TACOMA; Oct. 21.â An Invention, which,
if it accomplishes what Is claimed for It,
will revolutionize the steam vessel busi
ness. Is now being tested In the engineer's
room of- the Paciflc Cold Storage Com
pany. It is in effect an automatic stoker,
and steamboat men are watching its pro
gress with much Interest. It Is a simple
invention, but it Is claimed that it will
be the means of saving 30 per cent in the
cost of coal and dispense with the services
of many firemen.
The principle on which It is operated
is that of feeding the fire by means of a
forced draught carrying pulverized coal
from a hopper through Â¦ a gate Vhich
works automatically. The machine can
be] placed In a steamboat or any other
place. where generating apparatus Is used.
While It is necessary, to have the coal pul
verized In order to use It, the promoters
of "the Invention claim that the cost of so
doing. is very slight, while a saving of 50

TACOMA, Oct.' 22.â Ten thousand dollars

articles dear to the Indian heart are to
be clven away ' this week at Kluckwan.
Alaska, by Chief George Klarfish of* the
Chllkat tribe, who Is giving the greatest
potlatch known in Alaska In recent years.
For twenty years or more Klarflsh has
been saving money wijh the object of
some day rendering himself immortal bv
feasting and giving gifts to all his In
dian friends for 300 miles around. By hi3
Invitation more than 2000 Slwashes have
gathered at Kluckwan to share his boun
ty. A large part of the money invested In
the blankets now to be given away was
earned by his tribesmen In packing sup
plies ' across Chilcoot Pass during the
Klondike rush of three years ago.
Every house In the entire Kluckwan Is
filled to overflowing with guests and tem
porary quarters have been provided for
hundreds more. One of the chief features
of a* potlatch is to be sla hael and other
gambling games by means of which lucky
Indians will \rin everything possessed by
the unlucky. The El tka tribe of Indians
has seat the largest number of visitors,
for they were fortunate enough to gain

"He drove the finest trotters in Sara

seemed to like the attention he attracted.
He did not seem to care for women and
I don't think I ever saw him with one.
He had several friends in Saratoga and
drove them aTjout the village and down to
the lake, where he had expensive dinners.
F. A. Baker, attorney for the First Na
tional Bank, said to-night: "We have
located about $200,000 worth of. securities
and real estate in Alvord's name and shall
attach It Immediately. I think this will
bring the loss oÂ£ the hank down to $300,000.
We are trying to locate Alvord with de
tectives."
An official connected with the bank, who
did not wish his name given, said:
"Proof that the bank Is. not likely to
suffer for the defalcation is. that its profits
for the year ending last September were
11,350,600. > The surplus Is increasing fait.
The par value of the stock Is $100 a share,

paid' annual dividends of 100 per cent.
The First National Bank holds In stocks,
bonds and other securities, according" to
its latest reports, $24,073,910."
Bookmakers to-night talked of nothing
else but the story of the defalcation of the
note teller of the First National Bank.
Every bookmaker at the Saratoga race
track knew him. For them" his nod was
sufficient for a bet of thousands and
never Â¦Â¦' during the season did they have
to wait for the collection of his wagera.
Alvord's great build made him a marked
figure on the racetrack and at the Sara

At Norwich Governor Roosevelt lock an
entirely new subject to-night, touching
most upon State legislation. Referring to
his effort in framing legislation for New
York State he said:
"The act of Mr. Bryan is not sincere.
He claims that If the Democratic party
had -a chance they wouli. abolish trusts.
Well, he had four years In Congress and
during that time some or the million dol
lar trusts were formed syid I have not
heard that he raised his finger or his voice
to stop them. And then you remember
that the records of Congress show that
all but four Democrats in the House voteU
against the so-called anti-trust bill and
gave as their reason for so doing, througn
the mouth of Mr. Richardson, that If the
bill was passed they would have nothing
to make a paramount issue In this cam
paign."
as being marked to the last degree by
folly. , ' '
In spite of the rainstorm which set in
before the meetings the Governor talked
to crowded houses to-night.
"I. studied with interest what haÂ«1 been
done In New Zealand. New Zealand tried
very boldly a number of experiments in
dealing with corporate wealth. I also stud
led tlw laws of Massachusetts. But I can
tell yon cae State we only studied a little,
because we found nothing- in it. and that
was Nebraska. They had had Populistic
legislation there and we found some Iegis
latlrn to avoid, but we did not find any
thing the other way. I have strong hopea
that Nebraska will go Republican this
year, and if this happens I am willing
to guarantee that two or three years
hence we will find laws there affecting
labor and corporations which, will be good
for OS to carefully study In reforming our
laws, but there is not anything: there
now." ' : >"i

he said:
"I want to call your attention to a lit
tle incident that occurred last night In
New York. I think you can sometimes
know a man by the company he keep?*.
You can sometimes tell something about
a candidate by the peoole who are his
most active supporters. There â¢was a
Bryan meeting last night In New York.
In Cooper Union, I think. At that meet
ing Â»he morning papers report that the
two people who were most enthusiastical
ly received were* Aguinaldo o/ the Philip
pines and Altgeld of Illinois. I think it
was entirely proper to cheer one if you
cheered the other. It was entirely appro
priate to cheer the man who pardoned the
anarchists In this country and the man
who has been striking at our soldiers on
the other side of the earth. Now think of
a party that relies on that kind of sup
port, symbolized by the men who cheered
Altgeld and Aguinaldo as a great apostle
of freedom, and a few months ago a cer
tain Bryanite alluded to him as a second
George Washington. . You may not be
familiar with Agulnaldo's . history, so I
will give It to you briefly."
Continuing, Governor Ro.osevel: re
viewed, as he had In several previous
speeches, the career of Aguinaldo. He
tuen said:
â¢ Now, gentlemen, think of a party that
is reduced to champion that type of
man."
At Roxbury, a~few miles below Stam
ford. Governor Roosevelt was angered by
a man in the crowd in yelling. "Hurrah
for Bryan."
"Hurrah for Bryan?" said the Gov
ernor. "Why do you hurrah for Bryan?
When any man says 'hurrah for Bryan.*
I always feel like asking why."
A voice: 'They can't answer."
"Because Mr. Bryan has announced that
Mr. Croker is the prophet of Tammany
Hall and the State Is why they hurrah
for Bryan. . .. Â»- .
.-."Again, why -hurrah for Bryan? ,."VThy,
for the 4!-cem dollar, for the prospect of
cutting in two the"- nation's debt" by, the
simple process of cutting In two the na
tion's * honor. Is that a good reason for
saying 'Hurrah .for Bryan?' Why don't
you hurrah for Aguinaldo? You will, give
the greatest possible comfort to every
Malay bandit who Is shooting at the flag
if you help or aid the Brya-nlzed Democ
racy in any way. I make that distinction
between the Bryanlzed Democracy and
the Democracy of Jackson."
The committee .at Stamford had secured
the new opera-house for the addressee
and the party was driven there in car
riages. An audience that tested the ca
pacity of the house greeted Governor
Roosevelt as he walked upon the stage.
He said in part:
"Now, Mr. Bryan yesterday was speak

LOSFSTHB CASH IN SPECULATION
Alvord had been with the bank for
twenty years, and was one -of the most
trusted men in the institution. His steal
ings extended over a lone period, but no
suspicion of the truth was known until
ten days ago, when he sent word that he
was 111 at his home. Â¦ After he had been
away for a "day or two the bank put ex
perts at work and ?ome irregularities
were found. As the experts delved deeper
and deeper into" Alvord's books, the ex
tent of the robbery began to dawn on the
officers until they were overwhelmed to
find that It reached the enormous figure of
$700,000. Whether that sum is all he took
is not known.
It has not yet developed how the note
teller was able to put ' his hands on so
much money, but one of the directors Is
reported to have said that Alvord was
enabled to take such a large sum be
cause as note teller he was in charge of
the mail. This he opened every morning',
and he had ample opportunity to abstract
notes, drafts and checks, as well as
money. Of course he had to be especfally
skillful to make his accounts balance.
What Alvord did with all the cash is
also a mystery as yet. except that, as
usual In such cases. It Is said that a large
amount of it went in stock speculation.
One story Is .that _he_ lost $75,000 in one
deal, but what deal it was Is not stated.
It has been discovered that during the
summer Alvord visited Saratoga, where
he cut a great figure, spending money
like a prince. He rented and kept a 'fine
stable of horses.* and; besides playing the
races, is said to have frequented gambling
houses.
If these stories are true Alvord dis
played entirely . different , characteristics
than those he showed at home. In this
city he was' known as a man of very reg
ular habits. Among his associates he
was looked up to, and on Wall street was
known as "Happy" Alvord because of his
cheery ways. HJs^home was in the su
burb of Mount Vernon. This home Is a
magnificent place, located on Chester Hill,
one of the most artistic sections of the
town. It", is surrounded by luxurious
grounds and there are extensive stables.
Alvord has long been considered one of
the his men of the town. His family
entertained lavishly and gave large sums
to charity. He was prominent In church
circles, and his wife is considered one
of the most beautiful women in Mount
Vernon. '
It was not until this afternoon that. the
residents of Chester Hill heard oi his big
defalcation. There ; was:a rumor, that Al
vord left town the day 'the invitations
were canceled. 'and' that he took a
steamer for South America. This could
not be corroborated.
Late this afternoon Mrs. Alvord. wife
o^ the missing note teller, was seen at her
Mount Vernon -home. She was weeping
bitterly and ; would not talk about the
case-V. The? family consisted, of â¢ Mr. and
Mrs. Alvord,. two 'girls and a boy.-. They
kept four or five servants. ;
Mrs. Alvord is said to have told friends
that.- owing to his business position in the
bank. Mr. Alvord . was able* to obtain tips,
which , enabled him to' make $40,000 to
Â¦ $50,000 a' year 'over his salary by. operating
in" .Wall i street.' ' She ,1s / said â¢Â¦ to y have

vord, note teller of the First National
Bank of this city, is a fugitive and a de
faulter to the extent of $700,000.
The announcement of the defalcation,
which was made this afternoon, created
the utmost excitement in the financial dr
cles in this city, but the well-known sta
bility of the First National and a state
ment Issued by the bank had a quieting
effect. The statement was as follows: â¢
"The note teller, who has been In the
employ of the First National Bank for
many years. Is a. defaulter to a large
amount. His operations have continued
fcr a considerable period and have been

Spefcial Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ SEATTLE. Oct. 23.â The schooner Alice.
Captain Walter S. Milner, arrived early
this movnlng, twenty-six days from Nome.
Captain Mllner reports a tempestuous
voyage, with much damage to the rigging
of his vessel. Just previous to the big
storm at Nome the Alice lett the exposed
coast and made a run fdY Port Clarence.
The wind failed and the vessel drifted by
that shelter and in a dense fog was car
ried in four days through Bering Straits,
past Point Hope and into the Arctic Sea.
When the sun came out and there was
a chance to define the ship's position It
was found that she was beyond Point
Hope, with plenty of snow and Ice.
Captain Milner brings a story of a series
of terrible gales which it would be diffi
cult to parallel in the history of the
Alaskan coast. The Alice bears news con
cerning some of the sailing craft sup
posed to have been lost in Nome's great
storm. "
The Alice left Nome on the night of
September 25 and before the light had
faded ran into a, gale. This lasted until
she reached Unimak Pass, on September
29. and there she was becalmed a few
hours. A heavy southeast wind came up
and in five days the vessel experienced
six Intensely severe gales.
On Thursday morning, October 4, the
Alice got through the pass and then en
countered a series of gales which lasted
until she reached Cape Flattery. She lay
outside the cape from Saturday, October
13, to Sunday, October 21, unable to enter
on account of heavy southeast winds, and
experienced . two .terrific storms there.
When she finally entered the straits her
forestays were carried away, her fore
sails split, the flying Jib in ribbons, thu
topsails nearly useless and the mainsails
torn. The actual sailing time from Nome
was thirteen days. Â¦-''*!iiÂ£Â£
Â¦ while In the Arctic the Alice picked up
two shipwrecked crews of the schooners
Victoria and Lydia Mayflower, both of
which vessels went to pieces on the rocks
off Cape Prince of Wales. It was re
ported at the cape that twelve vessels
had been driven up Into the Arctic and
that the Alice was the first to come down.
?u^ Â« ort Clarence Captain Mlmer found
that five omlaks of Indians, I each hold
ing thirty-flye or forty persons; had left
Kings Island for the mainland. One ar
rived at Teller City while the Alice was
there and another landed farther up. Both
reported, that the other three boats, con
taining. more -than one hundred Indian*,
had gone down. .
The Francis Alice; purchased by Miner
Bruce, with a carpenter and four seamen
aboard, had. not been heard from when
the Alice left. The bark Oakland, driven
into Bering Sea, had gone to Port Clar
ence and on September 19 was commenc
ing to discharge lumber there. When tht
Alice entered Porti Clarence on Septembei
9 the bark Colom^ was anchored Just in
side Port Spencer. On leaving on Sep
tember 20 a square rigger was anchored
there, which Captain Mllner supposed was
her. The Little U the Wing and Wing
and the Carrier and Annie were all safe
at Grantly Harbor.
The Thomas F. Bayard was at Nome
on September 25. On that date the Robert
Dollar was reported at St. Michael and
was expected at Nome in a few days.

Negro Mother Recovers". Her Babe
Through a Writ of Habeas
-Corpus.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 23.â Two colored
women were fighting for the possession of
a 7-year-old boy in Judge Trask's court
to-day. One of them- Mrs. Belle Ellis,
was the child's mother, while the other,
Mrs. Belle Patten, made no claim to rela
tionship, but had the youngster in pawn
for an unpaid board bill.
Several months ago Mrs. Ellis, finding
that it was necessary > for her to go to
Bakersfield to get work, tbok the child to
Mrs. Patten's house, offering to pay $2 a
week If she would take care of the little
one for two or three months. Six months
passed and four months' boara was un
paid. -Mrs. Patten called on Mrs. Burke,
the mother .of Mrs. Ellis, and told the
old lady that unless her daughter cam*?
at once for her boy she would turn him
Into the street. â¢
On hearing this Mrs. Ellis returned,
calling on. Mrs. Patten for her child. The
latter, however, refused to deliver tho
child unless the unpaid board bill were
liquidated. Instead of paying Mrs. Ellis
applied for a writ of habeas corpus
which to-day resulted In the boy going
home with Its mother.
Mrs. Patten told the Judge she knew
that the boy would be taken from her, but
intended to hold on to him as long as the
law would allow her to, do so and perhans
Mrs. Ellis would pay the bill.

The investigation which was -begun yes
terday at the instance of the girl's cousin,
Mrs. James, has developed into a star
chamber proceeding, astounding in nature
and apparently one-sided In, Its effects.
The friends. of the unfortunate girl want
ed the testimony taken down In shorthand
In order to use, if necessary, in court pro

the principal witnessesâ those who could
Impart relevant testimonyâ came from

they had been solemnly sworn to secrecy
as to all they said and all that was asked
them. '

to set public sentiment against P. B.

once asked for a stimulant since given
Into their care. The taking oi testimony
was concluded this evening, but it is un
derstood that the Commissioners will re
serve their -decision till after they get but
of the Stockton atmosphere. The north
side of town, the Nob Hill, is wrought up
to such a degree that it is said that the
Frasers are the recipients of. marked so
cial slights. Mrs. Fraser, the stepmother
of but a few months, was/ up to the "pres
ent storm, one of the most popular ladies
in the city, but she is now suffering from
the general criticism.
It is thought that the officials concerned
in the commitment were to a degree im
posed" upon. Judge Budd could only take
the doctors' word for It and Is free from
blame. Dr. Sargent, one of the examin
ers, practically went back on his action a
few days afterward and Â»-ave out the Im
pression that he too, had some misgiv
ings. Dr. Ruggles Justifies his conclu
sions at the time, but does not make that
judgment cover Miss Fraser's present
condition, not having examined>the young
lady lately.
It was intimated this evening that the
findings of the Commissioners will be
against the girl. If this be so the fight
for her liberty will not end. While her
relatives other than her father are of
modest means they will not be embar
rassed for. funds to work with. A host
of sympathizers have been raised up and
satisfied of her sanity, they will make- a
good fight for her release from the mad
house. ' .._.;â¢. â¢Â¦Â¦ :â¢
Awev. Mr. Bryan - of the Episcopal
church, the girl's pastor, also volunteered
his opinion as .to. the young laay's sanity.
It Is said the nurses at the asylum re
futed the story that the patient was a
drug user; declaring that- she had not
taining for the girl proper legal aid should
the State Commissioners fail to release
her. Stories are afloat to the effect that
Albert Fraser, the brother, is the strong
est in the desire that his sister be placed
where she will not be able to gossip.
"Oh, I would like to talk," said Mrs.
James this evening, "but I was sworn to
secrecy. I'd like to tell the public all I
Know about this matter, but I cannot."
â¢ Nearly all of the witnesses were promi
nent ladles of this city, who went in the
hope of aiding* Miss Fraser, and. riot being
lawyers, they did not stop to question .the
Commissioners' , right to administer tho
oath of secrecy. One of, these wit
nesses was Mrs. W. D. Buckley, wife of
a local capitalist. She and her husband
entertained Miss Fraser one evening: and
at 10 o'clock walked home with her. At
the samenlght the> asylum car
riage, with attendants provldf* with
straps and. handcuffs, took the girl from
her home to the madhouse. Another friend
of Miss Ffaser was Mrs. Budd,' wife of
Judge Budd, who signed the commitment;

body.
Vaughn was captured by the officers at

Miss Jones had impelled him td it. He
was taken to Jeffereon and a strong puard
priced over him. He will be conveyed to
Salem at once, as a lynching is feared. "
Vaughn had been paying considerable
attention to the young girl, but his ad
vances were rejected. After calling her
from the room he enticed her into the
basement and there attacked her. Believ
ing that his victim. was dead he fled from
the building.

wounds received by the young lady as
fatal, the entire forehead and top of skull
being crushed in by the blows of the
ax. The jrlrl 15 the daughter of Mrs. J.

SAN RAFAEL, Oct 21â The trial of J. ,
E. King for the murder of 8. H. Church
at Two Rocks on July 23 was resumed
In the Superior Court this morning. Tha
v,*ork of selecting the remainder of the
jury proceeded rapidly and by noon tha
six needed Jurors wero accepted and
sworn in.
Daniel H. Ryan made the opening state
ment for the prosecution. He told In de
tail what the prosecution would attempt
to prove and closed by stating that ho
would supply the jury with enough evi
dence to Justify a verdict of murder UÂ»
the first degree. At the request of the
defense the court made an order direct
ing that all witnesses In the case be ex
cluded from the courtroom.
The first witness examined was Dr. O.
E. Ivancovich of Petaluxna, who attended.
Church after the shooting. He described
the wound Inflicted by the bullet from
King's weapon. When an effort was be
ing made to prove by him that Churcii
had made a dying statement the doctor
testified that Church said to him:
"Here lies a man who never prayed."
Just what followed the doctor waa not
allowed to describe.
Silas It. Stice, a son-in-law of Church,
and who was with him on the day of the
shooting, testified that King tried to
water his horses at his trough. He told
King to go away and King, who wad
accompanied by his wife, led his horses
back to their camp on the county road.
Stice thought that they might get water
out of a well near the road so he took a
hammer and nails and accompanied by
Church went down to nail up the we*l.
After doing this he and Church told King,
who was in his tent, not to go upon tha
property any more. No violent language
was used until King exclaimed. "I'll shoot
hell out *of you." i The witness then ran
and King shot at him. but missed.
Stice was here called from the stand
and County Surveyor G. Richardson was
sworn and asked to explain the map he
had made of scenes of the shooting. The
case was then continued until to-morrow
morning. It Is expected that It will bo
finished before Saturday.

Because of alleged complicity In the're

LONDON. Oct. 24.â Replying to re
marks of the Newmarket correspondent
of tne Times, who on Monday defended
American Jockies against Lord Durham's
attacks, the earl to-day writes a long let
ter to the Times containing the following
extracts:
"I have never condemned the 'style* of
American riding or American training.
On the contrary, I share in the respect
which all Newmarket trainers feel for the
character and abilities of Messrs. Hug
gins and Pincus. Two years ago, .in a
public speech, I welcomed the advent of
Sloan as productive of good rather than
evil. -Â¦Â¦:;;Â« â
"But I do disapprove the methods of the
American Jockeys and I do not welcome
the influx of their followera. who consider
horse racing merely as an Instrument for
high gambling."
In giving his reasons for his remarks.
Lord Durham emphasized the fact that
the latter were made before the Escurlals
race and immediately after Clarehaven
won the Czarowltch. He says he does not
agree with the decision of the stewards In
the Escurlals case and considers that
they ought to have investigated Lester
Reiff's riding in other races.
"Space forbids," he continues, "an enu
meration of all the instances of unscru
pulous riding on the part of the Ameri
cans, although I have no complaint
against Maher, who rides very well and
seems a most respectable boy. '
Proceeding to detail Sloan s suspensions
and reprimands, he observes: "I don't
think It right in the Interests of, the turf
that Sloan should be a prominent buyer
at the Doncaster yearling sales or that
one of his followers should be the Ameri
can trainer for whom he has been en
deavoring to obtain a license at New
"Martin has twice been disqualified this
year and Rlgby was reprimanded at the
Liverpool July cup; but the warning has
no effect on Rlgby's reckless riding. His
Serformances at Gatwick last week were
istinctly dangerous.
"So much for the prominent American
Jockeys. I prefer an Increase of English
bays to augmentation of the existing num
ber of Americans If the methods of the
latter are to be similar to the methods of
those I have named."
Finally, referring to in and out riding,
he expressed regret that the stewards did
not ask an explanation of Spectrum's run
ning at the first July meeting and of
Clarehaven's Caarowitch. "In the inter
ests of Mr. Newmann and of honorable
sportsmen like Mr. Whitney," said Lord
Durham, "such an investigation was emi
nently desirable*" /
The Sportsman publishes an Interview
â¢with Lord Durham in which he repeats
that nothing has been further from his
wishes than to cast aspersions on all rac
ing men. He declared that he has always
welcomed American, French and colonial
competition on the English turf as pro
ductive of friendly rivalry and good for
the improvement of horse breeding.
Says- He Is Not: Opposed to
American Jockeys' Style
of Riding.

It was in the neighborhood of 10 o'clock
when the four men lifted the partly un
consclous girl into Schulthors' rig. It Is
alleged that after -the -hackman had been
called one of the men asked for another
round of drinks an<i ln'o that served to
the girl .poured the contents of a vial
that held "knock-out" drops. The men
directed the driver to take them to a
roadhouse, but they found the- place
closed and repeated rapplngs produced no
response. The party then started back
toward the city.
In a lonely spot the hack was stopped
and the girl lifted out of It and laid upon
a blanket by the roadside. In what fol
lowed the hackman and one of the four. It
Is said,- had no part. The story Is too re
volting to describe. The hackman claims
that he did not leave his seat on the cab.
He was unable to say whether the girl
was -dead or alive when she was lifted
back into the cab. He remembers that he
was told to drive down by the river bank.
Here the girl, apparently lifeless, was
lifted out of the cab and her head and
face bathed with river wa.ter. After a
long time spent in trying to revive her
the men held a consultation. Their vic
tim was again lifted into the cab and the
hackman was ordered to drive like mad
to Dr. Wiley's house. Dr. Wiley was not
at home, and the party hurried to the res
idence of Dr. Townsend." The physician
was aroused and told to come down stairs
at once and give Immediate attention to
a woman who had been injured. He was
told not to wait to dress. He slipped on
a bath robe and went out to the carriage
door. He felt the girl's pulse and then
stepped back, saying his services were not
needed as the girl was dead.
One of the men cursed the doctor for a
fool and commanded him to revive her.
The doctor turned and started back into
the house. The men then changed their
demeanor and begged him to do something
for the girl. Then the doctor assured
them that it was useless, as the girl was
dead and beyond help. The carriage then
drove away, but came back in a few min
utes and the men urged Dr. Townsend to
resort to anything to bring the girl about.
He again explained that the girl was be
yond medical aid. . The doctor was offered
any amount of money if he would try, but
he persisted that it was useless for him to
try. as death had come long before.
The carriage then drove away.' There
was a consultation among the men. One
wanted to take the body to the girl's
home and leave it there. The other three
refused to consider this and insisted on
dropping the body on the roadway. It
was finally resolved to drive out into Ber
gen County by, way of the Thirty-third-
Finally one of the men telephoned to the
Erie station for a carriage, and August
Schulthors .responded. This hackman has
been the main source of the police's in
formation and has given a detailed story
of what occurred.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â Police Investiga
tion Into the death of Miss Jennie
Bosschleter of Paterson, N. J., reveals one
of the most remarkable and revolting
crimes which has ever been brought to
light in this section. The police have the
five persons more or less concerned In the
affair In custody. From statements an-1
confessions, made they have been able to
trace the course of the girl from 8:30
Thursday evening until she met death,
and the travels of her body afterward are
also fairly well- known. | Shortly after. S
o'clock Miss Bosschieter passed Kent's
drugstore at Paterson and near it met
Andrew Campbell. There was a short
conversation and then the pair walked
down Main street. Somewhere en route
they were Joined by George Kerr, Walter
McAlister and William Death. The four
entered Christopher Saal's saloon. Here
drinks were served.
Four Men Under Arrest for an Atrocious
Deed That Brings Death to a Pretty
POISON A YOUNG WOMAN
WHILE PLANNING HER RUIN
street bridge. "When the bridge was
reached the driver was again ordered to
stop. The purpose soon developed.
When the triple attack upon the uncon
scious and pernaps dead girl was made a
portion of her clothing had been torn off.
When the party left the scene of the
crime one man had a portion of her cloth
ing In a pocket of his coat and another
had the remainder of the garments. When
the stop was made at the river bank to
bathe the girl's face and head her combs
and pins had been removed. Those were
in McAllster's pocket. The two portions
of the garment and the combs and 'hair
pins were dropped from the bridge into
the Passalc River. The carriage was
then driven a short distance along thÂ©
road Into Bergen County. The spot was
decided - upon as a good place to
drop the corpse. The body was
dragged out of the carriage, but Just 'then
a wagon was heard approaching and one
of the men hurled the body back Into the
cab, exclaiming: "For God's sake, drive
on! Here comes a carriage!" *
The hack went on until a dark spot near
Alca's Mills was reached. Another of the
men lifted the shoulders, and as the hips
reached the sill McAlister dropped the
feet and the two men held the body up
right for a moment and then let It go.
The girl's body fell backward, the head
striking a rock, which crushed the skull.
This circumstance, which threw the Ber
gen County authorities off the scent, was
not foreseen by the. men disposing of the
body. The hackman received $10 for his
night's work. This was paid by McAlis
ter. ' .
This Is the story as detailed by detec
tives. The four men directly concerned
in this affair and the hackman are pris
oners. The hackman has told all he
knows, and two of the others have con
firmed his story. It Is said that Death
and Campbell are the two men who told
all and that Kerr has also confessed. Mc-
Allstcr alone is said to deny the affair as
detailed.
Walter McAllster is a member of the
firm of James McAlister & Co., silk
throwsters. George Kerr Is a member of
the* firm of J. P. Donleavy Paint Co.
Andrew Campbell Is a .bookkeeper em
ployed at the Hand-street silk mill. Wil
liam Death is a young man who was mar
ried five weeks ago. Mrs. Death's friends
are endeavoring . to conceal the story of
the details of her husband's arrest, and
she is convinced that a mistake has been
made.
The men ' Implicated in the crime were
held 'without bail after a hearing before
Recorder Senior to-day.
Judge Kerr, brother of one of the pris
oners, Is married to a sister of Mayor
Hinchcliffe, the millionaire brewer of Pat
erson. He is also a relative of John John
son, Democratic nominee for Congress In
the Paterson district.
The funeral' of the dead girl was held
this afternoon. To avoid a crowd it was
announced that services had been post
poned by the Coroner. It is claimed at
Paterson to-night that the affair is only
one of a series of crimes In which mill
girls of that city have been victims, but
this Is the first case known In which any
of the girls have lost their lives.

CALL BUREAU. TrELLTNGTON
HOTEL, TVASHINGTON. Oct. 13.
There Is a disposition In Wash
ington, to believe that the agree
ment made by Germany and
Great Britain and presented to several
other powers for their adherence Is not
the only pact those two nations have
formed. This belief finds its basis In
the third article of the published agree
ment and the understanding of the au
thorities is that the Berlin and London
governments would not be likely to an
nounce their purpose to "reserve the right
to come to a preilmlncry understanding"
in case any move is made to dismember
Chlca without having determined in ad
vance â¢what that preliminary agreement
Is. As to a decision having been reached
to dispose of territory outside of China
nothing is known here, and it seems to
be the opinion of well informed official?
thai the Berlin press is in error on this
point. No doubt is expressed that during
the Emperor's famous visit to England
some months ago an arrangement was
made with Great Britain which brought
about a satisfactory definition of the Ger
man, boundary line in South Africa and
the non-interference of the German Gov
ernment In the Boer war and it is consid
ered that the latter agreement Is simply
a continuance of the policy of mutual
friendship and co-operation embarked
upon by the two nations at that time.
An effort was made to-day in an en
tirely irresponsibly circle to chow that
Great Britain and Germany in reaching
an agreement as to the action to be taken
In territory outside of China referred par
ticularly to the Western Hemisphere and
the proposed Nicaragua canal, but in au
thoritative quarters this statement is re
ceived â¢with no favor.
Secretary Hay Is preparing an answer
to the Invitation of Great Britain and
Germany to adhere to the agreement that
they have reached and in the meantime i9
collecting Information as to toe interpre
tation to be placed upon article three.
No doubt Is felt here that Russia Is the
Government against whom Great Britain
and Germany make the threat Incorporat
ed In the third article and there Is no
doubt also that Russia understands this
as well as does the United States.
The agreement will certainly accomplish
or.e resultâ it will i/icrease the tension be
tween Great Britain and Germany on one
band and Russia on the other and make
more difficult the task of the United
States to preserve harmony of action. The
best information in possession of the
State Department is that Russia, acting
as this Government propose* to do, Â¦will
formulate a reply acknowiedping adher
ence to the principles set forth In the
Anglo-German agreement and then. In or
der to avoid giving the two hostile govern
ment* any ground for carrying out their
threat to take such action for protection
of their own Interests In China as they
may deem necessary, will, as soon as pos"
slble, begin the withdrawal of her troops
from Manchuria. .
LONDON. Oct. 23.â The officials of the
British Foreign Office say the Anglo-
German agreement will not affect Rus
sia's railroad concessions in Manchuria,
They point out that the object of the
agreement Is the upholding of the Integ
rity of China, without reference to the
arrangements of the powers regarding
the construction of railroads In China.

LONDON, Oct. 23.â The Globe this after
noon announces that Great Britain has
leased 'from the English contractors the

course of construction, for a period of
eight months, with the object of landing
men and stores there and utilizing the
branch railroad thence to Tangho, where
it joins the main line to Peking.
Harbor Works Leased.
The Vossische Zeitung, referring to the
report that the United States before giv
ing a final answer wishes Germany and
Great Britain to explain what they mean
by clause three," that Is, whether if'an
other power seizes territory they Intend
to recoup themselves by annexations, and
whether they Intend to prevent seizure by
force, says: "The answer to such a ques
tion will probably be that Germany and
Great Britain have not reached a decision
on that point, but intend to decide only
after a seizure shall have occurred, since
the decision must depend upon the inter
ests involved."
The press continues a lively discussion
of the agreement. ThÂ© Hamburg Corre
spondent, which Is often the mouthpiece
of the Foreign Office, refers to the sus
picion expressed In some foreign news
papers that certain clauses in the agree
ment are kept secret, and asserts that no
secret clauses exist.
BERLIN*. Oct. 23.â A high official of the

M. Plnchon Is sick and suggesting that
the French Government appoint another

Foreign Affairs, M. Deleasse, having re
ceived the same day a dispatch from M.
Plnchon which did not refer to his health
considers that Li Hung Chang's sugges
tion is open to suspicion and has cabled
to M. Pinchon on the subiect. The lat
ter's reply has not yet been received.
The Temps, which Is a semi-official or
gan, says under a Londdh date:
"The belief in diplomatic circles is that
the Anglo-German agreement is purely a
mutual guarantee against either country
seizing the Yangtse Valley. Germany,
even if not in an economic crisis, is at
least in serious embarrassments owing
fo considerable overproduction brought
about by the enormous industrial machin
ery which she has created at a great cost.
She, therefore, seeking commercial out
lets, casts her eyes on China and especial
ly on the Yangtze Valley, and fearing
England might attempt to seize the Yang
tse Valley 6he signed the published agree
ment. Diplomats are convinced that no
secret clause exists. The thrid article ap
plies to the eventuality of Russia defin
itely seizing Manchuria, in which case
Germany and England would divide the
Yangtse Valley. But there are reasons to
believe this will not occur, because Rus
sia Is determined not to seize Manchuria."

CHICAGO, 6ct. 23.â The Hiriton baseball cannon, which Is now at Marshall
field for Director A. A. Stags to experiment with, is an interesting,
though somewhat complicated piece of apparatus for trainlrg battenea.
When mounted ready for action it looks like an old Spanish gun. but,
judging from the way in which Professor St&gg dodged a hot lnshoot
the other day. It has more action. The cannon Is about two feet and a half long:,
and the muzzle is just large enough for the regulation sized baseball. The re
markable part of the gun is the arrangement for making it shoot curves. This
consists of two parallel wooden fingers attached to the muzzle by a narrow cylin
der. The inner side of the nngers and the cylinder are lined with rubber tape,
When the ball comes out of the cannon the fingers throw it out of its natural
course a little, thus giving the desired curve. Outs, ins and drops can be secured
by changing the position of the cylinder holding the fingers. Attached to the
breach of the cannon is a ten-foot rod hollowed like a rifle barrel. A small rifia
barrel attached to a rifle stock is inserted in this barrel, and the rifle stock
placed in "position on a stand behind the gun. This makes a Joined barrel
which can be shortened or lengthened at will. This regulates the speed at which
the ball will be fired, the rate being faster when the barrel Is shortened. The
ball is fired by the powder and gases going into the cannon through the rod. Just
back of the ball Is a small disk which spreads the powder so that It will not
damage the ball. Professor Charles H. Hinton of Minneapolis Invented the gun
several years ago, when he was professor of mathematics at Princeton Uni
versity. Princeton baseball players used it while he was experimenting to per
fect the scheme.

when the now boat is ready, she will be

In part:
Nothing in our lives verifies the sincerity and
cmuinenecs of our profession more than what
we do and leave undone. By our acts we are
known and measured. The light and life of
oar influence reaches far or near in propor
tion to the truth and Intensity with which we
dipnlfy and impress our principles.
In the convening of this convention, in the
planning of Kb members for carrying forward
the special work of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, we republlsh and re
emphaalze our convictions and give expression
to a faith and aspiration which alone enables
the weak fÂ»> prevail against the mighty. We
are an organisation maintaining Itself for the
good it may accomplish. No reward is ours.
no cherished hope is ours beyond the blessings
imposed by the laws of love, developing and
improving human society. With one heart,
one thought, vitalized with the : truth and the
?plrlt of love, may we not hope for transform
ing the world into the likeness, of Neal Dow,
feonriety and Christlllce nobility.
With head and heart we oppose the attitude
of a nation dominated by the spirit of com
mercial greed and condemn a Government
financially in league with fraud and willing to
go down Into the poisonous, murderous pits of
the whisky still for revenue.a Government deaf
to the prayers and pleadings of mothers for the
protection of their sons from a forced contact
with the army canteen.

make any specific guarantee as to how
long the 10 per cent offer is to run. and
from conversations had with a number of
them It can be said with every assurance
that they will not make any speclflq guar

Lackawanna said:

"In order to avoid the complications

adopt a general average and 6ell to their

SCRANTON, Pa., Oct. 23.â A meeting of
superintendents representing most of the
large companies of the Lackawanna-Wyo
mlng Valley region was held here to-day
In the offices of the Temple Iron Com
pany and an agreement was made to post
the following notice:
Advance Will Continue.
Do Not State, However, How Long
OPERATORS POST NOTICES.
Rain Â¦ fell heavily during the morning,
but the large crowd, estimated at nearly
6000 persons, did not seem to mind the
downpour. John Fahey, president of the
district, presided. President Mitchell's
speech was listened to with great interest.
His most Important utterance bearing dl-,
rectly on the ending of the strike was as
follows:
"I believe It will bo but a few days
longer until the operators in the Hazle
ton, Lackawanna and Wyoming valleys
will consent to post notices agreeing to
pay the 10 per cent Increase In wages un
til April L I believe that If you stand
together the rest of this week by Monday
at least you can return to work with
everything won you struck for."
President Mitchell then made a plea
that all remain loyal to the organization
after the contest Is over Just as they are
doing now. ;
President Mitchell was asked on his ar
rival from Pottsville to-night on what he
based his belief that the strike would
end this week,- but he declined to say any
thing other than that the proposition of
the miners was so fair that he could see
no valid reason why the operators should
not accept. President Mitchell declined
to say what course would be pursued if.
one or more companies refused to guar
antee the payment of the increase until
April. '
A meeting of the national executive
board of the United Mine-workers of.
America and the officers of the three an
thracite districts will be held here to
raorrow for the purpose, Mr. Mitchell
pays, of thoroughly canvassing the situa
tion. He would not say whether the con
ference would take any positive action
looking â¢ toward the â¢ calling off of tha
strike. If any action will be taken, he
said, It would depend entirely upon what
the canvass would show. In answer to
another question the iabor leader said ht)
would not take the responsibility upon
himself of calling off the strike, but would
rather have the national board vote upon
the question. : Â¦ Â¦- Vl-
POTTSVILLB, Pa.. Oct. '23.â President
Mitchell in his" speech this afternoon said
he believed that in a few days all the op

A FEW DAYS
Hobbs could have been elected to any
office in the gift of the citizens at that
period, but he decided to return home.
He will reach this city In the early part
of next month and "Pete" Smith, coach
and manager of the Reliance team, ex
pects to secure ,hls services as center on
the Reliance football team. Pete also has
a promise from Code that he will play
quarterback and has nearly gained the
consent of Bert Oliver, the Oakland giant,
to play guard.
Hobbs' blood became heated and he tola
the committee to go to a place where
they could thaw out. The committee re
fused to thaw, however, and the battle
was on. After a Â¦week of waiting by both
sides. Hobbs took the bull by the horns.
He was tired of the northern region and
decided that "Frisco" was the only spot
on earth for him. As he could not dis
pose of his beer by sale, he decided to
give it away, knowing well that he would
work havoc with the sales of his rivals.
i-e invited the whole camp or that por
tion of the camp that was thirsty to be
his guests and for one week they literally
swam in beer. The saloon-keepers closed
their places of business during the flow
of the foaming liquid and gazed In dis
gust at the long line of thirsty miners
pouring into the brewery.
for his beer. He thought that $20 a keg
was enough and made a motion to that
effect. A trust was immediately formed
and a committee went to Hobbs to ask
him to lower his price on boer.
To avoid this and to make more money
â¢was a problem that had be solved at any
cost. One dispenser of strong waters sug
gested that Hobbs was charging too much
According: to Code "Billy" Hobbs start
ed a brow^ry in Nome six months agn>
and during the first five months reaped
a harvest selling its product to the saloon
keepers for fSO a keg. So elated was Hobbs
v-lth h'.s success that he ordered a large
Fupply of the foaming liquid from this
city. TJie salonn-kpepers thought they
were not making enough profit in dis
pensing beer at 13 a glass and held a meet
ing to devise ways and means by which
they could further enrich themselves. It
developed that the thirsty miners would
not pay more than one hundred cents for
a braker and if the saloon men raised the
price on them they would relieve the
parched feeling in their throat by some
other method.

WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
Is Not What Hakes a Remedy
Valuable.
Testimonials are good things and we
are always glad to get them, but they
don't make our remedy any better.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are good be-
cause they do good â because they cure.
Testimonials simply prove that the Tab-
lets have helped other people, but It's
yourself you are most interested In. and
whether they will cure you is the Ques-
tion.
It is very easy to find outâ try them.
A full package costs but fifty cents at
your druggist's. They are worth that If
they only help you a little bit. The chance
Is worth taking at the price.
We put it on that basis because you
don't know about the tablets. If you
knew as much about them as we do you
would have complete confidence: this ad-
vertisement would be unnecessary. We
have seen them cure the worst cases of
stomach trouble. Cases of long standing
and obstinacy, cases that other medicines
and even high priced doctors had failed
to subdue.
Here are some testimonials. If yon
; care to read them we have thousands of

We honestly believe that Stuart's Dys-

"One-Armed Kid" Lewis. "Frenchy"
Odette, "Hot-Air" Pancke. Harry War
nick and ' Messengers Roach and Royce
were the prime movers in securing medi
cal attendance for Trost.
Trost is one of the many aspiring ama
teur boxers who have come into public
view since the organization of the alleged
athletic clubs that have sprung up In this
city during the last few months like
mushrooms after a rain. He la considered
clever with the padded mitts, and is in
demand by the local clubs. Like scores
of his rivals the only training he gets is
in the gymnasium after working hours.
A paltry prize of $15 Incites him. as It
does many other lads, to enter the ring
and fight a four-round bout for a decis
ion. That these fights result in bruises
and often-tlmes injury to the - untrained
lighters is evidenced by their condition
after going through a mill..
More care should be-taken by the fight
promoters in arranging these . amateur
bouts. Every week one or the other of
these mushroom clubs gives its "monthly
exhibition." and some of those who take
part are unfitted to do battle. If more
care is not taken another fatality will be
added to the list. ,
If "Harry had fallen on the pavement or
got kicked by a mule he would probably
not be at the French Hospital, but he
acquired the broken jaw In the roped
arena, while, on October 13, before the
Golden Gate Athletic Club, engaged In a
four-round pugilistic contest with one
"Bach" Reconl, who has a wild" right
swing. Trost has gone through many
ring encounters without serious damage
to himself, but the spaghetti energy be
hind Reconi's blow was too much for the
jawbone to resist, and now Harry lies,
the wounded hereof many â¢ encounters,
with the humble members of the messen
ger service watching that none of the
wants of the one .who has brought .them
honor shall be overlooked.
Harry Trost, one of the lads employed
by the California Special Service Com
pany, is lying at the French Hospital re
ceiving, treatment for a broken jaw. The
expense of this Is something beyond the
accumulations of an ordinary messenger
boy. but Harry doesn't have to worry.
His fellow '- messengers ar<Â» footing â¢ the
expense, each one contributing so much
a week. i '.
"When a messenger-boy rises from the
humble ranks of his calling and crawls
to a dizzy height on the ladder of fame
his fellows are willing to demonstrate
that there is nothing too good for him.
Of one who brings glory to the calling
they are proud, and they stand ready
to honor him, no matter what the cost.

A DISPATCH from Fort Bragrg
state6 that the steam schooner
Sunol, while lying at anchor at
Little River, was j entirely con
sumed by fire at an early hour
yesterday morning. The fire started in
the cook's galley and Â¦ was caused
by the explosion of a coaloil
lamp. The burning oil spread rapidly
over the decks of the steamer,
and the flames gained such headway that
the crew was unable to pain control and
was forced to abandon the vessel to her
fate.
Captain Green was in his cabin at the
time of the explosion. Before he had a
chance to take any of his belongings the
flames shot up around him, and he was
forced to Jump to the lower deck to save
himself. He was considerably ehaken up,
and !s compelled to hobble about on
crutches. The crew escaped uninjured.
The Sunol was owned by C. A. Hooper
& Co. of this city and was uninsured.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 23.â Many Inquir
ies have been made recently at the Pen
sion Office as to the status of claims filed
for pensions by soldiers of the Spanish-
American war. Commissioner Evans said
z<*-Oa.y that the bureau scarcely had tlme
to respond to all the Inquiries, but that
the claims were being adjudicated as rap-
Idly as possible.
He added that some. of the claims had
been delayed by the difficulty la obtaining
the necessary official records at the War
Department.
"There have been filed 34,000 claims on
account of the Spanish-American war up
to Monday niornir.g. October 22." said the
Commissioner. "Calls have been made for
evidence in 25.424 of thfse claims. Medical
examinations have been ordered by this
bureau In 2S.224 claims. The difference
between the number of claims filed and
the number of medical examinations
ordered practically represents the num
ber of widows and dependents claims;
4237 of these claims have been adjudicated
already.

Is Doing Its Utmost and at
Present All Are Being
Treated Alike, .

He believes a great mistake was made in

mistake to retain General Linares as

that five of the Mlnleters are generals.

in that city eng'aged- in the business of importing
Chinese laundrymen. A representative of the Con

for the purpose of obtaining information about the

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
While the -Bryanites have said nothing. about the
currency bill during the campaign.the declaration of
their platform is nevertheless worth keeping in mind.
Bryan is known to be reckless in matters oi finance.
Should he attain the Presidency with a 'Democratic
Congress to support him the whole financial system
of the Government will be disturbed and all business
paralyzed. For that reason, as well as for
equally good,, the '.conservatism of the country v pcr-
The currency law <focs more than remove all
doubt concerning the standard of value. It directs
that all forms of money issued or . coined by the
United States shall be maintained at a parity of value
with this standard, and it is made the duty of the Sec
retary of the Treasury to maintain such parity. Bet
ter banking facilities for the country districts are pro
vided by \his act, the minimum capital being reduced
to $25,000 in. places of not over 3000 population. Un
der thi5 section 244 new banks have been organized,
with a capital of $10,000,000. Perhaps the most notable
feature of the new currency law is that which relates
to the refunding of the national debt. The 5 per cents
of 1904, the 4 per cents of 1007, and the 3 per cents of
1908, the principal of which aggregates. $839, 146,400,
were authorized to be refunded into 2 per cent bonds,
payable at the pleasure of the United States after
thirty years from the date of their issue, and payable,
principal and interest, in gold coin of the present
standard value. Under the refunding provision the
treasury effected a net saving of. interest : amounting
to $6,664,454 on bonds replaced, -between March 14
and May i,.ipoo. If all the bonds. open to refunding
should be exchanged the saving in interest will reach
over $20,000,000.
them in debate on the issue.
Of-all-that waspromised by that plank of the plat
form the S^'anites have given us little or nothing.
Hardly a single piping voice has been heard in the
way of denunciation of the currency bill, or in appeals'
to the people to vote for Bryan because of his oppo
sition to it. In one lespect that is unfortunate, for it
would have been well to have had the attention of the
country directed to the measure in order that all
might have learned how far it has been successful.
The effects of^the operation of tne act have thus far
justified the wisdom of the men who enacted it, and
they could with safety challenge *any Bryanite to meet
ONE of the planks of the Kansas City platform
that Bryan promised to make use of runs thus:
'"We denounce the currency bill enacted at the
last session of Congress as a step forward in the Re
publican policy which aims to discredit the sovereign
right of the National Government to issue all money,
whether coin or paper, and to bestow upon national
banks the power to issue and control the volume of
paper money for their own benefit. A permanent na
tional bank currency, secured by -Government bonds,
must have a permanent debt tp-rest upon, and if the
bank currency is to increase with population and busi
ness, the debt must also increase. ' The Republican
currency scheme is, therefore, a scheme for fasten
ing upon the taxpayers a perpetual and growing debt
for the benefit of the tanks. We are opposed to this
private corporation paper circulated as money, but
without legal tender qualities, and demand the retire
ment of national bank notes, as fhe Government paper
of silver certificates can, be substituted for them."
AN ISSUE ThJAT WAS DROPPED.
The Federal Government has decided that we need
a new map of Alaska., This, however, was not made
necessary by .the fact that certain sections of the terri
tory were blown off the map by recent storms.
If any voter of the district be in doubt as to tht
comparative merits of the two candidates let him ask
of those *"ho know the record made by White and
that made by Wolfe at Sacramento. Both have been
tried in office. Each has an established reputation in
politics. Let the voters judge them by what they have
done and vote accordingly.
The Republicans of the Twenty-first Senatorial
District should have no difficulty in deciding which
of these men to vote for. It is well known that Kelly
and Critnmins arc more injurious than helpful to the
Republican party. Indeed the indignation of honest
Republicans once drove the two bosses out of the
party and thoroughly discredited them. They would
never have had any influence in the p'arty again had
not the Southern Pacific managers brought them to
the front to do railroad politics at the primaries as
soon as the primary law was declared invalid. The
nomination of Wolfe is one of the results of their re
turn to pov,er in the Twenty-first District. To elect
Wolfe to the State Senate would be to indorse Kelly
and Crimmins. It would be an affront to true Repub
licanism, to the interests of the district and to the
cause of honesty in the State government *â¢ '
The man whom Kdly and Crimmins, supported .by
the Southern Pacific "push." nominated against Mr.
White is the notorious "Ed&e" Wolfe. As Mr.
White was chosen by the Citizens' Republican con
vention because the people can count upon him, so
Wolfe was chosen by the bosses and the corporations
because those corrupt forces can count upon
Wolfe. In this case ccch side has chosen a represen
tative candidate. The supporters of genuine Repub
licanism have nominated a representative of honest
politics, and the suppoiters of corruption have chosen
a man whose reputation in the Legislature is suffi
ciently well known to make it certain he will stand
up for all the bosses tnd the railroad desire.
Mr. White has served in the Assembly and :s
known to be 2n abl*. faithful and efficient legislator.
His record in office is itself a sufficient evidence of
his right to ask again the confidence and the suffrages
cf the people. In the whole course of his service at
Sacramento there is no act of his that can be cited
against him, not one that would bring upon him the
condemnation of good men. He has the character
2nd the reputation of z.n honest legislator, and to that
fact he owes his nomination by the Citizens' Republi
can convention.
AMONG the candidates nominated by the Citi
zens' Republican convention who merit the
support of all Republicans who are loyal to the
. best traditions of their party is William E. While,
candidate for the State Senate in the Twenty-first Dis
trict. By that nomination the convention placed be
fore the voters of the district a straight fight against
the Kelly and Crimmins combination. It is a plarn
. cnoice oi electing a Senator who will honestly rep
resent the people or one who will be no more than
a tool of corrupt corporations and the bosses.
TO BEAT THE BOSSES.
TEACHERS PLAN FOR
AMENDMENT NO. 15
The teachers of San Francisco have drafted this appeal to the voters of
California to support constitutional amentment No. 15, through which they
hope to get the moneys justly due them as salary for the months of Novem
ber and December, 1858.. This appeal was drafted by a special committee ap
pointed at the teachers' meeting held last week. It Is as follows: . . â¢
TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA: Vote YES on Senate constitutional amend
ment No. 15, which is the seventh on the ticket. This provide* that the city and county
of San Francisco may at any time pay the 'salaries of its teachers, due for services
rendered In November and December. 1S93, because:
1. The failure to pay these salaries was a great Injustice to the teachers and a
serious reflection on the good name of the city.
2. San Francisco meets the entire indebtedness; the State at large pays none of It.
3. The amendment permits, but does not compel, the 8an Francisco Supervisors to
pay these claims, / . . .
4. It has been /legally determined that the only means of paying this debt to the
teachers Is by the adoption of this amendment by the State at larse.

Mr. Bryan resorts V> another clever trick
in politics. He again offers himself as the
savior of the nation. In 1S9S he told the
people that unless they adopted th3 free
and unlimited coinage of silver business
would never revive and the country would
go to ruin. This year he tells them that
unless they adopt his policy â¢ as regards
the Philippine Islands freedom and liberty
will be endangered and the very existence
of the republic threatened.
Bryan as President would be a menace
to peace as well as to commerce. The
President has everything to do with our
foreign relations, and a President of Bry
an's impetuosity, radicalism and inordi
nate ambition would have us involved in
international difficulties upon the slight
est pretext. Bryan is an extremist of the
worst kind, and the great and sometimes
delicate problems that arise In the admin
istration of the affairs of the nation de
mand a temperate consideration, which he
is incapable of giving to anything.
W. D. McHUGH.
Omaha; Neb., Oct. 14, 1200.
; -,w UDGE " : W. D. McHUGH of Oniaha,
j for sojtne years a, leader.. of ~ the
I Democratic forces In " Nebraska, is
.%J : , as strongly- opposed to Bryan in
; Â¦ ; this campaign as he was In- 1S96.
when he bolted the Chicago platform. In
1S93 and 1S52 Judge McHugh was among
theÂ»" most; active > workers for Mr. Bryan
in. his CpngTessiqnal campaign, l?ut in
1SS3,^ when the present Presidential candi
date forced free coinage of silver
upon the party in' Nebraska and made it
a I conspicuous and leading issue, the
Judge ceased to be oqe of his supporters.
In the following statement Ju^ge" Mc-
Hugh tells why he. cannot support Bryan:
Editor ; San Francisco ,CalU - When
Bryan was first put up as a Congressional
candidate he was an unknown quantity.
After his election ' he displayed marked
ability as . an - advocate of tariff reform,
which was at that time the dominating
issue In the politics of the country. On
the tariff issue I supported him for Con
gress again in 18S2, but .when later on,
he appeared as the champion of free sil
ver, free riot and free everything else
that" he thought- would' make votes, I
could not continue in his political com
pany. . I 'think I have a pretty clear in
sight of the man's iCharacter now. His
actions during the last six or seven years
have shown him to be a man who. does
not and will .not hesitate to > deceive the
people when he. believes such deception
will advance his own - political interests.
He is absolutely selfish and inconsiderate
of the interests of hjs fellow beings.
His public speeches, in which: he prom
ises so much to everybody but himself,
are calculated to benefit no ' one ' but hlm
self.' Â¦? In 1S96 he found the people of the
country in depressed circumstances and
told them that their deliverance. depended
solely upon the election of himself to the
Presidency and the Â¦ immediate free coin
age of silver at- the ratio of 16 to.l~.Thje
people rejected him and his money theory
and have since become prosperous. Now
Bryan would, if he could, abandon the
issue upon' which he made the campaign
of 1&&6. but his plans miscarried. The
Sioux Falls convention, by nominating a
candidate for the Vice Presidency against
the will of Bryan and his managers,
showed that the Populists were by no
means tractable. In order to satisfy
the Populists it was necessary for Bryan
to insist upon the reiteration of the 16 to
1 plank at Kansas City.
The free silver Issue Is a had one for the
Bryanites to handle this ytar, after the
country has recovered from the hard times
without having adopted the course Â¦which
In 1806 they declared would be the one
and only way to bring prosperity. So now
/f ** ONSIDERABLE attention is' "given in the
I Eastern States tcra recent table published by
The Engineer of London showing the relation
between the number of exhibits niade and the prizes
won in the machinery" and electrical departments of
the Paris Exposition by the 'people of the leading na
tions of the world. The showing has been a surprise
to us: We have always regarded 1 machinery as our
specialty. To be *ieieat'*d in art Work or in ; various
lines of industry requiring skill of the hand and brain
would not be unexpected by Vs, but we have deemed
ourselves easily superior to the rest of the nations in
the, invention and the management of mechanism.
In that expectation we Have been disappointed. In
stead of standing first among the pri^e-winners in
proportion to exhibitors, we stand very low in th^
list.
From a summary of the tables given by The En
gineer the Americans were awarded one grand, prize
or gold medal for every . 7.8 exhibits of machinery.
This is the worst result attained, for Switzerland
comes first, with only 0.58 of one entry for each grand
prize or gold medal. Next in order is Belgium, 1.6
entries; Germany, 1.8; Austria, 2.8; Russia, 3.2;
France, 3.8; Hungary, 4.7;* Great Britain, 4.6. In
electrical apparatus, too, the Americans stand last, the
comparative figures being: Austria, 1.1 entries for
each grand prize or gold medal; Germany, 1.3; Hun
gary, 1.8; Switzerland, 2.1; France, 2.5; Russiaj 3.4;,
Great Britain, 4.2; Belgium, 4.6; United States, 9.8.
Several explanations have been" offered to account
for the bad showing. One of them is to the effect
that political considerations must have had some in
fluence upon the minds of the judges,. the argument
being that Russia would never have been placed ahead
of the United States in machinery had there not been
a desire on the part of the French to please the Rus
sians. Other explanations are that- many of- the
American exhibits of machinery went down with the
steamer' Pauillac; that owing to the remoteness of the
exposition and the intense rush of business at home
we did not make as good an exhibit of machines as
we might have done. When due allowance is made
for all these factors, however, there will still remain
a good deal that needs explaining.
It is well known that conclusions drawn from per
centages are very apt to be deceptive. If we sent
twenty times jas much machinery as some rival coun
tries whose exhibitors sent only their very best, it is
quite natural that our percentage of awards should be
lower. Reports from Paris concerning other depart^
rnents of exhibits show results of that kind. Thus it has
been announced that Norway and Sweden surpassed
Italy in the percentage of prizes for dtcorative art.
No one will suppose that those countries have any
thing like the artistic industry of Italy, any more than
that the Russians are equal to the United States in
the manufacture of machinery. . Â¦
Should a full investigation of the subject be made
it will probably be found that a large number of
American exhibits of machinery were sent to the ex
position mainly for advertising purposes and that, it
was of all grades and kinds, so that while we had
much the best we had also a good 'deal ". that Was"
commonplace. Had the manufacturers of machinery
been as careful in preparing for the exposition as were
the winemakers of California they rwould doubtless
have fared as well as the winemakers did, despite the
handicap of the. labeling to w'tfich the French ob
jected. .' .."',/U- â¢â¢>

Aguinaldo, it is said, is preparing for a great coup.
Perhaps he has been reading, the signs ot the times
and is going to tell us in advance what will happen
to his friend from Nebraska on November 6.
It is a striking proof of the man's blind vanity that
in this very hour when his former followers are de
serting and condemning him in this city he goes forth
to stump the State as an aspirant for the United
State Senate. He is dreaming of higher honors even
v.hile his former friends are arranging to loot his
enmp and divide the spoils. Similar examples of
rocket reformers may be found in other cities, but the
annals of San Francisco furnish none. Phelan is the
first of the kind in this city, and the Democratic toast
13, "May we never have anot t iÂ»r."
Upon every issue that has arisen he has gone wrong
and has blundered in the -going. He has sacrificed
the municipality to the Democratic "push" and yet
he has offended the push itself. He has even alienated
the organ that in former days used to uphold him as
the model Mayor. From one end of the Democratic
camp to the other he is derided, mocked at, flouted
and denounced.
That the Democratic party is fickle has long been
known, but in this case the blameis not wholly upon
the party. Phelan in office has been a complete fail
ure. His promises of municipal improvement under
the new charter administered by him have proven to
be as futile as were Bryan's predictions of calamity in
1896. He has used all the powers of his office to build
himself up, and yet so incapable is he that everything
hf has done to advance his political fortunes has had
the opposite effect. Hardly anywhere can be found
such an example of a man making a political bank
ruptcy so completely and so quickly by the very
means he took to make his political fortune.
This year all is changed. Pnelan is utterly discred
ited. No pne admits himself to be a supporter of the
Phelan administration. No one asks for support be
cause he is or even was a friend of Phelan. It is all
the other way. Democracy as represented by its can
didates- is anything rather -than a Phelan party.
Every one of its candidates dodges Phelanism with
as much vigor as Bryan dodges the ice trust question.
One year ago Phelan held the Democratic conven
tion in the hollow of his hand; he virtually dictated
every nomination it made; he arranged the slate and
was chief party to even- deal and bargain that was
agreed upon in making it up. The nominees did not
disclaim his power. They boasted of it. They went
before the voters â¢ loudly proclaiming themselves
"Phelan/ s choice." They asked supporj upon "the
ground that Phelan had picked them out as men
whom he could rely upon to carry out his policies and
administer their offices according to his programme.
The people have notoriously short memories in
politics, and yet most San Francisco voters can re
ci.ll how eagerly every Democratic candidate last
year declared himself a Phelan man, how.' earnestly,
each of them insisted that his nomination had been
given to him because it was known he was a friend of
Phelan. They can therefore note the extent and com
pleteness of the change that has come over the Demo
cratic camp when they observe this year an equal
e^gerntss to repudiate Phelan and an equal earnest
re'ss in denying that he had any control of theforces
that nominated them.
THE PASSING OF PHELflN. ; ;; 3
â â â â¢ , . .
ONE of the significant features of the local cam
paign is. the change in the attitude' of the
Democratic stalwarts toward " Phelan. > One
year ago his name was potent enough to conjure with,
and every Democratic candidate. of that time used it
for that purpose. New the name of Phelan is a
hoodoo, and every Democratic candidate in this con
test is trying day and night to keep it from falling like
a blight upon his 'canvass.

FINANCE COMMITTEE
RESOLVES GORGEOUSLY
Declares for Miles of Repaying and
Hasn't Enough Money to
Build Short Sewer.
The finance committee of the Board of
Supervisors, with an . offhand liberality
that comes only about election time, when
sidetracked promises are generally, called
to mind,, yesterday adopted a resolution
favoring the expenditure of a fortune in
improving downtown streets and imme
diately thereafter resolved against the
building of a few hundred yards of sewer
in the Potrero because no money could
be located with which do the work.
The committee reported in â¢ favor of
Reed's resolution, pledging the board to
appropriate the sum of $100,000 out of tfie
excess revenues to repave accepted streets
in the downtown district. The resolution
declares it the- intention of the board to
remove all cobblestones in the district in
accordance with the pledges made before
election. According to the City Attorney's
opinion the money will not be available
until the beginning of the next fiscal year
and the resolution is simply a declaration
of intention to set It aside at that time.
The committee directed the Treasurer
to nie a list of all unreÂ«Â»1stered demands
paid during the month of July. This is a
preliminary step in the investigation de
manded by Supervisor McCarthy, whose
salary demand for June still remains un
paid, though It was registered.. The char
ter provides that registered demands shall
take precedence in payments by the
Treasurer.

She Was a Good Girl, but TJnkind

ency ' and Self-
Jturd'ex.
Miss Mildred Hinckley, the 16-year-old
school-girl who committed suicide in
Golden Gate Park last Monday by taking:
carbolic acid, was nagged and scolded to
death. ..
According to the testimony at the In
quest held by Coroner Colo yesterday the
poor girl was between two fires. She was
forced by- her mother, whose voice Is
clear and. sharp, to collect alimony of ?6
per week from her father, and in doing
so she endured the taunts and reproaches
of her father's relatives. Mildred had
been attending the Horace Mann' School,
and failed to pass the examination for
promotion last June. In order to avoid
the inevitable scolding she told her aunt
that she had been promoted. She brooded
over this, fearing detection, and over
other matters of family discord until. In
her helplessness and desperation, she de
stroyed herself. A constant attendant at
the Emmanuel Baptist Church, she took
great Interest In the Sunday-school and
in all other matters affecting the church,
and was in all respects a good, well
behaved girl.
Coroner Cole performed an act of laud
able justice when he announced that the
autopsy proved that the unfortunate girl
had led a pure life.
According to the mother's testimony
the father threatened that he would have
Mildred put in the Magdalen Asylum
because she had told her greataunt a
lie about her promotion. This threat
made the girl miserable and despondent.
She never Intimated to any of her girl
friends that she contemplated making
away with herself. On the contrary, she
always seemed to them cheerful and
happy.
Mildred's greataunt is Mrs. A. B.
Forbes of the corner of Sacramento and
Laguna streets. She was formerly Sallie
Hinckley, a popular actress, many years
ago. Mrs. Forbes had promised to send
Mildred to the Cogswell Polytechnic
School If she succeeded In getting pro
moted at the Horace Mann School, and It
was this, together with shame at her
failure and the fear of reproaches, that
induced Mildred to tell Mrs. Forbes a
falsehood.
The jury returned a verdict that de
spondency was the cause of the girl's
suicide.
Coroner Cole remarked that the next
Legislature should pass a law to prohibit
the indiscriminate sales of such cheap
and deadly poisons as carbolic acid except
upon the prescription of a reputable
physician. -

REWARD FOR BRAVERY
OF CAPTATN LEONARD
In a play of Shakespeare it Is usually
true that after a time some decisive step
if taken from which the action progresses
steadily toward its outcome, toward the
happy close of a comedy or the fatal close
of a tragedy. The progress of. the action
from Its climax to its close Is called the
resolution. Since It U the exact counter
part of the complication. It might with
some fitness bÂ« termed tne simplification.
At the end of a tragedy death settles all
strife; the close of a comedy Is marked
by explanations, forgiveness and general
happiness; and usually we are left listen
ing for the chime of marriage bells.
The incident which marks the beginning
of the resolution of thÂ« action has been
termed "the resolving force"; In the caw
of a tragedy It is often called more spe
cifically "the tragic force." All that Is
really necessary, howewr. is that the
These general statements will sometimes
need modification In order to fit the case
of a particular play. Some things that
have been paid, for example, do not apply
In the form given to "Othello." since In
this play the complication Is brought
about by the plot of lago. who Is the
enemy of Othello, and the hero is passive
during the flret half of the drama.
It is the rule in Shakespeare that this
exciting force, the ftr.-t important turn
ing point in the play. Is presented with
great distinctness. This helps the audi
ence to catch the exact point at issue.
Here, again. I think, we see th^ practical
wifdoro and ekill of the actor-dramatist.
For example, in "The Winter's Tale", the
leaious belief of Leorites In the guilt of
his wife and friend breakF forth so sud
denly that it eeemÂ« at first unmotlved and
Improbable: but Shakespeare shows us
afterward by many skillful touches and
glances backward that this suspicion and
Jealousy had really been growing u- grad
ually. Thus the exciting force is first pre
sented as something 3udden and distinct,
and is then shown to have ben brought
about gradually and naturally.
In a play the main contest. i<Â» central
Itruggle. Is between two parties â the hero
and those associated with him on the one
Side and hiÂ» opponent* on the other. The
various steps by which the hero and hii
party advance toward the accomplishment
of his great purpose up to the point where
the action begins to set clearly toward a
df-flrite outcome may together be. calJ-ed
the complication.
After the opening situation has been put
before us as fully asÂ» necessary a strong
<3e?ire or purpose springs up in the mind
of the hero or heroine or in if m.nds of
both. The struggle to accomplish this
purpose and the Â«->utoome of ti.e struggle
tnbke up the play Itself, a play Is a strug
gle, a contest. The incident which mark;
the beginning of the piay proper has been
called "the exciting force." This term Is
i translation of the one employed by the
German critic FrÂ»-ytagâ "Das erregende
Momer.t." The English phrase Is some
what misleadirig. If one were asked what
is the f-xoltir.g force in 'Macbeth" he
wou!d naturally reply, "AmbitionâMac
bet h> ambition." Bui this answer shows
a misunderstanding of the true meaning
cf the term. By the exciting force is
meant not the general motive or desire,
which is the mainspring of tae action of
the play, but rather the particular Inci
dent with which the movement of tha
drama actually begins. This lnciaent first
ihows us the nature of the conflict that
is to engage our attention; It often takes
the form of a temptation, plan or con
spiracy. The communication of the gbott
of Hamlet, the terapiing prophecies of
the weird PiFt^-rs to Macbeth, the plot of
lego against Othello and Desdemona. the
suggestion of Capsius that Brutus accept
the leadership in a conspiracy against
Car-par, the falling In love of Orlar.do and
Rosalind at the wrestling match in "As
You Like It." arc the exciting forces In
the five plays concerned.
In general, however, the introduction to
8 play of Shakespeare move? on so easily
and naturally lew reader? recognize that
only a master of stagecraft coujd com
pose it. We may f*>(-\ assured. I think,
that Bhakespeare. whose life was spent in
connection with the stage, who knew
with the intimate knowledge of an actor
just what was needed at this point in a
play, wrote thc-Ke skillful introduction*,
a.nd rot the great Lord Bacon.
about. Elsewhere in the play this banish
ment is looked upon as something that
happened long ago.
THE LATE JAMES HENRY
HACKETT AS JACK FAL
STAFF.
BY ALBERT 6. BOLLES, LL. D
In a previous article It was shown that
an employe could not recover from his
employer for an injury happening to him
through the negligence of a fellow-em
ploye, for the reason that he is regarded
as having assumed the risk himself. In
other words, an employer is not an insurer
against all accidents that happen to those
who are In his employ. When a man en
ters into the service of another he "takes
upon himself." so the courts have said,
"in consideration of the compensation to
be paid him, the ordinary risks of the em
ployment, including the negligence of his
tellow-laborers." In another case the
court remarked that "the rule rested upon
the sound principle that each one who en
ters upon the service of another takes on
himself all the ordinary risks of the em
ployment in which he engages, and that
the* negligent acts of his fellow-workmen
in the general course of his employment
are witnin the ordinary risks." And on
another occasion the same court re
marKed: "If the risk is an ordinary one the
eraplover is not liable even if the employe
did use ordinary care. In all such cases
the risk of injury is one of the hazards
which the employe assumes when fie en
gages in the service to which it is lnci
aent. This has always been the law.
The courts have often said that the em
ploye receives higher wages than he
would have been paid had his employer
insured him against all accidents. This
statement can neither be proved nor de
nied. It may be true; it may not be. Per
haps if the employer had been held liable
In all cases. Instead of giving lower wages,
he would have been more careful in select
ing persons for his employment.
It mav be that if the employers were al
wavs held liable they would seek to ex
empt themselves from liability by a spe
cial contract with their employes. Per
haps they would have been required py
their employers to give up all claims aris
ing from accident, and if they had, the
question may be asked: Would such a
contract be legal? It is contrary to the
policy of the law for any one to relieve
himself from liability arising from his
negligence, and why should not this rule
applv to an employer as well as to a rail
road' company. This, however, is not a
uniform rule in all the States, and the
tendency of the courts Is to permit greater
freedom in this direction.
Can an Employer Escape Liability
by Contract ?
The Rule in Virginia.
In Alabama a railroad company made a
rule that the compensation paid to its em
ployes should cover all risks and that no
claim for anv compensation for an injury
would be paid. The -court declared that
the companv went too far and had no
right to make such a rule. In another
case arising In the same State a railroad
company had raaikJi similar rule, declar
ing that all persoÂ»*ln the service of the
company in accepting or retaining em
ployment were regarding as assuming the
ordinary risks attending the service. Each
employe was expected and required to
look a'fter his own safety and to exercise
the utmost caution to avoid injury to his
fellows, especially In switching cars and
moving trains. The court said that rail
roads, like other corporations and persons,
had the right to adopt reasonable rules
and regulations for governing their em
ployes and for their own protection, but
could not relieve themselves from liability
for their own wrongful negligence.
An interesting; case in which this was
the principal question arose in Virginia.
A- railroad company made a contract with
a firm to remove a granite bluff and it
was agreed that the company should In no
way be held responsible for any Injury to
any of the members of the firm or its em
ployes caused by the removal of the
qua"rry. During the progress of the work
one of the members of the llrm was killed
by the negligence, so it was claimed, of
the company. It sought to shield itself
behind the contract above mentioned. But
the court would not permit this. "To up
hold the stipulation would be to hold that
it was competent for one party to put the
other party to the contract at the mercy
of its own misconduct, which can never
be done where an enlightened system of
Jurisprudence prevails. Public policy for
bids it. and contracts against public policy
are void. Nothing is better settled in this
court than that a common carrier cannot,
by contract, exempt himself for responsi
bility for his own or his servants' negli
gence in th(j carrying of goods or passen
gers." . . . : : H--v
The Rule in Georgia.
On the other hand, in Georgia a differ
ent rule has been declared. An employer
may by express contract relieve himself
from all liability for negligence except
such as may be of a criminal nature. This
was decided in a case in which an em
ploye made a contract reading thus: "He
further agrees that he will take upon
himself all risks connected with or inci
dent to the employment, and will in no
case hold the company liable for any in-
Jury or damage, to his person or other
wise, he may sustain while thus employed,
whether It arises from explosion, or the
machinery, or accident, or the negligence
or misconduct of himself or any other
person employed by the company, or from
any other cause." This contract was held
to "be good, and consequently deprived the
employe, who was one of the parties
thereto, of all right to recover for any in
jury happening to him through the negli
gence of the company.
The Rule in Arkansas
Another case may be mentioned that
came before the Supreme Court of Ar
kansas. The terms of the contract were
quite similar to those In the case last
mentioned. The court said that a com
mon carrier "could not pre-contract with
its customers" so as to relieve Itself from
its own negligent acts, but that the con
tract in question was of a different na
ture, as the relation between the parties
was essentially a private one. that of
master and servant. "The negligence of
a fellow-servant is not in fact and In
morals the negligence of the master,
hence a stipulaton not to be answerable
for their negligence beyond the selection
of competent servants in the first Instance
and the discharge of such as prove to be
reckless or Incompetent might be held to
be reasonable." Nevertheless, as It was
the duty of employers to furnish reason
ably safe appliances and places to worK
for their servants' use, and this duty was
one of public interest, the court concluded
by holding that the company could not
relieve itself from this duty by contract
in advance.
The Rule in New York.
Lastly may be mentioned the answer
given to this question by the highest
court In New York. An employe of a rail
road company released it from any liabil
ity for Injun' to him growing out of its
negligence or that of its agents or em
ployes. The consideration for giving the
release was employment and the compen
sation therefor. Yet the court held that
there was no consideration or cause for
the release, and consequently that it was
void. The court added: "We do not in
timate that if the railroad company had
given some kind of consideration it would
have been valid. If might even then be
urged that public policy Sprbids the en
actment of such contracts." And tnls
seems to be the more general opinion.
An employe assumes the risk attending
his employment by contract. The law de
clares he knows what he is doing. It Is
true he does not say a word about the
risk, but the law says this for him. "The
Immunity of the master." says . the Su
preme, Court of New Jersey, "rests upon
the contract of hiring and not upon the
absence or presence of negligence in
either party. The master says to the
servant: 'You understand fully the na
ture of the employment and the danger
attending It: will you enter upon it?' Tie
servant says: ; 'I will accept it.' And the
law Implies that he accepts It with all the
risk Incident to It, without regard to the
magnitude of the dangers."
â¢ An employe must use ordinary care to
avoid Injuries to himself. "He is under as
great obligations." so the Supreme Court
of Indiana has remarked, "to provide for
his own safety from such dangers as are
known to him, or discoverable by the ex
ercise of ordinary care on his part, as
the master Is to provide It for him." In
a case arising from an Injury to a person
working in a sftwmill the court said that
he was under no obligation when;begin

mill first and make himself familiar with
each piece of machinery and' the 'danger

University of Chicago.
The reader must not suppose for a mo
ment that three divisions of the action
are as distinct and separate as I have
made them seem In my discussion.
Shakespeare skillfully prepares his read
ers for every Important development that
is to come. Though we. may be somewhat
surprised now and then at the exact turn
which the action takes, yet in the case of
an attentive spectator or reader the great
dramatist appeals much more to expecta
tion than to surprise.
A few words of warning must be given
before I close this subject. Shakespeare
frequently has several more or less fully
developed actions, or stories, in the same
play, especially in his comedies. In such
a play it is only the main action of which
I am speaking. For example. "As You
Like It contains half a dozen different
stories; but I have referred in my division
of the play only to the principal one â the
love story of Orlando and Rosalind.
action of a drama Into introduction, com
pilation anÂ«l resolution which has been
discussed. The point A marks the loca
tion of the exciting force. B denotes the
turn of the actionâ the resolving actionâ if
any single incident seems to deserve that
title.
We commonly speak of the closing part
of the resolution of a tragedy as the ca
tastrophe; in the case of a comedy we call
the last portion simply the close or the
conclusion. In a similar way the last part
of the complication, just preceding the
turn or resolving force, is sometimes
called the climax of the play. This term
is not a fortunate one, since the word
"climax" Is often understood to mean
simply the incident which begins the reso
lutionâthe resolving force. Perhaps we
may call that portion of a drama just
preceding the turn of the action the mid
dle of the play, whenever it is helpful or
convenient to designate it by a separate
name. The term is colorless, but Is at
least free from misleading suggestions.
"Julius Caesar" Is a play that can be di
vided with some fitness into the five
divisions just Indicated. The artful
tempting of Brutus by Casslus marks the
close of the Introduction and the begin
ning of the complication; the death of
Caesar would begin the middle of the ac
tion or climax; the speech of Antony to
the Roman populace starts the resolution,
and the appearance to Brutus of the
ghost of Caesar may fairly be taken as
the beginning of the catastrophe. The
threefold division indicated by the above
figure, however, is the one of fundamental
importance.
The word "climax" is often employed
in dramatic criticism in still a third mean
ing, and since the term Is much used I
feel that I 6hall be doing my readers a
service If I call attention to this. The
point of greatest emotional intensity in a
play Is sometimes called the climax, and
very naturally: but this point may not
fall at or near the turn of the action. In
"Othello," for example, our interest cn
stantly increases up to the tremendous
catastrophe. In this third meaning of
the word, therefore, the climax of
"Othello" comes at the close of the play.
it. It was sufficient for him when enter
ing upon the active discharge of the
duties assigned to him to ascertain what
he was expected to do and the dangers
directly connected therewith, and he had
a right to assume that in the performance
of that particular dutyÂ» reasonable facil
ities therefor would be "afforded him with
out coming in contact with other unfore
seen or unsuspected dangers. Such is
the general rule, often repeated with
slight variations as the particular case
seemed toÂ« require. It Is quite impossible
to state this duty or requirements of em
playes in precise words, for the situation
is so varying. That ho must exercise or
dinary care in executing his employment
is a universal rule.
What Risks Are Assumed P
If an employe is doing hazardous worn
he is required to use the utmost caution
to avoid danger, and if he docs not and is
Injured he has no right to recover any
thing from his employer. The hazard of
working in a mine is greater than ihat of
working on a farm or in a cotton factory.
An employe therefore assumes the hazard
of the ordinary perils attending his em
ployment; whatever they may be. Says
Justice Sherwood of the Supreme Court
of Missouri: "Whatever hazards are
concomitant of the employment the em
ploye assumes necessarllv Tvhen engaging
in the performance of the 'lutles pertain
ing thereto." But the dangers, as every
one knows, vary from almost none to the
gravest. They are many in kind and de
gree. When, therefore, we have saad thÂ»U
the care to be used must b% measured by
the danger we can say np more. In a
given case the question arises, Did the
injured person exercise all the care the
law required?- This is a fact to be ascer
tained in the same manner as facts are
in other cases.
A legal author whose words have been
adopted by the Supreme Court of Mis
souri thus states the duty of an employe
wh.Ie engaged in his work: "It is his
duty to go about his work with his eyes
open. He may not wait to be told, but
must act. He must take ordinary care to
learn the dangers which are likely to be
set him in the service. If the master pro
vides written or printed instructions or
warning It Is his duty to rrad them. He
must not go blindly and heedlessly to hiB
work when there is danger. He must in
form himself. This Is the law every
where. The servant is he?d by his con
tract of hiring to assume Â»he risk of In
jury from the ordinary dangers of the
employment: that 13 to Bay. from such
dangers as are known to him or dlscov
erable by the exercise of ordinary care on
his part. He has, therefore, no right of
action In general against his master for
an injury befalling him from such a cause.
His right to recover will depend upon his
knowledge or ignorance of the danger. If
he knew of it or was under a legal obli
gation to know of it. it was a part of his
contract and he cannot in general re
cover."
This principle has been carried very far.
Thus when persons have been injured at
work on a railroad from the lack of a
flagman to give notice of the coming of
trains the courts have often declared that
unless there was a statute law requiring a
company to have one they would .not hoM
this to be one of its duties. An accident
might be prevented if a flagman were em
ployed, but if men engaged in labor,
knowing there were no flagman, they as
sumed the risk.
Another application cf the same princi
ple may be made to an Injury happening
from exposed machinery. If it were boxed
the Injury would not have happened, but
the using of It In an exposed manner is
not regarded by the law as negligence if
those- who were operating it knew or
ought to have known of the danger. Thus
in Coombs vs. New Bedford Cordage Com
pany Justice Hoar remarked that it
could not be doubted "that it is the legal
right, of every person to carry on a busi
ness which is dangerous, either in Itself
or In his manner of conducting It, if it is
not unlawful and interferes with no right
of other persons." In such a case if a
person is injured a jury cannot say as a
fact that the employer is negligent in not
protecting employes from danger by
guarding It, though the evidence may
clearly show that the accident would not
have happened had it been guarded, for
the reason that the danger, however great,
if It was known or might have been
known by ordinary observation, Is as
sumed by the employe.

In a play. ju*t as in a voyage, th" first
thing necessary Js that we know our lati
tude and longitude. "Where are we?" is
the first question. Shakespeare shows

Â¦we need to know about the situation in

giving u? this information the persons be

anothT. and their conversation sterns,

W> may call this opening portion of the
play the introduction: the struggle which
make* up the play proper has not yet be
f^;n.
It if an exceedirgly difficult matter to
xr.arage th'.a Introduction naturally, and
em Shakefpeare sometimes falls short of
complete success. For example, near the
beginnir.cr of "Hamlet" Horatio explains
to hi? comrade* In a long speech the rea
finr.s for the military preparations that
are being made by the Danes. He thus
xr.akes the situation clear to the audience,
but la doing so he recounts very fully to
MÂ£r<-Â«Â»nus and Bernardo much tr = t must
be already perfectly well known to them.

life that he should explain to them In de

man. It is natural for an angry man
to "recount his grievances, and In this way
Boderigo and Orlando tell uÂ» much about
their history and present circumstances
Trithout any violation of probability.
"Much Ado About Nothing" begins with a
messenger's report of the result of a bat
tle, and with the meeting of acquaint
er.res who have been separated for a time.
B'-'ause of these circumstances the refer
ences to the past are entirely natural,
Â¦while at the same tim*Â» the audience is
made to understand the situation. The
f.rst part Â°f th -<? conversation between
Charles and Oliver in th." first seen* of
"As You Like It" is awkward in several
ways. Char>s telin Oliver in great detail
what he rails "'ild newt;": all of this,
therefore, must be already known to Oli
ver. In <^rder to make this conversation
teem as natural as possible it is assumed
that the banishment of tie old Duke is
somewhat recentâ is still being talked
RT ALBERT H. TOLLMAN
It is hardly practicable In "As You Like
It" to insist on finding any very distinct
resolving force. When ShaJiespeare brings
Orlando and Rosalind into the same for
est we see what is going to come of it;
this becomes plainer when they actually
meet: and when Rosalind, professing to
be a boy, Ganymede, arranges that Orlan
do shall practice wooing her, the sup
posed boy. as if Rosalind were really
present, we see the quick-witted heroine
grasp the rudder, and we feel confident
that, she will bring her craft Into the de
sired haven.
The following figure will represent in a
general way the threefold division of the
course of the action shall swing around
from Increasing complication toward in
creasing simplification, toward a definite
outcome; it is not necessary that this
"turn" of the action shall be made man
ifest in one specific incident, or resolving
force.
The resolving force in "Julius Caesar Is
the speech of Antony to. the populace: in
"Othello" It is the wonderful third scent
of act three, in which lago artfully con
vinces Othello of the guilt of Desdemona.
I consider the killing of Polonius to be ths
resolving force in "Hamlet," though some
would find it in the failure of Hamlet to
kill the King when he comes upon the
monarch engaged in prayer. In "Mac
beth" it seems to me that the tragic
forxe. the beginning of the falling action.
is the escape of Fleance Jn the third scene
of act three. At this point, for the first
time. Macbeth strives to prevent the ful
fillment of a solemn prediction of the
weird sisters and Is defeated. Some look
upon the appearance to Macbeth of the
Rhost of Banquo. in the fourth scene of
the same act. as the resolving force; buL
these two opinions are not so different as
they may Â«e<-m. The first incident seems
to mark the real turn in the course of the
action; but the scene witn lianquo's ghost
shows us for the first time Lhat the spirii
of Macbeth is beginning to give way. Per
haps we may call the tirst incident the
outward and the second the inward
"turn" of the action.

IV. How to Multiply Easy Numbers.
This lesson has been arranged specially
for office boys. It presents a few very in
teresting short-cuts In multiplication.

Notice that the right hand flgnres. 3 and
7, add to 10, and the left-hand figures. 6
and 8. ar* the fame. To find the product
we say 7 times :> are 21 and put down both
figures; add I to 6. making 7. and say 7
times 6 are 42. and put down both figures.
This rule applies in all numbers of two
figures each where the rirht-har.d figures
add to 10 and the ieft->iand figures are- the
same. Try the following- exercises:
24X25 .62X68
27 X 23 64 X 6Â«
32 X 3S 65 X 65
84 X S6 92 X 9S
45 X 45 73 X 77
51 X 59 81 X 89
52 X 58 84 X 86
Notfrr-In the exercise 51 X 59 it Is neces
sary to add a cipher. For instance. Â» times
1 must give 09. Instead of simply 9.
2. Multiply 294 by 296.

This is the same rule applied to numbers
of three figrures. We say 6 times 4 are 24.
and put down both figures; now, if we add
1 to 29 we have 20. and 30 times 29 Is S70.
Apply this rule to the following exercises:

making 332; 43 X 11 = 473; add the 4 and 3
and place the sura between the 4 and 3. To
multiply 3243 by 11. proceed as follows:

say 3 and 4 are 7; then 4 and 2 are 6; thon
2 and 3 are 5; then put down the left-hand
figure 3. and we have the product
4. Multiply 98 by 94.

The complement of a number is the dif
ference between It and the unit of the next
highest order; thus, 2 is the complement
of 9S: 6 Is the complement of 94: 7 is the
complement of 92; 13 is the complement of
l>87. To multiply these two numbers mul
tiply the complements 2 and 6 and p'ace
the product. 12, in the answer. For the
remaining two figures subtract across,
either the 6 from the OS or the 2 from the
94, leaving 92. Apply this rule to the fol
lowing examples:

Tou remember how they fretted the autumn
air and annoyed the American laborer at hU
work and disturbed his well-earned sleep at
night by their loud clamor and senseless agita
tion for free and unlimited coinage of silver
at the so-called "'eternal and eacred" ratio of
16 to 1, and robbed that laborer of his time
by pouring Into his ear dark prophecies of evil
days to come, dire portents of fast-approach
ing disaster, sad tales of industrial wreck and
ruinâof less work and lower wages, of in
dividual bankruptcy and government deficits.

Tou remember how they predicted ruin, bank
ruptcy and misery to the people, to all sections
alike, because of the Dingley tariff, which they
violently opposed and which they foretold
would be a burden on industry and a source
of commercial disaster. We passed and lmvÂ«
administered the Dingley tariff and It haa been
not only a copious and unfailing fountain of
unmixed blessings to all the people, but has
furnished ample funds to discharge the or

the extraordinary and uncertain coat of carry

incident to crushing an Insurrection Inspired.

"But one single Instance of outrage has oc
curred, and that at the extremetles of the
world, and by a piratical horde, amenable to
no 'law but the law of force. The Malays of
Sumatra committed a robbery and massacre
upon an American vessel. Wretches' They did
not then know that Andrew Jackson was Pres
ident of the United States, and that no dis
tance, no time, no idle ceremonial of treat
ir.i with robbers and assassins was to hold
back the arm of Justice. Commodore Downes
went out. His cannon and his bayonets struck
the outlaws in their den. They paid In terror
and In blood for the outrage which was com
mitted, and the great lesson was taught to
these distant pirates â to our antipodes them
selves â that not even .the entire diameter of
the globe could protect them, and that the
name of the American citizen, like that of
Roman citizen In the great da.yÂ§ of the repub
lic and of the empire, was to be the Inviolable
passport of all that wore It throughout the
But Jackson was denounced as a "tyrant,
despot, usurper, destroyer of the liberties of his
country," seeking to overthrow the republic
and to erect an empire on its ruins. For leap-
Ing to the defense of American citizens abroad
he was charged with treasonably undermining
the constitution. The air wm full of Intemper
ate attacks on his patriotism. Speaking of his
watchfulness and aggressive Americanism,
Benton says â and I quote him for tbe benefit of
all who are just now hampering the admin
istration and discouraging American soldiers:
If the Democratic declalmers In California
and elsewhere have acquired the habit of read
ing history and chance to have the speeches
of Thomas H. Benton In their single tax and
free trade libraries, I commend them to a
perusal of his masterly defense of Andrew
Jackson, delivered in the United States
Senate. To be sure modern Democracy has
turned its back on the teachings of Jackson,
but it may be timely to recall that in his day
and generation he stood for national supremacy
and the protection of American citizens where
soever they might be on a lawful errand.
The American people have heard this cry be
fore. It has not even the merit of originality;
It smells -of the grave wherein lie buried and
almost forgotten the dead Issues of the pant.
They were nauseated by It when Jackson was
President. They listened to and scorned It
when Lincoln, In 1864, was making* the su
preme effort to crush rebellion. Farther back,
even the father of his country was charged
with â¢'imperialistic" tendencies and aiming at
monarchy.
But now they tell us that "militarism," "im
rerlallsm" is the isBue, the paramount issue.
How they love that word! A change has come
over the spirit of their dreams. They now deem
it politic to conceal their purpose of disarrang
ing and debasing our currency, of packing the
Supreme Court of the United States, of sus
taining the solid Democratic South in Its at
tempted nullification* of the fourteenth and
fifteenth amendments, of striking down protec
tion to American shops and farms, and they
turn to do battle with a creature of their heat
ed and distempered imaginationâ "militarism,"
"Imi- rlalism." There is no such issue. In

issue, a false Issue. To borrow their beloved
word, it Is a paramount humbug 1

SAMUEL. M. SHORTRIDGE, THE TIRELESS REPUBLICAN CAM
PAIGNER. ADDRESSING ONE OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL
MEETING OF THE CAMPAIGN AT METROPOLITAN' TEMPLE.
The question Is whether we desire to follow
the strange banner of the prophet or the stars
and stripes as held alcft by tbe peerless states
man. William McKinley. Life is a practical
thing: government Is a practical thing. ThÂ«
Koiublkan party claims to be the friend of
lab?r, and I want to say that in this country
there ie but one kingâ labor. In this country
there is and can be but one constitution; there
is and can be only one fias; there is only****
<iÂ«-siiny awaiting this country. That party
vt.'.ch gives labor to all, that awakeni the
music of Industry, if the friend of labor.

A SIGHT of the ordinary San Francisco delegation to the State Legisla
ture is not calculated to Inspire in the mind of the beholder any
great degree of respect for the intelligence and discrimination of the
voters of this city. The districts controlled by Kelly and Crimmlns
generally send a sorry assortment of statesmen to Sacramento.
Some of them entertain peculiar notions of honesty. Two years agro one of
the Kelly brand of statesmen declared that a brother Assemblymanâ Dibble
of the Forty-flrfct â was not an honest man. He ttaid: "Dibble told us that
there was ISOO in a bill that was up for passage, axd we found out afterward
that there was" $1000."
In the election which takes place November 8 the citizens of the) Twenty
eighth Assembly district ought to vote for Eusrene F. Lacy. He was born
in San Francisco and was educated in the public schools of the city. He has
been In the service of tho Wells, Fargro & Co. express since 1S8S. He was
elected to the Assembly in 18%. .receiving 400 majority. He made a rood
record, serving with credit to his constituents and himself. At the request of
labor unions he Introduced and secured the passage of the bill making the
date of the State Labor day correspond with the date of tho national Labor
day.
Mr. Lacy is well and favorably known in fraternal and secret organiza
tions. He declined a nomination for the Assembly In 1898, but accepted this
year, receiving the nomination of the Democratic convention and the Citi
zen's Republican party.
About all that can be said of Charles R. Franklin, his opponent. Is
that he was nominated by Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmlns. If elected, he
would not consider himself under obligations to serve the people of the
Twenty-eighth Assembly district. He would not look to them for guidance
or instruction, but on the contrary would consult the bosses and vote for
such bills as Martin Kelly would recommend, and vote against measures
that Kelly could not commend. A vote for Franklin la a vote for the low
est type of bosses.

"The Union â it must and shall be preserved."
and crushed incipient nullification in South
Carolina?
The False Alarmists.
Let the Democratic false alarmists Btand by
the grave of Jackson and prate of "Imperial
ism" if they dare. Why. sir, if that rugged
patriot could rise from his sleep he would blast
these lilliputians with one glanceâ his indigna
tion would silence them forever.
Â¦ Was Abraham Lincoln an "imperialist" when
he struck secession down and lifted man upâ
when he saved the Union for you, for me, for
all who are heavy-burdened and thrist for lib
erty under law?
Was General Grant an "imperialist" when.
Laying aside his unconquerable sword, he said:
"Let us have peace?"
Was William McKinley an "Imperialist"
when, after diplomacy had failed, he approved
the declaration of war against Spainâ a war as
righteous as it was glorious? Is he an "Im
perialist" now, when. In the discharge of his
high constitutional duties and in obedience to
an oath registered in heaven, he Is enforcing
the supreme laws of the land? 'Â¦
What is this thing they call "imperialism?"
Is growth "imperialism?" If so, what en
thusiastic and aggressive "Imperialists" we
have been from Jamestown and Plymouth to
this very bourt Is expanding territory- "Im
perialism?" If so, how we have offended!
Was the Louisiana purchase due to Jeffer
son's "imperialism?" If so, then let us re
store it to France.
Was Florida acquired by reason of Monroe's
devotion to "imperialism?" If so, give it back
to Bpaln.
Was Texas the offspring of this monster "Im
perialism?" If so, cede it to Mexico, or set it
adrift as an lndepedent nation.
Is California, crowned with her fifty years
end celebrating- her golden Jubilee, a mis
shapen child of "Imperialism?" Were the
plcneers a gang of marauders? Are the Na
tive Sons of sterling manhood, the Native
Daughters of queenly beauty the descendants
of "lmperiaJlstie" freebooters? If so, pull
down the Stars and Stripes from the dome of
our Capitol and tell Governor Gage to give
vray to en heir of Montezuma,
Hearts Go With the Flag.
But the Democrats say all this territory
Â¦was "contiguous." That is a favorite word In
their vocabulary, almost equally so with
"paramount." How about Alaska? That was
rot contiguous. At every step of our progress
there have been timid men who have been.
alarmed at our national expansion. 'When
our soldiers and sailors are grappling- with an
other problem there are those to lend encour
agement to their enemies.
I The hearts of the American people follow the
flag and no Agulnaldo will ever be able to tear
it from the skies. No Democratic President
will ever be permitted to haul It down.
In this hour let us stand for the liar, let
us stand for our own Interests and tbe honor
and dignity of the flag. We have gone for
ward until we are in the forefront of the na
tions of the earth. Let me tell you. this na
tion does not intend to forsake the teachings
of the forefathers. We propose that the flag
thall stand for liberty, not oppression; for Jus
tice, not Injustice; for civilization, not bar
barism."
â¢ Let us resolve that the nation's progress
shall not be checked, its honor assaulted.
Oh, my friends, those false lights you see will
be put out, those rocks will be avoided and
vnder the guidance of the Republican party our
nation shall go forward to a more splendid

CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â Liquidation by discour
aged longs, influenced mostly by a lUd drop at
Liverpool, ruled In the wheat pit throughout
the session. The heavy movement, favorable
weather and a slow cash demand added to the
bull demoralization. Some export business was
accomplished at the decline, but there was
not enough of it to check the bull rout. The
increase in the world visible, 2.156.000 bushels,
although under expectations, also failed to ma
terially affect the price. The selling was gen
eral, the demand local and scattered and little
calculated to withstand the heavy lines which
came- Into the pit through commission houses.

Corn held remarkably steady In view of the
wheat weakness, better weather, liquidation by

The oats market felt the bearlshness o( other
grains. Buslnerp - showed little activity. De
cember closed \4c lower at 21%@22c.
Provisions were weak at the opening because

Northwest by the shortage of the spring wheat
crop had been greatly overstated. The state
ment of the Northern Pacific for the second
â¢a-f-rk in October Bhows a decrease In gross
earnings of ?17,<r>3. notwithstanding additional
mileage cornered with last year of nearly 400
miles. There was a notable disinclination in
the rfst fi the market to respond to this move
ment and the r^coverie* were quite Insignifi
cant. The fa!! In the call loan rate to Z^. per
cer.t in the laM half-hour was equally without
rffÂ»>ct In reawakening speculation and the
ir.iirket closed lrrcrular at some net chanres
The earlier fialfs for call loans ruled from 4H
to C per cent Â«nd Jt ie not unlikely that the re
action rÂ«j due to the abstinence of the specu
lator* from further encroachment on money
rofources. The events of the day had the ef
fort of awakening some fr*>sh uneasiness over
thÂ» market conditions and these were not al
topether allayed by the renewed weaknecs of
exchange, especially Paris cheques. - The trans
fer of currency to New Orleans through the
*urtreÂ«sury was also renewed to-day. A doubt
exists regarding the effectiveness of hirh coal
loan rate* In renewing gold Imports. The gold
thus far secured was the result of scouring the
cpen market eur>j>ljÂ«Â»Â« over Europe, without
arousing the opposition of the *Teat central
barking Institutions which would have to be
fponxors for any considerable pold supply
Buyers of tlmÂ» money show a disinclination
to pay as much as five pÂ»r cent, while bank
ers have counted upon a jrood market for time
loans at C per cent. Whether they will 1*. in
clined to Import gold under the circumstances
to meet the exigencies of cpeculatlpn Is a
mooted <ju<Â»rtion. * -

Weather Report.
The report of A. O. McAdie. section director
cf the California section of the climate and
crop service of the Weather Bureau, for the
paÂ»t week is as follows:
"Nearly normal weather conditions have pre
vailed during the week, with considerable
cloudiness and rain in most places. *.n the
northern part of the State the rainfall has
been sufficient to still further improve the con
dition of the soil and to (rive more life and
rapid growth to *rree-n feed and early sown
grain; In the southern partton the precipitation
was too lipht to be of material benefit, except
in a few favored localities. No serious dam
a** was done to raisins and fruit still on the
trarÂ«. aÂ« timely warning* had been given. A
heavy rain at this time would be very bene
ficial jn all sections.
'The raifin and fruit crops are now mostly
cured and under shelter. Raisins are eaid to
be cf superior quality in all eections, and in
nomr vineyards the yield is about average,
while In ether-? it f&Ilf considerably below;
considering quality and the large yield in many
places. It is believed the crop will compare
favorably with most seasons. The yield of
deciduous fruit. pftwdMy excepting prunes. Is
Â¦ hove the average in all sections north of the
TÂ«-hachapl. and the quality is excellent. In
many orchards prunes have yielded average
crops, and the fruit is of good size, while in
others the yield has b*>en comparatively light
and the fruit Email. Oranges are maturing
earlier than usual in most places and give
promts* of a heavy crop; It is reported that
the early Porterville oranges will be ready for
shipment about November 1. Olives are ripen
ing and pickling has commenced in some
places. Walnut picklrg Is progressing.
"Early eown grain is up and looking well in
portions of the Sacramento Valley. In some
localities new press haa started sufficiently for
grazing, and pasturage will be abundant in a
few weeks. Alfalfa Is doing well. Summer
lallow seeding is nearly completed in some
wotions and progressing rapidly in others. Re
ports from all sections indicate that an unusu
ally larjre acreage of grain Is contemplated for
the coining neason."

London was engaged In taking profits pre

For the brutal treatment of his wife
and' three small children John Thompson
of Emeryville was sentenced to six
months in the county jail by Justice
James G. Quinn to-day. The sentence Is
the full extent of the law. and In lmpos T
ing it the Justice remarked that he felt
no sympathy for any man of Thompson's
Ilk, and regretted that the law did not
allow him greater latitude.
"You are. entitled' to no leniency what
ever, Thompson," said the court. "I have
no sympathy with a man who would beat
his wife, and I will therefore Impose upon
you the full extent of the law-^slx month3
in the County Jail. Thalis all I can give
you for the ' crime with which you are
charged, and I only regret that there is
no way in which" the proper punishment
can be meted out to you. It has; .been
shown that you have been most cruel to
your wife and children and have -' not
shown them the consideration that a hus

Thompson, who resides at Forty-seventh
and Adeline streets, just on the boundary
line between this city and Emeryville,

on account of his neglect and abuse of

shortly before the shooting Smith left the
buggy and Stearns, taking his gun to go
into the brush near the road to search
for game. He was about fifty feet away
when he heard ' a shot. The explosion
frightened the horse, and Lemmon, who
was close by,' ran to the team and as
sisted in stopping the runaway. Stearns
was Â¦ dead before Smith' started home. Â¦
The accident was peculiarly distressing
because Stearns was the only support of
his mother. His father died a month ago
Stearns was a- native of Michigan. He

The subject has attracted attention be
cause of the recent action of the Board
of Health in recommending the removal
from the schools of teachers and pupils
who may be afflicted with tuberculosis.
Can contagion be carried by a plain,
ordinary school lead pencil 7 That Is the
question which has been thrown at the
Board of Education for Fettlement, and
all because, the discovery has been made
that little children in the lower grades of
the public schools are allowed to use
their pencils Indiscriminately.
The practice of school children putting
their pencils intheir mouths to facilitate,
presumably, the mental processes, is. said
to be the prime cause ,of the difficulty:
These pencils are collected and then given
out the next day Indiscriminately. Now
the suggestion has been made that there
is a grave danger of spread of contagious
diseases by means of these same* pencils.
In a few cases teachers were"~found who
realized the sanitary aspect of the sit
uation, and they made the collection In
such a manner that the pencils were given
out to the. original holders.

subject of water rates had been brought
up while Mott end Woodward were talk
ing, and that the Councilman had said tho
cut was kind of heavy but that it would
have to go, as there were votea enough
In the Council to pass It.
"Woodward told Dingee about the con
versation with Mott." said Watson, "anl
later "Woodward spoke about us makine
an affidavit. . Subsequently WooÂ«". ward
wrote out a memorandum of the conver
sation, which I read."
Judge Hart this morning permitted tho
city's amendments relating to the tltlo
to the Contra Costa Water Company'^
plant to stand. The amending allegation
that covered President Watklnson s al
leged statement. 1 *, to the sufficiency of tho
old plant to supply water were not al
lowed.
Councilman H. D. Rowe was further
examined and when he had finished an
swerlng the water company's representa
tives the counsel for the city were aghast.
Rowe testified in response to McCuteh
en's quiet queries that President .Wat
kinson had not admitted that the old
Contra Costa Water Company's plant was
sufficient, but that he had said if the Oak
land Water Company had not been sup
plying patrons In Oakland the San Lean
dro Lake would have run dry.
Rowe admitted that Ms published inter
view expressed his view* and he. like his
successor. Councilman Schaffer, had no
explanations to make about their Inter*
views.
Rowe also asserted that he did not
know whe*re the report came from upon
which â¢ the Fire and Water Committed
had acted in fixing the rate schedule. Ho
asserted that the Council had only taken
as testimony the stenographic reports of
statements made by President Watklnscn
and by the late J. C- Martin.
Schaffer was examined at length and
gave the following reason for voting af
firmatively on the rates: "I did not UkÂ«
to subject myself to newspaper criticism
nor appear ! as opposed to cutting rate*.
There werÂ« enough Coundlraen -to pass
the ordinance and I did not like to stand
out when I could accomplish nothing."

Judge Hart was wearied by the slow
progress of thÂ» case this afternoon. At

"Nine o'clock!" ejaculated Mr. Mc-
Cutchon. in surprise.
"Can't you make it 9:30?" pleaded tha
barrister.
"I think not," was his Honor's senten
tious reply, as he made his way off the
bench to get rid of the expostulants.
"Nine o'clock!" sighed McCutchon.

But since th^n other financial troubles
have come upot: the Meyer electric light
plant. The Santa Rosa Bank attached it
for $5000, and (after keeping a receiver In
charge for two months finally abandoned
the fight. Other attachments have been
added for electrical supplies, for the lum
ber in the building an-1 the poles, and
finally for the engine that isÂ» used in run
ning the plant. A cargo of coal for the
works was attached under one of the
Mendenhall claims.
When the Livermore Water and Power
Company, controlled by William J. Din
gee, established itself in Llvermore and
erected an electric light plant Meyer en
tered into a direct fight with the new com
pany. Knowing that the establishment of
the new electric light plant would Injure
his ga* plant Meyer tried to sell to Din
gee, and when no terms could be made he
erected an electric light plant of his own
on property belonging to the gas com
pany, of which he was the president. He
entered into direct competition with the
Dingee' company and a hitter fight was
waged to secure the lighting of the town.
Meyer underbid the Dmgee company, got
the contract and then troubles began.
It was discovered that the site upon
.which the new Meyer eloctric light. plant
had been erected belonged to the Llver
more Gas Light Company and that It had
becn*granted to the gas company by W.
V. Mendenhall with the express contract
that it should bo used for no other pur
pose. Mendenhall began nult against
Meyer and the Livermore Gas L/ght Com
pany to recover the property, claiming
that his contract had been broken.
LIVERMORE, Oct. 23.- The affairs of

Harris said he had known the Miss Kel
ler that Â«aÂ« from childhood. They had
grown up together on shipboard, where
Miss Keiier was bora. Miss Keller's par
eats had died, and Harris cared for ner.
They became engaged two years ago.
Harris went to the Klondike when we
gold discoveries were made ibere. located
a rich claim and made money. He and
Miss Keller kept up a correspondence.
The last letter he received from her was
dated July 2. According to Harris it
burned with affectionate words. Miss
Keller waa supported by a liberal allow
ance which was provided by her. lover.
Harris came back to tian Francisco on
the 20ih oÂ£ last month, expecting to meet
the bride-elect. Inquiry divulged the fact
that his love had flown with another man.
Angry. hÂ« determined to follow them.
After a short search he discovered that
the couple had gone north. As fast as
fctjeam could carry him he sped to Seattle.
At Seattle Harris nearly overtook the
objects of bis pursuit. He was told that
Jlles Keller had worked out during her
brief stay there, while the man she was
:n company with sat around and smoked
good cigars. From Seattle the pursuit
was kept up to Victoria. Vancouver. Port
Townsend and Kverett- At the latter
place the couple discovered that they
were being pursued and fled direct to this
city, where they wore married on the 15th
inst. by Justice Smith. Harris lost the
track for a while, but found it again and
landed in San Francisco two days ago,
whence he traced the couple to
Oakland to-day. He was full enough of
Ire to do anything and blood might have
flowed if he had found Bilyeu. He 'lid not
know the name of the man he was pur
suing until he learned it from the records.
"I lenow that girl would- never have

A REAL SVENGALI
"Why were you willing to make this
written statement you have produced here
and not an affidavit?" insisted Hayne. â¢
j There was a long silence on Woodward's
part, and then Attorney McCutchen came
to the perturbed witness*, rescue with" an
objection.;' "
Woodward declared he did not know a
suit on ; water rates was about to be
brought.
"How did. you expect, then, that an af
fidavit would be used ?" queried Mr.
Hayne. '"'Â¦ l MI'*']prTiH!''Trj*?ll IIP 1 "/' 1 ! 1 ! Jnr*Wm
-.'Â¦ "Oh, affidavits may be used in other
ways than in a suit," airily explained
.Woodward. Â¦ :
. Frank Watson, the clerk who overheard
the t, talk * between Woodward and Mott ,
then told what he claimed he could : re-
Â¦ "I thought the matter, so far, as I was
concerned, would end when I made tha
written memorandum," replied Wood
ward. â¢ Â¦
"How. would your friend. Mott be helped
by , your refraining from making an affi
davit?" queried Hayne..
"No. sir," replied Woodward.
Then Hayne wanted to know if . Wood
ward had not subsequently 'admitted to
Dr.: George C. Pardee and G. B. Daniels
that he was "in a hole" because. of his
exaggerations lo Dingee, and did not want
to say in an affidavit what was untrue.
But Woodward denied that.
"My whole difficulty in this matter was
because of my friendship for Mr. Mott,"
said Woodward.'
Tha row between CuvelUer and Taylor
occurred at one of the meetings of the
committee when the ordinance was under
discussion. Taylor brought in a separate
report and ordinance which he Insisted
should be adopted Such action would
have passed the rate schedule for 1900
1901 down to fame as the "Taylor ordin
ance," But Mr. Cuvellier had his own
ordinance, and he demanded thatit go as
the "Cuve.'ller ordinance." As the* "Cuvel
lier ordinance" it did go, and the van
quished Mr. Taylor's documents went
down Into darkest oblivion.
The chief Incident ot the trial to-day
was the attempt of Frank J. Woodward
and Frank C. Watson, clerks In William
J. Dingee's real estate business, to show
that Â¦ Councilman Mott had made some
damaging statements to them about the
passage of the water rate ordinance.
Mott was recalled by McCutchcn and
put through a course of questioning upon
a talk he had with Woodward. Watson
being near by, at Dingee's office on March
19. Mott had gone there to see Woodward
on a busines3 deal in which they were
Interested. The substance of their talk,
according to Mott. bore upon the actions
of Taylor and Cuvellier in their fight
about the ordinance. Mott denied he had
said the rates were cut and dried or had
declared the cut was too heavy, and that
he was opposed to it.
Then Woodward went to the witness
pt ami. and with much protestation of his
personal friendship for Mott and his keen
appreciation of his embarrassing position,
told how he had gone to Dlngee with the
story of his talk with Mott and that
Dlngee had demanded that he make an
affidavit. He had drawn a â¢written memo
randum of the conversation, snd then, by
order of Dingee, had gone to Attorney M.
C. Chapman to mak* the affidavits.
"But you didn't make the affidavit.
Why not?" demanded Mr. Hayne. .
"I saw Chapman and told him I had put
mv foot In it; that Mott was a personal
frfend of mine; that Dlngee had demanded
an affidavit from me, but I hated to make
it. So Chapman said he would advise
Dingee that an affidavit was not neces
sary."
"On account of your friendship for Mr.
Mott you put your foot In It?" sarcastical
ly commented Mr. Hayne.
"Now isn't it the. fact." continued the
attorney, "that you didn't want to make
an 'affidavit, because you had made an ex
aggerated statement to Dingee ; of that
conversation?"
The story* all came to light during the
trial this afternoon, when Councilman
Mott'was recalled to tell about some con
versations he had with a couple of Wil
liam J. Dingee's employes.
The hitherto undiscovered reason why
Councilman Felton Taylor waÂ« not In ac
cord with his colleagues in the City Coun
cil in *he fixing of water rates last spring
has been exposed. Councilman Taylor was
anxious to shine before his constituents
as the father of the ordinance which was
to cut the rates to the consumers of Oak
land. But his ambitions in that direc
tion were opposed very strenuously by
Chairman B. C. Cuvellier of the Fire and
Water Committee, who argued that he
was entitled to proclaim his parentage of
the document which is now the bone of
contention In the Superior Court.

OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â The question of
the revision of the "Westminster confes
sion of faith of the Presbyterian church
has agitated the Presbyterian denomina
tion from one end of the country to the
other of late. There has been much said
and written about the necessity or objec
tion to revision from within the denom
ination, and the question will be earnestly
iiscussed at the next General Assembly.
f The question of how California stands
-pon the matter of revision is entirely in
the har.Â«is of the different presbyteries
of the State. The synod, which recently
clofsf'1 at Berkeley, could take no action
upon the matter, which is in the hands of
the presbyteries, though a number of
references were made to the question.
It Is a matter of great Interest to the
nvrob^rs of that denomination to kn^w
how the various presbyteries of Califor
nia, have voted upon this matter, and the
following table shows the action of the
entlr*' State:
Presbytery cf Ean Franciscoâ Unanimous for
revision.
Presbytery of Benidaâ Unanimous in faror
cf MVtatoB or a shorter creed.
Presbytery of Los * Angeles â Twenty-sir
From this it will be seen that the gen
eral sentiment of the Presbyterian de
nomination Is for some revision of the
Westminster confession of faith, though
the extent of the revision is not indicated.
But one presbyteryâ that of Los Angeles â
voted a majority against any revision.
Some desired an entirely new short creed,
while, the great majority are for mild re
vision or supplementary explanation.
Rev. James Mitchell, moderator of the
synod which has Just adjourned, said in
regard to the matter, of revision:
"I think ihat most of the presbyteries
of California are in favor of mild revi
sion, especially In the phraseology of some
sentences of the creed. To what extent
this will go U entirely a matter for future
development." : -
against any change in the confession of faith
and twenty-three for a ch*neÂ».
Presbytery of Oaklandâ S#v?ntÂ«en for some
char.gre and ten against any change.
Presbytery of Sacramentoâ In general for
mild revision.
Presbytery of San Joeeâ Nine for limited re
vision and eight for a short new creed.
Presbytery of Santa Barbaraâ Eleven for re
vision and four against any change.
Presbytery of Stocktonâ Ten for a supple
mentary creed; four for short new creed and
nine for no chance whatever.

BERKELEY. Oct. 23.â A veterans'
association of the University of
California has been formed by the
students who took part in the
Spanish-American war and the
suppression of the Filipino Insurrection.
The membership is limited to students and
faculty, and all men must show an honor
able discharge from the army before they
will be accepted into the association.
The object of the organization is not
alone to bring together the students of
this university who have rought under the
flag, but to help form and be part of a
national organization of student veterans.
To this end Eastern colleges will be com
municated with, and a committee from
Stanford University and Berkeley will
meet in Palo Alto next Sunday. This com
mittee will form plans for Joining the two
organizations in this State and will then
endeavor to make a national affair out of
it. The committee is composed of Pro

PETALUMA, Oct. 23.â Andrew Ducker,
a wealthy Petaluma rancher, and his son
in-law, John Lopus of Penngrove, were
arrested . upon the complaint of I Edward
D.\ Gregg, who alleges- that Ducker and
Lopus threatened to kill him. The ar
rest was the result of a quarrel which
began several days ago, when Gregg
struck 1 Ducker after the two had had a
heated argument. Bystanders interfered
and prevented serious trouble.
On Sunday Gregg . and Frank Green
"were bicycle riding on the Lakeville road,
with , a couple df young ladles, when,'
Gregg claims, Ducker ana Lopus drove up
|and renewed -the quarrel. * Gregg claims
fthat Lopus and Ducker produced a knife
'and a revolver and threatened to kill him.
Gregg ran Â¦ across a field Â¦Â¦ out of ? danger.
On the* other. hand Ducker declares that
Gregg drew ' a : revolver, but , when dared
to shoot <he put up the weapon and. fan

Petaluma Rancher and His Son-in-
It Is said for Mr. Newman that his"
check for $500, which has been dishonored,
undoubtedly would be taken care of, as
he had more than one such experience
during his brief visit in Los Angeles, and
always came to the scratch before it was
too late.
ACCUSED OF HAVING
THREATENED MURDER
Before leaving Los Angeles Mr. New
man gave as reference * concerning his
financial standing certain New York rank
ers and Standard Oil magnates. He also
declared that he was yet a member of
the New York Stock Exchange. Such of
these assertions as have i been . Investi
gated have been found to be untrue.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 23.â W. G. New
man of North Carolina and New York,
plunger and man of the world, is wanted
by the" Southern Pacific Company and
others, and will be- stopped from, sailing
from San Francisco for Panama as he
had intended, unless he makes good a
check drawn on New York for- $500, which
has gone to protest.
Mr. Newman burst' upon Los Angeles
like a meteor two weeks ago. Stories of
his vast wealth had preceded him. He
was at once voted "a "good thing" up and
down Spring street, and when not buying
wine for those he considered his friends,
he stood ready to act as the angel for
any theatrical enterprise which might
have the ill fortune to need his services.
He offered to loan William Walker of
"That Man". a cool 52000.
But Mr. Newman, who was supposed to
have had some trouble on the New York
Stock Exchange, tired of Los Angeles and
purchased passage for himself and the
ladles of his party to Panama, giving
therefor New York exchange for $500.
This draft has now been returned through
the local bank, marked "no funds."

in $300 worth before he discovered the
fraud. â¢ .- Â¦.
Three men were arrested, suspected of
the crime, on one of whom was found
J1000 m genuine money. No Incriminating
evidence, however, has been discovered to
connect the men with the crime.
It Is feared by the police that this de
cision will put an end to all arrests in
the District of Columbia on telegraph
advices from other jurisdictions, and that
known criminals can come to this city
with the knowledge that they will be free
from arrest at least until formal legal pa
pers arrive from the jurisdiction in
which the crime has been committed.
Superintendent Sylvester said to-day that
as long as the police court, which has
held criminals arrested at the Instance of
the outside jurisdiction, stands by the
police they will continue-.to make arrests.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL, * WASHINGTON, Oct. Â£ 23.â Wash
ington wiir, become a refuge, for criminals
and crooks: of all kinds. Justice Bradley
,of the Supreme Court of the- District of
Columbia -has -announced a; decision in
habeas, corpus proceedings which, accord
ing to Superintendent of Police Sylvester,
â¢will make it possible for. criminals from
outside the District of Columbia' to walk
the streets of ..Washington without danger
of arrest.". .' ..':.'
In this case two men, George H. Wilson
and CM. Bush, who had been arrested
on a 4elegram from the Chief of Police of
Chicago, were taken into court on a writ
of .habeas -corpus. They were - charged
with extensive swindling In the sale of
bogus mining stocks. Superintendent
Sylvester submitted an affidavit declaring
that a' requisition for the men was doubt
less, en route', to Washington, and the
Assistant - District - Attorney urged; that
they should be held pending the arrival
of the requisition. '
Justice < Bradley decided that a tele
gram from Chicago was not sufficient au
thority for arrest, and that the plain let
ter of the law left him no course but to
release tire- men. In announcing his de
cision Justice Bradley said that a man
could not be arrested without a proper
warrant or detained s In a police station
until some charge was made against him.
He said that no one, /whoever he might
be, had authority to make an arrest for
an outside jurisdiction unless,- on a war
rant'from the Chief Justice Of the Su
preme Court of the jurisdiction in which
the arrest was made. He held that the
men arrested on a telegram from some
source in the city of Chicago had been de
tained without authority of law, and or
dered their release. .4

ST.- LOUIS, Oct. 23.-A11 railroad lines
west and southwest of the Mississippi
River, comprising about 130,000 miles of
trackage, took action here to-day on the
pass agreement for the coming year. Gen
eral Manager Howard Elliott of the Bur
lington was in the chair and all lines were
represented. The old agreement was re
affirmed and an additional clause adopted
providing a penalty for violation of the
agreement Each line Is .to put up a
deposit and upon conviction* for violation
of the agreement by the local committees
a fine of $100 will be imposed and at once
collected.
A resolution was introduced to abolish
free transportation entirely for the* com
ing year, but on being put to a vote it
was lost, as was a similar resolution at
the meeting held here last year. It was
felt that the conditions, were not ripÂ« for
such a radical measure, but > a committee
was appointed to confer with the execu
tive officers of lines in all other sections
of the country looking to the adoption of
such action in the future.
Local Committees were appointed at St.
Louis. Chicago, St. Paul, Kansas City and
Omaha, with , discretionary power as to
the Issuance of passes.
Resolution to Abolish Free Transpor
tation for the Coming Year
Is Put to a Vote and
Defeated.'
Old Agreement Is Reaffirmed

produced and filed for probate yesterday,
but not until its custodian, "I nomasC.

Ing before him. A petition for the pro
duction of the will was filed by Katherine
Newland. She stated that the testament
was in possession of Klerulff, out that he
had refused to oroduce the same. The
petition was called for hearing. Judge
Troutt was convinced that the allegation!;
therein were correct and he ordered the
respondent to produce the. document.
Klerulff demurred and Judge Troutt
committed him for contempt of court.
Klerulff deposited â¢ bonds for his release
and applied to the Supreme Court fpr. a
writ of habeas corpus. The writ was .de
nied by the Supreme Court yesterday
morning and Klerulff was taken into cus
tody by the Sheriff. He forthwith weak
ened and produced the will. Judge Troutt
then made a formal order purging him
of contjempt and ordering his release from
custody. The estate disposed of in the
will is of great value.

The Armour Packing Company of New
Jersey has met defeat in Its effort to
evade the assessment levied by Assessor
â¢ Dodge against Its franchise for the sum
of $10,000, the tax due upon this assess
ment being In the neighborhood of J20D.
The case was called' by Judge Seawell
yesterday. The packing company con
tended that as it was incorporated under
the laws of New Jersey and held its
franchise from that State It could not be
taxed for a franchise in. this State. . On
behalf of the city, however, It was con
tended that the exercise in this State by
the packing company of Ks corporate
franchise had a value which, under our
lawE, is taxable. Judge Seawell sustained
*.he position taken by the Assessor. An
appeal will be taken.

VISITOR CLAIMS TO - BE
SCHLATTER AND WANTS
TO BE BURIED ALIVE.
In the strange story there is a strange
mysticism. Seven is policy" and unJU the
healer travels seven times arouncl the
world his mission will not be over. He is
now on his, seventh Journey and we will
have him for a month* Then Los Angeles
will be favored, and Mexico is probably
the next in line. The healer has hired a
When he left Denver In 1S94 he traveled
to the mountains of Colorado, where, he
says, with remarkable unconcern, he was
burled for forty days and nights while
his soul went to heaven and he. held dis
course with God; But God, he says, won't
let him tell what was said or where he
was buried. These interesting details will
not be divulged until the Rev. Charles Mc-
Lean, M. D., completes his mission, and
like the favored prophet of old rises in
bodily form to heaven.
she sought to press upon him. Andrew
Carnegie, whom- the healer 3ays he mar
ried, wanted him to. take two millions, but
again that Implacable refusal was Inter
posed.
After "Schlatter" disappeared from
Denver in 1S94 the newspapers said that he
was dead. And while the healer has a
great respect for the newspapers he In
sists that they, were wrong. The press,
he declares, has a power next to God, but
that the press of San Francisco will treat
him unkindly. God, he says, always tells
htm things in advance, and this is one of
the warnings b'een given. But
he will not be* discouraged.
OUR local Board of Health seem*
to be composed of gentlemen who
have fame thrust upon them. An
old man has arrived In this city
and asks the gratification of a
singular request. He Is apparently earn
est, and. like all enthusiastic persons, has
a mission. He wants the Board of Health
to bury him alive In Golden Gate Park,
plant the grass over his grave, keep him
there for forty days and then dig him up
to accept his congratulations. The old
man believes in" himself, and he may be
familiar enough with recent events In San
Francisco to believe that our Board of
Health' "will grant his request.
He says he is the original Schlatter. the
divine healer who set Chicago, Denver
and other American cities In an uproar a
few years ago. Most people think, he
says, that he Is dead, but j they are In
grievous error. He admits modestly that
he has been to heaven and has had sev
eral consultations with God, but he has
returned to earth again to resume his
mission of divine healing and to make the
blind see, to make the deaf hear, to cause
the dumb to speak, to cure the thousand
ills that man is heir to, to give reason to
the mad and life to the dead.
There Is no doubt that this old man be
lieves in himself and his mission to make
others believe in him. He speaks with
quick, nervous energy. He tells with a
flood of details experiences remarkable,
incredible, amazing. His patriarchal gray
beard, strong features, keen, cold blue
eye?, glre marked character to him and
command attention â¢ where levity might
Intrude. He says he is 54 years of age
and looks ten years older.
His name is Charles McLean and he is
a clergyman and'a physician. His story
of his life must carry its own meaning
and worth. Before he was born, he says,
God told his mother that she was to have
a marvelous' son. He was born in New
York where the Hoffman now stands and
at an early age was taken to Scotland.
From his earliest years, he says, he felt
the inspiration of his divine purpose, the
imposition of hands and the saving of life.
With the manner and unconcern of a man
saying that he. has Just dined he say?
that he brought three dead men in Chi
cago back to life and did the same for
four other cadavers "in London. And he
promises. to give life _to ..any corpse that
has not yet, mortified in San Francisco.
If William Jennings Bryan wereonly.here
âor perhaps his Highness the Mayoi
might do. . . .
Nor does Schlatter, the divine healer,
confine his ministering hands to dead
ones. He offers to restore reason to any
crazed being that may be. brought from
an asylum. With those magic hands of
his he says he cured 2000 . people in a
single day in Denver. He insists that he
placed his hands upon Rudyard Kipling
and cured him of pneumonia that was fast
dragging him to the grave. With a shrug
of the shoulders he declares that he re
fused " $50,000 which Mrs. Kipling offered
him in gratitude because that is another
story which the novelist probably won't
tell.
More marvelous to relate, the. healer
says Richard Croker gave him $5000 and
then descending into the stefn realm of
probability he says William R, Hearst
offered him* a million dollars. Hetty
Green, that shrewd, sharp, grim gatherer
of gold, offered him, he* declares, five mil
lion dollars, but as he didn't need the
money he refused it. Then,- his strange
story runs. Helen Gould was sad because
he wouldn't take a million dollars which

"Why did you allow that to go on for
so many years?" asked another Juror.
"We did not know; It," Â¦ was the answer.
"Mr.. Ewing, would charge some of these
shipments on his private books and some
on our books. He resigned sooner than
turn- over his personal books for my in
spection."
Other witnesses who were intimate per
sonal friends of Captain Ewinsr testified
that Ewlng's storyjof the reason for his
resignation was that he could not afford
to work for people who were not satisfied
with him; that his employers were hound
ing him about -the business and he 'could
not endure It any â¢ longer. His friends
thought he was a little unbalanced in
mind since his stroke of apoplexy about
a year ago. . â¢
himself."
"As I understand It, he sold goods at
one price and returned to the company a
lower price?" put in a juror. ,
.The witness responded In the affirma
tive. -*;' ..Â¦Â¦:.

were not consigned to Jiirn," said the
Juror. ...
"No, sir," was th,e reply. "He was un

fairs.the first or second day after I came
here and. I labored .with him to have him
unburden himself to me. On Weonesday
my house telegraphed td me: 'We must
have from Captain Ewing what he has
sold these goods for and to whom he had
sold them.', He had billed the goods to
"Well," replied â¢ Auditor Thompson,
"perhaps it could be- called embezzlement.
I have not yet had time to determine how
much he was short. I don't wisn 'anything
to come up against me in case we should
proceed to collect on his bonds."
"Two days before h's death Ewing con
fessed to me that he had done wrong:
that he had not executed his /trust prop
erly. He appropriated sales transactions
to himself on which he made profit which
we should, have received. He did not
credit the company on his books."
"Then he did embezzle?" asked the Cor
oner."
"Your manner was >o to me, sir, when
I visited the office to 'View the body," re
torted the Coroner ferociously. ,
Mr. Thompson then proceeded Â¦ to tell
his- story as follows:
"No, sir," was the reply. "On the con
trary, he told Miss Burns that I was very
kind to him. I did not ask him for an
explanation in a hounding manner."
"Yes," persisted the Coroner, "you haa
something to do .with it, undoubtedly. I
don't w&nt to be understood as charging
you with having 'administered the gas to
him, but haven't, you been, hounding
him?"
"Then," said the Coroner, "you let this
man go to his grave with a smirch on his
reputation?"
"I didn't have anything to do with his
death," replied the witness. .. â¢ ' ' '
"Mr. Ewihg resigned because he could
not or would not .explain to me certain
transactions. I exacted of him explana
tions almost every day in the w.eek. My
company has instructed me not. to an
swer any*' Questions as to the total
amount, involved in these transactions."
