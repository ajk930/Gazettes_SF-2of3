JAMESTOWN*. N. T.. Nov.^.-Gov
ernor RooFevelt finished the next to
the last tfay of his New York State
tour In this dty. after having trav
eled through five counties, making
Â¦fifteen speeches during the day. The two
Ftops where the most time was spent were
Lt Dunkirk and Jamestown. His speeches
during the day and at both of these cities
were flavored with vigorous attacks on
Richard Croker and National Democratic
Chairman Jones for their alleged attitude
en the counting of the ballots, which Gov
ernor Roosevelt diagnosed as an Incite
ment to violence. At both Dunkirk and
Jamestown, and especially in the latter
place to-night, there were immense audf
ftnees.
At Dunkirk, where three meetings were
held, the Governor In addressing the first
open-air meeting. In front of the Brooks
locomotive Works. which suspended
work In order to give their employes an
opportunity to hear, replied to Mr. Bryan,
and eald among other things:
"I want to take up one or two state
ments made last Saturday by Mr. Bryan
v.-hfn he was here. In the first place. Mr.
Bryan said that the argument of the din
ner pall was bad. because It Â¦was not full.
Now, I don't exactly know how full it is.
but I do know it Is four times as full as
it was four years ago. Here are figures
for the present year for these works as
compared with 1836: The average monthly
wage* paid out are a little over $100,009,
as a&ainet $28,000. That Is an Increase of
-57 per cent. The average number of en
pines turned out is twenty-eight per
month, as against eight, and the number
of mÂ«i at work Is 2109, as against 801. Mr.
Bryan said If we were prosperous It was
v.ot due to ue. Well. I tell you one thing.
Mr. Bryan iÂ» not responsible for It"
"You bet your life he la not," shouted
cae of the grimy worklngmen. BSBI
[ The Governor smiled and continued :
| "He said It was due to Providence. Well.
; Providence helped us, because i It helped xls
j to keep Mr. Eryan out. â¢r\;-^;-^- ':' -.. ; 'Â¦'Â¦'-.
< Â¦ "Mr. 'Bryan denounced imperialism. One
of the engines that you have here. for. ex
i portat!on J3 to go to Japan. . If we plve
] up any effort to hold our own In the East
i then say good-by to any chance of ex
tending our commerce and obtaining a
j market In the Asiatic Hemisphere. We
j are able to export our locomotives and
i our goods because we are taking: up our
! position in the forefront of the nations of
the world. Let mo give you an example:
Eight years aÂ»ro expansion was not In our
; line, and the French took the Island of
Madagascar. You say that was no con-:
I cern of ours. Well, it was. for the first
j thing that happened was that the market
: we had there for 11,000,000 yards of Ameri
can cloth was closed Immediately. If Mr.
Bryan had his way and we retired from
our possessions In the Philippines .you
would find that the market for engines
j and everything In Asia would be closed' to
us. If you vote for Mr. Bryan's policy
we will have such conditions as we had
four years ago. These works will feel
them, you will hurt every man who is
concerned In any way as a proprietor of
the works; you will get at them, but will
gret at everybody else. too. The whole
"truth Is. that we all of us go up or go
down together. When hard times come
they come to each of us. and when pros
perity comes something of the prosperity
comes to each of us. I agree with Mr.
Bryan that there are other things besides
the full dinner pall Involved. He is quite
right, and they can be comprehended by
the word 'patriotism,' the honor of the
flag, the honor of the nation."
At the Jamestown meetings the Gov
ernor confined himself principally to an
swering Mr. Bryan's argument on impe
rialism. .-Â¦>ââ¢

GHICAGO. Nov. .1.â William J.
Bryan this . afternoon began -his
three days' Itinerary of this city,
. addressing: a vast concourse; at
Randolph street and Mlcnigan
avenue. The speaker's stand was at the/
side of the public library, and so dense
was the throng around It that the Presi
dential candidate was literally dragged to
the platform by a squad of policemen act
ing under the personal supervision of
Mayor Harrison, who had ridden with Mr.
Bryan from the railway station. Mr. Bry
an was escorted from the Dearborn-street
station by the Cook County .. Democratic
Club through Dearborn street. Jackson
boulevard, Clark. Madison. Lasalle . and
Randolph streets, which were lined with
humanity. ' The hour was especially
auspicious, as thousands ,r\ worklngtnen
and office employes had just completed
their day's task and awaited the coming
of the Democratic champion. ' , :
Mr. Bryan was in excellent voice and
this he used to good effect In reducing the
storm of cheering that greeted him when
he was Introduced. His speech was ap
plauded almost Incessantly, and at its
conclusion he was driven to the Audito
rium, where he took dinner, after which
he proceeded on his tour of the northwest
side of the city, where he made eight
speeches, all of them \o large crowds.
Â¦ At the stand near the public library, on
the lake front. Mr. Bryan said In part:
"When we speak of the business men
to-day under whose auspices this meeting
Is held we refer to those business men
who are Included In that narrow appli
cation of the termâ those who are en
gaged in merchandising and in trading. I
am glad to .have a chance to speak to this
kind of business men. for Â¦ I believe that
the Democratic party to-day appeals to
the business man as well as to the laborer
and farmer- BfidB
"I believe that the last four years have
taught the business men that the Demo
cratic party Is the conservative party of
this nation and that the Republican par
ty, is the revolutionary party. The Dem

foundations, of : Industrial Independences
and to destroy Industrial monopoly, now

Mr. Bryan's speech to the large audience
which greeted him. at Monon was.an ap
peal to Republicans to lay: aside party

"Since the last election, men have been

said he was. dead. Patrick was then very
nervous and excited and he asked the doc
tor how long he. had been dead.. The doc
tor replied:. 'About twenty minutes.' Af
ter the body . had been laid out Patrick
gathered up all the letters. I was with
him. and had as much as he to do with
that. He gathered in: the two Watches
and all the -money that was in- the trunk.
Patrick selected, such as he wanted from
the papers. â¢ He told me: that, he wanted
all the valuable papers. The next day he
returned, and had with him bankbooks
arid checkbooks. -He had a number of
blank checks,-. T have some checks that
I want 'you to fill out,': he- said. ; â¢ 'One on

filled out for $05,000 on M. Swenson &
Sons, one for $25,000 on the Fifth-avenue
Trust Company and one for $135,000 on the
same company. lie told me he had the
proper right to cash these checks before
Rice's death became knownâ his words
were, 'legal right.' He left at 8:30 or 9
o'clock and said he would telephone me
to dictate messages tobe sent to relatlvea
and Baker and to tell, the bank, if-.it
called up. tha K the checks were. good.
About 11:30. o'clock he called me- up and
paid: "We've made a bust of it.' He again
told me to tell the bank that the checks
were all right. About ten -minutes later.
Mr. Wallace called up and asked for Mr.
Rice. He asked me If the checks were In
my handwriting. I told him yes, if you
send up I- will correct It. That is how he
explained the spelling of the name Albert
'Abert' Instead of correctly. Then he tol.l
me to have Mr. Rice come to the tele
phone. I said: 'Very well.' and rang off.
Then I called urÂ» Patrick and tolfl him.

to .the telephone and asked about Rice.

Mr. Patrick said: 'I will" be at the house
about 7-o'clock. He came about 7 o'clock
and had a package/ of papers and sat in
a. chair bv the bed, talking to Mr. Rice,
and Mr. Rice, took the papers from- him.
Mr. Patrick said: 'Why do you wish the
papers?' I do not remember Mr. Rice's
answer. Mr. Rice told Patrick that he
was very nervous and did not -wish to
be. troubled. Mr. Patrick asked me for a
towel and a sponge and I got them for
lilm. He then asked me to leave the room.
I left the room. Â¦ He said: 'I will remain
with Mr. Rice until he goes to sleep and
will so out the side door.' Two minutes
later I heard- Mr. Rice laughing ' after I
left; the roonv I went to the door *nd
peeped in and saw Mr. Rice lying on his
back and the towel was folded in a cone
shape and . was over . his i whole face -and
Patrick was holding it over his face with
his right hand. Mr. Patrick did not see
me, nor did Mr. Rice. I opened the door
just enough to see what was going on. and
just as soon as T saw the position : of
things I went and lay down on my bed
and went to sleep.": . r Â¦
Assistant District Attorney Osborne this
afternoon gave out a more detailed state
ment of what Jones said of. the happen
ings subsequent to Rice's death. He said,
quoting from Jones' statement:
Â¦ "When I waked up about 8- o'clock the
morning following Rice's death, having
been in the habit of carrying water to
him since his sickness. I asked him then
If he wanted water and he did not answer.
I took up his hand and it. was limp and
lifeless. I at once saw that he was either
â¢feigning or dead. I first looked around
the house for Patrick and sent for the
doctor. I told Friend Patrick that Rice
was either sick or dead. I asked him:
'Where have you been and how did you
get away? 1 He answered: 'I will go and
get the doctor and come up.' The doctor
arid Patrick. came together about 8:30 or 9
Jones Fills Out Checks.
'Now, Jones, we've got to get all of the
old man's papers: Understand, we must
set a-U of them.' We took aH the papers
we could find and Patrick bundled them
all up and took them away with him:
Monda;- morning Patrick camÂ£ to Â¦' Mr.
Rice's house. He had a check book, in
his hand, he said:: 'This Is Mr. Rice's
check .book.' Then he showed me. two
checks signed W. M. Rice. 'Now,* he said,
'I want you to fill out . the amounts of
these checks," and at his request -I' filled
out one for 125.000 and another for $65,000.
"Ab to the. embalming of Mr. Rice's
body, the letter used was dictated by. Mr.
Rice, either in July or August, but it was
not signed- by. him.' I saw this ' letter
among Rice's papers on several occasions.
Inasmuch as I went up town to see Senior,
the undertaker, while Patrick made the
arrangements for the undertaker,. I aid
not. see the letter that Patrick gave to the.
undertaker.- I ha\ - e seen it several times
since, however, and can state positively
that it was the letter unsigned among Mr.

Jonesfever confessed and bases his belief
on Â¦ what he says Jones told him on
VVedriesday. After calling attention to tin
fact that millions are at stake in the mat
ter Mr. House said:
"The. confession is said to have beevx
made.voluntarlly Tuesday night. Mr. Os>
bcrnie says that Captain McCluskey was
not present. When I visited Jones in tha
City Prison yesterday he told me that htj
had been subjected to the third degrc â¢>Â¦
the night previous. He said that he ha<l
bfcen told that 1 wanted to see him. 'I
knew it was contrary to the regulations
for you to be admitted at that hour,' sail
Jones, 'but I went with the keeper witU
uut suspicion. I was taken past the coun
sel room into what I suppose is the
warden's office. Th*re I found Mr. Os
borne. Captain McCluskey. Captain Ba
ker, Mr. Byrne, Mr. Miller and two other
men whom 1 do not know.'
"J suppose that was one of the strang
ers who is referred to now bv Mr. Os
borne as a friend of Jones. I would llko
to have his name. Jones said that he wai
asked to make a confession. 'What dk1
they want you to confess?" I asked. 'Well.
they wanted me to confess that the
checks were forged: that the will wa;
forged, and that the old man was mur
dered.' <i
DENIES HAVING CONFESSED. .
Jones Tells His Attorney That He
chloroformed. Mr. Osborne said Jones had
spoken of hearing the old man laugh, and
he said it is well known that a certain
anesthetic produces laughter.
Mr. Osborne was also asked if in the
event of Jones' death his confession could
be used against Patrick.
"Of course not." he replied
Some one suggested that Jones* ante
mortem statement could be secured and
used.
"An ante-mortem statement," said Mr.
Gsborne. "made by a third party Is of no
use. It must be made by a party about to
die. No person knows better than Patrick
that In the event of Jor.es" death the cor.
fesslon could nut he used. He Is a law
yer. He knows that dead men tell no
tales. '

erick Browne of 'this city, died here last
night of pneumonia contracted In Galves

thing*.possible was done to save her, but
the cold and exposure endured In the great
flood was too much for her slight frame.
room. The atrociousness of the offense
and the death of Mrs. Gamble, the girl's
mother, when she learned her daughter
had been the victim of a brutal' assault
aroused intense excitement, and talk of
lynching Ortega was freely heard at the
time of his arrest; . ,
District Attorney Campbell fmished his
argument to the jury shortly before noon
Judge Lorleah then charged the Jury, and
at 11M5 they -retired.: At 4 o'clock they
came into court, and asked to have the
testimony of Dale Holland, a witness who
said he saw' Grace Gamble climb into Or
tega's buggy, read. This was done. The
Jury again retired to deliberate, and at 8
o'clock reached a verdict, finding Ortega
guilty as charged. â¢ , .
Judge Lorigarr named November 16 as
the time for sentencing Ortega. Attorney
Brooks gave notice of a motion for a new
trial, and the matter. will be heard then.
Ortega, who has gained some reputation
as a prize-fighter, is 26 years of age He
is a graduate of the Whittier Reform
School, and with his brothers has been
constantly In trouble.-. One brother has'
served a term in San Quentin. two' are
now in Whittier and, one at the lone

"Winship Again on Trial.
SAN JOSE, Nov. l.-The second trial of
Thomas J. Winshlp, accused of murder
for killing Frank. Narvaez in a local res
taurant, began In. the Superior Court to
day. At the first trial the Jury failed to
reach a' verdict. .
he moved to Sonoma County and located
on the old homestead where he died. A
widow and seven children survive him.
From earliest chlidhood Deacon Crane
has been associated with the Baptist
church and was one of the founders of the
First Baptist Church of Santa Rosa.
When the local church built its present
edifice Robert Crane gave more than half
the money required.
A coincidence In his death is that forty
eight years ago the first meeting of the
State Baptist convention was held in
Santa Rosa and Deacon Crane was elect
ed its first president. That same body of
Christians is in session In this city now,
almost a half a century later. This con
tention, will conduct the funeral services.
. Another fact that may be- said, of Dea
con Crane is that during his residence
near, this city he has traveled over 16,000
miles to attend church in Santa Rosa.
Â¦In Deacon Crane's death Sonoma Coun
ty lost one of her oldest citizens and most
honorable Christian gentlemen, and ' the
Santa Rosa Baptist church one of its
strongest supporters.
SAN JOSE HANDICAPPED.
Narrow Boundaries.
Poor Census Showing Because of Its
SAN JOSE. Nov. 1.â The narrow limits
of San Jose mitigated against the city In
the census report, and instead of being a
city of over 30,000 and occupying fourth
place in the list of cities of the State it is
accredited with only 21,500. The returns
of San Jose Township show a population
of 31.9S7. which virtually represent the
city. and Its suburbs, all contrlbutary to
San Jos?. This city covers the smallest
territory of any city in the State. Its
boundaries have never been extended as
in other cities. At least 10.000 people live
Just outside the limits of the city, within
twenty minutes! ride of the center of busi-
n es . s ; i^ lth T a reasonable extension of .the
limits San Jose would be a city of 30.000.
The subject of extension has 'been talked
of for some time, but now it is believed
the matter will be pushed.

about the courthouse, throughout the trial.
During the argument they filled the court-
CALIFORNIA has become the cen
ter of the interest of the railway
telegraphers of the country, and
all owing to the special meeting
of the Grand Division of the Or
der of Railway Telegraphers, which re
cently closed In. St. Louis. The next meet
ing of the order. will be held in San F*ran
clsco. and the telegraphers of the South
ern Pacific system are going- to try to
elect George Estes of Roseburg. Or., the
general chairman of Southern Pacific Di
vision No. 53. grand president of the order
as vindication for a slight that was heap
ed upon Estes by W. V. Powell, until re
cently grand president.
All of this hinges upon the troublesome
times that occurred just before the spe
cial meeting was held in St. Louis, of
which the removal of Estes by Powell was
but an incident. . .
W. V. Powell had been president of the
Order of Railway Telegraphers for sev
eral years. He had a high standing as an
org-anlzer, but of late had been having
trouble with nearly all of the officers
of the Qrder and among taem Estes, who,
as general chairman' of the Southern Pa
cific â¢ Division, headed - the -argest single
division that is connected with the order.
Powell and Estes had a disagreement and
Powell removed Estes from his position.
This did not please the members of the
order .employed by the Southern Pacific.
Company, at whose head Estes stood. .As
the Southern Pacific Division Is the. larg
est division in the country, .with over
1000 members,' their displeasure, made
itself felt in the order, Estes stands
very high with the men on his 'division
and so- well among the railroad organiza
tions that when the brotherhoods were
fighting the Huntlngton insurance scheme
and a joint grievance committee was ap
pointed Estes was chosen as the general
chairman of this joint grievance commit
tee, empowered to wait upon C. P. Hunt
ington. The railroad men give much
credit to Estes for the, success of those
negotiations. ' Â¦. .'. :'Â¦'.Â¦"Â¦ : . . ;.' : â¢
Then Powell had a disagreement with
Secretary- H, B. Perham' of St. Louis
when he tried to transfer money from the
insurance fund to the generalfurid of the
order. There were other disagreements,
and finally a call was made for a special
session of the Grand Division to consider
the case of President Powell, It only
requires a call signed by twenty-flye di
visions to call a special session, but forty
divisions signed the call in thin . case.
Charges were preferred against Powell
and he was removed from office and ex
pelled from. the Order of Railway Tele
graphers by a: vote of 129 to 6. " M. M.

It was the opinion of the witness that a

not only as to. the necessity for and the
nature of the operation to be performed

geon. It was -not proper either, he said
that *uch dtllcate operations should be
performed in private. The patient should
have been taken to a sanitarium or hos
pital.

three-quarters of an hour. He had exam

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL,' WASHINGTOIN, Nov. 1.â A
method has been adopted for. settling the
indemnity- question -in connection with
the Chinese negotiations that the authori
ties feel confident will result In effecting
a settlement, 'so far, at least, as China is
concerned. â¢â¢
â¢ This contemplates the agreement on the
part of the Ministers in China upon Â¦ a
sum which will cover, the claims for In
demnity held by the several, powers and
of requiring its payment by the imperial
Government. When thi'e demand has been
complied with ,the powers . will decide
upon the distribution I Of the amount
exacted. If there should- be any difficulty
in determining upon tjl$ distribution that
will be. equitable and satisfactory, then
the United States proposes that the mat
ter be referred, to the court of arbitra
tion of The Hague. â¢'Â¦'
Favorable as the administration is to
the use of arbitration, thougH as a last
resort, it is apparent to the -authorities
that 4t is not satisfactory to GermanyanO
Great Britain. This opinion is derived
from the fact that, so far as this Govern
ment is informed, neither of these powers
has officially noticed, the Russian suggest
tioir for- arbitration of the indemnity ques
tion in case of protracted divergence of
views.' In order to insure' sach a solution
the consent -of -those powers would neces
sarily have to be obtained.
It Is: proposed D y the President and
Secretary Hay . to continue the present
policy of negotiation until the Ministers in
Peking have" formulated their demands.
Of course, China's compliance will follow
and then the attention of the powers will
be invited to the question of distribution
of the indemnity. Should, negotiations
then occur to show that the powers can
not reach an agreement, the Russian sug
gestion'will be advocated . and pressure
will be- brought : to bear upon the re
calcitrant Kovernments to cause them to
join in the movemerk.. â¢ ' '
Several representatives ' of European
powers called- upon Secretary Hay to-day
and discussed the Chinese question and
especially the Anglo-German agreement.
The rer>lles of France and Japan to the in^
vltations of ' Great Britain and Germany
to assent to the.. Anglo-Gorman agreement
have not been communicated to the State
Department, but the officials have reason
to believe that .they are as announced in

France's position is identical with that of
the United States and It is presumed. that
Russia will make a reply in similar terms.
if she has not already "done -^o.. Three
nationsâ Great Britain. Germany and

Police Judge Cabaniss.
Mrs. Nona Draude, 30 Bernard street,
appeared before Judge Cabaniss yester
day for sentence on the charge of battery
upon Miss Jennie Bole, 1611 Jones street.
Two weeks ago she was fined $10 for bat
tery upon Mrs. Margaret Kerr, 1610 Jones
street, Misa Bole's sister.
Mrs. Kerr and Miss Bole were in court
and in answer to the Judge said that Mrs.
Draude*s. conduct had not improved and
she was constantly insulting them. Then
Mrs. Draude let loose her tongue and she
berated the sisters in language that
startled every one in court. The Judge
vainly tried to silence her and it was not
until he had threatened to Â¦ send her to
1ail for contempt that she subsided.
During the lull the Judge said he would
imoose a fine of $5 upon Mrs. Draude and
he warn"*! her that if she came before
him again she would be severely punished.
"There's your money." said Mrs.
Draude as she clapped a $5 gold piece on
the bench, "and there s plenty more where
that came from. You re not the only
JudKÂ© on. the- bench, if I am arrested
again, and don't you forget -It. I will

JUDICIAL THREAT HAS
NO TERROR FOR HER
The Judge advised them to get warrants
for her, arrest for using vulgar language
and disturbing the peace, but after think
ing over the matter they decided not to
do eo. '..Â¦Â¦Â¦
In a few minutes the sisters returned to
the courtroom and informed the Judge
that Mrs. Draude had threatened them
outside and used vulgar language. She
told Mls3 Bole, "Go in and tell the Judge
that I've got $5 more. If we weren't
where we are I'd smash you now."
Judge had recovered from his surprise at
the verbal onslaught.
"Well." he remarked, "that Is the worst
case I have had before me. I would
rather try ten murder cases than have
that woman before me again."
A bucket brigade was formed and the
flames were soon extinguished with but
slight damage to the boat. The fire wa$
caused by the overturning of a coal oil
lamp.
When he next wakened it was midnight
and the boat's Newfoundland dog Dewey
was pulling and hauling at him in fran
tic efforts to arouse him. The cabin of
the boat was ablaze and the stifling smoke
had, nearly robbed the sleeping man of
consciousness. It is doubtful if Meruzzlo
would have been able to save himself.
Help, however, came from shore and he
was dragged from the cabin.

SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 1.â Captain George
Meruzzio of the sloop Ona had a narrow
escape from being burned to death in the
cabin of hl3 boat while anchored at the
mouth of Greenbrae Creek last night.
That Meruzzlo is alive to-day is due to
the prompt action of his faithful dotr.
which roused him and partially dragged
him from the flames.
The boat is used for carrying vegetables
and was anchored at the mouth of the
creek. The captain's assistant had gone
ashore, and when bed time came the lone

CAPTAIN'S LIFE IS SAVED
BY HIS FAITHFUL DOG
SAN DIEGO.. Nov.' 1.â A petition to de
termine the heirship and title to the estate
of the late John M, Lapp, valued at
about $40,000, was filed in thÂ« Superior
Court, to-day by Attorney J.. S. Callen,
representing the son, John F. Lapp, who
claims that the widow. Kate B. Lapp, was
iiot legally married to the deceased, be
cause trie marriage took place within less
than a year after she had obtained a di
vorce. About $15,000 of the estate is in
this city and the remainder is in Denver.
The greater part of It is in cash. .
John F, Lapp Is the only son of the de
ceased and is the stepson of the widow.
The only other person claiming an Inter
est in the estate is May Belle Lapp, a 13
year-old daughter. The son. in his peti
tion, represents that Kate B. Lapp 1b not
entitled to inherit any of the estate as the
widow or otherwise of the deceased for
the reason that her alleged marriage to
John M. Lapp occurred In this county on
July: 31. -'1893. -and that within less than a
vear prior thereto, on April 29, 1S99, she
obtained a divorce In the Superior Court
of this county. : ' Â¦
The ion also asks that a guardian may
be appointed for the daughter May Belle
to represent her interest In the estate. The
son also filed notice of a motion to vacate
the order for a family allowance of $lo0
a month on tne ground that it Is an Im
proper and unjust charge and is unnec
essary for the support of the family of
the deceased.
John F. Lapp also petitioned for a cita
tion directing the widow, who is the ad
ministratrix of the estate, to render an
accounting. It is claimed that letters
were issued to her on October 27, 18r.9, and

THE FIGHT IN 1V\E SEVENTH.
HARDLY any Congressional district in Califor
nia requires of the Republican party the exer
cise of more vigorous efforts in order to obtain
victory than the Seventh. Fortunately the party has
there a strong candidate, one who led the way to
victory two years ago and who has therefore the pres
tige of past success to cheer the supporters of protec
tion and sound money in their contest against all the
forces that Brvanite fusion can hrinp; against them.
j . . Mr. Needham's victory two years ago was due
I mainly to the desire of the voters to maintain the Mc
] Kinley administration and to Mr. Needham's own
' personal popularity. Those forces which were potent
j then are even more potent now, for during the past
I two years the administration has strengthened its hold
j upon public confidence, and Mr. Needham, having
! been tried in office, can now submit to his con-
I stituency a record of excellent work done for the dis
; trict in the way of promoting its welfare and uphold
j ing all the interests in any way affected by legislation
1 at Washington.
The voters of the Seventh District cannot be un
aware of the advantage a constituency gains by hav
| ing in the House a representative of experience in
I Congressional business. Every intelligent person
knows that a new man in Congress can never do half
aÂ« much as could be done by one of equal fidelity and
j general ability after a long service there. What Mr.
i Needham has accomplished in his first term is there
i fore but an illustration of his fitness for the office.
His real and full worth in the House will begin to
show itself with his second term.
Strong as is the opposition in the Seventh District,
all reports justify the expectation that the majority
of the voters will remain true to the party of prosper
ity. No considerable body of men in that or any

Warner it does not show any prcat regard for farmers
on the part of the editor of the paper. In these days
farm notes are written by people who know some

"I was not friendly to Mr. McKinley four
years. ago. but his administration has been
so admirably managed that in spite of the
deep prejudice engendered by years of po
litical differences I have been compelled
to accord to him the credit of a states
manship so free from error- that no fair
minded American can truthfully challenge
his intelligence, his honesty or his pa
triotism. The unjust and untruthful at
tacks made upon him oy the opposition
ought to strengthen him in the hearts of
the people.
"How any American who loves the re

A. L. SHINN, LIFE-LONG DEMOCRAT,
RENOUNCES THE DEMOCRACY
? . Â¦
Sacramento Lawyer Cannot Support a Party
That Encourages the Enemies of Our
Country.
r~t L. SHINN, one of the prominent
f~\ members of the Sacramento bar,
*;Â¦ ;..Â»â¢ created a sensation at the Repub-
lican County Convention by re
nouncing the Democratic party. Mr. Shinn
had been a life-long Democrat: had at
tended numerous State conventions of
that party as a delegate, and had time
and again stumped the northern counties
of the State for the Democratic ticket. In
fact, he was regarded as one of the lead
ing Democrats of Northern California.
His declaration that he intended to sup
port William McKinley this year has be
come the political sensation of the hour.
Mr. Shlnn gives his reasons for his change
of political faith in the following state
ment: i . . '
"Editor San Francisco Call: At ail
times until the present the Democratic
party in its national platform and
by' Its public acts when in power repre
sented the principle of commercial and
territorial expansion. ' That party fore
saw that our products would exceed our
consumption, and that our territory would
not always accommodate tho population
which rapidly flocked to this countrjV
"From tho birth of that party It ac
quired when in power all the territory
available, and the result of. that policy
gave US a vast area of our most Valuable
possessions. Laying aside all that the
Democratic policy of expansion has done
arid looking: to the declaration of Its plat
forms, it will be seen that the party has
reversed its doctrine. It Is now opposed
to the acquisition of territory ar^d con
demns the administration for securing
Porto RlcOi the Hawaiian Islands and the
Philippines, and denominates the spirit
manifested thereby as a "greedy commer
cialism.' Yet every prior declaration of
the Democratic party was in line with the
idea it now condemns. In 1B44 that party
declared In terms for expansion and de
manded, the annexation of Texas and. re
occupation of Oregon.
"The platform oÂ£ 1S56, upon which James
K. Polk was elected, contained a plank In
the following words: 'Resolved. That
there are questions connected with tho
foreign policy of this country which are
inferior to no domestic questions what
ever. The time has come for the peopla
of the United States to declare themselves
in favor of free seas and progressive free
trade throughout the world and by solemn
manifestation to place their moral influ
ence at the side of their 5 successful ex
ample.'
"That was good Democratic doctrine at
one time, but it is the same policy, it
seems to me, that Is now called 'greedy
commercialism.' . . .
"In 1860 the natiot;al platforms demand
ed the immediate acquisition of Cuba, 1
fail to see any material difference between
the acquisition of Cuba and the acquisi
tion of Porto Rico or even Hawaii. . .
"At the close of the war came the great
tariff fight, and the principal argument
against the Republican tariff was that it
built up a 'Chinese wall" around our com
merce and influence. In the platform of
1S76 it was said that the tariff policy had
degraded American commerce from the
tlrst to an Inferior rank. In 18J>0 it declared
for 'free ships and a living chance for
American commerce on the seas.' Such
was always the Democratic policy until it
was ururped by Bryanlpm.
"As a Democrat I favoied the expansion
THE RANGE LEASES.
THE special committee appointed, by the Na
tional Livestock Association to prepare a bill
for an act providing for the leasing of lands that
are more valuable for grazing than for other purposes
has been collecting data on that subject which will be
used as evtdence.of the utility of the leasing- policy.
The heed ot leasehold protection to preserve ths
range, prevent extinction of the grazing business,
conserve moisture in the arid region, and put an end
to lawlessness and violence which now redden the
range, under the mistaken policy of occupation in
common, is now more apparent than ever. During
this year the conflicts between sheep and cattle
rangers and the conflicts between owners of the same
class of stock have been more violent and destruc
tive than ever. As feed and water decrease by over
grazing, and destruction of the vegetable cover of the
soil, the competition for use of what is left increases,
and the end of this great business is already in sight
unless the forage can be renewed under leasehold oc
cupation and stringent public supervision. /.;"â¢.
It is proposed to adopt a wisely drawn lease law,
and then leave its adoption optional to the land and
stock interests in counties west of the ninety-ninth
meridian. It is difficult to see what objection can be
made to this optional system, Which leaves the policy
subject entirely to the wish of the two great interests
concerned, the land-owner or farmer and the stock
owner.
The committee in charge of the matter, through the
secretary of the National Livestock Association, has
procured from the Government of New South Wales,
Australia, a copy of the land laws of that colony and
a statement bearing upon their practical operation.
There the "runholder," or range man, began, as he
did here, controlling all the land he could and destroy
ing its utility by overstocking, which extirpated the
forage.
Fifteen years ago the matter was taken up by the
Government, and the building of the existing code of
land laws began. All public lands not held as condi
tional purchases, or homesteads, were made subject
to lease. The methods of leasing vary with the use
to which the land may be put. All leases contain
provisions as to how the lands are to be used, and are
limited as to term or area, or both. Local land boards
fix the value and rental by appraisement. Pastoral
leases for the "runholders" are unlimited as to area,
but are limited, to a twenty-eight year term. Their
rental price is fixed every seven years by appraise
ment. These leases cover the range country, and mny
be surrendered at the end of any: seven-year period
by giving notice to the land board; There is also what
is known as: "the occupation license;" which permits
the use of land for grazing by the payment of a license
of not less than $to per section, and is good only for
the current calendar year, all such licenses expiring
on December 31 of each year. This system is to give
a degree of flexibility to the system and accommodate
the runholder who by drought or accident finds his
run unable to support his stock for that season, and
is compelled to seek, temporarily, an enlargement of
his grazing area.
In case of fire, drought, flood or other trouble a
lessee may on application, have conditions, including
payments, suspended for six months or a year.
In appraising lands the local land boards are re
quired to take into consideration the cost of trans
portation to and from the land, its capacity for sup
porting stock and the original conditions surround
inp; it. Reappraisement will he made when demanded,
in which case any depreciation in the value of wool,
mutton or beef produced by the land must be taken
into consideration.
An examination of these colony laws impresses one
with the evident desire to treat justly and encourage
properly the grazing interest as one of great commer
cial and economic importance. Instead of regarding
the stock-ranger as a pernicious person, which is too
often done here, his rights are recognized and his in
terests are properly ?afepcuarded. In fact, he is even
protected against himself and Js prevented from de
stroying his own bu-iness by that cupidity which, for
the sake of one year's profits, would destroy the
chance for many years of prosperity. The committee
has rendered an essential service in securing this di
gest, which shows the working of the leasehold sys
tem under physical conditions which are practically
the same as those of our arid grazing region.
Chief of Police Sullivan wants to redistrict the city
so that patrolmen will not have; so many hills to climb
on their beats. Late night pedestrians can assure the
Chief that his hired men have already overcome the
difficulty. . . . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ..'â¢ . â¢ Â¦ . Â¦

BRYAN ON TriE FULL DINNER-PAIL.
pX URING his New York tour- Colonel Bryan
I 1 spoke at Sing Sing. Pointing to the peniten
â . tiary. he; said that when the State puts a man
in prison it guarantees a full . dinner-pail, but takes
away his liberty, and that the Republican party is of
fering the people a full dinner-pail in exchange for
their liberty^ and that its despotism is as great as the
despotism of thÂ« penitentiary. ' - : .
â¢;'. If men vote their real judgment it would be interest
ing to see "how many would vote to indorse such a
statement and to see how many really believe that the
man who makes it is fit for the Presidency. He began
by denying that there was any change in conditions
since 1896â since the panic of 1893. As his tour
lengthened he was brought face to face with evidence
that industrial restoration is established and prosper
ity is restored tothe whole country. His policy of
denial had to be changed, and he resorted to an ar
gument which compels the admission that in; this
country prosperity and oppression are necessarily iden
tical! The logic of his later attitude is, that to enjoy
liberty men must starve. His vicious perversion of
view and his idea of morality and law are brought out
in his characterization of confinement in the peniten
tiary as despotism, and his attempt to show that con
ditions are the same inside and outside of the prisons
of the country. Now, who believes this fantastic
exaggeration? What good citizen regards punish
ment for crime as despotism? What reasonable man
believes that laboring men. or others, in free life, are
suffering all the punishments of a jail?
.,' It requires no. great strain on the mem 017 to go
fcack to the conditions which began in 1893 and con
tinued to j8o6. It is now hoped by Bryan that by his
exaggerations the voters of Indiana may be brought
to give him the electoral vote of that State. There,
as elsewhere, great and general, prosperity has taken
the place of the preceding poverty and distress.
In the counties of Indiana four years ago under
takers competed for the contract of burying paupers.
In nearly every county the profits of pauper funerals
paid the taxes of the contractors and left them a hand
some sum besides. Now these same contractors can
not even pay their taxes put of their pauper fees.
: Bryan's- leading organ there is the Indianapolis
Sentinel. On December 17. 1893, that paper said:
"Let the preachers .act. The ministers' of Indianapolis
ought to have one common theme to-day, and that
charity. For the present theology should be dropped,
isms laid aside and politics shelved. There exists in
this city to-day a startling necessity for relief. Hun
dreds of families. are on the verge of suffering for
raiment, food and medicine. People will starve to
death in Indianapolis this winter unless those who are
more fortunate give of their comparative abundance,
and give promptly and liberally. It is the duty of the
preachers to call attention to this fact and to rouse
their flocks to the gravity of the situation."
To-day there is no need for such an appeal. The
necessity is not present. Pauperism is reduced to a
minimum. Those who were taking alms in 1806 can
give alms now., and men are no longer gaunt and
children no longer starve. â¢'Â¦ .; . '. . . :
As it is there, sq i* the situation everywhere, and
Bryan meets it by declaring that it is the result of
despotism like that of the penitentiary!
.. Such a statement and its author are beneath
wholesome American contempt. Four years ago he
said that if he were beaten and the gold standard were
affirmed at the polls but few people would be able
to wear shoes, ayd it would be the same with clothes.
This was uttered to a community . of shoemakers,, to
alarm them about the wages of their industry and the
profits of. their business". To-day more people are
wearing: shoes arid better shoes than ever before/and
his evil prophecy proves to have been a lie. But un
rnindfal <iÂ£ its falsity he issues a new series of exag
gerations and a new lot of prophecies, all as false as
those which are discredited by events. *
, The wise publicist and student of affairs shrinks
from the prospect of electing such a man to the
Presidency. To say that it would cheapen that great
office is to put it too mildly. Itwould degrade it and
wntiM.mark the beginning: of the decay of our insti
tutions. ' â¢Â¦ ..Â¦'"....Â¦.: . . ' .
Whatever men may think- o{ the reason for our in
dustrial restoration and revival,. among the thought
ful and patriotic there can be no difference of opinion
as to the effect of Bryan's election. It would pros
trate every interest and every industry in the country.
Whether McKinley has brought prosperity or net,
there iii no denying that Bryan would bring poverty
and ruin again. â¢â¢
IXDTANAPOLTS XEWS-rThe great
questions of this campaign are not for
eign, but domestic. And on domestic
questions Mr. Bryan has been proved to
be wrong and dangerously wrong.
OMAHA BEEâ Nothing Is more certain
than that the evil Influence of Mr. Bryan 3
appears to class feelinsr will long continue,
but if he shall be overwhelmingly defeated
the effect of his teaching will not be mani
fested in a serious form.

SAYS MAINE CHILDREN
WERE NOT KIDNAPED
Judge Cabaniss, However, Holds
They Were Taken From Their
Mother Illegally. '
The case of M. J. White, secretary, and
Officer McMurray of the California So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, and Robert N. Maine, charged
with Kidnaping the four children of Mrs.
Vincent George, Maine's divorced wife,
from her house, 468 Tehama street, Tues
day afternoon, was heard before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday.
Mrs. George, her sister-in-law. Mrs.
Mary George, and her daughter. Cora, all
testified that the two officers and Maine
called at the house and carried away the
children, but she exonerated Secretary
White from taking any active part in the
proceedings. They all eald that Mc-
Murray had called Mrs. George and her
daughter a vile name and had slapped
Mrs. George.
The defendants denied using any vio
lence or vulgar language. The children
had been taken from the mother, as it
was feared she would secrete them to
avoid service of the court in the suit to
have a proper guardian appointed. There
was no intention of taking them out of
the county or State.
The Judge in dismissing the case said
that the defendants had without warrant
or legal process taken the children away
from their mother, who was their legal
guardian, according to the decree in the
divorce suit. The prosecution had, how
ever, failed to show that there was any
Intention to take the children out of the.
county or State, which was essential in a
case of kidnaping, and if any offense had
been committed It was the fajse imprison
ment of the children, which was a mis
demeanor.

IT. S. MARSHAL SHINE
BRINGS GOOD NEWS
Finds the Sentiment of the Business
Community in the East for
McKinley.
. UnltPd States Marshal John H. Shine re
turned from New York yesterday, after
delivering Julian Arnold, accused of em
bezzlement, to two British agents in that
city. Mr. Shine took a look at the politi
cal situation there and says that he does
not wonder at the 4 and 6 to 1 beta made
on the success of the Ilepublican Presi
dential ticket.
Marshal Shino found among a large
number of business men in New York
lifelong Democrats, a feeling that Presi
dent McKlnley Iri the safer man for the
country and that the election of Mr
Bryan would so unsettle public confidence
that much injury to business would be the
result. He found also that ail the Demo
cratic noise was being made by the old
lammany henchmen and that the busi
ness community did : not share In the
hurrah.
Passing through Chicago Mr. Shine
learned that Mr. Cooper of the great de
pa rtmont store firm of SIgel. Cooper & Co
had come out for McKlnloy and that a
large number of his business associates
had done likewise. Four years ago Mi

Three prisoners with long terms to serve
escaped from Alcatraz Island during the
early hours of Wednesday. They were
Frank Kinne, with fifteen years to serve;
C. F. JIuntlngton, serving a ten-year sen
tence, and J. M. Polls, with live" years to
do..
The escape was evidently the result of
a prearranged plan, as it was made from
the hospital, where the guard is not so
strict.
The men complained a few days ago of
being ill and made the complaint so often
that at last they were assigned to a ward
in the hospital. Opportunities were not
lacking for the successful carrying out
of their plans. The men cut the bars In
the wlnuows and when a chance offered
crawled through and dropped to the
ground.
Although the hospital is surrounded by
sentries, the three convicts were not ob
served. They reached the bench, Jumped
into one of the boats used by the Govern
ment employes and rowed away. No trace
of them has been found.
The boats were always kept there, but
in anticipation of just such an event the
oars were removed. It is probable that
the men had assistance from outsiders,
who placed oars where they could easily
be found.
ivinne s sentence of fifteen years was
given for desertion and treason. He de
serted from his regiment in Manila and
some weeks afterward was found In tfiÂ«
company of a number of Filipinos, who
paid he was holding a commission In their
army.

The Supervisors' Police Committee re
ported yesterday in favor Of the indefinite
postponement of the ordinance prohibit
ing persons from .visiting saloons, cafes,
etc.. where liquor?, drinks or cigars are
dispensed and where card pames are
played or carried on. The ordinance wa3
introduced by Supervisor Comte and was
especially aimed at the suppression of the
card games carried on In the Cafe Royal.
The committee took the ground that the
Police Commissioners have full power to
withhold licenses and thereby close such
places. Similar action was taken with
the proposed ordinance making it unlaw
ful for any person to deal, play at or
conduct any game of cards in a saloon or
room connected therewith where drinks
or clears are dispensed. The report of
the committee says:
V.'e, recommend the Indefinite postponement of
the ordinance on the ground that public gamb
ling only exists In conjunction v.ith the sale of
Intoxicating liquors airl a refusal to Issue such
li. -orison will Inevitably repult In the stoppnee
of the gambling. These ordinances place the
power to issue permits to gamble In the hands
of the Police Commissioners. That body al
ready has the power to stop any public gamb
ling by the <-xerci*e of thÂ«> power of revocation
of the llQiior licences.
Supervisor Reed tried to have Incor
porated in the report a recommendation to
the Police Commission that it regulate
public pamblinp in tho Cafe Royal and
any other place of which complaint is
made In the manner indicated. Tobin.
however, demurred to this and the clause
was stricken fmm the report.

An Inspection of the models was held
late yesterday afternoon by Mayor Phe

Pike, and the unanimous verdict was that
the collection furnished, a fine and artistic
display. . . '
There will be no small field to choose
from, nor has the competition for honors
been confined to artists of any particular
section. From all parts of the United
States sculptors of universal note . hayp
presented their plans, and in their en
deavor to secure the approval of their
work have brought out their best Ideas.
From Paris -jomes the design, of a Call

other competitors. Â¦ .

committee for the reception of the
returning California volunteers
which called for the erection of a
monument to the memory of the

enough money to: purchase and any

Will Take Middle Course Regarding
Demand That Fairmount and
Burnett Schools Get Higher
. ' Â¦ .'Â¦ Â¦ Rating. . : ;
. "â¢ .. ':â¢' â â â Â»^^ . ' Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ' : â¢
The Board of Education has dfcided to
designate the Fairmount and Burnett:
schools as .intermediate grammar, schools
and as a consequence the salaries of the
principals of the twa schools, will be in
creased from $12i to $153 per. month. This
proposed' action on the part of the board
is the result of its: attention -having been
called by Superintendent Webster. to the
fact that he had designated the institu
tions as ."-grammar schools, yet the prin
cipals were only in'receipt of the primary
schcfol. salary of $135 per month. Â¦
Webster bases his designation on the
rule .which he recently promulgated that
schools. haying mixed grades shall! be re
garded as grammar schools when the
average daily attendance in the grammar
classes is 175 pupils. The Board of Edu
cation, .however, has adopted a resolutlcn
fixing the attendance required for gram
mar schools at 250 pupils. The board does
not- recognize the authority of the Super
intendent, to fix the grading cf schools
and the latter official claims that the
board is usurping his prerogative in so
aoing. - - - : Â¦ -.Â¦-Â¦-
In â¢ endeavorirg to Induce '-the board to
recognize the Fairmount and ; Uurp.ett
schools a> grammar, schools, Webster di
rects attention to the attendance of gram
mar pupils for the month of August in
those two schools and the Wusnington
School, which the board designates as a
grammar school. The figures are: Wash
ington Grammar, enrollment, 250; aver
age' attendance. 204.1. Fairmount Pri
mary, grammar pupils' enrollment. 2C6;
average attendance, ;I47. Burnett Pri
mary, '202; average attendance, 185.3..
It will be observed that the ngures of
the ' Fairmount School exceed the 250 re
quired by the' board, yet it is rated as a
primary school. The Washington, on the
other hand, with a bare 250 enrolled and
an attendance of only 224.1, i3 recognized
as a grammar school by the board.
Webster regards . this as being incon
sistent on the part of the board. He haa
since written the words "partial pay
ment" en the' monthly demands of- the
principals of the Fairmount and Burnett
schools, calling for $135. as he believes
them to be entitled to $175. :
. "We have practically derided to make
the Fairmount and Burnett schools inter
mediate grammar schools.' 1 said Chair
man Mark yesterday. "Our attention
was called some time ago to the status of
the schools by 'Superintendent : Webster,
We will not make them grammar schools,
but. feel that their attendance warrants
our taking a middle course. In this way
the principals will receive JloO per "month,
just as intermediate grammar schools
were established by the last board." ;. . '
The Board of Public Works yesterday
appointed P. M. Wellin to be inspector of
repairs to public buildings. Mr. Wellin
will serve one day in order to test the as
sumption by the Board of Public Works
of the duty of making repairs to school
houses, which are paid for out of the
common school fund. This course has
been opposed by Superintendent "Webster
and the courts will bo called on to decide
the disputed point. The Board Of Edu
cation will meet this morning to sign
Wellln's demand for one day's pav and
will join with the Board of Works In hav
ing the controversy over school repairs
settled at once. â¢

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 1.â James H. Eckels,
ex-Comptroller of the Currency, addressed
a large audience in Music Hall . to-night
on the Issues of the present campaign.
He declared that trusts or vast aggrega
tions of capital were good things for the
country, in . that they benefit the country
by lessening the cost of staple articles to
the individual. The profit to the manu
facturer will, he contended, with the
cheapened cost, increase. He said he did
not know of- a public man who had
achieved success who would defend illegal
combinations of capital, but that he did
know of many; men of large business ex
perience, many of prominence in the stu
dent world of student life, who not only
approved of large aggregations of capital
but were ready to defend them/ Mr. Eck
els defended banks and other money loan
ing corporations.

ed my reports to headquarters in .Wash
ington. -The -political situation as it ap
pears to- Trie. in Manila is'of stirring Inter
est. Everj'body talks 6f the present cam
paign; and of nothing else. The best in
formed hold that if McKinley Is re-elected
the .Filipinos will submit to; the present
government and cease all their efforts. at
rebellion. A great number of the Filipinos
are under the Impression that if. W. J.
Bryan is elected he- and his adrniristraticrt
will immediately withdraw all troops from,
the islands and leave. the country- entlrely
to native rule. While there- 13 no yerlous
trouble down In tha Philippines there ia a
sort of bushwhacking campaign' belr.g car
ried ion. The natives believe that'by.car
rying- on the warfare they" -are. : creating:
.sympathy In the United States.-. I. dis
cussed the mattef at much .length tv'lth
prominent merchants In Manila, an^l they
are unanimous in the opinion that If Mc-

tives will quit nil hostilities, as their last
hope will be gone,- ' . . .".â¢-.Â¦ j â¢ ;/-.-. â¢ ' Â¦ :Â¦
"Manila seemsto be doing a grand conv
: merciat business, and the wholesale ana
retail- districts present a solid substantial
mercantile appearance; .There is no ques
tion in my mind that the Philippines are
valuable possessions for us. The country
is rich and there will be. wonderful . op
portunities as soon as the natives quit
fighting and allow capital to> go Inand4ks
tablish substantial industries. The cli
mate is not a bad one. It Is a little trying
at first, but you soon get used to it. I
met a.nunaber that had come from the
States to Manila and had resided there
more than two years and had never had
a day's illness. The soldiers are ecattered
all over the islands in small groups I
saw very little sickness among them- in

THE meeting of the Business Men's

as Â¦ one of the speakers put it.
the rnon rrmarkablÂ«> gathering
ever held In that historic building. Lons
before the hour .<e-t for the â¢ event
every peat on the .floor of the bboJM
was occupied and but. few vacant ones
were left in the gallery. On the plat
form, beneath a device forming the words,
"Non-Partisan Ratification Meeting."' sat
some of San Francisco's most prominent
bnsi&ess men. and the audience was com
posed of a class generally designated as
"sol'd." Ko less remarkable was the en
thusiasm -nhich burst forth almost con
tinually, but reached a particular pitch of
fervency at any reference to President
MrKir.ley, Julius Kahn or the flag. Prior
to Mr. Kahn's. address Alfred C. Ru'ofson,

Although every rpcaker on the pro

the meeting evidently centered on the

the signal for prolonged and hearty ap

GEORGE A. KNIGHT delivered his
first speech In : San Francisco
since the opening of the . cam
.PRlem at Saratoga Hall last night.
It was a great address, full of
sledge-hammer argument and pitiless
logic, which made no apologies for tha
severity of its conclusions.. The largi
audience was frequently stirred to bursts^
of enthusiastic applause. â¢â¢â¢'-Â¦Â¦ . .
The meeting was held under tho aus
pices of the Continental League. Frank
D. Worth called the meeting to order and
introduced Benjamin L. McKinlay as
chairman of the evening. After several
songs by the Rough Rider Quintet R, II.
Schwartzkopf was introduced and spoke
briefly in favor of the Stanford Univer
sity constitutional amendment. Congress
man Eugene F. Loud made a short ad
dress.
Knight made the principal address of
the meeting. He spoke for nearly two
hours. He said in part:
Indies and gentlemen: I have traveled some
what over California and have a right so near
election day to eay that I bÂ»lie.ve the Repub
lican party was never In better condition for
victory. I have never found audiences so much
like a jury agreed upon a verdict before the
lawyers began to speak. In this campalga
there is a sort of eplrlt of 'Well, I've made up
my mind. If you've got anything to say I
will listen.' There Is a well defined Repub
lican sentiment throiiehout the State which no
one can criticize and no one can gainsay.
The reason for it 13 sufficient. You have
heurd of Americans in foreign lands going to
the British Consuls for relief when in trouble.
You've heard peÂ°P Ie criticize American courts
and saying you could get no Justice here.
You've heard people say the white ships of
our navy were a useless expense, and so we
have gone along: crying down our own in
stitutions.
There came the destruction of the Maine,
and our boys aboard that battleship were
wafted into eternity. Every man. woman and
child awoke that morning with the cry' "Re
member the Maine." One man alone remained
firm and just and calm, and that man was
Prerldent McKlnley. I was in the House and
heard Bailey of Texas demand war. He was
the leader of the minority insistent upon war.
The whole country began to criticize the Presi
dent for his delay. Goncress unanimously
tlve in Congress Is called upon to do. this is
work that so long: as I am your Representative
I shall seek to have you ask me to perform.
I love my city and my State. I wont to see
them take a foremost place in the Union and
the world.
We. of thli gre3t State, are far removed from
the older SÂ»atr6 of the East. Perhaps there is
one lesson we m'cht learn from them, that of
keeping our representatives continually In Con
gress. . -
Maine has done this. She wields therefrom
more power than any ether State In the. Union.
A man cannot be chosen chairman of any im
portant committee in his first term, nor yet in
his second. lie has got to be known.
Men retire from Congress, fresh ones are
elected in their places, many changes take
rlace. and it is only In his second or third
terra that a Congressman begins to wield
power. About thirty men in Congress do this.
They virtually govern the nation. See what
Dor/er you have when you get to be one of
these thirty.- :
I am afraid my friends have, exargerated
what I have accomplished. Anything I may
have done has simply been my duty.
Mr. Kahn opened his evening's speaking
last night with a short speech at the Po
trero Opera-house. A large and enthusias
tic audience greeted the orator, who ad
dressed them in a practical talk on the
work he had accomplished during his
term in Congress. Three cheers were giv
en for Mr. Kahn as he left the hall.
Others who addressed the meeting were:
E. Myron Wolf, Richard J. Welch. W. J.
Kvalt and John Duller.
At Saratoga Hall a largo audience greet
ed Mr. Kahn, and listened attentively to
his speech, which was freely applauded.
He spoke in part as follows:
We are drawing: to the close of a campaign
which has been a remarkable one. And now
comes a new Issue. The Republican party is
in favor of Chinese immigration say our op
ponents. To show how the administration feeln
In the matter 1 need only draw your attention
to the stand It is taking: in It. I called on
Secretary of State Hay before I left Washing
ton. I told him that the Japanese and Chinese
were entering the State to the great damage
of our labor market. He said as socn as Con
ixess was ready to enact such a law he stood
ready to carry it out.
Our friends on the other side say that "good
luck" brought about the present prosperity. It's
good luck that comes when the Republican
party is In power and bad luck when a Demo
crat holds the reins. Let us keep the good luck.

The uniform of the American army Is a badge
of honor, and no man has the riarht to wear
the shoultler straps, of a colonel except he ap
preciate the high meaning of his position. One
mar.. w. J. â¢ Bryan, wore the uniform â did he
serve, because of an honest sympathy with our
cause, or did he do it for political buncombe?
Did he. purpose to wear a tin sword and ride a
wooden horsÂ«? Did he intend, as he puts It.
to shoot civilization into the Cubans and Fili
pinos? Was he honest when he took the oath. I
or did he attempt to deceive the people, look

to shoot liberty into some one. .or else, he is a

Into your presence. The most solemn of con
tracts Is the treaty between nations. Conflicts
arise between peoples, wars . are . waged and

It is a curious coincidence that In Httle

gle for the inheritance, a similar fate Im
pending over- the Austrian branch of the

had faced the painful prospect of the dis
memberment of the vast body of Haps- :
burg dominions unless he could pledge the
different powers of Europe to respect his
formal recognition of bjs daughter. Maria
Theresa, as his successor. He accom

but it was an age when the obligation of
solemn treaties counted little against the
opportunity for. territorial aggrandize

thing, for. as the Prussian publicist.
Baron Bielfeld.' declared: "In questions of
policy one must divest oneself ofthe the
oretical Idea common people have about
Justice, frankness, fairness and the other
virtues of nations and rulers. At bottom
it is merely a question of might." It Is
then perhaps not so much of. a surprise as
a shock to the common sense of right and
wrong to see Frederick, the young King
of Prussia, within three days after the
news of the Emperor's death reached his
ears, make up his mind to pounce upon

vindication of obsolete claims.- If . wan,

Several big bets on the Presidential

betting was for a time zy 2 to-1 ln'favor of

nioney around that last night admirers of
McKinley were offering 4 to 1, with no
takers.

McKinloy will carry this city by 2500 plu

store that McKlnlev would carry the
State by 15,000 majority. The bet was $1000
a side at oven money, in the Porter Ashe-
Julius Kahn fight the latter Is favorite at
3 to 1.
Jim Neil, the well-known turf man yes
terday took at Wolfe's cigar store all the
money that was offered against Ashe Ho
thinks Ashe is a cinch and that 3 to 1 Is
too good odds to. overlook..

Frank Devereaux. the Sacramento
sporting man, has $40u0 that he would like
to place on McKinley. Last night he was
willing to give 4 to 1 odds, but he could
get no takers. The Grand Hotel l s also a

"T" HE scandal In the office of the Clerk
1 of the Supreme Court, in which
George W. Root is bo Berlously in
volved, created a sensation yesterday in
lepal and official circles. That the noto
rious conduct of Root should have cul
minated in an expose, however, was not
a surprise, as the Clerk of the Suprema
Court, occupying: as he does a position of
the utmost responsibility under the State
government, has of late been bo reckless
that a crash seemed inevitable. It haa
been a matter of common gossip that his
extravagant life, heavy gambling and
Ferious losses have placed him at the
mercy of gamblers and money-lenders.
As a private citizen his manner of life
would -be a matter of no public concern,
but as a State officer, interested In the
affairs of the highest tribunal In the State
and Involved in matters of the deepest
concern to citizens, his wild career haÂ«
caused a great deal of apprehension and
unrc-5t.
It has been a matter of shameful noto
riety for months that George W. Root.
Clerk of the Supreme Court of California,
has been the debtor, associate .and partner
of racetrack gamblers. It has Been known
to hundreds that his unpaid and unse
cured notes, aggregating thousands of
dollar*, have been scattered over the city
and State. So deeply involved had the
Clerk of the Supreme Court become that
he had been forced to the humiliating ex
tremity of giving to a bank in Sacramento
absolute power to collect his Balary as
Clerk of the Supreme Court and permit
him to receive a email monthly pittance
upon which to live.
It is known that he has placed himself
.s=o completely at the mercy of gamblers
that he has been forced to permit them to
dictate who should be- appointed to'posi-
In order that- his Influence might be
translated lnto-dollars and cents to -the
advantage of . a single transfer company
and of himself the San Francisco Trans
fer Company was organized and he was
nade a stockholder. H> never paid for
the stock he received and imposed upon
J. J. Gaffney, Â¦ another member of the
company, for a hurried loan of $513. Still
another member of the Â¦ company, and
also a creditor of Root. Is A. M. Duncan,
to whose brother Root has given a posi
tion as deputy. A relative of Prank
Daroux. the racetrack pambier and pool-

A novel development of the moving plat
form Idea is fathered by John Perry, pres
ident of the English Institution of Elec
trical Engineers, to permit passengers to
alight from and to board moving trains.
The suggestion. Is to have at each station
a turntable about 500 feet In diameter,
â¢which Is kept continuously revolving at a
speed at the rim equal to that of the mov
ing train. As described In the Electrical
"World digest, at the center there would
be a spiral staircase, by means of which
the platform could bÂ© reached. The speed
at this point would, of course, be very
moderate, but as the passenger -walked
toward the rim the speed would gTadual
ly Increase, "until at the edge he Is travel-
Ing at the rate of the moving trains
which appear to be at reat and with the
doors open. He enters, and as the movine
platform is left behind the doors are auto
matlcally closed until the next station is
reached, when they are automatically
opened again." It is suggested that with
such a system it might be expedient to
have continuous trains on such roada a^
the London underground, or the W
York elevated, when a passenger woiTm
always find a car waiting tl?Sm wYlS
the door open. â¢ lul

"WHEAT â Liverpool was firmer, -with sellers
asking an advance. It was a holiday In
Paris. New York declined lc.
Chicago was weaker, lower cables acting as a
damper on the market. There was moderate
activity at the decline. The market was In
yuch shape, however, that any rise abroad
would meet with a quick response. Primary
receipts were 622,000 bushels, but there were
heavy sales of Flour. It was thought that the
market would be of a scalping character
until the situation In the Argentine became
better known.
In this market futures fell back, but spot
quotations were unchanged.

PARALYZED FROM

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Nov. I,
A misunderstanding between brothers,
which was quickly adjusted, caused the
filing of a startling document by Moses
Salinger, one of the members of the firm
of Salinger Brothers, against his brother,
Albert M. Salinger, for an accounting, and
for a brief time the store was in thÂ«
charge of Romuldo H. Romo as receiver.
The difficulty was not due to the financial
condition of the firm, which operates the
largest department store in Oakland, but
through a disagreement, in Its turn tho
outgrowth of a misunderstanding between
Albert M. Salinger and Moses Salinger.
The suit was filed by Moses Salinger,
through his attorneys, Jamea H. Budd
and Kugene F. Bert. The complaint sets
forth the formation of Salinger Brothers
in 1878, and says that since lsyo the books
of the firm have not been posted and that
between $20,000 and $21,000 is due Moses
Salinger from his brother. Small details
are then allegedâ that Albert P.I. Salinger
has drawn more out of the business than
Moses Salinger, and the prayer is that a
receiver be appointed and that an ac
counting be had. Acting upon the docu
ments In the case Judge Ogden appointed
Mr. Romo receiver, with bonds fixed at
IW.OOO.
There was a conference between the
brothers this afternoon and an amicable
agreement was reached, ivioses Salinger
went to San Francisco to consult with his
attorneys as to tha dismissal of the suit.
Albert M. Salinger to-night gave the fol
lowing statement,, which shows the mis
understandings that have arisen:
"The trouble Is all due to a misunder
standing. My brother would never have
commenced this suit against me If he
had known what he knows now. There
are a great many things about this busi
ness of ours that he does not know about.
He is a good business man, but he doe3
not bother his head about the details. The
business has always stood in my name.
I brought mv brother out from the Kast
years ago and gave him an Interest In the
business. We have always divided the
profits. If there were any business trans
actions, however, or real estate deals,
they were carried out in my name to save
r "In this matter there have been outside
influences. I don't know what they are,
but some one has led him to believe that
he has been getting the worst of it. He
listened to stories and they became mag
nified. Now he is sorry. He announced
to me this afternoon .that the suit would
be withdrawn and went over to the city
to-night to see what could be done."
All Differences Are Very
Quickly and Amicably
Adjusted.

MOB TRIES TO PREVENT SPEECH
Senator Hanna Has a Lively Time In
a Big Circus Tent.
CHICAGO, Nov. 1.â Senator Hanna
bowed to a storm of hisses, catcalls and
cheers for Bryan in the big circus tent at
Halstead and Thirtieth streets to-night,
piving up his attempt to get a hearing un
til the 'police had restored order. For
forty-five minutes the mob had its inning
and then seventy policemen took a hand
and cleared the aisles.
Before Senator Hanna arrived speeches
by Judge Yates and other? had been ac
corded a mixed reception by the large
crowd congregated beneath the tent.
When Senator Hanna stepped upon the
platform and was introduced a demon
stration ensued which, instead of subsid
ing after a few moments, continued with
full vigor. The Senator wnited patiently
for quiet to be restored, but, appreciating
that apparently a plan to prevent him
from speaking was being carried out by
groups of men and boys stationed in the
audience, made the attempt anyway.
"There is not a man under this canvas,"
paid Senator Hanna, "who would like to
be called a traitor or a violator of the
principles upon which our Government is
founded. One of these principles is that
which favors free speech. All we ask Is
to be given the consideration which you
would ask for yourselves."
Here Senator Hanna had to frlve up the
attempt to f=peak and Sheriff Magerstadt
demanded of the police authorities that
order be restored; When every one had
been compelled to sit down and some of
the ringleaders among the disturbers ex
pelled from the meeting, John M. Harlan
of Chicago quieted the crowd with a story
and talked briefly of the issues of the
campaign. When he had concluded Sena
tor Hanna resumed his speech and fin
ished Â¦without Interruption.

Dedication; "Bricks Without Straw," R. B..
OAKLAND. Nov. 1.â The co-ed edi
tion of the Occident made Its ap
pearance to-day, and has proved
a success, financially, artistically
and in every way. The edition
has been almost exhausted, and the young
ladies, with penuine business acumeti. are
preparing to issue another. It has proven
that the co-eds have a well-developed
financial instinct, for the advertising paid
all of the expenses and the proceeds of the
sale represent the profits. The girls
doubled the size and changed the style of
the magazine. That they took advantage
of all opportunities is shown by the num
ber of candidates' announcements which
appeared in the advertisements. The drift
of co-ed inclinations may be pathered
from the fact that the issue contains five
pages of sports, four pages of prose liter
ature, three pages of poetry, not quite two
pages of editorial, five pages devoted to
college societies and news, one page to the
new gymnasium, two paees. of miscellany
and fourteen pages of advertising. These
are the two leading editorials:
THR DEDICATION".
It seems especially appropriate that this
Issue of the Occident should be dedicated to
Mr*. Whaler, who. since her mmtns, has taken
such a deep Interest in the women of the uni
versity, lending her pr'-sence rraciously to all
our little functions and throwing h*r home
O|w>n *ach week to us. In every way phÂ«> has
sli'.wn how completely her heart Ib centered
here. V.'e strive, therefore, to show our deen
gratitude.
WHAT WE THINK.
We hear a Kreat deal in an adverse way
theÂ«e days about â¢Â¦co-education" and the "pres
ence of the co-ed," and It Is rather surprising
thst the trnmen of the university take this
ciiticitm so kindly. Two things, however, con
duce to the toleration: Firstly, such remarks
usuallyâ we may say alwaysâ sprinK from an
exreeflinRly frephmanistlc source, and are the
echoes of things the High School van heard
before matriculating from its precursor of the
year before; secondly, we know that no other
university in the whole world has such gen
erous women behind It. This thought should
bring a blush of shame to the cheek of any
university man who presumes to contest the
campus with us. So there!

I^ONDOX, Nov. 2.â The stew-ards of the
jockey club have irsued a siKnificant no
tice that !n \iew of the large number of
horses now in training at Newmarket
they: are not prepared to entertain any
Â¦freeh-! applications for licences to train
th^re.- Â¦ â¢ Â¦ .
Rigby, the American Jockey, has been
suspended by the Jockey club for a fort
blg'ht for drawing overweight in the Old
CambridKeshire race. He has also tK-en
reprimanded for using "improper lan
.Ruaro" in th?' weighing room.
. The. report of the proceeding's at the last
meetine of the jockey club, held October
2*i which imp just t>Â«Â»*>n Issued, shows rlsat
a Iorig discussion took place over James
LowUier's amendment proposing to ex
cludÂ» foreigners fmm the allowances
i-lHtmable bv apprentices. Mr. Lowiher
frankly admitted that it was aimed Rt
American lac's and tho abuses of wmen
Lord DurnaTTi ha-l camplained.
The Duke of Devonshire, the Earl of
Crews ?nd otl orÂ« opposed the amendment,
which Ava^ ftn-illy rejected.
Lord Durham intr.xiu^od a motion in
favor of limiting tho Dumber of horses
training at NewmarKft. "\\ ltn the
Americans." he said. "Newmarket IS em
inently fnÂ«-hionabl<\ I suppose they think
it the hub of the universe. Hut I sna.l
Object if they are to ue allowed to come
in 'unlimited numbers, for Englishman will
He driven away."
The Prince of Wales, who took a lively
interest in the discussion, said that unless
they made some hard ami fast rule he
eculd not see how it was possible to pre
vent more people from coming. Ho
thought they should apjxiint a committee
to inquire with regard to the number of
horses and a number not to be augment
ed. He observed that, he had listened
with grout attention to what had fallen
from Lord Durham .inti he auite under
stood the obiect to be kept in view. Ixird
Durham's remarks, as he (the Prince) in
terpreted them, wero not addressed
acair.st anybody in particular, hut against
the whole s\atem in general, the desire
being n,ot to have more horses and train
ers than they have at present.
"The subject is one 6l such great diffi
culty, and. I need scarcely say. of such
gravity, " continued the Prince of Wales,
"that I cannot help thinking it quite im
piÂ«iblÂ» that the stewards Â«hr.uld have
the responsibility of devising any scheme
without seeking advice elsewhere, and I
venture to pusrgrest that they should ap
point a committee to inquire into tha
matter, after which they could bring the
whole matter again before the club."
Some further discussion was had and
a committee such as the Prince of Wales
had suggested was appointed. It includes*,
in addition to the steward? of the Jockey
Club. I/ord Durham. Prinze Demitri Solty
koff. I^elpold de Rothschild and others.
Th*> stewards have delivered their ver
dict in the darehaven-Spertrum case
They exonerate Mr. Nciman and Gllpin
the trainer, from any intentional wrong
doing, but express the opinion that " in
regard to the form shown by Clar^haven
at Epsom it was undesirable to start her
partly fit after an interval of a few
weeks."

Â¥ T NCLE SAM'S army transport
I 1 Sherman did not set away on
I I time yesterday. She was booked
to sail at noon, and it is rarely or
1 Â¦ "ever that Captains Batchelder and
Barneson hold the vessels. On this occa
sion, however, they could not help them
selves. One of the lady passengers forgot
her trunks and these had to be secured.
They were out at the corner of Polk~and
California streets, and it took an hour and
ten minutes to bring them to the wharf.
What Captain Batchelder said during that
seventy, minutes would not look well in
print. Captain Barneson was his own
cool, collected s-elf, and if he did any fum
ing nobody knew anything/ about it.; The
Sherman took away the usual consign
ment of recruits, surgeons, hospital nurses
and army officers' wives.
"China has a great deal to learn from
this young republic. I hope, however,
that she will learn, not the arts of war,
which have for sole end and aim the de
struction of life, but the arts of peace,
Â¦which make for the happiness ana wel
fare of the people. No nation can become
really great by war. True greatness does
not lie in the extent of territory .nor
strength of battalions, but in the charac
ter of the people. From personal observa
tion I am inclined to the belief that the
American people possess the elements of
national greatness in a high degree. The
test of loftiness of character is to pos
sess boundless power without abusing it.
"Wealth Is power. "Where can you rind
such vast accumulations of wealth In
private hands as in America, with so lfi
tle attendant evil felt by society? I have
seen countries where-the rich oppress the
poor and the poor curse the rich. There
â¢money Is the root of all evil." The re
verse seems to be the case in America.
Here the rich use the ample means at
their disposal for the benefit of the peo
ple and the people have good reason to
bless the rich. In other words, American
men of wealth are public benefactors. I
have not tar to go for an example. In
your midst you have a signal instance of
this class of philanthropic men of wealth.
This institution is an enduring monument
of the founder's munitlcence. Here one
can find the most effective means for the
enlightening of the mind and the uplift-
Ing of the soul. Books, paintings anil
sculpture and specimens of objects pos
sessing educational value are accessible
to all persons at all times. The day will
soon come when foreigners will visit this
city, not so much to see the great indus
trial establishments as to see this insti
tution, which spreads its refining influence
far and wide. This city will be equally
famous for & great educator as for a
manufacturing center. May this standing
monument of the founders benefaction
stimulate others to follow this noble ex
ample. May the 'founder's day," which I
heartily join with you in celebrating, be
ever observed from year to year as an
event of national interest."

Jeremiah Daily Appointed to Succeed the
Late Captain H. T. Emery.;
JEREMIAH DAILY was yesterday
appointed â¢ secretary of the , Mer
chants' Exchange, succeeding the
late Captain H. T. Emery. The
appointment meets with the genuine'
approval of every merchant and ship
owner, as during his years of continuous
service Mr. Dally has made only friends.
Under Captain Shotwell and again under
Captain Emery he acted as chief clerk
and always with satisfaction to his su
periors and the members of the exchange
generally.
'Abe Marks, who has been the statisti
cian of the exchange for years, succeeds
Mr. Dally as chief clerk, while either J.
J. McDevitt or W. Downs will step Into
Mr. Marks' shoes, j There is therefore a
change all around and no one begrudges
the boys their promotion. "Jerry,"
"Abe," "Will" and "Mac" are known
from one'end of the coast to the other and
wherever a Ban Francisco owned vessel
drops her anchor, there they have a
friend. While all mourned the loss of
Captain Emery, as they mourned the loss
of Captain Shotwell, still it will not make
their good wishes for the living any. the
less hearty.

To Change Livestock Freight Bate.
William Sproule,. freight traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific, returned yester
day from Denver, where he attended a
meeting of the Trans-Missouri Freight
Bureau. The most, important question
discussed was the propriety of ; making
the freight rates on livestock ln cents per
100 pounds instead of In dollars per car
The matter was left with a special com
mittee for final settlement.

Way down in Kentucky there is a
woman who wanta $50 out of the small
fortune left by the well-known horseman,
Thomas Keating. Keating was unmar
ried and to protect his heirs from pos
sible impostors he bequeathed $50 to any
woman that might prove herself his
widow. This clause . ln the will got
somewhat twisted ln transmission from
Oakland, where the will was filed, to the
East, so that when It appeared ln a St.
Louis paper It read as follows:
! SAN FRANCISC6, Oct. 24.â Thomas Keating,
the horse owner, : whosa will was filed ln Oak
land to-day, leaves $50 for any. widows that
may appear. The deceased left an estate of
about $50,000. . Â¦.â¢;,.:âÂ¦.Â¦-' ,,, .
i County Clerk Deane was astonished yes
terday to receive an application for the
$50 from Widow Thompson of Paducah,
Ky. Widow ; Thompson construed the St
Louis newspaper report literally, and. be
ing a widow, decided to appear. Her ap
pearance, as humorous as it Is pathetic
is contained ln the following letter:

During the past year Mack & Co.,
wholesale druggists at 13 Fremont street,
have been systematically robbed of drugs
valued at several thousand dollars. Fall
ing to discover the culprits the proprietors
employed a private detective agency to
assist them, as it was evident that the
work was being done by somebody who
was in the employ of the company.
In seme way the action of the druggists
in enlisting the services of the detectives
became known and the wholesale thefts
suddenly stopped. Suspicion was- direct
ed, however, to a young man named Ike
Muller, who was wont to tread the prim
rose path, and who at one time was em
ployed by the firm. Muller learned that
the detectives were after nlm and pacKed
his grip and left the city.
About three weeks ago two hundred
ounces of cocaine, worm $1400, were se
cretly taken from a locker ln .the store,
together with some other drugs. The
manager of the company after learning
of the theft went to poll's headquarters
and enlisted the services of Captain of
.Detectives Seymour Ln running aown the
culprits. After an investigation Seymour
was convinced that the Job was done by
somebody connected with the establish
ment and he detailed Detective Tom Gib
son on the case.
Gibson learned that the cocaine .had
been given to* two young men named Dave
Davis, who Is employed in a cigar store
on Dupont street, and William H. Geran,
a professional accordion player, to sell.
Gibson subsequently saw the two men
standing at Bush street and Grant avenue.
Concealing himself in a doorway he
awaited developments. Presently he no
ticed Geran pass Davis a package, and
together they walked down the street.
The detective followed them to a drug
store on Powell street, where they sold
twelve ounces of the drug for $48, being
Â£6 leas than the market price.
As the two men left the store they were
placed under arrest and taken to the City
Prison, where their names were regis
tered on the "small" book.
Geran after being locked up sent for
Gibson and made e. complete confession.
He implicated two employes of the com
pany, who will be arrested to-day. Muller,
who Is at present In La Grande, Or., will
also be prosecuted. A dispatch was Bent
ast night to the police of La Grande ask
ing them to hold him until a warrant can
be issued for his arrest. Both the pris
oners accuse Muller of obtaining drugs
from the storo for them to sell. They say
that the stuff was stolen by two of the
employes and passed to Muller, who on
account of having worked for the com
pany was given the privilege of visiting
the store. He would then meet Geran and
Davis and tell them to sell the stolen
drugs for whatever prico they could get.
Muller exacted two-thirds of the amount
realized on the stuff, while the remainder
went to Geran and Davis. The police have
already recovered about $1500 worth of
cocaine and other drugs taken from the
store. They expect to recover some more
to-day.
Muller. who. It is claimed, is one of the
arch conspirators, is a brother of Joe Mul
ler. who is at the head of a theatrical
company which is playing ln Oregon. It
is believed that "Ike." for whom the po
lice are looking, is with him.

i H. E. Huntington, first vice president
of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Is ex
pected to arrive in this city any day now
from the East. He left New York City
last week to visit his old home ln Oneonta,
N. Y.. It has been reported that C. M.
Hays, the prospective new president of
the Southern Pacific, would accompany
Mr. Huntington to the coast, but no In
formation to that effect has been received
by any of the local officials of the com
pany. It is more probable that Mr. Hays
will wait until the first of the year
before coming out here, aa his new duties
will begin at that time.
It seems to be pretty well understood
that Mr. Huntington will resign as first
vice president with the beginning of the
year. Mr. Huntington has, for some time
past, expressed a desire to be relieved of
much of the executive work that has
fallen upon him since the death of Collis
P. Huntington.. The nephew of the late
president was the latter's right hand man
for a long time and what little he was
not called upon to do while Collis P.
Huntingdon was alive he has had to look
after since his death.
As president of the Market Street Rail
way Company Mr. Huntington will have
quite enough "to occupy his attention -when
not attending to the affairs of the Hunt
ington estate and some extensive petro
leum interests.
J. C. Stubbs, third vice president, will
naturally take Mr. Huntington"s place as
first vice president. Mr. Stubbs has been
general traffic manager for fifteen years,
and ln 18S9 he was given the title of third
vice president. The office of second vice
president has been vacant since the pro
motion of C. H. Tweed as chairman of the
board of directors
There is a feeling that Mr. Hays will
do away with the titles of third and
fourth vice presidents, as these offices
have amounted to little more than the
name since they were created. Julius
Kruttschnitt, who Is the fourth vice presi
dent, would probably be brought up to
second vice president, continuing, as at
present, to be general manager. William
H. Mills, land agent of the- company, and
who was formerly vice president of the
Central Pacific, Is said to be slated for
third vice president.
That Mr. Hays will follow an economic
policy goes without saying If his manage
ment of the Grand Trunk road Is any
criterion. It has never been Mr. Hays'
policy to cut salaries. On the contrary,
he is Inclined to raise them. His method
of keeping down expenses is to consoli
date offices and weed out some posi
tions that have long since become sine
cures.
A prominent business man, who has Just
returned from the East and who is a
warm friend of the new president, said
yesterday that he would not be at all
surprised If Hays brought several well
known Eastern railroad workers to the
coast with him. He was almost certain
that F. H. SIcGuigan, general superin
tendent of the Grand Trunk, would be
given a position under Hays, as the two
nave long been closely related with one
another ln the railroad business. Mc-
Guigan was appointed to his present po
sition through Mr. Hays, who took him
from the Wabash. where he was super
intendent of the Western division. Mc-
Guigan was born in Cleveland and is Just
â¢40 years old.
SCHEDULE NOT SATISFACTORY.
Southern Pacific's Employes Will Not
Get What They Ask.
Manager J. A. Fillmore spent the great
er part of yesterday listening to the
twenty-five delegates who are here from
the Southern Pacific's various divisions
for the purpose of securing a revision of
the conductors', brakemen's and yard
men's working schedule. There is much
detail work to be gone over, and Cnair
man Stafford stated last evening that It
may take another week to settle the mat
ter. The schedule takes in over 5000 miles
of road.
Assistant Manager Foster said yester
day that there were a number of items
embodied in the revised schedule which
the company could not accept. "We are
willing to be fair with our men," said he
"but if we give them all they asked it
wouldn't take long to bankrupt the road.
I do not think a strike would result, even
though we declined to accept any part of
the new schedule. The men have had one
experience with a strike, and I don't be
lieve they want anpther."
Acetylene Gas for Headlights.
Acetylene gas is being substituted for oil
by the Southern Pacific Company for use
in illuminating Its engine headlights. The
mechanical department of the Santa Fe
Is now making experiments with the gas
to determine its utilltyfor headlight pur
poses. General Manager Kruttschnitt
stated yesterday that the Southern Pacific
had found the gas preferable to oil, al
though its use had not yet been brought
down to a thoroughly practical basis. The
gas throws a very vivid light, which is
much more penetrating than the oil Illu
mination. Some fifteen of the Southern
Pacific engines are now equipped with the
new style light.
