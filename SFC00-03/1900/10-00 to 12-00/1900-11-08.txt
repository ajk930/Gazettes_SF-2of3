.Whatever excitement â¢ there was yes
teiday In the city over the election was
confined to . the - office lot - the Registrar.
The people of the city generally had re
turned to their ordinary, occupations. Now
and again some interest. was created by
the ludicrous street scene of some one
paying an election bet, .but however ab
sued the debtors of nonsense made them
selves, little attention -was paid to them.
In the purely local field there was but
one close contest, and this was spirited
enough to overshadow for a time affairs
of greater Importance. This contest was
that between Dalngerfleld and Graham
for Superior Judge. < which Graham has
won by the extremely narrow margin of
386 votes, leaving out of consideration the
Twelfth Precinct of the' Forty-flfth
Assembly District. Even were Dalnger
fleld to receive the complete vote of this
precinct, which he did not, he would not
be elected. It is. probable, however, that
be 'will make a contest.
In the Legislative field the one topic of
congratulatory comment, In addition to
the Republican success, was the over
whelming s "defeat of Henry C. Dibble In
the Forty-first Assembly District. It was
the general opinion yesterday that the
disaster to Dibble's campaign was the
end of his political career.
The percentage of registered votes cast
yesterday . was 88.09. In 1S96 the percent
age was S8.78 and In 1888 It was 87.77. The
registration this year. was 73,623, and the
number of votes cast was 64,863. Of these
the highest Elector : on the Republican
ticket, S. M. Shortrldge, received 35,112
and the highest Electoron the Democratic
ticket." J. H. Seawell, received 25.151. giv
ing a Republican plurality of 9961 votes.
office from daylight until dark. It was
regrettable that some of the election offi
cers were either negligent or inefficient
and the returns in some precincts were de
layed or misplaced. Messengers were sent
with all haste after the derelicts and at
last all but one precinct, the Twelfth oi
the Forty-fifth Assembly District* was ac
counted for an-1 the results of. the election
were tabulated. The missing district In
the unofficial returns cannot be counted
until the official count is made. There
will be no change In the result, however,
as the Twelfth Precinct of the Forty-fifth
District has only 250 registered votes,
which would not change the status of
any candidate In the closest contest.

SAN FRANCISCO has enrolled
herself among the banner Repub
lican, cities of the American
Union. The unofficial returns of
the election, with the exception
of a single precinct, have been completed
and show that McKinley and Roosevelt
have carried the city over Bryan and Ste
venson with a plurality of 9961 votes.
Never before has the city recorded such
a splendid Republican triumph. On this
tremendous wave of success many other
Republicans have been carried. Out of
eighteen Assemblymen elected in the city
fourteen are Republicans; of five State
Senators chosen four are Republicans.
Both Republican Congressmen recelvea
'an enormous vote, Julius Kahn winning
in the Fourth District by a plurality of
5300 votes and Eugene F. Loud receiving a
plurality of 4500 votes in that part of the
Fifth Congresional District which Is in
San Francisco. The success which attend
ed national. Congressional and Legisla
tive nominees marked the fortunes of
others. The Republicans won three out of
the five Superior Judges and the five Jus
tices of the Peace who were elected are
all Republicans. This in outline is the
contribution which San Francisco made
on Tuesday to the national Republican
triumph.
Although the results In most contests
were known yesterday morning, excite
ment reigned all day at the office of the
Registrar. Anxious candidates and ex
citable friends of candidates thronged the
Judge Daingerfield Defeated by Graham Jn
an Exceptionally Giose and Ex
citing Contest.
The City Gives to McKinley a Plurality of
More Than Nine Thousand Nine
Hundred.
SAN FRANCISCO'S
GIFT OF VOTES
Chairman LIndsey of the Republicans
claims to-night that McKinley carried the
State by 7000 or more, the Republican
State ticket wins by 5000 to 7000, and that
the Republicans have a majority of 17 in
the Legislature. Republicans claim elec
tion of Mercer and Burkett for Congress
and election of Pope, Moreland and pos-
Ftbly Hays. Against this the Democrats
claim Bryan hns carried the State, though
by a narrow margin of perhaps not over
a thousand; that the Fuslonlsts have a
safe working' majority In the Legislature;
that Fusion State officers have been elect
ed by 3000 to 5000, and that, conceding the
election of Mercer and Burkett, Fusion
has pulled through Robinson, Stark,
Shallenberger and Neville. The latter is
the only Fusion Congressman conceded by
the Republicans. The Legislature will bo
in doubt until complete returns are in.
COMMITS SUICIDE
BECAUSE HE THINKS
BRYAN IS ELECTED
NEW YORK. Nov. 7.-Driven to
desperation by the report that
Bryan had been elected, a man
whose identity has not been estab
lished jumped from a Hoboken
ferryboat iast night. . and was
drowned. The ferryboat Lacka
wanna of the Fourteenth-street
line was on its 7:45 o'clock trip from
Hoboken and had reached "mid
stream, when the man climbed over
the gates and stood on the bow, of
the boat.
"Ladles and gentlemen." he be
gan, "being cure that Bryan is
elected, I might as well do it now."
He was proceeding to speak, when
Benjamin Frederickson of Hobo
ken. one of the passengers, climbed
over the gates and seized him.
The man shook himself loose and
plunged into the water, almost
dragging with him Frederickson,
who saved himself only by seizing
the gates. The suicide struck the
water directly in front of the pad
dla wheel ond was .struck by. it.
The Lackawanna was stopped and
a tugboat steamed up to aid In the
search, but the man had disappear
ed beneath the water and was not
seen again.

OMAHA, Nov. 7.â Returns in Nebraska
are so close as to be watched keenly.
It Is generally believed in Wall street
that Mr. Croker did not quit much loser
on the election for the reason that he
hedged his wagers by purchasing stocks.
He took over, it is said. 20,000 shares that
have netted him an average profit of ten
points. This leaves him with $200,000 out
of which to make good $160,000 which he
lost on Bryan.
REPUBLICAN'S CLAIM NEBRASKA
At the Hoffman House to-day It was
said that Mr. Croker placed his final
850,000 so that had fortune favored him ho
would have realized about $430,000. In
view of the result of the election Mr.
Croker may console himself that the odds
made no difference to him, as hÂ© would
have lost as heavily at even money as
he did at the longer price.
Under the weight of this money the
edds against Bryan fell to two to one,
and Mr. Crocker is believed to have fol
lowed them down the scale, placing his
money as best he could. Then came the
rally of the Republican financial strength
and the odds receded. Mr. Crocker
stopped betting when he was offered
three to one, but again reached Into his
pocket when McKinley men offered as
good as five to ope.

ThÂ£ estimates on the four missing coun

net Republican gain of about 22,000 votes
over the vote of 1S98. The Republicans
gained in 77 counties and the Democrats
in 11. Most of the Democratic gains were
in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Toledo,

vote that Mayor Jones of Toledo received

The largest previous plurality for Pres

that was on a much smaller vote than
was cast In the State this year. The total
vote in Ohio yesterday was about 1,100,000

the vote for minor parties was smaller

garding Vote in Ohio.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 7.â Democratic
State Chairman Lang had no statement
to give out to-night. Republican State
Chairman Dick said: w\
Filipino Junta In Hongkong, but Mr. Root
denied that this was so. - /
President 'McKinley will receive full re
ports from the Taft Commission relative
to the situation and Its views to-mor
row and will begin" the preparation of thi3
feature of his message. Those in position
to know predict that the President will
favor legislation under which he wiil have
authority to appoint a civil governor. Tha
Filipinos will also have an opportunity to
Â¦elect a Legislature, the idea being, it ia
understood, that the territorial govern
ment of Arizona shall be used as a model.
The military Is tired of the responsibility
and -the defeat of Bryan and the efforts
which will be made to crush the rebellion,
within the next few months j.wlll ; - have a.
powerful effect, it Js believed, upon bring
ing about a return of . peace. .:
While there is talk- of civil government
for the Filipinos, actual steps have been
taken for Increasing the army. Secretary
Root has based his estimates for the sup
port of the, army for the next fiscal year
upon a force of 100,000 men, 65.000 of whom
shall belong to the regular establishment.
The President and the -War Department
will urge upon Congress the necessity .of
enacting legislation making an Increased
army Immediately available, and the de
partment will then adopt measures for re
crultlnp and transporting to the Philip
pines the troops necessary to replace
those to be withdrawn. -
With respect to Cuba, it Is generally
conceded in official circles that no action
upon the constitution now being framed
will be taken beforÂ« the new Congress

CALL. BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Nov.
7.â Now that President McKinley
has been re-elected, Cabinet re
organization is a question of tho
first Importance in official circles here. It
Is positively asserted that Secretary of
War Root will retire. Senator Thornis
H. Carter of Montana Is spoken of a3
a member of the President's next Cabinet,
either as Secretary of War or Attorney
General. Whltelaw Reid's flame is added
to the list of those "mentioned for Secre
tary of State in the event of Mr. Hay'a
retirement.
It Is not expected that there will be
many changes in the diplomatic repre
sentation of this Government abroad.
When the re-election of the President be
came certain last night Secretary Root
cabled the fact to General MacArthur,
who circulated It by wire throughout the
Philippines. A dispatch received frota
General MacArthur late this aftcrnoo"
announced that the news. had had an ex
cellent effect upon the Filipinos, and Gen
eral MacArthur expressed the belief that
the decision of the American people to
hold the Philippines, as expressed at the
polls, would materially aid ihe military \a
suppressing the insurrection. It waa
Ftated to-day that ecretary Root had
asked the State Department to request
the British Government to suppress the
Secretary of State Hay Is expected ft>
immediately initiate negotiations for se
curing a right of way from Nicaragua
and Costa Rica for the proposed Nica
ragua canal. Determined effort will be
made to obtain canal legislation during
the coming session. Negotiations for the
acquisition of the Danish West Indies will
be pressed, as will others for the estab
lishment of coaling stations at various
points. . : . . .
The administration will make a strong
. ort , to Â°Â°taln the ratification of the re
ciprocity treaty with France, and this
precedent established; will enter Into sim
ilar arrangements with other European
nations.- Such action" will prevent the
success of tMe movement started in Ger
man y to close, \he .European, market to
American products. ' I
The State Department will also con
tinue its pressure upon Turkey for a set
tlement of the missionary claims. An of
ficial declined to say to-day whether the
Kentucky would or would not visit Turk
ish waters ito compel payment. No orders
Â£Â« v f y ?Li bec J\ lssued to the battleship
having this object in view. .
The re-election of the President is ex
pected to result In Secretary Long recom
mending a substantial Increase of the
navy. Before the election the Secretary
was indisposed to make large recom
mendations, but the necessity of a strong
addition to American warships' construc
tion, as pointed out by several officers
whose views have been sought, makes it
probable that the, Secretary will urge the
authorization of several armorclads and
gunboats.
Will Put Down Philippine Rebellion in Short .Order and Then
Begin Work on the Nicaragua Canal.
ST. PAUL. Nov. 7.â The only point un
settled in the Minnesota election is the
contest over the Governorship. Every
thing else has gone Republican oy ma
jorlt'ee so large that there Is no'possi
bility of change. Chairman Blxby figures
out S754 plurality for Vansant. while
Chairman Rosing of the.Democratlc com
mittee, from the figures reported to him
foots up 12,000 plurality for Llnd. The'
present returns have favored Vansant
but his lead Is slight. .The McKinley vote"
peems considerably more than 50.000 over
that of Bryan. However, there are vari
ous unexpected thlnps to the returns and
the Governorship will have to be called
doubtful until 'much more complete re
turns have' been received. w

The congratulatory exchange between
lhe President and Vice President elect,
.Mr. Roosevelt, is as follows:
CANTON. Nov. 7.â President McKinley
tjs u? at an early hour this morning
aftrr a shTt rest. An army of messen
gers poured in this morning bringing con
praiulatory telegrams and friends and
neighbors gathered to cfctend their con
gratulations. The President breakfastod
at 6 o'clock with Mrs. McKinley and then
went to the library, where he ran over the
morning papers and listened to the dis
patches as Secretary Cortclyou picked
them from the thousands received. Thry
rame from all quarters of the country and
:he world, many of them being from Em
liarsadors and Ministers abroad. Many
ef the members of the Cabinet had been
heard from. Senator Hanna and many of
his assistants of the I'r.ion Club of Cleve
land joined in a, message expressing their
satisfaction. All the dispatches broatheii
a spirit of personal devotion to the Presi
dent and a patriotic sense of the result.
A drizzling rain brgan to fall, but this
did not deter "big crowds from turning out
at Kast Palestine. Enon Valley, New Gal
ilee and New Brighton.
"You are here to celebrate a victory
won not by a single party, but by the
people of all parties. (Great applause.) I
go back to my public duties at the Capi
tol encouraged by your confidence, but
dcrply conscious of the grave- responsi
bilities which your action of yesterday
imposes upon me. I can only ask of all
my countrymen their sympathy and sup
port in the solution of the great problems
that rest upon the United States, and I
am sure that nil of us will humbly peti
tion the guidance of that Divine Ruler
who has never failed thif Government
through all its vicissitudes from its be
ginning to the present hour."
At IiCif onia and Columbians there were
like outbursts, crowds besieging the Pres
ident's car. No speoches were made, but
the President reached down and shook
many hands.
Ladles struggled to throw bunches of
chrysanthemums toward Mrs. McKinley.
A voting woman kept cryinp "Bryan:" in
defiant tones, but nor voice was faint
amid the din. The screech of the factory
whistles wa? deafening. The President
bowed his thanks and when order was
partly Floured he said In part:
A short distance further on the train
stopped at Sebrlng, a new town with huge
potteries built up. it is said, by the foster
ing of the American pottery interest.
Uusiness was suspended, and the work
men poured forth to Join in the hurrahs.
A big banner announced: "Sebrlng four
Â«o one for McKinley."
The President waved acknowledgments,
but did not sppak.
In the bip factory town of Salem the
s-rnokf of many stacks hung over the city,
and the myriad of worklngmen and work
ing women gave the place, the aspect of
a hive of Industry. <
A vast concourse of people lined the
tracks. The tops of freight cars were
used as point? of vantage. Little girls
bore big American flags. The drum corps
was uniformed as l : nited StateR volun

Cheered by Workingmen.
When the President appeared there were
dearening cheers, to which he bowed and

McKINLEY'S JOURNEY
ONE LONG OVATION
â¢ NEW YORK, Nov. 7. â Governor Roose
velt, although he did not retire until after
midnight, was up in good season to-day at
his home in Oyster Bay. After breakfast
he looked over many dispatches of con
gratulation. The Governor said:
"I rejoice beyond measure over the way
the vote has gone. President McKinley
had to race the most serious problems
that have been faced by any President
since Lincoln "T by any President a gen
eration before Lincoln. I do not see how
there Could have been any material Im
provement in the way he has faced and
solved each of them. It therefore seems
to be a perfectly fair test of the way
our people are willing to back up a man
who has done such difficult and all-im
portant work for the nation. I think that
the supreme capacity for successful self
eovernment In a nation Is clearly shown
by the struggle through which the nation
has just passed.
"To have failed to Indorse President Mc-
Kinley would have been a calamity com-
E arable only to / a failure to indorse
Incoln in 1864. All far-sighted and patri
otic Americans feel deeply thankful for
the way In whtqh the American people as
a whole have shown their good sense and
absolute adherence to the cause of hon
esty and national honor.
"Again, It should be a matter of the
deepest gratification at the way those
Democrats stood by soundmohey. They,
having Joined hands with their Repub
lican brethren, share the candidate for a
victory which represents far more than
any partisan victory."
Governor Roosevelt said he expected to
remain at his home in Oyster Bay for a
couple of days, when he would go to Al
bany to resume his official duties.

stitute all that W. F. Herrin has saved,
from the wreck of the Burns -Senatorial
campaign. These four men. who voted
for the railroad's candidate, have been
returned- to the .Legislature. â¢ Of the re
maining .'twenty-six several; were turr.ed
ddwn in the nominating conventions as
unworthy of public confidence. One of
them, H.""C. Dibble, was" renominated and
backed by all the influence that Herrin
could command. Two years ago Dibble
was elected to the Assembly by a major
ity of S55. Last Tuesday 'he was beaten
by % 5S5 in a, district which gave a Republi
can majority of 1272. It will be noted that
he ran more than 1200 votes behind his
ticket. The work of the Southern Pacific
political bureau should be studied by
Charles M. Hays, the new president of the
company. Herrin established special head
quarters and organized a money spending
campaign to elect Dibble In San Fran
cisco and defeat C. M. Belshaw In Alann
and Centra ccsta counties. His work was
raw and clumsy. The good coin of the
corporation wits; wasted. Clever support
ers of Belshaw were shrewd enougn to
direct the disbursement of a considerable
portion of the Herrin fund. Every move
that Herrin made was promptly check
mated. The sack bearers dispatcned from
San Francisco were welcemed at various
points in Contra Costa County. The Call
docs not intimate that Herrin was
bunkoed, but merely desires to cast the
inference that the new president of the
Southern Pacific should establish a close
season for political lobsters, so that Her
rin may be protected in the future.
Among congratulatory telegrams re
ceived from Contra Costa County Is this
one:
PINOLE. Nov. 7. 19C0.
W. S. Leake, Manager Call. San Franciscoâ
On behalf of all Belshaw's friends I thank you
sincerely for your splendid assistance. With
out you and The Call the bosses would have
beaten us. JOHN BERMINGHAM JK.
It is refreshing to n&te that the men
of the last Legislature who were true to
the cause of the people, refusing to bow
to the railroad yoke, have been rewarded
by re-election. C. M. Belshaw. A. hi.
Muenter, \V\ B. Lardner and C. B. Green
well are promoted from the Assembly to
the State Senate. Thomas Flint Jr. and
J. J. Luchslnger are re-elected to tbe
Senate, J. W. Atherton, Marin; H. W.
Brown, San Mateo: Alden Anderson, Sj

Melick, Los Angeles; G. G. Radcllff.
Santa Cruz; J. R. Knowland and J. A.
Bliss, Alameda; C. W. Merritt. Santa Bar
bara, and A. S. Milice. Riverside, are re
elected to the Assembly by large ma
jorities. For example Mr. Knowland's
plurality is 2068.
E. T. Cosper. who was elected to rep
resent Tulare and Kings County in the
last Legislature, did not dare go before
his constituents for re-election. He mo\>d
from Tulare to> Kings and got the Re
publican nomination for Superior Judge.
His evil record, however, pursued him ami
the people turned him down. Cosper caii
console himself with the knowledge that
he can keep moving on. There are coun
ties other than Kings and Tulare and
there are offices to be filled other than
those of Superior Judge and Assembly
man.
The Republicans will control both
branches of the next Legislature. Four
candidates are in the field for Speaker of

Campaign to Elect Dibble and
Defeat Belshaw.

ton, Los Angeles, anri Grove L. Johnson.
Sacramento. Members will hesitate to
consider Pendleton's aspirations as sin
cere, and for good and sufficient reasons
Johnson cannot muster many supporters.
The contest for the Speakerahlp is practi
cally narrowed down to Alden Anderson
and F. E. Dunlap. Both are capable
legislators of experience and integrity,
and no mistake would be made in the
election of either.
It appears that the Republicans ha\e
elected nineteen of the twenty new Sena
tors. Fifteen of the hold-overs are Re
publican, hence the party has thirty-four
of the forty Senators. Returns indicate
that the Assembly will contain fifty-seven
Republican members. The only Demo
cratic Senator elected is Joseph M. Plun
kett of the Seventeenth Senatorial Dis
trict. He was indorsed by the Citizens'
Republican party and supported by ThÂ»
Call for the reason that his opponent was
a rank exponent of boasism and the par
ticular pet of Martin Kelly and W. F.
Herrin.
Phelan is not thought of as a Senatorial
possibility. The mere mention of the face
ihat Phelan was favorably disposed t.
ward a candidate for State Senator cau?- <i
much uneasiness and aiarm to the friend Â¦Â»
of such candidate. The almost unanimoi; |
election of the Republican Senators is ;i
direct turn clown and defeat of Phelan'.;
cherished scheme to place the harbor
front under city jurisdiction, a plank lead-
Ing up to which Phelan had inserted In
the Democratic State platform of the Sa:i
Jose convention.
The defeat of Judge Daingerfleld is an
other Instance of the unpopularity of Ph-:
ian. who had staked his politicat reputa
tion on the election of this Judse. It i-Â»
to be regretted that a just and worthy
Judge should be thus sacrificed and con
signed to private iife. but the ballon
show that the anti-Phelan sentiment is
so firm and strong in this city that it Is
but necessary to make known the friend
ship and support of Phelan and his or
ganization In order to insure pÂ« sitive de
feat for any candidate so favored.

Generally Overlooked.
Many things may cause deafness, ami
very often it is difficult to trace a cause.
Some people Inherit deafness. Acute dls-
easea like scarlet fever sometimes caus>Â»
deafness. But by far the most common
cause of loss of hearing is catarrh of tho
head and threat.
A prominent specialist on ear troublea
gives as his opinion that nine out of ten
cases cf deafness are traced to throat
trouble; this Is probably overstated, but
it 13 certainly true that more than half it
all cases of poor hearing were caused by
catarrh.
The catarrhal secretion In the nose and
throat finds its way into the eustachlan
tube and by clogging -It up very soon af-
fects the hearing and the hardening of tha
secretion makes the loss of hearing per-
manent, unless the catarrh which caused
the trouble Is cured.
Those who are hard of hearing may
think this a little far fetched, but any (ma
at all observant must have noticed how
a hard cold in th# head will affect tho
hearing and that catarrh If long neglected
will certainly Impair the sense of hearing
and ultimately cause deafness.
If the nose and throat are kept clear
and free from the unhealthy secretions
of catarrh, the hearing will at once rreaÂ»-
ly Improve and any one suffering from
deafness and catarrh can satisfy them-
selves on this point by using a 50-cent
box of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new-
catarrh cure, which In the past year has
won the approval of thousands of catarrh
sufferers, as well as physicians, because
it is in convenient form to use. contains
no cocaine or opiate and Is as safe and
plea'sant for children as for their elders.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is a wholesome
combination of Blood Root, Oualacol. En-
caluptol and similar antiseptics and they
cure catarrh and catarrhal deafness by
action upon the blood and mucous mem-
brane of the nose and throat.
As one physician aptly expresses It:
"You do not have to draw upon thf*
imagination to discover whether you ar<*
getting benefit from Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets: improvement and relief are ap-
parent from the first tablet taken."
All druggists sell and recommend them.
They cost but 50 cents for full sized pack-
age and any catarrh sufferer who has
wasted time and money on sprays, salves
and powders will appreciate to the full
the merit of Stuart's Catarrh Tablet3.

SCARCE AT SACRAMENTO

fornia Is reaching out for the
50,000 mark. The count, so far
as completed to date, gives
the Republican Electoral tick
et 130,332 and the Democratic 112.2S3, a plu^
rality of CS.OO for McKinley. The same
precincts in 1S56 gave McKinley 134,316 and
Bryan 12S.S04.

votes. If the average of Republican gains
is kept up they will swell the plurality
to a figure considerably In excess of 40.000.

fornia has returned a solid Republican
delegation to Congress. In the Second
District, the only one in which the con
test was close. Samuel D. Woods will
have 1500 plurality over J. D. Sproul.

PETTIGREW'S NEW SCHEME.

SIOUX FALLS, S. D., Nov. 7.â "I pre

on the protests of the outraged against

clared United States Senator R, F. Fet

his home, to which he withdrew last night
when the first considerable batch of tel
egrams . arrived from South Dakota.
"I saw how It was going and wen*,

committee we were defeated In South Da

which the Republican party represents.
"Yes, of course. I. will be In the new
party. What It will be called Is of little
moment. It may be 'Social Labor* or It
may be the new Democracy. It will be
made up of persons discontented with the
elements in politics, as a protest against
the* existing condition and tho present
tendency of things. The movement will
grow rapidly and I believe will defeat the
Republican party In 1S04. The Mane

from further duty in Chinatown yester
day, after a service of three months and

HANNA IN CHEEKFUI. MOOIX
CLEVELAND. Nov. 7.â Senator Hanna
did not reach his office until after noon
to-day, having remained up until a very
late hour last night hearing the election
returns. Mr. Hanna found a perfect de
luge of congratulatory telegrams piled on
his desk. As the Senator glanced through
the messages he said:
"It Is a veritable Republican landslide.
It is even better than we expected, espe
cially In Indiana and Nebraska. The gen
eral result Is Indeed most gratifying."
Senator Hanna talked with State Chair
man Dick at Columbia by lone-dlstanca
telephone. General Dick eaid McKlnley'a
plurality In Ohio would not be less than
60.000, and that it might reach 80,000.
Mr. Hanna said that he preferred not
to give out a general statement cm . tha
result until he had thoroughly canvassed
the returns. He added that he would
probably have something to say later In
the day.
To-morrow night Mr. Hanna will leave
here for New York, where he will wind up
the affairs of tho national Republican
headquarters In that city.

KING ALEXANDRIA
NOW SEEKS A DIVORCE
GERMANY IS
WELL SATISFIED
Result of American Election
Well Received In
the Empire.
BERLIN, Nov. 7.â German Government
circles are all delighted at President Mc-
Kinley's re-election. The United States
Ejnbarsy to-day received a number of
expressions of that. kind.
Generally 3peaking, the German public
is taking much greater Interest In the
American election than heretofore. Ev
erybody is discussing the results. Dr. von
Holleben, the German Embassador to the
United States, who is now In this city,
said: "We all rejoice over it."
Barth. the Frelslnnige leader, said: "I
regard Mr McKinley's election, all things
considered, as the best result, although
I cannot indorse his imperialistic tenden
cies, yet I regard his election as more
conducive to the interests of general civ
ilization, when compared with the result!
which Mr. Bryan's election would have
brought. For the economic interests of
both the United States and Germany the
present result is also more satisfactory.
The Tageblatt says: "The Germans
greet Mr. McKinley's election above all
as a victory for sound currency over rev
olutionary money experiments which
would have been calculated to most se
verely shake the basis of the entire
world's commerce. Anyhow, Germany's
policy is to nurse close and loyal rela
tions with the head of a country which la
connected with us by so many economic
and national ties as 1b the United States.
"For that reason, too, the Emperor has
repeatedly made approaches to President
McKinley and the latter has, especially
recently, responded cordially. There is ln
ro part of the world serious differences
between th6 United States and Grmany.
In China both powers have marched on the
same lines after McKinley's first feeling
of distrust regarding Germany's alleged
territorial schemes subsided. We hope
that during his forthcoming administra
tion all political questions will be solved
between the two countries In the same
spirit of fairness and mutual confidence.
Above all. we hope that the question of a
commercial treaty will be solved."
The Vossische Zeitung says:
"Germany can only rejoice at the furth
er strengthening and solidification of the
economic conditions In the United States.
No State can escape the inconvenience of
having competitors in the world's market.
That must be reckoned with, and we must
put forth all our strength in peaceful
competition. But not only for North
American Industrial interests' Is Mr. Mc-
Kinley's re-election of great Importance,
but also for the entire commerce of the
world which is vitally interested ln a se
cure gold currency ln-the United States.
For these and a number of other reasons
the result of the election may be consid
ered the smaller one of two evils."
The Post says: "The result is greeted
with tatlBfaction and sympathy in Ger
many, for the re-elected President has
won the confidence of our Government
and our diplomacy during his term by his
constant efforts to maintain good rela
tions'- between Germany and the United
State*. In the midst of popular passion
the President preserved a cool head and
turned aside rude hands which tried to
force him â¢ Into an anti-German policy.
Mr. McKinley's victory means a continu
ance of the present pleasant relations be
tween Germany and the United States,
and we hope that the tariff negotiations
between them will also have at least as
good a mutual result." â¢ Â¦â¢ Â¦
SHANGHAI, Nov. 7.â It is reported that
the Empress Dowager, alarmed at the
news that the allies intended to Invade the
province of Honan. has ordered the south
ern armies to march promptly to guard
the passes on the frontiers.
WASHINGTON. Nov.* 7.â Minister Wu
called at the State Department to-day
and talked with Secretary Hay for half
an hour about the proceedings of the for
eign Ministers at Peking. The depart
ment takes the ground that while the
Ministers themselves are trying to get to
pettier on common ground to present a
General Richardson burned two villages,
the places where Messrs. Robinson and
Norman, the missionaries, were murered,
end demanded that tho city of Yang
ching should pay 40,000 taels as compensa
tion to the families of the victims. The
payment was guaranteed.
Three other villages were burned near
Sang Far.g. November 4.
A British column under General Rich
ardson left Paotlng October 2S. marching
In the direction of Peking. At Tungming
the troops tried three chiefs of Boxer
bands which destroyed a chapel and killed
native Christians. The British shot the
chiefs.
TAKL*. Nov. 7.â On October 30 General
Richardson met 500 imperial troops com
manded by General Fan. Both sides aJ
vancrd for a parley, but owing to an un
fortunate misunderstanding an Indian
trumpeter phot and killed General Fan.
The trumpeter was arrested and the Inci
dent was explained to the Chinese, the
two forces then proceeding by different
routes.
"The Novoe Vremya. ' Fays the St. Pe
tersburg correspondent of the Daily Ex
press, wiring bf-fore the re-election of Mc-
Kir.ley was known at the Russian capital,
"announces with official sanction that an
tjr.fierstatidirig has been reached between

"The other day I received a telegram
from Cheng, Governor of Shensi. inform

I wired to you. I have now received an
other telegTam from Governor Cheng,
stating that he has not yet received con

not reliable. I have, however, learned
that Yu Hslen has left Shansl and that
the Governor of Shansi, Hsl Liang, is

the honorable Secretary of State."
This subject promises to lead to ener
getic remonstrances from the Chinese
Government. Minister Wu handed to Sec
retary Hay the following cablegram,
dated November 6, 1900, from Viceroy
Chang Chin Tung, received by Minister
Wu on the morning of November 7:
Minister Wu was concerned at the sit
uation at Paoting-Fu. where the Germans
seem to have condemned to death certain
high Chinese functionaries.

make public any little dissensions or dif
ferences. So all* that can be gathere '
officially is that fair progress is being
made.

returns received up to midnight. There
remain five constituencies to be heard
from.
To-day's elections were ln 208 out of
the 213 constituencies of the Dominion,

elections at later dates. This, of course,
makes it entirely possible that when the
elections are completed and when the la
ter returns are in the apparent majority
may be reduced somewhat.

LEAVENWORTH, Kan., Nov. 7.â The
body of Pearl Forbes, aged 20 years,
was found ln a ravine near her home ln
this city this mornlngr. Marks on her
throat Indicated she had been murdered
by strangulation. The surroundings gave
evidence of a terrible struggle.
Miss Forbes, who was of a good fam
ily, had visited her married sister, a short
distance from the Forbes residence, yes
terday afternoon, starting for her home
at 6 o'clock In the evening. As far as
can be learned, that was the last ever
seen of her alive. There Is no clew to tht
murderer.
Feeling over the affair la intense and a
lynching would doubtless result if the
murderer were captured soon.

Among nine Democrats Senator Rawlina
of I'tah is the only one who is likely to
be succeeded by a Republican. The Re
publicans have more than equal chancrs
of winning the seats now held by Senators
Harris (Pop.) of Kansas. Kyle (Ind.) of
South Dakota and Turner iKusionist) of
Washington. Senator Wellington of Mary
land, who was elected as a Republican,
hut who has turned Democrat, will prob
ably be succeeded by a Democrat.
It Is practically certain that for at least
the tlrst half of the administration fol
lowing McKinley's second term the Re
publicans will have a good working ma
jority in the Senate.
The Republican Senators whose terms
expire March 3, 1901, come from Rhodi;
Island. California, Indiana. Michigan,
Wyoming, Minnesota, New York. Wash
ington, Maine. Ohio. Connecticut. NÂ»jw
Jersey. Massachusetts. Maryland. North
Dakota. Vermont. Wisconsin. West Vlr-Â«
ginia, Pennsvlvania. Delaware and Utah,
if the latter two elect Republicans to till
existing vacancies. In the House tne ma
jority over all is likely to be at leabt
forty-eight. North Carolina sends two
Republican? and there are many gains in
other districts now represented by Dem
ocrats. Secretary Kerr of the Democratic
Congressional Committee places the Re
publican representation at 191 and Demo
cratic at 166. ''
Appended are the members of the next
House as made up from the latest re
turns:
Alabamaâ George W. Taylor. V>. ; A. A. Wiley.
D.; Henry D. Clayton. D. : Sidney J. RÂ° wl<? . J>- â¢
C W Thompson, D. ; John II. Banknead. D. .
Of the Republicans whose terms will
expire on that date are Senators Allison
of Iowa, Mulllnger of New Hampshire,
Hansbrough of North Dakota. Penrose of
Pennsylvania. Perkins of California, Platt
of Connecticut. Ross of Vermont, Simon
of Oregon and Spooner of Wisconsin, who
are practically sure of being succeeded by
Republicans. There is very little doubt
that Senators Fairbanks of Indiana, For
aker of Ohio. Mason of Illinois and Platt
of New York will also be succeeded by
Republicans. Senators Deboe of Ken
tucky and Pritchard of North Carollnu
are practically sure to be succeeded by
Democrats.
The Republican majority over all oppo
sition in the next Senate will be not less
than fourteen, and if the Republicans
have carried all the new State Legisla
tures to which they now make claim it
may be as high as twenty.
The terms of thirty Senators will expire
March 3, 1901. Of. these sixteen are Re
publicans, nine Democrats, two are Pop
ulists and one is independent, one fusion
lst and one silver Republican.
Returns from several of the close States
are still indecisive, and ln some instances
the official count may have to be awaited
to determine whether the Republicans or
the opposition will control the Legisla
tures which will elect United States Sena
tors.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8.âInforma
tion received up to 3 o'clock
this morning Indicates In
creased majorities for the Re
publicans In both houses of
Congress. There is no uncertainty re
garding the continued Republican com
plexion of the Senate. In Montana the
fusion forces are. credited with a victory
which will return William A. Clark and
one other Democrat., To offset this â¢ are
the Republican success ln Delaware, Illi
nois, Kansas. New Jersey, South Dakota.
West Virginia, Wyoming and other
States. Nothing short of a veritable Dem
ocratic landslide can deprive the Repub
licans of the control of the Senate before
March 3, 1905, jmd unless there Is an al
most unprecedented political upheaval be
fore that date they are assured to con
trol for at least two years longer.
There Is No Uncertainty Concerning the Continued Repub
- lican Complexion of the National Legislature.
INCREASED MAJORITIES IN
BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS

"Lectures on Chronic Catarrh" is a complete
treatise on catarrhal diseases. It treats of every
phase and variety of summer catarrh, winter catarrh,
and the catarrhal affections peculiar to women.
This book contains ninety 'five pages, is instructively
illustrated, and will be found very useful in the fam-
ily. Sent free to any address by The Peruna MedU
cine Co., Columbus, Ohio.
Pe-ru-na is the medicine to do it. There are no
substitutes. Pe-ru-na is the only systemic catarrh remedy
yet advised.
There are hundreds of people dosing themselves for
this, that and the other, whose sole trouble is a catarrhal
condition of one or more organs of their body. If these
people will take Pe-ru-na it will make them well. It
will keep the grip away, it will prevent colds, and all of
the so-called winter diseases, which merely mean that
the mucous membrane of the entire body needs toning up
and cleaning.
PE-RU=NA-
the well-known catarrh cure.
Catarrh is a systemic disease. Contrary to general
opinion, it does not confine itself to the head and throat.
It attacks the stomach, the liver, the bowels, the lungs,
â any organ of the body. - The only way to cure it is
to cleanse the whole system by a thorough use of
If you are allowing catarrh to eat its way through
your body, you are like the man in the boat â drifting
upon a long river which ends with destruction.

A CHANCE TO SMILE
CHICAGO INTER OCEANâ London's
welcome to the returning- volunteers
from South Africa was at oneÂ© magnifi
cent and dlsrraceful. It showed the
average Englishman at his worst and at
his best. As a demonstration it was a
manifestation of English Intolerance, in
tensity of purpose, nationalism and loy
alty. It was a turbulent rejoicing over
a victory that England ought to b?
ashamed to celebrate. It was a wild orgy
over the destruction of two republics m
Africa. It was a shout of defiance to the
civilized world that sympathized with
the vanquished freemen.

The brutal special policeman who nearly beat an

to be a man who was once on the regular police

It is to-be hoped that the national nightmare . of
Eryanism is now over for all time. Even those Demo
crats who have a thought of their party's honor can
share this wish.
The city authorities are now concerning them
selves over the proper treatment of sick animals.
Municipal provision for ill citizens remains, however,
no better than a barn misnamed a City and County,
Hospital.
The critical day. of the political campaign having
passed, the national mind can now turn its attention
to football. The first item of interest has been fur
nished by a New York player who had his neck
broken on the gridiron.
That constitutes an extensive programme of do
mestic politics. If is to be noted, however, that noth

try to bring forward the general amnesty bill which
was passed by the Senate at the last session and was
designed to wipe out all the suits that remain from
the Dreyfus affair. In a recent speech' at Toulouse,
which was much commented on at the time, the
Premier expressly declared an intention to urge the
pessage of that bill, r.nd consequently the neglect to
The opening of the Senate was decorously dull.
In the Deputies there was something of interest.
The Premier annonuced that the Ministry would
give consideration to all interpellations, but reminded
the Deputies that if these were not confined to im
portant questions the whole session would be taken
upwith discussions of various issues of little moment
and the business of the country would suffer. The
first interpellation was a request for information con
cerning the general policy of the Ministry. To that
the Premier replied that the Government desires the
discussion of a few reform measures of immediate in
terest, simultaneously with the budget discussion.
These reforms, he explained, were a law to reduce
the tax on alcohol, old age pensions, official arbi
trators for labor disputes and the reform of courts
martial, and the law of associations, which, he 6aid,
ought to be one of the first acts of the Republican
party, to avert the peril which menaced the public
fortune and moral unity of the country.
WHEN the Nationalists at the last elections
swept Paris and elected a majority of the
Municipal Council it was announced that as
soon as the exposition was over there would be an
attack upon the Waldeck- Rousseau Ministry that
would drive it from power/ The close "of the expo
sition is at hand, and on Tuesday the Senate and the
Chamber of Deputies reassembled for the fall ses

times were disappointed. The proceedings in both
houses were comparatively tame, and no evidence
was shown of any intention to make a serious effort
to overthrow the Ministry at this time.

How he will go about his reform remains to be
seen, but if he wishes advice on the subject Ameri
cans can give him a good deal, and every bit of it will
be sound horse sense. Uncle Sam would advise him
to treat Russian nobility as Russian serfdom was
treated. An emancipation proclamation should be is
sued relieving every man from the burden of false pre
tenses and onerous titles. The best way to reform any
nobility is to abolish it.
By reason of the number and the poverty of the
order Russian nobility is said to be anything but
aristocratic. A good many Princes sell herrings for a
living and about as many Princesses. take in washing.
By reason of that fact, which the Czar regards as a sad
one, the Russian nobility is said to be scorned by the
wealthier nobility of Western Europe, and the Czar
feels that his country is discredited.
It must not be supposed his reform is anything of
a moral project. He is not disturbed by the drinking,
the gambling and cigarette smoking of his nobles.
The only thing that makes him tired is that there are
too many of them and they are not aristocratic. In
Russia every child of a noble is also a noble, and,
furthermore, every, one who attains to a certain rank
in the service of the empire becomes a member of the
nobility by virtue of his office, and then all his
descendants are nobles. The Tesult is a rapid increase
of nobles, some of whom may be rich, but most of
whom are not. Thus it happens there are now in
the empire over 600,000 nobles by inheritance and
250,000 nobles by virtue of the office they hold.' That,
as the Cxar rightly thinks, is altogether too many, and
he. meditates an extensive cleaning. out of the whola
gang.
OUR great and good friend the Czar of Russia
is reported to be lying awake at night think
ing how he can best reform the Russian no
bility and make it .something the nation can be justly
proud of. He leaves to his diplomats and his generals
the settlement of the Chinese question, and his famous
propaganda for universal peace has seemingly been
laid aside altogether, so that he has now full leisure
after the court functions for the day are over to spend
his evenings playing with his babies and meditating
how to elevate the nobility.

NEW* YORK, Nov. 7.â The following
CAI/IFORNIANS IN NEW YOBK,
The interest of the United States in "the struggle
for the trident" is not so vital as that of Great Brit
ain. Our national salvation and prestige do not de
pend upon the control of the sea, but our commer
cial interests demand that we act as energetically as
cither Germany or Britain in the contest. We now
pay an enormous tribute to those two powers, and
with the expansion of our foreign trade the tribute
will increase unless we build up a merchant marine
of our own. Hardly ?>ny issue now before the coun
try is more important than this, and from all parts
r>f the country there should bÂ« sent petitions urging
Congress to take action upon it this winter.
At the present time the competitor whom the Brit
ish fear most is Germany. We have waited so long a
time in devising legislation for the upbuilding of our
rrerehant marine that even that heavily burdened and
comparativelj' poor and landlocked empire has sur
passed us on the sea, despite the fact that our sea
board commands thousands of miles of frontage on
the tiro greatest of oceans. Referring to what has
been accomplished there by wise statesmanship, the
Chronicle says: "A new and resolute claimant for
sea power has risen. Germany has doubled and
trebled her navy- Already she holds the Atlantic
record. Her system of mail subsidies has secured
not merely a foothold in Asia and Australia, where
formerly Britain was supreme, but is on the eve of
driving another fleet of British steamships from the
i,ea. Germany has stretched out her hands .for the
trident. * * * Within a few months the Reich
stag will again be asked to increase the German fleet
by 50 per cent." â¢. , >â¢'.
The main object of Mr. Bullen's book is to bring
about an improvement in the personnel of the British
mercantile service, .ind to confincÂ«that service very
largely to British seamen. He says: "I feel sure we
are heaping up for ourselves a most awful mountain
of disaster in the way in which we are allowing it to
become a foreign service.. One thing we could do and
tijiould do at once â apply the same rule to the mer
chant service that is in force in the royal navy. There
no alien, unless he has become naturalized, can hold
any post whatever. It sound's like a small reform,
tmt it would have, I am sure, the most far-reaching
effects." : ;, ; :;
Germany has already become a formidable com
petitor against the British in the ocean carrying trade,
and the Chronicle adds: "The United States, busy in
building up their navy, are not likely to remain con
tent until they have recovered their splendid mercan
tile marine. Nearly the whole of their immense
carrying trade over sea is practically in the hands
of the British. When the change comes the British
carrying trade, like British agriculture, will shrink
to a shadow of its former self."
T â ; T. BULLEX, a member of the Royal Geo
! graphical Society, has just had published in
* â¢ London a book bearing the title, "The Men
of the Merchant Service,"' which has given rise to a
good deal of discussion. The London Chronicle in
commenting upon it speaks of it as "drawing the pic
ture of England's decadent merchant navy in a way
to make statesmen think," and goes on to say: "It
will be no fault of Mr. Bullen's if the supremacy of the
carrying tfade, which we still possess on conditions
that cannot be maintained, is not continued 'on
sounder and healthier lines."
The sum 'and substance oi the work is that the sail
ing vessel is fast disappearing from the ocean, and
that along with it the old-fashioned British sailor is
passing away. The future of sea traffic is with steam
Â¦vessels, and the prediction is made that the end of
the sailing ship for large commercial uses will come
when the Panama or Nicaragua canal is open for in
teroceanic traffic. Then the trade of all the Pacific
coast of both North and South America â the grain
of California and the nitrates of the countries to the
south of us â will pass through the canal in steam
ships, and big sailing vessels will vanish from the
gteat oceans.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The growth of population and the increase of
wealth have not been equally distributed through the
Union, but there is not enough difference to give
rise to any feeling of sectional envy or discontent.
The sections where the progress has been less than
the hopes of the 'sanguine expected are the Pacific
Coast and the South, but each of those sections has
a promise of a brilliant advance during the decade
that now opens. The development of manufactures in
the South will surely bring about a great improve
ment in those States, and the expansion of oriental
commerce will give this coast an impetus that will
rapidly promote all her enterprises. As yet neither
California nor Texas take rank among the "empire
States" of the Union, but it will not be long before
they do so. The time when they will be rivals to
Illinois and Ohio, if not to New York and Pennsyl
vania, is coming fast.
Along with that increase of population there has
come a most gratifying increase of wealth. The offi
cial figures on that point have not yet been fully given
out, but in a recent address delivered at Washington
Dr. L. G. Powers, chief statistician of the Census
Bureau, stated that the census will show that within
the last ten years our people have saved the enor
mous sum of $25,000,000,000, and that the whole vis
ible wealth of the country now approximates $90,000,
000,000. Ninety billions of dollars is an enormous
sum of money. It can be expressed in figures, but it
cannot be realized by the understanding or conceived
by the imagination. Dr. Powers is quoted as saying
that the savings of the last ten years in this country
"represent more houses and buildings, more good
clothes, good books and all sorts of necessities and
luxuries than the entire^human race had saved from
the time of Adam to our Declaration of Indepen
dence."
The statement given out by the Census Bureau and
published a few days ago, shows that the total popu
lation of the country -last summer was 76,295,220, of
which 74,627,907 persons are contained in the forty
five States. The statement also shows a total of 134,
158 Indians not taxed. The total population in 1890,
with which the aggregate population at the present
census should be compared, was 63,069,756, compris
ing 62,622,250 persons enumerated in the States and
organized Territories at that census, 32,052 persons in
Alaska, i8o,i82 x Indians and other, persons in the In
dian Territory, 145,282 Indians and other persons on
Indian reservations, etc., and 89,990 persons in
Hawaii, this last named figure being derived from the
census of the Hawaiian Islands taken as of December
28, 1890. Taking this population as given above for
1890 as a basis, there has been a gain in population
of 13,225,464 during the ten years from 1890 to 1900,
representing an increase of very nearly 21 per cent.
OUR WEALTH, AND POPULATION.
SINCE the elections are over and there is no
longer anything to be gained by disputing the
prosperity of the country, even the Bryanites
may be pleased with the record shown by trie returns
of the recent census. The figures are of a nature to
brighten expectations of the coming Thanksgiving
and to put every / gooi citizen in a humor to celebrate
with a glad heart all the functions and customs of thai
annual holiday.

say anything about it in the. Chamber of Deputies is
the more surprising. > . ' {
Whether the opponents of the Ministry have any
plan by which they can combine all parties in antago
nism to the Ministry remains to be seen. If such a
combination be possibW it will not be long before
it is set to work. In the . meantime M. Waldeck-
Rousseau appears sanguine of holding his position.
He has been quoted *s saying recently that the great
banquet at Paris, in which the Mayors of almost all
the communes .of France took part, was virtually a â¢
manifestation that the country is with him, and to
have spoken of it as "the, most striking consecration
any regime ever had." The enthusiasms of banquets,
however, do not last very long, and before Christmas
there may be stormy times for the Government which
is now so sanguine of a long hold on office.
California lifts up her head in salute to the Union
and the constitution, and admonishes her citizens who
went astray that they have no hope for a future that
is based upon the expectation that she is kind to
schemes of revolution urged by methods abhorrent to
American patriotism.
In the great procession of States she hails President
McKinley as the chief of the republic ar^d the custo
dian of its highest purposes.
The desperate men who have ruined one of the
great parties in a vain revolution may now go into
retirement discredited. In the politics of the future
the people will divide, but one side will not be a mob,
with all the disorderly and destructive purposes by
which mobs are moved.
The republic is to-day stronger than ever before.
The insidious enemy of popular institutions is dema
gogy, more to be feared than the world in arms. Twice
the demagogy bi Bryanism has fiercely assaulted the
foundations of our Government, and twice it has been
repulsed by the most significant rebuke ever adminis
tered by a free people. This has not meant that there
is to be but one party here. Free institutions cannot
exist under that condition. But it means that par
ties must be loyal to the constitution, must seek by
different means the same end, and that the glory of
the country and the prosperity of its people.
Our external policy will get a sane adjustment.
The American people will do equity to everybody.
The inevitable miseries that mix with the blessings
of the Spanish war will be soothed at any cost by the
American people, even at the cost of amending their
constitution if that shall prove necessary.
No man pretends that all this future development
may be had without occasional pauses, when it will
rest a bit to get breath for the exertion to come.
But. in such pause, it will hold what it has taken and
go backward not an inch.
The country has risen and shaken the whole com
bination off, and every good heart brightens and beats
stronger for the effort. The work begun in the result
of 1S96 will go on unchecked. Our monetary stan
dard is forever secure. A superstructure of enlight
ened financial legislation will be built upon that sound
foundation. Our banking system will be improved
laid broadened with no dilution of its safety. Our
great trade will hold its ground and enlarge it. Its de
mands upon our industry will increase and American
labor will be called to more constant employment.
Our enterprise and capital will penetrate, distant fields
and American money will build railroads on alien
soil, and American workmen will equip them. We
will proceed to reconquest the carrying trade of the
world by controlling our own. Our vast deep water
trade will be carried in American ships, built in
American shipyards by American workmen. The
triumphs of our navy will be equaled by those of our
merchant marine, an-1 our flag will flutter over the
ocean commerce of the world. That new avenue will
be opened as a career to our captains and crews. Tens
of thousands of Americans will find therein congenial
and profitable employment. We have the greatest land
transportation on the planet, the best and the cheap
est. We will have soon the greatest, best and cheap
est transportation system on the waters.
I T is significant that fewer mourners go about the
i I streets than are usually seen after a Presidential
j election. In their hearts hundreds of thousands
of Bryan's supporters are glad that he is beaten. They
felt a common stake in the welfare of the country and
dreaded the effect of his election. While they pre
tended to hope for his election as a prize in the lottery
of politics, they rejoice that they drew a blank in his
| defeat. His methods were counted as extraordinary,
| but their lack of dignity was equally apparent. His
j ubiquitous presence en the stump weakened him
j daily. His expert dodging of test questions fixed
I him in the public mind as a sort of "smart Aleck" in
politics and made the lack of his qualifications for the
Presidency more painfulb' apparent. But that very lack
drew to him an element that was trained in disrespect
for the decencies of politics, and is moved by a purely
revolutionary view ol public affairs. This is the
merely destructive clement in the United States. The
few men of sound intentions who supported him had
finally thrust upon them the appalling conviction that,
if elected, they would have no voice nor influence in
his administration, which would be controlled by the
destructives and bent to their purposes. Of the de
stroying element Hearst and his three papers were
the leaders. They furnished the country with an ex
hibition of inconsistency and foul and impudent lying
that has never been equaled in American politics.
The personal effrontery of Hearst, his flamboyant
proclamations, his pandering to everything bad, his
persistent personal abuse of the President, his prac
tice of everything vicious and low and capable of de
grading public life to the mud of the gutter in which
he chooses to flounder, made a handicap to Bryan sec
ond only to his own indiscretions of speech and shal
lowncss of statement.

When one has, some. Idea of the good
things that Shakespeare got from his
sources it will Be interesting to see the
bad things he got. He did not always
winnow the wheat from the chaff, and the
result was that he retained many of the
crudities of the raw material. For in
stance, many of the conceits and quibbles
In "As You Like It" are in Lodge's "Rosa
lynde." and some of the things in the old
play of "Hamlet" remain to mar the
beauty of the play as we. have It now.
One of. the most interesting of tha recent
Three good plays In which to study his
Indebtedness to his source are "Antony
and Cleopatra," "Romeo and Juliet" and
"As You Like It"; for the first reading
Plutarch s "Life of Mark Antony." for the
second Brooke's "Romeus and Juliet." and
for the third Ledge's "Rosalynde." I have
seen more than one student with much of
his hero worship gone after making the
study of these three plays and their
sources. The ract is that a poor reader
of "Antony and Cleopatra" would get
about as mucn out of Plutarch as he
would from the play.
Indeed, the first Impression of one who
makes the study we are suggesting Is the
striking similarity between the play and
its source. One explanation of such simi
larity is that the dramatist of that day
considered that his work was one of
translation merely. Whatever he found
adapted to the stage he used, very much
as a modern playwright would dramatize
â¢The Scarlet Letter." Shakespeare seems
utterly indifferent as to any charges of
plagiarism that might be brought: hÂ« took
what other men had done and used It for
his own purposes.
And yet I hasten to say that he was In
a sense very dependent on his books.
There- is scarcely an original plot in hl3
plays, only two or three in which he Is
not indebted to some one of the sources
I have already mentioned. He was one
of the greatest borrowersâ plagiarists. If
you please. What Lowell said of Chaucer
applies with even greater force to Shakes
peare: whenever he saw anything directed
to him he took it and never used quota
tion marks. Though he read but Httle, he
was master of what hs did read, a crea
tive reader, to use an expression of Emer
son's. There are scenes in his Roman
plays, for instance, that are almost para
phrases of Plutarch. Many of the inci
dents that readers of his plays have raved
over may bÂ« found in the sources that he
used.
novels, old plays, old ballads and songs.
and. for single plays such things as
Lodge's "Rosalynde," Brooke's "Romeus
and Juliet," etc. He may have read
'â¢Chapman"s Homer" In writing "Troilus
and Cressidi," and he was doubtles?
familiar with Chaucer's "Troilus and Crl
seyde" and the "Knight's Tale." â¢
One Is struck with the small number of
books that Shakespeare read. We wonder
how such a man as he was. living in the
time of the renaissance, could have read
so little classic literature, so little French
and Italian literature. The greatest of
poets did not know Homer or Virgil or
Dante! Such limited reading has caused
the absurd theory to be advanced that
such an ignorant man could not have
written the plays we have from his pen.
Such a theory" need 1 detain us no longer
than to say that learning did not pro
duce /Shakespeare's plays, nor literary
culture. He was of all men the least
bookish. He had the genius to get hold
of Just what he needed In the way of
books, and to learn that with the rapidity
of hU marvelous genius. But his great
est teacher was the life of his day. Some
one asked 'Wordsworth's servant one day
where the master's study was. The re
ply was that his books were in the house,
but his study was out of doors. And so
Shakespeare's study was In the theater
and the tavern and on the street. He
picked up more from conversation and ob
servation than most men do from the
reading of a lifetime. It Is easy to see
what was not In his library, for he was
as far removed as possible from the
scholarly Milton or the bookish Southey.
peare" and the more recent study of
Shakespeare by Georar Branded, we may
realize how Shakespeare developed In all
things that make one of the greatest of
men and the greatest of dramatists. An
other triumph of modern scholarship was
the finding of Shakespeare's sources and
by comparing- them with the plays to seÂ«
â¢how the dramatist workedâ what he re
jected and what he accepted, what he al
tered and what he added. In some such
way we may learn some of the secrets of
his art and of his mind. 1

OF all thÂ« British ships In port
the Speke has received the
quickest dispatch. Over 4500
tons of grain were put aboard
her in five days and the steve
dores consequently jubttant.
The Speke Is the largest "ship" afloat.
She Is three-masted and square-rigged on
the mlzzen, so In every sense she is "a
6hlp." The Ditton that was here last year
was 'classed as the largest ship afloat, but
she is just twelve tons less burden than
the Speke. Both vessels, belong to the
same firm. The Speke will take away
from here 4557 tons of wheat, one of the
largest wheat cargoes ever carried In a
single bottom.
Captain Stott Is well known In San
Francisco. He has been coming here for
years, and his brother Is the well-known
Jeweler. When last in England he became
a benedict and his son and heir was born
on Admission day, when the Speke was
within Pight of the Golden Gate. The lad
has been named John Alfred Speke Stott,
and while his mother asserts he Is a na
tive son, the father claims him for an
Knglishman. Anyhow he Is a bouncing
boy and a credit to the ship Speke. .
The Speke had a terrible time on her
Manauense in Trouble.
The steamer Manauense, which arrived
from Oyster Harbor yesterday morning,
was in trouble. She tied up at Folsom
street wharf, but the ebb tide and strong
wind carried her away. She drifted stern
on, against the bunkers and damaged
her starboard quarter, carrying away the
rail. A tug had to be called in order to
get the steamer back to her berth. The
Manauense will sail for Mexican ports on
the 1st prox.

.YIIL
In-th" British Museum there is a copy
of Florio's translation of Montaigne, with
Shakespeare's autograph In It. If this
autograph Is genuine, and there Is some
reason to think that It Is, It Is the only
book that we may definitely associate
with his library- It is certain from Gon
zalo's description of an Ideal common
wealth In "The Tempest" that Shake
speare was acquainted with Montaigne, I
and it is probable that he saw Florio's
translation of the essays before It was
published. Brandos finds many passages
In the other plays that suggest Mon
taigne. There must have been something
in the brilliant Frenchman to attract one
who was, like himself, a profoundly hu
man soulâ "a human being, natural,
many sided, full of ability, rich in contra
dictions."
This Is evidently one book that Shake
speare read; were there others? And how
many more? In 1743 J. Payne Collier pub
lished what he called "Shakespeare's Li
brary"âa collection of the romances and
novels, etc., that the dramatist used In
writing his plays. This list was found
Incomplete by later scholars, and so W.
C. Hazlltt brought out a new edition of
Collier's work in six. volumes, containing
all the sources of the plays. It would be
well for every student to have access to
this very important work, so that he may
make at lea$t one or two studies com
paring the respective plays and their
sources. This is the material, with which
we may work out the way in which
Shakespeare used the raw material and
evolved his plays. Through these sources
we get an idea of his way of working.
By far the most useful books were
"Hollnshed's Chronicles" and "North's
Translations of Plutarch's Lives," the
former published In 1577 and the latter In
1587. Both of them were interesting be
cause they supplied him with studies of
the most interesting men the world had
known, and also with incidents that
might be worked Into plots. From Holln
shed he got the material for about ten
plays, and from North all of his Roman
plays and "Tlmon of Athens." Next to
these books he relied mostly on "Gesta
Romanorum," collections of Italian

SHAKESPEARE'S USE OF BOOKS.
THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
From such a study will come a more In
telligent appreciation , of Shakespeare's
plays. One triumph of modern scholar
ship was the working out of a reasonably
sure chronology of the plays, so that by
the aid of Dowden'a "Shakespeare: Hia
Mind and Art" and Wendell's "Shakes-
Such study Is what one might call dra
matic education, for instance the tracinj
of "Macbeth" fr^m Hollnshed to an in
ferior dramatist ar:<l then to Shakespeare.
To be more specific, let him see that while
In the main he ha^ reproduced the story
of "RoÂ»alynde" he has added the immor
tal characters Jaques and Touchstone an<S
added to tne whole a Ifghtsomeness tha<
Lodge never dreamed of; let him seÂ« <-hÂ«r
marvelous effect produced in "King Lea?"'
by the fool; let him see the difference be
tween the language of HolinÂ«Â«hed and the
speeches of Lady Macbeth and her hus
band. In the play of "Coriolanus" we have
no longer the feud between patrician and
plebeian emphasized, but the heroic and
tragic figure of Marcius: while the drama
tist has changed the "Troublesome Ralgn*
of Kliig John"" from an onslaught on the
Catholics into a play in which living fig
ures move and the interest is one of lifÂ«
and not of sect. And. finally, not to sug
gest all the kinds of changes that one may
look for. let the student see how Shakes
peare has changed a blood and thunder
tragedy such as - "Ham!et" was Into what
many consider the greatest of dramas.
If one would get the full value of the
general truth that we have Just suggested
he must take some play or several and see
how the dramatist worked over the ma
terial. He will ttnd that It is one of th*
best ways by which he may grow in his
ability to interpret a drama as . it
should be.
studies of "Hamlet" is that by Mr. John
Corbin. developing the point I have just
suggested.
But after all has bÂ«?en sa!d at>cut
Shakespeare's indebtedness to ether men
it still remains that his playa are .his. "and
not another's. The changes h* made are
much more remarkable than the parallel
isms. The" shaping spirit of Imagination
took hoJd of what was crude ore and
made It into gold. He vitalized HoUnshed.
spiritualized Plutarch and "eternalized '
every story he made use of. He did for
them what Browning did for the book he
found on the bookstall in Florence one
dayâfused his live soul and that inert
stuff; the life in him abolished the death
of things. He- mingled gold with gnld"3
alloy and the result Is an "added art
istry."

Climate and Crop Report.
CHICAGO. Nov. 7.â Wheat started with the
boom on an advance of Id at Liverpool since
Monday and on the result of yesterday's bal
loting December opened %(ff%c higher at 74%
to 74V4. It took but a few moments for the
bubble of activity to burst. That there was
a very small chort interest became evident ear
ly, as opening buyers were few. Late in the
day there was some news bullish in character,
but It failed to check the decline materially.
Around 74c December steadied for awhile on
unfavorable Argentine advices, but Bradstreefs
Increase in the world's visible of 1,200.000 bush
els caused renewed weakness and December
under the liquidation and lack of support which
hao depressed the market all along, dropped to
73>i l 5734Â»c and closed %<jr-%c under Monday
at 73Â»ic.
Corn was quiet and comparatively steady.
December closed tt@V4c under Monday at 35%c
There was only a small professional business
In oats. December closed V*<8>V<c lower at 27 7 ,ic
Provisions opened higher on a lleht run of
hogs, higher prices at the yards and In sym
pathy with wheat. Tone, however, showed
no particular firmness and on liberal offerings
of lard and ribs the price yielded readily
January pork closed 5c under Monday lard
2'a<3Sc lower and ribs closed 6c down.

On tho Produce Exchange to-day the butter
confined to professional operators. The events
of the day In the New York market proved that
the great mass of outside speculation which
is attracted by a national political event wait
ed to place their orders in the New York mar
ket. The professional operators who have been
taking on stocks for several weeks past threw
over thflr holdings on an enormous scale to
take advantage of the outside demand. The
buying continued with such animation and
speculative sentiment became so buoyant that
buying for the long account was renewed on
a very large scale by both professional and
outside speculators. The sudden relapse In 1
thÂ« money market bad much to do with the re
newed outburst of speculation. As against the ;
25 per cent rate on Monday, the first loan to- I
day was made at 5 r*r cent, which was the |
highest of the day. In the late dealings the j
rate fell to 1 per cent. The extreme advance 1
in Northern Pacific was 3T*. A number of in- 1
dustrlals reacted between 1 and 2 points, but
in the railroads the last prices were only a
frartlon below the best and the market was In 1
progress of recovery and closed firm. :
The bond market was quite as active com
parntlvely as the stock market, and was also
very broad, although the mortgages with
speculative value were the most prominent.
Several of thoye rose from 1 to 1% per cent. To
tal pales, par value. $r>.2."i3,000.

CLOSING.
Americans dominated the market here to
day. They were first, the rest were nowhere.
The trlumrli of McKinley aroused the great
est enthusiasm. The market which opened at
9 o'clock was surprised by hea.vy realizing
eales from New York, but London easily ab
sorbed all these offerings although the public
was not prominent as purchasers. The pro
fessionals regarded the Republican majority in
the House of Representatives aa a powerful
factor and Investors are expected to come Into
thÂ» market for 'American bonds considering
how much they yield, while stocks are thought
to be relatively more active. The Continent
did little but the market finished buoyant and
active, although it is *ald that the business
done was much less than that transacted after
the election In 1SS6.

Truck He Won on Julius Kahn's Election.
ASHE'S SWEET POTATOES GO
TO EPICURES AND ORPHANS
gold that he stood to win.
Two hours after the bet was made Por
ter Ashe's friends were admitting that he
was defeated, and five hours after It was
made even Will Ashe was forced to admit
that he was a carload lot of sweet po
tatoes poorer. He promptly signed an
order on Porter Bros, for the delivery of
the potatoes on Williams' demand or
order.
Wllllamg was busy yesterday making
out a list of friends to whom heiwlll send
sacks of the choice article known In the
market' as "Merced sweet potatoes," for
these were raised on the Ashe family's
Maltese Villa ranch. Among the epicures
who will be so remembered are Major
McLaughlln, M. F. Tarpey, Julius Kahn.
whose gallant race won the potatoes; A.
B. Spreckels, S. M. Shorttidge. Harry
Veuve, J. Naglee Burke. Frederick Zeile.
D.-M. Burns. M. H. de Young and a host
of others. Six sacks will be unloaded into
the Pacific Union Club cellar. The re
mainder of the carload will be divided
among the orphan asylums, to help fill the
little dinner pails, as Sam Shortrldge
would put It. There will be many to re
joice with Tom Williams over the killing
he made in garden truck when Julius
Kahn won In a canter from Porter Ashe.
THE BIT OF PAPER BY WHICH POSSESSION WAS GIVEN OF THE CARLOAD OF SWEET POTATOES LOST
BY W. L. ASHE AND WON BY T. H. WILLIAMS JR. ON AN ELECTION BET.
TH. WILLIAMS JR. will be
come a dispenser of sweet
potatoes to-day. He has a
carload of the succulent tu
bers won so easily on an elec T
tlon bet that he thinks If he were to sell
them It would be a shame to take tho
money. While he has not handled a sack
in this campaign he now Intends to dis
tribute several with impartial liberality
to Democratic and Republican friends
alike. The larger part of the carload will
be divided among the orphan asylums of
San Francisco.
The tale of Williams* unique bet of dol
lars against garden truck is being ; told
and laughed over among clubmen and
politicians. Will L. Ashe was the other
bettorâ the man who lost the potatoeo.
His discomfiture was due to an overcon
ndence In the ability of his brother. R.
Porter Ashe. to defeat Julius Kahn in
the race for Congressman.
Ashe had not spoken to Williams since
1S93, when Porter Ashe and Williams had
trouble and litigation over the ownership
of the mare Geraldlne and other raco
horses purchased by Williams from Mike
Kelly, Ashe's trainer. To the great Bur.
prise of Williams Ashe approached him-
In the Palace Hotel bar Tuesday eveninff
and called him away from Major Frans
McLaughlln and Louis Ltssak, with whom
ho waB talking. The three thought for a
moment that trouble was brewing, but
Ashe said goodnaturedly:
"Tom, I'd like to make a little bet with
you on the election, Just for the sake of
old times."
"Well. I'm agreeable," replied William*,
"what will it be. Will?" ,
"I've bet all the ready cash I have."
Ashe said, "on my brother's election, but
I had a carload of sweet potatoes shipped
which arrived to-day, consigned to Porttx
Bros. Now. I'll bet those potatoes against
their market value In money that K. Por
ter Ashe will be elected Congressman."
'â¢I'll take it," said Williams "and If
you have any more garden truck bring it
along and I'll cover It with money."
. â¢ So the wager was made at even money,
prosperity prices for the potatoes. Odds
were at that time In the evening 3 to 1
against Porter Ashe. but when a man Is
betting potatoes that he raised himself
and betting them on his brother's election
to Congress he does not figure odds very
closely. Besides It was good McKinley

HAS A SOCIAL SESSION
IX>S ANGELES. Nov. 7.â The long ex
pected report of the committee of fifteen,
which has be*n engaged for some time in
fin Investigation of abuses In certain of
the departments of the city Rovemment,
has been given to the public. The com
mittee has been making a patient search
since Its organization, and has expended
much time and money In Its efforts to get
at the bottom of the wrongs alleged to
have been carried on and still existing.
Particular attention Is paid to the police
department, where Police Commissioner
Ling comes In for a scoring. The report
on the Police Commission, after certain
explanations by the committee of fifteen,
was adopted without dissent. The report
Fays in part:
"The general charges against the police
commission* current In the communitj .
among others, were: That Immunity to
carry on the various Chinese gambling
games, the opium dens and the lottery
houses, was purchased by the ChinamÂ«n
from either the police commission or some
of Its members, or from persons claiming
to have Influence with them: that the
matter of granting and transferring liquor
licenses In the city of Los Angeles ls be
ing controlled by the brewers, who own
a Targe number of saloons and who are
carrying on the saloon business on an ex
tensive scale; that great favoritism tx
if>ts In the granting of liquor licenses and
In permitting transfers thereof; that cor
rupt Influences were brought to bear to
prevent' the suspension or revocation of
licenses that ought to have been revoked
for gross violation of city ordinances ;
that In many Instances the license sus
pended or revoked was either renewe-1
or transferred to some nominee of the
former licensee and for ais benefit, oy
means of corrupt bargains or Influences;
that the city regulation of saloons wax
being constantly violated as to Sunday
and night closing.
"This committee thereupon secured the
service* of a local detective and later on
the services of two detectives from the
Pinkerton agency."
The ieport then cites In detail the evi
dence accumulated against Commissioner
Ling and others and shows conclusively
that the police department has long been
hand In glove with the Chinatown gam
bling ring, the saloon element and other
law-breaking elements. Former Police
Captain Roberts Ib particularly well
grilled, the report stating that his dis
missal ought to have taken place long
ago. Specific instances of bribery and col
lusion are cited against members of the
department, and In one Instance a witness
against Roberts was spirited away Just
before the captain was to be tried on a
serious charge.
Certain members of the City Council
known as the "High Five" are also
dressed up.

LIKENS COUNCIL
TO WEATHERVANE
Mayor Snow Descants Upon
the -Varied Moods of
City Fathers.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 7.
"If ever It should come to pass that
coats of arms should be adopted by civic
bodies I believe a. weathervane would be
appropriate for the present City Coun
cil." was Mayor Snow's caustic sentiment
expressed to-day nt a meeting of the
Board of Public Works during a discus
sion concerning the purchase of Fire De
partment house sites In the annexed ter
ritory.
For some reason not apparent on the
surface, a faction In the municipal legis
lature has been busily engaged In doub
ling back on the question of purchase of
lease of site for an engine-house. Half
a dozen resolutions have been transmitted
from the Council to the board, and there
have been so many changes of opinion
that his Honor has become exasperated,
particularly In view of the fact that the
board has long Flnce leased one site and
ls about ready to close the lease on an
other one.
The property selected Is a lot on Vernon
avenue, near Telegraph avenue. Alden
leased It from H. C. Babcock at $10 a
month, with option of purchase within
two years for $600. The second site ls at
Klinkner and San Pablo avenues, leased
for $12 a month from Charles A. Klinkner.
with option of purchase for $323.
' Plans for the engine-houses, which will
be temporary structures, will be ready
Monday.
The Board of Police Commissioners re
ceived a communication to-day from Mrs.
Lena Rice, who desires to retain her un
salaried position of City Prison matron,
although she has resigned as assistant
secretary of the Apsoclated Charities.
Mrs. D. C. Borland, who succeeded to the
assistant secretaryship, has been present
ed for the matron's place by the associa
tion. The Police Commissioners will not
directly intei fere, but a suggestion has
been made which will probably settle the
difficulty before the next meeting of the
board.
Chief Hodgklns reported that he had In
vestigated charges made against Police
man Sill by Edward Tharslng and did not
believe they eould be sustained.' The re
port was filed.

SUPERVISOR BOOTH WILL PAY.
Hust Roll Peanut Up Stairs With a
Toothpick.
Supervisor James P. Booth will pay an
election bet to-day. That ls, he will pay
it if the day is long: enough and If he pos
sesses the necessary skill to roll a pea
nut up the five flights of stairs of the
Press Club building with a toothpick.
Booth's bet was made with F. N. Moore,
another. member of the Press Club. Moore
haa luxuriant red whiskers and he agreed
to shave them oft and present them to
Booth on a platter If Bryan' should be
elected. Booth's end of the wager had to
be something different, for he has no
Â¦whiskers on his chin. The tooth
pick and peanut feat was agreed upon.
The worthy Supervisor will start early
and presumably will . still be at work
when twlllsht falls.

The fisrures of Alameda County are in
teresting. In but one precinct in the
county did Bryan get a vote of more than
two figures and that was In Frultvale
No. 3. a very large precinct, and there he
received 115 votes, but McKinley received
214. Exactly the same thing is to be said
of Freeman, the Democratic candidate for
Congress, and In this Fame precinct he
received 10S votes. The contest for the
banner Republican Assembly district in
the county lay between the Forty-sev
enth District, which comprises all of Ala-
So Alameda County gave the second
largest majority in the State and thÂ»
largest majority In proportion to the total
vote cast, for the McKinley vote was more
than two to one. This county has elected
a complete Republican legislative ticket,
a complete Republican Board of Super
visors and a complete Republican judi
ciary. Even San Francisco, with its big
majority of figures, cannot show a vote
of two to one for McKinley.
The Republican nominees for Superior
Judgesâ John Ellsworth of Alameda and
F. B. Ogden of Oaklandâ made most re
markable runs and their majorities will
be almost 10,000 each. They ran far ahead
of the national ticket, owing- to their per
sonal standing r.Â»id popularity and to the
feeling that It Is best to retain a good
iudiclary, which Alameda County is ac
nowledged to have.

The vote on Berkeley Justices of the
Peace was a? follows: Edgar. 1165; Lloyd
674; Lord, 330.
There was great rejoicing In Oakland to
day until the returns from San Francisco
came In. and then Oakland found that It
had lost the banner in a direction that It
did not expect.
â¢%â¢ ,
across the bay and is prepared to surren
der the banner.
But in giving up the banner to the big
city Alameda County does not feel at all
chagrined, for never before In her his
tory has such a majority been given for
any President, and many years has Ala
meda held the banner. It must be con
fessed that the Republicans of Alameda
County did not look upon San Francisco
as their ?onpetltor for the Republican,
banner. Their attention was directed to
ward L*>s Anpeles County, for this is the
only county In the State that has ever
wrested the jrecious bit of Fllk from Its
resting place with the Oakland Republican
j Alliance. The Republicans of Alameda
County were a little surprised in more
ways than one in this unlooked for out
come cf the election. In the first place, It
was hardly expected that Alameda Coun
ty would give much more than the 5000
i majority that It pave four years atro. In
the second place, it was thought that this
majority would ea*ily be more than any
possible majority that either San Fran
cisco or Los Angeles countier could give.
When the figures from Alameda County
bejran to come In last night and it was
seen that the McKinlev majority would
be nearly 6000. and when it climbed to 700")
and gave indications of reaching 7500, the
people of Alameda County thought that
the banner was absolutely safe, and they
went home w'th that idea firmly implant
ed In their mind*.
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.-Wlth a plu
rality of 7674 for William Mc-
Kinley, Alameda County was
ready to do battle with the
State for the Republican ban
ner that it has so often won before, but
when the returns from San Francisco be
gan to come in late this afternoon and It
was announced that the metropolis would
give McKinley between 11.000 and 12,000
plurality over Bryan Alameda County
took its political hat off to the larger city
But Oakland ls consoling Itself with the
fact that In no other county In the State
was a complete Republican ticket elected,
and that there ls but one office-holder In
the county not a Republican, that being
T. C. Crawford, Covnty Superintendent of
Schools, who was elected two years ago.
There was some trepidation in the Re
publican ranks over some of the candi
dates, but the only district that was the
least close was the First Supervisorial,
which ls normally Democratic, and where
Thomas D. Wells, the Democratic candi
date. Is a wonderfully popular man.'

FIGHT AGAINST

Le Conte was then called and went Into
a long detailed statement of the cost of
construction work of the Contra Costa
Company since 1^6. his estimates bein>Â»
based on data furnished to him by Engi
neer? Boardman and Hewson of the water
company. Because of Hayne'j vigorous
fight on the 1SS6 report, which covere 1
data upon work done before that year.
McCutchen abandoned his inquiry along
that line.
Dingee had no personal knowledge of
the way the two systems have been con
nected since the absorption.
Hayr.f continued to press Dingee upon
the number of consumers the Oakla Â¦ 1
company had. but the water magnate
could not answer
"Why." Dingee plaintively declared as
the ghost of the old rate war loomed up.
"sometimes there would be thirty sub
scribers a day cut off from our company
because the Contra Costa people offered
to supply them at 5 cents a month less."'
Dingee finally came to the conclusion
that there were about 9000 taps, of which
3fHXÂ» were not In service.
SlcCutchen said the engineer would use
it only as an aid in refreshing his mem
ory.
Hayne ascertained from Le Conte that
most of the data wa3 given to him by
Anthony Chabot. Judge Hart ruled la
Hayne's favor that the engineer could
not use the report for the purpose in
tended, because of the hearsay nature of
Its contents. But the water company waj
given the privilege o? introducing the doc
ument as Independrnt evidence, if the at
torneys deemed best.
The morning session opened with a con
tinuation of the cross-examination of Wil
liam J. Dingee. vice president of the Con
tra Costa water Company. Again was
demonstrated \he serious inconvenience,
to aay the least, that has been caused by
the destruction of the \arlous water com
panies' hooks that existed before the cor
porations were combined. Attorney Hayne
found that Mr. Dingee was not able to
give him much of the information he
t-oujcht. and Â¦which was lost, apparently,
at the incineration of the books. For In
stance. Mr. Hayne desired to know how
many consumers the Oakland Water Com
rany had in the city of Oakland. Mr.
Ungee could not tell, claiming there ha,!
been no segregation of those Inside ar.d
outside the city limits.
Mr. Dingee could not tell positively
what portion of Oakland was covered by
the Oakland Water Company's pipe sys
tem. Up thought that very much morij
than half the city was piped by that com
pany and he was sure that the system
had supplied relatively half of the con
sumers In the city prior to the consoli
dation.
"I do not know that the witnesa ob
tained any information from the City
Council while he was employed by the city
of Oakland."
But Hayne made one point stick fast.
When Le Conte produced an original oÂ£
his report, which he had preserved. Hayne
wanted to know where the information
came from that formed the basis of the
document.
Attorney McCutchen came to the em
barrassed engineer's relief by making a
lone argument about the difference be
tÂ»*Â»n Le Conte's attitude and thai of ti:o
lawyer, physician or clergyman to a
client. MeCutrhen insisted that I>Â» Conte"*
report, although made for the city, wa.* a
public record and that it could be utllUM
by anybody desiring :o reach it.
MoCutchen did not mention the fact that
the report b missing from the riles in the
City Clerk's office.
Judge Hart allowed Le Conte to testify.
Said his Honor:

poration. Not only did Attorney Hayne,
for the city, very strenuously object to Le
Conte' s appearance in that role, but thÂ«>
lawyer made a decided protest against tho
use by the expert of the very report he
had been paid by the city to make. Mr.
Hayne declared that no court of equity
should tolerate such a proceeding.

attention was attracted to . an article
r^a<5c<J 'Brawny Scots' Diet,' mentioning:
epps and Grape-Nut*. I carefully tested
tho new food and finally begjn Its use in
my family, with most pratlfylnR results.
"My little boy at that tinie was a pale,
rnaemlc child and very poorly nourished.
Now. thanks to Grape-Nuts, he ls as fine

v.lsh for. My own personal experience
moans much to me. For some years I

could not eat bread or any preparation of
Lolled wheat flour, such as cake or any
of the starchy preparations, without a fit
of indipmlon. sour stomach, costiveness
and headache.
"As soon as I quit that sort of food and
Â¦used Grape-Nuts, which has the starchy
part predlgrested, I began to recover. The
change has been remarkable. â¢ I formerly

duras. During some revolutionary dis
turbance he was shot to death by a Gov
ernment sentinel while walking' In the

was declined, and the United States Min
ister was directed to press for settlement.

to-day received a telegram from Charge
Everett at Guatemala City, saying that
he had received a message from the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs of Honduras in
forming him that the Government of Hon

of the indemnity claimed In the Pears
case.

The horses owned by Brown & LJger

Captain Hackett has araln turned over

tion of the spectators at Oakland track
yesterday. Willie Sink's Formero polled a
very strong vote, and running away ahead
of his ticket made the crack Easterners.
Favonius and Gonfalon, look sheepish.
Many apologies are due for the showing
made by the latter two horses, which
their constituents explain away by claim
ing neither is a "mudder." The course
was in a somewhat juicy condition, which
just seemed to be to the liking of For
mero. The route was over one mile and a
sixteenth, and Hildreth's Gonfalon, with
Bullman up, opened a 4 to 5 choice, with
8 to 5 about Favonius, the Morris entry-
Toward post time constant rubbing had
forced Formero's price from sixes down
to 7. to 2. The race needs little recital.-
Pedro Enos, astride the Sink horse, made
hot haste for the lead, heading Favonius
at the first crossroad. From that on he
enjoyed a gallop, beating Gonfalon at the
wire by three lengths In 1:49V2. a good per
formance. J. Daly, on Favonius, couldn't
help taking the show, for Snips, the only
other starter, was a block off
This was about the only event on the
card bearing any pretensions to class.
Good Hope". Sunello and Pat Morrissey
attached themselves to purses, going to
the post favorites in the betting.
Gloom overspread the features of the
backers of Louis Ezell's youngster. Sad
Sam. at the conclusion of the two-year
old number. Stories were told of how he
lived on a diet of mud pudding for thirty
days, and the Texan was heralded as the
real good thing of the afternoon. From
6 to 5 the odds fell to 3 to 5. and he was
outfooted home by Screenwell Lake, an
8 to 1 shot, piloted by Frawley. Barney
Schreiber*s Merida finished third.
Good Hope met a mediocre bunch at
seven furlongs, and closing a 3 to 5 fa
vorite paddled past the judges a winner
by two boat lengths. Clarando. the con
tender throughout, experienced no diffi
culty in taking place honors from Storm
King.
Mat Storn's Morello horse Sunello re
peated his victory of Monday in the mile
selling affair for three-year-olds. Going
Into the starter's hands about equal fa
vorite with Essence, condition told, and in
a drive J. Walsh landed him winner over
the last named starter by a head. .Bound
lee lost the show to Expedient.
In his element splashing through the
slop, Pat Morrissey galloped away with
the closing Bix furlong run. The gelding
was 7 to o in the ring, and finished two
lengths ahead of Imperious. Stuart put
up a ride on Tiburon, which finished third,
that caused some harsh criticism.

In the final Echo met R. L. Taylor's

picked to win the stake and she did not
disappoint the wise ones.
The people of Modesto are making great
preparations to receive the members of
the Interstate Coursing Club, which holds
Its annual meet on the plains in that vi
cinity next week. A grand ball and bar
becue are a few of the events being ar
ranged in the coursing men's- honor. A
large delegation from this city will at
tend the meet. S The stake will have the
largest number of contestants that ever
took part in a field event In this State.
Eighty and probably ninety-six dogs will
compete. Â«
Following are the scores and result of
yesterday's midweek stake:

Until they could hardly stand. The hare
might have been running yet but for the
management turning four dogs into the
field to catch it. For a few minutes the
field was tilled with racing hounds and
this afforded much excitement for the
spectators.
The defeat of Hot Foot by Lady Glen
kirk at 7 to 1 was the sensation of the
day. Hot Foot led to the hare by eight
lengths. The jack proved an unusually
strong one and almost flew over the
ground. Lady Glenklrk got in and out-

Curtis & Son's black and white Echo
won the midweek reserve stake at Union
Coursing Park yesterday In clever fash
ion. Her work was of high class and re
dounds to the credit of her trainer.
It was not an-idqal coursing day, for
spectators. It was cold and foggy, and
the view of many of the races was ob
scured by the Impenetrable mist. Despite
the rain in the morning and the
bleakness of the atmosphere, there
was a fairly gxiod attendance. Bet
ting was lively and the frequency with
which the short-enders scored flags made
grlad the hearts and pockets of the bettors.
The "talent" was greatly puzzled
throughout the day. The latter counted
on the speed of the dogs to cash their
checks, but they did not count on the
hares. The long-ears had been fed on dry
feed and were in grand fettle. They led
the dogs around the field in almost every
course before they were. caught.
Chicago Boy and Belle Claire ran the best
course of the day. After traversing the
entire length of the field in the wake of
a fast jack, the dogs killed and Judge
Grace declared It to Â¦â¢ be an undecided.
When the pair were slipped a second time
they ran evenly, Chicago Boy barely beat
ing his rival out by a point. Score. 4 to 3.

John Douglass, a carpenter In the Cor
poration Yard, is authority for the state
ment that the lightning which flashed
across this city yesterday morning struck
the figure on the dome of the New City
Hall with a terrific force. Douglass states
that the impact of the lightning against
the bronze metal was so dazzling that it
quite blinded him for the space or several
seconds. " . . .
Douglass says he was standing on the
steps of the Mechanics' Pavilion about 7
o'clock, preparatory to going to his labors
in the Corporation Yard, which is located
on City Hall avenue. All at once the
lightning came and struck the metal fig
ure, accompanied by a reverberating
noise. Douglass was obliged, to take his
eyes off the dome immediately.

Manager Fillmore stated yesterday after
noon that a hearing would be given the

not meet them this week, as he expects to

As already stated In The Call, the rail
road men came to this cltv three weeks
ago to confer with the Southern Pacific
officials relative to the adoption of a new
working schedule, the old one, compiled
in 1S92. having been outgrown by reason of
extensions and a general expansion of the
company's service.
The new schedule that was presented
embodied fifty-three different articles,
each of which had to be gone over sep
arately. "There were many things which
the men asked for wMch they didn't ex
pect to get. so they were not disappointed
when I refused to consider them," said
Mr. Flllmore yesterday. "However."
added the Pacific Coast manager, '"the
main feature of the new schedule, includ
ing a readjustment of the working hours,
a better clarification of pay and a pro
vision for promoting employes according
to their time of service and general com
petency, have been granted and I think
a majority of the men are satisfied. An
eight-hour work day will prevail."
It is likely that the new schedule will
go into effect December 1.
HALF BATES FOR CLERGYMEN".
Transcontinental Association Will
Act on Matter Next Week.
E. O. McCormlck, general passenger
manager of the Southern Pacific, will at
tend an adjourned meeting of the Trans
continental Passenger Association In St.
Louis next week. One of the important
questions to be decided, and one which
has considerable local interest, will be the
fixing of rates for clergymen. Sisters of
Charity and others engaged exclusively
in religious work.
Passenger officials of several Western
railroads have been discussing this ques
tion with much seriousness of late, some
of the railroad men having declared that
the custom of making reduced rates on
account of the religious followlngs of
individuals should be abolished.
Mr. McCormlck Is in favor of a liberal
policy in dealing with the clergy. "They
have always received the benefit of half
fare on our lines," said he, "and I think
the Transcontinental Association will ap
prove our policy. We- expect to adopt a
plan, however, which will simplify tho
task of obtaining a cut rate and at the
Eame time prevent imposition, on the part
of parties not legitimately entitled to the
company's benevolence.
"Heretofore a clergyman has been
obliged to secure letters from all the dif
ferent roads over which he is to nas3 be
fore being able to obtain a ticket at re
duced rates. The new plan Is to have the
ticket agent In the clergyman's native
city or town make out the pass. The
agent being familiar with the people in
his own city, knows at once if the apoli
c?r i is entitled to a reduced fare. The
card will give the bearer the benefit of
acut rate on any line connected with the
Transcontinental Association."
Employes Make Independent Request
for New Schedule and Will Be
Given Hearing Next Week.
SWITCHMEN BOLT THE
RAILWAY GATHERING
The three weeks' conference between
Manager J. A- Flllmore, the division su
perintend ent of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, and twenty-five delegates, repre
senting all the conductors, brakemen and
yardmen in the employ of the company,
came to a E'jdden and not altogether sat
isfactory termination yesterday. It seems
the switchmen, who are members of the
Railway Men's Assocatlon, which Is con
ducting the case, were dissatisfied with
the way their Interests were being looked
after, so they decided to wage their battle
independently. This meant the striking
out of all matters pertaining to the
switchmen In the new schedule- and the
action is said to have so upset the dele
pates who represented the interests of the
conductors, brakemen and yardmen that
they abruptly adjourned, pending devel
opments on the part of the switchmen.
Befote the shadows of night began to
hang over the big yellow building on
Montgomery street a long document was
handed Manager Pillmore. It was signed
by the represenratives of the Switchmen's
Unions in this city and Oakland, and the
wording over the eignatures in substance
asked lor a hearing relative to a'read
justment of the switchmen's working
echedule and classification of pay. Mean
while It is the intention of the switch
men to draw up a schedule of their own
end the merit of the articles to he con
tained therein will be personally described
by the unions' own representatives.
This action on the part of the switch
men may Ix? the forerunner of a similar
movement on the pan of the company's
switchmen in lx>s Angeles and Sacra
mento. The switchmen of this city and
Oakland number between 200 and 300
which, in their opinion, ought to make
en organization sufficiently strong to fight
their cause independent of the Railway
Men's Association. What effect the ac
tion of th^ switchmen will have upon the
association is a question. Should the con
ductors, brakemen and yardmen follow
the example set by the switchmen and
present their grievances independently
the association would have to go out of
existence.

BRYAN'S defeat was a sorry
event for William Watson. It
not only was the means of
landing him behind prison bars,
but it stopped work on a three
story building and kept Policeman O'Shea
busy for an hour trying to straighten out
a perplexing question.
Here is the tale. Watson was an en
thusiastic Bryanlte. He was confident
that the free sliver advocate would bo
chosen to move his trunk into the White
House. When his friend, Mike Noonan,
dared to suggest that William McKlnley
had a lease on the Executive Mansion for
four years to come, Watson showed his
true sporting feather and made this
bet:
"If Mac wins out. Mike, I'll haul you in
a wheelbarrow the length of Market
street."
The battle was over and Mike hunted
up his human motive power yesterday.
He was anxious to go to the ferry, and
while the ride might be a little slow,
still carfare would be saved and his
judgment over Watson's would be de
clared triumphant.
What puzzled Watson was where a
wheelbarrow could be secured. He over
came this difficulty easily when he came
to a three-story building that was In the
course of construction on Market street,
near Sixth. A brick carrier was held up
and stood speechless for a few moments
as he watched Noonan take the place of
a load of bricks and Watson wheel him
away. The loss of the wheelbarrow was
too much for the builders, and it crippled
the advancement of their work.
The boss of the gang Joined a crowd of
small boys that followed the bettors down
Market street and. when he approached

Butterworth is detailed to assist the
Board of Health and has to a certain ex
tent acted as milk inspector. Early last
Monday morning his wife went as usual
to the front door to bring in the milk from
the porch. On opening the can Mrs. But
terworth discovered a red fluid floating on
top of the milk. She Immediately threw
the milk away. Later in the morning
Butterworth s mother went to wash the
front steps and found that where the can
had been standing the paint was all burn
ed away by contact with some acid. Fur
ther investigation proved that some per
son had run up the stairs, poured an acid
into the mllkcan, evidently sulphuric acid
and bychromote of potash, and In his
haste had spilled It over the can. the
steps and the front sidewalk. The matter
was reported to the police, who are inves
tigating the case.
Butterworth and his wife are very
happy that they discovered the poison
when they did. as the breakfast of their
three small children is largely composed
of milk. Butterworth has no clew to the
miscreant who attempted the deed, but he
Is under the impression that he will re
turn, and is prepared to give him a very
warm reception.
Policeman John "W. Butterwrorth does
not sleep any more at night. He Is to bo
found seated by the parlor windows of his
home, at 2415 Folsom street, at all hours
when off duty, keeping a constant watch
on his front door steps. He hopes that
the person who poured what he thinks
was poison Into his mllkcan will return
and again attempt to kill off his whola
family, and that he will be able to cap
ture the miscreant in the act and land
him behind the bars.
