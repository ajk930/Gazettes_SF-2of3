T"IE Grand Duke Vladlmlr-Alexandrovltch, who in all probability will be
Ilcgent in the event of the death of Nicholas II before the birth of an
expected heir, is one of the most popular members of the Russian reign-*
Ing family, and is the eldest: surviving brother of the late Czar Alexander.
Vladimir was born at St. Petersburg In April. 1S47. In 1S74 he was mar
ried to Marie Paulovna of Mecklenburg-Schwerln. an aunt of the young Duke who
is affianced to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.
In the event of the Czar's death and the birth of a posthumous son the re
gency of the Grand Duke Vladimir will be a long one. In the other event, that
the fourth child is a Princess, the regent would forthwith give way to his nephew,
the hereditary Grand Duke Michael, the Ru3sian law of succession precluding
females from the throne, except in the case of the absence of any male of the
11ns.

KICHTZB SCORES THE KAISER.
The United States desires the punish
ment of the principal offenders in such
*'Â»'Â¦' as will serve as a warning to Chin
ffc in the future. It seeks reasonable in
demnityâone that China can payâ and It
wants the withdrawal of the international
troops. On none of ;h*>se points Is this
Government in accord with Great Britain
and Germany.
So far as our Government is advised,
the Ministers at Peking have not agreed
upon all points under discussion. Thev
are believed to be engaged now with the
difficult subjects of indemnities and
guarantees.
It is apparent to officials that the G*r
man Government will not be satisfied with
moderate punishment, such as would
meet the natural requirements of civili
zation, but Is determined to shed more
blood even though such action would
probably solidify the Chinese in their op
position to foreigners.
Gr*at Eritaln in connection with the pun
ishment of Boxer leaders. These reports
raid that the decree issued by the Chinese
Emperor, dated November 13. imposing
punishment on anti-foreign Prince* and
cJSclals had created a very bad Impression
in Berlin, and as Germany does not now
move without the sanction cf Great Bri
tain and vice versa, it Is presumed here
that the London Oovemment regrards the

dizzy pace. Engineer Ryan stuck to the
throttle, trying In vain to save the train
from its certain destruction. It was ab

out of solid rock and the decline Is so
steep that the mountain looks as If It was
terraced with tracks. A leap meant
death. In less than five minutes the crash
came. The train struck a reversed curve.
The locomotive leaped off the rails and
was thrown lengthwise across the track.
i Twelve cars loaded with coal and coke

could not escape and went down with the
engine and beneath the dozen cars loadei

bruised about the body, but will recover.
Dow and Reed were also caught in the
wreck and probably fatally hurt.
The three men were taken to Sallda. tha
injured men being placed in the com

at work all day endeavoring to extricate
Brasswell from beneath the wreck, so
thoroughly had the cars wedged upon the
engine. Not until late to-night was the
wreck cleared and the body of Brasswell

There have been air sorts of reports to

here and the whereabouts of Brown re
mains a mystery- No reward has yet
been offered for his apprehension.
The clerks of the German National
Bank, who are working with Receiver
Tucker's experts, to-day discovered an
other plan operated by Brown. When a
check -was entered October 31 for $3 45 he
entered it as $300 45 and got the benefit of
$3000. On the same date he put "2" In
front of an entry for $150 and got $2000
more. The experts say that Brown re
peatedly credited himself with one, two
and three thousand dollar deposits when
he did not deposit anything, but took out
the amount soon afterward. Brown's
books show that he did not steal sums less
than $1000 in any of these transactions. Â»

pense, and this may perhaps be the last

Maurice Grau said last evening that he
had Just received a telegram from Sarah
Bernhardt stating that she. had arrived
safely in New York. "I wish you would
state," he said, "that Sarah Bernhardt
will be out here In February. I am sure
that she will please the San Francisco
people. The sale of seats in New York
for her appearance Is larger than ever

"Oh this boat, this boat," she said over
and over. "1 want to get ashore. I can
not read or write or talk on this boat."
Then she made rolling motions with her
two hands to show how the boat had be
haved. Her anxiety to get ashore created
the impression that she had been seasick
on the voyage, but the ship's doctor said
she was a good sailor and made no
trouble. The voyage was very rough dur
ing the. first four days, however, and all
aboard were made nervous by the con
stant shaking and tossing of the ship.
To a Call representative Bernhardt
would not discuss her roles In detail.
Asked which one she preferred she an
swered, "I like best the one that I am
playing at the time." Then her opinion
of M. Rostand's sanity was sought. She
gave it freely.
"He never was crazy," she said. "The
other writers are jealous of him and have
defamed him. He is not the greatest play
wright, but he is one of the greatest.
"Miss Adams â yes, I hear that she is a
charming girl, charming creature. Her
personation of L'Aiglon Is excellent."
Borne one suggested that Miss Adams
did not put enough of tragedy Into the
part, but Bernhardt could not be Induced
to venture any but a general criticism of
the American girl.
"I do not like it." she v said petulantly.
"The face is too short. My face Is easy
to draw. It Is very long and ugly and has
thin bones. Then she passed the picture
back to have the face made longer.
Bernhardt was arrayed In an outfit of
brown. Her dress was plain, but her
gown ox. rich fur swept the deck as she
courtesied to the reporters. She was a
picture that tempted an artist. As she
talked he sketched her and she watched
with a half smile as he worked. The
artist became nervous, but went on brave
ly. At last he finished and passed the
sketch up to her for an opinion.
Madame Bernhardt looked the picture
of health and smiled and bowed farewell
to the reporters who had accompanied her
from quarantine, as she took the arm of
Marcus Mayer, and, leading her two fox
terriers, "Mr. and Mrs. Dennis," tripped
to the open victoria which was in wait

crowd of hackmen and porters, but be
sides there were many persons drawn
thither by the hope of seeing the great

when she saw that she was walking in

fur and displayed her shapely ankles.
At that the crowd pressed so close that
the police had to swing their clubs and

NEW YORK," Nov. 20.â A special
from Charlestown. N. H.. 3&ys:
Charles H. Hoyt, the well-known
playwright, died at his home
: here to-night of paresis, from
I which he has been suffering for several
I months past. Ever since his return to
i Charlestown aft > his release from a prl
j vate asylum at Hartford, by order of the
court early in August, it has been known
by his attendants and nearest triends
that his condition was serious and there
was little or no chance for his reco\cry.
but Mr. Hoyt apparently had seemed
hopoful of ultimate recovery.
Previous to two weeks ago there ap
pears to have been a slight improvement
in his condition although he had periods
of depression. About two weeks ago his
appetite /ailed and he had a bad turn,
from which .he only partially recovered
Since that time he had been unable to
take any except liquid nourishment, but
continued to be up and around his rooms
until yesterday. He steadily lost strength
and this morning he Buffered a relapse
and became unconscious, in which condi
tion he remained until death came.
Mr. Hoyt had no relatives here and at
the time of his death his two physicians,
two trained nurses, his valei and James
O. Lyford. his legal guardian, were in at
tendance.
The funeral arrangements will not be
made until to-morrow, but it is probable
that the funeral will be. held Sunday.
Charles H. Hoyt was born in Concord.
N. H., during the early days of th-> Civil
War. He gained a little early schooling
in his native city and then attended the
Boston Latin School for two years. His
father, a man of some means, believea
that a more practical education could be
secured in travel and observation than
from books, so young Hoyt spent several
years in wandering about the country.
For a time he studied law in the office
of Chief Justice Cushing at Chartestown,
N. H. He gave up law to accept a tem
porary position on the St. Alban's Ad
vertiser, and acquitted himself ?o v/ell
that he attracted the attention of the
editor of the Boston Post. He acce.ptco
a position on that paper, and as editor of
the "All Sorts" column gained a reputa
tion as an extremely bright and witty
writer.
His first dramatic effort was called
"Glfford's Luck," a skit which had some
success on the road. Soon followed "A
Bunch of Keys," which made an instan
taneous hit. Then ne wrote "A Parlor
Match," another piece which proved re
markably successful, u>r Evans and Hoey.
It was played in every city of the country
continuously for twelve years arid up to
the death, of Hoey. Hoyt's next effort
was "A Rag Baby," and. In spite of ths
success of his two previous works, tho
play went a-begging tor some time.
. Manager after manager returned tho
manuseript'of the young playwright. Fi
nally he became disgusted and deter
mined, with his partner, Charles Thomas.
to put the play on at his own. risk. The
two young men had saved some money,
but not enough to stage the play. They
finally induced Manager Eugene Tomp
kins to take a third interest in the play,
and It was produced and made a success
even greater than its predecessors.
During all this time Hoyt retained his
connection with the Boston Post. The
great success of his plays convinced him,
however, that his proper field lay in that
direction, and he resigned from the paper
to devote his entire time to theatrical
management. "A Tin Soldier" was hlh
next production, and it met with the same
success as those which had gone before.
His name Â¦was known to theater-goers
all over the country, ana everything he
wrote seemed to catch the popular fancy
at once. In rapid succession came "A
Midnight Bell," "A Texas Steer" and "A
Trip to Chinatown." The latter farce was
one of his greatest successes. It ran for
666 consecutive performances at Hoyt's
Theater, now the Madison Square, In New
Yprk.
Hoyt continued to turn out wonderfully
successful skits with a most prolific pen.
"A Temperance Town," "A Milk Whice
Flag," "A Black Sheep," "A Contented
Woman" and "A Stranger In New York"
were all practical successes and money
makers. It Is said that during one season
of "A Trip to Chinatown" Mr. Hoyt's In
come was about 1133.000.
Mr. Hoyt in 18S7 married Flora Walsh,
known to theater-goers throughout the
country as Bossy In "A Texas Steer." She
died in 1833, and In 1S94 he married Caro
line Mlskel. She was in one of Hoyfi?
plays, and as Caroline Miekel-Hoyt was
known as one of the most beautiful wo
men on the stage. Mrs. Hoyt died in Oc
tober, 1898. and from that time Mr. Hoyt
seemed a broken man.
He was always extremely nervous, and
shortly after bis wife's death his condi
tion became alarming. He suffered a se
vere attack of nervous prostration. Mor
bidly grieving over the death of hlsÂ« wife,
he plunged into work which completely
wrecked his health. He spent several
months in St. Augustine. Fla., and to a
certain extent regained his health. Ho
never recovered his former brilliancy,
however, and wrote his only complete
failureâ "A Dog in a Manger. '* The fail
ure of this play, which was produced for
a few nights In Boston, completely dis
couraged nlm. He brooded more and more
over the death of hla wife and his condi
tion became such that he was finally ex
amined as to his sanity. The scene In
court was pathetic In the extreme. Hoyt
seemed to partially realize his condition,
but his nervous system waa so wrecked
and his once brilliant mind so ravaged by
worry and sorrow that he could not com
bat the terrible affliction which was .upon
him. Mournfully he repeated his wife's
name, explaining to the Judge that sineÂ©
her death he had been unable to sleep, he
could get ,no rest. He was officially pro
nounced Incompetent and committed to an
asylum. . A few weeks later, through the
efforts of his friends, he was released and
taken to a private sanitarium. ;
Passing of a Comedian.
Joseph Ott. the comedian, died heie last

He played'hls first Important part when
about twenty years old In a short run in
Boston. In recent years he Ftarred in -ths

"Star Gazing." More than a . year ago

"The United States," said Mr. Fischer.
"remains a force in the councils of civ

eventually be exercised in bringing the
war to such an end as will protect our

NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â Passengers on
board the steamer Advance, which ar
rived hf re to-day from Colon, confirm the
reports of the seizure of the British
steamer Taboea at Colon. The rebels
threatened to block the port of Buena
Ventura and the Government vessel had
broken down. They seized the Taboga to
transfer troops to Buena Ventura. An of
fer of $l'i.0"0 was made for the vessel prior
to seizure. The Government is quite will

KINGSTON'. Jamaica. Nov. 20.â It has
been ascertained that a fortnight ago the
Colombian Government was negotiating
with the Pacific Navigation Company for
the purchase of one of its coast steamers
for war purposes. In consequence of the
rebel activity and the advance of the
rebel forces on Panama that city was
placed under marital law November 10.
The steamer Tnbnga is believed to have
|>een pent November 13 to bring reinforce
ments from the coast. But it is not posi
tively known Â¦whether the Taboga was
teized by the Colombian Government.
The Ta-boga, with the Government
troops on board, arrived at Buena Ven
tura yosterda.y, whereupon the Liberals
retired.
PANAMA, Colombia, Xov. 20.â The seiz
ure of the British steamer Taboga by the
Colombian Government was due to the
Tact that the, agent of the Pacific Steam
rCavigation Company, to which she be
toceed. refused to sell or charter the ves
lel for the purpose of conveying Govern
ment troops to Buena Ventura, which was
besieged by the Liberals. Therefore the
Government decreed the seizure of the
Ete^mer and proceeded to the relief of
Buena Ventura with troops, ammunition
and provisions. The British Consul here,
L\ Mallet, entered a strong protest against
the seizure of the steamer, but it was of
no avail. He then communicated with his
Government on the subject. No reply has
been received from lÂ»ndon.

the French welcome is chiefly engineered
by the anti-ministerial party, thus de
tracting immensely from Its political im
portance.
Messrs. Fischer and Wessels. who were
interviewed this afternoon, expressed re

pared it with their reception in the United
States. Both Insisted, however, that the
is felt.
The Boer delegates fully appreciate the
advantage accruing to their cause when
MARSEILLES, Nov. 20.â Former
President Kruger will probably
land here Thursday instead of
to-morrow. Bad weather is re
ported in the Mediterranean,
and the Dutch cruiser Gelderland, on
which he !s a passenger, may hug the
coast of the Gulf of Genoa in preference
to heading direct for Marseilles, so as to
avoid the cross seas. She will thus reach
this port to-morrow evening Instead of
to-night. Every preparation, however,
has been made for Mr. Kruger's possible
landing to-morrow morning. The police
and military are held in readiness and the
Boer reception committee has not made
any change in the arrangements for the
reception at the dock. Workmen have
been busy erecting flagstaff's along the
waterside at La Joi'ette and at the oufer
deck, where the steam launcn with Mr.
Kruger on board will land.
It is certain that Mr. Kruger's arrival
will be the occasion for a great popular
demonstration along the route from the
dock to the hotel, which is situated on
the principal boulevard, known as the
Cannebiere. It is equally certain that the
formal proceedings will not be invested
with the importance which the occasion
warrants, owing to the abstention from
them of the Prefect, Mayor and other
functionaries in their official capacity.
A surprise came to-day in the shape of
the arrival here of Eloff, Mr. Kruger's
private secretary, who left the Gelderland
f<t Port Said and came ahead on a French
steamer. Eloff left Mr. Kruger in perfect
health and spirits. The President occu
pies three cabins situated in the stern of
the Gelderland. His dining-room is deco
rated v.ith the portraits of the Dutch
royal family, a picture of .Queen Wilhel
mina 'being in the place of honor.
The Boer delegates, Messrs. Fischer,
Wessels and Grobner. who have also ar
rived here, expressed to the representa
tive of the Associated Press their earnest
wish to have the American people Â¦with
them in their efforts to secure a termina
tion of the war. They said they knew Mr.
Kruger also appreciated American sym
pathy and hoped it would lead to practical
favors to the cause of his country.
The delegates, however, were unable to
eay exactly what Mr. Kruger would de
cide to do after landing in France. There
is much talk in Marseilles to the effect
that a counter demonstration will occur
or that anti-English outcrys may be
raised, which would result ir. street dis
orders. But neither the Prefect nor the
American consulate officials attach the
<=lightrpt importance to these rumors.
A pro-Boer committee has issued an ap
peal, copies of which were posted this aft
ernoon, calling on the people to cheer for
Mr. Kruger and the Boers, but to refrain i
from ?ny anglophobe demonstration.
"The crowd in the streets to witness the
arrival of Mr. Kruger." said the Prefect
of the department to-day, "will probably
exceed 100.000. which is a fifth of the popu
lation of Marseilles. Nevertheless, no dis
order, in my opinion, will occur. The
sympathies of the inhabitants are un
doubtedly with the Boers, and Mr. Kruger
will receive a rousing reception here. Ex
cept for a few isolated cries against Ens- I
land, which it will be impossible to pre
vent, but which will be promptly re
pressed if the peaceful character of the
demonstration seems to be in any way
jeopardized, we expect nothing that would
offend the' English. We live her* 1 on the
best- terms with the English -colony and
wish to remain so. Mr. Kruger will meet
with such an official reception as is given
to a chief of state when he travels in
cognito."
M. Flassiers. "the Mayor of Marseilles,
expressed himself in similar terms, bu f
this optimism is not shared entirely. ,by
some members of the English colony, who
have discerned paid agents of the Anglo
phobe cause among some of the recent ar
rivals.
The Prefect, however, is known to be
an energetic man. He has taken strong
military precautions, and the. garrison,
numbering about 6000 men, will be held
in readiness, but out of sight at the in

Eow Do You Like This New FadP
Vegetarians, anti-coffee drinkers and
food <rank5 of every description must
row take a hack seat, for a new fad has
the floor.
A society has recently been formed, the
members cf -which plÂ«*dge themselves to
eat no food whatever that has been cook-
rd. They claim that uncooked food is the
only rational healthful diet: that our re-
mote ancestors ate no cooked food and
therefore if we do the came vigor and
health will be our reward.
Raw meat, raw potatoes, raw wheat
raw egg?, raw everything, is the enticing
bill of fare held out to the enthusiastic
food crank of tho future, and the society
proposes to establish restaurants In the
larger cities whore this delightful menu
may be served daily.
Modern cooking !s often a dyspepsia
producer, because we fry so many foods
which should be baked, roasted broiled
or boiled; fried food is? Indigestible - be-
cause each particle of food in incased Jn
hot grease, which the digestive juices of
the stomach cannot easily penetrate; but
properly cooked food is more easily di-
pected than the same food uncooked and
we predict for the new fad a very limited
following.
The real cause of indigestion is the lack
rf Hydrochloric acid and prptoncs in the
Ftomach. fo that no matter how well
cooked the food it cannot he well digested
unlÂ»fs the gastric juice is abundant and
contains the necessary amount of pep-
tones to dissolve the food.
Therefore the most sensible cure for
poor digestion Is to take after each meal
some safe and reliable digestive like
Stuart's Dyspepsia TaJsIets. which supply
peptones to digest the meat and eggs and
diastase to digest the bread, potatoes and
similar starchy foods.
Laxative medicines never cure Indiges-
tion, because they have no digestive effect
whatever upon the food: on the other
hand, if the food is properly digested
there will be no need of laxatives. Good
digestion does away with constipation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain pure
aseptic pepsin (government test) diastase
and the digestive elements which weak
stomachs lack, and they cure Indigestion
by assisting the overworked, rundown sto-
mach in its hard work until It Is restored
to its normal condition, when the tablets
ire no longer needed; but there are thou-
Â«ar.ds of robust men and women who
never eat a meal without" taking one or
two of Stuart's Tablets, because by *o
doing they can eat what they please and
when they please and be free from any
bad after effects.
Â£tuart'Â» Dyspeptic Tablets are cold by
druscieti everywhere In the- United
auxee, Canada asd Great Britain^-

VANCOUVER. Nov. 20.â Tenas Albert
Toung, the best known white hunter of
the Harrison Lake district and officially
adopted son of the chief of the Douglas
Indians, met a horrible death last Satur
day as the culmination of a long and ter
rible fight with a grizzly bear. The details
were received here to-day by Indian Agent
Frank Devlin, an Indian runner having
brought out a letter containing the news
from Anderson Lake, which Is 150 miles
from Vancouver.
. Two months ago the entire tribe of In
dians In that vicinity was on the verge
of starvation and sent piteous appeals for
aid to the local Indian department. Num
bers of their cattle had been drowned by
disastrous floods, which had caused Har
rison River to overflow its banks and In
undate the adjacent low ly!r!g country.
So much famine and pestilence had over
taken the unfortunate tribe that the In
dians were convinced that the hand of the
Manitou was against them. Now that tho
hope of the tribe â :he adopted white son
of the chiefâ has perished, the last vesfgo
of their courage has departed. The letter
to Indian Agent Devlin states that the
young hunter was away up the side of
the mountain above the village when his
dogs scented a grizzly bear, which was
encamped for the winter In a hollow
stump. The grizzly was a large female.
Or.ce disturbed, she was soon thoroughly
aroused and enraged and made straight
for the hunter. Young nred two shots,
one of which evidently missed, while the
other broke the bear's left shoulder. By
that time the grizzly was upon him, and
In trying to beat a retreat Young dis
carded his gun. He had barely time to
snatch his long hunting knife from his
belt before the grizzly grappled with him.
Evidently the hunter used his knife to
gocd effect, for the snow crust upon the
spot where occurred the fight for life was
red with the bear's blood.
The scene of the conflict was within a
few yards of one of tho steep precipices
often found In the Cascade Mountains.
During the progress of the ftsrht man and
bear unconsciously approached nearer the
edge cf the cliff. The hunter's hat and a
portion of his ccat were subsequently
found there, havlrsr been torn off In tlio
struggle. Then locked In what proved to
be the death struggle the hunter and the
grizzly must have slipped over the edge,
for the bruised and battered bodies wera
found en Sunday by a search party of
Indians at the foot of the cliff. 600 feet
below. There was hardly an unbroken
bone in the young cm>fs body when it
was brought in for burial.

Forecast Official A. G. McAdle of the
United States weather bureau, In discus
sing the downpour yesterday, said:
The Etorm Is quits a remarkable one as
showing the effect of an area of high pressure
in preventing the eastward movement of an
area of low pressure. The large area of de
pression on the Pacific Coast was first noted
last Thursday evening, and that has remained
T-ith us now five days, and is still only about
300 or 400 miles inland from the coast.
Rain or enow haa fallen over the entire coun
try west of the Rocky Mountains. The rain
will extend to Mexico and Lower California,
A very Interesting feature of the combination
of the high and the low pressure approaching
bo closely is the heavy snowfall along thÂ«>
lines where the barometric gradients are steep
est. The cold wave Is pushing southward, and
freezing weather prevails over nearly all the
country west of tne Rocky Mountains, except
along the coast of California and In the valleys
and Southern Arizona. At altitudes above 1000
feet snow has fallen generally in Northern
Storm warnings were displayed to-day along
the entire Pacific Coast ThÂ« storm has been
of untold value to tho State, and gives us a
ectlfifactory supply of water. That it has im
proved an the crops is evident from the cheer
ful reports received by the bureau from all
sections of the State.
Following Is an extract from Mr. Mc-
Adle's report on the storm:
During the early part of the week thÂ«
Â¦weather continued warm and cloudy, or partly
clcudy. Rain commenced falling on the 16th
In the central end northern portions, extending
southward and covering the entire State by
the 17th, the precipitation continuing: in nearly
all sections up to the 19th. accompanied by
cooler weather. This has been the heaviest
rainfall of the season, and in some sections
the heaviest for two or three years. The bene
fit to all agricultural interests Is inestimable,
as It gives new life to fruit trees and vines.
Increases the water supply Jn tho districts of
scanty rainfall, softens the soil for Immediate
cultivation and revives pasturage and early
sown grain. In a few places in the northern
coaet section the soil has become too wet for
present cultivation, but in all other sections
plo-wlne and seedlne will now be -crowded for
ward with vigor, with good prospects for the
largest acreage of grain for several years.
Orange picking has been temporarily bus
ponded In some localities owing to the rain,
but the crop has not been Injured, and prospects
continue good for an unusually heavy yield in
mil citrus districts. Walnut picking is com-
I pleted. the crop having matured about two
weeks earlier than usual.
LOGAN SAFE AND SOTTNIX
Report That She Turned Turtle in
the Gale Unfounded.
While the wind was blowing a terrific
gale and the rain . was coming down: in
torrents a report went abroad last night
that the transport Logan had turned over
in the big drydock at Hunters Point.
Sergeant Lewis and Policeman Henley
of the South San Francisco police station
drove post haste to the scene of the sup
posed accident.
The officers arrived at the dock shortly
before midnight and instead of finding a
wrecked transport and everything in a
state of excitement they were surprised
to see the big boat calmly resting with
her top right side up and her men peace
fully snoozing. The crew was as much
surprised to hear the story of \the alleged
mishap as they would have been had it
really taken place. â¢ Â¦
two hours eight alarms were turned In. all
of which were caused by the crossing ol
wires. : - Â¦ . â¢ 'â¢
Between 7 and 8 p. Â¦ m. the department
answered two alarms; in the next hour
the engines were called out twice, and be
tween 9 and 10 p. m. they ran out for four
false alarms. In each and every case the

STOSM XING DISPORTS
ON OAKLAND STREETS
Oak Tree and. .Telegraph Poles
Knocked. Down and Horse Killed
by Live Wire.
OAKLAND, Nov. 20.â A gale of wind
and heavy rain to-night wrecked enough
of the electric light wires to leave Oak
land In partial darkness and to cut off
Berkeley, which Is supplied from the Oak
land Gas Light ' and Heat Company's
plant in this city.- The storm demoralized
the telephone system, played havoc with
signs and awnings and caused at least
two dangerous accidents. Shortly aJtter
10 o'clock In a particularly heavy gale the
immense false front on the newly re
modeled Bacon building at Twelfth and
Washington streets was swept oft Its sup
ports. The heavy wooden frame work
ripped oft tne cornice work along the roof
eaves and toppled over on to the mass of
telegraph and telephone wires along the
Twelfth-street side of the building. A
large portion of the roof was smashed
and ripped up by the violent wind.
Trees were blown down In all sections
of the city. At Fifth and Madison streets
a large oak toppled over, carrying electric
light wires with It. Frank Silva. a driver
for Buchanan's dairy, was crossing Sev
enth and Madison streets with his wagon
when his horse stepped on a live arc light
wire. Tne animal was Instantly killed.
Silva jumped and escaped Injury. Police
men guarded the dangerous wire until the
circuit could be cut out and the Gas Com
pany, which handles the electric lighting:
as well, cut off the circuits as fast as re
ports of broken wires were made. This
left half the city In darkness. Repairs
could not be made to either the city or
the Berkeley lines to-night, because of
the extreme danger In which the line men
would be placed.

CRESCENT CITY. Nov. 20.â Walter
Brooking, a young man of Smith Kiver,
has disappeared. Two hundred men have
for several days prosecuted an unavailing
search for him, and the hope that he
might yet be found alive has about been
abandoned.
Paul Frederick, whose bachelor abode is
on "N'lnchuck River, which has its coursa
near the boundary line between California
and Oregon In a mountainous region
where there Is an ubundanct of game, on
Monday visited Smith River and Invited
Brooking to his ranch for a few days'
hunting. To the ranch by way of mo
wagon road is a distance or twenty miles,
but as the crow niea the route is short
ened to five miles. Frederick, having a
wagon and team, necessarily had to tako
the longer route, while Brooking decided
to try tne short cut through the densely
timbered mountains. Brooking started
early in the afternoon, expecting to reach
Frederick's place within a few hours.
Since that time he has not been seen.
A party of about lifty men was oreran
lzed and spent the night pressing its way
Into the almost impenetrable forest. The
next day the searching party was rein
forced by men from the various logging
camps, and each day since the force has
been augmented until two hundred men
are participating in the Bearch.
There are many theories respecting the
misfortune that has befallen the young
man. That he became bewildered and lost
his way is scarcely likely, as he was a
sportsman and from his boyhood had
hunted through these mountains. He had
with him his rifle and a young hound,
which also is missing. Some believe that
Brooking has been murdered by an In
dian and that to effectually conceal the
crime the dog also was killed.
W'alttr Brooking: was the son of Mr. and
Mrs. James Brooklnp. He was SO years
of ace. Relatives of the young man re

Epecial Dlc^atch to The CalL
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 20.â Captain Far
celius of the schooner Azalea, which ar
:i\ed bere yesterday from Port Blakeley.
I rings news of a probable mutiny on the
i.'hilean bark Latona.
â¢â¢When we returned to Port Blakeley
niter our usual trip to San Diego." said
Captain FanJellus, "we found the Chilean
Laxk Latona in port, laden with lumber
and ready for sea. The captain of the
l^atcna is a Scov:hrnan and the lirst offi
cer a Norwegian, while the second officer
t-nd crew are all Chileans. During tho
Latona's stay in port the crew had given
tiie captain considerable troubie. and to
insure their services lor the voyage to
\ alparaiso he had them all conlined as
prisoners on board the vessel until he was
ready to put to sea. Under these condi
tions the Latona cleared from Pert
Blakeley. and twenty-eight days later we
sighted the vessel aoout 1:5 miles
oil San Francisco, headed due east.
"The Latona at that time was clearly
out of her course, and she ehould have
been at least ".'.< miles out to tea to catch
the trade winds. 1 sailed the Azalea
Â¦within fifty feet of the foreigner In order
to hail the captain and ascertain. If pos-
Elbie, why his vessel was so far out of
her course. It is always customary for
cm officer to be en deck at sea, but only
the sailors were in eight, and they did
not seem to know their course at all. To
the hall from the Azalea they gave no re
sponse, but continued to sail eastward.
"Failing to hear from the captain or
first mate, I am almost positive that
something hus occurred eince the ship left
port, cr.d I would not be surprised if it
were mutiny or murder. The Bailors were
all dissatisiied because of having: been
compelled to chip on the vessel. I believe
they took advantage of the captain when
the vessel wns out at eea. The captain of
the I^atona had h!s wife with him, and as
I saw no sign of her it is probable that
Bhe. too, has fallen a victim to the crew.
It was plainly to be seen that the men in
charge of the vessel were unable to shape
her course or to properly navigate It. The
v.-lnd at the time me sighted the Latona
was a fair cr.e for the vessel to keep her
en a southward course."

of Martin Will To-Day Com
mence Their Argument.
STOCKTON. Nov. 20.â The taking of
testimony in the Williams murder trial
wae concluded to-day, and arguments will
be begun in the morning. The testimony
offered by the State in rebuttal was not
extensive, but some of It went to very
Ball'ent pionts. William Dolan. the South
ern Pacific conductor who, \\ ..Hams said
yesterday, possibly was present at the
mooting between himself and Martin on
the Oakland ferry-boat, testified that he
was not present at' that meeting. Dr. F.
Burton testilied that he attended James
Sporry, who. Witness Sllnkey testified
yesterday, was pre.Â«ont at the meeting be
tween Martin and Williams in San Fran
cisco in September, Ociober or November
of 1S96, when Martin drew a revolver on
Williams and threatened to shoot, during
the latter'B last illness, and that James

STOW'S PARENTS OBJECT
AND HE STEPS Â» OUT
Big Freshman Known as the "Human
Plow" Will Not Be in Berkeley
Eleven.
BERKELEY, Nov. 20.â Sam Stow, the
big freshman who has been playing
right guard on the "varsity" eleven, has
been compelled to abandon the game be
cause of the Insistent objections from his
parents. Stow's loss is a serious one. He
would undoubtedly have been in the line
on the big eleven because he ranks as one
of tho best guards that ever played with
the blue and gold. Weighing 180 pounds
and coming from Belmont with the sobri
quet "The Human Plow," Stow was ex
pected to be one of the shining stars In
the intercollegiate game; but parental
protests could not be overcome, and ho
has stepped out.
Orval Overall, who has been trying for
fullback, is a candidate with Larry
O'Toolo for Stow's place in the line. It Is
likely Overall will make right guard, but
he is a better man at fullback. Duden
will probably win a place back of the line
as matters stand now. This afternoon Al

FIRE was discovered in tho base
ment of the northern end of tho
grand stand at Tanforan Park
shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday
. morning and only through heroic
efforts was the big structure saved from
destruction.
The fire started underneath the restau
rant, where some old lumber was stored.
Track Superintendent Cushing was coon
on the scene and ordered closed all aper
tures, thus shutting off any draught that
might fan thÂ© flames. ThÂ« Redwood City
fire department responded to a call for
assistance, and arriving on a special train
gave valuable aid. An opening was
chopped in the floor just in front of the
restaurant entrance and two streams of
water were kept playing steadily on the
flames. Not until 7 o'clock was the fire
finally subdued.
Although the damage was not serious,
many of the big timbers supporting the
betting ring will have to bo replaced.
The origin of tho fire Is a mystery. It
is learned on reliable authority that
flames were seen Issuing from four differ
ent places and incendiarism is strongly
euspected. The whole matter vrill.be rig
idly investigated.
Pouring rain and a track that was a
perfect sea of mud seriously detracted
from the sport yesterday. The crowd
seemed to possess a good line on the mud
larks and administered another severe
walloping to the bookmakers. Four heav
ily backed favorites, a second and a third
choice, each well supported, contributed,
to l v e depletion of the. ring's exchequer.
Pknn, a Strathmore horse from P.
Ryan's stable and a 7 to 5 choice, took
the first event, a short sprint, in clever
fashion. Ting-a-Ling put up a stiff argu
ment to within a sixteenth from the wfre,
where he flattened out, iastinj? long
enough, however, to beat Eight Dollara
for the place.
Such a good thing was Bab, a filly
sporting the Schorr colors, one of six
starters in the two-year-old scramble,
that tho smart ones were willing, to ac
cept any sort of a short price. She closed
a 1 to 2 chance, and in a rattling drive
Ktley on David S outfinished J. Miller
astride the favorite, getting the verdici
by a nose. Miller was severely criticized,
as the close observers thought only care
lessness lost the race.
Louis Ezell's mare, The Lady, came in
for big backing to win the mile- purse run.
She seemed to like the going and under
Kiley's excellent handling defeated Gnn
falon with something in reserve. Greeii
ock came out sore after hia run in the
Opening handicap, appearing unable to
raise a gallop.
No liberties were taken with Hermoso
by the books and at odds of 1- to 20 the
big chestnut won the next number as he
pleased. MaoLaren, a 60 to 1 shot, chased
the winner to the stretch, finally losing
the place to Horton, the second choice.
Owing to an injured hoof Autumn was
excused from being a starter In the mile
and a sixteenth run and a tremendous
plungo was made on The Fretter. From
twos the colt's price was forced down to
4 to 5 and he simply smothered Rio Chico
and Acrobat. This was one of tha se
verest blows dealt the ring.
Miller redeemed himself partly by cap
turing the last race of the day with Dan
gerfield. The Schorr colt had speed to
burn, and, catching the leg-weary Sad
Sam as the wire was approached, won
driving by less than a length. Screen wel!
Lake, the favorite, finished fourth.

SAX BERNARDINO, Nov. 20.â At West

j ly after dark last night, a vigilance com
j inn tee numbering twenty-five men went
to the ranch house of W. F. Carpenter
i and demanded of five Japanese, laborers,

They were placed aboard the cars and

FIIOEXIX, Ariz., Nov. 20.â Governor
Murphy to-day commuted the sentence of
John Echols, who has served three of his
ten years* sentence, to four years. Echols
will soon walk forth from the penitenti
ary. His imprisonment was the result of
a conviction for stage robbery, and the
commutation Is prompted by .the startling
confession of King Uesery, a noted crimi
nal, who says he, was "the guilty person,
and adroitly arranged his plans bo that
suspicion fell on Echols. , /
About three years ago a, stage running
between Prescott and the Crown King
mine was held up by a lone robber. in the
mountains near Gladiator Mill. Tho high
wayman relieved three passengers of $500
and made away with the mail pouch. The
robber was masked, carried a rifle and
wore hob-nailed shoes, so that his trail
was followed by a posse without difficul
ty. It led over tho mountains to the cabin
of Echols,.
On the trail was found a mailpouch
which had been looted and pieces ol cloth
which evidently had formed part of a
mask. The pursuing party followed the
trail to the cabin, where it found Echols.
In a room were found the hobnailed
shoes, the rifle and another piece of the
cloth. Echols protested his innocence,
but was taken to Prescott for trial, and
the circumstantial evidence appeared so
conclusive that he was convicted. On.
account of his bad record in Colorado,
where, it is said, he killed a man, his
sentence was ten years.
While Kchols lay In jail in Prescott
Ussery was captured after an exciting
chase and also Jailed there on a charge
of stealing horses from John Cline in
Tonto Basin. He employed Thomas Flan
nigan of Phoenix to defend him.
"I will pay you also to defend Echols,"
he once said to Flannigan. "I don't know
the man, but am convinced of his inno
cence."
lichols was pent to the penitentiary,
but Ussery was acQuitted and. within a
year was arrested again for "cattle rust
ling." He escaped jail at Globe, but was
recapture and when ; he saw the peni
tentiary i staring him in the face he wrote
to his attorney, confessing his guilt in the
Gladiator mine hold-up and exonerating
Kchols, who, he said, knew nothing about
it. This confession was confided only lo
his attorney, but after a year's Imprison
ment at Yuma, Ussery made a compre
hensive affidavit, which was submitted to
the Governor. ',:Â¦:Â¦ - .
Governor Murphy has been investigat
ing the case since that time and was
prompted to issue a pardon, .but he
learned that Ussery, while in the Crown
King Mountains, had mane his headquar
ters at Echols' claim and he believed th<3
latter knew something of tho stage hold
up. Echols' credits will shorten his. Im
prisonment to several months. -./...

MATCHMAKER BUMMERLAD
of the Golflpn Gate Athletic
Club wr.uld not take a prize for
being the most brilliant match
maker !n the world. That he
lacks a discriminating eye in the choice
of amateur was apparent last
night at the monthly boxing exhibition of
his club.
Out of eight bouts presented to a small
gathering of calloused fight goers, he pre
ef-nted one bout that was worthy of being
called such. This was the five-round con
test between JÂ«>e Sullivan and Dick Mar
tin. The judges declared Sullivan the
winner, but the decision did not meet with
the approval of the majority of the house.
Hoots and jeers greeted the awarding of
The medal to Suilivan. The flpht ehouhl
have been declared a draw, as both lads
were on their feet fighting fast and fu-
riouÂ«ly. It was bo even up to the fourth
that an oxtra round was called, and it
was evident to everybody that Alartin. al
though pomirwhat tired, was returning
blow for blow.
"Kid" Chinner gained a decision over
"Kid" Finnerty, alias Abie Cantor. The
latter fought the previous evening before
a rival club and won out. but he was not
so fortunate in his second fifrht. Abie did
all the leading for three rounds, but in his
anxiety to make connections he toppled
all ovor himself. Chinner had a majority
of friends in the house, and their yelling
influenced the judges somewhit in his fa
vor.
Jack Welch, a lanky youth built on the
style of a mosquito, had a left that was a
veritable sting. He shot it out so often
that he made George O'Hrien quit in one
round. Jack Murray entered the ring with
a dark "lamp," and after a few minutes
of heavy fighting with Tommy Bell his
other went into eclipse. Bell becamo
weary from jabbing Murray and might
have succumbed to a good punch, but
Murrav was too eager. In the .third round
Hell crossed Murray with a pretty right
and Murray rubbed his bloody proboscis
on the canvas. He was unable to rise,
and Hell was declared the victor.
Louis Burns, a small boy who ought to
have been in a kindergarten, tried con
clusions with a stocky youth named Kane,
and he made a sorry figure if. the ring.
He lasted a round and a-'ialf. "Dusty"
Roads made short work of Dan Fitzger
ald, alias Reagan. The latter stayed with
the Bame but two rounds. "Sailor Shar
key" was to have met Charles Prieste, but
the latter failed to materialize. Jack
Niles was substituted. Niles was nervous
when he entered the ring, but he became
positively frightened when he saw a tat
tooed knife on the sailor's mighty right.
He feared he was going to be scalped and
he saved his hair by dropping on a soft
spot in the second round.
Timeâ 3-18 :19H; 7-16, :43%; 9-16. :E6H; 6&f. 1:23. Fair start. Won easily. Second and third

Leading politicians did not fall to ob
serve that United States Senators Bard
and Perkins made the recommendation to
fill the vacancy in the office of Collector
of Customs without consulting the wishes
of other members of the California Con
gressional delegation. - Representative
Loud evidently anticipated that the Sen
ators had resolved to control the Federal
appointments, as he did not express great
surprise when he ascertained that a rec
ommendation for the Collectorship, had
been made without his knowledge.
Representative Kahn was taken by sur
prise. When he learned that F. S. Strat
ton had been recommended he was indig
nant. On the quiet Representative Met
calf s views may have been solicited. Per
haps, on the assuranco that one of the
Alameda aspirants would get the offlco
anyway, ho did not further concern him
self. .Representative Needham's Seventh
District is long, and in places wide. Hence
he had affairs of his own territory to com
mand his attention.
It is a well-grounded belief that the
California Senators in Congress have re
solved to adhere to the plan of exclusive
conferences In dealing with the future dis
tribution of Federal patronage In Califor
nia. This custom of giving to the Sen
ators the exclusive power of recommenda
tion for appointments is well established
in many of the leading Eastern Congres
sional delegations, but it has not been
6trictly honored .by California Congress
men. For ten years prior to the election
of Thomas R. Bard this State had only
one Republican in the Senate. Now there
are two Republican Senators from thi3
commonwealth and the administration Is
Republican. The conditions, therefore,
are favorable for Senatorial control or
the Federal patronage.
When Stephen M. White, a Democrat,
was the colleague of Senator Perkins, the
latter was often compelled to seek the
support of Republican members of the
House in order to carry out his plans. It
is doubtful If Senator Perkins could have
secured the appointment of Colonel J. 1*.
Jackson to the office of Collector of Cus
toms without the assistance of Republi
can Representatives in Congress. Joseph
S. Spear Jr. had strong indorsements â so
Influential was his support that the Sen
ator had a long and hard battle to obtain
the office for Colonel Jackson.
Senators Bard and Perkins have had
many close heart-to-heart talks during
the last three months. The subject of
Federal patronage in California was fully
discussed at their secret conferences In
Orange County. It appears to be under
stood that Senator Bard will name the
successor of John C. Lynch, Collector of
Internal Revenue, and Frank L. Coombs,
United States District Attorney. Lynch' s
appointment to a lucrative Federal offlco
caused some astonishment In California,
but his early retirement will produce
neither surprise nor regret.
Senator Perkins will attend the confer
ence of the Valley Development Associa
tion at Sacramento next Saturday. Sen
ator Bard has been obllg/ed - to Eend his
regrets to the Sacramento coir.mittee, as
existing engagements will not allow him
to attend the meeting.
Representative Loud haa made arrange
ments to leave San Francisco to-day for
"Washington. He suspects that the Sen
ators have resolved to dispose of the Fed
eral patronage In their own way.
Represents ti vi? Julius Kahn expects to
leave San Francisco for Washington next
Sunday.

Boston Young "Woman Demands
Cleve Dam, the attorney for the car
penters' union, testified that Wllber had
at his request made an affidavit, which
was produced in court, that he had
handed the money to Conroy in Burns'
office, but that his commission was 5 per
cent.
After the arguments of ex-Judge Low
for the defendant and Assistant District
Attorney Whiting the Judge charged the
jury and it retired. After being out for
about half an hour the jury came Into
court and the foreman said, "If we be-
K. D. Wllber was charged with petty
larceny on the complaint of James
\Voods, a carpenter, ana demanded a jury
trial. Woous was one of the men who
paid Wllber money on the promise that
ne would secure a position for him on
the front as a carpenter. The statement
made by Wllber to Woods was that the
money would be handed to a third party.
Woods, on being "examined, testified that
he gave Wilber $15 and received a receipt
for the money. He also gave him two
promissory notes lor ?25 each. Wilber
was to get a position for him on the water
front. Wilber told him that a large num
ber of men were to be paid ott on tne
lront, so. that It would be easy for him to
get a place. Wilber said he had to pay
the money to a third party. Witness
never got the position.
Conroy testified that he never had any
conversation with Wilber in his life. The
man was personally unknown to him and
he had never seen him In Dan Burns'
office. Leon Dennery testified that he was
a frequent visitor at Dan Burns' office
and he had never seen Wilber there, and
similar evidence was given by Burns' pri
vate secretary and others.
Wilber swore positively that he handed
the money to Conroy in Dan Burns' of
fice in the Crocker building. His arrange
ment with Conroy was that he was to be
allowed 10 per â¢ cent commission on all
money received for bartering positions on
the water front.
A jury In Judge Fritz's court yesterday
afternoon showed unmistakably by their
verdict that they believed Eddie Conroy,
bodyguard and factotum of Dan Burns,
was bartering positions on the water
front for money, thereby substantially
confirming the story puolishea by 'i'hu
Call some months ago.
Chief Justice Beatty and William
Thomas have received an invitation to
attend a banquet and conference in Sac
ramento next Saturday afternoon as rep
resentatives of this city. The affair is
planned by the Sacramento Valley Devel
opment Association. Governor Gage,
United States Senators Perkins and Bard.
Congressmen Coombs, Woods, Metcalf,
Kahn, Loud, McLachlan and Needham
are In the list of the invited guests. Oth
ers are State Senators Maggard, Cutter,
Goad, Luchsinger and Devlin and As
semblymen Gans, Collins, Schilllg, Sheri
dan, Chiles, Anderson, Johnson, Reeber
and Greer and Frank D. Ryan, Commis
sioner of Public Works. The purpose of
the gathering as defined is to enable
those present to appreciate how earnestly
and unselfishly the people of the Sacra
mento Valley are seeking to improve the
great natural resources of the country.
"We have no request to make at this
meeting," so reads the letter. "Our ex
ecutive committee will be present as the
sole representative of the Sacramento Val
ley Development Association. At a joint
session of the Sacramento Vailey and San
Joaquin Vailey associations to be held In
Sacramento in January some resolutions
may be formulated and sent to Congress
and to the Legislature, and we believe
that they will receive your support."
In other words, the conference is to talk
over the legislative needs " of the great
interior valleys and of the State at large
as the matter Is understood here. Chief
Justice Beatty and William Thomas will
attend as representatives of the Califor
nia Water and Forest Association. Irri
gation, and the reclamation of arid lands
are likely to figure as topics for discus
sion, together with the legislation that is
considered to be necessary for the public
good. This will be one of the most nota
ble conferences on public topics that has
been held in California.
Theme for Meeting of Sacra
mento Valley Develop
ment Association.
LEGISLATIVE
NEEDS OF STATE
Resolved. That copies hereof be sent to the
President of the United States and to the Cali
fornia delegation In Congress.
Resolved, That it is our belief that President
McKinley and his administration could build
at more enduring monument to hie own states
manship and the sagacity and foresight of the
Government of the United States than by
uigiQK and consummating the construction of
thin waterway; and, be it further
Resolved. That the board of directors of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
heartily reaffirm its b'lief In the general good
to be derived by the construction of this canal,
and more especially its benefits to California,
by giving greatly augmented facilities for
marketing thÂ« products of the State, lower
fppiBht tariffs to foreign countries, new mar
kets, and last, but not least, a medium by
which desirable European emigrants may come
to this St.-ite and help to increase its popula
tion, enlarge the consuming power of our home
markets, and thus contribute to the general
welfare of the Rtate: and. be It further
Whereas. We beljeve that a necessary adjunct
to the complete development of the commerce
of the United States with eastern countries,
and of our Atlantic seaboard with the Pacific
Coast, and with California in particular, is the
construction and completion of the Nicaragua
canal; therefore, be It
Whereas, The events of the paBt two years
bare emphasized in an extraordinary degree
the Importance of the Pacific Ocean as a water
way lor the commerce of the United States
with Oriental countries; and
Mr. Bancroft was instructed to be pre
pared to take prompt action looking to
the protection of California's Interests in
the adoption of the new Philippine tariff
and likewise to commence a campaign
having for its object the correction of the
present practice of the exporters of the
East and Middle West in continuing to
quote export pricÂ«s to dealers in Hawaii.
By a continuance of this practice, advan
tage has been taken in a number of . in
stances to import from the East to San
Francisco via the Hawaiian Islands at
prices less than could be obtained by San
FrandfÂ»co dealers with direct shipment.
The following resolution pertaining to
the Nicaragua canal was adopted.
Mr. Bancroft is well known among bus
iness men of this city and has their high
est esteem. For many years he was in
the employ of the old A. L. Bancroft Com
pany. Previous to his appointment to his
new office he was engaged in the publish
ing and school furnishing business. It is
his intention to take up his new work with
vigor and he will do his utmost to educate
the people in the sense of using home
products.
Charles E. Bancroft was unanimously
elected secretary and manager of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion at a meeting of the board of directors
of that organization yesterday. He suc
ceeds Eugene Goodwin, who was lately
appointed executive officer of the Pacillc
Commercial Muteum and who leaves for
Philadelphia shortly on business pertain
ing to that organization.

ducers' Association Has

I Â¦ Near Powell. . Open Evenlnss.RED BLUFF SENTINELâ It Is high
time for our people to shake off the old
inertia and move energetically along the
lines of progress. They have here .a
lovely country and one of the finest cli
mates in the world, but the land is gen
erally put to no better or more profltabla
uses than those of -which the plains of
bleak Siberia are capable, where wheat is
now grown to the extent of millions ol
tons. Tho Sacramento Valley, under in
cessant wheat culture, is stagnating, and
some parts of it have actually gone back
ward through decrease of population due
to the continuance of old ranch methoda.
There must be more small farming, dairy,
irrigation, beet-sugar production, bee
keeping, poultry raising, horticulture and
other rural industries of a varied nature,
if the country is to make any progress.
rally seeks after practical knowledge than
to take a large rental from tenants who
skin the place and hunt a new one when
the owner objects.
SOLANO REPUBLICANâ The changes
which have recently been made In tha
Australian ballot law in this State seem
to have been good ones and to have
worked with perfect satisfaction at tha
election Just passed. The new method
of registration worked well and there was
no inconvenience or trouble caused by
there being no great register. The sep
aration of the names of the candidates In
to party columns also seems to have been
a good thing and a great accommodation
to the voters, enabling them to prepare
their ballots in less time than it took
formerly. It also facilitated the counting
of the votes.
S0LAN0 COURIERâ The "paramount"
subject for discussion at the forthcoming
State Fruitjvowers' Convention will be
transportation. During the past season
the freight service was inadequate and
the results are too well known to need
recapitulation. The same subject has
been brought forward at previous con
ventions, but no practical results have
emanated therefrom. At the forthcoming
convention care should be taken in select
ing a committee of energetic and deter
mined menâ men who will act in the in
terests of the growers and who will fight
for an expedited freight service.
NILES HERALDâ Now that the election
Is over and people are settled down to
business, everyone should take a hand
to advance their local communities. The
time is good for improvements, and ail
that helps to put a town in trim will at
tract the stranger. When a movement to
build Is advanced encourage it, and don't
under any circumstances run down your
own community.
UJCIAH DISPATCH-DEMOCRAT.â This
election Is settled, right or wrong, and
it Is now the duty of all to do 'everything
in our power to make the next four years
as * happy, peaceful and prosperous as
possible. Support the President In all
that is right. If he is not right, try to
place him right. Be patriots, not parti
sans. Be one great family of true, loyal
American citizens until the ljext election.
STOCKTON MAILâ A Belgian haro

revision of the laws governing the Pro

The special committee appointed by the

ons which forbid rectors from performing
the ceremony of marriage when either of
the contracting parties has been divorced,
and also excommunicates Episcopalians
who have been divorced and remarry,
"except when the person so remarrying is
the innocent party to a divorce secured on
the ground of adultery."
ATLANTA CONSTITUTION'â The peo
ple of the South are part of the people of
the United States, with certain rights
which they propose to exercise regard
less of who wins in an election, and this,
too. without stopping to argue whether
they choose to entertain the one political
opinion or the other. They are not in need
of the patronizing sufficiency of a few
men who think they know it all. In the
meantime the cotton mill is going up all
over the South, and if there are any Phil
adelphia capitalists who want to invest
they will find better concerns in Georgia
than in Pennsylvania.
NEW YORK SUNâ In the war. with
Spain we had not a single boat to spare.
The country was in a condition of pro
found peace when the New York, the Ore
gon and all the other vessels of which we
are so proud were built, and it was al
ways something of a struggle to secure
the authorization of new ships. Every
addition to our navy adds not only to our
ability to care for our vast Interests as a
nation but directly makes for peace in the
councils of the world. It is undeniable
that it is largely through the efficiency of
our navy that we shine as a world power.
NEW YORK POST-To an American
one of the striking things in France 13
the way that everybody buys flowers. No
matter how poor the owner, every market
garden must have its little nosegay. With
us flowers are rather the luxury of the
rich. In few of our great cities do cheap
and abundant flowers add, as in Washing
ton, to the attractiveness of the market*..
It is strange that florists have so grn^r
ally neglected the possibiltfes of flowers
for the multitude. If it pays to print yel
low Journals, why not to pick yellow dais
ies, which grow wild almost at our door?
RICHMOND TIMESâ Talk about a re
united country, talk about the oblitera
tion of sectional prejudice, there is on<Â»
great obstacle in the wayâ the same that
caused friction between the two sections
and brought the war, even the negro prob
lem. The negro was a marplot first as a
slave and later as a voter. The slavery
question, thank God, has been settled and
retired. If now we can get rid of negro
suffrage the same Influence which control
politics in other sections will control in
the South, and the South will no longer
necessarily be solid for any party.
PHILADELPHIA NORTH AMERICAN
âThe time has not yet come, though it is
probably not far distant, when the Gov
ernment will see the wisdom of doing
something to save much of the water that
. now goes to waste in the States of the
Rocky Mountain region. Irrigation has
long since passed beyond the experimental
stage. It has even reached the point
where little more can be profitably done
by private capital. Yet vast areas of the
public domain remain unreclaimed In lo
calities where land would have a high
value if an artificial water supply were
assured the year round.
'PITTSBURG DISPATCHâ The total im
ports for the year will not fall much be
low $S50,000.000, while tha total of exports
will go well up toward a billion and a half
of dollars. These figures are tremendous
when compared with the statistics even
of ten years ago. and tell the story why
Great Britain and Germany are worried
about their own commercial welfare. The
excess of exports over Imports to the end
of October was $499,667,936â a tidy sum to
the credit of the country abroad or to be
paid in the gold that Europe is seeking in
vain.
NEW YORK TRIBrNEâ The Filipinos
are a bright people, with some Japanese
traits. If their youth sent here to learn
should show the Japanese adaptability
and receptivity they might transform tho
Philippine Islands, and make them a cen
ter of Western civilization. At any ratf,
the training of Filipinos here would give
us a body of intelligent natives in sym
pathy with American life, who would be
most useful as assistants In our adminis
tration there and as Jeaders of ttreir own
people.
CHICAGO INTER OCEANâ To Ameri

tion of its territorial and political entity,
for Europe has agreed to these. Straight

China, but probably a general Kuropean
war. At the same time it has preserve.!

gacity of the American course is noTV ad

MILWAUKEE "WISCONSINâ If tho

Chicago drainage canal trustees and the
shipment of material to Europe by tho
St. Lawrence River route should incrf>a^<s
in volume, the ports of the Great Lak?a

raw material, fuel and transportation fa

PHILADELPHIA TIMESâ After all tho

the restoration of peace and productive

England has no compensation yet in

Judge Morrow has defined the meaning of "more

differs from the experience of most of us that the
meaning is 'Ics*."
It has been argued in one of our courts that local
civil service is superlatively absurd because it places
San Francisco gm-ernmentally out of California. The

consistent in looking upon the city as a private reser
vation of their own. "
Chief of Police Sullivan intends to cripple Chinese

The rains are not sufficient to assure the field crops

z'""* ALIF0RNIA fiuit-growers are to hold their
I annual convention in this city beginning De-
cember 4 and continuing for four days. It is
expected the gathering will be the largest that has
ever yet assembled, and many issues of high impor
tance, not to the fruit men only but to the whole
State, are to be discussed.
The convention is to be held under the patronage
of the State Board of Horticulture, and a cordial in
vitation has been extended to all fruit-growers and
others interested in horticulture and kindred pursuit*
to be present and take part in the proceedings. It is
of course desirable that every branch of the fruit in
dustry be represented, for the problems to be dis
cussed concern them all.
A circular issued by the State Board of Horticul
ture outlines some of the more important issues af
fecting the fruit industry at this time by announcing:
"California fruit-growers demand an improved ex
pedited freight service for Eastern fruit shipments.
Unity of action upon the part of the growers is much
desired. In order- to prevent the introduction of the
dreaded Morelos orange maggot into California the
citrus-growers demand that all cars carrying said
fruit East be disinfected by live steam before entering
the State." It is also announced that at the conven
tion the California Cured Fruit Association, the
Citrus Fruit Exchange, the State Raisin Association
and other similar bodies will make reports of the sea
son's operation which will be of special interest.
For the purpose of encouraging attendance at the
convention it is announced that the Southern Pacific
Company and the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway Company will issue excursion tickets
to all persons going, to the convention and returning
at reduced rates from all points on their lines to San-
Francisco, provided a receipt for the tickets purchased
be taken at starting point. This will be counter
signed by, the secretary and will entitle the holder to
a return ticket at one-third the regular rate.
THE STATE FRUIT GROWERS.
offense against fair politics and the dignity of high
position. It is a distinct menace to the welfare of tht
country to which Sir Charles owes his highest pa
triotic duty. Nothing that Sir Wilfrid Laurier or
any of his more reckless supporters in Quebec may
have said could amount to a more potent appeal to
racial and religious prejudices than this speech of
Sir Charles. The evil effects of it are certain to be
long lasting and deeply pernicious to the politics of
the country.
The offense was the more grave because the speaker
was compelled to resort to something like an absurd
ity when trying to find specific illustrations of French
rule in Canada. Thus he is quoted as having, said:
"French Canadians are all-powerful at Ottawa, and
none but a Frenchman can obtain an appointment or
secure a contract for any public work in or out of
Quebec. Even in the old British Columbian town of
New Westminster, the people entirely being English
or Scotch, a French-Canadian from Quebec was given
the contract for the new federal buildings now in
course of construction there; every stonemason,
every plasterer and every carpenter working on that
building is a French Canadian, brought 3000 miles
from Quebec to New Westminster to do work which
should be given to home mechanics, but the latter
possess the unpardonable offense of an English
tongue, and no favors need be expected by them."
When a man of the high position of Sir Charles
Tupper warns his fellow countrymen that the French
are about to rule over them, and then has to come
down to petty charges about contractors' jobs, he has
certainly outlived his usefulness. The Conservatives
stand?"
A speech of that kind is something worse than an
A SHORT time ago Sir Charles Tupper, who for
many years has been the leader of the Conser
vative party in Canada, announced an intention
to retire from politics. He stated at the time that he
would have retired before the recent election had not
his friends urged him to continue at the head of the
party until after the campaign. He declared a feeling
of gratification in the fact that he was defeated for
re-election, inasmuch as it made his retirement easy,
and added he would not accept a seat in Parliament
if one were offered him without a contest.
All of that was very fine, and it appeared the "old
man eloquent of Canada," as he has been called by his
aÂ«lmirers, was about to retire with dignity and grace.
The appearance, however, was deceitful. The old
man has been nursing a grievance, and has not been
;ble to keep it concealed from the public. He holds
the belief that his rival, the leader of the Liberals, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, owes his success to the fact that he
â¢s of the French race and the Catholic religion, and
he has at last said so in a public speech which his
fr-ends will long have reason to deplore.
He is reported to have said that Laurier carried
Quebec by appealing "to the base passions of his ig
norant French Canadian compatriots," that he "is
breeding bitterness and unhappiness and strife," and,
in what is described as a voice of passion, he added:
"French Canadians rule Canada to-day. Men of
British blood, how much more are you going to
RACE PREJUDICE IN CANADA.
Lord Rosebery has puzzled Englishmen, the dis
patches announce, by a speech in which he mingled
common sense, sentiment and rhetoric. And it is safe
to say that there is not an Englishman alive who
would not be mortally offended if one were to pick
out the puzzling element of the speech. . \
An English skipper has reached port with the
startling information that he has discovered an island
of the South Pacific twenty-three miles out of place
on the map. He ought to congratulate himself that,
after the stir of the last two years, some of them wera
not oft the map altogether.
The new^ine will be one of the fine?t scenic routes
ii; America and will help to attract travel to the State.
It will open up a rich region of territory and pro
mote the development of the varied resources of the
coast. A picturesque and fertile section of the State
v.hich has been so long sidetracked will now be along
one of the main lines of travel and traffic, and the
benefits resulting are sure to be felt throughout Cali
fornia.
The road across the old gap is said to be an excel
lent one in even- respect. Our reports say: "The
entire old line between Hllwood and Santa Barbara is
being removed. Work has begun to straighten the
line between Ventura znd Santa Barbara. The old
it on is being replaced throughout with standard moun
tain Bteel. Curves arc being eliminated for fast time.
A KjÂ£ force is at work at either end of the, Santa
Sus.ina tunnel and along the Chatsworth Park line.
This will shorten the tintancc to Los Angeles, cutting
out heavy grades through a hot section, and places
the Oxnard district on the main line."
The completion of the gap has been long waited
for. More than ten ytars have elapsed since the
Southern Pacific manapers of that time promised that
if right of way w ere given the construction of the road
would be energetically and continuously prosecuted.
Many times since the promise was made the people
v.ho contributed to the right of way have been almost
iV despair. To their disappointed hopes it seemed -as
il the road would never be completed. All those fears
are now allayed. The completion of the work is at
hand. The Thanksgiving season will be propitious to
that festival which the coast people long ago decided
to hold as soon as the road was finished.
Should these reports prove true it will be a glad
Tlunksgivir.g day for all the counties along the coast
from San Francisco to Los Angeles, and, indeed, to
the whole State. Had the change in the qverland
route taken place before the construction of the Val
ley road and its union with the Santa Fe system the
result might have been prejudicial to the interests of
the San Joaquin. but now that great valley has the ad
vantage of competing tmnscontincntal routes and will
lose nothing by the gain which comes to the coast
counties. Thus the termination cf that enterprise is
one in which ail sections of California have reason for
gratification. It is another step forward in the ad
vancement of the commonwealth and prepares the way
for the next step, which ought to be the construction
of a railway alor.g the coast from San Francisco
northward so as to bring the rich territory of that re
gion in direct and speedy communication with the
metropolis.
T~\ ISPATCHES from Santa Barbara announce
I ) that the construction force on the "gap*' of the
" â coast road is at work on the last big viaduct
a: Gaviota; that it ha? been reported on gbod author
ity a locomotive will pass over the track closing the
g::p about Thank?giving, and, finally, that when th?
line is completed the overland traffic of the Southern
Pacific will go by that route.
COMPLETING THE CO0ST ROfJD.
The late dispatches from Washington give encour
agement that the wish will be gratified. The report
of the commission may not show such divergencies of
opinion as were feared; and with the earnest support
of the administration given to a definite line of policy
we may see the long debate ended this winter and the
big canal undertaken Â¦\yithin a year.
The country desires an isthmian canal. The great
mass of the people are not advocates of any particular
'route. They wish only that the work begin promptly
and be prosecuted with vigor. There would be a gen
eral gratification if the^coming year, the first of the
new century, should see the enterprise begun in ear
nest.
Hardly anything could be gained by a further post
ponement at this time. We have had commission
after commission to examine the routes, and all the
facts in connection with each of them so far as the
ablest experts could comprehend have been laid be
fore Congress. Differences of opinion exist as a mat
ter of course, but they will always exist, and therefore
it will be just as easy to settle the matter this winter
as next winter.
There is of course no desire to have the Govern
ment take "snap judgment" on a matter of this kind.
The construction of a canal by either route will vir
tually prevent the construction of the other. It is
therefore a matter of the highest importance that a
wise selection, be made in determining the route.
When full allowance is made for all considerations of
that kind, however, the fact will remain that it would
be foolish to stand forever hesitating between the two
routes and constructing no canal at all.
While the danger of such a controversy has not
wholly passed away, the gratifying report has been
given out in Washington that the commission will
report almost unanimously in favor of Nicaragua. ' It
was added in the dispatches of yesterday: "There is
no reason whatever for believing that the Panama
route will be recommended, and it is said on good
authority that President McKinley has been given
information as to the most practical route, which he
will use in his message. This, in line with the report,
will advocate the adoption of the Nicaragua route;
the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty; the
construction of the canal without fortifications and
the adoption of tolls discriminating in favor of the
United States, Costa Rica and Nicaragua only so far
as coastwise vessels are concerned, and leaving the
canal open to all the shipping of the world."
SOME days ago we directed attention to a de
velopment of a sentiment in the Eastern States
in favor of the Panama route over that of "Nica
ragua for the construction of the interoceanic canal.
Commissioner Schlect, who had just returned home
after an examination of the routes, was reported to
have intimated a preference for Panama, and the
same preference was expressed by several influential
papers. Upon that shewing we pointed out there was
likely to be a prolonged contest between the advo
cates of the rival routes, and that as a consequence a
danger exists of an indefinite postponement of the en
terprise.

The South Sea cannibals who gave one of their
weird dances on the water front the other day are said
to have excited considerable amusement. It is all in
the point of view; the effect of the dance would have
been very different if the spectators were being enter
tained at the home of the cannibals.
It is not necessary to go over the whole list. The
instances given show that even a reduction of. so small
an amount as that fixed upon can be made in a way
that will give no little satisfaction. There is nothing
gained by having a surplus revenue. The people have
need of all their money in the channels of trade, and
it can be much better employed in private business
than in the vaults of the treasury.
It is clear that in any revision of the law the tax on
express companies and telegraph companies should
be either so framed that the corporations cannot,
evade it, or else it should be abolished. It is folly to
maintain a tax that cannot be honestly enforced.
A more important issue is that of the taxes on ex
press and telegraph xeceipts. Those taxes are fair
enough in themselves, and could they be enforced as
Congress * intended, so that the corporations would
have to pay them, there would be no objection. In
operation, however, such taxes have had no ether
effect than that of promoting fraud on the part of
the corporations and discontent on the part of the
public. The Call has exposed the trick by which
Wells-Fargo sought to dodge the tax by offering to
take a whole wagon-load of papers as one package,
giving one receipt for it and thus cheating the Gov
ernment. The Call refused to be a party to the fraud,
but doubtless if has been extensively practiced, never
theless.
Although a reduction of $15,000,000 is not much in
'.tself, it can be made a considerable relief to the pub
lic by arranging to produce it by a repeal of those
tsxes which while yielding comparatively little rev
enue are either unjust or are harassing and annoying.
An unjust tax is that levied upon the native table
wines without respect to value. That tax falls al
most exclusively upon California, since in no other
part of the Union ire wines used at meals by the
general mass of people. We have evaded the tax
somewhat by serving wine in pitchers or in glasses,
but the evasion is not satisfactory. The revenue
raised in that way cannot amount to much, and the
tax should be repealed.
Appropriations for the current year aggregate $7Â°9r
729.476. For the coming: fiscal year estimates will
amount to $750,000,000 or more, including the expense
of the postal service. The principal reason given for
this increase instead of a possible reduction is that the
continuation of the war in the Philippines has made
it impossible to reduce the expenditures for a military
establishment. Estimates for this object will approxi
mate what they were last' year in round figures â $128,
000,000. An extensive ship-building programme
being carried out by the navy also requires increased
expenditures, and naval estimates for next year are
more than $28,700,000 larger than for the last year.
An estimate will also be submitted for about $25,000,
000 for river and harbor improvements.
Further reductions can hardly be expected from this
% Congress, partly because the session is going to be
too short to undertake a radical revision of the rev
enue laws in connection with the other business be
fore Congress, but mainly because there is likely to
be an increase of expenditure which will materially
reduce the surplus revenues, and no one knows ex
actly how much will remain.
WASHINGTON reports announce that Secre
tary Gage will probably recommend a reduc
tion of about $15,000,000 a year in the war rev
enues. The report is in harmony with statements re
cently made by Mr. Payne, chairman of the Ways and
Means Gommittee of the House, and is doubtless re
liable.

SANTA ROSA REPUBLICANâ It is not
pleasing to learn that a professor in Stan
ford University has lost his place because
of his utterances in regard to economic
questions. Professor Ross would be of
no value to the institution in which he has
labored if he were without decided con
victions concerning the subjects taught
by him. He is an original thinker and is
outspoken in the declaration of his views.
While we have not Infrequently differed
from him in his discussion of issues and
havo noted his change of attitude concern
ing economic questions, we have not
doubted his honesty or his ability.
FRESNO REPUBLICANâ It is well, in
deed, for Stanford University that the
enforced resignation of Professor Ross
was not made public ten days ago. bo
fore the people had voted on the amend
ment exempting the university from tax
ation, for there is no question that, in
that case, the amendment would have*
been overwhelmingly defeated. The only
possible excuse for exempting Stanford
University from taxation is the conten
tion that it is in everything but name a
public Institution. Nothing is a public
Institution whose essential policies are
subject to the whim of any private per
son whatever, and still less if that whim
is nothing but an old woman's crotchet.

It seems to bÂ© generally understood
amonff the local railroad men that F. H.
McGuigan will accompany Charles M.
Hays, the new president of the Southern
Facinc, when the latter comes here in
January to take up his new duties. It
was thought at first that McGuigan
would succeed Hays as general manager
of the Grand Trunk system, as he was
next in line for promotion and his name
had been recommended to the board ,of
directors by Hays, who was asked by
President Wilson to recommend a good
man for the vacancy. But the recent ap
pointment of George B. Reeve to that po-
Fltion opened up a ne\v avenue of specula
tion.
McGuigan is said to have considered
the matter carefully before declining to
accept the Kastern appointment. It is
thought he was Influenced by a better of
fer from Mr. Hays. Railroad men say it
is not likely that McGuigan would be con
tent to retain his present position as gen
eral superintendent Of the Grand Trunk
when he could have held the more im
portant and lucrative office of general
manager. It is taken for granted that
McGuigan will, in all probability, leave
the Grand Trunk at the same time that
Mr. Hays goes and that the two will
come to San Francisco together.
This theory is given emphasis bv the
recently published dispatch from Montreal
I that several officials who have been asso
i dated with Hays since he went to Canada
are to join him in this city. McGuigan
and Hays have been intimately associated
with each other in railroad work for the
past twelve or more years and Havs has
always shown a disposition to advance
the interests of McGuigan on every pos
sible occasion.
Just what office McGuigan would fill If
he came to the coast Is. of course, a mat.
' ter of speculation. There is no offic** of
jreneral superintendent at the present
time, but it is generally understood that

"I will do nothing." said Oodchaux, "un
til the case Is finally Bettled on appeal.
Judge Hebbard simply overruled the de
murrer put in by the Civil Service Com
mission. The commission has ten days
within which to answer, but. with the
expectancy of an unfavorable decision. It
will probably take the case to the Su
preme Court Instead. It Is quite likely
that after the final decision Is rendered I
will reappolnt some of my old staff as
vacancies occur."
"As I understand the matter, the suit
was brought by a taxpayer to prevent a
wasteful expenditure of the. city's money
and I might be enjoined from signing the
salary demands of the commissioners on
that ground. I have referred the point
to my attorneys, however, and I will abide
by their opinion."
Recorder Godchaux, who probably had
more civil service eligibles forced upon
him than any other city official, says
that he will not take any action with re
gard to his copyists as a result of Heb
bard'ei decision. A rumor was current
around the City H.iU that Oodchaux
would dismiss his copyists to make room
for some of those who were ousted when
civil service was put Into effect.
Auditor Wells is In some doubt whether
the salary demands of the Civil Service
Commissioners should be audited. He
has referred the matter to his legal ad
visers for an early opinion.
"The fact that the duties of the Civil
Service Commission have been seriously
curtailed by taking from its Jurisdiction
all the county offices will lea\-e but HtUo
for it to do, says Wells. "The decision
to my mind affects any office which does
busine.es with the State and to tne long
list of offices which were directly affecte.1
by the suit might be added the office of
the Auditor, Treasurer and even the Reg
lstrar. In that event the Civil Service
Board would be concerned only with the
Board of Public Works. Health Board and
the Police and Fire Departments; and this
would not require a great deal of their
time.
"I am in favor of holding the examina
tions scheduled even at the risk of being
cited for contempt of court." said Mc-
Carthy after the conference. "The fact
that I might spend a few days in jail
would not deter me from rising- to a de
fense of the civil service system to which
Judge Hebbard has dealt so serious a
blow. I consider Hebbard's decision as
an outrage in that it prevents the Civil
Service Commissioners- from performing
their legal duties. If I could bring my as
sociates to my way of thinking, we would
bring this matter to an issue by holding
the examinations, no matter at what cost
it might be to our personal liberty. It
fieems, though, that more peaceable meas
ures will be resorted *.o and a reversal of
Hebbard's decision by the Supreme Court
is t>ur only hope."
McCarthy strongly urged his colleagues
to hold the examinations scheduled for
the offices proscribed from civil service,
notwithstanding Judgd Hebbard's deci
sion, but Freud and Quinn would not
agree to this plan until the matter had
been referred to attorneys who had con
ducted the commission's side of the case.
The Civil Service Commissioners held a
secret conferenceyesterday afternoon with
Mayor Phelan in his private office for the
purpose of authorizing the course to be
pursued in the matter of Judge Hebbard's
decision overthrowing the merit system
in so far as it affects county offices. Com
missioners Freud, McCarthy and Quinn
were present at the conference and took
part -in an animated discussion whicn
lasted more than an hour. The only con
clusion arrived at was that an appeal
will be taken immediately to the Supreme
Court. This much was admitted by Freud
and Quinn when they came away from
the meeting. Neither of the commission
ers would say anything further.

"I had just left the Mail dock." Murphy
said, "and suggested to a friend that we
go and have a beer. We had just ordered
the drinks In Jerry Maloney's saloon,
â¢when a man whom I never saw before
came in with the officers and said. 'That's
the fellow,* and they arrested me. I do
not know why, but they said I had tried
to shoot somebody."
The crowd gradually dispersed and a lit
tle later in the evening Mrs. Albrecht
Â¦went to the door to take a glance at the
weather. The shots were fired upon the
appearance of the woman's head. Al
brecht went for the police and took them
to Maloney's saloon on Second street,
â¢where they arrested Murphy, -who was
identified by Mrs. Albrecht as the man
who did the shooting. He was locked up
and charged with assault to murder.
The noise attracted the attention of Al
brecht. who canto out, and told Murphy
that Campbell had no money. - Murphy
then became quarrelsome and was finally
thrown out by the proprietor.
It seems that early In the evening a
crowd was gathered in the saloon drink
ing, when Jerry Murphy entered and
joined in the festivities. Several rounds
of drinks were had. One of the men,
named Campbell, went out through the
rear door of the place and was followed
by Murphy, who asked for the loan of
eome money. Campbell told him he had
no money to loan, which did not suit Mur
phy, who started a loud argument.
Mrs. John P. Albrecht opened the door

The reader may ask. What Is this rea
sonable time within which an employer, if
promising to repair, is bound and beyond
which he Is not bound In any event? No
definite time can be fixed: each case
stands by Itself. In a case against the
Northern Pacific Railroad that was tried
In Minnesota an employe who served as a
blacksmith leave notice that his assist
ant was Incompetent and was promised
a better one. Relying on this promise, he
continued at his work, and four days
afterward was injured by his assistant.
The company contended that so loner a
period had passed since the time of mak
ing their promise and the accident that
their employe should have regarded their
promise as no longer binding, and the
risk therefore of working with the incom
petent- helper was his own. The court
rendered a verdict In favor of the em
ploye, which was sustained by the Court
of Review.
Another case Involving thta question
arose In Alabama. A miner was using a
fuÂ»e that did not Ignite readily. Six days
before the accident to be. described, the
master had been notified that the fuse
was bad, and he told the miner to do the
best he could with what he> had until he
could get other. The miner continued to
work, and six days after the master's
promise he charged a hole with dynamite,
lit the fuse and left the mine.- The ex.
plosion ought to have happened Iri two or
three minutes: the miner waited twenty
minutes and then returned. At that mo-
Again, suppose an employer makes a
promise to repair and forgets it. or breaks
ft, what then? This is an important ques
tion. The rule Is this: If an employe, re
lying upon it, continues at his post, he
can hold his employer for any liability
that may happen to him growing out of
the defect of which he had given notice,
within a reasonable time to remedy it If
the employe Is so inclined. If he does
not remove the defect within this period,
thte law regards him as having changed
his mind, and his promise to repair or
remove the defect is no longer binding.
If, therefore, the employe continues to
work beyond this period eriven by the law
to- the employer, to make his promise
good, he does so at his risk, as thouerh
the employer had never promised at all.
How Long Is the Promise Binding?
An employer on receiving such notice
often promises'to dismiss the Incompetent
servant, or repair the defective apparatus,
and by reason of this promls** the employe
continues to work. In such cases tho
courts all agree that he does not assumo
the new risk; the master assumes it. In
other words, he would quit work If his
master did not promise to make the de
fect good. The master does not wish him
to stop, and tells him to go on as befora
and he will cure the difficulty, whatever
it may be; and he, relying solely on this
promise, resumes hi3 task. Clearly In
such cases the master is liable for any
injury that may happen to him after that
from using the defective machine or appli
ance or continuing to labor with the in
competent servant. But if. when he no
tifies the master of his discovery, he say3
nothing, is an oyster, makes no promise
to do anything, he assumes no new lia
bility, and if his workman continues f>
labor as before he does so at his own
risk.
Effect of Not Keeping 1 the Promise.
Effect of Employer's Promise.
This is the law In most States. An em
ploye must notify his employer of the m
competency of a fellow-servant who U
working with him. of a defect that ha.*
happened in any appliance or machine h*
Is using. If he does not he Is regarded
as assuming the newly discovered risk.
Thus far all the courts enforce the same
rule. But if an employe gives notice o:
a defect or of the working of an Incom
petent servant by the side of him he still
assumes the risk If his employer does not
promise to remedy the defect and his em
ploye continues to work. The courts of
Illinois and many others say the same
thing, that an employer is negligent If
he does nothing to remedy the defect after
he has received notice of It; on the other
hand, the employe is also nosrliRent If he
remains at his post. The courts say that
he can quit and that it is his duty to do
so. This, however, is not the rule In all
the States, as we shall soon learh.
the Risk Himself.
In Wilder's case against the United
States Rolling Stock Company, which wae
tried by the courts of Illinois, he was in
jured by an incompetent engineer em
ployed by the same company. In setting
forth his duties the court said that he
was required to "keep his eyes open to
what was passing before him, and avail
himself of such information as he might
receive with respect to the habits and
â¢ways of his fellow-servants, and if, from
either of these sources of Information, he
found that one of them, from incompe
tency or other cause, rendered his owr.
position extra hazardous. It was his duty
to notify the master, and if the latter
refused to discharge the incompetent or
otherwise unfit fellow-servant the com
plaining servant would have no alterna
tive but to quit the master's employ. If
he does not, he will be deemed to have as
sumed the extra hazard of his position
thus occasioned. On the part of the mas
ter, it is negligence to retain the derelict
servant in his employ. It is, on the other
hand, negligence in the complaining ser
vant to continue longer in the master's
service unless he intends to assume the
extra risk himself."
If He Does Not Notify He Assumes
Wilder's Case.
On one occasion the rule was applied in
Alabama to the case of a miner. It is
everywhere admitted, says the court,
"that if the danger encounttred by the
employe through h!s continuance in the
service is so obvious and inevitable as
that no person of ordinary prudence
would venture upon It then the continu
ance ot the peril is a,t his own risk and
the employer is sccuitted of responsibil
ity upon che ground of the employe's con
tributory negligence. Where, however,
the employe or servant, electing not to
abandon his employment, gives notice to
the employer of such defect in the appli
ances or instrumentalities used by him.
and the employer promises to remedy the
defect, the relationship of the contracting
parties at once undergoes a change. The
assurances of the employer that the dan
ger shall be removed is an agreement by
him that he will assaime the risk Incident
to the danjrer for a reasonable time."
Such is the law In all the States.
The Case of a Miner.
Suppose he does give notice, what then?
Douotless many of our readers imagine
we will answer that the master becomes
p.t once the insurer against the new risk.
Nothing of the kind. If he promises to
repair, then he becomes the insurer: if
he keeps silent, in many States, though
not in all, the courts have paid that ne
does not assume any new liability. What
then is the condition of the employe?
Either he must assume the new risk or
quit. The master cannot compel him to
serve longer; he can quit if he pleases;
but if he chooses to remain he does so at
his own risk, unless his employer prom
ises to repair or remove the new defect
or risk, whatever it may be. The rule
has been repeated by the courts.
If a defect occurs in a machine or an in
competent employe Is found out and the
discoverer continues at his post and gives
no notice of his discovery and is after
ward injured through the defect, what
ever it may be, ho can recover nothing.
In such cases the courts say that the em
ploye assumes the new risk.
Consequences of Not Giving Notics.
ployers of Defects, Etc.
The law requires every employe to no
tify his employer of defects mat occur in
the appliances of machinery that he Is
using, or of incompentency in hla co
employes. This rule is based on the
lounde-u reason. The employer must
look to those who work for him far such
infcrmatlcn. The employer of. a great
factory could not by persona! Inspection
find out every defect; nor <jould persons
appointed toy him for that purpose. Of
course there is often inspection cf ma
chinery by persons who are hkllled in the
use of it, but besides such inspections the
law clearly throws on employes the duty
also ot notifying employers cl all defects
that happen while they are at work.

This, however, is not the law in all the
States. In some of them. Virginia, for
example, the courts hold that on the dis
covery of some great defect, the employ
ment of an incompetent servant or the
breaking" of a machine, if the employe
gives notice of it he has done enough, lie
ia not required to quit to escape the un
usual risk. If he chooses to remain, he
can do so and his master is responsible
for the consequences.

The Law in Virginia.
It may also be added that a clear differ
ence exists between the cases In which
an unusual risk Is discovered after an em
ploye has been to work and the cases in
which he knows of Its existence before,
undertaking employment. When he
knows of it at the outset, tho risk of in
jury from alt dangers known, or ought
to have been known by him. is wholly his
own. But after he has begun worn he
may discover a dancer the risk of which
he is unwilling to assume and from whlcn
he escapes by notifying hla master and
obtaining hla promise to remove it. On
the other hand, as we have seen, if the
master makes no promise to his employe
In response to the notice, and he works
on as before, the law regards him as as
suming the risk, as much so as though,
he had known it in the beginning.
Undertaking Employment
Again, when an employer has been no
tified of the incompetency of a servant,
or of some new delect in an appliance or
machine, he has a reasonable time to in
vestigate th<Â» charge or notice before act
ing, lie is not required on the complaint
by a workman of the Incompetence of an
other to dismiss him, or to make any
promise to dismiss him. or to assume any
more risk if he is kept until he has in
vestigated for himselt. 'ihia la the law.
The courts maintain that an employer
need not act until assured that the com
plaint or notice is true. If the law wero
otherwise, it is maintained, employers
wouW be put too much at the mercy of
their employes.
Risks Discovered Before and After
gate After Receiving Notice.
The Supreme Court of Indiana also re
marks that this rule dors not prevail in
all the States. "Some of the cases gn
further and assert that the promise of
the employer exonerates the employe en
tirely, ev^n though the continuance in
the service is known to him to be con
stantly and immediately dangerous."
An Employer Has Time to Investi-
The court of review considered another
principle that oujjiit to be clearly under
stood. If the delect or new danger ts a
very grave one. the employe ought to quic
at once, and if he bhould remain, relying
on his employer's promise to remove It,
the risk is nevertheless his own, and il
Injured he can look to no one for redress.
The rule has been thus stated by the Su
preme Court of Indiana. When a new dan
ger has been discovered, if it Is not great
and constant, and his employer promises
to remove it, he may rely on the promise.
but when the danger is great and lmmtiii
ate "and is of such a nature that a pru
dent man would not voluntarily Incur it."
a promise to remove it does not iusttfy
an employe in remaining at his post.
"When the line of danger, direct and cer
tain, is reached, there the citizen mus*
stop, and he cannot pass it. even upon
the faith of another's promise. If to pa3.a

was killed. The employer sought to
shield himself behind this rule of law that
the miner had remained at his work be

had promised to supply him with proper
fuse. He asked the court to charge th<*
jury that If they should conclude from
the evidence that the miner continued at
his work beyond a reasonable time after
the promise to furnish the fuse was given

the employer. The Judse refused to

CHICAGO. Nov. 20.â Wheat showed some in
dications of weakness around th* opening.
Liverpool was weak and lower and this fact,'
though expected after yesterday's decline here,
caused enough selling pressure on a market
almost bare of buyers, to send prloes down
slightly. Shortly after the opening the little
buying flurry sent the price upward in a hurry
December opened a shade lower at 70HQ7oT t o
and advanced to 7OHÂ©7O%c on this demand the
market for a short time having an oversold ap
pearance. The fact that primary receipts were
rather small had some Influence In this buying
A period of depression followed, during which
a new season's low record was made, Decem
ber declining to 70c. Bradstreet's report on the
visible showing an Increase of 1,800.000 bushels
started the liquidation and the weak spot was
taken advantage of by professional bears to
force out stop orders. But the reaction came
quickly after 70c had been reached. A local
demand, which grew quite heavy as the session
drew to a doee, absorbed all wheat offered and
from 70c the market roÂ«e steadily to 71%c
The close was firm at 70IiÂ©71c.
Corn wjs irregular, active at times, but with
many dun periods. The weather continued un
favorable and the market opened strong and
higher, chiefly on this account. Later In the
session offerings became more liberal and a
part of the advance was lost. November closed
at 41*4c an advance of %c. It sold for a time
at 421.6C
Oats were dull and trading. without feature.
Provisions were weak early and strong late
in the session. Heavy hog . receipts caused
some shading of prices at the start, but later

Weather Report.
Southern California â <71ear, warm weather
continued during the first of the week and was
followed lÂ»y heavy rainfall at the close. T,he
precipitation was general and wa5 unusually
UlU in some localities, about two Inches hav
lnÂ«r fallen in Los Angeles and vicinity, and
6.'J> inches In portions nt the mountain region
eround fan rMeso; at Ssnta Maria 1.35 Inches
le!I during Friday and .Saturday. The water
raprly has matorially Increased, and citrus
fruit trees have been benefited. The soil Is now
in irÂ«od condition, and farmers will berin
flowing and tending. No material damage has
fceen done by the storm, though orange plck
1np has been retarded. Walnut harvest Is coni
pteted.
Bsin Joaquln Valleyâ Remarkably heavy rain
followed the fair vreather prevailing at the
tep'.nr.Ing of the week, the precipitation at
Krefno and other points amounting to over
three inches. All r*rts of the valley have re
rf'Aed p?nerouE rainfall, and It appears that
the prrat wheat districts have been especially
favored. In factions where farming- operations
have t.-^on retarded by unfavorable conditions
the work of plowing and seeding will be im
mediately resumed with greater vigor, and the
acreage town to jrraln will undoubtedly sur
pass that of many previous seasons. Early
rown grain ar.d pasturaR? have been greatly
benefited. Alfalfa is making heavy growth.
Orange picking has been retarded by the rain.
t>ut no damage hi.s l.erÂ»n done. Orchardist*
liave commenced pruning.
Coast and bay sectionsâ Warm, cloudy
veather prevailed during the first part of the
vrek, followed by lower temperature and heavy
rain. The precipitation has been general
thrrmghout the section, axid will prove of great
benefit to mJl agricultural Interests, particular
ly in the southern and central counties, where
the absence of moisture In the soil was caus
ing some apprehension of drought. Farmers
in that section will now be able to rush the
delayed work cf plowing and seeding, and It
is expected a large acreage of grain will be
f.wn. Pasturage will also become plentiful.
The rain was not seriously needpd In the north
ern counties, but will be beneficial. In some
factions It Is said the eoll is too wet for plow-
Ing-. Hay and early cown grain are mailng
foi'd growth.
Sacramento Valleyâ ThÂ» weather has been
generally warm and cloudy during- the wÂ«^k.
Â»-lth somewhat lower tem;*rai.ure at the close.
The rain was ne*>ded in some sections, as the
fU was becoming too dry for profitable culti
vation, and has been beneficial in all sections,
l^r'.y sown grain Is making good growth.
Itanpe feÂ»-d Is In better condition than usual
st this time, being' very rich and abundant.
Cattle, sheep and hogs are In prime condition.
Good crops of corn, potatoes, beans and pump
klr.s are being pathere'd. Plowing and seeding
continue. The orar.ee crop is larger than usual
In porr.e sections, and the quality Is excellent;
X-lcking and shipping are In progress. A large
Â«:rop of olives Is being gathered.
Fo:!<vÂ»r!r.g !Â« the report cf A. O. McAdle, sec
tion director of the climate and crop service
of the Weather Bureau, for the w<Â»elc ending
Monday:
The Weather and Crops.
"In nuts. Imported walnuts attraot most ln
ttreÂ«t. French walnuts are strong and becom
ing closely cleaned U{>. O!en.>blÂ« Mayetes are
Crm at lie. I~iltÂ»erts are silgrhtly easier."
"Evaporated arrle? continue very firm, with
Â¦ probability of a reaction after to-day, which
Is thÂ«Â» lart for tirst half of November deliver
ies. To-day's developments, however, are like
ly to bÂ» lnterestir.gr, as there is a considerable
ehort Interest still to co\er.
"Prunes are In better demand, and the
teriiÂ«ncy teeir.s toward a better market.
tizea inoet wanted by the trade are 4O-5Ps.
DC'-60s and 60-7>"'s. Goods at lower than associa
tion prices both to arrive and on the 6pot are
harder to pet. Most offerings of Sonomas, to
arrive, at cut prices have disappeared. Some
each roods ar.d j-lso sent Santa Claras, how
ever, can still be bouKht at 'tc under the asso
ciation figures for lh*> four sizes. Apricots are
Cm and In fair demand. Peaches and pears
are Quiet- Dates shew fair activity. Some
busings Is reported In Smyrna figs at e'-^^sv^c.
but <5eir.and is light, the traflÂ» being well
Ftock^d up with OaJlforcia goods, and the
cheap prices reaiizfd at tbe fig sales tending
to r-^;rtet busings in the market generally.
"A ccnEiderably better feeling Is evident in
currants, and it Is not unlikely that there may
be an advajiee very eoon. There Is an Improve
ment in Inquiry, ar..i leading holders are not
disposed to shade prices. The California raisin
ir.arket continues very eary â "sick"â hotter ex
tiresses it. Rejections of carload lots from the
\VÂ«?st. b"th because of poor quality and in some
casÂ«-Â£ tardy arrival of eÂ«ods. have contributed
cateria^ly to the existing discouraging state of
eflairs. Demand :or raisins lrom the consum
ing trade Is slow.

of an Imposing aggregate of some of the
largelr capitalized Western railroad systems of
which the floating supply In the market is
always much larger than that of the more
flrr.ily established railroad properties In the
earlier settled portions of the country, but the
very fact of the enormous floating supply of
stocks hampers the price movements. To-day's
sales of Northern Pacific foot up according to
the customary approximate calculations, 201,000
shares for the common stock and 75,000 shares
of the preferred stock. & total of 277.400 shares.
The common stock rose an extreme 6Vi and the
preferrei 6S. Various causes doubtless 6erved
to congest the speculation In these stocks.
Thfre was but languid interest In the general
market and the eager army of operators and
speculators who are watching for available
openings failed to find any until the movement
In Northern Pacific developed. The volume and
character of the dealings in the stocks, how
mr, precluded the Idea of a purely specula
tive operation. No authentic news was dis
closed to exiilain the movement, such rumors
as were heard being prompted rather by tl>e
effort to explain by guesswork. It was alleged
that It had been determined to retire the pre
ferred stock at par. as the company has the
right to do under the terms of Its Issue. Tho
favorite theory, however, was that the buying
of Northern Pacific represents a process of
transfusion of Interests between the different
transcontinental railroad lines, or more Im
mocliately the Northern and Northwestern
routes. Such a process ie on the lines of what
has already bÂ«en accomplished on a large scale
In the Eartern trunk line field and Is in ac
cordance with the best accepted theory for a
solution of competitive problems in railroad
ing. That come important development will be
forthcoming Is indubitable by the testimony of
the ta^e. The movement in Northern Pacific
had a dominant effect on the whole market and
pulled it up effectively from the reactionary
interest which had overborne it during the
early part of the day. This was due to the con
tinued neavy profit taking and to very large
selling for London account after a light buy
ing movement for that account in the early
dealings. It Is believed that very large ship
ments of stocks, and especially of Northern
Pccifle, which have been sold for foreign ac
count since the election, are now on the ocean.
This would create a temporary shortage In the
supply available for borrowing purposes and
would add materially to the embarrassment of
a ehort interest. The profit taking continued
to a degree even after the general tendency
had become strongly upward and some of the
prominent stocks practically failed to respond
at all. ThÂ» movement In the iron and steel
stocks was exce<?<ilngly Irregular and a num
ber of other sr>ecialtles which had recent
notable advances hung back to-day. Ae a con
sequence the day's net changes were exceeding
ly uneven and not a few declines were mixed
In with the notable gains. The conspicuously
etrong stocks besides the Northern Paclflcs
were the Union Paclflcs, the Denver and Rio
Grandes and the Baltimore and Ohio. Among
the Industrials and specialties the Steel and
Wire stocks. Federal Steel. Tobaccos, People's
Gas, Sugar and International Paper were con
spicuous. After a sharp reaction on profit
taking the Northern Pacifies rallied, carrying
the whole market with them, and the closing
was buoyant and very 6trong at about the top
level. Profit taking was In evidence In tho

Nothing more was heard of Green until
he was shot in Denver. The recent mes
sages received by his brothers contain the
information that he is in a critical con
dition, but a special dispatch to Tho Call
late last night says that there is a chance
for his recovery.
On July 17 CJreen was dismissed from
the San Francisco Police Department.
Expecting his dismissal, he had prepared
lor the future, and many merchants suf
fered to the extent of several hundred
dollars. He hypothecated his salary war
rant several times and then commenced
to lay in a stock of goods. He purchased
large bills of clothing on Credit from Roos
Bros., Charles Keilus & Co., Cichtensteln
& Co. and tho Hub. Not content with the
necessaries of life, he purchased other ar
ticlfSj such as cameras and bicycles,
which he immediately sold. From Ham
mersmith & Field he s<Â»ured a diamond
ring worth $110. All of Green's creditors
believed him still to be in the department
in good standing.
As soon as the Police Commissioners
dismissed Green the merchants began to
flock to the office of Chief Sullivan. The
ex-officer had not yet left town and he
was sent for by the Chief. He treated
the matter of his debts lightly and paid
that he intended to pay them. Sullivan
allowed Green to depart and shortly after
allowed Green to depart and shortly
afterward several officers were put on his
trail armed with warrants.
Charles Green, the San Francisco police
officer who caused a sensation In depart
ment circles last July, is dying in Denver.
He was shot three times while serving
as a Deputy Sheriff on election day. Ever
since he deserted this city, with the law
at his heels, his whereabouts has been
unknown until the Denver tragedy hap
pened, and he appealed by telegram to
his brothers to hasten to his bedside be
fore he expired. The brothers of the un
fortunate police officer will leave for Den

The demand caused a hurried confer
ence between McCutchen and Mr. Moore.
McCutchen finally said; "We have no ob
jection to allowing Mr. Hayne to havÂ© the
copy."
Engineer Le Conte will resume his ex
pert testimony for the company to-mor
row.
"We believe that we are entitled to the
data In order that our expert may exam
ine It."
Hayne made a demand this afternoon
for a copy of the private memoranda
which Watklnson has been using. "I de
mand this copy on tho ground that the
original was refused to our expert, as we
think," said the city's counsel. "When
we wanted it Mr. Watklnson had gone
East, and when we applied to other ofa
cials of the corporation they said they
knew nothing about It.
Watklnson explained that he mado up
his construction accounts after consulting
with the heads of hts departments con
cerning the items which should be tabu
lated under that head or as maintenance
cost. All new work, said the witness,
went to construction.
Hayne asked for an explanation about
the missing tabulation, and Watkinson
admitted he did not know anything about
it. The statement might have been muti
lated and this data lost, for all he could,
say.
In the statement for 1886 no segreiratlon
for construction expenditures appeared,
but Watklnson eald he could supply tho
omission from his private memoranda.
which he carried in his pockets while tha
city experts were trying to find some re
mains of the burned books.
Hayne put Wa*kinson through a cotzrsa
upon the annual statements, with special
relation to the methods employed In. fix
ing the construction accounts. Tha
amount paid out for construction is
chargeable against the consumers In tha
fixing of water rates, the law being that
the company's Investments for construc
tion are entitled to an Interest return In
the revenue.
There was a flurry ihis morning because
Attorney McCutchen wanted to mtroduco
in evidence only the construction accour..
data contained in the company's annual
statements to the Ctty Council.
Attorney Hayne contended that If tha
company desired to use any part of tha
statements, the documents as a whoia
must go in as evidence. Tha lawyer.*
fought along those lines for a time, and
linaily Judge Hart sustained Hayne's po
sition.
The Contra Costa Water Company, prior
to Iss6. issued Ssw.OOO m bonus. Its divi
dend payments from iS79 to ISSo aggre

During President Watkinson's cross-ex

pany from its organization tn IStii to Jan

pany's revenue from ihe same source.
The water rates suit trial relapsed to
day to a dull routine of figures and cal
culations, with a few side issues about,
segregations of construction and operating
expenses. Attorney Hayne adhered close
ly to his line of. detailed objection at ev
ery stage where he could flnu a possible
loophole. His tactics are apparently thos<o
of an attorney who is bent upon making
a strong record for his client in the event
an appeal to a higher court shall be nec
essary.

"I have heard considerable criticism
about the lack of water pressure and the
condition of the Central avenue hydrant
on the night of the fire. I believe that
the matter should be probed to the bot
tom and the responsibility for the con
fused and expensive state of affairs that
existed on that occasion fixed. If it Is the
city"s place to see that hydrants are al
ways In working order let it be dono. If
it is the Contra Costa Water Company's
duty to keep the hydrants In order we
should see that they do it. We cannot
afford to have an occurrence like that
happen, again."
It was finally decided that the fire com
mittee of the Board of City Trustees
should make a thorough investigation and
report the results to the board at itu ir?xt
meeting. Chief Krauth say* that had the
water pressure been stronger and tho
hydrant in working order the damage
done would have been much less, f
While that fire was in progress every
endeavor made by the firemen to operatj
the hydrant mentioned proved fruitless.
It was the nearest plug to the scne of
destruction and much valuable time \vas
lost trying to turn on the water. Local
representatives of the Contra Ooeta
\\ ator Company asserted the day after
the fire that the hydrant was in good
working order and Intimated that the
firemen did not understand how to oper
ate it.
Trustee Schulte brought the matter up
at a meeting of the City Trusteert last
night. He said:

As the 10:30 train pulled Into Dwight
way Mrs. Agers attempted to cross in
front of it. She hesitated end evidently
became confused, for when the train was
almost upon her she stepped on the
track. The engine was backing up and
the pilot of the tender struck her, throw
ing her forward on her face. Her body
was tossed clear of the wheels. She at
tempted to rise, and the step of the first
coach struck her, breaking her right arm
and cutting open her scalp. Bystanders
rushed forward and drew her from the
track.
A. J. Brackett, who witnessed the acci
dent, said: "Just as Mrs. Agers got to
the track she looked up and saw tne in
coming train. She stopped and then,
started to run across the track in front
cf the engine. She was evidently con
fused by the approaching train."
Robert Poole was in the cab. He saw
the woman in danger and whistled for
her. but the warning was too late. Con
ductor Charles Cottrell said: "The train
was not a car's length from its stopping
place when Mrs. Agers was 6truck. I
did not know of the accident until we
stopped, but it seems from witnesses that
she deliberately walked in front of the
engine."
The unfortunate old lady was taken to
the home of her son, Robert Agers. at the
corner of Telepraph avenue and Dwight
way. She lingered through the afternoon
in "a semi-conscious condition. Although
she had unusual vitality her age was
greatly against her and the shock proved
too much.
The date for the Inquest has not yet
been set.

BRAXEMLAN'S AWFTJJ3
DEATH AT DELTA
Jauch.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 20.â Society Is
just now gossiping about a mistake of
Cupid which was found out before the
final step was taken and is wondering
why the engagement between John Sln
fleton and Mrs. Jennie Jauch ha-? been
eclared off and who took the first step
toward an estrangement.
"I had very good reasons for breaking
the engagement," said Mrs. Jauch to
day.
On the other hand Mr. S'ngleton has
been heard to say that he Is the o'.ie who
presented the glove to the lady. There
fore society does not know positively how
matters stand and is still guessing.
This is not Mrs. Jauch's first experience
with the mistakes of the little winged god.
About four years ago, wnen she was pret
ty Jennie Bonsall and lived at the home of
her father. Major W. H. Bonsall, she had
more suitors than almost any other girl
in the city. Of them all she preferred Dr.
Joseph \V. Jauch, to whom she gave her
heart and hand and whom she married
after a courtship In which it seemed that
both had made the proper choice. But
the beautiful wife, after nearly three
years of married life, thought differently
and applied for a divorce, which was
granted a little less than a year ago.
Soon after obtaining the divorce it be
came rumored that Mrs. Jauch had cap
tured the heart of the much sought for
millionaire, John Singleton. Mr. Single
ton and Mrs. Jauch were merely waiting
for a year to elapse from the time of her
divorce before she should be made Mrs.
Singleton, the mistress of the beautiful
Singleton court and of the Singleton mil
lions. All such hopes are at an end now,
and the society reporters who were hop
ing to soon be able to report a brilliant
wedding are as much disappointed as the
mothers' with unmarried daughters are
eiad. Â¦ _
Sudden Estrangement Between John
Singleton and Mrs. Jennie
SOCIETY GOSSIPS ABOUT
A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT
The Retail Clerks' Union has only been
In existence four months, but in that
short stretch of time it has accomplished
much for the purpose for which it was
organized â to secure early closing of
stores, so that employes could go home
to their families at a reasonable hour
every day. The merchants have fallen in
readily with the idea and given the clerks
their co-operation in a number of cases.
Thoy realize it is as much a benefit for
themselves to close early as it is for their
employee.
The merchants of the city who have so
far signified their intention of closing
early by signing the list are the follow
ing named: \V. Smith, clothier; D. Hy
man, clothier; Cohen & Co., tailors; Stln
bere & Co., shoes; N. Schneider, shoes;
Goldberg & Co., shoes; Westover & Co.,
furnishings; "The Outlet," tailors; Alex
ander & Co., shoes; M. Isaacs & Co.,
clothiers; M. Citron, clothier; Keller &
Fitzgerald, furnishings; Jacobs & Co.,
merchant tailors; M. Bock, tailor.
The crusade of the local Retail Clerks'
Union to secure early closing among all
the merchants Is meeting with unexpected
success and every day new names are be
ing added to the list being circulated
among the business houses requesting
that they close their doors at 6 o'clock.

The students In the physics classes are
not slow to condemn this ruling. They
claim that it not only brands the class
as thieves In general, but that the ex
traordinary assessment Is unjust. It is
bad enough they argue to be compelled to
pay for apparatus which possibly Is taken
by outsiders, but to pay ten times its
value Is more than they bargain for. On
the other hand Professor Slate says that
many of the articles are removed through
carelessness and that the ruling *ill put
a ftop to this.
The faculty of the college of social sci
ences and the president of the university
uphold the new rule. Thev believe Its
moral effect will be good, while the as
sessments, should it be necessary to make
them, will not be great on the Individual
student. If every one in the class is held
personally responsible for the articles in
the laboratories more care will be taken
of them and the chance of theft placad
at a minimum, so those in favor of the
rule believe.
Ten times the value of any apparatus thus
"removed" (without authority) from a labora
tory will be charged agaln't the class using
the room, and assessed equally upon all mem
bers of that class. FREDERICK SLATE.
Several pieces of apparatus of considerable
value have lately disappeared from the physical
laboratories. Such misappropriation of uni
versity property cannot be tolerated, and in
order to enlist public opinion among the stu
dents on the side of putting a atop to these
practices a rule has been adopted and will be
put In operation for the current term. The rule
has been approved by the president of the uni
versity.
BERKELEY, Nov. 20.â Several plcc?s of
apparatus have been stolen from tn**
physical laboratories at the University of
California and the students are held re
sponsible for them. According to the nil-
Ing Just put In force the class using the
room from which the apparatus has been
taKen must pay ten times th* value of the
stolen article to the university. The no
tice posted by Frederick Slate, prefssaor
of physics and dean of the college of
natural sciences, Is as followsu

This Tells The Story I
One Opinion taken from over one thousand testimonials
received from the most prominent physicians all over the world.
DAVID WALSH, BI. D., C. M. Edln., Physician to the ,
Western Skin Hospital, London, England, writes t
" I have found Hunyadl-Janos to answer every purpose and I invariably prescribe
it. partly because it can be obtained uny where and everywhere, partly because of its
uniform action, and last, not least, because it is preferred by my patients."

"Finally my attention was called to
Postum Cereal Food Coffee and we se-
cured some of It. It was prepared accord-
ing to directions, but breakfast being de-
layed the Postum got an extra boiling,
which developed all Its virtues, and we all
if 11 in love with Â«t from the first moment.
The change In bur physical health after
drinking Postum was something remark-
able. We have as delicious coffee as any
one could ask, but it is a perfectly healthy
coffee, and the more we drink of It, In
reason, the better we are. I am satisfied
that the increasing amount of heart diffi-
culty of late years among young people is
directly attributable to the use of cof-
fee, and It is a great blessing to have so
safe and delicious a food coffee as Pos-
tum. Pleaeff omit my name from publica-
tion." , Eaet Brookfield. Mass. Xame
given upon application to Poetum "Â¦ Cereal
Co., Ltd., Battle Creek, Mich.
"The first effect after drinking coffee
Â¦was that of delightful exhilaration and I
U3X courage and strength to attack almost
nay amount of active work, but In a few
hours the reaction came, with misery in
my chest, palpitation of the heart and
m<j?t unbearable pains In my stomach.
A eo-jvar-old woman writes: "My over-
Jndulcent papa used to say at the table,
â¢Why not let the child have what she
likrs? It won't hurt her any.' He re-
ferrr-d particularly to my drinking coffee.
whi^h I was very fond of as a child. He
besestly theught it didn't hurt me, for
wiih his strong' body, apparently without
n<?rv*Â»Â«. he wm not consciously affected
by coffee, but the effect on me â a bundle
Ot nerves â was to develop restlessness and
Ftur.t my pTOwth.
If parents could realize what a crime
they commit in permitting children to
have heavy drugs during their early life,
pueh drugs, for instance, as coffee, which
Ftunts their growth, prepares them for
dypp^psia and nervous â¢wrecks, they
would do anything, go to any amount of
trouble and care, to change the methods
and give their children the advantages
that nature demands to produce perfect

PROBABLE RATIO FOR THE
ALLOTMENT OF CONGRESSMEN
Representative Hopkins, Chairman,
of House Committee on Census,
Discusses the Matter.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. â Represen
tative Hopkins of Illinois, chairman of
the House Committee on Census, which
committee will have charge of the legis
lation affecting the apportionment of the
House, to-day expressed the opinion that
there would be no decided effort during
the next session of Congress to decrease
the Congressional representation of the
Southern States because of the dlsfran
chisement of negroes. He said that in,
all probability the subject would be dis
cussed, but he thought that upon the
whole the committee would fa.vor the plan
of basing representation upon the number
of Inhabitants. Discussing the general
subject of reapportionment, Mr. Hopkins
said:
"The Committee on Census will meet
during the tirst week of the session to
frame a bill providing for reapportion
ment. 1 think that a proposition will be
adopted which will increase- the present
membership of the House. It has been
suggested that we authorize one member
for every 19S.00O Inhabitants. That seems
to be the ratio in general favor among
members of the committee. This propo
sition would entail an Increased member
ship of from fifteen to twenty members.
"According to calculations I have made,
this reapportionment would add members
to the House from New York and Illinois
and perhaps other State. States like
Nebraska and Maine might lose members
by the proposed law. Some of the South
ern States might also suffer from the
proposition agreed upon, although to
what extent cannot now be ascertained."
SEEK TO MOB A
JUDGE IN HIS COURT
Attorney and Constable Drive Back
an Angry Crowd at the Point
of Drawn Pistols.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â "Back! Stand
back! The first one who comes over that
railing is a dead man!"
"With these words and with a revoTver
in his hand to make them good Attorney
John Trainer, assisted by Constable Henry
de' Young, saved Justice Peter de Young
from being mobbed in his own courtroom
in South Holland, in Thornton Township.
The demonstration against the magis
trate was brought about as a result of
the Justice's refusing to deal leniently
with Jacob Friesma. who had been ar
rested on a charge of conducting a "blind
pig."
When the rush was made toward the
magistrate Attorney Trainer and Con
stable de Young Jumped to the Jun!ee'3
side and drew their revolvers. They com
manded the crowd to fall back, but their
orders were only partly obeyed. Then -he
attorney for the defense asked tor a
change of venue and it was granted and
the magistrate signed the paper3 while
his two friends stood over him wita their
revolvers.

Alfred Harms-worth, Again Denies
That His Visit Will Be for the
Purpose of Starting a Paper. .
LONDON, Nov. 20<â In spite of contra
dictions of the report that Alfred Harms
worth, proprietor of the I^ondon Daily
Mail and othenpapera, was about to visit
the United States with the intention of
establishing a Daily Mall in New York.
Mr. Harmsworth has been bombarded
with cable dispatches from New York
asking for' particulars of" his "Intended
venture. To a representative of the As
sociated Press to-day Mr. Harmsworth
said: "The object of my present trip to
the United States and Canada, like my
previous one, is holiday making pure and
simple. After visiting the Dominion I am
poinsr to Southern California and thence
to Florida for tarpon fishinpr. I shall be
accompanied by Mrs. Harmsworth, my

to get a vacation, which I have not had

NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The general mis

copal church met again to-day in St.
Paul's. Bishop Cranston of Portland, Or.^
presided. The order of the day called for
a' discussion and adoption of- resolutions
on China, but the committee took up the
question of appropriation of money for
the several missions. Some of the appro-
Eriations made are: Porto Rico 310 0GQ'

the owner, Thdinas F. "Walsh, who has
just arrived hera from Parla. "Had the
prospective buyers been ready to pay over
$7,005,000 cash when the deal was flrat

why a lightship should be stationed off

Doric Behind Time.

Company was looking for the. steamer
Doric Monday night, but 6he is now

She Is looked for early this morning.
Steamer Mexico, Formerly the Man
auense to Sail Saturday Week.
The Mexican steamer Mexico, better
known as the British steamer Manauense,
will inaugurate a new line to the Gulf of
California next Saturday week. She may
have to go out under the British ffcig as
her Mexican registry has not arrived, but
should it not come on time she will hoist
the Mexican flag at Guaymas.
Captain von Helms, who was for years
on the steamers of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, will command the
Mexico. He is known all over the Gulf
and will run his ship to the best advan
tage. The Mexico will not call at San
Jose del Cabo and Magdalena Bay. but
will instead take in San Bias and Man
zanillo.
The Curacao, which runs under the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company's flag,
will make the round trip in twenty-one
days and the Mexico expects to cover the
distance in the same time.

the matter with him.
Now, Chief Engineer Kold is an athlete
and a boxer of no mean ability. When in
port he is always boxing with some well
known pugilist or exercising at the Olym
pic Club. He Is like Pitzsimmons. big
and bony, and strikes a blow like the
kick of a mule, so the firemen say.
When the fireman went back and Â¦ re
ported to his chief the latter at once took
the man back to the doctor. "Did you
say this man was not sick?" queried
Kold.
"I did," answered the doctor.
Then the chief engineer made the man
strip and show a number of sores on his
chest and back. .
"Do you mean to say that man Is nt
to work?" heathen asked.
"I say he is not."
"Then I'm a liar? suggested the doc
tor . â¢
"If you want to put it that way, yes,"
and as the chief said this, the doctor rose.
The chief engineer's left shot out and
the doctor was hors de combat. Just at
that moment the chief officer came along
and right behind him were the first and
second assistant engineers. There was a
general mix-up and Chief Officer Hopkins
got the worst of It. Then there was an
investigation and now Chief Engineer
Kold Is going East to enter business on
his own account, First Assistant Kngl
neer Benford is going East to take charge
of a large yacht and Second Assistant
Kalllsher is going East to visit his rela-
Thls'is the story told aboard the Logan,
but the officials on the transport assert
that no blows were struck and that it was
a "Quiet and orderly row." In any event,
the three engineers are going East and
Dr. Waterhouse and Chief Officer Hop
kins are not on exhibition.
Chief Engineer and Two Assistants Have Resigned
and Others of the Crew Are in Mourning.
TROUBLE AMONG THE OFFICERS ON
UNCLE SAM'S ARMY TRANSPORT LOGAN
ST. LOUIS. Nov. 20.â Delegate* repre
senting 1 thirty-seven Industrial organiza
tions, local and national, called together
to take action looking to the passage of
Senate bill No. U39. better known aa Cui
lom's bill to amend the Interstate com
merce, law, to-day adopted a memorial to
Congress which says:
"This Is a measure In wjilch the busi
ness Interests of the country are mora
largely concerned than In any other that
has recently been brought to the atten
tion of Congress, and Its enactment will
more directly affect a larger number of
citizens than any other now pending. The
bill has been before the public during the
past twelve months and has been freeiy
discussed in the public press with almost
unanimous approval, it has been formal
ly Indorsed by nearly all the commercial
bodies of the country of any Importance
and the demand for its Immediate enact
ment from all sections of the country
seems to be universal. This convention,
therefore, earnestly desires that your
honorable bodies will give this measuro
the precedence to which Its Importance
seems to entitle It and afford speedy re
lief to the public from prevailing evils in
the transportation of the country which
the present law has proved Inadequate to
remedy, by the early enactment of the
aforesaid bill."
Resolutions were adopted providing that
an executive committee of five members
be appointed by the chairman with full
power to take such action as It may deem
best to carry out the purposes of the con.
ventlon.
The resolutions also recommend * that
each body represented In the convention
send one or more delegates to Washing
ton upon the reassemb'ing of Congrress for
the purpose of exerting their personal
Influence and secure the co-operation of
the Senators and Repiesentatlves from
their respective States In the early enact
ment of the Cullom bill. All the commer
cial and Industrial organizations through
out the country are invited to unite in
thi3 movement.
Memorial to Congress Is
Adopted at a Meeting of
Commercial Men. :
Delegates Representing Thirty-Seven
Industrial Organizations, Local
. and National, Hold a Session

last night by a runaway horse hitched to
a buggy. The horse had been left stand

away and bumped into the car at the
crossing of Guerrero and Twenty-second
streets. Fortunately there were but few
passengers on the car at the time, and
they escaped without injury. The bujrirv
was knocked Into firewood. The car Md
Its. windows broken and much of the
woodwork demolished.
The buggy belongs to R. E..Lapham a

BY MISSING PRECINCT
Mr. Cowell admitted that the facts con
cerning the circular were true. Beyond
that he did not admit anything. He
smiled as he spoke of the Clenega and the
I X L lime plant, the former near Tres
Pinos In San Benlto County and tha latter
In Santa Cruz. He has bought the I X L,
as well as the Clenega plant. Some years
ago he contracted with the I X L plant
to take all their lime at $2 50 per barrel
for a period of five years. At the end of
that time he made a contract at a lower
rate, $2 per barrel. Then he declined to
make another contract and the I X L
Company went Into thÂ© market at cut
rates and tried to drive Mr. Cowell out
of business. The result was that the
I X L was eventually mortgaged for $75,
000. Cowell waited his time and took: It
In. Then thÂ© Clenega tried to take thÂ©
trade from Cowell. He met every ratÂ©
that his rivals made and they ended up
with an Indebtedness of $120,000. Cowell
bought In the property last week for $10.
000. He Is now the lime magnate of Cali
fornia north of Tehachapi and also of the
Puget Sound country, for "he has also the
control of the Roche Harbor Lime Com
pany.
Some Idea of the advance in the price
of lime Is derived from the fact that lime
has been sold here as low as 85 cents per
barrel and even lower In the height of
rate wars. Henry Cowell says that he has
teen losing money at even the recent rate
of $1 25 per barrel.
The combination of all local lima com
panies has brought about the expected re
sult. The price of lime has been, raised
and a circular has been sent out to the
trade, giving notice of the new rates,
which went Into effect last Monday. The
rates are set forth . as follows : Santa
Cruz lime, *1 60 per barrel in the store
in San Francisco; at Hincon and Santa
Cruz, $1 50 per barrel. As was forecasted
In The Call, which had the exclusive news
of the combine,- Henry Cowell & Co. and
the H. T. Holmes Lima Comoany have
come to an agreement. They are both,
sending out the same circular concerning
the new rates. Each concern professes
to regard the other as a competitor. The
truth Is that they are acting together.
The understanding Is that they have de
cided upon a percentage basis of division
of the business of thia section. Henry
Cowell yesterday denied positively that
he controlled the market. At the H. T.
Holmes Lime Company Mr. Cowell was
said to be the moving spirit.

;-.-For .the. purpose of- obtaining a speedy de
cision upon the proper construction of the con
stitutionality of the act, our attorney Is In
structed to use all Â¦ prooer means for the pur
pose of expediting a case In which this : point
can be decided."'
The â¢ Antl-Debrls Association takes tne
ground that the Sacramento Valley Is entitled
to protection from the 1 injurious effect of
hydraulic mining; that the courts are open for
the purpose of settling disputes between citi
zens and that an appeal from the decision of
the California Debris Commission lies, like it
does from any other commission, to the courts
of the land. We have been extremely anxious
to takeup some case to the highest courts in
volving this proposition, but so far the miners
have evaded the Issue. We are confident that
the courts of last resort will declare that no
man can Injure â¢ the property of his neighbor,
and If the. hydraulic mining is doing injury
to the rivers or valley interests below it will
be enjoined. The question is not whether a
miner has a permit to mine, but whether he
is living up to his permit-, and whether the
works erected In pursuance of It are sufficient
to prevent
The Anti-Debris Association is not formed
for the purpose of fighting shadows, but oper
ates for the purpose of preventing injury. In
some instances where permits have been grant
ed, upon examination made by the association,
it has been found that the mine-owners make
no attempt, to comply with the permit. They
build a system of restraining works contem
plated by their . application for mining, but
when their reservoirs become filled up they
empty them and In some cases , remove their
restraining works or a portion of them when
no on# Is watching them. In some instances
the California' Debris Commission has with
drawn permits for mines on account of the
bad faith exercised "by", the miners and their
disobedience of the terms of the permits
granted. ,- '
This association has commenced a number of
suits In which hydraulic mining and ground
sluice mining have been enjoined, t-pnd intends
to bring a great many more. In any one of
those casrs, or In all, the question of the suf
ficiency of the permit to allow injury to be
done can be argued.
The Antl-Debrls Association has caused many
of those dams to be examined by competent
engineers, and has found that several of them
are totally insufficient to restrain the hydraulic
mining debris. In some cases where the damb
were sufficient for a time the reservoirs have
been completely filled up, but hydraulic min
ing continues.
The Antl-DfbriB Association contends that no
one has the right to injure the property of his
neighbor except for a public use and then only
upon Just compensation being made. We be
lieve it is contended by the lUners* Associa
tion that if a permit has been granted by the
California Debris Commission to mine, the
miners have the right to continue hydraulic
mining, regardless of the Injury they may do.
We claim this is not a proper construction of
the law, and, if It be, that the law Is uncon
stitutional. We have been eager at all times
to submit this matter to the courts and In the
case brought by the county of Sutter against
the Red Dog mine claim, the defense made
by the miners was that they were operating
under a permit, but when the case came to
trial they withdrew this portion' of their an
swer. We are exceedingly anxious that the
constitutionality of this so-called - Caminetti
act .should be determined and In any one of
the number of cases brought by us the point
can be raised and determined, If the miners so
desire.
Under the so-called Caminetti act, permits
have been granted to various miners to mine,
and in some cases dams have been erected
which are sufficient to restrain hydraulic min
ing debris; In other cases these dams are ut
terly insufficient and the debris from hydraulic
mines pours over the crest of the dams and
enters the river channels below.
Prior to the passage of the so-called Cam
inetti act, the courts, both of this State and
tho United States, had decided that the rivers
could not be used as conduits for hydraulic
mining debris and that the landowners living
along the banks as well as the State Itself were
entitled to protection from tho injurious effects
ot hydraulic mining; in other words, it was de
clared by the highest courts of the land that
hydraulic miners should use their property so
as not to injure that of their neighbors.
That the association Is formed for the pur
pose of protecting the Sacramento Valley from
the injurious effect 'ot hydraulic mining and
Is. engaged in effecting for the Inhabitants of
the Sacrameuto Valley a substantial benefit
and is not concerned in combatting issues of
no practical importance.
Whereas, at the session of the miners' con
vention held yesterday in the city of San
Francisco, the statement was made by the
president of the association and other officers
thereof that the delay in testing the consti
tutionality of the so-called Caminetti act was
due to tho Anti-Debris Association; and,
whereas, this association In regular monthly
meeting assembled, believes Â¦ that the truth
should be made known; therefore this associa
tion does resolve as follows:
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 20.â In a series of
resolutions the executive committee of
the State Anti-Debris Association, in ses
sion In this city, this afternoon made an
swer to the allegations of bad faith pre
ferred by the president and officers of the
miners' convention In San Francisco. The
association declared that it stands ready
at all times to defer to the law as laid
down by the courts, and that Its sole pur
pose is to protect the Sacramento Valley
from what it declares is the injurious ef
fect of hydraulic mining. The association
Is composed of representatives, mostly
Supervisors, of the various interested
counties. - Suits are now pending in the
courts, brought at its instance, to restrain
certain mines from allowing their refuso
matter to flow dpwn into tho valley
streams, to the impairment of the chan
nels, and damaee to lands. Tho resolu
tions follow:

to refer them to the committee on resolu
tions without debate. There was one ask
ing for an effort to have in the lo
cation of land the burden of proof placed
upon the agricultural claimant instead .of
upon the mineral claimant, as Is at pres
ent the procedure, and also that
the locator prove that the land is
unoccupied. This was a measure
for the suppression of scrlppers. Then
there was the resolution on the freight
rate and another by Caminetti asking that
the right of a miner to locate on
lands Patented to the railroads as agricul
tural lands be ascertained and defined.
The afternoon closed with a paper by O.
S. Bresse, describing the mineral industry
of Southern California. It was a com
plete enumeration of the mines and the
metals of that portion of the State,
JUSTICE COOK WIIX

As was foretold in The Call several

form of a restraining order Vj prevent tho

candidates for the office. ,
Of the five only three are affected l>y

Police Handle Infernal Machine.
While walking along Mission street one
afternoon about ten days ago, Mrs. Hayes
of l&S Thirteenth street was met by a
email boy who very politely inquired of
her If she was Mrs. Hayes. Her answer
being In the affirmative, the boy handed
her a box, stating that a- gentleman had
requested him to deliver the package to
her. She accepted the gift and took It
to her home, where it remained until yes
terday, when her curiosity got the bet
ter of her and she took it to a drug
store at Howard and Erie streetB. The
druggist said it was an Infernal machine
and informed the police. Officer Ferrell
carried It to the station and a consulta
tion was held. The package was wrapped
in soft paper and carried to the Hall of
Justice. Captain Seymour has sent the
box to the Judson Powder Company for
examination. The police believe that the
box was sent by a practical joker.

SO FAR the Miners' convention has
attended strictly to business; to
the reading; and hearing of papers
and the presentation of resolutions
of more or less importance. But
to-day it will fight. There is In prepara
tion as pretty a fight as the association
has seen, and its opening skirmish was in
the meeting of the committee on resolu
tions last nicht.
The root of the trouble lies in the dis
inclination of the mining members of tho
association to elect as officers those in the
business of furnishing 1 ' or manufacturing
miners' supplies. They have no personal
objection to the merchants or manufac
turers, but they wish to avoid the appear
ance of running the association as an ad
junct to any man's businessâ and among
the stanchest supporters of this Idea are
eome of the merchants themselves. A
fight has therefore centered about the
candidacy of Julian Sonntag of the Giant
Powder Company, who says he is going to
try for the presidency of the association
this year. His opponent is E. C. Voorheis.
ex-State Senator, a mining man and one
known from one end of the mother lode to
the other.
Mr. Sonntag has announced his candi
dacy, and he has said he will run under
any circumstances that may arise, and so
it was that the resolutions committee felt
the flm of the trouble. It came In the
form of a resolution providing that no one
engaged as or employed by a dealer or
manufacturer of miners' supplies shall be
eligible to any office in the association.
There was much debate over the reso
lution, but it was finally tabled for two
reasons â one that it seemed to present an
issue which might cause dissension on the
floor of the convention because of Its di
rectness and again because it was con
sidered as more the business of the com
mittee on constitution and by-laws to pro-
Vide for the case. As It was, every man
present at the committee meeting, with
one exception, announced that he was in
sympathy with the spirit of the resolution,
and should Its application become possible
in the convention, they would vote against
any man not a miner who ran for office.
So the resolution will not come before the
convention.
The candidacy of Sonntag is a problem
that has confronted the association more
than once. Two years ago he announced
himself as a candidate for the presidency
against William C. Ralston, and the blt
4er fight that followed was ended only
when Jacob Neff, the Nestor of the asso
ciation, was announced as a candidate for
re-election after he had declared that he
would not run again, and he was carried
through on a popularity that could sweep
everything before it. Ralston was elected
vice president. Last year, on the retire
ment of Neff and the election of Ralston,
the association made Xeff an honorary
member, and in order to prevent ill feel
ing the name of Julian Sonntag was
coupled with that of the father of the or
ganization, and both were placed on the
honorary list. It was thought at the time
that a great honor had been done, and
perhaps it was believed that Sonntag's
ambition might be satisfied. He had been
an officer of the association for seven
>ears. and it might have been hoped that
he would feel that his laurels were bur
densome enough for any ordinary man.
But this year l:e has appeared as a can
didate, and the problem has to be
thrashed over again.
Sonntag has many personal friends, and
there are many more who feel that he
has done much for the association; but
the principle that the organization is for
the promotion of one of the greatest in
dustries of the State, it is claimed, is one
that the members cannot afford to forget,
and therefore the president at least must
be a mining man. Therefore It looks as
If the mining and the commercial men of
the association are in danger of being ar
rayed against each other, at least to the
extent of those who are friendly to Sonn
tag and those who are willing to oppose
tradition.
The commercial element of the associa
tion Is a large Cne. and it Is more power
ful than It is large. It is the element
that puts up most of the money and takes
In recompense only the advancement of
the mining businessâ and theirs. Several
of the commercial members are not in
favor of having any one but a miner in
office, however, and S. J. Hendy, the pres
ent treasurer, is earnestly advocating the
appointment of a bank in his place. The
row can only bo averted by some compro
mise on the floor of the convention.
Several interesting: papers, among them
the report of the commiUf-e on dams, and
a lively discussion on the subject of the
Caminetti law marked the session. The
discussion was precipitated by some re
marks made by Caminetti after reading
his report as chairman of the committee
on dams. In which he decried efforts to
assail the act under which the impound
ing of debris was made possible, and
known as the Caminetti act.
Senator Davis took up the cudgels in
defense of the scheme to test the law
and In doing so explained more fully than
he had explained the day before some
statements In the report of the committee
on legislation. He said that what had
been urged in the report was that until
the constlutionality of the law under
which the Debii3 Commission was acting
had been tested, miners could not know
just where they stood; and he urged that
some case of an aggrieved miner be taken
up by the association and by the States
and a test case made of it In order that
The City Attorney advised the Board of
Supervisors yesterday that it was In the
power of the board to permit the use of

Post meetings. A nominal rental, how

May Meet in City Hall.
the exact standing of the law would bo
determined before the highest court. The
association was not finding fault with tho
Debris Commission, Davis explained, but
it did desire to find out if the law was
of any value.
Caminetti, the author of the law, de
clared that it would be better for the as
sociation to take the law as it was and
not try to undermine it and at the same
time keep capital out of the hydraulic
mines.
J. P. Halloran, chairman of the com
mittee on mines and mining, read the first
report of the day. He devoted his paper
to an exposition of the progress being
made toward the establishment of a de
partment of mines In the Cabinet. The
fdea, he said, is growing in favor; reasons
and arguments without number had been
advanced In its support, and the wisdom
of establishing such a department was
now not doubted.
The report of the committee on dredg
ers and jetties, prepared by Thomas J.
Barbour, was read by the secretary of tho
convention. Mr. Barbour described the
dredger industry, the cost of the work and
the results. He described the Industry In
each county in which gold dredgers arc
at work, and he gave some valuable fig
ures compiled by dredger men in various
localities. There are now at work in the
State twenty dredgers, he said. The re
turns from each are between $75,000 and
$195,000 a year, and the total Is somewhere
over $1,000,000. L. P. Crane, president of
the Petroleum Miners' Association, gave
some interesting figures and facts about
the growing oil industry. Petroleum, he
said, is the growing industry of
the State. It yield3 sixty products
which the world cannot do with
out, and the question is even now being
agitated as to how It may be substituted
for coal. The factory interests of the
State depend on two products, he con
tinued, gold and crude petroleum, and It
will not be long before California can
compete with the factories of the East.
There is* invested In the oil interests In
this State $34,000,000, mostly outside capi
tal, and the value of the land known to
be oil-producing- has been set by the own
ers at $116,000,000.
TV. L. Watt was then introduced to give
some idea of the commercial aspect ol
the oil situation. He said that in three
years the industry had Increased from an
output of 12,000 barrels to an output last
year of 2,600,000. In 1S96 it was 12,000; In
1S97 it had risen to 1,900,000; in 189S it was
2.200,000, and In 1S93 the output was 2,400,
000 barrels. It was afterward stated that
the yield this year will amount to at
least 4,000,000 barrels. In 1S96, Mr. Watt
said, there were 650 producing wells and 100
prospect wells; last year there wer# 1500
producing wells and 470 being driven for
prospects. Then he entered into a de
scription of tho different kinds of petro
leum found In the State and their rela
tive values.
Louis E. Aubrey of Los Angeles read
a paper on freight rates that later called
forth a. resolution that may bear fruit in
the future. He described how, under ex
isting circumstances, ore was charged for
under a rate schedule dated September 15,
1&99, which he lead, at the rate of $100 per
ton. a rebate to be made on the showing
by the report of the smelting works that
it was lower than the $100 rate called for.
It was an exemplification of the theory of
"all the traffic will bear," said Mr Au
brey. He asked what right the railroad
company had to inspect the result of the
assay. Under the schedule, he said, a
man rqight ship ore he valued at $50 a
ton on a supposed rate of $5 a ton, but
when the assay at the smelter showed a
value of $75 a ton he would find he had to
pay $2 50 a ton more. There would be
some reason, he said, if the rate was
made contingent upon the valuation of
the ore by the owner, for then in case of
,loss the shipper could only-regain the
value ho had placed upon it.' It Is true, he
paid, there is a theory that a shipper can
recover full value regardless of what his
first valuation might be, but there had
never been known a case where a man re
covered more than the valuation he
placed upon his own shipment even if he
recovered that.
Later in the day a resolution asking
that the fixing *of the rates on ore be
brought to the attention of the Interstate
Commerce Commission was referred to
the committee on resolutions.
A. Caminetti opened the afternoon pro
ceedings with his report on "Impounding
dams." Â¦ e
Since the last report of the committee
said Mr. Caminetti, the Debris Commis
sion had had in charge the construction of
restraining works on the Yuba River
which, without injury to the navigable
stream below, or the adjacent lands
would restrain at moderate cost all the
debris that would come down the river for
the next twenty years. Mr. Caminetti
then proceeded to explain in detail the
plans for the restraining dams, and the
preliminary work that had to be done to
explain and perfect the plans and bring
them into favor. When completed the
works would cost, he said, $800,000. Al
ready $500,000 had been appropriated In
equal amounts by the Federal and Stata
governments, but $300,000 more would be
necessary, and the committee recommend
ed that it be appropriated in the same
manner. Suitable resolutions bearine
upon this will be passed by the associa
tion before adjournment
Regarding the work of* the Debris Com
mission the report says:
It is a source of great regret that litigation
has ensued concerning hydraulic mining opera
a H S r! n J, h1s Â» State on th * suKBestlon of the
Anti-Debris Association, at a time when pro
posed plans promise so much both for the
miner and the farmer. , - ..
Bearing in mind that under the provisions of

is made the basis of operations, and that said
report provides restraining works in all the
tributaries of the navigable portions of the
hacramento and San Joaquln river systems

count of his flight from Nome is promised

An unimportant witness was A. Ander

merely testified to his identity.
Geary and Hall were at loggerheads all
through the examination, the attorney as
suming: that Knight was fleeing from jus
tice and the witness placing his friend In
the position of a persecuted man.
Questioned as to whether he knew that
Knight intended to secure from Reese a
second affidavit supporting the first when
the St. Paul stopped at Port Townsend.
Hall said he knew nothing of it.
"Under any circumstances?" said Geary.
"Well," said Hall, after seeking inspira
tion from the celling, "Mr. Knight was
probably afraid of being compelled to
winter In Nome, and that â "
"Is that your answer?" put in Plllsbury.
"I thought it was the commencement

Hall at length said that he nought
Knight had been badly used. He had
heard nothing of the attorney's payment
of $2000 to Reese for the affidavit, nor of
a payment of |750 to tho same Individual
for his "expenses to New York." "Mr.
Knight would not do such a thing," was
the way Hall expressed hi3 opinion.
Later on Hall told of Metson'i boast
that his friendship to Geary held him
immune from the threat of imprisonment
that hung over the other attorneys' heads.
Hall said he had heard both the litigants
characterized as "rotten." He told of the
general dissatisfaction existing in Nome
over McKenzie's appointment by Noyca
as- receiver of the "Discovery" only a
few hours after his arrival in Nome. The
witness did not believe, in answer to a
question of Pillsbury, that Knight could
have remained there and receive*! fair
treatment.
Hall wriggled and twisted in his seat
and smiled at Heacock and at Geaiy and
at Pillsbury ' and then remarked that
"Under the circumstances â "
"Now, Mr. Hall," thÂ© former Congress
man had said, "what would you, as an
attorney, think of a man who having, as
Knight did, in answer to a Judge's de
mand to see charges against him, told
the Judge that he could produce an affi
davit sustaining them in two hours, then
fled like a criminal in the night, leaving
the man against whom he had made these
charges shut off from the outside world
by an arctic winter, powerless to say a
word in his own defense to that outside
worldâ what would you, not only as an
attorney, but as a man, think of such an
action V'
On Saturday last Attorney A. C. Hal
sted of Los Angeles had, under Geary's
questioning, told the court how ha had
been called into Knight's cabin, which
he shared with the attorney, and asked
by him to pay particular attention to the
conversation which should follow between
Knight and Reese in reference to the
affidavit which Reese had marie at
Knight's request, assailing the judicial In
tegrity of the Circuit Judge of Alaska.
Yesterday Attorney Gordon Hall, who
was one of the Nome legal fraternity,
and George D. Bunker, both of whom
were also present in the cabin occupied
by Knight at the time of the conversation
concerning the intrinsic worth of tho
charges made by Reese and his good faith
In supporting them, corroborated Hal
stead's testimony as to what took place
on that occasion. In the case of Hall an
interesting bit of Nome's unwritten legal
history was divulged In his testimony
when he told of the fear felt by the at
torneys who had sided against NoyÂ«;s in
the appointment of McKenzie as receiver
of the Discovery mine, that their winter's
stay in Nome would be made compulsory.
Hall said the pros and cons and possibil
ities and the powers of Noyes in this mat
ter had formed the subject matter of
many a legal heart-to-heart talk on tho
Rialto of the city of the golden shore. In
this connection he put up a strong defense
for Knight's flight in answer to a ques
tion by Geary.
Attorneys Pillsbury and Geary thrashed
over yesterday the same facts as had been
presented at the last hearing of the case,
with the aid of three witnesses who had
been present in the cabin of the St. Paul
when Knight had interrogated Reedfl en
the affidavit and what its drawing up
had "stood him in for."

Fritzl Scheff is a piquant, petite person
age, and she sang- a lightsome and fetch
ing Zerlina, the village beauty. She was
in stronger voice last night than on Mon
day evening, when she sang in "La
Boheme," and possesses a very pleasing,
clear, light soprano voice. Which re
minds me. Mea culpa! peccavi! and all
the repentant rest of it, I must say, in
that I unwittingly "disremembered" the
former production of "'La Boheme" in San
Krancisco, with Jklelba as Mimi, now
many moons ago, and yesterday named
this week's presentation as the second,
not third, production of the pretty opera
here. It goes without saying that had I
heard Mme. Melba on the first occasion It
â¢would not have been so easilv forgotten.
To-r.ight "Tar.nhauser" will be given
again, with the same splendid cast as last
week.
Mme. Gadskl was the Donna Elvira, and
though net in quite so exquisite voice as
usual, or perhaps in hardly so kindly air,
the was an eminently sweet and charming
Elvira.
The opera offers opportunity for the ap
pearance of any three principal sopranos,
and last night Xordica. GadÂ«Â«i and Kritzi
Schen* were heard in the respective parts.
ilme. Nordica was heard as Donna Anna,
and gave her Invariably dignified and con
scientious conception of the role. She is
in congenial atmosphere In the tragic part
and sang last night with much grace and
sweetness.
Salignac developed rather a weak and
nasal tenor as Don Ottavio, and the Oom
mendatore part was well sung by Journet.
iJdouard de Keszke was amazingly well
BUlted in the part of Lieporello. He was,
to the life, the supple, easy-conscienced,
loose-lived Italian Knave, and his per
formance all through was an unctuous
level In the possibilities of the part. ThÂ«
famous "catalogue" song was given with
a lavish richness of comic euggestion ab
solutely Irresistible, and, it goes without
saying, gloriously sung. Pini Corsi was
in charge of the minor buffooneries of
Jkiasetto. and gave a cleverly stupid, stub
born picture of the ill-used bumpkin.

of the opera. .Don Giovanni â a character,

eliding his part in pleasurable fashion,
ana with just the right note- of tender
and sensuous insinuation. It lacked a ilt-
Ue in bravado, impudence; there was not
sufficient suggestion of the swash
buckling element, not less intimately
associated with the Don Giovanni role
than his over-gallant roguery. But 'twas
& good conception, well sung and acted.
The "La. ci darem," charming as ever,
was delightfully given.
But how strangely thin seems the or
chestration, how lacking in tone-colorâ the

depth and height and breadth, and yet.
withal, how charmine;!
In this opera, more surely than in al
most sjr.y other still sung, one may judge
Ot the vast stride that has been made In
this form of art. One may hear, too;
therein echoes of things lost, a fine sim
plicity of life, an elegance of leisure, an
urbane and gentle air of days unhurried.
It lacks entirely the strenuous, complex
note, so characteristic of latter-day work,
this product of the graceful childhood of
the art, but its cuave and facile move

Mill pleating and grateful to the ear.
