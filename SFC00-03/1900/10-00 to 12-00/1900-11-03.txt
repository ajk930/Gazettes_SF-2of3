VOLUME LXXXVIIIâ NO. 150.
CHICAGO, Nov. 2.-Willlam J.
Bryan's programme In Chicago
to-day composed twelve speeches.
The crowds that greeted him were
greater than those at the meet-
Ings of yesterday and last night.
The candidate began his Itinerary at Han
del Hall, In the downtown business dis
trict, going from there to the public, li
brary, where he spoke to an outdoor
gathering of workingmen. After luncheon
he made two addresses in the Old Vienna
Pavilion, at Sixtieth street and Cottage
Grove avenue â one to the crowd in the
building and the other to the throng that
was unable to gain admittance. Here was
the only semblance of disturbance mani
fested. Two men in the audience asked,
almost simultaneously. "How about
North Carolina?" and Mr. Bryan was re
plying when one of the questioners in
sisted on asking a question concerning
trusts, whereupon the crowd demanded
that he be thrown out, and threatened to
lynch him.
Mr. Bryan Insisted upon answering
however, but could not do so for some
time, owing to the uproar made by the
crowd In expressing Its resentment to
ward the questioner. The latter was
saved. from violence 'only by police inter
ference.
Mr. Bryan's night meetings were held
on the North. West, South and Southwest
sides of the city, the closing speech being
made at midnight at State and Thirty
sixth streets.
At the "Old Vienna" meeting Mr. Bryan
said:
"Nothing is too sacred to be attacked by
the Republican party in Its greed for gold
and for foreign lands. And I want to
show you that when we denounce these
methods that the Republicans now em
ploy, when we deny their destiny doctrine,
we are only saying what the Republicans
themselves have said In the past. I want
to read you what the Republican candi
date for Vice President said on this sub
ject Inâ well, the book was published In 1S99.
copyrighted for the first time in 1S96: 'The
general feeling in the West upon this sub
ject after It was crystallized, is what be
came known as the "manifest destiny"
idea, which reduced to its simplest terms
was that It was our more than manifest
destiny to swallow up the lands of all
adjoining nations who are too weak to
withstand us, a theory that forthwith ob
tained Immense popularity , among all
statesmen of easy International moral
ity.' (Applause.)
"They tell you it Is destiny, manifest
destiny. Mr. Roosevelt described mani
fest destiny as the idea of swallowing up
those who are too weak to withstand us.
The only difference between the manifest
destiny that he denounces and the mani
fest destiny which he and the Republican
party now support is that when he de
nounced the destiny It was swallowing up
adjoining lands, and the destiny he sup
ports crosses an ocean 7000 miles wide" to
swallow outside lands." (Applause.)
Quoting again, he said, from Governor
Roosevelt, he read the following: "'Of
Chesliam Honored.
. LONDON, Nov. 3.â Baron Chesham has
been appointed master of the buckhounds.
SANTA CRUZ, Nov. 2.â An Immense
brown ' bear was - killed . three miles from
Boulder Creek yesterday.. It will be

Bear Steaks for Voters.
"The Republican party is under the con
trol of those who seek advantage througn
governmental favoritism and grow rich
by the exploitation of citizens at home
and subjects abroad. It 1b a fight between
Democracy on the one side and plutocracy
on the other, and Democracy appeals to
the judgment and to the ' conscience of
those who, are willing to let live as well
as to . live."
"The poor are coming to the Democratic
party because they want a chance In the
race for life and many of the well-to-do
are coming because they realize that tha
Democratic party affords better protec
tion to honest wealth than the Republican
party.
"The small business men and the pro
fessional men are also feeling the effect
of the industrial despotism which has
grown up with this administration.
"The Republicans are now hoping to
hold their strength , among the farmers,
but they have no policy which will ben
efit the farmer. The man who makes his
living on the. farm-Is the victim of all
the vicious legislation for which the Re
publican party is responsible and receives
none, of the benefits conferred by special
legislation upon corporations and syndi
cates. The farmer pays more than his
share of the taxes and receives less than
his share of the consideration of govern
ment. Republican policies have lessened
the value of farm lands, increased the
proportion of tenants and have driven tho
farmers' â¢ sons away.- from , the farm, thus
intensifying' the struggle for existence in
the cities. The farmers 'are almost unan
imously opposed to the trusts, and they
can have no sympathy with the Imperial
istic policy of the Republican party, with
its attendant increase In the military es
tablishment. . I believe that the election
will show: that we have gained amonjc
the farmers as well as In the cities.
"The Republican campaign has been a
failure. The full, dinner pail argument
has been repudiated by the workingmea
and the Republicans are compelled to con
fess that a large proportion of the labor
vote will be cast for the Democratic
ticket. Besides believing with the Demo
crats in the general doctrine of equal
rights to all and special privileges to none,
the laboring men are against the trusts,
the large army and the colonial policy.
The laboring men are also drawn to the
Democratic party by the fact that our
party is opposed to government by In
junction, to the blacklist and to Chinese
Immigration, and in favor of arbitration
and of a Cabinet officer selected to rep
resent the wage-earners.
to-night gave out the following statement
in the form of an interview:
course, no one would wish to see this or
any other settled community now added
to our domain by force; we want no un
willing citizens to enter our Union.' "
The speaker added: "That Is what It
was then: 'We want no unwilling citizens
to enter our Union.' That is what Mr.
Roosevelt said then. That is what we say
now; but the Republican party has
changed."
Mr. Bryan continued reading: "'The
time to have taken the islands was before
settlers came upon them. European na
tions war for the possession of thickly
settled districts, . which, conquered, will
for centuries remain alien and hostile to
the conquerors.' There he recognized that
when you take people by force they will
for centuries remain alien and hostile to
the conqueror."
Again reading: "'We, wiser in our
generation, have seized the waste solitude
that lay near us, I he limitless forests, the
never-ending plains, the valleys of the
great lonely rivers and have thrust our
sons into them to take possession, and a
score of years after such conquest we see
the conquered land teeming with a people
that is one with ours.' . .
â¢ "That ; was good â¢ Republican doctrine
then, but the. Republican party has de
parted from the old Ideals. The Republi
can party has accepted European doc
trines and to-day the Republican party
stands for those policies which have. been
employed by European empires and which
have cursed both the empires and the
colonies. We do. not believe in the hold;
ing of colonies. Â¦ We do not believe in hold
ing over people a government to which
they are hostile. We "do not want them to
be aliens for centuries to come. We aro
not willing to curse this nation or tho
Philippine Islands with a carpet-bag gov
ernment held in force by a large standing
army." (Cheers and continued applause.)
At another point in his speech Mr.
Bryan said:
"One of our Democratic speakers in thl3
city by mistake got to the wrong meeting
the other night. There was a Republican
meeting In the same town where he was
advertised to speak. He went- out alone
and he got into the Republican meeting
by mistake. He told the doorkeeper that
he was one of. the speakers and went up
on to the platform, and the man who had
charge of the meeting said to him: 'Don't
say anything about pulling down the flag
here, we are not discussing imperialism. 1
(Laughter and applause.)
"He said: 'But how can a Democrat
make a speech without discussing that?'
The chairman said: 'Are you a Demo;
crat?' The speaker said: 'Yes.': The
chairman said: "'Then this is the wrong
meeting.' (Laughter and applause.) Now,
my friends, that took place, and the Dem
ocrat who had that . experience \ served in
Congress at the same time that I did. No
wonder- they don't talk about Imperial
ism." Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢ Â»I!ill . r

As if In appreciation of the closing of
the campaign, the Governor said:
"There really is not very much to say
now in the closing days of the campaign.
People have' pretty much made up their
minds and I think that we are going to
give in this State the second largest ma
jority it has ever given."
"That's right." "that's right," shouted
a number in the audience.
"But," continued the Governor, "I don't
want any man to make the mistake of
taking anything for granted. We want
not merely to whip Bryanism. but to
crush it under our heels.
"I ask you to stand by the party that
succeeds and not the party that fails; for
the party that maJtes financial policies
that work and not the party that advo
cates financial policies that won't work;
for the party that fought to a finish the
Spanish war and hoisted the flag in the
Philippines, and not the party that grum
bled about how the war was fought and
now. want to haul down the flag in the
Philippines." . ' - Â¦
Just as the train was pulling out of

day. A stone was thrown, breaking the
glass in the observation window in the

eral McCook and his staft and escort at
Bowling Green at half-past 9 o'clock. He
will then proceed up Broadway to Worth
street. There at 10 o'clock the tremendous
army of patrots will fall in behind and
march up Broadway to Waverley place,
thence west to Fifth avenue and up that
thoroughfare to Fortieth street, where the
parade will be dismissed.
Unless all expectations fail this will be
the most triumphal of all parades ever
seen here. In its vast column will be rep
resented every .line of business that can
well be thought of as identified with this
great metropolis.
There will be companies representing
the Wall street district, coal and iron
trades, lumbermen, shoe ar I leather
trades, telegraphers, paper and associat
ed industries, building trades and vari
ous exchanges.
Thera will be thirty-eight divisions In
the line, the head of which is expected
to reach the reviewing stand at Madison
Square at 11 o'clock. If tue 133.000 mea
parade It cannot possibly complete its
march before 10 o'clock to-morrow night,
even though it start promptly and be
kept marching without pause.
Realizing that much of the parade must
naturally extend into the night a grand
display of fireworks has been arranged
for half-past 7 o'clock in Madison Square
and from the roof of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance building at No. 1 Madi
son avenue, where the Republican State
, headquarters are located.
Only isolated spots in Broadway and
Fifth avenue lacked decorations to-day
when flags and bunting flew from win-,
dows and cornices of buildings for blocks
to the east and west of those thorough
fares, and almost all the buildings In the
lower section of the city were profusely
draped.
When the sound money parade moves
up Broadway to-morrow those who take
part in it will have an opportunity to ob
serve the effect of the opposlt* - of Tam
many Hall, as swung across the street
all along the line of march are Democrat
ic banners.
Workmen, who acknowledged that they
had been hired by Tammany leaders, were
engaged all to-night in hanging these
banners on poles, many of them having
been previously erected.
One ef the most popular of these ban
ners, judging from the frequency with
which it was displayed, reads as follows:
"They make you parade, but they can
not make you vote against Bryan."
Another popular motto is: "It Is a trust
parade and not a Republican parade."
At Mall street and Broadway there Is
hung across the route of #narch a broad
white streamer, which bears this motto:
â¢â¢iilcKinley's badge Is on my coat, but
Bryan's Is near my heart. God bless
him."
Similar streamers and banners were at a
late hour to-night being thrown across
Fifth avenue, between Twenty-third and
Fortieth streets, and altogether the men
who march will have a chance to read
plenty of silver literature on their long
tramp in the interest of the gold stand
ard.
No less than 135,000 men will march in the sound money
parade of the Republicans at Hew York to-day. This monster pa
geant will start at 1O a. m. and will be in motion twelve hours.
NEW YORK. Nov. 2.â Between

SOCIALISTS CAUSE A RIOT.
Raise Red Flags and Kick at Old
: Glory in Chicago. ' .'Â¦'-..;
CHICAGO.. Nov. 2.â Socialist orators
raised the red flag in State street '.to-night
and. were driven off the thoroughfare by
the police, who were compelled to inter
fere to stop a riot. The Debs speaker*
occupied . a half-dozen wagons to speak
from along the street/"-: Â¦
There were frequent clashes between th<j
speakers and the big crowds who gathered
around the stands. Shortly after midnight
the Socialists became bolder and a red
flag was raised on every wagon. The red
flag was very large, and in contrast was
hung a flag of the United State* of very
small dimensions.
The crowd took all this good naturedly,
until some of the Debs speakers began
kicking at the American flag. In a mo
ment there was confusion, and. along the
street several of the orators were dragged
from their wagons and roughly handled,
until the central detail police wagon was
called. Sergeant Mahoney ordered the
Debs wagons to leave the street, and they
were escorted away, followed by the po
lice patrol. A mob of 1000 people followed
them until they disappeared In the shad
ows of Lake street.

dictments against Walter C. McAllfster,
George J. Kerr. William A. Death and
Andrew Campbell, whd^are charged with
the murder of Jennie Bos.Â«chleter, who

were two indictments against each of the

for criminal assault, the first. It Is said,

Judge BarkaloW" received the Indict

It is not known when Justice Dixon will

It Is said that while the Grand Jury was

but they were In the minority. The hack

Bishop Kavier, who reached the coast
after his successful defense of the Peitong
cathedral, estimates that 200 native Chris
tians were killed in the i 'eking division
alone. .
On the west side of the Fen River, near
Plnglangfu, the people took Christian men
and women and with knives cut a cross
on their foreheads, then tortured and
killed them. On August 22, the writer
says:
"The hiding place of Dr. McKay has
been found. Some local rebels, pretend-
Ing- to be Boxers, captured him and are
holding him for a ransom. August 7 the
Governors of Yushlen, of Shansi, ordered
the people in every town and village to
practice the Boxer arts, and now all are
practicing. The persecution of native
Christians in Shansi are Indescribable.
All the homes of the Christians and in
quirers in the country about the city have
been destroyed. The wives and daughters
of- the Christians have been shamefully
treated and tortured.
"No steps have been taken to punish the
Taotai who handed over for slaughter the
Thompsons and their children, the Wards
and their children. Miss Mancheuter and
Miss Desmond; and now he holds â¢ in
prison the evangelist who saw Dr. Ward
Killed, lest he should give evidence against
him. That official is forcing the unhap
py man to write false letters, distorting
the facts of the massacre." '
On July 24 the mission premises were
burned and the next day the Pingiang
ladles' home was burned. The Chinese
took Mr. Peng and killed him and burned
live houses of the Christiana, using vio
lence to make four men worship their
idols.
The Christians sought the protection of
thÂ« local officers, who commanded them
to recant The Boxers ordered them to
draw lots before the Idols, and if the lot
came upward they , considered that they
had been sincere In recanting:, . but If
downward they considered them Insincere
and killed them.
On July 16 Mr. and Mrs. McConnell, with
their little girl, Miss King and Miss Bur
ton, together with Mr. and Mrs. Young,
came from Klkichow. On arriving at SI
kiao they were surrounded and on July 16
were decoyed to the banks of the Yellow
River and killed.
"The foreign religion is detestable be
cause it despises the gods and harasses
the people. The Boxers will burn the
house3 of all Christians and kill them."

removed before the millionaire's body was

To a reporter. Short said: "I went to
Mr. Rice's apartments at the request of
Mr. Patrick. Patrick sent a messenger to
my office. I went over to Patrick's offlce.
Patrick said to me: 'You are wanted up
tc.wn to execute some papers."
"Morris Meyers went with me. He
went as a notary, I as commissioner of
deeds. When we reached the apartments
Jones 1.=t us in and escorted us to Mr
Rice's room. Mr. Rice was pitting at his
df-pk and from a. sort of cabinet compart
ment that was over it he drew out his
papers. He said to us both: 'This Is my
will, gentlemen. I have sent for you to
witness my signature.'
"He a?ked Meyers to read one particu
lar paragraph or phrase in the will. I do
not remember what the subject matter of
the clause was. I did not- pay any atten
tion to It. Mr. Rice seemed to have much
conndence in Meyers. He .consulted him
nbout his affairs frequently. I did not
know the contents of the will, which wan
not read aloud. I frequently executes
papers for Mr. Rice. I executed the as
signments to Patrick."
Mr. Short further said he never talked
with Meyers or Patrick about the will or
assignments. He had known Mr. Rice
for about a year before his death. Mr
Rice had not said anything to him about
another will.
MURDER THEORY FIRST
CONFIRMED BY REPORTS
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â William L.
Strong, the last Mayor of the
old city of New York, diea sud
denly at 3 a. m. at his residence
In this city. Mr. Strong had not
been at his place cf business for several
days, but no one suspected that his condi
tion was alarming.
Mr. Strong took an active part In the
present campaign, and It is said that his
political labors, combined with his at
tempts to retain eupervision over his busi
ness affairs in the face of impaired health,
brought about the illness that resulted in
his death.
William L. Strong was born In Ohio In
1827 and came to New York when a" young
man. He found employment with different
firms until January 1, 1S70, when he or
ganized the firm of "William L. Strong &
Co. The firm soon grew to be one of the
prominent business houses in the city. He
also interested nimself in banking mat
ters and was president of the Central Na
tional Bank. Mr. Strong was one of the
leaders of the reform movement in this
city and was elected Mayor on the Repub
lican-Citizens' Union ticket in 1S94. He
was the last Mayor of the old city of New
York before consolidation with Brooklyn
and the other boroughs composing tne
present city.
At the time of his death Mr. Strong was
a member of a number of . societies, in
cluding the Ohio Society. American Fine
Arts Society, American Museum of Natu
ral History, Metropolitan Museum Asso
ciation and American Geographical Soci
ety.
Mr. Strong had been in poor health for
about six weeks. He ate supper as usual
last night and did not complain of any
pain or weakness at that time. At about
11 o'clock he retired to his bedroom, as
elsted by two nurses who had been in at-
tendance from the beginning: of his illness.
About an hour after he had gone to bed
he awoke and told one of the nurses that
: he was very weak. He asked to have his
wife and, son. Major Putnam Bradlee
Strong, called. They soon came to the
room. When Mr. Strong saw his wife he
put his arm about her and said: "I am
very weak. I am very, very weak."
Mr. Strong grew a little better, and as
his condition did not seem alarming the
physician wa3 not sent for. His daughter,
Mrs. Shattuck, and her husband were
called, however. A little before 3 o'clock
Mr. Strong seemed to have a decided
change for thÂ« worse and his physician
was nastily summoned, but he did not ar
rive until after the patient's death.
At a mass meeting in Madison-square
Garden in 1S94 a non-partisan committee
of seventy was appointed to organize the
opposition to Tammany Hall, to frame a
platform and select candidates for office,
and It was this committee that selected
Mr. Strong to run for Mayor on the re
form platform. His opponent was Hugh,
J. Grant and the contest was a bitter one'.
The outcome was the election of Mr.
Strong by a plurality of 47.187.
The administration of Mr. Strong was
an eventful one. Mr. Strong was avow
edly independent in bis views in city poli
tics. In the municipal campaign of 1S97,
which resulted in the return of Tammany
to power, he took the stump for Seth Low
as against General Benjamin F. Tracey,
the regular Republican candidate. After
this election he virtually retired from ac
tive politics, due to failing health.
It was announced at the residence to
night that the funeral arrangements had
not been completed, but would be made
public to-morrotr. â
Cornelius N. Bliss, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the American Pro
tective Tariff League, to-night announced
that a committee representing: the league
would be present at the funeral services
of the late ex-Mayor.

CqUrta here- for :--oine time. Am a result of
the decision Wiliitun i^. Marshall; editor
or the late Weekly Volcano, will probably
have to fferye six rronths at hard labor.
Marshall was Kerueneecl for 'criminal
libel on account of publications he made
about the late Chief Justice Judd. He
made an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Hawaii on technical grounds, alleging
methods pursued auring his trial mac
were not in uccoiaance wun American
procedure, 'lhe lower court was sustained
;<na Marshall turned with a writ 01 habeas
corpus to Judge Eatee.
Judgo Estee hold that the lawn of Ha
waii allowing conviction of defendants
upon A vermui. by nine jurors were stm m
force nt the time of Marsnall's trial, wnlcn
was long after the passage of the resolu
tion' anrexing Hawaii to the Union. The
Judge said that Hawaii before being an
nexed '"was a tree, enlightened state, pos
sessing all the attributes of sovereignty,
and when with Its consent the islands
were annexed by the United States aot
only the lands but the people with their
laws and customs were annexed; and. by
the well established law of nations these
Iaw3 end customs remained In force until
liew laws were enacted for' the govern
ment of the Territory." Estee held that
the people of Hawaii were regarded by
Congress as somewhat versed in the prin
cipk-s of self-government, so much so that
Congress waited tor nearly two years
after actual annexation before providing
a law for the government of tne Terri
tory.
Marshall's only recourse now is the Su
preme Court of the United States, but tie
has decided to serve out his pentence, and
the editor is now one of a gang of striped
convicts working on the public streets.
The question of whether the constitution
followed the flag to Hawaii is one which
many people would like to have decided
by the Supreme Court of the United
States. One of the Circuit Judges here,
taking a view opposed to that of Judge
Estee. has already released a prisoner who
was convicted of an infamous crime with
out a Grand Jury indictment, but the Cir
cuit Judge to whom Marshall's appeal
went held the other way. The result is
the release of one man and the conflrma-'
tion of the sentence of another, though
both appealed on exactly the saxne points.
Signer Marconi has sent to Hawaii a
new expert from London to investigate
the cause of the failure of his system
here.. The Hawaiian Wireless Telegraphy
Company cabled to London, stating that
the system would not work, and one of the
leading experts was at onc3 started to
Hawaii. The distances over which it is
necessary to send messages in connecting
the islands are not as great as have been
covered in Europe, and it is thought that
the new expert will be able to make the
system a success.

and Rev. E. H. Hayden of Santa Cruz ad

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 2.â The oc
cultatlon of Jupiter by the moon, a pne
nomehon which was observed by scientists
of Sydney, Australia, on October . 1, was
the. astronomical sensation of the year
there. The contact was very clear. The
edges of the moon and Jupiter were in line
and apparently touching, though millions
of miles separated them: The planet en
tirely disappeared a minute and a half
after the edges nrst came together.
Nothing more was seen until the edge
of the planet appeared on the bright side
of the moon like a small ball bulging from
the lunar orb. This was observed a little
over an hour, later. The last edge of the
planet broke away from the moon one
minute and eighteen seconds later.

ITS SHIPS WILL PUT
IN AT LOS ANGELES
New York - Hawaiian Company's
Agreement With the Jobbers of
.. the Southern California
. . Metropolis.
Sf*-rtal IMspateh to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 2.â The Los An
geles Jobbers" Association has induced the
New York-Hawaiian Steamship Company
to agree to have Its vessels touch at one
of the Los Angeles ports. There will be
i monthy service of these vessels from
New York around Cape Horn to Los An
geles, thence to San Francisco and the
Hawaiian Islands, and a. duplicate return
service.
Heretofore It has been necessary in
making shipments by the Pacific Mail
steamship line for Los Angeles merchants
to pay tne local tariff between Los An
geles and San Francisco, in addition to
the steamer tariff, with the exception of a
rate put into effect recently on westbound
frfignt. whereby there is a rebate of the
local railroad rate. But even under that
condition the San Francisco merchants
have had an advantage of several days In
the : receipt -of their goods. Under the new
arrangements Los Angeles will have every
advantage any other city has, and the
'freight rate will be .considerably under
that of the railroads,
: It has been the belief that the Pacific
Mail has kept out of Los Angeles through
pome agreement -with the Southern Pacilic
Railroad,: with which.it has : been .closel y
;alll<?d,. and the recent report that the
steamship line and the railroad are about
â¢to pass :Uhder. separate managements may
imply" that, the -- steamship .owners will
hereafter- consult their own interests
rather than the Interests of the railroad.
This.^ould be to the benefit of Los An
geles. â¢ ... '.' Â¦..Â¦.-....
AITSTB.AXIAN OFFICIALS
: ELUDED BY MURDERERS
Futile Chase After Maori Salfbreeds
\ Who Have; Committed Many*
, ' â¢â¢ ..'Â¦. Crimes.
; VANCOUVER. B. C, Nov. 2.â The Aus
tralian police have been baffled by the
Bee-long murderers. . Â¦. Seven months ago
the entire Colony was startled by a series
of murders which took place within one
hundred miles! of Sydney. Two well known
desperaioes, Jimmy and Joe Governor,
Maori halfbreeds, were the only ones of
the murderers who escaped from the
posse. Two families had been wiped out
of existence and their money taken. The
Governors were the ringleaders and got
away with most of the booty. Since that
time they have been driven from place to
place by the police, whom they stead
fastly defy.
â¢ The Governors have several times been
aided by Maori natives. On one occasion
they were sleeping in a barn when they
were surrounded by the officers. The
tarn was set on nre and the men then
fought their way out and got clear away,
leaving two dead policemen on the field.
Ten days later two sheep ranchers were
held up in bushranger style and all of
their possessions confiscated by the ban
dits. Two weeks later they killed a
woman.
Just before the Aorangi sailed for Van-
couver a proclamation was issued by the
Chief Justice of New South Wales declar
ing the men to be outlaws, so that they
m.'iy lepally be shot down If It is found
Impossible to capture them alive.

became involved In a drunken row while
eating in the restaurant. Words led to a
tussle, during which Winship shot Nar
vaez in the neck. Winship then paid hia
bill and walked coolly out of the restau

day. He admitted the shooting of Nar
vaez, but claimed to have acted in self
defense.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 2.â John Matthews,'
who is said to be the "black sheep" of a
rich and prominent Oakland family, is
wanted by the police on a charge of petty
larceny. For some time freight has been
stolen from cars at the broad-gauge
depot, and last night Robert Byers, the
watchman, caught Matthews In* the act-
He succeeded In making his escape, but
the watchman this morning swore to a
complaint in Justice Wallace's court.
Matthews Is a man of good education
and is said to have a monthly allowance
of $150. He has been a Heavy drinker,
and while intoxicated is a kleptomaniac.
For these reasons Matthews' family sent
him away from home and provided a
monthly competence for him. For some
time he has been in San Jose. Several
times he has been caught carrying away

he always pleaded kleptomania and made
restitution by paying for the goods. By
this mode he has escaped prosecution.

Erecial Disratch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA CRUZ. Xov. 2.^-Counsel for A.
K. Zlegler. who pursued his wife frcm
her home to the county road and cut he"
throat and afterward attempted? to kill
himself, are basing their hope of obtain
ing his freedom on the plea of insanity.
AH of the evidence introduced on behalf
of the defense Is in support of the con
tention that Ziegler is insane.
Paris Ziegler of Philadelphia, brother of
the defendant, in a deposition which was
read, declared â¢ that the defendant re
sembled his father and that his grand
father pa his father's side was Insane and
spent two years in an asylum. Two of hi-*
father's sisters, a brother and a ntece also
were Insane. Ziegler. In an affidavit, said
his. mother died in an Insane asylum, but
the deposition proved the contrary.
. William Beverly Sharp told o* having
heard Ziegler say that Mrs. Zlegler. by
finding his pistol, had saved a man's life.
Â¦ Mrs.. Armstrong was called to the' stand
by the defense. . Said she :
"I took, care of the house when Mrs.
Ziegler Was in 3an Francisco. At times
Zlegler would go through the house cry
ing 'Cad.. Cad.' and he seemed very much
worried â¢ and excited. I have seen Mr.
Zlegler walk up and down with a pistol
in his hands when not excited any moro
than usual. At times he would curse. I
don't know if he ever cursed when Mr.
Sharp was present." .-
She said she had. heard him say ha
would kill Mr. Sharp.
"I told him he didn't want to do any
thing of that kind. All this time he- was
very cool. On the night of the tragedy,
after calling Mr.. Sharp. I went out to the
front gate. When the JudsÂ© came in the
dining-room he said to me: 'Yes. I hava
done the. deed; she's lying down the road.
If you remain in the room I will cut my
throat before you.' ;Hj was very cooi
when he said this." '
Otto Buckow testified that at onÂ© time
he worked for Zlfffler and for two or threa
days at a time Ziegler would not speak a
word. Then he would suddenly become
very talkative.
Dr. J. F. Christal and Ehr. H. H. Clark
were questioned In regard to the condi
tion of Insane persons, with the object
of proving the insanity of Ztegler. Tha
case will be finished to-morrow.

MONTEREY. Nov. 2.-The abalona cannery

the factory Is 1500 cans.LUGUBRIOUS, lachrymose and wailing are the reports
that come from the college gridirons. At Berkeley this
man and that man is sent into the repair shops for
every variety of bruise and ossean injury; at Palo Alto
nine out of every ten canvas Jackets are suffering some
ailment. This la the period of injuries, one of the essentials
and attributes of the season. In another week the clouds will
pass away and then the elevens will be so Intent upon team
development that the cry of accidents will give way to the
absorption of hard work.
On the Palo Alto field this afternoon Reliance will meet
Stanford in their !ast engagement this season. Beginning with
next week the California universities will Inaugurate a Bertes
of games with teams representing the University of Oregon
and the University of Nevada.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY/, Nov. 2.â Work on the gridiron
has been light during the past week. With the completion of
their season's work most of the members of the victorious
freshman team have turned in their buRs for the year.
Among those of the first year men who have varsity prospects
are McFadden and Gregory, center; Bansbach, quarter, and
Stanford, halfback. Lunt, a promising candidate for varsity
end, was injured so severely in Saturday's game that he is out
of it for the season. M--'.'
The big team has been badly shaken to pieces by the in
juries of the past week. Fisher, probably the best running half
at Yost's disposal, was laid off a week ago in the alumni game
with a broken collarbone. Slaker is still nursing a pair of
crooked ribs and will not appear in his suit again till next
week. Geissler, another half who is exceptionally, clever with
his straight arm and fast with tho ball, went out of Wednes
day's practice with a displaced shoulder blade. Of the for
wards, De Forest and Traeger are both. wearing bandages, the
former on a sore arm and the latter on a weak ankle, but both
will be In Saturday's game. with Reliance. Raltt, who has been
off e week on account of a' severe flesh wound, will also play
his game at quarter. With so many, of the varsity men on-, the
injured list during the late practices it is to be expected that
the team work of the cardinal will be ragged for some time to
come. The coaches feel that the usual streak of injuries has
been passed and that the men will all be able to participate in
the Thanksgiving match, with the possible exception of Fisher.
The varsity will line up against Reliance on the local oval
next Saturday afternoon for Its last game with tho Oakland
Club men. Though the college team has already won the series
by winning the two previous games, a hard-fought match Is to
be expected. Stanford will line up as follows: Lee, center;
De Forest and Seeley, guards; Burnett and Traeger, tackles;
McFadden and Cooper, ends; Smith fend Allen, halves; Hill,
full: Raitt, quarter.
BERKELEY, Nov. 2.â With the training of the freshman
squad at an end, gridiron work has settled down Into Its final
stage of rounding out the varsity eleven for the big games to
come. On Wednesday California will play the San Jose Nor
mal, and interest is centered on this contest as being an ex
ceUent opportunity to mako comparisons with Stanford, which
has played the same team twice.
Coach Kelly has been drilling his eleven in offensive work
entirely, giving the varsity the ball and forcing It through the
second eleven for several touchdowns every night. This will be
relieved next week by practice In defensive work, and the
varsity will be taught to oppose and break up, the styles of play
now used by Stanford.
Heretofore the plays which Kelly has taught the Berkeley
boys have been of the simplestâ straight bucks, crossbucks and
end runs. Until this week nothing more complicated has been
attempted. Now the ends, tackles and guards have been all
tried in advancing the ball. The results have demonstrated
that in the line as well as among the backs California has sev
eral remarkable ground gainers. Protected by splendid inter
ference, Wcmble. Castlehun and Clay have been distinguishing
themselves of late in this, kind of work.
Serious hindrances to satisfactory practice have bÂ«en the
large and apparently growing list of Injured men and the weak
ness of the second eleven. Captain P.ringle and Freshman Cap
tain Starr, ,wbo were injured over two weeks ago. are recover
ing slowly.' It will be the middle of the month before either
can take his place on the varsity. Besides these other promis
ing players are temporarily on the shelf. Dunbar, Ramsaur.
Savage and Hudson are off the line and Whipple, Kaeding and'
Brune the backs. This loss of good, material and the need of
filling the empty places on the varsity squad with second eleven
men have left only a disorganized and unsatisfactory aggrega
tion to play against.

The Senators and the Germans meet
again. At Sacramento this afternoon the
nine consumers of pretzels and Irish stew
will hegiti a series of five games with the
champions, who will undoubtedly be the
champions of next year. Only a Galves
ton could upset , the statesmen's
hold on the pennant, and there is no team
in the league able to supply natural
forces. In sufficient quantity to do the
trick. It seems now that whichever way
the wind blows the Senators will rear
thHr heads above the melee beneath.
The clubs are situated In what will most
likely t>ft' their ulltmate order when the
season is over. The only race which may
change existing team positions is that
for second place,: San Francsico and
Stockton being- the contending teams. Of
late Stockton has be*>n playing a good
quality of ball, advancing step by step,
and at- the present critical stage a streak
of luck for the Millers may shoot their
team into second place before the season
comes to a clone.
It is an-undoubted fact that Sacramento
has easily the best aggregation of base
ball plavers in the league, and their pres
ent position is due to this fact. Luck, on
the other hand, figure? largely In the vic
tories of Stockton and San Francisco.
Oakland is aa it has been for two sea
sons â a ripe representative of the tail end.
Hughey Smith will not call balls and
strikes "safe" or "You're out" any more.
He resigned his position because players
and public showed a disposition to rebel
against bis lightest word. The great fault
with 8mlth was that he did not realize
the importance of his position and as
sume a dignity and positiveness which he
did not possess, whatever his decisions
were doubted he wanted to explain the
process of reasoning by which he reached
them. Then, again, as the small boy on
the bleachers shouted, "his windows
needed cleaning."
Last Sunday at Recreation grounds
Henry Harris committed a diamond sin
that should have cost him several sous.
His contention that the runners, who
scored while the , ground was being
cleared 'of small boys, who came upon
the field at the Invitation of the local
team, crossed the plate. legitimately, was
as puerile ae it was ridiculous. This
was another instance of Smith's pliant
vertebral Joints.
On the home grounds Stockton will
meet Oakland this afternoon. The teams
will line up:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. of
the report that the heavyweight battle
between James J. Corbett and "Kid" Mc-
Coy, fought in Madison Square Garden
last August, was a fake Is nowjurnlshed
by George F. Considlne. Corbel fa man
ager. It is contained in a letter addressed
to The Call and Herald by Mr. Considine
who obtained proof of the fraud from
McCoy whom he saw In London. In
order that he might clear himself of any
blame in the matter Mr. Considine hurried
back to New York and now makes pub
lic the facts In this letter, saying in
"I was in London and did not Intend
coming home for a couple of months but
I met 'Kid-McCoy in that city and to
my surprise was informed by him that he
had come over to England because of the
'downtown' people of New York, who ho
said, were Bore on him on account of' his
fight with Corbett. McCoy also made the
statement that the 'downtdwn' p eop i!
had never done anything for him, and
that he had a right to get money any
way he could. And he got money, he add
ed, by 'laying down' to Corbett, as ner
agreement. He also informed me that
nearly every one in New York believed
that I was in on the scheme. When he
told me this I was astonished and Im
mediately left London for New York
"Immediately on my arrival in New-
York, and before making any statement
I called on Corbett and accused him of
having a part In the fake fight This hi
denied, but I caught him In several ml"-
Btatements and I proved one of them
through witnesses present at the lnter-
Si e 7\Â»E e thon ad , ml Â«e<* that he knew
that McCoy was going to 'lay down ' and
I said to him: 'Why didn't -ou tell me of
it. instead of making a monkey of me?'
To which he replied: 'What for? so you
could tell Senator Tim Sullivan, who
would make McCoy fight on the leVel. aS
the Senator did in the Maher-McCov

was between "Kid" Goldle and "Kid"
Jciira. The latter had the advantage In
both height and reach. In the second
round Jones had it all his own way and

thoir man did not have a chance.

the third Murrey drove him all over the
ring. Murrey received the decision.
Joe Sullivan was scheduled to go four
rounds with Mike Ford. But toward the
close of the second round the pace was
too warm for Mike and he quit. Sullivan
made a very good impression with his
quick footwork and clean, hard punches.

Prieete cold in the end of the second
round of their contest. The blow that did
the trick could be heard "for a city
block." Prleste was the more scientific
of th^ two and the crowd was with him.
He dropped his hands for a second and
Young Sharkey landed a terrific blow on
the point of his chin. The aspirant for
pugilistic laurels went down and out and
lay on his back till his seconds picked
him up and took him to his corner.
Charley Ravanl and "Young Jeffries"
then wore announced. The most promi

eye that he received early in the came.
The eye swelled and swelled until the
optic threatened to burst. Ravanl cot the
decision in the second. Harry Bowers
bested Tom Bell in the second roundâ so
much so that the men in Bell's corner en
tered the ring and stopped the fight.
Jo?enh Ralph and Jack Sullivan fur

The only explanation that has thus far been given
of the selection is that Salisbury, while feeling him
self unable to act in the double capacity of Foreign
Minister and Prime Minister, has chosen to put in
the office from which he retires a man who will be
subservient and compliant to himself. Evidently
Salisbury does not wish another Chamberlain in his
Cabinet, nor has he any intention of giving more
authority to that ambitious statesman.
Whatever may be the explanation, the outlook is
certainly far from pleasing to the British public, and
possibly the denunciations which, have followed the
announcement of the choice may force Salisbury to
revoke it. In the present situation of affairs in China
land elsewhere Great Britain cannot afford to take
So overwhelming was the public condemnation of
Lansdowne that it was regarded as a sure thing that
in the reconstruction of the Ministry after the elec
tions he would be removed from the War Office. In
deed, during the campaign the Ministry had to assure
the public of that change in order to carry the elec
tions. Nothing helped Salisbury more than the an
nouncement that Roberts is to be made commander
in-chief and a new War Secretary appointed to co
operate with him in reforming the whole military
branch of the Government. That promise, it appears,
is to be kept in a way that will be almost worse than
breaking it. What will it profit the empire to remove
an incompetent man from control of the War Depart
ment and place him in control of the Foreign Office
at a time like this?
Lansdowne's administration ot the War Office has
been the cause of bitterness of spirit to the British
ever since the war in South Africa broke out. No
man in the Ministry has been subject to keener criti
cism in Parliament and out of it, and none more
thoroughly deserved it. Almost every department of
the War Office administration was found to be weak
and inefficient when the trial came. Most of the evils
flowing out of the bad administration were due to
sheer negligence, or possibly incompetence, but some
of them were of a nature that amounted to scandals.
The food furnished the troops was found at one time
to be as bad as the embalmed beef that aroused so
much condemnation in this country during the war
with Spain, and the wretched supplies furnished for
the hospital service created an indignation that stirred
the whole nation and led to a parliamentary inquiry.
SALISBURY'S selection of the Marquis of
Lansdowne to succeed him in the office of Sec
retary of State for Foreign Affairs has raised
a storm of -protest in Great Britain, and will be noted
with surprise in other countries. The complexities
and difficulties of international diplomacy were never
greater than at this time, nor did Britain ever have
more need of a strong, wise man in her Foreign
Office; and yet the Prime Minister, in the flush of
power newly given him by the people, selects for ap
pointment to tliat place in his Cabinet a man whose
record in the War Office shows him to be utterly in
capable of dealing properly with large affairs or acting
promptly in emergencies.

CAXIPORNIANS IN NEW YORK.
There is little wonder that Bryan handles the ice
trust with the tenderness of friendship. The warmth
with which the Democratic dispenser of hot air h
being attacked by uncomfortable questions makes it
reasonable that he should seek to retain some freezing
comfort.
As the statements of the Standard correspondent
were given a wide circulation it is but fair Mr. Davitt's
reply should have an equal notice. The issue is soma
thing more than a personal one between rival corre
spondents, and accordingly we have directed attention
to it in order to do justice to Davitt and remove from
the patriots of the Transvaal the stigma which he was
reported to have put upon them.
After further review of the course of the Standard
correspondent, Davitt concludes by saying: "I recol
lect with some little amusement now the fact that
while I was with the Boer forces I was repeatedly
threatened with summary punishment at the bayonet's
point or a Lee-Metford muzzle if I was once found
within convenient distance of such ministers of British
justice. Now, six months afterward, it is discovered
that I was 'disillusioned' by my experiences of Boer
fighting, and was really an opponent of President
Kruger all the time. I have the satisfaction of
knowing what the members of the Boer Government
think on the whole matter."
To this report as a whole Mr. Davitt has made de
nial in a letter to his paper. He denounces the cor
respondent of the Standard and says: "His characte/
for honorable journalism and his appreciation of Boer
lospitality may be gauged from the fact that he
stands alone, among all the correspondents, American,
English, Continental and Irish, who were with the
Boer forces, as the solitary libeler of their conduct and
actions, and malignant calumniator of the Govern
ment and people of whose hospitality he partook.
He was careful, of course, to conceal these views whHe
working with other correspondent. 1 ). They were re
served for expression when he was to go over to the
English side and bid farewell to the Mendlessohns and
Bruces, who could employ him no more in the jour
nalistic service of the Boer cause."
Furthermore, Mr. Davitt was reported to have said
by way of explaining his disillusionment that he had
seen the Boers abandon strong positions without
fighting, and that he was convinced: "Their purpose
is to prolong the business without seriously meaning
to fight, for the one object of heaping up bars of gold
they are taking from the mines and accumulating
them and hoarding them in obedience to the dictates
of that old man Paul Kruger,"
SOME days ago a dispatch from London pub
lished in The Call stated that the Pretoria cor
respondent of the London Standard had
in a communication to his paper thrown a
new light upon Michael Davitt's experiences in
the Transvaal. The dispatch went on to re
port the statements of the correspondent at some
length. In the report Mr. Davitt was quoted as hav
ing said to a friend: "I came out here at my own
expense. It has cost me I was full of enthu
siasm for these people. They knew my feelings, but
they never trusted me. To-day they refused to give
me information as to the situation for my papers, and
I go away broken and sick at heart. I am thoroughly
disillusioned."
MICHAEL DflVITT'S DENIAL.
The attention of the public is directed to thfs mat
ter because considerable numbers of intelligent citi
zens take so little interest in the details. of politics
that they are likely to make mistakes in preparing
their ballots. It is desirable to have every ballot
rightly prepared and fairly counted, and to that end
care must be taken to avoid the mistake which a lack
of explicit instruction upon the ballot itself renders
so liable to occur. ;
The one guide the voter has is to be found in the
fact that the names of candidates for each office are
arranged in columns under party designations. No
party has nominated more candidates than each voter
has a right to vote for. By noting the number in
each column nomin-ited for a particular office, such
as Superior Judge or Presidential Elector, the voter
can readily learn how many persons he is entitled to
vote for when he undertakes to make his selection
from the candidates of all the parties. By keeping
that fact in mind, errors may be avoided which would
have the effect of nullifying the entire ballot so far
as that office. is concerned.
An illustration of the evil effects likely to result
from the defect can be found in the contest for Su
perior Judge. There are to be elected four Judge*
for the full term and one for an unexpired term,
making five in all. For the full term there have been
nominated four Republicans, four Democrats, one
Prohibitionist, four Social Democrats and one Inde
pendent. For the unexpired term there have been
nominated one Republican, one Democrat, one
Social Democrat. The voter who does not care to
vote a straight party ballot is liable in selecting can
didates frotn these different tickets to vote for one
too many, thereby losing all his votes for that office.
The delect in the ballot is due to carelessness in
the amendment made in 1800. Formerly the law pro
vided that upon the official ballot "opposite the name
of each office there shall be printed a direction to the
voter specifying the number of persons to be voted
for for that office." No such provision now remains
in the law, and consequently the voter will find upon
his ballot when he enters the polling booth no instruc
tion or information upon that point.
I] PON the sample ballots sent out for the infor
\ I mation of voters the people will note that thib
* â year there has been omitted the instruction
given in former years as to the number of candidates
each voter is entitled to vote for. There is thus
danger that mistakes will be made, causing the vote
to lose his vote on some of the more important offices
at ftake. for if the voter marks more names than there
are persons to be elected to an office, or if for any
xeason it is impossible to determine, the voters' choice
for any office to be filled, his ballot will not . be
counted for such office.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
WE have referred to the digest of Australian
land laws, procured by the legislative commit
tee of the National Livestock Association.
Commenting upon the leasehold system Colonel
John F. Hobbs, editor of the National Provisioned
New York, says: "I spent six years in Australia, in
a position to know the feeling; of the pastoral tenants
and the conditions surrounding those dry grazing
areas. The acts of the Australian Parliament which
provide for and regulste the leasing of these grazing
lands are really formed after consultation with the
rangers and an investigation of the conditions of
these ranches. In fact, the various acts of Parliament
from time to time are but a series of improvement
stages in legislation which are suggested by the ex
perience of the pastoralists themselves, and are in
tended to perfect the system and the conditions of the
crown land lessees. In other words, the tenants of the
arid districts virtually made these laws to fit the graz
ing conditions as they found them, by coming in prac
tical contact with them. Free ranges in Australia
were the most unsatisfactory of all ranges. Under
the free range system 'cattle duffing.' outlawry, confu
sion and range-jumping were inevitable. The crown
tenant would prefer the freehold first, the leasehold
next and free range the last of all. With the lease
hold he has some protection for his stock and a
chance for himself. As a free ranger he is only a
prospector for some green-eyed competitor. The,
lease system has done more to develop the arid dis
tricts and build up the livestock industry of Australia
than was ever done by either the freehold system or
the old free range system, and that is the impartial
view of it."
Our own people will recognize in this an almost
exact analogy with conditions in this country.
The committee expects now to get from Texas a
complete statement of the effect of the leasehold sys
tem applied to the arid ranges of that State. It is
not without interest that the stockmen of Texas op
poscd leasing, but the State entered upon the policy
as a means of revenue. Now, with a few years' ex
perience in it, the stock men would oppose a return
to the free range more stoutly than they opposed th*
leasehold under which they have prospered. The bar
ren ranges have been restored. The forage is re
newed, aridity has decreased and the profits of the
stock men and of the State treasury have steadily in
creased.
It is worthy of note that Colonel Hobbs says the
Australian laws originated with the runholders them
selves. That must be the case here. Whenever the
stock men will agree upon an experimental statute we
have no doubt Congress will pass it. No one should
expect that it will be perfect, but it will be a begin
ning upon which a system may be built, as in Aus
tralia. If its adoption be left optional with counties,
as it should be, it will be an improvement on the Aus
tralian plan, for experiment in a few counties will test
the fitness of the law, and it may be more easily im
proved than if it were a blanket statute.
The Call hopes to see an aroused interest in this
subject. California is involved in its right adjustment.
I for it carries with it questions of irrigation of su
| pi erne importance to this State. 1

PERSONAL MENTION.
How anybody in this city can conscientiously . oppose
amendment No. 15 to be voted on at the coming election la^a d 'â¢^ a^., &e ot
to answer. There are merchants in the city who can and do takead* ante ge
the bankrupt law and the statute of limitations, but such dealers are not.ne
UP The^ptsed amendment seeks to correct a defect arising ftP-j^ggg. 1 "
of limitations. All those who In their private business would take^ "^iinV
of such limitation will of course carry out that policy in voting jsain. .
amendment No. 15. The public should in this matter be S"Â»<^d by . n^ S JSn
system that regulates their private business. No fair-dealing
would take advantage of a mere legal technicality in paying otf empioj es
who serve him faithfully. . . Mtn ~\ The
There is one phase of this question that is not generally understood. 1 ne
State law provides that schools shall be kept open a certain time ea.cn jear.
Failing to do this a school district is deprived of the State Â»PProprt*tion.
which in this city amounts to several hundred thousand dollars. Ha.a iÂ«
School Directors In 189S closed the public schools on account of the lac * " l
funds this city would have lost the entire State appropriation. The teacners.
therefore, were performing a double eei-vlce; they were doing their dut> in 1; ne
schools and at the B amÂ« time giving their time at risk of loss to. save, tnis
State appropriation. " . ' 'â¢
Had the Directors closed the schools and thus lost to this city the btate
appropriation, would they not have been liable on their bonds for neglect or
duty? And yet where the law compels under penalty the enforcement or a
public duty la it not reasonable to infer that It confers on the. cfilcial the
neceesary power to enforce the obligation? -V. .-'-â¢/.'Â¦ â¢ . :
When these items are taken into consideration it can be seen that failure
to meet the moral obligation brought about by the lack of funds would be re
pudiation pure and simple. No business man In thi? city with any reputation
would take this advantage in his private business. He could not afford to,
for he would be held up to the scorn of his business associates. If it is wrong
in private business. It is wrong in public. : ; *; :
Amendment No. 15 seeks to meet an honest obligation. It seeks to reTnedy
a confiscation which Is a violation of the Federal constitution; it aim3 at
clearing away the stain of repudiation of hone3t debt, and. everybody ghould
vote for it. W, W. STONE. Principal Burnett Primary. .

VIEWS OF A PRINCIPAL
ON AMENDMENT NO. 15
These are some of the reasons why Kansas will give
President McKinley n majority, and they are reasons
which affect the whole country. Bryan's campaign oi
deliberate misrepresentation this year is worthy only
to be set alongside his 1896 campaign for false
prophecies. He said then that if he were beaten and
the gold standard were affirmed prices would fall, a?
surely aÂ« a stone falls when cast into the air. and that
the schools would have to be closed, more men would
be idle, more men desperate and therefore more
crime! What man, for any justifiable reason, can
really want Bryan for President? A man is not a
statesman who fails in every forecast of the future and
who willfully misrepresents the present. Bryan is
guilty of both, and in that is sufficient evidence of hi?
utter unfitness for the Presidency or for any other
great public responsibility. â¢
A walking plow costs $1 more than in 1806. A rid
ing plow, then costing $55. is now $60. The Populist
press, following the false lead of Mr. Bryan, said it
took 40 per cent more Rrain to buy a plow now than
then!
Going to farm prices of stock in Kansas: Four
years ago hops were worth S2 60; this year $4 85.
Oats were then 8 cents: this year 20 cents. Coal oil
is the same price as in 1S96: coal in that country has
rot risen in price. The same amount of farm staples
now buys more lumber, more sugar, more merchan
dise of every description, pays more debts, and with
the great advantage in the comparati% r e rise in prices
enjoyed by farm produce the farm lands have risen
in value.
These wild statements set the farmers themselves
to figuring, and they found that a heating-stove which
co?t $74 in 1R06 costs only $15 now: a cook-stove
was $.}2 50 then and is $.35 now. Four years ago wheat
in Kansas was 44 cents. At the date of these calcula
tions this year it was 50 cents. Therefore four years
ago it took 3Xii bushels to buy a heating stove, this
year it took only 25^ bushels, saving the farmer
$3 fa. Four years ago the farm price of corn in Kan
sas was Ilj4 cents. This year it was 33 cents. At
the farm price it took 282 bushels of corn to buy a
conk-stove. This year it took only 113 bushels, sav
ing 160 bushels, worth $55 07.
Following Bryan's lead the Populist press of Kan
sas widely published the statement that this year it
lakes 50 per cent more wheat to buy a stove than in
1896. 20 per cent more corn to buy a wagon, twice as
much corn to buy a coil of rope, 40 per cent more
grain to buy a plow, and ion per cent more to buy
a copper kettle, and all farm machinery in the same
ratio.
In 1896 the Chicago price of corn was 22 cents a
bushel. The day he made his statement it was a frac
tion over 41 cents. Therefore in 1896 it took 284
bushels of corn to buy a wagon, and this year it took
170 bushels to buy the same wagon, saving to the
farmer 114 bushels of corn, worth $46 74. The num
ber of bushels of corn required to buy a wagon in 1896
was this year at that date worth $116 44, or within $8
of the price of two wagons at the figure of 1896.
\ A R. BRYAN has gone among farmers in the
/ \ grain belt to discontent them with their con
* * dition and stir them to a change by misrepre
senting comparative prices. In Kansas he told them
that, while the price of their product had advanced
somewhat, the rise in manufactured articles was so
much greater as to leave them worse off than in 1896.
Descending to details, he said that a trust had put up
the price of Studebakerfarm wagons so much that
it takes more bushels of corn to buy a farm wagon
now than four years ago. In 1806 the price of a
Studebakcr farm wagon in Kansas was $62 50. This
year it is $70, an advance of 12 per cent.

The Health and Hospital Committee of
the Hoard of Supervisors recommended
yesterday that the Board of Health be
directed to make an immediate and
searching Investigation of the allegations
contained In a report filed by Supervisor
d'Ancona that the milk furnished to the
patients In the City and County Hospital
is of poor quality and far below the
standard required by ordinance. D'Anco
na stated that ho had secured samples
of the milk in the patients' dining room
and in the wards and after sealing them
had submitted them to City Chemist
Green for analysis. The samples from
the dining room were taken In the even
ing, when the milk was placed on the
tables for supper. He had also taken
samples from the patients in the ward*
Just as they were about to drink the
mtlk out of cups. In every instance the
reports of the analysis made by tho
chemist show that the milk was deficient
In specific gravity, butter fat and solids
and greatly exceeded the maximum of
| water allowed by the standard.
A peculiar fact in connection with
D'Ancona's discovery w the fact that the
samples submitted to the chemist by the
attaches of the City and County Hospi
tal In the regular course of business were
found by Green to be above the standard
in one case and only slightly below in
another. D'Ancona ascribes this discrep
ancy In the two analyses to the fact that
the milk must have oeen adulterated in
the hospital Itself. He characterized the
proceeding as being an outrage if It were
carried on and desired Superintendent
Sussdorf to investigate the matter forth â¢
with.
Supervisor Braunhart objected to this
course on the ground that the Board of
Health was the proper body to make tho
Investigation and not a eubordinate.
D'Ancona agreed with Braunhart and it
was so ordered.
D'Ancona declared that the milk fur
nished to the patients was such that a
food Inspector would be justiiietl In
dumping it into the street shculd he dis
cover it on a passing wagon.
The ordinance regulating the purity of
milk requires that the article shall have
a specific gravity of not less than 10.20
per cent; butter fat not less than 3.2 per
cent; solids other than fat, 12 per cent;
water, not more than 88 per cent. The
ordinance does not fix the amount of
cream, but the standard Is recognized as
being 9 per cent. A comparison of the:**
figures and those for the samples fur
nished patients will show at a glance
wherein the latter are deficient.
The milk taken from the patients' din
ing room was ascertained by the chemist
to be very poor milk and far below tho
standard. The analypls showed Its spe
cific gravity to be 1.0237 vex cent; butter
fat. 1.4; solids not fat, 6.21; water, 92.39;
cream,, 4.
The milk from the workmen's dinlnj?
room showed the specific gravity to be
1.0206; butter fat, 1.4; solids not fat, 5.43;
water, 93.17: cream, 4. The milk served
to the patients In wards had a specific
gravity of 1.032S; butter fat. 2.3; solids not
fat, S.C6; water, 89.04; cream, 3. This was
designated as poor milk by ti.e chemist

POLICE GET
ANOTHER OF
DRUG THIEVES
Rounding Up the Men Who
Dave McKean, an ex-Convict and Cro-
Between for the Thieves,
Behind Prison
Bars.
Another member of the gang that has
been systematically robbing Mack &
Co., wholesale drugffists, Is locked up
In the tanks. His name Is Dave McKean.
He was arrested yesterday afternoon at
the Hall of Justice, while endeavoring to
get a permit to see Harry Geran, who Is
charged with the same offense. McKean
Is an ex-convlct. Some time ago he was
arrested for cracking a safe in a store on
Market street and sent to San Quentin for
two years and a half. He was paroled on
January 4, 189$, after having served a por
tion of his sentence. Prior to his arrest
and conviction he married Geran's
mother. In addition to being the "go be
tween" for the gang, McKean lg strongly
suspected by the detectives of being the
safe cracker who has been operating In
this city during the past month.
Shortly after t o'clock yesterday after
noon McKean and his wife visited the of
fice of the Chief of Police and asked for
a permit to see Oeran.
"This Is the boy's mother," remarked
McKean, pointing to his wife; "she wants
to see him."
Recognizing him as the ex-convlct for
whom ne had been looking in connection
with the wholesale looting of Mack &
Co.'e store. Detective Gibson, who was
present, asked him his name.
"Aly name is Williams.' 1 carelessly re
marked tho man. "I guess you don't want
me."
"Yes I do," laughingly remarked the de
tective; "come with me."
Gibson then slipped his handcuffs on Me-
Kean's wrists and escorted him to the
City Prison, where he was locked up In
the tanks. McKean, so the police say,
assisted "Ike" Muller In disposing of the
drugs and chemicals stolen from Mack &
Co. They claim that Muller, after re
ceiving the stuff, would give It to Mc-
Kean to sell. After Muller left the city
to avoid arrest McKean. It Is claimed,
entered Into a compact with the men who
were robbing: Mack & Co., whereby
he was to handle all the property stolen
from the drugKl'ts. Several days ago the
detectives learrefi that McKean had dis
posed of a quantity of cocaine, and after
satisfying themselves that It had been
stolen from Mack & Co., they de
cided to arrest him. They visited his
house, expecting to- find him home, but
were told that he was out of the city.
McKean evidently Intended to ''run a
bluff" on the detectives by going to po
lice headquarters, never thinking that he
would be arrested.
After being taken to the City Prison ha
tried to destroy a letter, which is sup
posed to have been sent him by Muller.
but was prevented. The police refuse to
disclose the contents of the letter. Mul
ler, It Is reported, is now on his way ta
Salt Lake from Oregon, and word has
been sent to the Chief of Police of that
city to nrrest htm.
It Is now estimated that the gang has
succeeded In getting away with over $10.
000 worth of drugs and chemicals belong 1
Ing to the drug company.
Drs. Ralph Addlson Huntingdon and J.
D. Hill, charged with the murder of Miss
Jennie McKown, were Instructed and ar
raigned In Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day. Dr. Huntlngton was represented by
ex-Judge Ferral and Dr. Hill by Attor
ney John Flournoy. Both defendants ap
peared ' to feel the responsibility resting
on them and were nervous and excited.
When the case was called ex-Judge Fer
ral said that Mrs. Belle MeCottrey, the
dead girl's sister. In swearing to the
complaint charging the defendants with
murder had unwittingly perjured herself,
as she was not personally conversant
with the facts. It was a dangerous prac
tice and Captain Seymour, who had ad
vised her to do bo, knew that It was
wrong. Captain Seymour, who was In
court, smiled.
Ex-Judge Ferral contended that the
charge could not be more than murder
in the second depree, as there was an en
tire absence of malice or premeditation.
The Supreme Court so decided In tho
case of ex pRrte Wolfe in 18S0. He asked
that the defendants should be admitted to
bail.
The Judge said he had nothing to do
with the swearing of the complaint. His
duty was simply to see that the facts al
leged In the complaint were verified and
the complaint was signed. He assumed
that all the facts were elicted In the
warrant clerk's office before the com
plaint waa Issued. Ho agreed with ex-
Judpe Ferral that the charge could only
be murder In the second desree, but It
was not within his province to order a
new complaint to be drawn up and
signed. As to the matter of ball ha would
consider it and give his decision in tho
afternoon. The preliminary examination,
was 6et by consent for November 8.
At 2 o'clock the attorneys were present
In court and the Judge said he had de
cided, after reading over the testimony
given at the Coroner's inquest, to admit
the defendants to bail. As Dr. Hill was
not as sprjously Involved as Dr. Hunting
ton he would fix his bonds at $5000 and
I>r. Huntlngton's at $10,^00. Hill was soon
released from prison. Joseph Rosenberg
and A. Hermann, brokers, qualifying on
his bond, being the same sureties who
were on his bond when he was released
last Tuesday by order of Judjje Fritz.
Ex-Judge Ferral did not expect to have
Huntlngton's bonds ready till this morn-
Ing, as one of the sureties lived In Oak
land.
Judge Cabaniss Instructs and Ar
raigns Defendants and the Casa
Is Ordered Continued Un
til Next Thursday.
One Secures Bail and Lib
erty and One Is Still

418 South Spring St., Los Angeles, CaLThere was four or five degrees south of the
equator a group of Islands that Magellan bad
taken possession of in the name of Phillip of
Spain, over which Spain had governed; and
there was a fleet. No one knew Its strength
and no one Its capacity, but It was said to be
fully equal to our Asiatic squadron. The har
bor of Manila was said to be sown with tor
pedoes and the shores were lined with forts,
and the world looked on In amazement when
Dewey was told by the President of the United
States not to capture the Philippines, but to
find that fleet and put it under water, and ha
went, and Dewey's work was accomplished.
(Great cheering.) Is there any Democrat this
side of the bottomless pit who condemns him
for that? What was the result? What was
our situation before the civilized world? What
was the duty of this Government? We knew
then lens than we know to-day. What were
we to do with It? Nothing but what our Pres
ident has done. Nothing but what our Gov
ernment has decided and carried out. It was
at best a graceless task. It was one that we
might wish to have been spared, but when
the duty was made apparent the American na
tion was ready for It and It has been there
ever since and will stay there. (Great ap
plause.)

McKinley Was a Soldier.
But there was no other alternative. McKin
ley, who was a soldier by profession and not by
name (laughter and applause), although he
entered the army as a common soldier, with
his musket on his shoulder, had been raised to
a superior command, who knew what war
meant, who knew what war was. hesitated to
Involve the country Into a war In Us condition
of finances and dreaded the loss of life. He
went Into that war with a sterner sense of
duty than the President of the- United States.
He summoned h!s array as Lincoln summoned
his. He summoned It from the body of the
people. AnÂ«l our army went down to Cuba and
our battleships went around that Island seek
ing to discover Cervera while he was making
his second discovery of America. (Laughter.;

moment burst asunder the beautiful ship, that
white dove of peace that floated In those murky
waters, and sent 262 sailors and marines, safe
as they supposed they were under the protec

bar; their souls to the bosom of God. ThÂ»
people did net stop to consider whether It was
an act of Spain or the local government of
Cuba. I firmly believe as I do In your ex
istence here to-night that that act, that das
tardly and cowardly destruction of human
lives, was the work of the local Spanish Gov
ernment in the Island of Cuba (cheeTS). and
sooner or later the murder will out. Sooner or
later, when the rusty bones shall be lifted from
the waters, the story as to whether it was an
Internal or external violence will be settled for
ever.

W. A. Morris of Stanford spoke briefly
In favor of the Stanford University con
stitutional amendment, explaining its pur
poses and pleading Its necessity. Taking:
up the Issues of the campaign he said in
part:
Good Government for Filipinos.
What were we doing at the beginning of this
century? Engaging ourselves In a great strug
gle for liberty. What do we see In the middle
of the century? Another struggle for liberty.
And now at the close of this greatest of centu
rle* we stand extending the arm of liberty over
oppression as base as that which we ourselves
endured In the beginning. And the Republican
party stands now. as it always has stood, the
exponent of this liberty.
This campaign is not a thing of the hour,
but a struggle of four years' duration. On the
one hand we have had actions and not words;
on the other hand words and not action. On
the one hand we have seen our state affairs
administered in a manner that should call forth
a mighty shout of commendation from every
loyal American. On the other hand we have
Il6tt*n^<l for over four y&&.wi to cl voicfr from
the wilderness, from the mountain, even from
the rear end of the Ice wagon, prophesying
great evil If we do not Immediately or at some
time or other change our financial system, our
executive system, our administrative system.
Thin nation will not stand as the exponent of
conservatism. Its motto Is progress. Let us
build up our manufactories; let us extend our
commerce; let us Increase our products and our
manufactories until they not only satisfy every
demand at home but until they reach Into every
port In the world; let us extend our schools;
let us etart all of our mill wheels to turning
and keep that dinner pall full to overflowing:.
And finally, let us extend our territory and the
protection of our flag wherever the name of
liberty and humanity demand*.
E Myron Wolf, chairman of the e\-on
ing was late and John T. Nourse, presi
dent of the McKinley and Roosevelt Club
of Stanford University called the meeting
to order and Introduced the first speaker.
J S. Butler of the University of Califor
nia, who spoke in part as follows:
Actions Versus Words.
THE spirit of the Republican rally
at Metropolitan Temple last
night was at once earnest,
thoughtful and enthusiastic
Apathy, indecision, non-appreci
ation of the vital character of the ques
tions Involved had no place in tho minds
of the auditors, and yet there was little of
the blEre and cheap enthusiasm of the or
dinary political round-up.
Six college boys from the Republican
clubs of the University of California and
Stanford made speeches full of the meat
of argument. A quartet from Stanford
sang campaign songs to tuneful college
airs. University people were In evidence
throughout the gTeat audience, which
filled every nook of the temple. The rally
was the culmination of the Republican
campaign and the greatest demonstration
that San Francisco has had during this
contest of the parties.
General \V. H. L. Barnes made the prin
cipal address of the evening, speaking
after the young men had had their say.
For an hour the auditors sat entranced
by his eloquence, and there was not a soul
among them but was sorry when tho last
of the silvery words of the peroration had
been said.
And that's the true situation. Four years
ago the Democrats predicted disaster, destruc
tion, distress. After four years of McKinley
ism our manufactures are Increased, our com
merce improved, our standing among the na
tions of the earth second to none. Truly, things
don't happen to be "as they used to wui." And
the result? Well, "their head-wheels whirl
with a busy buzz." With that busy buzz that
has found Its expression In the Oemocratlo
platform; that busy buzz that sees nothing good
In all that has happened to enhance our pros
perity and Insure our future; that busy buzz
that would unseat the guardian of our honor â
William McKinley.
Record Sound on Trusts.
R. P. Cross of Stanford University was
introduced to speak on the trust ques
tion. He said in part:
The choice of President on November 6 will
be of vital Importance, not only to the coun
try at large, but to you Individually. Unwise
legislation In regard to large corporations may
result disastrously to Industry. Tariff legis
lation unfriendly to the American system may
bring untold misery. Unsound financial meas
ures may result In national discredit.
W. B. Greeley of the University of Call-
The Democrats expect us to make believe that
we do not see the real Issue of tho campaign.
But we do see It. we know that It Is not Impe
rialism. It's the monetary question, the ques
tion of free silver; it's the tariff question, the
question of free trade; It's tha personal ques
tion, the question of the roen. The Democratic
situation reminds of a little couplet I heard re
cently. It ran:
"My head wheels whirl with a busy buzz, â¢
'Cause things don't be aa they used to wui."
The American laborer by his prosperous con
dition Is a living refutation of the Democratlo
claim that mere combinations In themselves
are detrimental to his welfare. Kor during the
last four years he has witnessed no recurrence
of the horrible spectacles witnessed under the
Democratic administration. They have been
four years of prosperity, in which the poor
American laborer has had nothing to do but
work, nothing to eat but food and nothing to
Epend but money.
Jesse H. Stelnhart of tho University of
California spoke In part as follows:
Real Issues of Campaign.
The Stanford Republican quartet sanff
a campaign song and responded to an
enthusiastic encore.
E. Myron Wolf, having arrived, was
Introduced and spoke briefly, as follows:
The Republican college clubs have done their
work well. They were first organized by Gen
eral Cark!<on. who observed that college pro
fessors were enamored of free trade doctrine
and to give the colleges a view of the practical
side of the question he began the organization
of the college clubs.
The future of the country depends on the
young men and It Is well to teach them the
duty they owe to the community and to the
State. Next Tuesday you will see an almost
unanimous column of college students and col
lege professors marching with the great army
that shall decree that the policy of American
progress shall be upheld, that the American
flag shall not be hauled down.
College Men for McKinley.
convey the Impression that one party Is ar
rayed on the side of empire and the other try
ing to strike the shackles from an oppressed
p*-cple. Does this attempt square with the
facts? Mr. Bryan desires to establish a stable
government in the Philippines. That is exactly
what the administration is trying to do. striv
ing rnoet earnestly to do. Our commission
there, with a Berkeley professor on it, I am
proud to say. Is trying to give the Filipinos
the best government, most nearly self-govern
ment, that Is possible under the conditions.
Mr. McKinley came to power under most
adverse conditions. The state of the country
was one of great unrest: there was general
uneasiness among the laboring classes of the
country. Work was hard to find. Many men
had become poor who never knew the sign of
want before, and his mind was not upon con
quest or imperialism but upon the restoration
of the finances of the country â the lighting up
of the fires that had been put out â the fur
nishing to Intelligent labor the means and ca
pacity by which to live.
Tho sufferings Inflicted on the people of Cuba
What "Workingmen Wanted.
Follow It, follow thle great party, young
men. But see how It tools hold of the dis
ordered finances of a grreat people and out of
It wrought stable government, commercial
honor, credit abroad and fidelity to Its en
gagements at home. See how It made liberty a
household word all over the land: see how
each Presidential term, so long as Republicans
were at the helm, the nation grew and
strengthened; eee how when Mr. Cleveland
came into power the blight again came to it.
From dread and poverty and disaster, the
nation unable to collect enough revenue to pay,
and he went out of power, having borrowed
two hundred and sixty millions of dollars to
pay the everj'-day expenses of the country.
What has happened since? I ask myself this
aa a young student of history. (Laughter.)
What has occurred during the last four years T
This magnificent panorama, of which Ita cen
tral sun Is McKinley here to-night. Why fol
low In the lead of the Ton* of the revolution;
of the enemy of his country of 1S12; of the
man who regretted the acquisition of Louisi
ana, who opposed the annexing: of Florida and
of Alaska? There have been drags upon the
chariot wheels of our progress from the Tory
to Bryan. And they served their party In his
tory. They are not altogether without use
fulness. They have their purposes because they
make us stop and think. A campaign like that
through which the American people has passed
thle year has been productive of more solemn
thought than any since the campaign that
preceded the election of Abraham Lincoln as
President of the United States.
Advice to Young Men.
He came to his station at Washington through
a Democratic city by night, lest they might
tnke his life. He entered upon his duty with
the bulk of the Democratic party In favor of
disunion, and then began for the first time
what the Democrats objected to then and now
âgovernment without the consent of the gov
erned. It cost *3. 000. 000. 000; it cost 1.000.000
lives, but at last the governed learned that the
best way to do was to consent to be governed.
Vet through all that trouble how did they talk
cf Abraham Lincoln? (Tremendous applause
and cheering.) He was a tyrant who was try-
Ing to Impose his power upon the people of the
Liilted States. Worse than that, they likened
him unto the animals of the dense forests of
Africa. He was a gorilla, an ape â a human
monsterâ and at last one of them murdered
him. And his sublime soul mounted to thÂ«
presence of the God that created and loved
him, and he reposes there upon that infinite
breast. Immortal there as he is and ever shall
bo Immortally glorious In the hearts and lives
or the American people. (Applause.)
Lincoln Had Enemies.
blrth of the Republican party there would be
no doubt what I would do. The Republican
party came to life. It seemed. In a twinkling
of an eye. It was not so. It was not of sudden
birth it was years of response to the doml
rcting side of public life. When Mr. Buchanan
left office he left a shattered nation, a ruined
credit; he left a country shorn of everything:
at home and abroad, and out of the darkness
came a man whose sublime image will never
be forgotten: that man from Illinois, from
whom to-day these Democrats steal as they
would steal the livery of heaven to serve the
devil. (Applause.)
Dut now It seems to me as though there was
a great army of the young marching toward
the higher education. We did not eee In those
days â yes. we" did see the bonnets that came
on the green (laughter), but they had nothing
to do with our course of study as laid down in
the curriculum Maughter). but to-day the high

women alike (applause). I do not know â I
have never beÂ£n able to understand why It
wan that the higher education has been so
many centurleR denied to woman. How one

Higher Education.
It was not so In my time as a college stu
dent. I do not remember tha event of tho re
versible cape. We had no capes at all to re
verse ; we had little or nothing to do with
practical politics or the matters that interested
the public on either side. We were bound down
to a curriculum of study that taught us some
thing of L>atln, Eorocthlng; of tha higher litera
ture, and when we got out of college we were
about as fit for the practical comforts of hu
man life as we were when we left our mother's
breasts. The higher education was so htÂ«h at
that time that It was reached by very few. A
college class even in the great universities of
Harvard and of Tale, which were then as they
are now the two great universities of the coun
tryâthey knew nothing: whatever of practical
politics, and It was a rare thing to see a fresh
man class that exceeded thirty or forty; ISO to
200 students was a large body of young men
and 200 or 400 would Include all those engaged
In the advanced studies of the law, theology
and medicine.

I fail to see why the Democratlo party ehould
attract to Its ranks any of the young men
of the country.
Its present is made up of financial and politi
cal heresies. Ita future is a void Into which
the eye cannot pierce.
The Democratic party for four years has been
trying to create an issue. They looked out to
the Orient and thought they saw a cloud gath
ering, but it proved to bo only the breaking
of a new dawn. So they have rather dropped
Imperialism of late and have turned their chief
attention to the monstrous trusts. Think of
that, the Democratic party posing as the enemy
of the trusts!

the Spanish war. The wisdom of America Is

YOUNTVILLE, Nov. 2.-The most en

held here this evening. P. Bradley pre
sided. General E. S. Salomon was the
speaker of the evening. He delivered a
stirring speech. Cheers went up from the
old veterans, and as he. pictured their sol
dier life and showed them how and why
they ought to be with the Republican
party and for McKinley and Roosevelt,
his words were greeted with storms of
applause. He told the "Mexican war vet

Salomon Talks to Veterans.
A LARGE and enthusiastic
meeting of Democrats was
held last nJght In Odd Fel
lows' Hall. The remarks of
the various speakers were all
greeted with /hearty applause, and tho
audience yelled and stamped vociferously
at the mention of the names of the Dem
ocratic standard bearers.
The meeting was opened by Allison
Ware, who in a few well-chosen words
Introduced Charles Wesley Reed as chair
man of the evening.
Mr. Reed in his opening remarks ex
plained to the audience that although he
supported McKinley four years ago he
enrolled himself in this campaign as a
Democrat. He reviewed the events of
the etlrrinsr times of 1776. likening the
present condition of affairs to the state
of the American colonies at that time.
As chairman Mr. Reed then introduced
J. Nunan Phillips, the Los Angeles ora
tor and Silver Republican, who Bald In
part:
"I am thankful to be able to state from
t+iis platform to-night that I come from
the south with glad tidings for the
friends of Bryan and Stevenson. For
forty days and nights I have traveled
this State, and I see everywhere evidences
of the overwhelming strength of tho Dem
ocratic forces."
Â¦ Continuing, the speaker discussed the
recent decision of M. M. Estee in regard
to the Mongolians and Japfi In Hawaii,
which he stated "opened the doors of
this country to an undesirable element."
Mr. -Phillips also spoke of the Webster
Davis episode, decrying against the
charge of bribery made against "the
grand old man." who, in the opinion of
the orator, "was of too noble a make to
barter himself for gold." The balance
of his oration was mainly a repetition of
figures and statistics tending to prove the
falsity of the present. administration.
Following Mr. Phillips Miss Etta Welsh
was Introduced and amused the audience
by singing campaign songs. The young
lady was recalled time and again.
The appearance of Judge Lawlor upon
The meeting closed with an oration by
Joseph J. Dwyer. The speaker advocated
the policy of the Democratic party as ex
emplified by Bryan and decried the for
mation of an .unusual number of trusts
during the last administration His re
marks on the Philippine question were
strongly uttered and appealed greatly to
the audience, which received them with
cheers.

Ing "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the

the stage was the signal for loud cheer-
Ing and vigorous handclapping. The Judge
did not speak, as It was not a local meet
ing.
L. L. Loofburrow of Stanford Univer
sity was next Introduced. He spoke of
the amendment which means bo much to
the Institution and made plain the mean
ing of the proposed amendment-. "Tho
primary object of tha amendment," said
Mr. Loofburrow. "is to place the institu
tion in a position to receive future endow
ments. There are at least two gentle
men who would will to the Stanford Uni
versity the major portion of their for
tunes if the State law would permit.
Many persons are of the opinion that the
removal of the taxes applies to^the en
tire. Stanford estate. In this they are
mistaken. The taxes we desire removed
are only those levied upon the buildings
of the university and the ground upon
which they stand."

money is expended for the wages of work

For example, each of the two leading po
litical parties has placed in nomination
five candidates for Superior Judges. The
Prohibitionists; have one nominee. There
is.one independent candidateâ George H.
Bahrsâ and the Social Democrats present
a complete ticket of five names. The
Â¦voter .In .selecting 'five -from the several
columns of party desigmation may stamp
aÂ£a X to, the riphr of six names. There
would be but s=lff?ht. ganger of making a
mlstticft If the voter should blindly decide
to cast his ballot straight for all the
nom-inees on any onÂ© of the political par
ties. â¢ But as the majority of voters will
exercise their intelligence and honest
judgment as to the fitness of candidates
for Judicial positions selections will be
made from two or more than two col
umns of the official ballot. There is dan
ger that ' the X may be stamped to the
right of six. ir-stead of only five names.
In that case the ballot, so far as It related
to the Superior Judges, would be In-
Volld. It is an open question as to
whether election officers would not hold
the ballot invalid as to all candidates
thereon, in event of this error being com
mitted.
The ballots l<> be cast at Â¦ the "election
next Tc*sday : "ilo not contain instruction
to the voter as to the number of candi
dates to be voted for; hence electors must
take especial care in stamping the ballot,
lest too many ' candidates be voted for.
Section 1127 of the Political Code, enacted
in' IS93. provided that directions to the
voters as to" the nurnber of candidates to
t>.e' voted for should be printed on each
l=ra.ilot. In JS93, when the law was amend

fornla was the next speaker. He said In
part:
The American people, are not wont to put
their hands to the plow and look back. When
once we undertake a thing:, we see it through.
When a righteous war has laid unexpected and
unsought responsibilities upon our shoulders, it
Ik not for us to shake them off in craven fear
and try to satisfy ourselves and the world
with some miserable, half-hearted makeshift.
What the Filipinos need at this critical time
is direction and guidance. They must be shown
how. This Imperative need President McKinley
and his able corps of co-workers are supplying
to-day. He has called to his aid the learned
educators, the trained jurists, the statesmen of
the country. He has sent over a Civil Com
mlEslon which Is developing and putting Into
operation a system of local self-government.
It is a splendid sign, fellow citizens, that
these young men are carefully considering
what shall be their political status. Certainly
nothing could be more Important than that a
young man In this, as In every relation of life,
shculd start right. I wish I were young again.
If I could only gret back to those glorious days
when life was like a pillow of fire, but now
its cloudy mantle covers me. I know what I
VGUld have done in respect to my political
duty. If I went back any further than tha
ten more stories and novels and has pierced
tha heavens with tho telescope of astronomy.

The Exact Speech.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2.â Herewith la
given a literal translation of a document
printed In the Spanish language and cir
culated In the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict by the agent3 of \V. H. Graves, the
Democratic nominee for Congress in that
district. Following the translation is a
report of Representative iIcLachan'3
speech in Congress on the subject referred
to In the circular. The report of hi,*
speech, delivered on February :Â». 1SCS. is
taken from page 2334 Congressional Rec
ord, first session of the Fifty-fourth Cbn
gTess. This Is Graves' document:
Spanish-American voters, attention: All
faithful Spanish-Americans are requested to
take notice of the following when they coma
to vote for a member of Congress at thÂ« elec
tion of the Â«th of November:
The Republican nominee, James McLachlan,
was in Congress before and in 1838. Uhile a
member thertof he was noted only for his op
position and hatred to anything that had even
a distant association* with the Catholic church.
He was. and is yet. a member of tha bated A.
P. A., and all Catholics ought to vote against
him and in favor of Hon. W. H. Graves, who
Is of our own race and blood and a faithful
son of the holy Catholic church.
Here is a copy of one ot the speeches ma'ln
by Mr. McLachlan while he was a member of
Congress, in which he showed a portion of thÂ»
hatred which be feels for our people and
church. Read with attention:
"Mr. Llntonâ I yield to tho gentleman from
California.
"Mr. McLachlanâ Mr. President, when th*
appropriation bill was presented to Congress
for debate I was surprised to know that this
Government made so large appropriations to
the institutions managed by the Catholio
church. I voted to strike from the bill every
appropriation to an institution of this kind
whatsoever, believing: help of this kind odious
and hateful In principle.
"I have now the satisfaction of knowing that
I acted then not only according to my con
viction of right, but that I have, the approval
of my political associates In so doing. For
the same reason that I opposed that bill. I am
opposed to the provisions of this bill as re
ported by the committee on Indian Affairs, ap
propriating more than $210,000 to the Ir.d'.in
schools under the direction and government of
tha Catholic denomination, and am in favor of
the amendment ot the gentlemen frosi Mich
igan directing that this money should be spent
by the Government In its own schools for tha
education of these Indian children, and that
these children be taken from the care and bane
ful Influence of the Catholic church.
"To make the appropriation recommended by
the committee would, in my Judgment, be an
unwarranted disposition of the public funds.
a cross violation of the constitution and op
posed to the principles of our government. ThÂ«
pages of history are blaclc with the results of
such legislation as this bill proposes and tha
same pages are full of warning to all nations
of the earth to avoid all legislation for thÂ«
special benefit of the Catholic church.
'â¢My ancestors, centuries ago, gavÂ» up their
lives among the hills of old Scotland, fight
ing against the Catholic church, and their
descendants have not ceased to this hoÂ«r op
poslrg this organization. I. a descendant of
that race, with the- right of being heard In
this lawmaklng assembly of ths greatest Gov
ernment that man has conceived, cannot re
sist raising my voice in protest against the
un-American legislation proposed by this" bill
coming from the committee, and ask my fel
low citizens to support ths truly American
amendment proposed by the gentleman from
Michigan."
â¢ Thua it was that hÂ» robbed thÂ« schools, con
ducted and supported by the Catholic chureh.
out of thÂ« money that they needed and had *
right to have for their advancement and tha
schools bad to cease, and thousands of poor
children had to go without an education, or
even food and clothing, because they had been
robbed by this man who now asks you to vota
for him again. Tou should com* to the polls
to vote, not for this man. but for your friend
and countryman, Mr. Graves.
The following- Is the exact speech de
livered by Mr. McLachlan In Congress on
the 24th day of February, 1S96, when the
Indian bill was under consideration In tho
House, as reported In the Congressional
Record of the first session of the Fifty
fourth Congress, on page 2334: . v :
Mr. Chairman: When the dlitrlct appro
priation bill was before the House the other day
for discussion I was surprised to learn that
this Government had been In the> habit of mak
ing- large appropriations to Institutions con
trolled by various sectarian denominations, I
voted then to strike from the bill every appro
priation to a sectarian Institution of any kind,
including one to a Protestant denomination of
which I have the honor of being a member.
I have the satisfaction of knowing now that
I acted then not only according to rriy own con
victions of right, but that I have the approval
of my constituents in so doing.
For the same reason that I opposed that' bill
I am opposed to the provisions of this bill as
reported by the Committee- on Indian Affairs.

dollars to the Indian schools under the special

A JOINT rally of thÂ« Iroquols
Club and of thÂ© Thirty-ninth
District Bryan and Stevenson
Club was held In Saratoga
Hall last nlsht. There was a
fair audience present and thÂ© various
speakers were listened to attentively. The
chief candidate to address the audience
â¢was Porter Ashe, who told of what he
Â¦would accomplish If elected to Congreas
and of the work he was accomplishing
In his canvass of the city.
"So far as I am able to 'udgre," he
said, "the sentiment of the city seems to
be on my Bide. I have bee., working
very hard during this campaign and feel
that I deserve the office for which I axn
a candidate. It will be unnecessary for
me to enlarge on the national Issues.
Suffice It to say that so far as San Frau
clsco Is concerned It will be my honor
and pleasure If elected to spare no effort
In my duties for the benefit ot my con
stituents."
Mr. Ashe's greatest hit was scored
when, pointing to the red tie he wore, he
tbld his audience that they could see by
that that he was to address an audience
of Italian voters.
After the conclusion of Ashe's speech
the audience rose to go almost en masse
and for a few moments It looked as If
empty benches might drink lu the ora
tory of the other candidates who were
announced to speak. Chairman McMann,
however, wielded his gavel vigorously
and managed to stay and hold a portion
of the exodus.
Louis H. Ward then addressed the audi
ence on the Importance of sending a
young man to the Assembly. J. J. Dyer,
S. V.-Costello, W. P. Lawlor. J. T. O'Con
nor and other candidates also spoke.

POETS OF HUMOR AND
SOCIETY HIS SUBJECT
Professor Charles Mills Grayley Lec
tures to Channing- Auxiliary on
Minor Versifiers.
Professor Charles Mills Gayley delivered
the fourth of his series of lectures on
"Debatable Questions In Poetry" before
the Channing Auxiliary in the parlors of
the First Unitarian Church yesterday aft
ernoon.
The subject was "Some Poets of Humor
and Society," illustrated with selections
from each. Among those whom Professor
Gayley selected as the best examples of
his topic were Praed. Edward FitzGerald.
Andrew Lang, Lockyer, Lawson and Aus
tin Dobson, the latter being titled the
laureate of society verse writers.
Of poets purely humorous the lecturer
cited Horace and James Smith. Canning,
the editor of the early century " i AntI-
Jacobin." and Charles Stuart Calverly,
who, said the lecturer, was the prince of
parodists and one of Oxford's most bril
liant scholars.
Hood the lecturer declared to be too
grim a satirist to be pleasantly humorous,
and read from his "Ballad of May" to il
lustrate his point. At the general request
of the audience Professor Gayley also
read a few verses of Kipling's humorous
ballads.

Directors Have Trouble Re^
garding Removal of
Â¦ j Garbage/ ;
DISMISSAL
OF JANITORS BY
SCHOOL BOARD
Charles II lives in English history a3
the "merry monarch." During all his
reign, hilarity and unrestrained revelry
held possession of the kingdom. He was
the wittiest of all English sovereigns. Gay
and careless in temperament, fond of
pleasure, quick of intuition. Instant in
repartee, he was more Celtic than Teu
tonic, and to add to his native bent hid
early training had been in France under
"an absolute monarchy tempered by good
sayings." His advent Into England was
the signal for hilarious debauchery. The
Ice of puritanism which had bound the
island as with iron broke all la a mo
ment, and immediately society dashed in
to every extreme. For a generation^ bois
terous merriment was everywhere; "never
before, never again, has there been in
England such unrestrained roistering, but
amid all the redundancy of wit ana fun
one may seek in vain tor a fragment of
true humor. The Intellect ruled supreme.
The age and Its literature took much of
its color from the king. Never has there
been an English monarch mote lacKing
in dignity. Me wa3 a good fellow among
good fellows.
At & drinking bout a certain Mayor,
who after many potations had ceased to
bo responsible lor his actions, swore ve
hemently that he would compel the kins
to drink -with him another bottle. The
monarch â¢ Instantly obeyed, for he de
clared.:
Good itore of good claret supplies everything,
And the tn.an that is Crunk Is as great a* a
king.
Ho chose as his counselors and favorites
men who were convivial and witty. Wltn
these boon companions, who haiied him
as "Old Rowley," he bandied jokes and
witticisms, laughing always loudest when
they got the better oÂ£ tua wit. "Rather
than not laugh, he would turn the Joke
upon himself."
"Ah, Shaitesbury." hÂ® cried, "you are
the greatest rogue in England." *Â°Of a
subject, fir," was tho quick response,
"undoubtedly I am."
By particular request the Earl of
Rochester composed the royal epitaph:
2ier* Uea oar sovereign lord, the king.
Whose word no man relies on.
Who never Bald a foolish tÂ£l2g
And never did a wise one.
"True." cried the king-, "for my dis
course is my own; my actions are my
ministry's."
When he had chided the celebrated Stlll-
Ingstieet for delivering before him a writ
ten strmon, the preacher suddenly de
manded why he himself read h;=Â» speeches
before Parliament. "Why, truly, L/octor,'
was the ready response, "your question is
a pertinent one and so will be- my answer.
I nave asked the two houses so often and
for so much money that I am ashamed to
look them in the tace."
"My lord, my lord," shouted the great
preacher South one morning, pausing In
nis sermon and shaking his linger at Lay
derdale. "you snore so loud you will waJce
the king."
With such a king and such a court Eng
land could prodice only one variety of lit
erary product, for it was the day of noble
patrunf. and no unpatronized author
could hope for success. Literature of the
intellect took at once the leading place,
for the first time in England satire, the
hurling of ridicule and wit at men and
manners to excite contsmpt arose con
spicuous. The first and In some respects
the leader of the satiric school was Sam
uel Butler, whose masterpiece, "Hudl
braa." became the textbook of the royal
court. The king- had it constantly with
in reach; the nobles and courtiers quoted
on all occasions Its brilliant epigrams and
sharp hits.
"Rudibras" is undoubtedly the most
witty sinple poem in the language. It
pretends io recount tlie adventures of a
kind of JPuriian Don Quixote, but the
story 13 lost in an endless fusillade of
quips and sharp savings, the most of
them at the expense of the Calvinists. Its
brilliant flashes are almost continuous,
yet one quickly tires of it. The mosc
brilliant b!aze of skyrockets at length
ceases to interest. "Wit is the god of mo
ments." says Bruyere, and Hudibras him
self evidently knew it. for. says Butler:
Although he had much wit
He was very Â«hy of using It.
As being loth to wear it cut:
And therefore bore it not about
Unless on holidays, or so
As men their best apparel &Â¦>.
Like all ancient wit "Hudlbras" has
become sadly tarnished by time. Despite
tha fact that for two cenerations it wa3
placed side by side with the best works
of Milton and was everywhere rated as
the supreme humorous masterpiece of the
language. It is almost unread to-day. How
can we laugh at jokes that take it for
granted that we know intimately all the
foibles and absurdities of the- I*uritaES
and their times? Yet for mere wit sorn?
passages of "Hudlbras" have kept fairly
well. Take, for instance, this character
ization of the Calvlnists:
For he waa of that stubborn crew
Of errant siir.ts, whom all men grant
To be the true church militant;
Such as do build their faith uron
The holy text of pike and gun.
And prove their doctrine orthodox
By eroetollc blows and knocks;
Call fire and sword and desolatioa
A godly thorough reformation,
Which always must be carried on
And still be dolny, never done; .
>Â» If rellcion were Intended
- â For nothing else but to be neafied:
A Â»ect whose chief devotion lies
In odd perverse antipathies.
Compound for sins they are inclined to
B" damning those they have- co mind to.
Hl3 brother poets came In for their
share of criticism, for he declares:
Those that writs In rhyme still make
The one verse for the other's sake;
For one for sense and one for rtiyine
I thmk's sufficient fcr one time.
John Dryden. the laureate of the era
made satire still more icpular. Compare
his picture of the Calv V^t with Butler's:
More hausrhty than the re>i. the wolfish race
Appear with belly gaunt and famished face-
Never was so deformed a beast of grace.
His rassed tail betwixt his leps he wears.
Close clapped for shame, but his rough crest
he rears
And pricks up his predestinating eaTS _
It was Dryden who first set the fashion
of lampooning in verse literary rivals. In
"'Macflecknoi" he pours out all the vials
of his spleen upon his old enemy. Shad
well. The ruler of the realms of non
sense. lookir.gr for a successor, thus solilo
quizes:
Shad well alone my perfect lma?e bears.
Mature in dullness from his tender years,
Shadwell alone of all my sons is he.
Who stands conflrmed in full stupidity.
The rest to mine faint meanins make pretense.
But Shadwell ne'er deviates into sense.
Thus he describes his publisher:
With leering looks, full-faced and freckled fair.
V.'ith two left legs and JudaÂ«-co!nred hair.
And frowsy pores that taint the ambient air.
The poSiry of the intellectual era cul
minated in Pope, the most witty of ths
English poets. He was the logical product
of Butler and Dryden. and he was In a
sense a culmination. His poems have all
the flash and brilliancy of strings of dia
monds and all the coldness. Nowhere is
there a touch of true humor. Take, for
instance, hiÂ«Â« picture in the "Dunciad" of
the field of English literature, where
ars Intones to ass.
Harmonic twang! of leather, horn and brass.
Or, again, where he compares the com
peting authors of the jay to divera In the
Thames â "a pig of lead to him who dive*
the best"â note how he disposes of the
scurrifous pamphleteer Arnall:
Not so bold Arnall: with a weight of skull
Furious he dives, rrsclpitately dull.
Whirlpools and storms his circling arms invest
With all the might of gravitation bl'st.
Xo crab more active in the dirty dance
IVivnward to climb, and backward to advance,
lie brings up half the bottom on his head.
And loudly claims the journals and the lead.
And what could say more In a single
line than this:
'Now night descending. - the proud scene waa
o'er.
But lived In Settle's numbers one day more. *Â¦
The teeming bitterness of Byron's
"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers."
written nearly a century later. Is but an
echo of this earlier age. Â¦ How like tha
"Dunciad." for Instance, is such a pass
age as this:
There Clerke, still stxivtBg plttously "to
pleaae."

Wilful, observes. "He's but my half

But it is idle to tear samples from the

Taine, "buffoonery in a noble style.," and
according to Dr. \Vhartpn "the best satire
extant." It abounds in playful touches,

There was no Boswell at AVUFa coffee
house, where Drydea so long- sat en
throned amoner the wits- of his day, nor
during the first ten years cf th* eigh
teenth century at Christopher Cat's,
where the thirty-nine members of the
Kit-Cat Club, all men of genius, met to
cat mutton pies and to revel in colloquial
banquets far more delicious.
The life and soul of this club was Con
greve, the dramatist, who was the liter
ary father of Pheri<3an. Lake "The
School for Scandal" of a later day, Con
greve's "Way cf the World" and "ThÂ»
Double-Dealer" depend not so much upon
their plots as upon the brilliant dialogue,
their bitin? saxcaain. which does not
spare even the finest ladies, and their
constant coruscation of wit and word
play. Even footmen and servants talk
witn as fine a polish and a_s nimble a wit
as their masters.
"I can't pretend to quote scenes." wrote
Thackeray in his "English Humorists."

which are undeniably bright, witty and

and a brilliant fish.wom?_i exc^anglr.g

a difficulty that confronts any onÂ© who
would quote from any of the writers of
the period, for it is undeniable that the
average Joko of the restoration era would

HOME STUDY CIRCLE
WHALERS SEEM TO HAYE MET WITH
SUCCESS IN THE ARCTIC LAST YEAR
A good example of some of the Ironies
of taxation has come to light over in San
ta Clara County. Th/> inhabitants of the
Mayfleld school district In meeting: as
sembled recently discussed the need of
better school accommodations. There was
no money in sight, yet every father real
ized that something must be donÂ© to place
better educational opportunities within
the reach of his children.
A special tax for school purposes was
the only solution to the problem. The
question of how much territory the dis
trict should embrace next presented itself.
Stanford University was some distance
away, but there was nothing in the world
to prevent taking In at least a portion of
the university, and its valuable grounds.
The tax has just been levied, and the- As
sessor finds that tho big Institution must
help along the school district of Mayfield
in the sum of !Â¦;>&.
Meanwhile tho people of Palo Alto dis
trict were astir over its inferior school
accommodations. Again the special tax
plan was inaugurated, and on top of the
$4?9 which goe3 to Mayfleld district the
university must pay $1575 toward main
taining the Palo Alto schools.
The ease has especial interest in view
Of the proposed amendment to the State
constitution, which provides that all in
stitutions of learning shall ba exempt
from taxation.
Mayfleld and Palo Alto Divide the
Immense College Grounds and

A distinct and marked Improvement In the

ingham and Philadelphia come confirmations of
the better Inquiry for piglron at a Blight ad
vance except In the case of the Southern prod
uct. This movement is regarded as significant
In connection with reported cutting of prices
by the English and Scotch Â¦ makers. Actual
WeÂ«tern livestock receipts for October were
very heavy, but prices have held well despite
this.
Wool is showing Increased activity, while
prices are firm, in sympathy with the better
tone of London and Melbourne advices.
Speculation on the various exchanges has
ruled rather slow. â¢ In wheat the moving feat
ure has been the reiteration of stories of Ar
gentine crop damage, which waa Instrumental
In Inducing some advance, much of which was
lost later.
Failures naturally show ' expansion over the
same period a year ago, but are much more
fa\crablc than In preceding years.
\ Unseasonable warm weather continues the
leading unfavorable feature of distributive
trade because of the check given to retail dis
tribution, and. therefore, to reorder business
in most lines of dry goods, wearing apparel
and shoes. Conservatism, in view of the near
approach of the election. Is undoubtedly an
element exercising considerable Influence par
ticularly in stock speculation, but a conspicu
ous exception to ttis is found In the reawaken
ing of demand and the advance In prices shown
in the iron trade in widely separated sections.
This is really one of the most Important de
velopments of the week, and Is taken as In
dicating not only that confidence In election
results is felt, but that consumers' stocks are
down to a minimum.

NEW TORK, Nov. .2.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: As the Presiden
tial election draws near the speculative stock
market has become more sensitive to the un
certainties which It involves. The upward
movement of prices, which waa the feature of
the preceding fortnight and which was. In
effect a discounting of the expected result,
has been checked by the general disposition
to take profits or to reduce commitments In
the market. The hardening of money ratm
over the election has also created conservatism
on the part of the commission-houses and the
tendency in such quarters is to have customers
restrict transactions for the moment. It ib
also noted that throughout the street the dis
position has been to call for much larger mar
gins and to otherwise prepare for any emer
gency. The market thus peems to have placsd
Itself in a position to await the outcome in
a calm way and It Is also noted that the
realizing by people who bought early In the
recent rise has not resulted In any material
declines. Large Interests and bull pools have
not made themselves prominent or given much
open support to the various prominent stocks
The professionals. In fact, have shown an In
clination to hold off, and the trading element
among them waa nearly ready to act on the
bear side. It Is noticed, however, that on any
concessions In prices good stocks have bee'
readily absorbed by outside buyers. This was
especially the case with the high-grade divi
dend-payers, though it extended to other stocks
as well and represented to a considerable ex
tent the outright purchase of securities to take
them entirely out of the market. This pro
cess was sufficiently well marked to afford
support to prices at the decline and to check
the tendency of the room to indulge in short
sales. It would also seem to result from the
general feeling In stock market circles that in
the event of a satisfactory victory for the
sound-money cause the market would be likely*
to broaden and advance. The foreign markets
were dull and heavy this week and London
did little here, being a seller on balance
Provisions were quiet. The market opened
higher on the advance in price at the stock
yards. The traders who were long In the prod
uct sold to realize and the market sagged and
closed easy. January pork closed 7',4#10c un

CHICAGO. Nov. 2.â Wheat prices, after an
active session, left an Irregular trail, but for
all Its sinuosities the tendency was plainly
downward. December opened %ft ! &c higher at
74',JS"'IVic under pressure from shorts, who
were surprised at a slight advance at Liverpool
In the face of the decline here yesterday. The
crowd, however, seemed to have plenty of long
stuff and the clear weather and an Arjrentlne
cable *r e PÂ°rtlnf? prospects "satisfactory" were
sufficient to bring much of it out. December
dropped to 74 !^c early, rallied to 74H2"4Hc and
then, pressed by additional Influences, Includ
ing liberal primary receipts and the closing of
three flour mills at Minneapolis, slumped to
7;:%c. On profit taking by shorts December ral
lied sharply to 73\c, but the Rdvanco failed to
find substantial support and further liquidation
sent the price back to 73Vic. The close was
weak, December %c lower at 73%c.

The market here was listless and dull to-day.
The cable chances cut no figure. Speculative
Interest to-day, however, was entirely lacking.
London regarded American securities with
equanimity and Berlin bought Southern Pa
cific, apparently on talk of dividend expecta

checked the movement. London now awaits
the results of the election without the slightest

to wants for immediate consumption. Some evi
dence appears of willingness to take specula
tive chances in the movement of a few stand
ard goods, notably of Iron and steel. The
actual resumption of operations In the anthra
cite coal fields has added largely to the work-
Ing force and closing down of a few email
steel plants Is only In the nature of concen
trating operations at more advantageous points
and has not much reduced the number of men
employed. The weather in uome sections has
favored business, but at New York has been
unseasonable, accounting for much of the loss
of 15.3 per cent In bank clearings here. En
couraging signs multiply in the iron Industry.
Strength In Bessemer and gray forge at Pitts
burg showB that the recent Increase in activ
ity of nnlshed forms has at last affected the
market for raw material. Improvement in
domestic buying of pig is the more noticeable
because of decrease in exports. Structural
shapes continue In urgent request, platea ad
vancing with active demand from shipbuild
ers and with talk of a pool to sustain the
price. Bar iron would sell readily at former
prices, but holders grow stubborn. Reports are
current that American concerns have contract
ed for machine shops In Bremen and numerous
brldefs abroad, including some In Africa. Bil
lets at Philadelphia cost JW, which does not
look like reduction in Bteel rails. Buyers In
these lines decided not to wait for election to
place contracts.
There waa also eome recovery In wheat,
started by the statement that Argentine would
net be able to export freely this year because
of the injury to the growing crop, bmall con
cessions are mado by Importers of raw sugar.

First Eleven Holds Ball Dur
ing All This Week's
Practice.
A large number pf men are still on tha
Injured list. Practice in the first eleven
has been handicapped through the tem
porary loss of Prlngle. Starr and Duden.
The second eleven Is badly broken up on
account of injured men taken from tha
team. The number of players hurt this
year has been unusually great.
The men were out at practice this even-
Ing, In spite of the sloppy condition of
the field. The cold weather seems to
agree with the team, as the playing has
been faster this week than heretofore.
The interference which has been worked
up within the past few days has been re
markable. The men play together In good
style. It Is a question, however, whether
such fine interference could be kept up
with a strange. eleven in opposition.
In no case this week has the second
eleven been given the ball. The first
eleven has had the privilege of holding
it constantly, with a view of good of
fensive practice. The ends and tackles
have been running with the ball, 'Wotnbie
and Castlehun doing most of thÂ« work In
this line. Warren Smith's end running
has been especially full of snap In recent
practice.

IvONDON. Nov. 2.â The South African
situation is improving and Lord Roberts
will shortly return to England with a
majority of his staff. Arrangements are
being made in Cape Town to send the
batch of refugees back to Johannesburg,
and accommodation is being provided at
Bloemfonteln for a garrison of 7000.
Nevertheless the activity of the Boers
continues. On October 26 a commando of
300 captured a garrison of thirty men at
Reddersburg, but afterward released
them. Trains from the south to Pretoria
are attacked by tho Boers almost daily.
On October 24 the burghers occupied Kof
feyfontein.
On tho other hand. General Knox has
Inflicted a reverse on General Dewet's
forces near Parris, capturing two guns,
one of them a weapon lost by the Brit
ish in the Sannas post affair.
The daily tale of British casualties is
heavy. During the month of October the
British lost 167 killed In action, including
nfteen officers, seventy-one of whom
died of wounds, 367 of disease, twenty-two
of accidents and ninety-seven captured or
missing, a total almost equal to the
monthly average for the duration of the
war.
The Daily Express publishes a sensa
tional statement that the Boer revival Is
more serious than has hitherto been be-
Heved. and that in consequence Lord Rob
erts' return is likely to be still further
postponed. It says, also, that no con
siderable party of troops will return be
fore January or February, while tho
regimental drafts from England will con
tinue and 5000 horses will be sent out.
The paper definitely declares that the
BoÂ«rs are well armed and abundantly
supplied with ammunition, and that the
campaign is likely to last another six
months.
In the best Informed quarters, however,
it la asserted that there is no ground
for the pessimism of the Daily Express.

to emphasize the menace wi.ich free sil
ver offered to every industry, and espe
cially to our wage-earners, that particu
lar feature of the platform was reaffirmed
in the most explicit terms possible.
â¢"Thus every dangor threatened by the
united partis of distress, discontent and
dishonor in 1RT*6 is assured in lf*"0. Not

NEW YOBK STATE SAFE.
Tammany Hall Realizes the Cause of
Bryan Is Hopeless.
NEW YORK. Nov. 2â From a source
considered reliable the Herald learned to
day that at a meeting of Democratic
managers at Tammany Hall the cause of
Bryan had been admitted to be hopeless.
Reports of district leaders for the rlty
show that it was Impossible for a plural
ity to be rolled for Bryan. Mr. Crokor
has been boasting of fiO.OOO In the Greater
cities. These both showed that it would
be far under 30.000.
' From another source, deemed equally
worthy of belief, the Herald heard, by
! way of Albany, that Senator Murphy and
Richard Oroker on karning the figures
for Albany County had confessed that
the State was hopelessly lost to Brvan.
In confirmation of these reports William
E. Curtis. Washington correspondent of
I the Chicago Record, sends the following
I to his paper:
"Mr. Croker practically gave up the
; fight for the Presidency this afternoon.
i After receiving reports from Tammany
I leaders in a!! the election districts in
j Greater New York and the result of their
I final canvass, the best he could do was
to figure out 31,000 majority for Bryan In
New York proper. 2200 in Queens and 1500
In Richmond counties, while reports from
Brooklyn show a probable Republican
majority of 15.000 in Kings. I have these
figures from unquestioned authority, al
! though Mr. Croker himself refused to
I verify them, and said they were 'all
I rot.' "

OAKLAND. Nov. 2.â Rev. R. W. .
Fraser. pastor of the Brooklyn
Presbyterian Church, delivered
an address this evening on the
subject of China. Rev. Mr.
Fraser was a missionary for two and a
half years In China, He was stationed
most of the time at Paottng-Fu. where
he designed and helped to build the mis
sionary buildups which were destroyed
during the recent Boxer uprising. Several
of his companions were killed by the Box
ers, Including a young lady missionary.
The lecturer was attired In the costume
of a Chinese scholar and made a striking
appearance. The dress consisted of a lon>?
body garment of blue silk, hanging from
the* shoulders and extending below the
knees. Over this was a Jacket of red.
He wore a cap and the regulation pig
tall. Rev. Mr. Fraser looked altogether
like a high-class Chinese. He "aid in
part:
The people of this country hs.ve a Â«n-eat mis
conception of the character of the people of
China the country Itself and Its resources.
They are apt to think the people are a* they
are hereâ members almost entirely of the labor-
Ins clacs. You will find that the Chinese are
an intellectual people.
It is within the present century that Chrfs-
Â¦
-tlan missions wÂ»r* first Ptartcd Jn China. Tor
th*- first fifty years the r>rr?K 1 1 mm was *>xpeed-
Ir.gly slow. But the la*t flftr years ha* seen
tliÂ» whole country dotted with Christian mis
*!on stations. There are S0O.0OO Christian com
iminlcants. A great many have accepted thÂ«
faith, but have not Identified themselves ac
tively with the church. TherÂ« are hundreds of
Christian schools, where ynunir men an edu
cated for conrmerelal and professional life.
It Is a mistake to suppose that the mlÂ§Â«tnn
ary is obnoxious to thÂ» people. As a foreigner
hp may Â»>Â». but when the purpose there Is un
derstood they -welcome him gladly. Of eoursÂ«
the missionaries have made mistakes. ThÂ»y
have invoiced the civil authority to protect
themselves and the native converts, and as a
consequence when the srfwemments of thÂ« re
srective missionaries have seized a slice cf
territory as compensation It has tended tr>
arouse distrust and hatred. But it can b#
clearly proved that this last trouble has been
due almost entirely to their innate aversion
and hatred of foreigners and foreign invasion.
What the future will be will Jarjrelv depend
upon the action by the powers now Interested.

the <?old Democracy In its fight against
Kryanlsm. to-night addressed the largest
and most enthusiastic audience which has
assembled during the national campaign
in Oakland. The exposition building was
packed. For two hours the eminent ex
ponent of the gold standard held his hear
ers in closest attention. His speech was a
masterpiece of eloquent, Intelligent, log
ical and entertaining argument. Colonel
Iri.<=h Introduced himself to his hearers,
lie was alone on the platform, and stood
there chairman and orator of this unique
meeting. At the outset he said: "I repre
sent what Is known as the Gold Democ
racy, or, as I call them, the "Honor Bright
Democracy.' " Then ne continued:
"When In 1STÂ»6 the party went astray we
refused to follow those who had aban
doned the principles of Jefferson, Jackson
and Cleveland. This year in every
State north of Mason and Dixon's
line we are, as in 18!)5, offering ourselves
as a bridge over which our country may
pass from peril to safety. In 189 ! < every
mÂ»"mbpr of the Republican party was com
mitted to sound money, and abides by
that faith now. The executive committee
of the Sound Money league has secured
a gold standard foundation for our Gov
ernment, and has in view other iinancial
measures which will assist still further In
straightening out the tangles which have
existed since tho middle of the civil war.
"Four years ago Bryan said If he were
beaten and the gold standard affirmed the
schools would be closed, that the people
would be shoeless and without clothes,
that all prices would fall as surely as a
Ftone falls that is cast Into the air, that
more mills would be closed, more men
be thrown out of employment and there
would be desperation, starvation and
crime.
"Every man, woman and child in this
nation knows that Bryan's prophecies
were false and foolish. Prices have risen
and mills are open and the number of new
ones has doubled. Instead of more men
out of work there are now more wage
earners better employed than in any other
nation under the sun.
â¢â¢We secured the adoption of the gold
standard. What has occurred? That leg
islation makes every bond of the United
States payable in gold coin, with every
dollar of national debt refundable in
bonds hearing 2 per cent, and those bonds
at a premium of 4*4 per cent in the money
markets of the world. The gold stand
ard has given us tho best public credit
ever enjoyed by any nation from the days
of the Assyrian. No nation has had a
public credit that pells Its 2 per cent bonds
at a premium of 4*2 per cent.
"Bryan has said 'The gold standard
shall endure only until I get the power to
destroy it." Let his followers ask them
selves how they will be benefited by his
destruction of the gold standard and the
public credit? How are you going to gain
by increasing the interest on the public
debt and by ruining our nation's credit?
England at her best estate has never been
able to do better than to fund at 3 per
cent consols and they have only been
above par at the narrow margin of 1 per
cent. During the last ten months they
have sold below par.
"Th'? next result we have from the cold
standard is the transformation from a
debtor to a creditor nation of the United

OAKLAND. Nov. 2.â With neither

paraphernalia to attract the

stration John P. Irish, a representative of
Eloqmept Chamnipaoe off the Gold Standard
Botlhiuises Immense AMdaemce by Ar=

twin partner of labor, has been cheap

"Bryan says the gold standard, the
foundation of these majestic results, shall
last only as long as he has the power to
destroy it. Speaking to Democrats call-
Ing themselves such and supporting Bryan
I say that to maintain the gold standard
was the duty of Cleveland and Carll6le.
but a sodden and besotted leadership of
Tfllmans. AUgelds. Vesta, Morgans and
Bryans held that party by the throat and
prevented it from doing what a Repub
lican Congress accomplished."
Colonel Irish then discussed Bryan's at
titude toward the three branches of go\
ernment and declared it was the policy
of the Bryanltes as manifested in the
Chlcapo and the Kansas City platforms
to destroy the independent judiciary, to
wreck the true theory of a separate legis
lative department and to abridge the
right of the executive veto by interposing
a system of direct lesrislatlon. which the
.speaker contended would, with the aboli
tion of the writ of injunction, work these
ends. Continuing Colonel Irish said:
"Four years ago Bryan told the people
he was the reincarnation of Thomas Jel
ferson. lie was trying then to lead the
Jeffersoninn Democrats into his popullstic
fold. This year he could not conjure U3,
so he is after the Republicans as the re
incarnation of Abraham I-Jneoln. I don't
want them to follow this pied piper of
Nebraska, with his song about the con
sent of the governed and self-government.
He needn't talk about Lincoln and self
government. Lincoln said the negro was
a human being and to deny self-govern
ment to a negro Is to deny self-govern
ment to all men. I challenge Mr. Bryan
to go to the public plaza of South Caro
lina and quote Mr. Lincoln. He would get
a colder reception there than the New
York ire trust could give him.
"When he was asked about North Caro
lina's dlsenfranchisement of the negro he
replied. 'Read tho Sulu treaty.'
"On my personal responsibility I say
that Mr. Bryan has never been able in a
legitimate vocation to earn enough to pro
vide for his own family. As he never
could do that, it is a sealed mystery to
him how any man can succeed. So he is
satisfied to style the great captains who
have established our great industrial sys
tem as rascals and thieves.
"Now, this problem of expansion would
never have been upon us if it had not been
for Bryan's advocacy of the treaty of
Paris. . If you support Bryan on the anti
imperialistic issue remember this, that If
he win3 the South, from which he expects
120 electoral votes, will never permit him
to abandon thÂ» Philippines. The South to
a man is in favor of expansion. Mr. Bry
an is introducing the gold-brick and saw
dust packape Into American politics.
There will be no change until the Ameri
can people have soberly and wisely solved
this problem.
"And to talk about making an empire
out of a republic. Free men. contented,
happy and prosperous, never could mako
such a chance. The Bryans of Rome paved
the way for the Imperial Caesar. With
their demogogic cries of discontent, with
their raising of class against class, with
their destructive policies they paved the
way. first to chaos, confusion and civil
strife â then Caesar marched In. That was
Imperialism.
"What, my good old Democratic friends,
has the leadership of this quack and em
pyrlc from Nebraska cost the party? It
has lost us eighteen seats In the Senate
of the United States. We have not a Dem
ocratic Senator nor a Democratic Gov
ernor nor a Democratic Legislature In a
Northern State, and seven seats In the
Senate are filled by Republicans from the
south of Mason and DIxon's line. This is
the result of the vocal manifestation of a
diseased ambition. I implore you Repub
licans to help us. so that when this man Is
beaten and hurled we may have !n this
United States two constitutional parties,
both of which shall be working for the
nation's happiness, differing only in their
method of attaining that end."

plosive than kerosene.
NEAV YORK, Nov. 2.â The police de
partment has been investigating the list
of persons reported missing: in connection
with the Tarrant fire for the purpose of
getting at a correct list of persons sup
posed to have lost their lives In the flre.
The persons reported were investigated
through the station nearest the address
given and in many cases they were re
ported safe. In some cases the police
could not find the supposed missing per

vised to-day shows eighteen persons re
ported mlsslr.g and not accounted tor.
Of these six are not known at Ihe ad
dresses given by the-persons who reported

In the list is the name of Benjamin
Moorehouse, a clerk for Tarrant & Go.
The authorities persist in their belief that
he Is alive and purposely keeping hi-*
whereabouts secret.
"We have detectives out after Mr.
Moorehouse and expect to land him soon,"
said Assistant District Attorney Walsh,
who is assisting in the Fire Marshal's in
vestigation.
Moorehouse's family and neighbors at
Montclair, N. J., are convinced that he
perished in the disaster. A resident of
Montclair, who was in Xew York at the
time of the flre, says "he saw Moorehouao
standing in front of the building directly
after the flre started, but since that time
no one has seen him or heard from him.
The flre department's investigation of tha
explosion closed to-day after the testi
mony of Louis Patterson and George C.
Thompson, employes of Tarrant & Co.,

The fstimates submitted in detail are as
follows: Star service, including special
office, $5,580,000: steamboat service. $586,
000; railroad tiansportation, $34,700,000;
railway postofltee cars. $4,861,000; railway
postal clerks, $10,378,749; mail messenger
service, $1,038,000; electric and cable â¢ car
service. $500,000; wagon service in cities,
$800,000; mail equipments, $326,500; miscel
laneous items, $1000; total inland service,
5.'<S.726,249. Foreign mail transportation,
$2,540,000; balances due foreign countries,
$155,000.
The total estimate for all mail trans
portation for the fiscal year ending June
30. 1902, is $61,430,249. being 52,158,610, or 3.64
per cent, more than the current appro
priation.
Relief legislation for families of those
killed In the service is asked and the
creation of a fund to retire on pay a clerk
whose usefulness is cut short by perma
nent disability incurred In the line of
duty. Reorganization and reclasslflcation
of the railway mall service, legislation're
quirinir separation of second-class mail
matter by publishers and legislation for
the punishment of persons who by force
attempt to enter a postal car or assault a
postal clerk on duty are recommended.
No estimate is submitted at this time for
pneumatic tube service or for special fa
cilities on trunk lines.
In the railway mail service, matter too
illegibly or improperly addressed to per
mit delivery amounted to 14,617,234 piece3,
an Increase of over 11,000.
The pneumatic service Investigation, it
Is stated, has developed valuable informa
tion, and the report will be submitted to
Congress soon after It convenes. Pending
that estimates for continuance and ex
tensions of existing service are withheld.
The electric cars have been found a most
advantageous means of providing expe
ditious mail transportation, especially for
suburban towns and In many cities save
the establishment'of w? ""on service.
Letter mail for the Interior of Alaska
was carried last winter by a service that
was reasonably well performed. For the
coming winter the arrangements double
the frequency of dispatches for points
supplied by various overland routes, sup
plying the offices along them with letter
mail four times a month. Mails will be
carried by reindeer this winter from Ea
ton to Kotzebue, a point north of the
Arctic circle. Plans for various overland
routes are announced and the necessity
emphasized of co-operation with the War
Department in opening an ail-American
military post road from Valdez to the
Upper Yukon.
The service in Porto Rico, Hawaii and
the temporary military postal service in
China are touched on briefly. The special
and general weighing of the mail
throughout the United States, whose re
sults were announced last February,
showed the railroads carried an aggre
gate much greater than generally sup
posed, and that $6 per cent of the total
amount was sent direct to the railroads.
The result of the regular quadrennial ad
justment with pay for railroad trans
portation in the second contract section,
comprising North and South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida. Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee and Kentucky, based on a re
weighing under orders issued to Septem
ber 30 last, was an increase of over 10 per
cent.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â The annual re
port of AV. S. Shallenberger, Second As
sistant Postmaster General, - was made
publio to-day. It shows that on June 3D
last the annual rate " of expenditure for
Inland mail &ervice was $55,146,000; for
foreign service, J2.014.538; total expendi
tures, $57,160,598. There were 22,834 star
routes, with a total mileage of 269,858, in
volving an annual rate of expenditure of
$5,133,373; 1943 special office routes,' 182
steamboat routes, 2668 railroad routes (an
nual expense $33,424,782), 223 railway post
office car routes (annual expense $4,309,
000), Â£655 railway postoflice clerks (annual
expenditure $8,916,424), 7190 mail messenger
routes, '220 wagon routes (in cities), 287
electric and cable car routes, five pneu
matic tube routes (annual expenditure
5222,266). Necessary and special facilities
on trunk lines of railroads involved an
annual rate expenditure of $195,143 and
mall equipments cost $325,744.
The routes of all kinds In the domestic
mall service cover .over, a half million
miles in length and the miles traveled
over them per annum was 459,205,773. An
average of almost nine trips a week on
each route was maintained throughout
the country. Mr. Shallenberger refers to
the steps taken looking- to stopping specu
lative bidding for mail contracts, and an
nounces that the new policy of awarding
all new contracts only to persons living on
or contiguous to the route involved
has worked satifactoril y. The experi
ment of box delivery on star routes,
whereby persons along the line could
have the mail brought from the next
office by the star route carrier and
left in a box erected by such persons,
has worked satisfactorily in South Caro
lina, and the next star route contracts
will provide for such service, increasing
the mail facilities in the rural distriÂ«ts
at a moderate increase in cost.

pleasant Experience After Ten
Years' Absence.
Gus C. Saville, who was manager of the
Orpheum In It3 early days, was robbed
Tuesday night of $200 in coin, a gold watch
and chain valued at $250 and a pair of eye

absence of ten years about a week ago,
and Tuesday evening met Dell Murphy,
whom he knew, and was Introduced by
Murphy to A. W. Shear. Â¦;
They drank considerable liquor, and the
last thing Savllle remembered was leaving
Kelly's saloon, on Eddy and Mason
streets, and going across the street to the
Olympia restaurant. He roomed at 114
Eddy street, and when he awoke next
morning all his money, and his watch and
chain had disappeared. - He notified the
police and Detective Bailey arrested Mur
phy and Shear and locked them up In "the
tanks."
Yesterday Savllle swore to a complaint

minutes later Murphy and Shear were re
leased from custody by order of Captain
Seymour.

A scathing denunciation of those who
hold thati the pulpit Is but for dissemina
tion of hard and . fast I religious dogmas
was delivered by Rabbi Nieto in the Sher-
Ith Israel Tabernacle last night. before a
large congregation.. The lecture was the
first of a series of Friday night- lectures
which will be delivered in this church and
Temple- Emanu-El during the winter
months. ;\ -
Â¦Â¦â¢-. The speaker's .views on the subject were
"strong and couched in no uncertain lan
guage. Rabbi; Nieto declared that it was
the duty of the pulpit to discuss the issues
of the day. tending to affect the moral
condition of a people. This, he said, was
the method of the old religious teachers,
who thereby attained a hold on their fol
lowers reached by no other advocates of
a religious system. The sermon in part
was as follows:
"Very many people have peculiar ideas
as to what the pulpit is for. They regard
it as the place from which constructions
of whatever nature may be pleasing to
the preacher are placed upon legends and
tales of miracles, which may or may not
be true/contained in the Bible.
"It is part of the duty of the modern
pulpit to mold the people whose ears it
may be able to reach. I say that it Is the
duty of the pulpit to discuss the probable
moral effect on the people of the current
events of the day.
"You say politics . has no right in the
pulpit. I say that any principle or Issue
which affects the foundation of a social
system has every right In the pulpit.
"The pulpit should endeavor to impart
knowledge and understanding on any sub
ject, moral, political or social, that af
fects the moral condition of the people. It
is not -a -free pulpit from which a man
may speak on one subject and be gagged
on another.
"The pulpit has a place in the education
of our times. A priest-ridden people. Is no
better than an ignorant people. The priest
should be broad-minded Â¦ and his people
should be allowed every . freedom- to in
quire into everything affecting their moral
well-being. -You require some influence to
awaken your moral consciousness, for he
who votes for something he knpws noth
ing of > the : rights or wrongs of Is neces
sarily dishonest."

"'Home Again From a Foreign Shore"
wae the air that greeted the Shriner pil-.

Caroline approached the majestic Zealan
dia. off Alcatraz Island, on the-latter'a re
turn-from the Hawaiian Islands.
Tiie.Shriner steamer, decked out above
and. below; with holiday bunting and with
the Islam temple flag at j the forepeak.
was met by the Caroline, having on board
about <bne hundred ladies and gentlemen.
The welcoming Shriners all wore the red
tez of the temple and the ladies each car
rted a silk American flag, which they
waved and waved again in. token of glad
ness; that 'their relatives and friends were
with . them again- When the. two vessels
approached .to hailing distance. there was
si loud hurrah from those on the Caroline
and a. hearty response from those on the
Zealandla.- The band on the ocean steam
er played "Ain't I Glad I'm Out of the
Wilderness." and Steam Pianist Levy on
the Caroline responded with "Home.
â¢Sweet Hotrie" on the calliope. Before the
last strains of the "music" had died away
there was a chorus of shrill whistles all
along' the water front in token of wel
come home. The Caroline escorted the
Zealandia to; her berth. Then there was a
rush for the Zealandia, and for the next
few minutes there were handshaking, kiss
ing, crying and laughing, as the spirit of
Â¦each individual moved him or her. in ex

who had been absent for nearly a month.
It. was a happy" meeting, and the consen

people as I ever met with. In expectation
of our coming they had erected a dancing
pavilion, which was made brilliant with
flags, bunting and native greens. We -were
treated to a native dinner, which we had
to partake of with only the right thumb
and forefingers. These native dinners are
no burry-me-quick affairs, for they are
all prepared in beds of hot stones, and it
takes three or lour days to cook such a
meal as was served to us."
While at Hilo the visitors went to the
volcano and took in all the sights. The
Shriners kept open house on board of the
ship, where they entertained about a thou
sand of the people of Hilo in that manner
for which Shrlners are noted.
At Honolulu the hospitality of the isl
anders won the admiration of all. At this
point the Shrlners held a reception on the
steamer and entertained about two thou
sand people. Thirty of the pilgrims, who
combined business with pleasure, " re
mained over to transact their business,
and will come up on the next regular
steamer. The Zealandia left the islands
on the 25th of October and had a pleasant
trip up.

full determination to issue an edition' of
the Moslem Herald each day on the trip,
fell downin-hls pood resolution.- Some
days the Herald appeared and some days
it did not. When it did appear Neal issued
two or three editions to keep the record
straight.
Arrangements are being- made to give

Josephine A. Ledderhas. the mother of
the four-year-old child who was recently
committed to an asylum to be treated for
homicidal mania, died yesterday.
The death of the woman Is a particularly
tad one, for it is traceable directly to. the
care and worry caused by the presence of
her little son. Some time in hie infancy he
hurt himself In a fall arid the effect was
to develop In him the most violent type
of homicidal and suicidal mania. If left
alone he would attempt to da*>h his brains
out oerainst the -walla or the floor, and so
his mother never allowed him out of her
sight and most of the time she held him
in her lap. She grave him every care, but
the strain was telling- upon her, and -when
she finally broke down the child was taken
from her and she was sent to SL Wini
fred's Hospital for treatment. It was
thought her health could be restored, but
she still worried over her child and it soon
became apparent that she would not sur
vive.
Mrs. Josephine Ledderhas, Whose Little Son Was Recently Sent to
an Insane Asylum for Treatment, Passes Away.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
from the residence of her sister, Mrs. J.
W. Barber, at 6 Golden place, off
Golden Gate avenue, between Hyde and
Larkln. The services will be held In St.
Boniface's Church, Golden Gate avenue,
and the interment will be in Mount Cal
vary Cemetery.
Mrs. Ledderhas was the Â¦wife of Theo.
Ledderhas of this city and the mother of
four children. She was 32 years of age
