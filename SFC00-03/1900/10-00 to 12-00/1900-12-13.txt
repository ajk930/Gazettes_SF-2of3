In the general office here three new men

the amateur operators acquainted with
their duties. Before the strike two ordi

have time to spare.
This statement of Newman seems to be
substantiated by the difficulty attending

deputy sheriffs sworn in and distributed
them along the line between here and

Lieutenant General Miles had a slight
accident while heading the centennial pa
rade to-day, a break In his horse's saddle
girth giving the general a fall. The head
of the parade had just passed the Presi
dent's reviewing stand, and General
Miles, having saluted ithe President, had
turned his horse toward the House wing
of the Capitol. The saddle girth suddenly
parted, permitting the eaddle to turn on
the animal, and General Miles .was seen
to fall sideways. The horse did not plunge
and an officer sprang forward. Being a
good horseman. General Miles saved him
self from being thrown with force, and
suffered nothing save the Inconvenience

A company of Jackies from the Gov
ernment yacht Dolphin had literally
swathed the hall In flags. The fronts of
the galleries were hidden by them, the
brass railings which marked off the lob
bies were festooned with them and the
Speaker's marble rostrum was covered
with them. Not more than half were
American flags, and this fact was at first
rather startling, until the full beauty of
the color scheme dawned upon the spec
tators. From the galleries every other
flag was that of a foreign country. The
royal flag of England was draped from
the reserved gallery on the east, next the
executive gallery, and the Imperial black,
white and red of Germany on the right.
The crested flag of Austro-Hungary, the
trl-color of France, the royal ensign of
Russia, the green, white and red of Mex
ico, and even the red and yellow of Spain
were there. But below, circling the hall
and walling in the distinguished assem
blage, were the glorious buff and blue
under which the Continental army of
Washington had achieved the independ
ence of the American republic, while con
fronting the audience, back of the Speak
er's desk, was the beautiful silk flag of
the republic, and from it, stretching away
on either side over the paintings of La

WASHINGTON. Dec. 12.â With
imposing ceremonies the na
tional capital to-day cele
brated the centennial anni
versary of the founding of
the seat of the Federal Government in
Washington. The exercises combined a
brilliant military parade, a review by the
President from the east front of the Capi
tol and orations in the hall of the House
of Representatives, where a brilliant au
dience was assembled. By act of Con
gress, the day was made a national holi
day in the District of Columbia. The Gov
ernment departments â¢were closed, busi
ness was suspended and the whole city
gave itself over to celebrating the
capital's natal day. President McKinley
and the members of his Cabinet took a
prominent part in all the exercises, and
with them were the chief executives of a
large number of the States and Territo
ries of the Union, the Senators and Rep
resentatives in Congress, the Judiciary of
the United States Supreme Court, the
Embassadors and Ministers from foreign
courts, the heads of the army and navy
and a great outpouring of the people.
Although Washington is the scene of
many celebrations, it If seldom that one
has occurred here of greater brilliancy in
Its outdoor features or of more impres
siveness In Its ceremonial exercises at the
Capitol and at the White House. Early in
the day the President received the Gov
ernors of States and Territories at the
White House and the model for a new
and enlarged White House to commem
orate to-day's exercises was unveiled with
suitable addresses.
At 1 o'clock the President was escorted
to the Capitol, where he reviewed a- pa
rade headed by Lieutenant General Miles
and including the full military strength of
the capital, regulars and military. The
ct-remonies at the Capitol began at 3:30
p. m. and included addresses by Senators
Daniel of Virginia and McComas of Mary
land. Representatives Payne of New York
und Richardson of Tennessee and a nota
ble historic oration by Senator Hoar of
Massachusetts. A reception by the Presi
dent to the Governors of States at the
Corcoran Art Gallery to-night closed the
festivities.
After the parade came imposing exer
cises In the hall of the House, where
gathered as distinguished a company as
its walls had ever held. On the floor were
the President and the members of the
Cabinet, the members of the Senate and
House, the Kmbassadors and Ministers of
foreign countries in full court uniform, the
Chief Justice and associate Justices of

\^ While the union jack of England

the British Embassy, by order of
Lord Pauncefoto, in honor of the Capitol
centennial celebration, the same flag was
taken down from the decorations in the

flags of other powers were left in place.

box were used in the decorations. The
American flag, of course, predominated,
but from. each of the galleries was the
draped flag of a foreign nation.
The British flag had a conspicuous posi
tion below the women's gallery adjoin
ing the executive gallery, which, in turn,
adjoins the diplomatic gallery. Other for

arranged around the hall were those of
Colombia, Guatemala, Greece, Sweden.
Belgium, Austria-Hungary, The Nether
lands, Switzerland, Honduras, France,
Germany and Haytl.
When Speaker Henderson reached the
Capitol, after having attended the exer

private room without going Into the hall
of the House. Representative Reeves of
Illinois entered soon afterward and told

THE BRITISH COLORS HAULED
DOWN FROM THE DECORATIONS
LONDON. Dec. 12.â Lord Kitchener
cables the War Office from Pretoria, un
der date of December 12, that General
Knox reports from Helvetia that he Is
engaged in a running fight with General
Dewet, and that the enemy Is moving
toward Reddersburp, where there is a
column ready to co-operate with the other
British forces.
Lord Kitchener, in another dispatch, re
ports that the Boers attacked the post
near Barberton. The British casualties
were three killed, five wounded and thir
teen taken prisoners. The captured men
have since been released.
The Boers raided the Riverton road sta
tion December 11. They are being fol
lowed up.
General Kitchener's .message indicates
that Dewet has again evaded Knox. Af
ter the latter had foiled the Boer general
at Coomassie Drift, the Boers seem to
have doubled back, crossed the Caledon
River elsewhere and turned thence north
west, in the direction of Reddersburg, the
memorable scene of the British disaster
in April, when Dewet captured the Irish
Rifles.
STATESMEN DISSATISFIED.
Suggestion Made for Granting Ocn-
era! Amnesty to the Boers.
LONDON, Dec. 1-.â Considerable irrita
tion was aroused during to-day's debate
in the House of Commons on supply. Sir
Robert T. Reid, Q. C. Liberal member
for Dumfriesburgh, painted a gloomy pic
ture of the conditions in South Africa. He
said that after fourteen months of war.
costing Â£5,000,000 per month, anarchy was
prevalent and famine threatened, and this
may te followed by a native rising. An
attempt to place the colonies under mili
tary rule, he said, would imperil the very
existence of the empire. He thought the
time had arrived for offering the Boers
terms not inconsistent with British domin
ion. All ideas of unconditional surrender
should be discarded.
James Bryce, Liberal, followed on sim
ilar lines. He suggested granting general
amnesty to the Boers now in arms as le
gitimate combatants. The negotiations,
Mr. Bryce also said, should not be intrust
ed to Sir Alfred Milner, who was the ob
ject of almost universal distrust, includ
ing at least half the Queen's subjects in
South Africa.
Mr. Broderick. the Secretary for War,
hotly challenged Mr. Bryce's statements
regarding Sir Alfred Milner.
Sir Robert Reid's speech. Mr. Broderlck
asserted, was impracticable, unwise and
mischievous. The Government was per
fectly willing to offer terms for surrender
so long as it could not be interpreted as
proof of weakness and thereby cause a
prolongation of the guerrilla warfare.
After further recriminations the report
of supply was agreed to.
During subsequent discussion in commit
tee of ways and means, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer. 31r Michael Hicks-Beach,
promised that a considerable proportion,
of the cost of the war should be obtained
from the Transvaal. He added that a
treasury committee had chosen a commis
sioner to proceed to the Transvaal to as
certain its asÂ£et3 and taxable capacity. Sir
David Barbour. continued the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, had been selected tor
this task.
The resolution was then agreed, to and
the House adjourned.

Redmond presiding. After resolutions had
been adopted amending the constitution
of the United Irish League and making
the Nationalist convention an annual
fixture, William O'Brien moved a strong
ly worded resolution in favor of the
abolition cf landlordism in Ireland and
the transfer of the soil to the occupying
proprietary. Ireland's struggle, he de
clared, should continue without ceasing
until the landlords were forced to aban
don their present intolerable system of
dual control.

tinued Mr. O'Brien, will devote Its time
to bringing to the doors of landlords, land
grabbers and their castle allies the In

The resolution was adopted amid the
utmost enthusiasm.
Resolutions appealing for funds from
America and elsewhere, to be used against
Jury packing and for the propagation of
the Irish language, were adopted.
The convention adopted resolutions fa

HEALY ON HIS EXCLUSION.
Not Worried by Acts of Convention
and Will Work On as Usual.
LONDON. Dec. 12.â Timothy Healy Is
not a whit disturbed by his exclusion
from the Irish party. He has neither the
intent'on of resigning nor of forming an
opposition section. He is avowedly hos
tile to Mr. DHlon and still more so
toward T. P. O'Connor, who, Mr. Healy
alleges, is behind the whole movement,
nnd ho is utterly hopeless of the cause of
Ireland. In the course of a lengthy Inter
view Mr. Hoaly said:
"I care nothing for the action taken.
Inasmuch as such action and such scenes
hurt our cause, I shall take no notice of
the resolution, nor If I can help it will
any of my Parliamentary supporters. My
constituents passed a vote of confidence
In me last Friday. I shall acknowledge It
and do the best I can to help Ireland on
the lines I have pursued for the last
twenty years. I shall look^ upon Mr. Red
mond as my loader and follow his wishes.
But the O'Brien crowd is not likely to let
Mr. Redmond continue long in the leader,
ship."
Mr. Healy, In a letter to his constitu
ents acknowledging the vote of confi
dence, said:
"The seasoning which comes to a cam
paigner of old service converts even the
rubric of the gloomiest executioner into
a source of gayety. In fact, I find so much
fun in poor William O'Brien that I free
ly forgive him all his incantations."
VICTOBY FOR O'BRIEN.
London Journals Comment Freely on
the Home Rule Fight.
LONDON, Dec. 12. â The newspapers re
gard yesterday's Nationalist convention
at Dublin as a victory for William
O'Brien, but comment at length on the
turbulent scenes. The Times thinks Mr.
Redmond must regret the candor of his
opening speech, wherein he warned the
audience that if the proceedings end in a
spectacle of rancor and disorder the" evil
effects would continue for a lifetime.
The Dally Chronicle, always sympa
thetic with Ireland and home rule, says:
"How long will the tongues of their own
delegates be the greatest stumbling block
the Irish have to overcome in their strug
gle for home rule? How long will Na
tionalist meetings continue to furnish the
detractors of Ireland with weighty ar
guments for " frustrating reasonable
hopes?"
The Dally News says: "Mr O'Brien
must henceforth be the real leader of
Irish nationalism and his formal adop
tion cannot be long delayed. ;â¢ If Mr. /Red
mond Is re-elected Parliamentary chair
man next session/' it< will-simply- be as an
instrument and puppet of Mr. O'Brien. Of
his obvious fervent patriotism In the
Irish sense there can be no doubt. He Is
a generous, single minded enthusiast. His
sagacity is less obvious."

John Redmond will decline the leadership
at the next session of Parliament.

of the Indianapolis Gas Company
of this city made formal announce
ment to-day that the directors had de
ferred action on the dividend for an in
delinite period, owing to what the di
rectors characterize as the "most extra
ordinary social conditions which prevail
at present in the city of Indianapolis."
The gas company accuses the citizens of
Indianapolis of stealing gas.
The Evening Post prints the following
statement of the directors of the com
pany to the stockholders:
"In spite of existing prohibitory statutes
a large percentage of our customers have
unlawfully increased their supply by the
practice known as 'boring out 1 their
mixers. Every effort has been made by
your managers to stop this unlawful
wastage, but although the best legal tal-.
ent has been employed, supported by in
disputable proofs, it has been found utter
ly impossible to secure a conviction, be
cause of the fact that this Illegal prac
tice haa been so generally Indulged in.
These violations of the law are not con
fined to the poor or vicious, but include
city and county buildings, city officials,
ministers of the gospel, lawyers, physi
cians, architects and sortie of the most
prominent residents and business houses
in the city of Indianapolis."

the charge made by President Benedict of
the Indianapolis Gas Company at New

they have Yiot stolen natural gas. There
has been no gas to steal. They say the

that mixers have been bored, but even
this did not Increase the supply. Gas is

Governor General, a month ago was not

KANSAS CITT, Mo., Dec. 12â In 1843
Colonel Amos Williamson kept a hotel at

planter named Merrell, his Cherokee wife
and his half-breed Cherokee daughter.
Margaret. Color>el Williamson fell' In love
with the daughter, corresponded with her
for three years, and in 1S52 they were mar
ried In San Francisco. After a time Col
onel Williamson and his bride went to the
latter's former home at Fort Gibson, I. T..
where a daughter was born and named
Mary.
Colonel Williamson was so rabid a
Northerner that,' when the troublous
times preceding the war came on the
Cherokees, who were Southern sympa
thizers and many of them slaveholders,
drove him out of the territory. His wife's
sympathies were with her people, and she
refused to go with him, but he took the
daughter Mary. He went to Missouri,
where he raised a Union regiment. His
wife heard of this, and cast him off ab

Why should I? The other men have no
grievances, and It will not assist the
Santa Fe strikers if the others do go out.
I cannot say whether or not the train
men will strike. That is a matter for
them to determine, and over which I have
no control. One of the greatest operators'

Chancellor of Germany.
Conditions Identically Outlined by
After the Imperial Chancellor had
ppoken Herr lit-bel asked him whether
Kmperor 'William's message that he
"could not receive now" meant an abso
lute refusal or that he would receive Mr.
Kruger later. Count von Bulow did not
reply. ___^
POWERS ARE A<JREEI>
ON THE JOINT NOTE
Alluding then to Emperor "William's re
rent speech, he asked: "How does this
agree with that proud expression 'civis
Homanus sum?' " <I am a Roman citizen),
and he sarcastically contrasted the non
reception of Mr. Kruger with the recep
tion extended to Cecil Rhodes in Berlin.
Prior to Von Bulow's speech Dr. Hasse,
the Pan-German leader, sharply criticised
the failure of the Government for not re
ceiving Mr. Kruger. Admitting that .Ger
many could not adopt any other position
than strict neutrality, he thought the
Government should avoid the semblance
of breaking neutrality in favor of Eng
land. He referred to the services done
England by a German ship in South Af
rican waters, and complained further that
the manner of the refusal to see Mr.
Kruger had wounded German sentiment.
He added that the English thought they
could give Germany treatment different to
that extended to other nations claiming
that English officers had treated Germans
scandalously in South Africa, saying of
them, "They are only Germa"ris," whereas
they treated Frenchmen and even Greeks
well.
'"On the other hand, the Germans who
have been fighting side by side with the
Boers have not met with a happy lot.
They have be?n dismissed without pay
and told 'we did not Invite you.' "
"It has appeared to me that these ex
pulsions in many cases have been both un
justifiable as to cause and manner and
<ontrary to the principles of international
law, and an expression of this view haa
been made in London.
Baron von Richthofen, Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, referring to the
expulsion of Germans from the Transvaal
and Orange Free State territory, said:
"I commit no diplomatic indiscretion in
saying that the reception of that telegram
outside of Germany left no doubt that in
the event of a conflict in South Africa
Germany would have to rely solely on her
own strength."
Continuing, the Chancellor said the An
glo-German agreement of l&s did not con
tain a provision relating to war between
'Great Britain and the South African re
publics. The Vang-tse and Samoan treat
. ies had no secret clauses. When the Em
peror, in 1S96, sent the telegram to Mr.
Kruger. there was no question of war be
tween the states. It was a matter of a
filibustering expedition. The Emperor did
. not intend to determine German policy
forever by that Telegram. The Chancellor
added:
For the Emperor only German national
considerations were authoritative. If fam
ily relations or dynastic considerations in
tiuenced the foreign policy he would not
lemain Minister another day.
The Chancellor repudiated the sugges
lion that the Government's suggestion
was due to any wish from the English
court or from the Emperor to himself, the
chancellor.
The Cha-ncellor added: "We apprised him
courteously and considerately, through t^e
Paris embassy and Dr. Leyds, that the
Kmperor regretted that he was not in a
losrition to receive. Notwithstanding tnis.
Mr. Kruger was told again at Cologne,
in the most considerate terms, that the
Kmperor was not able to see him."
BERLIN, Dec. 12.â In the Reichstag to
day the Imperial Chancellor, Count von
Bulcw, referring to the complaints which
have arisen on account of Emporor Wil
liam's failure to receive Mr. Kruger, went
lengthily again Into the reasons for the
non-reception of Mr. Kruger. covering
new ground in a statement which he made
as to the relations between Germany and
Great Britain. He said that the an
nouncement that Mr. Kruger was coming
was made twenty-four, or at the most,
forty-eight hours before his leaving for
Berlin. Up to that hour it had been as
sumed that Mr. Kruger would go from
Paris to Holland.

Turkey's Eultr Most Anxious to

AMERICANS AT
SULTAN'S DINNER
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.-In spite of
the most careful search in all di
rections, no 1'prht is shed on the
mystery of the disappearance pi
John Armstrong Chanler from
Blooruingdale Asylum. It is believeil,
however, that he is still alive, notwith
standing the first impression that he had
met with foul play.
The missing man Is a son of John Win
throp Chanler, who died at Rokeby, his
country home, near Rhinebeck, in 1S77.
His mother was a Miss Ward, a grand
daughter of John Jacob Astor. Mr. Chan
ler is a graduate of Columbia, a lawyer
by profession, and x.;s interest in art led
him to found the "Paris Prize Fund,"
which provides an income of $DQO a year
for the tuition in Paris of its winner.
Mr. Chanler and Amelie Rives were
married at the height of her popularity
won by writing "The Quick or the Dead? '
The young New York lawyer, a scion of
one of the be^t families, met the impet
uous Virginia girl, who was still in her
teens, dui'4ng her first season at New
port. The' wooing was brief, and a wed
ding at Castle Hill lollowed on June 14,
1X85. Mr. and Mrs. Chanler went abroad
and remained for some time. Rumors
of disagreements, partings and reconcil
iations reached this country. Then Mr.
C\.anler went to Airica to shoot tigers
and elephants, while his wife remained
in Paris studying art.
It was announced in October, 1S95. that
a divorce had been granted on the ground
of incompatibility 01 temperament.
Pierre Troubetskoy, a Russian Prince,
arrived in this .country in 18iÂ»6 and Amelie
Rives was married to him.
Mr. Chanler was in broken health, and
his wife's second marriage is said to have
preyed upon his mind, so that with anxie
ty and annoyance over business cares, to
which he was unaccustomed, his condition
became such that his friends had him
committed to Bloominfrdale.
Mr. Chanler's chief delusion is said to bo
that he is a great personage, with power
and influence, and that other great men
are jealous of him and are conspirinp to
kill him. One of his hallucinations for a
time was that he was a sort of Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde. He has been examined
by Dr. Carlos MacDonald and others, who
have diagnosed his case as incurable, lie
has an income of about ?30,000 a year
and is 40 years old.
Death of Brigadier Bins.
The body of Confederate Brigadier Gen
eral Herman Bins has been found in
Black Swamp, four miles from Morris
town, N. J. He was known as the hermit
of Wanong Mountain. For thirty-five
years Bins had lived a solitary life on the
side of Succassunna Mountain. He had
little to do with any one and his retreat
was far removed from the nearest house.
His cabin was found in ashes by those
who went to it after the body had been
identified. Bins made his appearance on
the mountain in 1S65. When he first came
he wore a gray uniform and on it were
the stars of a brigadier general.-
Ten years after Bins settled on the
mountain his life story came out through
no fault of hi?. William Becker, a vet
eran of the Union army,- who had occa
sion to visit Atlanta in 1S75, commenced
an investigation and foand from the Con
federate records that Herman Bins had
enlisted as a minor officer soon after Sum
ter was fired upon. He rose rapidly and
at Â»the close of the war had the rank of
brigadier. At the outbreak of the war
Bins was a well-to-do planter' in Middle
Georgia. While he was in the army hb
two children died. When Sherman march
ed to the sea, cutting a gap through Geor
gia and leaving desolation behind, Bins'
home was one of the places of which
nothing remained but ashes. Mrs. Bins

A notable feature of the election was
the victory of G. O. Moen. Some time ago
he was appointed Police Commissioner to
fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Commissioner Scheive. A* question arose
as to whether Moen could hold until the
expiration of Scheive's term in 1904 or un
til this election. The Republicans took
the ground that a commissioner would
have to be elected, and accordingly nomi
nated D. H. Welch. Moen was not nomi
nated, but his friends started his candi
dacy, and. although his name did not ap
pear on the ballot, succeedeed In electing
him by a rousing majority. This is be
lieved to be the only case on record on
this coast where an unnominated candi

VICTORIA, Dec 12.-Details were re
ceived by R. M. S. Empress of India of
tne great typhoon which ravaged Honc
kor.g on November 10, causing heavy less
cf life and immense damage to shipping.
No part cf the city escaped. Wreckage
and debris were Etrewr everywhere after
the gale; the British wnboat Sandpiper
had foundered and or.t of her seamen
lest his life; the American ship Uenja
mln Sewell had gone ashore; in all seven
ty-seven launches had been wrecked and
more than I50Q natives drowned. At Kow
loon and other points there was heavy
loss of life, and when the dread totals
cf the death harvest were in It was found
ttat thousands had been killed. The big
i-mpress of India was moored at her
w.iari .^at Kowloon and she was badly
shaken. The typhoon is said to have been
the worst since the disastrous one of 187*.
when the loss of life was tremendous.
Shipping suffered even more than tha
nouses, thousands cf which were razed.
Junks and launches were driven ashore
on all sides. From tee police pier at Tsim-
Tsat-Teui up to JIocg-Kog-Tsul was one
mass of wreckage, launches, lighters,
junks and sampans having been ua=ho-i
ashore and knocked into matchwood. The
Hongkong Telegraph says the loss of life
there must have been appalling, it being
impossible to estimate the number of the
dead.
Among the gallant Europeans whose
lives Â¦were lost was Sergeant Duncan of
the police, â¢who was crushed to death in
the wreckage while saving life.
When the gale was at Its height ths
British warships anchored at Kowloon
were in a grievous plight. The gunboats

when the crews would have a poor
chance for safety, especially when it is

cific depot, left his home on Julian street
yesterday afternoon to lake a younger
brother to a near-by kindergarten. On the
way back from the kindergarten he met
Lecnard Hal wick, a white boy aged 13;
Prince Godfred, a negro aged 15; and an
unknown boy about 16 years old. Kern,
who is very small for his age. was en
ticed intc a vacant lot on Julian street,
rear the creek, by th'e boys to play. After
a few minutes of rough play the negro
ea.u?ht him by the â¢Â¦aist and threw him.
down. TtLe other two boys then held him.
while Godfred lighted sulphur matches
ar.J held them close to the child's face.
The boy screamed with pain and begged
to be allowed to go. but the three lada
gleefully continued the torture until he
was almost insensible from pain and
fright.
The young hoodlums declared their in
tention to burn the child to death at the
stake. Not until his cries -were heard by
passers-by did they desist.
Godfred and Halwlck were arrested on
charges of cruelty to-day, but the lat
ter was subsequently released. Godfred
has been held ?n $50) bonds and probably
will be sent to the Reform School.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
URIAH, Dec. 12.â Otto H. Mohr, claim
ing to be a San Franciscan of some liter
ary note, is an inmate of the Uklah Jail.
Mohr was captured after a long search in
San Francisco and brought back to this
city yesterday. The charge upon which
he is held is that of "beating" a board
bill, but numerous business men and lead
ers in Ukiah society are mourning over
the intimate and expensive acquaintance
they cultivated with the young man. The
amounts of which he defrauded gullible
Uklah citizens aggregate a considerable
eum.
About October 1 there came to Uklah a
young man of rather striking presence,
who introduced himself as from San Fran
cisco, and claimed to be a member of the
staff of Leslie's Magazine. He repre
sented that he had just been on to New
York for consultation with the proprietor
of the Leslie publications. His specialty
was writing short stories, in which line
he had been very successful, starting first
with Munsey, and afterward going over
to Leslie's on a largely increased salary.
He was a graduate of Heldelburg Univer
sity In Germany, In proof of which he
showed a large silver medal. His true
name was Otto H. Mohr, but for pen pur
poses he had changed it, and was known
in the literary world as M. Helmlt Otto,
lie was a personal friend and chum of
Mr. Dunne, of "Mr. Dooley" fame. He
was the translator of "Sapho," and by
that work he had achieved much literary
celebrity. At the time of his arrival here,
according to his story, he was writing a
novel which was to mark a new era In the
history of fiction, and was in search of a
secluded place, undisturbed by the rush
and roar of metropolitan life, â¢where he
could quietly de\Â£>te himself to the com
pletion of this work, varying the monot
ony by turning out short stories for Les
lie's.
Mohr put up at the Palace Hotel, en
gaging a suite of the best rooms. Through
his suavity of manner and honesty of
mien he was soon persona grata with
some of the best families of the town, and
his dark, rolling eye is said to have cap
tivated more than one fair damsel. To
some he said that he had a wife in San
Francisco, but with the fair sex he posed
as an eligible single man.
Everything went along very smoothly
for Hi Helmtt Otto until a. famine struck
his purse. Then he began borrowing. His
various medals, his alleged credentials
from Leslie's and hla "smooth" talk suf
ficed to inspire confidence in the minds of
many, and his requests for temporary
loans were granted. Finally, about No
vember 15, he informed his landlord that
he was going fÂ» San Francisco for a brief
visit and to get some drafts cashed, after
which he would return.
He went, but he did not return. "Weary
of 'waiting, the landlord, O. E. "tt'illiams,
procured a warrant for his arrest for
"Jumping" a board bill. Deputy Sheriff
W. F. Ornbaun went down to the dry.
but failed to find his man. A few days
later he tried it again, and yesterday af
ternoon he arrived in Uklah with Mohr in
charge. The deputy found him in Golden
Gate Park, and when he attempted to
serve the warrant Mohr grabbed it and
tore it in two. The deputy knocked him
down, and. after a severe tussle in which
.both rolled on the ground, succeeded in
handcuffing him.
Deputy Ornbaun first got upon the trail
of Otto by shadowing a married woman
Jn San Francisco who had been receiving
letters from him while he was here. Otto
is now playing "seven up!' with the pris
oners in Jrill. and awaiting a "remittance"
before making his plea.

Assents â¢ to the Formation of a Com
pany to Extend the Harbor at
Lorenzo Marques.
BERLTN. Dec. 12.â The Neueste Nach
richten says it learns a new Anglo-Portu
guese agreement has been made under the
terms of which Portugal gives Great
Britain a free hand in settling the ques
tion concerning the Netherlands railway.
It consents to the principle of Great Brit
ain administering the Portuguese section
of that railway, and also assents to the
formation of a new Anglo-Portu
guese company for a considerable exten
sion of the harbor at Lorenzo Marques.
The company will be empowered to raise
harbor dues on an agreed scale, paying
15 per cent thereof to Portugal, which ac
cordingly will not levy transit dues on
goods consigned to the Transvaal.
The paper gives details of two exist
ing German harbor extension schemes
which some time ago were deferred at
Portugal's instance, owing to Great Brit
ain's protest in virtue of her pre-emption
rights at Lorenzo Marques, but the Ger
man concessions were confirmed in 1899
by Portugal and ; ; Great Britain. If the
new agreement does not Infringe on these
concessions: Germany will have no
grounds for protesting against the new
harbor extension scheme.

Judge Austin resides at 311S Figueroa

house. Judge Austin, who is well along
in years, was fitting in the dining room

back to a side dcor. openinp into the yard.
Besides the ordinary door there is a
screen door on the outside, and the
Judge's attention was arrested by a sound
as of somebody working at the screen
door. He had heard no sound of footsteps
on the steps leadinp to the door, but when
there came a distinct tap on the screen
Judge Austin partly opened the inner door
and demanded to know who was there.
Receiving no reply, he opened the door
wider, fully exposing himself, and at the
same time half turning so that he stood
sideways in the aperture.

DO NOT FORGET THAT
This year's Christmas edition of The Call will be a gem. It is
safe to predict that it will surpass the effort of any other paper in the
United States. The matter has been selected with the greatest care for
its literary excellence and only the best work of well-known authors has
been accepted to fill the fiction portion of this mammoth edition. There
will be plenty of interesting matter, besides good shcrt stories â but just
listen to a few of the names of our contributors. In the first place, then
is Pauline Bradford Mackie, whose book, "A Georgian Actress," was
justly considered by the critics to be one of the books of the season. She
Â¦writes a charming love story of the x early pilgrim days. Justin McCar-
thy gives an interesting Christmas sketch entitled "His Ideal Christ-
mas." General Charles* King has written his best short story
in "A Shot in Time." John Strange Winter is tlrere with a notable con-
tribution, to say nothing ot.such well-known people as Marion Harland,
Edith Sessions Tupper and Jessie Juliet Knox. This is only a small por-
tion of what will be in
THE CHRISTMAS CAU.
There will also be stories for the children as well as for the grown-
upsâ good, wholesome and 'bright articles written expressly to catch
their fancy. The illustrating has been done by The Call's own special
staff of artists â and it is a recognized fact that The Call Art I>epart-
ment is unequaled. It is sufficient to mention that such names as Meth-
fessel, Dixon, Cahill, Warren, Bradshaw, Kelly, Bronstrup, Thorndyfce,
Borein and Bohrand will appear as signatures on original full-page
drawings of subjects especially selected for suitable Christmas illustra-
tion. The comic side will not be neglected, for George W. Peck will be
in the swim with the funniest story of the Bad Boy's Christmas Joke on
the Grass Widow that was ever told, to say nothing of some full-page
comics that are simply side-splitting. Can you wonder then that we
feel safe in prophesying that of all the Christmas papers published this

Count Andrew Bernstaff, the Court Chaplain to Emperor William I
has written an article on ;' Christmas in the Fatherland," and coming

end of the fourth, as he bored in and had
Neil guessing. An extra round was called
and the boys fought each other to a stand-
Still. At the close of one of the fiercest
rounds seen in many moons, Hanlon was
given the decision. The howl of approval
that went up from the spectators awak

VV y EW . YORK. . Dec. 12.-After try- ,
I N X I Ihg for two days, the National

Young there were present: A. H. Soden. I

The committee appointed by the league
to hoar the grievances of the Players'
Protective Association went Into session
in parlor D. The -oomm'ttee is composed
of Messrs. Rogers, Soden and Brush. The }
players' organization demanded that the
sijFsion be an open one,, which was ac
corded.* When the session began the par
lor was crowded. The meeting was
opened by Mr. Soden* who stated that as !
a result of correspondence between Mr. I
Taylor and the league magnates tne com- I
mittee had bren appointed to listen to the j
demands of the players. The committee,
he said, was appointed last September, i
but for various reasons could not meet
the players' committee until the present Â¦
time. Mr. Soden said that the committee
had no power to act, but would report the j
conference back to the meeting of-^the j
league. . ' '
In stating the demands of tfie players'
organization to the lÂ»apue committee Mr.
Taylor said there w*re three defects In
the present form of contract that the
players wanted correcied. These were a
modification of a reserv? clause, an entire
elimination of the " "farming out" clause
and the modification of ihe clause relat
ing to the power of the club owners to
buy nnd sell players or claim them with
out first Retting the player'n consent. Be
fore he would' consent to present the play
ers' demand to th*Â» league committee. Mr.
Taylor exacted a promise that the com
mittee would report the matter to the
league imrrtediately. and that mmp action
would be taken by the league at its pres
ent session. Mr. Taylor demurred to
treating with the committee at first on
the Kround that it had no power to act.
He asked that the matter be laid over
until It could be presented to a full meet-
Ing of the magnates.
Both Chairman Soden and Colonel Rog
ers* assured Mr. Taylor that the matter
could be expedltiously treated if presented
to the committee.
"This matter Is a serious ore to us."
said Colonel Rogers. "Contracts are nine
tenths of the assets of a club. This com
mittee will make a fair and truthful re
port to the league of what you say to
us."
Mr. Brush said that officially the mem
bers of the league had not been Informed
as to the purpose of*the players' organiz
ation, and they looked upon it as a secret
organization into which many players
playing managersâ had not been taken.
Mr. Taylor denied this. and. nf.ter receiv-
ASSAULTS REFEREE AT THE
CLOSE OF A PRIZE FIGHT
Jim Neil Strikes Harry McGuinness Because
His Son Loses Bout.
Jim Nell, race track gambler and
politician, nearly caused a riot at the
close of the monthly boxing exhibition
given by the Golden Gate Athletic Club
in Washington 8quare Hall last night.
His son was one of the principals in a
hot boxing bout and lost the decision. This
so onraRed the father that he Jumped Into
the ring, and after wildly asking Referee
McGulnness to show him the written de
cisions of the Judges of the contest,
angrily struck the referee. Before he could
follow up his assault spectators Interfered.
McGulnness tried to Bet at his assailant,
but was held back, and later in the dress
ing-room he tried once more to repeat the
blow, but was prevented by friends. Ser
geant Chrlstennen used his club and soon
had the ring: cleared.
Younpr Nell had defeated four opponents
at other exhibitions with ease, and his
father expected great things of him. The
bov has a good left and plenty of pluck,
but last nljrht he received a setback when
he tackled Kddy Hanlon. coxswain of the
Ariel Boating Club. The lads fought one
of the finest battles seen in the jing in
many days. Ilanlon outpointed Nell in th-*
first round. In the second round Xeil did

CHARLES JAMES
UNDER ARREST
Claims Relationship With
the Famous
Bandit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SOMERVILLE, N. J., Dec. ll.-Charles
James, who says he Is the youngest
brother of the late Jesse James of out
law notoriety, waa arrested at Bound
Brook Tuesday, charged with robberies on
Millstone River. James Donnelly, a trol
ley car conductor on the Middlesex Â»ml
Somerset traction line, was arrested on
the same charge when he slopped hid car
at Bound Brook at noon.
Millstone's Vigilance Society decided to
run dovn the thieves who on Thanksgiv
ing til. t stole from its moorings the
steam launch owned by Oeorge Page, the
lawyer, and Charles Vandorf, an en
gineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and
took it down the river to a point near
Weston, where it was stripped of its en
gine, boiler and Â¦ propelling machinery.
Captain Ben Welsh of the vigilantes
called Detective George D. Totten of this
place into the case, and these two offi
cers have since been hunting- for the
thieves. They obtained evidence which
led them to search Donnelly's home in
South Bound Brook. They round in the
floor of his barn a concealed door, which
when lifted revealed the engine stolen
from the launch stored in a pit which had
been flug there. They also found con
cealed In the barn a forty-foot yawl, the
property of George Daveys of Weston,
Â¦which had been stolen from Millstone
River several months ago. The arrest of
Donnelly and James (juickly followed
these discoveries.
Both young men have many friends and
have heretofore been hiprhly respected in
Bound Brook. They first protested their
innocence, but Donnelly broke down and
confessed when confronted with the evi
dence against him. ~ : ' t
NEW YORK. Dec. 13.â With over 14-00
miles clicked off in their pursuit of prizes
In the six day bicycle race at Madison
square Garden, which ends on Saturday,
seven teams were still represented on the
trncl: at midnight, or the beginning of the
fourth day of the contest. The men have
not been able to keep up the hurricane
pace jumped Into at the outset, but they
have struggled to do as much as their
strained and tired bodies will allow them.
For the first two days they were ahead,
of the record, but now they are far be
hind the record of 1S59.
To prevent the loss of a lap, Fisher I
performed perhaps the hardest task of
the race. In the afternoon he got a punc- i
Hire just as the other riders were prepar- i
Ing for a spurt. The other men noticed !
Fisher's misfortune and tried to take ad- i
vantage of It. 'Fisher pedaled along with
the bunch, however, in spite of the soft
enlnK t'.re nnd kept up the pumping or his I
crippled machine for a full mile, at the
end of which time Frederick relieved
him. When Fisher dismounted hla tire
was perfectly flat.
An accident which put Aronson out or ;
the race occurred shortly after 9 o'clock.
Kaser and Ryser were relieving one an
other during a try to gain a lap. going at
a tremendous pace. Gougoltz and Slmnr
were almost behind them, with McFar
land Just on the Inside. The Frenchmen,
who were also alternating, came together!
with a crash nnd went down on the track.
Waller was at their heels and he crashed
Into the fallen Frenchmen. Turville fol
lowed Waller Into the mlx-up and went on I
top of the other bodies. He was thrown
clear of the pile and into a box among a
crowd of spectators. Fisher was the next
man and after riding over the others was
thrown violently to the boards. McFar
land nnd Ryser and Kaser spurted but the
referee, would not allow thelr-gain.
Turville was picked up bleeding and un
conscious, and with a lump on
one knee. He was rushed to bis tent anil
examined. He had sustained contusions
of the right thigh and many bruises of the
bodv as well as the shock. The doctor
broiight him back to consciousness after
a little. Â¦
Aronson had a badly cut eye and face
and bruises on the back. Fisher waÂ« bat
tered and shocked. The two Frenchmen
escaped better than any of the others,
getting only a shaking up.
Aronson was* declared out of the race
at 1 o'clock this morning.
When Babcock heard that his team
mate, Aronson, was sent to the hospi
tal, he declared he would ride â¢ twelve
hours nnd give Aronson a chance to re
cuperate. He kept on his wheel until 1:5>
a. m.. when he fell exhausted. Gougoltz
and "Kaser 'fell on top of him, but none
was seriously hurt. The referee ruled
that- nr. lopsefl should be marked up on
account of the accident.
Turville returned' to the track at la
m.. rode slowly until 1:50 a. in., and then
dismounted. He had to be carried to his
training room. The score at 2 o'clock:

The draw of the Saturday and Sunday
DRAW OF SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY STAKE
Ruby R., 'George Nethercott's speedy
young courser, captured the mldweok re
serve event at Union Park yesterday, hut
paid for the honor of having her name
added to the list of stake Winners with her
life. Â£
Honor Bright was the runner-up in the
stake, and it whs tine to her lack of ef
fort to end the course that Ruby R. was
forced to run a severe final and practically
alone. So far as the getting In to the last
round, Ruby was a bit lucky. The hares
were more than a match for the stake en
tries and from the top of the card long
courses were the rule.
Ruby beat Ripple in the run-down 18 to
4 'and against -Daylight In the second
round^was given'a harder course, 24 to 5,
to raise the flag. This seemed to kill her
chances, but by favor of three byes In
succession the hard-worked greyhound
was advanced to the finaj.
. After her last run Kuuy showed great
distress and had to be carried from the
field. Despite every effort to save her,
she died half an hour later.
Huby R, was by imported Waratah out
of Little Wonder and was a full sister,
by a later litter, of tlie great Whitehead,
the JLopez crack, whose death under like
circumstances was recently recorded.
Nicaeio got well along the card by good
work. Risky Attempt looked like a win
ner, but his, clever performance was offset
by hard going.
The short-ends were: Ploughboy beat
Rollicking Airs at 5 to 1, Safeguard beat
Auckland at 5 to 1 and Kanaka at 4 to 1,
Kibosh beat Controller at 4 to 1, O'Hara.
beat Random Aim at 3 to 1, Annie Law
rence beat Temple, Cecil M. beat Justice,
and Rleky Attempt beat Warco at 2 to 1.
Bowery Boy beat Lady Davenport, War-,
co beat Bell' 1 Rocket, Roslnante beat Bona'

The Board of Education yesterday sur
rendered control of the model school
which has been established in the Le
Conte School building and recalled Miss
Stebbins, who has been In charge since
it opened. The board adopted a resolu
tion tendering the use of the building to
the Trustees of the San Francisco Normal
School at a monthly rental of $1 per year,
the Trustees to maintain the building in
good repair. When the Normal School
Â¦was established the board persisted In as
signing one of Its teachers to assume
charge of the school, which was under the
supervision of the Normal School Trus
tee?. Two hundred pupils attend, and the
Normal School scholars obtain experi
ence in teaching them.
Superintendent Webster protested
against this course and contended that if
the Board of Education retained control
of the school It should assign regular
teachers thereto. Webster was preparing
to force the board to take some action
when it surrendered control to the Normal
School Trustees.
The board appointed Miss M. C. Dowling
as special teacher of Spanish in the com
mercial department of the Lincoln Even
ing School, made vacant by the death of
J Ruiz. Miss Owen Kelly was appointed
to the janitorship of the Burnett Primary
School.
The Sheridan Branch School wa3
ordered closed until the opening of the
spring term on January 7, 1901, on account
cf Illness among some of the pupils.
William W. Fogg was placed on the

pal reform Is watchlnK the practical operation
of the new law. I ehall be pleased to address
you on this subject Friday, and may be able
to enlighten you as to the . results accom
plished, for the press of San Francisco has
found only evil In the new Instrument, partic
ularly that part of the press which was most
strenuous In support of the proposed charter.
L'nder chanced conditions the facts have been
Perverted and the public misled.

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.
What suffering frequently results
from a mother's ignorance ; or moro
frequently from a mother's neglect to
properly instruct her daughter !
Tradition says "woman must suf-
fer," and young women are so taught.
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment, and her mother should see
that Bhe gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion ; but no mother need hesitate to
Â¦write freely about her daughter or
herself to Mrs. Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass.
Mrs. August Pfalzgraf, of South
Byron, Wis., mother of the young lady
whose portrait we here publish, wrote
Mrs. Pinkham in January, 1899, saying
her daughter had suffered for two
years with irregular menstruation â
had headache all the time, and pain in
her side, feet swell, and was generally
miserable. Mrs. Pinkham promptly
replied with advice, and under date of
March, 1899, the mother writes again
that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cured her daughter of all
pains and irregularity.
Nothing- in the world equals Mrs.
Pinkham's frrent medicine for regu-
l.itincr woman's peculiar monthly

MOROCCO AND OURSELVES.
WHILE the country is without a single dissent
ing voice' supporting President McKinley in
all he is doing to obtain from Morocco re
dress and indemnity for the murder of an American
.citizen in that country, it is worth while to remember
the President is also trying to grant redress to Italy
for the murder of certain Italians by lynch law in this
country. Consistency requires that we should give
him as much support in the one case as in the other.
In his message to Congress the President, after re
viewing the killing of the Italians by a mob and the
failure of all efforts to bring the guilty parties to jus
tice, said: "I renew the urgent recommendations I
made last year that Congress appropriately confer
rpon the Federal courts jurisdiction in this class of
international cases where the ultimate responsibility
of the Federal Government may be involved, and I
invite action upon the bills to accomplish this which
were introduced in the Senate and the House." Con
tinuing the same subject, the President added:
"Lj-nching must not be tolerated in a great and civil
ized country like the United States; courts, not
mobs, must execute the penalties of the law. Th-i
preservation of public order, the right of discussion,
the integrity of the courts and the orderly administra
tion of justice must continue forever the rock of
safety upon which our Government securely rests."
We have of course a good claim for redress from
.Morocco. Marcus Ezagui, a naturalized citizen of
this country, was murdered at Fez last June, and a5
the Government of Morocco made no effort to pun
ish the guilty parties or to offer any reparation for
the crime, our Government has a just right to demand
redress and indemnity. We are powerful enough to
send warships to Morocco and compel compliance.
with our demands. Why should not our Government
have an equal power to compel redress for murder of
an alien done by lynch law in any portion of its own
territory?
It is certainly clear from the developments of the
part year that something will have to be done to ar
rest the tendency toward exercise of lynch law in va
rious parts of the United States. The Federal couts
of course could not interfere, except, as the President
points out. in cases where the lynching affects inter
national obligations, but even when confined to such
casrs one or two examples of the punishment of lynch
crs would have a wholesome effect upon the public
mind.
This feature of the President's message should not
be overlooked in the pressure of material interests
before Congress and the country. In fact, the very
efforts we are now making to obtain redress from
fomi-barbarous countries like Morocco and Turkey
ought to have the effect of rousing American senti
mrnt against that relic of barbarism and savagery
which exists among us in the form of lynching.
OF David Bennett Hill it may be slid that, like a
cat, he has nine lives. Just how many times
he has been politically killed we cannot sta'e
; with accuracy, for we have mislaid our tally sheet, but
I it is evident the full number of his lives has not been
j exhausted, for we learn from our New York ex
Â¦ changes that he has come back to politics.
The reason for Hill's return to activity at this time
i is the fight the reformers have started against Croker.
! It is stated that Hill's friends in New York City will
' cordially support the icform committee of fifteen and
I do all in their power to advance the anti-Tammany
: movement. Their efforts, however, will be directed
i rot so much against Tammany itself as against the
j boss. The New York Post says: "They are already
working in several Assembly districts to stir up a re
volt against Croker mlc, and they will join heartily
any movement that promises the downfall of the
boss* of Tammany Hall. Whether they will try to
form another Democratic organization in the city has
not yet been determined. Just now they believe that
co-operation with a citizens' movement is the best
! means of accomplishing the purpose they have in
> view, but later it may be decided that another organi
zation should be formed."
According to some authorities Hill is after biy
stakes. He is fighting not only to revenge the wrongs
of the past, but to prepare a way for future glory.
! Once more aspirations for the Presidency have re
! vived in his breast, and he believes the defeat of Bryan
! has given him an opportunity to gratify that ambition.
To achieve his desire he must have the support of
New York Democracy, but he cannot get that so Ion.-?
as Croker rules Tammany. Hence Mr. Hill has be
come a fierce reformer and has taken to the warpath
i with tomahawk and scalping-knife.
If there be any foundation for these reports the
| question of the reorganization of Democracy is to be
i taken out of the domain of idle discussion and con
j verted into something like a scrapping match. The
first round in the contest will be the attempt to over
; throw Croker's domination in New York, and then,
! if that be successful, there will follow the effort to or-
I nÂ«nize New York City Democracy under a different
â¢ leadership from that of Tammany. Each of thess
contests will be among the liveliest of the coming
year and will start the new century on a red-hot
i career.
Â¦ Not the least interesting feature of the reports \%
'the announcement that Hill is to "make thefight in

The South should quit this game of relying on tht

virulent opposition of its politicians. It is not for
the good of that section or of the country that men of

and Lindsay are rotten-egged out of politic; to mak;
room for weaklings whose ideas have not yet caught

In this emergency Governor Candler. Governor

the South Atlantic seaboard and Gulf must look to
the North and to their political opponents for the

Thomas Jacob of Vlsalia. who is a director of the,CalIfornla Cured Fruit
Association, has found one way of disposing of small and unmarketable
prunos. Mr. Jacob Is a practical and experienced fruit grower, one who
both observes and experiments, and what he has to say is worth listening to.
It has been ascertained that small prunes can be profitably fed to hogs, and
Mr. Jacob has demonstrated that they form an admirable substitute for bar
ley in feeding horses.
When asked by a Mercury representative, "Do you think the small sizes
Cf prunes, above ]20, are worth more than $10 a ton for any purpose?" 1 he
rcpiled:
"Yes, I do. We have fed them to horses for three seasons, feeding once
a day in about the same quantity as if feeding grain, about Tour or five
quarts at a feed, the horses preferring them to barley or rolled Egyptian
corn. They do equally as well as when fed upon grain alone, and I would
prefer to use my small prunes in feeding horses than to tell them at $10 a
ton. I consider them as valuable a feed for horses as I do barley at from
51S to $20 per ton.
"I believe If the fruit growers would make a trial cf using their small
prunes in this way that they would get very satisfactory results and would
be better satisfied than they would In taking the prices they could realize
for thorn in the market. Â¦ ' Â» "
"I think it would be better In ining prunes for feed to have them passed
through a roller which would crush the seeds. I think I have given the
prune a fair trial for this purpose during a period of three years, and can
confidently state that I have found it equal, pound for pound, to barley as
a food."â San Jose Mercury.

Of course a matter of this kind is only a minor is
sue in the stirring affairs that now engage the atten
tion and tax the thoughts of the British people. It
is one of the little things, however, that are likely to
have consequences, and Salisbury may yet have occa
t>ion to regret that he permitted himself such a lar^e
liberty of action when he reorganized his Cabinet.
The assumption of the unconstitutional office is,
however, the least of the innovations made by Salis
bury. In addition to that offense he has arbitrarily
increased to twenty the number of the members oi
the Cabinet, and has appointed members of his own
family to three of the highest offices in it. So large
a Cabinet has naturally excited the distrust of a peo
ple so conservative a; the British, and it is said that
even among members of his own party the action has
been severely criticized. As for the appointment of
so many of his own relatives to office, the public
condemnation has not been as severe as would have
followed had any such action been committed in" this
country, but still it will be remembered that on the
opening of Parliament Lord Rosebery sarcastically
congratulated Salisbury on having so many statesmen
in his family.
Summing up the general objections to Salisbury's
action, a writer in the Fortnightly Review says:
''The Cabinet has become a mob, and when the num
ber of its members has reached twenty it would be
better if it were suppressed. It could not be a gov
erning body if it would. It should not if it could.
Concentration, not diffusion, of personal responsibil
ity is the vital condition of executive efficiency. In
a Cabinet of twenty we have obviously an institution
which has ceased to be an active organ of the body
politic, but the vague tradition of a responsibility,
which it no longer possesses, serves the most mis
chievous purpose possible by concealing from the at
tention of the nation the real depositaries of supreme
power. To say that there is a Cabinet within the
Cabinet merely means that Lord Salisbury can con
sult whom he likes, and that it is incumbent upon him
to consult nobody. When three members of his fam
ily are among his colleague?, the only "inner Cabinet"
that is inevitable is one which perverts the first prin
ciples of sound politics."
Shortly after the reconstruction of the Cabinet the
Court Circular, an official journal, spoke of "the
office of Prime Minister/* ar.d the London Law
Times directed attention to the incident as the first of
its kind on record. Then Mr. Campbell-Bannerman,
speaking at Dundee, referred to the office of Prime
Minister, whereupon the Westminster Gazette, in re
buking him for the use of the term, said: "This is
a great departure from the tradition of the days of
Walpolc, when the peers embodied a protest against
the use of the phrase, 'Sole or first Minister, an of
ficer unknown to the constitution.' At a later day
Lord North always refused to be called Prime Minis
ter, even in private. And it has remained for the
present age and this constitutional Government to
g ; ve official sanction to a phrase which was so odious
to the Tories of an earlier generation."
OUT of the discussion now going on in Great
Britain over the new Cabinet formed by Lord
Salisbury there is coming a good deal of infor
niation that will be new to most Americans. It ap
pears, for example, that there is no such thing known
to the British constitution as the office of Prime
Minister, and yet it is for the performance of the
duties of such office that Salisbury has recently ac
cepted a salary. \

Such are the reports that come from the metropolis.
While the city election is still distant, the various ele
ments of the people r.re rapidly aligning themselves
for the fray, and if Hill intends to take a leading part
in the reform movement we shall soon learn it. Should
he do so it will prove an event of no little interest, for
it would mean a new development in Democracy that
would be of national importance.
the open." It is well known that as a rule the sage
of Wolfert's Roost has made his fights indirectly -and
has preferred to put some one else to the front whil?
he remained in the rear and directed the onset. This
time he has come to the conclusion that he has noth
ing to gain by indirection and nothing to lose by
straight fighting. Evtr since Croker turned him
down at the Kansas City convention he has been
known as a victim of the boss, and has therefore no
reason for any longer hiding in the bush.
We desire to call this matter to the attention of our
members of Congress. While it may seem at first
sight to be a local interest, yet its benefits arc so gen
eral as to fall far beyond our own borders. Califor
nia has become the leading producer and purveyor of
fruit products for all of this country and a consider
: able part of Europe. The Southern States produce the
cotton which keeps the weavers of Lancashire busy
j and clothes three-quaiters of the population of the
, planet. Official attention to such an important pro
1 duction is not in the interest of the producer alone.
! but serves also the far distant weaver and the more
! distant consumer. Precisely so is it with our rural in
! dustries in California, and when they get their share
j oC official attention and assistance their production,
I transmutation and exchange are all benefited.
The State will be th?nkful to Secretary Wilson for
j his good intentions in the matter, and will look to our
! members of Congress to supply the means to niakc
: them effective.
All of these considerations impressed the Secre
Â¦ tary of Agriculture during his visit here two yea's
1 ago. and in his cumin recommendations to Con
i gress. carrying the appropriations asked for to maiu
' tain the work of his department, he asks for a special
i appropriation to be '-pent in giving special attention
; tc the highly individual character of the rural indus
! tries of California.
In addition to this the department, by devotion of
its resources to a study of California conditions, will
help our already established agriculturists and horti
culturists. Vegetable physiology has here a distinct
individuality, and the vegetable pathologists of the
department will find in California a new field for
study. The enemies of all vegetable life, from fungi
tc insects, are here peculiar, individual and distinct.
Remedies that apply to them must be as special. We
recognize in man the liability to diseases that have
climatic origin and limitations. A study of the inter
mittent fevers which are endemic in parts of the Mis
sissippi Valley throws no light on' the yellow fevers,
vomito and other epidemics of the tropical and semi
tiopical regions.
It will he readily seen that if the Agricultural De
partment appreciate this difference in processes and
conditions its Year Book m,ay be made the medium
of specific information of great value to California.
The intending immigrant, with access to that publi
cation, may be informed in advance of-thc novel con
ditions he will find here, and will come with his eyes
open, and equipped with acquired knowledge, which
will prevent many failures and disappointments.
Immigrants who come to us to embark in any of
our ruial industries find it necessary to unlearn all
ihey know of the sane industries elsewhere and ap
1-ly themselves to learning the things made necessary
by our different physical conditions.
It Is readily seen that the arts of agriculture and
horticulture arc quite different in their practice here
from the region lying eastward of us. Seedtime and
harvest, the pruning aiid cultivation of our orchards
and the preparation and marketing of their products.
arc seasons and processes for which Eastern expe
rience furnishes us no guide.
Horn that line westwardly, however, differentiation
begins. Soils and seasons change. The need of irri
gation introduces different method? of farming. When
the Sierra Nevada Mountains are crossed the change
of process and physical conditions is as complete as
if a new continent had been entered. Isothermal lines
are found allying our climate with that of the tropic?,
while at the same time our productions are semi
tropical and north temperate zone. It is found that
the flora of widely divided regions flourish here. The
camphor tree of Formosa and the cinnamon and pi
mento of Ceylon, the rubber tree of the tropics, the
ginger vine of Asia, the licorice plant oi Spain, the
melons of Arabia, the dates of the Sahara, the figs of
Greece, all grow under the same sun and in the same
soil with the grapes of Valencia and the Ionian Isles
and the citrus fruits of Sicily. Alongside of these
exotics we produce the cereals of our own continent,
ami those of the British Isles, Norway and the Black
Sea. and the root crops of France, Asia and Sweden.
UP to this time California has hardly her fair
share of the benefits that follow the establish
ment of the Agricultural Department in the
National Government. Beginning at the ; Atlantic
coast and extending as far west as the ninety-ninth
meridian, the seasons and the processes which pro
duce crops have such features in common that the
investigations, conclusions, information and advice of
the department may fairly apply to all parts of that

season took place yesterday when Miss
Isabel H. Preston and Len Douglas Ow
ens were married at the First Unitarian
Church. Rev. Bradford Leavitt performed
the ceremony, which was witnessed by a
large and fashionable gathering of
friends.
All the details of the wedding were char
acterized by a most artistic arrangement.
Tho church was prettily decorated with
ferns and palms and in a tall vase in the
chancel an immense bunch of American
Beauty roses nodded their pretty heads.
The artistic details of the affair were,
however, most conspicuous in the delight
ful taste displayed in the gowning of the
bridal party. Prettiest of all were the bou
quets of violets fashioned as muffs, and
through which the maids thrust their
dainty hands.
At exactly 3 o'clock, the hour set for
the ceremony, the bridesmaids advanced
from the chancel door and marching down
the center aisle met the bride and escorted
her to tho altar.
In the bridal procession first came the
ushers, Wlllard Drown, George Cadwal
lader, Albion Whitney, Eugene Unger, Dr.
Morton Gibbons and Herbert Mee. They
were followed by the bridesmaids. Miss
Norma Preston, Miss Graco Spreckels.
Miss l.illie Spreckels. Miss Florence Jos
selyn, Miss Ida Gibbons and Miss Grace
Bertz. Following the bridesmaids came
tho maid of honor, Miss Edith Preston,
who in turn was followed by the bride,
learing on the arm of her father.
At the chancel rail the groom, assisted
by the best man, Dr. John C. Spencer,
waited the coming 61 the bride.
The bride wore an exquisite gown of
white satin. The skirt was made en train
and trimmed with a flounce of white crepe
de chine. The corsage was made high and
elaborately trimmed with costly lace. The
veil, whicn was an elegant piece of old
point applique, was fastened to the coif
fure with a wreath of orange blossoms.
The bridal bouquet was composed of lilies
of the valley and orchids.
Miss Edith Preston, the maid of honor,
wore a dainty gown of white mousseline
over white silk. The yoke of the corsage
was laid in tiny tucks, stitched In gold,
und the girdle was made of point applique.
A hat composed entirely 1 of white violets,
and a muff of the same blossoms, com
pleted the exquisite costume. The brides
maids were attlre'd alike. Their gowns
were of pink crepe, trimmed with white
lace. Their flower muffs were composed
of Marie Louise violets ,and their hats
were fashioned to represent pink roses.
After the ceremony there was a recep

Benoit Pasquale, of the firm of B. Paa
quale & Sons, military and society goods,
223 Sutter street, is lying in a critical con
dition at his residence, 971 Howard street,
as the result of an encounter with a bur
glar or robber early yesterday morning.
Although seventy-nine years of age, he
was in the habit of going to business
every morning between 6 and 7 o'clock.
He went as usual yesterday morning, and
while walking upstairs to his office with
his keys In his hand a man made a grab
for the keys and struck him on the head
with some Instrument, probably a ham
mer, inflicting an ugly wound. The old
gentleman fell backward and rolled to
the bottom of the stairs, still holding the
keys in his grasp. He yelled for help, and
his assailant got scared and ran away.
About half an hour later the old gentle
man was found at the bottom of the stairs
by the janitor of the building In a semi
conscious condition. 1 * He was able to tell
the janitor what happened him before he
lapsed Into unconsciousness.
The janitor notified Mr. Pasquale's two
sons, and he was taken home and the
family physician summoned. Owing to the
old gentleman's age the effect of the blow,
fall and shock may result seriously. The
police were notified, and Detective Ryan
Â¦was detailed on the case, but he was un
able to get any description of the man.
Monday the old gentleman lost or had
stolen from him three keys, one being for
the door leading to the store. The lock
on the door was changed, and the suppo
sition Is that the man who found or stole
the keys had attempted to enter the store,
and bplns baffled had waited for the old
gentleman Intending to render him uncon
scious, and by getting possession of the
keys rob the store. The man who com
mitted the crime probably calculated on
his victim falling unconscious on the
stairs, .where ho would be unobserved, In
stead of rolling to the bottom Into view.

THE action of the Board of Public
Works In refusing the Central
Theater a certificate has excited
a great deal of comment in official
circles. Thla unexpected attitude
of the board is taken as an attack upon
the Board of Supervisors, which has al
ready granted the theater a permit.
Everything which It is possible to do and
which the law requires has been done by
BelascÂ«^Hnd Tliall in the construction of
the theater. Tho action of the Board of
Public Works is viewed therefore with
surprise and no reasonable explanation
of it has been given except on the basis
that the Board of Public Works Is striv
ing to discredit Its associate, the Board
of Supervisors.
The Central Theater as It has been
planned and as It nears completion Is
one of the handsomest and safest theaters
in San Francisco. Nearly $50,000 has been
expended upon its construction and it is
perhaps an Interesting fact that more
than $10,000 was? spent under the direction
and supervision of the authorities before
a complaint or objection was suggested.
The outside of the building is made com
pletely of iron and the Inside of corru
gated iron, brick and steel girders so
placed as to afford the greatest security
compatible with beauty of design.
Every modern appliance known to the
construction of great Interiors has been
used. On neither of the floors is there a
single stair, the auditorium being on a
Kenlle slope, which removes even th*
small danger which stairs might involve.
Automatic sprinklprs are disposed in va
rious parts of the house and added se
curity is given by an asbestos curtain.
, As for exits the new theater is amply pro
vided. There are nine in all, three open-
Ing into Market street, two into Central
Park and others into Stevenson street.
Without the slightest difficulty and un
der any stress the house could be emptied
of its people in a very few minutes.
{ Around both floors there is a broad prom
i enade. which in itself is a protection not
afforded by any other theater in town. It
is therefore a profound surprise that the
Board of Public Works has made a pro
test. Not only will the theater be per
fectly safe but it will be one of the hand-
Fomest in the city. It will be finished in
cream and gold and will be most artisti
cally decorated. The front will be made
entirely of brick and stone and will bo
one of the most imposing and artistic
structures on Market street.

Board of Public Works Excites Unfavorable Comment in Official Circles
by Its Protest to the Building* Which Is Now' Nearing Completion
Elaborate Safeguards Are Provided for the Benefit of the Public
Judge Coffey announced In open court
yesterday that William D. Farren, execu
tor of the' will of the late D. D, Fowler,
stood in the light of a defaulter and ab
sconder. and after a heated debate with
M. C. Hassett, Fowler's counsel, the court
suspended Farren's powers as executor
and ordered an Immediate investigation
to definitely determine his whereabouts.
On November 12 last Farren came into
possession of $4000 belonging to decedent's
estate, through a compromise with Mrs.
Fowler, which he held for the other de
visees. Frank D.. D. D. Jr., and Lizzie
Fowler, Nellie Bennett and Kate Farren.
He was ordered to give a oond by the
court, but the next time word was re
ceived from him he was in Seattle. Yes
terday an order directing him to explain
his action was called for hearing, but he
â¢was absent,, and in his place " Attorney
Hassott appeared. Hassett explained thÂ»t
his client was in Seattle and admitted that
his conduct in failing to give a bond was
reprehensible.
Hassett disclaimed all responsibility for
the absence of the executor and Judge
Coffey answered that It was one of the
happy conditions of the lawyer's tempera
ment to be able to cast off responsibility.
Hassett started to reply, but Judge Cof
fey stated that he had talked too much
already. Judga Coffey then suspended
Farren's powers and appointed Frank D.
Fowler special administrator of decedent's
estate.
"I think a bond of $1000 in your case will
be sufficient," said Judge CofTey. address
ing Fowler, "because all that remains of
the estate is in the hands of Farren, and
I am of the opinion that $1000 !s more than
you will ever get from him." ?
Farren was connected with the Insur
ance business In this city for some time
and later went into politics, having been
connected with the Sheriff's office re
cently.

(Concluded.)
Another theory, and the most plausible.
Is that Shakespeare wrote the story of
Marina as it stands In the last three acts
of "Pericles," omitting the prose scenss
and the parts given to Gower; but In
stead of tilling it out :o the full measure
of a five-act play he left it unfinished.
Later it somehow got into the hands of
George Wilkins, who wrote the first two
act3; but the non-Shakespearean parts
of the rest of the play appear to be the
work of another writer, perhaps W. Row
ley, who was a partner of Wilkins In an
other dramatic venture of the same poor
sort. The play thus completed was en
tered (with no author's name) on the Sta
tioners' Registers In lfcOS, but its imme
diate publication was "stayed" and in the
same year Wilkins brought out a prose
version of the story, the title page of
which seems to claim a share at least
In the authorship of the play, being in
part as follows: "The Painful Adven
tures of Pericles. Prince of Tyre; being
the True History of the Play of Pericles,
as It was Lately Presented by the Worthy
and Ancient Poet John Gower." The next
year (1609) a quarto edition of the play
was published with Shakespeare's name
on the title page, but no mention of Wil
kinp. A second quarto followed In ih*
same year and others in 1611, 1619. 1630 and
1635; but the play wa3 not included in tho
folios of 1623 and 1632. though in the latter
year the proprietorship of the play was
in the hands of one of the publishers of
the second folio. The third folio (1681) In
cluded "Pericles" with several plays in
which Shakespeare had little or no share.
It is not easy lo explain all these facts
on any hypothesis, but, to my thinking,
they contlict less with the one I have
here favored than with others that have
been advanced. Professor Herford. the
latest of the editors, objects to this tho
ory Cof an unfinished play of Shakes
peare's completed by other hands) on ac
count of certain defects In the dramatic
pketch extracted from the play by il;.
Fleay. He says that 'a great part even
of 'Marina' itself is only intermittent
ly of clear Shakespearean quality"; that
"it has not, as it stanus, any more than
the 'Pericles' story as a whole, the dra
matic substance, the backbone of Shak-33
peare's most 'romantic' plots," etc.
I may say in reply that the imperfec
tions in "Marina" are such as we might
expect to find in a first sketch as brief as
thisâ much briefer than that in "Timon."
As arranged by Mr. Fleay it contains btit
719 lines out of the 2391 lines in the play
as printed in the Globe edition. This may
explain why the publication of the play
was "stayed" In 160S. Shakespeare may
have been disgusted at the manner in
which his fragment of a play had been
padded out to more than thrice its orig
inal bulk; and this may also have led hid
friends who edited the first folio to omit
"Pericles," though they included "Ti
mon" and "Henry VIII," in which he had
a larger share, and also the early plays
("Titus Andronicus" and "Henry VI"),
which he was known, io have revised.
The theory which Professor Herford
adopts, "that Shakespeare rather elab
orated another man's 'Pericles,' scene by
scene, here more, here less, according to
the fluctuating attractions of the scene."
seems to me extremely improbable. I can
not conceive of his leaving the wretched
opening acts with no revision (or none
worth mentioning that the advocates of
this theory can plausibly make out), and
then beginning the third act with what
Professor Herford himself aptly describes
as "one of the most amazing transitions
in literature, suddenly steeping us In the
atmosphere of high poetry." and in the
rest of the scenes which are ascribed to
him seldom falling below this elevated
style characteristic of his latest work.
It is an interesting and significant fact
that Tennyson's poetic instinct led him to
recognize Shakespeare's share in "Pericles"
long before the discussion of the question
in the New Shakespeare society in 1S47.
Dr. Furnlvall, when talking with the poet
about Shakespeare, remarked that he had
never read "Pericles" through, for he did
not believe that Shakespeare wrote it.
"Oh," said Tennyson, "that won't do. He
wrote all the part relating to the birth
and discovery of Marina and the recovery
of Thaisa. I settled that long ago. Come
upstairs and I'll read it to you." Upstairs
to the smoking room they went, and Ten
nyson read the genuine part of "Pericles"
with an occasional triumphant interjec
tion of 'Isn't that Shakespeare? What do
you think of that?" Furnivall. in telling
the story to the New Shakespeare so
ciety, adds: "I need not tell you how I
enjoyed the reading, or how quick and
sincere my conviction of the genuineness
of the part read was." He afterward
found when Mr. Fleay printed what he
regarded as Shakespeare's part of the
play that it was identical with what Ten
nyson had read. Fleay had come to his
conclusions by the application of metri
cal tests and a minute examination of the
construction and style of the play. He

THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
As in the case of the plays already con
sidered, various theories concerning tho
rtouiile aurhrrshir* <>t "Henry VIII" havti
been proposed. Some critics think thai
it was an instance of collaboration; but It
is more probable, as the majority believe,
that Fletcher completed an unfinished
play of Shakespeare's. Three or fo;;r
take the pround that Shakespeare was th*
sole author: one (Robert Boyle, in a
paper printed in the "Transactions of thÂ«
New Shakespeare Society" for 1SS0-5) ar
gues that the play was written by
Fletcher and Massinper, and that ShaUe
ppeare had nothing to do with it. Pro
fessor Herford inadvertently gives the im
pression that Boyle makes Shakespeare
and Massinger the authors. Â¦
Sidney Lee is inclined to ascribe "Wolsey
famous "Farewell" to Shakespeare; but.
as Dowden says: "It la certainly Fletch
er's, and when one has perceived this, on-?
perceives also that it was an error ever
to suppose it written in Shakespeare' a
manner." J
"The Two Xoble Kinsmen, according ta
the title page of the earliest known edi
tion (1634), was "written by the venerabl 3
worthies of their time. Mr. John Fletcher.
Mr. William Shakespeare, Gent.." but it
was not admitted to any of the folios, nr-r
to any other collected edition of Shake-
Bpeare until about fifty year3 ago. Some
what earlier in the present century cer
tain critics began to suspect a double au
thorship, and Lamb and Coleridge. amon-T
others, decided that the old title page waj
correct in assigning a share in the work
to Shakespeare. In 1S33 William Spaldins?
published an elaborate analysis of the
play, allotting to Shakespeare and Fletche â¢
their respective portions, and Hallanrt.
Dyce and other critics and commentators
became converts to his views. Dyce in
cluded the play In his edition, as Hudson
did in his second edition, and as I did in
mine. But Spaldlr.g in lÂ«40 â¢â¢Â¦weak<>nÂ»d"
considerably in his opinions concerning
the play, and later declared the problem
of its authorship insoluble. Other critics
who at first agreed with him have had a
similar experience. For myself at present
I think it very doubtful whether Shake
speare had anything whatever to do wit:i
the play. Sidney Lee, however, in his
"Life of Shakespeare" (1S9S) decides that
"frequent signs of Shakespeare's work
manship are unmistakable." Some critic*
are of the opinion that Masslnger wrote
the parts that have been assigned to
Shakespeare.
I cannot take space to refer to disputes
concerning the authorship of certain
scenes or passages, longer or shorter, in
plavs included in the ordinary editions of
Shakespeare. These would furnish suf
ficient material for another paper as Ion?
as this, but they are of minor importance
in comparison with thÂ« questions involv
ing larse portions of playa, such as hav?
been discussed briefly In the present
paper. W. J. ROLFE.

had looked at the play as a critic â from
the outside, we may sayâ Tennyson as a
poet, from the inside.
"Henry VIII" 13 another play which 13
Shakespeare's only in part. He wrote
about half of It. and John Fletcher wrote
the other half. Two critics, working in
dependently, divided the play between tho
two authors in the Â«ame manner, assign
ing certain scenes to Fletcher and others
to Shakespeare, on account of differences
in the versification and diction; an't a
study of the dramatic treatment and char
acterization by these and other critics
led to precisely the same results. Mr.
James Speddins. who was the first (1SW>
to discuss the question at length, and to
divide the play in this manner, afterward
stated that the r-v ambiance to Fletcher'9
style in parts of the play was pointed
out to him several years before by Tenny
son; and it is a curious fact that Ralph
Waldo Emerson, In his Ucture on ShaUes
peare (published In 1S30 before he could
have seen the articles by Spedding and
Hickson. the other critic who had divided
the play, and written several years before
it was published), also noted the evidences
of two hands In "Henry VIII." He says
after referring to Malone's discussion or
the double authorship of "Henry VI":
"In Henry VIII" I think I see plainly
the cropping out of the original rock on
which his (.Shakespeare's) stratum wa<*
laid. The first play was written by a
superior, thoughtful man with a vicious
ear. I can mark his lines, and know well
thoir cadence. See Wolsey's soliloquy and
the following: .Â«cene with Cromwell.
where, instead of the meter $t Shakes
peare, whose secret is that tae thought
constructs the tune, so that rraciins for
the sense will best brins out the rhythm,
here the lines ere constructed on a given
tune, and the verse has oven a trace of
pulpit eloquence. But the p'.ay contains,
throuph all its length, unmistakable traits
of Shakeppeare'3 bund, and some passages
are like autographs.'"
The passages which Emerson ascribes to
the "man with a vicious ear" are all
among those which Spedding and others
decide to be Fletcher's. People with no
ear â or ear? too long â may sneer at verse
tests as they please; but when poets like
Tennyson and Kmerscn come to the samo
conclusion as the "meter-mongers" and
other critics, we may safely assume that
these conclusions are probably correct.

THE LITTLE SICKNESSES
Which. Grow Into Big Ones.
A little cold in the hrad is a trifle, but if
neRlftcted and it hangs on from week to
week and pets into the throat and lungs it
is no longer a trifle. It is then no longer
a slight cold but the beginning of chronic
catarrh.
Do not make the mistake of thinking you
have no catarrh because the head and
nose appear to be clear. If'there is cough,
tickling in the throat, hoarseness or a
sense of oppression in the chest you have
throat ana bronchial catarrh. If the ap-
petite is poor, nausea, gagging and dis-
gust for food, especially in the morning,
you have catarrh of the stomach.
The surest and safest treatment for
every form of catarrh is an internal rem-
edy which acts especially on the blood
and mucous membranes.
Such a remedy is the new catarrh cure,
sold everywhere by druggists under name
cf Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a medicine in
pleasant, convenient tablet form and con-
taining all the best and latest specifics for
catarrh, whether located in nose, throat
bronchial tubes or stomach.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
of Sanguinaria. guaiacol. Red gum and
similar antiseptics which destroy the
germs of catarrh In the blood, and no one
who suffers from any form of catarrh and
has Feen the uselessness of sprays,
douches, and powders will ever go back
to them after once trying so convenient,
pleasant and harmless a remedy as
Stuart's Catarrh tablets and one which
gives relief in so short a time.
Even in cases when. 1 catarrh has af-
fected the senses of smell and hearing,
these tablets accomplish a cure -because
the blood being cleansed of catarrhal
germs, the mucous surfaces ofUhe none
and throat no longer clog up the respira-
tory passages with catarrhal secretions.
AH druggists sell full sized treatments of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for the nominal
price of 50 cents, and the regular daily use
of them will effectually cure this trouble-
some and dangerous disease.

Chicago was a shade lower on unfavorable
cables. The demand was moderate. Later on
there was some buying from the Northwest
and some outside support. Commission houses
eold more or less. Offerings were small. There
was a decrease in pressure on account of slow
ly decreasing stocks. Minneapolis wired a
probable Increase of S00.000 bushels, as com
pared with an Increase of 77,000 last Monday.
December State reports were published as fol
lows: Kansas, 99.7, with an Increased area
of 7 per cent; Ohio, 81; Michigan, 82; Illinois,
93 to 102, with 10 per cent less area.

Gaa and Electric advanced sharply from
$45 75 to {47 25 on the morning session of the
Bond Exchange under cctlve sales. The other
stocks stood about the same. â¢
I fact that as yet money rates have not ex-
I ceeded 0 per cent ar.J that to-day the highest
figv.res made was 54. which tapered off to 4
per cent before the clobe. rendered speculators
I less uneasy. With th-i absorption by the sub
1 treasury on Internal revenue collections and
transfers to the Interior the banks thus far
this week have lost $3,200,000. Rates for ex
change continued to yield, sixty-day bills de
cllr.ln* 'i per cent. It is understood lhat the
question of imports of gold is being considered
by a prominent Institution on the basis of al
lowing Interest on the money while in transit.
With this relief apparently In sight should
conditions become stringent in the money mar
ket fpec-ulative i>ools became active and forced
considerable covering of short lines. The mar-
Icet for Americans abroad was described as
buoyant and the arbitrage houses bought about
33,000 shares on balance for London. This de
mand was primarily responsible for the weak
ness In sterling exchange rates as offerings
of commercial acceptances were only moderate.
At the outlet of business the coal stocks were
the principal features and generally got well
above last night's cloee on an enormous de
i mand. Th?Â«=e pronertlvs later on showed the
effect of heavy realizations. Heavy buying ;
developed in the slow stocks owing to en- j
couraglng reports of the trade outlook. Tin
plate made the extreme rise of 276, but Steel
and Wire was the most active and a good
second with a gain of 24. There was very
I heavy buying at intervals In the grangers,
! and some of the Southwestern stocks. During
j the early afternoon after the foreign buying j
I had ceased the demand showed signs of ex
haustion and prices were Inclined to yield. In
I the final hour a raid Â¦Â«vas made on Tennessee
Coal and the stock broke 4% on a rumor that
the directors were in session and had passed J
the quarterly dividend on the stock. This :
unsettled the entire market and prices fell
away rapidly, averaging a point for the most
prominent railroads and extending to 24 in
the specialties. Tlnplate being most affected.
When It became known that the report of the
dlvlden.i action on Tennessee Ccal was un
founded the Ftock rallie'l 2 points and all other
flocks ivco\ered somewhat, speculation leav
ir.c oTf strong again and active.
HutineFs in bonds wÂ«s very heavy, notable
strength being displayed by Kansas and Texas
i^RUf-j. Total sales, par value, $3,070,000.

Chicago Livestock Market.
The sales for the week In Boston amounted
to 3,845, 600 pounds domestic and 367.0C0 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4,212.800, against a
total of 3,617,500 for the previous week and a
total of 6.661.000 for the corresponding: week
last year. The sales since January 1 amount
to 140,671.400 pounds, against 341.467.77S pounds
for the corresponding time last year.
There is some Improvement to be noted In
the wool market, although prices cannot as
yet be quoted higher. The demand has in
creased somewhat and the business has been
more diversified. The sales are more generally
distributed in the trade, and the number of
manufacturers who have been buying is larger,
but they are operating very carefully. Manu
facturers are talking more hopefully in sev
eral instances and, feel encouraged as to the
ou'.look for the heavyweight season. The cold
er weather has acted as a stimulus, and this
has been accentuated by the tenor of advices
from abroad, where tops have advanced 1@1V4
per pound, and wool markets are generally
firmer.
BOSTON, Dec. 12.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
Boston Wool 'Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. J2.â The principal feature
in the metal trade to-1ay was a further heavy
break at' London, whar-j the tin prices went off
Â£3 10s to Â£116 en the bearish statistical situa
tion and an avalanche of selling orders. On
receipt of this news the local market followed
suit and broke about 325 points to $26 25 and
closed steady but weak. December tin was
offered at 126. Though copper in London de
clined 5s to Â£7 15s the local market remained
quiet, but about steaUv en the basl.s of $17 for
Lake Superior and $16 fi-% for electrolytic and
casting copper. LÂ«ad ruled dull and nominally
quoted at $4 37H, while at London the price
was 2s 6<1 lower at Â£16 6s 2d. Spelter ruled
weak and unsettled at 5 points decline, owing
to an absence of buyers, closing weak at
$4 17%@4 22U. London reported unchanged
prices at Â£18 15s. There was another reaction
in Iron In the English markets, prices dropping
Is Oil at Glasgow to tOs 9d, while Mlddlesboro
dropped Is to 55s. Dormstlc iron markets were
quiet. Pig Iron warrants, $9 50@10 60; foundry.
Northern $15&16, Southern $14 50@15, and soft
Southern $14@15 75.

City Attorney Dow to-day filed suit
against Contractor Fred Peterson and his
bondsmen, the American Surety Company
of New York, to recover the amount of
the bond, $4000, on account of his failure
to carry out Ihe provisions of his contract
for dredging Lake Merritt.
This outcome of the notorious case was
anticipated by a resolution passed by the
council some two months since directing
the City Attorney to endeavor to colltct
damages from the parties responsible for
the lake dredging Job. The complaint spec
ifies that there remains in the lake bed
1S0.650 cubic vards of mud which Peterson
agreed to remove, and that it would cost
the city about $18,000 to tlnish the work.
Accompanying the complaint are maps
prepared by the city's engineer, showing
the untouched area and that which was
dredged to the specified depth of four feet.
The document discloses the fact that even
If the city wins Us suit the taxxÂ«Â»yers will
be out $14,000 If the City Attorney's claims
are maintained.
The contractor claims that the change
of programme was authorised by the
Board of Works on the ground that It was
advisable to remove the entire amount of
mud callei fcr by the contract from those
portions of the lake most liable to filling
up by sediment, and that this was accord
ingly done.

wells."
"The eighteen wells at Alvarado supply
12,000.000 gallons daily." said Professor
Wallace yesterday. "Three times that
number of wells can be sunk at San Lo
renzo without one v.ell Interfering with
another. I believe that a municipal sup
ply can be obtained in sufficient quantity.
The daily consumption of Oakland is now
9.000,000 gallons. If a salt water sprinkling
plant were Installed the reqnired fresh
water supply can be materially reduced.
A municipal plant will solve the great
question of water rates that now is in
flicted upon the city."
The Council has been asked to appoint
an engineer to determine what will be tne
cost of a municipal supply from the Rob
erts property. This land. 3RD acres, Is now
undf-r option of purchase to the city for
$100,000. It is nine miles distant. The sub
ject will be taken up by the fire and water

" 'Not more than conditions had

Whether the recently incorporated Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons can es
tablish and operate a free clinic in con- :
nectlon with its new institution has be- j
come a question of serious consideration
among the doctors of this city, i ne phy
sicians of the regular school who have
become interested in the college are con
fronted by the agreement made among the
practitioners of the three schools of medi
cine which has been in force for threw
years, and provides that no free clinics,
contract nor lodge work shall bÂ« done in j
this city. When that agreement waa
made the thought of a college was not
contemplated. In fact, if such an Institu
tion had been in view the agreement
would have provided for a clinic in con
nection with the institution, for, the phy
sicians say, a college without a clinic
could not be a complete success.
The question is of such grave impor
tance that the Alameda County Medical
Society, composed of the practitioners of
the "regular" school, has taken the sub
ject in hand. At last night's meeting of
the society the matter was given a full
discussion. The physicians declare that
the sÂ»t:lety Is unanimous that the com
pact shall be sustained. There are two
other parties to the agreement, namely,
the members of the homeopathic school
and the physicians of the eclectic branch.
The new college has upon its roll of of
ficers and faculty many of the prominent
members of the regular school' who are
Intensely interested in the success of the
project. It has been incorporated and
Bteps have been taken to commence work
on January 1. In. order to start under
proper auppices the free clinic is deemed
essential. The clinic simply opens the
way for the handling of the sick and
those needing surgical attention who are
too poor to procure medical attention
otherwise. Opponents of clinics base their
opposition largely upon proven abuses of
the Institution. They say many people
amply able to pay for medical attention
take advantage of the clinics to obtain
medical and surgical aid without charge.
Whsn the three schools made their
compact the hemeopaths abandoned a
clinic they had been operating. Xnw the
question arises among the doctors wheth
er the establishment of the clinic in con
nection with the "regular" college will
not be utilized as an excuse by those of
other schools to re-establish clinics. In
other words, fears are expressed that
some doctors who have been chafing un
der the compact will take advantage of
the situation to break the agreement.
The compact was arranged to remedy
what the physicians then s behind it
claimed was a serious-abuse. Those who
favored it were particularly opposed to
the practice that obtained of handling
lodge, work at a minimum monthly fee
per member. .They also opposed the con
tract system whereby physicians made
flat rates much below the ordinary prices
for family services. The agreement was
submitted to committees of the three
schools and was extensively signed by the
physicians. It has been In operation suc
cessfully elnce it went into effect.
Recognizing, however, that those of the
other schools who abided by the agree
ment should be considered the Alameda
County Medical Society has appointed
conference committees to meet the home
opaths and eclectics upon the subject.
The purpose will be to secure if possible
a< modification of the compact, that the
college clinic. may be established..
The officers of the college, are:

OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â The campaign
which has been started by the
Seventh Ward Municipal "Water
Works League for the submission
of a bond proposition for the pur
chase of the Roberts tract at San Lo
renzo has reached a definite point. The
City Council has been requested by reso
lution to incorporate as the leading Item
for the bond election this scheme to pro
vide money for the purpose of estab
lishing a municipal iresh water supply,
with the Roberts property as the basis.
Three artesian wells have been devel
oped on the property. Members of the
league -who have been interested in the
numerous tests of the wells declare that
these wells, with another ten-inch well
near by, have given a daily flow of as
high as 1.250,000 gallons, and under or-
dlnary pressure two of the wells have
given a flow -of 764.000 gallons daily. The
eight-inch well was bored at the expense
of Captain Roberts. The ten-Inch well
was sunk at the cost of the city. 'The
third well of five inches diameter, had
been sunk several years ago by Captain
Roberts and was recently cleaned out for
an experimental test. This well. accord-
Ing to Secretary Charles J. Welch of the
Seventh Ward League, has developed
350.000 gallons daily flow.
Concerning the general conditions Sec
retary Welch says: '. Â¦
"The sinking of the eight-inch well
brought to light gravel and water-worn
rock from a depth of 560 feet, with a
strata of from fifty ff-et upward. * The in
dications showed beyond any question
that here was the bed of a great sub
terranean river. The evidence Is excel
lent that there Is an Inexhaustible sup
ply of clean pure water here available.

Brahms Quartet was originally com

Ralph Phelpa, pecond tenor: Ralph Mc-
Cormlck. first ba5Â«: William McDonald,
second basn; Clark Briggs. pianist: El
wood Woodburn. banjoist; Hugo Poheim,
violinist. Of this number the only men
now in college are Phelps. McCormick and
Briggs.
It was the original intention of Brahms
Quartet to start pouth the day after
Christmas. Some, of* the members have
dropped out and othcrE are undecided
whether or not to eo. Morse said thl3
evening that three or four eood men
would make thÂ«Â» trip. Neither Phelps nor
Rriggs was positive that any one would
go.
Morse promised to take the men on a
trip through Southern California this va
cation under the name of the California
Entertainers. A maiority of the mem
bers of the Glee Club expressed their
willingness to go. Then the student ex
ecutive committee took action. It pre
sented a memorial to President Wheeler
asking him to prohibit students from go
ing on the proposed vacation concert
tour. It was at this time that President
Wheeler ended the career of the Califor
nia Entertainers by raying the few words
regarding the non-return to college of
student singerB.
Instead of a chorus Morse found him
self with a quartet, some musicians and
ppeeialty men. Tbe Berkeley quartet was
promptly organized aji-d an advance agent
was sent south to make dates for the ap
pearance of the men. Again the execu
tive committee took action, declaring that
the name "Berkeley Quartet," like "Cali
fornia Entertainers." would lead the peo
ple to believe that the concerts were
given by a real university club. Morse
was Bent for by the committed. The
terms of agreement by which students
might go and come were thesÂ«: Morse
changed the name of his club from
Berkeley Quartet to Brahms Quartet,
after the famous composer. He also
agreed in no way to use the university
name.
No Glee Club will go on the road this
winter to charm the inhabitants of the
State. Neither will an organization of
student Binger 1 ? under a new name leave
Berkeley, for President Wheeler Is quoted
a? Faying: "You may go out If you
choose, but vou may not come back."
These few words have a slsrrilflennt mean
ing to a man who hopes come day to
be a graduate of the StAte University.
When the executive committee appoint
ed William Black as director of the Glee
Club its members refuted to sing. They
declared they would have C. R. Morse
as director or none. Black never held a
rehearsal.
BERKELEY, Dec. 12.â The munie cir
cles of the University of California are
being restored to jx>ace. Although the
revolt in the Glee Club has never been
fully adjusted yet it Is generally con
ceded that next term will find its mem
ber* Flnglnp together once more In har
mony. The revolters dropped one by one
from the insurgent ranks. There was a
general feeling- among them that'aXter all
they had best abide by the ruling of the
student executive committee. Then, too,
their ardor for libeny may have been
cooled by some words which President
Wheeler is quotul as saying regarding
student singers.

CITY'S WATER RATE QUESTION
A lively row at the Morgue about the
body of Antonio Galindo led to-night to
the arrest by Deputy Coroner Henry
Quellen of George McMasters. an under
taker's assistant for James McManus.
Ill feeling has existed for a long time
between McManus and the Morgue Of
flclalfe. The latter claim that the under
taker has frequently taken possession of
Coroner's cases and embalmed them be
fore official inspection had been held. The
undertaker asserts that he has been un
necessarily hampered In the pursuit ot
his calling by dilatory practice at the
Morgue. " ':â¢
However all that may be, there was a
hot clash this morning in the Morgue, and
to-night McMasters had charges of as
sault with intent to do great bodily harm,
using vulgar language and disturbing the
peace registered against him at the City
Prison. i. ; ,
Quellen asserts that the trouble was due
to McMasters' attempt to embalm the
body of Galindo before art autopsy could
be held. , .
At the Inquest to-night in the case of
Galindo the Jury found that David Clear
caused Galindo to fall by having pushed
him away as he threatened to assault
Clear with a pocket knife. George
Wright, a boy who saw the difficulty, was
the principal witness before the Coroner's
Jury. Dr. R. T. Stratum testified that
death was caused by a fracture of the
skull and cerebral hemorrhage.

Prisoner Makes Bold Break for Free
dom at Spokane.
SPOKANE. Wash., Dec. 12.â While
Judge Marshall was holding a preliminary
hearing of Edward Hanson, charged with
counterfeiting, this afternoon, the prisoner
quietly arose and sneaked out of tho
room. Owing to the small courtroom be
ing crowded the escape was not noticed
until the Judge turned to announce that
the prisoner would be held to answer. Of
ficers started in pursuit of Hanson, â¢who
was tracking for the river. A few shots
were fired from revolvers and he gave
himself up. Tho escape was the boldest
ever known in the city. Hanson is one of
the trio recently arrested with bogus
mftney In their t>ossespton. A search of
their cabin resulted in the finding of molds
and other tools.
WALKS FROM COURTROOM.
Seems to Still Sold the Balance
of Power.
LOUISVILLE, Dec. 12.-To-day's ses
sions of the American Federation of La
bor apparently disclosed the fact that
there will be little or no opposition to the
re-election of Samuel Gompcrs as Presi
dent.
Two propositions, the votes on which
may be regarded as tests, resulted in de
cisive triumphs for the ideas advocated by
Mr. Gompers. Max Hayes of Cleveland
led the opposition in both instances, but
the battle did not at any time become
personal or bitter. One of tho resolutions
was to limit the term of the federation's
president in the future to two years: the
other provided for tho election of the of
ficers of the body by the initiative and
referendum, instead of a vote In mass
convention on the last day of the annual
session as prevails at present. Both were
defeated. The contest for next year's
c nvcntlon appears to He between Mil
waukee and Scranton, Pa.

SALT LAKE. Dec. 12.â A special to the
Tribune from "VVhite Reck, Utah, says:
This has been a day of excitement at the
Uintah agency, find late this afternoon,
acting upon information of the Indian po
lice that threats had been nmdo to burn
the school luiiliings, Agent Myton re
quested Major Hughes, commanding at
Fort Duchcsne, to send assistance. Jn re
sponse. Lieutenant â Pearson with sixty
men of Troop K, v/ere en the way at 6
O'clock.
At least thirty of the children in the
school are down with measles and other
diseases, and their parents have boen
much dissatlslied because the children
were not allowed to so home. The climax
was reached when one of the Indian fami
lies learned that a daughter of the house
had died tiurliifr the niRht.
Black Hawk n?nde it his business to go
to the school this morning am! demand
the release of his children. O'Connor, a
teacher, made Eomn show of resistance,
and was thrown down stairs and the chil
dren taken away by force. Several other
children were taken away by other In
dians. Agent Myton called a council and
informed the Indians that it was danger
ous to move the children while sick, but
they said they would take all the respon
sibility.
The prompt action of Agent Myton has
put a Ktopto an insurrection that certainly
would have been serious if not disastrous
to the lives of' the whiles and to the Gov
ernment property, which, for a time at
least, would have been at the mercy of
the redskins.

129 Kearny StreetCHICAGO. Dec. 12.â By a decision of
Judges Tuley, Dunne and Waterman of
the Circuit Court, to-day, section 1 of the
anti-trust law of Illinois, which defines
what constitutes a trust or combination
in restraint of trade, ls declared unconsti
tutional.
Other sections of the law, and especially
those which compel corporations to file
affidavits annually with the Secretary ot
State that they are in no way connected
with trusts or illegal combinations, and
providing for a fine of $50 In case of re
fusal to file such affidavit, are sustained
by the court Cases against over S00 Il
linois corporations which have refused to
file affidavits with the Secretary of State
are affected by to-day's decision of the
court. The court in rendering its decision
overruled the demurrers of the defendants
and hold the anti-trust laws valid in the
point at issue.
The decision of the court in respect to
section 1, however, is regarded by the at
torneys for the defense as a distinct vic
tory for the corporations and is looked
upon as nullifying the anti-trust law of
the State in its most vital part.
Tax Suits Instituted.
Suit was filed yesterday by the city and
county against Wells, Fargo & Co.'s

hand, has sued the city to recover $12.

last evening. "I gave the public the bene
fit of my ideas when they were new, and
I am pleased to note that some women, at
least, are sensible enough to follow them.
I don't care , to. pose as a reformer, how
ever. I detest that name. Some people
seem to think that woman is capable of
having but a single idea. They Imagine
all I talk about* is shirt waists and loose
fitting jackets. On- the contrary, I sel
dom discuss these subjects now, . prefer
ring to speak on questions that are new
and which will be helpful to womankind.

ON A LECTURING TOT7B
The question of preserving the forests
of the State will be brought before the
next Legislature by the California Club.
There will be no appropriation asked for,
and no request will be made that the
State provide new offices for any one. The
only request will be that the State
through its legislators indorse the move
ment, and with that indorsement the
club will carry the matter to Congress,
where the real work will have to be done.
It is hoped by those in charge of the mat
ter that the Indorsement of the Legis
lature can be obtained soon enough to al
low of the matter being brought before
the present Congress.
In anticipation of the request for in
dorsement Mrs. Lovell White, president of
the California Club, has sent out circulars
to every part of the State setting forth
the Ideas of the club in the form of a
resolution and asking for signatures. So
far signatures which represent Â£5,000
voters have been received and more are
constantly coming in. The circular sent
cut is as follows:

The recounting of the ballots in the con
test instituted in behalf of Judge William
R. Daingerfield of the election of Thomas
F. Graham to the Superior bench began
yesterday before Judge Murasky. Dur
ing the day the ballots of the First Pre
cinct of the Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict were counted, and at the close Daln
perfield had made a net gain of three
votes. Dainperfield lost three votes and
Graham lost six. making the total as
statt-d.
When the case was called for hearing
the court confirmed the appointment or
James L. Holland to the position of tally
clerk. Fred R. Butz caller. Ray Gallagher
assistant tally clerk and James W. Wag

closed. The burglar had evidently started
to search that first, and when he heard
Adele coming up the stairs he emptied the
ring box into his hand and closed the cas
ket before he tried to hide himself. It
was evidently his intention to get under
the bed, but there were too many boxes
there, and he, could do no more than
crouch into a corner. It was found, too,
that he had taken a diamond ring belong
ing to Adele and also two ladles' watches.
The description of the burglar given by
Adele shows him to be a tall man young
and clean shaven, with a derby hat and
dark clothes, and a soft shirt. The child
was as cool as a veteran, and took a good
look at the man "while she had the chance.
The rings stolen included one diamond
solitaire, a turquoise set with diamonds,
a diamond marquise, an emerald and dia
mond and a ruby and diamond, all valua
ble rings, besides a small ring of coral and
a small diamond ring belonging to Adele.
The police are hopeful of getting back all
the rings and also the watches, as all
can be easily recognized.
Mrs. Steinman and Mrs. Donau are very
proud of the courage shown by the little
girl, and they ere glad she had presence

you do I'll shoot you," and he reached
for his back pocket.
"I won't say anything," said the child,
and the man turned and started for the
back stairs. She had a good look at him
while he was leaving 1 the room, and she
says she will know him again if she sees
him.
As soon as the burglar left Adele ran
through the dressing room and told her
aunt and her grandmother that there was
a man in the house. Mrs. Donau at once
went down into the basement to call the
two Japanese servants, but she believes
the man was out of the house long before
she got down stairs. The family was not
sure, however, that the man had gone, so
one of the ladies went over to a grocery
on the corner and telephoned for the po
lice. In a few minutes three policemen
arrived, and they searched the house
thoroughly but found no trace of the bur
glar.
It was at first thought by Mrs. Donau and
Mrs. Steinman that the man had been
surprised by the child before he could lay
his hands on anything of value, but soon
Mrs. Steinman missed several of her
rings, which she had placed In a little
ring box that was kept in a Jewel casket.
The casket was on her bureau and was

A j\ noon and succeeded In getting
away with $S00 worth of Jewelry.
| The robbery was committed under clr
! cumstances that prove the burglar to be a
i man of exceptional nerve.
The parlor was filled with guests, the
i servants were in their rooms downstairs,
one of the children was taking a music
lesson in the back parlor and Mrs. Donau,
j her unmarried daughter and one of her
grandchildren were in a room on the sec
end floor when the burglar entered the
house and made his way upstairs to one
of the bedrooms. He was discovered by
Adele Steinman, a child of 10 v and, after
warning her to pay nothing about his
presence, he quickly made his way down
stairs again and got away.
The house is one of a row on the east
side of Franklin street, between Suttor
and Bush. Fern avenue cuts the block in
two from east to west, and from Fern
avenue to Bush a narrow alley runs be
hind all the houses of the row. The back
gate leading from 1452 into the alley
was open, and it is believed that the bur
glar entered through it. It was through
that gate he got away. The house is oc
cupied by the family of Mr. Donau, in
cluding his daughter, Mrs. Steinman, and
her children.
Little Adele had Just come home from
school, and. as was her custom, she went
bounding up the stairs to her mother's
room, which opens from the upper hall
lust at the head of the stairway. The
bed ls to the right of the door, and, as
the child entered she saw the top of a
derby hat in between the bed and the
wall. She thought it was an expressman
who was trying to shove some heavy
package under the bed, so she made no
remark, and started for a door leading

the front room where her aunt and her
grandmother were sitting. She had
reached the door when the man rose from
where he was crouching and came threat

WOMAN CAUSES
LUCAS' ARREST
Private Detective Accused
of Impersonating an
Officer.
Miss Lizzie Clarkson, a Minister's
Daughter, Formerly of Topaka,
Gives Public a Peek at the
Family Skeleton.
A. L. Lucas, a private detective, was
arrested yesterday on a warrant sworn
out by Miss Lizzie Clarkson. who charges
him with impersonating an officer of the
law. The arrest of Lucas has been the
means of exposing a full-fledged family
skeleton that ought to be securely locked
away in a closet of Rev. J. F. Clarkson's
home in Topeka, Kan.
Miss Clarkson claims that Lucas came
to the home of Mrs. Warner, with whom
she is stopping at 2020 Folsom street, and
explaining that he had far more author
ity than an officer in regulation uniform,
demanded that she come to his office at
906 Market street. Obeying Lucas' com
mands, Miss Clarkson said she went to
the detective's office, where he put to her
many Insulting questions.
Lucas denies the charges lodged against
him, and says that he never represented
to Miss Clarkson that he was an officer
of the law.
â¢M was employed," he said, "by Miss
Clarkson's family, who wish her to re
turn to her home in Topeka. Her two
sisters, Mrs. Mabel Ackerman and Miss
Lillian Clarkson, are at present in this
citj, the object of their visit being to try
and see if tney could not get their sister
to return to her family.
*tL i famll y claims that the Warners
exercise an undue Influence over her and
nave induced her to follow them from
lopeka to Ottawa, from there to Denver
anu from Denver to this city. A man
i.amed Perry Flattery, who is a member
t the , Var ner household, figures in the
objections entered by the gin's relatives.
t . , , e ,, char^ es made by the family of
Lizzie Clarkson there is mention of hyp
notism, charms and an evil talisman,
Mrs. A\ arner, who has been the girl's con
stant companion for the past five years,
they claim, exercises an hypnotic Â¦ influ
h"r e -m^ 1 " heI " and ls holdin S her against
Miss Clarkson scarcely looks like a
woman whom any one might detain
against her will. She ls very positive in
ail the statements she makes, and fore
most among these statements ls the one
that she will not return to her people.
"lhey never treated me kindly," she
said, "especially my mother. She always
mistreated me and always singled me out
to vent her displeasure upon. She ac
cused me of all sorts of terrible things
and acted in such an unnatural way that
1 decided to leave my home forever, ilrs.
Warner has been extremely kind to me,
and has always treated me as a member
of her family."
In speaking of her family. Miss Clark
son declared that she had no love for any
of them; that they had no love for her
and that she never would return to them.
As to Flattery, Miss Clarkson is extreme
ly indignant at the way her family has
chosen to link their names.
"I have been engaged to Mr. Flattery,"
she said, "for nearly two years. At pres
efcÂ£ he is ill and cannot work, but Just
as soon as he gets back to work we shall
be married."
Mrs. Warner, who has been accused of
hypnotizing the girl from Kansas, is-wild
ly Indignant at the way the members of
the Clarkson family have treated her.
"The idea that I have hypnotized Lizzie
Is preposterous," she said last night. "I
was sorry for her and I tried to do all
I could for her. Her family has also said
that I am a spiritualist, but that is false.
I am a Catholic in good standing with my
church, and no one can say one word
i against my character."
The peculiar part about all this family
row is that Miss Clarkson is 28 years old
and has been away from home for more
than five years, during which time mother
and sisters have never made any attempt
to get her to return home. Now they are
prepared to try every means that law
may give them to induce her to do so.
"Have I fallen heir to a vast estate that
they are so anxious to have me?" That
is the question Miss Clarkson is asking.
TOPEKA. Kan., Dec. 12.â (Special.)â
Lizzie Clarkson's father. Rev. J. F. Clark
son, is a resident of this city. He has not
been actively engaged in ministerial work
for a number of years. He is about 65
years of age. and supports himself and
his family on the income from a small
book and stationery business which he
conducts here. He absolutely refused to
be interviewed to-night on the subject of
the trouble between his daughters In San
Francisco. Mrs. Clarkson, the mother of
the daughters, would say but little on
the subject. She said she thought her
daughters already had enough notoriety
as a result of their quarrel. She claimed
that a woman with whom Lizzie has been
friendly since she went to San Francisco
is the instigator of the trouble. She re
fused to give this woman's name, but said
that Bhe would be properly punished be
fore the trouble was settled. Mrs. Clark
son said that the claim made by Lizzie
that her sisters were persecuting her is
absolutely false, as would be proven by
later developments in the affair. She said
that her daughters had always lived hap
pily together while at home, and was
very sorry that the present trouble had
developed.
The rejection of sir civil service clerks
by Auditor Wells on Tuesday last resulted
yesterday in a corcession to that official
by the Civil Service Commission. The
commission, after an investigation, con
sented to the Auditor appointing three
clerks of his own selection. Seven will be
lumished irom the civil service list.
Mayor Fhelan took a hand in the con
trovtrsy had a conference with the
commission after it had paic 1 . a visit to
the Audiu-r. His Honor objected to al-
Jowirsg the Auditor Jive clerks of his own
s-ek-cuon. lie intimated that if. Wells
should Insist on naming: rive men, he
would use the power vested in him by the
charter to remove any official he consid
ers derelict.
When the Mayor learned that the Audit
or would accept the concession of throe
clerks, he took another tack as retaliation
for what he regards as another attack
en the charter's civil service clause by its
enemies. He expressed his determination,
to recommend next year a reduction of
four in the number of regular clerks al
