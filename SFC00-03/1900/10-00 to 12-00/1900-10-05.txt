BERLIN, Oct. 4.â The text of the note of the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Count von Bulow, to the foreign powers is as follows:
TbÂ» Imperial power Is Informed of an edict of the Chinese Emperor by Sheng, the
Taota.1 of Shanghai, whereby the punishment Is ordered of a number of princes and dlg
r.itaries named fcr having supported, the Boxers. The Imperial Government assumes that
all the other Cabinets concerned have received similar communication. Accepting the au
thenticity of the edict on which we, for our part, do not wish to cast a doubt until evi
dence is received to the contrary, we can perceive in it the flrst sign toward a practical
. bafls for the re-establishment of an orderly etate of things in China. The Imperial Gov
ernment therefore proposes that the powers come to an agreement to Instruct their diplo
matic representatives in China to examine and give their opinion on the following points:
1. Whether the list contained in the edict of persons to be punished is sufficient and
correct ?
2. Whether the punishments proposed meet the case?
3. In what way the powers can control the carrying out of the penalties Imposed?
The lr.fortnation received up to the present concerning the reception of this proposal
fcy th** powers Justifies the belief that a general understanding on this matter may be
looked for.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 4.â Following is the reply of the United States Govern
ment to the German note relative to the punishment of Chinese offenders:
The Kocrrtary of State to the ImixriaJ Gorman Char-e:
MEMORANDUM IX RESPONSE TO THE INQUIRIES MADE OF THE SECRETARY OF
STATE OCTOBER 1. 1300. BY THE IMPERIAL GERMAN' CHARGE D'AFFAIRES
TOUCHING THE CHINESE IMPERIAL, EDICT IN REGARD TO THE PUNISHMENT
OF PRINCE TCA3S AND OTHKP. HIGH CHINESE OFFICIALS.
The Chinese Minister communicated to the Secretary of State on the 2d lnst. a tele
fTB.m received by bin from Director General Sheng, conveying the purport of an Imperial
edict, dated September :;, ISOO, by which the degradation and punishment of Prince Tuan
and other high Chinese is decreed.
Th~ Government of thÂ«> United States is disposed to regard this measure as a proof of
the desire of the Imi^rial Chinese Government to satisfy the reasonable demands of the
foreign powers for the injury and outrage which their legations and their subjects have
luffered at the hands of Â«-vIl-dirposed persons in China, although it has been thought well,
in view of the vagueness of the edict in regard to the punishment which some of the
Inculpated persons are to receive, to signify to the Chinese Minister the President's vlow
that It would be most regrettable If Prince Tuan. who appears from the concurring tes
timony of the legations in Peking to have been one of the foremost In the proceedings
complained or, should escape sneb full measure of exemplary punishment as the facts war
rant, cr if Kav.g Yl or Chao Shu Ch!ao should receive other than their Just deserts.
VÂ»ith a view of forming a Judgment on these points the United States Minister In Pe
king has been Instructed to report whether the edict completely names the persons deserv
ing chastisement, whether punishments proposed accord with the gravity of the crimes
committed, and In what manner the United States and the other power* are to be assured
:hat satisfactory punishment is inflicted.
It is hoped that Mr. Conger's replies to these interrogator!-, will confirm the Govern
ment of the United States in the oulnion which it now shares with the Imperial German
Government that the edict in question U an important initial step in the direction of
peace and order in China.
Department of State. Â¦Washington. October 3, 1300.
LATEST ATTITUDE OF GERMANY AND AMERICA.
Speclal Dispatch to The CalL
CAUL. BUREAU. WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â That the concert of powers with
respect to China has been restored is shown by the correspondence be
tween the United States and Germany, made public to-day. In the
memorandum handed to Secretary Hay by Baron von Sternburg, Ger-
man Charge on Tuesday it is announced that the German
Sovernrr.ent considers the edict issued by the Chinese Emperor decreeing the
Segradation of Prince Tuan and other officials "as the first step in the direction
Â»f peace and order in China." Replying to the German interrogatories relative
*o the designation of the g"uilty and their punishment, and in what manner the
powers shall control the punishment. Secretary Hay says that "it is hoped that
Ur. Conger's reply to these interrogatories will confirm the Government of the
United States in the opinion which it now shares with the Imperial German Gov
ernment that the edict In question is an important initial step In the direction of
peace and order In China."
The authorities do not hesitate to say that the modification by Germany of
her original opposition Is an Important concession in the interest of peace. They
lay it is natural that the German people should want adequate punishment of
ihe responsible authors of the outrages committed upon their Minister and fel
low subjects, ar.d this Government is prepared to obtain the same results. The
United States, however, could not consent to the surrender of the responsible
Chinese as a condition precedent to the negotiations, and an examination of the
German communication shows that the Berlin Government has abandoned this
proposal. She still holds, however, that the Ministers at Peklnp. who alone are
able to defln'tely determine those who are responsible, shall designate the
griilty and say whether the proposed punishments are in accordance with the
gravity of the crimes committed. The United States fully agrees with Germany
that the Ministers are best qualified to perform this mission.
By acquainting Minister Wu with "Its view of the vagueness of the edict In
Â¦egard to the punishment which some of the inculpated persons are to receive,"
md by signifying to him that "it would be most regrettable If Prince Tuan
fhould escape such full measure of exemplary punishment as the facts warrant.
5r if Kang VI and Chao Spu Chiao fhould receive other than their just deserts."
Â±is Government has already shown that it does not believe that the proposed
punishments are in accordance with the gravity of the crimes committed. The
Washington officials have said from the beginning of the negotiations that the
nere withdrawal of a decoration from one of the guilty Chinamen would not be
tufficicnt; that this Government would insist upon adequate punishment. There
s no doubt that the reply of the United States on this as well as on other points
nill be entirely sniisfactcry to the German Government.
It is understood here that Minister Conger will confer with his colleagues in
'eking relative to the several points embraced in the German communication, and
t is expected that an identical list will be prepared setting forth the names of
:hose Chinese who were responsible for the outrages, the character of the pun
shrrient that should be Inflicted upon them and finally in what manner the powers
ihould control the carrying out of the punishment. It is expected that the
towers will settle this last named point by appointing witnesses to attend the
ucecution of punishment. Before punishment is awarded, however, the accused
vill be given an opportunity to defend themselves, and no doubt is expressed that
:l:is will be done trith the assent of all the powers.

CHICAGO, Oct. 4.â Senator Hanna
narrowly escaped serious injury
and possible death at the hands
of some hoodlum to-night. The
Senator was billed to address a
political meeting in a big tent at the
corner of Sixty-fifth and Halstead streets,
arid a crowd of 12,000 persons gathered to
hear him. He was late In reaching the
scene, and on taking his place on the
platform was given a vociferous greeting,
lasting several minutes. He was bowing
his acknowledgments and trying to quiet
his enthusiastic admirers, when a block
of ice weighing seven or eight pounds
crashed through the roof of the tent and,
grazing the Senator's shoulder, tore its
way through the floor of the stage. Luck
ily,. Hanna , at. the moment partly turned
his body to acknowledge a cheer, or the
missile- would have struck him squarely
on the r head, with serious, if not fatal,
results.
The block of Ice evidently had been
thrown from a housetop in the vicinity",
as it had acquired a velocity that could
not have been given It by any mere mus
cular effort on the part of the most power
ful man. The Incident caused great ex
citement in the. tent, but Senator Hanna,
who, was the coolest man in the place,
turned -It' off with a Jocular reference to
It as a new form of demonstration on the
part of the Democratic Ice trust.
The police on duty about the tent were
Immediately put In motion, but, owing to
the excitement and density of the crowd,
could get no clew to the perpetrators of
the deed. _

WASHINGTON. Oct. 4.â In ac
cordance with Instructions re
ceived from the War Depa/t
ment General MacArthur, com-
manding the troops in the Phil
ippines, has made arrangements for the
prompt transportation from Taku to Ma
nila of the United States forces at Tien
tsin and Peking, not Included in the "le
gation guard" to be. maintained at Pekins
under the personal command of General
Chaffee. Nearly 4000 troops are to be
withdrawn immediately from Chinese ter
ritory and transferred to the Philippines.
Four large transports have been > as
signed to the work of transporting the
troops from Taku to Manila. These are
the Warren, with a capacity of 1200; the
Sumner, with a capacity of 770; the In
diana, with a capacity of 900. and the
Garonne, with a capacity of 950.
Word was received at the War Depart
ment to-day that the Indiana has sailed
from Manila to Taku. The other three
transports are either at the Chinese port
or in the Immediate vicinity. There are
also two or three large freight boats
available for the transportation of the
heavy arms and artillery and the horses
and equipment of the cavalry and In
fantry.
The following cablegram has been re
ceived at the War Department:
"MANILA. Oct. 4.-AdJutant General,
Washington: First Infantry to Marln

GALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct.' 4.-
A high official of the State Depart-
ment said to-night that Turkey had
not settled any portion of the missionary
claims, but her promises to pay continue
to be made.
Though Mr. Hay, Secretary of State,
invited the Turkish Government to re
move its Minister from Washington, the
Sublime Porte has answered the invita
tion by designating the successor to All
Ferrouh Bey, now in Washington. The
suggestion to the Porte that there was no
further necessity for the presence of a
Minister Plenipotentiary .. was made
through Mr. Griscom, American Charge
d' Affaires in Constantinople. Turkey was
Informed that in ,vlew of its failure to
settle the claims for the missionary out
rages, liability of which was admitted,
there were no diplomatic questions to be
discussed by the two governments, and
that consequently there was no need of
its retention of a Minister In this country.
To Mr. Griscom's note the Turkish Gov
ernment responded that It was desirous
of retaining the friendship of the United
States and would satisfy the claims with
in a short time. It further announced
that it would withdraw AH Ferrouh Bey
and would designate as his successor
Shekib Bey, -who is now in Constantino
ple. All Ferrouh Bey has not yet- pre
sented his letters of iecall, but he has
doubtless been apprised of the decision of
his Government. No Information has
been received by the department as to the
date of arrival of Shekib, as his move
ments are of comparatively little Impor
tance in view of the determination of tho
administration to conduct its negotiations
through its Charge d' Affaires in Constan
tinople.
It is not understood that this Govern
ment suggested the withdrawal of the en
tire.Turkish legation, but that the Sublime
Porte follow the course adopted by th'a
Government arid leave its interests In
charge of the secretary of t..e legation,
who will rank as Charge d' Affaires.
It. Is believed In diplomatic, circles here
that had the Chinese trouble not oc
curred this Government would have pro
ceeded to the extent of making a naval
demonstration in the Mediterranean to
compel payment of the indemnity.
Turkey, however, took advantage oT
the preoccupation of the United States in
the Far East, and although she went so
far as to fix the date when ' she â¢ would
pay the indemnity ' the $90,000 demanded
has never ..'been paid. ,

Sprcial Dispatch to The CalL
INDIANAPOL.13. jiid., Oct. 4.â The convention of Democratic Clubs fa!rly rer
eled In a feas; of Democratic oratory to-day and to-night. The Democrats
who attended to-day's meetings had the privilege of listening to the voices
of their most beloved leaders â William J. Bryan, Adlai E. Stovenscn nntl
Bourke Cockran. But two things marred the occasion for the Democrats. One
was the absence of W. R, Hearst, the president of the association, and the other
the fact that the actual representation of Democratic clubs frp-n outside the
State was not what had been expected by the more enthusiastic of the local man
agers.
The convention closed to-night with a speech by Bourk* Cockran. who Jour
neyed to the city in his private car. Adlai E. Stevenson, the Vice Presidential
candidate, was In the convention all tlay, and "William Jennings Bryan came in the
afternoon, reachlnc the city about 2:40. Mr. Bryan came in a private car. which
brought' him from Wisconsin. After arriving In the city It was necessary that he
should have a few minutes' rest, which he took while eating luncheon. It was 4
o'clock when he finally reached the convention hall and was welcomed by the
crowd that had been growirg very restless waiting fcr him. The afternoon audi
ences which attended the closing session of the convention to-night were the
largest of the two days. The hall was really crowded this afternoon. Possibly
half the crowd was composed of women.
Among the things wbich transpired to-day were reports from the different
committees, Including a set of resolutions. During the day there were speeches
galore, among them being remarks by Augustus Thomas, the playwright, of New
York, and speeches by three women. There was also a speech by a negro, Mil
ton Turner.
The absence of W. R. Hearst remained unexplained further than that it was
said he was ill. Some had hoped and even expected that Mr. Hearst would come
with the Presidential candidate, but he did not come, and* Mr. Bryan. It was
said, knew nothing of his whereabouts.
The reception accorded Bryan on the way to the hall was nothing unusual.
The crowd in the hall cheered him for ten minutes. The speakers of the after
noon were P. E. Howe of New York, Adlal E. Stevenson, former Ger.eral Master
"Workman Sovereign, Milton Turner and W. J. Bryan.
To-night Bourke Cockran was the only speaker of the convention's closing
meeting and was greeted by a large audience. He was in poor voice because of
a sore throat, but was given a respectful hearing. Bryan begins his Indiana
tour to-morrow, and Cockran will al3o make some speeches In the State.
BRYAN AND STEVENSON A MOKG THE SPEAKERS.
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 4.â Governor McMillin of Tennessee presided at the
morning session of the National Association of Democratic Clubs. The con
vention took up the report of the committee on permanent organization as soon
as the session began. The report recommended that the following officers be
elected: "W. R. Hearst, president; Max F. Ihmsen, secretary; Marcus Daly,
treasurer.
It was also recommended that the executive committee, which now consists
of seventeen members, be Increased to forty-five members, a member from
each State. After an animated discussion It was unanimously decided cot to
increase the membership of the executive committee.
Governor McMlllin of Tennessee, in taking the chair, made an address in
which he spoke of imperialism and predicted Bryan's election.
Hon. George B. McClellan of New York followed with an address denounc
ing Imperialism.
Brief addresses were also made by Mrs. Eva McDonald Valllsha of "Wash
ington, D. C; Mrs. Maria E. Walker of Chicago, president of the National "Wo
men's Bryan League; Hon. M. L. Lockwood of Pennsylvania, president of the
National Anti-Trust, League.
Adlal E. Stevenson spoke at the afternoon session, saying in part:
It augurs well that In this baitle for the preservation of free government so many
of the young Democrats of the country are actively and earnestly at work. The independ
ence of the pending struggle for political supremacy cannot be measured by words. The
supreme issue Is that of "republic or empire." Important and far-reaching as the trust
evil Is. It Is secondary to the yet greater evil of lmrwrtallsm. No unmeaning words are
used when it la declared the "paramount issue" of the campaign. Imperialism was the
issue of the pending contest before even the assembling of political conventions. It is
in the thoughts . of men and to remain until settled by the ballot.
The Republican administration Is engaged In the prosecution of war. and this without
the constitutional requirement of a formal declaration of war by Congress. It Is In the
strictest sense an administration war. The re-election of President McKlnley will be held
by himself and his partyâ and Justly soâ as an Indorsement of the policy of the administra
tion toward the Philippine Islands. Let no Republican with an uneasy conscience delude
himself with the hope that If sustained at the polls there will be a change in the methods
and policy of the administration. Such delusion is worse than midsummer madness. Ttu
condemnation of the administration by the ballot Is our only hope of escape from the peril
ous policy it has Inaugurated.
Imperialists claim they can give the Filipinos a- better government than they can pos
sibly establish for themselves. This plan of governing other people for their own good
did not originate with the Imperialists of to-day. It was the plan urged by the crafty,
heartless Talleyrand, for the government of the American colonies. Imperialism knows
nothing of limitations of power. It enthrones force as the controlling agency of govern
ment. It means the empire. Following closa in the wake of imperialism will come the
immense standing army. The dread hand of militarism will be felt In the new world as
In the oM. The strong arm of power will be substituted for the peaceful agencies which
have for more than a century made our people contented and happy. In the great struggle
now on us. we invoke the co-operation of all who revere the memory of our fathers and
to whom this declaration Is no unmeaning parchment, but the enduring chart of our lib
erties; we appeal to the sober Judgment and patriotism of the American people.
After Mr. Stevenson had concluded James R. Sovereign, ex-general master
workman of the Knights of Labor, spoke, dealing with the workingman from
a political standpoint. Mr. Sovereign was followed by J. Milton Turner, Minister
to Liberia under Grant's administration, who spoke briefly on behalf of the
negro.
DEGREE OF ENTHUSIASM IS WORKED UP.
As soon as Mr. Bryan appeared on the platform there was a wild shout
of greeting and this soon developed Into a demonstration which continued for
about six minutes, until, indeed, there was a cail for a cessation from Mr. Bryan
himself. His speech was liberally applauded throughout and wiien it was con
cluded there was a rush to the stage on the part of those in the audience who.
wished to shake hands with him. He, however, avoided this demonstration and
soon found his way back to his hotel. Mr. Bryan said in part:
As Mr. Turner .'concluded Mr. Bryan ' appeared on the platform. His ar
rival served to instill into the meeting a degree of enthusiasm which had not
previously marked, the proceedings of the convention. He reached the city a
few minutes before 3 o'clock, but did not arrive at the hall until 4:15 o'clock.
He was escorted through the streets by a number of marching clubs and was
welcomed at every turn by throngs of people.*./'. â¢'
I appreciate the work done and being done and to be done by this association of
Democratic clubs, and appreciate the energy, tfce enthusiasm and the ability displayed by
Mr. Hearst, the president of this association. I believe In these clubs. We need them.
We need clubs far more than the Republicans need clubs. In fact, my friends, the work
of Democracy, being the work of the people, must be done by the people. Machinery la
not sufficient when we have but machinery alone to win a Democratic fight. WÂ» need these
clubs to aid in the work and supplement the effort3 of our national. State and local or
ganizations. We need the clubs to help us to carry on our campaign. The Republican
party can get its money from the corporations, which plunder the people between cam
paigns In return for the money contributed during campaigns. We cannot go to a trust
and ask It to help us. because we do not expect to be helped. We know that every
speech made by a Democrat against these trusts makes It easier for their party to raise a
campaign fund. Tou understand it. We need these clubs to help us collect money to
carry on the campaign.
The Republican party does not collect ironey for its national campaign fund from one
Republican, out of a hundred, and when election is over M out of every 100 Republican*
have nothing to say about the. running of the Government. We expect that the cam
palzn will be conducted In behalf of the great mass of Americans, and we have the right
to call on them to help with their money as well as their votes to win this fight, which
Is their fight and not our flsht. We need clubs to help get the votes out on election day.
Out in our State we sometimes arrange to have volunUers who will go out. and when they
find a man who thinks he is too busy husking corn to spare the time to vote, the vol
unteer husks in his place until he sroes and votes. We need these clubs to help get the
vote out. and then we need these clubs to help get the rotes counted and to prevent fraud
after they are cast. I glory in the work done thus far.. The meeting of these delegates
here is an indication of the interest taken In this work, and I beg you to spend every
possible moment between now and election In securing funds for those principles which,
you believe in and for this cause which I have so earnestly espoused.
Mr. Bryan then went Into a discussion of the campaign issues, paying es-
pedal attention to the trust question. He continued:
The Republican party is not prepared to defend Itself on the army question. They say

Mr. Hammett said that at present the
cutters should not .work more than seven
months a year, owing to the fact that the
glass production was in excess of the do
mestic demand. The workers have a wage
scale committee, which meets with the
manufacturers each year and adjusts the
wage scale and other matters'for the en

run from $5 to $6 a day. The men are not
at work now. owing to some differences
over the season's schedule, which is still

The other day at Lincoln I stated that Gov

spoken of the regular tTnited States soldiers
as $15 a month hirelings." He has denied that
he has ever made such a statement, attribut
ing to me the word butcher, which I never
used. He was reported in the press as having
madÂ« euch a statement, but Mr. Dietrich and
Mr. Steufer. now, running on the Republican
State ticket, heard him make use of those
words In the latter part of August at an old

thlc Is no question of militarism, arid yet a n army four times as great as the standing
army of 1S96 Is demanded by the President's message of December, 1S98. How much do â¢
we EDend for education in the United States? Less than /JIJOO.OOO.OOO a year. How much 1
do the Republicans want to spend on military establishments? One hundred million dol
lars a year. They want to spend more than half as much for a military establishment as
we srend for the education of all the children in the United States. Is that not a Btep
toward militarism? There are two reasons which lead men in this country to want a large
Etanding army. One is a domestic one; the other Is called our foreign affairs. What do
mestic reason Is there for a large army? To protect us from the Indians? So; the less
Indians we have the more army the Republicans want. That Is not the cause. Why do
they want It? So that they can build a fort near every large city and use the army to
suppress by force the discontent that ought to be cured by remedial legislation. !
The laboring man asks for arbitration and gets a large army; he asks relief from
government by Injunction and gets a large army; he asks protection* from the blacklist
and his answer is a large army; he asks for shorter hours of labor in order that he may
have more time with his family .and for the development of his mind and his answer is
a large army; he asks for representation In th<Â» President's Cabinet In order that labor
may be protected and his answer is a' large army. That is i the domestic reason which is
not given. What is the reason they give? They say th'ey need It for our foreign policy,
but, my Mends, they asked for the army before the American people had ever decided upon
a foreign policy that made a large army necessary. In December of 1S98, when' the Presi
dent asked for his army, the treaty had not yet been signed..- but Its terms were under
stood. When the Republican Congress voted to raise the army to 100,000 the treaty had
been signed and no arm was raised against this nation anywhere in the world. But the
American people had never voted for a colonial policy. Up to this time tha American
people have never voted for a colonial policy, and yet the Republican party is pledged to a
farce army.
CONCLUDING SESSION OF THE CONVENTION.
The concluding session of the convention, at which W. Bourke Cockran was
the speaker of the evening, witnessed a densely packed hall and great enthu
siasm. Governor McMillin of Tennessee called the meeting to order at 8 o'clock
and Introduced Mr. Cockran, who was received with great applause. Mr. Cock
ran devoted his speech to the question of imperialism. He said In part:
Nobody can dispute the fact that Congress can seize any territory that It chooses.
That power nobody disputes. If the taktng of the Philippine Islands be profitable, and if
the mere fact that it be profitable makes it Justifiable, then where on top of this earth is
there a piepe of territory that we. ought rot to seize?
There are a million reasons for takinp Canada. I don't think there Is onÂ© for hesitat
ing to annex It providing It could be accomplished peaceably. The annexation of Canada
Is the dream of every patriot, I think ail event of the future almost as certain aa anything
that can be forecasted. The annexation of Mexico is not an improbability. The annexation
of China would be a. lew fanciful suggestion now than the annexation of the Philippines
would have been three years ago. Nay, more. There in much more abundant justification
for the taking of China than for the taking of the Philippines. China has at least in
sulted our dignity In the person of our Embassadctr. If wt Invaded' China, and If we
conquered it. we would be punishing enemies. In attempting to Bubdue the Philippines we
are butchering our allies. If ConKreÂ«s has the right to erect in any territory newly acquired
whatever f<?rm of government it pleases we may have the President of the United States
exercising more multifarious duties than Poobah. He may be a constitutional monarch in
Canada, a captain general In Mexico, a pro-ccnsul In South America, eon of heaven In
China; I know not what elsewhere. â¢ . *ii>
If Conuress can establish extraconftitutional power In the Philippine: Islands and gov
ern as it pleases it can establish fifty different forms of powers in Juet as many different
places as it can seize by the use of brute force and mijjht.
At 10:10 o'clock the convention adjourned sine die.

I/3XDON, Oct. 5 (4 a. m.)â "The Khaki"
boon has 6wept the country. Yesterday's
liolllngs are a ta'.e of increased Minister
ialist uDd diminished Liberal majorities.
The returns from the rural districts to- '
Oay (Friday) and to-morrow may do
t-omething to rehabilitate the Liberals,
tat the results thus far have fully Justi
fied Mr. Chamberlain and the party or
tanizefs who Are backing the government,
in their election of the moment to dis
solve Parliament.
Few doubt that an appeal to the country
:i month or two earlier would have pro
duced an even greater Unionist outburst.
Nevertheless, the Ministerialists may al
ready congratulate themselves on being
-oturnod with .in increased majority. Yes
?erday the Conservatives gained twelve
itauj as against three gained by the
Liberals.
The workingmen of the country have
replied in very decided voice in favor of
the wax and cf the annexation of the
republics. Even Liberal Scotland is at
last feeling the full force of the shock,
the Glasgow Tories being as much
as the Liberals at their unex
pected success in winning two seats. An
drew Dryburgh Provand, who was de
feated In the Blackfrlars division, has
hat for Glasgow in the Liberal Interest
.<ince 38M. and the Bridgetown division
was Sir George Otto Trevelyan's old eeat.
Both had long been Liberal strongholds.
The results in Liverpool and other in
dustrial districts tell a similar story of
increased Unionist majorities.
Mr. Chamberlain, who was listening to
the results over the telephone, sent the
following message to the people of Birm
ingham:
"This has been a good day's work of
the empire."
London itself felt the full tide of the
Vnionist victory. The Liberal representa
tion from the metropolis will not amount
to more than seven or eight out of sixty
two members. Indeed, the isolated Lib
eral successes only serve to enhance the
Fweephm nature of the Unionist triumph.
In all directions the anti-war candidates
have Ix^en defeated. Even Mr. Cremer's
success at Hajrgerston Is doubtful, as a
recount has he^n demanded.
Londoners were not slow last evening
to testify their delight. Wherever the
results were oisplayed crowds collected
to cheer and to demonstrate in favor of
their favorites. In various polling dis
tricts the candidates appeared at win
dows or drove about, receiving tremend
ous ovations. The returns from many
1'oints will not be known until toward
noon to-iiay.
At midnight returns showed the total
number to be t'ected to be SS7, with the
relative strength of parties as follows:
Mini5ter:a!ists 2Sft; Liberals, including
Lfihorites. 72; Nationalists 45.
The Conservatives have gained alto
pether twenty-one seats, and the Liberals
fourteen.
The Daily Mail describes the election as
"the rout of the pro-Boers" and "the
debacle of 'Little Englandism.' "
Only one of the seven boroughs of Bir
mingham was contested, but the Liberals
organized an aggressive campaign to take
one seat in Mr. Chamberlain's city. He,
took an active part in the canvass in be
fcalf of Sir J. Benjamin' Stone^Oonserya
llve candidate for ICast Birmingham, and
the victory of the latter is considered in
part a personal triumph for the Secretary
of State' for the Colonies. â¢ ! - -â¢ ..
In the Scotland division of Liverpool T.

constituency since 1*55. wds re-elected.
Mr. O'Connor's majority is 78 less than it
was iiÂ» the general election of 1S35, when
he defeated W. E. McCartney, Conserva
tive, by 643 votes. In the other Liver
pool boroughs the Conservatives gained
larpely.
In thÂ«Â» Central division of Leeds Gerald

SHAMOKIN. Pa,. Oct. 4.â Three thou
sand strikers, headed by a band and 300
slate-picker boys, the latter carrying small
American flags, left Mount Carmel this
morning to march to Treverton, sixteen
miles distant, in Northumberland County,
to urge the workmen of the North Frank
lin colliery to remain at home to-morrow.
The North Franklin operators have not
ceased work since the strike started, and
strikers from all over the region were an
gered over the failure of the Treverton
men to tie-up the colliery; hence as the
Mount Carmel marchers swung along the
highway they declared they would not be
balked in their effort to take the matter
up themselves. In the meantime the
Reading Coal and Iron CJompany had
rushed a special train consisting of five
carloads of deputies from Schuylkill
County to the scene. General Gobln at
. Shenandoah had also been asked to hold
himself in readiness to dispatch troops to
Treverton if a fight occurred, and if the
Sheriff should call for militia,
President Fahey. of the . ninth' mining
district, telephoned from - Pottsville to
Gcorgo Hartiine- secretary of the district,
to stop the march. Hartiine, accompanied
by several members of the executive
board, hurried up the road, and at Green
.Ridge, three miles out from Mount Car
mel, came upon the marchers. The com
mittee mounted a platform and Hartiine,
in a five-minute address to the highly ex
cited men. persuaded them to go home.
Then he hurried to this place, where 5000
miners were gathered on Shamokin and
Commerce streets, awaiting the arrival of
the marchers. From a hotel balcony Hart
line, told of his successful mission, and
pleaded with his auditors to disperse,
which they did.
Some time later officials of the North
Franklin colliery announced that to pre
vent trouble the colliery would not be
operated until the strike was settled.
HAZELTON, Oct. 4.â General Gobin, as
a result of the march to Treverton, to
night rescinded his order /for Battery C
of the National Guard to return home
Affairs were quiet In all other sections
of the anthracite field to-day, and the
strikers scored Important gains in the
closing Gf additional collieries in the
Schuylkill district.
With a cessation qf operations at the
North Franklin, all of the Philadelphia
and Reading Company's twenty-nine col
liories will have now ceased work. The
point of attack by the United Mine Work
ers' organizers now is the Panther Creek
Valley in the lower Lehigh region, where
the collieries of the Lehigh Coal and Nav
igation Company have been practically
in full operation since the strike began
in the other sections. Strenuous efforts
have been put forth to induce the men to
quit work and join the union.
President Mitchell to-day said there was
no immediate prospect of a convention of
miners to consider the concessions offered
by the operators.
None of the Lackawanna Company's
strikers availed themselves of the offer
of increased wages if they should return
to work to-day. Â»
? i Â¦ i
NO NOTICE TAKEN OF OFFER.
Miners Refuse to Return to Work and
Arrange a Big Demonstration.-
HAZLETOX, Oct. 4.-Not the slightest
notice has been taken by the striking
minors of the 10 per cent offered to the
employes by several of the larger coal
companies. As far as is definitely known
not one striking miner has accepted the
advance, but on the other hand more have
quit their places, notably in the Schuyl
kill region, where three additional col
lieries of the Reading Company were
shut down. The United Mine Workers'
officials are still hard at work trying to
close the few mines that continue in
operation. All the organizers and tlu
national committeemen were in some part
of the field during the day, only President
Mitchell being on duty at headquarters.
Mr. Mitchell did little else than to attend
to his correspondence and answer tele
phone calls from different sections of the
region. When he was asked , what was
new In the strike situation, he briefly re
plied:
"We are waiting on the operators."
He says he had no information to-day
as to the movements of the mine owners
other than that printed in the newspapers.
He also remarked that the call for . an
anthracite miners' convention is not yet
in sight. When the convention is called,
however, Scranton win probably be
chosen for It, because of its availabil
ity for convention puposes. But it is too
early 'yet to say that a convention will
be held there next Wednesday.
Applications by striking miners for re
lief are beginning to be received by local
unions In several sections of the anthra
cite field. President Mitchell said to
night that wherever 'applications have
been made for relief necessary supplies
were furnished. A report waa received
from Wilkesbarre to-day that a commit
tee, representing twenty-three local
unions, embracing- about 14,000 miners,
would confer with the national president
over the telephone about relief, but up to
midnight this had not been done.
About eighty men marched from Free
land to Pond Creek to-day for the,purposÂ«
of inducing forty men employed by the
Pond Creek and Wilkesbarre Coal Com
pany to join the striking miners. The
marchers reached there at noon, just as
the men were leaving the mines. The
strikers were met by ex-Judge Latrobe,
president of the company,' and Superin
tendent " Thomas McFarland, who ex
plained to the bti'kers that the company
was only developing the mine and would
send no coal to market if the strikers
would not ask the men to quit work. The
marchers agreed to this proposition, ami
Mr. I.atrobe took the Freedland men to
the village grocery store and treated them
10 crackers and apples. The United Mine
Workers are making extra efforts to got
the men who are still working in the
Panther Creek Valley to strike and join
the union. More organizers have been
sent into the valley with the hope of
swinging the 1500 men still working there
Into line.
President Mitchell to-night said that the
strikers of the Lackawanna Valley will
make an effort to outdo the Wilkesbarre
demonstration at Scranton next Wednes
day. It Is the intention to have a big pa
rade of miners from the entire Lacka
wanna .Valley. A mass meeting will fol
low, at which President Mitchell and other
mine workers' officials. will speak. . . .

FIRST STEP IN RESTORING PEACE.
PROPOSITIONS OF A FAR-REACHING NATURE.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â Propositions of a far-reaching character concerning
China are being presented in rapid succession to this Government. The State
Department had no sooner disposed of one of these propositions to-day by de
livering a response to the German Government than it was confronted by an
even more Important proposition submitted by the Ffench Government, and
within half an hour formally seconded by the Russian' Government.
The Franco-Russian proposal takes a much broader scope and submits a pro
gramme under which the negotiations for a complete settlement can be carried
forward. The French Charge. M. Thiebaut, handed the proposition to Secretary
Hay shortly after noon and held a brief conference concerning It. Half an hour
later M. de Wallant, the Russian Charge, arrived at the State Department and
handed to Mr. Hay a cable expressing Russian approval of the propositions
Just submitted by France. Mr Hay gave no formal answer to the two com
munications, as they will go first to the President at Canton.
The Franco-Russian proposition is under four headsâ namely, first, punish
ment of the guilty persons; second, interdiction of the shipment of arms Into
China: third, payment of indemnity to the powers, and fourth, sufficient guar
antees for the future.
In addition a suggestion Is made for the establishment of a permanent lega
tion guard at Peking, for the razing of the Taku forts and for the maintenance
of a line of communication between Peking and the sea.

came up shortly befqre noon to-day grew
quite heavy by the middle of the after
noon, though the clouds cleared away be
fore dark. The effect on prunes and
grapes depends largely upon the weather
conditions that follow in the next few
days. Some damage has probably been
done to both grapes and prunes, but it is
not believed any serious loss will be suf
fered. The precipitation to-day was .42
of an intfli. yesterday. .23. , .
SANTA CRUZ, Oct." 4.â There has been
heavy rain to-day/ accompanied by wind.
The bay has been very rough, and the
fishermen were compelled to land their
boats. At noon for nearly a half hour
there was a heavy downpour, which was
extraordinary for this season. It will do
considerable damage to the ripe grapes on
the vines.
PACIFIC GROVE, Oct. 4.â Nearly an
inch of rain fell here between noon and 5
p. m. to-day. Advices from surrounding
districts show that the rain was general
throughout this section, though not uni
formly heavy. Ranchers fear consider
able damage to ungathered crops, espe
cially prunes, almonds and beans.
SUISUN, Oct. 4.â A heavy rain fell this
morning. It has had the effect of extin
guishing fires in the hills.
D1XON. Oct. 4.â Light showers are fall
ing and there are indications of a heavy
downpour of welcome rain. The farmers
prepared for it. Some raisins are still out
drying, but there will be little if any loss,
as help is plentiful and the trays are be
ing rapidly put under shelter.
â¢ REDDING, Oct. 4.â This city was to
day tho center of a terrific downpour of
rain. All afternoon the water came down
in sheets. As yet no damage is reported.
If the storm continues outlying creeks
will be impassable, cutting off stage traf
llc in all directions. Fully two Inches of
rain foil inside of six hours.
PENNGROVE. Oct. 4.â A heavy rain
has been falling almost continually in this
locality since an early hour last evening,
and at a late hour to-night shows no sign
of abating. Shortly after 8 o'clock this
morning a small cloudburst of short dura
tion was experienced here. Only slight
damage has been done and untold good
will result. Pasturage and summer fal
low ground have been benefited greatly.
WOODLAND. Oct. 4.â Up to 8 o'clock
this morning the rainfall amounted to .31
of an inch, but there have been some heavy
showers to-day and there are strong in
dications of more. The first rain last sea
son fell on October 13. I*arge quantities !
of raisin grapes are still out, but the
trays have either been stacked or put in
drying-housÂ«*s and the damage will not
be serious If the weather soon clears up.
The prevailing opinion is that the wine
grapes will not be materially injured.

GUILTY OF MURDER
Jury at Plaeerville Convicts Him of

Which He May Be
PLACERVILLE. Oct. 4.â The Jury In
the Zumwalt murder case at 12:35 a, m.
returned a verdict against the def^idant
of murder in the first degree. .
Isaiah Zumwalt is accused of having
murdered his wife, his son George and his
grandchild at the house of his son at Dia
mond Springs on June 7. When arrested
he feigned Insanity, but experts pro
nounced him sane.
No satisfactory motive for the crime has
ever been discovered. The prisoner and
his wife had quarreled frequently and she
finally left him, took up her abode with
her son George and tiled suit for divorce.
The night the crime was committed the
elder Zumwalt went to his son's house
with a loaded rifle. Gcorse met him at
the door and Isaiah raised his rifle and
tired. The bullet struck George in the
breast and he fell dead. A second bullet
struck Mrs. Julia/ Zumwalt in the head,
killing her instantly. George's wife then
picked up their infant child and rushed
from the house. As she was passing out
of the door the murderer flred at her.
The bulW passed through the body of the
child and slightly injured its mother.
Zumwnlt then barricaded himself in the
hoi]<=Â»> and with rifle and revolver defied
the officers to take him. He was finally
prevailed upon, however, to leave the
house and submit to arrest.

Tho cost of the slave shipâ the amount
of capital requiredâ is an Important mat
tre. The story of the Baltimore schooner
Napoleon is remarkable from- this point
of view. She measured but ninety tons.
She made . a number of successful voy
agesâbut the facts ih one will suffice.
In 1833 she took on a cargo composed of
young negroes of the Kassoos, the Fl.and
Sherbro - Bullons nationsâ fierce young
lighters, everyone. Of these she landed
350. They cost $16 each, and sold for $3600
each; With all expenses . out, Including
a present of $5000 to her surgeon,
Richard Drake, whoso knowledge of the
coast about Matanzas enabled her to
dodge a British cruiser, she cleared more
than $100,000. And yet $5000 would have
been considered an enormous price for
a little schooner like that In those days.
In each voyage she paid, about $20 net
profit -on each dollar of the cost of con
struction.â Scrlbner's. ; ; .. .

"If the request for a Jury had been
mnde at anv time hefore the trial." said
the court. "I probably would have grant
ed it. but the case must go on to-day. It
would bo extrome-ly difficult to secure a
jury to sit In this case, and under all the
circumstances I deem It proper to refuse
the city's motion for a Jury trial. I am
here for the purpose of trying this case
fairly and Impartially, and I think my
record wil.1 bear me out in saying that
I have always decided all cases submitted
to me in accordance with the law and
evidence. I have been selected by Judge
Ogden to sit In this case because I am
not tainted with any prejudice that Is
claimed to prevail here In relation to this
case. I propose to try the action honestlv
and fairly."
The first witness called was J. II. T
\\ ntkinson. president of the Contra
Costa Water Company. The first ques
tion put to him was In -relation to the
property owned by the water company.
It was met with a. strong objection from
Attorney Hayne. who held lhat Watkin
son had no right to testify in regard to
the company's holdings, as the city had
attempted to examine the corporation's
property accounts and was refused the
privilege by the water, company officials.
Attorney McCutcheon claimed that
there was no showing before the court
that the city had been denied. an oppor
tunity to Inspect the books, and Attorney
Hayne offered to prove by witnesses that
the city was refused the right to see the
accounts.
After considerable argument Judge Hart
decided that tht city had a right to dis
place President Watkinson with one of
its own witnesses. .
opposing so strenuously my request for a
jury?"
This remark aroused Judge Hart, who
at once called a halt in the argument.
Apparently taking Mr. Hayne's closing
remark to himself, the court said:
"Mr. Moore has no concealed reason- so
far as I am concerned. I have no special
reasons except those of law for refusing a
Jury In this case. I am here to try this
action by the law and the evidence, and
I object to these insinuations of counsel
in relation to myself."
"I intended no Insinuations, your
Honor," replied Attorney Hayne.
"That may he," answered Judge Hart,
"but you continually appeal to my dis
cretion in the interests of justice. This
certainly conveys an inference that is un
warranted and unprovoked." .
This practically concluded the argu
ment on the motion for a jury and Judge
Hart immediately denied the city's re
quest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 4.
JUDGE E. C. HART is determined
to try the water rate suit, despite
whatever objections, legal or other
wise, may 1m? brought to bear
against him. His path from the
time he was lnvltÂ«Â«d to preside has not
been of t v Â»Â«* smoothest, but notwithstand
ing the many points raised against him
the Judge from the capital city remains
firm in his intention to sit in the case or
compel Ptrongtr. objections to be .raised
than tho?e already made against him.
Judge Hart had occasion this morning
.to show his determination to remain in
the case, come what may.
As soon as the cape wan called this
morning Judge Hayne asked that certain
special issues be submitted to a jury- He
feaid:
"There are Questions involving alleged
fraud and good faith, and they should be
submitted to a jury. 'In. making this re
quest we mean no ret'.cciion upon your
Honor, but we simply ask that questions
of fact be submitted to a jury while. the
court passes upon the law."
Attorney Iiayne's re quest was lmme
diately opposed by Attorney E. J. Mc-
Cutchwja, for the water company, who
eald he considered It rather strange that
m. jury should be* asked for at such a late
stage' of the suit. He said there was no
Jury present and a great deal of valuable
time would be lost in securing one. Mr.
STeCuteheon Â«ald:
'The verdict of a jury In a case, like
this would be simply advisory and would
be practically valueleps. A question of
fraud is simply a question of law. The
point at Issue Involves the consolidation
of the Contra Costa and Oakland water
companies, and this is but a point of
law."
Judge Hayne. in reply, argued that his
motion for a jury was proper. Mr.
Hayne nald If this was an argument
against calling a Jury it could be urged
in any equity case.
Here Mr. McOutoheon raised the further
point lhat any jurymen summoned from
the city of Oakland or Its suburbs would
be disqualified, because they were water
rate pavers.
Attorney A. A. Moore uphrld Mr. Mc-
OutÂ«-heon !n his contention that Mr.
HayrK'p reqiieFt for a jury came too late.
In closing his argument on his motion
for a . 1 ury Attorney Hayne remarked that
the attorneys for the Contra Costa Water
Ci-.mpany apparently had some secret rea
son for Opposing a jury. .^- Â¦â¢
"I might ask Mr. Moore." he said, "if
he bas not. come dark, hidden reason for
HRef-uises .^ttcxri^ey 3r3IeL^7-n.o's Motion for
examine, If possible, the books of the
water company, was then called. The
Witness stated that on August 6 at At
torney McCutcheon's office, he made a
demand upon President J. H. T. Watkln
son. Vice President \V. J. Dingee and
Secretary Walter Beattle of the water
company to see the books, for the Inspec
tion of which he had secured an order of
court.* â¢ Â¦: .
"Mr. Watkinson told . me," testified Van
Bokkelen. "that the water company had
purchased no property for a year and
that all records previous to that time had
been destroyed. He told me that if I
wanted to see what the company owned
to look at the large map then hanging on
the wall in his office. I asked to see the
accounts of the corporation, but was de
nied that privilege on the , ground that
what books they had were not books of
account.
The company's map book was produced
in court and Attorney Hayne wanted
Judge Hart to examine' it. To this At
torney McCutcheon objected unless the
book was placed in evidence. Mr. Hayne
.objected to the book as evidence but the
court admitted it. Judge .Hart will ex
amine its contents, to-morrow.
The case .was continued until to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
* Many curious and interesting complica
tions growing out of the Hoboken water
front conflagration are doming up for ad
justment. For example, a bargeload of
prain was purchased by a Produce Ex

by one of the steamers of the North Ger

was started for Hobokt-n In tow of a tus.
There the record ends. Up to the present
time no trace of barge, grain or tug, or of
any one employed on either craft, has
come to light. Vessels and cargo were
covered by the policies of insurance usual
under the circumstances, but the proof of
loss needed to establish a claim against
the underwriters is not forthcoming. It
is not known that either narge or tug ever
reached Hoboken. though it is assumed
that they ' made the run safely and tied
up to one of the burned wnarves, but the
total absence of proof Is extremely em
barrassing. The last of the authenticated
record ends with the starting of the bargo
for Hoboken. The fact that it cannjt be
traced, even to the steamer wharf. owln<

OAKLAND. Oct. 4.â "Rev. Dwight
E. Potter of the Union-street
Presbyterian Church has started
one of the most unique and yet
most practical inquiries into the
church conditions of the present day that
has been advanced from the pulpit- Rev.
Mr. Potter has prepared a circular letter
which he Is addressing to thoso from
whom ; he thinks he can secure original
answers. This letter is accompanied by
a card containing seven questions, which
the one addressed is requested to answer.
It Is the remarkable character of these
questions that has attracted attention to
the plan of Mr. Potter. The questions
strike directly at the very foundation of
the relations between the church and the
workingman, the relations between pas
tors and the people, and why men do not
attend church. These questions and the
answers will be discussed at every Sun
day evening service of the Union-street
Presbyterian Church during October.
This Is the letter sent out by Mr. Potter:
OAKLAND. Cal.. Sept. 14. 1900.
My Dear Sir: Reprettlnp that so many work
lnginen stand aloof from the church, and de
siring to get an unprejudiced view of the rea
pon>Â«, and feeling that the m?n ran Rive me
information far more valuable than theories. I
am sending the inclosed questions to a large
number with requests for written answers.
Please permit me to ask this favor of you and
that you will say frankly and fully all you
think. I need and Invite your help In this,
that the church may be made better and more
useful. AH KUfreestions and all honest, sincere
criticism will be most welcome. Speak your
real convictions. Names will not be used, but
extracts from answers will be read and the
questions fully discussed at the Union-street
church. 7:30 o'clock, every Sunday evening dur
ing October. Hence an early reply will prreatly
oblige. We would be clad to have you and
your friends hear the answers read and the
questions discussed. Very respectfully,

WORKINGMEN ASKED WHY
THEY AVOID THE CHURCH
A resident of Des Moines, Iowa, was a
witness to a Spanish bullfight at Seville,
Spain, a few years ago, at which one of
the animals In the amphitheater was a
Texas steer, says the Chicago Chronicle.
A steer, he says, will never attack â¢
horse or man on horseback. A man on
foot he may kill, but a man on horseback
he will not molest. He also does not shut
his eyes when he charges, while a, bull
takes his line and then shuts h.s eyes
and charges, never deviating from >..ie
line his sight gave nim before he closed
his orbs. This it Is that enables the tore
ador to step so easily out of the way, for
the bull, not seeing, makes no attempt to
reach the man when he has moved from
the spot he occupied when the bull
charged.
"The only trial of the Texas steer, '
continued the Iowan. "was pulled off at
Seville, and while they Intended potting
seven, thÂ«v first one they let loose gave
them all they wanted and quickly brought
tKat experiment to an inglorious finish.
After the steer had cavorted about tne
ring for a while they- turned a horse
loose. The steer paid no attention to
him. but the horse, fearful of the un
known beast, would not advance. In came
a helper with a sharp stick and the steer,
positively bellowing for Joy. started. *s
the crowd supposed, for the horse. By
him the steer went in pursuit of the big
ger game and the helper shortly cleared
the protective fence with ten feet to spare
owing to the steer's able assistance. The
representative of the Texas cattle- trade
went over that six-foot barric- as though
It was a prairie dog mound of his native
plains, but the helper won out to one of
the nrotective boxes and safety. ,
"The steer did his bfst to get ftt him.
but finding it Imnosslble looked about for
other game with which to sport. Tho
stone seats are ten feet above the ground
and this has always been an insurmount
able barrier for a bull, hut they reckoned
without their Texas steer when they built
them for as soon as the steer's eyes lit
on the throng above his head he stepped
back and the next instant he was among
them. Before the people could escape he
had tossed half a dozen Into the ring, but
they were all rescued V the ring attend
ant's. The stone peats cleared the steer re
turned to the ring and. peeing no* one
else to throw the gage of battle to. took
the exact center of the ring and bellowed
his defiance to the universe. In the mean
time the management had been busy and
a soldier with a Mauser rifle had beer
summoned from a nearby barrack. With
the boxrail as a rest he took steady aim
and with the ping of the bullet the Steer's
life ended, but the Spaniards have not
experimented with American steers In
Snar.lsh rings since that time, nor are
they likely to again. Like other things
American the Texas steer Is not now pop
ular in Spain." .

COURT. AND SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE '
THAT HAVE LED TO THE FINAL RUPTURE. |
I
THE marital woes of Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard Dcettger, the former a
proprietor of the Seattle restau
rant at 677 Mission street, will
soon be aired In court. The hus
band yesterday brought suit for a di
vorce on the grounds of cruelty, intemper
ance and Infidelity. He makes a number
of serious allegations, charging his wife
with having attempted to murder him on
August 1 by feloniously turning on gas in
his room while he was asleep. She Is
said to have broken the dishes In his place
of business and thrown the meats out to
the dogs in the street; also to have cut
his clothing, hats and neckties into
shreds; also to have demolished the fur
niture and fixtures In his room and dis
turbed his peace generally.
The couple was married In 1S90. Seven
years ago, Doettger says, Mrs. Doettger
commenced to drink, and since then his
life has been a misery. She attempted
suicide several times, and once on an Oak
land ferry-boat had to be kept In con
finement.
Mrs. Doettser denies that she tried to
murder her husband. She says she turned
on the gas In an attempt to end her own
existence. The other charges she admits
are true. Her trouble began, she says,
when her husband became jealous of her.
She beps for a chance to become recon
ciled to him and promises that if he will
give her another opportunity she will be
a good woman. The husband says he has
given her enough chances. He will pack
her trunk to-day and put it in the hall.
Meanwhile he will pay her room rent at
the Fareo House.

the tendency now is to regard Sunday aa
the most unfortunate day. According to
a moderate statistician, who has just pub

ject. Sunday is certainly morÂ« unlucky
than Friday, so far as rulers and other
prominent personages are concerned. The
King of Italy, he points out. was killed on
Sunday, and It was on Sunday that two
previous attempts against his life were
made, namely, on Sunday, March 17. 1ST8.
and on Sunday. March 23, 1S33. Other
cases cited by him are those of the Due

against 'freak' advertising to take in it
signs and bill boards. Though the other

Upon cross-examining Detective Dillon
the defendant's attorney attempted to in
troduce the fact that Layden before he
died stated that he did not wish Harris
to be prosecuted, as he was to blame, but
an objection was made by Deuprey and
sustained by the Judge.
The case will be heard again to-day,
when ex-Judge Ferral will move for "a
dismissal, and if that motion is denied he
will place the defendant on the stand and
several other witnesses, with the object
of proving that Harris acted solely in
self-defense.
The other witnesses examined were
Corporal George. W. Russell, Dr. T. F. ]>-
land, who made the autopsy on Layden's
body; George W. Warren. Edgar WUbert.
"William Davock. Howard Healey, Joseph
Goldstein and Detective Dillon.
. All the witnesses for, the prosecution
were examined yesterday, but nothing
new was developed. Joseph P. Corcoran,
manager of the office, was perhaps the
most important witness for the prosecu
tion. He testified to Hayden and Harris
having had a quarrel weeks before the
stabbing. After the stabbing Harris said
to him: "I stuck the knife into him as
far as it would go. If I had only had a
gun with me I would have killed "him."
Layden was a bigger and older boy than
Harris, and the two had trouble before
the nifirht of the fatal stabbing. That
night Layden had assaulted Harris two
or three times, tiil finally Harris stabbed
Layden, resulting in his death. A pecu
liarly sad incident in connection with the
tragedy was the suicide of Dr. Harris, the
defendant's father, at Salinas, through
grief at his son's disgrace.

of being the first Superior Court Judge to
try a case in the Hall of Justice. It Is

LIE PASSES IN JUDGE HEBBARD'S COURT.
SELF-DEFENSE IS WAYNE HARRIS' PLEA
An assertion made by Attorney T. Z.
Blakeman In Judge Hebbard's court yes
terday morning was branded as "abso
lutely false and a lie" by Lucius L. Solo
mons, and for a time trouble was Immi
nent. Mrs. Theresa Bell was on the stand
under examination by Attorney W. T.
Tauszky in her action to secure the re
conveyance to her of property at 731 Sut
ter street, which she alleges "Mammy"
Pleasant fraudulently conveyed to Lucius
L. Solomons. "Mr. Tauszky asked her If
ft was not a fact that in addition to her
maiden name, Theresa Harris, her name
by her first marriage. Mrs. John Percy,
and her present name, Theresa Bell, sh^
had at one time used the name Theresa
Clingan. Mrs. Bell admitted that she
purchased the Sutter-street property un
der the name of Clln?an In 1S59.
Tauszky then presented three deeds to
the property, all bearing the same dat?.
One from Theresa Clingan conveyed thÂ«Â»
property to Mary E. I'leasant. A second
reconveyed the property to Theresa Bell.
The third was from Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Bell to Mary E. Pleasant.
Blakeman got up and said counsel'*
action was taken with the evident pur
pose of misleading the court, for, he said,
the defendant had admitted that two ot
the deeds were the same.
"Presuming." said Solomons, "that I
am the defendant referred to, I will say
that Mr. Blakeman's statement is a He."
"Notwithstanding the ungentlemanly
assertion of Mr. Solomons," answered
Blakeman. "I will repeat my statement."
Wallace A. "Wise, who is associated with
the defense, said he would take advan
tage of the opportuntiy to reiterate Mr.
Solomons' statement as to the truthful-,
ness of Blakeman's assertion.
Judge Hebbard orderea the indulgence

The marvelous augmentation of the railroad traffic
of the nation will undoubtedly have the effect of re
viving public interest in -traffic problems as soon as
the Presidential election is over and the cessation of
the Bryanite agitation gives the people a chance to
once more talk business. The Interstate Commerce
Commission, which has time and again asked for
greater powers of regulating freight rates, will un
doubtedly renew the request, and the issue will in
that way be once more made a matter of practical
politics.
When the discussion upon it becomes earnest it will
J\A ANY evidences of the extraordinary prosper
/ \ ity of the United States are before the people
at this time, but among them all there is none
more impressive' than the orders given by the gre3t
trunk lines for additional freightcars and locomotives.
Our railway system is already one of the industrial
marvels of the world, and yet it is insufficient for the
needs of our expanding industry and domestic com
merce. The number of new cars that have been or
dered to meet the demands of freight runs high up
into the thousands, and the end is not yet.
Along with the increased freight traffic there ought
to be a proportional diminution of freight rates.
There has been a decrease to some extent, but it is
by no means equal to what the public has a right to
expect. Moreover, the decrease has been frequently
made in a way that disturbs business almost as much
as it helps it, and in many cases has injured individuals
instead of benefiting them. Such results are due to
the unfair discriminations exercised by the railways
in making freight reductions! In fact, it- not infre
quently happens that while the roads can show a
large decrease in rates for the country at large,
for many localities there have been virtaally no re
ductions at all.

IS ,THATMARKHANNA,MAMMA?
I â ;ROM reports that come to us of the Indianapo-
I lis convention of Democratic clubs it appears
the affair has fallen flat and is virtually a com
plete failure. Instead of the grand gathering of stal
wart Bryanites "one hundred thousand strong," as
was expected by sanguine leaders and loudly pro
claimed through the yellow journals, there were on
the opening day less than 2000, and many, of those
were from local clubs. Nor was the oratory of the
cccrsion in any way superior to the assembly. In
stead of an array of men who could speak with au
ti ority for the party there were only a lot of freak
stump speakers like "Ham" Lewis and "Golden Rule"
Jones.
There is something surprising in all that, and it is
net eas> to understand it. Indiana has been for many
a year the storm center of American politics. In no
other State are Presidential elections carried on with
anything like the fervor and the uproar that mark
the struggles for the Hoosier vote. During the/Oc
tobers of bygone Presidential years the contests in In
diana have been so lively that speechmaking and
parading were going on every night. Even in the
remotest rural districts the schoolhouses were re
rounding with political oratory at least four times a
wÂ»ek, and it was no trouble at all to get 2000 men to
gether at any sort of a county rally. What has come
over Indiana, what has come over Democracy, that a
great national convention of organized clubs held in
the capital of the State fails to make a showing much
larger than could have been brought to the city in
ordir.ary times by a fairly good circus?
The disappointment caused by the lack of numbers
and enthusiasm in the convention appears to have de
pressed the speakers. Ham Lewis is not a statesman,
but he is one of the most picturesque figures in politi
cal life, and as a stump speaker he ranks among the
frst. Even the talk-wearied members of CongVess
used to leave the cloakrooms and the corridors and
throng the House when Ham Lewis had the floor. As
for Golden Rule Jones, he is an exhorter of national
renown. His campaign for Governor in Ohio demon
strated an ability for racy speech of a telling kind.
Yet b8th of these'men spoke on the first day at In
dianapolis without saying anything worth the saying
or arousing any enthusiasms or even tumult among
the listeners.
Lewis, it appears, contented himself with telling a
lot of funny stories which amused the crowd, and then
Jones began to preach to them. He is quoted as say
ing: "I am a socialist; I am a patriotâ not a partisan
of any sort â and I have no hope in any party that now
is or ever shall be. My hope is in the good that is in
the human whole. I believe that on this continent
and under our flag is yet to be reared the co-operative
commonwealth that has been the dream of poets and
sages and prophets of all ages."
Such sentiments are not calculated to rouse party
enthusiasm, so it is not surprising the Democrats did
not greet them with cheers that make the "welkin
ring." There was a torchlight procession at night
that appears to have. been a fairly good show, and
with that much of success) the Bryanites will have to
be content.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Saying "Bad luck to Dan Donigan" or swearing at
Boss Croker will do no good in a matter of this kind.
The Times estimates that Tammany's circular will
raise for that organization from city officials only a
sum- of upward of $500,000. To that will be added
ruany other sums, for of course the Wiskinkie will
walk around by the -saloons, the gambling-houses and
oilier illicit places with as much alacrity as through
the departments of the city government. So large a
sum will go far to help the Bryanite campaign. It
therefore behooves the good citizen to be vigorous ?n
the fight to head off Bryanism and Tammany. The
issue is urgent, for ihe Wiskinkie'll get you â if 3-ou
don't look out.
So long as the Wiskinkie walks only in New York
we have in the matter only a curious interest;
but should Bryan be elected and the whole Federal
official world pass under control of Tammany, then
we shall see the Wiskinkie throwing legs across the
continent. Who shall be safe then?
From the simple statement "few Tammany men
ever refuse" it is easy to draw the conclusion that the
creature is one of the cakewalkers who takes the cake
every time. Beyond doubt the thing is a holy ter
ror, but whether Dan Donigan brought it from the
bogs of Ireland or bought it from Barnum's mu
seum we cannot say. It may be a hyena, or it may
be a fellow with a bit of a stick. It is sufficient to know
that when it walks the boldest tremble, and it warbles
the simple ballad, "Throw up your hands and give us
all you have."
Now concerning what sort o*f creature the Wis
kinkie may be there is no explanation given. There
is indeed in the article from which we quote a casual
statement that the Wiskinkie dates from "the days of
old when Dan Donigan went round and collected
money from officials who were backward in pay
ment," but no information is vouchsafed as to who
Dan Donigan was, or how long a time has passed
since the "old days." In the absence of any descrip
tion a cartoon would have been gratefully received,
tut even that has not been furnished. It seems to
have been regarded as all sufficient in New York to
make a simple announcement of the fact that if Tam
many's officials do not put up the coin requested by
the appreciative sachems the Wiskinkie will walk
round.
Commenting upon the circular and describing the
manner of its operation the Times states that Tam
ir.any expects from each of the faithful 5 per cent of
his annual salary. It adds: "The usual system
adopted is for some official in each department to
agree to hold himself responsible for the collection
and delivery of the money to the Tammany treasury.
As each official pays his assessment his name is
checked off the roll. Those who do not pay are noti
fied that cash is expected, and if this does not prove
effectual the Wiskinkie is sent around with the 'black
list' to make collections. Any man who refuses is
booked for severe discipline or the loss of his job.
Few Tammany men ever refuse."
NEW YORK papers announce that Tammany
Hall has sent round to all the city officials who
owe their positions to that organization a cir
cular which among other things says: "You are
known by the undersigned to be attached to our
cause, and your adherence to Democratic principles
has been shown heretofore by appreciated contribu
tions. We therefore feel warranted in again solicit
ing from you this year, so important to the Democ
racy, such a contribution as you may be pleased to
make for the purposes hereinbefore stated. You have
our assurance that every dollar raised will be pru
dently and economically expended."
THE WISKINKIS WfJLKS.
Fifthâ Because the Democratic party, to
which I have given a life service, is tra
ditionally an expansion party, and the ac
quisition of the Philippine Islands is in
direct line with its traditions and doctrine:
doctrine that was not only promulgated
by the mentor and leading lights of tha
party, but has been incorporated into
Democratic platforms.
Fourthâ It would he much more absurd
to surrender our possession to Aguinaldo
ar/d his marauding band of Interlopers,
after his more worthy and intelligent peo
ple have accepted the situation and arc
in favor of sustaining our Government,
merely because they impudently demand
as a right tho privilege of establishing an
independent government on American ter
ritory, than it would be to yield to tho
demands of the Alaskan Indians to set up
an independent government in Alaska. To
such demand I apprehend rfone of our
Democratic friends would think of acced
ing, notwithstanding the Alaskans are
"to the manner born." while Aguinaldo,
the Malay, and his followers are inter
lopers.
selves, -which -would certainly ensue If the
Tagallos should undertake to assert sov
ereignty over the other tribes, to say noth
ing of the humiliation of the American
people In surrendering their territory to
semi-savages, as Agulnaldo and his mur
derous band have proven themselves to
be in their barbarous treatment of Ameri
can prisoners, and the manner In which
they are now assassinating .American cit
izens and soldiers, and those of their own
people who have declared in favor of the
American Government.
It is gratifying to note that the efforts The Call has
made in the past to bring about the suppression of
Kinyounism in this city have been cordially seconded
in this instance by the Chronicle and the Bulletin.
Both of those journals have warmly condemned the
indignities offered by the quarantine officers to the
passengers of the Coptic and other steamers. ifi
short, the demand for Kinyoun's removal is well nigh
unanimous, and steps to achieve that end should be
taken at once.
There is no reason why there should be any delay
in dealing with offenses of this kind. Therefore it
would be well for both the Republican State Commit
tee and the Democratic State Committee to send to
Washington a statement of his misconduct, together
with a notice of the public demand for his removal.
There is no partisan feeling in the matter. It is, in
fact, one in which the two State committees might
even unite in a joint l-ote. Citizens of all parties are
wearied of the misconduct of Kinyoun, and hi;
prompt removal from an office whose powers he
misuses would be hailed as a public benefit.
San Francisco is a large city, while Kinyoun is a
small sort of a man, and under ordinary circumstances
our people could well afford to despise his malevo
lence. His official position, however, gives him power
to inflict grievous injuries upon the whole commu
nity. He has done his worst in the past to give the
impression that bubonic plague was raging here, and
his present tactics arc almost as serious a wrong. It
is time to bej?in to deal with Kinyoun in earnest. He
is unfit for the office; he is a menace to the prosper
ity of the port, and his removal should be insisted
t'pon by all parties.
QUARANTINE OFFICER KINYOUN his
once more given an illustration of his utter
unfitness for the office he holds, and this time
the exhibition has been' one of a particularly offensive
character. From the reports and complaints made by
passengers on the Coptic of the indignities to which
they were subjected by Kinyoun's subordinates it ap
pears that a gross outrage has been committed as
well as an act of official imbecility.
Ever since Dr. Kinyoun joined in the efforts of the
Board of Health to excite a bubonic plague scare in
this city, and had his ignorance of such subjects ex
pesed by the press, he has been seemingly animated
by a desire to injure the city in every and any way
possible. The manner in which the passengers on
the Coptic were treated will be reported far and wide,
and as a consequence other persons who are coming
from the Orient or from any of the Pacific islands to
the United States will seek admission at some other
port than this. No one will willingly expose him
self to the indignities as well as the delays of Kin
youn's quarantine, and accordingly the stream of pas
senger travel will to a considerable extent at least be
deflected elsewhere.

IN a letter of resignation addressed to
the Iroquols Club, the leading Sacra
mento Democratic organization, Judge
Hinkson states that he adheres to the
opinion that, not only as a wise politi
cal and commercial measure but as a
duty -to the inhabitants of the Phllippino
Islands, the islands should be retained
as United States territory and should be
governed as our other territories are gov
erned. Judge Hinkson writes that tho
Philippine Islands should be retained:
First â For the same reasons which
actuated the American people in forci
bly, and against the will of the Indians,
and at the expense of- many bloody wars,
in wresting their country from* them and
forcing them to submit to such laws as,
under the right of "power," and as a duty
to ourselves and to civilization, we were
pleased to enact for their government,
and because we could govern them better
than they could govern themselves.
Secondâ Because the remnant of the oÂ«o
tribe that is in â¢ rebellion, of the sixty
tribes of those islands, are Malay and Tar
tar interlopers Into the Philippine Islands,
and are there voluntarily, and therefore
are entitled to such rights only as the
Government in its wisdom may concedo
to them. *
Thirdâ Because of the eight millions of
tho inhabitants (a majority of whom are
less civilized, less intelligent and less cap
able of se,lf-eovernment than were tho
Indians), a remnant of the tribe which
constitutes less than one-sixth of the pop
ulation, arrogantly demands that we shall
haul down our flag and surrender to them
the territory which we purchased from
the government to which it legally and
legitimately belonged. This, not only
that they may undertake the hopeless
task of governing themselves, without
experience or true knowledge of free in
stitutions, or the principles of a repub
lican government, but to govern the other
fifty-nine tribes, nearly every one of which
is hostile to them as well as to each other,
and at the expense of interminable an
archy and endless wars among them-
Ex-Superior Judge A. C. Hinkson
of Sacramento, who has been a stal
wart Democrat all his life, has re
nounced that party and declared his
intention to vote for William McKin
ley for President at the November
election. He declares he has al
ways trained and fought under the
Democratic banner and that he had
stood by Bryan even after Bryan had
declared against expansion, hoping
and believing that his views would
be modified by the Democratic plat
form, but he avers that he cannot fol
low the candidate into "the deep
waters into which the Democrats
have launched their new craft, and
Â¦which they have overladen -with re
trogression." Judge Hinkson was
cne of the vice presidents at the meet
ing in Sacramento addressed by-
Bryan on the occasion of his first
campaign.
EX-JUDGE HINKSON RENOUNCES
BRYAN FOR PRESIDENT McKINLEY
- â¢ > a
A Democrat All His Life, but Will Cast a Re
publican Vote in November.
IN 1896 labor was largely unemployed. A majority,
of the men who were at work were on reduced
wages and short time. No memory is so short or
defective or so addled by prejudice as not to go back
clearly to that distressing time and recall its condi
tions. '
Upon those conditions Bryan then relied for election.
His greatest crowds were where labor's, distress was
the keenest. He told laborers that their idleness and
misery were due to the refusal of the Government to
coin silver free, at the ratio of 16 to i. He told them
they were victims of "the crime of 1873," and that
their oppressor was ihe gold standard.
He denounced low prices as the result of that stan
dard. In his acceptance speech in Madison-square
Garden he said: "We believe that while the struggle
for gold goes on other things must become cheap,
and as we increase the demand for gold it must de
crease the price of all those things which are ex
changed for gold. We believe that the falling of
prices is destructive of the energies, industries and
hopes of the toiling masses of the United States and
the world."
Now under the gold standard prices have risen an
average of 50 per cent since 1896. Labor, then un
employed and with nothing to buy with, largely
dependent on charity, or upon work planned and exe
cuted for charitable purposes, like the Balboa boule
vard in this city, is now employed, not only at wages
far above the average then, but with the opportunity
to work every day, and in many lines at overtime for
extra pay.
In this situation Colonel Bryan finds a grievance in
high prices as he did in low prices in 1896 when he
talks to laboring men, but when he talks to farmers
and primary producers he tells them prices for what
they sell are not high enough. Wheat, beef, mutton,
pork, wool and corn have advanced in the hands of
the producer an average of about 36 per cent. Cot
ton has advanced in the hands of the planter 100 per
cent. As Bryan said four years ago that "falling of
prices is destructive of thp energies, industries, and
hopes of the toiling, masses of the United States and
the world," it is evident that he meant that rising
prices were promotive of the energies, industries and
hopes of the toiling masses. But to-day he is de
nouncing high prices as the sum of all villainies! It
U a work of difficulty to have patience with a man
who is a pretender to the Presidency and who regu
larly swallows himself, turns on his tracks and plays
demagogue, as he does.
Four years ago he said the gold standard had emp
tied the dinner-pail 01 the laborer.
At Kansas City he addressed several thousand
packing-house workmen, a class of well paid labor,
saying: '"If we ask the Republicans why for
three and a half years they have failed to give the
laboring man' protection from government by injunc
tion the only answer is that the laboring man has a
full dinner-pail, and he ought not to object to govern
ment by injunction if the dinner-pail is full. But, my
friends, the dinner-pail argument is an insult to the
workingman, and the dinner-pail argument will not
last through this campaign. I want to ask the la
boring man if he is content to live and die with noth
ing more than a full dinner-pail. Man is of three-fold
nature; he has his body, his brains and his heart,
and the laboring man has need of something more
than three full meals a day. He needs time for intel
lectual development."
It is hardly possible that the plainest pig-sticker in
his audience does not know that preceding all intel
lectual culture or the leisure that may be used in the
higher things of life must be the provision for phy
sical existence.
It is as if Bryan ha'l said: "Your full dinner-pail is
no good; throw your abundant food awfly and culti
vate your minds." In 1896 the dinner-pail was empty.
Laborers had no work nor wages. They had all the
time there was; how much intellectual development
did they get?
They were not burdened with three full meals 1
day, nor one. They were eating the hard bread ai*i
thin soup of charity, and had plenty of leisure for cul
ture.
Again, what has government by injunction to do
with them? Many own their homes. If another
persistently intrude upon their property, make it un
tenable, reduce the happiness or profit in its use, they
apply for an injunction to protect their property. It
is made perpetual and they live under what this
demagogue calls government by injunction. If_the
party enjoined continue his intrusion and annoyance
the court that issued the decree arrests and punishes
him for contempt of it? order. The injunction is for
rich and poor alike; it protects the property of all,
and there is not one-tenth of one per cent of the in
telligent supporters of Bryan who would think for a
moment of robbing courts of the right to indepen
dently enforce their decrees.
Indeed, it passes belief that any intelligent man,
who knows the origin of the rights of property and
the judicial independence required for the protection
of those rights, could think of supporting such raw,
bold demagogy and dangerous appeals to the pas
sions of men against the very institutions which pro
tect their rights.;- .'"
BRYAN AND THE L0BOR VOTE.
BROOKLYN EAGLEâ If Mr. Bryan fa
sincere he is the biggest fool whom nny
considerable party ever nominated for
high office. He has found substantially
every proposition which he advanced fon
years ago disproved by the experience of
his countrymen in the past forty-eight
months, and yet he repeats them anew
and uses what every one else regards a*
the proof of his error to substantiate tho
correctness of his assertions.
NEW YORK POSTâ Almost every day
brings news of wage scale agreements in
conference of employers and employe?,
and of strikes averted for a longer or
shorter period, while the Industrial war
which has been waging in the anthracite
fields the last fortnight furnishes a sad
example of the economic waste and need
less suffering Involved In the strike meth
od of adjusting grievances.
PHILADELPHIA ENQUIRERâ Everv

City must pay tribute through Tammany
to the campaign fund which permits Mr.
Stone to enjoy himself at the Hoffman
House. ' Mr. Cockran to travel In luxury
and Mr. Bryan to make use of a car with
palatial appointments.
BOSTON HERALDâ What we do expect
to see In the next six weeks Is a steady
weakening of the Democratic ranks wher
ever the Republicans really make a fight
to win. They have the means and the or
ganization to fight hard and successfully.
They have only begun to put forth their
power. The blunders of their opponents
will fight for them. Bryan Is the always
conspicuous blunder.
NEW YORK TRIBUNEâ What a tri
umph It would be for Industry If not nine
tenths nor three-quarters, but even one
half of the potentiality of coal could be
utilized! The cost of power would thus be
materially reduced and the final exhaus
tion of the coal depositsâ which Is merely
a question of time â would be postponed
for years, perhaps for centuries.
CLEVELAND LEADERâ Opposition to
the trusts is not a political question. Every
man who thinks right, whether he be Re
publican, . Democrat, Populist or Prohi
bitionist. Is agalÂ»st the monopolistic com
binations of capital. Bryan makes a po
litical question of It simply because he
represents the party that is out.
NEW YORK PRESSâ The flreless

winter, like the empty cupboard In thÂ»
Pennsylvania mining patch, will be duo

of the Bryanlte politician's belief that out
of the human misery of industrial strife

CHICAGO TRIBITXEâ Many *ad words

be timely for the Pacific Coast delegations at the na
tional capital to insist that the coast shall have a
representative upon the commission. This part of
the Union is perhaps more seriously affected by
freight discriminations than any other in the Union,
because it is furthest from the centers of -population
where the great markets are. In the increased orders
for freightcars, therefore, we may see a proof of an
increased need for Pacific Coast men to get together
and stand together in defense of Pacific Coast inter
ests. We may be sure that when all the thousands of
new locomotives and freightcars are ready for the
roads and for business there arc going to be a great
many readjustments in transportation, and we, must
be prepared to protect our interests,' for no one else
will.

ADV3RTI3EMENT3.The new company has had a representa
tive in this city for some time and he
has secured the necessary docking- facili
ties in this city as well as In Vallejo. The
company's charter permits it to operate a
system of passenger and freight boats not
only on the San Francisco Bay and ad
jacent waters but also to any part of the
world. â¢ .-â¢
In addition to the passenger service the
company is to make a feature of the
freight department There is a great deal
of traffic between this city and San Pablo
Bay points, and It Is proposed to take all
the protltablfe freight that goes between
the two places.
The ultimate intention of the company
is to extend its scope to take in the coast
wise trade in addition to the local busi
ness.
H. B. Sharp of thla city Is to be the
general manager in all probability. He Is
the originator of the scheme. The com
pany will purchase one fast steamer ira-
San Francisco, Marc Island and Vallejo
will be the landing points of a new pas
senger and freight steamboat line that
â¢will soon begin operation. A syndicate
composed of New York and San Francisco
capitalists has taken hold of the project
and articles of Incorporation have Just
been obtained in New Jersey. The. cor
poration will be known as the California

(Concluded.)
Ever smce the days when Adam set
forth from Eden man has loved the ex
citement and the joy of adventure and
daring travel. Hence in every age of the
world there have been those who have
taken their lives in their hands, and.
Journeying forth into parts of the world
remote from the scones of their youth,
have braved perils and even death in the
hope of being able to go' where man had
never been before and see things which
man had never seen before.
It has been from the enthusiasm of ad
venturous spirits such as these that the
extension of geographical knowledge
which most strikingly affects the Imagina
tion of the world In general has had its
origin. Columbus was among these spirits.
So, too, were Cabots and Sir
Francis Drake. So, too. were Prince Fer
dinand of Portugal and Vasco da Gama.
So, too, were Sir Walter Raleigh, Henry
Hudson and Captain Cook. And so have
been many others who have won fame
as the*e men won it â by dint of their
ardor for discovering and exploring parts
unknown.
In the field of geographical exploration
the century opened with the exploits of
Alexander von Humboldt, In whom the
ardor of the discoverer and explorer con
joined with an intense scientific ardor and
a high power of felicitous literary expres
sion to produce perhaps the greatest and
most remarkable contributor to geograph
ical knowledge the world has ever known.
Humboldfs travels and observationsâ In
the West Indies. In South America and
In Mexico â constituted a new era in geo
graphical effort. But Humboldt's work
for geography was not most character
istically seen In what he did for the mere
extension of its domain, in the numberless
items of positive information which he
contributed to Its store. His most note
worthy achievement lay In the two fact3
(1) that he was perhaps the first of all
the great geographers to deal with geo
graphy as an exact science, and (2> that
he made the scientific side of geographi
cal study popular with the masses of the
people. Captain Ccok was the only man
antecedent to Humboldfs time whope
work for geography was at all compar
able with his. But even Cook's work,
great as It was, was slight compared with
that of Humboldt.
An "ignis fatuus" of geographical ex
plorers for many years was the hope of
discovering a "northwest passage" from
the Atlantic to the waters of Asia. In
the first third of the century there were
many expeditions that had for their ob
ject thisâ as Â«? now know It to beâim
practicable achievement. Among the
more" famous of these were the various
expeditions commanded by the two
Rosses. Sir John and Sir James, and their
friend Parry. Though all the "northwest"
expeditions commanded by these famous
navigators were failures, so far as their
main object was concerned, nevertheless
they all were extremely useful In making
known and definite the geographical fea
tures of the northern part of this conti
nent. It should be borne in mind that It
was Sir James Ross who. In 1S31, won the
great distinction of locating the north
magnetic pole. On the 1st of June of that
year he fixed the flag of his nation at a
Â¦ spot in Boothia Felix where he found the
"dip" of the magnetic needle of the sur
veyor's compass to be so great that the
i needle stood on end and pointed vertically
I downward.
But the principal interest of the world
in Northwest discovery attaches to the
ill-fated expedition which in 1*43 set out
.from England to effect the passage to
Asia by way of Arctic waters under the
command of ths veteran explorer Sir
John Franklin. After the ships of this
expedition had entered Davis Straits they
never were seen again. There were three
years of anxious waiting. Then it was
known that they had met with some fatal
mishap. Expedition after expedition was
sent out to obtain if possible some trace
of the heroic navigator, his men or his
ships, but it was not until 1S35 that any
positive information as to the fate of the
lost ones could be obtained. And this in
formation, sad as it was. was as meager
as it was sad. It was learned that every
soul had perishf-d. and that was all. And
yet Franklin and his fellow heroes had
solved the problem they had set out to
solve. They had passed from Atlantic
waters to Pacific waters. But the prob
lem, though solved, was useless. The
achievement could never be practically re
peated.
A second great field of geographical ex
ploration and discovery in the nineteenth
century has been the Antarctic Ocean.
Especially was this so in the twenty-five
years that extended from 1S20 to 1S43. The
principal hero of Antarctic discovery so
far has been Sir James Ross, of magnetic
pole fame, but the regions of the Antarc
tic seas are still in great part unknown.
It is supposed that a vast mass of land
au continent, one larger. Indeed, than the
continent of Australiaâ surrounds the
south pole, but this is in reality only a
surmise. If land does exist there (its ex
istence Is merely inferred from geological
indicationsâ It has been actually seen in
only one or two places) it is supposed to
be in large part covered with ice of great
thicknessâ from twelve to twenty-four
miles of thickness, as some say. But all
this is only conjecture. Little positive
knowledge of the region has been obtain
ed. "Antarctica" Is to-day the one great
remaining "terra Incognita" of the; world.
A third great field of geographical
achievement has been Asia. In Indiaâ
Not* â An examination upon this course
| as a basis for the granting of certificate'*
will be published on Friday, October 12.
Perhaps, however, particular mention
i should be made of Australia. That gre:ir
continent was at the be:?innln?T of the cen-
I tury. except for one or two points on in
j extreme outer pdsres. altogether unknown.
: Its general contour, however, was known.
I but as its* possession lay in the hands nl
! Great Britain It was a region of no great
; concern to the rest of tne world. And Â«tÂ»,
; though in Australia the course of rp>
; graphical exploration and discovery sin re?
i the beginning of the century has been as
! active and as remarkable as elsewhere, it
j has made but little impression upon the
j popular imagination elsewhere. Australia
1 Is to-day what it has b^en from almo>r
the beginning of its historyâ a land of
which the rest of the world has vasu"Â»
.Ideas and uncertain knowledge. Its maps
f have remained always the ?am<*. exrent ;a

Philadelphia.
There have been, of course, during thÂ«
last ICO years many instances of daring
enterprise undertaken Jn behalf of the ex
tension of geographical knowledge othtr
1 than those mentioned in the preceding
paragraphs. But those mentioned have
been the most conspicuous ones â that is
to say. thf have been those which have
most noticeably affected popular cartog
raphy. Such expeditions as those of
Greely. Peary and Nar.sen to the Arctic
regions in recent years, though of the
highest scientific importance, do not im
press the popular Imagination in that
most effective of all ways in respect M
things geographical â namely, tne making
of maps. Our knowledge of the cin-um
.polar regions of the north, while from
year to year it is getting more and more
precise, still remains in its general fea
tures much the same as it was in Frank
lin's time.
When Livingstone. Baker and Stanley
were finishing th^ir labors Africa w,n
still In great measure an unappropriated
natural domain. Eut since 1SS0, or. more
properly speaking, since 1SSÂ», an impor
tant change has been brought about In
the map of Africa. The great nations of
Europe, especially Great Britain. Franco
and Germany, have assumed sovereignty
over vast regions which ever before had
been without regular government or with
out other government than such as white
men deem to be uncivilized. .Africa to
day is thoroughly partitioned. Scarcely n
square mile of It remains (except in tha
extreme north) that is not parceled out as
the domain of some European power. In
this respect, however. Africa ia but the
subject of a destiny which, in one form or
other, has been common to all the other
continents of the wor!<i save Europe and
Asia.
India is, indeed, a- leader in this phase
ot vÂ«'"HTHt>lii<-:ii worn, ami thf fact snuulil
he mentioned in any general survey of
the world's geographical achievement,
however slight. But outside of India the
inwiiiist ..t tno wcrlil in respect to Asia
remains pretty much the same â in kind,
that is to sayâ as It was a hundred years
ago. although a number of individual
travelers have given us much new posi
tive information respecting Central Asia
âTibet, the Pamir tableland. Turkestan.
Afghanistan, etc. Asiatie civilization is
moribund, or at best inert. It neither ad
vances of Its own vitality nor assimilates
the vitality of western civilization. On
the surface of the globe Asia may be de
picted as for the most part one vast area
of intellectual stagnation.
The greatest of all fields of geographical
achievement in this century has teen
Africa, In that continent alone have the
exploits of explorers and discoverers
equaled in greatness of conception. !n
daringness of attempt. In success of exe
cution, in magnitude of result the exploits
of the hero explorers and discoverers of
former centuries â of Drako and Raleigh,
for example, or of Cook cr James Bruce.
The list of African explorers whose ;l!s
coveries have add<Â»<l luster to the geo
graphical annals of this century is a long
and almost continuous one. Bevrinrung
with the youthful hero Mungo Park, who
perished on the Miserâ the great river

ever, and this drove the Rang_jy and the
Marion against the tide until they both
lay bows on to the city.
The Ranger's anchor was foul and she
commenced to drift do%vn on the Marion.
Before anything could be done she struck
the naval reserve ship on the port quarter
and fouled the boats that were hanging
there in the davits. In the meantime the
Ranger's engine had been started,' and as
she drew astern she raked the Marion
with her Jibboom right down her port
side, carrying away some of her head
gear and her lighter rigging. The jibboom
of the Ranger was sprung and her head
gear was damaged. The Marion had also
two boats crushed and a pair of heavy
davits bent.
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
THK Wisconsinn returned from
Seattle early yesterday morning
after a great run down of flfty
eight hours. She went right up
the bay and anchored in her old
berth off the Union Iron Works.
The battleship is in good trim after her
run north. Her officers and men have
nothing but praise for the way she be
haved. On the way up she ran into the
big storm of September 23 and 24. She left
hero Saturday/ September 22, and was
well up the coast when she struck the
gale. It was a terrlfic*blow, but the big
battleship behaved splendidly. She proved
herself a wonderful seaboat and as quick
to obey her helm as a yacht.
For hours she bucked, into the big seas,
going easily at ten knots with seventy
four turns to the minute and taking ver..'
little water aboard. But the storm grew
worse and soon the green seas were com
ing in over the bow and rushing aft as
far as the superstructure. There was
nothing forward they could hurt, how
ever, so she kept on. She shipped some
big ones, though, among them being one
that climbed aft as far as the big turret,
deluged the men on watch on the flying
bridge fifty feet above the water line and
more than one hundred feet aft of the
bow, and then flying higher and farther
it lapped over the two immense funnels
and left the superstructure deck awash.
Another sea soon afterward broke nearly
as high and as far aft, but the battleship
shook herself free of them and kept on
as if they were nothing. In the morning
when the sun came out the drenched fun
nels dried in streaks and they still show
the white crystals of salt left by the big
waves that came aboard.
The Wisconsin was live days in the dry
dock at Port Orchard. During that time
excursions were run from the Sound
cities, and on Sunday last there were be
tween live and six hundred visitors
aboard. She did no fast work during her
trip north nor In the Sound, but on her
way to an anchorage from the drydock
she picked up her heels a little hjt, and
with ninety turns 6he easily made thir
teen knots. Those who made the trip
with her are confident she will bring a
handsome bonus for extra speed above
the sixteen knots called for by the con
tract.
The Wisconsin will at once prepare for
her run against time in Santa Barbara
channel. She will take her bunkers full
of coal and will probably limber up her
machinery a bit by short runs in the bay
before starting south Tuesday. The
Ranger, Philadelphia and Iowa will ac
company her and will act as stakeboats
along the course. >..

The next one, which is an excursion to
Old Mexico, though the last thus far an
nounced for the year, will perhaps be of
greater importance than any or all which
have preceded it, because of its enlarged
scope and the significant International in
terests involved. It is not presumed that
this event will be a pleasure jaunt merely.
There are the best of reasons why
stronger commercial relations should be
established between California and Mex
ico, and the. very low rate for this occa
sion, together with the delightful con
veniences and abundance of time which
the special train will afford, should induce
business men in all departments of trade

For the information of those Interested
a little book will fce mailed free by ad-
dressing F. A. Stuart Co.. Marshall. Mich.,
giving briefly the ss-mptems of the various
forms of stomach weakness, causes and
cure.
T*ie merit end success of Stuart'r Dva-
pepsia Tablets are world wide and' they
are sold at the moderate price of 50 cts
for full sized package in every drujr store
In the United States and Canada, as well
is in Europe.
One grain of the active principle In Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest . SO'O
srrains of mcut, eg^s or othfr wholesome
fond, and this claim has been proven by
actual experiment which any one can per-
form for himself In the following manner;
Cut hard boiled egjf into very small pieces,
as it would be if masticated, place the egg
ant?, two or three of the tablets In a bottle
or jar contalnlnB warm water heated to
OS derrrees (the temperature of the body*
and keep It at thisi temperature for threo
and one-half hours, at the end of which
time the egs will be as completely digest-
ed as it would have been In the healthy
stomach of a hungry boy.
The pcint of this experiment Is* that
what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do
to the eRs: In the bottle It will do to tho
egg or meat in the stomach and nothing
el5e w'H rest and invigorate the stomach
so safely ar.d effectually. Even a little
child can take Stuart's Tablets with
safety and bert^fit if Its digestion la weak
and the thousands of cures accomplished
by their regular dally use are easily ex-
plained when It is understood that they
nro composed of vegetable essences, asep-
tic pepsin. . diastase and Golden SÂ»-al.
â¢vhich mingles with the food and dise^t
it thoroughly, giving the overworked
stomach a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neither
do pllla and cathartic medicines, which
simply irritate and Inflame the intestines.
When enough food Is eaten and promptly
digested there will be no constipation, nor
in fact will there b*Â» disease of any kind
because good digestion means good "health
in every organ.

AYrx' York Stock Market.
N'EW YORK. Oct. 4â To-day's stock market
had to undergo the Ftress of realizing profit,
which was the natural sequence of yester
day's successful manipulation for the advance.
The dimensions of the upward movements
Â¦were EUfSclently Impressive to attack a con
siderable outside demand for stocks and the
first hour of the market saw very active trad-
Ins with very small fluctuations In price after
the openinjr. which was made higher to facil
itate the taking of profits. The general deÂ«
rr.and was judiciously fed by the professional
cjierators in order not to discourage the buy
ing, but before the end of the hour an Impres
sion hefian to be made in the railroad libt.
f^eUinji fÂ«.>r London account was an additional
factor toward depression. When prices fell
back to about last night's level the selling
jircpsure was relaxed. The bulls then turned
their attention to other quarters of the mar
ket. biddinK up prices actively wherever aay
fiens of t-tr?npth showed in order to support
lound the best tieid tor theÂ«=e operations In the
Etee) and iron group. Various factors com-
Mned to give strength to these stocks. The
final (settlement of the tin plate wase Fcale
v. : s ft stimulatins: influence, not only in those
Ftookii but throuKhout the j^roup. Susar and
People's GaE wrre very feverish all day as a
consequence of the cut In refined sugars and
the legal e:eps taken in the gat. war In Chi
cago. Hugar has a small net Rain and Peo
ple's Gas a small net lo?Â«. With the excep
tion of wide movements in some of the closely
lie!d dormant stocks thÂ« railroads continued
s'.uBgish during the latter jart of the day.
The local traction stocks were strong and
showed evidence of manipulation. The whole
market ran off at the close, which was eaby
and active. The decision of the directors of
the IJaxik of England to leave the official rate
unchanged a.t 4 iiÂ«t rent was accepted favor
ably by the bulls, who argued that It in
pured imports of gold, but the sterling ex
change market unexpectedly developed a firmer
ti'ne and the rate for demand bills recov
ered *Â»c.
The bond market continued irrecular and
not very active. Total sales, par value, tl,

CHICAGO, Oct. 4.â The wheat market was.
a dull affair throughout. Under influence of
an advance at Liverpool and unfavorable
weather In the Northwest November opened at

side, however, and as the outside furnished
nothing In the way of buying ordera to coun
teract this the early strength was lost. At
77Â»iJ3 77%c the market steadied for a time be
cause the Eeaboard reported 7C0.0C0 busheib
taken for export, but the steadiness failed to
hold against the speculative dullness and a
further decline to 7?%077%C followed. The
close was steady, November UÂ©%c lower at.

corn was quiet. The close was steady: No

MUS. POWELL PACKED
UP AND LEFT HOME
Marriage That Was a Great Society
Event Ends in a Suit for
Divorce.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 4.â Society is to be
taken aback by the announcement that
Mr. and Mrs. James A. Powell have dis
agreed, have separated, and will probably
be divorced.. They have both enjoyed
high standing in local' society. The hus
band seeks the divorce from his wife on
the ground of desertion.
In his complaint the husband states
that during one of their many spats Mrs.
Powell declared that she would leave him
and never come back. She followed up
her threat by packing her belongings and
departing from the Powril domicile at
2260 Central avenue. Mr. Powell docs not
know his wife's whereabouts. Mrs. Pow
ell's relatives said nothing about her dif
ficulties with her husband and It va<s
generally supposed among her friends
that she had gone to New York to sell
some paintings in the possession of the
Nahl family, of which she is a member.
The Powells were married in Alameda
on June 19, 1897. The wedding was a so
ciety event. It took place at the Nahl
residence, which was recently destroyed
by fire. Mrs. Powell was the daughter
of the late Arthur Nahl, the famous
artist, and Is the sister of Perham and
Virgil Nahl, well-known newspaper ar
tists. When the fire in the Nahl residence
destroyed a large number of pictures it
was thought that some of the master
pieces in the Nahl collection had gone up
in smoke, too, but afterward it was stated
that Mrs. Powell had' taken them East
with her to dispose of. t
Mr. Powell is a concrete work con
tractor. His Interests in the divorce suit
will be looked after by Cotton & Perry.
I DR. O. 8. DEAN. PRESIDENT
ALAMEDA COUNTY CHR1S
| TIAN ENDEAVOR UNION.
WOULD HAVE POSTOFFICE
CLOSED ON THE SABBATH
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â The Alameda
County Chnstlan Endeavor
Union has Btarted a movement
to have the Oakland Postofflo?
Closed all day Sundays. In order
to secure data upon which to work Dr. O.
S. Dean, the president of the union, made
a canvass last Sunday of those who ap
plied for their mall on the Sabbath. The
result of this canvass showed that seven
eighths of the people who came to the
postofflce on Sunday were church-going
people.
The plan Is that by Dr. O. S. Dean,
president of the organization, assisted by
Arthur Humphrey, Christian Endeavor
superintendent of Lord's day observance,
and E. Lyon, past president, who mapped
out a method of operation, which was put
Into effect last Sunday.
At that time members from the Chris
tian Endeavor societies of every church In
Oakland took their station In the post
offlce corridor, counted the number of ap
plicants for mail and noted the name of
each church member who called.
"Three hundred persons called or sent
for their mall last Sunday," said Dr.
Dean. "Of ttiat number se- en-eighths
were, by actual count, church-going peo
ple. During that day not over twelve
business men asked for their letters. Our
Investigation shows that we are right In
our contention that it !s the church peo
ple who keep the postofflce open and pre
vent the clerks from attending religious
services. Postmaster Friend has said that
if there Is not a sufficient number of ap
plicants at the office delivery on Sunday
to warrant keeping the window open 83
a matter of public convenience he will
close the postofflce on that day. The mat
ter is in the hands of the church people.
"We have discovered some amusing
things In the course of our Inquiries. A
number of people, known to the clerks,
call at the office every Sunday without
fall: yet they do not get mail on any day
more than once In three months. Two per
sons with whom I have talked this week
admitted that they arranged to have their
letters come on Sunday, because It gave
them more pleasure to receive them on
that day."
Arthur Humphrey, superintendent of
Lord's day observance. Is taking an act
ive part in the Sunday closing movement
He said:
"Next week we shall distribute In each
of the local churches cards asking the
members not to call at the postofflce on
Sunday, and explaining- the Importance of
their complying with the request. We are
going to work earnestly and feel sure of
success."
Christian Endeavor Union of Alameda
Starts Movement to Effect That End.
"Of course, the employes of the post
office are very anxious to have Sundav i<\
a holiday." said the Postmaster. "They
are no more fond of working on that day
than other men. The postofflcc. however.
Is to a great extent the servant of tho
people. Whether or not the postoffiVe
shall be open on Sundays fs a question for
Its patrons to determine."
Postmaster Friend pays he will follow
the consensus of public opinion In the
matter.
E. Lyon, who originated the crusade
against Sunday delivery, has done good
work for the cause In Ins own church.
"Last Sunday not a member of the First
Baptist Church, which I attend, was to oe
seen at the delivery window." said Mr.
Lyon. "Two-thirds oÂ» those who came
were from one church. I suppose the
proximity of that place of worship to tho
postofflce had something to do with thj
proportion."

JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
Â¦Worthy Candidates "Who "Would Serve
In voting for candidates for Justice of
tr-.e Peace the citizens of San Francisco
Â¦will pay Blight attention to party
nomtoAUons. Five justices are to be
â¢ h- sen and eleven candidates are In
the field. Five were nominatfd by Martin
Ke'.iy':; B'nal IVrith Hall Republican
convention and five others secured noml
nation* from Gavin McNab's Democratic
convention, and one candidate. G. W. F.
Cook is th* nominee <>t the convention ol
th< C;!z. n?' P.epublican party.
In alerting five to be voted for the
elector? 'hmild rut tx? governed by parti
fan considerations. It is the rankest
nnnper:?*- to maintain that the Republican
nations 1 licket will be imperiled or the
election of a Republican nominee for Con
g,liLM rendered doubtful by independent
action of the voters In making non-parti
tan selections for the Judiciary.
In a general sense it ran be saM that
worthy candidates have been nominated.
Young lawyers of merit and promise have
been recognized: Native Sons who have
hnd the advantage of university educa
lions in California are well represented In
the Ufi of nominees. It Is clearly the duty
Â«>f tho voter to scan the list, make diligent
inquiry regarding th*Â» fitness of each
nominee, and vote for the best five candi
date?, regardless of their party affiliation.
There are degrees of fitness so far as
tru-Mai equipment Is concerned for the
r.ffiee of Justice of th*Â» P<*ace. Some of
the candidates, no doubt, are better quali
1,<-><1 than others by reason of experienc**
ar:d knowledge in the law. As to the
filiation of hones-ty. then* are no grades.
The candidates cannot 1>^ graded or clas
sified in group?, indicating the honest, the
f:iir!y honest and the dishonest. The
rnrr.lni-f- is either straight e>r crooked.
This journal :.Â° rot In possession of proof
to justify thÂ«Â» assertion that any one of
the eleven candidates is dishonest. If a
crook were running for the office and this
paper had knowledge of his crookedness
there would be no hesitancy in giving the
public the benefit of such knowledge.
There is a d<*al of talk about Justices of
the Peace who stnnd in with Jake Rauer.
but the accusation of complicity with the
collector of bad debts is general rather
than specific.
The fall has no hesitation In suggest
ing that five of the best nominees may
bo taken from the following list:
Percy V. Long, Thomas F. Dunn, John
Daniels. H. L, Joaehimpen. T. I. Fitz
patriok. D. S. O'Brien. G. W. F. Cook and
Joseph T. O'Connor.
The name of G. W. F. Cook was pre
sented to the Republican convention,
which met in B'nai B'rith Hall, but his
nomination was denied for the reason that
he had failed to deride a case according to
Martin Kelly's notions of law and Justice.
ThfÂ» case was one In which Kelly and the
wlilnw of Senator Mahoney were litigants,
and judgment against the boss was ren
dered by Justice Cook.
The effort in the Democratic convention
to punish W. R. Daingerfield for similar
cause was not Fuocessful, as the disap
pointed litigant did not control the works,
but in the Republican convention Kelly
mastered tho delegates and turned down
the man who declined to render Judgment
as the boss ordered.
HARMONY THAT FAILED.
Mayor Repudiated by the Dominant
Faction in the Thirty-Ninth
District.
The Democrats of tho Thirty-ninth As
sembly District have decided that har
mony is a luxury too expensive for them
to enjoy. There are two factions in the
district, and both met last night at Sara
toga Hall with a purpose of settling their
differences and continuing the campaign
as a single club. The meeting adjourned
with thÂ« factions more bitterly opposed
to one another than ever before. The ma
jority faction, which Is opposed to Mayor
Phclan and all he represents, has a club
of over 4fi>) members. Tho Phelanitefl
have a club of about 100 members and the
advantage of the organization. It was
proposed for the pake of harmony that
the Phelanites give up their club and be
absorbed by the enemy. The followers of
his Honor were perfectly willing, but at
the last moment the enemy got the sulks
and refused the glad hand.
The quarrel possesses Interest because
of the State Senatorial contest. The
Democratic nominee was placed In the
field by the Phelajiltes and naturally Is
r-xpocted to bo one of the supporters of
his Honor for a national toga. The oppo
sition therefore pledged itself not to vote
for any Senatorial aspirant who would
not bind himself to vote for Stephen M.
White for United States Senator.
Around this point the interest of the
session last night revolved. A resolution
declaring that Republican rumors to the
effect that tho club did not Intend to sup
port L. H. Ward for State Senator were
unfounded was introduced, and the storm
began. Fiery orators insisted that the
club Is a national one and local politics
has no place in its affairs. The resolution
was therefore duly burled and Immedi
ately after another resolution Indorsing
the policy of the yellow sheet in local pol
itics was adopted with a howl. This was
a plain slap at his Honor the Mayor and
all* thought of harmony was abandoned.
The meeting was then addressed briefly
by R. P. Troy. R. Porter Ashe. L. H.
Ward and II. McLaln.

BOY DENIES KNOWING
HIS OWN FONI> FATHER
Harry Harmon Refuses to Recognize
Parent' Who Comes to
Identify Him.
OAKLAND. Oct. 4.â "No. sir; I don't
know you."
Nine-year-old Harry Harmon stood In
the City Prison this afternoon and looked
directly at his father when he said this.
"You don't know me!" shouted the
father.
"No, elr; I never saw you before."
"Well, you will know that you've seen
me once when I get you home." said the
old man.
Harry Harmon came under the care of
the Oakland police last evening, when
Mrs. G. W. Atkinson of Fourth avenue
notified the City Hall police station that
a nine-year-old boy from San Francisco
was at her home with no place to go and
hopelessly lost. The police brought the
boy to the City Prison, and he told a very
straight and apparently convincing story
of having been In San Francisco but a
very few weeks,. where his father was en
gaged In digging sewers. Several days
ago he came to Oakland and had not been
able to get hack. He told a pitiful story
of having been hungry and with no place
to go, so he appealed to Mrs. Atkinson for
aid.
It was quite a pathetic story, and the
boy was given a little extra care and at
tention for a rough and tumble police sta
tion. This morning: Detective Kyte -was
put upon the case, and before the day
was over he had located W. H. Harmon,
the father of the boy, who lives on East
Eighteenth street.
The lad's home was only a few blocks
away from the place where he was ar
rested, and this seemed a little peculiar
in view of the remarkable story of priva
tion told by him. Mr. Harmon was asked
to come to the City Prison and identify
bis son.
When Mr. Harmon walked Into the pris
on he recognized his boy at once. But the
boy was not so ready with his recogni
tion, and when the father said, "What
are you doing here, Harry?" the preco
cious youngster denied his father abso
lutely. He did It with such apparent
earnestness that Detective Kyte and Cap
tain Wilson were deceived for a few mo
ments themselves. The boy stuck to hla
denial of his own father until he could
stand it no longer, and then he broke
down and admitted the whole story.
"I only did it to see how it would feel,"
whimpered the boy.
"I'll show you how it feels when you
get home." replied the father.
MRS. G. A. WIESE. WHOM THE
BULLET OF AN ENEMY JUST
! MISSED.
Tlie Lady Is Prostrated Tliro-u.gtL
Excitement.
-^
City Electrician Wiese. whose wife had
such a narrow escape from being shot.
"It occurred, my wife says, not more than
five minutes after I left the house to go
uptown at 7 o'clock. With my wife in the
house were our two boys. She was busy
In the. pantry putting some things away
when suddenly a shot rang out. followed
bv a crash of glass and then the whizz
of something by her head. She happened
to te stooping down at the time. â¢!se she
would have been stiuck. The bullet cam?
through the open window. Of couse my
wife and the children were badly fright
ened. She quickly bolted! the back dodr
and ran to summon Stuart Taylor. They
all investigated the place, but could find
no one around. It is a mysterious affair.
and I am puzzled to know what la at the
bottom of It. It doesn't seem possible
that an *nemy even would be so das
tardly as to take any of our lives by
shooting through the dark."
â¢ P. Fiegbeder. a baker, reported to the
police that a window In his bakeshop has
been broken by some miscreant, but he la
not sure that It was done last night or at
some other time.
"I did not learn of the shooting affair
until an hour after It happened," said
could not be seen. She had Just recovered
from a Ions illness and the shock was
too much for her nerves.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 4.â Mystery still
envelops the firing of the shot at
Mrs. G. A. Wiese at her home at
1255 Regent street last night. Ef
forts on the part of the police to
capture the, would-be assassin, the shot
from whose pistol or rifle came so close
to killing Mrs. "Wiesse. have failed. The
police believ'e that the rock that was cast
through the bathroom window might have
been thrown by a boy, but the shot they
cannot explain. A motive seems to be en
tirely lacking, as the Wleees have no
enemies that they know of.
"It's a puzzler," said Chief of Police
Conrad this morning, when he had com
pleted his investigation of the premises.
"We have examined the place closely to
find traces of the party responsible for
the shooting and stone-throwing, but can
find no clew. If it was only a stone that
was thrown we ' might lay it to boyish
pranks, but the presence of the bullet hole
mystifies us. The bullet evidently went
through the pane of glass in the parti
tion on the rear porch and then
through the open window of the pantry.
\\ e could not find the bullet, but Mrs.
Wiese says that she felt it whizz close by
her head. Mrs. Wiese thinks she smelled
the odcr of powder smoke when she went
out on the porch. I think she must be
mistaken about that,, however, because
it was several minutes before she got
there, and by that time the smoke had
blown away.
"Whoever fired the shot must have
stood in one of two positions. There Is
a high fence that partitions the chicken
yard on the premises from the rest of the
yard. To get the proper angle to shoot
into the pantry window a person would
have had to take up a position a hundred
yards in the rear of the house in order
to clear that high fence or stand within a
few feet of the rear of the porch. It has
been suggested that the bullet might have
come from a boy's air rifle. If it did it
could not have gone a hundred yards and
then pierced a window. And I cannot
think that a boy would be bold enough
to go into the Wiese back yard just for
the purpose of firing a shot through a
window. As for the rock that went
through the bathroom window, I think It
came from a slungshot."
The exciting events of the night pros
trated Mrs. Wiese, and to-day she was
in fcuch a precarious condition that she

ARTIST WILLIAM KEITH
ADOPTS AN ODD STYLE
Paints Some Striking Portraits With
the Depth and Somberness of
the Old Masters.
A comparatively rare exajnple of the
genius of William Keith ia to be seen this
week in the artist's studio, in the shape
of a trio of portraits of Charles A. Keeler,
the poet. Also to be seen are portraits of
Collls P. Huntington and Irving M. Scott.
The Keeler portraits are unusual and very
distinctive in handling. Painted In a rich,
warm key and with the depth and somber
ness of the old masters, these experiments
in tone are most fascinating and beauti
ful. An elusive, dreamy effect it Is. In
stead of the figure "standing out" from
the canvas â the commonplace ideal of a
whole past generation of painters â it
seems to be bathed in mysterious depths
far on the other side of the frame. The
subject is a pictqresque one, and the pic
ture portraits are yet another triumph for
our Western genius.
Frank A. McComas, but recently return
ed to San Francisco from Paris, has gone
for a short season to his Australian home.
It is understood that he will return to
California early in the spring. He takes
with him many California sketches, and
among them a very original Leona
Heights landscape. Mr. McComas is es
sentially of the modernsâ modern, and
this landscape has all the breadth of con
ception, simplicity of treatment, direct
ness and sensitive tone values that char
acterize the school.
Miss Blanche Letcher, who has achieved
considerable local distinction lately with
some clever pastel and water-color por
traits, will leave San Kranclsco next week
for New York for further study and work.
A number of examples of this clever girl's
workâ just back from the Sacramento
State Fairâ 'are to be seen in the studio
of Miss Anna Frances Briggs. Her por
traits show good drawing, a nice sense of
color and artistic place and pose.
It is understood Grace Hudson will
shortly leave Ukiah and her Indian chiefs
and princesses for a painting trip to the
Sandwich Islands, where doubtless she
will revel in the fine bronze and coppery
tints of the native beauties. Mrs. Hudson
has a new Indian picanlnny on exhibition
in one of the galleries, showing all the
tine conscientiousness and sympathy with
the subject that is characteristic of her
work.
At last hearing the proceeds from the
sale of pictures of the late artist. Ray
mond D. Yelland. at the Hopkins Art In
stitute, amounted to $2100. Other pictures,
however, have since been disposed of.
and it is estimated the sum total of the
sale so far will touch $2500.
Joseph D. Greenbaum's exhibition at a
local gallery has created considerable in
terest and proved successful financially.
To the adroit hand and brain of Board
man Michael Robinson was due no in
considerable proportion of the success of
the Carolan ball â from the artistic side of
it, that is. Many of the picturesque cof
tumes were designed by him. the scheme
of decorations planned, and even the mys
terious mazes of some of the dances or
dered in artistic evolution.
An amusing story comes down from
Nome anent the misfortunes of an artist
among the goldseekers. When Marius
Dahlgren left San Francisco to seek his
fortune in the Nome gold fit-Ids he took
with him paint and canvas to immortalize
the country in the event of the country
neglecting to Immortalize him financially.
But with Mr. Dahlgren's party a small
boat â or rather its constituent parts â was
taken, and at last when they landed was
put together for use. Then came the
tragic discovery that the dishonestâ or
only careless â shrpbuilder had forgotten
to include the whitelead in the boat's fix
ings, and how to calk the seams without
It at eighty miles distance from Nome
civilization was the question. At last the
Goth of the party suggested the artist's
paintbox, and with tears the sacrifice was
made, the "landscapes of the future"
decorating the insensate seams of the lit
tle craft. It was perhaps owing to this
treatment, however, that the tiny boat
escaped wrecking during a twenty-eight
days' Journey through the recent terrible
storms from. Port Clarence to Nome.
All Purses and Premiums Will Be
Paid in Full â Harness Men
How Headed for San
Jose.
Aided by the elements the brilliant Tan
foran Park Fair came to an inglorious
ending yesterday. Rain helped alleviate
the sufferings of sad-eyed Ed Smith, tue
Sacramento Impresario of racing, Â¦who
inveigled Henry J. Crocker and other
prominent society men into the scheme.
As a promoter. Smith Is not a success,
though he will long live in turf history
as the discoverer of "the invisible foul."
After playing to nine days of vacant
benches in the grand stand the directors
of the San Francisco and San Mateo Ag
ricultural Association met yesterday and
In order to meet a $12,000 dencit it was de
cided to levy an assessment of $4 a share.
Sixty of the most prominent business men
in the city comprise the list of stock
holders, but it Is understood Henry J.
Crocker, president of the association, will
be the chief sufferer. All "premiums and
purses offered at the fair, it is said, wili
be paid in full.
The whole thing was the dream of a
vacant mind; an ill-timed endeavor to
lead the sedate and peaceably inclined
residents of San Mateo County into the
idea that they were ripe ror a season of
sport. The county has already had too
much racing, coupled with its attendant
evils, and society and society folks
frowned on the venture. If its flame was
fanned to injure the State Fair held at
Sacramento its own lights flickered and
went out.
Of course rain precluded any trotting
or pacing yesterday. This was the knot
hole that allowed the cat to get out of
the barn. The rules governing the racing
at Tanforan will not permit of declaring
the meet off. but it will be postponed
from day to day.
Beginning in the early hours to-day th3
prize cattle and horses will be put aboard
the cars, the handsome traps and car
riages will be removed to tne manufac
tories from which they came, the harnes3
horse people will head for San Jose and
another dream will have been proved a
false reality.
Light Receipts and Rain
Cause the Meeting to Be
Declared Off.
TANFORAN RACING
ENDS ABRUPTLY
Leaders Are So Far Ahead That It
Will Be Difficult for Rivals
to Overtake
Them.
BOSTON. Oct. 4.â It now appears to.be
almost a foregone conclusion that Brook
lyn will again win the championship of
the National League. With the close of
the season just nine days off. the leaders
are sufficiently far in advance of their
nearest competitor to reasonably insure
them the pennant. The Brooklyn team
has but six more games to play in order
to finish the schedule, and of this num
ber but two wins will be required to se
cure the championship. On the other
hand, Pittsburg has eight more games to
play, and could not gain first place even
by winning all of them If Brooklyn should
score two mora. victories, so, to say the
least, Brooklyn's chances are very bright.

BAN^JOSE, Oct. -4.â Mrs. A. E. Wilder,
wife of the vice president of the Fan Jose
Safe Deposit Bank, and Mrs. F. M. Gray,
two prominent society ladies, had an ex
perience with a foctpad last night that
they, are not likely to forget. They had
been attending a cor. cert 'at the St. James
Hotel, and shortly after 10 o'clock started
for home. Mrs. ' Wilder resides at 553
Xorth Fourth street and Mrs. Gray in the
vicinity. -
As they passed the warehouses on First
street, near the railroad track, a man
came out of the darkness and followed
them. They paid no attention to him.
Turning Into Empire street from First the
footpad rapidly closed the distance be
tween himself and the ladles. The first
Intimation the ladies had of the man's
Intention was when he grabbed Mrs.
Wllder's purse, which she carried In her
hand. She hung on plucklly to her money
and screamed. Then both ladies screamed
âand screamed again for help. People In
the neighborhood were aroused and some
approaching pedestrians rushed to their
assistance. The highwayman made sev
eral Jerks to obtain possession of the
purse and then turned and fled, getting
out of the way before help arrived.

FOOTPAD ATTACKS TWO
SAN JOSE WOMEN
WITNESSES TESTIFY
IN BEGEROWS FAVOR
Say That He Was Attacked by Cech
and Berger and Fired the Fatal
Shots in Self-Defense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 4.â Some favorable tes
timony was given to-day to substantiate
the plea of self-defense set up by ex-Con
stable Begerow of Alviso. who shot and
killed Joseph Cech and August Berger at
the brewers' picnic on July 15. Begerow
also took the stand and told of the kill
ing, which he claimed he did only in self
defense and after the decedents had
threatened his life.'
The prosecution rested about noon. Their
witnesses have been rather weak, and it
looks as though Begerow will be ac
quitted.
Max Shannanb'erger was the principal
witness the prosecution had on to-day,
and he proved an excellent witness for the
defendant. He saw the, trouble between
the constable and Cech and Berger. He
said Begerow had arrested "Bismarck"
and Cech and Berger took him away from
the officer, whom they struck. Begerow
drew a club, which he lost in the scuffle.
Then he drew a revolver and said some
thing to the men. The constable fired one
shot in the air and then killed the two
men, who were pressing toward him.
Antone Wolff and Mrs. Bloem were
other witnesses. â¢
The defense introduced a number of
witnesses from Alviso to testify to Bege
row's character. They all said it was
good.
Leo Maloney, a 12-year-old boy, gave
the same testimony as Max Shannajiber
ger.
Begerow then took the stand in his own
behalf. Mrs. Begerow occupied a chair
near his attorney and wept while her hus
band told the story of the murders. Bege
row said he went to the picnic and while
there was appealed to to maintain order
by the barkeeper. He said Cech and Ber
ger came up to him and abused him as an
officer. They used vulgar language to him,
and when he arrested "Bismarck" they
took the prisoner away. His story was
practically the same as told by witnesses
Shanranberger and Maloney. Begerow
said they beat him about the face, and he
warned them not to interfere with his
duties as an officer. They threatened to
kill him. He received a black eye and
blows on nose and mouth. His club was
knocked from his hand. To protect him
self he drew a revolver and warned them
to stop. Then they repeated their threat
to kill him. He fired a shot in the air to
warn them, but Cech and Berger came
for him and he killed them. Defendant
made a good impression with the jury.
The clothes Begerow wore at the time
were introduced In evidence. They wera
covered with blood, which ho declared
came from injuries he received at the
hands of Cech and Berger.

TWO FRANCHISES
WILL BE GRANTED
MUCH excitement was created on
Stevenson street . yesterday
afternoon by the report of a
pistol fired by Thomas Fitz
gibbons, an aged man, at a
group of young boys ranging in age from
six to twelve years. The old man said tho
boys were annoying him. The bullet
struck a curbstone and glanced to the
brick wall of a building. It narrowly
missed the objects at which it was fired.
No arrests were made.
Shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon a number of boys congregated on
Stevenson street and commenced t to play.
They made considerable racket, but claim
they did not attempt to annoy any par
ticular person. The boys were suddenly
startled by a shot and a bullet struck
the pavement a few feet away from them.
Looking up they say they beheld Thomas
Fitzgibbons in a window of a building at
275 Stevenson street with a smoking re
volver, in his hand. He put the weapon
quickly away and went on smoking his
pipe. Among the boys who were wit
nesses to the affair were George and Her
bert Jones of 251V4 Stevenson street, Willie
and Joe Smith of 26S Stevenson street and
Henry Williamson of 2S3 Stevenson street.
All are under ten years of age.
Soon a crowd, attracted by the shot,
gathered and an investigation commenced.
Fltzgibbons says the boys have been in
the habit of annoying him and admits
that on several occasions he has poured
water on them, but he denies that he
fired the shot. The lads, however, cling
to their story that they saw the smoking
revolver in his hand.
traveled about the country after robbing
his brother and. finally came to this city,
arriving here about a week ago. After
spending his ill-gotten gains he brooded
over the robbery and decided to surrender
himself to the police.
. He saw Policeman McEntee on Market
street and after following him for some
time mustered up sufficient courage to
speak to him. After Travers had told his
story McEntee took him to Captain Sey
mour's office, where he was subjected to
a rigid cross-examination. Beyond saying
that he had robbed his brother and was
remorseful he was extremely reticent.
After ordering him locked up in the tanks
the head of the detective department sent
a telegram to the Chief of Police of New
York announcing the arrest of Travers
and asking for further particulars about
his crime. Up to a late hour last night
no answer had been received to the tel
egram.
"I robbed my brother of $1000 last July
and as the money is now gone I want to
surrender myself, hoping that I may be
given a chance to atone for my crime."
Thus spoke a tall, well-dressed young
man as he accosted Police Officer McEn
tee at the corner of Fourth and Market
streets yesterday afternoon.
"I tried to negotiate a loan from him,"
continued the stranger, "and when he re
fused I entered his office and stole the
contents of his cash drawer. I am sorry
I did it."
The stranger gave his name as Frank
W. Travers, and claimed that he arrived
here from New York some time ago. His
brother, he says, is D. R. Travers, who
has an office at 41 Park Row, Xew York
City.
According to the story Frank Travers
told to Captain of Detectives Seymour hy

The circumstances of the collision which
occurred at 6 o'clock last Tuesday morn-
Ing between the ferry steamer Berkeley
and the steamship Columbia were investi
gated yesterday by Captains Holies and
Bulger, United States Inspectors of local
and foreign steam vessels.
P. A. Doran, master of the steamship
Columbia, made the 'following written
statement to the inspectors:
"I came along the wharves In the usual
manner, giving them a berth of 300 yards,
and slowed at Vallejo-street wharf; tide
about high water (slack), moderate south
east breeze, weather clear and bay
smooth. When abreast of Jackson-street
wharf the ferry boat Berkeley blowed a
long whistle on leaving the slip at Mar
ket street and immediately after gave
one short blast, Indicating our. course to
starboard. I answered with one whistle
and ordered the helm aport and immedi
ately after hard aport. The Berkeley a
little later seemed to lose her headway,
her stern swinging to port, and I then
rang the Indicator 'full speed astern,' and
in about thirty to forty-live seconds later
the Â¦ Berkeley struck our bow with her
port quarter, tearing away about eight
feet or the hull, two frames and four or
five plates, all above the water line. The
headway of the Columbia was practically
stopped at the time of the collision."
C. H. Blaker, master of i the Berkeley,
gave the following account: - â¢
- "I gave the signal to go to the right,
which was answered by him, but he seem
ed to come right. along,' and struck us on
the after port quarter bow, inflicting dam
age as yet unknown." ... ,.
James McLane, mate of the Berkeley,
testified that the Columbia struck the
ferry boat at richt angles. After the
Berkeley had obtained the right of way
by blowing a whistle first Mate McLane
remarked to the captain that "it was a
mighty close shave." If the Berkeley had
been going at her regular speed she would
have passed clear of the Columbia, he
said.
Other witnesses testified that the Berke
ley aXter whistling gave a slow bell for
fifteen seconds, then a full- speed bell and
then a slow bell again.
The investigation will be resumed at 1
o'clock this afternoon. â¢

WITNESSES TELL
OF BAY COLLISION
This Is plainly an attempt to secure restora
tion to the union by mandamus on the allega
tion that the proceedings against him (Silvas)
were Â¦ lrreeular and illegal. Even though this
allegation was true the defense that he failed
to api>eal to the national organization is good.
His , action In Invoking the aid of the court
before exhausting the remedies within the or
ganization .is premature. The constitution of
the organization provides for an appeal to a
board empowered to Â¦ right any- wrongs that
may be committed by the union. This pro
cedure should have been followed by the peti
tioner. Judgment will be entered for the de
fendant.
JuOge Murasky handed down a decision
yesterday denying R. A. Silvas' petition
for a writ of mandate to compel Paper
hangers' Union Local No. 131 to restore
him to standing in that organization.
Some time ago Sllvaa" was dismissed
from the Paper-hangers' Union on com
plaint of the Musicians' Mutual Protec
tive Association. This organization al
leged that Silvas was a member of the
Pacific Coast Musicians' Union, which, it
was claimed by the Musicians' Mutual
Protective Association, is not in fact a
union organization and is a union only in
name. Silvas was placed on trial before
the Paper-hangers' Union. Ho was found
guilty of the charge preferred by the
Musicians' Association and was dismissed
by the Paper-hangers.
He immediately tiled a petition for a
writ of mandate to compel the union to
reinstate him. In defense the Paper
hangers' Union alleged that If Silvas had
a grievance against the local union he
had a. remedy by appeal to the national
organization. Evidence was taken and

Riverside, fell off Folsom street wharf
Into the bay last night. He was .fished
out and sent to the Harbor Hospital,
where he was pumped out. Eighty-five
dollars In coin and a note lor $1200 were
found In his pockets. Sutherland was
wa P , rlne alon K the wharves while drunk
and losing his balance fell overboard.
Abe Atteil took Joe Hill's measure in
clever fashion. Atteil was stronger and
had a stitfer punch. He was, However,
unable to admisister the coup de grace
to his plucky antagonist. The bout went
the limit and the judges awarded Atteil
the palms of victory.
"Billy" O'Nell and Charles Anderson
were next in the padded riner. Both lads
fought hard and fast for four rounds to a
draw. The fighters were willing to quit
at any stage of the game, but tought on
amid the encouraging shouts â¢ of those
seated at the ringside.
"Billy" Thcmas and "Jim" Ryan, alias
Abie's Brother, hove on the scene and did
some ground and lofty tumbling which
aroused much laughter. Abie's Brother
lacked science, punching power and al
most every requisite that would lit him
for a ring career, and the referee stopped
the farce before the third round was half
over. Thomas was Ryan's superior in
every way.
Jim Reed and John Brown fought a
ludicrous and bloody battle. Brown being
awarded a decision after four rounds were
fought. Ed Devlin sent "Billy" Ast Into
dreamland a half minute after the. gong
sounded the signal for the beginning or
hostilities. D. J. Gilmore and Charles
Taylor knocked each other down in the
first round and in the second. After some
heavy lighting Taylor sent Gilmore to the
lioor, where he remained until after, he
was' cojnted out.
The event of the evening was a four
round bout between Willie Granfleld, alias
"Bert Fisher," and Jack Porter. Gran
field wen In the last round by sending ter
rific punches into Porter's solar plexus.
The battle was waged from gong to gong
and was as clever as has been seen at the
local club. Porter could not get past
Granfield's 'terrible left and succumbed to
the punishment.
The first bout was between Eddy Bry
ant and John Scott. Eddy won the bout
after some hard fighting, but was nearly
sent to dreamland because he shot furtive
glances at the entrance of the club. It
was afterward learned that Eddy expect
ed his mother, and he feared her more
than he did his active anu more heavily
muscled opponent.
Gore flowed In quantity last night at the
San Francisco Athletic Club. Gritty
youngsters battled for trophies before a
crowd which filled every Inch of the
Club's gymnasium. Eight bouts were
presented for the enjoyment of those in
attendance, and of this number three
were knockouts, two were stopped by the
humane referee, one was declared a draw
after the fiercest kind of righting and
two were decided by the judges, Tommy
Kyan and Frank McConnell. Office-seek
ers sparred- for votes, but no decisions
were rendered by the populace. Dr. C. C.
O'Donnell accepted the call to act as ref
eree and did so to the dissatisfaction of
the ilgnt-goers. Julius Kahn and K. Porter
Ashe were chosen judges, but fortunately
for them they were not called upon to ren
der a decision.

Chairman Reed contended that accord
ing to the terms of the charter the fran
chise on First street had not been for-
Commissioner Maguire cf the Board of
Pubiic Works held that the franchise had
lapsed because the road had not been used
and work had not been commenced in
accordance with the charter.
"A new franchise," said Mr. Troy,
"must be granted, subject to charter pro
visions. The Market-street Company uses
the poorest rails arid should be compelled
to use the Berlin rail. The poles should
be procured In this city. Modern appli
ances do not mean trolley wires, which
are the cheapest moans of propulsion."
K. P. K. Troy said that the lUchmond
Improvement Association contended that
the old franchise on First streel had been
forfeited, as the road had not been run
nir.g for two years.
The Suporvir-ors* Public Utilities Com
mittee reported last night in favor of the
linal passage of the ordinances granting
the klarket-Â«treet Company the right to
operate electric roads on First and Fifth
streors. The committee, in response to
improvement club petitions, win make an
ir.fiejHMideri investigation of the feasibil
ity of using the Berlin or flat rail in the
future construction of car lines in this
city. Several representatives of various
improvement clubs. including the
Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs, Public Central Improvement
Club, Richmond District Improve
ment Club and North Central Improve
ment Club, addressed the committee for
and against the proposed franchise.
Henderson asked that the street railway
company be required to have poles made
in rhis citv and alro to use the flat rail.
J. T. Burke, attorney for the company,
that the present running gear of the
car-5 was not suitable for the flat rail and
the v.heels would have to be replaced.
All the material was already purchased
and was now on the grround. Burke snid
that if the beard should insist on an un
derground system the franchise would
have to be abandoned on account of the
great expense.
The Sunnys-ide district will be provided
with six electric lights to-day. President
Crockett of the San Francitco Gas and
Electric Company agreed to put up six
poles at a cort of $000, the city to pay $100
of the expense. G. Schnee. president of
the Sunnyside District Improvement Club,
strongly urged the installation of the
lights. >"-â " ;
McCarthy said be would introduce a
resolution ordering the company to pave
sue;, streets, the list of which will be fur
nished by Henderson.
Supervisor McCarthy drew from Troy
that his club did not oppose the granting
of the franchise, but that it wanted the
corr.par.y to pay 2 per cent of its gross
rocciptf. to the city.
M. Henderson of the Public Central Im
provement Club thought it a good oppor
tunity to insist that the Markef-stroet
company be made to pave the streets on
which it had abandoned tracks.
felted, as the company had In good faith
commenced the exercise of its privilege
within six months after the charter took
effect. He areued that the opposition of
city officials to the work and the reso
lution ordering operations to be stopped
would prevent the forfeiture of the fran
chise.
