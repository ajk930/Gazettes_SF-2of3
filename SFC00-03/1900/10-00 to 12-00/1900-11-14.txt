DR. EDWARD A. ROSS, WHO
RETIRES FROM STANFORD.
(Photograph by Thors.)
Last year I spoke three times In public, once
before university extension center on "The Brit
ish Empire," once before a church on "The
Twentieth Century City," and once before a
mass-meeting on coolie Immigration. To my
utterances on two of these occasions objection
has been made. It Is plain, therefore, that this
is no place for me. I cannot with self-respect
Objectionable Utterances.
My coolie immigration speech is not my sole
offense. Last April I compiled with an invita
tion from the Unitarian church of Oakland to
lecture before them on "The Twentieth Century
City." I addressed myself almost wholly to
questions of city growth and city health and
touched only Incidentally on the matter of pub
lic utilities. I pointed out, however, the drift,
both here and abroad, toward the municipal
ownership of water and gas works, and predict
ed that, aa regards street railways, American
cities would probably pass through a period of
municipal ownership and then revert to private
ownership under regulation. My remarks were
general in character and, of course, I took no
stand en local questions. Only months of spe
cial investigation could enable me to eay
whether a particular city like Oakland or San
Francisco could better Itself by supplying Its
own water or light. Tet this lecture was ob
jected to.
"In doing so I wish to express once more the
high esteem in which your work as a student
and a teacher, as well as your character as a
man, is held by all your colleagues."
"I have waited till now In the hope that clr-
CTimtlaacejjpjEht^ariBe which would lead you
to a reconsideration.
"At this has not been the case, I, therefore,
with great reluctance accept your resignation,
to take effect at your own convenience.
My resignation was not acted upon at once,
and efforts were made by President Jordan and
the president of the board of trustees to induce
Mrs. Stanford to alter her decision. These
proved unavailing, and on Monday, November
12, Dr. Jordan accepted my resignation in the
following terms:
Acceptance of Resignation.
"When I handed In the above Dr. Jordan read
me a letter which he had Just received from
Mrs. Stanford, and -which had, of course/ been
written without knowledge of my resignation.
In this letter she Insisted that my connection
with the university end, and directed that I
be (riven my time from January 1 to the end
of the academic year.
have given me. I am unwilling: to become a
cause of worry to Mrs. Stanford or of embar
rassment to you. I therefor* beg .leave to offer
my resignation as professor of sociology, the
same to take effect at the close of the acade
mic year 1900-01."
Noted Sociologist Resigns His Position Because His
Opinions Conflict With Those of the Patroness
of the Palo Alto University.
STAXFORD UNIVERSITY. Now â¢
13.â Dr. Edward Roes, head pro
fessor in the department of eco
nomics and sociology at Stan
ford University, has tendered his
resignation to President Jordan and will
leave the Institution in a few weeks.
This announcement broke like a. clap of
thunder from a clear sky upon the unsus
pecting students and faculty to-day, for
tnc term of Dr. Ross' professorship is as
old as the university itself and he was
one of the most celebrated and best liked
xr.en on the faculty. The most surprising
part of the affair is that Dr. Ross is
leaving against the wishes of both the
president of the university and the board
of trustees. President Jordan explains
t!ia.t Dr. Ross has resigned for purely
personal reasons, which cannot be made
public at present. Professor Ross, on the
other hand, avows that personal reasons
are not the real ones, as his relations
with both the faculty and the trustees
have been most pleasant and cordial on
both ElÂ£es.
So far as the students are concerneu
they are a ur.it in favor of his retention,
as Dr. Ross is one of the most conpanion
cble as -well as inspiring men on the fac
ulty.
In a statement which Professor Ross
grave out to-day he intimates that he has
been forced out of his position on ac
couct of remarks which he has made as a
ecientiFt and which are in line with his
work aa a. searcher and utterer of the
truth. The statement, which follows,
gives Dr. Ross 1 side of the story quite
fully:
Professor Ross" Statement.
At the berinnln* or last May a representa
tive of Organized Labor asked Dr. Jordan to
bo oce of the speakers at a. mail meeting; called
to protect as-aJnrt coolie lmmisrailon. and to
present "the scholar's Mew." He was unable
to attesfl, but recommended rce as a. substitute.
Accordingly I accepted, and on thcevening of
T read m. twenty -five-minute paper from
th* platform of Metropolitan Hall, in San Fran
cesco. My remark* appeared In part in the San
Franel*Â«> AalHes of May $. and in full on May
IS In a weekly c&ZIed Organized Labor.
I tried to Fbow that owing to its high
MalthuElan birth rate the Orient is the land of
â¢Vheap men," and that the coolie, thoug-h he
ccr.not outdo the American, can underllve him.
I took the ground that the fclph standard of
living: that restraini multiplication in America
arfl] be imperiled If Orientals are allowed to
pour Into tniÂ» country in great numbers before
ther have raised their etand&rd of II Tins and
levered their birth-rate. I arrued that the *
Pacific Is the r.aiursJ frontier of East and .
and that California, might easily ei
prrlenee the tame terrible famines as India and
Chlca If It teemed with the earn* kind of men.
In thus seientincalljr co-ordinating the birth
rate with the Intensity of the struggle for ex
istence I etroclc a new note In the discussion
Â«f Oriental Immigration, Â¦which, to quote one
Of the newspaper*, "made a profound impres
sion."
Displeases Mrs. Stanford.
At Stanford University the professors are
â¢rj>c!nted from year to year, and receive their
reeppointraent early in May. I did not ret
ir.lne then, but thought nothing of It until, on
ilar IS, I>r. Jorfiaa. to'.d me that, quite un
expectedly to him, Mrs. Stanford had nhown
fc*rÂ»elf greatly diepleased with me, and had
refused to reappolnt me. He had heard from
tier Jutt after my address on coolie immigra
t:rn. He had no criticism for me, and was
profoundly distressed at the idea of dismissing
t>. for utterances within the scientist's
own field. He made earnest representations to
Mrs. Stanford, and en June 2 I received my
belated rearpolntment for 1900-01. The outlook
wes Fuch, however, that on June 5 I offered
the following resignation:
"Dear Dr. Jordanâ I was eorry to learn from
yeu a fortnight ago that Mrs. Stanford do^s
Â»("â¢* approve of me as an economist and does
net want me to remain here. It was a pleas
ure, however, to learn at the same time of the
unqualified terms In which you had expressed
to her your high opinion of my work and your
complete confldÂ»nce in me as a teacher, a
eclentlft and a man.
"While I appreciate the steadfast support you
decline to speak on topics to which I have Blven
years of Investigation. It is my duty as an
economist to impart on occasion to sober people
and In a scientific spirit my conclusions on sub
jects with which I am expert. And If I speak
I cannot but take positions which are Justified
by statistics and by the experience of the old
world, such as the municipal ownership of
water works or the monopoly profits of street
car companies/or by standard economic science,
puch as the relation of the standard of life to
the density of population.
I have lens been aware that my every appear
ance in public drew upon me the hostile at
tentlcn of certain powerful persons and inter
ests In San Francisco, and redoubled their ef
forts to be rid of me. But I had no choice but
to go straight ahead. The scientist's business
is to know some thlnsa clear to the bottom.
and if he hides what he knows he loses his
virtue.
I am sorry to go, for I have put too much
of my life Into this university not to love it.
aiy chief rcsret In leaving is that I must break
the ties that bind me to my colleague* of seven
years and must part from my great chief, Dr.
Jordan. I
Dr. Jordan's Statement. !
Speaking of the matter. President Jor
dan said that ho was exceedingly sorry
that Dr. Ros? had taken the action here
recorded. Continuing-, he said:
"I consider Dr. Ross a mun without a
peer in America to-day when it comes to
teaching social science. He is one of
the most virile and inspiring men in the
classroom that I know. The reason of his
resignation is a personal one. There is
absolutely no objection taken eltber to
the man, to what he teaches or the man
ner In which it is taught. The vacancy
he will leave in our faculty cannot be
filled. There are many good economists,
but there are no sociologists of his rank
in the country. At present I cannot say
who his successor will be."
Edward Alsworth Ross is probably the
most noted sociologist in America. He
was born in Iowa thirty-three years ago,
graduating from college at the- age. of
nineteen. The next five years he spent in
study at the University of Berlin and
Johns Hopkins University.- He took his
doctor's degree at the latter institution,
in 1891 at the age of 24. While here he be
came a member of the Phi Beta Kappa
fraternity. He was appointed professor
of economics and social science at Indiana
University by President ' Jordan In 1891,
taking the place left vacant by Professor
Jenks when the latter was called to the
head of his department at Cornell. Next
year Professor Jenks called Dr, Ross^to
tn6'~ assoclate"*""professofship : of political
economy and finance - at -.Cornell. During:
this time Dr.- Ross acted aa secretary of
the American Economical Association.
Professor Bass' Work.
' When Senator Stanford appointed Dr.
Jordan president of his new university he
gave him full power to appoint his as
sistants. The regard which President Jor
dan has for Ross' work is shown by. the
fact that one of the first appointments
he made was that of Professor Ross to be
head of the department of economic
theory and public finance at Stanford Uni
versity. This position he has held ever
since. In 1897 he was advanced to the pro
fessorship of sociology on account of his
brilliant work in that line.
Recently Dr. Ross was elected a mem
ber of the Institut International des So
ciologie, he being one of the seven Amer
icans so honored.
Â¦ In the last nine years Dr. Ross has con
tributed thirty-seven articles to the lead
ing journals of science. That his work is
of the highest order is shown by the fact
that he is a constant contributor to the
Political Science Quarterly, Annals of
American Academy, Quarterly Journal of
Economics, Yale Review, publications of
the American Economic Association,
American Journal of Sociology, Review of
Reviews, Arena. Independent and Out
look. He has already in the hands of the
publisher a book entitled "Social Control,"
which will appear next year in two vol
umes, "t

LONDON. Nov. 13.-Slr Michael
Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, speaking this even
ing in Bristol, said It would not
be his privilege- in the next
budget to relieve the taxpayers. He
wished he could say that he was not able
to increase the budget, but the Govern
ment's expenses had been enormous, es
pecially in China and South Africa. He
declared emphatically, however, that the
wealth of the Transvaal would have to
bear part of the South African expenses.
The early calling of Parliament, with
the object of securing for the Government
further borrowing power to meet the ex
penses of the South African and Chinese
situations, has caused much comment In
the money market. It is understood that
the Government has already borrowed
4^.000.000 from the Bank of England, and
further operations of this kind would be
imprudent and would disorganize the
money market.
It I* quite impo*Bible to foretell what
amount the Chancellor of the Exchequer
trill find it necessary to borrow.

The department recognizes that the Mari

It supported the company's contention
that the controversy, between Nicaragua

a mixed board instead of by a board
composed solely of Nicaraguans. and the

proper reparation be made, not only for
the loss of its concession but for its prop

The President In his annual message
will, it is expected, strongly recommend
the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote

made to obtain immediate action upon

Remains Presbyterian Creed.
With a majority of one vote, and that
the vote of the moderator, tho New York
Presbytery decided that the Westminster
Confession, with its doctrine of predes
tination, was good enough to remain as
the creed of the Presbyterian church.
The number of votes cast was 142, of
which KG were recorded as votes of
clergymen and thirty-three as votes of
elders of the church. The action taken
at the meeting was found in the "over
ture" which had been sent out to all the
Presbyterians of this country by the Gen
eral Assembly of the Prpsbytorian church
for tho purpose of ascertaining the opin
ion of the various bodies of the church on
the question of revising the creed. When
the vote had been counted it was found
that seventy-one favored revision and
sevonty-onp opposed it. The announce
ment thai the vote was a tie created a
*tir among those present. The state<1
clerk. Dr. Birch, drew the attention of
the assembly to the rule governing the
Presbytery, which provides that in ca- c e
of a tie the moderator shall cast the de
ciding vote. Dr. Wiley had already voted
In his Individual rapacity and 'his vote
had been recorded as against revision.
The moderator then cast his vote with

stories and the hero of many a New York
melodrama. He was known as "Jimmy"
Corcoran and gained most of his fame as
the founder and ruler for half a. century

his fame with his class rested upon, tho
fact that he hated policemen, one of
whom he maimed for life, "just for exer

New York more than half a century ago

EDINBURGH, Nov. 13.-Joseph H.
Choate. United States Embassador to
Great. Britain, this evening delivered tho
Inaugural lecture at the Philosophical In
stitution of Edinburgh, taking as his
theme "The Career and Character of Ab
raham Lincoln:" ,"* 7"
Lord Rosebery, who presided, introduced
Mr. Choate as follows:
"Mr. Choate is one of that choice suc
cession of men whom the United States
have sent to this country. HÂ» has en
deared himself to us In a remarkable de
gree by his. brilliant and genial qualities.
For his discourse, he. has selected one. of
the most Interesting subjects in the range
of possibility, the great man whom ne
personally knew in the flesh, Abraham
Lincoln."
Mr. Choate said in part:
"When you asked mo to deliver the in
augrural address on this occasion, I recog
nized that 1 owed this compliment to tne
ract that 1 was the atf}clal representative
of Americaâ and in selecting a subject I
ventured to think that'l might interest
you for an hour In a brief stuUy in popu
lar government, as illustrated oy the life
or tne most American of all Americans. 1
therefore offer no apology for asking your
attention to Abraham Llneoln-to his
.unique character and the parts hjj bore in
two important achievements 01 .modern
historyâ the preservation of the integrity
01 the American union and the emancipa
tion of the colored race.
"During his brief term of power he was
probably the object of more abuse vllli
ncatlon and ridicule than any other man
In the world; but when he fell by tne hand
ot an assassin at the very moment Of his
stupendous victory, aJl the nations of tho
earth vied with one another in paying
homage to his character, and the thirty
tive years that have since elapsed have
established his place in history as one of
the great btnetoptors, not 01, nis own
country alone, biit of the human race.
â¢.Fiction can turnish no match for the
romance of his life, and biography will be
searched in vain for such startling vicis
situdes of fortune, for great power and
glory won out of such humble beginnings
and adverse circumstances."
â¢Mr. Choate then entered upon a rather
detailed story of the early trials and pri
vations of Abraham Lincoln, his strug
gles in the study and practice of law. Said
he;
"My professional brethren will naturally
ask me, how could this rough backwoods
man, whose, youth had been spent in the
forest or on ihe farm and fiatboat without
culture and training-, education or studv.
by the random reading, on the wing, of "a
few miscellaneous law books, become a
learned and accomplished lawyer? Well,
ne never did. He never would have earned
his salt as a writer for the Signet, nor
. y Â£ won a P lac Â« as advocate in the Court
of besolons. where the technique of the
profession has reached its highest per
fection and centuries of laming and prece
dent are involvd in the equipment of a
lawyer. Dr. Holmes, when asked by an
anxious young mother, 'when should the
education of a child begin?' replied.
Madam, at least two centuries before it
is born, and so I am sure it is with the
bcots lawyer.
i R Vn But Ot 1 Â« > a ln . IllinoIs in 1M0- Between
1S30 and 1SS0 Its population Increased

soon foundtheir favorites among the ad
vocates. The fundamental principles of
the common law as set forth by Black
stone and- Chltty were not so difficult to
acquire; and brains, common sense, force
of character, tenacity of purpose, ready
wit and powntÂ» of speech did the rest and
supplied all the deficiencies of learning "

? J"Â°r d , R Â°sPbery. replying to a vote of
thanks for presiding, said:
"Lincoln was one of the great figures of
the nineteenth century. To me it has also
seemed that he was the second founder
of the great republic. His strength rested

LIFE OF LINCOLN
FOR HIS THEME
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â To-day's Cab
inet meeting stands as one of the most
rf-markablf sessions of that body. Presi
dent McKinley announced clearly and
forcefully to the members of his Cabinet
his desire that they should all remain
with Jiim curing: the four years of his
comtes administration. His wishes were
:nade knuwn in an extended speech at the
<?.1'inPt mooting in the White House to
rts y. Rrsunnses were made by all of the
members present. While there were no
â¢ Uiinite f'eiipes from any of them that
th<*y would accept the portfolios ihus ten
detvd afresh there was. on the other
hand, no definite declination.
To-dayf proceedings set forth the
wishes of the President in the matter and
relieve the members of the Cabinet of the
< ustom&ry obligation of tendering their
resignation* at the ond of the term, un-
Ipss they have made an Irrevocable deci
sion that it vi ill he impossible for them to
continue in office. It also sets at rest
speculation and slatemaktng of the coun
try's political prophets, for it is under
stood generally that there is but one
Â¦doubtful factor in the homogeneity of the
Itresem Cabinet. That factor is Attorney
general Griggs. as he holds his present
place at .1 eroat financial sacrifice. Still
Mr. Gripps replied in terms of warm ap
preciation to the eomplimentOT-v remarks
or the President and voiced no Intention
t>f retiring from his present position.
This is nÂ«n the first time that the Presi
dent has expressed to the members of the
Cabinet hit. pl^aeure at the support thev
had piver. him. He said as much in a
general way at the last Cabinet meeting,
whrn the mrmhers. several of whom had
been toattered by the political campaign,
icot together for the ,.rst time and con
*ratuiatf><l him upon the outcome of the
election. To-day the President evidently
had prepared for the occasion, and in his
address reviewed the work of the admin
istration in the last four years. He said
thnt jf the result of the recent election
Â¦was an Indorsement of his administration
it v.a? no Ires an indorsement of the men
who had stood by him in the time of
stress and adversity. The credit for suc
cess. hÂ« paid, lay with the heads of h.s
various departments, and he should
shrink from upon another four
years of office unless he could be assurred
that he would have with htm a majority
Â«t l*>af*t of th<^ men who form his present
official household. He said he knew that
in askinc them to remain with him there
was scarcely one who cotild do so with
out some sacrifice either of money, leisure
or personal Inclination. At the same timÂ«Â»
he paid he should feel happier if all of
them could pratify his wishes.
Secretary Hay was the first to respond.
He paid that for hi? part he deeply ap
preciated the complimentary references
made by his chief, and that he thought
Â¦there was net a member of the Cabinet
who would sever such pleasant official re
lat.i ft ns without regret, and even then only'
in case Â«f the most urgent reasons for
retirement.
Secr^tari*?!* GaÂ«re. I>ong. Hitchcock. Wil
son. Attorney General Gripgs and Post
master General Smith each spoke in turn
and in much the same vein. Secretary
Root was the only absent member from
the meetinp havinc left for Cuba to look
over military affairs there and. at the

long and serious i!lno*>e. TlÂ»e list of re

UNION CONVENTION
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â A. W. Vaille,
director general of posts of the Philip
pine Islands, in his annual report to the
Postmaster General shows a surplus of
$19,628 to the credit of the Philippine pos
tal service. The revenue to June 30 last
was $117,848 and the expenditures' $9S,22<;,
making both years of the department's
existence show a surplus. Decided prog
ress has been made in opening postofflces.
It has been the endeavor to have an of
fice in charge of an American clerk wher
ever the number of troops made It im
practicable for tho army mail orderlies to
do the work. Mr. Vaille says the corre
spondence between the natives on the isl
ands Is "as near nil as that of ranchers
at our army posts in the States." There
are now twenty-one postofflces under the
charge of Americans, of which eleven are
money-order offices. Thirty-seven other
offices are in charge of army officials for
the sale of stamps and tho handling of
registered matter. The system of mili
tary postofflces has worked satisfactorily,
the revenues from such sources amount
ing to $1175. without any offsetting ex
pense. In several provinces in which na
tive governments have been established a
revival of the Bystem. of service main
tained under the Spanish regime for the
native malls only has been tried. Each
town presidents had' to attend to the mall
for and from his town free, and each
town provides regular carriers to adjoin

what correspond.^ to our road tax. It

provinces that the revenues of the mails
of natives would not be of much help in
maintaining a paid service. Each town la

A LAW UNTO HIMSELF.
Every Man Must Be That, to Betain
Sis Health, and Digestion.
There are thousands of people In this
world would eat no meat from one year's
end to another, and certain savage tribes
in Africa and Polynesia are almost ex-
clusively meat eaters: but while there arÂ«
thousands of these, there are millions who
live upon a mixed diet of meat, vegetables
and grains, and if numbers is a criterion,
it would seem that a mixed diet is tho
best for the human family.
The fact that you will find many vege-
tarians who appear healthy and vigorous
and meat eaters equally so. and any num-
ber of robust specimens who eat both,
meat and vegetables and anything el?a
that comes their way all goea to ghow
that the old saw is the true one, thaL
every man must be a law to himself as
to what he shall eat and drink.
To repair the waste of tissue In brain
workers as well as to replace tha musclo
and sinew of the laborer, can only be don*
through the process of digestion.
Kvery nerve, muscle, sinew, every drop
of blood, is extracted from the food we
tat and digest.
In these days of hustlÂ© and worry, and
artificial habits of life, scarcely one per-
son in a thousand can lay claim to a per-
fest digestion: dyspepsia is a national af-
fliction and Stuart s Dyspepsia Tablets a
national blessing.
Most cases of poor digestion are cau.se<i
by failure of the stomach to secrete suf-
ficient gastric juice, or too little hydro-
chloric acid and lack of peptones, and all
of these Important essentials to perfect
digestion are found in Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets in convenient palatable form.
One or two of these tablets taken after
meals Insure perfect digestion and assim-
ilation of the food.
Cathartic pills and laxative medicines
have no effect whatever in digesting food
and to call such remedies a cure for
dyspepsia Is far fetched and absurd.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain pep-
sin tree from animal matter, diastase and
other digestives, and not only digest all
wholesome food, but tend to Increase thf*
flew of sastric Juices and by giving tho
weak stomach a much needed rest bring
about a healthy condition of the digestive
organs and a normal appetite.
Nervous, thin-blooded, run-down people
should bear In mind that drues and stim-
ulants cannot furnish good blood, strong
muscle and steady nerves: these como
only from wholesome food, thoroughly
digested. A fifty-cent box of Stuart's
Tablets taken after meals for a few-
weeks will do you more real good than
drugs, stimulants and dieting 1 combined
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is probably
the safest, most popular and successful
digestive on the market, and sold bv druc-
eists everywhere In the United "States
Canada and Great Britain.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 13.â "Suppose a
candidate's friends should hire every hack
in town and use them on election day in
his interest, would that vitiate his elec
tion?"
This was the question which Justice Mc-
Farland propounded late thfs afternoon
from the Supreme bench. Attorney A. L.
Shinn answered that if done with tne can
diaatâ¬Â£s consent it certaliily should vitiate
his election, but the Justice was not quite
satisfied.
"Then a man would have no right to
obtain the assistance of his friends at
the polls," said the Supremo Justice.
Attorney Shlnn said that he woulo" have
no right to permit anything to be done
for him that would be contrary to the
spirit of the purity of elections law.
Tv.-o cases cf great interest, not only to
the people of Sacramento but to office
holders and the public throughout the
State, were up for argument before the
Supreme Court this afternoon. When
George H. Clark assumed the office of
Mayor of Sacramento last January he
found himse'.t defendant in two lawsuits,
one having been brought by nls predeces
sor, William Land, in which he claimed
the right to continue in the office of
Mayor on the ground that Clark had not
filed his election expense account within
the time prescribed by law. The other
suit had been Instituted by William H.
Bradlev, a hackman, who alleged that
Clirk had caused to be expended in his
campaign more than he was allowed to
spend under the purity of elections law,
and that therefore his office should be de
clared vacant. Both suits were vigorously
fought in the Superior Court of Sacra
mento County and in both the judgments
were in Clark's favor. Appeals from
theÂ£e judgments were taken by Land and
Bradley and a dozen lawyers were on
hand in the Supreme Court chamber this
afternoon to engage In the presentation
of -the case from the standpoints of the
appellants and the respondent.
Clark's attorneys maintained. In the
matter of the Land appeal, that the cer
tificate of election given to Clark was
prima facie evidence of his claim to the
office and that the Allegations made by
Land's attorneys that the candidate's ex
pense account had not been filed prior to
the issuance of the certificate of election
and that It was not a proper account, did
not stand In the presence of the prlma
fncie claim embodied In the certificate.
This case was taken under advisement by
the court.
Next there was called tho appeal - of

Cowardly Crime Followed by
Attempted Suicide of
Assassin.
Special EHspatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 13.â William
Ashley, a young man about 23 years of
age, working for his aunt, Mrs. .Connell,
at her nursery on the Esquimau road, was
last evening shot and killed by Thomas
Connell, his aunt's divorced husband.
Connell, who was jealous of the young
man, went to the greenhouse evidently
with the Intention of murdering his for
mer wife, as well as the nephew, but
cowardice prevented the commission of a
double crime. He found Ashley leaning
down in the greenhouse attending his
fires, and. calling him, shot him as he
turned. Mrs. Connell, who v was in the
house, heard the shot and rushed out to
tho street to a passing car, which stopped
as the crew heard her cries. The murder
er, after killing the young man, went to
the house, and a little girl, who was en
gaged to do the housework, met him and
told him that Mrs. Connell had gone out.
Connell wont to the gate and there, meet
ing his late wife ana the crew of the car
coming in, ho took to his heels, crying as
"I told you I'd do It, and_I've done It."
Ashley was found by the girl dying In
the greenhouse. The bullet, which was of
small caliber, had struck him in the right
breast, piercing his lung. He expired soon
afterward. .
The police were notified and an all-night
search was kept up for the escaped mur
derer. He was found this morning hiding
behind a haystack not far from the scene
of the crime by Provincial Constable Hos
klns. The officer ran toward him and as
he did Connell tired at him, the bullet go
ing wide. Connell then ttred two shots at
himself, wounding himself In the head.
He was taken to the hospital and is ex
pected to recover.
Connell bears a bad reputation in the
vlcinitv. He squandered the earnings of
his wife's nursery until she finally was
forced to get a divorce. Young Ashley as
sisted her In the conduct of the business
and In so doing Incurred the hatred of
Connell.
Bradley in the case alleging the Improper
use of money to secure Clark's election^
A. L. Shinn, attorney for Bradley, laid
much stress on what he claimed was the
undisputed testimony at the trial that a
great number of hacks were used in
Clark's Interest on election day and that
banners wero stretched across the streets
announcing his candidacy. although
neither the hacks nor the banners were
mentioned in his expense account. The
attorney declared that these expenses
were. defrayed by Clark's business part
ner; that they were far In excess or the
sum allowed by law, and that they con-
Rtituted a bar to the retention of the of
fice of Mayor by Clark. He claimed in
answer to questions by Justice McFar
land and Garoutte that only by a candi
date specifically denying that such meas
ures wero taken without his knowledge or
consent could be avoided the penalty of
forfeiture of office. He declared, how
ever, that these expenses were incurred
with Clark's knowledge and consent.
Court adjourned at a late hour until to
â¢morrow, when Hiram XV. Johnson will
present arguments on Clark's side. *
This is the first time that the purity of
elections law has ever been brought
squarely before the Supreme Court in this
State, and the decision is awaited with
intense Interest.

known that he was receiver over his own
property, or at least that he might get no
fees, and McKenzle destroyed the deed re
had. And then, just the day before ha
sailed, Qhipps deeded the claim to Charles
Johnson of the Pioneer Mining Company,
receiving in exchange $5000 and an agree
ment 10 protect him in case McKenzle
prosecuted him. Geary wanted to know
if Chipps had returned all the money he
had from time to time received from Mc-
Kenzle for the property he deeded away
to Johnson at the last moment, but thu
Witness said he did not think he owed
anything to McKenzie and anyway Mc-
Kinzie had not fultllled his contract.
After the Chicago agreement was entered
into it was shown that Chipps suggested
that things could be made riyht for $5000,
but McKenzie would not put up.
It was then that Chipps digressed to toll
of the remarks of Bortsemus, and how
he was going to make money anyway ha
could. Bortsenlus said the friends who
would protect him were Kettleson, tho
Pioneer Mining Company and the Lrfine
people. He was Senator Spooner's ap
pointment. _ ,
In the matter of the Reeco affidavit
Chipps said Reece told him on tho way
down ot a conspiracy to trap Knight. Ha
told Keece in Seattle that Knight had n.
warrant out for his arrest, but he would
not admit thnt It was to compel Recce
to make another affidavit corroborating
the 'first. The affidavit referred to a
transaction In which It was charge-1
Noyes received $2000. Nor would Chipps
admit that Knight was offering $2000 if
Iteece would corroborate his first atHdavlt.
Under redirect examination Chipps said
the whole work of the Alaska Gold Min
ing Company was the working of tho
claims which had been turntd over ( ;o Mc-
Kenzie as receiver. These included all the
valuable properties in the district an<l
McKenzie had nearly three hundred mtn
working for him. Chipps said he knew
beforehand that McKenzie would be ap
pointed receiver because McKenzie hod
said so and had added that he could "de
pend on the Judge." McKenzie had
prophesied the granting of the injunction,
too, and it seemed as if he could get about
what he wanted from the court. In fact
it was the belief of Chipps and his lrlends
all along that their strength lay In the
cordial relations existing between McKen
zie and the court.
"You had no confidence in your title to
the claim then?" asked Pillsbury, con
tinuing this point.
"Yes I had," said Chipps.
"You knew that the first locators were
naturalized?"
"Yes. I knew two of them were."
"And why did you sell out for $5000 if
you thought your .title was good?"
"Well. I. thought I could not win, and
even if I did I would not get anything."
"Why not?" â¢
"Because McKenzle would beat me
to it."
"When you found the property could not
be worked by a receiver you thought thj
game was up?"
"Yes, I bt-lteve I did."
"Didn't" you depend on the courts and
the receiver to get you the dust and the
property."
"Yes. I think I did."
"Then the value of the claim to you
was in keeping it in possession of the re
ceiver and retaining the friendship of the
court?"
"Yes, I believe It was."
It was In those words that Chipps con
fessed the infamy of the company of
which he was a director. They had the
receiver; they, had the court: they had
the court reporter and perhaps the clerk:
they had the District Attorney; they had
the best claims tied up; they had jumpers
and plaintiffs to spare; they had, plenty
o% money and influence behind them and
they had the best lawyers in Nome. It
was no wonder Chipps and the company
thought they had "a shade the best of it."
In conclusion Chipps said that all the
suits were handled In the same way; they
wero controlled by McKenzie and his
friends. He also brought out the Inter
esting fact that, the soldiers, so roundly
denounced by Geary yesterday for favor
ing the "Swedes," had been called upon
by Dubois to enforce the order of the
court and that they put McKenzie in pos
session of the Discovery claim as receiver.

TO DISPOSSESS THE MINERS AT NOME AND SECURE THEIR
CLAIMS.
SAN PIEGO. Nov. 13.â The United Stat-,'3
survey steamer Ransrer Â«atl*d from tlili port
thU moraine on a seven months' cruise to La
Paz and the Gull of California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13.â A telegram
reached Santa Fe headquarters In this
city from Chicago shortly after 10 o'clock
this morning calling out all the keyboard
men on the Santa Fe Pacific, the Southern
California and the San Francisco and San
Joaquin VaJley railways. <^3uch of tho
operators as are members of the brother
hood made preparations to obey the In
structions from the head of the order, who
acted on the recommendation of the griev
ance committee, which has for several
days been In close consultaiton with Presi
dent E. P. Rlpley, General Manager XV. G.
Nevin and otners of the leading Santa Fe
officials In Chicago. Then a second teie
gram was clicked off In the railroad of
fices countermanding the first and In
structing the men to remain at their keys.
The intervening time between the receipt
of the two telegrams was the most Inter
esting spent by those most affected in a
good many days, and the sigh of relief
that went up when the second wire
reached Los Angeles was genuine.
Nothing definite Is known In this city
as to the causes that led up to the threat
ened strike.
A Santa Fe strike just at this time
would have been a most t>eriou3 affair.
The Southwestern lines in and out of
Chicago have not been In years so busy
as they are at present. The citrus fruit
shipping season Is In full blast, and idle
telegraphers would be hard to get to fill
the places of the striking men.
Tho report that the Santa Fe's telegraph
operators would go on a strike yesterday
morning occasioned considerable uneasi
ness for a time in the local offices of the
company. Manager Alberger wired early
in the day for particulars, as the first he
Says the Company "Had the Judge,' Receiver and District
\ Attorney and It Looked Like Plain Sailing.
ITHOJJGHT we had a shade the best
of-it," was the way Robert Chipps
summed up the situation for the ;
benefit of all concerned yesterday.
He was telling how he was on his
way to Nome on the steamer Senator
with Noyes and McKenzle, and Wheeler,
the court reporter, and Bqrtsenlus, the
court clerk, and a few others connected
with the court and with the claims, and
all bound to Nome to make money. Noyes
had told him the way to settle all oppo
sition was to have a receiver appointed.
"That would fix them," was the Judge's
comment. Bortsenlus had told him that
he was going up to Nome to make money,
he didn't care how; and If he got into any
trouble there were good friends up there
who would help him out. McKenzie even
then was speculating on receiverships and
whether or not he could be made receiver
over his own property, and the whole par
ty' was looking eagerly forward to the
time when they should land In Nome and
begin operations. They were sure they
had the best of it.
From the time Chipps met McKenzle
and Carter and Hansbrough and Hubbard
In Washington last March it was expect
ed that there would be litigation over the
Discovery claim. For that reason Mc-
Kenzie said they should have a "good
Judge." McKenzie was supporting Noyes.
And then after all had/been settled and
the party was on its/vay to Nome, Mc-
Kenzie and Chipps discussed the best way
to get popsesslon of the claims, and they
decided that the receivership plan would
be better than any other. McKenzle ex
pected to get the receivership, and said so.
In this connction Pillsbury asked on the
redirect examination: ,
"You knew pretty nearly all the valua
ble properties :n that vicinity?"
"Yes I did," was the answer.
"And' it was the programme to get pos
session of them?"
"Yes. sir."
"And you did get possession of them,
didn't you?"
"Yes. sir."
"And isn't it a fact that McKenzle was
appointed receiver of all of these valuable
properties?"
"Yes. sir."
After telling this Chlpps-went on to ad
mit that there were men working on Dis
covery claim when he jumped it; that he
i jumped the claim because he thought one
of the partners was an alien, and In de
fiance of the fact that under the miners'
I rules the discoverer of a paying creek is
entitled to his first location under any cir
cumstances. Chipps also said that it was
advanced that the defendants were hold
ing more than one claim on the creek, but
he admitted that if they lost any under
the rule that forbids the holding of more
than one they would at least not lose the
first claim located, the Discovery. Yet it
was the Discovery that Chipps jumped.
He explained this when he said that it
was yielding $10,000 or $15,000 a day.
Chipps also took a slap at Sam Knight
j when he said Reece had told him on the
I way down from Nome that he had made
j an affidavit for Knight for which Knight
I had paid $7oO, and that the affidavit was
false and a trap to get Knight into trou
j ble.
The examination of the witness has
I strayed far from the Dubols contempt,
! and the attorneys skip from Nome to
Washington and then to Seattle with an
alacrity that promises to furnish a dis
jointed record; but in the meantime there
' is not much of the case that is not going
! in. Yesterday morning Chipps started out
; with his meeting with Hansbrough in
; Washington, when Hansbrough was work
j ing for certain amendments to the Alas
: kan code. Then he was brought up to
Nome to tell that he did not know of the
granting of the injunction against the de
iendants restraining them from taking
their g-old out of the country until he
heard -the injunction had been granted.
He said he had sworn to the affidavit .upon
which the injunction had been based, and
in that affidavit he swore that he was the
owner of the land. He had sworn that he
deeded the land before that lirst to Mc-
Kenzle and then to Hubbard, and when
Geary asked him if he had sworn to a
falsehood when he signed the affidavit, it
looked bad. But it looked worse when
Pillsbury brought out on the redirect ex
| amination that the affidavit had been dic-
I tated to him by Dubois, and it was on
] the advice of Hvbbard. Beeman and Hume
that he signed and filed it. They said
nothing about it being irregular.
Then the subject of the various deeds
to the Discovery claim was taken up. Tho
lirst deed Chipps made was to McKenzia
in Washington. Then he came to Chicago
and made an agreement to deed the claim
to a syndicate there, for he said he did
not know that McKenzie would carry out
his end of the contract. Then when he
went to Nome he deeded the claim to
Hubbard on the advice of McKenzie, who
said he might get into trouble if it were

PLACERVILLE, Nov. 13.â A halt in the
official count of this county occurred last
e%-ening when no tally sheet was found in
the package supposed to contain the elec
tion returns from Grizzly Flat Precinct.
An effort was made before the Board of
Supervisors, supported by the advice of
the District Attorney, to have the package
containing the ballots voted In that pre
cinct opened to ascertain If it did not con
tain the election returns. The County
Clerk refused to break the seal of the
package, as the law compels him to keep
it unopened find unaltered for one year.
The board adjourned then and again to
day, without proceeding further with the
count.
Should the count be eventually com
pleted without the Grizzly Flat returns, It
will break the probable tie between Lard
ned (Republican) and Tabor < Democrat)
for Stale Senator in favor of the latter,
and defeat Hoyt, a Republican candidate
for Supervisor.

Briggs cf Santa Cruz, an lS-year-old son
of a prominent family there, cut a wide
Bwath among the habitues of the tender
loin of this city from Sunday night to

but the presence of Detective Rolls of the

depart for San Francisco this morning.
Leslie left home on Sunday evening. Be

the family chest. Nothing was too good
for young Brings here, and when his few
dollars In money gave out he pawned
the jewelry. He made his headquarters
at the Hotel St. James. Most of his time
was spent in the tenaerloin district and
he cast his jewels about with the lavish
hand of a. prince. A three-carat diamond
ring be gave to a bellboy at the hotel for
a loan of $10. The proprietor of a saloon
was handed a big pigeon-blood ruby ring
ior the use of $15, and an elegant diamond
sunburst went as security for $7. A large
pearl ring was disposed of for J10. The
value of these jewels is said to be SlOQi.
The rest of the gems young Briggs is said
to have with him.
As soon as the young man was missed
from the family home a search showed he
had loaded himself down with jewels. The
police of this city were notified to be on
the lookout for iv.m, and Detective Rolls

HOUNDS CHASE HARES
UNDER A TORRID SUN
Weather Comditfloinis UepropitioiaS for
tlhe Opemflirag of the Interstate
Comrsfling Meet at Modesto.
MODESTO, Nov. 13j-Under, a blazing:
sun and on parched plains eight -miles
south of Modesto the Interstate Coursing
Association, began. to-day its sixth annual
open plains meeting., A scarcity of hares
and" a superheated atmosphere were the
features of- tho open! rip day, which was
too short to permit of the complete run
ning of the first round. Altogether twenty
eight courses were settled, leaving four
teen in the run-down fpr^to-morrow.
This open plains meeting resembles that
of .'last' 'year only. In -a isinple instance â
scarcity of hares.- On* the opening day of
the preceding: meet tho rain fell in sheets.
To-day the sun created an equal amount
of- discomfort, though in an antithetical
way. The hares were strong and fastâ too
much so for the hounds, .as they tore over
the burning sands r almost to exhaustion.
Iowa Maid was the worst sufferer. In the
first course of the" day she defeated La
liosa Souvenir_by the score of 26â0. and
this glory was almost her death sentence.
At a late hour this evening the hound is
in a precarious condition.
Owing to the non-completion of the first
round it^s difficult. to settle upon any one
or two dogs for stake honors. All the
Merced dogs running in T. J. Mclnerney's
name gave good performances to-day.
Last year's stake winner, O. K. Capitol,
is in the running, and several others
ehowed up in good form. The betting was
light, though the attendance was greater
than the average. A few short ends took
the money. Miss Penman at 1 to 4 beat
The Graf terr'Forget finished Cash at 1 to 2
and Mike Fenton, at the same odds with
May Lawrence, took the flag. Bowery
Hoy fell to Lady Granard on the short end
of a 2'to 5, shot. <-
Rusty Gold and Silent Treasure were
withdrawn from the stake for good rea
sons. Game old Rusty Gold received such
a severe-chewing from one of his kennel
mates on Monday night that it is doubtful
if he will ever run again. Silent Treasure,
J. Mooney's dog. tore away from his
* mooring* In the baggnge car on Monday
night twenty miles below Modesto and es
caped. This gave Betsy Barrow and Rob
ert-Emmet a chance for a double bye.

CHICAGO, Nov. 13.â The home of Orrin
â¢W; Potter at 130 Lake Shore drive was
entered by a masked burglar early to
day. Mrs. Potter was awakened as tha
burglar, with a cloth saturated -with
chloroform, was bendfhp over her. She
screamed for help, but before the other
members of the household, arous^i b>*
her cries, could come to her assistance
the burjjlar struck her with a paJr" of
brass knuckles, almost rendering her un
conscious, and escaped. The blotv cut a
deep gash In Mrs. Potter's head and for a
time it was feared that this and the nerv
ous shock would result seriously, but to
day she waa reported to ba resting com
fortably.
Last April the Potter residence was en

WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â It is ihe un
derstanding anvmg prominent South
American members of the diplomatic
corps that the visit of President Campos-
Salles of Brazil to the President of Ar
gentina has been productive of an uii
demandirig by which thcÂ«e two republics
cr the south arc likely ro exert their
united influence toward the paoitjc ad
justment of some of ;ho perplexing ques
tions which have disturbed their heigh
b< ring republics. While tivre is said to
have been do formal truly or alliance
the indications are that the two nations
Tvill now carry forward the same general
policy for a pacinc adjustment of pending
difficu'itice.
One of the concerns is the coast line at
Bolivia. At one time Bolivia, was pos
eeÂ«sed of a. considerable ocean front, with
pcrr.e good harbors. Hut as a result of
warfare Chile took possession of all of
Bolivia's coast line, (caring that country
in much the same condition as Switzer
land, without access to tlie sea and
hemmed in <.n all sides by opposing force.*.
Bolivia has taken this very much to heart
and her jileas have appealed to the sense
of justice of quhe a number of the Soulh
American States;, it j s believed that lio
livia'e plisbt liaf bÂ»-erÂ» taken into consid
eration in conversations between the
President* of J'Â»razil and Argentina, and
lhat. without any recourse to arbitrary
means, they will tiy to induce Chile ii>
srant iJolivia a restoration of at least
t-ome part oi Â«iÂ«-r coast llnÂ«=>. thus restoring
her former dignity and importance as a
maritime nation. Owing to the strong
bonds between these two nations ami
Chile, it is felt that Chile will be disposed
to grant every just desire for tho reha
LIMtation of Bolivia. Beyond . this, how
ever, thore is said to be no likelihood of
any pressure Ix-ing brought to bear on
Chile, as it is only through pacific means
and tho usual . exercise of good offices
that the change Is hoped to be brought
about.
Th<- Argentine Minister, Dr. Edouaide
Wilde, was a: ; krd to-day as to the .-epor's
of political i-ignincance attaching to Presi
dent Campos-Salles' visit to Argentina.
The Minister answered that he Had re
ceived no official advices, but he felt war
ranted in e-X}ire?s!ng his personal convic
tion that the visit would have a very good
lesuk in uniting more lirmly the nuse
political relations. The visit was largeiy
social and complimentary, being a return
of the trip made by the President of A -
gentina to Brazil last year. lJoubtlc.Â«s
there had be+-n an opportunity during ihe
exchange of felicitations to talk over
those subjects on which Brazil and Ar
gentina are mutually interested. Dr.
Wilde ?ays both of the countries desire
an end to the petty complications which
have arisen from time to time in neigh
boring countries so that there may be un
interrupted peace for the development of
their -Fpl<?ndid natural resources. As to
Bolivia^ Dr. Wilde said he was not ad
visod, out thought it quite likelv that
r.r.-jzil and Argentina would make known
their desire for an adjustment of the long
pending source of conflict.
The report which has gained circulation
that the southern countries might form
a commercial alliance antagonistic to th3
I'nlte-d States Is dif=mÂ»sped by -Dr. Wilde
as entirely without foundation. He says
there is in oflielal circles throughout South
America the very highest regard tor ths
preat republic of the north and that com
merce v.-ith this country Â»s belnjf con
stantly fostered. There is iio disposition
â¢inj-where to Interrupt this favorable con
dition, but a constant desire to increase
the trade relations and the strong po
litical bonds of friendship existing be
tween N'orth and South America.

Brazil's President to

BOLIVIA'S PLEA
MAY BE HEARD
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.-S. I. Kimball,
general superintendent of the Life Savins
Sefvice. in his annual report to Secretary
Gage says that at the close of the fiscai
year the establishment embraced 203 sta
tions. 194 being on the Atlantic, 58 on the
lakes. 16 on the Pacific and one at the
falls of the Ohio at Louisville. Ky.
The number of disasters to documented
vessels within the field of operations of
the service during the year was 364. There
were on board these vessels 2C5 persons,
of whom 2Gd~ w.ere saved and forty-eight
lost. Six hundred and seventy-three ship-
KTecked persons received succor at the
stations, to whom 1447 days' relief m the
asgregate was afforded. The estimated
value of the vessels involved in disaster
was $5.127 .SO0. and of their cargoes $3,422,
â¬:*). making a total value of property im
periled of S9.470.1M. Of this amount $7,
234.CW was saved and $2,230,500 lost. The
number of vessels totally lost was sixty
one.
In addition to the foregoing there were
during the year 320 casualties to smull
craft, such as small yachts, sailboat.*,
rowboats. etc., on board of which woic
781 persons, of whom live were losi. The
property involved In these instances id
estimated at $267,070, of which $256,770 was
paved and $10,300 lost.
Besides the number of persons saved
from vessels of all kinds there were b'J3
other? rescued, who had fallen from
wharves, piers and other positions of ex
treme peril, many of whom would have
perished but for the aid of the life saving
crews. Five hundred and fourteen oi'
these were rescued from .dwelling houses,
outbuildings and other elevated placed
submerged wholly or In part by the ter
rible: flood of the Brazos River in Texas.
July 6 to 12, im.
The crews savd and assisted to save
during the year 371 .vessels valued, with
their cargoes, at J4.006.n90, and rendered
assistance of minor importance to 6S3
othtr vessels in distress, besides warning
from danger 194 vessels.
The investigations made into the details
of every shipwreck involving loss of life
and Into the conduct of the life savin,?
crews show that no life was lost through
lack of prompt and faithful efforts on the
part <>f the life saving men. More than
one-half of those who perished were lo.st
by reason of their unwise attempts to
reach the shore in their own boats in
stead of remaining on board the wrecks.
The cost of the maintenance of the ser
vice during the year was Jl.b35.936.
The general superintendent calls atten
tion to the justice and necessity of an in
crease in the compensation of district su
perintendents, who he belieVt'8 are tho
poorest paid servants of the Government,
considering' the nature and extent of their
duties and their heavy financial .Respon
sibility, and he makes a strong plea In
their behalf.

McGovern wan at him the miuute he anise and
tried hard for a knockout. Broad held on
with all his strength in the attempt to stay
the limit, but without power to fight back. He
was clrariy gone, had no Ptrength left mvl

ward with MftJovern following clooe up. Broad
was hardly able to see because of the blood
that roured in his eyes, and found- It hard
to breathe because of the blood that filled his
mouth and nose. He was one red smear from
his forehead to his waist and McGovern was
littie better, all the blood, however, coming
from Bread. The bell rang with Broad han?-
Ine; on for dear life and in a half conscious
condition. The men were in the center of the
ring when the end came, and ss McGovern
turner! to go to his corner Kroad put both hands
:'n his shoulders and placing his bloody face
cloÂ«e 'to Mi-Govern's, gave him a hearty kiss.
Referee Siler awarded the decision to McGov
ern
After the fight James J. Corbett entered
the ring and read the following challenge:
"Firstâ I will box James J. Jeffries six
rounds before the Tattersall's Athletic
Club and will agree to give him 75 per
cent of the purse, win or lose.
"Secondâ If Mr. Jeffries does not think
that six rounds is a fair test, I will box
him twenty or twenty-five rounds, or to
â¢i finish, before any club in the country
offering; the best inducements, winner to
take all."
The challenge was received with loud
cheers and calls for a speech. Corbett
said in reply to the call:
â¢*1 will box Mr. Jeffries here any time
he likes, and erlve him 75 per cent, win or
lose. That's all I can Bay."

BATTERS AND WHIPS
FIST-FIGHTER BROAD
PUGILISTS, RACEHORSES AND HOUNBS IN CONTEST
After considering carefully the specifications
of defendants as to ' the failure of the record
to disclose, a . crime under the ordinance -and
after reading attentively the evidence Itself. I
am not prepared to say that the court below
was not Justified In finding that the defendants
made a bet In the city and county of - Ran
Francisco or that "there Is no evidence of bet
tin* in a system of registering bets or -wagers."
I am of the opinion that the trial court found
in the evidence- support for Its conclusion suffi
cient successfully to withstand an, attack on
appeal.
â¢' Judgment was rendered yesterday after
noon. The opinion was Â¦written by Judge
Burnett, but he was not present, and it
was read by Judge Cook. Substantially
it is as follows:
The poolsellers have not succeeded in
their attempt to evade the law by carry-
Ing on a so-called commission .business,
which consists of accepting bets here and
transmitting them by- telegram to Oster
hout Uros., .in San Jose, to be "placed.
With the object of ; > making, a test case
Harry Corbett, Walter Mclnerney, his
clerk, and William Daley, telegraph op
erator in his poolrooms, were arrested for
violating- the ordinance. The case was
heard before Judge Mogan and the de
fendants were convicted. They appealed
'to the Superior Court, and Judges Cook
and Dunne and Judge Burnett of Sonoma
County sat In tank' and heard; the argu
ments Of Attorney Coffey for the prosecu
tion and Attorney Collins for the defend
ants. â¢ } ' 'Â¦
In considering the question whether all the
evidence shows that the bet, it any, was made
In San Jose, a significant circumstance to re
member Is that no one testified that any tele
gram was actually sent to San Jose. The cir
cumstantial evidence would at least support
the conclusion that no communication was had
with Kan Jose at all; if so. the bet was actual
ly made in San Francisco.
Lieutenant Martin gives an Interesting ac
count of what occurred at Corbett' s. It ts not
necessary to detail the breezy narrative. It
creates the Impression that It was a prear
ranged affair to invite the police force of the
city to an exhibition of a beautiful and effec
tive nullification of ordinance No. 86.
In the absence of any direct evidence to the
contrary the Judgment ought not to be dis
turbed even though It rest upon the conclusion
that no telegram was sent to San Jose, but
that the transaction was Initiated and con
summated In San Francisco.
Assuming the bet was actually telegraphed
to San Jose to the principals, there was no di
rect communication between them and Daley,
but the offer to bet was made by Daley and
was accepted by Corbett, and the bet was con
summated in San Francisco. The bet was not
accepted in San Jose -in- any event, but was
made In San Francisco with Corbett, either
for himself or as the agent of the principals in
Ban Jose. It matters not whether Corbett may
have communicated with his principals before
accepting the bet. If he was the - atrent his
act was the act of his principals. The ulti
mate fact is that he accepted it in Ban Fran
cisco and Is equally guilty, whether principal or
agent, under section 31 of the Penal Code.
. I . think 'Â¦ there , vu sufficient proof that the
defendants made a bet in San , Francisco in a.
system . of : re&l8terlnn bets Â¦ or i wagers^to, .up
hold a conviction under the complaint.. â¢
I Judge Dunne concurred and Judge Cook
concurred in the "Judgment and order."
District Attorney Bylngton said ho was
ready to proceed with the argument on
the other three appeal cases to decide
what constitutes' a .pool and iolher points
but Attorney Collins objected unless the"
statements on appeal In all the othe?
cases were. filed, as- he wanted to makl
one argument suffice for all /cases. He
had previously expressed >hlg earnest de
sire to argue the .three/ appeals-cases in
which all technicalltieswerl^wav^d With
out reference to /the- Â¦ others ' and- hi*
change of front surprised Th* ? District 'At
torney. who after consulting with -It tor
ney Coffey said the other statements on
appeal would he ready in tfmeiTX ar
guments were set for Saturday. It was
?hÂ« lly a^ eed that the arguments on an
the appeal cases would be heard in bank
Monday morning In Judge Cook', court?
- Attorney Collins asked fqr a stay of ex
ecution for ten days, as he desired to pre
sent a petition for rehearing v on \ha pdint
referred to by. Judge Cook. He said he
had numerous authorities to prove that
there was sufficient evidence Jn the record
to show that the telegram had been sent
Judge Cook - remarked that anything in
i. it regard would not alter the facts, and
ho did not see the necessity of a reheir
ing. but after consulting ; with . Judge
Dunne a stay, of ten days was granted to
enable Collins to file the petition for re-
Judge Cook remarked that. there was ab
solutely no proof that the telegram had
been sent or received at San Jose ana if
there had been It might have changed his
opinion. Ho concurred, in the judgment of
Judge Burnett, but not altogether injiia
opinion. â¢

The dead man was a pioneer in this

eter. Otsego County. New York. He was
initiated apprentice Mason on December
10, 1S50, in the Lafayette Lodge, Nevada
City. In October, 1S85, he was elected
grand commander of the Mother Supreme
Council of the world, this making him
the highest Mason in the world and holder
of one of the three golden keys which
open the Ark of the Covenant. He held
the key for the Southern Judiciary, and
now that death has come the Ark must
be sealed until his successor is elected,
which will not be until the consistory of
the Thirty-third Degree Masons meet,
which will be subject to the call of Deputy
Commander Rlehardson. The head
quarters are at Washington, D. C, and
it is there that the Supreme Consistory
will probably meet. He leaves a wife and

76, of an Internal complaint, at
his home, 2642 Howard street, after an ill
ness of ten months, in which the flame of
life brightened at times, only to diÂ«Â» out
at last despite all the hopes his medical
attendants had of pulling him through.
He was created a Companion of the Red
Cross and Knights Templar on April 11,
1885, In the Sacramento Commandery No.

and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free
masonry from the fourth to the thirty
second in October. 1S67. by communication
from Kbenezer H. Shaw, thirty-third de

of California. He was elected an active

Mr. Caswell's Masonic career is one of

cently adopted for the conduct of its af
fairs. Already several of them have been
abrogated and Borne omissions in the gen
eral list have been supplied. The latest
rfiscovery is that made by Miss M. L.
O'Neal, principal of the llaguna Honda
School, who in her report filed with Super
intendent Webster yesterday calls atten
tion to a conflict between the rule of the
board and the course of study relating 1 to
home work. Section 90 of the rule pro
vides that no home lessons shall be as-
Fijrned to the pupils of the first, second,
third and fourth grades. The course of
study provides that three-quarters of an
hour shall be devoted to home work. This
conflict will necessitate a revision of the
rules in that connection, and Chairman
Mark states that action will be taken im
mediately to reconcile the conflicting: pro
visions.
The board will meet this morning and
take steps to provide for semi-annual pro
motions in some of the grades. At present
promotions are only made seml-annually
from the advanced eighth grades to the
High School. While no decision has yet
been reached it has been practically de
rided to have eemi-annual promotions in
the sixth and seventh grades, and the
plan may be extended tÂ» some of the other
grades.

California Â¦will have an exhibit of its re
sources at the Pan-American Exhibition
to take place at Buffalo next year, and
without State appropriation. This was
decided upon at a meeting oi the direc
tors of the State Board of Trade which
was held yesterday afternoon. Some time
ago a communication was received from
the men at the head of the Buffalo exhi
bition, offering to give this State a very
large proportional allowance of space in
the horticultural building, and also In
closing a diagram of the horticultural
building, from which it was made to ap
pear that California could have the posi
tion on both sides of the main entrance,
so that it would have the first and last
chance to greet the many tnousands of
visitors who will be in attendance. This
caused gTeat satisfaction. A fortnight
ago \V. H. Mills urged that the board
6hould take steps to secure an adequate
display.- and the proposition was favora
bly received.
At the meeting of the board yesterday
Mr. Mills again brought up the subject,
end said that there would be in attend
ance great throngs of people to whom
California's products ought to be made
known. He tUso had considerable advice
of a practical sort to give concerning the
preparation of goods for*exhlbitlon pur
poses and also for sale in foreign mar
kets. The criticism that he made of the
manner in which the American wares
were displayed at Paris was that they
were arranged as Americans would
like lo have them, but that they
were not put up according to the taste of
the Europeans. It was possible to rem
edy that defect at the Buffalo exhibition.
In his opinion it would pay those who in
tended to engage in snipping California
products to Europe to have some one in
vestigate and report what the Europeans
Â¦want and how to prepare it lor them.
Colonel John P. Irish also spoke con
cerning the Buffalo exhibition, indorsing
the proposition to have California repre
eented. The following was adopted:
Â¦tt'heâ m. The California State Board of
Trade has been allotted space In the horti
cultural building of the Pan American Ex
position to b* held at Buffalo in the year 1901;
therefore. txÂ» it
Resolved, That this board will make a col
lective exhibit of the resources of the State of
California in the spare thus allotted.
Rea olved. further. That the coord will not
seek financial aid through legislative appro
priation.

Several Jobbing houses have practically
boycotted the Selby Smelting 'and Lead
Company's lead products and a lead war
Is raging, to the general demoral
ization of prices. The jobbers op
posed to Selby are largely patronizing
Eastern manufacturers In preference to
the Selby Company, the purpose being to
force the company to do certain things.
The principal object is to prevent, the
Selby Company from dealing directly with
the plumbers and the retail trade In all
lead and some other goods that the com
pany produces. . This has precipitated a
war also in cartridge shells and ammuni
tion generally.
Other large Jobbing houses have chosen
to stand by the local manufacture re. the
laiger of these being Baker & Hamilton
8mT W. W. Montague & Co. There is a
gteat deal of ill-feeling that has been en
gt-iidered by the struggle, which is Just
reaching Its height. Judging by indica
tions. As an instance It is related that
the price of shot has been made so low
that certain parties found it profitable to
buy and melt the shot into pig lead when
it was quoted at $1 10.
The trouble originated when the Selby
Company sent out notice that It would
sell to the plumbers and the retail trade.
The notice was In the shape of a quantity
schedule, which provided for rebates onl,y
according to the quantity purchased. Prior
to this the Jobbers had a percentage of 17VJ
off with an agreement that *voÂ«!d allow
"Vi per cent rebate to the plumbers. The
latter reported that they were not get
ting this rebate and were ready to go
Hast for goods. Then came the quantity
schedule, which has made all the trouble.
Large quantities of Eastern goods have
been Â¦ brought here to take the place of
the products of the Seiby Company. Tho
local lead makers have met' every price
that has been made, and are carrying on
their side of the flght with vigor. Shot
made by Selby. is reported by^ local deal
ers to be selling now In the open market
at $1 25, when the same quality of shot
i made in the East according to trade re
ports costs $1 30 when laid down in San
Francisco. Manufactured lead Is, there
fore, being sold at an actual loss.
Sheet lead and lead pipe are similarly
reduced in price owing to the lead war.
Plumbers are purchasing wherever they
can find the lowest rates and are gener
ally satisfied with the situation. ' Sport
men are laying in stocks of ammunition
while the war lasts. The shot tower and
lead works on First street and the car
tridge factory at Vallejo Junction, both
operated by the Selby Company, are turn
ing out large quantities of goods for the
local competitive trade under the war con-
Selby Company's Decision to
Deal With Retailers
Is the Cause.

If the people of Boston can do all that. San Fran
cisco surely ought to be able to do much more for
the public library of this city than has been done.
Our library is inconveniently located in the City Hall,
having no building of its own whatever, and as long
as it remains- there it will never, be so widely used
as it should be. The Boston example is worth im
itating. 'Â¦;>' Â¦-:
The institution thus built up by the people without
aid from millionaires is not only a reference but a
circulating library, and every effort is made to render
its books accessible to all /the people. Books are
taken home from the library by a system of cards,
and 63,881 persons out of Boston's population of
500,000 make use of the cardsâ that is to say, one per
son in every eight. A record fs kept of the holders,
classified by age and sex; 26,480 males took books
home, of these 14,003 were over and 11*587 under 21
years of age; the number of females using cards was
37,401, divided into 23,912 over 21 years of age and
13,489 under that age. Among these were 919 gram
mar school boys and girls under 12 years of age. The
total number of volumes taken. from the library and
its branches during the year was 1,251,541.
The library building at Boston with its artistic deco
rations cost $3,000,000 and it contains upward of
750,000 volumes; yet the whole institution is the out
come of public taxation willingly borne by the people.
It is stated that private contributions to it after nearly
fifty years of existence amount to only $273,740 in
all, of which sum one-half has been contributed with
in the last eleven years. The Bates gift, made in 1853.
was of $50,000, and only two other gifts of equal size
have been received since,- one. in 1889, the other in
1897; there are seven gifts of $10,000; the others are
for much smaller amounts.
BOSTON is feeling proud over the forty-eighth
annual report of the trustees of her famous
public library. There is nothing in this particu
lar report that renders it distinguished above others,
so that the pride Boston feels in it is due merely to
the fact that it once more reminds her of what she
has accomplished in the way of building up a library,
and how much better in that respect she is than any
other city in the country.
A LESSON FROM BOSTON.
The costume represented Is for travel-
Ing. It is of drab covert-cloth. The point
ed lapels are edged with embroidered de
signs in braid to match, and the skirt ia
trimmed in the same style. The waistband
is of violet silk, draped.
DRAB CLOTH COSTUME.
It is claimed for the battleship Kentucky that she
has deposed the Oregon as the new queen of the
navy, having made the voyage from New York to
Gibraltar in exactly twelve days at an average speed
of 14 knots. As the distance, however, is only 3186
knots between the two points, and not 4000 knots, the
actual average speed simmers down to 11.07 knots,
which is quite creditable for a ship with engines not
yet worked down to their bearings; but the Oregon's
run in 1898 from Puget Sound to Jupiter Inlet, Fla.,
covered a distance of 14,^10 miles, and was accom
plished at an average speed of 11.17 knots. It is a
record not yet beaten by any naval vessel, and the
Oregon is still the queen of all navies.
FROM present appearances it would seem that
the nations concerned propose to take blood
atonement out of China, in lieu of money in
demnity or territorial concessions.
The authenticated accounts of slaughter of non
combatants by the troops of Russia, France and
Germany have doubtless impressed the world with
the idea that these allies collected an eye for an eye
und a tooth for a tooth as they went marching on.
When to this is added the execution of Chinese of
high degree, Moloch should soon be glutted with
blood.
To demand an impoverishing indemnity in money,
after all this slaughter, looting, destruction of prop
erty and bringing famine upon all North China, ought
to satisfy the most vengeful of the missionaries. It
may be pleaded that killing Chinese is no punishment
but rather a favor to the nation in its overcrowded
condition, and that the only sensitive nerve in the
Mongol anatomy is in the pocket. But the Western
conscience is not concerned with the effect of all this
butchery upon China. Its evil is impressed upon the
people of the nations that have set up the shambles
and reddened them with the blood of thousands of
innocent women and children.
Above the noise of all the horror, the pleading of
missionaries in the agonies of torture and murder, and
the weak cries of Chinese infants being tossed from
bayonet to bayonet in retaliation, conscience is heard
declaring that the cause of jit all is the deliberate inter
polation of a forgery by a missionary .in the treaty
of i860.
China was then prostrate under the iron heels of
France and England. Peking had been looted anl
partly burned. The treaty in its best aspect was tht
fruit of duress, and China was not a free agent at the
moment of her assent. Her helplessness was further
taken advantage of by the forger who adulterated the
treaty by a provision giving missionaries access to
the Middle Kingdom, with the right to own or rent
property in which to carry on a propaganda.
In all the Christian world is there not a Xavier or
a Hcber to rise and vindicate the true spirit of Chris
tianity by declaring the truth and admitting the
wronp-? The author of Christianity said that his fol
lowers would be known by swearing to their own
injury, meaning that they would tell the truth when
it meant their own undoing.
It is a matter for pride in this country that our
Government has kept the nearest of any to Christian
ideals in its dealing with China. But American
Christians are not pleased that many missionaries who
are Americans have criticized our Government for
this attitude and have openly voiced their preference
for the truculent attitude of the Kaiser.
It iÂ« a hard world at best, but the hardest part of it
Fhouid not be found where Christianity is professed.
THE CHINESE SETTLEMENT.
Buffalo, New Orleans and St. Louis have an
nounced expositions for the near future. There will
be no use for any other American city to undertake
one during a year in which one of those is to be
held, but when the expositions at St. Louis and New
Orleans have fitly celebrated the acquisition of the
vast Louisiana territory by the Union it will be the
turn of the Pacific Coast to have a national celebra
tion and an international fair. It will be worth whils
for our people to keep the subject in mind. Since
expositions are so popular, why should not San Fran
cisco begin to plan one of the first magnitude?
Such a showing refutes the theory that expositions
have lost favor with the people. In fact, it proves
that nothing is so attractive to the masses of civilized
men of our time as expositions of art and industry.
All classes delight in seeing with their own eyes what
has been accomplished for the advancement of hu
man welfare by the attainments of science and the
improvements of mechanism. Consequently the out
look for the expositions projected in this country i3
most favorable, and it is well nigh certain that those
cities that have made plans on a grand scale will reap
an abundant reward for their energies.
The summary of the official statistics telegraphed
yesterday states that the total number of visitors was
double that of the exposition of 1889, when 25,121,975
persons passed the gates. When the gates of the ex
position of 1900 closed more than 50,000,000 persons
had passed through. The British and Belgians
headed the list in 18S9 in point of numbers, but this
year the Germans were first and the Belgians sec
ond, with the British behind. The Americans also
formed a very noticeable contingent. Indeed they
were immeasurably more numerous than at the! pre
vious exposition. The record paying day this year
brought out more than 600,000 visitors, as compared
with a maximum of 335,377 in 1889.
AFTER all reports of the comparative failure of
the Paris Exposition comes the final state
ment of the authorities, showing that so far as
popularity is concerned it has been the most success
ful exposition ever held. Notwithstanding that wars
in South Africa, disturbances in China, racial antago
nisms growing out of the old wars in Europe, and
trade rivalries, tended to keep many foreigners from
visiting the fair, and notwithstanding that royalty
held aloof and not a single great sovereign visited the
city, the attendance was enormous.

PERSONAL MENTION.
A Fenninane Wank in a Windy City Drug Store
Converts a Harmless Beverage Into
, a Biting Serpent.
"Drunkenness Among All Classes of Women In Chicago" was the text for
& special dispatch recently published in the New York "World, which went
on to say that the alarming increase of the vice was made the subject
of discussion by the national executive board of the Woman's Rescue
League.
Proprietors of drug- stores and candy stores -were condemned for the al
leged practice of Belling "spiked" drinks to young girls, many of whom. It
was said,! were often Induced to drink Intoxicants when under the Impres
sion that they were partaking of a harmless beverage.
"It is this practice of mixing intoxicants with soda-fountain drinks,"
said Mrs. M. Palmer, editor of the Banner of God, the official organ of the
league, "that causes many of our young women to become t-ddlcted to the
habit, and that Is greatly responsible for the frightful Increase of Inebriety
among our sex."
Mrs. Ida Cole, national corresponding secretary, said: "I am surprised at
the amount of liquor sold to women residents of Hyde Park, where I live un
der the cover of groceries. Several times men have called at my house solic
iting orders for beer, wine and whisky, assuring me that I need have no
fear of detection. 1 was told at a grocery store that every grocery dealer In
Hyde Park sold liquor, not only at retail, but at wholesale."
CHICAGO LADIES TAKE THEIRS
WITH A LITTLE "SPIKE" IN IT
Upon those questions the people have passed. The
vote against the scheme is decisive. The victory is
one upon which the State may well be congratulated.
Such reforms as are needed in our judicial system
can be effected without the establishment of new
courts. There is no necessity to reorganize the whole
judicial system, throw everything into confusion ani
add to the burdens of the taxpayers, nor is there any
need to give the Governor the appointment of nine
additional Judges.
The Call has a just right to feel gratification in the
defeat of the amendment, since it took the leading
part in the campaign of education against it, and
peatedly pointed out the objections to it, while at the
same time giving ample opportunity to its advocates
to make what defense they could. Thus The Call
published in full several letters from persons favoring
the plan, so that no complaint can be justly made of
unfairness in presenting the issue. The readers of
The Call had both sides of the controversy submitted
to them, and after a comprehensive study of the sub
ject decided The Call was right, in opposing it.
]T~\ETURNS from the interior of the State make it
lâS certain that the scheme for establishing three
* courts of appeal, embodied in Senate constitu
tional amendment No. 22, has been defeated. This
is another evidence that the voters approached the
polls this year with a clear understanding of all the
issues before them. The scheme had hardly a single
argument in its favor, and the objections against it
were overwhelming. Consequently the people re
jected it. ' >

AN "AGGIE"- NIZING MOMENT.
NETV YORK POSTâ Croker and his con
federates begin by stealing the nama of
Democrats; they end. through the cohe
sive power of public plunder, with what
they call a political oriBranlzatlon, but what
is In reality a kind of Camorra. It exists
In, for and by crime. It thrives on flaunt

by the rich. Croker. the chief bandit. Is
a living embodiment of the spirit which
animates the wholeâ his Ignorance, his
greed, his brutality, his affiliation with

PHILADELPHIA INQUIRERâ Now that
we have gone abroad to sell the products
which we have the capacity for producing

It is impossible to set any Hmit3 to our

the other staples which successful manu
facture requires, and with an Inventive
capacity which Is nowhere even approach

the greatest nation upon earth seems to be
assured beyond peradventure.
NEW YORK TIMESâ Opposition to
Bryanism Involved no risk of negro su
premacy In any Southern State. And cer
tainly the South would have paid uncon
scionably dear for whatever advantage
may accrue from maintaining a solid front
against negro rule if its votes had actual
ly elected a President who had pledged
himself to policies that would have
brought widespread disaster upon its
prosperous Industries and checked its
development for a decade.
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRE Râ Th*
country hasn't. In spite of the extraordin

running Into debt. There Is still a hand
some amount to the good at the dispo

There was, indeed, an actual surplus of
more than three million dollars during the
month of October, which Is a gratifying
circumstance indicating a healthy condi
tion of business affairs.

NASHVILLE AMERICAN-Most of the

CHICAGO INTER-OCEANâ Congress
has made a good beginning of the new
task by upbuilding our navy. But our
naval growth must continue In an order

ships which, if action be not taken soon,
must lie Idle for lack of men to command
them.
RICHMOND TIMESâ If the rarty will

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
There has long been a controversy whether irriga
tion shall be undertaken by States and Territories or
by the National Government. That controversy
ought now to be closed. It is certain that in many
respects the problem is too vast to be solved by separ
ate State action, but in some ways the States might
help. Thus there is ample room for a basis of agree
ment among all who sincerely desire to see the great
and needed work begun at once. It is to be hoped
the present congress will devise a plan of operatidn
on which all can agree.
Governor of any State or Territory, any member of
the United States Senate and House of Representa
tives, and member of any State or Territorial commis
sion.
The vote in West Virginia, Maryland and Dela
ware means that this is the disappearance of the solid
South, and that in the future Republican majorities
may be looked for in the manufacturing States of the
South. Physical environment is the final cause of
political preference, and the climate that produces cot
ton, rice, sugar and tobacco and transmutes them to
be used by man is a strictly Republican climate.
Governor Pingree of Michigan gave a mot to the
campaign by announcing that he would hold his nose
and vote for McKinley. Throughout the South
voters did not hold nor hide their noses while voting
for Bryan, but used them in an impressive sneer at the
candidate they supported while praying for his de
feat.
Compared with it the Debs movement is a higli
representative of principle. Though socialism is not
favored by the rugged American spirit, yet it is a
principle, and one that this and other countries must
reckon with for many years to come.
At this time it is more likely that the Democrats who
have a second time repudiated Bryan will prefer the
Republican party to a reorganized Democracy, and
that the artificial formation of a new party will simply.
increase Republican strength by repelling more Dem
ocrats who are tired of the shallowness, the froth and
fury of Bryanism. There are great forces at work
which will go forward regardless of the plans of poli
ticians, and promise a new alignment and a fresh par
tisan cleavage. No fact in the late campaign stands
out more clearly than the favor in which the Presi
dent and his policies were held in the South. Only
the race question prevented that section giving its
vote to the Republican party. In the South
multitudes of men voted for Bryan while not conceal
ing their fear of his election and the hope of his de
feat. Scores of such men did not scruple to offer
material assistance to the Republican campaign in the
North to offset their compulsory support of Bryan
at home. That section of the country is enjoying its
first real prosperity. Its old order under slavery was
not prosperity, but now business and industry arc
laid on lines that represent true business principles,
and an industrial structure is being built that must
depend for its endurance upon the principles and poli
cies of the Republican party.
Towne and his companions may fulminate and may
form parties in vain. Principles precede parties, and
the unprogrammed agreement of men on principle is
the nucleus of parties. In the Bryan movement there
is no enduring principle. It is a body without a. soul.
Its repudiation by Democrats is more extensive and
general this year than in 1896.
In the first year of the century Aaron Burr and
De Witt Clinton, both politicians, aspired to the Pres
idency. They sought the prize as politicians seek it,
but the people averted their favor from both and
turned to Jefferson.
Their whole movement has been inspired by mere
politicians. Bryan himself is only a politician, and a
very poor one at that. Neither he nor any man who
is only a politician or the mere agent of politicians
can ever be President. The people in selecting for
that office have always turned away from a politician
and chosen a statesman.
It is time to say that artifice cannot achieve or pre
vent the reorganization of an old party, nor create
a new one. These things must originate spon
taneously, in the nature of things. The leaders of the
Bryan movement cannot reorganize the . existing
Democracy. It would be writing their o\vn # epitaphs.
They would have to meet and vote themselves wrong
on every issue they have offered to the people. They
would have to drop every line and letter of the Chi
cago and Kansas City platforms and admit that those
documents presented no enduring principles, but were
fiamed only on the line of temporary expediency, in
the hope of catching votes and getting power.
There has been a great deal of hysterical ascription
to Colonel Bryan since his second defeat. His per
sonal demeanor and his expressions by no means ex
hibit the elements of greatness. He has made no
large-minded comment on the result, and indulges in
aspersions that are unbecoming a leader of American
thought. The country is evidently tired of him, but
he is not tired of himself, and announces that he will
continue to direct matters along the line of his two
disastrous campaigns. The builders of the proposed
new party announce, as the first part of their pro
gramme, that they will prevent Democratic reorgani
zation, and when that is done will form a new party.
IT is reported that a conference at St. Paul has de
cided to form a new party, of which Bryan is to
be the leader. The conferees were. Towne, Petti
grew, Mr. Shively of Indiana, and several other West
ern committeemen of the Bryan Democracy.

fairs of the City and County
Hospital Is being demonstrated
beyond a doubt in the investiga
tion begun yesterday by the
Board of Health into the charges pre
! ferred by Superintendent Gustave E.
ISussdorff against Commissary Joseph W.
Magulre that the latter had watered the
milk used in the institution. Maguire was
suspended from duty as a result of the
accusation by Dr.. Sussdorff, who there
upon requested the board to confirm his
action. The trouble is the direct result
of the belated discovery made by Chair
man d'Ancona of the Supervisors' Health
and Hospital Committee that the poorest
kind of milk was being served to the un
fortunate sick in the City and County
Hospital.
While the inquiry is being directed by
the Hospital Committee, of which Dr.
Bazet is chairman, with a view of get
ting at the truth of the charges made
against Maguire, the proceedings develop
| f-il the interesting fact that Dr. Sussdorff
I was as much on trial as Maguire. Inter
esting details of Sussdorff's peculiar ac
tions in connection with the administra
tion of the hospital were brought to light
which make it appear as though a "go
as-you-please" policy prevails In the in
stitution and that it is not being con
ducted for the best interests of the pa
tients. , ,
The Inquiry began with the submission
of three affidavits signed by Teter Teys
eier, D. Richards and Louis Loo, em
ployes of the hospital, who agreed In
the presence of T. Maher, as witness, that
each would be willing to swear that he
had been ordered to water the milk by
j Maguire before it was served to the pa
1 Superintendent Sussdorff was then
placed on the stand and subjected to a
deal of uncomfortable cross-questioning
by Matt Sullivan, who acted as 1 Maguire s,
' attorney, regarding his methods of com
1 pelllng the subordinates in the hospital to
minister to his creature comforts. Suss
dorff old not admit any of the accusations
but Sullivan succeeded in causing him to
squirm about uneasily in his chair. Sulli
van said his Intention was to show that
there was animus in the charges brought
by Sussdorff against Maguire and the lat
ter's consequent suspension.
"Is It not a fact?" asked Sullivan, . that
Maguire positively refused to indorse a
bill for $45 which was expended for three
pairs of fancy blankets to be used by your
family?"
Sussdorff evaded this question by say-
Ing that he had obtained permission from
the Board of Health to purchase the
blankets without the commissary's knowl
edge, thus making his own superior offi
cers parties to the irregular proceeding.
Again Sullivan demonstrated that the
coachman employed at the hospital had
been frequently engaged in driving Suss
dorff to visit his private patients during
hours when he should have been attending
to his duties as hospital superintendent.
Sussdorff said, however, that he had no
private patients at present.
Sullivan asked Sussdorff if the hospital

sions to climb trees and secure young

1 Another set of claims which will be re

The contention that the subsidy in the

Extension Company having been legahy
obtained must be continued was recog
nized as a very important one and was re
ferred to the Attorney General. His de
cision was to the effect that these claims
were not based on a contract right. But
he also held that both the cable and the
railway company had good, equitably
claims. It Is possible that the subsidy
may be paid temporarily from the reve
nues collected from the islands them
selves, but it Is the intention to refer the
whole subject to Congress in order that It
may do justice to the companies. J There
has been a good deal of correspondence
on this subject, and the British authorities
are earnestly supporting the claims of
their citizens.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â The President
will submit to Congress at the approach
ing session the claims for Indemnification
and for other substantial recompense of
the British cable corporation which suf
fered as a result of the American occupa
tion of the Philippines. The corporation
claims damages for the Interruption of
their cable business by the American
forces. This claim was reduced to a very
low figure, but was disallowed. The East
ern Extension Company claims that it has
a franchise from the Spanish Government
obtained before the war, granting it a mo
nopoly of cable business throughout the
Philippines, and that this monopoly has
been invaded by the action of the Unltoi
States Government.
1 At the same time the Manila-Dagupan
Railroad Company, the only railroad m
the Philippines, sets up a claim, first, for
just compensation for the use of Its prop
erty by the United States, and, second, for

LARGE CLAIMS
FOR INDEMNITY
Frederick V. Haberly, clerk for William
Walters, grocer, on the corner of Califor
nia and Devlsadero streets, was found
lying dead on the floor of the bathroom at
the residence, li>27 Green street, early yes
terday morning. The key of the gas burn
er was turned on to its full extent and the
room was full of the poisonous fluid. Hab
erly had taken off his hat, coat and shoes
and left them in his bedroom. He was a
natrve of Vallejo, unmarried and 24 years
old.
George W. Haberly, postofllce clerk and
a brother of the victim, was inclined to
be reticent about the affair when ques
tioned by Deputy Coroner McCormlck. He
said that his brother had very long work-
Ing hours and was consequently very
drowsy in the evenings. Frederick was
not a drinking man, and did not exhibit
â¢ny algns of liquor when he came home
on Monday evening. He lay on his bed
with his clothes on and fell asleep, and
was awakened by his brother at about 10
p. m. He went into the kitchen and fell
asleep again. At 10:30 he was once more
awakened by his brother George and ad
vised to go to bed. Frederick lighted the
gas in the kitchen and went into the bath
room, and George retired. At 6:45 o'clock*
yesterday morning he entered the bath
room and found Frederick dead.
William Haberly, another brother of the
dead man, called at the Coroner's office
yesterday afternoon and explained that
Frederick was a somnambulist, and that
he was probably walking In his sleep
when he turned on tho gas without light
ing it.

birds, some of which had been served ud
at the superintendent's dinner table in the
cook's best style, but the superintendent
replied in the negative. It developed that
Maguire had interposed vigorous objec
tions to thit= practice for humane reasons.
Similar motives impelled Maguire to re
monstrate with Sussdorff for setting his
bulldog on the hospital cats. This pro
ceeding caused an uproar one day near
the maternity ward that seeminKly dis
turbed the peace of the patients.
Sussdorff created some amusement when
he finally admitted that the cook had
provided two or three gparrows for hia
epicurean taste, but that he was sadly
disappointed in the dish.
To a question of Dr. Bazet Sussdorff said
that he had not accused Magulre of wa
tering the milk before suspending him.
"But," asked Bazet, "do you not recol
lect having told Dr. Buckley and myself
that Mapuire had admitted to you that he
had adulterated the milk?"
Dr. Buckley came to the rescue of Suss
dorff, who was nonplused for a moment,
by stating that it was possible that the
superintendent had said that some one
else had informed him that Magulre had
confessed to Catering the milk.
Sussdorff admitted that D. Richards,
who had filed the" unverified affidavit that
he had been given orders by Maguire to
water the milk, was a former patient, but
was maintained in the hospital at the
city's expense. Also that Magurre had
objected to his presence on the ground
that It was an imposition on the city to
provide for his wants.
Sussdorf would not admit that it was
the practice of stewards under former ad
ministrations to ekim the cream off the
milk, which was served to the hospital
ofllelals while the Pklmmed milk went to
the patients. He thought that under
Magulre's supervision he had noticed an
improvement in the milk, and admitted
that the expenses in the commissary de
partment under Maguire's regime had
been reduced.
The investigation was resumed In the
evening, the first witness being Chemist
Green, who testified to the correctness of
his analyses of various samples of milk
submitted to him by Dr. D'Ancona which
had been taken from the hands of pa
tients and pronounced bv him to be of a
poor quality. Green testified that two
of the samples were undoubtedly watered
milk.
Sussdorf was called for cross-examina
tion, and was asked by Dr. McCarthy if
he desired to have counsel: Sussdorff said
he had no need of counsel as a witness.
"I see Mr. Samuel Shortridge In the
room." said McCarthy, "and I under
stand he is here as your counsel."
'"I am here as Dr. Sussdorff's friend,"
said Shortridge. "but if he needs me in a
legal capacity I will represent him."
Louis Loo, the head cook of the hospital,
who signed one of the statements that
Maguire had watered the milk, stated
that five months ago he had caught Ma
guire putting water in the milk. Loo said
he told Magulre he would get into trou
ble. Loo said he had never received or
ders from Maguire to water the milk, but
he had found milk in his kitchen at least
one-third of which was water. Sullivan
drew from Loo that he had never heard
Maguire give orders to water the milk,
but when shown his signed statement that
he would swear that he had (which state
ment was produced in evidence by Suss
dorff) he replied that he had heard
Teyssier say that Maguire had watered
the milk. Loo denied that Maguire had
ever complained of the filth in his kitchen
or that tuberculosis patients had been al
lowed to work in the vegetable room.
Peter Teyssier. the vegetable man, tes
tified that Maguire had shown him how
to put water in the milk so as to increase
the number of cans supplied to the hos
pital. This practice had been going on
every day for about ten months and was
only stopped by Maguire when Dr. d'An
cona's discovery of the diluted milk was
published in the newspapers.
The investigation will be resumed this
evening.
"We wish to show that there is a con
spiracy en foot to blacken the most hon
orable commissary that the hospital has
ever had," said Sullivan. "If we can show
malice on Mr. Sussdorff's part nothing
that he can say will hurt Magulre's repu
tation."
Sussdorff was forced to admit, after
much persuasion by Sullivan, that he re
garded Magulre as an honest official and
his administration had been economical
in many respects. " Sussdorff denied that
Magulre had suggested anv reforms, par
ticularly as to the necessity for an In
spection of the hospital. â¢
Sussdorff then objected to the line of
Sullivan's questioning and was sustained
by Dr. Bazet, who held that the questions
were direct reflections on the Board of
Health. Sullivan denied that he Intended
to impugn the motives of the board.
"It seems to me." said Bazet, "that we
are only concerned here with ascertaining
who watered the milk. It is certain that
it came to the institution in standard
form and was then adulterated Jn the in
stitution."
Sussdorff would not admit that there
was any unfriendly feeling between him
self and Maguire. Dr. Bazet objected to
a question put by Sullivan as to whether
Sussdorff had inspected the hospital reg
ularly, on the ground that such a matter
was under the Board of Health's jurisdic
tion. Sullivan replied that the object of
the cross-examination was to demonstrate
Sussdorff's malicious feeling against Ma
guire. Â¦
It may be added, though, that this
limitation to the rule has caused no little
dispute. A man Is Injured by the giving
way of a floor. He did not know that it
was defective and had no reason for sup
posing It was unsafe, but the employer
knew of Its condition. In such a case he
can recover. Suppose the defects in the
floor were apparent to persons who went
over It. he could perhaps say he did not
know, but he could not say that he ought
not to have known, for others knew who
were In the way of going there llke-him
self: In one of the cases an employe was
Injured by the kick of a horse owned by
the company he was serving as hostler.
The evidence clearly showed that he
knew of the horse's vicious habits. "She
had kicked others," said the court, "and
her reputation was well known to the
persons employed in the stables, and they
were warned to guard against being in
jured by her. * â¢ * No duty was Im
posed on the company to inform him of
what he so well knew, nor to forbid his
grooming the mare. He voluntarily as
sumed the risk and continued to expose
himself to a well known danger." His
employer therefore was not liable for the
Injury. It mattered not that his master
knew of the vicious habits of the>mare.
The employe also knew, 'or ought to have
known, and so he had no right to recover
anything from his employer.
If ,he could recover In such eases after
showing that he had no actual knowledge
of the risk from which he was Injured, the
temptation would be strong In the case of |
In stating this rule one clause or fact
must not be overlookedâ the employe must
know the real condition of the appliance
or machine as fully as his employer. If
he did not ktaow, then the master's liabil
ity is quite another thing. Let us, then,
keep clearly In mind this . important
feature of the rule, that the employe
knows or ought to know Just what the ap
pliance or hazardous place is. What do
we mean by "ought to know"? That the
risk is so obvious that by the use of his
ordinary senses he can see it and under-
Etand It. If a workman were employed
to work on a well lighted floor that had
a large hole in the center and his work
was of such a nature that he could see It
if he kept his eyes open, he could hardly
sue his employer for his failure to step
over it, because he must have known
from the most ordinary experience that
no one can walk on air, however Light he
may be either in body or mind.
The reader may now ask the question,
what has become of the rule reo.uiring
employers to exercise ordinary care in em
ploying servants, appliances, etc? The
answer Is, it is and may be set aside
whenever employers and employes seo
fit to do so. In other words, It is not a
positive rule that must be kept in every
case. If an employer wishes to do other
wise, use tools, for example, that are not
suitable, and can find men who for the
sake of .employment or perhaps for the
tempting offer of higher wages are willing
to take the risk, they can bo used without
subjecting the employer to the charge of
negligence, which is always the founda
tion of an action against him by his em
ploye. If he is not guilty of this, he is
not liable, and he is regarded not guilty
when he agrees with an employe that the
latter is to run a machine or use a tool
or work in a dangerous mine or powder
mill, when he understands the risk as ful
ly as the employer himself. In all cases
of this kindâ and they are very numerous
âthe employe assumes the new or unus
ual risks himself.
Employes Must Know What They
Are Using.
The Rule Requiring the Use of Safe
Appliances May Be Set Aside.
Yet all can see the danger of an abuse
of this principle, and no doubt it is
abused every day. Workmen take risks
that ought not to be taken by them; em
ployers use machinery that ought to be
taken out and sold for old iron. Some
countries and states have statutes relating
to this subject, inspectors to visit mills
and insist on the use of safe appliances,
the boxing of machinery, the covering of
belts, eo as to prevent accidents. Such
iegulations and inspection have a good
purpose, but where they do not exist let
us repeat that employers and enr-ployes
may make contracts for using almost any
kind cf appliances and machinery, the
nature of which is known to them, with
out violating the law. The only limit is
the use. of a machine or appliance that
would be regarded as a reckless exposure
of life. A contract to do this would bo
void, and if either party were so inclined
he could decline to fulfill it.
Again, a machine or appliance may De
positively defective when an employe be
gins to use it. and yet his employer may
not be regarded as negligent in having it
used if the employe knew or had reason
to know' of its true condition. This prin
ciple is founded on several reasons. First,
an employer has the right to use his own
in any manner he pleases not contrary to
law. If he erects a mill he is not obliged
to keep it in operation; he can close it
when he pleases. So, too. if the machinery
becomes old, out of date, and even dan
gerous to run, he Is not obliged to take it
out and put in new; he can continue to
use it if he be so minded. The essential
thing for him to do is to be assured that
his operatives understand the added dan
ger wrought by time and use. If. as the
courts say, they do know, or ought by
using ordinary precaution or care to have
known the danger, it may be used with
out transferring the new or greater risk
to the employer.
Second, the courts do not consider that
an employe has done anything contrary
to law or public policy in agreeing to
operate a machine that is defective. No
deceit has been practiced on him, and he
cannot blame- his employer. He under
stands the nature of the risk quite as well
as his foreman or any one else. He acts
with his eyes wide open, and the law gives
him the fullest liberty to do so. Further
more, he would doubtless complain if the
law were otherwise and he were forbidden
to use only appliances or machines of a
prescribed make or pattern.
Danger of Using a Defective Appli
ance.
\A hat is ordinary care is a question of
fact, and therefore can be fully answered
only whenever a case happens. Yet some
partial answers have been given to the
question that are worth considering. For
example, an employer is not required to
use the newest or safest machinery. Says
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania:
"Some t-mployements are essentially haz
ardous, and It by no means follows that
an employer is l'able because a particular
accident might have been prevented by
some special device or. precaution not in
common use." The case in which this
principle was applied grew out of an ac
cident from using broad gauge cars on a
narrow gauge track. It was proved thai
the railroad company often drew such
cars on Its track, though they were not as
safe as narrower ones. But the court de
clared that this was a proper business;
that the company was not limited, when
operating Its road, to cars of the safest
kind; it could use others less safe if de
sired. There was, however, a f ule or limit
beyond which it could not go without be
coming negligent, and what was that?
"The ordinary usage of business." This
is the test that must be applied. "No
man," said the court, "is held to a higher
degree of skill than the fair average of
his trade or profession, and the standard
of due care is the conduct of the average
prudent man." There may be a better or
less dangerous way, so the court added,
but no jury can be permitted to say that
to use the usual and ordinary way, com
monly adopted by those in the same busi
ness, is negligence.
The question still remains to be dicided
in every case, was the machine, appliance,
car or other thing used that caused the
accident in common use? If so, the em
ployer has complied with the law ana
therefore is not regarded as negligent
when an accident has happened from
using it.
When a Defective Appliance May Be
Used.
As we have seen, an employer must use
ordinary care in employing his servants
and provide them with suitable or proper
tools, machinery, places for work, assist
ance and instruction or regulations. Hav
ing done this, they assume the ordinary
risks of their employment.

Again, If there are unusual risks that

So the law goes a step further and says
before he can recover he must show that

question then must always be a double
one: First, did he actually know? If hÂ»
did. then he Is cut off from recovering

ought he to have known? If he hart,
then he is also cut off. Only in thoso

Corn was moderately active. The market

The support came mainly from an operator who

CHICAGO. Nov. 13.â Wheat waa an active
market nearly all the Fesslon, but holders were
disgusted with the headlong tendency of prices
to reach a lower level. To begin with Liver
pool showed a decline in the face of the ad
vnnce In the Interior and the cash demand
was slack. December, under pressure from
longs and traders who saw profits In the short
side, opened %Q 7 Ac lower at 73%@73%e. Later
Bradstreet's statement of an Increase In the
world's visible of 7.000.000 bushels, double the
amount expected, caused Â¦ renewed liquidation
under which December melted to 72fÂ£c and
closed weak, l'Agi^c under yesterday at 72"Â«
@73c. .
NEW YORK. Nov. IS.â To-day's relapse In
prices was quite vigorously contested by Â«omt
Important Interests still long on stock or which
had fixed on a still higher price level as de
sirable to unload old holdings. But the re
action was too closely in accord with skilled
opinion and observation to be opposed wl'-h
hearty conviction. The real question this morn
ing was not whether prices would decline, but
how far the decline would extend. The quej
tion still remained unanswered when the mar
ket closed with speculative liquidation etllr iu
force and prices on the down grade except
where professional shorts were taking profits
by covering their contracts. As a result of
the day's trading prices in a number of prom
inent Industrials, Including Sugar, Tennessefl
Coal and Wire and People's Gas scored de
clines of from 3 to 4 points and Metropolitan
Street Railway lost 4V A still larger list of
industrials fell between 2 and 3 points and in
the railroad list but a few losses between 1
and 2. The more substantial commission
houses In the street have been advising their
customers for days past to take their profits
and to buy no more stocks for the present.
Professional operators. except some of the
speculative pools, have sold out on a very
extensive scale and taken their profits. Up
to this time since the election buyers outside
the street have been unheedful of their broken
advance and have continued to buy stock with
out much discrimination. Yesterday late In
creasing prices had the Inevitable effect which
no amount of advice could have, discouraging
some of the outside demand. The extent 10
which the advance bad gone made the market
as a matter of course topheavy. filled as it
was with many speculative accounts on light
margins and backed by weakening holders.
Professional bear speculators who have been
alertly looking for the moment of reaction
ever since Wednesday, found that the free
Belling for the first time was not effectually
absorbed. Their efforts were redoubled and
when prices began to make wide declines stop
loss orders were dislodged and the fall thus
precipitated. The bears were in more reckless
mood and were quick to take profits, causing
frequent rallies as they covered their short
contracts. "While some outside demand con
tinued during the day lt was' at no time re
sumed in force. The resumption of selling for
London account dissipated the hope of an
enormous short demand for that account to be
covered. If London is still short In the New
York market lt Is on contracts due at some
future settlement and the continued selling
from there Indicates an unchanged conviction
that a reaction in prices will intervene here
before that time. The expectation of a large
war loan to be floated In London depressed
that market and was a direct influence In New
York as well. It emphasized the apprehension
hitherto felt of a further German Governmei t
loan also. It is not to be supposed that with
the huge Indebtedness of the foreign money
markets to the United States the foreign Gov
ernment authorities can hope to successfully
float their loans without assistance from the
American market and believe that an outward
flow of gold from New York would probably bi
necessary.
Business In bonds was on a large scale and
there was free profit-taking in demand and of
the speculative Issues, while others advanced
strongly. Total sales, par value, $4,770,000.
All United States bonds declined >4 per cent
In the last call except the new 4s, which ad
vanced V4 per cent.

Weather Report.
The continued warm, dry weather has not
been favorable for agricultural interests, as
the unusually hiph temperature and low humid
ity have caused rapid evaporation from the
â¢soil, ar.d the effect is noticeable in citrus or
chards in some localities. Oranges and lemons
have colored ra.pidly under tbe influence of the
bright sunshine, and there Is some danger that
the fruit may ripen prematurely. The orange
crop now being gathered Is said to be of ex
cellent quality, and it is expected the yield
will be above averaire. Walnut picking is near
ly completed. Apples and berries are plentiful.
The water supply is holding out very well.
Eureka summary â Apple picking iÂ» practical

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Warm, cry weather has continued through

The chief influence In the markets here to
day was the news that Parliament will re
assemble early In December to make further
provision for war expenditures. It Is under
stood that the requirements amount in all to
about $30,000,000. The concensus of opinion Is
that a new "'khaki loan" Is Improbable and
that the Government Is more likely to make a
further Issue of consols or a loan secured by
the revenues of the Transvaal and the Orange
River State with a British guarantee.
Americans were much quieter and inclined
to hesitate on the conviction of London proflt
taklng. but support from New York helped to
make the tone fairly steady and make fluctua
tions quite narrow. Northern Pacific securi
ties and Reading first preferred were the best
features.

on the vaudeville stage.
MIES IOXE MacLOUTH, cousin
of "Hero" Hobson. will make
her debut next Sunday after
noon on the professional
vaudeville etage. She will ap
pear at the Orpheum.
The young lady Is only 15 years old, but
displays rare talent In dramatic work and
Is the fortunate owner of a beautiful
soprano voice of great feeling. Her spe
ciality consists of singing old Scotch x and
other ballads in costume. She made her
first bow to a San Francisco audience In
the Brownies at the California Theater
and made such a hit that her mother has
eventually listened to the advice of friends
and will allow the pretty young girl to
adopt a profession that certainly is her
destiny.
Miss MacLouth was born in the Fame
town as Hobson â Greensboro, Alabamaâ
and besides being a relative is a warm
friend of "the man who blew up the Mer
rimac." The family moved to this coast
and Miss MacLouth waa educated in a
convent In San Rafael.
Mrs. MacLouth Is well Known in this
city and when the Tennessee regiment
was here ehe was ever to be found at
their camp, relieving the sick and doing
all in her power to make the soldiers' life
less Irksome. When Colonel Smith's body
was brought to this city from the Philip
pines Mrs. MacLtouth. who was known as
"the mother of the Tennessee boys," at
the urgent request of the regiment trav
eled back to Tennessee with the body and
saw It Interred In the Sunny South.

day of Charles Stewart, a teamster resid

latives and friends of the. young man
much uneasiness. It was learned yester
day that Stewart took passage on the
steamer Elder Friday for Portland. The
motives that prompted his departure are
still a mystery.
Stewart lacks a month of belnp 21 years
old. He has been engaged to Miss Cora
Smith oi 8*1 Harrison street, with whose
parents he has made his home for several
years. The young people were planning to
be married soon after he should become
of age. Young Stewart has been driving
a team that was part of the small estate
left by his father at his death several
years ago. Friday he turned his team
over to another man, saying he was not
well, but would be back again by Satur
day evening to take charge of the team.'
Sunday came and Stewart had not re
turned. The Smiths grew uneasy and re
ported the case to the police. A detective
learned that Stewart had drawn $18. his
deposit of savings, out of the bank. Tes
terdav Clarence Smith, a chum of Stewart
and the brother of his fiancee, learned that
Stewart was a passenger on the Elder for
Portland. Since learning that much the
Smiths and Stewart's brothers and sisters
are no longer particularly uneasy. They,
as well as the employes at thÂ« commis
sion house of Paul Keyser, for whom
Stewart did teaming, are convinced that
he became discouraged and decided sud
denly . to try another field. ' For. two
months he had not made expenses with
his team, and that furnishes the only mo
tive for his disappearance that can be
conjectured. Â¦ "â¢ ' Â¦

HIS BEDRIDDEN W1FJ5
Jn#Â» Joseo. who lives at 731 Filbert street,
is the most brutal man the police have
encountered In '-ears, lie Is now an in
mate of the City Prison, with two charges
against himâ one of drunkenness and the
other of failure to provide for his minor
children. The first charge was 'made
against Joseo when he was taken into
custody last Sunday night and the second
charge was placed against him on the
prison register after Secretary â¢ M. J.
White and Officer McMurray of the So
ciety for tue a revention of Cruelty to
Children had Investigated the ease.
Joseo's conduct toward his wife and
family has been extremely hrutal. He has
lodged his wife and children In two small
rooms and has neither provided food for
his offspring nor sought work. According
to the Humane Society officers. Joseo has
worked but five days in as many months.
Kvery dollar that his hard-working wife
has earned by doing outside housework
and washing has been appropriated by
the husband and spent for drink.
On Sunday night Mrs. Joseo gave birth
to a child, and while lying in bed told her
husband to go to the closet and take a.
portion of the 60 cents she had managed
to save and go out and buy some medi
cine and food for herself and babies. The
brutal fellow took the entire savings and
went to a grog shop and laid In a supply
of whisky and red wine, and after filling
himself with the liquids staggered hornÂ©
and demanded more money from the bed
ridden woman. She upbraided him for
his cruelty and swore that he had taken
the last cent from her. He then turned
on his defenseless wife and showered,
blows and curses upon her. Th*.poor
woman's screams attracted the 'Attention
of her neighbors and they rushed to her
rescue. The cowardly husband waa pre
vented from further attacking his wife
by the neighbors and he vented his spleen
on them. A policeman was called and he
took Joseo to the station-house.
Secretary White learned from the neigh
born that they had furnished Mrs. Joseo
with food and clothing from time to time.
They could 111 afford to do this, but the
wretched condition of the woman ap
pealed to their sympathetic hearts.
The attention of the Associated Chari
ties has been called to the condition of
Mrs. Joseo and her children and Immedi
ate action will be taken.
OLD and sick, without food or
medicine, Senora Jesus Roman
dia lies In a little scantily fur
nished room in an old tene
ment house at 1318 Dupont
street. Senora Romandia is 78 years old,
and for the last ten months has subsisted
on the charity of neighbors, all of whom
are poor and have tasted want and know
what misery means. She has an only
son, a man 62 years of age, who Is nearly
blind. Romandia earns a meager exist
ence by doing chores for. the various keep
ers of cheap saloons that flourish in his
district, and can do but little for himself
and still less for his old mother. The room
In which the poor senora lives boasts only
of two wooden chairs and a little old
stove. She lies on a narrow cot, all hud
dled up In a breathing heap. The clothes
that cover her emaciated old body are
worn, but, like the poor, bare room, they
are scrupulously clean.
The old lady has scarcely ten words of
English at her command, but she needs
no tongue to tell her pitiful tale. Her
wrinkled old face, her patient old eyes
and her pathetic, worn hands speak for
her.
"Sickâ no doctorâ no medicine," Is nil
she can mange to say. but the way her
eyes seek the little picture of the Virgin
and the child which hangs Just over her
bed tells plainly of her longing for eternal
rest.
In the rambling old tenement where
Senom Romandia lives many poor old
Spanish people find a cheap shelter. These
people have been extremely kind to the
little old lady in her trouble, sharing their
limited supply of food with her, and now
and then in their unselfishness going the
length of giving her a few small coin*.
"What Senora Romandia needs most,"
explained one who could speak better
English than the others. "Is the money
for her rent. It Is $1 a month. Her son
manages to pay It In meager installments,
but the fact that the rent Is - frequently
due for weeks before payment worries the
old lady. Then she needs food and she
needs clothingâ and that Is all."
Yes, that Is all. Old and poor and sick
and without food, without clothing and
without money to pay the rent.

into harness and with axes and buckets
joined in the rush to the woman's assist

the feet did not move.
"Drag him out," cried the woman, and
a fireman poked a pole forward and
hooked the shoes. As he fell backward on
the floor and the leather struck the wall
the mystery was solved. Without a word

PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE
ANTI-SALOON FIGHT NOW
WAGING IN BERKELEY.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13.-The
temperance people of this city
are determined that the anti
saloon ordinance shall not be
repealed, but that It shall be
enforced! They have taken steps to se
cure evidence against saloon men and
some arrests will probably be made to
morrow. The Anti-Saloon League is pay
ing for the detective work and will en
deavor to force a prosecution.
O. O. May, a prominent business man of
this city and president of the Anti-Saloon
League, declares that the existing prohibi
tory ordinance is all right and lays' the
blame for its non-enforcement at the door
of Town Marshal Richard Lloyd, who, he
declares, has failed to secure evidence and
make arrests.
"We have become tired of waiting on the
Town Marshal and the courts," said Mr.
May this evening, "and we have taken the
matter into our own hands. We have been
working alone quietly for some time, but
within the past two weeks we have com
menced active work against the saloon
men. We are securing evidence against
them and will make arrests and see that
the law is enforced. A determined stand
has been taken by us and before the next
meeting of the Trustees we shall be
heard from.
"The Town Marshal has neglected his
duty. He should have seen that the law
waa enforced in the same manner that ho
would enforce a law against robbery.
Every one say3 that he is in with the sa
loon men. We are tired of waiting on him
and have gone ahead ourselves.
"This ordinance shall be enforced. If
it be repealed we will get another."
Town Trustee K. Q. Turner said this
afternoon: "I upheld the ordinance when
it was passed and I shall stand by it. 1
see no reason for its repeal. The law
is all right, and the fault lies with the
Town Marshal, who has failed to enforce
it. The blame should be placed whero
it belongs, and it is certain that the Mar
shal has not done his duty. When ;t
comes to a vote I do not believe the or
dinance will be repealed. Trustees Dowd.
Hoff and Staats will undoubtedly vota
A. W. Naylor, president of the First
National Bank of Berkeley, who with J.
I* Barker paid this city a sum of money
equal to liquor licenses for one year on

"If this ordinance Is repealed the Trus
tees will be brought to account by an ln
dlgrant people. The law can b*> enforced.
I do not believe the saloonkeepers are a
set of outlaws who cannot be controlled.
This law can be enforced Just the same as
any other law. You might just as w*H
?av a law apralnsr stealing could not bÂ«
enforced and should be repealed. ThlÂ»
will be heard from before the next meet
ing of the Trustees. The people will have
something to say."
It is quite evident that therÂ© â¢3H11 bo
some exciting times In Berkeley before
the Trustees again meet. And when that
meeting does com* the friends of thÂ«
saloon and the temperance people will be
out in force.
Out of the peven Trustees four have de
clared the temperance ordinance a farce.
They have branded It as a complete fail
ure "and a detriment to the town. I.lauor Is

The bay shore in the vicinity of the
giant works !s lined with manufactories
of explosives, but the arrangements are
such that rarely Is more than one building
wrecked, unless the explosions are unusu
ally Berious. The Isolation of structures Is
made as complete as possible, and the
buildings where the high explosives are
made are always protected by earth and
heavy wooden embankments to break the
force and concussion in the event of acci
dent.
According to the rules of the company
an inspection of the works had been made
this morning. The report that everything
was in good running order had hardly
reached the San Francisco headquarters
before the shock of the explosion waa
felt. Secretary Julius Sontag repaired at
once to the works to take charge of tho
investigation which was immediately set
on foot. George Phillips and lymls Leav
ltt were in temporary charge of the works
during the absence of Superintendent
Frank Roller. Neither of the men in
charge could furnish any clew to the solu
tion of the mystery of the explosion.
This Is the first explosion at the works
Flnce they were removed from Flemings
Point, a locality several miles nearer
Oakland. HafTelmeier was one ofr the old
est employes of the powder company and
waa considered particularly competent.
His department was one which required
not only skill, but the greatest caution in
handling the dangerous elements of the
compound.
Haffelmeier leaves a wife and a child 3
years of age. Their home was at a small
settlement near the works, where many of
the company's employes reside.
Beyond the destruction of the mixing
house and Its contents no other damage
was done to thn buildings on the grounds.
The wrecked structure. -the machinery and
the gelatine which exploded are valued at
about J5000. The explosion will cause a
temporary setback, but the company will
at once put up another building and will
Install the necessary machinery to resume
operations speedily in the gelatine depart
ment.
Those of the remains that could bo
recovered were gathered toKether and
taken in charge by Coroner Curry of
Contra Costa County.
There was a rush of workmen to the
scene, but a quick inspection showed that
the unfortunate occupants of the place
had been blown to atoms. There was
hardly a vestige of the building left, let
alone anything recognizable of th^e- bodies
of the three men who had perished.
The two Chinese and Haffelmeier had
been at work for several hours before the
explosion in the building that was de
stroyed. They were attending to the or
dinary routine of their work over the mix
ing tanks in which the dangerous fluid is
prepared. The principal component of the
gelatine is nltro-glycerine, and this power
ful explosive la used in a proportion of al
most GO per cent.
The first intimation other workmen on
the grounds had of the trouble was the
roar of the explosion. Then the cloud
of dust and splinters and then the settling
of the debris told the story of the dis
aster.
The accident occurred a few minutes
after 1Q o'clock. The scene -was at the
isolated house, where the gelatine, the
highest explosive manufactured at the
works. Is prepared for final treatment be
fore it is commercially complete. As is
customary in order to insure reasonable
safety to other buildings, the gelatine
house was located far from the other
structures on the grounds, and further
protection was given the works by the
high bluff, into the side of which a shelf
was dug. Here the structure, a one-story
affair 30 by 50 feet, stood.

T070 Kisen Kaisha's Mail Boat
Leaves for the Orient.
There was not a big crowd down to see
the Toyo Kisen Kaicha's steamer Hong
kong Maru sail for, the Orient yesterday
The mail boat, did not carry any passen
gers, but was loaded down with freight.
About 150 Chinese went away in the steer
age, while a few through passengers went
to Honolulu; but the list for other ports
was light. Those who went away in the
cabin are:
For Yokohamaâ Otto W. Helm, C. Koike, R.
Lyons, K. Nambu, S. Sakural. the Rev. J.
Soper, Mrs. J. Sopor, the Rev. E. R. Woofl
man, Mrs. E. It. Woodman, H. J. Woodman,
Miss M. Woodman and AV. A. Wilson.

Kobayashl.
Nagasakiâ Carl Francke, the Rev. A. E.
RlKby, A. T. Short and Mrs. A. T. Short.
The principal sea arrival yesterday tv^s
the Kosmos liner Isis. She cornes from
Hamburg:, via the Straits of Magellan and
Smith and Central America, and carries
a small cargo, but a large passenger list.
The fight between the Santa Fe and the
Southern Pacific is now on and both lines
will suffer for months to come. Incident
ally the result of the contest may mean
the dropping of San Diegro from the
Kosmos line's ports of call and all the
freight from Europe and So-uth America
bound for the East will be shipped from
this port.
This is the first trip of the Isis to this
port. She differs very little from the
other vessels of the line and has proved
herself to be a good carrier and a good
sea boat.
Jack W. Galbraith, one of the passen
gers, is a well-known mining man. He
went from California to Peru to super
intend a mine owned by wealthy Amer
icans. The property Is the Santo Domino
mine, situated about 500, miles from Mol
lendo. According to Galbraith. the mine
Is wonderfully rich, but the c6st of de
veloping will be very heavy.

INSANE Â¦ SOLDIERS LEAVE "
FOB "WASHINGTON
LEADING SINGERS IN THE CAST OF "TANNHAUSER." WAGNER'S
GREAT MASTERPIECE. PRESENTED IN MAGNIFICENT MANNER
AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE LAST NIGHT.
criticisms of "Tannhauser": Mendels
sohn's gentle narcasm and faint praise of
the new Wagner; Spohr's objection to his
"lack of definite rhythms and rounded pe
riods." "his ugly-attacks on the ear": the
cabals of Paris against, the mad German;
the mild capelimelster's inquiries as to
why Wagner could not have made "Tann
hauser" marry Elizabeth, and so on.
Strangely enough; in our ears this sounds
now. with the broad, simple, limpid clar-
ed with an admirab!e\savolr falre. The
supers ran swiftiy to cover and the or
chestra went on with the most beautiful
overture as if nothing had happened. The
coryphees posed on the tips of their toes
until tired, then gracefully reclined in ap
proved coryphee fashion until their cue
came. And Van Dyck and Miss Susan
Strong slept peacefully under â¢ the roses
through it all.
lty of the Wagner we know so well be
fore us, yet there are stHl those who pre
fer the old Italian school, and to the ex
clusion of the new order of opera. But It
was a Wagner audience last night at the
Grand Opera-house, and. like most Wag
ner houses, ' eminently discreet ln ap
plause, though it roused to unwonted en
thusiasm occasionally.
Gadskl we hove heard before, with her
silver throat and exquisite method. She
is at her best in Elizabeth â acts the part
in a graceful, timple fashion, looks the
royal Teuton maid with acclaim and sings
in, velvet voice the sustained periods of
her part. She received the tribute, of ab
solute silence after her exquisite rendering
of the famous prayer of Elizabeth. . The
venus of the evening, Susan Strong, has
a full, round voice of mellow quality, ex
ceedingly well used, and she pleased much
by her reading of the role. Mme. Olitzka,
who sings the important little part of the
shepherd boy in the flrst act, is also a
capable artist, and gave her alternate
"pipe" and song with excellent effect. -
As to the Tannhauserâ Ernest Van
I>ycK, great among Wagnerian tenors and
new here to us, to our considerable mis
fortune, is an admirable artistâ a splen
did actor, with a suave, strong, sweet,
tenor voice used in exquisite fashion, and
of a personable, graceful figure. His
conception of the recreant knight is un
questionably, unreservedly splendid, and
as such it was appreciated by last night's
audience. .
David Bispham has the Wolfram role,
and this favorite of last season was
heartily welcomed on this his second ap
pearance ln San Francisco.
Mr. Blspham's tine barytone is in good
shape, except for a slight husklness
wnich was apparent occasionally, and his
Wolfram was all that might be expected
from this finished and conscientious ar
tist. The part of Herman was finely sung
by Mr. Blass, who has an excellent basso
profundo voice. Mr. Jacques Bars, Mr.
Hubbenet, Mr. Muhlmann and Mr. Vivi
ani all* sang well their minor . parts.
The mlse-en-scene was perfect, the cos
tumes and scenery picturesque, splendid
and sufficient, and the large chorus above
criticism". ...
A special announcement is made by the
opera, .management of a "popular â¢ night"
to be given next Sunday evening, when
"II Trovatore." with Nordica, Van Caute
ren, Olitzka, Campanari, Journet, Maslero
and Dippel will be put on. and at prices to
suit all pockets.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.

The Tivoli.
' Collamarlnl gave her admirers another
sample of her rare art when she appeared
at the Tlvoli last evening as Mlgnon In
Ambroise Thomas' opera of the same
name. "Mignon" Is as different from
"Carmen" as it is possible for one char
acter to differ from another; still Col
lamarinl adapts herself to the require
ments of the waif heroine with the same
easy grace whicn made her Carmen the
thing of Joy it was. The artiste was m
fine -voice, and her support was "excellent.
Repetto made a- splendid Flllna, and
she gave the scintillating polonaise with a
wonderful brilliancy ana dash. Russo
was at his best as Wilhelm Melster. and
Nicolini found himself happily cast as
Lothario.
"Mlgnon" will be repeated on Thursday
evening. To-night "Ernanl," with Bar
bareschi, Castellano and Nlcollni in the
cast.

' a .contest of-ther will -of ' the late
Sadie Mulvany- Valentine, "also known as
Sadie A. Mulvany, SaraVMulvany, Sarah
Mulvany, Sadie Valentine and Mrs. C. O
Valentine," was filed yesterday, by C. G
Valentine, decedent's husband. 1 - In -the
contest it is alleged that the \ deceased
jit the time the will was executed. Sep
tember 21, 1899," was not. of sound mind,
but at frequent intervals was an Inmate
of : asylums and hospitals, forsthe treat
ment of chronic alchollsm and thÂ«Â» de
mentia and mental .aberration that re
sult therefrom. - - , * .
The contestant further charges that hla
deceased wife was unduly influencedby
Floyd J. Nutting,- Jessie A; McCall and
Oscar J. Mayer. In conclusion the con- 1
testant prays that the will be denied ad
mission to probate, and declares that he
is her sole heir at law and -therefore en
titled to letters of - administration.. ' upon :
decedent's estate. . ' â¢
, .Valentine also filed a claim against his
wife's estate fpr $2400,. which sum-he al

ficlaries took the deceased into their homo
when- she was a tiny child and cared -for
her as though she was their own until
she grew to womanhood. Decedent only
left the "home of her benefactors when
she married a well-known Eastern horse
man, a Mr. Mulvany. Her second ( mar
riage was to Mr. Valentine,* and was>sol
emnlzed at San Diego in 1897. â¢ In Septem
ber of s last year Airs. Valentine â¢ died Â» at
the French Hospital in this- city. While
there she made her will* and named rOs
car J. Mayer as executor. . â¢.,Â»
Valentine, has- reached. vthe conclusion
that his disinheritance '. by.. :his' wife Â»re
sulted from the influence of interested

anced, with the result stated." .
Within the next few days almost three
quarters" of a million dollars of tax money

this city and county, and also the State
of California. The- total -tax. amounts. to
$371,461, . and the first installment of $334,
â¬09 is â¢ now ready for payment -and 'will

CHILD CRUSHED
UNDER WHEELS
E. B. Beeman , of ; chewing gum fame,
whose bald head, or rather a striking like
ness of it, is plastered on billboards,
fences and telegraph poles from Maine to
the Pacific Coast, arrived in town, last
evening and registered at the Palaco.
After affixing his autograph to the hotel
book, an autograph that looked for all the
world like a streak of lightning, the man
who has made millions from the sale of
bis jaw-exercising material left Instruc
tions \with the clerk to be allowed to rest
late on the morrow for he had spent six
days and nights on the train and accord
ing to his own confession was "tired clean
through." . .
A reporter met him as he started for
the elevator.
"You are a devotee of gum-chewing, of
course?" Beeman was asked.
"O, sure! I Â¦ was formerly a.. victim of
the worst kind of indigestion. Look at
me now," and as he spoke his chest ex
panded until It seemed as if his coat but
tons must give way. "The ostriches get
off the track when I roll along."
"Do Californians chew much gum? he
went on. "Well, I should say they did.
We opened a branch factory on the coast
last year and what do you think the re
ceipts from our coast sales amounted to?
Just $120,000 a year. The Beeman factories
are turning out three tons of gum a day.
Our company belongs to the gum trust
now and the six concerns in the combine
manufacture about ten tons a day.
"When pepsin gum was first placed on
the market ten years ago the W. C. T. U.
wouldn't even look at our advertisement.
But after we had convinced them that
the sale of our composition had cut aft
the use of chewing tobacco 50 per cent we
had them all passing resolutions Indorsing
our product."
Since the trust was formed, something
over a year ago, dividends of 17 per cent
on common stock and 7. per cent on pre
ferred stock have been declared. The
trust is capitalized at J9.000.000. Mr. Bee
man expects to be in the city a week or
two after which he will spend a month in
Los Angeles.. His trip to the coast Is
purely for pleasure. Mr. Beeman said:'
"It will be just eleven years the 13th day
of next month that the. first stick of pep
sin gum was made. I was practicing med
icine at the time and as a side issue ran
a pepsin manufactory. One day while I
was dictating a letter my stenographer,*
Miss Nellie Horton. interrupted abruptly
and wanted to know why I didn't mix
pepsin with gum and thereby increase the
sale of the pepsin.
"It. was a capital idea and without wait
ing to finish the letter I sent Miss Horton
after half a dozen packages of common
chewing gum. We got an oil stove, mixei
the gum and pepsin with some water and
then after the mixture had cooled we un
dertook to chew it. | But it wouldn't chew
I was not discouraged, however, and after
repeated experiments the flrst genul ie
pepsin gum was placed on the market In
February of the following year. Miss
Horton received 15 per cent of the
profits." - .
Beeman Says Californians
Use It in Very Large

The duty of appointing the standing
committees of. the State Senate of th*
next Legislature will devolve upon Lieu
tenant Governor Jacob H. Neff. Accord
ing to his ideas of fair representation
there should be at least one Democrat
on each committee, but of the holdover
Senators 'only five are Democrats. The
only Democratic Senator elect is Joseph
M. Plunkett of the Seventeenth District
of San Francisco. Six Democrats there
fore comprise the strength of the party
in the upper branch of the Legislature.
If there be thirty-four standing commit
tees, a number sufficient to give a chair
manship to each Senator of the majority,
each Senator of the minority may be
obliged to serve on at least five commit
tees. The Lieutenant Governor would
find the v work of adjusting the committees
somewhat easy, if he had a few moro
Democrats to fill in with.
The holdover Republican Senators are:
James T. Laird, Dr. W. F. Maggard,
William M. Cutter, John F. Davis, Dr.
Chester Rowell, John A. Hoey. Frank W.
Burnett. Sig M. Bettman. Frank "W.
Leavitt, E. K. Taylor, Charles M. Short
ridge, 8." C. Smith, C. M. Simpson, A. T.
Currier, A. E. Nuttâ 15.
The holdover Democratic Senators are:
J. W. Goad. JVC. Sims. J. B. Curtin, It.
Porter Ashe, H. L. Paceâ 5.
The Republican Senators elect are:
T. H. Selvage, John R. Tyrrell. W. B.
Lardner, Robert Corlett, J. J: Luchsinger,
C. M. Belshaw, Robert T. L>evlin. A. E.
Muenter, John G. Tyrrell, E. I. Wolfo,
Richard M. Welch, John xi. Nelson. G. R.
Lukens, James D. Byrnes, Louis O'Neal.
Thomas Flint Jr.. C. B. Greenwell. Fred
M. Smith, A. A. Caldwellâ 19.
The single Democratic Senator-elect is
Joseph M. Plunkett.
The official count In the Fifth Senato
rial District may turn the scale against
W. B. Lardner, but advices from Placer
and El Dorado counties are- to the ef
fect that Mr. Lardner is a. winner by a
slender majority.
There Is much gossip concerning chair
manships. John F. Davis of Amador,'
who held the second place on the Senate
Judiciary Committee in the last Legisla
ture, will doubtless be promoted to chair
man, as Senator Gillette of Humboldt,
who held first place in the last session,
was not a candidate for re-election to the
Legislature.
Common report is to the effect that Sen
ator Cutter of Yuba will be appointed
chairman of the Senate Committee on Ap
portionment: Twenty 'different bills to ap
portion the State into Congressional, Sen
atorial and Assembly districts have been
prepared. Should the national reappor
tionment give California eight Represent
atives in Congress the plans already
mapped out would Have to undergo read
justment or provision be made for electing
one Congressman at large. The appor
tionment scheme prepared by Senator
Cutter is not acceptable to Congressman
Metcalf and other leading men of Ala
meda County.
Senator S. C. Smith of Kern County i3
in line for the chairmanship of the Finance
Committee. Service on the committee for
three consecutive sessions of the Senate
is supposed to count for something. He
was slated for the first place on the
Finance Committee at the beginning of
the session of 1899, but at the eleventh
hour. the slate was mysteriously changed.
Charles M. Belshaw, who has made a
record in the Assembly for economy in the
disbursement of public funds, Is spoken
of as one who could render the State ex
cellent service as chairman of the Senate
Committee on Claims. ;
It is conjectured that either Mr. Lard
ner of Placer or Mr. Tyrrell of Nevada
will be appointed chairman of the Senate
Committee on Mines and Mining.
Thomas Flint Jr. will be re-elected pres
ident pro tem. of the Senate. His ability
as a presiding officer is universally recog
nized. Frank Brandon will doubtless be
again chosen secretary of the Senate.
It seems to be settled beyond all doubt
that Alden Anderson of Solano will be
re-elected to the position of Speaker of
the Assembly. He served in that office
to the satisfaction of both parties during
the greater . part of the regular session
and throughout the extra- session of the
last Legislature. C. "W. Pendleton of
Los Angeles Is spoken for as an aspirant
for the Speakershlp, but' he seems to.be
the only one that regards his candidacy
as a serious proposition.
F. E. Dunlap, who was recognized in
the last session as one of the leaders of
the Assembly, will doubtless be placed at
the head of the Committee on Rules.- Â¦â¢ â¢
W. S. Mellck is an applicant for the
chairmanship of the Ways and Means
Committee. He has served on the com
mittee throughout three sessions of the
Legislature. * W. C. Ralston desires to
serve as chairman of the Assembly Com
mittee on Mines and jMlning. . ;.
j According' to the semi-official count
sixty-five of the â¢ eighty Assemblymen
elect are Republicans; The patronage: of
the House consists of ninety-eight places.
There is one position at $8 per day. There
are fourteen places at $6 per day; four
teen at $5 a day; forty-two at $4 per day;
twenty at $3 per. day and seven at $2 50
per day. Of course, there will be the
usual scramble for the spoils and the
usual effort of the hoggish legislator to
get more than his 6hare. Â¦ '
A contest for the chairmanship of the
San â¢ Francisco delegation is in progress.
Arthur G. Fisk, Assemblyman-elect.
Thirty-seventh District, who ran 900
ahead of his . ticket and received 1400 ma
jority, is supportedby many members of
the city delegation. Martin Kelly is
booming the candidacy of Martin Brady
of the Forty-third District. Â¦
The Alameda County delegation will
hold an early .meeting to organize. It -is
presumed that one of the holdover Sena
tors will be elected chairman.* The hold
overs are E. K. Taylor, and Frank W.
Leavitt.
Appears to Be Settled That Alden
Anderson Will Be Re-elected

Assembly.

audience last night.
But the unexpected situation was accept-
One has heard the "Tannhauser" over

it was given last night. It was like a
great flower of music, opening ever Into
a greater griory of color, texture, tone; a
rich arabesque, its line and pattern ever
changing with the shifting lights of the
orchestration. And so it was throughout
with the orchestral work, in Its accompa

symphonic intermezzos. There is the
nicest balance in the orchestral make-up â
woodwind, brass, strings, all in their per

most complete discretion, phrasing, into
