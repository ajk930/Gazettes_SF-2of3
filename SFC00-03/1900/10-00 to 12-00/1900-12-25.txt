Crowe first appeared as a star in crimi

Omaha. He operated with 'a lot of sneak

"snatcher," but the boldest one of them
all. For two years he was a leader in

OMAHA, Dec 24.â The only develop
ment in the Cudahy kidnaping
case*to-day was the finding of
the lantern with which Mr.
Cudahy *. was" flagged on his
drive Into the country last Wednesday
night, carrying the $25,000 with which to
obtain the return of hlÂ» son, and the dis
covery of other paraphernalia left by the
robbers In their hurry to depart. \ This
confirms again the 6tory of the drive and
assists the police in finding the methods
employed by the bandits.
A man,. the name of whom the police re
fuse to reveal, identified Pat Crowe as the
light-complexloned individual who. In
company with a woman, accosted him In
the vicinity of the robbers' rendezvous
relative to the ownership of the house, to
which young Edward Cudahy Â¦was carried"
by kidnapers last Tuesday night. â¢ -
When shown a picture of Crowe. taken
from the rogues' gallery, this man stated
positively that It was a perfect likeness
of the man he saw at Thirty-sixth and
Grover streets. Questioned closely as to
the man's conduct, dress, manner and
general description, he * gave a detailed
statement which convinced the authorities
that they are on the right track. . "-â¢'
.The Informant says that during his
short talks with the suspect, while nego
tiations were pending for 'the renting of
the house, he made sufficient note of his
personal appearance to be absolutely cer
tain as to the identification.
At a point seven and one-half miles west
of Omaha, on Center street, about a quar
ter of a mile west of Craddock Grove,
on the south Bide of the road, was found
on Thursday morning the lantern, with
the white and black ribbons' attached,
which was used to "flag" Mr. Cudahy in
his drive. It was found by two sons of
a farmer, on their way to school. They
picked up the lantern, supposing it was
left by "movers," who might have
camped. at that point over night. The
lantern was, placed In possession ; of ; a
Constable, who brought It to Omaha this
afternoon. To-day two trousers legs and
an undershirt Bleeve were found buried be
neath the snow near the fence adjoining
the road. The finding of the lantern set
tles beyond all question the exact location
as to the point where the kipnapers re
ceived their ransom. It also gives the
authorities an Important clew.
The trousers legs were Intended for
treasure bags. They are of black Clay
worsted and had been patched. The trou
sers legs were cut off midway between
the knee and the hips. When the lantern
was picked up it was filled with oil, and
the wick showed that it had recently been
used. .
Near where the lantern was found were
a number of ears of corn, a part of the
kernels yet remaining on the cobs, indi
cating that a horse had been fed there
very recently. Tracks were observable In
the soft earth, showing that a horse had
been tied neaÂ» where the lantern "was
found. On the wire fence. was a piece of
common white wrapping twine, which had
evidently held the lantern In place while
being used as a signal to Mr. Cudahy.

fore obliged to make a rebate.
To-morrow being a holiday there will bÂ«
no loading of the Prairie. The cars will
be released by the payment of 500 francs.
Should "Wednesday not bring a satisfact
ory solution Major Brackett will probably
pay the rest of the claim under protest
in order not to delay further the sailing
of the Prairie. At the same time he will
enter an additional claim for damages.
Some trouble also arose with Philip
Lazles, the contractor who built the na
tional pavilion. He wrote to the Ameri
can Commission on December 16, saying
that the last letter from Commissioner
General Peck was not satisfactory and
asking when the building would be turned
over to him for demolition. Two days
later he notified the commission that he
Intended to take possession and begin
destruction Immediately. He In turn was
informed that the building would be
placed under his control December 20. and
at a formal meeting he wes notified that
the' commission would remove certain
furnishings not supplied by him, a propo
sition to which his representative did not
object.
On Saturday night, while the American
custodian of the building, assisted # by
two workmen, was removing material be
longing to the United States a force of.
police arrived and arrested all three on
the ground that they were taking goods
which did not belong to them. It is said
that M. I.azies brought about the arrests.
Major Brackett obtained their release
to-day. M. Lazies served him with a
legal notice that he would not accept the
pavilion In its present shape and. Â¦would
demand damages for delay. The French
man will now be held to the strict terms
of the contract, which Includes demoli
tion, and a counter claim will be entered
of a forfeit of 20O francs daily from March
15. the date when the contract called for
completion, to June 23. together with a
claim of 20C0 francs for defective con
struction, as the roof leaked and certain
furnishings were ruined. More than this,
there will be a special claim of 2000 francs
If it can be proved that M. Lazles brought
about the arrests, making a total of 2G.SC0
francs.
Another bone of contention may be the
settlement of the restaurant concession
In the American pavilion, which has not
been paid for.
"Last summer the company submitted
a bill of 32.7S2 francs for freight charges
against the commission," he said to-day,
"and pressed -for payment. Pending an
explanation of certain items I paid 25.000
francs on account, at the same time ask
ing for details. When these were fur
nished I discovered that the commission
had been charged with 4193 francs which
should have been charged to the Cora
pagnie Generale Transatlantic while
4110 francs should have been charged to
When Major Brackett was informed by
the United States agent at Havre he
wired him Instructions to pay to the com
pany 500 francs in the presence of the
legal authorities and at the same time
to enter a claim against the company for
10,000 francs as damages for obstruction
and delay.
Major Brackett thereupon' endeavored
to obtain a settlement, but without avail.
The matter dragged, along through the
summer, -the secretary of the American
Commission repeatedly expressing his
willingness to settle any Just claim
against the United States. The company
left the case In an unsatisfactory condi
tion, and finally embargoed the cars.
The company bases Its claim on demur
rage charges on freight in the cars when
the goods were brought to the exposition
for installation. Some time ago the claim
was submitted, and Major Brackett, sec
retary of the American Commission, In
vestigated it and concluded that It had
no foundation, as some of the cars
charged against the American Govern
ment never . contained official exhibits,
while the others were cars utilized by pri
vate exhibitors and not therefore charge
able to the United States.
PARIS, Dec. 24.â Thirty cars, forming
part of the United States Government ex
hibit at the recent Paris exposition, were
suddenly laid under embargo to-day at
Havre, the railroad company declining to
surrender them, pending payment of a
claim of 5570 francs. This extraordinary
action, seriously delaying the departure
of the United States auxiliary cruiser
Prairie, from Havre for New York, with
the Government exhibits, was made the
subject of a formal protest to the French
Government by United States Embassa

NEW YORK, Dec. 24.-The Tammany

they would present facts to the Grand

said that places mentioned in the list
given to Chief Deverj* 1 by Chairman Nixon
were closed. The majority of the place*
were gambling dens and disorderly

hours Chairman Nixon gave out the fol

in the Philippines at the town of Cap

two natives were responsible for the death

the woman was possessed of occult pow

had brought about the death of a neigh

ALEXANDER MeKENZIE. THE DEPOSED RECEIVER OF NOME MIN
ING CLAIMS, AGAINST WHOM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES HAS DECIDED.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â As a result of
a conference between the Secretary of
*War and Quartermaster General Ludlng
ton, it has been decided that no further
action can be taken with regard to the
return of the volunteers from the Philip
pines until Congress shall make provision
for their replacement. The War Depart
ment is considerably embarrassed by the
failure of Congress to. make, provision be
fore the recess for the relief of the mili
tary situation In the Philippines. Acting
upon representations made by General
MacArthur. the department has concluded
that it is absolutely necessary to maintain
an army of 60.000 men In the Philippine
Islands until the current policy of estab
lishing municipal governments through
out the archipelago has been executed.
It is stated at the department that with
any reduction of the military strength
below that figure existing conditions would
doubtless prove most disastrous to the In
terests of the United States.
There are now about 69,000 troops, regu
lars and volunteers, in the Philippines,
and arrangements have been already
made for bringing home 9000 of that num
ber. No further reduction will be made
until the War Department is advised fully
of the purpose of Congress Avith regard to
army legislation. When the necessary
authority haa bcÂ«i given it is the purpose
of the department to bring home as rap
idly as possible all the volunteers and reg
ulars whose terms of enlistment expire
on the 30th of June next, but not before
it Is possible to replace them man for
man with recruits enlisted under' the
terms of the new army bill.
It Is expected that Congress will act
promptly on thÂ© army bill soon after it
reassembles In January, but even In that
event It .U said at the War Department
it will not be- possible to get the fresh
troops to the Philippines inside of two
months' time. The general home-coming
movement of the mass of volunteers,
therefore, will have to be postponed until
about February L That will give the
quartermaster's department but five
months' time to bring home thÂ© remainder
of the volunteers and the regular troops
whose terms will expire at the same time,
aggregating about 40,000 men, before July
1. This is Believed to be beyond the capa
city of the transport service as at present
organized and may necessitate the char
tering of additional steamships.
Recent cable advices from General Mac-
Arthur indicate a strong- desire on the
part of the volunteers generally to re
turn to the United States, and that com
paratively few of them are likely to re
enllst unless the most liberal inducements
are offered. It is understood that General
MacArthur - has- recommended that a
bounty of $250 be allowed to each soldier
In the Philippines who. re-enlists for an
other term, and the plan is said to meet
Â¦with the favor of the officials of the War
Department.

LONTDON", Dec. 25.â The Standard, re
ferring to the canal difficulty, expresses
a hope that President McKInley will
'Â¦show himself wiser than the inconsider
ate Senate."
The Daily Chronicle bluntly admits that
the "Nicaragua cloud has become very se
rious." It sc-c-s no compromise course be
tween allowing things to elide, thus "caus
ing another miserable loss. to our honor
end reputation," and an unconditional re
fusal of the new amendments. Assuming
the latter alternative to be adopted, the
Daily Chronicle asks: "\Vht force has
Lord Salisbury to back up a refusal? Our
army is shut up in South Africa and
China, and ourTiavy is needed to protect
communications with both. Seldom in its
Ftcrmy career has the Conservative N gov
t rnment been placed in a most dangerous
dilemma."
WASHINGTON, Dec U.~ The State De
partment has decided to send the amend
ments to the Hay-PauncefotÂ© treaty to
the British Government through two
< hannels. one being transmitted to Lord
J'auncefote, the British EmbaBsador, and
ihe other through Erobassador Choate at :
l^ondon. who will present it to the For
eign Office. It is the understanding that
the department will make no representa
tion whatever as to the changes made in
the treaty; the Senate amendments will
be allowed to epcak for themselves and
the action of the department will be pure
ly formal. As the papers leave New York
on to-morrow's mail steamer, they should
reach London about New Year's day. so
that the negotiations will certainly lapse
over into the next century at the very
earliest.

One Journal Deplores the Fact That
Great Britain Is Not in a Posi

Acquiesce.
The closing of the Holy Door took place
with the. utmost, pomp ...of., the Catnolic
Church, his Holiness descending to St.
Peter's Cathedral; at 11 a.m., and the
ceremonies lasted until l*p..m. The Pope
then returned to his apartments, appar
ently not fatigued. "'He intoned the "Te
Deum" in a resonant voice, and through
out gave evidence of being in excellent
health and .spirits. He used the artistic
golden trowel, subscribed for by the Cath
olics of the world, in mortaring the glided,
bricks which he placed, as a first layer,
on the threshold of St. Peter's door. The
whole pontiticial court participated in the
ceremonies. . ' . . >- ,
The spectacle Inside the^vast basilica
was superb. The pillars of the central
nave were draped with gold embroidered
scarlet cloth, and the porch under which
the function' took place was transformed
into a' magnificently decorated hall. On
the left of the Holy Door was erected the
pontlncial throne, covered with red and
gold. On the right hand of the door stood
tribunes for royal personages,- Princes,
Knights of Malta, prelates, representa
tives of the Roman nobility, and other
distinguished persons.
Inside the church every inch of space
was occupied by the throng which gath
ered early in the morning. A strong de
tachment of troops, stationed in the
square in front of the Cathedral, con
trolled the incoming crowds, who literally
raced to secure the best positions.
- The Pope left his apartments at 11115 a.
m.,' borne in the sacred chair and pre
archbishops, bishops and cardinals, and
ceded by clergy with lighted candles,
archbishops, bishops and cardinals, and
escorted. by the pontificlal noble guards.
On his arrival at the portal of St. Peter's
he alighted and entered, the church
through the Holy Door. As he appeared
on the threshold, the silvery tones of the
trumpet echoed through the edifice. The
chaplain of the Vatican met him and pre
sented to him" holy water, which he
sprinkled upon the congregation. Ap
plause being forbidden, a religious silence
was observed, which heightened the
grandeur and impressiveness of the mo
ment. . . :Â¦ -
Borne now on the Sedia Gestatoria to
the high altar, he stepped to the ground
and kneit before the most precious relics
of the Catholic Church,, which wer# dis
played on the altar. Then the procession
reformed and proceeded to the chapel of
the Sacrament, where the Pontiff again
knelt for some time, while the choir of
the Sistine chapel chanted psalms. The
Pope was then borne to the Holy Door,
where he alighted from the Sedia Gesta
toria and waited until the entire proces
sion had passed out through the door, he
leaving the church last and walking to
the throne,- where he seated himself. A
number of sacred songs were sung by the
Papal choir, after which Leo rose and
blessed all the material employed in clos
ing the door.
â¢ Then he descended frctei the. throne,
knelt before the dome and* laid with the
gold trowel a layer of cement, on which
he placed three gilt bricks bearing com
memorative inscriptions. Beside 'the
bricks, he placed a casket containing gold,
silver and bronze medals and bearing the
head of Leo, and inscriptions recording
the opening and closing of the Holy
Door. ". â¢ Â¦ â¢
The Pope having ascended the throne.
Cardinal Bishop Scran" no Vannutelll,
great plenipotentiary, and four other car
dinals, performed a similar ceremony . of
laying cement and three bricks, after
which the masons employed by the Vati
can closed the doorway with a canvass
screen, painted to represent marble, with
a cross in the center.
The candles borne by the clergy 'were
extinguished, the "Te Deum" was sung
and the Pontiff, having given solemn ben
ediction, was immediately carried back
to his apartments.
It is estimated that 80,000 people were
spectators of the ceremony.
ROME, Dec. 24.â The Pope to-day per
formed the ceremony of closing the holy
door of St.; Peter's. Cathedral with the'
gorgeous forms usual "to great functions
of this kind. It was a. magnificent (spec

President Bond lays the stagnation of
the market to the law of supply and de
mand. He does not favor a reduction m
prices or a differential on large orders.
He says the association is doing the best
it can, but any time the great body 'of
growers are dissatisfied the management
Is willing to resign and let others take
their places.
The Farmers'- Club and Grange have
passed resolutions endorsing President
Bond's action and favor holding up prices,
believing that the association will work
out all right. â¢
SAX JOSE, Dec. 24.â Tho dissatisfaction
which has assumed a threatening shape
in the California Cured Fruit Association
took shape at a meeting of fruit growers
to-day which may result In. the retire
ment of President Bond. His policy was
severely scored, and while no definite
action was taken the sentiment of tho
meeting was decidedly adverse to the
present policy of the ' association. An
other meeting will be helu next Monday.
Some predict that before that time tne
president will change his policy.
The stagnation ot the prune market
seems to be the cause of the trouble, and
this some of the growers blame to the
prices set by the association, which are
claimed to bo too high. These prices it ia
alleged antagonized the middlemen of the
Kast that have combined to prevent the
sale of the fruit. ; The prune crop this
year was about 125,000,OCKt pounds, and
enly about 31,000,000 pounds have been sola
by the association, realizing about $"00,OJ0.
This divided among the thousands of
fruit growers gives a small sum to each.
Growers outside the association have dis
posed of their fruit and received their
money. They held about 15,000,000 pounds
of prunes.
Now some of the growers are In need
of money and cannot get It. Their .re
ceipts, which wero supposed to â¢ beÂ» of
gilt edge security, are not readily received
by the banks, and only small loans can
be secured on them. These growers now
tavor the offering of differentials to buy
ers of large lots or a reduction of the
basis price of the four sizes one cent a
pound.
While the dissatisfaction has not . yet
assumed a serious shape, it is believed It
will spread. Some of the discontented
ones even go so far as to want the resig
nation of President Bond demanded and
more experienced men put in charge.

Both Mr. Oldham and his wife are deaf
and dumb and both are from prominent
families. He has been a searcher of rec
ords in this city for twelve years and has
always been highly esteemed.
He is a brother-in-law of County Sur
veyor N. V<-4'. Smythe and has relatives
living in Oakland. Mrs. Oldham's folks
live In Ukiah; >__
It seems Mr. Oldham met a relative of
his wife at the Donahue depot on Sunday
morning to get some presents the rela
tive had for his baby boy. Mr. Oldham
did not return home until late In the
afternoon, when his wife asked him
Â¦where he had been and why he hft<l
stayed so long. He attacked her, throw
ing her down and dragging her around
in his attempt to choke her. He then told
her he would shoot her and went to get
his pistol. Mrs. Oldham then left the
house and went to a neighbor's, where eht;
told her story. A telephone message to
the police station brought officers, who
had quite a tight with Mr. Oldham before
he was subdued. It is thought by. all h!s
friends that Mr. Oldham Is suffering from
a mental strain for the time, which has
unbalanced his mind.

The court is asked to determine Dun
lap's indebtedness and force its collection.
Plaintiffs declare that by such agree
ment of directors, and by arbitrary, un
reasonable and deliberate ruling of Presi
dent Rea. the bank has been prevented
from obtaining- ruch sums due ft and al
ways will be prevented.
The complaint states that the organized
depositors on November 7. 1S99. obtained a
Judgment cjrainst the bank for J354.SS2,
and only J13S.7C2 has= been paid on the
same. An execution for the balance unse
cured was returned by the Sheriff with
the information that he could find no as
fet? to levy on. It is alleged the assets of
the bank are insufficient to pay more than
40 per cent of the claims of plaintiffs and
others.
It is stated that President Rea boasts
he controls the board and will prevent the
collection of such indebtedness, and that
the directors have refused to take any ac
tion to collect It.
When the bank closed nearly two years
ego Dunlap owed the bank $300 on one
promissory note and a balance of 55S3 34
on another note, and both were long over
due. The complaint recites that President
Rea was also indebted to the bank $5000,
and Director William Simpson $2000.
About a year ago Director Cyrus Jones,
who was then on the board, made a mo
rion that the bank officials be compelled to
pay up their indebtedness. The motion
â¢was seconded, but President Rea declared
it out of order.

HftW tf\ Find C^llt Ic uscd tÂ° â¢>Â¦ considered that only urinary
nu " lU r lllu wul and bladder troubles were to be traced to the
I* YniJ l\!f*Â£fcH kidneys, but new modern science proves that
Â¦ 1 8 lÂ»U IMCCU nearly all diseases have tneir beginning in tha
SW/imnaRnnt disorder of these most important organs.
- V?wamp HUUl. The kidneys filter and purify the blood-that
is their work. So when your kidneys are weaK or out of order you can under-
stand how quickly your entire body Is affected, and how every organ seems to fail to
do Its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking the famous new discovery. Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all tha
other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not
correctly understood. They are led to believe that womb trouble or female weak-
ness of some sort Is responsible for the manv ills that beset womankind.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache In the back, weakness or bearing down sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to pass it
night or day. with scalding or burning sensation â these are all unmistakable signs
of kidney and bladder trouble.
, If there is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place It in a glass or bottle and let it stand twenty-four
hours. If on examination It Is milky or cloudy, if there Is a brickdust settling, or
if small particles float about in it. your kidneys are In need of immediate attention.
Other symptoms showing that you need Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizziness.
Irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambition
but no strength.
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to take and Is used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians in their private practice, and is taken by doctors themselves.
because they recognize In It the greatest and most successful remedy that scienca
has ever been able to compound.
If you aro already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, you can pur-
chase the regular flfty-cent and one-dollar bottles at the drug stores everywhere.
EDITORIAL NOTICEâ Swamp-Root, the great Kidney. Liver and
Bladder remedy, is bo remarkably successful that a special arrangement has been
made by which all of our readers who have not already tried It may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mall. Also a book telling all about kidney and

Italian residents were at - a Christmas
dance last. evening. At 2 o'clock this
morning a young woman who accompa
nied Vlto Naraglanoto the dance refused
to become partner for a waltz with Anton
Dori. The rejected fellow became angered
and followed Naraglano and the young
woman about the lioor.. making remarks
about them. Naraglano became angry
and replied and Dori then challenged him
to a duel. The challenge was accepted
and the men started outside to fight it
out. The dancers all left the floor and
went out to see what would happen.
Dori was armed with a stiletto and Na
raglano with a revolver. Dori began the*
attack at once and plunged his knife into
his opponent's chest a little below the
heart, inflicting a serious wound. Nara
glano fired two shots at Dori. One went
wild eo far as Dori was concerned, and
the other passed through hU arm. The
bullet which missed Dori hit Musician
Antonio Gluzeppi in the right eye and
passed upward and backward into the
brain. ,
An instant later the entire gathering
was mixed up in a free fight, in which
knivea played an important part. When
it was over two j others were wounded
dangerously. The injured musician died
to-night.

fing all around Mips Dresser. Miss Shat
tuck has two- new- songs, neither of
especial Interest, but she sings them,
without question, in a continually more
competent fashion. Louise 'Dresser is an
extremely fetching young woman and has
with her two clever young darkies. Her
voice is forced, but of pleasant quality
where the production is natural. With a
bright comedy, "Tha Key of C," well pre
sented* by Will Cre?sy and Blanche
Dayne, the notable holiday programme is
completed, and It is eafe to find many
takers.
Tlvoli.
"Cinderella," the holiday attraction
at the Tlvoli, has "caught on," and last
night the -popular resort was crowded.
Everything went smoothly and encores
were frequent. The great "Carmen" bur
lesque is something to be seen and re
membered, and other popular feature?
such as the electric girls, "Sunflower
Sue," "Blushin' Roale," Ida Wyatt in her
specialty and the frolic of the pussies
and the bow-wows were loudly applaud
ed. All the principals, Ferris Hartman,
Edward Webb, Tom Greene, Fred
Kavanagh, Maude Williams, Annie
Myers, Mae Hill and Julie Cotte, seemed
to vie with each other to please the large
CHANGES IN NATIONAL
GUARD MAUKSMAH RULES
Target Practice Under the Old Begii
lations Has Not Given Entire
Satisfaction.
Target practice and regulations for com
pany monthly shoots in the Fifth Regi
ment, >.*. G. C, were greatly altered at
the annual executive meeting of the of
ficers of the regiment held at the Califor
nia Hotel last evening. The newly applied
regulation in regard to ranges of 200, 300
and 500 yards has proven successful, and
with a few changes will remain. Hereto
fore a marksman shot an entire score of
fifteen shots, five at each target. Now he
must accomplish a satisfactory per cent
on the 100-yard target before he is allowed
to shoot at other ranges.
In the medal awards the percentage has
bt en found to be too high, the gold bar
being practically massacred at 90 per cent.
The percentages will be reduced probably
10 per cent.
Heretofore there have been twelve com
pany shoots a year and the marksman's
standing was taken from the nine high
est. During the winter months much dif
flculty, waa encountered in holding shoots,
so that hereafter nine shoots only will
be held. The officials are making an ef
fort to secure Krag-Jorgenson rifles and
the appointment of Sergeant Boynton of
San Rafael as inspector of rifle practice
in the regiment is a step toward this ac
complishment, as Boynton Is one of the
most earnest advocates of the new, rifle.
Boynton has been appointed, but not com
missioned. . -
The recent Inspection In the Fifth show
ed the regiment very weak in Its corps
of non-commlssloned officers, and to more
closely watch this department the officers
decided to hold Inspections of non-com
mlssloned officers seml-annually. The field
staff came In for a "roast" at the annual
meeting and a reconstruction will be made
in this division. -
It was decided that the regiment should
hold a two weeks' encampment, probably
at Santa Cruz. The camp will be held
not later than June, 1901, as at the end of
that month the State appropriation ex
pires.

HABEAS CORPUS CASES
ARE TO BE EXPEDITED
Andreas Saxlehner oÂ£ Budapest. Hungary, the
late proprietor of the springs which yield tha
well-known Hunyadl Janos Natural Aperient
Water, Introduced this water Into the markets
of our American continent thirty yeara ago,
and ever since Mr. Saxlehner's death his widow,
Mrs. Emile Saxlehner, has been continuing the
business.
â¢ This natural water became a favorite wllh
the medical men, as well as with the consuming
public.
The sweeping victory of this natural water
over other aperients Induced competitors to
make use of the great reputation ot Hunyaill
Janos, and the Eisner & Mendelson Company
of New York found It a profitable business to
put U"on the market of the United- States a
water" In a style of bottles and with labels
closely Imitating the bottle and label of the
genuine Hunyadl Janos water.
About four years ago Mrs. Saxlehner dis
covering the unfair competition, brought eult
against the Eisner & Mendelson Company. This
suit came to an end In the Supreme Court of
the United States In October laet by a decis
ion of that court, by which tho Eisner & Men
delson Company was ordered to stop the using
of ouch Imitation bottles and labels and to pay
over to Mrs. Saxlehner all the profits which
they had made by the eales of the Imitation
since the Inception of their business.
The public will hereafter be safe In getting
the genuine Hunyadl Janos Water, especially
If It will take the trouble to observe that the
bottle bears the well-known blue label with
red center panel and the full name, Hunyadl
Janos.
Probably there are but few cases described In
the annals of courts'of Justice In which we can
read of eueh an extensive Imitation of labels
as In the case ot Saxlehner vs. the Eisner <fc
Mendelson Company of New York.

Important Change in Trains.
1 Their permanent home is in the At
lantic, between Land's End and the coast
of France, but with the summer a long
ing for change, new scenes, new excite
ments, comes over the pilchard, even
as it fills the Jaded city man, and so he
packs up and quits, and when the young
Breton 1 is supplying Peneau with young
pilchards caught in. the Bay of Biscay,
shoals numbering tens of thousands are
swarming up our Cornish coasts, and
from Plymouth to St. Ives the stalwart
sons of . the duchy are hard at work,
spreading their nets and tossing nightly
upon the dark deep for the sake of the
'market value of the fish. They "hike"
them in in thousands,.but can never catch
too many,- for no man knows what to do
with a pilchard better than a Cornishman.
He kippers them, salts them, marinatts
them for his Sunday morning breakfast,
follows the lead of the Frenchman, and
turns them into' sardines, packs â¢ them
into barrels and sends them oft to Italy,
bolls, them fresh, fries them fresh, and,
a great point, eats them often fresh with
cream. His confreres use them to bait
their handllnes and splllers. and, in fact,
a West Country fisherman finds a pil
chard comes In pretty handy "inside and
out," as the American said.
In days of the past fish were only salted,
squeezed, packed and hampered off to
Italy to feed the fasting Catholics, and at
that time St. .Ives was the chief center,
but nowadays sardining has divided
honors with the transportation business,
and at Mevagissey and Newlyn factories
are turning out the little square tix boxes
as fast as they know how, and yet the
cry of the buyer is: Â¦ "Faster! More! "We
can sell 'cm if you'll let us have them."
So the drifters work" nightly and the fac
tory hands toll daily, and it is good for
the people. *.*, â¢ . *
The method is this. When the sun be
gins to set. out go the luggers from every
port between tne Rame at Plymouth and
tho island at St. Ives; fleets numbering
.forty. to: fifty. sail even at the small ports,
and when Old Sol has been turned out for
the night overboard ' go the * nets, a mile
long and- four fathoms deep beneath the
surface, kept from sinking by cork buoys.
Then down go : the brown sai.s, . and the
luggers drift with the long walls of net till
the small hours of the morning. : when the
capstan is manned and the nets hauled in.
With them safe aboard homewaru go the

When the average Englishman feels
that a taste of sardine is necessary for
the purpose of enjoying life, unless he
can get Peneau's "Sardines In Oil" he
feels mortified, and assures himself with
a conviction born of despair that those in
his possession are not sardines. So far
he is right, but he makes a general mis
cake when he explanls loftily to his do
mestic circle: "No, they are not sar

so that what we generally have foisted
upon us are sprats."

Is no fish called a sardine, any more than
there Is a fish called a bloater. In both
cases the name is only applied subsequent
to their having been cured, and the
name of every fresh sardine is pilchard, t

with salt and water In stone tanks five

EDITOR OF THE CAL.L,: So much has been said of late about the necessity of
the Government making large reservations of the timber lands on the mountains for
the preservation of the water supply for the valleys that I desire to say a few
worfis on that most Important subject through the columns of your paper. I have
lived forty years in the Sierra Nevada mountains and have observed many things
relating to the matter of water supply which enable me clearly to know that the
rnuch-ta!ked-of necessity of preserving the timber to save the water supply Is a
huge mistake; that no such necessity exists. It is not the timber which keeps
the snow on the ground; on the contrary, the timber melts the snow off by its
own natural warmth. It Is an easily demonstrated' fact that In winter where the
timber is the heaviest the greatest degree of warmth exists. Go on the mountains
In the epring when the snow is melting: off and the most casual observation will
reveal the fact that .the trees are not only naked of snow but that a large space
around the butt of each tree Is also naked, and that every log lying on the ground
will be uncovered of enow while huge drifts are plied up between them and away
from the bodies of the standing trees. And It is easily to be seen that the great
storehouses where that snow is piled up in winter which furnishes our water sup-
Fly In summer are found among the rough crags and peaks of the high moun
tain tops, where there is little or no timber, and where what timber there is has
no value whatever for lumbering purposes, for the reasons that the roughness of
the locality renders it impossible or impracticable to get to it. and it is of such
Inferior quality as to be of no value should you be able to reach it.
The people of Northern California have only to look up to our. grand old
Shasta to see that the huge drifts of eternal enow look down upon them from
above the timber line, while the great forests around its base are not only desti
tute cf snow but present a most balmy and delightful atmosphere. And so it Is
through ail of the mountains; Just as soon as you get down to these bodies of tim
ber which are of such a character as to be suitable- for lumbering purposes and
are within reasonable reach of the lumberman's ax, you are out of that snow from
which any summer supply of water is obtained. Take, for Instance, the large and
magnificent bodies cf timber, consisting of sugar pine, red fir, cedar and several
varieties of yellow pine, which lie in the eastern part of Butte and Shasta counties
and in Plumas and Lassen counties, and there are several hundred thousand acres
cf these timber lands lying on broad tablelands easy of access and nearly on a
level with the many beautiful mountain valleys which are surrounded by these
dense forests. When the winter snow is gone from these valleys It Is also gone from
these forests, and good wagon roads are found accesslble'to travel through these
forests as early In the spring as such roads can be found in the valleys; and
th^re is no reason or truth in the statement that these bodies of timber hold back
a supply of water for the valleys In summer. Tet. it Is these vast bodies of tim
ber which are to be set aside as Government reservations, under the mistaken no
tion that the valleys will become deserts for want of water should the lumber
man be permitted to gather in the vast stores of wealth which are embodied in
these timber lands by applying their products to the supply of the wants and neces
sities of mankind.
These forests have been thus placed within easy reach of the lumberman's ax
fnr the wise purpose of adding to the wealth and comfort of man, and the Improve
ment of the world by their use. They were never intended by tho Creator to
f.and forever in Idleness, Just to grow up and then tumble down and rot on the
ground. .But should there be any merit whatever In the claim that this tim
ber protects the water supply for the valleys, the harm contemplated as a result
cf its removal is amply provided against by nature's speedy restoration of the
timber removed. Through all these mountains wherever the timber has been cut
off a new growth immediately springs up with wonderful rapidity, producing a
Jarg<Â» number of young trees for ever}' old one removed. This fact is well known
to every one who has any knowledge of the mountains. And as it would require
many years to remove these vast bodies of timber, it would result that before the
last part could be cut down a new forest, more dense than the old. would have
Â¦jaktn the place of that which had first been removed. Thus, the forest would be
perpetual, even as it is now. for trees, like men, grow old and 'die, and as the old
tree falls and rots on the ground, the young one rushes up to take its place; but
the old one Is lost to the world, while if removed by the lumberman's ax the
old tree supplies a want of man. and the transformation of the forest from the old
to the new becomes more speedy and greatly more beneficial to mankind. Then.
the lumberman's ax does not sweep the forest clean; it Is only the matured or near
ly matured trees which are taken, â¢while the young trees and undergrowth are left,
end these furnish the largest half of the shade and of the snow or water protec
tion, if there Is any such thing. To this add the new growth, and very soon the sald
ui-be protection is greater than under the original conditions.
But there is another condition which should not be lost sight of. Large bod
le's of these timber lands have already been purchased from the Government, and
are now held by individuals. These lands cannot be Included in the contemplated
reservations, and a Government reservation of the lands riot held by Individuals
gives a great monopoly of the available timber to those few Individual holders.
In this day of mighty outcry by the masses of the peopje against monopoly this
great Government Ehould not Indulge In any act which would create bo great a
monopoly in the distribution of those gifts of providence which are intrusted to
â¢ Its keeping for distribution among Its people. And there are many reasons for
believing that this clamor for Government reservations of timber lands Is largely
promoted and pushed forward by those who have timber and Umber lands for sale.
The people of these mountain valleys and mining camps feel that they have an
interest in these grand forests, for they constitute a large share of the wealth of
the country In which we live. This timber is largely required by us In the devel
opment of our mines and in the improvement of our farms and homes, on lands
which we have bought from the Government without timber. Our mining Indus
tries In these mountains are in their infancy. We are Just beginning to realize
that we live in a land of hidden treasures, the great storehouses of which we are
rapidly learning how to unlock; and the timber which surrounds and covers up
our mines is Just as necessary to our future prosperity as are our mines and
homes themselves. These timber lands loom up conspicuously In* all our hopes
and expectations of future prosperity.
We need much of these vast fields of timber here, and the markets of the
Â¦world are calling for their products. The people who live In these mountains and
valleys and mining camps, they who have opened up to the sunlight and to the
world so many of the hidden treasures of these eternal hills, and who have so
largely enriched this country and the world by their energy and Industry and
daring adventures, feel that they have a right to share In the wealth which a proper
use and disposition of these, vast forests will distribute among them; and that
to set these forests apart as a Government reservation, to stand in silent, unused
ldlenef g. just to grow up and then rot down, is to unjustly tie our hands- and to
cripple our industries, and destroy our prosperity and to cut off our best hopes of
good times to come.
In the foregoing lines I know I am expressing the ideas and wishes of every
real live and thoughtful man in all the mountain valleys and mining camps of the
north end of the State, and in their names and interests I most solemnly, pro
test against the contemplated reservations of timber lands by the Government:
and in their names and interests I call the attention of, our members of Congress
to these matters of euch vital Importance to our people, and demand of them
that they see to it that we are not wronged by *uch wholesale slaughter of our
best interests. B- V. SPENCER.

When the case was called Saturday At
torney Schooler, for the defendant, moved
for a r.ew trial on various grounds, but
when court convened yesterday Schooler
asked that his motion be withdrawn,
which was promptly granted. He then
asrked that the defendant should be sent
to San Quentin, but the Judge remarked
that the authorities had requested him
to send the defendant to Folsom. Hoff
â¢was then ordered to stand up and the
Judge imposed the life sentence upon him.
The murderer turned pale as death and
a malignant ecowl overspread his fea
tures which made him look like a demon.
After the Judge had left the bench
Clerk Oscar Tolle said: "Well. Hoff,
have you anything to eay before you
leave us." The muscles of Holt's face
relaxed, and he replied: "1 have to thank
you, Mr. Tolle, for your kindness to me
and have simply to ask that your chil
dren will pray for me. an Innocent man.
I have to thank my attorney. Mr. School

Clute, and some day the truth will come
out. It was another man who killed
her."
Ab he was being handcuffed to another
prisoner. Hoff again burst forth by thank
ing Clerk Tolle. and asking his children
to pray for him. Clerk Tolle smiled, as
he has no children to pray for Hoff.

said the murderer, with, a leer on his
face.
"You swore it was Albert George Fred

To'.le. and Hoff replied: "That f s all right.
You haven't grot my true name yet."
Then he launched into a bitter attack
upon Captain Seymour and ex-Chief Lees.
"They are the ones who put me here,"
he said, as his eyes gave out a baleful
light. "They had to find some one for the
crime and they eald to themselves. 'We

At tho time the accident occurred Mar

Forrest, who was badly intoxicated, was

If the allies could agTee among themselves to open
more doors to commerce in China and take trade ad

But China has no fixed money unit, and the value
of the tael differs in different parts of the empire.
Thus we have the tael of Amoy^ Canton, Chefoo,
Chinkiang, Fuchau, Haikwan, Hankow, Hongkong,
Niuchwang, Ningpo, 1 â¢ Shanghai, Swatow and
Tientsin, differing slightly in value. This difference
runs from a value per tael of .666 Shanghai, the low

China being a silver country, the value of her.taels*
varies with the fluctuations in silver, when expressed
in our coin and standard. As the customs tael is tha:
of Haikwan, it is probable that in all Government
matters that will be used,' so' that when the indemnity
demanded is expressed in taels it will be the one that
is valued at seventy-four cents and two mills in our
money.
In discussing the amount of indemnity the news
dispatches get taels and dollars mixed in a confus
ing way. The tael is a Chinese weight. Its equiva

an expression of weight to be the name of a money
measure is just the same as the use of the pound in
English money, the Hvre in French, and similar deri
vations of the name of money units in other nations.
THE disposition to put upon China a burden she
cannot bear has reappeared among the Minis

science and pride are satisfied by the moderate view3
of our Government- President McKinley takes the
highly just view that indemnity shall not overreach
China's power to respond. He has also given vitality
to the Peace Congress of The Hague by proposing
that the question of indemnity be submitted to the
court of arbitration provided by that body. This
would be productive of much good, for the world and
for China itself.* It would be, in a high sense, her ad
mission to the council of nations in a tribunal where
her equities will receive judicial attention, and it
would also save the self-respect of the people of the
Western powers, who fail to impress their individual
Governments with their own sense of justice. We
hope that some voice that expresses the world's con
scieiice will be lifted in Europe in support of the po
sition of the President of this republic.

It is to be regretted that the present session of Con
gress is too short to take up this subject and discuss
it in all its amplitude. As it is the bill will in all
probability never be so much as introduced and re
ferred to a committee. Even as it is, however, the
originator of the plan will not have his labor in vain.
He has at least obtained a hearing from the press, and
the country has obtained information of his scheme.
It'can hardly.be deemed an issue of practical politics,
but as a forerunner 6f a Populist programme for the
coming century it is worth noting with some interest.
In the first place, at what shade of color are we to
draw the line between the white and the black races?
Is the mulatto, .for example, to be supplied with the
receivable or the redeemable money? In the second
place, how arc we to distinguish between what money
is receivable and what # is redeemable? If the redeem
able money is not to, be received or the receivable
money not to be redeemed, how are we .to maintain
a parity between the finances of the races in the
United States of the Earth? r
It is a twentieth century programme in the fullest
sense of the word. It would take the whole century
to establish it and get it in working order. The is
sue of the money alone would require time and pa
tience, for it appears from reports that come to us
that the proponent of the plan suggests two kinds of
money. He says: "Receivable currency is a white
race idea, while redeemable currency is a black race
idea!" Consequently we must have those two kinds
provided for, and upon deep reflection it will be seen
the task of supplying them will be a difficult one.
The name of this so-called crank is not given. That
fact, while-it may be rn injustice to the individual, is
not to be regretted, since it leaves the country free to
consider his scheme on its merits. It would be, a
public injury to have this far-reaching programme
mixed up with any personality, whether great or
petty. It is big enough to stand alone if it can be
made to stand at all, and when its lofty height is up
lifted any individual perched upon its summit would
be invisible, or, if seen at all, would appear but as a
speck marring the splendor of its crest.

Why cannot these principles be also impressed upon
the policy of Governments, not as dogmas, .not in a
theological or sectarian sense, but in the spirit of
doing right because it is right? If this were done the
Christian nations would be no longer open to re
proach. They would no longer guard against each
ether with great armies. They would no longer com
bine to offer to the wrong and weak terms too hard
to bear. Equity would be the rule, national and inter
national, as it is largely the rule of individual life,
and the people would no longer be better and more
Christian than their Governments, but Governments
would be as good as the people.
Among all systems of religion, morality and ethics,
Christianity stands supremely at the head. In its
text, and letter, and spirit, none is superior to it.
Made the rule of personal and national life, it is ca
pable of producing millennial results. In human so
ciety we -see here and there its benign influence upon
man. Faith, hope and charity go hand in hand
among the miseries of the world to soothe and com
fcrt. The lowly are uplifted, the distressed find com
fort, and wherever brotherhood is made the rule of
conduct life is brighter and better worth living.
The reason why there is such a distance between
Christian faith and the practice of the Christian na
tions must be that their Governments represent the
materialities, the vigorous ambitions, the dynamic
energy, and not the heart and conscience of the
people.
It may well be among the meditations of the sea
son that it is due entirely to the Christian nations that
the twentieth century of the Christian era dawns lurid
with war. If the}' had no armies in the field ther:
Â¦would be peace on earth and good will toward men.
The ancient Egyptians had literature, and libraries
which they reverently called "the dispensaries of the
fcoul." In all the changes and eruptions through
all the dynasties there is no evidence that' books and
libraries were destroyed there. The heathen world
restrained itself in that respect. It was an accident that
destroyed part of the Alexandrian library when Caesar
burned the ships of Antony. The torch was put to the
fleet with no thought of the conflagration spreading
and touching the books. That great collection w4s
left to fall a prey to the Christian zeal of Theodosius.
.If this act have been repeated at Peking, the people
of the nations whose armies and officers are respon
sible should make their protest heard and their hand
felt in punishment of :he atrocity.
But there has entered the world an idea of bi^
brotherhood that gives the strong power to dominate
the fate of the weak, which is at war with the prin
ciple of Christian equality. There are evidences that
the Christian nations, as nations, are as far away
from Christianity as ere the so-called heathen. Re-
Cent and current events in China stand out as wit
r.csses. By the latest information it appears that the
allies have destroyed in. Peking the vast and ancient
libraries, with their collections, that date farther back
than Greece or Rome. It is difficult to associate the
tweet and placid sentiment of Christmas with such an
outrage.
COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.

pride and zeal we go forth on missions of conversion
to other people, while there are grave doubts whether
we are realiy Christians ourselves. The central idea
of our religion is the brotherhood of man, not of
white, black, red and yellow men, with their own kind
tnd color, but of all men with each, and each with

women, but the calm that prevails is suspicious. Perhaps . they, too, are or
genizingr an association to make home happy. There is nothing in the com
mon law that limits a wife to a stick not bigger than her thumb when she
corrects her husband. Therefore, when the men of Monongah actually begin
operations it is not unlikely they may find themselves confronted by deter
mined women armed with pokers, broomsaicks or shovels, equally as resolute
as the men to make home happy. The chances are that the masculine home
makers will be routed at the first onslaught and that they will be contented
with tho old style of happiness at home and have no further desire to try

Such are the latest authentic reports from the scene
where wireless telegraphy is rapidly being perfected
for human use. It is too late now for the nineteenth
century to have the distinction of making extensive
use of the wonderful means of communication, but it
will nevertheless have the right to claim it among the
many marvels of science and mechanism it transmits
tc the centuries that are to come.
The report goes on to say: "Another important
development of the system is the ability to communi
cate over a distance of more than thirty miles by
means of a metal cylinder placed upon an ordinary
chair. This will be of immense advantage in military
operations, for it means that the whole apparatus for
the secret transmission of messages can be conveyed
upon a cart from one point of the field of war to an
other. One great commercial advantage will be that
the great ocean liners, except those that cross the At
lantic will be able to communjeate, at almost any
point of their voyage, with every part of the world.
These latest reports from Marconi himself also an
nounce that the longest distance over which he has
yet succeeded in transmitting messages across water
is ioo miles. That is sufficient to prove beyond all
controversy that the curvature of the earth opposes
absolutely no obstacle to the energy. Of wireless
telegraphy across the Atlantic he is quoted as saying:
"It is merely a possibility of the future. I am not in
the least concerned with that particular problem at
present."
In explanation of his system he is reported to have
stated recently to a representative of the Chronicle:
"Hitherto the ether waves used for wireless tele
graphic messages have been sent in a promiscuous
fashion â that is to say, they could be detected by any
suitable receiver placed anywh'ere within the radius of
action of the transmitting station. â¢ Moreover, if two
stations in proximity happened to send off simul
taneous messages, the receiving station within their
radius would receive both messages, but they would
be jumbled together, and consequently would be un
intelligible. The receiving instruments in my new
system will respond. only to those ether waves to
which they are 'tuned.' The pSssible combinations
of 'tunes' are infinite, and no two instruments, there
fore, can communicate with each other unless they
have first been expressly arranged for such communi
cations. So perfect is the new system that two mes-
S3ges sent off from different stations can be picked
up by one wife, and that one wire, passing through
two receiving instruments, gives to each its proper
message, separate and distinct, and without taking the
other message. In this way it will be possible for
an admiral to communicate at will either with the
whole of his fleet simultaneously or with any particu
lar vessel, and he can do this even if his own fleet
should be split into two squadrons, with a hostile
fleet intervening, and without his signals being under
stood by the enemy."
SWIFTLY through the closing days of the cen
tury Signor Marconi is urging on the work of
perfecting his system of wireless .telegraphy.
His , experiments are being made at Poole Harbor,
England, and are being closely watched and reported
by the London Chronicle. As The Call has hereto
fore announced, his work at present is directed mainly
to completing his method of sending messages which
cannot be read by any receiver except that for
which they are intended, and it appears a high de
gree of success has attended his efforts.

We believe sincerely that crime and immorality
among the lowly and weak of will have their origin to
s. great extent in the unpunished offenses of another
class who owe to the world a good example, but give
a bad example instead. There is no use for the so
cial missionary to go among the ignoble to restrain
and admonish them when they know that the sphere
whence the mission issues is defiled by the practices
which in them are rebuked.
There is no further immunity here for the high
placed and powerful transgressor, who by reason of
his station is more harmful than a thousand humbler
iren who, led by his example, may follow it into
trouble and punishment, while he goes free.
Let it be understood that we profess no zeal to
seek out, detect and expose transgressions in the fu
ture. But when the transgressor exposes himself
by offenses against public decency, he may know
what will happen to him by reading the history of
what has happened.
The hideous vices that have offended by ~ their
gaudy public display, that have smitten innocence,
betrayed trust, broken vows, destroyed confidence and
undermined the most sacred relations, and have
breathed a fetid pestilence where they pranced and
practiced their arts, have been compelled to seek the*

of the power of publicity by the press has banished
them.
We expected to be misunderstood by some, and
therefore criticized. We expected also to be under-
Stood by the class of men we desired to reform by
exposure or to drive their practices into a less hurt
ful obscurity, and therefore to be abused. In neither
case were we disappointed. But we have now the
satisfaction of knowing that those who misunderstood
us offer their compliments to swell the general as
cription of right motive -and good purpose which
comes from all quarters. And we have also the satis
faction of knowing that those who understood and
therefore defamed us have received a'.warning that

We dealt solely with the offensive public and per

stances that would inflict ultimate harm 'of the most
In this we did not, and do not, assume the function
of a censor morum, nor seek to penetrate any proper
privacy to drag its peccadilloes into the light of pub
licity.
Profoundly impressed by a grave sense of duty, The
Call has twice risked greatly in the cause of morality
by exposing those who had every facility for attack
and defense. In each case there was no malice, no
element of personal feeling, nor other sentimenj than
regret that duty to the community required the pur
suit of those whose station and opportunities in life
should have lifted them above practices so vicious
that their continuance meant the inoculation of so
ciety with a social leprosy, the most appalling that can
defile the world.
We have never believed society to be in danger
from the transgressions of those whose station in life
renders them defenseless when exposed. The law
runs quickly to punishment of those whose responsi
bility for social purity is limited by humble or crim
inal surroundings. The press requires no c6urage to
expose them. Steam beer immorality does far less
harm, directly or by example, than the champagne in
decency which so often runs and riots, ruins and be
trays, unscorched by exposure.
The great power of the press is its command' of
publicity. Against that the word of mouth is power
less. If the press make licentious use of publicity it
can easily become a pest. Therefore The Call has in
good conscience eschewed license. It has preferred
to be tolerant of some wrongs rather than be the
agent of greater wrongs. But there are some duties
that no paper should avoid. It owes something to
public morality and to a vestal condition of society,
and in discharge of this obligation it must know no
friend and no enemy. It must be void of any motive
except the protection of the honor of the innocent,
and that purity which is the happiness of the life that
is and of that hoped for. *
THE POWER OF THE PRESS.
UNDER its existing management The Call has
taken a very sober view of the responsibility of
a newspaper.

Thomas O'Connor, an employe of the

the head with an iron bar and is now In
the Harbor Hospital suffering from con
cusston of the brain, while O'Connor Is
locked up In the Harbor police station,
charged with "assault with a deadly
weapon."
Cassidy, who lives at 18 Perry street,
drove ltito the Santa Fe yards at the foot
of Main street yesterday afternoon with a
four-horse team. While rounding a cor
ner he knocked over a wheelbarrow. That
angered O'Connor and ho called Cassidy
names. The latter got down from his seat
on the wagon and squared off at O'Connor
and was struck on the head with a bar
of Iron which O'Connor had picked up.
Policeman Bean placed O'Connor under
arrest, and then a friend of Cassldy's ran
in and struck O'Connor. He got away In
the general melee that followed and the
police are now looking for him.

Joseph Zelicich. one of. the steerage pas

very near to being sent back to Australia.
He is a Polish Jew, and when passed by
the quarantine officer thought everything
was O K. Then he ran up against the
immigration officer, and that gentleman
at once asked how much money he had.
Zelicich thought It was a case of hold-up
and produced a six penny piece. That
sum, he swore, was all he had in the
Â¦world. He also assorted that he had no
relatives in this country and came here
solely to make a living.
"You can't land," said Inspector de la
Torre. "You must go back to Australia
because you are a pauper, and paupers
cannot land In the United States."
As they were taking Zelicich away he
broke down and said he had plenty of
money. Taken back before the immigra
tion officer he disrobed, and plastered
around his body was Â£400 in Â£5 Bank of
England notes. He was allowed to land.
MISTAKE OF AN" IMMIGRANT.
Judge Hunt has reached the conclusion
that some of his instructions to the jury
were contrary to law, and hence has
granted a new trial. His decision that the
defendants were entitled to show to the
jury that the plaintiffs owned a $300,000
estate he holds was not error, but on
other points granted a new trial. Â«â¢ *Â»
The children sued for $100,000 damages,
and joined Captain Thomas Wallace of
the City of Chester as a defendant, but
after' a lengthy hearing a Jury, on Feb
uary 11. 1S9<5, rendered a verdict in favor
of the defendants and against the plain
tiffs.
The old story of the sinking of the City

jury in Judge Hunt's court. An opinion

and also $45 on the charge side in the cash
book and enter $30 on the credit aide. This
would simplify the posting.
Note.â Look until you find the mistake or take
the money out of your own pocket and put it
into the till. If you make* good a shortage
yourself the same rule should apply when the
cash Is over and the money should go Into your
own pocket. This would be a very unwise and
unsafe rule. You should neither make rood
losses nor apply overs to your own use. If you
cannot make your cash balance it is the busi
ness of your employer to remove you and put
some one more competent in your place. It Is
best, perhaps, in the case of an occasional error
which cannot be Immediately discovered to put
a slip in the cash drawer for a day or two.
You may think of something the following day
which will explain the mistake. If the error
cannot be explained open an account in your
ledger which you may call "overs and shorts."
Charge this account with "shorts" and credit It
with "overs," making the corresponding en
trie* in your cash book.
7. Tou hold a note of $1000 (upon which
interest $45 has accrued) made by Brown.
You sell it to a note broker for $1015. What
entries?
Xote. â Credit cash with the. face of the note
and the protest fee and charge both amounts to
Brown.
5. Received from Henry Brown cash $100
to apply on overdue note and a new sixty
day note for the balance, including the
protest fee and $7 50 added for interest on
the new note.
Note.â Beg^n by charring Brown with $7 60 in
terest and crediting the Interest and discount
account. Now credit Brown with $100 cash and
the full face value of the new note. Chargs
cash with $100 and bills receivable with the
amount of the note. The old note should be
returned to Brown.
6. At the end of the day you find your
cash drawer shows cash on hand $2 50 less
than the amount shown in the cash book.
How will you make your cash balance?
4. Henry Brown failed to pay his note
due to-day. Our bank had it protested
and notified us that th? amount was
charged to our account, Including protest
fee $1 60.
Note. â Charge Jones with the gross amount of
the sale and credit the merchandise (goods) ac
count. Credit Jones with both drafts: the first
draft you charge to cash and the second to bills
receivable.
3. John Anderson drew on us at sight
for $1000 and at twenty days' sight for
$1450. Accepted both drafts, making
them payable at my bank.//;'
Note.â Charge Anderson with the amount of
both drafts. The spot draft must be credited to
cash, because In accepting It making It pay
able at the bank we are really giving out our
own check. The time draft when accepted Is a
promissory note and must be credited to bills
payable. ; â¢;;:
2. Sold merchandise valued at $4026 S3 to
Paul Jones; drew on him at sight for $1000
and at thirty days* sight for JloOO, balance
on account. (Both drafts honored.)
Note.â If we had sold goods we should have
credited the roods account: wÂ» tell bills receiv
able and we credit the bills receivable account
with (400. WÂ« char?* the cash account with
}4C0. just as though the bank had paid us the
full amount. We make the first two entries,
crediting- bills receivable and debiting cash.
Just as though there were no discount to be con
sidered. Now, suppose that we take H from
our cash drawer and hand It to the bank to pay
the discount. We should then credit our cash
account" with *4 and for th* opposite entry we
open a new account called "discount and in
terest" and charge it with $4. The bank will
be obliged to wait until the note falls due he
fore they can get their Â»4flO. so that the U they
charge us Is really Interest.
. Such accounts as expense, wages, loss
and gain, etc., are really branches of the
proprietor's own account. When he pays
out cash for wages, for Instance, he
credits cash and charges wages. In'charg
ing wages he really charges himself, but
for convenience the amount is placed in
wages, so that at the end of the year he
may know what the gross wages for the
year may amount to.
1. Had Charles Cameron's note for $400
discounted at our bank: the bank charged
us $4 discount (interest) and paid us the
difference in cash. .V- Â¦-
Debit the receiver for what Is received;
credit the giver for what Is parted with.
Every transaction shows both a debit
and a credit. Debtor means receiver, one
who gets into debt. Creditor means a
payer; one who parts with something.
When we debit a man we charge him, and
an entry is made on the charge or debit
side of his account. When we credit a
man we give* him credit and an entry is
made upon the credit (right hand) side of
his account. This general. rule is worth
remembering:
The principal book is called the ledger;
all other books sre auxiliary to the ledger.
Very often the ledger is subdivided into
main ledger, cash book,- petty ledger, bill
book, etc. Making entries in the ledger is
called posting.
The system of bookkeeping known as
double entry Is a device for detecting
omissions and errors. Every transaction
Is entered twiceâ once as a debit and once
as a credit. The accounts' are always In
balance â that !s, the total debits at any
time are equal to the total credits.
ZZL HOW TO BO DOTTBLE ENTHY.
Mary C. Carroll, widow of the late John
M. Carroll, has applied for letters of ad
ministration upon the $23 AX) estate of the*
deceased. David O'Keefe. who died De
cember IS, left *n estate <*cceeding $10.0Ct)
In value. A petition for letters of adminis
tration upon the same was tile 1 yesterday
by John O'Keefe, decedent's brother.
G. 11. Umbsen has applied for letters of
administration upon the estate of the late
Thomas Bayne. Mrs,* Elizabeth Bayne,
decedent's widow. I* his sole heir-at-law.
His estate exceeds J1O.0OO In value. /
The will of Charles Matthews, who died
December 13. leaving an estate valued at
more than J10.0CO. .was filed for probate
yesterday. Decedent bequeaths his estata
to his widow, Teresa E. Matthews.
Widow â Administration Letters
Upon Estates Asked.
Decedent Bequeaths His Estate to His
CHARLES MATTHEWS' WILL
IS OFFERED FOB PROBATE
Both, Each, Everyâ Both, meaning "the
two, and not merely one of them." groups
of objects, as. "Both were men of hot
temper." Kach means "all of any num
ber, considered one by one." aa, "Each
boy recited in his turn." Every means
"all of any number, considered as com
posing a group or class." an, "Every
pupil should have a dictionary and use It
freely." ,
Bound. Determinedâ Bound properly
means "obliged," "fated," or "under ne
cessity." as. "A man is bound by hfs
word ; "We hold ourselves in gratitude
bound to receive â¢ â¢ â¢ all such per
sons." In the sense of "determined"
bound Is not In good us#. In the FensÂ« of
"sure" it is in colloquial but not in liter
ary use.
By, With â To Introduce the agent of an
action by la now commonly used: the
material Instrument or tool 13 usually in
troduced by with. as. "Duncan was mur
dered by Macbeth with a dagger."
Note â This completes the series of les
sons on English by Professor Buehler.
Balance, Rest. Remainder â Balance,
meaning "the difference between two
sides of an account," Is a commercial
term, and cannot properly be used for rest
or remainder. Rest is used of persons or
things, and of large as well aÂ» of small
parts. Remainder Is used only of things,
and denotes a comparatively small part.
The following sentences are correct: "He
has a balance at his banker's": "the rest
of the boys stayed behind": "the remain
der (or rest) of the hour was spent in con
versation."
Back ofâ Back of. though frequently
heard In conversation and sometimes
seen in crint. is not in good use.
Avocation, Vocationâ Vocation means
"calling" or ."profession"; avocation,
"something aside from one's regular call
ing." a "by-work," as, "Let your base
ball be a pastime, not a trade: let it be
.your avocation, not your vocation."
Allusion. Illusion. Delusionâ An allusion
is an indirect reference to something not
definitely mentioned. Roughly speaking
an illusion is an error of vision; delusion,
of judgment. "In literary and popular
use an illusion is an unreal appearance
presented in any way to the bodily or tha
mental vision; it is often pleasing, harm
less, or even useful. â¢ â¢ â¢ A delusion is
a mental error or deception, and may
have regard to things actually existing."
"There were two allusions to the riots ii
his sermon"; "the cleverest men are of tea
under a delusion about women"; "the
mirage is an illusion."
Among. Between â Among is the proper
word when tiie reference is to more than
two persons or things, or groups of per
sons or things: between, when the refer
ence is to two only, as: "He divided the
apples among the five boys"; "There ia
bad feeling between Japan and Russia.*
Amount, Quantity. Numberâ Amount
means "sum total," and is used of num
bers or quantities; quantity 13 used of
things which are measured; number, of
things which are counted, as: "Our week
ly expenses vary in amount"; "Gulliver
asked the king of LJllput for a large num
ber of iron bars and a considerable quan
titv of rope."
At, In â Before names of places to denote
"where." at is used when the place is so
small as to be treated as a mere point, or
when, although large, it is viewed as a
mere point; in Is used when it i3 desired
to make prominent the idea "within th<Â»
bounds of," as, "He arrived at Liverpool
in the morning and remained in that city
two days." Before the name of the place
in which the speaker dwells, if the placo
is of any size, in is generally preferred
to at, unless the place is so remote that
it dwindles in the mental vision to a
point.
Ability, Capacityâ Ability is the power of
doing; capacity, the power of containing,
of understanding, of acquiring, as "The
capacity of the room is not great" ; "Each
gave according to his abilty."
Affect, Effectâ To affect is "to act up
on." "to influence"; to effect is "to bring
about": as "She was greatly affected by
the news"; "They went home without
effecting their purpose."
Aggravating, Irritatingâ In good use
aggravating means "making heavier,
more grave, worse in some -way." It Is
often misused for Irritating, exasperating,
or provoking. The following sentences
are correct: "Some of his remarks were
very irritating (exasperating, provoking);
'The crime was committed under aggra
vating circumstances."
speaker's meaning obscure, as when a
friend, of the present writer once asked a
young lady to "go riding" with him. At the
appointed hour he drove to her house la
a carriage and was astonished to see her
come down to meet him in her riding hab
it. But the mistake was his. not hers.
If he had asked her to go "driving" she
would have known what he meant. Some
times the use of a word in an unauthor
ized sense makes the speaker seem ridlc
lous, as when a person of the writor'a
acquaintance suggested that an oil paint
ing might be cleaned by "washing It In
torpid water," and another person of the
writer's acquaintance introduced his
newly wedded second wife as "my late
wife." Much of the humor of Sheridan'3
delightful comedy. "The Rivals." flowa
from the linguistic mistakes of Mrs. Mal
aprop, who says, among other amusins?
things: "Observe me. Sir Anthony. I
would by no means wish a daughter of
mine to be a progeny of learning; I don't
think so much learning becomes a young
woman; for Instance, I would never let her
meddle with Greek or Hebrew or algebra
or simony or fluxious or paradoxes or
such inflammatory branches of learning.
â¢ â¢ â¢ But. Sir Anthony. I would send
her at 9 years old to a boarding- school In
order to learn a little Ingenuity and arti
fice. Then, sir, she should have a super
cilious knowledge in accounts, and I would
have her instructed in geometry, that sh<Â»
might know something of contagious
countries. This. Sir Anthony, is what I
would have a woman know." These blun
ders of Sheridan's famous character
might seem exaggerated if we did not
hear in our own day of an aspiring moth
er in real life who took her daughter to
Europe "to study under the old masters."
who "had a bust made of her daughter's
hand" and, who, on landing from the
steamer, was so glad to get on terra cotta
again." If time served the present writ
er could give many similar illustrations
from his own observation. In every case
the misuse of a word leaves an unpleas
ant impression on the mind of a culti
vated person. Unfortunately, since the
number of words in our language la very
large it is impossible to mention all the
cases in which words have been or may
be mistaken for one another. In general
a writer or speaker must depend upon
dictionaries or books of synonyms to sup
plement what he has learned through ob
servation. All that can be attempted
here is to distinguish some words fre
quently confounded.

the Venezuelan Government near Lo

WASHINGTON. Dec. 24.-Captaln Haw

ALLEGED DISCOVERY OF
FATHEE MARQTJETTE'S BONES
Remains of the Missionary and Ex
plorer Said to Have Been Found â¢
in Michigan.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Dec. 24.â Announcement
is made by Ann Arbor Railway officials
that what is supposed to be the remains
of Father Marquette, the intrepid mission
ary and explorer, have been exhumed by
workmen neor Frankfort, Mich. Only the
skull and some imperfect bones remained,
and experts declare them to be those of a
white man. A stream of rust was found
near the head, and is supposed to have
been the father's beads. The Michigan
Historical Society claims to possess tho
proof that Father Marquette was burled
at this point in the year 1675, in the bed
of a small stream. .
It was in changing the . course of a
stream that the remains were found.
Great interest is being taken in the find.
A thorough investigation is being made.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 24.â The German
Embassy has laid before the State De
partment the claims of a number of Ger
man subjects for damages to their inter
ests in Cuba as a result of the Spanish-
American war and the Insurrection which
led up to the war itself. This action has
raised a most important issue and the De
partment of State has given it the closest
consideration. It has been concluded,
however, that the United States Govern
ment cannot accept responsibility for the
claims. They are regarded as practically
the same in principle as the claim of
Porto Rico against Cuba for $2,500,000 on
account of a war loan. Although in that
case Governor Allen of Porto Rico repre
sented the United States Government in
preferring the claim, that Government
was obliged to deny its liability or the
liability of Cuba under present conditions.
The answer to the German presentation
will be based upon. the reply to Governor
Allen, recently made. It is known that
other governments besides Germany have
claims aggregating a very large sum, all
based on the Cuban Insurrection and suc
ceeding events. They will nbt be aban
doned on account of the attitude of the
United States Government, but' probably
â¢will be held In abeyance until Cuba will
have become Independent, when they will
be presented directly to the island Gov
ernment.

ASK INDEMNITY
SCRANTON. Pa,, Dec. 24.-The second
day of the streetcar men's strike passed
off as quietly as the first. Seven men Im
ported from Syracuse joined with the
company's superintendents, foremen,
clerks and three old employes In manning
eight cars, and although they ran through
all parts of the city from daybreak until
nightfall not a single instance of violence
or even Intimidation was reported.
The strikers quietly went among the
men who were taking their places and
succeeded in Inducing four of them tOj
quit and In exacting promises from three
others not to go to work to-morrow. One
of the men from Syracuse was provided,
with transportation by the strikers and
returned home. Two others turned in
with the strikers in helping to induce the
other seven to quit.
Very few persons rode on the cars even
after it became evident that there was
no danger of violence. Even aged women
preferred to labor along under a load of
Christmas bundles for two or three miles
than to be seen riding on the tabooed"
cars.
All sorts of wagons and carriages were
pressed lrto service by the livery men to
carry people to and from the suburbs, and
the steam roads up and down the valley
ran extra trains to the suburban towns, so
by one means or another shoppers man
aged to go into the central portion of the
city and business was not as seriously
affected as was dreaded.
Boys placed rubbish and stones on the
Green Ridge tracks during the afternoon,
but this was the extent of interference.
The few cars that kept up irregular trips
to the more important suburbs were
jeered along the line, but this and some
opprobrious epithets were the worst the
men on the cars were called upon to en
dure.
General Manager SIHiman and President
Clark of Philadelphia had a long confer
ence to-day and at its conclusion Mr.
Clark returned to Philadelphia. Mr. Silli
man stated after the conference that the
company is satisfied with the situation
and prospects and proposes to continue
its policy of gradually increasing the num
ber of cars In operation day by day until
all are running, rather than to attempt to
resume on a large scale. This policy ho
believes will be less liable to incite
trouble.
The strikers have men at every railroad
station watching for men who are re
ported to be coming to take their places.
Organizer of Mine-Workers Must
WARNER IS IMPRISONED.
Serve. for Assault.
BALTIMORE, Dec. 24.â William War
ner, organizer of the United Mine Work
ers, and leader in tho recent miners'
strike in the Georges Creek mines, en
tered the Maryland House of Correction
yesterday to serve a term of six months'
imprisonment Imposed upon him by the
courts of Allegheny County for participat
ing in an assault upon non-union men
during the strike. With him were 'five
others convicted and sentenced for the
same offense, and six others are behind
the bars of the Allegheny County Jail for
shorter terms.
Warner and . his companions were
shaved, their hair was clipped short and
striped clothes were put upon them as in
the case with ordinary malefactors.
Strong efforts are basing made to Induce
Governor Smith to pardon Warner, as it
is generally believed his offense was moro
technical than actual, his contention
being that he was attempting to prevent
the trouble rather than to incite it, as wa3
claimed by the prosecution at the trial.

churia.
CO2JGER. SIGNS AGREEMENT.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 24.â The Xo
oe Vremya sharply criticizes the Joint
ote of the powers to China as being too
-Â¦ng to produce effect. It says the actu
ations a.Tainst the Emperor and DowasÂ«r
impress are unfounded, and that the ao
usation that Prince Tuan alone is rrâ
possible 'or the treachery is ridiculous.
The pr. per adds:
"Ruiers sometimes betray their own
our.tr>. but treason toward foreign pow
ra is a new conception. The statement
D the ultimatum that the troops will not
>e v.ith-irawn before the conditions are
accepted cannot mean Russia., -whose
iroope have already vaca-ted Pechill,
whereas iianchurian affairs do not con
cern the powers. The note will not bring
peace. The powers possibly repent not
having Imitated Russia's example."
A special to the Xovoe Vremya from
Vladivostok says the exploitation of the
principal Manchurian railroad line and
the construction of branch lines to Port
Arthur will he turned ever to thÂ» Govern
ment. Russia has always carefully Jn
eisted that the Mar.churian railway en
terprise was purely the affair* of a Rus
sian privat? corporation. The news, if
true, u rf preat importance politically.
Accompanies His Signature With an
Explanatory Note.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 24.â Secretary
Hay lias received a cablegram from Min
ister Conger at Peking announcing that
ho had signed the agreement reached by
the f-re:p:i Minlsiers. but had done so
with a written explanatory statement set
ting forth the exact position of his Gov
ertantnt, The text <if the statement is
.;<>â¢. ftrwarded by Mr. Conger, but it is
understood to be iiased upon the last in
struction he received from the Depart
ment, which, while disapproving the in
.iusion in the apxe^ment cf some of the
mere severe language, accepted it as the
Oest arrangement shat could be made at
this time.
It is believed that the United States
,-ilso. vrhile sanctioning the provisions of
the agreement relative to the maintenance
of permanent lines of communication,
legation guards and prohibition o f the im
poruitlon of arms into China. Indicates
clearly that constitutional reasons prevent
h< Executive making any pledge to take
:>art in the execution of these plans.
The signing of the agreement by the
-Â¦lini.sters closes what is regarded here as
;he first, the most important and the most
.iiflicult phase of the negotiations as to
"nina. for it is not doubted that the Chi
:>Â»se envoys will subscribe to the agree

BERLIN, Dec. 24.â Emperor William's
bestowal upon Count von Bulow, Imper

the Order of the Black, Eagle, is inter
preted to signify Imperial approval of his
recent utterances In the Reichstag, par
ticularly of his successful management of
the China trouble, as well as the Kruger
Incident, as against the pan-German agi
tation. It is understood that his Majesty
regards the Chancellor's present tour in
South Germany as a great success in
cementing the adherence of other German
Cabinets to the Emperor's foreign policy.
Herr Warrinski, director of tne Deut

The National Zeitung, a Journal usually
friendly to the Unlteu States, discussing
the rejection of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty lit its original form by the Senate,
eays:
"The incident means such a slap at the
executive as can scarcely be found, not
only in the history of the United States,
but In the parliamentary history of the
world. Presumably the treaty is not now
acceptable to Great Britain."
Count Snoilsky, military attache of the
Swedish and Norwegian legations in
Berlin, who recently disappeared, but was
subsequently found suffering from mental
derangement, will return to Sweden im

Bulow asking for tjie maintenance of tho
present tariff policy of the empire, pro
testing particularly against maximal and
minimal duties and the abandonment of
the most favored nation clause and ex
tension of the ad valorem system.
The Christmas weather in Berlin is

"Well, who'd 'a thought that Abe Lin
coln would be strutting around the streets
vith a diamond pin in hia shirt front!"
exclaimed Moyers in mock surprise.':
Lincoln ' looked vaguely abashed and
tried to explain. The explanation ended
by. his taking the pin from his shirt and
pinning it on Moyers, insisting as he did
so that he did not want It and was only
too anxious to get rid of It. - Moyers kept
the ornament for some- time -and finally
gave it to a friend, James Drummond.
Drummond was captured during the war
by the Federals and died at Fort Monroe.
In 1866 a sale of his property and personal
effects took place at Barnewell, S. C.
Among the latter was the pin that had be
longed to Lincoln. Colonel .Cave bought
it for a small sum. He knew its history
â¢and 'prizes the relic highly. â Atlanta Con
stitution. - . . â¢
Lincoln was naturally a man of quiet
taste in matters of dress and seldom wore
Jewelry of any kind. However, his acci
dental possession of a fine ornament
proved a temporary temptation to adorn
himself. One day James Moyers, a stock
dealer of Kentucky and a close personal
friend of Mr. Lincoln, who- had known
him intimately . from childhood, went to
Springfield on a visit. As soon as he saw
Lincoln the pin attracted his attention.
Colonel W. N.' Cave of r Barnewell, S. C..
who is now in Atlanta on business, is in
possession of a unique relic in the shape
of a diamond pin which was at one time
the property of Abraham Lincoln, and
which is the only piece of jewelry of the
kind that President Lincoln ever wore.
The pin Is of the old-fashioned style of
cluster brooches, with a clasp at the back
for the purpose . of â¢ securing it to the
frilled shirt fronts worn by gentlemen
fifty years ago. The center diamond is a
large, particularly white one, and it-. Is
surrounded by a number of smaller bril
liants.
The pin has a strange history. Some
years before the war and prior to the
time that Abraham "Lincoln was begin
ning to loom up as a Presidential possi
bility, while practicing law In Illinois he
met a young dandy /rom New York State
whose sporting proclivities had caused
him to run short of funds. The young
fellow went to Lincoln for assistance, and
left with him as security for a loan a
handsome diamond pin. For some reason
he never returned to redeem the pledge,
and from that day Lincoln did not again
see him.

"That describes them exactly, and I am
certain tho poem must have been Inspired
by a California livery stable. Wars may
rage and thrones may decay, and Mao
may annex the Filipinos or tell them to
go to thunderâ but nothing will ever dis
turb the grand serenity of that group at
the front door. I think it very nnkind of
fate that I should have become a hard
working professional man. I -would have
made a superb ornament for one of those
cane-bottomed chairs." â New Orleans
Times-Democrat.
"I have always envied those men who
Bit In front of livery stables," said a citi
zen who admits that ha is constitutionally
lazy.
"That seems to me a beautiful life. It
must bo one long, sweet song, as the poet
puts it. I have never known any of
them personally," he continued, sighing,
"but I have watched them all my life,
and they fill me with a yearning to be a
livery stable man. When I was a boy I
had to pass a larre livery stable on my
way to school. It had an immense double
door, which was never closed, and inside
waa a cool, dim vista of stalls and buggies
In rows. Four men were always seated
at the threshold, tilted back in cane-bot
tomed chairs. They were large, well-fed,
contented-looking men, and what im
pressed me particularly was their air of
placid abstraction. They* never said any
thing to one another, but sat there calmlv
gazing into space and chewing straws. I
remember distinctly that . the sight of
them always filled me with rebellion
against "work and made my school tasks
seem all the more abhorrent. I had an
almost irreslstlblo inclination to chuck
my books into the gutter, seize a cane
bottomed chair and .a straw and become
a livery stable man myself.
"I have never got rid of that feeling-,"
the lazy citizen went on. lighting his pipe,
"and the strange part about It Is this: In
all the years that have gone by that group
at the big dcor has never changed, and.
moreover, it Isn't peculiar to any one
stable. It Is common to them all. Go
where you will, whenever you encounter
a livery stable you will invariably find
four large, well-fed, contented-looklnc
men tilted back In cane-bottomed chairs
at the entrance, chewing straws and gaz
ing Into 'space. They always look exactly
alike and never get any older or any
younger. It is my private belief that they
are immortal, and I have never asked any
questions because I don't waiit to run the
risk of shattering a beautiful Ideal. What

A born* which was attached to a de

corner of Powell and California street
made a wild run down the steep grade of
the latter thoroughfare at about 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. On reaching the
croFFinj? cf Kfarny Ftreet the now thor
oughly frightened animal, by a miracle,
escaped knocking down several people. In
front of the California Market he collided
vith another horse.
The runaway was thrown, but was soon
en Its feet again, apparently none the
Â¦worse for Its exciting: experience.
The other horse did not fare so well.
Though it managed to hold Its feet, an
examination showed that the poor beast's
legr was broken. A large crowd had col
lected and Policeman Reade 'was called
*:pon to kill the horse, to end its misery.

Woodward said:' "He did not beat me,
but you ask the others. Mackinnon put
up $20. Arthur Holland was Infatuated,
and, if Colonel McKillican did not part
with. a double eagle, he was lucky."
Â¦ Mackinnon said: "The Colonel didn't
reach me, but you see Woodward. He was
willing to bet a month's commissions the
Colonel was OK."
Mrs. Ada R. Harris, at whose lodging
house, 566 Eleventh street. Colonel Pow
ers had a room, said:
"It seemed very odd that bo wealthy a
man should have a little coffee pot in his
room and live on coffee and doughnuts,
but he said he couldn't stand restaurant
fare. He said he was going to send for a
foster-daughter, whom he had found In
the wilds of Mexico, and who now re
ceived $1000 a month from him. The Col
onel paid his room rent of $3 and disap
peared after telling me he had bought a
$75,000 lot."
The story runs that Frank J. Wood
ward, W. H: Mackinnon, Arthur Hol
land and Colonel Robert McKillican all
knew the dapper colonel to their sorrow.
Colonel Powers came to town a week
ago, made quick connections with leading
firms,- passed- the word along that he had
13,000,000, made in the southern republic
mines, and waa going to Invest H.000,000 in
Oakland. Colonel Powers- likewise told
some rare stories of the days when he
fought under Colonel Jack Hays In the
Texas Rangers, and how he drove the
Mexicans across the Rio Grande.
Colonel John Powers, alleged millionaire

The Merchants' Loan and Trust Com

It is understood the grantors in the sev
eral deeds filed will have to establish In
the probate court their titles to the prop
erty and the interests they have so trans
ferred. As these heirs are non-residents,
it is expected some nice legal points will
be raised in the courts before their right
to name an administrator is established. .
CHICAGO. Dec. 24.â All claims In Inter
est In the estate of the late Charles -.W.
Fullerton have been concentrated In Miss
Mattle Hill, half-sister of the decedent,
as the daughter of his father's second
wife. The concentration was effected by
means of a number of deeds filed for rec
ord to-day, in which the heirs at law of
the estate transfer their Interests to Miss
Hill. These deeds, however, it is under
stood, do not relieve the heirs at law of
the necessity of proving their several
claims to the estate, and do not in any
degree interfere with the legal process
commenced in the probate court to-day,
when the heirs at law made application to
Judge Cutting to have the Merchants'.

ministrators for the estate.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.1118 Broadway. Dec. 24.
Captain William S. Thaxter, at one time
a prominent mariner and pilot of San
Francisco, was returned to-day from this
city to the State hospital at Agnews, from
which institution he was released on
parole several weeks ago. Captain Thax
ter became mentally unsound last March
and was committed to the hospital from
San Francisco. His tendencies were to
violence.
His relatives '.were anxious to care for
him outside if his condition permitted, and
friends have been very solicitous for the
afflicted mariner's condition. Captain
Taylor of 220 Durant- street has given spe
cial attention to Captain Thaxter, but on
Saturday was compelled- to make a re
quest upon the authorities to again take
charge of the captain because he had be
come unmanageable. Mrs. Thaxter, who
resides at 1625 Seventh- avenue, was
compelled to join In the request, fearing
her demented husband would either injure
himself or those who were trying to care
for him.
' Captain Thaxter by some unknown way
learned of his friends' movements. He
hired a couple of bodyguards and went to
San Francisco, declaring that he was the
victim of a plot to railroad him to a mad
house." During his stay there the patient
became violent and his hired guards fled.
Thaxter wrote a long letter to Chief of
Police Hodgkins bewailing his fate and
reiterating his delusions about "railroad
ing."
After a forty-eight hours' search Thax
ter was found in a Washington-street
lodging house. He made no resistance to
the officers, who took him to the deten
tion ward at the Receiving Hospital. The
mental disturbance has also been, accom
panied by a serious physical crippling
from rheumatism.
Captain Thaxter has considerable prop
erty. He is being given the best of care
at Agnews.

The temperance people see nothing
hopeful in this unexpected delay, as the
majority of the Trustees have declared
they would enact the ordinance, happen
what may.
"The ordinance as it stands now is cer
tainly illegal and cannot be taken up until
printed twice correctly as required by
law."
"There is no doubt in my mind," said
Trustee R. C. Staats, "that the chango
was made by some one who knew what
he was doing. '*,
President marston was ' likewise con
vinced that the matter was very irreg
ular. â¢ â¢ -
"I believe that this change has been
made on purpose," declared Trustee C.
Hoff. "I have no proof of it, but there
can be no excuse for such a mistake."
BERKELEY, Dec. 24.â Four Town Trus
tees were ready to-night to put to final
passage the ordinance to permit licensing
of saloons. Then.- the quartet made the
discovery that an error in the publication
of the ordinance in the town official paper
prevented them from enacting the law,
and they hurled charges of deliberate Job
bery at B. F. Arnold, manager of the pa
per, and declared he had willfully caused
the mistake, which compels a republlca
tion and delays the final passage of the
license ordinance until Friday night. A
special meeting for that purpose was
called for that time. *
The official paper is the daily Gazette^
which has fought the new ordinance bit
terly. Manager Arnold was not present
at to-night's meeting, and was therefore
unable to explain the situation which en
raged the Trustees. The first publication
of the ordinance last Friday was correct.
It occupied more than two columns. In
Saturday's ,Issue an advertisement had
been inserted at the bottom of the first
column and the section of the ordinance
occupying that space had been placed at
the bottom of the second column instead
of at the top. No one had noticed the
change until Trustee E. O. Turner arrived
at the meeting and informed his fellow
Trustees. Town Attorney B. A. Hayne
said:

The armament of the Macdonough will
consist of four fourteen-pounder, three
inch rapid-fire guns and three slx-pound
ers. The fourteen-pounders will be placed
one on top of the forward tower anO three
on the center line of the vessel. One six
pounder will be located on each side of
the fcrward tower and the other will be
on the after bridge. The two eighteen-
Inch torpedo tubes are located in the
stern. The cost.ls $281,000.
The outer hull Is of half-inch steel
plates. This s?hell would be pierced if
struck by a projectile. The vessel, how
ever. Is built with twelve separate water
tight compartments. There are two con
ning towers. Accommodations are Â¦ pro
vided for a crew of eighty officers and
men. The ship presents the innovation of
having the officers' quarters forward,
and those of the crew aft. Underneath
the living deck and forward of the boiler
i? a water-tight deck. The engines will
rive tbe Macdonough a speed of thirty
knots.
EAST BRAINTREE, Mass., Dee. 24.-
The torpedo boat destroyer, Macdonough
was launched at the works of the Fore
River Iron Company to-day, amid the
ringing of bells and the blowing of
whistles. Mrs. Lucy Charlotte Macdon
ough Reade. of Philadelphia christened the
vessel with champagne. The new boat
was taken down the river to the Quincy
works of the company.
There were very few of the long list of
invited guests who remained over from
Saturday to witness the launching to-day.
Lieutenant Gustave Kaemmerling, engi
neer of the Olympla during Dewey's bat
tle of Manila Bay. was present.
The Macdonough. which has been in the
course of construction during the past six
months, has aroused great interest
among naval men because it is of a
new type, and is to be one of a fleet of
fifty craft of the same kind. The length
of "the boat is 242 feet, while the entire
breadth of beam is only 22 feet. The ves
sel is fourteen feet deep from deck to
keel and has a displacement of 470 toYis.
6he draws six feet eight inches of water.
No part of the Macdonough is armored
ea ve the forward conning towers, which
are covered with" three-quarter-inch nickel
steel.
The engines are protected only by the
coal bunkers, which extend for 100 feet
amidships on either side, and which have
a capacity for 150 tons of coal, sufficient
to provide a spted of fourteen knots An
hour for 4000 miles.

day dedicated to peace and good will.
Anon the faint strains of Christmas carols
will float out on the midnight air.

The company by omitting the compul
sory clause undoubtedly hopes to over
come the opposition which the organized
brotherhoods have asserted asralnat In
surance by the company. They feared
and openly declared that the schema
was an entering wedge for the disruption
of those organizations, one of their prin
cipal elements of strength being the in
surance of members against accident cr
death in the service. ' 'Â¦Â¦- â¢-,.:?
The monthly payment of $1 for fifteen years
would entitle an employe to 1500 cash and tlO
monthly during Ufa; U W monthly, to $300 caan
and $15 a month; $2, to $11-0 cash and CO a
month; $2 6t>. to $1MO and $23 a month; S3. to
I1SC0 cash and $30 a month during' Ufa. In
case an employe leaves the â¢errlce of the com
pany his pension payments are refunded to him,
and in case of deatji hla beneficiaries would re
ceive the payments he had made with 1 per cent
Interest per annum. The pension money could
not be drawn until the policy bolder had
reached the age of 60 years and retired. Â»Â¦*. .
Tha membership is to be TOhmtsLry for all
employes, and membars mas wlthdarw at tha
end at any month by giving notice by thÂ« 13ta
day of such month, and it to clearly set forth
that the â¢tandln* of an employe JU not to be
affected in any wise by either bÂ«oomins a
member or by withdrawing flora m*mberÂ»nip.
The new scheme also eliminates the re
quirement that employes shall Insure In
dekness and accident funds, leaving tha
kind of insurance to be taken optional
with the applicant. Life Insurance is pro
vided for at the rate of $500 for rorry-nve
cents a month premium. Employes who
leave the service receive no rebate, but
can continue the Insurance at that figure.
The disability section divide* the em
ployes in a haphazardous class composed
of trainmen, engineer*, firemen, train
baggagemen and conductor!, who will
pay one and one-half per cent of the'r
monthly, wages and in case oÂ£ sickness or
accident or Injury to receive sixteen per
cent of their monthly pay each week for
forty weeks and eight per cent a weels
until cured. The second class, non-haz
ardous, composed of shopmen, clerks,
etc., receive the same beneuts upon pay
ment of one per cent a month of their
wages.
Upon payment of stxty cents a month,
employes will receive (300 lor loss of a
hand or a foot and 91500 tor loss of both
hands or both feet or a hand and a foot.
A pension scheme la also attached, as
follows, and applies only to employes who
have been in the company's employ
twenty years or over:
The Southern Pacific Company has
made public Its plan to force lLfo Insur
ance upon its employes tn the face of the
promise made by the late President Hunt
lngton that the scheme, which proved ob
jectionable to the brotherhoods, would be
abandoned. The Call, two weeks ajro.
told the story of the company's new
move and again on December 21 showed
that by a system of petitions the Insur
ance department proposed to have the
scheme brought to a head arid Introduced
upon the Southern Pacific â¢ystem.
The - petition proposition Is being
handled by A. F. Hess and a number of
subordinate employes of the company,
who have been doing missionary worle
among the unorganized departments of.
labor on the system. These petitions have
been freely circulated. Hundreds of them
are now among the man at West Oak
land yards. They will be expected to sign
them and then become members of &
benefit and pension department to bÂ«j
established In accordance with a careful
ly prepared plan, the details of which ara
also being as actively circulated as tha
petitions. The latter read:
We, the undersigned employes of the 6outlirrÂ«
Pacific Company, do hereby respectfully peti
tion the president and board of director* to ap
prove the accompanying rules and regulation*
for government of a benefit and pension de
partment, and If approved to lsaugurat* tae
same, and we hereby certify our <Je*lr* to be
come contributors to one or more of tin features
as provided foe* therein.
Tbe rules eliminate th*Â» eompnlaory
clause which caused the storm of protest
against the original scheme. . In Its stead

The money for the gun? surrendered by
the Malietoa. and Mataafa factions is in
Apia, and the Samoans are awaiting pay
ment, but there are some disputes as to
the manner of paying out. The German
Government Â¦wants to do the whole
through its treasury-, but there are
manv natives row under America's pro
tection who are to receive a considerable
thare of the money.
The German Government Is collecting
â¢11 the back taxes prior to the hoisting of

Some trouble has been caused by the
differences and disputes between the local
missionary societies, one of which is the
Mormon. It became necessary to enact a
law enabling a settlement of disputes, and
a Sunday ordinance is now in force.
The steamship Mariposa arrived on De
cember 6, but only remair.pd a little ovet

in Pagopago.
Maraafa of Upolu does not seem to re
alize that the German Government has
Fupreme control of the government of
Vpolu and fcavall and that the United

ten a letter to the chiefs of Tutuila. in
viting them to attend a gathering of the

placed on Mu'lnuu in Upolu and to bring
presents which may be construed as trib
ute. Th*> Tutuila chiefs have strongly re
sented thp invitation.
There is much Jealousy between the peo
ple of Tutulla and Manua. and this made
itself very apparent during the visit of
the Governor to the latter place. For
many generations the places have been
rivals as to superior lineal descent. The
<~hlef of the. Native Guard is a Tutuila
high chief, a division of the guard is sta
tioned at Manua under a Manua chief, it
tv&s arranged to have a general review of
the whole guard at Manu. and the main
body from Tutuila accompanied the Gov
ernor on Â»his tour. At Manua the local
chief objected to be under Lelato. the Tu
tulla chief, and the relationship was
strained for a while. Governor Tilley in-
Fisted that the Manua chief must obey
this superior officer and left the Tutuila
chief to act. Lelato. at the review and in
spection, placed the Insubordinate Manua
chief in the ranks instead of being in his
position ne an officer. Matters were then
Fettled amicably. But the Samoans do not
know when to stop, and when the rest of
the Tutuila people heard of it they were
indienart and expressed a wish to resort
to the Samoan custom of paying a visit
to Mttnua and clubbing a few of the in
habitants. Ivleutenant-Commander Dorn
l-as checked thirn by threatening to pun

day with his shock of red hair bristling
with pride, a glow of satisfaction on his
face and fairly exuding Joy, relates thÂ«
NÂ«w York Tribune. He spread out before
Frank Campbell, chairman of the State,

reproduced pictures of Bryan and Steven
son, folds of the American flag and the In
scription: "We wish to remain freÂ« ppo

"How's that, yer honor?" said "Blm.''
Mr. Campbell looked at It a moment and
"You want to change that Inscription,

remain a free people.' "
"Btm" looked hard at Mr. Campbell,
and said: "Yer honor, X sun a scholar, I

"There Is more movement In California Lon
don layer raisins, with possibly a little better
feeling on these goods owing to some reduc
tion of the quantity of layers on the spot.
Sales of 4000 boxes of 8-crown layers were re
ported yesterday at $1 40 for shipment to some
market south of New York. There haa been
some business In 2-crown aad 3-crown layers
also at from a little under $1 833*1 45. Loose
raisins are easier, with small demand. Some
3-crown goods have been sold as low as 6c.
Malaga cluster raisins are lower. Jobbers re
port a very good demand for Malagas for the
holiday trade. Prunes are selling very slowly,
with no sign of improvement at the moment.
Currants are easier, but quotations remain
about the same. Evaporated apples are quiet
â¢Some holders ask as high as 5V*o for prime, but
no bids of over 6c are heard of. Chops are
firmer, eales for January being reported at
$1 37tt
"Qrenoble and Naples walnuts are lower.
French are selling quite freely at 9H@9%c. Fil
berts are In fair request." .
'â¢Trade shows a little more activity, though,
sales aro mostly of email lots.. Persian dates
were Mo lower yesterday, the arrival of the"
Mlnnehaha from London with around 21.000
boxes new crop goods causing the spot market
to decline to meet the quotations ! for the new
arrivals. Demand continues fairly active, sales
of several thousand boxes being reported.

It Is known that Governor Pickens had
children by three marriages, Douschfca
being the youngest, but that one of his
daughters had been killed certainly Is not
eenerallv known. Governor Pickens died
about the close of the war. Douschka
grew up to -lovely womanhood and mar
ried Dr. Dugas of Augusta. Ga. She died
a year ago. The priceless jewels present
ed her by the Czar are in the possession
of her little daughters.
A few years later occurred another re
markable event in her life, which was
more sad and heartrending than it was
remarkable. It was a sad wedding scene.
Her half-sister, a daughter of her father
by a formÂ«r marriage, was to be married.
They stood at the sacred altar,- Little
Douschka stood with the attendants near
the bride with both hands full of flowers.
A moment more and these two throbbing
hearts would be joined for life and two
lives happily united In one. But, alas!
Just as the solemn words fell from the
minister's lipsâ "now I pronounce you"â
all were startledâ a shriek, a groan, a
frantic scream and all was changed. A
cruel ball from a Federal gunboat, which
was aadlng to besiege the doomed city,
crashed through the roof of the sacred
place and struck the fair young bride full
In the chest and dashed out the young
life Just at this joycus period. Her warm
life blood was scattered over all the at
tendar.ts and the groom and little
Douschka were nearly drenched. This
was surely one of the saddest scenes in
all the dark years of carnage that madft
the South a desolation and filled the land
with mourners.
The pride of the South has always been
its beautiful and cultured women. Every
Southern State has had its historic hero
ine, the very name of which thrills a pat
riotic chord In thousands of warm South
ern hearts. Among the many whose
names are sacredly enshrined in the his
toric page is that of Louise Holcomb, one
of Texas' fairest daughters, who was inti
mately associated with much that was
dear to every Southern heart, and the
subject of a most touching and patriotic
romance. V:'^-
In 1856 she was married to the dashing
ajid historic Colonel Flckens, who was
then representing South Carolina in Con
gress. Her life in Washington was short
as the next year the colonel was sent to
Russia by President Buchanan. With his
young and beautiful and brilliant wife he
soon oecame the favorite of the Czar and
Empress, while all St. Petersburg was
their willing subjects. In 1S58 their first
and only child was born in the Czar's own
palace of Romanoff, which he had kindly
placed at their disposal. The Empress
was "bo much attached to the young
mother that she claimed the right of god
mother lor the baby v and gave her the
strange but expensive name of Douschka,
which means in the Russian language
"little darling."
In the same year that Lincoln was elect
ed President Colonel Pickens was elected
Governor of South Carolina. He re
signed his diplomatic position and re
turned home. His departure cast a gloom
over the entire court and the little child
was loaded with presents. The Czar, with
his own hand, hung around her neck a
fine minfature of himself in gold. To the
day of his death he never forgot. her, but
the return of each birthday brought with
It a valuable present from the Czar.
Now the scene changes. Lincoln was
inaugurated President and Colonel Pick
ens Governor of South Carolinsu You all
know too well what followed the secession
of most of the Southern States, the or
ganization of the Confederacy at Mont
gomery, Ala., the levying of troops and
the preparation for the terrible war that
followed. Beauregard was in command
at Charleston, and it was deemed best to
reduce Fort Sumter, in Charleston har
bor, so he sent a telegram to the Gover
nor at Columbia to visit the historic city
at once to "witness the inception of hos
tilities." The wife and baby went with
the Governor, who after carefully inspect
ing all the batteries declared that all was
ready. General Beauregard then took the
child In his arms, placed a torch In her
hand and showed her where to touch the
fuse, and thus wae fired the first gun by
little Douschka, the godchild of the Em
press of Russia. But this was not the
fast of her sangninary experiences during
the terrible wax that she started.
In times of. deoperata civil war trage
dies of a private nature, however start
ling they might be In times of peace, at
tract little attention. There has been a
loxend that during the bombardment of
Charleston a bride was killed while the
marriage ceremony was In progress.
Nothing definite has been written about
this incident of the war In many years.

fair ls contained in an old manuscript,

to enter the lodger's room. This. refusal
led to a discussion which ended in a row

both Benicke and Grand were taken to

the efforts of the army ladles, Mrs. Mer

due. They, labored early and late and
spared no pains ,to make the soldiers'

The nurses . and hospital corps men
were not forgotten. They were all re

of the happy occasion.
After the festivities the hall was cleared
and the ladles who had worked so hard
for the gratification of the soldiers danced
until a late hour.
Arthur Waldier, a peddler, 28 years old,
residing at 413 Fourth street, died at the

later became unconscious.

civilian guests. The Press Club Quar
tette then sang, "Hark, the Herald An
gels Sing," and the hymn was rendered
in a manner in keeping with the feelings
displayed by the, soldier boys. ;
Miss Elizabeth "Ames, on the 'cello, and
Miss Marie Wilson on the piano, followed
the quartette, rendering "Elgie" and
"Simple Aveau" in a manner that brought
forth prolonged . applause. Mrs. Dr.
Southall and Miss Florence Brower were
the soloists of the evening and their 86
leotions were a source of -much pleasure.
The programme ended with the song "On
ward, Christian Soldier," the quartet.
At this point the lights were turned off
and the beautifully decorated tree shone
from the center of the "hall. The cheers
and hand-clapping 'â¢ that followed amply
rewarded Colonel Girard. Lieutenant Col
lins and the ladies for their efforts In be
half of the sick soldiers. , .
When the hall was again lighted up, Rev.
John A. B. Wilson gave thanks in a short
prayer for the many blessings enjoyed in
this the last year of the century. The
distribution of 1 the presents was the
source of great merriment. A big, stout
hospital steward reached Into immense
hampers, and, drawing forth a package
carefully labeled, called the name of the
patient to whom It was addressed. Out
of a blue-clad , crowd would dart the
ownerof the name, and, grabbing his
prize, without yiving his companions time
to observe the blushes or tears, disappear
out the door.
Within an hour every soldier had re
ceived a present, and, then came the edi
bles. Heaping' plates ! of : ice . cream; with
all . sorts â¢: of fancy, cakes, -s were handed
around Â¦ by- handsome v young Â¦ ladles, â¢ and
devoured by patients whose appetite â¢ for
OOOD cheer predominated last
night at the Presidio through the
kindheartedness of the army la
dies, the members of the Red
Cross Society and many San
Francisco young" women. The mess hall
of the general hospital was crowded with
the sick and convalescent soldiers, and a
merry, jolly crowd it was. Forgetful of
painful wounds, of illness contracted
while serving Uncle Sam, they were as
sembled at 6 o'clock at the immense hospi
tal and made merry for several hours. The
beautifully decorated wards reflected
great credit on the ward surgeons, nurses
and hospital corps men connected with
the hospital. All were anxious to make
the particular ward directly under their
charge the most beautiful, with the result
that to choose the prettiest was - a Â¦ very
difficult matter.
In the center of the mess hall a mam
moth Christmas tree decorated with-glit
tering tinsel and many colored lights
brought to many a poor fellow, thoughts
of a happy Christmas at home and also
afforded a chance for contrast between a
yuletlde celebration on the tiring line and
a Christma time where their every want
could bo anticipated' by noble-hearted
women.
Some of the soldier guests came on
crutches, some In Invalid chairs and oth
ers were supported to seats around the
tree- by their nurses, but all had a cheer
ful smile, and their "thank yous" upon
the receipt of little remembrances were
heartfelt.
The exercises opened with a few appro
priate words by Chaplain Potter, and his
prayer of thankfulness elicited an amen
from the boys in blue and the assembled

GOD bless you, merry gentlemen." J
The sentiment that predominates
in that good old English carol In
spired the feeling that prevailed
in this city yesterday. The laugh-
Ing, good-natured crowd that thronged the 1
streets, the brightly illuminated stores,
and the clear, cold, yet altogether ideal
weather were all suggestive of the merry
Yuletlde. "On earth, peace, good will
toward men" was in the air everywhere.
The waiter In the "grill" felt it; the hack
driver that bowled the repentant husband
home in the night knew it by an
"extra half." and the poor mendicant,
who drags himself to his lonely room,
was gainer by the Christmas Bpirit In ex
tra pennies.
Yesterday, from early morning until
late at night, crowds thronged the streets,
the Jostling members all eager to buy
their friends some token, great or small
In value, yet all of the same weight in the
scales of the heart. The climate of Cali
fornia must have something to do with
the temperament of the people who yes
terday good-naturedly shouldered each
other on the streets and vied In purchas
ing for friends those annual tokens of
dear remembrance.
The merchants claim that never before
In the history of San Francisco has
Christmas time been Â«>o well observed
from a giving point of view. All the stores
have been crowded. Street venders with
many sorts of toys have lined the side
walks and have sold out their modest
stocks with ease, climbing monkeys,
clowns whose carts dash backward and
forward, and crowing roosters having an
equal vogue in the great race for popu
larity among the inanimates. The rich
man with his spacious mansion and his
servants has not forgotten the season,
nor those who have not been so fortunate
in the acquiring of worldly goods, as he.
Money has been rolling into the treasury
of all the charities of the city with a lib
eral flow. Check after check has been re
ceived by the hospitals from the wealthy.
To-day the blessed nativity of our Lord
will be splendidly celebrated. All the
churches will present appropriate services.
In the Catholic churches masses will be
said from 6:30 until 10:30 in the morning.
At the Cathedral, his Grace, Archbishop
Rlordan, will ax the 11 o'clock pontifical
high mass read a papal benediction from
the holy father to the people of Califor
nia, urging them to fresh vigor in the
work of Catholicism.
In the Episcopal churches there will be
services throughout the day, and the
main feature will be the rendering of
carols.
The Salvation Army to-day give a pub
lic dinner to the poor at Odd Fellows'
Hall, commencing at 2 o'clock. The menu
may perhaps not be such as to tempt the
epicure; It may not be of a quality to ap
peal to those who are used to the luxur
ious restaurants of the gourmets, but the
hungryâ the poor fellow who is in hard
luck â will go to the dinner and leave with
a stronger resolve "to fight the good
fight", and win.
At the City and County Hospital the
sick will celebrate with a good old Christ
mas dinner. Mrs. Phebe Hearst has pro
vided the wherewithal to pay for the
feast. Recently the superintendent re
ceived a check from Mrs. Hearst for $250
and at the same time a letter expressing
good wishes and sympathy for those who
are trying to regain health in that insti
tution.
"Come on and take a chance at, a. turkey
raffle!" This was the cry that fell on the
ears of the busy passerby on the streets
last night. It was rumored that Chief
Sullivan had cast old remembrance to the
winds and had decided the turkey raffles
must go, but last night they were In full
swing. The "booster" was very much tn
evidence. He was to be seen outside the
saloon the same as ever. Harshly and
with set purpose he called out the merits
of the turkey lottery for the passing
throngs to hear.
And they that "go down. to the sea in
ships" have not forgotten that this Is
Christmas. The water front has been pre
paring for the anniversary for several
days. The ships that are now in port
have been gayly decorated in honor of the
occasion. Little apprentices with a lump
in their throat and with a fond wish that
they were home under their â¢parental roof
have been busy making the masts and
rigging of the stanch and sturdy vessels
that brought them across the briny deep
gay with greens and red berries. ,
According to a custom that has been
followed for several years the boys' choir
of the Cathedral Mission of the Good Sa
maritan assembled In several of the hotels
last night and delighted many hundred
listeners by singing Christmas carols and
anthems. The choir is larger and better
drilled than ever this year and for sev
eral hours the young voices filled the spa
cious hotel corridors with sweet, glad
melody. The members, numbering thirty,
were arrayed in black and white vest
ments and made an impressive appear
ance.
The carolers first visited the Palace
Hotel. Here a* large crowd had gathered,
filling the spacious rotunda to its capa
city. The first and second balconies also
contained many listeners, most of whom
were guests of the hotel. The choir took
its place beneath the big illuminated
Christmas tree at the west end of the
court. This tree stands forty feet ' high
and was a veritable blaze of light, with its
several hundred vari-colored electric '
bulbs. This pretty feature was prepared
by Edgar C. Gribble. the hotel's chief
electrician, and he has displayed remark
able skill and good taste in his arrange
ment of the lights.
The choir rendered six or eight selec
tions and then proceeded to the Grand,
where another short concert was given
before almost as large an assemblage.
From the Grand the singers went to the
St. Nicholas, then, to the Colonial, the
Pleasanton, the California and finally the
Occidental, the last mentioned hotel being
reached shortly before midnight Col
lections were taken at each place for the
benefit of the parish poor. Mrs. Brown,
organist of the mission, acted as director.
The following selections were given:
Hymn. "O. Come All Te Faithful." carol
(old Ensrltsh): "God Bless You. Merry Gentle
men" (traditional): carol. "Now Over the
Snow-white Meadows" (Stalner); carol, "Good
Kins Weneeela" (traditional): carol. "When
Chrirt War. Bom cf Mary" (Brown); anthem.
"Nazareth" (Gounod): carol. "Who Is This
That Was. So Lowly?" (Foster): carol, "O,
Little Town of Bethlehem" (Redner).

judge Dalngerfield also refused to Issue
a restraining order enjoining Mrs. Smith
from molesting her former nusband. In,
denying the restraining order Judge E>ain
gerfield Bald, however, that he did bo
without prejudice, and in the event Mrs.
Smith's conduct becomes such that Mr.
Smith feels that he needs the protection
of the court the motion for an injunction
may be renewed ax any time. This closed
the case and Smith, manifestly relieves,
left the court in company with bis attor
ney.
Various other couples were given
Christmas presents in the way of a
release from marital obligations yes
terday. Decrees of divorce were granted
Nancy G!a?sfcrd from John R. Glassford
for desertion; Bertha Peterson from Nels
P. Peterson for extreme cruelty: Kathan
Rotke from Sarah Koike for desertion;
Mary E, Infantine from Nicholas Infant
ine for willful neglect: Daniel Goldber?
from Emilie Goldbenc for desertion:
Anr.a Densmore from John Densmore for
â¢willful neglect, and Sadie Xelson from
Prank A. Nelson for extreme cruelty.
Nicholas T. Smith, also of the Southern
Pacific Company, testified that Mrs. Smith
frequently called at iier former husband's
place of business and '"acted in a riotous
manner," calling him vile nameÂ»-eo vllo
that the witness said he did not care to
repeat them. Charles H- Reudington, Al
exander H. Ma.ct>onald and William
Frank Taylor all corroborated Nicholas
T. Smith and gave further facts regard
ing the violence of Mrs. Smith's actions
when she called at the Southern Pacific
offices.
In reviewing- the case Judge X>alngÂ«rfleld
paid that although the plaintiff was en
titled to a divorce, which he would grant,
he felt that at this time it would not be
right to reduce Mrs. Smith's alimony al
lowance granted her by Judge Hebbard
in the maintenance case and he would
allow it to stand as then ordered, 5100 a
month, payable oa the 15th of every
month. This order was made to hold for
6ix months only, at the expiration of
wnlch time Mre. Smith will be called upon
to present her reasons -why the order
should be continued in force.
Foshay Walker, attorney for the plain
tiff, objected to a continuance, and after
consideration Judge Daingerfleld ordered
the hearing to proceed. Smith was re
called and after explaining a few points
on redirect examination corroborating
witnesses were summoned to testify.
Fred C. Peters, manager of the rooming
house at 30 Post street, was called. He
testified that in Febiuarv, 1S3S. Mrs.
Smith and her son called at his place and
asked to see Mr. Smith, who was rooming
there at that time. Together mothe- and
son went to Smith's room. The attention
of the witness was finally attracted by
the sounds of disturbar.ee and he hurriel
to Smith's apartments. On arriving there.
he testified, he found that young Smith
had knocked his father down and was
holding him on the floor, while Mrs. Smith
plied a bia.cksnake and '"between blows
called upon her son to gouge his father's
eyes out." Peters further testified that
he took a. hand in the affray and ordered
Mrs. Smith and her son from the build
ing. In conclusion he t*stifled that he be
lieved the police took Mrs. Smith and her
eon into custody after they left the room
ing-house.
Josephine Smith, attorney in proprla
persona, has lost her first case. Charles
H. Smith, cashier of the Southern Pa
cific Company, was granted a decree of
absolute divorce from his wife by Judge
Dair.gerfleld yesterday on the ground of
extreme cruelty. The disregard for the
rules of practice which characterized
Mrs. Smith's conduct of her own defense
throughout the trial marked Its close.
"When the case was called yesterday
inornirg Mrs. Smith was not present. A.
letter In her handwriting was handed to
the court, however, in which she suggest
ed the propriety cf a continuance until
Borne time in 1301. She was unable to
continue her labors as cross-examiner
and, furthermore, her preparations to put
on her defense vrcre not complete. Hence
to her. she stated, a continuance would be
of benefit.

A SINGLE MAN
It la presumable that Governor Gage
sought the advice of Attorney General
Ford before he appointed Justice Kerri
gan's successor. It is quite well known
that Cali'ornia'a Governor andt-San Fran
cisco's Mayor are not of the same mind'
politically, but It Is hardly conceivable
that the Governor would deliberately take
a political plum belonging to the Mayor
and bestow it on Mr. Long without con
sulting the Attorney General as to the
legality of the. proceeding.
When all the facts are presented It 'will
be found no doubt that the Governor
asked the law department of the common
wealth If he had the power to appoint,.'
and that Attorney General Ford hastened
to Inform the executive in writing: that
such power was lodged In the executive
department. It is known that the social
relations existing between the Governor
and the Attorney General are strained,
but the official relations between the two.
thanks to the admirable tact of Private
Secretary Foley, are most delightfully
preserved in manuscript.
It must be that the Governor has the
power to appoint. It cannot be that he
intended to give Percy V. Long a gold
brick on Christmas eve. It Is true that
the brave and genial Colonel Chadbonrna
once received a gilded testimonial from,
the executive office, but It was ndt placed
in his stocking on Christmas eve.
Justice Cook, however, is not sure that
the Governor has power to fill the vacancy
created by Justice Kerrigan's resignation.
He inclines to the belief that the Mayor
and Beard of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco are authorized to fill the vacancy.
The Mayor thought it advisable to ap
point Loner, as there is some doubt wheth
er the State law or the charter governs
in the election of Justices of the Peace.
The point will be decided In a suit which
Justice of the Peace Cook has brought
to retain his office. Kerrigan was elected
Superior Judge for the unexpired term
and his resignation will . permit him to ,
Qualify for the office.
If the courts determine that the term
of a Justice of the Peace la four years,
the Justices chosen at the last election.
will not take office until two years hence.
Whatever the outcome of the litigation
may be. Percy V. Long will be safe, as ha
is elected for a full term and appointed
to fill an unexpired term. â¢ *Â¦--:"
Justice of the Peace Frank H. Kerri
gan resigmed his ofllce yesterday. Kerri
gan filed his resignation with, the Gover
nor and Mayor Phelan and the former
immediately issued a commission to Percy
V. Long for the unexpired term. The
Mayor later in the day also issued a com
mission to Long and he assumed the office
immediately. Long -was elected Justice
of the Peace at the last election and thus
has about two weeks tacked on to his
regular term. 7
