CONCORD, N. H.. Dec. 27.â Mrs. Carrie
Sinclair Huntoon, the former society belle
who was arrested last nlpht on a charge
of -conspiracy to Â¦ kill her divorced .hus
band. Walter C. Huntoon. whs to-day
pronounced Insane. She will be taken to
Â«n asvlum. .
On thÂ« island of'Mlnicol, on the Malabar
coast, the Ttrfna was Kat on February It, 1W.
about 1 o'clock in the morning. Owing to thÂ«
The yacht- waÂ» well constructed by Captain
Turner of San Francisco at Benicfa, and I
know that she was stanch, for I aaw every
piece of wood that went Into her. She was
luxuriously furnished, commodious and a fine
sailer. My wife's, family all saw the yacht
before we tet sail on her and they never ob
jected to her as a place of abode for my wl'fe.
Though we always slept ashore when the op
portunity afforded, it was not because the
Tolna was not safe ar.d comfortable. Often
we stayed at night on the vessel when we were
visiting the South Sea islands.* for they wera
too wild and dangerous t/6 admit of our re
maining on shore over night with safety.
From the story of nls parting with ht3
wife and his public denial that she had
sued him for divorce Count Festetlc*
drifts Into a warm defense of his yacht
and concludes with a dramatic descrip
tion of the- loss of the little vessel. Ha
shows some elation over the fact that he
cheated the savages of the Malabar coast
out of the enjoyment of hla vessel after
their refusal' to aid him In gettln* her
afloat after she struck a reef. His de
fense of the vessel is for the purpose of
proving that Countess Festetics and her
relatives had none and could have no
objection to the Tolna. her fittings or her
seaworthiness. His description of the
loss of the vessel has the object of prov
lngr that even though had Countess Fes
tetics been aboard her life would not
have been endangered and to establish his
contention that It was not lack o;
strength of the vessel's beams but lack
of skill on the) part of mariners that tock
the Tolna to her doom. He says:
Praises His Yacht.
From tho li-Jt two lettrrs written by my wlf,Â»
after our jrart'n* at Singapore -I fully expected
her to r-turr. to me. After the third Wt-r.
which 1 .rccived at Pert :*.i-.J, > sus-pscie*
that there was something , the matter. LÂ»sa
than a fortnight after, leaving Port Said I
arrived at Trieste and I wu astounded to re>i.l
in the newspapers that my .wife was s-ek'r.g
a divorce, which I did not oc'teve to be 'h*
case and publicly denied.
â¢ I never remained away from the Tolna over
night, leaving the plaintiff on the yacht. I
did not remain away from the yacht at any
place except with my wife. When I left Sing
apore my wife in no manner objected or dis
approved of my departing without her. After
receiving the money from her father by tele
graph she spent the Interval of the four or five
days before I. nailed in carefully packing up
her belongings. She not only used all the
trunks she had on board, but bought several
large chests, and when all were- filled had them
taken to Mr. Bond, who was to ship them else
where for my wife. We lunched the day of
my sailing with the Austrian Consul. Mr. Bond,
and then with him we went to the Tolna. My
wife and Mr. Bond came on board the Tolna
for a short time Just before the yacht weighed
anchor. My wife and Mr. Bond then descended
to the launch and I also went down, where
my wife and I kissed and parted in th? prÂ»Â»
ence of Mr. Bond. Our parting was afTection
ate. but my wife in no manner whatever ob
jected or disapproved of my departing without
her.
a Urge apartment, 90 Avenue de Jena, In Tarts,
which I occupied before my marriage. This
apartment was beautifully fitted up with nty
own furniture and fittings. Beside* I had
there my own horses and carriage?. This whole
establishment was sold out in ISOj. aa,I coukl
no longer pay the rent.
In reply tg my wife's request to live on land,
I sj.td: "If your people give me the amount
that they promised, as' you" know, before our
marriageâ that is a 'million francsâ then I can
gtve'np the yachting and live where you like
on shore." My reason for keeping up mjr
yachting life so long, besides my lore for the
sea, was that I was always waiting for the
payment of the money which the parents of my
wife promised me before my marriage with
their daughter. They promised that I should
have it at the time of the marriage, but it
was never given me, although they continued
to i romise that I should have It later. I only
had .money enough myself to own the yacht,
and could not afford to keep an establishment
on land, too, especially as my wife was rather
lav sh In her expenditures. If I had the means
it would have been a pleasure to roe to have
had a house on land and to keep the Tolna
as a raclnz yacht.
I cannot state the exact money furnished by
me to the plaintiff for her maintenance and
support from the time of our marriage until
May. ' 190CC but the amount was about 15O.C0O
guldens, i some $60,0001 If I had been alone I
should have lived on my Income, as I did
before my marriage, but the amount Just speci
fied I drew from my capital at various times
to cover the demands of my wife for money.
Between April 20, 1833. and the commence
ment of this action. May 17. 19C0. I gave the
plaintiff no money: first, because she had re
cel\ed a large credit from her father; second,
because she did not'ask me for any, and third,
because she was living with her parents, who
were supposed -to*. be wealthy. â¢ Wntil we ar

T|-^y UDOLPH, COUNT FESTETICS
|_0J DE TOLNA. is in truculent mbo'd;
jf^T md in defense of his own has as-
the honor of his wife, Ella.
Countess Festetics de Tolna. So
ciety, the maids and matrons thereof, let
fall a word of pity as Countess Festetics'
story of all the wrongs, all the cruelties
she had suffered at the hands of her ti
tled husband was unfolded before them
while she proceeded to prosecute her case
in the divorce, court. . Now, society ex
pectantly nwaits the court's decision, for
Count Festetics, in a deposition signed by
him under oath, charges that it was his
wife's unseemly conduct with, a British
naval officer that led to the parting cf
their ways. .j,-;; Â¦".'â¢Â¦ .. ... . . . -.
Count Festetics in his deposition draws,
to say the least, an interesting pen pic
ture of one Remington of Her. Majesty's
ship Immortalite, revived from a "faint-:
ing spell" by a smash on the skull, with
a whisky bottle, leaping from a downy
couch provided, he avers, by "Countess
Festetics, with ' coverlets fronr her own
bed, then over the side of the Tolna into
the gig and away from the wrath of the
outraged Austrian : noblemanâ the depo
nent. â¢? This "big flirtation" is described
in detail: others are casually referred to.
And again Count Festetics makes de
fense of his "cruelty" in keeping-.his. wife
aboard the Tolna by charging her par
ents with willful breach of contract; One
million francs was to have been his from
the Haggin coffers in return for the value
cf his heart and hand,, he alleges. >He
took the offer in good faith. He- married
Miss Haggin at New . York City many
years ago. He Is still without that million
francs, and because poverty kept him
afloat, because it awakened him from his
dream of villas and impelled him to turn a
deaf ear to' his wife's'. importunities and
pleadings for a merry life' ashore, he sees
no reason why it should furnish her a
ground for divorce. And his poverty. This
he declares is due to his lavish expendi
tures upon his wife and'her lavish expen
ditures upon herself. Her action for di
vorce, he concludes, is based upon the
froth of discontent, born without cause
or reason. Her separation from him was
her, own fault, he charges. Hence he asks
that a decree of divorce be denied her;
that even though apart she will hence
forth be known, as In the past, as his
wife. ' .
The Count's Accusations.
The Count's story, as told In his deposi
tion, is as follows: f
During our stay at Singapore the plaintiff ob
jected to staying, any longrer on the . yacht
Tolna after a quarrel that we had' about -a
big flirtation that my wife had with a man
named Remington of, the English man-of-war
Immortalite. My wife .would give no reason
for her objection. to staying any lonicer on the
yacht Tolna except that she was tired of liv

CAPE TOWN, Dec. 27.-Martial law has
been proclaimed in the districts of Beau
fort "West and Carnarvon.
The Evening Standard to-day says it
understands that the squadron of yeo
manry which, as announced in a dispatch
from Cape Town yesterday, was entrap
ped and captured by the Boers, whom
they were following from BreStstown, was
released after the men had been relieved
of their horses and other equipment. Ten
of the yeomanry, the paper adds, were
wounded.
A dispatch from Vryberg, dated Decem
ber K*. says that Boers In considerable
numbers were making a movement west
ward. They had 150 wagons. The dis
patches suggest that they were trekking
to Damaraland, although the Beers them
selves denied any such intention.
Queen Victoria, it is said, has approved
the proposal to institute a new order of
knichthood to reward officers who have
served In South Africa. The order will
proiiablr be called the Star of Africa.
It Is questionable whether Lord Kitche
ner's proclamation will have much effect
until Dewet has been captured. The Boers
are likely to regard it as a sign of weak
ness and to have a wholesome dread of
vengeance if they surrender. The proc
lamation is approved, by - the party at
home that favors conciliatory terms to
the Boers as a step In the right direction.
Lord Kitchener reports an astonishing
number of attacks by Boers upon British
detachments and garrisons, each of
which, according to his official dispatches,
was repulsed. All Northern Cape Colony
appears to be aflame.

BOSTON, Dec. 27.â The Boston police
have evidence to indicate that "Pat
Crowe" and the other man who is wanted
on a charge of kidnaping young Cudahy
are on the Watten Hner Michigan bounl
for Liverpool and a ~able containing that
information has been sent to the Scotland
Yard detectives, who will be on the Liv
erpool docks when the steamer arrives.
Just before the Michigan sailed' last
Saturday two men, who acted so suspi
ciously as to attract attention and who
answered to the dowrijttions of Â¦ Crowe
and the supposed kltinaper, boarded the
steamer with a large amount of baggage.
The steamer sailed In a short time, but
not before word of the presence of '.he
stranger? had been tent to police'head
quarters.
OMAHA, Dec. 27.â All hope of 'captur- j
Ing Pat Crowe in this vicinity has bean
abandoned and. the police and special .If:- :
tectives on the caso have now settled
down to a systematic search for evidence
from the clews in their possession. These
clews are few, but mar load to important
discoveries. The offlctis , arcgoins ov*r
the entire ground covered by the bandits
on Tuesday and Wednesday nights of last
week in the hope thai they will find at
least two articles of evidenceâ the gaso
line stove, on which the outlaws boiled
, their coffee in . the â¢ Grr.ver-street cottage
and the buggy used by them at various
stages of the case. ,
"Up to date we have followed all clew*
which promised a solution of the mys
tery," said Chief Donahue to-night, "and
have found that they Jed : to nothing and
we are now ready/ to Â¦ yo 'over the ground
again, this time giving attention to more
minute details of the matter." '
Logically St. Joseph, the police think, is
the last city in the Middle West that Pat
Crowe would' visit at â¢such a time as this.-
So far as the police know Crowe has no
relatives in or near St. Joseph, but it Is
well known that he has friends there.
One development in theca3e is the. fact
that the man who rented the cottage on
Grover street gave the name of J.D, Con
nor. Crowe has a brother-in-law named
J.'-F:, Connor and these working' on the
matter are more inclined to believe, ; in
view of this fact, that Crowe rented 'tha
house.
DES MOINES, ;, Dec, 27.â Detective
Shaughnessy of Omaha arrived in the city
this morning looking for traces of Pat
Crowe, who occupied the, residence at lol'.j
East" Lyon street here for; some time.
Crowe is said to have been intimate with
Charles Price, who was shot. dead while
trying to; nob a store lnQuincy, 111., a
year .ago. The -detective believes that
Mrs. . Price, widow of the' dead robber,
will locate Crowe. He does not credit the
report x that Crowe is In J&ll at Laramle,
for he was seen in Omaha only a few days
before the abduction!

inal, who is being sought by the police all ;
over the United States oa the charge that j
he was the kidnaper of Eddie Cudahy at '
Omaha, has been seen in Chiragro within
the last few days and rasy rti'l be hld!r.g
hftre, according to statements made to- !
night by Detective Sergeant James Storen j
of the Chicago poiii-e. who ,has arrested;
Crowe a number of times- Jn the past. â¢
With a view to discovering the fugitive's !
hiding place, a search warrant of several 'â¢
houses in Sixty-third street, near Stewait 1
avenue, has b<Â»en made by Storen, acting j
on Information' that Crowe had been ree- \
ognized on that street on Christmas day.
In pursuing his quest the sergeant stum- |
bled upon evidence which he con- !
vlnced him that Crowe had been in Chi- !
cago recently, and that in the Rulse of a
woman, clothed in a black robe and heav- i
lly veiled, the suspect went abroad with j
impunity in the streets of Englewood, the i
suburb where he once was a resident and j
is well known to many people. . j
Storcn claim? to have traced Crowe to a J
room where hÂ«i was masquerading as a J
young- widow in mourning, but that Crowe j
received warning from his friends that the
police were on nls trail and escaped before
a capture could be effected.
"I found ample evidence in the room
that its occupant was none other than
Crowe," said Sergeant . Storen .to-night.

to settle the difficulty and the police with

and a bullet whistled by his head. This
seemed a signal for a fusillade from dif

coat to get hia own revolver. However
two bullets struck him, and as he fell a
third found lodgment In his body. In the
excitement after the first shot three men
had appeared, the Chief recognizing them

Mrs Milltr was allowed to see the boy

was ttken to the hctel by his governess.
Mrs. Miller called a carriage. The gov
erness objected to having the boy leave
her side, as the had been warned that an
attempt to kidnap him might be made.
Mrs. Miller said nhe was only going out
for a drive, but the girl insisted on going
along. The carriage was ordered to be
driven to the Union station. The gov
erness sprang out and telephoned the
father of the child to come to the sta

were unable to find any trace of the cab
man, George Z. Senour, until early this
morning, wnen he was found at his home.
He said he was ordered to drive to the
Massachusetts avenue station, after going
to the Union station. At Massachusetts
avenue Mrs./Miller seemed to change her
mind and ordered him to go on to Bright
wood. At this 6tatlon It was ascertained
that the train which Mrs. Miller had
counted on taking had gone. Senour left
her at Twenty-fifth street, contracting
with a liveryman to take her to Law

NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â New York's
swell set, first limited by the late
."Ward McAllister to the famous
"400" and pruned later by an
other social autocrat to "150,"
has been cut down to a poor "100." Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.'s taper hand is
the one that did the work, taking occasion
in issuing invitations to a dinner dance at
Sherry's for January 4 to limit her guests
to that number. This Is taken by some
to mean that Fhe does not consider the
others In it. while some are of the opinion
that the lady is merely ventlnp her spite
on the other Vanderbilts, who did not re
ceive her with open arms on the occasion
of her marriage. She makes one excep

INVADING TROOPS
MEET WITH DEFEAT
General TJribe Defeated by the Colom
bian Regulars at Corazel in
WEST," POINT. Nv ;Y., Dee. 27.â There
was an unusually large attendance of
.spectators at . the ' military court of In
quiry to-day. Horace C. Booz, a civil en
gineer of Buffalo, and P. O. Phillips of
East Cleveland, who. was heralded as a
Congressman, but who told the press rep
resentatlves that he was never elected to
Congress, were the chief witnesses. The
former's testimony was principally a ref
utation of the statements made about his
brother^ former Cadet Oscar L. Booz of
Bristol,' Pa,, who died recently. Several
of .'the .cadet witnesses during the prog
ress of the investigation had accused Booz
"of having shown cowardice in his light
with- Cadet -Keller- in August, 1S98, and
theyjalso accused him of untruthfulness.
Lieutenant Coe, instructor of mathe
matics. ,ln' his testimony last woek- stated
that Booz was not possessed of sufficient
mental capacity to â¢ pass the necessary ex
amination at this academy. The brother
said to-day that this was not so,- as the
manner In which the former cadet had
passed.' his Â¦ examinations at the prepara
tbryvschool. at Bustleton, Pa,, was suffi
cient; to prove that Oscar was possessed
of -iuraclent intellect. He said Oscar was
not-untruthful, arid he was anything but
a coward. -
Â¦' Mr. * Phillips' principal reason for ap
pearing before the court was to show that
he had not visited the academy in 1S98 for
the .purpose of saving his. son from being
r hazed.' .
. ''One: of the witnesses at the morning
session Informed the court that he had
setn Cadet â¢ Breth. so far exhausted from
severe exercising 'that stimulants had to
be given him in his tent In 1897.
It; was learned after, the court .had ad
journed that: Horace Booz had not volun
teered 1 his" testimony. He was summoned
by the court. -
Cadet Willis ' G. Peace of North Caro
lina, of the first class, was the first wit
ness to-day. He saw former cadet Breth
hazed in . 1897. The: witness, after being
frequently asked to describe the forms
of hazing to which Breth was subjected,
replied: >Â¦ ;..
. I .think they were -the usual forms, such as
holding out Indian clubs until It became tlre
soinr. .Irving "Wou.lrii vvllhv" and outer (hiUKS
which were In vogue'at that time. Breth was a
very awkward man and did not Beem to be able
to do anything right. He was subject to ner
vousness and was easily rattled. I got a letter
from Breth about six months after he left here.
In" It 'be 'tried to explain his difficulty in doing
things .right while at the post here, and said
that =he had been suffering from sickness all
the tlme;he was In camp. He had' hoped to get
better In. barracks, but did not. /
Q. â Is there any. hatred or feeling In exist
ence between first class and fourth class men?
A.â I don't believe there is any feeling on the
part of the first claps against the fourth class
men, but there may be on the part of the fourth
class men -against the upper class. This may
be accounted for by the treatment of the lower
class men, but this feeling passes away when
the cadets are advanced to the third class.
Peace went on to say that he did not
consider "exercising" brutal.
Q. â Then you don't think that being required
to exert yourself physic ally against your will al
most to the point of exhaustion Is brutal? A.â
I wasexerclsed myself, sir, and I did not think
it was brutal. It was uncomfortable, but I
never, knew it to result in permanent lnSury.
The. witness said there were some men
who used to haze more than others, and
that some of them seemed to be without
the faculty of judging when a man had
enough.; .
<'I.i should say that if a. cadet were hazed to
such a. degree that he would be injured or had
to'- be- helped by his fellows the hazing would
bfe.Jttrptal. 7V/','!-~.
Â¦.'This answer was .given after General
Bates had intimated .to the witness that
in case a cadet died from the effects o*
such hazing the. law would hold all of
those who took part) in it responsible for
the man's death.
Cadet Allen C. Kaye of Minnesota, who
came next, said he had seen Cadet Breth
the night before he left the Academy.
1 Breth seemed very 'much , cast down at
being deficient. He did not complain of
illness, nor did he say anything of hfs
treatment by the cadets while here. In
reply to General Brooke, the witness sa4d
he had never hazed, a man beyond tho
limit of his endurance; he never saw a
man faint or become exhausted from haz
ing, and had not heard of such a case.
Q.â Do you think it is for the physical benefit
of a cadet to have him "eatled" seventy
times? A.â Yes, sir; I should say It is. I'dld
it myself and I think It benefited me.
.Cadet John M. Pearson of Tennessee,
when asked if he ever hazed Cadet Booz,
answered In the negative. In describing
several forms of exercising he said:
Choo-chootngr Is the most exhausting. The
man Is required to get down and use his legs
as 'rapidly as possible in propelling himself
over the rround.
The next witness was R. C.Booz, civil
engineer, of Buffalo, a brother of the late
Cadet Oscar Booz. The witness had not
seen hisÂ» brother during the time he was
In the West Point Academy in 1898. Mr.
Booz continued:
. I received a letter from him shortly after he
went to -the academy. In it he said he felt
finnijc at the place as It was his first ex
perience away from home. In the second let
ter, which I got about the beginning of August,
he told me he would be called out to fight in
about a week. He complalne'd of having had to
take" tabasco' sauce and suffered from a sons
throat in couEequonce. He claimed it was
forctd down his throat and he had to swallow
It or choke.' -
Q.â Have you got those letters? A.â I have
not, sir. Tdestroyed all the letters I got from
him while here. In other letters which I got
from him he complained of being hazed and
nald he was being treated more severely than
others. loiter in the year he wrote to ma sug
gesting that my. father allow him to send In his
resignation. Oscar was. not "fresh" and was
not the kind of- a boy that would be hazed. .
Â¦ I Q. â Did- he ever mention any names of the
".men who hazed him? A.â No: he. did not.
Continuing, the witness said he objected
to Oscar's leaving the academy.
Mr. Booz then said he wished to vindi
cate his brother's character In the face
of published reports of what had been
said by Lieutenant Col as to his dullness
and deficiency in studies. He said Oscar
had completed. his preliminary studies in
such a manner as to prove that he was
not dull. , Statements had been made as
to his brother's untruthfulness and cow
ardice.
. "He was neither, said the witness
sternly. â
* In reply to Superintendent Mills, tho
witness said he had two brothers and one
sister dead. He- did^not know of Oscar
suffering from. - any other disease than
tuberculosis, if which he. died. Witness
said -that- In 1899 Oscar, had told him that
tabasco sauce had been forced down â¢, hia
throat. :. - : - . 4 â¢ .
Q.â Did you see' your, brother within six
months after leaving the academy? â¢ A.â I saw
him in October and December. He. then com
plained of a sore throat. He waa being treated
by aphyslclan In Bristol. 'Pa.: .'Â¦*
O âWhy did . you not you, or some member of
vour family notify the War Department or the
Military Academy''' when It -became apparent
that our brother was dying from alleged cru
elty ? A.â I suppose we did .not. feel like doing
bo. We were all very much overcome at Oscar's
approaching death..; .,...' . C.
'Cadet Henry A. Meyer of -Arkansas was
called. â¢ v . ,
Q.â Did you ever haze Booz? A.â I may have
braced him, "but I can't say positively. x^ngS
Q.â Did you: ever 'brace fourth class men for
the amusement or the edification of yourself or
class fellows? A. â N'o, sir. . I did it for. their
own*good. When. I was a fourth class man I
heard some upper class men turn*into the'next
tent. I went there late^ and found Cadet
Breth, lying on. the floor and no one else in the
tent. He was working his arms up and down
' nervously. . I i asked him what was the matter.
He. replied. .'â¢I've been exercising." Then Â¦ he
began working Ms legs. He seemed perfectly
rational, as he ; anÂ»wered my. questions. I felt
then that he was : only pretending and ' came
away, leaving him there. ; The tent was dark,
the only light-being that ; . which came in from
the company . street. f .^
P.- O. Phillips of Cleveland said that on

about ten days,: uurlng,* which time he
lived at Highland Falls.-: He came for the

Coirt;i-|
PARIS, Dec 27.â It has been disclosed
at the trial of the suit of Charles Wer
thelmer, bric-a-brac dealer, against Count
Bonl d* Castellan*, that Miss Ralen
Gould, sister of the Countess, has loaned
the latter $600,000 to tide the De Castel
lane family over the financial difficulties
with which they arc now and for sonic
time past have been beset.
Whether this Is the only gift made by
Miss Gould to her sister has not been
adduced by the proceedings, but there 13
indubitable evidence of the gift of $ti00,0C0.
During the last six years the Castellanea
have spent about H.000,000, and according
to the statement of their advocate. Maltre
Bonnet, they still owe 24,000,00) francsâ
nearly J3.000.000.
A verdict will not be riven for a fort
night. Lawyers believe the court will ap
point experts to examine the Count's pur
chases of Wertheimer'a stock.
MM. Foucault and Guerin. counsel for
Wertheimer. say they have not yet de
cided whether they will prosecute Count
Bonl In the criminal court. ,

Notice Is hereby given that a ro-
ward of SoOO will be paid for in-
formation leading to the arrest
and conviction o? parties who ma-

tric Light and Power Company.
When* a patient comes to mÂ« complain-
ing of dull headaches, sour stomach, bad
taste, nervousness, belching of gas. or
heart trouble, which is generally caused
from indigestion, I tell him to take one or
two of Stuart's Tablets after each meal
and as often during the day as he has
any trouble, and I feel confident I have
given that patient the best advice I could
give."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are large
pleasant tasting lozenges, containing dias-
tase and pepsin, combined with fruit and
vegetable essences. They are not cathar-
tic and do not act on any particular organ
like ordinary drugs, but Pimply act en-
tirely on the food eaten. They are a nat-
ural digestive, pure and simple.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are- sold by
druggists at 50 cents per package through-
out the United States, Canada and Great
Britain.
They have little appetite, and If they
do have an appetite, the food they eat
does them no good. "Why? Because it l=i
but half digested, causing thin blocd.
weak nerves, sleeplessness, aching bone?.
pains in chest, formation of gases, belch-
Ingr. etc They tell me they believe they
have consumption, or heart disease, rheu-
matism, nervous prostration, in fact mosr
every disease but the right onp.
In reality, the whole trouble is In thÂ«
stomach and nowhere else. Now what do
I do with such people? I don't feed them
on pre-digested foods like babies, nor
"stomach bitters," nor patemt nostrums
which I know nothing aboat No honor-
able physician will prescribe a remedy
unless he knows what it contains and its
probable effects.
For all such patients I hava but one
prescription, I advise them to go to the
nearest drug store and get & BO-cent box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I use them
with remarkable success In all cases of
indigestion and stomach trouble, becausa
I know what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
consist of and what they will do. They
contain the vegetable essences, diastasa
and government test pepsin, which are the
things every weak stomach lacks to re-
store natural digestive vigor, and If * I
had dyspepsia myself It is the one remedy
I should take.
The wise, up-to-date, modern doctor la
no longer tied down to the hard and fast
rules of what his medical books say he
shall use and what he may withhold in
treating his patient.
The successful doctor nowadays Is the>
one who is quick to avail himself of any
remedy, new or old. which holds out a
chance of cure no matter whether it Is
Allopathic. Homeopathic or neither one.
Dr. Jennlson, In an interesting article
on lndigestltlon and dyspepsia says:
"Nine-tenths of all people, who apply tr>
me for advice and treatment think they
have this aliment "or that ailment, but r
find on close examination that their whole
trouble arises from poor digestion.

Pete Coleman and "Sailor" Bharkey
slugged each other for five rounds to a'
draw. The crowd- wanted Coleman to
win and he strove hard to carry out their
good wishes, but the alleged marine was
too powerful. Mike 1 Curtain made short
work of Jack Niles.
"Kid" Morris, a tall and lanky youth,
created some merriment when he entered
the ring, but when he dropped to the can
vas without being hit the spectators were
convulsed with laughter. He .explained
that he had entered the ring to size his
opponent up. Having done so to his own
satisfaction he retired In disgrace.
The old familiar saying that "blood is
thicker than water" was partially dis
proved last night during the boxing en
tertainment given In the gymnasium of
the San Francisco Athletic Club. Two
first cousins, room mates, fought the
main event of the evening, and the way
they slammed and battered each other
would create a doubt In the mind of a
psychologist.
Billy Snailham and Joseph Brodshaw
furnished this interesting study. As rela
tives and chums they liave boxed. As
neither could gain any ascendency over
[he other they decided to test their prow
ess in the ring. At a previous exhibition
oTthVclub the lads fought such a fierce
battle that the judges were unable to de
cide the winner. They were rematched,
and when they came together in the
closing bout of last evening they wasted
no time for preliminary sparring. They
dashed into eacn other and swung their
arms like flails. Science was thrown to
the winds and they slugged each other
unmercifully. Young Snailham showed
to better advantage and gained a slight
lead. He landed harder and oftener, and
in the middle of the fourth round he sent
his relative to the floor with a left swing.
When the round closed Brodshaw was
covered with blood but still full of fight.
Sr.ailham was given the decision.
Joe "Welch, the "Mission ekeeter, stung
Charles "SVitzel so hard In the first round
of their fight that Referee Greggalna
humanely stopped It and gave the medal
to the former. Welch fights at 113
pounds, and he Is yet to meet a lad who
can mike him seek cover. I
Jack Cordell, alias "The Farmer," was
awarded a decision over Dick Rleger
after four rounds of fairly good boxing.
Jack Archie and Hughey Priel are still
unable to prove which is the superior
fighter. At the last exhibition of the club
both lads fought five rounds to a' draw,
and last night after battling six fierce
rounds the Judges were unable to agree.
Archie blocked well and fought with a
pretty style, but hia auburn-headed op
ponent made up for his lack of knowledge
of the game by his willingness and stiff
punches. Frlel's proboscis shed carmine
in quantity, but the young fellow did not
seem to mind his loss. The spectators
were greatly pleased with the lads' show-
Ing and cheered them lustily.
Jack Lundy and Jack O Brien fought
four fast rounds to a draw. lÂ»undy had
a shade the better of the argument, but
as O'Brien had done some good execu
tion and was fighting hard at the close
of the fourth round, the Judges called for
another. Lundy sulked in his corner and
refused to continue, and the referee had
to decide the bout a draw. .

A HARD BATTLE
CHICAGO, Dec. tf.-Dan A. Stuart, the
Texas sport promoter, who successfully
brought off the Fitzsimmons-Corbett fight
at Carson City after he had been sup
pressed by an extraordinary session of
the Texas Legislature after Congress had
outlawed fights in the Territories, passed
through Chicago to-night en route to Car
eon City.
It is known Stuart has another fight
carnival bee In his bonnet, but he was
conservative and would not commit him
self on this point. He was asked:
"Stuart, your mission to Carson City
means what?"
"Well," replied the sport, "It might
mean almost anything. Anything from
corraling a bag of birds to holding up the
overland limited."
"Is is not your purpose," pressed the
reporter, "to arrange matters for another
big fight carnival?"
"Perhaps I might be induced to take an
interest in almoBt anything if there were
a chance to turn over a few humble dol
lars. But, to answering positively one way
or another, you'll have to excuse me "
Since the repeal of the Horton law* in
New York, the passing of Alderman Pat
terson's resolution in Chicago, the rinjr
fatality In Philadelphia and other ob
stacles placed in the path of fighters
throughout tire United States, to say
nothing of the hazards which beset the
Cincinnati situation. Stuart appears to
hold the key to the situation and that his
purpose in going to Nevada Is to brinÂ«c
off another carnival of top-notchers is
considered v to be probable.

Frpm all appearances little Jack Martin
bas "done and flown de coop." In other
words, the feather-weight rider, dissat
lailed with longer staying In the employ
of Carruthers &. Shields, has run away.
He was treated very nicely by the firm.
and no reason can be ascribed for his
euddea eight. Alex Shields thought he
might be in Oakland, but a horseman ex
pressed the opinion yesterday that a
telegram sent to Toronto would catch
Jack. Still the little fellow was very
fond of hunting and may have gone in
quest of some birds.
O'Connor did not rido a very brainy
race on Parmenion. There seemed to be
no reason for his getting pocketed on the
back stretch.

Track Notes.
Ten maiden two-year-olds faced the
barrier in the final number. Tola, from
Pat Dunne's stable, looked about due, but
In a drive lost the decision to Slap Dash,
ridden by Bullman. The winner was
backed from 5 to 3.
Little Dominick on Morinel, rode an al
most perfect race in the mile and a quar
ter event, finishing in front of some very
fair ones In 2:07 flat. The little mare's
odds were played from 5 to 2 to Â» to 5,
t: â¢: after La. ii^rgia had "elinqnlEhed the
lead, Â¦won out from Owensboro. S't
Hclla started for the first time, making a
very fair showing.
Unable to beat some maidens the pre
ceding day, MacGyle defeated a moder
ate bunch of jilaters in the mile purse
run. Frank Doss' Parmenion had first
call at is to 5, but did not meet with the
best of racing luck, finishing Becond to
the Elmwood farm representative, which
led from the jump. Spike, a CO to 1 shot,
ridden by Jituart, ran third.
After many trials. Opponent finally took
a purse. Jimmy CofTcy's h<">rj>e with S7
pounds up looked unbeatable for the
opening mile and a sixteenth run, and
closed a 6 to 5 favorite, lie won "on the
bit" from Walkenshaw, which horse
seems iated not to earn brackets. Tho
chow felt to Free Lance, just about as
the horses had been played in the ring.
As an outcome of the Incident Dominick
beat the bunch away with Bard of Avon,
leading: to within forty yards of the wire,
where Mounce pot up with Articulate,
winning by a neck. The winner, carrying
103 pounds and <Vs to 1 in the betting, cov
ered the six furlongs in l:12Vz, and has al
ready been voted a colt far better than
the average. There was a heavy play on
Pat Dunne's Silurian, which was unable
to do better than get the show. Joe Frey
ran a race that would indicate he was far
from being in shape. There Â¦was inclined
to be come gossip because Just before the
horses left the paddock one or two books
"went up" on the price against Golden
Age. This is no unusual occurrence, and
there Is not the least doubt but that Bull
man wanted to get away from the post
as badly us those bettors who backed his
mount.
Only two favorites were able to land
purses. Opponent and Morinel. The warm,
balmy weather and excellent card attract
ed a large crowd.
The most surprising performance of the
afternoon was the capture of the hurdle
event, at one and three-fourths miles, by
May Boy. a 75 to 1 shot, piloted by Worth-
Jngton. The last time this same horse ap
peared In public he couldn't jump a straw
bond, but was a dream yesterday. Eva
Moe, with 12S pounds and Owens up, was
an even money choice. She never seemed
overburdened Â¦with speed, and had it not
been for an argument put up tjy Lomo,
the light weighted May Boy would have
waltzed in. As It was, he won by three
lengths in 3:21.

day, astride the crack colt Golden Age in

the misfortune to be left behind. It might
have been different and Bullman would
perhaps have missed the shower of hisses
lie received but for the fact that Bam
Hildreth's entry enjoyed the pleasure of
being a â¬ to 5 favorite. Starter "Dick"

with an invitation Issued by the Chamber
of Commerce of this city, a party of eight
legislators-elect arrived on last evening's
train and for the day have been the guests
of the. chamber.
The motive which prompted the latter
body to Issue the invitation aside from
that of hospitality was to have these
prospective lawmakers visit â¢ the State
Normal School, bo that they. might judge
of the needs of that Institution and the
appropriation which will be necessary to
cover them. ig^tp

chief topic of conversation, at San Quen

no w*ord has come from the missing man
or. any clew that will point to why or
where he went. To-day several experts
were examining his books, but this pro
ceeding is hardly watched, as it la taken
for granted that the books are straight.
Mrs. Walden, wife of the missing account
ant; visited, the prison to-day. She pro
fessed to be unable to throw any light
upon the mystery. The notoriety given
her husband's continued absence is very
distasteful to her. Her presence here re
futes the story that she also had disap
peared. As time .passes the affair la
thrown into deeper mystery. Time usually
brings forth some ; reason or clew. In
Walden's case conjectures fall to the
ground. .He remains a mystery. Seem
ingly contented, sober. Industrious, en-
Joying a good salary, almost a life posi
tion, with a, wife and home, Walden dis
appeared as though the earth had swal
lowed him.
The only circumstance that points to
contemplated flight Is the different state
ments that he is. alleged to have made to
people regarding where he was going dur
ing his. vacation. If true they show that
bis* absence is not the result of accident
or foul play. The snowed-in-the-moun
talns theory first advanced by his friends
has been abandoned as each day has made
it less probable> The great publicity
given his disappearance must hava
ieached him by this time if alive and In

" TACOMA, Dec 27.â A tragedy occurred
yesterday morning east of Olympia, re
sulting in the death of three children.
The Lavery family, consisting of the fath
er, mother, a daughter aged four years, a
son aged two years, and. an infant, six
months old, occupied the. dwelling h6use.
The father and mother went to take a
cow to a neighbor's house, leaving the
children alone. A hired man was at work
cufting wood about 200 yards from the
house. During uie absence of the parents
he discovered the house to be on flre. Be
fore he could reach the scene on explo
sion occurred, supposedly of some dyna
mite that had been stored In the upper
part of the building.
By the time he arrived and opened the
door the whole interior of the house waa
in Uames, and it was impossible to rescue
the little ones. The building was entirely
consumed, the walls falling outward. The
bodies of the two oldest children were
found where the Â¦ bedroom stood. They
had run out of the front room, Â¦where the
fire probably started. The Infant was evi
dently in the crib or cradle In the front
room. â¢
The parents were frantic with grief
when they arrived. Their absence had
been but a few minutes, yet long enough
to find their, house In ashes. The mother
had to be removed by force. She and her
husband later returned to the scene and
spent many hours gazing at the ruins of
their home and the remains of their chil
dren.
To-day at Olympia services were held
over the remains of Hazel, Dewey and
Robert, the three dead children. The bod
ies were so badly destroyed that only a
few bones could be found to place in. the
casket.
The fire left Mr. and Mrs. Lavery in a
destitute condition and a subscription pa
per is to-day being liberally signed by
State officials and other citizens.
No inquest was considered necessary,
although the origin of the fire will proba
bly always remain a mystery.

DIXON, Dec 27.â One of the mpst dis
astrous fires in the history of Dlxon broke
out in the Arcade Hotel on A street at
about 10:30 this morning. The wind was
blowing a gale from the north and that
any of the southern portion 6f the town
remains seems miraculous. A defective
flue is presumably responsible for the con
flagration, and after the fire broke
through the roof a few momenta after
smoke was first seen issuing from the
building It was evident that the building
could not be saved, and the volunteer
nre department devoted Its attention to
saving surrounding property. â¢
The Fashion stables. Arcade liverv sta
ble and Odd Fellows' Hall, all adjacent
to the destroyed building, were saved aft
er most desperate fighting on the part of
tne ,nre companies and others who volun
teered. While the hose companies which
compose the fire department were busy
fighting the flames willing hands were re
moving as much of the furniture as pos
sible from the burning building and about
,T4: e " fourtns of the contents were saved.
The hotel was erected in 1872, and was
one of the town's'oldest landmarks. It
escaped the fire which swept the busi
ness portion of Dixon In 1SS3, although it
was badly scorched, and has since had
peveral narrow escapes from destruction
by fire. The building was insured in two
companies for $5500, which only partially
covers the loss. The property represented
an outlay of nearly $25,000. â¢
Dixon, possessing only limited hotel ac
commodations, will- feel 'the loss of the
hostelry keenly. It is not known whether
or not Mrs. Kumle, the proprietress, will
reconstruct the building.
Firemen and Volunteers Save Furni
ture From the Burning Build
. Ing and Check Spread of
Flames.
Buchanan is a son of ex-Congressman
Buchanan of Georgia.
The crime for which Buchanan was con
victed was committed In 1894 in this city.
He arrived here shortly before and soon
developed a wayward character, spending
his remittances in carousals. While on
one of his sprees he tecame engaged In
a barroom quarrel, which resulted in ths
stabbing and death of William. H. Miles.
Buchanan claimed after his arrest that
he knew nothing of the affair and that
there was no premeditation about It. He
was bound over at a rreliminary hearing,
but before trial a special Jury found that
he was suffering from petit mal or
masked epilepsy" and he was commit-
Â« ed v. tO v Napa ' from which, after a hard
ngnt. Be was released some months ago
by the Supreme Court and was brought
here for trial for the killing of Miles.

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 27.â Chief of Po
lice Sullivan to-night received a telegram
from the Sheriff of Clare County. Mich
igan, requesting him to hold H. Green,
the man who walked Into the police sta
tion Christmas night and declared him
self guilty of the murder of "Bill" Feeney,
a logging foreman, near Farwell. in Clare
County, Michigan, about 'twenty-nvtt
years ago. Green has since refused to
talk, when Â¦ asked for a further state
ment to-day he said, sullenly:
"I have said enough; in fact I have said
too much already."
Efforts to get him to reduce his state
ment to writing, or to authenticate it un
der oath, have thus far failed. Chief Sul
livan asserts his belief that Green .is the
murderer who has been so long wanted in
Michigan, and that his original story,
which was told coherently and voluntar
ily, was correct In all important particu
lars. The Chief will hold him until he
has received full advices from the Mich
igan end. The telegram from the Mich
igan Sheriff follows:
HARRISON, Mich.. Dec. 27. 1900.
J. E. Sullivan, Chief of Police â Owen
Feeney was murdertd, his throat having
been cut. The body was found in a lake
three miles west or Farwell, Clare Coun
ty. He was missing January 7, 1877, and
the body was found in the following Sep
tember. Please get the confession of II.
Green in writing, sworn to before some
magistrate, and wire me at once. Andree
ana McCame were arrested and dis
charged for this crime. Hold Green until
further advice. .
JOHN R. BROWN, Sheriff.
The circumstances of the murder as de
scribed in the Sheriff's telegram agree
almost exactly with those narrated by
Green in bis confeaalon.
CLARE. Mich.. Dec. 27.â The man to
whose murder H. Green confessed in Sac
ramento was Owen Feeney, instead of
Bill Feeney, as Green states. Feeney was
in Clare on a spree January 8, 1877. and
displayed considerable money. He board
ed a train that night for the lumber camp
where he was employed and was never
seen again alive. Search was begun and
a hole was discovered in the ice on a
(â¢mail lake near the lumber camp, but the
body could not be found. The following
September Feeney's body was found in
this lake with the throat cut and the skull
fractured. His money was missing. This
tallies with Green's confession to the Sac
ramento-police*, as he told them that he
and his brother knocked Feeney In the
head and cut his throat. Green Is un
known in Clare.

let into his own head.' dying instantly.
The bullet that killed his wife entered the
left eye and penetrated the brain. She was
alive when picked up, but died on the way
to the Receiving-Hospital. \
.The couple were married at Van Buren,
Ark.,, In- January. Tinsley represented
himself as possessed of property in,
Helena. Mont.,, to the value of $75.00).' His
wife had $400 cash and a house and lou
in Jackson, Tenn., valued at $2500. This
latter her husband Induced her to sacrifice
for $1800, and five days after the marriage
they came to Los Angeles on a honey
moon trip, the expenses of which were
defrayed by Mrs..Tlnsley. 'From here they
went to Mineral Wells, Tex., and August
28 reached Excc-lslor Springs, Mo.
There Tinsley Induced his wife to trans
fer to him the $700 that remained of her
money and told her he must go to Helena
to settle up his affairs. After his depart
ure she found that he had also taken a
diamond ring and stud valued at $400. " ,
She received a telegram from him later
dated Los Angeles, in which he acknowl
edged that he had deceived her in regard
to his wealth and that she would see him
no more.
She followed him here, but in the mean
time he had departed for Moriett. Mo.
Two weeks later he returned to Los An
geles, and an arrangement was made
whereby he 'gave her a draft on an Ar
kansas bank for $325, and promised to
make other reparation. She sent the draft
for collection and it was returned, with
the statement that the money to Tinsley's
credit had been .withdrawn by telegraph.
On the 21st of this month Mrs. Tinsley
filed suit against her husband in the Su
perior Court to recover the $1100 fraudu
lently . obtained from her. and bitterness
over this suit and the troubles leading up
to it evidently caused the double tragedy
this morning.
It is now alleged that Tinsley had an
other wife in Townsend, Mont.
Letters found in Tinsley's pockets after
his death, addressed to the public ana
dated Christmas morning and this morn
ing, indicate clearly that the crime was
premeditated. In the course of the first he
says:
' "If I meet Mrs. Anna P. Tinsley to-day
I will take her life and then mine. If wo
cannot live together then we will die to
gether. Mrs. Tinsley has said a great deal
publicly through the press, in fact, too
much. I have nothing to say about our
dlfflcultles. The Lord must be the judge."
In the letter dated to-day he says:
"I expect to meet Mrs. T. at the Metho
dist Episcopal South to-morrow, and then
I will do the work. I hope no one will
say I am- crazy, for my mind Is as clear
as it ever was. I am only a little forget
ful. I am sound on religion. I have no
fear of hell or hopes of heaven. I would
like to be buried by the side of Anna P.
Tinsley."- . ....

der requested Daniel Kevane, secretary
cf the State Board of Examiners, to
craught the resignation in proper form,
to that he might sign it and tnus sever
his connection with the ottlce. The inci
dent was the culminating feature of the
conference of the State Board of Examin
ere this afternoon with the Governor and
the Debris Commissioner, held in the of
fice of the executive. There were also in
attendance the members of the Debris
Commission of the California Miners' As
sociation, of which ex-Congressman A.
Camineiti iÂ£ chairman.
The plane &e originally prepared con
templated the expenditure of $500,000 for
the impounding dams, of which the State
â¢was pledged to pay one-half and the Fed
eral Government one-half. It was eoon
found, however, that the work would cost
fome JSOO.OOO, and a hitch haa arisen as
to the State raising its additional pro rata
ef Il50,(i00.
The miners are very desirous that a
fii-rt Ehould be made in the matter, and
have urged the State Board of Examiners
to approve the plans at the JSOO.OOO figures,
eo that the necessary land may be pur
chased and the work got under way.
The Sta*e Board of Examiners' legal
province takes in only the appropriation
already made. Under the law it cannot
approve plans entailing the expenditure
of a greater 6Um. afid Governor Gage is
of the opinion that the Board of Examin
ers cannot sanction any plans which
Â¦would pledge the State to more than has
already been appropriated.
Upon the votes of Governor Ga^e and
Secretary of State Curry the plans and
specification* fo-rwsj-ded to thÂ« State
Board of Examiners and approved by thÂ«)
California Debris Commissioner, John F.
Kiddtr, were approved by the Board of
Examiners; provided, however, that such
Approval does not involve the expendi
ture on the part of the State of a sum
in excess of ?2oO,<XÂ«t, the amount already
appropriated for the purpose, and pro
vided, further, that la- the purchase of
any site or sites contemplated under the
act creating the office and denning tlia
mission of the. Debris Commissioner, the
approval of the State Board of Examin
ers must first be secured and that all
contracts let for the carrying out 6t the
purposes of the act must first be ap
proved by the State Bo&xd of Examiners
and that no warrant shall be drawn in ex
cesB of the amount appropriated by the
act.
Attorney General Ford declined to vote
on the resolution on the ground that he
Â¦was not satisfied as to the legality of
the action. There wa* no open evidence
of strained relations between the Gover
nor ar.d the Attorney General, but that
the one was not in perfect accord with the
ofher was apparent r>y the studied polite
ness which prevailed.
Governor 1 Gage at one time In the pro
ceedings eald that when the Debris Com-'
rnlssioner had prepared something for the
board to act upon it would be time enough
to consider it. Commissioner Kldder evi
dently did not like the Implied criticism
<^f his action and at the close of the meet
ir.g he asked that the Governor accept
his resignation. This the Governor re
fused to do unless it was presented in
writing. Mr. Kjdder then requested Sec
retary Kevane to write his resignaation
out so that he might attach his signature,
but before this could be done the meet
ing adjourned. Governor Gage, in con
versation afterward, ssid that he did not
mean to give the Debris Commissioner
offense.
The miners' committee to-night met and
eent a telegram on to Washington stat
ing the action taken at to-day's confer
ence and urging the California delegation
to secure an additional appropriation of
IlSO.Of'O. assuring- the delegation that the
committee would bend every effort to
have the California Legislature appropri
ate a similar sum, and thus allow the
impounding dams on the Yuba River to
be built according to the approved plans.

brary- periodical room, became suddenly
ill yesterday morning on a Geary street
car. She was taken to a Hamilton square
drugstore, but nothing could be done for
her, and a littlo time after she passed
away. The primary cause Is thought to
have been heart disease,. but internal in
juries may have existed, caused by a lall
from a car which she suffered three
months since.
Mrs. Folger, who was u widow, was. on
her way to work at the library when sho
died. For some days she had been,com
plaining of not feeling 1 well, but treated
her condition as being not serious. At the
time she fell from the car Mrs. Folger's
only apparent injury was a fracture of
the arm, which, however, soon healed,
and the case was compromised with the
railroad company for a small sum.
In educational and literary circles Mrs.
Folger was well known. Naturally talent
ed, well read and gifted with an indom
itable energy,. she filled her part at the
library with peculiar fitness, and her loss
will be one severely felt. Mrs. Folger was
a pioneer teacher In Sacramento and had
been connected with the library' for eight
years, five of which had been spent as aa
elstant librarian of the Richmond Library
She resided at 911 Point Lobos avenue!

Death came suddenly yesterday upon
William Koch, a laborer, visiting at *Â»

William L. Garrison, an expressman re
siding at 2818 Harrison street, had a nar

Garrison, with a companion, was driv
ing two horses and when his wagon was
directly on the railroad tracks the gate
keeper. Jerry Murphy, rang the warning
bell and lowered the gates. Garrison was
thus penned In on the track and could
neither go forward nor retreat.
â¢ The whistle of a special southbound
train was heard in the distance, and ere
the two men could reach a place of safety
the engine of. the train struck their wa
gon with terrific force. Garrison's com
panion made a jump for the ground just
before the wagon was struck, but Gar
rison was not bo fortunate. Wagon,
horses and driver were hurled a distance
cf twenty-five feet, striking the ground
clear of the tracks, but in perilous prox
imity to the wheels of the passing train.
The engineer of the train did not wait
to see the result of the collision, but con
tinued on his way. Garrison's companion
and Gate-keeper Murphy hastened to the
assistance of the injured man and found
him In an unconscious state. A telephone
message was sent to the f Seventeenth
street police station and the patrol wa
pon was soon on the spot. Police Officer

AGED FROG-CATCHER DIES.
Had Lived for Twenty Years on Sand
Dunes.
Amedee Naval, an aged Frenchman,
whose hut with that of a fellow recluse
named C. C. Langven has stood for more
than twenty years on the sand dunes
about a mile north of Lake Merced, died
some time during Wednesday night, his
body being discovered at noon yesterday
by his partner when the latter . went to
rouse him to go about their business of
frog catching, which was the only sup
port they had. Langven walked across
the sandhills to the Ingleslde House, from
which place the Morgue was notified.
Deputies Smith and Meehan drove the
wagon and declare had it not been for
the guidance of Mounted Policeman G. J.
Hayes they would never have "reached
their destination, roads being an unknown
quantity in the sandhill country- As It
was, the trip took them about ten hours.
The hut where the old man lived and
died was bare of even the necessaries of
existence, the chief article of furniture
being a barrel In which the frogs were
kept pending their removal. Absolutely
nothing was found by the deputies which
would give the least clew to the old man's
reasons for leading his lonely life. Lang
ven, his hermit neighbor, was deeply
grieved at the death of his companion in
loneliness, and bitterly reproached the
fate that left him friendless. Beyond say
ing that Naval was a widower he threw
no light on the past of the dead man.

Upon finding the body Moe notified the
officers of the Morgue, and the remains
were removed to that institution. In a
pocketbook on the deceased were stamp
photos of three women, all young and
pretty, and unknown. His pocketbook
also contained a clipping bearing the
death notice of his mother, who died on
January 17 last.
Feeney left his work at Nolan's two
weeks ago, early in the day. He did not
say whÂ»re he was going nor did he ask
for the salary which- was due him. The
dead man was unmarried and was in his
youth.
B-â EING out of work, deserted on
that account by his father and
penniless, E. L. Clapp, president
of the local Uabor Council, a na
tive of Vermont and a clever mu
sician, turned on the gas in his room at
the Van Ness House, 1S12 Market street,
some time, it is thought, on Sunday night.
He was not found until . yesterday morn
ing, when George Sanee, a painter em
pioyed to paint the roof, smelt the gas,
and the door having been broken open
Clapp was found dead on the bed, evi
dently having been there some days.
Clapp had taken the civil service exam
inations and was number 51 on the eligi
ble list for copyists. He worked for some
little time in the Recorder's office, but
on account of his intemperate habits was
discharged about three months ago.' His
father, who until then had been' sup
ported by his son, then sought a home
with his daughter in Rutland, Vt. Clapp,
whose musical abilities were marked, ob
tained a position in the orchestra of the
Alhambra Theater. His love for drink,
however, lost him this work also. The
last time he was seen by his landlady
was on Sunday night, when he spoke of
his loneliness and depression. Dailv pa
pers found outside his door dating "from
Monday morning point to the fact that
he took his life on the night preceding.
Little of value was found in the rooms,
and the suicide left no note to tell why
he. had sought the other shore. His fath
er's absence,, however, is said by those
who knew him to have weighed on his
mind.' He had carefully prepared for
death, having plugged up the keyhole and
stuffed some holes in the partition: The
remains will be taken in charge by the
Musicians'. Union. -
THREE MEN WHO FOUND LIFE'S BURDEN TOO HEAVY TO SUPPORT AND, SEEKING FREEDOM FROM THE
YOKE. SOUGHT DEATH BY WATER. BULLET AND GAS, HELPING TO SWELL THE LIST OF THOSE WHO
WOULD GO OUT WITH THE CENTURY.
The State; Board of Harbor Commis
sioners met yesterday afternoon fn regu
lar session and a number of important

provements on the water front.
President Kilburn was in the chair and
Commissioners Harney and Ilerold were
also present. Chief Engineer Howard
Holmes. Chief Wharfinger Percy Hender
son and Secretary William English were
present at the meeting.
The most important work transacted at
the meeting was the opening of bids and
the awarding o' contracts for the supply
of cement and the preserving of the piling
of the new wharves from the ravages of
the teredo. A contract was also let for
the erection of a new freight building for
the Santa Fe Railroad, to be located near
the Lombard-street Â¦wharf.
Tlrree bids were put In for the contract
for preserving the piles of the proposed
ferry slips to be built north of Lomioard
stroet dock, for. the use of freight, boats
of the various railroad companies. The
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany, the Paraffine Paint Company and
H. R. Rood & Co. were the bidders. After
the bids were opened the Commissioners
went into executive session for a half
hour and then announced the awards as
follows: The Paraffine Paint Company,
491 piles, cn the basis of 32M: cents per
lineal foot for actual portions treated by
the coating 'process; H. R. Rood & Co,,
491 piles, to be treated by the "pile per
fection preservative," at 40 cents per
lineal foot for actual portions coated; the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany. 10S5 piles, to be injected with ten
pound injection, at 27 to 41 cents, for piles
ranging from twelve to sixteen inches
square. The total amount of the bids
awarded for preserving piles is $33,000.
President Kilburn announced that the
contractors to whom the bids had been
awarded would be expected to live up to
the penalty clause, and that the Commis
sioners -would exact the penaltv for non
fulnllmcnt of the time clause set in the
contracts. Â»
H. M. Newhall was awarded the con
tract for supplying cement, the amount of
the contract being $22,170. The successful
bid was made at the rate of $12 32 per ton
of 2000 pounds. J. D. Spreckels & Bros.
Co. put in a bid at $14 10 per ton and W.
R. Grace & Co. also bid for the contract,
their price being $13 22 per ton."
Six bids were put in for the erection of
the Santa Fe freight building, the con
tract being awarded to Newsom & McNeil
for $5850.
On the report of the chief engineer the
board ordered the following bills paid for
work completed: San Francisco Street
Improvement Company. $4650 35, for piles
driven on the Steuart-street wharf;
Thomas Egan. for laying tracks on the
sea wall, lots 5 and 6. $1323 25; Hyd^ Con
struction Company, for piling at the Sec
ond-street wharf, $2510 20. The pay roll for
December, amounting to $10,569 50, was
also passed and ordered paid.
Major Long of the United States trans
port service sent a letter to the board
asking that the transport dock at Steuart
street be lengthened fifty feet In addition
to the proposed 200 feet. The matter was
referred to the chief engineer of the board.
The' Merchants' Transportation Com
pany applied for berth room at Jackson
street wharf for their new steamer, which
is to ply on the Sacramento and San Joa
quln rivers. Chief Wharfinger Henderson
was requested to find the desired-accom
modation.
Williams. Dimohd & Co. complained
that they had been charged half-dockage
rates for their thlp Shenandoah for eight
days, when the rate should have been one
quarter. This matter was referred to the
chief wharfinger. ?
It was ordered by the board that the
south side of Lombard-street wharf, now
used for berthing the ferry-boat Uklah,
be placed in condition to accommodate
deep water vessels, owing to the crowded
state of the water front.
Albert Raymond appeared before the
board as assignee of the sub-contractors
who worked for Contractor Wilkle on the
new postofflce building on the water front.
Wilkle failed and his creditors had Ray
mond appointed as assignee to represent
them. Ex-Governor Budd. attorney for
the board, advised that Raymond should
get a "payment authorization" from Wil
kie before the Commissioners could order
a settlement of the account.
It is the Intention of the Harbor Com
missioners to use the rooms vacated in
the ferry buiHlnp by the postofflce de
partment as offices for the Western Union
and Postal Telegraph companies, the Pull
man Palace Sleeping Car Company and
Postal Inspectors Erwin and Monro.
Chief Wharfinger Henderson reported
that the fog bell on Lombard-street wharf

Action Taken In Executive Session
and Three Commissioners Re
fuse to Give B-easons for
Their Decision.
' 1
The scheme, to establish a system of
licensing Chinese ramblers will not be
put Into execution. Last night the Police
Commissioners met in executive cession
and after a brief discussion of the subject
tiiey put their seal of disapproval on It
by instructing Chief of Police Sullivan to
"eaforce all the- laws and ordinances of
the city and county, ard also of the State,
naming to rambling." TLis virtually set
tles the proposition to license, the earn- I
bier* of Chinatown. !
After the rneÂ«tlns: the Commissioners.
oÂ«yocd announcing their action, refused
to discuss the subject.
?"1 have nothing to say," remarked the
Jiex. "I have received my orders and
intend to follow item. You will have
to eee the Commissioners for further In
formation."
Before formal action was taken in the
matter of licensing: the Chinese gamblers
the following communication from the
Young Men's Christian Association was
received:
To the President of the Board of Polioe Com
nlsElorier* of the City and County of San Fran
ciscoâCear Sir: Permit mÂ« personally to com
mend rcu and your associates on the Board of
Polloe Commissioners for v.hat you have al
ready ccne, and to request and urge you to
contlsue the good work and to minimize to the
utoacst extent the evils of cpen saloons, dls-
reputable resorts, corner groceries, poolroom?,
f-i-r-.b-- - houses and otfcÂ«T demoralizing' games
e.r.<S devices The following resolution was
nuanljti'.iusiy a4<?r^3 by us and a copy vu or
dered sent to your honorable body:
"Wher*"&s. The Board of Police Commis

liiercfore lxÂ» il

them to continue the Rood work to the extent
of cloetr.e poolrooms and all gambling: houses
Â«nd banithinit the nicke!-ln-the-slot machines
and all similar devices.
Resolved. That we hereby guarantee the hon
orable Board of Police Commissioners and the
Police Department of this city our heartiest
co-cperation along tlie UdÂ«s indicated above.
ROLL.i V. WATT, President.
H. J. McCOY, General Secretary.
Just tvbat weight the communication
had in bringing about the conclusion not
to license gambling 5n Chinatown the
Commissioners refused to say.
"We thouerht it advisable not to adept
the proposition to allow the Chinese to"
run their games without police interfer
? ;'!Â¦Â«Â¦, " remarked President Newhall. "and
That is all there is to it. The police in
Chinatown will watch the Chinese gam
blers just as they have been doing, and
if necessary to preserve the law the Chief,
will double the squad ihat is now doing
duty In that delectable quarter."
It is authoritatively said that Commis
sioner "Wallace advised his fellow mem
bera of the board not to adopt the scheme,
as it was clearly in violation of the State
law on gambling.
The Thalia, a resort at the junction
of Market and Turk streets, will be al
lotted to run for thrÂ«Â»e months more. The
proprietor of the t>lace asked for a re
n*>w;tl o? his license, which was granted j
after rf'iiskiprablr discussion, on his prom
!Â«-Â¦ io prevent objectionable females from
vtsitir-K ihc- resort, and also on the prom

Thq breaking up of great landed estates by legislation*
would be a novelty in Great Britain, though, it has
been accomplished in Australia, in New Zealand and
in Prince Edward Island. Different means were
resorted to. by each of the different colonies, and in
neither of them was t!: a programme of action cxactlv
For an understanding of the full . significance "of
that declaration it is to be borne in mind that Russell
is in close relations to the present Ministry. H e has
served under Lord Salisbury as Parliamentary Secre
tary for the Irish Local Government Board, and has
been always counted on as a stanch supporter of
British conservatism in Ireland? By reason of that
fact his speech is taken to mean a good deal more
than an individual opinion. It has even been .sug
gested that possibly several members of the present
Cabinet agree with him, and that a compulsory land
purchase act for Ireland may be among the measures
brought forward by the Government at the coming
session.
In the recent speech at Antrim Mr. Russell is re
ported to have proclaimed himself a stronger Union
ist than ever, and to be utterly opposed to those who
are agitating for the separation' of Ireland from the
rest of the kingdom; but he went on to say he is not
now and never has been a Unionist "for the purpose
of maintaining an unjust and ruinous land system
that is paralyzing everything in the country and
wearing out the lives of the people in a hopeless
struggle."
ONE of the political surprises in British politics
. is the recent announcement of Thomas W.
Russell, a Unionist member of Parliament
from Tyrone, in favor of a scheme of relief for /Ire
land that in its way is quite as radical as anything
advocated by the extreme Irish party. Mr. Russell
proposes that the Government buy out the landed
proprietors, and then sell the land in small tracts or
farms to the present occupiers. It is a plan to put
an end to the big estates of the past and to establish
iii Ireland that system Â«of peasant proprietorship
.that prevails in France.

Such is the tale that comes of the way in which
justice is working out its revenge despite ; the offi

is another demonstration that after 'all 'this is a moral
universe, and that in the long run evil does not yield
anything but evil. The fate of the officers who were
most conspicuous in their efforts to destroy Drey
fus has been terrible. Cuignet died in prison and
Henry committed suicide to save himsett from prison.
Esterhazy was supposed to have escaped from danger
and to have gained at least security from want for the
rest of his life. Now comes this story of his wretch
edness and his misery, physical and moral. It is evi
dent the, amnesty r of Governments is not recognized
as valid in the great courts of natural justice.
It appears that since his flight to England Ester
hazy has sunk lower and lower in poverty as well as
in disgrace and shame. In his squalid misery he has
turned to his wife for help, and is reported to have
written to, her a letter in the course of which he says:
"I; have been unable to write to my children re
cently, not having the money to buy a postage stamp.
I am at the last extremity of strength, courage and
resources. I have not eaten for two days, until this
morning in the. workhouse. I have no clothes, am
shivering with cold, and am compelled to warm my
self by entering churches and museums."
It happens, however, that justice has a way of
working out its laws through those revenges which
Shakespeare says "are brought by the "whirligig of
time." France has extended her amnesty to all con
cerned in the scandal 2nd the crime;. the French peo
ple have shown a willingness to forget if not forgive,
and it is the Christmas season, when even the most
iriiserable can draw something of consolation from
the promises of Him whose birth the holiday cele
brates; and yet in this very time joi good humor, if
not of happiness, there comes like a cry from the
depths of utter despair a wail from that Major Ester
hazy who was one of the bitterest of the enemies
of Dreyfus.
SHORTLY before the holidays the French Gov
ernment adopted the amnesty bill, which was
designed by the Ministry to put an end to the
Dreyfus affair, not by doing justice, but by dismiss
ing the whole thing and letting the good and the
evil pass away together. It was a case of letting the
"dead past bury its dead," and from the standpoint
of political expediency was perhaps the best thing to
be done.

boiling water and boiled to a thin paste;
one-half pound of powdered Spanish whit

It is, then, fairly certain other criminals will be
tempted to intimate the kidnaping of young Cudahy.
There is at present i<i this State no law of sufficient
force cither to deter or to punish. Let us have the
detect in our Penal Code remedied as promptly as
the Legislature can act.
The issue, we repeat, is on? of urgent importance.
It :s well known that criminals arc very subject to
'"suggestive" influences. A notorious crime com
mitted in one part of the country is almost sure to
be followed by simikr crimes elsewhere. For ex
ample, when the case of one woman killing another
by sending poisoned candy through the mails was
reported, there followed several cases of the same
kind, not only in different parts of this country, but
cvrti in Great Britain. In fact, in one British case it
was brought out in the trial that the crime had been
committed without any other cause than the sugges
tion of it to a weak and vicious mini In that case
the person poisoned was an inmate of a poorhouse
who had not an enemy nor a friend in the world, and
absolutely nothing was to be gained by the murder.
The criminal had merely pondered over the crime
committed in this city, had come to the conclusion it
could be easily and safely done, and thereupon had
proceeded to act upon the thought.
American life has hitherto been free and easy for
a!! classes. Our Presidents have not had to go
abroad attended by guards, and the children of our
richest millionaires have been able to go about the
directs to and from school and to 'visit the
lÂ»arks and playgrounds with as much freedom,
fiom danger as the children of ordinary citi
7ens. If abduction go unpunished, however,
there will soon be little safety for the child of
a rich man unless he be guarded every time he leaves
home. To treat kidnapers leniently will be in the
future as foolish as it would be to treat lightly a man
who should assault the President. With the increase.
of our population we have developed many of the
criminal tendencies of the Old World, and we must
against them with all the force and vigor of
American law.
A portion of that <lemand, however, cannot be car
ried out. As was pointed out by The Call yesterday
in a review of the subject generally the law. against
::i)duction in this country is not stringent enough
to Â«.!cal fittingly with such offenders as those who ab
tmct persons for the purpose of extorting ransom.
We return to a consideration of the Vubject to-day
for the purpose of emphasizing lhat point. In view
vi the tumulus given to kidnaping by the success
of the criminals in Omaha it is imperative that our
Legislature act promptly in amending our law in this
icspect by providing adequate penalties for the com
mission of such ofie-ists.
WHEN Mr. Cudahy of Omaha paid $25,000 for
the release of l;is son from the hands of kid
napers he did what was a perfectly natural act;
but at the same time he gave to the criminals an
encouragement in their crime which will probably
lead to the commission of similar offenses against
other families. That tuch will be one of the first
cficcts oi his action is so clear it has been everywhere
recognized, and in all parts of the country there is
:-.o.v an urgent demand that the evil be counteracted
;.> far as possible by the relentless pursuit of the kiO
rapers until they be caught and properly punished.

EDITOR CALL: As a patriotic Callfornian of thirty-five years' standing I
take much interest in the rising generation. Now "nine-tenths of men are what
they are by their education." At least Locke said so. Thus It happens that I
like to frequent conventions where our teachers most do congregate and pick
up educational novelties. Sometimes I run across one. I did so this morning in
the English section of the State Teachers' meeting. Professor Burk of the San
Francisco Normal School laid down as an educational axiom that "emotion"
was to be the ruling power In life; that neither intellect nor will, nor will guided
by Intellect was to control in love, or war, or religion, or apparently even in
our schools.

Berkeley, December 27, 1900.
EDITOR CALL.: Kindly permit me a few remarks in regard to prizes and med
als for pupils of schools. People with most excellent' intentions offer prizes to
children. Many earnest educators who love the young people see this tendency
with -deep regret. -Prizes beget low and materialistic motives and lead to vying
and base competition, to overtaxing the mental powers. The noblest children
often do not participate in this kind of lower ambition and prize winners do
not,, generally speaking, I am convinced, render society the best services when
they go out into the world, where unselfish devotion to high causes, frequently
left unrewarded, should be the guiding star.
- â¢ If -people wish to offer assistance to real education let them help poor and
honest scholars to pay their way through school; let them provide school libra
ries and laboratories with the necessary outfits and thus do a permanent, un
questionable good to all concerned. It is my firm belief that school authorities
should not encourage this evil connected with the giving of prizes and medals.
The true teacher will always know how to hold out a high and noble motive
to the children under his charge. Very respectfully.

Mr. Chauncey Depew,
'Tis sad, but 'tis true,
That Minister Wu
Is taking your cue,
And soon wiil have two â
His own and the one
He has taken from you.
That was the way the world looked to a newspaper
man when the century began; and looking back upon
the time even from this distance we can perceive that
the view was essentially accurate. There could be no
doubt about France fighting all. That was evident
enough* in the thunder of .Napoleon's guns and the
marching of his restless armies all over Europe. That
Britain was paying for all was a matter of common
fame. Her money was poured out like water to raise
and equip armies to resist the march of the conqueror.
Russia's threatening attitude was not so notable theu
as it is now,, but none the less the threat was there.
Prussia in 1800 was humbugging herself more than
any one else, as we know, since the weakness of her
show of power was revealed a few years later at Jena,
but of course the Boston man could not foresee that
astounding battle that crushed a nation at a single
blow. . Switzerland was not being plundered exactly
in those days, but Napoleon was taking almost any
thing of hers that; he coveted. Spain was actually
doing nothing in any line of endeavor either of peace
or war ui that year, but she had to rouse herself a
little later. Just why the "Germany" of that time
should have been suspected of thinking itself "all in
all" is not clear. It bad been overrun j>y Napoleon
and had nothing to boast of in war, but probably the
Boston man referred to its high intellectual preten
sions in the domain of philosophy and literature.
Finally, the spoliation of the United States by all
was indisputable. Both the British and^ the French
deemed our commerce and anything else they could
lay their hands on to be their rightful prey. In the
end we had to fight the British to protect our sailors
from being dragged off our ships upon the high seas
whenever the British chose. -
In that year the population: of the nations is esti
mated to have stood thus:
Russia 38.140,000
France ; 27,720.000
Germany 22,330,000
Austria .; 21,230,000
United Kingdom ......../ 15,570,000
Italy 13,380,000
Spain 10,440,000
United States 5,310,000
Since those days the world has changed. France
no longer fights, Britain is not' paying for all, and, in
fact, has come to us to get a loan to pay her own war
bills. Prussia has been swallowed up in Germany and
has no longer any international importance. Switzer
land is not being plundered. The United States is
not being spoliated. In one land only has there been
no change. Spain is still "doing nothing."
At the present time the population of the powers
is estimated as follows:
Russia 130,896.62$
United States 76,295,220
Germany 53,000,000
Austria-Hungary 42,660,906
Great Britain 40.559.954
France 38.517.375
Italy 31,000,000
Spain ..- 18,250,000
Such are the national results of the changes of the
century. No single nation is. -now strong enough to
fight all, or pay all, or threaten all, or even to deem
itself all in all, and that fact may be counted among
the good things the century has brought.

France fights all.
Britain pays all. >

The Metric System.
The United States was the first nation
to adopt the characteristic feature of the
metric system, namely, the decimal divi

failure to take up the decimal measure
ments of weight and space, and clinging
to the arbitrary and complicated stand
ards of quarts, pecks, gallons and yards,
we have lagged far behind the rest of the
world. There is no doubt that the extra
time spent in calculating by the old sya

calculations of the metric system,
amounts to a seriou3 total in the labors
of this nation.â PITTSBURG DISPATCH.

Principles of Democracy.
What the Â«x-Presldcnt says about tho
fundamental principles of Democracy, as
expounded by Jefferson, and the fathers,
may be accented. But the Democratic
party has no monopoly of pure democrat
ic doctrine. Mr. Cleveland and his asso
ciates show an apparent desire to appro
priate the principles of Lincoln. They are
good principles, too. But the trouble with
the Democratic party now, as at almost
any time during the last half of the cen
tury, has been that it persistently graft*
upon the pure Democratic stock a Tot of
business-disturbing issues In the attempt
to rally the discontented In all walks Â«>f

is cause for Mr. Cleveland's criticism, but

And to plunge and sail In ?he sea.
So runs the song in commemoration of

MINISTER WU TAKES
A CUE FROM DEPEW
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that in this
case, so far from there being any justification of eva
sive tactics, there is not even an excuse for it. The
Legislature will soon be in session, and if the law*
be prejudicial to public welfare a repeal or an amend
ment can be promptly obtained. To the Legislature,
therefore, the police authorities shouldkhave recou-st.
Let them present their programme on its merits.
Let them explain the benefits, they deem certain to re
sult from it, and then let them ask the Legislature
for authority to go forward with the plan. If that be
done the proposed policy can have a fair trial, but if
an attempt be made to enforce it by evasion it will
be doomed to failure from the, start, and to an igno
minious failure at that.
Whatever view may be taken of the general policy
of license and supervision as against the known de
fects of the present system or lack of system in deal
ing with vice, there can be but one view of the pro
posed evasion of the law. That is something which
cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. While
the law stands it must be obeyed. The obligation is
binding upon every citizen, and upon the officers of
the law the obligation rests with all the responsibility
of official duty and all the sacredness of an official
oath. Bad as affairs have been in San Francisco,
they will become- much worse if the custodians of the
law set an example of violating the statutes either
directly or indirectly.
Perceiving their inability to carry out their pur
posed programme by legal methods, the authorities
arc reported to be contemplating a means of effect
ing it by indirection and evasion. The plan is to have
the keepers of gambling dens, brothels and similar
places of vice arrested each month, to release them
on an amount of bail proportioned to the magnitude
of the place they maintain, have them forfeit the bail,
which will then pass ;nto the city treasury, and thus
obtain for themselves the privilege of carrying on
their trade under police supervision. The bail money
forfeited monthly will be equivalent to a license fee,
and virtually the licensing system will have been es
tablished. ' '- ~Â»r :,
It has been calculated that the revenue to be de
rived in that way would amount to something like
$100,000 annually, and that in addition there would
be the saving of a large expenditure now necessary
to control vice under the present plan.
Section 330 of the Penal Code, to which the section
quoted refers, forbids gambling games and the main
tenance of â¢ gambling ' places. So far, then, as
licensing gambling is concerned the policy now under
consideration by the police authorities is out of the
question.
Section 337 of the Penal 'Code says: "Every State,
county, city, city and county, town or township of
ficer, or other person who shall ask for, receive or
collect any money, or other valuable consideration,
either for his own or the public use, for and with the
understanding that he will aid, exempt or otherwise
assist any person from arrest or conviction for a vio
lation of section 330 of the Penal Code; or who shall
issue, deliver or cause to be delivered or given to any
person or persons any license, permit or other privi
lege, giving or pretending to give any authority or
right to any person or persons io carry on, conduct,
open or cause to be opened any game or games which
are forbidden or prohibited by section 330 of said
code; and any of such officer or officers who shall
vote for the passage of any ordinance or by-law giv
ing, granting or pretending to give or grant to' anv
person or persons any authority or privilege to open,
carry *bn, conduct, or cause to be opened, carried on

Whether such a policy would be good or bad in
this city is a question in the 1 ' general problem which
will have to be postponed until another is settled.
Under our laws no r-uch programme can be legally
carried out. It is indeed expressly forbidden.
It is claimed for this policy that it enables a muni
cipal government to control vices which it cannot
wholly suppress, and thus to destroy much of their
evil. It is argued that the plan will put an end to the
bribing of policemen, to blackmail, to the spread of
vile diseases, and drive put of the domain of vice it
self those who carry it to the extent of crime or to
loathsome excesses.
rOR some time past the police authorities have
been formulating for the control of vice a
policy not before practiced here but which has
been tried elsewhere with what are said to be good re
sults. The policy virtually consists in licensing places
where vices are practiced, thus rendering it more
profitable for them to operate under police super
vision than to carry' on the trade otherwise.

war in South Africa is all* over, but they, do not go

Lord Salisbury recently told the British people that
the welfare of the empire was more dependent upon
the proper housing of workingmen than upon foreign
wars; and accordingly 'it appears the old man occa

In many respects. Wonderful In the increased

realize that education is the most important
profession of mankind. Within this time has
occurred a great growth in the oneness of edu
cation. The one principle of the elevation of
craracter has developed: oneness in method:
or.eners in system. But also with this there
has occurred a vast differentiation In educa
tion. A school for the doctor, a school for the
If.wyÂ»i>i a school for the minister has been es
tablished. Also there has been a wonderful
enlargement, occurring In several fields. It

part of the eighteenth century," says Parkman.
"one sees the eastern shore- from Maine to
Georgia garnished with ten or twelve ooloreti
patches, very different In shape and size anu
more or leÂ«s distinctly defined."
First should be noticed the respective
claims of the two nations and the founda
tions upon which these claims rested.
The treaty of St. Germain (1632) had rec
ognized the French as In pdpsesslon of the
St. Lawrencrt and of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick, substantially as de
scribed at present on our maps. In 1637
Iberville had settled lower Louisiana.
The explorations of the French Jesuits
had given claim to the basin of the Mis
sissippi. To connect Canada and the
mouth of the St. Lawrence with Louis
iana and the mouth of the Mississippi by
a chain of forts along the inland lakes
and rivers was the French design. By
1700 this had been largely accomplished,
and it was supposed to guarantee French
possession. As for the English, they were
to be hemmed in east of the Alleghanles
on the Atlantic coast.
While this struggle for dominion In the
New World from 1690, when France seemed
so dominant, to 1783. when she finally re
tired from the continent of North Amer
ica, may be looked upon as a continuous
and single struggle to be studied as one
movement, it will still be necessary to re
gard the struggle and its outcome some
what In detail.
At the close of the seventeenth century
France was at the zenith of her power. It
was the age of Louis XIV. In a wonder
ful array of great names produced In a
half-century of that, exceptional reign
none stands hif,her for distinguished ser
vice to the state than the name of Col
bert. No Frenchman ever did mor,e for
the expansion and glory of Franc* than
Colbert. He was the great colonizer of
France. . Probably no other Continental
statesman, If we except Prince Henry of
Portugal, ever made colonization so dis
tinctly a part of his policy or had plans
so sagacious and far-sighted. Colbert in
creased the French navy within twenty
years (1660-1680) from thirty to 176 ships;
he saved from waste and corruption &),
000,000 of the revenue of France. Besides
urging a policy of peace^ and production
at home, he encouraged and sustained the
designs of Frontenac, MArquette, Jollet
an<\ La Salle for the upbuilding of New
France. It was largely through Colbert's
influence and statesmanship that the
French by 1690, besides their well ground
ed hopes for empire* In India and their
power in Cayenne and the West Indies,
had in North America. Canada. Cape Bre
ton, the fishing banks of Newfoundland,
the mouths of the Mississippi and the St.
Lawrence and inland Louisiana. France
held America by 'the mouths of Us great
rivers. With the English colonies mak
ing but a fringe on the coast, it might
well have been concluded by the reflective
historian of that day that America was
to become French.
(b) At the end of the period <17S*-1S15)
tha international strife arose from the
French revolutionary influences in the
danger to the balance of Europe from the
ambition and dominance of Napoleon.
Though we had achieved our political In
dependence at this period. It was with the
greatest difficulty that our neutrality wa3
maintained for a while, and. finally, in
spite of our oassion for peace, -we were
forced into conrlict with one of the Euro
pean combatants.
(c) But the great cause of this second
"Hundred Years' War," that lasted
throughout so much of the eighteenth
century, was the rivalry between France
and Britain for dominion beyond Europe,
especially in America. It is with this in
ternational strife for the control of ter
ritory in America that our present lesson
has to do.
(a) At the becr'nninr of the period (16SO.
1713) war came from the 'efforts of France
to upset the balance cf power in Europe.
Louis XIV was attempting to abolish the
Pyrenees by placing a Bourbon on the
throne of Spain, thus uniting the crowns
of France and Spain under one control.
â¢two nations were ccntinuously at war for
more than sixty years. There were, three
distinct causes for the century of strug
gle:
When William III came to the throne of
England (1688> and became involved In the
a flairs of Continental Europe because of his
opposition to the ambitions of Louis XIV
there began what has been called another
"Hundred Years' War" between England
and France. Beginning with King Wil
iiam's war in IKK), there was a protracted
struggle between these two nations, with
only Intel vars of interruption, untS! Wel
lington sheathed his sword at Waterloo
arid Napoleon had gone to St. Helena. In
that long period of more than 100 years,
while there were varying intervals cf
truce and breathing r.pells of peace, ihe

The causes of the Seven Years' "War,
eo far as America is concerned, have been
indicated by what has already been writ
ten. The outcome of the struggle la to be
seen by a study of the great treaty of
Paris of 1763. This treaty has been prop
erly pronounced the greatest treaty since
that at Westphalia (1<H$) established the
balance of modern Europe. It marks an
epoch In universal historyâ a turning .point
not only in the history of America"; but
in the history of the world. Of the war
which It closed. Green has said with sin
cere eloquence that "three of its many
victories determined for ages to come the
destinies of mankind. Quebec was ona
of these thre<Â» victories, arfd wtth Wolfe's
triumph at Quebec began the history o?
the United States." We can here but
briefly summarize the situation in which
this treaty left the territorial possessions
of the leading Eurouean states in Ame;
ica:
In 1739 began the Spanish warâ a war
that is but little noticed In our books and
that has almost passed out of the mem
ory of men. It is remembered now chief
ly by the story of Jenkins' ear. It aros#
over the disputed boundary of Spanish
Florida and the claims of the Spaniards
to tho right of search In the Spanish
main. Spain was protecting her legiti
mate trade monopoly with her colonies
by drastic processes, and Jenkins dis
played his severed ear In parliament aa
proof positive of such Spanish cruelty and
aggression as called for vengeance and
war. The war led to a war with Frances
Louisburg, captured by the New England
ers, was restored by the truce of 1743, and
the rival nations were facing one anoth
er for the final struggle.
3. The treaty of Utrecht declared tha
'Five Nations," the famous Indian con
federacy of New York, to bo subject to
the dominion of England. This gave r!sa
to stupendous English claims. Did this
dominion carry with it dominion over tha
Indian lands? The English insisted that
the allegiance of the five nations carried
not only the Indians' own hereditary ter
ritories, but also all the regions of Iro
quois conquests; that is, all west of thÂ«
Ottawa River and the Alleghanles to th*
Mississippi. This, of course, would break
through the heart of New France, and it
was a claim that could be admitted by
France only on the ground that she had
no possession In America that she could
hope to defend. BKS3B
Thus it will be seen that the treaty of
Utrecht, while it made some important
concessions in America, really after all
merely postponed the day of final settle
ment. The limits of Acadia. the boundary
line between French Canada and the Brit
ish colonies, and the boundary between,
these colonies and the great "West, were
all left unsettled. The attempt to settla
them was sure to rekindle war. The thir
ty years that followed, called "a genera
tion of chronic, smothered war." was a
period of dispute and preparation. First
there were disputes over the limits of Aca
dia. France had been left In undisputed
possession of CÂ», e Breton Island, and this
she now pr6ceeaed to use as the basis of
her operations for' the recovery of her
concessions. In the second place, there,
there was a difference over the northern
boundary of New England and the con
trol of tho Indian territory In that region.
The third and greatest question of all was
whether France or Great Britain should
hold the valleys of the Mississippi and the
Great Lakes, and with them the control
of the continent.' "This was the triple
problem," says Parkman, "that tormented
the northern English colonies for mora
than a generation, till it found its solution
in the Seven Years' War."
famous treaty of Paris. The treaties of
Rys-wick (16f)7> and Aix-la-Chapelle O"*>>
settled riQthinp. and they may therefora
bo regarded as mere truces in the con
flict. The conquests made in the two
wars preceding these treaties were r6
storcl, the wars brought nothing but
losses to both sides and the contending
powers were left confronting one another
with the great Issues between them still
unsettled.
But the student should lools upon th*Â»
treaties of ITtrecht tl713> and Paris (17Â«J)
as Important landmarks In the diplomatic
Mstory of America. By tho treaty of.
Ltrecht France made important conces
sions to Great Britain in America.
1. The British claim was recognized t->
the territory drained by the rivers flowtnjc
into Hudson Bay. This region of indefin
ite limit had been claimed by the British
since the explorations of Hudson in lÂ«S0.
-. Newfoundland and Acadia (N'nv.i
Scotia) "according: to Its ancient limits. "
including the fortress or Port Royal (cap
tured by the English in HÂ»>, restored in
lt*7. recaptured in 1710 and permanently
retained) were also conceded by tho
French. The "ancient limits" cf Acadia
were never defined. France contended
that the concession included not only
Aova Scoria, but a narrow strip on tho
seacoast. while England claimed from it
a vast country westward to the English
settlements in Maine and northward to
tne Bt. Lawrence.

CLOSING QUOTATIONS.
Wall Street and Europe.
A New Tcrk financial authority says: "It
begins to lock as though Wall street had estab
lished a permanent cliange in its relations
with the investment markets of England and
Germany. For a long time Europe has been
LFSurlnfr us how much more largely it would
ir.veFt tir.d speculate in cur securities provided
cur monetary systsm were securely planted
en the gold basis. We now see how much
Â»as ir.ievAet in this. The election was ac
cepted as ratifying the cct of Congress estab-
I!fh!r.g the gold basis cf value: and ever since
there has been an extraordinary increase in
both the speculative and investment transac
tions in Americans at London and Berlin. The
srbitra^e operations sinc-e the election have
r-eon rrtar.y times larger than the whole twelve
months' dealings for past years. This of course
ects as an important stimulus to our local
rrarket ; line it is an uncertain Influence and
ci.is to the perplexities of the New York Ex
rlantt; arA it is a ijuestion whether, in the
rvent cf money riÂ«ins on the European mar
ketx. t\Â» may not witness some considerable
r^alizinrs on profits by IÂ«ondon from Its present
If: re? holdings."
Trusts Confronted by Individuals.
According to tho following extract from the
NÂ«w York circular of Henry Clews the trust
problem is working out its own solution auto
matlrally. If what this financier says proves
true then the question of trusts will eventually
settlf itself without Congressional assistance:
"TherÂ«Â» is no Icnger any prospective strin
f<?nry in the local money market; on the con
trary, the Interest and dividend disbursements
â¢ f ;hp treasury and corporations and the re
turn of money Rent to the interior through the
tall rnT.ths will produce en easy money mar
ie t for the next three months. The evidences
Â«->f business activity ntjound on Â«very hand;
the condition of the crops holds out, at the
moment, the promise cf a good harvest; our
surplus of exportable staples and of manu
factured products keeps up the extraordinary
rate of increase tha.t has prevailed for the
last tlirc-e years; In fact, while the Imports
are kept, crmparatlvoly low our foreign ship
ments are all the time going ahead of our
most sanguine expectations. At the same time
the industrial interests have seen and meas
ured t!;Â» great 'trust' undertakings bom In the
last two or three years and are not alarmed
et thpm. They Â«ee plenty of room for invest
ment of tlicir own capitals and find nothing
to fear from the rp^cial powers and working
facilities from which the 'trusts* have Â«
pectM so mu<-h and of which they have boasted
H rriu-h. Tliey are equipping themselves with
the newest and best plant* and their capitals
ere equal to til the wants of economical work
ing. TliiF miry of independent industrialists
into thÂ« field ie taking place upon an entirely
rxtrar-rrHnary scale. anJ that Immediately upon
ih* crration of industrial consolidations cap
italized at K. 500,000,000. This settles the future
Ftatus of the trusts. It shows that they must
pi\ e up all pretensions to monopoly and bring
themselves to face a* formidable a competition
es thai which drove them to eeek ehelter under
the policy of consolidation. The really im
portant sij;nifii.-ance uf all this Is, however,
that this new reinforcement of independent in
(iuffit! organization inrfins a coming vast ex-
I Â«nÂ«lon of our manufacturing industries. Our
ever-growing; accumulations of capital can find
no othfr employment; and monopolies are mere
ten in th<> presence of such an overwhelming
force of free capital."

SAX FRANCISCO, Dec. 27â5 p. m.
The fottewtas are the seasonal rainfalls to

laft fason, and rainfalls In the last twenty
four hours:
argument^ which gains force from a lingering
fear of a possibility cf a money squeeze inci
dent to the early settlement, that the low
priced stocks are safer to bold on margin, aa
the margin represents In some cases nearly the
full value of the Etock. In addition to these
features of strength in to-day's market there
was an opening rush to buy People's Gas,
which made the price rise to 110, or 3 points
above last night's close. The stock reacted 2
pclnts and closed with a net gain of 1% on '
the strength of the reports of Vanderbllt ac
quirement of the stock. Sugar was very fever
ish over a wide range, rallying strongly after
ar> early decline and closing with a net gain
of 3%. St. Paul moved up in the late dealings
pretty near to 141. coming within less than a
point of Burlington.
Uneasiness over the money market was &gain
allayed by the abundant- offerings on call,
vhlch carried the rate down to 4 per cent In '
the late dealings. This was an influential fac
tor in. rallying the markpt and the bears, who ;
sold freely in the early trading, covered again
on a larpe scale before the close.
Business in bonds continued large and the ;
rcarket gained in strength as the day pro- '
cressed. Total sales, par value, $5,130,000.

CLOSING.
NEW YORK. Dec. 27.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram . says:
The markets here were fairly active to-day
after the holiday, being favorably affected by
the cheerful expectation of cheaper money In
the new year and the failure of the Bank of
England* to raise Its minimum discount rate,
which, however, caused no surprise.
American securities were less active than they
have been recently. London was disposed to
take profits, but New York hoisted prices again
and the close was at the best, while in the
street buoyancy prevailed. The official denial
of the reports of conversion of the Northern
Pacific preferred shares is not taken too se
riously here. It Is expected that the rumor
will be revived later. Both New York and
Montreal were credited with buying Canadia.11
Pacifies.
Paris caused a spurt of 1% in Tintos.
The bank lost Â£40,000 gold to India and Â£50.-
C00 to the Continent. Money was very firm
owing to end of tho year requirements and
the settlement. The bank did a large business
in discounts at 4 per cent and in loans at 4H
per cent. . *

Wlual Crop of 1900
WASHINGTON. Dec. 27.â The Statistician of
the Department of Agriculture estimated the
United States wheat crop of 1900 at 522,229,503
bushelf, the area actually harvested being 42,
435,385 acres, and the average yield per acre
12.29 bushels. The production of winter wheat
Is estimated at 330,025,490 bushels and that, of
spring wheat at' 172,204,096 bushels, the area
actually harvested being 26,23,1.897 acres In the
former case and 1S,2.">9,4S8 acres in the latter.
The winter wheat acreage totally abandoned
in Ohio, Michigan, In-liana and Illinois is
finally placed at 3,522,787 acres and the spring
wheat acreage totally abandoned in Xorth Da
kota and South Dakota at l,7S3,4t;T.
A comparison of the newly seeded acreage of
winter wheat with that of the fall of 1899
shows that of the eleven States and Territories
that sowed 1,000,000 acres or upward with win
ter wheat one year ago, Pennsylvania. Mis
souri. Kansas, California and Oklahoma report
an increase amounting to 971,704 acres, and
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Texas and
Tennessee a decrease of 1.7S0.791 acres. The
avt ragre condition of the crowing crop on De
cember 1 was S7.1 per cent of the normal.
There are many complaints of the Hessian fly,
but the low condition fcr Ohio, Michigan, Ken
tucky and Tennessee is fully offset by the
exceptionally hlph condition reported from
Kansas, Missouri, California, Oklahoma and
other States, in all of which It Is above nor
mal. . The production of corn in 1900 is esti
mated at 2,103,102,016 bushels; oats, S09.125.98J
bushels; barley, .53.925,853 bushels: rye. 23.995.
927 bushels: buckwheat, 9.566.966 bushels; pota
toes, 210,926,897 bushels, and hay, 50,110,906 tons.
The area from wh}ch the crops were gathered
was as follows, in acres: Corn, 83.320.S72; oats,
27.364,705: barley. 2,894,282: rye. 1.591.328; buck
wheat, 637,930; potatoes, .2.611,054, and hay, 39,
132,890. . Â¦
â¢ The. corn crop of 1900 was one of the a/our
largest ever gathered, while, the oat crop has
only once been exceeded. On the other hand,
the barley and rysf crops are the smallest, with
one exception. In each case, since' 1887; the
buckwheat crop is the smallest since 1SS3 and
the hay crop the - smallest with one exception
since 1888.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 27.â The market digested
an enormous amount of ttocka on proflt caking
to-day. These heavy offerings were not with
out pffert en prlccf, and in fact there was a
p< riod oÂ£ very peneral reaction, but like yes
terday the msrkft wain demonstrated its mar
velous r^curTutive power and the specu!a.tt\-e
et-thusiat-m was shifted into new quarters
where the buying v.as resumed v.Ith unabated

the movement of prices wan not wide at any
time ard the larjre volume of business was ac
complished without either making an inroad on

stocks the day's price range was very wide,
while the net change is quite important. In
this list were stock? which yielded sharply to
the profit taking movement and then recovered

PaciScs rrere examples. The distinguishing
feature of the day's trading was the devÂ»lop
n wit of aggressive strength in large groups of
lcwer-priced stocks, both ia the railroad and
n.iscellancous departments. The advance in.
Ijt-nver and RJo Grande common cave the cue
for this movement. The strength In the Rio
Grande etock and the large amount of the ab

cess had begun of transfusion of Interest be
tween railroad companies in teat region, look-
Ing to a settlement of obstinate rate problems,
pjmilar to the exchange of holdings which has
â¢â¢/â¢â¢purred between railroads in other regions.

Moran Brothers to Ctet the Contract
If They Will Reduce ThcJr
Bid. ' ..: V.K-
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.â Moran Broth
ers of Seattle will obtain the contract for
the construction of a sheathed battleship,
provided they are willing to reduce their
bid so that it will be within the limit of
the appropriation, and the Cramps will
build only two armored cruisers.
The Board of Construction to-day de
termined that the strict interpretation of
the law authorizing vessels required the
placing: of a contract for one of the three
sheathed battleships on the- Paclnc Coast.
The bid, of Moran Brothers - .was consid
ered more advantageous than any other
received from the Pacific slope. It was
decided to recommend to the Secretary of
the Navy that Moran Brothers, the New
port News Company and the Bath Iron
works be asked to accept contracts for
battleships at $3,600,000 each. The pro
posal of the Cramps was higher than
those, of the Bath Iron Works and the

HONOLULU, Dec. 19.â It is now
thought that the suicide of the famous
American scout, Frank Bennett, was due
to remorse on hearing of the: death by
poisoning of Miss Clara Schneider and
that her death was also by suicide, for
which Bennett held Mmsclf responsible.
A eearching investigation by the police
failed to bring forward any proof that
Bennett gave her the poison. How she
secured the drug remains a mystery and
will probably never be known.
Bennett had kept his relations with her
secret from his friends and though it is
thought that the two were together on
tbe night when the Girl took the poison
this has not been proved. When she be
came ill Bennett made manv â¢ inquiries
about her and after her death he was seen
but little. He retired to .his room and
ehot himself the next day.
TORPEDO BOAT STATION
FOR MARE ISLAND
Recommendation Made by Admiral
Crowninshield to the Navy
Department.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.-Because of
the deteriorated condition of the machin
ery of the torpedo boats, the formation of
a flotilla to accompany the North Atlantic
squadron on Its winter cruise was to-day
found to be an impossibility. The depart
ment haa directed that all torpedo craft be
given a thorough overhauling, and many
thousands of dollars will have to be ex
pended in putting them into condition for
eea service. -
Admiral Crowninshield suggests that a
station for torpedo boats be established
at Norfolk. Va.. where there Is no danger
of their being frozen in, and that each de
partment of the navy be called upon to
furnish memorandum as to the best meth
od of caring for the character of craft un
der Its particular control. He recommends
that a torpedo boat station for the Pacific
Slopo be established at Mare Island and
that a cub-inspector be stationed there.

BENNETT'S SUICIDE
DUE TO REMORSE
Special Dispatch to The Call
HARIUSBTJRG. Pa., Dec. 27,-Former
Senator M. S. Quay will not arrive until
to-morrow afternoon, but several of his
political friends are on the ground watcli
nig every movement having a bearing on
tho United Slates Senatorial vote.
As to the result there Is nothing but
conjecture. Attorney General Elklns
who is Quay's most prominent BUpporter
said to-night that there was no doubt
of the organization of the Senate and tho
House by the regulars and that Quay
would be elected United States Senator
on the first ballot. Quay's vote, he an
nounced, is 135 in both branches of the
Legislature. The number of votes re

The figures are said to be the result of
the most rigid Inquiry into the purposes
of members of the Legislature which
will meet here on New year's day If
the regulars should be able to organize
the Senate and the House, all doubts of
Quay s election would vanish, but promi
nent Insurgents and Democrats assert
that the House will be controlled bv them
and that the election of its officers will
be the forerunner of Quay's defeat.
The statement was . made to-day that
every Democratic member of the Legis
lature but one had signed a paper con
taining a sufficiency of names of Demo
crats and anti-Quay Republicans to make
sure of Quay's defeat for Senator. This
list also showed that the Insurgents and
lh^. Democrats would organize the House.
The fact that Colonel Quay has rented
a house for the winter is interpreted by
ni3 enemies as meaning that he antici
pates a protracted struggle. They declare
that his apparent confidence in victory
is assumed. His friends believe he stands
a good chance of winning.
Claim He Will Be Elected
Senator on the First
Ballot.

The members of St. Peter's parish ten
dered their pastor, Rev.' P. S. Casey, a
reception last evening in the parochial
hall as a welcome to tha reverend father,
who has just returned from a year's rest
and vacation In Europe. That the rest
was beneficial to him was apparent to
every one and In the course of Father
Casey's reply to the welcoming addrea*
he said that he felt ten years younger and
that he never was in better health in his
life.
The hall was tastefully decorated for
the occasion with everereens and holly.
Over, the stagre.in bold letters of silver,
was the Inscription, "Welcome Home."
An interesting programme was rendered
during the evening. It was as follows;
March. 'Rifle Regiment" (Souna). orchestra:
chorus. "Welcome." senior pupils of St. Peter's
Academy; cornet solo, "The Holy City. ' O.
ApÂ«l; choral. "South Winds Blow," 8t Peter's
Choral Society; specialties, J. C. ODonnell;
duet for flute and clarionet; "The Butterny."
C. Dlckman and B. Dowland; chorus "Home
Again," boy? of St. Peter's School; address P
J. Tormey; reply. Rev. P. S. Casey: tenor
Â»olo, selected, William .J. O'Brien; address,
Rev. P. C. Yorke; Informal reception.
P. J. Tormey delivered the address of
welcome. In reply Father Casey said in
part :
Words cannot express my happiness to be
again back in my dear parish. But I* feel that
during my absence the work has been perfectly
attended to by the Rev. Father P.|C. Yorke.
In Boston the father* were all anxious to have
him come and permanently reside In that city.
His reputation has spread from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. But I am sure that he will
never leave San Francisco until he I* railed
by the Holy Father to take charge of a diocese.
We have a beautiful church In this parish,
dedicated to St. Peter, but the parish house Is
In a very bad condition. In the past the peo
ple have responded nobly to appeals, and I do
now hope that they will do all in their power
to build a new abode for the parish priests,
which certainly we are very much In need of.
Rev. Father P. C. Yorke closed the re
ception with a few remarks.- He said in
part: i
When I assumed charge of this parish a year
agro I was very dubious ss to what the result
Â¦K-culd be. I was a perfect stranger to you all
and had never had any parochial experience be
fore, but thanks to you all the task became
very easy for me. I wish to thank Father
Lyons, Father Grant, Father McDonald and the
good Sisters of Mercy, who have done so much
to assist me. The Christian Brothers are also
to be praised for the good work that they have
done, They mold the minds of your children
and teach them how .to become stanch and
lcyal Cathollos. The parish Is sadly in need
ot a new abode for thÂ» clergy. The present
house fall* to keep out either the wind or the
rain. They may talk about there being; mi
crobes out In the City and County Honpltat
but I am sure that the parish house Is Just
a* full of them.
I wish to thank you for your hearty co-opera
tion with me. I have never spent a happier
year In my life than I have as the temporary
pastor of this parish.
At the close of Father Torke's address
the members 'of the parish, passed fay
Father Casey in rotation and all shook
hands with him and assured him of thÂ«*ir
pleasure at seeing him return safe and
in such good health.

Banquet.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 27.â To save* her
self from being hacked to pieces
by her mad son yesterday after
noon, Mrs. Qustave Cohen of 1533
Willow street, struggled for half
an hour before she finally released herself
from his deadly grasp. As a result of the
encounter the mother's body is covered
with black and blue marks. She owes her
life to the fact that she is robust and that
her son is in an emaciated physical con
dition, for they were alone in the house.
Yesterday was Mrs. Cohen's day for
housecleanlng. Her son Laseer, who has
been slightly demented for over a year,
was about the house assisting to do small
things under his mother's direction. There

The suicide of the former Vice Consul.
Paul Antoine.
Baron St. Laurent, although compara
tively a young man, is no novice in con
tular alfaire. Ills Government early placed
upon his ehoulders great responsibilities,
and these he has discharged with sucn
marked ability that he has been selected
to handle the affairs of state between the
two countries in this most important post
In the West.' His knowledge of the con
ditions affecting iho Pacific Coast wis
gained by many years* residence as a
irpreser.tative of the French republic in
York, Oalvoston, Philadelphia. Que
bec Â«nd Chicago. His last three years of
â¢ilTieial life wore spent in Vancouver,
That Baron dp St. Laurent is made of
good diplomatic stuff Is evidenced by his
actions in Madagascar, when the dusky
Wueen of that tropical African island de
clared war against France. The Baron
then^had about O.iW.OOO natives to deal
with, end only twenty-two Frenchmen to
aid him. These were at Motzanga. away
in the Interior. Armed natives were be
tween them and the coast, but the Baron,
aided only by a young lad, led them
through safely and won the praise ami
g|M decoration of his Government.
"It was the worst experience I ever
Â«ad." said the Baron yesterday, "but I
yiappily got through it ail right. It was
rothing." he said, with a shrug of the
"houldors.
"I a.m delighted to be in San Francisco,"
he continued, "if even for a short time.
The French colony is to united, so inde
fiendent and so full of good <leeds. Those
afiicsâ they are working hard to give the
vioor a little comfort"â referring to some
laflles of the society preparing presents â
"and they work day and night. Even in
my brief *Ftay so far. I find San Krancls
co's French colony one of the most closely
united and patriotic that I have seen."
As soon as the Baron and his wife have
'(Â¦Â¦covered from the fatisrue incident to
â¢hÂ»ir unexpected call and necessarily hur
ried departure from Vancouver, they will
be made the recipients of a number of
Â»ocial functions at the hands of the lead

SAYS A BLONDE
WOMAN SHOT HIM
Mysterious Tragedy in the
Office of an Indianapolis
Citizen. ;
INDIA NAPOLIS. Dec. 27.â William H.
Smyihe, secretary of the Masonic Grand
ix>dse of this State, was shot in the head
in his office in the Masonic building
Fhortly after noon to-day. Â¦ Mr. Smythe
eays a woman did the shooting, but the
police have so far been unable to locate
her. It is believed he cannot live.
... v. ,- a. Colernan. an attorney, found
Mr. JSrnythe shortly after he was shot.
Hi- went to Sir. Smythe's 'office' fn .the
Masaonlc building soon after -noon and
i<tu:Â»d him lying in a pool of blood on
the floor. Mr. Coif man says, he detected
ihe smeJl of gunpowder the moment he
stepped into tne room.
The wounded man was in a semi-con
tcious condition, but was able at intervals
to utter a few coherent words. The po
lice asked Mr. Smythe to tell who did the
shooting and he told them his son would
frire the information. He was able to
say, however, that he was seated at his
desk when a blonde woman entered his
office and a^ked to use the telephone,
'fehe had been there several times before,
Â«*nd this last call irritated him and he re
fused her request. He claimed that after
he refused hor the use of the telephone
the drew a revolver from the bosom of
her dre?$ and tired.
Shortly after the tragedy Dr. Elmer
Smyihe, tbe son referred to_ came in- He
intiMed that he knew nothing of the
woman or lhÂ«> shooting.
A surgeon was called immediately after
the phooting, and when he arrived he be
pan probing for the bullet. The wound
Â¦was directly behind the rlfe-ht ear and In
a short time parts of the bullet were
found and extracted.
Boon after the Fhootihg Mr. Bmythe
.- Â¦ -kr d for his son, Elmer, and requested
that all leave the room-* for a few lnln
â¢Â¦Â¦'ry. which was done. I^ater he said his
Fon would grive them the name of the
v.oman and all about her. The son per
5i*ied in his statement that he knew noth
ing of her. An attempt was made to lo
cate the woman at the Lorraine, but in-
QUlry developed the fact that there- -was
or had been no woman connected with the
hotel who could have done the shooting.
When the eearcl. failed to reveal any
trace of her the theory was advanced
that Mr. Smythe had attempted to take
tils own life. The persons who advanced
the theory eay it is strengthened by the
fact that within the last year Mr. 8mvthe
had threatened to take his life. HU son
*a!d that while his father had been very
rfierpondftnt at times during the past year
he was unwilling to lx>lieve that he had
attempted to kill himself.
At the home of Mr. Smythe it was im
jyÂ»PFible to find any clew to the woman
â¢who hÂ» paid "did the shooting.
Mr. Smythe Is widely known In In
diana. He ramp to this city twenty-five
vears apo from Greencastle to take the po
fition of secretary of the Masonic CÂ» r and
I oflge of Indiana, a position which he has
filed to the pre*>*>nt time. He Is one of
the best-known Masons in the State and
if hlphly esteemed. Early in the summer
Mr Smythe received a sunstroke, which
incapacitated him for work. In fact he
has never recovered.

â¢soap the son threw It at his mother with
all his strength. The frisrhtened look on
her face pleased him greatly, and h*
laughed uproariously. Frightened at the
spectacle Mrs. Cohen Btarted to run down
the hallway toward the kitchen door, but
cefore she reached the door the son over
took her. Â¦
In the struggle that followed mother
and son fell through the kitchen door
upon the rear porch. Several times there
was imminent danger of a fall down the
rear flight of steps, a height of eight feet
On this porch the Cohens have been ac
customed to keep their wood and coal and
a hatchet, and this hatchet tbe son se
cured and turned it against his mother.
In his weakened condition, however, dus
to his dementia, he was not able to carry
out his Intention, more than to strike her
once or twice across the breast. Fortun
ately. Mrs. Cohen's clothing was quite
heavy and the not-over sharp blade
failed to penetrate to the flesh.
By this time the son was pretty well
exhausted and when th#> Climax came ne
sank to the floor, hardly able to move.
The mother then got cut of harm's way
as soon as she could. ShÂ« said to-day that
she would have called for help but that
she preferred to suffer herself and be
spared the humiliation attendant upon the
arrest of her aon for insanity.
Mrs. Cohen was persuaded by her other
son* to- have Lasser placed in an asylum,
and thla morning she had him arrestel
and taken to the Receiving Hospital In
Oakland to undergo an examination for
. insanity.
"It was the first time he ever became
violent," said Mrs. Cohen. "He has twÂ»eti
Impudent a number of times, but there
never was anything to indicate that he
would become suddenly mad. I wai ter
ribly frightened when he reached the
hatchet, but I was determined that I
would not cry out. I felt that I was
strong enough to overcome him myself.
"I have had my son under a physician's
care for a long time. I had hopes that
he would recover. They wanted ms Â«Â»
have him sent to an asylum, but I am hi*
mother and I could not bear to think c."
anything of that kind."

TARIFF BILL FOR
THE PHILIPPINES
Taft Commission Completes
Measure and Reports to
Washington.
MANILA. D-c. 27.â The Philippine Com
mission has completed the tariff bill and
mailed It to Washington for approval. The
decision of the commission will be made
public Monday.
The first question dealt with by the
commission affecting an issue between the
church and the United States Government
is whether the control of the San Jose
medical college Is vested In the Govern
ment or In the church. The r college was
established by bequest in the seventeenth
century %nd the Jesuit order was given its
control. When the authority of the
Jesuits In the Philippines ceased the Span
ish Government assumed the direction of
the college, and later permitted the Do
minican order to conduct San JosÂ© Colleg*
as part of the University of Santo Tomas
Following the American occupation a rep
resentative of the people insisted that the
college under the treaty of Paris came
into the control of the United States and
ought not to be controlled by the church.
The church authorities claimed the
church had full legal possession General
Otis finally closed the institution. ThÂ« first
hearing took place shortly after the com
mission arrived. Archbishops Chapell*
and Nozaleda made the presentations of
the church.
If the commission decides that the con
trol is vested in the Government litigation
is considered probable.

Developments In the mystery of the dis
appearance of Captain Herman Stendel
of the sloop Lulu have reached a stage
where the authorities of Contra Costa
County are convinced that murder was
done; that Stendel was the victim of a
bay pirates' quarrel and was killed by a
companion, for whom Sheriff .Veale of
Martinez Is now searching In three coun
ties. 'x-* 1 ?^. -. Â¦ . '^-^7 . v - Â¦" Â¦. Â¦Â¦Â¦:
Since the strange of the Point
Plichmond mystery was uncovered all
sorts of theories havo been afloat to; ac
count : for the sudden dropping out of
sight of Stendel. Th-.- cries that werÂ«i
heard in the dark night, the appearance
in the morning of the deserted sloop, the
still unsolved circumstances combined to
force a surmise, at least; of, something
more than mere accident to account for
the affair. Indeed, as soon as It wait
brought to the attention of Sneriff Veal?
that official decided to â¢ make the most
thorough Investigation possible. .
Another boat and aaother man, dark
visaged and piratical in bearing, have ap
peared Upon the scene to complicate the
case and. to cast more clouds Â¦ upon the
situation. The Sheriff would be glad to
find that man and to locate a 1 sloop of
green hull, and size and rig almost iden
tical with the Lulu.
In his inquiries to-day at Point Rich
mond Sheriff Veale had a long interview
with Watchman Masuire, the railroad
employe at Point Richmond, who heard
the shrieks for assistance last Thursday
night. Magulre said:
"A couple of days. before that night I
saw a green boat of about the same aize
and rig. as the sloop Lulu anchored off
the Point." A couple of men came ashore
from the boat. One of those men waÂ« a
dark-featured fellow and did not seem
to be a companionable appearing
stranger. Shortly after that the green
boat disappeared and 11 did not see any
more of It. The circumstance did not
make any special impression upon me at
tho time, but now I am satisfied, in view
of the developments, that this dark man
was a partner of Stendel, who was un
doubtedly the other man that came
ashore." , â¢/.-â.-
Added to this is the further statement
of Sheriff Veale: "In trying to trace thi*
green boat I found that it was near the
sloop Lulu the moraine after the cries
were heard. The cacaln of the Ocean
Wave saw the green Moop lying near the
Lulu. He saw a man leave the strange
sloop in a small boat, pull over to the
Lulu and pick up a Whitehall boat that
was made fast to the stern of the Lulu.
The man towed the Lulu's boat back to
his sloop, made sail and left the Point."
Continuing Sheriff Veale said: "I be
lieve that when I find the green sloop and
her owner I will be close upon a solution
of this Point Richmond mystery. There
is no question In my mind that this miss
ing man. was murdered."
The finding on the Lulu of a great
quantity of railroad car fittings and cast
ings used in repair .work on cars and
tracks has caused an Investigation con-'
cernlng the stuff. In this connection Dep
uty Sheriff John Striker of this city has
the following to say: "From what I can
see I am satisfied that this is a case of
a quarrel between two bay pirates about
the division of plunder ' and that one
knocked the other overboard. For sever
al months much complaint has been made
of the theft from the railroad yards along
the bay shore, notably at Port Costa and
Sulsun, of large quantities of valuable
railroad Iron, journals, and other brass
castings.
"The idea prevailed that the thieves
carried' this stuff' away , in wagons and
hauled It to Oakland and to San Fran
cisco and this, city, disposing: of It at
good prices to junk Sealers. But I was
satisfied after a careful watch that the
stuff was not cominff overland. , I be
lieved that bay pirates \Vere responsible
for the wholesale stealing. The point*
from which the stuff was tnken are all
on the bay shore, accessible from a boat.
The Point Richmond disclosures convince
me that the thieves were on the Lulu and
had been long using hor and perhaps
other ploops of her handy rig for their
piratical excursions. One cannot plaus
ibly account In any other way for the
stuff found on the sloop. If it were being
freighted legitimate owners would have
long since claimed the property, and that
no one has appeared in that role pottles
me In my conviction that It was stolen,
every pound of it." ~
Sheriff Veale has searched the bay
shore and Oakland harbor for the green
sloop without success. He will continue
the hunt about the bay. ;

TO ARRIVE.
Quarantine Officer Klnyoun has lost the
friendship â¢ of the raf tmen, towboat men
and the members of the Dundon Bridge
Company by his actions on Christmas
eve. The tug Millie was towing a raft
of piles to the creosoting works,' but when
she got Into the tide rip she could Â¦ not
hold the mass of lumber and' the binding
chains breaking, the piles went adrift.
Many of them were picked up by fisher
men and returned to the Dundon . Bridge
Compapy, which paid $2 for each log re
turned. Six of the piles went ashore near
the quarantine station and when the crew
of the Millie went to get them, they were
driven away. After waiting until Dr.
Kinyoun got through dinner they askol
him for the logs. He said they would have
to pay $2 80 each for them. An offer, of
52 was made and refused. The tug : went
away and came back the next day. with
$15, which was turned over to the doctor
and the piles were released from quaran
tine.
Dr. Klnyoun's receipt reads as follows:
"Received of the Dundon Bridge and Con
struction Company, for Dan .Shay, So-
Kinyotm in Bad Odor.
Chief Engineer Little and First Assist
ant Church were formerly on the Alame
da. Purser Hodson was formerly on the
Moana and the rest of .the crew are stran
gers. Little), Hodson and ' Church require
no Introduction to the public traveling to
Australasia.
The officers who came In on the Sonoma
were C. F. Herriman, captain; C A. Hol
bert, chief officer; F. W. Jones, second
officer; G. A. Hill, third ' officer; A. D.
Little, chief engineer; S. Church, first as
sistant engineer; G. A. Hodson. purser;
G. Bradfleld, surgeon, and F. Rogers,
chief steward.
The Sonoma did not have very good
luck during the run. On the third day out
from Philadelphia a fireman named
Adolf Hedln dropped dead from heart dls .
ease. While off the River Platte a big
aea broke aboard and G. Krlstensan was
washed against the bulwarks and had hta
leg broken. When nearing the Straits- of
Magellan the pumps got out of order and
it took the entire force, of the engine
room to straighten them out again. Once
through the Straits all went well and a
quick run was made to San Francisco.
The Alameda will go out on her usual run
to Australia next Wednesday and the So
noma will follow her on January 23.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's So
noma arrived from the East last Wednes
day night in the record breaking time of
87. days 4 hours, actual steaming time.
Her only stops were in the Straits of Ma
gellan, when Captain Herriman was com
pelled to anchor over night. The Sierra
made the run in 29 days 16 hours, but then
she had to stop at Coronel for coal. The
Alameda, which held the record for years,
was over 40 days in coming here, so if -the
Ventura, the last of the new mall boats,
does not 'beat 37 days 4 hours the Sonoma
will hold the record for many a day to
come.
Time From. Philadelphia.

ANOTHER KECORD BROKEN.
ThÂ© bark Fresno, now out 29 days from
Port Gamble, is thought to be all right,
as Captain Peterson would undoubtedly
stand off shore as soon as the southeaster
or southwester (it seems to have been a
circular storm) came up.
AlvD still tales of disasters at sea
pile in. The recent storm must
have raged with great force, as
every vessel that comes Into port
reports a hard time of it. The
Bchooner Chas. E. Falk got In from Port
Hadlock yesterday and the captain has
this to say of the voyage:
"December 16, In a heavy southeast gale
"In latitude 45 degrees 40 minutes north,
longitude 126 degrees 16 minutes west, a
big sea broke over the vessel, completely
submerging her. Piled the whole port
eide of the deckload up In a heap. Broke
several chain lashings and lashing plates.
Took the mainsail and spanker, which
were double reefed, clean out of the ropÂ«s.
"At 9 a. m., same date, the wind
changed to southwest and blew with hur
ricane force. Barometer fell to 28.40.
"Continual heavy gales to December 22.
"December IS had to throw about 50,000
feet of lumber overboard In order to save
the masts and rigging, as thÂ© lumber
kept working out on the lanyards and
forced out the chain plates and carried
away part of the rail on both sides..: Â¦
"Christmas day we had fair weather,
but little of Christmas cheer. â¢ We're glad
to be home, and that Is something to be
thankful for." . â¢
And now people are beginningr to wonder
what has become of the schooner Wing
end Wing. Bhe Is now 44 days out from
Port Hadlock, the same port which the
Chas. E. Falk left 20 days ago. People
who know the schooner well say she will
come in damaged but still in the ring.
Bhe is a very poor sailer, and it Is not
eo long ago that she started from. Santa
Cruz for Coos Bay and finally brought up
at Santa Barbara. Forty-four days out
and in a small echooner at that, the
chances are that Captain Hansen and his
crew are having a hard time of 1L Cer
tainly they had no merry Christmas.
Besides the Wing and Wing, there Is
now overdue the schooner Parkersburg,
22 days out from Coquille River; the
North 'Bend, 21 days out from Willapa
Harbor; ship Isaac Reed, 'Â£> days from
Seattle; ship Berlin, 19 days from Ta
coma; schooner Berwick, 19 days from
Coquille River; ship Eclipse, 23 days from
Tacoma; schooner Mary Bidwell, 22 days
from Coquille River, ana the schooner
Jennie Stella. 24 days from Grays Harbor.
All these vessels will have hard luck sto

But alas for the piecrust oromises of
widows. On Sunday Mrs. Letts and Con
ductor Boyer went down to San Jose and
without fuss or feather took each other
for better or worse It was a charming
ceremony in spite of the fact that the
brides head was done up In two-inch
bandages instead of being adorned with
the customary wreath of orange blossoms.
On Christmas day the Boyers cut short
tlielr honeymoon and, returning to the
5tem realfties of life, took up their resi
dence at the home of the bride, 2S77 Mis
sion street. Wednesday night at about
11 o clock Woodcock came to the Boyer
nome and pounding upon the front door,
cried out his opinion of weddings in gen
eral, varying the monotony of the under
taking by declaring at intervals that "he
would have the hlood of. the Bovers. even
if it took him thirty years to accomplish
his purpose. It is because of this desire
for Boyer life fluid that the charge has
been sworn to.
Last evening the Boyers made readv to
receive Woodcock, whose home adjoins
theirs. Mortimer Letts, Mrs. Rover's
twenty-three-year-old son. took up his
station at the front door with a business
like Fix-shooter In readiness*. Within the
house Boyer held guard, while the pluckv
wife stood by him. The police have not
as .yet located Woodcock.
, Woodcock is an -Kngllshtnan and has
four children ln the old country.
At last tho Woodcock style of argument
prevailed and with the widow's promise
to be his the motorman left the house.
It was at this point .that Woodcock had
recourse to his own forceful and peculiar
way <}f winning widows. He pulled out
a slcdire hammer from his pistol pocket
ami. grabbing tho lady by the throat, he
asked her again and again to grant his
puit. each time emphasizing his love pro
testations with a blow of the hammer.
His generosity had no effect upon the
tettfl affections, and the lady curtly in
fcrrrsed her admirer that she would* not
marry him if he were the last man on
earth.
'Trr about to come into $18,000," went
on the- ardent swain, "and if you will
only marry me I will give you not only
my love, but all my money."
"I hear you are to be married," said
the motorman.
"That's right," said Mrs. Letts.
"Am I to be the fortunate man?" asked
Wo jdcock.
"You are not." said the widow.
f.sy he Kent the fair widow a set of dishes
f.s a tre&Uac prciteat. and when he came
ty-f rvrning he made it known at the
