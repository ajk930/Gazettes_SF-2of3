NEW YORK. Nov. 22â Several members
of Miss Olpa Xethersole's company at

George Leslie again. Some of Captain
George McClusky's men, too, would like
to make his acquaintance. Mr. Leslie was
a "super" in "Sapho" at Wallack'a
Theater until last Thursday night. That
evening he left the playhouse suddenly
:Â»nd a lot cf money, jewelry and other
valuables belonging to members of the
company went with him. The matter was
reported to the police at once and all last
r.lgrht and to-day Detective Mannion was
looking for Leslie, but up to a late hour !
to-nifcht no trace of him had been found, i
The detective did manage, though, to
loam a RTcat deal about Mr. Leslie's past
historyâ for one thing, that Leslie isn't his
real name: for another, that this is not
the firpt time that he and other people's
property have disappeared together and
that In consequence on several occasions,
for various periods, he has been housed
and boarded at the expense of the State.
In fact, one such period ended only three
months ago.
The detective also secured evidence that
Leslie belongs to a respectable family and
that his mother resides in this city on up
per West Side. Leslie, who is a tall, fine
looking fellow with a manner that in
spires confidence, applied for a position

Boers for their welcome. I thank all this
population assembled in great concourse
Replying to the addresses of welcome
of, the presidents of the Paris and Mar
seilles committee Mr. Kruger spoke In
Dutch and in a low voice, accompanying
his words with energetic movements of
his hat. which he held in his right hand.
He said:
Xrug"eT's Thrilling Speech.
. Mr. Kruger repeatedly ccKnowledged
the acclamations of the crowds that filled
the sidewalks and balconies cf the nouses,
black with sightseers waving hats and
handkerchiefs. At several points along
the route several bouquets were presented
to him and on the balcony of the Military
Club stood a group of officers in gala uni
forms, who Joined In the ovation. On ar
riving at the hotel Mr. Kruger's ears were
greeted with the strains of the Boer
hymn, played by a local band. whil3 the
standard -bearers drew up jn two ranks
at the entrance and waved the standards
as Mr. Kruger, bareheaded, passed be
tween them to his apartments.
Kvery one expressed astonishment at
the robust and healthy appearance of Mr.
Kruger. considering his' 'advanced age.
He walked firmly, leaning but lightly
upon his cane, when he crossed the land-
Ing stage to the landau In vrnich he drove
with Dr. Leyds and MM. Paullat and
Thourel. The landau was followed by five
carriages containing Boer officials an.3
these were followed by six others convey
ing the officers of the Geldarland and the
members of the Marseilles reception com
mittee, all forming a procession, headed
by various societies with handsome ban
ners and escorted by a large police force.
The incident was the main topic of con
versation this evening anl Indignation
was universally and vigorously expressed,
but the adult better classes did riot peek
to magnify its Importance. The Mayor,
Immediately on hearing of what had oc
curred, issued vigorous instructions for
the discovery and prosecution of the cul
prits.
Throughout the evening, however, large
bands of students and other youths
marched up and down in front of Mr.
Kruger's hotel and of the hotel which was
the scene of the unfortunate incident,
cheering In chorus for Mr. Kruger and
the Transvaal and denouncing England.
These demonstrators were more noisy
than dangerous and the police wisely left
them to relieve their feeling3 by shouting
instead of interfering with them, which
might have created disorder.-
Students Denounce England.
The unfortunate occurrence at the hotel
on the main boulevard alone marred the
character of the demonstration, which,
up . to that time, had been unanimously
and exclusively a tribute of sympathy
and admiration. "Vive Kruger," "VIv%
les Boers" and "Vive la Llberte" were
tho cries that formed a hurricane of
cheering and swept over the city. Un
fortunately the reprehensible foolishness
of half a dozen persons In throwing small
coins Into the crowd as Mr. Kruger
passed acted like magic in conjuring up
an anti-British outburst, which It needed
all the promptitude and energy of the
police to prevent becoming a serious
disturbance. The hotel remained for the
rest of the day In a state of siege, while
at one time a procession several thousand
strong marched In the direction of the
British Consulate, shouting* "Down with
the English" and raising other threaten
ing cries. The result was that a strong
body of police was compelled to disperse
the demonstrators, although It was not
found necessary to make more than a few
temporary arrests.
He announced to the world this morn-
Ing that the Boers would be a free people
or die and the faces of the men about
himâ Fischer, Wessels, Groebler and the
other Boer representativesâ bore the look
of fearless determination, reflecting the
spirit that Mr. Kruger declared animated
every man, woman and child of the
Transvaal. â¢
Fearless Determination.
MARSEILLES. Nov. 22.â To-day proved
a triumph for Paul Kruger such as even
the Boer delegates and his most ardent
admirers failed to anticipate. The en
thusiasm which marked every step of his
progress from the time he landed until
the hotel was reached was a revelation,
e'wen to the people of Marseilles them
selves. It fully equaled if it did not sur
pass the frantic demonstration of pa
triotism with which France opened her
arms to Major Marchand at Toulon on
his return from Fashoda.
An assembly of such masses, exceeding
even the most sanguine estimate, might
perhaps be partly explained by the cere
monious obsequies of the Bishop of Mar
seilles, Including an Imposing religious
procession from the cathedral, but noth
ing can minimize the spontaneous explo
sion of sentiment displayed toward Mr.
Kruger by the entire population of the
first port and one of the largest cities of
France.
Yet the grandeur of this demonstration
perhaps ranks in importance to the em
phatic manifestos of "Nor compromise"
which Mr. Kruger delivered in a low voice,
but one vibrating with emotion, accom
panied by energetic gestures of the right
hand, stirring the hearts of all within
hearing. The last sentences of his decla
ration were uttered with a vigor and- a
decision which bore out his reputation as
the incarnation of iron will and stub
born resistance. His mere delivery of
a declaration of such far-reaching im
portance testifies to the independence of
his character, aa it came as a surprise
even to his intimate political advisers,
who, up to the last, were in ignorance of
his determination.
"Welcome him." savs the appeal. "la
the name of that liberty which you all
have at heart. Give him a most positive
testimony of our most profound admira
tion for and ardent sympathy with the
race of heroes of which he Is a magnifi
cent incarnation. Parts should say to
Mr. Kruger that sh# is entirely with him
in bis sacred mission.
PARIS, Nov. 22. 1:40 p. m.â The commit
tee of Boer independence has posted a
placard In Paris calling upon Parisians to
give Mr. Kruger the warmest possible
.welcome.
For the Paris Reception.
"In the name of President Kruser I
have the honor to drink to the health of
the President of the French Republic."
Mr. Kruger will leave for Paris act 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.
Dr. Leyds then said:
"I am fatigued and am In mourning.
Moreover, I never attend banquets. Oth
erwise I should have liked to spend a few
minutes with you and to thank you. I
shall never forget the warm welcome I
have had in your beautiful city. Your re
ception of me has surpassed all I could
have expected even from the city which
gave France her admirable national
hymn, that 'Marseillaise' which is the
song of all the peoples whose Independ
ence is threatened and who are struggling
against Invaders. I would that your ac
clamation could have been heard by all
those Boers in arms who are encamped
In our mountains. They would thank you
from the bottom of their hearts. I thank
you In their behalf. Could r have been
with you I should have also expressed my
thanks to all France and would have,
raised my glass in honor of her worthy
President, M. Loubet."
Dr. Leyds represented him at the ban
quet given In his honor, where all the
Boer officials and members of the pro-
Boer committees were present, and read
tho following message from, him:
Eventually becoming fatigued, he asked
that the other addresses be presented lo
him In writing and then withdrew again
to his apartments, where he passed the
eevning quietly, receiving no one.
After luncheon and a little repose Mr.
Kruger descended to the hall of the hotel,
where he received the delegations. He
sat In a gilded chair Immediately In front
of the fireplace. Dr. Leyds and Messrs.
Fischer and standing near him.
Dr. Leyds briefly interpreted the ad
dresses of the various speakers, but it
was evident that Mr. Kruger was
fatigued and found It a great strain to
follow the gestures of orators speaking a
language unintellglble to him, but ho
listened attentively with his hand to His
ear as Dr. Leyds gave him the gist of
what had been said.
Mr. Kruger replied briefly, declaring
how deeply he had been touched by the
unexpected warmth of his reception In
Marseilles and by the sympathy i of the
French people.
Tho Prefect and Mayor then, called to
pay their respects, the latter. M. Flals
sieres. making an eloquent speech In
sympathy with the Boers.
Finally, to testify his gratitude, he took
In his hand a corner of the French tri
color that was flying from the balcony
between the Transvaal and Free StatÂ«>
flags and pressed It to his heart again and
again. The enthusiastic people cheered
ldm until he withdrew to his rooms,
which he found half-filled with bouquets
and garlands presented by his admirers.
Presses Tri-Color to His Heart-
Soon after. In response to a thunderous
ovation, he appeared on the balcony and
repeatedly bowed, but as some ten min
utes elapsed without; a sign of abatement
In the enthusiasm, he "spoke a few words
which were Interpreted In French by Dr.
Leyds and were followed by a renewal of
the enthusiasm.
"I assure you that if the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State must lose their
Independence it will be because all the
Boer people have been destroyed with
their women and children."
"The war waged on as In the two re
publics fcas reached the last limits of bar
barism. During my life I have had to
flgbt many times the savages of the
tribes of Africa, but the barbarians we
have to fight now are worse than the
others. They even urge the Kaffirs
against us. They burn the farms we
worked so hard to construct, and they
drive out our women and children, whose
brothers and husbands have been killed
or taken prisoner, leaving them unpro
tected and roofless and often without
bread to eat- But, whatever they may
do, we will never surrender. We will
fight to the end. Our great Imperishable
confidences reposes In our God. We know
our cause Is Just and If the Justice of men
Is wanting to us. He. the eternal, who Is
master of all peoples, and to whom be
longs the future, will never abandon us.
to greet me, for although I wear mourn
ing for -the misfortunes of my country
and although I have not come to seek fes
tivities, still I nevertheless accept with
all my heart these acclamations, for I
know they are dictated to you by the
emotions which are Inspired In you by
your trials and by your sympathy for
our cause, which is that of liberty, which
awakened you. I am truly proud and
happy at having chosen as my point of
landing a port In France, to set foot on
free soil and to be received by you a3 a
free man. But my first duty la to thank
your Government for all the tokens of in
terest that again only recently it wiw
pleased to give me. I believe England,
had she been better informed, would
never have consented to this war, and
since the expedition of Jameson. wh3
wished to seize the two republics without
the necessity of firing a rifle shot, I hava
never ceased to demand a tiibunal of ar
bitration, which up to now has always
been refused.
LONDON, Nov. 23.â The rumor of the
Czar's death appears to be unfounded.
Nothing to confirm it has been received at
the Russian embassies In Berlin and
Paris, and the embassy here has received
nothing' since the bulletin yesterday
(Thursday).
Better news has been received at Copen

prise the nation's vacant nubllo lands, but if,
as has been claimed, there la water enough

It seems to me, therefore, that the plan pro

of a sword of honor being presented to

NEW YORK. Nov. 22.âRepresent
ative George W. Steele of Indi
ana, a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee, is
quoted in a special from Wash
ington 33 saying of the work of the ap
proaching short session:
"I express my personal judgment only
when I say that it woul'd be a good thing
for Congress to take action toward mater
ially reducing the number and amount of
taxes being paid by the people under the
present revenue act. I do not think there
Is much doubt concerning the passage of
the ship subsidy bill during this session.
The intention Is to ret this measure be
fore the House as early as possible. It is
a bill that ought certainly to pass.
"Under present conditions. I am not In
clined to favor the establishment of an
army of 100.000, as Is being advocated in
certain sections. Under the present law
we have from 63,000 to 65,000 men. That Is
quite a large army. Now. when the con
ditions become such that an army of that
size is not needed, we could easily, reduce
the number. I am not in favor of a perm
anent army of 100.000 Just now, because I
want to ascertain before I vote on the
subject Just how many men we are likely
to need when the army in Porto Rico
has been reduced, when troops have been
withdrawn from Cuba, and when the war
in the Philippines resolves Itself into some
tangible form or is concluded and guerril
la warfare is stopped.
"I think that the bill providing for a
reapportlonment In nccordance with the
Increase of population will be passed.
Some States under this law will no doubt
suffer, while others will benefit. â¢ I do
not think that the subject of decreased
Southern representation as a separate
matter will be considered at this session.
There Is no time for the decision of that
problem during a short session."

HOW PLAYING
A WAITING GAME
Chairman Payne was at first disposed to
oppose any reduction in excess of $20,000.
000. but Secretary Gage convinced him
and other Republican members of the
committee that it would be safe to cut
off $10,000,000 more.
The total cut In the documentary tax
schedule will foot up about $20,000,000 and
the repeal of proprietary taxes and modi
fication of legacy taxes will foot up about
$5,500,000 more, leaving about $4,500,000 t&
be cut off to bring the total up to $30,000,
0C0.' It is probable that this will be accom
plished by repeal of the special taxes im
posed by the war. revenue acts on banks,
bankers, brokers, billiard tables, bowling
alleys, theaters, circuses and other places
of amusement.
Persistent efforts are still being made to
have beer and tobacco taxes reduced, but
thus far they have not met with success,
and it is- not probable that any change
will be made in either of these schedule?.
Efforts are also being made to have
further changes made in legacy taxes, in
view of the fact that legacies are taxed
under the laws of some of the States.
Special excise taxes on refiners of petro
leum and sugar will probably be retained.
The reductions are much heavier than the
leading members of the Ways and Means
Committee contemplated before Secretary
Gage appeared before them and made his
statement showing that the condition of
the Treasury v.as such as to warrant a
material reduction in revenues.

TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â All pro
prietary stamp taxes and many of the
documentary stamp taxes will be repealed

before adjournment of the committee this
afternoon and the sub-committee consist

to a meeting of all Republican members
of the committee- and a meeting of the
entire committee, including the Demo
cratic members, will be called for Satur
day. December .1, Â¦when the text of the
bill will be made public.
Unusual efforts are being made to keep
the details of the proposed bill secret, but
it has been learned that it is not the
present intention to make any reductions
in taxes on spirits, fermented liquors or
tobacco. The entire reduction will amount
to about $30,000,000. Taxes that it has been
fully determined to repeal are those in
schedule B of the war revenue act. em

about $5,000,000; taxes oft telegrams and

So Great Is the Crush at Opening of
* the Box Office That Scalpers
Reap a Harvest.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Theater-ticket
speculators yesterday on the sidewalk in
front of the Garden Theater held seats
for Mme. Bernhardt'i opening perform
ance in "L'Alglon" next Monday night at
$25 each. The box-office price is tf. The
public, unable to buy Beats at the thea
ter, rebelled at the exorbitant charge.
The advance sale of seats for the en
gagement has proved larger than any
other since Pattl, In her prime, visited
New York. On Wednesday night the to
tal receipts, including checks for season
tickets, amounted to $80,000, and yester
day's sale swelled the total to more than
$100,000.
Richard Mansfield objected to having
the Bcrnhardt sale conducted in the same
box office with the sale of seats for his
laet performances of "Henry V," so , a
special box office was constructed for him
in the lobby of &e theater. The actor's
reason was that the crush in front of the
window was too great for the comfort of
his patrons.

Congress.
CHICAGO. Nov. 22.â The National Irr,*
patlon Congress, which began its ninth
annual session here last night, got down
to business to-day. President Elwood
Mead of. Wyoming presided. Sciplo Craig
of California made a motion that the
motto of the congress be "Save the For
ests, Btore the Floods," and that a com
mittee on resolutions flt instructed to
draft a memorial getting forth the ob
jects of the congress and showing the im
portance of the reclamation of the arid
lands in the United States and to report
Saturday.
On motion of ex-Governor J. Bradford
Prince of New Mexico committees on
credentials, organization, rules and reso
lutions were appointed, consisting of men
from each State and Territory represent
ed. Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the
United States Engineer Corps wars then
introduced and spoke on relations of the
general Government to reservoir construc
tion.
At the conclusion of Captain ChittÂ«m â¢
den's address a seneral discussion fol
lowed on the storage of water by the Gov
ernment for Irrigation purposes.'
At the night session a letter from Vice
President-elect Roosevelt was read, in
which ho said:
. I believe to th? last point In the vital necÂ°s
*lty of storing the floods ami preserving the
forests, especially throughout the plains of the
Rocky Mountain region. The problem of the
development of th* Greater West Is In part a
problem of Irrigation. I naturally believe In
Government clvlnsr generous aid to the mov-.
ment, for It Is not po?eible. and If It were poo-.
Bible It would not be wise to have this storage
work done merely through private ownership,
and owlnsr to the peculiar necessities _of the
case much of the work must be donlTy the
national and not by any State government.
A letter was also read from General
Nelson A. Miles. In which he said:

FULL telegraphic communication
with the outside world, disturbed
by the recent storm,' has once
more been restored. The big storm
which raised such havoc with the
telegraph and telephone wires all over, the
State appears to have exhausted, tempor
arily at least, its supply of ammunition,
and while meditating whether to burst
forth afresh or shift its course, humanity
is endeavoring to calculate to what extent
the benefits from the much-prayed-for
rain will be offset by the damage that has
'been wrought.
It is safe to say that not in many years
has Southern California experienced a
fiercer demonstration from the elements,
and those who have felt the storm's fury
most â whose property. has been wrecked â
marvel that there are no fatalities to
record or catastrophles to describe.
According to reports received by the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe companies
yesterday afternoon, the storm showed no
mercy for the lines of either of these big
roads. Seemingly solid earthworks, upon
which tracks were laid, were undermined
as if they had been loose piles of soft
sand; rails were torn up and carried along
with the rushing torrents ,11k* toothpicks
floating in a basin of water; telegraph
poles were rooted out of the earth or
snapped in two, while wires were twisted
and tangled Into a thousand knots. Great
gulches were mowed out of the ground
thirty feet deep and several hundred feet
long; massive stone abutments were car
ried off like so much chaff and even the
stout spans of iron bridges failed to with
stand the wind and water. .
Thousands of dollars' worth of damage
has been done to railroad property in this
State alone. Officials of the two roads
say it is many years since so much Injury
was caused by a single storm. It will
take many days to repair the damage in
some sections. Every available workman
has been put to work and the companies
are doing everything in their power to
prevent total demoralization of their
roads.
Another Storm Coming-.
A second storm Is reported to be on Its
way. There has been a decided change in
the temperature in Northern California
and according to Weather Prophet Mc-
Adie this section may get some snow for
a change. The second deluge which may
strike the coast has been sighted off Van
couver Island. Its path Is a little uncer
tain, but Mr. McAdie says there is a fair
chance that at least a section of it will
strike San Francisco. Â¦ -
Shortly after the noon hour yesterday
the Southern Pacific Company's telegraph
operators were able to communicate with
the outside world In a satisfactory man
ner. Before that time the lines for more
than twenty-four hours were either en
tirely or partially out of order. A raft of
telegrams began to pour into Manager
Fillmore and G. F. Richardson master of
transportation, late in the afternoon, and
the heads of these departments were kept
busy until a late hour sending out instruc
tions.
There were seventeen different wash
outs between here and Los Angeles
These were hurriedly repaired, and at 4 "30
yesterday afternoon the first train for the
day was sent out.
The limited through train which is due
here at 10:16 a. m. was. according to last
reports received yesterday afternoon,
stalled at Pomona, east of Los Angeles
Between Pomona and Bassett terrible
havoc was raised with the road. Rails
and ties were broken and standing ver
tically for a distance of many hundred
feet.
The "flll" at San Demas Is washed out
to a depth of thirty feet. A stretch of
half a mile of track has been washed out
on the Santa^Ana branch track and some
of the rails were carried ten feet.
Tore TJp Rails and Ties.
A stretch of 1480 feet of track was wash
ed off the bed a mile west of Puente; also
300 feet at Yerbas crossing, and ten minor
washouts between Puente and Oil Siding.
There were also washouts at Burbank,
Ravena and Merced.
Some damage is reported on the new
Coast division. Word reached the local
offices yesterday that the inspection party
composed of Vice President H. B. Hunt
ington. Chief Engineer Hood and General
Manager Kruttschnltt had left Salinas to
continue its inspection. The party was
stalled at Pajaro, where a tunnel col
lapsed and blocked the track.
The Santa Fe did not suuer quite as
much as the Southern Pacific, though
grave fears are entertained lest tho storm
continues to work east, where it would be
likely to injure the Santa Fe most.
General Manager W. G. Xevin, whose
headquarters is in Los Angeles, arrived
in the city yesterday on a special train.
He reports numerous small washouts
along the route.
"We have spent a great deal of money
of late." said Mr. Kevin last evening, "in
fortifying ourselves against storms of this
kind, and but for this fact I think the
damage to the Santa Fe lines would have
been much greater.
"But it is bad enough as It Is. It would
take a terrific storm to hurt us at all" so
you can judge for yourself the severity of
this storm. It seemed to me more like a
cloudburst. We hope to have all our
trains running on time again by Friday.
Train No. 5 from Bakersfleld, due here at
8 a. m. did not get in until 4:30 this after
noon."
At Le Grande the Marlposa Creek flood
ed the tracks to such a depth that it was
impossible for a train to get through. On
the Santa Ana road workmen had Just
finished the construction of a new bridge;
yet, despite its newness, the storm swept
away one pier and two spans an- iÂ».u
other damage that will take some time to
repair.

DENVER, Colo.. Nov. 22.â It is impos
sible for the railroads to estimate tho
amount of damage suffered by reason of
the windstorm which swept the lines for
nearly one hundred miles along the base
of the mountains yesterday and lasc
night. The wires were blown down and
trains are moved with great caution in
the absence of telegraphic orders, seri
ously delaying traffic. Many freight cars
had their roofs blown off, station build
ings were damaged more or leas all
through the storm region and the tracks
etrewii with wreckage, which further re
tarded the movement of trams. Between
Pueblo and Colorado Springs houses were
damaged, haystacks blown away and out
buildings demolished. The property loss
will be heavy among the ranchmen.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Nov. 22.â
The city is rapidly taking on its normal
appearance after yesterday's storm. Ihe
damage will approximate $200,000 and is
due entirely to destruction by the wind,
all reports of serious lire losses being un
founded. There were ten alarms of fire
in ten hours, but no serious fires occurred.
Incandescent lights are burning to-night,
but the streets are still dark. Light wires
and telegraph wires are still strewn across
the trolley wires in many places an-1
street railway traffic will not be resumed
until some time to-morrow. About 600
houses and business blocks are damaged
and 150 trees are uprooted.
No lives were lost in the storm, and Col
onel E. T. Ensign, who was struck by a
telegraph pole and suffered a broken leg,
has the most serious injury. The storm
was not attended by rain or snow. The
gale came direct from Pikes Peak, which
is west of the city, and it blew from 1 p.
m. to 2 a. m. At 2:30 p. m., when the wind
gauge at Colorado College was destroyed,
it had registered a velocity of 82 miles
per hour. The weather to-day has been
fair and warm, with little wind.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 22.â The
path of the storm in Arkansas is strewn
with wrecked farm houses. The â¢ fatali
ties in Lee County will not exceed six and
are confined mainly to negroes.
BUFFALO, Nov. 22.â Inspection of the
Government breakwater shows that a sec
tion about 1100 feet In length was demol
ished by the. storm of last night. This
section was being repaired and the waves
which pounded upon it dashed away so
much of the structure that extensive re
pairs will be necessary. The damage Is
estimated at 5200,000.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22.â The storm
that reached its culmination last
night was the most severe that
has been experienced in Los An
geles since tho great deluge of
1SS9.
The local Weather Bureau this morn-
Ing reported the precipitation for the
twenty-four hour3 preceding 5 a. m. to
day as 3.G6 inches, a downpour such as
has rarely been equaled in this part of
California. The total for the storm was
6.53 Inches. The Blight precipitation that
preceded the storm swelled the total for
the season to 6.79 inches.
Between 5 p. m. last night and 5 a, m.
to-day more than two Inches of rain fell
in this city. The consequence was such
a flooded condition of the streets as prac
ticaily prevented local traffic. Many of
the residents were compelled to secure
shelter down town, where the deluge had
caught them. The hotels were packed with
storm-bound guests, some, of whom live
not a mile from the center of the city.
The street-car systems were tied up on
all divisions. The passengers on tho
"Westlake line were drawn through a
flood at the corner of First street and
Fremont avenue, where the water pourod
in a torrent the full width of the street
and a foot deep.
The principal divisions of tho railway
Bystems centering at Los Angeles were
completely tied up by the storm. Wash
outs were known to exist, but no detailed
statements could be obtained to-day as
the wires were down in all directions.
Construction trains were sent out on tho
various divisions. Not a wheel was turn
ing on the Santa Fe lines, and the San
Pedro and Santa Monica divisions of the
Southern Pacific were the only ones open
to traffic this 'morning. Several washouts
on the Redondo Railway Comnany's nar
row-gauge line held the road Inactive un
til noon. The Terminal Railway beach
line was running trains this afternoon,
but the Pasadena and Glendale branches
were only open to traffic to-night Wash
outs rendering it unsafe to send out
trains were reported on both divisions.
Kast of Barstow on the Santa Fe no
trouble was experienced, but serious dif
ficulty was apprehended In the Cajon
Pass and on the Surf lino.
Los Angeles County has had a minia
ture Galveston disaster of its own. At
beautiful Terminal Island, heretofore one
of the ideal summer and winter resorts of
Southern California, more than two
blocks present a picture of desolation,
property being damaged to the extent of
$5000.
The high seas with a heavy southwest
wind dashed angrily against the bulwarks
that protected . the pretty cottages and
homes. By 7 o'clock this morning the
breakers were seven feet high and the
spray was above the second story win
dows. When the sea began rolling higher
and higher, the protecting jetties in front
of Terminal Tavern and of the cottages
were washed away and it was evident
that there was no hope of saving two of
the cottages from the fury of the great
waves. The islanders rallied to the as
sistance of the inmates of one of the cot
tages end made quick work of moving out
the furniture. The occupants of the sec
ond cottage had taken but a part of the
furniture from the house when the waves
swooped under the two doomed cottages
In the boiling, surging surf were heavy
logs and timbers that had been washed
from the Jetties. The timbers and the
angry sea together beating against the
slender supports soon knocked them out
and the front ends of the cottages went
crashing down. Tho buildings creaked
and trembled, â¢while the water rushed into
the rooms, destroying everything in its
way.
From Monrovia comes the story of the
worst storm in the history of the settle
ment. Colonel Baker's beautiful orchard
is badly damaged and the home of W. F.
Marshall is a sorry looking place. It is
entirely covered with rocks and debris
and the lawns and flowers completely
covered up. The grounds are as bare of
vegetation as the middle of the street.
Miss Anna Pettit and her niece had a
miraculous escape from death by drown
ing this morning while attempting to
cross the middle stream of the San Ga
briel River. The back seat of their car
riage camo out and dropped them into the
stream and they were carried down by
the swiftly running current sixty feet be
fore being rescued. Frank Thrasher at
the risk of his life, rushed into the
stream, 'the rocks knocking him about
like a piece of wood, but ho reached the
women almost exhausted and gallantly
carried them to the bank.
POMONA, Nov. 22.â Six inches of rain
fell during seven hours in this region last
night, and the severest injury ever known
has been done by the flood to all kinds of
real estate. All day yesterday rain fell
but as evening came on the downpour be-
The storm ceased at about 2 a. m At
dawn everybody in this region was up to
see how great damage had been done to
property. In some localities the Injury to
what has cost years of toll and a lot of
capital to create is pitiful. The severest
destruction In Los Angeles County has
been along the foothills in San Gabriel
Azusa and Pomona valleys. '

RAILBOAD MEN ACCEPT
COMPANY'S PROPOSAL
Conference Between Fillmore and
Trainmen Ends Satisfactorily
to Both Sides.
The conference between Manager Flll
more and the railroad men was practical
ly ended yesterday, although there will be
a final gathering of the delegates and
grand officers this morning. The company
presented a final proposition to the men
yesterday and after an executive session
which lasted three hours It was agreed
to accept the terms of the new schedule.
The schedule will go into effect De
cember 1.
- Grand Master Clark said last evening
that everything had been amicably set
tled and he was well satisfied with what
had been accomplished. "It has been a
case of give and take," he said, "and as
a whole 1 think the new schedule will
prove satisfactory."
In regard to the yardmen, many of the
switchmen who protested because < they
were not given representation ,at the con
ferences have since agreed to abide by
any schedule that might be drawn up by
the two railroad " associations, so what
ever objection Is now offered will come
from only a few disgruntled ones. An
effort will be made to conciliate them and
the ; . friction will probably soon wear
away. ' â¢"'."iV -,"-,'Â¦

Examination of Talesmen in Ho2
Murder Trial Goes Slowly
Forward.
The examination of Jurors for the sec
ond trial of Albert Frederick George Ver
eneseneckockockhoff, called Iloff for
short, charged with the murder of Mrs.
Mary A. Clute, proves to be a tedious
task. At tho present rate of securing
jurors It will take over a week before the
twelve shall have been accepted.
Twenty were examined yesterday and
only one was accepted. He was H. E.
Brodek, a bookkeeper. Those examined
were: J. J. Hughes. E. Unger, C. C. Riv
ers, Harry Sayler, A. J. Donzell, D. Rich,
A. Nordman, Daniel Bon, C. R. Havens,
Peter Koppen, George B. Barber, M. Hart,
A. W. Craig, I* Well, H. E. Brodek, E.
B. Rail, L. A. Rea. R. N. Nason, B. Low
enstein and S. I^ubin. The last named was
peremptorily challenged by the. prosecu
tion and the others were excused for
cause. Most of them had formed a den
nite opinion as to the guilt of the defend*
ant and others did not believe in con
victing a man charged with a capital of
fense on circumstantial evidence alone.
Seventy-six talesmen have now been ex
amined, and out of the number only three
have been accepted. Five have been per
emptorily challenged, two by the prosecu
tion and three by the defense. As the
venire, was exhausted the Judge ordered
another venire of 100 to be issued, return
able this morning, and court was ad
journed. v
Hoff's Interest ln the examination of the
talesmen was more Intensified yesterday.
He watched every question and answer
closely, and several times prompted his
attorneys to ask certain questions. A
nervous clasping and unclasping" of his
hands was the only Blgn that he was at
all excited.

THINGS broke very nicely for I
Trainer Walter Jennings at Tan
foran Park yesterday. His An
drisa burned the- track up In the
opening event. Vesuvian annexed
th*Â» handicap and later Asian, from the
fame stable, purloined a purse that right
fully belonged to Mortgage. All three
horses were ridden by Mounce, who. di
vided the saddle honors with "Monk"
Coburn.
A howl was raised among the horsemen
because of the track not having been har
rowed up. Instead It was Jry and sogjry
in spots", unxife and unsatisfactory to
race over. The fields were not heavy and
favorites captured four of the six events.
The performance of Autumn, favorite
for the introductory overture, grated
harshly on the nerves of those who had
put their checks down on the Hildreth
entry. For six furlongs the brown horse
refused to try. Then he made a bluff at
it. finishing third. Andrisa galloped in,
over half a dozen lengths before Specific.
There was a demand for only one of the
seven starters In the six furlong aprint
following. Mocorito attracted all the
play and the result never looked in doubt.
Our Lizzie acted her part well and
some othin piece will score a hit. When
thoroughly acclimated this mare will take
some beating. Away poorly Mldlove lost
the show to Sweet CaporaJ.
Boiled down to a Held of four nothing
looked to have a chance to beat Vesuvian
out of the handicap at six and a half fur
longs. A 1 to C favorite, Mounce waited In
behind the three other starters with him
until It looked as If he had been stricken
with stage fright. Then called to a drive
he managed to down Duckcy a neck on
the last couple of strides. 'Doc" Street's
Doublet came In for considerable support,
especially for the place, but proved a dis
appointment.
When it came to stretching the distance
out Andrattus was no match for Dkleror.
Each picked up 107 pounds in the handi
cap for two-year-olds over p:x and a half
furlongs and Diderot ruled a warm fa
vorite. Andrattus staid with tha first
choice to the stretch, but gradually weak
ened, finally losing the place to Setde, a
somewhat tardy arrival.
Scratched from the handicap the Burns
& Waterhouse stable started Mortgage In
the fifth recital and with only 97 pounds
In the saddle the mare closed equal choice
Â¦with Formero. Ransch had the mount 0:1
the favorite, and moving along from
fourth position, led Into the stretch.
Mounce astride Asian, who had been
forced to relinquish the front position,

Ransch winking won by a neck. Formero.
the early favorite, lost show honors to
Her ulean.
-A scrubby bunch of maidens started In
the concluding scramble. Billy Lvons,
the 2 to 1 favorite, -ridden by Coburn,
came home a clever vinner over Illusion
and George Dewey.
Track Notes.
Marty * Bergen, the popular old-time
rider, is here again. Marty did some ex

Commissioner Manson of tha Board of
Public Works had an uncomfortable half
hour before the Supervisors' Street Com
mittee yesterday morning as a result of
the neglect of the Board of Public Works
to make a recommendation for the per
formance of street work on Pine, Clay,
Sacramento and Washington streets, be
tween Sansomo and Montgomery.- The
board had originally recommended an in
ferior pavement of bitumen on a cobble
stone base, but this was overruled by
the Street Committee, which recommended
a modern pavement of asphalt on a con
crete base.
It Is declared that the Board of Works
Is nettled because Its recommendation waa
not accepted, and several members of the
North Central Improvement Association
expressed a fear that tho recommendation
for the superior pavement would not be
forthcoming on that account. As the
charter specifically provides that the
bpard must recommend the performance
of any street Improvements, It was
thought that tho proposed improvement
would be tied up Indefinitely.
Secretary Painter of the association
named stated that he had visited tho
Board of Works and found everything on
the subject in a state of confusion. He
was lntormed that no action would be
taken because the board had not been

OBTAINS DRAWINGS ON'
FALSE REPRESENTATIONS
Mrs. Lillian Kendall-Jones Swears to
a Warrant for H. O. Abbott's
Arrest.
Mrs. Lillian Kendall-Jones, the artist,
secured a warrant from Judge Mogan yes
terday for the arrest of II. O. Abbott on
the charge of misdemeanor. She alleys
that Abbott called at her rooms at 1812
Market street, representing that he was
the agent for the Gray Lithographing
Company, New York, and he would like
to have some of her drawings of Califor
nia popples to use on Christmas cards.
He got drawings valued at $20 last Janu
ary, and since then has refused to return
them, and on the company in New York
being applied to they wrote that they did
not know AbbGtt.
F. A. Aldrlch was held to answer before
the Superior Court by Judge Mogan yes
terday on two charges of burglary in $3000
bonds on each charge.' He stole a num
ber of carpenters' tools from new build
ings at California and Montgomery streets
and at 24 Turk street.
M. Lenack. the man who threatened to
kill Policemen Herring and Dougherty In
Chinatown Wednesday and when arrested
and searched had a slungshot, dirk knife
and revolver In his pockets, appeared be
fore Judge Fritz yesterday. He told the
Judge that he worked for a tailor and
some of the boys in the shop had put the
slungshot In his pocket; the knife he had
used for skinning sheep, and he was go
ing to sell the revolver. The Judge or
'dered him sent before the Insanity Com
missioners.
MERRITT REFUSED A
WARRANT FOR PERJURY
He Will Lay the Whole Matter Before
the Grand Jury for Investi
gation.
Warrant Clerk Peery again refused yes
terday to i&sue a warrant on complaint of
Charles W. Merrltt, 1312 York street, for
the arrest of Contractor George W. Mc-
Ginn on a charge of perjury, as detailed
in yesterday's Call.' Peery gave his re
fusal after hearing both sides of tha dis
pute, and as a reason for his refusal said:
"I refused the warrant because 1 deem
it as much my duty to protect Innocent
people from arrest as it Is to cause the
guilty to be arrested. The facts as they
appear to me are thai Mr. Merrltt Is not
at all damaged, Fllnn & Treacy.the con
tractors refusing to make any claim
against him for the work, and that Mc-
Ginn is entirely free from any criminal
motive whatever in what he did in the
premises. Under these circumstances I
cannot- but think that Merrltt desires the
warrant for other than a desire, to pro
mote public Justice."
Merritt will at once lay the whole mat
ter before the Grand Jury.

SEATTLE. Not. Â£.â Amcng the prison
ers fcroug-ht from Nome yesterday was
Gladys Shores, sentenced to five years
ia the McNeils Island penitentiary for
drug-^lrg and robbing William Conway, a
miner, during the summer carnival cf
: crime at Nome. Gladys Shores ia the
first woman prisoner at McNeils and there
ia another aide to the story that 13 con
siderably out of the ordinary.
Steadtastly maintaining her innocence,
she jives a statement to the presas, which
ia, to say th* least, startling in its naxure.
whether or not there be any truth tn it.
In a signed letter she sayi tn part: "My
arrest was brought about by the machina
tions of a United States deputy marshal
by the name of Campbell. Several days
previous to my arrest, while my husband
was away from town on. a. trip- to tne
hiils, this man Campbell came to me and
made a proposition that only a man cf his
caliber is capable of. On my indignant
refusal to comply with his request, or as
it misbt bÂ« termed command, he thrÂ«Â»a.c
ened to- have me put In jail. The sequel
shows how well be kept hi* word."
The letter states that whil* ilrs. Shores
was in her tent one evening a young man
named Myers brought Conway to th<Â»
door, and. statin? that he was ill. asked
that he be permitted to lie down. Camp
bell, who, the letter sayi, waa always
han^in? around the tent, saw the two
men enter and shortly afterward rc3hed
in, accompanied by two soldiers, and ar
rested Myers and Mrs. Snores on a cha-?e
of drug-jzlnz- and robbing Conway. MyerÂ«
escaped before the trial, but Mrs. Shore3
aa she says, by the perjury cf Campbell'
was convicted as an accomplice to the
robbery and se-ntenced to five year*
"Not longr after my trial," writes Mrs
Shores, "tne man Campbell wa3 trans
ferred to the jail as a zlzhz guard. Every
eight while he was on duty at the jail h*>
would come to my cell and make the <aae
proposition to me that he had madÂ«Â» be'o-^
my arrest. He also stated that if I had
?iven In to him before my arrest I would
not have been, in the preificanent I th a n
was and it was not too late yet to jrÂ«t out
of g-cins to the penitentiary.
"At last I sent for my attorney. M"-
Miller, and stated the facts to him. H*
said that the man should be prosecuted"
In the meantime one of Campbell's fello-w
oScers heard cf the consultation I had I
had with my attorney, and ccmin? to me
made the threat that tr I did not let
thinsrs go Campbell would p-eÂ«c-Â» a
charge of blackmail against me "*Sq

Prison Guard Samuel Randolph
Tvas shot down by a discharged
convict. J. EmxningtOTL, alias John
Conway, alias Larry Doyle, at the
doorway of Shepherd's Hotel at Point San
Quentin at about 3:3) o'clock this after
noon. Randolph will recover.
Following a usual custom, after 5
o'clock, a number of the guards, among
them Randolph, sauntered from the
prison down to the hotel for their mail.
In the barroom Emmington was seen, but
r.othing was thought of it. as he was o4T
the prison grounds and was accompanied
by a young man who had called at the
prison" to- see a convict. The trouble
started before any one realized it. Eia
mingtcn called Randolph a vile name and
said he never was any good. The ex
convict then backed to the door, and
drawing a revolver, took deliberate aim
at Randolph and flreci- His victim fell.
As the trigger was polled Randolph was

These who wer* present say that Em

than a man. After surveying the pras
trate man he ran down the read, taking
off his overcoat as he ran. At the first
break in the fence he left the road and
The alarm was given at the prison and
a large body cf guards was sent cut.
Sheriff Taylor hurried to the Point and
arrested the fugitive's companion and
locked him up in the County Jail. He,
however, claims to have known. Ernming

came here on the 1:20 narrow-gauge

Emmington has served several terms in

Ht had an ugly disposition and was al

Randolph has been a guard for seven
years and has had charze of the yard. It

The manzarita berries were a failure
and the acorns dropped from the oak trees

Mrs. Watkirs write? that ten years of
service with the Indians has accustomed
her eyes to sad sights, but she has never
seen anything like the picture which ia
presented by their prospective suCering
during- the coming months.
There will be many dead from, lack af
nourishment before the winter is passed
unless the white people of the State con
tribute to their support. On reserva
tions near the inhabited valleys the young
bucks secure work with the white ranch
ers and divide what they earn willingly
with those who are older and unable to
work, but neither old nor young know any
theory of life save money earned 13
earned to spend, anc it goes quickly.
There are many reservations, however
which are not within reach of work for
either young or old and it is on tho** that
there Is thÂ© zreatest suffering and li"-tely
to be the greatest lack of food.
Mrs. Mary Watkins, the teacher at MeÂ«a
Grande Reservation, where there are 3C6
people, of irhora twenty-seven, are so otd
that they are helpless, writes of having
visited seven of the reservations and
found the Indians in a dreadful condition
of want In all of them. Children and
women are almost naked, and there Is
not enough food tn any of the lodges to
keep the inhabitants thereof alive through
the winter.
The dry years have left the Indiana In
dire distress from lack of food and thetr
condition li Indeed pitiable. The Indian
ts never a provident bein^, and the years
which have not broug-ht enough, water to
the lands to admit of reaping aa zsuch aa
had been sown have left them poorer and
poorer and less able to stand against
privation.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 22.â The report that
there are In Han. Diego County several
hundred people In danger of starving dur
ing the ccmins 1 winter haj startled the
peopie of this city, but the facts are

caw taJce a back seat, Tor a new fad has
the fioor.
A society has recently been formed, the
members of which pledge themselves to
eat no food whatever that has b*?en cook-
ed. Tney claim, that uncooked food 13 the
only rational heaithfril diet; that our re-
mote ancestor* ate no codked food and
therefore if we do the sarnÂ© vigor and
health will be our reward.
Raw meat, raw potatoes, raw wheat,
raw e*g*. raw everything. Is the enticing
bill cf fare held out to the enthusiastic
food craaic of th<s future, and ths society
proposes to establish restaurants In the
larger cities where thi3 delightful menu
may be served daily.
Modern cooking ia often a dyspepsia
producer, because we fry so many foods
which should bÂ» baked, roasted, broiled
or boiled; fried food is indigestible be-
cause each particle of food i3 incased in
hot jrrease. which th* digestive juices of
ths ston^ich cannot easily penetrate; but
properly cooked food 13 more easily di-
gested than the same feed uncooked, asd
we predict for the new fad a very limited
following-.
The real cause of indig-*stion Is the lack
of Hydrochloric acid ati<2 peptones in the
stomach, so that no matter how well
cooked the food it cannot be well digested
unless the gastric Juice i3 abundant and
contains the necessary amount of pep-
tonos to dissolva the food.
Therefore the most sensible cure for
poor digestion is to take after* each, meal
some safe and reliable digestive like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which supply
peptones to dijrest the meat and eeg-s and
diastase to digest thÂ« bread, potatoes and
similar starchy foods.
Laxative medicines never cure Indiges-
tion, because they have no digestive effect
whatever upon the food; on the other
hand. If the food Is properly dig-esti^d
there will be no need of laxatives. Good
digestion does away wirh constipation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tabl-ts contain pure
aseptic pepsin (government test) diastase
and the dig-estive elements which weak
stomachs lack, and they cure indigestion
by assisting the overworked, rundown sto-
mach in its hard work until it is restored i
to its normal condition, when the tablets I
are no longer needed; but there are thou-
sands of robust men and women who
never eat a. meal witlvaut taking- one or
two of Stuart's Tablets, because by 30
doing they can eat what they please and
when they please and be free from any
bad after effects.
SruarYs Dyspepsia. Tablets are sold by
druggists everywhere in the United
States, Canada and Great Britain.

A Kentucky cashier is $200,000 short in his accounts
and he blames the races. He ought to be able to
sympathize with the story of the ass who tried to feed
in a field of thistles.
Superintendent of Schools Webster has resented the
interference of the Board of Supervisors in his affairs.
Perhaps he shares a very general belief that the board
has as much as it can do to mind its own business.
Lord Salisbury has decided, in condescending re
luctance, to accept a salary as Premier of England.
If it really pains him there is no doubt that some
of his influential friends can save him from the un
necessary infliction. ; â¢Â¦
His Highness the Mayor has been authorized by
the Supervisors to fell seven horses at auction. Here
at last is an opportunity for using our glorious muni
cipal flag; his Highness may drop it instead of the
hammer at the sale.
General Kitchener, it. is announced, intends to pur
sue in South Africa the dread tactics which made war
a horror of extermination in. North Africa. And
British statesmen still prate of the glories of their
civilization. . â¢
In the general shuffle which accompanies the la
bored efforts of our "reform" municipal administra
tion the city has lost several bronze lamps. Perhaps
some local Diogenes believes that he needs them all
in his business.
Norman Godkin von Galen, with blood as noble as
his name is long, has deserted the battlefields of
Luzon to be arrested for reading palms in-.Tacoma.
He should have- tried to turn his Own hands to ad

The police believe that they have captured,the thiei

fulness in the lease, as one feature of it will have to be
submitted to the Legislature for ratification. It i s not
likely, however, that any strong objection vvill be
made to it there. Every clause has been carefully con
sidered after prolonged investigation of all subjects
that in any way affect it or will be in any. way affected
by it. Commissioner Herold is quoted as saying:
*'\Vie feel that it is so drawn that the interests of the
State will be carefully guarded, and at the same time
the railroad company properly p-otected in its rights."
Prominent representatives of the Merchants' Associa-
AT last the lease of China Basin to the San Fran-
ClSCO and San Joaquin Valley Railroad has
been satisfactorily arranged, agreed upon, exe
cuted and signed. Thus another avenue has been
opened for the advancement of the interests of the city
and the State. All good tilings appear to be coming
to us at once. A tremendous victory for prosperity
was gained in the Presidential election, the abundant
rains have brought a promise of bountiful crops, the
Southern Pacific has passed under a new management
that will doubtless devote its energies to a strict at
tentiÂ«n to business, the gap in the coast road is about'
to be closed; the Pacific Commercial Museum has be
gun actual work, and now the lease of China Basin
gives a terminal in this city to a competing trans
continental road. With all those advantages to start
with, the coming year ought tq be a record-breaker
in the way of industrial and commercial activitv.
CHINA BASIN LEASE.
Iowa is to have a constitutional convention on her
hands without wishing it. The statutes of the State
provide that the question of calling such a convention
shall be submitted to the people every ten years, and
accordingly it was so submitted at the recent elec
tion. There was nothing to hold such a convention
for, and no argument was made upon it by either side.
Every one supposed it would be rejected as a matter
of course, but when the voters got to the polls they
voted affirmatively on every proposition and carried
the constitutional convention along with the rest. It
has been a great year in Iowa.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
What more does the spirit of the Great Khan ask,
through the body of President Martin of the New
University of Peking?
For every woman missionary Sacrificed by the
Eoxers 500 Chinese women have gone to torture and
death. For every man ordained for martyrdom a
thousand Chinese men have atoned with their lives.
For every missionary child cut down in its innocence
a hundred Chinese babies have been tossed and im
paled on Cossack spears. For every missionary com
pound burned or sacked value a hundredfold has been
looted in Tientsin and Pelting.
The murder of the missionaries was a great crime,
to be atoned for. The siege of the legations must b
avenged and some one* punished for it. But has not
slaughter of the Chinese gone far enough to more than
balance the ird ledger? If Dr. Martin is to be ap
proved by his Christian brethren, why should the
clergy of Denver reprehend the burning of Porter?
If we carry our religion abroad to be practiced in the
line of Dr. Martin's idea, why not practice it at home
in the same line?
Does Dr. Martin consider that phase of it? Does
he try to put himself in the place of China, over
run by foreigners, who enter a door opened by for
gery to attack all other forms of religion and mu
tually assault the sectarian forms by themselves pro
fessed? Does he consider the effect upon an ancient,
people of taking advantage of a forgery to attack the
moral foundations of a nation whose system was
ancient when the other existing world religions were
bora?
What is it all about? A French missionary forged
a clause into the treaty of i860 by which missionaries
v.ere to be free commoners in the Middle Kingdom.
They went there from many nations, leaving behind
them a greater need for their services than they found
in China. We do not say that all of them knew they
were protected by a forgery, but all might have
known it.
If Dr. Martin will indulge in a little introspection
he will probably see the spirit of the Great Khan in
side himself. As between him and the Empress Dow
ager we are inclined to think that warlike and crue!
shade would be more at home inside the president of
the new university of Peking.
REV. DR. MARTIN, president of the New Im
perial University of Peking, whatever that may
be, has indulged in an "open letter" in which
he chides all who advise moderation and mercy in
dealing with the Chinese. He sees the spirit of th.e
Great Khan in the withered body of the Empress
Dowager and desires to hit it hard. He says that no
punishment can be Â»od severe for the murder of the
â¢missionaries. The Great Khan, Genghiz the Con
cueror, used to be of the same opinion. - He boiled
victims in oil, burned them in great heaps, grilled
them in cities which he put to the torch, and the
blackened foundations of which he then plowed up
and sowed with salt. He built pyramids of skulls of
the slaughtered and strewed the world with their
bones. In earning out his policy, which was politico
religious, it was his opinion that no punishment was
too great for those who opposed him, and as an in
ventor of punishments he was a past master.
CHINA'S PENALTY.
While much can be done under the existing sys
tem in the way of redressing evils, a comprehensive
plan of encouraging mining and protecting the rights
of miners can hardly be effected until all governmental
work of any kind relating to the industry is placed
under one responsible head. For that reason the de
mand for the establishment of a national Department
of Mines is one of justice and expediency. The issue
should be strenuously urged upon Congress. It will
not be a forlorn hope fight by any means, for in all
sections of the Union there are powerful interests to
be served by it, and if the West take the lead there will
be no lack of supporters from the East and from the
Iâ RESOLUTIONS adopted by the Miners' Con
|â/ vention show that the amount of work which
will have to be done in the way of reform legis
lation to remedy existing evils is of sufficient magni
tude to fully justify the demand for the establishment
of a national Department of Mines and Mining. It
appears that almost every branch of the law affecting
the industry requires revision to some extent, and
such revision cannot be effectively carried out except
under the direction of a responsible head.
A brief review of the resolutions will show the na
ture of the evils complained of and the character of
the legislation desired. The passage of the measu-e
known as the "California mineral lands bill" is urged
for the purpose of "preventing the further absorption
by corporate interests of an area of land of great
value to the prospector and the miner"; the execu
tive committee of the association is instructed to test
in the courts the right of a miner to carry on hydraulic
mining when "holding a regularly issued license by
the Galifornia Debris Commission"; revision of ex
isting laws is recommended so as to "effectually check
the present injurious practice of holding mining
claims year after year without development"; Con
gress is called upon to put an end to the practice of
securing "as agricultural lands, by the use of so-called
scrip and otherwise, great tracts of the public domain
that are unquestionably mineral in character"; the
passage of an act by which "the location of petroleum
placer claims is so regulated as to secure to the miner
an opportunity to make technical discovery" is fa
vored; State legislation for the purpose of promoting
and protecting petroleum mining is called for; the
State is urged to be liberal in supporting the Mining
Bureau, the work of the Debris Commission is ap
proved and additional appropriations are recom
mended for its work, and forest preservation is urged
upon both the State and the nation.
With such an array of work on hand it is not
strange the convention should have included among
its resolutions one declaring: "That in the judgment
qi this association the mining industry of this country
with its output of raw material exceeding a billion oi
dollars in annual value, its tremendous significance to
the industrial prosperity of the nation and its still
ifrere splendid promise for the future, warrants and
demands the governmental protection and assistance
that can be adequately extended only through a Cab
inet department of the executive branch of the Gov
ernment. We therefore heartily indorse the now na
tional demand for a Cabinet Department of Mines and
Mining."
RESOLUTIONS OF THE MINERS.
LOS ANGELES TIMES-A!tcgether It
Is most unfortunate 'that a commission
was not appointed to represent California
at the Paris fair which would have gone
ahead .In a businesslike manner to make
a first class exhibit of our resources, for
the purpose of attracting settlers and
capital, after the fashion of the hlghly
successful exhibits that have been made
by Southern California at Chicago. San
Francisco, Atlanta and elsewhere. Major
Truman la reported to have remarked be
fore leaving for Europe that what the
Parisians wanted was to be entertained,
not instructed. He appears to have car
ried out his ideas on this point. Whether
the taxpayers o? California Trill approve
of such a programme remains to be seen.
One hundred and thirty thousand dollars
is a large sum to expend upon a good time
for half a dozen people, even if the hospi
tality of the State has been incidentally
exploited.
RIVERSIDE PRESSâ "We are not aware
who did the Job of estimating on the com
ing orange crop, which we believe orig
inated with the Los Angeles Evening Ex
press, and has been widely republished
since. The figures given are 25.0)0 car
loads, and we believe they are much too
high. Deducting the lemons we have not
shipped over 17,000 carloads of oranges for
1S93-1900, and to suppose that the com
ing crop will be 8000 cara more than that
is absurd. We have talked with a good
many fruit men In Southern California
about the matter, and the general consen
sus of opinion is that the crop will not be
much larger than last yearâ say 20,000 car
loads at the outside, with lemons enough
to make a total output of 22.000 cars. The
fruit will run more to large sizes this year
than last, but in the mature orchards
there is nothing to justify any prediction
of a large Increase In the total crop.
STOCKTON INDEPENDENT â The
army reorganization bill and the Nica
ragua Canal bill would make a splendid
record for the short session of Congress.
In addition to the regular appropriation
bills. There is not a great deal of time
for action during the short session and
the appropriation bills take a great deal
of attention. We hope, however, that
there may be a bill passed appropriating
a definite sum for water storage reser
voirs, even if the amount Is not over
$50,000 or $oO. As soon as a beginning Is
made then it will not be within the power
of one man to prevent appropriations here
after on the point of new legislation In an
appropriation bill.
CALAVERAS PROSPECTâ The action
of the general Government, recently, in
appointing three students of the Univer
sity of California to the task of charting
the Philippine Islands for the United
States is" worthy of more than passing
notice. It is an act that will tend greatly
to encourage practical education. "When
our universities can turn out students
capable of performing such a responsible
task, it shows that the work U good. The
three young men are members of the de
partment of civil engineers, and are ap
pointed on the recommendation of prom
inent professors of the institution.
In all his hHoousness, as witness the
Colorado incident.
FRESNO DEMOCRAT-Nero fiddling
while the Christians 3000 years ago were
being put to death and covered with pitch
set flre to to illumine the circus arena was
not the less barbaric and fiendish than
those 300 Lincoln County men who chained
a miserable negro ravlsher to an Iron rail,
poured kerosene on him and set fire to
him with a match. After all this boasted
civilization of ours Is but a thin veneer.
The savage man la in us all. --The veneer
cf civilization cracks every now and then
and exposes the savage and brutal man
SANTA ROSA REPUBLICANâ A flood
of moralizing may now be expected over
the burning In Colorado of a fiend who
richly deserved to die. While mob law
is generally to be deplored, if there ever
was a case in which it was excusable, this
is one. The men who took the law into
their own hands In this instance felt that
they were fully justified in what they
were doing and no utterances whatever
will cut any figure in the case. It will
be just as well to dismiss the matter with
the least possible discussion.
SAN LUIS OBISPO TRIBUNEâAccord
ing to the new plan of redlstrlcting the
State into Congressional districts, which
is now being carefully considered by the
Republicans of California, and which
will: be' submitted to the next session of
the Legislature for ratification, it is pro
posed to cut Los Angeles loose from the
counties which it has so long governed
and make that county a district by itself.
Good bye to Los Angeles. Half regretful,
and yet greatly pleased, are the people of
this section to lose it.
TULARE REGISTER-About the first
hard work we may expect Congress to
take hold of upon reassembling will be
the construction of the Nicaragua Canal.
The East Is for it now and the
combinations of the transcontinental rail
roads cannot prevail against the move
ment. There will be as little delay as pos
sible In beginning the work. â¢ The first
year of the new century will see the first
dirt thrown.
POMONA PROGRESSâ So many- prom
inent citizens of this communityâ lawyers,
educators and merchants â Insisted upon
taking plunge baths, or wading in water
with their shoes in their hands, in the
main business thoroughfares of the city
while the streets were flooded with water
on Saturday, that the City Trustees are
talking of passing an ordinance forbidding
bathing and wading barefoot In water In
the public streets.
RED BLUFF NEWS-Several towns In
the valley complain that there are not
houses enough in them to accommodate
the people who wish to make them their
homes. The reason given by real estate
men for not building houses to rent Is
that the coat of building Is so great that
the rents to be obtained are not sufficient
to pay interest on the investment.
FETAL.UMA ARGUSâ It has always
been pur opinion that In the matter of
primary election laws to govern the af
fairs of parties In their nominations and
manipulation of their own concerns, the
law should be very simple. The one thing
to provide against la fraud by rings and
bosses.
Late dispatches announce 'that our controversy
with Canada is at last to be settled, but without con
sideration to the Alaskan boundary, the critical point
at issue. Our English cousins no doubt like our
friendship, but are evidently determined to lose noth

In his view of policy and principle he is a destroyer
snd not a constructor, and his faculty for destruction
is carried into his party leadership. He found the
Democratic party in power and led it out and in each
of his campaigns led it further out, until now it is in
the wilderness, with no place to lay its head and no
head to lay if it had. Republicans are far from re
joicing that all this is so to the extent to which it is
so. The health of a party in power requires an op
position that is more than a mob or a memory. The
old Democracy is a memory, and the Bryan Democ
racy is a mob.
The hard background to all this iridescent vision
is the fact that Mr. Bryan has already made political
kindling-wood of two old parties, the Democratic and
Populist, and has left on the fence the hide of one
new one, the Silver Republican.
We are amazed at Mr. Washburn's moderation.
Why does he cut the Republican and Democratic
parties into thirds? Why not pass the whole of each
tc Bryan on a silver platter and invite him to go an*l
be inaugurated without further formality, while Hill,
Gorman and Croker sit listening to the tick-tack of
"the machine"? *
All right. But a word right here. Mr. Washburn
will need the services of more "repeaters" than history
tc make such a movement win.
Mr. Washburn then abandons himself to frenzy, in
vhich he prophesies that: "Although unsuccessful at
the polls. Bryan is s mightier man than his suc
cessful opponent. He is the greatest political cru
sader the world has ever seen. He stands alone. He
13 enough of a political genius to become the
founder of a great new party, even as Jefferson
founded the Democratic and Lincoln the Republican
party. Millions of men would enthusiastically rally to
his standard under these new conditions. It is not
extravagant to say that Bryan would thus hold two
thirds of the Democratic party and would soon at
tract at least one-third of the Republicans. These,
together with the other reform forces, would give him
before the next election a majority of the voters of the
country-" Where now is Colonel Sellers?
Mr. Washburn declares that Mr. Bryan "will not
again become the candidate of the Democratic party.
He will not surrender to that element. He will not
repudiate his record. He will not disappoint his
friends. But he can lead to victory a new party, con
ducted on safe and conservative yet progressive lines.
Therefore, to hold what we have 'and maintain our
present momentum a new party must be formed.
This can be accomplished by uniting the Bryan Dem
ocrats, Bryan Republicans, Populists and other
smaller bodies." We make no quarrel with Mr.
Washburn for talking about a new party, that is not
born yet nor christened, "holding what it has, and
maintaining its present momentum," but pass on to
his description of what is to happen when it is born,
named, and holding the momentum and things which
it had before its own existence. He proposes that
after it is created there shall be added to it "The
strong personality and masterful leadership of Bryan,
and history would repeat itself in the rapid assembling
of patriots to uphold and preserve the national honor
under the inspiration of the Lincoln of the new cen
tury."
His proclamation is very rhapsodical. He charac
terizes the union of Populists, Silver Republicans and
so forth, on the Chicago and Kansas City platforms as
eh unwise "attempt to put new wine into old bottles."
That Scriptural reference as to the jugging of new
wine arose out of the fact that the bottles spoken of
were pigskins, and the ne.v wine burst them and was
wasted. Therefore it is that Mr. Washburn considers
the Democratic name and organization as a pigskin,
and an old one at that, unable to bear the pressure. of
such effervescent contents as Populism and the other
political vagaries which sent the brains of the old
Democracy out of the party and failed to bring any
new brains in to take their place. Mr. Washburn
frankly states that the pigskin will go back to the con
trol of "Gorman, Hill and Croker and the old ma
chine regime they represent." That is to say, if there
is anything left of the Democracy which went on a
debauch at Chicago and failed to sober up at Kansas
City, the three worthies named may have it, and
go to!
Among these the most excited seems to be Mr.
George F. Washburn, president of the Bryan Clubs
of Massachusetts. Mr. Washburn does not take the
preliminary precaution to confer with anybody. He
sits down and makes a new party out of his own head
and invites approving 'and admiring correspondence
as to his head and handiwork.
THE St. Paul conference between Mr. Towne,
Mr. Shively and other committcemen and sup
porters of Mr. Bryan, in the Middle West,
which had for its purpose examination of the wreck
of Democracy wrought by the new departure of 1896.
has roused other political architects and new party
THAT NEW PARTY AGAIN
NEW YORK TRIBUNEâ It would be
not altogether amiss to paraphrase the
creed of the wise man cited by Andrew
Fletcher to Montrose. and to nay, "Let*
me control the railroads of a nation and I
care not who makes its treaties and its
lawa." That would be within the limits
of. discretion, at any rate, in the case of
such a country as China la to-day. Dip
lomats may make treaties for open doors
and what not. The practical execution of
those treaties will lie In the actual open
ing up of the country through the exten.
sion of railroad lines. The function of the
diplomat Is as essential as ever, but it
must be supplemented, or perhaps more
properly complemented, by that of the
engineÂ«r. Civilization may sometimes get
forward upon a powder cart, but the rail
road car In its more general and more ef
fective vehicle of progress.
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER-So long
as *ttÂ£ present situation continues what
is thcTjse of saying and of pretending to
believe that there is no longer any sec
tionalism in the country; that the divi
sion between North and South has been
ended; that we are ail a happy band or
brothers? There is sectionalism, section
alism of the worst and most dangerous
k'.nd, and it is the part of wisdom to rec
ognize the fact and so consider by what
means, if by any. the evil can be cured.
It is no use denouncing the South for the
attitude which it persists in maintaining.
It has Its reasons which it deems suffi
cient and upon which it has a right to
act. The thing to do Is to find out if there
is any way of convincing the Southern
mind that the attitude Is one for Â¦which
there is no occasion and which ought to
be abandoned.
HARTFORD COURANT-Now how
long will the South maintain Us solidity?
For one thing, it Is becoming rapidly a
commercial instead of & purely agricul
tural region. Cotton is not only grown
there; it Is also spun and woven. Mills
are springing up with an abundance and
a success that the mill men of Massachu
setts do not need to be told of. Cities are
growing, and, even this year, there was a
decided opposition to Mr. Bryan, though
it was not openly expressed. His defeat
has brought no regrets there. Several
States, by methods that are altogether
unjustifiable and indefensible, have prac
tically disfranchised the negro. But the
one explanation offered by Southern peo
ple for their proverbial solidity has been
the innate opposition to alliance with the
colored voters.
SPRINGFIELD REPUBLICANâSome
thing practical In the way of expansion
is in contemplation by the States General
of Holland, namely, the draining of the
Zuyder Zee,, that great grulf which 400
years ago was created in the heart of the
Netherlands by the Incursion of the sea.
Around Its border are what are known as
the "dead cities." and beneath them
nearly a thousand square miles of land.
A scheme of partial reclamation was de
termined on some two years ago, preserv
ing the deep-water channels and a small
er lake; but now. it appears, this is to be
substituted by a complete drainage of the
vast area. Much of the ancient beauty
and charm of those "dead cities" will be
taken away, but when accomplished Hol
land's people will be much richer.

man's steadfastness, the Scandinavian's

still higher praise. He asserts that they

LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNALâ
The evil of the Increase of divorces fa

reptitiously obtainedTv But divorce Is the
consequence and not ' the cause of the
breaking up of families. Its chief cause
is inconsiderate marriages. Where civil
divorces are not allowed, there Is apt to
be a great deal of immorality resulting.
While there are a few persons who con
tract the divorce habit, the majority of
those who get divorces either remain sin

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
These are illustrations of the rapidity with which
Pacific Ocean shipping is advancing, and as Congress
will in all probability pass the shipping bill this win
ter, the rate of expansion in the next few years will be
greatly increased. Thus it will be seen we are none
too early in arranging for an increase of wharf room,
and the city, the State and the railroads are to be con
gratulated on the good prospect that such increase
will be speedily attained.
In commenting upon the need of increased wharf
age Mr. Irving M. Scott gave some 'figures that are
interesting. He said: "Since June of this year ves
sels aggregating 250,000 tons intended for use oh the
Pacific have been contracted for, and during the year
ending June 30 vessels were finished or contracted for
aggregating 350,000 tons. Among these were seventy
six steamers, of which ten are of 10,000 tons each.
Hill is having two monster steamers of 33,000 tons
loaded displacement built, the Pacific Mail two of
18.000 tons displacement, and there are on the ways
in this city two steamers of 16,500- tons loaded dis
placement for the American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company. John D. Spreckels is having three steam
ers Â¦ of 6000 tons each built. Captain Dollar has a
large steamer on the ways, and â¢ the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company is building a fast steamer to run
between San Francisco and Seattle."
The benefits to result from the establishment of a
railroad terminal at the basin are many. The first will
be the improvement of that section of the water front
and a large district of the city adjoining it. The in
creased wharfage that will result from the improve
ment will in itself be of immense advantage to us at
this juncture, when there is such urgent need of
greater facilities for shipping.
tion, who from the first have taken a keen interest in
the lease and have- studied every feature of. it,
have also cordially commended the terms in which it
is drawn. Being thus satisfactory to the officers of tha
State, the representatives of the* railroad and to the
merchants of the city, it is hardly likely a valid ob
jection can be- made to it on any score.

MANAGERS OF BAN FRANCISCO.
Although by divine dispensation and the elec
tion of the electors of the Roman-German em
pire we have been raised to a dlsmlty which
leaves nothing to be desired by way of title or
consideration, yet It must be our care as ruler
of the house and monarchy of Austria to see
that its perfect equality of title and hereditary
dignity with the greatest European powers be
maintained and confirmedâ an equality due to
the sovereigns of the house of Austria, both
by its ancient glory and In consequence of the
size and population of its states which com
prise extensive kingdoms and Independent
principalities and secured by International
treaties and practice. Therefore, for the perma
nent conflrmatron of this perfect equality of
rank we are prompted and Justified, in accord
ance with the example In the last century of the
Russian imperial court and now of the new
The fulfillment of the peace of Lunevllle
involved the dissolution of the holy Ro
man empire. The fabric of states, secu
lar and religious, monarchies and repub
lics, embracing both Germany and Italy,
the political counterpart of the church,
under the headship of the Emperor of the
Romans, the secular counterpart of the
Pope, after having weathered the
Protestant revolution and survived the
thirty years' war, was now to meet Its
doom at the hands of the new Charle
magne and to pass on its inheritance at
his behest to the empire of the French.
Uts end really came, although nominally
It lasted a few years more, with the de
cree of the Diet In 1S03 parceling the
ecclesiastical states and free cities
among a few leading princes. The dis
tribution of the spoil waa practically
dictated by Napoleon and the real work
of this reorganization of Germany was
done in Paris under his eye. The prince*
fairly scrambled for the spoil, and
through their agents lobbied desperately
for Talleyrand's â¢ favor, sparing neither
money nor self-respect.
Having things in his own hands Napo
leon planned to weaken Austria and to
establish several other states in Ger
many strong enough to prevent the re
covery of Austria, but not strong enough
to dispense with his protection. Austria's
gain was therefore small and her real
loss Immense, for the ecclesiastical states,
which all disappeared but, one, and the
imperial cities, of which only six had been
spared, had long been her faithful clients.
Prussia gained In size and compactness,
exchanging 127,000 subjects west of the
Rhine for 600,000 in Westphalia and Thur
ingia, Baden, Hesse, Darmstadt. Wurt
temberg and Bavaria all made large
gains. Bavaria in particular was in
creased by a population of 300,000 and
rendered more compact.
This wholesole absorption of petty sov
erignties and the establishment In their
stead of a few states of moderate size
was an immense step to the unification
of the German people. It cleared the
ground. But something more was need
ed before a new Germany could rise from
that foundation. Unity of heart and ac
tion must needs precede political unity,
and, for this, too, Germany was indebted
to Napoleon. It was the scourge of the
conqueror that awoke the German na
tional feeling and created a common pa
triotism after conquest had stricken off
the bonds of petty despotism. The new
life that came to Germany through the
reforms of Napoleon and his client
Princes made the humiliation of subjec
tion to France all the more keen. .
Napoleon looked upon himself as the
successor of Charlemagne and as Charle
magne had been crowned emperor of the-
Romans and thereby assumed the politi
cal headship of Europe, so for Napoleon
the assumption of the same title was the
logical step when he had attained to a
similar position. During the middle ages
and practically until the entry of Rus
sia into western European politics the po
sition and title of emperor were unique.
There was but one emperor as there was
but one pope. They were in politics and
religion the heads of Christendom. Con
sequently the assumption of the title of
emperor by Napoleon and the reality of
his sway over western Europe expose!
the house of Hapsburg to a new and
strange peril. Having been emperors for
centuries, must they now sink to the level
of mere kings? Must Francis II, "em
peror of the Romans always august." be
come merely a king of Hungary aad Bo
hemia and yield the first place in the
precedence of Europe for one behind
France, Spain. England? It was unthink
able. Hardly had the Intention of Napo
leon to take the title of emperor of tne
French become known than Francis II
resolved to constitute t.he Austrian lands
an empire. This step was as unprecedent
ed and revolutionary as that of Napoleon
and, like It. could hardly be taken with
out some assurance of recognition. Napo
leon assumed the title of emperor May
18, 1S04. and from May until August Fran
cis bargained to secure in return for
recognizing the establishment of the em
pire of the French Napoleon'a recognition
of the transformation of Austria into a
hereditary empire. 'August 14 Vienna was
astonished bv the following proclamation:
Concurrently the area of France is ex
tended beyond har "natural" boundaries
by the annexation of Piedmont and the
LJgurlan republic (Genoa) and the Bour
bons In Naples are dethroned by procla
mation and their mainland territories as
signed to Joseph Bonaparte as King.
Within a few yeara the old Italy waa as
completely transformed as Germany. In
1S07 the kingdom of Etruria was Incor
porated with France: in 1S0S the eastern
part of the papal states was annexed tfÂ»
the kingdom of Italy, and in 1S09 the re
mainder of the papal states was added to
France. As in Germany, the ground wax
now swept â¢ clear of the political debris
of the middle ages and prepared for a
new and united Italy.

In describing the dissolution of the em
pire the train of^events which forced this
action on Francis has >>een anticipated.
The campaign of Austerlitz was Immedi
ately followed by the treaty of Prpshurg,
by which Austria was hustled out of Ger
many and Italy, and her new "empire"
restricted to those of her former territo
ries Inhabited mainly by Slavs and Hun
garians. Bavaria, "Wurttembere and Ba
den received the spoil of Austria, and the
two former were erected into kingdoms.
The absorption of petty sovereignties, so
extensive in 1S03. was now carried through
completely.
The new states In Germany took their
place as vassals of Napoleon through the
formation of thÂ« confederation of thÂ«
Rhine. This new union, whose members
severed their connection with the old em
pire, was made up of the archbishopric of
Regensburg. the kingdoms of Bavaria and
"Wurttemberg. the grand duchies of Ba
den, Hesse. Berg. Nassau and some small
er states. It comprised about 40.000 square
miles and a population of 8.000,000 people.
The confederation of the Rhine consti
tuted in reality a vast protective cushion
for France against the attacks of the al
lied powers. It was bound to furnish Na
poleon, who was entitled protector of the
confederation, 63,000 troops In war, and.
later, when its area was increased and its
population doubled. 120.000. To the north
this protective fringe of client monarch*
is extended to the sea by the forcible
transformation of the Batavlnn republic *
in 1S06 Into the kingdom of Holland, with
Napoleon's brother lLouls upon the throno.
Meanwhile the changes In Italy were in
harmony with those l\> Germany. The as
sumption of the imperial crown carried
with It, following the example of Charle
magne, kingship in Italy. In 1S02 Napo
leon had reorganized the Cisalpine repub
lic as the republic of Italy, of which hs
became President; In March. 1S03. the re
public becomes a monarchy and Napo
leon assumes the title of the King of It
aly. The new kingdom was enlarged Â«i
year later by the cession from Austria of
Venetia.
ruler of France. In bestowing upon the houÂ»Â» of
Austria In respect to Its Independent states the
hereditary Imperial title.
Napoleon crowned himself hereditary
emperor of the French December 2. 1S0J.
and on the 7th Francis II. "emperor oi
the Romans elect always Augustus," be
came also Francis I. "hereditary emperor
of Austria." By thl-s adroit move the
new empire of Austria, a modern,
arbitrary creation like the empire
of the French, owing to thÂ« long
and intimate relations between the house
of Austria and the holy Roman empire
was abla to glidÂ«Â» Into Us shoes, receive
Its mantle and consequently to masque
rade In European politics as an ancient
empire bo successfully that outside of
Germany the old empire- has disappeared
from the common stock of historical
knowledge almost as completely as it has
from existence.
For eighteen months Francis II bore
the double title of Roman empÂ«ror-elect
and hereditary emperor- of Austria, bu!
Napoleon's victories In 1S05 and the con
sequent formation of the confederation
of the Rhine *avÂ© the finishing stroke
to the old empire, whose formal dissolu
tion came In August. 1SOÂ«. On the 1st of
August Napoleon announced to thw Diet
of the empire that he could no longer rec
ognize the existence- of the German con
stitution, and at the flrst opportunity
Frands II, In a proclamation (Au
gust 6). declaring It no longer possibla
to fulfill the duties of the imperial offlc*
owing to the changes that had taken
place In Germany, especially the forma
tion of the union of Rhenish states, form
ally announced that the empire was dis
solved and laid down the Imperial crown.
Freeing his German province 1 * and im
perial lands from all their obligations to
the German empire and uniting them as
emperor of the Austrian state, he woulrt
strive to restore them to prosperity, etc.
Thus, calmly and coldly, the holy Roman
empire wa9 consigned to the grave. It
had outlived Its day. and. llkÂ« a great
man who Ions survives his activity an<!
fame. It passed away almost unnoticed,
leaving the papacy alone as a visible sur
vival of the Imperial fabric of ancient
Rome.

THE SAK FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 23,1900.
Theatrical Managers' Fund Generously Increased by the
Second Annual Benefit at the Orpheum.
ACTORS AND SINGERS GIVE ,
THEIR BES T FOR CHARITY
The Leando brothers from the Chutes
did astonishing acrobatic feats, and Stell
lng and Revelle, comedy horizontal bar
artists, closed the programme.
Walter Damrosch was to have accom
panied Bispham. but illness prevented his
attendance. Max Hlrschfeld, musical di
rector of the Tivoll, played the accom
paniment in his stead, and also for Signor
Castellano. the tenor, who sang later.
Eddie Mack of the Olympia did some
clever buck and wing dancing. Max "Wal
don of the Orpheum pleased the audience
with his female Impersonations.
The Alcazar company presented act 3
from "The Railroad of Love." a dainty
gem of comedy, given with the delicate
touch of true artists.
Anna Boyd of the Orpheum sang sev
ernl character songs. \
The Tlvoli Opera Company pang Feveral
choruses from "The Jolly Musketeers "
and Annie Myers and Ferris Hartman
were received with the favor always ac
corded them.
Mme. Rosa Olitzka of the Grau Opera
Company was next on the programme.
She sang "Indian Serenade," by George
Liebling, and "Habanera," from "Car
men." The applause was enthusiastic and
Olitzka graciously gave an encore.
David Bispham unquestionably carried
off the honors of the benefit. He sang
Damrosch's "Danny Deever" with a dra
matic Intensity that clutched the heart
strings. When he had finished the audi
ence broke into applause that was almost
hysteric and lasted until the great bary
tone responded with an encore.
Conditt and Morey of the Orpheum pre
sented a sketch, "The Tie That Binds,"
and the McCoy sisters and Sam Marion
of the Alhambra did clever acrobatic
dancing,' and singing that was not quite
acrobatic.
No onÂ© complained of not getting: his
money's worth. The programme began,
at 1 o'clock and was not concluded until
a quarter of 6. Opera eingers, actors, vau
deville artists, dancers and acrobats had
offered their services freely, and the only
embarrassment suffered by the managers
was that caused by the superabundance
of talent. The programme was well
chosen, but the order in which the num
bers were put on was not always happy â
as, for illustration, when, a clog dancer
from the Olympia came on to entertain
the audience before it had settled back to
earth from the clouds where David Blsp
ham's voice had carried It. But in general
no criticism was heard among the audi
tors and every participant, whether grand
opera singer or "knockabout artist." was
accorded a generous reception. In fact,
the insistent audience, demanding en
cores early in the entertainment; was
partly responsible for the undue length
of the programme.
Young women who are generally seen
by rne public only , across the footlights
sold souvenir programmes at the door and
in the aisles, ana in this manner several
hundred dollars were added to the gener
ous sum realized from the sale of tickets.
fr^g-^HE best that all of the theaters'
I have on their bills was offered at
1 the Orpheum yesterday afternoon
[I for the entertainment of those
who attended the benefit of the
charity fund of the Associated Theatrical
Managers of San Francisco. The audi
ence, which filled the theater to standing
room capacity. Included a noticeably large
number of theatrical people. AH of the
profession now in San Francisco and not
behind the scenes were in frontof the cur
tain.
W. J. Hynes pleased the audience with
his monologue and songs, ending with his
old-time laughing song.
Dolan and Lenharr of the Orpheum gave
"A Strange Adventure," a laughable
travesty on "The Sporting Duchess."
Congressman Julius Kahn, an actor
himself in his young days and still the
actor's friend, was Introduced for a few
remarks in explanation of the use of the
money obtained by the benefit. He said
that theatrical people were always flrst
to come forward in aid of other charities,
and when they asked the patronage of
the public for a charity within their pro
fession they were careful to give patrons
their money's worth in entertainment.'
Harry Orndorft acted as stage manager
and also announced the numbers, the
order of which was changed from that of
the programme.
After an overture by Roaner's Hun
garian orchestra the Brothers Martine or
the Orpheum opened the entertainment
with their funny acrobatic feats. lone
MacLouth. also of the Orpheum, Bang
Scotch songs most acceptably. â¢
The Royal Italian Marine Band, from the
California, played the second act and
sextet from "Lucia" and Lorraine's "Sa
lome." The audience applauded enthusi
astically and would* not be denied. For
Its encore the band played the "American
Patrol."
They were vigilant and persuasive, and if
any one slipped through their nets he
must have felt himself to be very small
fry indeed. Those who sold programmes
were: Misses Rose Ashcroft, Blanche
Woodman, Frances Stewart, Mabel
Hilliard, Josie Davis, Julia Cotte, Hazel
Kilday, Ollie Hefforn, Violet "Voldaire and
Mana Barman. The programme had an

A bit of the life of the late Jesse Sheldon
Potter and the conditions that surrounded
hia last hours /will be learned from the
lips of witnesses in a suit which will go
to trial before Judge Daingerlleld and a
jury to-day. Ann'e J. Pronk, whom the
defense openly charges with having been
an inmate of a well known Elli?-strect
resort, is the plaintiff in the action, and
sho seeks to recover 13460 from decedent's
estate "tor services rendered him as -a
nurse and attendant during his illness
from April 6 to September 4, 1899."
The case was called for hearing yes
terday, but owing to a delayed train,
which prevented J. C. Campbell, plain
tiff's counsel, from completing his prep
arations for the trial a continuance until
this morning was ordered. Miss Pronk.
who is an attractive woman,, about 30
years of uge, sat beside her attorney and
took an active Interest In the proceedin&a.
It was at a time when Potter wa,s oc
cupying bachelor's quarters downtown
that he met Miss Pronk. According to her
complaint they met frequently, and when
he was taken ill on April 5 he summoned
her to his apartments to nurse him back
to health and strength. She remained at
his bedside until September 4, Miss Pronk
claims, and as he told her he would pay
her well for her services she demands $29
a day for such, her bill aggregating the
sum stated.
AVhen the claim was filed with the rep
resentatives of the Potter estate It was
rejected on the ground that the deceased
was not ill and in need of a nurse during
the dates mentioned by the plaintiff. The
defense also claims that the suit was sim
ply brought for the purpose of extorting
money from the estate and has no â¢ sub
stantial basis in fact.^&s&SPCBPf
Miss Pronk declares she has proofs to
substantiate her claim, however, and says
she has no fear of the questions which
will be asked her on cross-examination.

NEW YORK. Nov. 22â There was the same
ebb and flow in to-day'e dock market that has
characterized it for several days past. Neither
the beginning nor the end. however, was so
veil defined as they were yesterday. The cur
rents and cross-currests were very confusing
all day and made it difficult to analyze the
tone, except during a period of pronounced re
action, which developed after the oj>enir.g. and
an equally j>ronounced recovery before the close.
The close itself was reactionary and weak under
the influence of a violent break of 4Vi points in
American Steel and Wire. That stock got up
to 11 In the general rally of the market, but
plunged downward to Â«6* 4 in a few minutes and
closed about there, with heavy offerings etill
coming on the market. The professional trad
ers in Wall street have worked for some time
In the faith that they were following the bull
ltadei-ehi^ of a combination cf forces between
the naoet notable speculator In the street and a
newer tind almost equally dashing operator who
made his mark, and a deep one at that in the
speculation in steel etocks during the last year
and & half. The break In Eteel and Wire com
ing near home to this alleged speculative com
bination, served to unsettle sentiment very con
siderably at the close. The bear contingent suc
ceeded in pretty well getting the upper hand
early in the day. The market opened with
price currents moving In whirling eddies. There
was continued absorption in some of yester
day-s etror.g stocks, the local tractions -Â»nd St.
Paul being conspicuous. Later a etrongMemand
developed for Chesaueak and Ohio on buvlne
eaid to be for Philadelphia account. This Btock
moved up an extreme Z%. This movement was
however, not sufficient to discourage the profit!
taking and bear pressure, which had been mo'e
or less manifest, especially In the steel stocks
from the opening, and the whole market fell
away without much support to the lowest of
the day. The rally w*s Inaugurated in St
Paul. That stock was boosted to nearly 13.)
and the other grangers. Sugar and the locai
tratetion stocks and General Electric made the
readiest response. An effort was made to con
tinue the movement by the time-honored device
of bidding up the Vanderbilts. but this proved
unavailing In face of the acute weakness ehown
by the steel stocks. The news of the day was
little regarded. Some disappointment was felt
at th* cessation of yesterday* heavy demand
from London. That center turned seller to-dav
to the extent of about 40,000 shares on balance
There was a failure of expected heavy demand
for clocks from the West, which was cut off
from wire communication yesterday The beari
were also inclined to make capital out of the
reported dispute among the diplomats at Pek'n^
and their tactics were ehown in the circulat'on
of a rumor that the Czar was dead The fart
that these rumors were given some weight and
that the Kruger demonstration In Mare'eitles
and the reported injury to General Roberts lATa
an ir-Huence. tend to show that the movement
of the market was to a large extent on sentl
rner.tal crounds. The money market showed
no signs of any stress from the large specula
tion and was appreciably easier on the lar^
receipts of Australian gold here during the
wee*. Sterling exchange hardened on the large
telling of stocks by London. H is conjectured
also that sterling exchange is being accumu
lated with a view to New York subscription, to
loreii^i loans.
The bond market was notably strong In *i>ott
but weakened at other points. Total eales t>ar

CHICAGO, Nov. 22.â The corn pit was crowd

kets being almost deserted by traders. No
vember opened at from 45c to 45%c and *oon
touched 47c under heavy bidding, but Mr.
Phillips, who Is credited with controlling' that
option, sold a few 5000-bushel lots and a re
action followed. A sale was made at 44c, but
it was a fiuke, as the market really stood at
44"jc. The market became much quieter toward
the close. Acceptances were light an3 the
weather was reported as again being unfavor

were firm and receipts light. These factor*
caused a better tone, following easiness at the
start, when the bearlshness of local trader*

WHEAT- Liverpool was firm, but dull. Paris
was weak. New York was a couple of frac
tions firmer. Chicago opened steady to firm,
with a light local trade but a good and In
creasing shipping demand, 300,000 bushels being
taken for the latter account, with more or
ders expected. Hamburg cabled to accept all
orders, as Argentine news was bad.- The sea
board reported good Continental acceptances.
It was expected that the visible supply next
Monday would not show any further increase,
as receipts are falling off. Last year at this
time the visible increased 2,000,000 bushels.
There Is now a good domestic demand for
Wheat, and that for Flour Is Improving. The
Northwest Is selling freely, though there is
very little Wheat left up North. Liverpool is
responding better than of late, and the situa
tion seems better all around.
The local market showed no change worthy
of note.

UNION LABOR WINS
VICTORY IN COURT
Jury Decides That Geider
Is Not Entitled to
Damages.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Nov. 22.
A Jury in Justice Qulnn's court decided,
after deliberating a few minutes this
evening, that John Geider was not en
titled to 1239 damages against the Interna
tional Cigar-makers' Union No. 253 of
America, for causing him a loss of busi
ness by means of a boycott. The jury w<w
rot unanimous in Its decision, standing
nine to three when polled at the request
of the plaintiff's attorney, and It Is likely
that an appeal will be taken.
The trial of the case has been going on
for the last five days and there has been
present every day a large representation
of labor union men. Great Interest was
taken in the outcome, for upon It depeno
ed In a measure the right of labor unions
to declare boycotts against persons who
antagonize them.<
Gelder's offenses against the union date
back, according to the official organ of
the trade, to 1S97. when he was under sus
pension for non-payment of dues. He is
charged with selling Chinese-made cigars,
placing labels en non-union cigars, repre
senting them as union-made and misrep
resenting the label to consumers of cigars
during the time of his suspension, which
he had no right to do. For these viola
tions of union law he was fined $25. which
he refused to pay. Subsequently Geider
was boycotted and union men were for
bidden 'to trade with him, notices and
circulars having been sent to all the labor
organizations in the vicinity.
A specific case against Geider Is that he
1* alleged to have sold a box of non-union
cigars to a union blacksmith named
Perry, representing it to contain union
made goods. When Perry discovered that
the box did not bear the label he brought
it back to GHder. who put an Interna
tional Labor Union '.abel upon it. stating
that was sufficient. It developed during
the trial that the International label is
not valid unless accompanied by the seal
of the Pacific Coast Blue Label League.
Gelder's father, who was nut on the
stand this morning, stated that it was his
understanding that It Is not a rule of tho
unions that union labels should be put on
good cigarsâ that they were only meant
to be put on the cheaper brands. In reply
to questions b*Â» uaid that he considered
a cigar at *G0 a thousand one of the
pheaDer brands.
J. Fibusch was put on by the defense in
rebuttal of Geider to show that a $0) cigar
Is a good cigar. He *ald that he had ai
wayÂ« understood that the union required
labels on all cigars, whether they were
cheap or good. He was substantiated in
hi* statements by Levl Barr and J. F.
Bima.
The entire afternoon wan taken up with
thÂ»* arguments. Attorney J. E. McElroy
called the Jury's attention to the rules
of the International Cigar-makers' Union,
which required that the coast label should
accompany the International Union label
and pointed out Gelder's direct violation
of them and his defiance of all union laws.
Attorney McVev. for the plaintiff, said
that It had not been shown that a rule
of the kind had ever been adopted. Tt
required written rules to prove that
Geider had violated any particular mlo
end not one that had become recognized
by custom.

it was Bryan swept the State by 15,000.

evening? If you do not you cer
tainly are not up to date, and you
will be overlooking one of the most fash

given In this city.
The sweet little tots of the San Francis
co Nursery for Homeless Children are
going to spend a happy Tuletide if the
ladles who compose the board of directors
of this worthy society can have their say
about it; but it costs money even to make
children happy and comfortable. That is
why the "Nursery Levee" Is to be held to
morrow afternoon and evening at thÂ©
Palace.
Charming society buds who have never
sung outside the shadows of a drawing
room have kindly come forward and vol
unteered to sing. Ladles skilled in art
decorations" paintings and all things that
add an artistic finish, to a room have
donated i articles to be sold. Among the
rood things that are down on the pro
gramme is a cake walk specialty by little
Harold Borchers and a piano solo by Miss

REFUSE TO PLAY
A LEAGUE GAME
Yesterday afternoon Engineer Le Conte
was busy at the hour of adjournment ex
plaining how he had placed a valuation
on horses. This afternoon the session
closed with the expert explaining upon
what theory he valued "boats and barRes"
at San Leandro Lake at $750. Judge Hart
abruptly aujourned court at 4:21 o'clock
while Le Conte and Hayne were discuss
ing sluiceway valuations.
The water company has the Le Conte
valuation of the plant in 1SRG In evidence.
It Is now supplementing that report with
the present day estimates of the same en
gineer based Boardman's figures.
Engineer Boardman. who has been in the
employ of one or ,'the other of the com
bined corporations since 18S6, was not
asked a question concerning constructioij
after 1S86.
Starting with the Le Conte-Boardman
combination of estimates for 1884, the
water company has added Its valuations
upon construction since then, and thrown
In the valuation which William J. Dlngee
and Expert Adams have placed on the
Oakland Water Company's plant. After
Le Conte has been retired from the stand,
the water company still has experts
Schuyler of San Francisco and Klerstad
of Kansas City to examine.
The Boardman and the Le Conte esti
mates as to quantities of material do not
entirely agree. For example, to-day a
question of sluices was raised. Le Conte's
figures showed five miles at $2000 a mile;
Boardman's figures were three miles.
This discrepancy was noted by Attorney
Hayne as an evidence of the conditions
under which the expert testimony is going
upon the record of the case.
That same year Le Conte furnished the
city of Oakland with an Independent esti
mate of valuation, but It appears from
his testimony that he was compelled to
rely upon what the late Anthony Chabot
had told him about construction.
It was apparent from Hayne's cross
examination to-day that he had started a
hot campaign to do a lot of smashing of
expert testimony.
The further peculiarity in Le Conte' s
estimates is the fact that he was given a
lot of estimates of quantities of material,
etc., used In construction, made by Engi
neer Boardman. Upon these estimates He
placed his valuation without regard for
the existence of any of the work, the
water company depending upon Board
man for figures only upon the condition
of the works in 18S6.
Engineer L. J. Le Conte Is In part re
sponsible, according to his evidence on
cross-examination to-day, for this lump
ing of valuations. His testimony also dis
closed a remarkable system, of doubling
up In estimates. Mr. Le Conte Informed
Attorney Hayne that he had Included "In
a broad, general way" in his figures upon
numerous items of construction all of the
tools and other paraphernalia required for
the work specified. Following that by a
process of close questioning, Attorney
Hayne also ascertained that the expert
had made separate and specific valuations
upon those same tools. So the city's coun
sel finds that this peculiar system ac
counts in some measure for the millions
of valuation which are going into evi
dence. ' i-
The "lump sum" method of placing a
valuation on the Contra Costa Water
Company's property for purposes of reve
nue only has been developed as one of. the
ways that Items of $10,000 and upward are
being piled on to the enormous total which
the water company claims as the worth
of its plant.

Attorney Nutter made the sensational
charge in the afternoon that Martin and
Mrs. Stella. Williams had arranged to get
Williams In a quarrel by himself, kill
him and then swear the killing was justi
fiable. He accused Martin of breaking up
Williams' home, and his sensations
startled the spectators frequently.
BTOCKTON. Nov. 22.â W. B. Nutter
spoke to-day for the -defense) of Captain
Williams, the slayer of William Martin of
Oakland. Tbe jury will be instructed by
Judge Jones in the morning. Mr. Nutter
denied the contention of the prosecution
that the burden of -proof in a murder trial
rested with the defense. District Attorney
Ashley stated yesterday In his argument
that when the lacta of the shooting were
proven as they wore admitted In the Wil
liams trial, the burden of proof rested
with the defense. Jf the latter was not
able to prove that the killing was cither
excusable or justifiable then the jury
should convict.

Captain Benson Injured.
Stories of the storm are still coming in.
Some of ;- them are laughable and some
are serious. Captain Benson of the Zin
fandel thinks the gale was no laughing
matter, btitr nevertheless, he has to laugh
when he thinks , of how he ,came to be
knocked out. The Zinfandel was on her
way from Napa to San Francisco when
the gale came up. Captain Benson was
Just going on watch. The steamer! was
rounding a curve when a gust of Wind
threw her against a' bank and the wheel
went around like a- top. The rudder had
struck a ledge and that threw, the , wheel
over. Captain Benson attempted to seize
it and was thrown on his. heam ends,
breaking his ieg in two places, against
the cabin wall. On the arrival of 'the
steamer here he ' was removed to a hos
pital and Is now, doing fairly well..

The Oceanic Steamship Company's llar
iposa got away late last night for Aus
tralasia. It Is many a moon since a' steam
ship left San Francisco with such a pas
senger list. When Captain Howard, super
intendent of the steamship line, learned
how many passengers were going, he at
once cut short on the freight, and the re
sult is that nearly 500 tons of freight is
lying on the wharf. The passengers will
get the benefit and the freight will not
suffer.

SAILING OF THE MABIPOSA.
R. H. Wakefield Underbids Three Local Firms for the
. Biggest Water-Front Contract So. Far Let.
ONCE more an outside. contractor
has come in and captured a big
contract from under the hands of
the local men. This time it Is R.
v H. Wakefleld of Portland, and
the contract he has Becured is the big
gest plum the Harbor Commission has had
to deal out. For 5326.S47 he has agreed to
build four new wharves and two ferry
Blips. . Bids for the work were opened by
the Harbor Commission yesterday and hl3
figures were accepted.
The bids were called for wharves to be
erected in the vicinity of the Lombard
street slips. It is the intention to move
the slips from the south to the north Bide
of Lombard-street pier, and In the space
left between Lombard-street pier and pier
17, which projects from the front between
Green and Union streets, to build four
covered wharves. This will do away with
the present fishermen's wharf, and the
fishermen will have to be located else
where.
Bids were called for the construction of
"car ferry slips 1 and 2; pier 19, Union
street wharf; pier 21, Filbert-street
wharf; pier 23, Greenwich-street wharf
No. 1; pier 25, Greenwich-street wharf No.
2." Individually, and a separate bid for
the whole work, was also required.
The bids and bidding were as follows:
R. H. Wakefleldâ Slips, $72,895; pier 19, $61,
7S9; pier 21, J64.SS3; pier 23. J83.S75; pier 25,
J63.1S5. Bid for all five works, $326, Â£47.
L. H. Flersonâ Slips, $105,000; pier 19, $85,000:
pier 21, $55,000; pier 25, $90,000; pier 25, $S0,000.
Bid for all five works. $450,000.
City Street Improvement Companyâ Blips,
$78,484; pier 19, $67,837; pier 21, $69,813; pier 23,
169,445; pier 25, $69,445. Bid for all live works,
$353,000.
James A. McMahonâ Slips, $89,600. No other
bids. Â¦
Dundon Bridge Companyâ Slips, $S4,7S3; pier
18, J67.400; pier 21. $74,477; pier 23, $73,737; pier
25, $72,SS3. Bid for all five works, $373,290.
. It was seen that In both the individual
and the collective bids Wakefleld was by
far the lowest, and so on motion of Com
missioner lierold he - was awarded the
contract. It is a long contract, but Mr.
Wakefield Fays he is going to put tne
work through as rapidly as possible. He
believes it will take him three or four
months at least to complete each wharf.
Wakefleld has bid on the contract in his
own behalf, and he is not certain which
one of the firms in which he has interests
will take charge of the work. He is a
member of Wakefleld & Jacobs, that has
been doing the jetty work at Coos Bay;
also of Smith, Wakefield & David, doing
the reservoir work at Seattle, and also of
Wakefleld & Bridges, general contractors
of Portland, Or. It is his belief now that
the firm of Wakefield & Bridges will take
up the contract he has Just secured. Most
of the material, he says, will be brought
here from the Columbia River and hla
own people will handle all of it.
The fishermen will be moved to a place
now being built for them between the end
of the extension of the seawall and Black
Point. A breakwater is being built, and
in the lee of the bluffs of the point the
boats can He as snugly as at any place
along the front.
CONTRACTOR FROM OREGON GETS
A PRIZE PLUM FROM HARBOR BOARD
Authority wbs given to J. Ross Clark
and T. E. Gibbon to determine between
the two surveys already made between
Los Angeles and Riverside and- to let a
contract for the construction of the road.
While Perry S. Heath has been named as a
director, his connection with the road may
extend much further than his duties as a
director. Overtures Have been made to
him to take an active part in the con
struction and operation of the road.
It was decided to build a road at once
from Los Angeles to Riverside, a distance
of about fifty miles, the construction of
which will cost, approximately, with roll
ing stock, $2,000,000. It was also ivoted to
purchase additional locomotives, passen
per and freight cars for the Loa Angeles
Terminal road, now in operation.
The Empire Construction Company was
organized with a paid up capital of $1,000,
000. This corporation will undertake the
entire construction of the new road and
will be paid in bonds of the railroad com
pany. The president of the construction
company Is J. Ross Clark, with T. E. Gib
bon as vice president. A development
company was also organized with Thomas
Kerens as president; Perry S. Heath,
vice president, and R. C. Kerens Jr. as
secretary. The development company
will have a capital of $5,000,000 and will
control all the town Bites, real estate and
coal and mineral lands along, the line of
the road, Including the property of the
Los Angeles Terminal Road.
The road, when completed, will have a
trackage of 1100 miles and will absorb the
Los Angeles Terminal Railroad, fifty-one
miles in length, with 'all its property and
franchises, including between 3CO0 and 4009
acres of land and embracing all the
wharfage of the San Pedro harbor, about
two miles in length. The Los Angeles
Terminal Road, in which Senator Clark
now has a large Interest, will be taken
over by the new company at a valuation
of $5.W0.O00.
The incorporators of the road were all
named directors, in addition to whom
David Keith. C. O. Whittemore, S. A.
Bemls. A. H. Hanlin and "W. B. Clark
were also selected. The directors named
the following officers: President, "W. A.
Clark; first vice president. R. C. Kerens;
second vice president. J. Ross Clark; third
vice president, T. E. Gibbon; secretary,
T. F. Miller; treasurer, F. K. Rule.
The capital stock of the company is
placed at $25,000,000, of which $6,000,000 has
already been paid up. The directors of
the company are: W. A. Clark, Montana;
C. W. Clark, Montana; R. C. Kerens, Mis
souri; E. W. Clark, Missouri; G. B. Leigh
ton, Missouri; J. Ross Clark, California;
T. F. Miller. California; Perry S. Heath,
"Washington; Thomas Kerens. Utah; W.
S. McCormick, Utah, and Reed Srnoot",
Utah.
SALT LAKE. Utah. Nov. 22.â The talk
which has been current for the past three
months regarding a direct railroad con
nection between this city and Los Angeles
took final 6hape to-day in the agreement
for corporation of the Los. Angeles and
Salt Lake Railroad Company, and the
enterprise now seems assured.
Senator W. A. Clark and (associates who
are interested in the enterp^se met here
yesterday and went Into a conference
which lasted, until 2 o'clock this Â¦ morn
ing. The articles' of Incorporation, which
had been drawn up by Attorneys Blbbon
and Whittemore, were discussed and ap
proved. The articles will be filed with the
Secretary of State to-morrow.
Incorporators of the New Enterprise
Are AllsNamed as Directors and
Senator Clark is Chosen
President
Line From Los Angeles to
Salt Lake Will Rapidly
Be Built.
CLARK'S RAILROAD
IS INCORPORATED
"It is my opinion that $S0 an acre Would
be a fair sum to pay for the entire prop
erty, and I say that if the State Lesi^in
ture Is Induced to authorize a pureha**?
the entire transaction should be com
pleted at one time. Let us nave it all cr
nothing. The forest conrains, without
doubt, the finest specimens of redwood in
the country. Should the State decfd* It
make a public reservation ot the land the
Southern Pacific Company would unciues
tionably extend the narrow-gauge railway
Into the district. The distance would V*Â»
about nine miles and the extension would
r.ot cost more than $75,000."
The owners of the land h*ve askeu *10>
Ptr acre, which the party was lnct-n^tl 10
think a bit exorbitant. Mr. MU13. tin *l'a
cussing the question yesterday." sai-J:*
"There are two sections or land which
have been offered for sale. One cover.*
about 160t> acres and the other about 7lo.
but between these two pieces there is a
apace of two and a half miles. Now if
we combine ownerships arid secure; the
entire tract, covering some 13.0W acres.
1 wouid approve of the pUicnas<*. but I
do not believe it would i>e advUiMk !<>
buy either one or both ot the â¢ plcc-s
offered with the two-and-a-half-mils gay
between. It would destroy the beauty -,i
the reservation, and while this khp is -not
heavily Â¦ timbered it would iiftord protec
tion to the creeks and main forest. Then
again It wouldn't be wise to have thÂ»Â» Â»tr*a.
around the forest disturbed or subjctnl
to the ravages of fire. If Â«iÂ»e State pur
chased the entire 13,000 acres it would
always be " desirable property. rvh-Â»h--r
used as a reservation or not. and would
enhance at a rate that would more thar.
be equal to the interest on the money ;r.
vested.
The party arrived at Bou!i!er Creek en
Monday and returned to this city Wednes
day evening. The object of the tn;> v.<Â»s
to explore the redwood belt in the 15:g
Bat<ln with a view toward Â«Â«elt!n^ some
fair price upon the property, mhich- it is
desired to have the ritate purchas*: for u
public park, thereby .-*avins the bea\Â»tii"ui
forest irom the ax of ihe woodman. Ar:
option on the lands tiesirtd ha> bee-.' or -
tained up to December i. when 5C*i.tÂ«Â»
must either be deposited as part payment
or a proper guarantee lor the earns must
be given.
The Bis Basin at Santa Cruz is again
attracting the attention of prominent San
Francisco men who want to see the prop
erty converted into a State reservation.
A party of local capitalists, railroad ar.rt
professional men has just returned from
an inspecting tour of the basin. ' Amons

mulation of a large number of claims in the
hands of one individual.
(a) A law making the location and segrega
tion of a mining claim a personal act and
abolishing the power of attorney.
2. The establishment of an effective mail
service between the States and the Northern
part of Alaska.
3. The chancre or amendment of the mining
laws of the District of Alaska, as follows:.
Resolved, That, therefore, a committee of
three be elected and chosen by the people of
Nome in mass meeting assembled and requested
to proceed at once to Washington and there
to urge upon Congress the passage and en
actment of the following laws:
1. A change In the law of Incorporation for
municipalities within the district whereby one
half of the license money now devoted to school
purposes may be turned into the general fund
of the municipality.
Whereas, Owing to the remoteness of this
section of Alaska from the centers of civiliza
tion, peculiar conditions prevail whereby the
laws applicable to Southeastern Alaska and
the State of Oregon do not furnish the neces
sary means for the development of our re
sources. ;
When questioned concerning receivers in
general and McKenzle in particular, the
captain became quite emphatic.
"This >IcKenzie business." he said, "is
the greatest piece of wholesale rascality
the world has known since the Panama
Canal scandal. It is nothing more nor less
than an attempt on the part of an organ
ized band of smooth freebooters to ac
quire every valuable claim in the country
through a corrupt interpretation of the
mining laws that govern them. The very
possibility of there being any two sides
to the controversy is laughable to any one
acquainted with the matter. The manip
ulations of McKenzle and his parasites
have already cost the people of Nome and
the merchants on this coast doing busi
ness with them hundreds of thousands of
dollars, and unless they are legally stop
ped this winter Nome will see some ex
citing and disastrous times in the future.
"The best way to understand the work
upon which the committee is sent is by
reading the resolutions which were adopt
ed by the meeting at which the committee
was appointed, and to which 'the commit
tee stands solemnly pledged."
The resolutions of which the captain
spoke are as follows:
Territory are the power of attorney,
claim jumping and the appointment of re
ceivers. It la against these we will prin
cipally work."

By giving Judgment in favor of the de
fendants in the case of Laura Le Tour
neux against George P. Gillis and E. Wil
son, brought to recover J635, including
principal and Interest, on a promissory
note executed by the defendants in favor
of Thomas Eager and assigned to the
plaintiff, Judge Belcher has again decided
tliat "lobbying" is contrary to public
policy.
In an answer filed to the complaint of
Laura Le Tourneux, Mr. Wilson stated
that he indorsed the note for Gillis that
he might obtain money from Eager "with
which to lobby certain bills of interest to
Gillis and others by whom he was secretly
employed which came up for- the. consid
eration of the Legislature of 1S37." It was
further alleged that the plaintiff did not
pay for the nnte,- but the same was as
eigned tocher in other than good faith.
Judge Belcher decided that the conten
tions of the defendant were correct. "Th' 1 }
note." said the court, "was gjven for the
purpose of procuring the expenses of lob
bying, and in the hands of the holder
there can be no" recovery because the con
tract which" caused its execution was
against public j policy, and Eager's in

note Jn good faith for a valuable consid

Obedience to Franchise.
The alleged act of the Presidio and Fer

and appurtenances has led to the filing' of
a suit by Ann F. Reynolds against the
corporation for damages and . a decreed
adjudging the tracks a nuisance.
The plaintiff alleges that the prox

walk in front of her property, situated on
the south side of Union street, near Hyde
has damaged her in the sum of $7800.
Mrs. Reynolds avers that the company,
in violation of its franchise, has intruded
upon the south half of the street and laid
Its tracks within four feet two Inches of
the sidewalk and eight feet southerly o/
the line proposed in ita franchise. The
maintenance of the track, Mrs. Reynolds
alleges, obstructs the use of her sidewalk
and endangers the life and limbs of her
self, family and tenants, and has depre
ciated the value of her property in the
sum stated. .
Mrs. Reynolds asks that the company
be forced to tear up the tracks and move
them to the center line of the street, or
that It be forced to suspend operations.

The good citizens of San Francisco will
rejoice if the Assemblymen representing
other counties shall unite and resolve to
exclude from consideration every member
of Boss Kelly's bunch.
The Call does not attach any signifi
cance to Kelly's statement that a Sena
torial combine has been formed. So far
as can be ascertained there Is only one
member of the San Francisco Senatorial
delegation that would consent to an alli
ance with Kelly and Crimmins. The story
of a. Senate scheme was told to several
Assemblymen in order to induce them to
get in and pull the boss chestnuts out of
the fire.
Boss Kelly has no patronage to be
stow. He has nothing In sight to deliver.
If the .interior members could be hood
winked as easily as Kelly would have
the city members fancy the boss might
be able to reach out and' get a few clerk
ships and a committee chairmanship or
two by the use of a solid San Francisco
delegation, but as the scheme is now ex
posed the forty-six Republican AsBembly

buke the boss. If a San Francisco mem

tion.
Promises of Patronage and Chairmanships to Induce
Legislators From This City to Combine.
Martin Kelly is using the old-fashioned
boss methods to trap unsuspecting mem
bers of the San Francisco delegation In
the Assembly. He is telling them that if
they will stand in on a combine and fol
low his leadership he will secure the bulk
of the patronage for them and guarantee
that every member of the combine shall
have a committee chairmanship, no mat
ter how the coctest for the Speakershiy
terminates. The boss is anxious that the
members of the delegation shall give him
capital to put into the business at Sacra
mento. He cannot command the support
of more than four or live members of
the Assembly, hence he is resorting to the
shallow device of promising something
that he cannot deliver. He tells the As
semblymen that the San Francisco Sen
ators have established a combine to con
trol the patronage of the Ccnate and that
the members of the other branch of the
Legislature will get i othing if they do
not fall in.
Kelly says to the Assemblymen that he
has no candidate for speaker, as it makes
no difference who may be chosen to pre
flflc over the Assembly. All that he de-
Flres is the authority io handle the dele
gation for the benefit ~i the combine. The
boss never went to Sacramento to do bus
iness with a smaller followirg than he

anxious for an immediate reinforcement.

! After hearing the testimony of wit

day the Coroner's jury returned the fore
going verdict. Much of the evidence on
which the verdict was based was drawn
out by Police Sergeant Duke, who as
sisted the Coroner in the examination of
witnesses.
There was some contradictory testi
mony becring upon thÂ« relations of
ThomasfBurke with the Eayrs family and
as to the appearance In shirt sleeves of
Thomas Hugh Cameron, the lodger in the
Eayrs residence. Cameron swore that
when he was awakened by Eayrs at 1
o'clock in the morning he slipped on his
shoes, trousers and coat and went down
to the sidewalk where Burke was lying.
He did not put on his shirt, he said, and
wore only his undershirt under his coat.
The Coroner called attention to the fact
that Cameron in his deposition to the po
lice had said that he put on his coat,
trousers and shirt. Cameron said that
the statement in the deposition was a
mistake.
J. Stenson of 464 Hickory avenue 8wo*re
that he heard cries of "murder!" and
"help!" and looking out of his window a
short time afterward saw Burke lying on
the sidewalk and the policeman and Eayrs
approaching him.
This testimony was supported by that
of Police Patrolman William Minehan,
who heard cries of "murder!" proceeding
from Burke. He ran into the alley and
saw Burke lying on the sidewalk. When
Minehan asked what was the matter.
Burke replied:
"I could lick one of them, but the other
fellow gave it to me."
When Cameron came downstairs in his
shirt sleeves Policeman Minehan observed
that he wore tan, laced shoes; also a vest,
white shirt, collar and necktie.
Eayrs testified that he came home at 1
a. m.. and as he turned into the alley he
heard a man shouting: "Help! help! I'm
chained here to a railroad track!" He
went Into the house and aroused Cam
eron, who identified the prostrate man as
Burke. He admitted that Burke was a
frequent visitor to the house. â¢
Mrs. Mary Eayrs, wife of the last men
tioned witness, swore that Burke had vis
ited her house only three times. Upon
those occasions he called upon Miss Josle
Foley. ' The last time he called was on
election night, November 6. Miss Foley
was not In, and Mrs. Eayrs stood at the
door in the full glare of the street lights
and talked with Burke for about an hour.
She admitted that, in company with Jo-
Eie Foley, she had met Burke and his
friend, John Nagle, one night at the
Chutes, but the meeting was accidental.
John Nagle testified that Burke had
been in Morris Levy's saloon and was un

AS'N'A COLTON. a daughter of A.
D. Colton, a well-known haber
dasher of this city, residing at
131 Second street, has disappeared
and her parents and the police
*re making every effort to find her. The
young woman left her home last Tuesday
afternoon and has net been heard of
since. Her parents are extremely anxious
about her. as she is mentally unbalanced.
During the past three months she has
been under the care of Dr. Perry, the
family physician. He was treating her
for nervousness, and knowing her desire
to wander away from home, he warned
her mother to keep a close watch upon
her. Despite the close care and attention
given Miss Colton. she slipped out of the
house and now her whereabouts is a mys
tery. It was thought the young lady had
gone to the home of her sister, Mrs. Ben
jamin Hirsch, of Sacramento, but Mrs.
Hirsch has had no tidings of her. A mes
sage was also sent to iriends of the fam
ily at Woodland, but the missing girl has
not gone near them.
Wednesday evening a brother of Miss
Colton called at the office of the Chief
of Police and asked the aid of the de
partment in locating his sister. He de
scribed her as being five feet three and
a half inche* in height, having brown H
hair and a light complexion. When she
left home Miss Colton was attired in a
tailor-made suit of black material. She
wore a white lace Jabot, green gloves

PEOPLE OF NOME.
A. MONG those who arrived here
Â» yesterday morning on the Oregon
express were Charles D. Lane,
, the Nome mining capitalist; Lafe
Pence, ex-Congressman from
Colorado and right-hand man of the "Wild
Goose Mining Company, and Captain
George B. Baldwin, delegate from North
eastern Alaska to Washington, where he
will. go In company with Dr. Rlningar, a
well-known physician of Nome, and Sam
Knight, ' the attorney of this city, the
three gentlemen having been chosen as a
committee to represent to the nation's
legislators the needs of the people of
Nome district, and put before Congress
the abuses that threaten to ruin one of
Uncle Sam's richest possessions.
Owliig to the many abuses that have
grown out of the unadaptablllty of the
laws culled from the statistics of other
States for the government of Northern
Alaska, It has been thought necessary for
the people of that section of the country
to call the attention of Congress to these
abuses with the idea or so mending the
laws that the injustices now suffered may
be done away with. For this purpose the
people of Nome, In the greatest mass
meeting ever held in Alaska," unanimously
elected those named as a committee to
represent them in Washington, empower
ing it to speak at the nation's capital as
the voice of the entire population of the
portion of the Territory It comes from.
Dr. Riningar has already gone East and
Captain Baldwin and Mr. Knight will fol

Captain Baldwin Is an old San Fran
ciscan and well known to the people of
this city. He had command of the guards
during the Midwinter Fair, was In charge
of Alcatraz Island during the war with
Spain, served with Logan during the Fili
pino trouble and was twice wounded while
carrying the bodv of that officer off the
field. From Manila he went with Ray to
Alaska, where he resigned from the army
and went into business. When seen yes

"The object of the committee of , which
I am a member Is* to see If It cannot pre
