i Continued on Second Pagre-
THE suit for libel Instituted by
Baron J. H. von Schroeder
against The Call was resumed
yesterday at San Rafael before
Tudpe Angellotti and a Jury.
The testimony which was sub
mitted during the day was presented
by the defense, and while it was
absolutely material to the determination
of the issues involved it was of such a
character as to shock those who heard
lt_ Seldom has a litigant eat in a court of
justice and heard himself characterized
by his actions as was Baron J. H. von
Kchroeder yesterday when the witnesses
of his Infamy told their stories.
He was pictured from the witness stand
es a moral degenerate, a debauchee,
a rc5'6tering drunkard, who, with bis
drunken women friends, made noisy the
hours of the night at the Hotel Rafael.
The story was not a pleasant one and
Baron J. H. von Schroeder flushed scar
!et as hÂ© heard it told. He turned and
twisted In bis chair, he counseled In agi
tation with his .lawyer, he scowled an
grily and eo lost his self-command as to
receive a sharp rebuke from bis attorney.
He cursed beneath his breath and in an
undertone.
He heard men declare under oath that
he has been a drunken debaucher of
Â¦women; that ln\he clubhouse of the Ho
tel Rafael he has drunk, Rambled, supped
and at unseemly hours raised his voice
In drunken unison of revelry with Intoxi
cated women. He heard men swear that
he has Ix-en the subject of the generosity
of his women friends; that he permitted
them to buy the wine, "which was drunk
from beer glasses, as the silence of the
night was broken by maudlin laughter
a-nd the discords which Intoxicated brains
thought were melody.

REPUTATION OF
BARON WAS BAD
Upon the second point, which is one of
the; significant 'and most Important devel
opments of the trial, the manager of The
Cafl testified that Warfleld had told .him
that men and women had declared to him
that they would not live at the Hotel
Rafael while Baron von Schroeder was
within its doors. Both oral and written
objections were made to his presence. As
bearing upon the allegation that Baron
von Schroeder injured the hotel, this de
velopment is of exceptional importance,
particularly from the fact that every ob
jection to Von Schroeder was made be
fore the article in The Call was published,
Tne very day upon which the article was
published Warfleld secured his release as
lessee.' Subsequent to' that it would have
been absurd for any one to voice an ob
jection in reference to Von Schroeder to
Warfleld, who was not in the remotest
way connected ' with- the hoteL*.' : . " â¢

deny [the truth of the publication, and
positively declined to do so and only at
the urgent solicitation of Von Schroeder's
attorney did he sign a statement assert
Ing that he did nofof his own knowledge
know th^ charg-es to be true. More than
this, Warfield declared that- the charges
published were substantially true and
â¢that his reassuring letter written to Von
Schroeder was.. dictated by policy.

The Courtâ I would prefer an objection when

A.â I certainly did not, because that is not

TO PROVE THE CHARACTER OF THE LIFE WHICH THE PLAINTIFF LED AT THE HOTEL RAFAEL.
was told, fact by fact, mrldent by Inci
dent, as midnight suppers., drunken as
signation!", clandestine excursions were
told, the attorney for Baron von Schroe
der interposed, but without purpose, his
npvrr ending objections. Now the Baron
and his friends were smashing wine
glasses In the clubhouse. Again the
j Baron's brother was leaning from a win
j flow overcome in his wild orgy by nausea.
I Still a;?a!n one of the women revelers
, was singing in mau'llin melody "He Cer
j tainly Was Good to Me."
These wore the stories which witnesses
told of the life which Baron J. H. von
Schroeder led at the Hotel Rafael and
of the environment which he created for
reputable patrons and guests of the es
\ tablishment. And the climax of moral
and social degradation was not reached
juntil a witness testified that Baron von'
Schrotder had attempted to bribe t him to
watch thf, movements .of Baroness, von
Schroeder and see that she did not sur
prise her husband m his debauchery.
Testimony such a* this has seldom been
; offered in a court of Justice. The neces
sity of any reference to it Is unfortunate.
When the interests of society demanded
that Baron von Schroeder be exposed the
1 Call was carelul not to Jeopardize the
reputations of women who had been be
i gulled by him or had so far forgotten
i themselves as to be his companions. In
this trial, therefore, the name of no
1 woman has been spoken. The proprietor
. of The Call instructed the attornes's for
! the paper that under no circumstances,
' whatever the outcome of the case might
be, was the name of a woman to be used.
The offender against eoclety is the man
who demands damages for an alleged in
' Jury to the reputation which he estab
lished for himself at the Hotel Rafael.
When the case opened yesterday testi
mony of a very vital character was intro
duced and it is significant that it was
elicited by . the attorney Â¦ for ' Baron
von Schroeder in croes-cxamination.of W.
', S. Leake the manager of the Call. Baron
von Schroeder, through his attorney, has
insisted that R. II. Warfleld; over his own
signature, declared that he had suffered;
as lessee of the Hotel Rafael, no injury
from the actions of Von Schroeder. It- is
also contended that if the hotel' gained
an unenviable notoriety,' which made it
objectionable to decent people, it did. so
afterthe publication' In. The" Call of" the
article which Von Schroeder claims te

of The Call testified '-hit fir fiL V/ar!i*M

As the shocking story of disgusting vice
Daron von Sehroeder, his brother and
their women companions were the actors,
were described. Witnesses swore that in
thrpe .orgies glasses and . dishes were
broken, that Von Schroeder and his com
panions reveled in shameless disregard of
the con?pquencÂ»Â»s ' of Â¦ their acts. . These
men. and women, the witnesses swore,
threw glasses and dishes out of the win
dows; thpy pranceO and capered about
the rooms of the clubhouse;, they sank
exhausted, overcome, senseless In their
" SHERIDAN, Or.. Dec. 18.â The three
masted schooner . Pioneer, Captain Mlch
aelson. went ashore at 4 a. m. on Monday
on the Nestucca beach. Opposite Ocean
Park. She was lumber laden from the
Knappton mills on the Columbia River
and bound -for San Francisco. When
sixty miles off shore in 45 degrees latitude
she lost her rudder and a gale blowing
ninety miles per hour forced her in shore,
where she, lies high upon the sands .with
EOO.000 feet of lumber. The captain . and
crew are safe.
There Is, however, another side to this,
according to sensational stories told by
the deserting engineer, who is imprisoned
here, and firemen who left the steamer.
They say. that the steering-gear of the
steamer was defective.- Therefore Cap
tain York may have endeavored to bring
the steamer to the proper channel, but
was unable to steer her during the gale.
Gordon, -the Imprisoned engineer; " Dona
van, a fireman, formerly of the Robert
Ada'mson, and C. E. Swanson say that
two men could not hold the wheel with
ease in fine weather. It was common for
her to go off two or more points. Gordon
in his Interview also says thatithe steam
er's steam pumps were worn out, andj
the valves being smooth the pumps could
get no suction. They were useless when
their services were required when the
steamer began to make water, which ne
cessitated her returning from Cape Flat
tery.
Gordon was charged by the master and
owners with having opened one of the
seacocks and letting water into the hull.
This he denied., but Dona van, the fireman,
said to-night that Gordon could tell more
than he would wish to of this.
SCHOONER PIONEER ASHOBE.
VICTORIA, Dec. IS.â When the steamer
Alpha left here on Saturday her master
refused to take a pilot, saying that he did
not need one, although as a matter of
fact Ca jftaln York had not been over the
route more than twice prior to his last
fatal voyage. That he did not know the
waters is shown by. the fact that he tried
to bring the Alpha into Balnes Sound
from the wrong, side of Yellow Island.
Just as the vessel sank from sight two
engineers plunged from her side, but were
sucked down as the water rolled In from
either side where the vesel had been.
William Enos and J. A. Craig, two
young Englishmen, were the only passen
gers aboard, with the exception of the
Japanese who were engaged to look after
the fish. They were among the last to
leave the vessel, and two of the swinging
lines that connected the Alpha with the
rocky shore had already parted when
Enos attempted to pull himself across
hand over hand on the last remaining
rope.' He got through safely. Craig was
In the center with a flood of water smoth
ering him when the steamer plunged
backward and the rope snapped. Craig
managed to hang on and a half minute
later was pulled in, more dead than alive.
He was the last man saved.
Young says that Captain York and Bar
ber were on the bridge when the Alpha
attempted to enter the Union Bay chan
nel and failed. An ettort was made to
swing the vessel around, but so great
was the force of wind -irr! waves against
her sides that she ref- to answer her
helm and went steadily toward the rocks.
Then the engine- bells rang to reverse at
full speed. The machinery, of ancient de
sign and always slow to work, could not
be handled and the steamer's own speed
drove her to destruction.
VANCOUVER. Dec. 18.-News to-day
from Union Bay, the scene of the disaster
to the steamer Alpha, shows the wreck
of ..the famous British steamer to have
been complete. Three bodies have been
recovered of the ninÂ«> men who were
drowned. They are those of Samuel Bar
ber, part owner, his brother. James Bar
ber, and Seaman Sullivan. Captain Gos.se
of the steamer Coquitlan, which arrived
this afternoon from Yellow Island Light
house, where the Alpha foundered, says
the hulk has nearly gone to pieces. The
vessel's back was broken In three places
and parts of her deckhouse, together with
portions of the cargo, are strewn along
the rocky coast for three miles.
Fireman Joseph Young told a thrilling
tale of the disaster to-day. After the
first smash on the ledge of rock under the
Yellow Island lighthouse he was in the
stokehole and tried to clamber out. as he
felt the vessel lurching under his feet.
He had on a lacket, shirt, overalls, boots
and hose. As he climbed out he was
swept away from the fireroom door by
the suction of a wavev Then he was car
ried against the rock3, where his feet
caught in a Jagged crevice and he left
both boots. His feÂ«?t were horribly
mangled as he Jerked himself free from
the course of the next wave. He was
burled repeatedly against floating wreck
age, and his lefs, acting, a^ ..fenders .were
frightfully lacerated before he finally was
able to obtain a footing. All his clothes
were torn off except a remnant of v his
shirt. Above the roaring of the storm "he
could hear men shouting and crying for
help and several were in the rigging as
the vessel went down.

Mr. Harmon, of counsel for appellant In
the Philippines case, followed Mr. Per
kins, speaking at times In impassioned
tones which rang throughout the cham
ber. He spoke of the august character of
the court, and of the sentiment that on
this "holy ground" justice and right were
certain to prevail. The proposition now
presented, small In Itself, involved re
sults affecting the entire future of the
Government. Mr. Harmon briefly recited
the circumstances of the Philippine case;
Emll J. Pepke, a volunteer serving
in the Philippines, purchased fourteen
diamond rings valued at $300 to $1000,
brought them back to the United States,
where, at Chicago, the United States cuÂ»-
Philippines Case Presented.
Continuing his argument Mr. Perkins
cited many other authorities supporting
his view that the constitution in ltÂ»eif
extended to territories.''
Mr! Perkins said the limitations of his
answer were intended to cover such spe
cial circumstances, relating to Indiana
and uncivilized persons, which had been
referred to. ,
Justice White suggested that in this an
swer "under the Jurisdiction of the United
States" stated out of the ouestlon the
very contention which was being made in
these cases.
Mr. Perkins answered that undoubtedly
persons born In the territory after the
cession and subject to the Jurisdiction of
the United States were citizens of the
United States.
White Asks About Indians.
Justice White asked what authority
there was for excluding Indians. He
pointed out that the distinction between
the American Indian and the citizen ante
dated the constitution. He again pro
pounded the query as to citizenship fol
lowing immediately upon session of terri
tory.
.Mr. Perkins answered in the affirmative,
saying that if his contention was correct
those bdrn in the territory after the ces
sion were citizens if they were civilized
and not in the position of our Indiana.
At this point Justice White asked a
series of pointed questions of Mr. Perkins.
The Justice first asked If Mr. Perkins*
contention would lead him to the con
clusion that immediately on the making:
of a treaty ceding territory to the United
States every person born in that territory
after the date of cession became Ipso jure
a citizen of the United States.
After examining numerous cases, Mr.
Pei kins said that the doctrine that the
constitution did not extend to the terri
tories was based on the idea that the con
stitution was a substance, a sort of
chattel, which could be moved about here
and there as Congress saw fit, rather than
fomething bequeathed to us by our ances
tors. It was, he said, a sort of "transsub
stantiation of the constitution." It was
a contention that the constitution could
not get into a territory unless Congress
placed it there. He denied that the con
stitution In itself extended to the terri
tories by declaring that it was an inani
mate substance, lacking the powers of lo
comotion. .
Sort of Transsubstantiation.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â Argument In
the Porto Rlco-Phillpplnea cases, involv
ing the status cf those countries to the
United States, was resumed In the Su
preme Court to-day. The widespread in
tcrcst in the cases was shown by the
large attendance of prominent members
of the bar and by a crowd of spectators
which filled the public area and over
flowed in the corridor. Senators and Rep
resentatives in Congress dropped in as
the arguments proceeded and gave atten
tive ear to the proceedings.
Prior to the opening of the court the
counsel conferred and arranged a general
plan of procedure by which Edward C.
Perkins, senior counsel in the Porto Ri
can case, would conclude his argument
to-day, being followed by Lawrence Har
mon, counsel in the Philippine case. The
appellants would then give way to Attor
ney General Griggs for the presentation
of the case in behalf of the Government.
This, It was expected, would continue
until to-morrow, when Charles H. Al
drich, former Solicitor General and se
nior counsel in the Philippines case, will
close In behalf of the appellants.
Mr. Perkins, in resuming his argument,
took up the Dred Scott and other cases
relating to the extension of the constitu
tion over territory. Soon after Mr. Per
kins began Justice Brown interposed an
inquiry as to whether Mr. Perkins had
examined the most recent cases relating
to the extension of the constitution to ter
ritories, and also whether he had exam
ined those sections of the United States
statutes wherein Congress extended the
constitution to certain territories. Mr.
Perkins said he had examined both of
these branches, and he hoped to be able
to present answers to the contentions
made as to them.

The Courtâ Not on that question. Judge, In
mitigation of damages.
Mr Maguire â I think so: a statement of his
belief, or a statement cf what occurred may
be given and the Jury" a Judgment may be all
right, but a statement of what hÂ« believed
The Courtâ A statement that he believed It
is not necessarily binding on the Jury. It is
for the Jury to determine as to the weight of
his testimony, but they have- a right to do it.
Mr Maguireâ We object to It as Immaterial,
irrelevant and incompetent.
The Courtâ Tbe objection is overruled. What
is the question?
(Question read by. the reporter.)
Mr Maguireâ Now. we desire to make the
additional objection there that the belief or
luactnent or conclusion of the witness at that
time was immaterial, because It appears that
he was not representing the defendant ut
that time, but that the defendant waa person
ally present. We desire to add that ground
to the tn-ounds already stated.

nasty charges made against him by his
wife In letters written from time to time.
Mrs. Smith read her own letters, and sto
ically waded through those portions that,
from their vulgar nature, caused the
court displeasure. - Ail day Judge Daln
sjerfield listened to the monotonous chant
of tbeae letters. Among the gentle (state

contained In these letters are several that
would be "fierce" in the ordinary divorce
action. Some cf these milder quotations

There are some points of pleading-, and
practice that Mrs. Josephine Smith, who,
la propria persona, is conducting her de
fente to her husband's action for divorce,
is unable to mentally assimilate. When
Bhe is confronted with these tangled
knot* it Is difficult for her to conceal her
pique. On one occasion yesterday she
ssked the court to defer the reading of
one letter written by her to her husband
until she could consult with her former
attorney. Eamuel M. Shortridge, and be
advised as to its admlsEibllity. Judge
Dalngerfield expressed his regard for Mr.

hardly beileved that it would alter the

were admissible, and It was ordered read.

ing it after you read this letter In the Bulle
tinâthe purported letter In the Bulletin?
Mr. Preston â Objected to on the ground that It

The Ccurtâ To rebut that testimony, that is
the idea.
Mr. Maguireâ That ia the idea. I admit that
we could not effer it In the first Instance.
Mr. Preston-rWe object to it on the ground
that it Is incempetect.
The Courtâ If It Is shown, and I suggested
it to you yesterday, that ihere waÂ» nothing

The j-roof has not been offered.
Mr. Prestonâ We object to that aa Incom
petent upon the ground -that it is a failure to
retract and is not competent evidence to estab

The Court (after argument)â I thini
where the defense has offered evidence of the
conduct cf a party, the other side on croes

WINE WAS FOR
HER BOY ALEX
Quiet Little Partu of Four
That Had Use for But
Two Chairs. 1
"William 8. Ballard, a barkeeper who
worked at the Hotel Rafael for a month
in 1897 and through the summer of 1893
as manager of the clubhouse, was called
to the stand. He had often seen the
Baron at the clubhouse late at night with
ladles.
"What conduct did you observer* -was
asked by defendant's counsel.
"There were o?ten wine parties, four be
ing presentâ the Baron, his brother and
two ladles, one of them married, the other
single." - .
"Did they pair off? Did the Baron have
an especial companion?" ,,
"I never saw them separate but once.
"Was there much noise?" â¢>.-â¢=
"Not except singing."
"Any dishes broken?"
"Oh. yes, dishes were brokenâ thrown
out of the window. Lots of glasses were
broken. The Baron paid for them."
. "What did they drink?"
% "Usually four bottles of wine."
"Who paid for It?"
"Generally the Baron. The married
woman sometimes paid for it."
"What did they drink out of?"
"Generally beer glasses."
"Do you remember any particular occa
sion?"
"Once late in July I was ordered to
serve a bottle of wine. Soon the bell rang
again, and as I *-ent into the wineroom
the unmarried woman had the bottle of
wine and she said, 'No, this Is for my boy.
Alex, and me.' and the other lady ordered
another quart of wine for herself and the
Baron." .
"How were they sitting?"
"In two chairs, the women on the men's
laps."
"The married woman on the Baron's
lap?"
''She was."
"Was her husband In the hotel at the
time?"
"He was a guest, but I think was away
at the time."
"Did you ever have any conversation
.with the Baron -about his wife?*'
\ Objection was made and overruled.
'> "One night the Baron and these three
came Into the clubhouse. The Baron said
to me, 'Has the Baroness been over here
this evening?' I said she had been, but
had gone back. He said, 'Will you do me
a favor?' I said yes. and he put a five
dollar note into my hand and said for me
to tell him if the Baroness came back to
the clubhouse.
"Did these four remain together during
these evenings, or did they separate?
Wcs the wine always drunk in the card
room?"
"Sometimes In the grounds, and some
times in. the Â¦ cardrooms." .
"Did von Schroeder ever ask you as to
where the others were?"
"He did.'-'
"What others did he ask about?"
"The Baron Alexis and the woman with
him." , '
"Where' were they at the time?"
Magufre objected and the objection was
sustained. ' . â¢-
."Had you Been' the brother leave the
presence of the Baron?"
Plaintiffs counsel kept interposing ob
jectlons 1 to the line of questioning. Pres
ton contendlng.that it was permissible on
the ground that objectionable conduct on
the part of the brother Alexis and known
to the Baron made the latter culpable. To
a. slightly different question the witness
answered: Â¦ ;
"I told the Baron that Alexis had left,
taking with him a bottle of wine and two
glasses." i ..-.-. :
"What did the Baron do?"
"He ordered a pint of wine and took It
into a cardroom." â¢â¢ ' \ ' '
"Who was there?" : -
"I understand I am not to mention
names, of .women.".-
"That la right. Under no circumstances
are you to do that In your testimony.
Was a woman-, there?"
"A married woman."
Â» "What did you see occur there?"
"After a while I was called again by
the bell., I found the lady on the Baron's
lap, -or rather reclining against him. She
seemed " downhearted Â¦ and was crying.
He said, 'Never mind, dear, I am in the
same fix.' I served the wine and she
signed the wine card."
"Where was the Baron's right hand?"
"On- the shoulder of the lady, his arm
around her.'.'
"Where was her left hand?"
"He held it In his left."
"Her other hand free to sign the wine
card?"
"Yes."
"Did you ever have any conversation
with the Baron concerning his wife?"
Objection was made and Preston re
framed the question thus:
"Did the Baron ever give you money to
watch his wife, to see that she did not in*
terfere with his parties?"
Maguire objected and the question was
argued at much length, juage AnKelloi^i
held that the evidence was permissible as
containing an admission on the part of
plaintiff. The answer of witness was: â¢
"He did not."
"Did the Baron ever tell you to warn
him If the Baroness came over to the
clubhouse?"
"He did."
Her Favorite Coon Song.
"What was their conduct at these little
wine parties in regard to singing?"
"Well, they used to sing a great deal,
generally coon songs."
"Do you remember any particular
song?"
"One of the ladles was fond of singing
'He Certainly Was Good To Me.' "
Plaintiff's counsel took the witness.
"Where have been employed for the last
three or four months?"
"In the Palace Hotel?"
"Have you been In the employ of Mr.
Leake?"
"I was for a few weeks, hunting up
witnesses who knew facts such as I re
iated. . .
"How did you come to go to Mr.
Leake?".
"I was talking with Harry McKensle, a
waiter, and told him of my experiences
at the Hotel Rafael in 1898. He said that
he was looking for a man with such evl- 1
dence; that I might go and see Mr. Leake
or not. but in any case I would be sub
penaed."
"Did McKenzie, say there was money in
It?" <
"No, he satd nothing of the kind."
"Mr. Peters,. how often did you see the
Baron on the grounds as late as 4 o'clock."
"I will not say that I saw him there
that late."
"How often did you see him as late as
3 o'clock?"
"Several times. I should say."
"Did the Baron join In the singing in
tho cardrooms?"
,. "He sometimes Joined in the refrain."
â¢."Did you say you ever saw the Baron
Intoxicated?" . ' * "' " '

"Was he lying on the floor?"
"No, he was sitting in his chair or
walking about."
"Was be able to talk intelligently?"
"I cannot cay that he was. He often
talked a lot of nonsense."
"What were your relations to Baron von
Schroeder while you were at the hotel?"
"He treated me as a servant and I treat

CHICAGO, Dec. 18.â Af the convocation
exercises at the University of Chicago
President Harper announced that John D.
Rockefeller had made another gift of $1,
000.000 to the institution. Of this sum Â»1.
000,000 is to be used as an endowment fund
and the university is to derive the benefit
of the Income from it from year to year.
It is also stipulated that the $1,000,000 is to
be in the university's name and it is to be
considered its absolute property > tot all
time.
The remainder of the gift is to be used
for. immediate purposes and for. general
needs. Mr. Rockefeller suggests that $100,
000 of the $500,000 be used for the construc
tion of a university press building, a large
part of the structure to be devoted to a
library. Â¦ - ;: .
Before making public Mr. Rockefeller's
latest gift r>r. Harper upheld In emphatic
term? the right â¢ of the prof essors of the
Univerelty: of Chicago to freedom of
speech.- The earnestness with which- he
declared that no donor might interfere
with the speech' of any of the Instructors
of the university, coming, as it did, just
before the. announcement of, an additional
gift? from Mr. Rockefeller, was specially
significant. He said: "Whatever. may
have happened â¢ In -â¢ other universities, in
the University .of Chicago neither the
trustees nor the president, nor any one In
official position. 1 has at any. time called an
instructor, to , account for any pu blic ut

order â¢ not - to be. misunderstood ' I wish- to
say that no donor of funds to the univer
sityâand I include in the number of don
ors the- founder; of â¢ the university, Mr.
Rockefellerâ has,, ever by a single word or

instruction given to the students of tha

Women Paid for Wine.
"W r ho used to pay for the wine?"
The question was objected to, and
Prefeton said that his purpose was to
show that the women frequently paid for
the wine, and that he sought testimony to
establish a direct allegation of defen

objection. The witness answered:
"Sometimes the Baron and sometimes
the women."
"Were either of these women married?"
"One of them."

that was asked the witness at the making of

to the extent of the ruling- of the court. It
was intended by the court at this time simply
to hold that testimony of specific acts of Im
propriety occurring .beyond the limits of the
Hotel Rafael would . not. In the Judgment of
the court,: be admissible, standing by them
selves. I hÂ«ve noticed that In the alleged 11

complaint was published, and .that alle
gations as to what took place at Pastori's
were not included either In the article or
In the answer, and hence testimony as to
conduct at that place was not admissible.
The .court, however, reserved its formal
ruling until after the noon recess.
At 1:45 o'clock, when the' court recon
vened. Judpe Angellotti said:
Not a letter was read during the day
that did not contain a charge more' or
less shocking in its nature against the

Maguire made the argument for plain
tiff and Delmas relied for defendant,
holding that testimony relative to scan
dalous conduct, of the Baron and his
friends that injured the good name of the
hotel was admissible, even if the acts re
lated occurred away from the hotel and
its Immediate vicinity. The question, was
argued at length, and at its close Judge
Angellotti said that in his Judgment such
testimony was not admissible within the
pleadings. The answer of defendant ad
mitted that the article referred to in the
Magulre objected, and the Jury -was ex
cused while argument on the point at
issue should be heard.
Frank I*. Perkins was recalled and de
fendant's counsel asked: "What did you
see at Pastori's?"
Mr. Magulreâ I don't know that that Is ma
terial at all. The fact Is that whatever the
lease was It was duly released by the proper
Turtles on the 25th Of October, 1S99. Â¦â¢

Eminent Scholars Flan an Interesting

A letter, written by.Armond, the son of
the litigantsâ a letter resplendent with
the lad'e knowledge of matters amatory,
which he said he had gained at lectures
plvFn from time to time to the class of
youngsters- of which â¢ he was a member,
was also read on behalf of the plaintiff.
It is alleged by Mr. Smith that this letter
was prompted if not dictated by Mrs.
Smith. - A- few of Â¦ the off erings of advice
from the son to the father, omitting those
Â¦- "We 'contend that the word 1Â» mur

plaintiff has been charged with murder
by his wife." and into the record it went,
that, together- with nearly; all the other
crimes known to man. Smith had been
charged by his wife with murder. t
you. â¢ â¢ â¢ I venture to say that in San
Francisco no sane man of your age would
dress in such a suit as you appeared In
last Sabbath. 1 suppose you shaved your
face In order to have it correspond with
your boyish set-up. â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ "iou must
procure a divorce trom me. your wife,
and on the proper grounds, or else i
charge you at once to foreake four pres
ent companions In vice, or I. yflur lawful
wife, will hold you responsible personally
for the degrading insult offered to me
and our son and to the sacred relation
ship I bear to you."
Smith, in response to the question of his
attcrney. Foshay Walker, said that he
deduced from the statement "will hold
vou responsible personally," that his wife
intended to do him violence.
Other extracts from the letters read:
"If you, my husband, were not already a
thief, the meanest kind of a thief. â¢ â¢ â¢
The race track and the Maison Tortoni
are your haunts, and at both places you
squander the money o.f the railroad com
pany. â¢ â¢ â¢ Your ur.cle. N." T. Smith,
thought that after I was compelled to
separate from you that I. would turn to
him with admiring eyes, but I never
looked upon him an anything more than
my husband's uncle. â¢ â¢ â¢ Thank God.

hands on that old scoundrel there would
not be much left cf him. â¢ â¢ â¢ If you
do not prove the truth of your charges
spainst me I will kill you. â¢ â¢ â¢ I will
yield up my life for my. good name.
â¢ â¢ â¢ I am flKhtinR you. not the world."
"I will tell C. P. Huntlngton you are a
thief." she wrote In one letter, "and I
will prove It. If you bother me any more
I will tell all about the Cliff Housed â "
"Murder Is the last word, the Cliff
Hou.Â«e murder." atfded Attorney Walker.
- "No,- he hasn't as -yet committed a mur
der." responded Mrs. Smith, tartly. >.
The letter was handed to Judge Dain
gerfield. "It looks like murder. I guess
it is murder." said the court.
"Well, there was no murder, pleaded
Mrs. Smith. "There was no murder. Let
it bo out."

ALL RIGHT IN BISCUITS
But a Poor Medicine.
Common soda Is all right In Its place
and indispensible In the kitchen and for
cooking and washing purposes, but soda
was never intended for medicine, and peo-
ple who use It as such will some day
regret It.
The common use of soda to relieve heart-
burn and sour stomach Is a habit which
thousands of people practice almost dally,
and one which is fraught with danger.
Soda gives only temporary relief, and In
the end the stomach trouble gets worse
and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical Irritant
to the walls of the stomach I and bowels,
and cases are on record where It accumu-
lates In the Intestines, causing death by
Inflammation or peritonitis.
Dr. Uarlandson recommends as the
safest and surest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia) the daily use after meals
of an excellent preparation, sold by
druggists under the name of Stuarts
Dyspepsia Tablets. These tablets are
largre 20-srrain lozenges, pleasant to the
taste and containing natural peptones
and di^eatlve elements necessary to {rood
digestion, and which all weak stomachs
lack.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets used regu-
larly after meals digest the food prompt-
ly and thoroughly before it has time to
ferment, sour and poison the blood and
nervous system. na
Dr. Wuerth state- that he Invariably
uses and recommends Stuart's Dy*ix ? ~>aii
Tablets In all forms of stomach derSSS
ment, and finds them a certain curenot
only for Â«our stomach, but by causin*

generally acknowledged to be the m^
reliable cure for any stomach trouble!

PEtXLUMA, Dec. 18.â The big estate
left by the late William Pettis Hinshaw,
the Sonoma County capitalist: and ranch
er, seems destined to become involved In
litigation. Mr. Hinshaw left no will' ana'
the courts were making preparations â¢ to
distribute the estate to his heirs In the
usual ratio, in accord with â¢ nearness : - of
kin; Now a brother of the deceased, ex-
Senator E. C. Hinshaw, comes forward
with a demand for a - different distribu
tion, advancing- rather novel grounds. - .
When "W. P. , Hinshaw ; was married, it
is claimed, he was possessed of $20,000 In
money and had landed property, and this
sum formed the nucleus of . his : vast es

Mr. Davis took an affidavit as to her
registration under the assumed name and
then returned to Geyservtile, broken
hearted over his discovery. He will at

be alleged in his complaint that Mrs.
Davis is new living with R Y. Forbes,
the man whose name she assumed: that
Fhe -was nr-ver the wife of Forbes, but
that the latter is the father of her only
child.
Mrs. Davis continued In the restaurant
business until June of this year. Then
the constable disposed of his meat mar
ket and. with his wife, established a large
4>oardinff-house. They prospered through
the summer months and tranquillity
marked their domestic relations. When
the summer's rush was over Mrs. Davis
expressed a wish to visit her parents and
other relatives in King City. Her hus
band provided her with transportation,
supplied all the other requisites for the
proposed trip and gave her $150 for spend
ing money. He accompanied her to the
railway station, where, at parting, the
wife gave every evidence of her devotion.
On h*r arrival in San Francisco that
evening 1 she wrote to him a letter telling
-r.f tier bbÂ£b Journey, eloping with the
words: "God bless you. dear. 1 shall
always say that in my prayers."
Several weeks rolled by. and. having
received no further word from his wife.
Constable Davis wrote to her parents and
other relatives, and was informed by
them that she had not visited them. Then
began his search for the missing woman.
In which he vras assisted by other pÂ»Â»ace
officers of this vicinity. He went to King
City, and there he was Joined by Con
stable Philips. The two proceeded to
San Luis Ob'.ppo. where they found that
Urs. .Davis had registered at the Com
mercial Hotel as Mrs. R. Y. Forbes.
Mrs. l^oraine lianiber came to t;<?3-*er
vilie in June, 1SSÂ». and bought a restau
rant. She had one child, a pretty little
daughter. Several weeks later J. C.
Bamber appeared upon the scene, de
clared the woman im his wife and pro
ceeded to make himself at home at her
place of business. Soon stories were cir
culated of cruelty and abuse on the part
of the husband. From the time of her
arrival in Geyscrville Mrs. Bamber had
made friends, and when It became known
that she Â«raa being maltreated by her
husband the citizens took a hand and
caused his arrest. Womanlike. Mrs.
Bambcr allowed her sympathy to triumph
and refused to appear against htm. He
was piven his freedom, and simultaneous
ly warning was served upon him that he
leave CJeyserville Jiever to return, unless
he desired a coat of tar and feathers.
Bamber lost no time In retting away,
taking 1 with him what money his wife
happt-ned to have on hand.
Constable Davis was a boarder at Mrs.
Bamber's restaurant and was one of the
foremost in gaining for the woman pro
tection against her husband. At first he
was moved only by pity, but, as the two
grew to know each other better this
pity riponed into alTectlon. The constable
gave the proprietress of the restaurant
financial assistance and gradually the
place acquired a lucrative business. Mrs.
Bamber having obtained a divorce from
her husband, she and the constable were
married in October, XSO*J, Rev. 13. F. Bon

sacrifice Davis made in taking this step
was not known until after his return
yesterday from his fruitless quest for his

previous life, as she had told It to him,
became public.

visit with relatives at King City. As a
result of his inquiries he will at once file
& suit for divorce, alleging desertion.
Back of this story of a wite'm infidelity
there is a romance containing elements of
pathosâ the love of a strong man, awak
ened by pity for a woman in misfortune,
only to be shattered by base ingratitude.

"what I have already saidâ that this bill
Is for the best Interests of the country,
and I believe that It is going to pass the
Senate. I know the stories they are tell
ing 'about what the opposition to the bill
profess to be able to do. I have said
from the first that this bill must go
through Congress In a perfectly clean
way and absolutely upon Its merits. And
that Is the way It is going through If at
all. I will stake my reputation as a busi
ness man of a good many years' experi
ence and as a shipper on the prediction
that this bill will do what we claim for
it. and that it will result in 50 per cent
of our trade being carried under the
American flag. This will , be of Incalcul
able benefit to the United States. It will
give an Impetus to shipbuilding, an ' Im

WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 18.â In spite
>of- the tremendous, attack, being made
upon the shipping bill, disregarding the
claims made by agents of foreign steam
ship lines and owners of foreign built
'ships, and brushing aside as ' unimportant
the widely advertised opposition of Sen
ators who are engaged In the policy of
obstruction. Senator Hanna said emphati
cally to-night that the ship subsidy bill
would pass the Senate.
The Ohio Senator made this assertion
at the close of a day unusually full of
rumors at to what this Senator would
do and what that Senator had done. It
was reported that Senator McMillan of
Michigan intended to offer three or four
amendments to the bill, - and would be
aided In pressing his amendments by such
powerful men as Senators Spooner, Alll
son and Hale. :
Senator McMillan's amendments were
understood to provide for. the reduction
of the number of years the bounty is to
run, for a large reduction of the amount
of the subsidy to be paid, and for the
striking out of the discriminating rates
of bounty to be paid In favor of speed and
of the gross capacity of cargo, which is
now largely occupied by passenger room
and mail bags in fast American liners.
..Another amendment, which will un
doubtedly be offered, is to limit the total
bounty that can be paid foreign-built
ships that come. under an agreement of
owner* to build compensating amount of
tonnage In American yards. This last
amendment, it Is said, will be presented
to answer the argument that. the Ameri
can line Is getting too large a proportion
of bounty to be paid to foreign, ships. 1
Â¦â¢: Senator Hanna declined to discuss any
of these rumors about amendments being
Mr. Grlggs' argument was not concluded
when, at 4:30 p. m., the court adjourned
until to-morrow. Mr. Griggs will conclude
to-morrow, and Mr. Aldrich will close the
cases for the plaintiffs.
As the Attorney-General proceeded, he
warmed up to his subject, at times speak
ing with great emphasis and pounding
home his points by resounding blows on
the table before him. Secretary Gage
came In during the latter part of the day.
justice Brewer Inquired of the Attorney
General soon after he had begun If he
maintained that Arizona and New Mexi
co came Into the same category with the
new possessions and the limitations could
be placed upon them. Mr. Griggs said he
would later consider how far the terri
tories In thlp country and those beyond
the sea rested on the sameibasis. -
Taking up the constitutional question,
the Attorney General declared that there
was no doubt that it was the Intention
of the Paris treaty not to make the ceded
islands a part of *.he United States, and
also that It was intended not to make the
inhabitants of those islands citizens.
The Attorney General contended that
the United States has the power to ac
quire territory; that having acquired It,
It has the right to govern It; that admin
istrative construction. Congressional ac
tion and Judicial precedent affirm that
every port In a ceded country Is properly
regarded ad foreign until laws are ex
tended by Congress to the new posses
sions; that the clause of the constitution
of the United States declaring duties uni
form throughout the United States is n'ot
applicable to new possessions, and that
the constitution does not extend of Its
own force over acquired territory.
Referring to the legal aspect of the case
he asserted that the Dlngley act applied
to merchandise Imported from Porto Rico
and the Philippines after their cession
to the United States, the Eame as It did
before, and that In view of the fact that
the tariff laws are in rem there Is no
principle of Justice, much less of con
stitutional restriction, which forbids Con
gress from taxing 1 In this way the mer
chandise of outlying possessions of the
United States when brought Into the
ports of the Union.
Attorney General Griggs followed, pre
senting the Government's position In the
case. He began in quiet and conversa
tional style, seldom reporting to gesture
or emphasis. He said that as counsel had
been "wandering in the fields and pluck-
Ing- the flowers of tloauence" he would
first give a plain statement of the Issues
Involved. Among those who came in to
hear the Attorney General was Repre
sentative Littlefield of Maine, whose
speech In the Porto Rico debate was one
of the most notable expressions on tho
status of the new Insular possessions.
Griggs Begins Argument.
Ings of divine Providence shall come un
der Its benign Influence and control. â¢
Mr. Harmon declared that both the
Philippines and Porto Rico are now and
have been since the treaty took effect a
part of the United States. They are the
property of the United States In the sense
that they are held in trust for the people
thereof. The trust is an express one. In
that Its conditions are fixed by the con
stitution. The builders of the republic
did not frame a constitution for the orig
inal thirteen States, but for all the lands
and peoples which in the beneficent work-
SUBSIDY BILL IS SURE TO PASS
Mr. Harmon" elaborated these main
points, dtlng and discussing- many deci
sions in support of them. In the course of
his argument Mr. Harmon conceded that
Congress* could govern the new territories
in any way It eaw fit, so long as the form
of government came within the constitu
tion; it might be by a governor of gov
ernor general, or by a commission, so long
as the form was not repugnant to the

toms officer confiscated the rings on the ,
ground that they came from the Philip
pines, were dutiable and had been smug
gled into the United States. The case now
conies up to the United States Supreme
Court on the appellant's plea that the
property was not subject -to customs
duties, the" Philippines being, as he con
tends, a part of the United' States. Mr.
Harmon directed the early part of his ar
gument to setting forth the fundamental
principles of equality which had been
enunciated by the Declaration of Inde
pendence. The chief points urged In his
argument were: By the treaty of peace
between the United States and Spain the
Philippines became a part of the United
States; the Government and the citizens
of the United States both entered said
islands under the authority of the consti
tution, with their respective rights de
fined and marked out; the former can ex
ercise no power over the person or prop
erty of a citizen of the United States be
yond what that Instrument confers, nor
iawfully deny any right which it has re
served. Belngra part of the United States,
the Philippine Islands are subject to the
provisions! of clause 1, section 8, article I.
and of clauses 5 and 6, section 9, article I
of the constitution of the United States.
And as there is nothing definitely stipu
lated in the treaty with respect to com
merce,- It became Instantly bound and
privileged by the laws which Congress
had passed to* raise a revenue from
| duties on imports and tonnage.
The President of the United States has
no legislative power. The imposition of
customs duties upon commerce between
these islands and other parts of the
United States after the treaty of peace
and exchange of ratifications by execu
tive order Is without lawful authority,
and the seizures of the property of the
plaintiff in error, a citizen of the United
States, under such pretended authority,
constitutes a taxing of his property with
out due process or law.
"WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.â Senator Mor

The Time* discusses McKinley's posi

declares that If the President has the

"The Senators, we are told. In their pres

We shall stand upon those rights. It is
not the custom of this country to con
clude treaties of surrender with any na
tion, even with those whose friendship we
value most That Is a custom from which
we have no mind to depart."
The paper refers to the vote on the Da

of the most essential provision of â¢ tho

probability of the Senate sanctioning
other amendments Involving explicit re

He contended for the safety of thÂ© ca
nal even though it should not be fortified,
for it was absurd, he said, to suppose
that j any enemy would attempt to Bail Its
ships through a canal 175 miles long and
owned, controlled and policed by this Gov
ernment when actual hostilities were in
progress.' In this connection he called at
tention to the fate of the Maine, Â«which
was on a peaceful mission, and had been
anchored in a harbor of a country with
which, at the time, we were at peace.
Senator Morgan traversed much of the
ground he had covered in his previous ar
guments In support of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty. He referred to the protocols
agreed to between Nicaragua and Costa
Rica regarding- the canal, and said that
the" ratification '. of the. Hay-Pauncefote
treaty was a debt we owed to them. Those
countries, If they should see fit, might
rise up and refuse to allow us to do any
thing; hence we could not afford to do
anything that would offend them. For this
reason we would' have the neutrality of
the canal assured and the pending treaty
ratified.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.-The friends of
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty occupied near
ly all of the time of the Senate in execu
tive session- to-day, Senators Foraker and
Morgan, being the speakers. â¢
Previous to taking up. the treaty the
Senate, for the purpose of clearing its cal
endar, disposed of several ; other, treaties
of Comparatively little Importance. Five
conventions In all | were ratified. Among
the doci/ments thus disposed of was an
agreement supplementary, to the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty Itself and extending the
time within which it may be ratified. Un
der the terms of the original 'treaty the
time for ratification expired five months
ago. The agreement favorably passed
upon to-day extends the time until the 4th
of March, during which the treaty may
be completed. Senator Lodge, who had
the matter- In- charge, manifested some
anxiety over this treaty, and evidently
was somewhat relieved when it went
through without a dissenting vote.
The other treaties . ratified were: Ex
tending for one year the time within
which -the commercial treaty with Argen
tina may be ratified; extending for a year
the time within which the treaty with
Great Britain for reciprocity with Jama
ica may be ratified; the new extradition
treaties with Bolivia and Chile.
When" the" Hay-Pauncefote treaty was
taken up attention was given to the reso
lution offered in open session earlier in
the day by Senator Tillman calling for the
correspondence between. this Government
and the Government of Colombia relative
to the right of the United States to con
struct a canal across Colombian territory.
The resolution was agreed to after It
was amended at the instance of Senator
Morgan so as to also call for all the corre
spondence with the Pan-American Canal
Company, Including all offers on the part
of that company and all negotiations with
It concerning the Panama canal.
Senator Bard of California/ gave notice
of an amendment which he will offer to
the treaty providing that the United
States shall have the right to '"discrimi
nate In favor of American goods shipped
through the canal in American vessels en
gaged In the coastwise trade."
Senator Foraker's speech, from first to
last, was a defense -of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty, and he took occasion to praise
in high terms Secretary Hay. who, he
said, is not only an accomplished gentle
man and scholarly man, but a patriot and
a statesman of a high order. Senator
Fcraker said he had differed from the*
Secretary in some respects aa to 'the pol
icy to be pursued, but any fair-minded
man must recognize that in negotiating
the pending treaty the Secretary of State
bad. accepted . conditions as he found
them.and that in falling Into the policy of
neutrality he had only followed historic
precedents. As for himself, he had al
ways favored an American policy In deal-
Ing with the question of the construction
of the canal, but no one who would give
the least attention to the subject could
not fall to see that the neutral policy had
been the policy of this country In the
past.

W^ASHINGTOX, Dec. 18.â The Senate
Committee on Finance to-day authorized
a favorable*" report on the House bill giv
ing the superintendents of coinage at
mints the right to exchange gold bars for
sold coin free of charge or with charge
at their discretion. The present law
makes the change mandatory.
The strikers refused to talk on the prob
ability of a sympathetic strike of the
other employes of the road, saying that
in the absence of President Dolphin, who
was expected here late to-night, they
larked information. The committee which
Â¦arm confer with the railroad officials con
sists of James Roddy, chairman of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers;
Thomas Burk, chairman of the Brother-
"From Information received It appears
the committee will endeavor to induce the
officials to adjust the differences which
caused the strike. So far as the strike
being over, it has only begun, and those
who are out are not at all worried over
the ultimate result. There have been few
desertions and evidence in hand is In
dicative that the better class of teleg
raphers who are out of work have no dis
position to take the places left vacant by
the union men." ' Â¦
J. R. T. Auston. vice president of the
Brotherhood of Commercial Telegraphers
and a member of the Order of Railway
Telegraphers, said:
The purpose of the meeting Is different,
ly regarded by the striking. telegraphers.
The latter declare that it is 'ridiculous to
suppose that men representing other
unions working- on the system called for
the conference to intercede with the offi
cials to reinstate the striking operators
as the strike has not been declared off
and the operators do not desire to return
to work.
Four of the sixty -eight cadets of the
second class were examined during the
afternoon and all cf them Â¦who knew Hccz
declared that his standing with his cÂ»ass
mates was not very high, as they iooKtd
upon him as a coward. The story of his
light wth KeMar in 1898 was told b> Â«."a
det O. 2Â»*. Tyler, who seconded Boez.
"When asked by the court why he did so,
Tyler said . ' Â¦ .
"WeM. Bcoz asked me to bÂ« ills second,
n.nÂ«l I rould not well refuse." --
Every ont, of the witnesses denied that
any hrutai hazing occurred, 'and two of
them cescJiiÂ»eJ the "bracing" and "set
ling up drills" as only "correctional meas
ures," and neither injurious nor humil
lstinjc. All denied. that Booz .had been
interfered v."ih on account of his religious
btlicf or ter.iencles. The inquiry is ex
tectf-d to take up the greater part of th'Â«
week.

"A committee consisting of the system

;mployment. The gentlemen composing
his committee, as representing the em
)loyee named, do. not sympathize with or
'upport the telegraphers' strike, but con
sider it a mistake. Their sympathy for
he men who have lost their positions has
nduced them to take action as here
lamed.
"We have a full force of telegraphers
employed on all our lines. Our business
s moving under normal conditions. Our

itatement follows:
CHICAGO, Dec IS.â According to a
statement issued to-night by J. M. Barr,
third vice, president of the Santa Fe Rail
way, the committee composed of repre-
hood of Locomotive Firemen;' William
W. Hutton.chairman of the Order of Rail
way Conductors; R. C. Scott, chairman of
th Â£x? rothernood of Railway- . Trainmen.
TOPEKA. Kan.. Dec. 18.â Santa Fe
switchmen and brakernen here say they
will strike if the demands of the tele
graph operators are not granted by Third
Vice President Barr. The conductors an
nounce that they will stay by the road,
but It is thought that they will be In
duced to join in the strike If one la or
dered. The engineers and firemen have
not said whether or not they will strike.
Considerable pressure haa been - brought
to bear on them, and they -show much
sympathy with the strikers.
. The Santa Fe officials are considerably
alarmed at the turn affairs have taken.
They are said to be endeavoring to hire
brakemen and switchmen conditiona-Uy
who shall take the places of the men
that go out.
The strikers here profess to be more
sanguine of success now than they have
oeen at any time since the beginning of
the strike.
It is probable that the result of the con
ference In Chicago between the. strike of
ficials and the officers of the road will not
be known for two days, and In the mean
time the brakemerL and switchmen are
preparing to go out in sympathy soon af
ter the refusal of the company to grant
the demands of the operators. If such a
refusal Is made. *
Third Vice President of the Santa Fe Declares the Reinstatement of Telegraphers Will
Be Requested at the Goming Conference.

SALARY TO BE INCREASED.
Porto Rican Education Commissioner
to Get Better Pay.
WASHINGTON. Dec IS.â At the re-
Quest of the Secretary of War, the House
Committee on Insular Affairs to-day re
ported a bill increasing the salary of the
Commissioner of Education of Porto Rico
fr< m fSXB to IffiOQ, When President Brum
bach of the University of Pennsylvania
accepted the position at the urgent re
quest cf the President and Secretary
Hoot, it was with the understanding that
his salary should be increased, fle re
ceived J5(W at the University of Pennsyl
\.inia and only accepted the position in
Porto Rico out of a sense of public duty.
The Ineular Committee to-day consid
ered the advisability of reporting a bill
to make it cl^ar that under the present
law only CnngTess shall have the power
to repeal, alter or amend charters in Porto
Rico. Some question has arisen as to
Â¦whether this power was lodged in Con
fr^js or in the Executive Council of Porto
Rico. The committee favors such a bill,
but no formal action was taken.
SWEPT from stem to stern and
with a decided list to starboard
the stout steamship Centennial
came Into San Francisco Bay
yesterday. Had the vessel not
been â¢well found and an excellent seaboat
she would never have reached port. All
but two of her lifeboats were washed
away. All the liferafts save one went by
the board. Tfce cabins were flooded. The
cocks were washed out of the galley.
The sailors were forced out of the fore
castle, and one terrific wave swept Cap
tain Egales from the bridge. It was a
trying time, but nevertheless the Centen
nial made port, and there is not a man
who came down on her but is willing to
swear by her as a splendid seaboat.
"We left Seattle about seven days ago,"
said Captain Egales yesterday. "We had
"All hands and the cook went to work,
and nearly all the bedding in the ship
not passed out of the straits before the
gale came up. The farther we Â¦went
routh the worse It got, ana when we
were off Blanco it was blowing a hurri
cane. One sea came aboard and carried
away two of the lifeboats. Another stove

third flooded the saloon and washed all
the passer.pers outof the after cabin.
We had eighty-six passengers all told,
and I don't believe that one of them es
caped a baptiFm.
"That all happened in the daytime. At
night the wind got up to about ninety
miles an hour, and then didn't things
hum! Three llferafts went by the board,
and the forward side of the saloon was
carried away. There was three feet of
wp.ter In the salocji. and 400 barrels of
lime not ten feet away.
"The morning after the gale I stood
away to the southwest and down upon
us It came again. All the starboard boats
were . carried away, and once more the
good old ship was -flooded. "When 'I came
to count noses I found that we had
elsrhty-slx passengers, a crew of about
eighty-five and only two small lifeboats
and one llferaft. But we pulled through."
was piled up as a barrier to keep the
water from that lime. When there. seemed
no chance for seepage we went to work
and baled the cabin out. Â«
"The gale cid not abate, however, and
the captain's gig followed the lifeboats,

from the hatches, the flrerooms were

The contemplated thanksgiving service
in St. Paul's Cathedrnl. in connection with
the return of Lord Roberts from South
Africa, has been abandoned, owing, as
the Government announces, "to its being
considered desirable to defer a general

now is for Lord Roberts to debark in the

JOHANNESBURG. Dec lS.-Details of
the defeat of the British at Nooit Gedaeht
indicate that General Clements' entire
force had a narrow escape from capture.
Tho Boers* plans were splendidly laiJ.
If the main British column had tarried
a little lor.per thfre would have been a
complete success for the Boers, who ex
posed themselves undauntedly, yelling and
waving their r.rms. Their rushes were
only stemmed by artillery.
After the British retreat the Boers held
g. prayer meeting. Their hymns could be
heard by the retiring British. All ac

In order to establish a monument in
celebration of . the semi-centennial of the
Temple Emanu-El, the ladies of the or
ganization will found an Emanu-El fel
lowship of Semitic languages at the State
University, of which Dr. Voorsanger is
now one of the' professors.
Rabbi Voorsanger. who has been con
nected with the congregation since 1SSS.
has prepared a memorial volume, entitled
"The Chronicles of Temple Emanu-El,"
which Is published by the board of direc
tors. This book is a valuable compilation
of the history of the congregation and
Rabbi Voorsanger was engaged for two
years in preparing the data.
The present officials of the congregation
are: Raphael Pelxotto, president; Jacob
Greenebaum, vice president: Henry Wan
genheim. secretary: Lippman Sachs,
treasurer; Emanuel Levy, clerk; E. J.
Stark, cantor, and Dr. Jacob Voorsanger,
rabbi.
The grand celebration to take .place at
the end of this week will be in marked
contrast to the first service 1 held by the
congregation. The founders â¢ of Temple
Emanu-El in 1849 gathered together in a
tent to keep alive the cherished beliefs of
their faith; their successors next Friday.
Saturday and Sunday will meet in one of
the handsomest places of worship in the
world.: Although .â¢ the -semi-centennial
should have been celebrated last July, it
will be held this week, more as a matter
of convenience to the majority of the
members, who would have been unable to
participate, owing to absence at the sum
mer resorts. : J
Â¦ The celebration will begin next Friday,
evening, when Rabbi Wise of Portland, Or.,
will deliver the thanKsgiving sermon. On
Saturday at the regular services Rabbi
Hecht of Los Angeles will occupy the pul
pir. and on Sunday afternoon Rabbi Voor
ar-ieer of the Temple Emanu-El will
preach. The services will include â¢ ad
dresses by the officials of the congrega
tion and special . vocal and musical num
bers. A large number of invitations have
been issued by the board of directors for
the "platform meeting" to be held on
Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The archives of the temple disclose the
names of the Seligmans, Wormsers, Sachs
and other leaders of finance who started
their colossal fortunes In the city of San
Francisco. Henry Seligman, brother of
the great financier, Jesse Seligman, was
at one time an officer of the temple and
is still alive, residing at i-'rankiort-on-
Maln In Germany.
The father of "Jake" Steppacher, the
well-known Republican politician, was for
many years sexton of the congregation
and "Jake" Steppacher figured as the
treasurer of a fair held by the young'
ladies of the organization some years agu 1
when $12,000 was raised to help the funds
of the temple.
The first private cemetery of San Fran
cisco belonged to the Temple Emanu-El.
the land having been donated by" one of
the early members. The site of the ceme
tery was in the Western Addition and has
long since been built over. Many noted
divines have preached from the pulpit of
the Congregation Temple Emanu-El and
to mention the names of those who have
been married under the- auspices of the
congregation would be to give a list of all
the prominent, persons in Jewish social
and business circles of the coast.
The rirst house of worship to be erected
by the Congregation Emanu-El was an
unpretentious wooden building, its loca
tion being in the downtown district of
to-day, since covered with palaces of com
merce. With the growth of the popula
tion of San .francisco the congregation of
Temple t;manu-.fcJl increased, resulting in
the Duilomg of the present house of wor
ship on Slitter street, wnich. v was dedi
cated in IStiS. With the completion of the
temple on Butter street the congregation
became absolutely rtiorm In its mode of
worship.
.Among the thousands who flocked to tho
far-off iÂ£ldorado after the discovery, of
gold by Marshall in 1A49 were many Jews,
ana it is interesting to note that one of
the very ursi things done by tnese plo
ceers was to establish a house of wor
ship. The first Jewjsn services to be held
on the Pacltic Coast tooK piace in a room
situated on Bush street, near Montgom
ery, and the original lease or' the prem
ises is one of the treasures of the,Con
gregation Emanu-Ei. The religious body
was. organized as a German orihooox one
and it was not until ten years later that
the change to a reform congregation \va3
started.
The fifty years' history of the Temple
Emanu-El forms an important part of the
life cf California and an inspection of the
valuable archives of the congregation
shows that many men who have been con-
nected. with the house of worship have
occupied prominent positions in every
walK of lite.
The semi-centennial celebration of the
founding of the^Jewlsh Congregation
Emanu-El will take place next Friday.
Saturday and- Sunday and the event Is at
tracting considerable attention all over
the country. ' ...

L| POX inc first I5age of the Denver Times on
I last Friday there was displayed in circus poster
type, "Storm Wrecks Frisco." Beneath was
an announcement in black-faced type that the worst
siorua in its history had swept over this city, that th<: ;
wires were down and San Francisco was cut off from
communication with 'he,world; then followed this:
"First Message Received â Word was received from
there early this morning, however, that the storm was
so heavy on the bay that the ferry-boats would have
to be stopped. The damage in San Francisco is
enormous, but no details as to the loss of life or prop
erty have yet been received, but it is likely that botii
will be heavy." *^{
That is the kind of tale our storm wind roared out !
as it swept eastward, startling the dwellers beyond the
Sierras with a fear that one of their own blizzards, or
cyclones, or tornadoes, or hurricanes, had broken
loose on this side the continent and was doing its
U5tial damage.
Probably California weather will never be under
stood in the East. Indeed, it is difficult to understand
it here. The hottest days of our summers in the hot
test parts of the State do not produce sunstroke as
they do in the East, and when we have a winter storm
i' is quite a different thing . fromVwhat such a storm
would be on the other side of the continent.
San Francisco has not been wrecked, and the loss
neither of life nor of property has been enormous.

Here is a lesson to be learned by all who are inter

BHHHflHKÂ»riB99B9HBlHBBBBg':::-
It is doubtful if New York City has really profited
much by its political reformers. It has had more re
form movements than any other city in the country,
rnd yet it remains under the control of Tammany.
The reason is not far to seek. At this very juncture
it is stated that certain representatives of the indepen
dent Germans of the city have given notice they are
willing to join the fight against Tammany 1 for good
government, but will vote for Tammany rather than
support a movement to curtail personal liberty. One
of them, ex-Sheriff Tamsen, is quoted as saying: "We
are not going to countenance any movement like that
of 1895, when all the saloons and places of amusement
were closed on Sunday."
thus lead to its defeat.
There is an immense amount of significance in this
antagonism among the people of New York to the
word "reform." It teaches a lesson of past follies
and blunders on the part of zealous men eager for the
improvement of their city and their fellow citizens that
should not be lost upon any portion of the American
public. Not in New York only has "reform" come to
be regarded as a sort of charity word-that covers a
multitude of sins. In almost every city in this coun
try when a considerable body of men have organized
for the purpose of redressing political evils by political
methods there comes to the front as allies in the
movement a host of, men who do more harm than
good. The mere office-seekers in the crowd are by
no means the most dangerous. It often happens that
men of genuine 'earnestness and free from all taint
of self-seeking injure the cause they desire to help
by joining .to it some moral reform that can neves*
be effected by, government. These people have the
idea that the only way to get rid of a corrupt munici
pal administration is to enforce sumptuary laws, tem
perance laws and many other taws that affect matters
of conscience rather than of politics, and consequently
they rouse up antagonism to the whole movement and
The correspondent of the Philadelphia Public Led
ger in explaining the causes of this desire on the part
of the committee" says: "The word with a good many
people means only a political scheme to get office by
turning somebody else out. Among politicians the
word is as malodorous as mugwumpery itself. To
them it means a blow at party organization and party
discipline. Among a large class of merchants, espe
cially retailers,. the word is associated with an admin
istration of affairs which, by a series of corrections of
petty abuses, seriously injures their business. Among
the Germans 'reform' is dreaded as too often meaning
interference with personal liberty and cherished na
tional customs. So everybody is trying to get rid of
the word, although it is the best with which to de
scribe the present movement."
i â ;RQM New York City comes the report that the
I committee of fifteen charged' with the duty ot
* organizing a citizens' movement against Tam
many Hall in the approaching municipal campaign is
doing its uttermost to prevent the undertaking from
becoming known as a "reform movement." In fact,
they are seeking to get rid of the word "reform" al
together, being convinced they will have a much bet
ter chance of success if their campaign is freed from
that word and all of its associations.
UNPOPULAR REFORM MOVEMENTS.
The stock-growers of the West who are just now the
victims of criticisms because of the advance in the
price of meat would do well to send representatives
to study the effect of the leasing system in Australia
and Texas.
In Texas there has been no complaint of encroach
ment upon the rights of the agricultural settler, or of
the small stock men. The latter, especially, are bene
fited, for they secure leases and become larger own
ers through the renewal of the grasses on their lease
hold, which thereby becomes able to support more
cattle.
The increase in the number of cattle carried by a
given area of the leased range has followed a system
of rotation in feeding. Having control of his range
under a leasehold, the stock-owner follows the Aus
tralian system of changing his stock from one pan
of the range to another, permitting the pasture to re
cuperate, and especially enabling the grasses to resced
themselves. In this way the vast plains of Texas, that
were so reduced that it no longer paid to run stock on
them, have been renewed and show almost the primi
tive vigor of their grasses.
The revenue derived by the State from the leases
is large, and the stock men who pay it do so cheer
fully, and would by no means return to the free range
system.
Texas foilowcd the example of Australia, and has
thereby established an object lt-sson at home which
the producers and consumers of beef, mutton and
wool may well study.
The only increase in range cattle in the last six yeari
comes from Texas. Everywhere else the decline in
such cattle is marked, having reached 66 per cent.
This is due to the Texas policy of leasing the range
and not permitting it to be destroj-ed by use in com
mon.
TH E report of the Secretary of Agriculture takes
notice of the improvement in the cattle ranges
of Texas. Their capacity for carrying cattle had
fallen very low, through disappearance of the grasses
and other forage. Now it is rising again, so that the
range carries one-third more cattle than formerly.

The Meanest Man.
Surely it is time to enact a national pure food law;
to make it sufficiently comprehensive to include all
manner of food and drink; and to enforce it with -an
undeyiating strictness.'.
The point of importance in the story, is that the poi
soning was the result of making so-called "sugar" out
of glucose and sulphuric acid. It is well known that
glucose is extensively used infa large number. of food
adulterations and the claim. has been always made that
it is harmless. The British ' have now learned that
such claims are invalid. In fact, "sophistication" has
been carried one step too far. ] The sulphuric acid
used in. sweetening the glucose has itself 'been sub
jected to sophisticating processes and. is not always
chemically pure.
"It was at first suspected that in the process of
dressing the hops arsenic might have been derived
from the sulphur employed, but it is now evident that
the source of the poison is to be found in the sulphuric
acid employed in the preparation o( the glucose or
sugar now largely used in the making of beer/ The
glucose is made from maize, rice and other plant
products which contain much starch. It is boiled with
the acid, as an ordinary' practice, and if the acid is not
chemically pure, its arsenical constituents are bound
to be addedvto the sugar, and hence must necessarily
contaminate the beer. The remedy is obviousâname
ly, the use of chemically pure acid only. It is a little
disturbing, I confess, to'fihd arsenic cropping up so
often of late days -in unexpected -places. Recently
phosphate of soda Supplied to certain chemists, and
widely used as an antacid and aperient, was found to
be dangerously contaminated with this poison. But'
tHe occurrence of the cases under notice will have
one good result in serving as a warning against
future danger and in promoting the manufacture of
chemically pure products."
After some further statements concerning the his
tory of the cases and citing others of a similar charac
ter scattered over a wide region of country, Dr. Wil
son returned to the cause of the evil and said:
In aVecent issue of the London Chronicle Dr. Rob
ert Wilson, an eminent authority on such subjects,
discussed the matter and gave*' what' may be regarded
as an authentic account of it! He says certain physi
cians in Manchester "met with a number of cases of
an affection which is known to men as
'neuritis,' a term indicating nervous disturbance of a
fairly, definite order and usually produced by certain
causes, among which excess in alcohol stands out in
due prominence." Investigation showed that the
beer-drinkers affected in the cases under considera
tion had notused'an excessive quantity, and accord
ingly the beer was tested for poisons, with the result
ing discovery that it contained arsenic.
f~* REAT BRITAIN has just had a lesson in the
I """I evil results of sophisticated food stuffs that is
very nearly as important to us as it is to the
British, for in this country the science and the prac
tice of such sophistications are carried just about' as
far as in any other land in the world. The British
lesson has been derived from the recent "beer poison
ings," as they are called; which have taken place in
and around Manchester, and of which somewhit
exaggerated reports have been widely published.

Many benefits are therefore likely to be derived
from the proposed ordinance, and Supervisor Booth
is to be congratulated for having been so prompt to
perceive the moral of the lesson taught by the storm
in that respect.
It is to be borne in: mind, moreover, that such
fences are to be condemned for other reasons than
that of the danger with Which they menace the pub
lic. They are unsightly and offensive in themselves.
They mar the appearance. of a city, and not infre
quently they are injurious to the business value of ad
"jcining property. Sometimes they even delay the con
struction of buildings, for when persons who have
bought lots for speculative purposes find they can
erect an advertising fence and derive from it a revenue
sufficient to pay taxe3, they will keep the property un
improved much longer than would otherwise be the
case.
The lesson of the gale teach-es, that high fences are
dangerous when erected along the sidewalks. It was
due to good fortune more than to anything else that a
considerable number of people were not seriously in
jured when so many of the rickety. structures were
blown down by the winds. It is certainly advisable
to take no such risks in the future, and consequently
Mr. Booth's proposed ordinance should" be reported
favorably from the committee and unanimously
adopted.
For some years there has been a vigorous campaign
of education on this subject in every progressive city
in the Union. From New, York, Chicago, Philadel
phia and. Boston alike come reports from time to
time of efforts made to abolish the nuisance. These
efforts sooner or later will-be crowned with success,
and it is to be hoped San Francisco will be -a leader
and not a laggard in the movement ,-.
SHOULD'the lesson taught by the recent gale that
swept over this' city have the effect of inducing
the Supervisors' to enact the ordinance intro
duced by Supervisor Booth restricting sidewalk fences
to a height not exceeding seven feet, the community
will find thayhe storm has been profitable in more
ways than, one. ;The high, fence is among the Worst
nuisances of American cities. It has' been' already too
long tolerated, and it is full time to put an end to it.

PERSONAL MENTION.
a good government to regulate the whole domain of
morality; The persistence of men in uniting' good
government movements with various moral reforms
enables corrupt politicians to win in almost . every
encounter.' The committee now : aranging for Â¦ the
fight. for genuine political and administrative reform
in New York is not going to make th'aV mistake this
time, and ; consequently the prospect of the over
throw of Tammany is better than it has been for. many
a year.' . ' ' $gi%Â£Â£v0.
The coming year, promises to be an exceptionally
good one for big yacht races. Boston is to build a
boat to compete against that of Ne\t York for the
honor of defending the America's cup against Sham
rock II; and the race between the home rivals will be
hardly less exciting than that against the British
yacht.
We are quite sure that such action would finally rc
dound to the honor of American Christianity, and
would cause the Chinese to receive our missionaries
with favor in all places where they may properly go.
It is to be hoped that the va-ious American mis
sionary societies will call attention to this forgery in
tneir coming meetings this winter by refusing to send
missionaries into the Middle Kingdom at all, giving
as a reason that in the treaty of i860 China did not
intend to grant, nor France and England to exact,
permission for them to go there.
Suppose that our treaty with China upon which the
exclusion act is based had been forged out of shape
by providing that coolies may come and may become
citizens, how long would this country have permitted
it to go unprotested and uncorrected?
Cardinal Vaughan evidently has in mind the bene
fit that will follow if :he other nations treat China
as they would each other. Not one of them would
for a day endure aggression under protection of a
forged clause in a treaty.
We are of opinion that the future position of the
missionaries in that country, and the future relations
of the Western powers to that empire, .would be much
improved if this forgery were confessed and the wrong
righted.
The Cardinal's view is so reasonable, coming from
a leader in the greatest of the missionary churches,
that it will call attention to the fact that missionary
work in China has been made for all the future more
risky and less useful by the forgery of the treaty and
the seizure of territory. It would have added to the
strength of his pastoral letter if he had frankly told
the story of the forgery, and put to the conscience of
the Christian world the question whether it can afford
to rest its rights in China upon a crime.
The literati and diplomats of China became aware
of this forgery, but were powerless to correct it.
Knowledge of its existence spread among the people,
and they came to look upon the missionaries bad
people, who-had invaded their country under protec
tion of the crime of forgery. Therefore they were
minded to treat them as having no business there, just
a* in California the Chinese are treated in various lo
calities where they have been robbed and in some
cases killed.
In his view the trouble began when Germany
seized Chinese territory as indemnity for the murder
of two missionaries in Shantung. The Chinese saw
in that act that they must submit to the overthrow of
their system of morality and ethics or pay territory as
the price of resistance. The Cardinal might have
gone still further back 'for a beginning of the current
troubles. They began when a French missionary
forged into the treaty of i860 a clause permitting the
missionaries to penetrate the Middle Kingdom. When
that treaty was made neither France nor England
contemplated any privileges for the missionaries out-,
side of the treaty ports, and their copies of the treaty
were innocent of the forged clause which the criminal
missionary interpolated into tlie Chinese treaty.
f-* ARDINAL VAUGHAN has issued a pastoral
( letter on the Chinese question to the English
Bishops of the Catholic church. The Cardinal
regrets that the conduct of the Western powers, no
tably Russia and Germany, has caused the Boxer out
break and identifies Christianity and politics in the
Chinese mind.

Captain Harde and A. P. Mordaunt, on
tho steam tug Milton, made a grrewsome
discovery yesterday morning. They paid
a visit to the schooner Carrie and Annie,
which was. lying. at anchor In the stream.
As they approached the schooner they
shouted for the watchman, an old man
named W. B. Barnes, but they failed to
elicit a response. Drawing still nearer
they saw the body of the old watchman
hanging over the side of a small skiff
belonging to the schooner, his head dip
ping in the water.
without loss of time they took the
.body aboard â¢ the tug and Â¦* attempted to
resuscitate It, but after laboring for more
than half an hour they gave up the task,
being convinced, that the man bad died
.before they had seen him. .
The : Coroner was â¢ notified and â¢ the body
-was removed to the Morgue. It Is thought
that Barnes was seized with a fit or
fainting spell and fell over the side. of
the skiff. He was a bachelor about 63
years old,' and lived at 2006 Powell street.

PHH*ADEL.PHIA.. Dec. IS.â <Jovernment
ownership of a Pacific cable was discussed
last nig-ht by the members of the Manu
facturers' Club. Brigradler General Gree
ly. United States chief signal officer, ani
Dr. E. J. Kennealey. president of the
American Irjstitute of Electrical Engi
neers, participated In the discussion. T.
E. Hughes of this city emphasized the
military and strategic necessity. He esti
mated the cost for 7T&9 nautical miles at
510.Oo0.000. requiring an earning capacity of
$925,000 a year. The cable tolls of the War
Department alone, however, it was point
ed out, have averaged monthly a rate of
more than So^.OcO, and at current rates
the projected cable need be in operation
less thELii an hour a day to earn the $325,
Â©00.
General Greely said: "The cable expe
riences of the War Department in connec
tion with the relief of the legations at
Peking point clearly to the tremendous
disadvantages under which the United
Prates without its own facilities would la
bor in case of an extended war In the
East. An American tranE-Padflc cable ia
a military ar.d commercial necessity if
our colonial possessions are to be retained
or if American interests are to be safe
guarded in Asiatic countries. The great
value of a cable is more especially for the
restoring- of order In new colonies and to
facilitate commercial enterprises.""
The club adopted a resolution approving
the Corliss bill.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
HEWS OF THE OCEAN.
A new order has been Issued by the
Government, and there Is much discontent
among the ladles In consequence. Until
the Volunteers are all safely home no
women will be allowed to travel on the
transports. Females who want to come
home or go to Manila will for some
months to come have to patronize the
mall steamers.
Chief Officer Goodall of the Hancock has
resigned and Second Officer Angers has
been promoted to the vacancy.
There was a short strike on the Law
ton yesterday. Many of the crew demand
a "shore allowance" besides their pay
and Uncle Sam won't pay It The trans
port is receiving an overhauling and the
boys eay they should get their pay and
"meal money" as well until the repairs
are made. There are about 150 men clam
oring for the strikers' places, so the whole
matter will probably be adjusted to-day.
A dispatch to the Merchants' Exchange
states that the steamer Newsboy went
ashore near Fort Bragg yesterday, but
was floated off without being injured.
Water Front Notes.
The British ships Dltton and Crown of
England made port early yesterday morn
ing and both masters report very heavy
weather outside. The Dltton took a pilot
aboard December 12 and then had to
stand off chore. In attempts to make the
north channel a number of sails were
blown away and the captain finally de
cided that a towboat was cheaper than
canvas and came in behind a tug.
The Crown of England â¢ bad most of
her heavy weather off the Platte. She
did not reach the bar until the 15th and
then took a pilot and since then she has
been strfhdlng on and off, awaiting a
chance to come in.
All coasting steamers have made long
trips and some of them have still to be
heard from.
in Making Fort.
REPORT HEA.VY "WEATHER.
British Ships Have Some Difficulty
There are about eighty-six Asiatics on
the Government transport Hancock and
every one of them tvÂ«l be shipped back: to
China on the Coptic next Friday. Uncle
Sam has been trying to get rid of his
Mongolian labor tor many months, but
the difficulty of getting good men to fill
their places has caused a delay. On Fri
day morning flfty-slx white firemen and
coal passers will replace the Chinese and
about thirty .waiters will take the places
of the Mongolians In the saloon. .' As a
result of these changes the Hancock. will
have an entire white crew and the Coptic
will have an additional eighty-six passen
gers all of whose passages will be paid
by Uncle Sam.

WASHINGTON, Dec 18.â A message
from United States Consul Gummery at
Tangiers Informs the State Department
that the Moorish Government had settled
the claim of the United States for $5000
indemnity on account of the murder of
Marcus Eszagui, a naturalized American
citizen, in Morocco last spring.
Eszagui was of French birth, but the
fact that, he was naturalized as an Amer
ican citizen relieved the French Govern
ment from the necessity of joining in the
demand for indemnity. The Moorish Gov
ernment pleaded as a basis for Its first
declination to pay the fact that the man
was killed, not by Moorish officers, but
in o fight with the rabble. The claim for
indemnity, however, was based on the
failure of the Moorish Government to
make any effort to arrest or punish the
perpetrators of the murder. The Navy
Department, at the Instance of the State
Department, was making arrangements
to 5-end a naval vessel to Morocco to give
moral support to the demands of the
American Consul for a settlement.
Settles Claim for the Murder
of a Naturalized
Citizen.

THE INDEMNITY
LONDON, Dec. 19.â "Great Britain's
proposed alterations in the preamble of
the joint note have been practically ac
cepted by all the powers," says the Pe
'klng correspondent of the Dally Mail, wir
ing Monday. "Both Russia and Japan,
whose support was regarded as doubtful,
have agreed. Only the attitude of the
United States remains as yet not clearly
uenned and the acquiescence of America
is anticipated, and it is probable that th-3
Joint note will be signed and delivered to
the Chinese plenipotentiaries within three
of four days. The German Minister has
warmly supported the British proposal."
PEKING, Dec. 18.â Count von Walder
see has issued an order assigning certain
districts In the neighborhood of Peking
for supervision to the representatives of
the various powers. The order says thÂ«s
extent" to which the co-operation of the
French and American troops can be dj
pended upon is a matter to be determined
by agreements made with the generals
commanding these forces. Under the plan
the United States troops will supervise
the district southwest of Peking from the
road to Tshangtshang to the road extend
ing from Nakukrin to Hosiwu.
Count von Waldersee says he knows
that there is a considerable force of Chi
nese under General Ma In the northern
part of the province of . Shansi and
another south of Tsh,angtshang, but dur
ing the severe winter that haa now set in
he does, not expect any aggressive Chi
nese movement.
On the other hand, wherever the allies
leave a district for any length of time
bands of robbers and thugs will congre
gate. For tnis reason the field marshal
desires the co-operation of all the allies
to cover the various districts with strong
patrols. It is now understood that * a
meeting of the foreign envoys will be held
to-morrow. ;
Proposed Change in De

MEMPHIS, Tenri., -Dec. 18.â In one of
the gamest exhibitions ever witnessed in
a Memphis prizerlng Kid McFadden of
San Francisco was given the decision
over Casper Leon of New York, at the
end of twenty rounds of fierce fighting be
fore the Phoenix Athletic Club.
Both men entered the ring in the pink
of condition. McFadden had a slight ad
vantage in weight, while Leon had height
in his favor. McFadden promptly took
the aggressive, forcing Leon around the
ring, but landing few effective blows,
while the New York man worked slower
and more effectively.
- It was give and take with hardly a
shade of advantage either way up to the
fifteenth round, when McFadden's youth
and strength began to tell.
Leon was forced to take the count twice
In this round, but fought gamely and
came up for the sixteenth strong again.
McFadden fought sa,vagely for a knock
out in each succeeding round, but Leon's
staying qualities and ring generalship en
abled him to make almost as strong a
showing in the final rounds as. he did in
tho initial one. McFadden's aggressive
ness, however, gave him the decision.

Forrest for third place.

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
CHICAGO, Dec. IS.â The conference on
arbitration and conciliation was enlivened
during the day by a debate between Sam
uel Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, and Hugh H. Lusk,
ex-member of Parliament of New Zea
land. The venerable New Zealander dur
ing the forenoon turned aside from his
prepared address to express displeasure
at a declaration made by Mr. Gompers in
his address last night. The labor leader
on the occasion mentioned asserted that
he warned to see labor organizations re
tain the privilege of striking when they
pleased, why they pieased or merely be
cause they pleased.
"Tha.t is not liberty." cried Mr. Lusk.
"It is license.'*
At this moment Mr. Gompers entered.
The speaker continued:
"Mr. Gompers wants, conciliation and he
s-ays you can never have any conciliation
unless you are ready to cui one another's
throats. Well, it that Is the unfortunate
condition of the people of America 1 am
sorry tor them. We are not so anxious
to cut one another's throats where I came
from. I wish Mr. Gompers had taken the
trouble to Jind out what our compulsory
-rbiiration law is before he told you
about It, but. as he did not, 1 am obliged
to do It for him."
During the afternoon Mr. Gompers se
cured the stage and reiterated his asser
tions of the night previous.
"We do not elutcn each other's throats
unnecessarily, but I would rather have
the right to clutch at a man's throat
than to have my arms amputated. The
compulsory labor law is equivalent to the
amputation referred to," he said. "I want
labor to have the strength of a giant, but
10 use that strength gently."
Following this two speeches were sand
wiched in and then Mr. L.usk again se
cured the floor. He explained at length
the workings of the arbitration courts of
New Zealand, generally talking straight
at the labor president.
"You would cut my arms off In your
country." paid Mr. Gompers, speaking
from his seat.
"If you were good we would not ampu
tate your arms," replied the New Zea
lander, "but we might enlarge your
head."
A lively exchange of questions and an
swers which bewildered the audience fol
lowed. Mr. Lusk explained that during the
hearing of a dispute between an employer
_.nd his unionized employes neither could,
under penalty, change the conditions
which caused the appeal to the arbitra
tion court. The hearing, during which
neither side had the right to independent
action generally lasted about a month.
"I'd rather be at sword's points in
America and Independent than to sur
render my right to strike for one minute,'*
shouted Sir. Gompers. And with that he
left the hall.
Aside from skirmishes between these
two men, axid they toolc up considerable
time, there were numerous speeches, all
iavoring voluntary arbitration. Even Mr.
L_sk declared that America was not
ready for compulsory arbitration.

AUSTRALIAN FIGHTER
READY FOR THE MILL
Jg BERKELEY. Dec. 18.-Columbfa College
sent its final answer to California to-day,
stating that the team could not come
West. Negotiations have ceased and the
games have been declared conceled.
Columbia's reason for refusing to meet
the local team was not on account of a
disagreement over financial terms. It was
on account of -faculty intervention. The
text of the message to Graduate Manager
Reno Hutchlnson was as follows:
"Faculty refuse to allow team to take
Western trip."
â¢The result of the negotiations with Co
lumbia has been a disappointment to
many of the Berkeley football men. Oth
ers did not care and some of the men
who have not visited their homes for two
or three years are looking forward to
Christmas dinner with their parents with
considerable more relish than a Christ
mas day on the gridiron. Manager Hutch
inson. who all along had some doubts re
garding how the games would come out
financially, Is somewhat relieved now that
negotiations have ceased. Captain C. A.
Pringle is disappointed.
Berkeley was to have commenced-prac
tice to-day, with Coach Addlson Kelly in
charge of the team. Orval Overall, the
big freshman guard, and Harry Hudson,
end; had been sent for to return to Berke
ley. Both men had completed their ex
aminations and had gone to their homes,
Overall to Visalla and Hudson to Marys
ville/. â¢
Columbia originally opened negotiations
with California, proposing two games, one
In San Francisco on Christmas day and
the. other in Los Angeles on New Years.
The members of the Berkeley team met
together and voted to play. No definite
agreement could be reached by the two
managements on finances. California of
fered Columbia all expenses and 50 per
cent of the net proceeds. Columbia want
ed a guarantee that the 50 per cent would
be at least $2000. Negotiations over this
point were still pending when Columbia's
expected message was received.

The courts, as we have learned, started
out boldly with the rule that employers
must select suitable employes, appliances,
places for working, and also give all
proper instructions. Moreover, this was a '
positive thing they must do. If an em
ployer, however, did not attend to this
primary duty himself, but asked another
to do It for him, he was, nevertheless,
held just as strictly as though he had
done the act, or omitted to do It. himself.
He could not shield himself by saying
that he had appointed another whom ho
supposed was competent to do this for
him, and who had proved unfaithful. One
of the most frequently quoted utterances
on this subject is that of the Court of
Appeals of New Yorjt given in Fllke's
case. "The true rule, I apprehend," said
Mr. Chief Justice Church. "i3 to hold the
corporation liable for negligence or want
of proper care in respect to such acts and
duties as it is required to perform and
discharge as master or principal, without
regard to the rank or title of the agent
intrusted with their performance. As to
such acts the agent occupies the place of
the corporation, and the latter should be
deemed present and consequently liable
for the manner in which they are per
formed. If an agent employs unfit ser
vants his fault is that of the corporation,
because it occurred in the performance of
the principal's duty, although only an
agent himself. So in providing machinery
or materials, and In the general arrange-,
ment and management of the business, he
is in the discharge of the duty pertaining
to the principal."
Who Is Liable for Changing Time
Tables?
There is an important distinction or lim
itation to this rule that ought to be men
tioned here. It is the duty of a railroad
to make a general time table with respect
to the running of its trains. If It does
this through the agency of another his
act is nevertheless the company's, and if
there should be any mistake or neglignce
in doing this it would be that of tho
company. But suppose there should be a
special order for the running of a train,
as often happensâ what then? This was
Fllke's case, and he was injured in conse
quence of it. His counsel contended that
the act of arranging and promulgating a
general time table by a railroad was the
duty and act of the company, and that
when there is a variation from the gen
eral time table for a special occasion, as
there was in this case, it is as much tha
duty and act of the master as the making
of the original one. Furthermore, if an
other does this for him, if he acts through
an agent, he must be responsible for that
agent as though he did this himself.
The court tn answering this argument
declared that no one doubted the com
pany's right to vary its time table. It
was at times necessary to do this, and the
necessity was so frequent as to fall within
the occurrences a railway servant is
bound to expect in the course of his em
ployment. "It is not true," says Mr. Chief
Justice Folger, "that, on an occasion like
this, it is the duty of the master, or a part
of his contract, to tee to It, as with a per
sonal right, that notice of u temporary
anJ social interference with the general
time table comes to the intelligent appre
hension of all those whom it is to govern
in the running of approaching trains. It is
utterly impracticaDie so to do, and a
brakeman or a foreman on a train knows
that it Is, as well as any person conectcd
with the business. He knows that trains
will often and unexpectedly require to be
storped and started by telegraphic orders
from distant points, and that such orders
must, from the nature of the case, be
given through servants skilled In receiving
and tranamiHing them. If there is due
care and diligence In choosing competent
persons for that duty, a negligence by
them in the performance of it Is a risk
of the employment that the coemploye
takes when he enters the service." The
court, therefore, drew a distinction be
tween an employer's duty and responsibil
ity in making and promulgating a general
time table and a special one. In the case
of a general cne this must be regarded as
the act of the master, and if he appoints
an r.gent to do the work for him he is
holden for the consequences the same as
though he had done the work himself. In
ether words, this is a personal act of the
employer, and he cannot stamp It with a
different character by asking some one
else to do the work for, him; in law it is
Still his own. .
But the changing of a time table is
a different thing. This can be done by an
other and the employer is not held respon
sible for his act. So he was not held in
the case above mentioned. The question
then arises, When can he act through
another in making changes without sub
jecting himself? Very rarely are railroad
time tables wholly changed; the changes
are not frequent and perhaps a court
would hold that in all such the changes
are to be regarded as the acts of its ser
vants and not its own. At all events, the
court has drawn such a fine distinction
that it will be difficult, we imagine, to
determine in many cases whether the
change is to be regarded as the personal
act of the employer for which he is re
sponslMe. or that of his agent for which
he is not. Possibly, the court might say
that even a single general change was
that of the employer, while all special or
temporary changes were to be regarded as
those of its agents.
Duty of Employes When Rules Exist.
Employes In many cases know the regu
lations exist, and when they do it is their
duty to find out what they are. This is
especially true of railroads. Thus a rail
road company had a printed rule requiring
each conductor before moving his train to
inform himself of Its condition. The con
ductor failed to do so, and was injured by
a defective brake, which he would, have
discovered had he used ordinary care in
his inspection. He failed to recover.
Disobedience of Orders.
If an employe has disobeyed a positive
order or rule he should be discharged, and
not to do this Is negligence. Thus a com
pany was notified that Its engineers gave
the control of Its engines to firemen in di
rect violation of its orders. Clearly the
company should have discharged them af
ter receiving such a notice.
Minors.
Another class of employes must now be
noticedâ minors. â¢ The law seeks to Impose
a graver duty on employers with respect
to making regulations and informing them
of dangers. This is. because of their inex
perience. :*Â¦â¢â¢.-
We have seen that it is the duty of an
employer to make known any defects con
cerning appliances, or place of working,
that areÂ»not likely to be seen by a work
man of ordinary observation, and if he
falls to do this he Is liable. In other words,
It is an employer's duty to put his em
ploye on the same plane as himself with
respect to his knowledge of an appliance
he is to use. Â¦ ; Â¦ â¢-
Minors are presumed to know less than
adults, and therefore the duty of employ
ers to give them more rules and instruc
tions Is greater. The duty to instruct a
child varies with his age and capacity.
Said Mr. Justice Hunt, of the Supreme
Court of the United States: "The conduct
of an infant of tender years is not to be
judged by the same rule which governs
that .of an adult. The care and
caution required of a child is according
to his maturity and capacity only, and this
Is to be determined in each case by tha
circumstances of that case." .
Fagg vs. McGeorge. â¢
A very good statement of the law has
been made by the Supreme Court of Penn
sylvania: "When young persons without
experience are employed to work with
dangerous machines it is the duty of the
employer to give suitable Instructions as
to the manner of using them, and warn
ing as to the hazard of carelessness in
their use. If the employer neglect this
duty, or if ho give improper instructions,
he Â» responsible for the injury resulting
from his neglect of duty. He is not an
swerable for injury to adults, nor for the
injuries to young persons who have had
that' experience from which knowledge of
danger may be reasonably presumed and
that discretion which prompts to care."
In the case in which this rule was stated
a boy 13 years old was injured. while at
tempting to clean (not a real four-legged
live mule, while in motion), but a "wood
en" ' one,- It -was a dangerous piece of
machinery even to an adult workman. The
evidence did not clearly prove that he had
received I any ' Instructions from the f ore-
LITTLE REGINA LEE, as her Cau
casian mother, Hettie Lee, calls
her; Ah Tui, es Lee Ning Toeng,
the Chinese who says he i9 her
father, is pleased to refer to her,
will be taken from her home In the heart
of the Mongolian quarter. Judge Coffey
at the conclusion of the hearing of the
petition of Secretary Kane of the Society
for the Suppression of Vice for letters of
guardianship upon the person of the little
miss, decided that longer life at the home
of her birth would be fatal to the child's
moral welfare. A guardian more suitable
to the parents than Secretary Kane will
be appointed, however, and then Regina
Lee will begin to learn the ways of the
Christian t world and to forget, her life
up among the dens and odors of China
town.
When the case was called yesterday
Mrs. Minnie Brown, Honora L. Banks
and Donaldlna Cameron were called to
the stand and all testified that the child
was not properly cared for; that she was
allowed to parade the streets after night
fall and to frequent places where Chi
nese may buy liquor. The testimony,
however, - was all to the effect that th*
mother was orderly and industrious anu
that the father was an industrious Chris
tianized Chinese employed by Mrs. Geor
giana Hyman at a salary sufficient to
secure comfort for his wife and daughter.
Their respectability did not remove the
ban of the child's environment, however,
and the court has decided that she must
be taken away.
In the interim the child will remain In
the custody of her parents, in the home
where as witnesses stated the Chinese
came to pet and carets her and where the
court said moral ruin was working Its
way.
"I have no doubt but that this child
would step from ball to worse if per
mitted â¬o live longer In "Waverly place.
She is In danger of being destroved as a
citizen, which gives this court jurisdiction
to act in the premises. I do not want to
take her away from her parents, but from
her environment. Hence next Friday I
will appoint a guardian to care for her
at a place where her parents can visit
her."
Little Regina was called to the bench
by Judge Coffey and in answer to the
question, of the jurist pointed at the Chi
nese occupying the witness stand and
said . in broken English: "Regina, my
name. He my father." Judge Coffey ex
amined the features of the child minutely
and gave his decision.
"The legal presumption that this Chi
nese is the father of this child controls
the court," said Judge Cortey. "He 13
her father under the law, and notwith
standing the prejudice against his race
he is not incompetent to be her guardian
and protector. He is industrious and is
commended by his employer and is doubt
less truthful, but I do not believe that he
is the father of this child. Her mother
is living In a localityâ Waverly placeâ so
notorious that its name was changed by
law that the people might forget Its ex
istence, but it has only been changed
from a white to a Chinese place of vice.
REGINA LEE, THE LITTLE CHILD WHO HAS BEEN ORDERED TAKEN
AWAY FROM HER HOME IN CHINATOWN. AND THE CHINESE
HUSBAND OF HER MOTHER. V r -
man, or that he had. by experience, or In
any other way gained a knowledge of the
machine and of the danger of attempting
to clean it while it was running. The court
held that this was a proper case for the
jury to decide whether the boy had re
ceived needful instruction.
An. Operator in an Iron "Mill.
In another Pennsylvania case a youth
about seventeen years old and recently
employed In an Iron mill was hired for
one duty, but injured while doing, by di
rection of the foreman, another. ThÂ»
court of review remarked that in tne case
of young persons it was the duty of the
employer to take notice of their age and
ability and to use ordinary care to pro
tect them from risks Wr.ich th#y could
not properly appreciate and to which they
should not be exposed. "Tho duty in such,
cases to warn and Instruct grows natur
ally out of the ignorance or inexperience
of the employe, and it does not extend to
those who are of mature years and who
are familiar with the employment and its
risks." In the case to which these re
marks were applied the boy had had but
very little acquaintance with hia work. He
went into the mill on Tuesday and waa In
jured the fourth day afterward. He was
injured while closing a gate between two
pairs cf rollers. The cogwheels by which
the rollers were moved were covered along
the whole length of the train except at the
point over which he had to reach to open
end close the gate. If they had been cov
ered there the accident would not have hap
pened. "In view of the youth and want of
experience in the business on his part it
was necessarily a question for the Jury
whether his employer had sufficiently
warned and Instructed him about the dan
gers of the employment, and how to avoid
them, or had done all that waa reasonably
necessary to protect him from injury."
An Operator In a Cotton ts\\\.
In another case a boy of fourteen year*
old was injured while operating a macnlna
in a cotton mill. The machine was not
dangerous, and so no special instruction,
so the court said, concerning the manner
of using it was required. Furthermore, it
was clearly shown that he had sought and
received all the instructions needful to
quality him for the position he held.
A Tin- Stamping' Case.
One more application of this rulÂ© may bÂ«
mentioned. A boy fourteen years old,
who was not familiar with machinery,
wa3 put at work by his employer at a tin
stamping machine. He sat at a high
bench, put the piece of tin in Its place on
the machine with his right hand and then
pressed his foot on a lever which brought
down a heavy hammer on the tin. The
foreman, when setting the boy at work,
stamped a few pieces of tin to show htm
how to do the work. On the second day,
while the boy was stamping a piece of tin
it slipped out of its place. Ha leaned over
to put it in place, and as ha did so. hia
bench being shaky, he pressed his foot on,
the lever, which started the hammer, and
it came down on his fingers and crushed
them. He sued his employer, but failed to
recover anything, the Court of Review re
marking that "there was no danger in.
this particular machine that was not as
obvious to a boy of fourteen as to an
adult. He could see that if he placed his
hand under the stamp it would bo
crushed. If boys are not allowed to use.
machinery until they have become accus
tomed to its use it would be difficult for
them to learn any useful trade or occupa
tion by which to earn a livelihood."
"Working 1 an Engine.
An instructive case has been decided in
Ohio. A boy was Injured while in tee em
ploy of the Cleveland Rolling Mill Com
pany. His duty was to turn off and on
steam at a steam ensrine. To do this h*Â»
had to stand near a shaft which revolved
when the engine was in motion. At the
time of the accident a short belt was
hanging loose on the shaft, when caused
the Injury. The court remarked that
three different rules had been applied
to such cases. OnÂ© was that children
were bound to exercise the same degree
of care as adults: another wholly freed
small children from negligence: another
"that a child Js held to no greater care
than Is usually possessed by children of
the same age." For one, we fail to aee
anything very luminous in this rule, even
though it is supported by the great weight
of authority. What degree of care, if any.
must a child exercise, and what Instruc
tion, if any. must be fiven to him before
he begins his work? These are thÂ© ques
tions that require answer, and the rula
above mentioned does not throw much
light on them. The court, however, in
reviewing the case put forth, as we think
far more wisdom than Is contained in thÂ©
rule itself. "It may be safely laid down
as a general rule," says the court, "that
persons who employ children- to work with
or about dangerous machinery or In dan
gerous places should anticipate that they
will exercise only such Judgment, discre
tion and care an is usual among children
of the same age under similar circum
stances, and are bound to use due care
having regard to their aga and inexperi
ence, to protect them from the dangers in
cident to the situation in which they are
placed, and as a reasonable precaution In
the exercise of such care in that behalf
it is the duty of the employer to so
instruct puch employes concerning thÂ«
dangers connected with their employment
which from their youth and inexperience
they may not appreciate or comprehend
that they may, by the exercise of such
care as ought reasonably to be expected
of them, puar.l against and avoid injuries
arising therefrom." A rational rule, truly,
that may be properly applied in the cases
we have described.

Lord Fairfax of Cameron.
The really Telegraph prves some Inter
esting details as to Lord Fairfax, -whosa
death took place at his plantation. North
ampton, Prince George County, Md.â a
house 150 years old with an estate of som*
seven hundred acres attached to it. Lord
Fairfax, who was a direct descendant of
the great Parliamentary commander la
chief, though a peer of Scotland, was a
citizen of the United States. Though ha
did not. of course, assume the title, it was
not in any sense dormant, and its pas
sage through male heirs ever since tne
family have lived In America has been
well recognized. The title descends to tho
late Lord's eldest son, who is a elerk in
the Xew York banking-house of Brown
Brothers & Co. The fact* that this most
historic title belongs to an American is
a pleasant and picturesque illustration of

ered way when the woman made her wild
plunge, and it was due to Captain Jones'
luck that he was able to change the
course of the Piedmont in order to save
the woman's life.
The tugboat Rescue came along Just
as the Piedmont was reversing her en
gines. Some of the deckhands on the
tug made a grab at the woman, but
failed to catch her. . The back wash from
the vessel neany drowned her, how
ever, and she was more dead than alive
when pulled out of the water by the life
saving crew of the Piedmont.
As soon as the Piedmont docked t'le
woman was taken to the Harbor Hospital.
She would not give her name, but on
an envelope and also on a prescription
written by Dr. McCone was the name
Mrs. C. L. Dell.
The letter was addressed to "The Belle
vue Sanitarium. Polk and Jackson
streets." It began "My Dear Alice" and
was dated from Alameda, being signed
"Minnie." In the communication "Min
nie" spoke of "Alice's" mental troubles,
and wanted to know why Alice had re
fused to talk to her when she called at
the hospital a week ago.
Dr. McCone refused to talk about the
case. He said Mrs. Dell's mind was un
balanced and that she should be locked
up in an asylum. He referred all who
wanted information to L. M. Hoefler, the
attorney.
When spoken to over the phone Mr.
Hoefler said Mrs. Dell had been sick for
a long time; that her husband was for
merly agent for the Atlantic and Pacifle.
and was later an employe of the Soutn
ern Pacific. During the strike of the
trainmen about eight years ago he went
crazy and has since been confined in
N'apa. His wife has been cared for by
friends, and, Judging from appearances,
she has not been neglected. Everything
the woman wore was of the neatest and
the best, Â¦while the change of clothing
she carried with her when leaving the
hospital was as good. Everything she
had at the sanitarium she took along
with her. and her alarm clock was still
ticking at 5:30 p. in. She had not a
cent In her purse Â¦when picked up, but a
kind-hearted passenger gave Captain
Jones $5 with which to provide for the
would-be suicide.
"The woman is suffering from some
nervous disorder," said Dr. Starr yes
terday evening, "and should be re
strained. From her condition I do not
wonder that she . Jumped overboard.
People in her state of mind are likely
to do anything, and I suppose the sight
of the Â¦water and the movement of the
ship caused her to lump Into the bay."
Mrs. Dell is as silent as a sphinx. As
to how. she feels or whether she wants
anything she will answer readily, but
when It comes to asking anything about
her own personal affairs she will not
speak.

Police Court Notes.
The body of an unknown man with the
throat cut was found early yesterday
morning lying in the surf at the Junction
of Taylor and Beach streets by John Pas
quoletl and H. Hoffman. The man's
coat was found floating In the water
close at hand. The body was taken to
the Morgue and searched, but nothing
was discovered that would tend to Iden
tify it. He was about 33 years old, 5 feet
S inches tall, light complexion, light blue
eyes, small reddish mustache and brown
hair. The clothing was a dark cheviot
suit, white shirt, laced shoes and gray
underwear. In the pockets were a shav
ing brush, a razor strop, a small hone for
penknives, a stamp pouch containing two
opium capsules softened by the action ot
the salt water, a white cotton handker
chief, a red bandana and a strip of white
cotton torn from the lower part of a
shirt. The body had not been In the
water more than ten or twelve hours.
Chief of Police Sullivan detailed De
tective T. B. Gibson to Investigate the
case and ascertain the identity of the
dead man. When the tide went out the
detective found partly buried in the sand
near the point where the body had laid
a. butcherknife and a whetstone. The
blade of the knife was as Bharp as that
of a razor, and It was no doubt the wea
pon with which the unfortunate man had
killed himself.

The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
at the semi-monthly meeting held last
evening took the first step In the> much
desired affiliation of the organization with
the many independent scientific societies
in this city. By a -jnanlmous vote the
offer of the Pacific Philatelic Society to
donate its valuable'- collection to the li
brary was' accepted, the condition that
the twenty-five members . of the society
be accepted as members of the library
also being granted. ,
Librarian Teggart thus sees the ulti
mate success of a plan he has long cher
ished, and similar steps will soon be taker,
by the library to secure the affiliation, of
the Medical. Geographical. Technical and
other societies. Vice President Kendrick
and Trustees Beanston, Brunt, Healy; Mc-
Laren, Neal, Taussig, Wallis. Wilson and
Cosgrave all spoke in favor of the affilia
tion, which, will increase the membership
of the library and at the same time add
to the collection of volumes.
Trustee Healy caused a slight stir in
the harmony of the meeting by introduc
ing a resolution that the trusteeship of
Louis Risdon Mead be declared invalid,
on the ground that when elected last
February,' Mead was not a resident of this
city, as required by the constitution.
For several months there has existed
considerable feeling between Trustees
Healy and Mead as to the election of Li
brarian Teggart. -The trustees last even
ing did not feel like ousting Mr. Mead,
and the matter .: was finally sent to the
finance committee and the vice president
to adjudicate. :Â¦-.-':
Secretary Cumming submitted his quar
terly report ending November 30. which
showed receipts as follows: Library.

on hand at the beginning of the quarter.

ion, $2522 93: ' Folsom-street grounds.
$1920 34; total, $12,838 35. Deficit. $305 20.
Librarian Teggart's quarterly report
showed that during the three months end
ing November 30. 1S2 new members had
Joined; 2196 new books and periodicals had
been received; 30,024 volumes had been is
sued for home use, and 3776 members were
in good standing.
Owing to the practice of members filinir
written requests for new books before
the- volumes had been received at the li
brary and In order to avoid friction, the
trustees decided that in future no writ
ten request for a book would be received
until the book required had been In thu
library for sixty days.
A new design was adopted for use -as
a bookleaf label and the trustees also in â¢
dorsed two resolutions received from the
California Clubâ one asking the next Leg
islature to take steps for the protection
of the'meadowlark. another asking the
Federal Government to foster a payinj?
forest industry similar to the one in
vogue in Germany:
The offer of two printing houses to
print the -monthly catalogue gratis, on
condition that they be allowed to secure
advertising in the same, was sent to the
printing committee for consideration. The
board also favored the report of the li
brarian as to the formation of an 'absent
rhiembershlp list and the extension of a
country membership, Wells-Fargro Com
pany promising low rates on all ship
ments of books.

What thin folks need Is flesh or muscle,
not lÂ»t.
To t>* symmetrical and properly propor-
tioned every person should have a certain
amount of excess flesh, but to be plump
coes not necessarily mean to be fat.
Fat Is undesirable: it clogs and retards
the action of the muscles, interferes with
Â»he healthy action of the heart and lungs
a.c3 when very excessive, predisposes too
:auy tfegentration of vital organs, to say
r.athing cf the <iiscomfort resulting from
too much adipose tissue.
Common stnse would suggest that if one
tylshes to t**come fleshy and plump the
tblns most needed would be flesh forming
foodâ ;hat is. albuminous foods like eggs,
beef, catmeal, etc.
The kinds of food wfclch make flesh are
the foods we have on our tables every
<!ay; but the trouble is that our stomachs
from weakness or derangement of some
kind do net promptly and properly digest
Really, the principal reason so many peo-
ple remain thin is because their stomachs
co not proptrly and completely digest and
tssimilate the Sesh forming beefsteak and
c-ggrs we eat every day.
There ar*Â» thousands of such people, and
they are really dyspeptics, although they
may net suffer any particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
If such rersons 2nd all thin people
would take after their meals some simple
nr.d natural dis^Â«rive, like Stuart's Ijys-
r*-psia TaMets. the food would be quickly
t i^csted and the proper degree of p'.ump-
i e* f^ \iry s?ocn result because these tab-
irtB s.T<r prepared exact'.y for that purpose.
ThÂ«-y cipest < very variety of flesh forming
food, which Is the real reason why they
eo quickly build up and strengthen thin,
dr*pepttc rnen and women.
gtuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure every
form cf indipestion on this common-sense
r.l*n. that they thoroughly digest the food
promptly, giving strength to every nerve
end orgpn in the body, and the weakened
etomach a chance to rest and recover its
r.Rivjrcl v^sror. Nothing- further is required
to cure any stomach trouble, except can-
cer cf the Ftcmach. They make thin, dys-
TTtic peoplf strong, plump and well.

LOCAL MARKETS,
NEW TORK. Dee. 18.â Procrastination was
the order of the day in the cotton nlarket.
Early fluctuations were tolerably energetic and
of generous scope, but business could at no time
be called active, and after the first hour was
very dull. The room element appeared to be
content to await the passage of the holidays
before making extensive fresh ventures.

freely to-day. This was of eoorse thÂ« out
come of the monetary situation In London.
With further military reverses In South Africa,
and the foreign exchanges running against her
it Is the common expectation that the Bank of
England discount rate will be advanced to
morrow. Such a condition Is always sufficient
to cause liquidation of foreign securities from
London in the interest of the money market.
No uneasiness is apparent over the money
market outlook so far as the immediate future
is concerned. The sub-treasury Is contribut
ing to the market by reason of large pension
payments, increased premiums on Government
bonds, which axe being rushed In for conver
sion Into the 2s before the refunding period
expires, and some payments on assay office
checks for gold deposited at Paciflo Coast
points. While these conditions make for the
safety of the money market the possibility Is
recognized of a pinch in the last week of the
year, especially If . undue speculati%*e commit
ments are allowed' to eat up the resources of
the. market. These various conditions are the
explanation of the exceedingly varied market
tor stocks. Heavy selling to take profits con
tinued side by side with extraordinary ad
vances in special stocks. Of the day's.special
movements by far the most Impressive was
the advance In the Erie stocks, the common
rising to 24 1 4, the first preferred to 67H and
the second preferred to 39%. There wu some
wide movements among the minor Vander
bilts and connecting lines in Central traffic
territory- There was an active upward move
rrent In the eteel group, in Sugar, Amalga
mated Copper. Missouri Paciflo and the South
ern Railway stocks, but none of these was
well sustained. The market closed furiously
active and surprisingly steady considering the
large volume of dealings.
The bond market was as varied and irregular
as that in Mocks and therefore realizing at
seme points contrasted with an advance in
price at others. Total sales, par value. $4,125.

California Weather and Crops.
A. G^ McAdie. section director of the climate
and crnp section of the Weather Bureau, makes
the following report for the week:
"The weather has continued cold and foggy
in the central and northern portions of the
Ftate during the greater part of the week,
and generally warm and dry in the southern
portion. Frofte have occurred in nearly all
sections, but were too light to cause damage.
Rain has fallen in all sections except Southern
California, the precipitation having been light
in the southern districts and heavy in the
central and northern portions. The storm of
the lith was accompanied by unusually high
winds, thunder and lightning, and by hall In
pome places. Some damage was done to fruit
trees, through breaking of the branches, and
blueings and fences were wrecked by the
Â¦n-ind in many places. The rain U considered
generally beneficial, however, and especially in
the southern counties. Farm work has been
retarded by the unfavorable conditions, but
will be resumed with fair weather.
Â¦"Early (own erain continues In good condi
tion, br.t has made rather Blow growth during
the week, and would now be benefited by eun
ehtne and warm weather, as the soil In many
places is cold and heavy. Green feed is abund
ant, but is growing slowly, owing to cool
weather. Proer>eets are still excellent for a
2&rre acreage of grain in all the grain growing
districts, although eome farmers fear a con
tinuance of present conditions will seriously In
terfere with craln planting. In lome parti of
Southern California farmers are preparing to
refume irrigation.
â¢'Citrus fruits have not been materially In
jured liy the storm, and In Southern California
are maturing rapidly. Somewhat cooler weath
er in that portion has checked the premature
budding of deciduous fruits. Olives arc in good
condition tad a large crop Is expected."

Features of French Elections.
There are sorae curious features con
nected with French Parliamentary elec
tions. For instance. â¢ no wall literature
issued by a candidate or his friends may
bo printed on white paperâ white being
the color reserved for official announce
ments. In the days of the empire, when
official candidates were known -in the
land, the addresses of the. Government's
nominees were printed . on - white paper,
and this, no doubt. hsCd due weight with
the more Ignorant voters. Again, any
elactor whose name - is â¢* mentioned in a
newspaper lean, if he feels himself ag
grieved, call upon the editor to publish a
reply. This, however, is not confined to
elections. " but is a . rigtot enjoyed by
French citizens Â¦ under tbe> UkW Â«i tiM

LAND COMMISSIONXE.
BENDERS OIL DECISION
Decides the Case of the Kern River
Company Against Clarke in
Favor of the Plaintiff.
WASHINGTON, Dec. IS.â The Commis
eoner of the General L&sd Office has ren
dered a decision in favor of the former in
the case of the. Kern River Oil Company
vs. W. S. Clarke, Clarke claimed title to
a forest reservation b;- virtue of two
separate selections.
The oil company protested that these
lands were mineral and claimed them un
der mineral locations made prior to the
date of these selections.
About the time these selections were
made It was represented to the Land Office
that the lands in this and a large number
of adjoining townships were solely valu
able for thHr petroleum deposits, for
which they had been located under the
mining laws and for which they were be
ing developed. The survey of the lands
over forty years ago made no reference
to minerals and returned the lands as ag
ricultural, and the opinion says the lands
remained unclaimed under the agricul
tural laws until after their location as
mineral. The commisMoner holds that
these claiming title to selections under the
act of June 4. I53T. have not done all they
are required to do 'until they have
filed proof required, made proof of tbe
publication of notice and the same has
been approved by the General Land
Offlce.

will net be settled. The temperance peo
ple declare they will keep up the fight at

FRENCH AMNESTY
BILL IS PASSED
Measure Extends to Offenses
During Strikes and
Public Meetings.
PARIS. Dec 13.â The Chamber of Depu
ties, af ten an all-night session, adopted
the amnesty bill by a vote of 155 to i
The benefits of tbe measure extend to
offenses connected with strikes, public
meetings of associations and the trouble
in Algeria In 1S37-3*. in addition to cases
arising out of the Dreyfus agitation.
During the discussion of the bill John
Lasce-s. anti-Semite Deputy for Condom,
called attention to a letter Â¦written by
Major CuiKTiet. who figured In the Drey
fus court-martial at Rennes, averting
that M. Delcasse. Minister of Foreign
Affairs, had told the Chamber an untruth
in the course of yesterday's debate when
he said that Major Culenet bad approved
the Interpretation piaced upon the famous
Panlrarai telegram.
"So far from this being the case." said
Major Culgnet in the letter referred to bv
M. Lasces. "M. Deicast^ even used
threats to get me to accept his views, but
the attempt was fruitless."
The Natior.sl!.=t pre?s made a great fur â¢}
yesterday ever Major Culgnet's open con
tradiction of the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, aad a momentous debate was ex
pected on the subject. M.. Delcasse,
however, pricked the bubble by declaring
that Major Cuignet was guilty of an un
truth In accusing him iM. Delcasse) of
putting pressure on him. He went on to
assert that Major Cuignet had never dl^
cu&sed the matter with him at all, and.
responding to Major Culgnet's charge thtt
the copy of the Panizardl telegram pre
sented to the Chamber was a forgery. M.
Delcasse announced that a document at
testir.g its authenticity existed bearing
the signatures of Major Cuignet. General
Chamoin and M. Paleologue. the Foreign
Office expert.
"The addition of a few fnsnlts." ex
claimed M. Delcasse. amid applause, "to
so many others, will not cause me to re
gret having doce my duty."

Senator Hanna gave a dinner to the mem
bers of the committee and there was gen
eral talk over tbe future of the organiza
tion as well as the incidents of the cam
paJ^n- Members of : the Â¦ committee, gen
erally believe that Congress and the ad
ministration should now, that the war is
over.- wipe out the war taxes entirely
and get back to bedrcck of revenue on a
peace basis. They bclieve-it would be a
better policy for: the Republican party
to wipe out , the whole war taxation by
one act than to go at It piecemeal, paring
here and there and trying to save more
than a half of this revenue for a sinking
fund, as advocated by Â¦ Secretary Gage.
The committee . is not .very . enthusiastic
in its support of. the policy of Secretary

were the results of the go at the Reliance
Club to-night bttween Tom Herman of
San Francisco and George BaXer of San
Jose. The San Francisco boy's aggres
siveness, though of little effect, was all
that saved him from losing the contest.
His leads, continuous and bard, were
blocked or dodged by his shifty antagon
ist so prettily that Bauer's stock
roÂ«e mightily in the eyes of the thousand
spectators
The San Jose man made a stay-away
fight, except in a few- round?, when he
used 'a straight left upon Herman's face
with such telling effect that the cham
plcn from over the bay became very tired.
Herman landed often on the body, but
the blows were not telling ones. Baker's
agility In getting away saved him from
mar.y a bard punch- /
The fight opened wish Herman fast and
strong, driving Baker around the rinsr.
The crowd thought It was too one-sided
for interest. But the second round
changed matters. Herman could not land
where his blows would count. In the
fourth round Baker sent some hot left*
and landed strong on the face. In the
ninth he repeated the performance. Tha
men kept at It moderately during the re
mainder of tbe go. with occasional stiff
blows from each side.
In the fifteenth Baker again used hi*
left heavily. But Herman was fighun?
hard when the bell rang. Judge* DewUi
Van Court and Cereni could - not agree,
and Referee Kitchings pronounced the
conteÂ«t a draw. _
In the first go Georpe Curran knocked
out "Kid" FInnerty in the fifth round.
Indian Joe Gregg and Charles Hawley
fought a ten-round draw.

The constitution was prepared and
adopted at a meeting of the executive
committee, which has fceen handling the
preparations for the conference that be
gins In this city next month. The execu
tive committee met in the building of the
Associated Cbarttes. several Sac Fran
ciscans ceing present. B. H, Pendleton
presided, and a draft of a constitution
was presented.
' It Is a very brief document, the pream
ble and qualifications for membership be
ing the principal points. In addition. It
provides for a presdent, two vice-presi
dents, a secretary and a treasurer, an
executive committee of five members, a
committee on time and place, which will
arrange for the annual conference, and
a committee on legislation, which will at
tend to bills that are to be drawn and
presented to the Legislature. All of these
officers will be chosen at the approaching
conference In this city.
Meanwhile the business is being con
ducted by the following committees: Ex
ecutiveâ B. H. Pendleton. P. E. Bowles,
J. p. Taylor. Dr. Susan J. Fenton. Kath
erine Felton and C. S. Greene, all of Oak
land. Legislationâ J. B. Richardson, Wil
liam Gorrill, Oscar Cushlng and J. P. Tay
lor cf Oakland aad Ossrood - Putnam of
San Francisco. Reception â Miss Ethel
Moore, who will appoint her own staff.
A bill was presented to the executive
committee last evening by J. B. Richard
son. the chairman of the legislation com
mittee. This 1411 was apcroved by the
executive committee and vrlll be submitted
to the conference for Its consideration.
The bill provides for a State Board of
Charities and Correction, whose position
will be purely advisory- There will be six
members, term* to be six years long, and
the first board to classify itself so that
two members will go out every two years.
The Governor Is to have the appointing
power, and he is to be ex-offldo a mem
ber of the commission. Women are eli
gible to membership, and not more than
three members are to be of the same
party. There Is to be no compensation
allowed the members except actual ex
pense*, and the total expenses of the com
mission must not exceed J4.C00 a year,
which Is to Include a secretary, who- Is
not to receive more than J1.K0 a year.
The failure of the members of the com
mission to attend three meetings with
out excuse 4s to be considered a resigna
tion by the Governor.
Tne commission is to have the power to
examine all public charitable and correc
tional institutions In the State with the
express exception of insane asyiums. with
which the movers in this project do not
wish to Interfere. All pri\*ate institutions
receiving any public aid at all are also
to be subject to their Investigation. This
means all public jails. State prisons
county hospitals and almshouses. and all
private orphan asylums receiving any
public aid. The plans of all jails, alms
houses^ county hospitals, orphan asylums
and .buildings of a similar nature are to
be submitted to this- board before con
struction, for the adviee and criticism of
the board. The Governor is given power
to order inrestlratlons whenever he sees
fit. :.
The programme of the meeting has al
ready been announced. The only charge
is that Governor Gage will not be present
as was expected.

<Â»ugh is apparently ample excuse, offered
in a forgery case, for the absence of a
signature. J. S. Barnes, on trial for col
lecting fees for bogus applications for
life insurance policies, testified to-day in
his own 'defense that the application In
question was made out in J. S. Fuller's
name at the request of his wife, who had
the soliciting agent sign it for her, as she
was kneading bread at the time.
Barnes also offered the testimony of E-
Reudy, another agent, to the effect that
the insurance companies are in the habit
of accepting such applications.
HATTDS WEBE TOO TTTHL
OF DOUGH TO WRITE
Novel Explanation of Alleged For
gery Offered by Defendant
in Court.
OAKLAND. Dec. IS.â The' fact that an
AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 1?.â Channing B.
Barnes, the train-robber whose dead
body is reported to have been found In a
swamp near New Orleans, was reared in
Austin. His parents reside here, his
father, Charles W. Barnes, being a gro
cer. The widow of the younger Chan
ning, who was formerly a saleswoman
In St. Louis, arrived here a few weeks
ago and has since been stopping with her
husband's parents. She was informed of
the reported killing of her husband this
evening, and seemed not to be affected.
She does not credit the report that the
dead body is that of Chanriing. The
train-robber's father was also unaffected
by the news of his son's reported death.
He said: "I believe it is all a fake gotten
up by the detectives. It may be true,
however, but I can't believe it. I don't
think Channiner has been near New
Orleans. I believe he Is in Spain."
The father of Channing formerly held
a prominent position with the Western
Union at Cincinnati. He came to Austin
many years ago. The pon was well edu
cated, and was given the best of religious
training by his parents. He was a wild
youth but was never accused of criminal
acts until after he had left home. About
fifteen years ago he served In the Cali
fornia State penitentiary for a bold bank
robberyt and after his release he went to
Mexico, where he remained for some
time. He next took up his residence in
St. Louis, where he resided ' under the
guise of a commission merchant at the
time he and his brother, Charles W.
When the bodv, was discovered to-day,
it was found that Barnes had cut his
throat and had evidently just died. His
own watch and that of Conductor Kinna
brew were running. He had been wounded
in the back and left wrist. Registered let
ters and dynamite were found on the
body.
NEW ORLEANS. Dec. IS. â Detec
tives to-day found the body of one of the
robbers who on last Thursday night held
up, within the city limits of Xew Orleans,
the Chicago itall train on the Illinois Cen
tral Ral!road7"fehot Conductor Kinnabrew
and escaped with a number of registered
packages. The watch of Conductor Kin
nabrew, found on the dead "man, leaves -no
doubt of his Identity as the leader of the
gang who he'd up the train. , â
Shortly, after the hold-up on Thursday
nieht Officers .Daly and Lucich, while has
tening to the scene discovered two men
carrying a bag and walking rapidly be
tween the Illinois Central and Mississippi
Valley tracks. The officers halted the
men. but Instead of surrendering they
began to shoot. Both officers responded
and a lively fusillade followed. The men
finally dropped a United States mail
pouch and fled. Since then the detectives
have been carefully examining the swamp
rear the city. To-day their search was
rewarded with the finding of a body. Late
to-day the dead robber was identified as
Channing B. Barnts. alias John H. Nel
son, alias Jack Nelson. He was wanted
for holding up the Illinois Central train
near Wickliffe. Ky., last July and robbing
the safe of the American Express Com
pany. His brother, Charles W. Barnes,
and Richard Doyle were convicted for
this latter robbery and both are serving
sentences in the Kentucky State peniten
tiary. When the attempt was made to
arrest Channing Barnes in St. Louis, he
shot Chief Special Agent George Murray
and escaped.
Leader of the Gang- That Held Up
the Illinois Central Fast
Mail Train Last
Week.
Remains of Channing B.
Barnes Are Discovered
at New Orleans."
FIND THE BODY
OF TRAIN ROBBER
Chief Special Agrent George .Murray of
the â¢Illinois Central, who was shot and
wounded by Channing in St. Louis after
the robbery, spent several days here a
few weeks agro In search of Channins,
who was believed at that time to be In
Austin. If the remains of the dead rob
ber at New Orleans are positively Iden
tified as those, of Channing B. Barnes
they will be brought here for Interment.

W. D. 5AN3ORN. General AÂ«nuThe police were called out aboard the
ship tWtton yesterday about 6 p. m. to
quell a disturbance. The vessel, com-'
mended by Captain Davis, was from New
South Wales, and was loaded with coal.
She arrived in port at 11:45 yesterday
morning and dropped anchor off Black
Point. As soon as the vessel was safely
anchored fourteen of the crew deserted.
Four of the crew, Thomas Nolan, Ar
thur MIddleton. James Vunan and Roz
zeno Attllio remained with the ship. The
first three went Into the forecastle and
made themselves comfortable, while At
tilio roamed the deck. Late in the after
noon, he claims, he saw smoke issuing
from the forecastle, and rushed to the
doorway to. ascertain the cause. He said
he saw the straw mattresses on which the
men sleep piled up on the deck and on
fire. Just as he started to rush to stamp
out the flames. Vunan came at him
with a knife. He dodged and ran around
the crew's quarters until he was able to
reach a belaying pin. This he lifted and
brought down oi Vunan's head, putting
an end to the chase.
First Mate Green heard the disturb
ance and came forward and put a stop to
further battling:. He signaled ashore for
the police, and had the lot arrested,
charging them at the Harbor Police Sta
tion with, attempting to burn the ship.

CAVALRYMAN" BTTBNETT
KICKED BY A HORSE
In regard to the story that the Southern
Pacific and Santa 'Fe; may, enter into a
deal, by which the two roads wlllbe able
to secure more direct rail communication
between Salt Lake" City and Los Angeles
Mr. Stubbs said - that he had heard the
report I but he ' doubted Â¦ if ' t herÂ« was any
truth in" it. The Southern Pacific, he said,'
has pretty good facilities for looking
after; both passenger and â¢ freight '. traffic
from these points. -although the communi
cation is not so direct as will be the new
Clark road, but the second vice president
did not think there was any, occasion for
immediate alarm or uneasiness. . Â¦ , .
' Mr.' Stubbs saw'Mariajrer'J. A.' Fillmore
while East. He was suffering from a se
vere attack of' inflammatory, rheumatism.
From last accounts, however, Mr. Fill
more ; was convalescent : and t had started
for^the coast ; In' a-orivate car.. .Â¦ .
Mr. Stubbs says the postponement was
a great disappointment to the railroads,
as the case is one of considerable import
ance and it was desired to have it set
tled as soon as possible. One of the most
important points brought out at the hear
ing was the fact that ship companies We
now preparing to enter actively into the
carrying trade from New York to San
Francisco and that several big ships are
to-be added to the carrying facilities of
one of the lines now in existence.
This knowledge imparted to the : rail
road officials may lead to a rate war be
tween the- water carrying companies and
the railroads,- which* will of itself solve
the pending case of the St. Louis people.
The case is one: in which all the Jobbers
wish to. secure Pacific Coast business,
i ne contention of the St. Louis people Is
that Â¦ the rate given by the railroads to
the Pacific Â¦ Coast on carload lots is so
much lower, proportionately, than the
rates, for. less than carload lots as to
mean practical discrimination against the
Middle West Jobbers.
Mr.> Stubbs says the cue is one of the
most important that has ever come before
the Interstate Commission and it Involves
so much to the parties in interest that it
is estimated they * have expended $25,000
In putting It Â¦ to the commission. , â¢â¢-Â¦
Besides Mr.- Stubbs,- the- Southern Paci
fic was represented at the hearing by
.William P. Herrln/'E.: S. Plllsbury rep
resented the Jobbers of this city and
Wakefleld Baker of Baker & Hamilton
was also present"? '
Mr. Stubbs went East to attend a hear
ing at Washington of the Interstate Com
merce Commission in the case which the
St. Louis Merchants' Association brought
against the different railroads which car
ry freight to the Pacific Coast from points
east of the Missouri and Mississippi riv
ers. Only three witnesses Â¦were examined,
and owing to the failure to subpena a
number of other witnesses, whose testi
mony was desired by the St. Louis par
ties, further hearing was postponed until
April 15 In "Washington.
J. C. Stubbs, vice Â¦ president of the
Southern Pacific, returned last evening
the East, where he has been since
the latter part of November. He attend
ed a meeting of railroad presidents in
New York and there , met Charles M.
Hays, the new head of the Southern Pa
cific, for the first time. It was thought
Mr. Hays might come back with Mr.
Stubbs, but Mr. Stubbs said last evening
that the ex-Grand Trunk manager had
decided not to leave Canada until the first
of the new year. â¢ -

Seriously Scalded.
Ar.gelo Esola is lying at the Receiving
Hospital suffering from a series of burns
and scalds about the upper portion of his
body, which will probably result in his
dfath. Esola left his wife and two young
children Jn New York and came to the
coast to secure employment. He secured
a. position with the Pacific Sheet Metal
Work? at Seventh and Townsend streets.
He was repairing a steam elevator when
the steam pipe burst and before compan
ions could rescue him he was badly scald
ed. The doctors have little hope of his re
covery. Esola lived at 754 Brannan street.
days ago he wrote from the Union League
Club to the firm that he was willing to
pay the $75, but would refuse to pay the
costs of the suit. He was waiting an an
swer to that letter when he was arrested
at the Palace Hotel by Detective Ross
Whlttaker.
"I feel most humiliated," said Brown
yesterday, "at being locked up in prison,
as there is absolutely no case against me.
I received a dispatch to-day from Fred
Quirk, a friend, that the firm in Oswego
was willing to withdraw the warrant on
payment of $130. I wired that I would
agree, as I do not want my father, who
is a retired ; merchant in New York, to
know that I was in prison, as he might
imagine I had been guilty of some crime.
At all events I have instructed my attor
ney to apply for a writ of habeas corpus
for my release to-morrow morning."
The only way in which Scott may suc
ceed in reappointing nearly all of the
twelve incumbents is to have the commis
sion certify to him the names of three
ellgibles for Â¦ each position. This would
bring sixty-nine names to him for appro
val. But If the commission does Â¦ not
countenance this plan and civil service
is strictly adhered to he will be unable
under any circumstances to retain the
eleven who did not pass.
Deputy Tax Collector Salomon was
thunderstruck when, he discovered that
only three of the present office force were
sulilclently high up on the list to be liable
for appointment- . -\
"Some of. the. best .men. In our, office
have failed," said Salomon, "and others
are so far down on the list that it looks
dubious for -them. >â¢ It Is â¢ Incomprehensi
ble. Why Mrs. Graff,,. who Is one. of our

The announcement of the eligible list
of experienced clerks in the Tax Col
lector's office was made yesterday by
the Civil Service Commission, and as a
result eighteen or twenty clerks at pres
ent employed in the office may lose their
positions because their names do not ap
pear high enough on the list or do not
appear at all. The Tax Collector will be
required to make a requislton for
twenty-three clerks, and according to the
rules of the commission the names
of the first twenty - five will be
certified, from which the selections
will be made. Only three of the
clerks now employed in the office are
among these twenty-five â Claire Knerr,
Frank Smith and Rudolph Albora. It Is
barely possible that Edward Harrington,
who stands number 26, and â¢ George Mc-
Calvy, No. 29, both incumbent clerks, may
slip -in among the' chosen ones in; case
four of those preceding them decline ap
pointment; but the others now In the
office are too far down on. the list to hope
for Immediate appointment. They are
John Boyle, Nicholas Martinovich, Hiram
Goldstein, Morris Schwartz, Julea Vols
onet, Thomas Brophy and Henry D.
Byrne. The other eleven employed failed
to get on the eligible list at all, and one
of these, Meyer Cohen, declined to finish
his examination. â¢ .

MANY CLERKS
TO LOSE PLACES
ANDREW WHITE BROWN, the
son of a retired millionaire mer
chant of New York, does not like
his detention in the City Prison,
and to-day, through his attorney,
T. D. RIordan, will apply for a writ of
habeas corpus for his release. Yesterday
Captain Seymour received a dispatch
from Deputy Sheriff C. S. Murphy of Ful
ton, N. Y., asking him to hold Brown and
saying that he would send after him.
Brown says that his arrest on the
charge of grand larceny Is nothing but an
attempt at blackmail. He purchased arti
cles valued at $75 from Jules Wendel &
Son, Oswego, N. Y., and they dunned him
for the money, finally bringing suit
against him and obtaining Judgment by
default. When he arrived here about ten
YOUNG MAN, WHO AFTER BEJNG PLACED IN "TANKS' ON A TEL
EGRAPHED CHARGE OF GRAND LARCENY. IS FOUND TO BE THE
SON OF A NEW YORK MILLIONAIRE.
Mr. Prather was then notified and he
regretted the loss of his pet. He had
captured the deer when it was in. its
"swaddling clothes" and had raised it on
his ranch. As It grew the animal was
given the privilege of the front parlor and
he behaved like a deer. He would play
fully wrestle with Mr. Prather*s guests
and managed to win many a bout. As he
grew the deer became impressed with his
prowess and was not afraid to tackle
anything on the place. This feeling led
to his untimely end.
Mr. Vogelsang thinks that thÂ© "high
horned" proceedings of the deer led to
the "passing of the buck;" yet, as a State
officer, he believes that the animal should
not have been killed during the close sea
son and, therefore, the citizens of Mon
tague are liable to imprisonment and fine
The deer was the property of Thomas
Prather. president of the Union National
Bank of Oakland. It was a pet and was
allowed to roam over the country home
of the Oakland banker, until he outgrew
his playfulness and proceeded to drive
every one off the land. He was impris
oned in a paddock and some time last
week broke through the barrier and not
finding a man or child that he could butt,
ambled down to the railroad station. An
overland train, crowded with Eastern vis
itors, had just pulled into the station and
a number of passengers alighted to
stretch their legs. The deer astounded
them by trotting toward the Pullman and
without warning bowling over a pas
senger. One or two other Easterners suf
fered alike fate and visions of the "Woolly
West" began to rise in the minds of the
frightened people who pressed their faces
to the windows watching the antics of
the deer. The rtation agent at Montague
rushed to the rescue and was unceremoni
ously greeted. He was, however, rein
forced by other residents and they vali
antly charged the brute. As soon as the
buck was thrown, its throat was cut ajid
it bled to death.
From the evidence in the hands of Mr.
Vogelsang, the citizens of Montague,
whose names are withheld at this time-by
him, committed a grave offense when they
killed the deer. On the other hand, the
parties ; under the ban claim they were
justified in ending the life of the pronged
animal and In their own defense set up
the following facts:
A number of good citizens of Montague,
Sisklyou Counry, are in grave danger of
being prosecuted for killing deer during
the close season. Chief Deputy John P.
Babcock of the Fish Commission has been
in consultation with Alexander T. Vogel
sang, who is~ a lawyer as well as a mem
ber of the board, and the latter has ad
vised Mr. Babccck to take no action un
til he. has consulted the law. and his fel
low commissioners.
