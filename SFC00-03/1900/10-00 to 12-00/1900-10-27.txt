he caused much laughter when he told of
the "danger of eighty-six one-hundreÂ«Uhs
of a mar; t0 every thousand of our popu
lation."
Governor Roosevelt began his address
by faying he was proud to be on the plat
form with Secretary Fairchild, for he
said:
"Wherever I have been in this cam
paign I have had with me man after man, j
v ho, though a life-long Democrat, de- j
clined to follow his party when that party j
fell under the leadership that was false
to all the earlier traditions of the party; ;
when that party fell under leadership I
that sought to lead it into the path of
national dishonor at home and abroad,
and old soldiers like General Brags; of
V'isconsin, gallant Dan Sickles and Franz
Siegel here in New York and their no less
gallant opponents who wore the gray, like
General Buckner and General Basil Duke,
left It because the Spanish war stamped
out the last lingering vestige of division
In this country and left us in fact as in
name a reunited nation. And the valiant
men who wore the blue and the no less
valiant men who wore the gray naturally
corae with us when we stand for the hon
es.ty of our people at home and against
the degradation of the flag abroad."
On the subject of Mr. Bryan and Mr.
Croker the Governor said:
"Mr. Bryan comes to this State as the
guest of Mr. Croker. Mr. Bryan comes to
this State pleading loyalty to the mem
ory of Jefferson and associating with Mr.
CroUer. Jefferson's statement was that
the whole art of government consisted in
being honest. Mr. Croker's gloss upon
that statement is that he is in politics for
his pocket every time. I am not slan
dering Mr. Croker; I am merely quoting
him. In Andrew* Jackson's day Democ
racy spelled hard money, expansion and
the honor of the flag. And who have the
right to report and remember Jackson
now? The men who stand for the dishonor
of the flag, lor the debasement of the cux
iency, for contraction of its national lim
its? No. The party that stands for an
honest dollar; the party that stands' for
keeping the flag hoisted in the Philip
pines, as it shall be."
Governor Roosevelt then plunged into
the issues of the campaign, starting out
with free sliver and following the lines
of his many addresses on this subject.
He then touched the present prosper
ity of the country and how Mr. Bryan's
prophecies regarding the gold standard
had turned out to be wrong and con
demning him for raising a feeling of envy
In the minds of the working class against
the capitalists. On this point he said:
"No greater evil, my fellow-countrymen,
can be done in this nation of ours than to
teach any group of Americans that their
attitude should be one of sullen hatred
and distrust to their fellows. That teach
ing means to nullify the work of a cen
tury and a quarter of statesmen who have
built up their works here. Before our
time there had been so-called republics in
which the rich oppressed the poor; there
bad been so-called republics in which the
people had plundered the rich. It has
been our boast that in this great repub
lic each man stands on his rights as a
man, demanding no more than his lights
and being refused no chance to receive
his rights." â¢ â¢
GHOST OF IMPEBIALISM.
On imperialism the Governor said:
"Our opponents talk of the dangers of
Imperialism. There Is but one danger to
free institutions in this country and that
would be by the general prevalence of the
doctrines, the seeds of which 'Mr." Bryan
has been sowing. Only in that way will
there ever be a chance of losing the lib
erty that we have inherited from those
who went before us. And now, Mr. Bryan
asks us to give up prosperity, he asks
us to dishonor the flag, he asks us to give
up our orderly liberty under the law,. for
what? For the sake of the most shadowy
ghost that ever was raised to frighten
political childrenâ the ghost of imperial-
Ism.
"Here in this building a week ago Mr.
Bryan repeated 'what he either knows or
ought to know to be an absolute slander,
when he ' said : that" our little army had
been created with the purpose of putting

Senators Bard and Perkins Decide to Voice
Their Views on .the San Francisco

SANTA ANA, Oct. 26.â When Senators Perkins and Bard . arranged in San
Francisco to meet In Southern California it was understood by both that they
would here settle the question of the Collectorshlp of the Port of San Fran
cisco. . .
Indications are that some prominent business man of S*n : Francisco who
Is not at the present time In the Federal service will be recommended to 1 the
President. .
Senator Bard said this evening to a Call representative: "The matter of
the Indorsement of a candidate for Collector of . the Port of San Francisco
has not been decided upon by. Senator Perkins and myself; neither has It been
mentioned In any manner for some tl^mc. I feel sure, however, that' Senator
Perkins will bring the matter up to T morrow, or next day at the furthest,
when, I presume, a decision will be arrived at." .-\
Â¦m -m EW YORK. Oct. 26.â The South-
H^fewj era Pacific Conmany's financiers
| have at length found a president
â¢ for their corporation. Charles M.
Hays, general manager of the Grand
Trunk Railway, Is their choice, and will
be formally elected to succeed the late
Collis P. Huntlngton by the board of di
rectors next week. Like his predecessor.
Mr. Hays has risen to this Important po
sition through his own capacity and grit.
The former came into the world the son
of an itinerant tinker, and from a farm
hand -and a country peddler became a
railroad king of thf New World. The lat
ter, has' fought his "way upward in the
railroad service only by the same execu
tive power and willingness to keep hard
at work, which carried both men to suc
cess," and Mr. Hays is a young man yet.
He leaves a most prominent position in
the' railway world of Canada to accept
Mr. Huntington's vacant chair. As gen
eral manager of the Grand Trunk hia du
ties have been those that fall upon the
shoulders 'of the president in the service
"I knew from the circumstances of. the
cheering at the time that there were some
Democrats there. I have confidence in
those people who fight when the country
needs fighters and who go back to work
and work when the country needs work
ers. I believe that we can rely upon the
citizen soldier, that we do not want or
need a great standing army, and if the

There were evidently a number of the
ex-soldiers In â¢ thai crdwd; jmd they, ajrain

in Florida. " . . \ ;..-/; ,--. â¢;;'Â¦Â¦ *:
"I had never learned to love the volun
teer, but I learned to love him when I
came in contact with him in the Spanish
war. I believe that this nation can rest
upon the volunteers. I found down in
Florida a regiment from this State. I got
acquainted with- the New 'Jersey boys at
that- time, and I believe you had a com
pany from this town. I remember them
because whenever I went into their camp

teers to the Cuban war, and said In this
connection:
- .While the local officials. of the Southern
Pacific have not as yet. received any con
firmation of the report.' still they take It
for granted that the uwt Is correct and
Vice President Stiibbs was frank to admit
that" he had. suspected that lit. Hays
would be the choice of the committee for
several weeks past. â¢ .'
- "When. Mr. Hays was first mentioned
two or three weeks ago," said Mr." Stubbs.
"I made up my mind that he could have
the place if he wanted It. Notwithstand
ing all the speculation that has been rife
since the death of Mr. Huntlngton. to
gether with the endless number of prob
able candidates who have been mentioned.
I think Mr. Hays Is the only man who
has been offered the position."
The selection of Hays is a popular
choice with local railroad officials. That
the selection has been made purely on the
strength of merit seems certain, as Hays
was no one man's candidate, nor was he
the chosen favorite Df any one or more
directors or bondholders -In the company.
It is stated that the selection of Hays
Is unanimous with the directors, so that
the confirmation of his name will be
merely a matter of course.
Mr. Hays' management of the Grand
Trunk Railway system has shown him to
be a believer in a liberal policy for plac
ing a road upon the very, highest plane of
perfection. He would spare no expense
to equip a road with every facility for
quick transportation. The department of
Improvements, extensions, etc., of the
Southern Pacific has always been oper
ated from the financial office of the com
pany In New York and the tendency haj
been to keep down the expenses of the
department. According to an official of
the company $1,000,000 or more could bÂ«
' advantageously expended In grading and
extension work, and there Is a strong
feeling that one of the first moves of the
'new president will be to make some radi
cal changes in the present policy of this
department.
With His Knowledge of Railroading
He Will Improve the Service.
Â¦ The first Information of Mb. Hays' se
lection . as president by the special com
mittee having the naming of Collls P.
Huntlngton' s successor was received in
this city about. 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon. The word was quickly passed along
the line and five minutes later it was the
all-absorbing topic in. the big 1 yellow
building oh Montgomery- street as well &a
in all the agency- offices along Market
street. . ' 'T Â¦*'
Chairman Charles H. Tweed of the
Southern Pacific directorate said to-day
that Mr. Hays would assume his new
work at the beginning of the new year,
with headquarters in San Francisco.
HATS IS A HARD WORKEE.
In this position his ability had of course
a broader scope. The Wabash, St.
Louis and Pacific had been In the
hands of a receiver since he had been
In its service. In 1S8D the system was spilt
up. That part of it comprising lines
west of thÂ« Mississippi became reorgan
ized into the Wabash Western Railway
Company, and the promoters of reorgani
zation had to choose a general manager.
Young Mr. Hays had attracted attention
by the capacity shown in helping to man'
age the old road, and the new place was
given to him. He proved thoroughly ca
pable of it, and two years later, when the
old system was reunited and the present
Wabash Railroad Company came Into
existence, he became its general manager.
On April 1. 1SS4. he left the Missouri
Pacific to become secretary to the gen
eral manager of the old Wabash, St.
Louis and Pacific road. Here his career
of rapid advancement really seemed to
set in. His application and grasp of rail
road problems won him golden opinions,
and a year and a half later, when only
in his thirtieth year, the cleric of com
paratively a brief time ago found him
self assistant general manager of the
road. Â¦*'.-â¢
he had barely attained his majority he
was made secretary to the general man
ager of the Missouri Pacific. There he
remained for about seven years. It was
an admirable post In which to get a thor
ough practical knowledge of railway man
agement.
â¢Â¦â¢'; Mr., Bryan* referred -to, the, .fact- that
Dover had supplied a company : of. ,volun-
Mr. Bryan expressed himself as highly
gratified with the Jer3ey campaign. Mr.
Bryan will make a brief run into Con
necticut to-morrow, speaking at New
Haven and Bridgeport; and will return to
participate in the meeting of the Demo
cratic clubs in New York City to-morrow
night. Mr. Bryan made the longest stop
of the day at Dover. He spoke at that
place for about an hour and addressed
a large crowd, which listened to him at
tentively. He. referred in this speech to
criticisms of himself tolthe effect that he
made charges for his campaign 'speeches.
On this subject he saul:
â¢ "According to the Republicans my farm
is not my only source of income. "They
say, that I am so avaricious that 'when I
am a candidate for President I will not
make a speech unless 1 am paid several
hundred dollars. They aJ so ' say, that I
am so ambitious that I would spend all I
have to be President. ; It is hard recon
cile the two' stories. II you are interested

have been able to muke a living 'under

I shall be able to make a*- better living

want to tell you that every dollar that 1
have made in the last four years has been
made out of the Voluntary payment by
people for what, they] bought and .wanted.
I published a book -and nobody bought it
unless he wanted to buy it. I have writ
ten articles for the newspapers. Nobody
read them unless lie wanted to. I have
delivered lectures and nobody came,un
less he wanted to come. Every dollar
that I made has been made. in that way.
But If I were the .attorney for a trust

the eyes of the Republicans...! need not

Mr. Bryan dwelt; at: some, length in his
Dover speech f on the trustquestlon and In
referring to the Standard Oil -Company said
that 'company, is; . through ; its 'power; as a

CANDIDATE BRYAN TALKS
OF TRUSTS AND THE ARMY
In One of His New Jersey Speeches the Nebras
kan Says He Learned to Love the Volunteer.
Governor Roosevelt's reception, in New York City last night aroused greater enthusiasm than
any previous event in the campaign. Features in the magnificent series of demonstrations were the speech
of the candidate for Vice President, the parade of 50,000 Republicans, the dazzling display of fireworks,
music by many bands and a chorus of 5OOO voices.
NEW YORK. Oct. 26.â This city ,
overflowed with Republican en
thusiasm to-night on the occa
sion of the reception arranged
for Governor Roosevelt, candi-
Cato of the party for Vice President. Be
ginning with the arrival at the Grand
Central station on the minute of the
schedule lime. 5:00 o'clock, until along
toward midnight, when the Rough Rider
Governor wer.t, tired and weary, to his
Bister's home for the night, there was
6uch a series of receptions, such a burn
leg of fireworks, such electrical displays
and such volleys of eloquence as are sel
dom seen in New York. It was the climax
of the candidate's tour of many thousands
of miles, and his friends and admirers
made the streets ring with their shouts of
welcome home.
The doors of Madison Square Garden
were opened to tlie public at 5 o'clock.
The big amphitheater was surrounded by
policemen, drawn up in single file on the
curb, while insidÂ» the building were scores #
of bluecoats.
, Outside the garden, waiting for the
f ppcnlJig of the doors, was an orderly
crowd. There was no rushing or con
fusion. Inside were two regimental bands,
one at each end of the garden. They con
tinually played, alternating daring the
three hours' wait. Popular airs were
played mostly and were loudly cheertd.
Frequently campaign songs were sung by
three <juartets.
The decorations weryprof use. the^ stars
and stripes predominating. The speakers'
t-tand was draped with bunting, and di
rectly beneath the front rail were the coat
of arms of the State. Serving a double
purpose of a decoration and a sounding
board were huge sheets of yellow and
white burning, which completely covered
the iron girders. In every seat was a
small American flag to which was
fastened a button of Governor Roosevelt
In his Rough Rider uniform. _ Mo?t of
the MÂ»Â«-o -were occupied by appointments.
The groups e,f paraders began to reach
the square soon after 8 o'clock and as
each contingent arrived there was more
cheerii:g and more burning of Greek fire
and rockets. There were some little ac
cidents caused by overanxious crowds
rushing from one attraction to another,
but nothing serious was reported in tnis
line.
Every invention in the pyrotechnic line
was utilized and come of the displays took
the crowd by storm. Great set pictures
of the "Full Dinner Pail" and representa
tions of President McKinley and Governor
Roosevelt were cheered vigorously. ThÂ©
Democratic inuto^cope on the Bartholdi
Hotel was at work all the time throwing
mottoes on the Dewey arch, on the clouds
and on the walls of the buildings around
the square, but he Republicans ignored it.
Another feature was the' playing of many
bands in unison, directed by a searchlight
and the va^t chorus singing.
One thousand policemen were on duty
about Madison Square and in the Garden.
They kept the crowd under perfect con
trol from the outside. A way was kept
open frcm the hotel up Fifth avenue to
Twenty-sixth street. The people were
kept back to the curb. Governor Roose
velt came out of the hotel at 7:50 o'clock
and got into his carriage. He was recog
nized M once, and until he got into the
Garden and for some minutes afterward
he was cheered and cheered. He stood
nearly all the way to the Garden and
bowed to the crowd.
PROLONGED APPLAUSE.
The Goi'ernor reached Madison Square
Garden at 7:5S o'clock. The cheering out-
Fide made this fact known to those within
and there were expectant cries of "Here
he comes!" The audience stood waving
flags and cheering when the Governor ap
peared. There was a gTeat tumult. Bands
were playing hard to make their music
heard, but except to those Immediately
alongside they might have kept silent, < .
The party went to the speakers' stand.
The Governor was followed by Senator
1'latt. When the Governor got to his
place on the front of the stand the aji
p!auÂ£e was deafening. General Francis
V. Greene, life chairman, tried to get or
dor. but the crowd cheered the louder.
The Governor stood quietly beside the
chairman. The applause lasted nine min
utes.
Genera! Greene introduced the Gover
nor as the strongest advocate of the ad
ministration's policy in the Philippines.
Another ovation followed as the Gover
i or raised his hand to command atten
tion. He began his address with the
word.-;. "My fellow Americans." He re
ferred to Mr. Bryan's %-lsit to the State
and th* reception prepared by Tammany
Hall, and the audience groaned and
"Good for you. TeflfljT soak it to 'cm'."
yelled a maii high up. Many like expres
sions came from other parts of the Gar
den. His reference to Mr. Croker's fam
ous remark about "Working for his own
rocket all the time" brought ftrth the
try. "You're all right, Teddy!"
Governor Roosevelt ridiculed Mr. Bry
an's attitude on every public question.
"Sal; into him; give him the mischief:"'
roared a man.
The audience kept up incessant cheer
ing. The famous baseball crank who Is
iknown as "Well, well" had a seat up-
Mairjs. and, of course, he was much in evi
dence.
BOOSEVEXT'S TELLING WORDS.
Â¦Worn the Governor took up militarism
"Ladles and gentlemen," he begun.
'.'This building seems to be filled with^a
new audience. Fellow Americans, I want
to say to you that 1 am gratified. I have
finished my speech.- I am, however, go
ing to bay just one more word. Mr. Bryan
is in doubt about the paramount issue.
I'll tell you what it Is. The paramount
Mr. Richards was interrupted by a club
of' 500" Rough Riders, who marched In
with a band at their head and bringing
with them a big crowd from the street,
all yelling for "Teddy." ' The Governor
was still on the platform and at last
arose and stepped to the edge. He held
up his hand for silence and In less than
a minute a pin might have been heard tc
drop. :Â¦ :^'-
GOVERNOR AGAIN TALKS.
The last address of the evening was de
livered by John K. Richard?, Solicitor
General of the United States.
Governor Hlack was followed by Senator
W.. P. Frye of Maine. His text was "The
Spanish Treaty and Its Results."
Former Governor Frank S. Black, the
next speaker, attacked the record of the
Democratic party regarding the colored
race and said that the hand that has de
graded the negro was now seeking to
stultify the constitution to protect the
Filipino savage.
B. B. Odell Jr., candidate for, Governor
of New York, followed Mr. Fairchild, ac
cusing Mr. Bryan of concealing the main
issue of the campaignâ the financial ques
tionâbehind expansion, imperialism, mili
tarism and trusts.
Partial order was secured, and he fin
ished with little applause, except* at the
close. A lot of young men from the Col
lege of the City of ' New York at this
point insisted on calling for three cheers
for Roosevelt, and the cheers were given
with much enthusiasm. .
Â¦ An exodus from the garden began at
the close of the Governor's- address. The
noise almost drowned Mr. Falrchlld's
voice. -He could not be heard fifty feet
distant.
OTHEB SPEAKERS APPEAR.
"It is not alone Republicans who deter
mine that no man of Bryan's character or
representing the disorder which he stands
for be President of the United States.
Thousands of Democrats who believe in
the maintenance of law and order. In hon
esty in llnance and in the Independence
of the judiciary will this year vote for
McKinley. For, however much they have
differed from Republicans In the past or
may differ from them in some issues now,
yet they see* their duty in the face of such
a disaster as the election of Mr. Bryan,
and they desire to make his defeat so
decisive that the menace to the business
of the country involved by Bryan'e recur
ring, candidacy may be forever removed.
No one is ' better qualified to j speak ' for
the sound money Democrats of this great
financial center than the Secretary of the
Treasury in Mr. Cleveland's first admin
istration." Â¦ .
After appealing to the audience to sup
port the Republican policy, Governor
Kocsevelt concluded by intrcylucing ex-
Senator Fairchild in the following words:
The Governor then referred to the at
titude of the soldier In the Spanish war,
eulogizing the volunteer as he has many
times in his speeches.
"Five years ag-o when I was Police
Commissioner â I understand that several
of my fellow citizens runember Uw factâ
when I was Police Commissioner I asked
for and obtained an increase of 2000 mem
bers of the force for the present borough
of Manhattan alone. I asked for and ob
tained without a word of protest or a
thought from any one that his liberties
were to be endangered a much larger
body cf men than would have been ob
tained now by giving the borough of Man
hattan its proportion of the re&Mar
army, and no human being has any right
to feel afraid of those soldiers unless he
Is also afraid of the police."
It in forts to overawe worklngmen of our
great cities. Gentlemen, there are 65,000
regular soldiers In the United States.

Ovation to Stevenson.
some respects the most notable of the day
and the street exhibition was exceptional.
He was conducted from the railway sta
tion to the courthouse in an open car
riage, a distance of a mile or more,
through the principal streets, and received
an ovation trom one end of the route to
the other. Most of the houses were dec
orated with flags and bunting and the
windows almost without exception were
tilled with women, who . vigorously flut
tered handkerchiefs and flags at the can
didate as he rode by. The crowd in the
street was very enthusiastic and when the
speaking took place Mr. Bryan encoun
tered a veritable ocean of human beings.
The crowd was so dense that he found it
extremely difficult to reach the stand, and
was so extensive that It was impossible
to make himself heard to the outskirts.
The speech at Paterson touched upon the
general issues of the campaign and- was
freely applauded as it progressed. ' He
talked on the trust question, but made no
reference to local conditions. In the
course of his discussion of the trust ques
tion Mr. Bryan said:
"You cannot afford to take away from
the man who tolls the prospect of pro
motion due to his own merit. When you
have a monopoly there and no necessity
for making the best article at the lowest
price, and you have a monopoly, you will
find you will get inferior goods at a
higher price. You will retard the ad
vancement that was marked in the prog
ress of the industries of this country. I
am not willing that such a system phall
stand, and therefore I will promise and do
promise that If Intrusted with the office
of the chief executive of the nation every
power that the President can command
will be used to make it Impossible for a
private monopoly to live in the United
States."
A epeech of three minutes was sched
uled for Belleville, between Paterson and
Newark, and a large number of people
were congregated at the railroad station.
The train, however, only stopped long
enough to permit the qrowd to look at the
candidate. Mr. Bryan arrived at Newark
a few minutes past 7 o'clock to-night and
here the scenes which. were witnessed ltÂ»
Jersey City last night were repeated on a
somewhat smaller scale. The streets
were thronged with people and the path
way of the Democratic standard-bearer
v:as illuminated with greek fire. He was
first driven to the residence of ex-Senator
James Smith, -where he took dinner. In
front of the Smith mansion a vast multi
tude of people were assembled and they
cheered heartily when Mr. Bryan and his
escort of committeemen and marching
clubs arrived at that point. The speeches
in this city -were made successively at
Rose Park. Kruger Auditorium and the
baseball grounds, the principal address
being that at the auditorium. The meet
ings wore all largely attended and ap
plause greeted him at every turn.

dred angry men, women and children as
sembled near the Cameron Colliery to
night and as the non-union workmen left
for home they were assailed by volleys of
cobblestones. Although all of thi
workmen had been sworn in as special
policemen and were armed, they did not
shoot into the mob, which was led by four
women carrying American flags. In es
corting Paul Kllnger, the breaker boss!
from the mine, his brother, Constable
Joseph Kllnger, fired one shot at a crow 1
on a bridge because they hurled rocks at
the pair as they traversed a railroad.
Following the shot, part of the mob
chased the brothers into the city limits.

taken down into the mines to-day. The
individual operators are also getting
things In shape for work again, although
as yet they have not posted the notices

NON-UNION MEN
.VALLEY FIELD, Quebec, Oct. 26.â The
evening passed off without the slightest
disturbance. Two hundred men belonging
to the Sixty-fifth Battalion arrived from
Montreal at 10 o'clock, bringing the num
ber of men on duty up to 600.
The soldiers were kept inside the mill
inclosure. The people are very anxious
that the troops should be withdrawn. A
meeting of the Council and 'Justices of
the Peace was held to-night and an un
derstanding was given that if. the troops
Â¦were withdrawn peace would, be pre
served. This will be accepted and, the
trouble will end without serious blood
shed. ?
Altthough the present trouble Is on ac
count of a refusal to meet the demand
for more pay for the men working on the
construction of a new mill, the strike has
all the appearance of assuming the old
position of race hatred, fuel being added
to the flames by the British soldiers. A
detachment of the Duke of York's Royal
Canadian Hussars (cavalry) Is under or
ders to proceed io VaJley Field to-day.
Only one striker was wounded last night.
He was shot in the arm and is not seri
ously injured. Four hundred more oper
atives joined the strikers this morning.
The town Is now under martial law.
. The Scots were at the mercy of the
strikers, as Colonel Ibbetson was unable
to find a magistrate who would read the
riot act. The officers j had to content
themselves with firing their revolvers into
the air. In the meantime the men were
the targets for fusillades of stones and
other missiles. The town is largely
French-Canadian and has. at all times
been a hotbed of race hatred, culminating
in trouble recently over the employment
of one Egan in the mills, where there are
some 4000 employes paid by English cap
ital.
MONTREAL, Oct. 26.â There are on
duty at Valley Field, guarding the exten
sive works of the Dominion Cotton Com
pany, twenty-flve officers and 358 non
commissioned officers and men of the
Royal Scots, Victoria Rifles and Garrison
Artillery, augmented by a bearer corps.
The Victoria Rifles have a" Maxim gun.
The sending of reinforcements * was de
cided on last night, after the first de
tachment of the Royal Scots had come
into collision with the strikers, resulting
In nine of their men being wounded.

Strikers and Troops Will
Be Withdrawn.
QUIET RESTORED
AT VALLEY FIELD
The text of the communication: handed
by the Chinese Minister to the Secretary
of State to-day is as follows: .
"A cablegram from Viceroy Chang Chi
Tung, dated October 25, states that the
Governor of Shensl has reported that
Kang . Yi died on October 18; : that -.. Yu
Hsien (lato Governor of Bhansl) has com
mitted suicide by swallowing, gold : leaf,
and Prince Tuan has not been permitted
to accompany the court.
There are certain phases of negotia
tions which, according to officials of the
administration, are not fit subjects of ar
bitration. They feel that it is desirable
to endeavor to arrange at the outset by
settlement with China through her Com
missioners and Ministers resident in Pe
king. The Ministers thoroughly under
stand th,e situation, and by reason of the
experience they underwent are qualified
to take immediate action. On the other
hand, officials say that The Hague court
would have to organize an investigating
commUtee, the labors of which would re
quire some time. Prompt action, which
officials nay alone can save China from
dismemberment, would not be possible by
a reference of the matters In dispute to
arbitration. On the other hand, those
who advocate arbitration say that more
expeditious action could be i secured by
reference of the entire dispute to arbitra
tion a^ this time than by awaiting nego
tlons which may be indefinitely prolonged
and which may produce no results. An
official- who discussed the suggestion to
arbitrate the enttre Chinese question Baid
to-day that In order to make arbitration
a success if would, of course, be necessary
for all powers to take part therein.
The United States eagerly assented to
the Russian suggestion for arbitration of
the indemnity question, for the reason
,that it opened the way out of the laby
rinth of complications. This -is. a feature
of the* negotiations which involves the
maintenance of the integrity of China.
The authorities are anxious to obtain In
formation relative to the replies of Ger
many and Great Britain on the Russian
suggestion. No information on this point
has yet reached the State Department.
Should all" nations assent, the authorities
say, the great obstacle In the way -of a
satisfactory solution of the whole Chinese
question will be removed.
There is reason to believe that the diplo
matic efforts of the administration are
now being devoted to obtaining a general
agreement from all the powers insuring
the maintenance of the integrity of the
Chinese and the preservation of the open
door. China's assent. to the demands of
the powers is a matter of course, so- that
the pressure this Government Is exerting
Is being exercised on European powers
whose policies have engendered suspicion.
Any doubt that China. Is acting In com
pliance with the wishes of the powers was
dissipated to-day by news communicated
by Minister Wu to Secretary. Hay, an
nouncing the suicide of Kang Tl and Yu
Hslen and the failure of Princes Tuan and
Chwang to accompany the Imperial court
to Shensl. The opinion is expressed -in
Chinese circles that Tuan and Chwang, to
avoid further disgrace, will kill them
selves.
A step in this direction has already been
taken by Secretary Hay. He has cabled
to. Minister Conger a suggestion made by
Russia, that in case of a protracted di-^
vergence of views on the question of In
demnity it be referred to The Hague
court for determination. Under instruc
tions given Minister Conger, he will con
sult with his colleagues on the question
of indemnity and discuss with them the
demands their governments will make In
this respect. Should he report that it is
not possible to reach an agreement. Sec
retary Hay proposes to earnestly advo
cate the adoption of the Russian sugges
tion as the easiest method of obtaining a
satisfactory solution. There is no doubt
that Secretary Hay and other officials of
the administration favor the observance
of the principle of arbitration, but they
believe it in> tne interest of all the powers
and China that direct negotiations should
first occur.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO

negotiations in Peking fail to produce sat
isfactory results within a reasonable time

railroad men, and the chairman of the
meeting was Lot Brown, agent . of the
Chicago. Burlington and Quincy Railroad.
Unbounded enthusiasm was manifested
throughout the speeches and a large

MUCH DEPENDS ON WEATHER.
Rain Might Change the Result af
Election in Many Localities.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â "We can't
predict what kind of weather will prevail
on election day," said Professor -Willis
Mocre, chief of the Weather Bureau. "It
is too far cff. The result of political elec
tions In a number of localities depends In
a great measure on conditions of th<*
weather. For instance, if it rains on the
days preceding the election and on elec
tion day itself in the Slates of New York,
Illinois. Indiana and Ohio, or any other
State which has large centers of popula
tion, the Democrats, as a rule, have been
EUccessful. If. on the other hand, the
Â¦weather is dry, the Republicans have car
ried the day.
The cause for this apparently pecullat
appearance can Â¦ very easily be ascer
tained. If it rains the country roads are
in bad condition and the farmer, who I;
mostly Republican and may be afflicted
with rheumatism and trouble- with car
buncle on his neck besides, will, rather
than jeopardize his health ana personal
comfort, sacrifice his vote. In cities,
where most of the Democrats live, cli
matic conditions do not affect the attend
ance at the polls to such an extent, and
the result Is that good weather is favor
able to Republicans and bad weather to
Democrats.

Chorus, at Madison Garden.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â Madison-square
Garden, over Its length and breadth, was
one mass of color in honor of the coming
to town of Governor Roosevelt. From
thortly after dark until late In the night
the tumult continued. /-
The fireworks display began at dark
and filled the air continuously for hours.
While the bombs burst scores of vari-col
ored balloons of paper -were sent aloft.
Thousands of persons watched the dis
play. The tower of the garden was Illu
minated with myriads of Incandescent
lights, while red, white and blue lights
blazed from the big building. Brilliant
fountains and showers of sparks were
cent off from all sides of the park.
The departure of the Governor and
party from the hotel was the signal for
one of the most brilliant displays of the
evening. While the display of fireworks
was at its height the big chorus of 5000
voices, led by Bandmaster George L.
Humphrey of the Seventh Regiment
Band, burst forth with the strains of
â¢The Star-Spangled Banner" in Madison
p<]uare Park, liandmaster Humphrey di
recting the chorus from the garden tower
by means of the searchlight there.
"America" was rendered by the chorus,
it also being directed in the same manner.
The music, like the fireworks, was re
ceived â¢with great appla*Â»e by the multi
tude, which thronged every available foot
of FiÂ»ace for blocks around Madison
square Garden. The score of bands,
turhlch had participated In the parade, also
swelled the volume of Found and added
to the din. While the speechmaking was
In progress at the garden and at the
elands throughout lhe>park the pyrotech
nic display was continued. As the big pa
rade progressed the fireworks were set
off. fining the air with screaming bombs
and Immense skyrockets. The search
lights in the garden tower played con
tinuously on the crowds which filled the
Ftre^tF, and sometimes, when some more
brilliant pieces were bfing Bet off, the
light was stronger than though the park
had been filled with arc lights.
The big set pieces, which displayed the
pictures of McKinley. Roosevelt. Wash
ington and Lincoln, were reserved for the
close. As they were eet off, one by one,
they won the admiration and applause of
the crowds. These pieces were all placed
at a corner of the park and the 'jam in
the vicinity of the Fifth-avenue Hotel,
tbe Hoffman House and the Demey arch
required a large force of police to keep
It from crowding out Into the street and
Interfering with the parade. It was a
good-natured crowd, however, and there
waÂ«> little or no trouble. It is estimated
that about 50,000 persons took part In the
parades. .
Eenator Hanna's Speeches.
CHICAGO. Oct. 26.â The Auditorium was
filled to-night with an. Immense audience
brought together to hear Senator Hanna
of Ohio and Senator Burrows of Mlchl-
Brilliant Pyrotechnics and a Great
FIREWORKS AND MUSIC.
A* early as Â» o'clock the crowds began
to gather at the Grand Central Station to
see Governor Koosevelt come borne. Many
of the men and women arrived in car
riages and the crowd to a great extent
was a well drt-ssed one. Police on foot tÂ»
the number of liM controlled the throng
and forty mounted ones acted as the Gov
ernor's bodyguard through the streets.
Some minutes before train time the re
ception committee arrived tit the station.
There was an open carriage for the Gov
ernor. In Â»t were General Francis V.
Greene and Secretary George R. Man
chester of the County Committee and Cor
nelius N. Bliss. In other carriages wur>
other party loaders.
When the Governor's train came in an
time one very demonstrative, well dressed
man broke tnrough the line and shouted,
"Just like Teddy. Right on Uie minute."
This was the signal for the crowd, which
broke into a great cheer. Mr Uliss was
nm to greet Governor Roosevelt. He
shook hands cordially and told the Gov
ernor he looked line.
"Thank you. I am in perfect health."
replied the Governor-
He rmiled and shook every member of
the committee by the hand. As he passed
along the platform he was kept bowing to
the crowd.
â¢"Hooray for Teddy. Three cheers for
tbe Governor. What's the matter with
the next Vice President?" were some cf
the things which made the Governor
smile.
At the end of the platform there was
a minute of delay and a number of women
insisted on shaking hands with the Gov
ernor. The party linally got Into the car
riages and away to Fifth avenue. The
crowd kept up cheering until the party
was out of view. The route was straight
doÂ«n the avenue to the hotel. The Gov
ernor was cheered all along the line, and
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel the scenes
about the station were largely repeated.
"BIGHT ON THE MINUTE."
Issue is to Bryanize the nation and
Crokerize the State."
At this point the Republican leaders and
others crowded into the garden. A dozen
bands were playing at one time, and Gov
ernor Roosevelt seemed to enjoy the con
fusion and uproar. When order was re-
Ftored, Governor Roosevelt resumed:
"Now. gtntlpmtn, in closing 1 am going
to ask that tach of. you ebow by his works
the faith that is within you. And now.
Â¦we shall close the speaking and see the
passage of these organizations. And. in
clofing. I am going to ask you to join with
me in three cheers for President McKinley
end Mr. Odell."
The chet-rs were given in a way that
made the walls of the garden vibrate.
When Governor Roosevelt had con
cluded. Mr. Richards made no further ef
fort to conclude his spet-ch.
While the meeting was in progress in
the frarden the speakers on all the fctands
addressed thousands. During the inter
missions the hands played ana the crowds
in a great chcrus sang ' the national
hymns, the time beaten by the great gar
den sparchlifiht.
When Governor Roosevelt came out of
the garden he drove to his hotel, and
thence to the residence of Douglas Rob
inson, his brother-in-law.

LONDON, Oct. 27.â It now appears thai
Jacobsdahl was not captured by the

""Later r.tfrs from Jaooosdahl shows
that 200 Boers un^uetessfully attacked the

CAPE TOWN. Oct. 26.â The Boers have
captured Jacobsdahl. southwest of Klm

the part of the parrlson, which consisted
of a detachment of Cape Town Highland
ers. The latter suffered severely, losing
thirty-four out of fifty-two men.
Hans Iiotha has cut off a train with i

eight men were wounded aisd all were
captured.
PARIS. Oct. 26.â Dr. Loyiis, Transvaal
agent, was questioned to-day' with refer
ence to the plans of former President
Kruger. He said:
â¢'Most of the stories published on the
subject are imaginary. M.\ Kxuger will
land at Marseilles and I shall go to meet
him. But it Is not true that 1 have seen
M. Delcaspe. the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, or that I arn in any way
arranging a reception, which will be en
tirely in the hands of the French â¢ them
selves. Nothing has been definitely de
cided as to the details of Kruger's stay
in Europe. But Mr. Kruger is an oid nwn
and not accustomed to a cold climate, so
it is likely he will sojourn in the neigh
borhood of Nice for the winter. 1 nave no
leason to believe there is any ground for
the statement that President Kruger in
tends to visit President McKinley."

WASHINGTON. Oct. 28.â A suit
for $50,000 damages for breach of
promise against United' States
Senator William V. Sullivan of
Mississippi was -filed in the Dis
trict of Columbia Supreme Court this
afternoon, by Mai Lucy Leeton of Oxford,
Miss. The plaintiff in her affidavit .alleges
that she, "an unmarried woman, at the
request of the defendant undertook and
promised to marry him and the defendant
undertook and promised to marry the
plaintiff, which he, without cause or right,
has refused to do." The plaintiff claims
that she met Senator Sullivan about Oc
tober 7, 1S95, In his law office at Oxford,
he being employed to defend her brother
in-law. She claims that he made protesta
tions of affection for her "and began by
wiles and- artifices to induce the pialntlrf
to accompany him on a journey to Chat
tanooga, Tenn." Plaintiff, claims.she"re
fused to go with him, but allowed him to
i correspond with her. Shq v.-us. at that
time married, but not living with her
husband. Plaintiff claims that Senator
Sullivan promised to procure a divorce
for her, "and that he- would'keep her for
ever with him and that she should occupy
as high a position as any lady in tne
land."
About December 1, 1S95, the plaintiff, at
the request of the defendant, went with
him to New Orleans. In January, â¢ 1S36,
according to the affidavit riled to-day, the
defendant placed plaintiff In Nelson's
Business College at Memphis Tenn., pay
ing her tuition and board. In May,\ 1S97 '
he secured a divorce for her. The afll
davit then alleges that on May 10 of that
year plaintiff and defendant lived to
gether in Alexandria, Va., as Mr. and
Mrs. W. L. Sutton, he introducing plain
tiff as his wife. Later he placed her in
the Fauquler female institution In War
renton, Va., as his niece, where she re
mained from January to June, 1898, the de
fendant writing her every day and prom
ising her he would marry her in the sum
mer.
During this time plaintiff claimed she
had an offer of marriage from a young
man who lived near her home and asked
the defendant to consent to- break oil
their relations. The latter, she claims,
urged that she should not marry the
young man. but wait and marry him the
following summer. The affidavit recites
that the couple lived together in Wash*
: ington and that the defendant finally no
tlfled plaintiff that he was not financially
able to marry her. Also that plaintiff,
hearing defendant was ill, in June, 1900,
came to Washington to see him and
found him rooming with "a woman whom
he had brought from Holly Springs,
Miss. She claims the defendant offered
her J1000 to go home and not expose him
before the said woman. The plaintiff re
fused to do this and claims that the de
fendant abused her and left her without
money, friends or means to live on.
The court this afternoon issued thÂ«
usual writ for service on the defendant
to show cause within twenty days of
service why judgment should not be had.
The writ is in the hands of the Marshal
for this district for service. Senator Sul

MAY ESTABLISH A BRASS
FACTORY ON THE COAST
Re-election of McKinley Will Mean Branch
ing Out of a Bay State Firm.
Guyler K. Sanborn. vice president of the
Haydenville company, which owns one of
the largest brass and iron foundries in
the United States, is at the Palace for a
few days. Mr. Sanborn has been a regu
lar visitor to the coast every fall for the
past six years and he says this year beats
the record for prosperity.
"Our firm has been molding brass for
thirty years," said he. "and never nave
we been so crowded with orders as at the
present time." â¢
The company's foundries are located at
Northampton. Mass. Should President
McKinley be re-elected the company has
in mind the establishment of branch fac
tories in Ohio and on the Pacific Coast,
possibly in this city. A plant has already
been put in readiness at Loralne. Ohio,
and it will be started up the 1st of Janu
ary with a big force of men.
Mr. Sanborn has talked with prominent
San Francisco business men relative to
erecting a plant here and he has met with
every encouragement. It is more than
probable that another year will see an-
other big brass and Iron manufacturing
plant in full operation on the coast. The
company's western and foreign orders
have been increasing very rapidly of late
and the prospects of a big trade with
Honolulu are some of the reasons why a
plant is wanted on this coast.
Air. Sanborn says there is no doubt in
his mind as to the election outcome. H-Â»
says in every place he has been, com
1 mencing with New York State, the Mc-
Klnley sentiment is in the majority and
the betting, as a rule, is three to one on
the Republican side. While the whole
country appears to be enjoying a season
of prosperity, Mr. Sanborn says the feel
ing of contentment is strongest in the
West. Californians in particular, he says,
appear to have all the money they want.
* Charles V. Day, representing the Ameri
can Brass and Copper Company of Water
bury. Conn., is also at the Palace and he
reiterates all of Mr. Sanborn's statements
regarding trade conditions. "Why, actu
ally, my firm is so crowded with work
that it has written me to go easy on
orders and to sta^t for home at once."

TN A FOREST FIRE
Bring Damage Suit Against
Owners of a Destroyed Shingle Mill
Neighbors.
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 26,-The Samp
son brothers, who for a number of years
past and up to September 21 last con
ducted a shingle mill In this county, have
commenced an action for 17000 damages
against William Hughes and Alexander
Peers. The suit Is the outcome of a forest
fire that destroyed plaintiffs' mill and
other property. The plaintiffs set forth,
two causes of action, one for the de
struction of 2,000,000 shingles, 430 cords of
shingle blocks. 110 cords of four-foot wood
and woodmen's and other . too*ls valued
at $4500. and the other for the loss of the
mill itself, valued at $2500.
From the complaint It appears that the
plaintiffs and the defendants own ad
joining: tracts of land. Hughes and Peers
are charged with having set out a flre in.
therr woods. They were warned of - the
danger and offered assistance to check the
flames, but the warning was disregarded
and the assistance declined. On Septem
ber 21. the flre got beyond their control,
and, sweeping through' the -~ Sampson
brothers' tract, destroyed their property.

NO MORE POTLATOHES,
SAY ALASKA CHIEFS
Result of Governor Brady's Powwow
With Tribe leaders at
i Klukwan.
VICTORIA, Oct. 26.â When the United
States steamer Perry, which arrived to
day, was leaving Sltka her officers saw
the Sltka Indians departing in nlnÂ« or ten
big wax canoes for the potlatch at Kluk
wan. \ The canoes were richly decorated
with- the Stars and Stripes.
Captain Kilgour was present at a meet-
Ing- held at Halnes. when Governor Brady
addressed Chief Kodowatt and Chief
George Shortridge on the folly of nolding
potlatohes. He told them that the pot
latch was now a custom of the past and
meant nothing but superstitious â¢llsplay,
and urged them not to give the potlatch,
which was a useless extravagance, but
instead to devote the money to the benefit
of the tribe. The chiefs were gready im
pressed and said that had it not been
for the fact that the invitations had been
given and they could not break their
word to the visiting tribes they would
call the potlatch off. They promised that
it would be the last they would hold.
The object of the potlatch â the ealllns
off of the old feud with the Wrangelsâ la
to be lost, for owing to the fact that
Kodowatt was robbed of $700 when he
went to give the Wrangels their invita
tion he refrained from asking the Wran
gels to attend.

Convict. x .
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 26.-The First Na-
tlonal Bank of this city, as a member of
the American Bankers' Association, has
received a circular letter from the Pink
erton Detective Agency Imparting the
"comforting" information that some bank
president In Southern California had been
marked as a victim of a. desperate rob
ber, who would not stop at murder. The
letter says in part:
In the Interest of the American Bankers'
Association we write to warn you regarding
certain information which we recently became
possessed of. A convict was recently dis
charged from a State penitentiary where he
had been Incarcerated for burglary. A short
time prior to his discharge from the peniten
tiary he told another convict, who was also
soon to be liberated, what bis plans were' for
the future. He described a town where a bank
president lived Â«ome distance from the bank
building and said that he and his pal Intended
calling- on the president of the bank at a late
hour of the night and take him by force from
his home and compel him to go with them to
the bank and open the safe. Then they would
take all the money they could find and either
shut tho bank president up in the vault or kill
him, and this would give them ample time to
get quietly cut of town and elude all pursuit.
This convict further stated that the town waa
located in Southern California, but did not
mention the name of it.

ZIONITES PELTED "WITH
EGGS AT VANCOUVER
Leader Simmons Enrages a Crowd by
Denouncing Secret
Societies.
VANCOUVER, Oct. 26.â Before a crowd
of nearly 2U00 persons and with their
gospel impedimenta covered by the mark
ings of stale eggs and marks of other
violent contacts, the ministerial corps of
the Zionites were last night driven by
force into their tabernacle. A sergeant and
six policemen were out to attempt to
guard Rev. Mr. Simmons. The trouble
arose over the Dowie minister announcing
that he would speak against secret socie
ties and their systems. Several days ago
he spoke on the same subject and was
hooted down, and this time the crowd
turned out in great numbers, armed with
a quantity of eggs and decomposed vege
tables.
Simmons preached from a gospel wagon,
around which the cordon of police stood
puard. He denounced the Knights of
Pythias, the Odd Fellows and other orÂ«
ders. The crowd hooted Itself hoarse and
it was with difficulty that the police could
prevent Simmons being carried off bodily.
Soon a shower of oggs started and the
wagons and horses and Simmons himself
were plastered with them. Several
women in the wagon sang hymns, but
their voices were frequently drowned by
the uproar. After traversing the prin
cipal streets the Zionites returned to their
church.

resolution denouncing the civil and mili

mitting the establishment of saloons In
Manila was strengthened in Its terms of
condemnation and changed so as to read
that the action of the authorities was de

United States, as well as the native pa
trons of such places.
The resolution favoring the removal of
hats and bonnets by women while in at

point where the company is involved in
a strike with its miners, is untrue. Ru
mors are In circulation . that the miners
would create trouble if the company at
tempted such a move. The company store
and canteen are both closed, but Ih8
boarding-house is open.
The copper company this morning
posted a notice at the mine announcing
that all strikers who chose to could re
port at noon for work and that those who
failed could ask for their time. Twelve
or fifteen applied for the pay that, was
coming to them, but the rebt neitiier re
ported for work nor demanded their time.
Most of the strikers are still at the mine.
This afternoon the copper company tel
ephoned to the Sheriff's office for an offi
cer to be sent to Iron Mountain. Deputy
Hunter was dispatched to the scene. This
move is not taken to indicate that serious
trouble is apprehended, but that It is
merely a measure of precaution. The
strikers held a meeting at Fielding Post
office, adjacent to the mine, yesterday
afternoon, at which the leaders addressed
thÂ© strikers and appealed to them to re
main firm. A resolution to that effect was
passed by the miners.
Great precaution is being taken by the
leaders to prevent the strikers leaving
the camp. Should the company close Its
boarding-house there is no reason to fear
trouble at the mine in consequence. Many
of the men are married and have their
families at the mine. They have always
been permitted to take boarders if they
chose and a number of the strikers are
thus provided for. Not a few of the men
board themselves and while the company
runs its own store, cajiteen ajid boarding
house it has always pursued a liberal pol
icy with respect to employes patronizing
theee Institutions.
The Mountain Copper Company shows
no disposition to treat with the strikers
on other than Its own terms. The strikers
appear equally firm. The big smelting
plant at Keswick Is working full time
night and day.

VANCOUVER, Oct. 26.â At least five or
six lives were lost and 140,000 worth of
property was destroyed in a storm that
swept the northern coast 150 miles from
Vancouver during "Wednesday night and
Thursday morning. Yesterday afternoon
two boats that had contained two or three
fishermen each were found drifting off
Gower Point, seventy miles from this city."
The boats were large new sailers and the
canvas on both was set, but when found
was sagging deep in the water. When the
boats were righted provisions were found
stowed away in both, so there Is no ques
tion that their recent occupants were
drowned when thrown out during the
gale.
The range of the storm- was about 300
miles along the coast, so far as can be
learned, and it was the roughest on rec
ord in that section. It began on Wednes
day afternoon, when three Klondike
steamers, bound from Skaguay for Van
couver and Settle, were compelled to
turn back for Bhelter after trying In vain
to get across Queen Charlotte Sound. The
steamer Alpha was the fourth, and she
got through, although she suffered con
slderable damage in making the run down
to Vancouver, arriving here on Thursday
afternoon. The steamer Comox came in
during the night, having watched the
Vancouver steamer Comet pick up the
fishing boats before mentioned.
The Comet is a powerful tug.vwhich had
over a million, feet of lumber In a raft.foi
the Hastings mill. She lost the raft and
a scow off.Gower Rocks, near where the
fishermen's boats were found. Two hours
later the steamer Brunette came along
and her towing rones were snapped under
the strain. She had two scows, which
broke to pieces on the rocks, and she also
lost her boom of logs. Captain Moody of
the Comox says that the trip he made
was the roughest he ever experienced on
this coast, and his steamer has been mak
ing twice-a-week trips to Port Neville for
nine years.
A number of email boats are missing
and several small steamers are reported
to be ashore.

SEATTLE. Oct. 26.â With decks and
cabins crowded with wearied men and a
few sad eyed women, the big Government
Transport Lawton pulled into the dock
this afternoon, bringing 550 of those who
were recently accounted the destitute of
Nome City. Starting northward in the
early spring with buoyant . hopes and
dreams of golden wealth in the far
stretching sands of Nome, they return by
the grace of a generous Government,
which now extends its protection to
further prevent their humiliation. No
names of those returning free are given
out. If a passenger list exists, as it must,
it is in the possession of the representa
tives of the Government and regarded as
strictly confidential.
Of the Lawton's passengers, there are
eighty-eight who are not the guests of
the Uovernment. Of these fifty-one are
cabin passengers and thirty-thrt-e are of
ficers and men of the wrecked cable
steamer Orizaba and four are soldiers who
have served their time and taken dis
charge trom posts on the lukon. Fully
B6Â« came down without any or with only
partial payment of fare. There were fif
teen women in -the crowd of destitute.
None of them were old. but all showed
plainly that in the far north they had
fared poorly.
The men as a whole appeared hardy and
vigorousâ a surprisingly healthy lot to call
upon their Government for relief â but
among them ail there are few who have
hard words for Nome itself. The district
was overcrowded, they said; the massiof
litigation prevented any sort of develop
ment: no work was offered: they had
prone in without sufficient means. The
reasons, for their indigence are all plaus
ible and supported by the known facts.
On landing the crowd quickly separated,
and for several hours thereafter the rail
road ticket offices were crowded. A great
number seemed to have held on to enough
money to purchase tickets, mostly third
class, to their homes in other parts of the
country. It is said that probably not more
than fifty of the whole number arrived in
Seattle absolutely penniless.
One death occurred on tho voyage.
James O'Brien died of Bright's disease
on October IS, just as the Lawton was
coming into Dutch Harbor. Papers found
ajnong his papers showed mm to have once
been a sailor. He was about 50 years old.
Beyond this nothing of his identity could
be learned. The body was buried in Dutch
Harbor.
Two of the Lawton's indigent passen
gers' are Insane. W. Bauer and James
Carpenter were Yukon prospectors, who.
after a trip on which they must have un
dergone great hardships, were found by
another party in a starving condition and
mentally unbalanced. They were turned
over to th? military authorities at St.
Michael and sent to Nome for shipment
on the Lawton. Neither Is violent and it
is thousrht that with proper treatment
they will be restored to reason. They will
be examined here and probably 6ent to
one of the State asylums.

TACOMA. Oct. 26.â For some time Labor
Commissioner Blackman has been endeav
oring to obtain evidence showing that the
biff influx of Japanese laborers to thi3
country has been due largely to direct
violation of the contract labor law. Ha
announces that some time ago he obtained
an affidavit from J. F. Bishop, former
bookkeeper for W. II. Remington, labor
commissioner of the Northern Pacific.
Bishop took some money belonging to
Remington about a year ago and waa ar
rested. While Bishop was in jail Carr.-nts
sioner Blackman and Charles Claypool.
then assistant United States .District At
torney, obtained from him an eight-page
afildavit, which, it is claimed, gives posi
tive proof that the importation of Japan
ese has been a regular business. The a:;>
d&vit describes the plan of operations as
follows:
I was to proceed to Vancouver with suffi
cient funds for the purpose, viz. â one thousan.!
dollars â distribute the necessary amount re
quired to each Japanese, take receipts theru
for. and see that the men were started for
Tacoma, when I was to wire the nu:n:Â» r of
men sent ami the amount of money aiivanctil
to them to our agent at Seattle, who wad la
meet the men there and collect such money
from them as they ha<i not spent for railroad
fare and other necessary expenses, and return
It to me at Vancouver, to be used In forwanl
inr the next lot of men. ami so on. until the
required number of men (about nvÂ« bundre-i>
had been procured.
1 Bishop says that under this arranRp
ir.ent he went to Vancouver and engaged
a lot of Japanese, who were sent through
j as planned. Then he 'was called home i>y
1 his principals, who, he claims, became
convinced that detectives were investigat
ing the matter. Bishop states further in
i the afildavit that in the fall of 1S9S or
I spring of. 1899 Remington engraved Y.
! Takaishi to go to Japan and engage for
I him 200 Japanese to work on the Northern
; Pacific. 1IÂ« says Takaishi engaged anil
! sent over part of this number, but failed
to get them ail within the time specified.
He then returned and was employed ad
interpreter for the Japanese on the Clre
gon Short Line Railway under contract
with Remington.
The affidavit recites that Bishop waa
visited by Remington's agents, who, in
return for promises and J1100 In cash, obÂ»
talned from him the papers he possessed
sustaining the allegations made In his
j affidavit. Bishop says that Remington
was receiving 10 cents per day for every
Japanese he put at work; that in Au
gust. 1W9, he had 900 in the service of th3
Northern Pacific. 600 with the Oregon
Short Line and 30) with the Santa Fe. ami
that his profits on the Northern Pacific

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 26.â The State
Commission in Lunacy to-night an
nounced its findings in the investigation
into the sanity of Miss Mary Fraser of
Stockton. The findings are in substance
that P. B. Fraser. the father, was justl-
Iled in hia course in the case of his daugh
ter, but that her condition is such that
she ought not to be detained longer in
an asylum for the insane.
It had been expected that the commis
sion would recommend her detention, if
not in a private asylum at least in a
sanitarium, and the relatives of the girl
who were battling for her release were
so certain of this decision that they had
already mapped out a policy in which the
aid of the courts was to be invoked.
While the province of the Lunacy Com
mission extended only so far as to <>eter
mine whether the young woman should
longer be restrained of her liberty In a
licensed asylum, it is understood here to
have been the distinct conviction of the
commission that the girl, on account of
her eccentricities, as developed during the
investigation, was a proper subject for
parental watchfulness and even restraint.
However, these matters are regarded as
outside the scope of the commission, and
as addressing themselves to those who
are concerned in the young woman s wel
fare. The findings are as follows:
In the matter of the detention of Mary A.
Fraaer at the Pacific Hospital at Stockton CaJ

EAX RAFAEL, Oct. 26.â During the!
trial of J. E. King for the murder of S.
K. Church to-day the defense placed both
King and his wife on the stand and for
the fir&t time since the tragedy King's [
Bide of the trouble was made public. He
tettiiied that after the killing of Church
he started for Santa Rosa and that night
between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock In
the morning he slipped into the Eagle
Hotel arid went to the room he and his
wile usually occupied when staying in
town. Not llnding her there he went along
the corridor of the hotel, softly calling
"Haitie." "Hattie." She did not answer
and he went away from the hotel and hid
in the brush by the creek for the next
three dayB. making occasional visits lo
town after dark.
Airs. King was the first witness called
thas moriiinc. She testified that on the
mornir^ of July 23 she and her husband
tuck their four horses to Stice's barn for
water, the door being open. Her husband
led one horse in and was holding the other
outsiae when Stice came over and said:
"You fellows hn'e a gall to water your
horses here without my permission." King
replied: "I did not know I was doing
anything wrong I don't think your
language was very gentlemanly." They
then went down to their camp on the
road. Tbey did not go near Suce's well
ai.d their horses were on the road.
Boon Church and Stice came down and
w tKt to the weli and commenced to nail
it up. They were saying all the time:
VCarcperp and tramps won't get any more
Oilier here." The two men came out on
the road and Church, using violent lan-
Suagc, advanced.
"I'll tear your tent off the fence and
put it in the middle of the road and blow
you off the earth," he declared, with
oaths.
Klnp, who -was sitting: on his bed, laid
his hand on his rirte and paid:
"Don't come any closer or I'll shoot"
'Shoot and be damnea," replied Church,
a.t the same time malung a rapid move
ment with his right naxid toward his hip
pocket. King fired without rising from
the bed. Church fell a;id Stice ran away,
afterward returning and taking Church
to his house, declining the assistance of
Kin/?. When Church fell Kins hurriod
to him and offered him water and aid
but both were declined.
When Mrs. King reached this point In
her story the prisoner exclaimed:
"I would sire worlds if I hadn't been
compelled to do it."
Speaking of King's flight Mrs. King
said: "My husband wanted to give ,
himself up. but I told him that the
Church boys and Stice would kill him on
the road and that Mrs. Stice had told me
to look out and have him hurry."
A severe cross-examination did not :
shake Mrs. King's story. \
King wai the next witness. His descrip
tion of how he looked for his wife in the
Eagle Hotel and called her name was dra
xr.atic. He told of having ceen armed man
In wagons patroling the roads while hÂ«
was hiding- on the outskirts of the city
ajid overheard several remarks such as
".Pop it tn ii!tn on eight." This terrified
iiirc and he did not know what to do. ' He
wanted to see his wife for her advice.' He
dmed late at night several times in a
Santa Kosa. restaurant. On the third day
h<? escaped from the brush and struck out
across the country.
King was subjected a long and severe
cross-examination, lasting until late this
evening, but his story remained practi
cally unshaken. His marvelous coolness
on the stand was a surprise to every one
A strong effort will be made to close the
case to-morrow.

From time to time during the last few

taken iip seriously at the University of

a challenge to the University' of Wash

â¢within twelve months. Rowing being
dead or practically non-existent at Stan

compete with tne University of California
Is Washington. The University of Wash

and already has a crew. During the win

Santa Cruz team- possesses' considerable
batting and bowling strength and Inter
esting games are expected.
"Not much of anything" Is the reply of
the duck shooters when prodded with
questions about the size of their strings,
and in most Instances they adhere strictly
to the truth. This warm spell has played
havoc with successful shooting, and
brought very little else but misery to the
few shooters who have frequented the
marshes during the week. Not only have
the birds been scarce, but the physical
discomfort consequent upon working in a
pond with a fierce sun overhead has
taken all enthusiasm out of the occasional
shooter and most of It out of the fanatic.
The Suisun marshes are still the favored
quarters. Last Sunday the total number
of birds bagged by the members of the
Field and Tule Club at Cordelia did not
reach 100â a very small number In com
parison with past shoots, which showed
as many to a single gun. On Wednesday
H. B. Hosmer, Al Cummings and J. V.
Coleman were out to force their luck.
They returned with sour faces and bad
tempers.
C. A. Halght, "W. J. Hynes, James May
nard, Ed Wands, H. -Jessons and Billy
Wattson tried the pondB of 'the Canvas
back Club on Sunday. Billy Watson was
high man, with only a fair string. May
nard bagged twenty-three English enlpe.
J. J. Altube and J. Fatjo of Los Banos
claim to have had a good shoot. early in
the week. *
Colonel Eddy was one of the lucky ones
last Sunday. He sent a sack of birds to
the city.
Dr. C. ,G. Levison, Dr. Quinan, K. Qul
nan. Captain , Self ridge and J. B. .Kenniff
were out for a coyote hunt on Sunday
last back of Pinole. They killed three in
a day's hard work. All agree as to the
number and to the great quantities of
quail and Jacksnipe in the neighborhood.

The quail shooters are, not over-anxious
this season, although good! reports come
from Marin and adjacent counties. Unless
Shooters Want Wind,

the hot weather comes to a quick termina

During the last three weefcs Sacramento
has broken loose from the bunch of clubs
and gone up the column like mercury
â¢with a. hot cigar under the bulb of the
thermometer. About 50 per cent separates
the Senators from the local team and the
chances of the latter to touch the for
mer thiÂ»> season are rery slender. Oniy
by a Fucce*=sion of great disasters to Sac
ramento and rope-colored visitations of
luck to San Francisco can the breach be
narrowed.
For a time the race for championship
honors was as exciting as even the moÂ»t
rabid fanatic could picture. Then the
local team slumped ar.d by so doing sent
6hafta of pain into ihe hearts of thou-
Muids who had worn out lungs and
throa-ta in Its behalf. Xot so with Sacra
mento. That team continued to play
championship ball and when the Senators
met the Dude* It waÂ« an easy matter for
them to annex two out of the three game*
played. At Stockton last Sunday the Mill
ers rubbed two defeats into the Wasp3
and threw them down several pegs.
Stockton ha* been playing pood ball of
late and much interest is displayed in the
meet between Stockton and Sacramento
this week. From present indications the
race for second place will be the new
pha*e of Interest In the league strurplo.
If Btockton can keep up Its pace the local
team will find & battle below as well as

to cling to the bottom rim of the skirts.

ROUNDING THE LINKS
IN CLUB COMPETITION
Some changes have already taken place
in the challenge class of the ladles at the
Presidio link?. Miss Maud Mullins having
won second place by defeating Miss M. B.
Houghton and havlnc challenged Mrs. R.
Oilman Brown for first position. As Miss
Maud MtiMins has improved considerably
and is playing a strong game it Is thought
that r-he can make the contest Interesting
for Mr?. Brown.
La^t Saturday there were two competi
tions in driving on the course of the San
Francisco Golf Club, one being for best
average distance of three balls, with roll;
and the other for best average of three
balls on the carry. Both contests were
won by Lansing O. Kellogg. There was a
strong cross wind, which Interfered con
siderably with the direction of the drives.
It is not unlikely that some change will
be made in the regular competition among
the men held on the first Saturday in each
month on the Presidio links. Instead of
a handicap open to all members of the
club there may be a match between tftams
A and B. each consisting of eight or ten
players, over eighteen holes, stroke play,
with handicap. Last Saturday "Warren
Gregory, who won the previous contest
Â¦with a gross score of 103. received a han
dicap of plus 2. As he made the high
pcore of 119 the added two raised his card
to 121. The winner, J. 8. Severance, madÂ«
a score of 103 less 4â09 net.
A golf club has been organized in Sacra

Last year the stake was confined to
thirty-two dogs and consumed two days
in the running. But this was at Merced,
where the hares were so scarce on the
first day that very often an hour elapsed
between separate courses. The commit

tion reports a plenitude of hares and
the fields In fine condition. More than
that, accommodations at Modesto are so
much suoerior to those of Merced that
comparison is almost out of the question.
The coursing ground is three miles out
of Modesto. A much larger entry Is antic

With the echoes of the $6600 John Oraca

ON the Sixteenth and Folsom

the University of California and

itself connotes vast quantities of noise
nnd much color display. It will be a pre
lude to the big Thanksgiving game.
Farm comparisons mark the California

surprise to the California contingent, as
well as the cardinal, if a reversal of form
rhould be exhibited on the field this after

players, whose work has been brilliant
enough to Insure them coveted places on
the varsity squad. To complete all. that
last week baa seen a phenomenal brace,
l.oth .is regards spirit and team play.
I ick and Santa Clara, both of whom could
have beaK-n the freshmen two weeks ago,
have been deft a ted by large scores within
the lost live days.
Competition for the place.s has been keen
and careful distinctions have had to be
made before 1 the rÂ«on were picked. Espe
cially is this true of the positions behind
the "line, for which seven strong candi
dates have been Striving with almost even
credit. Sherman. Whipple. Kaeding and
McCormlck are four halfbacks of un
usual ability. Sherman has been conceded
his plsiÂ«-e from the first. He excels in
swift j-c-ittered field running:, in fighting
through the line, holding his feet with re
markable tenacity; and in strong defens
ive work. The other half has been evenly
fought for by Kaeding and Whipple. The
former, during his rival's prolonged ab
sence on account of a bruised shoulder,
developed surprising ability for so light
n man. But Whipple, in the week that
he has been out a.qaJn, has shown that,
besides superior weight, he possesses all
the m-cessary speed and strength to win
him the plate. In both end running and
lino smashing; he has proved himself an
Invaluable man. Skinner and Rowland
have been struggling neck and neck for
(liiartorback Both, are splendid dashing
players, equally gmd nt passing the ball
or running with it. clever in the inter
ference, and fierce, sure tacklers. Row
land's superior weight, more than any
thing else, gives him the position.
Fautz has been all along the man for
fullback, his work being of such a high
order that he has been deemed valuable
varsity material. IIiÂ« punting is above
the ordinary and his line bucking is much
better since he has corrected, to a great
degree, his tendency to get off slowly and
hit the line high. '
The line is now a source of considerable
satisfaction to the coaches. It is heavy
and strong and has developed some co
herent team-play, especially on the de
fensiveâa point in which most freshman
teams are notably weak. With Captain
Starr; a- man slated for the varsity, at
left end. and with Stow, the star tackle,
who. has been moved up to right guard
on both varsity and freshman teams, the
line possesses two extraordinary players.
Sta-rr is still suffering from a rather se-
vere blow received a week agoâ an injury
which may force him to leave the game
ea The two tackles will be Savage and
Ramsaur. The latter man has. until late
ly, been a candidate for* fullback. But
Fautz has had such a lead on the pl-tco
that ho has consented to be shifted to
the line, where his improved play would
seem to indicate that he has finally found
his right place. Stow's mate at guard is
Hector, the old Olympic center rush. Both
these men. like the tackles, are unusually
husky men. Phillips at center has won
his place from Duff by a superiority in
defensive play. He is rather small, but
plays a stiff aggressive game.
In the practice this evening Starr, cap
tain and left end. sustained injuries
which will incapacitate him from playing
in the game to-morrow. Stowe will cap
tain the team in his place.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 26.â
The freshman team which will represent
Stanford in the annual intercollegiate
match to-morrow is the most evenly bal
anced aggregation that has represented
the cardinal for several years. It has no
stars, nor Is there any one man who Is
expected to do more for a victory than
any other one member of the team. The
men feel that- they have a fighting chance
of winning and each is ready to do his part.
"PLAY HARD, FRESHMEN!" WILL
BE THE CRY OF COLLEGIANS
at full, who axe bothered with sprained
knees. * v. â,
The varsity team was put at heavy
practice on Wednesday against the sec
ond team. The play was brtsk and the
big team had no trouble In working biff
pains. The most appreciable improve
ment was In the punting of Hills, his Ions
drives averaging fifty yards.
In the evening the colleco people will
attand a monster entertainment given at
8 o'clock in Golden Gate Hall, the proceeds
to b* devoted to the use of the Stanford
University Constitutional Amendment
Club.
The team, is lightâ probably the lightest
freshman team that Stanford has ever
sent out. To offset this disadvantage la
speed, grit and cleverness. The team
work wiil probably not be above the aver
age, as several of 'the men back of the line
have been out of the frame the past week
on -account of either sickness or injury.
In the only game of this last week,
they were tied by the Palo Alto team and
very nearly defeated. Their work in mass
formation was little superior to that of
three weeks ago. However, the men will
go in to-morrow's game In the best con
dition, barring Lunt at left end and Clark

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 26.â
Fifteen hundred students and alumni
watched the team composed of Stanford
graduates humiliate the varsity to-day in
one of the most exciting campus games
of the season. The scoreâ Alumni 13, Var
sity 0â only partially tells the tale. From
the time that Traeger missed two at
tempts to kick off till Yost carried the ball
over for the last touchdown everything
went in favor of the alumni. The under
graduates forgot all they had learned in
two months' coaching and bowed meekly
to the spirit of '95.
With Reynolds, Flckert and Murphy in
the play the graduates were able to circle
the varsity ends repeatedly. Murphy at
quarter was the star of the game, his
fifty-yard run through a scattered field
being the feature of the day. The line
up was as follows:
Alumni. Position. Varsity
Nourse... L-Endâ R Cooper
Fickert Lâ Tackleâ R Burnett
Luvers L â Guard â R Seeley
Gregory â¢ Center i^
T. McFadden Râ Guardâ L r> Forrest
Harper Râ Tackleâ L Traeger
Parker Râ Endâ L. Allen
Murphy Quarter B r b
Plote .......Lr-Halfâ R Fisher. Smith
Reynolds Râ Halfâ L Gelssler
Yost... Fullback .Hill
Umpire â Haslocher, '00. Refereeâ Andryde
ex-'?5.
The game opened by the alumni kicking
off to Hill, who returned to Murphy. The
alumni was forced to kick again, but re
gained the ball on a returned. Coach Yost
at full for the alumni made three yards
through the line and helped Reynolds
make -twenty more by magnificent inter
ference. Twice the varsity's five-yard line
was crossed, but-each time the ex-stars
were unable to force the ball over. Flnally
Murphy punted from the middle of the
field to GeisBler.who was forced over his
own goal line for a safety. Scoreâ Alum
ni 2, Varsity 0. Time was called at the
end of this play.
During the play of this half Fisher, var
sity halfback, was sent from the field with
a broken collarbone, an Injury that may
keep him. out of the big Thanksgiving
game.
In the second half the reverse of what
was expected happened. From the fact
that the alumni players had had no train
ing It was argued that they would lack
both speed and strength. Everybody was
surprised when they braced up and made
two touchdowns. - ;
With Hill out of the game. Murphy be
gan the punting contest. Two punts were
all that were necessary for a touchdown
for both times the alumni ends were too
fast for their opponents. Barker followed
the oval and fell upon it when Gelssler
had finished toying ? with it back of the
goal-posts. Murphy kicked the goal. The
score was 8 to 0. .
The second touchdown was made after
Yost had recovered the ball from Mur
phy's punt. With- the leather tucked

Decision Affecting Registration.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 26.â The District
Attorney's offlce has rendered the County
Clerk an important opinion affecting reg

been thought that under the provisions
of the general registration act registration
for municipal elections should close forty
days prior to the day of election, but the
District Attorney declares that a special
municipal election law, passed by the
Legislature in March, 1S99, provides for
the holding open of registration books for
city elections until twenty-five days prior
to election, so that registration- for the
Los Angeles city election, which was to

thorough accord with his sentiments. The
speaker made Colonel Bryan and his Isms
the paramount issue of the campaign, and
treated the subject with keen sarcasm and
irony. Every reference to -the flag, the
army and navy and the President was
cheered to the echo. The financial and
general prosperity of the country was
placed before the audience, and the full
dinner pail proved' to be the rule and not
the exception throughout the land. The
Rough Riders, an organization of Repub
lican young men, escorted the speaker to
and from his hotel.

AUBURN, Oct. 26.â Seldom, if ever be
fore, have the people of Placer County
given such a reception to a candidate as
that to-night accorded "Sam p. Woods,
nominee for Congress in this district on
the Republican ticket. The evening's pro
gramme opened with a procession of torch
bearers, who marched through the streets
accompanied by a brass band from Pen
rvn and the local band. Along the line of
march the streets were lined with people
o- Auburn, | Newcastle. Penryn and â¢ tho
surrounding country, who discharged fire
works and cheered continuously for
Woods and the Republican ticket. The
procession, which was in column of fours,
was several blocks long and when it
reached the opera-house, where the meet-
Ing was held, it found every seat taken
and many of the marchers were unable
to gain admission.
When Mr. Woods stepped upon the stage
he received a splendid ovation and j the
unfurling of a large American flag bear-
Ing the words, "Who will haul down the
flag?" ... brought the people to their feet
in an uproar of applause. The enthusiasm
with which Mr. Woods' speech was re
ceived could not have been surpassed. At
times it was so extreme as to cause the
speaker to pause for . several moments.
The chairman of the ecenlng was Judge

Auburn's Enthusiastic Reception to
PABADE AND PYROTECHNICS.
Throughout the day at every town and
hamlet the procession was received with
enthusiasm. From every sound-money
farmer's residence floated Old Glory and
at every 'crossing of the roads the pic
tures of McKlnley and Roosevelt were in
evidence. Before each roadside school
house the children were lined up to see
and cheer the procession.
One of the attractive features of the
parade was the empty dinner pall and the
full dinner pail. The former was carried
on a pole and fastened in a sorry old
buggy, drawn by a sorry old horse. The
empty dinner pall was represented by a
battered two-quart lard can. Immediate
ly following was a spruce wagon drawn
by two spruce horses and carrying a huge
milk can, which had Its lid raised by the
fdod bulging from it.
To-night, as a preliminary to the big
meeting here In the opera-house, at which
Hon. W. M. Peck. Senator Bard and Sen
ator Perkins addressed an immense au
dience, the Columbia Marching Club,
headed by a band, paraded the streets,
red fire flamed and the city was invaded
by the greatest throng that has been seen
within Its limits since the campaign first
opened. The opera-house, with a seating
capacity of 1000, was packed to its
utmost, and more people were turned
away than would have filled the building
twice over. W. M. Peck of Riverside ad
dressed a big overflow meeting on the
street and the crowd in the opera-house
listened to a short address by Senator
Bard and a speech of nearly two hours'
duration by Senator Perkins.
SANTA ANA, Oct. 26.â To-day was a
Republican holiday and the political ex
citement that has burned with more or
less Intensity since the campaign began
culminated in a Republican demonstration
unique in the annals of the struggle for
political supremacy In this county. The
occasion was a walk-around, or tour of
the county, participated in by prominent
Republicans of the neighborhood, the ob
ject of which was to visit every village
of importance and address the people at
their homes. A procession of several hun
dred citizens in carriages, headed by brass
bands and a cavalry escort 100 strong,
started from this city and drove to Ana
heim, where Senator Bard joined the par
ty. Addresses were made at Anaheim by
Hon. W. M. Peck of Riverside and Sena
tor Bard, and when the crowd reached
Fullerton Senator George C. Perkins had
arrived from Riverside. Speeches were
delivered at Fullerton by Senator Bard,
Senator Perkins and W. M. Peck. The
speakers were enthusiastically received.
Big crowds gathered and were insistent
in their demands that the speechmakine
be prolonged.
From Fullerton to Placentla was the
next move, and again the waiting crowds
were addressed on the issues of the cam
paign. With the procession strongly aug
mented, the march was taken to Olive,
where a halt was called for luncheon and
an hour spent In renewing old acquain
tances and forming new ones. From
there the procession went to El Modena,
Villa Park and Orange and home again to
Santa Ana, arriving at 5:30 p. m., schedule
time.

On the evening that the amateurs signed
for the monthly exhibition the bantam
twin presented himself before Greggaln3
and Alec, satisfied with his appearance,
matched him to do battle with Kelly.
Brother John then began training and
on the night of the fight weighed twelve
pounds more than the prescribed weight.
His twin brother was again sent to the
front and. like a dutiful youne man,
stepped on the scales and the beam bal
anced to a nicety at 112 pounds. He then
donned his clothes and lost himself in
the crowd. Then brother John hove in
sight and stripped for the fray. Having
the advantage . in weight, strength and
reach he Â¦won out handily.
The silver medal is now the lolnt prop
erty of the twins. According' to agree
ment they alternate in wearing the tro
phy.
Match-maker Greggains Is wroth, but
h!s> feelings are not a mark compared
with those of Kelly. The latter is search
ing for the twins and when they meet
there will be no explanations, but a scene
that will outshine a scrimmage on tho
gridiron.
ALEC GREGGAINS. the astute
match-maker, referee, manager

true value of the article yesterday. Alec

uncertain upon whom to wreak venge

is still undecided.
At. a recent monthly fistic exhibition
of his club, among the contest
ants was a heavily muscled youth
who Failed ur.d<r the euphonious title of
â¢ # Kid" Kr^ll. The latter had as his op
ponent a youth named Jack Kelly. Both
were scheduled to weieh in at the ring
tide at 112 pounds and the articles of
agreement were carried out to the letter.
Â¦When the lad? entered the roped arena
to do battle It was plainly evident tha 1 :
Krell was hcavkr and stronger than Kel
ly. Even Kelly saw the dinerence and
marveled at thÂ«? sudden development of
his opponent. He waÂ« not given much
time to protest, as the clanc of the gongr
sent the boxers together. Kelly was bat
tered and bruised in the first round, but
made a gallant fight against palpable
odds. His risrht "light"' was extinguished
bv a left uppercut and his " slats'* bore
evidence of a collision with a hard flst.
Kellv stayed with the game until the
third round, when Krell sent him to. the
carpet with a hard right. Greggains saw
that Kelly was no match for_Krell. so he
stopped the" fi^ht" and with a flourish
handed an engraved silver medal to tho
\ictor.
It developed after the fight that Kelly
was a victim of foul play and that his
erstwhile opponent was a conspirator. It
seems that "Kid" Krell fights under false
colors to avoid parental Interference and
objection. His true name Is John Krell

are as much alike as two peas in a pod.

In the meantime* the Republican campaign^ has been
increasing in vigor not only in the North but in the
border States of the South. The popular demonstra
tions in its favor have been particularly notable at
all meetings where Roosevelt or Senator Hanna was
the principal speaker. These two men have been a
host in themselves. Roosevelt" has been'able to rouse
not only the enthusiasm of Republicans but"the an- :
tagonism of the Bryanites. There has been no lack'
of excitement and ardor where he has spoken. In
fact, he has proven himself a better campaigner than
Bryan and has more strongly moved the 'minds of all
who have heard him. As for Senator Hanna, the
warmth of the reception he has had from the people
shows that the cartooning, lampooning and carica-.
turing of the Bryan journals' have not in any way af
fected'the public mind. He has been .everywhere
greeted with the highest enthusiasm and listened" to
with close attention. Moreover, he has proven him
self to be a public speaker of. a high order of merit.'
â¢ â¢ '-' â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦' - Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ , Â¦ , â¢
Bryan himself appears .to have been carried away
by them. He stuck clcse to the anti-imperial text and
had not one word to say about silver. He made four
speeches and, judged by the standards of stump ora
tory, was successful. The big crowds cheered and
applauded him until his heart was: ready to burst with
pride. In his good-night speech he said: "You have
given me reason to cry, 'Great'is Tammany Hall, and
Croker is its prophet.'."
I â ;OR a long period after the opening of the cam-
I paign there was in all parts of the country some
* thing like a spirit of complete apathy among the
people. Republicans were so sure of victory they
thought it hardly necessary to make a strenuous fight,
and the Bryanites were so indifferent* they could
scarcely rally vigor enough to hold ratification meet
ings. A striking change has come over the masses of
the people now. There is no longer any sign of
apathy on the Republican side, and the very energy
with which they are prosecuting the campaign 'has
forced the Bryanites to display a good deal of activ
ity themselves.
One of the significant features of tne contest is that
the scene of the greatest Democratic activity this year
has been in New York. Four years ago Bryan de
nounced New York as the "enemy's country" and
hardly had any support there at all. This year he has
found there his warmest welcome. His reception
was a striking demonstration of what Tammany' can
do 'in the way of bringing out a tumultuous crowd
when it exerts all its energies. At the banquet given
to Bryan in that city there was not a statesman of na
tional reputation present, not a' single Democrat emi
nent in any line of business or profession; it was a
strictly Tammany feast, and the demonstrations at the
speeches and receptions that followed were strictly
I Tammany affairs, but none the less all reports declare
i them to have been among the greatest political mani-
I festations ever witnessed in that city.
THE RISING OF THE PEOPLE.
What should be done by Good Roads conventions
everywhere is to adopt measures which will quicken
the consciences of local taxpayers and local Super
visors and Councilmen. They are the parties who are
responsible: for bad streets Â¦ and roadsl
Under our system the English â¢common law doc
trine that the highways of the nation belong to the
king has been merged into the theory that the' States
are the kings. As this theory has been worked out on
this side of the water, there are in the United States
as many kings as there are admitted States. These
kings in convention have delegated certain . of their,
powers to another king called: the National Govern
ment. .The latter . monarch possesses no. power for
which express authority cannot be found in his char
ter or constitution, and so, after all, nothing can be
dene nationally with. the roadways of the nation with
out violating our theory of State sovereignty. Â¦
Unless a different system is introduced it will be idle
tc petition Congress for the improvement of the road
ways of the country. In fact, we doubt whether any
thing short of; a constitutional amendment could in
vest the national legislature with power to improve
any roads outside of the territory over. which ''it exer
cises direct control. .
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BAD ROADS.
AT the Good Roads Convention at Los Angeles
the other day one of the speakers called atten
tion to the fact that the last Congress appro
priated $25,200,000 for the rivers and harbors of the
nation and only $14,000 for the improvement of its
roadways. He added that the roadways thus ignored
measured 3,500,000 lineal miles and that more than 90
per cent of the products of the soil and mines of the
country are moved over them before reaching railway
stations or the wharves of the national waterways.
.These are interesting figures, but they are not ex
actly applicable to the situation upon which this
speaker commented. Congress has no jurisdiction
over the roadways of the country except those which
are located entirely within territory for which it is
authorized by the constitution to pass laws. In
every organized State of the Union the roadways be
long to the commonwealth, and in most of the States
power to manage and improve them has been con
ferred by the State governments upon the various
county and city organizations. While, technically, the
streets of San Francisco belong to the State of Cali
fornia, they are, as a matter of fact, entirely under the
control of the local authorities. Whatever neglect they
suffer, therefore, cannot be laid at the door of Con
gress, nor even at the door of the State Legislature.
They are a charge upon the taxpayers of the city, and
it is their business to see that they are kept in repair.'
Those who have a thought of voting for Henry G.
Dibble should be willing to accept the criticism that
their business interests make it advisable for them to
have a member of the third house intrenched among
men who still have political morality.
Many pleas are made by the bosses for their pets.
Sr.ch picas are urged with no little cunning and some
times deceive the unwary. In the present campaign,
for example, the bosses and the managers of the
Southern Pacific Company are urging Republican
voter? to support certain disreputable men on the
pound that the election of those men will be neces
sary to enable the "Republican party to apportion the
Congressional and legislative districts of the Stat
rndcr the new census.. That plea, though so persis
tently urged, is without any valid force. In the State
Scnat- the Republican? have fifteen of the hold-over
.Senators and have a fair assurance of electing four
tren of the twenty Senators to be chosen this ye?.r.
There i* no danger of Democratic control. Why,
then, should any intelligent man deem it necessary for
l'.tm to cast his vote for a boodler in politics simply
because the bosses Have succeeded, by the aid of the
Democratic push, in getting control of the Republi
can primary and nominating him on the Republican
ticket? . .' â
Questions of that kind should be maturely consid
ered by every voter. California has great interests at
stake in her local campaign, and the most important
<-'f them is that of providing an honest government.
The Republican party has nominated so many *">nest
men it is not necessary for any Republican to \^\t for
a creature of the bosses. Men who spend $1800 for *
seat in the Assembly are not worthy of the support
of loyal Republicans, nor is any other crooked politi
cian. Jjct all such candidates be defeated.
The type of candidate who should be rejected even
by his own party is very well known. When, for ex
ample, a man boasts of having expended $1800 in
making a campaign fcr the Assembly the public can
readily understand he is not in politics for patriotic
purposes only. When a man is reputed throughout
the community to be a "crooked politician" the voter
can be fair]y certain he is a good man to vote against.
All such men should be defeated. The welfare of the
State is largely dependent upon the honesty of pub
lic officials, and dishonest legislators can do much to
orprive the people of the fuH benefits they would
otherwise derive from their industry and thrift.
An approval of the action of that convention will
not imply the support of each and every man whom
it nominated. It means only that the convention
has done well in reminding the public that an intelli
gent choice should be exercised at the polls and that
no man should vote for the tools of the bosses simply
because they have been labeled with the names of the
party to which the voter belongs.
Such being the caÂ«e every effort to bring the minds
ci the people to a study of State issues is commend
able, for it constitutes an important public service.
The action taken by the Citizens' Republican Con
vention, for example, merits the approval of the whole
body of citizens, for if was a step of that kind, and
t~nds to the overthrow of bosses and the purification
of State politics by the election of honest men.
POPULAR attention in the years of Presidential
campaigns is directed almost exclusively to is
sues of national politics. By a considerable
number of people State issues are completely over
looked, the character of candidates for State office
are but little studied,. and every feature of the State
canvass is treated as a matter of comparatively little
importance. It is inevitable there should be a tendency
of that kind, for great contests naturally distract at
tention from smaller ones, but nevertheless there is al
ways danger of evil results from it. Political bosses
take advantage of the absorption of the people in na
tional affairs to lay schemes for obtaining control of
State governments. Not infrequently they place upon
the tickets of their parties men who have not a particle
of party loyalty any more than of patriotism, but who

PERSONAL MENTION.
These figures show that while there is here and
there an attempt to get rid of competition and to re
strain legitimate trade, the effect of combinations of
capital taken as a whole has been far different from
what the Bryanites assert. With manufactured ar
ticles falling in price and farm products rising, the
people have no reason to be discontented with th:
tendencies of the time. V;^
Note the contrast 10 those figures shown by. the re
ports of prices of farm products. They run thus:
Corn shows an advance from Z9 X A cents per bushel on
January i to 48^ cents on October 1; wheat, from
73.8 cents per bushel on January 1 to 79.7 cents on
October 1; barley, from 45 cents per bushel on Janu
ary 1 to 59 cents on October r; hogs, from $4 50 per
100 pounds on January 1 to $5 30 on October 1; cot
ton, from 7 11-16 cents per pound on January 1 to
10.8 cents on October 1; cottonseed, from $12 per ton
on January 1 to $17 35 per ton on October 1. -,.' '..â¢Â¦
The statements for manufactured goods run thus:
Comparing prices at the beginning of the present
month with those at the beginning of the present
year a fall of from io to 40 per cent is shown. Tin
plate shows a reduction of 24 per cent on October" 1,
1900, as compared with January 1, 1900; refined petro
leum, 21 per cent; common window glass, 12 per cent;
wire nails, 30 per cent;, barbed wire, 26 per cent;
Bessemer pigiron, 46 per cent; steel rails, 26 per cent;
yellow pine lumber, 14 per cent; sisal rope, 38 per
cent; manila rope, 32 per cent; leather, 10 per cent;
shoes of various grades, from 7 per 'cent to 10 per
cent; woolen dress goods of various grades,' from 5
per cent to 12 per cent.
The facts are not difficult to obtain. The prices of
leading articles of manufacture and of farm produce
are regularly gathered by the Bureau of Statistics for
publication in the monthly summary of Commerce
and Finance. The showing made in the publication
for this month will astonish men who believe that
trusts are able to fix prices at extortionate rates an ( J
defy competition. Instead of manufactured goods
going up in price while farm products are going down,
the reverse is the^case. While all of the figures re
lating to manufactured articles show a reduction on
October i this year, as compared with January i,
nearly all the figures on the prices of farm products
show an advance. â¢
WhJflT THE PRICES SHOW.
WHILE Bryan and the men who follow his lead
are busy in the campaign denouncing trusts and
declaring that those combinations of capital
are raising prices to the consumer while depressing
the price of the raw material produced by "the farmer
and- the miner they will not have time to give any
study to the facts, but when the campaign is over any
sincere man who may have been deluded into Bryan
ism will do well to review the controversy now going
on and see how far from truth the Bryan assertions
are.

HOW THE MISER KEEPS
IN TOUCH WITH THE TIMES
These in brief are the more important issues which
the young voter has to face. As for his personal for
tunes, they will be safe in the hands of the party that
provides prosperity. The young man has no interests
opposed to the general welfare of the community.
When prosperity abounds he will be prosperous, and
if calamity come he will suffer with the rest.
In contrast to Croker's plea to a young man con
sider this declaration of Secretary Long concerning
what issues the new voter has to face: "He must
decide whether, being now on a tidal wave of pros
perity brought about as the result of Republican prin
ciples, he is justified in promoting the supremacy of
Democratic principles which were responsible for the
years of national depression which characterize the re
ccnt administrations of the Democratic party. He
must decide whether he favors honest and stable
money, which the Republican party insured by its en
actment of the gold standard, or debased money, the
sure consequence of the free silver heresy which the
Democratic party specifically advocates. He must de
cide whether he shall support the administration
which carried the nation through a successful war and
added to its jurisdiction new possessions which his
country's intelligence and humanity will develop to
the enjoyment of stable institutions and local self
government, or shall repudiate the victories he and
his brothers-in-arms won at Santiago and Manila an:i
abandon to anarchy, or to the sway of foreign Govern^
ments, the islands which are a sacred trust on the
American people."
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that the young
man in politics has other questions than those of his
personal fortune to consider. He has to think of his
country and his fellow citizens.. He has to give con
sideration to the traditions of the past, the duties of
the present and the destiny of the future.
What does Bryanism offer to any ardent, patriotic
and aspiring young American? From first to last it
is a clamor against wealth, a cry to arouse class preju
dices, and an effort to break up the very foundations
of business and prosperity. WHiat" can young men
expect from an overthrow of the protective tariff and
the gold standard? What from a subversion of the
Supreme Court? What from a government of the
United States administered as Tammany administers
that of New York?
Â¦ It is not likely that any young man of intelligence
has given. much if any heed to. Croker' s words. A
young man who has sense enough to justify him in ex
pecting to rise in life has sense enough to know that
a party which keeps the mills working, the farms pros
perous, and provides profits, work and wages for all
classes of people is the party whose legislation opens
the largest number of the broadest avenues for the ad
vancement of young men.
The assertion was not only false in itself, but its
falseness was made the more glaring by the fact that
it was uttered by Croker, the boss of Tammany Hall,
a political trust that has dominated New York City
bo completely that no young Democrat can rise there
without being a servant of that trust. Doubtless it
was by contemplation of the powers of his own po
litical machine that Croker was led to utter his warn
ing. He knows he controls all the offices in that great
city, that he can keep an aspiring young Democrat
from receiving even. so much as a hearing, should he
choose to do so, and he has fallen into the belief that
there are other trusts equally potent elsewhere and in
other fields. .
ONE of the most striking exhibitions ever made
in American politics of that quality commonly
called gall was the statement of Boss Croker
of New York that young men should vote for Bryan
because the success of the Republican party would
mean .the control of all lines of industry by trusts, so
that the young man would have no opportunity to rise
in life and not even a chance to make a living unless
he became subservient to the trusts.

city, and with that expects to overcome, the Repub

.overconfidence .'prevailed, among Republicans he
might have done so, but now even such a vote as that
in the city will probably be more than offset by the
tremendous vote that will be given in the State for
McKinley and prosperity. There, is no longer any
apathy. The people are. in line for victory.

The Kvening Telegram to-day prints the
statement that Alvord was taken to and
is still in a sanitarium not far from
Mount Vernon. The assertion Is made
that when the defaulter knew he had been
detected in his stealing he completely col
lapsed.
Alvord had not been under surveillance
up to that time, although It has been said
that he was suspected as early as the 16th
inst. The bank officials are convinced
that he did not go to his home the night
of the ISth, and they are also convinced
that he has not been there since the
morning of that date.
Alvord's crime came to light exactly
three days after the national bank exam
iners completed their examination. While
the First National Bank officers admit
that Alvord'e wrongdoing is In no degree
the result of any laxity on the part of
the examiners, yet they seem somewhat
annoyed at what they regard as misrepre
sentations,on the part of those attached
to the office of the Comptroller of the
Currency at Washington.
A reward of $5000 will be offered by the
First National Bank for the arrest and
detention of Alvord. This conclusion was
arrived at and the announcement made to
day after a long conference of the bank
officials with Captain McCluskey of the
Detective Bureau.
By this time the suspicions of the assist
ant cashier had become very much
aroused. All the high officials of the bank
had gone for the day, ' but, meeting a
number of clerks, Mr. Backus went hur
riedly over the note teller's books and in
a few moments had overwhelming proof
of Alvord's guilt.
Mr. Hine did not say how Alvord
learned that he was under suspicion, but
he confirmed the report that the note tell
er returned to the bank early on Thurs
day evening, and seeing others at worn
upon his books, realized that he had beeD
discovered.
NEW YORK. Oct. 26.â In order to make
clear certain alleged misstatements Vice
President Hine of the First National Bank
to-day explained In detail some of the in
cidents leading: up to the discovery of Al
vord's crime. In the first place, Mr. Hlne
said Alvord had worked steadily and
without suspicion untilthe afternoon of
the 18th inst. By the merest accident a
clerk saw him make certain erasures in
the clearing house sheet and, while he
thought this unusual, said nothing %bout
it to anybody until shortly after 4 o'clock.
By that time Alvord had gone, but It was
expected that he would return, as he had
some work to finish. {'
Â¦ When Alvord Tailed to return, the clerk
who had seen him make the erasures
made casual mention of the matter to
Assistant Cashier Backus. The latter,
without suspecting that anything was
wrong, looked over Alvord's balance and
soon found several discrepancies. He was
on the point of leaving matters for Al
vord's adjustment when he decided to
make a further examination and soon saw
that many items had been deliberately
falsified.

THERE Is every Indication that the
Sacretary of State's office In Sac
ramento is permitting a "draw
down" on the official ballots. Let
ters have been written to the
county officials, bearing the signature of
C. F. Curry as Secretary of State, in
which the price charged for the ba,llot
paper, size 15x25, is $2 50 per ream. The
paper is all of one sort. On the scales a
ream is found to weigh Just twenty
pounds, so that the price is 12^ cents per
pound. There is some stir about the mat
ter among county officials already, for the
same quality of paper can be procured in
the open market at 6 cents per pound.
This fact was determined by a Call re
porter' yesterday, when armed with a
piece of the ballot paper, the water mark
being torn oft that there might be no
clew to guide paper dealers to the object
of the inquiry, he. made the rounds among
reputable paper selling houses.
Inquiry has determined the fact that all
the counties in the State, including San
Francisco, have been made to pay 12H
cents per pound for the official ballot
paper, which differs from paper to be
found in paper houses only in the water
mark or "dandy," the cost of which does
not figure. Registrar Walsh showed a let
ter he had received from the Secretary of.
State's office making the price mentioned.
Other letters have also been exhibited.
In addition to the difference in the price
there Is another objectionâ the size of the
paper. It is large enough to, get out one
ballot, but not two simultaneously. The
Secretary' of State's office originally noti
fied county officials that there were two
sizes, 15x25 and 18x25. The last mentioned
size is large enough to get out two ballots
for the counties in the interior, but not for
San Francisco. Several requests have
been made of the Secretary of State to
furnish the 15x25 size, but there has been
no compliance with the request. The small
size has caused waste and also higher
bills to be paid by the counties.
There are about 800,000 ballots for the in
terior, as computed. To make these It
took 1G0O reama of ballot paper of the
small size, the cost of which was $4000.
The large size paper would supply the
necessary number of ballots at a cost of
$2400, the price of the larger size being $3
per ream, if it could have been procured
by the counties. There is a difference of
$1600, outside of San Francisco, against the
counties and in favor of some on% else
because of using the small paper. To this,
to estimate the size of the rake
off that the interior pays, must be
added the difference in the price
of the paper as . charged against
the counties and the open market price,
which amounts to $96S, counting the dif
ference at 6^ cents per pound. The addi
tional cost outside of San Francisco is
$2568, without counting the extra press
work made necessary by the fact that
only one ballot can be run on the paper at
one time. To this must also be added the
difference in price on the paper furnished
to San Francisco. The quantity is 290
reams and the quantity in weight 5S.O0O
pounds. The difference in price against
the county Is $377.
These are small pickings, but they alto
gether amount to a draft against the tax
payers in one item of $3945 directly.

b^en greatly reduced. Eight hundred
schools are now in operation, with 36,000
pupils, and organization has been effected.
Money Is necessary to execute this plan,
and It is hoped to secure for this purpose
what remains of the $2,000,000 appropriated
for Porto Rico before the tariff bill was
enacted. The Government of Porto Rico
is as solvent ns any bank, he said, and
no debt is contracted until the money Is
available to net it. The people as a class
are rager for <K!ucation and are accepting
all the opportunity afforded them. The
duties on imports from the United States
for the first week of October exceeded
the total trade of the trnlted States with
the island for a whole year under Spanish
dominion, showing the opening of an Im
portant market.
Mr. Brumbaugh said conditions in Porto
Rico are steadily improving. There ie
much Interest and considerable excite
ment over the first election. The contest
has <2ev^loped tines similar to those in the
United States. The Republican party is
In full harmony with President McKinley
and for the American administration,
v hile the Federal party within the past
two weeks has indorsed Bryan and de
c'.ared for Porto Rican and against Ameri
can administration. The latter party em
braces the pro-Spanish clement, he said,
and the former the great industrial

WICHITA, Kans., Oct. 26.-Rev. W. S.
Mayse, who came to Wellington, a small
town near here, from Los Angeles two
year3 ago, has been dismissed â¢ as pastor
of the Wellington Presbyterian Church
for eloping with and ruining a 13-year-old
girl who sang in his choir. His wife is
almost Insane and the minister has dis
appeared. Rev. Mr. Mayse and his wife
seemed to live happily and their home
was one of the brightest In Wellington.
Mayse increased interest in the Presby
terian church as It had never been be
fore, and to the detriment of other
churches. He paid close attention tp Jes
sie Jones, only 13, but pretty, tall and re
fined.' Her parent? were pillars in the
church and she sang in the choir. .Under
the pretext of teaching her to sing, Mayse
became on friendly terms with the girl
and their friendship grew apace. The girl
.told some -friends the new preacher was
going to create a sensation. Last month
they ran away, going .to Â¦ Chicago. The
girl returned alone, sorrowful for her fool
ishness. She accused , the pastor of hav
ing ruined her life and hypnotized her Into
loving and having eloped with him.
A few weeks ago he turned up to find
the Wellington church had preferred
charges against him before, the Kansas
synod, and refused to allow him inside
the church. He appealed to the synod,
but yesterday it expelled him. He haa
been hiding for a week and the church
deacons are unable to tell where he ig.

riously 111 at his .Jackson-street home.
Three days ago he suffered a stroke of
paralysis, which has affected his 'entire
left side, depriving him of the use of his
left arm and left Teg-. While his illness is
severe it is not considered to be neces
sarily dangerous. If Mr. Sanderson does
not suffer a second stroke his physicians
have hope that in two weeks he will be
thoroughly recovered.
Some time ago he felt that his system
had run down, and under medical advice
he went to the country to seek health
The journey appeared to benefit him. but
on his return he was stricken. He is the
possessor of a strong- constitution, how
ever, and every hope is given for his re

CHINESE THEATER IN
THE CHURCH PARLORS
The fear expressed that American-born
Chinamen may return to China and bring
back with them female slaves in larsv
numbers, either as real or pretended
wives. Is said not to be well founded. The
Call placed a quietus on the Importation
of Chinese women slaves at this port two
years ago and the only way by which
they have been enabled to get into Cali
fornia is by entering: at a Brtiish port,
paying the' head tax and being smuggled
over the border.
The Federal authorities at this port pro
pose to exercise .the greatest vigilance In
the matter and attempts at imposition will
be severely punished.
Much Speculation Concerning- a Re
cent Decision of the Secretary
of the Treasury.
Borne comment was excited in the Cus
tom-house yesterday â¢ by the telegram
from Washington published by The Call
to the effect that the Secretary of the
Treasury had decided that the Chineee
wife of an Amertcan-born Chinaman was
entitled to land in this country by rea
son of such relationship. It was the gen
eral ooinion that the decision could not
have been otherwise, for a Chinaman
born In this country not the offspring of
a Consul or. Embassador Is an American
citizen and,' under the provisions of th<*
constitution of the United States, is en
titled to all. the rights and privileges of
citizens.

The third of the course of eight lectures
Professor Charles Mills Gayley ot the
University of California is delivering to
the ladles of the Charming Auxiliary was
delivered yesterday in the parlors of tho
First Unitarian Church at Geary and
Franklin streets.
Professor Gayley took for his subject
"Some Women Poets," namely Mrs.
Browning, Christina Rossetti, Augusta
Webster and Emily Dickinson.
Mrs. Browning Professor Gayley classed
as incomparably the greatest woman poet
of the century- In definition of the term
feminine poetry Professor Gayley said:
"By feminine poetry I do not mean
poetry written by women, but poetry of
an extremely emotional character. Ten
nyson, Shelly and Keats wrote feminine
pottry. Robert Browning was the most
masculine of this century poets.
"Read Augusta Webster," said Profes
sor Gayley; "she is the great humani
tarian poet of the century. By her the
puls>e of suffering humanity was most
truly read. She is little known, but some
day she will take up her niche, in the
Temple of Fame."
Christina Rossettl's poetry was classed
as "prattle." "She rarely rises from the
earth," said the lecturer, "and when she
does It Is but a short flight."
The next lecture will take place on Fri
day, November 2, at the Unitarian church
parlors. The subject will be "Some Poets
of Humor and Society."

sents to us a picture of persistent perse
verance In the face of what would have
seemed to an ordinary man insurmount-'
able difficulties. With him, however, It
was differentâ the thought of the holy
end for which he was striving. The ex
traordinary good the accomplishment of
his purpose would bring about urged him
on through all the trials which beset him
to a glorious termination of his life work."

STARTS WITH A COLD.
Catarrh Is a Lingering Cold Which
Refuses to Yield to Ordi-
nary Treatment.
Catarrh usually starts with a cold in
the head and it left unchecked In thl3
climate rarely gets well of Itself.
As fresh cold is taken the disease
Bpreads. getting: deeper and deeper, creep-
Ing along: the mucous membranes from
nose to throat, from throat to windpipe,
from windpipe to Dronchial tubes and
from bronchial tubes to lung cells.
The mucous membranes all connect, one
with another. Hence It Is easy to spread
from one part to another lined with this
same membrane. This is why catarrh In
the head soon affects the throat and fin-
ally the stomach itself, bringing on
chronic catarrh of the stomach, which id
a most obstinate form of dyspepsia.
Everybody Is now well agreed that ca-
tarrh is a blood disease and not a local
one, and the attempt to cure by local ap-
plications simply gives temporary relief
from the purely local symptoms without
the remotest effect In staying the pro-
gress of the disease.
There is a new preparation recently of-
fered to the public that is apparently
destined to do away with every other form
of catarrh treatment.
This new remedy Is not a secret patent
medicine, but Is a large, pleasant tasting
tablet composed of Sauguinaria. Eucalyp-
tol. Gualacol. Hydrastin and other valu-
able and harmless specifics, which are
taken Internally and seem to have a re-
markably beneficial ettect upon the blood
and mucous membranes, apparently
eliminating the catarrhal poison from the
whole system.
These tablets, while being pleasant, con-
venient and absolutely safe to U3e, have
made cures In long standing cases of
catarrh that are little short of marvelous.
They are sold by druggists under thu
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and
any catarrh sufferer who has tried
Inhalers, lotions. ointments, salves
etc.. - and realized their Incon-
venience and uselessness, will fully
appreciate ths difference between a mere
palliative and a permanent cure after giv-
ing Stuart's Catarrh Tablets an Impartial
trial.
All drugglstB sell them at 5o cents for
full sized package and no matter where
lh<? catarrh is located, in the hÂ«?ad. throat
lungs or stomach, Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets will surprise you with t..e effective
results of even a few days' use.

The Early English Comedy.
Before discussing the English comedy it
will be necessary to define another ele
ment of the ludicrous â that of mere fun.
A man may be a comic writer without be
ing either a humorist or a wit.- This ele
ment is the whole stock in trade of the
variety theater, the Sunday newspaper
writer and the professional funny man
who is content "to grin through a liter
ary horse collar of slang and bad spelling"
and raise laughter by mere grotesqueness.
Such humor consists largely of capers and
contortions of the mind and body, of ca
ricature, of practical jokes and horseplay.
The humorist says, "Laugh with me"; the
clown says, "Laugh at me."
This variety is the most primitive and
elementary of all humor. With savages
and rude people generally It is the chief
source of merriment. From the days of
the court jesters to the days of the circus
clown It has been exceedingly popular.
Children, and even grown people, laugh
immoderately at the capers of Punch and
Judy, and the fun culminates when the
little tyrant unmercifully beats his wife.
In the early English comedy the ludi
crous element came largely from this
source. There are traces of U even in the
miracle plays of the middle ages. In the
play of Noah's flood, for Instance, the
wife of the patriarch refuses to leave her
circle of gossips and go into the ark.
After a lively debate, during which Noah
gets decidedly the worse of the argument,
he seizes a stick and with the aid of Shem,
Ham and Japheth he succeeds in beating
her into the place of safety. This was
good fun for the rude spectators, and they
roared with merriment.
In the dramatic Interludes Introduced
by Heywood in the time of Henry VIII
the element of fun predominates. Not
only is there an abundance of buffoonery
and mere horseplay, but there is a con
stant running fire of coarse Jokes,
ludicrous allusions, puns and droll rail
lery. In "The Four P's." a Palmer, a
Pardoner, a 'Potlcary and a Peddler, after
each had unmercifully rallied the others
on their professions, they Indulge in a
lying contest. In which the Palmer easily
wins, for he declares:
Yet have I seen many a mile
And many a woman In the while.
Not one good city, town or borough
In Christendom but I have been through-
And this I would you should understand
I have seen women five hundred thousand.
Yet in all places where I have been.
Of all the women that I have seen.
I never knew, upon my conscience,
A single woman out of patience.
The early comedy that of all others is
most typically English In its sense of
humor Is "Gammer Gurton's Needle."
written about 1562. Here we have for the
first time all the elements which go to
make up a true English comedy. The
later humorous drama became more re
fined and artistic, and it added other ele
ments, but In each case the Innovations
were adaptations from foreign models.
Comic charactoriiatlon was brought in by
imitators of Plautus and Terrence. In the
hands of some playwrights the characters
became mere caricatures. In later years
Ben Jonson made the comedy of comic
situation. He It was who first marked hta
characters with certain traits which they
are forever displaying. One character has
a peculiar phrase which he constantly re
peats In all situations: another Is forever
eating; the miser prates of nothing but
gold; the hypocrite Is everlastingly whin
ing; never for a moment can we lose sight
of the trade marks. This is mere fun. The
best of Jonson's skillfully planned situa
tions are also nothing but mere fun.
"Gammer Gurton's Needle," with all of Us
coarseness and crudeness and buffoonery,
contains more genuine humor than do all
of the plays of this skillful playwright.
Jonson waa a consummate master of plot
and of comic characterization, but, lack
ing the element of humor, his plays are
read only by special students.
The true comedy must combine wit and
fun and humor. It must sparkle with hits
and repartee; It must have for variety a
goodly amount of the merely comic, and
ft must send its roots deep into the allu
vium of human 'nature. Aside from
Shakespeare, few dramatists have made
this happy blending, and that is why.
aside from the great master's work, there
are few great English comedies.
Elizabethan Wit and Humor.
In the age of Elizabeth the English na
tion, after a long and troubled childhood,
entered upon its period of early manhood.
It awakened all at once, aa every youth
does, to a full realization of its powers
and Its possibilities. It waa teeming with
animal life; it was full of the joy and the
hope of mere healthy physical existence;
It ran wildly into every excess; it dreamed
romantic dreams; it saw visions; It bub
bled over with glad songs. It was an era
of intense intellectual activity. "The very
air of London." says Tyler, "must have
been electric with the dally words of
those immortals whose casual talk upon
the pavement by the streetslde was a
coinage of speech richer, more virile.
more expressive than has been known on
this planet since the great days of Athe
nian poetry, eloquence and mirth."
It was the golden era of English wit
The Queen, who was the center and. soul
of the age. waa a peerless mistress of
word play and epigram and repartee. A
nimble wit was a sure passport to her fa
vor; her court became a fencing ground
where quick retort and brilliant word
thrust and parry made up much of the
conversation. The royal wit spared no
one. The Bishop of London, who doubt
less never had seen the royal wardrobe,
discoursed before her on the vanity of
dress. "Let him beware." she cried, "or
I'll fit him for heaven, and he shall- walk
thither without staff or mantle." Spain
sent Don Guzman as Embassador to her
court and she sent In return Mr. Mann,
remarking slyly: "The Spaniards send a
goose-man; I will send a man who is a
goose." A noble who had offended her
begged for mercy. "The Hon." waa her
answer, "never injures mice and other
vermin." Her wit plays through all of
her letters and papers. Parliament, ex
ceedingly anxious to know her intentions
as to marriage, demanded of her an an
swer, but her answer gave little light.
"Were I to tell you that I do not mean
to marry, I might say less than I Intend;
and were I to tell you that I do mean to
marry. L might say more than It Is proper
for you to know; therefore, I give you an
answer answerless."
No one more keenly relished a Jest, but
there were times when jesting was dan
gerous. Harrington one morning would
ask of her a favor, but a glance at her
face sent him away with the remark: "I
will not adventure her Highness* choler
lest she collar me also"â a joke more ex
pressive when It was new, since the Queen
when in a fit of rage had once actually
seized upon a nobleman and shaken him
vigorously, naleigh during one period so
influenced Elizabeth that it was whis
pered that he virtually governed the king
dom. Observing them at cards one day.
Tarleton exclaimed: "See how the knave
commands the Queen!"â a sentence that
was his undoing.
But the wit of the period was by no
means confined to the courts. The Inns
and theaters fairly sparkled with word
play and witticisms. Oh, that there had
been a Boswell In the London Inns during
the period when Marlowe and Lodge and
Greene and their troop of merry roister
ers held high carnival; or, again. In the
Mermaid, the Sun and the Triple Tun,
where the merry "tribe of Ben" held
their nightly wit combats. How Beau
mont In later years smacks his lipa In
memory of the old days.
What things have we ten
Done at the Mermaid; heard words that hava

Bo nimble and ao full of subtle flame
As If that every one from whence they came
Had meant to put his whole wit In a jest.
In a single night, he declares, enough
wit was wasted to Justify the whole city
talking foolishly for three days. The soul
and center of the gathering was the pon
derous Ben Jonson, who as Drummond,
his contemporary, observes, was "given
rather to lose a friend than a Jest." But
the nimblest wit of all was Shakespeare.
"Many were tha wlt-oombats between Shake
speare and Ben Jonson." observes Fuller, who
speaks from experience. "I behold them Ilka
a Spanish great galleon and an English man
of-war. Master Jonson. Ilka the former, was
built far higher In learning, solid but slew In
his performances: Shakespeare, uke the latter,
lesser in bulk, lighter in sailing, could turn
with all tides, tack about, and tak* advantage
of all winda by the quickness of his wit and
Invention."
Outside of the Elizabethan drama only
> lew plUXul scraps o{ $& wit, and tumor^
of the age have been preserved. A few
collections of bon mots were attempted.
Lord Bacon complied a collection of
"Apothegms." or witty anecdotes, chiefly
of the ancients. A single one will illus
trate:
"One was saying that his great-grandfataer
and grandfather and father died at sea; said
another that heard him. 'And I were aa you,
1 would never come at sea.' 'Why.' said he.
â¢where did your great-grandfather and grand
father and father dleT He answered: 'Wher
but in their bedsT Saith the other: 'And I
were as you. I would never come in bed.' "
i The best pun in the collection Is un
doubtedly In the anecdote of the sailor
who was tried before the "wise just-as3."
A Jest book entitled "Conceits." pub
lished in 1639, contains many of thÂ© witti
cisms of the period. Here may be found
the bright epigram. "It is better to be
witty and wise than witty and otherwise."
and the story of the man named Gunn
who was advised by the Magistrate be
fore he had been arraigned to give a good
report In the future. Indeed, the ancient
joke books contain many genuine "Joe
Millers" which are even now r-ive and in
circulation.
The greatest body of genuine Eliza
bethan wit and humor Is contained In the
dramas of Shakespeare. Fewartlst3 In
the history of all literature have known
so well as he the secret springs of hu
man mirth. He has mingled in his work
every type of humorous composition. He
ha* used freely the broadly comic ele
ment of the early EngUah comedy. The
"Comedy of Errors," for instance, turn
ins as it does upon a Â«udlcrous confusion
among characters identical in personai
appearance, comes very near to the level
of broad farce. Launcelot in the "Mer
chant of Venice" is a purely comic creat
ure. He raises laughtei by his antics and
his grotesque speeches. Old Gobbo. his
blind father, enters and the clown Imme
diately seizes him and whirls him about
the stage till he loses all sense of direc
tion.
Gobbo. Master young gentleman. I pray you
which is the way co Master JawÂ»?
Launcelot. Turn up on your right hand at the
next turning, but at the next turning
of all on your left: marry, at the very
next turning;, turn of no hand, but turn
down Indirectly to th* JÂ«w*s bouse.
Gobbo. By God's sontles 'twill be a hard
way to hit.
At length Launcelot reveals his identity,
but the old man. sorely confused, wishes
to feel hia face. The clown presents the
back of his head for Inspection.
Gobbo. I'll be a worn If thou be L&uncetot
thou art my own flesh and blood. Lord
worshiped might he be: What a beard
but thou got: Thou bast got more hair
on thy chin than Lwbbla my Oil-horse
has on hla tall.
Launcelot. It should mn then that Dobbin' *
tail grows backward; I am sura ha had
more hair of his tall than I have oÂ£ my
face wten I last saw him.
Gcbto. Lord*, how art thou c&angedl
Shakespeare uses his comic scenes with
exceeding skill. They come ever aa a con
trast. After the reader of "Macbeth" haa
been wrought upon by the murder scene,
that most fear-lnspinug scene in ail lit
erature, he Is aroused all at once by thd
maudlin babblings of the porter at the
gate, who, having "caroused until th<Â»
second cock." is now In a highly exalted
condition. He is porter of hell gate and
he comments in drunken glee on the dif
ferent persons that he is admitting to tha
"everlasting bonfire."
Every play of Shakespeare's, save per
haps "Macbeth," sparkles with wit and
word-play. Punsâ some of them extreme
ly bad onesâ are found everywhere. The
cobbler in "Julius Caesar" is questioned
as to his trade.
Truly, sir. all that I live by Is with the awl;
I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor
woman's matters, but with awl. I am. Indeed.
sir. a surgeon to old shoes: when they ara in
great danger I recover them. As proper men as
ever trod upon neat' a leather hav* gone upon,
my handiwork.
One could hardly open to a pajo of
Shakespeare without finding a pun.
Falstaffâ My honest lads. I will tell you what
I am about.
Pistol â Two yards aad more.
Falstaffâ No quips cow. Pistol; Indeed. X am
la the waist two yards about, but I am now
about no waste; I am about thrift.
Celiaâ I pray you bear with m*. X can go no
further.
Clownâ For my part I bad rather bear with
yoa than bear you; yet I should bear no cross
[a plec* of money] ti I did bear you; for I thin*
you have no money In your purse.
The court fool, that typical product of
the middle ages, furnished Snakespearo
with a vehicle for much fun and wit. In
him we have best illustrated the old idea
of the "wit combat." He is a "wit-snap
per," he must have an answer always
ready and he must keep up smartly the
shuttlecock of badinage and repartee aa
long as possible. The fool in "King Lear"
and "As You Like It" axe well known ex
amples. The grave scene In "Hamlet"
contains one of the beet of these combats.
Hamletâ Â¦Whose grave is mis, airf
Clownâ Mine. sir.
Hamletâ I think It b* tbiae, lndted: for thou
Uest In it.
Clown â You lie out on't. sir, and therefor* it
In not yoara: for my part, I do not lla la"t.
and yet it Is mine.
Hamletâ Thou dost lie In't, to be tn't and say
It Is thine; 'tia for the dead, not for thÂ« quick;
therefore thou Ilest.
Clown â "Tia a quick lie. air; 'twill away agala
from ma to you.
Â¦ Hamletâ What man do*t thou dig it for?
Clownâ For no man, sir.
Hamletâ For what woman, then?
Clown â F*or none, neither.
Hamlet â Who la to be buried la It?
Clownâ One that was a woman, sir; hot. reÂ«t
her soul, she'* dead.
It is the humor of Shakespeare that has
made bis works the Immortal creations
that they are. His characters axe Intense
ly human: they are like living men and
women. We smile at their foibles and
weaknesses, but we feel nevertheless tha
great common bond of human nature that
has made them our brothers. There 13
something to win our sympathies even in
Falstaff. that "great tun of flesh," that
droll, accomplished rascal, whose whole
life was but a round of selfishness and
sensuality. Despite his villainies there Is
not a single reader who knows him that
would wish him punished for his crimes.
There is a moment of real pathos as we
read of his closing hours;
Xay. sure he's not In hell: hÂ»'s In Arthur's
txixm. If ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A'
n*ade a nner end and went away an' it had been
any Christian child; a' parted evsn JuÂ»t between
twelve and one. Â«vea at the turning of the tide;
tor after I saw him fumble with the sheets and,
play with the Cower) and smile upon his fin
gers' end. I knew there was but on* way: for
bis nose was aa sharp as a pen aad a' baobled
of green field*.
Poor Jack. farewelL "We say with ths
Prince: "I could have better spared a bet
ter man." He Is so Intensely human, so
real, ao delightfully characterized, so
truly humorous in every sens* of that
word, that he Is one of the glories of our
literature.
To give samples of Shakespeare's humor
is almost Impossible within narrow limits.
His humor, like all humor, is subtle, per
meating, perfuslve. It spreads through a
whole bcene like a delicate odor through
a room, and one may not say "It Is here."
"It Is tneTe." E>oubtless the most humor
ous scene in all Shakespeare Is the fourth,
scene of the second act of "King Henry
IV." where the old rascal recounts tha
story of his valiant combat with the in
creasl^S number of men In buckram.
When he Is fairly made to realize that the
"two or three and fifty" rogues that set
upon him in the darkneÂ»3, several of
which he succeeded In running through,
were In reality the prince and his compan
ion, from whom, as a matter of fact, he
had run in mortal terror, his presence of
mind does not desert him.
Falstaffâ By the Lord. I knew ym as welt as
he that made ye. "Why. hear yoo, my master*,
was It for mÂ» to kill the heir apparent? Shou-ct
I turn upon the true prince? Why. thou know
est I am as valiant &9 Hercules; but beware In
stinct: the lion will not touch the tne prince.
Instinct is a great matter; I m a coward on
Instinct: I shall think the better of myself and
thefe during my life: I for a valiant lion, ant
thou for a true prince. But. by the Lord, tails,
I am glad you have the money. Hostess. c!ap
to the doora: watch to-alght. pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all th*
titles pf good-fellowship corns to you! what!
shall we bo merry? Shall w* fca.vÂ» a. play ex
tempore?
Princeâ Content: and tha argnmÂ«nt shall bÂ«
thy running away.
Falstaffâ Ah I bo more of that. Hal. Â«n* thou
lores t me.
This Is true humor. It is more than
mere fun. It is more than the mere flashes
of Intellectâ it Is "a touch of nature that
makes the whole world ktn."

SPEAK IN PRAISE OF McKINLEY
FREDERICK W. HOLLS, the dis
tinguished constitutional lawyer
of New York, secretary and coun
sel of the American Embassy to
the Peace Conference at The
HÂ»rÂ«, and Will A. Harris of Los Angel
cÂ«. until four years ago a Democrat, were
tbe epeakers at a great Republican meet
ing at Metropolitan Temple last night
Joseph a Campbell presided aa chair
man of the evening. Assuring the visitor
.rora New York of a hearty welcome to
The coast, he introduced him as the first
fr^Rkpr. Mr. Holls spoke in part as fol
lows:
It has been ray privilege to ascertain by per
e'r.al observance how this country's po'lltlcal
equation is looked upon by foreigners. I have
crten thought it would be of benefit to Amerl
rÂ«n. to ask what an Intelligent foreigner might
Know or America from this the laat Presiden
ral campaign of the nineteenth century. Xo

the nineteenth century with pride. Xo nation
Y.n* made greater progress. When you look
Uck upon events you will see how much we
for which to be grateful.
Now. at the dose of this greal period, what
Â» tne eountx-y a*ked to do? It Is asked to put
t..e seal of disapproval upon the administra
tion to which credit is due for most of that
progress. It is asked to give a vote of no con
n.ienoe m that administration. It is asked to
enliven its financial system, a svstem inter
tw.r.ed with our national honor and national
prosperity. And for what? In order to put

ThÂ» reasons advanced why there rhmiid be
a change of administration are based mainly
on questions connected with our foreign rela
t.'inv When we {.n'.nt to our progress we arÂ»
ti :d there is danger of imperialism undermining
tjic Declaration of Independence. If that were
true I admit that the danger would outweigh
â¢ ny rcinomic question. It is right we should
arceft fuc j ; a challenge.
It :s a curious fact that r.rver before has
â¢ 'i a<Jir.Sr:iFtratic>r'. stood for re-election wh'.ch
haf received Â«w> little rrit:<-;sm. You wi!l find
Â«*at not even the Kar.sas O:tr platform has
Â¦ ny declaration that the administration of do
r.Â«Â»*tic affairs has had anything in it of cor
ruption i r mismanagement.
The nnj'.narv * n rÂ»irn relations have not been
rrs^p j-o rr.urh c s-jbjett or att*rk as the Phil
lrrlne r>cllcv. and vet :hÂ»t record is a r>Â«rt nf
erelimty in the Philippine IMands. To destroy
6o\erelgnty over a large number of people Is
aji act of great responsibility. We assumed
that responsibility before the world, and it
will be a sorry day for America when Ameri
cans come to think lightly of their duty. When
we destroyed Spanish sovereignty in the Phil
ippines it was our duty to put something In
its place. That is Just what we have been
doing Â«ver since.
The dancer of imperialism is real. If we
should find anywhere in this nation a section
dominated by the will of one man; if that one
man should be low and corrupt; if that sec
tion ehould be & great city and its organization
a great factor in national politics, then, my
friends, you have imperialism. You find it
with ilr. Croker and his vile Tammany crowd.
You find it in the men who glory in the fact
that they live by political blackmail, off the
dives of New York City; Jn the. organization
of whJch Mr. Bryan had the effrontery to tell
the people of Syracuse. "Great is Tammany
and Crocker Is its prophet." My friends, ther*
is the <li.r.Â£er of imperialism.
The subject of trusts ig- not brought Into
partisan politics in good faith. I am free to
confers that one of the great questions that
will confront the nation la that of monopolistic
combinations of cap.ial. It is not a party
question. It confronts uo in a manner that
threatens our property rights. In the dark
path of the proper regulation of such com
binations there ha* just one step been taken
that lights it up, and that was taken by our
gallant candidate for Vice President, Theodore
Kocsevelt.
The true lseue in this campaign is Bryanlsm.
It ib the question of whether the people in
tend to rive a vote of no confidence, to take
the government out of the hands of a great
statesman and nut it in the hands cf a mere
politician and rhetorician. If you here in Call
toirr.ia do your duty you will have no occasion
to be ashamed of us in New York.
Tl:e more the questions are Judiciously con
ssdenxl. the more certain I feel that the last
campaign of the century will be a crowning
glory of our history urn! that it will result In

second will be cast or. the 6th of Xovember
next for William McKinley and Theodore
Kooeevclt. My second Republican vote will be
cast with greater pleasure, satisfaction and
confidence than was the first. There is no

his days would have been brighter, his path

jpoken when te wu in the midst of thÂ« na

Forty years from now some of those who ara
denouncing- the present chief magistrate as an
Imperialist and an enemy of his country will
refer to his administration as one of glorious

Bryan reaches the age of maturity there will
be an imperial army of 50,000 school rnarms in

Bradstreefs on Trade.
The situation In cereals shows little chance.
A feature of the movement of produce to mar
ket at the present time not heretofore noted
this year is the growing scarcity of cars re
ported west of the Mississippi. Sugar Is lower
than anticipated and cofTee Is oft on continued
laige receipts. The strength of demand for
finished products of iron and steel, noted for
some tlms past, finds reflection in an improved
inquiry for the cruder forms at leading iron
certers this week. Steel billets are reported
52 higher at Chicago, while a similar advance Is
noted at Pittsburg, and efforts to raise the
level of Bessemer steel billets are being' de
bated. The claim that stocks are being stead
ily reduced Is borne out by reports of several
loOO-ton lots being moved at Pittsburg and fur
ther west and . Intimations that a Â¦ still larger
business has been arranged for on a conditional
barls dependent upon election results. -While
Southern pig Is . unchanged at the South a
sharp cut In the fame ts noted at Western
markets. The lowering of coal prices, expected
as a result of the ending of the strike, is'ex
ptcted to help the export trade In ecal which
to. however, confronted, with high freight rates.
Despite some irresularitle*, growing out of
the unseasonable weather conditions, heavy
price changes In leading staples or Increased
conservatism In some trader* as the election
approaches, the general business situation as a
whole is encouraging and new elements or man
ifestations of strength, appear from time to
time. Perhaps the most notable feature of the
week Is found In the Industrial situation,
which has been distinctly Improved by the ap
parently official and final action taken toward
ending the anthracite coal miners' strike.' In
view of the fact that moat miners have ob
tained Increased wages the effect on business
in the producing regions can .hardly be other
wise than beneficial while the trade at larue
must reap benefits from the return to normal
conditions. Other lines of trade which showed
Improvement are those of shoe leather and
kindred products at the East, which are reaping
the benetit of better distribution in the country
at large, and rather more than an average busi
ness has been done In wool at the East with
holders more inclined to demand full 'prices
for their products.. The continued .weakness
of cotton Is an element of uncertainty In the
goods trade, but the firmness of these products
in the fact of l%c decline In price Is a tribute
to the strength of the market.

CHICAGO. Oct. 28.â With an . occasional mo
mentary exception trade in wheat was dull
and, of a holiday character, traders beln j In
clined to ex-en up on account of the holiday
trade as well as Saturday. Liverpool' showed
a good response early to the bulg* here yes
terday and December wheat opened %o higher
to He lower- at 73',4o to 73Kc. This initial
showing: was disappointing to the crowd and
the market forthwith took on an easier tone.
Thte feeling was further encouraged by the
excellent weather, the small shipments and
the continued liberal receipts, as well as the
Liverpool loss of Its early gain. Without ma
terial reaction, December declined to 72Vie.
where the market on a demand for export
steadied and rallied fractionally, closing: Tic
under the closing of the previous session, at
72HC.

of new corn, prospects for the early movement

Oats were dull and neglected. December

Provisions started with a show of dullness
because of the advance of prices at the yards
and the poor quality of hogs. Selling by longs,
however, soon turned the scale the other way

NEW YORK. Oct. 28.â The stock market un
derwent mar.y changes of 6entlment to-day, but
on the whole came through the ordeal very
well and tÂ«t average level of prices waa higher
as a result of the <*,iy's trading. The market
â¢jv&e very irregular from the opening and <Jur
ir.g the course of the session the bearish ten
dency fairly get the upperhand. carrying
prices to wr.Il below last nisht's le\-el. The
extreme rar.se In the most active stock was
from 1 to over 2 points, but the final rally
reduced net changes In nearly every case to
Email fractions. The weakness which over
came the market was clearly enough an In
cident of the digestion of profit*. The force
of the final rally showed the professional oper
ators \-entured to sell shorts pretty freely also.
Wa3 street had its d?.lly report this morning of.
etupendcus new combinations Jn the railroad
world, this time relating to Southern Pacific.
The Vanderbllt interests, it was said, had se
cured control, and all problems of competition
and rate-cutting were forthwith to be. settled.
But in Southern Pacific enormous blocks of long
etock came out. succeeding a primary Bale of
10.000 shares at quotations Vi point apart. The
opening quotation waÂ» the highest of the day
and the stock fell away lÂ«i during the active
filing; movement. Brooklyn Transit was ao
tively dealt in and was pushed up 1% before
marked signs of weakness began to develop.
These points of strength served to sustain the
market somemhax. but realizing continued on
an active scale. A number of the iron and steel
fclTks declined from 1 to l'.Â± points.
The fall In the call money rate to 2 per cent
and the manifest relaxation in the pressure
to reaJlze encourae*d the advance. The call
money market relieved apprehension and sug
gested the inference that the banks must have
further contracted their loans so as to re
duce the reserve requirements during the week
Only about *4.O00.CCO of gold of the Jll 000 000

NEW YORK. Oct. 26.â Bradstreefa financial
review to-morrow will say:
At the end of last night It was apparent
some large financial and speculative Interests
wero taking an aggressive position on the bull
aide of the account. This week has witnessed
the development, under such auspices of a r?s
lng market. Transactions exceeded any at
tained in many weeks, and although manipula
tion and speculative activity contributed largely
to the Interest in the proceedings, ther. have
been more evidence of outside interest than
for a long time. Buying of stocks by commi-
slon houses has, In fact, recommenced on a
scale that contrasts sharply with the lack of
any such support to prices for several
months past. London alao has taken a part In
the dernongtration. and though the foreign par
ticipation was mixed in character. Europe was
a considerable buyer of stocks on balance
This, however, does not mean that bullish
speculation in Americans has broken out in
London. On the contrary. It seems to result
from the fact that heavy operators there con
cluded that as a consequence of election un
certainties in this country our market would
break and eold many calls on "Yankee rails "
besides selling them short to a large sum total
This foreign bear Interest was subsequently
alarmed and started to cover extensively there
by helping the advance along. Local bear trad
ers have likewise been obliged to cover in the
stocks of which they were largely short, but it
was also noticeable that the smaller profes
sional was not only prompt to take on the suc
cessive advances In different stocks, but alao
Feemed Inclined to put out freah short sales
In fact, the street as a whole seemed to be Im
pressed with an Idea that before election day
there might be a reaction In prices. r

Bank Clearings.
Failures for the week were 205 In the United
States, against 190 last year and 28 In Canada,
against 27 last year.
Wheat also continued its downward course,
owing to the good news here and abroad, but
an encouraging feature was the accelerated for
eign buying as quotations declined. Atlantlo
exports for the week were 2.935,028 bushels,
against 2,233.625 a year ago, and Pacific ship
ments 879.043 bushels, against 658.583 last year.
Sales of wool at the three chief Eastern mar
kets continue to increase. <?xceedinir five mil
lion pounds last week. Prices are not altered
and blda slightly below the market are refused.
Cotton goods move rather more freely as the
price comes nearer parity with raw materials,
but wide sheetings are dull at the advance to
J2c.
The election means a great deal to all busi
ness lntefbsts and although confidence In the
future. Is seen on every hand, it Is but natural
that men do not care to take unnecessary
chances, and therefore delay new engagements
aa, far as possible until after the ballots are
counted. But contracts for steel raila for the
season : thus far are within 50,000 tons of last
year's heavy bookings and the confidence in an
ultimate, marked Improvement is bo strong that
all raw materials are firm and without any
speculative activity to stimulate them. The
agitation for an advance in billets, though a
small one. is nn indication of what the iron
and steel markets expect in the next six months
and in the great industries sellers of material
could -easily make heavy contracts If they
cared ; to attach political crovialona to their
agreement* However unreasonable featurÂ«a
may be, It Is likely to be better for business In
the loni run that conservative ideas for the
pretent are entertained. The weather over a
great part of the country haa been favorable
for agricultural operations, which are progress
ing well, and la the East the unseasonable tem
pers tures have retarded general trade compara
tively little, as there has been no great stim
ulus yet this season.
Conditions In the iron and steel market stead
ily improve, orders gradually swell in. rolom*
and buyers make less effort to secure conoes
elons. In most cases quotations are not altered,
but there Is an advance to $20 in Philadelphia
for billets, owing to the better businesa In
rails. Pigiron moves freely, especially at Chi
cago, whero manufacturers have contracted
heavily for finished stuff in excess of raw ma
terial on hand. Castiron P'PÂ« ls ln urgent de
mand and new plans for shipbuilding will take
plates. Bridgebullders . are buying structural
forms heavily. Makers of rails and other prod
ucts of iron have been accused of quoting better
terms to foreicn than to domestic buyers. If
this is done it would seem to be the manufac
turers' affairs rather than the newspapers'.
Minor metals are quiet, except for further
weakness In tin. Silver has reached the highest
price in four years.

The report that the Cured Fruit Association
Intended to carry over 1000 cars of email
Prunes Into next season la denied by members
of the combine. Some of the very small sizes,
such as 120s and over, may be worked off to
the brandy distillers. Nor will there bÂ« any
cut In prices, especially as the volume of the
crop is now discovered to be materially smaller
than expected. This ought not to be news
to anybody, for The Call pointed out three
months ago that the crop was not anywhere
near as large as many thought. It has become
the fashion to trumpet "Immense crop" every
euznmer, and it hurts the market every year
to the amount of millions of dollars. But the
same thing will probably be done next year,
and by the very persons most Interested la thÂ»
Industry.

"Duringf the week there have been threw ar

tons; three from Washington, 10,600 tons: two
from Swansea. 6757 tons; five from Australia.
16.4S2 tons; total. 45,415 tons. The generous
deliveries this week will enable the Jobbers
to place some coal in yard, which they have
not been enabled to do for several months past,
as !t has been taken direct from ship's sitle
Immediately on arrival here to consumers.
There have been five cargoes from Australia
thl"j week, whereas none may arrive next week;
all of these now here were placed long since at
prices which cannot now be duplicated. Pres
ent cost of coal and ruling freight rates make
the delivery price here higher than any eon
, Burner la willing to pay. "Washington and
British Columbia collieries are In a position
to Increase their output, so as to meet all
probable requirements locally, provided carriers
shall be obtainable; and thÂ« present outlook
is rather favorable for the Government to re
linquish a number of their steamer transports
this winter.
By estimates carefully made at the local oil
exchange, the amount of crude fuel oil which
will be extracted from wells In California.

2.400. C00 barrels will be produced north of
Tehachapi. and 2.200.0CO barrels south of Te

amount of oil means the displacement of over
930.000 tons of coal for steam uses. Jt will causa

ready possessed one name, a name that
was not at all football like, and his fond
parents decided that one name was not
quite enough for so smart and sturdy a
youngster. The selection of a middle name
bothered them not a little, and at last
Mr. Butler decided that the question of' a
middle name should be left to the rooters
who were to gather last night on the
campus for the purpose of cheering the
freshman team on to victory.
Now, Mr. JJutier is a University of Cali
fornia man clear through. He Is a mem
ber of tha senior class and will graduate
next vear. He is the business manager of
the Daily Callfornian. He is an ardent
football enthusiast, and when he took lit
tle John Butler out upon the campus last
night and asked for suggestions for a mid
dle name it did not take long for the as
sembled enthusiasts to select "California."
It was the most natural thing to do under
the circumstances, for to name the little
fellow after his papa's State, his papa's
college, his papas paper and his papa's
football team.
The assembled rooters thought that the
idea was "Just bully." and the assembled
professors thought that it was "quite ap
propriate," Â«ind the assembled co-eds
thought that he was "just too sweet for
anything." and the townspeople said,
"He's all right: only why didn't you name
him Berkeley?"
So the name was bestowed in the even-
Ing with the great bonfire flickering and
flaring and throwing wierd shadows about,
and the university band playing and the
rooters shouting "California" at the top
of their copper riveted lungs. It is safe
to say that the christening of little John
California Butler w#s absolutely unique.

CITY'S OBLIGATION TO
REPAIR THE SIDEWALKS
Property-Owners Learn They Are Not
Liable for Those Accepted
Before 1871.
The article published in yesterday's
Call calling attention to the fact that the
city has evaded payments for, keeping the
'sidewalks in repair on streets accepted
before October, 1871, caused considerable
inquiry yesterday in the Bureau of
Streets. Chief Deputy Donovan was vis
ited by a number of property owners
whose sidewalks are in need of repair
and who desired the city to do the Work.
Donovan admitted that the expense should
not be borne by the owners, but as no
funds are available and the owners would
be put to long and vexatious delays, they
decided to make the repairs on their own
account. While it is certain that a judg
ment could be obtained against the city
they realize that the expense of litigation
would not warrant them In going to court.

Two Charges of Obtaining Money by
False Pretenses Booked Against
Robert Lange.'
The bogus lottery ticket man who has
been swindling women by pretending that
they had won prizes and getting money
out of them as commission on the pre
tense of 'collecting their winnings- Is Â¦ in
the City Prison. Robert Lange, who,
with' George Green, was arrested by De
tectives Wren, Dlnan and McMahon at
the ferry Thursday morning, has beeu
positively identified by Mrs. Kate Costei
lo, 141 Julian avenue, and by Mrs. McAr
thur, 746 Sixteenth street, Oakland, as th*
man who swindled them. ;
Mrs. Costello bought a bogus ticket and
Iiango called upon her, telling her she
had won a prize of $4000. He got $25 from
her as commission and took her to the
Murphy building, where he lost her. He
also sold a ticket to Mrs. McArthur and
met her at the ferry on September 10,
telling her she had won a prize of $200
He got HO as commission and also lost
her in the Murphy building. He was
booked yesterday on two charges of ob
taining money by false pretenses.
Nothing has so far been found against
Green, but the detectives are. hopeful of
being able to prefer a charge of burglary
against both him and Lange. Green has a
long criminal record and every effort will
be made to hold him.

Barnett was promised a position as Dep
uty Clerk, but for some unexplained rea
son was compelled to wait the better part
of a year before the appointment was
made. He has now held office Just fifteen
months, when the announcement of his
removal comes.
It Is said that, a relative of Mr. Root
will be appointed, and the 'Alameda Coun
ty politicians who made Roofs nomina
tion possible because of Barnett are not
in a friendly frame of mind.
Frank Barnett, one of the political lead
ers of Oakland and the one who has al
ways controlled the Sixth Ward and the
Forty-eighth Assembly District, has been
notified by Supreme Court Clerk Root
that after November 1 his appointment as
Deputy Clerk of the Supreme Court will
be revoked. Mr. Barnett himself admits
this, while refusing to discuss the mat
ter; and the announcement comes as a
great surprise to those who know Mr.
Barnett and the political service that led
to his appointment.
Trowbridge H. Ward, former Supreme
Court Clerk, had moved from Los Ange
les County to Alameda County, a,nd at the
last State convention appeared as a can
didate for his old place, cominy from this
county. Hoot was also a candidate, and
his success depended upon whether he
could split Alameda County. . The defeat
of Dr. George C. Pardee created an Incli
nation to give Alameda County some
thing, and had the county united upon
Ward for Supreme Court Clerk, Ward
would have been nominated. Root was
very anxious to prevent Alameda County
from uniting upon any one. Barnett con
trolled the delegates from the Forty
eighth Assembly District and swung them
to Root. This defeated Ward, ana Root
was nominated when the nomination was
in the hands of Ward had he been able to
keep the delegates from the Forty-eighth
District in line.

The Board of Electricity mot yesterday
afternoon In the Hall of Justice and re
ferred the matter of advertising for pro
posals for supplies to the Board of Super
visors. The employes of the department
were reappolnted for sixty days, pending
examinations by the Civil Service Com
missioners.
The matter of having fire signal
boxes in the various theaters was
discussed at length. The Commissioners
were in favor of having boxes placed in
eide the play houses, so that the Fire De
partment woulJ know where the fire was
Juta as soon as the box was rung in.
Superintendent Hewitt thought that it
would be better to have the boxes placed
outside the theaters. He argued that if
iiis suggestion was adopted one box would
suffice lor two theaters that were close
to each other, such as the Orpheum and
Alcazar, thus saving the department the
extra expense of putting in boxes in each
theater. ., * . ' Â« '
His tuggestion was favorably received,
but on motion of the chairman, definite
fcctlon In the matter was postponed until
the next meeting. *
The Clark tapper system was then takeh
up and thoroughly discussed. As the
members of the board were not ready to
pay whether they deemed It advisable to
purchase the system or build an entirely
rew one, they decided to hold a special
meeting next week and devote the ses
fcion to a -further discussion of the tapper
system.
A communication was received from the
Point Lobos Improvement Club asking
that fire boxes be placed at the following
locations: Point lÂ»bos and Ninth ave
nues; Point Lobos and Thirty-second ave
nues; California street and Tenth avenue;
(California street and Twentieth avenue;
Lake street and Seventh avenue and Lake
street and Thirteenth avenue. The com
munication was referred to the Chief of
the Fire Department and the Superintend
ent of the Department of Electricity.

Mrs. Kinney was about 55 years old.

adults. The young men are machinists
and employes of the Best agricultural
works at San Leandro.

Neighbors were summoned at once and
doctors were called, but it was found that

ing pierced the heart.
Mrs. Kinney had given no warning of
her intended deed. She was Jidt supposed
to hove had any suicidal tendencies, al
though for several months her physical
condition had been bad, and It was sus
pected by her friends that her mind was
slightly unbalanced.
Mrs. Kinney had made deliberate prep
aration for 'death. The rifle she used bo
longed to one of her sons. She got the
weapon, loaded It and then went, to the
sofa in the dining-room. Then, it Is sup
fiosed. she rained the hammer, and press
ng the gun muzzle against her heart,
sprung the trigger with the enn ramrod,
which was found at ner side with the rlile.
The melancholy woman was alone in the
house, her 11-year-old grandson being in
the yard, iie heard the report, ran In to
the hcu?e and found his grandmother's
body on a lounge in the dining-room, the
weapon lying on the floor by her side.
Â¦While despondent from ill-health, Mrs
Mary Kinney, an elderly widow, commic
teu suicide this afternoon by shooting her
self through tho heart with a rifle bullet
at hor home In San Leandro.

ag-e Passengers for Honolulu.
The Pacific Mail Company's City of Pe
king was three hours late in getting away
for the Orient yesterday. Her 100 cabin
passengers were all ready to sail, but over
100 of the 130 Europeans in the Bteerage
would not take passage. Nearly all of
them were bound for the sugar planta
tions on Hawaii and there was a misun
derstanding about, their transportation.
According to their agreements some of
the men paid their own way and some
were forwarded at the expense of the
planters. When a.11 came together on the
Mail Company's wharf there was an in
terchange of notes and then all hands
went on strike. The' Question was argued
f>ro and con for three hours and then the
aborers qjult the wharf In a body and
the Peking went to bea. The* men and
women are of nearly every nationality on
earth, but nevertheless a bond of brother
hood ran through them all and the plan
tations will not see them until the plant
ers come to time. .
Among the cabin passengers on the City
of Peking were Charles T. Wilder, late
Hawaiian Consul General to San Francis
co, and Mr. and Mrs. IX C. Schweitzer.
Mrs. Schweitzer is the daughter of Rabbi
Voorsanger and she and her husband are
on their wedding tour. <
May Be a Suicide.
Edward Barry was discharged from the
United States Coast and Geodetlo Survey
steamer Pathfinder, last week, and his
comrades now fear he has committed sui
cide.
The Pathfinder was formerly under
naval orders, but last month she was
transferred to the Coast and Geodetic
Survey. The crew was given a chance to
remain under the new state of affairs or
receive an honorable discharge. Barry
chose the latter course and was paid off
with $117. He went to the Winchester
House and after getting a room left $70 in
care of Rolken, the proprietor. Barry
went on a spree and yesterday morning
all his clothes, the key to his room and a
receipt for $70 were found on the end of
Howard-street wharf by Officer High
tower. The supposition is that Barry
jumped overboard.
Steamers "Were Barbound.
There were very few arrivals yesterday.
A northwester is blowing up the coast and
vessels cannot get out of the different
ports. The Empire and Arcata are bar
bound at Coos Bay, while the Dispatch
and Fulton can not venture out over the
Columbia River bar. The coasting schoon
ers are all delayed by the gale and in con
sequence it was a very quiet day on the
front. . _
Water Front Hotes.
The steamer Coos Bay did not gtt away
for southern ports until 4 p, m. yesterday.
There was a rush of freight that kept her
several hours behind time.
Captain A. Olsen has taken command of
the schooner J. B. Leeds.
The following has been issued by the
Lighthouse Inspector.
Notice is hereby given that the first-class can
buoy -red and black horizontal stripes, on the
northwest side of the wreck of the ship May
Flint in San Francisco harbor, California, re
cently dragged out of position by a scow, has
been replaced In its original position, about 800
yards NE. % N. from the end of the- Pacific
Mail dock. The buoy is in eleven fathoms of
water.
William Luhrke, a bartender, was ar
rested for obtaining money under false
pretenses . on the front yesterday. He se
cured several boxes of cigars and some
cases of liquors from merchants on the
pretense that they. were for a well known
saloon-keeper. He was locked up in the
Harbor police station.
CITY OF PEKING SATT.B.
She Leaves Behind Most of Her Steer-
THE new steel barkentlne Hawaii,
built at Dumbarton. Scotland, for
Hind, Rolph & Co., is now on her
way to Newcastle, N. S. W., with
a general cargo. At Newcastle
BhÂ» wllf load coal for South America
and from Iquique she will bring a cargo
of nitrate to San Francisco. It was with
no desire to slight the Pacific Coast that
Hind. Rolph & Co. went to England for
their new ship. They wanted vessels and
wanted them immediately for the coast
ing and Australian trade and not a build
er on the coast would accept the contract.
All of them were overiun with work and
from San Francisco to Puget Sound not a
ship builder would look at a contract that
called for delivery in 1300. In consequence
the order for the Hawaii was sent to
Scotland.
The Hawaii Is 206 feet long. 42 feet beam
and 17 feet 9 inches deep. She is com
manded by Captain McLeod, formerly of
the brig Lurline. The donkey engines and
nearly all of the internal fittings of the
ship were built in San Francisco and
shipped to Scotland. The Hawaii will
carry 1600 tons of sugar or l,20u,000 feet of
lumber.

the soldiers who die at the Presidio and
for those shipped home from Manila has
proved entirely too small, and to make
room for the seventy-five bodies still re

necessary to utilize that portion of the
national cemetery that Is now covered
with a growth of timber. A force of men
has been at work during the last few days
removing the trees. To utterly destroy
the growth a charge of powder Is placed
under the roots and set off. It is expect
ed that the acre of ground covered by the
trees will be cleared within the next few
weeks, and that the Interrupted weekly
funeral processions will be resumed.

tickets have been accounted : for."
