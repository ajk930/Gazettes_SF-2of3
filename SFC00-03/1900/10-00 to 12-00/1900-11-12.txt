CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 1Lâ
Have the carefully guarded secrets of thÂ«
French Wax Office been revealed to the
United States? This Is a question which
le being asked In Washington to-night,
as the result of a publication this morn-
Ing of Information that an agent of the
United States War Department had ob
tained such exact and detailed knowledge
of the plans for the new French field gun
as to enable him to build such a gun for
the United States.
General Andre will probably be called
In the French Chamber of Deputies to
tell what he knews of the plans having
been obtained by Americans.
It Is probable that the guns have been
so made that no one workman knows the
whole secret. Whenever the weapons
have been taken out in maneuvers they
have been carefully covered. Every pre
caution, in fact, supposedly had been
taken to prevent any country from learn
ing this most precious secret of the War
Office. *
It was a genuine surprise even in
France three years ago when the Min
ister of War announced that the army
had been practically rearmed and ita
field artillery was superior to that of any
country in the world.
No secret In the French military history
has been so closely guarded as that of
the new field gun. The first knowledge
that such a gun had been perfected came
when the details of the Dreyfus trial
were made public and it was learned that
ths principal charge against the lieuten
ant was that he had offered to sell the
plans of the "120 court," the technical
name for the weapon.

that the apportionment of Represent

army reform of a very sweeping
character will come Into opera
tion early next year.
"The scheme," says the Daily Mail,
"will make the British private a trained
soldier. Instead of a system giving the
recruit mainly a housemaid's work and
allowing no more than six weeks of mili
tary training, he will in future get ten
months' scientific drilling, all fatigue and
orderly duties being performed by a spe
cial corps of time-expired men.
- "The first four months will be devoted
to company training, including scouting,
entrenching, bridging and taking cover.

Young Man Shoots Wife in Mexico
and Flees Into Arizona.
NOGALES, Ariz., Nov. 11.â About a
week ago a young man by the name of
Rusk arrived In Nogales from Tucson
with a woman, supposed to be his wife.
To-night at 8:30 o'clock as a large num
ber of citizens were awaiting the arrival
of the southbound train they were
startled by a pistol shot from the Mexi
can side, followed by a woman's screams.
A man was seen running for the Ameri
can side, pursued by a mounted Mexican
policeman, who fired several shots at
him. The fus-ltive, who proved to be
Rusk, had stepped up to his wife while
she was walking with a lady friend and
shot her dead. Rusk reached the Ameri
can side and concealed himself.
\. Half an hour later he was again discov
ered and chased down the principal streets
of Nogales, Ariz., by. police officers, who
fired several shots at him before he sur
rendered and. was placed â¢ In Jail ; on the
American side. The tip of his finger was
shot away. He had been drinking all day
but the cause of the shooting is not
yet, known. , . , :

RECEIVED IN MANILA
No Change in the Situation Exhlb-

the Filipinos.
MANILA, Nov. 11.â The result* of the
election ln the United States has been
quietly received here. So far as the Fill

in the situation has resulted, nor is 'any
likely to occur in the Immediate future.
They are for the greater part non-com

work Us way through the armed insur

that Mr. Bryan would certainly be elected
must first be overcome.
Last week's scouting resulted in several
minor engagements with what the official
reports described as "small casualties,"
namely, four Americans killed and ten
wounded.

PLANS FOR INCREASING
STRENGTH OF REGULAR ARMY
Senator Proctor Confers With Corbin
Relative to Needed Legis
lation.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â Senator Proc-
tor of the Senate Committee on Military
Affairs, and Adjutant General Corbin nehl
an Informal conference with. the President
yesterday relative to legislation to asl:
of Congress In connection with the pro
posed Increase of the regular army.
"Under the existing law." said Senator
Proctor, at the conclusion of the confer
ence, "the present strength of the army.
65,000 regulars and 35,000 volunteers, will
e 5f2nJi Ccd on the & rst da >' of next July
to 27.000 regulars. This Is an absurdlv
small number and Congress will be aske'l
by the President to reorganize tho army
upon a larger basin. It will be impossible
to keep any troops In the Philippines un
less the army la increased, to say noth
ing of the garrisons for the forts In this
country.
"My own Judgment is that Congress will
provide a regular army of about 55,000 or
60,000 men, with discretion to the Presi
dent to raise the total to 100,000 if he flnda
the larger number necessary. I have no
doubt that this legislation will be en
acted at the coming session."

NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â The Journal has
the following from Bristol. R. L: De
signer Nat Herreshoff is still at work oti
plans and specifications for the 1901 cup
defender.
The model for the syndicate has been
completed, the general design having been
worked out some time before In a minia
ture plan, and orders have been given
within the past ten days for sufficient
bronze for the underbody and top sides
and enough lead, added to the stock In
hand, for a bulbed fin keel.
Whether the contract has yet been mada
for steel frames cannot be learned nor is
It likely to be known before some material
arrives. While it Is generally believed
here that the new yacht will show marked.
Improvement in speed over the Columbia
nothing definite' has been learned con
cerning the designers' general plan. Those
most conversant with Captain Nat's prac
tice believe that his experience with 10
footers which were modeled somewhat
after the Columbia, with such improve
ments as time had suggested, has led hhn
to adhere to that type for the new de
fender's lines.
None believes that the next cup cham
pion will be much beamier or longer over
all than the Columbia, while the midship
section is likely to be flatter and the
bilges more rounded.
This plan, it is asserted, would give
more speed on the same water-line length
and sail area, the Herreshoffs not taking
kindly to "clouds" of canvas. -;Â¦ : .

In the habit of keeping his valuables in
a grip In his apartments. Some days ago
a Japanese servant was employed. He
went to work with unusual vim and
activity and cleaned tho rooms as they
were never cleaned before. In the room
of the proprietor he found a valise full
of papers, some diamonds and other val

the Japanese servant went his way the
next day the valuables also disappeared.
The police were notified, but the Jap

Powell does not accuse him of having
taken the gems and the papers, but he
believes there Is a strange coincidence.
The value of the stolen property, apart
from the papers which are of no value ex

KILLS HUSBAND
DENVER, Nov. 11. â Three negroes who
had worked with a section gang just pre
vious to the murder of little Louise Frost
several days ago were arrested on sus
picion here to-day. A' rigid' "sweatbox"
examination failed to elicit even a reply
as to their names. They are being held
for further investigation.
LIMON. Colo.. Nov. 1Lâ Search for the
murderer of Louise Frost was continued
to-day. The town was divided into dis
tricts and a search was made of every
house, barn and ou.tbuildJng in the place.
The deputies were divided into four
squads, beginning at the outskirts and
working toward the center. Before tho
seach was continued thirty minutes a
squad in charge of Deputy Elmer Bloss
discovered the remains of a lire where
clothing had been burned. Sheriffs Frea
man and Goddard and Chief of Police
Henry of Colorado Springs made a thor
ough examination of the ashes and found
the buttons of a coat, pants and a suit
of underclothing and other evidence suffi
cient to recognize the owner of the cloth
ing, although his name will not be made
known until an arrest can be made. Latar
a pair of shoes were found which showed
bloodstains, although they had been cov
ered with a coat of grease.
Subsequently the officers found a trail
g-oing to the place and the shoes fitted the
tracks exactly. The same tracks vrcr'i
found coming toward Llmon, evidently at
a run, and they are believed to have been
made by the same shoes, by this the siu
pect Is believed to have hidden in thj
lane. in. the afternoon, as he cannot be
accounted for at the time of the murder,
and then returned, changed clothes and
joined in the search with the others. He
had left town when this evidence was
found, but the officers Â¦ have him located.
Excitement Is gradually subsiding and
it Is thought that all suspects can be
kept at Hugo In safety and that no lynch
ing will occur unless positive evidence
can be secured or a confession extorted.
Sheriff Goddard of El Paso County, Chief
of Police Henry of Colorado Springs an.i
Sheriff J. W. Freeman are directing the
search. To-night the force was augmented
by Marshal Camp and a detective from

\v^Siil_\uTON, Nov. 11.â It Is reported
in tin? cologne Gazette that the powers
have reached a detinite understating in
regard to China. Its terms, as stated by
that newspaper, omit several features
which have been a source of discussion
among them. Probably the most import
ant oi these Is the proposition to abolish
tne cumbersome ortlce of the Tsun-li
Yamen, or Board of Foreign Affairs, and
place the duties of that body under the
supervision of one person, who shall be
directly responsible for the management
of its affair*. This change has been
urgently desired by our Government, and
is believed to find a hearty second among
all the powers. Officials profess an un
willingness to discuss with any detail the
existing state of negotiations now In
progress, and the impression prevails that
Jf an agreement has been reached it is
incomplete or partial.' Nothing camo

PEKING, Nov. 9.â The Emperor is now
at SI Gonan-Fu, two days by telegmph
from here, via Shanghai. Governor Yu
Hsian has recovered from his attempted
suicide at Tai Yuan.
Prince Chlrig and Li Hung Chang, In de
fense of their own positions as peace
makers, are pressing the Dowager Em
press for the execution of guilty Princes
and Ministers, as demanded by the foreign
powers. Probably more suicides will re
sult.
All who participated in the punitive ex
pedition to Paoting-Fu have returned ex
cepting the Germans and French, who re
main as a permanent garrison. The pro
vincial treasurer, one general ami a
colonel, who were found by court-martial
responsible for the slaughter of seventeen
American and English missionaries and
torturing four others who were rescued
alive, were to-day shot, with twenty prom
inent Boxers, with the approval of Field
Marshal Count von Waldersee. Punish
ment was also inflicted en route on other
notorious Boxsr strongholds.
In this just punishment for frightful
atrocities on American missionaries and
native Christians the United States took
no part. The 1500 American troops re
mained idle In camp here.
ITALIANS SURROUNDED.
Party of Sixteen Cut Off by Boxers
in Paoting-Fu Province.
NEW YORK. Nov. 11.â The Journal has
the following from Paotlr.g-Fu, via Taku
and Shanghai: In the western hills of
this province a company of sixteen Italian
soldiers are reported to be surrounded by
Boxers, who threaten the foreigners with
death unless they surrender at once.
The report has just reached here, anJ
has spread consternation among the for
elgn settlers. Immediately upon receiv
ing the report a company of British caval
rymen started to the rescue. They hopÂ»
by rapid riding to reach the hills in time
to save the Italians.
On October 23 there was a sharp engage
ment between British cavalry and a large
number of Boxers. The battle took p*ace
twenty-eight miles northeast of here, and
the Englshmen are reported to have
fought desperately. A large number or'
Boxers were killed in the engagement and
two Englishmen were wounded. There
were no other casualties.
CHINESE EXECUTED.
Punishment Meted Out to Officials for
Inciting Rebellion.
PEKING. Nov. 10.â A profound impres
sion was produced upon the natives at
Paotlng-Fu by the execution there of the
three officialsâ Tien Tung, provincial
treasurer: General W"*ishung Hong and
Colonel Kiuâ who were condemned by the
International court-martial as among
those responsible for the massacres there.
They were beheaded and their heads
were exposed on poles for a day before
burial.
It Â» Is probable, despite discrepancies;,
that the foregoing officials are identical
with those referred to in a disDatch to
the Associated Press from Tientsin dated
November 6. which said:
"Ting Yung, acting Viceroy of Chill; the

SAN RAFAEL. Nov. ll.-Three un
known graves on a steep hill above a
shrimp fishing camp on Point San Pedro
were visited to-day by Deputy Coroner
Stephen Eden, who vas guided to the spot
by Isaac Smith. The graves were found
to be covered with only a few inches of
earth Upon digging down with a crowbar
a crude casket was uncovered This wni
found to contain the remains of a human
being. The feet and a portion of the lower
limbs were exposed. From the condition
of the body Mr. Eden thought that it had
been buried several weeks. The next
grave was also found to contain human
remains Mr Eden did not prospect Tur

tools or sufficient help to carry the bodies

To-morrow an attempt to clear th<Â» nw<u
tery will be made and a strong effort nut
forth to ascertain who was buried how
they died and why they were so secretlT

covery is expected to lead to many more
finds of a similar character in that local
ity. About two weeks ago a Chinaman
ran away from one of the shrimp camps.
He ran over the hills and alonir the rnnn

depot he threw himself in front of a- train

was pulled, from the rails by Thomas J.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Nov. 11.â The greatest mining
project now being carried out in the
Northwest is the big Palmer Mountain
tunnel In Okanogan County, which Is
ij driven into Palmer Mountain 8400
. through 1400 acres of mineral-bearing
ground owned by the Palmer Mountain
Gold Mining and Tunnel Company. The
tunnel is in nearly 4000 feet as a result
of five years' continuous work. It Is be
ing run to crosscut thirty parallel veins
which show upon the surface of the south
stope of Palmer .Mountain.
But little attention was paid to the
veins crossed until the twelfth ledge was
encountered. This was a little over 1300
feet from the portal of the tunnel and
proved to be a ledge forty-two and a half
feet In width between walls, carrying
thirty feet of mineralized formation in
which iron sulphides predominated.
Between the two thousand and three
thousand foot marks twelve more veins [
varying from two to sixteen feet in width
were crossed. This makes twenty-four
veins found so far.
From the 2000-foot mark to the present
face of the tunnel little ore has been en
countored, nor was it expected that it
would be, from the character of the sur
face of the ground, but the tunnel is now
reaching another highly mineralized sec
tion, as shown by the surface choppings.
During the past two months considerable
drifting has been done upon various veins,
which has been very satisfactory, and the
mine, or twenty-four mines, as it might
be called, has now arrived at a point
Â¦where the company Is ready to decide
upon the adoption of a treatment plant
and everything necessary for the mining
and milling of the ores.
To improve the water power and erect
such a plant as the needs of the property
requires will be the work of at least
twelve to eighteen months. With a view
of bringing in the machinery as cheaply
at. possible a preliminary survey will soon
be started from the mine to the Okano
gan Kiver. so that if the Great Northern
or Northern Pacific railroads do not build
to Loomis the coming year the company
will begin construction of an electric road.
REFUSES TO CONSENT TO
BUBIAL OF HER SON
Mrs. Hunter Believes He "Will Return
to Life and Is Arrested for
Insanity.
TACOMA. Nov. 11.â The arrest to-day of
Mrs. Emily Hunter for Insanity brings to
light a peculiar story. Two weeks ago
her ten-year-old son died, but the body
remains unburled because Mrs. Hunter
believed he would return to life and re
fused to allow any one to touch It except
for embalming purposes. The first two
nights after the child died she slept with
tho corpse. The next day possession of
the body was secured while she was at a
neighbor's house. Her other son, aged
11 is very sick, and It was for the pur
pose of Baving this child's life .that Mrs.
Hunter's sister to-day secured her arrest.
While refusing to permit the burial of
her dead son. Mrs. Hunter also neglected
to properly care for her living son. who is
sick with pneumonia. She has- possessed
the belief that some one Intended taking
the boy from her and has kept moving
him from here to Seattle and back for a
week past.
Two years ago Mrs. Hunter lost her
home on a mortgage. Rather than va
cate, she set fire to the house. She was
subsequently examined for insanity and
released. To-morrow she will be taken
to an asylum.

KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Nov. 11.â County
Prosecutor Yates announces that he will
dismiss the celebrated case against James
Redmond, charged with beinj? one of the
principals in the murder of Emma Schu
macher, who was robbed and ir-rdered by
two men in a grocery store In this city
on the night of December 8, 1897. This
action Is due to the lack of evidence
caused by the death of William Handy,
an old negro, who was the most Important
witness for the State and at whose house
Kedmond sought shelter on the night of
the crime.
Jack Kennedy, who figured In several
train robberies In this vicinity, was ar
rested with Redmond, but Kennedy was
sentenced to serve seventeen years in the
penitentiary for train robbery before he
could be tried for murder. Kedmond es
caped and after many daring experiences
with Federal and State officers he waa
rearrested August 16, 1&9S, in the Philip
nines, where he had served as a private
in an American regiment. During the
Santiago campaign Redmond served under
Roosevelt In the Rough Riders.
James Hardy and Elmer Miller Found
Not Guilty of 'Murdering Mrs.
Wise and Son.
ST. PAUL. Nov. ii.â James Hardy and
Elmer Miller, who have been on trial at
Anoka for the murder of two members of
the Wise family, were to-day found not
guilty.
Mrs. Wise and a young son were killed
on the night of May 27 last by shots fired
through a window while seated about a
table in their farm house. William Wise,
her husband, and an elder boy. were bad
ly wounded, and have not yet recovered
from the effects of the wcunds. Eliza
Wise, aged 15, made a confession, alleg
ing that Miller and Hardy, who were sai'l
to be lovers of hersrlf and eister, had
planned to get rid of the old folks in
order that the girls might inherit the
farm and a i-:mall sum of money. On
the trial of the two young men, who are
both under age. the Wise sisters testified
to the alleged conspiracy, and the State
presented in corroboration of their evi
dence the testimony ol Allla Preston; who
alleged that Hardy had proposed to him
to join in the crime.
The defense rested its case upon an
alibi, and sought to discredit the testi
mony of the Wise sisters and Preston by
alleging that they had been coached by
detectives, who were working for the
large reward offered by the State.

BERLIN, Nov. 11.â The German bourses
were completely dominated last week by
the election in the United States and Wall

The large sales of Iron in the United

outcome of the election, interpreting the
result as favorable to the German money

blessedness, the young woman who may
Inherit a portion of Asa Packer's wealth
was Miss Ida Ashley, daughter of Mr
and Mrs. L. E. Ashley of this city. Her
beauty and talent and winning disposition
made her a general favorite. Her rise
, . â¢ â Â¦ â
on the stage was rapid and her friends
rejoiced in her pronounced success. Re
cently she married Archie H. Ellis, the
advance agent of one of the great vaude
ville combinations, and thereupon retires
from the stage. Her expectations of a
fortune are thus set forth in the Buffalo
Courier of October 13:
Miss Vila Sayne. an actress, has just re
ceived word that she Inherits a part of the
f.-.iau? of the late Asa Packer, the great Penn
sylvania railroad king. The news reached her
through a San Francisco firm of lawyers, who
hnve been engaged in looking up the heirs.
Miss Sayne's good fortune comes through the
death of an uncle, Asa Packer Wilbur, who tor
the past twenty years Has lived in San Fran-
Cisco ar.d has been looked on as an eccentric
tlaracter. He died suddenly on August 15 of
this year and his remains were buried In the
putters' Held. On September 1 they were ex
humed and reinterred in a lot in Cypress Lawn
Cemetery.
According to the story Asa Packer, uncle oft
the dead man, willed his immense estate to
h!s children, and through a curious combination
of circumstances the direct legatees have been
reduced to fourâ Miss Sayne and three others.
Her share will amount to at least $5,000,COO.
Miss Sayne in private life is the wife of
Archie H. Ellis and since her marriage about
two years ago she has retired from the stage
and makes her home In Brooklyn, N. Y. Mr.
Kill* is traveling ahead of the Behman rhow.
which will appear in Shea's Garden Theater
next week. Yesterday, while in Buffalo, he
first heard of his wife's big legacy.
Miss Ashley began her dramatic career
by appearing at various amateur theatri
cals. About six years ago she obtained
an engagement with a traveling company
and her former friends lost trace of her.
The news of her good fortune came as a
great surprise.
Mrs. L. E. Ashley says that Asa Packer
was her husband's uncle. She does not
know how much foundation there is to
justify her daughter's expectations of
wealth, but naturally she is greatly In
terested in the subject. Mrs. Ellis has
sent to her mother a great many clip
pings, showing that at least the news
papers appear to believe that there is a
reasonable chance that Miss Sayne will
pet a portion of the millions of Asa
Packer.

ar.ts for the millions left by
Asa Bird Packer. â¢ former
Governor of Pennsylvania,
are bobbing up all over the
world. The latest is Baroness von
Zieber. a niece. She is a singer. Her
n^other was for many years a lady-in
waiting to the Empress of Austria.
A mphew of Asa Packer, who was
known as Asa Packer Wilbur, recently
died in extreme poverty In San Francisco,
whore he had worked for some years as
a reporter on a small dramatic news
paper. When he died he had no money
and was buried in potter's field. flamo
time afterward it was discovered that he
was entitled to a share in the Packer
millions. Later it came'to light that his
niece. Miss? Vila Sayne, as she was known
on the stage, was also a legitimate heir
to the fortune. She was traced to this
city, where it was discovered she had
teen a member of the Weber & Fields
chorus, and had afterward married
Archie Ellis, who is connected with the
Hyde & Behman enterprise in Brooklyn.
She was notitiod by a firm of San Fran
cisco lawyers, and it is now known that
these three persons mentioned are heirs
to an estate of probably $20,000,000.
Mrs. Ellis was born in Stockton. Cal..
and, until a few days ago, knew nothing
of her uncle. Asa Packer Wilbur, the
newspaper reporter. She did not even
know she had an uncle, much less that
he was heir to millions and that she was
his relative. When the news came from
San Francisco it was in the nature of a
surprise, and she at first refused to be
lieve it. She has been convinced, how
ever. Mrs. Ellis, before her theatrical
debut, was known in Stockton as Miss
Ida Ashley.

SPRINGFIELD. Ohio. Nov. 11.â Katie
Chambers, who was snatched from the
arms of loving friends on a Thanksgiving
day, is speeding westward to arrive home
on the sixteenth anniversary of her disap
pearance and bring true thanksgiving to
a long lost and joyful parent.
"Who am Iâ lost, strayed or stolen?"
came Klttie's recent plea from Aiken, S.
C, to Postmaster I. N. Searing of Belle
fontaine, this State. "I have had strange
dreams of late. It may be there is noth
ing in them. I suppose there is not. but
they come persistently to my mind and
trouble me greatly. In my dreamsâ if
dreams they areâ I was enticed away by
gypsies from my nome in Bellefontalne
sixteen years ago. My life has been full
of mystery, care and Ill-treatment. I have
imagined that my father's name was Jo
seph Chambers; that a kind of a letter
from somewhere would reach me. Who
am I â lost, strayed or stolen?"
J. B. Clotworthy of Aiken, S. C. an em
ployer of the unfortunate girl, has also
written to the Postmaster asking him to
lend his necessary assistance in the af
fair. Joseph Chambers, a wealthy mer
chant, formerly resided here, but now is
living in San Diego. Cal.
The child, it is stated, was kidnaped six
teen years ago. and on Thanksgiving day.
A strolling band of gypsies was sus
pected and watched. Despite all efforts no
trace of the little girl was discovered and
she was mourned as one dead. Postmaster
Searing at once communicated with Mr.
Chambers. As a result the following let
ter was immediately dispatched:

THE DECLINE OF THE BICYCLE.
SOME time ago we directed attention to reports
from Great- Britain concerning the decline in
the bicycle trade in that kingdom. The report3
were to the effect that not only had the number of
machines sold during the year been smaller than in
any year for some time past>,but that the machines
in demand were of the cheaper grades. Those facts
were regarded by British authorities as evidences that
bicycling as an amusement for wealthy men and
women has about run its course, and the machine is
now to be used mainly for purposes of utility by
those who have occasion to cover considerable dis
tances either in the course of their work or in going to
and from their homes and their places of employment.
It now appears there has been something of a simi
lar decline in bicycling in this cotfntry, although the
information concerning it does npt come from the
trade, as did that of Great Britain. The signs of th"
decline here have been noted on the streets and in the
parks. Thus the Washington Post notes that society
in that city has well nigh given up the use of the
wheel? The fact is the more. notable because Wash
ington is, of all American cities, best adapted for
cycling. It has miles of well streets^ paved
with smooth asphaltum, and most of them are without
heavy grades. Moreover, as is well known, it is "a'
city of magnificent distances," and accordingly there
are almost all kinds of inducements for using the ma
chine both for pleasure and for business. Neverthe
less the Post notes that at present the wheel is hardly
ever used for pastime, and is now employed chiefly, as

It is, of course, a sentimental issue merely, but
sentiment is worth something. It will be worth
while for California's representatives in Congress to
ask the Navy Department to reconsider the deter
mination to give the name of California to a cruiser.
The name of California should be borne on the ocean
not by a flying "commerce destroyer," but by a fight
ing ship that flies from nothing and is able to win
victory on the seas from anything that floats under
an alien flag.
There is, however, another claim that California
can put forward. In the shipyards of this State have
been constructed battleships that are the pride of thi
navy. At this time the war vessel which among all
the fleets on the ocean has achieved the greatest feat,
and which bears the proud title "peerless," is the
Oregon; and she was constructed in our shipyards.
Nor docs that vessel stand alone as an evidence of
what California shipyards can do in the way of battle
ship construction. By right of our achievements in
that line, therefore, we can with justice ask that the
name California be reserved for the next great battle
ship which the nation builds.
There will be something of gratification in knowing
that the ship that bears the name of California in our
navy will be as good as any of her class, but the
gratification will fall far short of satisfaction. Cali
fornia is entitled to representation in the navy by a
battleship rather than by a cruiser. This is one of
the foremast States of the Union. It is in no sense
inferior to Maine, Oregon, Kentucky, Iowa and
others whose names in the navy are borne by battle
ships. On that score alone we have a right to claim
a battleship of the highest class for the State, and to
feel disappointment at the selection of' "California"
as the name for a cruiser when other ships of that
class are named after second-rate States.
Jâ -JROM the special correspondent of The Call at
I Washington there was published yesterday a full
account of the plans adopted for the armored
cruiser which is to bear the name "California." It
is expected that when completed she will be one of
the best ships of her class upon the ocean; and the
class will be a large one, for there are to be con
structed for our own navy five other cruisers of equal
dimensions, to bear the names West Virginia, Mary
land, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota-

The Pacific Coast is not a whit behind the other
sections of the land In commercial activity. We are
still rolling up a great export record, while local trade
was never better at this time of the year, except in
1S90, when we were enjoying a boom over the out
fitting of troops and transports for the Philippines.
Xor are we very far behind 1899 as it is. Money is
plentiful at easy rates, collections are as good as they
ever are, and there are no large failures to cause dis
trust. In fact, the Pacific Coast has been the banner
section of the country in a business way for months.
The country, from present indications, has four'
active and prosperous years ahead of it. True re
verses may come, for this country is so intimately
bound up with the European nations in trade and
finance that any national disaster there is apt to affect
the United States in sympathy; but as far as this
country is individually concerned there is nothing now
in sight to indicate other than a period of long-con
tinued prosperity. , . .
It was in Wall street, however, that the greatest
activity prevailed. All through the week trading was
heavy, and for three days after the election the figures
exceeded the million mark. Orders for securities
came from all sections of the country, and the feelinf
of gratification and relief over the result of the elec^
tion was pronounced. A significant feature was thi
advance in the price of seats in the Stock Exchange!
On Thursday the business was next to the great rec
ord day of December 18, 1899, with the important dif
ference that the latter was a bear day, while last
Thursday was a great bull day.
There was more change in the condition of the lead
ing staples after the election. The ante-election apathy
was succeeded by a tendency to fluctuate. Sugar de
clined. The Chicago packers made a flat advance of
1 cent per pound on beef, pork and mutton. Wheat
rose, partly under adverse reports from the Argen
tine, and partly owing to the spirit of improvement
permeating the commercial atmosphere. Wool and
cotton also did better, the latter owing to fears of
crop damage, and the former under the stimulus of a
better demand. The iron trade seemed to acquire
renewed life, and Chicago reported the largest week's
business this year. Birmingham, Pittsburg and Cin
cinnati also reported increased activity, with more
sales in certain lines than for rponths. The West re
ported dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes and
hardware moving off better. The East quoted an in
creased movement in leather, shoes, wool, tobacco
and coal. Hides were quoted active and very firm al!
over the country. Thus it will be seen that the tri
umph of the sound-money party at the polls re
sulted in an immediate improvement in business, as
all intelligent business men knew it would.
But the revival was not limited to stocks and bonds.
Merchandise felt the infusion of the commercial tonic,
and bankers and merchants reported a large increase
in business. Goods in large amounts were shipped
out of Chicago to country merchants who had made
their orders. subject to McKinley's election, and an
army of commercial travelers was sent out into the
field: One firm alone sent out fifty men, most of
whom would have stayed at home had Bryan been
elected.
THE feature of business last week was the im
mediate revival following the election of Presi
dent McKinley. Operations of all sorts, which
had been timorously held in abeyance for several
months in the apprehension of an adverse result of
the election, burst into sudden bloom. There was
an immediate advance all along the line of stocks in
Wall street, both industrials and railways rising ma
terially under thÂ« heaviest trading for a long tim;.
The demand for securities was so sharp that it over
whelmed many commission brokers, who, though
they kept their ofnees open all night, were obliged to
decline large lines of offered business. Nor was this
rush to resume active trading confined to New York.
The London market also became excited, and all
offerings from New York were immediately absorbed.
The American securities dominated everything. To
employ the language of the cabled report, "they were
the first, the rest were nowhere."-

Taken altogether, the songs of this year have been
much below the level of campaign singing in former
years, .and we have no reason to regret that it was
limited in quantity. It is worth noting in closing
that a' Prohibition song tells how a Sunday-school
man went about for a year denouncing a brewer for
selling beer, but on 'election day voted the regular
ticket; and the song closes: '
The foxy old brewer was cheerful and mellow;
Said he: "I admire that Sunday school fellow;
He's true to his churchâ to his party he's truer, -!,/.
He talks for the Lord, but he votes for the brewer."
Another campaign song, which can hardly be classi
fied as to party, since it strikes at both McKinley
and Bryan, and may be the production of a mugwump
or a middle-of-the-road Populist, starts out in this
way:
Oh, have you heard sweet William from the wild and
woollv West,
Who warbles, "Vote for silver now, the devil take the
rest!
'Twill brlnj? us all prosperity In the sweet by and by!"
I wonder, while he warbles thus, does Willie wink his
eye?
For it don't make any difference to either you or I,
For it's bis hogâ or little hog-
Root, hojr. or die!
A Democratic lyric called "The Farmer's Cam
paign Song," represents a farmer addressing his wife
and saying in one verse:
I have rlz up many a morning? hour before the sun,
And nlcht has o'ertaken me before the task was done:
Vhcn weary with my labor, 'twas this that nerved my
arm: * â,
The Free Silver party will pay the mortgage on the farm.
It is noted that the chief characteristic of the cam
paign songs of this year is the frequency of their ap
peals to the memory of Jefferson and Lincoln, and
it is also. a characteristic of the time that both of those
'great memories were appealed to on both sides. Out
side of- the appeals to the patriots of the past there
were marked differences between the songs of the two
parties. As a rule, Republican songs were exultant
chants for prosperity and victory, while the Demo
cratic songs were characterized by references to pov
erty and promises of good times to come.
A typical Republican song, "The Bugle Sounds
Again," has this chorus:
The grand old party bugle Is sounding far and wide,
McKlnley and Roosevelt on our elephant are astride,
And straight to the White House in November they
will go,
While Bryan on the jncknss will flounder In the snow.
From the beginning campaign songs have been
crude as to language and not particularly lofty in
sentiment. They arc frequently set, however, to well
known airs, so that the melodies are often popular
and catchy. Crude as the words are, however, the
songs serve, as the correspondent points out, to show
what sort of appeals were most popular in each cam
paign. The songs of 1868, for example, were all ap
peals to sustain the work of the Civil War on th-
Republican side and Greenback appeals and denun
ciations of the "Rads" on the Democratic side.
It appears, however, that the campaign just finished
was comparatively scngless. A correspondent of the
New York Times who has gone over the campaign
songs on file in the musical department of the Con
gressional Library says that in comparison with other
years "1900 makes a very slim showing." He adds:
"Of what songs there are about nine-tenths are Dem
ocratic. The Republican output is so slim that it is
hard to find. The music department is full of Re
publican songs of past years, particularly of 1868 and
1896, which were great years for Republican songs,
but it takes persistent search to find Republican songs
of 1000."
SINCE the earliest days of the republic Presi
dential campaigning has been marked by the
liberal use of songs. There have been times
indeed when the campaign song was more notable
than the oratory. The election of William Henry
Harrison was an instance of that kind. The Whigs
in that contest had two songs of such force that the
fame of them lives tven to our day; and there is
hardly any American who has not heard of "Tippe
canoe and Tyler, Too," and of "Poor Little Van Is a
Used-up Man."

The Loughboroughs are about to pive
up their home- on Franklin street and will
go to Coronado beach for the winter

have taken the hous=e for the winter and
will entertain extensively there in honor
of their charming daughter.
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Parrott have also
decided not to keep house this winter,
and, like the Kruttschnitts, will be located
at the Richelieu.
Little by little the Burlingamites are

Mr. Foorman was made a citizen in
Ohio in '47, and in '48 cast his first ballot
for President, voting for Taylor. "Taylor
wa3 an Ohio man. So is McKinley." That
is the argument Mr. Foorman used with
Dr. Lane and that was the argument that
made science yield to sentiment â¢ and
patriotism.
The prettiest story that I heard In con
nection v.-ith the election was told about
dear old Sum Foorman, stanch Republi
can, who since MS never has neglected to
cast his ballot for the Republican candi
date. For the past few months Mr. Foor
man has been ill and the greater part
of the time confined to his bod. On Mon
day last the old gentleman celebrated his
eighty-second birthday ari*d on Tuesday,
backed by his tremendous will power and
the permission of his physician, he got
out of bed. was assisted to his carriage
and driven to the polls, where he cast his
vote, a straight Republican one.
This ira.ts the flattest election I ever saw.
I know any number of girls who stood
ready to wager any number of gloves and
boxes of candy on the result, but no one
would bet with them. The girls stood solid

considerable excitement. Mrs. Max Sloss
and Mrs. Julius Kahn told me that last

some exciting hours and when the victory
finally came to his baby boy I was told
the dear old daddy was In a state of al
most complete collapse.

BY SALLY SHARP.
OF allthe fakes which distinguished the â¢ last
Bryan campaign, the one put out by the Ex
aminer just before the day of election, claim
ing that there was an attempt all over the country
to boycott and overawe the president of Wells, Fargo
& Co., easily takes the first prize. A picture.pf Val
entine was run in connection with the letter of Banker
Spitzer so there could be no mistake in the identity
of the good man sought to be unjustly intimidated.
This paper at the time denounced the proceeding
as a political roorback which was sprung at the last
minute to give the closing scenes of the Bryan cam
paign a dramatic effect and in the hope that some
votes might be affected by it. We then asserted that
Valentine must have had possession of this letter for
nearly two months, and if he was honest about this
scare, why did he not sooner appeal to the country
for protection? In an interview published in his or
gan the next day Valentine admitted that this threat
ening letter had been in his hands several weeks be
fore he made this outcry about intimidation.
It is now reported that this play for sympathy had
also another motive behind it. That at the opening
of the campaign Valentine was taken into the Demo
cratic camp, and visions of high political office danced
before him. That afterward great indignation was
expressed by many of the stockholders of Wells,
Fargo & Co. that the president of the company should
attempt to earn his $25,000 salary by devoting his
time and the facilities of the company in preparing
and disseminating his Bryan effusions. That appeals
were made to the directors of the company to stop
this abuse, and that toward thÂ« end of the campaign
Valentine saw not only that Bryan's chances were
gone but that he was also in danger of losing his own
head, and so set up this threat dodge as a cover and
to save himself from deposition by indignant stock
holders.
Letters from some of these stockholders complain
ing of the abuse of his position by Valentine have
come to our attention. This is not a matter with
which the general public has to deaJ, 'and the stock
holders can do as they please, but if they arc wise
they will speedily rid themselves of this faker who
has been without an equal in this State since the days
of Dr. McDonald and his vinegar bitters. Ten years
ago Wells, Fargo & Co. was the most popular cor
poration in this State; to-day, by reason of resistance
to the war tax and the political performance of Valen
tine, it is the most unpopular, the' Southern Pacific
always excepted.
The Republican party has no grievance against
Valentine. His influence did it no harm. The em
ployes of the company understand the trick by which
he kept up his own salary in 1894, though pretending
to reduce it, while he cut the wages of the rest. We
are advised that some of the Bryan documents which
he sent out to the employes were returned with re
marks of disapproval and defiance. If those inter
ested in the company are satisfied to keep this Peck
sniff in his position the public can endure him. but
we predict that he will soon be relegated to a position
where he will have to pay charges for the transporta
tion of his political documents.
VALENTINE'S ROORBACK.
SOCIETY: ABOUT THE OPERA AND PETER MARTIN
The decline in cycling as an amusement does not
in any way imply a deterioration-of the wheel as a
useful machine. It was never so speedy or so con
venient as now. It will remain a valuable help to
workingmen and to all persons who live at a distance
from their places of business.- To that extent labor
is indebted to the fashion that made the fine/ind per
fected wheel a possibility, and thus the cycling fad is
one that has not been without benefit to the whole
community â which is much more than can be said for
golfing."
In Philadelphia a similar condition' of things Is
noted. During the month oi August of this year
only 40,037 bicycles entered Fafrmount Park, while
the number for August last year was 91,968. Com
menting upon the situation the Record says: "This
great diminution" is not due to any fault of the wheel,
which has been improved with each year, but may
be traced to the fickleness of the pleasure-seeking
Americans. The people of this country took to the
bicycle like a starved dog to a bone.. In his new en
thusiasm a preacher declared that the Creator, had
made a mistake in not bringing man into the world
ready equipped with rubber-tire wheels. For a few
years the chief object of most earnest lives was to ac
quire a $100 bicycle or to master its eccentricities.
From infants to centenarians, all the world was rolling
along and clamoring for good roads."
The New York Times notes in that city "it has been
evident for some time that the craze was over. The
bicycle is still seen, and upon the boulevard,
in considerable numbers, though not in the intermin
able lines that formerly made the wheel parade a Sun
day wonder."
an article of utility to get clerks and workmen to and
from their business, and occasionally to carry former
bicycle devotees to the golf links.

FINDS EVERYTHING DELIGHTFUL
REPORT OF THE
INDIAN BUREAU
COMMISSIONER
Recommends the Abolish
ment of General Issuance
of Rations.
Controverts the Theory That the
Noble Red Man Is Being Exter
minated by the Advent of
Civilization.
WASHINGTON, Nov. U.-The Ictal ex
penditure by the Government on account
of the Indian service from March 4. 1793.
up to and Including July SO, 1900. has been
fSCS,SCÂ«.:i7. according to the annual report
of Commissioner of Indian Affairs Wil
liam A. Jones. The expenditures for the
n?caÂ£ year ended Jast July amounted to
S10.1, o.lCT. Of this amount $3,330,000 was
devoted io the cause of Indian education.
Under the head of obstacles to self-sup
port of the Indians the report deprecates
the ration system, annuity payments and
the leasing of allotments. The ration sys
tem, says the report. Is the corollary "of
the reservation system. The Indian pop
ulation of the rnited States is about 267.
Â£>J. of which 43.270 receive a daily ration.
The ration has been gradually reduced the
past few years, in accordance with the
policy of the Indian bureau. If the In
dians claim for full rations as a right is
conceded the Commissioner predicts that
the time when they will be self-supporting
lies in the very distant future, if it comes
at all. The Commissioner urges that the
indiscriminate issue of rations should stop
at once.
There is now in the treasuryto the cred
it of the Indian tribes $33,315,955 09. draw
ing interest at the rate of 4 and 5 per cent,
the anr.ual interest amounting to $1,646.
4So 96. Beside? this several of the tribes
have large incomes from leasing and oth
<r sources. It it a safe prediction that so
lor.p as rhese fur.ds exist they will be the
prey of designing people, the ultimate
disposition of the Indian funds Is a sub
ject for the most serious consideration.
The general i^as-'ing of their allotments
by the Indians to white men is denounced.
There were 250 Indian schools of ali
kinds conducted by the Government, and
an increase of 3412 pupils in enrollment
snd U-SC in average attendance shown over
the previous year. About BOOO of the 34.000
eligible school children are unprovided for.
Compulsory education of the Indian chil
dren is strongly indorsed.
ThÂ« report controvert* the commonly ac
cepted theory that by constant contact
with the whites the extinction of the In
dian ;s only a matter of time. It says it
ran bf> staled with a exeat d^prce of "con
liderco that the Indian population of the
United States has been very little dimin
ished from the days of Columbus. Coro
nado. Raleiph. Captain John Smith and
other early explorers.
Reviewing inclian Territory affairs the
report says thtre are 50,000 children of
white parpnts there who should have
schools. The cost of education will not be
excessive compared with results. School
i enefits also should be extended to the
1230 Choctaw frc-edmen. Government con
trol of the school in the Chlckasaw na
tion is advocated.
Many years ago men discovered drug?. With
this came the discovery that pleasure without
action, and therefore it is assumed without
reaction, might be bought with a few pence.
That this Idea Is fallacious Is proven by our
decadent literature, the offspring of drugs.
The pessimist tells us that the only reality
In life is death. Surely this is not so. The
man has never lived who says this. Trie
realities of life are love and action. It Is tha
lack of these that produces the modern pessim
ist. It Is the reaction which come from un
earned pleasures and spurious Joys. Every Joy
we taste we must pay for, such is the Im
mutable law of nature. .
To see things as they really are Is the ob
ject of the modern philosophic pessimist. Ths
highest wisdom looks to the causes which pro
duce, not to the things which are.
Wbt is a great cause of pessimism. All mili
tant nations are decadent nations. They must
eventually, decay, as did the great empire of
Rome. That there seems no way out of this
is the cause or foundation from which arises
the philosophy of despair, built up by many
of the thinking men of Europe.
Sorrow and sadness, however, have little to
do with the philosophy, of pessimism. In the
transition from childhood to manhood there
Is a period in which everything is confused
and obscure. Following thin there is found a
condition of Joy, of abounding happiness, of
the mere Joy of living. Then comes, however,
almost Invariably a reaction, a sense that there
is nothing worth while, a feeling of contentioa
at the unknown power, embittering because un
known, which deals out the cards of life.
Most people pass through this period. Xearly
every one becomes at some period in his life
a cynic. With the most part it is but a
transient condition. With some it takes the
form of Imitationâ a pessimism culled from the
perusal of cheap decadent literature. This was
the cause a few years ago of the drooping col
lars worn by the students, in imitation of the
humble neckwear worn by Byron.
One of the few things we know in life is
thisâ we can see or know nothing absolutely.
.With a pessimistic philosopher nothing Is
worth while. If we take up the threads of life
at the end we can never live. We must take
up the ends that lie near to us..
As a layman I have the privilege of showing
the text that I base my sermon on to be fal
lacious. For this reason I take the Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam x I shall try to show that
however beautiful. they may be as poetry, they
are not sound philosophy. '
This poem perhaps constitutes our greatest,
fullest expression ot an unsolvable problem. It
Is full of the sweetness and sadness of life
and death.
The philosophy of despair as embodied
in Omar Khayyam served the speaker for
an example from which to draw his de
ductiors. .Dr. Jordan spoke in part as
follows:
President David Starr Jordan speaking
yesterday morning from the pulpit of the
First Congregational Church at Mason
and Post streets declared the modern
spirit of pessimism to be the product of
either drugs, tobacco and wine, or dyspep
sia. Love and action, he declared, are the
fundamental mainsprings of a healthy
life, and no man can be possessed of the
powers, essential for these qualities unless
he leads a healthy life. If he possess
them he must of necessity be a hopeful
man believing that "the great altar steps
of life do not terminate in darkness, but
lead ever upward to the throne of God."
Ine man who is not in possession of these
faculties, said the speaker, becomes pes
simistic and the only reality he sees in
life Is death.

simism at First Congrega

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1900.
the most remarkable musical event of
years." And who will not agree with
him?
A fine basso voice broke into an aria. It
came from the next room. It grew louder.
Mr. Grau fumbled for his glasses. "Van
Dyck," he said. "He Is In fine voice, ch?
So are they all."
"You do not fear t^at any will disap
point?"
The little man's shoulders rose. If he
had been Spanish he would have said,
"Qulen sabe." Mr. Grau has brought San
Francisco what, to use his own words, is
tin extraordinary eventâ to-night he is to
see the fruits.
The members of the Grau Opera Com
pany to tho number of twenty-live or
more arrived by special train from L#os
Angeles at 10 o'clock last night and were
driven immediately to the Palace Hotel,
where they secured apartments. The
lobby of tho hotel presented an animated
appearance while the singers were being
domiciled for the night. They were all
fatigued and retired to rest as soon as
they were assigned , rooms. Among the
artists were De Reske. Plancon, Salig
nac. Imbart de la Tour. Campanari and
Scotti; Mesdames Suzanne Adams. Nor
dica, Scheff. Olitzka. Strong, Bauer
melstcr and Bridewell.
It every year. Your climate is charming.
"I can tell you, I wish we had San
Francisco In Brooklyn. Ah!"â the glasses
were poised above the little man's head,
and then down they came with a crash,
and one could almost hear the big kettle
drum'roll. "Then, then we would give
performances to make the world stare;
but Brooklyn" â the glasses sank to his
knee.
"How about Los Angeles? Ah. that de
lightful city! Such houses." The eye
glasses do not beat when the little impre
sario talks business. "How shall I say it?
But the theaterâ Hazard's Pavilion. Ah,
well, the artists like It. and when they
like anything "
Mr. Grau sit?hed and looked at a Los
Angeles clipping.
"The advance subscription sale of seats
is unprecedented here. >ir Grau."
"So they tell me. Well, my railroad ex
penses will be $20,000." â¢
"And vour salary list?"
"We will not talk about that." Mr.
Grau looked over the roofs toward the
Grand Opera-house and put hl3 eyeglasses
Into h!s pocket.
Never was there a man who found
everything so delightful In life as Mr.
Grau. The trip: Delightful. San Fran
cisco? Delightful. Suzanne Adams? De-
MAURICE GRAU, the world
famous Impresario and dis
penser of bij? salaries to
equally famous artists, ar
rived here yesterday morn
ing and Is Installed at the Palace.
Mr. Grau is so very businesslike that
from him to music seems a far cry. But
it Is his business instinct that has put him
in his artistic position. Mr. Grau's com
pany travels in ten cars. Mr. Grau's scen
ery takes up but one car less. How many
cars Mr. Grau's profits will fillâ who can
eay but the man In the box office.
At Mr. Grau's bidding song birds whom
no ordinary glided .bait could lure wing
out to San Francisco and' feather their
nests with the satisfactory result. He Is
the ruler of a Wagnerlan kingdomâ a king
'of sharps and flats. Yet he wears his hon
ors lightly and leans back in his business
chair, dressed fn a business suit, and talks
In a businesslike way.
But one little musical trait crops out
from this very embodiment of business.
When Mr. Grau talks he takes his gold
rimmed eyeglasses, through which he has
gazed on who knows how many an oper-

ORIGIN OP
PANCAKES ON SHROVE TUESDAY.
When the Danes conquered England
and reached the villages around Sher-
wood Forest, all the Saxon men ran
off into the forest and tbe Danes took
the Saxon women to keep house for
them.
This happened just before Lent and
the Saxon women encouraged by their
fugitive lords, resolved to massacre
their DanLsh masters' on Ash Wed-
Every woman who agreed to do thU \\
was to bake pancakes for their meal//
on Shrove Tuesday. This was donÂ©
as sort of a pledge, and that the mas-
sacre of the Danes did take place on
Ash Wednesday to an historical fact.
It was a much greater undertaking;
to fry pancake* In thoj* days
than It to now;' for with tha
H-0 Co.'* M ready to us*" packages
of Buckwheat and Pancake Flour
at every grocery store
It U as easy as boiling water.
Pancakes were never liked so well

is reported that Captain A. J. Kelleher,
regimental adjutant, will be superceded
end that there is a possibility that Lieu
tenant W. H. Tobin, now inspector of
rifle practice, will be tendered the position.
First Lieutenant Herman Huber, regi
mental commissary, is also elated as one
of the outs, but his successor has not yet
been narirea. There are also three vacan
cies to be tilled, chaplain and two bat
talion adjutants. There is a good deal of
speculation as to whether, in the plan to
harmonize the cifft-rent interests and fac
tions in the regiment, any tender of po
pitions will be made to oJhcers of the four
companies. C, G, F and K, located in the
ililis-strc-et Armory.
Captain Charles E. Goodell, command-
Ing Company C, beingr employed on one of
the transportation lines, is unable to at
tend to the duties of commander and for
that reason has tendered his resignation.
Captain John F. Eggert of Company L,
employed bv the same transportation com
pany, finds* himself in the same position
that Captain Goodell Is as to duty, and
he will probably send in his resignation
shortly aftrr the annual muster.
Captain Wall, who was elected to com
mand Company M several months ago. is
etill without his commission. It is ex
peeled, nowever, that the matter will be
acted upon within a few days, now that
the election is over.
During the last week all the companies
of the First have been drilling: and pre
paring for the inspection to commence
next Tuesday night. The rolls of eleven
of the companies have been purged of
those who have not been attendants at
drills, bv reason of absence from the city.
These commanders do not want to appear
at muster with a lonj? list of names on the
company roll and have many absent. The
company that is an exception expects to
show only five or six absentees, and for
each there Is a valid and constitutional
excuse.

first money in a champion stake, but the
wise ones cared little for form. Palo
Alto was nt>t only epeedy, but carried
with him. a reputation which was worth
porr.etl ir.gr, and then, see who Palo Alto
Is. Mose. no matter how fast, could not
beat Pa!Â» Aito and his reputation too, so
allowing: one for the dog and four for tho
"rep," the ones who know how to place
tho money Just made it 5 to 1 on the
Mack tnd white dog- "lie who hesi
tates" â but Faio Alto had no chance to
hesitate, but lost anyhow.
The rai.Â«i!iÂ£ of the red flag set the tal
rnt guessing, hut Palo Alto will be an
"odds on" when he runs again.

dition and ran with better speed than
in any of his trials for some time past.
Red Anpus reached the fifth round by

fhowcfl a steady improvement. He lost
to Fiery Face after leading r.nd scoring
the first four points. Seventeen short

SUMMARY.
Runi responsible forâ Devereau* & Home
"Red-dog" Devereaux was' punished in
ferocious style on the Oakland grounds
yesterday morning. In two innings the lo
cal team untwisted his curves and ava
lanches of hits resulted. At the outset of
tho game four safe hits with good base
running gave the San Francisco team
three runs. In the fifth inning the same
conditions and the same results pre
vailed. Even Ancient Rube vaulted the
fence for a "homer."
As)bad as Devereaux was just so good
was 'Fitzpatrick. He pitched faultless
ball. In the sixth inning McLaughlin sin
gled and this was the only hit of the Sac
ramento team ln the game. The errors
were exceedingly scarce, the battle be
longing to the pitchers. The score:
SAN FRANCISCO.

OX the last lap the local team has !
begun a spurt which may carry
the fluttering hearts of fanatics
over a few hurdles before the
wire is reached. By a stroke of
luck Hank beat all the pet resolutions of
the Senators, and in the three games of
this local series he plucked as many vic
tories. On the Oakland grounds yester
day morning San Francisco whitewashed
Sacramento and In the afternoon at Rec
reation grounds, an enthusiastic crowd
pacJving the stands, the Senators were
submerged to the tune of 5 to 3.
This puts the home team in the pennant
running once again, but badly handi
capped. The lead of the champions is less
than 30 per cent, but with but three weeks
Of the season left for action it is a case
of wine to a glass of foaming steam that
the pennant will be swung to the Sacra
mento zephyrs. The game yesterday aft
ernoon gave San Francisco the majority
of those played between these two teams.
The locals have eighteen to their credit
out of thirty-five played. They will meet
again â once, on Thanksgiving day in this
city.
Hughes was an easy mark yesterday
and by reason of the timely hitting of
the local swatters the game was attached
for Hank. Ten times they rifled his
i strong box, getting a package of fire
works in the fifth which put the quietus
on the Senators. Knell was ln good trim,
generating good curves and acting as if
his bark were well anchored. Seven times
they set fire to his ammunition, but it was
all scattered and worked little harm.
In the fifth and seventh innings the fa
natics had a chance to feel their hearts
knocking against their ribs. With two
outsâ Devereaux. Stanley and Easan on
the bags', in both instances, and Doyle at
the plateâ the crowd became a bit feverish
and noisy. Twice Doyle failed wheFe he
might have won the game. In the ilfth
he fouled to Sullivan; In the seventh he
drove a high one to Hiidebrand, which
was promptly buried in that player's ca
pacious mils. And so died the Senators'
suddenly elevated hopes.
Ancient Rube Levy and Resuscitated
Knell were at home with the stick. Three
hits by Reuben suggested a rejuvenation
of eye and two by the southpaw provoked
memories of other days. Some startling
Held work by Krug and Eagan put a snap
Into the game, which was of the interest
ing order. The score:

HORSEMEN TRESPASS ON
TH E SACRED GOLF LINKS
Arrested by Military Authorities and
Reprimanded for Baring to Do
Such a Thing.
Two civilians raised quite a rumpus for
a few moments at the Presidio yesterday.
They were enjoying a ride through the
reservation and not knowing any order or
rule against such a procedure, galloped
across the golf links. They were spotted
by Captain Rumbaugh, who ordered them
to stop, but the command was unheeded.
By the time the horsemen reached the
nearest road the irate captain was ln
communication with the officer of the day
by telephone, and, describing the men and
their mounts, ordered their arrest. Cap
tain Rumbaugh failed to Inform Captain
Hardln, officer of the day, the cause for
the order, and when the men were halted
had to ask them what they had been do
ing. The surprised gentleme'n could think
of no misdemeanor or crime they had
committed and were at a loss to explain.
While the argument was going on a cou
rier arrived posthaste from the links and
gave Captain Hardin the required Infor
mation. The horses were taken from
them and sent to the stables, and the
offenders hauled up before a temporary
court composed of Major Adams and the
officer of the day. "They were finally dis
missed, after being reprimanded, and their
steeds restored.
Robert Minard and Fred Honischer
both privates in the Thirty-ninth Infan
try, died yesterday at the general hos

WILKESBARRK. Pa., .Joy. tLâ Th*
minor differences which exist between tho
Lehigh Valley Coal Company and some of
its employes arc not expected to have a
serious ending. The rock men. who ara
employed in opening tunnels and pangr
ways, have petitioned the company for a
reduction in the price of dynamite which
the company Is not inclined to grant. It
is said, however, that the way is open lor
a compromise.

Gorgeous Sunset Concludes the Day's
Pleasure â Pun at Chutes and
Sutro's Baths.
More pleasant weather and a more beau
tiful sunset than that of yesterday -were
never enjoyed by pleasure-seekers at the
beach. Early in the day people began de
serting their homes to pass the Sabbath
In the open. Shortly after noon the park
and beach were thronged and vast crowds
poured through the turnstiles of the
Chutes and Sutro's Baths. Those who en-
Joyed the treat of the day, however, re
mained at the beach until evening. The
sun, like a globe of gold, dipped beneath
the horizon, leaving behind a crimson
flood of lteht set in a leaden sky. Thou
sands stood and watched thi3 lurid herald
of the coming night until it disappeared,
wrapped in tne mist of the sea.
The dog circus is the feature at the
Chutes this week, though those equally
intelligent natives of mysterious lands,
Tess and Mr. and Mrs. Congo and their
baby, were not neglected by the crowd.
The usual aquatic contests entertained
the visitors at Sutro Baths.
The fifty-yard dash was won by H. Lei
cellier, G. Sundberg second; the under
water swimming contest by Hugh Lindon,
William Hoburg second: tub race, won by
J. Lubsell. Lundberg second, Paulln third:

It is a huge gamble to bring across the
continent a small matter of 250 people,
one of the largest orchestras, the largest
chorus, the largest collection of stars, in
cluding only seven conductors, on the
reputation that San Francisco has some
how acquired Eastward as a musical city.
Mr. Grau ; knows it. and Is probably the
only man in America who would have
undertaken the risk.
At the Grand Opera-house to-night will
be inaugurated one of the most impor
tant musical happenings in the history of
San Francisco since the Thomas orchestra
season, now many years ago. The Grau
organization Is the largest, most impor
tant aggregation of operatic talent now
before the public, either in Europe or
America. The very best the world has
in the line of opera, stars, orchestra,
chorus, conductors, repertoire, scenic ac
cessories and every detail and depart
ment of opera, Is ours for a good three
weeks and tho necessary dollars. This
Is a tentative effort, according to Mr.
Uraii. and on our wise or otherwise ap
preciation of this best that the world
affords depends both the possible repeti
tion of the season and our much-vaunted
reputation as a musical city. It is our
habit to boast loudly of a critical genius
so far as both music and the drama are
concerned, and now in very truth is the
acceptable time, now the precious mo
ment, for making good our large claims.

BERKELEY, Nov. 11.â There is
mutiny in the glee club of the
University of California, and
the State institution has on its
hands an organization with
practically no members, while the original
members "possess an organization with no
officially recognized name. The old mem
bers have all withdrawn from the glee
club and refuse to attend rehearsals, but
while the members still maintain an as
sociation they are not permitted to use
the name of the State University.
The trouble started when the university
tried to put the glee club on somewhat of
a business basis after it had accumulated
a deficit of 12200. Part of this "business
basis" consisted of the securing of a reg
ulafimuslcal director, supplanting Clinton
R. Mcrse, who had been the leader of the
glee club for these many years, and the
establishing of a standard of membership
by which musical ability was the- sola
requisite, and not good fellowship or so
cial standing. Â¦ Â¦ -Â¦> -
The university assumed the debts of the
glee club and undertook to liquidate them.
The executive committee dispensed with
the services of Morse and asked David
Loring. whose musical ability Is Â¦ well
known, to take charge of the club. Mr.
Loring consented, but when he appeared
to assume his duties he found no members
to train. The members simply refused to
attend rehearsals and Mr. Loring quietly
withdrew. Â¦ -
When the old members did not set what
they wanted they quietly withdrew and
when the new members were" elected under
the rule laid down by the executive com
mittee they found practically no club to
Join. Tho old members were practically
unanimous In their refusal to abide by the
rule laid "down by the committee They
could not keep the name of the Glee Club
of the University of California without
obeying these rules, and so they have or
ganised what they cnoose to call "The
California Entertainers," and this organi
zation is preparing to flaunt its strength
in the face of the executive committee by
giving an entertainment on Tuesday
night. - ,
Matters have come to such a pass that
the old glee club has appointed Du Ray
Smith; its president, to wait upon the ex
ecutive committee and request the ap
pointment of Clinton R. Morse as leader.
But the old members wanted control of
the membership and they wanted Morse
for director.
Then the executive committee selectPd
William King to take charge of the glee
club, and A. W. Black of San Francfsco
was put In charge of the mandolin and
banjo club.. But still the old members of
the musical clubs of the University of Cil
ifornia; who had warbled from Seattle to
San Diego and had contracted debts In
proportion to the length of thpfr iÂ»-nr i
blings. did not attend. -Mr. King wanted
a musical standard, and not a social one
and the executive committee insisted that
any one who could sing was entitled to
membership.

PARIS, Nov. 11.â Eight persons were
killed and fifteen wounded In a collision
between a suburban train and an express
this morning at Cholsey Lcrol. The sub
urban was entering the station to allow
the express to pass, and the accident oc
curred then, the suburban train being: tel
escoped. The wreck was complete and
the line was blocked for hours.

SEATTLE. Nov. 11.â The steamer Ruth
arrived to-day from northern ports. On
the way down she lost her bearings In

; "The boys have stood out for the elec
tion of their own members, and in this
fight they have practically won. Accord
ing to their, wishes. I have been directing
them. Next vacation we will go south
under the name of the California Enter
tainers."
"I do not believe there will be any trou
ble," said Graduate Manager Reno Hutch
inson. â¢ "The boys wlllsee reason. We
have assumed their debt and they will be
willing to 8lr.gr under the new director, we
have appointed. The nee club will take
a short trip this year, but unless we are
certain of results will take no long one."
Meanwhile "The California Entertain
ers" are rehearsing for their first enter
tainment, to be given Tuesday evening in
the Berkeley Opera-house. Christmas va
cation they will tour the southern part of
the State under the management of C. R.
Morse. The members of the old glee club
who will appear , Tuesday night under the
new name are as follows: Arthur Nahl,
H. M. Schuster. Walter Brown, Walter
Bakewell. Charles Coleman, Ray Judah,
rni.Ray Smith, George Fish. Charles Ber
ger Walter jfBundscnu. William Childs,
Ralph McCormick. D. McLaren, William
Wagner and Charles Harwood. The man
dolin and banjo clubs and all the clever
vaudeville artists in college will also ap
pear. ,
The Indications are that the executive
committee will demand the right to con
trol the management of the organization
In consideration of having assumed the
debts of the club, and it is likely that the
old members will continue to refuse to
recognize any one except Morse as leader.
â¢ So the sweet bells are jangling out of
tune at the university.' and false notes
have crept into the harmony of the glee
club. There are sharps and flats where
they don't belong, and things are running
very much on ragtime.
Du Ray Smith said to-day:
"It looks now as though the executive
committee would refuse to appoint Morse,
and from the stand taken by the glee club
boys this will practically mean the break
ing up of the club. The organization will
continue, however, under the name of
'The California Entertainers. 1 Mr. King
has not held a rehearsal yet. but I don't
believe any of the fellows will go when
he does. It isn't that the boys have any
particular objection to Mr. King, but they
f-ee no reason for changing from Morse.
Of course, there is a whole lot of right on
both sides. The executive committee has
assumed our debts, amounting to some,
$2000, and we ought to stand by them. On
the other hand, we ought to have a conge
nial crowd and a congenial leader to do
good work."
C. R. Morse, once director of the glee
club but now leader of the California En
tertainers, said: Â¦

Since the back stage was furnished and
arranged to represent in a rough way each
specific indoor scene, two back scenes
representing different Interiors could not
come in succession, since this would give
no opportunity to change the furnishings,
and the Elizabethan audiences had not
learned to wait. Shakespeare waa com
pelled tp insert at least one front scene
whenever two back scenes with different
settings would otherwise come together,
Sometimes these inserted scenes are dra
matically superfluous and ineffective. Act
HI scene*6, of "Richard III"; act III.
scene 5, of "The Merchant of Venice":
act II. scene 1. of "Cymbeline," and act
III scene 8. of Julius Caesar," have been
pointed out by different critics as scenes
of this sort, forced upon Shakespeare by a
stage necessity. The first three of these
scenes are plainly superfluous on the
whole. They do not advance the action
and have little other value. The best one
of the whole four is the death of the poet
Cinna in "Julius Caesar." This is an ef
fective scene in itself considered, but It
does not help the play greatly. The pre
ceding scene In the Roman forum, con
taining Antony's great oration, is a "mass
scene." and probably the whole stage was
employed, both front and back.
I noticed recently that act III, scene 1,
of "Antony and Cleopatra" Is one of those
dramatically superfluous front scenes
Though the passage contains; some strik
ing worldy wisdom. It Is of no service to
the pay In any way. The only reason why
we nave it Is that it gave time in which
to change the back stage, which had Just
represented a scene "on board Pompey's
galley" (act II. ecene 7) into a "room in
Caesar's house" (act III. scene 2).
Alois Brandl believes that the three sep
arate divisions . of the Elizabethan stage
. WAT* sometimes all In use together; Â«hÂ°t
One who has given special attention to
the matter can realize how important in
the presentation of Shakespeare's plays
was the balcony over the "tiring house.
This third or upper stage with the hinder
wafl of the back stage represented the
walls of many cities and castlesâ for ex
ample the castle wall from which young
Arthur jumps .to his death in "King
John." This little gallery becomes the
window from which Brabantlo speaks at
the' opening of "Othello," and the window
of Juliet's chamber. From here Christo
pher Sly. changed Into a lord, witnesses
"The Taming of the Shrew." Looking
from this balcony Henry "VIII sees Cran
mer as he waits on the front stage out
side the council chaniber (act V, scene J)
and then is harshly treated within the
council chamber, the back stage. In
"Richard III" Gloucester comes to the
front of the balcony when with consum
mate hvoocrlsv he makes his appearance
"between two Bishops" (III. 7). Upon this
upper stage the play before the King In
"Hamlet" was presented. This upper
stage is the monument where Cleopatra
takes refuge. Antony is lifted up to her
from the floor of the back stage that he
may die in her arms.
The doors which lead from the back
stage into the "tiring house" sometimes
come into the action. For example, they
represent the gates of CoriolL Throush
one of these Caius Marclns enters the city
alone and then fights his way out again
covered with blood, thus inspiring his fol
lowers to capture the city and winning
for himself the proud name Coriolanus.
These same doors are the gates of many
different castles and cities in the plays
which are named from the various Eng
lish Kings.
In the last act of "The Tempest." where
Prospcro "discovers (that is, discloses)
Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess,"
we are to understand that he draws back
the side curtains, which up to that mo
ment had shut off the back stage, in order
that the King of Naples and hi3 nobles
may behold the lovers.
place. As soon as one scene was complet
ed by the going oft of the characters a
new set of persons could at once enter,
and the audience would imagine any de
sired change of scene, provided only that
the action was still in the open air. Thus
the many short scenes in the first part of
"Coriolanus," In which bands of Roman
and Volscian warriors come before us al
ternately, were presented with a sim
plicity, rapidity and effectiveness that our
stage knows nothing of. Our editors of
Shakespeare are sometimes too anxious
to give an exact location to each of these
front scenes. The audience understood
them to be enacted "in an open place." or
simply "out of doors."
The special use of the back stage was
to represent a room in a palace or prince
ly house. Upon this portion of the stage
use was made of a few appropriate articles
of furniture and other "properties." The
walls were hung with arras, behind which
Falstaff ensconces himself on one occa
sion nnd Polonius on another. In "Romeo
and Juliet" the back stage represents the
great reception hall of Capulet. In act
five it was transformed into the tomb of
the Capulets. Domestic scenes were acted
upon this back stage. Here appeared Lady
Percy. Calphurnia. both Portias and all
the other noble women of Shakespeare,
closing with Imogen, Hermtone and Queen
Katharine.
Â£100.000. Plays written expressly for thÂ»
modern stage are more cautious in. the
demands that they make.
Undoubtedly sometimes Shakespearo
went too far in breaking up the action of
a drama into separate, scattered scenes,
but in his greatest works all the parts oj
the play should be presented and the cor
rect order of the scenes is a necessary
part of the effect. The order of the sep
arate short scenes in the fifth act of
"Macbeth" is a definite part of the dra
matic effect.
Shakespeare's plays were constructed
for Shakespeare's theater; they are falsi
fied when presented to an audience in an
entirely different manner. This fact has
come to be recognized more and more and
various attempts have been mace to rem
edy the difficulty. A number of Eliza
bethan plays have been presented by th-j
students of Harvard University during
recent years upon a stage especially con
structed in the Elizabethan fashion.
Since 1S95 the Elizabethan Stage Society
of London has presented a number of
Elizabethan plays In the Elizabethan
manner. But the only important attempt
to appeal to the general public by means
of a reformed method of presenting 1 the
plays of Shakespeare has been made in
Munchen. Since 1SS3, except for aa Inter
val of two years, the plays of Shakespeare
have been frequently acted there upon A
specially prepared stage. Only such omis
sions are made in the text as good, tasta
demands. The stage is not a strict imi
tation of the Elizabethan but is said to
resemble it in the more important feat
ures. Only a moderate use is made of
stage furnishings and decorative effects.
The element la kept subordinate. TherÂ»
are no waits between ;he scenes and only
slight ones between *.he acts. The spe
cially prepared stage employed at Mun
chen is called "die Ghakespepje-Buhne"
the Shakespeare stage. Many lovers of
Shakespeare In Germany are enthusiastic
over this reform. They insist that a whole
play of Shakespeare â¢ makes a very dif
ferent Impression from the selected parts
and tableau effects to which the modern
stage has accustomed us. The Shakes
pearean presentations at Munchen offer
an abunranee of pleasure and instruction
for the students ot the great dramatist.
The peculiar feature In the mechanism
of the Shakespeare-Buhne Is said to be
that one movable back stage can be sec
in order while another is being- used: each
of these back parts can.be moved m be
hind the permanent forward portion of
the stage when it is wanted.
The Important facts are that Shakes
peare's plays are given at Munchen In
full, without -waits, and with only a mod
erate amount of stage iurnl3hin|T. The
accent Is put upon the acting end elocu
tion and not upon the scene painting' and
rich setting. Judging by the reports the
experiment Is a success, popularly, edu
cationally and financially. Would that
America mlsht honor In a similar way
the memory of the great poet!

TOWARD THE UNITED STATES
AN excellent programme, excel
lently rendered, was that given
last evening by the Royal Ma
rine Band of Italy at the Cali
fornia Thenter to only a fairly
large but wildly enthusiastic audience.
We have heard much of this famous or
ganization and of Its work here and there
in the great cities, but Its performance
certainly surpasses even the most hope
ful expectations. The personnel of the
band is unique and peculiar to those ac
customed to the make-up of the American
brass band. There is not a single cornet.
There are twelve or sixteen clarionets,
and the rest of the instruments are most
ly trumpets and horns. But the tone
produced is most beautiful. The reed
winds have almost the supple and pene
trating quality of violins, and the brass
is mellowness itself, round, flexible, deli
cate and of wonderful climax. The tone
color has been carefully considered; the
shading, attack, phrasing and rhythm are
all excellent, and the movements go with
delightful swine and vim.
There are fifty-five members In the
band and among them twenty soloists. Of
these latter appeared last evening Slgnor
Setaro, harpist; Slgnor Tavani, trumpet;
Dl Girolamo, trumpet; Creatore, trom
bone, and De Titta, barytone horn.
Signor Setaro is undoubtedly one of the
best harpists whom we have had out
here. He has an extraordinary technique
and gives theâ unfortunatelyâ somewhat
meretricious compositions which form the
bulk of the literature of the harp with
facile grace.
The trombone player. Slgnor Creatore,
is another line artist, with a, rare sym
pathy of execution, beautiful tone and
thorough command of all the resources
of his Instrument. He plays on the old
fashioned key tromboneâ there is not a
slide trombone in the bandâ and in his
work approaches marvelously near the
human voice. Tavani was accorded an
enthusiastic encore for his rendering of
the "Inflammatus," and Slgnor Giannini.
tenor of the troupe, gave much pleasure
with his chosen selection. Di Girolamo
took effective part with Creators and De
Titta in the fourth act of "Travlata,"
and the latter number pleased almost
more In this arrangement than with its
original vocal and scenic accessories. An
act of "Gioconda" was also given, and
some good compositions by Slgnor Mino
llti. the distinguished leader of the band.
An entirely new programme will t be
given this evening. The band is booked
for a two weeks' stay at the California.

The people In the neighborhood of 117
Fan Pablo avenue witnessed the rcmark

In a wheel chair, chasing his wife and
nephew out of the house at the point of
a pistol. The man was AdoJph Heine,
who keeps a small bakery at that num
ber, and who has been arrested a number
of times in the past for peddling lottery
tickets In violation cf the law.
Heine is a familiar character on the
Streets of Oakland. Â»He has entirely lost
the use of his lower limbs, and has an
old-fashioned wheel chair, operated by
hand, in which he makes his way about
the city. When the lottery business was
brisk In Oakland Heine did a. thriving
trade in the forbidden tickets, but of
late years he has been forced, partly bv
the police and partly by a falling off in
the demand for lottery tickets, to aban
don that business and turn his attention
to selling doughnuts to the denizens of
6an Pablo avenue.
This afternoon Heine Imbibed too free
ly. He had been making a trip about
town and his wheel chair was apparently
jio bar to his entering saloone, for he ar
rived home In a decidedly intoxicated
condition. He made his way Into his
house and entered Into an altercation
with his wife.
Heine drew a revolver, which he always

Before 1SSS cur knowledge of the interior
arrangement of an English theater during
the lifetime of Shakespeare was very
vague. In that year a German scholar
named GaÂ»dertz published a facsimile of a
pen and Ink drawing of the interior' of
the famous Swan Theater. This drawing
was made by a Dutchman named John de
Witt, who was visiting In London, and It
Is thought to belong to about the year
1596. The Swan Theater was built about
1593 on the Bankside, the sjouth side of the
Thames. When new it was the finest of
the London theaters.
It will be seen that the theater Is either
oval or circular in shape; that the body
of the house and the front of the stage are
open to the sky; and that the back of the
stage and the thret galleries, which rise
one above another on the outside of the
theater, are roofed over. These galleries
are divided into private boxes. The spec
tators In the pit or yard in front of the
stage stood while witnessing the perform
ance.
A roof covers the hinder part of the
stage. Perched up on top of this roof is
a small tower room, -which Is the loftiest
portion of the entire theater. In the draw

known fact among physicians that cx-
cminatlon of perspiration and urine will
tell whether the individual has been act-
ively using the brain or not.
Brain work exhausts the phosphates
which appear in the excreta above men-
tioned. Administration of inorganic
phef phorus or phosphates docs not read-
ily supply the waste, for nature de-
mands that the phosphates be made up
r.n<3 blended in the food which she fur-
nishes. Advantage has been taken of
tl.'s knowledge and a scientific selection
Â« f part of the grain has been made, and
these have been put through mechanical
processes parallel to the processes
through which food is passed In Its man-
agement by the human digestive organs.
Therefore, the new food is not only
ready to serve without cooking, but it
has parsed through the process where
the starches have been changed to grape-
Fupar, and that with the protfld?, or-
ganic phosphates, etc.. are at once ready
to be quickly absorbed and turned to
use in vitalizing and nourishing the parts
of the body like brain, solar plexus, and
tfce delicate nerve centers.
The new food has been given the name
of Grape-Nuts, and far from being a
"Crank's Food," "Invalid's Food." or
cnythlng of that sort., it is a crisp, sweet
novelty, charming to the athlete, train

WEATHER CONDITION'S AND GENERAL.
Touching the Naval Academy. It is
urged that no physical disqualifications of
cadets shall be wal%'ed hereafter* as there
has b?en a marked deterioration in the
past ten years in the physical condition of
the graduating cadets, owing to their
abandonment of the vigorous "weeding
out" process, which has now fallen Into
disuse. It is also strongly urged that the
two years' supplemental course at sea
shall be abandoned. Flnallv strong recom
mendation is piven to the superintend
ent's recommendation that the age limit
for cadets upon admission shall bo be
tween the ages of 15 and IS. and that the
course at the academy shall be four years
Two additional training ships for ap
prentices at Newport are said to be ur
gently needed. The report ur^ed continued
training of the men In marksmenship.
The admiral makes a strong point In his
report of the necessity of naval barracks.
A mild reproof on Conf ress is contained
In the closing paragraph of the report
which calls attention to the discouraging
condition in which distinguished officers
of the navy have been left by not leceiv
ing any formal recognition for their he
roic services during the war with Spain.
The report says that the navy had no part
in the unfortunate public controversy
which followed upon the President's rec
ommendation that certain officers should
be promoted, and adds tnat thus far there
haa been no recognition by Conjrress ex
cept of those who shared in the victory at
Manila and those who served elsewhere in
the war.
There were 2<S2 desertions from the naw
and 86 deaths during the past fiscal year.
The enlistment* number 8123 from a total
number of applicants of 40.S36. Over 6s per
cent of the men in the navy are native
born. 19 pÂ«r cent are naturalized and 9 per
cent have declared intentions. Xlnety-two
per cent of the landsmen now under
training are native-born.
Admiral Crowninshield finds that the
Chesapeake is too small for the midship
men, and asks that she be transferred to
the training station at Newport and that
another vessel be built for the cadets, to
accommodate tt least 30) besides her
crew.
One chapter ceals at some length with
the history of the Asiatic station during
the year and the participation of the navy
and marine corps in the Chinese opera
tions are set out in some detail. The re
port makes the point that the Government
should construct or acquire on the Asiatic
station a dock of its own.
The training system as now practiced in
the navy is commended, and It ia declared
that by no other means could the navy
tsecure the sailors necesiary to man the
fleet. Since the close of the Spanish war
the department has found that tne re
sources heretofore depended on to furnish
seamen for the navy are no -longer ade
quate. Only 237 seamen have enlisted for
the first enlistment in the past year, so
the department has been obliged to rely
upon and develop the training squadron
for landsmen, r.nd now has about 1000 m^n
under instruction, who on the average,
require about six months' training.
Admiral Crownlnshield regards It as
most important commercially that we
keep always a fair representation on the
South Atlantic station, saying that in no
part of the world are our vessels more
cordially received, and nowhere can be
traced direct benefits to trade more clear
ly than on this station. As to Xortt* At
lantic stations, regret Is expressed that
the important drills of the squadron are
compelled to be often Interrupted by at
tendance of vessels at local celebrations,
which tend to demoralize the efficiency of
the personnel.
The admiral severely criticises the inef
fective effort of Congress at the last ses
sion to njeet immediate needs for officers
by authorizing the employment of retired
officers, and he demands the Immediate
repeal of that act. He claims that the
retired list. Intended as the reward for
faithful service, otherwise becomes a
hardship and a punishment. The person
nel act thus far has resulted in affording
less officers than were on the active list
before its passage, as. while authorizing
an increase, it .failed to provide the means
therefor, so there are now 131 vacancies in
the list of naval officers, when vacancies
can be least afforded. Therefore it is
recommended for the nejtt ten years that
appointments to the Naval Academy be
doubled, the President and Representa
tives in Congress appointing two instead
of one wherever authorized now. and in
addition Senators being given the same
privilege of appointment as Representa
tives. Then, to meet future needs, it is
recommended that whenever Congress
authorizes an Increase of vessels in the
navy it also provide in the same act for
an Increase of officers and men to man
the ships. The report says that England,
which this year lays down fifteen .war
vessels, voted an increase of 4M0 officers
and men to the naval establishment to
man the ships, while Germany, which in
tends doubling her fle^t in the next six
teen years, has provided In the same pro
gramme for Increasing the personnel for
Â£5 officers and 10>5 men, until the total in
crease reaches S5.551. It Is declared that
it is now impossible to man the vessels of
our navy already constructed with the
present force, r.ot to mention those build
ing or authorized. Congress is urged to
make any increase in the personnel im
mediately .available.
The Naval Academy is insufficient for
Â¦want of Instructors, and the present high
standard of training cannot be main
tained, rh-ery bureau in the department
is short of officers, and the. service, the
report predicts, soon will fall behind in
the struggle, first for leadership and then
for quality, with the other services. The
disability of the sea-going corps of of
ficers has grreatly increased since the
Spanish war, and many of the best officers
are being lost as a result of breaking
down from overwork.
The admiral regards this need of the
navy for officer* and men as most urgent.
He says that the bureau can point to
many cases where the service is being
harmed by lack of officers.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â The startling:
statement is made In the report of Ad
miral Crownlnshield, chief of the Naviga
tion Bureau, that the present personnel of
the navy would form barely one-fourth oi
the total establishment necessary to fight
a first-class European power. It barely
sufficed fcr the Spanish war, and no long
er can be considered, the report saya. as
an effective nucleus about whiph a larger
establishment could be formed in case of
war.
Can Point to Places Where the Ser
vice Is Being Seriously Impaired
by Lack of Trained
Men.
Says Attention Should Bs
Paid to This Matter
at Once.

EX-POLICE CAPTAIN DOUGLASS
IS CALLED TO HIS LAST REST
WILLIAM Y. DOUG
u LASS, a ' '43 pioneer, and for
B . thirty-seven years a member of
\ ti^y the San Francisco Police De
partment, during most of which
time he acted as an executive officer, died
at his residence, 137 Beulah street, yes
terday afternoon after a lingering illness.
Five years ago Captain Douglass was re
tired from the police force. He had
grown old In the service, and. the Police
Commissioners having: decided to Infuse
younger blood Into the executive ranks ot
the department, it fell, to him and Cap
tains Short and Stone to be placed on the
pension list.
At first the veteran was determined to
oppose the action of the Commissioners,
but finally retired to private life.
Captain Douglass was . an inveterate
smoker, and soon after his retirement be
came afflicted with smokers' cancer. An
operation wa3 performed on his throat,
but the malady had taken a strong hold
and the use of the knife had been resorted
to too Jate. Physicians could give no re
lief, and for the past few years the vet
eran knew that death was near and but a
ques;ion of time. Up to the last he re
tained his faculties, and until quite re
cently would take his dally wa'lk about
Golden Gate Park near his home.
Captain William Y. Douglass was born
In ;\ew Ycrk June 30, lSit*. He chose a
eeafarir.g life, and on August 1, 1SÂ«, ar
rivt',i at this port as second mate of the
8h 'P I'acifie. anions the passenpers of
which were R. H. Miller Jr., Mark Hop
kins and Arthur M. KDbetts.
Becoming seized with the gold fever, as
was usually the case in those days, Doug
lass went to Mormon Island, on the Amer
ican River, and took a hand at placer
mining. He fell yick and returned to
the city. He took command of a vessel
cn a voyage to the Sandwich Islands and
back. That ended his seafaring life. On
December IS. TSo6. he was appointed to
the police force. In less than two years
afterward, on August 16. 185S. he was
promoted to the position of captain, whicii
he held continuously until July 31. 18Hi>,
when he was retired on a pension by the
Board of Police Commissioners.
On the I4th day of the month following
his retirement Captain Douglass was pre
eented with a diamond ring and a pouch
containing $500 by Sergeant Birdsall, on
behalf of the members of Company A. In
thanking tbe men for their testimonial
Captain Douglass refered to his long ser
vice in the department of thiry-slx yeais,
eleven months and fourteen days. He had
in that period experienced pleasant times
and disagreeable times, he said. He had,
he supposed, been rough with the boys,
at times, but he could only say it was for
their own good, and not for personal rea
sons.
Captain Douglass had grown up with
the department, and had never be^n
ashamed to say that he belonged to it.
"I wae dropped from the roll." said the
ex-captain. "I could not conscientiously
resign, as It would have been an acknowl
edgment that I was either mentally or
phyEically disqualified, which I consider I
am not. I shall always be with you 11.
epliitv My sympathies shall always bo
with the department, wherever I may be."
At the conclusion of the speech the com
pany Joined in singing "Auld Lang Syne,"
and as each man shook bands with him
Â¦Jn turn the retired captain broke down
completely.
Captain Douglass made many Important
arrests during his long: service as an of
ficer. He was In the posse which captured
tbe notorious Brotherton brothers, who
DESPERATE BUT VAIN EFFORTS OF TWO BURGLARIOUS COOKS
TO ESCAPE FROM PURSUING SPECIAL POLICEMEN HARPER
AND LAMBERT, AFTER ROBBING A BOX CAR. *
which they had just been caught In the
act of vlolatlns.
Special Policemen Harper and Lambert
were patroling their beats in the vicinity
of Fisherman's wharf at 3:30 a. m., when
their attention was attracted to a box
JOHN BRADY and Edward Shea,
cooks by occupation but burglars
from choice, took an early morning
plunge Into the cold waters of the
bay yesterday In a vain effort to es
cape from the clutches of the law,
By this time Policeman Edner, attracted
by the shots, arrived on the scene and
sent In a call for a patrol wagon. The
half-drowned prisoners were hurried to
the City Prison, where, after belnjc
charged with burglary, they were stripped
of their wet clothing and given blankets
to keep them from freezing while their
wearing srpparel was being dried out. For
several hours the discomfited prisoners
sat around on the cell benches swathed In
blankets like Egyptian mummies in ap
pearance, and as uncommunicative."
Harper and Lambert were astonished at
their unexpected action, but immediately
took steps to rescue the rash burglars,
and by prompt work soon landed them
both on terra firma once more.
The two thieves dashed down the near
est wharf with their pursuers close at
their heels, and arriving at the end
plunged Into the bay without the slightest
hesitation.
The two specials quickly unllmbered
their artillery and started In pursuit. They
shouted to the fleeing thieves to atop, but
Brady and Shea were In a hurry and paid
no attention to the command; neither did
they pay any attention to the bullets that
were sent whistling over their heads other
than to accelerate their speed. They threw
away a number of cans of condensed milk,
which they had stolen from the car, in
their efforts to escape, but finding that
the policemen continued to gain on them
they suddenly turned and made directly
for the water.
car on the Santa Fe Company's tracks,
which had been broken open. As they
were approaching the car to continue their
Investigation Brady and Shea jumped out
an* started to run.
Police Officer T. J. Connell of the Mis
sion division has added one more notch
to hts record by the capture of a street
robber. Shortly after midnight yesterdaj
morning Connel!, while patrolling his beat
on Mission street, near Eleventh, saw a
lady running; alter a rasai who was ungal
lanily trying to Ret away from her. Con
r.ell joined in the chase and after a sharp
run of three blocks overhauled the fugi
tive on Natcma Ftreet, near Tenth.
The runaway, on being confronted with
the lady, v,-ho cave her name as Mrs. F.
G. McCann, residing at Twelfth and How
ard streets, was identified as the one who
had snatched frcm her hand a purse con
taining $1 10. On beins: searched at the
Seventeenth-street station the purse and
10 cents were found on him. The $1 was,
however, missing.
The thief grave the name of Hugh Tier
nan and stated that he was a painter by
trade. A charge of robbery was placed
against his name on the prison register.

John Brady and Edward Shea Fished Out of the
Water and Locked Up at City Prison.
It is almost certain that coal gas had
accumulated in the coal bunker, for the
place is practically air tight, and that late
at night, under some unusual strain, the
fuses burnt out, the spark firing the gas,
the resulting explosion shaking the
ground and bursting everything in its
way.
Such an explosion has happened in the
vaults of electric companies in one or
two instances. The last one was at one
of the "central" stations. Some gas had
accumulated, a fuse burned out, the
spark fired the gas and the explosion,
having no other way to waste its force,
blew the manhole cover fifty feet into the
air. That was a small explosion; the one
yesterday morning was a big one.
Yesterday morning the place was a
wreck. The force of the explosion had
blown the deadlights out of the sidewalk,
leaving a hole four feet square opening
into the coal bunker below. It also blew
coal all over the basement. It burst in
the door of a closet beyond the elevator
shaft, and then rushing through a door
way in the concrete bulkheads, it burst
In the doors of some lockers fifty feet
away from the coal bunker. It reached
into one of these lockers and took a steel
tool from where ft rested and flung It
clear across the room. It tore off the
door at the head of the stairway and
flung it half way up the flight of marble
steps that leads to the second floor of the
building. It burst in the big double doors
leading from the vestibule into the big
office on the first lloor and broke the
glass panels in the doors. It blew out
the big semi-circular transom above the
main doorway, broke the glass panels of
the main doors and strained their locks
to the breaking point. It burst in the
lower end of the elevator shaft and it
carried dirt and coal dust up the shaft
until it bespattered the walls at the
eighth floor. .
The cause of it all, according to gen
eral belief â the converter â is about the
only thing around the place that was not
moved or apparently damaged. It Is a
solid iron box standing about four feet
high, eighteen inches wide in one direc
tion and two feet in the other. The lid
ia a solid iron plate. At 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon the lid was lying askew
on top of the converter. Some people
who saw It thought it had been blown
off, but it was not. Two eye bolts held
It in place, and these were lying on top.
Their threads wwe. uninjured; had the
top been blown off they would have been
stripped smooth as a turned bolt unless
the bolts themselves broke. But the bolts
did not break, nor did the lugs into which
they screwed; nor were the screw threads
In the luga stripped or broken. It was
apparent that some one had unscrewed
the bolts and had taken off the lid of the
converter, perhaps to look into it. and if
some one had had to take off the lid of
the converter, how was it that the thing
-exploded with such force as to blow doors
oft their hinges, burst holes in the side
walk and scatter coal dust all over the
building?
Had those who Investigated looked a bit
further they would have seen on the wall
above the converter a switch plato wUh
three wires running over it, with no fuse
on two of them and but a remnant on the
third.
The converter rests under the sidewalk,
occupying part of one of the compart
ments between the concrete arches; the
remainder of the compartment is occu
pied by a coal bin in which are four or
five tons of coal. The compartment has
no ventilation except through the door
way that leads into the basement proper,
and its walls are of concrete. There Is
an elevator well next to the coai bin,
closed at the sidewalk with Iron doors.
These were bolted. The only other open
ing into the basement is a door opening
into the vestibule of the building on the
Sansome-street side and reached from the
engine room by a narrow stairway. The
engine room contains the elevator hoists*
two accumulator tanks for supplying
pressure to the elevator rams, and the
boiler.
Â¦ The cause of the explosion that occurred
in the basement of the Mutual LJfe
building. California and Sansome streets,
at 1:30" o'clock yesterday morning, shak
ing the entire neighborhood and creating
the impression that some one had tried
to blow up a safe, Is still a mystery.
Fire Marshal Towe believes that the
"converter," an instrument used to regu
late the electric current from the main
line as it flows to the lights in the build
ing, exploded. This theory would- prob
ably explain the situation If it were not a
fact that the converter is still Intact and
for the further fact that electricity does
not explode; it may burn and flash, but it
never explodes, and the wreck of the
basement of the Mutual Life building is
undoubtedly the result of an explosion of
tremendous force.
Police and Firemen Believe It Was
Caused by Electricity, but Coal
Gas May Be Respon
sible.
Strange Upheaval In Mutual
Life Building Still a
Mystery.
