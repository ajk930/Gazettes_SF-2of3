were all the wild animals you could wish

thanksgiving story the minute you come
In." > '
All the eajne, '.It was late that, night:
before' I heard it. The household was
asleep, andl was lingering on the veran
da enjoying the" harbor view, of which
1 never tire! Cousin Maggie has about tht>
most romantic. dressmaker's soul I ever
read of and she Insists on dragging her
customers up the slopes of Telegra'ph Hill

without harbor breezes and harbor beau
ty. Privately I suspect her of another
She likes'to watch the "snips and
be the first to spy out Cousin John's
steamer as he plies up and dewn. Well.
I was staring at Alcatraz, ' which Iook3
'like a castellated rock in, the moonlight,
thinking sentimentally of all the poor'
prisoners there, when Maggie came along
and eat down in the rocker beside me.
"Thought I'd forgotten your story?" she
asked, "not a. bit: of it! but it's a scrap
of my youthful romance I'm giving you
and I don't -feel like telling It with folks
hustling 'around."' - _ ' >
"It'a , the elephant, "Maggie," I cor

She laughed her blithe laugh. "Oh, I
began with dolls. When I came to Cali
fornia from the Bast because I was going
to die of consumptionâ so the, doctors said"
âI had to earn a little. ; Grandmama had
taken me In eagerly, but the home was
not rich and ' It wasn't fair ! to stay Idle.
Now I had always been clever with my
needle, Â¦especially; for bazaars and that
sort of thing and though I couldn't trust
"The back was nice and broad, you
- know. I had lost my fear of slipping
oft and I wanted my joke; cutting out
on an elephant's back seemed a thing
to boast of. Tiddles was quiet, too. though
he seemed a bit uneasy. I took my
length and breadth measurements all
right and then I began to wriggle for
ward gingerly toward the head. It
struck me that Tiddles didn't like it. but
I wasn't going back upon rryself.*. so I
took the scissors out of their sheath and
unfolding my bit of cloth, flung it be
tween his ears. Suddenly I felt 'a quiver,
saw his trunk slowly curl up and there
was ray cloth flourishing In the air! They
all screamed with laughter and never no
ticed my fright and in another minute
the trunk curled up again. I dropped the
scissors on his head in my scare and how
he reached them goodness .mows, but
they were picked off, too. And then, my
dear, just as I was sliding back to the
ladder with the biggest palpitations I
ever had In my life, up comes that blessed
trunk once more and winds round my
waist. I yelled, the men swore, but Tid
dles took no notice: he just lifted me
quietly, swung me twice in the air, let
me aown softly almost to the ground and
then, before any one could sav Jack Rob
inson he had me back on my perch again.
Oh, you may laugh. Nora, but it was the
biggest fright I ever had; I did no more
dressmaking that day.
"Well, next morning the manager him
self came. 'Miss Mason,' he Â¦ said, 'If
you'll do that trunk trick with Tlddle-j
every night I'll treble your salary. *v â¢!
,".'No, sir,' I cried, 'not for six times the
salary! I couldn't stand It: why, it makej
me tremble now to think how I felt' at the
time.' 'And I was trembling, too.
"'Nonsense, my girl.' he said, kindly
enough, 'y.ou would soon get used to It;
there's not a particle -of danger and you
know you'll be glad of the money.
' " 'I'll undertake to train Tiddles so that
he 'shall do It quite naturally,' argued
Mr. Dudley, who was with him. 'and I'll
always be there to watch and catch you
If you are, frightened. I could have made
him drop you In ray arms If I hadn't been
bo taken by surprise yesterday/ .

j " 'Turkish costume is very becoming to
ladles with â¢ small feet,' commented Mr.
Dudley. Now I'm proud of my feet,
Nora.
"'took here.' clinched t.ie manager, 'I
want that trick introduced as a Thanks

you a whole fortnight for daily practice

this very minute. What's jnore. you may

."â¢But I'm scared!' I protested, looking
from one to the other.
â¢' 'Have a care. Miss Mason,' said Mr.
Dudley as I scrambled up. 'Tlddles Isn't
Â¦vicious, but he likes his fun,*
' " 'All right.'" I called, let him have It.
Hand me up the scissors and that piece
of stuft for the hood, please. I'll cut I*
right away on his back.
' "Uniph," answered Maggie, "you young
people are so mighty knowing nowadays!

Dudley was as nice as possible, he al
ways scared me a bit. So you may
Imagine how I felt when he came to me
"one morning and said, 'Miss Mason, we
want new coats and hood%, for the ele
phants â nice scarlet ones.'
" 'The elephants,' I gasped; 'how on
earth am I going to fit an elephant?'
. " 'Bless my soul,' he answered, 'it'a easy
enough, with a ladder, of course.*
' "Well, I wasn't really a timid girl and I
knew the elephants for kind, comfortable

who clustered aroui\d, thinking It a good
joke,- watched me -and gave every help,

down, jset'lf'just at the right angles â you
see, I could not measure him all at once â
.-. and Vulcan was as good as gold. So was
Venus, so was Napoleon-, and by the time
It -got to- Tiddley winks' turn I had grown
quite bold. Tiddleywinks was, by way of
being the baby, a frisky big fellow whom
everybody petted and who had never in
his life done an ill turn. 'I believe I'll
manage this boy without any trouble," I
cried merrily, 'you need not move the lad
' der at all.' .
"I know. Cousin Maggie." I said nod
ding, my head, "you were falling In love."
'.â¢His best must have been of some use.
for they took me on. It was only a
weenie bit of a salary, but I tell you. Nora,
there wasn't a girl In San' Francisco who
had a better time. ,1 was always fond of
animals" (she s need not have mentioned
â¢ that; Maggie's pets are a positive
nuisance) "and I got along famously." I
made downright pictures of the' monkeys
and the dogs, I dressed up the goat
chaises, I Invented ruffles for the pen
guins; you: wouldn't believe the notions
. that came into my head, and . I didn't
, spend much of^their money either; I used
up all sorts of odds and ends. When
there was nothing to do for the animals
. there was always plenty of mending and
patching for the men and I had enough on
my hands, but It wasn't hard work and
I had always time for my fun with all
those dear live things. I never tired of
them! The big brown bear was my great
chum and I had quite a romantic affection
- for the lions. But somehow I couldn't
get over my awe oÂ»Mr. Dudley and his
elephants; they all seemed too far
above me."
"He thought it a good Idea- *But I can't
give you an answer.' he explained, - 'the
manager Is away; I'm only the elephant
man newly arrived with my beasts and
hardly know the ways of the place yet.
But it strikes me they need somebody of
the kind: anyway I will try to do my
best for you.

asked for the manager. One of his assist
ants was calledâ a tall, fair. blu*-eye<l
young man with a fresh- color and an
English accent. I took a fancy to him at
once, being little and dark myself, but *'l
the same he made me nervous and I couU
hardly get out what I wanted to say. for
he . was smiling, under his mustache all
the time. But i said it.
>" 'Hallo. Tid.' he said*, opening the door.
'are you all right, old boy? I thought I
heard you making some queer noise.
Here's a bun for you.' ;
"Dear old TM took the bun, and then. If
you'll believe me. he twisted his trunk with
It up to me, just as If he knew I was
hungry. 'Why,' cried Dudley, sharply,
peering, through the half-light, 'what's
that;- who's there?*

"But Mike had seen to that. He had
'privately, prooured red cloth and gold
braid from a draper friend, and pleaded
hard- "You see. It's been done to do ma
. mischief.' he said. 'I shall get discharged
for carelessness".' - . . Â¦ .
"Now, Mike had always been extra nice
to me, and he had a sick wife. Besides
my vanity was hurt on Tiddles' accountf
so I just told grandmama there was no
help for Itâ I would dine at 'the gardens
with the rest. And off I went. Mike got
me into the elephant house and up on
Tiddles' back without anybody seeing, and
I set to work. You see. I was quite at
home there now. I knew It could only be
slop work, but I cut out and basted quick
ly, meaning to finish off properly next
day. I was nearly through, and Mike was
grinning at me gratefully, when we heard
Madame Colombe's voice. 'Mike. Mike: I
want you. Mike, with the ladder. Three
of -my pigeons have got away In a tree/
He looked at me uncertainly.
" 'Mike,' I cried,' in a panic, 'you must
not leave me here wlthÂ»TlddleywInka and
-no' ladder. I won't hear of It/
- "He scratched his head, and Madame
called again. 'I won't be but a minute or
two,' he said. "You see, she wants U for
herself: the birds will only come to her.
But I'll be back before you've finished/
. ."I didn't half like it. but I was a bit
ashamei to say more, so I basted away
and patted Tlddleywinks and told him
how nice. we should both look a few hours
later. By and by I had no more basting
to do. It seemed an awful long time since
Mike had gone away. It was a raw, fog
gy day, and It began to get dark In that
elephant house, and I felt very lonely and
cold up- ihere pn Tiddles' back. I was
getting, hungry, too. and could have cried -
thinking of them all at home round my
Thanksgiving dinner. "l didn't dare to let
the elephant lift me down with nobody
there, though â¢ I dare say I could have
made him understand. Besides, I should
only have been -v^brse off. for his house
was small and \he door was always kept
locked. Well. Nora, I told you girls were
sillier then than now. and the end of It
was, that I broke right down and had a
real, good. cry all to myself; It wasn't to
myself either, for Tiddlfts put up his
trunk and touched me Â«rently. just as if
he understood. All of a sudden I heard a
step on the gravel outside, and Tlddley
wlnka heard too. and trumpeted. I knew
what that meantâ Mr. Dudley was there!
I wanted to scream to him, but I was so
ashamed of being caught crying like a
baby that I didn't like to, and I just held
on to Tldd!es- Â¦ . '^â¢'
"Well. now. you would hardly believe
how used Tlddleywlnks and I got to each
other In that fortnight! We had our prac
tice every morning before the visitors
came, and he learned to watch for me and
the cakc3 I brought him. and I ended by
not minding a bit being swung up and
down, so long as there was somebody
watching. I couldn't bring myself to trust
Tiddles altogether. My costume turned
out fine, too, and the elephant3 were a
picture In their scarlet. I had trimmed
Tlddleywlnks with gold braid because he
was my particular elephant, and It set
him off. The whole establishment took
an interest In our practice and not a soul
but had a nice word for us, save Madame
Colombe. the pigeon trainer, j She wasn't
any more French than I am. but madams
looks well on a programme and she cer
tainly was the cleverest pigeon trainer I
ever saw. Madame had been very nice tp>
me, too, till the elephant business. Thenl
she turned crusty, but I was too happy
to bother. Everything was ready for
Thanksgiving, and grandmama just
thought me a little angel. We were not
to open till late In the afternoon, after
people had been to church and eaten their
turkeys, and the manager was giving a
big dinner to all hl3 employes. But I was
to dine at home.
"I never tasted that dinner, -though. In
the morning Mike, who looked after tho
elephants, came out to our place with a
scared face to tell me something dreadful
had happened. Tiddles' coat had been mis
laid and when found was all cut to
shreds. I looked blank enough. I can tell
you. '"Why.*- 1 said. ,*we shall have to use
Napoleon's, which won't fit. besides- spoil
ing the set. What a horrid shame!'
"'You couldn't make him .a new one.
miss,* asked Mike, anxiously.
" 'What, before -to-night, and spoil my
day? Besides I can't get the materials.'
"I looked up straight at him with sud
den confidence. 'If you'll promise to take
C&re of me I'll do It,' I said.
'"Don't young: ladles Vant. Thank3glT
. ing bonnets or something, Miss Mason?'
' asked Mr. 1 Dudley. . . !
t'Now, that set me thinking, not about
bonnets, but dinners. â¢ You know we East
erners" set more store by Thanksgiving
than' Christmas^ and -I did not .believe
poor grandmama ccfuld give us a Thanks
giving dinner. -She had said as much,
dear old soul, and she said It with a laugh
< that sounded like a sob. You see she kept
. all my orphan cousins with very llttla
help from the' rest, and she had Just been
slx.'weeks In. the hospital and funds were
- low. Grandmama was onÂ» of the old pio
neers, who. had had'ups and downs, but
she -was always used to her children and
grandchildren eating their Thanksgiving
t dinner with her, and. I guessed she felt
bad- about It. Now, suppose I earned her
the dinner and a new cap Into the bar
gain^ wouldn't that be a nice Thanksglv

COUSIN MAGGIE'S
THANKSGIVING ELEPHANT.down; don't leave me here for anything,'
I added, as I saw him turning at the
door.
" 'I'll be exactly four minutes and a
half. Miss Mason; don't you worry,' he
called back, and I don't believe it was
three minutes before he appeared again
â¢with a. basket. 'Haul that up.' he said to
Tiddleywinks.'
"Well, the basket came up on the trunk,
and I don't believe there ever was such
a Thanksgiving dinnerâ turkey, mince pie
and plumcake nnd candies and everything
else ycu can imagine In a basket. I think
I began with chocolate creams and ended
tvlth caviare; and Tld's wet old nose came
up at Intervals to fetch his share. But, to
be sure, it was rather dry work, and as I
was munching through turkey and tongue
I heard a cork go pop down below. *Oh.
Mr. Dudley,' I said, 'I hope' that isn't real
beer? I dare not take it; I might get gid
dy during the trick.'
" 'It'B champagne," he answered coolly;
â¢you want it after your fright. Here Tid
<Â«leÂ«=âwell, I'm blert. you old rascal; it's
Tiddles that's going to be giddy!'
"You see Tid had remembered an old
trick that he liked and he quietly poured
the champagne down his own throat.
*â¢ 'jCever mind.' I said consolingly, Tid
can stand it better than I could and it's
only fair that he should enjoy himself,
-oo; we've both had a lovely Thanksgiv
ing dinner, thank you.'
" 'Yes, but I haven't,' he retorted.
" 'Good gracious, Mr. Dudley, haven't
you dined at all?*
" 'Not yet; I'm waiting. I don't feel
thankful enough Just at present. Miss
" 'Don't you think you could help me
to feel thankful enough?*.
"I couldn't make him out and said so.
" 'Well, the fact Is.' he explainedâ he
was positively Btammering and that puz
zled me more than anythingâ 'I want a
Thanksgiving present, a greedy, selfish
â¢ort of a present, and I want you to give
It to me.'
'"Oh dear. Is that all?* I cried; 'why
ef course I'd be too pleased to give you '
anything In the wide world that I could.
you've been bo kind to me.'
"And Maggie, my dear, you can go to
bed, now. that you know why we can't
eat that dinner without an elephant"
"Yes it is. John Dudley Porter: he. went
as Dudley for the sake of his people, who
are highfafutfn folk and wouldn't have
liked the elephant business. J-ut he left
after he got his ribs mangled, helping a
friend with the lions. He had had some
seafaring experience and a good educa
tion, and so he slipped into his present
work; as good a skipper as you'll find on
the coast. But. sailor or trainer, no
woman ever had a better husband, and
he Bays lt'o because he ha* Thanksgiving
day always with him. Thank heaven
he'll be back for Thanksgiving dinner!
"But. Maggie,"" I. objected' at last,
"CcuEin John Is a sailor and his name
Isn't Dudle3\" :â¢;';
Cousin Maggie was using her handker
chief suspiciously and the stars gleamed
peacefully over Alcatraz while I sat and
puzzled.
"I caught hold of the dear 'old leatheiy
trunk and: 'I think Tid wants me' was
what I said."
" Tiddles.' he said, fetch lyr down.'
"And before I knew Tlddleywinks ha.1
caught me up and next thing I was in
Dudley's arms. 'Now do you know what
to say?' he whispered; 'is it all right?
Quick, Maggie, quick!'
" 'I mean I don't Know how I ought to
ansv.cr you. I have read' a great many
novels and they all had proposals, but
I never did read of a proposal atop of an
elephant and I really can't tnlnk.'
" 'Eh?'
"Nora, my dear. I was just struck
dumb; I had never been proposed to in
my life, but I felt sure this was a pro
posal and I didn't know how to behave.
I thought I had belter ask him: 'M-.
Dudley.* I said. Ha this really a proposal?'
" 'Well. It isn't a bad imitation, any
way. I am quite in earnest. Maggie.'
" 'But, Mr. Dudley, I don't know what
to tay.'
" 'Mr. Dudley!'
" 'My dear, it's quite true. I've wanted
you from the very first day. I want you
for all your life.'
" *Ah.* he said, rather coldly. I thought,
'is that so? V.'ould you give me any
thing. Miss Mason?
" 'Anything in reason, of course,' I an
swered brisklv.
" 'But I don't want In reason. I pre
fer It In love; you are the present, Mag
gie Mason.'
The fairy then conducted her to the
place*of- honor at the table, and oh. what
a curious assembly was there.
First, there were the Prince and Prin-
any that Helen had ever heard, U was so
delicate and sweet. As the music became
more distinct they knew they must be
petting very near the home of the Star
fish, and soon they were within the pal
ace gates of the Prince and Princess Star
fish. The music swelled into a perfect
flood of melody as they entered the gates.
and' they were met by two ot the cun
ningest little starfish that Helen had ever
seen. She never knew before that fish
could talk; they had the tiniest voices.
These little starfish conducted Helen and
the fain' to the Prince and Princess, who
welcomed them by giving them one of
their points at a time, until they had
shaken them all. "What a funny way to
shake hands," thought Helen.
The palace. was down between two huge
rocks which were completely covered with
pearl, and Hhe Prince touched a hidden
spring somewhere and the palace was
suddenly flooded with the most brilliant
light. It glowed and shimmered on the
pearl, until It fairly dazzled Helen's eyes.
and then she saw quite plainly all the as
sembled guests and the gorgeous furnlsh
â¢ ngs of the palace under the sea.
. There were soft couches of ,green moss
ind cushions of the* most brilliant colors.
Great bushes of. gayly. colored coral grew
here and there and tall trees of feathery
brown swayed In the waves, and the
queerest part of It all" was that these
trees were Just filled with millions of baby
fisTies!. Helen said to the Princess. "Why
do the baby fishes stay in the trees?" and
the, Princess replied. .VTo keep the big,
cruel fish from eating them up." â¢
Helen was glad then that she did not
live In the ocean, where there was dan
ger of being eaten alive.
After a time spent In conversationâ and
ihe tiniest, funniest conversation that
Helen had ever heardâ a fairy announced
that dinner was -served. Helen at once
thought of" her" nightdress, and looking
down was much surprised to see no night
dress at all. but" a beautiful/shimmering
dress of green and silver gauze.

Cousin Maggie's Thanksgiving Elephant
IT wm Thanksgiving night, and Helen
had only been tucked into her little
bed Just a few minutes, when sudden
ly there stood before her the tiniest
fairy one could imagine.
She was all dressed in green and her
hair looked very much like brown sea
weed, and there were ruffles like seafoam
&11 over her dress. She wore a necklace
of the tiniest shells and her slippers of
pearl had the cutest little starfish for ro
nettes. She sml!ed upon Helen, and in a
low. sweet voice chanted:
To the carder.s of the sea
O. ceme with tne.
And a. Thankseivinc dinner
You chs.ll eee.
"To the 'gardens of the sea?* " gasped
poor, frightened Helen. "Do you mean to
the bottom of the big, big ocean?"
"Why, yep." 6ald the fairy; "but you
need fear nothing, for I will protect you."
Saying this, she smiled In such a win
ning ray that Helen's fears were ban
ished.
"Come," said the fairy.
"Why. I cant go in my nightdress, can
I?" said Helen.
"Oh, yes." said the fairy, "for I am go
ing to give you a beautiful dress when we
pet to the bottom of the sea.'*
Then she fastened two of the cutest lit
tle green wings on Helen's shoulders, and
she found herself flying through the air
and out under the bright stars, until they
came to the big, booming ocean. Before
Helen could say anything about being
afraid she found herself down under the
waves, and was surprised to find that sO>Â«?
could see quite as well under the ocean as
she could on the land.
They walked along through the most
beautiful gardens â more beautiful than
any' Helen had ever seen on land, and
Fhe wanted to stop and gather some of
the gorgeous things to take to her mam
ma, but the sea fairy said: "No; we
must hasten to the Thanksgiving dinner
of the Prince and Princess Starfish. I
have told them to expect a little earth
maiden, and you are to be the honored
g-uest."
After passing through thousands of
these sea gardens they hoard the faint
sound of music, but it did not sound like
"With that mamma laughed, and said to
papa: ''Mince piei! Didn't I tell you aoT'
Helen opened her eyes, and looked
around, saying: - "Bat tho Princess Star
fish sent you her recipe for making
mince pies."
Helen knew it must be growing/ late,
so, after the meal was ended and the
music had ceased, and all the baby fish
were fairly tumbling from their seats with
sleepiness. Helen took leave of the kind
Prince and Princess Starfish. and all tho
guests, and the fairy having fastened her
wings on once more, they started for
home. They had not yet reached the fair
world, when Helen was startled by hear
ing a voice, which sounded strangely Iiko
her own mamma's voice, and.lt was say
ing: "I was afraid she would be restless
to-night, when she ate so much of that
mince pie and crab salad to-day. It is a
good thing Thanksgiving comes but once
a year.**
The table was laden with good things,
and Helen liked everything they gave
her, although she had never before tasted
any of these dishes. There was a salad,
made of the sea-lettuce, and all kinds of
queer meat, and something they called
mince pie. which, although It did not taste
at all like the mince pie Helen had eaten
so heartily of at home, that day was
most delicious, and Helen asked the Prin

Just then one of the baby crabs gave ono
of the baby Jellyfish a nudge In the
side, and it hurt so that the gigglins waa
stopped. However, taking It all In aM.*
they behaved so much better at the tab!*
than children on the land that Helen sail
to herself that she would never again be
rude or fault-finding at the table. Thera
were many other families at this Thanks
giving feastâ the Floundersâ the Salmon,
and others, too numerous to mention.
After all were seated, the feast began,
and all the while there was the most
charming music, coming from a tiny or
chestra of fish, concealed In a huge tree.
The flutes were made of dried kelp .and
the violins of tiny shells, with cords of
sea-grass stretched tightly across. These
gave forth the sweetest sounds, and !t
made Helen remark to the Jellyfish who
sat next her: "Oh. I do wi?h mamma
could hear that!" Her voice sounded siÂ»
big that it frightened the baby flan la
the trees, and they all began crying for
their mammas. There was a queer sound
of all the mammas darting from the table.

them that Helen lived on the land, where
everybody talked In that way. and that
she was a good little girl, anc would not
harm them. Quiet was once more re
stored, and she was allowed to talk all
she wished after that. -â¢ Sm'--' : -
Helen ventured to shake hands with,
Mrs. Sea-Anemone, but was sorry she
did. because she took Helen's flncer In
her mouth and squeezed it until Helen
thought she would never see that finger
again. She had to stand there till th<?
Sea-Anemone went to draw a long breath,
and out dropped the finger. After that
she was very carefuj not to shakÂ© hands
with any more of the Anemone family.
They were very nice to look at. but one
Just couldn't be friendly with such people.
Papa and Mamma Jellyfish looked fun
nier than anybody there. Helen thought.
They were* so fat and wobbly, and you
could see right through them. Helen,
couldn't see what they ate. or where they
put It. but they surely must eat some
thing, for they were all fat and wobbly,
and good-natured. They could hardly
keep their places at the table, though,
they were so > sllck, and some of the Jelly
fish children were all the time slipping
off their seats, and under the table, ani
having to be picked up by the tiny sea
falrles who were- In attendance. Then
there were the Sea-Anemones, -which at
first Helen thought were pretty preen and
white sunflowers. When they were sit
ting at the table they looked like flowers,
but as soon as any one would touch them
they would draw themselves up tight,
till they looked Just like soft, green pin
cushions.
The little purple babies of the Sea-
Urchln family got to giggling at the
table, but one look from the papa, and
one shake from his thousand fingers,
made them stop giggling, and look as
sober and demure as It Is possible for a
little Sea-Urchln to look.
The twins sat next their mamma, and
they were no bigger than Helen's thumb
nail. She noticed that they d!d not cry
nor tease at the table, and were- suited
with everything: to which they were
served. It made Helen feel* Just a little
bit ashamed, for she thought that even
a little starfish might teach her some
thing about table manners. Then there
were the Abalone family. They said they
had quite a time to get away from home,
as' they were all stuck so closely to a
rock that they almost broke their beau
tiful shells pulling away from it. Never
theless they were there, and evidently
enjoying: themselves very much. Next
came the Sea-Urchins. O, my! how funny
they lookedâ a great row of them, all cov
ered with sticker?. They were bright red
and purple and brown, and were beau
tiful to look upon, but Helen heard Mamma
Jellyfish whisper to the Princess, and
say: "I would rather not sit next the
Sea-Urchlns. please, because they keep
jabbing me m the sides with their
stfekers." The- Sea-Urchlns Insisted upon
shaking hands with Helen, too. and their
stickers punched Into her soft little hands
so that she was glad when she reached
the end of the row. However, they

THE FISHES' THANKSGIVING
DINNERmil. ANTHONY HOPE gives us a
prychologica! study as his latest
novel. "Quisajite."' He presents
to us a njiiu whose life is de
vcted to political ambition*â a man who
a.t one lime mentally soars far
above the heads of other men and then
spoils all his grand flights the next in-
F:ar.t by seme petty meanness. Qui
sante is, as Hope expresses it, "a
strange, intolerable, vulgar, attractive.
Intermittently Inspired creature, who
presented himself at life's roulette table,
not less various in his own person than
were the varying turns he courted, un
accountable as chance, baffling as fate,
cl'-aiigc-MliIe as luck. Indeed, he was lifce
l!fe Itself. 3 thing you loved and hated.
mw weary of anil embraced, shrank
from ar.d pursued."
The interest of the story is divided be
tween Qulsante and May Gastonâ a
woman of as noble a mind as she is of
birth. And the author depends upon
holding his readers' attention not by his
usual dramatic style of action and incl
uent, but rather by the more intricate.
.and !:: this case hardly so satisfactory,
way of diving deep into the analysis cf
motives.
The present work is uneven. At times
Mr. Hoi>e. if we may borrow the term
frum his Icok. has ins moments and pro
cures an effect, but for the greater part
the Immo-e amount of small talk is drv
and *.riiJiierÂ« sting.
[Ill dial-Tue is i;ot up to Its usual
standard. Often the reader will feel
tempted to put the book aside, and then
continuing will find a chapter which mora
than repays for the sleepy passages.
The opening chapter introduces u* dl
rectiy to yuisanto in the act of manipu
lating an increase in his allowance from
his old mauien aunt. Maria. He is filled
with political aspirations and a!so has
some thoughts of capturing a wife. He
has pueceoded In getting into the inner
circle of English aristocracy through his
remarkable mental abilities and magnet
ism as a speaker and in spite of his in
herent faults of Â»;ot being a gentleman
and rather lacking in the finer sensibil
ities "f honor and honesty. As the
author puts it. he â¢ has at times
"moments"' which carry all before him.
monents when he seems inspired as only
a man of the highest Impulses could be.
moments when he bursts Into such a flood
of oratory that people forget the man
entirely and bow to his great Intellect,
'i he next instant he drops back to his
old self, the man without refinement, the
fawning sycophant. He compels inter
est and admiration, though never a real
liking in the hearts or men nor true love
in women.
He Fucceeds through his powerful per
sonality in winning for a wife a splendid
woman. May Gaston; and the study of
the story is whether this broad-minded
and thoroughly honest and noble woman
will mcoeed in elevating this man or sac
riike her finer sensibilities to his stronger
masculine nature.
She is loved by a man of her own rank
and stationâ a man endowed with all the
refinement and sterling qualities of the
gentleman born: a man who is thoroughly
lovable, but entirely opposite in nature to
all that makes Quisante so impeilttigly
fascinating. She deliberately gives him
up. however, to cast her lot where her
tntehect dictates rather than where her
heart leans.
After marriage this husband and wife
and the rejected suitor are constantly
tnrown together, and it is hardly fo be
expected that for the wife the compari
sons could be ever pleasant.'
"The sight of the two men brought
home to her with a new and an almost
terrible 6harpness the divorce between her
emotional liking and her intellectual in
terest. And in a matter which all expe
rience declared to concern the emotions
primarily she had elected to give foremost
place to the intellect, to suffer under an
ever recurring jar of the feelings for the
6ake or an occasional treat to the brain.
That was her prospect unless she could
transform the nature of Alexander Qul
sante."
Mr. Here, whatever may be said of his
occasionally long and dry conversations.
Is certainly consistent in the development
<jt the characters of May and Qulsante.
He does not overdo either of them. Read
ers who are looking for a heroine with a
broken heart or expecting to see Quisante
take to drink or go to the dogs will be
disappointed. They drift along in a per
fectly natural way. each taking a little
from the best and worst of the other's
nature.
May throws her heart and soul into the
political life of her husband, but can
never accustom herself to the petty dis
honesty and underhand schemes of which
he is constantly guilty. Quisante realizes
all this and hides his shortcomings from
his wife as best he can, but It is bred In
the bone of the man. and it is as impos
sible for him to eradicate the baser parts
of his nature as it is for him to subordi
nate his higher ambitions. A little of the
position each occupies toward the other is
well expressed in the following:
"When he fell in love with May Gaston.
however, part of her attraction for him
had lain in his sense of a difference be
tween themâ of htr grasp on things and
on aspects of things which eluded him;
in this mood he had been prepared . to
worship, to learn, to amend. These things
for a little while he had done or attempt
ed, and had boen met by zealous efforts
to the game end on her part. His great mo
ments had been frequent then, and May
had felt that the risky work that t>he bad
undertaken might prosper and at last be
crowned with uucceES. .As for some
months back this Idea of hers had been
dving, oven so Qutsante's humble morid
filed. ' Now his suspicious vanity saw
blame of what he was. or even contempt
of him. Â¦ in every word by which she
tseemed to invite him to become anything
different. Though she had declared her
eelf on his side by the most vital action
of her life he imputed to her a leaning to
ward treachery; her heart was more with
his critics than with him." Â¦ â¢ ; 'y
Quirante wins his election largely
through an aspersion cast upon the prl-
ate character of his opponent. The scan
dal, as far as the world knows. Is not
BtaitcC by Quisante; he is far too clever
to be found out by any one of importance
vo his cause, with the^ne exception of his
wife, who accidentally discovers the truth.
After the election he devotes himself to
Coaling a business venture, and here suc
ceeds again by the questionable method of
warping the report cf a man who had op
portunely died. Still It must be said in
his Justification that If It had not been
for his great "moments" his failure would
have been certain in both undertakings-
It is only to be regretted that for success
he is obliged to turn to methods impos
sible for a man of honor.
He finally has a stroke, for he Is a man
of no physical strength, which the doctors
declare will prevent him ever again pur
suing an active life. Here the man's won
derful reserve force once more asserts
Itself, and despite the mandate of. the
physicians he delivers the greatest "ora
tion of all that he has ever given, and at
the same time strikes his own deathblow.
He dies at just the right time for a power
ful ending of the story.
The rejected eultor, after a lapse tt
two years after the death of Qulsante,
addresses himself to May. He receives In
Mujy a letter which is one of the best
flmerlcao Jewish Year Book..
The present volume of. the American

Jews In America are interested in the
welfare of their brethren In all parts of
the world, it was deemed advisable to

Valics, or. tbe Science of Value.
Among the new books on. the "money
question" which continue to pour out from
the press under the stimulus of the Pres
idential campaign the most original that
has come to our notice ia a volume enti
tled "Vallcs, or the Science of Value,"
by George Reed. Like most, other original
men who have written on this subject,
the author 'is sure he ha.s solved every
problem connected with finance. He an
nounces in his preface: "We know that
we have thrown light upon the subject of
value, shown the eternal foundation of
science and added power -to the machin
ery that shall yet destroy a great wrong.
We have taken up arms against that men
tal monstrosity, the gold standard, and
we need help."
Mr. Reed defines "vallcs" aa "the sci
ence of value," but he goes on to say that
as value is the medium of exchange
among men, this science could be appro
priately called "the science of commerce
or t the science 'of exchange." The book
shows a great deal of reading' of the
Â¦works of the classic economists, and of
general topics allied to financial questions.
The author holds the opinion the
world is at this time suffering greatly
by reason of bad financial systems and
asserts that the remedy "is to weaken
tho'purchas'.ng power of gold, to cut off
the demand for gold, to cut ufÂ£ the com
mand that gold has over the services of
'men. to make it cheap as measured In
human. effort, which can be done by re
fusing to work for It, and the debts ccukl
be left to go ahead and pay themselves,
which they would do with great accelera
tion."
By way of reducing- the price of gold
he proposes the adoption of sliver as
money. Were that done, he says: "Gold
being of no further use for the purpose
of paying wages would fall Immediately
and we would have rising prices and great
would be the fall of yoid, for it sits ex
alted, raised to that bad eminence through
unjust laws made -for greed and upheld
by folly and Ignorance." (Published by

Sigurd EcRdal's Bride. Â¦
. In "Sigurd. Eckdal's Bride" Richard
Voss ha.i given us a characteristically
Norwegian storyâ unsatisfactory ending
and all. Nanson's expedition to the nortn
pole probably gave the motif for the tale.
It is the story of two men, Svend Hansen
and. his friend Sigurd, who start out in a
balloon for the north pole. Prior to their
sailing aloft, however, it seems that
Maren Allmers, a woman beloved by Han
sen, has fallen in love with Sigurd. Han
son has his head so turned by Jealousy
that on the trip he kills Sigurd and upon
his return swears that Sigurd was a auf
cidc. He succeeds in persuading Maren
.to. become his bride, and while she is true
to him as a wife, still he never whis her
love. At lasi his unhappiness is termln
nted by the losÂ» of his life in rescuing
chiWren from a fire. It is then that the
widow learns the truth, for she finds
among the papers of Hansen evidence tc
convlr.ee .her that Sigurd wns murdered.
An assemblage has gathered to do honor
to the memory of her husband. To this
the goes and announces: .
" "I, Svend Har.stn's widow, accuse my
dead husband of Oik murder of his friend
and my oetrothed lover. Sigurd Eckdul.
I herewith deliver his own confession.'
"She' held m> a srr.all packet of papers."
"With this the story ends. (Published by

teresting period or mere charming place
for a romance than tht beautiful city of
Venice In the . sixteenth century.- Mrs.
Lawrence Turnbuil. in her story. "The
Golden Hook of Venice," knows her his
tory and lier Venice well. She has caught
the coloring and gives exquisite pen pict
ures of this City of the Sra of three hun
dred years ago â lts-tanals, Its gorgeous
palaces, grand churches, broad public
squares and governmental buildings.
The hero, Marcantonio Glustinianl. a
young grandee of the City of the Sea,
marries the daughter ol a wealthy glass
worker, and causes i.er name to be in
scribed, in the LJbro d Oro. which records
only the noble families of the republic.
Marina of Murano is u young woman of
such beauty that Veronese takes her as
the model of a painting of the Madonna.
She is devoted to her husband, but in tha
famous Quarrel between Paul the Pope
and Paul' the Friar, over a ciuestion of
Papal prerogative, ner sympathies ate
with the Papacy as against the republic
and its representative, on whose side h<;r
husband and his family are arrayed. One
of the chief adventurer in the book is the
heroine's flight from Venice as a self-ap
pointed envoy to Rome, with her pursuit
and capture by agents of the Council cf
Ten. Characters of historic Interest, such
as Fra Paolo and Paul Veronese, play
conspicuous parts in the unfolding of tho
plot. -
The story ends with Paul V's removal
of his ineffective edict against Venice â one
of the landmarks In the religious history
of mankind. The cover design, in mosaic,
is stamped In three colors on Venetian

China's Orjly Hope
The Chinese as a race seem to be lack
ing in curiosity, but one of them, a man
by the name of Chan Chih Tung, .Viceroy
of Hunan, has written a book pointing
Â«ut the only method by which China can
be reformed. In It he uses every effort to
Ptimuliite the interest of his countrymen #
in the changes which have been going on '
around them, and tries-." to arouSe' them"
from their apathy by showing the won- j
dors of the world's progress. The book
was so pleasing to the Emperor that, he
caused a million conies of it to be cir
culated throufih the omplrc.
Chang Chih Tung's work Is entitled
"China's Only Hope."
It lias been much advertised as the book
which woke up Chlub and caused the
wonderful reform wave which Is sweep-
Ing over the empire. But the roforrn
movement # ls not new ond the present out
break Is merely the i:ulmir.ation of- a
force which has been t. 'action ever since
the Mongol Invasion; die effort of a sub
jugated race to obtain Its freedom.
The political situation in China is sup
posed to be this: That the ma.1->rlty of the
people are In favor cf a free press,
school? of modern learning, railroads an.l
a navy; that the present Emperor, wh(l3
a Tartar, r? EtllJ In favor of the same
ideas and for that reason the reformers
wish to place him o:i the throne where
he can carry out thÂ«Â» plans which the
Dowager interrupted by deposing him.
Opposed to the Emperor, the reformers
and the people generally, are the Dow
ager and Tartar aristocracy, the mili
tary and the literati, w.io wish everything
to remain as it is. :
"China's Only Hope" Is disappointing
In that it shows Its writer to be more
in ignorance -.if the world than any one
would believe of a Viceroy. ' It is full of
dull saws ar.d .nncien,: Instances. The fol
lowing Is characteristic of what It* says
and the way of saying it:
Generally speaking our Government institu
tion? are used In timea of peace and prosperity
for the rarourasemfnt of learnlnB. and our offi
cials are employed for the maintenance of
rower. Thus by favor of the court the capa
bilities cf the people are enlarged. But when
danger and <llstre*B threaten to overwhelm the
country, the Mandarins maintain a rlifld chas
tity and the people stand ready for her defense.
Great >jlainne?g of Fpcerh is employed by the
counselors of the FOveref&n. and the best wis
dom of the empire is oalied forth to meet, the
issue. There is one great purpose In the hrarts
of rllâ to save the country from corruption,
and the Ftrength of the land is concentrated In
order to guard againtt ths Impending evil. Thuit
th<- resources of the people are exhibtted and
the court is free from anxlous'care. '- â¢
That is the rasy way that Chang Chlh
would pull China through a difficulty and
he calls It the "only hope."
Newspapers are loudly, praised by Mr.
Chang. He says of them. "Matters of dip
lomacy, war, etc.. which our high offi
cials dare not speak about above a whis
per, are proclaimed aloud by the foreign
newspapers so that the whole world
hears, and not only our affairs but those
of Japan. Europe and all countries, the
alliances, .ruptures, designs, battles, plots
are published so that one can see all
sides of a question and be on his guard."

Â°The.Flower*bf th'c Flock..
In "The Flower of th<j Flock," Mr. Nor
ris gives' evidence .of a careful study of
English^ and j American character and
shows very clearly the widely different
ideas dominant in English and American
families. - * - â¢
The characters are all fine tj^ics and
one of the best things to be said about
the book is that it Is pure. It will no
doubt be received with the favor that it
merits.
In the opening chapter one meets most
of the prominent people In the story at an
English tea. The characters are such
strong, personalties that the reader bo
comes deeply Interested from the firht.
The tea is given to introduce Mrs. Van
ReeB to London society. She is a young
widow from New York, who goes to Lon
don with the intention of enjoying her
self. Her riches,' charm of manner and Â¦
ready American wit make her at once a
social success.
Mrs. Van Rees meets Captain Charles;.
Strode, a nephew of her host, Lord S
Carshalton, at the tea, and becomes in
terested in. him. This young captain of Â¦
the Thirtieth Lancers is the absorbing
character study of the book.
It is the old s"tory of a man who r ls
ruined by the adoration of his family.
Everything the, captain does is right and
every excuse is made for him. He is leit
to his sports, while his father and younger
brother work hard amassing a fortune for
the spendthrift. He realizes his Rhort
comings. but is too weak to correct them/
He has never been accused of a fault till
he meets Mrs. Van Rees, with whom he
falls violently in love. She bees him aj
he is and takes him to task for his ac
tions. She sees that he has encouraged
false hopes in the- breast of a penniless
cousin who lives with his mother, and 6he
points out to him his duty. She has a
wonderful influence over him and when
the business panic comes and Strode ana
son lose heavily, she brings him to a
full realization of his unworthiness, and
he seeks a commission which lakes him
to Africa. ""*.;<*
, The captain feels the hopelessness of his
love for Mrs. Van Rees and hates the
Idea of marriage with his cousin, who
considers herself engaged to him and re
fuses brilliant offers.
Mrs. Van Rees extends her visit " in
order to comfort the wretched family, for
she fjels responsible for the departure
of the "Flower of the Flock." It is very
amusing to see Lady Caroline Strode tak
ing Mrs. Van Rees to her heart after tho
loss of the fortune, when the reader re
calls her horror of the possibility of a
marriage with Charles 'before the ca
tastrophe. Mrs. Van , Rees understands
perfectly, but notwithstanding : Is quite
fond of Lady Caroline and takes her and
the cousin Lucy Bramston to New York,
where she entertains them .- In : splendid'
fashion. Lucy's heart though is In Africa
and she refuse* to be interested in the
men her hostess surrounds her with.
In the course of time the flower 6f the
flock returns to England to recover from
the effects of a fever and Mrs. Van Recs
Invites him to'AmVlca to escort the la-.
new markets for American goods."
The author is in favor of an Anglo-
Saxon alliance; which, he says, means
"the consciousness in ourselves' and _ the
declaration to. others that our national
sympathies are' everywhere on the side, of
Justice," freedom and. education; the nat
ural self-consciousness that In this respect
our spirit and"that of the people of Great
Britain are one; that the enemies of.jus
tice, freedom and education the world
over must hereafter reckon with America
and Great Britain as open; avowed and
courageous friends of these inalienable
rights of humanity." He let" furthermore
strongly in favor of expansion by war
where war is needed, and says: "It is time
to dismiss thecraven fear of being great,
to recognize the place in the world which
God has given us and to accept the re
sponsibilities which It devolves upon us
in behalf of Christian civilization." (Pub
lshed by the Baker & Taylor Company,
New. York. Price Jl.)
dies home. About this time a small for
tune* is left to Lucy, and the -younger
brother Sam (the real flower of the flock),
has little difficulty in persuading Charles
that he should marry Lucy. The hero
Sam has always loved her, but his love
and admiration for his brother is his first
thought." - i
However. It all works out very prettily
in -the end, and Sam Is not called upon
for greater sacrifices. Charles goes .to
New York, and Lucy, seeing that he -is
in love with the widow, turns the story by
giving him up; . ', â¢ .fV. Â¦>'; â¢
While the ending of the book^ may not
be entirely satisfactory to many reader-?,
still to the majority the hero, with all- his
faults, appears so fascinating .that one
cannot help falling under the spell. Of
the many charms of the story, one of the
most noticeable is the clever 'conversa
tion. The dialogue is uniformly good.

Kelea. fe Surf-Rider.
In "Kelea, the Surf Rider." Alexander
Stevenson Twombly gives us a vivid ro
mance of pagan Hawaii. Mr. Twombly
has resided in the Islands for eo long a
time that he Is perfectly familiar wltn
his Bubject and could not fail to write a
story of merit. He has cleverly inter
woven the folklore of the country with
history and then added a love story to
make the whole a very readable and quite
-Instructive novel. The book contains
many dramatic situations and exciting in
cidents in connection with the exploration
of volcanoes, shark-fighting, surf-riding,
catching wild birds and the native wars.
The motif of the story centers in the ri
valry of two native girls for favor In the
eyes of a young chieftain. One of these
young women i3 the noble but passionate
Kelea, and the other a maiden of the op
posite type, called Pu Aloha (The Flower
of Love). This latter character is rather
impossible for that petiod, but neverthe
less acceptable. The illustrations are no
small addition to the text, being halftone
reproductions of actual scenes In the Isl
ands. (Published by Fords, Howard &

Rival Boy Sportsman
Mr. Parker's previous books, "Six
Ycung Hunters" and "Grant Burton," at
tracted attention from their spirited
treatment of outdoor, life, wholesome tone
'and fine illustrations. In this story,
"Rival Eoy Sportsman," Grant Burton,
hero of the previous volume, returns to
school vastly Improved by his experiences.
Through his leadership another club of
enthusiastic young sportsmen is formed,
not hostile to the first, but In friendly
rivahy, In pursuance of which they en
gage In a sarics of contests. Including a
hunting match, a fishing match, a boat
race, etc. An excellent idea of amateur
sports 13 gfven in a way that could be
done only by one thoroughly conversant
with them. This third volume is a fit
ting climax both in subject matter and
illustrations. The sixty-two pen and inks,
full page in part, scattered through the
bcok make it a very attractive boys' book.

The Baby Scholar.
A book has been published on "Viola
Olerich. the Famous Baby Scholar," re
lating the facts concerning this extraor
dinary Iowa infant whose life of forty
two months haa caused a sensation. From
the biography of this healthy child it
does not appear that at any time her
mental growth hindered in any way her
normal physical development. And yet
before her third birthday Viola counted
among her accomplishments: Reading,
writing, drawing, a vocabulary of 2500
English words, a fair smattering of
French and German, a surprising knowl
edge of geometrical figures, of astronomi
cal terms, of botanical analysis, etc. A
number of photographs corroborate the
descriptions. The. author. Professor
Henry Olerich.^ late School Superintendent
in, Iowa, gives* a lucid explanation for his
child's accomplishments. He demon
strates how . ., the majority of children
trained In the same manner may be
brought up to the very same results.

The Dobleys.
Here js a book with lots of fun in it
written by a woman! It is a popular
superstition that the fair sex are deficient

falsity. Readers of the New York Suuday
Sun have enjoyed for many moons the
DobUy sketches, "which are now gathered
into book form. There are none who nave
read them once but will be glad to see
them placed in a less perishable form
than the columns of a newspaper. The
new and old will both unite in relishing

unconventional young couple view and en

Tho Little Dreamer's Adverjture
In "The Little Dreamer's Adventure"
Frank Samuel Child has continued in a
measure his interesting story of "The
House With Sixty Closets." The same
tnildren and the same closets that ligurel
in that fascinating Christmas story are
with us again in an equally droll and
charming New Year's tale. Instead of
"Table of Contents" we read "Order of
Fun," and a most wonderful succession
of fun it is. The children meet and agree
to make a calendar. They call a meeting
of the days, and Anna Domino sits* In tho
chair. It is a large meeting of peculiar
days, taking the whole range from New
Year's day to Christmas day. But tha
story contains much more than mere fun.
There runs a deeper meaning through it
all. appearing in many happy touches.

DOWN THE RAVINE ROADWHO is the most unfortunate girl
ln San Francisco?
It's not a difficult question to
answer. Misfortune is not
bounded by mere poverty. There are oth
er things that go to make life's burden
heavier to bear.
Imagine a girl, young and beautiful,
vrith a disposition so sunny that not even
poverty could cast a shadow on it She
went to her daily work at the candy fac
tory with a emile on her lips. She came
borne at n:g"htfall and the humblÂ» little
cottage of her parents rang with her mer
ry laurhtcr.
Of courre. she had a sweetheart. And
Borne day Â¦when his little pile of savings
grew she was going to flit away to a mod
est little home of her own. In the mean
time they made the most Â»>f the little
pleasures they could snatch at â a ride to
tie park or a jaunt across the bay on
tlielr "day off." She was as merry as a
cricket and as busy as the proverbial
She knew that Fhe was pretty, for her
little mirror flaunted the fact to her face
every time It caught her peeping. Her
sweetheart Â¦wasn't the only lad who was
attracted by those merry blue eycÂ« with
their Jet-black fringes. Hut her eyes were
rot her pole beauty. Her complexion wa>
Â£8 creamy and pink as a wild rose, and
her lips as scarlet as the holly. Long.
thick brown hair, flecked with a glint of
the gold, fell below her waist. Just twisted
ln a braid snd falling loose again.
Tlxen one day, not a month ago. this
winsome girl of teventeen met with the
â¢cdfient that Fhut out the gladness and
the sunshine from, her young lif<?. She

caught her by the hair and whirled her
round and round, dropping her bleeding
and unconscious to the â¢ floor, her scalp
v.ith tho gold^brown hair torn from her
head.
Is not this genuine misfortune? Laura
I^arribert. the girl across whose path this
awful shadow has fallen, will not have it
that she Is the most unfortunate girl ln
San Francisco.
"1 am the most fortunate and the most
unfortunate girl in the city." she says.
Which is the unsophistociited. girlish
prose of the poet's kinship of Joy and
sorrow. Laura Lambert can appreciate
joy by contrast to her sorrows. From
the busy, sunshiny world they carried her
into the narrow confines of the sick room.
Her beauty is despoiled for a time at
least. Her glorious hair is gone for good.
She can neither walk nor lie down, but
for three months more must sit ln an
upright position.
Yet Fhe says she is es fortunate as she
is unfortunate. "I was lucky to escape
<ieath." she says. At seventeen life is
very sweet and she accepts her bruised
young life gratefully.
Of a truth. Laura Lambert has a great
many things to be thankful for.
Dr. Winslow Anderson of St. Winifred's
Hospital positively promises her a new
scalp. It may never put forth a growth
of hair, but it -will be a good, whole :;calp
whose baldness a wig will rasily cover.
I^aura Lambert has the buoyancy of youth
and will become reconciled to this loss
of her hair.
She can stand the sharp pains that rack
her poor, tortured head, for she has
found the richest of blessings â tried and
true friends. They come to see her every

Francisco Should Be Thankful.
flay, thev br'ng her fruits and flowers and
books to reÂ«d They tell her of the latest
play they have seen or of some funny
incident in their dally routine. They # try
to arrange it si/that s"ome one will always
be with her to keep her thoughts in happy
STooves. .
But it is by a severer test than these at
tentions that Laura Lambert has probed
through inenci! h.p's outer coatlnir. ln the
new scalp which sc.ente a giving : her
there are 'required Â£x,J p.eces of live hu
man skin, ranging In size from ha if of a
' pÂ»:a to a haif inch. The skin must come
irom ycur.g. healthy girls in order to in
sure a healthy scalp.
Now. how main- ciris are there who
could tinti enough friends who were will
ing to "sacr.nLt ti.eir skin." Yet every
one of the i'wo pieces and more too have
been ohereu to Laura Â¦ Lambert. Â¦
'Ihe gins in the candy stole where she*
workni all offered to make the sacrifice,
lt'fe not pleasant having a yiece ot your
skin cut <.fT. even thougn it be. from a part
of the body where the scars will never
show. But tne "candy" gins i.d not tn.iiK
of that. They wore < ageriy willing to suf
fer any ttxnpoiary pain that would bring
back health and sunshine to Laura Lam
bert.
Over a thousand pieces of skin have al
readv been grafted on her head, and in
another three months the untlie new scalp
will have been entirely grafted. But tnÂ«Â« ;
.scalp was lifted clear to the eyebrows and
these also must be supplied. Her nweei
heart offered his, tut Dr. Anderson pre
fers to get eyebrows from girls if possi
ble. It isn't necessary for any one girl
to sacrifice her eyebrows. Tiny graftings
from various ones will be used.- If the
hair should grow out In different colors
it can easily be stained one hue.
Surely iiPie ave eocd reasons why Laura
Lambert fhould be thankful, even in this
the hour of her misfortune..
But there is y*Â»t another cause for little
thrills of happiness putting the palntul
tortures to rout. . . â¢
Her sweetheart is as steadfast in his
devotion as In the days when she was the
prettiest wlrl in the candy store. Even
â¢ before he knew that science could so skill
fully cover up the scars of her accident,
ho stoutly affirmed his loyalty .and de
'clared he loved her for her good Heart and
not her good looks. But his lbve will
not be put to such ji severe test as he
imagined at first. Laura Lambert, except
ifor baldness, will probably not be In the
j least disfigured.
And so this brave young girl, who for
/three months sitting bolt upright- must
I daily endure operations. Is slowly regain
"lng the light-hearted cheerfulness that
once was hers. "Because." says Laura
-Lambert, "though I'm unfortunate. I
.have bo much to be thankful for."
What the Most Fortunate Girl of Pur
City Has to Be Grateful For.
WHO is the most' fortunate girl in ,
San Francisco?
It's not an easy question to an
swer, for happiness is an elusive
quantity that cannot be reckoned by any
standardâ not even that of dollars and
cents. It has delicate shades and grades,
that defy rule and line.
But by all the lore of sace and rynic
Elizabeth Huntlr.gton takes front rank in
the Hit of fortunate maiden*. Jf s-he Is
not the mest fortunate gill in SÂ«;n Fran
cisco, she is unquestionably one of the
n*.ost blessed.

they have their reasons for placing Eliza
beth Huntlnktcn as the most toriu. ate.
True, the asters have equal woa th. 'out â
and here's the but â they don't care for the
pleasures it buys, and Elizabeth does. So
tlure you have their reasons in a nut
shell. For what's the good, they argue,
of Clara and Marian Huntlngion's mil
lions when tbey don't care for the luxu
ries of great wealth.
Happiness, says the philosopher. Is the
ability to do without that for which your
heart (raves. The nst of the wor'd spells
happiness d.fferentlyâ it :s the ablity to
satisfy your dearest wishes, say tbe
worldiyiti's. Certainly there Is not a
worldly wish within the boundaries of
posslbl lty that Elizabeth Huntinston can
not gratify.
If her : father's wealth were dividpd.
share and share alike, on the famiiy. Miss
Elizabeth would be heiress to a modest
sum, estimated on the sunny side of the
J6.0OO.C00 mark. Mary Crocker, now Mrs.
Harrison, has a fortune of about $3,900,000,
which was the high-water mark for local
heiresses. But when Collls P. Huntlngton
died and left the bulk of his solden
treasure to his nephew, the Huntington
girls came to the front as the wealthiest
heiresses in our midst.
Elizabeth Huntington has a great many v
things to be thankful for besides dia
monds and dividends.
She has youth and the enthusiasm that
does not forsake one when the shadowi
of life" grow long. .
She has full share of the gifts that fall
to human lot. She Is not a great beauty,
but has a charm of her own. Her figure
Is slight, though not to angularity, and
her face has the length which denotes
keenness; it Is long from brow to chin,
with none of the attributes of a scold.
.Her eyes say. "I can feel," and her mouth
says. "I can be firm."
She has the tare faculty of making gen
uine friends â those who love her for her
true-gra.ned human worth. She has the
rarer faculty of knowing how to hold
them. Her friends are not numerous, but
they are worth the making and the keep-
Ing. "To have a few friends, and these
wunout capitulation," might well be her
motto.
Of course she has dozens and dozens of
pleasant acquaintances aw well as these
soui-to-soul friends. She is fond of so
ciety ami Its primrose pleasures â the
grand bails, the formal dinners and re
ceptions, the gay cotillons, the delightful
luncheons and teas. She likes it allâ the
mao. merry whirl tha; sweeps the favored
tew alone its flower-scented paths, scarce
ly giving them time to get a whiff of any
ere particular exotic.
She is fend cf entertaining, unlille her
sisters, but as .yet has not had an
opportunity to show her San Francisco
friends whit a charming and lavish host
Â»s=s she can fce. Since her debut one thing
or another bus interfered with her enter
taining as she would like to and as her
beautiful homo permits. Owing to the re
cent death of her uncle it will probably be
some months before youth and pleasure
can hold high carnival In the Huntington
household.
There is not a honeyed pleasure of life
that she canrot afford to taste and she
chooses. Aladdin's Lamp and the Wish
ing Ring would be of little use to her. The
"dulces" of life are already at her beck
and call.
She likes beautiful things to wear and
has exquisite gowns, hats end all the
other fluffs and frills that po to make my
ladv's wardrobe. When she sees soine
thins that takes her fancy she does not
have to ask that irritating "how much?"
When a girl has a comfy little fortune of
Â«lx million and over she can afford to be
extravagant. But she is always dressed
in perfect taste, having that inborn sense
of the. niceties and proprieties of dress
that can neither be acquired nor thrust
upon one.
She is fond of music and has heard ali
the operas from Bayreuth to Coveat Gar
den, from the Metropolitan to the Granl
Opera-house. She herself is a musician
of no mean ability.
She has traveled far and wide and seen,
many of the wonders of the world. She is
a fluent linguist and can thus break down
the barriers that divide foreigners and get
close to thpir manner of thought ant! life.
She â¢Â» in nowise a nomad, ever restlessly
on the wing. It is not that she lovei
travel less, but that she loves home morÂ»-.
She has a warm, ready sympathy for
these los? fortunate than herself, an^!,
moreover, the wherewithal to allevtai*
suffering. She has brought sunshine Into
many a desolate life, but in an unosten
tatious manmr that screened it from tha
praise of the public. Thank??ivlng will be
something mure than a hollow name to
many a poor soul, thanks to her gen
erosity.
Surely here Is a girl whoÂ«e eoblet of
good fortune is full to overflowing. But
there are other things which the Princecj
Fortunatus is thankful for. The Hunting
ton household is an exceptionally happy
one. Discords never creep throush tha
cracks and quarrels must roost elsewhere
The tastes of the three Huntington sisters
are not ju.st alike, but they harmonize and
go to make an Ideal heme. Marian, tha
youngest daughter, who had not yet maila
her debut, is more like her oldest slater.
Clara, than is Elizabeth. Clara has trieJ
society and found it wanting, and Marian
has already made up her mind that it
will not be satisfying.
But merry, happy, care free Elizabeth,
likes everything that ia good, and can find
th^ good that Kirk? in everything.
But finest trait of all. Elizabeth Hunt
ington Is a girl who could meet fortune's
frowns as well as her smiles. Perhaps of
all the good things she ha3 to be thankful
for. this is the best.

game that ought to piove to the sourest

plucky Murphy lay helpless on the

jT IC these davs Thanksgiving wouldn't
b* Thanksgiving without the inter

ball wouldn't be football without
the co-eds.
""They're about as necessary .to the
Came as a meringue is to a dinner," say
the scoffers. Tut, tut! little beys <for
these discontents are always "Freshies").
The upper classmen, graduates, and foot
ball enthusiasts know that the feminine
element gives something more than color
to the scene.
The co-eds haven't the double-barreled
lung power to augment the moter?, but
their very presence is an Inspiration to
the players to do their football best. It'.-Â»
the desire to please some co-ed that has
sent many a ball over 'he goal. ,
There may be girls who think football
"unladylike" and ignore it. But they're
not college girls. The co-ed is as enthu
siastic over the game as her football
hanged brother. For weeks before the
big game the college girls worry more
over the outcome of the game than they
do over a thesis, or the new gown they're
going to don for THE occasion.
They attend the practice games, take
lotrs of the caliber of the various teams,
and discuss the ultimate success of their
college, with all the concentrated inter-
Tha sororities or" girls' "frats" usually
go in a body. In Berkeley there Is fre
quently a luncheon at the "frat" houses
and then the girls come over. to the city
in plenty of time to get their seats on the
bleachers, and add to the preliminary
thrills that precede the game. . ;
On Thanksgiving day the co-ed goes to
the game in twos, quartets, or with hor
frat sisters. Not many of them, go with
their college brothers, for on that day of
days the men prefer to be unhampered
by a restraining feminine Influence. They
want to sit with the rooters; they want
to jump the side lines when me game is
over and help carry their triumphant or
defeated team: they want to drown their
sorrow or express their Joy ln the brim
ming cup. And if they take a girl tj
the game they can't very well do the~u
things. . . . ' v
The college girls don't mind this deser
tion a bit. They can sympathize with th2
Â¦men because they'd like to do some, of
these things themselves. So they cheer

brothers. ' Â¦ -
Co-ed nature is very much the same
thia college around. Stanford
has all the brands of * co-eds that
ijo to give a feminine tang to college lite'.
The Sianford co-ed, third person, plura:
â¢number, is perhaps a bit more intricately
acquainted with the rules and regulations
of football than her equally enthusiastic
Berkeley sister. The Stanford firtrls <tll
Â»live within sound of the practice games,
while many Berkeley co-eds have to run
to catch a boat instead of watching the
daily practice. , Â¦ .
"I guess not," laughco the co-ed. "Th-j

"and my record, bar that, is clear, aiifl

woidd take me now as I am; but 1 have
the world.' This feminine appreciation of
man's. natural bondage and his worship
of the petticoat had come, to her by In
stinct, and had given to- her intercourse
with Ned Glover, what the Americans call
snap": which has a parallel in the cool,
inspiriting lake breeze, that Is a welcome
temporizer of the Chicago summer.
On this last day of Ned's sojourn at
ParkEide,..however, Zella found it almost
Impossible to maintain a fair semblance
of her characteristic sangfrojd. She was
heartily grieved to lose the pleasant com
panionship of the young Englishman; and
he found himself in' the complimentary
position of console*.
"I could not Jiave believed anything
couln make me feel so wretched," she
confessed. "I wish you were not going,
dear."
"Then, I won't go," he said, "I won't
go." ' i
..A'P ut you are Pledged," she answered.
Of course, you have to go; and I must
brace up and cheer you."
"It is only to be a preface to the story
of our happiness.". he said. "In this life
one gets nothing worth having without
sacri Â« c es for it. It will seem
centuries ere I see you agui:;, thou&h it
woman now. Ye'll find her in my par
lor; and. If ivver there was an angel on
airth, it's Zella Brunnen."
"Dr. Johnson said that a good woman
is Nature's understudy for an angel. Mrs.
O'Hagan; and I think I know two under
studies, the one who will twang the harp
of Erin round the throne, and the
other â " ââ¢Â¦Â¦*
"Now, ye're tryin' to laugh at us," she
said, interrupting him, "but I see the
tears in yer eyes, and a man's tears is
peaTls av price; but they break me heart,
Good-by. sorr! Saint Mary be yer guide;

reliance!" . â¢ <Â¦Â¦*Â¦-Â¦
She kissed both his hands and turned
away. He huried downstairs to the litlta
parlor. Mrs.' O'Hagan t?i>* into the
farthest corner of her own- chamber to
weep and to pray for han, with a strange,,
weird conviction tYÂ»* she would never see
him again.
On the other. hand. Zella was of an
optimistic disposition, full of hope and
bravery. Touched keenly at parting with
her lover, she never doubted for one mo
ment fhat it was but the prelude to a
vÂ«>jy happy reunion. Almost in spite oC.
3.t.i5.:iL sfce, Jtid come to love J\cti .witn
sworn to myself* not to run the risk of
giving her a penniless husband."
"That's all right. Ned. I'm glad we me*.
I am just off to New York, and probably
sail next week for England; an Interesting
case, with ramifications East, West anu
in London. However little you may think
of my warnings, you will not forget them.
Old Dexter liked you awfully, as you
would say, 'awfully, deal boy,' until you
liked Zella Brunnen just as awfully; and
when you went to live at.Parltslde he just
hated you awfully, dear fellow. Well,
good-by. good luck!" â¢ Â¦
"The same to you.' dear friend. Don't
thii.k me ungrateful."
"Th*-re is nothing so ungrateful as the
egotism ot a young man in love, but that
is not a charge I make against you. If
Miss Brunnen need* a friend in your ab
sence, she can count on Joe Williams,
chief of the secret service of Chicago."
"Who Is leaving America," said Glover,
with a sigh.
"Only for the space of eight-and-twenty
days."
"One word more. Joe." said Ned. taking
out a notebook and writing hurriedly the
address of Richard Lorrimer (Straker,
LÂ«ve & Ixirrimer), Bedford row, W. C,

' "I must say 'Good-by* to the women
and the others," said Ned. looking round.
&s if they were by his side. "And that's
Old Glencoe's voice I hear. Once more,
dear; God bless you! Good-by!"
Having embraced her for the last time
he' sped to the door, opened it and let in
the company.*
"Mr. Glbver." .said Glencoe. "on behalf
of Mistress O'Hagan's paying guests I
ask- you to put this wee souvenir In your
pocket; and we wish you godspeed, mon,
and all prosperity!"
He thrust into Ned f 3 hand a heavy cigar
case, mounted in silver and engraved with
his name and the date, and also with the
dear old Scotch formula, "For Auld Lang
Syne!"
"I: thank you. Mr. Glencoe. and your
friends and mine, for your most kind and.
I - fear, ill-deserved token of your good
will. I. shall prize It dearly."
"Cude-by, Mr. Glover," said Mrs. Fer
guson, putting out her hand, "and a hap
py return!"
"Which is my own wish; and so say we
all." sa'a the bartender's widow.
The Henator from Kentucky gave his
hand, with a patronizing but friendly air;
and now the cook thrust her way to the
front, with. her blessing and a bird pie
that he was to enjoy on the cars. The
waitress shook his hand warmly, and Mrs.
O'Hagan claimed the last- touch of him.
Then there was a crack of the express
man's whip, followed â¢ by a malediction
from Mrs. O'Hajrnn â "Divle take ye. for
a 'baggage-smashing spalpane! Ye've
knocked the hasp aff the box." With the
"Hoo-rooh!" of Mickey from the stables
hard by, and the barking of his dog. the
daring retort of the expressman. "Ye'd
be a hard hasp to break. Mistress O'Ha
gan!" the wagon rattled over the uneven
roadway, followed on the sidewalk by Ned
Glover, who was glad when he" came to
the turning that took him to the car
track, where he paused a moment to wave
a handkerchief in response to the last
kindly , tokens of farewell exhibited on
the stoop of thÂ° Parkside boarding house.
"A little more of it," he said to him-
that closed so easily, were open, with an
appealing smileâ a sunbeam througn
showers. Her upturned face was the face
of a Miranda, rather than that of a Diana.
Her light brown hair was pushed in a
wavy mass from her forehead, witn lit
tle, clinging, down-like curls about her
temples and neck. One hand lay in his
lap, limp and passive, and the entire fig
ure suggested a sad resignation.
"Dearest," he said presently, "I never
felt until now that I have In truth won
you, that you are mitre with all your
heart; and shall I hesitate, at this mo
ment of my great happiness, to make the
sacrifice It demands from an honest man?
Shall I throw up the opportunity to make
you a home and endow It worthily? To
give you the chance of travel, that you
have so much' desired; and, let me add,
selfishly, to give myself the bliss of be
ing- your traveling companion to Europe,
to show you London, to be your guide,
philosopher, friend and husband in the Old
World, to take you to my one dear
friend, Dick Lorrimer, and say, 'This,
Dick, is my wife, the sweetest, the best,
the dearest woman in all the world?' "
"My dear Ned," she said, turning aside
to wipe the tears from her eyes, "the
wagon is at the door."
An express van had pulled up, and the
driver was cracking his whip to call at
tention to his presence.
"I must look in at the Mall office before
I go to the depot. The wagon will bring
my traps; I will take the cars."
"You have said 'Good-by' to Mr. Dex
ter?"
"Yes. How ill he looks, how changed!
I wonder if he is drinking too much? The
old. chap was quite upset; begged me to
send him a wire when I get to the Val'.ey.
There's no wire nearer than the Red
Horse Forks; but the first telegram I
send will be to you, my love."
"I wish I might go with you to the de
pot; but I suppose I should be too sad
coming home alone."
"Sweetheart !'j said Ned, once more em
bracing her. "I could not bear to leave
you there. We will say 'au revoir' here,
in this dear little familiar room, where we
have spent so many happy hours; and I
shall always see you on this spot as you
are now. One day we shall smile to think
how much we made of so brief a parting.
When 1 return it will seem as if I had
only been away a day."
"Until you do ages will have passed."
she replied, with a sigh.
The closing scene of parting was broken
in upon by the prosaic, tramp of the ex
pressman on the stairs, bundling baggage
into the hallway; the angry voice of airs.
O'Hagan, demanding if he whs "going to
carry oft* her shtairway wid him?" the as
sisting clamors of the waitress, the
kitchen maid and the cook bringing up the
rear with wraps, a portmanteau and a
miscellaneous bundle of sticks and tools
and a shctgun.
strange to say. the very day Glover left
Chicago he "quite bucked up." as_ ham,
his colored servant, remarked. "Neboer
seen de Massa make slch effort, all In a.
minute; no. sah. for more'n thirty days
he go down and down, melanchoy as a
nlggah wid de mumps, and people finka
he's goln ter die for shure; den. as if
resurrection day hab come, he jus' bucks
up. like as If 'twas his weddin' day sure
â¢nuft!" â¢ â¢ â¢ Zella could not help com
plimenting Dexter on his improved ap
pearance. In return he gave her a grand
bow and said he" believed he was growing
younger. He took her hand, which she
held out to him.- and â a strange thins for
him* to do â he kissed It. It was strange.
too. that she should shiver as hia lips
touched her fingers, for. after all, thero
was nothing very startling in such an act
of gallantry.
Then Mr. Dexter dictated a letter to his
"sweet cousin" at San f'rancisco; and
again did a very unusual thing. In sitting
near Zella. while she took her shorthaml
rote! more#than once he laid a special
emphasis on passages that seemed to ap
ply to herself. She could not convlr.ee
herself whether her formal engagement
to Ned had made her hypersensitive, or
whether Dexter was contemplating some
p'ot against her.
"If I had full authority over you I
should compel you to accept the offer of
Mr. Leicester Miller. What has age to
do with such a business? You are young,
beautiful, accomplished, poor and unpro
tected: he is In the prime of life, not more
than 60, companionable, loves you and ia
â¢worth ten million dollars at least, can
give you every luxury; whereas, the
younsr man you think you care for. and
who has pestered you with his attentions,
is penniless, an alien, I believe, and, what
Is worse, a man of no moral character.
It grieves me to have to mention so deli
cate a matter . . ."
"Mr. Dexter." said Zella. "don't you
think you really ought to write a private
letter of this kind yourself? It really
embarrasses me very much. I Â¦would
rather not be the medium of such letters."
"But. my dear child, a shorthand writer
Is not supposed to think about what she
Is taking down, and It Is her duty to dis
miss all remembrance of It the moment
she has transcribed It. But I wouldn't
embarrass you for the Â¦world, dear child.
I 'will not trouble you further with the
worries I have to endure for that wrong
headed, pretty, unhappy cousin of mine;
confound her!"
"Thank you. sir," said Zella, more for
mal than usual in the way In which she
addressed him.
"I wish I could do something for you
that would be worth the thanking. Miss
Zella. Oh! If you only knew how I Ions
to do something for. you!"
"Mr. Dexter!" ' .
"Something, you know, that might show
you how much Iâ erâ feel for youâ^râ the
daughter of a great American soldier.
"Mr. Dexter!"
"I know you. think I am taking a lib
erty. . . I have !;nown you nigh upon
two years. . . Mr. Glover only sees you
once or twice, and he dares to make love
to you. . . Such is woman!"
"Mr. Dexter, what Is the matter with,
you to-day?"
"Nay, my dear; what Is the matter with
you? .... Your lover has left you.
. . . Your dear friend. Hiraigi Dexter,
only wishes to lighten the darkness â just
a gleam or so â and you are angry?"
"I am not angry, but surprised. . . .
Ah! I know what It is; you have been
breakfasting at the Grand Pacificâ wi^h
Mr. Storey, perhaps?"
"And taken a glass of wine too much,
eh? Oh, you cynic! . . . Well, put It
down at that and forgive me, Mls3 Prude.
. . . I am a good deal of a fool, some
times, and caring for you as I do â and for
Glover, too; God bless the fellow! â I feel
good; want to do something generous, eh?
I only wish Glover was worthy
of you, my child. . . . But that
would be Impossible. No man that lives
is worthy of you. Nor no man dead ever
was!" â¢-.-.. 'r Â¦â¢Â¦
Dexter warmed to his theme, and
warmed to Zella, too, as he rambled on.
Perhaps he took the cue of having had
too much wine as an excuse for the ex
uberance of his remarks. It was a very
hot -day. The blinds were drawn and tha
atmosphere seemed to Invite confidences.
"My dear Mr. Dexter, let us get to tha
business of the day."
"Well, 'this Is It. "Will you do me th*
honor of taking a seat In my box at tho
opera to-night?"
"I didn't know that you went to tha
opera." â¢
"This Is the Italian opera, from New
Tork and London: very swell and "
"I am not very swell, Mr. Dexter, and
besides " â¢
"You'd have gone with Glover."
"Thafs a different thing altogether."
HÂ« saw that he w.-vs treading on dan
gerous ground: saw it in her eyes. More
over, she rope from her seat as If aha

PARIS, Nov. 24.â The city of Park
welcomed Mr. Kruger to-day in a
whole-hearted manner, according
him a sincere reception at the
station, and showing by the
cheering of the crowds all along the route
that he was cordially welcome and had
the sympathy of the populace. The thor
oughfares through which Mr. Kruger
passed were not lavishly decorated, but a
few Vtags were flying and the hotel was
nicely decorated, while from early morn
ing the street hawkers did not permit the
pedestrians to forget that it was Kruger
day. All sorts of Insignia were offered for
sale. Small Boer flags, badges of the Boer
colors and scarf pins of the same charac
ter were called out on the boulevards, and
lucky were the salesmen, for almost every
person wore a Boer emblem.
By 10 o'clock the sidewalks began to fill,
Â¦while In the vicinity of the railway sta
tion and about the Hotel Scribe the
crowds constantly Increased in size.
Small squads of guards, on foot and
mounted, were continuously passing, evi
dence of the fact that the Government
was taking stringent precautions to pre
vent trouble. On the Place de la Bastlle
a few national groups collected, but they
were eoon dispersed.
By the time the train was due to arrive
all the places of vantage about the rail
road station and hotel were packed for a
distance of about a block. Among those
gathered at the railro/Ld station were
Count Boni de Castellane and several
other well-known Nationalist Deputies
and Miss Maud Gonne and a party of the
Irish delegation. â¢
The crowd on the platform pressed so
closely about Mr. Kruger's salon car that
for a time he was unable to alight and
stood on the footboard bareheaded, ac
knowledging the plaudits of his admirers.
M. Crozier, chief of the Protocole of the
department of the Foreign Office, to which
Is intrusted questions of etiquette and the
reception of diplomats and others, ad
vanced and bade Mr. Kruger welcome In
the name of President . Loubet and the
French Government. Mr. Kruger bowed
his thanks. ;
Mayor Grebauval then greeted Mr. Kru
ger in behalf of the municipality of Faxls,
and the president of the pro-Boer" Society
and others presented the aged traveler with
addresses of welcome, to which' M*r. Kru
ger replied that he was extremely "happy
to again find he was touched to the bot
tom of his heart by the welcome he-had
received and could not find words to ex
press his appreciation of 'the sympathy
Frenchmen were displaying toward his
country. He concluded; with sayin*,he
had faith in the Boer : nation, which,'
though tempest tossed, would keep afloat
and never sink.

M. Crozier, Chief of the Protocl. called
at 2:15 p. m., and Mr. Kruger. who was
sleeping, arose to receive him. M. Crozier
announced that President Loubet was
prepared to receive Mr. Kruger at 4
o'clcck and the tired traveler prepared
himself to visit the Elysee. While the
crowd before the hotel decreased some
what, a considerable concourse remained
shouting Mr. : Kruger's name.
"Mr. Kruger at his hotel received in suc
cession a number of delegation?, including
one from the Nationalist Deputies, headed
by MM. Millervct and Lases. He after
ward received the Prefect of Police. M.
Leplne, and M. Lebolse Marqulel, a
brother of the famous colonel, who was
killed In South Africa while fighting for
the Boers. Mr. Kruger then retired to
his room, declared he was fatigued and
would see nobedy.
Along the route flowers were thrown
into Mr. Kruger's landau and women
tossed their handkerchiefs in his direc
tion. Mr. Kruarer smiled and reganl^d
with curiosity the balconies and roofs,
which were alive with people. On his ar

greeted on the threshold , with the Btfer

so omnipresent were the police that many
persons desiring to give utterance to anti-
British sentiments would hardly have
dared to do so. There was but one Inci
dent" having any resemblance of thia
sort. Opposite the hotel is an English
store and on Its balcony stood many spec
tators. '. When Kruger appeared on the
balcony of .the hotel some one In the
crowd noticed that the men on the store
balcony wore their hats. Immediately a
cry of "hats off' was directed at thenr,
and the men on the balcony, appreciating
the s'tuation. uncovered and the crowd
heaved a great "ah" aa some one cried,
tauntingly, "Do you speak English?" in
very broken Kngli?h, arid the affair was
ended. â¢
:, Through, all this fervid ..welcome the
anti-British i, sentiment did not" appear.'
The cries were, confined to plaudits. of Mr.
Kruger and the Boers. If there were any.
shouts opposed to Great Britain they were
not heard 'in /the general 'tumult.- So di

of-' Police, M. Lcpine, to cause the arrest
of persons raising anti-British shouts and

crowd .to the utmost was the appearance

of Mr. Kruger, waving a Boer flag. iThe
little ones ' were cheered to the echo as.

Boer, colors/* " :
Mr. Kruger, bareheaded, bowed on all
sides, while the air was rent with cries of
"Vive Kruger," "Vive les Boers." Mr.
Kruger quickly alighted from his carriage
and entered the hotel, but the mass of
spectators wasTifbt satisfied and the peo
ple shouted, rolled and clapped their
hands in chorus until a window on the
balcony \vra* opened and Mr. Kruger ap
peared. Then' hats : were again thrown In
the air and the shouting was resumed
with vigor. Handkerchiefs and flags were

daunted, 'the' students broke into cries and
songs until Mr. Kruger. again appeared in
response to * their ;.; demonstration.' after
which -he, retired" for' lucheon.
Many Cries of Welcome.
A large escort of mounted municipal
guards rode around Mr. Kruger's car
riage. Along the main boulevards the
crowds increased in size, and as Mr.
Kruger reached the central portion of the
city the Pidewalks were blocked, and
every window was filled with sightseers;
trees had been climbed and boxes, chairs
and ladders were brought into use to per
mit a glimpse of the noted stranger.
Within two blocks of the hotel the streets
were so crowded that progress was im
peded. The police precautions were very
stringent. The streets for .half a block
from the hotel were cordoned by rows of
mounted republican guards, augmented
by files of armed municipal guards. Over
the entire route from the station to the
hotel enthusiastic cries greeted Mr. Kru
ger. Shout after shout arose until there
was a continuous roar of cheering. When
the Boer president entered the cleared
area in front of the hotel the demonstra

Mr.' Kruger, to the great disappoint

front of the station, where a four-horse
landau was drawn up. Mr. Kruger en

oft for his hotel, amid enthusiastic cheer-
Ing, which followed him along the whole
routeâ along the outer boulevarde aqross
the Place de la Republic", .which was a
perfect sea of spectators, and through the
central boulevards. He arrived at the

Beply of the Visitor.
Xearing Paris these gatherings grew
more frequent and of larger number,
until the train approached the terminus,
the Gare de Lyon, here. Then a remark
able spectacle was presented. Not only
the windows, but the roofs of the houses
commanding a view of the track, were
covered with spectators. In addition the
railroad employed, . engineers, cleaners,
porters and guards had clambered on the
trains lying on the side of the tracks
and at the coaling platformsâ at every
point where a glimpse only of the train
itself could be secured. This, however,
was merely a foretaste of the spectacle
which greeted Mr. Kruger's eyes when
the train steamed' into the station Itself.
Notwithstanding precautions . to admit
only ticket holders, a large assemblage
filled the station, while through the open'
doors could be seen a huge concourse of
people gathered in the courtyard outside.
The Mayor and municipal councillors, a
number of Senators, Deputies," army of
ficers and reporters were mustered on the
platform. Mr. Kruger was to Have passed
through the station, which had been spe
cially arranged as a salon of honor, being
profusely decorated with flowers v and
where he was to be formally received by
the Mayor and municipal councillors, but
for some reason the Mayor welcomed him
oh the platform* Instead. /
Elsewhere along the route there were
the same scenes as yesterday. People
were waiting on the sides of the track
and on bridges and other â¢ points of
vantage. They' waved their hands and
cheered as the train rushed past at high
est speed.
The train stopped only once en route,
at La Rcche. Here a deputation with
flags was waiting at the station to pre
sent Mr. Kruger with a warmly worded
address of admiration and sympathy for
the Boer causa. Mr. Kruger thanked the
deputation through his interpreter. The
crowd, which was of respectable numbei

spite of the early hour, a fair number of
inhabitants assembled on the platform to
cheer the departing statesman. Mr.
Kruger uttered a few words of thanks to
the city for its splendid welcome.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON* HO
; TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.-"There
; has been no change In the attitude' of
| Germany with respect to China. She is
> as strongly opposed to partition as is the
j United States." This statement was made
â¢ to the Call correspondent to-day by Baron
von Holleben, German Enabassador to
this country, who has Just arrived in
Washington from Berlin,
"The feeling in Germany." continued
the Embassador. "is one of decided
1 friendship for the United States and a
{ hearty sympathy with its aim to bring
j about the restoration of the status quo
in China- There is absolutely no ground
for supposing that Germany has any
ulterior purposes regarding China. The
policy of the Government is to-day what
it was on July 10. when Count von Bu
i low, then Minister of Foreign Affairs,
I made this declaration: 'Our aim is the
restoration of security for. persons and
property, freedom of action for German
subjects In China, rescue of foreigners
besieged in Peking, re-establishment of
security and normal conditions under
properly organized Chinese Government,
and reparation and satisfaction for out
rages committed. We desire no partition
of China, and peek no special advantages.*
"This was closed with the statement
that 'the Imperial Government is imbued
with the conviction that the maintenance
of the agreement between the powers is
a primary condition for the restoration
of peace and order in China." This note
is the framework of Germany's policy.
The Anglo-German agreement Is in pur
suance of the important principles there
in set forth, and is In accordance with
the principles which .the United States
has consistently advocated. As I have
stated. Germany is opposed to partition.
She desires the privilege of trade on equal
terms with other powers. The Anglo-
German agreement is a guarantee of the
observance of the two principles. In Ger
many the impression prevails that the
Anglo-German agreement has given en
tire satisfaction to the United States.
"I feel safe In saying that no power is
more anxious to bring about a termina
tion of the present unsatisfactory condi
tions- prevailing in China than is Ger
many. Favoring the maintenance of the
Integrity of China, It is to her interest, as
It is to that of every power having no sin
ister motive, to act with the other nations
to effect a prompt settlement. Germany's
course has been guided by a desire to pre
serve the concert of the nations, without
which there Is grave danger that the ob
jects sought cannot be accomplished."
As a result of the exchange of views to
be made by the powers, as suggested by
Secretary Hay in his latest note, it is
hoped that a satisfactory method of solv
ing the Chinese difficulty will be adopted.
It Is apparent that the President wishes
to supplement the work of the Ministers
in Peking by direct negotiations with the
powers. It Is not intended to withdraw
the matter at once from the Ministers,
but it is intended to expedite their action,
and falling in this, to seek some other
method to end the unsatisfactory situa
tion. As all the powers have assured this
Government of their wish to secure a so
lution that China can agree to, there only
remain details.
Although Japan gave her adherence to
the Anglo-German agreement, the author
ities here are sure that the Toklo Govern
ment does not favor the execution of
princes and mandarins, but is rather in
sympathy with the attitude of the United
States, Russia and France. If Japan can
be brought into line the balance will be
so strong against Great Britain and Ger
many that they will be forced to agree to
a more moderate plan. It was predicted
by a diplomat to-day that so long as the
negotiations remain In the hands of- the
Ministers a solution would be impossible.
The State Department understands that
Russia and France would like to use some
other methods of reaching an agreement,
but whether Great Britain and Germany
will do so is a question; the next few days
will answer. The United States has not
yet submitted a proposition for an inter
national conference to settle the Chinese
question, but it is admitted that it may be
necessary to do so as a last resort.

James B. Reynolds, who is at the head
of University Settlement, In ]>vington
Ftreet. said he believed that Bishop Pot
ter's reference to a vigilance committee
meant nothing more than appeared in the
exact words used "the vigilance commit
tee plan Is feasible- It has already been
tried in this city, though for different pur
poses. You will remember that the late
Colonel Waring when in charge of the
Street Cleaning Department had a vigi
lance committee formed, the members of
which inspected the conditions of streets
a.nd reported to him. There is this differ
ence: Then va had all confidence in the
chief of the department and little In his
subordinate*; now we have little . confi
dence in the Chief of the Police Depart
ment, while we have full confidence in a
majority of the members of the force."
It now seems to be the opinion of gen
tlemen who have made the closest study
of the problem that is to be solved that a
head committee will be formed, and that
later a vigilance committee will bÂ«
brought into existence. Such committee
was tugpested by the Bishop.
It is probable that the general plan out
lined by Bishop Potter on Friday will be
followed.
Although no mention is made of Tarn
dar.y in the call which was sent out Fri
day afternoon â after Bishop Potter had
delivered his address in St. Paul's chapel
en "God and the City**â it is freely con
fessed by thosÂ« responsible for the new
movement that Tammany Hall must be
counted as an enemy.
For the purpose of allying all of those
fcrces that are now operating for the sup
pression cf vice a call has been issued for
a conference to be held in the Chamber
cf Commerce next Tuesday afternoon.
Richard Croker's committee on vice has
?howa no mere activity than the police.
It has held several meetings, but *iÂ«Â« ac
complished nothing. The Tammany pur
ists evinced interest in a Brooklyn citizen,
who called on them to prevent the use of
profanity in the EtreÂ«ts, and they almost
reached a working point when a citizen
from Amsterdam avenue told them he
was sure there was vice in the city which
should be suppressed. But the committee
soon relapsed into Inactivity. As a re
sult cf their meetings the Tammany pur
ists have accomplished the only feat of
finding rooms to meet in.
Captair. Herlihy was transferred from
"command of the Eldridge-street precinct
a veek ago, but there has been little
charge la the "red-light" district since
Captain Titus took charge. The new com
manding officer made an impression on
many evil-doers In that section by mak-
Ir.g a raid en a disorderly house and ar
resting twelve women inmates. For a few
days this had a salutary effect, but the
improvement was short-lived. Xearly all
of the resorts of which complaint has
been made are being conducted almost
as openly as before.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24. -Although this is
the tenth day since Richard Croker an
rcnir.ced to Tammany's executive commit
tee that vice must be Euppre; 1 * ed in this
city, practically nothing toward suppres
pir^: :t has been accomplished by the
Tammany Police Board. Disorderly
houses, poolrooms and gambling resorts
remain open every night In all parts cf
thÂ« city, just as Teas the case when Tam
rnany became eo chocked that a commit
tee was named on vice to purify the city.

LONDON. Xov. 2*.â London's new
Ix>rd Mayor, Frank Green, takes
a very radical and friendly view
of the American invasion of thi
city's finance, trade. and transportation.
"It is merely a matter of utilitarian-
Ism," he paid to a correspondent. "Ameri
can capital is bound to improve business
here, and it is welcomed warmly as any
thing tending to bring the' two nations
the most good, even though it may appear
to result only to the advantage of one of
them. Together, England and America
are more powerful In every way than the
rest of the world.
"Regarding placing Government loans
In America, patriotism naturally compels
me to say English financiers should nave
the first chance; but if Americans give
better terms why let them have them, by
all means. All things being equal I zee
no reason why Americans should not be
allowed to subscribe to the loan which- is
likely to be asked for at thfc resumption
of Parliament and if by open competition
she ca.n secure the bulk I am sure no
hard feelings will exist in the city."

tation facilities when capital is going bee-

Would Offend England.
PARIS, Nov. 24.â Paris, while giving full
vent to her pent-up feelings of sympathy
with and admiration for the Boers in it?
reception to Mr. Kruger to-day, comport
ed herself with wisdom and prudence.
While a few Isolated Instances of anti-
British vociferations were unavoidable,
never once throughout the day was then;
any semblance of an organized dem
onstration against England to mar the re
ception. But especially Â¦ reassuring was
the character of the reception and It was
with feelings of relief that the authorities
went to bed after the gloomy forebodings
inspired by the unfortunate ' incidents
which had marked previous welcomes
given to Mr. Kruger en route to the
French capital.
It Is true that M. Ls Pine, Paris Pre
fect of Police, displayed his Irori hand In
a way that rendered even partial success
of any discordant outbreak impossible,
yet it Is but fair to emphasize the fact that
no disposition was ever evidenced to cre
ate trouble. The only difficulty experi
enced was in keeping the throngs from
sweeping over the line of the route In
their eagerness to secure a glimpse of the
figure of "Oom Paul." The most trouble
some task was met with In front of the
Gare.de Lyon when Mr. Kruger's landau,
drawn by horses decked Â¦ with rosettes of
the- Boer colors- and driven .-by, a coach
man wearing a similar favor In his but
tonhole, started. - â¢ .
Despite a formidable line* of police and
municipal guard3, aided by mounted Re
publican Guards, the crowd which w*s
massed at the approaches to the station,
numbering thousands, swept over the cor
don and In the twinkling of an eye M00
police and guards were mingled in inex
trlcabln confusion among the- multitude.
M. Mellne, who was preceding Mr. Kru
ger In a carriage, however, took the situ
ation in. at a glance and shouted to Mr.
Kruger's coachman to break Into a gal
lop, and, escorted by the mounted guards
and Â¦ a swarm of police on bicycles, he
dashed ahead Into the boulevard, where a
hedge of municipal guards kept tho
crowd In bounds.
GREAT BRITAIN'S OWN FATTT/T.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â Mr. Kruger's tri
umphant passage from Marseilles to Paris
is regarded' with curious and unexpected
indifference in Great Britain. .Every, de
tail of the remarkable ovation has been
read /with Interest, but the underlying
feeling here is more one of amusement
than irritation. The nation that boiled
over with fury when Queen Victoria was j
caricatured by Parisian Journals -takes |
the French homage to' its arch enemy by
an exhibition of Inevitable gaelic enthu
siasm, ;- not -likely ..to affect, international
issues or. create any more serious friction
than :alftpady. exists "among the populace
of the two . countries. r
. The recognition of Mr. Kruger as being
still President of the Transvaal by both
the -French Government and thÂ©' Queen
of 'Holland- calls forth from the West
minster Gazette the remark that this ap
parent unfriendliness Is due to Great
Britain's own fault in hot communicating
to the powers the annexation of the Soutn
African Â¦ republics. â¢ So : long ns this Is "not
done Mr. Kruger, j according to this Eng
lish ' authority, ; has a perfect right to be
treated aa a sovereign traveling incognito.
This . failure to notify the powers, the
same Â¦ paper declares, ; militates still - more
seriously against Great Britain, for until
this international formality: Is observed
no right exists to treat the inhabitants
of the Boer republic as rebels.

LONDON, Nov. 24.â Lord Woiaeley
Is again reported to be extremely
dissatisfied with the position
which ho holds as commander-ln
chief without any real authority,
and it is said that he will not wait for
Lord Roberts" return, but will retire next
week, in which event his duties as su
preme officer of the British army would
be carried on temporarily by Sir Evelyn
Wood, the adjutant general.
Wolseley, after his retirement, is going
to- raise a tremendous storm in army cir

for the blunders of the African campaign.
His friends say all the blame has been
laid on him and he will endure It no long

may make the exposure i through th-3
newspapers or from his seat In the House
of Lords.
The Liberal newspapers blamed the Sec

blame on the commandcr-ln-chlef. "The

General Lord Kitchener to a lieutenant
generalship elicits trom Charles Williams,
one of the leaders of the war critics, the
bitterest indictment oi that general ever
published In England. He declares that
General Kitchener meditates a reckless
and ruthless extermination of the Boers,
hoping to execute his atrocities amid si
lence like that of the tornb of the Mahdi.
He believes the British officers and men
will not endure this and that Kitchener
will stand revealed to the country an a
scourge Inexorable.
Mr. Williams apologizes to Satan for
mentioning him In the name breath with
Kitchener and maintains that the return
of several general otticers and the removal
of General Kelly-Kenny from Bloemfon
tein contirm the suspicion that they
"would have nothing to do with Kitcn
ener's dirty work."
It Is almost needless to say that this bit
ter attack by no means represents the
average opinion. What exercises Great
Britain more than the progress of the war
in South Africa and Mr. Kruger"s visit to
France is the illness of the Czar.
The possibility of an avowedly anti-
Brltlsh regt-ncy with aggressive proclivi
ties looms up so keenly that It is doubted
if the daily bulletins from Lividla are
awaited any more keenly in Russia than
in Great Britain.
The bitterness with which the London
Times attacks every move made by Wash
ington in Chinese matters seems to In
crease daily, and is all the more surpris
ing on account of the attitude of the Brit
ish Foreign Office. The principles laid
down In feecretary Hay's latest note were
given to a representative of the Associ
ated Press by a British official before the
reception of Mr. Hay's note as voicing the
opinion of the British Cabinet. Yet the
Times comes out to-day with a vigorous
protest against the idea, of Mr. Hay's
principles being considered. . Referring tp
the Cincinnati speech of Wu ling Fang,
the Chinese Minister to the United States,
after saying that his promising the United
States the better commercial chances
when peace was restored, would in some
cases be. resented as an injury, the paper
add?: .. â¢ ,
"Hut Wu Ting Fang seems to have
known his audience. All the comment an
influential American paper makes is that
Wu Ting Fang knows that Americans,
like all others, give their own interests
first. 1 .' ,â¢
The Times then compares this attitude
with that of LI Hung Chang on his trip
around the world, during which, it is as
serted, he acted on the conviction that
impecunlary self-interest was the sole
guiding princlploof the" peoples and gov
ernments "which- proved unsatisfactory
recipients' of the multitudinous promises
which he failed to redeem."
Secretary Hay is taken severely to task
for daring to differ from the demands as
now formulated.
: . From another source comes, another
striking Impartial confirmation of the
American views. H. J. Whigham, corre
spondent of the Morning Post in China,
cables from Shanghai as follows: .
"The Peking farce continues. When I
left all th6. Tegntlons were trusting Li
Hung Chan^. It was believed that the
court would return to Peking and any at
tempt on the part of the Empress to ar
rest Prince Tuan would be' absurd. Prince
Chang, who was Â¦ arrested, is simply
Prince Tuan's scapegoat. * It Is obvious,
therefore," that the court will not return
to Peking. It can only be attacked dur
ing: the winter through the Yangtse VaJ-
COUNTRY CLERK
DIES SUDDENLY
Demise of Leslie Brice to
Be Investigated by
the Authorities.
Leslie Brice. a clerk, a years of age.
from Ferndale. Humboldt County, died
suddenly in the Tosemite House. 1059 Mar
ket street, early last evening. The causa
of his death Is still a mystery, but It 13
supposed to have been produced by
ptomaine poisonins or cerebral conges
tion. The father of the deceased conducts
a livery stable In Ferndale.
Younj; Brice came to San Francisco
three days ago for the purpose Â©T wit
nessing a football game. With him were
his brother and several friends. Last
evening the party had dinner at a dairy
kitchen, and during the meal Brice com
plained of a numbness in his right hand.
When he arose from the table he became
extremely ill. His friends took him to
the Baldwin Annex and later removed
him to the Yosemlte House, where he had
taken apartments/ - â¢ .
Drs. Forest, Cook and Lalnt were called,
but within twenty minutes after the boy
had been, taken to his room he expired.
The case may be one of ptomaine poi
soning, but the physicians are of the opin
ion that cerebral hemorrhage was the di
rect cause of death. The young man may
have eaten something which caused a
sickness of the stomach and the exertion,
caused by his vomiting may have rup
tured onÂ© of the blood vessels of the brain.
The body was taken to the Morgue, where
an autopsy performed by Dr. Leland dis
closed the fact that death was probablr
due to cerebral oedema, or rush of blood
from the brain. An Inquest will be held.
The police have concluded that GI1
mondo Bartolomeo. the Italian who was
found dead Friday morning in, Von ITehr
place, was not robbed and have dropped
the case. A watch was found on the dead
man, and this fact, conslderlns that there
is no proof that he was possessed of any
money lust before hl3 death, dissipates
the robbery theory In the minds of tfcÂ©
detectives. They believe that the maa
died of the injuries received in falling
from the car and that he wandered into
the alley while delirious.

CRITICISM OF

His Chinese Policy of the
Last Pew Months Dis-
Kruger Enthusiasm Runs High in
Germanyâ Favorable ' Comment
on His Frenoh Reoeption.
BERLIN, Nov. 24.-The Reich
stag debates this week on the
Chinese Indemnity bill in
volved a mass of interesting
facts showing conclusively that Em
peror William's . personal China policy
of the last six months is either wholly
or partly disapproved by nearly the en
tire nation, as evidenced by the fact that
every party leader has thus expressed
himself, even the extreme conservatives,
but now the Reichstag, unless it is will
ing to precipitate the gravest kind, of con
flict, which It is not, must needs appro
priate the sum already expended. Another
even more noteworthy fact that the
Reichstag, for the first time since the
empire's creation, indulges In free and
unrestricted criticism of the Emperor's
words and acts, every party sharing
therein without once being interfered with
by the president of the house. This is
regarded by leading parliamentarians as
an important gain for Germany.
Further political development was that
it was remarkable that some of the most
severe criticism of his Majesty's unmeas
ured "troop speeches" came from con
servative speakers. The Relchsbott, which
is en extremely loyal, conservative paper,
once more referring to the "no quarter"
speech and apostrophizing the Emperor
henceforth to mind his words more, say-
Ing he must not forget "that every word
goes into the world and Is subject to the
world's criticism."
Baron Wangenheim's mysterious re
marks on Thursday about "unconstitu
tional Influences working upon the Em
peror, poisoning his mind and destroying
the nation's confidence In the monarch,
are now Interpreted by a number of papers
to mean that Ills Majesty lends his ear
to industrials, commercials and scientists,
which the National Zpltung consider? to
be the best way for his Majesty to learn
the sentiments of the different classes,
and not only those of the nobility and
Agrarian estate holders.
The Liberal press takes Baron von
Wangenheim to task on the subject.
From an authentic source the Associated
Press finds the Reichstag is composed of
the following party representatives: Cen
ter, 106; Socialists, 57; Conservatives. 51;
Nationalists, 51; FreissÂ»Innige Volks Partel
(Richterists), 27; Freisslnnige Vreigne, 13;
Relchspartei, 21; South German Volks
Partel, 7; anti-Semites, 15; Poles, 14, and
the rest scattering.
The Emperor's address yesterday to the
marine recruits almost exclusively re

the new motto, "Germans to the front,"
adding: "Sly sons there did not break
their oath of obedience swarn to me."
There is a great Kruger enthusiasm
here. The papers are commenting ap

SOME STARTLING FACTS
WINTER IS JUST BEFORE US,
Biting Winds, Cold
Drizzling Rain s,
Sloppy, Muddy
Streets and Sudden
Changes in the Tem-
perature.
The coming: winter will cause at least
one-half of the women to have catarrh,
colds, coughs, pneumonia or consumption.
Thousands 'of women will loÂ«o their lives,
and tens. of thousands will acquire some
chronic ailment, from which they will
never recover.
\ Unless you take the necessary. precau-
tions the chances are that you (who read
this) will be one of the unfortunate ones,
little or no risk need bo run If Peruna ls
kept In the house, and at the first ap-
pearance of any symptom taken as di-
rected on the bottle.'
, A cold is tha starting point of more
than half of the fatal illnesses from
November to May.
. A cold is the first chapter in the
history of every case of consumption.
A cold is tho first stagy of chronic
catarrh, the most loathsome and stub-
born of diseases.
A cold is the legitimate parent of a large
family of diseases, such as bronchitis,
pleurisy, pneumonia and quinsy.
To neglect a cold is almost suicide.
To fall to provide ng.alnÂ«st this weil-nlijh
lne\itablo evil ls dangerous negligence.
Peruna ls a safeguard, is a preventive,
a specific; Is a cure for nil cases of ca-
t.-vrrh, acute andÂ«.chronlc, coughs, colds,
consumption, etc. ,- â¢ ;

Peruna:
Miss Kahl Curod of Hemorrhages of
the Lungs by Peruna.
Ml?s Caroline J. Kahl, Otlsco, Ind.,
Eayn: "I had hemorrhages of the lungs
nearly every day for a year, and three
bottles of your Poruna cured me. The
doctors eai<l I had consumption. I am
now In hotter health than I have been
for many years."
MISS CAROLINE J. KAHL.
Mrs. Zonk Cured of Chronic Catarrh
of Ten Years' Standing.
Mrs. Mattie Zenk, 83S Forest avenue,
Onk Park, 111., writes: "I suffered for
ten years with chronic catarrh. The
slightest cold made me very sick. I
could not 6peak aloud for three months.
I took Peruna, and am now in perfect
health; am entirely free from catarrh."
MRS. MATTIE ZENK.
"But It was simply a case of try
something or give up entirely, and so
having often seen the Pyramid Pile Cure
advertised I determined to try It. and
tor two years have never ceased to con-
gratulate myself that I did so, for I have
been entirely cured of rectal troubles and
two packages of the Pyramid removed
every trace of piles. This may sound
far-fetched and overdrawn, but it is ab-
solutely true."
The Pyramid Pile Cure contains no
cocaine, opium nor any Injurious drug
whatever and ls absolutely safe, painless
and effective.

tills remedy tor W cents.
Mrs. Aaron Medron of Savannah, Gtu,
writes: ."Ever since the birth of my first
child, elx years ago, I have suffered
greatly from piles and rectal troubles. ,1
could not bring myself to bear the
thoughts of a surgical operation and had
ai-srays been prejudiced against patent
medicines. *
Thousands of pile sufferers bear Â¦witness
to the inestimable value of the Pyramid
Pile Cure, and even those who have un-
dergone surgical operations without cure
have been happily surprised by results
from a few weeks' treatment with the
Pyramid.
The relief from pain and ltchlnpr Is al-
most instantaneous and the healing oils
and astringents contained in the remedy
gradually and naturally bring about a
complete cure in any form of piles, ltch-
insr. protruding, internal or bleeding-.
Mr. Archie Blrkett of Ionia, Slich.,
writes: "I was troubled with piles so bad
I had to quit work for awhile. I found
no relief until I tried the Pyramid Pile
Cure. I used only two applications and it
cured me almost Instantly. I can truth-
fully recommend the Pyramid Pile Cure
to any sufferer from piles."
Mr. Edward Dunellen of Wllkesbarre,
Pa., says: "For seven years I was scarce-
ly ever free from the itching torment of
piles. . I had used ointments and salves
without number and oftentimes got re-
lief from them, but It took the Pyramid
Pile Cure to make a complete cure and It
did it thoroughly and for eighteen months
I have not had the slightest trace- of
piles. I feel all the more rejoiced be-
cause some of my friends told me I would
never be cured unless I submitted to sur-
gical operation and this I felt I never
could do."

STATE'S SUIT AGAINST A

T. Z. Blakeman, an attorney of San
Francisco, who has represented Mra.
Bell in a number of lepral matters, was
a witness, and the fact of his being armed
with a letter book containing a press copy
of the alleged destroyed letter might have
influenced the defense in producing the
original copy. Mr. Blakeman said that
last/ May Senator Ashe had offered S600
as a part payment of the rent. He also
told of a conversation he had with tne
principal defendant Just before the pres
ent suit was brought, in which the Sena

as he expected money ' from an orange

address at the conference President Green
referred to what had been accomplished In

Stockton asked what the people of the
valley desired In the way ot appropria
tions for improving the Sacramento River
and for the Yuba impounding dam.
Colonel Heuer said that the Upper Sacra

neers having sufficient money at their dis

It was agreed by the conference that'the
California Congressmen should ask for a
clause In the river and harbor bill author
izing the engineers to use the money ap
propriated-for the Lower Sacramento on
any portion of the river desired.. It was
also decided that $300,000 more was needed
for dams ; to Impound mining debris. It
was pointed out that the' delay In startlns
the impounding works already autl-ortzed
was due to the difficulty In securing the

KESWICK. Nov. 24.â Great deposits of
bitumen, indicating the near presence of
petroleum, were discovered near Kes
wick yesterday. Charles W. Pope of San
Francisco and W. W. Shattuck and
Charles Thompson of this place went out
on the sand fiats region six miles east of
Keswick to look at some oil claims the
latter had located a few months ago. A
hundred acres or more of black float had
frequently been passed over by Keswick
citizens as worthless slate. Mr. Pope
examined it and tried it with a flame.
He declared it to be pure bitumen.
As bitumen is a geological transforma
tion of petroleum, the discovery indicates
that this is an oil district. Keswick par
ties have located almost 3000 acres in the.
eand flat region and a meeting was held
by all claimants last night to effect a
union of interests and the organization of
a stock company that shall fully prospect
the sand flats.

Lieutenant Arnold's wife arrived to
night from Portland. She was met at the
train by Naval Constructor Hibbs and L..
Lovejoy of this city. Mrs. Arnold is
loth to believe that her husband has
met serious mishap, though she is at a
loss to account for his sudden disappear
ance. She is prostrated by the news.
Lieutenant Arnold has been in the
T'nitod States navy for fifteen yearB, and
for the past eight years has been a lieu
tenant. He returned from Japan during
the lattor part of the summer and waB
for a time engaged In making inspection
tests of Government vessels built by Pa
cific Coast contractors. He Inspected the
torpedo-boat Goldsborough on her recent
trial trip less than three weeks ago.
He came to Puget Sound for the pur
pose of inspecting the battleship Wiscon
sin, now in the drydock at Port Orchard.
It is understood that it was the depart
ment's intention to assign him perma
nently to the Bremerton station within
the next ten days as engineer In chief.
cers this morning that her husband was
supposed to be at Bremerton, the site of
the Puget Sound station, and communica
tion with the station quickly brought
Commandant W. T. Burwell to this city.
The Pullman porter meanwhile had^notl
ned his conductor of the strange-actions
of Arnold, and the affair had been com
municated to the local railway officials.
To those who have investigated the dis
appearance the circumstances all point to
accidental drowning by fulling through
one of the many treacherous holes An the
planking wkh which Railroad avenue in
the vicinity of where the sleeping car was
standing is iilled. The one circumstance
which in a measure upsets the theory is
the finding of the coat, cap, scarf and shoe
at the foot of Spring street, in a manner
indicating that the articles were deliber
ately placed in the position in which they
were found.
Within fifty yards of where the sleep
ing-car was standing on the side track is
a trap In the planklfig. which is used for
dumping refuse from the dining cars of
both the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern railways. The trap is of suffi
cient dimensions to permit the passage of
a man's body. Twenty yards further on,
in a northeasterly direction from this trap
and near where the clothing was discov
ered, is an open hole directly to the tide
flats below. At Hood tide it is estimated
ten feet of water covers the fiats.

If you find that Marttn assaulted Williams

Williams was to-night found guilty of
manslaughter for the killing of Conductor
William Martin of Oakland in this city
last August. The Jury went out at 1:30
o'clock in the afternoon and returned at
10 o'clock to-night. On the first three
ballots It stood eight guilty to four not
guilty. After long discussions and about
a dozen ballots a compromise was reached
on manslaughter. Two of the Jurors fav
ored hanging and held out a long time be
fore compromising. Williams was ordered
into custody and will be sentenced a week
from Monaay. The penalty for man
slaughter is not to exceed ten years' im
prisonment.
At 1 o'clock this afternoon Judge Jones
read his instructions to the jury. The
courtroom was overcrowded with specta
tors long before the time set for court to
be called. The defendant occupied a chair
between his wife and his mother, near the
rail. He was wonderfully cool and col
lected, but appeared to be less robust than
on the first day of the trial. When the
Judge took his position on the bench the
defendant came forward and took a seat
between his attorneys, John Budd and W.
B. Nutter. District Attorney Ashley was
present as the representative of the peo
ple. After the roll of the Jury had been
called Judge Jones read his instructions.

Powders, lotions, salves, sprays and In-
halers cannot really cure Catarrh, because
this disease is a blood disease, and local
applications, if they accompHsh anything
at all. simply give transient relief.
The catarrhal poison is in the blood and
the mucous membrane" of the nose, throat
and trachea tries to relieve the system by
secreting large quantities of mucus, the
discharge sometimes closing up the nos-
trils dropping into the throat., causing
deafness by closing the Eustachlan tubes,
and after a time causing catarrh of stom-
ach or serious throat and lung troubles.
A remedy to really cure catarrh must be
an Internal remedy which will , cleanse
the blood from catarrhal poison and re-
move the fever and congestion from the
mucous membrane.
The best" and most modern remedies for
this purpose are antiseptics scientifically
known as Eucalyptol, Gualacol. San-
guinarla and Hydrastfn. and while each
of these have been successfully used sep-
arately, yet It has been difficult to get
them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form.
The manufacturers of the new catarrh
cure Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have suc-
ceeded admirably In accomplishing this
result. They are large, pleasant . tasting
lozenges, to be dissolved in the mouth,
thus reaching every part of the mucous
membrane of the throat and finally the
stomach. . .*
Unlike many catarrh remedies. Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate
or any Injurious drug whatever and are
equally beneficial for little children and
adults] "â¢ .
Mr. C. R. Rembrandt : of Rochester. N.
Y., says:" "I know of few people who have
suffered as much as I from Catarrh/ or
the head, throat and stomach. I used
sprays/inhalers and powders for months
at a time with only slight relief and had
no hope of cure. I had not the means to
make a change of climate, which seemed
my only char.ee of cure. . . >
, "Last spring I read an account of some
rerr-arkable cures made by Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and promptly bought a fifty-
cent box from my 'druggist and obtained
buch positive benefit from that one pack-
age that â¢â¢ I - continued to ; use them : dally

from the disgusting annoyance of catarrh;

ask and my hearing, which had begun to
fail as a result of the catarrh, has greatly
improved, : until I feel I can hear as well
as ever. .They are a household necessity
In my family."

had a very sever? iÂ«r>ell of sickness. 1 was ex-
tremely sick for three weeks, and when I

with excructrUlnR pains In my back. My water
at times locked very Ilk- coffee. I could pass
hut little at a time, and then only after Buf-
fering Kreat pain. My physical condition was
such that I had *no strrnzth and was all run
down. The doctors ?ald my kidneys were not
affected, b'jt 1 felt certain that they were
the cauÂ«e of my trouble. My sister, Mrs. C.
E. Ltttlcfleld. of Lynn advised me to give Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial. I procured a
bottle and inside of three days commenced to
Ret relief. I followed up that bottle with an-
other and at the completion of this one found
I was completely cured. My strength returned.

COMMITTEE OF STANFORD
PARISH AT A BANQUET
It Beems that the Panama, people are
dissatisfied with the way the Paciflo
Mall, and the Southern Pacinc Company
have treated them and unless a more satis
factory contract can be patched up be
tween now and the first of the month the
Panama Company will enter the field as
a competitor of the Pacinc Mail, offering
cut rates to its patrons between here and
Panama, Connection is to be made witn
steamers on the Eastern coast, making
Colon their terminus. The plan is to have
the steamers leave this city and Panama
every two weeks beginning tha middle 0*
September.
The Bteamers will bÂ« of sufficient ton
nage and speed to attract the best kind
of business and at the same time the
rates will be lower than have been offer
ed heretofore. It is understood that a
conference is to be held in New York City
next week to see if the Pacific Mall and
the Panama Company cannot come to an
amicable understanding, as it is general
ly conceded that the inauguration of a
new line by the Panama people would
raise havoc with the now exclusive ser
vice of the Pacific Mail Company.

pany is in the city negotiating for the
lease of three large vessels -for use be

Mr. Booth also said that, with the in
creasing output of butter in California, the
Idea was commonly entertained that the
Eastern markets would have to be sought
to dispose of the surplus. "Through the
association,' 1 he said, "brokers and agents
can be employed in the East to furnish
needed information and also to dispose of
goods placed In their hands. By cqmbined
effort it would be possible to prevent t!ie
sale of any oleomargarine or other substi
tute for butter in this State. Hope is en
tertained that, in time, some plan may be
formulated by which the products of Cali
fornia creameries and dairies may be im
proved in quality. The association may
become strong enough to employ practical
creamery men to send to the creameries
to demonstrate wherein mistakes' have
been made, for the purpose of paving the
way for improvement.
San Francisco has a dairy exchange or
ganization. F. E. Booth Is the president.
F- |W; Van Sicklen the vice president and
A. 11. Hills treasurer. The has
not been chosen, but the officers who have
been entrusted with procuring rooms, that
the exchange may be ready to do business,
are also authorized to secure a secretary.
A commute on organization has been ap
pointed by President Booth, consisting of
F. B. Brig-ham, Adolph Lorsbach, B. F.
Harvill, F. V. Nelson and Julian New
bauer, who will report .at a meeting to be
held next Wednesday. In a very short
time the exchange will be in operation.
All the necessary preliminary steps have
been taken to call it into existence.
President Booth explained the purpose of
the new exchange to be the holding of a
daily meeting, where the conditions of the
market for butter, eggs and cheese may
be considered and proper Quotations pre
pared for the press. Any dairyman and
ail interested parties will have access to
the quotations. This is one of the objects,
but what further scope may be taken
President Booth could not say definitely.
The association will be upon lines similar
to those of kindred organizations in the
Eastern States, which are admitted to be
of g.vat benefit to the producer and to the
seller.

"The South's cotton productions are not

the congress can be of great > benefit in
better regulating the shipment of cotton.

I Issued the call for the Maritime Con
gress." Â¦ '
"1 have received favorable responses
from all parts of the country on the
plan to assemble the congress. I called
the congress for the purpose of inaugurat
ing a movement to restore the Southern
maritime trade, which was lost durinj tue
war of secession. Since the war no move
ment of the kind has been instituted,
though the merchant marine has not been
what the South's resources justified. At
the request of, merchants, railroad men
and shipowners of | Georgia ports,* I la
sued a call for the congress to rssemble
at Brunswick, expecting ail parties inter
ested in the trade to attend. I believe
the movement will result in much good by
building up Georgia and Southern ports
and enlarging tne circulation of the
South's resources. From the replies j
have received I am assured the congress
will be well attended.

HOPES TO RESTORE
SOUTHERN TRADE
If the final contemplated Improvement . of our
harbor were a completed fact to-day, our city
would be at least sharing in the immense trans
port business now exclusively, confined to and
so greatly benefiting San Francisco. :
The whole matter may bÂ«. summed, up in a
single statement, to wi*-. With the completion
of the contemplated ; Improvement. - that desid
eratum of commerce would here be met â name-*
ly, thÂ« bringing together of ship and car. Â¦Six
miles of water front would offer facilities for
this, facilities unequaled by any port in < the
United States. Â¦
If this be true to-Â«ay. who can predict the
pocslbllltles of thÂ« future. In view, of the com
mercial traffic of the Pacific Ocean, now start
ing 1 into life with the settlement of the policy
of legitimate expansion, and bidding fair in the
near future to rival' that of the Atlantic? In-
The only thing that originally prevented this
was the challowness of the water on this side
of the bay. The improvement of the Oakland
harbor means the i practical removal of , this
obstacle, making It possible for the largest sea
going vessels to He at our future wharves | in
a perfectly land-locked and thoroughly aecure
harbor. - . Â¦ ' Â¦ .'".- - , r -,". , :. . ' ;\ Â¦
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf Is going
to make the imorovement of Oakland
harbor his special work at the coming
session of Congress. Mr. Metcalf has al
ways held the opinion that Oakland har
bor should be developed as rapidly as pos
sible in order that Oakland shall reach
its commercial growth as it has its resi
dence growth. Mr. Metcalf believes that
Oakland should have and Â¦ might have
some share in the transport business of
the army if it had proper harbor facili
ties. In a signed article Congressman Met
calf says:
This city being situated on the- mainland
would naturally be the terminus of the over
land railroads in fact, as now It Is In name;
and here there should be also the warehouses
and factories which cluster around such, a

To ehnre In this coming activity the Im

to speedy consummation.
As the representative In Congress of this con

ably connected with this great accomplishment.
It is therefore, quite unnecessary fcr me to
say that neither time, energy nor whatever I
may possets of ability shall be spared In push

final completion. â
.In view of its magnitude and Importance, all

Ee not disturbed: there Is no danger from
empire; there is no fear for the republic
Vioe President-elect Roosevelt followed
Mr. McKinley. He said in part:
There was no doubt about our position before
the election and there is no doubt about U now.
We are going to carry on the policy that has
been pursued during the past four years. It
has beea the signal good fortune of this nation
on the first occasion when It mixed in ths
world's politics to fix the standard to which
the other nation*, of the world will come In
dealing with the affairs of the great Asiatic
nations. We have kept the currency sound. Â»> e
have kept the gold standard for the past four
years and it will be kept In the coming years.
And the cation has decided that the flag shall
float over the Philippine Islands. Peace shall
come to them as a constantly increasing meas
ure of self-government will be given them. but.
first cf all, order must be restored In them.
Gentlemen, I am sure that I state your views
when I say that every rational effort for the
betterment of the condition of either the wage
earner or the tiller of the soil will have the
heartiest support of the Republican party; thai
we realize that the welfare of the nation de
pends ultimately, more than all else, upon
the welfare of the wage worker and of the man
who tills the soil.
I feel that we are to be congratulated, not
merely as Republicans, but as Americans, be
cause we approach the twentieth century in
the knowledge that this people have, with
seriousness of purpose, set their faces to a
proper solution of the many problems which a
great nation has to meet and which this nation
must solve alike in its home policy and In .<lo-
Inr its share of the world's work that con
fronts all the greet world powers.
At the conclusion of the dinner the

PHILADELPHIANS
GREET McKINLEY
President Makes Ante-Elec
tion Speech in Quaker
City.
Says Besnlt Is CTot a Personal or
Party Triumph, but a Plain
Declaration by the
People.
TVe may differ as to the extent of Influence
of thÂ« several issues involved, but we are all
agreed as to certain things which "it settled.
It records the unquestioned indorsement of the
pol3 stariard, industrial independence, broader
markets, commercial expansion. reciprocal
trade, the open door In China, the Inviolability
of public faith, the independence and authority
of the judiciary and peace and beneficent gov
ernment unfler American sovereignty in the
Philippine!. American credits are unimpaired.
thÂ« honor of the American flag unsullied and
the obligations cf a righteous war and treaty
of ;rtcÂ« unrepudiaied.
Tne Republican party feas placed npon It tre
zsendous responsibilities. No party could acic
for a higher expression of confidence. It is a
great thing to have this confidence; it Vrill be
a. greater thing to deserve and hold it. To this
party are committed new and grave problems.
They are too exalted for partisanship. The
taÂ«k of vattlernent Is for the whole American
people. Who will say they are unequal to it?
Liberty has not lost, but gained In strength.
The structure .of the fathers stands secure upon
tfc* foundation on which they raised it, and
Some C'.sappolntments follow all elections.
But all isen rejoice when an election li so de
cisive aÂ» to admit cf neither dispute nor con
test. The value of m. national victory can only
fce rightly measured and appreciated by what
!Â¦ averts, as well aa by what it accomplishes.
It is fortunate for the party in power if it un
derstands the true meaning of the result. These
charred by the people with the administration
and legislation are required to interpret as well
as to educate the publie will and Us rightful
Interpretation Is essential to its faithful exe
cution. We cannot overestimate the great ira
pcrtanee and the fax-reaching consequences of
the electoral contest which ended on the 6th of
>>*ovember. It has to me no personal phase.
It Is not the triumph of an individual, nor al
together of a party, but an emphatic declara
tion by the pecple of what they believe and
would have maintained in government. A great
Variety cf subjects was presented and dii
ecssed in the prcgress of the campaign.
Nothisg la Government can be more impres
sive than a national election, where the people
delicate the power and invest their constitu
ticnal agents with authority to execute their
IÂ«Â»h#i5ts. ThÂ« very character cf the transaction
clothes it with solemnity. It ie a serious busi
ness. Its Issues are always momentous. What
a lessen in self-government it teaches. Sixteen
rrillica voters on the same day. throughout
every section cf the United States, depositing
their mandate and recording their will. Done
by the people In their own communities, tn the
very precincts of the home, under the supervi
sion cf their fellow citizens and chosen offl
clalf and, to Insure its freedom and independ
ence, the ballot a secret one*. God forbid that
any 'citizen selected for that s acred trust should
Â«^er attempt to divert the will of the sovereign
people or tamper with the sanctity of their
t&ilots.
U*Â« are aiways in danger of exaggeration on
cx"c&ti':r.s of exultation over a political vic
t iry. ar.<3 while the result iÂ» mainly due to the
tfrorts of our splendid party, there is some
times a tendency to give too little credit to
other forces which, silent though they rr.ay
have l-e*n. were r.one the less potential. We
must not withhold generous, acknowledgement
â¢ren that great body of our citizens -who. be
ler-jflng to another party, powerfully assisted
in the achievement cf the result which you
celebrate to-night, ncr for that other large
boÂ£r. former member* of our own party, who.
Mrftk honesty of purpose separated from us a
:eiv years ago on financial issues, but have
now returned and are home again to stay. Nor
i* any accounting for the victory either Just
cr accurate which leaves out of the calcula
tion the almost unbroken column of labor en
pape-i in mechanics and airriculture. which re
je<*ted th# fatal doctnn6 of cla^s distinction ax
having no place in this republic and which
rebuked those teachings which would destroy
the faith cf American manhood in American
character aci American institutions. The bus
iness men In every part of the country, typi
*>.<r-i by this great organization, were a roightr
factor in the recent contest. And may we not
airo ascribe rr.uch to the Influence of the homÂ«.
with Its affiliations? In any previous election
Â¦was it greater or la any did the counsels of the
fire-side determine more largely the votÂ« of the
*!Â«Â»<: tor*?
Gentlemen o? the Union League: An after
dinner speech is to me always a difficult per
formance. ar.d an after-election epeech after a
cUnatr is & still more difficult tajk. and I shall
Â«lo little more tiian make an acknowledgment
Co t-tie patriotic association for it unceasing
loyalty to ttie Government; for the earnest
euppcrt it has given to the present adrninistra
i:â¢â¢:." la the trying years through which it has
passed, and express my sinct-re thanks for the
pri-at honor tbiÂ« meeting and demonstration
tr;r.pt me. which should be shared by niy <iis
ti^sulshtd associate on the national ticket, the
Y'.ee President-elect, as well as by those asso
daieS 'Â¦ith xr.e m the conduct of public affairs.
The party was driven to the residence
cf E. T. ittotsbury and at 6 o'clock w t nt
to the Union League. Broad street, in
front of the clubhouse, was crowded. As
the President stepped from his carriage
and made his way up the steps of tne
building he was vociferously cheered. In
cicie the clubhouse the members crowded
about the Chief Executive, who was com
pelled to submit to much handshaking.
The party then proceeded to the- ban
quet room, wtere cavers tad beea laid for
Â£44 persons.
Following iÂ«f the text of President Mc-
ICiniey's ej>eech:
ThÂ« streets along the route were lined
with'efceerlsgr crowds and the President
6eerne8 greatly pleased with the cordial
reception, come business houses and
residences were decorated, with tiie na
tional colors.
The Presidential party arrived here
with a epeciai train over the Pennsyl
vania at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon and
waa net at the station by a committee of
T_'nicn League members. Carriages were
in waiting and the party was driven
through the principal streets in the cen
ter of the city, escorted by the First City
Trocp. An immense throng was In wait
lr.g at the 6tation and the appearance of
the President was the signal for an en
thusiastic outbreak of applause. Women
waved handkerchiefs and silk fiags and
men raised their hats as President Mc-
Kirley passed. From the train to his
carriags ilr. ilcKinley carried his silk
hat in his band and bowed in acknowl
edgement of the ovation extended him.

This opposition has been more than once effective against
appropriations j for Government irrigation works in the West, and
there is reason to apprehend that its effectiveness will . be felt in
the future. It would seem, then, that the Western irrigators
should seek the means for an object lesson otherwise than by
direct appropriation. Such means may be readily found in. the
leasing to stockmen of the public domain in the arid region wher
ever the highest value of; the land is for grazing, and the devotion
of the proceeds ; to installing; Government reservoirs to hold the
storm water and It to land that -may be cultivated Â¦ if steadily suira'llM

The i three subjects, leasing, the", ranges.' preservation of the forests and stor
age of water, for irrigation, are so closely related ,that they must go toKethet-7n
order for any one of them to be successful.;, Primarily, they arc all .Western inter
ests, â¢Â¦ located In the same field, covering the earns territory. Western men muat

The statement is current that Eastern manufacturers see in
the development of the arid region, and its subjection to settle
ment, a desirable enlargement of their home market. Against
this is the objection of the Eastern land owner to Government
appropriations to bring land into competition with his own â to
the reduction of its value.
He seems to have much reason on his side when he declares
that he is not the beneficiary of public appropriations. The Gov
ernment has done nothing to make or keep his land fertile; there
fore why should he be made, an involuntary contributor to the fer
tility of land the products of which will compete with his in the
final market? .
I HE control of the National Irrigation Congress has grad
1 ually drifted from the arid region to the East. The change
is now accomplished, and is too recent to enable definite
judgment of the effect upon the .interests involved.

After the breakfast Mr. Teller makes a magnificent speech in Rose's honor, in which he tells
how many times he has acted before the Queen. Mrs. Telfer tells how many times she has played
tragedv-mieer.s and declares that "as parts they are not worth a tinker's oath." Arthur makes a ter
rible mess of resoondini? to the toast of Rose's health. Rose, after mounting a chair excitedly to de
liver her farewell speech, breaks down crying at the prospect of leaving her old friends. So ends the
first act. '
Â¦ The second act shows us Rose living "on approval" with Arthur^ highly respectable family.
Vice Chancellor Sir William Gower. Arthur's grandfather, is a testy old gentleman, who will allow
no noise in the house while he is taking his after-dinner nap. who grows furious if any one disturbs
his game of whist, and who cannot endure the sound of a piano, although he has one in his draw
ing-room. Poor Rene like-; to sing, to talk and to laugh; she rebels against the numerous "rules
of the house." and Arthur is powerless to help her. One evening, after all the household but herself
had retired. Rose receives a message to say that Coloovs. Wrench, Gadd and Avonia are waiting in
the street to see her: just. then it comes on to rain violently. Rose of course brings them In out of
the storm. She is delighted to see them, enjoins them to be very qui;t, but Gadd and Coloovs eet
into a quarrel that rouses the household: the irate Sir William appears and berates Rose's friends as
"gypsies." This she indignantly resents: releases Arthur, telling him that she is sure she has made a
mistake, and then leaves the house with her old comrades, exclaiming "Back to The Wells again, back
to The Wells."
So Rose returns to The Wells (Act III), but alas! she Is soon discharged, for she has lost the trick
of handling the trash which in the old plays she once thought gold. "We are only dolls," she says
to Avonia. "partly human, with mechanical limbs that WILL fall into stagey postures, and "heads
stuffed with savings o'it of rubbishy plays. It isn't THE world we live in. merely A worldâ such .1
queer little one! I was less thin a month in Cavendish Square, and very few people came there: but
they were REAL people â REAL! For a month I lost the smell of gas and oranges, and the hurry and
noise, and the dirt and the slang, and the clownish ioking .it The Wells. I didn't realize at the
time the change was going on in me. I didn't realize it till I came back. And then, by decrees. I
discovered what had hippened." :
Avonia condoles with her, but she has her own troubles, issct forth in 'he following scene. Gadd
(nimv truirried to Avonia) enter'; with a wild look:
TOM â Anything wrong. Gadd?
GADDâ Wrong! wrong! n-hat d'ye think?
AVON I Aâ Tell us!V
GADD â I have been asked to appear in the pantomime!
AVONIAâ (Shocked).' Oh. Ferdy! You!
GADD â I, a sqrious actor if ever there was one, a poetic actor â !
AVONIAâ What part. Ferdy?
GADD â The insult, the bitter insult! The gross indignity!
AVONIAâ What part, Ferdy?
GADDâ I have not been seen in pantomime. for 3'ears, not since I shook the dust of the T. R. Stock
1 ton from mv feet.
AVONIAâ Fcrdv. what part? ,' â¢:-
GADD â I simplv looked at Burroughs, when he preferred his request and swept from the theater.
AVONIA-What part. Ferdy?
GADD â A part. too. which Is seen for a moment at the opening of the pantomime and not again till
its close.
j AVONIAâ Ferdy!
GADDâ Eh?
AVONIAâ What part?
GADD â A character called the Demon of Discontent.
(Rose turns away to the fireplace; Tom curls himself up on the sofa and is seen to shake with.
. laughter.)
AVONIA â (Walking about indignantly). Oh! (Returning to Gadd). Oh, it's a rotten part! Rose,
dear, I assure you, as artist to artist, that part is absolutely rotten. (To Gadd) â You won't clay
it, darling?
GADDâ (Rising). Play it! I would see The Wells in ashes first!
AVONIA â We shall lose our engagements, Ferdy. I know Burroughs; we shall be out. both
of us.
GADDâ Of course we shall. D'ye think I have not counted the cost?
AVONIAâ (Putting her hand in "his). I don't mind, dearâ for the sake of your positionâ (strucV
COLPOYSâ (Outside). Is Gadd here, Miss Trelawny?
COLPOYSâ I want to see him.
GADDâ "Wrench. I'll trouble you. Ask Mr. Colpoys whether he approaches me as a friend, an acquaint.
ance, or in his capacity of stage manager at The Wellsâ the tcol of Bunourhs. ; , ~-=
(Tom opens the door slightly. Gadd and Avonia Join Rose at the fireplace.) Â¦
T0M-(At the door, solemnly). Colpoya, are you here as Gadd s bosom friend, or as a mere tool of
Burroughs? . â . _ V Â¦ -J" '
(An inaudible colloquy follows between Tom and Colpoys. Tom's head is outside the door; his lers
are seen to move convulsively, and the sound of suppressed laughter Is heard.)
GADDâ (Turning). Well, well? , ,
TOMâ (Closing the dcor sharply and facing Gadd with great seriousness). He Is hero as tha tool of
Burroughs.
GADDâ 1 will receive him. ...
(Tom admits Colpoys, who carries a mranlr.g looking part and a letter.)
COLPOYSâ (After formally bowing to the ladies). Oh, oadd. Mr. Burroughs instructs me to ofter you
this part In the pantomimeâ (handing the part to Gadd)â Demon of Discontent.
(Gadd takes the part and flings it to the ground; Avonia picks it up and reads it.)
COLPOYS-You refuse it? ,_
GADDâ I do. (With dignity.) Acquaint Mr. Burroughs with mv decision, and add that I hope his pan
tomime will prove an utterly worthless one. May Boxing night, to those unfortunate enough to find
themselves in the theater, long remain a dismal memory, and may succeeding audiences, scanty and
dissatisfiedâ!- (Colpoys presents Gadd with the letter. Gad-i opens it and reads.) I leave! (Sitting.)
The Romeo, the Orlando, the Cliffordâ leaves!
AVONIAâ (Coming to Gadd. indicating some lines in the part.) .Ferdy, this ain't so bad. (Reading.)
Â¦'I'm Discontent! From Orkney's Isle to Dover
/ To make men's bile bile-over I endoverâ "
GADDâ 'Vonla! (Taking the part from Avonia with mingled surprise and pleasure.) Ho, ho! No. that'*
not bad. (Reading.) i ./ ... , ..
'â¢Tempers, though sweet. I whip up to a lather.
; ;.., - Makr wives hate husbands, sons wish fathers farther."
'Vonia, there's something to lay hold of here. (Rising.) Gus, I have thought this over. I PLAY IT!
(They all pather round r.nd congratulate him.)
That is the sharpest stroke of satire ever directed against the store. I wender that Mr. Pinero found
an actor willing to play this part. â¢ ; ? â¢ But to our story. Rose Is discharged, but she- finds an unex
pected friend in Sir William, who comes to ask her help in his search for Arthur, who has disappeared. This
help Rose cannot give, for she does not know that for love of her Arthur has left his home to become an
actor. Her forlorn condition touches the old man's heart, and when he hears that Tom trench and Imo
gen want eight hundred pounds to brinp out Tom's play, wherein Rose is to play the leading: part. Sir
William agrees to supply the money. The act closes (somewhat weakly) with Tom reading his play to Sir
William and his new-made friends of the profession. , â¢
The fourth and last act shows the first rehearsal of Tom Wrench s play, 'Life. It contains a most
amusing sketch of an old-fashioned actor and stage manager. O'Dwyer, wMo Is placed In sharp enntrast
-w'th Wrench and Imogen, representing tho new school of management and aetlns. Sir William, still testy
but evidently softening, comes to the rehearsal; he is grieved at the loss of his grandson, and when that
lo*t grandson appears (sonu what too opportunely) as an actor In Life, the old man can hold out no
longer. Arthur is forgiven, and Tomâ well, poor Tom makes belleve^that he Is happy^ because she Is happy.
Though far less common than they were forty years ago. there Is not one of the theatrical types here
represented but has Its original on the stage to-day. I have known them, every one: had you. good reader,
known them also, I am sure that you could not fall to bÂ« to their faults a little blind, and to their many
virtues very kind.
But if we may not see 'Trelawny" we may at ieflist read it. Mr. R. H. Russell has published it
in sumptuous style, and to him I am indebted for being able to give some account of it to-day.
The period depicted is that of the early sixties â the time when Tom Robertson was struggling for
recognition; when "Naturalism" in playwriting and "Repression" in acting were unknown; when
ladies wore crinolines and when the vast majority of English-speaking people still considered it
wicked to go to the theater. * * * The scene of the first act is the sitting-room of Mr. and Mrs.
Telfer, tragedian and tragedienne of the Bagnigge Wells Theater. Preparations are being made for
a breakfastâ a farewell breakfast to Miss Rose Trelawny. leading juvenile lady of The Wells, who is
about to resign from the company in order to marry Mr. Arthur Gower, non-professior.a!, and mem
ber of a highly respectable Presbyterian family that detests the theater. "Rose is 19. wears washed
muslin and looks divine. She has much of the extravagance of gesture, over-emphasis in speech
and freedom of manner engendered by the theater, but is craceful and charming, nevertheless."
Bidden to the breakfast are Miss Imogen Parrott. leading, lady at the Olympic Theater, and
Rose's fellow actors at The Wells: Gadd, the leading juvenile man; Colpoy3. the Low Comedian:
Avonia Bunn. the Soubrctte. and Tom Wrench. Utility. (The last mentioned is understood to be a
character sketch of Tom Robertson.) Here is a specimen of the inimitable theatrical chat thit ore
cedes the breakfast:
/ GADD â (Coming to Imogen in an elegant, languishing way). Imogen, my darling fleissinsc
Â¦j her). Kiss Ferdy.
IMOGEN' â Well. Gadd. how goes it â I mean how are you?
GADD â (Earnestly) I'm hitting them hard this season, my darling. To-night. Sir Thoma3 Clif
ford. They're simply waiting for my Clifford.
IMOGEN â But who on earth is your Julia?
GADDâ Ah! Airs. Telfer GOES ON for itâ a venerable stop-gap. Absurd, of course: but we
daren't keep my Clifford from them any longer.
â¢ IMOGENE â You'll miss Rose Trelawny in business pretty badly, I expect, Gadd?
GADD â (With a shrug of the shoulders). She was to have done Rosalind for my benefit. M133
Fitzhugh joins on Monday: I must pull HER through it somehow. I would reconsider my bill,
but they're waiting for my Orlando, waiting for it. (Colpoys enters â an insignificant, wizen little
fellow who is unable to forget that he is a low comedian. He stands L, squinting hideously at
Imogen and indulging in extravagant gestures of endearment, while she continues her conver
sation with Gadd)
COLPOYS â (Failing to attract her attention). Mv love, my life!
IMOGEN â (Noddirrg to him indifferently). Good afternoon, Augustus.
COLPOYS â Ridiculously). She speaks! She hears me!
A B LETTâ (The waiter)â holding his glove before his mouth, convulsed with laughterâ Ho, hÂ»!
Oh. Mr. Colpoys! Oh. reelly, sir! Ho dear!
GADD â (To Imogen, darkly). Colpoys is not nearly as funny as he was last year. Everybody'3
saying so. We want a low comedian badly.
DURING the ten weeks that Mr. Henry Miller was in San Francisco last summer there Â»epose.J
in his trunk the manuscripts of two plays that he would have presented had not that Young
Person's Delight, "Heartsease," attracted such crowds of tear-bedewed maidens that he could
not afford to withdraw it. These two plays were â¢"The Importance of Being Earnest." a mas
terpiece in its class, and Pinero's comedietta of theatrical life "Trelawny of The Wells." When Mr.
Miller returns to us it will not be under the management of Mr. Frohman, who owns the Amei
can right to these two plays; it is not probable, therefore, that we shall ever see them, and for this
deprivation we are indebted, be it ever remembered, to the success ot that third-rate sentimentality.
'"Heartsease."
The press of the country should hasten to assure Bishop Pot
ter of its sympathy in the great and practical and Christian work
he has set for himself.
Impatience for results must be avoided. The cancerous evils
to be extirpated have been long in taking root; they cannot be
destroyed in a day.
That city has had the Parkhurst and Lexow investigations.
The 'first, unfortunately, seemed planned and carried out for sen
sational and the second for partisan purposes. The Bishop seems
clearly desirous of avoiding both. In declaring that New York is
to be morally redeemed, not by emotion, nor denunciation, nor
pessimism, and that, in the work, differences in nationality, relig
ion and' politics must be laid aside and forgotten, he. exhibits
a practical purpose that goes straight to one object, ignoring all
else. . .1
He means that if Tammany itself, even though it be now the
bloated, and blotched beneficiary of the sins of the city, shall offer
to elect upright courts and reform the police methods and enforce
the law, and its good faith is in -positive evidence, those who aim
at the moral result alone should accept even Tammany as the in
strument of regeneration. But if, on the other hand, Tammany,
the responsible protector of all that makes the city as foul as
Sodom, shall show a skin impervious to public opinion, the
Bishop's idea involves the impression of the conscience of men
hitherto the supporters of Tammany, to an extent that will with
draw them from its support and give their strength to any move
ment in politics that is pledged to enforce the law and minimize
vice.
- A committee of 25.000 led by such" men as William E.
Dodge, Charles S. Fairchild,' George Foster Peabody, Seth Low,
Bishop Potter, Minot J. Savage, Father Ducey and Father, Mc-
Glynn, would peacefully revolutionize that city in a year without
stepping a hand's breadth outside the law.
To exactly follow the methods of the old committee of San
Francisco in New York City would be injurious to the whole
country, for it would be misunderstood by the world. Therefore
this cannot be meant by Bishop Potter. An observer, at this
distance, with the perspective of a continent between us and the
scene, would interpret the Bishop's meaning- to be that a cleans
ing committee of 25,000 shall use the means of publicity, turn a
searchlight upon the hideous vices planted for profit in New York
by its present rulers, and so influence public opinion as to compel
enforcement of the law by those whose duty it is to administer it.
Its proceedings were singularly dispassionate. Mere revenge
had no apparent place ( in its proceedings. Personal motives were
absent. Its sole animus was a desire to cleanse San Francisco of
crime, for the public good. Its work was effective, but it had no
legal sanction. , * v
But it had no legal existence. Its sole reason for being at
all was the failure of the law in the hands of .those charged with
its execution.
It has not since been questioned that the conclusions
reached by the committee were righteous. It took life, but it gave
the accused a trial. In a way it preserved the forms of law and
was respectful of the established rules of evidence.
Our committee was an extra-legal body. It was not organ
ized to ! aid courts and officers of the law in performance of their
statutory duty. It took the place of the legal authority, and with
no warrant except force, the power to have its way, proceeded
to administer justice in its own fashion. It was not a mob, nor a
legal body, nor an adviser and abettor of the public authorities
in enforcing order. It did not resemble any organization nor
movement that preceded it, nor have any since, its day resembled
it. It was peculiar and individual, with no past example nor pre
cedent to follow. In its presence courts were paralyzed, their ex
ecutive officers were silent, their processes were suspended. The
committee was not created to help the constituted authorities en
force the law. It enforced the" law primarily, itself, by , its own
process and decree. *
BISHOP POTTER is in earnest in his determination to im
prove the morals of New York City.
His suggestion that a vigilance committee of 25,000
men be organized needs some explanation, because he cites the
Vigilance Committee of San Francisco as a model. ..â¢_ ,

NEW YORK, Nov. 24.-A Journal spe
cial from Rome says: In spite of all de
nials, official and otherwise, it Is certain
to-day that the life of Leo XIII hangs
literally by a single thread and that his
death may be expected at any moment.
Always fragile in appearance he has
now become so emaciated that he looks
like a mere spectre. He can no longer
walk unassisted, but spends the greater
part of the day lying or. a couch and Is
unable to take or retain any solid foo<3
His regular hours of meals have been"
abandoned and he is now fed, whenever
hungry, with eggs beaten In old. marsala
biscuits dipped in old port wine and choc
olate beaten with eggs, which alone serve
to sustain his waning forces.
His medical attendants, Drs. Laponl ard
Mazzon . have taken up their residence 'at
the Vatican and take it in turns to remain
constantly with the aged pontiff by night
and by day, while his Lody servant Cen
tral noyer leaves his 'Bide, even taking
his meals in the private apartments of the
Pope. His position is no sinecure, for ha
is compelled to give Leo XIII almost the
game attention that one would give a
child.

Her Welfare.

Ing all day to-day of what this wonder
ful worldy to which she Is accredited is
like, while friends of her family showered
congratulations upon her parents and
wished her, through them, long and happy
life.
Several years ago the fortune of Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt, the baby's grand
father, was estimated at $75,000,000. It has
grown steadily since then, and although
there is no exact estimate up to date, his
three children, one of whom Is the new
baby's father, may look forward to an in
heritance of thirty or forty millions
apiece.
The baby is such an extremely good in
fant, and both mother and baby axe In
such good health, that the physicians
were able to give the patient In charge of
the nurses soon after midnight.
All day long a stream of visitors, in
quiring for mother and child, intermingled
with messenger boys and florists and de
livery men, went up and down the steps
of the house.
The baby's layette is probably unsur
passed, even among Vanderbilt babies,

CONGRATULATIONS TO
MRS. W. K. VANDERBILT
"While those people are always repre
sented in Washington," said Mr. Morgan,
"they have never been known to make a
tangible proposition. The only thing they
have ever proposed is that the United
States go Into partnership with the
French company. This, on Its face, is ri
diculous. The Panama Canal Company
Is composed of some 400,000 Frenchmen
and a partnership of this kind would
mean war between the United States and
France in a short time. Some $200,000,000
has already been spent on the Panama ca
nal, and it fs yet' far from completion.
The company has more millions to spend,
but its managers realize that if the United
States constructs a canal they can never
hope to compete with it.
VIn this connection I will make a predic
tion that twenty years after the opening
of an isthmian canal owned and operated
by the United States the use of the canal
will be made free to the commerce of the
world, and from the first year tolls can
be reduced to one-third of those charged
by the Suez canal and still provide a rev
enue which will pay interest on the cost
of construction and provide a sinking fund
which In ten' years will entirely reimburse
the United States for the amount . ex
pended.
"To build a canal we now have In the
treasury $113,000,000 of the Pacific Railway
fund. This money could . not be put to
better use. We also have a surplus reve
nue of $80,000,000 a year, and the revenue
of two years would be sufficient to con
struct the canal.
The result would probably have been
slightly different if the Panama represen
tatives had been able to make a definite
proposition, or willing to sell to the United
States. They are not willing to sell and
are not able to sell, and the American-
Panama Canal Company of New Jersey,
formed for the purpose of taking over the
canal from the French corporation, did
not even show that It could get possession
of the property.
Senator Morgan of Alabama, who has
been a most consistent advocate of the
Nicaragua canal, to-day, in speaking of
canal legislation, made the following very
important statement:
"I am in favor of the treaty and I am
in favor of the Nicaragnan Canal bill. I
find nothing to conflict in either. Of
course. In ratifying the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty we do not regard it as absolutely
essentlal to the construction of the
"Do you look for opposition to the
treaty from Senators who regard the for
tification of the canal as essential?" Sen
ator Morgan was asked.
"Of course it is impossible to tell the
extent of the opposition, but no Bane
man regards the fortification of tho canal
as essential. The desire to make use of
the treaty against the administration in
the campaign may have led some to op
pose it at the last session, but with poli
tics out of the way. I should like to see
any man bring forward a valid argument
against any provision of the treaty. No
ono with any judgment will ciitend that
the canal should be fortified. * A propo
sition of that kind is simply ridiculous.
No proposition was ever neard of to
fortify the Suez Canal and no suggestion
of this kind would be countenanced for a
minute by European powers. The canat
should be defended by the navy. Ships
of any enemy of the United States mak
ing use of the canal could be disposed of
one by one as they emerged from it.
They would have to come through singly
and would thus lose their effectiveness as
a fleet." i /""
Speaking of what might be expected of
representatives of the Panama Canal
Company, Mr. Morgan expressed a belief
that their efforts would avail nothing.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HCK
TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.-T; the
friends of the Panama Canal Company
the news this morning that the Isthmian
Canal Commission would report in favor
of the Nicaraguan route caused bitter dis
appointment. Representatives of the
Panama company asserted that the Nic
aragua canal would never bo built; that
they would throw diplomatic and other
objections in Its way, and as fcr the
transcontinental railroads, they nad not
beg-un to fight yet. The Panama element
had been expecting an engineering report
from the commission favorable to the
Panama route. They based this on the
fact that they had already received as
surances from tnÂ© commission of engi
neers appointed to visit Panama that they
would report to the full commission that
the route of the French canal waa feas
ible. As the next step they hoped that
enough of the other members of the com
mission would Join In supporting the
Panama company to give them a ma
jority. < -
How the Panama Interest made its
miscalculation is interesting. The com
mission consists of nine member? -Hear

In dividing up the work Etnst, Morrison
and Burr were the committee on Nicara
gua Pascoe waa assigned to diplomatic
work, Haupt to statistics and Johnson to
the economic questions involved.
It will be seen that Burr was on both
the Panama and Nicaragua committees
and visited both routes.
The Panama committee reported first
and showed that the problem of water
supply in the dry season could be "solved
by the construction of an enormous, reser
voir, so that the canal would have plenty
of water. Friends of the Panama jumped
at the conclusion that their route would
be favored and the United States be In
duced to go into partnership. But "when
the Nicaragua route was favored by the
other committee and Professor Burr, who
is on both commissions, decided in favor
of the Nicaragua as against the Panama,
the French canal scheme suffered a severe
blow. It Is said on reliable authority that
whereas at , one time the commission
seemed to be, evenly divided, * with one

wrong in his accounts. Mr. Redington
would neither affirm nor deny this rumor,
but said Bonnell and his brother were dis
charged for neglecting their duties. â¢ ,
His disappearance was not made public
until last Friday, wheri his wife reported
the matter to the police, who to-day sent
out a general alarm.
Mr. Bonnell was about five feet seven
Inches in height, of light complexion and
cleanly shaven. He wore a mixed goods
suit or clothes, whito shirt with three gold
studs in the bosom and'a derby hat when
he left his home.
Bonnell is well known In San Francisco,
where his father holds a responsible posi
tion, and members of the family have al
ways been welcomed In the best social cir
cles.
Mr. Bonnell was very popular with the
proprietors and patrons of the Clarenden.
which Is one of the exclusive hostelries of
the borough across the river. It was dis
covered, however, that he was making a
habit ot betting on horse races, and on
the afternoon of September 22 he was dis
charged. He wentSa his home and later
went out for a walk. He has not been
seen since.

The Chronicle In reference to the fore
going: says: "During the past fifteen
months a new republic, known by the
name of Acre, has sprung up in the forest
country lying partly in Brazil and partly
In Bolivia. It has been established by a
rich Brazilian banker and rubber dealer
named Arch, who has set himself up as
President over a community of about 20,
000 people, all of whom are In his employ.
Demonstrations have been' made against 1
the little country by both Brazil and Bo
livia."
"Arleopolls," said Mr. Phillips, "is the
capital city of the republic of Acre, the
'Forest Republic' we like to call it by way
of variation, and some call us the Rub
ber Republic. I dare, say the nationality
is not widely known, being new, and to
secure formal recognition on the part of
the United States is my mission. I be
lieve this is the first time that Arleopolls
has been written on any American hotel
register, for I did not stop at San Fran
cisco on my arrival from South America,
being In a hurry to be at Washington be
fore the opening of Congress."

in the Maple room of the Palace
Hotel by the ladles who composed
the board of directors of the San
Francisco Nursery for Homeless
Children was a grand success.
Soon after 2 o'clock the spacious hall
was thronged by prominent society peo
ple, the ladies exquisitely gowned, who
visited the booths one after another and
spent their money most liberally In aid of
the good cause. The ladles who had
charge of the different booths took a
breathing spell j socn after 5, but at 8
o'clock the doors were thrown open again
and the levee was literally jammed until
long after midnight. Every article was
told at a good figure, and the manage
ment, which worked for several weeks. Is
to be congratulated upon the splendid re
sults of the affair.
On entering the Maple room the first
booth to attract the eye was the fancy
work booth, presided over by Mrs. R. H.
Countryman. Everything* conceivable in
the fancy work line was offered for sale.
Handsome sofa pillows, dainty linens, pin
cushions, and, dear to every bachelor,
large laundry bags that were guaranteed
not to tear to pieces the first time used.
Mrs. Countryman was' ably assisted by
Mrs. George Warren, Mrs. Gadds, Mrs,
E. Mills and Mrs. Gould. In the evening
Messr6, C. Feusier, Russell Osborn, F. J.
Schuyler, Ed Mills and R. H. Country
man assisted the ladles by running a race
course that helped swell the finances.
Mrs. Hollis and Mrs. Bertz presided over
an api on booth and did a rushing busi
ness. A touching incident occurred in con
nection with this booth. Early in the day
a middle-aged man called at the Maple
room and stated that he had seen in the
papers that the ladies were trying to raise
funds for the orphan children; that he
was when quite young an orphan himself;
that he had been brought up in a charita
ble institution, and that he would like to
help the present movement. He left sev
eral hundred copies of the latest sheet
music which he desired to be sold, the pro
ceeds to jo toward the nursery. The
music waf taken in hand by Miss Bertz
and sold by her. It netted quite a sum.
A splendid feature of the le%-ee was a
doll booth, presided over by Mrs. W. S.
Leake. Every conceivable style of doll
was represented, and they were displayed
in such good taste that the booth p're
sented a very* chic appearance. The doll
booth seemed to strike a popular fancy,
as it was the rendezvous of all buyers,
and business was so brisk and Mrs. Leake
had so many friends call to see her that
at 5 o'clock every doll had been sold. A
few dolls, especially Madame Frou-Frou
donated by Mrs. Phil Kohn, were still
kept on exhibition so as not to spoil the
appearance of the booth. Madame Frou
Frou was subsequently raffled and won by
Mrs. Al Walterstein. The latter lady pre
sented the beautiful doll to the nursery.
The doll Floradora was won by Mrs. Henry
Hale Fuller, the lucky number being 75.
The ladies who assisted In this booth are
Miss Georgia Speiker, Miss Bessie Gowan.
Miss Mamie C. Barrett, Miss Florence
Dresbach, Mrs. Eleanor Humphreys and
w> Ar neill. A hit in this booth was
"The Old Woman Who Lived In a Shoe,"
Icecream and lemonade were served in
another room under the direction of Mrs.
A. H. Martin and Mrs. "Albert Dernham.
The tables were prettily decorated with
white roses. The ladles who assisted in
this share of the work were Mrs. G. F.
Kenny, Mrs. C. P. Lincoln, Miss Edna
Frank and Miss Florence Martin. Mrs.
J. B. Elder was hard at work on the floor
raffling off a taJlor*made gown that had
been donated by a local tailor.
During the afternoon selections were
rendered by a selected orchestra, and
Master Harold Borchers, a little boy of
only four years, Cid a cakewalk spe-
The grab bag was well looked after by
Mrs. C. Mason, and Miss N. Preston was
busy all the afternoon and evening; telling
the good people their fortunes. Mrs. W .
Jackson started in opposition and also did
a very lucrative business in telling for
tunes by cards.
The candy booth was a great success
and was stocked with every style of
candy that had been made under the per
sonal supervision of Mrs. S. B.*-McX<ene
gan. She was assisted by Mrs. Manning,
Miss Osborn and Miss Breese.
who was represented by a little girl from
the nursery. - - . .
_ The art booth was In the able hands of
Airs. K. F. Pieston. She was assisted by
Miss Pre.ston, Mrs. William Thomas and
Miss Thomas. The booth was stocked
with handsome bric-a-brac of every de
scriptionâantique brass candlesticks, cut
glass bowls, candle shades in all colors
ana pretty water color etchings.
The flo'wer booth enhanced the beauty
of the room and was artistically arranged
by Mrs. Frank B. Wright, who had
charge. There were big bunches of vio
lets, fine specimens- of carnations and
choice pots of palms and ferns. The as
slsta.nts in the tlower booth were Miss W.
Wright. Miss Wells and Miss Alfreda

.Whether a utility Ii to be purchased out of
the funds raised by general tax levy or is to
DÂ« paid for by an issuance of bonds, the ques-
, of *'fl uj sltlon must be submitted to the
people before any such purchase can be made.
The only expenditures which the charter con
templates, prior to the actual construction or
purchase, are those Incident to the making- of
plans and estimates and the holdlny of the
election at which the popular will is taken
There is no provision which, under the most
liberal construction, would Justify any expendi
ture for an option; none which seems to regard
such an expenditure as a possibility.
It Is proposed to pay for such option out of
the urgent necessity fund. The right to pur-
Chase a property five or ten years hence Is
hardly to be regarded seriously as an urgent
necessity.
Aside from all question of power there Is this
danger to be regarded In such a transaction
the city might be estopped from taking- such
action as It may hereafter deem necessary con
cerning ttgt franchise rights of this company
by reason of having entered Into an agreement
to purchase the same.
If the board desires to submit to thÂ« peop'Â«
of San Francisco the Question of public owner
ship of a telephone system, the prooedur* re
quired by the charter Is (1) that plans and es
timates of cost shall be procured, and (J) offer*
called for from the existing 1 telephone compan

the city, and â¢ <8> that an election . be held at

City Attorney Lane filed an opinion with

TKE EXASPERATING WOMAN
We All Know Har and Feel Sorry
for Herâ What Makes Her So,
and Who Is to Blame.'
A woman of prominence gives advice
In a recent article to a man who com-
plains of an exasperating wife. It
seems the wife, according to the hus-
band, Is principally remarkable for
what Ehe is not, but has also some
marked development of energy; she
makes a specialty of misplacing the
soap, and Is careless about tooth
brushes; she also takes upon herself to
do the work for which servants are
provided. This woman was also ad-
dicted to the torn wrapper, and un-
kempt hair habits, and In general left
conspicuously undone the things that
needed doing. When remonstrated
with she reminds her husband that they
possess mischievous children, and calls
him unreasonable and a faultfinder.
The first suggestion in the article was
a plain Inference that the most effective
way to bring peace and order Into the
family would be with an axe. The prej-
udice against violence having an unfor-
tunate method of reacting â¢with un-
pleasant results, the puzzled husband is
advised "to have a serious talk with his
wife, or better still, since such women
will never listen to sense." to write her
a clear and kindly statement of things,
and failing Improvement to practically
desert her fcr his club.
Of course such "advice" Is absurd,
and would surely make matters worse.
This woman is exasperating because
Bhe is not in a proper state_yt bodily
and mental health, and musty be ex-
pected by her husband, and by every-
body, to be exasperating and erratic.
The first thing to do for that woman
Is to build up her health, and in no
other way can any good thing be ac-
complished. The man himself is unrea-
sonable as most men are. He loses sight
of the fact that his -wife is in ill-health,
and Instead of making strenuous efforts
to improve her physical and mental
condition, he Is critical and cold.
"We all know this type of woman and
sympathize with her deeply. She is
making mistakes nil the time that are
ruining her* life, but is not conscious of
them because her mental condition is
warped. I want to say to this woman
that she must not expect ill-health and
troublesome children to excuse her
from efficiency as a wife and mother.
However unjust it may be. and it is
brutally so, the woman who leads a
happy life must be one for whom "al-
lowances" do not have to be made.
When a woman begins to think she
!s ill-used her whole manner shows
that she carries a grievance around
with her. and unless she comes to her
senses the end of that woman Is dis-
tinct failure. I wish with all the
strength of my being that I could make
women understand how vitally impor-
tant, to them, to their children and to
their husbands, is attention to their
own health.
By health I don't mean acute things
like colds and feversâ I mean the fe-
male complaints that so many women
are troubled with, and which in every
case have their effect upon the view a
woman takes of her duty, upon her
mental attitude toward the household,
and upon her own physical appearance.
I have a gTeat sympathy for women
who become fretful, and incapable, and
exasperating through some feminine
trouble, because they don't half realize
their condition or its causes, and it isn't
until the real poetry has gone out of
their lives, and nothing but humdrum
hopelessness is left that they can see
where their misery originated.
The very safest way to do for women
who have myFterious aches and pains
Is to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, for this medicine has
never hurt anybody, and it has really
done lots of good to a great number of
women. You take, for Instance, a
young- woman whose entry upon the
Incidents peculiar to womanhood is ac-
companied by unusual features, ten
chances to one this young woman won't
do a thing to help herself, or no one she
knoxrs may know how to help her. or
Fhe can't gret efficient help from the
family doctor to whom ehe dislikes to
talk about herselfâ what happens? "Why
this girl goes along, has a great variety
cf pains which she struggles with the
best she canâ by and by ehe gets mar-
ried, has children, some female trouble
develops, she gets thin, and querulous,
and discouraged, and becomes presently
the exasperating woman who can't live
peaceably with any one no matter how
amiable the other person or persons.
Give us more Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound and fewer exas-
perating, discouraged, sickly women.
This medicine I solemnly think would
make a stronger generation of women
If every woman who needed It would
take it. I never look upon a woman's
face prematurely drawn without want-
Ing to urge the use of airs. Pinkham'a
medicine.
Ot course women -who have some fe-
male trouble won't listen to reason until
they are compelled to, but if they only
â¢would use ordinary common sense
about taking care of themselves at the
beginning, complaints about the exas-
perating woman would materially
lessen. HELEN MARVIN.

The desperate , encounter . between Tax
Collector Scott and Jack McNamara.Mn
which the official narrowly escaped death,
was the topic of .absorbing comment In
the city yesterday. Tax Collector Scott
had recovered from the shock of hl3 expe
rience and was at his desk as usual yes
terday. He did not care to discuss the
matter and expressed the hope that'll
would be allowed to drop as it is.
Scott -' considers himself fortunate in
having escaped alive, and it is safe to say
that he will not in a hurry make himself
tho champion of the virtues of Martin
Kelly or anybody else. ?
says .that he- will not prosecute
McKamara, -and unless application Is
made for â¢ a warrant by him the police
would not be justified in taking any meas

done In the matter.

James A. Delahay, formerly a clerk at

and charged with forgery. Some time ago
Delahay met a young woman named I/na
Nonneman, who Is employed as a do

a lodging-house at Eddy and Hyd3
Btreets, and proceeded to make violent
love to her. He represented that he had
just arrived from the East and that he
had "money to burn." The foolish woman,
after listening to bis burning wordi.of
love and his stories of successes In xpe
East, became madly infatuated with him
and agreed to become his wife.
Becoming financially embarrassed Dela
hay conceived the bold scheme of using
his unsuspecting victim as a "tool" to
get money for him. Giving - tÂ«er two
checks, one for |20 and the other for $25,
which purported to have been signed by
Gavin McNab and Receiving Teller Amos
of the Hlbernla Bank, he a<sked the girl

The bark R. P. Rlthet had a lively time
of it on her last trip from Honolulu. First
of all, she struck a dead calm and nearly
went ashore before getting away from the
island of Oahu. Then she was caught in
a heavy southeaster and lost several sails.
Then she was almost on top of tho North
F&railones before the captain got his po
sition, and finally she nearly ran down the
lightship buoy when making port.
"It was the most eventful voyage I ever
made," said the second mate yesterday.
"Had our anchors not held we would have
gone ashore on Oahu and had they not
held again we would have gone on the
North Farallones. It was a case of touch
and go all around, but luckily we pulled
through."
The Kithet is now loading for Honolulu
for Welch & Co.
MANY NEW VESSELS BUILDING.
Five Wind- Jammers Soon to Be Added
to the Coast Fleet.
At least five new vessels will Join the
coast fleet r.ext spring. Hind, Kolph &
Co. have found it necessary to get more
carriers and ln consequence nave made
contracts with all the well known ship
builders for new vessels. A barkentine to
be called Lahaina is being built at Boole's
ln Oakland Creek; a barKcntine (a dupli
cate of ihÂ»i William Carson) to be called
the Kohala is building \at Bendlxsen's; a
four-ir.asted t-chooner fs being built at
Hay & Wright's, and the schooner Mahu
kona is being built at Grays Harbor.' All
of these vessels will carry a million feet
of lumber and over, and every one of
them trill be fitted out in first class style.
The contracts for these vessels were let
nearly a year ago, but it is only now that
the builders can get to work on them. Be
cause of the rush Hind, Rolph & Co. had
to go to England to get a barkentine built
and the Hawaii is now on her way to
Honolulu from Glasgow in consequence.
Besides these new boats the firm has pur
chased the Henry Villard in the East, and

VERY NARROW ESCAPES
Judgment Rendered
. in Ten. ,
; ... Â¦
, Judges Cook and Dunne sat in bank yes
terday in Judge Cpok's court to hear argu
ments of counsel in the appeal cases of
the poolsellers convicted of and sentenced
for violating the ordinance against pool
selling. Attorney Joseph' Coffey . repre
sented the prosecution and Attorney
George D. Collins the defendants.
The. first case heard was that of Joseph
Peckerman, clerk for Zick ' Abrams, who
was convicted by a Jury in' Judge Con
lan's court and sentenced to pay a fine of
J250. At the trial in the lower court the
jury had been impaneled and sworn and
next morning when the case was to be
heard the. prosecution asked that permis
sion te granted to re-examine one of the
jurors, wmch was objected to by Attorney
Collins. The Judge granted the request,
and tne'juior, N. A. Judd of me iiicks
judd Printing Company, was examined
as to his connection with poolsellers by
reason of doing printing for them. The
juior was challenged by the prosecution
and the challenge was allowea. The ap
peal was take'n on the ground that tne
Judge erred in allowing , the challenge.
The appellate court decided that the ap
peal was well taken. The. prosecution,
asked for a new trial, but it was refused
and the case dismissed.
Tho second case was that of D. J. Crow
ley, who was convicted by a jury in Judge
Cabaniss' court and fined 5300. An appeal
was taken on the ground that three of the
Jurorsâ Julius Haug, J. H. Blakeway and
C. J. Collinsâ were allowed to try the case
by the court when they were disqualified
by reaton of actual bias, and on tho other
ground that the complaint did not show
that the pool was sold on- a "system of
registering bets as wagers," as required
by the ordinance. The appeal was sus
tained, a motion for a new trial was re
fused and tho case dismissed.
There was no time to hear the argu
ments on the three test cases of Harry
Corbett, Joseph Mohan and John Rlley.
which were tried by Judge Mogan without
a jury by agreement between the pool
sellers and Chief Sullivan, so as to decldÂ»
what constitutes a pool. Counsel will sub
mit briefs in these cases within three days
and a decision will be rendered within ten
days.
Judgo Cook remarked that the decisions
ln the Peckerman and Crowley cases did
not enter Into the merits of the points ln
dispute between the prosecution and de
fense which were em.braced in the three
test cases ln which briefs were to be sub
mitted.
Briefs Will Be Submitted on Test
Cases Within Three Days and
Cases of Joseph reckerman
and D. J. Crowley Dis

ADVEHTISEMENTS.
The Bay' City Wheelmen held a "heart
party" at Its clubrooms last night, which
drew a Iar*e crowd. ,
Bay City Wheelmen Party.
How Do You Like This New Fad?
Vegetarians, anti-coffee drinkers and
food cranks -of Â¦ every description must;
now take a back seat, for a new fad has
the floor.
A society has recently been formed, the
members of which pledge themselves to
eat no food whatever that has been cook-
ed. They claim that uncooked food Is the
only rational healthful diet: that our re-
mote ancestors ate no cooked food and
therefore if we do the same vigor and
health will be our reward.
Raw meat, raw potatoes, raw wheat,
raw egps, raw everything, is the enticing
bill of fare held: out to the enthusiastic
food crank of the future, and the society-
proposes to establish restaurants in the
larger cities where this delightful menu
may be served dally..
Modern cooking is often a. dyspepsia
producer, because we fry so many foods
which should be baked, roasted, broiled
or boiled; fried food is indigestible- be-
cause each particle of food is Incased in
hot grease, which, the digestive juices of
the stomach cannot easily penetrate; but
properly cooked , food Is more easily, di-
gested than the same food. uncooked, and
we predict for the. new fad a very, limited
following. . , , ; . Â¦ - Â¦
/The real cause of indigestion is the lack
of Hydrochloric acid aud peptones In the
stomach;- so- that; no matter 'how- well
cooked the food it cannot be well digested-
unless the gastric, juice < is. abundant ; and
contains the necessary- amount of pep-
tones to dissolve the food." ..y Â¦; .
i Therefore the most sensible : cure for
poor: digestion is "..to take alter each meal
some safe and reliable-digestive like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which supply
peptones to digest the; meat and eggs and
diastase to digest the v bread, potatoes and
similar starchy foods. \ ....- j ,-.
Laxative medicines. never cure indiges-
tion, because they have no digestive effect
whatever upon the food; on the other
hand, if .the food Is * properly digested
there will be no need, of laxatives. Good
digestion does away .with constipation,
v,"; Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain pure
aseptic pepsin (government test) diastase
and' the digestive elements which weak
stomachs lack, \ and they cure indigestion
by assisting the overworked, 1 rundown sto-
mach in its hard work until it Is restored
to ; its , normal condition, whehvthe ; tablets
'are no longer needed;; but there are thou-
â¢sands^of robusti men, and' women \ who
never. eat a meal* without'- taking one or
two of Stuart's . Tablets, - because by so
doing they- can eat; what they -please and
-when they.Â«plÂ©ase , and ; be free â¢ from any
bad after-effects, v "Â¦' Â¦ * '-'"- X-\i?J ' :^**.,
-- Stuart's â¢" Dyspepsia Tablets are ; Bold by
druggists - everywhere - . Â¦ ln * the >. United
States. Canada and' Great Britain

STOCKMAN'S FINGERS
Same on Both. Sands.
W. E. Beckham, a corking heavy-weight
of Burton, Kar.s.. Is ln the livestock busi-
ness. He did net need to pay much at-
tention to the food he ate until about two
years ago an attack of the grip left him
partially paralyzed. His experience with
Is well worth reading.
â¢The third and little finger on each
hand became partially paralyzed, and my
spine was affected just below the back of
the neck. This came from a severe at-
tack of the? grip two years ago. I almost
entirely lost the use of my hands.
"This condition continued eeveral
months, in spite of all kinds of baths and
treatments. In the meantime my stom-
ach, bowels and digestive organs became
affected and deranged. My liver seemed
to have no more action than if I had no
Bvfr at all. No food of any kind tasted
tight, and I run <Sowa from 210 pounds
to ICO.
"One day the gTOceryman asked me If
I had ever tried Grape-Nuts food. He
told me that It was recommended as a
brain end nerve food and that It was pre-
digeated.
"So I commenced the use of Grape-
Nutp and carried some in my pocket.
>.'oÂ»v and then wlvn I feit hungry would
lake som* of the food into m> mouth and
alicw it to melt ti-fore swallowing. The
food has a dfUclou* taste and I bepan to
;m;Â»rove right awa>. In three days' time
I teak very much better.
"i continued the use of Grape-Nuts and
continued to improve steadily. In a few
weeks longer 1 was strong and had re-
frained the use cf my har.ds j>erfectly. In
iess than five months I was back to over
200 pounds, as you see mÂ«Â» in the picture
which 1 send. Am row 51 years o!d and
mrver bad better health In all my life. I
Tasted a firÂ«t-cla?s medical examination
it bout fuur months ago la a life Insurance
eorepauy.
"My recovery to good "health is solely
duo to the use of <J rape-Nuts food. As
a brain and nerve food there Is nothing,
equal to It. You can use any part of this
letter, and I hope it may lead some un-
fortunate Invalid to health."

In a later letter, evidently sent in reply
to one received from Mantel, the writer
disclosed her identity, signing it Evelyn
Cuthbert. but declined to give up her pic
ture until such time as Mantel could take
a trip for the purpose : of seeing her
charms in person.
Papa Cuthbert. who Is employed as a
printer on the Sacramento Record Union,
was informed by his daughter regarding
the correspondence, and possibly did not
approve of it. for the young lady, antici
pating the visit of Mantel, wrote him as
follows:
12 Capp ave., Fruitvale. Alameda. County.
Dear Mr. Mantel â My father waa down to-day
and I told him of our correspondence, but did
net tell him how our acquaintance began. . I
Fhowed him your photo and he liked your
looks very much and has no objection to our
continued friendship as long as he hears noth
ing against you. I feel very sure if he knew
how we really had become acquainted he would
not for one moment allow this to continue :' w>
if at any time you should write to hlnf do not
on any account let the fecret out. On making
inquiries about you I told him that I hail
known" you for about six weeks, so he Imagined
from that you were up here at that time and
(sion. I have received your two Interesting, let
ters and have been waiting for my photos be-
detectives on her track and have learned
enough to permit me to recover.
"I believe if . my^ wife was left "alone
that we could get on all right, but. now I
am going to push the matter through -the
courts, and even have her arrested if I- do
not get my presents and money back."
THINZS MANTEL IS CRAZY.
Wife of the Mexican Brewer Tells
Why She Left Him.
-.OAKLAND, Nov. 24â Mrs. Evelyn Man
tel lives with a friend at 14 Capp avenue,
in Fruitvale. She is a daughter of W. W.
Cuthbert, foreman in the office of the
Sacramento Record-Union. She preferred
that her attorney should do any talking
that was necessary in regard to her diffi
culties with her husband, but would say
that she did not consider him wholly re
sponsible for his recent acts.
"He is certainly not in his right mind,"
said Mrs. Mantel. "He has threatened a
great many times to publish what in his
erratic mind he considers breaches of pro

a large brewery 4 ln Chihuahua, Mexico,
and I" spent' some time there with him,
returning about a year ago. Owing to his
spiteful actions he and I did not get along
well together. We separated and I have
jiot seen him now for some time. I saw
him last ten days ago and I thought from
the way he talked that he had about given
up his insane idea of wanting to publish
our troubles, but It seems he has not."
Asa V. Mendehall, attorney for Mrs.
Mantel, said' to-night:
"Mantel treated his wife in a very cruel
and unusual manner, and we can only ac
count for his actions upon the theory that
he is crazy.- Mrs. Mantel was compelled
to leave him because of his treatment and
is now staying with friends tn Fruitvale.
It Is only necessary to tell of his treat
ment of his wife In one particular to show
his actions. Miss Maxwell, at whose home
she is now staying, had been visiting her
at her home and Mrs. Mantel decided to
return with her to visit her father.
"Mantel had the police at every town
they passed through stop them and search
their effects and put them to every Incon
venience possible. Mr. Cuthbert, Mrs. Man
tel's father, sent them some money bv
check, which they tried to have cashed at
El Paso, only to find that Mantel had or
dered all banks not to pay any checks to
his wife. This caused more delay and
annoyance. His treatment of her has
been the same in all cases and she has
been subjected to the most humiliating
annoyances.'.' â¢;':,'â¢:;;

Letters equally as tender, but Increasing
In intensity of endearing expressions fol
lowed. Business permitted Mantel to
come, to San Francisco. With personal
intercourse the spark of love was fanned
.into a flame ami Evelyn Cuthbert waa
married to Mantel at the residence of
Mrs. Maxwell, in Fruitvale, in the after
noon of January 31. 18S9, Rev. R. F. Coyle
of Oakland officiating.
No reception or honeymoon followed the
marriage ceremony. On the Southern Pa
cific train, which left Oakland two hours
later, the bride bade a hasty adieu to her
husband, promising to meet him soon again
in Mexico, when they would assume the
duties of husband and wife in a hacienda
in Chihuahua. Every month. Mantel says,
he sent his wife $25 for her maintenance,
but it was destined tnat nearly a year
should elapse before they should again
be united. In the meanwhile all kinds of
endearlnir letters passed between them.
Finally tired of waiting, in November.
1R90. Mantel says he sent his wife $100 with
which to make the journey to Mexico,
and about midnight of November 17 the
. bride . arrived . at Chihuahua In company
with a relative. Katherlne Maxwell.
The very next morning Mrs. Mantel, ac
cording to her husband, declared that she
wanted to go home to her mother, and al
though Mantel gave her $40 to purchase
necessaries for their household she would
not stay, and after a wrangle lasting two
days Mrs. Mantel and Katherine Maxwell
returned to this country.
While Mrs. Mantel was In Chihuahua a
letter from one Charles Lund of Fruit
vale addressed to Mrs. Mantel was re
ceived and opened by her husband.- There
is nothing apparently in the letter to ex
cite suspicion, but Mantel says he did not
like her to receive it. Now Mantel Is here
to seek redress.
"I commenced corresponding with my
wife three years ago." said Mantel, "and
when I first met. her I did not like her. I
thought she had too Tiueh temper,' but
Mrs. Maxwell insisted she would
make a grood wife 'j and I married
her. The same afternoon, two hours
later, I was on my wiiy to Mexico. "We

Behind this change is a tale of intrigue
BURGLAR MAKES
HIMSELF FELT
Working the Western Addi
tion'in the Guise of
a Peddler.
Ji. number of daylight burglaries in the
"U'estern Addition have recently been re
ported to the police and they are satisfied
the work Is that of an ex-convict for
whom they are looking.
One of the most daring of the lot oc
curred last Wediiesdav between -12 and 1
o'clock at the residence of Mrs. George
Steckelberg, a widow at 1500 Jackson
street. .Every one happened to be out of
the house between those hours and one
of the neighbors observed a man ring
the front door bell. The man waited for
a minute or two and then entered the
house, the neighbor thinking that some
one had opened the door to admit him.
He was seen to leave in a few minutes
in a hurry. Â¦ . ' : '
Mrs. Steckelberg returned shortly after
1 o'clock and she 1 at once saw that there
had been a visitor during- her absence.
She hurried to her .bedroom and discov
ered that her Jewel case had disappeared.
The room had been thoroughly ransacked
and jewelry consisting of diamond rings/
bracelets and other articles" valued-/. at
about' $1000 had been stolen.
Mrs. Steckolberg at once notified police
headquarters, and Detective. Ross "Whit
taker was detailed on the case. He made
an investigation and came to the conclu
sion that the * burglar had effected an
entrance through the front door by means
of a skeleton key. He got a description of
the man who was seen ringing- the front
bell and- decided that he was the 5 ex-con
,vict the police have been looking for/
Every effort has been made to find him,
but so far without success. .
It Is supposed. that the burglar is the
man who goes around pretending that he
Is a peddler. He watches his oppor
tunity when he sees people leaving a
house and makes the- way clear by ring
ing the door bell. - If -it is" answered- he
asks if anything in the shape of fruit or
vegetables is wanted, and If not -an
swered he takes the chance of no one
being at home. Â¦' - ; '

Members of the company tell of many
disputes in which Marion took up the
cudgels in Miss Benner's defense when
that sweet warbler was threatened with
fines. The last time was in this rlty
when some one In front of the house fined
the young actress $10 for interpolating

Miss Benner objected to 'paying the
money, claiming that Marion, who is
stage manager, had told her to put the
business in.' Then, as the business de
partment showed no signs of yielding, she
went to Marion, the all-powerful, with
her tale of woe. The comedian sought
the front of the house and the companv
tells of an angry colloquy which ended

Mexico, has journeyed all the
way from the Southern republic
to straighten out a matrimonial
tangle into which he got himself
about two years ago and incidentally
take rev.enge on his mother-in-law and
Bister-in-law, whom he Is about to sue
for alienating .his wife's affections. Be
sides, he demands the- return of his pres
ents and money advanced for the support
of the wife who practically deserted him,
he Bays, on their wedding day.
Mantel is a traveling salesman for the
Chihuahua Brewing. Company and occa
sionally makes visits to this coast. . On
one of these occasions, about three years
ago, his attention was attracted to an ad
vertisement In a morning paper for a po
sition as governess, housekeeper or some
thing of this kind, signed "M. B:," Fruit
vale, Cal. Mantel answered the advertise
ment and a long correspondence followed.
One of the earliest letters received by
Mantel, hut without date, is as follows:

The supper room at the Palace, which
was opened for its second season two
weeks ago. has contributed in no small
degree to the entertainment and conven
ience of those who have attended the
opera, and who enjoy refreshments at the
close of an evening spent at the theater.
The service is identical with that which
has made the grill rooms famous, and the
concerts each evening- are worthy of spe
cial mention. Theater-jjoers do not hesi
tate to show their appreciation of the
efforts made to provide for their com
fort, for the patronage has reached such
proportions that it has been found neces
sary to operate the ladies' grill. In con
junction, with the supper room. And this
is as It should be, for no institution
in Ban Francisco has done more to min
ister to the comfort of patrons than the

COMMISSION IN NATIONAL GUARD
Adjutant of First Regiment Will
Retire to Private Life-
; p^yy^HE question that is now agitating
I the -members of the National
I Guard in this city Is what kind ol
1L a defense Captain Nippert of Com
pany F, First Infantry, will make
! to the charge of having made a false pa
rade report. It is said that he will plead
i In extenuation of his action precedent in
the First Regiment of Infantry, and he
has expressed the belief that he has not
been guilty of anything wrong. If the
chexge that has been preferred against
him by Major Margo is sustained by the
j court-martial there Is no alternative pun
! ishment; it Is dishonorable discharge from
: the service of the State.
The captain was given an opportunity
to resign from the command of his com
pany before the charges were preferred,
, but ho declined to act upon the sugges
tion. It was generally understood that
Major Charles L. Tilden was to appear as
counsel for the accused, but the major
asserts that he Is not and will not be in
the case.
Captain Alfred J. Kelleher, adjutant of
the First Regiment, has tendered his res
ignation, which will take effect about the
time that Colonel O'Nell assumes com
mand of the regiment. The captain en
tered the National Guard as a private In

the wonders of California.
The Mariposa, though not so speedy as the steamships which will
follow her, is expected to make the trip on schedule time, and on her
return will drop out and leave the service to the Sierra, Sonoma and
Ventura. The first named, which was delayed In. leaving Philadel

on Wednesday, December 12, and will be followed by the Sonoma and

convenient mail and passenger service to those far off lands, as well
as an Increase In the business of San Francisco. Before the inaugu

to Auckland in twenty-one days and to Sydney in twenty-five days.
In point of time this linecould not compete with the Peninsular

In our present state.
If there be no final consequences in koepirs
with the character attained here - thin th >
moral government of Cod Is an annmah in thÂ»
whole realm of the universe-. For the t-ach
lngs of religion concerning future punMhment
we find analogies in natural punishments,
many cf which are final to him who incurs
them. Show me one well deflned analogy irÂ»

to serious consideration. Ridicule will not re
move thÂ» dreadful facts nor thÂ» pertinent
analogies which confront us.
The necessity cf a deterrent from violations
of law Is universally recosrnized In every realm
of government. The presence of pains ami
penalties as well as of rewards is present
everywhere, unless. Indeed, tho value of moral

We see this In the government of families and

Nothing Is so much needed as a clear, un

of an awful realization of tho danger of thcsÂ«
about us. presented in iomÂ» of its phases for
the remainder of this year by every rabbi, every
priest, rector, pastor and mission worker woultl

reformation has come elsewhere or will eomo

viction concernlnj the awful realities of thÂ« .
future. And he who lives for the future most
sincerely lives best in the present.
And that which is so essential to best con
dition of life cannot be false In philosophy.
Among those who were seen yesterday
and who stand for the orthodox belief la
hell Is the Rev. r>r. John A. B. "Wlnalow.
In an interview he spoke a3 follows:
The instinct of immortality is indelibly
stamped upon every life and upr.n every race.
If we are to live somewhere forever th.i con
ditions upon which we enter upon that estate
Is the paramount question of present existence.
It is very convenient and eminently sat
isfactory for men of the world, the dis
putants declare, to brush hell away lis
ridicule, but reason as well as faith im
pels us to a conviction that after death
there must be the reward of good acts
and the punishment of evil ones. Hell 19

and it cannot be annihilated In a meta

suffering as the consequence of crime.
Rabbi Nieto's sermon denouncing dog-.
matlc religion and pleading for rational

to be supreme has created a storm of
comment. When the young clergyman
declared that "hell's a painted farce" hÂ«
brought the defenders of <*>grmatl3tn la
every faith to their feet. In a series ot

The second half was a killing one for
Captain Daly's men. and It was not long
before they began to give way before the
unprecedented onslaughts of the Yale
men. Burnett had succeeded Lee Just be
fore the first half ended. Shortly after
the kick-off of the second half the crim
son supporters were thrown into a. panic
when Daly, who had been limping, went
back to the side lines and. Harvard had
lost her captain.
In rapid succession Harvard s men were
grilled out of the game. The crimson
team played twenty men. The only Yale
man to leave was Olcott. the center, who,
five minutes before the game was ended,
sustained a blow on the head and Holt
took his place. The scoring of the
second half was of the spectacular order.

With a lead of one point Lowell played
with greater spirit, while the. Berkeley
boys' became desperate. At one time they
bucked their way thirty-five yards, only
to lose the ball on offside play; Neither
team could make ground because of the
strength of their linemen and they re
eorted to kicking. Pratt and Volz in the
back, field handled punts nicely. McQues
tlon, left end for Berkeley, played' a fine
game, as did also Prentice, who went In in
the second half. Keegan broke through
repeatedly. KIdtl did the same and
blocked a kick. Rooney tripped over his
own interference and did not make his
distance. Seltzer was a little flat at the
outset of the ?ame, but after being shaken
up he played with more spirit. Vo'.z was
The piaying was fast and intensely in

resorted to so often by both elevens that
the ends were continually racing down
the field. A field goal by Volz and some
spectacular tackling by Kooney and Mc-
Question created enthusiasm In the tirs;
half. Vote had the wind in his favor and
kicked with precision and preat force.
Pratt was outpunttd in this naif, but in
tbfe last half he not only equaled his
clever rival but surpassed nim a number
of times. Volz's field goal was a' pretty
effort.' McCoy passed the ball very poorly
to him, but the young fellow, unmindful
of the players breaking through on him,
bounced the ball to the ground and as it
arose pent it Hying over the bar.
Lowell was disheartened when the first
half ended, but determined to fight to the
last. Profiting by the trick taught them
by Coach Yost, they won the game and
championship. It was a delayed pass.
Vps Burgh gave. the signal and. like a
flash handed the ball to Pratt. The latter
charged on tenter backward- and as h'e
bluffed to go through he handed the bait
back to Vqs Burgh, who shot inÂ°lde~a
hole .between right tackle and end and
made a touchdown
that may cause the selection of two other
teams of the leag-uÂ« to contest for the
cup. Three aays ottore yesterday's game
Hc-rkeley and Lowell seceded rrom the
league oecause the members of the two
teams that were to play the linal game
of the Academic League series were not
given a sufficient number of compliment
ary tickets. An ettcrt was nvide to settle
the matter amicably, but the hot-headed
youngsters were obdurate. Both teams
agreed to play the linal game, but under
their own auspices. They engaged tne
grounds at Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
l educed the price of admission 'to te> cents
and ignored ihe league management.
1 he outcome of yesterday *Â» game was
not certain until the whistle blew the sig
nal to cease hostilities. Both elevens
were evenly matched. There was little to
choose between them In point of knowledge
of the game.. Both teams had during the
past, month met and defeated splendid
amateur aggregations and each was con-
Jldent of its strength and ability to beat
the other.
SIDE LIGHTS ON THE GAME FOR
i THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE ACA
DEMIC LEAGUE.
WHEN Volz, fullback of the
Berkeley High School team
netted five points for his team
by drop-kicking a' goal from
the' field the wearers of the
yellov; and red, who occupied a large sec
tion of the grand stand at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets yesterday, shouted their
Joy in strident tones. But' when a youth
named Vos Burgh, Lowell's star quarter
back, on a delayed pass tucked the pig
skin under his arm and raced for the goal
with the whole Berkeley team In his wake
the wearers ot the red and white danced
and hugged one another and shouted until
the policemen on duty thought a small
sized riot had broken ,out. The fifteen
hundred spectators watched Vos Burgh
proudly carry the oval out to the 20-yard
line and as the ball was balanced' to a
nicety by one of his teammates poise his
foot for a moment, sending the leather
a-swish'ng over the goal posts. Six poin'ts
were scored for his school. Another great
shout went up and another Indian war
dance was executed by the local high
school rooters. Scoreâ Lowell 6, Berke
ley 5.
It was by this narrow margin that Low
ell won the championship of the Academic
Athletic League. Only one point sepa
rated the rivals, but that one point was
as priceless as the beautiful silver trophy
donated by Clabrough & Golcher, which
the victors hope to receive from the
league. It may be a vain hope, however,
as the Academic League managers have
been quietly suffering from an affront

CLEVER NARCISSUS IS
THE STAKE FAVORITE
The new lot of hares at Union Park
proved a bit faster than expected and aa
a result relief dogs were called on sev
eral times during the stake to finish some
hard courses.
Master Rocket, In his course with War
rigo, gave the form players a scare.
Selling a strong favorite at 10 to 1 tha
best Deckelman's dos: could do was to
break even on points with his opponent.
When the dogs came up for the run-oC
Rocket's stock dropped quite a few points,
going to 4. "With a show of speed Rocket
was Inclined to lay oft and let Warrlgo
do the" work. The blÂ£ end bettors were
about to give up hope of landing when the
red flag went up with Rocket one point
to the good.
The upset of the day wa3 the defeat of
Warship by Golden Garter, an 8 to 1
short-ender.
The youngster King Cashier beat Spite

The position of umpire, however, has

criticized in his rulings by the Stanford

lenient in not penalizing for obvious hold

was of a highly honest and earnest order,

REFEREE, BUT NO UMPIRE, SELECTED
FOR THE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME
The football authorities of California
and Stanford are finding It difficult to
agree upon an available man to act a3
umpire in the great Thanksgiving day
game.
Realizing the importance of securing
competent officials, the management of
each college commenced a month ago to
canvass the field and come to an agree
ment on experts. Local ex-players or
those living on. the Pacific Coast were
first considered. From the outset Wil
liam Goodwin, the old Yale athlete and
referee of several of the recent intercol
legiate matches, was practically settled
upon to act In that capacity again. His
work of following find awarding the ball
in the many close plays of the big game
had given eminent satisfaction to both the
men of the blue and gold and cardinal,
and consequently there was no opposition
to his selection.

CHAMPIONS BEAT DUDES IN A GAME
THAT IS CUT SHORT BY DARKNESS
Darkness put a quietua on the game
yesterday afternoon at Recreation
grounds in tho beginning of the eighth
inning. This and a home run by Eagan
when the bags svere crowded were the
two glittering sensations on a fieljj of
sable. The score at -the wind-up . read
Sacramento 6, Oakland 2.
The game went along like other gamesâ
a few hits, a few errors and a few stolen
bases until the darkness cut it off two
innings before its natural finish. When
the swatter from Sacramento repeated hla
home run performance the small crowd
awoke and shouted. This is the story of
it: Dennie went to first on four evil ones,
Devereaux singled and Sheehan was given
a base on balls. Then up to the plate
walked "Homer" Eagan and soon after
the ball mounted the : right field fence.
Four runs for Sacramento, enough to
win the game, although in the sixth
another two runs were added and the
score read 6-2.
Oakland made its runs in the second and
without rendering them soggy. The full
scores in the handicap follow:

ON THE PRESIDIO LINKS
Winnie O'Connor, one of the most cap
able riders on the far Eastern tracks,. is
due here Monday. ! It Is understood that
Prince Poniatowskl has first call on his
services. Winnie Is a "get there" sort
of youth, though frequently reprimanded
for rough riding tactics.
Bookmaker Joe Rose dropped In from
Chicago yesterday morning and took a
fling at the Tanforan game. A small
man stood no chance at all with Joe when
he Btarted out to get aboard Walken
fhaw, the hot one for tht last run.
Willie Sink, the owner of Formero, was
advised to try aluminum plates on his
horeo by Billy Cahlll, the plater and
owner of Rolling Boer. He did bo, and
the chestnut ran as If he needed toe
weights, knee boots and a galtlng pole
to steady him at the finish, .1 .
Among the Eastern arrivals yesterday
were Jockeys Harry Spencer and Xash
Turner. Turner comes out under en
gagement to the Illinois turfman, Tom
Ryan, but unfortunately for Spencer, tho
lanky rider some weeks ago had his li
cense revoked by the stewards of the
Jockey Club. - . " ' .' .
Track Notes.
Brutal was strongly tipped to take the
first event, a dash for maid' n two-year
olds, which he did. handily, starting fa
vorite. Marty Bergen got home second
on Courtier, from Louis Ezt-ll's string.
Only four participated In the mi!e and
a half hurdle run. Willie Sink's all round
performer, Rio Chlco, went to the post
favorite, and with everything made pleas
ant reached home half a second before
Eva Moe. Credo ran third and Manchio
fell at the third jump.
The Bobby ran last on his previous ap
pearance, but of course waj>.up ajjalnst
better company. There was no pace made
in the mile purse run and The Bobby
made the favorite, Anjou, look like a
ferryboat doughnut. .
A terrific plunge on Walkenshaw clcsed
the afternoon's racing. The distance was
over one mile and a sixteenth and Andy
Blakeley's horse was pounded down In tho
betting from 6 to 2\k to 1. The brown
horse didn't meet with the kindest luck
and In a three-nose finish on thd wire
got the short end of It, Bell Punch yetting
the verdict from Sea Lion.
the most excitement. The handicapper
assigned top weightâ 120 poundsâ to Vul
cain, from the Hildreth stable, with his
stake companion, Wooster Boy, carrying
two pounds less. Of course, all. reliance
was placed In Vulcain, and the pair were
in hot demand at even money around post
time. Mortgage looked nicely in with. 103.
The Lady and Vesuvlan both seemed to
have royal chances, and were fancied in
that order. Of the other five starters,
Formero was the only one nibbled at to
any extent. At the post, Vesuvlan tried
to cave in the ribs of Star Chamber and
Greenock with bis heels, but Starter
Dwyer finally caught them all straight
and a pretty start was accomplished.
They were soon strung- out, with Dom
inick on Wooster Boy off in front, For
mero and The Lady in close waiting.
When the stretch was reached the Boy
fctill held his ground, with no noticeable
signs of backing up. The last was a long
quarter, though, and at the paddock the
leader wobbled and went to pieces like
the breaking up of a Yukon winter.
Mounce then laid the whip on Vcsuvian
and passing on the inside of the shaky
Wooster Boy won by a couple of lengths
In 1:41%. The Lady was not to be dis
possessed of show honors, while Vulcain
Jini.shed fourth. Ten to one could bo had
about the entry of Walter Jennings dur
ing one period of the betting.
While this proved a surprise it remained
for Seide, the; latest purchase of Sam
Hildreth, to create an even greater on< j .
As In the all-aged handicap Hiidreth
started two in the two-year- old handicap '
the crack Golden Age being ooupled with
Seide. The former carried Oomlnkk and
125 pounds. The pair ruled warm favor
ites and ran one, two throughout, only
that instead of Golden Age galloping in
first Jack Martin landed his iightweiyhtc!
mate over the line first by half a length
in a driving finish. Canmore, which
'"bucked" at the start, ran a remarkably
fine race, beating Joe Frey hands down
for the show.
IT may bÂ«Â». perhaps, that society is
becoming interested in matters per
taining to racing, after all. Two tal
ly-hos loaded "with "Blingumltes"
graced the infield at Tanforan Park
yesterday, and not a few residents of the
aristocratic suburban town mingled with
the crowd In the betting ring.
Apropos of the occasion. the lemon
Â¦with white cap colors of Prince
Poniatovi'Fki were Feen to the fore for the
first time this season, when Brutal, a
maiden 2-year-o!d, disposed of Courtier in
the opening scramble.
The pleasant weather attracted a well
filled grand stand, the ring was thronged
â¢with spectators, .ind the different events
Â¦were decided owr a good, but not fast,
track, in which favorites thrice had their
number displayed on top.
Anent the sport, which was about the
V>e?t since the inception of the meeting,
the Goodwood handicap for all ages, at a
mile, worth $750 to the winner, furnished

Mr. Bryan appeared in the best of spirits!
and had none of the marks of a man
crushed politically. As : compared to his
appearance on the eve of the election,
when he plainly bora the sign of the strain
under which he was . laboring, he looked
like a new man.
"I have received innumerable offers for
my services, comprising opportunities in
nearly all the vocations of life, but I am
not looking for a positionâ not now," and
he Joined with Mr. Towno in a hearty
laugh. "I am in the best of health and
expect to be exceedingly busy for some
time to come. I have not seen any of
the local politicians. I came here to con
sult with Mr. Towne and one or two other
men in regard to matters which I do not
care to talk about."
"I expect to remain In politics as long
as I live," said Mr. Bryan. "I shall con
tinue to advocate and work with both
tongue and pen for the principles for
which I have fought so long. I shall con
tinue to reside in Lincoln, Neb."
To the question of what he thought of
the proposed reorganization of the Demo

"1 have nothing to say on that subject
at this time. When the opportune time
comes for me to express myself I shall

recent Glee Club troubles, PreÂ«i
dent Wheeler's words regarding "the
false gods of social distinction" have
been applied to that organization's
opinions on aristocracy among sing
ers. Those outside of the Glee
Club have placed the burden of his re
marks on club members' shoulders. The
load has been accepted and the singers
are rather free to confess that they be
lieve President Wheeler was thinking
somewhat of music when he made hia
speech to the students. They feel, how
ever, that although they may have beÂ«n
the prime cause of the address, the Ideas
in it are applicable to the entire student
body. This is the general sentiment.
Naturally the faculty holds with Presi
dent Wheeler's views that there can^be
no aristocracy as between students. They
feel that for the best interests of me uni
versity it must be democraticâ purely
democratic. Professor Thomas R. Bacon,
head of the history and political economy
department and a man actively Interested
In all that concerns the personal l^fe of
the students, 6aid In' reference to yester
day's address:
"Jt was a most remarkable and thrill
ing address, the best in fact I believe I
have ever heard President Wheeler de
liver. The principles inculcated by him
wore certainly sound. The speech was
timely and to the point. Several mem
bers of the senior class spoke to me about
It at the senior social last night. All of
them declared that it was excellent , There
is a thought among the students that the
address nad particular reference to the
Glee Club. It seems to have been taken
that way by them quite generally. The
speech, I believe, will do great good."
Harley M. Leete, a senior at college and
the editor of the University Magazine,
said: "There cannot be equality of so
cial life at the university any more than
there can In San Francisco or in any
community of people. Students come
from all parts of the State and bring with
them the standing they had In the places
which they left. Accordingly they fit
Into the social life of the university. I
do not believe any university In the land
is purely democratic It Is a beautiful
state of affairs to contemplate, but It is
ideal. In reference to the Glee Club, it Is
my opinion that the social lines should be
drawn, closer than they are. The Glee
Club comes In closer contact with the peo
ple of the State than any other university
ERKELEY, Nov. 24.â President
Benjamin Ide' Wheeler drew the
clothes line on the students of
the State University yesterday
when he told them that the fact
that clothes were of the latest cut did not
necessarily mean that a real man wore
them. The president of .the official foun
tain of learning of the State told his
studehts that friends should not be
chosen because their clothing happened to
fit, entirely Ignoring the fact that fash-
Ion's latest edict does not make it neces
sary for clothing to fit. He told them that
the true democracy should exist at Berke
ley, and strongly Intimated that as the
great American constitution as revised up
to date eliminated race, color and pre
vious condition of servitude with regard
to mankind, so the unwritten constitution
of the State University should eliminate
the cut, color and previous condition of
Importation as to clothing.
This address has created no little excite
ment in Berkeley and the tailors have
gone on the war path for the scalp of the
president. Even football has been for
gotten In the excitement of the clothÂ«s
question. Students are already culti
vating a negligee air and the value of new
clothes has fallen at least one-half. The
university cadets are wondering where
they stand, between the Inspector gen
eral, who thinks that they don't dress
enough, and the president, who thinks
that they dress too much. The football
hero, dripping with the mud of tho last
few days. Is beginning to thKik that he
is the real thing. The students are in
clined to oppose President Wheeler'g
ideas, while the professors agree with
him heartily. So Berkeley has become
very much excited over President Wheel
er's address upon the old adage that "fine
feathers do not always make fine birds."
If some certain portions of the student
body look upon the speech as aiming di
rectly at them and object to it according
ly, the college men and women as a whole
admire the sentiments expressed.
Coming as they did so closely after the
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S DECLARATION THAT CLOTHES OF LATEST CUT DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN
THE NOBLEST ARTICLES OF HUMANITY CREATED A SENSATION AMONG THE STUDENTS AT THE UNI
VERSITY, AND THEY ARE FIGURING AS TO JUST WHAT IS THE PROPER THING.
in the name of F. Reichllngr, trustee. On the
1st of April. 1891. the executors flled in the
Superior Court of Alameda County a verified
report and petition prayinc for the confirma
tion of the 6ale of certain personal property
of said estate, and alleging that they had.
anionp other property, sold certain shares of
stork of the Kennedy Mining and Milling Cora
par.y; that deeming it for the best interest
of said estate they had sold **ld property at
private sale without notice, that all of paid
property was present at the time of sale, thai
the sums realized were the full value of said
property at the time of sale and that paid
sales were in all respects fairly and legally
made and conducted. On April 13, 1S91, an order
was made confirming said 6ales.
Among the sale of Kennedy 6tock eo reported
were 1600 shares sold to George C. Hlckox for
J4T76. on February 4. 1891: UÂ«Â» shares to E. D.
Rue for J3S75 on March 13, 1S9L No shares at
all were sold to Hickox. The excutors merely
divided I6O1) shares among themselves. aÂ« fol
low*: Five hundred shares to H. 1L Pitcher.
tOO rhares to John Taylor. SCO shares to ThomaÂ»
H. B. Varney. _
Pitcher testified that the 1100 shares of Ken
nedy stock reported to have been sold to E.
D. Rue were in fact bought by himself and
his sister. 5C0 for him and 600 for her. The
books of the Kennedy Mining and Milling
Company show, however, that 1600 shares al
tcsuher were transferred to H. H. Pitcher, of
which 1000 shares came directly from the 6tock
of the estate standing in the name of F. Reich
ling, trustee, and only 600 shares from that
standing in the name of K. D. Rue.
Tcylor testified that on June S. 1891. he bought
200 shares of the Kennedy stock belonging to
the estate, which he gave to his wife and
Henry B. Varney. the confidential clerk of the
trustees, testified that in October. 1S91, he pur
chased 4J0 shares of Kennedy stock, BO shares in
November. lbSl. and 200 shares in April, 1895:
that his first purchase (he thinks) was made
from the Judson estate through Duperu. a
brr.ker. and that none of Jhe stock was pur
chased by him from Pitcher. The books of the
Kennedy company show that 600 shares stand In
the name of Henry B. Varney. of which 400
sharr-s came directly from H. H. Pitcher and
ZW from N. Duperu, trustee, all of which were
a part pi the stock originally owned by Thomas
Varney at the time of his death. The question
whether Henry B. Varney should be charged
as a trustee in respect to any of the stock held
by him will be reserved until the final hearing
of the cause.
Five hundred shares of the Kennedy stock
standing' in the name of Mrs. Clara T. Clark.
who is the daughter of John Taylor, were paid
with $1500 borrowed by her from the Bank of
Livermore on l:er promissory note, which was
subsequently paid by her husband, L#. G. Clark,
with his own money. The evidence shows that
the nerotletions for the purchase were made
with Mr. Taylor by Mr. Clark and that the
purchase was not made by Taylor from the es
tate. I do not think that Taylor should be
charg-ed as a trustee for the payment of that
stock.
What has been said as to the effect of the
decree settling the account of the executors
upon the title of the estate to the 130 shares
of bank stock applies also to the 1600 shares of
Kennedy stock reported to have been sold to
Hickox.
Judge Seawell's conclusions are that the
three trustees owe to the Varney estate
the 130 shares of the Bank of. Livermore
Btock that they hold and the 1600 shares
by the Kennedy mine stock;' that while
they only secured for the estate 2V4 per
cent upon the money they managed that
they cannot be held for anv deficiency;
that they should be. held for all loans made
by the Bank of Livermore without secur
ity which resulted in loss; that the trus
tees could hold any salaries received from
the Bank of Livermore, but that they
should refund to the Varney estate the
money received as fees for attending
meetings by the bank and that Thomas
II. B. Varney should refund the amount
received for exporting the books by the
bank; that the Pitcher estate should re
fund the Insurance commissions received
for Insuring the bank property; that
Thomas H. B. Varney should be charged
for the use of a lot on Fifteenth street
since April 13. 1831; that the trustees paid
the estate 6 per cent for the use of mon^y
with which to purchase stock that was
drawing 12.85 per cent In dividends; that
as officers of the bank they loaned the
money of the estate upon personal secur
ity and took it for their own use; that
they were negligent in allowing the Gar
cia mortgage to grow from $57,000 to $104,
000; that H. H. Pitcher, a trustee and offl.
cer of the bank, as a member of the firm
of Knight. Cohen & Co., secured a loan of
53000 from the bank upon which the bank
had to get a Judgment for $43% 52.
The removal of the trustees Is then
ordered.

In regard to the sale of the Kennedy

Judge Scaweil says:
The purchase by a trustee at his own sale, in

Â¦beneficiary and the statute does not begin to

plaintiffs' ciaim is barred by the statute of
limitations.
My conclusion is that the 130 shares of hank
rtor-k in question are a part of the estate of
Tliomaf 1 Vfcmey. deceased. As to the ten shares
purchased by Henry B. Varney from Henry H.
Pitcher, I find that the former, at the time
of hU purchase, had notice of the title of the
*-â¢Â».â¢_â¢- to the stock and that he acquired do
jrre&ter r'.ifhts than Pitcher had. The estate of
Pitcher. Ttiomas H. B. Varney, Taylor aad
Henry B. Varney should now be charged with
the 120 snare* of stock and credited with the
scnoucts which they paid for the stock, less the
crhount of dividends collected thereon.
It wan therefore the duty of the executors to
have Â»et <?own th* 139 shares claimed by them
end by Lankan in the inventory which they
f.k 3 ar.d whether mentioned in the inventory cr

Judge Seawell goes into all of the testi
mony of the case In his opinion. In re-
f arc to the Bank of Livermore stock deal
he says:
Tboma* Varney was probably the most
Â¦wealthy man in tae Livermore Valley.
vvbea he died, eome dozen years ago, he
left his estate tied up In a trust with H.
H. Pitcher, his confidential man: Thomas
H. 2J. Varney, his nephew, and John Tay
lor, bis friend, as trustees. His estate
coceisved mostly of money, something
ever Slfci.OOQ being thÂ« capital stock of the
Bank of Livermore. The three trustees
were paid a salary to handle the estate
and handled it by putting it all in the
Banl^ of Livermore, where there is nearly
t*uu,WJ on depotlt. The bank then handled
the estate, and H. 11. Pitcher, one of the
trustees, was the president of the bank.
This is not regarded so seriously by Judge
Seawell as he regards the purchase of the
stock of tee bank by the trustees, who
gave their notes on the bank in payment
lor the stock. The trustees also purchased
dining stock from the estate, borrowing
money from the bank to make the pur
chase. Some of the heirs under the will
objected to these acts and brought the
suit through Charles S. Wheeler and A.
J. Treat of Ban Francisco.

Judge Seawell to-day removed the two
eurviviris trustees of the estate of Thomas
varney, the deceased Livermore capital
ist, and his decision is full of charges of
mismanagement and even direct fraud.
Under this decision John Taylor and
Thomas II. B. Varney are removed, and
action against them for the recovery of

taken. The other trustee, H. H. Pitcher,

"President Wheeler's speech pleaded me
very much. I heartily Indorse everything
he said. â ~
"I fully indorse President Wheeler's re
marks. I believe that following the prin
ciples of democracy is the only way a
college can exist. This has been in my
mind before, but President Wheeler has
given it voice in a delightful manner. We
must work toward this ideal point which
he has placed for us."
J. W. S. Butler, a prominent senior and
business manager of the Californian, took
the view that social distinction as an un
avoidable evil must continue to exist.
"What President Wheeler told us " he
said, "was all proper If it ever could be
made to work. With so many different
kinds of people here from so many differ
ent places it would be hard to abolish so
cial distinction. It seems to me it would
be impossible to ever reach that point
where no social lines were drawn. It
shouldn't be so. but with people as they
now are it cannot well be otherwise."
J. C. Merrlam. associate professor of
palaeontology and historical geology.
Profeesor W. B. Rising, dean of the col
lege of chemistry, agreed with President
Wheeler's ideas. He said:
"It was the most magnificent speech de
livered In my knowledge in the precincts
of the university. It was courageous, fer
vent and sincere. No other distinction can
be countenanced in college but that of
truly manly and womanly conduct and
high scholarship. From what I have
heard the students are with him heart
and soul. For my part, I subscribe- to
every sentence that he uttered."
Frederick Cuttle, president of the col
lege of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation and a junior, had this to say:
"What President Wheeler said is right,
but it is theoretical. Social distinction
does exist here, as in outside places. I
have been thinking over what was said
and believe President Wheeler has fixed
for us an ideal point toward which we
should earnestly work. He was correct,
and what he said was beautiful."
organization. The young men should be
morally the best we have. This has not
always been so and some members in the

according to account. The 1 - band Is to be
divided into two sections, the Gianninl
faction to be conducted by Slgnor Mlno
liti and the Channing Ellery set will prob
ably to be under the leadership of Slgnor
Creatore.
The Channing, Ellery crowd, mostly the
reeds and hornsâ largely recruited from
the old Banda Rossi, by thÂ© way â will go
directly to Philadelphia and there begin
work again. They will retain their title
of the Royal Marine Band of Italy.
The Minolltl-Giannlni faction, who claim
to have absorbed all the soloists,
with the exception of Creatore (over
twenty members all told), will take the
road beginning next Monday evening at
Sacramento.

peter: De Xatall, De TItta. the barytone;
Giralomo, Gianninl himself, who sings a
fair tenor, and Minolitl, who Is no mean

In addition, it Is strictly within the
probabilities that some of the late Azzali
company will be engaged and the organi
zation is to be known by the name of the
"Original Royal Marine Band of Italy."
MUSIC WORLD
BY BLANCHE PRRTINGTON.
â¢^..p AN FRANX1SCO Is to have
/I A yv mor e Calve, this time to the
\>O<\ tune of one of the most, wildly
y romantic exploits in which even
tf-~^/ this greatest of all Carmens
has ever indulged her passion
ate, picturesque self. The New
York World- tells the story, and besides
Its interest from the world-musical stand
point, San Francisco has been promised
the Calve Carmen next year under Mau
rice Grau's direction, and the other pictu
resque personality in the case has already
achieved a wide renown here, but of the
most ultra opposite character.
It seems- that the diva has been living
in constant fear for mart*- months of an
operation which her physicians have de
clared absolutely necessary for the safety
of her.lifo and health, and Calve is afraid,
pitifully, helplessly', qulverfhgly afraid of
the torture that she pictures with all the
passionate, vivid, lavish Imagination put
to use in her famous impersonations. She
will and she will not bow to the physi
cians' dictum. One day, driven by the
greater fear of an unending 1 ph.ys.lcal suf
ferLng, she. consents to the us=e of the
knife; the next, crazed by an immediate
terror, she withdraws her consent. And
thus has It been for maoy 'lays.
Then Into this atmosphere of tumult and
torture there came stranBe whispers of
yet another way â a whisper that by oc
cult Influences, exercise of faith, submis
sion to certain rules of life, she might be
come whole again, and y there in her
friend's Paris drawing-room was the con
venient prophet of the new 'way, the
Swami Vivekananda, Hindoo monk, hlgh
caste Brahmin and head and front of the
ancient Vedanta philosophy of India. The
drawing-room was that of Mrs. F. H.
LegKett, wife of the New' York grocer,
whose summer, salon in Paris during the
exposition year has been such an. amaz
ing social success. The Princess Deml
doff, one of the social autocrats of Paris,
Is' yet another -figure In the romance, and
"all manner of high-born pilgrims," nays
the "World, found themselves in the "Leg
gett menagerie," drawn thither , by the
lame of the wonderful teacher.
The Swami himself is well known and
well loved in America. He came first to
this country to the "World's Fair, where
of Religions, his magnetic and lovable
his brilliant contributions to the Congress
personality, his keen and" polished Intel
lect and, not least, his picturesque and
majestic figure In Its robe of wonderful
red, made all sorts of favorable impres
sions upon his audiences. The monk was
In San Kranclsco also only this year,
teaching and preaching for three or four
months.
The Swami taught the singer his philo
sophy of life, the spiritual dietâ imagine
Calve on a spiritual diet! â and told her
to have faith :ind be cured. The singer
feels a savage faith in anything that
promises to save her from the surgeon's
knife. She says she .will do anything:
undertako a pilgrimage to the sacred
Himalayas, anil the Swami shall lead it!
And that is the latest word of the sing
er's whims. She will go to India by way
of Constantinople, for that is so pic
turesque, and through the Holy Land she
will look so handsome on a camel â then
to India to find freedom from her physical
ills through occult lore and mystic rites.
It is the afterward which chiefly con
cerns us.
Well, Calve has not yet decided the
further programme. Up to date it ends
in India. Japan has been spoken of as a
further point Â«if pilgrimage, but as to the
life thereafter Calve keeps silence.
Strange if the orilllant career begun amid
the gauds and r.oise and fever of stage
splendors shouid end in the deep tranquil
heart of the Himalayan Mountains! Yet
strunger things have happened In the
mysterious annals of the mo.Â«t ancient re
ligion known to man. The pressing ques
tion now Is whether. If Calve "gets re
liKion," shall we get Carmen?
The. following clipping concerning the
tour of Mme. Sembrich, v.-ho will be heard
out here in the earlier spring of '01, will
be of interest under present musical con
ditions in San Francisco. The skit Is
taken from the New York Herald of No
vember 11:
Mme. Sembrich will be heading this way from
Kurope within a fortnight, bringing the mem
bers of her opera company with her Tor a tour
ot this country. Hiie is giving a brier opera
season in Berlin, singing "I Purltanl," "II
Uarblere," "Hlffoletto" and "Faust" at th*
new Royal Opera-house, after which she will
give a few concerts In Vienna and Budapest
and then sail for New Tork on November 24
Mr. Uaff ' takes tier In charge, Just as he
did Mme. Gadski, and over the country she
will go. ffh'lng -concerts and operatic perform
ances in those cities that have "that wanting
feeling" for grand opera In Italian.
Mme. Sembrich Is not a. member of Mr
Giau's company this season, but It's dollars
to doughnuts that when the cold north wind
end the icy east wind and all the other kinds
of winds begin to whistle around the Metropoli
tan and play the mischief with some of 3Ir.
Grau's soprani something of this sort will go
over the wires from New York to somewhere:
. C. 1*. Graff, Academy of Music: All my
soprani except Bauermelster have certifl
Â¦' cates from Dr. Ilolbrook Curtis. Can you
possibly lban me Sembrich for three per
formances? Tell her New . York is dying
to hear her and that they say that she Is
.â¢the only living Rostna and Gilda. Be sure
to say this and answer, quick, cher ami
GRAU.
Grau, Metropolitan. New Ycrk (collect):
Can't possibly let you have Sembrich. Am
all sold out for two weeks In advance and

"Graff, Academy of. Music: Send me a dis
patch, anyhow, similar to one I sent you
when Gadskl was indisposed on your tour
last season. Make It strong and something
I can show. . GRAU.
Grau, Metropolitan," New York (collect) â¢
Sorry to hear y^u have illness in your com

on and take the place of any of your sin

Mrs. Clarence Mackay wore a varied
and beautiful assortment of gowns during
"horse show week." The most conspicu
ous was a long driving coat of magnificent
Russian sable. In one of her black gowns
she had undersleeves.of gold colored satin
with very tight wristbands fastened with
tiny gold filigree tassels.
Conspicuous In one of the boxes was
Mrs. Herman Oelrlchs. She wore a tailor
made gown of the new green, which is a
warmer and darker shade than reseda,
but without the faintest' olive tint. Mrs.
Oelrlchs' gown was severely -plain, being
relieved only by stitched bands of the
same shade and a triple vest of white
satin, embroidered In green; green satin
with traceries of gold and soft gold gauze,
striped with sable. She carried a sable
muff. . _
Mrs. George Law. the noied beauty of
the Four Hundred, who has recently re
turned from Paris, wore a swagger cos
tume of heavy lusterless blacn. shk, cut en
prlncesse and trimmed with Irregular
waving bands of handsome black lace,
outlined with tiniest pailettes of black.
Beneath the lace there showed a jupon of
glittering moire in the new shade of helio
trope which modistes call orchid. Sho
had for an outer garment a superb coat
of ermine lined with tucked orchid satin
and an ermine toque with orchid crown
and green leaves and one perfect orchid
arranged a Â¦ la pompon directly In the
back. Â¦ ' >
With tl-.at foolish look which always
distinguishes the victim of a box-office
chill he slided out from behind the brass
rail and said audibly: "Daughter, your
father has been turned down."
"I think, father, there is a marked wane
in your popularity," she replied.
It was an atrocious pun, but the box
office man caught on and said: "Oh,
Mark Twain, is It?" and hastened to make
apology for his awkward mistake.
The event of the week has been, of
course, the Horse Show and, although
there was a notable absence of some of
the bright lights of society, it was never
theless voted a huge success. The at
tendance on the opening night (Monday,
November 19) was large. That does not
express Mt. There was barely standing
room for those who had not engaged seats
or boxes.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â In spite of the
Horse Show, Mark Twain, former Call
fornlan and newly repatriated humorist,
for the present is the biggest thing in
Greater New York. He Is nothing short
of a real lion and looks the part with hla
great silvery mane. He Is deluged on all
sides with invitations, which he has been
compelled to decline by wholesale. He
accepted one recently, and as a result the
great American humorist came nearly be
ing "turned down." He. was offered a box
at the Criterion Theater the other, night
to see "Gay Lord Quex" played by the
celebrated comedian Hare of London.
Mark Twain is a great friend of the Eng
lishman. On arriving at the theater with
ladles, the humorist inquired for Mr.
Clemens' box and was told rather curtly
that there was none for him.

NEW YORK, Nov. 21. -The Financier says:
The banks continue to reflect the gains in cash
made through operations with the sub-treasury
and the interior. Receipts of Australian gold
transferred to New York rtgrures in swelling the
total. The current statement shows an expan
sion of no less than Si.SiO.OOO in specie and
*l,64S.S0O In legal tenders, lt a pain of $7.53$,-
SCK) since November 17. "this addition is In
excess of what known or>e!ati"r.s reveal, but
conceding its accuracy the clearing house banks
bave placed a substantial amount to their sur
plus reserve. The net increase was fi.6Os.:.0O
for the reason that the rise- of $J1.121.2Â» in de
posits necessitated an added 1 la;ral reserve of
nearly $3,000,uo0. The interesting feature of the
Ftiuatlon locally is the moderate expansion In
loans since the election. On November 3 last
the loan total of the bank.: stood at $7S2.330,300,
or within a few hundred thousand dollars of
Saturday's Fhowlnir. and â¢ since November D
the gain has been only K.QOO.fKK): this, too. at
the clof=e of three weeks' Stock Exchange busi
ness that has broken all records. Since No
vember 3 the banks bavo added JS.72l.90O to
cash holdings, while deposits. have ris<?n less
than flO.000,000. It will ue seen that clearing
houre institutions ere in a much stronger po
sition than Just previous io the election. It Is
questionable whether tnÂ«? drift toward larger
reserves will be maintained. One factor that
confuse? calculations en this point Is the con
tinued investment buying which characterizes
the present market. Everything points to a
still further accumulation of gilt-edged securi
ties in these channels. The outlook, so far as
money is concerned. Is not to be Judged oy
comparisons that may be made with . past
yeare for the reason that the- absorption of do
mestic cold production In these channels an<l
from Alaska and the .rreat rise in national
bank notes have resulted in a per capita cir
culation In exceEs of anything heretofore
known, so that while more business is being
done the country has more money to do lt with
and possesses heavy credit balances abroad that
can be drawn upon If necessary.

only to be driven to cover with 1'iKse* at
higher prices. But It Is a matter of course
that the further the market advances the more
, vulnerable it bc-omea and the nearer it op
j preaches to the period of reaction. The tears
l-ave bad better succc-ss in making lmiires
sions on price* during the latter part of the
Â»wk than at any time since the electi m.
But while the desires of a t*?ar short on the
market are all for lower prices his neKls .ire
a powerful influence for advance. Forc-ii buy-
Ing from clcsxl-out shorts has helpo<l th'Â» 8'i
vanoe ir.ore than once In the last two w*?kf.
A conspicuous instance of this character was
offered by the London market. London Drokerj
sold privileges to buy American stocks on a
very lanre scale before election, which aro sub
let to redemption at the pÂ«rlo.\ical Stock Ex
chanp* settlements, one of which occurs on
nert Tuf-SKlar. When prices 1> van to advance
here London continued to sell with confidence,
or with the hope of checking thn advance. But
the London operators apparently decMed to
take their losses this week and not tai;e th?
rlrk of seeing them grow by a further adx-^nc;.
On Wednesday London bought more stocks in
New York than on any previous day. the total
being estimated at 200.OXI shares. ThÂ» Euro
pean short interest was largest in Northern
Pacific and the covering had not a llttlo to
do with that stock's sensational advance. Th>Â»
effect of the Bummer and autumn period "of
disoourajrement from the practical fallurv of
the spring wheat crop converged on th's Â»icrk
ar.d was aggravated by the action of the di
rectors in refraining from declaring the extra
1 per cent dividend at thÂ« time they declared
the regular 1 per cent for the half-year. On
September 29 the etock sold at ii%,. On .Vednes
day of this week it sMd at 74 1 *. The chi.r.gr?s
in the conditions of this company and its
policy and the sentiment toward Its stock are
typical cf the changes In the whole ep.?ca
lative situation. Not only has there been
buoyant confidence In renewing businet-s by
buying and by making contracts to buy, t.ised
on the afsurance that prices vrouM tro iu
lower, but there has been an astonishing un
locsenir.Â«r of credits In the money market. The
continued digestion of profits in the eto:K mar
ket was another element of the prolonged
strength.
Active business has been done in bonds, but
It has at r.o time approached the high record

The best buying was by local shorts, who. Im
pressed by the cables and a predicted decrease
in the visible, Monday, were disinclined to re
main fully unprotected over Sunday. December
opened "4c higher at 70*4 to 70Tjc and within a
few minutes touched 70"*c. From this point
the . market slowly reacted to TlVic and closed
flrm; %i& Me over yesterday at 71VÂ»c.
Corn was a quiet and flrm market, but the
corner in the November deal failed to create
excitement. Mr. Phillips, who has cornered
the supply of November, took in a few lots on
a small decline early. Subsequently he seemed
inclined to n?st and observe what the market
would do without him. Small country offer-
Ings and wet weather West were factors in
stiffening deferred futures. â¢ December closed
: l ic higher at 36%c. November closed Vsc up at
45c. The trade Jn oats was visible to the naked
eye, but that was about all. December closed
unchanged at 217-ic. â¢ i
Provisions were flrm and active. The market
opened easy, but rallied sharply on the light
hog receipts and an advance in hog prices at
the yards. Tackers were actively buying pork.
Toward the end of the session the market in

keeping with this find; the hill has alway*
been more or less eccentric In the manner
in which it would provide bonjLaza
pockets.
There Is considerable activity reported
in Inyo County raining properties. Sen*
ator Clark of Montana has bought tha
Silver Peak mine, the price being $600,000.
The Montezuma mine has been sold to
Chicago parties after several years of
idleness, for $25,000. A contract has been
let for ten additional stamps at the Re
ward mine.
Notes from Calaveras County are that
work has been resumed at the North Star
srravel mine in Happy Valley; that thÂ«
Gwln mine is operating with water power
and a full complement of eighty stamps j
and that eighty men are at work on the 1
Hexter mine at the head of Jackass
Gulch.
Late reports from Searchlight. Nev., indi
cate a great deal of work being done In that
camp, the ore bodies maintaining good values
with depth. On the Copper King, one of the
group of claims Belonging to the Quartette
Company,- a Boston corporation, the vein,
which was from three, to .four feet wide on the
turface. has increased to twenty-four feet in I
width at a depth ot 300 feet, the ore running I
from $25 to $35 per ton. . '
The Keystone Mining Company is develop- I

which is now in 300 feet, and which tapped the i
lead at a depth of 143 feet. C. B. Chittenden of
New York and some Pennsylvania men are tho ]
owners of the property. Other properties In (
this district that are being developed with suc
cess are the Buena Vista, the New Era claims,
the Maxine and the Princess group. As In
most mining camps, water has been scarce and
a company has been organized to bring water
from the timber mountain range, ten 'miles
distant from the camp. !
Colorado papers report a strike In a
Cripple Creek mine of an Inch streak of
almost solid gold in the vein In the second
level, the values running $8000 a ton. The
streak runs throtigh the, vein for a dis
tance of twelve feet, Â¦when the values are
again scattered through the mass of rock,
lowering the bonanza character of the
shoot. The rich core is an exception and
no one counts on its being anything more

to prove that the land Is desirable from a

The Los Angeles Times has the follow
ing concerning the comparatively new
Searchlight district in Nevada:
existence of the association and its works, but
fortunately the number of thesa is becoming
beautifully less year by year as more of the
Silurians begin to shed their old skins and
awake to a sight of their interests. The Im
portance of Â¦ the work of a body representing
the growing mining Interests of this State can
hardly be overestimated, particularly when, as
now. Its principal work concerns needed legis
lation. Along this line the miners have^ many
needs, muclr to ask for and much to expect.
The Southwest Miners' Association has
installed a free labor exchange and has
plans for a large exhibition, including
specimens of oil from different districts.
.Miners in Tuolumne and neighboring
counties " have been disturbed over the
appearance of "scrlppers" in the gold
mining regions. A postponed hearing will
take place in Stockton on Tuesday, the

ton-on the 14th lnst. The Stockton Inde
pendent makes the following statement of
the controversy: ,Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ . -Vi
The "delegation of Tuolumne County miners
are prepared. to fight the application of repre
sentatives of the Republican mine, who . are
said to be trying to secure title to necessary
forking ground by the use of scrip. The miners
say they have no complaint to make against the
Republican mine management, but they must
protest against the introduction of scrip to dis
turb miningr .titles, and when scrlppers appear
In any case they will be fought. The Repub
lican mine le located on the mother lode, near
Jacksonville, and Is believed to be a good one.
Tho mine . has been Â¦ thoroughly developed and
gives promise. of being a good property. The
mill is located some distance from the shaft
and it is claimed that it became necessary to
obtain title to ground between the shaft and the
mill for the proper working of the mine. Satis
factory terms could not be made for the de
sired ground, hence application was made for.
the filing of scrip on certain described tracts
and the matter is before the local land offices.,
Miners. tell of instances where scrip haa been

their properties for many years. To put a etop
to such t work is the object of the combination
for defense among; the mining men.
The litigation concerning the. Yellow
Aster mine has reached a hearing In the
Â¦United States Circuit Â¦ Court at Los An
geles before Judge Ross. In the original
suit the Yellow Aster Company filed a
complaint. to quiet title to one-half of the
mine. The defendants are E. B. Stan ton,

W. S. Wood, W. R. Maschmeyer, J. H.

demurrer to the cn>6s bill. The defendants*
claim that when F. M. Mooers, C. .A
'Burcham â¢ and John Singleton : first ob
tained possession of the mine, which aft
terward v proved a '- bonanza, Burcham
agreed to sell one-half to Stanton, who al
leges that he paid $100 on the contract and
expended much meney in ; opening and
developing the property. According to the
defendants,'. It was only through the Â¦ ex
penditure by Stanton that tho true value
of the mine was discovered, and then the
original owner refused to consider that
Stanton was a ; part owner In the mine.
Tho - defendants ~ ask ', for â¢ one-half the

Again a gold excitement Is occurring
on ; the ; Navajo reservation, occupying a
large area In Northwest New Mexico and

would perhaps be impotent'. . < '
W. G. Scott, superintendent of the Mount
Shasta Gold Mines. Limited, writes In the
following vigorous fashion: Â¦ .
in reference to the formation of the Northern
California Miners' Asscciatlon, I assure you
I am heartily In favor of the project. North
ern California has no business tagging along 1
at the tall end of the procession. It should be
up at the front, next Â¦ the band. "The I>ord
helps those who help themselves." It there
fore behooves all those Interested in the min
ing Industry in Shasta. Trinity and Slskiyou
counties to get a move onâ and an energetic
move, too. Â¦
These communications were addressed
to Mineral Wealth, published at Redding,
Shasta County, in response to queries.
The association was not formed before
the assembling of the California Miners'
Convention, but will probably soon be In
shape. The Southwest Miners' Associa
tion and the Petroleum Miners' Â¦ Associa
tion Indicated tholr appreciation of the
value of concerted action by sending dele
gates to the convention.
Concerning the- utility Â¦Â¦ of. State organi
zation, <the southern part of the State is
represented by the Los Angreles Herald
as entertaining views as follows:
' There are some mining men who deprecate the
The earnest Â¦words of "W. C. RaJston,
used In his last annual address as presi
dent of the California Miners* Association,
concerning the necessity of the better or
ganization and more vigorous action of
miners in their own behalf, have met with
general approval. The trend of sentiment
may be Inferred from several letters
written by prominent mining men In
Northern California. H. Z. Osborne, pres
ident of the Union Consolidated uoid
Mines Company, which recently acquired
the Lawrence mine on. Union Creek, Trin
ity County, indorses the idea of institut
ing a Northern California Miners' Associ
ation. He writes: '. J:.
The rood-it will do consists In the facility
such an organization affords for the expression
of the wish of the miners of the section In
matters affecting: their several Interests, North
ern California would be greatly benefited by
more attention from the State and national
governments In the way of geological surveys,
especial reports of geologists and mining; en-
Klneers and In Â¦ other legitimate w&ys. The
importance of Its mineral resources, developed
and undeveloped, amply Justifies such atten
tion. An organization on broad lines, such as
Is contemplated, can accomplish important re-
Another increase in the net stocks in
tanks by the various pipe lines in the
Pennsylvania and Buckeye oil fields was
recorded during October. Shipments of
Pennsylvania oil took a drop of 4000 bar
rels a day, while nearly 6000 barrels a day
increase was made in the runs. The
Buckeye- shipments .were the heaviest of
the present yeax. The runs were In excess,
of those for September. J
In October the extwrt* of mineral' oils frorl
the TTnlted State* were as follows: Crude. 11.
012,295 gallons; naphtha*, 1.534,904 gallons: Illu
minating. 71.2S7.2S! gallons ; lubricating and par

The San Benito Advance reports that T.
L. Baldwin haa leaped 640 acres to the Pio
neer Oil Company, the property being. Â»ix
miles south of HolllBter on the Palmtag
road.
In thÂ« Coalinga field the Home Oil Com
pany's new 33.0&0 barrel tank Is completed
and oil Is now being run Into It. The
company Is putting up -a derrick for its
No. 8 -well now and is still drilling on
wells No. 6 and 7.
I The land northwest of Los Angeles Is
described by the local papers as a "new
Kl Dorado." Nevertheless it is reported on
the same authority that "there are few T
.successful companies, but that is owing
to the fact that operations liave not been
confined to any one section, but have
been scattered from one end of the field
to the other. Although scattered, in al
most every well oil hag been found, but,
unfortunately in many, water- also."
Something like a score of oil companies
are prospecting in the new field.
The International Oil Company, which
drilled two dry holes at Its location In the
Coyote hills beyond East Whittler, han
eold out its personal property to the Safe
Oil Company of Newhall. The rig has
been shipped to Newhall.
About a month ago A. OnÂ», the oil expert.
was called over to the ground of. the 'VVatson
ville Oil Company for the purpose of locating a
well. The company has expended about $45,000
in development work and all the company has
to show for It are some rigs and 'a few wells
with about Ore barrels apiece In them. After
a. thoroush examination cf the country Mr.
,Onu located a cite for the company and has
guaranteed a 50-barrel well.
The Sau Lucas Weekly Herald says:
The San Diego Union reports that the
steamer St. Denis will take down the ma
chinery for drilling an oil well at Cape
Colnett. Lower California.
The report that the Santa Fe haa de
cided to curtail work in the Fullerton field
is denied. The company will, so the re
port goes, have ten strings of tools at
work as soon as possible.
The Marin-Journal reports two leases of
lands at Bolinas to oil prospectors. One
2s held by the Bolinas Bay Oil Company
and the other by S. Sherman of Salt Lake.
Contention will eventually be chronicled as
one of the greatest ever started In the West.
There are many companies which report
readiness to begin operations. Aniong
these are the Paraffin* Oil Company in the
Purisslma Canyon in San Mateo County;
the Midway of Oregon, in the Kern River

Rincon, in Orange County.
â¢ The output of the Kern River field Is in
creasing at a rapid rate, as shown by the
railroad shipments. When the branch
into the territory was first put into opera
tion the daily shipments amounted to
a.bout twenty carloads, which Included an.
excess resulting from the wait for the rail
road. Now the number of carloads turned
off each day is between forty-five and
fiftv. The train is cut into two sections.
The American Mines Development Com
pany of Minneapolis, Minn., is about to

MINING NEWS OF THE PACIFIC COAST.
January 1, 13C1. is the elate fixed for the
a.ctu&i beginning of business at Bakeis
fteld by the Oil Producers' Asfociation.
The purpofe of the association. a_s has
been previously published, is to handle
the petroleum ovitput of Kern County and
to regelate prices. The Kern Cour.ty pa
pers are confident that practically all the
petroleum product cf the county will, by
January next, be uud^r the control of the
r.Fsociation, and that .he association wii!
handle the great balk of the oil. The
question of tar.kage iias been considered
en obftacle. but, according to the Bakers*
2:c!d California:}, "th's has been done away
%vith virtually by individual companies,
which have erected .-tor: ge reservons
with a capacity. a!i told, of more tlia-a
200.000 barrels. Whatever else is needed
the association can attend to."
The placing of a tirne for the association
to operate may soon result in more fully
developing the plan? of the Standard Oil
Company in Kern County, which aiv
Fcmewhat of a mystery. Of course, if
the Oil Producers' Association takes anci
pells all the product of the county, there
will be little use for the storage tajiks of
the Standard OH in that vicinity, unless
:he Standard people become nrouueers on
a "ajge scale. Competition is no new
thing to the Standard Oil Company. The
tltuatJon Is at once interesting and unique.
The capacity of the Kern County oil fieids
is. difficult of accurate estimation. The
product will soon be much larger. A cor
respondent, writing a 'lively account from
Bakersfic-1<} of the- conditions existing.
makes the statement that development
work is going on in the fields faster than
erer before, now that cooler weather per
mits of teaming.
"All who are inter^Pted." writes the
oorrespondent. "are confident that the
market is a sponge thai will absorb a!:
the oil they can pour upon it. In con
versation with soraf of the principal oper
ators, among them C. P. Oanfield. I lind
that the capacity of tlie river lield Is im
mense, considerably greater* than is gen
erally supposed. There is or,Â» firm here
that claims that it can deliver 6503 barrels
of oil a. day. if need hf."
Some account of the crowded condition
at BakersfieM was rrabUsbÂ«d two weeks
Â«go in thin pap^r. The Â« - rirresn.-iTirlfnt v.ho
js quoted in the foregrunt: tells of an en
terprislnjr man from Arizona who Is '-rtin

Rets fifty cents per nipht for a <ot in a
tent. "A railroad man arrived here with
liis wife yesterday morning and failed to
lind a place in which to stay. They were
in no wise daunted and I found them this
rnorninp putting up a tent on Chester
avenue." BakerrfieM is the' liveliest oil
town in the State now.
