by a blaze of colored fire, lockets, tiring

planse. Yet he looked upon a smaller
number of persons than composed the
crowd that had been unable to find stand

With an original programme of j
five stops in to-day's itinerary j
Senator Hanna's train stopped
at fourteen towns in Minnesota
and South Dakota during the day. with
Watertown . for the- principal stopping
place. So much pressure wa*s brought to
bear by committees from various points
along the line not lncluued In the itlnei
ary and by Minnesota and South Dakota
Congressmen through whose district the
train ran that Senator Hanna consented
to make brief talks at as many station:,

travel and nearly every town of any im
portance through tho valley of the Min

Western Minnesota and Eastern South
Dakota Senators Hanna and Frye ami

Large crowds were present at nearly
every stopping place, farmers In some in

many times by questioners, though al
ways apparently in a friendly spirit.
In. one or two instances in Minnesota,
through that part of the State noted for
its dairy, industries and stock raising, the
speakers paid some attention to the tariff
question, but the. speaking generally was
on the trusts and prosperity^ ,
"That's all the . people seem to care
about," said Senator Hanna to-night. "All
they want apparently is to be assured of
the continuance of the present conditions.
The sentiment seems to be all one way.

Former Minister to America Slain by
Order of Dowager Empress.
WASHINGTON. Oct. lS.-Confirmatlon
has been rerrlved here of the execution on
July 20 of Chang Yon Hoon. the former
Chinese Minister to the United States.
Chang was a loyal adherent of the Em
peror and a warm supporter of the lat

two y*>ars ago he was ordered to be be

WASHINGTON. Oct. 15.â The cable dis
patch from St. Petersburg, indicating that
Russia's attitude In China will be inde
pendent of the concert of the powers,
cpusrd no surmise among officials here. It
Â¦was noted when the aggressive military
movement was br-fruri by Germany and the
expedition sgainst Paoting Fu started,'
that Russia was among the powers which
<".1<J not join in th* movement. The dis
j atrh from Ft. Petersburg is looked on as
merely another step similar to that taken
v.hen Russia v.-Jthhold support from the
PactSng Fn expedition and other aggres
rivo military moves. Moreover, it is re
rardrd as quite in consonance with the
pnoific tendencies of this Government,
which have been directed all along to se
curing a settlement by diplomatic means,
rnther than by the sword.
The expectation Is that the Chinese Gov
ernment Is about to utilize all its re
sources of duplicity to keep the powers
occupied with vain negotiations and pro
posals and the dispatching of notes in or
der to gain time until the winter, counting
on the rigors of the climate to prevent
military operations and allow China to
prepare her resources for a spring cam
paicn.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 16.â The Rus
sian Government permits It to become
known that its attitude In China will be to
increase the independence of the concert
of the powers. Russia. It is explained,
is disposed to attach loss value to joint
action, since her Interests have been fully
secured by the successful campaign in
Manchuria. Moreover, Russia is not will-
Ing to "follow the Irreconcilable policy of
Fome of the powers."

BTJSSIA'S STAND IN CHINA.
Inquiries are being made by foreign
Governments as to the action of the
United State?, .and they are expected to
make immediate appointment of their
representatives on the international court.
The organization of this body is espe
cially important in view of the proposal
of the Russian Government to have it de
termine the amount of indemnity China
phould pay for the outrages committed
and expenses incurred by the powers.
Junpre George Gray of Delaware was at
the White House to-day and talked with
the President relative to his appointment
tis a member of The Hague International
Court of Arbitration. He had called at
the State Department to see Secretary
Hay relative to the duties of the foreign
office tendered to him, but the Secretary
was at the Cabinet meeting, and he saw
Mr. Adee. Judge Gray told me he had
not formally accepted the appointment,
but would do so.
report received this afternoon
from Consul McWade a.t Canton an
nouncing the success of the Chinese Im
perial troops in the operations againct
the Boxers. The action of the Southern
Chinese officials and the conduct of the
imperial troops are regarded as the best
obtainable evidence of the desire of tho
Chinese authorities to preserve the peace
and the successful destruction of the in
surgent organization should have a good
effect, it is thought here, upon the whole
of China an& Europe as -well. This Gov
ernment Is most anxious to expedite peace
neg-otiaticr.s ar.d in view of the fact that
all the powers have forthwith replied to
the French proposals It Is now urgent
that negotiators be designated to engago
in the rrciinur.ary exchange of views with
the Chinese commission. It will be nec
essary, of course, that further negotia
tions be conducted by the powers so as
to agree on the exact basis of negotia
tion?, but certain general .principles have
b*-<?n apreed on and it is not thought here
that these to which some powers have
taken exception will be insurmountable
obstacles in the way of the adoption of
a programme satisfactory to all inter
ested powers.
This Government has designated Minis
ter Conger to Â«r.ter into preliminary re
lations with the Chinese commission and
General Wi!Â«=on is being hold at Peking to
frn-o with him when permanent *-eac3
negotiations are begun. The Russian and
French Ministers have also been directed
to er.tcr into preliminary negotiations and

NEW YORK. Oct. 16. -William Jen
* nings Bryan of Nebraska. Demo
cratic candidate for President,
arrived In this city at 2:25 o'clock
to-day and received a real Tam
many welcome. His reception was an
emphatic ovation. As the train steamed
into the annex of the Grand Central sta
tion that part of the immense building
was thronged with a multitude. Mr.
Bryan was driven to the Hoffman House
in an open carriage, in which he sat next
to Richard Croker. and with uncovered
head bowed and smiled to the thousands
who cheered him. Forty-second street
presented an animated scene. From Lex
ington avenue on one side to Sixth avenue
on the other the sidewalks were lined with
the populace.
At 2:35 o'clock a loud cheer went up and
the open carriages containing the Tam
many Hall reception committee rode to
the annex. William R. Hearst led the
way, followed by Richard Croker, O. H.
P. Belmont (President of the borough).
James J. Coogan. James Shevlln. Lewis
Nixon, MorriS Delmour and about' a
dozen others. Three cheers for Croker
were given.
Mr. Bryan reached the Hoffman House
at 3:20 p. m. All the way down Fifth
avenue he was cheered by the big crowds
that lined the thoroughfare.
For hours before the time for the open
ing of the doors, 5:30 p. m., Madison
Square Garden, where Mr. Bryan was to
speak, was besieged by crowds. At 5:30
o'clock to the minute the sound of ex
ploding bombs outside the garden an
nounced the opening of the doors. In
stantly there was a great rush by the peo
ple from the Madison-avenue hallway and
from the Twenty-sixth-street., ejitrance*
which, according to police arrangements,
were to be tfept clear for ticket holders.
In the first ,rush were a few women, who
got near the speakers' stand. In less than
ten minutes every seat on the floor was
taken and the crowd, .which had begun
to pour in from all sides, attacked
the galleries. Five minutes later- saw
the balcony and a part of the galleries
black with people. The rush was then
over, but there came a steady stream
through the principal doors and all empty
s<?ats were soon filled.
The crowd did not appear at first to be
demonstrative. When the li?hts were all
turned on there came a brief cheer. The
big semi-circular tlectrical display over
the speakers' stand bore the portraits of
the two Democratic candidates, the Dem
ocrattc emblem and the Democratic
watchword, credited to Mr. Croker. "We
wish to remain free people," in great let
ters of light.
Warming Up the Crowd.
Then the band struck up a national air
and as the people recognized "Yankee
Doodle" they got up' In their seats with
uncovered heads and as they waved thou
sands of small American Hags shouted out
the words of the song.
The garden was decorated in the na
tional color* only. Streamers radiated
from the center, from the roof, under
neath the skylight to the heads of the
iron pillars over the galleries and festoons
of ilaps with the colors of different States
lined the galleries. The speakers' stand
was drapod simply with American flags
and red, white and blue bunting.
At 6:30 o'clock the only scats remaining
vacant in thv entire garden was an occa
sional box. the tickets for which remained
good until 7 o'clock The crowd was or
derly, and frequent performances by the
band brought out enthusiasm. The arri
val of prominent Tammany men brought
out the first strong applause of the even
ing As 7 o'clock approached, the hour
wbtn Mr. Bryan was expected to arrive,
the crowd becan to warm up. The garden
was Jammed, but the police kept the" aisles
fairly well cleared, and back of the gal
lery seats there was not an inch of avail
able space.
Mr. Bryan Enters.
Mr. Bryan entered the garden at 7:15
o'clock. As the face of Mr. Croker, be
hind which" appeared Mr. -Bryan's, was
seen the crowd burst forth in one gTeat
prolonged yell. Every one stood tiptoe on
his seat and the garden was a sea of wav
ing flags. As Mr. Bryan, escorted by Mr.
Croker, mounted the speakers' stand tho
cheering was continued. The two climbed
the stairs and made their way to the
front, followed by the reception commit
tee. Mr. Bryan and Mr. Croker frequently
responded to the cheering by bowing to
the vast audience, and the faces of both
were wreathed with smiles.
Just behind the two as they mounted
the platform. Mayor Van Wyck escorted
Edward M. Shepard, who acted as chair
man of the meeting. The cheering con
tinued, now dying down, now being re
newed with increased vigor. It continued
for five minutes." not abating when Mr.
Bryan rose to his feet and raised his
hands. Mr. Croker pulled him back Into
his seat. The cheering went on.
Mr. Croker rose, hesitated a moment,
then raised his hand for silence. Instead
of ceasing the crowd broke forth louder
than ever. ' Do what he could Mr. Croker
could not silence tne crowd.
After fully fifteen minutes of cheering
the applause began to' decrease. Mingled

CONGER TO MISSIONARIES.
It now appears that the Empress Dow
ager, taking- advantage of the late reign
of terror at Peking, and knowing Chang's
influence with the Emperor, ordered his
execution by decapitation. Chang was
considered by those familiar with his af
faire as one of the ablest men in China.
He had been decorated by the Queen of
Great Britain and by the Emperors ot
Russia and Germany. He was pre-emi
nently the most liberal and enlightened
of Chinese statesmen, and had his life,
been spared till the occupation of Peking
by the allies he doubtless would have
been recalled and have taken an active
part in the pending negotiations and fur
ther government of China.

crazy. It was the most dangerous outlook
of the evening and it seemed Â«s if scores
were to be trampled under foot. Repeat

carriage through, but every time the crowd,
came back. Night sticks were finally
drawn and a lane opened Ions enough to
let the Bryan carriage into Irving place.

up Broadway. Several hundred persons

WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â There were no Indian troubles in the Depart

difficulties between white men and Indians were individual, arising from cards,
and whisky. The white men, says the general, were . the aggressors. -In his
annual report General Merrlam states the disposition of his troops, and says:
"It will be observed that nearly all of the posts are placed^ on or In the
immediate vicinity of large reservations. The exceptionsâ Forts Douglass, D.
A. Russell and Loganâ are at important railroad centers, rendering their gar
risons quickly available for emergencies Which may arise."* .
The general speaks with commendation of .'the excellent progress being
made toward civilization by the Apaches under the management of Captain
Nicholson, Seventh Cavalry. He said: , , .
"I found them largely and successfully, engaged' In agriculture, and saw
large numbers, of men as well- as women at work .In" the fieldsâ most un
usual for Indians. I was told by railroad* officials that they could'not employ
better men for railroad labor. than these Apache Indians. 'In view of these
fact3 and of the assurance of Captain Nicholson of the absolute loyalty and
efficiency of his Indian -police I recommend the withdrawal of all the
troops from San Carlos agency, instead of repairing that post."

LANSFORD, Pa., Oct. 16.â About
1500 men and sixty women and
girls marched eighteen miles from
the south side of the Hazleton re
gion during the night for the
Panther Creek Valley, -where they ex
pected to close the ten collieries of the
Lehigh Coal and ; Navigation Company,
but just as the weary marchers wen;
nearing their destination this morning
they were met on a mountain road by
three companies of infantry and at the
point of the bayonet were driven back
four miles to Tamaqua and dispersed.
Another crowA of Â£00 strikers from the
north side of Hazleton also marched here
and succeeded in closing the company's
No. 1 colliery at Nesquehoning, near
Mauch Chunk, before it was scattered.
The presence of the soldiers was entirely
unexpected and the. strikers were much
crestfallen that they failed in accomplish
ing the object of their long march.
It was probably the most exciting morn
ing that the Panther Creek and the Nes
quehonlrg valleys have ever experienced.
Strikers wore scattered over the various
roads and companies of soldiers were
scurrying in all directions, heading off
the marching men. For a moment just
after the two forces met on the road in
the darkness it looked as if a clash would
come, but the good sense of those who
had charge of the strikers prevented a
conflict.
The march on Panther Creek Valley was
on the strikers' programme for several
days. The United' Mine Workers ever
since the strike started have been at
tempting to close the collieries of the
Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company In
this region. Organizers were constantly
in the region, but a.s a rule they did not
meet with much success, so it was de
cided to use stronger methods to get tho
men "employed in the ten mines out on
strike. Accordingly it was arranged that
a big demonstration should be held in the
'valley. .Â¦ It was to have been held yester
day morning, but owing to the heavy rain
and muddy roads it was called off until
this morning. Thoso who took part were
strikers from McAdoo, Yorktown, Bunker
Hill and Silver Brook, from the Fouth
side of Hazleton, and the Freeland, Drif-
The .strikers began to protest that- they
could not be stopped on a public highway
Â«nd many of them showed a disposition to
resist the soldiers. The officer in charge
of the troops, however ,~ kept his men in
Position and the strikers, seeing
that the soldiers evidently meant
business, slowly ' began to re-
"In the name of the people of the State
of Pennsylvania. I command you to dis
perse and to return whence you came."
At a point half a mile from Coaldal"
there is a sharp turn In the road and
as the newspaper men rounded it there
came a command of "halt!'.* and about
fifty feet in 'front of them stood solid
rows of soldiers, who were stretched
across the road with bayonets ! fixed
Sheriff Toole of Schuyiklll County was
with them. Tho commander of the troops,
speaking to the waiting crowd, said:
Carriages containing newspaper corre
spondents who had been trailing along at
the rear of the proc;>r-sion were requested
to lead, so they would not Interfere with
the plans of the strikers. Following the
newspaper m<?n came the two convey
ances containing the McAdoo women and
then followed a long line of Hungarians,
Italians, Poles, Slavs and English
speaking mine-workers.
The marchers came down like two ar
mies, the South Side men marchinjr hy

from the North Side went over the moun
tain at Beaver Meadow and entered the

were several life, and drum corps 'and a

girls were conveyed in two large omni
buses. The whole town of 'McAdoo Was
out to see the marchers start. Until 12
o'clock the night was very dark, it be
ing difficult to see any distance in the
mountain passes, but after midnight the
moon came out from behind a bank of
clouds and for the remainder of the
journey the marchers had plenty of light.
As the town of Tamaqua was efftered at
2 a. m. the strikers began, to make as
much noise as they could. The marchers

for rest and headed for Coaldale. four

Superintendent W. D. Zehner of the
company stated that if Sheriff Brislin of

Zehner said the remaining nine collieries

SECRET CONFERENCE HELD.
When the soldiers ha,d driven the strik
ers over the mountain- a company was
sent back to Coaldale, where the soldiers
bearded coal cars and were sent to Tama
qua to quell p.ny disturbance the scatter
ing strikers might stir up there. Further
along Â«t he road a company was deployed
to protect a -colliery while the marchers
were passing it. and later it was also sent
to Tamaqua. The three companies com
bined in the later town and soon had the
marchers well scattered. While all this
had been going on the North Side march
ers had everytning their own way in the
Nesquehoning Valley. . They reached
there after 2 o'clock and succeeded in pur
suading enougrh men to remain away from
the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Com
pany's No. 1 colliery to compel its shut
down. General Gobin sent two companies
of soldiers over there and soon had order
restored.
During all of this time the identity of
the troops was unknown, owing to the
darkness, and it was reported through the
crowd that they belonged to the Thir
teenth Regiment of Scranton. The sol
diers were really members of the Fourth
Regiment, which has been stationed at
Shenandoah for three weeks. Eight com
panies of the regiment left Shenandoah at
12:30 a. m., leaving two companies behind.
Brigadier General Gobin was in command.
On their arrival at Coaldale, three com
panies, under command of Colonel O'Neill,
were sent out to .meet the South Side
marchers. Three companies were left at
Coaldale. while ! two companies, under
command of General Gobin, came here.

action of the troops !n stopping the
marchers, but she. was shut oft! and or
dered to move on. The McAdoo women
had to be almost pushed along, so slowly
did they walk. They continually Jeered
at the soldiers, calling them all kinds of
names and threatening them with pun
ishment if they should dare to visit Mc-
Adoo. It took from 3 to after 6 o'clock
to drive the crowd back to Tamaqua.
SCRANTON. Pa., Oct. 16.â The Gibbons
Coal Company's colliery in South Scran
ton is being put in order for work and the
company says it will begin operations to
morrow or next day surely. This com
pany has agreed to grant the strikers' de
mands if the strike is raised, and further
that it will only mine enough ccal to fill
its contract with the school district. Dis
trict Secretary Dempsey. of the United
Mine Workers said to-day that the board
had not acted on the matter, but that in
all likelihood the request of the company
will be granted.
The Delaware and Hudson. Company's
two washerles at Carbondale and Olym
pant have resumed operations after an
idleness extending a month beyond the
beginning of the strike.
A Hungarian laborer who went to work
at the Carbondale washery was badly
beaten in a saloon. He was not able to

WILL RESTJME OPERATIONS.
It was long after nightfall when the
first of the strikers who marched to
Panther Creek Valley returned. .They
were, for the most part, footsore and
weary. The distance of eighteen miles
from Hazleton to Coaldale is principally
down grade, and the walk there was
scarcely noticed by the strikers. The up
hill march home, however, with the added
facts of a sleepless night, and a failure
to accomplish their purpose, tended to
dampen their ardor somewhat.
This was an exceedingly quiet day
around the headquarters of - the United
Mine Workers. President Mitchell spent
most of the day in disposing of the mail,
which had accumulated during the miners'
convention last week. Air. Mitchell said
he had received no communication or even
an intimation that the operators would
accept. .the proposition made by the con
vention.
HAZLETON, Pa., Oct. 16.â The report

nied that he had done so, but said he and
Governor Stone had talked on the advisa
bility of having soldiers in this region.
It is Mr. Pardee's belief that if troop3

peace and preventing marches. Mr. Par

LONDON. Oct. 17.â "I would give every
penny I have anil begin again at the bot
tom of the ladder to lift the America's
cup." .
Thus spoke Sir. Thomas Llpton with
characteristic earnestness and frankness
when talking yesterday afternoon about
his second challenge for the trophy, which
he believes he will bring back to England.
Sir Thomas took the defeat of the Sham
rock very much to heart, for he was firm
ly convinced that she was a better boat
than the Columbia, and that she should
win under ordinary circumstances. But
Sir Thomas accepted the reverse -like <i
true sportsman and did not seek to make
any excuses. When the Shamrock II ia
fitted out for her voyage to America Sir
Thomas will make use of the knowledge
gained in handling the first ShamrocK.
He will intrust his new, yacht to new
skippers.
If in their hands she fails to "lift" the
cup Six Thomas wil\ concede that ..it
Americans have no peers as yacht, build
ers.
"I take off my .hat to the Herresnoffs."
said Sir Thomas yesterday. "They -arc
wonderful men. I would give all I havo
to build on this side of the water a craft
better than they can produce. If money
can build a yacht superior to the Her
reshoft boat then I will bring the cup
back to England.
"I want no fairer course than the Sandy
Hook course.
"My challenge is possibly the shortest
ever sent to America. . No conditions are
attached except a request aa to the time
when the races shall be held.".

SAN JOSE, Oct. 16.â The ladles of
the Eastern Star have captured
the Garden City and there will be
a reign of gayety in San Jose the
balance of the week. All of to
day's trains brought large numbers of
delegates and mnre are expected to-mor
row. When the Grand Chapter was called
to order in Home Union Hall about 300
delegates were present.
This evening the visitors were tendered
a reception in St. James Hotel Music Hall.
This was but the beginning of the hos
pitality and entertainment to be extended
by San Jose Chapter. The place was
crowded by the elite of the city and
a' hearty greeting was extended to the
guests. Jui^e Hyland delivered an ad
dress of welcome. A tine musical pro
gramme was rendered, followed by re
freshments and dancing.
The twenty-eighth annual session of .the
Grand Chapter of the Order of the East
ern Star, which comprises California and
Nevada, promises to be an Important one.
The Grand Chapter did little more than
effect organization this afternoon. The
delegates were slow in assembling and it
was 2:30 o'clock when Dr. Lawrence,
past grand patron, called the convention
to order. He delivered a short address.
All of the grand ofilcers were present
and In their places, as follows: George
Darling, worthy grand patron; Mrs. Fan
nie T. McCowan, worthy grand matron;
Charles Corbler, associate grand patron;
Mrs. Lulu Lucas, associate grand matron;

once took up their work. Grand Secre
tary Â¦ Kate J. Willats presented her an
nual report. It showed 158 chapters in
the jurisdiction, with a membership of
more .than 12/100. During the year 1103

REDDING. Oct. 16.â Interview*
with many delegates to tht
Grand Encampment of Odd Fel
lows, now 'n session In this city
show that Fresno is in the lead
and is almost certain to be designated as
the meeting pla^e of the next Grand En
campment. At the tl.ae when Redding
obtained the honor Fresno was its most
formidable opponent. Merced, Modesto.
Paso Robles and Eureka are strong candl
dates, but the indications point to their
defeat.
At to-day's session of the Grand En
campment nominations for grand ofilcers,
for which the election occurs to-morrow,
were made as follows: For grand patri
arch x. D. Gummoe of Grass Valley;
grand high priest, C. H. Weaver of Ala
mecia; grana senior warden, A. C. Bates
of San Jose; grand scribe, William H.
Barnes of San Francisco; grand treas
urer, Henry C. George; grand representa
tive, Joseph Foster of San Francisco;
grand trusteesâ H. S. Winn, \V. S. Pot
ter and F. A. Week.
For grand junior warden there are no
less than six candidates in the field â W.
H. Wocdbridge of Stockton, James Ash
man of Los Angeles, John A. Foster of
San Francisco, George Jcssen. W. E. Du
bois of San Francisco and Louis Moore of
Redding. At this time it Is difficult to say
which has the best chance of election.
The friends of Louis Moore are working
hard in the interest of their candidate, as
it Is a matter of sectional pride to have
Northern California represented among
the grand officers.
Nothing further than organization was
effected at the morning session of the en
campment. In the afternoon the encamp
ment convened in secret session. At 4
o'clock a military council was called at
Odd Fellows' Hall.
There were not many arrivals of dele
gates to-day. Four hundred are already
here. Of these 250 are officers and mem
bers of the Grand Encampment, the rest
being members of the subordinate lodges.
Ample provisions have been made for the
accommodation of all Odd Fellows who
may come to town, but other visitors are
not so fortunate. The accommodations
are here, but in the absence of commit
tees to look after strangers they iind it
difficult to find lodgings. The cantons and
drill corps that have arrived' and are
either encamped or have quarters in the
town are as follows:
Canton No. 15 of Stockton, Captain Wil
liam Bruce, 21 members.
Rebokah Drill Corps No. 1 of Stockton,

A large numbtr of delegates spent the
dav In driving to various points of inter
est. The Sar. Francisco Patriarchs Mili
tant band serenaded the town.
On Thursday the drill corps contests
Â¦will take place. On Friday all the dole
gates will have a much coveted oppor
tunity to visit the great copper smelting
plant of the Mountain Copjper Company
at Keswick. six milts from Redding. Gen
eral Manager Lewis T. Wright of the
copper company has placed a special train
at the disposal of the delegates for a ride
over the picturesque Iron Mountain Rail

mine twelve miles distant.

The collision occurred at night on Sep

answered by the Ise Maru. The vessels
mistook one another's signals, and the
captain of the Ise Maru says the Colando

'ine Chinese pay $25 each, or only $10
apiece If the party is a large one, while
the Japanese are given a map and the di
rection of the sun at noon for the modest j
sum of Jo. The Japanese are usually j
strung out In a long line, sometimes a
quarter of a mile from one another, and
each shows the succeeding tine the trail
by marking the tre^s on either side of the |
path. Thus they get throuf?h,Â»-and if one
Happens to be captured the others have
time to get away. It takes three days to
make the trip, traveling at night and
sleeping in the daytime.
It was reported this morning from
Stevrston that three Chinese were
drowned two nights ago near the boun
dary line at Point Roberts. A revenue
launch on patrol nearly ran down their
craft-, which had been watched for some
tim<\ When the Chinese saw that they
could not get away they pulled the plugs,
In the bottom of the boat and threw
themselves overboard. About $1209 worth
of opium was found stowed In the sink
ing craft.
All of the Chinese who illegally cross
the boundary carry from five to. ten
pounds of opium. There are several opium
factories In j Vancouver, and the poppy
product Is smuggled In small boats j
around to Blalne and VVhatfom.
The real trouble lies, according to the
custom* officers who were Interviewed to
day. Â» n the laxity of the immigration laws
of Canada. The Orientals know they can
not land directly in the States and they
come through Canada simply to find the
easiest route to the desired point in the
States. Canadian laws are complained of
es being lax Jn other particulars, for no
punishment can be Inflicted upon the
guides, who live on this side of the line

VANCOUVER. Oct. 16. -Three hundred
and fifty Chinese, fifty Japanese and
thousands of dollars' worth of opulm
have been smuggled from Canada into
the United States on an average each
month for nearly a year, according to dis
coveries made to-day by the American
agents of the Immigration Department at
the boundary line. The smugKllng has
been carried on despite the utmost vigil
ance of the officials, but so extensive Is
the open boundary line that a thorough
scrutiny is impossible. American officials
recently redoubled their, efforts to arrest
smugglers and smuggled Orientals. Dur

while endeavoring to cross the boundary,
but it was only during the last few days
that the extent of the system was ascer
tained. Now every effort is being made to
cope with it.
R. G. Tatlow, member of Parliament
for Vancouver, obtained the first clew to
the illegal operations at the boundary.
The details he gave have blen Investi
gated and are found by the American of
ficials to be practically correct. Most of
the Chinese are taken through in parties
of fronj ten to twenty. There are in all a
score of roads and trails across and
Â»round Mount Baker^ between Chilliwack
and Whateom. Only six are watched,
and even these are insufficiently guarded.
So nicely has the underground railroad
system been worked that well drawn
maps, containing plans of all trails and
roads are supplied to men going across
tne line, so that there is no possibility of
their losing their way. The guarded roaas
are marked and the secret paths are out
lined, so that fully two-thirds of the tÂ»o0
or 700 Japanese and Chinese who try to
get through each month are successful in
their endeavors. While the Chinese are
taken through in large parties under the
personal supervision of Canadian guides,
the Japanese are usually sent through by

done to crockery and glassware. The
Alaska Commercial Company lost $200
worth of drugs. The North American
Company at Wood Island suffered dam
age to breakable goods. Its big whart at

their houses, crying and praying, and
eould not be pacified. The natives, espe
cially, were terrified, thinking the last
day had come. In all twenty-seven dis
tinct shocks were felt within six hours
and the earth was in an almost constant
tremor during the entire time. The vi
brations were from east to west and were
accompanied by a low, rumbling noise.

tut . International de Sociologie had
elected him an associate member at Its
annual congress. Considering 1 the fact
that there are only five other members of
this society in the United States and that
only two of these are teachers of sociol
ogy. It will be seen that Dr. Ross' selec
tion is a marked distinction. . It comes
as a surprise to Dr. Ross, as It was both
unexpected and unsolicited. Said he to
dav:
'*l was very much surprised to hear of
my selection as a member of this dis
tinguished society. Though I have writ
ten some on*sociological subjects. I hard
ly considered my contributions more than
articles and did not know that they had
attracted any notice abroad. The subject
of sociology has Interested me very much
and I had hoped to make a more sub
stantial contribution to the science at
some future time. However, my election
to membership will hardly deter me from
this resolution."
Dr. Ross, who has also attained a na
tional reputation as an economist. Is yet
a young man. He graduated from Coe
College. Indiana, in 18*6, and took his
doctor's degree from Johns Hopkins Uni

LONDON, Oct. 16. â After a searching- Inquiry into the running 1 of the American horse Escurlal at Newmarket, October

Suspicion had been cast on Lester Relff. the jockey, owing to Escurlal losing, though he had been confidently ex
pected to win. The stewards say that although they are not altogether satisfied, they do not consider the evidence
sufficient to prove the horse was pulled or to justify the withdrawal of Reiff's license.

no appeal should be made this year. But
when the Polycllnic benefit does come it
is bound to create a sensation. The ladies
have all sorts" of plans and a big vaude
ville show with society talent is one of
the thlnps that they are whispering about.
When the benefit does come off the pro
ceeds will be devoted to enlarging the
present home of the Polyclinic.
IT was a great day with the ladies of
the Polycllnlc yesterday and the
ladies made the best of it, combining
business and pleasure in that par
ticular way of theirs for which they
are famous.
A charming- breakfast at the Occidental
was the pleasure end of the day and
that delightful function served a three
fold purpose. First, a welcome home to
the president. Mrs. M. H. de Young; sec
ond, the celebration of the tenth anni
versary of the founding of the Polycllnio.
and third, the inauguration of the new
board 4 of lady directors.
The breakfast was a most delightful
affair. A delicious menu was served at
a round table made beautiful with pink
roses urewn with an artistic* carelessness
on the snowy white damask. Silver can
delabra, in which burned pink candles,
shaded in silver, shed a soft light over
the pretty scene. Seated at table were:
Mrs. M. H. de Young, president; Mrs. I.
Hecht. first " vice president; Mrs. T. G.
Walkington, second vice president; Miss
Adelaide Pollock, corresponding secre
tary; Mrs. Lewis Meycrstein, treasurer,
and the following directors. Mrs. J. B.
Stetson, Mrs. Harry Gray, Mrs. Andrew
M. Davis, Mrs. G. T. Davis. Mrs. L. Lil-
Us, Mrs. S. S. Kahn. Mrs. ii Elkus, Mrs.
W. D. O'Kane, Mrs. Martin Regensburger
and Mrs. Ed Rothchild.
Not the- le.ist of the deliphts of the
breakfast were the toasts offered and the
happy responses they brought forth. Mrs.
T. G. Walkington was chairman and
toastmistress and she filled the duties of
her post with tact and prace. Her ad
dress of welcome to the gue.^t of honor
was a gracious and charming little speech.
Mrs*, de Young responded to* Mrs. Walk-

ONE BUSY YEAR
FOR THE REd
CROSS SOCIETY
His wlf3, who was Lucille Blackburn,
had a narrow escape from death by a
pistol wound about three years ago. Mrs.
Lane kept a loaded revolver in her bureau
drawer and one night she was found in
her room with a bullet wound in her
breast. It was explained by the family
that in taking some laces from the drawer
the pistol had been lifted up and falling
on the hammer exploded. She lingered
between life and death for some time..but
ultimately recovered. The shock of last
night's tragedy completely prostrated her
and she Is now under the constant care
of a physician.
Senator Blackburn was In Hagerstown.
Md., last night wlien the news of the sui
cide roached him. He had been on a cam
paign tour of the State. .He left as soon
as possible -for Washington, and it Is
likely that the occurrence will force him
to abandon any further active work In
the campaign.
Mr. Lane was the American representa
tive of the London firm of Vickers' Sons
& Maxim. It is said that he. was driven
to the act by brooding over his ill health.
He was told some time ago that he had
Bright's disease and he allowed the mat
ter to prey on his mind.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â Thomas F.
Lancgon-in-law of ex-Senator Blackburn,
committed suicide at his home here List
night. Mr. Lane entered the house about
11 p. m. and shot himself in the presence
of his little daughter, while his wife was
resting on a*couch In an adjoining room-
Death was almost instantaneous.
Deceased Was the Son-in-Law of Sen
â¢ ator Blackburn and Had Long
BeÂ«n Brooding Over His
Ill-Health.
Shoots Himself in the Pres
ence of His Little
Daughter.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a discov-
ery of great value to the medical profes- j
sion and the public. They are an unfall- 1
Ing specific In all cases of dyspepsia and j
disordered digestion.
Almost everybody's digestion Is dis- j
ordered more or less, and the commonest !
thing they do for Jt Is to take some one !
of the many so-called blood purifiers, I
which in many cases are merely stronp j
cathartics. Such things are not needed. '
If the organs are In a clogged condition, j
they need only a little help and they will
right themselves. I Cathartics irritate the j
sensitive linings of the stomach and !
bowels and often do more harm than )
good.
Purging Is not what Is needed. The I
thing to do is to put the food In con- i
dition to be readily digested and assiml- ;
lated. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet3 do
this perfectly. They partly digest what !
is eaten and give the stomach just the Â¦
help it needs. They stimulate the secre-
tion and excretion of the digestive fluids I
and relieve the congested condition of the |
glands and membranes. They put the i
â¢whole digestive, system in condition to do j
Its work. When that Is done you need '
take no more tablets, unless you eat what '
does not agree with you. Then take one '
or two tablets^-give them needed help and
you will have no trouble.
It's a common-sense medicine and a com-
mon-sense treatment and it will cure
every time. Not only cure the disease,
but cure the cause. Goes about it in a
perfectly sensible and scientific way.
We"have testimonials enough to fill a
book, but we don't publish many of them
Howeverâ
Mrs. E. M. Faith of Byrds Crpek Wls
says: I have taken all the Tablets I go't
of you and they have done their work well
In my case, for I feel like a different person
altogether. I don't doubt If I had not got
them I should have been at rest bv this
time.
H. E. "Wlllard. Onslow. Iowa, says- Mr
White of Canton was telling me of your
Dyspepsia Tablets curing him of dvspep-
sla, from which he had suffered for eight
years. As I am a sufferer myself. 1 wNh
you to send me a package by return man
Phil Brooks, Detroit. Mich., says- Your
dyspepsia cure has worked wonders In my
case. I suffered for years from dyspepsia
but am now entirely cured and enjoy life
as I never have before. I gladly recom-
mend them.
It will cost 50 cents to find out just how
much Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
help you. Try themâ that's the best way
to decide. . *
All druggists sell them. A little book
on stomach diseases will be mailed free

Dr. Meyers & Co, TO?
In answer to a reporter's Inquiry yester-
day Dr. Movers & Co.'s manager made
the following statement:
"We owe our remarkable success chierly
â¢to our remedies and methods. These em-
bot-y the most Important discovers.*
j which have been made by physicians and
i scientists in both the old and new worUIs.
I from the dawn of light on tho dark agtÂ»
' down to the present time.
; 'â¢The specialists of our institution do not
cast away an old remedy which has been,
used successfully in curing am! restoring
men. simply because it is not modern.
They are. however, on the aiert for new
| discoveries ard turn such to practical use
j as soon as proved to be t of value.
"Men seekin? health and strength,
j should not be misled by so-called new
discoveries which are so frequently ad-
vertlstd, and which are usually as worth-
less as free trial treatments. Eastern
quacks, electric belts and similar swindles.
A cure-all that is new, just discovered.
etc., cannot be anything but an experl-
] ment. Years are required to thoroughly
! test a cure or a restorative.
"The great majority of the many thou-
I sands of men we have cured owe their
I health and strength to the remedies an.l
appliances which have never . failed us
during the past 20 years. In addition to
these important aids, we have ample cap-
ital to equip and maintain our large in-
Btltution. AVe do not consider expenses
i when buying medicines, appliances, etc.
! The best that wise judgment can select
' and that money can purchase. In Europe
I or America, have been secured and ard
added to from time to time.
"Our physicians are all regular gradu-
! ates from the best medical colleges in tha
land. They have had many years' experi-
ence In hospitals, in general practice and
as specialists. We do not send our pa-
tients to high priced drug stores wherq
their prescriptions may be carelessly
filled, but we supply all medicines neces-
sary to effect a cure from our own pri-
vate laboratories, FREE OF COST. This
department is under tho direct supervision
of competent pharmacists.
"The two surgeons of our institution,
perform operations when absolutely neces-
sary, but we avoid the use of the knife
as much as possible. Among other ail-
ments, we cure lost manhood, wasting
drains, unnatural losses. *-tc. private dis-
eases. Including contagious blood polscns.
also va'ricocple. hydroc^le. diseases of tho
kidneys, bladder, spine, etc.
"Our home curp department has been in

DRAWING TO A CLOSE
States He Will Meet His Creditors
To-Day and Make Them an .
Offer.
The creditors of the United States
Fruit Packing Company held a meeting
yesterday afternoon in the office of T. D.
Rlordan. A sensational incident was
sprung in the early session by Sol Jacobs,
president of the company. He stated that
he had transferred about JSCOO worth of
tho stock to his brother-in-law, Morris
Levin- and that he had transferred tho
plant to his mother-in-law. This was a
knockout blow/to the creditors, who up
to yesterday were under the impression
that the shares of the company were in
tact in the hands of President Jacobs.
Some of the creditors became very in
dignant and stated that unless Jacobs
would to-day make them a proposition in
which they would realize at least some re
turns for their loss they would commence
bankruptcy proceedings.
Jacobs stated that he would see his
mother and try to offer them some sort
of. compromise, but if they would give
him s=ix months' more time that he felt
he could repay them dollar for dollar.
S. JACOBS TRANSFEBBED
STOCK TO RELATIVES
The report shows that the output of
young fish from the State hatcheries dur
ing the last two years amounted to twtn
ty-three and a half million salmon fry
and eleven million trout fry. In speaking
of tho results; reached since the commis
sion was created in 1S70 the report says:
It Is now thirty years since this commission
was established. It owes Its creation to the
Kood Judgment and foresight of a few men
who early appreciated the possibilities of flsh
propagation and fish culture in the diversified
waters of the State. They fully realized that
proper attention, protection and propagation
of the finny tribe would maintain a lasting
and everlasting supply of nutritious food to
our people, and that the Increasing settlement
of our State with the subsequent development
of our mineral and agricultural resources would
have a tendency to decrease the spawning area
of anadromous flsh and that artificial hindrance
of a natural propagation must be made and
overcome by atrtlficial or protective breeding.
They knew that so long as flsh food was cheap
and abundant the prices of their animal foods
would be lower If this substitute was at han.i.
They understood that the people In their
sovereign, capacity were the owners of all flah
in public waters and that they could not be
surrendered to private ownership and that their
preservation was a duty which devolved upou
the State.
The hopes of its founders are to be realized
each day in irreater measure. It is safe to
say that California has never known a com
mission that has rendered such good returns,
for' the small annual expenditure as has its
flsh commission. ...
Through the efforts of the board the delicious
and abundant shad and striped bass, which are
the food of the wealthy of other States, now
come cheaply to the humblest of our citizens.
If the commission In thirty years had accom
plished onthing further than the Introduction
and -propagation of these two species it has
Justified the expenditures that the State has
made In Its support, i By the efforts of this
board the salmon has been saved to this State.
The decrease of the spawning area and the
encroachments of civilization would have long
since put this "king of fishes" among the
creatures that were If the efforts of the State
had not supervened to save It. It has been
maintained in full supply and the board hopes
each year that it may be Increased to some
thing like its pristine abundance.
It may not be out of place to reiterate that
The sixteenth biennial report of the
State Board of Fish Commissioners was
forwarded to the Governor yesterday by
Chief Deputy John P. Babcock.. It is a
lengthy document and contains matter of
interest to the fisherman and also those
who never angled for the finny denizens
of the water. It reviews the work accom
plished by the commission from Septem
ber 1. 189S, to September 1, 1900. Attention
is called to the Increased, public interest
in the work of the board, which Is grati
fying to its members. Mr. Babcock states
that the supply of food fishes has been
abundant and that the run of salmon has
been slightly above the average. He also
says that the pack of salmon in 1900 was
the largest In ten years, and that the ex
port of fishery products from San Fran
cisco for 189S amounted to $2,113,763 and for
11<00 to $2,6S5,712.
The methods In use by the Chinese fish
ermen are shown to be most disastrous
and the necessity of a change in the law
is pointed out. The destruction wrought
by sealions is clearly shown and the ef
forts made by the board to reduce their
numbers are given in detail. The work of
the late game convention is reviewed and
the bill framed by it or some mere strin
gent measure is recommended. *The re
port is a lone and interesting document,
but it is not likely to see publication until
after the Legislature meets, as the print
ing appropriation of the commission Is
exhausted.
The work of the United States Fish
Commission in the State is highly cdm
mended. and the assistance rendered the
board by game associations In different
counties Is acknowledged. The present
salmon law Is advocated at length arid the
necessities which led to Its passage are
reviewed, it being shown that the repeal
or amendment of the present law would
work disastrously to the most valuable
fishery In the State.
The Commissioners In reply to the often
repeated question, "What do you do to
ward the enforcement of the laws?" pre
sent a table showing that 525 persons wrre
arrested for violation of the fun and game
laws, of which number 104 entered plea^
of guilty, St> were convicted. W) acquitted.
76 have their cases still pending and 62
were discharged. The total of lines Im
posed Is shown to be $5779. It is also shown
that $11,300 worth of illegally possessed
fish and over 2500 game birds were seized,
all of which were donated to public chari
ties.
the successful administration of this trust Is
made possible and Is In fact guaranteed by
the attention of our corps ot trained and
efficient men. For many years the salaried
officers and employes of this commiMlon have
been secure In their employment. re?ardle*a
of changing of administration and regardless
of all considerations save honesty. Industry
and efficiency.
It was announced that on November 12
the Pacific Coast Manufacturers' and Job
bers' Association will meet In this city.
The coast association Is composed of the
executive committees of all the city asso
ciations. One of its most important items
of business at the next meeting will be

CHARGE OF EMBEZZLEMENT
Appeal From Extradition Order Dismissed
in Circuit Court of Appeals.
"I am authorized by Mr. Irving, who is absent from the city, to say that the Paraffine Paint Company will donate $1000 to the Gal
veston sufferers if the S. E. Slad? Lumber Company and the San Francisco Timber Preserving Company will submit their cash and check books
for the year 1897 to a committee to be appointed by the editors of the morning papers, provided this committee be permitted to publish the items
therein contained which show the financial transactions between said companies and the then members of the Board of Harbor Commissioners, and
also any alterations and mutilations in connection with such items." â Excerpt from interview with Attorney W. B. Cope In reference to harbor front
andals.
AS the foregroing remarks clearly
indicate Attorney Frederick S.
Stratton has ptirrfd up a hor
nets" nest by his communication
to the Harbor Commissioners
In reference to the suits of the Paraffine
Faint Company and Samuel C. IrvinR
drains! the board- In this communication
Mr. Stratton took occasion to criticize
Judgre Belcher very severely and to assert
that while the plaintiffs won the suit they
abandoned all benefits which they won by
their litigation.
"W. B. Cope, one of the attorneys for
the plaintiffs, now makes reply with the
Etartlir.g ailegatior.s which so seriously
reflect upon the Harbor Commissioners
who were In office when the suits were in
6titute<l. Mr. Cope does not care to em
bellish cr elaborate his assertion, but the
offer of his principals to donate a thou
sand dollars if the books of the S. E. Sladv.-
Lumber Company and the San Francisco
Timber Preserving Company are submitted
for public inspection is deeply signincant.
Mr. CÂ«-.pe returned from the country
yesterday and was bristling with allega
tions and uncomplimentary remarks of
Attorney Stratton. whom he handled ut
terly without concern or consideration for
that gentleman's feelings. Mr. Cope in-
FistP that his principals in the litigation
facrificed nothing of value. He declares
that they won everything that they could
possibly obtain and pave up the crsts ot
tuit simply that The settlement might be
hastened. It will be interesting Co note
vhetht-r or not the S. E. Slade Lumber
Company or the San Francisco Timber
Pi-pservtnp Company care to submit their
books for the period specified and secure
a donation <>f one thousand dollars for the
cofferers of Galveston.

Fiat* Harbor Cr^-.misFinners in reference to

fcj-HXT tv>ar>5 by the ParafSr.e l'aint Comeany
air! ?arr.ue! C. Irvir.p was called to my atten
t - OB my return fr^m the rountry- I havÂ»
r Â¦' \i >i an opportunity to examine the report
er.3 can Â¦Â¦â¢!*.!>â¢ Kp^ak from the quotatior-.s made
5t Tbe Call. My only reaym for speaklr.K at
Â«:: if Th:it Jnie^ Belcher, whose fairness and
Judicial conduct are directly assailed In the
Â¦ r< port, probably feels restrained by a ser.se of
â¢ dignity ar.d Judicial propriety from making a
\ reply in person to an uncalled for. malicious,
: ur.jii't an.l in many particulars untrue attack.
The attack rn Judge Belcher by this dis
' b i untied attorney cannot 1Â»Â» excused upon the
i ground that It. was nn >>Â¦Â¦! J in the p*-rform
a;ice of his duty. No report of the settlement
\ wrs necessary, tor the reason thet the board
j knew as well as Mr. Strattoii. and had pre
\it.ufly consented to. the terms of the settle
j nent and authorized him to make It. But
i even if rome report were proper to close the
: matter before the board there was certainly no
! reason why Mr. Stratton should have taken
1 the occasion to criticize and abuse the Judije.
j That the lonK-pendinp litigation between the
Parainne Faint Company and the members of
! the former Board of Harbor Commissioners
| had been settlrd by the agreement of all par
ties concerned, with the active co-operation of
Mr. Stratu.n, is true: but that the Parafflne
IV.ir.T. Companv has relinQu:Eh'*Â«l in that ytttle-
I rrent one item of the b^netlts for which it
! crntended in the litigation is absolutely talse.
Purposes of the Suit.
i The Parafflne Paint Company's suit was In
1 flituted for the purpose of compelling the
1 Hoard of State Harbor Commissioners to award
a contract tor mating piles to be used In
t Gree:i-s:reet wharf, and also for the treatment
j ot such pile* as mijrht be called for br the
i b^ard for one year from the month of Kovem
! ber, 1*?7. The time consumed In the trial and
subsequent procoedingE rendered a contract for
or* year of no value. As stated in Mr. Strat-
I ton** communication, the conttact fcr Green
, street wharf was awarded to the Para: fine
Â¦ Paint Company in compliance with the Judg
] ment. Mr. Stratton seemed to be very anxious,
I ftr soir.e reason, to perfect an appeal, and in
i r-ritr to enable him to do so the attorneys for
I the company consented to the entry of a Judg
ment in a form prepared, if 1 am not mistaken.
i by Mr. Strattcn himself, or at any rate rag
j gf-frtPd by him.
The contract for the matins of plies for one
year was nÂ»ver regarded by the company as o'
any value whatsoever, as Mr. Stratton well
knows, and there has never been a time when
it would not wil'.lr.ply have relinquished that
part of the judgment. The only other benefits
relinquished in the settlement were the costs.
In the Paraffine ca.ee th<?se coats amounted to
or-Ir a few dollars, and In the Irving case to
about $250. The cofts in the Irving c\5e were
not relinquished because Mr. Irving was not
entitled to them, but because their collection
would have caused furthor delay in the >Â»Â«-ttle
ment. and pot^lhly might have prevented It and
subjected the company to a continuance of the
litigation for no practical purpose, and at th"
probable expense of ton times the amount of
the roftf. As another result of the settlement,
apparently not rcftrre<J to by Mr. Stra.tt.in In
his report, the Paraffine Paint Company recov-
ered from the Board of State, Harbor Commis
sioners its certified check for $1000, being four
times tho amount of the costs.
The Questions Involved.
I am not inclined to dircuss the questions In
volved in the litication. The readers of The
fall will perhaps remember that the cases In
volved charges of gross fraud and favoritism
In the dealings of the former board with cer
tain contractors, one of whom was admittedly
a client of Mr. Stratton and advised by him in
certain business matters with the board which
came directly Into consideration on the trial.
That the opinion of Judge Belcher, which was
published at 'length in Tho Call of April 24.
1S9S. refrained from any criticism of Mr. Strat
ton htmsolf was a matter which should have
excited his lively gratitude instead of planting
In his breast a spirit of malevolence which,
aftf-r long cherishing, seems now to have burst
forth. Indeed, I am credibly Informed that
ilr. Stratt&n shortly after took the trouble to
peck Judge Belcher at his chambers and thank
htm profusely for his consideration in not re
flectinjr upon him (Stratton). and added that
the honor would nover be forgotten.
As to the manner in which the trial was
conducted. I remember very distinctly that at
the outset technical objections were raised by
Mr. Stratton to the Introduction of any testi
mony on the part of the plaintiffs and the
Judge seemed strongly inclined to sustain Mr.
Stratton's objections.
It required, in order to get in any
evidence, a long and warm argument,
in which the counsel for the Paraffine
Paint Company promised that if per
mitted to introduce the testimony
they woud show that the business of
the Harbor Commissioners ! on the
water front had been conducted with j
gross favoritism and even corruption, j
This promise was abundanty justified !
by the subsequent testimony wrung j
from the unwilling lips of witnesses
deeply concerned in the transactions
under investigation, and from books
of account marred with recent eras
ures and containing fictitious entries
of charges to imaginary Battersons,
Mattersons and Rattersons.
T'pon fuoh a statemer.t it was no wonder that
an upright Judse, with a desire to brine the
truth to light, should have decided to hear the
testimony and determine afterward, upon care
ful consideration, how much of It was relevant
and what portion should be caBt aside. That
this Is no unusual practice In the trial of cases
before a court, where there is no Jury In at
tendance. Is well known to lawyers and to
others familiar with legal proceedings. Par
ticularly Is this so where It Is sought to prove
fraud, as the parties guilty of fraud usually
are careful to cover up their tracks.
Mr. Stratton'rf Complaint.
The real gravamen of Mr. Stratton's com
plaint Is not that the testimony did not ills
close corruption and favoritism, but that the
testimony was not "relevant," which means
simply that. In the opinion of this biased
critic of an unbiased court. It -was not con
nected closely enough with the so-called tech
nical Issues In the case. That It was "rele
vant" in a broader sense Is shown by the fact
that it convinced not only the court, but the
great intelligent public to whom it was re
peated through the columns of the dally papers,
of the Justice of the Parafflne Paint Company's
cause. It was the publicity given to the tes
timony which disturbed the peace of mind of
the Individuals whose methods were thus, for
the first time, disclosed.
It Is not true that the Judge was responsible
for any delays, either In reference to the entry
of the Judgments or the settlement of the bill
of exceptions. The bill of exceptions prepared
In Mr. Stratton's office was. In the opinion
of counsel for the Parafflne Paint Company,
unnecessarily and ridiculously lengthy. The
priming of it would have been a Kreat expense
to tbe sitate. and we prepared several hundred
amendments designed principally to reduce the
bulk Of the bill.
I was not aware that the trial Judge had
manifested any irr.patleme or objection to the
defendant's appealing from his decisions; but
if he did have such feelinRS and did state that
the questions Involved were merely academic,
I can quite understand his disgust at the con
duct of attorneys for public officers who would
ho willing to subject the State to a very heavy
expenditure of money, including attorneys'
fees. In maklnc up records and arguing ap
pealai the result of which could be of no ad
vantage whatsoever to the State.
One of Mr. Stratton's detentions on the trial
was that no matter how corrupt the Commls-
Monors may have been, there was no power
in the courts to regulate their conduct. Judge
Uelchcr held acalnst this contention, and his
declMon was at the time regarded by honest
contractors as Â«. decided advantage for those
who wished to compete for public work upon ati
equal footine without favoritism.
I desire to Bay that there Is no member or
the itcspM Hoard of riarbor Commissioners
whose conduct was attacked In the litigation,
and that there was nothing In the evidence
or in th<? decisions that would reflect in any
way upon those who are now on the board.
S. C. Irving Will Give $1000 if Two Prominent Firms Will Submit the
Record of Their Transactions With the Harbor Commission
to an Inspection Committee.

EDITOR OF THE CALL: The remarkable story recently telegraphed
here by a New York yellow Journal of the killing of a long-lost son and the
disappearance of his father, a well-known army officer, has caused a great
deal' of amusement in local army circles. In 1S72 Major Rockefeller, then
lieutenant, was, so the story poes, stationed at Hongkong. A wife and child
were with him. Completing his tour of duty, the officer made arrangements
to return to this country. A few days before leaving his child disappeared
and no trace was ever found of him. Twenty-two years after, so the story
ran, the officer, with the rank of major, was sent to the Philippines and In
an attack shot and killed a white youth, who was leading the natives in an
attack. This youth was supposed to be the long-lost son, and when it dawned
upon the oflicer that he was the slayer of his own child, it so preyed upon
his mind that he deserted and has never been seen or heard of since.
,Thls thrilling story was read hy a number of people who knew Major
Rockefeller intimately. They wondered greatly, as to their certain knowledge
that oflicer was never married.
The wife of an oflicer in the Ninth Infantry, who knew Rockefeller in
his younger days, said yesterday:
"He never was married and in 1S72. when he was, according to the tale,
in Hongkong, ho was stationed at Fort D. A. Russell. My husband was
there at the same time and I remember distinctly the presence of Lieutenant
Rockefeller. He was a confirmed bachelor, though I believe that at the time
he went to. Manila, about 1S9S, he was engaged to be married."
The story is laughed at by the enlisted men, who claim that the body of
Major Rockefeller is probably lying at the bottom of one of the numerous
wells that are to be found in the islands. FYLES ON PARADE.

NEW YORK. Oct. 15.â From San Fran-
CAJLIFORNIANS IN NEW YOSK.
ARMY PEOPLE DERIDE
A YELLOW SENSATION
It is our opinion that if the people of this city are
not already disgusted with the Phclan Democracy
they will be disgusted after water rates are fixed in
February ac?t.
Bm there iÂ« little prospect of the people getting
results with respect to water rates from this Boarl
of Supervisors. The personal feeling displayed at
Monday's meeting indicates that upon the water sub
ject at least the members are irreconcilably at ioggrr
heads. Indeed, the signs of disorganization multiply,
as time goes by. Platform pledges, political obliga
tions and a desire to accumulate j>artv prtfstige melt
away in the face of bickerings and jealousy among
rival demagogues. .'.
Perhaps it may be said thr.t there is little to learn
regarding the affairs of the water company. Possibly
it IS true that if all the information which has been
accumulated in past years in the course of similar in
vestigations were compiled in book form it would
make :Â« series of volumes as voluminous as the Brit
ish Patent Office rcp.irts. This fact, however, should
not <lctÂ«*r the Supervisors from making further in
qniry. It is less trouble to listen to (he evidence oi
Spring Valley officials than to read up the testimony
given at former sitting? of the board.*
However, it is to be hoped that the investigation
which is about to be instituted into Spring Vallej-'s
af airs will be thorough and effective! Last winter the
Supervisors alleged lliat lack of "information" com
pelled them to fix rates at a higher figure than was
called for by their pledges. They did not dare to
let the month of February pass without enacting an
ordinance, and between January 8 and February 28
there was not sufficient time in which to make a thor
ough investigation.
Indeed, f-hou'd such turn out to be tht ca>e, it may
be said that he is not the first California politician
whose views of local affairs have been modified by
consultation -.vith the crown-heads of Europe or from
inspection of the cfTeic municipal systems of the O1J
World.
For four years now the water company has been
I'helan's especial bete noire. By means of inquiries
into its affairs he has managed to manufacture x suiTi
c:ent amount of personal notoriety to keep himself*
constantly before the community in the light of an
honest and painstaking official. If it be tru?, as inti
mated by Reed, that at last he has changed his mind
with reference to the relations of the corporation to
the communhyAthc people should be apprised of the
fact at once.
On the surface the difficulty between Mayor Phe
lan anÂ«i Supervisor Reed appears to be merely a quar
rel among rival politicians over the privilege of ac
cumulating political capital out of the popular griev
ance against the water monopoly, but between the
lines <;ne may easily read something far deeper and
more important than personal jealousy.
THE proceedings of the Board of Supervisors on
Monday afternoon with reference to instituting
the annual inquiry into the affairs of the Spring
Valley Water Works as a basis for fixing rates le
quire explanation before the public will be able to
fully comprehend them.
ThJE ANNUAL WATE^ 1ISQUIRY
Was the confidential letter of the banker to Valen
tine any worse than Valentine's circulars to his em
ployes? That question cannot be answered until the
letter has been made public. We challenge Valentine
to publish it and let the voters judge.
It will be difficult for any one to explain why Valen
tine sent his pamphlets to his subordinates in the ex
press company upon any other ground than that of an
intention to influence their votes. He has not, in
deed, declared an intention to discharge any one who
does not read his circulars and support Bryan, but hz
lias certainly made known to them how he wishes
them to vote, and clearly conveyed to them the in
timation that if they wish to stand well with the cor
poration they must stand for the Democratic candi
date.
We can hardly hope that Valentine will make the
letter public. It is easy for a tax-shirker to become a
shirker of all sorts of public duties. Moreover, in
making 'charges of intimidation Valentine is walking
on ground that is dangerous for him. He is known
to have been sending his anti-imperial circulars to the
employes of Wclls-Fargo and also to employes of the
Southern Pacific Company. These pamphlets- de
nounce McKinley and advocate the election of Bryan.
The employes of Wells-Fargo know that Valentine is
president of the company, that he has power to dis
charge them, and it is therefore natural they should
draw from the pamphlets the conclusion that Valen
tine demands they shall vote for Bryan.
If Valentine stated correctly the purport of that
banker's letter, his duty as a citizen is plain. He
should publish the letter. That would be a benefit to
the public, for it would have tJie good effect of put
ting before the people a specific offense of the kind
complained of by the Bryanites and giving the coun
try "a chance to estimate just how far the intimida
tion is seriously meant and how far it is dangerous.
The cry of coercion in the campaign is not a new
one. It was raised by the Bryanites four years ago
and has been as?erte-l more than once this year. It
is therefore an issty: in which the people have an in
terest, and, moreover, that interest is one of some
importance. An attempt to coerce or to intimidate
voters is about as gross an offense as can be com
mitted. If, therefore, an attempt has been made to
coerce Mr. Valentine it is his duty to expose the of
fender. He should not keep as a confidential secret
a letter from a banker threatening him with a loss
of his office merely for supporting Bryan.
WHEN addressing a political meeting in Oak
land on Saturday .night John J. Valentine,
president of Wclls-Fargo Express Company,
stated he had received a letter intimating that he
would be removed from his office if he did not cease
advocating the election of Bryan. When asked by a
reporter to give the name of the author of the letter
be declined to'do so. saying it was confidential. The
o;ily information he would give is that the letter is
from a banker. He is reported to have added that he
referred to it at the meeting only "to illustrate the
fact that there is a disposition to coerce people in this
campaign." *
VALENTINE 0ND COERCION.
pai&n four years ago on a platform of free
silver Mr. McKinley advocated a sound
currency and protection to American in
dustries. We have seen and experienced
the effect of U.p latter polK-y. which has
been put to practical test, and rs a result
we are now enjoying the greÂ«itc-5t era Oi
prosperity California has ever known.
How could any person possessed of Ms?
reasoning faculties desire to return to the
former conditions?
"If the theories and principles of the
Democratic party are correct, then the
theories and principles of the Populist
party are incorrect. If such were not the
fact there would be no necessity for the
existence and maintenance of the two or
ganizations, and the only conclusion that
I have been able to draw from actual ob
servation is that both of these parties are
prolific in theories which are incapable of
bein? put to practical use, and when the
two narties combine one of them must
sacrifice its principles and theories or be
inconsistent. Therefore, the rational de
duction from such a combination would
imply that their adherents will be pre
sented with a lot of impracticable theories
for consideration, while the manipulators
of fusion endeavor to secure the patron
ape that would be created should Jlr. j
Bryan be successful, of which, however,
I think there is not the slightest proba
bility. E. F. BERNHARD.

l~" MIL F. BERNHARD, a prominent
L_ Democrat of Fresno, and who is
j well-known throughout the San
I Joa/iuin Valley. has announced
I that he intends to vote for McKin
ley and Roosevelt. Mr, Bernhard is one
of the 'active members of the Fresno
Chamber of Commerce and one of the or
ganizers of the San Joaquin Valley Com
mercial Association. He was a member
and secretary of the committee that three
years ago made the successful campaign
against the New York importers who
Â¦were endeavoring to prevent the increase
of the tariff 'on raisins from 1% to 2%
cents per pound and on Zante currants
from UA to 2 cents per pound. Mr. Bern
hard comes from a Democratic family
and has voted the Democratic ticket since
attaining his majority in 1SS2. In the fol
lowing statement he tells .why he will
support McKinley for President:
"Editor San Francisco Call: President
McKinley is a true American and a great
statesman. The principles of government
advocated and practiced by him are for
the best interests of the people. His
patriotism, ability and honesty of pur

lieves that good and honest government
is superior to party considerations, and
who haa the moral courage to rise above
party prejudices, assert his manhood and
cast a vote in accordance with these con
victions.
"In view of the great change made in
the historv of the world in the past three
years, the successful termination of the
international complications with which
this country has had to contend and the
masterly and successful manner in which
they have been handled ought to appeal
to . every patriotic citizen who loves his
home and honors his countryao show his
appreciation of the administration that
has placed this great republic in a posi
tion to command the admiration and re
spect of all the powers of the
"In his selection of officers for The army
and diplomatic representatives to conduct
negotiations he has risen superior to
party lines and demonstrated his loyalty
and patriotism by the selectfon of men
of integrity and ability regardless of po
litical affiliation.
"The Pacific Coast owes to the policy
of the present administration all the pros
perity which it now enjoys. A gTeat and
pro-wins trade has been opened with the
Philippines and the Orient. Without pro
tection ih^ fruit, raisin and other indus
tries of this coast will be destroyed.
"I cannot support Mr. Bryan because
he and the leaders of the Democratic
party do not seem to have realized that
the history and the conditions of the
country have changed during the past few
years and that if the people are to pros
per a new and progressive policy must be
adopted to meet th- 1 changed conditions.
They appear to be unable to deviate from
a policy that may have been beneficial in
the past, but is now wholly inadequate to
meet present requirements.

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
It is Mr. Loud's desire to put the Postoffice Depa-t
ment on a paying basis, so that one-cent letter post
age can be adopted at an early date. His efforts in
that direction have had the indorsement of every
business organization in the Union. All citizens are
interested in these improvements, for all will be bene
fited by them. The voters of the Fifth District should
be proud to be represented in Congress by a man
whose national statesmanship is recognized all over
the Union and whose work has been so widely bene
ficial. â¢'
Of Mr. Loud's earnestness and zeal in this con
test for the public interests there can be no doubt.
His persistence in continuing the fight in the face^of a
most powerful opposition has been as remarkable as
the nature of the opposition itself.. He has studied
the subject so thoroughly that his knowledge of pos
tal affairs, not of America only but of foreign coun
tries, is superior to that of any other man in Ameri
can politics. He has worked in the postoffice and he
knows .the subject not only by study' but by practical
dealing with it. His management of the postal legis
lation of Congress for the last five years has already
resulted in marked improvements, among which may
be mentioned the extension of the rural delivery ser
vice.
postal matters than any other man in the House, hav
ing made a thorough study of them during his service
in the Postoffice of this city. The first two Congresses
in which Mr. Loud served were under the control of
Democrats, and consequently, while he was -appointed
to the Postal Committee, he could take no initiative in
postal legislation. When the Fifty-fourth Congress
was organized, with Tom Reed in the chair, Mr.
Loud was appointed chairman of the Postal Commit
tee and at once began to institute those reforms and
extensions which have so much, improved the ser
vice of late years. Among the measures he designed
was that of placing the department upon a self
supporting basis. The -famous. Loud bill, aiming at
the prevention of the J.buse of second class mail privi
leges by those who have no right to such privileges;
Â«vas the result. Hardly any important reform of re
cent times has been more violently opposed or more
misrepresented by the opposition. Mr. Loud suc
ceeded in getting it lhrough the House in 1897, but
ii was defeated in the Senate. The fight, therefore, is
still unfinished, arid, it rests with the voters of the
Fifth District_whether or no the champion of postal
reform and cheaper letter postage shall be defeated
in the interests of men and corporations who are
profiting by an abuse of the existing law.
A FEW weeks ago a delegation of Los Angeles
jobbers met the traffic officials of the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe railways in this city with
the purpose of inducing the latter to establish the
same rates per mile from Los Angeles to San Joaquin
Valley points as are in force or might be established
from San Francisco to said points. As our Los An
pcles friends have attempted to pose as the unself
ith benefactors of the valley merchants by assuring
the latter that the sole purpose of the former is to se
cure reduced freight rates from Los Angeles, it is
well here to note that the Los Angeles delegation
plainly stated that it mattered not to them how the
railroads accomplished this equalization of mileage
ratesâ whether by raising the rates from San Fran
cisco or reducing them from Los Angeles. This re
moves the mafk of philanthropy and discloses the
proposition as it is â one of plain, cold business. The
Los Angeles merchants wish to sell goods in the San
Joaquin Valley without yielding up any portion of
their profits in the equalization of freight rates, and
therefore ask the railroads to relieve them of the ne
cessity for so doing.
The railroads declined to disturb the existing re
lation of rates between the two cities and San Joa
quin Valley points, and the Lcs Angeles people have
filed a complaint before the State Railroad Commis
sioners praying for an order which will bring about
the desired result. We are informed that able attor
neys have been retained to present their case and that
the same will be heard in the near future.
Our southern jfnends u?c mileage as the ground
work of their case, and claim that as they are con
siderably nearer Southern San Joaquin Valley points
than is San Francisco rates to these points from Los
Angeles should be proportionately less than from San
Francisco. This on its face appears equitable an^l
just, and we are free to admit that where Ifie condi
tions â physical or competitive â surrounding trans
portation from two different points to a third point
arc the same, mileage is the proper basis for rate
tnaking. By this we do not mean that tariffs so es
tablished must necessarily bear the fame rates per
mile regardless of length of haul. It is to be borne in
mind that the cost of loading, waybilling and unload
ing freight moving but ten miles is quite as great as
though the same was transported one thousand miles.
Therefore it would be manifestly unjust to adopt for
the one thousand mile haul the same rate per mile as
that established for the ten mile haul.
We find a wide dissimilarity in the physical condi
tions between Los Angeles and, for example. Bakers
field, as compared with those between San Francisco
and the same town. Between Los Angeles and Bakers
fiehi are three range? of mountains, involving climbs
to altitudes of more than fourteen hundred, thirty-two
hundred and four thousand feet, respectively, and ne
cessitating the employment of ponderous "helpers,"
as the extra locomotives used in the mountains are
called. Occasionally in winter it is even necessary to
employ snowplows on the Tehachapi Mountains.
Through these ranges of mountains are numerous
tunnels, among which is the San Fernando, the long
est, we believe, on the Southern Pacific Compan3*"s
system, and one of the longest in the world. These
tunnels were expensive to build and arc proportion
ately expensive to maintain. Furthermore, along this
stretch of road there is no way traffic to speak of,
there being no towns of any consequence and no agri
culture between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. On
the other hand, between San Francisco and Bakers
field the grade i= almost imperceptible, as indicated
by the sluggish San Joaquin River, which drains the
valiey. There is not Â« tunnel worthy of mention on
the entire line, and "helping engines" and snowplows
arc uncalled for. The railways serving the San Joa
quin Valley from San Francisco are lined .with nu
merous towns and even prosperous cities, and the soil
is, comparatively speaking, under a high state of cul
tivation, thus affording a large volume of way busi
ness. With these facts before them, can our enter
prising friends of the Angel City consistently ask that
the same rate per miie be established from Los An
pcles as from San Francisco to San Joaquin Valley
points?
Nor is the difference in competitive conditions fo be
lost sight of. Between Los Angeles atVd San Joaquiu
Valley points the railroads encounter absolutely no
water competition whatsoever. .On the other hand,
they are exposed to the permanent and, at times, ex
ceedingly aggressive competition of the river boats
which ply between Sin Francisco and Stockton, and
which practically puts the railroads out of the local
freight business. The river influence is directly felt
by them as far as Newman, the head of navigation on
the San Joaquin, and necessarily has to be consid
ered in establishing rates to points beyond.
There is a third element in the situation which we
do not believe the Honorable Board of Railroad
Commissioners will ignore in considering the de
mands of our friends of the southern metropolis. It
is that of equity. The merchants and capitalists of
San Francisco built the San Joaquin Valley road, and
thereby brought about a very material reduction in
freight rates between this city and valley points, thus
benefiting directly not so much themselves as the pro
ducers of the valley. Is San Francisco to be rewarded
for her enterprise and public -spirit by having the back
door of the- valley thrown open to competitors who
have taken no part or spent a dollar in its develop
ment? We think not. If the people of Los Angeles
would share in the trade of the San Joaquin Valley
they should build a railroad over the Tehachapi
Mountains. The right of way will cost but little.

SLOCUM AND LUCKENBACH:.
Buns of the Two Tugs From New
York Compared.
Captain McCoy has every reason to be
proud of the time made by the new tup
Luckenbach from New York to San Fran
cisco. In elapsed time the Luckenbach
beats the Government tug fourteen days,
but in actual steaming time the Slocum
wins out by a small margin. The Slocum
Is nearly as big again as the Luckenbach.
so the time made by Captain McCoy is
all the more noteworthy.
The runs of the two tugs were:
Luckenbaehâ From New York, 72 days;
from Santa Lucia, C6 days; from Rio do
Janeiro, 41 days; from Coronel, 20 days,
and from Callao to San Francisco, 16 days.
Slocumâ From New York, 86 days; from
St. Thomas, 78 days; from Pernambuco,
65 days; from Montevideo, 45 days; from
Callao, 16 days, via Acapulco 7 days.
It will be noted that the Luckenbach
and Slocum both made tne run from Cal
lao in sixteen days, but the Slocum put
in at Acapulco and lost a day in conse
quence. Nevertheless the run of the
Luckenbach is the best ever made from
ocean to ocean by a vessel of her size.
Captain Williams Discharged.
United States Court Commissioner Ilea
cock yesterday dismissed the charge
against Captain Bert Williams of the
whaler Balaena of cruelty on the high seas
preferred by Michael Brown, who accused
the captain of having triced him to the
rigging for being saucy.
The evidence was very conflicting and
Judge Keacock was of the opinion that a
conviction could not be had.

of the service, and this- includes the risk
of negligence upon the part cf a felioyv
nervant when he is acting in the dis
charge of his duty as a servant of him
who is the common master of both.""
The Injured employe therefore did not
recover anything. He hart assumed the
risk, so the court said, of any Injury hap
pening through ihe negligence of his fel
low employes. Of course a stranger can
recover ef a person who has injured him
or from his Â¦ servants whiKÂ» acting In his
master's employment. bo( ause he has not
assumed or expected that he would do
anything of the kind. But thi> court says
the rule is otherwise with respect to em
ployes.
In the years IS II ancl 1S4^ the courts in
this country were first required to decido
this -question. The first case arose in
South Carolina, the other In Massachu
setts. The latter case of Farwell vs. Bos
ton and Worcester Railroad Company 13
the leading case in the United States.
One reason for this is that Chief Justioa
Shaw, who gave the opinion of the court.
was and still Is regarded as one of the
most eminent on the roll of American
Jurists and many of his opinions are more
weighty than those written by less able
men. Although the cases mentioned hai
been previously decided, he said he
would consider the question as though it
had not been answered, and thus he rea
soned out the answer quite independently
of those who had done so before him. Yet
he came to the same conclusion. The casj
was that of an engineer who had been
injured through the negligence of a
switchman. In the South Carolina case
the court decided the question the same
way. two of the Judges, however, differ
ing from the majority. Thus the English
rule that an employer is not responsible
to an employe for an injury caused by a
>fellow-employe was adopted as the Ameri
can rule, and on the ground that the risk
was assumed when the employment waa
undertaken. This rule wan adopted by
one State after another until it came tj
be the rule everywhere.
There has been difficulty in trying to ap
ply It, as we shall soon lf-arrf. The reader
will bear in mind the words fellow
servant. An employer Is not liable to ono
of his servants for an Injury caused by a
fellow-servant. But who is a fellow-ser
vant? Are the conductor on a train anil
the engineer fellow-servants? Some courts
have s=aid they are; others that they are
not. In all those cases in which servants
are not thus related to each other the
master la liable to one of them through an
Injury caused by another. Just as he
would be to a stranger. The Priestly an I
Farwell cases and all others simply go In
this extent. And, as we shall see before
concluding these articles, there are raanv
cases In which servants have the same
employer but are not regarded* as fellow
servants. When they are not thus related,
the moat ancient of all rules, stated at tho
outset of this article, still applies, and the
master is liable for injuries nappening to
them as In the case of persona who ara
not employed^by him. With this state
ment of the most general of all rules de
fining the relations of employe and em
ployers the way is prepared for looking
more closely into their legal relations.

Introduction.
We can hardly Imagine a subject of
greater practical Importance to the mil
lions of workers than the legal relations
existing between themselves and their
employers. If an operative in a factory
is Injured through the carelessness of an
other operative, can he recover anything
of his employer for having such a negli
gent operative? What is the employer's
duty in such a case? Can he employ, any
one he pleases without incurring any risk
for his inefficiency or negligence? What
kind of machinery can he use? Has he a
right to use any he pleases, however de
fective or dangerous it may be, without
rendering himself liable? Suppose a ma-
Chine is defective without his knowing It;
is he responsible for the consequences?
Again, if he promises to repair a machine
and does not. Is he liable for an Injury
that afterward happens? What Instruc
tions must he give to minors before set
ting them at their task, and what safe
guards or means of protection must he
use to prevent accidents? These and
many other questions of a similar nature
will be answered in this series of articles.
The great army of employers and em
ployed have a deep Interest in knowing
what their legal relations are.
â¢ No principle of law is better known
than thisâ that no man Is responsible for
the acts of others. No principle is more
obvious or more In harmony with the
general sense of justice.
Liability of a Master for the Acts of
Â« His Servant.
Tet there 1b one great exception to this
rule. A master or employer is liable for
the wrongful and negligent acts of his
servant or employe which are done while
pursuing his master's business. Of course,
his master Is not liable for every act. but
only for those that are within the scops
of his business. For these, however, he
has long been held liable, nor is there any
escape for him. For example, if a coach
man while driving his master's hors*3
should drive negligently and run into an
other carriage and Injure it his employer
would be obliged to pay for the injury
on the ground that he ought not to em
ploy, such a coachman.
The story Is told of an eminent lawyer,
Lord Abinger, that one day when his
coachman was driving his horses became
very wild, and Abinger feared unpleasant
and costly consequences. So he shouted
out to the coachman, "Drive into some
thing cheap." Few, Indeed, are those who
combine so much law and coolness. If an
accident must happen, for which he knew
by the law he would be obliged to pay.
he would rather pay a small sum than a
larsre one. and consequently the order.
This doctrine of the responsibility of the
master for the acts of his servant is best
known in,the.form of a Latin maxim, re
spondent superior. In the Roman law it
was applied to the head of a family, be
cause neither his son nor slave could be
sued and made responsible. The pater
familias only could be sued. But with us
all have equal personal rights and liabili
ties.' Nevertheless, this rule taken from
the Roman law is still the rule existing in
England and America, although the rea
son for its existence does not exist either
In English or American society. Let us
not forget, though, that the master Is re
sponsible for those acts only that are done
"by his servant within the scope of his
business: When he departs from this- he
and he only is answerable for his conduct,
as much as though he had no master.
The Case of Priestly vs. Fowler.
Such was the rule of law determining
the relation between master and servant
until 1S37. when Lord Abinger decided the
case of Priestly against Fowler, which
has caused far more suits and legal dis
cussion than any other case in the wide
realm of law. Priestly was a servant of
Fowler, who was a butcher. Fowler re
quested him to go with some goods In a
van that was driven by another sen-ant.
Priestly went as he was bidden, but the
van was overloaded, broke down and
Priestly was thrown off and badly in
jured. So he sued his master and tried to
recover, for the injury that had been
caused through the negligence of .another
servant in Fowler's employ. Lord Ab
lnger In rendering his judgment said th.it
ii a master was to be held liable to his
servant in this action the principle would
extend to an alarming degree. . "If ,the
owner of the carriage is responsible for
the sufficiency of his carriage to his ser
vant he is responsible for the negligence
of his coachmaker. or hl3 harnensmaker
or his coachman. The footman, therefore,
who rides behind the carriage may have
an action against his master for a defect
in the carriage owing to the negligence of
the coachmaker. or for a defect in the
harness arising from the negligence of the
harnessmaker, or for drunkenness, neelect
or want of skill In the coachman." Lord
Abinger then declared that if the master
was or ought to be held liable in these
cases the principle holding him so would
extend his liability to many others. "The
master, for example, would be liable to
the servant for the negligence of the
chambermaid for puttlnp him into a damp
bed: for that of the upholsterer for send
ing in a crazy bedstead, whereby he was
made to fall down while asleep and Injure
himself; for the negligence of the cook in
not properly cleaning- the copper vessel*
used in the kitchen: of the butcher In
supplying the family with meat of a qual
ity injurious to the health; of the builder
for a defect in the foundations of the
house, whereby It fell and Injured both
the master and the servant by the ruins."
The learned Judge thought that the incon
venience, not to say absurdity, of these
consequences afforded a sufficient argu
ment against holding the master liable in
such cases.
The court then went on to say that the
relation of master and servant never can
Imply an obligation on thr- part of the
master to take more care of his servant
than of himself. "He is no doubt bound
to provide for the safety of his servant
in the course of his employment to the
best of his judgment. Information and be
lief." A servant is not bound to risk his
safety in his master's service and may.
If he fears injury, decline to serve. In
short, the court declared that "to allow
this sort of action to prevail would be an
encouragement to the servant to omit
that diligence and cnutlon which he Is in
duty bound to exercise on the behalf of
his "master to protect him against the
misconduct or negligence of others who
serve him."
The Limit of a Master's Liability.
"Thus, while a master Is responsible to
another for tho neglect or misconduct 1 of
his servant while exercising his employ
ment, he Is not liable to one servant for
the neglect or misconduct of a fellow
servant. This Is the principle decided In
this famous case, and we have plven the
full reasoning of the court because it lies
at the foundation of all the law on this
subject. The case has been cited thou
sands of times, and our readers should
understand It before going- further. They
may indeed think the rule ought to be
otherwise, but we may remark that in
this series of articles we shall not ven
ture on the inquiry what ought to be the
legal relations between employed and em
ployers, but simply Reek to show what
the existing relations are. Thus we shall
not consider theories or indulge in any
Ideas of our own concerninz what the
law ought to be: our task Is a very dif
ferent on"â to" show how the courts in the
different States have defined the rights
and liabilities of employers and their em
ployes In the numerous cases that have
come before them.
The question did not come up again in
England for thirteen years. Then it arose
in the case of a railroad collision, and' a
railroad was sued by one of Its servants
for an injury caused by the collision of
its trains. The court declared the ques
tion to be whether the railroad company
was liable for the injury happening to
one of its own servants by the collision
while traveling In one of its carriages in
discharge of his duty as a servant. Un
doubtedly it would be liable to a passen
ger who had paid his fare: would the
same rule apply to one of its own serv
ants? This was the question, and it was
decided in the negative. The court, after
giving all the reasons for their judgment
stated the rule in the following words:
"A servant when he enrages to serve a
master undertakes- as between himself

NEW YORK, Oct. 16â Tho stock market to
<!ny demonstrated convincingly how the large
Fhort interest had Jx>en eliminated in the course
of yesterday's wholesale demand for stocks
tr.a the purporting influence of this element
deprived the bull pools of a very effectual
fnuw of strength. The campaign for the rise
vat by no means abandoned. On the contrary
very Powerful and resourceful efforts were
made toward continuing the upward movement
of price*. The notable bujing ol the day was
in t'nton Pacific, in which transfers of IOC;,
lioo and even 3flOO share lotn were frequently
recorded on the tape. It was the advance jr.
prl"e* that brought out thcue offerings and
they w<?re confidently absorbed by the brokeis
having the advance in charge. On the frt?
â¢juerit traction? the volume of dealings both
in this Ftuck and in otherv which were manipu
lated for a ris- fell away notably, leading to
recurrent perils of dullness during the day.
Norfolk and Western gave most conspicuous
Â«"\1<iencÂ« of *-iricert<"<l efforts for a rise next
to l/ni<-in I'aclftr. Hut these movements by the
l<uil party <51<J not become prominent until
alter very lanre selling to realize had been
aocompllFhed. The fart of the nrst
hour way {riven up to furious activity and a
fonwÂ»t.at wavering upward movement, mark
ing the feeing of outside demand by those who
had accumulated ptocks at the lower level.
The taking of profit* during this period mubt
have been on a very larxe scale. The sub
wiuent tSfortF to resume the td.anre met with
a number of drawbacks and the heavy under
tone of the market gained force at the da>
progressed. The closing was distinctly heavy.
with prices bÂ«-iow the best and net losses in
Â»nif lm].onajit stocks while the striking net
fraln* wire confined to comparatively few cases.
1'anly as a cause ar.d partly as an effect
there was a recurrence of some of the de
pressing sentiments regarding the speculative
feature* which have long overhung the market.
The fact emerged with some cleaj-ners that
thÂ»- large short interest which was driven to
cover yesterday had bÂ«en actuated to take the
bÂ«>ar *!de by drawing aa analog)' with ths
correF|Â»ori<5ir.K period In the -&st Presidential
campaign, w hÂ«-n the Etock market wa* vio
lently dlÂ«arl>e<J and rapldlr declining. The
(Â¦uddÂ«-n brightening in the money outlook by
reacon r.f Saturday's bank eUKement and the
gild imsK.rt movement gave the bulls an op
jiortunity' for a swift turn against their op
pinit-r.'.i'. There was some positive weakness in
People's Gu as a rrsult of the proposition for
municipal control of the selling price of the
prr^Jurt. and tome of the steel stock! gave
evidence of the depression. There were reces

CHICAGO, Oct. lfi.â The most activity in
wheat was at the start. A 1% drop at Ham
burg and unexpected steadiness at Liverpool
gave rise to Irregular opening, December be
ing quoted in the first movement all the way
from 74Â°i to 75c. The Liverpool steadiness
proved to be the most Influential factor, how
ever, as the crowd was largely short owing to
yesterday's operations and the Liverpool atti
tude caused them some uneasir.eps. The re
opening of mills at Minneapolis and the sale
of a cargo at Antwerp, the nrst in sixteen
months, were a later Influence. Trade, how
ever, was largely local. The buying was large
ly quiet and In a moderate way by shorts,
bulls making only an occasional Investment.
Outside trade as uuual was painfully prominent
by its absence. December slowly advanced
from the opening to 73%c. The advance caused
some profit taking, December I4'8'%c higher.
Corn was moderately active and firm. De
cember closed Vfcc higher at 35V4^35%c.
Oats were t^ulet but firm. December closed
\ic up at 22Hc.
Provisions started easy and were somewhat
Irregular later, but concluded the session fairly
Fteody. lies receipts over the estimate and
lower prices at the yards were discouraging
factors early, and heavy selling oÂ£ November
lard early weakened the whole list. The grain
strength later caused a recovery, but this was
mostly lost on profit-taking. January pork
closed 2V4c higher, lard 2',4c lower and ribs a
shade down.

the climate and crop service of the Weather
nurtau. makes the following report for the
wet k :
"The temperature has been nearly normal
durir.g the week, end in the northern part of
the State conditions have been generally favor
able 'or fruit dryi!;s and raisin making; In the
central nad souihrra pertiurs cool weather,
viti. considerable cloudiness, has prevailed.
&n<l has retarded this work. Light rain has
ikller. in nt-ariy all sections, the greatest pre
cipitation having occurred In Los Ang-eles and
X'icinity. No flams ce fcas bÂ«?en reported, and
It is now stated that the rain of the preced
ing week was less harmful than estimated, as
m^Ft cf the drvirg fruit v.as stacked, and
Javorable weather follow iraj the rain lessened
the injury to grapes on the vines.
"Fruit drying ar.d raisin making are nearly
completed, and late grapes .ire being gathered.
T'>kays and Unseats are plentiful and of ex
ctll^t.t quality. The yield of prunes and othÂ«r
ceciiuous f 1 ults Is reported r.early average in
i. sections except the south. The raisin crop
Â»i!l be almost equal to the average, and in
many placet the quality It said to be superior.
Walnut picking has rrogTesseil Slowly, owing
to unfavorable conditions: the nuts are gen
erally cf good quality, and the yield will be
about the Fame ae last season's in some places,
though there are large quantities of the email
Â«r sizes. Oranges continue thrifty In all sec
tions. a:id are maturing raplcly; prospects are
Â«xc^;ient for an urupually heavy crop.
"The soil has been softened by the recent
rains, ar.<l iK now in gocd condition In most
ewtionF. Farmers are plowing and seeding,
end preparations are b<?ir.g made for a large
acreage of crain. Grass and volunteer grain
have I'^en riven a good start by the rains, and
pasturage is becoming mere plentiful. It is re
ported that there is ar^ unuFually large amount
of enow In the mountains."

8MEMBERS SHOW ESTEEM
FOR THEIR PRESIDENT
FDR a time the police and detec
tives dseamed Â«,f catching the
Eastern safe-crackers, who have
transferred their tools ana craft
to Pacific climes, but their
"pipes" soon went out and the glory of a
great capture was not tor them.
Last Sunday a woman reported to Max
Goldberg, president of the San Francteco
Collateral Loan Bank at 638 Kearny
etreet, paying ishe had been disturbed for
four rights in succession by the opera
tions of safe-crackers, who were drilling
and filing In an effort to reach the Interior
of the vaults of the bank. Goldberg at
once sent for the detectives and an Inves
tigation wat* begun. The woman impart
ing this valuable "tip" to the president
stated that she occupied .a room Imme
diately over the large steel repositories
and ehe declared she knew what she was
talking about.
For a long time the detectives searched
the premises. They' arrived at the con
clusion that the "crooks" were experts In
their line of business and had covered up
the traces of each night's work to renew
It the next. They derided to stow them
selves away and await with bullseye
lanterns the burglars' coming 1 .
Soon after 11 o'clock the sleuths were
rewarded by the sounds of files and drills
The noise of the shrill prating came from
overhead.
"They are cutting In from the top," Bald
one detective drawing his revolver.
"Let us descend upon them in a body "
said his companion.
The detectives located the sounds fn a
room overhead, and with visions of black
masks, diamond drills and fine flies
stealthily entered. The noise st&pped and
a man Jumped out of bed. He made pro
fuse apologies for his loud nnorins and
said that If It resembled the noise of filing
he would chanjre Its key. He also ex
pressed regret that he had crushed the of
ficers' hopen bo abruptly, and turning over
In bed he went to sleep again.
Just as the officers were leaving they
met the woman. She Informed them that
she had heard the safe-crackers at work
that evening:, but they gave her the glassy
etare and passed out.
Goldberg bought the drinks.

to blame for Harney's death, as he did
not mean to kill him. Harney beat him
after he had a Pght with Charley Harney

died in St. Mary's Hospital October 12
from the effects of a knife wound Inflicted

eral times and that while Ferrer was at
tempting to regain his feet and to protect
himself from further onslaught, he drove
his pooketknife into Sullivan's skull.
Attorney Mack showed by the testimony
of several witnesses that Sullivan's repu
tation for peace and quiet was not good
and that he was of a very quarrelsome
disposition
The jury returned a verdict that death
was caused by septic meningitis, "the di
rect result of a knife wound in the head.
Inflicted by Nash Ferrer." The Jury

brought to the attention of the police late
last night. While passing along Folsom
street, near the corner of Fourth, Henry
Ordway was approached by a little girl
almost naked and crying bitterly. Be
tween her sobs she said that her little
sister was dying, and asked Ordway to
come to the house and help her. He fol
lowed the child to the rear of 906 Folsom
street.
Lying naked on a bed in the one room
of the miserable home Pauline Schneider,
a six-year-old girl, lay choking to death,
tho result of a violent hemorrhage.
Ordway did what he could to relieve
the little one's sufferings and had an am
bulance called for. When it arrived not
a stitch of clothing could be found in
which to wrap the dying girl.
The ticking was torn from the mattress
and pressed into service and the little one
was sent to the Receiving Hospital. It
was found that the little one's sufferings
were caused from eating raw vegetables.
She will die, it Is thought.
The mother and two other children are
still at the Folsom street room without
food. The father is sick in a Chicago hos
pital.

CHICAGO. Oct. 16.â Jack Root, the mid
dleweight champion of the West, knocked
out Dick O'Brien of Lewiston, Me., in
three rounds to-night at Tattersall's.
Root kept O'Brien at long range by con
stant left-hand Jabbing and the latter was
unable to land a single effective blow
throughout the fight;
The first round was Root's by a big mar
gin. He jabbed O'Brien all over the ring
with straight left-hand jabs to the face.
O'Brien tried hard to retaliate with right
swings, but was unable to land.-
The second round was a repetition of
the first. O'Brien endeavored in every
possible manner to get home a punch,
but was unsuccessful. In the meantime
Root was working his left to the face
and stomach with sickening regularity
and O'Brien was wobbling when he took
his corner.
After thirty-five seconds of fighting in
the third round Root ended the one-sided
contest with a straight left to the Jaw.
O'Brien had to be carried to his corner
after being counted out and it was fully
ten minutes before he was able to walit
to his dressing-room. The men met at
catchweights.
In the preliminaries Harry Harris of
Chicago was given the decision over Cas
per Leon of New -York after six rounds
of fast fighting, in which Harri3 had a
big advantage in every round.

of Herbert Davenport on the Yukon River
on July 15. King passed a good night
preceding the hanging and never once

walked to the gollows steadily and re
quired no assistance at any time. He was
cool enough to talk to the hangman in a
joking way while the latter was adjust

thing to sey he replied:
"No, nothing to raise a Bensatlon â no
lies to tell. Be sure you fix it right: don't
strangle me." he continued to the hang

drop was sprung.

missed him but a few inches.
Young Hirth was in the office and th*
snake stood In the doorway. While prt
paring to strike again the snake was ren
dered hors du combat by a piece of irim
piping in the hands of a p!umJ>er. Uo
fore It was-ki!let3 the Â»nake bit itself,
thus aiding In its own destruction.
â¢
The reptile was two feet long and ha<l
three rattles and a button. How u got
into the business part of the city is a
mystery. It may have ueen brought m
a load -of hay or carried into the plumbing
shop in a piece of pipe returned by plumb
ers after fixing a well In the country.

TWO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA GRADUATES WHO HAVE BEEN
CALLED TO BERLIN TO TAKE PART IN IMPORTANT WORK NOW
BEING CARRIED ON BY THE ROYAL PRUSSIAN ACADEMY.
SIGNORINA ESTEFANO COLLAMARINI. THE FAMOUS DIVA NOW
AT THE TIVOLI OPERA-HOUSE. WHOSE PERFORMANCE OF CAR
MEN HAS AROUSED ADMIRATION AMONG THE CRITICS.
BERKELEY. Oct. 16.â As a recog
nition of the high standing of the
University of California two of
Its graduate students have been
summoned to Berlin to take part
!n Important astronomical calculation
:.ow being conducted by the Koyal Prus
fian Academy of Sciences. The young
men eo honored are Russell Tracy Craw
ford and Frank Elmore Ross.
The work which the two students have
to do Is assisting In the compilation of
"The Thesaurus Posltionum 'Stellarum
Kixarum," to be published by the Royal
Prussian Acadomv. This work will em-
Uody all the results thus far obtained in
i!Ve determining of the positions of the
fixed stars. It has been undertaken by
Dr. Rlstenpart, one of the greatest of
European mathematical a<-tronomers.
who. while at Heidelberg and Kiel, saw
the difficulties under which astronomer?
labored on account of the inadequacies of
the star catalogues In existence, .^o
formed a plan for the publication of a
work which will embody the results of
the labor* of an astronomer* in th.Â» past
on determining the rÂ«nÂ»ition of lixcl Â£'ars
On his plan bcirj: leari.ed by the Royal
Prussian Academy of Science* he was im
media:e!y fumrauncd to H^rlln and an
immense" furti <^f money was set aside for
the undertaking.
The Thesuuru.*. when completed, will
indicate the position of some M0.000 fixed
Ftars. It will be the one complete cata
logue of them and will be fundamental for
stellar astronomy of all future times. Sev
eral years will be taken to complete the
calculation.
The appointments of Ross and Craw
ford were made by Dr. Ristenpart. Both
young men have zraduated from thÂ«
State University. Ross receiving his B.S.
in 1S?6 and Crawford in 1837. They Â«are
now taking post-graduate work and aro
lioth candidates for the degree of doc
tor of philosophy next spring. Both
have published papers in astronomical
journals and have had favorable attention
drawn to their work.
The young men are students of rare
ability. Both have been student assistants
at the Berkeley astronomical department
and fellows at the Lick Observatory. Mr.
Crawford is at present at Mount Hamil
ton.
These two graduate students are the
only Americans who have been offered
appointments by Dr. Rlstenpart. It is a
high compliment to their ability and to
the splendid advantage* which California
offers to her astronomical students.
RosÂ»s> and Crawfonl will remain hero
until spring to receive their doctors' de
grees. They will then go to Berlin and,
besides their work, will pursue higher
studies at the university there.

THE third edition this season of
"Carmen" was given at the Tlvoli
Opera-house last evening before
one of the largest audiences in
the history of the popular house.
Hundreds unablo to get seats were turned
away.
The measure of popular appreciation
happened in this ca.=e to be a just one.
Rarely indeed has San Francisco heard
so good a Carmen as the Collamariniâ
rarely indeed has so good a Carmen been
so admirably supported. In the notable
cast Salassa appears as the toreador,
Russo as Don 'Jose, Nlcolinl as Zuniga
and Repetto as Mlcaela, and all seemed
Inspired to highest effort by the pplendid
Carmen of Collamarini, who herself ap
peared inspired in turn with the congenial
atmosphere. Her conception of the fas
cinating, gypsyâ the only operatic heroine,
by the way, entirely destitute of any sav
ing graceâ only arouses to new admiration
with each additional performance seen.
Her glorious voice of richest timber, an
swering without effort and instantly to
the painted mood, her fine truth and grace
of gesture, her luxuriant physical charms,
her admirable art, all make a picture that
will not be easily forgotten by those for
tunate enough to have seen and heard
her.
The Don Jose of Russo last evening was
in amusing contrast to his performance
of the same part some weeks ago with
another Carmen. There was in that case
a really absurd discrepancy of size, and
the little tenor, who h&s no small sen?e
of the ridiculous, could not help betray
ing his appreciation of the humor on't.
Last night it was different and the Don
Jose of Signor Russo must be set down

This was not exciting enough, so Mur
ray did the usual thing In such cases
made and provided. He rode his horse
into the saloon owned and operated by a
man named Ager. Murray wanted more
whisky and when it did not come fast
enougn he phot a few bottles to pieces
with his revolver. This accelerated tne
movements of the barkeeper and Murray
added still more to his overplus of whisky
and blood.
During these antics Murray's horse was
charging around the saloon and a large
oil lamp was overturned. In a moment
the room was in a blaze, and Murray rode
his horse out into the back yard. Here
he found himself enclosed with a high
board fence on three sides with no hopo
of escape and the burning saloon on tne
other, lagging his spurs into his horse he
charged through the flre and down the
road up .which he had come.
The people of Sunol turned out to fight
the flre first, and when they had suc
ceeded in putting that out they turned to
look for Murray. But Murray had al
readv gone and nothing remained but the
damaged saloon and the recollections of a
lively night for Sunol.
Murray came from somewhere out of
the darkness in the canyon over near
Pleasanton. As Sunol is a very quiet lit
tle town Murray's presence was soon no
ticed, for a fusillade of shots from a re
volver does not occur there every night
in the week. When the; shots attracted tho
attention of the good people of Sunol and
they peered cautiously out into the night
they beheld Murray charging up and
down the main street shooting as he
went.

A largo number of Mr. Schnee s fellow

and made him and his wife take their
places within. The carriage was then
pulled by the enthusiastic citizens to Sun

POSTUM CEEEAL.
AMOPJG THE CLERGY.
Coffee Being Replaced by Postum
Pood Coffee.
"1 am the wife of a minister. About
three years ago a warm friend, an ex-
emplary mother and the conscientious
wife of a minister, asked me if I had
ever tried giving up coffee and usine
the Postum Food Coffee. I had been
telling' her of my excessive nervousness
and ill health. She said: 'We drink
nothing else for breakfast but Postum
Food Coffee, and it is a dclieht and a
comfort to have something that we do
not have to refuse the. children when
they ask for it.'
"I was surprised that she would per-
mit the children to drink even the food
coffee, but she explained that it was a
most healthful beverage and that the
children, thrived on it. A very little
thought convinced me that for brain
work one should not rely unon a stimu-
lant such as coffee is. but should have
food and the very best of food.
"My first trial of Postum was a fail-
cre. The rnmid of all work brought tt
to the table lukewarm, weak and alto-
gether lacking in character. We were
in despair, but decided on dne more
trial. At the second trial we faithfully
followed the directions, used four tea-
spoonfuls to the pint of water, let it
boil full fifteen minutes after the real
boiling be{ran, and served it with rich
cream. It was delicious and we were
all won. . f
"I have Â«ince suns the praises of Pos-
tum Food Coffee on manv. manv occa-
sions and have induced numbers of
friends to abandon coffee and use Pos-
tum, with remarkable results. The wife
of a college professor said to me a short
time afjo that nothinc had ever pro-
duced bo marked a change in her hus-
band's health as the leaving off of cof-
fee and the use of Postum Food Cof-
fee.*' Edith Smith Davis, Appleton,

Mr. Osborne positively refused to make
public at this time the contents of tho
amdavit. The hearing was then ad
journed until to-morrow.
At this juncture Mr. Osborne submitted
to Magistrate Brann a lengthy typewrit
ten affidavit, which he requested the mag
istrate to read at his convenience. Mr.
House again objected and the magistrate
said he would take the matter under ad
visement. Mr. Osborne said the affidavit
in question is the one signed by the wit
ness Wetherbee, In which the latter told
of an attempt made on the part of Jones
to Induce him to go into a scheme to get
the greater part of Rice's property and
money.
"You had better change the complaint."
Mr. Osborne . said that his purpose In
asking the question was to show that
away back In January a. scheme or con
splracy*was on foot to get possession of
Mr. Rice's property. To this Magistrate
Brann said: .
"It is not." answered the witness. The
witness said he saw Albert T. * Patrick
September 24 at the bank. He said he
wanted to see witness about" a matter,
and then Patrick said to Mr. Swenson
that there would be no probate of Mr.
Rice's will in New York, as he had no
property here. Air. Jones showed an or
der on Swenson & Sons purporting to be
signed by Rice calling on Swrtison &
Sons to deliver his money to him. Wit
ness did not know whether Patrick had
the check with him or not.
"Did you hear him say anything to Mr.
Swenson about a $25,000 check?" asked
lawyer House. - "Yes; he said he desired
to have it certified before it was known
that Mr. Rice was dead," was the reply.
"Did ho use Just Hhose words?" asked
Magistrate Brann. "I don't know."
"Well, what led up to his saying that
he wanted the check certified before
Rice's death was known?" asked the mag
istrate. "I do not remember," responded
the witness.
Mr. Osborne offered fifteen checks to
wh'ch were attached Rice's signatures,
and Mr. Wetherbee identified the signa
tures as those of Mr. Rice. They were
marked for Identification and left in the
keeping of the court. The witness being
shown the $25,000 check said to the best
of his belief the signature was not made
by Rice. -
Witness was asked if he remembered
itavlng a conversation with Jones In Jan
uary. 1900. Tho attorney for the defense
entered a vigorous protest against the
question on the ground that it antedated
the date and time of the offenses with
which the accused are charged.
Walter O. Wetherbee, confidential clerk
in Swenson's banking house, v.-as the next
witness.' He knew Jones as valet and sec
retary of Rice. The witness was handed
the complaint against Patrick and Jones
to which Is attached the $25,000 check,
which is described as "People's Exhibit
No. L" He said he saw the check Sep
tember 24. when it was brought to him
on the occasion of. Its first presentation.
He handed It back to Mr. .Wallace with
Instructions to return it to Mr. Short.
Witness had known Rice sixteen years
and was familiar Â¦with his signature.
Witness was asked: "In your opinion is
the signature on that check the signature
of Mr. Rice?"
Tho cross-examination of this witness
did not materially alter his testimony nor
did It induce any contradiction of the
earlier witnesses.
The first witness to-day was Charles H.
Findlay,- a clerk in the banking house of
Swenson. & Sons. His testimony related
to his acquaintance with Jones as secre
tary and valet of Rice; to seeing David
L. Short at the bank September 24, when
Short presented a $25,000 check payable
to the order of Patrick; to turning over
the check to Walter O. Wetherbee of
Swenson & Sons' Bank for identification,
who compared the signature with that
of about thirty other checks of the dead
millionaire which the bank had. He cor
roborated the testimony given yesterday
as to what was said to Short about the
signature.. Short's return later and to
calling up Jones on the telephone regard-
Ing the check. Witness said he recog
nized Jones' voice on the telephone and
that he told Jones that Rice was wanted
at the telephone. Jones replied that Rice
had been dead since 8 o'clock the day be
fore.
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â The preliminary
hearing of Lawyer Albert T. Patrick and
Valet Charles F. Jones was resumed to
day in the Center-street Police Court.
The charge Is forging and uttering a
check for $25,000 upon Swenson & Sons,
bankers, to which is signed the name of
William R. Rice.

L. F. Sinclair of Georgetown said Golden
told him that Youtsey and Culton were
fools for talking, as they would get noth
ing, for talking. The court adjourned till
Stewart B. Stone of Lexington, who
acted as Governor Taylor'9 stenographer,
saw Youtsey on January 27 In the recep
tion room next the Governor's office with
a gun. looking out of the window, but that
It excited no comment, because everybody
was excited and expected trouble.
James Chlpley of Scott County said that
Culton told him that Wharton Golden had
caused all of them to get Into trouble be
cause Golden wanted a part of the J100.000.
GEORGETOWN. Ky.. Oct. 16.â If Henry
Youtsey heard a word uttered In his trial
to-day he gave not the slightest indication
of It by any movement of the hands, head,
eyes or lips. So far as any one In the
courtroom could tell he neÂ»*cr uttered a
word all day. He was the unconscious
actor In another realistic scene this after
noon, when he wag brought Into the court
room proper, lying on his bed. His eyes
and month were^ closed and he looked
every whit a dead man.
Colonel Xelson/hia lawyer. In a loud
voice asked him how old he was and
where he lived.
The defense presented some strong evi
dence contradictory of the prosecution" j
witnesses and said they have something
stronger for to-morrow, when they ex
pect to rest their case. ?
Jim Howard will go on the stand and
swear that Youtsey did not let him In
Powers' office that morning and that he
was not even in the building. Youtsey s
symptoms have been worse to-day. His
temperature increased and his pulse was
greatly accelerated. The physicians think
he is In no immediate danger, but a sud
den change for the worse may come at
any time.
Mrs. Jlattie Stamper, sister of Wharten
Golden, said she heard Golden say he was
to get 15000 for his testimony and that he
made a confession In order to save his
neck and Governor Taylor's.
C. O. Reynolds and Â£>. B. Walcutt of
Frankfort swore that Culton told him that
he had a contract with the Comonwealth
to secure Immunity.
Porter Thompson Sr. and Porter Thomp
son Jr. said they passed through the hall
of the executive building a few minutes
before the shooting, but saw no men in
the hall. John \v. Davis, one of those
Indicted with Culton, corroborated the
Thompsons.
Rev. Z. T. Cody said Golden told him he
confessed to save himself.

sons that the Grand Jury ln Its report
yesterday urges upon the Bar Associa

Rogers "and his affairs were not the only
matters under discussion by the Grand
Jury yesterday. John M. Chretien, Jacob
Rauer and R. Colthorp were again before
the jury in reference to the Sullivan es
tate. They had practically nothing to
tell, however, and after a short inquirj
were excused, i
The jury came to the conclusion that
the first Indictment preferred against
Frod Hansted for felony ln having de-.
frnuded Jake Rauer out of a certain sum
of money in connection with the estate

was prepared and filed. This new indict
ment csserts that Fred Hansted, alias
"Young Dutchy," feloniously uttered a
fictitious instrument on the Rauer Col
lection Agency for the payment of money
and property of one John Sullivan, a sole
surviving brother and heir at law of Jo

there was then no such person in exist

perpetrated in the Probate Court of Judge
James M. Troutt. Rogers refused to
answer a series of questions asked of
him and was forced to spend five days
in the County Jail for his refusal, ile
was also ordered to pay a line of $500,
but this part of the punishment inflicted
upon him has not yet been carried out.
Rogers justified his refusal to answer
the questions of the Grand Jury on the
ground that he would convict himself of
a felony. The Grand Jury considers that
these facts warrant what it now asks tho
Bar Association to do. The position of
Rogers in the matter has never been the
subject of discussion. It has been per
fectly clear to the general public and to
that exalted part of the public which
chooses to consider itself a body of honor
able men % under the designation of the Bar
Association. Mr. Rogers Is theoretically
as honorable as any member of that as
sociation" and he has confessed that if
he were to tell the truth in reference
to his connection with the crime he would
have a tendency to incriminate himself.
This evidence suggests itself to the ordi
nary mind as being reasonably conclusive
of the fact that James Taylor Rogers
should not be a practicing attorney be

A SERIES of new sensations has

scheming lawyers and other
scoundrels attempted to rob the
estate of Joseph Sullivan in this city. The

this shameless outrage upon the dead.

In open court when Fred Hansted. nllas
"Your.g Dutchy," will be tried for a
felony. Th'.s startling development will
take the form cf a sworn affidavit which
John M. Chretien has made, s-igned and
ewora to in the Countv Jail.
In this affidavit Chretien make? the
startling sworn statement that "Doc"
Edward Weathcrly, the notorious race
track follower, and not Fred Uanstfd,
was the fcan who produced the heir,
formed tbe\>lot and manipulated the pre

bank. Weatherly, he says, carried out
his instructions to the letter and the

to London. After this transaction, which
took place in the .City Prison, "Doc"
Weathcrly and his wife were very at
tentive to Hansted. calling- on him fre
quently while he was at the City Prison
and the County Jail.
They showed him small favors and were
apparently very solicitous for his welfare.
During this time Hansted had kept pos
session of the ' keys to his trunks, but,
wishing to get something from them on
one occasion, and believing that Weath
erly and his wife were honestly his
friends, he gave Weatherly the keys to
his trunks?. This was, several weeks ago
Weatherly returned to the jail with what
Hansted asked for and the prisoner
thought nothing more of the incident until
one day Weatherly called on Hansted and
had on a pair of patent leather shoes
which were suspiciously like a pair
"Young Dutchy" owned. No comment
was made at the time, but , "Young
Dutchy" started a train of thought which
gave him no particular peace of mind.
He heard a tew days ago that Mrs.
"Weatherly had bought a ticket for Chi
cago and her husband had gone to Lon
don. This information explained a great
deal, as the Weatherlys had not been to
see Hansted in some time. Affairs came
to a climax yesterday when Hansted
asked permission to go out of the jail in
the custody of a deputy and Inspect his
trunks. He opened his trunks and made
the interesting discovery- that "Doc"
Weatherly had taken five pounds of gold
nuggets, all the valuable papers that the
trunks contained, several foxskins and
other furs and considerable wearing- ap
parel. "Youns Dutchy" is very firmly
convinced that he has been Injured and
he promlsps all sorts of spectacular per
formances if he ever meets "Doc"
Weatherly. -
The Bar Association of this city has
again been prodded to the performance of
what seems to be, to every intelligent
layman in San Francisco, a long delayed
and very evident duty. The Grand Jury
emphatically made recommendation yes
terday to the Bar Association that it
take steps to t-ecure the disbarment of
James Taylor Rogers, who was so notori
ously connected with tho attempted rob
bery of the Sullivan estate. Public opin
ion in a variety of ways and upon various
occasions has demanded such action from
the Bar Association and now, the Grand
Jury, which is thoroughly in possession of
the facts ln the case, adds its urging to
the general demand.
In a preliminary report rendered by the
Grand Jury yesterday to presiding Su
perior Judge George H. Bahrs, the offl
cial inquisitors recommend the disbar
ment of Jnmes Taylor Rogers. Rogers
it will be remembered refused positively
to reveal his connection with the crime
Hanst-d says that when he came here he
bad considerable money and was fearful
that It mlpht be taken away from him
ar.d that he might lose it. He had $1200.
he says, in bank notes, hidden in a belt
which he wore around his waist. He gave
this to "Doc" Weatherly and cautioned
him to place it in his own name and not
"Doc" Weatherly and his wife were
even more fearful of the reappearance of
"Young Dutchy" than they had been ap
parently at the first publication of the
scandal. They were constantly ln Han
sted's company from the moment of his
ntrival in this city. They were the first
to greet him and held long- private con
versations with him and last night Han
sted tcld in th*Â» County Jail what he
claims was the result of that intimacy.
He claims that the Weatherlys deliber
ately robbed him of practically everything
he had in the world, even his shoes.
Further than this Chretien asserts Han
stfd had nothing to do with the case.
This In outline is the affidavit which Chre
tien has made and which Hansted pos
sesses. Chretien enters into very elab
orate details, giving dates and places of
meeting with Weatherly and his wife and
their discussions in reference to the es
tate. According to the affidavit W'eather
ly was the arch conspirator who brought
the bogus heir out of obscurity. When
The Call made its expose Weatherly was
palpably excited and disturbed. He and
his wife haunted the newspaper offices
and the men who had been accused and
seemed fearful of every development m
the case. Their fears were Quieted, how
ever, until the return of Fred- Hansted

never knew the true name of the bogus

discovered soon after the appearance of
tho impostor, however, that his new ac
quaintance was? a drunkard, very unre

that after he br carr.e attorney for the ab
sent heirs he approached "Doc" Weath

Weatberly had lived In London and was
familiar with that great city. He asked
Weatherly in reference to streets, locali
tics and various places of buFine?s and In
asking this Information save his reasons,
stating that he was looking for a John
Sullivan, who was heir to a $5000 estate
in this city.
John M. Chretien, who has been sentenced to serve ten years for
a crime, has added a new sensation to the scandalous story of the con
spiracy to rob the estate of Joseph Sullivan. Chretien has made, signed
and acknowledged before a notary an affidavit accusing "I>oc" Edward
Weathcrly of having been the conspirator in chief by producing the
bogus heir and insisting upon his presentation in court.
FrÂ»d Hansted, alias "Young Dutchy," who will be tried next week
for his participation in the affair, supplements Chretien's sensational
affidavit by the startling assertion that "Doc" Weatherly and his wife
have robbed him of $1200 in bank notes, $1000 in gold nuggets, valu
able wearing apparel, skins and many private papsrs and have fled to

Ready to Litigate Over an
Assessment That Has
â¢ Been Voted.
' * " ~ â ~*~7
There 'is trouble, among the stockhold
ers of El Carmen Mining and Milling
Company, which is operating In Mexico
with offices in this city. There are sev
eral phases, of . the controversy. One al
leged grievance that. is. about to result in
legal proceedings is that an- assessment
has been levied on the stock. The direc
tors of the company are Calvin D. Brown.
J. W. Wright, Herman. Murphy, H. An
derson and W. A. Caldwell. Papers in a
suit against them and also against the
company will be filed by Attorney H. M.
Owens to-day.. In the complaint the court
.will be asked to make an order restrain
ing the defendants from proceeding to
collect the assessment pending, compell
ing them to make an accounting and ap
pointing a receiver to take charge of and
operate the mine.
The complainant Is Newell Winants.
Calvin D. Brown, one of the defendants,
is superintending the operation of the
mine., He Is a dentist. The assessment
has been ordered since he began to man
age- he succeeding Winants.. In the com
plaint that has been prepared it is al-
t se :L * at Brown . who is employed by
tne directors, Vhnd never any experience
at allas-a miner, .but had practiced den
tistry in the city and county of San Fran
cisco for several years prior to his em
ployment as manager and superintend
ent. It is also set forth that the di
rectors have not kept a record of all their
business transactions, and that they have
mismanaged affairs; also that they have
refused to account to the plaintiff and to
other stockholders concerning the amount
or rwoney received from the working of
the mine and their expenditures.
The trouble, of which the suit brought
by Winants. is the culmination, has been
brewing for, some time. Winants pre
pared a typewritten statement, in which
he attacked the management of the com
pany s propet-ty and then sent out no
tices to the stockholders to visit the of
llces of H. M. Owens and read the state
ment. One of the allegations then made
was that" from $15,000 to $;50,000 in gold had
been pormitted : to run away into a creek.
There were many other statements con
cerning jillcged waste and mismanage
ment. The directors have been inclined
to make lieht of Winants' complaint.
Now the issues will be determined in
court.
The company is capitalized for $200 000
the stock being divided Into 200,000 shares.

WOMEN WHO SEEK REDRESS
IN LOCAL POLICE COURTS
Thirdâ He has managed to straddle platforms
the major part of which I repudiate.' â¢
Fourthâ Mr. Bryan has plnced fabricated is
sues before the people â imperialism, trusts and
government by injunction.
Fifthâ I refused to vote for Mr. Bryan in
1S96 because of 16 to 1 and other planks of
the Chlcajro platform, and \ as that platform
was re-enacted at Kansas City I cannot see
any logical reason why I should support htm
now. However. I do not occupy thÂ» fame posi
tion as I did in 189G-this time I shall vote for
McKinley.
Every Dredlctlon Mr. Bryan made in 1S96 has
been falsified, and. I believe a change in ad
ministration at this time particularly unde
sirable. I regard Mr. Bryan's theory of Dem
ocracy as disturbing and un-American, j We
have the demonstration before us in his pre
dictions of 1S9G that he Is a man of unsound
Judgment, and a man of unsound Judgment Is
not fit to be President of the United States.
Is there a man In tho whole country who
would pay that he desires to see America con
verted into an empire? Mr. McKinley has
never said so. There Is no Issue of Imperial
ism. I doubt if there is a man- residing any
where In the United .States who .desires any
chance In .our Vprlnclpk-s of government. Im
perialism does not. but expansion In Asia does
disturb the American- mind, but that must be
settled irrespective of party and the agitation
nov.' Is due mainly to. the .desire to create a
diverting issue. The campaign so far has been
one of false Issues, of which the most false
Is Imperialism; 'â¢ Â¦'
Personal!:' I am opposed to the retention of
the Philippines, but when my country's flag
was advanced in the "war with Spain, my sym-
Dathies were with the soldiers and sailors of
the. United States. Xo-proud nation has ever
been bo thoroughly subdued, at so little expense
In money and life, as . the monarchy of Spain
by the republic of the United States. But for
tho treaty of Paris the issue which Mr. Bryan
has tried to foist upon 'the American people
would not be possible, and yet he Is the man
who is responsible. /for Its acceptance.
What are we going to do with the Philip
pines? Are we going to leave them?. Or are
we going to do what an honest/ self-respecting
nation will always doâ support the President In
his effort to pacify the islands and then when
tho time comes fight out in the halls of- Con
gress the question of what form of government
shall be established, or whether the islands are
to be retained at all.
Mr. Bryan says the trusts are an issue. The
Kansas City platform .says the' same. The
Republican platform says , what any common
sense man ought to sayâ that" there' "are good
and bad combinations, but that any combina
tion Involving: a conspiracy is illegal and should
be suppressed. It Is to the credit of the Ile'
publlcan party that the only national anti-trust
law was passed by a Republican Congress and
signed by a Republican President." '
The real Issues of the campaignâ one of them
Is European democracy. Whenever a Euro
pean traitor comes into my country with his
brutal red flag to cause riot and bloodshed
I am In favor of hanging that man. I will
not eay that Mr. Bryan sympathizes with that
element, but every man of them desires Mr.
Bryan's election. .
Would or would not Bryan, In case of his
election, be bound to bring every pressure to
bear to derange the currency of the United
States and to establish the free coinase of
sliver? If he would, do you want him for
President? The prosperity of the United States
In the last four years Is appalling in Its Im
mensity. Granted that parties do not create
prosperity, suppose that Mr. Bryan had been
elected in 1S96. . Suppose that free coinage of
silver had been, established. There could have
been no greater calamity to the country.
The paramount issue Is the election of Mr.
Bryan and the introduction of free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to L
An address unique among the political
speeches of the campaign was that of
Henry E. Highton at Metropolitan Tem
ple last night. Mr. Highton, a life-long
Democrat, who is still a Democrat, and is
unalterably opposed to the retention of
the Philippines and to the protective tar
iff, championed the cause of McKinley
with all the earnestness and logic and
hammer-and-tongs vigor, for which he is
noted jkh an advocate, and aimed at the
apostle of end-of-the-century Democracy
thrusts of logic and sarcasm such as no
Republican orator has employed.
The audience filled the temple and en
thusiasm was at a high pitch. A largo
number of well-known Democrats were
present.
Senator Gutter, secretary of the State
Central Committee, presided as chairman
of the evening. In calling the meeting to
order he said:
"Among the accessions to the Repub
lican party In this State there is none
more prominent or able than the gentle
man who will address you this evening.
It is my pleasant duty to introduce Mr.
Henry E. Hlghton."
Mr. Hlghton was received with prolong
ed applause. He spoke in part as follows:
Ladles and gentlemen: There has been placed
in my hands a circular in which- my views in
opposition to the annexation of Hawaii are set
forth. I will say to those who prepared that
circular that I am not here for the purpose
of taking back any statements of mine which
were the result of mature deliberation. 'One
of the res sons for my being here Is that Im
perialism is a false Issue.*
In my view It Is easily demonstrable that In
the. Republican platforms of 1896 and 1900 Dem
ocrats can find a better exposition of Demo
cratic principles than" In the Chicago and Kan
sas City platforms. The Republican organiza
tion of this day is largely inoculated with the
true spirit of Democracy.
The constitution shields alike the wage-earner
and the capitalist. There are in all ' parties
capitalists who seek their own ends In a back
ward revolution. Labor also has Its dema
gogues. But the great mass of the people. Ir
respective of party, respect the guarantees of
our liberties and desire to see nothing but
equal rights before the law prevail.
European '.Democracy Is the muddy stream
that has flowed from Old World Institutions;
it ha? no adaptability to American conditions
or institutions. I am not here to do otherwise
than slory in American Democracy, and 1
have no apology to make -.'-for. It. Jefferson,
Jackson and Cleveland need no sponsors for
their places in history..
There j is not to-day in the United States ! a
single representative of | European Democracy
who does not look to Mr. Bryan as his leader.
I am opposed to Mr. Bryan for these reasons:
Firstâ If he be, a Democrat," . I am not.
Â¦ Secondâ Judging from his speeches and writ
ten statements he is essentially a Populist, and
that means a European socialist.

BRYANISM AND
FALSE ISSUES
THAT DECEIVE
Oakland ORlce San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Oct. 16.
A work train ran Into the rear of a
freight train in the midst of a fog this
morning near San Leandro. The train
men escaped by jumping, and the only one
who suffered any injury was Eddie Jones,
a newsboy, who was thrown a considera
ble distance and miraculously escaped
with his life. The wreck delayed the
morning travel from Haywards, Xilea and
LJvermore.
The accident, occurred a few moments
after 6 o'clock. There was a thick, low
fog hanging over the lowlands about San
Leandro. The regular morning freight
for Han Jose had left San Leandro sta
tion, proceeding toward Its destination.
Shortly afterward a special work train
bound for Niles and going in the same
direction as the freight train got its or
ders at San Leandro and started down
the track in the same direction. The spe
cial work train was composed of two en
gines and a caboose only, and being very
light started to make fa3t time toward Its
destination.
Suddenly the train men on the regular
freight saw the work train looming up
through the fog, and at the same moment
Engineer Cushing of the special train saw
the rear of the regular. The engineer ap
plied his brakes and reversed hts engine,
but it was too late. The fog had hidden
the train until it was too late to check
his special and the latter crashed into the
rear of the regular.
- The engine drove the caboose of the
regular train upon a coal car In front, and
the force was sufficient to wreck the coal
car as well.
Conductor J. Ward of the regular train
was in the caboose at the time, and with
his brakeman jumped, avoiding injury.
Eddie Jones, a newsboy who was going to
Haywards to meet an. incoming train, was
not so fortunate. He was asleep on a
seat, and when the collision came he was
thrown into the air and over some
timbers. Strange to say, his only injuries
were a few bruises.
The passengers on some of the morning
trains for Oakland had to be transferred
around the wreck.
The collision might have been avoided
