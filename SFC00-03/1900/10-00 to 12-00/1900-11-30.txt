and boys, " when hospital scenes > had
passed in terrifying succession, San Fran
cisco closed s gloomiest day of Thanks
giving. - ' '
The accident was terrifying in every de
tail. Just before the great game between
Stanford and Berkeley began at the Rec
reation Grounds on Sixteenth and Folsom ,
streets many of the thdusands oV men
and women who crowded the park noticed
that across' the street on Sixteenth "and '
Folsom streets a crowd of men and boys, \
numbering between 400 and 500, had'gath- .
ered on. the corrugated iron roof of. thÂ« '
San Francisco and Pacific Glass Works.,
Many who saw this little eager band of i
sjÂ«Htators ir.ade the comment that the)
perch upon v.hkh they were seemed frali ;
and poorly adapted for sustaining their
weight. The rival university teams were"
just coming. upon the field. The parhsanaJ
of the cardinal and the blue* and gold!
were -waving their brilliant,, banners, Â¦"
cheering, shouting, gesticulating in the'
very 'climax of enthusiasm.
The ball had Just been tossed into the :
air when with sound of rumbling thunder' J
the roof upon which the band of. men and' \
boys were, stationed gave way and the j
black mass of humanity upon it disap-'!
pcared like a flash of darknesg into light, i
Three hundred human beings had shot
through the roof to the blazing furnace
more than seventy feet below. The shrieks
of the unfortunate beings could not be
heard above the cheers of those who were
watching the game within the Inclosure'
of IlecrenUon Park. The great game was'
on, but death was playing sad havoc with-;
in a stone's throw of where. there, was en-'
tJmslasm. life and the excitement which
comes with contentment. .
Men were roasting to death upon the
white-hot surface of the terrible furnace.!
Their clothing was ablaze and their flesh
was scorching until the air was permeated
with the terrible odor. Boiling oil was
pouring upon their bodies. They lay upon
the floor with their bones broken* their
skulls .crushed, their life ; flashing out,
while the cheers were, sounding from the
adjacent, park. Poor creatures .hung in
desperation upon broken bÂ»ams fifty, feet
above the concrete floor.- Below them
were human bodies piled in a heap, writh
ing in.' the torture ' of. which unconscious
ness had not deprived them. The descend
ing mass of humanity had /twisted the
iron stanchions of the furnace and had
broken the boards of the platforms.
The scene was a veritable hell of an
guish. These, men and .boys had come to
their terrible injury and death through
their desire to see the great intercollegiate
match.' They had forced their -way
through the gates of the large inclosure
of the glass works. : They' had? climbed
over the fences. .It* is said that' they" h'ad
bribed the watchman for the privilege of
going to their death, butthe police, after
what they deemed, to be a thorough in
vestigation, are unable to prove that any
one paid money for. the right to enter the
incjosure and asceiid. to the roof. These
men and boys went- into Jlhe inclosure like

Â£^ iL^U uj* HANKPGIVIXG DAY ha*
T {t passed Into the history of
|1 San Francisco as a day of
Â£ horror. While the people of
g the city were in the midst
i <{ the festivities with
Â¦"^ which they marked their
celebration of an occasion
cf thanks to Providence.
dokth'came upon thorn in Its most, horrify
.lug form.- Just as the great football game
between Stanford aivl Berkeley started
yesterday aTlPrnoon. hundreds of people
were hurloj through a roof down to tor
ture, torment and dpath. Just as cheer
Ijpon cheer can.e from thousand* of
throaifc. in the groat arena where the coi-
Ipglaf: contest was about to begin, and
Jutt a? flags were waving, men were
cheering, women were en their feet ap
plauding the rival athletes, hundreds of
men tveie plunging through the air not a
clone's throw away.
They fell upon the white-hot furnace
that was blazing with its fires in the
newly erected establishment of the San
Fianci=co and Pacific Glass Works. As
the cheers arose in tremendous volume
from Kecreatlon Park, there was the
sound cf rumbling thunder from across
the ctreet and the shrieks # of men and
boys precipitated down to death. It was,
perhaps, the most horrifying accident that
ever happened in San Francisco.
It threw a pall of sadness over the great
fettival of the day and cast the city Into
a gloom which could not be dispelled.
Thousands of men and women thronged
around the place where the dread accident
had happened. Hundreds of men gave
their help to thoEe who were burned and
had been tortured in their fall fr^m the
roof. Thrr* were the shout.Â« a:xl cries of
the police, the piteous appeal of weeping
women and excited men, the hurrying con
fusion of wagons, ambulances, carriages
and any vehicle that could be brought into
command. People, frantic in terror and
dread apprehension, fled from the place
to eÂ©ek information at the various hospi
tals ar.d at the city's house of the dead.
Great thrones gathered around the va
rious hospitals long before the stretchers
bearing: the wounded, the dying, and, !n
*ome Instances, the dead, arrived. Emcr
c-ncy calls were sent to the Fire De
partment and to the police; physicians
summoned from every part of the

TERRIBLE ROSTER OF DEAD AND INJURED.
The San Francisco Call.At 8 o'clock last night the thoroughfare
in front of the Southern Pacific Hospital
at : Fourteenth and Mission streets was
impassable.- It was black with agonized
men and women. They pleaded in vain to
be admitted to the hospital, where in ev
ery i room -there was some ; suffering being
who was paying his price, for seeing the
football game. . The accident happened at
2:30 o'clock. : - Within fifteen minutes after
that a man with blood-stained hands ap
peared : at the hospital; and asked assist
ance. * In his insane^ excitement he ; was
barely,, able to tell , the single. doctor, in at
tendance that a terrible accident' had hap
pened and ; assistance [ was ',' needed. . ' The
physician in J charge instantly telephoned
for- the<;entire staff of .; physicians and
nurses. Â¦ and within" half an'hourthe'hos-
. In an hour there was nothing In the
place to tell of the terrible accident ex
cept the gaping opening in the roof, the
broken r rafters, the twisted, stanchions
and the blood-stained floor. Nurses, phy
sicians and the Coroner had come and
gone, v and San Francisco was beginning
to know of the most horrifying accident an
the history of its people. When the ter
rible event had become generally known
in the city terror reigned. Thousands
upon thousands of people had a right -to
fear that some one dear to them, had met
death. Every hospital" was surrounded by
black masses of, people, kept back by: the
police. There "was weeping and pleading
and threatening^ for the privilege of en
tering and inspecting the- wounded" and
dying until far, into the night, when the
names and Identity of the wounded .and
dead had been established. '
gj It was an appalling sight. The news
of the disaster had spread with the rapid
ity of wildfire." Thousands in eager, dread
ing anticipation begged the privilege of
getting â¢ near so that they might satisfy
and rest their minds that their loved ones
were, not among those of the dead.
Mounted policemen beat back the crowd,
and now and again the silence of the
dreadful place was broken by the echoing
cheers from the field where the university
athletes were striving for victory. l Punc
tuating >â¢' the groans and the .occasional
shriek j of . some man or boy were the
shouts of people who knew nothing of
the death that was so near to- them.
All haste and all endeavors were made
to obtain assistance; Messages were sent
to the County Hospital, to St. Luke's Hos
pital .and to the Southern Pacific Hos
pital; doctors were summoned, the Cor
oner was notified, and physicians from
every part of the city were Importuned
to come in all haste to the place. Ve
hicles of every description were pressed
into service to carry the unfortunate ven
turesome â¢ men and ! boys to the various
hospitals. Express wagons bore away
their burdens of suffering beings. Car
riages were given up by indulgent own
ers. Men on horseback lifted up uncon
scious boys and_carried them where
medical aid' might be obtained.
event. So great was the heat of this fur
nace that perspiration streamed from
the faces of the workmen, and as the
thundering crash came and human bodies
were flying downward through the air to
death and tormenting injury these men
stood aghast. . - â¢ ,â¢
They were paralyzed in horror and'no*
before the clothing of those' upon the
furnace was burning und their cries of
agony were sounding through the place
did they recover sense enough to act. .One
by one they dragged the suffering creat
ures from the furnace to the concrete
floor of the building.. Quickly the fire was
put out from their clothes. One by ono
the unfortunate victims of the disaster
were laid upon the floor until more than
sixty, the dead with the dying, those that
were writhing in the very ecstacy.of pain
and those that were still In insensibility,
were side by side. *
cers to the scene. Mounted Officer J. A.
Hayes was'among the first on the scene,
and he. procured a ladder, with which he
took ' down a number of men Who "were
clinging to a broken rafter in the front of
the building.
â¢ "From Information later received I am
satisfied that some one collected money
to -permit some of the <crowd to get
through the -gates or over the adjoining
fences. My men are now Investigating, a
report that a sign offering seats for sale
was posted on one of the fences, and that
it disappeared after the accident. We are
also looking for several parties who claim
to have known of this practice."
SYMPATHY FOR. OOM .,
PAUL KRUGER IS VOTED
Resolution Is Adopted With Tre
mendous- Cheering by â¢ the
, French Chamber of Dsputies
PARIS, Nov. 29.â In the Chamber .of
Deputies to-day M. Cochery, the acting
president" of the body, announced -that
M. Denys Cochin, Conservative, ' repre
senting, a district of the Seine, had pre
sented an, interpellation as to the inten
tions of the Government regarding arbi
tration in favor of the Boers.
Â¦ The Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Del
casse, replied that there was no use in
opening a debate on this subject, as In
foreign policy, especially, such discus
sions were useless and often dangerous.
At.M. Cochery's request, M. Denys
Cochin withdrew his interpellation and
proposed the following motion:
"The Chamber of Deputies on. the oc
casion of the arrival of the President of
the Transvaal in France, is happy to ad
dress, to him a sincere expression of its
respectful sympathy."
M. Cochery then announced. that he had
received another motion from*M. Four
niere. Socialist, representing one of the
Alsne divisions, couched In the following
terms:. -.' .'.
. " 'The Chamber of Deputies, while ex
pressing sympathy for English Demo
cracy ' "Â¦â¢â¢Â¦-. â¢ '
Here the reading of the motion was In
terrupted by loud protests, but M, Coch
ery proceeded: 'â¢ â¢ .
" 'Sends its greeting to President Kru
ger.' " â¢
Continuing, M. Cochery begged tho
Chamber to refrain from demonstrations,
which, he said, could be badly interpre
ted. - He also asked that a vote- be taken
without any. discussion. . ,
The motion of M. Denys Cochin was
then adopted unanimously and the 559
voters cheered when, the result was an
nounced.
M. Fourniere, after declaring- that the
democracies of , all countries were - ani
mated; by the Â¦- same pacific sentiments,
withdrew his own -.motion. .'Â¦. 'â¢â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦"
: Mr. Kruger will leave here Saturday for
Cologne. Tha hour of his departure has
not been fixed. He will remain at Cologne
over Sunday and Â»est. On Monday ho
will go to Madgeburg and thence to Ber
lin, .where he, expects to arrive Tuesday
morning. â¢ . ' â¢
Mr. Kruger passed the day receiving a
number of deputations. Including delega
tions from the Chamber of Deputies, who
after. the vote in the Chamber immediate
ly proceeded to the Hotel Scribe and com
municated it to him. Mr. Kruger, who
was much touched, warmly shook hands
with the Deputies. . ;

On top of the furnace, where still played

Josepn Gumper, "who 'resides at 1013
Green street, was among'those on the roof
who escaped falling. He hurried below
into the furnace-room, and was among the
first to go to the assistance of the in
jured.
"There were over fifty -- persons either
deaJ or injured lying among the wreckage
when I got down." he said. "I helped pii 1
tome cf the victims from t He top of the
furnace and did all I could for the wound
ed until the police arrived and drove me

a moment failed to Velase their hold its
â¢wright would have been added to theirs
and the list of dead would' have been
greater. As it was, those who fell from
the broken timber, with the- exception of
one or two escaped Instant death, though
all were frightfully wounded. .
"Blood was everywhere, but even those
who fear to Bee death coming, to. those
of their, kind and to whom the sight of
blocd Is a horror would not have left the
scene. All worked with â¢ frenzied haste,
and for this' many escaped death who
otherwise would have roasted alive on the
furnace."
It was behind this iron band that many
of the victims were caught and' neld' until
relief by rescue or death came to- them.
(Four-inch timbers, supporting the plat
form frame that surrounds the furnace,
were crushed by the falling bodies, and
here and- there blood clots, bits of flesh
and even splintered bones showed where
death or frightful injury had come to one
of the many unfortunates.
Iron Bands Hold Victims to the Heat
Until Aid Arrives.
IMPRISONED ON THE FURNACE.
Some who had fallen uppermost and es
caped practically uninjured rushed terror
stricken from the scene. The maimed and
bleeding victims of the tragedy who had
fallen away from the furnace to the
sanded floor lay or sat or kneeled and
with hands before their faces shut out
the terrible scene of death. Around the
vaulted fire pit an iron band, strong
enough to resist the efforts of the gen
erated gas to burst the furnace walls
apart, was bent and twisted by the weight
of falling bodies.
Begrimed workmen, at fir.st appalled by
the ghastly tragedy, soon rushed to Â»he
aid of the injured and "to care for the
dead. Burning bodies were dragged from
the furnace top and cast aside that the
living rnipht be rescued. All the while
far up under the gable a terrible fight for
ltfe was being fought. .Half a. score. of
men and boys, whose plunge toward-death
had been stopped for the instant by a
broken girder, hung to its broken end.
Slowly it" bent beneath the weight, upon
it until the palsied hands of, the victims
were loosed and they plunged seventy
feet below to swell the list of dead and
maimed. ' _
of the maimed, as they writhed In agony
to escape the torture of the inferno be
neath, there mingled the sickly odor of
burning flesh that grew crisp in the blasts
from the seething furnace, i And dead
eves, with those of the living, looked
blankly on every scene of horror.
About on every side lay the crushed
and mangled slain. From the features
of some, distorted by the agonies that
followed death, the blood trickled to form
dark clots In their own shadows, but
more awful than all was the scene atop
the furnace. Like a fire srap the iron
bands that stretched around held its vic
tims to the death-giving heat. ' One body,
dead from concussion from the fall, rolled
down the slope of the furnace top and
passed beneath the blow flame, whose
heat turned the sand beneath to molten
glass. Slowly the hissing shaft of flame
ate its way through the flesh of the un
fortunate beneath, and the flesh still
quivered, for even death resented such
cruel torture. . . â¢ â¢- â¢

DETAILS OF THE TRAGEDY.
Â«tp=*v EATH rode the mighty wave of
\\ enthusiasm that greeted the
/ 1 fl I*>ning of the game. Up to the
'*Â¦ sf hour when the shrill pipe of the
referee's whistle called- the
teams: to line, silence reigned in and
about the glass works, save for the muf
fled cough of the escape pipes of the east
furnace, whose capping glowed red from
the molten mass within. Through the
gates and over the fence of the glass
Â¦works, square, which incloses the block
bounded by Harrison and Folsom, Four
teenth and Fifteenth streets, a crowd,
eager to witness the intercollegiate con
test, surged and hurried toward the fac
tory.
Many youngsters, spurred by the enthu
siasm cf youth, reached the building,
found moans of access to the roof and
were seated astride the ventilator before
the manaKement of the factory was aware
of the rush to gain points of vantage on
top of the building. An attempt was
made when the rush was discovered to
prevent other expectant pleasure seekers
from gaining the roof. Workmen were
called from the furnaces and, armed with
bars, made strenuous efforts to stay the
human tide, but without result. Boys and
men. some young, others near middle age
fought for positions on the roof. Oyer an
insecure plank laid from a building in
course of construction, the heights of
which wfre gained by means of the build
ers' ladders, to the factory proper the
enthusiasts hurried, while others impa
tient to see the game climbed the damper
chains of the chimney or scaled from
brace to brare to the roof. Warnings,
threats and pleadings, curses and prayers
failr-d to convey jo them the danger of
' their position.
Convinced of the ust-lessness of further
efforts on thHr part to dislodge the cÂ»ccu
p; r.ts of the roof, the management of the
plaKs works sought the aid of the police.

lay near the head of the furnace. "An

and, the oil blast and the flame had eaten

and I will live through all this horror

A young man, who refused to give his
address even to the surgeons who treated
him, also told a story, tragic in its de
tail. â¢ â¢ , -Â¦
"I felt myself falling," he 'said, "then I
felt the heat of what 1 now know was the

Such was the scene of this appalling
tragedy. All- of the terrible details .: will

When the wagons and carriages and
ambulance began to arrive everything
was in readiness. Patients In the hospital,
crippled, ill to the last degree, hurried
from room to room, hastening with their
blankets and their pillows to places where
the Injured could be received. More than
thirty-five men and boys were carried
into that hospital, and even under the sad
circumstances it is a congratulation that
the officers, physicians and nurses of the
Southern Pacific Hospital performed a
service so thoroughly and so conscien

people of the city.
In this accldeflt. in which a dozen people

When the accident became known Mayor
Phelan went without delay to the scene
of the disaster and made every possible
investigation, interviewing the proprie
tors, the managers, the superintendent
and the workmen. He went then to the
various hospitals and interviewed those
who had been injured. The police, under

The lazy man's bed Is too short for him
because he is too long in It.
SHORTLY after it became known
that many had been killed and in
jured hundreds of anxious moth
ers and fathers hurried to the
Morgue and with trembling lips
inquired if their children were among the
dead. For a tjjne Merchant street, where
the Morgue is situated, was blocked with
people, the majority of whom tearfully
and fearfully waited for the list of the
dead to be given out. As the Morgue wag
ons brought in the bodies of victims of
the catastrophe the crowd of anxious
parents and relatives surged around the
vehicles, momentarily" expecting to view
the mangled remains of their loved ones.
In order to facilitate the work of receiv
ing the dead the Coroner and the depu
ties opened the new Morgue on Dunbar
alley, the old quarters being wholly in
adequate for the purpose. In a short
time the slabs in both places were occu
pied by victims of the awful accident. .
The lirst to be taken to the Morgue was
William H. Eckfeld, aged 12 years, and
who resided at 1&20 Howard street. His
mangled body was conveyed there In u
grocer's wagon. As the Coroner's depu
ties tenderly lifted his bleeding body

crowd were forced to turn away. A short
time atterward the father of the unfor
tunate boy appeared at the city's dead
house ana Inquired if his. son's name wtfs
among the list oi the dead. He was al
lowed inside,, and alter viewing the
bodies ol several of the victims he sud-
Ueniy recognized the Distorted tace of nia

sala that he had warned his son not to
try to see tne game, as he was likely to
get injured.
"TVhy did he not heed my advice?"
tearfully asked the grief-stricken parent
of the sympathetic onlookers. "Oh, if he
hail not left the house he would have
Deen spared to me."
Raising the sheet that had been placed
over tnt body, Eckfeld gazed on the face
of his chiid and passionately kissed his
battered lorehead.
"1 wi.'i soon follow him," sadly remark
ed EcKfeUl, as he left the Morgue; "this
awful aftair nas broken my heart."
A few minutes later the body of Edgar
Fairhaven, aged 9 years, was brought in.
His skull had been fractured and he had
been internally injured. He was identi
ried by a relative, who, on learning of the
accident, went to the Morgue to rind the
little fellow's body occupying a slab.
. The bodies of William Valencia and
Thomas Rippon were next brought In.
Rippon's skull was fractured and his
body frightfully mangled. A number of
his friends visited the Morgue .and gazed
with tear-stained faces on the remains of
their former companion. Valencia was
a grandson of the illustrious capitalist
of that name and after whom Valencia
street v.-as named.
By means of some papers found In his
pockets the remains of James A. Mul
roney were identified. It Is claimed that
he had recently arrived here from Spo
kane, Washington.
Charles Graber identified the body of
Mette Van Dyk. He informed the Coro
ner that Van Dyk. or Van Dura, as he
was sometimes known, arrived in this city
from Nome a short time ago. Since com
ing here he had been living with friends
on Jones street, between Geary and
O'Farrell. Talleyrand Harwell, aged IS
years, was the next to be identified. He
lived at 212 Utah street with his parents.
His mangled body was- identified by hla
brother. Â¦ â¢ . ,
The body of Â¦ Charles Monaghan, aged 30
years, was identified by some papers
which were found In his pockets. It Is
supposed that he lived In Santa Clara, as
there was a check found on him which
had been drawn on the Santa Clara Bank.
. Robert Miller, aged 15 years, another ol
the unfortunate victims, was identified by
a friend. The boy was employed as a
messenger In the store of Nathan, Dohr
mann & Co.. and was held In high esteem
by his employers.
' Moses Ottenstein. who was also killed,
was a cripple. He lived at 923 Folsom
street. His body was horribly mangled.

noble work succoring the injured. The
patients were distributed all over the
hospital wherever a spare bed ; could ;â¢ be
found. The nurses, also did -' everything
they could for, the comrort of the wound
ed. Those treated here were as follows :
Among the visitors was Mayor Phelan.
He encouraged the surgeons in their ef
forts and inquired as to whether they
needed assistance. The only complaint
made was regarding the slowness of the
ambulances to res-pond' to the calls to take
the wounded to their homes after the sur
geons had attended to them. Dr. Gardner
said that it was always the case that the
ambulances were slow iu times of emer
gency.
These and like cries from children in
agony rent the air. Through it all went
mothers and sisters and fathers and
brothers, with white faces, tear bedewed,
stooping here to scrutinize the face of an
unconscious boy on the floor. "No, thank
God, It isn't Jimmy!" and then they went
on to the next and the next, and when
they came to the loved one even the cal
loused nurses and doctors, accustomed as
they were to such scenes, turned their
heads away. #
There were about a score of railroad
men In the building convalescing, anil
when the victims of the accident were
brought in. the brave, whole-hearted fel
lows hobbled down from their rooms on
their crutches, each with his pillow under
his arm to put under the head" of one of
the bleeding boys.
Mingling unostentatiously among the
crowd was a fine-looking, stalwart Roman
Catholic priest with curly hair and wear
ing the long black gown of his profession.
To such of the boys as he learned v.-ere of
his faith he administered such spiritual
consolation as the exigency of the case
see.med to demand. He was Father Allen
of St. Ignatius.
To one entering the hospital the scene
was that of a battle-field after a hand-to
hand encounter. Little boys in knee
breeches were laid on the floor all along
the length of the hall, some writhing with
pain and calling for mother and father,
others lying as though asleep with bloody
and blackened faces. The sitting-rooms,
the offices, the parlors, the operating
rooms were paved with these innocents,
suffering exponents of blood and pain.
Threading their way among these, step
ping over boys with broken legs and shat
tered arms, went the wh.te-aprjned nurses
and the white-gowned surgeons, picking
up one unconscious form after another
and bearing them into the operating
room. First-aid bandages were applied
by the nurses to the patients awaiting
their turn on the torture table. The air
was heavy with the strong odor of anti
septics. The visitor did not need to in
quire the way to the operating-room; he
could hear the suffering boys shrieking
for papa and mamma to take them away.
"Oh! my arm; Go away! You hurt me!
Mamma! mamma! take me home!"
structed the steps, they besieged the
doors, shrieking the names of their loved
ones and demanding admission. The po
lice who had been se_nt to the hospital to
assist In receiving the wounded were ob
liged to use their clubs to force a passage
through the crowd for the maimed vic
tims and their bearers. One young
woman, adown whose cheeks the tears
were streaming, was approached by a
small boy, who Informed her that he was
on the roof and he had seen her 12-year
old brother go down upon the red-hot
oven of molten glass. She moaned In
agony and sank to the sidewalk, and the
police picked her up and sent her away
in a hack.
Hacks, express wagons, police wagons,
butcher carts and almost every kind of
vehicle that happened to be near the
scene of the accident were pressed into
service to carry the patients to the hos
pital. When the unconscious forms were
being taken up the steps to the front
doors a crowd of several hundred people
gathered opposite the building. The great
er number of them were women, mothers
who had missed their sons, and sisters,
who Â¦ feared .that r their., brothers;- were
among the unlucky, ones who had gone to
the roof of the glass works. They ob-

with bleed and ho was on the point of

nurses bound up his wounds and he went

The admirable discipline at the South
ern Pacific Hospital was a noteworthy
feature. Only a few of the employes were
in the building at the time the first report
of the accident was received, but Dr. G.
W. Ogden quickly got them together.
A few minutes after the alarm of fire
had been sounded a young man. hl3 face
and hands scratched and bloody, rang the
front door bell and asked-for a doctor. Dr.
Ogden responded to the summons, and be
ing informed that several persons- had
been injured by the fall of a roof,, re
quested his visitor to sit down. The doc
tor went to the telephone and called up
the entire staff of the hospital. The visit
or refused to give his name, but after
his wounds were dressed, remarked:- "I've
got to get back in a hurry: I've some
friends over there lying on the oven, and
I want to get them out." He then shot
out of the door and that was the- last
seen of him.
All through the evening the Receiving
Hospital was enthronged by anxious in
quirers. Some called to visit the sick;
others were an:;ious parents looking in
vain for children that had not returned
home. Dr. Bunnell allowed relatives to
enter the wards and sit by the side of the
sufferers, but members of the morbid and
curious crowd that always collect at the
hospital on occasions of this kind were
not admitted. Every bed in the men's
ward was occupied and the groans and
screams of the sufferers were heart
breaking. Miss Rose Kane, Mrs. Swett
and Miss Hart, the regular female nurses
in thf hospital, moved from cot to cot
soothing the feverish patients and whis
pering words of encouragement to ail.
Even they were brought to tears at the
sad and pathetic scenes. They stood at
the bedsides of Girard and Newby and
closed the eyes of the lads when their
souls passed away, and reverently drew
white sheets over their crnelly disfigured
faces.
Up to a late hour the hospital register
showed the following:
long the boys' lives was to trephine their
skulls. They were placed on the table, but
after the operation Newby rapidly sank.
His father Frank Newby, heard of the
accident, and arrived at the hospital just
in time to see his boy before he died. The
mother had been sent for, but was not
in time to see her son alive.
McNeil was Identified by his uncle, who
happened in the hospital through the
merest chance. He thought the lad looked
like his nephew, and hurried for the boy s
mother. The poor woman was broken
hearted when she found her son uncon
scious. Mrs. McNeil had given Hector a
dollar with which to gain admission to
the game. The lad did not want to spend
the money, and took the opportunity of
witnessing the contest from the roof of
the building. The mother knelt at the side
of the- bed and kissed the lips of her boy
repeatedly, trying to woo him back to
consciousness, but the tender words fell
on deaf ears. Mrs. McNeil is only re
cently a widow, and her boy was her
only son. He died shortly after midnight.
A number of the injured went directly
to their residences and their Indentity
may never be made known to the public.
Among those who it is known wen?
treated at home are: riddle Holman, 847
Valencia street, serious contusion of head
and spine, and E. P. Tice of Alabama and

THRONGS ASSEMBLED AS THE DEAD WERE TAKEN FROM THE PLACE OF FIERY TORMENT.
DYING AND INJURED TAKEN FROM FACTORY'S BIG FURNACE AND RAFTERS
"The Fire Department rendered mater
ial aid In controlling the crowd and par
ticularly In removing the injured from
the roof. Both firemen and police vied
with each other In doing noble work."
When both wagons from the Morgue ar
rived, it took all the receivers they had
to carry oil the dead, a large number
of hats were picked up and taken charge
of by the Coroner's deputies. And for an
hour or more they were busy gathering
the names of witnesses and endeavoring
10 establish the Identity of the dead.
In less than an hour after the accident
the hospitals to which -the injured hal
been sent had all their spare beds filled.
The Receiving Hospital was taxed to It:
utmost capacity. Fifteen cases were
treated there, five of which were very
serlou*. Up to a late hour there were
mi deaths, those of Virgil Newby ano
]>>on Glrard. *
Brough, Dugpan and Garrenty are in a
very precarious condition, and the doc
tors hold out small hope of their recovery.
On the arrival of the wounded they were
made as comfortable as possible by Drs.
Bunnell. Starr. Williamson. McCarthy and
Buckley. One by one they were laid on
the operating table and given first aid.
After the wounds had been dressed the
doctors took in hand the more serious
cases, and they were operated upon.
The most pathetic cases treated were
those of NVwby and McNeil. Each boy
was about 16 years of age. After the ac
cident they were taken to the Railroad
Hoppital, where It Â»aÂ» found that both
had sustained fractured skulls. Later
they were taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal. Neither of the lads was conscious

IÂ«i-soniÂ« to identify them. The mo

"On the arrival of the ambulances and
patrol wagons those cases to which mÂ£3
fcal aid could be of value were immediate
ly removed to the nearest hospitals un
der my direction. While some of the in
jured were being removed, another corps
of police was engaged in segregating the
dead so as not to congest the hospitals
with the dead instead of the Injured. Si
rrsany were injured that it kept me figur
ing In my mind as to the number each
hospital could handle. Carriages of peo
ple who were attending the ball game
were freely offered by their owners to
remove the injured, and a gTeat many
were utilized for that purpose.
"I heard the crash, and accompanied by
David Wolfe, secretary of the City and
County Hospital.- who was with me ran
to the scene of the accident. I went up
stairs to where the large furnace is situ
ated and saw a terrible sight. The d<_ad
and injured were lying around the furnace
end some were on top of it. It resembled
& battle-field, and I hope never to see the
like of it again. I could not walk around
the furnace without stepping on the bod
ies of the dead and Injured. I sent Wolfe
to telephone to the Emergency Hospital
and then turned my attention to quieting
the crowd that had gathered. I got the
police, who acted in perfect accord with
me, to put all people out of the building
except the Injured. Then I turned my at
tention to helping the injured, in which I
was ably seconded by the police. We made
them comfortable as far as possible while
welting for the arrival of the ambulances
and patrol wagons. During this time 1
ordered water brought and the faces and
arms of the injured were sponged and the
blood washed from their faces.
While these were doing the best they

Phelan, James H. Davis, the superinten
dent and secretary of the glass company.
Issued the following signed statement:
"The great crowd of men and boys,
numbering several hundred, swarmed
over the eight-foot solid board fence, on
which are iwo strands of barbed wire,
making the total height ten feet. This
fence entirely surrounds the property of
the San Francisco and Pacific Glass
Works, excepting the part between
Woerner's cooperage and the glass work3.
which consists of a tight board fence
about twelve feet high. A part of the
crowd broke the fence down between
Wcerner's establishment and the gla?s
works and swarmed through the opening
made in the fence, and a part ciimbect
over the fence after getting on a pile of
lumber on the Woernvr premises, adjoin
ing the fence, enabling tbem to reach the
top of the enclosure.
"I made a determined effort, assisted by
a number of the employes of the glass
works, to prevent the crowd coming upon
the premises. But the crowd brusnert
aside .all opposition, and swarmed over
on the glass works property ana
climbed upon the buildings and occupied
every available space upon the top and
around the buildings. It Is safe to say
that not less than 500 and possibly as
many as 1000 people took possession of the
roofs of the various buildings on the
premises, and 300 or 400 people got upon
the roof of the ventilator of one of the
buildings, directly over the furnaces. Th!3
ventilator, owing to the tremendous
weight and pressure placed upon it, gave
way and precipitated a large number of
men and boys a distance of between forty
and fifty feet. Some of these people fell
on top of the hot furnace, and in the Im
mediate vicinity of the furnace, with th<
result that a number were killed and
many others Injured.
* The crowd endeavored also to force its
way through the doors of the buildinrr*.
but was driven back and the doora
barred. Some of the crowd dug beneath
the fence and crawled through holes made
under the fence In the ground. As socn
as the crowd began to force Its way into
the glass works premises the police were
telephoned for. The ventilator referred to
is about eight feet wide and 100 feet lon^r
and stood above the main building about
four feet, and was literally packed with
men and boys.
"The whole affair transpired in the
course of a few moments and everything
possible was done to prevent the people
from getting on the buildings or comlns?
on the grounds, but without avail. As a.
measure of precaution, men had been sta
tioned at the Various gateways and en

records of sea speeds. From the birth

go to France and the United States for ex

In electricity Â° we are mere humble imita

development in this all-pervading indus

true, making some feeble efforts to keep
up with our neighbors In' the^jreat com

in this practically unexplored field must
go to Nuremberg or to Pittsburg to find it.
We are still predominant in the cotton
industry, but it is simply a question of
time when this industry will forsake us
for its natural seatâ the Southern States

into a nation of brokers, depending for
our commercial existence on the capital

right? Not one in four, I'll bet! Now

"A great many guests make that kind
of chicken tracks on a page merely to be

a person of consequence."
. "But how' about â¢ fellows who can't
write?"- asked a guest,, who had listened
to the clerk's little homily; "don't they
sometimes make a scrawl for a bluff?"
"Yes, I've known that to be done," re
plied the clerk, smilingly; "but not often.
A man who can'twrlte finds it very diffi

such dust-producing agencies are at work.
And yet the records of sailing ships show
that they collect more sea dust than does
a Steamer, which is probably accounted
for by the fact that while the dust-laden
smoke blows clear of the steamer thi>
large area of canvas spread by the sailor
acts as a dust collector.
To quote an instance in support of this
contention we may mention that no lesa
than twenty-four and a halt barrels or
fine dust were swept from the decks of an
American Bailing ship during a ninety
seven days' voyage from New Tork tm
San Francisco. The captain of this ves
sel, a man of scientific tastes, made care

dust, but beyond the wear and tear of tlvj
sails and rigging, a quite negligible factor,
ho could assign absolutely no perceptible
cause for the formation of dust on boar i
his ship. It has been asserted that the
dust which falls on the decks of vessels
emanates from the Interstellar spaces.
This sounds both scientific and plausible,
but it is at variance with certain known
facts. Bits of leather, cork, wood ani

William Huergott of Hyde street said he heard a woman tutor these words immediately after the crash, but
who she Is- or to whom the questions were addressed he is. unable to state. The woman never finished her final
interrogation. Burly policemen rushed her and others aside, for an ambulance had dashed up and some men
were bringing the remains of a victim to the curb
Captain of Detectives Seymour had his best men at work last night investigating reports, evidently founded upon the
above incident, to the effect that an admission fee had been paid by those who gained 'access to the roof and who went
down with it in the crash.
Detectives Graham and Fitzgerald learned that Joseph Welch, residing at the corner of Twenty-third, and Bryant
streets, had reported to a friend that he had paid two bits to get a seat on the glass' wcrks roof. The detectives and a
Call reporter Interviewed Welch at his home.

Openshaw said further that he had offers of money varying from 10 to 50 cents if he would allow certain persons
admission to the roof, but he declined in every case. The only people whom he admitted at, the Fifteenth and Folsom
street entrance, where he was stationed, were a few mc.i and women who had permits from Manager Davis. . ,
William Meyers; bartender in the Boulevard saloon, says that during the rush at his place after the same he heard
several people say that they knew of persons who paid to get access to the roof, but he heard no names mentioned. '
The detectives visited all the hospitals and talked with those victims who were in a condition to be interviewed. All
cf ih*m. according to the detectives, denied having paid any money to any one for admission to the building.
George Murphy of 137 Erie street was reported to have paid money to get on the roof. A Call reporter talked with the
little fellow as he groaned and tossed on the bed at his home last night. ? 1
"Did I pay to get in? Yes. Iâ l gave de fellow 10 cents."
The boy tried hard to think when he was asked what the man to whom he paid the money looked like. He shut his
eyes as if to slÂ«ep, then opened them, and when asked a second time if he had paid any m'pney to see the game he an
swered that he had not. The boy received a bad contusion and other injuries, and.it will probably be some time yet be
fore he will be able to talk clearly of what actually took place. ,
Captain Seymour in speaking of the accident last evening said:
"We are doing everything in our power to try and fix the blame. Foreman Stillings of the glass works claims that
he notified headquarters before the accident happened that there was a crowd on the roof, but so far as I can learn no
message was received here. I was In the office all the afternoon, too. Stillings further claims that he was referred to
the Seventeenth-street station and the officer there, he says, referred him to Lieutenant Anderson on th grounds. They
tell me at the Seventeenth-street station that no such report reached them, nor was Lieutenant Anderson informed of
the conditions until after the accident occurred. .
"In regard to some of the unfortunates paying admission to the roof, we have Investigated ever}' story that has
come to us and feel pretty well convinced that no such rascality was indulged In. If it was, and If we get any evidence
to indicate that such was the case, we shall not hesitate to bring the offender to Justice. He' would deserve the severest
kind of punishment. It doesn"t seem to me. though, that a man could be fool enough to dare undertake such a scheme.
"The accident was a most shocking oneâ the worst fatality we have had since the burning of the Baldwin Hotel. It
ought to serve as a lesson for property owners to keep people off the roofs of their buildings during future celebrations."

OPINIONS OF COACHES.
i ~- - â . - i ,
Captain Pringle of. California: "I said before the game that
it would be a fight of system and tfce eleven that had the bet
ter system would win. I think our system gained the most
ground. Coach Keliy deserves a great deal of credit for put
ting such a good team into the field. He was handicapped in
having to take seven green men and teach them how to play
their positions. He had :6 change the players around contin
ually. He taught us the right kind of football. Their field goal
was an individual play. I do not care to iTscuss the men on
our team. Every 'man -played his best. I believe that Clay was
ruled out of the game unjustly, but I will not criticize the of
ficials. I think they were excellent."
. Captain Burnett of Stanford: "The game was the cleanest
I ever played in. Berkeley had a strong defense and we could
do nothing with their line. Our rivals, played the best game In
the flr>Â»t half, but we took a brace and outplayed them in the
last part of the game. California was very strong on the of
fensive. Their right tackle back gained a deal of ground for
them. Our boys played a hard game and deserved a victory.
My knee pained me considerably, but much to my surprise
lasted me until the whistle blew- the signal ending the game.
Raitt's lip was badly cut by. Gammon in the second half and
he had to leave the game. The officials were highly satisfac
tory and deserve praise for their just decisions."
THE toss of the coin brought luck
to Captain Burnett, who chose the
defense of the north goal. One
minute later the lithe body of
Johnny More swung the pedal pen
dulum 1 against the pigskin, and the ball
landed in the arms of Cooper. The Cali
fornia forwards were down the fleld fast
and sure, but an offside penalty for an in
fringement on the kick-off caused the ball
to be placed on the California fifty-yard
line for a second opening play. Again the
ball sailed upward and down among the
Stanford players. This time Erb nailed
it and, after a short run, in the opening
scrimmage, was set upon the Stanford
twenty-flve-yard line. The Stanford of
fense opened up in fairly effective style,
individual efforts of Erb and Slaker forc
ing the ball ten yards. Slaker ripped over
the left wing of Berkeley for four yards.
First doÂ«vn was added. The umpire penal
ized California for interference with the
center. Again the ball was slowly pushed
along, when, for Stanford's holding. Cali
fornia was awarded the precious pigskin
on the Stanford fifty-yard line. Gammon
slipped in the Initial California plunge at
the cardinal line and was stopped. A pen
alty gave the blue and gold five yards.
Then Smith of California, a halfback of
physique and desperate spirit, threw him
self across Burnett for five yards. Again
he attacked the same wing of the Stan
ford forwards, and on the twenty-five
y|rd line of the cardinal rested the ballâ
dirngerous near the defended goal. Gam
mon was stopped' again, but Captain Prin
gle hammered successfully at the enemy's
right wing, , and the ball _ rested on the
Stanford seventeen-yard line.

first attempt at a drop kick. The ball
landed In Raitt's arms on the 3-yard line.
To this point California had forced the
play against the goal of the cardinal.
Hill was signaled to punt the ball out of
danger. A tine low drive of about forty
yards and a subsequent roll, a Stanford

It fayed in execution, as did every trick

the wide-awakeness of the two sets of
ends. The two justly much-feared backs

The crowd was the greatest in the his
tory of California-Stanford football.
Every Beat in the grand stand and on the
bleachers was occupied. In the standing
room space at the west end of the grid
iron spectators were packed .in like ,sar
dines. Whichever way one turned, a mass
of people with blue and gold and cardinal
decorations struck the eye.
One other time the goal Stanford was
defending was in such acute danger that
hearts stopped beating in the Stanford
section. More had punted the ball down
the field over Rain's head, and It had
stopped rolling only two yards /rom the
goal line. When the teams lined up Hill
was called upon to punt. The pass was
bad. and Hill dropped the ball. California
men were charging at him, and. seemed
thick as bees about him, but he caught
the ball on the bound and punted out for
a short distance, preventing what might
easily have been a touchdown for Califor
nia. No punier ever escaped disaster
more narrowly.
In the second half the Stanford team
approximately struck the gait that It was
popularly supposed to possess. Slaker
and Seeley and Hill began to hit the line
for gains with clocklike regularity. Even
then, however, the team failed to show
consistent strength and was unable to
carry the ball along for a touchdown. Ex
cept for Traeger's beautiful place kick the
California men would now be celebrating
a tie game as a welcome half-victory and
Stanford men would be alternating be
tween chagrin at their failure to win and
satisfaction that after all they escaped
the defeat which eeemed early In the
game to be in store for them.
Three times California was in striking
distance, and that many times More was
allowed to try for a fleld goal, to fall in
each attempt. In one of them the ball
sailed so near a goal post that the blue
and gold contingent thought the attempt
had been successful.
superiority. For most of , the first half the
glory was all the blue and gold's. from
the very first the California men hammer

on the defenslve'were able to stop up their
opponents. Twice a touchdown for Cali
fornia seemed certain, the ball being but
eight yards from the goal line on first
down. But the Stanford line held at the
critical moment in the one instance and
took the ball on downs. The other time
AVomble, California's field captain, chose
to let Johnny More try for a field goal
by a drop kick rather than to take the
risk of sending Gammon or Smith straight
into the opposing line, though only two
and a half yards had to be gained. More
failed in his try, and many California
men blame Womble's generalship In that
instance and say that it lost them the

straight plunge. Then came a Stanford
braceâ the fine effective stopping of three
assaults, an* -for the first time the car
dinal held on downs, won the ball anl
took her Inning* of offense again.
Seeley made It first, but poor offense
soon forced Stanford to punt. The ball
landed In mldfield. The run In was short,
as were all during the entire game.
Then Gammon again showed his ability.
Helped by thÂ« forwards he forced Stan
ford's left wing for three yards. Smith,
made it three nwe straight over the cen
ter. Gammon followed for four yards and
Duden was used as a relief. Smith and
Prlngle jumped straight through the cen
ter and the ball was down to Stanford's
30-yard line, but here it changed color on
downs.
Then came the guard's back formation
of Stanford and Seeley landed the- ball
five yards further for. a first down. A
half fumble caused Stanford to essay a
punt. Hill was good for a drive to tha
California 50-yard line. A foul caused the
ball to move ten yards toward Stanford's
goal. Gammon was driven straight ahead
for three yards and Smith went over Lea
for -two yards and -the first down. Cali
fornia's men seemed spent In force under
the desperate offensive wont. Captain
Prlngle being laid out at intervals and a
lineman or so being winded at time-*.
Although he played the best defensive
game of the five middle, forwards Traeger
was skirted now and then.
At this point Gammon whipped pa3t
him for four yards and was over De For
rest and Lee for one yard more and the
first down. In the form of one and two
years ago Smith and Prlngle made it a
first down to Stanford's thirty-yard line.
Again Gammon was sent, straight over
the center for three and two yards and
the necessary distance. Short plunges
brought the ball to Stanford's twenty
yard line, under the shadow of the car
dinal goal posts. Here Gammon was
stopped by "Babe" Burnett, who seemed
to have the latent power up his sleeve to
rally on the defense when it was most
needed. Here came th* spectacular in
play. After Seeley and Burnett had been
worked for the first down by Duden and
Gammon. Smith was sent on a cross
buck and was stopped short. Gammon
was dropped In hia tracks by Billy Erb
and the boys of the cardinal won the ball
on" pure fighting force on the six-yard â¢
line.
Back went Hill for a kick. One minute
later a California double pass in midfleld
failed, and Morse's good right foot punted
the ball to the Staniord eight-yard line Into
"Stub" Raltt's arms. A fake play of a,
delayed pass failed on slow advances, and
on a disastrous fumble California won the
ball within easy striking distance of the
enemy's goal. Here More's try at a drop
kick failed. Stanford kicked out from the
twenty-flve-yard line and California a mo
ment later returned the punt. Raitt ran
It into midfleld. and here the timekeeper's
whistle sounded the end of the, first half,
the score standing 0 to 0. and most of the
play having been forced Into Stanford's
territory, with California showing the
most effective ball-advancing- ability.

5A DEMAND POR FILIPINOS.
The three noblemen are among the highest and the
richest of the British nobility. They own large estates,
have hereditary duties to perform and many social
obligations; yet to serve their city they are willing
to undertake the burden and worry of municipal office.
Not one of them will ever be a brilliant Mayor, but
each will be a stimulus to the ablest citizens to take
part in municipal administration; and, consequently.
London will have the best government that her
-.vealth. her brains, her energy and her virtue can give
her. If trie better classes of the city of New York
honestly desire a better government than Tammany
gives they must follow the example set them by the
nobles of England. So long as business men neglect
public service and city politics is regarded as lacking
in dignity, so long will municipal affairs be badly
administered. The best charter in the world will
never make a first-class government- out of second
rate men.
So the city election in London was presented to the
people, not Â£s a struggle for municipal offices, but as
a patriotic duty, as a part of "imperial politics," and
as such they dealt with it. The London Chronicle in
reviewing the elections of Aldermen and Mayors for
the twenty-eight Town Councils into which the city
government is now divided notes that in every in
stance they are men of the highest character, all of
them holding eminent positions in business,- in pro
fessional life, in politics and in society. Most of them
are of local note only and a citation of their names
Â¦would not be of significance here, but it may be noted
that among the new Mayors are the Duke of Nor
folk, Mayor of Westminster; the Duke of Bedford,
Mayor of Holborn, and Earl Cadogan, Mayor of
In inaugurating their^ new municipal government
the people of London have relied more upon men
than upon the new charter. They have sought to
Lrinp into the service of the city the ablest men, not
only in the city itself but in the empire. Just before
the election the Bishop of London and the clergy of
the diocese in a formal and solemn letter urged all
classes of citizens to serve the city patriotically and to
accept any office to which the}' might be called; and
Lord Rosebery in a public address said: "The empire
i> not South Africa alone, or Canada alone, or Aus
tralia alone, or India alone. The heart of the empire
is Britain, and the heart of Britain is London, and you
cannot afford to let that source and center of empire
decay or be poisoned for the want of vigilance and
supervision on your part. In another sense even more
vital this is an imperial question. What is an empire
unless it is pillared on an imperial race? And what
are you doing if you allow this imperial race to be
vitiated and poisoned in the dens of crime and horror
in which too many of them are reared at this mo
ment?"
1 he lesson is the ole ot:e that Rood government de
pends more upon good officials than upon constitu
tions or charters. . At the very foundation of our re
public Benjamin Franklin enunciated that truth in
his opposition to any requirement for official oaths,
upon the ground that good mea did not need to take
oaths and bad men would not obey them if taken.
American cities have frequent reform movements
that sweep vice from the tenderloins for a time,
but speedily lose their force and permit the old evil
to flourish again. Reform fails because one set of
politicians is substituted by another set; and while the
one may represent a different political party from tlje
other, the bosses that control them are very apt to
be partners, so that the ""business" of profiting by the
spoils that can be extorted from vice is not long in
terrupted. *
BISHOP POTTER of New York and his asso
ciates, who are now striving to bring abcut
tuch a reform in municipal politics as will
separate the city government irom the city. vices and
break up that combination of "pay and protection"
which makes the police force itself a patron and a
partner in crime, can find a useful lesson for them
in the newly established city government in London.
It is a lesson of value, moreover, to other cities than
Xe* York, and merhs the attention of all thoughtful
Americans.
A LESSON FROM LONDON.
That sort of thing is not to be dismissed contempt
uously.' -It undoubtedly represents an Eastern senti
ment of considerable strength. It is, however,
founded ori igno'rance and can be overcome by plain
statements of the truth. It has been estimated by
competent . engineers that . there are upward of
7S,ooo,ooo acres of land in the Union that can be re
deemed by irrigation at a cost of about $140,000,000,
or less/than $2 an acre. The land thus redeemed will
yield five times as much as any of those Maryland
acres which the American says can be had so cheaply.
The lands, moreover, would not be productive of
centipeds and tarantulas any more than the- Maryland
fields produce the pluguglies of Baltimore. Such
facts must be made known, for until we have con
verted ignorance of the East into a clear understand
ing of the enterprise it is not likely to be undertaken
by Congress.
The millions that the. Government will be asked to
spend. on this and other , Irrigation schemes will be for
the benefit of enterprising .wtiite men, who, i? they.thlnk
there Is pressing need of such works, should Invest their
own money in tho project. Even 1 If these works. were
built. It is doubtful If they would pay the Interest on.tha
Investment Tho waters of these streams are limited,
and extremely so Is the area which could by any possi
bility be irrigated. One would think from tho repre
sentations of this congress that all the arable land In
the country was used up, and it was. necessary for tho
Government to come forward and rescue the people
from starvation. Thero are hundreds of thousarfls of
acre3 in Maryland to-day' which do not need any irriga
tion, and which may be bought for one-half the price
per aero that the speculators demand for theso arid
alkali deserts In the Southwest; Settlers have here
churches, echools, society and good order, while out
thero they have the burning sands of the desert and a
politic convocation of tarantulas, centipeds, rattle
snakes an'd jrfla monsters.
To overcome that opposition and win over the in
different to'an earnest support of the plan a consider
able campaign of education is still necessary. 'As an
illustration of the nature of the antagonism we liave
tc meet it may be noted that the. Baltimore American
recenfly described irrigation in Arizona as "a scheme
worth watching," ana stated, "It is hinted the Na
tional Irrigation Congress will endeavor to make a
raid on Congress," and then went on to say:
WHflT WE hflVE. TO FIGHT.
WHILE most of the Eastern papers have noted
the proceedings of the recent irrigation r con
gress^ at Chicago with. fairness, very few have
wsrmly indorsed_the plan for undertaking irrigation
at once, and some\have strongly antagonized it.. In
that section of the Union, therefore, the enterprise
will be received' with a good deal of indifference, n
little cordial support and much in the way of active,
opposition. , .'-Â¦Â¦Â¦ ;

It is to be noted that the-e is on the British side in
South Africa a greater man than either Kitchener or
Roberts; and that man is Cecil Rhodes, the author
of the war. He has declared himself emphatically
for a policy of conciliation at any and every cost. In
a recent speech before ihe South African League at
Cape Town he said: "If I could say a word to the
Dutch, I would say, 'For goodness sake, drop this
business about the late war and its bitterness. The
whole country is one, and what a work we have be
fore us.' " Thus he purposes to appeal to the self
interests of the patriots to pet to work, to develop
their country and to make it rich, promising equal
rights and privileges to all. If that policy be adopted
and Kitchener's harsh methods set aside there may
yet be a solution of the problem that will not stagger
civilization, but it must be admitted that at this time
the prospects are far from cheering.
DOWN in South Africa there is going on one
of "those great world tragedies whose problems
have never yet been solved to the satisfaction of
humanity. On the one side is the force of a great
empire tending to progress and the advancement of
civilization, and on the other a free people opposed
to progress and to change, holding fast to the ways
of their fathers and resolved to die rather than sur
render that freedom. The human intellect approves
the cause of the empire, but the heart sympathizes
with the indomitable patriots. Between the two there
is no longer organized war; there is only the struggle
{ of military power against the strength of an armed
and desperate people. Civilization stands half af
frighted at the task imposed upon her, and even in
Great Britain itself earnest and noble minds are doubt
ing whether anything victory can give will repay the
appalling cost required to achieve it.
In his recent speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet,
Salisbury indicated a clear conception of the diffi
culties, that confront him in dealing with the prob-
I lem, and his only word of goo'd cheer on the subject
; was the expression of a hope that ere long repre
sentatives of the burghers of the Transvaal and of the
Orange Free State may have seats "in the Imperial
Parliament and the conquered provinces be recon
ciled to become parts of the "empire as self-govern
ing states.
The expression "of such a hope indicates on the
part of the British Premier an intention, or at least a
desire, to pursue in South Africa a policy of concilia
tion. It suggests, however, nothing definite in the
way of immediate policy, nor intimates how concilia
tion can be effected with men resolved to die rather
than accept conciliation upon any other terms than
those of absolute independence.
The situation so far from clearing up after the dis
pcrsion of the Boer armies has grown darker. It is
now evident that Kruger's retirement from South
Africa was not a flight, but a movement for protract
ing the war by appealing to the sympathies of Europe
and to the interests of the nations on the side of the
patriots. So far as the representatives of the Boers
have spoken at all their voices have been anything
but weak or timid. Thus Kruger himself said at Mar
seilles I "I have fought with savages, but the present
war is even worse. We will never surrender. We ar;
determined to fight to the last extremity, and if the
republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State
lose their independence it will be because they have
lost every man, woman and child."
Olive Schreiner, speaking to a woman's convention
at Cape Town, said recently: "I know not how it is
with you; but for me, though I' should live to be a
very old woman, never again while I live shall I hear
the name of England spoken or see it written but I
shall hear a whisper, 'The oppressor.'" And again
she said: "I know the day will come when hands
will rise which will in actuality unfurl the republi
can flags and they will float free across South Africa.
We may not live to see it; many of us may go down
in tears and sorrow and blood to our graves; but the
future is with the republicans."
Of course, too much importance ritast not be at
tached to words like these. The fierce cry for
vengeance on the part of the conquered has been
heard after every great war. It came from the South
immediately after our Civil t War, and it was heard
for many a year from France after the war with Ger
many. Time has cured those passions. Southern
men in the war against Spain fought as valiantly as
those from the North under the flag of the nation;
and in France to-day the cry for "revanche" has given
way to talk of an alliance with Germany against
Great Britain. The men and women of South Africa
whose voices now sound like the roar heard from a
"Numidian desert, with all her lions up," may grow
calmer with' the years;
THE. SOUTH AFRICAN TRAGEDY.
set forth by Mr. Carlisle, it is not altogether accurate.
Bryanism is an outcome of Populism, and Populism
did not start in the South, though the Southern
Democrats after fighting it in their own States allied
themselves with it in, the West for the purpose of de
feating the Republicans. That element of disconteni
which has made Bryanism so formidable a force can
not be allayed by Southern conservatives. The
Southerners betrayed -the Democratic organization to
Bryan, but it is by no means. certain that- they can take
it away. Despite all that Carlisle and others of his po
litical faith may hope, the chances are that when next
the parties of the country align themselves in a strug
gle for the Presidency,"the conservatives of the South
will have to unite themselves with the Republican
party and leave their old organization in the hands to
which they surrendered it in 1896.
NEW JAPANESE CABINET
ABREAST OF THE TIMES
seemed to meet pretty general approval,
including that of Count Okuma, leader of
the opposition. Baron Kaneko has held
official positions beforeâ as Vice Minister
and also Minister of Agriculture and Com
merce. He also took a prominent part in
assisting Marquis Ito In the compilation
of .the Imperial constitution, and has
served as secretary of either the Cabinet
or one of the houses of the Diet, I cannot
now recall which. He Is an alumnus of
Harvard, "an erudite Jurisconsult," who
last year received the degree of LL.D.
from his American alma mater.
Count Okuma and people in general also
approve most heartily the appointment of
Mr. Kato to the foreign office. Mr. Kato
speaks English perfectly and has had Inti
mate experience of foreign affairs for
many years. During his tenure of of
fice as Japanese representative in London
he acquitted himself in such a way as to
acquire exceptional popularity among
Englishmen, while at the same time sen
sibly promoting his country's Interests.
Baron Suyematsu is Marquis Ito's son
in-law and served as Minister of Commu
nications In the Ito Cabinet of 1S98. He
was once a member of the Nlchi-NIchi
Shimbun's staff, and afterward received
his first official appointment as an em
ploye of the Cabinet in October. 1S75. In
January, 1S7S, he undertook a series of
investigations into English and French
historical compilations, and was then
transferred to the foreign office as third
class secretary and appointed to the le
gation In London, but he soon resigned
that post for the purpose of studying- at
Cambridge University, where he obtained
the degrees of bachelor of law and bach
elor of arts. Returning to Japan in lSSfi
he became chief of the legislative bureau.
For distinguished service during the war
with China, he was raised to the nobility
with the patent of baron. lie resigned
his official position In 1S93 and entered the
lower house, where ho showed consider
able ability as a debater.
The comments of the vernacular press
are, on the whole, favorable to the new
Cabinet. One paper calls It a "bundle of
rags" and disapproves the whole slate.
Now this paper objects to Viscount Wat
anabe, and is "Inclined to think that
round men have been put into square
holes." But the other papers are glad to
have new blood Infused into administra
tive life.
The outcome of this experiment In Ja
panese politics will be watched with the
keenest interest. It is almost useless to
make any forecasts, however, because In
the Orient "the unexpected always hap
pens." and some little thing may suddenly
upset all one's calculations.

WAS WITHOUT DEBTâ S.. City. There
was a time In the history of the Union
when the States were practically out of
debt. On January 1, 1791. the bonded debt
of the United States was $73,453,477. Dur
ing the following seventeen years the
debt fluctuated slightly about the eighty
million point, then dropped down to $45 -
209,738 in 1812. The war with England sent
it up to $127,000,000 in 1S17. This was rapid
ly liquidated and In 1836. for the first time
in the history of the country, there was
practically no debt. The Secretary of the
Treasury in his report to Congress under
date of December 8, 1S35, gave the amount
of the public debt outstanding 1 as $328 3SÂ°
and that remained unpaid solely because
the payment was not demanded, ampie
funds to meet all obligations having been
deposited in the United States bank and
with the commissioner of loans.

FTVB OJ* THE MEMBERS OF MARQUIS ITO'S NEW CABINET, WHO
HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF YOUNG BLOOD AND DECIDEDLY
LIBERAL IDEAS.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of
this Cabinet is the fact that Marquis Ito
Is the only representative of the so-called
olf er statesmen and that all the portfolios
are held by comparatively young men. It
was expected by many that there would
be at least one more representative of the
older statesmen In the person of Marqui3
Ito's old. and intimate friend. Count In
ouye. - His financial ability is universally
recognized to be of the highest order and
he possesses the complete confidence of
business circles.
Of the youngr men Mr. Matsuda and Mr.
Havashi have been very prominent in
both the Liberal party and the House of
Representatives. They were both mem
bers of that short-lived "popular Cabi
net" organized in 1898 by Counts Okuma
and Itugakl. At that time j*i.r. Matsuda
was Minister of Finance and Mr. Haya
shi was Minister of Communications.
What qualifications the' latter has for
Mlniste* of Aerlculturo and Commerce
have not been stated. Concerning Mr.
Matsuda as Minister of Education the
Japan Times says: "A roan of modern
education and strictly pure in morals, h?
Is particularly well fitted to preside over
the department to which he has been ap
pointed." It is certainly to be hoped that
he will adopt a liberal policy toward
Christian schools.
The appointment of Baron Kaneko
Of the seven new Ministers who are to
serve under Marquis Ito five were active
leaders of the Liberal party, which re
cently dissolved and now forms the prin
cipal part of the , Constitutional Political
Association. But the other two, Baron
Kaneko and Mr. Kato, are non-partisan.
THE new Jaoanese Cabinet, the
fourth that Marquis Ito has formed
since the Introduction of the Cab
inet system, will have no light task
ahead of it In the settlement of the
Chinese question. To the task, however,
it brings much new blood and Is chock
full of advanced Ideas. It is composed as
follows: .Minister President, Marq.uis Ito;
Minister of Finance, Vlacount Watanabo;
Minister of Home Affairs, Baron Suyera
atsu; Minister of Justice, Baron Kaneko;
Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.
Mr. Hayashl; Minister of Education. Mr.
Matsuda; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.
Kato; Minister of Communications, Mr.

The Supervisors are again making a serious effort

Some surprise has. been caused by' the fact that an
insane man attempted to prevent a police raid on on
of-the Chinese -gambling dens. Perhaps the unusual
and rare character of the performance upset the poor
fellow's mind.
The American millionaire who has decided to pay
the debts of his; son-in-law, the Duke of, Manchester

It is said' that th,e national Democracy hat decided
not to; reorganize. : Friends' of the'old lady have prob'.
ably made desperate efforts to find her shattered frag
ments and have failed. ' . .
' n; X-SECRETARY CARLISLE has just made
his contribution toward the, subject of Demo-
* â * cratic reorganization and reform. He has
"nothing to say.a^ to the form the reorganization
should take, or as to the new policies that should be
adopted, but much concerning the source from which
the reform movement should come and the methods
by which it should proceed. â¢
His argument is that the Democrats of the South
ern States are more responsible for Bryanism than
nny other class of people; that so long as he holds
control of the Democratic machine in the South, so
long will Bryan dominate the party in the nation;
a"nd, consequently, no njatter where the reform move
ment be initiated or what particular course it take, its
support must come mainly from . the South. He
points out that of the 155 electoral votes secured at
the recent election for the candidate nominated by the
three allied political parties, only thirteen were
chosen outside of the Southern States, and these thir
teen were chosen in only four States by popular ma
jorities aggregating less than 50,000.
Mr. Cat nsle notes further that, in thus allying itself
with the four mining Statesâ Colorado, Idaho, Mon
tana arid Nevada â upon free silver and other Populist
policies, the South has engaged in unnatural politics,
inasmuch as it has voted against its own interests,
.which are the same as those of the great industrial
and commercial States. The course thus pursued is
doubly injurious to the South, for it not only interferes
with the material advancement of the Southern people
but gives them false political ideals and weakens their
influence in the. nation.
As to the reform movement itself Mr. Carlisle said:
"I do not think it makes much difference wire re it
originates, provided it is made in good faith and on
the proper basis. What I mean to say is, that if the
Democrats of the South will inaugurate the move
ment, or will' join their real friends and natural politi
cal allies, in an effort to unite their forces on a sound
and conservative basis, the breach in the party will
'be closed at once, and the recent unfortunate episode
in its history will be, remembered oniyas a warning
against future attempts to revolutionize the organiza
tion by coalitions xvith the advocates of undemocratic
doctrines."

SCUTHERN RESPONSIBILITY.
WERE our universities treated as commercial
bodies and their activities reported in ' the
language of trade it would be announced just
now that there is a large demand all over the country
for Filipino students, and that, while the bigger uni
versities are suspected of trying to corner the mar
ket, there is no reason to doubt that the more en
terprising of the smaller institutions will' be able to
get their orders filled, provided they apply early. t
Such language would in no way exaggerate the
situation. In fact, our Eastern reports lead us to be
lieve that, while the demand for American students
continues firm and the offerings are from fair to mid
dling, with premiums for football players, there 13
something like a boom in the importation of Filipino
students.
It appears that no university in the East regards
itself as a real live institution unless it has at least
the prospect of several Filipino students on its rolls.
Nor is the demand confined to universities. Other
cducational institutions are in the market and are
eager bidders. Thus we learn that as soon as Yale
had made a bid of free tuition to "selected Filipinos,"
two normal schools in Minnesota immediately made
a bid for four each of the same quality on the same
ttrms.
Our Pacific Coast universities being on th- western
shore line of the continent have, of course, first chance
and choice in selecting Filipinos, unless shipped by
way of Europe. We could, therefore, command a
grade a little better, at least, than even that which at
Yale has been graded as "selected." It is to be hoped,
however, our university authorities will not attempt a
corner on the market. Every Eastern university, col
lege or normal school desiring a Filipino should be
permitted to have one. Our universities should, go
forward in the work of educating our own young men
and women. There is no use wasting money in specu
lating in selected Filipinos in a crowded and over-

HONOLULU. Nov. 21.â The Republican
of to-day says: Within thirty days suits
will be filed on behalf of the United States
to set aside all grants, sales and leases of
public lands made by the Territorial Gov
ernment of Hawaii since the 14th day of
June, 1900. The Republican is in position
to state this as an absolute fact, despite
the statement sent out from Washington
to the effect that the Department of J us
tlce denied that Attorney General John
W Griggs had Instructed District Attor
ney Baird to institute suits to set aside
all grants, sales, franchises and leases in
Hawaii granted since September 2s, lSttf.
First Circuit Judge Humphreys this
morning made an order from the bench
excluding reporters for the Honolulu Re
publican and the Advertiser from In front
of the railing in his court. The immediate
cause of the order in the case of the Re
publican was the publication of matter
which the Judge held should not have
been published in connection with the
Miner divorce case. In the case of the
Advertiser the cause was that paper's
comments upon his action in trying to
have the Republican editor brought before
him for contempt.
The result of the Judge's instructions to
the Attorney General to proceed against
the Republican was a reply to the effect
that thatpaper had acted within Its legal
rights. The Advertiser denounced the
whole proceeding as an advertising
scheme for the Republican, in which the
Judge is said to be a heavy stockholder.
Judge Humphreys' action' created a sen
sation, the last of a long series he has
created since he took his judgeshlp. He
declared that the reporters were only al
lowed within the rail as a privilege and
that the men from the two papers men
tioned had abused the privilege. His bail
iff has a standing order to keep them out.

RIO JANEIRO, Brazil, Nov. 29.-A dis
patch from Manaos. Brazil, announces
that a volunteer corps is being organized
there to support the so-called republic of
Acre apainst the Bolivian troops. In view
of the assertion made by the Bolivian
Minister that the authorities of the State
of Amazonas are- giving active assistance
to the rebels, this announcement is re
garded as significant. Should the expedi
tion be permitted to take the field Bolivia
would probably make an emphatic pro
test. .
It Is reported here that the Bolivian
Ministers in Washington and London are
negotiating for the sale of Bolivia's rights
in Acre to an American syndicate. It Is
believed, however, that the rumor has
been circulated by representatives of Acre
for the object of discrediting Bolivia.

"He appeared thin and emaciated, and
his voice had a hollow ring. He was verv

CASTLE ROCK, Wash., Nov. 29.â A
double murder took place about two and
a half miles west of ihls place last night.
The victims were Cornelius Knapp and
his wife. No trace has yet been found of
the- murderer. The rrime was most de
liberate and diabolical and the motive 1Â«
supposed to have been lobbery. Mr. and
Mrs. Knapp were sitting at their evening
meal when suddenly a shot rang out ami
Mrs. Knapp received the greater part of
a charge of buckshot Ilrod through the
window at close range, killing her in
stantly. A stray shot also struck Mr.
Knapp, severing the carotid artery. He
was bleeding profusely, but was able to
make his way into an' adjoining room and
open the door. As he aid eo the murderer
finished his work by emptying the con
tents of the other barrel of the gun into
the unfortunate man's breast and he died
Instantly.
The murder was evidently premeditated,
because the assassin chose his position so
that his two victims were in direct line
of fire at the first shot. From the appear
ance of the-.house it is ascertained that
the murderer also made a complete search
of the premises. With what result Is not
at present known; The only theory ad
vanced as a motive is that Mr. Knapp
was a few days ago trying to negotiate a
large loan. The party or parties to the
crime thought that he had been success
ful and took this means of securing the
monev.
Mr. Knapp and his wife were well
known here. They were pioneers of the
place and had lived at the homestead
where they met their death for over
eighteen years. The authorities are mak
ing every effort to locate the assassin.

Father McKinnon says In part, under
date of Ban Francisco, October 15, 1900:
"You ask me what would be the future of
the church there, provided there were a
change in the administration. In answer-
Ing this I do not think that I can do bet
ter than quote for you words of. ths Arch
bishop of Manila. I asked him what he
thought would be 'the effect on religion
if the Americans were to withdraw, and
he threw up his hands and said he dread
ed even to contemplate such a catastrophe
and believed the only hope for religion
in the archipelago was for America to re
tain possession there. I might add that
more than once I heard Archbishop Cha
pelle, the apostolic delegate, express the
same opinion: In fact, any one who Is at
all familiar with the history of the insur
rection cannot, in my estimation, hold any
other opinion.
"Fully three-fourths of the entire' popu.
latlon of the archipelago would consider
it the greatest misfortune that could hap
pen to them if we were to withdraw and
leave them to the mercy of Aguinaldo and
his followers. I perhaps know this people
better and have their confidence to a
greater extent than any one who ever
visited the archipelago. In my position
as Superintendent of Public Instruction
and in other offices I have filled. I was
brought into very close touch with them."
Â¦ In Manila Father McKinnon filled sev
eral oflices. He had rare opportunities
to learn the real sentiment of the natives,
and declares that the vast majority favor
the Americans and are opposed to the in
surgents, whom he denounces for their
Inhuman treatment of priests and nuns.

reloaded his revolver, and then came on
up town. On his way he was met by Con

shook him and asked him for the money.
Shine in Borne way slipped to the floor and
Nason slapped him lightly on the face and
told him to get out of the house. Shine

about three or four minutes. He got as
far as the end of the bar when he was
met by Nason. Nason said. "I want you to
get out of here and stay out." and Shine
replied. "All right, I will go." There was
no scuffle and no loud language. Nason
escorted Shine to the front door of the
office and then gave him a shove toward
the door. With this Shine turned with
the words, "I'll shoot you," and shot Xa
son twice in the abdomen.

hadn't much faith In the possibility of a' cure

up for months, but from the day I began the
Rice method the rupture did not bother me
for a minute. It was only a short time when
I couldn't feel any trace of where the rupture
had been and I soon was able to work all day
as freely as a young man. I advise every rup-
tured man or woman to send at once and ret
this method as It will certainly cure permanent-
ly and perfectly." Mr. Meyer's advice Is good
Upon application to Dr. Rice, he will send you
free a. trial of his famous method, and If you
know of any other person ruptured have him

will be admitted to the building at 10
o'clock. At 3 o'clock the military escort
will accompany the remains back to the
house, where they will lie until 11 o'clock
Saturday morning, when the funeral ser
vices will take place. These will be pure

will be contributed by the official reports

boats over the Fashoda affair. They say
the natives were greatly alarmed."

cling to the rigging for hours, finally,
drifting ashore on parts of the ship.

of a desire to hasten a settlement to the
satisfaction of Hhe United States. An

a subterfuge designed for local consump

Nevertheless, it is now believed that

DESIRE TO PAY
.When bidden to the wedding of David
Adams and Miss O'Connor at the neigh
boring town of New Westminster some of
the younger guests concluded that the ex
plosion of a few dynamite bombs as the
bridal party started off on their tour
would properly express the general joy
of the whole company. The bombs were
secreted under the residence of Arthur
O'Connor, where the ceremony was held.
Just as Rev. Thomas Scoular, the officiat
ing minister, said, "Wilt thou take this
man â " the dynamite prematurely ex
ploded with a terrific report. The bride
screamed, another woman fainted and
there was a general p*anic.
The house was instantly filled with
dense smoke. Some straw under the house
caught fire from the bombs and the fire
department quickly responded to. an
alarm. Not knowing the cause of so much
smoke the Hremen turned on the hose and
soon the wedding decorations were a sad
sight. Despite these depressing incidents
the bride was flnally\ led back to the par
lor, where the clergyman finished the
ceremqny. Mr. and Mrs. Adams had no
cause to complain of the lack of warmth
of their friends.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Nov. 29.â The de
sire to celebrate a wedding with proper
enthusiasm was responsible for a mishap
which broke up the marriage ceremony
just as the clergyman had reached the
vital part of the service, frightened all "the
guests half to* death and almost burned
down the house.

TERRIFIC SHOCK
AT A WEDDING
TULARE, Nov. 29.â This was the great
day at the Citrus Fair. Early in the
morning visitors commenced to arrive,
and by noon the city was more crowded
than it has been for many years. The
Fresno special train arriving at 10 a. m.
with about 1000 people and visitors from
Bakersfield. Hanford and Vlsalia helped
increase the number. The pavilion was
crowded both afternoon and evening, and
every one seemed to appreciate the effort
that has been made to make this the
greatest citrus display that has been
seen in the San Joaquln Valley.
People begin to appreciate tne fact that
oranges ana lemons can be grown in this
district, and can be placed in the Eastern
markets long before the other citrus dis
tricts can compete with them. It would
be difficult to give an impression of the
beautiful appearance made by the ex
hibit of different fruits fh the main build
ing; it would have to be seen to be fully
appreciated. The tables with their banks
ot oranges, lemons and limes and all
other citrus varieties and the contrast
of the green of palms and olives make
a beautitul scene.
The usual excellent musical programme
was rendered both afternoon and evening.
During the evening Miss Stella Wakeneid
sang two solos. By the request of a
great many people from the surrounding
country who who have been unable to
attend during the week the time of the
closing of the fair will be extended to
Sunday night at 10 o'clock.
One of the features connected with the
fair this afternoon was the football game
at the racetrack between the Fresno and
lula re high schools. Fully 5000 people
were present. It was Tulare's day for
while the Fresno boys tried hard to win
and played an excellent game they were
beaten by a score of 23 to o. During the
evening, in connection with the fair a
danco was given in Library Hall, which
was largely attended. The music was fur
nished by the Fresno orchestra.

Admiral Remey's reference to the Jus
tin, which went to the rescue of the Yo
semite. applies to the collier Justin,
which recently had arrived at Guam. The
plans concerning the Yosemlte were in a
transient state, and within a! few days
from the time of her loss she was .ex
pected to leave Guam for Cavite. At the
same time the collier Brutus had been or
dered from the Philippines to Guam,
where she was to take the place of the
Yosemite as a station ship. In the ab
sence of all cable connection with Guam
it is impossible for the department to
know whether or not the Brutus had
reached there at the time of the disas
ter. The Brutus took on a crew and ma
rines, who will act as the garrison at
Guam, replacing the forces which have
been there for about a year.
The General Alava, w"hich is reported
fmm Manila to have passed Into the
track of the same typhoon which over
whelmed the Yosemite, is a little gunboat
of 532 tons displacement. Nevertheless
she is said to have been perfectly stanch
and seaworthy, and. providing she met
the storm in the open sea. she would in
Â«11 probability have come safely through.
The Alava was a Spanish gunboat cap
tured by the United States army In the
Philippines, where she had been used by
the insurgents, and was turned over to
the United States navy about a year ago
Admiral Remey's dispatch came â¢ early
and gave the tirst official data of the total
loss of the Yosemlte. The dispatch was
communicated to Secretary' Long, who
came to the department ajid spent part
of the morning there. Tl^s Secretary ex
pressed profound regret at the loss of
the ship and men. but said there was some
consolation In the fact that the loss of
life was comparatively small, considering
the large complement of officers and men
carried by the Yosemite under ordinary
circumstances. A dispatch was sent to
Admiral Remey asking for all further
particulars which might be available, and
for the names of the lost boat's crew.
The fact that Admiral Kempff had left
Cavite by this time for Guam gÂ«ve as
surance that everything possible would be
done. The. Secretary said the department
would make every effort to ascertain the
extent of the disaster and the names of
those lost, and would keep tho public in
formed.

LIVERPOOL. Nov. 29.â The Lord Mayor
entertained another .contingent of home
ward bound Canadian troops to-day at
the town hall here. A dramatic fea
ture of the entertainment was a speech by
Private Mollery. who had been rendered
sightless by a bullet which traversed his
temples. Mollery, who was supported by
a comrade on each side, related how he
left his university to serve the empire.
He said he had no regret for so doing, as
the "truly brave should be ready to accept
the vicissitudes of fortune with fortitude."
The Canadians will proceed to WlnÂ«^or
to-morrow morning, and will there be re
ceived by the Queen.
General Trotter followed In a similar
strain. He also read a letter from the
Duke of Connaught eulogizing the. work
of the Canadians. The contingent consists
of companies A, B and j I. .
The composite regiment of the House
hold Cavalry also returned on the Ha
warden Castle. The troops' arrival In
London was marked by the scenes of en
thusiasm which have so often been re
hearsed In the metropolis during the past
year. Great crowds awaited the. cavalry
men, and the cheering was lusty and long
throughout their march to their quarters.
Paddington, where they detrained, was
ablaze with colors, as were the streets
along the route. Several regimental bands
added to the general gayety, and the
throngs sang "God Save the Queen."
A portion of the Household Cavalry de
tachment proceeded to Windsor, where
they were received at the railroad station
by the Mayor and corporation. Cheering
thousands lined the beflagged route to the
castle, where the home-coming warriors
marched past the Queen and members of
the royal family..
The reception of the Canadians In Lon
non'was most enthusiastic. Large crowds
at the railroad station cheered and re
cheered them, and the whole route from
the station to the barracks was lined with
similarly cordial throngs. Flags, includ
ing many Canadian emblems, were dis
played everywhere.
The men marched In splendid order, and
appeared to be in perfect condition. When
they were drawn up in the barracks the
Duke of Abercorn, chairman of the re
ception committee, congratulated the
Canadians on their achievements.
General Stewart' made a brief speech to
the Canadians, during the course of which
ho said Englishmen rejoiced at their
bravery and deeds Just as much as they
rejoiced over the honors achieved by the
homo troops and their kinsmen from all
the colonies brought together by the war.
Colonel Otter expressed his tnanks for
the sympathetic utterances, and the Ca
nadians took the train for London.
LONDON, Nov. 29.â A detachment of 2tiO
men belonging to the Royal Canadian
Regiment, Colonel Otter commanding,
which has just reÂ«ched Kngland from
South Africa by the Hawarden Castle, ar
rived In London to-day and proceeded to
Kensfngton barracks. Since their arrival
at Southampton, where they were wel
comed by Major General Robert Mac-

erywhere been greeted with tumultuous
applause. 'Â¦

Luchoff, completely barring the British
advance, attacked Colonel Henry Hamil
ton Settle's column Tuesday morning.
After five hours' hard fighting the
Boers were expelled from the position,
losing heavily. The British losses were
small, owing to the fact that the British
adopted Boer methods of taking cover.
Colonel Settle occupied Luchoff yester

CAUSES A THRILL OF ALARM.
Great Britain Again Worries Over
Events in South Africa.
LONDON, Nov. 30.â The disaster at
Dewetsdorp has pent a thrill of alnrm
through Great Britain. The censorship
continues so strict that there Is no hotfe
of arriving at a clear conception of the
actual position of affair.* in South Africa.
For instance. Independent accounts of the
subsequent proceedings and the camure
of Dewetsdorp give ample details, * not
omitting to msntlon the capture of two
Boer wagons and a quantity of loot, but
thero Is not the slightest mention of the
surrender of Â«W British troops and two
guns, which were not even disabled, inas
much as the Boers were able to use them
against the British relief forces.
The "ubiquitlous Dewet" seems again to
have pot away, and so far there ia no
news that the captured British have been
liberated.
Taking Into consideration the enigmatic
al military situation north of the Orange
River, the smoldering rebellion in Cape
Colony, the rumors that France has prom
ised Mr. Kruser to press arbitration on
England If he is able to obtain the sup
port of Germany and that Lord Kitchener,
after all, Is not to be given the chief com
mand in South Africa, the British Gov
ernment will meet the new Parliament
next week at a.n exceedingly Inopportune
moment.
No attempt aras made to conceal the ex
treme irritation felt at the adoption of a
vote of sympathy with Mr. Kruger by the
French Chamber of Deputies. The morn
ing papers are unanimous in declaring
that no intervention of any kind will be
allowed to change the British policy.
The Daily Mail publishes an interview
with ilr. Zedtsman. a Loyalist member
of the Cape Assembly, who is now in Eng
land as a delegate of the vigilance com
mittee. Mr. Zedtsman admits the gravity
of the situation, but says he fears no gen
eral rising, although he thinks it may be
necessary to send troops Into the most
disaffected districts, Graef Reinet, Stek
enbosch. Worcester and Parrl, where the
mob riots are likely to occur. He advo
cates the proclamation of martial law and
expresses the -jp!nion that the "only thing
which prevents a rising is the lack of
arms and ammunition."
The Morniner Post, reviewing the situa
tion, says: "The surrender at Dewetsdorp
looks still worse In view of the suggestion
that probably half the towns we have
garrisoned in the territories of the repub
lics are in no better situation to resist at
tack."
The Standard describes the disaster as
'deplorable, unaccountable and, at the
present juncture, doubly unfortunate."
KNOX HEADS OFF BOERS.
Dewet's Men Battle' Fiercely and
Raiders Reach Orange River.
CAPE TOWN, Nov. .29.â General Knox,
by a rapid march of twenty-six miles, got
In front of General Dewet, placing him
self between the Boers and the Orange
River. Dewet is now believed to be go-
Ing westward to Join Hertzog at Boorn
plaatze.
Colonel Pllcher had a smart skirmish
on Tuesday, November 27, with part of
General Dewet's command, which was
convoying loot captured at Dewetsdorp.
The Boers retreated, abandoning a por
tion of the loot and a large number of
horses. Former President Steyn and
General Dewet were in proximity
to the scene of the fighting, but they
eluded the British. The Boers were so
tenacious that Colonel Pllcher's men
actually reached a position within thirty
yarns of them, where revolver shots were
exchanged. The Boers shelled the Brit
ish with fifteen-pounders captured at
Dewetudorp.
Ex-President Steyn and General Dc
wet, who were breakfasting at a barn
near by, rode oft to the westward, leaving
the front clear. The British casualties
were one man killed and six wounded
Several Boers who had been wounded
were found by the British.
Steyn and Dewet have been since re
ported to be encamped to the westward
between Helvia and the railroad, but the
command appears to have been cut up
into three bodies. District Commissioner.

take its part in solving- the world's prob

In this family the stronger members have
special duties and responsibilities. Self

nations and to the human race which can
not be discharged by a policy of selfish
Isolation. Our civilization owes a debt
to the uncivilized peoples. The demand
of duty, the logic of imperative necessity,
have crowded us into our present posi

forces of Ignorance and cruelty is a duty
we owe to them, to the world and to the
God of nations. Providence has pushed us

In Italy the work of Napoleon was more
completely undone. The Bourbons were
restored in Naples, the temporal rule of
the Pope re-established In Central Italy,
Genoa was annexed to the kingdom of
Sardinia., the sway of Austria extended
over Lombardy and Venetia and the prin
clpalltres north of the papal states were
brought to life egaln. To Austria also fell
the Illyrian provinces east of the Adriatic.
The task of the next half-century in Italy
was to undo all this laborious patchwork.
The most difficult task of the congress
was to settle the fate of Saxony and of
the grand duchy of Warsaw. In 1S07 Na
poleon had stripped Prussia of her share
in the second and third partitions of Po
land and erected this territory into the
grand duchy of "Warsaw and placed over
it the Elector of Saxony, whom he had a
few months before authorized to take the
title of King. In 1813 the Cxar enlisted
the aid of the King of Prussia In the gen
eral attack on Napoleon by promising: him
euch an increase of territory as would
restore his dominions to their extent In
1805. In the course of the campaign the
Prussians occupied Saxony and took cap
tive the Saxon King, while the Czar took
possession of the grand duchy of Warsaw,
planning a restoration of Poland under
himself aa King. The Czar agreed, there
fore, with the King of Prussia that Prus
sia should retain Saxony and himself the
grand duchy of Warsaw; but this en
largem^t of Prussia by the complete ab
sorption of Saxony was effectually block
ed by the other powers under the leader
ship of Talleyrand, and the final settle
ment arranged that Prussia should obtain
the promised restoration to her area In
1S05 by receiving a province of Poland
It was the original Intention of the four
allied powers â England, Russia. Austria
and Prussia,â to dictate the terms of set
tlement, but they could agree heartily on
one measure onlyâ the restoration of the
old boundaries of France. Their rivalry
offered the adroit Talleyrand the opportu
nity to secure for France a share In the
deliberations. Urging thit the main sig-,
niflcance of the congress was to sanction
the principle of legitimacy as against rev
olution and conquest, and that the powers
had been allied against Napoleon and not
France, that King Louis XVIII was the
legitimate King of France and must be
recognized as puch, and that as France
wanted nothing her recognition involved
no loss or sacrifice for the others, he won
his point and exercised no small Influence
on the result as the defender of the small
er states. The casaof the Netherlands
presented little difficulty. Of the old
united provinces a consolidated kingdom
was formed and assigned to the Prince of
Orange. To strengthen this kingdom
apalnst France the southern Netherland
(Belgium) was annexed to It. This union
of Holland and Belgium, one as intensely
Protestant as the other was Catholic. Ig
nored the wishes of the people, and the
artificial tie lasted only fifteen years,
when the Belgians revolted and were rec
ognized by the powers as an independent
kingdom.
The disposition of the territory between
the Rhine and the restored boundary of
France was perplexing. The guiding prin
ciple was to use it to give the stronger
neighboring states a solid footing in that
region as a defensive measure against
France, and it was finally settled that the
strong fortress of Luxemburg and the ter
ritory of that name should be given to
the Prince of Orange as a possession sep
arate from the kingdom of the Nether
lands. Of the rest of the territory on the
left bank of the Rhine, Prussia received
the northern and larger portion and Bava
ria the southern portion.
status of the territories annexed by
Franceâ the Low Countries, the territory
of the old German states on the left bank
of the Rhine, and of large sections of
Italy. Next came in importance the set=
tlement of the German question, what
should be done with the states of the
Rhenish confederation, and finally the
disposition of Saxony and Poland.
To settle these questions a European
concert was called to meet at Vienna.
Thither flocked in the fall of 1S14 the sov
ereigns and diplomatists of all Europe.
The states created, as well as those an
nihilated, in the last twenty years, equal
ly dispatched envoys to pusn claims for
the preservation or recovery of their ex
istence. The congress as a congress
never met; all the work was done by com
mittees, which drafted specific treaties
between the particular powers Interested

| these provisions were at the end in-

several casting three votes, then three
with two votes each, followed by tho
rest with one apiece. In the case of or
dinary business the grand duchies and
smaller states could vote down Austria.
Prussia and the kingdoms: on the other
hand, inasmuch as for the passage of
amendments or changes in the general
regulations either a two-thirds vote or un
animous consent was required, the great
states could always head off obnoxious
legislation.
The confederation was empowered to
provide for the common defense, against
war between the states and against any
states making a treaty Inconsistent with
the federal obligations. Under such a
constitution the union of Germany was
equally innocuous to outside powers and
to the privileges of the German princes.
They each pursued their own good pieaa
ure, showing calm Indifference to the
sluggish proceedings of the Diet. A real
union of Germany was not to come from
deliberations and the petty balancing of
interests.
In their restoration of the political
equilibrium of Europe the powers reso
lutely closed their eyes to a factor which
as -It Increased in weljcht inevitably would
upset their balance â the spirit of nation
ality as evinced in Italy and Germany.
Regarding this spirit as born of the revo
lution, they Ignored it In the formation
of states In 1S15. and trusted to the en
ginery of despotism to crush it. but In
vain. Their hostility to It was instinctive
and natural, for at bottom It was an ex
pression of the will of the peopleâ of a
people who. conscious of unity of lan
guage, of Ideas and aspirations, wanted
unity of government that they might?
count for their real worth in the polities
of the world.
The work of the congress of Vienna was
a series of lntrenchments thrown up bv
the conservative and despotic power's
from which to resist the attack of liberal
ideas. So successful at first that the Ger
man liberals characterized the rulÂ»Â» of
Prince Metternich (the dominant spirit in
continental politics) as that of Prince
Midnight (Mltternacht). the spirit of the
age constantly countermined these de
fenses until they crumbled a half century
later.

Diet, like the Congress of our own con
federation of 17S1. was a diplomatic, not a
legislative body, recommending rather
than enacting laws, and was composed of
delegates from the princes, as the Con

In neither body was there a direct repre

composition, however, the Deutsches

States of 17S1-S3. The thirty-eight states

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 80, 1900.
The empire of the French at the height
of Napoleon's power (1812) reached
the Elbe to the Pyrenees, and on the
south from the Pyrenees to a point
midway between Rome and Naples. The
recently established kingdom of Holland
and a long stretch of North Germany, the
mainland territories of the King of Sar
dinia, parts of the states of the church
and other Italian principalities had al'ke
been swallowed up. Spain. Switzerland,
the Confederation of the Rhine, compris
ing' a large part of Germany, the king
doms cf Italy and Naples, comprising the
parts of the peninsula not annexed to
France, and the newly created grand
duchy of Warsaw, a resurrection of
Poland, were all dependent on Napoleon.
In alliance with him were Austria. Prus
sia and Denmark-Norway. The collapse
of this Immense system imposed upon the
allied powers In 1311 the reconstruction of
Europe and the restoration of the equilib
rium of the political world. The work
that was accomplished was remarkable
on the whole for its durability, consider
ing ths whirlwind of changes that had
been going on for twenty year3.
The primary purpose of the allies In the
struggle against Napoleon was to restore
France to its former boundaries under
adequate restraints to prevent any fur
ther disturbance of the peace of Europe.
This Involved the determination of the
As the powers had in a way followed
the example of Napoleon In bordering
France with moderate sized states, so in
the main their reconstltutlon of Germany
was similar to his confederation of the
Rhine. The patriotic ardor whlrh Inspired
the war of liberation glowed with a deep
national feeling that could be fully satis
fled only with the establishment of a
united Germany, but the obstacles In the
way of such a consummation seemed In
superable. The restoration of the old em
pire was neither possible nor desirable,
and In the way of the establishment of a
federal union with power stood the mu
tual jealousy of Austria and Prussia, and
the ambition of the princes of the Rhen
ish confederation whom Napoleon had
made kings and who now looked forward
to becoming 1 European powers, not mere
members of the German family.
The constitution that emerged from this
conflict of Interests was a loose confeder

Defeats Carlisle Indians by a Score
of 17 to 6.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â The Columbia
football team to-day defeated the Carlisle
Indians on Columbia field ,ln this city by
a score of 17 to G. There were nearly 25,000
people watching the game, and they saw
as clean and accurate an exhibition as
ever has been put up on the grounds.
About the middle of the second half a
steady drizzle started in, making the ball
slippery, the playing dead and putting a
damper on the enthusiasm of the great
crowd. Two sensations marked the g \me,
the first a sprint of fifty yards by Weekes
for Columbia's first touchdown. His play
was partly due to the splendid Interfer
ence of Wright, who ran with Weekes all
the way down the field and blocked off
Carlisle's back man. The other feature
was a fumble made by Morley in a dan
gerous attempt at a fake kick when Car
lisle was only seven yards from the Co
lumbia goal. This sent the ball rolling
toward Columbia's goal, and Bain shot
through the line and fell on the ball just
over the line, scoring the touchdown for
the Indians. The other two touchdowns
made were made by Columbia pushing
Berrien and Austin over the line when
the ball was but a few yards from goal.
When the. two teams came on the field
It was plainly evident that Columbia had
weight in her favor. On the toss-up Co
lumbia won the goal and took the east
securing advantage of the slight breeze
that was blowing.
At first it was most anybody's game
but after thirteen minutes' play Colum
bia-had the ball on Carlisle's fifty-vard
line. Weekes took the ball and went be
tween Redwater. and Wheelock for the
first touchdown. Bruce tried to kick the
goal, but failed. Shortly after the kick
off the Indians got the ball to Columbia's
thirty-five-yard line and then tried for
through the line and blocked Pierce'a
kick. Columbia soon after got the ball
and pushed down on Carlisle's goal ''She
was five yarda away when Pierce punted
COLTTMBIA GAINS VICTORY.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 29.â Before
what was probably the largest
crowd that ever attended a
Thanksgiving football game In
this city, the University of Penn
sylvania team to-day defeated Cornell by
27 to 0. Once only during the entire con
test was the Quaker goal line In danger
Of being crossed by a Cornell player, and
during most of the time the ball was In
Cornell's territory. Pennsylvania won
the battle by straight, hard football. The
white and carnelian men played fiercely
at times, but no matter how hard they
tried, old Pennsylvania could not be halt
ed on her march to victory. The Quak
ers' main play was their famous guards
back formation, which they worked like
a machine.
Soon after the game began it became
apparent that the players of both teams
were not all in that primo condition which
is generally expected in big games. Cap
tain Starbuck. who has just recovered
from injuries, was forced to leave the
field soon after play was started. Cap
tain Hare also showed signs of lack of
condition and, although he did not leave
his team, he frequently was laid out.
True, he put up hla usual hard, aggres
sive game, but he failed to shine as bril
liantly, aa heretofore. It was his last
gamÂ© as a Pennsylvania player, and it
was expected he would put up tho great
est football of his brilliant career. Mo-
Cracken. who has shown as a star guard
and fullback for the past four years, and
who lined up for the last time to-day on
the Quaker team, also had to quit tna
game because of injuries sustained, by hla
Ihoulder. Nearly all the spectators In
the crowded Btands arose and cheered
him as he dragged himself from the grld
ll Tbe contest was rather slow and lacked
Bpirlt. Of thÂ« tew brilliant plays that
marked tho game, Potter's run of nftv
ttve yards for a touchdown outshone all
the others. The fleet halfback was given
the ball exactly in the center of the field
for a plunge tnrough the middle â¢ Â°L C 5 > J:
nell's line. Pennsylvania's big forwards
opened a hole big, enough for the pro
verbial horse cart to drive through the
Ithaca line. Potter f ell as he
was pushed Into the hole, but he kept his
feet and made a wild dash for Cornell Is
goal. After the Cornell men had recov
ered from the-ir surprise, four of them
started to chase after the little man with
the ball. Just as Potter reached the five
yard line one of Cornell's big linemen
grasped him around the waist, out Potter
managed to stumble over the goal line
for what proved to be Pennsylvania s
last touchdown. The great game was all
over in almost a flash. Next to Potter b
run was Morrison's sprint for thirt>
yards around Pennsylvania s left ena.
The Cornell men had lined up for a kick,
but it proved to be a fake move, and the
Quaker men were completely taken in b
tne maneuver. This dash of Morrison
aroused much enthusiasm among the Cor
nell spectators and for the next five min
utes the carnelian and white pushed the
red and blue down the field for short but
steady gains for a distance of fort>
yards, when the New York State team
lost the ball in an attempt to kick a field
goal from the thirty-yard line.
Outside of foregoing instances there was
was little brilliant individual playing.
Purcell and Morrison played strong foot
ball in the face of adversity. The other
Cornell men on the eleven did not get
much chance as the Ithacans seldom had
the leather long enough to give others
than the backs a chance to advance the
pigskin. For the Quakers. Hare ; and Mc-
Cracken did tho best work until they were
hurt. Teas and Wallace were not far
behind them, while the performances of
the two Oardiners and the halfbacks were
worthy of mention. a
The Quaker team had a tendency to
charge before the ball was passed, and It
was frequently penalized for this offense.
Pennsylvania's first touchdown was
made on pure line bucking and plunging.
She had the ball in mid-field and forced
it down to Cornell's fifteen-yard line,
where it was lost on a fumble. The Quak
ers soon regained possession of It on the
Cornell fifty-yard line and this time with
out losing the leather carried It by the
aid of the guards back to and over the
Ithaca goal line. The score was raised to
ten points by the Quakers on a field goal
by Hare.
Pennsylvania, after carrying the leather
to Cornell's five-yard line, was penalized
ten yards for off side, so Captain Hare
thought the easiest way to make a score
was to kick a goal from the field, which
he did from the twenty-yard line. Cap
tain Hare tried another field after the ball
had been pushed almost the length of the
field to twenty-five yards In front of the
Cornell goal posts, but the kick was low
and the half ended with the score un
changed at 10 to 0. .
A few minutes after the second half be
gan, Pennsylvania secured the ball on her
own fifteen-yard line on downs, and with
out losing the ball carried it ninety-five
yards for the third touchdown.
After Cross had made an unsuccessful
try for field goal from Pennsylvania's
forty-yard line, the Quakers again ret
their guard back machine to working
and slowly pushed Cornell back yard by
yard. Pennsylvania's last touchdown was
made by Potter on a flftv-five-yard run.
It Is estimated that 25.000 persons saw
the two teams play their last game of the
season.
The Pennsylvania- students at the con
elusion of the game signalized the victorv
by a great snake dance on the field, which
was led by the university band. . When
they had tired, the Cornell men formed in
line, ten abreast, and paraded over, the
gridiron, cheering for both old Pennsyl
vania and their own alma mater.

ROCK ISLAND, 111.. Nov. 29.â The game
between Northwestern University and the
State University of Iowa, played here to
day, did not decide the rival claims of the
elevens to the football championship or
the West, the score being 5 to 5 at the
close of a heart-breaking contest. The
game was witnessed by S000 people. While
the score was a tie, the honors of the day
were with Northwestern. The latter
kicked off, Iowa carrying the ball back
to tho forty-yard line. An exciting contest
followed, line and mass plays being inter
spersed with punting by both teams when
they found it Impossible to advance. Iowa
twice tried a place kick, which, each time,
resulted In a touch back. Otherwise the
ball was not advanced to within yards of
either goal. After twenty minutes' play,
Iowa punted from center. Northwestern
carried the ball back to the thirty-flve
yard line, when Eby captured the ball
on a fumble and. backed by splendid In
terference, sprinted to Northwestern'^
goal for a touchdown. A kick for goal
failed and the close of the half found both
teams struggling in Iowa's territory.
The second half was a repetition of the
first. After "twenty- five minutes' play
Johnson made a place kick from the twen
ty-nve-yard line and the ball sailed
squarely between the goal posts defended
by Iowa, tying the score. Neither side
scored In the remainder of the half.
Teams From the Northwestern and
Iowa Universities Play a Tie.
CHAMPIONSHIP NOT DECIDED.
After scoring their first and only touch
down, Michigan was unable to make ma
terial headway through the Chicago lino
on straight football, and Sweeney time
and again was forced to punt. A cleverly
executed false kick resulted In the longest
run a Michigan man made during the
game. Sweeney got around left end for
twenty-five yards on a play of this kind.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â Chicago 13, Michi
gan 6. The University of Chicago eleven,
â¢defeated for five times in succession,
wound up the football season of 1900 to
day by scoring: three touchdowns on Mich
igan, and, with the exception of a few
minutes In the first half, completely out
played them. Michigan scored first, get
ting the ball on a fumble well into Chi
cago's territory, and, by long plunges, in
which the old Princeton tandem forma
tion was frequently used, carrying it
straight down the field and across the
line. But this was their last chance for
scoring. Fifteen minutes later Chicago
had bucked its way nearly seventy yarda
and across the Michigan goal line. .Early
in the game Chicago (found a weak spot
in Michigan. It was at last tackle,, and
against this spot Perkins and Sheldon
were whirled until White, exhausted by
the terrific hammering, was forced to
leave the game. In the second half, with
the score 6 to 5 against them, the ma
roons, playing fast football, and showing
beautiful team work, started in to win.
Twice they forced the pigskin inside or
Michigan's five-yard line, and twice the
maize and blue, fighting under the
shadow of their own goal posts, held for
downs. But Sweeney's punting was poor,
and when for the third time Chicago
reached the same spot the Michigan for
wards gave way and the game was won.
Chicago's third touchdown came much
easier. Even after Bliss had relieved
\\ hite at tackle. Fell opened up big holes
for the maroon backs to plunge through
and when time was called for the end of
the game, Chicago was gaining from three
to ten yards on a down.

At the kick-off for the second half the
Indians began a fierce battle and rusned
Columbia hard. They nad the ball on
Columbia's thlrty-rtve-yard line and
Wheelock made a try for goal from the
field by a drop.kick. but failed. After the

ball down to Columbia's eleven-yard line,

Prir.gle lasted the game out at tackle and
played in his old-time- form. Little Hud
son was a good end. Womble's play suf
fered somewhat from the attention de
manded of him as field captain. Slaker
Seeley. Traeger and Raitt were towers of
strength to the Stanford team. Tom Mc-
Faiiden played great ball at end. and his
brother, who replaced Lee at center, falrly
won his spurs. Cooper played a creditabia
game at end.
When the referee's whistle announced
the end of the game, the Stanford crowd
went wild over the victory. The students
surged out upon the gridiron, hoisted tho
players upon their shoulders and marched
about the field. After a quarter of an
hour of this demonstration a procession
formed, with the Stanford team in an om
nibus leading it. The car'dlnal-coared band
followed and a IlnÂ« of students stretching
out for a block followed, singlnsr. shoutlaj;
and reeling in tha fantastic "serper.tin* "
In this manner the victors proceeded
along Market street to tho Stanford head
quarters at the PalacÂ© Hotel.
Early in the second half the Stanford
men began to play great ball. Slaker
plowed his way through tho line for lone
gains. Seeley and Erb and Hill prove-1
their ground-gaining ability. An off-side
play put Stanford back ten yards and
forced them to punt.
Tt-.e bands played, the students sang and
cheered and men and women kuighea arid
chatted, pleased, with the Joyous spectacle
ana ignorant of the terrible tragedy that
had occurred within a stone's throw of
the gridiron.
Stanford quarter, ran the ball in twenty
yards, making the prettiest run of thÂ©
game. Time for the first half was called
with the ball near the middle of the field.
During the fifteen minutes' wait be
tween halt's the California crowd was
jubilant and noisy, confident of a victory.
The Stanford "rooters" did their best, but
their joy was due largely to the failure
of the California team to score.

weather that the day seemed set apart
for racing purposes. Flags were Hying

destroylng and unpleasant.
The programme was good and bad in
spots, but the Autumn handicap, over a
mile, with a gross valuation of $5250, more
than made up for the discrepancies exist

ceptances, with an almost entire absence
of fault-finding among owners at the ad

paddle. The duo looked so splendidly sit

ting slight ia.vorites over the Hildreth
triumvirate, Vulcain, Gonfalon and Ban
gor and the result justified the confidence
reposed in them. Advance Guard, always
unfortunate, was allotted top weight, 120
pounds, and the SJoat three-year-old made
a noble but fruitless effort. The h retter

After Day's Hard
Work.
R. L. Taylor's Beauty Spot won the
Midweek reserve stake yesterday at Un
ion Coursing Park. Never before did this
courser show such continuous speed. In
the run-down s=he beat Bonaparte in a
runaway test, scoring 34 to her opponent's
3, following which tne took the measure
of Ladies' Choice, Brass Button and Sil
ver Cloud without a point being scored
apainst her. In the semi-final she took
the flag from Risky Attempt, a 3 to 1 fav
orite, by a score of & to 1, and beat May
Hempstead IS to 4 for the slake. For
hard running May Hempstead certainly
made a record lar beyond anything seen
at the park for a long time, if at ail, and
landed in second place at that. The talent
thought well of tier chances, even after
the severe work ehe had pone throujp,
and made the final a heavy betting one
by their continued play, mostly at even.
Outside of undecided going she ran up
a total of fi points to her opponents' 10.
Her work throughout the stake was of a
class shown only by top-notchers.
Seventeen short-ends landed. The sen
sation was Tapioca. He furnished
Thanksgiving puadlng for the pikers in
the first round, beating St. Helen at 8 to
3, and adding cream sauce to the dress
ing in the third, taking honors from Wild
Norah at odd? of 7 to 2. Tapioca was
ruts for Risky Attempt in the next round
and failed to score.

to be spanked yet, and ohe can'tkeep me
ln:tho house, because the doctor says -I
must have" fresh air and "exercise." Oh
I'm having a bully time.'.'â Chicago Post,

made noise that was now and then muf

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Strong nerves are just as essential to good digestion, as they,
are to cheerfulness of mind, strength of muscle or clearness of
skin. The intimate connection between the brain-cells and the-
nerve-centers of the digestive organs makes the one a reflection of
the weakness or strength of the other. Improper food; disorderly
habits, the use of stimulants and over eating may cause indiges-
tion; but the more common causes are grief, anxiety, irritability of
temper, over- taxing tho body or mind, worry, loss of sleep and
general nervous debility. Quiet the nervous irritation, soothe and
rest the weary brain and the digestive organs will gain- strength

John I*. Davie made a speech In opposi
tion to the amendments. He, said he be
lieved matters were best as they now ex
ist.
"Had the Board of Police and Fire
Commissioners been constituted as It- Is
by this amendment proposed It snail be.
requests by the City Council or members
of the Council In matters like the fore
going would not Involve the chief execu
tive. The proposed amendment is desira
ble for this reason. ! It will also place the
police and fire departments as far from
the illegitimate Influence of the Council
as It is possible to place them. For this
reason also It is a desirable amendment."'
After explaining the purpose of the :
amendments. Mayor Snow said he did not Â¦
feel called upon to advocate any amend
ment except the ones authorizing a gar
bags crematory and dredging, and the
amendment changing the make-up of the
Board of Police ana Fire Commissioners.
Mayor Snow Continued:
"You are aware that the Mayor, the
v-ity Engineer and the City Attorney an:
ex-offlclo Police and Fire Commissioners,
having control under the charter of the
police and fire departments of the city.
"At the very commencement of thÂ«Â»
present administration the members of
the Council, at an informal gathering,
made the astounding request that the
Chief of the Fire Department be re
moved, and also his first assistant, and
that two men, whose names were given,
be appointed in their places. No citizen
of good judgment, having the welfare of
the city and the efficiency of the fire de
partment at heart, could have granted
this request. The Mayor did not. and the
present Council has never forgiven him.
."1 assumed the office of chief executive
Â¦with the intention of jrrajitlng every re
quest made by the Council that would not
jeopardize the Interests which I had been
efceted to guard. This request did in
volve the welfare of the city.- The matter
was carefully weighed. The Councilmen.
whose attitude toward the chief executive
could make the administration efficient or
Inefficient; the influential newspaper,
whose owners were In sympathy with the
extraordinary request: the office seekers,
who desired to use the reorganized fire
' and police departmentsâ all the^e were
considered. The request of the Council
Involved too much and was refused. The
attitude of the legislative body has since
been one of disapproval of this act of the
Mayor, finding expression often In the last
eighteen months, to the disadvantage of
the city. . .
So spoke Mayor R. W. Snow last n!ght
at a meeting of the North Oakland Im
provement Club, called to cMscuss the
proposed charter amendments for whlc*^
an election will be held on December S.
The principal amendments propose to cre
ate a separate Board of Public AVorks
and a Police and Fire Commission, to be
appointed by the Mayor, beginning with
the successor to the present chief execu
tive.

"For the best Interests of the city. thÂ«
control of the police and fire departments
should be so far removed from the t dlc
tation of the legislative body that the re
fusal of the officers In control' to do the
bidding of the City Council can do no
harm to the city. Such la not the case
at present, nor never can bfe. as this
board is now constituted." ..--V

ON AMENDMENTS
On the way back Turner's Illness took a
more serious turn, and part of the time
he spent In bed. However, when the train
arrived In Oakland on Saturday night ho
was strong enough to walk to his home
on Sixth street. He then called a physi
cian who told him he had a mild form of
smallpox.
Jackson. Sanderson and Azmon also
commenced to complain on the way
across, but. like Turner, they laid It to a
cold. When they reached their respective
homes Saturday each took to his bed and
called a physician. They were Informed
that they had varioloid. ,
The men know of no other way that
they could have contracted the sickness
except that It might be on account of the
car they occupied having been previously
occupied by Chinese, wno left some dla
ease germs In it. ' â¢ -
Three of the sick men were members of
a crew that was sent to New Orleans to
bring back a Sunset train. Turner wu
deadheading his way with them. The men
were quartered In a basrgage car which
was reputed to have been occupied by
Chinese in transit across the continent on
a previous trip.
Several days after leaving Oakland Tur
ner became 111. He complained of head
aches and backaches, but thought he had
nothing more the matter with him than a
heavy cold. His companions took care of
him, providing all the comforts the dlngy
baggage car permitted. At New Orleans
Turner walked about the streets and min
gled with old friends for four days before
the start back 'n Oakland was made.
Four Sunset limited yorters who left
Oakland during the middle of the month
in a baggage car for New Orleans cams
back Saturday night last stricken with
varioloid. They are now quarantined .at
their homes in this city by order of
Health Officer Dr. J. H. Todd. who has
taken all the necessary precautions to pre
vent the spread of the disease. The vic
tims are William Jack3on. 1561 Grove

haj'py -n consequence, as they will now
have the opportunity, which has been
denied them for nearlv four years, of
taming money again.
There are ninety-seven inmates of the
iiome. Forty of these have been given
employment. As soon as the demand for
the output becomes firmer the rest â¢will
l>e put to work. Many of these unemployed
l.i present are strangers to the art of
broom-making, and will have to be taught
from the beginning. From eight to ten
dozen brooms are turned out each day
fay the present force. When the full force
:s at work the output will be about fifty
dozen brooms per day.
Already forty dozen brooms have been
cold. Orders are coming- la daily. The
average price per dozen has been $2 .a.
When the plant closed down under Super
intendent isanders' previous management
the inmates were working overtime to
supply the demand for its manufactures,
winch were being exported to Central
America, Hawaii. Australia and British
Columbia. It is the aim of the manage
ment to get back this lost trade.

make it up. Before Mr. Hays superseded
Sanders the average
monthly income was $1646. During
thÂ» last administration the home was un
successfully conducted, and ii was found

In pplte of Hunter's confession, which
was minute and fixed Arnold as lhe sec
ond footpad, the latter stoutly denied any
connection with the crimes, but the de
tectives have sufficient evidence on which
to convict both the prisoners.
This morning the prisoners were
stripped and their clothing was given a
thorough search. The result was the
bringing to light of a silk handkerchief
and a watch and chain which Mrs. Curtis
later identified as having been In the
chatelaine bag which the midnight foot
pads had taken away from her. Besides
this property v.as a small pocket mirror
and a small black purse which belonged
to Mrs. Fritzlnger. There were also two
small silk handkerchiefs for which the
detectives are seeking an owner.
The younger lad. Hunter, confessed his
guilt and told the Ftory of the two crimes
to the police this morning. He was taken
over the ground and his story was con
firmed by the finding of the chatelaine
bag at Twenty-fifth avenue and East
Fourteenth street, where the boys threw
it after the robbery of Mrs. Curtis, which
occurred two blocks away.
The boys were seen loitering around the
neighborhood of Washington and Seventh
etreets. Their actions attracted the at
tention of the patrolmen, who accosted
the wayfarers. The young men's replies
did not satisfy the policemen, who sus
pected something wrong, so the lads were
sent to the City Prison for further exam
ination.
With a portion of their plunder care
fully hidden .in their clothing, William
Hunter and Frank S. Arnold, boy tramps,
IT years old. who garroted Mrs. W. D.
Curtis at Friiitvale yesterday morning,
and Mrs. Silas Fritzinger of Hanover
street, Tuesday afternoon, were arrested
at 2 o'clock this morning by Policemen

Water Front Notes.
The" British ship Helensburgh arrived
here from Hull ""yesterday after a fair
passage of 139 days* On November 19
Thomas White, the boatswain, died from
natural causes and was buried at sea. *
The German bark Charles Gounod and
the British ship James Kerr both sailed
yesterday with cargoes of wheat for Eu
rope. There is considerable betting on the
outcome of the run, the Britisher being
the favorite in the pools. .
It was only by the greatest amount of
moral suasion that Captain Harry Struve
succeeded in keeping his crew aboard the
United States transport Hancock. The
crack ship of the fleet was chosen to
bring home the dead and when the news
was noised around the sailors and firemen
evinced a very decided Inclination to de
sert. At Honolulu nearly 300 bodies of
soldiers who had died during the war
were taken aboard, while at Manila
enough coffins were added to the list to
make the number of remains on board an
equal two thousand. As coffin after cof
fin was lowered Into the hold the courage
of the men sank Inch by Inch, and It re
quired a file of marines to . keep them
aboard just about sailing time.
The Hancock is scheduled to arrive here
about December 22.
Hancock's Grewsomo Cargo.
The four-masted bark Osborne arrived
here on October IS with a general cargo
and is still awaiting a chance to dis
charge. She measures 325 feet between
perpendiculars and In consequence re
quires one side of any wharf along the
front to herself. She is not so big that
there Is not wharf room for her, but then
the space she would leave after berthing
would be useless even for the accommoda
tion of a scow schooner. Chief Wharf
inger Henderson could not spare the room
and in consequence- the Osborne went to
Oakland. She came back to the stream on
November 15 and has ever since been
awaiting a chance to dock. Yesterday
she was taken alongside sections 1 and 2
of the seawall and both captain and crew
had a Thanksgiving service.

Hard Luck.
NO BERTH AVAILABLE.
The Australia has completed her maid
en run to Tahiti and judging from the
reports of the passengers it was a genu
ine success. The United Statea Consul at
Papeete entertained the passengers, and
the citizens of the Island guve all hands
a right royal welcome. There were enter
tainments aboard and receptions ashore
and the Australia was cheered on every
occasion.
The Oceanic Steamship Company has a
contract with the French Government to
carry the malls to Tahiti and the Austra
lia inaugurated the service. From now on
the company will run a monthly service
between here and the French possessions.
THE mall steamers Australia and
Zealandla both made port yester
day. The Zealandla got In shortly
after midnight and the Australia
about 8 a. m. The former came
from Hawaii and the latter from Tahiti.
Both vessels made good passages, neither
one running. Into the hurricane that has
caused so much damage In the Southern

IT TTAS a wise Judgment which lm T
pelled the Grau managerial forces to
interrupt the progress of the "Ring"
for the Thanksgiving programme!
r Full-fed and sleepy, even the brilliant
"La Boheme" failed to rouse the audience
to more than a la*y enthusiasm, though
the opera was equally well rendered as
on its first production last week. The
"glad ragS" were notably absent, too;
there was neither a weekday nor Sunday
atmosphere Jn the place, and with the
generally heavy and after-dinner air of
things I fear me much "Die Gotterdaem
merung" would have fared but hardly at
the hands of the audience.
It was a good house In point of num
bers, though not a crowded house, and a
still further proof in its size, of the fact
that the city has realized that other
operas, even outside of the Melba reper
toire, may possibly be worthy of hearing.
For of course Melba sang the Mimi part,
and with hardly a" varying shade from her
last week's rendering. Certainly one
cannot imagine it better sung, and as to
acting, next to Marguerite the singer has
done nothing better.
Miss Fritzi Seheff, who on the opera's
first Â¦ presentment was suffering from a
cold, was in charming voice last evening.
She gave us the daintiest of Musettas.
She looks the part and sings It in a man
ner worthy of acclamation.
The only change in the cast was in the
substitution of Saleza for Cremonini In
the part of Rudolph, and though Cremo
nini's was a graceful, tender and express-

mained after the service for a last look
at the calm g.nd peaceful countenance..
The re'mains were brought . from the
lower hall of the church at 8 o'clock,
members of '.the Gentlemen's Sodality
serving as pallbearers. They' were fol
lowed by the priests of St; Ignatius
Church, clad in their dark robes and
white soutanes. > .
The fathers seated themselves around
the altar. The body was placed In the
center aisle of the church and the face
exposed. The casket was surrounded by
lighted candles, the soft, steady 'glow
adding greatly to the solemnity of the
scene.
In deep tones the priests read the final
prayer for the dead. As the Latin
worda rolled from the lips of the fathers
the Immense congregation became im
bued with a sense of the solemnity of the
scene. Deep silence, in keeping with the
occasion, reigned, 1 and It was several
moments after the completion of the
reading before the people realized that
the impressive ceremony was over.
The body, of Father Varsi remained
all night in the church. This morning at
9 a. m. a simple low mass.will.be cele
brated, after which the remains will be
taken to Santa Clara for burial.
