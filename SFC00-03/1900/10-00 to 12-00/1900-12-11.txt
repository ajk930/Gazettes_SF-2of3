Late Prisoner of Filipinos Re
turns on the Hancock.
TERRIBLE TALE OF
CAPTAIN SHIELDS,
AN ARMY OFFICER
The captain says that few of the prison
ers escaped as luckily as he did. One man
who was captured was subjected to the
grossest cruel tie?, being bound on his
back and his nose and ears cut off and
eyes pulled from their sockets. Then he
was shot.
"A few days after I was taken prisoner
there was a clamor among the more ex
citable natives to have me put to death.
and for a week or more I did not value
my life at very much."
"They had me brought across the Island
to the west shore, and here I was allowed
to write' a letter to headquarters at
Santa' Cruz. General Hare replied, and
on the 14th of October the general reached
us in the gunboat Bennlngton, and the
next day we were sent to the Manila hos
pital.
VI was finally hustled away to 'a hut,
where theykept me for twelve days. Rice
was about all I had to eat. After the
twelve dayB I was forced to march, be
ing ., driven through dense thickets,
swamp's, rivers and Impenetrable Jungle?.
The other wounded were with me, and It
was terrible to see them suffer. Some
were barefoot and not a few had fe
vers which would; make the most hopeful
physicians look grave.
"Another fellow came up. loaded his
gun, aimed it at my head. and was about
to fire when . a hand ; pushed the barrel
away and I recognized my rescuer as a
sergeant ; in , the Insurgents' ranks whom
I had met at Santa Cruxi '.
"By this time the Filipinos were upon
us. One dirty fellow rushed up to me
and the. first thing he did was to remove
my cap, place It on his own head and
then jam his mud-besmeared straw hat
over my head. Maybe I wasn't mad.
Then he took my watch and chain and
everything In my pockets, and finally
tried to yank a couple of rings from my
fingers. They wouldn't come off, so he
whipped out an ugly looking knife and
was on the point of cutting off my fingers
when I managed to loosen the rings my
self. He. took them with a grunt and
hurried, off.
"Just as I -began to realize what had
happened one of the me.n who was carry
ing me -fell dead from a bullet wound. I
then saw it was useless for them to try
and save me, and I gave orders for. them
to hurry on and leave me with a hospital
corps van. After they had gone I ordered
a white flag to be hoisted, but It proved
a target for the Insurgents, who fairly
Iiitered it with bullets., .
over unconscious. I fell In about two feet
of mud and water, and It was the water
I believe that brought me quickly to my
senses. Two of my men had meantime
rigged a litter and were carrying me
along when I recovered consciousness.

Validity of Reno Marriage.
On Aucust 19. 1?37. the claimant secured
Â« divorce from Robert B. Smith. In the
following December she and the deceased
<V-j>artÂ»Â»d from this State for the sole pur
pose of intermarrying at Reno, Nevada.
Thr-re thry procured a license and on Jan
uary 1. JW. "submitted to the formalities
and to the ceremony of marriage as re
quired by the statutes of the sagebrush
Ptr.te." They returned to this city, where
thoy took up their residence as man and
wlfÂ«- and continued that relationship up
to the time of Joseph M. Wood's death.
At a recent date Mrs. Wood made an ap
plication for a family allowance pending
the distribution of decedent's estate In
accordance with the terms of his will,
under which she was named as benefici
ary- Her petition has been denied for
the reasons expressed in the court's opin
ion. After quoting the law of this State
prohibiting divorcees from remarrying
vlthln one year from the date of the de
cree secured. Judge Troutt says:
History of the Case,
the limits of this State within one year
from the divorce of either or both parties
was valid and. binding; that the laws of
this State recognize as legal and binding
eny marriage solemnized in accordance
with the laws of other State?, and that
the laws of this State could in no way
regulate those of other States regarding
tbe marriage contract. Judge Hebbard is
supported in his opinion by that of Judge
Smith of Santa Cruz, and hence the final
d*>cree o? the Supreme Court will be
awsited with Internet.
"Now I teke It that the dear intention
of the Legislature was that the divorced
parties could not remarry within the year,
In this State, and nothing whatever^ was
cald as to marriages outside of the State,
and the laws of Nevada likewise have; no
mention of the- remarriage of divorced
persons, divorced either in that State ' or
elsewhere ;.'_ . . â¢?,
"The gist of Judge Troutt's decision
made to-day is that the amendment to
section â¬1 of the Civil Code, which makes
the proviso of one year as to remarriage
of divorced persons, really means that the
divorced parties are not capable of remar
rying anywhere. ' . . . , Â¦
"Judge Hebbard, In the Adler case, re
cently decided that 'Nevada marriages'
were Illegal, and while It may have .been
the Intention of the California Legislature
to prevent divorced persons remarrying
within a year, still the amendment cov
ering that wos not properly drawn. Judge
Lucas F. Smith of Santa Cruz decided
the first of the 'Nevada marriages' to be
perfectly legal, anÂ«l he recently wrote'me
that he felt sure the Supreme Court
would uphold the legality of the cere- 1
monies.
"Judge Troutt has reversed himself in
this very case, and I am sure his decision
of to-day will not hold.
Attorney Timothy J. Lyons, who rep
resents Mrs. Wood, announced after read
ing Judge Troutt'B; decision that he al
ready had an appeal from Judge Belcher's
decision pending before the. Supreme
Court and would . Â«mmediately take the
same course In the action decided by
Judge Troutt. He said:
Attorney Lyons' Statement.
For the reasons stated it Is my conclusion
that the marriage, ought not to be recognized
by this court as valid. Accordingly the appli
cation for a monthly allowance out of this es
tate to petitioner as the widow cf decedent' <s
denied.
It I? to be presumed that very, few persons
have violated the provisions of our Civil Code
since Us amendment in 1S97. But If there are
pome who have disregarded Its reasonable pro
visions It iÂ» to be presumed ,that they have
made amends by contracting lawful marriage
at the earliest time possible. If children have
been born to parties to cucli unlawful mar
riageg they will not Buffer, for if their parents
should fall to right the -apparent wrong done
try them by contracting a lawful marriage, the
law by Its beneflcence has protected them by
providing that "the issue of all marriages nuil
In law, dissolved by divorce, are legitimate."

TWICE wounded, a prisoner for
thirty-one days, nearly starved
and subjected to mental and phy
sical tortures that only barba
rians are capable of Inflicting,
Captain Devereux Shields lives to tell of
his terrible experience at the hands of the
Filipinos. The captain "arrived In this"
city on the. transport Hancock yesterday
and la now at the Occidental.
With his head swathed In bandages and
his hearing partly gone, as a' result "of a
painful bullet wound, he sat nervously in
his room last evening and related the
story of his thrilling adventures in the
Philippinesâ a story that reads more like
fiction than, cold truth. .
Captain Shields was attached to the
Twenty-ninth Infantry Regiment. His
exciting times began on September 11,
when he left Santa Cruz on board the
transport* Villa Labos for ' Torrijos. a
small town on the east side of the island.
He had with him a detachment of fifty
two men. They embarked at Torrijos
without opposition.' The next morning
they came across a Filipino garrison a
few miles from the town." The Americans
drove off the sixty Filipinos who were
behind the earthworks after several
hours' fighting. The fort was then de
stroyed and the men returned to Torrijos.
The following day â a .memorable " thir
teenthâthe detachment started' back, to
Santa-Cruz, the intention being. to make
the bulk of the Journey afoot and inci
dentally "pick off" stray Filipinos.. /What
happened on that journey, which was
never completed,' is best told in the cap
tain's own words:
"We had gone but a short distance,'.'
said he, "when suddenly, a shower of bul
lets fell around us, and simultaneously
our scouts came running up with the In
formation that a large force of Insur
gents were on the cliff just above us.
Further explanation was not needed, for a
second, quickly followed by a third . and
fourth volley of shots came whizzing into
our midst- The Filipinos were in suclra
position that It was useless for us to an
swer the attack from our position, so I
gave orders to retreat.
Meanwhile four of our little band had
been killed and- eeveral others were
wounded. There must have been 250 in
surgents and they fired' from a distance
of less than 300 yards. As: we retreated
a bullet struck me in the left shoulder.
We made for a skirt of woods some four
miles off, and this is all that saved us
from complete annihilation. As we
crossed a rice field the Insurgents, who
had all along been three-quarters of the
way around us, closed in. I then had only
thlrty-f our t effective men, but resolved to
make a final desperate struggle, when a
mauser penetrated my neck and I toppled

plex marriage laws of the country, ren
dered a most important decision when he
was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

ing on the 'Nevada marriages.' He held
that a marriage which was prohibited
in Massachusetts by statute, because con
trary to the policy of the State law, was
yet valid "'.f celebrated elsewhere accord

ceremony was performed, even if the par

marriages out of the State were invalid
in the State."
UPER1OR JUDGE TROUTT has
!W - I,. added the weight of his opinion
-* 1 to those decreeing all marriages
entered Into by divorced parties
within one year from the date of
their legal separation null and void. An
order of the court, accompanied by an
opinion, was made yesterday denying the
IÂ«etition of Abbie Rose Wood for a family
allowance from the estate of the late Jo
t-eph M. Wood. The order was made on
the ground that the marriage of the Claim

ized in Nevada within one year from the
Â«Iate of Mrs. Wood's divorce from a for

be recognized as valid by the court.

present rate will have a full complement
within three davs. The train due here at
9:30 a. m. to-dav was the only train that
was late, and that but twenty minutes.
On the average our passenger trains have
reached Chicago as nearly on time as
though there were no strike. We are ac
cepting all freight offered and are mov
ing most of it. Fruit shippers have been
notified of our ability to handle shipments
up to the capacity of our equipment. All
of the" Important offices have been filled,
and all through husini-jsa is being handled
by orders from these points.
Third Vice President Barr of the Santa
Fe system, the official most active in ad
justing the operation of the road during
the strike of the operators, made the fol
lowing statement to-night:
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.â Officials of the San
ta Fe system claim that the telegraph
strike on their lines is practically over,
and point to the fact that almost without
exception their passenger trains were on
time to-day and that freight was being
handled in volume as great as before the
strike was inaugurated.

Mr. Rogers claims an ultimatum was

said Mr. Tlogers, "and the Idle statements

LOS ANGELES, Dec 10.â A report was
current in this city late to-night that all
of the operators on thÂ» San Joaquln divi
sion of the Santa Fe left their keys at 11
o'clock to-night.
_ Statements by local , Santa. Ke officials
nnd the striking telegraphers in this city
to-day wore widely divergent as to the
status of the strike. Railroad officials
claim that only six men left their keys
on the Â¦ Ban Joaauln division, and - theso
were taken back to-day upon making ap
plication for reinstatement. According to
the officials, the men claimed that the sit
uation had been grossly misrepresented
to them when they walked out.
On the other hand, General Chairman
D. G. Rogers of the local order of Rail
way Telegraphers said early in the even
ing that two-thirda of Â¦ the operators on
that division were out to-day and the re
mainder would stop work late to-night.
The Santa Fe overland arrived from
Chicago on time this morning and other
trains have arrived and departed regu
larly. General Manager Nevln. said to
night that the strike had Inconvenienced
the road only in that it had alarmed timjd
travelers. He said the statement that
freight trains were tangled up was abso
lutely untrue.
"To-night there are four offices In South
ern Californiaâ Mentone, Lordsburg, Rlal
to and West Cucamonga â and four on the
Santa Fe Pacific where the operators are
out, and men are on the way now to
take their places," ho said. "By morning
there will be an operator at every Instru
ment west of Albuquerque." ' .
In direct contradiction, Mr. Rogers says
conditions are more encouraging ; to the
operators than at any time since the
strike began. â¢ Â« .
Have Left Their Keys.
JOIN THE STRIKERS' RANKS.
All San Joaquin Operators Said Â¦ to
cs the telegraphers arc concerned, is ex
cellent. The forged telegram sent over
the line by the officials to-day In a vain
effort to set tho men back has done us
very little or.no damage, as only a few re
sumed work, but we have, and are still,
making every possible effort to reach all
and tel! them that It is a forgery, and as
soon as they learn of the contemptible
trick played upon them by the officials
they will go out and stay until ordeied
back by their local chairman, who will
be notified by me when the strike is off.
and another fake of this character will
be impossible. We expect to have fifty
per cent of those now working out within
the next twenty-four hours, and before,
the end of the week no one will be work
ing except the officials, and they will be
unable to get trains over the road. There
has been no change since this morning,
except we have been able to Induce some
of those working to quit.
"The statement sent out by the officials
that no strikers would be re-employed ia
of no force or consequence, for there ara
not enough idle telegraphers in the coun
try to fill our places, and the company
will be compelled to take them all back,
win or lose, and they know and realize
this, and their action In sending out the
forged telegram in a vain endeavor to get
the boys back and taking them back
wherever the scheme worked shows that
they are not honest in this statement.
That they. are- in the last-ditch, and are
making desperate efforts to keep the
trains moving is evidenced by their resort
to forgery and in the use of officials to
fill vacant offices. -We are using every
honorable means, and will resort to no
underhand work or disreputable methods
to win the strike.
"It is well that the' general public know
at this time that the Santa Fe Railroad
is now running its trams by the red
boards, which are the signals for train
orders without stopping for either a safe
ty, clearance or orders. This is a very
dangerous proceeding, and Â¦will sooner or
later end In disaster."

Captain Carter entered prison here in
April last. With one year oft for good be
havior he still has a little more than three
years to serve.
Judges Thayer and Hook find these pro
ceedings were entirely regular.
One of the chief contentions urged in
Carter's behalf was that the President's
reducing the number of specifications pre
ferred thereby made void the entire pun
ishment inflicted. On this point Judge
Thayer says:
"The punishment prescribed by the ar
ticles of war is attached to the charge
and not the specifications made thereun
der, the latter being merely by way of
exemplification and detailed statement of
the principal charge to which they re
spectively relate, but even if this were not
so, the rule is well established that when
one sentence in gross is pronounced upon
a conviction under an indictment con
taining several counts and upon a pro
posal or review some of them are held
bad and the others sustained the sen
tence will not be disturbed, provided It is
such as could lawfully have been Imposed
under the counts which were upheld. '

CHICAGO, Dec. 10.â The question of the
constitutionality of the Blaine extradition
treaty between Great Britain and the
United States, signed by representatives '

it is asserted, has never been passed upon.,
is to be brought befort? the United State-*
Supreme Court in the cases of Fred Lee
Rice, Frank Rutledge and Thomas Jones,
who were arrested in Chicago last June
on the request of the Canadian authori
ties, charged with being fugitives from
justice.
The specific chargea against the three
men include complicity in several bank
robberies in Toronto ajid other Canadian
cities. President McKinley issued a war
rant for the requisition of the three men,
but action was prevented by a writ of
supersedeas, issued by Judgo Kohlsaat. of
the United States District Court, an.l
Eince last June the men have been con
fined in the county jail.
Next Monday attorneys representing
the prisoners and the British Consul will
appear before the Supreme Court at
Washington, and bail Tor the prisoners
will be asked pending the construction of
the Blaine treaty. Attorneys for the Brit
ish Consul will move to dismiss the appeal
or advajice the case to an immediate hear

The case is regarded as one of great Im

ment offered Friday last *o the address,
and C. C T. Hartley. Conservative, repre

ment to the address asking the House
to express regret at the fact that Lord
Salisbury had recommended so many of
his own family to offices under the gov
ernment.
One-fifth of the Cabinet members, Mr.
Hartley said, were of the same family.
tsons would obey their father and sons
in-law and nephews would yield to the â¢
famf- influence. Such conditions precluded
an independent inquiry Into the army I
failurc-s in South Africa, and were eaieu
ian-d to impair gravely the efficiency of
the public service and diminish the
chances of refonm in the system of na
tional defense. The same canker worm
cf ntpotism had entered the army and na
vy, and it was the general opinion that
many cf the disasters in South Africa
wer* traceable to officers who had ob
tained their commissions by family influ
ence.
iVhen the Premier's nephew rose to re
ply the House was tilled with expectation.

because "this- cause might be used as a

since his brother managed the business
of that organization, but the company's
already small business with the Admiral
ity had decreased. He made some further
explanations of a similar kind. Mr.
Chamberlain exclaimed, amid ministerial
cheers:
"It is not hard to have to deal with such
rubbish as this. When all is reckoned up
perhaps my indirect interest in Govern
ment contracts is a few pounds or even
shillings. And yet the House of Commons
is called upon to pass a solemn resolution
which will not strike, byt will be a self
denying ordinance for many members who
do not anticipate that result."
In an eloquent peroration the Colonial
Secretary declared that the attacks had
not injured him, but had given pain to a
number of private individuals. Those
who had made them, he asserted, had in
troduced into public life unworthy meth
ods and had made it more difficult for
honorable and sensitive men to serve the
country-
He was loudly cheered as he resumed
his seat. His son. J. Austin Chamberlain,
Financial Secretary to the Treasury De

LORD SALISBURY ACCUSED
OF CARING FOR HIS OWN
WASHINGTON. Dec. 10.â The Senate
tpent almost five hours to-day in execu
tive session considering the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty. There wore five or six
speeches made. Â«=ome of them by Sena
tors who had not rpoken hitherto upon
the treaty, and others by Senators who
had previously expressed themselves.
Among the latter was Senator Morgan,
who returned to his former speech, elab
t rating somewhat his position as to the
effect of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. Hi!
took issue with Senator Teller as to the
purpose of the first clause of that treaty,
claiming that It applied only to Great
Britain's right to fortify the Nicaragua
canel itself. Senator Teller replied at
tome length. a.-serUng that the provision
was of more general import, as, he said,
any one couto ascertain for himself by
roacling President Bucha'.ans views upon
the subject when he was Minister to Ens
land The declaration then made showed
plainly, he t-aid, that England had at
tempied to extend her rignts beyond the
immediate vicinity of the canal. Teller
then proceeded to again elaborate his
views upon the etrierai subject, repeating
Ms declaration that thÂ«Â» L'ntted States
hhculd construct the canil. if at all, re
gardless of the English position and with
out going through the formality of rati
fying the pending treaty.
During the day speeches were made by
Senators Money. Stewart, Frye and
others. Senator Stewart announced that
he was for the treaty without amend
ment, and Senator Money that he was
against the treaty In any form. He want
ed the canal built as much as any Sena
tor could, he faid. but he considered the
pending treaty little less than an insult
to the intelligence of the American peo
ple. had no doubt that If proper dip
lomatic efforts should be made it would
be possible to secure the complete abro
gation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and
that was what he wanted. He did not.
indeed, believe the people of this coun
try would be satisfied so long as any ves
; Â£o of that instrument remained among
existing international obligations. That
convention, he said, was contrary to the
wishes cf the people of the United States,
and they could be satisfied only by den
nit eiy erasing it once and forever. There
also should be new conventions between
the United States and both Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, giving absolute control of
the waterway to this country. He wanted
no partnerships with any country In own
ership or management of the canal whan
built.
The possibility of Secretary Hay's re
signing in case the Foreign Relations
amendment to the treaty
should prevail having been alluded to,
Senator Krye said lm was In a position to
make official denial of that report. Th<?
Rfcrrtary had no such Intention. Frye
announced himself as favorable to the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty. He said that,
deny the effect of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty as much as we may, it still is on
Jhe international records of this coun
try, and is given more or less recognition
by any administration that has to deal
with the construction of an Isthmian
canal. It had been a constant source of
vexation in connection with the canal
subject, and he apprehended that It would
continue to be such until that portion of
it relating to the canal should be dis
posed of. IJe was satisfied.- for. Instance,
that the canal would have been construct
ed during the administration of President
Arthur if the old negotiations had not
been in existence.
Senator Chandler asked Senator Frye to
make Secretary Hay's position with ref
erence to resigning public, but the Maine
Senator declined, saying that he was
only authorized to make the statement In
the Senate. Chandler retorted that to do
that was equivalent to giving it to the
public, and the Senate then lapsed into a
diFCUPsion of the ways and means In
which the executive secrets get into the
newspapers.
A EUROPEAN COMMENT.
Figaro Says That Jingo Animates
the American Senate.
PARIS. Doc. 11.â The Herald's Euro
pean edition publishes the following: An
editorial in the Flparo says: The state of
mind which the Times describes as jingo
animates the American Senate during? the
discussion of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
The Senators at Washington wish to In
crease the Influence of the United States
in the Central American republics and
to diminish to the same extent the pres
tige of those European states which still
possess colonies in the Western Atlantic
in a word, to make of an oceanic canal,
conceived by an idealistic Frenchman as
a means of bringing people tog-ether, a
work of jealous surveillance and domina
tion.
The United* States means to set a Gi
braltar on the Nicaragua canal, what
ever it may cost. To attain this end.
some of the Senators are reviving: again
in England the maxim dear to Chamber
ialn, that a treaty should not prevail
against the interests of a people. The
American people have no understanding
why restrictions laid by the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty on the exercise of the ripht of
dijrjring a trans-octanic canal should aot
be abolished by the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty.
The American Secretary of Foreiprn Af
fairs already has need of much tact to
make his fellmv citizens pardon his taste
for English society r*nd for the English
Cabinet. It is difficult to see how he will
persuade the Senate to give up an im
portant advantage for a question of prin-

TWO LIVES LOST IN
THE HUSH FOR GOLD
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10.â Dan Barry, of
Middletown, Ohio, was bumped over the
railroad from Burbank to Los Angeles
this morning under tho Owl train, think
ing that every moment would be his last.
Harry formerly worked in Los Angeles.
The idea took him while in Oakland last
night to take fortune by the forelock and
get back to his old job. Not having much
money in his possession, Barry decided to
beat his way to Los Angeles by the
brakebeam route. Ho stealthily crawled
under the limited train in Oakland and
took his place on the trakebeam for an
all nizht ride.
Everything went well until the train ar
rived at Burbank. Barry liad counted
fourteen stops but none of the train men
had chanced to ft-e the pasaenger under
the car. He had $13 50 In ensn upon his
person, and it was his intention to get off
the tram at the last stop outside of Los
Angeles and to pay his fare to town, in
order to avoid arrest. At Burbank tho
train stopped fcr an Instant. There was
his time to alight, he thought, and no
begran to scramble cautiously down from
his perch. But the train started before
he could crawl between the wheels. Had
he been an instant voonor his body would
have been cut in two by the revolving
trucks. As It was, it whs with the utmost,
difficulty that he threw his feet over this
brakebea.ni and caught a convenient rod
with one hand. Suspended in the air and
Just grazinp the ties, he felt every revolu
tion of the wheels. His body was swayed
Â¦with violence against the projecting bars
and twice his hands came into contact
with the flanges of thj trucks. Shrieking
in desperation, Barrv tried in vain to
make known to those on board his dread
ful position.
Twenty-one years of age and athletic,
he held on with grim determination, de
eplte the terrible bumps received as tho
cars rounded the curves and sped across
the eleven miles that separated the city
from thÂ« last stopping place. He was
Bhockin&ly bruised across his back and
arms and over his eyes. Even his shoes
gave way, and his clothing was torn into
shreds.
Bruised, bleeding- rind half-conscious,
the quivering man held on. The train
men pulled him out, almost dead and
gasping for breath at River station. Bar
ry was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where he related his experience. By nls
direction, a message was sent to a young
lady, whom he had hoped to meet under
more favorable circumstances. MIbs Mary
C. Housell quickly responded to the call,
and accompanied him to the County Hos
pital. Hp will be cut in about a week

Special ZMspatch to ThÂ» Call.
BUISUN. Dec 10. â Howard Morris
walked into Peter A. Flnne-'s O K saloon
on Main street just before midnight last
night, leveled a shotgun at the pro
prietor, who was standing behind thÂ» bar.
and pulled both triggers. Tfce first
charge lodged in a beer chest and the
second In Flnne's left arm. Inflicting a
serious wound.
Night Watchman D. C. McDonald at
tempted to arrest Morris. The would-be
assassin exclaimed:
"Don't come near me; you can't take
me. I've got another load In the gun."
McDonald, however, walked up and
took the gun from Morris.
It appears that after Morris had fired
twice at Flnne he walked across the
street, reloaded the gun and again dis
charged both barrels. Judging from a
powder stain on ds forehead and the
wrecked condition of his hat, Morris
either attempted suicide or wished to cre
ate the Impression that he was mentally
deranged.
After the shooting-. FinnÂ© went to Dr.
Downlng's office and had his injuries at
tended to. He said that he had had no
quarrel with Morris. The latter came into
his place at 10 o'clock in the evening and
had a bottle of sodawater. There were
two men In the saloon at the time of the
shooting.
After Morris was arrested he told Of
ficer McDonald that he had nothing
against Finne and that he was crazy
drunk when he attempted the murder. Ha
was willing to go to jail, and asked the
officer to take him there as soon as pos
sible, as he was afraid he might be at
tacked by a mob. Â»On reaching the jail
Morris' pockets were^found to be loaded
with ammunition. w
Morris is an odd character. He came to
Suisun from Salt Lake City about four
or five years ago. Yesterday he had been
drinking heavily, but never before whllo
under the Influence of liquor had he
shown a vicious disposition. He la about
22 years of^age.
Cons-table Downing this morning found
evidence that indicates that Morris"
crime was premeditated. Morris -went to
a buggy ehed on the wharf and with a
hammer broke the locks and effected an
entrance. There he obtained a rifle, but
found the shells In his possession were
too short for It. He afterward went to a
barn and obtained the shotgun.
Finne's wound is very serioua. kdA he
may not recover.

IX)S ANGELES. Dec. 10.â The expected
l.as happened: the Standard Oil Company
Las become cne of thÂ« largest producers
Ot oil In California. A deal has Just been
com ummafG whereby the Standard Oil
Company acquires all of the interests of
the Pacific Coast Oil Company. The pur
chase price is said to be in the neighbor
hood of J1,OOO,O>>J. For several months It
has been known that the Standard had a
desire to "get into ih.e oil business in this
State and had several representatives here
taking over the field and "ge'tlug: a line"
on good propositiont. The entrance of the
4;reat corporation into the Kern lllver
litHd caused considerable comment among
some of the producers there, who thought
Uiey could see all sorts of dire happenings
Â«ls & result. The Oil Storage and Trans
portation Company was organized and
"zru:ans of defense" provided, and it grad
ually became noised about that the latter
organization tutd "captured all the pro
duction and hud the^fitandard on the liip,"
although the work of erecting large Â»tor
*4e tanks by the big company continued,
and people began to wonder where the
feiandaxo. would set its on to nil these
Although it appears that the Kern River
field w;ii the tint in which the Standard
became interested, it also was apparent
Xha.1 there were other sections of the State
almost as tempting, and it Â«Md not take
tile representatives of the oil trust a great
wliile to discover the fact. From different
sections of the State have come at differ
ent times reports that Standard agents
were "looking over matters."
The Pacific Coast Oil Company is one of
the oldest, largest and most substantial
oil companies in the Staxe. It has been
doing ousi.'iess in California fcr a quarter

HE Russ House has a new bell

When the Seventh Artillery of
Washington passed through the Pan-
American Exposition city last summer en

The blare of the drums and the glitter
of brass buttons and swords were too

resolution firmly rooted in his brain he

"Where are the chips?" protested the
guest. "Will you please bring me up
some chips?"
The bell boy of two days hustled down
stairs and made a bee line for the bar
room.
VGlm'me some chips," he shouted to
the bartender, with the air of -a profes-*"
slonal gambler. A roll of poker chips waa
deposited carefully on the tray and the
youth scampered back to the guest's
room. The woman nearly fainted when
sha (jaw the card chips.
The Buffalo youth says he procured tho
kind of chips they used over in the Philip
pines, and that he supposed, of course?
there was but one kind to be had here.
So it happened that Woelfllng went to
the Philippines. According to his story he
was in the thickest of several hot en
gagements with the Filipino rebels, and
it was just because he was on the line
of march that the commander ordered
him back to the United States. He came
home on the last government transport,
drifted into the Russ House in search of
a job and got a place as bell boy.
Sunday was his second day "on." One
of the lady guests rang for a bell boy and
young Woel fling answered. The guest

Some time in July, 1S34. tha American

only lasted until October of that year, and
though the two todies have a friendly un

The differences between the two home

votes of proxies he produced and carried

this country are coming to the conclusion
that Tod Sloan's career as a Jockey is end
ed. The ban on .him seems to be world
wide. The opportunity for a man who Is
considered by many the greatest Jockey
of his time Is narrowing down to so small
a compaes that It is now only a remote
possibility that he will ever throw his leg
over a horse again in a race. '
The French Jockey Club, under its rules,
seems to have no alternative but to refuse
him permission to ride in races run under
Its jurisdiction.

I The North residence was badly gutted
by the flames. Mrs. North had accumu
lated quite a museum of curiosities dur
ing her vacation trips and many of these
were destroyed. The actual damage to
the house and contents will probably
amount to above $5000, as a valuable li
brary, piano and organ were destroyed or
badly damaged by water.
When the fire started Mrs. Anderson,
mother of Mrs. North, was lying on her
bed in an upper chamber, being an inva
lid. The house was filled with smoke, but
Officers O'Connor and McDonough rushed
in and carried Mrs. Anderson out to a
place of safety. It was necessary to
knock out a number of boards In the fence
in order to avoid' the flames, which were
mounting higher each moment before tho
arrival of the engines. As soon as the of
ficers succeeded in getting the helpless
woman through the fence she was taken
to the residence of Captain Leale of the
steamer Bay City, and made comfortable
for the night. Â¦
While Fire Marshal Towe was about to
enter the burning residence he slipped on
the pavement approaching the place and
was unable to rise. He was hurried off to
the Receiving" Hospital, where Dr. Put
nam found that bis left leg was badly
sprained. After treatment he was sent to
his home.
A fire in the basement of the residence
of Mrs. E. M. North, 2414 Pacific avenue,
about 9 o'clock last night was productive
of disastrous results to Fire Marshal
Towe and made heroes of Police Officers
J. B. O'Connor and W. P. McDonough.

INSTRUCTED IN" COURT
An Application for Their Release on
until the close of the ca3e the court will
open at 9:J0 in the morning instead of 10
o'clock.
The first witness yesterday morning was :
L. W. Decker, a wholesale cigar sajeti- i
man. He was in the grocery store at
Turk street and Van Ness avenue about
7 o'clock in the morning the day after the
murder of Mrs. Clute. When he entered
the barroom In the rear cf the store Hurt
and several other men were conversing in
front of the bar. The witness heard Hoff
say, "I am very s>orry; she was a very
nice lady, and this affair puts me in a
bad light." He walked up to Hoff and
asked him if he was the carpet-layer. Tha
defendant replied in the afllrmatlve. Deck- Â¦
er asked him if he wa3 working at SOi
Guerrero Etreet the day before. Hoff said
that he was, and witness then advised
him to go to police headquarters. HofT said 1
that he would.
Harry Is'eemeyer. clerk of the Lindell j
House, was recalled. He identified the Â¦
clothes in the courtroom as Hoff's. He
also identified the carpetbag as the de- â¢
fendant's work satchel. â¢
John Freres, who formerly kept a gro- '
eery store at 119 Seventh 3treet. testified I
that Hoff came into the witness' store [
about 7 o'clock on the evening of the
murder and complained that he had in- 1
Jured his left hand. He explained that j
the way he hurt his hand was picking up â¢
a plank with a nail in It. He poured some
whisky on the wound of Hoff's hand and â¢
bound it up. The defendant left his store j
and told him tnat he was going up on t
Van Ness avenue. !
Henry Dierck3. one of the proprietors of
the grocery store at Turk street asd Van
Ness avenue at the time of the murder. I
was the next witness. He proved a very
poor witness. He saw Hoff on the morn
ing of December 16. and testified that Hoff
read the newspapers about the murder In
his store and that the newspaper shook
while the defendant was holding it. His
evidence was , of no material benefit to
either side.
Thomas Hannon was in the saloon on
the morning after the murder. He was
reading an account of the murder out
loud. Hoff entered while he was reading
the latter part of the story. When the
witness finished reading the story Hoff
seized the newspaper and sat down neat
the stove and began to read- it. At the
close of his perusal he exclaimed, "This
looks very bad for me." Hannon advised
Hoff to go to Captain Lees and give an
account of himself, and that if he had not
done anything wrong that the police
would release him.
Ex-Chief of Police I. W. Lees was the
next on the witness stand. He testified
that Hoff called at poltce headquarters
the day after the crime. Hoff told him
that when he left Mrs. Clute's house there
was a strange man with her upstairs;
that he left the house by the back stairs.
Hoff told Â¦witness that he hurt his hand
by cutting it with a tack that was in a
piece of matting that he was working on
the day before. Lees said that no blood j
was found on the defendant's clothes and :
that in his opinion Hoff changed his gar
ments before he arrived at police head
quarters. Hoff told him that he was half-
Jew and half-Irish and that he had adopt
ed the Methodist faith.
J. J. Zimbelmann testified that he had
occasion once to go to Hoff's workbag
while working in the same house as the
defendant; that he found a coupling pin
In the bag similar to the one in evidence:,
that he was afraid of Hoff and considered
him a dangerous man; that Hoff had been
in the habit of carrying a piece of lead- 1
Eipe about a foot long for protection, as
Â© claimed. >
Police Officer Feeney was the last wit
ness. He will continue his testimony this
morning.

The State Board of Railroad Cotnmls
rioters was to have given the Santa Fe
Corrpany a hearing yesterday on the com
plaint of the Los Angeles Traffic Associa^
lion for alleged discrimination in freight
f.nd pELSsengtr rates, but owing to a com
plicates point of law the hearing was
postponed until Thursday. The question
-.vas raised at the meeting that if the com
missioners frhould vote to change the
rates the action would bÂ» likely to conflict
â¢with the decision of the Supreme Court,
â¢which now has under consideration the
rate case of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. If the Southern Pacific is compelled
by iho Sui>rÂ«ne <7ov.rt to establish a lower
rate to fean Joaquln Valley points the
Bauta Fe will have to adopt a correspond
ing rate.
The coTirniFsir.ners voted to ask th-a
opinion of Attorney General Tlrey I*.

should be the Judgment of the board, than

Harry Hill, a roomer at the St. David
House, 715 Howard street, reported the
loss of his clothlrg and other articles
to Police Officers Tulte and Tyrrell on
Howard street yesterday afternoon. The
officers, after, making an investigation of
the premises,' paid a visit to a room oc
cupied by Henry Dunham in the BamÂ©
building and there found all of the ' ar
ticle* which had been removed from Hill's
room. Dunham was placed under arrest
and booked at the City Hall station on
a charge of burglary.

ed on August 4 last, lias been arrested in,
Salt Lake City, and the necessary papers
for his extradition on the charge of fel
ony embezzlement will be forwarded with
out delay and an officer sent to bring him
Duff was looked upon by his employers
as an exemplary young man, and had
their entire confidence. He lived with his
wife and three-year-old daughter at 1214A
Vermont street. He spent Friday night,
August 3, at hla home and aaturday
morning left as usual for the office with
out showing any sign of anything betntf
wrong. He was at tho office Saturday,
but that was the last seen of him. His
accounts were examined, and it was at
once seen that he was a defaulter.
The case was put into the hands of pri
vate detectives, but no trace of Duff could
be found. On November 5 Benjamin
Gunn happened to be in Salt Lake City,
and while driving around he espied Duff
walking on the street. When- he returned
here Gunn notified the police authorities
at Salt Lake to arrest Duff, but nothing
was done. Saturday he called upon Cap
tain Seymour and the captain wired the
Chief of Police at Salt Lake City to ar
rest Duff, aa he was wanted for felony
embezzlement. Yesterday morning he re
ceived a reply that Duff had been ar
rested. Captain Seymour at once notified
Gunn and he swore to a complaint before
Judge' Cabaniss charging Duff with felony
embezzlement,- and the necessary papers
for his extradition were promptly pre-
The amount charged in the complaint as
having been embezzled by Duff is J1000,
but Gunn says that it will exceed that
sum What Duff did with the money is
a mystery, although it is hinted that lie
played the . races and frequented tha
"tenderloin.", At the time of his disap

'In addition to that which .was Justly
coming: to me for my labors on behalf of
Melone, the Jury has. also vindicated me
of the outrageous charges made against
me." said Judge Wallace to his attorney.
Melone and his counsel said nothing.
Ex-Judge Maguire Immediately entered
Into an explanation regarding the rela
tions existing between his client and Wal
lace, which, he said, were both of a
friendly and a business nature. Both were
business men and operated on business
principles, and, said Maguire, every busi
ness man knows that had there been an
agreement as to the division of large
profits it would have been in writing:
Judge Maguire, by Innuendo, then en
deavored to convey to the jury the con
tention of the defense that the McCauley
letter exonerating Judge Wallace was not
written by McCauley.
"How did Judge Wallace receive this
letter at San Jose as he said he did?" said
Maguire. "The letter brars date of June
22, 1882, and Is addressed from Ban Fran
cisco. The envelope Is stamped, but no
postmark cancels It. Neither does the en
\-elope show that It ever went through the
malls, and yet Judge Wallace says this
came to him and was laid on his desk In
his private rooms. I think his statement
unworthy of serious consideration, and
shall ask that it be given no weight when
you come to your final deliberations."
Judge Maguire then went over the fig
ures of the case and referred at length to
Judge Wallace's connection with tne ef
forts to collect on the Placerville bonds
Judge Wallace's effort during the last few
years, Macnlre said, was as laborious as
that which amused MIcawber, "waiting
for something to turn up." Judge Maguire
closed and Mr. Campbell arose to make
the closing argument.
"Not content with creating the Impres
sion that this aged plaintiff has been con
nected with schemes of bribery and cor
ruption," said Mr. Campbell, "opposing
counsel would now have you believe that
he is guilty of the forgery of the McCau
ley letter. I am ashamed to be a member
of this bar when I am forced to thus
learn that there are men â¢ who â¢ occupy a
similar position in life who will take ad
vantage of the means adopt ad by opposing
counsel to savo his client, from the pay
ment of a just and honest debt.".; :
Judge Maguirc made noanswer to Mr.
Campbell's remarks, and he continued un
interrupted to the end of his argument.
Judge Seawell charged the Jury and It re
tired to deliberate on ' a Â¦ verdict. , A 1 half
hour later the Jurors returned to the
courtroom for further. Instructions. They
were given, and an hour later the verdict
was returned as stated.
"He did not disdain to besmirch tho
character of this venerable Jurist, who is
now approaching the aere and yellow leaf
of life, and bequeath to his children and
to his grandchildren. If possible, a legacy
of shame. He raked Hades' half-acre^ for
what? For anything that would prevent
him from parting with his gold, withheld
dishonesty from his just creditor. Why
did he bring up this Infamous McCauley
episode? He did so in the belief that
Judge Wallace would not seek to enforce
his rights In court. You have seen the
McCauley letter, however, which exoner
ates Judge Wallace and that effectually
disposes of Melone's claim for his alleged
Bervice In quieting McCauley and pre
venting further statements on . the sub
ject of bribery."
Attorney Campbell then went over the
figures presented in the case. These, he
eald, showed that Mr. Melone's profits In
the sale of the Placerville bonds were
over $20,000, and that" according to the
agreement between him and Judge "Wal
lace the latter was entitled to every dol
lar he demanded.
"Melone, forgetting his friendship for
Judge "Wallace, forgetting that he had sat
at Judge Wallace's table time and again
and dipped into his salt with him, and
forgetting that he had red blood In his
veins and filled with the lust for gold,
drags this Infamous scoundrel McCauley
into the case for the purpose of evading
the payment of an honest debt.'
"i-'rom the statements of this man Me
lone, given on the witness stand, he wouid
have you believe he was a capper for
Judge Wallace, who occupied tne mghest
Judicial office within the gift of the peo
ple of California. Great stress has been
placed by the defense in this action to tho
statements of McCauley at San Jose that
he had paid $5000 to L.loyd Tevis, to be
used for the purpose of Influencing Judge
Wallace in McCauley's behalf in a case
then pending In the Superior Court. Mc-
Cauley is a drunken vagabond, who stood
at a street.corner belching forth his slan

the Michigan State Convention of ISil
-in the month of June, and thaf upon "the
suggestion of Horace Greeley in a lettc

candidate under the Republican party as
now recognized was John C. Fremont in
1856. The party was organized in Febru

until June following.
THERXfOMETERâ A. S.. City. There
are three kinds of thermometers in gen
eral useâ Fahrenheit in the United States
and Great Britain; Reaumur in Germany,
and Celsius or centigrade in France The
latter is used almost exclusively by scien
tific men of all nations. The relation of
these scales are shown by the following*
Fahrenheit ........ 0 32 77 122 2T>'
Reaumur .......... 0 20 40 so
Centigrade = , 0 25 50 100
In the F. scale the freezing point is 22
and the boiling point is 212, so that the
space between these is divided Into 212â
32 or 180 equal parts or degrees ; in the
others the freezing point is the zero but
the boiling point i3 80 and 100 respectivetv
It is easy to reduce from one of thesÂ«
scales to another. Thus the C reading for

Such a report directs public attention once more to
the issue of so reforming the postal laws as to pre
vent an abuse of the second class mail privilege.
That issue has been before the country so long and
has been so generally discussed it is hardly' necessary
to go over the arguments concerning it. The one
point to be noted is that the suppression of the abuses
will at once provide the Government with a sum suffi
cient to extend the rural delivery system. We have,
therefore, tp choose between losses on the one side
and benefits on the other. It is no longer a question
merely of putting an end to an evil, but also one of
providing a far-reaching improvement not only in the
postal service but in the conditions of rural life.
The Postmaster General estimates that the net an
nual cost of a complete rural free delivery system
would be $13,772,000, fend then says if "a class of pub
lications which now, under an evasion of the purposes
of the law, pay the second class rate of postage, were
really made to pay the third class rate, as they ought
to do, it would bring an additional revenue to the
Government of $12,343,612. The cost to the Govern
ment of this abuse is almost exactly equivalent to the
estimated cost of broad national rural free delivery,
and if it is a question between favoring a very limited
number of publishers'and favoring twenty-one millions
of people who live on the farms of the United States,
there ought to be no hesitation in serving the many
rather than the few."
It is to be hoped the' presentation of the issue in
that way will have the effect of arousing public senti
ment. Congressman Loud has fought for 3'ears â¢ to
bring about a remedy for the defect in the law which
permits such abuses to go on, but his efforts, have
been in vain. A powerful lobby is at work on the side
of those who profit by the abuse, and by one means
01 another every attempt at reform has been baffled.
It is evident that a resolute demand will have to be
made by the people in order.to get Congress to act,
and that demand should be made this winter.
It is to be borne in mind the proposed reform will
not in any way conflict with the interests of those who
have a legitimate right to the second class privilege/
As the Postmaster. General says: "It is only sought
to cut off the abuses which the law never contem-

that free rural delivery has proven of great benefit to
the people and should be extended; third, that the
loss to the Government by abu*es of second class

!t will be seen from these quotations that while the
prospects of the enterprise are good, the3' are not un
douded. The situation is one that will bear watching.
While the fight is being made against the treaty the
advocates of the Panama route are busily engaged in
a campaign of education against Nicaragua. Thus the
Philadelphia Record .recently said: "Prejudice
against the Panama company was so industriously
instilled in the minds of the American people by the
boomers and lobbyists of the Maritime Canal Com
pany of Nicaragua during the lifetime of that mori
bund, subsidy-hunting concern as to make it quite
possible that the members of the commission were
unconsciously affected thereby to overestimate the
difficulties of the Panama route and to underestimate
those to be overcome in the Nicaraguan project At
any rate, engineering authorities as competent as arc
the members of the Isthmian Canal Commission ha\e
examined and re-eximined the Panama company's
work and found that it could be completed for $100,
000.000. including cost of administration during con
struction and interest on capital. Here is a possible
margin of over $100,000,000 in favor of the latter un
dertaking, and the very complete reports on the same
of the Cotnite Technique, a body composed of world
famous engineers, might be consulted by Congress to
the advantage of the Federal treasury."
As an illustration of the sentiment in some influen
tial quarters it is to be noted that the New York
Times recently said: "If the Hay-Pauncefcte treaty
fails of ratification in the Senate and the Hepburn
bill is passed and sent to the Pre c ident, he will be com
pelled to veto it."' ThÂ«n the Times adds: "Is not
th2t what the opponents of the treatyare driving at?
The failure of the canal project will be the necessary
consequence of the success of their efforts, and they
mu^t be supposed to know what they are about.*'
It is to be noted that newspapers and Congressmen
who- have been known in the past to be in the service
of the transcontinental roads are vigorously fighting
the treaty, and there is no question but what they are
fighting the battle for the roads now, whether paiÂ«l
for it or not. A defeat of the treaty will seriously
complicate the situation and endanger the enterprise.
Neither of these forces is at this time making any
direct fight against the bill. They are taking advan
tage of the situation brought about by" the Hay-
Psunccfote treaty, and are fighting that. In a recent
debate in the Senate Morgan of Alabama said that
while he did not like the treaty he would vote for it
for the sake of getting the canal. Now there are a
good many others in the Senate who appear to be
opposed to the treaty mainly because of objection to
the canal for whose construction it provides.
DESPITE the cheering reports that come from
Washington concerning the prospects of the
Nicaragua canal bill, there are signs >ufticient
to make it evident that the opponents of the enter
prise have not yet lost hope of defeating it, or at least
postponing it. The opposition comes partly from the
transcontinental railroads and partly from the Panama
Canai Company, and each is strong enough to be
dangerous.
WILL BEAR WATCHING.
A DANGEROUS TENDENCY.
rOLLOWIXG the election of McKinley in 1896
there occurred in all parts of the United States
an immediate revival of industry and business.
Public confidence established by that victory
prompted the undertaking of enterprises in all lines
of industrial and commercial development, and the
nation went forward toward prosperity with some
thing of the rush of a river whose waters, long held
by the snow and ice of winter, break forth in free
dom on the return of spring.
The events of the past four years have justified that
confidence. All kinds of enterprises that were de
signed with prudence and managed with business
tact and skill have proven profitable. As a result the
people are now more confident than ever, and the re
election of McKinley has been again followed with
ar. -outburst of commercial energy. The question is
whether there may not be some danger of over
speculation resulting from the prevailing confidence.
Certain tendencies noted in New York render it im
perative for financiers to consider that phase of the
situation and beware lest they carry too far an activity
which if wisely conducted will vastly increase pros
perity, but if ill directed may bring ruin to thousands.
One of the more notable of these dangerous ten
dencies is that of organizing new companies with an
excessive capitalization. The New York Commer
cial in a recent review of the business of the country
said: "The record of new companies having a capi
talization of $1,000,000 or over for November shows
that the total capitalization amounted to $148,850,000,
as compared with $108,350,000 for the preceding
month. The total for the year up to December is
$2,217,550,000. The records for the past month,
however, do not indicate the real condition of the
industrial movement, for there are many companies
in process of formation which have not as yet filed
their incorporation papers and of which there is of
course no official record."
There is nothing on the face of the statement to
show that any of the new organizations and combi
nations of capital are bad in themselves, and it may
be that no one of them merits condemnation. It Is
the endrmous aggregate that constitutes the danger.
Most of the new companies â and probably all of
themâ will put more or less of their stock upon the
market for sale to 'the general public, and thus there
will be a strong incentive to speculation. Where the
companies have been over capitalized the. efforts of
the managers to make a showing of dividends as well
as to pay interest will lead to risky methods of doing
business, and as a result if any derangement occurs
in the great financial centers of the world, whether m
this or in some foreign country, there will be grave
danger of a collapse of many of the speculative or
ganizations, tending to produce a panic that in turn
will injure legitimate enterprises.
The menace is far greater for the East than for the
Pacific Coast. There have been no signs of an ab
normal increase in the number of new companies nor
of over capitalization on this side of the continent
Unless the development of the oil industry in this
State may be called a "boom," there is nothing cor
responding to the condition of affairs that prevails in
the East. The issue, therefore, is one we may study
impartially, and it certainly merits such study from
all who are largely" interested in financial and indus
trial affairs.
How's that for Congressional modesty,
Congressional Kngllsh and all the rest of
it? Can you beat It?
"While he was In the prison In 1S95 Pope
Leo XIII granted to his wife an annula

Catholic Bishop at Honolulu confirmed
this news, respectively. So Mr. Wilcox In
1896 married again to Princess Theresa
Owana Kaohelelanl, a direct descendant
of Keona, father of Kamehameha I. With
this matrimony Mr. Wilcox has a son and
a daughter living. ,^

gave a strict order to his bodyguard not

So much for Wilcox as a revolutionist.
Now. note the wind up:
p=rjp=^ HE richest thing in the way of au
| tobiography that has happened
9 this way for a long time is fur-
JLL nished through the Honolulu Ad
vertiser of recent date. It is the
life of Delegate-elect Robert W. Wilcox,
as written by himself for the Congres
sional directory. It is chiefly notable for
the childlike English of its composition
and the naivete with which the author
throws posies at his political self.
After reciting the ordinary incidents of
birth, education and first marriage. It con
tinues: "In September. 1887, Wilcox and
his bride left Italy for Hawaii. They both
stayed in Honolulu till 1888, when they
moved to San Francisco, and Mrs. Wilcox
gave birth to a daughter, whom they
named Vlttoria Colonna Wilcox. While
they were there Mr. Wilcox worked as
one of the surveyors of the engineers of
the Spring Valley Water Works Com
pany, while Mrs. Wilcox gave lessons oÂ£
French and Italian to young ladies, mak
ing the couple in better circumstances
than In Wllcox's native country."
At this stage of the proceedings things
happened this way:
"But Wilcox is strong-headed to return
to Honolulu and overthrow what the peo
ple of Hawaii called 'the bayoneted con
stitution and the reform government.' So
in 1S89 Mrs. Wilcox and their only beloved
daughter returned to Italy in the midst of
winter, while Mr. Wilcox returned to
Honolulu as a determined revolutionist.
"In -the morning of July 31, 1889, Mr.
Wilcox led a body of native revolutionists
and succeeded in occupying the ground of
the Molani palace (now the executive
HON. W. D. BLOXHAM, Governor of Florida,
in accepting . the invitation of the Board of
Trade of Brunswick, Ga., to be present at the
National Maritime Congress to be held there ,n' ext
month, says: "I heartily, indorse the object for
which this congress is called. The restoration of the
merchant marine of the United States to its former
prestige should .enlist the earnest support of every pa
triotic American. Your own words are timely, 'As the
first , ocean steamer , was built at and sailed from a
Georgian port, and the first shipyard in America was
established at a Florida port, it is fitting that this Na
tional Maritime Congress should assemble at a South
ern port.' " J - .
Hon. CD. Ogg, secretary of the Brunswick Board
of Trade, in his communication to the commercial
bodies of San Francisco asking them to send represen
tatives, says: "Let.us urge American ships for Amer
ican cargoes, hastening the time when American built
ships will be sold abroad, as are now other American
products which defy competition."
It is most fortunate that this progressive view is
taken in the South: The opponents of the bill now
before Congress advocate the "purchase of foreign
built ships for American register as a means of secur
ing a merchant marine. But others, who are far
sighted, desire to give an impulse to American ship
building, primarily to supply American ships for
American cargoes, and finally to build ships to sell
them to the world as we now manufacture and sell
other articles in which we defy competition.
There should not be any hesitation in choosing
between the two policies. We want to sell ships, and
not buy them. The development of ship-building will
follow the line along which our other industries have
developed. We began producing for the home market
and by wise protection have acquired such skill and
such economy in production that we supply the lar
gest external market enjoyed by any nation. The Pa
cific Coast has an impressive interest in this issu*.
We need a large merchant fleet in the Pacific Ocean,
and with proper encouragement can soon supply to
Japan, China and Australia the ships needed in their
trade, which we will finally be able to build cheaper
and better than any competitor.
San Francisco should send strong and intelligent
delegates to the Brunswick congress.
WE SHOULD SELL SHIPS.

Of its provisions or through doubtful interpretations
that have opened a wide door for wrongful entries.
It is aimed at the serial paper.-covered books, at the
private 'house organs,' at. the spurious trade journals
and sheets of an exclusive advertising character; at
bulk distribution, which is falsely called subscription,
and at the repeated turn and overturn by news agents
of unsold periodicals."
This country has acquired the respect of Europe by
its guidance of this settlement, and public opinion
here should continue to strongly back the administra
tion.
If the nations proceed on the pacific understand
ing. China will be finally admitted to a share in the
arbitration treaty which was framed in the Peace Con
ference at The Hague, and instead of continuing the
practice of a merely defensive diplomacy she will share
in that constructive and progress promoting diplo
macy which that treaty is intended to establish by less
ening the occasions for war.
The President's policy will establish that necessary
reciprocal relation in ?. mutuality of commerce. This
does not at all involve the swarming of Chinese labor
upon the other nations, but the enlargement of Chi
nese trade with them all.
It was observed by the keen and clear-headed
Marquis Tseng that the Western nations had not yet
understood that when they opened China to the world
they also opened the world to China.
If a settlement is finally made on the lines of Presi
dent McKinley's policy it will be a guarantee of the
future peace of China, and the progress of her people.
Though reached through violence and carnage, such
an understanding as it will establish will equalize the
results of breaking into the seclusion of that empire
and opening it to the worlcf.
The essence of the President's policy is to retire to
secondary place the theory of reprisal, punish the
guilty, and recoup the Western nations for their losses
by commercial advantages which will open the way for
trade far beyond the "present treaty ports. No nation
has a higher commercial instinct than China. The
Chinese merchant, wherever located, is noted for his
enterprise and his energy. To open his own country
more widely to the trade of the world is to broaden
his commercial opportunity. It is remarked that
no troubles are caused in that empire by the presence
of foreign merchants and foreign trade. These make
no zealous attempts to interfere with the religion or
the institutions of the country. 'They accept the na
tive administration of the laws, and are at one with
the native commercial classes.
THERE seems to be a normal and proper diplo
matic Reason for demanding that Li Hung
Chang and Prince Ching shall offer to the for
eign Ministers indisputable proof of their authority Jo
act for the Chinese Government. They present an
| edict received by telegraph. After the negotiation is
concluded, if its terms are not agreeable to the Gov
ernment, this telegram might be disavowed, and the
whole question would have to be taken up again. It is
daily more apparent that the peace of the world is in
volved in this Chinese settlement. Many of the allies
have views that are outside of their common cause
against China. Every day's delay in an adjustment
increases the danger of disagreement between the al
lies themselves. Chinese policy, if directed toward the
promotion of such disagreement, in the belief that
China will benefit thereby, is a mistake. When dogs
fight over a bone the bone gains nothing, for it is sure
to be gnawed in the end. It is to be hoped, therefore,
that Chang and Ching will equip themselves with a
proper warrant of authority. The matter of that au
thority, however, is not the first point to be settled.
This is the agreement of the allies themselves upon
the preliminary process, which will fix the scope of the
negotiation. President McKinley's, diplomacy has
won, and the powers, with the exception of England,
have instructed their Ministers to sign the agreement
which was framed at Washington. The enlightened
policy of the President has discarded the element of
revenge. It stands for just such treatment of China as
would be accorded to this country, or any European
nation placed in the same unfortunate condition. We
do not see this method in a sufficient perspective to
wholly appreciate its significance. When the affair
is over, and the world can judge of a settlement on the
President's plan by its results, it will be seen that
China has received the greatest impulse toward
progress and reform that has been given in all her his
tory. To preserve her self-respect, her territorial in
tegrity, her institutions and Government by treating
her as a. member of the family of nations is to make
her behave in the future as a member of that family
should.

TO ARRIVE.
A verb is often denned as a word used to
denote action, being, or state of being,
and for our present purpose this defin
ition will answer. Sometimes a verb is a
single word, as. "lions roar." Sometimes
it is a group of words denoting a single
action, as. "The light should have been
burning." â¢ . *
Among the most common blunders in
the use of words is that of confounding
the past tense and the past participle.
Perhaps the simplest way to explain the
nature of this blunder without going too
far into definitions and technicalities is
to say that the blunder consists in con
founding the forms of a verb that should
be used in filling the blanks In the follow
ing sentences: -
Present. Past. Past Participle.
I ânow I âyesterday I have
or It â now or It â yesterday or It was
If a per?on can Instantly Mil the above
blanks with the correct forms of, a given
verb he will not be likely to commit such
blunders as "1 seen him do it" -and "She
done it herself." Below la a list of some
forms often confounded or otherwise mis
used *
Begin, began, begun; blow, blew, blown:
break broke, broken; come, came, come;
do did done: drive, drove, driven; eat,
ate eaten; freeze, froze, frozen; forget,
forgot, forgotten; go, went, gone; rise,
rose, risen; see, saw, seen; speak, spoke,
spoken; steal, stole, stolen; take, took,
taken; write, wrote, written. ...
In using the words drink, vine, shrink,
Eing, sink, spring, swim, it is better to
confine the forms in "a" to the past tense,
and the forms in "u" to the past partici
ple; as "The bell rang five minutes ago";
"Yes. the bell has rung."
Gotten Is an old form of- "got" . still
used regularly In the compounds "begot
ten " "forgotten" and "ill-gotten." Some
c-ood speakers also use it instead of "got"
after "have," "was," etc.: but the prepon
derance of good usage is In favor of "got"
as the past participle of "got." It should
be remembered, however, that "I have
cot" means "I have- acquired," and that,
therefore. It should not be used when the
meaning is simply "I have."
Clothes are hung on a line; men are
hanped on a~ gallows. *
Proven as a past participle cf "prove" is
not used by the nest speakers and writers.
Therefore, following their example, wÂ©
should scy "The guilt of the prisoner
could not be proved."
Lie ("to recline"), lay ("to cause to lie"),
sit and set ("to put") are great stumbling
block? to many people. The following: sen
tences are correct := "Lie still": "Two men
lay under tho haystack all morning; they
must have lain there all night"; "He came
in and laid hi*' books on the table"; "After
r-e lay down he remembered that he had
left his pockÂ«tbook lying by the open win
dow" : He played until he was so tired
that he had to lie down'.'; "He had laid
himself at full' length on the graaa"; "I

XVUL HOW TO AVOID COMMON
. BLTTNDEBS. A ;
It will be found that the sum of the
areas of the squares on the sides Is equal
to the area of the square on the hypo
thenuse.. _ â , -'Â¦'*'Â¦
You must remember the following facts
about areas bf triangles, oblonga and par
allelograms: , -
1. A parallelogram is equal in area to
the oblong of the same length and height.
2. All parallelograms which have their
bases equal and have the same height are
equal in area.
3. A diagonal of a parallelogram divides
it Into two identical triangles. â¢
4. A triangle is equal to half an oblong
on thÂ« same base and of the same height.
5. All triangles which have their bases
equal and have also the same height are
equal in area.
General Bule.
The square on the hypothenuse Is equal
to the sum of the squares on the sides
containing the right angle.
The square of a number is the product
of tho number multiplied by itself. The
square root of a number is that smaller
number which multiplied by Itself will
give that number. Thus, 25 Is the square
of 6; 4 is the square root of 16.
Exercises.
J The sides forming the right angle of
a right triangle are 6 inches and 8 Inches.
Find the length of the other side.
Noteâ Square 6 and square 8; add to

Ali the bodies the Hancock had taken
from Honolulu and Guam had been trans
ferred at Manila, and when she left the
Philippines she was a "clean ship," save
for the sick aboard. At Nagasaki the re

death. : .
The Hancock came in with all her flags
at half-mast and was promptly quaran
tined. About 4 p. m. she was released
and two hours later the cabin passengers
came ashore.
Among those who came up on the Han
cock was Captain Devereux Shields. Ho
was captured by the Filipinos and nearly
killed. He still bears the marks of the
bolos and says he never wants to spend
another month and a half among the in
surgents. . Â¦ l Y- 'V--','
Arrival of the Hathor.
The Kosmos liner Hathor arrived from
Antwerp via South and Central American
ports yesterday. Owing: to the fact that
the Sierra was on one side of, Pacific-
Street wharf and the Alden Besse on the
other she could not dock in her old berth
and had to go to Lombard street. To
morrow when the Sierra sails there will
be room for her and she will move there

San Diego on her way here and all tho

Trouble, in the Mandalay.
There was a strike on the steam
schooner Mandalay last Sunday.- The
union men struck for higher wages and
Captain Reid refused to acede to their de
mand. Later the men walked off and the
captain got up steam and anchored- off
Vallejo-street wharf. Then he went
ashore and ; secured a non-union crew.
At a late hour the Mandalay went to sea
and the union now promises to make trou

Or suppose that Mr. Gould wishes to ac
cept the Invitation. Shall he then writ*
as follows?
"'Mr. Gould wilt be happy to accept Mrs.
Black's kind Invitation for Thurs'dar."
Certainly not; for when will he be nappy
to accept? Is he writing a note now to
say that he means to accent at some fu
ture time, and that when he does accept
he will feel happy? Or doea he mean this
note to be an acceptance? If he doea,
then he is happy now, and he should Â§ay:
"Mr. Gould accepts with pleasure (or. Is
happy to accept) Mrs. Black's kind Invita
tion for Thursday."
"Mr. Gould regrets that he la unable to
accept Mrs. Black's kind Invitation, as he
expects to be absent from the city on
Thursday.",
In this note Mr. Gould means to say
that absence from the city "next Thurs
day" will prevent him from being present
at Mrs. Black's entertainment, and that
therefore he la now compelled to decline
the Invitation. Mrs. Black's entertain
ment and Mr. Gould's absence from the
city are Indeed things of the future, prop
erly referred to by the future tense; but
Mr. Gould's acceptance or declination of
the invitation is a fact of the present,
and therefore in his note he should have
said something like this:
Present facta and unchangeable truths.
however, should be expressed In the pres
ent tense, regardless of the tense of the
main verb, as, "What did you say bis
name is?***
3. The perfect Infinitive, "To have seen,"
"to have hurt." etc., is properly used to
denote action which is completed at the
time denoted by the main verb, aar "I am
glad to have Been Niagara Falls/' "He
felt sorry to have hurt your feelings."
This principle la violated In the following
Incorrect sentences: "I Intended to have
done it yesterday." (The doing wa* not
completed at the time of the Intending.)
"It was the policeman's duty to have ar
rested the thief."" (The arrest had not
been made at the time referred to by "It
was the policeman's duty.") The sen
tences should read: "I intended to do it
yesterday." "It was the policeman's duty
to arrest the thief."
Notes accepting or declining Invitations
often show a wrong use of the future
tense. For example, the following note Is
Incorrect: .
"Mr. Gould regrets that absence from
the city will prevent him from accepting
Mrs. Black's kind invitation for next
Thursday."
I know he would come.
I have taken the first train, that Z may
arrive early.
I had taken the first train, that I might
arrive early.
Blanche will be frightened if she sees
the bat. â¢
Blanche would be frightened If shÂ» saw
the bat.
Blanche would have been frightened if
she had seen the bat.
I knew he would come.
5. When one or more plural words coma
between a singular subject and Its verb a
writer is in danger of forgetting- the real
subject and of piving to the verb the num
ber of the nearest substantive. The fol
lowing sentences are correct: "The forma
tion of paragraphs Is very important."
(Here the subject la "formation.")
"Every one of us has had this feeling."
(Here the subject is "every one.")
Some writers hold that in careful writ
ing contracted forms should be avoided,
but all are agreed that in conversation
some contractions, if correctly used, are
natural and proper. The conversation of
a. person who never said "can't" for "can
not," "don't" tor "do not" or "doesn't"
for "does not" 'would seem stiff, i Cars
should, however, be taken not to use plu
ral contractions for singular, or singular
for plural. "Don't" Is a contraction of "do
not," "doesn't" of "does not"; therefore
the following sentences are correct: ""Why
doesn't she come?" "Why don't they
come?" The proper contraction of "is
not" is "isn't," of "are not" "aren't."
"Daresn't." if used at ail. should be used
only when "dares not" might be substi
tuted. "Ain't" Is never proper under any
circumstances.
Among the most perplexing questions
connected with the proper use of verbs
are those which have to do with the
choice of the proper tense or time form.
In general the tense of a verb should cor
rectly express the time referred to. The
following principles are established by
good usage:
L Verbs xeferring to the same tlmo
should be in the same tense. The princi
ple is violated in the following sentences:
"It was a superstition among the Mexi
cans that a bullet will not kill a man un
less it has his name stamped on It";
"Soon after Oliver reached home a serv
ant announces the presence of Oliver'*:
"If you would only wait, your success
will be certain."
2. The tense of the verb in a dependent
clause varies with the tense of the main
verb, as:
3. When subjects connected by "or" or
"nor" are of different numbers, the verb
usually agrees with the nearest; as, "Ona
or two were there."
4. Words joined to a singular subject by
"with," "together with," "in addition to
or "as well as." are not on the same
grammatical level as the subject, but are
parenthetical, and therefore do not affect
the number of the verb; as, "Justice, as
well as mercy, allows it."
1. The pronoun "you" takes a plural
verb even when its meaning is singular;
as, "Tom, you were late."
2. A collective noun In the singular num
ber takes a singular verb when the collec
tion is viewed as a whole; a plural verb
when the members of the collection arÂ«
thought of as individuals; as, "The com
mittee was discharged." (Here the com
mittee Is thought of as a body.) "The
committee were eating dinner." (The com
mittee ate, not as a body, but as separate
individuals.)
The principle that a verb agrees with Its
subject in number is in most cases fol
lowed unconsciously. A few instructions,
however, require special notice:
Bread and butter Is good enough for
me. (Two singular subjects taken togeth
er as one thing; singular verb.)
Neither Fred nor hla sister was there.
(Two sinerular subjects considered sepa
rately; singular verb.)
You observe that, in general, a singular
form of the verb is used when the subject
is singular or regarded as singular; a>
plural form when the subject is plural or
regarded as plural.
"Gulliver's Travels" was written by
Swift. (Subject plural In form, but sin
gular in sense, denoting a single book;
singular verb.)
Tom and his sister were there. (Two sin
gular subjects, together forming a plural;
plural verb.)
have lain down and I feet rented"; **I lay
doTvn an hour a^o to take a nap"; "When
Romeo saw Juliet lying In the caaket, ha
lay down by her side and drank the
poison. When Juliet awoke, seeing Romeo
lying beslJe her dead, she took a sword
Â¦which lay near and killed herself."
Many blunders In the use of verbs have
to do with what is called "the agreement
of a verb with its subject." In the case
of the verb "to be" the form of the verb
varies greatly, according to the person
and number of the subject, as. "I am."
"thou art." "he, she or it is." "we or they
are," "I was." "you were," "they were."
In the case of other verbs the only varia
tion for number and person In common
use is the addition of "s" to the verb
when the subject is in the third person
singular, as. "the Sun sets." This 13 called
the singular or "s" form of the verb.
Now examine the verbs and their sub
jects in the following sentences:
A sense of duty pursues us ever. (Sin
gular subject; singular verb.)
Troubles never come singly. (Plural
subject; plural verb.)
Half of them are gone. (Subject singu
lar in form, but plural in sense; plural
verb.)

NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â It has been many
months since fluctuations on the New York
Cotton Exchange have reached 50 points and
since speculation has equaled that recorded
to-day. From opening to closing the session
was one of great interest. The market opened
peaceably enough, with prices 3 points higher
to 5 points lower and easier In tone. A pause
lor bearings and then a drop of some 10 to 12
points occurred under room and outside sell
ing, precipitated by surprisingly large receipts
and gloomy Knglish market new*. Then came
a sharp reaction, which carried prlcea up with
a rush 14 to 17 points on fresh rumors that
the bureau report was cut through a leak and
was strongly bullish. 8 The close of the first
hour saw the market decidedly , steady and a
shade above Saturday's closing figures. For
the next half-hour unimportant variations oc
curred and buslne*s became quite sluggish. A
scamper for safer ground resulted in feverish
trading and an erratic movement in values,
though at 12 o'clock prices were nearly even
u ith the closing of Saturday. . The bureau
report came over the | wire promptly and esti
mated the present crop at 10,100,000 bales. from
an acreage of 25,034,734. Terrific selling Im
mediately *et in and amid unprecedented ex
citement prices fell vertically 40 to 60 points
there being individual declines of 5 to 20 points
at a time before the crush was over. Stop
lcÂ«Â» orders added to the confusion. The enor
mous profits within *.ary reach tempted shorts,
to cover and soon a rally was in progress
which steadied the market 12 to 15 points For
the rest of the day the market was lrregulir
and subject to violent fluctuations and spa* ma
of buying and selling. At the close the mar
ket was steady, with prices 27 to 33 points
lower.

Provisions were fairly active and strong
early on light hog receipts and an outside de
mand for pork and ribs. This demand, how
ever, was soon Ratlstieil and prices eased oft
some, but held part of the advance bÂ«caupe of
light offerings. January pork closed lOo higher,
lard 5c higher and ribs a shade up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
The oats market was flat, furnishing only a
few scalping operations. May closed %c down
at 23%c.
Corn was moderately active and generally
weak, declining early and showing but little
tendency toward recovery. May closed %c
lower at 36c. December closed %c lower at
36%c. t
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.â Wheat was a moderately
active market. Speculators were swayed by
contiictlne emotions and in consequenoe prices
cut a somewhat irregrular path. May, in which
the best trade now centers, opened %c under
Saturday at 73%Â©73c, and during the first half
hour declined to 72%c. The crowd was in a
majority of cases short, but not worrying about
it, although Liverpool showed great steadiness
in the face of Saturday's slump here. World's
shipments last week were 6,024,000 bushels,
about what had been expected. The amount on

ishness, however, was due largely to the ex
pectation that the visible supply would show,
no particular decrease and possibly an in
crease to liberal Northwest reports and to the
leek of outside support, which has depressed
prices here recently. Later in the day when
it was shown that the visible had decreased
655,000 bushels, the previous confidant shorts be
gran covering and May was bid up sharply to
73iic. On the bulge longs sought to secure
profits, but on lack of outside support prices
sagged. May closing barely steady. %@%c lower
at 73c.

the- American department, which haa been so
active recently, excitement Is wanting. Dull

ferred shares of Erie, which was In demand.

STTLL IN THE COURTS
Supreme Court Grants a New Trial
to Two Defendants in the
Action.
The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday partly reversing the
judgment of the lower court in the now
famous suit of the city and county of
San Francisco against. John Center and
other residents, who were Interested In
the property known as Mission Creek.
The city was successful in the lower
court, but two of the defendants, Georges,
and Eugene Le Roy, appealed and they
were successful.
The city filed suit on November 29. 18S6,
to recover possession of the strip of land
extending ' from Ninth to Eighteenth
streets, which was formerly known as
Mission Creek. Among the defendants,
of whom there were a large number, were
Georges and Eugene Le Roy, who claimed
ownership in and possession of the land
in question. Judgment was given against
the Le Roys, except as to a small stzed
tract about 25 feet square, which is situ
ated at the southeast corner of Alameda
and Columbia streets. From that portion
of the judgment in favor of the city the
Le Roys appealed.
The opinion rendered is a lengthy one
and deals with the testimony offered at
the hearing In the lower court. In grant
ing the new trial the court said:
"For the reasons given in the foregoing
opinion the Judgment and order are re
versed and a new trial ordered as to ap
pellants, to be had upon the evidence al
ready taken and such other evidence as
plaintiff or appellants or either of them
may wish to offer, and as to all other de
fendants the judgment is affirmed."
Darby Laydon Convicted.
Darby Laydon, contractor, was con
victed yesterday by a jury in the United
States District Court of having- violated
the' Federal "statute prohibiting the em
ployment ef workingmen for more than
eight hours per day on Government work.

Independent contractor, and did not corao
within the provisions of the statute, but
Judge de Haven -denied the motion, Lay
don committed the offense while work-

MARCUS DALY'S WILL
MAY BE CONTESTED
Was a Brother of the Montana
Inmate of Soldiers' Home Says He
Millionaire.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â While an amica
ble agreement has been entered Into by
the beneficiaries under the will of the late
Marcus Daly which is satisfactory to all.
it Is firmly believed by those most inter
ested that a contest of the will is certain.
Alleged relatives of the late copper king
are appearing in various sections of the
country, and all are casting envious eyes
on the millions sqon to be distributed.
Unless an unexpected delay occurs the
will left by Marcus Daly will be filed in
Montana Wednesday. At the same time
letters of ancillary administration will be
applied for here and the estate will be
managed from this city.
It was impossible to-day to obtain any
exact information concerning the amount
of the Daly fortune, but from a man who
has for years been on terms of intimate
friendship with Daly, Clark and Haggin n
was learned that from $15,000,000 to $18,000.
000 would bo turned over to the benefici
aries. This Is about $3,000,000 less than
Mr. Daly was reputed to be worth before
his death.
Rev. Peter Daly, now an inmate of the
Soldiers' Home In Hot Springs. S. D., will
probably begin a contest. It Is said that
he only recently learned that he was a
brother of Marcus Daly. The knowledge
came to him while reading a biography
of Marcus Daly published In connection
with a death notice. He knew that he
had a brother Marcus, but they had sep
arated when boys in Ireland and had lost
all track of each other.
Peter Daly had often heard of the won
derful wealth of Marcus Daly of Mon
tana, but had never for an Instant sup
posed that his brother Marcus was the
modern Croesus.
Peter Daly during his* active careor
served as pastor of three Methodist
churches In this State.

WRECKAGE PICKED UP
OFF CARMANAH LIGHT
Portion, of the Name-Board of Some
Luckless Vessel Found at
Sea.
VICTORIA. Dec. 10.â News was brought
by the steamer Queen City, which returned
from the west coast this afternoon, of the
finding of a quantity of wreckage at Car
manah by "W. Daykln. the . lighthouse
keeper at Carmanah light.' The wreckage
consists of the broken piece of a name
board with the letters and flg-ures "A L
62." evidently the end of the name of the
craft from which It had come. The board
was painted, red and, the letters were yel
low. , A great quantity of small tongned
and grooved lumber painted white was
found, evidently part of the housework of
some vessel; a piece of the gunwale of a
boat, several oars, -a great many empty
cases and four lffe belts marked "S. S.
San Pedro." . ' . - ' "
As the st earner* Snn Pedro was several
years ago blown up from where she lay
for years on Brotchle Ledge by T. P.
"Whitelaw of San Francisco, the life belta
must have been sold to the craft which
lost them.
The weather has been very good of late
up the coast, and no word of other wreck
age has been heard from the length of the
Island coast. /No vessel is mloslng with
the exception of the ship Gertrude, which
sailed from Portland some time ai?o and
bumping on the bar, began to leak to a
considerable extent. She was reported
making for the Sound, and tugs have been
looking for her off the entrance to the
straits for a week without avail. There is
however, nothing in the wreckage to iden
tify it: with 'that vessel, and nothing can
be learned whatever to indicate whence it
came. ' '*;

Ex-residents of the State of Missouri
enjoyed a pleasant reunion last evening
In the parlors of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association, the occasion being the
regular monthly meeting of tho Missouri
Society of California. The president.
Judge E. A. Bridgfcrd, welcomed all who
were present and was followed by the
Hon. Tlrey L. Ford, who spoke in place
of ex-Lieutenant Governor Jeter, who was
to have addressed the society. General
Ford made a most telling speech and
dwelt on the many glories of the State
of Missouri; the great men she had given
to the world and the virtues learned by
the firesides of the homes in the old
State. He closed his address with a trib
ute to the State of California, the adopted
home of his auditors. A musical pro
gramme was rendered by Professor Lucy,
Miss Tooley. Miss Riley, Mrs. Breedlove,
Mrs. Amrath, Messrs. Larsen, Williams
and others.
Just before the meeting closed the pres
ident announced that Mrs. Farris of Sac
ramento, a member of' the society, had
received a letter from a son of Missouri,
Mark Twain, and the reading of it called
forth loud applause. The letter was as
follows:
14 "West Tenth street,
NEW YORK CITY. Nov. 26, 1900.
IV-ar Mrs. Farris: My wife and I answer
all my correspondents with the pen and have
no secretarial help. Last nlKht we wrote and
mailed twenty-one letters apiece. You will
guess that they were not long ones. We have
to make them short or we should not get
through. This one will have to be brief, too.
If I had the time I could say much, but lack
lntj It, I can only say a couple of words and
wish you and the society all prosperity and
happiness. Sincerely yours,

"I believe in inviting this litigation to

Reed's motion to refer to the City At
torney was defeated Â¦ by the following
vote:
Brandenstein said Curry had not in
sisted on prepayment for the paper, and
had, therefore, waived his right to pre
payment.
"We have no moral right to approve
that demand when we know that the
charge for the paper is in excess of Its
market value," said Brandenstein.
"If the demand is dishonest and we
know it is a steal, why should we pay
it?" pointedly asked Stafford.
"We will suppose it in a steal." said
Reed, "but the holding of an election is
a sovereign. State matter, und v.e aro
simply inviting a suit by rejecting the de
mand. The Secretary of State could have
demanded prepayment, but he did not. I
move that the question be referred to the
City Attorney to determine whether this
board has the power to reject this de
mand."
"The committee." said Reed, "has found
after due Investigation that the charge for
the ballot paper was double what It ought
to be. I do not question the propriety of
the Mayor's course in having vetoed the
demand, nor that of the Judiciary Com
mittee in having recommended its reject
ment. I contend that it is a question for
the Legislature to decide, however, and
this board has no authority in the mat
ter."
Reed took the ground that the demand
was valid Â«and the board had no jurisdic
tion to reject it under the terms of the
Political Code.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday sus
tained the Mayor's veto of Secretary of
State Curry's demand of $725 for ballot
paper furnished to this city for the last
election. The reason assigned for the
vetp was that the charge of $2 50 per ream,
or 12Vfc cents per pound, was exorbitant.
The Judiciary Committee recommended
that the Mayor's veto be sustained after
It had made an exhaustive investigation,
in which several paper experts testified.
The committee found that the market
value of the paper at the time it was
furnished was only 6 cents per pound, and
on that showing agreed that the demand
should be cut exactly in half.

PAPER DEMAND
The $25,000 verdict for breach of 'promise
recently secured by Jane Hodge against
Capitalist John Nicholl was set aside to
day by Judge Ogden on the ground that
the plaintiff did not deny the testimony of
the defendant that she had released him
from his promise on learning of thÂ«Â» oppo
sition of his daughters to the marriage.
The court sums up the arguments sub
mitted by the defendant In moving for a
new trial under four heads: First, that
the award is excesMve; second, that the
offer of marriage wns conditional upon
tho assent of the daughters, Mary and
Hester; third, that defendant wns not
competent to contract marriage; fourth,
that the plaintiff had released the defend
ant from his promise to marry her.
On the first threo counts the verdict of
the Jury is sustained. But the court holds
that the denial ihaf the promise of mar
riage wps conditional does not affect the
unrebutted testimony of Nicfioll and his
daughters that Mips Hodge agreed to
"call it all off" because the girls. were
"making a fuss" over the prospective
match.
In her complaint against the aged cap
italist Miss Hodge demanded $50,000 dam
ages. The suit was blterly contested and
created a sensation at the time of the
hearing. The parties to the suit are well

The ordinance submitted by the Police
department making; it unlawful for any
person to have in his possession so-called
"knockout drops" or any mixture which,

Supervisor McCarthy introduced a reso
lution, which was referred to the Judici
ary Commitee, providing for the establish
ment of a public pound so as to take in
the city limits according to the provisions
of the charter. McCarthy stated that he
presented the resolution at the request of
the University Mound Improvement Club.
Reed urged the passage of the resolu
tion on the ground that by the release of
the original $123,000 every dollar of the
city's obligations would be paid.
"To pay our debts would bo a justifica
tion for the passage of this ordinance,"
fcaid Reed. "Our dottcit will be wiped out
and this Is the only way :t can be done."
The vote on the hnal adoption of the or
dinance was as follows, the ten votes nec

"The board cannot legally pass this or
dinance," said ISrandenstein, in objecting
to its passage. "We cannot pledge tftir
selves to appropriate the additional $50,
000. Thert; has been no rea3on advanced
for establishing this park except the l;iek
cf police surveillance in the district. The
matter shou'.d be submitted to a vote of
the people first."
."McCarthy objected to using the money
cf taxpayers to build the park and argued
that it would cost $300,000 or more to buy
the land alone.
The ordinance providing funds for the
acquisition of land for St. Mary's Park
was finally passed yesterday by the
Board of Supervisors. In addition to re
leasing the $125,000 originally appropriated
for the park and now tied up in the city
treasury, the ordinance sets apart the
sum of <50,000 out of available lunds of
this fiscal year for the purchase of the
land. It also pledges the board to appro
priate Â£0.w0 more during the next ilscal
year for the same purpose.
McCarthy objected to the passage of the
ordinance anu desired to know when the
$12d,uw originally appropriated for the'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1900.
THE MAN WHO MOVED HIS
HOUSE BODILY BECAUSE OF
NOISE.
Hardin, a local contractor, resid
ing at 1S05 Sherman street, has picked up
his abode and moved to the other ex
tremity of his lot. Several times Hardin
has sought to have the fist of the law
poked in the face of his noisy neighbor,
but he has never been able to accomplish
anything. So he decided that, as distance
lends enchantment, he would put a's much
distance between himself and the other
man as his limited area of real estate
would permit. He moved his house thirty
feet, and says that It will cost him $200
before he gets through with the Job.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 10.â Because he
could riot sleep well or at all,
nights, owing to the boisterous'
hilarity of his neighbors, J. T.
Mr. Hardin is a peace-loving, law-abid
ing citizen and a family man. He is the
proud father of four children. Occasion
ally he affiliates with the Salvation Army,
singing halMuJahs on the thoroughfares.
If there is anything he can't stand It 13
any unseemly noise, especially the species
of noise that la superinduced by the winÂ©
that Is red.
Next door to Mr. Ha; din lives Domingo
Pessa. He has a large family. As his
name suggests, he is .-Â» son of Italy. H*Â»
makes a living by selling vegetables six
days in the week. On the seventh day
he likes to have a sooo time. He is as
fond of the music of the accordion and a
beaken of grape juice as his neighbor 13
of the Salvation Army. And Pessa is pop
ular among his countrymen. Sometimes
he has the whole Italian colony over for
dinner of a Sunday. Then they have a
great time. After dinner they "rolla da
ball." in the smooth back yard, accom
pany the accordion with their melodious
voices, and punish sundry "bots." In
short, they eat. drink and are merry.
Naturally these reunions are very dis
tasteful to a man like Mr. Hardin. who
remembers the Sabbath Day and keeps
It holy. Then they nave a tendency to
keep himself and family awake. Until he
moved his house it was quite close to that:
of the Pessas so that every sound could
be heard. Remonstrances. Mr. Hariln
found, were of no avail. He tried, the law.
and twice had Pessa arrested for disturb
ing the peace. But it did him no good,
for each time the defendant was on hand
with a lot of witnesses who could testify
to his good character as a citizen, and
Justice Morris would dismiss the case.
"It seemed to me that the only relief
could be got by moving my house." said
Mr. Hardin. as he was laying the new
brick foundation to-day. "Those Italians
kicked up such a rumpus that It was im
possible to sleep. This fellow Pessa
bought a lot of new wtne this summer
and he invites his friends over every Sun
day to help him get rii of it. It must
set them on fire like, for they holler like
Indians on the warpath. They've got
barrels of the stuff in the cellar now.
"Yes. sir, thr simplest way out of !t
was to move. It's cost me $200 to do It.
but I don't care for that. I've got as far
away from their place as T can get. After
I get mr foundation fixed I'm going to
build a fence fifteen feet high and grow
grapevines on it to keep as much noise
out as possible."
The home of the Pessa;" is somewhat
lacking in its appointments and It Is a
brave mnn who will venture Into it*
depths. The talking Is done with the In
mates from a safÂ» distance.
"Datta man nex* d^or. he much da
cranka." explained Mr. Pessa. when asked
to tell *bout his trouble with Hardin.
"No raaka so mucha da nofÂ«ie he can no
sleep. He no Ilka da wine, datta all."

Not Like Italian Manner of Entertaining.
MOVES HIS HOUSE
TO ESCAPE THE DIN
The court-martial of Captain Nieppert,
the National Guard officer accused of
making: a false parade report, was inaug
urated at: the Page-street Armory laat
night before Captain V. A. Smith, adju
tant of the Fifth , Regiment. The testi
mony given by members of his own com
pany was adverse to the accused man,
whose only hope ils now, according to his
brother officers, to escape being cashiered
Attorney, Z. U. Dodge represented Niep
pert. The case was put over until to
night to give the judge advocate time in
which to read the testimony. ; Â¦â¢

the Lafayette School some time on Sun
day nlpM and created general havoc In
the classrooms. Doorknobs were wrenched
off, windows smashed, clocks broken
books stolen, desks cut and the black
boards scribbled I over. So bad was the
damag-e that In some of the classrooms no
recitations were held yesterday. Truant
Officer Floyd is conducting an investiga

the Decision 'of the Court of
Claims.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â The United
States Suprerhe Court to-day rendered an
opinion In the claim of the Wichita, Choc
taw and Chickasaw Indians in connection
with the old Wichita reservation. Justice
Harlan handing down the opinion. In 1S81
the Indians made a treaty with the United
States Government ceding the Wichita
reservation and agreeing to take 160 acres
in severalty. They then claimed they were
entitied to the proceedB of the sale of the
surplus land. â¢ The Court of Claims sus
tained the contention of the Indians, but
to-day's opinion reverses that opinion, the
Supreme Court holding that in the treaty
of 1861 the Choctaws had made an abso
lute session of the lands included in the
reservation. " .
The court also remanded the case to
the Court of Claims with the direction to
dismiss the claims of the Choctaws and
the Chickasaws. and to fix such compen
sation to the Wichita- as is consistent
with law. The reservation 1 is a part of
the old lease district of 7.500,000 acres, ly
ing between the Red River and the Cana
dian River and the ninety-eighth and
one hundredth degrees of west longitude.

Charles A. Towne Takes Oath of Of

Senate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.-1 ne first of
He denied .that such government could
be Justified under the war power, as the
war power has no existence except in
time of war, when the war is authorized
by Congress, and that the President could
not use the national forces for the pur
pose of governing Cuba. He relied espe
cially upon the case of ex parte Mllllgan.
He argued finally that. In any event.' as
the trial in the Cuban courts is without
a grand Jury or a petit Jury. 'Neely could
not be tried before them without a viola
tion of the sixth, seventh and eighth
amendments to the constitution.
John D. Lindsay of the New York bar
opened the argument for Neely. He
claimed that there existed Jn Cuba prior
to our intervention a . Cuban republic.
This republic, he argued, the United
States recognized on April 20. 1S0S, when
It passed a Joint resolution signed by the
President which declared that "the people
of the island of Cuba are and of right
ought to be free and independent." He
claimed that the United States did not
make war against the Cuban republic
thus recognized, but was its ally, and that
therefore the success of the American
army did not mean that Cuba was con
quered, but that thÂ«> Spanish troops werÂ«
driven -out of the territory of a friendly
ally. He contended, therefore, that wheu
the treaty of Paris was ratified the war
ceased, and as no war had been declared
against the Cuban republic all further
Justification under the war making power
to occupy Cuba ceased, and the President
should Immediately upon the ratification
of the treaty or within a reasonable time
thereafter have withdrawn the army. He
claimed, therefore, that the institution
and maintenance by the President of a
military government In Cuba was and Is
without authority under international law
and in flagrant; contravention of the con
stitution of the United States. He fur
ther urged that such military government
was unconstitutional, as It was essen
tially a prosecution of war against the
Cuban republic, and as Congress alone
had the authority to declare war against
the Cuban republic the control of Cuba
by the President as commander in chief
was a virtual prosecution of war with
out the authority of Congress.
The latter feature of the argument made
it the first of the arguments which bring
up for final decision by the Supreme Court
the constitutional relations between this
country and the territorial acquisitions
which it has gained as a result of the
Spanish-American war. The Xeely case
referred exclusively to the character of
these relations so far as the island of
Cuba was concerned, and thus presented
an independent question from that which
will be argued on December 17, when the
character of these relations with Porto
Rico and the Philippines will be under
consideration.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â The Neely ex
tradition case was argued in the Supreme
Court.. All the Judges were present. The
argument developed interesting and im
portant questions of law [with reference
to the right of the United States to ex
tradite a fugitive criminal in the absence
of an extradition treatv, and ..especially
with reference to the right of the Presi
dent since the ratification of the treaty
of Paris to maintain a military form o"f
government in the island of Cuba.

LINDSAY SPEAKS
IN NEELY CASE
In 1804 Rhode Island College was the
only school conducted by American Bap
tists and It was in that year that the
name of the institution was changed to
Brown University. : To-day there are
about 200 Baptist Institutions of all grades
in North America, almost fifty of which
were organized in the years between 1880
and 1890. many of them being schools for
the colored people and Indians.: *At Â¦ the
beginning of the present century the total
value of Baptist school property did not
exceed $50,000, i in I860 the total had - in
creased to $2,000,00% and now, at the close
of the century,, the value of school prop
erty Is fully $44,000,000. About one-half
of this sum Is In grounds, buildings and
equipment and about one-half in endow
ments. At the beginning of the century
there .were in Rhode Island College
ninety-two students;' there. are now in
schools and colleges fully 40,000 students.
According to latest reports the total
value of Baptist" church property In the
United States is $86,648,982, and the total
annual expenditure of the denomination
in this country is $12,348,527, the principal
items of which are: Church expenses,
$9,622,066; Sunday school expenses, $502,231;
home missions, $319.C25; foreign missions,
$402,016. and education, $179,207. This last
item does not give an adequate idea of
the Importance of the educational work
carried on in this country under Baptist
auspices because it does not include. the
sums that are raisad directly by the edu
cational institutions. The growth of the
educational work of the denomination in
the nineteenth century has been fully as
marked as has been the growth of the
denomination itself. â¢ . â¢ .. ,
The Baptist church is not so strong
abroad as it is in this country. In, all of
Europe there are 3739 churches, with 460,
261 members, and 2tRÂ»7 of these churches
and 355,218 of the members are in Great
Britain and Ireland. In Asia there are
1602 churches, with 113,745 members. Africa
has 111 churches and C700 members, while
Australasia is represented in the denom
ination by 236 churches and 10,261 mem
bers. ;
When Roger Williams was driven out of
Massachusetts because, among other
things; he had changed his religious views
and had reached the conviction that im
mersion was essential to a proper profes
sion of Christianity, a conviction so strong
that, as is told in the old story, he and
another man immersed each other and
thereby established the Baptist church In
this country, he started a religious move
ment that, at the beginning of the nine
teenth century, had grown until it num
bered about 1200 churches with 100,000
members. In the century just about to
close the growth of "the denomination has
been constant and there are now in the
United States 43,427 churches, with a total
membership of 4.181.CS6. The membership
Increased 40,000 last year. - A large pro
portion of the churches of the denomina
tion are in the Southern States, but every
State and Territory of the Union hat a
number of the churches. . .
We are summoned to this advance by the
wonderful blesslntr of God upon our efforts
hitherto; by the temporal 'prosperity now ac
corded us; by the great opportunities In our
mission fields at home and abroad, and by the
supreme obligation to obey our Lord's com
mand to evangelize the world. "Ye shall re
ceive power after that the Holy Ghost is come
upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me
both lii Jerusalem and in air Judea and in
Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the
earth."
That the beginning of the twentieth century
should be signalized by a pronounced advance
in all our missionary operations; and that for
this purpose It Is recommended that Individ
uals and churches increase their offerings 50
per cent above the usual sums; and that spe
cial effort be made to secure an offering from
every member of every Baptist church, with a
view to Increasing the aggregate yearly con
tributions of our churches for missions to at
least 11.000,000.
It la also recommended that these associa
tions and conventions appropriately observe the
beginning 'of the new century, so far as prac
ticable. In accordance with the spirit and
scope of the suggestions hecein presented.
That more attention be given in our churches
to the observance of the monthly concert of
prayer for missions at home and abroad: es
pecially that In the first week In May there
shall be untted supplication for the divine
blessing upon the approaching annual convo
cations of our great missionary organizations,
as also upon the meetings of all Baptist as
sociations and conventions throughout our land.
That on the third Sunday In April the pas
tors of our churches preach on our denomina
tional progress and achievements during the
last cc-ntury, and our present opportunities and
obligations; and that editors of our religious
Journals about the same time give special prom
inence to these matters.
Inasmuch aa our 200 academies, colleges, uni
versities and theological seminaries, with more
than 2000 instructors and about 40.000 pupils and
a material equipment valued at about $45,000,000,
are potent factor? in the development of de
nominational life and power, It Is recommended
that the day of prayer for colleges, the fourth
Thursday in January, 1901, be devoutly ob
served by all our institutions of learning; that
theee institutions be specially remembered by
our churches at their regular prayer meetings
In the tame week; that the editors of our re
ligious journals devote particular attention to
our educational interests in their Issues for that
week; and that this be the theme of discourses
by pastors on the last Sunday In 'January.
That with the opening of the twentieth cen
tury concerted and simultaneous effort be
made throughout the denomination for the
quickening of the spiritual life and activities
of our churches, particularly for the salvation
of the unconverted in their own localities. As
preparatory to the week of prayer, It Is sug
gested that on the first or the second day of
the new century the pastors in every Baptist
association, at the call of the moderator there
of, hold an all day meeting for prayer and con
ference on this subject. Â«
The statement of the committee calls
attention, first, to the fact that it is tho
purpose of the committee to recommend
that the spiritual element in the proposed
commemoration of the beginning of the
new century be made paramount. "The
supreme need of the hour," says the com
mittee, "is a refreshing from on high. In
this secularized age our lord's message,
'Seek ye first the kingdom' of God and his
righteousness and all these things shall
be added unto you,' needs fresh considera
tion." Financial features of the com
memoration will, therefore, be subordi
nated to the spiritual. The committee
feels that it would be unwise to under
take to raise by extraordinary means a
large sum of money for special purposes,
and that the greatest permanent good can
be accomplished if the commemoration
services held in all the Baptist churches
of the country can be of such a spiritual
character as to promote a spirit of con
secration and stimulate the people of the
church to more generous offerings for all
of the great missionary causes of the de
nomination. The recommendations of
the committee follow:
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â At the Baptist
National Anniversaries, which was held
in Detroit, the three national Baptist so
cieties, the Home Mission Society, j the
Publication Society and the Missionary
Union, adopted resolutions appointing a
committee of seven men from each so
ciety to devise and â¢ formulate a method
whereby the Baptist people of the United
States might most suitably commemorate
the beginning of the twentieth century of
the Christian era. The Rev. Dr. Lemuel
Moss, president of the American Baptist
Historical Society, was made chairman of
the committee and the Rev. Dr. H. L.
Morehouse, field secretary of the Ameri
can Baptist Home Mission Society, the
secretary. The committee has just com
pleted its deliberations and has agreed
upon a statement and recommendations
to the churches of the denomination.
Urges Active Work, Particularly. for
Salvation of the Unconverted,
and a Season of Earnest
Prayer.

Deputy Flynn brought with him to the
Coroner's office a comparatively new
"piece of tubing which was given him by
Fagan. who said that it. was the piece he
haa found hanging to the gasjet and for
which he had substituted tne old one in
his effort to suppress the fact that Miss
Bahrs had taken her life. An autopsy
showed that asphyxiation by illuminating
gas was the cause of death.
The funeral of the unfortunate young
woman will be held on Wednesday after
noon at 2 o'clock from the Fagan resi
dence on Noe street. The interment will
take- place in Odd Fellows' 'Cemetery.

the past eight years had been a stenog

a great favorite with all her business as
s-ocfates, who sincerely mourn her un
timely end.
THE LATE MISS. AMELIA
BAHRS, WHO COMMITTED
SUICIDE BY ASPHYXIATION.
TIME cannot stale the wit nor can
age dull the poetry of "Pygmalion
and Galatea." Last night it was
revived at the Alcazar Theater and
proved a most enjoyable entertain
ment, even to those of us (alas, the flying
years!) who can remember the beautiful
Madge Robertson when she played Gala
tea at the old Haymarket to the unctuous
Chrysos of the venerable Buckatone.
Buckstone has long been withered to a
little thin dust and Madge Robertson has
faded into Mrs. Kerdal, but the beauty of
"Pygmalion and Galatea" can never fade,
and we have still our bliss!
Mr. Hall, with his training In the ro
mantic drama, was entirely at home in the
part of Pygmalion. He spoke the blank
verse admirably (no easy task) and car
ried off the difficult love scenes with the
art that conceals art. Mr. Webster as
Chrysos was irresistibly humorous; comic
oldmen are evidently his line, and. not
"heavies." May he never again be per
suaded to depart from his specialty. My
rine I have never seen better looked than
it was by Miss Stockwell. nor Daphne bet
ter played than It was by Miss Belmore.
Miss Atwood's Cynlsca was, I think, the
best "elocuted"'(if one may use the word)
part in the entire representation. In Gal
atea Miss Convere had an extremely dif
ficult role and one entirely outside the
range of those to which she Is evidently
accustomed- To look Galatea was easy
enough for ner, but to represent the grad
ual awakening of Galatea to sub-con
sciousness and then to consciousness, her
innocent wisdom and her unwise inno
cence, her grief at hearing that she has
brought grief to the man she loves, her
tender devotion and her stern abnegation
â all this calls for a higher intelligence
and a finer technique than are needed for
leading roles in nine plays out of ten.
This intelligence and this technique I am

Interpretation of Japanese scenery, and
the light effects, which play no small part

the house enthralled. The play will run

Lucius Henderson, the actor- pianist, ar

Henderson is well known In San Francisco

Edwin Royle's company, in the plays of
Friends and "Captain Impudence."
"Madame Butterfly," which fully llvea
up to its title of the strongest one-act
play ever written, continues to prove the
big attraction at the Alcazar, and entered
last night on its second week.
The little tragedy tells the simple story
of a Japanese girl, Madame Butterfly,
who imagines herself the wife of an
American naval lieutenant. She discovers
that she has been deceived and ends her
life with the same sword with which she
had threatened one of the lieutenant's
traducers.

with which the audience followed the play
is merely another proof of what 1 have

The ordinance directing the Board of
Public Works to lit up rooms and offices
for various boards and officers In the City
Hall at an expense of $6500 went over for
two weeks. Reed objected to the expendi
ture, as it was not provided for In the tax

tilt between Reed and Uraunhart, who
fathered the ordinancÂ«, both members
taking the opportunity to air in public
their private differences.
The Mayor stated â¢ that . the demands
were being paid under an agreement with
the company, which had reduced its rates
and pending the result of the litigation, as
to whether the old ordinance licensing
nickel machines affected telephone boxes.
McCarthy, however, held that no . such
agreement was valid In the face of the
charter provision which prohibits the pay

phones used by the city departments. Mc-
Carthy and Reed made a strong plea for
the passage of the resolution on the sub
ject. The Auditor had been cited to ap
pear before the board and show cause
why suit should not be brought, but he
failed to put in an appearance.
McCarthy reiterated his contention that
under the charter the demands were be

the Auditor, who has been cited to ap

He bases his reason for signing the tele
phone demands on the ground that the
Finance Committee had signed them first.
This board once directed the Auditor not
to audit these demands, and he persists
in doing so. and says he will continue to
do so. I think it is time that this city
should get a little of what is owing to It

During Governor Waterman's adminis
tration there was a clash between the
executive and legislative departments that
resulted in disaster to the taxpayers. The
Governor thought the Legislature was too
liberal in voting away public money and
therefore sought to check the seeming ex
travagance by a vigorous exercise of the
veto power. The members of the Legis
lature thought that the executive was in
clined to act in a high-handed manner
Republicans and Democrats entertaining
the opinion that the Governor's objections
were inimical to the welfare of the State
formed an alliance in each branch of the
Legislature and passed over the veto the
measures which the Governor objected to
The conditions are favorable for a re
markably low rate of taxation for the
closing years oÂ£ Governor Gage's admin
istration. There are no signs that the
Legislature will be extravagant in the ap
propriation of public money. The State
la prosperous at the present time and
there are many indications of increasing
prosperity for the future. The assess
ment roll is likely to be unusually large.
The tax rate diminishes as the roll 'of
taxable "property expands. It is In the
power of the State Board of Equalization
to bring about a low tax rate by return
ing an unusually large assessment roll.
Assuming that the Legislature will not
be extravagant and that the State Board
of Equalization will increase the assess
ment roll to a considerable extent the pre
diction may be safely made that the tax
rate for Governor Gage's fourth year in
office will be one of the lowest If -not
actually the lowest ever recorded in Cal
ifornia. :- ; '." Â¦.
The danger of a slight clash between
the executive and legislative departments
must always be considered. By the. ex
ercise of tact, judgment and firmness the
chief executive may be able to carry out
his own policy and avoid collision with
the legislative branch of the government.
Leaders in each house can generally hold
in check impulsive members who want to
take the bit in their teeth and ride over
executive vetoes.
The tax levy provided a surplus ex
ceeding a million dollars, which was car
ried over to lower the rate for the last
two years of his term. He contended that
Governor Markham left an empty treas
ury and a load of accumulated obligations
for the State to pay. The Pasadena
statesman, however.' insisted - that he
(Markham) left the treasury in better con
dition than he found It, and that he be
queathed to his successor fewer obliga
tions than he inherited from his prede
cessor.
When Governor Budd went Into the exe
cutive office six years ago he encouraged
the Legislature to make ample appropria
tions to liquidate outstanding obligations
and meet contemplated deficiencies. The
suggestion was accepted by a Republican
Legislature and the result was an ex
ceptionally high State tax for the first
year of his incumbency.
At the present time there is consider
able comment among hold-over Senators
and members-elect, to the effect that Gov
ernor Gage has resolved to adopt a stren
uous policy of retrenchment, and In his
message will urge that economy of the
strictest sort be observed by the law
makers. The Governor is said to be anx
ious to make the tax levy for the last
year of his incumbency the lowest in the
history of California.
The Legislature usually appropriates at
each regular session a sum in excess of
J13.000.000 for maintaining the State gov
ernment for a term of two years. After
a free exercise of the veto prerogative
by the Governor the amount actually al
lowed at each session approximates the
sum of $12,000,000. This sum la sufficient
to meet the expenses of State govern
ment for a period of two years.

corner of California and Powell streets.
"I lived there with my boarders and

Boarding - House Mistress Is
HeiFess to Great Fortune. :!,
FROM the life of a boarding-house
keeper, with an income barely suf
ficient to pay the. butcher and the
baker, to a life" of wealth and ease
is the experience of Miss Lizzie
Kerns of 1409 Leavenworth street. Miss
Kerns yesterday received the following
telegram' informing her . of her changed
position in the world:
MONTREAL.,. Canada, Dee. .8, 1900.
To Miss Lizzie Kerns, J409 " Leavenworth
street, San Francisco: Our Uncle Edward died
November 25 last. Left about five millions to
us sisters and other relatives. .[ You must oome
to Montreal at once. Your sister, _-''Â¦ JANE.
Bade of this there is yet another storyâ
a story of romance, with wedding bells,
a runaway girl, an estrangement of thirty
years and deathbed forgiveness.
That Miss Kerns Is overjoyed at her
gpod fortune is not to be wondered at.
When seen last night at her home she
said:
"Of course, the news made me happy,
and, as is quite natural, has made, me
somewhat excited. But excitement of this
nature is exhilarating, and I, like it.
"Just think of it," she continued, throw
ing up her hands in her glee. "I shall no
longer be frightened by-, the landlord's
knock for rent nor the grocer's bill. And'
I will say one thing posltively-that I'll
never keep boarders or roomers again.
"When I was a young girl my parents
died and I was adopted by my uncle, Ed

speculator and made most of his fortune
in railroad stocks and In the deep cut
canal.
"When I was 18 years old my uncle de

of Ottawa, and the^wedding ceremony was
to take place at 8 "o'clock on the evening
of my birthday. The bridesmaids were
there and all preparations had been made
for a formal church service at Christ's
Church, but fate and an unwilling bride
ruled otherwise. It was to be a marriage
of December and May. Senator Gibson
was 72 years old and I Just 18.

before the time set for the wedding, I
