It was an awful suspenseâ waiting for
relief by the allied troops. Mr. Gamewell
says, and he thinks too much glory can
not be eivern to Captain Myers, who had
charge of the men at the wall. He was
seriously wounded during the siege.
"As to the results of this war," said Mr.
Gamewell, "I do not hesitate to say, and
I believe my sentiments are shared by
many others, that the United States
should Insist that the leaders of the up
rising be punished to the fullest- extent.
Whether that punishment shall take the
form of execution is a matter to be de
termined later, but whatever is done
should be made sufficiently severe to have
a lasting: effect upon the Chinese nation.

CALL. BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.
President McKinley and his Cabi
net took advantage to-day of the
first session held for several
weeks to canvass the Chinese situation
thoroughly, in the light of the latest in
formation at hand. As a result of their
deliberations this Government is likely to
approach the European powers with ref
erence to the reduction of the military
forces now occupying Peking in order to
bring about the return of the Chinese
court and facilitate the opening of peace
negotiations.
Minister Wu, carrying out the sugges
tion contained in the edict relative to the
removal of the Imperial court to Peking,
has urged upon the officials that they
take action that will Insure the return of
the Emperor and Empress Dowager, and
his appeal Â¦will probably be acted upon.
As a first step in this direction it has been
suggested that the guard protecting the
American legation be reduced from 1900 to
not more than 200 men. Should the na
tions retain 1900 men, each In Peking this
would make a force of more than 13,200
men. "With the railroad and telegraph
lines between Peking and Tientsin re
paired, the bulk of the foreign troops
would still be available .at -Tientsin In
case of another outbreak.
In accordance with the request, Minis
ter Conger has cabled a list of the prom
inent Chinese whom he regards as the re
sponsible authors of the outrages on for
eigners and has made recommendations
as to their punishment.
It is understood that the Minister
has named some who were not in
cluded in the recent imperial decree
-when Prince Tuan was degraded.
Among these is doubtless General
Tung Fuh Hsiang and other generals
of the Chinese forces. As to the pun
ishment to be administered he has
undoubtedly recommended that some
be executed and others degraded.
This Government desiring that ex
emplary punishment shall be visited
on the most guilty, will probably
urge that Tuan be beheaded as a fit
ting penalty for his crimes and direct
responsibility for the murder of for
eign and native Christians.
In this connection it is worthy of note
that Minister Wu has united with the
Chinese Ministers In Europe to Impeach
General Tung Fuh Hsiang. In addition to
Prince Tuan and others, and it is hoped
that the Emperor will see fit to degrade
the military commander.
Secretary Hay has received an official
suggestion that the powers shall demand
of China that posthumous honors be paid
to the two members of the Tsung-li Ya
men who, to prevent the murder of for
eigners, altered an imperial edict, and to
the former Chinese Minister to Washing
ton, all of whom were recently executed
In accordance with an Imperial edict. It
Is thought that this would have great ef
fect, pleasing the friends of the foreign
ers and throwing the anti-foreigners Into
dismay. The members of the Tsung-11
Yamen knew that the changing of the
imperial edict would Involve their own
death, and they are looked upon as pa
triots in the highest sense.
The Cabinet considered the proposals
advanced by 'France and Russia, but be
cause of the paramount Importance of the
return of the imperial court to Peking It
is understobd that no answer will be given
for a time. It Is said .that some of the
ideas advanced by the missionaries In Pe
king as to the terms to be exacted of
China may be adopted.
The American Peace Commission has
been practically determined upon. It will
consist of three membersâ Minister Con
ger, General "Wilson, now In Peking, and

GBEAT BRITAIN HOLDS OUT.
All Other Interested Powers Agree to
Germany's Proposals.
BERLIN. Oct. 9.â It was ascertained at
the Foreign Office to-day that all the
powers have agreed to the proposals of
the second German note, with the excep
tion of Great Britain, from whom no an
swer has yet been received to either the
first or second notes of Germany. Tho
Foreign Office, however, expects Great
Britain's adherence to the second note
and still looks for a reply to the first.
With reference to the statement cabled
from America that Great Britain has act
ed as mediator In effecting; an understand
ing between Germany and the United
States, a high Foreign Office official said
that nothing was officially known regard
ing such a service If it had been rendered,
and that as a matter of fact there was no
necessity whatever for a mediator. The
latter statement was corroborated by the
British Embassador. Sir Frank Lascelles,
and by the United States Charge d*Af
faires, John B. Jackson.
No news from Field Marshal Count von
"Waldersee has been received at the For
eign Office since the announcement that
he had taken charge. It is taken for
granted- that the details of organization
are absorbing his attention.

mans occupy the palace of the Empress
in Peking and that German reinforce
ments consisting of two Â¦ battalions, two
guns and cavalry under Lieutenant Col
onel Havel have arrived at Peking from
Tientsin.

received from General Gripsky the Chi

by the Cossacks and escorted to a point
seven versts from the city, where they
were robbed and then driven Into the

the towns along the Amur were destroyed
by the Russians and the inhabitants put

many escaped before the bombardment.

Says Great Britain's Foreign Policy

Secretary of State for the Colonies, speak
ing this evening at Stout bridge, said:
"Great Britain's foreign policy, as I sum
it up, is to remain on friendly terms with
every great country in Europe and on
something more than friendly terms -with
the United States."
Mr. Chamberlain ridiculed the attempt
of the opposition leaders to hold him up
as a bogey to foreign , nations. "Great
Britain's foreign policy,", he exclaimed,
"is in the hands of Lord Salisbury and I
have not the presumption to meddle
with It."

When Mr. Bryan reached the court
house square in Peoria the sides of the
speaker's etand were crowded with a mass
of humanity. The carriage ride from the
depot to the ground was in streets packed
on each side with shouting and cheering
admirers. It was possible for Mr. Bryan
to reach but half of the audience. He
at once launched into the trust subject.
Mr. Bryan 'afterward took occasion to
answer the charges that he is being paid
for his speeches. In part he said:
"I am not rs rich a man as you would
imagine from reading the Republican pa
pers. I find it difficult to reconcile the
statement of Republican papers made
about my financial condition. One . time
they say that I am so ambitious that I
would spend all my money to be President
and another time they say that I am so
avaricious that I will not make a speech
unless I am paid for It. I notice a crit
icism in the papers that the people of
the towns throueh which our train passes
have contributed to the expenses of the
train, and it was suggested that this was
for my benefit. I need not tell you I
receive nothing for making speeches; but,
my friends. I want you to know that when
men ride on trains they must pay or else
the railroad companies must furnish them
with free rides. We do not "want a rail
road to carry our train through the State
and therefore the State- Committee paid
out about a thousand dollars for the train
for yesterday and to-day. We believe it
Is better for people to pay their way and
be Independent than to have corporations
run them after election. I would a great'
deal rather have Republican papers criti
cise me and people along the road pay
than to receive free rides from the rail
j road companies and have corporations run

trams."

standpoint Is to exhume Mr. Bryan's
prophecies with their signal non-fulfill
ment."
Governor Roosevelt then enumerated
some of the predictions which he
declared had been made four years ago
by Mr. Bryan, which the facts to-day
proved erroneous. He continued:
'â¢Mr. Bryan said mortgages would go
up, and they were the only things that
went down. Mortgages have diminished
in amount by nearly 40 per cent. When
these things were pointed out to Mr.
Bryan the other day and it was shown to
him that we were prosperous he answered
that It war not the Republican party but
Providence that made us so. Now I am
perfectly willing to admit that there has
been a fusion between Providence and the
Republican party. The Democracy has
fused with about everything else, but
somehow or other It has never managed
to connect with Providence.
"Now, gentle-men, I don't wonder that
in the hard times, when things were look

The local firms pledge themselves not

drummers. They say that they do not
want any drummers sent to the islands,
and by to-day's mail all the leading firms
of the Pacific Coast are rrotlfied that such

The resolutions adopted voicing the deci
cision carry with them Â¦ a threat that
firms that do not regard' the wishes of the
firms here will 1 be boycotted In Honolulu.
All the largest local firms are In the com
pact. . Â¦
The merchants claim that they are
obliged to carry very, heavy stocks of
goods here, on account of the distance
from the mainland, but that among the
130.000 population of the. islands only 15,000
are whites, so that the consumption is
limited, and that some 'of the San Fran

HONOLULU, Oct. 2.â Hawaii's three
cornered political " fight Is now fairly
started. Republicans, Democrats and In
dependent Home Rulers all having tickets
in the field. The Independents have flung
to the breeze at their headquarters a ban
ner bearing a picture of King Kameha
meha I, the great Hawaiian monarch who
first conquered all the islands. This is
taken as something of an appeal to race
feeling, the two American parties claiming
that it is another proof that the Hawaiian
party is carrying on an anti-white cam
paign.
The Democratic party has suddenly dis
covered, after' It had nominated Prince
David for Congress and he had gone to
the island of Hawaii on a stumping tour,
that he had not registered and would not
be back until too late to do so. This would
have made him ineligible &s a candidate.
The Central Committee to-day chartered
the Interisland steamer Walaleale and
pent It to Hllo after the Prirnce. He will
be brought to Honolulu as quickly as pos
sible and piven a chance to register, after
which, he will go to Hawaii, again and re
sume bis campaigning. : ' ''Â¦'
The Independents will hold-.their regular
nominating convention, next, Wednesday,
when they will put their full ticket in the
field. There Is no doubt, 'however, about
the-, nomination of It. W. Wilcox for Con
gress or about the general complexion of
the ticket. Â¦' "
The 'Registration Board is having a good
deal of ; trouble in making riflings on dis
puted points regarding registration of
those wh'o wish to vote." Three suits have
already been brought against the board.
In the most. important case the Supreme
Court ruled that the men whb have no
other homes than.'' on .-the interisland
steamers are not entitled .to register and
vote. This deprives over fifty men in
Honolulu of their. votes ami a fe.w on tho
other islands. iii Â¦

WILKESBARRE. Pa.. Oct. 9.â The lead
ers of the United Mine Workers of this
part of the anthracite coal field do not
speak as hopefully to-night of a settle
ment of the strike by the Scranton con
vention as they did yesterday. Some of
them are afraid that the offer of a 10 per
cent increase in wages made by the com
panies may not last long, and that after
the men are back at work for a while
and the market is pretty well supplied
the operators may reduce wages to the
old figure. It is only fair to say, how
ever, that not all of the mine workers are
of this opinion. There is a strong senti
ment prevailing that the companies are
sincere and that the increase of wages
will be permanent.
In making the advance in wages the
operators did not act in concert but as
individuals, so that if the convention In
sists upon a definite understanding with
the mine owners a week may elapse be
fore the views of the operators can be had
â¢ SCRANTON. Pa.. Oct. 9.â Interviews
with prominent coal operators here to-day
elicited a uniform declaration that no
further concessions "or modifications of the
present offer will be made, and that the
miners must take It or leave It just as it
stands. They say it Is plain and complete
and contains all they can or will concede.
The 10 per cent increase means that every
man in the anthracite mines is to have
$1 10 for the work for which he formerly
received $1, the operators say.
SHAMOKIN, Pa., Oct. 9.-President
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers came

life away." â¢> Â» â¢ , " â¢ .
Two or three Deputy Sheriffs went over
and grabbed . him. He struggled wildly

him.
"I will not sit down. T n*ver said a

Youtsey the day he was arrested, late in
the afternoon In the jail in Frankfort, in
reference to. the murder of my brother."
Just at this point Youtsey arose behind
his attorneys and said in a loud voice:
GEORGETOWN. Ky., Oct. 9.â One of
the most remarkable scenes ever enacted
In a Kentucky court occurred to-night in
the YciKsey Trial, the defendant himself
being the chief participant. The court
room v. as crowded at the time and the
excitement was intense. D. E. Arm
strong, the I-oulsville detective, had just
told of his talks with Vcutsey before and
after his arrest. Theft Arihur- Goebel
was put en the star.d, and Judge Ben
\\ :lliamÂ«=. who for the tlr?t time appeared
for ti-.e prosecution, did the questioning:.
Youtsey still occupied Mr chair with his
eyes closed, apparently In a half-falntlng
condition. After the crowd passed out
Jailer Reed and deputies carried Youtsey
to the jail, as he was unable to walk.
Various reasons are assigned for his un
seemly outbreak, the first being that his
long confinement and the strain, of tho
trial caused him to become hysterical and
lose control of himself. Another is that
he Is really demented, as shown by his
remark that. Goebel was not dead. Yout
sey is bcir^r attended, by physicians and
relatives ai the jail and [his condition is
deemed critical. " ''..
"Mr. Sheriff, if the defendant does not
behave himself, put hanaculfs on him."
said Judge Cantrill. ILumwhile the au
dience could not be forced to keep their
seats until the Judge threatened to 'fine
those who stood up. Youtsey settled back
in his chair, closed his eyes and seemed
In a state of collapse. He waved his
handkerchief above his head in an aim
less way. and groaned and cried hysteri
cally. Finally quiet was restored, ami
Judge Williams asked Arthur Ooebel
another question, when Colonel Crawford
asked a postponement of the trial until
to-morrow on account of the defendant'.'
condition. Judge Cantrill said he could
see no cause or reason for tho defendant's
outbreak, but In juftlceto the attorneys
ho would rostpone the case until to-mor
row. Mr. Franklin suid the common
wealth had not the slightest objection to
cOjoumlng until to-niorrow and the court
so ordered.
Arthur Goebel, meanwhile, sat sphinx
like In the witness chair and never
turned his head. Finally after Youtsey
was forced Into a seal, he shouted again:
"Gcebel is not deadâ all the demons in
hell could not kill him."

ADMIRATION
FOR BERESFORD'S
NAVAL STRATEGY
. LONDON. Oct. 10. 3 a* m.â From the re
turns received at midnight it appears that
t!;e Government gained two scats in yes
terday's pollings in the Parliamentary
general elections. These are the Middle
ton division of Southeast Lancashire,
where E. D. Flelden : defeated J. Duck
worth, Liberal, who represented the con
stituency in the last Parliament, and
Monmouth. where Dr. Kutherford Harris,
who now enters Parliament for the first
time, received 4412 votes, as against 3720
cast for his liberal . opponent. Alberc

with a majority of 2270 over his Liberal
opponent, A. W. Chapman, and that of
John Edward Ellis. Liberal, in the Jtush
ciifTe division of Nottinghamshire. Mr.
Kills has represented Rushcliffe since lisSo.
The ministerialists in lighting hi>n made
effective use of his pro-Boer letters so
recently published by Mr. Chamberlain,
and the majority he secured at the gen
eral election of 1S95 was reduced by-lM
>< The" Liberals are holding their own la
Yorkshire, and in some districts their
candidates have doubled the majorities of
the previous general election. Five hun
dred and twenty-two members have now
' been officially declared elected, of which
337 are ministerialists and 1S5 belong to
the opposition. The minlsteriallsta have
gained five more seats than their op
ponents.
Considerable adverse comment. Conserv
ative as well as Liberal, has been caused
by the declaration, attributed to Mi.
Chamberlain, in a recent speech, "a seat
lost to the Government is a seat sold to
the Eoers." Mr. Chamberlain writes tj
the Daily Mall thi3 morning repudiating
the statement and explaining that what
he said was a quotation from the Mayor
of Mafeklng. "a- seat lost to thÂ« Govern
ment is a seat gained by the Boers.'
The Daily Mail, commenting editorially
upon Mr. Chamberlain's communication,
still Insists that he went too far in view
of the fact that "quite a large number of
Liberals have consistently supported the
Government's South African policy."
The paper al36 ' declares that "Mr.
Chamberlain's tactics will not assist him
in his struggle for the Premiership and
will arouse uneasiness as to his qualifi
cations for the Foreign Office."

MARES CHARGES OF CRUELTY
Defendant Is Away on a Hunting
Trip, but Will Return in
Time to ' Rsceive
i Summons.
Mrs. Lottie A. Garretson filed suit in
the Superior Court yesterday for divorce
from her husband, Frederick William
Garretson, a well-known business man of
San Diego. She charges cruelty, alleging
many specific acts. In addition to the de
cree of divorce, she asks, for a division of
the community property and for perma
nent alimony.
The complaint was filed with the County
Clerk during the afternoon by Mrs. Gar
retson's attorneys. Bishop & Wheeler.
Summons was mailed at once for service
on the defendant at his home.
The news of the*dlvorce proceedings will
probably come as a surprise to San Die
giins, as, according: to a dispatch received
from that city last night, not the slightest
sound of any family jar had reached the
public ear.
The - Garretsons were married about
three years ago, Mrs. Garretson having
been Miss Lottie Curtis, a pretty young
woman. There rfre no children. Garret
eon is manager of the San Diego Cycle
and Arms Company. One of his brothers
is cashier of the First National Bank of
San Diego and another is president of the
Gas and Investment Company at the same
place.
It was not known how long Mr. and
Mrs. Frederick William Garretson had
been separated. The defendant, who was
in the Kast for some time on business, re
turned to his home a few days ago, but
is at present said to be on a hunting trip,
entirely ignorant of the summons that
will reach San EMego by the time of his
return.
Mrs.- Garretson has taken up her resi

In this legal controversy. Judse Mahon
Ot Bakersfteld was conducting three pe
titions which had been filed for letters
testamentary on the estate, the applicants
being Lillian Page, the widow, ami two
sons, Solomon and Ellas Page. Mrs. Ll!
han Page was on the witness stand, and
to impeach her testimony Attorney W.
W. Cross asked tha.t a -will which she
presented some time ago and withdrew
and which was alleged to be a forgery be

structed to brinp it in and returned from
lus office with wirat he suppossa was the
Â»!ocuinent. It was in an envelope sealed
and marked "Will c^ Samuel Page."
When the envelope was opened it was
found to cuntain two wlUs which iiad
I'ever been ottered In court before. Tnero
v.as excHerriVnl at once among the at

an entirely new front upon the case.
One of the wills was made Jn lSyS and

California supply a ''sugar fountain" to

General N. P. Chlpman presided at tha
meeting. : ' % ,
In the form of a preliminary report con
cerning his observations at the Paris Ex
position W. H. Mills yesterday gave prac
tical advice to the State Board of Trade.
He said that the proper things for Cail
fornians to do were to send fruit pulp
abroad, for which there la a practically
unlimited market In Europe; devote at
tention to the forcing of fruits for winter
use in the New York market; send to the
Pan-American Exhibition to be held at
Buffalo a corps of from ten to twenty
men competent to answer all questions
concerning the resources, climate and
population of California.
Upon these points Mr. Mills gave the
members of the board an Interesting and
valuable talk.
Fruit pulp, he explained. Is made of
culla and inferior fruit and Is packed in
large cans without sugar. The absence
of sugar makes the customs duties levied
abroad very low. The other advantage
is that fruits are brought within the reach
of European people in such shape that
they can, bÂ« treated according to foreign
methods of cookery. '
Concerning the fercing of fruits for the
New York winter market Mr. Mills said
that Europeans were making large money
marketing winter grown fruits in New
York, and in his opinion California could
get that trade. In one place abroad he
saw a fruit forcing plant, the dimensions
of which were HW.X15 feet. Yet the money
value of the product in the market
equaled the selling value of fifty acres
of grapes In California. Forced peaches
bring *2 each in Paris in winter, and
bunches of grapes sell for $1 50 each. The
climate is such that tires have to be used
six months in the year, whereas in Cali
fornia fruit would ripen under glass when
ever the sun shines.
Concerning the necessity for sending
from ten to twenty men. to Buffalo to ex
plain the exhibit to be made there and
the collateral facts, Mr. Mills said that
unless explanations could be made to in
telligent -inquirers the exhibit would do
little good. The State exhibit that was
sent to Paris had no one to explain any
thing concerning it. That exhibit was
turned over to the American authorities
upon arrival and became part of- the
French show. It did no good. Mr. Mills
said that Interpreters who could speak
several foreign languages were of advan
tage to exhibitors abroad.
The board requested Mr. Mills. to pre
pare â¢ a formal report. Letters â¢ and tele
grams were read by Secretary Denlson.
Among them was a telegram from-F. W.
Taylor, superintendent of the department
Garden Party at Dominican College.
A garden party for the . benefit of the
Dominican College atÂ»San Rafael wilt be

day afternoon and evening. Therefwill be

bags, fishing ponds. Ice cream booths, etc.

WE can measure the increase of Amerl
can industry in three ways: First,
by the increase in exrtortatlon of
dustries. In this decade t we find
that the importation of manufacturers' mate
rials Is more than doubled; for while our man
ufacturers utilize our home materials as far as
practicable In their industries, there are certain
materials which they require which are not
produced at home, while in others the supply
fxr. home production is not sufficient to meet
their requirements. In crude rubber and silk,
for Instance, all of the materials utilized must
be Imported. In following the course of the
Importation cf manufacturers' materials in ISM
it is possible to measure In some degree the ac
tlvtyeÂ« of our manufactories since 1890. The
Importation of manufacturer's materials in lS?i)
amounted to $17S.0C0.C00, or 23 per cent of our
total importation?: while in the fiscal year 1900
they amounted to $310,000,000 and formed S6 per
cent of the total importations.
â¢â¢ â¢ Â»
In the* export of our manufactured articles
the same rule obtains, for the fiscal year ISM
showi ths total value of our exported manufac
tured goods to have been $150,000,009, while the
fiscal year 1900 places the amount at $423,000,000.
an Increase of nearly 800 per cent. Along this
same line we meantime find our importa
tion" of manufactured goods to have been in
1890 $34j,0Q0.0CO and forming 44 per cent of our
total import trade, while la 1300 they were but
$2<Â».000.000 and formed but 37 per cent of the
total imr>ortB.
â¢ â¢ â¢
And the question naturally arises in your
.mlr.d. what has gone along with this increased
activity of our manufacturing plants? The
pnswer, though simple. Is all important. -It lies
in the fact that wages have steadily advanced
under the present Republican administration.
It is the story of ths difference to-day existing
among the wage-earning population and those
that existed during the laat Democratic admin
istration. It is the story of the contrast of
the earnings of our people now living under
thÂ«* protective tariff with those paid during the
operation of the Wilson free trade bill of the
Democratic party. A few facts will show how
widespreatl'and uniform the advances In wages
have been: â¢ Bricklayers and masons show in
1S9S an increase of 10 per cent In their wages;
In 1S99 the increase was 25 per cent. Iron ship
builders, going hand in hand with the brick
layers, secured in 1S90 an Increase of 10\per
crnt. -while 1S99 found them stil better off with
an Increase of 20 per cent. The members of
the bookbinders' craft, not to be outdone by
their rivals, advanced 10 per cent in 1S9S. and
again in 1893 find their wages Increased IS per
cent. Nor are the shoemakers out of the race,
for in 1898 their earnings Increased 10 per cent
and the following year found another Increase
of 25 per cent. Our engineers fared even bet
ter, for 1898 gave them a gain of 20 per cent
In their earning capacity, while 1S99 found them
DO per cent better off. Those sturdy men who
give us our supply of th'e precious metals found
their labor-producing powers Increased 26 # per
cent In 1S9S and the next twelve months gave
them another raise of 40 per cent. Finally, the
stage employes show the great Increase In 1898
of 200 per cent, and again in 1R99 we find them
with the magnificent betterment of 300 per cent
Need I go further along the list?
1AM pround to be a Republican; glad of the
opportunity to acknowledge my allegiance to
the party of Grant, of Garfleld. of the mar
tyred Lincoln, to the party of progress and
achievement, the party that stands for na
tional welfare, for the national honor, for sound
money and the glory of the American flag. I
am glad to pledge my first vote to William Mc-
Klnley and Theodore Roosevelt, for continued
prosperity at home and prestige abroad.
â¢ Â» â¢
No party was ever more worthy of the sup
port of the American people. No President was
ever more worthy of their fullest confidence,
their unstinted admiration, than William Mc-
Klnley. During his administration every decla
ration of the St. Louis platform has been car
ried out. The protective tarifT has been revised
and placed in force; the gold standard has been
upheld and firmly established; our credit has
been maintained. Prosperity has taken the
place of poverty, factories have been opened, the
wheels of industry have been set in motion.
The dercon of want which stalked abroad In
the land has been driven from oifr shores. The
poor have become well-to-do and are every
where prosperous and happy. And notwith
standing that we have waged an expensive
war the national treasury has been filled.
What need Is there for change, from the party
of conservatism and' stability to the party of
opposition and Insincerity? There Is none, and
the verdict In November will be overwhelmingly
for McKlnley and more prosperity.
We have heard a great deal about the para
mount issue. At first it was free ellver. Bryan
forced that plank upon the platform, but after
the opening of the campaign the party speak
ers became strangely silent on that topic. Ex
cept In communities where free 'silver is still
conceived to be necessary to the .national wel
fare. Democratic orators never refer to that
dead Issue. Now a' new paramount Issue has
been dressed out by the party's standard
bearer, to be paraded on every occasion. 'Yet
If Bryan be elected he will be bound Just as
much to the free sliver principle as he was by
the Chicago platform In- 1S96. But he will be
rebuked at the polls, even more decidedly than
four years ago. â¢ ,
â¢ â¢ â¢
As a last "resort the Democrats have raised
the cry of imperialism. They have even gone
so far as to say that the triumph of McKinley
would mean the downfall of the republic. As
a matter of history It was Bryan's Influence
more than any other power that secured the ac
ceptance' of the treaty of peace, by which we
acquired the Philippines and are now governing
them without their consent.
* * * .
In the position of the Republican party on
the Philippine question there Is nothing of,
unworthy motive. We are in the Philippines
not for conquest and material gain, but -from
duty and our responslbilty to civilization". We
have taken up the white man's burden and we
will not flinch under It. In the name of hu
manity American blood has been shed there.
The American flag has been planted In those
Islands. There as here it Is the emblem of
honor and Justice, and the American people will
not permit it to be hauled down.
IN a campaign where as many different is
sues are discussed in the party platforms
as the present. It is necessary for us to
look at the relative attitudes of the two
parties as to , those issues. If we find
leaders of one party vacillating In their at
titude toward important Issues, if we find them
talking on one Bide or the other, as expe
diency requires, we may be sure that -party ft
peoklr.2 Its own selfish ends and not the gen
eral good of our nation. â¢
The only lssu*> seriously debated at the Kan
pas City convention was the. sliver question.
Finally, by the kind permission of Richard
Croker, they inserted a plank in their plat
form calling for the Immediate resumption of
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the
rato of 16 to 1. Mr. Bryan refused to be a
candidate unless this plank was in the plat
form. . But Mr. Bryan himself and all the other
Democratic leaders tell you men of California
and the mm of all the sound money States that
this plank meant nothing, that there are other
paramount issues. But how about the silver
States? There the Democratic orators, with
crowns* of virtue on their heads, point with
pride to the explicit declaration in th^Ir plat
form In favor of an Issue that was dead and
burled four years ago. '
The Democrats denounce the trusts and cry
out for their total abolition: further, they de
nounce the Republican party as the party of
trusts. While Dick Croker. the head of Tam
many Hall, the man by whose grace the silver
plank was allowed to go in the platform, con
trols the elgnntlc KeTV York ice trust. The
Republican party stands for the regulation of
trusts by national legislation, and stands on
Its present record as the promulgator of all
the anti-trust legislation now on the statute
books of the United States.
The one marked characteristic of the Demo
cratic platform and of their party leaders Is
insincerity. Where 16 to 1 Is a popular vote
getting; measure, the Democrats howl for 16 to
1. Where antl-lmperiallsm sounds well, the
Democrats cry out against antl-lmperiallsm;
but where they can gain strength by keeping
down the negro vote, they disfranchise the ne
groes of the Carollnas. The Democratic' party
has no policy of Us own. It stands out pre
eminent as the party of opposition.
The Republican party stands on something
more substantial than mere promises; it
stands on its record for the past four years.
Its statesmen point with pride to the restora
tion of our country's , finances and their re
establishment on a firm basis. Europe has for
the first time , come to America to borrow
money. The United States is now the creditor
of the world. The Republican administration
has er.erted all Its efforts toward the pacifica
tion of the Philippine Islands; order has been
restored In Cuba; yes, and within the last two
'months a' Republican administration Initiated a
movement by which the armies of the civilized
world rescued from the Chinese Boxers many
of our fellow countrymen- These facts speak
for themselves.
First voters, your choice is between a party
of sincerity and a party of Insincerity, between
a partv of performance and a party of prom
ise: between a party of constructive legislation
and a 'Party of political demagoglsm. In a
word, between McKlnley the statesman and
Bryan the demagogue. '
tr IKE many other campaigns which pre
11 ceded it this is a campaign of more
f| . than ordinary Importance. It !s Im
portant to those of us who cast our
first vote for McKinley and Roosevelt,
for It wi'l bring good luck to us all our lives.
It is important to Mr. McKinley, fir he will
not have to begin housemovlng for another
four years. He is a man of very sedentary
habits. I believe. It will even be Important
to our physical geography. For that silver
voice of <*<>lonÂ«>l Bryan, which has come to be
recognize! as a part of our atmosphere, will
still linper Im-Ingly in th<! hollow, of our hill
sides, will still ripple over our vast plains,
until it swells at last., thank heavens, in the
ocean's roar or Is lost in the serene skies of
rrtxrerlty.
After those Immutable principle* of Justice
and right had brought us to present hiÂ«h
prospects, the war with Spain was a â¢logical
outcome of these principles and of our de
velopment and every American should be as
proud of It as any other achievement of our
career. Not alone that we overcame in arms
a heroic and chivalrous people, not alone that
we opened the f.elds of light to the Cubans and
Filipinos. That is not the full measure of our
glory; but that we announced to the world that
we were now a power to be reckoned with In
the logic of events; that we announced to the
wnrM. to history. tÂ« posterity that we were
now to take our place in the front rank of
nations: that wherever an American cltlrsn
was on the face of the globe he was under
the shadow of the flag: that wherever that
flag was raised before the gaze of man It would
be to him. no matter what complexion a trop
ical sun may have burned upon him, no mat
ter in what disastrous battle his liberty may
have been cloven down, it would be to him
another star of Bethlehem bringing the old
tidings of peace on earth and good w.111 to
men. .
Thorp is no Democratic party since McKln
ley. taking splendid advantage of hie oppor
tunity, wiped away the last traces of that In
tfrnecine struggle which threatened our exist
ence by calling on all sections to fight for one
country- The scattered, fragment* of that
party are merely held together by the strength
of lungs of one man. And the idols of the old
Democrat, his traditions, the spirits of his
heroes, all call on him to sever himself from
the Fand-lotters. the- communists, the anar
chifts, the socialists, the sans culottes and
the whole batch of variegated aslnlnity pro
faning the name of Democrat. When we con
trast the wise and statesmanlike polfcy of our
President, his attempt to enlist all the ele
ment^ of this country In on>> triumphant march
against foreign domination in these regions, his
maintenance of our honor as a nation which
has duties imposed upon It by the oode of na
tions arising out of the war. his protection of
American citizens abroadâ if we contrast this
record with the charlatanism and harlequln
lsm of the Bryan parties in the same crisis, we
thank God that we have an American gentle
man at the head of affairs, and a patriot who
loves his country more than his party.
It If incredible that this great nation should
be deterred from taking its rightful place
among the nations of the earth by any terror
of inviting the destiny of the little city-states
of Greece or the state of Rome, in which there
wtre but two classes, the patricians and their
retainers and the mob.
FIRST voters had the floor at Met
ropolitan Temple last night. A
monster rally of them was held
under the auspices of the I'nloa
L#*ague Club. The speakers were
mostly young men who have just
reached the voting age. TheJr speeches
were aglow with enthusiasm, and tha
demonstrations of the auditors showed
that there was good red blood in their
veins.
The crowd was one of the largest that
has gathered for any rally of the cam
paign. While young men were there In
great numb<Â»rs. the young women were
there also, and old men andâ other young
women â a*= well.
W. M. Abbott, a member of the board of
directors of the Union League Club, called
the meeting to order with a statement of
the conditions which led to the suggestion
of the meeting. There are 4000 young men
in Fan Francisco who will cast their first
vote at the coming election, and the im
portance of that vote led to the arrange
ment for the first voters' meeting. Mr.
Abbott introduced J. M. Mannon Jr. as
the chairman of the evening.
The young chairman, who is a son of
Judge j. M. Mannon of T'kiah and a grad
uate of the University of California, class
cf tf, spoke with ability and dignity on
"The Opposition Party." Ransom C. Van
Fleet, son of ex-Judge W. C. Van Fleet,
spoke on the "Logic of the Spanish-
American War."
R. S. Pierce, president of the McKlnley
end Roosevelt Club of the University of
California., spoke on "Imperialism" with
an easy and rapid delivery and self-pos-
Fession that an old campaigner might
envy.
Congressman Julius Kahn, who had
been received with a storm of cheers upon
his entrance, was the next speaker. He
epoke in part as follows:
"Facts are stubborn things. Four years
ago the thousands of unemployed work
ingmen in San Francisco made a problem
that cried for solution. As a makesmft
to tide over the troublesome days they
were put to work on a boulevard. Soup
houses were established to keep laborers
alive by charity. Now. four years later,
the factories axe going, and laborers are
employed. To-day there is peace and hap
piness and industry where four years ago
there was idleness and misery and want.
The first condition existed at the close of
the last Democratic administration, and
the last is the result of four years of Re
publican administration."
Continuing. Mr. Kahn spoke eloquently
on the Philippine question. Following him
another first voter. Herbert L. Rothchild.
spoke, his subject being- "The Full Dinner
Pall." '
R. G. Hudson, the last of the first voter
speakers, talked on "Trusts." While he
did not say there were no trusts he ably
established the proposition that there is
no trust issue.
AX ancient sag* has told us "Harpy Is
the nation which has no history" Cut
I say happy is the nation which havlne
a history, has one chronicling th* fle<"1.5
of illustrious sons. Our young republic
builded out of the West has had many RUi'h.
but among the many there are three whVh will
shine forth with a luster undlmnvd when in
the march of time the Anslo-Saion tonRUÂ»
shall have been forgotten and when the record
of theso United States shall have fadpd from
the halls of history- They are th<Â» name* of
Washington. Lincoln and McKlnW-y. Â¦Wash
ington founded our republic. Lincoln preserved
It to posterity and McKlnley has made It a
world rower.
There is no Issue of "trusts." The only dif
ference between the two parties Is this. That
the attitude of the Democratic party looks to
constant agitation with no restrictive lecisla
tlon: that of the Republican party to such re
striction as will prevent arbitrary advance in
prices or reduction In wages thrpugh exclusive
control, but not destruction' by legislation or
injury by fictitious agitation of llgltamate en
terprise, through great manufacturing ays
terns by which cost of production Is lessened,
price of manufactures reduced and permanency
of employment assured.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Democratic party opposes every com
blnatlor, good or bad. It stmply echoes the
old fry. "Can any good thing come out of
Xazareth?"
The difference between the Democratic and
the Republican policy is the difference be
tween a blind and senseless hatred and careful
and lexical legislation.
The Republican party Is as firmly opposed to
trusts and monopolies as a party can well be
and is proceeding in a sane and. a logical man
ner to eradicate such evils. The Democratic
policy Is only agitation for effect.
The real .attitude of thÂ« Democratic party
with reference to control Is shown in the vote
on the constitutional amendment proposed by
the Reoublleans and voted upon In the House
June 1. 1900. On that vote were 134 ayes, of
which 150 were Republican and 132 noes, of
which 130 were Democrats and Populists. The
resolution, of course, failed to pass, as a two
thirds vote was required, and Its rejection was
thus accomplished solely by Democratic votes.
The Democrats are "agin everything."
Taking Into consideration all of the propo
sitionsâthe legislation by the Republican party,
the opposition of the Democrats, and their con
tinuous agitation without any definite plansâ It
should be an easy matter for the voter to
determine which of the two great parties is
really In earnest In Its attempt to crush out
Illegal and unjust combinations and conspira
cies. The attitude of one Is agitation and
senseless tirade against everything, good or
bad. The Democratic party Is simply echoing
the old cry. "Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?" and accusing the Republican party
of friendship for the trusts. The /tepubllcan
party is as firmly opposed to all wrongful com
binations as a party can be and is proceeding
in a sane and logical manner to eradicate all
such. Between these policies there Is no chance
for choice. Between blind hatred on the one
side and careful, efficient legislation on the
other, there should be no hesitation.
ARTHUR "W. NORTH of "Woodland,
one of the First Voters of four
years ago. spoke briefly after the
last of the new First Voters had
finished. He won a great burst of
applause by reading the following from a
Personal letter written to him four years
ago by Theodore Roosevelt:
"I don't mean to advise you to be an
Impractical theorist, for I don"t like Im
practical theorists. I want you to keep
with our party an long as you can. and to
keep In touch with the people as long as
you can. but if In any given emergency
you find that acting up to your convic
tions necessitates your incurring public or
party odium why shut your teeth and
take It."
Congressman Eugene F. Loud was the
last speaker. IIÂ« was received with pro
longed applause. He spoke. In part, as
follows:
"Our country is not In danger. If
Bryan be elected the country will not be
destroyed. But Its prosperity will bo
stayed until opportunity has come for an
other change to be made. No time since
I have been a voter has it seemed to me
so easy for a young man to know on
which side to cast his first vote.
"The Republican party has stood firmly
for protection and sound money and wo
have driven the Democrats to ground.
Mr. Bryan Is a man with a purpose, ami
ho will never deviate from 16 to 1 as Ion?
as he has a voice to speak and strength
to act."
The Union League Club quartet sang a
number of campaign songs, -which were
interspersed through the programme. En
cores -were demanded at each appearance
oi the auartet.
At the close of the meeting the first
voters present were asked to remain and
effect an organization. Young men stayed
by the hundreds and the following reso
lutions were adopted:
Resolved. That we. the first voters of
â¢ California, in mas>9 meeting assembled.

Rev. Mr. Kip's connection with the
Episcopal Mission of the Good Samaritan
has brought him into prominence as Â¦ a
successful administrator and a self-deny
ing clergyman. He has been a generous
contributor to the work and has accom
plished much good ln a neglected portion
of the city. .
The minister was taken to Redlands,
where he is now lying in the hope that
the genial climate would bring about his
recovery, but the change proved Â¦without
avail. .
The friends of the Rev. "William I. Kip
Jr. are much distressed at the unfavor
able tidings which have been received re
garding his physical condition. A year
ago Rev. Mr. Kip was prostrated by a
severe attack of the grip, which later de
veloped into consumption. Weighed down
by the great responsibilities of his work,
the young clergyman w?is unwilling to re
tire and remained at his post until abso
lutely compelled by weakness to abandon
lt altogether.
The physicians encouraged the falling
man and believed that rest would soon re
store his strength, but the reverse proved
to be the case.
Hope for Him.

A proposition was made to Chief Sulli
van yesterday by the poolroom men that
the cases remaining on the Police Court
calendars should not be pushed to trial
until a decision was reached in the Supe
rior Court on one of the appealed cases.
The Chief made a counter proposition. He
said if the poolsellers were anxious to test
the constitutionality of the ordinance he
would select the case in which Harry
Piper took one end of a pool ln Corbett's
and Lieutenant Birdsall the other end. It
could be heard before one of the Judges
without a Jury at once and the matter
quickly decided in the Superior Court on
appeal. Corbett and Abrams were will
ing, but their attorney, George D. Col
lins, would not'eonsent, and the Chief in
structed Attorney Coffey to push the re
maining cases vigorously to trial in the
Police Courts.
John Riley, a clerk In Zlck Abrams'
poolrooms, who was convicted about a
week ago by a Jury in Judge Cabaniss'
court for violating the ordinance against
poolselling, appeared for sentence yester
day afternoon. The Judge sentenced him
to pay a dne of $100. Notice of appeal
was given and his bonds were fixed in
$500.

John T. Dare. United States Appraiser
at this port, returned last Monday night
from a. trip to the East and has an in
teresting story to tell of the political out
| look. "While in New York Mr. Odell, Re
publican candidate for Governor of that
State, told him that Croker could defeat
him only by carrying Manhattan by 80,000
majority and that such a majority is im
possible. The Republicans are confident
that President McKinley will carry the
State of Xew York. According to Mr.
Dare's idea, Mr. Croker's efforts on behalf
of the Democracy appear to be made by
a man who is laboring to float .himself
hereafter. He wants to make a showing
to hold Croker to the front. Since Sep
tember the feeling in that State for
President McKinley has very much im
proved, t
Notwithstanding this confidence, the Re
publicans are well organized and hard at
work. They are holding meetings in New
York and Brooklyn every day from 11
o'clock in the forenoon until late at
night. On Bernard street and Broadway
is the headquarters for the Dry Goods Im
porters' Republican Club and 3000 chaira
are constantly rilled during the daily
meetings. All the Republican halls in tbe
city are filled to overflowing. At Central
Park, Camp McKinley, an Immense circua
tent under which may be seated 5000 peo
ple is tilled from 3 p. in. until late at
night. There are speakers in abundance,
and they average thirty minutes each, or
otherwise as long as they can hold their
audiences. In the Bowery, the great
stronghold of the Democracy, the Repub
lican clubs begin their meetings at mid
day and continue well Into the night. Mr.
Dare addressed several of these meetings
, by Invitation and was listened to very
' courteously by a mixed audience. In
i Kings County and Brooklyn the Repub
licans will give tbe local boss a lively
contest.
Mr. Dare was very much surprised to
learn that the Republicans were claiming
Maryland. On the last evening he spent
in New York he saw a Republican bet
J1000 against $750 that President McKinley
would carry Maryland. In the .cities of
Columbus, Canton and Alliance, Ohio, Mr.
Dare heard the people declare that the
Republicans were going to make a new
I record for Ohio and give a larger Repub-
I lican majority than ever before, reaching
| up to 100,000. Illinois is considered by
i Republicans to be a close State because
j Cook County, in which the city of Chicago
is situated, will poll a very large Demo
cratic vote. There is more activity ex
hibited In behalf of Bryan In Chicago
than anywhere else, but the Republicans
claim that they will offset that by the
returns from the rest of the State. In
Nebraska Roosevelt in the rain addressed
larBer audiences than Bryan did In the
sunshine. At Ogden Mr. Dare was as
sured that Utah would send its three elec
iÂ£Â£.i, Votes for McKinley this year. In
f^,,^^ e votes went for Bryan. He

The announcement of the betrothal of
the young couple foreshadowed In
The Call yesterday morning took
nounced the engagement of her
daughter. Miss Mamie McXutt. to Lieu
tenant Ashton Potter of the Fourth Cav
alry, now stationed at Manila.
AT a small and delightful tea at
the McXutt residence on Pacific
avenue yesterday afternoon Mrs.
W. F. McXutt formally an-
the keen edge from the surprise:
still It was the first chance the young
lady's friends had of offering their con
gratulations, and they were not slow to
avail themselves of that opportunity. No
day has as yet been set for the wedding.
There is a probability, should the* lieu
tenant not receive leave of absence, that
his fair young fiancee will go to Manila,
where the wedding will, under those cir
cumstances, take place.
The directors of the San Francisco
Jockey Club met yesterday In Its offices
in the Crocker building and among other
business transacted were the appoint
ments of officials other than presiding
judge. As has already been published, J.
H. Pettlnglll will occupy that position.
Ed Cole, a well known New Ifork news
paper man. -will act as associate judge at
Tanforan Park and EM Power will again
have charge of the scales. Sam Morton,
who has enjoyed a world of turf experi
ence, will take charge of the entry de
partment. Bob â¢ McGibben could no't be
overlooked as caller, and together with his
siren voice is due here In a few days.
Almost as indispensable, Sam McGibben,
who has complete control of the riders,
was given his old positionâ that of issuing
the Jockey slips. George Baldwin has
been selected as one of the timers, and an
Eastern, turf correspondent will be the
other. Â« ' r 1 '
Joe Harvey, the well known owner and
poolroom proprietor, proved the success
ful bidder for the field book privilege. . At

as to threaten to batter down the High

allow the students to enter the building
by that passage. Unless calmer counsel
prevails there is a possibility that the

a strike. Superintendent P. E. Perham
promulgated a rule that the students must
enter the Hlffh School building by the side
doors and that only teachers and visitors
are to be permitted the use of the front
door. An indignation, meeting was held
by 1S5 students out of a total of more than
200 and resolutions were: passed demanding
entrance at the front door. This was re
fused and they left the grounds. Only
twenty-four attended school to-day.
To-night a ranfs- leeling of parents was
held, 200 persons attending, but action was
postponed until to-morrow evening. "The
Board of Education also met and passed

Captain McCluskey said that' the Wil

actual existence. It has no buildings, but
it has a full list of officers. All the plans
for the buildir.er and the details of its
purposes have \>een effected, but lt has

CALIF0RNIANS IN WASHINGTON
rROM New York comes the report that society
leaders in that city have adopted a practice of
having the labels washed from champagne bot
tles before they arc placed upon the table. The guests
are thus compelled to judge the wine upon its merits.
I? comes' to them anonymously, as it were, and they
approach it Without prejudice and without bias, '
The object of the fad is said to be that of promoting
the use of American champagnes. It has been the
custom in this coumry to regard* native wines as in
ferior to foreign wines. The label ha9 been more at
tractive to the- consumer than the wine itself. Rich
people who by reason of their wealth have been able
tc direct the ways of i-ociety and the customs of club-s
have delighted in paying fancy prices for anything
.foreign, and have scorned everything American. It
is to put a.n-end to that custom that the reformers
have started the fashion of washing off the labels.
It appears the movement has been well supported,
and now no man or woman in swell society in New
York dares to serve a bottle of wine from which
every trace of the label has not been, carefully re
moved.
. A correspondent of the New York Press in giving
Â£n account of the origin' and the progress of the fad
says: "Ex-Judge Frederick "G. Gedney yeariT ago
Stopped buying Imported champagnes when it was. his
treat, and recently a millionaire in upper Fifth avenue
turned down every champagne agent in this city when
he gave a swell dinner. His wines came from a cel-

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
WHILE other cities of the Union are giving
their undivided attention to politics San
Diego takes time to survey herself and her sur
roundings, to note that all things are lovely, and to
issue an attractive invitation to all the world to come
and share tbem. The invitation appears in the form
of a special edition of the Union, a handsome number
of twenty-four pages, richly illustrated and abound
ing in glowing words from poets, statesmen, artists,
preachers, scholars and pleasure-seekers declaring the
surpassing excellence of San Diego as a winter re
sort.
The invitation of the Union is, however, by no
means confined to winter resorters and pleasure
seekers. It is even more urgent in asking the atten
tion of capitalists and men of business, and points out
the many advantages the city offers for profitable en
terprises in all lines of industry. Thus, after noting
that San Diego is. more advantageously situated than
any other city south of San Francisco and is the
"chief commercial port of Southern California, the
only one having a spacious deep water harbor ade
quate to the requirements of the commerce of the Pa
cific," it goes on to add: "The city has transconti
nental railway connections with the East; It is a ship
ping point also for lines of steamers, some olying up
and down the coast, others to Japan and China,
others to Mexico, and others still to Hamburg, Ger
irany, via the South and Central American and Mexi
can ports. . The commerce of the port, both coast
wise and foreign, has made gigantic strides during the
past two years, and promises to increase steadily."
'The Union has done well in issuing its invitation
thus early in the season. When the election is over
and Bryan has been defeated westward travel will
start up and all prospects point to the conclusion it
will be larger than ever. Doubtless thousands of
Easterners are already thinking of the trip, and the
Union's special edition, therefore, is timely as well as
attractive. San TJiego is to be congratulated upon
having a journal alert to its interests and so able to
advance them.
SAN DIEGO'S ADVANTAGES.
Such is the record of the woolen industry of this
country in recent years, told officially and without
partisan bias. The review gives the history of the in
dustry from the beginning of the Government, and
the samelesson has been taught by even' chaqge in
the tariff. Free trade means ruin, protection means
prosperity.
So much for the wool-growers. Their interests arc
dearly on the side of protection. Now for the manu
facturers. It was argued by the free-trader? that cheap
Â¦wool would benefit the millmen and enable them to
extend their industries. The results proved the argu
ment to be invalid. Th^e report says: "The effect of
the law cf 1894 on manufacturers was scarcely less in
jurious than upon wool- growers. They were not sub
jected to free goods, but were exposed to. a competi
tion under a reduced rate of duty which they could not
withstand, flooding the country, stopping. sales: first
cxh'austing profits, then - reducing wages, *and finally
shutting down mills." Â¦
In 1897 a new tariff was enacted restoring customs
dirties on wool, and at once the prosperity of the wool
industry of the .country revived.. The, report says:
"The value of sheep is nearly doubled. The depart
rrrent estimate of average-value in. January, 1895, was
$1 58 a head, and last January $2 93. - *â¢ â¢ * It ap
pears that XX Ohio, which was # worth 18 cents in
London in l?97, when the Dingley bill was passed,
roÂ«e to to 231-2 cents in the. United States, though our
markets were burdened with an enormous supply
bought on a free wool basis, and next year, when a
relief from this handicap had barely commenced, it
v.as worth 20 cents here and igy 2 cents in London."
Under a protective tariff on wool the number of
sl:ecp in the United States in 1884 was 50.626,626. In
itSSj there was a slight change in the tariff, and in the
ycnrÂ« following Â«evenl revenue decisions in favor of
in:porters. These had a discouraging effect upon
wool-growers, and in. five years they decreased their
flecks by upward of 8.000,000. With the enactment of
the McKinley tariff a new era of prosperity began in
1890, and in four years the number of sheep increased
by ir per cent. In 1894 came tariff legislation making
wool absolutely free, ss well as all forms of shoddy
and waste materials used in adulterations. The effect
was instantaneous. Prices of wool and sheep de
clined, resulting in the destruction of flocks and in
difference and neglect in their care.
A review of that kind is timely and pertinent to the
issues of the present political campaign, for once
more the voters are called upon to choose between
the party of protection and the party of free trade.
Moreover, an official publication will have more
veight with intelligent men than a mere partisan
document could have. It is therefore worth while to
note what the record shows to have been the effect
of the different fiscal policies upon both the wool
giowing and the wool-manufacturing industries.
THE SHEEP AND WOOL INDUSTRY.
rROM the Department of Agriculture there has
just been issued a report on the sheep and wool
industry of the United States, prepared by J. R.
Dodge, formerly a statistician of the department. In
the letter of transmittal prefacing the report it is
stated that the purpose of the department in having
it prepared was "to review the history and development
cf the sheep and wool industry in this country and to
trace the history of our domestic wool in particular,
the variation in prices and- the nature and extent of
fcrrien competition." In making such a review it
was of course impossible to eliminate reference to
tariff legislation and it> general effects on the industry,
but car* was taken "to confine the discussion to the
mere facts with as little argument and theory as pos-

PERSONAL MENTION.
There is a most extraordinary example
of a most extraordinary school to be seen
in one of the local galleries this week, and
it is a rare and uncommon privilege to be
able to see work of this kind so far from
the art centers of the worldâ a Monticelli
subject, "Tho White Horse."
. It Is difficult, indeed, to avoid falling
into the sin of the superlative-" in even
mentioning the existence of the picture.
Says a London critic, in speaking of a
late Monticelli exhibition at the Goupil
Gallery there: "It seems like an excess,
a debauch almost of color, when you first
go in the Goupil Gallery. The splendor
bewilders and blinds you. It is not until
you have recovered from the first shock
and you begin to look at each picture
apart that you are thrilled to the soul
with his 'painted music' He cared for
nothing but color and it would be absurd
to ask anything else from him."
And thai about expresses the impression
of a first look at '"The White Horse," a
splenriid riot of colorâ pure cobalt, pure
vermilion, pure lemon yellowâ the artist
uses with magnificent audacity. He was
a Provencal, like Tartarin or Tarascon,
steeped to the lips in the same brilliant,
absurd, romantic atmosphere of the coun
try of Daudet's hero, and it is all here
on the 21x16 inch piece of mahogany which
holds "The White Horse." One might
almost dub this glorious Gascon the Don
Quixote of the palette, the same splen
dor of imagination transmuting milk
maids into Dulclneas, inns into ancient
castles, barbers into gentle knights, per
vades the work. Perhaps also tbe same
unearthly indefiniteness may be seen, for
though In places" "The White Horse"
shows rare skill of draughtsmanship (wit
ness the superb impertinence of the half
drawn, ...hajf-suggested ligures on the
right), yet one would cry the artist's
mercy occasionally and ask a slighter
strain on the Imagination.
"The White Horse" is the center of the
composition, holding a richly garbed per
sonage of consequence; a dark brown 1
horse immediately behind seems to belong
to an attendant, and these, with two
splendidly dressed women, a baby and a
cleverly drawn hound, are all looking at
a strange, small animal or reptile on the
groundâ perhaps a lizard. The sky behind
is absolutely indescribable. Heavenâ a
Tarascon heavenâ shows . through. The
picture is left with profound regret, and
doubtless when Monticelli is dead enough
(he only died in 'SOâ of absinthe drinking)
a special niche will be reserved for him
in that rather heterogeneously populated
establishment, the temple of fame.
Another original piece of work, in the
shape of a canvas by Arthur B. Da vies, a
new American, Is also to be seen in the
same gallery. A quieter luxuriance of
color, a more subdued . richness of con
ception, a less frank bravado of person
ality, a subtle ideal, is here evident. Mr.
Davies is of the moderns, modern. This
study of swirling, angry waters in treat
ment of wave form so frankly Japanese;
the cliffs interrupting rocks so daringly
adapted to the artist's tonal conception:
the large indifference to commonplaces of
beauty and traditional forms of compo
sition; the slight touch of grotesquerle
evident, again also a borrowing from tho
Japanese: -a lofty disregard of the easy
gossip of the paint brush, and the final
result of peculiar harmonies of line,
tone and color, all point to that which to
day is individual and free, and to-morrow
will be tradition and a new artistic bond
ape.
There is also a fine Keith subject In the
same galleryâ an evening study, with
mysterious depths In the foreground very
effectively relieved by two white-winged
birds homeward bound through the dim
gloom and a shadowy dream figure over,
looking the depths. A threatening sky
overshadows the landscape and a brilliant
break in the clouds on the far horizon
forms the high light of the composition.
The new-old fashion of "book plates,"
for some time now a favorite fad in the
East, has at length reached San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Albertine Randall Whelan for
some time now has been busily occupied
in designing these picturesque addition*
to the library of a connoisseur and some
of her productions are indeed things of
beauty. .
IN THE ART. CALLER I ES.
Such being the condition of affairs in Europe, it
would be an act of the wildest foil}' on the part of thÂ£
people of the United States to elect to the Presidency
the candidate of a party pledged to free trade and de
voted to free silver. Should Bryan be elected there
will be at once an era of tariff tinkering and meddling
and muddling with the currency; and if at the same
time there should come hard times in Europe, With a
consequent flood of cheap goods to be sold in our
markets for gold, the result would be far more dis
astrous than that of the panic of 1893. We are now
in thestream of great events in the business world and
it is no time to swap horses.
A financial crisis in Germany or in Great Britain,
added to industrial depression, would lead to an ef
fort to obtain gold from the United States. Any
thing in this country that implied a willingness on
our part to surrender the gold standard would of
course increase the tendency to ship gold. Thus the
financial crisis in Europe would be followed by an
equal if not worse crisis here.
A condition of affairs almost as ominous exists-in
Great Britain. In fact, it appears the United States is
the only country in the world where there is an as
surance of good 'business for an indefinite period to
come. Our prosperity rests upon solid foundations,
but they are not so solid but what they could be
weakened by bad legislation' or by vicious and in
efficient administration of national finances.
If hard times come upon Great Britain and Ger
many an effort will be made to dump their surplus
goods upon the American market at whatever price.
Should that be permitted our markets would be over-
Stocked, our mills would have to close down and our
workingmen would suffer. It is therefore imperative
that at this time we should carefully guard our pro
tective tariff as the only possible means of preserving
ourselves from the threatened evil. ,
I TNITED STATES CONSUL HANAUER, in
r I a report from Frankfort, Germany, announces
that all business signs in that country point
toward a crisis in industrial and financial lines before
two years have passed. According to his view any
political disturbance of note may bring on the crisis
suddenly and without \varning ; Failures have already
begun in the building trade. The German papers
speak in alarming tones of the sad position of the tex
tile industry. Late statistics of the Gera district show
6022 looms idle out of a total of 11,828. The weavers
still employed there earn but eight to ten marks
($1 90 to $2 13) per week. Shares of industrial com
panies have already commenced to decline, though
the reports of their operations promise for this year
large dividends.

UTTERANCE
Upon a fad of that kind a qualified judgment must
be pronounced. It is undoubtedly,' a step in tlje right
direction. Anything tending to relieve New York
society of subjection to foreign labels is good. .Any
thing which will lead the clubmen of the metropolis to
judge wkie upon its merits and give the American
product a fair show is good. Nevertheless the fashion
cannot be .wholly approved. There is a -sort of cow
ardice in it. Why-should tlie promoters of the fad be
afraid to serve champagne with an American label?
Since they believe American wine to be as good as
that of Europe, why not have the courage of the con
viction and frankly cjfve it without concealment?
Such questions will suggest themselves to all Cali
fornians, for in this State the -superstitious devotion
to foreign labels has nearly vanished, and the host
who is sure of himself and of his company does not
have to serve foreign labels with his wine in order to
feel at ease. Neither does he: feel it necesary to wash
off the American labels. Still, the New York fad will
on the whole be received here with approval, even if
we do not follow it. It is a sign of growing indepen
dence, and the general wish will be that it live and
flourish.
lar in the State of New York, and there were no labels
on the. bottles; but it is a solemn fact that no one of
his guests hung back en that account. So beautiful
was the frappee that all possibility of identification
was removed, and the guests thought they were drink
ing nectar from the chalk cellars of Epernay instead
of a natural wine from up State recommended for its
purity and effervescence by Duncan B. Harrison.
When other millionaires of deep patriotic and eco
nomical instincts got wind of this they tried the
American wine, minus labels, and the fad was inaugu
rated." Â¦ '
Â¦ When the judicial clauses of the Virginia constitu
tion were under discussion John Marshall said to the
convention, in a plea for an independent judiciary:
"The judicial department comes home in its effects
to^ every man's fireside; it passes on his property,
his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not important to
the last degree that it should be rendered perfectly
and completely independent, with nothing to influence
or control it but God and its conscience? I have al
ways thought, from my earliest youth until now, that
the greatest scourge an angry heaven ever inflicted
upon an ungrateful and sinning 1 people was an ignor
ant, a corrupt or a dependent judiciary."
Marshall might have included ignorance and cor
ruption in the one word dependent, for they are in
separable from it: It is such a judiciary that Mr.
Bryan proposes, if he get the power, to destroy,
abolishing that branch of our constitutional system.
His attack upon it is an assault upon our whole sys
tem of government, for, with the prop of an indepen
dent judiciary removed, the whole structure falls in
ruin.
In his old age, while yet Chief Justice, he was a
member of the Constitutional Convention of Vir
ginia. He sat there with Madison, Monroe, John
Randolph and John Tyler.
John Marshall, who was Chief Justice from 1801 to
1S32. put in force the provisions of the constitution by
his judicial decisions. He found the constitution a
blear skeleton, wired together and lifeless. He fleshed
its bones and breathed into it a living soul.
Every writer on the constitution, at home and
abroad, has affirmed that if this Government is to en
dure its permanence depends upon the Supreme
Court. Every expounder of the constitution, Mar
shall, Webster, De Tocqueville, Professor Bryce and
Judge Story, has pointed to that court as the anchor
of the government. But Mr. Bryan desires to de
stroy it!
His idea was that a court should be compelled to
decide according to the resolutions of a mass-meeting
instead of according to the law. His views went into
the Chicago platform, which denounced the right of
a court to enforce its own judgment by proceedings
in contempt. It also denounced, the tenure of the
Federal courts and proposed to destroy it. He
boasted that he woulU reorganize the Supreme Court
of the United States and subordinate it to his will. In
his campaign that year, as now, he devoted much time
to misrepresentation of the courts and appeals to the
people to subordinate or destroy them. He has
omitted nothing, that will foster disrespect for the
judiciary, rouse hatred against it and invoke a spirit
that demands its revolutionary destruction. His
course is an attack upon the constitution, which made
the judiciary a co-ordinate branch of the Government.
To make that branch dependent is to destroy it, for
the makers of the constitution carefully provided for
it? permanence and usefulness by making it indepen
dent. It was intended to be the rationalizing co-
Cidinate of the Government, its duty being to reduce
to reason and to constitutional rules the acts of the
legislative branch.
BRYflN ON THE JUDICIARY.
r~VEFORE his nomination in 1896 Bryan wrote
K^ and published his views on the judiciary.. He
said that the courts should not be independent,
that the judicial branch of the Government was dan
gerous to the liberties -of the people and should be
subordinated to what he calls "the popular will."

Amid a roar of hisses and jeers the
voice of Sir Henry was drowned, but he
continued, waving his arms and shouted
inaudible charges against Sir Charles,
who stood up and In equally heated lan
guage absolutely denied Sir Henry's alle
gations and abused his administration.
Half the time Sir Henry was on his feet
endeavoring t6 interrupt, and the extra
ordinary spectacle was presented of the
president and ex-president of a grant rail
road standing before a howling audience,
both of them shouting at once and neither
speaker being audible. It was -only when
several persons stepped forward with the
intention of hustllg Sir Henry Tyler out
of the room that he ceased speaking.
The meeting then, by a large majority,
approved the directors' plan to reorganize
the Chicago Grand Trunk with a guaran
tee of the interest on the bonds. to be is
sued by the new company.
The meeting also gave Sir Charles a
\*ote of thanks. .
During the course of the report the
president urged the shareholders to perr
slat inMmprovtng the line. He added that
the surplus earnings of the Central Ver
mont road would for the present be ap
plied to this purpose. -'< \.
President Wilson expressed the belief
that the Pan-American Exposition at
Buffalo would greatly add to the busi
ness of the road, but he considered it
doubtful if the expenditures of the road.
In view of the labor troubles 1n the United
States, would be reduced during the com
ing year.
There was a scene of great disorder,
and then there arose a cry, "Tyler H
here." In a moment the venerable figure
of ex-President Tyler was seen walking
toward the directors' rostrum. As soon
as Sir Charles Rivers Wilson recovered
his composure he said: "Tyler, stand up.
You have vilified us. Repeat before us all
the charges you have made."
Cheers mingled with groans - reeted Sir
Henry \V. Tyler, who malntairied that the
Chicago Grand Trunk was owned and
controlled by the Canadian Grand Trunk,
and that, therefore, the directors were
making false pretenses when they rep
resented the reorganization as a trans
action between two independent concerns.
Continuing. Sir Henry asserted that the
scheme involved the repudiation by Presi
dent Wilson of the Chicago second mort
gage bonds, which he asserted were cut
down from 5 to 4 per cent. "Be honest!"
shouted Sir Henry Tyler. "Don't repudi
ate them."

Then there were many vessels bound to
and from the nitrate ports and a blK fleet
that was bound to Europe from Pacific
Coast ports with wheat. Not more
than a dozen of the fleet, how
ever, had masts like the one
seen by the Challenger, which was a
"whole stick." Nearly every Iron or steel
"wind jammer" atloat has a "built" mast.
The chances are, therefore, that the dis
masted craft is a wooden vessel. If the
foremast went by the board; then a por
tion or perhaps all of the mainmast fol
lowed, and the hull .may be now making
its way slowly to some friendly port under
a jury rig. The arrival of the Aryan. St.
James or Bretagne may throw some light
on the subject. All three vessels are now
fully due here.

hnf characterized this market during the week,
but scarcely so much attention has been paid
to the article as recently, owing to the re
quiremer.tf of the dried fruit season. One or
two enu '1 lots have been received per steamer
from America." The Liverpool correspondent
at the tiime paper reports that market as hav
ing a v<Â»ry active consumptive demand, and
the country 1Â« taking very large quantities.
There hare bwn a few shipments from Now

r-f a couple of cars of under prime goods be

are in fnir demand from the regular Jobbing
trad". The market abroad on Jordan ehelle-1

acvar.'.-es. California almonds are firm at
recent higher prices."
"Â¦Quotations yesterday were 12SC on new
Arr.allas and 12c on old. but thp market was
very inactive. An advance in old is looked for
rather than a dropping in -price of new. J^>

Mall advices from New Tork say:
"Trafle Is quite pood in a general way. but
without any special feature of Interest at the

rals'.ns. Some further bu*inÂ»;Â«s in Feedless
muscatels was heard of yesterday at a pre
mium said to have been around 1 cent over
opening price. Considerable doubt Is expressed
In the trade, however, regarding sales of se?d
l"sÂ» muscatels at a reported advance of l%c
and sales of layers at %c per pound premium.
Fuch an advance on layers, it Is claimed. Is
not Justified by the present situation on these

"A prrat deal of Interest is taken In the

which, however, are held very firm. The new

It Is clearly evident, therefore, that New York
will have to make a more urgent call to efteet
a movement hither of gold on any considerable
scale. Meanwhile the local money market con
tinues to harden and the proportion of call
loans placed at 3% per cent was considerably
greater than yesterday. To-day's transfers of
currency to the interior through the sub
treasury again reached three-quarters of a
million dollars and the banks have lest to that
Institution since Friday J2.275.OOO. The move
ment by express Is a matter of conjecture, but
Is known to continue large. Speculative action
was considerably paralyzed pending the solu
tion of these market perplexities and the
movement of prices was narrow and unim
portant. There was a notable movement In
the Iron and steel group, pretty much all the
members of the group coming into the move
ment as the day progressed, with advances of
from 1 to over 2 points. This movement and
the announcement of the engagement of gold
In Paris served to overcome some of the early
depression. Strength In the local traction
group was also a factor. But the maiket
closed dull with few net changes of Importance.
The movement in the bond market was nar
row and irregular. Total sales, par value,
JC80.000.
United States refunding 2s, the 3s (regis
tered) and new 4s declined >i per cent on the

ur>on the outcome of the contest, now Inaugu
rated, for the possession of the available
money supply. The engagement of Â£50.000 in
sold and its withdrawal from the Bank of
England for shipment to New York marked the
beginning of the contest and confirmed yester
day's estimate that sterling exchange at New
York had fallen within the margin of profit
for gold imports. No announcement was made
in New York of this engagement and It was
cemmonly supposed that the withdrawal was
made in anticipation of an advance in the price
of gold, with a view to future shipment. The
withdrawal precipitated an advance in the
Bank of England's price of Â«rold. Rold bars
and American eagles being marked up half a
penny an ounce. The margin of profit on im
ports to New York was thus wiped out. Ster
ling exchange in New York, which had steadied
this morning after yesterday's downward
plunge, thereupon resumed a downward course
and dosed easy and still tending toward the
new level of goM Imports established by the
Bank of England's action. The discount rate
In London also responded to the threat
ened demand for gold and hardened
Flightly. The Bank of France is undoubt
edly best equipped of all the great European
banks to spare gold at this time. But it has
pursued a policy of hoarding for some time
past and the policy of the Institution in the
protection of Its gold reserve Is exceedingly
arbitrary. It is taken for granted that it Will
intert>ose an obstacle to the drain Inaugurated
to-day uj>on the Paris market's gold supply.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 9. â The Commercial Adver
tieer's financial cablegram says: The fall In
American exchange on London caused a weak
opening In the markets here and the close was
flat on the sale of Â£501, COO in German coin and
Â£DO,000 in American eagles. Besides this Â£150,
000 was taken for Egypt. The bank raised Its
selling price for eagles a penny, to 76s 9d.
There was a strong inquiry for gold from Ger
many and America, but the market is holding
out for higher prices. London sold Americans
moderately and Berlin sold Northern Pacifies
and Canadian Pacifies again, but New York
Eteadied the market. Business was very mod
! erate. London thinks New York will advance
! stock prices more on gold Imports and they will
depress them on exports.

Oats played a thinking part on the specu-President J. H. T. Watkinson of the
Contra Costa Water Company^was charg
ed by Kobert T. Hayne this morning with
belnj a criminal who Fhould be condemn
ed to a cell at San Quentin. The corpora
tion offlcia.1 was severely arraictifd by
the city's counsel, -who in his argument In
the contempt proceedings declared him to
l>e a law breaker, a destroyer of evidence,
a burner of account books and a candi
date for a. felon's cell.
NVarly all day was occupied In the argu
ment as to whether President Watkinson
destroyed the water company'* l>o-.Â»ks in
contempt of the orders of JaOgm Hart or
whether be ordered them burned several
months before the present suit was com
menced. Attorney Hay no opened and
closed for the city and Attorneys Moore
ai.d llcCutchen defended Mr. Watkinson.
At the conclusion of the argument
Judge Hart announced that his decision
would he handed down to-morrow morn
ir-C at 10 o'clock. "Without further re
tnaxks he jvostponed the case until that
time. President Watkinson will probably
be declared guiltless of contempt on the
contention that he destroyed the books
months before the commencement of the
suit and while in ignorance of the lm
jK>ndiriÂ£r action.
On commencing his argument this
morning Mr. Hayne went directly into the
question of Watklnson's alleged contempt.
He held that the company not only re
fused the city's experts permission to pee
its books hut had destroyed its records
prior to 1S?9. so the city could not secure
evidence as to the valuation of its plant.
"The Contra Costa Water Company
cornea into court," said Hayne. "and saya
that its books were destroyed in May,
1899, long before suit was commenced.
What has it presented to prove the
truth of this statement? Nothing but the
unsworn statement of President Watkin
son to Van Bokkelen and CranÂ«3all, the
experts. There is no other testimony to
show that these books were not burned
after Jjjdg-e Hart ordered them brought
into court.
"M.r. Watkinson says he destroyed the
accounts. He admits he willfully burned
the water company's books, but he does
not dare to go on the stand and swear
to the truth of his statements to the ex
perts. All we have before us is the un
sworn confession of a man who has de
liberately broken the law and deserves to
be sent to the State's prison.
"It is an unpleasant duty to refer to
Mr. Watkinson In this manner, but a man
who burns books and destroys records
under the conditions that existed when
Mr. Watkinson did so deserves all that
has bern said of him.
"It is rather peculiar that, according to
Mr. Watkinson. the company kept no
Â¦books for three months between May and
August. 1B99. The records, he said, were
kept on loose sheets and destroyed. The
reason jriven was that there was lack of
room for account books. Think of a great
corporation giving such a lame excuse for
tht- destruction of its records.
"It is a presumption of law tbat when
the records of a corporation are destroyed
it is done for a lrftudulent purpose. Cor
porations are required under the State
law to keep their books open to the pub
lic. It is. therefore, none too strong a
statement to say that this gentleman. Mr.
Watkinson. in burning the records of the
Contra Costa Water Company is a law
breaker."
E. J. McCutchen was the first of the
corporation's counsel to reply. He ar
gued that the burden of proof was on the
city to show that the books were, de
stroyed after the order of court was
nadf. He also contended that there were
no grounds on which President Watkin-
Bon could be punished for contempt.
A. A. Moore also took the stand that
there was nothing to show contempt.
"Did I not explain to your Honor," he
asked of the court, "just after you made
the order directing the production of the
books that most of the accounts had been
destroyed?"
Judpe Hart replied that he had been
told of the burning of some of the books,
but allowed his order to stand neverthe
less.
Hayne stated that he also had been no
tified af the destruction of the books and
was asked to accompany Mr. Moore while
that gentleman notified Judge Hart.
"I told Mr. Moore." said Mr. Hayne,
"that he could tell the Judge anything he
pleased, but that I would not be a party
to any such action."
Mr. Moore referred to Mr. Hayne's ar
gument as a tc-mpest in a teapot, and said
he thought the city's counsel was not
justified in referring to President Wat
kinson as h criminal.

WILLIB OLSON SHOUTS
SNEERINGLY AT PRINCIPAL
AND IS ARRESTED.
BERKELEY. Oct. 9.â William Olson, '
the 12-year-old schoolboy who
was arrested yesterday for dis
turbing the peace of E. E. Nich- <
ols, principal of the Lorin school,
was arraigned before Justice Robert Ed
gar to-day. The little fellow pleaded not
guilty and his hearing was continued until
Wednesday, November 7.
The causes of the arrest were these:
After dismissing school Mr. Nichols start
ed to catch a car. As he ran up the street
the Olson lad shouted Jeerlngly at him.
Nichols says he is not positive what was
said, but the boy declares he shouted,
"Nichols, Nichols, old fat pickles." How
ever that may be. Mr. Nichols did not
like the tone, and as It was in tne pres
ence of nis pupils he thought it best to
mnkft an example of the boy. He caught
the lad and Carried- him to his office in
thS school and telephoned for the Town

Nichols let the boy go and got a warrant

place " said Mr. Nichols, "who need look

should be called upon to bear the insults
of a lot of Jeering boys. This was not the
first time that different boys have used*
insulting language toward me. I am not
the only one to complain of this, either.
T am very sorry for the Olson boy. It is
probably his first offense; but as an ex

After the appointments were made the
Civil Service Commission, which had not
been consulted in the deal, appeared upon
the scene. Freud and Quinn voiced a pro
test against the violation -of the charter
that could be heard throughout the con
flm-s of the City Hall. They threatened
all sorts of things if a requisition was not
made Immediately for ten clerks from the
eligible list. Phelan made his usual spe
cious arguments, that serve when he is
making an attempt to evade the charter,
but the commission was obdurate. The
result was that we ten clerks were dis
missed yesterday, by Tax Collector Scott
and they were replaced by ten men who
THAT Mayor Phelan is not a firm
supporter on all occasions of the
civil service clause in the charter
is demonstrated from the illegal
manner in which ten extra clerks
were appointed in Tax Collector Bcott's
office on October 1 last. Scott was author
ized by the Board of Supervisors to ap
point the clerks on the recommendation
of his Honor. With Phelan's full consent
Scott appointed ten men who Â¦were not on
the civil service eligible list of ordinary
clerks. It Is said that some of the clerks
so appointed are members of the Demo
cratic organization, which accounts for
the Mayor being a party to the Illegal
proceeding. The names of the ten clerks
follow: C. Conway, J. A. Mocran, W. K.
Owens, T. J. Lenehan, H. C. McGuIre, E.
W. Blgelow, P. Rodcers. W. E. Boody,
D. F Maher and F. T. McGinney.
Deputy Tax Collector Salomon, In the
absence of his superior, stated that the
clerks in the tax office had no interest In
the litiKat Ion, as the result of the 'ex
amination had not yet been announced.
Sheriff Lackmann said he would not
contribute one cent to the movement, and
was unaware that any of his deputies
were in the scheme.
Assessor Dodge was equally as em
phatic in his denial of any connection with
the latest attack on the commission's
powers. Â¦
The copyists in the County Clerk's of
fice who were superseded are: Thomas L
Doran, John B. Reilly, D. C. Van Nos
trand. J. V. Harrison, P. W. Lannon, P.
A. McGushin, John Houston, Frank
Myers, Oscar Herold, Andrew Harrlgan
and Joseph McAuliffe.
"My fight on that question," said Re
corder Godchaux, "Is over. I take the
stand that the commission should have
been ready to certify to a list of eligibles
for all offices on January 8, as provided
by the charter. Had it. not been so dila
tory all this trouble would not have oc
curred. The charter provides that the
commission shall be appointed by the
Mayor Immediately after the result of the
election is known."
All kinds of rumors are floating around
the City Hall as to the Interests behind
the latest attack on the charter. Record

any connection with the litigation that
has been inaugurated.

Court to-day a civil suit was filed to an
nul a deed of transfer conveying certain
property from Herman Pause to Hedwig,
his wife. Back of the suit Is a tale- of
alienated affections. Some time ago
Pause and his wife resided upon a ranch
near here, the property of Pause, which
he, on his wife's solicitation, transferred
to her. Later J. Franck appeared upon
the scene, was smitten with Mrs. Pause's
charms and. it is said, wrote a letter to
Pause offering him $10,000 for his wife,
signing it "yours respectfully."
Pause declined, but It appears from his
allegations that the proposition was not
altogether disagreeable to Mrs. Pause, for
she transferred her effects to the home of
Franck and also took with her a gun and
pistol belonging to her husband, for which
latter offense she Is charged with petty
larceny. ' - .

HOLD A PARLIAMENT
Justice Morris" decision consisted of a
review of a large part of MacHae's testi
mony. He introduced his remarks by say
ing that he did not consider the evidence
sufficient to support a murder charge.
Justice Morris said:
"The men MacKae attempted to arrest
were guilty at most of a misdemeanor,
and to shoot them was doing something
in excess of authority. To establish self.
defense it would have to be proved that
Brown and his companions, were commit
ting a felony at the time of the shooting."
Justice Morris held that MacRae could
never have run a block between the
wheels of the buggy without falling down.
In concluding his decision the Justice
said:
"The evidence shows beyond doubt that
the defendant arrested these young men
for a misdemeanor and that they got

to the Superior Court that a jury should
pass upon this question.
"It appearing to me that the offense of
manslaughter has been committed and
that there is sufficient cause to believe the
defendant guilty thereof, I order that he

OAKLAND, Oct. 9.â Miss Mae Brit
ton cf Oakland has no desire to
pose aa a heroine before the pub
lic, especially in view of the fact
that she was Quietly pursuing
her duty of caring for the sick at St.
Winfred's HoBpital, in San Francisco,
at the time she Is reported to have
been saving the life of a young man
from the waters of the bay of San Fran
cisco. The story of her supposed act
gained some notoriety in the public prints,
and since that time the young lady has
found herself annoyed by a constant
stream of letters from both^>trangers and
friends. Some of her friends wanted to
compliment her upon her splendid cour
age, and some of the strangers wanted
to see if they could not offer themselves
as objects upon which she might practice
some of her heroism.
This has become bo annoying to the
young lady that she has decided to tell
the public that she Is not a heroine; that
she did not go rowing with Arthur Kim
ball one week ago last Sunday; that the
boat was not overturned and that she did
So Oakland ,has produced one young
lady who does not want any false honors
and who wants to be tnought just what
she Is, with no credit for something that
never happened. -,
*'I was In San Francisco at the time
that all this Is. said to have happened,
and this has placed me in a rather em
barrassing position.' I did not go rowing
with Arthur Kimball, nor any one else,
and would hardly do so without a party
or a chaperone. I. am Just a plain, or
dinary young woman, and not a heroine,
and I am a trifle tired of having the laugh
turned upon me with that kind of a joke.
I want no false colors about me."
"I have no desire to rose as a heroine
in this or any other community," said
Miss Britton. "I have no desire to have
any honors showered upon me. nor to re
ceive any medals or laurel wreaths for an
act that never occurred. Incidentally. I
would like that some of my good friends
who are congratulating me upon having
saved a life do not write too many letters
upon that subject.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 9. â TJiere was a '
large representation! of Baptist
ministers and laymen present
when the twentieth annual ses
sion of the Central Baptist Asso
ciation was called to order this afternoon
at the First Baptist Church by President
Z. X. Goldsby. Eleven churches were rep
resented by delegates.
In the afternoon the session commenced
with a prayer by Rev. R. L. Halsey of
Berkeley, followed by a Scripture read
ins by Rev. E. R. Bennett. The fol
lowing committees were appointed by the ;
chair: Arrangementsâ Dr. Thomas Bald

Vining.
The annual sermon was delivered by
Rev. C. H. Hobart, whose subject was
"Lost Arts In Religion."
"There are many instances of a falling
away from the church and its creed,"
said Dr. Hobart. "There are many arts
in religion that are lost to the people of
to-day. Conviction of sin Is In a large
measure a lost art in religion. Mankind
these days has a decidedly good opinion
of itself. The saddest thing about human
nature Is its self-complacency. Compre
hension of sin comes through a vision of
God. Until the vision of God comes to
you your sin remains as in a deep, black
chasm."
Following Dr. Hobart's sermon came the
address of welcome by the Rev. Dr. S. A.
Taft. In a few chosen words Dr. Taft
welcomed the delegates to the First Bap
tist Church.

You have become free from the break-
ing down force of coffee, and, on the
other hsnd. you are taking a powerful,
noi:rifhmg liquid food which quickly re-
builds the new cells. These are facts â
profound facts, ready for any one to
prove to their own satisfaction by actual
t:se. Postum Food Coffee is made at the
famous pure food factories of the Postum
Cereal Co.. Ltd.. Battle Creek. Mich.,
and is t:sed by brain workers all over
the world. Don't call it a "substitute"*
for coffee: leave out the coffee proposi-
tion altogether. Postum is a liquid food
and a true food drink
Frequently it first shows in dyspepsia,
lack of power of the bowels to operate
properly, or palpitation of the heart or
some other lack of vitality and healthy
vigor. There is but one thing for a sen-
sibie man or woman to do â quit coffee
absolutely. "Hard to do," you say.
Take up Postum Food Coffee, use it
regularly, have it well made, so it
tastes good. You will find a well de-
fined, unmistakable change in your
health, and there is a reason for it.
This breaking down of the little cells
each day, from brain work alone, is a
natural process, and the cells can readily
be built from the riffht sort of food, if
the system is not interfered with by
druffs, but if an increased amount of
cells are broken down by the use of
coffee, trouble then begins.
The fine, miscroscopic particles of
phosphate of potash are found in quan-
tities in the pores of the skin after the
brain has been used actively. This must
be replaced from food, or brain fag and
nervous prostration sets in.
Any brain worker that depends on
thought for his success in life uses up
daily, by brain work, a varying amount
of the delicate particles of phosphate of
potash and albumen of which the brain
and nerve centers are composed.
And Watch It Carefully.

evening calculated to bring them nearer
to the closing of retail stores every secu
lar evening Saturday excepted, at 6
o'clock. In the first place they appointed
Sf*w VwSh PFeS ? com â¢ittee. consisting
of w. T. Hobson, James A. Johnston and
Leo Kautaann. They also selected two
delegates, James A. Johnston and A E
Rowe, to represent them in the Labor
Council. They also admitted twenty^etail
clerks to membership and received appli
cations from thirty-live others. This In
dicated the growing strength and popu
larity of the movement. The press com
mittee, having thoroughly considered the
situation, reported at the close of the pro
ceedings last evening that the chance for
success was steadily Improving. Firms
that have been closing at 6 p. rn. are con
tented with the arrangement. Others
were expected to follow suit.

A. C. Schweinfurth. an architect, who
formerly resided in this city, passed away
at Dryden, X. Y., a few days ago. The
news of his demise was received by his
friends with great surprise, as he was
known to be enjoying the best of health.
For the last two years deceased with his
family has been residing In Italy and
France and but recently returned to New
lork. His early life was spent in Boston
where he received his training in the of
fices of well-known architects. Afterward
he removed to New York and was asso
ciated for a time with the late A. Page
Brown. Mr. Schweinfurth removed to
Denver and later came to this city, where
he again became associated with Air
Brown. In the work done in this city un
der his own name deceased showed him
self to be a man of great talents and of
exceptional individual ability.
His efforts were directed toward the
adaptation to the needs of our time of the
suggestions to be found in the Spanish-
American architecture of Mexico and in
our own missions. Among the buildings
designed by him are the Hearst building;

Captajn Joseph M. Callff. Third Artil
lery, with two employes of the quarter
master's department, has been detailed to
examine Into the condition of the horses
lately purchased under contract for the
artillery branch of the service
McArthur was taken to a nearby ward
to have his wounds dressed and Borden
was Incarcerated in the guardhouse
None of the wounds were serious but
McArthur will remember his encounter
for several days, as they are very pain
ful. An investigation of the matter will
be held and Borden will be tried by court
martial. The-'Offense is a serious one and
he will probably receive a severe sentence.
Two acting assistant surgeons, two hos
pital stewards and two acting stewards
in charge of. a. detachment of seventy
hospital corps privates from the school
of Instruction at Fort McDowell, will sail
on the Grant on the 16th lnst. for Ma
nila. Three female nurses will also sail
on the vessel. Owing to the large number
or patients at the general hospital it has
been found necessary to Increase the force
of hospital attendants by the addition of
twenty privates from the school at Fort
McDowell.
It seems that the men were having an
argument, in which Bor.den -was worsted,
and losing his temper he attempted to
Btrike McArthur, but only succeeded In
knocking off his hat. McArthur protest
ed against such treatment, and in reply
Borden called him a number of uglv
names. This was more than the corporal
could endure, and dropping his crutches
he grappled with Borden. Borden drew
a penknife from his pocket and jabbed It
repeatedly into McArthur. Despite the
fact that he had -the use of but one leg
McArthur succeeded in throwing his man
and held him until the arrival of the at
tendants.
The spectacle of two soldiers, one great
ly emaciated through sickness and the
other hobbling around on crutches, en
gaged in a fierce struggle was the sight
that greeted the attaches of the ganeral
hospital at the Presidio yesterday shortly
after noon. The men engaged In the
struggle were Corporal McArthur of the
Seventh Atillery, being treated In the
hospital for a gunshot wound In the foot,
and Private Horace D. Borden, who was
operated on a short while ago for ap
pendicitis.- When separated it was seen
that McArthur was covered with blood,
and on examination eight knife wounds
were found, one on the back and should
er and the others In the neck.

The task of selecting a man In every

The lasters contended that If the shoes
had to be handled as the firm directed,
the watering of the channels being done
with an oil can, the firm should employ
a boy, because the time taken by the men
to do this work would cause a loss of pay.
The firm was willing- to employ the boy
needed, so Mr. Gallagher reported yes
terday, and the :; difference to be ad-
Justed was only 2 cents per dozen pairs of
shoes. Considering this, Mr. Gallagher
believed that a settlement could soon be
effected, possibly to-day. ,
An evening paper published yesterday a
statement that the men who walked out
might boycott a large, retail house. This
was denied absolutely by Mr. | Gallagher,
who said no such move had been' even
considered and he had no idea where the
rumor originated. To bring about a boy
cott the Labor Council must be asked to
act. That had not been done.
Buckingham & Hecht and their em
ployes were nearer a settlement of their
differences last night than at any time
since the walkout of the employes.
Humphrey Gallagher, the business man
ager for the employes, said last evening
that the firm had reinstated Fred May
senholder, the laster who was discharge.1
last week. Maysenholder is the financial
secretary of Shoemakers' Union No. 216.
The only point of difference remaining to
be finally considered was that referring to
the matter of the dipping of the shoes.

Alice denied that she sang while she
poured the water on the rats. She only
sang at homer and in church, she said.
Mrs. Carranza said she told her daughter
to kill the rats by use of boiling water.
Professor G. Wanrell testified that the
hot liquid cure for the rat evil was in
vogue in Rus=ia and Spain.
A. Fodera. the poultry dealer, was called
as an expert on the killing of fowls and
small animals, and Armstrong asked him:

Catherine Uatour Alleges That Caro
line Ford Got Possession of La
tour's Property Unfairly.
Catherine Latour of Montreal filed a bill
In equity in the United States Circuit
Court yesterday against Caroline Ford of
Scott Valley. Cal., and a number of bank
ing corporations to restrain her and them
from making any disposition of the money
and other property of Felix I^atour, who
died in Lake County on May 25, 1899 leav
ing upward of $20,000 in the banks named
as defendants.
The bill recites that Latour was the
husband of Catherine Latour. that he de
serted her and went to California"; that
he resided with the defendant Caroline
Ford, who was not related to him by
blood or marriage: that he, being para
lyzed, was wholly dependent upon her for
support, comfort and the common neces
saries of life, and that he was completely
dominated by her. The allegation is made
that within a few days of his death Caro
line Ford procured a man named Craw
ford to write upon the bank books an
order requiring the banks to pay to Caro
line Ford all of Latour's money on de
posit, and that she persuaded Crawford
to sigrn the name of Latour to the said
orders, and to hold Latour's hand with
the pen In It and guide the dying 'man's
hand in making his mark. It is also al
legpd that by her procurement Crawford
signed Latour's name on the back of a
note for $S00 which had been given by her
to Latour, secured by mortgage on her
property. After Latour's death the bill
goes on to state, Caroline Ford was grant
ed letters of administration in the Supe
rior Court of San Francisco.
CANADIAN WIFE SEEKS
TO OBTAIN AN . ESTATE
ALECOS REMOAL, who is said to
be a scion of a rich and prom
inent family in the Argentine Re
public, is wanted by the police to
answer to a charge of grand lar
ceny. The warrant was sworn out yes
terday in Judge Fritz's court by Chris*
Machado, a barber at Fifth and Howard
streets, who befriended the youth and
says he was repaid by the basest ingrati
tude.
Remoal Is 26 years of age and is distin
guished looking. He came here about four
months ago and registered at the St.
Nicholas Hotel. He had a lot of trunks
with him and was able to run up a heavy
bill at the hotfil while spending his monoy
foolishly in the tenderloin. When the
hotel people reminded him that he should
pay his bill he acknowledged that he was
practically without funds, but expected
Remoal was In a strange city without
money or friends, and in his desperation
he sought work. He got employment as
dishwasher in cheap restaurants and was
thoroughly disheartened when he met Ma
chado. He- told the barber his circum
stances and Machado took pity on him.
Ho told Remoal he could stop with him
until he got his remittance from home.
That was last Sunday. Machado took Mm
to his room, and early Monday morning
when he awakened he discovered that
Remoal had disappeared and had substi
tuted his greasy clothes for Machado's
good ones. In the pockets of the trousers
was $49 10, which Remoal carried away
with him. Machado waited till yesterday
in the hope that Remoal would return,
and then he decided to have him punished.
a heavy remittance from his parents.
That did not suit, and he was told to seek
quarters elsewhere. His' trunks were de
tained at the hotel as security for his
bill.
Lpshur arm Wills were both taken to
the Central police station and locked up
in the tanks. The shooter will not be
charged until the result of Haugen's in
juries can be determined. Wills is de
tained on account of his connection with
the affair. Upshur evidently went back
to the concert hall looking for trouble as
four extra cartridges were found in his
pockets by Detectives George McMahon
ana Jerry JMnan.
Upshur was formerly an actor and is
also known under the name of Stewart
Harold.
Upshur says, the woman who accompa
nied him is his wife. He claims that after
the first disturbance In Fischer's she was
ejected from the house. This act so en
raged him that he sought revenue. He
brooded over the matter when he return
ed to his room, and finally concluded to
get satisfaction. Wills was to accom
pany him. but the latter remained some
distance behind and was not present when
the shot was fired. As soon as Upshur
entered the concert hall he took the pro
prietor to task and another struggle en
sued. It was then the Â»>!stol was dis
charged.
Mrs. Doble is the oldest daughter of
"Lucky" Baldwin. She was divorced
from her husband some years ago. Doble's
second wife is now suing him for a di
vorce in. New York City.
Nothing more was thought of the In
cident, but about 12 o'clock Upshur ap
peared in the foyer of the hall brandish
ing a revolver. He was immediately con
fronted by E. A. Fischer, the manager of
the place. A struggle ensued for the pos
session of the weapon. Officer Haugen
rushed to the assistance of Fischer. The
revolver was discharged and Haugen re
ceived a bullet in the left breast. He
held his assailant with bulldog
strength and eventually secured posses
sion of the weapon. Upshur was then
taken to the police patrol box, where he
was turned over to the regular patrol
men. Haugen was conveyed to the Re
ceiving Hospital in a hack. His wound
was found to be over the leit breast. The
bullet was extracted without much diffi
culty. It proved to be of 3S caliber. It
entered the body just above the heart and
glancing on the ribs came to the surface
near the spine. The wound is not con
sidered dangerous.
Brown Haugfen, a special officer em
ployed at Fischer's Concert Hall on
O'Farrell street, was shot but not danger
ously wounded by Stewart Upshur in' the
foyer of the establishment last nigrht
shortly before midnight. Early in the
evening: Upshur and H. W. Wills, former
ly a piano player at the Tallac House, ac
companied by Mrs. Henrietta Kreling and
Cora Doble, the divorced wife of Budd
Doble, the horseman, both of whom re
side at the Baldwin Annex, visited the
concert hall. The men were reprimanded
by the management for their noisy and
boisterous conduct and were requested to
leave the hall. They did so and as Up
shur left the building ho remarked to
Special Officer Haugen that "he wished
he had a gun and if he could get hold of
one he would return and fix him."
