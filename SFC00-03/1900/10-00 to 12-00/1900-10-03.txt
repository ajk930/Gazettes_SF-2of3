Mr. Manley says: "This estimate doss not place Indiana in
any column, with its fifteen votes. The fight in Indiana will . ba
closer than in any of the other States, but with the thorough or
ganization which Republicans have in that State and with, the pop
ular ticket the chances Â»re very largely that these votes will be
found in the McKinley column, which 'would give 281 electoral
votes for McKinley and Roosevelt. The committee is work!ng with
a purpose to give McKinley and Roosevelt 312, as against the
271 votes received four years ago. Kentucky, they firmly bslieve,
will go Republican, but they know full well that the chances
are that the Republicans in that State will be counted out."

Among the dealers who paid their
money and did not receive their tax
stamps are the following: . ' .
The affair Is considered to be of such
seriousness that the men who paid their
Â¦ money and did not receive their stamps
threaten to demand an investigation from.
Washington. It is not particularly the
amount of money Involved In these trans
actions which Â¦ has created the scandal,
but the reflection of acts which indicate
what the rest of the administration may
fce. It Is not 1 Improbable in view of what
has happened, that the same carelessness,
irregularities and mysterious evaslorrs
"may have had their effect In other parts
of the State. Of this, however, the angry
license payers of Stockton, of course,
know nothing. They only know that Col
lector of Internal Revenue Lynch" has
their money and they have not received
the stamps for which they paid: Over
Â¦three months has passed and they are
still â¢ seeking vainly for satisfaction.
There could be then absolutely no mo
tive for. theft, on the part of postal em
ployes, and further than this, postal em
ployes are not anxious to tamper with
envelopes which bear the frank of the
Federal Government and are sent on offi
cial business. The investigating authorities
laugh at Lynch's claim that the stamps
were lost in the mail. They say it would
bo -a very curious mishap, -Indeed. . if
more than a dozen different official letters
sent to as many different addresses r-ould
all be lO3t or missent. The letters never
entered the mail, the' investigators say,
and Postmaster Montague says he- is
ready. to bet $100 to ten cents that they
Rever. left the office of Collector of In
ternal Revenue. John C. Lynch. And
Postmaster Montague has conscientious
scruples against making a bet in which
there is a chance to lose.
No Motive for Theft
transaction. Lynch has ' deliberately
shifted the blame to the postal au
thorities, and in this endeavor he has
raised a storm about hts head. The
postal authorities have made a most
searching investigation and they declare
that it is absurd to Insist that the stamps
ever entered the mall. The inspectors
and Postmaster, who resent the effort of
Lynch to throw unmerited guilt upon
them, express their belief that the
stamps which have disappeared so mys
teriously and which represent hundreds
of dollars, never left the office of John.C
Lynch. The postoffiee . authorities refer
significantly to the fact that these stamps
possess a monetary value only while they
are in the office of Collector of Internal
Revenue Lynch. When the stamps leave
that office they are of value only to the
person to whom they are addressed. *
"It will be noticed that Collector Lynch
had placed a deputy in charge' that day.
Perhaps railroad politics or the fancy of i
his political masters commanded the-pres
ence of Collector .Lynch somewhere else
than in the place fn which the Federal
Government pays him to remain. But the
satisfaction of the deputy was cheerless.
The Stockton dealers did not receive their
tax stamps, the postoffice inspectors found
no letters' that had been lost, strayed oi^i

am In receipt of your favor of the ltfth inÂ»l.
and find on, consulting our record that all
the speciaj tax stamps mentioned' by ycu
were issued on the' 25th ult. and mailed in
due course to the parties for whom they
were made out. I have had other com
plaints from Stockton that stamps- mailed
at the same time were not received by the
owners, and have therefore reported the
matter to the postofflce Inspector, who has
promised to give the matter his immediate
attention. As soon as I hear from .him I
will write you again, though you will
probably hear direct from the inspector
who visits your city. Respectfully,

They employed an attorney to look after
their interests and on July 15 Collector
Lynch received a letter from this attor
ney, who demanded that' his clients, re
ceive that for which they had paid. In
answer to this letter Collector Lynch
wrote that- the licenses had been issued,
but that they had been lost '-in trans
mission through the malls. His epistle in
which he gave this unsatisfactory and
discouraging explanation for the delin
quencies of his office was as follows:

tiently for their tax stamps, but the val

been busy -doing railroad politics, dancing
servile attendance on Herrin or fulfilling
his destiny as the factotum of the Mexi

SCANDAL has once more entered
the office of the Collector of In
ternal Revenue and the gossips
in the Appraiser's building haw
something new with which to
keep their tongues wagging. The latest
offender in this hoodoo office Is Collector
John C. Lynch, he of bogus telegram ill
fame. The office of Internal Revenue has
been the scene of more serious scandal3
than all the others in- the local Federal
service combined ami this latest stain
upon its record will not contribute
to Its reputation. Forgery, theft, sui
cide, crimes various and Infamous
have marked the history of the office and
now accusations of Â£/oss neglect, care
lessness and irregularities are added to
the indictment. Reputations have been
unmade in the devious routine of this de
partment of national administration; and
now wise heads in- the big Federal build
ing are speculating on what next will
come out of the shadows of the place to
startle the public.
; Responsibility for the latest scandal In
the service of the Federal Government
rests solely upon the shoulders of Collect
or John C. Lynch. He has attempted to
shift this responsibility to the postal au
thorities, but after a thorough and abso
lutely exhaustive Investigation. Robert R.
Munro, Postofflce Inspector-in-Chief. and
TV. W. Montague, the Postmaster of thi^
1 city, emphatically declare that the blam>i
belongs to Lynch and to no' one else.
" The affair is of more than usual seri
ousness, as Jt has to do vrlth the very
department, in which I^aac Norton found
tempting financial ruin and " a suicide's
death. It Is the . department through
which the administration of Welburn was
overwhelmed, in shame and 'dishonor. It
Is the department In which scandalous
frauds have lurked and in which many
thousands of dollars have been â¢ stolen
from the National Government by thiev
' Ing officials and unscrupulous employes.

â¢ In the. latter part of June several sa
loon-keepers and -druggists of Stockton.
â¢ Undine, Lockeford and Linden sent to
John C. Lynch, Collector of Internal Rev
enue, several hundred dollars with which
to purchase special licenses. They shou'.i
have received from Lynch the tax stamps
for which they had paid, but they have
since received neither money nor stamps,
although they have been persistent in de
manding what belongs to them and have
employed counsel to represent them in de
fending their rights against the singular
conduct of Lynch, and the peculiar admin
istration of his office. They, have sent let
ter after letter and nave received only the
cheerless Information that the staxnps
"have been lost. ;
In seeking to hush comment and pro
tÂ«Â«t over the mvsterious and irregular
Collector John C. Lynch Js the' center of the latest scandal in Federal affairs in this city. He is
accused of gross carelessness and irregularities in the administration of the internal revenue scnice, and
his accusers threaten to demand an investigation from Washington. Sci'eral liquor dealers and drug
gists of Stockton and other parts of the State have paid for their licenses and have not received them.
Lynch received the money and pleads that the stamps zverc lost in the itiails. Chief Postofficc Inspector
Munro, who made a thorough investigation, bcliars that the stamps never, left the office of Lynch. Post
master Montague is emphatically of the same opinion.

emphasizes the story with the earnestness
of great conviction. When asked to-night
in regard to the story Kipgman admitted
he had Information which goes to prove
that Bryan supported silver because palJ

family. She. exchanges visits every year
with Bryan's sister, who is also th?

Bryan and the silver question. .
This young Woman, who Kingman
says Is the daughter of one of the best
families of Jacksonville, and whom he
can produce If necessary, stated that
while she was at the Bryan home a week
before the convention a delegation of five
men from Colorado, representing the sil
ver Interests of that section, called up->n
Bryan and made him a business propo
sition. They told him If he would in3!st

Bryan, and his stand before the national
convention was based upon his agreement

Inspector Munro's Opinion.
Under the direction of Inspector"Munro
a most searching investigation was made,
and the inspectors are convinced that the
letters were never mailed and the stamps
were never, sent to their purchasers. In
the first place it Is absurd to believe that
more than twelve letters sent to moro
lia i l twelve .different addresses miscar
ried. There ha 8 never been such a mis
hap under such conditions In the history
of the postal service. The stamps were
Inclosed in official -envelopes, with spl
ciflc directions to return to the sender
within a specified time. They had the
Government frank and were thus doubly
protected If they had been missent : by
the postal authorities the mistake would
have been discovered long ago and they
would have reached their proper destina
. If these letters had been misdirected bv
any careless : subordinate of Collector
Lynch the error would have been detected
and rectified even if the letters had been
sent to any part of the American conti
nent: It should be remembered that thre
months have passed since the stamps
were supposed to have been mailed. Onlv
one other contingency remains: the
stamps may have been stolen by some
dishonest. mall clerk. But the T postal â¢!
spectors call attention to the fact thai
there could have been no possible motive
for theft, as the stamps were valueless to
everybody except to him to whom they
were addressed. The Investigators havn

ters and stamps had been lost in the mail
This was on July 19. many days after
Lynch knew that the Stockton dealers
should have received their licenses. He
had issued the stamps, he says, on June
25. On July 7 he had been informed
that the licenses had not reached their
destination, only a few miles away. Yet
he waited until July 19 to Inform the pos
tal Inspectors that the valuable papers
had been lost in the mails.
Intemaf Revenue lapped Into silence.
ILynch's Reply to Complaints. .
Asaln the attorney, for the dealers wrote
to Lvnch. and this time the Collector hap
pened to be in Ills office And answered in
uerson He repeated .that the stamps had
been lost in the. mail and that in a few
davs' he would issue receipts for the
money sent.'. by .the dealers in payment.
His letter was as follows:

The attorney was not the only anxious
one in the party, f On July 7 one of the
Stockton merchants became so thoroughly
disgusted at the irregularities of Lynch s
office that he wrote in his own oehalf.
Collector Lynch did not take the trouble
to answer the Indignant dealer untM July
SI v.'hen he wrote and inclosed a certifi
cate which he said "will answer the pur

Certificates in Evidence.
But Collector Lynch did not find peace by
?hrowine blame upon the postal au
thorities. The Stockton dealers did not
intend to be thrown off by vague ex
planations, and Indefinite, unkept prom
ises. They were operating without li
cences and were amenable to the law.
They were likely to suffer for irregulari
ties for which Lynch was responsible.
They therefore demanded some imme

Lvnch the following certificate, in which
Lynch again seeks to evade responsibility:

SG ANPAL IN THE OFFICE
rl OF COLLECTOR J. C LYNCH
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â President
McKinley will return to Washington' on
Thursday or Friday morning to confer
with his Cabinet relative to replies to be
made to the two new propositions sub
mitted by Germany and France, j Ger
many Is understood to have gracefully
withdrawn from the position she assumed
in the note addressed to the powers sev
eral weeks ago. In which she insisted that
the responsible authors of the outrages in
China should he surrendered to the- allies
as a condition precedent to negotiations.
This proposition was only favorably re
ceived by Italy and Austria, but was not
assented to by any one of the other pow
ers In the meantime the Imperial Gov
ernment of China issued a decree direct
ing the degradation of Prince Tuan , and
four other princes and the trial of Tuan
by the Imperial Clan Court. The first of
ficial information concerning thi= decree
was given to the powers by faheng, Direc
tor of Railways and Telegraphs at Shang-
Iii her new note to the powers Germany
abandons her position of Insisting upon
the surrender of the guilty to the allies
before negotiations can begin and has sug
gested that the time is ripe for the powers'
to consider these two propositions:
That the Ministers. representing the pow
ers In Peking designate the responsible
authors of the outrage, whose punishment
will be insisted upon. Â¦
That the powers determine upon tne
character of punishment that shall be ex
tended to the guilty.
It is understood that the note was pre
sented to Secretary Hay through Baron
von Sternberg, who called at the State
Department this morning. I Baron von
Sternberg has been handling the German
case with much astuteness and delicacy
and he believes that a misunderstanding
exists on the part of the press of this
country as to the aims of Germany. He
insists that by the declaration of Baron
von Bulow more than three months ago
Germany as well as every other power is
pledged to the maintenance. of the territo
rial Integrity of China. It is believed in
official and diplomatic circles that as a
result of Germany's practical abandon
ment of her original proposition the con
cert of the powers will continue unim
paired unless some" other development
The French proposition- the administra
tion regards as a mixture of good and evil.
This Government readily assents to the
declaration that the instigators of the
outrages and leaders of the Boxers should
be punished, and It is In favor of Imme
diate negotiations, and would like a .set
tlement of all questions pending with
China as rapidly as possible. But there
Is ro reason to believe that this Govern
ment will assent to the suggestion that
the powers agree to prohibit the Importa
tion of munitions of war intothe- celestial
empire or that it will agree to establish
a permanent guard in Peking. . /
An official who discussed the < French
proposition to-day said that the United
States did not propose to enter into any
agreement to kill an industry which was
highly profitable and keep out of China
arms and ammunition which might he
needed for the purpose of suppressing an
insurrection. It was pointed out that
tha-powers themselves had practically
forced China to buy the extensive arsen
als with which she is now equipped, and
that the Chinese would be deprived of the
reward of their own thrift if the manu
facture of munitions, in which they have
shown decided ability, should be stopped.
With respect to the- maintenance -of a
permanent force In Peking it is -said by
officials that thl? Government proposes to
retain a force for Mr. Conger's protec
tion only so long as it seems necessary,
and that Â¦ certainly .- nothing will be done
to- make Peking a permanent post for
American troops. â¢ â¢-Â¦Â¦Â¦ : '
It is unlikely that the United. States will
care to resolve the Ministers In "Peking
into a star chamber body and indicate
persons whom they consider responsible
for the outrages, j At the same time the
Ministers are the only ones who are
capable of determining who are respon-'
slble, and this is:a strong point of the
German proposition.

-BERLIN, Oct. 2.â The following -Is the
text of the Ghinese Emperor's, message
to Emperor William of Germany:
OreetlnKâ That your Majesty's Minister has
fallen a victim to the rising which suddenly
broke out In China, without our. officials being
able to- prevent It, whereby our friendly rela
tions were disturbed. Is deeply deplored and
regretted. By decree we order that sacrifice be
made on' an- altar for the deceased and Chief
Secretary Kun Yang has been Instructed to
pour libations on the altar. The commercial
superintendents of ; the northern and southern
ports have been ordered ' to take the needful
measures concerning the conveyance of the cof
fin of the deceased. -When it reaches Germany
a second offering shall be made on an altar.
Germany has always maintained the > friend

tertain : the hone that your Majesty will re
nounce all resentment Â¦ so. that peace may. ba
arranged Â¦ as soon as possible and that unl-

most ardent -wish. Â¦ - - . . -. Â¦
Emperor "William replied September 30
a3 follows: ' . ' â¢ - :.
To the Emperor of China: I. the Emperor
of Germany, have received the. telegram of
your Majesty, the Emueror-of China. I have
observed with satisfaction that- the Emperor
of China Is anxious to expiate, according to the
custom and precept of your religion, the shame
ful murder of niy Minister which set . at
naught all civilization, yet. as the German
Emperor and. a Christian, I cannot regard that
abominable crime as atoned lor by a libation.
Besides' mjr murdered Minister, there have gone
befcre ' the throne of God a large number of
our brethren of Christian faith-. Bishops and
missionaries, women and- children, xrho, for
the sake of their faith, which Â¦ is also mine,
have" died the violent death of martyrs and are
accusers of your Majesty. Do. the libations
commanded by your Majesty suffice for all
these Innocent ones? .1 do -not- make' your
Majesty personally responsible for the outras"'
against the legations, which are held Inviolable
among all nations, . nor for the grievous wrongs
done so many nations- and faiths and to the
subjects of your Majesty of my Christian be
lief. But the Rdvlsere of your- Majesty's throne
and the officials on whose .heads rests', the
blood feuilt of a crime which fills all Christian
nations -with horror Â¦ must expiate- their abom
inable deed. When your Majesty brings them
to the punishment .they have deserved, that
I will regard ns an- expiation which will sat
isfy the nations of Christendom. . . â¢
If your Majesty will use your- Imperial 7 power
for this purpose, acceptlng'to that end the sup
port of all the Injured nations, I, for m j part,
declare myself agreed oh that point. I should
also /rladJy welcome'- the return of. your'Ma

Marshal Ton Waldersee. will be Instructed not
only to serve your Majesty with the honors .due
your rank, but .he will afford your Majesty .the
military protection you may desire and which
you may need against thÂ« rebels. .
I also lone for the peace, which, atotws : for

and which offers to all foreigners. In China

State Election.
Expect a Big Majority in the Georgia
DEMOCRATS ARE , CONFIDENT.
It was my good fortune to be In Congress a
short timeâ Just a little while, but I would not
take a treat deal for my experience there. In
all that time I did .not see one single farmer
asking for legislation, but I saw lots of fellows
who asked for legislation against the farmer.
In the hearing: before the Ways and 'Means
Committee I heard' It stated that only one
farmer appeared, and he lived near enough to
Washinston so he could walk down. But the
great corporations had their lobbyists there.
You attempt to get* a bill through to correct
unjust railroad rates ond you will find a lobby
thore. You attempt to reduce the tariff on any
jjiing and you will find a lobby there. You
talk to Republicans about the tariff and they
will admit that some rates are too high, but
whenever you attempt to lower the tariff on
a public thing you will find that the producers
of that thing are Just on the verge of bank
ruptcy and you cannot afford to take the tarlfX
from it and after you get all through you are
lucky if they don't raise it.
It Is the tendency to hurrah for anything
Republican that has made the farmer bear the
load that ought to have been borne by other
people. The Republican . party to-day is put
ting upon the great producing masses burdens
that they ought not to. bear and-: is relieving
organized wealth from burdens which It ought
to tear. // - .-. '. Â¦ _.:'."Â¦' "rp-.
I think that a government that was good
enough for the forefathers Is good enough foi
us, and if that- means old fogy, I would rather
be an old fogy American than new fogy Amer
ican. I believe that we have drawn to our
selves the best " blood of nations. We have
brought to our shores those who have come
here to seek the liberty which they could not
find at home, and if we in this latter day
depart from the principles of the fathers; if we
repudiate the -principles' that have drawn these
people to our shores then we will be guilty of
deceiving them, and those who have come here
under the delusion that they were coming: to
a -republic wili have Just ' cause for an action
against the Republican party for breach of
promise if It converts , the republlo Into an
empire. >-^;
Speaking especially . to the farmers at

Speaking at Rochester Mr. Bryan re
ferred at some length to the foreign-born
citizens, saying in part:
I was told this mornlns that you had here
a larce dairying interest ana that led me to
look up the" statistics on the dairy produce.
You have been told that under this adminis
tration there has been a wonderful Increase in
our expert business. I find from a Government
report that the exnort of butter has fallen off
in the last three years and the export of oleo
margarine has Increased during; the last three
veanÂ« Let me give the figures. In 1896 we
exported 25,690,000 pounds of butter: In 1SS9 we
exported 20 247.000; in 1900 we exported 1S.2G2.000.
Fhcwlnc a falllne off of more than 7,000.000
pounds in the last three years, while oleomar
garine Increased ns follows: In 189?, 13,000.000
pound*; In 1S99. 14.000,000; In 1900. 15,000,000. Aivi
I find thf- total export of butter to the Philip
pines for the year ending June, 1900, was worth
J1&04 ?o I Huppose that this country produces
a good many times as much butter as this na
tion f xported to the Philippines, and if you
will flcure up your proportion of $100,000,000 a
vear raid for a Btandine army you will under
stand how much you i>ay to get a chance to
export ?19O4 worth of butter. When I was look
ing this question up It was suggested to me
that while the export of butter had fallen off,
the things the butter-maker needs have risen

LA CROSSE, Wis., Oct. 2.â When -Mr.
Bryan concluded his last speech here to
night* he had made eighteen addresses and
had covered about fifteen hours of time
during the day. Beginning at 8 o'clock in
the morning he talked at intervals. until
11 to-night, putting in all told fully six
solid hours of speechmaklnp. , The first
speech was made at Shakopee and after
that appearance he spoke in succession
at the following places: Jordan, Belle
plaine, Henderson, Leseuer, St. Peter,
Mankato-, Janesville, Waseca, Owatoona,
Dodge Center, Kasson. Rochester, St.
Charles, Winona and three speeches here
to-night. Most of the talks were com
paratively brief, not running over ten
minutes, but at St. Peter. Mankato,
Rochester. Winona and at this point hs
spoke at greater length. Almost all tha
meetings along the line were held In the
Immediate vicinity of the railroad stop
ping places, thus saving much of Mr.
Bryan's time and giving the people more
time to listen to his remarks. The region
traversed to-day is a rich agricultural
section and Mr. Bryan's remarks were ad
dressed especially to farmers, the trust
question receiving even a greater share
of attention than usual. The . audiences
were large as. a rule. There were espe
cially good crowds at Mankato, Owatoo
na Rochester and- Winona, and at thin
place there were three large apdlences.
He was met at the station here by a
large concourse of people but by no or
ganization. He was driven rapidly to the
rink, where he made his first speech here.
He then spoke at Germania Hall and the
opera-house. All three of these buildings
were fliled.
At Owatoona Mr. Bryan discussed the
dairy Interest, saying:

Mr. Bryan Puts in Six Solid Hours of
EIGHTEEN SPEECHES IN A DAY
The resolutions indorse the Kansas City
platform as the expression of the ancient
doctrines of Democracy, a recurrence to
the fundamental principles proclaimed In
the Declaration of Independence and em
bodied .in the constitution. The con
struction and supreme control of the
Nicaraguan canal by the United States
Government was urged.

DEMOCRATS MEET AT BOSTON.
PLATTSMOUTH, Nebr., Oct. 2â Ihe
demonstration this evening in honor of
the advent of the Vice Presidential candi
date was full of noisy good nature and
vim. Everybody was out and the lighted
streets were filled. Fireworks and torches,
trumpets and drums, brass bands and
miscellaneous sounds made speaking dif
ficult, and the Governor made one or two
efforts to start and then waited for the
noise to subside. A thirty-minute speech,
the eleventh since morning, finished the
flow of oratory for the day.
Governor Roosevelt continued: "He puts
the question in good faith and I will try
to answer in good faith. .The trusts at
present have to be dealt with each State
by Itself. A denunciation of trusts is of
no value when not connected with action;
Democratic denunciation of trusts
amounts to nothing- when Mr. Jones,
chairman of the Â¦ Democratic National
Committee, is at the, head of the cotton
bale trust, and when Mr. Croker, the
leader of the New York Democracy, has a
large ownership in another. These facts
convict them of Insincerity, and that is
all there is about It."
Governor Rooseveltâ Shall I tell "you
about Chairman Jones* cotton bale trust
or Richard Croker's ice trust?
AVhile delivering his speech at Aurora
Governor Roosevelt was interrupted by a
seeker after truth, who cried:
"Whatabout the trusts?!'
Governor Rooseveltâ What trust do you
mean? /
Inquirerâ Oh. the Ice trust, beef trust,
oil trust and all of them.
pealed also to the young men who were
casting their votes for the first time or
second time to -cast them for the party
which has always been working for the
honor of the flag and for the greatness of
the nation.
There - was a large crowd at Grand
Island to meet the arrival of the special
this evening. The Governor left the train
and -spoke from' a stand a dozen blocks
away in the center of the city. He pre
faced his remarks by calling, attention to
the present prosperity 'of. all -classes and
asked his hearers to compare- conditions
now with the economic conditions of four
years ago. arid act accordingly. He ap-
Â¦ After the procession had passed In re
view,- Governor Roosevelt was conducted
to a speaker's stand, -where he addressed
as many asms strong voice could reach.
Fewer of those present heard his speech
than of those who did not hear it. He
needed a megaphone to . address all who
were there. .- He- spoke for three-quarters
on an hour, going over the same ground
in his. remarks that he has traveled over
before upon the issues of expansion,, mili
tarism, imperialism and patriotism. His
remarks were punctuated by frequent
cheers. At the conclusion of his speech,
on his way from the stand to his carriage,
he was fairly mobbe.dby a wildly eager
crowd who wished to shake his hand or
to get a .word or. look of recognition. He
reached his carriage somewhat battered
in appearance-,- but in fine spirits on ac
count of the extent and the fervldness of
the reception. The train pulled out for
Plattsmouth, where an evening meeting
was held. The. evening meeting at Platts
mouth was also a great success in point
of numbers and interest. This -meeting
closed the day's itinerary.
One of the amusing features was a
'double-headed calf, the skin stuffed with
the tail on the head, with this motto:
"The result of fusionâ it died.".
Â¦ Another-: ''Eight more years of the full
dinner-pail; four for McKlnley and then
four fox Teddy."
A German c!ub. passed bearing aloft a
dinner-pail with bread and sausage.
The Lincoln Traveling Men, 300. strong,
bore this banner: "Vim, . Vigor and Vic
tor}'-" " - â¢
ners displayed were amusing and others
were significant. One marching column
bore this banner: â¢ -
"Third Nebraska: Oh, Bill, why did you
leave us-?" - Â¦ ' â¢ Â¦
The (Tnion Veterans' Republican League
of . some 150 members was carrying a"
horseshoe for luck. They had a banner
bearing this inscription: "We helped Ab
raham Lincoln in 1S60. We are' helping
McKlnley now."- â¢ '.
Another banner read: "Four generations
for McKlnley -and Roosevelt, father, son,
grandson and great-grandson." Â¦ .
. Another read: "For sÂ«ile â One enlarged
front porch. ' W. J. B." . ' "

ter of the late CoIUs P. 'Huntlnpton, lose
the millions left to her in. her foster
father's: will? The question has been
raised by the discovery .that alt record
of her adoption has 'apparently been lost.
Search for this record has been made In
the Recorder's office at Sacramento. Cal.,
but no trace can be found of the papers;
It Is. understood that a search- in. New
1'brtc among Mr. Huntington's papers was
equally fruitless. H. E. Huntington, an
other of the heirs, is said to be having
the search made. The provision for
Princess Hatzleldt In Mr. lluntington's
will is specilic and whether the loss .of
the papers of adoption win affect her
claim or not is not known here.
SACRAMENTO.- Oct. 2.â According to.
the statement of Mrs. Clara F. Prentice,
uho lives at 3401 L, street in this. city,
her daughter, the Princess Hatzfeldt, was
adopted in this city by C. P. Huntington
and his wife when the Princess was one
and a half years of age. At the time of
the adoption Huntington's wife was the
sister of Mrs. Prentice. After the death
of Mrs. Prentice's sister Huntington re
married. MrW Prentice says that she
remembers that her daughter was
adopted either in 1S63 or 1SG4. about the
time Huntineton went to Washington to
raise money with which to build the Cen
tral Tactile Railroad. Huntington and
his wife wanted to change Mrs. Pren
tice's child's first name, which was Clara,
but the mother -would not give her con
peat, but was willing that the child's
second name should be changed from
Ix>ul?a to Elizabeth. Mrs. Prentice says
that she remembors very distinctly having
f igned the adoption papers. The Hunt*
inctons Were always endeavoring to nnd
a child that would suit them, but in many
Instances were not satined with the so
cial status of the parent or parents. Hunt>-

Hale's.BERKELEY. Oct. 3.â The large buiiaing
on KUtrldge street, near Fulton, known as'
the German Clubhouse and occupied by
eleven students of German extraction,
was destroyed by flre at 12:30 o'clock this
morning. The students, who were asleep
tt the time, escaped, but their effects were
11 burned. -â¢
That none of the occupants of the struc
ture lost their lives Is probably due to- the
action of Postmaster O. C. Vincent of
Berkeley, who aroused them In time to
permit their escape. Mr. .Vincent was
awakened Â¦ by the unusual glare and saw
flames bursting from the roof of the club
house. He ran to it, and by kicking vio
lently on the door aroused some of the
young men, who In turn aroused the
others.
The building was owned by S. C. Dun
ning of San Francisco. It was vcJued at
$7000. The value of the furniture was $3000
Nothing was, saved, the occupants having
barely more than enough time to escape
with, their lives. ...... ...

"My view of the situation can bÂ«Â»st be
expressed in .the propositions that Mr.
Bryan represents European and not
American democracy, and that the worst
forms of Imperialism and of protection
are embodied in the socialistic theories
that have taken possession of the Demo
cratic organization."
"I will freak." Mr. Highton said, "from
the standpoint of Joffeieonlan Democracy.
My fundamental political opinions remain
precisely what thr;y have been durlnc my
flftv-one years of residence in this State.
In 1*96 I declined to advocate the Chicago
platform with its Popullstic annex, but I
didn't vote for McKlnley.* This yeai I find
It Inconsistent with my views of the his
tory and destiny of the Democratic party
to Indorse the platform adopted at Kan
sas City, which has reasserted' what I be
lieve to be the heresies of 1S96.
Mr. Highton. declined yesterday, to state
at any' length his reasons for 1 advocating
the election of McKlnley. saying tha.t he
would forbear such statement until his
public address.
Colonel George Stone, chairman of the
State Central Committee, heard lately
that Mr.. Highton had said to friends that
he riÂ»>t only could not support Bryan, but
also thai he believed the best Interests of
the countmy would be served by the re
election <W President McKlnley. Colonel
Stone went to the attorney and the latter
consented to state his reasons for his po
sition in a public address.

and insist on shaking hands with him.
The men from Pittston had a float with
four men representing "coal barons." They
were drinking what purported to be cham

miners dining on bread and water. A
stretcher was carried containing a dum
my representing a miner who had Just lost
his life in a mine.
President Mitchell reviewed the great
army of marchers on the river common.
He was generously applauded by the
marchers. Business was at a standstill
In the city all the afternoon. The super
intendents of the coal companies and their
clerks viewed the parade from their of
fice buildings. One coal man said it was
a very creditable demonstration. .
It was after A o'clock when the last of
the marchers swept past President Mitch
ell ' Then he and his colleagues were
driven to West Side Park, .where the big
mass-meeting was held. For several hours
a crowd had been gathering there, and it
was estimated that nearly 20.000 people
were massed in front of the stand when
the labor president began his speech. The
reception he got from the vast crowd was
most enthusiastic. ' Â¦
In opening his speech Mr. Mitchell as
sured the strikers that In their fight they
command the respect of the clergymen,
that they have the sympathy of the public
and that the press of the country has said
In one voice tnat their cause is a righteous
one. Â¦ -
"The greatest strike In. the history of
the world." he said. "Is drawing to a
close. Already the great coal carrying
railroads have agreed to , Increase your
wages 10 per cent, which Is a great victory
in Itself. True, it Is not enough, 'It does
not satisfy us; but the time Is not far dis
tant when the sinthraclte coal' miners will
receive as much for their labor as any
other class of in the world." ;
"Continuing he urged the miners not to
place absolute talth In their. president or
any other one man, but to put their faith
in their organization. Standing together,
he declared, they would win their battle,
and he predicted that they would > stand
firm and .the victory would be achieved..
The national president was followed by
Fred Dllcher of Ohio, Benjamin James of
Pennsylvania, . both " members i of the ; ex

Special Dispatch to The Call
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 2.-
President David Starr Jordan in a lecture
to-night told the students of his trip to
the Orient last summer and gave his Im
pressions of the Asiatic peoples and cus
toms. Incidentally he- touched upon the
present troubles in China and commented
upon tho actions of the different nations
represented there.
President Jordan Is of the opinion that
the Dowager Empress sided with the 6ox
ers In their fight against foreigners and
that the 'Government could "' have sup
pressed the rioters with little effort Had
the effort been made. He could find no
excuse for the looting of Tientsin and the
imperial university.
In China, said Dr. Jordan, the mission
aries were the maligned and detested class
of foreigners. This was because they
neither played poker nor drank, hence
those who did indulge In such pastimes
were against them. A few missionaries
who*, were guilty of . dishonesty or inca
pacity incurred the hatred of the Chinese
for all qf them, in closing Dr. Jordan
said: ' v;
' China as a nation has undergone a sort of
vivisection. Her fertile peninsulas have beÂ«n
cut off. her harbors appropriated, and the doors
to. rer trade forced open. For this no com
pensation has been maile to her. China should
not be rejrard<*d entirely as a chance for eco
nomic tr.iln. What she needs is sympathy and
help, that she may restore peace and develop
aftrr her own fashion. One way for Amerl
eans to develop trarle there .would be to eenfl
a corps of honest and sober Consuls, who could
win the confidence of her people. . Nor should
we expect Indemnity, though we are entitled
to.lt. We cannot hope to get money. To take
laml would be but to Justify the Boxer move
ment. - Furthermore, it. would be a losing
proposition financially. The civilized nations
must cease to look upon the empire as a Jelly
fish nation and Join In helping her to work
out her own salvation.

TACOMA. Oct. 2.-J. H. Cobb has
reached Juneau.from the Porcupine dis
trict with news of the first results of the
occupation of the disputed territory by
Canadlan officers. Cobb says many Amer
ican miners have already left and others
are going.. They prefer to leave rather
than go to the expense of attempting to
secure title -to their' claims from the Cana
dian authorities. ' Some of these claim
holders have boon at Atlln. where they
became -thoroughly disgusted with Cana
dian red tapo and the disposition apparent
.there; two years ago to exclude Americans
from mining, righti?. Those men left Atlin'
for Porcupine, feeling certain that they
were going to American territory, where
they -coul-d mine at peace under American
protection. Now they- are bemoaning

notice that title to nil claims legally
Staked by Americans would be confirmed

not a single claim was presented for con
firmation. This resulted from the. exodus
of miners holding claims on Boulder and

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 2.â Judge Torrance
to-day -'rendered a ' 'decision'' in a 'suit In
vblving a tax title which is of Importance
to-all of the property owners of this. city
whose property Is affected by any of the
sales made, in the last three years for
city taxes.. The eult was brought to quiet
title as against a tax certificate and deed,
and after a two days' trial and argument
the decision was in favor of the plaintiff,
the tax certificate title being declared In
sufficient on four grounds. .-Two of the
grounds are specific In this case, but the
other two are general. . .
The court holds that the printed form
which has been in use. for three years is
defective In that it doeÂ»' not state defi
nitely the amount .paid, by the. purchaser
for the tax certificate; and, further, 1 that
it did not.6peclftcally, state at what tlrro
the .property might be redeemed: As all
certificates issued since 1897 have been on
the' eame form*, the decision affects all
titles o( the last three years.

HOLL1STEK. Oct. 2.â Hack of the suit filed to-day by Mrs. Kate Carmack praying for a divorce from George Carmack
and a division of the community property there is a romance that'goea back to the discovery of the Klondike and the gold
fields that have enriched scores of adventurous treasure seekers. Carmack is the man who first took yellow metal from
the frozen soil of that far northern land. His claims on El Dorado and Bonanza creeks are now worth $1,000,000, and he
has many thousands of dollars deposited in the Bank of California, the Hibernia Bank and the Bank of Seattle.
George Carmack spent fourteen years in Alaska, and at the end of that period he was no richer than when he first went
north in quest of adventure and fortune. Then he took unto himself an Indian wife. This squaw had promised him that
she would lead him to a land where gold nuggets were as plentiful as the sands on the seashore. After they had been made
man and wife according to the rites of the rude frontier she kept her word, and with her two brothers, known us Skookum
Jim and Gagish Charley, led him to the now famous Klondike. ;Â¦'.."*;.Â»â¢
Within two years he was a millionaire, and on his return to the States the lowly treasure seeker found himself a prince
among men. fawned upon by his fellows and with the power to gratify his every wish. Then he tired of his Indian wife,
and last February he left her and their 8-year-old child In this city and returned to Alaska.
The divorce decree Is asked for on statutory grounds, and a Mrs. Saftlg of Seattle Is named as co-respondent: â¢

man to show up. Suddenly the astute detective saw a man
who 'answered the description of the mysterious stranger, ap
pear from behind a clump of bushes and start to mount a bi
cycle. Cautiously approaching him, Crockett was about to
seize him from behind when he discovered that the "bicy
clist" was Captain Wittman. With the bashfulness of a
schoolboy Crockett explained that he had been sent by Chief
Sullivan to find out "\vlÂ»at he was doing," and incidentally to
establish the identity of the "mysterious stranger." Mutual
apologies were exchanged and Crockett returned to the City
Hall, where he made a report to Chief Sullivan of what hart
happened.
Wittman now declares that he will learn to ride a bicycle
even at the cost of his position. He, however, has changed his
"training quarters" lo Ingleside, where he will not be subject
ed to the gaze of detectives and prying strangers. He says
that after he learns to ride he intends to have a bicycle built
for two, so that he can take Chief Sullivan for a "spin"
through the park.
CAPTAIN OF POLICE WITTMAX ia determined to
lead his fellow captains in introducing innovations in
to the police department. He believes that every cap
tain of the force should be able to ride a. bicycle, but
before bringing tho subject to the attention of Chief
Sullivan and the Police Commissioners he Intends by constant
practice to be able to sit on a wheel without falling off. For
the last week, eariy mornirg visitors to Golden Gate Pat it
have been startled by a tall man trying to master the difficul
ties of riding a wheel. As soon as they would approach the
man would disappear behind some tree and remain there^ un
til the inquisitive visitors left.
Anxious to establish his identity, the Superintendent of the
Park notified Chief Sullivan of the strange antics of the man,
and requested him to detail a detective to run him down.
Armed with a pair of spy glasses and with his feet encased
in a pair of noiseless shoes. Detective Crockett, better known
as "Old Ironsides," was sent to the park to solve the mystery.
Ensconcing himself behind a tree, Crockett waited for the

THE WAKE OF NOME STORM
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 2.-
The work of explaining the purposes of
the Stanford constitutional amendment
Is being carried on vigorously by those
having It in charge.- To-day the chairmen
of the county committees met and dis
cussed ways and means. Nearly- every
county in the State was represented.
Funds to carry on the work are to be
raised. by contribution from students and
faculty and by a monster entertainment.
This Is necessary because of the decision
of the president of the board of trustees
(S. F. Lieb) that the university would
not cohtrlbute a cent toward the expense
of the campaign, as that would lay it
open *o the charge of lobbying for- Its own
interests.
F. V. Keesling *9S has been chosen to
visit the graduates and friends of the uni
versity, and his expenses have been gua
ranteed by the members of the committee

THE steamer Columbia while mak
ing port frcm Astoria early yes
terday .morning came into cr.M
tsiop with the ferry-boat Berkeley.
The latter was just leaving the
Esn Francisco ?ide on her 6 a. m. trip for
the/ mrie when the Columbia cam* along
under a slow bell. The Columbia had a
hole about seven feet deep nipped out of
her bow. while the Berkeley's was
out through to the huh abaft the davits.
The blame for the disaster will be fixed
by the Inspector* cf Hulls and Boilers.
As rear as can be learned the Columbia
was makir.c her way to her berth at Spear
street wharf. Captain Doran was In com
mend and had his vessel well in hand. Off
Meijrgs wharf he slowed do*n and g-ave
*iis regular communication to the Mer
chants" Exchange reporter.
Getting- under way again the Columbia
cp.me up as far as Jackson street wharf
under a "slow bell" and then the engines
were stopped. At the time (.6 a. m.) it was
almost slack water, the flood tide just be
ginning to make. With her own mo
mentum and the first of the Rood the Co
lumbia had a food headway, but the cap
tain- of the Berkeley thought he could
overcome It and failed.
The Berkeley. Captain "Jim" Blaker,
Railed shar;j on time for Oakland. Leav
ing the slip she blew one long whistle and
Captain Doran on the Colombia at once
answered. This signal mÂ«r:u;t that the
Xer.-yrfcoat Â¦would pass right along and the
cnfcwer of the Columbia meant that she
\vouM take an inside passage and give the
Berkeley the right of way. As soon as
Captain Blaker got clear of the slip he
patv that the big mail steamer was too
close to escape, so he blew two whistles
and backed his engies. By this time the
engines, on the Columbia were also going
full sp<ed astern. The Berkeley was run
r.!ng with her helm "hard a port" instc-ad
of "hard a starboard. " however, and the
re5iilt was the collision. The Columbia
struck the ferry steamer just aft of the
deckhouse on the port side. One of thÂ©
lifeboats was smasned and the guard was
cut In â¢ clean to the hull. The Columbia
was caught a* In a vice, and as the. two
ves=els swung together a piece about eight
feet square was cut out of her bow as
though by a pair of nippers.
The Berkeley v.-as taken off the run ajÂ«
poor, es the Newark- was got readv for
service. The George W. Elder will take
th? Cciurr.bia'9 place on the Portland ruiv.
There wtre very few passengers on the

lumbia <iid not know a collision had taken

The injunction is sought by Andrew
Haes of London and ether stockholders,
who allege that although the estate of
Jay Gould owns only some 70.000 out of
265,000 shares of the capital stock, it has
been controlling the election of directors
by the use of proxies, so that minority
stockholders did not secure their lawful
representation on the board. It was
urged that similar unfair action was
planned for the meeting of to-day. What
had been made the basis of the agreement
to postpone the argument could not bo
learned. It was said, however, that Mr.
Gould and thp Now York directors haft
not yet left the city for St. Louis, and
that the agreement probably involved a
postponement of the annual meeting.

At this point an adjournment was taken
until to-morrow.
"You had transactions of $50,000 with
Reid and Flags and you can't tell us any
thing about them?" asked counsel.
The witness in reply to a question ad
mitted that he received $100,000 from Cap
tain Carter, hut he said he understood tb*
money came from Greene.
The witness said in an excited way
when counsel taunted him on his im

dent in a man's life when he Is accused
of being a thief. You know that
I am innocent and that these statement.-*
are lies made oecause I refuse to
be implicated."
"I never said a word." he retorted, "un
til after Captain Carter's sentence was
confirmed and he was in jail. I gave my
books and papers to my counsel for inves
tigation after your Him had accused me
of being a partner with John Gaynor." .
Witness denied that he was ever a part

The programme was varied, there being
speeches, recitations and songs. When
Bryan's- number was readied the secre
tary leaned Â¦ over . and whispered . In Gov
ernor Thayer's ear. "W. J. Bryan."
Governor Thayer arose and Bryan ad
vanced j toward him. The | former seemed
most cordial, and it pleased Bryan to
think that the Governor was not harbor
ing any malice. because of those campaign
speeches made against him. Governor
Thayer shook Bryan's hand warmly, as
he asked softly:

"DO YOU SING OR SPEAKP"
Venezuela is at last coming out of its trance and
fca5Â«erting its. normal conduct of affairs, Twentv
prominent statesmen of the republic have been thrown
into prison on a charge that they were plotting to
upset the Government.
â¢r If the. local Democratic row continues with thÂ»Â«
bitterness in; which it has begun, something much
more serious than a pictorial representation of the
Morgue is likely to figure in the quarrel.
Southern Pacific officials insist the recent
.Utah Â»Teck is absolutely inexplicable"!* The strangest
part of the affair is that the company was practically
indecent in its haste to pay damage claims.
Our Mexican neighbors who tore down the stars
and stripes the other day may have reason to leain
that Uncle Saranas a peculiarly emphatic way of re
senting such pleasantries.
The dominant principle of the local yellow sheet
has evidently struck in upon itself. Its discussion of
political affairs is superlatively jaundiced and dys
peptic -
Thus far, then, all is going well, but it is to be re
membered that where the calamity. is vast the help
must be on a corresponding scale.' The needs of
Galveston remain. The season of rains and winds is
approaching, and thousands of her people are with
out shelter. Let there be a renewed and spontaneous
effort to make our liberality equal to the demands' of
charity and humanity. The cry for assistance comes
up from a stricken people. Let us respond to it. ;
It is to the credit of the American people that the
stream of contributions for relief has not yet ceased.
Even the increasing excitement of the Presidential
campaign has not led generous, men and women to
forget the dread disaster that has befallen Texas', nor
the importance of providing ample relief before the
coming of winter. , Each day adds a considerable
amount to the fund. Many who have already made
liberal contributions find means to give still further
help, and others who have hitherto neglected to mani
fest their sympathy in a practical way follow the" ex
ample of the generous neighbors.
THE, APPEAL FROM GALVESTON.
1 I ROM Galveston comes a further appeal for
I help. It appears that the sums thus far con
* tributed for the relief of the sufferers ,in the city
and along the storm -swept coast have been far from
sufficient for their needs. John Sealey, chairman of
the finance committee of the Galveston Central Re
lief Committee and custodian of the funds employed
in relief work, reports that the total amount of money
received by him to October 1 was $781,043. Comment
ing upon the report the Galveston News says: "The
pressing need of Galveston is money with which to
shelter more than 8000 people now homeless and to
make habitable the homes of many others. Some cor
respondents have sent out statements to the effect that
millions of dollars have been, contributed for the re
lief, of Galveston â one published statement fixed the
amount at $15,000,000. These statements have led the
public astray and have had a tendency to check the
impulse to give because it seemed the requirements
had been met. But the real truth is that Galveston
has up to date received only $781,043 63, a sum but
little more than sufficient to bury the dead, remove the
debris, accomplish the work of sanitation and to pay
the expense of food and clothing, which the relief
committee had to buy before supplies of food and
clothing began to arrive from the outside world. And
in this connection, with a property loss of $20,000,000,
Galveston is called upon to iace a problem of rehabili
tation and to provide for the housing of more than
8000 homeless people."
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
COAL LANDS-W. A. S.. Lebec. Ca!.
The United States law says "that any
person above the age of 21 years who Li a
citizen of the United States or has de
clared his intention to become such, or
any association of persons severally quali
fied as above, shall, upon application to
the Register of the proper land office,
have the right to enter by legal subdi
visions any quantity of vacant coal lands
of the United States not otherwise appro
priated or reserved by competent author
ity not exceeding lfiO acres to such indi
vidual person, or 320 acres to such asso
ciation, upon payment to. the receiver of
not less than *1Â«>- per acre for such l:tml-Â»

than fifteen miles from any completed
railroad, and not less than $20 per acre
for such lands as shall be. within fifteen

BORN AT SEAâ C.. Fresno,. Cal/ A
child born at sea la a native of the coun
try represented by the flag â¢ which the
ship flies. If a boy is born at sea on
.board a ship flying the colors : of tho
"United States he is a native of. tnÂ© United
States, but not necessarily a citizen theee
of. particularly hi case the father of the
child is an alien. When the boy reaches
his majority- he is at liberty to elect which
citizenship he will adopt â that of the
country of- his birth or that of hia father,
should that father during the minority ct
his son not have become a citizen of the
United States. If the father was a citizen
of the United States at the time of birth
on shipboard then the son would be a full
fledged citizen as -well ss native.
CONSUL-C.. Fresno. Cal. A Consul
must afford relief to seamen or others
wrecked on the coast, and at public ex
pense procure them the means of return
ing home, and take charge of effects saved
from such wrecked vessels, in the ab
sence of an owner or legal representa
tK*e. In the ease of the wreck- of a ves
sel V)f which the crew -was part American
and part English the American â¢ sailors
would claim protection from the Ameri

at which they landed, and" the English
sailors from the British Consul. . \

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Â¦:Â¦} '\\'c. shall; hot. take the trouble to remind the reader
which of these judicial candidates have been nomi
riaiedbythe Republican and which by the Democratic
coiveritipni Â¦ It rriatters not by whom they were nomi
'Â¦Â¦rjate'C. \ It suffices that they are among the good men
whom the bosses of the two parties felt compelled to
pul-upon their ticket for the sake of winning some
t^ing. sit least Q r popular approval. They are good
TOerr; they are able lawyers; they will be just Judges.
T^o -their hands the people can safely intrust all liti
gjation that arises from the conflicting interests of
business and the trial of all charges affecting either
person or property. .Upon that ground they are pre
sented to the. public as candidates entitled to the sup
port of. all citizens who are willing to help maintain
the judiciary above parties and to preserve our courts
Â£-j temples of impartial justice.
'. vtt. is." hardly liecesfary to point out to intelligent
rneri how .irnportarit it is to the community that the
Judges Â«f our courts should be free from any taint
of polhicil T>ia^: They should not be in any way sub
ject to .bosses or to parties. They should be con
scious that .they owe their election solely to the con
fidence, of the; people in their integrity, and that they
are .not in ..any w-ay under obligations to individuals

v Of its -own motion The Call had already rccom
rnended the election of these judicial candidates, and it
4 s safe to say that many a citizen exercising his private
judgment had decided to support them even before
.The Call had spoken. Thus the action of the Citi
r.zetis" Republican Convention comes as an approval
aTidconfirmatipn of the public choice. That it will be
aV potent help in. bringing about the election of the
chosen candidates is beyond doubt, for it will recall the
attention of thousands of Republicans and of Demo
crats to the fact that in the election. of Judges partisan
considerations should have no weight with the voter.
The soje: thought of each sliould be that of selecting
judges, w;ho upon the bench will worthily fulfill the
important duties of that high office.

gratified at the action taken by the Citizens*
Republican Convention in recommending for
election as Judges of the Superior Court M. C. Slos^,

and, for the short term, Frank H. Kerrigan. The
ticjvct thus made up has been selected from the candi
dates; of both parties. It is in no sense a partisan
ticket; \o party question was considered in making
the; selections.. The choice in each case was the result
solely :<>f. a patriotic desire to promote the election of
Judges who would uphold the best traditions of the
American bench and maintain with impartial justice

President McKinley is a man of mature age and
ripe and varied experience. His keel was laid on an
Ohio farm, back in pioneer days, and he underwent
all the hardy experiences and instructive contacts with
men Ahich'equipfor good and sound judgment. He
entered the army when a boy, packed his musket
in the ranks and won his promotion in action. It is
Mr. Woolley's opinion that he is a monster, and it is
Bryan's that he is another monster. According to
Bryan he is making everybody poor, and according
to Woolley he is making everybody drunk.
Much and well based sympathy is felt for all efforts
to save men from the effect of abuse of their appe
tites. Appeals for temperance in all things never fall
upon deaf ears. Even the intemperate deplore the
passion which holds them in its grip. But so far in
the world's experience we believe it to be demon
strated that men cannot be made moral nor temper
ate by artifice or by coercion. The saving principle
must be in the man himself. His self-denial and self
respect are the sole statutes upon which he must rely.
Coercive laws and regulations are inadequate to the
result sought. The more men are taught in this mat
ter to rely on artifice external to themselves the
weaker they become. Prohibitionists deserve respect
for one reason â they have the courage of their con
victions, and they put up a fight against alcohol,
whether the enemy appear as 3 per cent of beer, or
o per cent of dry wine, or 55 per cent of whisky.
They use just as big p. club in the fight against his
.1 per cent form as when they encounter him in 55
per cent redeye.
But so far when people have anywhere assented to
their theory and have put it into the law they have
failed to reduce it to practice. Maine has prohibition,
but the people are as far from being total abstainers
as the dry citizens of Arizona.
Mr. Woolley is stirred to outcry against the can
teen in the army in the Philippines. The testimony
of the officers and surgeons is that whisky, gin and
brandy are fatal in the tropics. No canteen, no beer,
no light wine, no post clubhouse for the soldier there;
he seeks whisky, drinks it by the dipperful and dies.
The Filipinos make a liquor which would make
whisky itself drunk and give gin an enlarged head
It is what tiswin is to an Apache and bolinka to a
Hun in the coke region of Pennsylvania. If beer and
light wine, whisky, gin and brandy are cut off from
the soldier in the islands he will fill him with this
native budge. The lightest thing it does to him is
to make him crazy. He joins the Bedlamites at
once. He becomes on oven; he is barbecued to a
turn by the fires within him. He runs amuck. All
the narcotics combined are in that tipple. It is
hasheesh, opium, cocaine, tobacco, betel nut and
chloroform combined. Whisky runs away fright
ened and hides when it appears.
Now if Mr. Woolley will tell just how to deal with
this Filipino lightning he will fill a long-felt want.
When the soldier can resort to his canteen he doesn't
want this enemy to put into his mouth and steal away
his brains, and his stomach, liver and lights with
them. Given his beer he retains his contents and is
content. Just why President McKinley should be
beaten for not throwing this stuff down the throat of
cur army in the tropics is what no sober person can
We have no doubt that Mr. Woolley could
go to the Philippines, not touch beer nor wine !n the
canteen nor tan his interior with this native lush, but
slake his thirst with the slough water of the region,
and all honor to him for it. But the army has not suc
ceeded in enlisting such seasoned teetotalers. They
are in the more congenial business of fighting
King Alcohol at home. Therefore, may we remind
him that all men are rot made alike? We must take
the army as we find it and do the very best that can
be done for the plvysical and moral welfare of the sol
diers. So far the canteen is a long step in advance
upon the deadfall. Let us not denounce and abolish
it until we find something that will surely carry the
soldier another step away from the place of hard
drinks and not send him backward to the gin bottle.
AR. WOOLLEY, Prohibition candidate for
President, is determined v to show Messrs.
Bryan and Roosevelt that they are not the
only peripatetic platform pebbles on the beach. He
has a special team, too, a marching club and a brass
band, and proposes raiding Illinois and surrounding
States throughout the campaign. One unexpected
demonstration of his tour is that his crowds equal
Bryan's at the stations and enthusiasm is by no means
lacking. Mr. Woolley's special object of aversion is
the army canteen. He thinks that President McKin
ley should be defeated at once, before election, if pos
sible, for not abolishing the canteen.
The army canteen was adopted as the result of ob
servation by the officers of the drinking habits of the
enlisted men. Nfar every army post there are plenty
of saloons, of the "deadfall" variety, where hard
drinks, of the hardest kind, are, available. With these
the soldier was in the habit of soaking his military
clay until it was wringing wet. The custom was
inimical to discipline, to the health of the soldiers, to
the morals of the arm)'. The question was how to
reform it. The officers, being also men, concluded
to try reform by adapting conditions to human na
ture. Being human themselves they put themselves
in the place of the, enlisted men and from an intro
spective study of the situation concluded to apply the
club principle to it. They advised the canteen, which
is nothing more nor less than a post club. In it soft
drinks are sold, beer and wine being the hardest in
the lot. These are of approved purity and- excellent
quality. With them the soldier can get a lunch, and
in the canteen can play social games.
The system satisfies his thirst for something be
sides the post water, which is generally bad. He gets
no brandy nor whisky, nor other fire water. He feel?
himself a gentleman, and responsible for the good
order and good name of his club. Without the can
teen he will go back to the deadfall, the drugged gin,
the debauchery and debasing associations, from which
he has been rescued. Vet Mr. Woolley has convinced
himself that the canteen is dragging the army and
the navy, the Government and the people, hellward,
headlong, at a pace chat beats the record. He wants
to beat McKinley because McKinley won't beat the
cr.nteen, and to that beats his drum up and down ths
tend and threatens to beat Bryan's record as a wan
dering evangelist of woe.

UTTERANCE
Mr. Loud's "ability" has been conceded in Wash
ington by friend and foe alike. Indeed it has been
charged against him that his ability has made him
"dangerously" successful in controlling postal legis
lation and promoting measures of interest to his dis
trict. He has been charged with ability to give his
district the best and most extensive system of rural
mail delivery in the United States. He has been cred
ited with ability to procure for San Francisco im
provements in its postal service disproportionate to
the size of the city; he has been charged with ability
to obtain appropriations for his district and his State
which others could not get; and when he addressed
the editors of the metropolitan newspapers in New
York in advocacy of postal reform with respect to
second class mail matter, and convinced every one of
them that he was right upon the issue and they were
wrong, he was even accused by Senator Butler of
being a hypnotist.
It is to the credit of Mr. Henry that he has not
joined in these personal attacks upon his opponent.
He appears to be conducting a candid campaign. He
admits he is not opposed to prune trust, or to
any other trust of which he is a member. He has no
objection to protection for prunes, nor for any
other produce of an industry in which he is engaged.
In short, Mr. Henry repudiates the Bryan platform
so far as it relates to free trade and trusts. He con
fines his talk mainly to "the paramount" issue, and
when he speaks at r.ll he speaks of "imperialism."
Mr. Henry is, in fact, showing himself to be a geniil
gentleman interested in the industries of Santa Clara;
one whom the county cannot spare from the walks of
business life. The voters will doubtless keep him in
the sphere where he has proven his ability and re
turn to Congress Mr. Loud, whose ability in state
craft is recognized throughout the Union, and whose
service will be in the future, as it has been in the past,
of immense benefit to his constituents and to Cali
fornia.
Against that sort of campaigning it is hardly worth
while to protest/ There are. "fool" speeches of that
kind in every election, but it is seldom they are ut
tered by a man who is intrusted by- his party with the
duty of making the principal speech at an important
meeting. When so uUered they become of sufficient
importance to merit reply, and it is therefore worth
while to point out that, so far from lacking ability in
Congress, Mr. Loud holds one of the most important
chairmanships of the House, and so far from beinj:
dangerous to his constituents he has done more to
advance their interests than any other representative
they ever had.
To meet the issue raised by the candidacy of so
able a candidate on the Republican side some of the
Democratic leaders have resorted to the desperate
tactics of denying Mr. Loud's ability and questioning
his honor. At a recent Democratic meeting at Palo
Alto, at which was present J. H. Henry, the Demo
cratic candidate for Congress, Frank Karr, president
of the Democratic Clubs of Santa Clara County, the
principal speaker of ihe evening, is reported to have
said: "You know as well as I do that Mr. Loud is
not a man of any ability and is unfit to represent, or
misrepresent, this district in Congress. He is a ser
vile tool and totally unfitted for the placeâ a danger
ous man."
DOWN in the Fifth Congressional District "the
contest is lively, and already there has been
displayed in it some of the \xorst. as well -as
much of the best campaign tactics of the time. ; The
â¢Republican nominee, Mr. Loud, has found among his
constituents the loyal support which in the past has
so often re-elected him to Congress and given him
the opportunity to demonstrate in the House that
high ability which has won for him the esteem of all
his colleagues and enabled him to be of so much ser
vice to his district, his State and the country at large.
His record has attested his merit, and he has there
fore hÂ»d no need to make personal appeals for votes
nor to vaunt his deeds. He has been able to devote
his attention in the campaign to the interests of his
constituents and to the great issues of the nation.
In short, he has stood before the people as a national
statesman, speaking with Tile authority of one who
has an established prestige in Congress.
THE CONTEST IN THE FIFTH-
William T. Baker, ex-president of the Chicago Board of Trade and
of the World's Fair, and one of the leading Democrats of Chicago, has
made an open statement of his purpose to vote for McKinley this fall.
In a letter made public recently he makes a powerful attack agains*
Bryan, who he says personifies 16 to 1 and lawlessness, and is the
greatest "imperialist" since Napoleon Bonaparte.
Mr. Baker has beta well known in the past for his convictions in
favor of free trade and for his aggressive interest in the Â¦work of .the
National Tariff Reform League. Mr. Baker says, however, that even
the Democratic doctrine of free trade has been abandoned for principles
that mean restriction of trade, and, through the Populistic attitude on
"trusts," "a "limitation of all successful enterprise within State lines."
HON. M. A. HANNA, Chairman
Republican National Committee
âMy Dear Sir: The Democratic
organization has passed under
Jhe control of public enemies,
and no man who holds to the traditional
doctrines of the party is under'the slight
est obligation to follow the present lead
ers.
The policies that guided the party from
Jefferson to Cleveland have been side
tracked for the isms of Populists and An
anchlsts. Even free trade has given way
to Bryan's promise that he will "recom
mend such additional legislation as may
be necessary to dissolve every private
monopoly which does business outside of
the State of its origin."
This would mean, under Populist inter
pretation .and control, the limitation of all
successful, enterprise within State Ilne3;
not a captivating programme to suggest
at the moment when American commerce
is being pushed beyond the seas. -
The Democratic crusade against expan
sion termed "imperialism," is an absolute
sham, a silly and hypocritical invention
to divert attention from their revolution
ary purposes. Expansion has been the
policy and practice of the American peo
ple since the pilgrims landed on Plymouth
Rock, and no man who understands the
real spirit of our institutions can be
frightened by the phantom of Imperialism
which Bryan has conjured up for this
campaign only.
Since Napoleon Bonaparte there has
boen no greater imperialist than Bryan
himself. His will is the law of the parly
that supports him, and if elected he would
endeavor to rule the entire nation with
the same iron hand. Napoleon deluge'!
Europe in blood to reach a throne, and
Bryan would not hesitate to wreck every
industry in the land to attain the Presi
dency.
This talk of imperialism is like the rat
tle of the snake that hurts nobody. It is
the head of the reptile that is dangerous

Edwin A. Randlett. vice president of the
Alameda real estate fl.m of E. D. Judd.
& Co.. while In the alleged pursuit of J23O
profit, has placed himself in an unenviable
if not serious predicament. Judge Coffey
has directly charged Kundlett with delib
erate perjury and vloiatlon of his trust
as an officer of the court. He has be?n
given until this morning to adjust his
standing before the court or go to Jail
for his offenses.
A few months, ago Jud-e CofTey or
dered the sale of a piece of real estate
belonging to the estate of the late John
J. Markham. This property Is located
on the northwest corner of Mound and
Van Buren streets in Alameda. The
property was advertised for sale by Sam
uel M. Rogers, attorney for the estate.
No bid being made for the property. U
was placed in the hand? of E. D. Judd
& Co. for pale. Last week Judge Coffey
was called upon to confirm the sale of the
property to Mrs. Mary A. Randlett. wife
of Edwin A. Randlett, for the sum of
$2000. Randlett was called to the stand
and under oath testified that the bid of
fered by his wife was the only one re
ceived by him far the property. Judge
Coffey confirmed the sale of the property.
a deed was made out to Mrs. Randlett
and the deal was closed.
Monday evening Thomas Doolin called
on Judge Coffey and asked how It waa
that the sale of the property wa3 not
confirmed to Mrs. Ellen Dunn, his sis
ter Mrs. Dunn, he said, had bid $2250 for
the" property, which was J2TiO in advance
of Mrs. Randlett's bid. He 'roduced a
contract to verify his statement entered
into between Judd & Co. r.nd Mrs.* Dunn.
Judge Coffey immediately sent for the
attorneys in the case and informed them
of the development. "It Is clear to me
that palpable perjurv has been com
mitted." said Judge Coffey. " and those
who are responsible for this Imposition on
the court will he made to feel the weigh*,
of their errors."
A citation* ordering Randlett to appear
and show cause was iÂ«sued and made re
turnable yesterday morning. Mrs. Dunn
waa also suhpenaed to appear and testify
as to her offer.
Randlett and Mrs. Dunn were both 5n
court when the case w*s called. Randlett
admitted that he hart Mrs. Dunn's con
tract in his pocket when he testified that
the onlv bid received for the pronerty wan
that offered by his wife. "I did not con
sider Mrs. Dunn's offer In the nature of
a bid." fhe Raid, "as -he did not leave a
deposit of 10 per cent of "Hie price of
fered." \
Mrs. Dunn testified that she mnde the
offer as shown by the contract. She be
lieved something was "crookM" In the
matter, however, and r.ow. would not have
anvthing to do with the property. .
"I regret that I have not ft Hank com
mitment in my Docket." said Judge Cof
fey, addressing Randlett. "It is nlaln that
not only the court but Mrs. Dunn has
been imposed unon. Doubtless within a
few days Mrs. Dunn would have come
into possession of the property, and In ad
dition to your commission of $30 vou
would have made a profit of $230. lira.
Dunn will either pay the amount of her
bid Into this court to-morrow morning
or you will be held responsible for the dif
ference between her oid and the amount
paid for the property by Mrs. Randlett.

designs for "painting with the needle."

coverings for the. coronation chamber; In
a similar manner were utilized an Ecce
Homo of the Rembrandt school, several
portrait pictures, and In Spain many adap
tations of the Murillo paintings. Many of
these Spanish, needle workers attained a
crispness of relief comparable to. wood
carving. This relief embroidery reached
such extravagant proportions during the
rel.?ri. of Louis XIV that it far outstripped
the bounds of good taste. .For Instance,
in the King's apartments, were caryatides

HISTORIC STUDIES IN HOA\E FURNISHING.
(Concluded.)
BY MARGARET AINSLEE.
The early Gauls also showed great pro
ficiency in the art of embroidery- This
taste was fostered by Greek merchants,
who brought Oriental goods to the pe
riodical fairs held near the monasteries
and shrines of saints, so that in time the
monasteries became the working .centers
for the early specimens of this crafts
manship. Here the sister art of missal
illumination also flourished, many cf
those clolsteral designs furnishing most
alluring patterns to the embroiderers.
The Monastery of St. Gaul, Switzerland.,
contained workrooms for weavers and
embroiderers, whose handiwork was
greatly encouraged by the church in or
der to increase the wealth of sacerdotal
ornaments. At funerals, too, where the
bodies of the dead lay In state there was
great display of embroidered mortuary
cloths, the pall of Childeric being worked
with 300 golden bees.-
Charlemagne the Great encouraged his
family, court and subjects to perfect
themselves in the art of embroidery, with
which he was very fond of decorating his
huge person. His obliging sistar-ih-law
accordingly founded many convents In
Aquitaine and Provence, where she taught
all the inmates the intricacies of the
various forms of needlework. There i-Â»
still preserved in .St. Peter's, Rome, a
Greek dalmatic called the "imperial dal
matic," because Charlemagne is . sarfd to
have worn It when singing high mass as
a dfeacon upon the day of his coronation.
Entirely aside from Its historic interest
it Is of the greatest artistic value and is
regarded by modern connoisseurs as. the
finest piece of embroidery in the world.
In addition to the numberless small fig
ures of silver and gold embroidered upon
the blue silk foundation are the roundels
on front and back representing the last
judgment and the transfiguration, em
broidered in silk and. gold thread, and
considered marvels of skill.
In Anplo-Saxon England embroidery
made such great strid-s that it was early
known as "Angllcum Opus." Anglo-Nor
man ladles were a'?p rtr.owned for th!3
kina of work, the best-preserved specimen
of their Pklll being the tapestry (wrongly
so called) in the cathedral at Bayeux.

the Conqueror, or by her near relatives:

of England by the Normans. Among the
various well-known early stitches â feather

the "Opus Anglieum," so Justly celebrated
until after the reign of Henry VIII, seems
to have been a modified chain-stitch em
broidery, producing a granulated surface;
Its facial depressions and dimples were
simulated by pressing down upon the
embroidery a heatefl metal rod tipped
with a small bulb.
Returning crupaders adorned with he
jeweled and embroidered trappings and
mantles necessarily exercised a marked
Influence upon the sumptuary arts, modi

cacies of emblazonry. : . u
Cut work or applique work, composed of
ornamental shapes cut out of silk. wool,
velvet or linen, stitched to a foundation
and edged with a gold braid or ornamental
leather girrp now came greatly into vogue.
In the more elaborate yet less artistic
styles the architectural part of the desisrn
was frequently woven, and the sacred fig
ures worked by the embroiderer upon sep
arate material were inserted in the panel
spaces. This method of ornamentation,
combined with graceful. interlacing
scrolls, was especially popular for head
dresses, shoes, eloves and other articles of
apparel. In the Bayeux Cathedral are
"two woolen mittens^ with embroidery on
the hands of two flguies of St. Veronica
surrounded by pearls." Of similar orna
mentation must h:\ve been Laura's dalnty

THE ART OF EMBROIDERY AND LACE MAKING.
The four Police Judges held court yes
terday morning in the Hall of Justice.
They all expressed themselves as pleased
with the new order of things and every
thing went along smoothly. The only ob
jectionable feature was that of taking the
"drunks" from the City Prison to the
courtrooms. Arrangements will be made
so that the Judges can dispose alternate
ly of these cases in the mornings in the
prison.
There was a rivalry as to who would
have the credit of sentencing the first
prisoner. It fell to Judge Conlan. and it
was a unique coincidence that the man
sentenced was the nrst prisoner booked
Monday at the new City Prison. He was
Frank Jennings, who stole a piece of cloth
from a store on Stockton street and was
arrested by Policeman Staples for petty
larceny. He pleaded guilty and the Judge
sentenced him to six months in the .Coun
ty Jail.
Judge Mogan was a close second. ICow
Comora, a Japanese who was convicted
Monday for "stealing a watch from S. II.
Collins, Kearny street, appeared for sen
tence before Mogan yesterday and got
fined ?90, with the alternative of ninety
days In jail. He was immediately taken
before Judge Fritz and got a similar sen
tence for stealing another watch.
WAYNE HARRIS WILL BE
TRIED AT NEW HAIL
After Completing the Jury Judge
1 Cook Orders That His Quar-
ters Be Moved.
Judge Coo^ yesterday rushed through
the work of completing the jury to try
Wayne Harris, the messenger boy, for
murder, and then prepared to move his
quarters to the Hall of Justice. The jury
1s composed of the following named citi
zens:
A. G. Klelnert. 1512 Post street: O. Walhelm.
361S Twenty-eighth street; J. Jacobsen. 13 Sixth
street; G. F. Buswell, IIS Main street; L. C.
Hoffman, 341 Eddy street; G. H. Wiley, 931
Mission street; S. Peters. 3469 Nineteenth

A. J. Schohay. 308 Hayes street; G. Call, 26
Fourth street; H. W. Burmester, 1143 Market
street; J. "W. King, 1043 Valencia street.
After the jury had been sworn, Judge
Cook ordered all members to report at
his new quarters on the third floor of the
Hall of Justice this morning for the fur
ther hearing of the case. A corps of
workmen immediately went to â¢work and
within an hour the court fixtures were on
their way to the new hall. Among them
was an historic chair. A cross, carved on
the arm, serves to identify It. In this
chair Durrant, HofT. Cordelia Botkln and
many others who stand convicted of mur
der, or who have been hanged for, their
crimes, sat when the evidence aÂ«ainst
them was being placed before the jnry.
Judges Lawlor and Dunne will move
their quarters within the next few days.
Japanese Ends His Life With Gas.
Sakuya Yasuda. a Japanese servant
In the family of Alfred Fisher at 2210 Pa
cific avenue, was found asphyxiated in his
bed at 7 o'clock yesterday morning. The
key of the gas burner was fully turned on
and the room was tilled with the fumes.
Yasuda had been drinking to excess on
the previous evening and several empty
liquor bottles were found in his room. The
facts that he had been employed in the
family for a year and a half, that the
house was supplied with both gas and in
candescent lights, and that he was
familiar with the use of both, lead to the
belief that his death was a suicide.
Raid on Tobacco Store.
W. G. Hawkett and Frank D. Worth of
the United States internal revenue service
yesterday seized sixty-five one-pound
plugs of tobacco, 153 one-third-ounce plugs
and six small plugs of twist in the store
of Charles Mattheas & Co.. 1430 Market
street. The tobacco had been taken from
the original stamped boxes and was placed
on exhibition in the window. The removal
of the tobacco from the stamped boxes
prior to its sale to the consumer is con
trary to law. the revenue collectors say,
and they will put an end to the practice,
even though they are forced to raid every
tobacco shop in the city.
Brizzolari's Death Accidental.
The Coroner's inquest into the cause of
the death of A. Brizzolarl rendered a ver
dict yesterday to the effect that death
was caused by a bullet from a rifle in
the hands of William Schoppleln and that
the weapon was accidentally discharged.
Brizzolari was shot through the head last
Sunday while standing on Telegraph Hill
talking to several other boys. Schopplein
was a block away in another croup of
boys. He was examining the rille and It
was accidentally discharged, the bullet
striking Brizzolari in the head.

C. A. Seifert, ex-secretary of the Phar
macy Board, who was mixed up in the
scandal created by the selling of answers
to examination questions, was arrested
yesterday by Detective McMahon on a
warrant from Los Gatos charging him
with obtaining money by false pretenses
from William Johnston, a druggist there.
A felony charge against him for doing
the same thing in this city was dismissed
by Judge Dunne yesterday. ;,"
Injured Brother Was to Blame.
Charles Pollitier, the boy who stabbed
his brother Frank at their home on Min
na street, near Twelfth, on September .2,
appeared before Judge Cabaniss yester
dav The testimony of the witnesses
showed that Frank was to blame for the
attack upon him, and the Judge would
have dismissed the case, but tne boy said
he was willing to go to sea and the case
was continued till Friday that he might
get a ship. __^

ment to advance prices, which was the con
rpicuous feature of yeeterday's stock market,
was not In evidence to-day. The promoters of
the movement desisted from buying stocks on
a large scale, and during the latter part of the
day they refrained altogether from supporting
the market. There was no formidable selling
pressure at any time during the day, and the
decline at the last was on very slight dealings,
but the market proved so soft that at the close
a number of prominent stocks showed net losses
of from 1 to 1H. with the tone decidedly heavy.
Union Pacific Itself, which was made the cen
ter in yesterday's movement foL the advance.
Is c noint lower on the day on a much-lessened
volume of dealings. The stock, nevertheless,
retained a prominent place in the dealing*.
The extreme dullness of the whole market at
the decline seemed to favor the bull party, so
that their change of policy was the more diffi
cult of explanation. The factors upon which
they relied yesterday to help the advance con
tinued In force for the most part to-day. Pos
sibly the unfavorable aspect of the proposed
coal strike settlement, had assumed a rather
more i>ositl\e phase to-day and Lacka wanna
and New Jersey Central scored sharp declines,
though the number of shares transferred was
so small as to deprive the changes of all sig
nificance. The only incident of the day which
resembled aggressive action by the bulls was
the marking up of railroads controlled by the
Vanderbllts or affiliated interests, but without
any discernible influence on the general list.
The rate for call money was held at yester
cay's high rate. The equanimity of trie for
eign money markets, in the face of ihe threat
ening approach of exchange to the gold Import
point, finds no adequate explanation, but for
eign bankers adhere to the view that gold will
not come In spite of to-day's further decline in
discounts both in London and Berlin.
There were some marked advances In prices
of bonds, but the market was not active or
very broad. Total sales, par value, $325,000.
United States bonds were unchanged In the bid
price.

CLOSING.
Bustness was slightly increased in volume In
the markets here to-day and the tone was
good. Influenced by the returns from the elec
tions showing a substantial majority for the
Salisbury Government. Americans were firm,
the public holding aloof pending more definite
news from the Presidential campaign. There
is pome talk about gold exports to New York
and already I hear of some, inquiry from
America for ppecle. The ruling price, how
ever, will not be paid while present rate* of
exchange remain. Silver closed at 29%d, firm
on Indian buying.

CHICAGO. Oct. 2.â The trade in wheat was
small and featureless. November opened at
77?i@'77%c, and advanced 'early to 7"TÂ»c. Liver
pool was higher, Northwest receipts light, the
weather of that section bad, with prospects. of
more of the same kind, and the markets of the
spring wheat territory firm. The crowd was
bullish on this kind of news at the start and
were further strengthened in their views by a
Rosarlo cable announcing wet weather and
poor crop prospects in Northern Argentina. The
market lacked outside support, however, and
November on local sales dropped to 77%@77M.c.
A falling _off in Western receipts caused a
slight rally, November touching 7"Sc. but
Bradstreet's announcement of an increase of
4,318.000 bushels In the world's visible, caused
added discourajerr.ent among holders and the
price slumped to 77c, closing heavy, November,
IWi'iiC lower at 77}gc.
Corn was firm and at times moderately active,
enjoying a somewhat larger outside trade and
a good demand for cash. November closed
%c u;i at 2S%c.
fiats were fairly active. November closed a
shade lower at 22?ie.
Provisions were firm, the first half of the
session on the bullish showing of stocks, but
lo*t part of the advance later on profit-taking,
closing 2% cents higher all around.

ALAMEDA. Oct. 2.-After hearing ar
guments for and against the remanding
of George MacRae, the officer who killed
Myron Brown. Justice of the Peace Mor
ris decided that he would take the case
under advisement until next Tuesday af
ternoon. The Justice wants the testi
mony written up so that he can get a
chance to go over it again. By agree
ment among the attorneys MacRae was
admitted to bail In the sum of $5000, which
ho furnished immediately. ,
In his argument to secure MacRae s
freedom City Attorney E. K. Taylor
quoted liberally from the Bible to show
that before there can be murder there
mrst first be the Intent. In Numbers and
Joshua there were chapters defining mur
der to be the result of a feeling of hatred
of one member of a congregation toward
his brother. Where there was no malice
nnd one man died by the hands of another
he was to be set free and received into
the congregation. Attorney Taylor paid
there was no intent on MacRae s part to
commit murder. He shot a man while in
the performance of his duty. No jury
could hold the officer guilty of murder
or any subordinate charge.
District Attorney Allen argued briefly
against allowing MacRae to go without
punishment of some sort. >v hile he ala
not think the defendant a willful mur
derer, yet he had exceeded his duty for
using his pistol upon men who were guilty
of a mere misdemeanor.
Â¦Indications point that Justice Morris
will dismiss MacRae from custody after
a further consideration of the evidence.

OAKLAND. Oct. 2.â With hair flying in

ALL SYNAGOGUES
WERE THRONGED
Hebrew Day of Atonement
Was Ushered In With
Much Solemnity.
All over the city the discourses of the
rabbis were earnest and advocated higher
spiritual life.
In all the Jewish synagogues last even
ing the services of Yom Klppur, the Day
of Atonement, were begun. At sundown
all the Hebrews began a fast which will
last until the same time this evening. The
services were well attended and were very
impressive. The sound of the harp and
the trumpet were heard. "Vigdal," an
ancient melody, was sung. In all the syn
agogues the services were similar.
At the Temple Emanu-El R<?1Â»- Dr. Voor
sanger delivered a vÂ«ry strorif*address on
the duties of the Hebrew on the Day of
Atonement. He pictured the prophet of
Israel holding up h!s hands that Israel's
hosts might have victory on the field of
battle, and said that th<? contest between
right and wrong, between good and evil,
might be fairly typified by that historical
battle. Ever the fight between good and
evil continues. He d!d net believe In the
orthodox ldt-a that man had begun the
world all good" and had retrograded. Man
has been struggling upward, and will con
tinue to struggle for higher things. He
counseled Hebrews not to observe the Day
of Atonement in any selfish spirit. They
should include the welfare of the entire
world in their wishes. He said that there
was great disparity between the profes
sions and the practices of the nations of
the world, and Instanced the wars that
have been waged, and opce more referred
with emphasis to the action of France in
the Dreyfus case. Men had cherished
their ancient ideals, but had intellectually
advanced only one step at a time, he said
He closed his discourse with the wish that
the rolgn of peace might come, when
every man should acknowledge the Lord.
The music, led by Cantor Stark, who was
assisted by a large choir and instrument
alists, was remarkably fino.
VALIDITY OF POLICE
COURTS QUESTIONED
the City's Heavy Increase
in Population.

LOS ANOELES. Oct. 2.-Tho validity of
the Police Courts of this city has again
been assailed as the result of the an
nouncement by the Census Bureau that

These courts owe their jurisdiction to the
Whitney act. which provides for tribu
nals of their character In cities contain
ing a population of not less than 30,000 nor
more than 100.000. ; .
Soon after the city census authorized
by tho Council in 1897, which Indicated a
population In excess of 100,000. the ques
tion of the validity of the Police Courts
was raised and Judpe Van Wyck ruled
that they had no lesral existence. His
decision was reversed by the Supreme
Court on the ground that the population
of the city was officially as stated by the
Federal census of 1RM and must so re
main until changed by the next Govern
ment census. . ...

THREE OP THE LADIES WHO
ARE TO BLACKEN THEIR
FACES FOR CHARITY.
Mrs. Watt's friends proposed to run her
for president, but it is quite unlikely that
phe will be a candidate. Though she ,has
resigned the resignation was not accepted
and she is still a member of the club, but
has take no part in its affairs since the
recent troubles.
Some of the members who withdrew
from the Oakland Club after the friend?
of Mrs. Watt had taken the reins of gov
ernment have returned to the work of
the club, and the chances are that Mrs.
Watt and her friends will allow the Oak
land Club to continue upon the even tenor
of its way. which has been sadly uneven
of late. Mrs. Watt has all of her belong
ings, and the new club has notified the
Domestic Science department of the old
club, which had its headquarters in the
building at the corner of Peralta and
Fifth streets, owned by Mrs. Watt, to
move. New quarters will be taken up
town and the work continued.
Oakland Club refused to assume the re
sponsibility of the improvements made by
Mrs. Watt in this very work and for the
construction of these very buildings, and
then claimed that her management of the
Domestic Science Monthly was not care
ful and asked her to resign, the storm
broke that culminated in many a with
drawal from the Oakland Club. When
the storm cleared away nothing was
shown but lack of attention to details in
finances, misunderstandings as to where
responsibility began and ended. But many
a tear was shed and many a heartache
had over it all, and not a few bitter words
said.
The club passed votes of confidence in
Mrs. Watt and Mrs. Watt paid all of the
bills that she had incurred in the con
struction of these buildings and then re
signed from the club.
This has settled, to some extent, the ap
proaching election of the Oakland Club.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 2.â In the name of
charity, thirty Alameda society
women stand prepared to sacri
fice their complexions by veneer
ing them with burnt cork, and
to appear In public in a minstrel show.
Their faces equipped with deep- mourn
ing-, these thirty iTark ,secreta will enter
tain their society friends in the most mod
ern style of minstrelsy. The show will
contain the usual quota of endmen, solo
ists and comedians, except that the place
ofthe usual man will be taken by the so
ciety woman. It will be an affair, every
feature of which will be managed by the
ladies.
The Idea of organizing a. society
women's minstrel troupe originated with
Mrs. Charles Gibbs and Miss Harriet
Austin. They were arranging for a house
entertainment for the benefit of the Ala
meda Woman's Charitable Association,
the funds of which are almost depleted.
Quite accidentally Mrs. Gibbs proposed
that the entertainers blacken their faces.
Then Miss Austin proposed something
moreâ a minstrel show. The idea "took
immediately and now the whole town is
Interested. The net proceeds of the per
formance will be turned over to the needy
charitable association. November 1 is the
time set for the minstrel show, that is to
take place in Harmony Hall.
The thirty women who are to do a turn
each in burnt cork behind the footlights
will do all the things that are performed
bv men in a minstrel show. There will be
six endwomen with their tambourines
and bones: the Interlocutor to assist the
pun makers: cakewalkers, who will walk
for a prize; hoedowns and plantation mel
odies. There will bo a "cullud' ladies'
orchestra. A one act farce will contain
only women performers.

ORGANIZES NEW PHILANTHROPIC BODY
W. H. Snow, an aged tailor, residing
at 820V4 Bush street and connected with
the firm of P. Beamish & Co. at 209 Mont
gomery street, was held up and robbed
by four soldiers at the corner of Leaven
worth and Bush streets last evening.
Snow, who is 63 years of age. was re
lieved of his watch and chain by the
thugs and received several ugly cuts on
the head, which seem to have been in
flicted by some sharp instrument. Coin
amounting to- $60 was overlooked by the
thieves. *
According to the story of Snow, who is
now confined to his bed as a result of
his Injuries, the soldiers approached him
at the corner where the hold-up occurred
and demanded carfare to the . Presidio.
This was shortly after 7 o'clock. The old
man put his hand into his pocket intend
ing to comply with the request when he
was attacked by the ruffians. He was
struck on the head several times and
dazed for a few seconds. As the blood
trickled down from the wound the soldiers
proceeded to steal the watch and chain.
Snow wont to his residence as quickly
as possible and told his family of. the
hold-up. His son and daughter immedi
ately pave the information to Officer
James JV Ferrell. The officer took them
to Captain Seymour at the Hall of Jus
tice, where a complete report was made.
Detectives were at once placed on the
case and the department has hopes of
landing the highwaymen.

with a rush in the last sixteenth, and
catching Spencer napping waa first past
the Judges for the coveted prize. The
stake of $20,000 was the feature of the
opening day of the fall meeting of the
Westchester Racing Association. It was
a perfect fall day and an unusually big
crowd was in attendance. The clubhouse
lawn was the gathering place of the so
ciety element and the big grand stand was
comfortably filled. There were ten start
ers for the Matron. Commando, the un
beaten hero of the year, was a hot favor

next in demand at 5 to 1, the others rang

CAPTURES THE
MATRON STAKES
"Twenty to 0," and no Goshen Jim
money In eight, was tbe wail of the
auction pool Bellers at Tanforan Park
yesterday, when betting opened on ttia
2:18 pace. It was fortunate for the friends
of the hoosier named horse that they
were not very "dusty," for the big geld
ing was distanced in the first heat, after
making two disastrous breaks. Irvington
Boy, driven by Cecil, and 6 to 1 in the
books, turned up winner, with Gaff Top
sail second and King Cadenza third. Tha
betting now shifted in favor of King Ca
denza, which pacer was played down to
3 to B favoritism before the second heat.
H. Dunlap, handling the choice, drove as
if out for an airing, and Chloe came home
first, with Gaff Topsail again second.
This caused the bookmakers to lay 2Va
to 1 against the King, which they were
quickly compelled to rub. Reinsman
Dunlap and his horse now became the
reigning sensation, decamping with the
long end of the purse in three straight
heats. After some deliberation, the
Judges fined Mr. Dunlap $100 for laying up
the second heat.
There was but one other event on the
programme, the 2:20 class trot. A strong
wind blew over the course, precluding
any fast time being accomplished.
Only three scored down for the word
in the trot, Richmond Chief with Ed Laf
ferty in the bike making it in three
straight heats. McNally was a good sec
ond on each occasion, but Stella had the
red bunting waved In her face first time
out. After the first heat, trotted In 2:21%.
the judges cautioned Sam Hoy, driver of
McNally, to make -more of an effort to
win. McNally' forced the favorite out in
2:16^ next trip. When the race had been
decided Hoy was fined $25 for laying up
the first heat. Summary:

they have been booked and watch in the

now about the hall. Their terms will soon
expire and they will not be replaced by

If the story told yesterday morning to
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock by Lum Heung be true the authori
ties of Mono County, while technically
and legally right, have been unwittingly
made the agents for the persecution of
Lum Heung or Lem Yung by designing
persons who are attempting to seize his
land. Heung was arrested by the county
authorities on a charge of being a Chi
nese laborer in the country without a cer
tificate of registration, as required by the
act of November 3. 1S93.
He told Judge Heacock yesterday that
he owned an elght-acfe tract of land
eighteen miles from Bridgeport, on which
he had raised vegetables and other prod
uce for the past twentv years. Some
weeks ago some white men told him that
they wanted to build a road through his
land and offered what he considered to be
a ridiculously small price for the land to
be occupied by the road. He refused the
<?ffer and they procured his arrest so that
he might be sent back to China and the
road could be built through his land dur
ing his absence.
Judge Heacock continued the further
hearing of the case for one week, and
Assistant United States Attornev Wood
worth will send to Bridgeport for deposi
tions. Heumr admits that he did not reg
ister and says It was because he had never
heard of the registration act. there being
no Chinamen in his neighborhood.
The Chinese Six Companies have en
gaged Maguire' and Gallagher to defend
Heung. They will raise the point that as
Heung owned his farm and worked only
for himself he was not a laborer and
therefore not required to be registered.
LUM HEUNG MAY LOSE

Alleges That He Is the Victim of a
Conspiracy of White
Superintendent of Schools Webster an
nounced yesterday that ,he was about to
inaugurate a determined â¢ attempt to en
force the compulsory education law, which
requires the attendance in school of every
child between the ages of 5 and 17 years.
The Superintendent has had framed a
resolution which he will, present at . the
next meeting of the Board of Education
and he will strongly urge its adoption. He
will be supported. In his project by at
least two members of the board, and he
believes that the importance of compelling
children to attend school will be realized
by the" full board. Chairman Mark ex
pressed himself in these columns several
months ago as being in favor of taking
some steps to Increase the school attend
ance. Webster's resolution Is as follows:
Resolved and ordered. That Â¦ this Board of
Education appoint certain persona, to be desig
nated as attendance officers,, whose duty shall
be to proceed to the dwellings ami abodes of
the parents of such children as, by the school
census next preceding, were' reported' as having
attended no school during the year; to Inquire
into the causes of such non-attendance; to en
deavor to Induce parents to place their children
at school, and to perform such other functions
as this Hoard of Education may direct, to se
cure children their educational rights. 'â¢'
Webster states further that there will
be submitted at the approaching session of
the Legislature an .amendment to" the
present law on compulsory education,
which Is inoperative because there is no
alternative ' penalty provided. It is in
tended to secure the passage of a bill the
provisions of | which will be more exten
sive and effective in order to secure to
children their educational rights. At pres
ent the penalty for violation is $20 fine for
the first- off ense and not to exceed 130 for
subsequent offenses.
"My idea," sa'd Mr. Webster, "is that
there should be provided schools to which
might be .committed habitual truants or
boys seriously delinquent in deportment.
The measure should provide for attend
ance officers, whose duties are outlined
in my resolution. More effective penalties
should be , inflicted on parents, guardians
or employers. Ample school facilities and
accommodations, which this city at the
present time by no means provides, should
be provided."
"All the public schools of this city are
filled with the exception of two rooms at
the Hancock., two at .he Grant, one at the
Whittler and five at the Jefferson. The
question of how the 18,656 children report
ed as attending no school could be pro
vided with facilities if compelled to attend
arises. The board would be obliged to
rent such rooms and buildings as would
accommodate those seeking school privi
leges., - â¢ Â¦ --
The consolidations recently effected In
the department have contracted school ac
commodations so seriously that in many
instances parents have been unable to
have their .children enrolled- or ; prefer to
send them to private Institutions.
Another important factor to be consid
ered In compulsory attendance is the ne
cessity for a generous appropriation for
free text books. This necessity is ap
parent if the compulsory education law is
enforced. ,

Children of School Age.

the trouble. It was found, however, that many of the pipes have not been connected. A few of the side fixtures corn^

countered as the jets had been provided with no tips. The use of candles was about to be resorteS o again when

The measure was introduced at the be
hest of Mayor Phelan in his itching desire
for patronage. The scheme contemplates
the promotion of Dennis Gordon and Har
ry Zemansky. who are at present em
ployed in the ofllce. Auditor Wells says,
however, that he cannot go beyond the
plain provision of the charter, and he will
refuse to sign their demands if they are
made out at the increased figure.
The board will again run afoul of the
Auditor in the resolution adopted Monday
and also recommended by the Mavor
authorizing th? Civil Service Commission
to appoint throe extra clerks for three
months. The Auditor said yesterday that
the appropriation of $6000 for the commis
sion was being used to the full limit of
the one-twelfth cKarter provision and that
there were no funds with which to pay
any additional clerks. ' Â¦ *
The Supervisors' Finance Committee re
ported yesterday in favor of Mayor Phe
lan'3 recommendation that the Election
Commissioners be authorized to appoint a
deputy registrar and a chief clerk, at a
salary of J150 per month each. Should the
resolution be adopted at the next meeting
of the board it will be- rendered null and
void by the Auditor, who stated yester
day that the board had no power to order
the creation of positions not provided for
by the charter. The salary of the clerks
employed in the Registrar's office is fixed
at $100 per month each. Although Super
visor McCarthy voted to pass to print the
measure allowing the appointment of the
two clerks, he. has looked up the law and
agrees with the Auditor that the board
has net the power to increase the salary
fixed by the charter.

GERALD I. O'BRIEN, the son of
the late J. J. O'Brien, died yes
terday morning at St. Mary's
Hospital of consumption. He
was 24 years old.
The deceased had been in failing health
for the past year and was removed from
his home to the hospital about seven
weeks ago, where he awaited the end with
calmness and fortitude. Before his sick
ness he was considered one of the hand
somest young men in town, and he was a
universal favorite on account of his great
personal magnetism and courtly manners.
When his father died, about four years
ago. he stepped into the very responsible
position of representative of him in the
then large dry goods house of J. J.
O'Brien & Co. For one so young in years
he displayed wonderful business sagacity
and all his friends predicted for him a
very bright future. He was forced to re
sign a business life on account of the
dread disease that took firm hold of him.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
from his late residence, 1417 Geary street,
to St. Mary's Cathedral, where a solemn
high mass will be celebrated for the re
pose of his soul. The deceased was a
graduate of St. Ignatius College, and six
of his former classmates have been se
lected as pallbearers. The interment will
take place at Calvary Cemetery, where
he will be laid to rest by the side of his
deceased father. â¢â¢

Two other matters of interest came up.
Miss Mary Floyd Williams, a graduate of
the library school of the State University
of New York, was elected cataloguer.
Trustee Irving reported that he had an
offer to lease the Mechanics' Pavilion
property for twenty years at the rate of
J1500 per month, the lease including the
right to purchase at the end of ten years
at a price to be fixed now. This last part
of the proposition was not favored by sev
eral trustees, but the understanding was
that Mr. Irving should ascertain with the
other members of his committee what
could be done, as the leasing price was
considered satisfactory.
Trustee Plum offered a resolution em
powering the chairman to reorganize the
committees, and this was adopted after
Mr. Healy had made some additional re
marks to the effect that this was a way
devised to get him out. "But, gentlemen,"
he said, with some vehemence, "you will
not be able to shut me out in that way. I
will make the same objections to the
library list and take the same action from
the floor as I have as a committee mem
ber."
Plum wished to have Mr. Healy called to
ordrr for this, but no action was taJ-;en.
"Xo member of this board," said Mr.
Healy, rising, "has any right to impugn
my motives."
Messrs. Tausslg and Irving, the associ
ates of Mr. Healy on the library commit
tee, arose in turn and offered their resig
nations as committee members If they
were to serve with Mr. Healy. Trustee
Cosgrave also said the Issue had been
fairly raised whether the trustees would
stand by Mr. Healy or with the majority
of the library committee. Mr. Cosgrave
added fuel to the flame by saying that
Mr. Healy was not honest in making ob
jections and in offering obstruction.
Trustee Kendrlck was In the chair and
he proceeded to put the motion to vote
after It had been duly seconded. On a call
for the ayes and noes Trustees Healy,
Kendrick, Xeal, Plumb and Wallis de
clined to vote. There were five votes in
favor of the motion and five againstâ a
tie.
Trustee Healy sat still until Trustee
Cosgrave had done speaking, and then
asked permission to speak, which was
granted. He then warned the members of
the board against giving Ijim any unpleas
ant notoriety. It would be better, he said,
to dismiss him at oncel He also said that
he pointed to Ms record as chairman of
the library committee for two years be
fore the advent of the present librarian
with satisfaction. Then there had not
been any contentions and everything had
passed off amicably. He hinted that if he
should be removed the act would prove a
boomerang.
The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
hart a spicy session last evening. For
some time there has been friction In the
library committee, which consists of
Trustees Irving, Healy and Mead. When
the new business was reached Trustee
Cosgrave arose and moved that the board
should remove Mr. Healy from the library
committee and put some one in his place.
Mr. Cosgrave alleged that Mr. Healy was
an obstructionist and prevented the trans
action of business by captious objections
and by long discussions.
