by a 'firm- which, has been liT
opposition to union' labor and which has
devoted great sums of money to an effort
to destroy all organizations of labor.
' Yet Bryan has made. most of his money
through the employment of cheap labor.
He has become rich because bindery girls
were forced to labor upon his books for
the miserable pittance of $1 50 a week;
because printers, pressmen and book
binders were forced to toil ' for J6 to J10
a week, in the preparation of . Bryan's
pronjises of what he would do for labor if
he 'had thÂ© power. Organized labor has
determined to expose these facts, which
smell of the crudest deceit and double
dealing. ,
When . William Jennings . Bryan .went
home four years ago a defeated candi

be his and he determined to. write a book
for profit. With that foresight whicb
characterizes his financial contracts he
insisted.- upon receiving the lion's share
of the proceeds. Late In 1S96 It was an
nounced that he would write a copyright

The price was first fixed at $1 a copy, but
later it was raised to $1 50 a copy. It
was expected that millions of copies

In defiance of protest Bryan has con

ROCHESTER. N. T.. Oct. 30.â When the
Roosevelt train arrived here to-day the
party found great crowds at the sta
tion and both halls and a splendM greet
ing was accorded to the Vice Presidential
candidate. There was an immense pa
rade of clubs and business men's associa
tions and both auditoriums where Gov
ernor Roosevelt spoke were filled to over-
Sowing. There was an enthusiastic gath
ering at Corning, the home of the club
that was assaulted at Elmira last night.
The only unpleasant incident of the day
ot-curred at Geneva, where 2000 persons
assembled at an open-air meeting to hear
Go\-ernor Roosevelt at 5 o # 'clock this even
ing. The Governor, however, spoke under
difficulties, for soon after he began he was
interrupted by cheers for Bryan, followed
by hisses, cat-calls and all sorts of de
risive jeers. He did not pay any attention
to it at first, but as the disturbance *rew
greater he turned about and faced the
"disturbers and appealed to them to at
least preserve order If they did not hap
lÂ»en to agxre with what he said.
"So Democratic speaker," he said, "has
ever been greeted in this manner by Re
publicans, and you and your party are the
only sufferers by such conduct."
The only thing that was intelligible from
the stand waÂ« 'â¢Hurrah for Bryan!"
"Why?" said the Governor. "Because
ho is for Dick Croker? Because he is
tfraid to say what he would do. about
free silver? Does the gentleman say 'Hur
rah for Bryan' because he wants to haul
dovn thi flag? Is that the reason he says
'Hurrah for Bryan T
"Now. gentlemen," continued the Gov
ernor, raising his voice so as to be heard
rbove the turbulent cries which still con
tinued, "I want to say one thing to you
here. There is one thing more important
than any difference of policy among
A merlcans, and that Is the keeping of our
own self-respect. Whenever you see a
party that tries to interrupt a public
Fr^aker you may be sure it Is because
they dare not hear the truth. Mr. Bryan
enmes to this State, and I am proud, to
j-^c h*^ is listened to with respectful at
tontion wherever he goes, no matter how
much he may differ with; you In opinion.
The -worst reflection that can be cast upon
the followers of Mr. Bryan Is cast upon
them by their own action when they try
to break up an orderly meeting and try to
interrupt free speech, and when they do
it they hurt no one but themselves. Gen
tlemen," continued the speaker, "I appeal
to you for the honor of the flag."
But he was interrupted by renewed
ehouts of "Hurrah for Bryan!"
"Gentlemen," said the Governor. "I
want you to reflect what a poor showing
you make when you try to interrupt an
appeal to the flag."
This remark caused the noise to dimin
ish somewhat, but it soon renewed and
continued until the Governor finished his
rrmarke.
"Do you hurrah for Bryan because he
Â¦would haul down the flag?" asked the
Governor. More hisses and cat-calling
followed until there was utter confusion.
Attempts to restore order only called
forth more yelling. The Governor con
tinued his talking between times until it
vas time for his train to pull out. When
he t=tartÂ«*d for it a crowd surged around
him. yelling for Bryan, jeering and.en
<Jcavorir.g to prevent him from boarding
h'.s train. It took the efforts of all the
police present to effect a passageway so
that the Governor could get to his train.
At Oanandalgua. where a good-sized
crowd had gathered despite the fact that
It was raining and the train was a half
hour late, the Governor addressed his
audience on the subject of prosperity and
on the trust question. He said:
"Prosperity, like this rain, falls upon
the Just and the unjust. It is falling upon
the just at this moment, .but still it Is
falling upon the unjust, as Mr. Bryan is
making a tour of the State."
It was after 9 o'clock when the Gover
nor's train rolled into Rochester. The
Governor proceeded at once to the halls
where the speaking was to take p*lace.
He discussed in the general way that he
has at other points the trusts and im
perialism and made a new issue here, an
swering In a certain way Mr. Croker*s
allusion to the lack of opportunity for
young men in this country. He said in
part:
â¢There has been much talk, and I fear
by no means sincere talk, on the part of
our antagonists recently to the effect that
the young man has now little chance in
â¢work. Well, gentlemen, most of us here
In this meeting who are of middle-age
have sons, and when this is the case it
may be set down as certain that we are
deeply concerned as to the future wel
fare of those sons. I ask every father
her* to answer to himself the question
whether he would prefer his boy to start
In life with the prospect of Bryanism
ahead of him or with the prospect of the
continuance of the present policies.
Merely to put the question in this way
le enough to show the absurdity of the
claim made by our opponents.
"Bryanlsm means widespread and far
reaching business calamity and disaster,
and therefore it necessarily means grind
ing poverty for the many, and even* for
the few more fortunate anxiety and.busi
ness disaster.
"It is a mere axiom that a young. man's
rhancee are best in a community where
there is general prosperity. It is equally
an axiom that in a time of great business
depression a young man's business
chances are at a minimum. As a matter,
of fact, there is no other country in -the
world to-day which begins to offer the
chmscea to yovr.c men that America of-
fers. The very combinations of corpo
rate wealth of which such bitter and in
some cases just complaint is made have
at their heads men who, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, started as young
men with little but their own energy and
brains to help them.
"Undoubtedly the extraordinary devel
opments of corporate wealth and ' great
concentrations, not alone in capital, but
in population, of the last generation, have
produced serious problemsâ problems
which will tax the skill of the wisest
legislator, but all of which we are in
honor bound to try to solve. I believe
that much can be done, both to better the
condition of the wage-worker and to les
sen some of the undoubted abuses of cor
porate wealth. I will stand shoulder to
shoulder with any man who in good faith
works along reasonable lines toward these
ends, but I will take part in no crude and
vicious efforts to reform all inequalities
of prosperity by destroying all prosper
ity. This is precisely what Mr. Bryan and
his associates propose to do.
"There are many ways in which our
civic and social conditions can be bet
tered, but such betterment can be brought
about only by honest, kindly, resolute
facing of facts and seeking remedies, not
by indiscriminate denunciation and pan
dering to evil associations for political
gain."
CLEVELAND'S VIEWS.
Former President Did Not Say There
Would. Be a Landslide for Bryan.
PRINCETON, N. J T . Oct. 30.â Grover
Cleveland was Indignant when he learned
that he had been quoted as having pre
dicted a landslide for Bryan. The discred
ited statements were printed In large type
on the first page of the Philadelphia
Times. A special correspondent. of that
paper, signing the initials "B. J.B.," de
clared that the former President had ex
pressed the belief that r McKlnley would
not .be re-elected. The reasons assigned,
among others, were that union labor Is on
Bryan's side, the traveling 'talesmen are
now with him and many Hollanders .'In
the West and Northwest- are opposed 'to
McKlnley on account of his attitude dur
ing the Boer war. Â¦ ,.
"When Mr. Cleveland's attention ' was
called to these allegations this afternoon
he said: "It is an unmitigated falsehood-*
a lie from, beginning to end. Make ijy
denial unqualified and as emphatic as pos
sible. It cannot be too strong. ' Why,'. 1
would not be fool enough' to say such
things; they do not represent my. senti
ments." Â¦ â¢; 'â¢Â¦_ Â¦ v:~'- -; â¢Â¦;Â¦
The Interviewer mentioned his brief
note to his former Postmaster.'General.
Don M. Dickinson.
"Yes, my record is there," remarked Mr.
Cleveland. "Dickinson communicated with
me, and in reply I said substantially that
my sentiments had not changed since I
made that speech. Some one had the en
terprise to look up the speech.- While I
do not say that what is now published is
exactly what I said, I may say that if the
speech is correctly quoted it contains my
views as they then Â¦were and as they now
are. It is a part of my record, and I have
no desire to change it."
Mr. Cleveland was informed that it was
reported in Princeton that the alleged in
terview had been written or inspired by
an elderly man who had spent a few days
at the Nassau Hotel, Mia who had actu
ally called upon him and seen him. '
"Do you recall the person who told you
that he was from Nebraska?" was asked.
"Well," said the former President,
"there was a decrepit old creature at my
house the other day. He represented that
he was from Nebraska and a great friend
of J. Sterling Mbrton. On Mr. Morton's
account I received him, and we chatted
possibly ten minutesâ no more. He was
very deaf. I spoke to him about Mr. Mor
ton's attitude in the present campaign and
he did not seem to know anything about
It. .So I concluded that there must be
something wrong and he could scarcely
be as intimate with Mr. Morton as he
wished to appear, and I cut the conver
sation short." Â¦
AROUSING CLASS HATRED.
Bryan and His Managers Realize
Their Issues Have Failed.
CHICAGO. Oct. 30.â Chairman Hanna
said to-night it was evident to him that
the Bryan managers had abandoned every
issue to arouse class hatred and create
suspicion as to the honesty of the elec
tion. V'/Â£'
"It is not mere coincidence that Bryan,
Croker, Jones and Carter Harrison should
all break loose at the same time' to taik
about election frauds," he said. "Croker
is quoted in the morning papers as ad
vising the Democrats in every election
precinct to remain at the polling place
after the election,, count noses and then,
if the Judges of election did not make the
returns that agreed -vlth the count, to
go into the polling place and throw the
judges into the street.
"At the same time Jones and Harrison
gave out bombastic statements here in
Chicago about preparation to compel the
Republicans to give a fair count of the
returns. I say these things" did not hap
pen as a mere coincidence. They bear
all the evidence of a plain understanding
between Croker and the Democratic '.lead*
eers in Chicago. These things are the de
velopment of Bryan's campaign of hate,
which he began at Salem. 111., three weeks
ago, when he charged that the Republi
cans were determined to secure the elec
tion of their candidate .by. -corrupting
voters and by coercion and fraud.

EXPLOSION OF GAS
OCCTTES JUT JUNE
NEW TORK, Oct. 30.-AU the efforts of
the authorities are now directed to clean
ing away the ruins of the Tarrant and
other buildings wrecked by the great ex
plosion of yesterday In the desire to find
how many bodies are buried in them and
to ascertain the cause of the explosion.
The efforts of the searchers for the dead
were rewarded to-day* by the finding of
the remains of H. C. A. Sci.mldt of Brook
lyn, and the discovery of what seem to
be the bodies of three other people.
Schmidt was an engraver and had an of
fice on the first floor of 101 Warren street.
The body could be seen pinned down un
der a mass of twisted, iron, but could not
be got out to-night. .The identification was
made by a nephew of Schmidt.
At the northwest corner of the Tarrant
building, at Warren and Greenwich
streets, a mass of clothing and indiscrim
inate articles was discovered, and the
mass was said to be the bodies of three
people. . The firemen' went to work with
a will, and to-night brought to light a
portion of a woman's foot and the top of
a erushed-In skull. The skull had long
brown hair attached and is supposedly
that of a woman.
During the day Superintendent Dooner
had .a very large force of men working as
hard as possible tearing down piles of de
bris and removing it. The flre burned all
day, and toward night was practically to
the end of the mass of debris at Wash
ington and Warren streets. The flre ex
tends back some distance and is burning
fiercely.
One hundred and eighty patrolmen un
der Captain Westervelt and InsrSctor
Brooks were stationed at the ruins at 6
o'clock, relieving the day force. Both In
spector Brooks and Captain Westervelt
were skeptical over the reported largo loss
of life. . They both said they did not ex
pect more than four or five bodies would
be found in the ruins.
Playing, on the still burning ruins were
four engines, and they kept their streams
going continuously.
A revised list made to 12 o'clock to-night
shows thirty persons still mTssing. .
At- 10:30 o'clock a portion of a human
trunk, probably, the abdomen, was dug
out, and a little later a' brown canvas
coat. There was nothing in the pockets
but four quill toothpicks. Still later the
firemen .found another portion of a skull
and a portion of a human back. Just be
fore midnight a workman found a black
cheviot coat in the exact spot where the
human remains were found. In the pock
ets were 4 cents and an application for
membership in the West End Republican
Club. Shortly afterward in the same place
an unrecognizable mass of human flesh
was found. A half-foot was also found in
this place.
Dr. Cromer of the Health Department,
who examined the remains, said they were
probably all from the same person, as
were the foot and a portion of a skull
found earlier. The remains were all found
in the Tarrant building.

Victor Hugo Mathusek, the piano man

Charles Francis Buckley, son of the pro
prietor of the Home Made Hotel, said to
day Â¦ that when the explosion occurred
twelve men and women, known , as the
"nfght shift," were asleep on the top floor
of the hbteK .There were also many men
and women who -live out of the city who
were registered at the hotel. No one in
New Tork knows whether these patron*
escaped -or not, because few if any of
them have relatives or friends here.
Of â¢ the employes who were asleep th*
women were Irish and German girls who
have recently come to this country. They
have no friends, no home outside of the
hotel and there Is no one to Inquire for
them if they are missing.
Far Into the night while the work of
digging continued hundreds of 'men, wo
men arid children 'with anxious faces
pushed against the police* lines and begged
admittance. The bureau of Information
established at the Leonard street station
was nothing to these anxious folk. The
promise made them by the sergeant to let
them' know when there was news, either
good or' bad, did not satisfy their grief.
All through' the day and into /the wet
night these anxious* men, women and chil
.dren stood, growing more anxious as time
passed. " â¢ " . ; I . Â¦
:''jTt.was the conviction to-day of not only
FlrV Chief Croker and Chief Murphy, but
also ,-of * Thomas '.T.' Main, Â¦ president. . and
W. C. Allen, treasurer of Tarrant & Co..
that the tremendous explosion was caused
by gases generated from chemicals by
the heat of the flre. There was one Im
portant point of difference, however. The
officers of Tarrant & Co. declared they
did not have stock In sufficient quantities
of chemicals of any explosive character
to cause the great damage. Their con
tention la that the fire cauaed all of their
varied stock of drugs to vaporize and that
the resultant gas did the stupendous work
of destruction. The flre department offi
cials do not believe that " the ordinary
stocks of drugs and chemicals of a whole
sale druggist could under any condition
develop an explosive force- capable of
hurling: a steel and stone seven-story
building Into the air and crumbling: up
five other big buildings. The theory Is
gaining ground that the explosion was
caused by the action of waters and other
chemicals on a great quantity of chlorate
of potash stored in the building.

NEW YORK, Oct. 80.â Eugene V. Debs,
candidate for President on the Social
Democratic ticket, spoke at Cooper Union
to-night to an audience that filled the
peats and crowded the aisles. The rush
at the doors in getting in was so violent
that women were more or less roughly
handled. The audience comprised almost
as many women as men. Mr. â¢ Debs was
accompanied by his wife and two: other
ladles and was welcomed with tumultuous
applause. . .
The speaker referred to the recent ccal
strike in the anthracite region of Pennsyl
vania, where the mine owners, he charged,
fix the rate of wages. Continuing, he
said: .
"Let me ask both parties what they will
do to rescue the wage-earners from serf
dom? No matter, whether the Democrats
or the Republicans win, there will be no
change In the condition of the "laborer.
In a few years longer the* middle class,
what's left of it, will; be in the working
class. The era- of small production 1 haÂ»
gone. If you have a few thousand dol
lars left the best you can do is to invest
It in Socialist propaganda.'-' ' /
In the concluding part of : his '< speech
Mr. Debs said: â¢ â¢
"I would scorn to hold public office. We
want only the votes of those who; are in
telligent enough to know what they arÂ«
voting for.' Free yourselves before you
free the Filipinos. " You are the property
of your masters.- Capital owns the tools"
and the tools own you. ; If the flag Is the
symbol of elavery I defy it and if this be
treason let them make the most of It"

This is ; the ? story ; of William Jenning3
Bryan's friendship for American labor.^It
is : the'' friendship . which ' feeds his purse
and exposes the treachery of his tongue. Â¦
It employed the cheapest of <: labor ''and'
to it Bryan turned in his choice for a pub

If it wanted any printing, but the

company had been union it had acted un
fairly and the campaign being over it de
termined to return to its former, policy of

when he chose this; company as: his pub
lisher. - â¢ Â¦ . , ; ' - . Â¦Â¦ Â¦-Â¦Â¦% '.,!â¢-
But he made great profits by his deal.
While he was doing this the International
Typographical Union was not Idle. An
appeal -was made to , its executive ' officers
against the outrage which â¢ had been per
petrated upon union labor. : The executive
committee was quick to act. and the juris

A" year, ago the Conkey Company, noto

wanted none of them. It was a matter

against honest wages.:
DUNKIRK, N\X, Oct. 30:-\Villiam J.
Bryan concluded "the. final day of his last
New York, campaign todr In this city'to
night.," He began the day at the'town' of
Addison, and spoke at the following other"
places. "â¢ HornellsviHe, Almond, Alfred,
Andover, Wellsville. Belniont, Friendship,
Cuba,- Hinsdale, Oleon, Salamanca, -Ran
dolph, Jamestown and Dunkirk. ' All these
towns are in the. southwestern part of the
.State, and all have been etr6ngly.Repub
lican. : The meetings of the* day were gen
erally well attended and some of ihe'm
quite enthusiastic. Mr. Bryan left late
to-night on the Lake Shore road for Ohio,
expecting to begin a one-day tour of that
State with a Bpeech at Toledo to-morrow
morning at 11 O'clock. AH told he' fim
made about 110 speeches in '.this State.
Before leaving here to-night Mr. Bryan
made a brief .statement, giving his im
pressions of the .'situation in. New- York.
He said: '.
"If the reports which come from the
various counties Where polls have been
made can be taken as representing the
general sentiment throughout the State,
we have more than an even chance of
carrying the State."
Mr. Bryan's audience at Cuba was com
posed largely of men, and notwitstandlngr
that rain fell during the entire time he
was speaking he held on to the end. There
was .close, attention and frequent though
not general applause. He again discussed
the trusts and the army question, but took
occasion to explain why .the subject of
finance was not receiving more attention
at his hands. On that point he said:
"In order that no Republican may go
away and say that I did not say anything
on the money question. I want to tell
you that there are two â¢ reasons why. we
do not spend our time talking about the
questions of 1896. The first reason is that
our platform sets forth the party's posi
tion so that everybody can go to the plat
form and find out. Just where our party
stands, but you cannot say : that of the
Republican platform. The second 1b that
press says to-day:.. The appointment of
Charles M. Hays to be president of x the
Southern Pacific Company will mark the
beginning of many important changes in
the Western railroad system as well as
in the management of the Southern Pa
cific itself. In the first place Mr. Hum
ington's aggressive and Independent policy
with reference to competitors will give
way to a more friendly spirit, and it can
be said that early steps will be taken to
renew the old traffic alliance on a basis
closely resembling a pool..
! Mr. Hays, while with the Grand Trunk
Railway, pursued a policy that was cal
culated to " make friends with Western
roads and his intimate- knowledge of the
Grand Trunk's rival, the Canadian Pa
cific, will enable him to protect the South
ern Pacific's through traffic to the Pacific
Coast without Irritating all " the other
transcontinental lines, as Mr. Huntlngton
sometimes did. - Â¦
So far as . the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company is concerned it is now consid
ered likely that it may be controlled In
the joint Interest of. several: of. the big.
Western "railroads and that It will . nj
longer be used as a whip-handle by the
Southern Pacific. Such a joint control
would make for the improvement of the
business of all the railroads and all woutd
be great gainers. Â¦,_..-Â¦ .
It is raid that Mr. Hays has been given
to understand that closer alliances be
tween the Western roads are'&ontemplat
ed, and he will manage, the Southern Pa :
cine along these lines.
In regard to the Southern Pacific itself
Mr. Hays will pursue much the Â»am3
policy that he has on the Grand Trunk
and Wabash. His constant aim has been
to cut down operating expenses without.
Injuring the road.
A more friendly policy toward the Atch
ison will be pursued, and It la.. expected
that there, will be some understanding be
tween the two companies as to new con
struction wherever their territory over
laps, just as In the case of the New York
Central and Pennsylvania roads. -

Mr. Bryan was introduced to the largo
audience which assembled at' the railroad
station to welcome," him to Wellsvllle' by
Manton Marble Wyvell. Mr. Wyvell is
a resident of Wellsville, but a student of
Cornell University. Mr. Bryan met him;
upon the occasion of his visit to Ithaca
on his tfrst tour of the. State and took
puch a fancy to the young man that-he in
vited him to make â¢ this tour with him.
In refipondUigr to the introduction, which
was gracefully delivered, Mr. Bryan said
that he was pleased to be presented by
the young man and then he came nearer
delivering a lecture on the aspirations and
possibilities - of young manhood than to
making a political speech. He said that
he wanted this Government to be so good
that .any man in it could aspire to the
highest position in either politics or busi
ness and that he was not willing that It
should be a government for corporation
lawyers and trust magnates only.
While Mr. Bryan was speaking at Wells
ville two boys, one of them much larger
than. the other, got into a quarrel and the
large one struck the. smaller one. with his
fist. When Mr. Bryan had stopped speak
ing and the rush to shake hands had be
gun, Mr. Bryan walked across the â¢ plat
form of the. car and called for the boy
who had received the blow, saying that he
wanted to shake- hands with a youngster
who had become a victim of the policy ot
force. The boy. seemed to forget his afflic
tion in the handshaking and when- Mr.
Bryan handed him a rose from. a bunch
held In Mrs. Bryan's hands his cup of Joy
seemed quite, complete. "
.-'Mr. Bryan arrived at 'Jamestown at 4:30
and a stop of about two hours was made.
Mr. Bryan made only a brief speech; but
his principal address was made at Cele
ron, three miles up Lake Chautauqua. He
was escorted to that resort by a local com
mittee. The mode of conveyance was a
trolley car. . While the trolley, trip was in

Mr. Bryan w'as enthusiastically received
-whpn he entered the hall, and the s.peech
was frequently applauded as it progressed.
He" began with U discussion of the ques
tion of prosperity, denying' that there la
a general prosperity, as has been claimed.'
â¢ On thut subject : hÂ« said In part:.
"Go to your sweatshops if you will and
talk of prosperity to those who work
there. Do it if you 1 will, and talk pros

his boys and girls away from home when
they ought to be In school! Talk to him

to-day are such that, the men who pro
duce wealth are getting each year a Ie3s
percentage of the wealth they produce
while the speculator is getting a "larger
and larger share of the country's wealth."
Giving his remedy for trusts, Mr. Bryan
said he. would take the tariff off of every
trust-made Â¦ article as one means of pre
venting the formation of trust combina
tions. "But here," he said, "you have
been in favor of protection. Tour votes
show that your country has been largely
devoted to a protective tariff. But - how
can any man defend a protective tariff
when a trust hides behind It and plunders
the American citizen and' then treats for
eign nations more kindly than the home
country?" .
In closing Mr. Bryan said: "I believe
from what I have seen in this State that
the Democracy of this State are united
for victory. You have up here in this sec
tion your distinguished ex-Senator, "and it
is not necessary for me to make a speech
in the . parts of the State where Mr. Hill

tions whose missionaries were killed ana
injured and missions destroyed are now .1:
PeKing conferring witn Mr. i Conger and
Mr- uocKinil. Private citizens whose
property was destroyed have submitted
claims to the State Department, but they j
have invariably been notified that sucn 1
action is premature, the time not yet hav
ing arrived! when consideration can be
-given to the question of indemnity.
The State Department has been . in
formed that other powers have been col
lecting data upon which to base claims
for Indemnity. It is known here that
Germany has sent out a circular detailing (
specjtlcally the injuries for which com- |
pensation can be demanded and request
ing immediate information in order that
trie Berlin Government may formulate its 1
demand. In view of these facts it is evi
dent that there is no foundation for the |
report that Si0O.00O.p0O is being collected by
tne powers aa the amount of indemnity.
It is expected that the total. will be far in
excess of that sum. The only way in
demnity can be paid, in the opinion of
well informed officials here, is for the Im
perial Government to seize the estates or
persons responsible for the outrages and
to compel the rich men of China to pay
a certain proportion of the remainder of
the sum required.
The maritime customs are pledged for
Russian loans and to British and German
bondholders and the Internal .taxes are
also required in part to pay China s for
eign debt. â . .
Count Cassini. the Russian Embassador,
called at the State- Department to-day

of the Government to make General Wil

. FOR THE CHILDREN.
â¢To â¢ Keep Their Digestion Perfect
' .Nothing Is So Safe and Pleasant
.â¢ " ; as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
'Thousands" of men and women have
found Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the saf-
est and most reliable preparation for any
form of Indigestion* or stomachy trouble.
Thousands of people who are not sick,
but are well and wish to keep well, take
Stuart's Tablets after every meal to. In-
sure perfect digestion and avoid trouble.
But It Is not generally known that the
Tablets are just as good and wholesome
for little folks as for their elders.
Little children who are pale, thin and
have no appetite, or do not grow or
thrive, should use the tablets after eat-
ing â¢ and will derive great benefit from
them.
Mrs. G. H. Crotsley, 63S Washington
street, Hoboken, New Jersey, writes:
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Just fill the
bill for children as well as for older
folks. I'Ve had the best of luck with
them. My three-year-old girl takes them
as readily as candy. I have only to say
"tablets" and she drops everything else
and runs for them.
A Buffalo mother a short time aero, -who
despaired of the life of her babe, was so
delighted with the results from giving
the child these tablets that she went be-
fore the notary public of Erie County, N.
Y., and made the following affidavit:
Gentlemen: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
were recommended to me for my two
months' old baby, which was sick and
puny and the doctors said was suffer-
ing from indigestion. I took the child to
the hospital, but there found no relief. A
friend mentioned the Stuart Tablets and
I procured a box from my druggist ana
used only the large sweet lozenges In
the box and was delighted to find they
Were Just the thing for my baby. I feel
Justified in saying that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets saved my child's life.

For no matter hÂ«w young" or

ders In increasing flesh, . appetite and

for McKinley and Roosevelt. Mr. = Dillon

advisable. He therefore will cast his vote
for the Republican standard bearers.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN Jose, Oct. 30.â The suit of Miss
Fannie Stockton, who has brought an ac
tion against the City Board of Education
for reinstatement as a teacher in the
department, is attracting a great deal of
attention among the local educators. In
June Miss Stockton and nine other teach
ers were dropped. The charter provides
that teachers shall be dismissed only for
cause,* and Miss Stockton a.t onoe Â¦ began
suit for reinstatement, claiming politics
had supplied the animus for her removal.
The case will come up for hearing on
November 12. To-day Miss Stockton by
her attorney served notice upon County
Treasurer Lotz not to pay the salaries
from this time on of Robert A. Lee, Jen
nie Cllker, Isabella Da'ley, Mary Mont
gomery, Alice Kenny, Nettle Feeley and
Mrs. John Barry. These teachers were
elected to take the places of those re
tired. Treasurer L/Otz says he will run
no risk and will withhold the salaries un
til the case is finally settled in court.
With Miss Stockton In this move are
Miss Lois Peckham. Miss Lillian Church
and Miss Frances Sawyer. If these teach
ers win their suit 'a half-dozen others will
carry their cases into court.

SAXTA BARBARA. Oct. 30.â William
Graves of San Luis Obispo. Democratic
candidate for Congress, met a rather cool
reception here this evening. Other attrac
tions occupied all the available halls in
town. A platform was erected in front of
the City Hall and Mr. Graves and Judge
Lamme of Los Angeles held an outdoor
meeting under the auspices of the local
Bryan club. The Democratic orator, \V.
H. Alford, did not appear as advertised.
Graves' speech was short. He ridiculed
the full dinner pail argument, saying it
appeaied only to the â¢ appetite. Senator
Hanna was characterized as the King Pin
of the trusts. The anthracite coal strike
was cited as an instance of the evil of
trusts. Imperialism was â¢ deplored and
Aguinaldo's followers likened to our fore
fathers of the colonies. In closing, Mr.
Qraves said:
"1 would rather see the flag snatched
from the masthead a thousand times than
unfurled for imperialism, the death knell
of the republic."
Judge Lamme said in part: "If you do
not elect Bryan this time you never will.
I veritably believe that four years more
of McKinleyism will so fasten imperial
ism upon the country that it cannot be
shaken off. The standing army will ex
ceed a quarter of a million men."
GRAVES MEETS A FROST.
Notwithstanding the threatening aspect
of the weather the meeting was one pf
the largest held in Marys\-ille during the
present campaign. Lawrence Schilllg, Re
publican nominee for the Assembly, acted
as chairman, and the McKinley and
R.oosevelt Glee Club rendered a number
of campaign songs.

SEATTLE, Oct. JOlâ The Bteamahlp
Ohio, which arrived yesterday from
Nome, brings news of tha wreck ot the
schooner Frances Alice, owned in this
city, on the Siberian coast. The schooner
was of 130 toas register and carried a
crew of seven, all of whom were saved.
The vessel was blown ashore during a
fierce gale. Her anchors were down and
she was fifteen hours drifting on the
rocks. The sea was so rough during the
time that it was Impossible to escape in
the small boats and the men stayed with
their vessel to the end. In making their
way to the shore Miner Bruce of this city,
owner of the schooner, was badly injured.
An arm was broken and he was badly
bruised. . * . ...Â»
The steamer Aloha finally arrived on the
scene and Â¦> rescued the party. The men
had been preparing for a winter of star
vation, an experience similar to that suf
fered by the crew of the Eacreet. which
went ashore on St. Lawrence Island.
The anouncement is as follows:
"The arrangement by which Sloan was
to be first jockey to the Prince of Wales
next season will" not be carried out."
The Sportsman "communicated this in
formation to the various morning paper",
and the latter express approval of the de
cision of the Prince of Wales, which Is
undoubtedly due to the agitation started
by Lord Durham. -
A few weeks ago a sensation was sprung
in the racing world by an attack made by
Lord Durham upon the American jockeys
riding in England. Lord Durham, accor
ing to the first reports that were cabled
across the water, charged the American
boys lth unfair methods and made a
vigorous assault upon their style of riding.
He deprecated their presence on the Eng
lish turf and asserted that much damage
was being done to the sport through their
tactics. Â¦"-': .
Of course such harsh criticism brought
forth a storm of disapproval from promi
nent American horse owners not only in
England but throughout America as well.
It was pointed out that Lord Durham's
allegations were not based entirely, on
fact and that he no doubt was piqued
owing to the remarkable success scored
by ths American boys. Â¦ â¢
Subsequently Lord Durham wrote a long
letter to the London Times in explanation
of his former criticism, in which he said:
"I have never condemned the. 'style' of
American riding or American training. On
the contrary, I share in the respect .which
all Newmarket trainers feel for the-char
acter and abilities of Messrs. Huggins and
Pincus. Two years ago. in a public
speech. I welcomed the advent of Sloan
as productive of good rather than evil.
"But I do disapprove the methods of the

jockeys. I prefer an Increase of Engrlist
boys to augmentation of the existing num
ber of Americans if the methods of th<
latter are to be similar to t&e methods oi
those I have named."
Naturally such a letter did not tend tc
mollify the American Jockeys nor .theii
supporters either -lm England or in this
country. . Moreover," as Sloan, tha tw(
Relit boys and Maher continued to wir
with the majority of their mounts to thÂ«
discomfiture of the English boys there 1Â«
some reason for the assertion, that noi
only the English riders, trainers and own
ers but the English turfites in genera
have become Jealous of the Americar
jockeys. It is very probable that, yield
ing tothis sentiment, the Prince of Wales
has seen fit to repudiate his agreemen;
with the premier American Jockey.
American jockeys and I do not welcome
the Influx of their 'followers, who consider
horse racinp merely as an instrument for
hib'h gambling."
Proceeding to detail Sloan's suspensions
and reprimands, he observed: "I don't
think it right in the interests of the turf
that Sloan should be a. prominent buyer
at the Doncaster yearling sales or that
one of his followers should be the Ameri
can trainer for whom he has been en
deavoring to obtain a license at New
market.-
- "Martin has twice been disqualified this
year, and Rigby was reprimanded at the
Liverpool July cup: but the warning has
no effect on Rigby's reckless riding. His
performances at Gatwick last week were
distinctly dangerous.

KID PARKER WINS
FROM JACK KANE
Knocks Out the San Fran
ciscan After a Furious
Fight.
DENVER. Oct. 30.-Before the Olympic
Club to-night Kid Parker of Denver
knocked out Jack Kane of San Francisco
In the fifth round of what was to have
been a ten-round go. The fighting was
under straight Queensberry rules and waa
fast and furious after the first round.
Kane went to the floor for nine seconds
in the fourth round and again in the fifth
round before the finish came. He put up
a wonderfully game fight; and in the
third round, which was his best, he put
Parker to his knees for several . seconds
by a hard right hook to the chin. ..
In the fourth round the fighting was
vicious. Parker Jabbed his left to Kane's
nose bringing the blood, - and the latter
swung, heavily on Parker's head with his
right, sending him again to hlB knees. He
got on his feet and they went at each
other hammer and tongs, both falling to
the floor. Kane being on top. " Kane got to
bis feet hurriedly, Parker following slow-
quested the presence of Commissioners
Kreud, Quinn and McCarthy and Chief
Examiner Moran at a conference, which
was held in the rooms of the Merchants'
Association last night. Mr. Dohrmann
said he felt that It was due to the people
of this community, who had expressed
their desire for the civil service as con
tained in the charter which was adopted
at the last election, that a satisfactory
statement should hÂ« made by the commis
sion. Mr. Dohrmann, as well as the mem
bers of the commission, fully realize that
the act of the Civil Service Board in rais
ing the percentage of an applicant, which
made it possible for him to retain a posi
tion which he certainly would have lost
had he remained in the place originally
accorded him by the Board of Examiners,
would subject the board to considerable
unfavorable criticism. The action of the
commission demanded more than a pass-
Ing explanation. The fact that ten others
were raifed simultaneously with Leavy
does not affect the situation, since it is a
fact that not one of these ten has been
appointed to a bookkeepers' position In
the Board of Public Works. Leavy was
the only one who profited by the change.
The three members of the commission
met Mr. Dohrmann at . the conference,
though In justice to Commissioner Mc-
Carthy It must be said that he was In
Pennsylvania when the specific act of
raising Leavy's examination papers was
accomplished. After an hour's delib
eration in executive session the com
mission gave out a detailed statement in
explanation of Its course. This statement,
together with the opinions of F. W. Dohr
mann. is published In full elsewhere. The
statement of the commission contains an
admission that the papers were revised
and that Leavy's rating was consequently
Increased. This positive fact is not de
nied, but the commission takes refuge be
hind Its positive assertion that Leavy's
Identity was not known to the commission
and that there was no intention to make
it possible for Leavy to retain his posi
tion.
. Alleged Telephone Conversation.
The fact that Leavy was originally sixth
on the eligible Hst became known in some
unaccountable manner as far back aa Sep
tember 18 last to J. Leo Park, secretary
of the Board of Public Works. The ac
cusation Is mAde that Park secured this
interesting bit of information from Chief
Examiner Moran over the telephone. This,
however, is denied point blank by both
Park and Moran. However that may be,
Park expressed much disappointment
when he learned that Leavy stood sixth.
"Something must be done," Bald Park
to one of his intimates. "We cannot get
along without Leavy."
What that "something" was Is not
known, but the charge Is made that later
in the day Park and Commissioner Freud
were seen coming out of the Mayor's pri
vate office together. This simultaneous
exit of Park and Freud from thÂ© Mayor's
office may have been but a coincidence.
Both Park and Freud deny with some in
dignation that they were 4 In the Mayor's
presence- together. Freud claims that It la
evidently a case of mistaken identity. He
says that he has never seen the Mayor
without having one of the other Commis
sioners with him or else In company of
Chief Examiner Moran. Furthermore,
Freud states with equal posltiveness that
When the fact that Leavy's examina
tion papers had been raised became public
property the commission claimed to be
staggered. F. W. Dohrmann, president of
the Merchants Association, upon whose
recommendation Mayor Phelan appointed
Freud as a member of the Civil Service
Commission, was surprised beyond meas
ure. Mr. Dohrmann has ever been a stanch
adherent of the merit system. It was his
ambition that the civil service system
should replace the old method of political
preference In the appointment of the city's
employes, and In this laudable effort he
was supported by the merchants of this
city.
Mr. Dohrmann thought the matter of so
much Importance that he immediately re-
Dohrmann Calls Conference.
The fact remains nevertheless that pre
vious to the reduction in the time for ex
perience Leavy stood sixth on the eligible
Uft of bookkeepers, to which position h^
had been assigned by tne board of ex
amination. It must be known, too, that
examination papers are marked without
the identity of the applicants being known
to the examiners. For this purpose an
identification sheet is used for each ar>
pllcant. which is not opened until after
the papers have been marked.
After the results had been reported by
the examiners the commission, with the
full knowledge of the identity of the vari
ous applicants, took it upon Itself to
change the rating of the applicants by
changing the weight for experience. In
this way Leavy sprang to third pÂ»acÂ« and
was appointed to the position which he
has held since the commencement of the
present administration. It is equally cer
tain that if Leavy had remained in sixth
place he would not have been selected for
the position. There were only three such
positions to be filled in the Board of Pub
lic Works and as a consequence the com
mission could only certify to the five first
names for-1 the three positions. Three
names are certified for each position but
after an eligible is selected the remaining
two are dropped to be taken up again
when requisition is made for the second
position, and so on. It is easily seen that
had Leavy been permitted to remain in
sixth place he would have been ex
cluded from appointment to either of the
three positions.
Leavy Stood Sixth.
THE Board of Civil Service Com
missioners has committed an of
ficial act which strikes a death
blow to the merit system which
the present administration hrfs
made a pretense of introducing into the
municipal government. By raising: the
percentage of Leonard S. Leavy, â¢who
took the examination for Bookkeeper in
the office of the Board of Public Works, it
made it possible for Leavy to retain his
present position In that department of the
city. J. Richard Freud, president of the
Civil Service Board, who is the active
member of that body, admits that the
credits given to Leavy by the board of
examiners were raised from S5 to S3 per
cent, which at the same time raised him
from sixth to third place on the eligible
list. Freud, however, says in exfenuatlon
of this questionable proceeding that
Leavy's rating- was not raised in order to
permit of his being- retained as booK
keeper in the Board of Public Works:
Freud asserts with emphasis that the
commission had decided after the exam
ination papers had been marked by the
board of examiners that the maximum
of ten years* experience as bookkeeper
required In the. Board of Works test waa
too great. The fact that only two years'
experience was required of the applicants
for positions as bookkeepers In the Sher
iff's office Induced the Civil Service Com
mission to reduce the maximum of expe
rience required In the Board of Public
"Works from ten .to five; years. Freud
solemnly declares that the commission
did not know that this reduction would
injure or benefit any one of the applicants.
He pays that as a result of the board'*
action the rating of ten other applicants
besides Leavy was changed. 'Â¦"â¢--

There was. absolutely no other reason for this
chouse. It was not done to benefit or Injure
any . applicant. The relative rank of Mr.
Leavy on the eligible list was not known to
the commission when the experience , schedule
The. only reason for the change in the sched
ule of experience for the - bookkeepers' exam
ination In the Board of Public Works waa the
sreat disparity between the time list for the
Board of Public Works - and â¢ that set for the
Sheriff's office. In the case of the Sheriff's
office the maximum time was fixed at two
years, whereas for the Board of Public Works
it was fixed at ten years. As the position Is
a bookkeeper in each case and receives the
same salary, the Civil Service Commission con
sidered the difference too great. Accordlnrly
it was reduced from ten years to five years.
The official statement Issued by the
Civil Service * Commission explains Its
reasons for the change in the schedule
of experience, but- is silent as to the
notorious fact- that Leavy was ' jumped
from sixth. to third place, and the conse
quent retaining of. Leavy, In his position.
The statement follows:
Statement of : Commission.
The dangerous part in the proceeding
of changing the rating of civil service ap
plicants after their Identity has become
known, which was the case when the
examination papers of the bookkeepers in
the office of the Board of Public Works
were revised by the commission, is ap
parent. The only safeguard to protect
the civil service applicant lies in the fact
that his identity Is unknown to the Board
of Examiners until after his papers have
been . marked. Then the identification
sheet is torn open and the credits for his
experience is marked upon it. In Leavy's
case the Board of Examiners, consisting
of John Pettee, Cyril Williams and S. P.
Johnston, had marked his papers aa fol
lows:
Experience 80, bookkeeping . 70, general
knowledge 100, letter writing 90.
â¢ By a system of weights accorded to
each subject Leavy's percentage was as
certained to be 85. This made him sixth
on the list. It was then that i the com
mission changed the figures for experi
ence from SO to 100, as- a result of the re
duction In experience necessary for a
perfect credit, - which increased his total
percentage to 89. Â¦ ,
Changing the Figures.
It is a fact, however, that two or three
days after Park's lamentable discovery
that his friend Leavy stood sixth on the
eligible list the list of successful candi
dates for the position of bookkeeper in the
office of the Board of- Public Works was
announced, and lo and behold, Leavy 's
name appeared third instead of sixth. The
reduction In the maximum of experience
from ten to five years had operated to
Leavy's benefit. The day afterward the
Board of Public Works made a requisition
for two bookkeepers. The names of the
four highest on the list were sent to It by
the commission, and T. J. Crowley and
Leonard S. Leavy, both of whom were ap
pointed by the board last January, were
selected to fill their own positions.

I do Dot desire to sro Into particulars In re
gard to these charges. The commission la
amply able to speak for Itself and -to explain
ita motives as well as Us actions. I am glad
to state, however, that I have no reason to
doubt that any action they have taken In this
particular matter, as well as generally, has
been prompted by a sincere desire to make the
efforts I of the commission effective and to be
fair and Just to all applicants, without per
sonal preference, all of which is borne out by
the results of their previous work and shown In
the personnel of the appointees under the new
system, as well as by the fact that all their
examinations have . been i public and all the
papers are subject to full investigation. In
addition, the , standing of these gentlemen In
other callings has been such that they are. In
my Judgment, certainly . entitled to the full,
absolute and unqualified confidence of this
community. *
I exceedingly regret the. charges that the
Civil Service' Commission, particularly Mr.
Freud, has caused certain actions to be taken
in order to favor an applicant for the posi
tion of bookkeeper in the Board of Public
Works. â¢
The directors of the Merchants" Association
permitted Its secretary, Mr. Freud, to become a
member of the Civil Service Commission for thÂ©
sole purpose that civil service might be intro
duced under the new charter fairly, intelli
gently, honestly and without reference to poli
tical parties or party services. In consequence
It became my 'duty as president of the Mer
chants' Association to keep In close touch with
the work of Â¦ the commission, and therefore I
feel' that I am in a position to state that bo far
as results have- been obtained and considering
the many obstacles and difficulties which had
to be overcome and the opposition which had
to bo met with, the results of the work of
this commission, so far as they have been at
tained, have fully Justified the hopes and con
fidence of all friends of civil service reform.
Immediately after the conference last
night, Mr. Dohrmann, as representative
of the Merchants' Association, stated as
tho result of the investigation that tho
Civil Service Commission could only be
accused of being indiscret In changing the
schedule of experience. He expressed con
fidence In the commission, 1 however, and
dictated the following:
Dohrmann Defends Commission.
"The changing of the maximum time
required for experience in the bookkeep
er s examination was entirely an Imper
sonal matter." said Mr. Freud at the close
of the conference with President Dohr
m ,ann of the Merchants' Association. "The
Civil Service Commission has all along
reserved to Itself the ri#ht to revise the
work of the board of examiners in mark
ing examination papers. When we con
cluded to reduce the experience require
ment no eligible list had been made by
the commission, though the papers had
been marked by the examiners. Though
tne Identification sheets were open the
applicants were unknown to either Mr.
Quinn or myself. That is. we paid no at
tention to the names of the applicants.
u e believed that the commission would
be subjected to unfavorable criticism for
unfavorable discrimination In requiring
ten years' experience for bookkeepers in
the Board of Public Works and only two
years for Sheriff's bookkeepers. We
therefore determined to equalize matters
by reducing the maximum limit for the
Board of Public Works.
"At no time has the commission been
approached in the interest of Leavy or
any other man In or out of the City Hall
Mr. Quinn and myself had never spoken
about Leavy. I have never seen tho
Mayor In the presence of Park nor has the
latter ever spoken to me. about Leavy."
Freud Explains.
the commission about the examination, certifi
cation or appointment of Mr. Leavy.
Mr. Freud did not at any time visit the of
fice of Mayor Phelan with Secretary Park, nor
was ho ever in the office of Mayor Phelan at
the same time as Secretary Park. Neither
Secretary Park nor Mayor Phelan nor any
other person In the city government ever spoke
to Mr. Freud concerning the examination or
certification or appointment of Mr. Leavy.
In none of the rulings of the Civil Service
Commission has there ever been the slightest
Intention to injure or benefit any acDllcant.
The decisions of the commission In all mat
ters are -made without regard to any r>erson
or any aDDllcant. Notwithstanding any state
ments that may be published to the contrary,
the Civil .Service Commission feels assured
that any impartial Investigation of Us work
v.-lll justify the declaration that not the slight
est favoritism has ever be*-n shown. All the
proceedings of the commission are open to the
j Dviblic and all examination papers and other
documents are always open and' free to public
inspection. The commission cordially Invites
any citizen to visit Its office and will afford
every facility for a fair and full Investigation
: of Its proceedings.

the infected district has been established
and disinfectants and vaccine have been

From - a scientific standpoint the , men
were about 'evenly matched, and It ;was
Parker's strength that did Â¦;; the work."
Parker weighed; in this . afternoon Â¦ at 131*4
pounds, Kane at 133 pounds.' A fair sized
crowd saw the fight./
ly. They mixed It up again, and a series
of hard rights put Kane groggy. Parker
followed him up with right and . left
swings and Kane went down for nine sec
onds. He gt)t up very groggy and Parker
waded Into him to finish him. The gong
saved Kane. Â¦ ; .
In t*he fifth round Kane came up weak
and Parker started after him with right
and left swings to the chin, nose -.and
head, with an occasional stiff right
straight to the heart. Kane' went down
again for nine seconds. With . blood all
over his face and breast, Kane rose slow
ly to his feet and snot his right to Par
ker's head, following it with lefts and
rights to body and head, dazing the Den
ver boy. It looked, as though Kane. had
Becureq a new lease of life, and the crowd
went wild with excitement.. But l Parker
began again to make a punching bag of
Kane's head and gradually wore him
down so that he could not hold up his
arms to defend himself finally falling
over on the mat when Referee Cullin
counted him out. Kane got ' up and
dragged: himself to his corner and sat
down groaning with pain. , .Â¦Â¦, ..
Kane's wonderful gameness i. and vital
ity was the comment of all, and when he
looked about gone he .would- frequently
whip his right over on Parker's head,'

TRANSPORT MEADE IN PORT WITH
MANY OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
Lieutenant Colonel Springer Brings Home the Remains of His
Only Son, Who Was Shot Down by the Filipinos.
"Have you any plans, Mr. Baldwin?"
"I shall see . Hull McGlaughry," said
"Lucky." At this moment and before he
could enlarge on his new son-in-law a
bellboy entered with pens. Ink and paper
and with a wave of his hand "Lucky"
signified his desire to be left with the
muses. Â¦ . ; â¢
"Not what It was cracked up to be," re
plied "Lucky," completing the sentence.
"Lucky's" literary labors will commenco
to-day, so he says. Maybe thÂ© Ellen Ter
ry blonde was his stenographer.
"Are you glad to be back In San Fran
cisco, Mr. Baldwin?" was asked.
"My hist"â began "Lucky,'-' and then
the blonde broke in â --v-.
"Ot course he Is."
E^ J. BALDWIN, known from
Xome to New York- as
"Lucky," returned to San
â¢ Francisco from the former
place yesterday morning and
registered at the Baldwin Annex.
Although the sun snone out yesterday
afternoon Mr. Baldwin stood in the bay
window of suite No. 2 in an overcoat.
He has grown stouter, but this is the only
Indication that Nome has agreed wit'a
him.
Scarcely had "Lucky" taken up his seat
In the window when the frou-frou of
skirts outside his door caused him with
his well-known gallantry to seek his feet.
It was his daughter, Anita, whose
graceful form, clad 'n a smart frock of
red, sank in a peaceful heap at "Lucky's"
feet and wept. "Lucky" patted the bru â¢
nette's head laid so confidingly on his
paternal knee. The air grew moist with
sobs. The carpet resembled the tundra.
"Leave me with my daughter," said the
man from Nome, and those who had as
sembled to do him reverence and others
withdrew.
After Anita, radiant, had left her parent
"Lucky" held a levee, during which his
friends asked Questions and he looked
wise. '. - . Â¦
"I am writing a history of my adven
tures In Nome," said tne returned adven
turer, "which I shall take around to the
newspapers."
"Did you do well In Nome?" was asked
of the old man.
"I am writing a history," was his re
ply.
"Can you not tell us If the prospects
there are what they are represented to
be?"
"I am writing a history," and "Lucky"
swelled with importance.
"Do you Intend to return there, Mr.
Baldwin?"
"My history will tell."
"Do you believe the claims you have
taken up will prove to be rich?"
"Look in my history."
At this stage of the interview a Burne-
Jones blonde; with an Ellen Terry chin,
sailed into the room.
"Why. E. J.," said this vision. In great
apparent surprise at tho old gentleman In
the window.
"Why, Laura. Is that you?" said "E. J."
in response, and Laura coyly admitted her
identity.
"Have you heard I am. writing a his
tory?" said "Lucky" to Laura.
"Why, no! A history!"
"Yes; for the. newspapers."
"You will sell It to them?" '
"I suppose so," with a glance at the
interviewer.
"Then Nome is"â
SOLDIER'S BREAK
FOR LIBERTY IS
UNSUCCESSFUL
Shot at Several Times, but
Succeeds in Reaching
Cover.
?
But He Is Found in a Ditch by the
Corporal of the Guards â I>is
charged Soldier Loses
His Reason.
Seven shots fired In rapid succession
startled the residents near the Presidio
yesterday and caused many of thCsol
diers to think that they were once again
on the firing line. The cause of the fusil
lade vras the dash for liberty of one of the
general prisoners. Under charge of the
guard, the prisoners were being brought
back to work. , They were marching close
to the board walk near the entrance to
the grounds, when William Johnson, who j
is serving a sentence of five years, cleared
the railing: at a bound and disappeared
In the bui-hes. Shot after snot was fired,
but the tret s prevented any expert marks
manship. The corporal of the pruard fol
lowed the desperate fellow into the under
brush for several hundred yards and final
ly located him in a ditch. He was hauled
out and Font bo work with the rest of the
eo-ng. As a rule once a prisoner gets into
the dense woods in the neighborhood of |
the. Presidio his escape is almost certain.!
the' recapture of this ir.an being the Jlrst
in many attempts. He will be confined In
the dungeons at Aloatruz for several days
and in addition will lo^e the credits gain
ed by him for good behavior.
James Ross, a discharged soldier, ap
peared at tho Presidio yesterday for ex
amination as to his sanity. He acted in a j
perfectly sane manner until the attend
ants a-tiempted to lead him to the insane
ward, when he became violent,' and It re
quired several men to carry him there
and conflm him in the padded cell. He
will be turned over to the city authorities.
The ttsting of the guns and mortars at
the Presidio, under the supervision of
Captain Orozier. still goes on. Yesterday
the 10-inch puns mounted on disappearing \
carriages were fired several times and
worked to the entire satisfaction of the
ordnance expert.
Thirteen volunteers were discharged
yesterday. The manner In which the men
are discharged makes it possible for the
officers to handle a large number during
the day.
The following order has been Issued:
"Colonel Samuel M. Mansfield is relieved
from his present duties at San Francisco,
to take effect November 23, and will pro
ceed to and take station at Cleveland,
Ohio, and relieve Colonel Jared A. Smith
of the duties now In his charge. Colonel j
Smith upon being thus relieved will pro- I
ceed to and take station at San Fran
cisco and asjume the duties of division
engineer of the Pacific Division and all
other duties now in chaxge of Colonel
Mansfield."

Want to Pay by Certificate.
The Merchants* Association Is striving
to have the custom prevailing In New
York City of paying customs charges by
bank certificates introduced into this city,
and with this end in view Secretary
Freud has been in correspondence with
the Merchants' Association of New York
regarding the plan. At present the duty
charges are paid by cash, which mean.i
the expending of a large amount of tlmo
and labor by local banking institutions.
Secretary Freud has forwarded to.eacn
bank belonging to the San Francisco
clearing-house a copy of the information
received on the subject, together with an
explanatory letter urging the desirability
of securing the early establishment of tho
custom in this city. In all. probability r
petition will be sent to the Treasury De

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â The probable
collapse of the movement that has threat
ened to result In the removal of Shawnee.
Delaware and other. Indian bands to Mex
ico, Is announced in a report received at
the Interior Department from Assistant
Special Agent Bentley. telling of the death
of two Indian chiefs who led in the pro
ject.
The report announces that "Big Jim,"
principal chief of his band of'Shawnees,
died at Sablnas, Mex.. September 30, of
smallpox, and that Jack Harris, one of
the chiefs of the Delawares, who accom
panied Big Jim. died the same day of the
same illness. Big Jim's party consisted oi
six persons, four of whom died. These
two chiefs were bitterly opposed to civili
zation and their amBition for years has
been to move their people to Mexico, there
to live in exclusion, away from the white
man and his influences.- Their death, the
agents thinks, will result In the total
abandonment of any further disposition
on the part of their people to leave the
United States. The report says that in
stead of being received with open arms
in Mexico, as the chiefs had anticipated,
when stricken with the disease the Mexi
can authorities refused them shelter or
aid of any kind and they were compelled
to He in the brush and their party was
compelled to pay Â¥1 for tho privilege of
burial. A* son of one of the victims
brought the details from Mexico.

FERRER'S EXAMINATION
ON A CHARGE OF MURDER
All the Witnesses for the Prosecution
Testify and the Defense Gets
a Continuance.
The preliminary examination of Nash
Ferrer, charged with the murder of M. J:
Sullivan by stabbing him on the head
with a knife, was commenced before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday afternoon. The
defendant was represented by Attorney
Mack.
The evidence of the witnesses for the
prosecution showed that Ferrer, who was
a stableman with Sullivan & Doyle, Sixth
and Clara streets, was drunk and had
asked Sullivan for his wages. Sullivan
told him to come back when he was sober
and from words they came .to blows.
Ferrer was knocked down and kicked
several times by Sullivan. Ferrer went
to a trough and washed the blood from
his face and about five minutes later,
when Sullivan was talking to some one,
Ferrer came behind him and plunged
the knife into his head. He died a few
days afterward In St. Mary's Hospital.
The case for the prosecution was closed
and the defense asked for a continuance,
which was granted till November 7, Â¦ the
day after the election.
THE PILGRIMAGE
TO MEXICO
Ancient Scenes of the Montezumas
to Be Visited.
ThÂ© Southern Pacific, which Is organiz
ing a Pullman train excursion to the City
of Mexico and has announced Its depart
ure from San Francisco on November 14.
has just issued a neatly printed Itinerary
of the trip. It contains mention of all
the interesting cities and scenes that will
or may be visited, how to reach them,
how long it will take and the cost. For
those who will join the excursion it will
be a valuable guide, and whether, or not.
It contains much interesting Information
about a quaint and curious country. It
can be obtained of Southern' Pacific
agents anywhere.
"I am receiving Inquiries about this ex
cursion from all- parts of the country,"
said Excursion Agent Menton yesterday,
"and a goodly number have signified their
Intention of going. We expect to have a
fine party and there is no doubt but that
the trip will be both interesting and prof
itable.
"We will arrive In the Mexican capital
on November 19 and remain there one
week, during which side trips will be
planned to Puebla, Cordoba, oaxaca and
Cuernavaca, and on the homeward trip
we will Include Guadalajara and Guana
juato, on branch lines, besides Aguas Call
entes, Zacatecas and Chihuahua on the
main line. Our stops will vary from two
or three hours to a day In each place."
As a result of Supervisor .: McCarthy's
action In directing attention to the illegal
practice of borrowing Irom certain funds
in the city treasury to pay demands on the
general fund the officials In that office
decided yesterday not to pay any de
mands for this month until money begins
to accumulate from tex collections. A3
Tax Collector Scott states that very little

When McCarthy called attention' to the
practice mentioned of borrowing from
certain funds to pay demands on others,
which is not countenanced by the char
ter, he ascertained that the enormous
sum of $300,000 in paid demr^ls was be
ing carried as cash on the treasurer's
books. McCarthy state<J thatlif the prac
tice was continued that sum N/ould be in
creased to $500,000 after the October de
mands had been paid. â¢
The treasury officials are well aware
that they have been violating the charter,
but defend their course by saying 'that
the custom of borrowing from funds ha*
prevailed in the city, government for
years. C-< .
The charter, however, prohibits the
practice. For that reason the demands
were refused payment yesterday and w-',
registered in the order of their pres^j-^T
tion. Deputy Rels said that it had bec-a
decided to compl; witÂ£ the charter as a
result of McCarthy's strictures on the ad
ministration of afrairs In the Treasurers
office.
"There is more than half a million dol
lars in the city t easury ut the present
time," says Rels, 'but it belongs to other
funds and cannot be borrowed to pay sal
ary demands."
This admission is interesting in view of
the fact that this Is exactly what has
been done during the three months last
past, though the charter does not permit
such a course.
McCarthy was to have presented his
case yesterday to the Supervisors'
Finance Committee, which has been di
rected by the board to investigate tho
payment by the Treasurer of unregis
tered demands In advance of those legally
registered. In the absence of Chairman
Jennings, who is ill. the nn-eting wa3
postponed until this afternoon. Some plan
may then be devised so that creditors of
the city will get their October money at
once. Deputy Treasurers Perkins and
Rels will be present at the conference.
As a Consequence Demands Will Be
Registered in Order of Presenta
tion Until Tax Collec
tions Accumulate.

It goes without saying the suggestion of "Commer
cial Travelers' day" has met with a ready response.
Many of the largest organizations in the country
have expressed their cordial co-operation with it, and
no pains will be. spared to make the day memorable
in the campaign. Speaking of the plans for the day,
H. C. Payne, vice chairman of the- Republican Na
tional Committee, is reported to have said: "Never
in the history of' the Republican party has the Na
tional'Committee expended such efforts to reach the
commercial travelers' vote as in this campaign. HÂ»
added: "While we may not have as many voters* to
convert as in previous yÂ«rs, there has been an im
mense amount of work done, and the results show
Â¦beyond any doubt that the commercial travelers who
are with us are well in the majority."
The mass-meetings to be held during the day and
evening in the larger cities of the Union will be a"
fitting close to the brilliant "campaign for .sound
money and expanding business. It is fitting that these
final rallies should be especially marked by commer
cial travelers, for, the title given -to McKinley four
years ago, "the advance agent of prosperity," is on*
borrowed from their own profession. No class -of
people* have profited " more by. the return of business
ONE of the notable features which the Repub
lican National Committee has arranged for
the closing days of the Campaign is that of
fixing Saturday, November 3, as "Commercial Trav
elers' day" and making plans -for a grand rally
throughout the country in celebration of the occasion.
Commercial travelers constitute one of the most in
fluential elements of American life. No other class
of workers come in contact day after day with so
many business men in such widely separated localities.
Each commercial traveler has an extensive range of
territory to cover, and in the aggregate they sweep
the whole Union. Their acquaintances include the
entire mass of those who carry on our manufacturing
and mercantile activity. Going everywhere and talk
ing business continually in cities, towns, villages, and
even in the country stores by the cross roads, the
commercial traveler is always in close touch with the
trade ofuhe people. He knows fetter than any one
else when times are prosperous for all and when they
are bad. Consequently the vote of the commercial
travelers as a body is always of great significance. The
Bryanites have repeatedly decjared that in this cam
paign the commercial men are with them, and now
the Republican rally on Saturday night is to demon
strate to the country the falseness and futility of that
boast.
COMMERCIAL TRAVELERS' DAY.
With this period of prosperity^which'is now bright
ening around us there 5 will be- a -strong impetus
toward all forms of public improvements. It is there
fore timely, for . us. to provide a means to undertake
them in the * way that will be most economical. The
United States loses nothing by exempting its bonds
from taxation. Neither will California. . This amend
ment, therefore, ought to have universal support
We have then these three benefits to gain from the
proposed exemptionâ firÂ«t,' we will be able to borrow
money , for public improvements more ; cheaply ; sec
ond, we will be able to use such bonds. at hometfor
the investment of savings, and third, we will retain
in the State the monev that is now sent away in the
payment of interest to outside holders. These' gains
will hardly be offset in any way. for, in the first place,
the amdunt of tax received from the bonds is slight;
and, in. the second / place, it; is more- than.counterbal
anced by the increased rate of interest which the tax
ation compels us to pay. -
In the second place the tax causes a loss to the
State, owing to the fact that if the bonds be sold to
persons living outside the State California Assessors
and Tax Collectors cannot reach them. Thus an out
side holder of such, bonds docs not have to pay the
tax, while the local holder does. There is thus an
advantage on the part of the outsider. That radvan
tage is such as to lead to the sale of a Very large pro
portion of such bonds to non-residents. The conse
quence is that when' interest is due it ; is paid r out of
the State instead of within the State. There "is thus
a heavy drain of money from California that is se
verely^felt in the channels of trade.
In the first place it is to be noted that nothing is
gained to a community by taxing its own bonds.
Every cent of taxation has to be counterbalanced by
an increase of interest, or else the bonds will have to
be sold at a discount- The lender expects to receive
a certain interest for his money, and if the loan is to
be taxed he demands interest enough to make up for
the tax. All California communities : will be able to
borrow money more cheaply for improvements if ths
present tax be repealed.
The object of the amendment is to exempt from
taxation the bonds described, and the reasons why
the exemption should be made are many. They con
cern every locality in the State and to a considerable
extent every citizen.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Since Monterey County Judges have included at
tempts at train-wrecking in the current category of
jokes by releasing two boy wreckers because of their
tender youth, open switches appear to be popular.
The complaisant Judges ought to establish an" age
limit in which the commission of a crime is not a
Dawsonites are displaying that pride which comes
before a fall. It is said that one may now safely wear
a white shirt in the northern mining town, but the
veracious correspondents are jilent as to how one is
to get the price.
lie has appalled many by his direct incitement ot
ararchist outrage against the person of the President,
and has done what he could to dynamite the constitu
tional institutions of the country. .But through it all
his person has-been fafe from attack and he has been
free from insult or disturbance. It remains to be seen
w hcther American decency will permit the inaugura
tion of mob government by putting in power a partv
that expresses its purposes by "hisses, hoots, oaths,
shrieks and vile epithets." and has its lawless black
guardism approvingly reported by the Examiner as
""enthusiasm for Brvan."
Bryan himself has frone up an3 down the country
making violent and untruthful accusations against the
President of the United States.' He has attacked,
vilely and indiscriminately, all ot his countrymen who
are cnerpi^ing: our industries and promoting our com
merce. He has indulged in the most licentious style
of speech and has promoted disorder and disgrace in
nearly every tpeech he has made. "But his opponents
have heard him patiently and let him come, talk and
go on in peace.
All this is the very essence of Bryanism. It is the
outward and physical expression of the inward spirit
oi the Bryan party. The organized indecency of the
country is on the side of the Nebraskan. and it re
mains for the decency, good order and law abiding
s j-irit of the American people to decide whether it
wants to aid in making good the promise of the Bryan
mob.
The crowning act in this mob campaign has just
occurred in Xew York, at Elmira, the home of the
Bryan candidate for Governor, Mr. Stanchfield. The
Examiner prints the account of this last outrage with
out a word of rebuke, but over its "longest leased line
in the world"* speaks of it as 'enthusiasm for Bryan,
â¢nd admits that in the attacking mob were "many
Democrats of respectability." In its account, which

"The Governor's carriage was hemmed in* by a howl;

the cleanest kind of a licking on election day.".

to high favor. To efface this impression it became

MOB GOVERNMENT.
PA8SING through the constellation of Perseus there Is a tsall orb abect
twenty miles in diameter which 1* at present* the most observed object In
the, universe: every sizable telescope Is on Its track and over tliirty leading
observatories have undertaken to co-operate In a systematic watch of its
movements and aspects. Around the globel from north to wrath, rlast
cameras, adroit hellometers and delicate photometers are in use from dusk to day
break as the unconscious wanderer approaches earthward. Though named Eros.
its sba'ts are not those of love, but of knowledge, for It may discloss a. loag
locked secret before the dawn of the twentieth century.
An accurate estimate of the distance of the sun has never been obtained &s
yet.
Notwithstanding the great improvement In astronomical Instruments and the
llet of eminent names connected with efforts to obtain the solar parallax, the prob
lem is of such difflculty that the present estimate of the sun's distance, namely,
92,837,000 miles, may be several hundreds of thousands in error. This uncertainty
is all the more tantalizing as the relative distances of the earth and placets from
the central orb are known with remarkable accuracy.
1 It is curious and interesting that the opening day of the present century is tis
date of the first discovery of an asteroid, and that this important Â¦ solar computa
tion should be facilitated by one of these minor planets at its close.
Ceres, the first found, was greeted with enthusiasm, as its existence was the
realization of a theory held by Kepler and other astronomers that the seemisg
void of 3CO.CO9.000 of miles between the orblt3 of Mars and Jupiter was not altogeth
er a planetary waste. However, as the century advanced acd these small bodies
were found to number hundreds Interest waned, and It was even suggested by
leading astronomers that they be permitted to wander around unwatched aad un
known. Fortunately this course was not adopted, and on the 13th of August. 1S3S.
when Witt, an observer of Berlin, discovered "number~453, since christened Eros. Its
orbit round .the sun was carefully computed, a? usuaL With deep interest It was
learned that its elliptical path was not confined to the supposed asteroid realm,
but at one point came within 15.0W.0CO of miles of the earth's path. Wbta
both bodies are near these adjacent points at the same time the asteroid Is by
far the nearest of the heavenly bodies, excepting ths moon. This juxtaposition,
however. Is Infrequent.'
In â¬43 days Eros completes a revolution, b*>ing 1S3.0CO.W0 miles from tfcs sun at
aphelion and only 105,005.000 at perihelion. These points having a nearly opposite
direction from the similar points in the orbit of Mars. Eros curves far within It la
a portion of its path and beyond it in the remaining portion, as shown in the ac
companying: diagram. Accordingly it varies in apparent size from about seventh
to thirteenth stellar magnitude. Glimmering in full luster In January, 1S34. It re
mained unnoticed or unknown, while the earth paÂ«sed closely by between it and
the sun. .
. The coming opposition in the beginning of November occurs long before this
perihelion point is reached, but as Eros continues to curve sunward until Febru
ary it approaches within 31.O00.OX) miles of our planet toward the ead of -December
next, and though this is more than double its distance at a favorable opposition
no better opportunity will occur for such measurements for at least twenty-five
years.
In these observations the absence of a visible disk and of aa atmosphere are
almost as important as decrease of distance, and far better results are hoped for
than have been obtained from the parallax of Mars or Venus. '
If two astronomers 4X0 miles apart measure at Che same moment of time the
distance of this tiny orb from an adjacent star and there is a difference of
half a minute â¢? an arc In the positions obtained, that small space will be the
angular value of 4090 miles as seen from Eros. Having thus a base line of the tri
angle formed, the relative length of the sldÂ» can be found by a trigonometrical
computation.
According to Kepler's third law. if one planetary distance is found all the di
mensions of the solar system can be then computed in miles instead of in mere
relative lengths. As the process of calculating the parallax of Eros includes many
complexities, it may be months before flaal results are fully obtained.- bet it Is
probable that the end of the century will be fitly celebrated by the news of suc
cess in this important scientific work. ROSE CHALLORAN.

LAST week The Call presented a careful estimate
of the probable vote of the various States in .
the coming election. That estimate, based upon
reports obtained by The Call and the New York Her- ;
aid from expert students of politics in all parts of the ;
count ry,' was undoubtedly the most reliable that had j
been made up to that time. The course of the cam
paign since the repents were obtained /.as' not ma
terially changed the situation, but none the less it will
be interesting to direct attention to estimates re
cently given out from the New York headquarters of
e?ch of the two parties.

It will be perceived that in these tables no reference
is made to doubtful States. The managers of each
party claim to have conceded to the opposition every
State considered at ell doubtful. Thus the Republi
can estimates allow Bryan 163, but the claim is at the
same time made that the Republicans are more likely
to carry} Idaho, Montana, Kentucky and Nebraska,
with their total of twenty-seven votes, than are thÂ«
Democrats. The doubtful States likely to go for
Bryan are conceded to be Colorado, Nevada and
Missouri, with a total of twenty-four votes. On the
other hand, the Democrats claim that some of the
doubtful States they have "conceded" to McKinley
are likely to go for Bryan.
These estimates from political headquarters are not
so reliable as those obtained by .the canvass of The
Call and the Herald, but they are quite as interesting
in their way, showing, as they do, the comparative
methods of the managers of the two parties in dealing
with/the public. The Republican estimate is essen
tially a fair one. Hardly any intelligent Democrat
can doubt that it has been honestly made up. It
may be affected by party enthusiasm and bias; but it
is unquestionably a serious effort to forecast the vote.
The Democratic table, on the contrary, is a clear case
of bluffing. The chances of Bryan to carry. Illinois,
Ohio, Wisconsin and New York are so slight that
even Democrats themselves will hardly be able to read
the claim made by their National Committee without
smiling.
CALCULATING THE VOTE.
Paul Krugcr has decided to become an agitator and
tell the nations the wrongs of the 'Transvaal. The
old man might do well in his declining days to learn
the eloquence of silence. He has some reason to ask
I that its mantle cover him.

UTTERANCE
That trumpet call to honor and honesty turned the
repudiation meeting into a public credit convention.
Douglas was elected to Congress, secured the land
grant for the Illinois Central Railroad, gave the
products of the State a market, and laid the founda
tion of her greatness. He was a builder. What a fall
from Douglas to Altgeld, Bryan, Jim Sovereign,
Tillman and Dick Croker!
"Resolved, That though Illinois may never be abl*
to pay a dollar of her public debt, so help her God, she
vrill never repudiate a penny of it."
That settled it. Mississippi immediately" repudiated
and has never recovered from the evil it wrought
upon her public credit. The purpose of her Governor
was purely destructive, and he accomplished it by an
appeal to prejudice. Bryan's method is exactly the
S2me. He has- never had a constructive policy or pro
posed to use what is excellent in existing conditions
as a foundation, on which to build greater excellence.
It . is his policy that has driven business men and
laboring men of intelligence out of his party. The
old Democracy was not destructive. It was construc
tive. The men who believed in it do not believe in
Bryan. The great leaders whom they followed were
builders, and not political incendiaries. Mr. Bryan,
like the Governor of Mississippi, disregards the need
cf good public credit. He proposes to repudiate pub
lic obligations and violate private contracts, regard
less of the effect upon public credit or private pros
perity. He has usurped a leadership that once was
held by Stephen A. Douglas. What a contrast be
tween the two! When Illinois, new and weak, with
no transportation for her surplus to a distant mar
ket, felt the pressure of her public debt and pro
posed to repudiate it, and called a convention for that
purpose, Douglas, then younger than Bryan is now,
came to the-support of public credit and public honor.
When the repudiation convention met he was ill in
Springfield, but from his sickroom sent to the con
vention this resolution: /
When the State of Mississippi was urged to repu
diate her bonds the demagogues gave no. other rea
son than that they were owned by Rothschild. The
Governor of that State in his repudiation message to
the Legislature said: "These bonds have been hy
pothecated and are owned by Rothschild, a descend
ant of Judas and Shylock, and possessing, the evil
instincts of both his ancestors. He has loaned money
to the Sublime Porte, and for security holds a mort
gage on the city of Jerusalem and the sepulcher of
Christ."
His continual harping on trusts is not caused by
any evil in trusts, nor is "it accompanied by any clear
idea of a remedy. Its motive is the desire to arouse
prejudice. He has simply substituted trusts for
"Wall street," as Wall street was substituted for th
more ancient bog}', "Rothschild." Whenever dema
gogues in this country have sought to lead the people
in the path of destruction they have used a bogy.
The laborer of course answered that he would like
to do better, though he felt that he was doing well.
Bryan then proceeded to denounce conditions under
which every man could not do as well as he wished to
do. - In this sinister way he seeks to arou=e discon
tent, not of the son that is thankful for what is and
hopes for something better, but of that kind that may
be led to hate and destroy what is, treating it as in
imical to human welfare.
During his present campaign he had personal coh-
Uct with a laboring man, who said that he was doing
Â¦very well now, as the revival of industry had given
him steady work and wages. To this Bryan replied,
"Are you doing as well as you would like tor"
Â« From -his beginning in public lHe'Mr: Bryan has
been against everything that is^. His political philos
ophy'urges him to advocate the rebuilding of human
society on its failures and diseases, treating its suc
cess and health as an outrage on humanity. His plat
forms contain no constructive principle. They pro
pose to destroj- and not to build. His speeches are
negations.

DUTIES OF AN EMPLOYER OF LABOR.
Copyright, 1900,
by Seymour Eaton.
t^fW.M LESSONS t EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYES.
m. \ I
Though an employe is his own Insurer
against all ordinary risks, there is a rule
of duty for employers to fulfill which can
not be Ifcrhtly disregarded. This rule is
that an employer must exercise due or
ordinary care in selecting servants, fur
nish them with suitable appliances for
their tasks and reasonably safe places for
performing them; enough servants to per
form-in a reasonably safe manner the
specific thing they have to do; and. lastly,
proper regulations or instructions when
ever they are needed- Every clause in this
rule is full of meaning, and we shall be
gin by Inquiring what is meant by the
term ordinary care, which an employer
must exercise in doing the above men
tioned duty.
What Is Ordinary Care P
In denning this term the Supreme Court
of Vermont has remarked that a man In
any situation of business is always bound
.to conform to th*^ rules and usages which
prudent and careful men have set up in
the conduct of similar business under the
same conditions. This is ordinary care.
The Supreme . Court of Ohio has denned
the term in the following words: "Such
care as is most' common and usual in the
business." The Supreme Court of Massa
chusetts has dealt with the term at great
er length: "What is ordinary care cannot
be determined abstractly. It has relation
to and must be measured by the work or
thing done and the instrumentalities used,
and their capacity for evil as well as good.
What 1 would be ordinary care in one case
would be gross negligence in another. We
look to the work, its difficulties,, dangers
and responsibilities, and then say, 'What
would and should. a reasonable and pru
dent man do In such an exigency?' The
word 'ordinary' has a popular sense which
would greatly relax the rigor of the rule.
The law means by ordinary care the care
reasonable and prudent men use under
like circumstances."
An Employer's Duty in Selecting
Employes.
Having shown what the courts mean by
ordinary care, let us next inquire what is
proper care or diligence In selecting com
petent employes or servants. Surely an
employer is hardly permitted to -employ
any one he pleases without regard to his
fitness for the task he Is to undertake. If
he were to work alone then Indeed a dif
ferent rule might be applied, but when
the employe is to work with others his
employer must satisfy himself that be will
not endanger the lives of his fellow work
men by reason of his ignorance of the
common employment.
In a well-reasoned case against a rail
road company the Supreme Court of IÂ»
diana remarked that in employing its sub
ordinates it was the duty of the company
to exercise a degree of care fitting to the
positions they were to fill, and showing" a
due regard for the consequences that
might follow from employing incompetent
or unskilled men. If peculiar fitness were
required of any one it was the duty of
the company to make inquiries to that
end." In one of the earlier cases. Oilman
vs., Eastern Railroad Company, the court
remarked that .if an employer knew or in
the exercise Â¦ of due care might have
known that his employes -were Incompe
tent either at the time of hiring them or
afterward, he failed in his duty. In this
case the railroad company employed a
switchman and flagman who. so the other
side contended, was an habitual drunk
ard. To employ such a man, especially
for these positions, clearly was negli
gence. Whether or no he was a man of
this character was a fact which the Jury
decided against the company.
How, Is Incompetency Proved P
In attempting to prove that a servant
is incompetent the- Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania has said that- Incompetency
cannot be established by proof of such
acts, but must be by evidence of general
refutation. This may seem to the reader
a wrong way of looking at the matter, so
we will give Mr. Chief Justice Lowrie's
reasons for his decision. "Character for
care, skill and truth must all alike be
proved by evidence of general reputation,
and not of special acts. â¢ â¢ â¢ Character
grows out of special acts, but it is not
proved by them. Indeed, special acts do
very often indicate frailties or vices that
are altogether contrary to the character
actually established. â¢ â¢ â¢ Besides this,
ordinary care implies occasional acts of
carelessness."
This, however, is not the way other
courts have looked at this question. Said
the New York Court of Appeals in a case
against a railroad company: "Proof of
specific acts of negligence of a servant or
agent on one or more occasions does not
tend to prove negligence on the particular
occasion which is the subject of inquiry
â¢ â¢ â¢ specific acts tend to exhibit and
bring to light the peculiar qualities of the
man, and indicate his adaptation or want
of adaptation to any position or fitness or
unfitness for a particular duty or trust.
It is by many or by a series of acts that
individuals acquire a general reputation
and by which tb*ir characters are known
and described. â¢ â¢ â¢ A principal would
be without excuse should he employ for a
responsible position one known to him as
having the reputation of being an intem
perate, indolent' or careless man. â¢ â¢ â¢
Still more should he be chargeable If he
had knowledge of specific acts showing
that he possessed characteristics incom
patible with the duties assigned him. and
which might expose his fellow servants
and others to peril and harm."
What Are Safe Appliances?
The second clause of the rule defining
the duty of employers requires them to
furnish proper appliances to their em
ployes. If they fail in their duty In this
regard they must answer for the conse
quences. When one is injured by an ap
pliance the question at once arises. Did
the employer fulfill his duty in furnishing
a proper one, or was he negligent? It
must be evident, we think, to every reader
that the question, "What is a proper appli
ance? is a question of fact to be decided
whenever It arises. There have been many
cases of this kind, and we might fill much
space In describing them. An employer ia
not required to change his machinery In
order to apply every new Improvement,
even though it be much safer than the
old. All that he can demand Is that he
shall not be deceived in the risk he In
curs. Nor is an employer liable for hid
den defects of Â¦which he has no knowledge,
nor is he required to provide against dan
gers from an unnecessary and Improper
use of appliances.
In the case of Titus vs. Bradford Rail
road Company the court said that all the
cases agreed that "the master was not
bound to use the newest and best appli
ances. He did his duty when he furnished
those of ordinary character and reason
able safety, and the former was the test
of the latter. Absolute safety was not at
tainable, and employers were not Insurers.
They were liable for the consequences not
of danger but of negligence, and .the un
bending test of negligence In methods,
machinery- and appliances Is the ordinary
usage of the business. No man is held to
a higher degree of skill than the fair
average of his trade or profession, and the
standard of due care Is the conduct of the
average prudent man."
' .What Are Safe Places for WorkP
Passing to the third clause, an employer
must provide a suitable place for his em
ployes whhe at work. -Evidently the na
ture Of the place will vary greatly with
the work to be done. A safe place In a
mill means a very different thing from a
safe place In a coal mine. Whether a place
is safe or. not Is a question of fact to be
learned in each particular case.
Adequate Employes.
Two other clauses must be noticed. One
of these requires an employer to use suf
ficient help for the particular task to be
done. This rule Is more frequently ap-
E lied to. railroads than to other concerns,
ometimes.a train is started with too few
hands and' an accident happens. Thus in
Flake, vs. Boston and Albany Railroad
Company a train was sent out with only
two brakemen . Instead of the ordinary
number, three. . An Injury happened to
one of the men and he sued the company
claiming that It waa neglectful In sendinjr
the train out with less than the usual
number. The court slid that "It was
dearly s the duty of the corporation In
making, up and dispatching the advance
train to supply it with suitable machinery
.and sufficient help lor the business ajaa
journey which It was about to undertake,
and if there was any want of care In theso
respects which caused the injury, it Is lia
ble. â¢ â¢ â¢ The hiring of a third brake
man was only one of the steps proper to
be taken to discharge the principal's duty,
which was- to supply with sufficient help
and machinery' and properly cispatch the
train in question, and this duty remained
to be performed, although the hired
brakeman failed to wake up In time or
was sick or failed to appear for any other
reason. It was negligent for the company
to start the train without sufficient help."
The company therefore was held liable to
the injured employe.
Instructions to Employes.
Lastly, it Is the duty of tho employer to
give instructions. Tnese are of various
kinds. Some relate to the conduct of all
the employes, others are for the special
guidance of minors. A railroad company
nas many rules which must be known to
it3 employes and in many cases it has
been held neglectful In not making them
known. These will be fully considered
hereafter. ,
Such Is the great rule that governs em
ployers in hiring their employes. Had it
always been enforced the rights and du
ties of employed and employes would have
been much simpler and better understood.
It has, however, been greatly modified, as
we shall hereafter see, until but very lit
tle of it remains. Before stating in what
ways this has been done some other topics
must first be considered.
Bisks Assumed by Temporary Em
ployes. â¢
Before leaving the subject of the risk
assumed by an employe, another class of
cases ought to be mentioned, those in
which persons are temporarily employed
in some other way not included In the
original contract of hiring. Often they are
of a more dangerous character than those
first undertaken. Yet it has been held
that if they are undertaken knowingly
the- risk is assumed, as In other cases,
and there can be no recovery for an in-
Jury received while executing them.
Even though the employe receives no
greater reward for assuming the larger
risk, he can get nothing If injured. It
Is said that he assumes the- risk rather
than lose his place. In Leary vs. the
Boston and. Albany Railroad Company
the question was fully considered. The
person injured was aiding as fireman on
an engine and knew that this duty waa
not within his original contract as a la
borer. He chose to perform It rather
than lose his position as a laborer. In
so doing the court said that he assumed
the risk. The remarks of the court are
worth giving. After declaring that he
did this rather than lose his place. the>
court continued: "By so doing he en
grafted this duty on his original contract,
of which he made it a part. Morally
to coerce a servant to an employment,
the risk of which he does not wl3h to en
counter, by threatening otherwise to de
prive him of an employment he can read
ily and safely perform, may sometimes be
harsh, but when one has assumed an em
ployment, if an additional and more dan
gerous duty Is added to his original labor,
he may accept or refuse it If he does
accept it then he also assumes the risks
that are incidental thereto. The em
ployer." so the court continues. "Is not
necessarily unjust because he wishes in
his employ a servant who can from time
to time relieve a skilled workman, while
his ordinary duties will be those of a
mere laborer. It must certainly be his
right to engage a servant who. while hia
ordinary duties will be simple and ex
pose him to no danger, is willing as a
part of his service from time to time to
assume duties which, in order to be safelv
performed, require a higher degree of
skill and which exposÂ© him to a certain
degree of danger."
This, however. Is not the law In everv
S^te. The rule Is Indeed a harsh one.
A laborer Is requested to act as fireman
and assume the greater risk. The court
says that If he does not wtsh to act he
need not: then he fears that If he does
not .Â£? V n Iose nts pIace - Rather than
do t his he accepts, performs the larger
service, though receiving no greater re
ward. In other words, his employer hlrea
him for one service and uses him for an
other. He may Indeed decline, but fears

here for Fish Rock and on arriving there
could not make port. She anchored out
side, and a northwester coming up shÂ«
parted both anchors and went on the
rocks. Luckily she drifted off. and sail be
ing made she got off shore and came back
to San Francisco. Her cargo was taken
off in a hurry yesterday and she will go
on the drydock.
Arcata in Distress.
,"It was impossible to lower a boat and
I prepared to stand by. Just about this
time the United States steamer Albatross
hove in sight and bore down on us. I sig
naled the captain what the matter was
and he at once agreed to stand by the A.
J. "West and supply her with all necessary
provisions as soon as the sea went down,'
so I stood on my course again, having
nearly 500 passengers aboard."
The A. J. West Is owned by the Slade
Lumber Company and Is to load a cargo
of timber at Grays Harbor for Manila.
When spoken it was blowing a south
easter, and the steamer "Walla Walla and
the Fish Commissioners' steamer Alba
tross could not send assistance. For sever
al hours the three vessels lay within speak
ing distance almost, the schooner with her
ensign union down, the only sail set being
a portion of the foresail, while in the rig
ging was a big board on which was paint
ed, "Out of flour; short of provisions."
Captain A. Hall of the Walla Walla in
speaking of the West's predicament yes
terday said: "It was blowing strong from
the southeast and there was a very heavy
sea. Early on October 27 the lookout re
ported a schooner on the starboard bow
with its flag union down. I at once headed
for her, and when within hailing distance
found that she was the" A. J. West, forty
seven days out from Santa Rosalia for
Grays Harbor. She appeared to have had
a hard time of it, and when a big board
was put in the rigging I edged the Walla
Walla up In order to read it. On it was
painted, 'Out of flour and short of pro
visions.'
when spoken off Destruction Isl
and on October 27, in latitude 47 13 norm,
she was In distress. The crew was living
on beans and an occasional goonie that
was unwary enough to bite at a red rag
attached to a fish hook. .:. Â¦:.
THE schooner A. J. West has been
having a hard time of it. She Ms
now fifty-one days out from Santa
Rosalia for Grays Harbor, and
She Is Long Overdue From Santa Rosalia at Grays Harbor,
- and When Last Heard Prom the Albatross
Was Standing By.

Defining bad government and its results leads

your school houses enlarged; your pleasures

The location of the State prison at San
Quentin, within the confines of Mann
County, often entails upon that county
the expense of trying many of the State
prisoners who violate the rules and com
mit crimes beyond the Jurisdiction of the
prison authorities to punish. These are
all tried at San Rafael; the county Is
taxed for the expense, which belongs to
the State, but in no Instance has Mr. Bel
shaw failed to vote for any bill relmbus-
Ing the taxpayers of that county for this
outlay unwittingly forced upon -them.
Belshaw's course throughout his entire
legislative career has been one of con
sistency. When a measure of any practi
cal good came up before him for consider
ation his vote was always recorded on the
right side. In the Interest of the people,
but when there was the least taint of
suspicion surrounding any measure, oppo

When Porter Ashe was escorted to the
stage he was received with deafening ap
plause. He commenced his speech by
drawing his listeners' attention to the fact
that this was a workingman's district, and
that they should take as much interest in
the election as the capitalists. He scored
the army transport service, laying espe
cial stress on the Hancock case, which,
the speaker said, was a true sample of
the abuse which has developed. He also
referred to the Jirilus Kahn Business

posed of rich men.

CALLING TO THE STAND FIRM
THE SAN FKANUISUO CAXJl^ WEDNESDAY, OCTOJBKK 31, lWlK '/
POLITICAL â¢ opponents of Hoii.
Charles. M. Belshaw, the Republl
"can nominee for State Senator in
the district composed of Marin
and Contra Costa counties, are en
deavoring to make capital out of his vote
on Senate bill No. iÂ£, "an act to prevent
deception in the manufacture of butter
and cheese, to secure its enforcement and
to appropriate money therefor."
Just about the time this bill was intro
duced into the Legislature all kinds of
commissions were being formed for thÂ«
alleged purpose of investigating all kinds
of interests, ostensibly, but really to pro
vide soft snaps for political hirelings ami
to saddle upon the taxpayers of the State,
additional burdens. This bill was one of
this kind, which, under the guise of a
great good to a thriving industry, was so
clothed in verbiage that its real purpose
was concealed and it took a mind of more
than ordinary perception to discover its
real purpose. Â»
At that time the State ' maintained in
an office on- Davis street a commissioner,
supposed to be a dairy expert, whose chief
business it was once. a year to gather to
gether representatives of the dairy inter- I
ests in the State. This meeting was usu
ally-held in September. . when the grass
was dry, and learned papers were read by
university professors, experts of the ani
mal industry department of the United
Slates Government, and dairymen with all
Kinds of experiences. i
These dlpqulstlons, ranging from "How
to Milk a Cow with One Hand," to the
theories of "Lacteal Producing Substances
In Hay and Alfalfa," were collated in a
brochure issued from the State printinK
office, and were scattered broadcast
throughout the State, even to the outer
most confines of the Mojave Desert and
Death Valley, where milk la obtained
when possible from a can of the con
densed kind.
But the dairy interest was a vast one
and politicians' eyes turned longingly
from the cow to .the treasury, which af
forded, an opportunity to obtain a brand
of golden cream which the ordinary
bovine would not yield. So it was pro
posed to organize a commission, pay fancy
salaries, give employment to a number
of inspectors, clerks and other attaches,
and appropriate large sums of money for
the maintenance of the bureau or com
mission. The bill was apparently all right
on its face, but it carried a nice' little
Joker.
All kinds of commissions were thus
being created, and if a check had not been
put on them every politician out of a job
would have .been enabled to get on, and
under the pretense of protecting the baby,
the cow and the cheese eater, have waxed
fat at the expense of the taxpayer. The
bill was not intended for the protection
of the dairy interests, bo much as it was
intended to provide places for political
parasites. Â¦
So when the bill came up for passage
in the Assembly Mr. -Belshaw .voted
against the measure, - prefacing his vote
by the following statement:*
"I vote no on Senate bill No. 8S, because
I think it is unwise to establish a com
mission to give special protection to any
particular kind of Industry at the expense
of the Slate at large. I would have voted
for the bill if the section creating the
commission and making the appropriation
for the same had been stricken out.""
Notwithstanding Belshaw's strong oppo
sition, based on the highest regard for
the interests of the State at large, the bill
passed 'the Senate by a vote of 32 ayes,
no noes being recorded, and by the As
sembly by 52 ayes and 12 noes.
It is upon thl? slender basis that the op
ponents of Mr. Belshaw are claiming that
he is opposed to the- dairying interests 'of
the State. Yet his keen foresight into the
possible doings of a commission of the
scope of this shows that he stood more
in favor of the dairying interests by his
opposition to the bill than did those who
voted for the measure. His friends are
asking "What has the Dairy Commission
ever done for the dairy interests?"
In contrast, however, with his opposition
to the bill creating a useless commission
is his vote on the bills introduced in 1837.
entitled an act defining the different
grades of cheese, and standing for same
(Assembly Journal, page 85); and an act
entitled "to provide for the Inspection of
dairies, etc.. and making an appropriation
therefor" (Assembly journal, page 1320),
on which he voted in favor of the bills.-
Again in the session of 1899, his redord
is shown by the Journal of the Assembly,
page 971, when Senate bill No. 59, "an act
providing for the inspection of dairies"
was under consideration. And again
when Senate bill No. 732, "an act to pro
vide for the Inspection of dairies and ap
propriating money therefor," was under
consideration, his vote and remarks â¢ are
recorded on page 1543 of the Assembly
Journal. These official records are likely
to furnish the petard which will hoist the
men who lighted it.
Marin County, too, ought to be grateful
to Mr. Belshaw, for he has been a persis
tent and earnest champion of h>r legiti
mate claims against the State Treasury.

A notable recital was that given last
evening by Mrs, Oscar Mansfeldt, pianist,
at Sherman-Clay Hall. The programme,
exceptionally interesting from a- pianlstlc
standpoint. Included also a new . trio ] for
piano, violin, and 'cello, composed.by : a
youthful pupil of Hugo Mansfeldt, Albert
I. Elkus. Master Elkus numbers yet but
15 years and has certainly achieved a re
markable musical success with his- In
teresting trio. There are three movements.
Allegro. Andante and Allegro Vivace, and
the composition shows unmistakable
faculty. it was very well rendered by
Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt, Samuel Savannah
and Louis Von der Mehden and was:en
thusiastically received by the audience.
Mrs. Manefeldt Included, in a worthy and
difficult programme of piano solos, the
Schumann Carnaval," finely given; a
charming Balnt-Saens "Mazurka;"- Â¦ the
A flat "Walu," B minor "Scherzo," A
minor. "Etude. A flat "Prelude" and the
big A flat "Polonaise." all of Chopin. The
latter number, with Its transcendentally
difficult octave passages for the left hand,
was splendidly rendered.

principal. A. A. Macurda. are rapidly
raising the standard of the work done in
that institution. Their purpose Is to put
it In the front rank of the technical
schools of the country. After the Christ
mas holidays a new class will be admit
ted, the course for that class extending
for three years and a half, while subse
quent classes will enter a four-year regu
lar course in place of the Â»*-Â»ree years
hitherto offered.
Another change In the schedule will be
one which allows great freedom of choice
1 In the third and fourth years, enabling
students to pursue np.'cial branches and
obtain greater proficiency !n them than
would be obtained by pursuing a regular
prescribed course. Â¦ .
The department of wood carving will be
put in operation shortly after Christmas
under the charge of Mr. Kemp. A new
commercial class will be formed, limited
to fifteen members, as that department is
already well filled. All the Bhops have
undergone renovation and . improvement
with an addition of equipment. A new
kitchen has been fitted up for the domes

aro seeking to shorten the hours of their

from as many points of view, and placed

aspect.

The first speaker. J. X. Tocng. was In
troduced by Mr. Webster. He spoke in
part as follows: -

An Â¦unusually large and enthusiastic au
dience filled Odd Fellows' Hail last night

JL4rair.st the proposed crdlr.ar.ee to license

tention ua.Â« ra^d to the several speeches
of the various speakers, who comprised
rr.ar.y cf the city's best-kr.own bun'ness
men and divines. One of the moat fa Â«. tr
ebly received addresses of the evening
was that cf the Rev. "William Rader.
whoso forceful and eloquent periods
gained for him much applause. Speeches
were also made by J. X. Young, who
placed the question before the audience in
its legal aspect, C. A. Murdock, the Rev.
Dr. Clasipett. the Rev. J. A. B. Wilson
and J. M. Reynolds.
I am reminded of the itory of the frog who
having fallen Into a can of milk kicked so vig
orously in his efforts to escape that he churned
the contents of the can into butter and so
gained a footing and jumped to freedom. I
propose that we kick the mlU of public senti
ment until we have converted It Into good yel
low butter and we come out sitting tired but
triumphant on top.
This poolroom evil Is in the municipal blood.
We must cure It with the ballot. Let us once
and for all settle this question and oust from
our society the gambler and his poolroom.
This thing is a question of principle. Who is
to rule San Francisco T The respectable ele
ment, our merchants, our good citizens, or the
poolsellers, the saloon element?
How many times during the last year has my
bell rung for men and women who have been
cast out of thece hells, wrecks â mind ami
money gone. How many times for young men,
sons of lo% # ing mothers, who have prayed me to
send word to their parents of their dire ftraits.
The Chief of Police was recently summoned
before a court of law for enforcing a city stat
ute agalnet gaming. Shame on San Francisco
for such an action and all honor t? the Police
Department for the work It has done In sup
preselng this Iniquitous industry.
The ballot is crystallized pubtlc opinion. Tou
may hear a great deal about California's laxity
of principle and virtue Is Easternly supposed
to vanish with the crossing of the Rockies,
but it seems to me if we dig down deep enough
under our sand dunes we will strike Plymouth
Rock. We have a Etate conscience, a munici
pal conscience, a public conscience, which when
rou6ed speaks with a voice of thunder. But
next Tuesday we must do more than thunder.
IVe must act promptly" once and for ail and
crush this evil. Â£>very city has its municipal
troubles. Municipal troubles are the world's
troubles.
I arn reminded this evenlnr of a remark made
by Wendell Phillips In one of his orations, that
though the Alpe. high and mighty, were sym
bols of a great monarchy, the great ocean,
pure almost as ether, was the symbol of a
mighty democracy always active. And so to
night I want to. remind you that to be mighty
a democracy must be active.
between us and the 6th of November let as
rouse to a white heat public Indignation.
The Rev. William Rader epoke In part
as follows:
The Rev. J. A. B. Wilson spoke at
length on the evil which must come out
of the poolroom. He said:
I eubmlt that if ths privilege to carry on
hi* trade Is to be told to the tempter, why
not to the tempted, too? You would grant one
man the right to it and refuse it to thÂ« other.
If we are to have an ordinance to permit pool
sellin* why not have an ordinance to leitaliie
the embezzlements and forgeries Its votaries
are led Into. Let us be active In the few days
that remain. In thÂ« short interval that lies
"I sav as an embassador of God," de
clared the Rev. Dr. Clampett, "that
should this iniquitous ordinance pas3 his
curse will descend on the city. On the
6th of next November go to the polls and
crush this ordinance as you would an
adder."
If tiere be ever an occasion when ancels
rejoice and men are happy It is when
comet out of evil. We are here to-nleht,
tr.ar.y sect*, many iclnfli, but on this one point
we are as one ir.an. To protect the fair name
of our city. Are the people of San Francisco
to show to the world on the 6th of November
that they are wicked or blind T We are not
here to-nleht, however, to discuss that ques
tion, but to express our Indignation, and to
Â£rht for the moral security of our homes. It
Is not enough not to vote for this ordinance;
we must vj'-e against It. The section of the
ballot which refers to the ordinance Is In tho
extreme corner. Lock for it carefully, and let
the last thing tfcat you eight do be the first
thlruc that you do do.

dur Supreme Court has pronounced aralnst

a Sut>Â«rlor Court which brlngi our State into
th* front rank of civilization. Now I give these
g-er.t>men notice that their nefarious practices
caa never be carried on In this city, even
thoi^h a municipal ordinance be passed 11
eensizjr such a "thing. We would ' la such an
â¢vÂ»nt be afcle to so to the Supreme Court, and
St would say to the municipality: "Tou can

C. A. Murdock was then Introduced and
spoke briefly and to the point. He said:
At Odd Fellows' Hall Immense Throngs Protest in Indignation
Against the Proposed Pro-Poolroom Ordinance.
NOTED DIVINES CALL ON VOTERS
TO EXTERMINATE GAMBLING EVIL
IT happens In the Legislature that the course of boodle will not always run smooth. Unexpected obstacles occur to
eÂ«eve the grafter and upÂ«et the calculations of the push. A word spoken In Jest may arouse suspicion, and divert
attention to some particular measure. Assemblyman Dibble In his long career at Sacramento has had his Joys and
Borrow*. One of his sorrows came from an incident in the history of Senate bill 87. . The unlucky number "thir
teen" figures In the proceeding, as the bill' was Introduced in the Senate on January 13, 1S91. Here Is the lnnocent
.ooking little measure as It went to the Assembly:
AN ACT RELATING TO THE PUNISHMENT OF FORTUNE TELLING.
Section 1. A new section is hereby added to Chapter Eight of Title Thirteen of Part One of the
Penal Code of the State of California, to be numbered Section five hundred and thirty-eight, to read as
follows: iC'iK Â¦ ?~Â«'^
Section 538. Every person, -who, for a valuable consideration, or for a promise of re-wrard, undertakes
to predict for another the' future, or reveal the past, by means of cards, communications irom the dead, ex
amination of any part of the person dead or living, looking at the stars or heavens or representations there
of, planets or other bodies, heavenly or otherwise, or by any means not natural, or who priijts or causes to
be printed or exhibits any sign or symbol intended to induce others to have their fortunes told or the past
revealed, or thÂ« future predicted, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
The bill was Introduced about the time that a company was organized for the purpose of installing in Saij Fran
clsco nlckel-in-the-slot machines with attachment or device for springing fortune-telling cards. When the representative
cf the machines saw this bill he came to the conclusion that the company which he represented would lose money If
the measure was not defeated. Before going to Sacramento he made Inquiry concerning members of the Legislature. He
was advised to see H. C. Dibble, Assemblyman of the Forty- first District. The agent accepted the advice, went to Sacra
mento and paid his respefcts to the representative of the Forty-first.
The etory of what took place thereafter, If true, tends to prove that bad luck attaches to the figure 13. When the
arent made known his business he wa* Invited by Mr. Dibble to a. seat In the 6eml-clrcular row of easy chairs In rear
cf the places reserved for members of the Assembly. When they Â¦were comfortably seated the agent remarked that the
bill. If enacted Into law, would hurt his business, hence he expressed a desire that the Assembly should kill the bill or
amend It. The Assemblyman, listened attentively. When it came his turn to speak he asked how much the company was
prepared to pay for defeating the obnoxious bill. The suggestion of paying for the legislation astounded the agent, but
it did not cause him to lose his presence of mind. He replied to the Assemblyman of the Forty-first that he was not
prepared to pay any sum, and added that before he could enter into any engagement to pay money to defeat the bill he
must ccnsult with the company which he represented. In order to present the case clearly to the owners of the fortune
telling aachir.es he asked how much money would be required to extinguish the bill. The Assemblyman stated that
four or five hundred dollars would be necessary, but he assured the agent that he did not want the money for himself,
but for others, as he would make no charge for his own efforts to defeat the bill.
Tfce agent tock the) matter ur.der consideration end decided to go to San Francisco and submit the proposition to his
principals. It i> cot related whether he grot a "hunch" from some invisible source or simply surmised that it would bÂ«
proper to tell his troubles to a-n attache of the Legislature that he happened to bump up against on his way cut of the
Capitol building to catch the train, but he spoke. The attache listened and then gave -a shout of surprise: "Did Dib
ble tell you to go ar.d dig up to kill that bill?" The attache then swore out assortments of merry oaths, exclaiming:
"The advertising fellows and newspaper managers were up here last week and killed the bill. It is burled out of
sight and beyond resurrection." The agent investigated and found at once that the attache was telling the straight
truth. No further steps were taken to raise a fvnd to be disbursed by the Assemblyman of the Forty-first.
This story tends to strengthen the popular suspicion that there is something unlucky for somebody in the number
thirteen. It also serves to show that the course of boodle does not always run smooth. In this case an Intrusive and Im
pudent attache neglects his business to interfere with the affairs of a member Just as a shaking down event Is about to
occur.
There ought to be a debating society in the Forty-first Assembly District these long winter evenings for the dlscus
eion cf questions like this: "Is It not more commendable In our representative in the Legislature to take money to kill a
dead bill than to accept a fee to promote the passage of a live one?"
Incidentally, the bright, intelligent young men of the district could In the debate compare the merits of the fortune
telling rseasure with the oil pipe line blU.
Why the Agent for a Fortune-Telling Device Did Not Cross the
Peflm of an Apparently Willing Assembiyman.
DIBBLE SAW HIS CHANCE TO KILL
A "GONER" BILL, BUT DID NOT FILL
FOR PROSPERITY

This late action had a sympathetic move
ment on the whole market and pulled some of
the railroad stocks above last night's level.
There was sotne strength* among the leading
industrials and specialties^ led by sugar, ThÂ»>
Iron and steel. Flocks were Inclined to advance
after some early heaviness In sympathy with
a loss of 14 In tlnplate. Plttsburg. C. C. and
J?t. Louis fell nÂ«arly eight points on light sell
ing and National Lead preferred lost SH,. Â«â¢
The money market was easier on a relaxa
tion In the demand rather than In any addi
tional supply. The heavy collections by the
rubtreasury on account of Internal revenue sre
offset by payments on account of Alaskan gold
and by the expectation of further receipts of
sold imports from Europe. There have been
no transfers of currency to the interior through
the subtrpasury eince last Friday. The foreign
money markets begin to reflect the determined
efforts of the Bank. of England to Influence
the unfavorable exchange against London and
sterling exchange here hardened a shade from
the Fame rauee.
The tendency of bonds was rather Â«*sy, but
points of strength developed in the market as
the day progressed. The total sales were
S1.210.000. United States bonds were unchanged
on the last call.
NEW TOPJC. Oct. SO.â There were only on<s
or two movements of a"ny interest on the Stock
Exchange to-day. The market fell into a rtate
of rerai-Ktagnatlon at times and . moved slug
gishly and Irregularly with no other motive
power than the operations of the professionals
who sought to tr-ake a day's trade. There was
a very marked lack of the orders through com
mission houses, which were a feature last
week. The apathetic aspect of the market wns
not explained by any news of the day. It was
the outcome largely of the conservative spirit
of caution, which is not umTsual in the clos
ing davs of a national campaign. There is
some uneasiness lest the speculation on the
j.art of the outside public has over-discounted
the conditions existed to develop after the elec
tion is out of the way. There has been some
disposition on the part of the commission brok
en? Ao call for an extension of margins. The
risk Incident to the particular period is alleged
&Â£ the ground, but It is thought not Improbable
that enforcement of conservative views on
speculation may be an ulterior motive of the
C'immiEsitn houses. This morning's market
ehowed some remaining effect from thÂ« rally
ing tendency of yesterday. But the buying ex
hibited itself soon after the opening and prices
drifted to a inm r level. The. poor showing of
net â¢earnings toe September by Northern Pacific
caused the wrUon in that stock from yester
day's strength on the market of isomÂ« very
large blocks. Late in the day Southern Pacific,
alter holding firmly all through the early deal
ings, ehot up 2H on concentrated and very
heavy buying. The stock was bought early for
the London account, seemingly on satisfaction
over the choice of the new executive. An al
moct endless stream of stock was poured out
when the price reached 38, but all offerings
were confidently absorbed. and the price finally
rose through that figure, but the buying was

CHICAOD. Oct. SO.â Wheat started easy, De
cember U&Uc to He lower at 73v;o to 73c. be
cause Liverpool showed only. a disappointing
response to the lc advance here yesterday. This
attitude on the part of the Britons aroused ap
prehension, together with the receipt of In
formation authentically contradicting the Ar
gentine news which influenced the local market
yesterday. On the other hand there was wet
weather and an official crop estimate, making
the Russlon Mxwpects for a wheat crop 4S.000,
000 bushels less than last year. This news
was of sufficient weight to cause a ready de
mand for the offerings at the opening and r>e
cember rallied sharply to 73V4@73%c On profit
taking a decline to 73Hc followed this bulge,
but later confirmatory reports, one of them
credited to Broomhall, were received and an
other rally took place, December climbing to
73 r *c. at which the market closed H@Uc over
yesterday.
Corn was dull but firm. December closed un
changed at 34*ic Local selling was against
the price in oats, although the news was bull

"The weather has continued warm and pleas

and Fome cloudiness. Light rain fell In nearly
all sections north of the Tehmchapl Saturday

were too light to cause damage except to ten

"In all sections where the precipitation has

and profitable the work of plowing and seeding
progressed rapidly, farmers taking advantage
of the iavoraile conditions to prepare for an
unusually large acreage of grain. Sl|puld these
Tavorabie conditions continue. It Is probable
lhat the acreage sown to wheat, barley and
cats will be greatly in excess of last season's.
Karly sown grain is up and looking vigorous
in many places. Green feed is making splen
did growth in the central and northern por

Harrison's circular lays: "Slnca the Moan*
sailed there have been the following Australian
coal deliveries, viz.: -Charles Gounor. 3031 tons:
James Kerr, 3645 tons; Crocodile. 3800 ton*; Oa
borne, 4717 tons; Amlral Troude. 2610 tons; Star
of France, 2377 tons; Fannie Kerr. 3545 tons;
Springbank. 3860 tons; Shenandoah. 4000 tons;
total. 31,685 tons. The quantity at hand this
month Is treble the amount received from Aus
tralia In September. It was all delivered direct
to consumers; anone went Into yard. There are
thirty coal engagements from Sydney and New
castle, aggregating a capacity of about 92,000
tons. A third of this will not arrive here this
year. This shows a shrinkage of about 20,000
tons since the last steamer left. The delay In
loading Is the principal Teaaon why more ton
nage is not diveited in this direction, aa there
cannot be a more profitable port for shipowners
than this, with 20 shillings for coal Inward
and 42 shillings 6 pence for grain outward. Re-

The recent rumors regarding Prunes may be
sifted down to this: Prices will not be any
lewer; the few outside Prunes are generally
held by strong hands, who want to get even
mere than the association prices for them;
about one-fourth of the crop has already been
moved, and what Is more, has passed into con
sumption; and finally, the association does not
expect that any will be carried over Into next
season. There Is no speculation and every
thing sold Is at once consumed.

ear and got down to see : what was the
matter. As Fender stepped in f ron^ of
the car there came the cry:
'iPolly wants a full dinner p-a-1-1," and
there on the headlight was perched h
green parrot. How the bird got there
Fender did not know, but he. took the par
rot into the car with' him and continued
his trip toward Elmhurst. Polly was
very sociable and very talkative and told
the passengers in the car Just exactly
what It thought about the political situa
tion.
"Vote for Mac and prosperity," advised
the Â©bird. "Hurrah for Teddy! Three
cheers for Mac! "Polly don't want a
cracker. Polly wants a full dinner pall."
The advice was kept up during the en
tire, trip to Elmhurst and the bird had
the center of the car. Even those of
the opposite political faith laughed at the
parrot and Slotorman Fender says that
Polly converted him from Bryanlsm.
"If even the birds are for McKinley, I
guess it is time for the rest of us to get
aboard," said Fender.
* It was found that the bird belonged to
John D. Isaacs, who lives on Alice street,
near Thirteenth, the point where the bird
boarded the Hay wards car. Polly got
away from Its home and started on a Tit
tle campaign tour of Its own In the Interest
of McKinley and Roosevelt. < Its first
and most effective campaigning was done
on the Hay wards car. .The railroad men
derived lots of amusement from the bird's
talk and when It was taken away the last
words it said were:
"Good-by, boys. Hurrah for Mac and
Teddy! Gimme a full dinner pail."
POLITICAL PARROT LOADS ITSELF WITH THE BATTLE CRIES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND GOES
FORTH TO DEMONSTRATE THAT EVEN THE BIRDS ARE FOR McKINLEY AND THE PRINCIPLES
THAT THE GREAT LEADER REPRESENTS. â¢ .

Jennie Berriadic. a pretiy French girl,

and detected the fumes of gas when she
arose at 7 o'clock in the morning. Medi
cal aid was summoned, but the body was
cold when the doctor arrived and life had
been extinct for several hours. The key
of the gas burner was In good order and
Miss - Bernadic had been occupying tho
room for six months, so that the theory
of accident is not tenable unless it be ad
sumed that the girl left the gas burning
and that It was extinguished by water or
air in the pipes or other similar cause.
She was represented to be of a very
cheerful disposition and- the Coroners
deputies who were detailed to investigate
the matter were unable to learn whether
the girl had possessed any reaaon for
committing suicide. The autopsy, by
Morgue Surgeon Leland showed that there
was no physical reason for despondency
or unhappiness. . .

husband, -at 296 O'Farrell street.
The key of the gas burner was turned
on and a book lay open In the bed by the
side of the dead man.
Leland retired at 11 o'clock on Monday
night and evidently followed his usual
habit of reading in bed. He probably feil
asleep while reading and the- gas Jet was
extinguished accidentally. That is the
theory, of his relatives, who say that It
is not a case of suicide, there being, so
far as they are aware, an entire absence
of motive.

j The romantic elopement from Sacra
mento of Ethel David and Charles Flor
ence, who fled from the capital on a tan
dem bicycle a few days ago, has had all
of the flavor knocked out of it by a hard
headed peace officer at Hay wards. Flor
ence landed in the town Jail this morning
after -a tearful separation from his. adored
Ethel, while the young woman went Into
retirement- as soon as the prosaic Inter
ference of the authorities had closed the
chapter. Â¦â¢â¢â¢Â¦â¢ â¢_ . .
To add to the difficulties which beset
the path of this modern young Lochlnvar
his. mother, stern of visage and grim with
determination, arrived at the town jail
at Hay wards this afternoon to communi
cate with the youthful Don Juan who had
so far forgotten the proprieties.
There was a scene with woman's tears
mingled with various expressions of con
trition. No one was willing to make any
complaint against young Florence, so to
night he gained his freedom upon promise
that he would not again seek the young
woman who- had been his companion ."In
the rapid night for love and romance.
Miss David is a couple of years the Ju
nior of her daring sweetheart. They were
neighbors at Sacramento and from there
they fled to Stockton. Intending, they de
clared, to get married. But Florence was
not of legal age. Nothing daunted by the
failure to convince the officials In the
Slough City, Florence and his bride-pros
pective continued their journey toward
Oakland. ..*...., -
Relatives were on their trail and the
country hereabout was flooded with Â¦ tele
grams of inquiry for the runaway . pair.
As they were entering Hay wards Town
Marshal Ramage captured the elopers.
With a due regard for the young woman's
feelings Ramage sent her to friends, while
Florence was detained in the town keep.
Mrs. Florence arrived later in response
to summons. She was delegated to make
such a settlement as her Judgment dic
tated. The result was the parting of the
elopers. Florence . headed west for San
Francisco. Miss David says she will re
main at Hay wards until the storm has
blown over. Â¦ â¢

Terror was spread among the .passen
gers on the Oregon express train as il \
neared Sixteenth-street station to-day by
the violent actions of a young colored
p.an who boarded the train at Sulsun.
Th<2 man remained quiet for awhile after
getting on board, but grew res tlss aa the
time passed and soon got beyond con
trol. He rushed through the cars warn
ing the passengers to beware of train rob
bers. When it was seen that the ma,n was
likely to do somebody bodily harm the
trainmen grabbed him and held him in
restraint until the train pulled Into Oak
laud, where he was turned over to the
police and taken to the Receiving Hos
pital. .
"Train robbers, train robbers! Make
youi selves scarce!" was the cry of the
man as lie went from car to car on the
express train. To several passengers of
whom the man made confidants he told
of a conversation overheard In S.uisun of
men who had planned to hold up the
Oregon express. His story was , so
graphic that many of the passengers
thought there must be some foundation
for It and proceeded to hide their valu
ables under the seats and in obscure
i places. The women were badly fright
ened and waited in momentary expecta
tion of being confronted by masked rob
bers.
After awhile it was seen that the man
most to be feared was the colored man
who was spreading the alarm. - He grew
more demonstrative with each passing
moment. At last the trainmen decided to
take a hand. When they approached the
man he urew away from them and yelled
that they were the robbers. The trainmen
were only able to capture the man alter
resorting to craft. It was only after a
desperate struggle that he . was se
cured, as he fought. with the strength of
a maniac. -He was tied to one of the car
seats with ropes, both his hands and feet
being secured. A sigh of relief was
breathed by the terror-stricken passen
gers when Oakland was neared- and the
insane man was taken in charge by Po
lice Officer Kcanlan. On the way to the
Receiving Hospital the negro fought like
a tiger, and it was all three assistants
could do to hold him. ..
At the hospital the man talked ration
ally enough with the exception that he
had train robbers on the brain, of whom
he constantly talked. From papers in
his pockets it was Â¦earned that- the ne
gro's name Is Joseph W. Hays. He said
that he served three years In the Twenty
fourth Infantry of colored troops and
three years in the navy. He gave 'his
residence as 512 Folsom street, San Fran
cisco. He will be examined to-morrow.

MOUNT PLEASANT,- Pa,, Oct. 30.â
Four Italian miners attempted to. rob Pay
Clerk William Hostler of the Southwest
Connellsville Coke Company while ho
was making his trip to-day between thu
city and Alverton with the payroll of the
Alverton and Tarr Works, amounting to
$4000. >
Mr. Hostler is dead, his companion,
Harry. Burgess, messenger of the com
pany, is wounded; two of the Italians ara
dead, a third Is fatally wounded and
fourth is a prisoner in' the jail.
Hostler and Burgess left this city at 1
o'clock this afternoon with the safe con
taining the money to pay off the men at
the Alverton and Tarr Works. Whtu
they reached the summit of the large hill
Just below which lie* Alverton, a largo
coke- town, -without a second's warning
four Italians fired a volley from their
hiding place and sprang forward, firing
as they advanced. Mr. Hostler, fell, dead,
at the first volley. Young Burgess,
though wounded, was able to return the
robbers' fire with effect and one of tbe
number at the horses' heads fell. dead.
A sedond later Burgess fired his revolver
in the face of another and as the thief
fell his two remaining companions became
terrified and, leaving ihe dead one, &ct
out with the wounded one over the hill
to the south. -
Burgess managed to drive on Into Al
verton with the body* of Mr. Hostler and
the fate, where he gave the alarm. Mount
Pleasant â¢ and vicinity, with | the clerical
force of-, the coke company, turned out d00
strong and soon corralled the two robber*,
who hRd concealed themselves In a field on
theDurstlln farm, a mile from this- town.
A Eummons to surrender was answered
by a volley, in which one of the posse re
ceived a slight wound in the chest. The
outlaws were fortified and made. a fierce
stand until one of the posse succeeded. in
getting to their rear. He shot one through
the head, killing him. ' The other surren
dered . and was brought to the office of
Squire Rhodes and remanded to Jail. Â¦
In the meantime another division of the
posse I overhauled the ' third robber, "who
had received a ghastly wound. The ball,
entering his mouth, penetrated his head
and came out at the back of his neck. Ho
is not expected to recover.

Colonel O'Neil entered the National
Guard as a private In Battery H of the
old Second Artillery August 6, 1S75, and
rope successively to corporal, sergeant,
first sergeant, second lieutenant, first
lieutenant and then captain of the bat
tery August 29, 18S8. Â»He held that posi
tion until December 9. 1835, when he be â¢
came captain of Company M. First In
fantry. In 1898 he went to the front, re
turned as major and then became lieu
tenant colonel of the new First Infantry'.
But changes come with time and so it
was In this case. Colonel Duboce never
had an opportunity to command his regi
ment of National Guardsmen. He nassed
away and not long after that there sprang
up a feeling' of opposition to Lieutenant
Colonel O'Neil. It was apparent that tho
implied compact would not be carried out
aa to the colonelcy. Charles Boxton, who
returned from Manila as lieutenant colo
nel of the volunteer regiment, was sug
gested as possible colonel of the reorgan
ised First. Then came a counting 1 of
noses of those entitled to vote and Th?
Call announced two weeks ago that O'Neil
had twenty votes pledged to him, which
prediction was verlnVJ by last night's,
election.^ â¢Â¦â¢â¢ Â»â¢â¢Â»*
a feeling of sentimentality prevailed, for
at that time Colonel Victor D. Duboco.
who was colonel, was sick unto death. It
was known that Duboco had always ha i
a military ambition and that was to be
the colonel of the. First Infantry Regi
ment of the National Guard of California.
To pratify his ambition Major O'Neil
"drew out" and was content to â¢ be the
lieutenant colonel, it being generally un
derstood that as soon as Colonel Duboce
passed away he would without contest
be chosen colonel.

FLY-CASTEBS AT
BANQUET BOABD
Wielders of the Dainty Fly Feast
Medals Won During Past Sea
son Awarded to Victors. .
Three-score members of the San Fran;
dsco Fly-Casting Club met at the banquet
board In a downtown rotlsserie last night
and discussed the good things of life and
matters pertaining to their favorite pas
time. In the absence of Alex T. Vogel
sang, who was .expected to act as toast
master, the pleasing duty devolved on W.
D. -Mansfield,- president of the organiza
tion.
In presenting the medals won during tne
year to the clever wlelders of the colored
fly Mr. Mansfield delivered an earnest
speech. He Informed the recipients of the
trophies that the winning of a medal
meant a great deal. He said the medal
represented a great deal more than its in
trinsic value: it was a trophy which em
bodied the f ulflllment of every condition of
true eportsmanship. He then said it re
called the competition on the banks of
beautiful Stow Lake and the magnanimity
of fellow members, who werÂ« ever ready
to counsel, assist and advise those who
were striving to perfect themselves in the
aft of fly-casting. He said many other
nice things, and Dr. W. E. Brooks and
Edward Everett, who received trophies,
fittingly responded.
Only three medals were presented by the
club this vear. The winners in the various
classes who had in the past won trophies
were satisfied to take the glory. George
H. Foulks, who won the Smyth medal, for
the greatest Improvement during the year,
was unable to attend because of the news
of the death of his mother. The winners
in the various classes were:
Championship class â Long distance. H.
C. Golcher; accuracy. XV. D. Mansfield;
delicacy, W. D. Mansfield.
First classâ Distance, H. F. Muller; ac
curacy, Edward * Everett; delicacy, H.

TALENT LOSES
AT LATONIA
Ring-goers will wend their way to
Woodward's Pavilion this evening to see
the outcome of the boxing bout3 arranged
by the Columbia Athletic Club. It has
been eo long since the public has seen
a professional contest that there is every
likelihood there will be a large outpour-
Ing of the sporting element.
AI Neill, the local middle-weight, and
Ben Tremble of Los Anceles will battle
twenty rounds for a decision and Henry
Lewis and Charles Thurston will go fif
teen rounds. Toby Irwin and Eddie Toy
will inaugurate the Â».vening*s entertain
ment by fighting ten rounds. Jack Walsh
will referee the bouts.
Ben Tremble, who is to do battle with
Neill, is a brother of Jim Tremble, the
Southern California middle-weight, wha
went down before the heavy punches of
Australian Tim Murphy some months ago.
Tim McGrath, who has the brothers un
der his protecting wing, has the greatest
confidence In the world that Ben will take
Neill's measure.
Neill's opponent Is a likely looking fel
low. He is built on lines similar to his
brother Jim. but is a trifle taller. H-s
measures fcjrty Inches around the ches:
and is strdhg as a young bull. McGrath
took his nan to the Hammam baths yes
terday to weigh him. Tremble balance-i
the bar at the figure named in the arti
cles of agreement and Tim breathed
easier. . .
Tremble donned the ploves with clever
"Spider" Kelly yesterday and those who
saw the set-to sagely wagged their heads
and said the Southern Californian would
do. Tremble has fought draws with "Sol
dier" Phil Green, "mimniy" Rowan. Bob
Thompson and other well-known pugil
ists. Shifty Tommy Tracy gained a de
cision over Tremble In a 17-round bout,
but Brother Jim evened matters.-up by
fighting Tracy a draw. McGratn does not
want to compare the brothers, as he is
managing both. He simply says that Ben
can hit and advises his friends to show
wisdom in their bet tine.
Neill has prepared for the fray at tha
Beach Tavern on the Ocean boulevard.
He is as line as a racehorse and as hard
as nails Is the report that comes from
his training quarters. Neill intends go
ing East and he knows that a defeat will
spoil his contemplated trip. He will fight
hard to win and an exciting contest
should result.
Thurston and Lewis ara in nne fettle
and Toby Irwin Is In the pink of condi
tion and ought to make things lively for
Eddie Toy, his old opponent. The ad
vance sale of tickets ia large and a good
attendance is assured.
ThÂ© Golden Gate Athletic Club will hold
Its next monthly fistic exhibition In
Washington Square Hall on Friday even
ing. The following well-known amateur)
will appear: Joe Sullivan and Mike Ford,

Dr. Magnus and Miss Ball Will Have
to Fight for Their Salaries
Because of a Tech- .

The trouble over the certificate of Miss
â¢Catherine Ball is likely to end in a sujt
o determine the legal standing of the
Board of Education. As it stands now
;he board has renewed her certificate
*-lthout the consent or recommendation
it tl:c Beard of Examiners and the Su

â¢ant for November. She will have to sue
>ut a writ of mandamus to \x>mpel him
;o do fo and he will contend that the
3oaid of .Education has not the power to
esue or renew certincates without the
Â»onÂ«tnt or co-o*>tTation of the Supenn
"eadfsit. The c-narter says the Doard

â¢a.tÂ«-**anu the State constitution say? cer
iiflcates shall be issued by the county
Â»oaras and county superintendents. It Is
tard to &ay what they all mean.
"There is" not one of the superintendents
jf cho State, besides Mr. NV ebster,' saiu
Mr Mark, president of the Board of
Education, yesterday, "who has taken
luch a technical position in regard to tn*
taw. lie claim.* that special as well as
regular teachers shall have such crefien
lals as are allowed by the State Board or
Examination, and the State Board of tx
imination has named certain institutions
â¢kjiich it considers equal in educational
rank to :he standard of -the State Lnl
.ersity.- in the State University there U
no course of music, yet the Superlntend
fcnt would accept as a special teacher of
music a. graduate of the university when
he wouJa turn aside one who had been
;rair.ed in the best musical cclJepes of Lu
rope. for the State Board of Examination
tu>Â£ not mentioned musical colleges as up
to the standard of the State University.
The contention of the board is that the
law in regrard â¢ to special teachers ir>
framed with a view to secure the beÂ«t
specialist? obtainable, no matter where
they were educated, and the credentials
presented by the State board are forgen
eral purpose?, not special branches."
Miss Ball was educated in the Cooper
Tnion of New York. According to Mr.
Mark she is a woman with almost a na
tional reputation as a teacher of draw-
Ing. She has had a better education than
is afforded even at present by the State
University. In the same category as
her certificate is that issued to Dr. Max
Magnus, except that in her case it is a re
newal and in his it is an original issue.
I>r. Magnus has be>en trained In physical
culture in the best schools of the coun
try and he has diplomas from each. In
either the course In physical culture is so
far ahead of the gymnastics in the State
I'niversity that they cannot be compared,
yet because he has not been educated in
those Institutions named by the State
Board of Examination, the Superintend
ent will not admit that he can receive a.
certificate. In the case of Dr. Mapnus.
Mr. Mark says the Superintendent has
offered to sign his warrant as an employe,
but not as a teacher, but the board will
not issue a warrant to him as an em
ploye. No such concession has been made
In the case of Miss Ball.
With these conditions In view the board
decided that the credentials upon which
Miss Ball secured her certificate were suf
ficient, and so they renewed it. In the.
case of Dr. Magnus the same course was
taken.
. Tho Superintendent points to the law
and declares that it plainly requires that
credentials in earh case shall be the
Fame. To renew such a certificate woulrl
be to perpetuate an evil, and so the Boaril
of Examiners ha* refused to recommend
It. The rertiedy he say?, lies in examina
tion, but teacher** are not willing- to pass
an examination after years of satisfactory
Fervioe in the department, or while hold-
Ing diplomas from the best colleges of
their particular specialties. The suit
may end fn the rtissolutlon of the City-
Board of Examiners, but the members sav
they do not care, for it will relieve them
of a crrat deal of extra work. The prin
cipal contention is. therefore, how far the
board is independent of the Superintend
ent r-.f Schools.
Miss Ball will have to find that out.

-Proctor came to the Palace on October
2, registering from New York. He claimed
that he was a company promoter, and
that he received such a large salary that
the hardest work he had was to cremate
his coin. His wardrobe was not very ex
tensive. In fact .when he left the hotel
last Saturday he carried off nearly all his
wearing apparel on his back, with the ex
ception of a pair of old snoes which he
left for the hotel management as a sou
venir of his visit.
Proctor is a. very much sought after
man. and the hotel clerks are repeatedly
questioned by anxious visitors as to
whether or not the great mining mag
nate has resumed quarters at the hotel.

some business dealings with him ana that
they were. to have met on Saturday by
appointment to close the transaction. Ho
was very Indignant and claimed that he
had 'been "done up." Proctor waa out
here iast year in the Interests of a large

Miss Zane Sues to Becover on Note
and an Astonishing Bill for
Gowns and Garments Is
Produced in Defense.
Society has produced a lawsuit, with
Miss Marie Zane as plaintift and Mrs.
Lillie 11. de Onativia as defendant, that
will keep the ladies gossiping until next
Lent On the one side, that of the fair
plaintiff, is a $3)0 note which she seeks
to collect; on the other there is everything
in acounter claimâ a bill in equity, as it
wcre-from a blue foulard gown with
white dots, trimmed with cherry ribbons
and white chiffon, to a blue silk corset.
This corset and "Cito." Mrs. de Onativia s
husband, flit in and out among the wind-
Ings of the fabric of this quarrel between
once Hrm friends, and It is hard to defi
nitely locate them, save that the corset
was bought at Paris for tÂ» francs and
"Cito". became a benedict at Cairo in dis
tant. Egypt. â¢
Miss zane's suit was called for hearing
by Judge Sea well yesterday. As both
piaintm and detendant arc absentâ Miss
iane now resiuing ot 1 East Seventy
lourth street, New lork, and Mrs. ae
Onativia being with her husband at 83
Avenue du liols de Boulogne, Palis,
*Tauceâ the cast; is oeing largely trieu by
deposition. The reading of plaintiff's dep
osition opened the proceedings. Tne in
terrogatories were lead by one attorney
and tne answers by another, and tnus the
usual wearisome reading of such papers
was largely done avyay with. In her dep
osition-Miss Zane says:
"In 1S% 1 was residing with my uncle,
Mr. Alexander Loughuoroug-h, in Ban
Kranclsco. he was paying my expenses :
and otherwise caring tor me. In May of
that year 1 received a note from the de
lendant, who was then Mrs. Henry At
water Jerome. She asked me to visit her
at Coronado, which 1 did. She paid my
expenses, and after visiting there for a
while we visited the Hotel del Monte and
other places. Mrs. de Onativia then sug
gested to me to take a trip with her to
Kurope. Â¦â¢ She said she Intended taking
Laura McKinstry with her, but as 1 was
such a f good friend of hers she would
dearly love to show t^z all the places in
the old country she was acquainted with.
She said she was beset with creditors and
Â¦wanted to get away from California as
quickly as possible.
"After Mr. Loughborough'B death she
again urged me to take the trip with her.
1 was agreeable, and then she asked me
to loan her $3500, which I had in the bank.
With this J3500 she said she could pay the
most persistent of her creditors and could
be a tree woman once again. She would
give me a note, make out a will in my
iavor and insure her life for me for the
$3500. 1 consented, drew the money out
of the bank and gave it to her. Shortly
afterward we started for Europe. I was
her guest and she paid all my expenses,
and it was never understood that I was
to pay my share. She, through .necessity,
was forced to have a companion, and my
companionship cost her nothing, save my
expenses. Â¦ â¢
."â¢We started on our trip, and In July of
1837 we were in Houlgate, In Normandy.
Thence we visited Vienna, and from there
I visited my cousin. Baroness von Pien
czykowska, at Iglau. Austria. From
there we went to Vienna, Dresden, Buda
pest, Trieste, Bologna, Rome, Naples,
Brlndlsl, Athens, Constantinople, Cairo,
Alexandria, Malta; Algiers. Marseilles and
Paris and London. 1 carried no trunk,
my clothing being with those of my host
ess, together with the silverware, eccen
tric parasol handles and a collection of
fans. I never borrowed money from Mrs.
de Onativia, but she frequently borrowed
from me.
"During our travels my hostess met her
present husband, T. L.. de Onativia. He
accompanied us on our travels, and at
Cairo their marriage was solemnized.
Then we went back to Paris and London.
l_Â»ater I came home, as I will tell later."
Here Mrs. de Onativia's deposition right
fully breaks into the case. She alleges
that she did not offer to take Miss Zane
with, her as guest, but It was mutually
! understood that Miss Zane was to pay her
own expenses. The $3500 was offered her,
she says, in order that the trip to Europe
could be undertaken the quicker. Mrs. de
Onativia says she was offered the use of
Madrona villa by Mrs. Darltng If she
chose to remain In California until . her
affairs could be straightened out. but she
had secured her divorce from Mr. Jerome
and wished to forget, old scenes, so she
accepted the $3500 and the start was made.
As an additional offset Mrs. de Onativia
says she gave Miss Zane clothingâ many
gowns and six chemisesâ paid for her bi
cycle hire, purchased the blue foulard,
another light blue foulard, a gray cloth
dre,s8 trimmed with guipure, the blue cor
set, a bicycle suit, underclothing, and, last
of all, she claims Miss Zane. took a nickel
plated -bicycle worth $150, which she
owned, without her consent. Altogether
Mrs.' de Onativia' says Miss Zane cost her
J4500, which is more than an offset to the
note In question.
Miss Zane again takes the stand. She
admits taking some dresses from Mrs. de
Onativia. but says Mrs. de Onativia gave
the dresses to her in exchange for others.
The . six chemises Miss Zane. says ; were
given to her by her hostess because they
did not fit her hostess, and she didn't want
to throw, them. away. . Two, bicycle suits,
the plaintiff continues, were made at Mrs.
de Onatlvia'a request in: New York, one
for' each of them, but when Mrs. de Ona
tavla i saw them she took that made for
the plaintiff "because it hung better," and
left that with a "bad hang" for her guest,
the plaintiff. So the story goes all through
the depositions. Prices of clothing, who
was bettered by an exchange of clothing,
how much bicycles cost; how much meals
are In Budapest, whether or not Miss Zane
was forced -to sleep on a lounge In her
hostess' stateroom and whether, or not it
was a fact that their quarrel wa? the re
sult of ; an Â¦ objection of Miss Zane's New
York 1 aunt, Mrs. E. : I. Keys, to divorced,
.women, 'are all involved in the contro
versy.
" Letters, some pleasant, others girlishly
sarcastic and ; spiteful, in which De Ona
tivia Is forced often . to bear the name
"Cito," are among the pleadings and pa
pers.. -; With these, assisted by elaborate
briefs to be prepared by counsel , i Judge
Seawell will endeavor to render a just de
cision on Â¦ th.e ' distressing . Issues Involved.
