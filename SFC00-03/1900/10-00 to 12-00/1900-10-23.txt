LAMP EXPLODES AND AGED
WOMAN BURNS TO DEATH
Laura Lambert Becomes* the Subject of a Daring Surgical
Operationâ Heroism of Her Sweetheart and
â¢ > Her Young Girl Friends.
SURGEONS STRIVING TO
GRAFT HER A NEW SCALP
LAURA LAMBERT HAS BEEX MADE THE SUBJECT OF A DAWXO
SURGICAL OPERATION. AN EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO GRAFT
2SS SQUARE INCHES OF SKIN UPON* HER HEAD.
AGED VICTIM OF A LAMP EXPLOSION AND THE HOUSE AT 10SO HOW
ARD STREET. WHERE SHE MET WITH A TERRIBLE DEATH
FROM BURNS.
The dead woman has a daughter. Mrs.
G. Rugg. who lives at 1153 Market street.
It took but a short time for the chem
ical engine to subdue the blaze, for while
the room In which thÂ« explosion occurred
was practically gutted, the flames did not
extend to the remainder of the building,
and so the house escaped with but little
damage. The owner. Laurence Carney,
estimates his loss at but $100.
I the tragedy was whÂ«n one of the firemen
I burst Into the room and found the woman
lying unconscious upon the floor. She was
carried out at once, but it was found that
death had mercifully come to her Ions be
fore the firemen arrived. Whether she In
haled the flames an$ met death quickly
or whether she slowly burned to death is
a question, but it is thought that she did
not long survive the fierce attack of the
fire. As soon as the firemen arrived they
forced open the doors and started to sub
due the flames, and it was not until the
fight against the fire was well under way
that the body of the woman was discov
ered. She was lying on the floor of her
room near one of the windows, and was
evidently dead Â¦when the firemen found
her. ' '
An ambulance was summoned at once
i and.she^was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, but it was only, on the chance that
there was still life in her body. Her hair
was burned completely off, leaving the
tcalp charred and blackened, and her
arms and legs were shriveled and crisped
until there was little left but the bone?.
Her face was burned almost beyond recog
nition.
times.
Miss Lambert Is now comparatively tree
from pain, but while the skin grafting
process is In progress she can never re
cline. No weight must bÂ« placed upon thÂ»
delicate surface of her bead, and the girl
sits In bed, her bead swathed In bandages.
Only her eyes, cose and mouth are vlst
ble. and. nunllk* in appearance, she waits
for the surgeon's decision.
Thus far skin from different parts of her
own body has beÂ«n used, but she will
need much more than she can 'give. Know
ing this. Dr. Anderson has sought among'
her friends for the sacrifice of their own
akin, and he says that already six of them
have volunteered to submit themselves to
the surgeon's knif* thax their friend may
be helped.
One of the most critical in tie series of
operations which must be performed Is
that In which an effort will be made to
give the unfortunate girl new eyebrows.
And Dr. Anderson says that he will rely
upon Miss Lambert's sweetheart for this
sacrifice, the greatest perhaps of them all.
for the giver must sacrifice his own. In
choosing the volunteers girls of about the
same age and complexion and with the
same colored hair as Miss Lambert will
be selected. This daring surgical effort Is
perhaps without parallel, and It Is hoped
that success will reward it.
It was a daring thought to replace the '
lost scalp with, a new one, but Dr. An
derson determined to try. and the work
has begun. By the slow, tedious, critical
process of skln'gTaftlns the surgeon hopes
to gtve the girl a new scalp and to re-
Store, If possible, much of her beauty, as
she is a very pretty girl.
-In thisjra^lc. *vhich to tins layman If 'not"
to the -. surgeon Is a remarkable one, 283
square inches of skin must be grafted
upon the girl's head. Innumerable pieces
of living skin, in most cases about the
size of a split pea. must be transplanted
and made to grow. That the hair may
grow uponÂ« this surface full thicknesses
of the transplanted skin must be used.
The operation will be a long one and no
mistake may mar Us progress.* It will re
quire fully three months to complete It,
but long before that the surgeon in charge
will know whether or not success will
crown his efforts.
The first step In this painful and tedious
operation was taken yesterday, when a
thin Strip of cuticle, left attached to the
bsck only by a slender thread, was lifted
am? planted on the back of the girl's head.
The connection with the cuticle on the
back was continued. In order that healthy
circulation might be maintained. The pa
tic nt bore up heroically under an opera
tion which will have to be repeated many
She was taken to St. Winifred's Hos
pital and carefully nursed. She was saved
from further suffering, but her lacerated
scalp could not be saved.- It was torn
past all recovery. Then Dr. Winslow An
derson. In whose charge the girl was
placed, determined upon heroic measures.
He decided to give the girl, if possible, a
new scalp. He was determined that from
this new scalp hair should grow. His task
was a serious one, even in these 'days of
surgical wonders. The entire scalp of the
unfortunate girl Is gone. Even her eye
brows disappeared in the terrible moments
while she was being whirled Into insensi
bility. From her eyes to the back of her
neck tho scalp, was clearly lifted.
The girl for whom all this Is being done,
for whom the surgeons, are putting thejr
science to the test and for whom heroic
friends are ready for splendid self-sacri
fice is Miss Laura Lambert, the young
chocolate dipper.^who 'a few days ago In
a local confectioner's shop was~wnlrled by
the hair, of her bead on the belt of a great
wheel "and , dropped bleeding, insensible
and with her scalp torn from her bead.
It was thought that she was dead or that
brain fever would end the torture of her
terrible experience.
craft of surgeons can repair the terri
ble injury which an accident has inflicted
upon her. The physicians are testing their
skill In an effort to give her a new sealp^â
a scalp which will bear hair, not as beau
tiful perhaps as that which "was torn from
her head, but abundant enough to hide
the scars and the lacerations which mark
minuses of torture that she will never for
'get as long as she lives. Her girl friends
have volunteered to jflve parts of their
Â£ln to the surgeons' knives that she may
be restored. Her sweetheart Is ready to
disfigure himself that her beauty may be
returned, and the wise men with the
knives give hope* that ; the offerings will
not be In vain.

and nothing else. You represent the dis
orderly class that is naturally against us.
You represent the people who not only
object to prosperity but who don't get any
of It, because -you won't work. (Applause.)
Now, go back to your fellow hoboes and
learn after this (more yelling, and the
man evidently turned to depart) that you
stand against the flag. .You .haven't got
a particle of patriotism in you". I am
glad you are going away. I think you
have learned enough hereafter not to
monkey with the burzsaw. (Long con
tinued applause.) Now, gentlemen, in the
temporary absence of the local police, I
have driven off that disturber of the
meeting^" (Applause.)
At Newburg, as the Governor stepped
forward after being introduced he wa3
presented with a dinner pail filled with
farm products of various kinds. The
Governor said:
"This is what Mr. Bryan calls an as
sorted argument," and noticing that it was
wrapped around with an American flag
he continued: "Now. gentlemen. I want
to call your attention to one fact â they
have presented me with a full dinner pall
and the American flag." (Applause.)
Then he proceeded: "I come here to
appeal to you, no matter what may have
been our political affiliations in the past,
to appeal to you as Americans, as honest
men, as good citizens, to support .Wil

and there was quite a number of colored
people^ scattered through the crowds at
all the stopping places. ( Mr. Bryan evi
dently noted their presence and took oc
casion to address portions of his speech
especially to them, appealing to them to
do justice by the Filipinos, as they would
have justice done by themselves. The
first point at which he touched upon this
question . was at St. Albans. - There he
paid:
"When we complain that the -Repub
licans are applying in the Philippine
Islands doctrines that deprive people of
the right to govern themselves, the argu
ment that a Republican makes is that
some of the Southern States have adopted
wan? the black man to ask fr*m n>w ques

has no right to a vote, what about tlsÂ«

the colored man reply that he has paid
his debt ox gratitude. K Lincoln were
htre the colored man might vote for htm,
but thÂ» modern leaders or the Republican
party have had more from the colored
man than they have ever given him. The
colored man has bestowed Presidencies
cpon the Republican party and received
Janitorships In rettxra. I want the
colored men before they vote the Repub
lican ticket to know that the policy cf
the Republican party Is to send a few
white men to the Philippine Islands and
hold those white men In authority over
99 per cent of the population, which will
be brown, and this Is to be dene by a
standing army. Instead of using thÂ«
race question as a reason why we should
annex the Philippine Islands. let the race,
question be a warning to us not to brins
Into this country a class of people who
are not to share In the full destiny of our
nation. I want the Filipino to have his
own flag and his own government and to
work out his own destiny, and I want this
nation to stand by him and say to the
world. â¢Hands off; let this republic liver *
Mr. Bryan reverted to the race question
ta ; his speech at Charleston. There ho
said:
"Forty years ajro the Republicans saM
a black man should not sell for a thou-
honest. How would Tammany Hall feel
if that principle was read and applied to
its . organization? And now Tammany
Hall, which has reduced the government
of New York City to a byword, is grasp-
Ing for the government of . 'New York

I appeal to every Democrat whose loyalty

|^^ day of his first flying campaign
"* \ through the Empire State in
Kingston to-night, after -riding
eighty-five miles and making eight
epeeches, the longest being at Newburg
and Kingston. At the fenner place, the
norae of the Republican candidate for
Governor, he talced to a vast assemblage,
having to speak In two places. Specta
tor* interrupted the speaker with Ques
tions, in every Instance receiving a reply.
At West Xyack a man close to the car
cried and reiterated, "Hurrah for Bryan"'
and Mr. Roosevelt replied. "Why don't
you hurrah 'for Altgrld and Agulnaldo?"
The cheering ceased. Another called,
"What about the ice trust?" and he, an
ewered: "This election will be decided by
the patriots ar.d men of sense In the coun
try who outnumber the junker-shouters
of your type. The Ice trust will be at
tended to In a proper and legal way."
A man In the crowd at Newburg said In
a low tone of voice, "Why did you call
Democrat! cowards and dishonest?"
Roosevelt heard him, and flung quickly
this characteristic reply: "It'Â«.a lie- I
never said such a thing. It is Democrats,
good t^mocrats, who swell our majority."
Toward the end of his remarks at New
burg the Governor was interrupted a
number of tire* by shouts of "What la
the matter with Bryan?" "Down with
trusts!" Governor Roosevelt remarked:
"That gentleman has all the eymptoms of
a Bryanite," which sally was greeted
"with laughter and applause. Then, walk

which the ' shouta arose, the Governor

LONDON*. Oct. 23.â The Times pub
lishes the following from its cor

is safe to say that the visit of the
Chinese Minister to Llvldla. where
the Russian court and the principal Min
isters are now staying, and whence the
Russian Government Is directed with
more secrecy than would be possible here,
!s connected with an endeavor to make a
separate arrangement concerning Man
churia.
The Russians will continue to extermi
nate the- Chinese in the most ruthless
manner In order to protect the future of
the railway. A critical study of the offl
t?al re3orts shows that Chinese resistance
has been a mere farce. The Russians have
been only too glad of. the opportunity to
kill every Chinese soldier and to destroy
every vestige of Chinese authority in
Manchuria, and they have taken advan
tage of this farcical resistance with a
vengeance. ..-.., ...

Mr. Bryan also referred to the race
question in .other speeches during tho
day.
At Eastbank Mr. Bryan said: .
"I am glad that behind me I have those
who will be satisfied', with equal rlghu
and who will not ask privileges if I am
elected. I am glad that I have not . be
hind me the trust management, for if i
am elected I do not want them to hanÂ«;

they own me. I have no desire to' he'.p
to get your. hands into other people's
pockets. If 1 can keep other people's
hands out of your pockets I will do all
that you ' want to do for the laboring
man." Â¦ â¢
Mr. Bryan spoke to a congregation com
posed largely of coal miners at the littla
mountain town of : Sewall. He told the
people there that the - Democratic, party
stood for the arbitration of labor dis
putes and for a representative of labor
In the Ca.binet of the President. When
some one in the crowd asked him what
he would do for the old soldier if elected
he replied that he would appoint a com
missioner of pensions who would be more
satisfactory to the soldiers than the pres
ent one. After the train started to move
in leaving Sewall a man in the outskirts
of the crowd, apparently very much, in
earnest, demanded to know about Mr.
Bryan's attitude toward the ratification
of the Paris treaty. Mr. Bryan had the
train stopped and made a full explanation
of his action and position in that mat
ter. ' When this explanation was conclud
ed the same man asked " about the ex
penditude of $20,000,000 in procuring those
islands. 'To this inquiry Mr. Bryan re
"If you had read an article that I wrote
about a month before the treaty was
signed you would have seen that we could
have got it back from -the Philippines
In return for Independence; but If you
did not. I would rather consider It. a con-,
trlbutlon to liberty than as part payment
on men and their-lands."
When Mr. Bryan concluded his reply his
Interrogator, pushing his way through the
crowd nnd coming up to the Presidential
candidate, said: "I thought I had a right
as an American citizen. to ask that ques
tion." .!' . Â¦' Â¦
Mr. Bryan said in response: "You cer
tainly did have, and I am glad you asked
it." > ' â¢ â¢ \
The questioner joined In the cheers
which went up for Mr. Bryan.
The meeting at Thurmond was held In
a gorge in Â¦ the mountain and -the stand
from which Mr. Bryan spoke was perched:
upon a steep cliff on one side of the can
yon.
His audience at Thurmond was com
posed largely of coal miners, and he
warnÂ«Mj them against allowing themselves
to be Intimidated or their votes purchased.
â¢ The meeting at Hlnton was the last of
the day, and when it concluded Mr. Bryan
left for Washington . en route for Mary
land, .to which State- he will devote .to

speech at Hlnton. .When some one asked
him about the necessity for^a large .army
in this country he said that if the Demo,

an open-air meeting in Campau Square;
A drizzling rain commenced to fall a few
minutes- before he appeared on the plat
form, which soon drove to shelter all ex
cept a few hundred people who were
within immediate hearing of his voice.
These. hoisted umbrellas and came closer
to the speaker, who, af ter~" seeking the
protection of his -hat, stood his ground
against the elements and talked for half
an hour upon the issues of trusts and im
perialism. ?A noticeable feature of his
handling of the latter topic was the em
phasis which he placed- upon the Boer
question. Owing to the great number of
Holland-American voters in this section
of the State this subject is forced to the
front by all Democratic orators who visit
the Fifth Congressional District. Mr. Ste
venson took the ground that President
McKinley â¢ could not have exceeded the
bpunds of international diplomacy In in
tervening in behalf of the Boers , any
more than Cleveland did. in the stand he
took In behalf of Venezuela and ex
pressed .the opinion that the effect- on
England would have been the same and
that there would have been no South Af
rican war. His audience was plainly in
sympathy with him and applauded his re
marks upon this subject liberally.

Wyoming Valley is growing, and unicss |
the s-'trike is settled soon the miners will j
be hard to control. A majority of thÂ«
men ere willing and anxious to go to |
work.
Â¦ The discontent of the Ftrikers was j
thown at the work? of the Lehfgh and !
\Yilkesbarre Coal Company, in tbe east- j
ern part of the city, this morning. A gang .
uf men were going to work to screen coal i
on the bank of the Empire mine, when j
they were sot upon by a mob of men,
women and boys. John J. O'Hara, fore
man of the gang, was knocked down with
a stone and his nose fractured. Several
other workmen were slightly injured. ;
During the melee several shots were
fired. One bullet grazed the ear of a coal
and iron policeman. The mob destroyed
all the tools of the workmen. The trouble
took place within the city limits and a de
taehmtiH of police was sent. to the scene.
When the officers arrived they found a
large crowd of women and boys, but very
few.im-n. Â¦ ThÂ« local officers of the United
Mint Workers sÂ«y none of their men en
g'asetl In the fight! i
The police found" an efflgy of O'Hara j
hanging to a telegraph pole. .
Owing to the trouble there was no work
on the coal bank or at the Stanton wash
cry, operated by the same' company, to
<iay. The rornpany. used ..the coal screened ;
on the bank for their boilers, and hereto-'
fore the men have not objected to the
men fathering- it for that purpose, as It
was necessary to procure fuel in order
that the pumps which keep the mines free
of water micnt work.
Jt is .^aid Foreman O'Hara made himself y
Qbjecticnable to the wives of some of the'
strikers by boastinsr that he would work
despite ali opposition. This angered the'
women and <n several occasions Â¦- they
pelted him with stones. J
;3"his evening there was another riot at"
tin? Stanion washeries of the Lehigh -and
Wilkesbmre Coal Company. When the
workmen started to go to their homes
under the protection of the coal ami iron
police fully 5fÂ»00 people had gatherer. A
telephone message was sent to police
headquarters in this city for help, and
Chief of Police Kline and a number of
officers responded.
The men who had been at work were put
aboard a small mine locomotive, but be
fore the locomotive could pet under head
way some one fired. The police returned
the fire, but no one was struck. Another
volley from the windows of some houses
followed. Every pane of /Plans In the cab
of the locomotive was broken, but .no one
was wounded. Two of the workmen on
the locomotive Jumped off and were
knocked down and kicked, but were res
cued by the police.
The names of the injured men are Brad
ley Hoffman and John Dellsky. Hoffman
was so badly Injured that he had to be
taken to a hospital. As the officers were
returning to headquarters the electric car
on which they rode was stoned. I All the
windows on one side of the car were
broken and Police Sergeant Hall and two
other passengers were slightly Injured.
Mayor Nichols- soon reached the scene
and warned the mob that they were doing
the cause of labor more Injury than pood
He said the law would be upheld and that
he was there to help uphold it. The May
or's cpeech had a good effect and the mob
slowly dispersed.

A plebe'slirst night on guard is gener
ally an unpleasant experience for him:
for. besides the official visit ot the various
officers and non-commissioned officers
charged with his instruction; to see that
hÂ»Â» understands all the flnepointa-of his
duty as a sentinel, he is sure to be vis
ited by. a legion of spooks, hobgoblins and
various other unauthorized Individuals.
An incident of this kind 13 related where
a yearling wrapped In a sheet appeared on j
the post of a plebe sentinel at night. I
"Halt." shouted the plebe,". "Who i3
â¢there?" ' â¢ -
"Moses and the Ten Commandments,
came the response.
The poor plebe thought there was some
thing Irregular, but he remembered his
Instructions about never allowing more
than one to adVa'nce at a time at night,
so he promptly shouted:
"Advance, one commandment, to t>Â©
recognized!". . - ' - ...--Â». _
An amusing anecdote is related of Gen- i
eral Sherman, who, as commanding gen- ;
eral of the army, visited West Point one i
JunÂ» for the" graduation exercises. He ac- ;
companied the commandant on his Sun- ;
day morning tour of inspection of bar
racks, and on entering a certain room he
walked over to the mantelpiece. Stooping
down he pried up a-brick from thÂ© middle
of the hearth with his sword scabbard
and revealed a hollow space about a foot
square, In which was nicely packed a con
siderable quantity of tobacco and other
contraband articles. Meanwhile the ca
dets occupying the room stood mutely
watching and wondering what sort of man
the general was to have been able to dis
cover the only "cellar" of its kind in bar
racks. Turning to the commandant, the
general remarked: â¢
"I have been wondering if that hole was
still there. I made it when I was a cadet
and lived-in this room.". '-Â¦ Â¦ â¢ '
One, of the most.. interesting: ot- West
Point's- traditions is that relating' to the
billiard table.- Shortlyafter the Civil war
the cadets, always on the alert for some
new' scheme for amusement, decided that
they would like to have a billiard table,
and accordingly organized a billard club.
The authorities soon became aware that
there was a billiard table somewhere in
the barracks,' for they could hear the balls
clicking together, but'they could not find
It. The' cadets continued to enjoy the
privileges of the billiard club for more
than a year. Finally one night soon after
midnight, as two officers were returning
from a convivial evening at mess, they
saw two cadets, clad in their undercloth
ing and dressing gowns, emerge from the
north sallyport and disappear down the
steps to the area way in front of the bar
racks. Instantly the thought of the bil
liard table flashed through the minds of
the two officers, arid they started quietly
after the cadets. On reaching the base
ment doorway of the sixth division the
two cadets entered, and the officers,'arriv
ing a moment later, saw them climb over
a pile of coal and enter an* open door,
through which came sounds of' laughter
and conversation and the clicking of balls,
while the air was laden with fragrant
tobacco smoke. '
The officers paused for a moment and
held- a whispered consultation. Finally,
deciding that they would tell the other
officers of their discovery and have all of
them come down the following night and
enjoy the fun of a raid on the club, they
withdrew and went home. ' Next day all
the officers at the post were Informed of
the discovery, and it was arranged that
the raid should occur at midnight. All
micht have gone well, and the officers
might have had their .little fun,, had it
not been that there were three cadets the
previous night instead of two. The third
had forgotten his pipe and had gone back
for it, while the other two went on and
were discovered by the officers. The third,
coming along a moment later, saw the
officers and quietly followed them, ob
serving all their movements and listening
to their whispered conversation. When
they withdrew he went in- and told .the
members of the club all he had heard and
eeen. The cadets at once realized that It
was all up with the club, but they jde
termined to have a laugh at the expense
of the officers. Accordingly, all arrange
ments were 1 made before ; the j club ad
journed that night.
The next night the officers met as ar
ranged and crept stealthily down the
areaway and Into the sixth division. Hear
ing no sound of clicking- balls,- some be
came skeptical and concluded the whole
thing was a hoax, but nevertheless they
pushed on and climbed over the pile of
coal. Opening the door, -they were greet
ed with a glow of light, but still no sound.
On entering they found the room deserted,
but there was the billiard table, an al
most untouched keg of beer,- several
pounds of tobacco, some chairs and lastly
a note on the table, addressed, to thoof
flcers on duty at West , Point. The note
was to the effect. that as the officers of
the post had been so kind as to permit the
club to continue Its existence . for more
than a year. It desired to present to them
(the officers) the table and all 'its appur
tenances, as it was deemed expedient to
wind up the club's affairs. The note was
signed; "The Executive Committee."
-The officers, of course, were much
chagrined at being thus outwitted by the
cadets. Nevertheless, the table. was re
moved to the officers' mess and; accord
ing to tradition, is the one still in use
there.â New York Tribune. .
It has been the . custom- In the corps

during their first encampment. A great
many of the practices indulged in are per
fectly innocent, and so long, as the upper |

there is little or no opposition from the.
authorities.
There is probably.no place in the United
Slates where traditions and precedents
have .so ..much weight as they have at
West Point. These traditions are care
fully -preserved and handed - down from
one class to another, and it Is of the

informed the French Government that in
structions had gone to Minister Conger to
concur in presenting to the Chinese pleni
potentiaries the points upon which an
agreement had been reached.
"The Government of the United States
believe*." added Secretary Hay. "that the
happy influence upon the determinations
of the Chinese Emperor and of his Gov
ernment which the Government of the
French republic a-ntieipates as the result
of this step would be still further induced
if the powers were to include as part of
their initial declarations a collective man
ifestation of their determination to pre
serve the territorial integrity and admin
istrative entity of China and to secure for
the Chinese nation and for themselves the
benefits of open and equal commercial in
tercourse between the Chinese Empire
and the world at large."
It was suggested that this note hadtre
sulted in the Anglo-German agreement,
but responsible authority asserts that the
t nited States had no knowledge whatever
of tne. negotiations between Germany and
Great Britain, and a well informed diplo
mat said to-day that these two nations
had merely taken a step in advance of
the other powers.
Secretary Hay. it Is understood. Inform
ed Count de Quadt that as the first arti
cles accurately described the attitude of
the United States, this Government is en
tirely willing to subscribe to them. The
State Department Is yet in the dark as to
the meaning of article III. and Count de
Quadt was unable to throw light on it.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL WASHINGTON. Oct. 22.-Secretary
Hay has t&ken important action to cen
traJlre responsibility in China. After con
auluuion by cable with Minister Conger,
he haa instructed that diplomat to de
mand the abolition of the Tsung li Ta
niÂ«n and the appointment of a Minister
for Foreign Affairs who shaJl speak at
least one European language. The object
of this Instruction is to insure the p!ac
ln* of responsibility when future negotia
tions Trtth China are under way. The
Tsung 11 Yamen has been in the habit of
ffhlfttng responsibility for delaying action
upon demands made by the powers and
the United States, and it Is believed that
the other powers as well are united in the
opinion that their own interests demand
the appointment of a Minister of Foreign
Affairs. Mr. Conger will therefore reject
the proposition of the Chinese negotiators
that the Tsung 11 Yamen be permitted to
resume its usual functions.
It is the Intention of this Government
to make every effort to induce Great Brit
ain and Germany to live up to the princi
ple* set forth In the agreement which
they have reached. This agreement, as
published in the press, was discussed at
the meeting of the Cabinet this morning,
end during the afternoon Count de Quadt.
German Charge d-Affaires, called upon
Secretary Hay and handed him a copy of
the instructions received by him from his
Government, setting forth the text of the
agreement reached by the Berlin and Lon
don go\*ernments and calling the attention
of the I'nited States to that article of thÂ»c
convention Inviting the United States and
the other powers to adhere to the terms
of its proposition*.

At the State Department a message was

Ex-Secretary Sherman was known in-'

ly, to , Secretary of Stato John . Hay ever
WASHINGTON. Oct. 22.-The Im
mediate cause of the death of
John Sherman, who passed
away at 6:45 o'clock this morn
ing, was described as brain ex
haustion incident to extreme, weakness,
due to old age and to several attacks of
Bickness from which he had suffered for
the past year and a half. Since Sunday
afternoon Mr. Sherman had been most of
the time unconscious, rallying partially at
intervals, when slight nourishment was
given him. Yesterday afternoon evidences
of the approaching end were manifest and
he failed to regaln~consciousness after 3
o'clock.
Several days ago, realizing the critical
condition of Mr. Sherman, the members
of the household and relatives here sent
telegrams to a large number of the family
connections throughout the country in
forming, them of his extreme illness, and
some were able to reach here before he
died. Among those at the bedside when
the end came were Mr. and Mrs. Colgate
Hoyt of New York, Mr. and Mrs. France
Wiburg of Cincinnati. Mcs. William K.
Otis of New York- City, P. Tecumseh
Snerman.a son of the, late General Sher
man; Charles M. Sherman of Chicago,
Miss Lizzie Sherman, Mrs. James Mc.Cal
lum. the adopted daughter, who has been
Mr. Sherman's constant attendant, and
her husband. General and Mrs. Miles, the
latter a niece of Secretary Sherman, were
at the house the greater portion of the
day and evening, but left for their home
shortly after midnight. They were sum
moned when it was apparent that the end
was near - and reached the house a few
minutes after the venerable statesman
had passed away.
Where Death Occurred.
Secretary. Sherman's death occurred in
the handsome home on K street, which
he had erected eight years ago. Some
weeks ago' the Secretary deeded this val
uable property to Mrs. McCallum. The
Secretary was a large holder of real es
tate In this city. Conservative estimates
of his wealth place it at a round million
dollars. It is known that Mr. Sherman
left a will, but no information as to its
contents or even when if would be pro
bated will be obtainable until after the fu
neral.
The news of Mr. Sherman's death was
communicated to the State Department
by E. J. Babcock, for many years private
secretary and clerk to Mr. Sherman in his
various capacities as Secretary of the
Treasury, United States Senator and Sec
retary of State, and at present private
secretary to Secretary Hay. The Presi
dent was also informed by the department
and the flags on the public buildings In
Washington were lowered to half-mast,
so to remain until after the funeral.
The President's Tribute.
The President issued the following proc
lamation:
In the fullness of year* and honors. John
Sherman, lately Secretary of State, haa passed
away %
Few among cur citizens have risen to greater
or more deserved eminence In the national
councils than he. The story of his public life
and services Is. as It were, the history of the
country for half a century.
In the Congress of the United States he
ranked among the foremost In the House and
later in tbe Senate. He was twice a Vmem
ber of the Executive Cabinet, first as Secre-'
tary of the Treasury and aftervÂ«rd as Secre
tary ot State. Whether In debate durine the
dark' hours of our civil war, or as the director
of the country's finances during the period of
r-habllitatlon. or as a trusted counselor In
framing the nation's luwg for over forty years,
or as the exponent of Its f oreiBn policy, ; hU
course was ever marked : by devotion to the
beat Interests of his beloved Jand, and by able
and conscientious efTorts to Uphold Its dignity
and honor. His countrymen will long revere
his memory and see in him a type Â¦- of the
patriotism, the uprightness and the zeal that
go to molding and strengthening a nation.
In fitting: expression of. the sense of bereave
ment that afflicts the republic, I direct that on
the day of the funeral the executive offices of
the United States display the national flag at
half mast, and that the representatives of the
United States In foreign countries , shall' pay In
like manner appropriate tribute to the Illustri
ous dead for a. period of ten days.

Sellers, ..trainmaster of - the Iowa division

since the days of the Civil War. Mr. Hay
said of him: Â¦ â¢
In the death of Mr. Sherman the country has
lost one of its greatest citizens, a man whose
pome was Inseparably connected with all the
great events and policies of the latter half of
the nineteenth century, a man not only of
extraordinary ability but of the moÂ« spotless
character and whese personality, as well as
his work, will always be a model and an In
centive to the youth of the country.
Secretary Long was notified of the death
of his former colleague after reaching the
department. He paid:
I can only express my deep regret and un
limited respect for Mr. Sherman. He was a
remarkable manâ one of the eminent states
men of this countryâ and his name will be so
recorded In history. The country owes him a
dÂ»-bt of eratlUide for the service he rendered
while Secretary of the Treasury, In maintain
ing the national credit on a sound and con
servative basis.
Secretary Gage said:
Whether as a Representative, a Senator, or
a member ot the Cabinet. Mr. Sherman was
at all times a distinctive force. He had led
the forces In Congress which passed the re
sumption act In 1*74. As Secretary of the.
Treasury In 1877, it became his duty to carry

previously In Congress done so much to in
augurate. In the performance of this Â¦ duty
he had many difficulties to meet, but he met
them with the wide foresight, the steady
courage and the calm persistency which the
occasion demanded. History will. I believe,
point to that period aa the most brilliant in his
career and will recognize that in bringing: back
the national treasury to specie payment on
January 1, 1S79. he accomplished the greatect
and most useful work of his long and fruitful
f: President McKinley was greatly affected
by the news of Mr. Sherman's death. Ha

STORY OF WELDON'S
DEOWTJING IS TJNTRU2
Athlete Whoso Death at Cape Nona
Was Reported Explains Source
of Rumor.
A story has been current that Ray Wel
don. who is well known as a football
player and also as a member of the Olym
pic Club, tras recently drowned off Cap-*
Nome. There Is no truth in the story,
for V.'eldon was in the city not more than
four weeks ago. The facts are t^at just
before Weldon left Nome to come to San
Francisco he and a comrade put out In a
boat to a vessel lying off shore. There
they found two men who wished to take
the. boat buck to land. This they started
to do. When they were out a short dis
tance from the vessel a.- squall overtook
them and they were probably lost, as thÂ«y
have never been seen at Nome since.
People on the shore, knowing that Wei
don and a friend took the boat out. con
cluded when the boat with the two other
men in It disappeared that Weldon was
one of those lost. When Weldon was re
cently In this city he neard the story and
narrated the foregoing facts.

IS MOURNED UNIVERSALLY
BrÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call. \
STOCKTON. Oct. 22.-Judgre Budd to
day made a far-reaching decision when he
ruled that national bank stock is not as
fsessable in the cases of H. H. Hewlett
and J. H. Hough, who 6ued the county to
recover taxes paid under protest.
The opinion Is given in the Hewlett case.
Hewlett was assessed for 1100 shares, val
ued at flOO a share, the taxes amounting
to 11595. and Hough for seventy-seven
Bhares, the taxes amounting to Jill 65.
Judge Budd holds, briefly, that the Su
preme Court has decided that nationaJ
bank stock* axe not assessable for taxa
tion; try reason of section 306S of the Po
litical Code, and that the act of 1S99.
known as the Muenter law, has not mate
rially changed that code section. The as
sessment therefore is declared void and
tfce taxes must be refunded.

electrician at the Spreckels sugar factory,
died to-day as the result of an accident
on Saturday evening. An Inquest was held
tr-d the evidence fhowed that Norton had
been at work putting into place a new
motor for one of the powerful electric
hoists and was experimenting with the
machine when the accident occurred.
About the big <irum of the hoist there ex
tends a heavy pteel brake, or band, which
le operated with the foot, and this had
been removed from Its position and left
loosely lying around the drum. In start
ing the machine the unfortunate elec
trician grasped the controller of the motor
with hi? left hand, standing almost facing
the drum. The terrific speed with which
!t started to revolve threw the loose steel
brakp lever from around the drnm.and
the foot rest struck him on the rightlem
ple, crushing his skull. The foot rest was
afterward found imbedded In a solid pine
timber which forms a portion of the
motor's foundation.

ON A JUNIOR'S HEAD
Stanford : Seniors Attack a Lower
Class Man, but Fail to Get
the Headgear.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct 22.â As
a sequel to the adoption of the Spanish
sombrero as the official headgear of the
senior class H. G. Stevenson,,, a junior,
was held up on the quad this morning by
several upper class men because his head
was adorned with their approved style of
headwear. A brief scuffle followed and
at , Its conclusion the . transgressor was
found to be still wearing the hat. A large
crowd . viewed I the discomfiture of those
who had attempted to seize the offending
hat, and among them was -President Jor
dan.
The attempted violence does not meet
the approbation of a majority of the
class. .Many feel- that Stevenson should
be allowed to continue Â¦wearing this par
ticular style of hat, inasmuch as it Is the
same one he has -worn for -five years.
.There are others; who feel he should have
acceded to the wishes of tho majority.
The cause of the trouble was an edi
torial .which appeared In the Palo Alto
last week threatening the offending junior
with violence If he did not heed the warn
ing. The whole matter, including the dis
graceful actions of the seniors, will be
taken in hand by the faculty, and it la
not likely that another such scene win
occur. .
ATTEMPTING TO PROVE
AN ALIBI FOR ORTEGA
'Witnesses Swear the Pugilist "Was
Not at the Scene of His
Alleged Crime.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 22.â The attorneys for
"Jack" Ortega, the pugilist, who Is ac
cused of having assaulted little Grace
Gamble, are trying: to prove an alibi for
their client. The prosecution finished its
case this afternoon 'after producing
much positive* evidence against Ortega.
Dale Holland waa recalled this morning.
He testified to having seen Grace Gamble
get into Orteca'sTOug-gy, and later he saw
them as they passed him. Pete Savard
told of Ortega's movements on the night
in question and some admissions he made
the next day. Grace Gamble was recalled
and gave supplemental details.
Addle Bartlett was the first witÂ»ess 'for
the defense. She was- riding with Ortega
on the night of the crime and parted com
?iany with him at 9:45 o'clock. The lines
o his harness had buttons on them, but
no loops. This contradicts Grace Gamble,
who testified that the lines her assailant
held had loops on them. Dave Reedy had
seen Ortega in the Pacific Hotel at 5 min
utes past 10 o'clock. William Higuera had
ridden home with Ortega, reaching the
letter's house at 10:15 o'clock. The assault
occurred -between 9:30 and 10:30. -
Some interesting, testimony Is. promised
by the prosecution in rebuttal of these
witnesses.* 7- ;.

Los Angeles Contractors Agree to an
Increase of the Wag^es of
Carpenters.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22.â Nearly a year
ago the carpenters' unions of this city be
gan a movement to improve their condi
tions. Instead of asking the contractors
to raise wages the unions began to assist
the contractors in getting better prices
for'- their- work by getting many small
contractors to Join the union and work
by the day. The result has been that the
union has'kept all of Its men steadily em
ployed and the contractors. have been able
to. get much better prices for their work.
At the regular meeting of the union last
evening the report of different carpenters
regardinfj the .attitude of the contractors
respecting the raise of wages showed that
at least twenty contractors had agreed to
a $3 scale. Some wanted to wait until
their^ old work was completed, but rather
than lose their men they have agreed to
pay $2 75 a day on all the old work and $3
on all new. The new conditions have been
obtained without a strike and the carpen
ters are, as a result, extremely jubilant. Â¦

KOBBERY THE \ MOTIVE
OF ATTACK ON BODLEY
Assailant of the San Josean Was At
tracted by His Gold
Timepiece.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 22.â The , police have
been unable to find any trace of the man
who shot Deputy Tax Collector Bodley
last Â¦ evening. They I and I Bodley axe now
convinced that It was merely an attempt
at robbery and in the excitement the rob
ber accidentally pulled the trigger of his
revolver. Bodley had Just looked to see
what time it was and his golden. timepiece
evidently attracted the. fellow's attention,
for aÂ»she turned around the man said:
"I'll take that, pard." At this moment
the shot was fired. ' . .
Bodley had on a Bilk shirt under his
hunting coat and this Is believed to have
saved his life. The bullet penetrated the
coat and vest, but 'stopped - at the shirt.
A bruise about the size of a silver dollar
was made about four inches under the
heart. rvÂ«
The man turned and fled as soon as the
shot was fired. Bodley was partially
stunned. It is believed that if the fellow
had wanted to, kill Bodley he .would have
fired another shot at him. .

of the towns along the west side of the
county came representative men to tes
tily by their presence and speech their
fealty to the Republican standard-bearers

NAPA GREETS SENATOR PERKINS
MONTEREY. Oct. 22.â Within the past
ten days two attempts have been made
to wreck the Del Monte express by
wedging heavy pieces of iron into the
frog of a switch. Both times dfsasters,
accompanied by a loss of life, were avert
ed only because the train happened to be
running slowly and passed over the ob
struction without accident. To-day the
startling discovery was made that the
tralnwreckers are two boys who are
hardly more than infants.
These youthful miscreants are Arnold
and Irwin Waltz, sons of A. Waltz, a
tailor, residing in Del Monte Grove. They
are 10 and 11 years old, respectively.
Though. this f i3',the first, time they have
indulged in- mischief of a criminal char
acter, it is not thotr first offense In pre
petrating acts of malicious mischief. For
several years they have seemingly had a
passion for destroying property and have
caused no little annoyance to. the street
car company's employes by throwing
open the switch at the carhou,6e, near
which they reside. _
Their attempts to wreck the Del Monte
express were made "Just to see what
would happen," as they said when ac
cused of the act. Neither of them had any
realization of tho awful nature of the act.
Burned by an Explosion.
SANTA CRT'Z, Oct. 23.â Frank Arm-
Ftrong met a serious accident yesterday at
his eyclery. He was heating the bottom
of an air tank to remove a coating of
tar. The vent at the top of the tank was
closed and th*> heat formed a gas, which
exploded. The bottom of the tank was
blown out and Armstrong was horribly
burned on the face, head and hands by
the hot tar.
Needham addressed an immense open air
meeting hero this evening. It was the
largest local political gathering of the
campaign. Mr. Xeedham was introduced
by C. Linkenbach, who spoke of the Con
gressman's work in protecting the oil
miner against the rapacity of the scrlp
per. This put Xeedham into favor with
the oil men. who are sufficiently numer
ous to decide the election in this district.

SAX DIEGO. Oct. 22.â James D. Phelan
and J. C. Sims addressed a great crowd
at the opera-house to-night. The meeting
had been advertised for the plaza, but the
cool weather of- the last few days com
pelled the committee to change its plan.
The meeting was called to order by Pat
terson Sprigg, chairman* of the County
Central Committee, and Judge Joseph F.

SANTA CLARA. Oct. 22.â An attentive
audience listened to Eugene P. Loud and
E. Myron Wolf at Wldney Hall this even
ing. The audience was a large one and
the speakers held its 'jndlvide^ attention
for two and a half hours. Judge H G
Bond, president of the Cured Fruit Asso
ciation, was chairman. Bands and bon
fires contributed to the reception acoord
ed the candidate and his fellow-speaker.
This practically closer the campaign in

Bepublican Bally at La Mesa.
SAN DIEGO. Oct. 22.â The Republicans
of the La Mesa portion of the county
turned out almost to a man to-night to
listen to the argument of Hon. D. L.
}\ ithington and L. A. Wright on the Issue
from a Republican standpoint. The meet
ing was presided over by Dewitt B. Wil
liams, and the packing-house of the La
Mesa Lemon Company was well filled
The campaign of both parties in this
county has been very thorough.'
The obstruction they placed upon the
track in their first experiment caused the
train to rock alarmingly and if It had not
been slowing down to stop at the station
It unquestionably would have Jumped the
track. -On, the second evening the switch
was examined Just before the arrival of
the train and the obstruction removed in
time to prevent a disaster.
The Southern Pacific detective, who was
sent here to Investigate, noticed these
boys playing about the track and asked
them if they put pieces of Iron into th<?
switch frog. They answered In the af
firmative without hesitation â¢ and said
they only did it for tun, to see what
would happen when the wheels struck
the piece of rail. They were greatly
frightened when taken into custody and
promised never to do such a thing again.
On account of .their tender year* and ap
parent ignorance of the gravity of their
offense, they were at once released with
no other punishment than & severe repri
mand and a warning to keep out of
mischief hereafter.
They have been in the habit of late
ot playing along the track between the
Del Monte bathhouse and the Monterey
station, amusing themselves by putting
pieces of metal, sticks and stones on the
track and watching the wheels of the
train crush them and it was thus their
guilt In the more serious experiment was
discovered.

SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 22.â Judge
John L, Campbell of- the Superior Couri
of San Bernardino County has just ren
dered an important decision in the case
brought by the county of San Bernardino
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad
Company to recover .taxes with which to
pay for school bonds that were Issued by
Needles school district In .1890 for $20,000
for new school houses. The real defend
ant, by reason of a lease agreement, was
the Santa Fe Railroad Company.
. The school 'district comprised over 9000
square ' miles of territory and extended
from the Colorado River on the east for
more than, a hundred miles toward the
west and from the county of Inyo on the
north; to what Is known as: the San Ber
nardino base line oh the south. Through
this territory the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company had a railroad. It was as
sessed to pay its proportion of the taxes
to meet the principal and interest of the
bonds. The railroad company first . en
joined the Tax Collector of San Bernar
dino County from selling the property of
the company in the school district. claim-
Ing that a shoestring district had been
formed for the purpose of Including as
many miles of railroad as possible, and
thus placing a heavy burden on the com
pany. The county paid no attention to
this suit, but the Board of Supervisor?
caused an action to be brought in the
name of the county to collect the taxed.
In- the meantime tho Southern Pacific
Company leased its line of road running
through the school district- to the Santa
Fe and that company was by supple
mental proceedings included in the 'action
for its proportion of the taxes.
The case was tried before Judge Camp
bell last April at San Bernardino and has
Just been decided In favor of the county.
The railroad companies made their de
fense principally on three groundsâ first,
that the school district had never been
properly organized and was not a de Juro
school district: second, that it was not n
de facto school district; and third, that
the bonds were void because they were
made payable in gold coin instead of In
"lawful money of the United States."
It was upon the third point that so
much interest in the case was manifested,
for there are several millions of dollars
worth of school bonds and other district
bonds held by banks and capitalists
throughout the State w*hlch, like tne Nee
dles school bonds, are made payable in
pold coin. Had Judgre Campbell decided
the case in favor of the railroad com
panies it would have been a serious blow
aimed at the holders" of these gold bond
securities and would have shaken the con
fidence of those who have paid out so
much money on the Caith of the legality
of the bonds. It may be remarked that
all taxpayers In the district paid their
taxes as they were levied, the only delin
quents being: the railroad companies.
The county -was represented by J. \VY
Cuiyjs, District Attorney, and Frank B.
Daley of San Bernardino. Dunne & Mc-
Pike of San Francisco represented the In
terests of the Oakland Bank of Savings,
which had purchased the school bonds,
and Judge Charles N. Sterry of Los Ange
les, the chief counsel of the Santa FÂ«
Pacific Railroad Company, represented
the defendants.

for the position of guard. The final deci- >
sion of the athletic committee, however,

get back his amateur standing before an

TWO MEN SINK TO THEIR
DEATH IN HUMBOLDT BAY
Srecla.1 Dispatch to Tha Call.
EUREKA, Oct. 22.-John Christen
sen Jr., first mate of the schooner
Eliza Miller, and a young man
known here only as George, a
volunteer of the Spanish wai,
who recently returned from Manila, lost
their lives last night by the overturning
of a rowboat in HumboMt Bay. Accom
panied by Second Mate Iver Jenson of the
schooner Serena Thayer, they lÂ»ft Eu
reka at 11:15 last night for Arcata to
board the vessels on which Mates Chris
tensen and Jenron were employed. The
ex-soldier was engaged to bring the boat
back to Eureka.
There was no wind when the party
pushed off from the slip and everything
went smoothly until they were about half
way to Arcata. Here a sudden squall
struck them, a heavy sea swept over the
stern of the double-ended Whitehall ami
the craft turned turtle before the occu
pants r-eaJized their danger. All. suc
ceeded in grasping the boat, but George,
the landsman, soon lost his hold on the
rolling craft and was seen no more.
Christensen maintained his grasp for
nearly an hour. Jensen, who is an ath
letic fellow weighing 225 pounds, assisted
his companion. A sudden roll of the boat
threw both men off and when jenson got
his head above water Chrlstensen was no
where to be seen. Worn out by his ef
forts, he probably sank at once.
Jenson again reached the boat and was
buffeted around in the darkness for two
hours, when he was washed up on the
mud flats. After bailing the boat, he tore
a board from the bottom of the craft for
a paddle and reached Eureka at 4:30 thl3
morning.
Mate Christensen was a son of Captain
John ChriPtenscn. the well-known coast
ing- skipper and owner of the vessel of
which his son was mate. Young Christen
sen was a native of San Francisco, aged
23 years, and unmarried. Nothing Is
known of the ex-soldier, except that he
recently came from Hartman's mill, t ort
Hragg. He is supposed to have been of
French-Spanish descent, his parents re
siding in New York.
The news of John Christensen's death
came as a shock to his parents, who re

Just returned from the turbulent scenes
in China, on "The Kingdom of God as
Affected by Foreign Countries." His
address included his experiences with the
Chinese, principally before the time of

upon the yellow race. He told of one
man who, while not having professed
Christianity, refused to worship before
the Chinese gods and was killed by the
Boxers. He told also of the Christian
Chinese, who carried messages from the
l>eleaguered whites in Peking to the cuter
world, calling for aid and telling .of the
desperate straits in which the legations

of ~ missionaries in the various provinces
and of their progress in the spread of the
&C Dr Peck declared that the duty of the
outside world is to step In and assist In
regulating affairs in China. He believes
that the time -is ripe for the spread of
"Christianity and that the great mass of
the people of China are ready for it. It
Is a question of restoring the old or
inaugurating the new, he says, and all
China leans toward the new. In this the
Christian' nations, he believes, have a
duty and that duty is to assist in the
civilization of the Asiatic empire and to
spread the light of Christianity.

One of the most musically beautiful
works of the modern school of Italian
opera is certainly "La Gloconda" of Pon
chielli, which is being given at the Tivoli
Opera-house this week as an alternating
bill with "Carmen." The opera Is per
haps somewhat overlong, the plot too in
volved and complicated to . lend itself
gracefully to operatic handling, but the
luxuriance of the musical imagination of
the Italian maestro, his original and beau
tiful orchestration, .the wealth of melody
lavished upon "La Gloconda" â enough to
furnish a round half-dozen of the average
operas with ihe commodityâ leave a rarely
satisfactory impression upon the ear.
The scenes, too, and situations are no
tably effective. The staging of the second
act. with a real, live moon climbing "with
slow and stately step the heavenly hills";
the old Venetian courtyard in the first
scene, with its gay carnival crowd of
pretty Punchinellos, Columbines, monks
and maskers; the ballroom picture, too,
with its tragic intermezzo of monks pray
ing with lit tapers over the dead Laura-
It's all very picturesque.
Tivoli.
As you think back over the course of
Mr. Hall's play you see that with labor
ious ingenuity he has packed Into it every
theatrical device known to the stagecraft
of ten years agoâ the Unexpected Return,
the Overheard Conversation, the Man Bf
hlnd the Curtain, the Interrupted Ki?s,
the Comic Relief, the Good Characters ail
Very White and the 3ad Characters ail
Very Black. He has constructed what you
might call The Ideal Melodrama and ne
will have his reward. I hope he will not
be satisfied with it, but will attempt some
thing with a truer psychology and a less
conventional method.
Archer's famous definition of melo
dramaâ"Illogical tragedy, wherein the
hero is under the protection of special
providences, or rather of extra-special
providences." Captain Gilbert de Mont
ville (the soldier of the empire), should,
according to all laws of logic and reason,
have been 'killed several times in the
course of the play. He is not killed, but
lives to fell to earth two hireling soldier.?
and to toss into a millpond their wicked
majorâ all this to the immense delight
of the gallery, who rewarded the author
actor with three curtain calls. At this
gallery Mr. Hall's play is aimed, and
it . undoubtedly hits the intended mark
squarely. . If, therefore, you like this kind
of thing:, by all means go and see "A
Soldier of the Empire." It is a very mucJi
better piece of work than the English
melodrama, "The Great Ruby," which
held New York entranced for seven
months.
I don't know why one should come
away from, this perfectly conventional
piece of theatrlcallsm with a slight feel
ing of disappointment, unless it is, per?
haps, because Mr. Hall is such good a
actor that one Â» hoped to find him an
equally good playwright. That he Is not.
I suppose that Moliere's audiences had a
similar feeling, but for an exactly oppo
site reason.
Mr. Hall's support varied from good to
indifferent. In Miss Atwood the Alcaxar
really has an actress, and in Miss Stock
well a young lady who Is developing ii*o
one; Mr. Montaine is irreproachable, as
always, in emphasis and in point-making,
but Mr. Emery, in praiseworthy attempt
to make something: of an insignificant
part, overdid the matter. It Is quite im
possible that any sane man, so long aj
the law of gravity holds, could tumble
around as he did in the court-instruction
scene and there was no evidence last
night, except his actions, that gravitation
bad ceased to exert its usual force upon
the sun and the planets.
IN "A Soldier of the Empire," pro
duced at the Alcazar last night, Mr.
Howard Hall has , written a play
that, exactly corresponds to Mr.

I When a cheerful, brave and light-hearted woman is sud-
denly plunged into that perfection of misery, the blues, it is
a sad picture.
i It is usually this way :
1 She has been feeling OA"t of sorts for some time, experi-
encing severe headache a /id backache; sleeps very poorly
and is exceedingly nervous.
Sometime? she is nearly overcome by faintness, dizzi-
ness, and palpitation of the heart ; then that bearing-down
feeling is dreadfully wearing.
Her husband says, "Now, don't get the blues ! You will
be all right after you have taken the doctor's medicine."
But she does not get all right. She grows worse day by
day, until all at once she realizes that a distressing female
complaint is established.
Her doctor has made a mistake.
She loses faith ; hope vanishes ; then comes the morbid,
melancholy everlasting blues. She should have been told
just what the trouble was, but probably she withheld some
information from the doctor, who, therefore, is unable to
accurately locate her particular illness.
- ?^' Pipkhan* has relieved thousands of women from
lust this kind of trouble, and now retains their grateful
letters in her library as proof of the great assistance she has
rendered them. This same * assistance awaits every sick
woman in the land.

CONTRASTED ELECTION MANNERS.
SIDNEY BROOKS, a correspondent of the
London Chronicle, has contributed to that
journal an elaborate article upon American
election, manners as contrasted with those that pre
vail in Great Britain, and, while giving judgment in
our favor in most respects, concludes that our very
excellence gives rise to certain campaigning tactics
much below the level of anything possible in the old
ccustry- The article is fair in spirit and sufficiently
pertinent to the present canvass to be generally inter
esting.
Mr. Brooks first notes that the British pretension to
the honor of being the people who give the largest
amount of fair play and free speech in elections is
false. Speaking of contests in England he says:
"Every election sees a goodly percentage of heads
broken, platforms stormed, speakers hcwled down and
meetings turned into riots. The present campaign
has been no exception. At Oldham, Battersca and
Northampton, the spirit that was behind the cab
bages and rotten eggs and dead cats that used to come
flying like bewildering meteors round the candidate's
head in the good old hustings days is still alive and
operative. It has changed its form of expression
somewhat, but its essence is still the same."
No such tumults and assaults attend American
election;. The incident of the outbreak in a Colo
rado mining town against Roosevelt was a thing so
rare in our politics that it aroused universal condem
nation. : Similar affairs occur in England in every
hotly contested district So frequent are they that
they arc regarded as the normal incidents of a cam
paign, and unless serious injuries result from them
hardly any condemnation is heard.
Mr. Brooks has much to say of the orderliness of
our political crowds." He was in the United States
during the campaign of 1896, and in speaking of it he
says: "The excitement of it was greater than at the
bitterest moments of the fight for home rule, and for
fcur solid months the most ingenious campaign man
agers in the world tfsed every conceivable artifice to
keep it up to boiling point. Not a stimulus to passion
and even violence was wanting. In point of invective
the country was a magnified Ulster;, the smallest vil
lage had. its Bryan and McKinley clubs, its parades
and torchlight processions, its mass meetings and it3
rival wirepullers to 'boom things right along.' Yet
whenever I traveled along the Atlantic coastline or
2000 miles inlandtf found that speakers were listened
to as courteously and meetings conducted as free from
interruption ' as though nothing of greater moment
were at hand than a gathering in aid of some local
charity."
After describing, how quietly American political
audiences listen to the speaker and how promptly any
one who interrupts is silenced, or put out of the hall,
Mr. Brooks goes on to offer an explanation of the
marked difference in that respect between the two
peoples. He says: "Partly, no doubt,; it comes from
the American love of doing things according to rule
and regulation, of always observing the" letter; even
when they neglect the spirit, of Uic game they arc
playing. That, indeed, is the only thing that saves
their complex electoral machinery from l hopeless en
tanglement. Americans, too, are said to be an irrevc
rential people, but they dearly worship a majority.

THE FIGHT IN ThjÂ£ THIRD DISTRICT.
I ROM all reports that come to us it appears
{ fairly certain the Republicans will control the
next HocÂ«e of Representatives, but the majority
will be small. It is therefore important that the fight
in each Congressional district be made with untiring
vigilance and vigor. That is true of districts ac
counted safe as well as of those where the results are,
doubtful. The danger of overconndence threatens
the Republican party at almost every point along the
line, but nowhere is that danger greater than in those
Congressional districts where every one feels sure of
winning.
In the Third Congressional District Mr.* Metcalf
has something like a walkover. The district is Re
publican, and Mr. Metcalfs personal popularity and
his record in the House of Representatives are such
is to give the assurance that he will have in addition
to (he full Republican vote the cordial support of
manj independent voters. Every prospect for his re
election is therefore bright. The only cloud that rests
upon it is the probability that many voters may be
so sure ofjiis election they will not put themselves to
the trouble of exerting themselves to accomplish it.
California ought to send a solid Republican dele
gation to Congrefs at this election. The administra
tion and the House are to be Republican, and it will
he of ad\-antage to each constituency to have its rep
resentative at the capital in harmony with the govern
ing powers. Why should any California district send
to Congress a man whose whole energies will be de
voted to the barren work of opposition to everything
undertaken for the advancement of national prosper
ity? Why not send a man who will be a helper and
a leader in the advance movement, atyj who, by aid
ing others to promote the welfare of their constitu
ents, will have support in turn upon all measures de
signed to promote the progress of California?
Mr. Met calf has been tried in office. He has made
his mark there. His personal influence with the pres
ent House is strong, and it will be stronger in the
next. He has won the commendation of Speaker
Henderson and is sure of assignment to important
committees. By retaining him in office the people of
the Third District will materially benefit themselves
and help to augment the prestige of California at the
rational capital.

ANOTHER VIEW OF THE ARMY CANTEEN.
EDITOR Call: I was very glad to notice In your eiUtorlal en "Prohibi
tion on the Road," in. your issue of October 3, some very pleasant
words, as, "Prohibitionists deserve respect." and again of Woollev*s
remarkable and startling- campaign. "His crowds equal Bryan's at the
stations and enthusiasm 13 by no means absent." However, in the
leading Republican paper of the State, one that stands fcr cleanliness and
fair play and . which enters so many temperance and prohibition home*,
something additional should be said. It is not necessary for a great Journal
In supporting an administration to claim that every act of that administra
tion nas been the wisest and best possible. Such a claim weakens rather
than strengthens such support. The most grievous mistake of the present
administration is its toleration of liquor selling in the tropical Philippines to
soldier beys away from all home restraints. We are sorry to see The Call put
up any defense of the army . canteen.
President Schurman In his report condemns it and says that It (the
saloon) has "hurt the Americans more than. any thing- else." The army
canteen ia simply an ordinary beer" saloon, and whisky can be bought by the
bottle In most of them by either soldiers or citizens. This has been abun
dantly proved by men who have bought whisky with no -difficulty In many
tit them. John G. Woolley is not an "evangelist ol woe." Xelther he nor
any other intelligent Prohibitionist believes that "men can be* made temper
ate by ooercion." Because The Call opposes licensing prostitution in San
Francisco is It advocating making mnn and women chaste "by coercion"?
This charge of attempting 1 to make people "temperate by law** Is a carica
ture of Prohibition doctrine. If the Call means Â¦ when It says the people of
Maine are "as far from being total abstainers as the dry citizens of Arizona"
that th*re i3 as much. liquor-drinking in Maine as there is in Arizona, why.
The Call Is simply mistaken. We still fail to see how a boy from 17 to ;*
years of age Is prevented from drinking Filipino whisky by first drinking
American beer In the canteen. "We are not prepared to discuss the relative
virtues of Filipino and American liquors, but we do know that tha American
soldier boy had better get along without either. If the officers of the army
did their duty the soldier boys would not be shut up to the choice of beer
or '"slough water." This Is too often the case, notwithstanding the wate-
dlstllling apparatus which might supply every boy on tha flrlng lino with
pure water.
We are very sorry to see The Call come out in -defense of the army can
teen. It Is a very recent position for the administration and administra
tion papers to take that the beer saloon is a temperance agency, especially
for soldier boys in the tropics. I sincerely hope I have misunderstood The
Call's position and that it will yet take its stand in favor of abolishing the
army grogshop. , s. P. MEAD 3
Oakland High School, Oakland, October 22, 1900.
Southern Pacific lawyers are nothing if not unique
in their logic. Because a public pledge has been given
to remove the death :>i!s of the company in the Mis
sion the attorneys argue that the city has pledged it
self to inactivity. The same argument would give
license to murder because a protest against murder
had been made.
WiLLIAM P. LAV.LOR.
It is against public policy and the general pood to
rrake frequent changes upon the bench. When a
community has found a just Judge it should net set
him aside out of mere capriciousr.css of choice. Good
Judges are rot fo common that San Francisco can
afford to reject one of such rr.erif ss William P. Law
ior. On the bench, i$ in other walks in life, exp;
nence coanti for ranch. By the very duties of the of
fice the rr.en who hold it grow into a judicial habit of
thought, if they be men of integrity; but, if not, they
become the tools of corporation*, the dispensers of
favors to their favorites, and a source of corruption in
the very tcrrsple of justice itself. Men of broad minds,
oi firm impartiality, of derp learning in law and of a
disposition to do exact justice to all are needed upon
our bench. Judge I-airlor is such a man. He has
given proof of it under the test of arduous service.
Let him be rc-ekcted by the votes of nil good citi-
In tÂ£e present contest not a sirgle valid objection
o>n be mide to hi* re-election.. The members of the
bar. vrhsjndge him by professional standards, and the
public, that judges by the general integrity of his con
dvct. unite in commencing him.
When Judge Lawior was appointed to his present
j-csition ihe act met with some criticism â not that any
cr.e di?p*-tcd tht integrity of the man or his sbflity
as a lawyer, but he had never held a judicial position,
and some felt doubtful of his success in it. By reason
of that feeling the course of Judge Lawior has been
subjected to ihe closest scrutiny. He has been tried
by every standard by which the bar and the public
mra?ures judicial officers, and in no instance has he
fallen below the dignity or the responsibilities o: the
O SdOKG the candidates for judicial o5ce in this
f~~\ county meriting the support of all citizens
* * who recognize the importance to the comniu
nity of an impartial ar.d upright judiciary is Judge
Wi^iarn P. Lawlcr. He hzs been tried in oSce and
Lten found worthy. In coming before the people for
re-election he needs no other commendation to intel
ligent rr.en than the record he has made on the bench.
Under such circumstances it is a waste of time and
energy for the Bryanites to continue the 'campaign,
except in the case of those who are working now to
make a reputation for p3rty service that will give them
a claim upon the party for reward hereafter. Men who
expect to get nominations for Congress or seats in
the United States Senate, or some other office" in the
future, may go on with the fight, but those who have
no other thought than that of advancing the cause
of Bryan or of free silver or of free trade might as
well go home and stay there. .
Letters of a similar purport come from men of all
parties, of all shades of opinion in all parts of the
country. There remain in the Bryan coiumn none
but free traders, free silverites, socialists, the discon
tented and such old Democrats; as are too subject to
partisan feelings to follow even their own reason
when it leads them away from the Democratic name.
Among the men who have been stanchest in re
fusing tp follow Bryan on his new career have been
many of the conservative Democrats who repudiated
his nomination four years ago. For example, Rear
Admiral Belknap has stated ia a recent letter: "In
my judgment the questions that confront the country
most distinctively and mqst menacingly to-day are
those affecting the stability of the currency and the
integrity of the courts. It is idle to say that such
questions have now been relegated to the contentions
cf the past, in vie* 1 of the fact that the '16 to i' and
'government by injunction' heresies, adopted by the
Chicago convention of 1896, were insisted upon by
Mr. Bryan with imperial strenuousness and'reafBrmed
in submission to his imperious demand by the Kansas
City convention of the current year. The tumultu
ous beatings of the tom-toms of alleged imperialism
have but a hollow sound; they but, strike notes of
! simulated distress of no more resounding force than
the confined clangings of the alarm bells of the scenic
stage. To suppose, indeed, that Congress,- changed
in its membership every two years, and holding ths
purse and therefore the sword of the nation, would
ever permit a policy of real imperialism to be pursued
in any direction by the executive, is to discredit the
common intelligence, good sense, strong fiber and
resolute will of this people. Wherefore, in view of
such considerations as they appear to me, and others
I might name and more at length. I propose, as an
old-fashioned. Democrat, to vote next month for the
Republican Electors, as I did vote, for such Electors
four years ago. Whatever other Democrats of the
old faith may think or dp, such seems to me the best
course to pursue at this juncture."
f.li OLD-FASHIONED DEMOCRAT.
ONE of the notable features of the campaign has
been the complete failure of the Bryanites to
induce the people to accept imperialism as the
chief issue of the contest- A few men of many vaga
ries and of uncertain political equilibrium like Schurz
and Bourke Cockran have helped to swell the clamor
against the Philippine policy of the administration,
but the great mass of those who are sincerely op
posed to that policy agree with Senator Hoar that
the foreign as well as the domestic policy of the
country will be safer in the bands of McKinley than
of Bryan â that upon that as upon other questions it
is wiser to trust the Republican than the Democratic
party.
The legislator who accepts a bribe for his influence
and his vote ought to find it difficult to bribe electors
for the votes *hich will give him a chance to repeat
the offense. The voters of the Forty-fiist Assembly
District have a duty to perform.

would It be? I am Induced to believe from
his methods and utterances that his ad
ministration would most likely be Popu
listic. But no one can fell now what It
would be.
The "paramount issue" and Its twin
"militarism" are to my mind the veriest
of humbugs, absolutely unjustified by any
rational apprehension.
His foreign policy, if loglcaJ with what
he now says, would sacrifice what we
have gained in the last two years asd
would relegate us to the nerveless policy
of the pastâ a policy justly contemptible
In the eyes of the world. An American
is as good as any man and has as much,
right as any to all the opportunities, of
earth. This nation is a part of a world
that does net live by the Golden Rule; a
world in which one has to be prepared
and disposed to assert his rights and de
fend them; a world in which If one cheek
is slapped and we turn the other. It. too.
will be slapped and a kick thrown in for
good measure. This nation should nave
an administration that looks with a prac
tical eye to the best interests of America,
and one that will have the common sense
to deal with men and nations as they can
practically bÂ« dealt with. .
It is the duty of every American to vote
la accordance with his best convictions,
independently of what has been his past
party a filiation, for otherwise we become
sla\'es . to a mere organization, and I can
conceive of no danger to our Institutions
greater than that. When a citixen loses
fals senee of personal political duty he
makes the boss possible and destroys that
which alone can keep alive free institu
tions. JAMES W. OATES.

He has accepted the nomination of
three distinct parties that have only two
things in common â free silver and oppoel
tlon to expansionâ and which as to all
other Issues and In their fundamental
principles are sharply at war with each
other. If he should be elected he could
not at the same time give us a Demo
cratic administration, a silver Republican
administration and a Popullstic adminis
tration. He could give us one that would
be Democratic, or Populistic or silver Re
publican; or he could give us one that
would be a blend of 'all three. Which
He advocates a crusade against what he
Is pleased to term "government by Injunc
tion," which In its* essence is an assault
upon any government -that seeks to pro
tect life, liberty and property; It seeks to
strike down the necessary power of courts
and is a contention unworthy of Mr.
Bryan's high ideals. 'Â¦> il
His position as to those islands gives aid
and encouragement to the fellows engaged
in shooting American soldiers. If I had
no other objection to him, for this I would
not support him. Â¦
Judging from the tone of his speeches
he hae not a proper regard for the busi
ness interests of this nation.
He Is an academic doctrinaire and not a
statesman.
He advocate^ the ratification of the
treaty of Paris and is now trying to at
tain power and place by an unwise oppo
sition to the logical and necessary results
of that treaty.
He would have us extend a protectorate
over those islands, inconsistent alike with
their Independence and our responsibility,
impractical of operation, a burden with
out a benefit, a duty without the power to
avoid entanglements. ;
He opposes holding the Philippines, thus
advocating the shirking of a high duty
under circumstances that would be cow
ardly; would be cruel to millions of de
fenseless and peaceful people; a pollcy
that would Justly disgrace us in th* eye3
of a civilized world.
He is Insisting upon the free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, when the
only reasons that ever existed for it have
passed away, and every reason against It
has become more potent.
He opposes expansion, whfch Is Demo
cratic doctrine as old as the party, and
which at this time offers to this nation
and our people their highest destiny in
every proper sense.
There are many reasons, each of greater
or less force, that conduce to this belief
that he should be defeated.
Editor San Francteco Callâ Tnoascb I am
a Democrat it Is my conviction that the
best Interests of this nation demand the
defeat of Mr. Bryan, and this while I en

can that five are against him to convince him he is
wrong. That is just when an ' Englishman becomes
finally convinced he is the only sane person in the
room. Probably there is no country where minori
ties have fewer rights or more modest expectations
They are taught their place in most departments of
public life in the States, but at political meetings their
mere presence is only tolerated on conditions of
monastic silence. In America the majority is every
thing, and a man or body of men that feels itself out
numbered straightway and instinctively holds his
or- its peaceâ knowing quite well that freedom of
â¢peeeh is only allowed when the thin? spoken does
not run counter to the opinions of the majority."
The effect of the. good order of American political
meetings he believes to be not wholly good. He
says it has a tendency to keep the men of one party
away frorh the mass-meetings of the other, and con
sequently that the American people do not learn as
much from a political campaign as the British do..
He gives his conclusion thus: "The American pub
lic speaker can usually fed pretty certain that the men
in front of him are of his way of thinking. This, it is
true, relieves him of any m restraint in the presentation
of his case. I believe that much of the exaggeration
and flarnboyancy to be noted in American orators
ccmes from the knowledge that whatever they say
will be applauded, and the more strongly it is put the
louder will be the applause. It is not for ora
torical style or for a reasoned discussion of affairs th2t
oratory should go unchallenged. At the same time
it prevents the possibility of any meeting ending in
a 'disturbance of the pea<-Â£.* "
That there is some ground for such strictures is not
to be denied. The license given at our meetings to an
orator doÂ«3 tempt the demagogue to utter a good
many things thaf would promptly be proven false if
opponents were permitted to question him. Still Mr.
Brooks is wrong in supposing our campaigns are not
educational. The good order that prevails at our
meetings gives serious orators ample opportunity for
reasoned addresses, zr.d such meetings, as every
American knows, are attended by men of all parties
and have marked effects upon the.minds of the waver
ing.
JOHN SHERMAN.
litical parties are more changeable than in any other
State in the Union, with the possible exceptions of
New York 2nd California. It was a comparatively
easy task for statesmen like Clay, Calhoun, Webster,
Benton, Morrill and Efcine to hold long terms in
Congress, for their States are of the kind where poli
tics is subject to but few fluctuations. Sherman,
however, had to deal with a fickle constituency, where
parties are equally balanced, and where victory goe3
about as often to one side as to the other, and -a-here
every campaign is doubtful.
To hold oince in such a State it is necessary that a
leader be an adroit politician, a resourceful manager
of the masses as well as a statesman, and such Sher
rran undoubtedly was. Many a time in his career
he had to trim his sails to meet adverse public senti
ment and take a long tack to reach port in safety.
To that fact must be ascribed a great part of his seem
ing inconsistency of policy, and particularly the fre
quency with which he boxed the compass on finan
cial questions. .' â
Ohio has been a proliac mother of great men.
Many of them have deserved a long career in official
life, but very few attained it, and none other to such a
degree as Sherman. Their rivalries and ambitions have
made the politics of the State the most stormy in the
Union. Contests between the great parties have been
complicated over and over again by contests within
party lines, and by reason of these every eminent
man in the State has been confronted by rivals in his
own camp as well as by the antagonism of the leaders
of the opposing party. Of all the great men of Ohio
John Sherman was the only one who thoroughly un
derstood her people, was master of ail the currents
and counter currents of her shifting politics, and kept
his place secure while others went to wreck.
Strangely enough, the statesman who achieved this
difneu't task in Ohio was not in the slightest degree a
popular favorite with the rest of the Union. Although
he was strongly desirous of the Presidency, he was
never within reach of iL Again and again he went
into national conventions backed by his State only
to find that delegates from other States would not
support him, and twice he was set aside for other
Ohio men whom he had counted on as his lieutenants.
The people had confidence in his honesty, his ability
and his patriotism, but he lacked magnetism, 2nd all
his tact in political management never enabled him to
compass a nomination for the Presidency.
The later years of his life have been sad. His re
tirement from the Senate to accept the office of Secre
tary of State in his old age was a mistake. His resig
nation of that oSce iras inevitable. Since then he has
been but an invalid. His services in the Senate and
in the office of Secretary of the Treasury remain,
however, of continuing benefit to the nation, and he
will be ranked among the foremost of the great states
men of the war and the reconstruction periods of the
pZZjULL of years and honors, with all his work
I performed and his illustrious life rounded out to
a perfect close, John Sherman is dead. A figure
conspicuous in public affairs since the stormy days of
sectional strife that preceded the war has passed
av.ay, leaving a memory which" sill long be cherished
among the people and a record c: deeds that will stand
forever ia the amals of the rrptrblic
Sherman's career was in some respects unique,
since he czzzzed for so long a time to hold leader
ship and efzee in a State where the fortunes of po-

A PRETTY girl, very neatly
dressed, was found lying uncon
scious yesterday morning In
Golden Gate Park near the Chain
of I^akes by' Mounted Policeman
Kavanaujrh. She was conveyed to the
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that she had taken carbolic acid. She
never recovered consciousness and died a
little before 3 o'clock. She was apparently
about 20 years of age, handsome, with a
wealth of blonde hair that was tied with
a red ribbon. Near her was found In the
park a one-ounce bottle of carbolic acid,
half Â«>xnpty. It had been purchased at the
Model Drugstore at Twenty-fourth and
Church streets. The deceased was dressed
in a plaid polf cloak, a white sailor hat
with a white band and a pray tailor-made
cloth .<4:irt. She also wore a cheap imita
tion gold bracelet on her left wrist, a Me-
Kinky button and a brooch in the design
of u. Scotch dapper.
The carbolic acid was purchased by the
pirl about SÂ»:30 o"clock yesterday morning
frum H. H. Waugh, proprietor of the
Model Drugstore. When she purchased
the acid she was asked for what purpose
BbÂ« wanted It. She stated that she did
not want it for herself, but was buying: it
for a friend. She paid 10 cents for the
sold and at the same time purchased
s^m* castor olL She laid 20 cents down
on the counter and left the drugstore
without any further comment.
The mnoijnt the pirl was brought to
the hospital tl*e officials were under the
impression that she might be the missing
Oirrigan girl, but after they had thor-
Miss HJnckley's mother anxiously
awaited her daughter's return all day, and
in ihe eveninjr called friends to her as
sistance In searching- for her. The young
men read the account of the girl's suicide
and, visiting the Morgue, found the ob
ject of their search on a slab.
No reason can be assipned for the young
Kirl's rash act. She was but 16 years of
age. Her father and mother have been
divorced for some time and family
troubles may have preyed upon her mind.
The remains were identified late last
night as those of Mildred Hinckley. who
resided with her mother on Twenty-sec
ond street, near Guerrero. The' persons
who identified the corpse are C. E. Whit
ham of 1315 Guerrero street and J. C.
Smith of 1031 Valencia street.
L'p to a later hour the body of the sul
cidÂ« had not been identified, although a
number of people called at the Morgue.
The dead pirl was evidently employed in
some factory, as the first finger of h<Â«r
right hand was severely scarred by the
u>e of a needle. .
oughly investigated the case they found
no prounds for their supposition.
Mrs>. Otto Smith, who resides with hor
daughter at Twenty-fourth ' street, near
Church, soon heard of the news, and fear-
Ing that the unfortunnte one might be her
daughter she called at the Receiving Hos
ji'.tal to see the pirl, but the body had
ilreaay been removed to the Morgue.
Mrs. Smith then hurried to the Phirt fac
tory where her daughter is employed and
wa* overjoyed to find that it was not her
loved one, a? the latter had been working
all day. The mother and daughter later
visited the Morgue in the hopes of belnjj
able to identify the body of the voung
pirl, but coulO not do so.

TIME TABLE.
The Morning Star brought home over a
million in gold from the Klondike. The
treasure was In charge of Captain John
Lapgas. According to the captain the
wealth of the Klondike cannot be esti
mated. New mines are being discovered
every day and new districts are being ex
ploited from v:cek to week.
"The Nome fields are not In it with the
Yukon," said Captain L-agRas yesterday,
"and next year the streams tributary to
the river will produce tens of millions.
Nearly all the men who came down on the
Morning Star nre employes of the Alas
ka Exploration Company and all of them
are going back next spring."
Some of the passengers who came home
on the Morning Star tell etories about
the vagaries of Lane's railroad, the
"Wild Goose." It runs from Nome to
Anvil and its timetable is unique. In ex
planation it is necessary to know that a
Cheechaco is a newcomer and a Sour
Dough a man who hus been in the coun
try for at least a season. An exact copy
of the Wild Goose timetable is as follows:
Now the old missionary boat has been
turned Into a merchantman and' gold

NEW YOItK. Oct. 22.â To-day's furiously ac
tive and fcucytnt Fpeculatlon was brought up
with a enarp turn in the final hear of trading
by a fiurrv in the rate for call money which
c^ired it up to 5 per cent. This was accepted
aÂ» an admonition that the circulation was
overrunning the newly acquired resources of
the money msiket and very heavy celling to
realize profits immediately Â»et In. In stocks
rn<*t effected in the Belling, the early gains
VK>;e fcniirely wiped out and the average level
was entirely down considerably below the beta
of the day." The effort of the bull* to retrieve
their ground caused a very unsettled tone, but
the r-loeins was on the whole easy with the
buoyant snap apparently taken out of the mar
ket. Notwithstanding this late setback, there
were some very striking upward movements of
prices, especially in the Â»teel croup, and the
largest day's business in etocks eince th* earlier
part of ti* year was transacted at a level of
I.riots will tttwjve those of Saturday. Specula
tors reveled in the vivifying streams of gold
which are pouring Into the New York money
market from many yuartere of the world.
yt-Merday"s incoming steamers from Europe
brought the total receipts of the gold engaged
th< r- for export to over 13,000.000. and Saturday's
receipt of M.W>,OC0 at San Francisco can be
inade immediately available to the New York
money market Â».y telegraphic transfer. The
balance of the total engagements In Europe,
which amounted to upward of t&.OOO.OQO, is fast
following on the heels of the shipments al
ready received. Sterling exchange fell weakly
back to near the cold import point, and the
cntuinu<Hl downward tendency of Interest rates
In London anl Berlin seemed to cfTcr acquies
cence in the threatened further demands for
*rcld from Ne-jr York. It ir important to note
that the weakness of sterling exchange ie
largely due to the heavy buying of Etocks for
London- account, which amounted, according
to reliable estimates to 43.001) shares. The time
money market was dull to-day, borrowers ex
pecting lower rates and lenders holding out for
the higher rates.
There wae greatly Increased activity In bonds
as well as In stocks and prices advanced verj
generally. High trrade bonds were not con
spicuous In the dealings. Total sales, par value,
tZ.7CC.000. United States 3* registered advanced
ii l<er cent* on the la*t call.

CHICAGO. Oct. 22.â Dullness brooded over the
wheat pit nearly the whole session. The inter
est of outsiders was lacking and business was
therefore left principally to pit traders. The
market started out with a good array of bull
ish operations, but the response was very
weak. December opening only Â»4c higher at 71%c.
Liverpool was Â»4d higher; world's shipments
were only 7.4S4.0C0 bubhels, over a million under
Saturday's expectations; the on-pasaage (state
ment rhowed a decrease of 40S.OOO bushels, ac
cording to Board of Trade figures and in the
Northwest there was rain, with the signal
service predicting more of it. The market
fluctuated narrowly for hours, December at one
time touching; 74%c, but recovering to 74Â»ic.
Near the end of the session, influenced by large
prlrrary receipts and an Increase in the visible
supply, as well as the outside apathy, Decem
ber dropped to 74V4@74'/ic, at which the mar
ket closed %<gVic under Saturday.
Corn was quiet, but firm. December closed
Â»ic higher at 30?4c. Wet weather, higher
cables and shorts covering were the factors of

111S Broadway, Oct. 22.,
There is a hoodoo on freight train 278 V
that plies between Oakland and Liver
more. A week ago this train was hit hard
in a rear end collision near San Leandro.
This morning, two miles west of Niles. the
train was piled up in a mass of wreck
age on the Southern Pacific tracks. A
broken wheel on a forward freight car
caused the wieck. No lives were lost, nor
were any of the members cf the train
crew hurt. Some were in the caboose and
others were on the engine, which escaped
injury. The train was In charge of Con
ductor J. "Ward. The train crew was
blameless, because the accident which
caused the smashup was an unavoidable
one.
The wreck occurred at 7 o'clock. A few
minutes before the crash the car 'wheel
broke, but the train of, twenty-six cars
ran a quarter of a mile' before it was de
railed. Then the disabled trucks left the
track. The car twisted off Its couplings
and then down: upon it piled half a dozen
others, which were wrecked almost Into a
mass of splinters.- All of the smashed
cars were loaded with general merchan
dise, coal and lumber.

R. Z. Townsend, a clerk residing at 41

night that ho had been robbed by a man

he allowed William Snooks, whom he

him for the past few -weeks. Snooks was
out of luck and had no money. Tester

Reed's resolution declaring that It Is
the Intention of the Board of Supervisor*
to appropriate not less than $100,000 of the
excess revenue to repave accepted st/Pfts
in the business portions of the city was
re-referred to tbe. Finance Coramlttej at
yesterday's meeting. In Its report ihe
committee recommended Indefinite post
ponement of the, bill. Reed, however, said
that the committee had evidently failed
to understand the scope of the measure.
"The resolution simply declares our in
tention," said Reed, "to appropriate after
July 1, 1900. the sum of $100,000 for the pur
pose of repavlng streets In the down town
districts, and especially for the removal
of cobbles, which we have been specifical
ly pledged to do. The committee is in
harmony with the principle, no doubt, but
probably was under the Impression that
the bill is in conflict with the City Attor
ney's opinion. The latter, however, holds
that the excess revenue can be used for
municipal betterments after the clos* of
this fiscal year. It will then be In order
to take up cobblestone pavements and re
place them with modern roadways, which
is contemplated by the resolution."
Reed's old resolution that the expected
$200,000 excess revenue be used as a public
improvement fund was Indefinitely post
poned. Reed stated that he believed that
the board had the power to so appro
priate the money, notwithstanding the
opinion of the City Attorney that it had
not.
The ordinance providing funds for the
acquisition of land" for St. Mary's Park
square by setting aside JoO.OOO out of avail
able funds for the purpose and 'a pledgn
that the board will appropriate $50.0^0
more during the next fiscal year went
over for one week. Reed asked that such
action be taken, as he desired to have the
promoters of the Improvement heard on
the subject. The Finance Committee had
recommended Indefinite postponement of
this bill on the ground that the board had
no power to make any additional appro
priations to the budget.
The bill authorizing the Chief of Polica
to purchase such material as may be
necessary to provide the "Bertillion sys
tem of identification" In the Hall of Jus
tice, at a cost not to exceed $2500. was
withdrawn. Braunhart stated that there
was a doubt If funds were available for
the work. The resolution directing the
Board of Public Works to complete tha
photographic gallery In tine Hall of Jus
tice at a cost of $3160 was postponed for
one week, to ascertain If there Is any
money left In the Hall of Justice fund.
The resolution granting the Presidio and
Ferries Railway permission to set back
four feet the south curb of Union street,
between Hyde and Larkln streets, on con
dition that it reconstruct the cable sys
tem within four years, was re-referred to
the Judiciary Committee. The company
is required by the ordinance to file a bond
In the sura of $20,000 for the performance
of the work, and with the understanding
that the tracks in the block named must
be put back In the center of the street.
Brandenstein stated that the company de
sired to be heard in regard to the exac
tion of the bond.

Democracy Stands For.
Judge louderback States What
Republicans of the Thirty-ninth Assem
bly District held a well attended meeting
In Saratoga Hall last night. The chair
Â¦was occupied by W. H. Bodfish. Ad
dresses were made by many of the candi
dates on the ticket, amonsr them being
r>R.vis Louderback. candidate for Superior
Juflge. who spoke in part as follows:
"The situation Is this: Bryan stands
ready to rull down the starry banner
which floats to-day over American isl
ands, placed there by American blood and
American heroism. Bryan stands ready to
throw open the mints of America to the
Â»-ilver of the wcrld, thus debasing- our dol
lar to 4S cents. In Mexico to-day you can
get two of their doilars with one Ameri
can dollar, because they have no gold
ttaxidard there.
"The Democratic platform Is an unpa
triotic platform, and this forced issue of
imperialism is a false issue. The acquisi
tion nf these islands of the Pacific is go
ir.er to afld to tlie wealth and preatness of
this country. Th< ir acquisition means
that with the added commerce which will
occrup. our factories will run twelve
months instea l of eight, as heretofore.
These islands a.re ourx forever, and God
forbid that any Democrat should take
them from us."
Following Judge Louderback's address
John G. Tyrrell, candidate for State Sen
ator from the Twenty-third District,
ppoke briefly. He refuted the report that
â¢he would vot3 against a primary law,
and declared that if elected he would
make every effort to secure one.
Short speeches were also made by
Thomas F. Dunn and Percy V. Long, can
didates for Justice of the Peace; F. D.
Macbeth, candidate for the Assembly
from the Thirty-ninth District: ex-Judge
II. L. Joachimsen. candidate for Justice
of the Peace, and by B. V. McKinlay.
The Thirty-ninth District Club Is mak-
Irg arrangements for a big mass-meeting,
to be held in Saratoga Hall at an cau
date.
M. J. Carey, an employe of the Inde
pendent Electric Light Company, was al
most instantly killed about 6:30 o'clock
last evening in front of the City Hall on
McAllister street. He was on an electric
light pole engaged in trimming the lamp
and received a slight shock, not exceed
ing 110 volts. This was, however, sufficient
to cause him to lose his hold. He fell to
the pavement, a distance of about fifteen
feet. Ho was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Bunnell found that his
skull was fractured. Ten minutes after
he was placed on the operating table he
died. His body was removed to the
Morgue.

to have a son engaged In the grocery busi

Employe of Independent Electric
"Hochfeld had just deposited his load of
loam and was returning homeward. He
drove out of thf cemetery pates and
across the tracks, when the whistles were
blown. Hochfeld did not appear to hear
them and continued on his way. The
train struck the horses and In a moment
all were an indescribable mass of debris.
Both horses were killed, Hochfeld was
thrown from his seat and made a curve
through the air, landing fully 100 feet
away from the spot where he was struck.
The train was stopped a few feet beyond
the cemetery, but all that could be done
had been when the crew came on the
scene. If the driver had used ordinary
care the accident might have been
avoided."
den. Superintendent Blaine In describing
the accident paid:
Jasper Hochfeld, a teamster employed
by William Rayburg, a livery stable
keeper at Baden, was Instantly killed
about 5:30 o'clock last evening as he was
driving out of Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
Hochfeld had been employed for several
months in the same capacity and was
apparently familiar with train move
ments.
He had just deposited a load of fertiliz
ing material and was on his way home
when he attempted to cross the tracks of
the railroad just in front of the entrance
of the cemetery as the San Jose train that
left San Francisco at 5 p. m. was ap
proaching. Two long and one short bla3t
of the whistle were sounded by the en
gineer as a warning to the teamster, but
Hochfeld did not heed them. He whipped
his horses, Intending to cross In front of
the train, but his team was too slow and
the heavy wagon was a further impedi
ment to the success of his plan.
The locomotive struck the horses and
hurled them, the driver and the wagon
Into the air. Where Hochfeld landed
was at least ninety feet from the place
where the team was struck. His' head
struck on one of the posts used by the
railroad company to Indicate the clear
ing points of the main and side tracks.
This is a small square stake, not over
two Inches square on top and not exceed
ing three inches In height above tne
ground. Hochfeld's head struck fairly
upon the stake and his skull was crushed.
Superintendent Blaine of Cypress Lawn
Cemetery was a witness of the accident
and rushed to the man's assistance, but
he was dead.
The body was removed to the receiving
vault of the cemetery, and a Coroner's
jury was summoned some hours later by
Justice of the Peace Cunningham of Ba-

Eugene B. Worrell of Boston*, president
Â©f UÂ»Â« Sherman-Worrell Fruit Company,
Is authority for the statement that- a fac
tory will be established in this city to con
dense fruits of California for the markets
of the world. Machinery to cost $00,000 at
least will be made this winter, to tÂ»e In
readiness for next jammer. The plant
will have a capacity for turning out a
practically unlimited amount of the fruit
m condensed form. Mr. Worrell, who is
e-t the Orand Hotel, said yesterday that
the demand will bo immense and he is
confident that the new enterprise will be
of great importance to California fruit
growers.
Daniel Sherman of Xeweas tie, Placer
County, is the inventor of a new process
which turns ripe fruits, fresh from the
trees, into a compound which, according
to the claims made for it, retains ail the
juice and ail the flavor or the fruit from
Â¦which it is made and which resists all ex
tremes of climate without the use of any
freservatlves. Some time ago Daniel
Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, his
t>rothÂ»r. visited Boston and made known
his discovery. The result was the organ
ization of the Sherman-Worrell Fruit
Company, which was incorporated under
the laws of New Jersey. Stock was sold
In Boston an.onp business men sufficient
to provide for the necessary machinery-
The Messrs. Sherman had already pro
duced the condensed fruit with somewhat
crude machinery, so it was easily shown
what could be done.
Mr. Worrell said yesterday that the new
industry would not conflict with any other
connected with the marketing of Califor
nia fruits. It would fimply add another
method for utilizing fruits and presenting
them to the public for use In winter, with
the pdvajuape of having- in them full
flavor and nutriment unimpaired. Six
rnursi?* of fruit can be condensed into one.
Experiments: have demonstrated that the
condensed fruits are as pood at the end
cf three years as when they were origin
ally treated. Mr. Worrell has samples of
the fruit, which Is solid and has evidently
been molded. He says confectioners,
bakers and all housekeepers â¢will use it.

GRAPE-NUTS.
STRUCK IT RICH
When They Needed It Bad.
"When a two months' old baby re-
fuses to nurse and cannot digest any oi
the "baby foods' or cow's milk prepared
in different ways we must do something
or lose the baby. That was the condi- |
tion of our little one about a year and
a half ago.
"\Ve tried every baby food on the
market, besides the cow's milk, but
nothing seemed to agree with him. He
suffered from indigestion, until by the
time he was nine months old he had
grown so weak and emaciated that we
didn't think he could live. At last his
stomach refused to take anything, and
for three days the little fellow was ac-
tually starving for something: he could ,
digest. l-^r^i :-"^O
"I happened to have a box of Grape-
Nuts in the house, and, getting a tea-
spoonful, poured a little hot water over
it, letting the food stand a few min-
utes, then gave the baby the brown
â¢water, which had the streneth of the
Grape- Nuts in it. He could take but
two spoonfuls at a time and then rest a
while.
"His stomach retained the food and
after one day's use of the Grape-Nuts in
this way his bowels were right, for the
first time in six months. I continued to
feed him the water from the Grape-Nuts
and a little cream and later on the
softened food itself, and he steadily im-
proved, his little body and limbs begin-
ning to get round and plump, and by
the time he was a year old he was as
large again as when nine months old.
At 15 months he weighed 2% pounds,
and now. at 18 months, he is a great, fat,
jolly baby, climbing and froinsr every-
where, full of fun, rosy cheeks and
bright eyes.
"During all this time his food has
been Grape-Nuts: just the water at
first, then later on he had the food it-
celf. He is the best advertisement
Grape-Nuts could have in this town, for
every one knew his condition no
one thought he could possibly live. We
give all the praise to this most valuable
food, and never lose an opportunity to
recommend it to persons sufferine from
indigestion and lack of nourishment-"
Mrs. C. D. Johnston. Greenfield. Ind.
Actual proof is better than all theory,
vet it 5 s well to know that Grape-
N'uts food is made scientificallv and
made for a purpose. The most power-
ful elements in wheat and barley are
used and so prepared as to furnish the
human body with those food elements,
predifjested in a natural manner: that
is, turned from starch into grape-sujrar.
The food is powerful enoush for
athletes and easy enoutrh of dieestion
(a.% shown by the above experience) for
the weakest babe.THE 'SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAY,* OCTOBER 23, 1900.

A TURF WONDER
As to whether Ed Cole or Francis
Trevelyan will be selected to act as asso
ciate judge at Tanforan Park seems to
give a whole lot of people much concern.
Either would no doubt fill the position
ably, but .this does not seem to suit the
"Knockers' Protective Association."
w' 'ch is furnishing gratuitous informa
tion to the Tanforan Association. It would
seem that after a transplanted native son
had secured a snug berth he would re
serve his opinion; at least good taste
would dictate such. Xone of the Eastern
newspaper brigade that ever came this
way were ever brevettod for gallantry In
action, but there is no telling what tno
coming engagement will bring.
Starter Dick Dwyer will not bring his
rubber starting gate out with him. Tho
gate will later be picked by the directors
of the San Francisco Jockey Club.
It seems the Maxwell, and not the Gray,
gate will be used at Oakland track. The
barrier of the first named starting ma
chine consists of a most formidable piece
of network and the riders who endeavor
to beat It will bump up against a stone
wall. Willie Flynn tried it three years
ago at Denver and suffered the fracture
of one wrist. It is an excellent contriv
ance.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman was about
town yesterday renewing old acquaint
anceship.
â¢ From the present outlook Bullman and
Henry will be the star jockeys and their
followers ought to get all the money.
The stables of Sam Hildreth and Green
B. Morris are due to arrive at Oakland
track October 26.
Once $15,000 behind the Chicago racing
game Bookmaker Joe Rose la now $30,000
to the good. A report was spread broad
cast that Rose handled the jumper Lord
Chesterfield, in a race at Hawthorne some
weeks ago which received extensive pub
lication in California papers. It proved
a malicious rumor and the penciler was
completely exonerated by the officials at
Hawthorne. On his arrival here Rose will
ask the Oakland association to reconsider
the ruling made against him last "ear. -
L. A. Â¦ Legg has picked up a rather use
ful bunch of platers around Chicago and
unless he disposes of them hU colors will
be seen here this winter.
The horses of "Doc" S. W. Street ar
rived at Oakland track from St. Louis
yesterday. Hungarian, Doublet, Sweet
Caporal and some nine others will carry
the "doctor's" colors. Coburn does his
riding. It was said that two or three of
"Curly" . Brown's horses came on the
same car.
Charles L. Fair, one of the heaviest
stockholders in the San Francisco Jockey
Club, left for a five weeks' trip East yes
terday., Mrs. Fair accompanied Â¦ her hus
band.
Charley Saunders says Headwater and
his other two horses stood the trip from
Chicago well. They are quartered at Oak
land track, where stable room is rapidly
becoming scarce.
California is alway3 glad to extend the
hand of friendship to a true sportsman
and Pat Dunne, as he went the rounds
yesterday, was kept busy greeting his old
friends. Pat passed the slope up last
year, but was not forgotten, and this sea
son his stable, which is now snugly en
sconced-at Ingleside, will have a strong
following. He said yesterday that more
than likely Tommy Knight would do his
riding. His stable consists of Star Cham
ber, Scales, Nansen, Maclaren. Bonnio
Lissak, FcMido, Benson, Tola. Silurian,
Golden, Caldwell, Ben Alder and Iroma.
Trainer Mike Kelly is busy at Ingle
side preparing Eddie Jones, Scotch Plaid,-
Pat Alorrissey, Miss Rowena, Mortgage,
Duckoy, Lucidia. Ella Boland and oth
ers. David Tenny would not stand train
ing and will likely be retired. '<
Billy Randall is still in tears over his
San Jose trip. If the management of the
Garden City track ever receive the State

McCarthy Directs Attention
of Board to Charfer
---' Violation.
Supervisor McCarthy introduced a reso
lution at yesterday's meeting of the board
which directs the Finance Committee to
Investigate the accounts of the City
Treasurer. This action is the result of
the discovery made by McCarthy last
week that the Treasurer had cashed un
registered demands to the exclusion of
those which had been registered. Brami
hart objected to the suspension of the
rules to take up consideration of the reso
lution on the ground that it stated as a
fact certain things which the committee
is directed to investigate.
"We do not know for a fact that the
Treasurer paid unregistered demands."
said Braunhart.
"You know it Is a fact," said McCarthy
to Braunhart, "for your demand was
among those cashed, though It was not
registered." , \
But Braunhart pleaded Innocence, and
at Cointe's suggestion the resolution was
amended by the insertion of the phrase,
"it is alleged." before all the charges
contained therein. The motion to suspend
the rv'es to vote on the adoption of the
bill was lost, failing to get a two-thirds
vote, and it was then referred to the com
mittee. The resolution follows:
Â¦ Whereas, The Treasurer of this city and
county declared that there would not ba suffl
cient moneys in the general fund to pay the
demands against the same for the month or
June last: and ~ Â» lV
Whereas. It is alleged a great many of the
holders of said demands, In order to insure
the prompt payment of their claims from such
funds aa might come Into the treasury, regis
tered said demands In the offlce of the Treas
urer in accordance with section 6 of chapter
3, article 4 of the charter; and
Wherea*. It Is -alleged the Treasurer, in .ab
solute and open violation of all law. failed and
n<Â»RlecteÂ«i to pay all such registered demands,
or any of them, in "the order of their registrar
tion. but elected Instead to pay the unreirl!*
tered demands of other parties which were
presented long after hundreds of registered de-,
niands were on file, thereby causing Injustice
and delay to those irho complied with the law
by registering their demands as aforesaid: and
Whereas, When the Deputy Treasurer was
asked to explain the payment of unregistered
demands as aforesaid his only reply was that
It was due to the pressure of influence and
was a common practice: therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Finance Committee be
directed to at once investigate the accounts
of the Treasurer, and if the facts are found
to be as set forth above thÂ«y report the same
to his Honor, the Mayor, that he may take
such proceedings against the Treasurer aa are
authorized by law. Â¦ ' . -^

in the warrant and bond clerk's office In
the Hall of Justice to connect with other

pense should be Incurred. The resolution

Â¦ UDOLPH, COUNT FESTETICS
| J DE TOLNA. in an answer filed
f^^ yesterday to the complaint for
M. divorce recently filed by Ella.
Countess Festetics de Tolna, as
sumes an injured air and places all blame
upon his wife for their unhappiness. By
way of Introduction to his answer the
Count avers that he Is a native of the
Austro-Hungarlan Empire and always has
been a citizen and resident thereof. His
home, he says, Is In Vienna, where he now
resides.
Immediately after their marriage, Count
Festetics says, they made a journey to
Florida, which occupied about two
months, and then went to New York,
where they stayed another month. Sub-
A general denial to each and all of the
allegations of cruelty and non-support
made by Countess Festetics is next incor
porated In the answer, special' stress be
ing placed on the denial that the yacht
Tolna, aboard which Countess " Festetics
complains she suffered the most, was un
fit for the purpose' to which it was put,
and that during the cruise from the Ad
miralty Islands to Yokohama it narrowly
escaped being wrecked, as the Countess
contends.
sequently they returned to San Francisco
at the solicitation of Countess Festetics'
parents, and remained there until the end
of October, 1893, while they awaited the
completion of the yacht Tolna, which was
being built. in San Francisco. Count Fes
tetics avers that the yacht was a' very
strong, seaworthy vessel, designed for
long voyages and provided with all the
luxuries and comforts of a pleasure yacht
and arranged especially to meet the re
quirements of Countess Festetics.
Count Festetics further avers that with
his wife he remained a greater part of
the time in the best hotels Â¦when in for
eign lands, though always ready to re
turn to the yacht "because of the greater
comfort It afforded." While at Yokoha
ma and Kobe Count Festetics alleges that
with his wife he lived on shore, taking
part In all the entertainments of the best
society there. At San Dakan he says
they lived at the home of the Governor,
and at Singapore they also resided con
tinuously at the Governor's palace. He
further avers that in January, 1899, the
Countess, for the first time, expressed a
wish that hÂ« would give up yachting and
live on shore. He further says that he
told his wife that It was necessary for
him to go to Trieste to pass his examlna
tion as a ship captain, but that after h.
had passed his examination there hi
would go with her to America, To thl:
agreement she assented fully, he says.
On the 5th day of April. 1899, at Singa
pore, he continues, it was agreed between
them that the Countess should return to
her parents. Without his knowledge,
Count Festetics alleges, his wife tele
graphed to her. parents for money and in
reply received from her father a large
sum. She then told him, he says, that If
Â«he had not received the money she would
have remained with him, but that In any
event she would Join him again at Aden
or Trieste. â¢
.Count Festetics continues and says that
his parting with his wife was affectionate,
and that on April 20, 1S99, he started for
Colombo and thence to Trieste, but did
not learn of the divorce proceedings until
he reached Vienna. In conclusion. Count
Festetics alleges that his wife voluntarily
and without his consent left him and has
never since asked him for support or
maintenance.
The answer is sworn to by Rudolph.

To-day from 1 o'clock till 5 will take
place the grand promenade concert and
high .tea at St. Brigid's Fair that is being
held In the Mechanics' Pavilion. The con
cert will be under the direction of Profes
sor Harrison, and one of the features of
the programme will be a violin selection
by Miss Violet Johnson, who, though only
14 years of age, is one of the cleverest
performers on the Instrument in this city.
Mrs. Tillman in the refreshment booth
has made elaborate arrangements for the
affair.
Last night a number of the wares that
have not been sold were auctioned off by
Messrs. S. B. Levy. C. E. Da
vls and M. E. Mayer. They worked
hard all the evening, and through
their energetic efforts a large num
ber of articles were disposed of at
good prices. The different contests are
still exciting great interest. The vote for
the most popular candidate for the As
sembly from the Forty-first is in favor of
Oscar Sutro. He has-3S5 votes as against
374 for Dibble.
The surplice donated to the â¢ favorite
priest will certainly go to Father J. A.
McAullffe unless Father C. A. Ramm's
friends come to the front to-night with
about fifty votes. Judge Dalngertteld
seems to be the popular candidate for
Superior Judge.
Remember that to-night will be the
closing ceremonies of the bazaar. All the
goods will be auctioned oft and the raffles
will be decided.
SOLDIER LOVER
PROVES HE IS A
MAN OF ACTION
Travels Fifteen Hundred
Miles to Reclaim Fickle
Sweetheart.
Overtakes Eloping Couple at Newton,
Iowa, and the Girl Discards
New Love for the
Old.
That "faint heart ne'er won fair lady'"
was ever the thought uppermost in the
mind of Ernest Coleman. private in the
hospital corps at the Presidio, and when
he received a letter from his. lady love ia
far-away Kansas City two weeks ago in
forming him that during his absence she
haxS been smitten with love for another
whom the intended to marry In a ttw
<5ays. Instead of weeping and decrying hi*
hard luck Coleman showed he was a man
of action.
Packing up a few necessaries he made
a hurried visit to the bank to draw the
few dollars he had been able to save from
his small v.agcf and without waiting to
eecunp leave of absence started Cast on
the first train.
Arriving in Kansas City he found that
his lady love had flown. The girl's father
end mother looked with disfavor on the
putt of the new lover and refused -to give
the parental blessing, having in their
minds their daughter's previous tuigace
ment to the boy in' blue. The couple.
therefore, determined to wed without
their consent and Hoped.
With tears in their eyes the girl's par
ents to!<3 this story to the soldier. Travel
Ftained^ tired and disappointed as he was
the new* proved almost too much. But
only for a few moments. Learning that
the couple had left but a few hours be
fore his arrival he started in pursuit. Thp
fickle jade with her prospective husband,
he was told at the depot, had left on
the train bound for Newton, la. Half
fin *HÂ»nr later Coleman was traveling
r.orth on a freight, n" passenger tram
being scheduled to leave for some hour*.
The determined soldier-lover reached
Newton three hours behind the eloping
couple, Fortune favored him at last fo.-
It required some time to procure a license
and make arrangements for the wedding.
The bride-to-be had been Wt at the
hotel while the expectant groom went
forth to complete the details and this
proved his undoing. During his absence
Coleman arrived on the scene. Face o
face In the parlor of the little hotel he
met the girl who had tried to jilt him.
The shock of seeing the man to whom
she had plighted her troth two years be
fore and whom she imagined to be thou
sands of mile* away recalled to her mint!
her tearful farf-wells and oft-repeatâ¬<3
promises to be true. Badly as he had
been treated the soldier had naught but
love In his heart for the girl. Tears and
excuses for her conduct melted the slight
feeling of anger that possessed him, but
he would not trust her again.
"Marry me and I will forgive every*
thing," he paid, and the girl consented.
Back to Kansas City they went, leaving
the other fellow still attending to pre
liminaries. V
Great was the joy in the girl's home
when she returned and the parents speed
ily gave their consent to the wedding,
wh'ch took place within an hour after
their arrival.
The soldier's next thought was hi6 ca
rer In the army. He had left San "Fran
cisco without the consent of his com
mending officer and unless he reportC'l
at an army post within ten days would
be branded as a deserter. Six of the
ten days had already elapsed and to pre
vent this disgrace he had to hasten. The
nearest army post was at Fort Leaven
worth and he left his bride m the care of
her parents while he proceeded to the
post, arriving there nine days after leav
ing San Francisco and U is presumed
that his story will lighten the penalty
for his offense against military laws.
â¢ Henry Kersten, the 12-year-old witness
in the case of William Schopplein, the boy
charged with the murder of James BriÂ«
zalari at Green and Kearny streets Sep
tember'3D, Is fo/tunate In not being older,
otherwise Judge Conlan would have or
ciered -him into custody yesterday on a
charge of perjury. Kerstun admitted that
parts of his evidence at the Coroner's In
quest were correct and other parts were
wrong. He did not shout to the boys.,
"Look out, he is going to shoot!" but only
shouted "Hey!" meaning for them to look
out. Then" he said he heard two shots,
and when cross-examined said he Â»only
heard one shot. The Judge told him if he
had been a little older he would have sent
him to Jail for perjury.
Bernardlnl Dalmazzo contradicted Ker
sten in several particulars. He said Ker
sten called to. the boys, '"Hey, look out!"
He heard two shots, but did not know
who fired them. Then he said Schopplein
fired them. He fired one at a target on a
cellar door, the witness said. The gun
was loaded when Schopplein got It from
KerBten. After Schopplein fired at; the
target he gave the gun back to Kersten
and walked across the street. Kersten
loaded the gun and Schopplein came back
and got it again from Kersten. Schop
plein had the gun pointed down the hill
when It went off. He was holding the gun
bv his side.
Detective Ed Gibson testified to arrest-
Ing Schopplein, who told him that the gun
went o!T accidentally, and he did not know
that Brizzalari was shot till an hour and
a half afterward.
The defendant testified that he wa3
holding the gun in his hands when It
went off accidentally. He walked away
and did not know that Brizzalari waa
shot till about an hour and a half later.
He had no quarrel with Brizzalari and
nad no motive for shooting him.
Several witnesses were examined as to
the defendant's character, and they all
testified that It was good. Policeman H.
S. Hutchlngs and two other â¢ witnesses
were called In rebuttal, and they testified
that It was bad.
Aftpr hearing Attorney Oevoto -for the
prosecution and Attorneys Castelhun and
Treadwell for the defense the Judge said
he would rescive his decision till to-mor
