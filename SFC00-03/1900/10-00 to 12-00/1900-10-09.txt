When Mr. Bryan arrived at 8:15 the
Roosevelt train had i.ot reached the city
and as a consequence many who came to
hear him went to greet Mr. Bryan. The
people rushed after the Bryan car as it
"East S^. Louis afforded a unique spec
taclec when the Bryan train arrived.
There was no general Information in that
city concerning the time that Mr. Bryan
was to reach there, but the announce
ment had been made that Governor
Roosevelt would speak there at 8 o'clock.

-Mr.' Bryan made no reference to these
remarks, and when he had concluded the
dismantling process sufficiently to ansv/er
.his pprpose he went on with his speech.
Speaking of the Republican contention of
good, times, Mr. Bryan said:'.
Mr. Bryan did, not, however, comply
with this request. He had scarcely begun
speaking when he found that the bunting
and flags on the stand cut off his view of
the audience. He promptly tore down the
obstruction. This act was variously re
garded. Some one cried, "Don't tear
down, the flag," others "Tear It down; It is
where it ought to be taken down."
Mr.'rBryan. spoke with his hat on. and
some one yelled,' "Take off your hat, like
Teddy did."

mass that'e^xtendedso far out that it was
impossible for those* on the outskirts to

ST. LOUIS. Oct. 8.â At Alton Mr. Bryan
spoke to thousands ; of people. His audi

sembled In . this city. The local Demo
cratic leaders, among whom was . Con
gressman Jett. occupied seats on a plat
form erected In front of the courthouse,
At Percy. Mr. Bryan spoke for ten min
utes-from a platform erected near the
train.- There were also short speeches at
Red Bud and Waterloo. A flambeau club
met Mr. Bryan at. Waterloo and escorted
him to the stand .'erected for his accom

Jonesboro was the next stop, and Mr.

and a half ho.ur's stop made. Mr. Bryan
Â¦was taken to the Courthouse yard, where
there was gathered a large and enthusi

farmers. His remarks were directed more
to the laboring man than his other
speeches of the day. He said:
"The people here may be 'divided- into

ernor Roosevelt to-night conclud
ed bis campaign tour of Illinois,
speaking in this city to the larg
est audience assembled here since
the McKinley-Bryan campaign of four
years ago. Various Republican organiza
tions of this city and St. Louis vied with
each other In doing honors to the Vice
Presidential candidate. Governor Roose
velt betrayed no sign of weariness, not
trithsta-nding he had made many speeches
in the Btate en route, the most notable
cf which was at Springfield. There the
Governor refrained from discussing
linance, trusts and Â»uch topics, devoting
himself exclusively to the life and
achievements of Abraham Lincoln, of
whom he said:
"He sacrificed himself In death that his ,
pecple should kr.ow not only liberty but

and hurriedly returned to his train.
On arrival at Alton the Governor was
irrr-tted by a large body of citizens and
â¢r^-nizatior.s bearing flambeaus. A fea
ture was the presence of sixty marines [
ind U-irty former members of the regular
army, all of the latter having served un
ier Roosevelt at Santiago.
Proceeding thence to this city Governor
Roosevelt made a short speech, and im
mediately couth of the city his train was
stepped lor orders. An incident of inter
est occurred at this point. It was the ar
rival and stopping of Mr. Bryan"s train
northbound immediately alongside the
Roosevelt special. The Roosevelt special
arrived here at 11 o'clock, three hours be
hind time, and the Governor was driven
immediately to the platform erected in
front of the Courthouse, from which he
(poke. Apparently the entire city had
turned out to see and cheer the candi
dates. The Governor's speech was brief,
av.lrjg to the lateness of the hour, and was
in tart as follows:
"I see before me here men who served
in the navy and in the regular army near
me or under my personal command on the
battle field at Santiago. Here are brothers
l:.<J tons who were in the army that you
iiave been told to be afraid of. These
brothers and sons who fought to uphold
the honor of <the flag are coheirs in all the
honor that flag can shelter.
"They are coheirs, too, in all the shame
of failure. You, too, are the heirs of the
men who fought under Grant and upheld
the .arms of Lincoln. We hold our heads
high because of what those men did. Are j
you not going to leave to your children I
in their turn a heritage of honor? We
must do our share of the work of the
great world powers. If we filch from the
ta^k we shall show that our loyalty to the
mighty men who were equal to the mighty
task is a loyalty of the lips and .not a loy
alty of heart or deed. Remember the con
ditions cf the Coxey armies and the free
Bouphouses of six years ago.
"Think how ever}- prophecy made by our
opponents four j-ea.rs ago has been falsl-
Jied by the events. Then look around at
your own prosperity. Remember how the
trlasstiowers in this very town have had
a raise of 15 per cent in their wages and
that there Is twice as much employment
as there was four years ago. And with all
this in mind you cannot but realize that it
is for jour material Interest to keep un
changed the policies of President McKin
loy and that it would be folly unworthy of
a serious people to trust yourselves to the
exploded fallacies of our antagonist.
'â¢\Ve have a right to appeal to you on
more than- one ground. It often happens
that different issues will be In seeming
conflict with one another, but In this con
tent we have the right to challenge your
support of every issue raised in the cam
paign. If a man has' to choose between
wealth and honor, of course he should
choree honor, but as a nation we should
stand both for material prosperity and
for honor and renown abroad. We have
the right to appeal to you from the stand
point of your material well-being and ask
you to leave well enough alone: to ask
you to remember the prophecies of Mr.
Bryan four y^ars ago and compare them
v.ith the actual facts and then to make
up your mind if you can afford to trust
any further tfie prophecies of the Bryan
57.cd Democracy of the present day. In
the old days false prophets had a hard
time; at present they are nominated for
the Presidency by the Democracy. Now

BRYAN HESOBTS TO ABTTSB.
Declares Republicans Will Buy Votes
and Coerce Voters.
ST. LOUIS. Oct. 8.â That particular por
tion of Illinois known as "Egypt" was
pretty thoroughly canvassed by William
J. Bryan to-day. The principal cities of
eleven southern counties of the State and
three of the Congressional districts were
visited, and large audiences addressed at
the various stopping places. Fourteen ad
dresses were made from 7 o'clock In the
morning, when the first speech at Salem
was delivered, until the train bearing Mr.
Bryan and his party pulled out of Alton
at nearly midnight. The addresses have
ranged from ten minutes to an hour in
length, and six hours would be a con
servative estimate of the amount of time
consumed by Mr. Bryan in actual talk.
Southern Illinois was intensely enthu-
Eiastlc. At every meeting the candidate
was greeted with hearty demonstrations
of affection, and his remarks were ap
plauded and cheered everywhere. At one
place there was a disposition on the part
of a few boys to cheer his opponent, but
there were no attempts to Interfere with
his remarks being heard.
W. J.- Bryan began to-day's work with
a speech in Salem, 111., his birthplace, and
was given a warm reception. He talked
about an hour near the Courthouse in
wTilch his father held court from 1SG0 to
1S72, and where he himself made his first
political speech twenty years ago. Mr.
Bryan was introduced by Judge William
Prentiss of Chicago, and among other
things said:
"If the election were held to-day there
is no doubt we would have a majority in
the electoral college and on the popular
vote. But the Republican managers are
now collecting from the monopolies a
large campaign fund. They will b/iy
every vote that can be bought. They will
coerce every vote that can be coerced.
They will intimidate every laboring man
who can be intimidated; they will bribe
every election judge that can be bribed.
They will corrupt every count that can be
corrupted. I don't understand how It Is
possible for the plain, everyday Republi
can to close his eyes to what is going on,
when he knows that if he aids these in
fluences to carry the election at this? time
the same means can be employed to car
ry other elections when those Â¦who are
j supporting the Republican ticket to-day
| will be opposed to the Republican ticket."
The south of Egypt was well represent
! ed in Cairo when Bryan arrived there at
j 10:15 o'clock. There had been excursions
from the neighboring towns and villages,
i and the result was a large crowd to wel
' come the Democratic nominee. He was
driven to a stand erected near the center
â¢ of the city. His speech was devoted
I mainly to trusts, although the question
j of a large standing army and the qucs
: tlon of Imperialism each received some
; attention at his hands. Among other
thine? he said:
"The Republican party has not fulfilled
its promises. It will riot do anything of
i permanent and lasting advantage to the
] great majority of the people, and the rea
foii is that it la to-day controlled, guided
I and directed by organized combined
! wealth, and combined wealth demands
j not equal rights but special privileges.
J and every privilege granted by law to
I these great combinations Is taken from
' the people. Whenever you find that a
few people by operation of law are gain-
Ing an advantage, you may rest assured
that that advantage is coming from some
body. The trouble is that the Govern
j ment gathers a little from each person
and dumps the wholcamount Into the laps
of a few, and the few receive it in large
amounts and you see the evidence of their"
prosperity, while the little is collected
from each one and the Republican' party
is forgetting the man from whom it col
lects while it takes care of the man who
receives. All over this land are the homes
of forgotten men, men whose rights are
disregarded, men whose interests are neg
lected because of the demands made by
combined capital. We are not enemies of
honestly acquired wealth. No one who
wants to eat the bread that he earns and
to earn the bread that he eats need be
afraid of the success of our ticket The
only man who needs to fear Is the man
who wants to eat the bread that some
body else earns and wants to eat it with
out paying for it.

CHICAGO. Oct. S.â In a letter to Miss
E. Ward of the "Women's Presbyterian
Board of Missions Mrs. L. B. Neal, a mis
sionary, says that the Boxer uprising in
China has wrought irreparable injury to
ir.issionary work in China. The writer
says:
"Can you imagine Peking now. and
Tungchow, and Paoting-Fu? All those

them assaulted. Manchuria, Chill and
Shantung are already swept clean of all
missionaries and the first two of all large
mission stations, while the whole Interior

every description. The sufferings of those

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Oct. 8.
There is grave danger of the gen
eral negotiations with China be
ing checked as a result of the re
fusal of the Emperor to return to Peking.
His decision, or rather that of the Em
press Dowager, will not affect the pur
pose of tha United States to initiate ne
gotiations, but there ! are other powers
which are inclined to make hla return an
essential condition to negotiations. "With
him at Peking it Is the belief of diplo
mats here that there would be no delay
in effecting a satisfactory settlement, but
with him absent there will be a disposition
to pick flaws in credentials of the Chi
nese negotiators and there will be inter
minable delays. In the interest of early
peace, therefore, it Is believed to be high
ly desirable that he should at once pro
ceed to his capital, but the Emperor is
unable to do so, and the Empress Dow
ager has no intention of permitting him
to return when she Is not even invited to
accompany him.
Notwithstanding the urgent representa
tions made by this Government through
Minister Wu and of the British Govern
ment through the Chinese Minister sta
tioned in London, the Imperial Govern
ment has moved Its capital further in
land. The news of this movement is con
tained in an imperial decree handed by
Minister Wu to Secretary Hay to-day.
This Government will not further re
duce Its force In Peking, the 13C0 men un
der orders to remain constituting the le
gation guard. The Russian Government,
which was first to announce that its lega
tion and troops would proceed to Tientsin,
has retained in the capital a strong force
to offset the troops stationed there by
Germany, Japan and Great Britain. Rus
sia is undoubtedly willing to withdraw all
her forces provided the other nations do
so, and Baron Nlshi, the Japanese Min
ister, has recommended a substantial re
duction in the Japanese force.
But the German troops ate steadily re
ceiving reinforcements and have given
unmistakable Indication of their Inten
tion to winter at Peking. It is unlikely,
therefore, that the appeal of the Emperor
for the withdrawal of foreign troops will
be heeded.
While the Chinese Government has de
clined to accede to the request of the
powers to resume its seat in Peking It is
continuing its policy of punishing the re-

Gardiner mad? a statement to-day con
cerninp the work done by his office to
solve th? mystery surrounding the death
oJ William R. Rice and thq checks with
his name attached.
"This matter." said the District Attor
ney, "was first brought to my attention
by the banking house of Swenson & Sons
through their counsel. Mr. Gerard. From
the information received from Mr. Gerard
it appeared that Patrick had presented a
cheek for J25.000, knowing Mr. Rice to be
dead and concealed the fact from the
banking: houso. and when they tried to
communicate with Mr. Rice owinp to the
ptisplcionB aroused by the check itself,
they were met by evasive answers over
the telephone by the valet, who at nrst
concealed the fact of the death of Mr.
Rice. Then they made further inquiries
and ascertaineo that the body had been
promptly embalmed with arsenoua fluid,
though Mr. nice had in his lifetime said
he was opposed to anythinp of that sort
and the funeral was boing hastened with
Intent to cremate the body. The situation
seemed to be one which required prompt
action and the detective lorce was Ira
mediately communicated with bv tele
phone and Mr. Gerard was Fent"for to
Pive all necessary information Coroner
Hart was called into the case and re
quested to prevent the funeral. Mean
while the brother of the deceased was
hastening from Texas.
"Last week Patrick called upon me with
his private counsel. Assistant District At
torney IiikÂ« was also present and the
conference lasred nearly an hour. In that
time Patrick's attention was called to a
number of very puspicious circumstances
particularly a? to the embalming of the
body with nrsenous fluid when it was
about to be cremated. He pave no exnla
nation of this, but admitted that a!l or
nearly all of Mr. Rice's property had been
a^lpned to him. The object of such as
sipnment he did not disclose.
"The question asked seem to cause him

ceptibly. which was noticed by both Mr

"I have seen a number of checks of Mr

nature, as it empowers him to put up at
public auction evcrythinK In the- shape of
a mining claim or mining prospect not
otherwise owned than by the Govern
ment, and If such property Is not sold at
the regular monthly auction day in No
vember, which is the 2d of that month,
it will all be open to location by duly ac
credited miners having regularly issued
licenses. In this list will be included
those claims and fractions on Bonanza
El Dorado and Hunker creeks which were
advertised some months ago to be sold
at auction, but which were withdrawn
Just before the day of sale. It is not
probable that the last batch" of claims
and fractions mentioned will be offered
at the October sale or until November
While It Is not yet possible for Mr. Bell
nor any of the employes of the Golil
Commissioner's pfflce to arrive at anv
thlng- like an accurate conclusion as "to
the number of claims which Â¦ the new

tary of State. He was sitting by the mid
dle window, a gun in his hand. I had
just entered the room. I had seen some
armed men in the hall and they s-aid there
was trouble In the Legislature. Later in
the day I saw him in Caleb Powers* pri
vate office with a gun, sitting by the win
dow. The window was raised a little and
the curtain pulled down. I asked him
what he was doing with 1,he gun. He
gaid: 'There Is trouble up there.* pointing
to the legislative building. 'I do not In
tend to start any trouble, but if it startd
I will be prepared for it.' He pulled back
a long board standing against the wail,
disclosing some guns, and said to me:
"They aay Powers Is a brave man. but
when there are signs of trouble he hides
his guns.'
"After that Powers himself came in and
Youtsey again said . he would not start
anything, but was prepared for trouble.
I told him he ought not to think of shoot
inE- out of a window and Youtsey said.
â¢Oh, that's all right. It will never be
done.' I left Powers and Toutsey In there
when I came out. I saw Youtaey again
Monday morning before Goebel was shot.
He was out in the main hall near the west
door of the legislative building. Caleb
Powers was present and Youtsey asked
me If we had any chance to win the con
test. When I told him the attorneys wer,e
hopeful he seemed satisfied and walked
toward his office. I was in my office
next to the Governor's when the shot
was fired. Some one said a man was
shot. I looked out and saw a man lying
on the pavement with Colonel Jack Chlnn
near him.
"When I went Into Powers private
office the day Youtsey was in there the
door was locked and I knocked to get in.
About ten minutes after the shooting I
saw Youtsey in my office, which is the
reception-room to the Governor's office.
I heard him say nothing and saw him
have no arms."
Tedd was not cross-examined by the
defense.
Frank H. Johnson, who â¢was Deputy
State Auditor in January, said he had a
conversation with Youtsey prior to Janu
ary 30, and while he recalled the talk
rather indistinctly he remembered that
Youtsey said something about feeling ag
grieved at Senator Goebel over some mat
ter about which he said Goebel had mis
treated him. â¢
The defense declined to cross-examine
Johnson, who was afterward recalled by
the prosecution and said that after the
shooting he called up all the clerks in
the Auditor's office and asked them their
exact whereabouts at the time of the
shooting; that when he asked Youtsey
where he was Youtsey said: "I was in a.
safe place."
Witness said a week or ten days later
he asked Youtsey again where he .was
when the shot was fired and he told him
that he was in the basement of the ex
ecutive building.
Ed Steffle, the telegraph, messenger,
said he saw a gun barrel sticking out of
Powers' office window a second or two
after the shot was fired. The gun wad
withdrawn a second later.
Ed Porter Thompson Jr., who was op
posite the east entrance to the executive
building when the shots were flred. ?aid
a minute after the shooting he saw Yout
sey run around the executive building
from the basement entrance and up the
steps and go In the east entrance.
J *B. Mathews. Assistant Secretary of
State under Powers, said Youtsey came
into his office about a minute after the
shooting with a pistol in his hand. Somo
ten minutes after the shootine Mathews
broke open the transom and climbed into
Powers' office, where he saw a rifle lving
on the floor near the west front window.
another leaning against the wall and a
carbine In the southeast corner next to
the bookcase. He said that after Yout
sey was arrested he told him that he
knew the front window of Powers' office
was not raised, but was bolted down, on
January 30.
Wade Watts and Louis Smith, keepers
of the toilet room in the basement, told
of seeing Youtsey run through their room
a few seconds after the shooting. Court
adjourned until to-morrow.

ANTI-WHITE
PARTY MAY WIN
OUT IN HAWAII
It has been generally understood that
Prince David would be the candidate fcr
delegate to Congress on the Democratic
ticket. The candidate on the Independent
or anti-white party, as already an
nounced, will be R. w. "Wilcox, the leader
of the movement, a half-white and fully
Identified with the native element. He
ha3 recently made a tour of the islands
for the purpose of exciting an anti-white
sentiment, with the avowed object of
gaining control of the Legislature. The
Republican candidate for Congress will
undoubtedly be Samuel Parker, a half
white native. Many signs point to the
election of Wilcox.
There are some signs of a lack of har
mony in the Republican ranks over local
Issues. Up to the present time there has
been no municipal government In Hono
lulu or in any towns of the great island,
all local affairs having been conducted
by the goneral Government. Many who
have become residents of the islands sinco
annexation are clamoring for local muni
cipal governments, while the Kamaalnas,
or old residents, are firmly opposed to
such a departure, believing that the gov
ernment can be more economically ad
ministered as at present.
HONOLULU, Sept. 23.-The native Ha
wallans are showing much Interest in the
approaching election of a delegate to Con
gress and are registering rapidly and in
great numbers. Out of 2700 voters regis
tered on the island of Oahu. on which
this city Is situated, nearly 2000 -are Ha
waiians. This Interest is very likely pro
duced by the report which has been cir
culated among them that If they can suc
ceed In electing a delegate to the Ameri
can Congress the annexation bill will be
repealed and the Queen restored to thÂ«
throne. The better educated of the na
tives have identified themselves with
either the Republican or Democratic
fiarty In the Islands, but large numbers
ed by R. w. Wilcox are Insisting upon
an Independent organization. It la
claimed that if these Independent votera
succeed In preserving their organization
and work together at the election they
will swamp the party organizations. But
the native Hawaiian is not as a rule an
astute politician and is easily led by the
strong leaders. It Is extremely doubtful
If any independent organization among
them will prove successful and It Is quite
likely that many will coalesce with one
or the other of the regular party organ
izations.

SPEECH OF GRANT
WAS MISUNDERSTOOD
Did Not Mean to Say the Negroes Were Con

Men to Remain.
INDIANAPOLIS. Oct. S.â Bishop A.
Grant of the A. M. E. Church, refer
ring to the remarks credited to him.
while at the conference at Oxford,
Ohio, In which he is quoted as saylnc.
among other things, that "the negroes
were considering the question whether
they would allow the white man to re
main in this country or not," said to-day:
"That such an interpretation has been
placed on my remarks at Oxford is truly
surprising. "What I said, and the thought
I meant to convey was. that I was In
Africa last year and saw my own con
dition and what I was S00 years ago.
And, whatever the process of develop
ment had been, I would not discuss It
and had no complaint to make. I said
the American negro is the biggest negro
in the world to-day and there was no
use in his standing arouod asking what
the white man was going to do with him.
but he should ask the question, 'What are
we going to do with ourselves?* 1 said
that we had reached the place, after be
ing here nearly 300 years, where we had
as much right to consider what we should
do with the white man as he had to con
sider what he would do with us. The fact
is that I took the cptlmistic view of our
future In the United States."

CHICAGO. Oct. 8.â F. W. Wayland. as
eistant manager of the Mooney & Boland
detective acency. was arrested on his re
turn frora Virginia to-day and charged
with complicity in the alleged plot to de
fraud the New York Life Insurance Com
pany, the Canadian Order of Foresters
and The Kr.ipht*. and Ladies of Honor, in
which Mips Marie Defenbach became In
sured for $12,000 shortly brfore her death,
which occurred suddenly or. August 23
last. Dr. August M. Vnper an.l Frank H.
Smiley, a detective, were arrested on the
fame charge yesterday.
It is believed that Miss Defenbach was
oripinally one of the conspirators, and
that she thought her death was to be
feigned and another body palmed oft as
hers. On August "1 Miss Defersbach called
at the office cf a lawyer in the Unity
building named Johr.son and tol<J him phe
wanted to make her will. Some days
rarlior. it is stated. Dr. Urgcr had told
this lawyer a woman would call on him
for this purpose, and she announced she
had come in accordance with the appoint
ment. She told Mr. Johnpon she Â¦wanted
to leavp her property to Frank H. Smiley.
her affianced, and then she went away.
Two days afterward she returned and
Mr. Johnson had the will ready. It pro
vided, as Fhe haxl instructed, that after
her debts were paid her property was to
FO to Smllpy. but she then wanted another
provision Inserted. It was that after her
death h*>r body be cremated- This sur
prised Mr. Johnson, but he complied with
the request. He was 50 .struck with the
circumstar.ee, however, as the cremation
clause had not been in the oripinal in
structions, that he railed in witnesses to
the xvjil frnm adjoirfnp offices as a matter
of protection. r.Iiss Defenbach then
Fipr.od th'* document. Two days later she
died in great Sgony. Hrr body was hur
riedly embalmed and then cremated. A
rornr.fr'? jury rendered the verdict that
denth Â¦was caused by dysentery.
Frank H. Smiley, the detective of the
Mooney & Roland apency. who also was
arrost^ii to-day, has made n full written
ron*escrioT5 nf h:f= part in the crime. The
ronTtfSslonJ if true, implicates -with him
l>r. August M. Unper and Frank Way
land Urown. assistant mcr.aper of the
Mooney & Roland agency, the other two
men ur.cier arrest.
Â¦\Vhf-n the case g-oes on trial Smiley, it is
nrcnour.ced. will turn State's evidence.
State'* Attorney Dineen expects that all
three n> n vi'.l bfÂ» convicted of conspiracy
Â¦to defraud the Xevr York Life Insurance
O"ixiriÂ»r,y and the two benevolent orders,
the <."r.raf'.inn Order of Foresters and the
Kr.iphts arid Ladies of Honor, but It Is
very doubtful whether any charjre of mur
der can pvm be formally made on the
evidence availaiile.
At least, one rther man connected with
the Mooney & Boland agency is now un
der surveillano for su?vicious actions at
the time cf Mis? Defenbach's death, and
it is not 5mr,rohabl<? that several other
finfjilrators can yet be connected with
the crime.

YRACUSE. N. Y.. Oct. 8.â In the
(r"j Central New York Methodist
Episcopal Conference to-day, the
4*tM**' committee on temperance pre-
sented a report which condemned
the army canteen and urged the enforce
ment of prohibitive measures.
Bishop McCabe said that it was not al
ways policy to denounce those high In au
thority.
"I believe," he said, "that the Presi
dent wanta to do what la right. He is ono
of the best, one of the purest and one of
the bravest men I ever knew."
The bishop's remarks provoked great
Lpplause, but one of the members took
exception. The bishop replied that ho was
a man bofore he was a bishop and would
ceare to be a bishop before he will ceasa
to be a man. In a political campaign, he
raid, the President of the United States
ought not to be abused.
The Rev, A. B. Leonard of New York,
general missionary secretary, spoko at
length on missions. He said that not a
Methodist missionary had lost^ his life
in China, but that the property loss of
the denomination has been heavy.

- PACIFIC GROVE, Oct. 8.â Dr. Gordon
B. Hamilton, son of Right Rev. John Â¦ W.
Hamilton, the new Methodist Episcopal
Bishop of California, delivered an address
In the Methodist Episcopal church In this
city last night on "Fellowship In Christian
Service," !n which he made a pleaÂ»for the
negroes of the Southern States as well as
for the races thnt have become a part of
tho American people as a result of . Ihe
recent Spaoish-Amerlcan war. He ap
pealed for both as to their education and
moral and civil development.
The address was especially notable be
cause of the fact that before his election
to the episcopacy Bishop Hamilton had
entire charge of the Freedman's Aid and
Southern education branch of Methodist
work in America. The opinions and argu
ments advanced by his son come, there
fore, with more force and authority.
A large audience was In attendance, and
at the close of the address a considerable
amount of money was donated to carry
on the work of which Dr. Hamilton
spoke.

It was "acclamation day," each of tha

Every prophecy made by those claiming:
to know whereof they spoke was dashed
to the ground, with the exception of Syn
der for Mayor and Hance for City Clerk.
There was nothing of an excitinsr na
ture duiinc the proceedings outside of
amendments offered to the platform com
mittee's report. Frank Allender, Demo
cratic nominee for tho Assembly from tho
Seventy-fifth District, thought It would
be a "vote catcher" to present a resolu

ing the striking electrical linemen plenty
of sympathy in their efforts to obtain a
"fair day's pay for a fair day's work."
The leaders could not see It that way and
promptly sat down on Allender. Chair
man Le Compte Davis declared the reso
lution out of order, and Allender appealed
from this decision. Chairman Davis was
sustained and Allender crushed.

As.salt water now reaches solid ice Windom glacier will once more go" on
producing bergs and become a "live" glacier. ( GarsidÂ« says these changes oc
curred late in September. ; Fishermen lh the neighborhood at the time were
greatly frightened, and reported that the entire glacier bad slipped- into the
sea.
From every Indication it would Eeem that the river which runs under the
glacier became dammed or blocked and a great volume of water gradually
backed up the mountain side beneath the huge mass of ice until it exerted
such a tremendous pressure that it actually forced its way to the sea. "When
It did so It tore away a section of the glacier about a half-mile In length along
the glacial front, 200 to 300 feet wide and 500 feet deep. It forced this -ice
through a solid moraine, cutting a deep channel, through which the river now
runs without hindrance.
TACOMA. Oct. 8.â Surveyor G.W. Garslde brings to Juneau news of start
ling changes in the face of Windom Glacier, at Taku Inlet. This glacier was
"dead"' and its terminal moraine extended in a great crescent shaped bar Into
the channel. Big trees grew on a portion of the bar and sub-glacial drainage
went on thro.ugh several small creeks or rivers. At present an enormous
section of the south end of the glacier is floating about in huge bergs in Taku
or has melted, and a deep channel 300 feet wide has been cut through the'bar
to tidewater. The sea now reaches glacial ice again, after possibly 200 years
or more, judging from the age of the trees. . .

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 8.-The City Council
by a unanimous vote recently adopted a
resolution to offer $600,000 for the two city
water pipe plants and the entire water
system and water rights of the San Diego
Company. Mayor Capps announced
in an interview to-day that he would veto
the ordinance for the reason that it con
tained three propositions which, to be
legal, should be in separate ordinances.
He also objects to the clause agreeing to
buy. all water needed by the city for five
years from one company for 4 cents per
thousand gallons, because It does not state
when the water ls to be delivered nor un
der what pressure It is to be maintained.
The Council probably will alter the ordi

break the will of Mrs. Maria L. Shimmins
and In which grave charges are
made against Attorney E. D. Saw
yer of San Francisco was filed
to-t'ay In the office of the County
Clerk. The allegations in the complaint
are identical with those published exclu
sively in The Call yesterday. Attorneys
James H. Creely and Archie Borland are
retained by the alleged heirs, and the con
te Â£Â£. Promises to be exceptionally bitter.
The alleged heirs are Ellen Oaborn, a
sister of deceased, and Ellen Stuberfleld.
Eg-bert H. and Albert H. Housman,
Martha Griffith and Caroline Decker;
children of another sister of the deceased.

by Attorney E. D. Sawyer of San Fran

mission of the will to probate on the 27th
or. the same month and the issuance of
letters of administration to Sawyer, the
contestants ask that the probate of the
will be set aside. They allege that the
signing of the testament was procured by
undue Influence. For thirty years Saw
yer was attorney for the deceased, and
Joseph Madena-s. the other legatee, and a
confidential employe of the old lady had
resided on the ranch for sixteen years It
is alleged that through their intimate ac

over Mrs. Shimmins and forced her to
sign the will. The claim is set up that
Sawyer and Madenas told her that her
sister was dead and that her other rela

poisoned her mind against her relatives.
According to the contestants, the old
lady was importuned to execute the will

would make public to the detriment of her

feet were on the floor and his knees
nearly touched it. Had he changed his

Thinkers and travelers say he will not if

condition now than he ever was, with
continued promise of good times in the
shadow of the G. O. P. bandwagon. Every
interest, especially here on the ; Pacillc
Coast, cries our to the careful man not
to hesitate, but to keep onâ as he has berni
doingâ prosperinp.
"\V. H. .Mills, who has recently returned
from the Paris Exposition, gives some of
the most potent reasons why residents in
Pacific Coast Statfs should swell McKln
ley's majority In November, as they did
four years ago. He bases these reasons
not only upon the general distrust of
Bryan, but upon his knowledge of com
mercial and industrial conditions on this
part of the map. In an Interview with a
reporter for The Call Mr. Mills stated
these reasons. He said:
"The present administration found the coun
try !n a state of prostration. At the end of four
years we find a condition of the greatest pos-
Fible prosperity. That this is a fact is un
derstood throughout the world. The Un'.ted
States is known as the most prosperous nation
In the Â¦world.
"The difficulty with any fiscal policy adopted
by the Congress of the United States has been
that It Is never maintained a sufficient length
ot time to determine by experiment its wis
dom. As I passed through the Southern States
last February, en my way to New York, I saw
evidences of the rising prosperity of those
States. We produced in the year 1S99 11.000,
000 bales of cotton. The market value of this
cotton on the basis of the present price Is
about J2CO.CC0.C0O. If that flbor was worked In
to fabric It would be worth $12,000,000,000. The
question is, where fhall this wealth be cre
ated? By the industry of operatives and the
association of great capital here, or In some
foreign country? Shall we pay freight on this
cctton fiber and haye It returned in the form
of cotton fabric, so that the consumer will find
it charged with the frieght both ways?
Silent Democracy.
'"The Democratic party is silent, practically,
on this question. Mr. Bryan, who Is a free
tiade man and who combines In his following
the free-trade elements of the country, did
not dare to challenge the marked effects of
the Ding-ley bill; but the election of Mr. Bryan
will be the practical repeal of the Dingley
bill, because If the people who favor free trade
are to get control of the Government the pro
visions of the Dingley bill are menaced. In
vestors of capital in manufactures will find
such Investments extra hazardous under those
circumstances, and the distrust occasioned by
the defeat of McKinley will be In all re
spects the equivalent of a reversal rf the pol
icy underlying the Dingley bill. It is the lia
bility of a change of administration at the
end of each four years which constitutes in it
self a menace to the stability of governmental
pclicies. which makes the Investment of capi
tal In enterprises very risky Indeed. It is use
less for the Democrats to contend that no re
form or modification of the present tariff laws
U Intended. The very fact that the party
which secured the Dingley bill is defeated at
the polls will operate to repeal the most salu
tary effects of the present fiscal policy, without
repealing the law, so that the provisions of the
Dingley bill are In Issue. In very truth, the
deliberate of the Congress of the
United States, from the standpoint of exist
ing conditions, ought to be maintained long
enough to furnish the only scientific basis ot
determinationâ that of experiment. If the pres
ent tariff law Is urging the country toward a
condition of inflation, which will eventually
picduce a condition of great depression, we
will have a precedent by which we may be
guided in the future. But tariff laws should
be modified, not radically changed, and if the
present policy of the country should be con
tinued for twenty years it would not be too
long to furnish standards of judgment as to
the effect of a high protective system*" â "
Pacific States' Interest.
"The Paciflc States have a peculiar Interest
In the present Presidential campaign. The Pa
ciflc Coast Is practically the most remote por
tion of the world. You acquire a realization of
this when you are on the other side of the
ocean. The very appearance of the map
shows you that the two American continents
ttretch almost from the north to the south
pole. California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon and
Washington are a group of Paciflc States
whose commerce by the ocean is served only
by the longest lines of transportation made for
oi-mmerclal purposes on the face of the globe.
The true, real and substantial development of
this country will begin when the Pacific ports
arc the front and open door to an independ
ent commercial system. Our provincialism
will pass an soon as the ocean becomes a
prime and leading factor In. our development.
"If we retain the Philippines snd by systems
of education, by respect for the rights of. the
people, by conferring upon them stability ot
government and all the modern Institutions
of religious and civil liberty we will make
them fit for self-government and they have
the right to this service at our hands. Mr.
Bryan appears to think that they are already
qualified to enter upon the conduct of a gov
ernment of their own. Well, If they are fit
to be a nation they are fit to be members of
this great republic. .If Mr. Bryan's benevolent
intentions concerning them are practicable he
can proceed to the accomplishment of his pur
poses only on the theory that theae people
are fit to govern themielves and If they are
fit to govern themselves they are fit to ex
ercise state sovereignty as a family | in the
American Union. You have not eliminated
them nor their Influence upon the commercial,
Industrial, political and social life of America
by making a nation _ of them. There Is a
greater Intimacy between . the nations : of the
world to-day than there was between the States
of this Union fifty years ago. They, would
exert an Influence upon our people as a mem
ber of the family of nations fully equal ta
that they would exert as a member * of the
family of States. In the former Instance we
would have no control over them and In the
latter Instance we would exert an Influence
with them. Â¦
"The possession of the Hawaiian and the
Philippine Islands l gives us a standing. In tht
Pacific" Ocean absolutely Indispensable to our
supremacy In the great commerce which Is
rising on that, ocean. -When that commerce
rises the States lying west of the Rocky Moun
tains will be ltÂ» chief beneficiaries.
"After fifty years we are confronted with
the opportunity, of having arise on the Pacific
Ocean a great marine commerce with numer
ous lines of fteamsl^s running in and out of
our ports.
: "Great cities are simply the focal centers
of converging and diverging lines of commerce
by land and sea. Wherever ocean transporta
tion- focalizes at a -port land j transportation
meets it with like converging ' and diverging
lines.
The First Consideration.
The foreign policy of Mc-
Klnlay has given the Ameri
can nation a standing- in the
earth which it has never be
fore achieved. It possesses an
influence in the councils of the
nations to-day more potent,
more dignified and more ex
alted from every standpoint of
view than it has ever occupied
before. Every citizen of Amer
ica who has traveled abroad
for the last twenty years real
izes this in a signal way. We
have achieved a national
power which carries with it
the responsibility of exerting
an influence upon the destinies
of mankind. This nation can
not by any possibility avoid
the recognition of the respon
sibility which rests upon it as
ons of the great nations of the
Â¦world. We are living in a time
which will exert an influence
upon all future time. The
great dead sea of human life
in the Orient is to be awaken
ed. New commercial relations
between the western nations
of Europe and the nations
whose countries border on the
Pacific Ocean are about to be
established. The commerce
which will result from this
new relation is vaster than
that of which the world has
had any former experience.
The Pacific Ocean will be thÂ«
theater of a commerce which
will dwarf that of the Atlantic
Ocean, and this will be accom
plished in a very few years. â
W. H. MILLS.
Present Administration Has Shown a Capacity for
Dealing With Great Questions Affecting
the Country's Prosperity.
verge of bankruptcy, a radical change In the
administration of the Government would be
the suggestion of wisdom. We could take no
risk In the way of making: things worse when
we changed from the Democratic administra
tion of Cleveland to the Republican adminis
tration of McKlnley. We Incurred no risk of
making the condition of the country worse. It
was Just as bad as It could be. But at the
summit of the broadest and most beneficent
prosperity which has ever attended the his
tory of the nation, it would be unwise to look
backward, and I do not believe for a moment
that the Amerlcaa people will Incur the hazard
of' change.
The Second Consideration.
"The second consideration is that the foreign
policy of McKinley has given the American
nation a standing In the earth which it haÂ«
never before achieved.' It possesses an Influ
ence in the councils of the nations to-day more
potent, more dignified and more exalted from
every standpoint of view than it has everi oc
cupied before. Every citizen of America who
has traveled abroad for the last twenty years
realizes this In a signal way. We have reached
a time In the history of the world when our
course must be chosen with reference to the
policies of other nations. We have achieved a
national power which carries with It the re
sponsibility of exerting an Influence upon the
destinies of mankind. This nation cannot by
any possibility avoid the recognition of the
responsibility which rests upon it as one of
the great nations of the wftftft. We are living
In a time which will exert an Influence upon
all future time. The great dead sea of hu
man life in the Orient is to be awakened. New
commercial relations between the Western
nations of Europe and the nations whose coun
tries border on the Pacific Ocean are about to
be established. The commerce which will re
sult from this nÂ«w relation Is vaster than that
of which the world has had any former experi-
ence. The Paciflc Ocean will be the theater
of a commerce which will dwarf that of the
Atlantic Ocean, and this will be accomplished
In a very few years.
"For a brief time the American nation has
arisen to the full stature of the other nations
of the world. For a brief time It has recog
nized its responsibilities as a nation. Only
within the past two or three years have we
received at the hands of the nations of the
world that recognition which has In all time
been our due, and this Improved condition of
things Is influencing: favorably our Internal de
velopment. It is having a direct Influence up
on our industries and commerce. The com
mercial relations of the world are being ad-
Justed and we must not be adjusted out of
them. Commerce exists only where great sur
plus products are produced. It- is the surplus
that Is the object of commerce. The natural
resources of America are greater than those of
any other nation. Under favoring laws our
productive capacity has been vastly augmented.
Let the present condition of prosperity continue
another four years and America will be the
most productive country In the world, and it
will produce the largest surplus of any coun
try. This surplus will be worth something or
nothing only If our relations with the rest
of the world are properly cared for by a wise
foreign policy. The present administration
has shown a capacity (or dealing with these
great questions, and there is no portion of the
United States that is so directly, so signally
and so vitally interested in this new foreign
policy as the country lying west of the Rocky
Mountains."

President he will give the Philippines an Inde

"There are two leading considerations which

first Is that when we compare the condition of

not want to hazard the change of existing

Changes should be consented to only in the

Whorever there is a mucous membrane
there- catarrh may exist.
The only reason that catarrh Is more
frequent in the passages of the nose and
throat Is because these passages are more
exposed to cold than the other portions
of the raucous membrane. But one Is lia-
ble to have catarrh of the lungs or kid-
neys or stomach or liver or bowels, and
especially the bladder and other pelvic
cr&ans.
Peruna Is a specific in cases of female
weakness or pelvic catarrh and Is heart-

â¢Â¦â¢Kvery tall and winter of late years I
had a. severe cough and cold which phy-
slclar.s have been unable to cure. This
lsst winter at the advice of a friend I
decided to try Pcruna. Both my friend
and her family had used Peruna with
good results.
-I was more than pleased with what
the medicine <51d for me. and keeo it
always in the house. I also had chronic
catarrh of the head, which made the
slightest cold so much worse. 1 am com-
pletely cured of my catarrh after four
months' faithful use of Peruna. and my
eencral health is greatly improved. I al-
ways speak a good word for Perura."

Catarrh Generally Thought to Be
a Disease of the Head Only.
Catarrh has been so generally thoug-ht
to be a disease confined to the head and
throat that it is very difficult to get many
people to understand that catarrh may
affect any organ of the human body.

DOIN'S IN PINOLE.
Chretien ar.d Ropers were associated in the scheme
to loot the estate of Joseph Sullivan. Chretien's guilt
Has heen brought home to him and he has entered
upon a ten years' sentence to penal servitude. Rogers
still holds his place as a member of the bar. The Bar
Association permits it. ; Can it be that the association
is utterly indifferent to thr practices of its members?
There are among the members of the association law
yers who are esteemed aÂ« exemplars of the highest
standards and best traditions of the American bar, but
they seem willing to associate with practitioners who
are afraid to give evidence in co::n conccrn:nsr their
practices lest it should convict them of crir.:e. Surely
the public has a right to expect better things of men
Â»ho> are desirous of public esteem: it has a ripht to
expect the association to take action to defend the
honor of the California bar. Therefore it demands to
know w hat is to be done in the case of James Taylor
Ropers.
The issue is not for the coarts only. James Tay
lor Rogers continues to hold the privileges of a mem
f>er of the bar. Discredited, disgraced and suspected
or. pood grounds of the grossest offenses of which an
attorney can be g-i:i!ty. he still stands before the pub
lic a< a member of an honorable profession with all
the privileges and rights of the foremost and most
honored man at the lar. Under such circumstances
it is the duty of the Bar Association to take action.
The public looks to the association to uphold the
ethics rnd the Â«iisrn:ty of the California bar. and if it
fail to act in a case so notorious as this the whole pro
fession wiU fa!l under suspicion of conniving at frau
dulent practices, if not actually abettins; them.
When efforts were made to learn from Ropers what
he knew about the conspiracy he declined to answer
questions, alleging as a reason for lv.s refusal that his
answers would incriminate him. If that were not a
confession of guilt, what was it?
All the evidence that has been forthcoming in the
case points to the guilt of Rogers and affords ampl
grouad for n moral conviction that he is at least un
fit to be permitted to practice at the bar. Rogers en
tered the case chiming to represent certain hfirs of
Sullivan. When a motion was made to distribute the
estate to the heir Chretien had brought forward
Rogers objected, but afterward he withdrew the ob
jection and consented to the distribution. He testi
fied in court thai he had neither received nor been
promised money in consideration of withdrawing his
objection. That testimony has been contradicted by
three witne^c?. who have asserted that Roger? was
paid for withdrawing the objection. On that show
ing either Rogers is puslty of perjury or others are,
and the matter should certainly receive the fullest
Â¦judicial investigation.
JOHN M. CHRETIEN ha? been found guilty on
a charge of perjury committed in his scheme to
loot the estate of the late Joseph Sullivan and
has been sentenced to ten years' penal servitude in
San OÂ«c:itin penitentiary. The conviction serves to
nva'l the offense to the public mind and to reawaken
popular interest in the case of James Taylor Rogers,
v.ho was connected with it about as closely as Chre
tien, but who up to this time has managed to escape
any punishment except the imprisonment imposed
upon him for refusing to answer questions.
James Taylor Rogers should not be permitted to
j>a"ss untried for his offenses. If innocent he shouU
have the advantage of proving the fact in court. If
guilty he should be convicted, disbarred and pun
ished.
CHRETIEN AND ROGERS.
These are straightforward words. Whether they
come from a man of German descent or any other de
<ccnt they represent true Americanism. They show
how foolish has been the boasting of the Bryamtes
that they could separate the German element from
other elements of the people and lure them into the
folly of voting for Bryan by any sort of appeals they
might make to them. There may become objection
able features in the policy of the administration, but
were they tenfold worse they would not be so bad as
the evils of Bryanism. On that point all intelligent
men are agreed. The prosperity of the country de
pends upon the election of McKinley, and German-
Americans as well as other Americans tally under
stand the fact.
Following the same lines and drawing the same
conclusions from the same facts, Abram S. Hewitt,
one of the foremost Democrats in New York, ie
cently said: "I do not see how a Democrat who is
title to the interests of Democracy can in the present
exigency take any other course than to vjote for the
Republican ticket. I projxose myself so to vote, and
I do this because I r.m a Democrat who feels that
Bryanism and all that it stands for is diametrically op
posed to the principles of the Democratic party ai
they were enunciated by Jefferson and as they have
been construed by all'thVgreat men who have led the
Democratic party up to the time of the holding of
the unhappy convention of iSo6, when the old organi
zation was broken up."
Just before his death the . late General John M.
Palmer said: "Imperialism is a false alarm. The
country is not. nor arc McKinley and his followers,
believers in imperialism. Mr. Bryan is the high priest
of Populism, a faction that is already strong enough
to menace the "best interests of a safe government.
Between McKinley and Bryan there is but one course
âto vote for McKinley."
That statement shows that the German point of
view is exactly that of all other conservative elements
in American life. In fact, it shows that there is no
such thing as a German vote distinct from American
votes. Our German fellow citizens are Americans.,
like the rest of us, and have common interests to pro
tect and a common patriotism to animate them. The
conclusions of Mr. Ottendorfer are exactly the same
aÂ«i those of all conservative citizens of whatever race
or of whatever former party differences. Eminent
Democrats as well as eminent Republicans have re
peatedly announced them. '
One of the most influential Germans in the coun
try, Oswald Ottendorfcr, editor of the New York
Staats Zeitung, has brought his paper squarely into
line for McKinley. In an editorial repeating his ob
jection to the Philippine policy of the administration
he says: "In spite of all this we consider a Repub
lican victory less dangerous for the welfare of the na
tion than the election of William J. Bryan. He has
shown in his formal letter of acceptance and in nu
merous speeches delivered since then that he has not
learned, cannot and will not learn, anything in regard
to the financial question: that his ignorance and lack
of perception in this direction are incurable. He
must be considered the greater immediate danger.
His election would undoubtedly produce widespread
disturbance of present economic conditions, from
which hardly anybody would escape, and which would
subject a large part of the American people to severs
suffering."
It is fortunate for the boasters that they took their
rejoicing early iu the game, for otherwise they would
not have had it at all. German voters arc not given
to early shouting. Some of them wished the admin
istration had done more for the Hoers. some are op
posed, like Senator Hoar, to the annexation of the
Philippines, but none of them had any admiration for
Bryan. They' waited for the campaign to shape it
self so they might learn exactly what is to be ex
pected of the two parties. They have now seen and
heard; they have made up their minds and are an
nouncing a determination to remain steadfast in sup
port of the party of prosperity and good government.
DURING the early days of the campaign, while
the silly season was at its height, Democratic
orators, organs, boomer* and rooters had a
halcyon and vociferous time over the German vote.
They claimed it as their o>vn, and boasted a lead pipe
cinch on it. They did not wait for a single egg to be
laid before counting all the chickens in the neigh
borhood as theirs. They put down all the Statei
where there is any considerable number of Germans
as sure for Bryan. Ohio. Illincis, Wisconsin and
Michigan were announced as certain to give their
electoral votes to the champion of free silver and
anti-imperialism.

JAMES B. GRANT, elected Gov
ernor of Colorado in 1882 on the
Democratic ticket, president oi the
Grant Smelting and Refining Com
pany, and a life-long Democrat, has de
clared strongly in favor of the re-elec
tion of President McKinley. He gives
his reasons in the following statement:
Editor San Francisco Call : I am go
ing to support the Republican ticket
this year because I think it is the only
one a sane man can support. This gab
ble about silver, what little of it Bryan
permits to creep into his Western
speeches and interviews, is too silly for
consideration. Silver is dead as a door
nail. If Bryan were elected, too, pro
vider! he carried out his promises, he
would overturn the American foreign
policy which has won respect abroad,
and would make us absurd in the eyes
of the world. My vote will be to let
McKinley finish what he has so well
begun. J. B. GRANT.

Times.
UP-TO-DATE
EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
That the public is rapidly coming round to that
view of the subject is no longer to be doubted. The
Call has supported it in this State and several, of the
best authorities in the wine industry have approved it.
In fact, right labeling is in the interest of the State.
There is no reason why California should not be as
renowned for its wine as for its fruit, and if our wine
makers display the name of the State conspicuously
on their wine they will soon make it so. The lesson
taught at Paris ought to be accepted in good faith
and not scouted at as an example of French unfairness
or jealousy. We have only to stand by the rule of or
der to obtain from it a larger profit than we could
ever get by sending our wine to market under foreign
labels.
The same view has been taken by others. Lee J
Vance, editor of the American Wine Press and Min
eral Water News, is quoted as saying American wines
are fine enough to stand on their own merits, and do
not need any French name to make them sell. He
admits it will be necessary to keep the names of
French wine districts to describe different kinds of*
wine which are made in this country, because these
names have come to be almost generic in the public
mind, but he advocates their use on the labels in such
a way that there can be no mistake as to the place of
origin of the wine. Thus he says if a winemaker
would use the label "California Sauterne" it would
be entirely fair and unobjectionable to the French
or any one else.
false labeling is not confined to the United States.
The writer says it is common in other wine coun
tries, and adds: "It is done in Germany particularly
with an unquestioned fraudulent purpose." Conse
quently he holds that the French ruling is right, and
that we have no good reason to object to it.
'Flunking people see in this the perpetuation of a'l
trusts, of all combinations in which Mr. Bryan's
friends happen to be interested, and they will be 'found
in a great many such combinations if he is elected. The
Tammany method of giving immunity for a consid
eration appears in Bryan's dismissal of the ice trust
issue. Every corporation in Xew York City that will
not give Croker and his friends an interest is attacked
and bedeviled by T-immany. Those which bestow
their stock on King Croker and his courtiers are not
only let alone but are given facilities and advantage?,
as the ice trust was given exclusive dockage.
We r.re to understand, then, that when a combina
tion buys out all opposition, gets a monopoly on the
dockage which is necessary to carry out its business,
and by the official favor of Tammany has the three
millions of people of New York City at its mercy, it is
merely local, and therefore not deserving of
Colonel Bryan's attention!
That the leaders of his party in New York are in
that trust: that Croker as king of New York gave it
public favors in docking and patronage: that it put
up the price of ice 100 per cent in the hot weather,
to the distress of the poor.* who cannot go to the
country in the summer, are all facts, but Colonel
Bryan decides that they arc not national facts but
local facts.
Another evidence that Bryan is going to pieces is
his answer to a Dakota question about the Tammany
ice trust. He replied, "The New York ice trust is
not a national affair."
Now it is impossible that Bryan should have uttered
such a vicious statement, such a misleading and per
nicious appeal, for any other purpose than to create
prejudice against banks and deceive his hearers into
putting their hands to the work of destroying a sys
tem which Lincoln says was for the protection of
bbcr against the fluctuations of a vicious currency.
U Bryan is not a sheer cretin he knows that a na
tional bank does not issue its note as a promise to
pay money that it has borrowed, but as a promise to
redeem that note in actual money. Its note is a title
to money which it issues to those who want to use
money and desire to pay for its use. A national bank
ing association desiring to go into business with $100.
ooo capital must have that amount of actual money
and must buy with it Government bonds and deposit
them in the treasury. The Government then issues to
the bank $100,000 in notes; each note is evidence that
the bank has in the hands of the Government the ac
tual money to redeem the note. The bank gets 2 per
cent interest on its bonds, and it pays a nearly equal
tax on its circulation, so that its net return on its
$100,000 of capital must come from interest paid by
those who borrow that capital. Its note is not issued
to borrow money, like a note of hand, but is a title to
money that it has deposited with the Government in
bonds. "When a private individual issues his note,"
says Mr. Bryan, "he issues it for the purpose of ob
taining money and pays interest as long as he has the
money." and adds: "When you can obtain interest
on your notes instead of paying interest, you will be
as good as the banks." Of course he knows, if he
know anything, that the bank note is issued not to
obtain money, bm as evidence that the bank has
money to the amount of that note in the treasury of
the United States ready to redeem it. The indi
vidual's note is not issued as evidence that he has
money, but that he has not, and therefore has rente!
the use of it and will pay a certain rent called interest.
We have already quoted Lincoln's recommendation
of the national banks in his second message. In very
few words Lincoln stated the essentials of the system.
His failure to distinguish between a note of lnn<i
and a circulating medium may be simulated. He may
not he such a fool as that speech makes him seem
He may know better, but be. unable to resist his nat
ural gift of deception.
It is somewhat difficult to deal patiently with such
rot. Hut it is of that quality of stuff which he utter*
that is rousing fear and widespread apprehension of
what would follow the elevation of such a man to
power.
In pursuance of his proposition to destroy the
banks he has taken up that issue among the farmer 1 ;.
Talking to them in Nebraska the other day lie said:
"Whenever the private individual issues his note he
issues it for the purpose of obtaining money and pays
interest as long as he has the money: the national
bank issues its note as money and draws interest on
the notes while they r.rc outstanding. When you can
obtain interest on your notes instead of paying inter
est, you will be as good as the banks."
IT is evident that Bryan is going into the air before
he riches the backstretch and will not get on his
feet again during the race. His acceptance speech
at Indianapolis had in it some meager evidences of an
attempt to think out an issue, -but it was injured by
the appearance of his chronic tendency to overstate.
His spirit of exaggeration outruns all discretion.
Since that speech was made he has to accept the Pop
ulist nomination and campaign in those States where
Populism is not yet dead, but sick, though promising
to be able to leave its bed long enough to vote for
him. In that part of his campaign he has rioted
again in all sorts of extravagance.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Water Front Notes.
Al Murphy, a City 'Transfer man, was
locked up in the harbor police station
yesterday by Sergeant "Tom" Mahoney
on a charge of extortion. This Is the first
arrest of the kind, in six months, and goes
to show how well Sergeant Mahoney and
his men have the runners in hand.
Monday night Fong Sing arrived from
the interior en route to China. He is
booked to. sail on the Coptic to-morrow.
At the ferry Murphy got hold of him
and by a roundabout way took him to Du
pont and Clay streets, charging $2 50 for
the run. The regular charge Is 35 cents.
Now, For.g's cousin happens to be secre
tary ot the Six Companies, and when he
heard the story he at once made his com
plaint. Result. Al Murphy is locked up
on a charge of extortion and has to re
main in jail for lack of $50 bail.
The bark Gerard C. Tobey. which ar
rived from Comox, B. C. yesterday, has
been purchased by Welch & Co. and will
go Into the Hawaiian trade. Captain West
Gove Jr. is master of her.
Captain West Gove Sr. retires from the
bark General Fairchlld. and Captain Wil
liam H. Ellis takes his place.
Captain Charles Davis takes command
of the bark Coryphene. Captain Erlcksen
remains ashore and will take a new ves
sel now building for the same company.
The new ferry steamer San Pablo will
go on the drydock Thursday and will have
her trial trip Saturday.
First of the Whaling Fleet.
The Pacinc Steam Whaling Company's
Balaena returned from the Arctic yester
day after an ususually successful season.
She ran into a school of whales and be
fore the leviathans escaped the crew of
the steamer had secured 47,000 pounds of
bone and ISO barrels of oil. So plentiful
were the cetaceans that oil was not
thought of and all the men secured in
nearly every instance was the head. In
round figures the catch of the Balaena Is
worth J2UO.O0U. â¢
The Balaena left here on March 19 of
last year and went direct to Bering Sea.
From Dutch Harbor .she made her way
north to Point Barrow and there the
whales began to appear. Captain Williams
followed them over to the Siberian coast
and made a "ten strike" every. time.
When whale after whale was taken the
men began to weary of the work and de
manded a return to San Francisco. The
Balaena's prow was accordingly turned
this way, but luck still followed her and
more whales were taken. A stay of a
couple of weeks was made at Dutch Har
bor to clean and assort the bone.
Captain Williams reports the catch of
the remainder of the fleet up to August
22 as follows: Jeanette 1, Narwhal 2,
Grampus 10, William Baylies clean, Alex
ander 1, Fearless 2 and Bowhead clean.
Up to August 22. therefore, the whalers
have made a very poor showing.
Wisconsin's Trial Trip.
The battleship Wisconsin will leave for
Santa Barbara Channel to-day to have
her trial. The Ranger left for the scene
of action a couple of days ago, the Una
dilla followed Sunday and the Iowa and
Philadelphia followed yesterday. The four
latter vessels will be used as stake
taoats. The trial of the big battleship will
probably take place next Thursday, but.
of course, everything will depend upon
the wind and weather.
Challenger Reports Finding Mast of
a Ship Floating in the Water.
Shipping men are wondering what ves
sel bound from Europe to this coast lost
a mast off the Horn. The American ship
Challenger at Honolulu from New York
reports that on July 24 in latitude 40Â° 41'
south, longitude S9' 35' west (about 1000
miles from the Horn in the Pacific), a ves
sel's mast was passed.
"It looked like a foremast broken off
half way up," says the captain. "It was
lying Hat in the water and the yards were
attached. The topsails and topgallant
sails were set and the royals were furled.
1 think tho sails were made of cotton
duck. The lower mast was a whole stick,
not a built mast. Kept a man aloft ill
day on the lookout, but did not see any
thing of the vessel. The Challenger was
running at the time under whole topsails
and foresail. Weather squally."
DISASTER OFT THE HORN.
THE British four-masted bark
Glencalrd has been having a hard
time of It lately. She came here
from Newcastle. N. S. W., and
soon after her arrival all of the
crew deserted. This did not bother Cap
tain English, however, as every deserter
meant a saving to the ship of from *40 to
$50 In back pay.
The Glencalrd went from England to
Australia and from the Island Continent
to San Francisco, and all the men got dur
ing the year which it took to make the
run was what they could draw from the
slop chest and a few shillings advanced
by the captain from time to time.
As matters turn out now the master of
the Glencaird would havÂ« done well to
have kept his men by the ship. The ves
sel Is loaded .*nd ready to fall, but for
nearly a week It has been impossible to
obtain a crew. Saturday a gang of hobos
was put aboard, but a Sunday aboard ship
was too much for them and yesteraay
morning they came ashore bag and bag
gage. Some of them complained that the
ship was overloaded, and the attention of
Captain Metcalf. Lloyd's surveyor, wn.s
called to the matter. A rigid examination
was made and Captain Metcalf refussd to
allow the vessel to go to sea. Then cap
tains Watson. Thayer and Mills, repre
senting the underwriters, were called in
and they decided that the ship was not
overloaded. Captain Metcalf still Insists
that the vessel is below her Plimsol mark,
but waives his right In view of the action
of the underwriters.
The chances are that a new crew will be
procured for the Glencaird to-day and
Captain English will at once proceed to
sea.

A young lady from Denver, Colo., recently wrote a letter
to Mrs. Pinkham, which aptly pictures the condition of a
great many young women. She says :
â¢'This is the first opportunity I have found to writo and thank you for
the good your Vegetable Compound has done me. I feel better than I have
for years. It Eeems a ' seven days' wonder ' to my friend3. Where I used to
be pitiod, everything -is the opposite now, and there ia not a d3y but what a
some ono wants to know -what I have done to make myself look so well. I
"Before taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound I had can- I
etant headaches, was constipated, bloated, eyes weak and watery, bearing- I
down pains, pains in the small of my back and right side; took cold very N
easily, which always caused intense pain in the ovaries, and I did not 'want m
to go anywhere or see any one. I was called cross, but I could not help it, |
feeling as I did. I could not lift anything or do any hard work without |
suffering for days afterwards. Menstruation lasted for eight or ten days, a
the first three or four days being almost constant pain day and night." A
What a picture this is, and how unnecessary I Read the I
letters which follow and see how easy it is to overcome 3
woman's suffering when, you go the right way about it. B
Nothing in this wide world has relieved so much female I
suffering as has Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com- 9
pound; no medicine can produce such positive proof of |
cures and gbod results ; therefore, no other medicine can be 3
"just as good." Women should insist upon getting the med- 9
icme which has the best record, and which, they and every y
druggist in the land know, has no equal. 3
Miss Thompsons Pains are Cured. A
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â I want to tell you what L.ydia E. IMnfc- 1
ham's Vegetable Compound has done for me. For several years I had I
suffered with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, palpitation of I
the heart, headache, pains in nearly all parts of tho body. My physician ;J
said it was only indigestion, but his medicine did rot help me any. I began H
the use of your Vegetable Compound. I have taken four bottles and now fl
those troubles are cured. I cannot praise it enough."â Mi33 Belle S. i
Thompson, Box 14, Acushnet, Mass. a
Just why Miss Thompson's physician diagnosed her I
trouble as indigestion it is hard to understand. This mistake, 1
however, is frequently made. If you have any doubt about I
your case, write to Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass., for her I
free advice. She will understand your symptoms at once. I
Miss 5choltes Tells of Suffering Overcome. i
â¢â¢ Dkae Mrs. Pinkham : â I writo to let you know that Lydia E. Pink- 9
ham's Vegetable Compound has cured me of painful menstruation from y
which I suffered terribly. I really believe that I would be insane Unlay if it I
had not been for. your medicine. I cannot praise your G->to pound enough, 8
and feel that if all who suffer from female troubles would put themselves Â§
under your care and follow your advice, they will find relief from their I
sufferings."â Miss K. E. Scholtes, Mt Oliver, Pittsburg, Pa. * \

WHEATâ Liverpool and Pario were lower,

Chicago was weaker under depressing cables,
but there were more buyers than sellers at the
decline. The quantity on passage Increased
600 000 bushels. An Increase In the American
visible supply waa expected; but there waa
none, much to the general surprise, and the
market became firmer In conseauence.r- Early
sellers could not replace their holdings with
out advancing the market. The world's ship
ments were laree. About half the milling ca
pacity of Minneapolis closed down to take ad
vantage of the poor flour demand to make re

CHICAGO, Oct. S. â November wheat opened
*Â»c higher at TTVi'&TTHc on selling:, part oÂ£ It for
foreign account; dropped during the forenoon
to 77\ic. In this the factors were a decline at
Liverpool and clear cool weather in the North
west, together with liberal Northwestern re
ceipts and the closing of some of the Minne
apolis mills. There was considerable Bhort
selling on the early expectation of half a million
increase In the visible. The statement, how
ever, showed hO.COO bushels decrease and on re
buying by those who sold at first November
rallied sharply to 77%c; shorts being satisfied
the market weakened and closed dull, %c low
er at 76"jc.
Corn was firm and active on a good shipping
demand. November closed %c up at 37%Â®37T4c.
Oats were- extremely dull, closing unchanged
at 2-Vi^i22 s iiC lor November.
Provisions were quiet. The market showed
firmness early because of the hogs receipts be
ini? 5000 head under the estimates. Octqber
pork sold oft from $17 to $16 and November re
linquished its early gain in sympathy. Lard
and ribs also eased off a trifle, but closed
steady. January pork closed 2V4c lower, lard 5c
higher and ribs a shade up.

That the shore of tne gulf upon which
Galveston Is situated is gradually slnkir.?
Is a fact which cannot be disregarded. A
city which had an elevation of only
twelve feet at most cannot last long even
with a subsidence of one to two feet In
a century. Direct evidence of the grei
eral sinking of the Atlantic coast la given
by the configuration of the land. Even the
historical record show3 that, though Im
perceptible In a single year, the advance
of the sea is considerable when decades
are compared and enormous when meas
ured by centuries.â New York Post.

XEW YORK. Oct. g.â Trading on the Stock
Exchange to-day was marked by a revival Â«f a
considerable bear party, whose activities were
aggressive and pcrsirtent. Their efforts to de
prers prices were contested by the speculative
holders of long stock, who were successful last
week In lifting prices in spite of the various
uciavcrable factors which developed in the sit
uation. The conflicting forces at work were re
flected In a feverish and irregular movement of
Trices. The marked depletion of basking re
eerves revealed by the Saturday bank state
ment, had the eilect of unsettling speculative
Ci'lnioa. There was a constant variation be
tween aparf-hention over a constriction of the
money supply and the prospect of relief by Im
ports of sold. The conviction became pretty
well settled as the day progressed that the
cold would move from London to New York
this week. The market for foreign exchange
fell feveriFhly by successive stages throughout
the day end demand sterling closed a full cent
below Friday's level. This price Is within a
email fraction of the level generally agreed
upon as offering a profit on Imports of gold at
the present price of gold and rate for money In
London, and Is probably within the limit that
would- allow the special transactions which
generally prect-de a regular gold movement in
a etraggllug fashion. Owing to the temporary
&bunduice of money in London on account of
Government financial operations and receipts
of cold from Indian payment for silver, dis
count rates continue to fall there and offer no
resistance to the pn-ssure upon it for gold. The
email movement of gold frum London to Ber
lin to-day was in response to the exchange
sterling from London to New York, which
progressed in connection with the payment ot
subscriptions to the German loan. A member
of the German loan syndicate broadly inti
mated to-day that rwjulri-mentÂ» for exchange
In payment of subscriptions to the loan were
about satisfied and expressed the opinion that
the i arr.e was true in connection with the Brit
ish loan. Without this future demand to sup
t>ort tbÂ« exchange market, the flood of cotton
bills which continue to appear in the market
Insures a movement hitherto of gold which
only a sharp advance in Toreign discount rates
vi-ill scn-e to check. Such a contest for gold
bm would thus be precipitated, even if it result
ed in favor of New York, might be altogether
reapsurins circumstances for speculators, as
the forcing of liquidation in foreign markets
miÂ«Â±t have a reflex action here. Hence the
unsettlemcnt of the speculative mind to-day In
spite of the i>ro*i>ect tit gold imports. With
the exception of a period of strength In the
Iron and steel stocks, led by Tennessee Coal
end Iron and Colorado Fuel, the reactionary
tendency was predominant and the leading
stocks wore eff from 1 to 3 points. With the
late break in call money and the fall in ex
charure to about the gold point, prices rallied
somewhat, fcut the market closed feverish and

were exceptions among the hlÂ«;h grade bonds

A tragedy in low life which may result
fatally occurred in the lodsring' house for
merly conducted by Billy Abbott at 423
Dupont street early yesterday afternoon.
Thomas F. Fallon. known as "Hasher
Tom," was shot in the head by an opium
fiend who travels under many aliases, but
13 best known as "Curley" Cole. The in
jured man -was conveyed to the Receivtnjc
Hospital and the shooter made his escape.
The revolver used was a cheap affair and
the bullet did not penetrate the brain, but
fractured a portion of the frontal bone.
The shooting was the result of jealousy,
in which a woman known as Maude Wil
liams plays a conspicuous part. There
are two other persons named Williams in,
the case, but they are not related to each,
other. Both of the principals in the affair
are opium flenda. and Cole had just been
released from jail when he committed the
crime.
Cole had been llvlnjr with the Williams
woman for nearly a month. Recently Fal
lon appeared on the scene as a suitor for
the .lady's affections, and she besran to>
neglect Cole, who became very Jealous
and made threats afralnst his rival.
When Cole was released from Jail yes
terday mornins and returned homo ha
found Fallon in a room with the woman.
A quarrel ensued and tho shot was fired.
Fallon will not die.

Supervisor McCarthy had filed a report
in which he recommended that the au
thorization be cut to $3000 and | stated
among other things that he had received
an estimate of $2525 as the cost of the gal

which cost $340. The Board of Public
Works filed a report in answer to that of
McCarthy in which it stated that it had
Invited the San Francisco Flreprooflng
Company to perform the work for the
sum named, and recommending the ac

lic Buildings Barnett, detailing a history
of the original contract entered into for
the construction of the gallery, was filed.
Barnett accused McCarthy of animus In
his strictures on the Board of Public
Works.
The caustic report filed by Supervisor
McCarthy last week. In which he demon
strated that the estimate of the cost of
the police photograph gallery in the Hall
of Justice made by the Board of Public
Works was entirely too high, has borne
good fruit. The board recommended to
the Supervisors yesterday that the com
pany which made the estimate of $2525
be invited to bid for the work and if it
compiled with the request that it receive
the contract. This will effect a savins
of nearly $1000 In the original figures of

tition of the veterans, as there, were sev
eral rooms yet available.
Brandenstein submitted an amendment
requiring the company to file an agree
ment to begin the work of restoring the
pavement to its original condition on all
streets where it had abandoned tracks,
but it was lost. LJraunhart presented an
amendment, â¢which was also lost, requir
ing the poles and appliances to be of
home manufacture. He contended that
the company should be compelled to com
ply with the charter and objected to the
favorable report of the Public Utilities
Committee, which, he Eaid, contained
everything in favor of the company and
nothing in favor of the people. Heed said
there was a general law making it oblig
atory on the company to keep the streets
in proper repair. The Mayor said there
was difficulty in compelling the company
to live up to the law. Tobin said ho
would vote against the franchise because
the wires were not to be placed under
ground and because the company had not
complied with promises heretofore made.
Secretary Painter of the North Central
Improvement Club said that all the im
provement clubs and merchants In the
downtown districts favored the granting
of the franchises. The vote on the or
dinances was as follows: Ayes â Booth.

During his sojourn In the far eastern
country Prince Poniatowski remarked
that he saw the Ormonde filly, bred at the
Napa stock farm of A. B. Spreckels, step
a quarter in 23 seconds, and it was the
opinion generally expressed that she will
be a crackajack. The young miss brought
$1400 at the sale held in New York last
August.
Perry Hildreth has lost his useful bread
winner Captive. The big chestnut horse,
which arrived at Oakland track last week
with the string of W. P. Magrane, con
tracted a cold and died on Sunday night.
A report erroneously circulated in the
East stated that the California season
would open November 19 at Tanforan
Park. Oakland track will set the ball in
motion Saturday, November 3.
There will be no dearth of saddle talent,
for "Winnie O'Connor, Henry, Bullman,

Local race-goers may also have the
pleasure of seeing the colors of Mr. Feath
erstone of Chicago carried to the post, as
the owner of Mesmerist stated that he
would send a select stable this way In
charge of Julius Bauer, the noted trainer.
It has already been published that such
well known horsemen as Sam Hildreth,
Pat Dunne. Barney Schreiber and Albert
Simons will be represented by some choice,
bits of thoroughbred horse ttesh.
As steeplechase and hurdl? racing will
be strong-ly featured by the Tanforan As
tociatlon, the public may expect to see a
revival of tills exciting but uncertain
game. So, too, will events for hunters re
ceive consideration from the programmer.
J. \V. Colts, an enthusiast at the timber
topping sport, told Prince Ponlatowski he
Â¦would ship over the crack "leppers" Ben
Edcr and Dr. Catlett, while C. Whit
ney will send game old The Bachelor. A
number of Canadian horses may also par
ticipate.
Although Tanforan Park is without a
steeplechase course, ground will be
broken for one to-day. Xo hurdle events
will be less than one mile and a half,
while races through the field will vary
from two to three miles. The course will
be a stiff one, a "Liverpool" with a stone
fence four feet high and, sixty feet wide,
with wings on each side, being down for
construction. The water jump will be
placed nearly opposite the grand stand.
Some valuable stakes to be offered are
exrected to attract the select of the Jump
ing brigade.
To accommodate the expected rush ten
new stables will be erected, each to con
tain forty stalls. Tanforan will then be
able to house over 700 horses and training
over Ingleside track will soon become a
thing of the past. The new jockey club's
projector also said it had been decided to
build another paddock 500x300 feet on a
different scale from others In vogue. The
new ore will be open, with walks which
will permit of ladies promenading and
scanning the starters.
Prince Andre Poniatowski, organizer of
the new San Francisco Jockey Club, arr
rived from the East on Friday night last,
after a somewhat protracted visit In the
interest of the association over which he
Mill preside. The Prince received assur
ances from many prominent Eastern own
ers, among them James R. Keene, Pierre
Lorillard and W. C. Whitney, that they
would in all probability ship strings to
California. He thinks the prospect for the
coming season the brightest in the his
tory of the srort this side of the Rockies.

that the house will bf crowded to-night.
The managers of the Republican cam
paign in this State are receiving encourag
ing reports from the several Congressional
districts. Many well-known citizens who
were Democrats prior to the introduction
of Bryanlsm have openly announced their
intention to vote for President McKinley
and assist in the election of a Republican
Congress to sustain the administration.
The minority, faction was represented
by Charles Pettls and C. F. Buckley. They
allegeu that their side had held a pri
mary in which nineteen citizens partici
pated.
Both sides were heard by the Commis
sioners, and after an animated discussion,
in which allegations of fraud were numer
ously made, the Commissioners decided
to accept the ticket of.the regular Citi
zens' Republican party as represented by
Forbes, Scott and Truman, as it had com
plied with the law in all respects.
A. Lewis addressed the commission in
opposition to the petition of the Social
Democratic party, represented by Cam

TbÂ« escape of an insane eoldler come
time ago from the Presidio van in which

of the manner in which the mad soldier
made hla escape led to the Issuance of
an order by General Snafter directing
that in the future the mien remain in con
linement as it was possible- that a patient
whose insanity is ot a violent form might
secure his liberty and do a great deal of
damage-. The escape of the patient whose
case was cited was due to an insufficiency
of g-uards. owing to the small number of
troops stationed at the Presidio, and un

Tbe question under present consideration Ls
Â¦whÂ«n a secondary or incidental vein crosses
a common side line between -two mining locu
tions at an an?!e and the apex of the vein
is of Â»uch width that It Is tor a riven dis
tance partly within one claim and partly -with
in the othÂ»r, to whom does such portion of
the vein belong? This question does not ap
pear to have been ever directly passed upon
by the courts. A mining claim can have but
two end lines, and havingr been once estab
lished they become the end lines for all veln3
found within the surface boundaries. This
court haÂ» already determined that the line
BCD shown in the diagram introduced on
the trial Is a side line common to the two
claims, and therefore it cannot be considered
the end line for the Drum Lummon vein. If
then In construction of law the vein in the
twenty-flve feet in controversy must be either
upon the one location or the other, and if
the senior locator has priority of title it would
follow that the rlpht of lateral pursuit would
remain with the senior locator within a plane
parallel to the end line of the senior claim
and up to the point of departure of the apes,
or. in this case, the footwall. inasmuch sub
neither statute nor authority permits a division
of the crossing portion of the vein, and th
welrht of authority favors the locator,
the entire v*ln must be considered as apexing
under the senior location until It has wholly
P&ssed beyond lta side line.
Judge Morrow delivered the opinion of
the Court of Appeals, In the course of
which he observed;
The plaintiff claimed the right to pur
sue the Drum Lummon vein extralater
ally so long as any part of the apex of
the vein was within the boundaries of the
St. Louis claim. The Circuit Court Judge
of Montana charged the jury that so long
as the Drum Lummon vein apexed entire
ly within the St. Louis claim the plaintiff
could follow it in Its dip under the Nine
Hour claim, including tho iO-foot strip
referred to in the complaint.
The case is that of the St. Louis Min
ing and Milling Company of Montana va.
the Montana Mining Company, limited.
The action was brought in Montana by
the St. Louis Mining: and Milling Com
pany to recover damages for trespass and
the vaJue of certain ores alleged to have
been wrongfully appropriated and taken
by the Montana Mining Company, a cor
poration, of Great Britain. A verdict was
given awarding the plaintiff $23,209. The
plaintiff, however, not being- satisfied with
the amount of damages awarded It took
an appeal to the United States Circuit
Court of Appoals upon errors which de
prived it of a verdict for a larger sum.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
sitting in the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals with United States Circuit
Judges Gilbert and Ross, handed down
an opinion yesterday that will be found
of more than ordinary Interest to mine
owners and mine workers all over the
country. Judge Gilbert concurred in the
opinion and Judjre Ross dissented.

OAKLAND,* Oct. 8.â The only sug
gestion of contest to stir a breeze
at this year's Methodist Church South
Conference came with the closing
session this afternoon, when Fres
no's delegates, lay and ministerial
aided by other strong San Joaquln
representatives, opened a fight to have
the conference of 1901 held at the Raisin
City. Oakland was too strong for the
country delegations, though, and was
again selected by a two-to-one vote as
the conference city. It was a good na
tured struggle, the chief argument on the
Fresno side being the desire to give the
church In the San Joaquin district an op
portunity to attend the annual conference
without the long and expensive trip to the
bay.
In token of their appreciation of the
work of Bishop W. W. Duncan of North
Carolina, who presided, the conference
adopted resolutions requesting the Bishop
to conduct the annual and the district
conferences noxt year. Bishop Duncan
expressed his appreciation of -the request.
The conference decided that on October
28 collections for the benefit of the Meth
odist sufferers by the Texas floods shall
be taken in all of the churches of the
conference..
Bishop Duncan announced during? the
morning session that Washington Duke,
a philanthropist of note, had given a sec
ond $100,000 toward the Trinity College of
North Carolina, a famous Methodist the
ological Institution.
It was reported to the conference that
the members of the church in Berkeley
were moving to establish themselves on
an independent footing. To that end Bish
op Duncan In tils appointments announced
that a supply would be furnished. Rev.
J. C. Wooton was reappolnted to the Oak
land church. Rev. E. H. McWhorter will

On Saturday Judge Cook took occasion
to ny that Dr. Clinton's statements re
garding her condition were "colored by
j>rejud!ce" and he suggested that Dr. A.
W. Ptrry. in whom he had tne utmost
confidence, should be asked to examine
21rs. Craven and report as to her condi
tion.
Yesterday morning: when court con
vened Dr. Porry was called to the stand.
He was questioned by Attorney Riordau
ard answered that he ha<l Ken Mr*. Cra
ven three times recently, He saw her
Friday evening, but did not make any
examination, but Saturday evening he dH
so. He found that she was puffr-nrg from
hysterical paralysis and nervous prostra
tion. He did not thlr.k that coming into
court to-<lay or to-morrow or ev<Â»n with
in a week would er.danger her life. She
should have "rest" treatment for six
weeks and also treatment for wie stop
pas* of the hemorrhages from, which she
was suffering. There could be no possible
results under pIx weeks.
"Might not the, bringing her Into court,"
r>r. C. A. Clinton, who Is attending Mrs
Nettle R. Craven, threatens to pull some
body's nose owlnff to the reflections cast
upon htm in regard to tho lady's condi

as If something; in that way was.eoinÂ«Â»
to harp^n.

asked Rlordan, "increase the hemor
rhages in her present condition?"
"Not of Itself." replied the doctor, "but
it would be helped by the excitement."
"Would bringing her into court simply
to ask her to plead Rul'ty or not guilty
milan^er her life?" asked Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Deuprey.
"I repeat," replied the doctor, "that If
brought into court to-day, to-morrow or
within a week her life would not be en
dangered. She would suffer If brought
int<"> court say every day for three weeks."
At Attorney Riordan's suggestion the
Judge continued the case for three weeks
from laft Saturday.
"Are the physicians who are attending
her trying to stop these hemorrhages?"
asked tho Judge.
l>r. Clinton was in tho courtroom and
he waik<?d toward tho bench, lie r-eemed
to be laboring undor suppressed oxeite
inpnt. '"I am taking every care of my pa
tient," he paid to the Judge, "and every
thing that professional skill or science
can do is? hpfr.gr done to stop the hemor
rhncr^s and bring: her back to health."
That ended the matter, but when Dr.
Clinton got outside the courtroom he re
marked to Attorney Riordan that he
would pull somebody's nose if that sort
of thing- was kept up much longer. Attor
ney Klordan says that he will decline to
call any more physicians as experts as
to Mrs. Craven's condition, as he has had
eleven already.

Buckingham & Hecht's Employes
Quit Work When Union Laster
Is Discharged.
The employes of Buckingham & Hecht'a
shoe factory at Twenty-sixth and Valen
cia streets have walked out and the ma
chinery was Idle yesterday. There were
over 300 hands at work last week, union
and non-union, the shop being known as
"open." According to the statements of
Buckingham & Hecht and also of the
employes, the discharge of a man em
ployed as a laster was the cause that led
to the walkout.
Buckingham & Hecht issued a state
ment yesterday in which It was set forth
that "one of the men, a laster, who was
chronically Irregular In his hours of com
ing to work, was spoken to and warned
by the foreman of the department a num
ber of times and was requested to be more
prompt and regular in coming to work.
He paid no attention to the Instructions,
and in consequence was discharged last
Saturday afternoon at about 1:30 o'clock.
Very shortly thereafter all the men in the
bottoming and treeing departments left
the shop. This morning all hands re
mained out."
Last evening a representative of the
shoemakers made the following statement
at Pythian Castle, where a meeting was
held, at which nearly ail the employes of
Buckingham & Hecht were present:
"The welters have been getting 18 cents
per dozen. They used to dip two pairs
at once. The firm told them that they
must take an "oil can, and squirt water
Into the groove. They said that they
wanted a boy to do the work, as Cahn,
Nlckel?burg & Co. employ a boy for that
service, but this was refused. The welters,
numbering two, quit work, nnd that tied
up the lasters. After that one laster and
one welrer. were sent as a committee to
adjust the differences If possible. The
laster, who works by the pi^ce, lost half
an hour while acting on the committee
and the concern 'sacked' him. i He Is a
good man, and Industrious. After
he was gone the entire shop walked out.
If the union would stand to see tho laster
dropped under sveh circumstances It could
not last. We think that the concern was
afraid that the committee was trjing to
unionize the shop, which has been an
open shop, and made an excuse to get rid
of the laater." . â¢
A committee of employes will wait upon
Buckingham & Hecht to-day to get an
answer to resolutions adopted yesterday
In which the reinstatement of Fred
Masonbelder and a return to the old
method of work Is demanded, the alterna
tive to the last proposition being that
the firm shall pay the wages of a boy to
assist the welters. The employes, have
appointed Henry Gallagher as their busi
ness agent.

by E. Varsi as a boardinir-house and
the other by August FugonI as a stable.
A second alarm was turned In by Fire
Chief Sullivan and the fire was confined
to the three buildings named. The loss
will reach about $2003, most of which Is
covered by Insurance.
The owners of the South San Francisco
Packing House, which was gutted by fire
at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, estimate
their loss will reach $40,000. Fireman John

The Auditor's suggestion that Gordon
be appointed an inspector to serve after
regular office hours and be paid therefor
was not well received by 'his Honor, who
quoted the charter as not permitting such
a course, though he apparently failed to
realize the equally binding provision of
the charter which does not permit of aal
arles being Increased. ,
Reed said thÂ«e were really no addi
tional clerks to be appointed, but the
scheme simply contemplated an Increase
of salaries.'.-
Supervisor Brandenstein also opposed
the resolution and called attention to the
defects of the charter in the following lan
guage:
"We have no right, however Inadequate
the. charter may be, to override, its ex
press provisions. It is a regrettable cir
cumstance that the charter is deficient,
but we must accommodate ourselves to
it notwithstanding its shortcomings."
The Mayor, who did not appear pleased
at this confession, quoted the charter to
prove his right to recommend additional
clerks, but SuperviHor McCarthy called
attention to the fact that this power was
subject to the limitations of the charter,
which fixed the salary of, a Registrar's
clerk at $100 per month.
Reed opposed ,the resolution on the
ground that the payment of high salaries
to public officials was the cause of so lit
tle money being devoted to public Im
provements and because there is no rea
son to appropriate funds not provided for
in the budget. â¢

ALL DAY SUNDAY
Would Agree "With Her.
She Thought About a Food That
An unnatural appetite for rich and im-
proper food is kept aiivc by the
use of such foods, whereas a change to
healthful, nourishing and scientifically
made food will correct the unnatural ap-
petite. A little woman up at Peekskill
N. Y., Margaret Smith, P. O. Box iq.v
sa y6 :
"I was 6uch a sufferer from dyspepsia
that life was a burden. I could hardly
keep from eating all sorts of pastry,
cakes and other rich foods, although
they did not agree with me, nor, in fact,
did any sort of food. I became low-
spirited and discouraged, was too weak
to work and very seriously troubled with
palpitation of the heart.
"Drugs seemed to make me worse
rather than better. A friend oid one
day: 'I believe Grape-Nuts food would
cure you,' explaining that that food was
made with great care and intended for
the prevention" and relief of diseases that
were brought about by improper food..
"That was Saturday night, and all day
Sunday I kept thinking about Grape-
Nuts, and the first thing Monday morn-
ing I sent for a package. I had it^jn my
mind that the food would look like nuts,
and was disappointed when I found it
had to be eaten with a spoon. However.
I followed the directions and made a
meal of Grape-Nuts and milk, which I
found to be delicious, and for the first
time in months I suffered no distress
after eating.
"I at once began to feel hopeful that I
might be cured at last. Since that day I
have used Graiy-Xuts constantly, morn-
ing and night, and have steadily im-
proved in health, until now I am as well
as I ever was in my life: vveijrh 10
pounds more than I did a year aero, have
no palpitation of the heart and can work
all d2y long.
"At supper I have Grape-Nuts mixed
with soft,- boiled earsrs. I make mv din-
ner on any kind of food^ I desire. One of
the best things about this cure by oroper
food is that I no longer have any de-
sise for the rich, indigestible rubbish of
vhich I used to be so fond."

Morgue Surgeon Leland performed an
autopsy yesterday upon the body of the
unknown man who died suddenly last
Sunday afternoon In Fitzgerald's saloon
at the foot of Powell street and found
that pneumonia was the cause of death.
The stomach was sent to the city chemist
for analysis.
Died of Pneumonia.
Chief, Sullivan received a letter yester
day from Chief Henry Cullen of Nash
ville, Tenn., asking him to find out* if pos
sible the whereabouts of John Powers, a
butcher. He Is now about 51 years of age
and ran away from home when 11 years
old. It is supposed that he is in this city
or State. His mother is possessed of
some property and money and she has no
one to leave it to but him. His father,
who is dead, was James Powers.

SoutJierii . u..iic recei\rs JooOu a month
for allowing the Santa Fe the use of Its
tracks on this division.
The company has 163 locomotives, 30
belnpr added durlns the year. It has 1534
freight cars and 26 passenger cars.
Out of a total freight tonnage of 635,621
the company carried 165.6S2 tons of fruit
and vegetables, or 26 per cent of the entire
tonnage. . . â¢
The number of passengers carried, earn

The annual report of the Santa Pte Pa
cific Railway Company has been com
pleted and a copy of it was filed with
the State Board of Railway Â¦ Commission
ers yesterday. According to the report the"
company has 321 miles of track. The gross

SANTA FE'S ANNUAL REPORT.
At the request of the Santa Fe the lat
ter-company was allowed an extension of
fifteen days In which to file Its demurrer.
The Southern Pacific filed its answer two
weeks ago. The Commissioners decided
that the entire matter should be submit
ted in briefs, as Judge Sterry is going
Kast and he desired to have tne hearing
disposed of as speedily as possible.
The Commissioners instructed the secre
tary to write to the various railroad cor
porations who- have not yet sent in their
annual reports and notify. them that the
time for filing their statements has nearly
expired. Thus far thirty-five roids have
been heard from and nineteen are delin
quent. , The Southern Pacific Company
will not be able to make Its report before
the last of the month. v Â¦ â¢ â¢
The Railroad Commissioners held '. a
short meeting yesterday afternoon I and
took up the complaint of the Los Angeles
Traffic Association against the Santa Fe
and Southern Pacific companies, which,
among other things, charges. that the two
raiiroad corporations are maintaining a
local freight pool or combine in connec
tion with the San Joaquin Valley traffic.

The capitalist told Mr. Mills that he
meant business, but that he wished to
place one condition upon its final con
summation. That condition is that in the
event of Mr. Bryan's" election the trans
action will be declared off.
It is proposed to construct a railroad
from Rocklin, which Is about eighteen
miles east of Sacramento, Into the timber
belt for a distance of thirty-five miles or
more. Both the capitalist and the South
ern Pacific Company will put appraisers
Into the district at once. The country
which It is desired to purchase Includes
four townships. The deal will involve
fully $500,000, including the construction of
the railroad.
Upon the re-election of President Mc-
Kinley hinges one of the biggest timber
deÂ£.ls that has been carried out in "this
State for some time. A prominent Sacra
mento capitalist called upon William 'H.
Mills, land agent of the Southern Pacific,
yesterday, and requested that he be given
an option upon 25.000 acres of timber land
along the upper American River.
mated if McKinley Wins.
Half a Million Deal to Be Consum-
BIG TIMBER PURCHASE.
It is also positively stated that there is
absolutely no truth to the story that H.
E. Huntlngton had been offered the presi
dency but had declined.
"If Mr. Bryan is elected," said The
Call's informant yesterday, "the Southern
Pacltlc will, it is almost certain, have a
different man for president than will be
the case if Mr.' McKinley is retained in
the White House. The man who has betn
asked to direct the affairs of the com
pany will not, I .am told, accept the posi
tion in the event of Mr. McKlnley's de
feat."
Upon the outcome of the national fight
will depend very largely the selection of
the new chief executive of the Southern
Pacific. *
The new president of the. Southern Pa
cific will not be named until after the na
tional election. This Information comes
from such a source as to leave no doubt as
to its reliability.

Ht.NRY J. GALLAGHER CO..ORIGINAL PENCIL SKETCH OF FREDERTCH HOFMANN'S FAMOUS
PAINTING. "CHRIST IN GETHSEMANE," WHICH WAS PRESENT
ED BY THE GREAT ARTIST TO MRS. B. PAULSEN OF THIS CITY.
Hofmann Is nearly el<nty years of age.
but despite *his years he is erect and
alert. Like all geniuses he is unassuming
in manner. He is intensely interested in
California and pleased that his great
picture should be in the possession of a
Californian.
Bessie Wilson of this city, went to pay
her respects to the great painter. As
usual Hofmann's place was filled by the
housekeeper, who greeted all In the ar
tist's name. When it came to Mrs. Paul
sen's turn to meet her hostess she ex
pressed her regrets at not meeting Hof
mann, adding at the same time that she
had seen his painting "Christ in Geth
semane" at the Zeile home in San Fran
cisco. The mention of Mr. Zeile's prized
possession acted like magic. The house
keeper flew to tell the artist and .return
ing brought Mrs. Paulsen a special invi
tation to call upon Mr. Hofmann the fol
lowing day. Of course the lady from Cal
ifornia kept the appointment and then
she learned from the great man that he
had been ignorant as to the whereabouts
of his "Christ in Gethsemane," which he
considered his chief d'oeuvre, giving it the
preference over even his "Christ in the
Temple," which is hung in the Dresden
gallery.
A GRACEFUL token of a great
man's gratitude, a Christ head
from the pencil of the celebrated
painter, Frederick Hofmann, will
shortly be placed in the art gal
lery at the Park Museum.
The wonderful little pencil sketch is th.i
property of Mrs. B. Paulsen of this city.
It is the original from which the world
famous artist painted the Christ for his
picture "Christ In Gethsemane," which
is the property of John Zeile of 1717 Cali
fornia street.
It bears the signature of the great artist
affixed to a line of friendly greeting, t It
was presented to Mrs. Paulsen by Hof
mann during the lady's recent visit to
Dresden â a presentation that is wound
round with a delightful story. It has been
Hofmann's custom for years past to set
aside one day a month for a reception, at
which all American visitors are made wel
come. Of late years, on account of tho
artist's great age, ho has seldom appeared
at these functions, but in his stead hi3
housekeeper has dispensed the hospitality
of the magnificent villa.
On "American day" In August Mrs.
Paulsen, accompanied by Mrs. Ray of
Oakland and the Misses Lillie Toy and

ANNUAL SESSION
OF THE MASONS
However, the wedding of the prominent
couple will be celebrated within a few
months.
Lieutenant Potter Is now with his troop
in the Philippines and the date of. his
marriage to Miss McNutt has not yet been
set. It is not yet decided even whether
the ceremony will be performed here or
whether his fiancee will go to him at
Manila. It all depends upon whether he
will be able to get a leave of absence.
In the late 80s Potter was graduated
from the University of Cambridge in Eng
land. He has been a prominent figure in
New York clubdom, and although he has
had the entre he has generally eschewed
society. Good looks is a family charac
teristic of the Potters. Ashton Potter is
an extremejy handsome man, while his
niece, Miss Fifl Potter, has been voted
the most beautiful girl m New York* so
ciety. Her engagement, by the way, was
recently announced to the young multi
millionaire, James Stillman Jr. of New
York, son of the president of the National
City Bank.
Owing no doubt to the prominence of
his family undue notoriety was given Ash
ton Potter's actions while he was still
sowing his wild oats, but thoae who know
him best speak of him as a gentleman of
ability and rare promise, who has now
settled down and is regarded as one of
the most creditable officers in the service
of Uncle Sam.
Lieutenant Potter's father was a mem
ber of the well-known New York banking
house of Brown Brothers, having married
a daughter of the senior member of that
firm. He left a large fortune to be di
vided among his children, one of whom,
a daughter, married J. Kennedy Tod. a
wealthy lawyer of Gotham.
Ashton Potter is a nephew of the Epis
copal Bishop of New York, H. C. Potter,
L.L.D., D.C.L., etc., and the younger
brother -of James Brown Potter, whose
marital troubles with his beautiful actress
wife from whom he was divorced arc
known the world over. His grandfather
was Alonzo Potter, Episcopal Bishop of
Philadelphia, who, in 1859, died in the har
bor of San Francisco, where he had just
arrived after a voyage around the Horn
in search of health.
Both the prospective bride and groom
have been engaged before; Miss McNutt
to Lieutenant Rhun of the navy and Lieu
tenant Potter to Miss Carter of Philadel
phia. In each case * the engagement was
broken off. ; " - :
Miss McNutt Is the eldest daughter of
Dr. "W. F. McNutt, the well-known local
physician, owner of the McNutt Hos
pital and member of the Board of Police
Commissioners.
While the announcement will not come
altogether as a surprise to the swell set,
of which the bride-to-be Is one of the
handsomest and cleverest representatives,
still It will not fail to arouse much in
terest In military, professional and social
circles.
At a tea to be held this afternoon at
the McNutt residencs on Pacific avenue
the engagement of Miss Mamie McNult
and Ashton Potter, second lieutenant of
the Fourth Cavalry, now stationed in Ma
nila, will be formally announced.

tution allows charters to provide for the
Another suit against the civil service
provisions of the charter was filed yester
day in tho County Clerk's office by George
D. Squires. It is an action for an injunc
tion to prevent the payment of money for
certain purposes of the Civil Service Com
mission, and If it prove successful the
authority of the commission will be re
moved from the county offices and will be
greatly limited in the municipal offices.
The suit is brought with Timothy Crow
ley, a blacksmith, as plaintiff, who ap
pears as a taxpayer who does not wish
his taxes to be illegally expended. He
contends that in creating vacancies in the
various offices by examining employes of
county offices and throwing out those who
do not come up to the standard the com
mission is spending his money unlaw
fully.
The Civil Service Commission has been
getting down to the county offices lately
in Its progress toward examining all city
employes. The Sheriff's employes have
been examined, and several of the men
looked on as almost indispensable to the
office failed to make the standard and
were marked for dismissal by the com
mission. The turn of the other offices is
rapidly coming, and the employes decided
that something had to be done quickly
or they would be turned out into the cold.
The suit is the result.
The principal contention in the suit Is
that over the strictly county offices the
civil service has no jurisdiction at all.
These Include the offices of the Sheriff.
County Clerk, Assessor, Recorder. Cor
oner and some others. It is claimed that
under the State law these officers have the
power to appoint their own deputies as
they please, and also that under the same
law it is set forth that in all cases the
appointing authority has the power to re
move the appointee.
It is further suggested that in the case
of the municipal offices, such as those of
the Board of Works, the Board of Health,
the Tax Collector and the Supervisors,
the Civil Service Commission has power
only to fill such vacancies as occur by
death, resignation or removal, and the
further claim is made that the present
appointees can be removed only by the
appointing powerâ the head of the office.
The third important suggestion is that
the examinations given are unjust and
impractical and not calculated to proper
ly test the qualifications of the men ex
amined. It is pointed out that men who
have for years proved . their fitness for a
certain position have . failed to > make any
showing under the examinations imposed,
and consequently have had their places
jeopardized and sometimes made vacant-
There was a suit of a somewhat similar
nature tried before Judge Cook some time
ago. but it sought to throw out the com
mission Itself by the same methodâ that
of complaining that its expenditures were
not sanctioned by law. In the suit filed
yesterday, however, the aim Is not to
have the commission declared an illegal
body, but to limit its Jurisdiction, taking
it away altogether from the Btrictly
county offices and limiting it to the filling
of future vacancies in the municipal of
fices. The. last contention is a little com
plicated. It is claimed that when the
Civil Service Commission came into ex
istence it found in office a number of em
ployes who were presumably competent;
that it did not remove them and could not
remove them because the commission did
cot appoint them; and further that they
may hold office until the heads of their
particular departments see fit to remove
them.
These last two contentions are in the
complaint only by Implication. The case
Itself Is based solely upon the immunity
of the county offices. Starting with the
Idea that charters can do no more than
the Legislature allows them to do, the
plaintiff's attorneys find that the consti-

election of county officers, and to desig
nate the number of their deputies or em
ployes and the compensation of these em
ployes, but that is as far as it goes.
There is no mention made of how these
employes shall be appointed, and so In
formation is sought in another part of the
constitution which directs that the em
ployes of a department shall be appoint
ed by the head of that department in
county offices, and that the appointing
power shall be the removing power. That
is the gist of the case.
The suit is the result of an agitation
among all the employes of the hall. Gar
ber. Creswell and Garber, and George D.
Squires and J. C. Campbell are attorneys
in the case.
An application for a temporary injunc
tion restraining tho payment of any more
money on the examination of employes in
county offices was made before Judge
Bahrs. He granted the temporary -writ
and made it returnable before Judge Heb
bard, before whom the casÂ« will be tried
on the 19th inst. ,
Late yesterday afternoon the Board of
Civil Service Commissioners was Berved
with the temporary order, which will re
strain It from holding examinations as
advertised for clerks in the offices of tho
Assessor, County Clerk, Sheriff, Recorder
and Coroner. The Commissioners held a
meeting last night and a resolution was
adopted recognizing the service of the re
straining order and postponing the exam
inations for clerks in the offices men
tioned. The examination for Assessor's
deputies was set for this afternoon. The
next examination Â¦will be that for expe
rienced clerks in the Board of Public
Works, on next Friday afternoon in the
Girls' High School.
On account of the issuance of the re
straining order the Commissioners will
not employ at the present time the three
clerks which the Supervisors authorized
them to employ to j carry on the work of
the examinations scheduled. V-l';:7

It Is possible to.say concerning the^ horri
ble farrago drawn from Sienkiewlcz's hor
riblo novel.
The play is a melodrama of the cheap
est and crudest kind, based upon an ap
peal to the Igrnorance of those who get
their history from third-rate authorities
and who take their God, with Kipling's
Tomllnson, from a printed book. It is
Irreligious and Immoral throughout, for
the characters with whom you are ex
pected to,sympathize are constantly talk
ing about a divinity who could prevent
Christians from beins impaled like Malay
fireflies, but who doesn't.
One might fill a column detailing the
horrors that are in this play and that
should not be there. To mention only a
few: "We have . an attempted seduction,
drunken men and women pulling one an
other around the stage, roaring lions and
unwashed noblemen. Among the farcical
elements (Intended to be serious) we have
a Christian pauper walking Into the Em
peror's palace as If he were a welcome
guest; a Pretorian guard .that doesn't
move a finger while its captain is being
murdered by an unarmed Christian, and
an Empress who proclaims In stentorian
tones to a roomful of people the details
of a conspiracy she is hatching.
But of all the absurdities in the play, the
most absurd is the ending. This could
eaBily have been made convincing if Vinl
cius had been allowed to stab Nero, as he
was on the point of doing. Instead of
this we are asked to believe that Nero,
after being momentarily frightened into
forgiving his enemies, will allow them to
retire to Sicily, where they are to live
happily ever afterward.
The fact is that the Jurisdiction of a
Raman Emperor Â¦was the known world
and in no part of it. from the Rhine to
the Indies, could a subject of his live hap
pily or live at all if the Emperor wished
him to die. The only alternative was to
kill the Emperor, and that is Just what a
man In Vinidus* position would have
done. Had he done this, though, he would
have acted like a rational human being
and would therefore have been out of

you w31 have paid $240 and at the
end own no piano.
If you rent a fair piano at $3 a
month and keep it for five years, you
will have paid $300 and at the end
own no piano.
But -if you get a good brand new
piano (guaranteed by the manufac-
turers), valued at $300. from Sher-
man, Clay & Co. on their new rent
contract plan, and pay $6 a month
for 62 months, you will have paM
$375 a pd at end of that time the
piano is j-ours.
Don't you think it better to pay
$1.25 a month for the use of the
piano- than $3, $4 or S5? 3EkI
Note â For obvious reasons the
sale of pianos on this new rent con-
tract plan is confined to the cities and
suburbs where the stores are located.
