The candidate for Vice President bowed
continually to the multitude and shook

around his carriage.

enough in favor of the work they accom-j
plished. He is feeling in the best of spir

the boat that has beaten the world's rec

the fact that if the 'conditions of the past
week had continued until to-day an aver
age speed of 17& knots would have been
made. One of the officers aboard jocu
larly stated that "Scott had Cramps!"
.The* spend of the engines was so' regular
that in 13,930 revolutions there was not a
difference of twenty revolutions between
the port and starboard propellers as the
figures stood. It was a* most remarkible
trip. The tidal corrections when com
puted will add to the speed recorded be
cause the tide was against for a greater
length of time than with the direction of
the ship. After the course was run she
did not slack her speed, but kept, right en.
The naval board then took charge of her,
testing the evolutions that are required
by the Government, consisting of turning
to port and starboard in the ordinary
manner. Time was noted at each turn,
also with one propeller bearing ahead and
the other astern, turning to port and star
board with hand 3teering gear and de
scribing a circle. She accomplished so
small a circle that the radius was within
one and, a half lengths of the boat.

NEW UNITED STATES BATTLESHIP WISCONSIN. WHICH DURING HER TRIAL TRIP IN SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL YESTERDAY BROKE THE
WORLD'S RECORD FOR VESSELS OF HER CLASS, ALTHOUGH THE VOYAGE WAS MADE AGAINST THE TIDE AND IN RATHER HEAVY
WEATHER. â¢
SANTA BARBARA. Oct. 1Lâ The
new battleship Wisconsin, in her
trial trip to-day, showed marvel
oub 6peed, breaking all records
for vessels of her class. The
water was rough and a heavy fog hung
over the channel. Hundreds of people
stood on shore to watch the maneuvers
of the vessel, but a few minutes after
she left her moorings she had disappeared
in the white mist.
With the break of dawn a strong,south
west breeze sprung up. The water was
choppy and there was a heavy swell.
Much speculation was indulged in and the
wise ones said the trial must needs be
postponed. The builders, however, were
confident of the staying qualities of their
handicraft and decided to make the run
in spite of wind and weather. They made
it and now proudly point to the mountain
of Iron and steel as another monument
to Pacific Coast skill ar.d enterprise.
A. few minutes before S o'clock this
morning the "Wisconsin left her berth In
this channel and proceeded to sea. She
went far above- the- coureÂ«--Â»ind then rui i
down almost as f a-r as Ventura at v a ,
speed In excess of sixteen knots. On re
turning she started on the course, pass
ing the Iowa, which was the eastern bea
con line, at 10:20 o'clock.
At 11:01 a. m. she passed the first stake
boat, and at 11:31 a. m. passed the second
stakeboat, and shortly after turned the
last stakebcat, the Philadelphia, and re
turned to the starting line. The average
revolutions of the propellers on the west
ern trip were 119.34 per minute and on the
eastern trip 119.15. This is alone remark
able, as never before have average revo
lutions been so close.
The average steam pressure was
180 and the exhausts blew off fre
quently, which, showed that there
j was steam to spar?. The maximum
I speed from the stakeboat Ranger to
Gaviota wharf was 18.54. The aver
age speed for 32 knots on the west
ern course was 17.9, making an aver
age speed for the entire run of 17.25.
All the evolutions of the ship in turn
ing, backing, full speed ahead, full
spezd astern, turning by hand steer
ing gear and raising the anchor with
103 fathoms of c?iain were performed
satisfactorily. All the auxiliaries
performed their work as perfectly
as mechanism can be made to do.
Irving M. Scott said: ""Without
doubt she is the most perfect ship in
all appurtenances that the Union
Iron Works has ever turned out.
Approximately the horsepower was
11,800. The Alabama was the only
other ship that approached the speed
and her average speed was 17.03.

MEMORANDUM.
In the demand cf Li Hung Chang for
the return of the $278,000 seized by the
American marine* at Tientsin, the au
thorities see the purpose of the Chinese
commissioners to offset the claims for
indemnity to be made by powers by coun
t<-r claims for damage to private and
Government property which was not in
accord with the rules of war. There is
no intention on the part of this Govern
ment to participate in any further mili
tarjÂ» expeditions, and It will deprecate
action of this character' on the part of
inreigii powers.
Minisur Wu Ting Fang asserts there 13
r.o danper of an uprising In Southern
<rina, and has so assured Secretary Hay.
The authorities fear, however, that un-
U-ss something is quickly done to support
the rÂ»OKition of the viceroys who have so
nobly held their people in check an out
break may occur. It is proposed by this
Gn\err.ment to insist that the Viceroyg
receive an appropriate award for their
conduct.

LONDON, Oct. 11.â Sir Thomas Lipton

"It is a fact that I control to-day prac

I have "o Intention of raising the price

"Our oppomnts became ashamed of the

They champion thorn still, but they don't

to make a new Issue and that Issue is the
dishonor of the American Hag. And al
ready they loallze that, their choice of a
paramount issue was unfortunate: that
the people stand loynl now, as they stood
when in 1884 Republicans and Democrats
stood Hhouldcr to shoulder and upheld
Abraham Lincoln. And already they are
shifting their issues,, already they recog
rtlzo what a hollow sham if Is to talk
about imperialism, and now they, are do
ing that worst 6f evil deeds- in. a repub
licâpreaching the doctrine of envy, of
class hatred, striving to stir up brother

class against class. Woe to the man who
preaches such a doctrine to our people!
Woe to the man who appeals to and ex
cites the base and foul passions that lurk
in mankind as wild beauts lurk in a jun

the passions; -once aroused it is another
matter to quell them. Danger of Imperial

until our people, are foolish enough to al
low anarchy, mob violence to take the
place of that orderly liberty under the law
which wevhavo inherited as , the most
precious, heritage from our -fathers who
went before us. There comes the only
danger to the permanence and stability of
our institutions^ We can make this Gov

countrymen, if only we will do it hard
enough tj And I appeal to you for fearless
justice, giving it to and exacting it from
all men. Mr. Bryan 1 said the- other day
that we were concerned only about money
and not about human liberty. Has Mr.
Bryan not yet had time to turn his eyes
to North and South Carolina? He was
greatly concerned , over the imaginary
wrongs of a Tagalo'banditshooting at our
men in the Philippines. Let him be con
cerned over tho real wrongs of our
brethren of duskier people, some of whom
fought beside you Inthe great war; some
of whom. I saw, charge at Santiago and

what he said and a comparison of what
has actually happened. He said that un

would stand idle and he has had mure

in the business world would Increase and
they have been but one-tenth as numer

Scheme Adopted Whereby it Was
DEMOCRATS AS RECRUITERS.
At the time of the arrest of some of the
students Mr. Bryan's attention was not
called to the fact, and he did not know
of It until after the close of the meeting.
When informed of what had been, done he
immediately sent the following telegram:
"'If it is true, as I am informed, that
some of the college boys were arrested
for disturbing the meeting, please* ask for
their discharge. I am sure it was the re
sult of boyish thoughtlessness, and not
of malice."
Mr. Bryan took up the trust question at
the beginning of his speech and asked:
"Are you willing to defend ,a system by
which a few men control a great branch
of industry and sell to the people at trust
prices, buy of the people at trust prices
and then employ labor on such terms and
conditions as the trust may fix? You
young men do not want that kind of gov
ernment. You don't want a government
that can punish ahorsethlef but cannot
punish a trust magnate, do you? That Is
the kind of government you have now." '-
Mr. Bryan was asked about the Ice trust
and the cotton/ bale trust" and made his
usual reply. A.volce asked what he would
do about trusts, and Mr. Bryan replied:
.".We have a remedy, and our remedy Is.
first, to put every trust-made article on
the free list; .second, we propose that
Congress shall provide that before any
corporation does business outside of the
Stntc of Its origin it shall takeout a li
cense from the Federal 'Government, and
this shall Only be. given when the corpora
tion shows that it has.no water in Its
stock . and that It Is not attempting to
monopolize "any branch of business. I be
lieve that that would be a remedy for tho
trusts. I believe that no private monop
oly could exist."
By the time Mr. Bryan concluded the
confusion had ceased almost entirely, and
he closed amid cheers.
"The Democratic party is for the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
without waiting for the consent of any
other nation."
"If I were an imperialist," Mr. Bryan
twent 'on, "I would call out an army to
suppress you, but I am not."
-This sally seemed to please the, young
men, and most of them laughed and
Jeered. Some of them jeered to such an
extent, f however, that a policeman was
1 compelled to enter tbo crowd and arrest
several of the noisiest. After this, how
ever, while the Interruptions were fre
quent they generally took the shape of
questions. One brought out this specific
declaration from Mr. Bryan: '
\D3mocrats Are for to r."/.' ; *
ANN ARBOR. Mich., Oct. 11.â Much dis
order characterized "\V. J. Bryan's visit to
Ann Arbor this afternoon. The students
of the State University, which Is located
here, were at the meeting in large num
bers, and each one made his presence felt.
A platform had been erected beside the
courthouse, and the whole side of the
â¢square and street was packed with hu
manity, a majority, of ; those nearest the
stand being students. .'
Mr. Bryan had no sooner shown his face
than the boys began a clamor, which did
not cease t'or ten or fifteen minutes. Even
after Mr. Bryan advanced to the front of
the stage the din continued, but It ulti
mately subsided sufficiently to allow him
to begin. â¢ .
"I am glad to talk to you," he began,
"if you are willing to listen.
A few voices responded: "We are will

Charges have been filed and evidence Is
In the hands of the authorities which, it
is claimed, will show that the magis
trates have been guilty of the grossest
corruption and malfeasance In office. One
magistrate was recently suspended on
suspicion of criminal abuse of power and
attempt to defraud.
The monthly collection of fines of the
four native Justices is estimated at $6000.
The amount- collected by the primary
courts for the same period Is much great
er. The eight magistrates persistently ig
nore the regulations established by the
authorities for the supervision of commit
ments and the accountability of money*
They deposit less than $100 monthly, and
all are anxious to appropriate the balance
of their collections. â¢
It is further claimed that the magis
trates are in collusion with the native po
lice In compromising offenses on the basis
of "cash for freedom." and that- In many
instances magistrates who committed men
to Jail over a year .ago are now liberating
them without trial, the explanation being
the effectiveness of a Hfebeas corpus and
the designation of a special officer to In
vestigate the cases, resulting in the free
dom of many persons illegally committed
as prisoners. It is said there are over
fifty established Instances where prison
ers have bought their freedom from the
guards conveying them between the court
room and the Jail; : '

MANILA, Oct. 6. via Hongkong, Oct. 11.
The administration of Mania's civil
courts by Filipino magistrates. Which has
long been scandalous, is now attracting
public attention more than ever7*and haa
been brought to the Taft commission's
attention with requests for rectification.
The courts are composed of four Justices
of the Peace "and four primary courts.
The magistrates are all Filipinos, and de
velopments have proved that the Incum
bents are utter failures as administrators
of justice. The dissatisfaction with and
complaints against the existing courts are
unending. Natives and foreigners dread

"PRETORIA. Oct. 1Lâ An engine with a
truck conveylnga party of engineers be
longing to Paget's Rifle Brigade, while
proceeding yesterday to Kaapmuidln, was
ambushed by Boers. Captain Stewart,
with forty men of the Rifle Brigade, went

Expulsion of Americans.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL., WASHINGTON, Oct. 1Lâ Prompt
action has been taken, by Secretary Hay
lo call Great Britain to account for the
expulsion of American citizens from the
Transvaal. Inquiry at the State Depart
ment developed the* fact that immediate
ly upon learning of the action of the Brit
ish Government, Secretary Hay sent cablo
Instructions to Embassador Choate, di
recting him to make an immediate repre
sentation on the subject to Lord Salis
bury. In compliance with this instruc
tion. Mr. Choate saw Mr. Salisbury, and
an Inquiry will be made by the British
Government to ascertain the facts.
The authorities are satisfied from the
attitude of Great Britain throughout the
entire South African war that she u dis
posed to be just, and If Americans were
hurried from the Transvaal In the way
they described, no doubt is expressed that
she will make adequate reparation with
out any extended discussion. It is nat
ural, according to officials, that she should
desire to Institute a full Investigation, and
the Government has no disposition to urge
action until she has concluded her In
vestigation. This was the course in the
matter of the flour seUures, and would
be the course this Government would
pursue In case Great Britain had made
similar representations to It.
It is considered likely that thÂ« British
officers responsible for the expulsion ot
the eight Americans will claim that they
were belligerents, as they were compelled
to sign an agreement that they would not
take up any arms against the British or
enter into conversation regarding the
war. -;â¢
In a IÂ§tter written by Secretary of State
Seward to the American Minister to
France, he declared that "a belligerent la
responsible to neutrals for capricious and
wanton Injury inflicted on their persona
and property/' And It Is likely, therefore
that the British Government will be called
upon to pay satisfactory Indemnity unless
it can prove that the Injured Americans
were really In arms against Its forces.

PECULIAR METHODS OF

That the Civil Service Commission must
have a peculiar method of marking ex
amination papers known only to itself is>
demonstrated by the percentage given to
Frank E. Madden, who stands fourth on
the eligible list of Sheriff's bookkeepers.
In this examination MacWen was awarded
SI. 5 per cent. He was successful also in
the examination held for ordinary clerks
some two months ago and was immediate
ly certified for a position in the Reg
istrar's office. Madden had only served
a few days when Registrar "Walsh was
obliged to dismiss him for incompetency.
Chlef Examiner Moran in trying to ex
plain that Madden's percentage In the
bookkeeping examination Was regular
said that Madden lost his position in the
Registrar's office because he misspelled
words and that spelling would not enter
into bookkeeping. Madden was afterward
allowed to take the examination for book
keepers with the astonishing' result men
tioned. He Is now employed by Nathan,

Another official act of the commission
which is exciting- much unfavorable crit

charges that he had falsified in stating
his; former occupation. These charges
were proven by his own â¢'admission and

EXGINEER MEETS DEATH AS

3JEPOBT OP GENERAL
DAVIS IS MADE PUBLIC
Defamation of . character will , form the
basis of a suit for $50,000 damages to be
brought by H. R. Duffln, agent of the
Cape Nome Steamship Company, against
Adolph Ottinger, ticket broker at 620 Mar
ket street. The papers have been drawn
up . by Mr. Duffin's counsel. Martin
Stevens, and will probably be filed to-day
or to-morrow.
Duffln is a member of ' the Guarantee
Ticket Brokers' Association, while Ot
tinger belongs to the American Ticket
Brokers' Association. Before coming to
San Francisco Duffln was connected with
the American Association at Los AngeleÂ».
Ottinger, it is claimed, sent out a "stuf
fer" to sound the market. Duffln replied
and being all out of- the Guarantee As
sociation's blanks he took one of the>
American blanks, scratching out "Ameri
can" and substituting "Guarantee." Ot
tinger sent the blank to the secretary of
the American Association, whose head
quarters are in Chicago, together with a
personally written letter, the contents of
which Duffln now takes exception to and
bases his claim for damages on. .
The Chicago secretary happened to be
friendly with Duffln and he very con
siderately forwarded Ottinger's letter to
him. He read itâ first with surprise, then
with indignation. The things which Ot
tinger put in black and white, Duffln says,
are mean fabrications, intended to injure
his character.
Mr. Duffln declined to talk about the
case when seen yesterday, stating that it
would be time enough to bring out the
facts after suit had been brought.

MANY HALF-ORPHAN CLAIMS.
They Are Causing an Enormous
Drain on the State Treasury.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 11.â The drain on
the Etate treasury for the support of half
orphans is becoming enormoua. The total
amount paid to the counties for the sup
port of half-orphans for the six months
ending June 31 last reached JS1.7C7 53.
Secretary Kevane says he is doing his
utmost to pruard against the presentation
of fraudulent claims. There were in hisj
office back claims from the counties ag
gregating about {175.000, which the board
had "held up ' and refused 10 pay on the
ground that they had been contracted be
fore the present administration took of
fice and their correctness could not J>e
established. Alameda County has begfin
pult to recover its claim, amounting io
f*>me $3"00. and other counties' threaten
similar action.
Mr. Kevane says It can readily be shown
by a tabulated statement that the ex
panses of the eupport of half-orphans is
borne unequally by the counties. He
holds that the counties themselves should
attend to their own charities and believes
that if this were done there would bu
more rigorous inquiry on the part of Su
pervisors and less probability of fraudu
lent claims.

Bundle of Letters Taken From the
Bag Containing the Lompoc
Mail as It Lay on a Truck
at San Luis Obispo. '
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
/ SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. 11.â A mail bag
was looted last night at the Southern Pa
cific depot. The act was most audacious,
as.it. must have been committed, under the
very eyes of a number of people who were
at the depot awaiting the arrival of the
southbound train, which Is due to arrive
at 6 o'clock. When the mall sacks left
the express wagon In which they had been
taken to the depot they were all right,
but when they were again handled to load
on the train it was discovered by the mail
clerk on the train that the sack contain
ing the Lompoc and way mall had been
cut open. When the mall arrives at the
depot from the postofflce It is loaded on a
truck until the arrival of the train. It
was taken to the depot about ten minutes
before train time, but the train was about
half an hour late, and the act was com
mitted during the forty minutes It was
on the truck.
An examination shows that but one
small bundle of letters was taken, but
that does not make the act any the less
audacious. ; The authorities have been
constantly at work, but so far they have
found no trace of the thief.

THE openingr of the regular season
at the California Theater will be
gin next Sunday afternoon with
the presentation of a "new. novel
and mystical comedy" entitled "A
Hindoo Hoodoo." to be given by/ the %VhIt
ing & Willis company of comedians,
which includes .clever Anna Boyd, Mattle
Lockette. George Larsen and others.
"A Hindoo Hoodoo," to put it briefly,
is a sort of transcendental mix-up, in
which an amateur mahatma, after suc
cessfully assisting at the transmigration
of two masculine souls to another and
better land for a short season, forpcts the
recipe when the celestial adventurers'
earthly ticket-of-)eave has expired but
remembers enough to succeed finally in
returning the wandering souls to the
wrong bodies. The complications, of
course, are endless and the possibilities
unlimited, and it is understood they have
been taken fullest advantape of by the
author of "A Hindoo Hoodoo."
Miss Boyd is happily cast as the wife of
one of these gentlemen who lead a double
life in spite of themselves.

MAXWELL E. LONG, a student
at. Columbia University, is the
fastest runner on top of earth.
He pioved his title last week on
the old Guttenburg racetrack,
when, under the sanction of the Amateur
Athletic Union, he made a trial against
the world's record of 47% seconds for 440
yards, made at Beacon Park, Boston. In
1SS6, by Wendell Baker of Harvard. The
trial was suggested by New York Athletic
Club officials after 'Long had beaten Lon
Myers' circular track record of 4$% sec
onds for the distance.
In thÂ« trial he was paced by W. D. Ed
jvards of the Pastime Athletic Club, who
was set ten yards ahead. 'In the New
York World was given the following de
scription of the trial:
"Ready," cried Starter G'anninl. There
was a half-second of intense expectancy,
then the pistol flashed and the two run
ners bounded away like hunted stags.
Long got into his stride at once, his head
hold well up, his nturdy body slightly for
ward, his long legs flying In great leaps,
the knees thrown well up and reaching
out as if to devour space..' Edwards ran
well, but beforv he had traveled one hun
dred yards Lonjj had passed him as a lim
ited express passes a coal train.
The intention^ was ~ to ha Ve^ Edwards
"carry" Long half the distance,, but the
champion lost him so soon that he ran at
lea.st 120 yards alone. Then, at the 220
yard mark, ho picked up P. J. Walsh of
the New York Athletic Club, who. was to
pace him through to the end.
Long's stride seemed as long and high
and free as ever, but he did not pass
Walsh. The pacemaker kept a half-stride
In advance of the Â»hamplon. and as he
ran he kept saying: "Now, Maxey. let her
go; it's only a few yards further. Let
her go!"
Maxey needed no encouragement. He
dashed along with as beautiful a stride
and as fine a judgment of distance as the
athletic world ever saw. He went past
the 350-yard mark in 36 2-5 seconds, com
ing within one-fifth of a second of the
world's record. Then ho let out a few
links of speed and traveled the next fifty
yard8 as if hi3 whole effort were made
right there. It was a marvelous burst of
speed.
The â¢ crowd yelled and shrieked. No
such running had ever been seen since
mankind learned to travel on two legs.
Like an arrow or a bullet sped tne cham
pion. He passed the 400-yard mark in
42 1-5 seconds. In other words, he ran
his seventh stretch of fifty yards uphill
In 5 4-5 seconds, a feat marvelous and un
paralleled.
This great effort tired Long a littla.
His mouth opened, his head went back n
trifle, and for a fraction of a second his
legs seemed to waver. But it was only
for a moment. He gathered himself in
stantly and ran out the, last forty yards
In 4 4-5 seconds.
He. was going strong as 'ever and hÂ«
madÂ© half a dozen strides before he began
to slow his speed. Then' he easily pulled
up and stood there panting and smiling,
while all the athletes and good old has
beens ran at him and yelled and 6lappea
him on the back and put necklocks on

! Free with next Sunday's
CalLsuch as has seldom If ever before been
seen in the bay of San Francisco. From
the Pacific-street wharf and adjacent ones
almost eve*~- one responded to the flutter
of the flags on board by waving handker
chiefs. A long, shrill blast from the
steamer's whistle as she passed out of
view of those on the wharves w#s "good
by all" from those who had started on
a round of uninterrupted pleasure that
has been programmed for sea and shore.
Before 9 o'clock In the forenoon the pil
grims wended their way to the steamer
to arrange their belongings in the quar
ters assigned to them. Then came hun
dreds upon hundreds to bid them a fond
farewell and to take a daylight view of
the ship and its -rettily decorated cabin
and dining salon. A feature that attract
ed the attention of the visitors was that
the emblem of the Shriners appeared on
almost everything in sight. It was even
painted on the panels of the. pianos. Ev
ery pilgrim wore a white cap with gold
braid, with the scimitar and crescent on
the front, while the members of the com
mittee wore a red badge, at the end of
which was a piece of rope, emblematic of
the injunction which is whispered into
the ear of the novitiate as he enters the
temple of the Shriners. In the dining
hall were great floral pieces that added
to the charm of the place. For a time it
was hurry and bustle on all sides on the
decks, a rush and a crush to reach friends
and relatives to say a last farewell. That
was kept up until the whistle sounded
the warning to all who Â¦were not of the
pilgrims to go ashore. As the gang plank
Â¦was drawn some one threw a rope to Po
tentate R. L. Hurlbut with the injunction,
gramme for the first day will give an
idea of the character of the musical treat.
Afternoon â Overture, "Orpheus"- (Offenbach);
Spanish Intermezzo, "Salome" (Loraine); con-

of course, has a set of competent officers

OWNERS THE PERSONS
THAT SHOULD BE ABBESTED
Real Â¦ estate agents who were arrested
for violating the new "cellar" ordinance,
aimed chiefly at prohibiting Chinese from
sleeping in cellars and basements of
houses in Chinatown,: appeared before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday. They are John
Fairchlld. J. T. Hannes. H. W. Stowe. L.
C. Babln and W. J. Laeza. They were
represented by Attorneys J. C. Campbell,
G. D. Shadburne and John G. Bennett.
The point was raised that the owners
and not the agents of. the buildings were
responsible under the ordinance. It was
also urged that the leases had been made
out before the passing of the ordinance,
which .was not retroactive. Attorney
Campbell in his argument alleged that the
Board of Health was overriding the law
in" passing such an ordinance.
The Judge considered the points well
taken and dismissed the cases, but re
marked that his doing so would not Im
pair the validity of the ordinance. He
thought that the men who had personal
control of the houses were the proper per
sons to be arrested.
cently divorced from his wife, got mad
Wednesday night as he brooded over his
troubles and started to drink. The more
he drank the madder he got, and he deter
mined to visit his divorced wife on-Cen
tral avenue and have It out with her for
securing the divorce.
When he reached the house, after 10
o'clock, he found the door locked. He
knocked loudly, but no one answered. He
went to the street, picked up a rock and
threw it at the house. The rock crashed
through a window and struck Miss Ldllie
Knott, a young lady who resides in the
house. The crash 'was heard by Police
men Dunn and Mylar, and they arrested
Holden on charges of disturbing the peace
and malicious mischief. Â» 'Â¦Â¦Â¦>Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The cases were called in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday, but neither the complain
ing witness. Miss Knott, nor the arresting
officers appeared. The Judge continued
the cases till to-day and fixed Holden's
bail at $10 on each charge. '
Holden told the Judge that he threw the
stone at the gate.' It struck the top of
the gate, caromed and went through the
window.

According to an official of the company
the quarantine officer's methods have had
the effect of diverting business to Van
couver. "In addition to this," said th9
official, "mails have been delayed and
local merchants have had to suffer."
The Merchants' Association will also
take up the matter and all of these Com
plaints are likely to be strengthened by
a sharp letter from the Southern Pacific
Company, which has felt to no small ex
tent the ill effects of Kinyounism.
which Is closely associated with the Ma
rine Hospital service.
Chamber of Commerce and British Consul
Will Ask Removal of Quarantine Officer.
"A repetition of the scenes that were
enacted aboard the Coptic must be avoid
ed, and nothing but the removal of Kin
youn will insure reform," said a member
of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday.
"If our committee finds that this man has
overstepped his bounds," he added, "then
we shall not hesitate to demand his dis
missal or transfer by the Washington
authorities." *
The Chamber of Commerce trustees
have taken up the matter at the urgent
request of several i of the members. A
special committee /has been named and
the members are now investigating tho
charges made against Kinyoun. If found
to be true a complaint will be filed with
Surgeon General Wyman of the Marine
Hospital service, from whom Kinyoun
takes his orders. â¢ Â¦
; The British Consul in this city, W. Clay
ton Plckersgill, is also likely to take some
action in the matter. A number of British
subjects who were victims of Kinyoun'a
recent indignities have personally . ap
pealed to the Consul to take a hand in the
affair, and It is understood he has Â¦ writ
ten to the British Â¦ Embassador in Wash
ington, who, in turn, will ' transmit . the
complaint to the. Treasury Department.,
The San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, the Merchants' Association and hi
all probability the British Consul are to
take a hand In the matter of Dr. Kinyoun,
Federal quarantine officer in this port.
Since the recent humiliating episode on
board the steamship Coptic, when pas
sengers were subjected to the grossest In
decencies, the feeling against- the doctor
and his brutal methods has been intensi
fied by complaints from merchants whose
business has suffered by reason "of delays
In the mall, attributed directly to Kin
youn.
KINYOUN'S DAYS ON THE
COAST ARE NUMBERED
Newsboys Restricted.
Newsboys will not be permitted to Jump
on and off street cars in the pursuit of
their daily vocation. At the request of
Secretary M. J White of .the Humana
Society the railroad company has decided
to post notices on their cars prohibiting
the youngsters from endangering their

Hospital bulletins contain the news ot
the weak.
In explanation of why he carried the
revolver with which he did the shooting
Cole says that the night previous he met
a stranger, who, after giving him a knock
out drop, robbed him of $45. . Anxious to
be revenged, he borrowed the pistol from
a friend. Intending to compel the fellow
to give him back his money. After being
released from prison for visiting an opium
joint he went to his room, and, finding
Fallon making love to his female consort,
he called him down. Fallon, he says,
tried to stab him, and in self-defense he
shot his assailant.
Cole will plead self-defense. He claims
that when he accused Fallon of being too
friendly with his female consort his rival
drew a knife and threatened to make him
a subject for the Coroner. Then, Cole
says, he whipped out his revolver and
shot Fallon. Immediately after the Bhoot
lng he left the city, and after some diffi
culty got as far as Yolo, where he stopped
in the Chinatown to purchase some
opium. Detective Fisher had seen him on
the train, and when he learned Cole was
wanted he went after him. finding him In
Yolo, semi-unconscious from the opium he
had been smoking. P'allon was at once
arrested and taken to the Sacramento
jail.
Curley Cole, the opium fiend who shot
and seriously wounded "Tom" Fallon in
"Billy" Abbott's lodging-house several
days ago and was arrested in Sacramento,
was brought back last evening by Detec
tive Harry Reynolds. He was at once
taken to the City Prison and charged with
an assault to murder.
Locks of hair that in the world of art are called Titian, but in army barracks entitle the wearer to the name of
"Brick," soon littered the floor. Occasionally a curl of raven black appeared and not infrequently' a lock of the kind
known as "tow." Bold troopers entered the shop veritable Buffalo Bills and Captain Jack Crawfords in appearance
and emerged greatly resembling a tlcket-of-leave man. The shorn soldiers were a disconsolate appearing lot aa they
sat around the verandas of the hospital, even the tender, svmpathetic words of the nurses falling to cheer them"
"What's the use of being a sick soldier," said one whose head bore a close resemblance to a billiard ball, "if you
can't wear your hair long." Reason for his remark was made evident by the look of pained surprise on the'handsome
face of a young lady who just then appeared in the ward. His only solace was the knowledge that the "other fel
low" in the next ward had been treated likewise. i
All day long the only sounds that were distinctly audible around the hospital were the cry of "Next" and the
monotonous snip of the. shears. With each clip beautiful curls or wavy locks, that had by careful manipulation been
trained to stay "Just so" on the brow of a gallant boy in blue, fell to the floor. As the number of 10-cent "tags" In
creased the look of apprehension on tÂ»ie face of the barber had given way to a. fiendish grin.
"All hands to the barber shop" is the new call now being set to music by the bugler at the General Hospital
Presidio. Early yesterday morning the strange call echoed and; re-echoed through the wards and corridors of the hos-^
pital. When the sound of the last note had died away, strange and startling were the scenes beean to be enacted
From out the various wards issued boys in blue, some on crutches, some on invalid chairs and others being helped
along by their ward masters.
The reason for all this strange parade of sick and wounded soldiers was an order Issued by Colonel Girard that the
patients must content themselves with the amount of hair allowed by army regulations, as the present invalid style of
long hair was "unhealthy and unmllltary-"
"Stand off the barber, but get it cut," said the colonel, and like brave soldiers that they are they obeyed orders.
The lugubrious look on the face of the dusky wielder of the razor and shears was an assurance that the hospital na
tlents were obeying the order literally.
FALLOW DREW A
KNIFE, SAYS COLE
He Declares That His Vic

Him.
The chances of the Risdon Company se
curing a contract for one or more of the
new vessels is considered extremely good.
If the Pacific Ocean is to become an
American ; lake the naval forces of the
Government will have to be increased
many times. It is at present .totally inad
equate and the necessary Increase has to
be drawn- from the Atlantic squadrons.
For this reason it is understood that the
Naval Department is disposed to assist In
building up a strong concern whose abun
dant facilities would not only permit a
rapid construction of vessels, but at the
same time act as a needed competitor to
the strong pretensions ; of the Scotts.
The -Union Iron . Works now, employs
about 4500 workmen and the Risdon Com
pany about 2000. In the event of the latter' s
success in securing * Government con
tracts the Potrero can rely upon an imme
diate Increase to double its present popu
lation.^ . :'Â¦>--.: Â¦ ;.'-'
On November 15, when bids are opened
at the Naval Department. Washington,
for the construction of battleships, cruis
ers and other war craft, the great ship
building concerns of the country will find
themselves confronted with a new and
formidable opponent from the Pacific
Coast. The Risdon Iron Works, the old
est iron manufacturing firm in San Fran
cisco and, Â¦with one exception, the largest,
has had a force of experts at Washington
for some weeks who have been examining
the plans of, the new ships, and the Ris
don Company proposes to submit bids to
secure contracts to construct Just as many
of the new vessels as it is possible to
undertake. The success of the Risdon
Company means much to every interest
on the coast, especially to the. interest of
labor. Every additional ship secures em
ployment of at least a thousand mechan
ics, as 70 per cent of the cost of a Govern
ment vessel is represented by this amount
paid for labor.
By the purchase of the Pacific Rolling
Mills, wltn the thirty acres of ground
covered â¢ by machine-shops, furnaces,
foundries and rolling mills and with a
thousand feet of frontage, on deep water,
the Risdon Company acquired the finest
plant for the building of warships on this
or any other coast. It will make its own
steel castings, no matter what dimensions
they may be, and eventually will erect a
plant for roiring armor-plates by which
it will become independent of Eastern
monopolists. â¢ :" * Â¦
The site of a great drydock has already
been chosen, and the work of constructing
It will soon commence. In a year's time
the present establishment of the Risdon
Company will be abandoned and the men
and works concentrated at the Potrero.
The population of that industrial section
will be more than doubled. :'..,:.

a valuable discussion of the subject by Elwood Mead,
one^of the men best fitted to undertake the campaign
of education needed to bring Eastern people to a
clear understanding of the problem and its impor
tance to the Union.
Mr. Mead points out that laws regulating water
rights must be quite different in the arid regions from
those prevailing elsewhere. Thus he says: "In a
country where streams must be destroyed in order
that people may live the, common law doctrine of
riparian rights so universally recognized in all the
States of the Atlantic seaboard and the Mississippi
Valley has no place. The necessities of climate are
inexorable. Where .crops cannot be grown by rain
fall alone, to insist that streams shall continue to
flow 'undiminished in quantity' is to condemn the
bnds along their banks to perpetual barrenness.. -This
is so contrary to common sense that, with or with
out laws, streams are being appropriated, diverted and
used."
Large districts of country in the arid region have
been settled up without a full understanding -of the
problems of irrigation, and as a consequence there U
now a confusion of laws and rights which seriously
retard the development of the country. Govern
mental supervision will be required to straighten out
the complications and devise a means whereby the
s: reams may be used to the greatest advantage of the
greatest number. Mr., Mead says: "It is now mani
fest that the first step in Western settlement should
have been the measurement of streams and the in
auguration of a system for the recording and protect
ing of rights to their use as complete in its operation
r.s the existing system for the disposal of public lands.
* * * Nothing resembling this has been attempted.
At the outset the whole subject was neglected because
its importance was not appreciated."
It appears that under even the best regulations we
can never obtain from the streams of the arid region
sufficient water to irrigate and reclaim much more
than a comparatively small fraction of the whole
amount of land capable of reclamation were the water
forthcoming. Along every stream there will be tracts
of irrigated and trncts of unirrigated land. The water
will be worth a great deal more than the soil, and
there will be. an immense difference in the value of
lots with water riehti and those without it Thus in

CHANCES FOR Y0T7NQ MEN.
A Foundryxnan Comments on W. J.
Here is an incident that should have been made the
occasion of a sermon on forest preservation and tree
idanting. The people of Wexford have destroyed the
pine forests that gave them wealth and are now about
to destroy the hardwood trees. They please them
sejves with the prospect that the hardwood will last as
long. as the pines, and that, for the present, at any
â¢ ate, their interests are not greatly endangered. â¢ So
long as timber lasts woodmen and farmers will have
work in cutting it down and the revenues derived
from the sale will continue to flow into the county.
After the hardwood is gone there will remain some
thing else for the people to doâ emigrate.
I Had the people of Wexford been wise they wouid
have so managed their pine forests that the last tree
would never have been cut while civilization exists
on this continent. They could have made their forests
a source of perennial revenue, and one that wouM
have increased instead of vanishing with . the 'years.
They have even now a chance to replant the pine lands
while cutting down the hardwood, and thus assuring
the future as well as enjoying the present. . It is safe
to say, however, they will not do, it. In a- few years
Wexford will be, among, the almost treeless counties
of the United States, and then more evils than a mere
lr.ck of woodland and lumber camps will come upon
the community. ?'
It is easy for us toperceivc the folly of Wexford.
but we are about as foolish ourselves. We are wast
ing our woods as fast as mills and fires can destroy"
them. Perhaps the day is not far distant when ' m
some California county the people will gather to see
the last redwood fall/ We are following the path
taken by Michigan, and our pace is rapid. If we are
ever going to halt we should halt now. *'
â¢ By way of explaining the interest taken in the tree
the report goes on to say: "Without a doubt during
the past thirty years Wexford County has produced
as much, if not more, pine lumber than any oflier
county in the State. It has been the principal source
of employment to the residents of Cadillac and the
camps have furnished labor to many of the farmers
of the county during the winter months. It will be
only a short time now until all the pine logs that are
boomed in Clam Lake will be cut, and then will be
gin the cut of hardwood, which promises to be nearly
as 4oiig as the pine has been.!'
A RECENT report from Cadillac/ Michf says:
"The last pine :n Wexford County was cut last
Saturday forenoon at Cumncr .' & Diggin's
camp northwest of the city. What has for so many
years been the chief industry of Cadillac and vicinity
will soon be only a remembrance. This one tree was
left standing for several days in order that photo
graphs of it might be taken. There was' a large
crowd in attendance upon the ceremonies incident V
its destruction. It is said there are three or. four large
pine trees near Harrietta, but they are on the Ann
Arbor. right of way, and therefore are not considered
when speaking of timber cut for lumber."
TjiE END OF" fit FOREST:
The law prescribes how inefficient teachers shall he
weeded from- the department, and the law does not
provide that without trial without public accusation
and _ public examination they shall be thrown prac
tically out of the department although technically
within it. The School Board now recognizes tlm an'
is to be congratulated for accepting what decency in
public affairs demands. : ' r *'
The efficiency of the department was impaired, in
structors were handicapped and the School Depart
ment was fast becoming a field for political trickery,
personal injustice and all the scandal which both en
tail. The Call expose! this outrage upon the schools,
end now the Board of Education has taken the first
Mep to observe honesty in administration. Teachers
are to be advanced by pViority of service, as expe
rience is the first test of efficiency. " They are no
longer lo be made the victims of politically inspired
principals or members of the School Board.
The School Boaid has now placed itself uhqualU
ficdly in support of the principle that there shall be
some stability to the tenure of teachers and that they
shall be advanced in the department strictly in accord
ance with the length of their service. The School
Board struggled hard before granting this evident an-l
or.iy just principle of administration. The bait of
politicians; acting for favor, and of friends, demand
ing: what they had no right to receive, was too tempt
ing, and the present board, under the urging, sugges
tion and leadership of its president, Cecil Mark, vio
lated the wise precedent established by its predecessor
and created consternation and demoralization among
the teachers by taking from them what it had taken
years, to gain.
While the Board of Education shows no inclination
to repair the damage which it has already done to the
department by promoting favorites at the expense of
others, by smuggling teachers into the department at
the cost of those already in, by making instructors
the creatures of the whims and selfish interest of poli
ticians, there is subject for gratification in the fact
that the School Board shows a desire to stop the
spread of demoralization which its political schemes
interjected into the department.
THE Board of Education is to be congratulated
for its decision to remove scandal, injustice and
political and personal favoritism from the
School Department by carrying the priority of service
principle into practical operation and making of re
fcrni something more than an idle promise. The
teachers of the department are to be congratulated be
cause of a victory won for fair treatment and justice
after an expose made by The Call of methods
discreditable and dishonorable on the part of the
Board of Education.

âSt. Paul Pioneer Press. . ;
The lack of any nose-pulling in the Kansas case
renders it less interesting from a personal point of
view than the New York controversy, but when con
sidered as an abstract proposition, without reference
to the incidents that gave rise to it, the question is
one of many fine points. What will be the decision of
the District Court is a matter 'which should not at
this time be subject to newspaper criticism. The press
should not. undertake to dictate to the courts in a
case of that kind. It is, however, safe to say that no
matter what be the decision of the court the Sheriff
will never give occasion for another case of the .kind,
and it is therefore the more important that this one
be settled right.
The lawyers of Kansas have a more complex case
to deal with. It appears the Sheriff of one of the
counties in that State recently allowed a man who had
been convicted of selling liquor without a license to
remain-.with his family instead of serving his time in
jail. At the expiration of the term the prisoner's wife
sued the Sheriff for the price of board and lodging
for her spouse. She was awarded judgment for $21 60.
but the Sheriff has appealed to the District Court.
A claim of that kind was recently made by a trav
eler in the metropolis. He entered the car, deposited
his luggage and then stepped out to "see a friend."
When he returned the seat was occupied by another
citizen. There was first a quiet debate on the rights
of pre-emptors and the ethics of traveling, then an
altercation, then came the nose-pulling, and after thai
came the' charge of assault and battery resulting in
the lawsuit. . r . .
NEW YORK lawyers are just now engaged in the
solution of a law case containing two points.
The first question to . be determined is whether
the deposit of a satchel and a bundle in a vacant seat
in a smoking-car constitutes. a valid title to it on the
part of the depositor against any one who happens to
enter the car while the depositor is out of the seat.
Second, has a man who thus pre-empts a seat a right
to pull. the nose of any interloper who disregards the
satchel and bundle and takes the seat to himself. . ...

UTTERANCE
Equally absurd is the contention of Altgeld that
"the little that comes back does not reach the
masses, but goes to a few syndicates." There is no
such difference of classes in this country as that im
plies. The activity of trade requires the payment of
wages to the workers in all lines of industry- The
profits we have gained from our exports are at once
set to work in this country in the task of producing
more goods. For a man who has the reputation of
Altgeld the Yale address comes surprisingly near
being nothing more than a silly stump speech.
He says "$500,000,000 worth of goods goes abroad
every year in excess of imports and disappears"; that
"we have scarcely anything to show for it." Is it
possible any student of Yale could be deceived by
such a statement? The veriest tyro in affairs must be
awaie that the goods we send abroad arc paid for in
suiie way and that the payment adds to our wealth.
The value of the excess of exports over imports must
be settled by the foreign purchaser. A good portion
of the balance is required to defray the cost of ocean
transportation, and it will continue to be so until we
build up an American, merchant marine equal to the
needs of our commerce, but the rest represents sav
ings in one form or another. It may have come back
to us in American bonds and securities hitherto . helfl
in Europe, or in some other way not noted in the
records of the custom-house, but it comes unfailingly.
\Vei4 it not so we would soon cease to ship goods.
To those who have any memory of the arguments
Altgeld was wont to make when supporting free trade
1-is tirade before the Yale club will appear about the
grossest inconsistency that has been obtruded Â¦ upon
l';e public during the campaign. Altgeld now holds
that the home market is the thing of supreme value,
that it is only by increasing home consumption that
we can get rich, and that the surplus exports abroad
reprtsent property that has been almost completely
wasted and lost.
The collegians of Yale are young and their knowl
edge of party politics is limited, but even the fresh
men among them are doubtless aware that a few years
ago, when the free traders were fighting for control
of the Government, they spoke mockingly of the
home market, clamored for the foreign market, ridi
culed the idea that we could get rich by trading with
one another, and insisted that the only way by which
we could assure prosperity was to tear down the pro
tective tariff and increase our imports and exports,
paying no attention whatever to the claims of work
ingmen for good wages, or to what the free traders
derided as the "supposed" advantages of the home
maiket. , .
The argument of the speaker was that trusts are de
vouring the substance of the people, and that as a con
sequence we are no longer able to consume what we
produce. He is reported as saying: '"Years ago we
had a home market which consumed all of our manu
factured products, and our factories ran day and night.
This home market has been destroyed by destroying
the purchasing power of our people. In proportion to
population our people are not consuming much more
than half what they formerly did. If the purchasing
power of our people were restored to what it once was
this would restore our home market, and the product
of our mills could again be sold at home. Consider
what increased employment and activity this would
give our business men at home! If $500^000,000 worth
more of goods were to be bought by our own people
at home, this would give genuine prosperity. As it 13,
this amount of goods goes abroad every year in ex
cess of imports and disappears. We have scarcely
anything to show for it. And the little that comes
back does rot reach the masses, but goes to a few
syndicates."

j r\ LTGELD of Illinois, who is reputed to carry
j .'/: A under, his hat the brains of the Bryan move
ment, was the principal speaker at a rally of
the Yale Democratic Club on Wednesday evening.. As
he is regarded as the greatest intellectual force. in his
party, and has long had a national reputation, it was
natural the young collegians should look to him for
leadership and enlightenment. It is probable, how-.
ever, they were greatly disappointed by what they
heard. Altgeld gave them a new argument, indeed,
but not one calculated to appeal to the reason of in
telligent people. It was not only weak, f but, coming as
it did from a man who has been for years a free trader
and a free silver advocate, it had all the marks of in
sincerity and demagogy.
flLTGELD'S NEW ARGUMENT.
Speaking of the results that may be expected from
an extensive system of irrigation Mr. Mead says:
"The healthfulness and charm of the arid region, and
the remarkable profits of irrigated agriculture, make
it inevitable that its valleys are soon, to be the home
of a dense population. The time is not far distant
when the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys of Cali
fornia will each support's million -of -people. The
Missouri and, its tributaries will, within the next half
century, irrigate more acres than does the Nile to
day. In order to provide for this, the present hap
hazard development should give way to a system

Two Soldiers and a Civilian
Shot in the City of

HAVANA. Oct. 11.â At Matanzas yes
terday a Cuban policeman Interfered with
two members of the Second United States
Cavalry. The quarrel culminated In a
general. fight between the police and sol

taneously. *After the polico had shot
Trooper Turey of Troon D, one other sol
dier and a civilian, a number of troopers
of .Troop D tried to break into the gun

slightly hurt while endeavoring to quiet
the men. The troops declared that they
will have revenge, and Colonel Noyes has

that there is any respect for Christianity

the Nestorians. the Roman "Catholic mla
sionaries opened the earliest missions in
China and kept Christianity alive through
the middle ages. They will correct their
mistakes of policies if they have made
them, as we will ours, and their faith will
Dr. Stimson added
"The only question that concerns us,"
Dr. Stimson said, "Is Dr. Blodgett's ques
tion. 'Who will follow in their train?' "
Dr. Stimson declared they were nui
there for vengeance nor to say anything
in' regard to the policy of the Government
in China.
Rev. Henry A. Stimson. D.D., of New
York, recording secretary of the American
board, read a letter from Rev. Henry
Blodgett. the first American missionary
in North China and founder of the Pckins
mission. Dr. Blodgett recounted the sui>
ferlngs of missionaries from the recenl
persecutions in China and said:
"This will be an unexampled meeting
of the history of the board. The question
will come, who will follow In their train? *
President Eaton of Beloit College made
an eloquent address. In the course of
which he said the disaster to Christian
missions in China opened up new hope
for the work there. After the ruin, he
said, comes the rebuilding and the board
has the materials for the work in the
Chinese themselves.
Those who spoke were Rev. Dr. C. ah
Stanley. Rev. G. H. Henry Ewing. Rev.
E. A. Atkin. Dr. Willis C. Noble. Rev. I.
J. Alwood. missionaries of the North
China mission; Rev. Henry A. Stimson,
D.D.; President Elward D. Eaton, D.D..
and Rev. Harlan P. Beach.
"Unless all signs fail this day of blood
shed and loss Is sure to be followed by
an immense enlargement of missionary
opportunity in China."
Dr. Smith's paper was followed, by a
general discussion of the subject by mis
sionaries and officers of the board. Among
the missionaries who spoke were a num
ber who passed through the recent Boxer
outbreak in North China and some ot the
hair-raising experiences recounted by
them seemed beyt/nd belief.
Â¦ "I . speak for Protestant missionaries,
and particularly for those of our own
board, when I say that the missionaries
aro not the cause of this outbreak. They
are in China with China's knowledge and
virtual consent, enjoying plainly stipu
lated treaty rights. Cnina has made no
complatnt of them. She has not asked for
a revision of treaties in order that she
might be freed from their presence.
"But missionarlesT^e are told, have no
business in China, forcing a foreign. and
hateful religion upon cne people; their
presence and work naturally arouse re
sentment and hatred. This charge striken
back to one who brought a heavenly glory
to the earth which repatd him with a
cross and a crown of thorns and charged
him with folly and seems to cover witlj,
shame the brightest pages of Christian
history, th.e noblest names upon the roii
of the ages. What is now to be done .*
Are our missions to be closed up and the
work of evangellzlnp Cnina abandoned".
Not unless we have decided to give 'up all
missionary effort. For much as has been
destroyed there Is much more that re
ma'ns. Our two missions in the south are
essentially intact. And in the north there
are still native Christians who have held
their faith, who are now in hiding, but
with peace will come forth to form the
nucleus of the new churches and Chris
tian community. The Bible and Christian
literature and text books remain.
"The doom of the dynasty and of the
anti-foreign policy It embodies is pro
nounced; no diplomacy, no force of arm*
can save them;' the powers, even If tht?y
should wish to prolong their life, will fight
against an Irresistible fate. The future
will reveal a new China and that will be
a new world, with a glorious destiny be
fore it. The mission property, together
with the personal effects of missionaries,
has been destroyed at Tungehow. Pelclnjj,
Kalgan, Paoting and Linching; undoubt
edly everything In Shansi is gone; one
mission rebuilt in Tientsin has brer,
burned; chapels by the score in our sta
tions have been destroyed. The total loss
at a low estimate must amount to hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. For the
loss of missionary life there is no money
value. For the wholesale slaughter of
the native Christians there is also no
compensation. The awful fact that con
fronts us is the death by violence of thir
teen of our missionaries, with five chil
dren, involving the extinction of the
Shansi mission.

Captain Lew Williams, perhaps the best
known of the Arctic whalers, got homo
from Cape Nome a few days ago. He
went north with "Barney" Cogan on the
bark Alaska and lost everything except
a suit of underclothes when the vessel
went ashore. Not a cent's worth of stuff
was rescued from the wreck.
Captain Harry Johnson and Captain
Charles Bruce are also back from the
frozen Xorth. Johnson made money by
turning boatman and carrying gold
hunters to and from their ships in a dory.
Captain Bruce is ahead in experience, but
he expects to make .money next season.
Shipping men had a quiet day on the
front yesterday. There were three ar
rivals â the Fteamer Alcatraz from Port
Los Anseles, the schooner Glen from
Byxbee Landing and the schooner Alex
ander from Needle Rock.
If ever there was a ciaft that has a his
tory the Alexander Is that one. She
came out here from England as a slde
wheelor and did good service, qn Puget
Sound. After her days of usefulness as
a steamer were gone she was sold to the
hlKhcst bidder. T. P. H. Whitelaw of
San Francisco bought the old-timer and
taking the machinery out and the paddle
boxes off, he turned her .Into a. four
masted schooner. The hull is of teak
and sound as a nut. but still the old craft
will leak when under full canvas.
When the Nome excitement was at Its
height a man named Pierson secured the
vessel and put her on tlie run for the gold
fields. A number of women took pas
sage, but the vessel never sailed and a
libel suit followed. In the end the
Alexander was sold and her new owner3
sent her to Xeedle Rock â¢ to load for
Salinas Cruz. The old-timer Is leaking,
but .sailormen say she is perfectly sea
worthy. Still she must be overhauled, as
the men say they will not man the pumps
every hour between here and Salinas
Cruz.
Departing Vessels.
Out of a fleet of twenty craft ready to
fail only seven were able to get away
yesterday. Many of the deep-water ves
sels cannot procure crews and some of
the coasters could not get their cargoes
aboard. The v steam schooner Whites
boro got awafr for one of the lumber

FIVE DOLLARS A BOX.
The Price dut No Figure With Him.
I want to ?ay for the benefit of some
poor dyspeptic that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will give comfort and a cure
every time. Five dollars a box would not
stop my purchasing them should I ever
suffer again as I did for a week before
using them.
The one u0-cent box I bought 'at my
druggist's did the work, and my diges-
tion fs all risht again.
Many of my neighbors have also tried
these tablet3 and found them to be just as
represented, and Mr. Ellms also wants me
to use his name In Indorsing Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. Signed.
A. ELLMS and
CHARLES F. BUZZELL.
Asst. Postmaster. South Sudbury. MaÂ«s.
Mrs. James Karton of Toronto, Can.,
writes: For eighteen months I suffered
from what I supposed was bladder and
kidney trouble, and took medlelr.e from
three different doctors, without any sign
of cure. I felt so ill at last I was hardly
able to do my work.
I thought 1 would try a box of Stuart'*
Dyspepsia Tablets and see if they would
make me feel better, never really think-
ing I had dyspepsia, but after only three
or four tablets had been taken all the acid
trouble disappeared and then I discovered
I had. had acid dyspepsia, while the doc-
tors had been treating me for kidney and
bladder tro.uble. and one of them treated
me for rheumatism.
My digestion is fine, my complexion
clear and I am able to do my -work, and
low spirits are unknown to me.
I am so thankful for finding a cure so
good and so pleasant to take as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. I am surprised at the
change they have made in me.
All druggists sell and recommend Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, because they
contain only the simple natural digestives,
and taken after meals prevent acidity
and cause prompt digestion and assimila-
tion of food.
Physicians everywhere Indorse them be-
cause they are as safe for the child as
for the adult; they are invaluable for
sour stomach, nervous dyspepsia, heart-
burn, gas on stomach and bowels and
every form of stomach derangement.

CHICAGO. Oct. 11.â While there was market
news of various kinds served up to the consid
eration of. speculators In wheat, the market
more than anything else owed its irregularity
and lt was irregularâ to the Instability of sen
timent among small traders. December opened
K0%c higher at 78H0?6%& Paris was firm;
I-Jverpool steady; three mills at Minneapolis
were reported about to ivopen and receipts at
Duluth were light. Sentiment changed, how
ever, and December sold Quickly down to 76VÂ»c.
It recovered to 76%c Just as quickly, and in this
was assisted by the strength of outside mar
kets and buying by the Northwest. Near the
end the usual hoodoo, outside indifference,
made Itself felt, and December 'declined to
75Hc and closed %c down, at 76@:76%c
Corn was iirm and fairly active. December
closed H&Uc higher at 34T4c.
Oats were quiet and the tone easy. De
cember closed Uo down at 22Vic.
Provisions started ttrm on \t\e hog receipts,
which were 8000 under the estimate. A bulge
followed the opening on liberal buying by
those who had sold earlier in the week, but
later the market turned easier in sympathy
with wheat. The close waa steady, January
pork 2V:C lower and ribs .unchanged.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. IIâ The stock market fell |
lr.to a condition approaching stagnation dur
ing the latter nours of the trading. The under
tone was heavy, the dribbling orders finding i
no support whatever. The trading between
the boardroom members made up the whole
market, ani owing to the relative dullness of
the gold market the movement In People's Gas
v,.Â»s made conFriiouous. The pressure against
the stock was continued early in the day, but
the bears, who have eoid the stock continu
ously for some time r-ast. became disquieted
lat^r in the day over the extent of their cora
rriitTr.ents and a vague suspicion that the gas
war in Chicago was not as unrelenting as waa
made to appear en the surface. The published
rcfjort that the Ogden Company was buying Its
additional equipment from sources dominated
by lntco-yts trlendly to tho People's Gu Com
jiany v. as the cause. FrÂ« m SIS, as the low
point, the stock forged steadily upward to Â£;*Â»,
with cymr>toms of increasing urgency in the
buying demand from the short Interest. The
cic-fc<= was at the highest with a net <raln of
3%. Nothing could more Ftrlkingiy demon
strate the Inertness of the general market than
Its utter failure to respond to this rather sen-
Rational movement. The dullness at the close
was unrelieved and the days net changes were
mixed and entirely insignificant. The money
market thr.werl a rather reactionary tendency,
34 I* r cent representing the maximum rate,
compared with i j*r cent yesterday. Late in
the day the rate ran down to l\ per cent, but
as this r-ame after the principal demand had
hÂ«-en satisfied, it was not considered as a fair
Index of the ruling rate. The movement to
Â»w Orleans and St. Louis was merely nominal.
Foreign exchange also steadied this morning,
but fell away again In the afternoon with the
news that the price of gold In London had
been advanced another haif-'Â»enny an ounce
for both gold ban. and AmcÂ«can eagles. The
rise in gold neutralized the action of the gov
ernors of the Bank of England In retaining
the discount rate at 4 rnr cent. The weekly
return of the bank alÂ«io shows that the failure
to advance the rate Is probably a temporary
policy having consideration for the need of the
home market rather than Indicating a belief
that the demand for gold from New York does
not need further resistance.

FRANCIS E. McMANN, SON OF A MILLIONAIRE, WHO DIED IN THE I
CITY AND COUNTY Â¦ HOSPITA L YESTERDAY OB> CONSUMPTION.
HE WAS PENNILESS AND ALMOST WITHOUT FRIENDS.
A MAN died in the City and Count}
Hospital on Wednesday night last
whose name up to a few hours
before his death was believed by
all but one man to be Frank Wil
liams of nowhere in particular and a vic
tim of Ralloping consumption. Two
months before his death the man confided
to the Rev. Douglas Kelly of the St.
Cornelius Episcopal Chapel, who had
taken an interest in him, that hla true
name was Francis McMann.
At long intervals Williams or McMann
told the priest bits of his life's story. It
was a story of a misspent. career, of an
educated man who nacl become passion's
slave and sunk from bad to worse, ever
lower until a victim of consumption
he had become a pauper inmate or the
City and County Hospital?
As a proof ot his wealthy relationship,
McMann told the Rev. Mr. Kelly of an
uncle Thomas Montgomery, of McGill
street, Montreal, one of that city's moat
prosperous and wealthy merchants. This,
nowever. was the only direct mention he
ever made of being allied to prominent
P *Last July, when McMann entered the
hospital, he came there from Sacra
mento. . He came to the institution to
die. A short but rapid career of wild
dissipation had shrunk his once athletic
form to mere skin and bone and his one
hope was to end his days, If not in com
fort, at least In a certain peace. This
much he confided to '.he Rev. Mr. Kelly.
The day he died, but some time before
dissolution took place, McMann told hio
spiritual adviser that Charles T. Waters,
a clerk in the auditing' department of
Wells-Fargo, knew him well and would
dispatch a telegram to his people, whose
names or business McMann had never
confided to the priest. Waters sent the
telegram, but up to late last night no an
swer had been received. Mr. Kelly sent
a letter to Thomas Montgomery, whom
McMann claimed was his uncle, two
weeks ago, but no answer has reached
Even in their terribly emaciated condi
tion as they look up from a slab in tho
' hospital morgue, JIcMann's features
show a certain refinement and Mr. Kelly
says that he seemed a man above the
ordinary, refined and educated. Whether
the story he told is true or not Is a ques
tion, but there can be no doubt, and in
this the hospital officials agree, that
Frank Williams, pauper consumptive, no
matter what his real name was, was one
who had fallen from an estate, if not
high, at least higher than that in which
he died. The body will, , according: to
custom, be kept three days. In the event
of no claim for it being brought forward
it must lie in the potter's field or becomo
a subject for the dissecting-room. . -
When seen last night â¢ Rev. Mr. Kelly
willingly gave all the Information he had.
"I met McMann," said he. "threo
months ago at the City and County Hos
pital. I- became interested in him and
we frequently held long conversations to
gether. Very rarely, however, did he
offer to throw any lighi on his past life,
but from occasional bursts of confidence
on his part I gathered that his had been

a life thrown away. Young, athletic
and unmistakably well bred. AlcMann has
reaped the whirlwind. Just before he
died he told, me of Waters' friendship for
him and I communicated with Waters,
who telegraphed" to Montreal, but this
message, as was mine to Mr.' Montgom
ery, has up to this time remained un
answered.- I do not know how. much
money he had thrown awayâ some thou
sands, I should imagine. Men do not go
such a pace for a. small sum."

Heavy Wheels of a Truck
Crush Stella Marie
Brissolasa.
Stella Marie Brlssolasa, a child 6 years
of age. came to an awful death under
the wheels of a heavy truck on Mission
road, near China avenue, yesterday after
noon. The little one's head was crushed
beyond recognition, but notwithstanding
her horrible injuries, she lived fully fif
teen minutes after the accident occurred.
The girl's brother. Nicholas, one year her
senior, made a heroic attempt to rescue
his sister and was himself seriously in
jured. The body was taken to the
Morgue.
About 3 o'clock Â¦ yesterday afternoon a
number of children were frolicking along
the Mission road. Some of them amused
themselves by jumping on passing vehicles
and when a heavy truck, drawn by four
horses and driven by Ed O'Malley, came
alonpr. both Xicholas and his sister
climbed on one side of it. The truck was
running alone the railroad track, and as
a car approached the driver attempted
to pull the vehicle to one side of the
street. The boy Jumped to the ground,
but a sudden jar threw the little girl off.
Nicholas Instantly made a desperate at
tempt to save hla sister, and succeeded
in pulling her almost clear of the big
wheels. He did not act quickly enough,
however, and one of .the rear wheels
passed over the girl's head, crushing it
to a pulp. Young Nicholas slipped and
injured his arm.
O'Malley was arrested and taken to the
Sixteenth-street police station. The child
resided with her parents at 6 Cayuga
street.
DEATH CLAIMS SLEEPING
LASS AND LITTLE CHILD
Jennie Gibney read her prayer boolc and
told her roaary beads last Wednesday
night before she went to sleep for the last
time, and when morning's light came ghe
lay cold and white In death, the string of
beads twined around her fingers and tho
prayer book in bod at her aide.
Miss Gibney was 19 years old. She went
to work last Monday as a servant In the
family of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Schanzer,
1129 Pierce street. At a quarter before t
o'clock yesterday morning Miss Jessie
Schanzer went to her room to awaken
her. The door was slightly ajar and the
room was full of gaa.
The theory of suicide Is not entertained
by Miss Glbney's friends. They say that
she was an unobtrusive young woman of
deep religious convictions and had no
troubles, fancied or real, that would im
pel her to take her own life. Their theory
Is that she went to sleep with, the sraa
burning and that the jet was extinguished
by a sudden draught through the partly
open door or by a diminution, of pressure
in the pipes.

San Francisco Firm Locates
on Alameda Side of
Estuary.
â¢ Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Oct. 11.
Ten acres of marsh land on the Ala
rm-da side of the estuary have heen pur
chased by the United Engineering Works
nf Baa Francisco as a site for a ship
building plant. The location .Is opposite
Adams' wharves, east of the Harrison
street Southern- Pacific railroad bridge,
lne company has made some minor Im
provements on the solid land in the pur
chase, but before building extensively will
be compelled to do much fULlus.
The purchase is a significant one, as in
dicative of the future development of the
frontapo on both sides of the estuary and
Oakland harbor. The management of the
works, while confirming: the report of the
purrhaw, isÂ» not ready to announce Its
plans In detail with relation to the exten
sive acquirement. The site ia large
enouph for big enterprises. Manager
Christie said:
"We will follow the same lines of busi
ness here that we have in njHTation in
San Franripco, namely, ship Uuildinp. and
marine machinery construction. At pres
ent It is not contemplated that anv work
of Kieat magnitude will be done 'at the
new location.
â¢â¢Tin- estuary is in a position to become
a prcat center for the ship buildinp in
dustry and to be a port of larpe mari
time development. The land we pur
chased, while not for immediate use, can
be ft cured now much cheaper than a few
years henrp."
The T'nlted Oil Producers' Company has
secured a site on the Alameda marsh
near \\ ebster-street bridge, where a
crude oil storage plant is being installed
The oil will be used by the electric lines
of Alameda, Oakland and Berkeley as
well as by other establishments which
are to substitute the oil for coal.

NEW YORK, Oct. ll.-The Westchester
lightweight handicap was the feature of
a good day's racing at Morris Park to
day. - Alard Scheck, the Western two
year-old, won It in commanding style,
giving weight to a lot of good sprinters
of the older division. A big crowd was
on hand, attracted by the clear weather i
and good card. Eight horses faced the J
starter in the chief race of the day, and
Meehanus closed favorite at 3 to I, with
Alard Scheck, Musette and Belle of Lex
ington about equal second choices. There
was a tiresome delay at the post, but
they were finally sent off in fair order.
Shaw rushed Musette out to make the
running; and she led by three lengths
around the far turn and into the stretch,
with Meehanus and Belle of Lexington
next, i The fast pace told on all three and j
they were passed in the stretch by the
rear division. Alard Sheck coming through
with a great burst of speed and winning
cleverly by a length from Rush, with old
Klnniklnnic third.
In the first race Unmasked came down
the last five and a half furlongs of the
Eclipse coarse in l:03V4 within a half sec
ond of the world's record for the distance.
Unfortunately he nearly touted Silver
dale a sixteenth from home, which re
sulted in his disqualification, giving the
race to Lady Uncas, who was beaten only
by a neck. Henry was fined $50 for his
rough riding. s tl
Snark won the second race easily at
good odds, and Greenock took the New
Rochelle selling race. It was only a three
horse affair, but they finished heads apart,
amid great enthusiasm.
Carbuncle galloped home in the fifth,
and Belgrade, the rank outsider, took the
last cleverly. Summary:
Five and a half furlongsâ Unmasked won.
Lady Uncas second. Sllverdale third. Time,
l:03i*. Unmasked was disqualified toe fouling
and the officials placed the horses: Lady Un

ALARD SCHECK
IS THE WINNER
It seems preposterous to think that the
managers of a fair or horse 6how could
ever again hope to induce breeders or
horsemen to make entries in a show
of this sort. There i3 always an element
of danger involved shipping a valuable
horse or animal of any kind about the
country, and in all Justice the least that
could have been done was to have re
turned the entrance money. When an
entry was made in any particular class it
was done In good faith and the entrance
fee paid without complaint. If the fair
was a frost due to the incompetency of
others exhibitors should not be held re
sponsible, but ought to receive the prizes
advertised, else they should have their
entrance money returned to them. Only
a master of the art of necromancy and
mind-readtntr could have foretold tha
classes in which there would be no com
petition.
Although the fair of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Agricultural Association
recently held at Tanforan Park is a thing
of the past, for this season at any rate,
discordant melodies from unhappy ex
hibitors still permeate ' the atmosphere.
Not the least prominent feature of the ill
starred venture was the bench show, and
intermittent and unearthly howls still
emanate from the kennels, while the
owners of prize canines are beginnine to
fret .and perspire, lest they forever be
held in abeyance.
While only sympathy is extended 'to the
directors of the unfortunate lizzie, who
were forced to stand an assessment of $4
a share, exceratlons a hundred fathoms
deep are the portion of Promoter Edwin
F. Smith. The harness-horse men were
Indignant at the sport being postponed
with the best two days to come and big
crowds assured, and they, too, are en
titled to sympathy. Mr. Smith is said to
have remarked that "not if a big red appla
on the end of a fishing pole and 510,000 in
coin were handed to him" would he -pass
through the ordeal again, and not a dis
senting voice from among his listeners.
According to the conditions, all cash
prizes, bouquets and ribbons awarded by
the Judge of the bench show were to be
distributed the last night of the affair.
Owing to tho empty condition of the
treasury, owners of dogs were asked to
be patient and wait until Saturday. Octo
ber 6. During the Interim each owner of
a prize winner received a postal card
asking which was preferableâ the coin or
a medal. For three days Mr. Smith's
mail consisted almost entirely of postal
cards with the word "dough" written
thereon. Not even the magnificence of
"White Hat" McCarty's Dexter Prince
medal tempted them. Then the "dos
folks" were asked to wait again â this
time until Saturday, October 13. They
are still waiting and it is said another
postponement will be tha occasion for
some "large doings."
The exhibitors of fancy cattle and
blooded horses think they were duped,
and perhaps not without reason. One
owner of a spanking pair of. roadsters
paid $3 to enter his team in a class for
which there happened to be no other en
try. According to the rules published in
one edition of the official catalogue, there
being no competition he was entitled to a
blue ribbon only, the money prize being
withheld. "Talk about trusts," said the
disgruntled horseman. "Wait until the
next horse show comes along, and I'll
have a corner on blue ribbons. A giant
"kick" was also recorded by a breeder
from up country. Entering a magnificent
specimen, of the thoroughbred in one of
the classes for competition, the other en
tries failed to materialize, leaving him In
the "no competition predicament" also,
and the recipient of a third of a yard
of blue ribbon.
Anxious and Weary O-wnera of Prize-
Winning Canines Still Wait

Kicking.

PROMOTER SMITH
At the time of his disappearance "Waite
had been agent of Uie express company
at Ravenna for three- months. He fig
ured that the receipts of the company
for two days would afford him ample
funds for his "eood time." The value of
the property that came to tho oKlce of
the express company during those two
days amounted to about $500. In addition
to this there was a package of uncut cur
rency, en route from the treasury to the
Second National Bank of Ravenna, which
he appropriated. Still there was t> not
enough to afford him a "good time." A
book of blank money orders on the ex
press company was his next piece of loot,
and this, with all the cash taken In dur
ing the two days, he considered enough.
He came to California for his "good
time." After getting rid of the cash
and property, he proceeded to Â¦work off
the money orders. Four of the blanks he
filled out for J30 each and succeeded In
cashing them under the name of Frank
C. 'Gillman. Using various names fnr
that of the cashier of the Second National
Bank, he next cut and floated the. uncut
currency. ' v ._ ; ,
The American Bankers' Association had
been informed of this disappearance ana
placed the case in the hands of the
Plnkertons. C. E. Vannatta. superintend
ent of the Pinkerton jgency in this city,
located the young man at Lower Lake
and arrested him there Wednesday night.
TValte confessed his crime and told
Vannatta that he only wanted to have a
good time. He said he had had It and
then went on a hunting trip. There wa<*
nothing left of the stolen money or prop
erty at tho time of his arrest.

A bold burglary was ' committed in tho
shadow of the new Hall of Justice last
Tuesday morning. The Kearny-street
Exchange at 809 Kearny street, and but
a few steps from police headquarters,
was entered about daybreak by bold
thieves and the contents of the cash regis
ter stolen. The burglar climbed through
one of the transoms above the front en
trance, pocketed his spoils and coolly
walked out Into the street.
-A. couple of months ago the same place
was, visited by thieves, and from the sim
ilarity of the two crimes the police believe
the i same crooks committed both jobs. Â¦Â¦Â¦,
Fred Severs, the proprietor of the sa
loon, closed his place shortly after 3
o'clock on the morning the burglary took
plac,e. About 5 o'clock the crooks ap
proached the place and while one of them
climbed up the front door on rods of iron
that protect the glass, the other is sup
posed- to -have served as a. lookout. The
transom was forced and the thief drew
himself Â¦â¢ over the door. He opened the
cash- register and extracted $25. -He then
threw down the Inner bars from the
swinging doors and walked Into the street.
Two Â¦ months ago the same sort of a
crime was committed and the crooks real
ized $16 for . their work. The â¢ same key
â¢was rung up on the cash register, and the
same means were employed in gaining an
entrance.^ â¢ .Â¦

The bazaar which Is now being conduct
ed in the art gallery of Mechanics' Pa
vilion in aid of the building fund of St.
Brigld's Church Is fast being recognized
as one of the most artistic ever planned
in the city. There Is life and light, music
and color In the old barnlike structure
which has been transformed into a little
palace. There, are dainty things to look
upon, quaint booths "and pretty pavilions.
Pretty girls there are on every side, and
they are working zealously for a worthy
cause. Every night there is a series of
musical entertainments, ambitious and
artistic enough alone to charm people to
the pavilion.
The bazaar therefore is winning a mer
ited success. The crowd last night was
large, notwithstanding the Inclemency of
the weather. The scene, with its lights
and color, its odd and strange booths and
pavilions, its throng of chattering, laugh
ing, gossiping and merrymaking, people,
was a ' brilliant one. Each booth has
something to sell, and all that is there is
well worth buying.'
Those that wish to aid the worthy cause
of the fair may purchase from a score of
counters If they please, and if they do not
they may mingle with the crowds, listen
to the music, inspect the various beauties
of tho fair and share in the festivtles.
One feature of the bazaar which* has been
unusually successful and which deserves
the patronage It has received is the dally
lunch which is served by the ladies of the
parish. . ' j .

ITALIAU" FISHERMEN
STRIKE IN AXASKA
Demand Additional Pay Because
Their Employers Furnish Them
With Rotten Nets.
Eighty-four Italian fishermen from
Alaska created a hubbub in the office of
United States Shipping Commissioner
Bassett yesterday. The men went north
to wcrk for the Alaska Packers* Associa
tion, the shipping articles providing that
they should receive $50 each and 1 cent
for each salmon caught. This the men
wore offerc-a by the association, but they
refused to accept the money, claiming
that they had made a supplemental agree
ment whereby the association had agreed
to pay them $100 each instead of $50 and 4
cents per salmon. They immediately re
tained Assistant United States District
Attorneys Banning and Woodworth to
collect the money and the case will be
taken Into the courts through the medium
of a libel suit against the ship Two Broth-
The men say that when they began the
work cf fishing for salmon in Alaska the
association furnished them rotten nets
through which a large percentage of the
fish broke an<i escaped. As the shipping
crticles guaranteed th^m a percentage on
the Quantity O f salmon caught the men
complained that their time was being
wasted b<-eausp of th<- rotten nets and
they went on strike. The matter was set
tled by the signing by the men and the
fcger.t or the association of the supple
mental agreement. vv
The Case of Grand Larceny Against
INCIDENTS IN POLICE COUBT.
Kitty Turner Dismissed by
Judge Cabaniss.
The case of Kittle Turner, charged with
felony embezzlement for appropriating
"Billy" Abbott's diamond ring valued at
$250', was dismissed by Judge Cabaniss
yesterday because the evidence was con
tradictory and because of the character
of the witnesses against ner. Abbott
threatens to take the case before the
Grand Jury. '
Gus Muldoon and Paul_ Graves, who are
accused of stealing $25 from Domenico
Mancuso. 1320 Natoma street, on Sunday
evening at a "stag" dancing party at hi3
house, appeared before Judge Conlan yes^
terday on the charge of grand larceny.
The cases were continued till Tuesday.
Graves was arrested in 1S97 on three
charges of burglary under the name of
Milton Berry and was sent to Folsom pen
itentiary.
John Curley, who stabbed John Archer.
an ex-prlzeflghter, on Wednesday night
during a quarrel about a woman, ap
peared before Judge Frits yesterday on
the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. His bonds were fixed in $500 and
the case was continued till next Tuesday.
Archie Warner and Abe Canton, two
young men who have been peddling cheap
jewelry and paste diamonds In the neigh
borhood of the Palace Hotel, and who
are accused of carrying on a bunko game
at the same time, were charged before
Judge Mogan yesterday with peddlinsj
without a license. Policeman Ross, who
made the arrests, said the defendants had
been warned several times, but always
returned. One of them, the policeman
said, would quietly drop a paste diamond
or brass watch on the sidewalk while a
stranger was near and pick it up as if he
had found it. He would arouse the cu
pidity of the stranger and sell him the
article at a supposedly cheap price. The
cases were continued till to-day.
IT is the topic of universal comment in
political circles that McKinley Id
gaining strength in every section of
the United States. Clear-headed
Democratic politicians acknowledge
that Bryan's chances of success are rap-
Idly diminishing. The Bryanites ex
pended their ammunition early in the
campaign, and now, when the hardest
fighting Is demanded, Bryan and his chief
followers are exhausted and the McKin
ley reserves are fresh and vigorous.
Even the leading Democratic politicians
say that the country is weary of Bryan
and his fifteen speeches a day and will
turn with a sense of relief to hear what
President McKinley has to say. Every
one who Is posted knows that President
McKinley will say the right thing at the
right time. . %
The Republican State .Central Commit
tee Is receiving cheering messages from
the Interior. Republicans are confident
that McKinley will carry California by a
majority larger than he received In 1SÂ£6.
There are no special developments in
the contest for Collector of the Port.
Senator Bard and family leave for the

two weeks hence. The appointment of Col
lector will not be made until immediately
after the election, but within the next two
weeks Senators Bard and Perkins may
come to an agreement in the matter of
recommendation to the President. The
subject will rest as it now stands until
Senator Bard returns to San Francisco.
Yesterday John T. Dare. United State=
Appraiser, . made formal application to be
appointed Collector. - â¢'
Senator Bard received many callers
yesterday and listened to all suggestions
concerning the fitness of the several can
didates. There is an impression that a
well-known citizen who Is not an appli
cant for the office will be indorsed by both
Senators.
The Republican Club of the Forty-first
Assembly District, Horace Davis presi

Its old-time Republican majority for
President and. member of Congress.
Oscar Sutro, the nominee of the,Citi
zens' Republican party, will receive a
very large vote and his election over. Mar
tin Kelly's nominee is predicted. Kelly
has not yet taken the platform in the dis
trict In advocacy of Dibble's election to
the Assembly, but stands ready to back
his candidate with his oratory. Kelly's
determination to grasp the party machin
i ery In the district and place the Forty
first In line with the Twenty-eighth as a
boss-controlled district has excited the
alarm of good citizens, irrespective of
party. On election day. th^fe will be a
vigorous protest at the polls against Boss

range for a big mass-meeting. Colonel
McCormick stated that It was the duty
of every veteran not only to vote, but to
work until the polls closed for the gal
lant comrade, William McKlnley and
Governor Roosevelt and also the tried

Novel Features of New Club.
Measuring Republicanism by inches is
a novel method of procuring members for
a club, but such will be the method
pursued by the Republican Marching
Club at its grand rally to-morrow even
ing, October 13, at 1442 Market street.
The object Is to form a club, such as for
merly existed In Pittsburg. composed of
members whose height shall not be less
than six feet. It is proposed to have a
uniform, as did the Pittsburg club, and
that was composed of blue coat, red
trousers and an Immense red shako, with
a" tall plume, which with the great
height of tho members made the c'ub
famous. Republicans desirous of becom
ing members of the club should address
J. A. Wells, 1442 Market street. The
meeting to-morrow night will be ad
dressed by prominent speakers, who will
discuss the issues of the campaign.

NO AGREEMENT

CHAFING UNDER
NEGLECT, REED
SCORES PHELAN
He Declares the Mayor Is
Delaying Water-Rate
Investigation.
Says That the Meeting Last Night
Failed of a Quorum Because
. His Honor so
â¢Willed It.
â¢ â
The Board of SuperviGors was to have
met last xriE'ht tor the purpose of begin
ning an Investigation into the value of
the plant of the Spring Valley Water
Company, but only two membersâ Reed
anfl Connor â were present. As there was
no Quorum the investigation was of ne
ccsslty postponed, but not before Reed
had severely scored Mayor Phelan, whom
he accused of being the instigator of a
plot to delay the investigation. Inci
dentally Reed paid his respects to several
of his colleagues, whom he said were only
too willing to do the bidding of their mas
ter.
When It was known that no other Su
j*rvisors would be present at last night's
meeting. Chief Clerk Behan, in the ab
sence of the Mayor, called it to order and
stated that hÂ© â¢would entertain a motion
to adjourn. Reed then entered a. formal
protest against the action of the Super
visors and the Mayor. In tones of Â»up
pressed excitement Reed said:
â¢"The Board of Supervisors adjourned
cn Monday last to meet this evening with
a view to fixing ultimately the rates to
be charged by the Spring Valley Water
Company for â¢water during the next fis
cal year. I have information that after
adjournment the Mayor and a favored
few of the board agreed that the Investi
gation should not be commenced until
next December. It was then understood
that only one or two members 6hould put
In an appearance this evening so that
the investigation could not be com
menced. In doing this and in ordering
notices to be served oa the Supervisors
and others interested not to attend I
claim that the Mayor acted without the
least authority. He had no right to do
It as he is not a member of the board,
but only its presiding offlcer.
"The Investigation of water rates was
placed In the hands of the Committee on
Public Utilities, of which I have the honor
to be chairman, by resolution passed last
July. It was understood that the com
mittee ehould perform all the preliminary
work which would be Impossible In the
full board. We all know how perfunctory
the last Investigation was and how little
information was gleaned. It was Intended
to go into this subject thoroughly, and
for that purpose the committee was en
larged by several members. While the
Mayor was in Europe the committee did
very well, but when his Honor came back
the members became lukewarm. Their
tttitude changed for some reason or other
and I received little or no assistance from
them. It is easy to see that little satis
faction v.-ill be gained from the coming
investigation." â¢
An adjournment was taken when Reed
finished, and Connor, who had remained
mute under the castigation, stated that
Engineer Schussler would return from
Europe in December and the investigation
would most likely be commenced then.
The tale of a woman's misplaced trust
and confidence was told In Judge Conlan's
court yesterday by Mrs. S. M. Cleghorn,
412 McAllister street. Mrs. Cleghorn Is a
widow, and about three months ago be
came acquainted In Red Bluff with Gus
Van DÂ«tten. who represented to her that
ha was " the proprietor of a saloon and
restaurant there, when, in fact, he was
only a bartender in the saloon. ; After a
brief courtship he proposed marriage to
her and was accepted. Six weeks ago
they came to this. city. The widow had
sold out her lodging-house with the inten
tion of being married here.
Mrs. Cleghorn went to 412 McAllister
street and Van Detten took a room down
town. September 9 he borrowed from her
$200, a revolver valued at $12 and a gold
breastpin. Her gold watch, valued at $100,
was out of order, and he suggested she
should give it to him. and he would see
that It was repaired. He got It also.
Mrs. Cleghorn did not see Van Detten
again till last week, when she happened
to meet him on the street. He told ber
that her watch had been stolen from him
by William Isaacs, a waiter In the Obe
ron, while he was drunk, and he Induced
her to swear to a warrant for Isaacs' ar
rest on a charge of grand larceny. Isaacs
was arrested and when the case was call
ed in Judge Conlan's court Monday Van
Detten failed to appear, and a bench war
rant was issued for his arrest. Isaacs'
wife was in court, but refused to testify.
The previous night she had be'en seen in
company with Van Detten, the court was
informed. It was suggested that a plot
had been formed to send Isaacs to jail. â¢
The case was continued till 'Wednesday,
and as Van Detten could not be found
the Judge dismissed It, as he felt satis
fled that Isaacs had nothing to do with
the disappearance of Mrs. Cleghorn's
watch.
Wednesday night Van Detten was ar
rested on O'Farrell street by Policeman
Colen while talking to Mrs. Isaacs' moth
ed. He had shaved off his long beard, but
the officer recognized him. Van Detten
appeared before the Judge yesterday
morning, and when asked why he had not
appeared In court, Monday and why he
had shaved off his beard he replied that
It was to save Mrs. Cleghorn from noto
riety. The Judge ordered him into cus
tody for contempt of court.
Mrs. Clcghorn was in court and related
to the Judge how Van r>etten had de
ceived her and had got the money and
other articles from her. Mrs. Isaacs had
returned hex the \ watch, saying that her
husband had given it to her for fear the
police might suspect and search him. The
Judge was more than ever convinced that
there was a plot to send Isaacs to Jail,
and suggested to Mrs. Cleghorn that she
should swear to a complaint charging Van
Detten with felony embezzlement, which
was done, and he was booked on the
charge.
