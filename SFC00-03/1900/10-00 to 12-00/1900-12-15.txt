CITY STORM SWEPT !
Lightning, rain and wind took possession of San Francisco
yesterday morning and left crushed structures, dismantled build
ings and the wreck of walks, fences, pole's, signs and windows in
their train. For the first time in the history of the city lightning
struck and did damage. One of the giant gasometers of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company at Bay and Buchanan streets
was struck by lightning and destroyed. The storm continued for less
than half an hour, but\for one minute the wind attained the unpar
alleled velocity of sixty miles an hour. Its average was forty
eight miles an hour.

passed yesterday morning a
half-hour of terror which
they will never forget. The
elements were at war upon
the city. For one minute the
wind raced at the rate of
â¢Ixty miles an hour. The rain poured in
torrents from bla^k fckles, the thunder
boomed with the deafening sound of can
non and lightning flashed Its way â¢ from '
out of the clouds into the city. It was
the shortest, severest, deadliest etorm in
the history of San Francisco. For the

From the Menace of Instant
Death In the Ruins,
BUILDING CRUSHED
UNDER RAGING WIND
As if by a miracle, not a person in or
around the works was injured. Tons of
iron and steel collapsed into twisted, giant
masses, but no man was struck.'
In a few minutes, however, they recov
ered their senses, the flames were extin
guished and all danger of further disaster
was over. Presdent Crockett, who took
charge of affairs, estimates the damage at
a sum between $5000 and $7000. No incon
venience was caused to gas consumers,
and the gasometer will be rebuilt at once.
If in its mad freak the lightning had
struck* the larger gasometer, containing
2,000,000 cubic ieet of gas, It is Impossible
to estimate what the damage would have
been. Eye-witneFses of the explosion yes
terday say that the flame which ascended
into the sky seemed to be four blocks
square.
In an instant a small blue flame quiv
ered its way around the circumference of
the top of the holder. There was a deaf
ening crash and a great volume of flame
shot 200 feet into the sky. The enormous
eteel structure wavered, the great sup
porting columns swayed outward and with
irresistible crash the whole fabric col
lapsed. The flames had spread to two
towering tanks near by, and the mam
moth adjoining gasometer seemed in im
minent danger. But the workmen were
paralyzed wth fear.
The gas works are on the bay shore and
received the full force of the raging wind.
Not fifty feet away from the destroyed
gasometer, which had a capacity of 240,000
cubic feet of gas. Is another,-* which tow
ers to a height of 104 feet and has a capac
ity of 2.000,000 cubic feet of gas. The storm
had been raging for twenty minutes when
out of the southwestern sky there came
a blinding flash of lightning. It struck
the top of the holder, burst the iron
wheels and supports and wrenched open
the top of the gasometer.
Francisco Gas and Electric Company, at
Bay and Buchanan streets, was destroyed.
When the storm was at^its very height,
at 10:20 o'clock, the smallest of the gaso
meters," a giant structure, of steel and
iron seventy-nine feet in diameter and
forty feet high, was struck. by lightning
and destroyed. This is the only instance
in the history of the city "where damage

store were - lifted ' out' of - their frames

ing to Consul Dudley's inquiries concern
ing the regulations governing miners
within the strip of disputed territory in
Alaska and also regarding the controversy
over the fisheries on the coast of British
Columbia,
Concerning the fishing question the
State Department informs the Consul that
it cannot undertake to advise persons aa
to what course they should pursue in the
matter of fishing in the waters of Dlxon
entrance and Hecate Strait, but it would
endeavor to protect all legitimate Inter

Proceeding to the boundary disputes
Secretary ! Hay | refers the Consul to the
modus Vivendi, which he says established
merely a provisional line between the re
spective jurisdictions of the United States
and Cann4a. without prejudice to the
fullest assertion of American rights and
the determination of the true treaty boun
dary when the time shall come for ita
permanent settlement. When that time
comes every legitimate' right under the
treaty of cession of Alaska will be as
serted. In conclusion Secretary Hay
says:
"The rights of the United States in the

She had barely reached her rtock when
the hurricane broke. There were five
bridal parties on the Walla Walla and
all were glad when they were once more

Captain Wallace, superintendent of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, was at
Meiggs wharf looking for one of his fleet.
He left his buggy to make an inquiry at

damage on the water front as
was expected. A tour of the
beach from Melggs wharf to the

accidents were minor and that
while- several ships had close calls nearly
all escaped without injury.
Two vessels were making port and
nearly collided on the bar. Two fisher-^
men's boats were capsized, but the flshe'r
men were rescued. A Whitehall boat went,
down, but the occupant was picked up by
a tugboat. One of the ferryboats nearly

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec 14.â Political
considerations will enter largely into the
reapportionment of Representatives in
Congress and Presidential electors under
the new census. Two district plans are
proposed, and it is possible that the re
sult of the next Presidential election may
depend upon which one is adopted.
Representative Hopkins of Illinois,
chairman of the Census Committee of tho
Hovse, has prepared a bill which pre
serves the total membership of the House
and the present number of Presidential
electors. On the basis of the electoral vote
in the November election the political
gains and losses under the Hopkins bill
exactly counterbalance each other,- and
neither party would have any advantage.
Representative Burleigh of Maine has
introduced a bill drawn so as to prevent
â¢the reduction" of representation- In any
State, but which increases the member
ship of the House and the number, of elec
tors. It would also give the Republicans
an advantage in the House, though as the
political complexion of the . Congressional
districts depends upon the action of State
Legislatures in redistricting States, this
cannot be estimated exactly. Under the
Hopkins bill, which makes a population of
~06.Â£S6 the basis oÂ£ representation,- the
following States will gain: Illinois, Louis
iana, Minnesc ta , New Jersey, New York
and â¢ West' Virginia one each , and '.Texas
two. States that will lose 'one Â£ach are:
Indiana, Kansas . Kentucky, Maine, Ne
braska, Ohio, Virginia and South Caro
lina.
Under the Burleigh bill, which makes a
population of 192,676 the -basis of repre
sentation, no State will lose and these will
gain: Illinois,- New York,' and 5 Texas,
three each; Minnesota, New Jersey;. and
Pennsylvania, two each, and Arkansas,
California, Colorado. Connecticut, Florida
Iowa, Louisiana. Massachusetts. Missis
sippi, Missouri, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Washington, West 'Virginia and
Wisconsin, one each. /. ; ' - - -.
The Census Committee will take up the
consideration of these bills to-morrow and
present prospects point to the reporting
of the Burleigh . bill by a majority of the
members. '

The greatest damage was done at the
Judpon Iron Works, where the roof of the
machine shop was torn off and a. long
section of fence leveled- The machine
chop roof is ever 1M feet long, and it was
lifted <->ff as one lifts a lid, and thrown
with violence against the other buildings
of the works, frightening the men at work
tnd causing them to seek the street for
safety. Debris was flying in all direc
tions, making it hazardous to stand in any
exposed x>lace.
At the stock yards the wind tore sheds
to pieces with great prodigality. Only
one or two cf the shelters for cattle and
kheep were left standing when the storm
abated. The Grayson-Owen Co.'s sheds
were blown across the railroad tracks,
causing a temporary stoppage of the lo
cal trains, and John Stewart's sheep cor
rals were rendered useless. Slater & Co.,
butchers, suffered the loss of their wind
mill and tank, both coming down after
the first gust.
Opposite the ParaffinÂ© Paint Works.
near Golden*\ Gate, a two-story house
That has just been completed, was moved
along three feet off its brick foundation,
causing it to have a decided list to star
board. It was unoccupied.
The greatest injury in Oakland was at
the end of Long Wharf. There the storm
caused a train wreck, threw four cars
into the bay and nearly turned a loaded
freight train over into the water.
A freight train of thirty-two cars, loaded
with coal, was being hauled from the end
of Long Wharf to the railroad yards. The
train had no trouble until it reached a
point where the Long Wharf Joins the
mole. Four empty freight cars were
standing upen a siding, and just as the.
coal train reached the siding the force
of the wind began to drive the empty cars
toward the main line. The cars gathered
considerable force, and struck the coal
train Just back of the engine, running
squarely into the first car. of the train.
The force of the shock was so great that
the ceaJ train was almost toppled- over,
and the four empty cars were thrown Into
the bay by the recoil. Traffic over Long
Wharf was blocked by this wreck and the
efforts to get the sunken cars out of the
bay.
Damage to the wires on the pier was
very severe. The entire block system and
train dispatching system werewrerjted for
a considerable time during the d:#\ The
large poles that carry the cables along
the mole for the Sunset Telephone Com
pany, the Western Union and Postal Tel- !
cgraph companies and the wires of the
raiiroaa woie all blown down. This de
layed trains, v.hlch had to be brought
down the pier under hand flagging.
The telephone and telegraphic cables
went with the railroad wires, and it wafc
noon before a wire was secured to San*
Francisco, and that was around the bay o
by way of San Jose. No telephonic com
munication could be had all day with San
it rancisco direct.
The freight transfer boat Thoroughfare
broke loose from her moorings during the
storm and drifted upon the mudflats. A
force of men had to-be sent out to keep
the vessel from drifting upon the stone
racing of the pier and being wrecked.
Tho danger trom high signboards was
clearly illustrated from the way in which
these. fences were blown down. Seventh
street from West Oakland to East Oak
land was littered with the debris of
wrecked signboards. Fences were blown
down in all directions, and a large force
of men had to be kept at work on the
streets clearing away the wreckage.
It took only a few moments to do sev
eral thousand dollars' worth of damage
to houses in Lorin and South Berkeley.
The storm center seemed to be in these
districts. St. Matthew's Episcopal Mis
sion, at the corner of Russell and Grove
streets, in South Berkeley, was complete
ly demolished. One entire half of the roof
was lifted by the wind, carried across a
flfty-foot lot and dropped into Russell
street. Both sides and the front of tho
building were blown flat. One end of the
remaining half of the roof dropped to the
floor, but the other end was held in place
by the rear wall. This rear wall was the
only part of the church left standing, and
it was badly twisted. The buildftig can
not bj> repaired. v,*.-,
The church furniture was not badly
damaged. The organ escaped being
wrecked, but was considerably injured by
the rain. â¢â '
St. Matthew's Episcopal Mission was re
cently moved to its present location from
Alcatraz avenue. The building was held
in trust by the California diocese. Its
affairs were partially governed by the

amounted to $500. " _L-
A five-room cottage at 1533 Julia street',
near Calais, was- wrenched two feet out
of plumb. The storm struck the front of
the house, twisting It around and causing
it to lean at a dangerous angle with the
walls of the basement. The place is own
ed by O. M. Jones. At the time the storm
struck the house there were ten men -at
work in the basement making leather
goods. As the house twisted and snapped
above them and the basement- walls
swayed the men made a wild scramble
for the door. The twisting of the wall
made it impossible to open the door and
the men were threatened with what for
a moment seemed certain death. Fortu
nately the terrific blast of wind which
had done the damage passed in an in
stant. The house was injured to the ex
tent of several hundred dollars. The
chimney is cracked from top to bottom.
\V. M. Davis' house on Delaware street,
"West IVrkeley, was lifted from its foun

Considerable damage was done to tho

At 2128 Telegraph avenue the windmill
was blown from the tank frame and went
crashing into the roof of the house. Tho
wreck of the wheel w'as complete and the

place was owned by Mrs. M. J. Pidgeon,
who was home at the time.
The tank, windmill and frame belong

with reference to the trade relations be

will be remembered that a fear was ex
pressed some months ago that certain
trade restrictions proposed in Germany
might seriously interrupt the commercial
relations between that country and the
United States, and especially decrease our
exports to that country in agricultural
products. Figures just issued by the

our exports to Germany In the ten moiuh.i

into the great Japanese Deep, that for
many years held the record for ocean
depths. This record was finally displaced
by the greater depth discovered in the
South Pacific Ocean by the English sur
veying ship Penguin, and that must now
give way to the Nero Deep.
The object of the surveying expedition
was most successfully and expeditiously
accomplished. A satisfactory route for
an all-AmeriÂ«a.n cable for the purpose of
connecting the Pacific Coast with the out
lying colonial possessions of the United
States in the Pacific, and with China and"
Japan, has been discovered, thoroughly
explored, surveyed and mapped. In ad
dition a great amount of data on ocean
currents, prevailing winds and tidal in
fluences in parts of the ocean little known,
that will prove of great value to naviga
tion In the future, were collected. The
specimens of the bottom collected are now
in the hands of the Smithsonian Institu
tion for examination.
It is believed that the cable could be
completed and ready for operation in
about three years..
A complete and thorough Burvey has
been made of the Midway Islands and
landing places have been selected for a
cable at the variou3 stations in the Pa
cific. The Navy Department is ready to
lay a cable entirely across the Pacific or
any portion of It, at any time.
The cost of making, laying and main
taining a trans-Pacific cable was esti
mated by Admiral (Bradford and sub
mitted to the Senate Committee on Naval
Affairs and is $10,000,000. with yearly ex
penses of maintenance thereafter of $475,
oOO. The allowance for new cable la based
on the idea of supplying enough new cable
each' year tÂ» replace the entire cable in
forty years. This calls approximately for
200 miles of new cable per annum.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â In
view of impending favorable
legislation on a trans-Pacific
cable between San -Francisco
and Manila the results of the
survey by the United States steamship
Nero between Honolulu and the Philip
pine Islands form one of the most inter
esting features of the annual report of
Admiral Bradford, chief of the bureau of
equipment. In general terms these re
sults may be described as follows:
An almost level plain of soft mud, at a
general depth of about 2700 fathoms, ex
tends from Honolulu to the Midway Isl
ands on a route to the northward of the
line of reefs running about west-north
west from the Hawaiian Islands to a
point beyond Ocean Island. This plain af
fords an ideal route for a submarine tele
graph cable.
In general the bed of the ocean between
Midway Islands and Guam is another
great level plain from 3100 to 3200 fathoms
deep. It is, however, somewhat broken
by submarine reefs and mountain ranges.
The first thousand miles from Midway,
with the exception ol one Isolated moun
tain peak not far from Ocean Island, ris
ing to within eighty-two fathoms of the
surface, is entirely level. The remainder
of the distance, however, while In general
fairly level, is Interspersed with reefs and
mountain ranges that required much time
to explore and avoid. Eventually a short
distance to the eastward of the great sub
marine mountain rajige running nearly
nortfi and south that breaks through the
surface of the sea and forms the Islands
of the Ladrone Group and near the par
allel of Guam, this plain descends into the
valley of the Nero Deep, with a depth of
The route between Guam and Yokohama
lies to the westward of the Ladrone Isl
ands and to the eastward of the Bonln
Islands. An almost level plain with a
depth of about 2100 fathoms was found for
a distance of 500 knots from Guam. . At
that point a submarine mountain range
was discovered which apparently connects
the range extending from the coast of
Japan to the Bonin Islands with that of
the Ladrone Islands. While crossing this
range a submarine peak rising to within
483 fathoms of the surface was found and
developed, which, if it could be seen,
would closely resemble the famous vol
cano Fujiyama, near Yokohama, Japan.
To the north of this range the bed of the
ocean slopes gradually to the eastward
Between Guam and the Philippines the
bed of the ocean is less regular than to
the eastward. For the first 600 knots of
the route selected the depths vary from
1400 to 2700 fathoms; there are, however,
no sharply defined ranges of hills or val
leys, the character of the bottom being
of an undulating nature. After COO knots
had been traversed a low mountain range
was discovered sloping to the westward,
eventually forming .a deeper plain that
extends unbroken to the Philippine Isl
ands. The last-mentioned plain varies in
depth from 3000 to 3500 fathoms and Is
also of a gently undulating nature. There
is nothing, however, to obstruct .the suc
cessful laying and working of cables, and
the bottom of soft mud and ooze indicates
that a long life to cables may be ex
pected.
only sixty-six feet. less than six statute
miles. A practicable cable route to Guam
was eventually found to the northward
of the deep. The southern limits of the
deep are unknown, and it may present
still greater depths than those found by
the Nero.

Vice President Duncan offered as a sub
stitute an amendment pledging the good
services of the federation for further me
diation between the organizations con
cerned and requiring the incoming execu
tive council to facilitate a settlement of
the difficulty within the ensuing year:
also criticizing the Typographical Union
for non-submission of the dispute to arbi
tration.
Delegate Rosenberg, of San Francisco,
declared that the opposition to trade au
tonomy was in line with the general im
perialistic idea now dominant the world
over.
The debate on concurrence in this report
was long and sometimes violent. The
compromise report of the committee was
adopted by a vote of 2384 to 1613.
With reference to the dispute between
the International Association of Machin
ists and the International Typographical
Union, as to trade autonomy, the resolu
tions committee recommend that the Fed
eration of Labor refuse to interfere. This
precipitated a polemic battle between
President O'Connell, of the machinists,
who opposed the 'committee's, recommen
dation and President Lynch, of the Typo
graphical Union, who supported It.
O'Connell protested against any propo
sition to force the machinists tojcln the
International Typographical Union, main
taining that a man who takes care of a
linotype machine mechanically Is properly
a member of the machinists craft. Lynch
argued in favor of only one union of
workers in printing offices in order that
the rights of the employes might be more
advantageously maintained.
On this resolution the committee made
a compromise report which was virtually
a pronouncement against trade autonomy
and in favor of organization on an in
dustrial basis. In the particular instance
brought up by the resolution the com
mittee favored allowing the United Brew
ers' Union and the large organizations to
regulate their own affairs and to affiliate
with them the engineers and the other
auxiliary crafts. â¢
LOUISVILLE. Dec. 14.â The convention

national Union of Steam Engineers, ex
pressing the sense of the federation that
"national and international unions of any
trade affiliated therewith shall have ex
clusive jurisdiction over that trade with

of United Brewery Workers," directing
the United Brewery Workers to instruct
all engineer*, firemen, machinists, team
drivers, coopers, painters and other me
chanics employed In breweries where
trades are affiliated with the federation
to join immediately the legitimate union
of their trade and to withdraw from mem
bership in the United Brewery Workers:
also directing the Brewery Workers
Union to refrain In the future from in
itiating mechanics whose trades are other*
wise organized and affiliated; failure to
comply on the part of the United Brewery
Workers to be sufficient ground for the
revocation of their charter.

American Surveyors to Locate the
Line Through the Mount
Baker District.
SEATTLE. Dec. 14.â United States Sen
ator Foster writes that the State Depart
ment has taken up the dispute as to the
exact location of the international bound
ary line where it passes through the
Mount Baker mining district and has re
quested from the Canadian Government
a copy of the report of Its engineering
party which was engaged this year in re
surveying the line. The nature of the re
port has occasioned many surmises and
has only added to the confusion already
existing regarding the real location of the
line.
When the Canadian Government com
plies with the request. Senator Foster
says, the United States Government will I
have a survey made by American en- j
glneers and reports of these two survey
ing parties will be made the basis of ne
gotiations for a final determination of the
dispute. It Is admitted that the engineers
who made the survey in 1S54 did not run
the line clear through, but at points eas
iest of access, determined from astronom
ical observations the location of the forty
ninth parallel and Bet their monuments
from these. Thus It happens that in this
mountainous district there really never
has been a survey made. Now that prec
ious metals have been discovered in this
territory a definite location of the line
is necessary.
PARIS. Dec. 14.-The French Govern
ment will not offer objection to any action

"Should the United States denounce the
treaty there is no means known to inter
national law of upholding it. The only
known method of inducing a state to ac
cept an obligation of which it is tired is
the method of compulsion. That method
is out cf the question and will hardly be
proposed, but it will be open to Great
Britain alone or in conjunction with other
maritime states to consider whether an
other canal, not under the control of the
United States, may be worth the making.
In this matter British Interests are iden
tical with the interests of all the maritime
powers save the L'niied States."
FRANCE NOT TO INTERFERE.
The Morning Post, after contending that
England in ntgrotiatir.g the Ciayton-Bul
wer treaty was acting virtually as the
representative of all the maritime powers
of the world, says:
The Standard observes: "It is more of
a rebuff for President McKinley's execu
tive than for Great Britain. England can
not possibly accept the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty thus amended, and it would be in
sulting to the people and Government of
the I nited States to assume that they
would either denounce the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty without offering an equitable
equivalent or coruemplate the gross il
legality of disregarding it. There will bc
time enough to consider the abrogation
of the treaty when Washington formally
tenders a suggestion, which would cer
tainly be approached by Great Britain
with every desire to assist the United
States to carry out a project highly ben
eficial to American commerce, but it can
not be supposed that we would abandon
our treaty rights without solid considera
tion in return."
The Daily Graphic remarks: "We have
no doubt as to the iceult. Anglo-American
statesmanship will find an amicable solu
tion of the difficulty created by Ameri
can jingoes. We fall tot see. however,
how the Clayton-Bulwer treaty can be got
rid of without the Mosquito territory re
verting to Great ilruain."
and It is now stamped by self-Interest.
The Americans intend to fortify the canal
in spite of the treaty agreement to the
contrary. We cannot possibly stand by
and allow the Clayton-Bulwer treaty to
be thus imperiously set aside. The good
relations between the two countries mu6t
of necessity be gravely menaced. This
Is the outcome of Mr. McKinley's re
election. Worse could have hardly hap
pened if Mr. Bryan had been returned."
WASHINGTON'. E>Â«c. 14.âTbÂ» Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations to-day
held a special meeting and decided to rec
ommend further amendments of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty. The committee adopt
ed an amendment suggested by Senator
Foraker. which declares that the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty supersedes the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty, and also strikes out
of the Hay-Pauncefote agreement article
III. which permits the submission of the
Hay-PauncefotÂ« treatv to other powers
and invites their acceptance of It.
The action of the Committee on Foreign
Relation* was taken after a prolonged
conference of Senators especially Inter
ested In the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. The
-Republican members announced that they
were prepared to amend the treaty on the
lines of the Foraker suggestion; that they
considered this amendment comprehen
sive enough to meet all demands, and
that they would do no more. The Foraker
unendmjrt was accoraingriy agreed to.
i ne Importance of the treaty relating to
pending legislation was considered aud a
oecision was arrived at to press the
iisreement to a vote if possible. It was
aiso decided that it would be difficult
to get it through without still further
amendment, and the Foraker amendment
Wius suggested as meeting all objectioas.
I i:e President and Secretary Hay were
fclso consulted with reference to the ad
visability of further amending the treaty,
by Senator* Lodge and Foraker. who
culled upon them before coming to '.he
cajiitol to-day.
Culess amended beyond any degree pro

comparing in some degree with the Olney
1'i.uncrfote arbitration treaty.
Any expectation that the action of the
S^nnte yesterday upon the Devis amend
ment to the treaty would result in tliÂ«
immediate retirement of Secretary Hay
from the Cabinet is negatived by the fact
that the Secretary has not rrsipned and
Â£<ord!ng to his own statement will not
leave tlie Cabinet at present.
When the Senate vent Into executive
t esFion Senator Lodge reported the
amendmeuts agreed upon in committee.
There were two. The first of these inserts
the word? "which is Hereby superseded"
after tilt words "Clayton-Hulwer treaty"
in the first paragraph of article II of the
treaty, making that paragraph read aa
follows: "The high contracting parties,
desiring to preserve and maintain the gen
eral principle of neutralization established
hi article VIII of the Clayton-Bulwer
convention, whicli is hereby superseded,
adopt as the basis of such neutralization
the following rules, substantially as em
bodied in the convention between Great
Britain ard certain other powers signed
at Constantinople Oct.il.er 29. 138S. for tha
free riavieraxion of the Suez maritime
canal."
The Feccrd of these amendments strikes
out article III of the treaty, reading: "The
high contracting parties will immediately
t:pon the exohar.Re of the ratifications of
this convention bring it to the notice of
the other powers ana invite them to ad
here to it."
It was stated that the committee had
been unanimous in iht- action with the
exception of Senator Minn 1 , who oppose3
any action except the absolute and un
conditional abrogation of the Clayton-
Buircr treaty. That result Is aocom

ONE WOMAN
With two face* ; one face bright with
health, the other face pinched ssd drawn
by illness. Many a woman can take the
portrait of herself made but a few years
ego, and holding it by her face in the
mirror realize a similar change.
Behind this change in form and fea-
ture is always disease, and generally dis-
ease which affects the womanly organ-
ism. The backache and bearing-down
pains put a heavy strain on the nervous
system. There is loss of sleep, lack of
appetite, and, as a natural result, loss of
strength and flesh.
Doctor Pierce's Favorite Prescription
cures diseases of the womanly organs.
It establishes regularity, dries enfeebling
drains, heals inflammation and ulcera-
tion and cures female weakness.
Â¦ Word* cannot tell irbal I attffered for thirteen
years with womb trouble and draj^injr-down
p^ins through my hips and back," writes Mrs.
John Dickson. of Grrnfcll. Assiniboia Dist., N.W.
7>r. "I can't describe the misery it wat to be
os my feet long at a time. Z could not eat nor
s!?cp. often I wished to die. Then I eaw Dr.
Pirrw's medicines advertised and thoerht I
would try them. Had not taken one bottle till
I wÂ«s feeling well. After I bad taken five
Ixittles of 4 FÂ«rorite Prescription' and one of
'Golden Medical Diaeovery' I wu like a new
woman. Could eat and tleep and do all my
cwn work. I would entreat of any lady suffcr-
>?ig from female weakness to rlre Dr. Jterce's
Favorite Prescription a tail trial, for I know the
benefit Â»he will receive."

Century Club announces that the light
ning fighter win be one of the first ap
proached. The field of legitimate fighters
of big reputations is small and more than
ordinary diligence will be required to
bring about well-arranged matches.
On Thursday next the Columbia Ath
letic Club will give an exhibition, the
principal event of which will be a 20
round fight between Otto Cribb the Aus
tralian welterweight, lately Imported, and
Frank McConnell. Cribb is training at
the Six-Mile House with Soldier Green,
and McConnell is at the Seal Rock House
with "Spider" Kelly. The "Spider" is
matched with Doc Flynn. Cribb has mode
quite a reputation In his own country as
a whirlwind affair with not too much re
spect for the rules and laws of the game.
His defeated opponents have many harsh
things to say about fouling propensities
and rough tactiea. This will be his Initial
appearance In San Francisco.
There is a club, already Incorporated,
the Twentieth Century Club, that claims
for itself tho title of a reformer in a
much-polluted ring community. Matches.
If Its members remember their original
protestations, will be arranged between
only men of national reputation. Mc-
Govern Is needed to resuscitate legitimate
fighting on this coast, and the Twentieth

bouts, with blood anl thunder, accom
paniments, to the ultimate sacrifice of
skill and science, seem to be thftir mis
sion. There was a time when these clubs
served a purpose in tlie line of develop
ment. Then there was a single contest
each month between young aspirants who
were fairly well trained. Now these ex
hibitions come so thick and fast that,
no matter how cyclonic in character they
are the public appetite is glutted. Tha
surfeit will soon destroy It.
WHAT will the New Year bring
for the pugilistic game?
Something good â different
from what we are having â
or an intensified form of th-3
present rubbish? These are questions that
are being asked on every hand and the
answers will not be known until the New
Year is fairly under way.
Pugilismâ high-class fighting and box
ingâhas never been at bo low an ebb in
San Francisco as at the present time.
Ehiring the past year not a single fight
of consequence had San Francisco for it*

charitable, has been brought to the front
and phenix-Uke attempts have been
made with Incinerated materlpi. That is

On the San Pablo raarsnes last Sunday the shooting was poor. No wind and
plenty of fee that was thick and low were the responsible agents. Spoonbills
predominated in the bags, all of which -srere small. Now and then an Isolated
canvasback was seen among them. On the Suisun marshes sprig was first. At

about fifty members of the Golden Gate

several happy hours last Saturday ever

when the drivers of fast horses sat down
to a repast that lasted till the small hours
grew Into lone ones.
Speeches and the popping wine were the
Joy provokers. After a heartry. Jolly time
the party broke up and the ribbon-hand
lers took to their teams and drove city

meet will be at Wellesley Park, Redwood
City, at 9:30 in the morning.
The run last Saturday was one rf the
pleasantest that has been enjoyed this
seaccn. Ihe meet was at Uncle Tom's
Cabin at 2 p. m.. and after a delay of a
quarter of an hour to allow those who
had been lunching with Prince Poniatow
ski at Tanforan to put in an appearance,
the riders dropped into the field opposite
Uncle Tom's Cabin and kept to the left
of the road for about a mile. Then the
field crossed the road and retraced its
fctcps to Uncle Tom's Cabin, proceeding in
a westerly direction, and Jumping a par
ticularly tall piece of timber on the way.
The firstcheck occurred after about three
miles. The hounds were then laid on at
the top of the hill and led the way over
some beautiful galloping ground, crossing
the Crystal Springs road, where the sec
ond check occurred. The pack was laid
on for the third time above D. O. Mills'
place, and finished a good run in front of
F. J. Carolan's house. L

er the San Francisco Golf Club could re
ceive them on March 5 and 6, 1901. A re
ply has been forwarded offering the hos
pitality of the Presidio Club on those
days. The exact nature, however, of the
tournament to be held has not been de
cided, though the generaUdesire seems to
be for an event open to amateurs and pro
fessionals alike, with money prizes for
the professionals and trophies for the am
ateurs. Such a contest would bring In
the Rawlins brothers, Robert . Johnstone,
James Melville, George _.nlth of San Ra
fael, as well as the strongest of the ama
teurs, who on a course with which they
are thoroughly familiar ought to be able
to push the visitors pretty closely.

and If one sees an opening he is going to
try to get through, heedless of the
thought that a severe accident may re
sult. And for this choosing of the "over
land route" as it is termed on the track,
Buliman has been criticized time after
time. As he brings home many a winner
and is on the "firing line" all the time,
which his critics are not, his argument
carries much force with it.
Of the older brigade, Nash Turner
seems to be going back, due perhaps to
increasing weight. Then, too. Xash, a
very quiet and reserved young man, may
have saved most of the money he has

earned, and keen observers are Inclined
to the belief that this fact often detracts
from a rider's dash and courage. The sea
captain who has acquired a competency,
in many instances no lonper cares to face
the dangers of the sailor^ life, and jock
eys are but human. Johnny Woods pegs
along in the same groove, no worse, no
better than he was a couple of years
back. Coburn uses very good Judgment
as a rule, and In another year ought to
be a first class rider. Alounce made rapid

ficials for striking Coburn, that rider
would have headed the winning list.
Never a Phowy horseman. Buliman plods
steadily along:, and when it comes muddy
going, has no superior in the country.
It cannot be said in his favor that hu
saves all the ground possible during the
progress of a race, but in explanation of
this, Buliman says: "You never know
what those crazy kids are going to do
next, and I'd rather go around than get
mixed up with them." There Is more
truth than fiction about this statement,
too, for it receives full verification in al
most every race decided at Oakland and

4NEW . YORK. Dec. 14.â Although
Dorothy Drew, who sang "I'd
Leave My Happy Home For
You," has not filed that promised
breach of promise" suit against
Champion James J. Jeffries, it is evident
that she is. "getting the goods" on the
heavy-weight Califomlan.
Mies Drew was a mernber of the big
prize-fighter's company during the sum
mer eeason. Near Its close the rumor got
out that she and Jeff were to make a
match. When Jeffries was asked about It
he said the rumor was true, and referred
further questions to Miss Drew. This
young woman said it was true also and
that the wedding would be within a few
weeks.
Now Jeffries denies that he was ever
engaged to the actress, and to a friend
the b'ig fighter said that he would be a
fool to marry that "pug-nosed soubrette,"
as he termed her. It so happens that Dor
othy is known from coast to coast as a
high kicker, and a few seasons ago while
she was doing her turn in a San Fran
cisco theater she neglected to duck her
head In time and kicked herself on the
nose, breaking It. Since then Dorothy has
had a flat nose. And for this reason a
second thought is supposed to have con
vinced Jeffries that he can secure a wife
without a dameged nose..
To prove that Chamtpion Jeffries was ar
dent in his pursuit of her and that he de-
Sired her near him always, Miss Drew will
exhibit In the suit a collection of tele
grams with which the pugilist kept the
wire busy. She also has letters which she
savs are filled with the fiercest protesta
tions of love and which she says will also
be read in court unless - Mr. Jeffries re
tracts his "brutal and contemptible de
nials" of their engagement to be married.
â¢ Among the telegrams held by Miss Drew
is this one, dated at Scranton, Pa., No
vember 1:
"Miss Dorothy Drew, New \ork City-
Have arranged for your arrival at Mauch
Chunk Saturday, afternoon. Come with
out fall. Answer Wilkesbarre to-morrow.
Will anxiously await you Saturday.
(Signed) Jim."
Other messages and various meetings,
â¢with what occurred at them, will be testi
fied to in court, it is said.
But November 29 he burst into tele
graphic prose once more In this dispatch:
"MIbs Dorothy Drew. Savoy Hotel, New
Haven â Will leave on 12:12. train. 1. Will. you
meet me? Jim." Â»v Â¦,. Â¦â¢- .
Then there was' a lull In the telegraphic
storm, which Miss Drew declares was due
to the pugilist taking to the malls as the
proper medium for love communication.
"Miss Dorothy Drew, Haines House.
Springfield, Maes. â Hope you are feeling
well. Will meet you at train at 6. Will
write. Jim."
The week after, while Miss Drew was In
Springfield, Mass., this telegram reached
her: -,. ':.
"Miss Dorothy Drew, Lyceum Theater,
Baltimore â Will be sure and meet you on
2:30 train. Wire me when you leave. Jim."
Miss Drew says she met him as he de
sired, but the following week Jeffries
seemed to have been as anxious as ever to
see the actress, for November 9 he wired
her at Baltimore this message:
"Miss Dorothy Drew, Lyceum Theater,
Baltimoreâ Get ticket for Philadelphia.
Will meet you at train. Jjm."
Next day before Mls3 Drew arrived Jef
fries sent this dispatch:
Two days later he sent this from the
same place:
"Miss Dorothy Drew, Broad Street Sta
tion, Philadelphiaâ Will meet you at 11:45.
(Signed) Jim." . ,

A "SOCCER" GAME
The much-heralded bout between "Dea
con" Jones, the colored scrapper, and Ah
Wing, the champion of Chinatown, fell
through. Wing was taken sick three days
ago and was unfit to go on. Rather .than
disappoint the spectators he entered the
ring and boxed a tame Â¦ round with the
"Deacon" and was allowed to retire .wltii
colors flying. . : . . : s r...hv-;
The entertainment furnished great sport
for the spectators. The contestants were
well matched and in good condition.
George O'Brien earned a decision over
Jack Warner after four rounds 'of heavy
boxing; Jack Krell knocked out Charles
Royal In the third lound of their bout;
Hugh Friel, an auburn-haired youth, and
Jack Archie battled five fast rounds to a
draw; Billy Snailham gained a well
earned decision over Joe Brodshaw after
four rounds of lierce fighting; "Kid"
Krell, a twin brother of the youth who
won the second bout of the evening,
knocked out. Artie Kelly In the third
round. Krell was sent to the carpet twice
In the second, but came back fighting
hard and in the third he madÂ» Kelly dizzy
with heavy swings and len-hand jabs.
He completed his task with a heavy rlght
cross; Mike Curtain secured a decision
over "Sailor Sharkey" at the end of their
.bout. The Sailor was willing and received
enough punishment to leave a lasting im
pression; Billy Kelly knocked out Henry
Silver in two rounds without much ex
ertion.
More fighting- was done outside the ring
at the San ; Francisco Athletic. Club last
night than within the squared circle. Not'
that the, contestants did not battle as on
previous exhibition nights, but the excited
individuals without the ropes, dodged
more' blows, scored more punches and
sidestepped more leads than the fighters

Track Notes.
When the stcrm had calmed down, the
remains of six worn and battered favor
ite? lay strewn about the track at Oak
land yostcrday. For the majority of the
crowd it was "black Friday." and the
books that did not take too much of the
Hathos money offered laid up something:
The track was of course sloppy from the
terrific showers of rain, scrambling form
and tigures about promiscuously.
The Alontajia contingent made a coup
over the win of the San Jose handicap, at.
a. mile, by Bathos. Allotted SO pounds, the
three-year-old had his price hammered
down from 12 to 5, and won by seventeen
splashes. Ilaviland floundered in second,
eight lengths before Owensboro, touted as
a modern Hindoo in the mud. O'Connor
on the favorite. Specific, ran Into Gusto
en the stretch turn, after .which he pulled
up.
Vantirie, from "Walter Jennings' stable,
was Installed favorite for the opening:
sprint. The nlly. with Mounce up, ran her
usually gooc race, but was no match for
Matt Hogan, which elongated gelding
beat the choice out three lengths. The
Singer, a well backed one, came from the
rear, securing show honors.
There was one horse the slushy going
did suit, and that was Imperious. The
Burn* handicap winner has not been dis
playing much form of late, which caused
his odds in the speculating on the second
event to reach 6 to 1. Away tifth, Johnny
i Woods went to the front before half the
route had been traversed, leadine out
Flamero three lenpths. "Wyoming and
Leonard, the choices, both finished beyond
the money.
Frank Weir's brown colt. Flatterer, took
the six furlong dash for two-year-olds, de
cided tinder selling conditions, with 12 to
1 against his name in the ring. Johnny
Daly, who had the leg up. was first away,
and ridden cut the last hundred yards,
downeo Tenny Belle a length. O'Connor
did not foiiow instructions with the favor
ite. Selde. ending up in third place.
Burns and Waterhouse took the mile and
a furlong selling run with Essence, against
which 4 to 1 was laid. Ranch made a
front run of it. and at the wire the weakly
ridden Torrida fell short about three
lengths. Topmast and Castake fought it
out for third and fourth place respec
tl\*ely.
After opening favorite and receding in
the betting to threes, Ordnung, piloted by
J. Miller, also made an all the way affair
of the final mile run. Herculean, the fa
vorite, tried hard to get up in the run
home, but the Schorr horse held tiie big
chestnut sale.

fore a valuable contribution to the discussions of each
campaign, and, moreover, it serves admirably as a
chapter in municipal history.
It would be worth while for some municipality in
California to try the plan and see if it works as well
here as in the city of its invention. Salem is a small
town, but it is to be remembered that sometimes the
tmallest places can' teach wisdom to the largest cities.

|V I OW that the members of the League of Califor
1 V nia Municipalities have been inspired by their
, convention to the undertaking of new efforts
for improvement in municipal government, we recom
mend to their consideration a plan which has been
tested for some years in Salem, Mass., and which, ac
cording to all reports,- has proven efficient in pro
moting good government.
The plan is simple. There has been organized in
Salem a "Municipal Record Association," for the
purpose, as stated in e recent report, "of keeping a
record of the doings of the city government during
the year, in order that such a record may be placed
before the citizens of Salem previous to the municipal
election, that they may form some idea as to the po
sition of their representatives on Â¦ important matters."
It will be seen that such a report, made up by an as
sociation that is at once non-partisan, impartial and
public spirited, serves a very useful purpose in en
lightening the voters concerning the issues before
them at each municipal election. The public mind
dees not possess a good memory. It does not at elec
tion times recall the whole municipal work of the
year, and consequently is incapable of deciding rightly
between officers who have merited re-election and

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
The United States, very naturally, was. not invited
to take part in the Madrid congress. Nevertheless,
our interests in Spanish-America are great and are
increasing with the years. Â¦Consequently .such in
fluence as our Government can exert throughout that
continent will qndoubtedly be thrown on the side of
In such a situation there is ample room for the ex
ercise* of "compulsory "arbitration" if there be any
power that can exercise (t. The plan itself is cer
tainly a good one. In fact, if such a concert of South
American states could be made effective it might 'lead
up to the establishment of the United States of South
America and give to the people of that continent an
opportunityjto develop in trade, and industry far be
yond anything, that now appears possible. '
From such reports as come to us it appears all these
great expectations .were disappointed. The number of
delegates from Central and' South America was much
smaller than was looked for. Hardly anything that
will affect the commerce or the politics of the world
was attained, and the only notable scheme adopted
was one looking toward the establishment of. a sys
tem of "compulsory arbitration" between Latin coun
tries whose disputes are likely to result in war.
If this scheme of the Madrifl congress have any
more vigor than the plans for peace agreed upon by
the nations at The Hague, the time has come to show
it. South America is badly in need of that kind of ar
bitration at this juncture. In the first place, there is
strife on the part of Chile against both Bolivia and
Peru, which threatens to result in immediate war,
and Brazil and Argentina have a boundary dispute
that may bring about a disturbance of the peace at
any time. Furthermore, Venezuela, Colombia and
all the other states are arming as fast as they can and
are seemingly getting ready for a fight at the first op
portunity.
ARBITRATION IN SOUTH AMERICfJ.
DESPITE the predictions of great things to fol
low which preceded the meeting of the Inter
national Congress at Madrid, it appears
hardly anything was accomplished. â¢ The congress, it
will be remembered, was given many names, such as
Spanish-American Congress, Ibero-American Con
gress, Pan-Latin Congress. It was expected to ar
range a reciprocity of trade between the Latin na

WASHINGTON CITY has celebrated. the ceh-.
tennial of the establishment there of the seat
of government of the United - States with
proper dignity and ceremonial. The city is well
adapted to festivals of this or any other kind. The
streets are broad and well paved, the architecture is
stately, there is little business or traffic to be sus
pended or interrupted, and there is at this season of
the year a large population having plenty of leisure
for holidays. With such advantages to start with. Jt
was a foregone conclusion that the centennial cele
bration would be brilliant, and it appears that all ex
pectations were realized. ,
With all its splendor, however, Washington is po
litically and commercially more isolated than any
other capital or large city in the world. So far from
having a dominating influence in the politics of ths
country, such as is possessed by London, Paris, Ber
lin, Vienna and Rome in their respective countries,
Washington has in the politics of the United States
no influence at all. It has not even^a vote. It does
not so much as possess local self-government. It
presents the curious paradox of a capital of a repub
lic of universal suffrage, administered by a bureau
cratic government,. in the selection of whose officers
the people have no vote nor voice.
Senator Depew, after a year of residence at the
capital,,is reported to have stated that the experience
had convinced him Washington is the pleasantest city
hi the world for a rich man to live in. "It has," he is
quoted as saying, "all the things that rich men de
sire without any of the noises or disturbances of| trade."
Such praise appears to be well deserved. The capital
is one of which the nation may be proud, and in point
of beauty and magnificence it ranks with the fore
rnJbst capitals of the world.
A generation ago there was a considerable agita
tion in favor, of removing the national seat of gov
ernment farther west. That movement was largely
due to the disagreeable condition of Washington it
self as well as to its location. The sewers were bad,
the streets were ill paved/ the Potomac flats were un
healthy, and there were no good hotels. Air those de
fects have been remedied. Boss Shepard, whdfle ex
travagance in public improvement was once the sub
ject of universal condemnation, is now remembe-ed
as a public benefactor of the; first class> The money
he expended has proven to be an investment of the
most profitable character. By making the city health
ful and beautiful he made it attractive as a place of
residence, and now a considerable number of wealthy
Americans have their winter homes there.
"Washington is becoming more and 'more the social
as well as the political capital of the country. Great
; educational institutions are establishing themselves
there, and the city may yet become the literary ' ami
I educational center of the ; republic. Certainly the
prospects are good. .There is no longer any talk of
removing the seat of government to (^hicago or Sk
Louis, and Washington begins the new century of her
existence with an assured .prestige which is more
likely to : increase than to diminish with- the growth
of the republic."* : - - ; . .1 "--;,

Our members of Congress will be asked to secure
the reservation of all unsold timber lands in the State,
to increase the efficiency of the forest patrol and to
promote a national policy of scientific forestry on
the timber reserves. This forest policy is of the
greatest importance. The present policy of permit
ting the unchecked growth of underscrub and the ac
cumulation of duff on the forest floor means the final
destruction of the public forests by fift. Theoretical
foresters have put too much weight upon the lasting
preservation of the fortst floor, as the duff and herb
age are called. An undue accumulation not only pre
vents the seeds of conifers from germinating, but it
spreads fire, from lightning or any other cause.
When each season's stock of duff has performed its
office, as a preventive of evaporation and in retard
ing the flow of water to enable it to sink into the soil,
it should be removed, so that it will neither prevent
seeds from reaching the soil nor serve as a tinder to
spread fires in the dry season.
The officers of the association deserve the thanks
of the State for their excellent work, and it is to be
hoped that the Legislature will give friendly consid
eration to their suggestions.
The otticers and executive committee have been
very active, and the result of their work is a member
ship of 5000, the collection of $18,080 80, and the ex
penditure of $1 5,-244 09. The expenditure has been
for the measurement of the run-off of streams, and
the capacity of their watersheds for filling reservoirs
with storm waters to be saved for irrigation. The
investigation equips the State with certain knowledge
of the amount of water that may be impounded from
the watersheds that have been examined, and of the
cost per acre and per acre 'foot of the impounded
water. The seven reservoir sites thus far selected will
hold 644.624 acre feet, and the cost will be $8 03 per
acre foot, or $5,182,333. It is believed that this
amount of water used in irrigation will produce an
increase in population of the territory covered by
the reservoirs of 200,000 people, and an increase in
land values, exclusive of town property, of $20,000,000.
It is the purpose of the association to ask the Legis
lature to invite a Federal expenditure of $30,000 in
this work by pledging a like sum from the State.
* 1 -HE public will be gratified by the, report of the
work of the Waters and Forests Association.
* Its organization was effected about a year ago.
Its purpose is to, collect the scientific data upon which
the policy of preserving the forests, for their relation
to the moisture required by irrigation, is based.

at work in the far West End, and her
success has been considerable. It is well
known that the average book agent finds
it a difficulty to Invade the average resi
dence with her badge of servitude dis
played. A book or anything like a book
has sufficed to prevent entrance through
well-posted servants. , .â¢.Â¦-Â¦:-
This woman in question has changed all
this. She appears at your door neatly
dressed in the latest fashion, .neatly
gloved, with the latest hat and such/ a
general get-up that if you don't know her
you feel sorry for your ignorance. With
cardcase in hand and clad In fashion she
presents her card and is shown in. Not a

of United' States Supreme Judge David J.

In this receptacle, showing three different

manages to "locomote" with this lncum

cret, but those who have watched her
walk away from the house declare that
she is as graceful In stride as If she were
not carrying as least six pounds of litera
ture, hung in a way that ought sadly to
interfere with her gait.
After she has scaled the -walls In this
fashion and has passed some of the little
compliments of the day to the mlstres3
of the house, who doe3 not know her by
her calling- card, and. maybe, wonders
how she could have forgotten such a de

Such, then, is expert testimony concerning the
richness of the region whose industries are threat
ened and injured by the, scandals caused by the ac
tions of the Federal court at Nome. Public interest,
therefore, as well as public justice, demands a prompt
investigation by Congress of the charges that have
been made 'against the Judge and his receiver.
Alaska promises to be richer than the Canadian
Klondike, but if dishonesty prevail among the officers
of the lau/on the American side of the line while sub
stantial honesty is found on the Canadian side, even
the onerous mining laws of the Dominion will not
prevent the Klondike becoming the most progressive
part of the northern gold country, and Dawson, in
stead of an American city, will be its metropolis. The
present session is short and Congress will be busy, but
none the less it should find time to investigate these
charges and punish any one foun,d guilty. American
law must be made a sure protection to honest industry
wherever the.flag flies.
Dr. Cabell Whitehead, who left the office of chief
assayer of the United States Mint in Washington to
go to Nome, and was commissioned to make a re
port on the gold prospects of the region to the Di
rector of the Mint, is quoted by a correspondent of
the New York Sun is having said recently: "I have
had four months and a half in which to examine this
subject to my own satisfaction, and I have come to
the conclusion that the mining region of the Seward
Peninsula, which includes all of Western Alaska north
of Norton Sound, contains the richest placer deposits
of gold of any that have been discovered since the
days of '49 in California. After having made this
positive statement I may qualify it to the extent that
the Klondike region may possibly exceed this region
in output of precious. metals during the next decade,
burl do not believe it will." .
There is nothing so fatal to any community as cor
ruption in the courts or even a widespread suspicion
of such corruption. Courts are the. protectors' of men
in thdr rights of person and property, and where that
protection is not given or is sold for a price, then all
forms of business and enterprise become so hazardous
that progress and development are summarily 'ar
rested.
The region around Nome is rich in gold, and it is
desirable it should be thoroughly exploited and de
veloped. That cannot be done so long as the foun
tain of justice in the community is poisoned. No in
dustry can be successfully carried on where the in
dustrious and rightful owner of a piece of property
is liable to be robbed of his profits by either fraud j
or violence.
REPRESENTATIVE BRICK of 'Indiana has in
troduced, into the House a resolution calling
for the appointment of a committee of five to
investigate the scandals that have gathered around the
Federal court at Nome. .The resolution has been re
ferred to the Committee on Rules, and it is to be
hoped prompt action will be taken upon it.

NEW LADY BOOK AGENT
AND HER TAKING WAYS
It may be something more than a shrewd guess that
the enemies of the enterprise are the real authors of
this appeal to American patriotism and spirit of inde
pendence, and that those among whom the sentiment
is propagated are the dupes of a deep design to defer
the work as long as possible and cripple it when fin
ished, so that its competition with land transportation
may be minimized.
If we go on in the line chosen by the Senate we
must fortify and garrison the canal as fast as we
build it. It becomes then a military and strategic
outpost, instead of a neutral highway for commerce.
It is as if we undertook to build an American fort,
and garrison -it,- in every seaport in the world. As th,e
work, executed under such circumstances, is a covert
declaration of war against the world, the people
should~go into it with their eyes open. Fortification
will duplicate the cost of the work, and equipping
and garrisoning the fortifications will be added to the
expense of administration, so that those who look to
it as a means of economy in transportation will be
disappointed.
by the decision to nationalize the construction of the
canal. If the work were done through an interme
diate corporation, in which our Government appeared
only as a majority stockholder, there would be no dis
cord due to international interest in the matter. The
Suez canal was built, and had been for some time
operated, before Disraeli made his brilliant coup in
the purchase of a majority of its stock for Great
Britain. There ,1s a great difference between the ap
pearance of a nation in such an enterprise as a stock
holder, or a sovereignty. Since the dissolution of the
Maritime Canal Company, which first undertook the
Nicaragua project, the proposition that this""country
shall appear as a sovereignty and not a stockholder
has replaced all others. The decision is practically
made that this Government is to. build and- own and
operate the canal, as a sovereignty. Therefore, we
disregard the views and plans of all other nations, ex
cept Great Britain. In her case we are incumbered
bj- the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. That convention is an
tagonistic to our present views about the canal. To
reconcile it the Hay-Pauncefo'te treaty was made. But
by this amendment its object is defeated. There is
much ground for apprehension that the views of the
Senate may indefinitely delay the beginning of the
work. Mr. Blaine Is quoted to the effect that we
made the Clayton-Bulwer treaty when we were weak
enough to need its guarantee of neutrality, but now
being strong enough to disregard such guarantee we
should abrogate that treaty without consulting the
wishes of the other party to the contract. It is not
to the discredit of the administration that it v has pre
ferred to represent this to be a covenant keeping na
tion, that will abide ">y its international contracts un
til they are changed by mutual consent.
It will be seen that the issue Is materially affected
It will be seen that this amendment permits the
United States to declare the canal open only to ship?
under the American flag, if deemed for the best inter
ests of this country, which would be easy to prove. If
the work were all within Our territory, under our
jurisdictibn, we could do as we please about its con
struction and control. But it lies within two alien
sovereignties, and all maritime nations have an inter
est in a work, executed by a third sovereignty, which
promises such momentous changes in the world's
commerce.
Heretofore, when ihe canal was projected by an
American corporation, there was no intention to make
if other than a neutral waterway, open* for the peace
ful commerce of the world. : '
This amendment not only changes the entire pur
pose and aspect of the treaty of which it is made a
part,. but practically abrogates the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty.
THE Senate proved to be in an amending mood
when it reached the Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
By an affirmative 1 vote of 65 the 'amendment
which changes the whole intent of the "treaty was
adopted. That' amendment reads: "Nothing in this
treaty shall be construed to prevent the United States
from acquiring sufficient security and sovereignty,
to prevent it from building, operating, maintaining,
controlling and defending the said canal, \>r for any
other purpose that the United States may deem for its
best interest.".
THE AMENDED TREATY.
Our Northern friends have a mistaken
notion about what the Southern people
call "negro rule." We are not Â«frald that
the negroes are going to rule over us.
We are not afraid that the inferior race
will dominate the superior race. But when
a number of white politicians organize th<*
negro voters and bring them Into our local
politics and capture some of the offices,

ple do not want pam-fmonium, but peace.

The fisherman's wealth depends on his

But Dickens Is always kindly and ge

who place him side by side with Cervan

truth doubtless . lies between these ex
tremes.
That Dickens wrote from a full knowl
edge of the life he depicts no one denied,
and that he was kindly and sympathetic
almost to an extreme appears everywhere
in his writings, but it Is also true that he
distorted and exaggerated his scenes un
til at times they are positively grotesque
and that he allowed his feelings to carry
him to such lensrths that sometimes ha
came dangerously near to mawkish senti
mentality. All of Dickens' characters are
exaggerated to some degree.. Take for ex

He seems to have been In many respects
a descendant of Ben Jonson, Both ex
celled in comic characterization ; both
were quick to seize upon some single gro

pearance, some trait or trick, and to mag
nify it until all else was lost sight of.
Uriah Heap is always " 'umble": Poor
Joe is always "a moving on": MIcawber
is always "waiting for something to turn
up." Each has his trademark and we
never lose sight of it.
Dickens had little real wit. Such exag
gerations as "Mr. Pickwick proceeded to
put himself into his clothes and his
clothes into his portmanteau" are fun
rather than wit. He undoubtedly pos
sessed pathos, but. as Saintsbury declares,
"he could never be content with & moder
ate dose of it," and pathos overdone be
comes mere sentimentality.
The truth seems to be that Dickens
created a new world and peopled it with
beings which under exceptional circum
stances might be found in actual life. In
his world there are to be found only ex
aggerations and exceptions, but If we en
ter . it leaving behind us all recollection
of tho real world everything will become
natural and consistent. It Is simply ths
pitching of life In another keyâ to enjoy
it one must shut out tho real life about
him, else there will be discord; but when
once we have actually donÂ© this there is
never a Jar to awaken us. The most
marvelous thing about Dickens' art was
its power to create an artificial world and
to manipulate it so that the illusion la
never broken. Admit this littlo world and
all else follows; Dickens becomes a trua
humorist.
The secret .of Dickens' artificiality lay
undoubtedly In his temperament. His
sensibilities were exceedingly responsive.
He was Celtic in disoosltion. mercurial,
demonstrative. This led him easily to ex
tremes; he exaggerated unconsciously and
magnified things that impressed him, He
knew London street life thoroughly and
he attempted to describe it truly, but be

Thackeray Is the last great figure
among the British humorists; he Is tho
only writer in the latter half century
worthy to stand with Shakespeare. Btsala.
Fielding, Goldsmith and Lamb as a hu
morist In the widest sensÂ© of the wprtL
Between Dickens and Thackeray as hu
morists there can be no comparison.
Lowell, our sanest and most discerning;
critic, has summed the matter up briefly:
"Thackeray. In his more elaborate works.
always paints character, and Dickens sin
gle peculiarities. Thackeray's personages
are all men. those of Dickens personified
oddities. Tbe one Is an artist, the other
is a caricaturist."
Thackeray's true humor Is hard to quota
In small quantities. It pervades a whole
chapter, a whole book. It is often more
of an atmosphere that envelops a work
than anything tangible and material, but
it Is seldom absent. Tbe reader of his
novels, especially of "Pendennls" and
"Vanity Fair," cannot miss It.
Thackeray has followed faithfully his
own prescription for humor. "ThÂ© hu
morous writer," he says, "besides appeal
ing to your sense of ridicule professes to
awaken and direct your love, your pity,
your kindness â your scorn for untruth,
pretension, imposture â your tenderness for
the weak, the poor, the oppressed, the un
happy. â¢ â¢ â¢ He takes upon him to be
the weekday preacher, so to speak." He
has beÂ«n called a cynic, and be was a
cynic, as Tslcoll observes, "If by the word
we mean onÂ© who Is apt to look on Ufa
with a glance half sad. half humorous;
who Is prone to be distrustful of fine ap
pearance and professions: who sees keenly
the grains of dust mingled In the koH of
tbe finest character, and who is fully
aware of the latent meanness and selfish
ambition which often lurk under actions
professing to be nobla and generous."
The extravagazfee and broad comedy of
Thackeray's early work appear less and
less in his later writings. In his novels
he followed the footsteps of Fielding. He
wrote with "the eyÂ© on the object" and ha
reproduced lifÂ© with wonderful accuracy.
He had the rare power of znaJctncr his
characters alive; we seem to see them be
fore us almost In the flesh. He sympa
thizes with them, he laughs at their
weaknesses ' and foibles and holds up to
our ridicule their snobbishness and folly.
Tet be Is ever perfectly sane; he seldom
caricatures, he never ridicules life. His
humor la subtle and delicate; his pathos
is sincere and telling.
If ever our cousins, the Smlgmags, asked mÂ«
to meet Lord Longears. I should like to take
an opportunity after dinner and say. la tha
most good natural way in the world: "Sir.
Fortune makes you a present of a number of

The "Book of Snobs" Is a burlesque en
society. In it Thackeray for the first tlmo
voiced a note that was to dominate much
of his work. He detested shams and Â©vary
form of Insincerity. "Call things by their
right names," he cried; "do not grloss over
the villainy of Lord Steyne because ho Is
a lord; do not condone George Osborne's
selfishness because he Is handsome; don't
pretend to be what you are not. and do
not let false shame make you conceal
what you are." The result was satire not
fierce and merciless like Swift's, but
human and kindly, like Steele's and Field
ing's. He was "thÂ© gentlest of all English
satirists." yet he feared no one; he could
assail even the nobility, who are so wor
shiped by Englishmen:

sketches. It was in Punch that hÂ© first
published his "Snob Papers," "Jeanle's
Diary," "Punch's Prose Novelists." "ThÂ©

pers. In all of them wit and broad fun
run riot. HIb burlesques of the popular

As to the quality of Dickens' humor
there is room for honest difference of
opinion. Few other writers have ever
called forth such a. chorus of widely dif
fering criticism. On th<Â» one sldÂ© ara
those who declare that his humor is sim-
This reaction came In full tide in 1538
with thÂ© publication of "The Pickwick
Papers." In this novel. If It may be called
a novel. In "Oliver Twist" and subsequent
works Dickens professed to give a minute
study of London life, especially in those
humble circles which he knew so inti
mately. The result was phenomenal.
Dickens became in a moment the most
popular of all English writers, a title
which he has never for a moment lost,
and he was hailed as the greatest of all
English humorists save only Shakespeare.
Following these early realists, however,
had come the romancers who built an ar
tificial world and peopled It with Impossi
ble creatures leading imporslble lives.
There was not trua humor in the wild ro
mances of the last years of the eighteenth
century. Humor comes only from, closÂ©
contact with actual human life. The first
significant reaction came with Jane Aus
ten and her refined sketoheu of humblÂ©
life. Then came Sir Walter Scott, whoso
half-reali3tlc, half-romantlo creations
postponed the realistic revolt for nearly
a quarter of a century.
There are two worlds In Scotf s novels,
even as there are in Shakespeare's plays â
thÂ© nobility and thÂ© common people.
When the novelist treats of humble life he
does it realistically, with, bis eye upon
the object. His homely characters and
scenes are full of lifo and feeling; he
wrote of them as if he lovsd them and
he made their little lives Infinitely tender
and truly humorous. "In dry humor,"
says Hutton, "and in that higher humor
which skillfully blends thÂ© ludicrous and
the pathetic so that It Is hardly possible
to separate between smiles and tears
Scott is a master," but it must not ba for
gotten that Scott, when ha was romancing,
when ho left the humble llttlÂ© world ho
loved so well for the medieval castle and
royal court, was seldom a humorist. His
influence, on the whole, arrested rather
than advanced the realistic reaction which
was to bring thÂ© novel back to ltfa and
true humor.
EL
Â¦ The wit and fun of thÂ© present day arÂ©
voiced and recorded for thÂ© greater part
by thÂ© comic pressâ by periodicals like
Punch, and by the weekly newspapers,
nearly all of which have departments "In
lighter vein"; the humor of thÂ© period Is
fcund most largely in thp novels and
tales, which are, perhaps, the chief liter
ary product of the era. ThÂ© realistic
novel of manners, first discovered by
Richardson in the mid-eighteenth century,
had proved to be a most wonderful ve
hicle for the comic and the humorous. It
surpassed the drama of the Elizabethan
days and the periodical essay of SteelÂ©
and Addlson, for it came very close indeed
to actual human life; it could draw man
and manners in the minutest details and
so manage that the reader -would seem to
be almost in the presence* of those of
whom he read. Fielding 1 , one of the
world's great humorists, had made use of
no other literary form, and Smollett and
Sterne and Goldsmith had donÂ© with It
their most telling work.
With the name- of Dickens Is always
coupled that of his great contemporary.
Thackeray, yet no two writers could differ
more completely. They have hardly a
single point in common. Thackeray began

WINTERS, Dec 14. â The retrospect Â¦ of
the season's output of dried fruits in this
district is encouraging. The speedy and
profitable disposal of the crop -has been a
source of satisfaction also to producers
and packers as well as to tho Inevitable
contingent of commission merchants and
middlemen. Prunes, which have become
a veritable drug ,on the market, offer the
only exception.
Though Winters has lone been the cen
ter of a considerable fruit producing belt,
the last few years \ have been an era of
awakening on the part of business enter
prises, and men have begun to see the im
portance of being the custodians of their
own Industries. For five years thÂ» Win
ters Dried Fruit Company has been an
Incorporated Institution operated for the
public interest as well aa for the interest
of the stockholder. The gradual improve
ment of Its warehouse and facilities for '
handling the frultB each year evidences
the practicability of the dried fruit busi
ness as a local industry.
Following is a table taken from a type
written report supplied by Manager F.
W. Wilson of the Winters Dried Fruit
Company, giving the exact amount of
dried fruit shipped from Winters this sea
son:
XMe4 apricots .......M......M...1.XS1.6S8 pounds
Dried peaches 770,039 "

IMed prunes .......-., ........... 96,140 "
Dried nectarine* â 778 "
Almonds 151,164 "
Total 2,441,913
This total of 2.441,916 pounds, or almost
1300 tons, was handled mostly by this
packing company, and shipped almost ex
clusively in neatly packed packages of
twenty-flve and fifty pounds each. Mr.
Wilson says that three times as much
fruit has beer exported from Winters this
season as ever before in her annals as a
dried fruit center.
During 1 July alone 14,300 packages of
choice and fancy dried apricots were sent
from Winters direct to. France. Holland,
Germany and England. Below is a state
ment of the exports for July:
800 packages dried apricots, 24,800 pounds,

In August seven more cars of apricots
were exported, with 4200 packages. Dur
ing the same month two > carloads of
peaches were exported to France. The
peach output this year was comparatively
light, but the quality in general has been
excellent and previous to the present date
they have commanded a good marke. The
lifelessness of the industry at present,
however, offers little inducement for mov
ing a considerable amount of fruit on
hand.
Mr. Wilson's estimate of fruit on hand

Dried figs ......150,000 "
A new departure in the industry is the
utilization of the kernel of apricot pita
for chemical purposes. - The Winters
company shipped over 2000 sacks of whole
pits this year, though liltle attention was
given to them in the early part of the
season, they not being recognized as a
valuable part of the apricot crop.
This amount, however, is small, as com
pared with the amount handled by J. C.
Campbell of this place.
Prunes at present form the bulk of fruit
on hand. About 350 tons are held at this
place In the Winters Dried Fruit Com
pany's warehouse by the California
Cured Fruit Association., pending sale and
removal. These prunes have been graded
and inspected according to the associa
tion contract. The larger part of them
run from 80-90 to 90-100 and 120. A good
portion, however, run all the way from
50-60 to 70-80.
The dividend declared on the prune
sales for October netted the local mem
bers of the association a reasonable price
for their prunes and demonstrated the
fact that the association benefits the
snjall producer as well as the large one.

SAN JOSE. Dec. 14.^A sad case of
criminal degeneracy was witnessed In
Judge Lorlgan's court to-day when Noah
Wasielewski, alias "Nogee" Wasielewski.
stood up for sentence on tbe charge of
passing eaws and files into tho County
Jail for the purpose of aiding in a break
of prisoners. The prisoner, who is but 24
years of age, has been for the past ten
years In almost constant trouble- with the
police. When a babe in arms ho wit
nessed his mother's murder at the hands
of his father, and when the crime was
discovered the child | was crawling about
tbe floor in its mother's blood. For this
murder, which was a most brutal one,
his father, Juan Wasielewski, paid the
penalty upon the gallows. In the early
'80's the boy's parents lived at LoÂ« Gatos.
Jealousy on tho part of the husband led
him to kill his wife. He stabbed her
thirteen times. Wasielewski escaped ar
rest for several years, but was finally ap
prehended in New Mexico. He was
brought back here and executed.
The boy has been knocked about from
pillar to post and has" associated with
criminals of all classes. Although arrest
ed for felonies many times he has escaped
conviction, but has served several terms
in the County Jail. A couple of months
ago he completed a term there, and a few
days later called and passed a number of
saws and files Into the jail. Frank Wal
ters Eugene McCabe and William Brown,
confederates of Wasielewski. were con
fined there. A jail break had been planned
and with the tools supplied by Waslelew-
Bkl It was hoped to escape. When Sheriff
Langford" unearthed the plot one of the
bars of a window had been sawed through.
The sawB and files were found, and a con
fession of the prisoners connected Wasie
lewski with the crime.
A conviction followed Waslelewski's ar
reBt, and to-day he was sentenced to Ban
Quentin for a term of two years.
This was a tort of retribution day in
Judge Lorigan's court. George Hoffman,
who looted S. F. Lelb's residence, was
sentenced to five years in Folsom prison.
Ed Duckgeischel, his accomplice, who Is
17 years of age, was not sentenced, and
will probably be sent to the Whlttler Re
form School.
Herbert Brown, a boy of 17 years, who
with Ralph Heywood stole a wagonload
of furniture from a house near Campbell,
was sent to Whlttler. Heywood probably
will go to State prison.
Two years In San Quentin was given
Felix Vehrein for burglary.

NEARLY KILLED
BY BEING HAZED
CHICAGO. Dec. 14.â Frank Lust, a stu
dent in the Northwestern University
Academy,* was hazed !ast night by twelve
students. He was taken from the univer
sity gymnasium, where he was practic
ing, to a secluded spot on the lake shore.
There he was blindfolded and his clothes
removed. A coat of black ink and soft
soap was then daubed over his entire
body. After the treatment of ink and
soap the students lined up and compelled
him to run the gauntlet. He was passed
from one to another of the crowd and
each one took occasion to slap him about
the body. After fifteen minutes of this
kind of treatment he was wrapped up in
blankets and taken to his home on Sheri
dan road. The young man waa nearlv
overcome from exposure and from the
hard treatment he received, and fainted
while being taken to his home. The stu
dents, however,- managed to revive him
before he was taken to his room.
Last week Lust received a threatening
letter signed by several fictitious names,
in which he was asked to watch out for
dire treatment.
All the hazing bajid wore handkerchiefs
over the lower parts of their faces. Tho
clothing they wore was old, but despite
this fact it is thought the victim recog
nized several of his tormentors.
This is the se<jond student at the acad
emy who has been hazed within the past
week. Last Friday night F. H. Sandmeyer
was \1sited in his room by a half-dozen
students and treated to a coat of fly
paper.
iJr. Herbert Flake, principal of the
Northwestern University Academy, re
turned to Evanston yesterday and will at
once commence an investigation of the
hazing of Sandmeyer.
I>r. Piske will be assisted by the North
western University faculty and states
that the affair will be sifted to the bot
tom. None of the faculty, so far as couli
be learned late last night, had heard of
the hazing of Lust.

tions to taking him on the part of the
China, but the local authorities are deter
mined that he shall go.
Kawalhao Church, the oldest church in
the Hawaiian Islands, celebrated its sev
enty-fifth anniversary last Sunday. The
church was organized in 1825, land being
donated to the missionaries at the time by
King Kamehameha. At first services
were conducted on the site in grass
houses, but in 1839 the corner-stone was
laid. In it was placed the first printed
copy of the first edition of the Bible pub
lished in the Hawaiian language, and is
sued only twenty-nine days before the
laying of the stone. The church building
is the largest here. The church has had
but three pastors during its career, the
present one. Rev. H. H. Parker, having
served for thirty-seyen and a half years.
In the congregation on the occasion of
the celebration, which took place last
Sunday, were daughters of all three of
the pastors. Among the features of the
celebration was the presentation by the
Rev. W. D. Westerveldt of a Hawaiian
flag from Oberlln College, which used the
flag in decorations last summer, and sent
it as a greeting.
The Mormon church here is also pre
paring for a great anniversary celebra
tion, the occasion being the iiftieth anni
versary of the landing of the first elders
on Hawaiian soil. The eiders were Presi
dent Lorenzo Snow and Counsellor George
Q. Cannon. They are both expected to
arrive here in time for the anniversary,
which Is December 12. 1 he religion they
introduced here now has about GuOO adher
ents, nearly all natives, in Hawaii.
Honolulu is still disturbed by the ques
tion as to whether President Mc-
Klnley contemplates declaring void all
land sales and leases made here
since September 2S,. U99. by the local gov
ernment. In spite of denials, the Hono
lulu Republican continues to assert that
suits are to be brought in behalf of the
National Government to annul all such
leases or sales. The paper states that Me
legal documents for such actions are now
being prepared and will soon be filed. The
sale ot public lands at Olaa is the princi
pal deal involved. At the present time
there are squatters on the lands, who re
fused to leave in spite of the order to do
so, followed as it was by a public sale.
An attempt by several purchasers to take
possession resulted in their being driven
away by gunfe in the hands of the squat
ters. They base their claims on the con
tention that the local government had no
right to dispose of any public lands aiter
September 2S, 1S99, on which date Presi
dent McKinley gave his last instructions
in the matter, ordering that no more land
deals be entered into. The enabling act,
however, gives the local government con
trol, according to the contention of those
who ordered the sales.
A treasury department ruling In the
matter of Chinese citizenship has created
excitement and surprise among the Chi
nese population here. It declares that
the Chinese who were naturalized citizens
of the Republic of Hawaii did not become
American citizens by virtue of the provis
ions of th-Â» territorial act. Section four of
that act declared that "all persons who
were cltUens of the Republic of Hawaii
on August 12, 1899, are hereby declared to
be citizens of the United States." Under
this section Chinese citizens of tha late re
public were supposed to be Americans,
and they were allowed to vote on the 6th
of last month. If the Chinese in question
an? not Americans they appear to be men
without a country- They have forsworn
allegriance to China, and were citizens of
the Republic of Hawaii, but there is no
such republic in existence now. The ques
tion arose here when some of the sup
posed American citizens wanted to leave
Hawaii for the United States. Collector
Stackable wrote to Washington and re
ceived the new ruling on the 20th of last
month. Attorney William A- Henshall,
who has several Chinese clients who want
to travel as American citizens, has ap
pealed to the Treasury Department. The
number of Chinese who come under the
ruling as citizens of the late republic is
small, but they are mostly wealthy men
of long residence here. .'
Porter J. Conway. saJd to be very much
Â¦wanted in Salt Lake City for embezzle
ment, has been spending a few days in
Honolulu, under the name of George
Clarkson. according to several people who
have recognized him. He arrived on the
steamship Mariposa from San Francisco,
having eluded the detectives there, and
he has now taken the Bteamship Dorio
for the Orient. High Sheriff A. M. Brown
says that he is absolutely certain that
Clarkson is Porter Conway. but that there
was no way to hold him here, as there are
no papers from Utah. For several days
after he was recognized" here by a man
who had known him at Salt Lake, Con
way was in town on the public streets
sÂ»nd the police were powerless. Conway is
said to have been a forger and embezzler
last month, in Salt Lake, after cutting a
wide swath as a business and soclety
rnnn. and the amount of his haul is placed
at over $13,000. He was being watched for
at San Francisco, but in some way passed
on board the Mariposa.
The first wireless telegraphy message
ever sent to Honolulu from a vessel at sea
was received to-day from the yacht La
Paloma. which has been chartered by the
telegraph company to \islt the various
stations and make the needed repairs. To
day she sent messages from the open sea
near Molokai, and received replies. Tnd
stations on Oahu and Molokai are no-w
in successful communication, but so far
Honolulu has not been able to reach the
other islands.

LONDON', Dec. 14.â A epecial from Su
Petersburg says: Prince Khalkioff, the
Minister of Railroads, to-day rave the
correspondent of the Associated Press a
complete outline of the railway projects
which are now under way or are seriously
considered,. A new line nearly 300 kilo
meters, or about 200 miles, in length has
just received the approval of the Council
of State. It will be a Government line and
will connect the basins of the Dpn and the
Dnieper rivers, paralleling the line to
Vekaterinoslaf and running some distance
south of this line. The Yekaterlnoslaf line
is crowded with grain trafllc. The cost will
be 15.000.GDO or 20,000.000 roubles. W ork will
be begun next spring.
The road from Orenburg to Tashkta. will
be 1900 kilometers, or between 1200 and 1300
miles long. It will be begun at both ends
at the same time. The total cost will be
about SO.OOO.OOO roubles.
The line from Sesterosk. on the Finnish
border, will be given a St. Petersburg ter
minal next year. Work will also be begun,
according to a recent decision, upon the
St. Petersburg branch of the Great Sibe
rian line, which will join the Moscow line
in the Ural passes before reaching Cne
laybinsk.
A private company is seeking a conces
sion for a line irom the Dnieper valley,
beginning near Necicopol or Alexandrovsk.
to Odessa, with a total length of 610
versts, or something over 410 miles. The
surveys have been begun.
Another company has long been asking
for a concession for a line from Yalta to
Sebastopol. but it is hardly thought this
will be granted, as the road will have to
pass through the Emperor's property. It
was proposed that electricity should be
substituted for steam as motive power,
but the Emperor still objected, and the
line will probably ultimately be built
more to the eastward, running from Yalta
to Simferopol.
The Siberian railway will prdbably be
completed from Stretensk to the Chinese
frontier within a few months. The Gov
ernment also hopes to complete enough of
the line around the Lake of Baikal to en
able the boat to make its crossing twenty
miles shorter before the end of the year.
The entire loop, with a length of 290 kilo
meters, or nearly 200 miles, will "cost about
40,000,000 roubles.

Wabash as well as the Erie Railroad,
thouRh their exact nature has not yet

<"utlincd* it may be said that the plan of
the Arbuckles is to build a new refinery

to and adjoining the present one in Brook

HIST0BY OF THE CASE.
The. Morrison murder caee haÂ» been one
Â«f the- most Intertttir.gr in the annals of
Kansas crimes. The principals were
Jessie Morrison, daughter of M. H. Mor
rison, formerly Probate Judge; Mrs.
Clara Wiley Castle and Olin Castle, the
latter e husband. All came of prominent
families who bad lived tn the county for
the past quarter ot a century. Miss. Mor
rison and CaÂ«tl3 were clerki In a "rack
et ' store and before he married Clara
Wiley Castle paid attentions to the pris
oner. It was shown in the trial that
much jealousy existed between the two
women. Mies Wiley and Castle were mar
ried in June last. On June 22 the women
fought with a razor In Mrs. Castle's
house. The latter died of her wounds
eighteen days later. In a deathbed state
ment by Mrs. Castle ehe charged Miss
Morrison with entering her house on pre
tense of Ehowbig her a letter, of talking
in a threatening manner and then islasa
ir.g her with a razor, which the defense
tried to show she had abstracted from
a showcase In the racket store. MlÂ«s
Morrison's plea was self-defense, and on
the stand she declared that Mrs. Castle
bad called her into the house and attack
t<i her and made It necessary for the de
fendant to cut back to save her own life.
Miss Morrison was last July indicted
iter murder in the nrst degree and haÂ»
â¢Ince been refused bail. It took five days
to secure a Jury, over four hundred men
having been subpenaed. Each side pre
sented about forty witnesses and eight
lawyers were retained. The taking of
testimony consumed eleven days' time
and the arguments were begTin Saturday
morning. The defendant fainted In her
cell on Wednesday night after a fit of
fobbing, and cried once in the courtroom.
It was feared that she would break down
before her testimony was heard, but on
the day the prisoner took the stand she
displayed rema-kable nerve and coolness.
She recited the details of the terrible
death Ftrugirle without hesitation, and
underwent the rlg'd cross-examination of
the State's attorneys without show o?
fear. Since tliwi FhÂ© has grown brighter
and stronger as her hopet of acquittal
arose.
Former Judre Morrison has been at his
daughter's side constantly during the
trial, which has dally attracted great
crowds of people. Sunday, surrounded
by her relatives. Miss Morrison spent the
time In her cell singing and praying-,
â¢while Olln Castle Joined a party of hunt

THE LITTLE SICKNESSES
1
Which Grow Into Big Ones.
A little cold In the head Is a trifle, but If
neglected and It hangs on from week to
week and gets Into the throat and lungs it
is no longer a trifle. It is then no longer
a slight cold but the beginning of chronic
catarrh.
Do not make the mistake of thinking you
have no catarrh because the head and
nose appear to be clear. If there la cough,
tickling in the throat, hoarseness or a
sense of oppression In the chest you have
throat and bronchial catarrh. If the ap-
petite is poor, nausea, gagging and dis-
gust for food, especially in the morning,
you have catarrh of the stomach.
The surest and safest treatment for
every form of catarrh is an Internal rem-
edy which acts especially on tha blood
and mucous membranes.
Such a remedy is the new catarrh cure,
eold everywhere by druggists under name
cf Stuart s Catarrh Tablets, a medicine in
pleasant, convenient tablet form and con-
tair.lng all the best and latest specifics for
catarrh, Â¦whether located in nose, throat
bronchial tubes or stomach.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
of Sangulnarla, guaiacol. Red gum and
similar antiseptics which destroy the
germs of catarrh in the blood, and no one
who suffers from any form of catarrh and
has seen the uselessness of sprays,
douches, and powders will ever .go back
to them after once trying so convenient.
pleasant and harmless a remedy as
Stuart's Catarrh tablets and one which
gives relief in so short a time.
Even in cases where catarrh has af-
fected the senses of smell and hearing,
these tablets accomplish a cure because
the blood being cleansed of catarrhal
germs, the mucous surfaces of the nose
and throat no monger clog up the respira-
tory passages with catarrhal secretions.
All druggists sell full sized treatments of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for the nominal
price of 50 cents, and the regular daily use
of them will effectually cure this trouble-
some and dangerous disease.

lowing specified organizations:
All central labor bodies affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor.
All unions directly affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor.
All unions affiliated with central bodies
chartered by the American Federation of
Labor.
All unions affiliated with tho American
Federation of Labor through their nation
al bodies, provided that no union be ad
mitted to this convention except It be af
filiated with the central labor body, char

bor and having jurisdiction in Its locality,
where such central body exists.
Central bodies shall be entitled to two

such as the anti-injunction, child labor,
employment agency, employers' liability
and blower system bills, which have al
ready been Indorsed by a large number of
local bodies, will be discussed and steps
taken to secure their enactment by the
Legislature. It Is claimed the sentiment
already expressed by Senators and As
semblymen give assurance that the views
of the convention on these matters will
meet the approval of the State â¢ law

strong measures will also be taken to

IN THIS CITY SHORTLY
First Day's Session Devoted to Head
ing of Papers and a Social
Gathering.
The storm interfered greatly with the
first cession of the annual convention of
the State Woman's Suffrage Association,
which opened yesterday morning at
Golden Gate Hall. The attendance wos
not ui> to the standard established by
previous conventions, but what the ladles
lacked In numbers they made up In en
ihuFlasm.
Mrs. Swift, president of the association,
occupied the chair and there were present
many representatives from local and
county organizations. Reports were read
from interior clubs which were very en
ou racing. A communication Â¦was r<?
<-( ived from the Los Angeles Woman's
F-jfTrage League declaring its sympathy
for the State association.
The only pacer read was the one by
Mrs. Kmma Shafter Howard Mrs. How
*r<*. advocated that the suffragists might
aivance their cause by taking part in all
conventions agitating live and timely
subjects. After Mrs. Howard's paper and
in the informal rathoring that followed
the lady's able address was commended
by Mr?. L>aura <1e Force Gordon, Mrs.

CHIEF OF THE CHINATOWN SQUAD IS TOLD BY A- GERMAN WAIT
ER HE CANNOT EAT UNTIL HE SHOWS THE COLOR OF HIS
HONEY.
With the air of a man who had sud
denly come Into the possession of vast
riches. Brophy ordered the waiter, who
was a German and a recent arrival in
this city, to "bring on a porterhouse
steak well done, smothered In onions, and
a bottle of cool beer to wash it down "
After sizing up the sergeant the waiter
concluded that he was a professional
"beat." and he so notified the proprietor
"Tell him that It will coat him fifty
cents," roared the latter, "and get a.
glimpse of his money before you serve
him. The waiter, following the instruc
tions of his employer, timidly approached
Brophy. â¢ '
"I dink you was a beat," spoke the
waiter, addressing Brophy. "You gets no
porterhouse here 'less you pungle up
first." - ...
Angered beyond measure the 'little ser
geant" displayed his star and in language
that could not be mistaken he ordered
the waiter to serve him. , The latter fear
fully admitted his mistake and apologized
to Brophy for thinking that he was a
"beat," but the sergeant was not easily
appeased.
After finishing his meal Brophy stepped
out to the counter to pay for it, but his
wrath had not yet subsided and ho
slapped down a silver, dollar and strode
out on the street without waiting for his
change, oblivious of the fact that he had
paid double price for his "swjell" meal.
PORTO RICANS
DESERT BOSSES
When the session was called to order
Regent J. B. Reinstein. of the board of
trustees appointed to take charge of the
competition of the plans, read a report of
the board. In his report he referred to
the letter Mm written by Mrs. Hearst in
which the subject of a comprehensive plan
for the establishment of a series of build
ings was taken up, and In which she of
fers to stand the expense of the competi
tion by which the best talent obtainable
In the world could be brought to a consid
eration of the scheme. Continuing, the
report summarizes the preliminary work
of the competition, the competition itself
and the methods by which the winning
plans were selected from among the num
ber that were submitted. The report con
cluded with a complimentary address to
Mrs. Hearst and with the formal presen
tation of the plans to her.
The meeting of the Regents was for the
purpose of considering the plans and it
took them but a few minutes to decide
that those submitted were the best ob
tainable, and they were adopted uanl
mouFly.
At a meeting of the Regents of the State
University held yesterday afternoon, the
plans of Monsieur Benard, the successful
competitor in the Hearst architectural
competition, were submitted to the gov
erning body and were accepted. The plans
arrived Thursday from Paris and had
been placed en exhibition in what was the
dining-room of the old Hopkins mansion.
There are four sheets containing eight
plansâ a section through what the plan
proposes as a continuation of University
avenue, a view of the hill topped by the
observatory, a plan of the university
jrrouniis. a topographical map of the
grounds and four crops-sections showing
the different slopes of the hill. There
Is In addition a pheet with three draw-
Ings in detail, one a birdseye view, one
a specimen column, and a third, by
far the most characteristic of the wh"!c
group, a view of what is intended to be
the avenue through the middle of the
grounds just at the point where the bot
anical gardens will make it most beauti
ful.
More Than Thirty Purposely
Miss the Hawaiian
Steamer.
In the excitement thirty or more of the
exiles became separated from the band
and when the boat steamed up to the
wharf to take the crowd aboard many
were found missing. This created some
confusion, but there was no holding the
steamer. About eighty were taken aboard:
the remaining thirty-eight are now In this
city, and those who tiave not already
fallen into the hands of the police or some
charitably inclined person are probably
wandering aimlessly about the city. They
have no money and it is only a question
of hours before all will become charges
on the city.
The exiles cannot speak nor understand
English, and thoEe who have become sep
arated from- the band are nkely to have
trouble trying to make themselves under
stood. In fact, their utter helplessness
became evident last night when nine of
the unfortunates were picked up at the
corner of Third and Harrison streets l>y
the police and carried to the Hall of Jus
tice in a patrol wagon. There were four
women in the party. They wore given a
night's lodging at the City Prison.
From an Interpreter it was learned that
the thirty-eight who missed the boat did
so intentionally, having been induced to
desert their companions on the strength
of luring promises of better treatment
and higher wages here. rÂ»one of them ap
pear to be In a starving- condition and for
wanderers without a home they are a
pretty happy, contented lot. Fully one
half of the thirty-eight are boys ranging
In age from eight to 15. Some of the men
carried small bundles of clothing tied to
the end of a stick, which was swung over
the shoulder. These little bundles consti
tute their entire personal effects.
The eighty who boarded tne steamer
will probably go to work Immediately
upon their arrival in Hawaii. They are
to receive $20 a month, and In addition
will be furnished with a living place and
all the necessities of life will be given
them free. What will become of those
who remained behind Is a question, on
less arrangements can be made to have
them sent to Hawaii on the next boat tne
city may have to take a hand in looking
after them. Indeed, it. looks as If tnal
would be the case anyway, or until such
time as transportation can oe provided.
The Porto Ricans complain of not very
good treatment In their native country
ar.J they are glad to withstand any kind
of hardship rather than remain In Porto
Rico. They are not under written con
tract with the Hawaiian sugar firm and
none of them was compelled to go aboard
the steamer unless he chose. They now
appear to be sorry that they did not Join
their companions.
The majority of them are very poorly
dressed. -
The special train carrying the US Porto
Rlcans, en route to Hawaii, where they
will be employed by the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters" Association, arrived at Oakland
from Los Angeles just before noon yes
terday. The motley aggregation was at
once hustled off to meet the steamer Rio
de Janeiro, which left her dock at 1
o'clock bound for the Hawaiian Islands.

>=^ ERGEANT OF POLICE BROPHY
(V^^ had an experience last Thursday
â <7\ night that is amusing to every-
but himself. Brophy, while
not a dude, has always prided him
self on being one of the best-groomed
men In the department. Recently he was
assigned to duty In Chinatown, and fol
lowing the example of his predecessors
he resurrected an old suit of clothes, a
Flouch hat and a blue flannel shirt that
his father wore, and, donning them, pre
pared to do battle with the criminal
classes of the Chinese quarter.
While the Chinese looked with awe on
the sudden change in the appearance of
the "little sergeant," as he is familiarly
known, Brophy completely ignored them,
even to the point of threatening a few
of the more Inquisitive with his club.
Thursday night, after successfully raid
ing several "joints," Brophy shook the
dice with himself to see whether he would
go to tho expense of eating a porterhouse
steak or take a chance with his usual
evening diet of toast' and coffee. Luck
was with him, and after ordering his
equad to return to their respective sta
tions Brophy went to the California Mar
ket with his mind preoccupied with the
thought of the extra expense attached, to
the "swell" meal that ho was about to
order.
Olaf Andersen, residing at 721& Minna
street, attempted to commit suicide yes
terday forenoon by stabbing himself in the
right breast with the blade of an or

wounds on his body. He was removed to
the Emergency Hospital In the ambulance
and treated by Dr. BunnelL ,
Olaf Andersen Attempts Suicide.
plan has not yet progressed as far as de
tails. It is a grand conception, however,
for not a tree, not a stream, not a shady
nook nor picturesque corner has been sac
rificed, and all that nature has done for
the gentle slope from peak to bay has
bren made part of the plan for the greater
university.
The plans having been inspected the Re
gents convened again and on motion of
Regent Hellman the plans were adopted.
By a subsequent motion a special commit
tee was provided for which will fittingly
express the gratitude of the Regents for
the generosity of Mrs. Hearst which haa
made the whole scheme possible.
The plans having been accepted, Regent
Reinsteln submitted a motion providing
that they should not be changed in any
material particular except by the consent
of a majority of a board composed of the
committee of award and Charles P. Mc-
Kim, Professor D. Despradello, John M.
Carrere and John Galen Howard,- all
prominent in the world of architects. The
committee of award is composed of J. S.
Pascal, R, Norman Shaw. Dr. Paul Wal
lot, Walter Cook and J. B. Reinsteln. By
the terms of the motion this board Is
made self-perpetuating. The motion was
carried, more, however, as a sense of the"
present board in accepting the plans than
as an action binding on successive boards.
Its object Is to protect as far as possible
the plans as they were adopted.
It Is not possible to estimate how long
It will be before the plan as adopted will
be put In effect, nor even when It will be
started. It will be formed round the min
ing: building as a nucleus, however, for
Mrs. Hearst will donate that building, and
she says she will have the men at work
on It as soon as an architect can get out
the working plans. This will be about
next May.
At the meeting yesterday C. E. Fryer
was appointed reader In history for five
months at a salary of $30 a month and
Dr. H. C. Meyer was appointed an hon
orary fellow in agriculture. It was an
nounced by President Wheeler that at the
next Charter day President Arthur T.
Hadley of Yale would deliver the address.
MISTAKES THE SERGEANT
FOR A RESTAURANT BEAT
Mrs. Hearst briefly replied to the report
of the committee as follows:
It Is with sincere gratification that I ac
cept at the hands of the trustees the completed
plans of the greater university we all trust
the near future may see. And now, Mr. Presi
dent and members of the Board of Regents, I
submit these plans for your approval, and, I
hope, for your acreptanee. In thus severing
my connection with the trustees I desire to em
phasize my appreciation of their Intelligent,
earnest and enthusiastic work, rendered Indi
vidually bit! collectively, and I avail myself
cf this public opportunity to express my
thanks to ex-Governor James H. Budd. Profes
sor William Cary Jones and Hegent J. B.
TteinEtein.
The plans being thus finally before the
board, the Regents took a few minutes to
examine them and listen to comments in
explanation. As at last submitted to the
Board of Regents the plans are not nearly
so extensive as those by which Benard
won the competition. They have all the
difference between plans that would ro
qulre $100,000,000 to carry to successful
completion and plans that may not take
more than $8,000,000. The scheme is a flex
ible one, including as -much as possible of
the natural -beauties of the location and
all its physical charm, at the same time
presenting a system that may be modified
In many particulars without in any man
ner destroying the general scheme that
found so much favor in the eyes of thoso
elected to judge.
From the observatory on the hill, high
over the university grounds, the view is
down past classic buildings, gorgeous
columns and fountains and spacious
squares. Through the center runs Uni
versity avenue, entering as a street from
the city Into the grounds, developing at
once Into a grand causeway, then Into a
luxuriant grove, and then striking the
foot of the hill. It becomes a greensward
that sweeps up the slope to a plane that
looks far out beyond the Golden Gate to
the far distant horizon, where the blue
of a thousand fathoms of water and a mil
lion miles of sky . meet and merge.
The buildings are all low and solid and of
the same general style. So far, however,
the style has been only Indicated. The

Water and Forest Association Elects
Officers for Ensuing Year and
Adjourns After a Success
ful Convention.
The convention of the Water and Forest
Association of California terminated yes
terday, and If the plans of the body are
carried out the future should witness a
remarkable Increase In the waters of thÂ»
State and in the acreage of its forests.
The most Interesting part of the pro
ceedings, was an address by W. H. Mills,
who had facts and figures at his fingers'
ends to show that unless steps were taken
to prevent the cutting of timber In Cali
fornia a period of commercial depression
would surely result. Mr. Mills eald la
part:
I have been asked to speak to you on tho
subject of the forests and water supply of
California, and there it not a ' more vital sub
ject before the peoplÂ© of our State. The de
struction of our forest lands has resulted In
climatic changes and our rainfall has grown
considerably less. The earth is the source of
all wealth and Is the true source of empire,
end agriculture is tho world's foundation.
When I was recently in Paris I was impressed
by the pitiful showing made by Spain, which
at one time was mistress of the world. Do
jou know what first started the decline of that
great nation? I will tell you. It was the cut
ting of her valuable forest lands and the con
sequent decrease In her â¢ rainfall. Without
moisture agriculture languished and the whole
fabric of commerce fell apart. la California
we depend on agriculture, and the conditions
at present must be changed, in that a stop
must be put to the cutting of our timber,
which causes a decrease In our supply of
water. Â¦ England Is no longrer the great ex
porter of the world, for her coal supply has
diminished. That little country, on account of
her fuel deposits, had a producing capacity of
Â£00.000.000 men. When she finds that her coal
Increases In price the capacity of production
will decline, for the Increased cost of power
comes out of the profits of Industry. In 1890
calculations were made that America could
supply the whole world with coal for the next
hundred' years, but a study of the statistic*
for the past ten years and the Increase tn our
population shows that In twenty-five years our
coal supply will be exhausted, that Is If tho
ratio of increase In machinery and people con
tinues.
I quota these figure* to you to ask you not
to relax your efforts to secure the preservation
of our forests, which are the life principle of
our very existence. Not only must wo protect
tho trees standing, but we must take steps for
the planting; of new forests. Germany has 35,
000,000 acres of forests planted by the Govern
ment, and In consequence she has conserved
the rainfall, - Increased ber Industries and haÂ»
advanced from a fifth-rate power to one of
first rank. In twenty-five years Germany will
to the greatest commercial power In the world,
and It will be due to the very questions we
have discussed here for the past two days.
You have no idea of tho ruthless destruction
of Umber In this State. Thlrty-flvo million feet
of lumber were cut last year In tho MoCloud
Valley, and this Is only one Instance of what
Is being done In the way of bringing' this State
to ruin. Aa England's prosperity declines on
account of her coal deposits becominr- smaller,
bo surely does ruin stare us in tho face in this
State because of the decline In our rainfall
due to the destruction of the forests.
At this very time nearly half a million of
young trees are being cut by tho vandals of
commerce, who sell them for use as Chrestmas
trees. A, man who cuts down one of these
young- trees In order that he may make a few
cents should be sent to the penitentiary for
the rest of his life. The States of the Middle
West are denuded of their timber and the time
is coming when tho Pacific Coast States will
be looked to to furnish the needed supply.
We need not put a stop to the cutting of all
timber, but we must take such steps that for
every tree which Is cut another shall be planted
In itt place. Let us hope that tho time is
coming when California shall have tho proud
record of being the great forest country of
the world.

The committee on resolutions presented
a number of bills for presentation to the
Legislature, which were adopted by the
convention, all the bills following the line
of the resolutions presented during the
first day of the convention. A feature of
yesterday's meeting was the cordial feel-
Ing expressed by all the speakers In the
work of the association, and the majority
of the speeches were more in tho line of
seeking information as to the resolutions.
The bills adopted were for the amend
ment of the present laws governing the de
struction of forests by fire and to provide
stringent measures for the detection and
punishment of the offenders by fine and
Imprisonment; for the consolidation of the

appropriations of $250 000 for Irrigation
survey by the geological department, and
$100,000 for the Department of Agriculture
for the same purpose in this State: for
legislation to permit irrigation districts
organized under the "Wright Irrigation law
and which have a bonded or other indebt
edness to compromise and liquidate such
Indebtedness in any equitable manner as
may be agreed upon between such dis
tricts and their creditors;- for the storage
of flood waters and for the withdrawal
by the Federal Government from public
entry of all lands utilized for storage pur
poses; -for the withdrawal of all timber
lands from private entry, and to provide
for proper forestry system.
On motion of Llpplncott of the Geolog
ical Survey a resolution was adopted that
Congress be requested to provide that res
ervoir and canal sites be withdrawn from
public entry, as provided by law, by the
director of the Geological Survey, and that
said sites may not be renled upon by in
dividuals or corporations until relin
quished by said director, and that when
such sites are renled upon with the per
mission of the director of the Geological
Survey all persons refiling on the sites
shall be required to give sufficient bonds
for the proper completion of the proposed
work.
Congressman-elect Frank Coombs brief
ly addressed the convention on similar
lines to those expressed by Mr. Mills, and
after President Thomas had thanked the
convention for having re-elected him to
office the convention adjourned, subject to
the call. of the executive committee.

A Queer story of the sta resulted.
Two if the crew oi the bark. John
Baumkirk and William Bellie. were called
lo the stand. They stated that after the
tkath of Captain craigen they looked one
day down through the skylight in his
cabin, to aid their imaginations in their
r::us:r.gs over the fast and unfortuna'.o
life he led aboard the vessel, when great
was their surprise to see Mate Green sit
ting at me table counting over piles of
fold. Mr. Dnxty went deeper into the m-
destination and endeavored to show that
the amount of g-old the Bailors saw" was
about 16000, but they had no Idea of the
amount. There was a pile of It. they
said, and ihat was all they knew.
â¢'1 looked down through the .skylight
and saw him counting the sold â I am sure
tt was gold," said Baumkirk. "Thre^
other tailors who recently shipped again
and are now at sea saw him count the
gold. I could not tell whether or not It
was In Enelish or American coin, but I
could tell that It was gold."
Sailor Bellle took the stand and corrob
orated Baumkirk. He told in detail how
they watched the counting: of tho sold
and when this work was ov^r they re
treated from the skylight and resumed
their duties.
Mate Green was called to the stand and
at once entered on a denial of the story.
"There were a few souvenir coins m
the cabin and that was a_l," said Green.
If the sailors saw him handling coin It
was the souvenir coins and nothing more,
he thought. After a long examination thÂ»
witness finally admitted, however, thai
St had been Captain Craigen's usual cus-
TÂ«>rn to carry considerable treasure on the
vessel. As Green was positive in his de
nial that any pold was found by him save
the coins mentioned, a continuance Â¦was
taken, until next Tuesday. In the mean
time Drary and Lynch will search for
further evidence to support their belief
that thousands were on tiie vessel after
Captain Craiiren'e death, and that the
famÂ« has beer, unlawfully taken, away.
He Denies Their Story and Asserts
That They Probably Saw Him
Examining a Few Souve
nir Coins.
Sailors Swear They Saw
the Mate Counting Gold
in the Cabin.

THE FRUITS
Of Coffee Drinking.
"The fruits or result*, in my casÂ«, of
coffee <Srtnklng. were sallcxw complexion,
almost total loss of appetite, as well as
sleeplessness and slugplsh circulation.
"I was aJso very bilious and consti-
pated most of the time for eight yearo,
and became so nervous that I \ras unable
to 6o any mental labor and was fast ap-
proaching a condition where there would
have been no help for me.
"I am convinced that If T had con-
tinued using coffee much longer the re-
fjlt would have been a total mental and
physical wreck.
"I sometimes think the all-wiee Provi-
<5*>rice looks after us In trouble; at any
rate, when I was In despair a friend
urped me to give up coffee entirely and
uw PoPtum. giving the reasons why. It
was hard for me to believe that so eom-
racn a beverage as coffee was the cause
cf my trouble, but I made the change,
and from the first trial experienced a
benefit and Improvement. My com-
plexion has Improved, thÂ© nervousness
gone, as well as the bilious trouble and
e leepWsne*?*, and I am completely cured
of Flupglsh circulation. In fact. I am
well, and the return to health has been
directly traced to leaving off coffee and
using Postum Food Coffee. . I recom-
mend Postum to all coffee wrecks with-
out a single reservation."â James D.

has no interest in your case. He is merely trying to sell you some-
thing on which he can make a larger profit. He does not care
whether you get well or not, so long as he can make a little more

TCEW TOPJC, Dec 14.â The stock market to
day Illustrated again Its astonishing reslllrncy
and undf-rlyin* absorptive powers. The faith
of capital In the Intrinsic merits of securities
end In the country's prosperity could not have
b*Â«n more strikingly demonstrated than by
fueh movement as to-day. Wall street has
lived for some time past as In abounding con
fidence that the securities were bound to go up
after the fxigencies of the yearly settlements
had be-Â«n met and the money supply replenished
by a reflux of funds by disbursements of did
idend* of interest, but the large encroachment
making on the money market has caused a
dreaa that price* in the stock market were
lisble to be toppled over by a squeeze In the
money market and a forcing of speculative li
quidation. It was not until late to-day that a
rotation of the market enigma was offered In
the intimation that the losses by the banks
during the week which are conclusively shown
by the known movements of the money has
been offset by a gain of over $4,000,000 from some
local sources. This Intimation coming on top
of a series of favorable developments threw
the market Into a state of boiling animation
and buoyancy. The eager buying demand came
from all sources, professional bears who were
ehort on the market competing anxiously with,
the rampant bulls, who distributed their buying
orders with a lavish hand all through the list.
The contrast was a striking one with the con
ditions at the close last night, when not even
the â¢phenomenal advance In the Erie stocks
was able to overcome the uneasiness of spec
ulators over the palpable showing of absorption
by the Sub-Treasury of practically enough to
completely wipe out the surplus reserves of
the banks. The misplaced confidence of bear
operator* in last night'* selling was an im
portant factor In emphasizing to-day's advance.
The full Ftrength of the market was by no
means manifest In the early dealings, although
the outburst In the Wabash securities had a
fortifying effect. Even the Industrials and
Kjrf-r'altli-s which hung back in the early deal-
Ings recovered buoyantly to above last night's
close, fc't. Paul rose nearly 4 point* and a
long list cf railroad stocks advanced from 1 to
2 points. Just what Is the source of the special
movement of cash whlcn has oOset the week's
outgo to the Bub-Treasury is not definitely dle
cloeed, tmt ta* belief la jeneral that It Is
Treasure Shipment.

London Market.
NEfW YORK, Dec. 14.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was little doing In the markets here
to-day and the tone was dull, the newt of tha
reverse In the Transvaal suggesting that the l
war in South Africa Is still lively. Another
checking influence was the Interruption of ithe
Continental telephone service. In Americans
this was another "Erie" day. There was a
fair professional business in these securities,
but the price never attained your parity.
Nevertheless the New York spurt In Erles
strengthened the whole market until profit
taking In New York In Erie stock caused a
heavy close generally, although Wabash was
still wanted here, probably In sympathy with.
Eriea.
Silver was dull In the closing of the French
tender.

General debate was closed and the bill
â¢was read for amendment under the five
rninute rule. Payne, chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, from the
committee offered an amendment to make
the beer tax $1 60 per barrel flat Instead
Dl a discount of 20 per cent, as origrinally
oraun.
Newlands (Dem.) of Nevada offered an
amendment to reduce the tax to $1 20 per
barrel. TTcwlands' amendment was lost.
60 t6 127.
Sulrfr (Dem.) of New York charged that
the Republicans had obtained a large
campaign fund from the brewers upon a
pledge to repeal the $1 additional. tax upon
beer. They had been false to their prom
ise and he predicted that the brewers
â¢would repudiate them at the next elec
tion.
Payne's emendment fixing the tax at
Jl CO per barrel was then adopted without
division.
Corliss of Michigan offered an amend
ment to reauire the cancellation of
fctamps by perforation. Adopted, 123 to 23.
Its stated purpose is to prevent fraud.
Newlands offered aji amendment prov'd
ir.jE that every person, corporation or firm
enpaped in manufacture, whose grogs re
eeints exceed $300,000, shall pay an extra
tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent on 6uch
receipts above $500,000. The purpose of the
tax. Mr. Newlands paid, was to make the
preat trusts and combinations pay a por
tion of the war revenue. It was lost, W
to 113.
Dalzell closed for the Republicans with
a comprehensive speech of an hour.
Those who soupht the total repeal of the
war taxes, he said, seemed to forget the
fxtraordir.ary expense that might have to
be met in If>n2. They made no provision
for a river and harbor Mil. for big armor
putp contract?, for subsidies for the mer
chant marine, if the bill pending in the
fcmate should pass for the construction of
trie Nicaraguan canal and for the possi
bility that the Supreme Court might de
cide that the constitution followed the
ftag. in which event the United States
would have to refund all duties collected
Jn the ports of Porto Rico. Hawaii and
the Philippines. Better a surplus, he* said,
than a deficit. In his opinion It were bet
ter not to have gone beyond the $.30 000.0)0
cuÂ± recommended by the Secretary of the
Treasury. He said the J10.000.000 reduction
on beer had been ma<ie as a concession to
members of the floor. It would, he said
be unsafe to reduce that tax another dol
lar.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. H.-The
Houfe to-day adjourned without disposing
Â°, m Â° r^ n han half lhe war revenue reduc
tion bill. General debate closed at 2
o clock after which the bill was opened to
ciscussion under the five-minute rule.
A determined effort was made to redu<V
BtOJ further the tax on beer below th*
commercial rate of Â« 80 a barrel, but the
W ays and Means Committee overwhelmed
the opposition. The committee, however,
sustained two signal defeats. In connec
tion with the beer tax, Payne offered an
amendment to the language of the bill
3'asscd by the House last session, de
signed to abolish the use of small beer
packages, one-sixteenth and eighth bar
j^-Is, but It was defeated by 85 to S4. after
charges were mg.de that its purpose was
to crush out the small brewers.
*,D ca Â£ er defe &t occurred in connection
Jitn the amendment offered bv H. C
f^V 1 Qf Michigan. The bill abolished
t..e 1-cent stamp on express receipts and
telegrams, but retained the tax on rail
road and steamship freight receipts.
>mith s address restored the tax on ex
press receipts and altered the form of the
section so as to compel the company in
stead of the shipper to pay the tax. " The
amendment caused a lively debate in the
course of which Smith made a personal
alluplon to a United States Senator in
connection with one of the express com
panies. Payne vigorously fought the
amendment, but it was carried 123 to 106.
The text of the amendment is as follows
"It shall be the duty of every railroad
or steamboat company carrier, express
companv or corporation or person whose
occupation is to act as such to make
within the flrst fifteen 'days of each
month a sworn statement to the Collector
ot Intfrr.al Kevenue in each of their re
ypfctive districts, stating the number of
shipments received for carriage and
transportation, whether in .bulk or in
poses, bales, packages, bundles or not so
inclns^-d or included, for which any
rharize* whatsoever have been made, and
Tor each of such shipments received for
carnage and transportation the said rail
road or steamboat company, carrier, ex
press company or corporation or person
whose occupation it iÂ« to act as such
thall pay a tax of 1 cent."

Thus the tide of tourist travel has been
turned to California and the Southern
railroads realise that they have to .do
something extraordinary if they are to
get back their old time winter -travel, ir
through trains can be run from Chicago
to California, why cannot through trains
be sent from the Windy City to Florida,
the Southern managers argued. And Â»o
this winter, for the first time, luxurious
ly equipped trains of the latest Pullman
construction will run from Chicago to St.
Augustine. Fla., and the trip will be'made
in thirty-one hours, or seven hours leas
than the best time possible under former
schedules. The train will be run every
day In the week.
Meanwhile the roads to the Pacific
Coast are planning to hold "n to t
Western travel which they have de
veloped to so great an extent in recent
years. Besides first class Pullman trains
from Chicago, New York, Boston and
other centers, the Western roads will of
fer special colonists' rates to ! this city
from Eastern centers. These will be in
force in March, April and May, and be
sides the many who will take advantage
of these special rates there will be a bisc
influx of visitors who will attend the Ep
worth League convention^ here in July.
So all in all, local railroad officials ex
pect to be able to hold their own despite
the keen Southern competition:
The rivalry between railroads to Cali
fornia and Florida for tourist traffic
promises to be keener this winter than
ever before. For several years past
there has been a steady Increase in the
number of persons coming to the Pacific
Coast, while the travel to Florida an:l
other Southern points has suffered a cor
responding decrease. One reason at
tributed to the big increase in Pacific
Coast travel is the improvement in pas
senger service that has been made by
nearly all the Western roads. The be"t
equipped and most comfortable cars have
been provided and tne rates have been
brought down.

Captain Seymour ordered Strauss de
tained until this morning, when it is ex
pected the friends of Hirschfeld will make
a formal charge.
The day before Hlrschfeld committed
suicide he called on Captain Seymour and
told how he had been ruined by Strauss.
He had employed Strauss as a solicitor in
an advertising calendar scheme which
Strauss had proposed to him. He told th-j
captain that Strauss had many large or
ders, the contracts for which were slgnc.l
by i"K firms of this city, and that Strauss
would take the goods from the firm osten
sibly for delivery.
By accident he learned that his solicitor
had never delivered any goods, but had
taken order after order and Btored them
In his room. Later, .when Hirachfel-i
found that the contracts were forged ones,
he blew out his brains.
"I. felt that Hlrschfeld was going to
quit," said Strauss, "and I did not want
to take any the worst of It, so I thought
I would grab what I could out of the
wreck. I did what any other man would
do to protect his Interest in a "tottering
firm. As for Hlrschfeld losing $6000, that
is nonsense. Being a new concern, our
firm had "no rating, and my partner went
good to our creditors. What loss was in
curred Hlrschfeld took to heart. I think
he intended to kill me. but I was too
foxy." â¢
Strauss takes the affair lightly.. He said
he has been about town doing business
since Hlrschfeld's death and that he will
continue to' conduct the affairs of the
firm.
Strauss waa taken before Captain Sey
mour and made a statement in which he
declared that 'he was a full partner In
the advertising firm and not a solicitor.
He said he was unable to agree with
Hlrschfeld and as the mutual feeling waa
that a suit for dissolution was inevitable,
both he and Hirschfeld had been active
in getting for themselves individually
whatever they could out of the firm.

OAKLAND, Dec. 1*Â»^-George W.
Percy, the well-known architect,
of the firm of Percy & Hamilton,
in San Francisco, died very sud
denly .at his home, 318 Boulevard
Terrace, in tnls city, this morning. Mr.
Percy had not been feeling very well for
some time, but it was not regarded as se
rious. He had been in constant attend
ance upon his office and was there yester
day. He came home last evening com
plaining of a cold. This morning the
weather was threatening, and Mrs. Percy
prevailed upon her husband to remain at
home. Shortly before noon Mr. Percy was
seUed with a violent headache. Dr. Llllen
craotz was called, but before he arrived
Mr. Percy was dead.
The funeral will take place from the res
idence on Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
George W. Percy was one of the best

VIRTUE WIELDS
POWER OF MAGIC
Rabbi Nieto Preaches on
of Good Life
and Actions.
Rabbi Jacob Nieto made a forceful plea
for the Hebraic creed at Congregation
SUerith Israel last night. He compared
the Jewish faith to Wagner's heroine
Elsa, who, by her unconscious, attitude
toward her bitterest enemies, succeeded
in disarming their malice and in wielding
the "magic power of the conquest of
evil." The lecturer had bitter words for
the decriers of the faith and in com
menting on the general currency of false
reports concerning the Hebraic ritual
said: "In this world any tale, no matter
how bad or Improbable It may be, will be
believed, always providing its subject be
a woman or some religious institution.
These are the most helpless creatures on
earth." ,
In the course of his remarks the rabbi
also had little favor for those who would
insist on a strict rendering of the old
saw, "Handsome is as handsome does."
"Every great man," he said, "has a kink
in his character; not anything in this
world is perfect." The lecturer instanced
sunbeams, which, to be seen in their full
beauty, must be viewed through a prism-
Continuing he spoke in part as follows:
"If you will but try, and try earnestly,
to stamp out evl.1 it is then that a magic
power will be granted youâ the magic
power of the conquest of evil. You may
perhaps be accused by those envious of
your 'state of dealing in strange devices,
but you bear in your hand the wonderful
talisman of truth. The blood of a man
who has died for truth is never wasted.
It consecrates forever the ground on
which it falls. The Jewish religion
stands for truth and is therefore unas
sailable." Â¦'Â¦-!Â¦"/'*Â¦Â¦'â¢

Eastern Star Banquet.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â Unity Chapter of
the Eastern Star met at its new hall In
Oakland Tuesday evening, and after the
close of the usual proceedinsrs all re
paired to the banquet hall, where the re
mainder of the evening was passed In dis
posing of a splendid collation prepared by
Mrs. Adams and her committee, and in
social enjoyments. ' There was a delight
ful programme of cheery sentiments and
hearty responses. Mrs. S. M. Steels acted
as toastmaster.
A friend of mine has a half sister of

T. F. Carbine of Caledonia, Minn., has
either been foully dealt with while in this
city or he has suffered a remarkable lapse
of memory in the last two months.
On October S Carbine entered the Fa
loon of Tom Ferguson, 717 Market street,
and called for a drink.
Barkeeper Vincent asked Carbine what
he would have, and the latter requested
that a "bottle of wine" be opened up.
The bubbling vintage of_ France was
quaffed by Carbine as if it was water, says
Vincent, and with a casual look around
the saloon. Carbine said:
"This seems to be a pretty nice place;
I guess that I will leave some money here
for safe keeping."
Suiting the action to the word. Carbine
pulled five $20 gold pieces out of his pocket
and handed them to Barkeeper Vincent.
The barkeeper called Mr. Ferguson, who
took the money and prepared to write a
receipt for the amount. .
Carbine, who was under the influence
of liquor, threw another glance around
the bar and proceeded to pile more "twen
ties" on the" counter. Vincent advised the
customer to leave, some more of his mon
ey, seeing that he was likely to "go down
the line." and with a laugh the man from
Minnesota increased his deposit to $200,
receiving a receipt from Ferguson.
Carbine then left the saloon and that was
the last time Ferguson or any of his em
ployes saw the stranger. â¢
That a- deliberate attempt was recently
made by Borne one to secure the $200 left
by Carbine is shown by Mr. Ferguson'e
statement* made last evening.
"After 4his man Carbine left his money
with me I did not pay any attention to
the matter for some days, as customers
are in the habit of leaving money for me
to take care of." said Ferguson.
"But when days went into weeks and
he did not call, I made up my mind to re
port the matter to the police. That very
day, November 17, I received a lette.r from
Tracy, Cal., written on plain paper and
enclosed in a plain envelope. The writer
signed himself J. F. Carbine and asked
me to send on the $200 left with me on
October 8, and to forward the money care
of the Tracy Hotel. I was suspicious and
decided to write and hold the money. I
wrote to T. F. Carbine, care of the Tracy
Hotel, and acknowledged the receipt of
hls,letter, but pointed out that I wanted
to protect myself, and if .he would go to
Mr. Sharp, the proprietor of the hotel,
and get from that gentleman an assur
ance that he (the writer) was the man
who had left the money with me I would
forward the amount.
"I received no answer, and two weeks
ago the clerk of the hotel came to the
city on a visit and called to see me. He
said that a letter sent from my place of
business and addressed to T. F. Carbine,
cafe of the hotel, had been uncalled for,
and I then told him the story. He said
that no one of that name ever registered
at the hotel in November, and the name
was unknown in Tracy. The letter was
sent back to me a few days ago by Mr.
Sharp, as it had never been called for. I
shall report the .matter to the police anu
let. them work on tho case."
Inquiries made last evening show that
T. F. Carbine of "Caledonia, Minn., regis
tered at the Winchester House, on' Third
street, on- October 6 last. The books of
the house show that Carbine paid for his
room for four weeks and four nights and
then left, since which time he has not
been seen by the attaches of the house.
Carbine la described by Mr. Ferguson
and his employes as being a man about 37
years old, 5 feet 9 inches in height, heav
ily built and of dark complexion, with
dark hair and black mustache. He im
pressed Ferguson as being either a mining
man or a mechanic.

FAILS TO CALL
FOR HIS MONEY
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â The most
successful bit of music to come
from the jÂ»en of a local composer
Is "The Athens March." written
by Mrs. Eva E. Perkins of this
city. The march is one of the musical
numbers produced by the Hungarian Or
chestra at the Orpheum Theater. In San
Francisco, this week, and has attracted
considerable attention from the musical
critics.
Mrs. Eva E. Perkins is the wife of
Gecrge E. Perkins, the eldest son of
United* States Senator George C. Perkins,
and is well known in musical circles in
Rivalry Is Keen Between
California and Florida
Roads.
PROMISE OF HEAVY
TOURIST TRAVEL
Oakland and San Francisco. Mrs. Per
kins has written several musical- bits, in
cluding the "1900 Campaign March."
which was played extensively In the Enst
â¢luring the political campaign jupt .closed.
She then added "1 he Athens March" to
her list of compositions, and dedicated it
to Athens Parlor No. 185 of Native Sons.
Thi3 march proved so catchy and bright
that it was taken up by the Orpheum
management as the most successful new
music that they could secure.
The composition displays considerable
merit, and the musical friends of Mrs.
Perkins feel that she has much In store
for the music-loving community and her
self in this line.
AUTHOR OF "THE ATHENS MARCH," WHOSE. WORK HAS ATTRACT
ED THE ATTENTION OF MUSICAL CRITICS AND WHO IS SAID TO
POSSESS UNUSUAL TALENT.
The competition with our home products,
and especially the freedom of the Filipinos
to settle in the States; were causes of
alarm. The considerations, he said, might
very appropriately have had Influence
when the question of taking over the
Philippines was before us. but it was now
too late.
He agreed that the provisions of the
Spanish treaty, and of all treaties, were
subject to the constitution and could not
impair it, and if the islands became part
of the United States, in the sense of the
constitution, their people became citizens,
and the revenue clause, which was espe
cially under discussion in the Porto Rican
case, applied. He argued that the five
limitations in the constitution upon the
powers of Congress, whether expressed in
the affirmative or negative form, applied
to the exercise of that power in all places.
The very object in the section requiring
duties to be uniform throughout the
United States would be thwarted if for
eign goods might be admitted to Porto
Rica free, thence Into the United States
free. General Harrison especially dwelt
upon the liberty clauses of the constitu
tion as necessarily applicable to all civil
ized people owing allegiance to the United
States.
The occasion for the departure from
precedents was found, he said, especially
in the character of tho Inhabitants of the
Philippines. As to Porto Rico and Ha
waii, there would probably have been no
occasion for treating them otherwise than
wo have usually done.
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 14.-General
Benjamin Harrison delivered a lecture
this evening: before the Students' Lecture
Association of Michigan University. He
spoke upon the theme of the relation of
the annexed territories and their civilized
inhabitants to the United States. The
lecture was, as General Harrison de
clared, not intended to be a legal argu
ment on questions brought Into the dis
cussion of some of the views that have
been expressed in relation to the status of
cur annexed territories. JThe lecturer de
clared that we had done something out
of line with our historical precedents not
in the way of expansion, but in the char
acter of it. He said we had taken over
peoples rather than lands, as heretofore.
He held the view that the civilized inhab
itants of the territories were citizens of
the United States, and. that the revenue
provisions of the constitution relating to
exaction for federal purposes applied to
the territories. '
executors of 'the estate of the late C. F.
Crocker, have not decided to build a new
hotel in San Franctsco. Many report*
haie been circulated tor the effect that a
building to be used for hotel purposes
would be erected on the lots at Van Xesa
avenue and Suitor Street. Other rumois
designated the Calvary Church property,
at the northwest corner of Geary and
Powell streets, as th^ site of the magnlfl.
cent caravansary.
The fact that no decision has been
reached on the question of hotel building
does not signify a disposition on the part
of the executors to withhold Investment la
San Francisco. There are no indication*
that the great fortune which Colonel Fred
Crocker bequeathed to nis three children
will be transferred to New York. The re
cent marriage of Miss Mary Crocker to
Burton Harrison, a young attorney of
New York, ha3 caused some conjectures
concerning; future investment of money
derived from the estate. Mr. Harrison la
said to be a capable and prudent business
man. In all affairs concerning the estate
the executors rsk for his judgment. Ha
will \islt California next "May and lelsur*
ly study the Held of proposed investment.
After exchanging views with the execu
tors the subject of building and equipping
a modern, high class, fire-proof hotel will
probably come up for discussion and final
settlement.
The right of rich men and women to
invest their money wherever investment
promises the surest and best return is
not often questioned by Callfornlans. but
some of the old timers who worked har-l
and made great sacrifices in the develop
ment of the State contend that the wealth
which was produced in California shouM
be here invested and reinvested. The re
mark is often made that threats of hos
tile legislation in the constitution of 1373
caused the transfer from this State for
investment elsewhere of at least one hun
dred million dollars.
Bankers, who give the subject of In
vestment careful study, note that the rich
men of California are generally loyal to
the State. Loyalty in this regard is not
noted as one of the attributes of tho
wealthy Callfornian widow. The opulent
fair one prefers to take her money and
spend it abroad. Resident bankers are
surprised at the magnitude of sums sem'
annually and quarterly remitted from San
Francisco to maintain rich widows who
elect to. live In Europe.
A vast deal of the wealth derived from
the Comstock was invested in San Fran
cisco, but millions went to Europe. For
tunes acquired by the < great railway
magnates have been widely distributed.
The Crockers are loyal to California. The
University of Palo Alto stands as an ex
ample of the Stanford loyalty. The
property known as the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art is about all that Cali
fornia contains of the Mark Hopkins
estate. The estate of C. P. Huntingdon
adds but little to the taxable wealth of
California.

Richmond District Residents Take Action Against the Market Street Railway Com
pany's Scheme, ,
i s
Â¦will then equal If It does not exceed that of.
the ferry at the foot of Market street.
At the present time the people of Richmond
must pay Â¦ two fares on all lines In this dis
trict except -the Market-street Company's to
reach / Third and Townsend streets. Our only
hope Is that the California street, Sutter street
or the Geary street road may obtain a fran
chise to this new and Important â¢ point 'Â¦ of
travel. The . Market-street Company now has
itsf cars on Third street and its Fourth-street
line has Its terminal' at the west 'corner of
Third and\ Townsend streets. I
Should Â¦ your â¢ board grant this road a fran
chise on the two blocks applied for this com
pany will have a monopoly of all this travel.
As the Market-street Company has two of the
three terminals at this point they have all
they nee<i. The claim was made that this fran
chise was necessary to relieve the travel on
Third street. This can be easily done by di
verting parfof.the travel to the Fourth-street
line, and this : company = also has a line on
Brannan street and on Becond - street, from
Brannan to Market. Â¦ A - switch connects each
of these lines with Third street. -The Geary-
Street : franchise from Stockton street to First
avenue will expire Ir/Aprll, 1902. When a new
road Is constructed,' whether by the city or
private , persons, .' lt t will be valueless unless it
can ' reach the two gateways of this city â ths
foot of Market etreet and Third and Townsend
streets. .. v %:'Â¦'.
Therefore we respectfully protest against
your board granting any franchise to this com
pany on these two .blocks and ask that you
hold them for the use of the other roads of the
city that must reach this point^to accommo
date their patrons. Â» "* - -

. Richmond Improvement Association.
CHARLES H. HUBBS, President.
E. P. E. TROY, Secretary.
E.,P. E. Troy, a prominent member of
the association, In discussing the matter,
feald:
Although thlÂ« franchise calls for only Â» two
blocks, it Is probably the most valuable for
street car purposes that the city now has to
dispose of. Third and Townsend streets will' in
a short time be one of the two most Important
points of travel In the city. If the Board of
Supervisors should attempt to prevent every
road In the city except the Market street from
gaining access to the ferry there would be a
riot at their meeting. Yet the board Is now
taklnfr action that will give this company a
monopoly of the travel at a point where it
promises to exceed that of the ferry.
I cannot believe that the committee which
has act<*4 favorably on thle application can be
fully informed of its effect. They must have
been deceived. The California Ptreet. the Sut
ter i "I 1 "*' 1 '. ?* a , r y street and Ban Mateo lines
will be of little value unless they can land
passengers at Third and Townsend and prop
erty along their lines will depreciate In value
The Board of Supervisors should save for tho
city every" point, of advantage, as the express
declaration Is made In the charter that it Is
the Intention of the city to gradually own Its
public utilities. An opportunity will be given
to make a practical application of the charter
provision in April. 1902. when the Geary-street
franchise will expire. The present Board of
Supervisors, elected under the charter, should
not allow the Market-street Company to block
ade the city and render the wise provision of
the charter yold.
will appear at your board and express our fur
ther pretest against this action.

The Kosmos liner Neko is the fastest
vessel of the fleet. She came here from
Hamburg via the Straits of Magellan,
stopped at all the South and Central
American ports of call and still made the
run in ninety-eight days, thus beating al
most every other boat on the line by thir
ty days. The run was marred by her un
fortunate collision with the Crown of
Scotland and also by ihe running down of
a fishing smack while making port. The
Neko brings 600 tons of freight for this
port and seven passengers. â

trance, which would make thirty-four feÂ«t
of entrance.
Brandenstein wanted the proprietors to
postpone tho opening of the theater until
the matter was settled. McCarthy held
that this would be unfair to the owners,
who had expended larf;e sums of money.
Tobin thought advantage had been taken
of the resolution .which had granted a
permit for amusement purposes only. Mc-
Carthy argued that a theater was cer
tainly an amusement.
"If these people were allowed to go
ahead with thi3 building," said McCarthy,
"and the Board of Public "Works neg
lected to perform its duty by stopping
them In the beginning if it was not being
constructed according to law It is late In
the day for us to step in and rescind the
permit after the building is finished. I
say this action would be a hardship."
Brandenstein was of the opinion that
the building could be regarded as onÂ« re
modeled and In that event it would not
be subject to the stringent provisions of
the new ordinance.
Action on Kesolution Postponed and
Proprietors Will in Meantime
Take Every Precaution to
Insure Public Safety.
. >_
The Supervisors' Committee on Jndl
clary postponed action until next Wednes
day on the resolution granting the Cen
tral Park Amusement Company a permit
to construct additions to Its building on
Market street, near Eighth. In the faca
of,, the assertion made by Commissioner
Manson that the building* did not comply
strictly with the new theater ordinance
Fire Chief Sullivan informed the commit
tee that it was practically a sjfe building.
To a question of Chairman Brandenstein
Chief Sullivan said:
"It is a good structure and far safer
than some of the theaters you have now.
The exits to the main building are very
good, aggregating thirty-six feet. ThÂ«
main exit on Market street is only seven
teen feet and could be widened by remov
ing the piers. The only fear tha publia
would have would be this controversy.
I would suggest that the piers be removed
to widen the entrance and a steel girder
be substituted which would give a sweep
of twenty-two feet. The exits are far
superior to those In many theaters. Ther*
is a good exit from the gallery iato Cen
tral Park- : The walls would be slow in be
ing consumed in case of flre and the
building is what might be termed a slow
burning building. Theaters are safer now
than they ever were and more precaution*
for the public safety are taken. The fact
that the building stands alone Is an ad
vantage. In the strict sense of the word
there Is not a nre-proof theater in this
city."
Attorney Davis, for Belasco and Thall,
stated that the piers referred to by Chief
Sullivan would be removed immediately
and the exit made twenty-two feet wide.
Iron stairs from the gallery will be erect
ed* for flre escapes.
Chairman Brandenstein here stated that
the proprietors of the building should
note in writing what alterations have
been made and the committee will inspect
the building next week.
Chief Sullivan said that he would make
further suggestions to the contractors to
Increase the safety of the building and
promised to report the exact conditions.
"I do not wish to appear." said the
Chief, "as being in favor of this kind of
construction nor of recommending that
the Central Theater is 'dead' safe. Thouga
there are many exits an accident might
occur some time in the future."
Commissioner Hanson held that the only
safe theater was a fire-proof building.
The main entrance, he said, was not wide
enough and did not comply with the orÂ»,
dinance.
Superintendent Steve Simmons stated
that the contractors had never been noti
fied to make an entrance twenty-eight feet
wide. There was an additional entrance
twelve feet wide Just off the main en-

Its unique features have . attracted the atten

case of the United States of America vs.
the Spring Valley'Water Works, the Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company,
the Union Trust Company of San Fran
cisco and D. Ogden Mills, finding the
value of a certain tract of land belonging
to the defendants at $900 per acre.
The tract Is in this county, between
Lake Merced and the ocean. On the west
erly boundary Is a high bluff, from which
a good view of the ocean, fax out at sea
may be had. The Government desires to
take possession of the bluff and the con
tiguous territory, the whole having, an
area of forty-three and ninety-five one
hundredths acres. The tract Is to be used
for fortifications as an additional defense

the rest of the property.
The case was accordingly taken into
court and the Jury gave a verdict for $39,
555 for the 43.95-acre tract and $3900 dam
ages for the separation of the thirteen
acres, making a total of $43,455 which the

"As it has been held that tide lands
cannot be controlled by the State to the
detriment of the public welfare, as the
islands within the bay of an important
seaport are of great value to the public
and to the Government, and as it is ab
solutely necessary that the approach to
them must be unobstructed io make them
valuable, the court should hesitate to al
low the claim made by the defendant un
less supported by some clear statutory or
judicial authority, and In the absence of
either that Is satisfactory it must be and
is held that the lands surrounding these
islands were not within the denomination
of tide lands, and that the State had no
title thereto to convey."
The Dry Dock Company will take an
appeal. It has expended $300,000 in im
provements on Mission Rock and will not
give tnern up without recompense until
the courts of last resort shall have decid
ed against it.
"The question Is whether the State of
California had any right to what Is at
tempted to convey," says Judge Beatty.
"It cannot be doubted that tide lands be
come upon the demand of the State its
property. If any of the area surrounding
these rocks Is within the term 'tide lands?
it is evident from the testimony that but
a small portion thereof la. The State did
attempt to convey what under no theory
o? the law could be termed tide lands, but
which It conveyed as submerged lands.
If it could do so no reason exists why it
might not convey as submerged lands the
entire bottom or San Francisco Bay. If
the State can hold as tide lands the strip
around the islands which belongs to the
Government the Government would be ab
solutely excluded from its island posses
sions except by paying tribute to the 3tate
or its grantees.
Suit was brought by, the Government
several months ago in -the United States
Circuit Court against the California Dry
Dock Company to eject that corporation
from Mission Rock, the Government
claiming the rock as an island and there
fore Federal property, it being the pur
pose of the Government to .establish
thereon a coaling station. The case was
tried before Judge Eeatty sitting In the
United States Circuit Court in this city."
Judge Beatty in his opinion says that
on April 4. 1870, the California Legislature
authorised the sale of Alieston Rock to
H. B. Tichenor, and on July 11, 1872. Tich
enor received a patent from the State of
California for SW) feet square surround
ing the rocks, containing fourteen and
thirty-five one-hundredths acres exclusive
of the rocks.
An opinion was received yesterday by
United States Circuit Judge Morrow from
United Btatea District Judge Beatty of
Idaho declaring that Mission Rock in ,thÂ«
bay of San Francisco belongs to the
United States Government.

Paul Antoine, Vice Consul of France
and a member of the Bohemian Club,
shot himself in the right temple last night
in the room occupied by him In the Pearl
lodging-house, 571 Ellis street. The "ball
ranged directly across the forehead,
touching the br&in and producing a wound
that will probably prove fatal.
People in the immediate vicinity were
attracted by i);e sound of pistol shots,
and as they attempted to run up the
Ftairs they were mtt by a woman, vrho
asked that Dr. Chantrau of the French
Hospital be at once sent for. Officers Gar
diner and Jewells and a. man named Gold
ing, who resides in the vicinity,' found
Antolne sealed on the lounge, and the
Â¦woman, who had run upstair? before the
officers, kneeling at his feet. The woman
was crying hysterically:
"Par*, why did you do this?"
The room, which was a small one on the
top floor, was spattered with blood, and
the pistol with which the deed was done
was found lying about s:x feet away on
the floor. As saon as possible the wound
ed man was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where I>rs. Putnam and Chan
trau found it necessary to trephine the
ckull, removing a piece of bone as large
es a dollar. Little hope was expresse-i as
to his recovery.
The woman, who ni also taken to the
hospital, was' very reticent, and although
pressed by every one present to tell her
story, steadfastly refused. Antoine's
friends called her Blanche, and later she
admitted that her name.
Mrs. A. Sirauss. who keeps the house
where the deed occurred, and the lodgers
ia the house also declined to give any in
formation regarding the couple. Mrs.
StraufP paid that she had frequently or
dered the woman away, but that she per
sisted in returning.
Golding, who was one of the first on the
ecene. pays he was standing about a block
iiwa> when he heard two shots nred. He
ran toward the Pearl and went upstairs.
"When I got there." continued Golding,
"Antotse was sitting on the lounge with
his hends supporting: hie head, round
Â¦which s. towel na*i been lied. The woman
was lying at his feet moaning and say
ing, *J didn't do it, papa." "YVfty did you
do it, papa?' She talked about another
woman, but her words Â¦were incoherent."
Antoine's friends, -who called in num
bers at the hospital addressed the woman
as Blanche, but dechired. they did not
know her other name.
In one of the few moments that the
woman was calm she said that she had
been married to Antoine for about three
months, and that the license was on rec
ord, but fhe declined to state by whom
the ceremony was performed. She said
that she had known Antoine for about
three years, ond married him after secur
ing a divorce from a former husband
named Posen or Posener.
In order that a detailed statement might
be obtained from her phe was placed in.
the patrol wagon and sent to the Hall of
Justice. On the way down she created
quite a scene. At the City Hall she abso
lutely refused to answer anv questions.
and was locked up in the care of the mat
ron, and her name placed on the detinue
book until the result of the Injuries of An
toine Is known. He -will be removed to
the French Hospital this morning if his
condition will permit. The pistol was a
cheap revolver of the bulldog: pattern
and .28 caliber. Two chambers were dls
rharjred. but only one bul'.et entered.
Search will be made for the other bullet
to-day.

San Jose's Cash Basis Device.
J. D. Miner of San Jose said thatÂ«the
charter. of the Garden city had one dis
tinctive featureâ the cash basis. Five per
cent of the levy is set aside as a fund
not to be expended until it has reached a
sum sufficient to run the city live months.
The city is then to be declared to be on a
cash basis and this fund apportioned to
the several funds.
Joseph Hutchlnson asked Mayor Phelan
if any street improvement nad been ac
complished under the provisions of the
new charter. The Mayor said that there
had not: a great deal had been advertised,
but work had not been reached.

Agent Hazen and Operators Moffitt and
Montgomery, were taken before United
States Commissioner Heacock yesterday
and waived examination. They were held
for trial and their ball was fixed at $4000
each. Old man Frltch will plead guilty
and says that his son was not connected
with him in the making of counterfeit ten-
dollar pieces, but Agent Hazen has abun-
dant and convincing evidence to prove
that- the son knew what his father was
doing and assisted him.
