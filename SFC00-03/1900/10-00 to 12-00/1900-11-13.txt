TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.-Sena
tor Harris of Kansas, member of the
Isthmian Canal Committee of the Senate,
is one of the first national legislators to
arrive In Washington since the election.
He said to-day that he did not anticipate
any great delay in the passage of thÂ©
Nicaraguan canal bill, which, under a spe
cial order adopted late In the last session,
will be taken* up on December 10.
"I know of no disposition on the part
of ahy Senators to unduly delay the bill
or to offer amendments of a radical char
acter," said Senator Harris. VThe great
est danger of delay lies in the fact that
opposition may be expected from those
who favor ' the Panama canal route
rather than the Nicaraguan route. The
strength they will be able to muster will
depend to a very large degree upon the
report of the Walker Isthmian Canal
Commission. I understand that we are
to have a preliminary report by the com
mission by the time Congress convenes.
This report will contain the conclusions
of the commission, which is all we need."
Real Admiral Walker said to-day that
the commission was making satisfactory
progress, and would have its preliminary
report In the hands of the President in
ample time to be transmitted to Con
gress at the opening of the session. He
said this report would be full enough toi
meet all requirements of Congress, as It
would give all the conclusions which the
commission had reached. The admiral
will not discuss the conclusions of the
commission, but It Is understood that
both the Nicaraguan and Panama routes,
were found to be practicable from an en
gineering standpoint, and it is found that
tho cost of completing the Panama canal
would be practically the same as the cost
of. constructing a canal by the Nicara
guan route. The questions. to be con
sldered by Congress are, therefore, .which
of the routes is the most favorable from
a commercial and military standpoint.
and where- the most favorable terms as
to concessions and control can be ob
tained. It is expected that .there will bÂ»
a lively contest between tHe advocates of
the two routes, but unless a very strong
case can be made out for the Panama
canal It Is probable that the Nicaraguan
route will be adopted.

The President and Secretary Hay are
awaiting anxiously the result of the de
liberations of the Ministers at Peking.
Minister Conger wired that another meet
ing would occur on November 11, but no
advices were received from him, and it Is
presumed that It occurred to-day. It, is
evident, however, that the authorities are
not very much pleased over the develop
ments of the past few days.
Secretary Hay is very much irritated
over reports which have been put out
from Peking showing that the Ministers
are determined to punish' a great many
influential Chinese whom they find re
sponsible for the recent outrages and in
dicating that the Indemnity to be demand
ed will reach $600,000,000. The Secretary Is
extremely anxious to induce the powers
to submit demands which will be accept
able to China, and he does not see how
this will be possible if the Ministers insist
upon the decapitation of all the influential
men and the payment of an' Indemnity
which Is clearly impossible. The officials
are of the opinion that examples should
be made of those conspicuously guilty and
that the amount of indemnity should cer
tainly be not more than $200,000,000, and
much less if possible. It is pointed out
that if all the influential men are sen
tenced to be beheaded, they will, as a
measure of self-defense, inaugurate a re
sistance which will necessitate further
military operations, the end of which no
one can foresee.

ant General Miles, acting Secretary of
War, was advised to-day of the depar
ture for Manila of the last of American
troops under orders to leave China. The
American force now under General Chaf
fee's command consists of one regiment
of Infantry, the Fourteenth; one squad
ron of the Sixth Cavalry and Battery F
of the Fifth Artillery. The troops that
sailed to-day comprised one battalion of
Infantry, one squadron of cavalry and one
battery of artillery. The United States is
therefore in the position of having with
drawn its troops after the necessity for
their presence had passed. At' the same
time the protection of American interests
and the American legation is assured by
the maintenance of a legation guard of
1900 men. Minister Wu Is anxious that
this force shall be still further reduced,
and Secretary Hay haa announced his
willingness to comply with his wishes pro
vided other nations shall withdraw. But
there is no disposition on the part of any
of the European governments or. Japan to

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 12.â The ar
rest of T. P. Brady upon a Federal war
rant sworn out by F. O. Watts, cashier of
the First National Bank, has caused a
sensation here. The firm of Connor &
Brady, composed of J. H. Connor and T.
P. Hrady. wholesale grocers and liquor
dealers, made an assignment to-day and
the ancst of Brady followed. In this
connection the disappearance last July of
W. \V. Lea. an individual bookkeeper of
the First National Bank, is explained.
The- two are charged with collusion In
defrauding the bank out of $44,000. Book
keeper Lea left on his vacation July 15
last and at the expiration of his two
weeks' rest failed to return to his desk.
The bank officials held a consultation
with Connor & Brady. It Is stated that
Brady acknowledged the crooked trans
actions, taking all the lesponsiblllty upon
himself, stating that he had put the
money Into the firm's business, with the
exception of a small amount, which he
said he used as an individual.
By operating this scheme it Is allege!
that the two men drew from the bank
$56,000 in cash, but through the system of
entries had paid back, through the flrm'3
account, the sum of $12,000, leaving a net
shortage to the bank ol $44,000.

president.
Thornwood, the name of Mr. Villard's
country home at Dobbs Ferry, Is a mas
sive and handsome villa of stone and
brick, surrounded with spacious verandas.
As soon as Mr. Villard's death became
known the messages of sympathy began
to arrive.
Henry Villard was born In Speyer.
Rheinish Bavaria, on April 11, 1835.- His
great uncle, Theodore, famer of Julius
Hllgard, who became superintendent oZ
the United States Coast Survey, led a
migration of the family connection to
Belleville. 111., in 1835. His \father, Gus
tav, was in the judicial service of the Ba
varian Government and died as Judge of
the Supreme Court at Munich. ,
Young Villard was educated at schools
in Zweibrucken, Phalsbourg and Speyer,
but in October, 1S53. brok'e off his uirfver
sity studies and set out for the United
States, Intending to join the colony of his
relatives at Belleville.
Arriving at Belleville, he became a
newspaper reporter and continued in the
profession until ,1868. During these years
he served as a legislative correspondent
in Indiana and Illinois, as a political re
porter, representing the Lincoln-Douglas
debates, the Chicago convention' which
nominated Lincoln, the Lincoln campaigr
and later as a -war corresnondent an-1
European correspondent. Early In 1&S1
Mr. Villard acquired the New York Even-
Ing Post and the Nation.
In January, 1866, In Boston, he married
Fannie, the only daughter of William
Lloyd Garrison. In 1868 he was chosen
cecretary of the newly founded American
Social Science Association, having its
headquarters In that city, and did not
finally relinquish the post until 1871.
It was in the latter year that. whl!e
on a visit to -Europe, Mr. Villard began
his railroad career. He formed a connec
tion with Frankfort and Berlin bankers,
and in 1873 returned to the United States,
buying for the German bondholders the
property of the Oregon and California
Railroad Company and the Oregon Steam
ship Company, being made president in.
1875. He acted as one of the receivers of
the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company,
and later bought up the bonds of the
road. He later became interested In the
Oregon Steam Navigation Company and
the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany, of which he became president, aii-'
then formed the Oregon* and Transcon
tinental, with which he merged the two
other companies In a so-called blind pool
with the Northern Pacific, being chosen
president of the latter company. .
A few . years later the companies in
which he was Interested became so in
volved that there was a collapse. In whlc'i
he suffered very heavily. Returning to
Germany, he formed new financial rela
tions which enabled nim to repair his for
tune, and coming back to this country, he
started In once more ts a capitalist. In
1890 he purchased from Thomas A. Edi
son his electrical manufacturing interest.*,
and with the Edison Lamp Company of
Newark, N. J., and the Edison worka of
Schenectady N. Y., as a basis, organized
the Edison General Electric Company; of
which he became prealdednt. serving in
that capacity for about two years. In Oc
tober, 1889, he became chairman of the
Northern Pacific board of directors, but
the panic of 1893 again occasioned the loiÂ«s
of most of his fortune and led to his
'withdrawal from railway management.

admits the will to probate.
Mr. Bonner died July 6, 1899. In a will

the residue of his estate into 'four parts
leaving one portion each to his three
children, Robert F. Bonner. Frederick
Bonner and Mrs. Emma Forbes. The

dren. Robert A. Bonner and Lawrence K.
Bonner. The contestant alleged that the
instrument propounded as the last will
and testament of Robert Bonner, de

be admitted to probate, because he was
not acting as a free agent in executing it
and that he was subject to undue in

CONDITION OF

however, that Colonel Baird's letter con
tained positive instructions for him to be-
Kin suits at once to set aside every sale,
grant, franchise or lease made by Hawaii
Fince September 2Â«. 1K*Â». It is also in po-
Fiti<m to state nhsolutely that the instruc
tions to Mr. Baird were very imperative,
leaving him no discretion in the matter.
Attorney General GrigRR believes that the
granting of lands and franchises in Ha
waii by the Territory officials previous to
the organization of the Territory Is ille
gal, lie demands that the Territorial
Government be instructed to at once fur
riish a complete list of every piece of land
Fold, leased or granted and every water
franchise 'eased, sold or given away, to the
United States Attorney in order that suit
may bo instituted to set aside each and
t very one of such transfers.
United States District Attorney Baird
admitted that he fiad received a~ letter
trom Attorney General Griggs upon the
subject, but refused to say whether or
not it contained instructions for him to
becin the suits. . .
Congress exprt ss.y ratified and confirm

and he- has instructed United States At

aside.
At the meeting of the Executive Coun

before Mr. Dole and his Executive Coun
cil. The matter was discussed for some
time, and Attorney General Dole was in

TROUBLE OVER
HAWAIIAN LAND
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â Marcus
Daly . of Montana died: to-day
at the Hotel Netherlands.
Mr. Daly's death had been
expected fdr weeks. He came
borne from Europe about the middle of
September, and soon after was obliged to
take to the bed from which he never
again arose. His physicians informed tho
relatives some time ago- that Mr. Daly
could not recover and they 'would give
assurance of life only, from day to day.
Brlsht's disease, complicated with heart
weakness, was the cause of death.
At Mr. -Daly's deathbed were Mrs. Daly,
Marcus Daly Jr., his son; his daughters
Mary. Margaret and Harriet; trie Rev. M.
J. Lavelle; his attorney, William Scallon
of Montana, and two physicians. . .
Mr. Daly was conscious only at intervals
yesterday. At 4 o'clock this morning he
revived from a sinking spell and seemed
more than ordinarily, bright. . He asked
\that his family be summoned.
\- "Only a Jittle while more, a little' bit
more," he said, when asked if he was bet
ter. The family came hastily and re
mained until the end. Death came peace
fully. The physicians said Mr. Daly was
conscious until a few minutes before he
passed away.
His body will be taken to the house fit
725 Fifth avenue to-morrow. The funeral
will be held from that place, the services
Including a solemn high mass of requiem
In St. Patrick's Cathedral at 11 o'clock
Thursday morning.'
Marcus Daly was born in Ireland In
1S42. He came to the United States early
in life and since lo7S had been a citizen of
Montana. He became general manager fit
the Alice silver mine and later came into^
control of the Anaconda copper mine. At
the time of his death he was president of
the Amalgamated Copper Company. In
politics he was a Democrat.
The differences between Mr. Daly and
W. A. Clark have- attracted much atten
tion. The trouble started years ago over
some water rights near,Butte, which Daly
wanted and which Clark had bought,
forcing the other to pay a very high fig
wre. Daly's opportunity for revenge came
in 1S8S. when Clark was the Democratic
nominee for Delegate to Congress. With
his immense Influence at Anaconda. Daly
was able to throw a heavy vote to Carter',
Clark's Republican rival, which had pre
viously been cast for the Democratic
party.
Montana became a State In 1SS9 At the
first State election Mr. Clark was the
Democratic nominee for Representative in
Congress and J. K. Toole for Oovernor.
The latter was elected, but Clark was de
feated, supposedly owing to Daly's Influ
ence. Clark was then put forward for
the United States Senate. After a bitter
contest the Legislature was organized by
both parties, each claiming to be legal.
The Republicans named Thomas C. Power
and W. F. Sanders for their Senators,
while the Democrats put up Mr. Clark
and Major Martin Maginnls. The Repub

Daly's influence defeated Clark in a sec
ond contest in 1693. In that Legislature
the Democrats had thirty-five votes, the
Populists three and the Republicans thir
ty-three. The Daly Democrats, number-
Ing nine, voted solidly for ex-Congressman
W. W. DIxon, and there was a deadlock
for the entire session of sixty days. Tele
grams from men like Calvin S. Brice, W.
C. Whitney and others equally high in
their party were sent to Daly to with
draw his opposition, but he ignored them
and the fight continued.
The next fight between Daly and Clark
was on the location of the State capital.
Helena. Mlssoula, Bozetnan and Anacon
da were In the fight. Daly advocated the
last named place. Clark at first favored
Butte, but finally changed to Helena, and
that city was chosen.
The Senator-ship again became the bone
of contentlon'between the two milionalres
last January, and Clark was elected. Daly
had the validity of the contested
on the ground of bribery when Clark pre
sented credentials to the Senate. The use
of money in the election was freely ac
knowledged on both sides, though it was
claimed that the expenditures were for
legitimate expenses only. The contest re
sulted in the Senate voting that there had
been no election by/the Montana Legisla
ture.
This year Clark made a -fight for the
election of members of the Legislature in
his interest and won, and his return to
the Senate next January Is assured.

Montana. They Feocted a hill overlook-
Ing the lltt'o mining camp of Butte and
bpgart' to sink their shut t. ' They struck a
fji!r vein ot" silver, but lack of funds made
them stop work and oiler to sell. ' Marcus
Daly bought the property for $35.0CKÂ». He
arted, it is said, as agent for J. B. Haggin
of California, who had pert him to Butte
to buy some good mining property.
As the now owners ran their sr.aft down
they opened one of the world's greatest
copper mines, with silver enough to pay
all cxpensps. leaving; the copper as clear
profit. Daly was superintendent and part
owner of the groat mine. He bought the
ndjacent properties. He founded the town
of Anaconda in a valley twenty-five miles
distant, and located .where there" is an in
exhaustible supply of water and a great
deal of woodâ two indispensibles for the
smelting and reduction of ores. At that
place he erected the greatest copper plant
in the world. â¢ - Â¦ â¢

man, and several Western State Commit
tee chairmen met here to-night for the
purpose of conferring on a plan that will
prevent the reorganization of the Demo
cratic party and the disintegration of the
Bryanites. The conference was in the
nature of an executive meeting and the
only thing accomplished was a decision to
call upon all the Bryanite State Commit
tees to resist the reorganization of the
Democracy in their respective States a
circular being framed, reciting that,
though defeated tne followers of Bryan
are not discouraged and only need tlms
in which to get themselves together- i to
reappear before the public with all their
isms combined in a party under a new
name. Silver will be the nucleus of tho
new party." as four or five States can stlU
be counted on to support such a platform..
"What the name of the new party will
be I cannot say,", said Senator Pettfgrew,
"but undoubtedly Mr. Bryan w m De one ot
Its most earnest workers, though not nec
essarily Its Presidential candidate."
One reason why Senator Pettigrew is s->
active probably lies in the fact that a suc

The onjains: of the Maurice Grau opera
ftasrri at Morosco'* Grand Opera-house
Not ever the desecrating hand of the
librettist can rob the greatest love poem
ever written of all its pathos and of all
its power* This was sufficiently demon
strated by last night's performance of
"Romeo and Juliet" at the Grand Opera
house, where three acts of inaction. I
snatched piecemeal from the masterpiece !
of Shakespeare's hot youth, were followed
by a fourth act of real power (the quarrel
scene between the Capulct and the Mon- !
tague factions) and a fifth of genuina
pathos (the death of Romeo and Juliet Iti
the tomb). Wherever the vile doggrerelist
who mangled Shakespeare's play would
allow Shakespeare to speak he never
failed to attain his intended effect.
When Gounod composed "Romeo and
Juliet" "Lohengrin" had been in existence
more than fifteen years. Yet the French
composer seemed by that time to have
learned nothing from that "Wagner, who
(with all his womanolatry and his absurd
theory of opera as the keystone in the
arch of the art) must be allowed to be the
greatest master of orchestration the world
has ever seen. In the first three acts,
with the sinsle exception of the waltz
song, there is nothing that lifts itself
above the commonplace: in the fourth
act the chorus effects rise to some extent
1 with the theme, but only in the last act
does the music show real dramatic adap
tiveness.
Mme. Melba sang the part of Juliet with
that cold correctness which marks at once
the finish and the limit of her art. M.

essary to Make a

When the Board of Supervisors topk up
the canvassing of the vote of the late
election this afternoon Auditor Col and
Justice Cobb served protests on the board
against counting the vote for Auditor and
Justice. They maintained no vacancies
existed until January 1. 1903. and that they
had been appointed to fill terms which
did not expire until that time.
The Board of Supervisors, which is Re
publican, thereupon passed a motion not
to canvass the vote for Justice and Audi
tor. Richardson and Murphy will taxe
The same kind of a fight will be waged
over the County Audltorshlp, which A. G.
Col now holds under appointment of the-
Supervisors. Col was appointed to fill a
vacancy In the office. The Republicans
held in the case of Auditor as In the Jus
tice fight, and made no nominations.
Martin Murphy was elected to the place
by the Democrats.
To-day Oneal resigned the Justiceship,
to take effect Immediately, and the Su
pervisors at once appointed Attorney
Charles W. Cobb to fill the unexpired
term. This means a long legal fight for
Richardson, as Cobb will not give up tha
office.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 12.â A lively contest In
the courts over the office of City Justice
is promised and Owen Richardson, who
was recently elected to>the position on
the Democratic ticket, will not obtain the
place until the Supreme Court shall have
passed on the case. Louis Oneal, Sena
tor-elect from the Thirty-first District,
has held the place since the death of Jus
tice Gass a year ago by appointment of
the Board of Supervisors. The Republi
cans claimed Oneal held the office until
the general election in 1902. District At
torney Campbell also rendered a decision
to this effect. The Democrats took the
opposite view, holding that the office ex
pired the first of next January, and nom
inated Richardson. The County Clerk re
fused to put Richardson's name on the
ballot and he brought the matter before
Judge Rhodes on a writ of mandate. The
court held that the appointment by the
Supervisors held until a successor could
be elected at the election just held, and
ordered Richardson's name on the bal

Santa Clara Democrats Clash With
CONTESTS FOR. TWO OFFICES.
"Tn the case of Martin against the Elec
tion Commissioners, In which the main
point decided was that the charter was
"No part of this State," said Mr. Gar
ber, "can exist without a county govern
ment. The performance of the functions
originally vested solely In the county gov
ernment was never Interrupted in San
Francisco. The county has from the or
ganization of the State had its place in
the government of this city and county.
The separate and independent county gov
ernment was of course abolished when
the city and county was formed. But the
functions of the county did not disappear
with the strict county government. They
remained as before, to be executed by the
city and county.
"This was the situation as it appeared
to the Supreme Court when the so-called
county government act was applied to
San, Francisco. In the case of Kahn
against Sutro the court found that the
separate county government had been
long abolished, but that Its functions con
tinued to be executed by the authorities
having the dual character of city and
county onlcers.
The county of San Francisco Is there
fore a constituent part of the State, the
attorney argued, and as/a county is gov
erned by State laws. There^is within the
limits of the city and county of San Fran
cisco a dual government, a city governed
In municipal affairs by a charter and a
county governed, as are all other counties
of the State, by State laws. If any other
theory of government were to be applied
one would have to maintain that San
Francisco, since the ratification of its
charter, has seceded from the State and
Is now an independent political entity.
This theory on its face. Mr. Garber con
tended, is obnoxious to the constitution
and all laws of State government.
The argument made by ex-Judge Gar
ber was elaborate, technical and abstruse.
It was historical, logical and able. Its
main theme,. upon which all the lawyer's
excursions depended, was that the Legis
lature of California has not the constitu
tional right to abandon any of its powers
to any territorial subdivision within the
boundaries of the State. The Legislature
has the power to grant to cities the right
of self-government in affairs purely mu
nicipal, but it has not the power to dele
gate or abandon the duties of government'
placed upon it by the constitution.
The courtroom of Superior Judge Heb
bard was crowded yesterday morning to
the doors by lawyers, officials and promi
nent citizens, called to hear the conclud
ing arguments in the case which shall de
cide the meaning and the scope of the
civil service clause of the charter. John
Garber delivered the final address In the
controversy and contended that the Civil
Service Commission of San Francisco has
not the shadow of authority to dictate
the qualifications of purely county offi
cers who perform duties exclusively tor
the State. . '
In conclusion Mr. Garber contended that
when the Legislature of California gave
to San Francisco powers which it had no
right to. abandon or delegate It committed
an unconstitutional act. At the conclu
sion of the address Judge Hebbard an
nounced that he would hasten his decision
and the case was submitted. -
"Take the history of the State and we
find that .the original trovernment of thi3
peninsula was that of a county. In 1851
the county of San Mateo was carved out
of the county of San Francisco, and a city
nnd county government was substituted
for the old scheme of political organiza
tion. That government was carried on by
the consolidation act and it so exists to
day, despite the claim that the charter
cuts off all State authority.
"Indeed, the charter Itself acknowl
edges that a county, government exists
here. It strictly defines tlie duties of the
municipal officers, but leaves the author
ity and obligations of the county officers
to the Legislature, saying that these of
ficers shall derive their powers from the
statutes of the general laws of the State.
In that it admits there is after all a coun
ty government."
"As the situation now stands, to declare
that the charter controls all the officers
of this city would be to declare that San
Francisco has seceded from the State. It
would place it beyond legislative regula
tion. That was never the intention of tho
people. It was their purpose to give San
Francisco local government in municipal
affairs and in nothing else. No part of
this State can exist without a county gov
ernment. Such a government is the foun
dation of the primary division of thÂ«
State. It is so declared in the act defin
ing the counties. There this city is de
scribed as the city and county of San
Francisco, and its boundaries are denned
along the same lines as the boundaries of
other counties.
"The constitutional amendment known
an section 8V4. which permitted the adop
tion of the charter, admitted the existence
of the county officers denned in the de
cisions of the Supreme Court. It gave the
charter no more power. Had it intended
to do so it would have expressed its in
tention in express terms.
regularly adopted, the dual government
of the city was again acknowledged. The
principle in the case of Kahn against Su
tro was not abolished. Rather its exist
ence was fully recognized, and it was
plainly the opinion of the court that the
dual government continued under tha
charter. As an instance of the recognition
of the former decision it may be men
tioned that Justice Harrison, who wrote
the decision in Kahn against Sutro, signed
the judgment in Martin against the Elec
tion Commissioners. If. as the attorneys
for the Civil Service Commission assert,
the latter case reversed the former de
cision, why did Justice Harrison sign it?
Furthermore, it may be said that the
court afnrmed Kahn against Sutro in
three other cases. In two of them. Ste
veiia against Truman and Popper against
Broderick, the existence of a dual govern
ment in this city and county was recog
nized In express terms.

Owner and trainer Sam H'.Hreth pent
three from his aggregation of oqulne
star* to the post a.t Oakland rrack yes
terday. He was compelled to accept a
very short price, but each came home
"throwing the bits away." Gonfalon
trudged along over a mile and a furlong
in lÂ£Z& Rolling Boer made a set of
two-year-olds wonder what man"? town
he hailed from, and Wooster Boy, with a
catch on his back and under reÂ«?fed sails,
covered "a mile and a sixteenth in 1:45VÂ»
(equaling a coaM record), the fim mile
being stepped off in l:3$*i. Everything
favored fast performances, the weather
favoring of summertime and a track that
resembled the surface of a billiard table.
It came pretty easy for the talent, four
out of six favorites takins: purses, while
Pornplno. winner of the third event, was
a? well backed as any of the starters. A
large crowd was in attendance, and all
f-eemed possess* d of means.
Cnder the conditions of the mile and
e furlong run Gonfalon had only to
pick up Ifit pounds! and th*Â» books held
the three-year-old a 1 to 6 choice. Bull
nan took him out in front, and the tale
ha* no moral. H* won like a racehorse,

rising, took the place by less than a
length from the heavily hacked The
Bobby. Owensboro. at his first essay,

Wooster Boy gave his exhibition of
rapid traveling in the concluding number.
He had Domink-k ar.d ninety-eight
pounds in the saddle, and Dunblane and
Fune!!o to smoother. A 3 to 5 favorite,
neither of the last named starters ever
pot close enough to even establish tele
phone communication with the Hildreth

"Dag-grie" Smith's Horton looked the
b^tt of the fix starters in the mile sell
ing affair, and was installed a pro
r.nuneed choice. Nicely rated to the
ft retch by Coburn, the little chestnut
â¢won hands down from Ping and Sir
Kingston.
In a very close finish Mounce. astride
Fompino. snatched the six-furlong scram
ble by a nose from Asian. The latter
made all the running, only to lose oot
the last 6tride. J. Walsh waited too long

in third place.
Track Notes.
Handicapper Brooke assigned Rolling
Eoer 124 pounds in the San Francisco
handicap, at six furlongrs. for two-year
olds. He had a mediocre batch to sub
cue, and though shaken up. as usual,
through the stretch, won cleverly from
Articulate. Grafter ran a poor third.
Tim Murphy, one of the heaviest bet
ters on the Eastern tracks, got in town
Sunday night. Tim had a very success
ful ee&son booking and speculating both
*.t the Chicago, St. Louis and New York
courses, and began operations well at
Oakland yesterday by putting down a bet
on Pompino.
Tom Ryan will be here shortly with a
big stable of sixteen horses, among them
Count of Flanders, which, it is thought,
will stand training again. Nash Turner
cioes the riding and will be a welcome
addition to the jockey ranks.
Tim McCall, who books for George
Cartright; wa? a spectator and will take a
hand in the game before it becomess much

Herman Hoffman dropped in from St.

Hughey Jones bid Pompino up $500 after
the gelding had won the third event. The

J. W. Brooks was telling a good joke
*in himself yesterday. Some days ago,
after much importuning on the part of an

handicapper. and he was surprised to

The substance of the remainder of the
afternoon's testimony was that the Court
Commissioner. Shepard. who, before
Noyes. presided over the only court in
Nome, and the military were supporting
the "Swedes" against the American*.
That when an American jumped a Swede's
claim because the Swede was not a citi
zen the Jumper had to prove his title be
fore he could hold on. That in fact Nome
was being made a place not for Ameri
cans, but for foreigners, who were gath
ering all the gold they had found, and
who were keeping American citizens from
their own. The sentiment up there among
the miners, said Chlpus. was that they
should have a "fair Judge" and should
not be governed by the military. What
thev wanted was a "fair Judge."
"They didn't get the flag until you got
Judge Noyes," was Pillsbury's equally
facetious reply, and then Geary returned
to the business of the cross-examination.
"The constitution did not follow the flap
into Alaska under Captain Walker then."
said Geary facetiously In this connection.
Then Geary had th* witness tell of a
miners* meeting that was brokenupbythe
soldiers. They met quickly, Chipps said,
to reorganize the district, and there was
no occasion for the presence or the action
of the military authorities; but when he
lÂ»t slip the fact that the plan of reorgani
zation proposed Included the dispossessing
of several claim holders, the action of the
military was more easily understood.
Geary had the witness tell how the sol
diers ruthlessly put him off the discovery
claim under the rule Captain Walker, the
commandant, had adopted, and which by
inference Geary denounced, that Jumpers
must prove title before they would be al
lowed possession.
Before that. hdw*>ver. his contract with
the Knglish syndicate having expired, he
looked around tor locations for himself,
and finding that Discovery claim on AnvM
Creek was paying well, and that It was
located by men he thought were not citi
zens, he promptly vindicated his citizen
ship by Jumping it. He was told there
would be a flght over the title, but he be
lieved his title would stand before "any
fair Judge." This claim, with his others,
he turned over to McKenzie. Geary tried
hard to pet him to admit that McKenzie
refused the Discovery because there might
bo litigation over the title, but McKenzie
was evidently not refusing a good thing.
The witness could not remember that Mc-
Kenzle had ever refused to accept it. and
that he did not I? proved by the fact that
the claim wÂ»a deeded to him and that
afterward, when he knew he was to- be
appointed receiver over It. to comply with
the proprieties McKenzie deeded the claim
to Hubbard.
Then the weary witness was turned
over to Geary to give the other side a
chance to see what could be done toward
repairing the breaches his evidence had
made in their case. The cross-examina
tion did little good, however, so Geary
went into more general subjects.
Under his questions Chipps told how he
went to Alaska first as an employe of the
Anglo-Alaskan Syndicate, an English con
cern that was seeking to open up the gold
fields to their own profit. Chipps and
about thirty others were sent to Alaska
to locate claims wherever they found a
Â»- ely gulch or creek, and in pursuance of
this Chipps located fourteen before his
contract expired, and the others, he sup
poses, each located as many more. But
the English syndicate suddenly went un
der with the death of its Alaskan man
ager, a man named Gurllng. and so Chipps
looked around for some one else who
would take his claims off his hands.
He found McKenzie and the Alaska Gold
Mining Company.
that he had never met Noyes might not
be altogether true.
Pillsbury then took up the trip to Nome
and the conversations the witness had
had with Noyes." Noyes evidently talked
very freely to him. for one of his inter
esting communications was that Chipps
should have a receiver appointed, for the
appointment of a receiver would brlns
those fighting him to time.
Chipps was then made to tell of the
beach property which was held by the
company. He said McKenzie had the men
working- on the beach arrested for tres
pass and had them brought before the
Court Commissioner, and while they were
thus held he entered upon their claims
with machinery and started to work
them. The machinery was not suitable,
however, so the deal was not much of a
success. ,
Methods of the Alaska Gold Mining Company
Told by Robert Chipps, Director and
Claim Jumper.
It was a hard day for the Alaska Gold
Mining Company before Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. Robert Chipps, one
of its directors and one of the, Nome
"Jumpers," was on the stand and he was
compelled to tell a great deal that the
company would rather had been kept se
cret. His testimony contradicts the state
ment of Senator Carter to the effect that
he had never met Noyes. He also ad
mitted that the company, a concern cap
italized at $15,000,000. had Its office in Mc-
Kenzle's room in a hotel; that McKenzie
was the company; that McKenzie knew
Noyes would be appointed before the ap
pointment was made, and that McKenzie
held over half of the stock of the com
pany when he was appointed receiver of
the Discovery claim. More about the ut
terances of Noyes while on his way to
Alaska and of his intentions was brought
out, and before Chipps was ready for
cross-examination by Geary there was
not much of the reputation of the com
pany remaining. â¢
The whole of the forenoon was occupied
by E. S. Pillsbury in winding Chippa
around his finger. Chipps swore that he
was Introduced by Alexander McKenzie to
Judge Noye3 in Washington, D.C., about
two months or six weeks before he arrived
in Nome, and Koyes informed him that he
was a candidate for the .vacant Judgeship
In the Nome District of Alaska. He told
Chipps that Senator Hansbrough of
North Dakota and Senator Carter of Mon
tana were his friends and were assisting
him In getting the appointment. Chipps
afterward met Judge Noycs at Seattle
after his appointment and had many talks
with him there and on the steamer about
the mining legislation in which the wit
ness was interested.
From Chicago Chipps went to New York
with Mr. Hubbard of the law rirm of Hub
bard, Beeman & Hume. Alexander Mc-
Kenzie was organizing the Alaska Min
Ing Company, and Chipps sold his mine
to McKenzie, receiving In exchange JT5u
cash and stock in the Alaska Mining Com
pany of the par value of J300.00U. The
company was capitalized for Jlo.OOO.OuO,
McKenzie taking fifty-one parts of the
stock for himself arid friends, names un
revealed. and giving the remaining forty
nine parts to Chipps and others, who sold
their mines to him. Blakeslee, Slade. Wa
ters. Webster, Leonard, Fisher and Kes
ter of Nome turned over their claims to
tho company! taking stock for the same.
The office of the- company was Mc-
Kenzie's private room in a hotel in New
York City. The stock book containing
the certificates was put by the witness
into the custody of Kennedy. Todd &. Co..
bankers in New York. 'All the parties had
made an agreement with â¢ McKenzie and
Hubbard that the certificates of stocK
ehould not be taken out of tho book until
this fall.
The witness met McKenzie and Judge
Xoyes in Seattle with the whole court
staff. McKenzie came on the same train
from the East with Judge Noyes. On the
way to Nome from Seattle Judge Noye3
said that he had heard of these cases
and he supposed that Chipps would have
a receiver appointed. Judge Noyes recom
mended the employment of Dudley Du
bois and Thomas J. Geary because they
were good lawyers. After McKenzie haa
been appointed receiver he suggested to
Chipps that he should take back the deed
he had given to McKenzie and give it to
Hubbard.
"You were a dummy in that case; were
n'tyou?" asked Mr. Pillsbury.
"Well, rather," replied Chipps.
"You were merely a figurehead In those
proceedings after you got there and made
this deed to Mr. Hubbard?" persisted the
relentless Pillsbury.
"I might have been that," was the re
ply. "I don't know whether I was or
not."
The witness went on to pay that the
persons claiming the Lane property werÂ»
jumpers, and were to have stock in the
company.
Chipps said he met Hansbrouph and
Carter in "Washington and they were in
company with McKenzie and Noyes. The
four talked topether. This was brought
out by Mr. Pillsbury to show that the pub
lished statement by Carter to the effect

CONSTABLES PURSUE
AND ARBEST ELOPERS
Fresno Youth and Modesto Girl Ap
prehended and Returned to
Their Homes.
STOCKTON, Nov. 12.â "R. F. Smith and
wife, Fresno."
Thus wrote a young man on the Com
mercial Hotel register yesterday. With
him was a pretty girl. "R. F. Smith and
wife" proved to be none other than an
eloping young pair from the south. The
young man's right name was McCallum,
and he is said to have come from Fresno,
while the alleged wife was a Modesto
girl. â¢
According to the story, which was
known but imperfectly by the constables
who pursued and captured the erring pair,
the young lady did not return home at an
early hour Saturday evening, and on her
parents making inquiries they learned
that she had left on the train bound for
Stockton. Early next morning there were
two constables on their trail. One was
acting for the parents of the young girl
and the other for those of the so-called
husband. The arms of the law arrived
here in the forenoon and located the pair
at the Commercial. One of the consta
bles knocked at their apartments and the
young man answered timidly. He did not
know that the game was up until he
opened the door and the constable had
him cornered. The elopers were told to
prepare to be taken back on the next
train. In vain they pleaded; the officers
were obdurate. On<Â» constable took the
noon train on the Southern Pacific line
with the girl and the other waited for the
12:30 Santa Fe. on which he took the
young man back.
â¢McCallum said that they intended to set
married in Stockton, but admitted that
they had been outgeneraled, and that the
ceremony had been deferred too long.

LOSEB IN LITIGATION
AGAINST HIS BROTHER
Court Dismisses Carlos Arguello's
Suit for Valuable Property .
in San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 12,-iThe fight between
Carlos and James Arguello, the sons of
Don Luis Antonio Arguello. for the pos
session of a valuable piece of business
property in this city was ended in Judge
Rhodes 1 court to-day. The rich old Span
iard, who took an active part in the early
history of California, died a few years
ago at Santa Clara. Before his demise
he deeded most of his property away, in
June, 1SP5. he gave James Arguello a deed
to the Luis block on First street, near
San Fernando, reserving a life interest
for himself. The property is worth $50,
000 to $75.'.hio. On the death of the father
Carlos Arguello, the oldest son, who had
not received as much as the other chil
dren, began a suit to have the deed to
James set aside on the ground that James
had influenced his father against the
plaintiff, and that the old don had not
the legal capacity to make the deed. This
suit was lost on demurrer, and then his
attorney filed another on the same
grounds.
When the second suit was ready for
trial before Judge Hyland Carlos Arguel
lo's attorneys dismissed It and filed a new
action. In this they alleged that the deea
to James ArKuello was only one of trust
and was with the understanding that at
the death of the father one-half of the
property was to go to Carlos.
The- sarre tactics of dismissing the suit
wore tried again to-day. When the case
was called before Judge Rhodes It was
announced a dismissal had been filed,
leaving the plaintiff open to file a new
suit. The attorneys for James Arguello
urged that the case be tried and the court
took the same view. Neither the plain
tiff nor his attorneys were present.
James Arguello and Luis Arques, who
drew the deed, testified that the deed was
a positive one and the father had said
so at the time of making it.
Judge Rhodes then ordered judgment
for James Arguello.

FRESNO, Nov. 12.â Lawyers and liti
gants in the- Pan Joaquin "Valley were
made happy to-day by the opening for tho
first time of the northern division of the
Southern District of the United States
Court in this city. The commodious
rooms in the courthouse that were former
ly occupied by Department 3 of the
Superior Court and more recently by the
District Attorney, have been fitted up In
a suitable manner for the transaction of
Federal Court tusiness.
This morning almost all the members of
the Fresno bar were present In the new
courtroom. At 10:30 o'clock Judge Well
born too his seat, and United States
Marshal Osborne in due form declared the
United States District Court in session.
The following members of the bar were
admitted to practice in the District Court
on motion and presentation of Supreme
Court certificates: George W. Jones, F.
E. Cook, II. M. Johnson. Alva E. Snow
an . J. P. Strother. There were no ex parte
matters for hearing and the District Court
was declared closed and the United States
Circuit Court declared oponed.
On motion and presentation of Supreme
Court certificates Messrs. N. H. Peterson,
George W. Jones, F. E. Cook. Edgar S.

WHEATLAND, Nov. 12.â Bray's saloon
was entered by burglars last night. After
tapping the till and cash register and ob
taining only $3, the thieves rolled the safe,
a small one, out through the back door,
loaded it into a handcart and wheeled It
out into Adams' field, where they intend
ed to open it.
Night Oflicer David Uhler heard the
noise and started to investigate. He came
upon the men a quarter of a mile north of
town. One of them ordered him to hold
up his hands. Uhler resisted and the
thieves fired upon him. One bullet pene
trated his left shoulder, ranging upward
and lodging in the muscles of his back,
and anotl\er entered the back of his left
hand and lodged in the muscles of his
forearm. Hts revolver was taken from
him and he was clubbed into insensibility
with a wagon ppoke.
"When the attack commenced the officer
yelled lustily, and fearing the neighbor
hood would be aroused the trio rled, leav
ing their complete outfit of tools and the
safe, which contained about $120. Uhler
eventually recovered consciousness and
made his way to town. Officers began a
search for the burglars, but so far it has
proved unsuccessful. Unless complications
arise L'hler's wounds will not prove fatal.

SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 12.â Fire was
discovered in the lumber yard of the
Brookings Company on the San Bernar
dino Mountains early this morning. It
is supposed It caught from the mill. In
a' short time the entire yard was in flames,
with from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 feet of sawed
lumber burning. The flames were kept
from the mill only by the heroic efforts of
the 200 men who .work there. Although
the building was on fire several times the
blaze was finally controlled and the mill
saved. â¢
The mill Is the largest In Southern Cali
fornia, and was purchased two years ago
by Brookings Bros, of Mlchlgan,*who are
running it to its full capacity, employing
200 men. It was erected ten years ago,
but ran only one season and then re
mained closed until the Brookings Bros,
took it. Adjoining the mill is Fredalba
Park, one of the best summer resorts on
the range, situated eighteen miles from
this city, Â»where there are about 200 cot
tages. From the city the flames were
seen springing high into the air, and fears
were expressed that the mill. and a por
tion of the cottages would go with the
lumber, but it is believed the cottages
are now safe. The only further damage
will be the burning of the forest beyond
and about the mill. The flames are sweep
ing up the canyon, which is covered by
heavy timber.
The scene of the fire Is near the top of
the San Bernardino range of mountains
several thousand feet above sea level and
this city.

FIBE'S RAVAGE
IN A MOUNTAIN
LUMBER YARD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Nov. 12.â In s the discov
ery of three unmarked graves on the
brush-covered hillside near the Chinese
shrimp fishing camp at Point San Pedro
several days ago Huntsman Isaac Smith
appears to have stumbled upon a cem
etery of some dimensions. As the result
of Coroner Eden's investigations to-day
the bodies of six Chinese now occupy
slabs in the local Morgue. Whether they
are victims of highbinder feuds or died
from natural causes can only be con
jectured now, but the county officials are
determined to pursue their Inquiry unt'l
the true facts are learned.
Coroner Eden and his assistants jour
neyed to the scene of Smith's discovery
this morning. The nearest approach that
could be made to the spot by the vehicles
was at the top of a long, steep hill. Leav
ing the wagons here the party proceeded
down the hill and . entered the brush,
where the graves were soon found and
opened.
The first body discovered was in a crude
redwood box, covered by several inches
of earth. It was evidently that of a mid
dle-aged Chinaman. The skull showed no
marks of violence. The next body un
covered was about ten feet further west,
in a thicket. The ground had been packed
level and there was no mark to indicate
the existence of a grave except that the
soil was thinly sprinkled with grow
ing grass. This body has been buried
some months and there was no clothing
upon It. The next grave gave up the
remains of a Chinese who ha-i been
buried about a month.
Coroner Eden and party now proceeded
Into the thick brush, where three more
bodies were rapidly brought to light.
Everything indicated that the graves were
intentionally concealed. The ground had
been leveled and pulverized so that when
the grass grew the graves would be hid
den beyond detection. At the edge of the
brush near the top of the hill a small
box was uncovered, which contained tho
body of a Chinese baby. It was dressed
richly In many colored silks and near its
head was a small fancy silk cap. All of
the corpses were placed in boxes, whicn
were shouldered and carried up and over
the steep hill to the Morgue wagon.
"When the Coroner's party began work
a number of Chinamen ran through the
village below and sounded an alarm. The
result was a rapid scattering of Mongols.
Two Chinese in particular seemed most
anxious to get away. Dressing as they
went they fairly flew around the bluffs
and finally disappeared in the largest
fishing camp, where for the time being
they will be lost. Going into the camp
later the Coroner found It Impossible to
discover a man who wÂ«uld talk English.
"No sabbc" was all they would say. The
camp, usually populous, was deserted and
only a few sullen Chinese remained to
meet the officers, to whom they refused
to talk.
The strange actions of the Chinese to
day strengthens the belief that murdor
has been done. The flight of the tisher
men, the hidden graves and the refusal
of the Chinese to explain matters have
aroused the officers and a full Investiga
tion will be made. To-morrow the bodies
will be examined. Only injuries to the
bones could be detected, as the flesh has
disappeared. Several of the bodies weri
found Jammed Into rough board boxes.
An Inquest will be held in a few days and
if necessary all the Chinese near the spot
will be summoned by the Coroner.
Remains Recovered From Unmarked
Graves in Brush May Be Those
of Victims of Highbinder
Feuds.

How often these significant words are spoken in our greet
mills, shops, and factories by the poor girl who haa worked
herself to the point where nature can endure no inoro and

you must leave, for we must put some one in your place."
Standing all day, week in and week out, or oitting in

"To shift the note teller to the paying teller's win
dow, the paying teller to that of the exchange clerk,
and so on along the line, would be to paralyze ths
business of a bank every time it happened. It would
take a man until the next shift to familiarize himself
with his work and become acquainted with what the
The New York Post objects to Mr. Sage's scheme
on the ground that it would be impracticable. It
says :
"When I read in the newspapers, first about
Schreiber and then about Alvord, I am very much^im
pressed with the fact that it is an unwise policy to let
a man handling great sums of money stay too long
in one position. In the first place he gets into a rut
and is not likely to do the best kind of work. In the
secondplacc, being left undisturbed, say for some years,
he becomes so thoroughly familiar with the books
and affairs generally under his control that he is able
to see easily where he might appropriate money tem
porarily â for none of them ever starts out v with the
intention of keeping it forever. Should he be weak
morally, or speculatively inclined, the temptation may
be too strong for him and he yields, because he be
lieves-that he may be able to hide his peculations.''
Russell Sage, in a letter to the New York Times
on the subject, suggests the advisability of shifting
bank clerks from one position t to another so fre-
Quently that none of them would have an opportunity
to practice fraud to any great extent. He says:
Schreiber was a subordinate clerk, getting only $900
a year, yet he had no difficulty in getting thousands
of dollars from the bank for the purpose of splurging
in the New York tenderloin. Alvord was a note
teller, with a salary which has been variously re
ported at from $3500 to $5000 a year, and he would
have got away with a million had not his frauds been
discovered accidentally.
SAFEGUARDS FOR BANKS.
SCHREIBER'S success in getting $106,000 out
of the bank in Elizabethport in which he was em
ployed as a clerk, followed by Alvord's achieve
ment in robbing the First National Bank of Ne'w
York of about $700,000, has set the people of the East
devising ways and means for preventing such frauds
in the future. At present our banks are fairly secure
against outside robbers of all kinds, from forgers to
burglars; but they are evidently exposed in a danger
ous degree to rascals within. Their employes of very
nearly every kind, from, president down, appear able
to take money whenever they choose, and as much
as they choose, and to keep up the fraud for years at
a time.
JAPAN AND HER INDUSTRIES.
-; The remark about "helping other nations" through
free trade is cunningly put. Doubtless Count Okuma
would like the United States to engage in the same
beneficial work, but until we are willing to see. the
American workingman competing with the Japanese
at Japanese wages we will prefer the protective sys
tem. Japan's progress so far from alluring us to free
trade warns us against it.
"Japan is not likely to adopt a protective policy in
spite of her having secured something like tariff
autonomy by her revised treaties with, the Western
nations, and in spite of the opinions of those who wish
to take advantage of the terms of those treaties. Sha
is aware that for the development of her resources
she is indebted to the free-trade system, and she will
remain a willing instrument for benefiting other na
tions through it as well as herself.". '
As further illustrations of the ability of the Japa-%
nese to meet all. comers in free competition, the Count
gives a , series of tables showing that since 1868 the
exports of Japan have advanced from less than $16,
000,000 to more than $166,000,000, and during the
same time the imports have increased from $26,000,000
to $443,000,000. In conclusion he says:
As an illustration of the success -of Japan in com
peting with Europe and the United States In manu
factures he cites the facts that Japanese matches are
exported not only to China but to the British islands
and elsewhere; that cotton spinning has so developed
that, while twenty years ago there were only 20,000
spindles in the.kingdom, there are now 1,300,000, and
Japanese spinners, besides providing the domesti
need, export cotton yarn to China, and that a show
ing almost equally good is made in the production
of paper, cement, woolen goods, silk, brushes and
soap. Moreover, in nearly all lines of industry the
people are going ahead in manufacturing not only
their own raw material but the cotton and wool
brought from other lands.
That view of the question is combated by Count
Okuma, formerly Prime Minister of Japan, in an
article in the "North American Review on "The In
dustrial Revolution of Japan." The Count points
out that at the time the new order hi things began in
Japan in 1868, "most Japanese were in utter igno
rance of the complicated theories of free trade arid
protection, so that the pros and cons of both sys
tems had never been discussed among them. Japan
thus adopted a free trade policy neither voluntarily
nor knowingly, but at the pleasure of the foreign
powers." He goes* on to cite the benefits that have
resulted from such trade, and to show that with the
cheap labor that prevails among them the. Japanese
need fear no competitors from the outside.
SINCE the United States and the various nations
of Europe consented to a revision of the oil
treaties with Japan and placed that countfy
upon an equal footing with other powers there has
been a movement among the Japanese' in favor of
establishing a system of protection as well as the gold
standard for the promotion of their industries. The
supporters of the movement argue that since the
Japanese have profited so much by following the
United States and Europe in matters of finance they
will find an equal benefit from adopting~their tariff
policiesi

THE ALABAMA CLAIMSâ T. F., .City.
The aggregate of what is known as the
Alabama claims against Great Britain
was about fiS.OOO.OCO. These were referred
to a joint high commission, which on the
14th of September, 1S72, decided that Great
Britain was responsible for the original
fitting out and subsequent escape of the
Alabama and her subsequent free admis
sion into British, ports; was similarly lia
ble in the case of the Florida; was liable
for captures made by the Shenandoah
after she was permitted to leave Mel
bourne, but was not responsible for the
acts of the Georgia, Sumter. Nashville,
Tallahassee. Chickaxnauga and Retribu
tion. The claim for indirect damages to
American commerce was not allowed. The
commission decided that Great Britain,
should pay the UnltedjStates In compen
pfttion for demage done by the vessels
named the sum of Â£3,229,166 13s 4d ($15 -
500,000). The payment to the United States
was made September 9, 1873.

Mr. Brown also points out that these protecting
forest belts in Kansas not only add to the present
wealth of the State, but are storing resources for the
future. Having visited California last summer and
observed the awful destruction of our forests by fire,
he says that their total extinction may be expected
within fifty years, and that if Kansas continues build
ing; forests by planting while we continue their "de
struction by fire, within feventy-f.^e years from now
Kansas will have to supply California with timber
and lumber. We do not regard the prophecy as at
all fantastic or improbable. Mr. Brown impeaches
the Government reports of the forest area yet in ex
istence. He declares that these reports exaggerate the
acreage of timber and tend to lull Osngress and State
governments to a feeling of false security, which will
cost this country dearly in the future. His advice
to planters is to cease planting cottonwood and box
elder, "which require too much moisture and are not
very useful as timber or lumber, and instead to plant
the catalpa speciosa. black walnut, black locust, elm
and osage orange and the mulberry, because that tree
is friendly to bird life, and birds arc the best friends
Natural fertility of the foil, where crops can be pro
duced without using artificial irrigation, is always as
sociated with forests or with other natural conserva
tors of moisture, such ?.s sloughs, ponds, swamps and
lakes. These and forests store moisture for evapora
tion, and not only mitigate the desiccating effect of
f*.ry and hot winds, but also supply moisture for dis
tribution to the surface of the earth by the clouds.
We have no doubt that three timher belts across the
Sacramento Valley, from the coast range to the foot
hills of the Sierra?, would rob our hot north winds of
their destructive power, increase the moisture of the
soil and add immensely to the productive capacity of
the whole valley.
Mr. John P. Brown, secretary of the Forestry As
sociation of Indiana, has for years closely observed
conditions in Kansas and Nebraska, and has con
cluded that both States can well afford to give up one
quarter of their surface to artificial forests, because
the fertility of what remains would far exceed .vhat
the whole would produce if the entire surface were
left treeless.
We have no doubt of the correctness of this
conclusion.
Recently an important discovery has been made that
develops the relation of forests to agriculture in that
region. Beginning thirty years ago there was an ex
tensive planting of trees on the prairies and plains of
Kansas and Nebraska. These groves are now large
and thrifty. The trees have grown to be forty feet
?.nd more in height. Their mass deflects and breaks
the hot wind, while their dense foliage affects it favor
ably by parting with moisture to the lowering of its
temperature.
Crops in a thrifty condition have been often killed
by that sirocco. Green fields of corn and small grain
are fired by it as if they had been baked in an oven.
TREES AND AGRICULTURE.
KANSAS and Nebraska have as a drawback to
agriculture a blasting hot wind that blows from
the southwest. ' *
We have already directed attention to the experi
ments made by Marconi in England, by which he
proved the capability of his system to preserve the
secrecy of dispatches, and to send various messages
along parallel Hoes or across one another without con
fusing the receiver, and also his ability to operate the
system without the use of high masts. Those tests
justify the expectation that the system will be available
for all purposes for which telegraphy is used. Con
sequently the early years of the coming century may
see the end of all telegraphing by wire. Cities will
be rid of that much of the overhead wire nuisance,
and in many other ways benefits will be reaped from
the splendid invention of Marconi.
That practical illustration of what can be accom
plished by wireless telegraphy in its present state of
development shows the vast use that may be made of
it. When a ship fifty miles distant from the coast can
sen'd to land a notification of her approach and fix
almost to a minute the time of her arrival, it is clear
that we have it our power to get rid of much of the
difficulty that attends navigation at the entrance to
harbors. Should all ships make use of the system
notice could be sent ahead in every case to pilots and
others interested in the approaching ship, so that
every, preparation might be made for receiving her.
A DISPATCH from London to the New York
Herald of recent date says:

entine, while nearing Dover pier on Saturday, "ex

It is to be hoped that our "commercial bodies will at
once take the matter in hand and command the atten
tion of Congress.
This subject is of peculiar and pressing interest to
this coast. The trade of the Pacific ft soon to excel
all dreams. It is our trade. It should be carried under
our flag. Our shipyards should be multiplied, and
here should be the finest opportunity for marine ar
chitects and mechanics, and as the fleets are launched
here should American sea-going enterprise find its
most profitable employment.
Our land transportation is the best in the world,*
and its creation was, in the beginning, fostered by the
Government. Our water transportation must have
the same attention.
In many respects wa are the most fortunate of the
nations in being at the beginning of the creation of a
merchant marine. We have no obsolete methods to
discard at the cost of their abandonment. All of the
newest findings of science and art in the building and
propelling of ships are at our service. Other nations
that are equipped with a merchant marine up to their
capacity for its profitable use, to avail themselves of
the best must lose what they have. Our tonnage is so
small compared with our capacity to use its facilities
that the obsoleting process will work us.no injury-
With these two measure? promptly accomplished
it may be truthfully said that it will only have begun
the utilization of the vast resources of our continent,
and the vast energies of our people.
The immediate revival of our merchant marine goes
hand in hand with the construction of an isthmian
canal. We want the canal and we want American
ships of the first class to carry commerce by that
short route around the world.
In our brief Spanish war was furnished in miniature
what happens in war to trade under the flag of a
belligerent. 'Alien cargoes under the Spanish flag
were captured on the high seas, and had Spain been
in control of as much of the world's carrying trade as
Great Britain a deadening paralysis would have fallen
upon the world's commerce. We cannot afford to
longer give away the profits of deep-water transporta
tion, nor to longer incur the risk of losing all our
foreign trade by having it carried under an alien flag,
that may at any time be involved in war with a com
bination powerful enough to make the risk of shipping
under it greater than the profit.
These statistics bring into focus the imperative ne
cessity of protecting our increasing foreign trade by
ownership of the facilities for its transportation.
Primarily it is a question of profit it is
one of continued existence.
Any blow that strikes the commercial flag of Great
Britain hits our trade by cutting off or crippling the
means of carrying it t.o.our customers." Our trade has
expanded in other grand divisions of the world more
rapidly than in Europe. In breadstuff's the increase
in our export to the continent of Europe in the
year ending last June was 10 per tent, while the in
crease to Oceanica was 48 per cent, to Asia 43 per
cent.
The?e figures mean that most of the world's carry
ing trade is done in British bottoms, and that our ex
ternal commerce, of more than two and a quarter bil
lions, has to rely upon England for transportation
and is carried under the British flag. -The ships are
built of British material, in British shipyards, by
British workmen. All of the profits of construction,
insurance and equipment, the wages of sailors and
officers, paid by us in freight charges go abroad in
stead of being kept at home.
..British colonies, which is half as much as ours, her
total is 13,665,312 tons and exceeds ours by 11,216,635
tons.
Lloyd's Register for 1808-99 gives to the United
States a ship tonnage, including wood, iron and steel
construction, steam and sail, of 2,448,677 tons. Great
Britain has 12,567,904 tons. Germany has 2,113,981
tons. France has 1,179,515 tons. Norway has 1,643,
217 tons. The total tonnage of the world is 26,561,250
tons. We rank second, but Great Britain leads us by
10,000,000 tons, and, adding to her tonnage that of the
It will be seen that our total foreign trade reached
the vast volume of $2,343,901,041.

l~\ the year ending the 30th of last June brings for
* ward at once the conditions under which that
vast commerce is handled on deep water.
* For that year our total imports were $849,714,670,

OUR CARRYING TRADE.
A German paper says that the renoml
nation of Adlai Stevenson for the posi
tion of Vice President is another illus
tration of the fact that boys of the most
humble parentage have an opportunity of
rising to the highest positions in America.
Thus Abraham Lincoln was a rail split
ter, and "Old Abe's ax" was a rallying,
cry in Mis campaigns. Herr Stevenson,
also, it seems, early learned to use the
ax, and. even after ho had risen to a high
position In the Postofflce Department he
did not scorn to get 6ut his ax on occa
sion and do a little work around the de
partment with It. This evidence of indus
try and lack of false pride on his part
have greatly endeared him to a large
class of voters. Like so many great
statesmen. ltÂ» has been given a pet or
nickname by hla friers. Thus as Oliver
Cromwell was by the English "Old Iron
sides" called, so Herr Stevenson is by his
compatriots "Old Mossyback" nicknamed.
In a paper published in the south of
France is found an even more ampins
account of the early life and explplw of
Colonel Bryan. This story. It appears
was written by the Paris correspondent of
the provincial paper, and Is based, so th *
writer avers, on Information furnished by
Intimate friends of the candidate vvho
have been prominent at the French capi
tal during the exposition. r r ~r,^Yt
The Western wag who filled the French
man so full of new and startling Informa
tion must have smiled to himself as he
read in cold print the statement that AL
le Colonel Bryan first came Into fame as
one of the strange, half-savage band of
cowboys"-gardeur de vaches. it appears
in the orlginal-"who roamed over the
Far West, fighting the Indians and -wild
beasts. Imitating, perhaps, the custom
of the Indian chiefs, each of these cow
boys bore a nickname based pn some of
his exploits as a hunter or fighter. Thus
M. le Colonel Bryan's familiar title among
his rough but brave and 8 iJ? rdy .g? mr , a Â±%
was Silver Bill, the Dead Shotâ 'Bill d Ar
gent.' After the treaty of peace was
signed with the Indians at Chicago in
1896 Colonel Bryan went out of the cat
tle business and became one or the do
nanza farmers of the West. He can now
sit on his back stoop, as the rear ve
randa Is called In America, and look
over his fields of waving corn stretching
farther than the eye" can reach in every
direction. As a result of his early train
ing on the plains, when he spent months
at a time without an opportunity of talk
ing to another human being, the candi
date for President Is extremely taciturn
and can hardly be persuaded to express
his opinion on the issues of the campaign.
He is the author of a book of adventure
called 'The First Battle,' in which some
of his encounters with the Indians- of the
Tammany and other tribes are described
at length. In the effort to partially neu
tralize the strength of M. le Colonel
amorig the cowboys and Indians, who
make up the largest part of the voting
population west of the Alleghany Moun
tains, the Republicans have nominated M.
le Colonel Roosevelt for Vice President
M. le Colonel Roosevelt is orie of the lead
ing amateur cowboys In America, and 13
especially famous for having once van
quished a grizzly bear In single combat.
During the present campaign SI. le Colo
nel Roosevelt has ridden a series of horses
all over the country giving exhibitions
of rough riding such as were seen in Paris
a year or more ago under the direction of
another famous American statesman."
dounds considerably to his. credit that he
never became a colonel, differing in that
respect from -the vast majority of tne
American citizens." ' This JÂ° k Â« n d ls - Â°f

plete chart and explanation but the inci
dent in the political -meeting is told in
most serious and deadly earnest.
Quaint Clippings From Foreign Journals on
the Standard Bearers and Their
President McKinley Is a giant of physi
cal strength. When roughs attempt to
interrupt his' speeches he leaves the plat
form and knocks the heads of the in
truders together until their teeth rattle.
Mr. Bryan Is a reformed cowboy, and
was oi'ce known as "Silver Bill, the Dead
Shot cf the Platte." At present he is a
bonanza farmer. <
These are a few of the many new facts
about tho Presidential candidates printed
in recent Issues of foreign newspapers and
periodicals. Almost every recent issue of
each German, French* or English paper
has contained an article on the "Ameri
can election," and most of these articles
have iairly bristled with pew and start
ling facts about the candidates and the
Issues. There can be no doubt that even
Mr. McKinley and Mr. Bryan would be
greatly surprised if they could read some
of the things the foreign journalists have
found out about them. Take, for instance,
the entertaining tale printed In the Lon-
Illustrated Mall setting forth the
prowess of President McKinley as an am
ateur Sandow and explaining how he Is
in the habit of treating people who ven
ture to Interrupt him when he is making
a Bpeech.
McKinley has always been noted, ac
cording to the Mail, for his huge muscu
lar development. His biceps . measure
enough Inches to frighten a prizefighter,
and he refuses even to wink his eye In
order to avoid trouble. In fact, as the
j^ondon journalist has discovered, he car
ries a chin around on his shoulder and is
fairly aching to have some one knock it
orf.
On one occasion, says the Englishman,
Mr. McKinley was taking part in an elec
tioneering campaign in one of the East
ern States where there was fierce and
bitter opposition â¢ to the candidate whom
he was supporting. At one of his meet
ings a crowd of semi-civilized young men
frcm one of the outlying districts came
into the hall and started to create a dis
turbance by playing on their tomtoms
and giving three cheers for the rival can
didate. After waving his hands for si
lence In vain, Mr. McKinley took off his
coat and fought his way to the center of
the room, where "sat the ringleaders. They
were two giants In stature, but McKinley
seized them one in each hand and beat
their heads together until their teeth rat
tled and they begged plteously for mercy.
A third man of equal size and strength,
who attempted to escape after giving his
war whoop, was pursued and captured by
Mr. McKinley, who, seizing him by the
hair, dragged him back through the hall
to the platform. In spite of his tremen
dous struggles and shrieks for mercy.
On reaching the platform Mr. McKinley
doubled hie weeping captlvt up like a
jackknife and deposited him on the seat
of an arm chair, immediately sitting
down upon him. Then, the Mail Informs
ub, Mr. McKinley put on an innocent and
unruffled expression and addressed the au
dience as if nothing had Happened.
"If any other gentleman desires to be
pat upon," he is alleged to have said, "he
c.in be easily accommodated. Tnere are
plenty of chairs up here on the platform
anG several of the committee weigh over
200 pounds each. Pray walk up."
Thereafter it is related that President
McKinley never had any trouble in keep
ing his audiences in order. After perpe
trating this weird tale, which fortunately
comes too late to be used by the Demo
crats as an example of the methods em
ployed by the Republicans inÂ« suppressing
free speech, the Mall concludes with a
jckc. It reviews Major McKinley's mili
tary career and declares that "it re-

It has been said of old, "in a multitude of counsel
there is wisdom"; and so, out of the discussion now
going on, the bankers may arrive at a plan for safe
guarding their money from their trusted employes.
In the meantime it is to be noted that some of the
New York bankers have begun to investigate the
habits of their clerks, and a recent report says the
German Savings Bank has just discharged three
clerks who were found to be making bets on race
courses. Perhaps that plan may produce good re
sults, but the world will not forget that some fraudu
lent bank clerks and cashiers have been more con
spicuous at church than at race tracks. Evidently an
audit board would be safer than a v spy system on the
clerks after banking hours.
The Post suggests that bank directors make
themserve.s acquainted with the habits of their trusted
clerks, that adequate salaries be paid; honest and
capable men, and that there be created and main
tained an audit bureau within the bank itself, to main
tain a constant and critical investigation of 'every de

After hearing Jones' petition Judge
Coffey denied the same on various
grounds. % and then Charles Goodman
opened his case. It developed during the
examination that Charles Goodman was
a Jockey and a resident of Kings County.

bookkeeping, but simply a lesson. There
are hundreds of people who have to do
with accotinta who have very vague no
tions as to what Is meant by double en
try, and there are hundreds of others who
can make correct "double entries" for or
dinary "straight" transactions, but who
fail to comprehend the entries when the
transaction is mixed or' unusual. This les
son and one or two more difficult lessons
which will follow are intended specially
for these classes of office workers. It is
much more Important to learn the princi
ples which govern correct systems of
bookkeeping than it is to learn any par
ticular form as applied to a special busi
ness. It is safe to say that no two houses
keep their books In the same way, and the
larger the houses the more widely do their
forms of bookkeeping differ. Each con
cern adapts the- books to its own special
needs; but the theory of accounts, the un
derlying principles of double entry, are
the same the world over. The beginner
in the accounting department of a large
concern who knows the principles thor
oughly, but who has had no practical
experience, is ten times more fortunate
than is the beginner who has learned now
to keep the books of a particular con
cern but who beyond that knows little if
anything of the principles of double en
try.
The ledger is a book in which accounts
are kept. Each account has two sidesâ a
charge Bide and a credit side. When a
man buys something and doesn't pay for
it at once we -charge himâ that is, we
make an entry of the amount on the
charge side of his account. When he pays
the whole or part of his bill we credit
him-that Is. we' make an entry of the
amount on the credit sfde of his account.
The charges are called debits, so that an
account consists of a list of debits on the
one side and a list of credits on the other
side. The debits are entered on the left
hand side and the credits on the right
hand side.
We must remember, however, that the
ledger may consist of several books â that
is to say, the charge entry may be made
in one book and the credit entry in an
other. The principle of double entry lies
in the fact that every charge or debit has
a corresponding credit, and the debits and
credits always balance.
We shall begin with a series of very
simple transactions and follow along step
by step until we reach transactions pre
senting a variety of complications.
Transactions.
1. Homer Carter Invests 5953 50 in busi
ness. â¢

Noteâ Debit the goods account with $238 71
and credit King with the same amount, then
credit the cash account with $173 and charge
King with $175. This makes a complete record
of the transaction*. It is really two transac
tionsâfirst, goods bought on credit, cash paid
on account.
9. Sold goods valued at $235 60 to Samuel
Harding: received in payment cash $100;

XI. HOW TO DO SIMPLE EQUA
TIONS.
The questions offered In this lesson arÂ«
slightly more difficult than those pub
lished on October 15. If the student will
remember to follow the order here out
lined he will have little if any dlfflcut'.y
in solving the exercises:
1. Remove all brackets, changing: thÂ©
signs where necessary. When a minus
sign precedes an expression Inclosed In.
brackets, as, (3xâ 4) or â5 <x-f21). tho
signs within the brackets are changed
when the brackets are removed, as
â 3x + 4 and âox â 105.
2. Carry all the unknown quantitiesâ
that Is. all the term3 having x as one of
the factorsâ to the left-hand side, remem
bering to change the sign of each term
transferred, and carry all the known
quantities to the right-hand side, remem
bering also to change the sign of each
number transferred.
3. Simplify each side of the equation by
addition and subtraction. Remember that
you can change ' all ttie signs of an
equation without changing the truth of
the equation.
Illustrative Exercise.
Sxâ 2 (9â4x1+3 (5Xâ 7>=10xâ Â« a+fcO+Sl.
Remove brackets and we have:
6x-19-r8x+15x-21=10x_4-24x+51.
Bring unknown numbers to the left and
known numbers to tha right.
6x+Sx+15xâ 10x+24x=lS+21â 4+51
Collect by addition and subtraction.
43x =S6
x = 2
Exercises for Practice.
Solve the following equations:
1. 6(5xâ 3) â 14(9â x>=105x+133<x â 4)
2. (x+3) (x+4>â Â£=(x+l) (x+2)
3. (x+4) (x+4)-(x-3) (x+3>=57
4. <x-7) <x+3)-(x-4) (x+21)=0
5. 2xâ 36=3x(xâ 4>â x(3xâ 8)
B. x(xâ 3)+x(x+6)=(x+5> (2x+3V- 2Â«x
Problems which lead to equations con
sist of verbal statements of relations be
tween certain quantities, some of which
are unknown. It will be found that there
are always as many relations as there arÂ«Â»
' unknown quantities. If each relation Is
expressed in algebraical language, the un
known quantities being denoted by let
ters, an equation will be obtained. Thus
every problem leads to as many equations
as there are unknown quantities Involved.
-The solution of a problem consists In
the equations which express the>
Rations stated and then in solving the
Sedation? so obtained.
Illustrative Exercise.
Kind a number which when multiplied
by 5 exceeds 30 by as much as SO exceeds
the number.
Let x denote the number. Then 5x ex
ceeds 30 by an much as 30 exceeds x;
that is, 5xâ 30 is equal to 30â x.
5xâ 30=30â x
5x+x=30+30
6x = 60
X = 10
Thus 10 Is the required number.
Exercises for Practice.
7. Find three consecutive numbers whosa
sum is 135.
8. The sum of two num.bers Is 14 and 4
times the greater equals 8 times the less.
Find the numbers.
9. At an election 4669 votes were re
corded for two candidates. The successful
candidate had a majority of 283. What

The bellboys explored the tray and what
was left on It, even going so far as to
dive beneath the lumps of sugar and un
cover the empty teapot. But all in vain.
"Somebody has ctolen it if it isn't on the
tray." insisted the famous opera singer
but the words had hardly ceased to echo
through the corridor when a shrill "Oh, I
have found It" rang from Melba's apart
ments, and the bellboys heaved sigi-s of
relief.
"I am sure I left It on that tray," she
cried in a voice that brought everybody
in that part of the building to the scene.
Mme. Melba bad all the bellboys on the
fourth floor of the Palace on the qul vlve
oarly last evening. She had partaken of a
dainty lunch in her room, and the tray
had hardly been lodged In a corner of the
hall outside when the diva raced wildly
from her boudoir and declared to the be
wildered bellboys that her gold purse had
been stolen.
Melba and Her Gold Purse.
The management of the Grand Opera
house was highly, pleased with the way
In which the police handled this vexing
.problem. Last year the rain fell in tor
rents on the opening night of the grand
opera season, and although Sergeant Gor
man had arranged an excellent plan it did
not work as harmoniously as last night.
When the curtain fell on the n"nal act
of the opera the 'Ulrst nighters" poured
out of the lobby In great numbers. As
fast as they appeared Sergeant Gorman
and Corporal Bowlin ushered them to
carriages, irrespective of those they came
in. This was part of the plan agreed to
by the hack inspectors, and met with the
hearty approbation of the owners of the
vehicles. The pleasure seekers were driven
to their homes, and the jehus had their
orders to simply take their names and re
port to their employes the following morn
ing.
The carriages from the stables of the
United Carriage Company, Mlchaelson,
Kell & Son nnd Tompkins came down
Third street and east of the Grand Opera
house. . The carringes sent out by Conlon.
Nolan, Hoppe, Harris. Corbett and the
Pacific Carriage Company came inxfrom
the direction of Fourth street. The car
riages from the east drew up in front of
the theater and to the east of the en
trance, and the vehicles that came from
the direction of Third street dropped their
occupants to the west of the entrance. In
departing the drivers headed their horses
on a direct line, so that there was no
turning nor confusion.
Sergeant Gorman laid his plans for the
opera season before the tickets were on
sale. He had been instructed by his supe
riors to see to it that the grand opera
patrons were neither inconvenienced* nor
delayed in going to and from the opera
house, and he obeyed his instructions to
the letter.
At no time during the performance was
there" any danger of a panic in the
crowded house. On each floor of the thea
ter three policemen were stationed, and
their orders were not to leave their posts.
Doors that led to exits were kept in readi
ness to be thrown open by the watchful
policemen. Detectives in citizens' clothes
mingled with the audience and kept watch
for suspicious characters who might be
tempted to despoil the ladies of their
costly jewels. â¢
Captain Spillane will have his squad in
attendance at every performance and in
tends taking every precaution to prevent
accident or annoyance to the opera-goers.
As early as 7 o'clock carriages began
rolling up to the door. As fast as they
arrived Sergeant Gorman and Corporal
F. H. Bowlin opened the doors, and as
soon as the vehicles were emptied of their
human freight they were dismissed. The
prearranged system, of handling the car
riages worked to perfection. There was
not a delay nor a hitch during the entire
evening. ?

opera company. Even Chief of Police Sul

his meed of praise.

NT7W TORK. Nov. 12â The first decisive.set
back to the upward course of prices which has
bt*Ki in full swing in the stock market since
Wednesday morning Â¦ last occurred to-day and
conservative circles In Wall street breathe
easier as a consequence. The headlong paxe
at which the epeculatlon has proceeded haj
been the cause of uneasiness lest some un
toward event should precipitate a violent de
cline Trlth disastrous results. To-day's late
reaction was largely due to manipulation by
professional bears and there were indications
that eome of the large bull Interests were ac
quiescent In the movement. A prolonged and
extensive advtmce, such as that of the last
â¢week, attracts a following of weak specula
tors, whose liability to fright force liquida
tion en a very slight reaction and are a menace
and an obstruction to the more powerful bull
epeculators. This latter class sometimes wink
c.t a bear attack in order to Ehake oft thU
undesirable following. There was an enor
mous amount of profit-taking accomplished
during the tarty hours of the day by profes
sional speculators, who began to feel doubts
over the continuance of the heavy buying de
mand for stocks. Interests which had thus
told out were willing to see lower prices in '
orfier to buy back stocks. It looked at one '
time, however, as though the abtorpUve power
of the market was sufficient to carry througu
this realizing; and lift prices to a higher level,
Â¦a wes the case many times during last week's
rampant bull market- High prices for the day,
in fact, were made by a large number of stocka
after the early reaction and the speculation
had shifted into the standard railroad etociu.
co aa to give a healthier tone to the market
than during the morning, when the widest
movements were In the mercurial specialties.
ThÂ« stiffening of the call money rate *-as tba
most effective factor in inducing the ate re
action. Skillful speculators have kept a watch
ful eye on this index of money conditions to
detect the first Fipnal of danger that the bor
rowings for speculative purposes were ovtr
runslng the available resources of the money
market. Saturday's barjc statement was to
confusing and so far removed from prelimin
ary estimates that Us unfavorable features
â¢were ignored this morning, the more so as
money continued to be offered at 4 per cent.
It is not likely that there was any actual
pressure upon speculative borrowers to-day, but
the effect upon speculative Interest of th'r rise
in the money rate to 5 per cent was conclusive.
The sensitiveness of opinion to this indication
and the success of the professional attack upon
the market after the many failures of last
week warrant the supposition that the eager
rush to buy stocks has at last begun to show
signs of Fatiety. The elgns were not clear
this morning when orders to buy came, into
the market in seemingly undiminished volume,
hut by noonday the activity had sensibly
fallen off and the later recovery in prices had
a somewhat artificial appearance, the rise
shifting from one stock to another, giving the
market a epotty appearance and leaving the
point* of strength somewhat 'solated. Penn
sylvania, which has been reactionary for sev
eral days past, was the leader of the recovery
at en extreme advance of 2Â»i points. But it
had a large following among other substantial
railroad stocks, which roee from 1 to Us points.
The earlier advance In the steel stocks hai

from 2 to 2'4 in the leading industrials an-J

Humors have boen current during the day of
hostile intentions between the Steel and Wire
and Federal Steel companies and these stocks
ruCered most severely in the late break. Fe.J

The selling on reaction was precipitate, but
not in aa large volume as the buying on the
advance. Many of the industrial stocks sut

Tn the railroads the losses from the best ran
between 1-4 In the principal stocks and lit

CHICAGO, Nov. 12.â During the fore part of
the session wheat felt the effect of the world's
shipments, which were 9.000,000 bushels, com
pared with 8,400, COO bushels last week. De
cember opened '4c lower to unchanged at 74@
74'ic and for half an hour despite pressure
from longs held steadily slightly under flrat
figures. At the end of that time, however,
the price gave way and dropped to 7JVi@73*gc.
An advance at Antwerp of SO centimes, equal
to 24c here was reported. While longs were
busy unloading this morning bears were going
j-hort and a shift of sentiment took place. The
advance was taken as confirmation of Argen
tine damage report. December began to re
cover gradually and later when lt was learne-i
that local houses were doing a liberal direct
export buslnes-6 prices advanced sharply. De
cember climbed to 74U'a74%c and closed firm
54c above Saturday at 744c.
Corn was a flrm and fairly active market.
The strength was due to the small visible de
crease and light country offerings. December
closed firm. *Â»@4e higher at 36Vi@36%c.
Oats ruled steady and flrm in tone, prices
being helped by the corn strength. December
closed He up at 22S22UC
Provisions were fairly active and strong.
The market opened higher on a light run of
hogs and higher prices at the yards. Packers
offered very little on the advance," which so
impressed shorts that the price was bid sharply
up. A strong cash demand wa> reported and
this also helped In advancing futures.' Janu
ary closed 274(8 30c over Saturday, lard 124c
higher and ribs 124iÂ§15c improved..

Arrest of Joe Lavier and Wal

Jules Nolsat, Flllmore House, Stockton
street and Broadway, swore out war
rants in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
for the arrest of Joe Lavier and Walter
Williams on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. His appearance showed
that he had been roughly dealt with.
Nolsat alleges that he called at 627
Montgomery avenue Sunday night to see
Mary Smith, a lady friend. The two de
fendants accosted him and demanded to
know his business. He resented their in
terference and a fight followed. Williams
attacked him with a knife, cutting him
on the neck and over the eye. Lavier hit
him on the head with a "black jack,"
knocking him down. They also kicked
him while he was down.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 12.â The following
order was made public at the War De
partment to-day:
By direction of the President, the Depart
ment of Porto Rico will te discontinued on De
cember 15, 1S00. and the iiOand of Porto Rico
and the islands and keys adjacent thereto will
be attached to the Department of the East and
denisncted as the Dintrlct of Porto Rico.
The colonel, lieutenant colonel, headquarters,
band and one battalion of the Kleventh In
fantry and the squadron of the Fifth Cavalry
now Fervinr in Porto Rico will be relieved
from duty therein an aoon as practicable and
sent to New York City, whence they will pro
ceed to such stations as may be designated
hereafter.
Brifradier General Geonre Davln, U. E. V.,
now In command of the Department of Porto
Rico, will upon the direnntinuance of that de
partment repair to Manila. Philippine Islands,
and report to the commanding general of the
Division of the Philippines for ascignment to
duty as inspector general of that division.
ELIHU ROOT. Secretary of War.
By command of Lieutenant General Miles.
H. C. CORBIN. Adjutant General.
This order was Issued after a full cable
consultation with Governor Allen of Por
to Rico, and after General Davis, who
lately has been In command, had made
his recommendations. It was the opinion
of Governor Allen that the reduction of
the force In Porto RJco would be eminent
ly satisfactory to the people of the Isl
and, and that the force to be retained
would be ample for all present purposes.
Thi* ordÂ«>r leaves in Porto Rico the na
tive regiment, consisting of Â£50 men. a
battalion of the Eleventh Infantry and
batteries F and G of the Fifth Artillery.
These troops will be under the command
of Lieutenant Colonel James A.-Buchan
an who is now in command of the na
tive regiment. It is quite probable that
the troops which are ordered from Porto
Rico may in time be sent to the Philip
pines.

Uncollected taxes may, when gathered

pert Williams of the Board of Supervisor
has been searching the unpaid tax records
with some startling results. Williams
finds that the Bank of British Columbia
owes taxes on personal property assessed
in 1S96 amounting to $36,165 51. While this
might have been collected at the time
now It has probably become outlawed.
Other banks are heavy debtors and Wells-

Elisha B. Worrell Confident of Abil
ity to Establish Fruit Con

To His Excellency. Henry T. Gage, Governor
of the Sta'e of California: In the issue of. the
Sacramento Bee of October 12 appeared an ar
ticle severely criticising the management of tha
Preston School of Industry. At the first meet
ing of the Board of Trustee3 held thereafter,
which was on the 13th day of October, 1900. tha
superintendent. D. S. Hlrshbers. demanded an
immediate and thorough investigation of ths
charges contained In said article.
The board began aa examination that nlfht
and completed the uma at Its next meeting,
held November 10. After a lull and complete
investigation of said charges we beg to pre
sent to you the following report:
Firstâ The statement "that Superintendent D.
S Hlrshberg is to be replaced was received
with little surprise and -little regret In lone,
on Investigation, was found to be untrue.
Secondâ The statement that "it had been the
subject of a good deal of comment, both in
town and at the school, that he had been al
lowed to remain uj> to the present time was
disproved by reliable evidence.
Thirdâ The statement that "it has been an
open secret that Hirshberg has been unable to
maintain any kind of discipline in the school;
that the majority Â«* his own subordinates do
not speak to him except when obliged to do so
in the performance of duty, and that practice*
go on under his very nose and known to him
that show a state of unprintable depravity and
degeneracy among the Inmates of the school
almoet impossible of belief Is not true.
Fourthâ The statement that 'â¢Hlrshbers has
always boasted of his pull with the administra
tion and that he is likely to nght an effort to
oust him or offer objection to the appointment
of a successor" waa disproved by reliable evl-
e Fifthâ The statement that "there are plenty
who will say that there is a condition of affairs
at the school that would warrant Its abolition.
If it cannot be remedied, but when details arÂ»
asked for they tsay that they cannot afford to
talk and some one else must bear the brunt."
was disproved by direct testimony of the officers
and employes of the school.
Sixthâ The statement that as at first con
ducted the Preston School of Industry Is a black
and filthy blot upon the map of the State; that
it is anything but a reformatory Institution;
that en the contrary It is declared to be little
else than a school of infamy and crime; that
If a boy la taken Into It with a trace of de
cency and the possibility of being made a man
the chances are 100 to 1 that through his asso
ciations all of this will soon be wiped out and
hÂ« will In the course of time be graduated
either a full-fl?>.g"l criminal of the foulest kind
or an idiot" is not only untrue, but Is an out
rajreous and llbelous statement.
Seventhâ The statement that "there are not
a few Instances of boys being treated for vlla
diseases, contracted at the school; that boyi.
etc at the schools" Is not true.
Ei'ehthâ That "one Jerry Oreen Â«u punished
bv Superintendent Hfrshber* and Captain Wood
and that in resisting the officer he had his face
Injured" Is true, and we further find that no
more force was used to punish than was abso
lutely necessary upon said Green, and we fully
exonerate Mr. Hlrahber* from the Implied
chars** of brutality.
Ninthâ The statement 'that Adams waa dis
charged because hit refused to pay a fine of J10
for letting a boy escape" !â¢ untrue.
Tenthâ The statement that Hlrshberg had a
personal row with nearly every ofneer In the
Institution and that thÂ»y all despise him. but
are afraid to talk for fear of losing' their
places," was positively denied by the several
employes and officers of the school.
Eleventhâ The statement "until recently es
capes have been common, but now the discipline
Is so lax no one wanted to gtt away." t, selÂ£ .
contradictory and therefore not true.
Twelfthâ That "there Is a certain kind of Im
morality among the larger boys when first sent
to this Institution" Is doubtless true, as this
Is an evil which Is incidental to all reforma
tory schools, and Is one of the reasons for com
mitting moral delinquents to these schools, but
the records of this Institution on that point will
compare favorably with other reformatories in
this and other States. We have succeeded In
very nearly stamping out thia special evil and
can absolutely do so aa mob aa we get our col
lege system or segregation In force.
Thirteenthâ That there "are boys committed to
thia institution who ought not to be committed"
Is no doubt true, but neither the Board of
Trustees nor the Superintendent has any con
trol over that matter, commitment under the
law being entirely In the hands of the Superior
Judges of the several counties. Tours respect
fully,

The trustees of the Preston School of

a year ago, when he brought his sister.
Mrs. Hill, to live with himself and wife.
Immediately his wife took offense and de

said she was not in the business of keep

he bought a ticket with the purpose of

everything with her and fled. The fol

wife. In which she said she had left him
for good. He has not seen her since, but
has received several threatening letters,
which were placed In evidence at the

. Meyers thinks he will be able to recog
nize the men in case they are arrested.
He says one was rather' slim, about 5 feet
6 Inches in height, and had a small mus
tache. The second was tall and heavily
built. He could not Fee his face, as It was
closely concealed by the handkerchief.
The one who remained outside was of
medium height and was dressed In a dark
suit of clothes. The three men, Meyers
says, wore Flouch hats. The handker
chiefs which the two who did the active
work used to hide their faces were found,
outside the entrance to the bar, having
been thrown away by the robbers.
"I was deeply interested in the story
that I was reading," said Meyers, when
giving his version of the robbery to De
tective "Bob" Graham, "and did not 6to
the men enter. They both wore while
masks, which completely hid their faces.
When they covered me with their revol
vers I looked kind of longingly toward
the open door, when I saw a third man.
whom I strongly suspect of being an ac
complice. His back was turned to me.
but notwithstanding I noticed that he con
tinually looked up and down the street
to see of anybody was approaching.
"After I threw up my hands the rob
bers searched my pocket.", but secured
only 5 cents, all the money I had with me.
They then bound my hands with a
handkerchief, and after choking me
forced me Into a closet which is
Just off the bar. I remained there
until they left and then I kicked open
the door. After considerable trouble I
managed to release my hands, and run
ning outside shouted for the police. Two
omeers readily responded, and after get
ting a description cf the men from me
went in search of the desperate fellows.
I did not knew that they had rifled the
cash drawer until I returned to the bar.
The drawer was on the floor, but the con
tents were gone."
Meyers was sitting on a table reading a
newspaper when the robbers entered. In
the basement of the hall were a number
of juvenile athletes, who were practicing
on horizontal bars, but they knew nothing
of the robbery until sometime after It
had happened.
Two masked men last night entered the
bar in the Mission Turn Vereln Hall, at
Eighteenth and Lapidge streets, and after
securely binding Henry Meyers, who was
in charge, robbed the cash register of
$3 60. Both men were armed with revolv
ers, which they threatened to use on
Meyers If he made an outcry. After tying
his hands with a silk handkerchief they
severely choked him and then locked him
In a closet. The police were notified im
mediately after the robbery, but up to an
early hour this morning they had not suc
ceeded in obtaining a. clew to the perpe
trators of the daring crime.

Upon cross-examination the witness de

ARTHUR ARLINGTON, TTHO
CAPTURED WIDOW WITH
IRRESISTIBLE BAIT.
OAKLAND, Nov. 12.â Though ha
has been sentenced to serve the
rest of his natural life in the
penitentiary, Arthur Arlington,
who is being held at the County
Jail pending the decision of the Supremo
Court on his appeal for a new trial, con
tinues to make women his dupes. His
latest victim is a Mrs. Baldwin, who saya
her home Is in Chicago.
Mrs. Baldwin this morning told the
story of how she had been fooled by the
wily Arlington to Jailer Georga V. Tay
lor of the County Jail, where she appeared
Reeking information about the man. She
said she had come all the way from her
home In Chicago to meet Arlington, whom
she expected to marry. She had become
acquainted by correspondence with him
through a matrimonial bureau publica
tion, into which he had put an advertise
ment which she answered.
The correspondence between them had
been kept up for more than four months.
Arlington told a glowing story of wealth
piled up by mining and stock Investments,
and sent what purported to be a likeness
of himself. He urged her to come to Cali
fornia and marry him. saying that he had
a lawsuit on his hands and could not get
away.
USES WARREN ENGLISH'S
PHOTOGRAPH AS A DECOY
When Widow Baldwin Sees It She at Once
Rushes Out Here to Meet Arlington, Whom
She Supposes to Be the Original.
Mrs. Baldwin promised to come "West as
soon as she could straighten out her af
fairs, which she had set about Immediate
ly to do. In the meantime- she had sent
the photographs of herself and two
daughters. The letters that passed be
tween the couple burned with affection,
and there was every promise of a real
love match.
True to her promise, Mrs. Baldwin left
her home in Chicago and came to Oak
land, arriving here last Wednesday. Sha
had been accustomed to address her let
ters to just Oakland, and had an idea thfit
this was a frontier town, but when Â»hÂ»
got off the train at Sixteenth-street sta
tion she concluded that It was something
of a city. To find Arlington was quite a
task, but she set about it with dispatch.
She wrote four letters from the Albany
Hotel, she said, and made numerous in
quiries. The four letters reached Arling
ton at the County Jail.
Arlington's story about a lawsuit led
Mrs. Ba.-twin to believe that her man wa*
engaged at the courthouse, and this morn-
Ing she appeared early. She inquired of
the janitor for Arlington, and was told
that, such a man was prisoner at the
County Jail. Thither she went, to learn
the story of Arlington's misdeeds and hlg
sentence for life. Then she wept ani de
manded to see Arlington, who was im
mediately brought from his apartments.
In the presence of the Jail officials the
couple met.
"How dare yon play with my affections,
sir?" demanded the defiant Mrs. Baldwin.
"Give me back my pictures and '.ettera,
and I will give you back yours."
But Arlington was equal to the occa
sion. He denied emphatically that he had
ever seen the woman or her pictures be
fore or that he "had ever corresponded
with her. But she stuck to her asser
tions and Insisted on the return of the
pictures and correspondence. The words
of the couple were becoming more heated
every moment, and finally, when a halr
pulllng match seemed Imminent. Arling
ton was taken tack to hl3 quarters.
Before she went away Mrs. Baldwin
drew from her pocketbook the picture Ar
lington had sent her. It was a. half-tone
likeness of ex-Congressman Warren B.
English. The discovery of this further
deception Increases Mrs. Baldwin's rage.
and she swore to have vengeance upon
Arlington.
She stated that she had spent nearly all
her money coming to California, and
would have to wait until her daughters
sent her more.
Inquiry at the Albany Hotel failed to
find any Mrs. Baldwin there as a gue>?t.
The letters to Arlington bore the print of
that hotel, but the envelopes might have
been secured for the purpose.
Arlington was convicted of swindling
Mrs. Mamie Smith a year ago, and JudgeÂ»
Hall gave him a life sentence, there hav
ing been three prior felony convictions
against him. Since r.ls incarceration in
the County Jail, the officials say. he hÂ«3
had a large correspondence, and almost
altogether with women.
Bates to Bakersneld Same as South

Court Is Now Consid
ering.
*
The Railroad Commissioners held a reg
ular meeting yesterday afternoon. The
most Important matter to come up was a
petition from the Santa Fe railroad ask
ing for the adoption of its new schedule
of passenger rates between this city and
Bakersfield. The Santa Fe's rates, ac
cording to the schedule, are the same as
those of the Southern Pacific, which have
been protested and are now awaiting the
pleasure of the Supreme Court.
The Santa Fe Company has fixed the
same rate as the Southern Pacific, its fig
ures to some of the more important points
being as follows: From San Francisco to
Antioch. $1 50; to Stockton, $2 50; to Mer
ced, SI 25; to Fresno, $5 90; to Guernsey.
17 05; to Bakersfleld. $9 10. The Commis
sioners were opposed to approving this
tariff until a decision had been rendered
by the Supreme Court in the Fresno case.
The board examined the Santa Fe tariff
carefully and found it to be in excess of
what it considers a just and reasonable
rate. The Santa Fe has consequently been
ordered to show cause, if any it has, why
Â¦the rates as set forth in the new tarlif
should not be reduced and a hearing has
been set for the afternoon of December 10.
The Commissioners voted to hold a
hearing on December 11 of the demurrers
of the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and
others relative to the action recently
brought by the Los' Angeles Traffic Asso
ciation. The board also instructed its
secretary to notify the railroad corpora
tions which have been delinquent in filing
their annual reports that the same must
be sent in immediately. The companies
that have not yet been heard from are
the Southern Pacific, McLeod River, Nev
ada, California and Oregon and the Na
tional City" and Otay.

Brandenstein said he had visited the
premises and failed to discover any dan
ger in the construction of the building.
Comte desired the reference of the reso
lution to the Judiciary Committee, so that
the board would continue to have the
building under Its control. Dwyer object
ed, as the Board of Public Works and
Fire Warden already have supervision
over the construction. Brandenstein ex
plained that the report that the building
was being constructed in violation of the
fire ordinance was unofficial, and the re
scinding of the permission had been rec
ommended on that score.
Brandenstein's resolution revoking the
license of the Alta Theater and ordering
the Immediate closing of the playhouse
was referred to the Fire Committee. Ber
nard L.eszynsky, owner of the theater
building, stated that he knew nothing
about the steps taken against his house
except what he had reaa In the newspa
pers. He promised to do all in his power
to make required alterations.
A resolution was adopted directing the
Board of Public Works to Investigate the
estimated cost to the city and Interested
property owners of reducing the widths
of the sidewalks on Clement street from
19 to 15 feet and Division street from 10 to
7 feet. ,^_
The conditional acceptance of Twenty
fifth street, between Guerrero and San
Jose avenue, paved with bituminous rock,
was passed to print.
Several ordinances and resolutions were
laid over for one week owing to insuffi
cient publication.
The board adjourned to meet on Wed
nesday night to take up consideration of
the water question. ~
The resolution rescinding the permis
sion granted to the Central Park Amuse
ment Company to build a gravity rail
way and construct a temporary building
of iron adjoining in Central Park was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee.
Ivan Treadwell and others were granted
an extension of ninety days within which
to complete the grading, macadamizing,
etc., of Grove. Clayton, Masonic avenue
and contiguous streets.
The bill directing each officer of the
city government to file annually in the
clerk's office of the board an inventory
of all personal property under hlB charge
belonging to the city was passed to print.
The Board of Public Works was direct
ed to secure for use of the city such lamps
as have been appropriated for other uses.
The board is also authorized to replace
eleven bronze lamps belonging to the city
and formerly located around the City
Hall, with others of similar pattern, the
expense to bo paid out of a surplus of
$2745 S9 in the street lighting fund.
Supervisor Reed desired to know if tha
ordinance was intended to repeal the
charter, and called attention to the fore
going facts, but the measure prevailed.
Sec. 32. The Supervisors shall select some
place in the city and county which shall be
known as the corporation Btore yard, wherein
shall be kept all supplies, material, imple
ments and machines belonginK to the city and
county, to be used in repairing or cleaning
and sprinkling the streets or for any improve
ment theron. All cobblestones or stone
blocks or other material with which any street
or portion of a street may have been paved
or planked shall, if at any time removed from
said street, be taken to said yard and thero
kept, accounted for and disposed of by the
storekeeper in the same manner as other sup
plies.
Provided said departments file with the
Board of Public Works requisitions for ma
terial required and that they bear all tha
costs of transportation.
In the chapter relating to the Board of
Public Works the charter says:
Authority is hereby conferred on the Board
of Public Works to dispose of all street ma
terial removed from the public streets whlcii
is no longer fit for use thereon to the Board
of Park Commlfsloners or any other depart
ments of the municipality desiring to use tha
same.
This action was taken notwithstanding
that the illegality of the procedure was
pointed out when the ordinance was rec
ommended for passage by the Street
Committee. To demonstrate the conflict
of the ordinance with the charter it is but
necessary to read the language of both
.side by fide. The ordinance says:
The ordinance authorizing the Board of
Public Works to dispose of all street ma
terial removed from the public streets
which Is unfit for further use thereon to

AWAY ILLEGALLY
An ordinance was passed to print or
dering thÂ« laying of artificial stone side
walks at the crossing of Buchanan and
Filbert streets; cranite curbs on Centrah
avenue between Page and Haleht streets:
bituminous rock on the roadway at the
crossing of Page street and Central ave
nue; artificial stone walks at the cross
ing of Thirtieth and Dolores street?, Â«T<*n
lte curbs nn Thirtieth street between Do
lores and Chenerv streets and an artificial
stone walk on the crossing at Eddy and
Steiner ptreots.
An authorization for J5S4 40 for thÂ»
maintenance of inmates at the "Whittler
Reform School was passed.
The California-street Cable Railroad
was granted permission to install a tank
of 7000 gallons capacity for storing crude
petroleum In its powerhouse.
Authorizations were passed for the pay
ment to W. P. Cordes of the sum of $502
and to Joseph Frederics & Co. $S75 on the
contract to furnish carpets for the Hall
of Justice.
The request of the Board of Puhllc
Works to be authorized to enter into a
contract for the sweeping of public streets
beginning January 1. 1901. and terminat
ing June 30, 1901. at an estimated cost of
$90,000 was referred to the Street Com-
The communication of John Nightingale,
calling attention to the advisability of
paving Market street between Van Xess
avenue and Valencia with bituminous
rock, thus making a uniform pavement
from Sansome to Castro streets, was re
ferred to the Street Committee.
The ordinance provides for the paving
with bituminous rock on a basalt . base j
of Sacramento street from Montgomery
to Battery at a cost of $S320; of Clay
street from Montgomery to Battery street
at a cost of $3120; of Grant avenue from
OFarrell to Bush at a cost of $7087, less
J250u to be contributed by property .own
ers; of Pine street from Sansomu to Bat
tery at a cost of $2193.
Reed objected to its passage on the
ground that the board had been pledged
to remove cobblestones throughout the
downtown district.
"There is a duty resting upon us to re
meve cobblestones," said Reed, "and to
pave certain streets with the best pave
ment. I object to paving a street with
bituminous rock on a basalt base, as it
is the worst kind of pavement. Any bro
ken-down politician would do that for
the city, but we should have a pavement
that will stand the heavy traffic. This ad
ministration stands for the best pavement
there is, even if we must pave a less num
ber of streets."
Curtis pleaded that there were no funds
available for the best pavement. The
Board of Public "Works had recommended
the work with the understanding that a
guarantee of maintenance for ten years
should be required. Curtis agreed with
Reed that a concrete foundation was
preferable to any other, but Tobin
thought the wisdom of the Board of Pub
lic Works in recommending the inferior
pavement should be deferred to. City En
gineer Grunsky said the bituminous pave
ment on depressed cobbles had been tried
with success In other cities, but results
were not as good as on a concrete founda
tion. The difference in cost would war
rant the use of the cheaper pavement,
as the expense would be reduced by 25 per
cent. Brandenstein objected to an exper
imental pavement and McCarthy contend
ed that the cheaper pavement would not
stand heavy teaming. On motion of Reed
the resolution was referred back to the
Street Committee and the Board of Pub
lic "Works with directions to determine
what it would cost to pave the streets
named in the best way known to engi
neering science.
The resolution requesting the Superin
tendent of Schools to notify the board
whether or not hÂ«* would audit demands
for repairs provided the Boards of Pub
lic Works and Education acting jointly
caused such work to be done, was adopted.
Mayor Phelan called attention to the ar
ticle published in Sunday's Call in which
Auditor Wells stated that he had been
advised by his attorneys that the signa
ture of the Superintendent was not neces
sary on demands for schoolhouse repairs.
His Honor held that the adoption of the
resolution would be unnecessary. Comte
objected to it. as it 6imply contained a
request, and Braunhart held that "it was
an arrogant assumption on the part of
any official to place the Political Code
ab<5Ye the charter in the government of
his office."
An ordinance presented at the meeting
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday
providing for the pavement of several
downtown streets with bituminous rock
on a basalt or cobblestone foundation
met with considerable opposition. Sev
eral members objected to that kind of
pavement on the ground that a concrete
foundation was manifestly superior to the
other.

POOR PAVEMENT.
A* many persons are discouraged by the
prepa rations made In vain for several
years r-'st to observe the meteoric show
rrs of November, it is well to recall the
fact that the last appearance of Leonids
in great numbers took place in 1S67. and
as their period Is about thirty-three years

TTnllke other astronomical phenomena,
this eosmlc&l display has not verified pre

proved correct to an astonishing degree.
Estimates of the length and breadth of
the ewarm being chiefly conjectural, re

ferences that can be drawn from inade

While delay cools interest and uncer

THE LARGEST FLEET OF STEAMERS THAT HAS MADE PORT IN MANY A DAT CAME IN YESTERDAY. THE
CHINA L&D THE WAY, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE WHALING STEAMER BELVEDERE. AFTER
. THEM CAME A STRING OF COASTERS.
A BIG fleet of steamers made
port yesterday. There was a
fair wind, but, strange to say,
the "wind-jammers" did not
show up until sundown, while
the steamers came' along in a bunch.
Among those that came in during the day
were the Pomona from Eureka, the San
ta Barbara from San Pedro, the Luella
from San Pedro, the Sequoia from Fort
Bragg, the Willamette from Seattle, the
City of Panama from Central America,
the Bessie K from Uyak, Alaska, th<?
Senator from Puget Sound and the steam
whaler Belvedere from Fox Island.
The China brought sixty-seven cabin
passengers and a lot of Chinese in the
steerage. The cabin passengers were al
lowed to land, but the/vessel was held in
quarantine. Among those who came up
In the cabin wa& C. Bagdonovitch, the
manager of the Russian expedition that
went to Siberia on the steamer Samoa.
There was a conflict of authority, and the
Samoa, instead of remaining on the Sibe
rian coast, went back to Cape Nome. Mr.
Bagdonovitch asserts he has a claim
against the owners of the Samoa for
breach of contract and has come half
way around the world to collect his dam
ages. The lawsuit that is sure to follow
will bring to light some particulars of tha
Samoa's exciting voyage.
The China will dock to-day.
The Belvedere comes in from the Arc
tic with only 3000 pounds of bone. Last
year she had a very successful season,
but on this occasion she only took one
whale, and that a small one .
The Senator is from Cape Nome, but
stopped at the sound on her way here,
and therefore brings no news. The Bes
sie K also comes from the gold fields, but
as she left long before the Senator ho*"
He Will Tell About "Our New Posses
sessions" at Metropolitan Tern- .
piÂ© Thursday Night.
San Franciscans are to be (riven an op
portunity to hear what the Rev. Father
W. D. McKlnnon, U. S. A., post chaplain
at Manila, has to say of the Philippines.
On Thursday night next, for the benefit
of his old parish, that of Suisun, Father
McKlnnon will deliver at Metropolitan
Temple a lecture on "Our New Posses
sions, the Philippines; What Shall We Do
With Them? 71
A lecture by this bright and observing
priest on this subject at the present time
should pack the temple with intelligent
people. On Friday Father McKinnon will
leave on the transport Sheridan for
Manila to resume his duties in the land
where he won fame as chaplain of the
First California Regiment.
Four Filipino youths whom Chaplain
McKinnon brought over here ten months
ago to be educated will furnish instru
mental muslÂ£ and sing Filipino songs.
They are excellent performers on stringed
instruments and sing well. The First
Regiment band will also be in attendance.
Tickets will be 50 cents, and may be ob
tained at Glldea's clothing store, corner
Grant avenue and Market street. There
will be no reserves. The lecture will be
illustrated with stereopticon views.

H. E. Huntington, vice president of the

yesterday afternoon from New York,

coast being broken by a visit to his
former home in Cincinnati and also a
ehort stay in Chicago.
Mr. Huntirgton will remain In San

least, when it Is said he will return to
New york to look after the Interests of
his late uncle's *stat<\ Mr. Huntingdon
was not Inclined to talk about his future

be evasive The feeling is that there it
no great hurry about the matter, anyway.

H. E. HUNTIHGTON

and It Is likely that hÂ» will remain in the
office until Mr. Hays rets the run of af
fairs.
Although he has been expected for sev
eral days few of the officials in the bi=r
yellow building on Montgomery streor
were aware of Mr. Huntington's arrival
yesterday afternoon, and his appearance
at the office this morning is likely to
arouse more or less surprise.
"I had a very interesting trip, but I am
more than over convinced that there is no
place in Europe or America bo desirable
so interesting or so much to be admired
for all that a man cares for In life as San
Francisco and California." x
"American exhibits compared most fa
vorably with exhibits of other countries"
and the large number of awards indicate
the excellence of our productions The
fruit and wine exhibits from California
were the finest of the fair and were more
generally commended than any other All
of which makes the Callfornian prouder
of his State and more anxious than Â»vÂ»r
to return to it.
"The hospitality of the commissioners
to all Americans is commendable. They
have made every one as welcome as pos
sible, and the American department hai
made itself conspicuous by giving recep
tions and concerts In the United States
Pavilion e/very night. This offered a
splendid opportunity for the Americans to
find each other, and no pleasure was moro
keen or heartfelt than that of grasping
the hand of a fellow-countryman so far
from home. The 9th of September -was
celebrated by the California contingent
with more than ordinary enthusiasm and
often that day I longed to be In San
Francisco to enjov the festivities which
we so eagerly .read about in three weeks
old papers. .
"From Italy we went to France, visiting
Nice, Monte Carlo. Marseilles and'. Paris.

bigger than any one can realize; in fact.
It would take a string; of circus adver

"I was much impressed with the 'Pas

tinent, of course a tremendous crowd
makes up the audience â people from all
over the world. It's a grand sight, but
one wouldn't care to go through the tc
dlousness of watching it all day and the
discomforts of crowded hotels, trains and
carriages to see it again.
"Another very interesting incident was
my visit to the celebration of the serv
ices at St. Peter's in Rome, where I saw
the Pope. There were over 50,000 pepple
in attendance. It is really remarkable
how the. tourist will put up with so much
inconvenience and torture of long waitin?
in vast crowds to satisfy his curiosity
and desire to see some noted personage
or thing the world is talking about.
"I put| in the first two weeks traveling
and taking things easy in the south of
Ireland along the Lakes of Killarney. I
saw everything worth seeing, Including
the Blarney stone, which, of course, I
couldn't pass without kissing. I spent
about ten days in England, most of the
time in London. The English capital Is
rapidly adopting American ways and con

ALMOST as much curiosity as to
the personnel 'of the audience
was manifest last night at
the Columbia Theater as In the
sweller and more classic haunts
on Mission street, for assuredly every one
who was not enjoying grand opera with
Melba and the rest was taking in Frank
Daniels and the latest Herbert success,
"The Ameer."
"You here!"
"And. you!" was heard.
"Well, to tell you the truth, I " .
"I don't mind telling youâ that- 1 â '
"When it comes right down to it. I "
Arid strangely enough, the rest of the
reason, explanation or excuse was always
delivered in an impossible sotto voce, and
it is therefore quite impossible to under
stand why a stunning houseful of re
spectable theater-g-oers should be in one
place rather , than anotherâ on Mission
street.
"The Ameer" is like all the Herbert
operas â full of bright, catchy music, a lit
tle short on songs, may be, with an ex
travaganza plot and comic situations ga
lore.
It is, of course, excellently staged. The
scenery is gorgeously picturesque, the
costumes smart, fit and splendid and the
chorus girls as pretty and shapely as they
make them. . ,
Frank Daniels, with his humorous fig
ureâhe looked so comically like Mary
Marble in the inevitable Cakewalk â his
irresistible countenance and dry drollery
was admirably suited as Iffe Kahn, the
Ameer, whose various adventures as
owner of a harem, chief partner in an
up-to-date brigand plant and deceiver gen
eral to the British authorities in Cabul,
form the story of the opera.

Tivoli.
The last week of the grand opera sea
son at the Tivoli had an auspicious open-
Ing last' night with a splendid production
of "Ernani." The principals were evident
ly on their mettle as a result of the ad
vent- of their Mission-street rivals, and
barrinpr the interminably long waits be
tween the acts the opera was sung with a
spirit and dash that were highly credita
ble. '
Nicolinl's rendering of Don Silva was
all that could be desired, and the singing
and actinjr of this capable artist were ad
mirable. The resonant quality of his voice
was heard to great advantage in the "In
felicp." and he" received a well merited en-
j At the next session of the Legislature a
bill will be introduced to reimburse Clau3
Spreckels for money advanced on the
credit of the State to relievo distressed
farmers in Monterey and San Luis Obispo
counties. If the bill becomes a law Mr.
Spreckels will immediately convey the
sum appropriated to the State University.
He has so informed President Wheeler.
Mr. Spreckels does not ask relmburs-e
j ment for himself, but he recognizes that
there is a principle involved which con
cerns the credit of the State and thereforo
consents that the measure shall be pre
sented to the Legislature, with the un
j dcrstandingihat he Is not to be the benc
i flciary in a pecuniary sense.
At the last regular session of the Leg's
lature a measure providing for his reim
bursement passed both houses without a
dissenting vote, but failed to receive ex
ecutive sanction. It is a fact well known
that Governor Budd in 1898 asked Mr.
Spreckels to advance money to relieve
destitute farmers and as Governor pledged
the honor of the commonwealth lhaf tho
money so advanced should be returned.
The principle at stake is whether Ilia
credit of the State shall be maintained.
Many members of the Legislature insist
that it should be respectedâ that every
dollar advanced on the honor of the State
and wisely disbursed by a commission" ap
pointed by the Governor of the State shall
be repaid. The question is wholly Inde
pendent of the disposition Mr. Spreckeis
may make of the money.
A review of the events and Incidents
of the relief movement Is not out of placa
at this time:
In the fall of 1S98 articles published in
the press drew the attention of the people
of tue State to the destitute condition of
some 500 families in Monterey and San
Luis Obispo counties. Four bad crop sea
sons, the last one a season of drought
that produced no crops and not even for
age tor stock, had reduced the ranchers
to a pitiable condition. Horses and cattle
were starving, and the farmers were
forced to sacrifice whatever livestock
they had left by selling it practically for
nothing. A few horses and cows were, all
that was left of the herds of sleek cattle
and bands of horaes that had been the
pride of every ranch before the drought
had put lts.oiight on nature. The people
themselves were destitute, and starvation
faced them unless outside aid was ex
tended.
The situation and the urgency of steps
for relief being taken at once were laid
before Governor Budd by a representative
of The Call, and it was suggested to him
that some public-spirited citizen might be
found wno would advance money under
the assurance that he would be reimburs
ed, as "was. done in 18S5, when Charles
Crocker advanced $50,000 for the support
of San Quentin Prison through an emer
gency period when no funds were avail
able.
Governor Budd appreciated the neces
sities of the case, but doubted if any one
could be found ready to advance the
amount needed. It was suggested that
Claus Spreckels be approached on the
subject, and on December 19 Governor
Budd and The Call representative went to
Mr. Spreckels and laid the matter before
him. Mr. Spreckels at once wrote a check
for $50,000. Governor Budd was delight
j ed, but said that half that amount would
j be sufficient. He explained that the re
imburspment would depend wholly upon
the Legislature's willingness to pass a
bill providing for It. Mr. Spreckels said
he was willing to advance the money and
take the chance of Its return. He was
already supporting fifty families in that
region, and had advanced $50,000 to them
to tide them over the drought season and
ur.til rains and good crops should afford
them relief. Mr. Spreckels accordingly
made out another check for $25,000 and
turned It over to the Governor.
Governor Budd at once appointed a
commission of three to control the ex
penditure of the relief fund. lie named

Phelan and K. W. Dohrmann, president of
the Merchants' Association. The com
mission met promptly, elected L. M King
superintendent of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, as its secretary, and at once en
tered upon the work of relieving the suf
ferers.
Great satisfaction was expressed on all
sides at the prompt and practical solu
tion of the problem. Instead of the de
lay and annoyances attendant upon rais
inp a fund by popular subscription and a
possible blow to State pride bv the so
licitation of aid in the East, there' was
immediate aid, extended in a manner that
diu no violence to State or individual
pride.
In accordance with the understanding
between Governor Budd and Mr Spreck
els a bill was introduced in the Assembly
on February 2. 1899. by Assemblyman Bur
nett of San Luis. Obispo County provid
ing for the reimbursement of Mr. Spreck
els to the amount of the $25,000 that, had
I been or should be expended. The bill
passed both houses without a dissenting
vote.
The Legislature adjourned March 19 be
fore the lapse of the ten days in which
I the bill had to be acted upon by the Gov
1 ernor. The executive took no action and
on March 20 the commission In charge of
! the fund wrote to him asking what his
j Intention was. He replied, contending that
i the fund was a gift, and could not be ro
! turned from the public treasury lie
j still, however, did not veto the bill di-
I rect, but let the pocket veto kill it at
the lapse of ten days after the Legis
lature's adjournment. That was on March
29 and the next day the commission met
and decided that, although relief for the
sufferers was still needed, no i more
should be expended from the fund, in
vlew of Governor Gage's action. A total
of $11.(575 82 had been expended., The re
mainder of the $25,000 was returned to
Mr. Spreckels. Ranchers to whom relief
had been extended had forced upon the
commission their notes to the amount of
J9784 20, but these, by request of Mr
Spreckels, were returned to the makers

The action of the Board of Public Works
and the Fire Wardens In condemning the
Alta Theater, on Grove street, resulted
last night in the closing of that place. No
performance was given and none of those
interested in the venture were about the
premises. Until some changes are made
in thes tructural arrangements of the
place it is not the intention of the present
management to reopen.'

"A Young Wife," Tillotson's comedy
drama, on this week at the Alhambra,
may be placed among the strong plays
produced at that theater this season.
Though the play is not strictly a- comedy
there Is just enough humor sprinkled
through the lines to keep up the cheer of
the audience, which threatens at times to
ebb at the increasing tragical climaxes
woven into the fabric of the plot. Frank
Tannehlll Jr., as Horace Greengage Dob
bins, centralizes the Interest of the audl
dience and gains its approval by unmask
ing "the villain." a part weir played by
Krnest Howard. Ethelyn Palmer and
Carl Stockdale 1 are equally good In the
difficult roles they assume. The house was
well filled lnst evening, which may be ac
cepted as indicative of larger houses dur

They kept Billy Hynes so far back on
the programme last nfght that he looked
actually nervous when he faced the
friendly critics and his critical friends.
His, stage fright caused him almost to
spoil a joke, out when he got past the girl
with the pair of thin reasons for wearing
more than one pair of stockings he bright
ened up and was not quite so bashful. He
made a hit all right, and It wasn't a
'base-bawl" hit either, when he sang.
Comic singing is his forte, and his brogue
is the genuine article. He should give a
little more- of !t In his monologue. Billy
will do: that was the verdict of the vaude
ville public last night. There still remain
a few rough amateurish angles to smooth
off. but a week or so before the footlights
will sandpaper him all over with the real
polish.

core. Barbareschl sang: Elvira with much
feeling, though her acting seemed to lack
fire. Castellano's Ernanl was well done,
but he was rather uncertain in spots. He
was equal to the exacting requirements of
the part, however, and his high notes
were given with magnificent' force. Fer
rari's Don Carlos was sung with the usual
good grace of the sturdy little barytone,
and the round tones of his magnificent
voice are a joy forever.

quarter a few days apo tha old cobbler
accosted him and complained that Took
and bis wife had borrowed $7oO from him
and that as they were preparing to return
to China he wanted to know how he couid
compel them to refund the amount. After
beinp advised to commence suit against
them the old man walked along Waverly
place, where he met Took and the woman
whom Took claims as his wife. The cob
bler demanded his money back, when the
Chinaman and the woman turned on him
end threatened to "do him up" if he ever
Fpoke to them apain. They then walked
away, leaving the aped cobbler tearfully
bewailing- the loss of his money. Meetir.gr
