CALL. BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct.
3. â Further consideration- of the
proposition submitted by the Ger
man Government through Baron
von Sternburg, German Charge d'Affalres,
relative to the designation and punishment
of the responsible authors of the Chinese
outrage?, convinces the officials that they
open the way to a settlement of the entire
Chinese question. The officials do not
conceal the fact that they had feared tnat
Germany contemplated delaying the ad-
Jusiment of the entire question in the hope
of obtaining territorial reparation for the
murder of her Mln'ster and for injuries
sustained by her subjects, and that the
proposition to force the Chinese Govern
ment to surrender to* the allies those Chi
nese who would te designated by the Min
isters at Peking was In line with this par
pose. This apprehension has been largely
dissipated by the new suggestions which
have been advanced. They are in Hne to
a great degree with the views of this Gov
ernment, and it la expected that Secretary
Hay in his reply. will show the satisfac
tion felt by this Government at the change
they make in Germany's position.
It is understood to be the purpose of this
Government to take advantage of the re
newal of the concert .between the nations
to formulate a method of settlement of
the entire Chinese question, and this will
be discussed by the President and hi3
Cabinet when Mr. McKinley returns to
Washington., The adoption of a common
line of action by all the powers i3 be
lieved to be possible In view of Germany's
apparent desire to re-establish harmony.
In connection with the character of pun
ishment that the Chinese Government will
be required to Impose attention has been
directed In official circles to the reply of
the German Emperor to the communica
tion addressed to him by the Emperor of
China. The reply Is looked upon as a very
Important state' document. It shows that
the Emperor -himself proposes to be the
judge not only as to the sufficiency of pun
ishment but as to those who should be
punished for the outrages, and Is In ac
cord with the note he has addressed to
the powers to brin'g about a concurrent
action on these points. The Emperor fur
ther specifically indicates whom he re
gards as responsible, "but advisers of
your Majesty's throne and officials upon
whoso heads rest the blood of the crime
which nils all Christendom with horror
must." he says, "expiate their abominable
deed."
This Indicates clearly the exaction to
which the Imperial Government must sub
mit, and mayhave an Important effect In
stirring up those who are Implicated to
induce the Imperial' authorities to renew
their attitude of hostility to the demand
of the foreign powers.

OF TROUBLE
NEBRASKA CITY. Nebr.. Oct. 3.â
In the Conservative of to-day J.
Sterling Morton replies to Bry
an's speech indorsing the action
of the Attorney General of Ne
braska in trying to close the starch fac
tory at this place. Mr. Morton among
other declarations says:,.
"Bryan assumes and asserts that the
starch factory is not controlled by the
people of Nebraska City. In this he de
liberately tells an untruth. The same
men who originated the starch factory
control it now. They never didâ as assert
ed by Bryan â close down the factory and
throw helpless operatives out of employ
ment. From year to year they have en
larged the works and put more money
into Nebraska City. The men whom Bry
an has the effrontery to warn the people
cf Nebraska City against are the men
who with their friends built the starch
works and lost toO.000 during the early
years of starch making In Nebraska, but
who, without State aid or Interference,
put another $30,000 into a continuance of
the starch-making experiment and suc
cessfully established this Industry In Ne
braska. "When Colonel Bryan knows more
about the truth he will know that the
people' of Nebraska are not In fa
vor of the destruction of the com
pany operating the local factory.
The National Starch Company Is not
a trust as that term Is legally denned
by the Court of Appeals of the State of
New York In the case of the people of
New York, respondent, vs. the North Riv
er Sugar Refining Company. The action
brought against it . proves that. Bryan
and his Populist associates are inimical
to industrial plants which pay wages to
hundreds and work up millions of dollars'
worth of raw material each year. â¢ It Is a
notice for capital to get out of Nebraska
and keep out. Disaster. is desired by Bry
an. He cannot live politically without ca
lamity. When God and nature have this
year made distress impossible by kindly
giving good crops, health and prosperity
to the people. Bryan and Smith propose
artificial calamity by legal process. It Is
essential to fusion success. For that suc
cess these two men would sacrifice capi
tal, labor, prosperity, wage earners and
Nebraska City Itself. They are twin dy
namos to general discontent, to paralyze
prosperity and shatter thrift. They are
mere phonographs of a political piracy In
the city of New York which has corrupted
and robbed that municipality for a gener
ation.

COUNCIL. BLUFfS. Iowa. Oct. 3.â
Two men held up a passenger
train on the Burlington road,
three miles south of this city,
Charles Baxter shot and killed one of the
robbers, and his body now lies In the
Morgue in this city. He was about six
feet tall, powerfully built, apparently
about 45 years of age and has black hair
end mustache.
The two men boarded the train at Union
Pacific Transfer and climbed over the
tender just as the train was crossing the
Mosquito Creek bridge. Engineer Don
nelly and Frank Holman, fireman, who
were in. charge of the enjfine, were or
dered to 'slow up as soon as the train
had crossed the bridge. While the man
cfterward killed held a revolver on the en
gine .crew his companion went back and
cut off the baggage and mail cars, leav
ing the day coaches and sleepers standing
on the main line.
Acting under orders the engineer pulled
the .train half a mile down the track,
where a stop was made. Here the rob
bers approached the express car and or
dered Messenger Baxter to open the door.
He refused to do so. Under compulsion
Engineer Donnelly attached a stick of
dynamite to the side door of the car and
blew it 1 open. In the meantime Messen
ger "Baxter seized his gun and escaped
from the door on the opposite side of the
car. As soon as the door was opened one
of the robbers entered . the car, while his
companion marched the engineer and
fireman back to the engine.
Baxter crept around in front of the en
gine and, seeing the robber standing
guard over the engine crew, fired one shot,
killing him instantly. As soon as the shot
was heard, the robber in the car Jumped
to the ground and fled through a corn
field.
The dead man was picked up, placed on
board and the train backed into this city.
The body was searched, but nothing was
found en it by which it could be identi
fied. The dead robber was dressed , in a
neat salt of black clothes, over which
overalls and Jumper had been drawn. In
the pockets was found about $13 in money
and a watch and chain.'
Conductor ''William McGrew, who was
In charge of the train, thinks the dead
man is one George of St. Joseph.
The robber -who escaped was larger and
taller" than the dead' man, being appar
ently above six feet in height. Both men
were masked and both wore overalls and
jumpers. â¢ *â¢: "i

"It is hardly worth while to deny the
charge of a man who hides behind a

in order that the most unscrupulous Ro

one ever offered, promised or gave me
that sum or any other for urging that

Presbytery has voted for a revision of the
Westminster confession of faith.
Secretary Root will recommend the
necessary legislation in- his forthcoming
annual report, but it is not believed It will
be effective, as there is considerable op
position to giving General Shafter promo
tion. In any event, under the law Gen
eral Shafter's commission as major gen
eral of volunteers will expire in June next
and it is not believed that he will suffer
any hardship should he be relieved from
the command of the Department of Cali
fornia in the meantime. General Otis will
probably prefer California to Chicago, as
much of his life has been spent in the
West.
General Shafter Is now serving as com
mander of the Department of California
under his volunteer commission. He
reached the retiring age In October last,
but in view of his record during the Span
ish war the President determined to re
ward him by keeping him on the active
list as major general of volunteers at
least until Congress could have an oppor
tunity to promote him to the grade of
major general on the retired list. Con
gress had the opportunity last winter, but
failed to take advantage of it.

The train stopped at Crawford lonp
enough for Governor Roosevelt to show
himself on a platform In the middle of the
town. This is essentially a cattle-crowing
country. Governor Roosevelt said:
Out here where you raise cattle not
only the amount of cattle but the value
of them have increased anywhere from
40 to 60 per cent. Now, under our free
government it is our inalienable right to
make fools of ourselves if we wish, and
if you want to go back: to the old condi

can go right back into the slough out of
which we worked our way four years ago
by putting into power the party which for
forty years has never done any construc
tive work, but has always criticized and
has generally criticized wrong."
The train made a short stop at Hyannis,
w pere Governor Roosevelt said in part:
Mr. Towne has been appealing to our
people against keeping the Philippines on
the ground that they have under the Sul
tan of Sum polygamy and slavery. Now.
how will it be stopped if we go away' If

of the United States Commissioners
to the Paris Exposition, stopped over in
Canton to-day. He came to make a for
mal report to the President and to ar
range for a reception to the whole board.
This reception will be held in Washington
soon after election.
Mr. de Young left during the afternoon
for his home In San Francisco, where he
will take part in the campaign. He ex
pressed himself as heartily in favor of
not only retaining the Philippines and
other possessions coming to the United
States as the result of the war with
Spain but of making them self-governing
territories as rapidly as possible with free
Interchange of products.
"We need them," he said, "for we must
have an outlet for our surplus products.
They give us natural advantages that it
would be worse than fo!ly to reject. They
give us what the Old World is constantly,
exerting itself to secureâ a basis for large
and profitable trade in the Orient."
No date has been fixed for a return to
Washington. Governor Roosevelt is com

HAZLETON. Pa., Oct. 3.â President
Mitchell was informed of the circulation
of a story to the effect that he hail
reached an agreement witn the presidents
of the coal mining and coal carrying rail
roads. After verbally denying the report
he issued the following:
To the mine-workers of the anthracite re
gion: We have; Just been informed that the
report has been circulated at Ashland 'to the
effect that In a conference in New York this
morningr between the conl presidents and myself
an agreement was reached which will end the
Â»-trike. I desire to notify all mine-workers that
the report is incorrect, and that 1 have not been
in conference with the presidents of the coal
companies and have made no agreement with
them. I wish to reiterate what I aalcl several
dnys ago, that there would be no settlement of
the strike until a convention of the anthracite
miners, is held. You are further requested to
pay no attention to statements of this kind
and to continue the strike until such conces
sions are made by the operators as will Justify
us in calling; a general convention, when you
will be regularly notified of the date and place
at which the convention will be held.
The time limit of the Lackawanna
Company's offer of increased wages will
expire to-morrow, but the strikers gener
ally express their determination to pay
no attention to the offer.
A secret conference of the leading offi
cials of the miners' organization was
held at Hazleton. At its conclusion Presi
dent Mitchell said the question of call
ing a joint convention had not been con
sidered. He added that out of 142,000 mine
workers only about 5000 are at work and
these, he said, would be out in a short
time. .
; â¢ that in addition to its offer of 10
per cent it was willing to enter into ar
bitration, with them relative to any griev
ances they may have. None of the strik
ers, however, has yet indicated an inten
tion to return to work. Affairs were ex

Social Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â To-day there
wore two sharp reductions In the pric?
of refined sugar amounting in the aggre
gate to 40 f)oints, or 40 cents a hundred
pounds.
The price for the standard grade of re
fined sugar is now E.75 cents, against 6.15
cents a pound, previous list price. Cuts
were made by both the National Sugar
Refining Company and the Arbuckles and
all concessions on quantity lots were
withdrawn, and representative men In the
trace remarked that it was doubtful if
refined sugar could be sold at any price,
in consequence of the disturbance.
An explanation of the remarkable cuts
v.-as made by one representative of the
Arbuckles. who said: "It would not sur
prise us if the entire demonstration over
the reduction in price was the result of
the sugar trust being short of raw sugar
and that !t started the reduction for the
purpose of stopping the business in re
fined sugar awaiting the arrival of it*
supply of the raw article.
"The first cut was made by the sugar
trust and amounted to fifteen cents open
ly and five cents secretly, so that when
we put our price at 5.95 we were only fol
lowing the trust's secret out. This had
the effect of demoralizing the trade abso
lutely and it is doubtful if sugar can be
sold at any price at the present time "
Mr. Havemeyer of the sugar trust could
not be found at his office to-day, and no
explanation of the cuts were obtainable
from that office.
James H. Post, president of the Nation
al company, when asked if the cuts in
dicated a resumption of the sugar war

Republicans, show me a document ever penned
by a modern Republican that will compare with
the Declaration of Independence. Show me
a speech made by a Republican of to-day that
will have the influence of the Declaration of
Independence. That Declaration of Independ
ence has been read all over the world. In
South Dakota I met . Governor Lee, a Nor
wegian by birth, who away off in distant Nor
way had read the Declaration t>t Independence
tnd It had drawn him here, and he is now
a Governor of a great State. â¢ In Minnesota I

At Watertown Mr. Bryan spoke in the
Turner Opera-house because of the in
clemency of the weather. The building
was packed and the audience was very
enthusiastic. He said that at the begin
ning of its history the Republican party
had confessed to be a follower of Jeffer
son. Now Jefferson's name was never
mentioned, but Alexander Hamilton had
become their great exemplar. Hamilton
had taught that society was divided into
two classes, the well born and the lowly,
born and that the well born were entitled
to govern the lowly born. It was un
necessary, Bryan said, to state that Ham
ilton considered himself well born. Men
who taught that doctrine always classed
themselves with what they considered the
better class. This was the dominating
thought of the Republican party of the
present day. and therefore Jefferson's
doctrine of the equality of men was no
longer promulgated by 'the members of
that party.
Bryan chided the Republicans for fall
ing to mention the Declaration of Inde
pendence in their, Philadelphia platform.
He said in this connection:
Mr. Bryan said to-night that he would
give the Sth and 9th of this month to
Illinois^ the 10th and 11th to Michigan,
and the 12th, 13th and 15th to Ohio. He
will go direct from Cleveland to New
York, reaching that city at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon before he is to speak in
Madison-square Garden.
The meeting at Columbus was held on
the vacant ground at the east side of the
tow-n from the railroad station. A large
number of people had assembled there,
but many of them were freightened away
by the showers of rain'durlng the speech
making. Mr. Bryan discussed the issues
of the campaign, declaring that no man
had the right to own and govern another.
"If there are any Irishmen here," he said,
"I want to ask them how long it will take
Ireland to become reconciled to foreign
domination, even with only a narrow
channel of the sea between Ireland and
the land of her governess."
The lesson he drew was that if. the peo
ple of Ireland found it hard to reconcile
themselves to English government It must
be quite as difficult for the Filipinos, so
much farther away, to accept our domi
nation.
WAUKESHA. Vis.. Oct. 3.â Bryan had

At this juncture Adlai E. Stevenson was
escorted into the hall by a band, and his
appearance sent the convention into a
pandemonium of applause. The demon
stration continued for some time after
Mr. Stevenson had taken his seat on the
rostrum. He had not intended to speak,
but finally yielded to the clamor and said:
"My fellow Democrats, I thank you for
this cordial greeting. I would not under

Dr. Miller Wilson and wife, Mr. White
house and wife. The list is very incom
plete, but it is certain that in all thirty
three white persons were slain. Accord
ing to reports current here and at Peking
the Governor of Shansi sent a dispatch to
the Peking .Government reporting the
massacre and demanding a reward.
Thirty-five miles from Taiyuan is* the
English Baptist mission of Hslnchou, on
the great road. There were at Hsinchou
six persons, and their fate is unknown
They are Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, Mr. and i
Mrs. McCurran and two single persons. ;
At the outbreak of the trouble it Is re
ported the entire party fled to *he moun
tains, escaping safely from the village.
Since then no word has been heard of
them, and their fate is conjectural. It is
possible that they may have reached a
place of safety, but diligent inquiries
have failed to locate them.
Owing to the friendliness of the local
official at Taiku. which is about twenty
miles from Taiyuan. the American BoarJ
mission there escaped the first attacKs
upon foreigners. About July 31 a band
of 300 Boxers swept down upon the place
and attacked the mission premises. One
of the native missionary assistants was
killed, and the Boxers, smashing the
pates of the compound, effected an en
trance. There were six persons in the
mlssion-F. W. Davis, C. D. Williams. D.
H. Clapp and wife. Miss Rowena Ford
and Miss Susan Partridge. The three
men took a position on the roof of the
mission building: and made a gallant de
fense until their sparse ammunition was
exhausted. The Boxers rushed them and
they were cut down, fighting to the last
wifh clubbed guns. The three women
then fled to the rear court, where they
were discovered and slain, as was also a
native woman teacher. The bodies were
thrown into the flames of the burning
mission building, after having been be
headed. The heads were taken to Tai
yuan and placed in the baskets on the
Kate, and it is eaid the hearts of the men
were cut out and carried to Peking. One
hundred native Christians were killed at
the sarao time, sixty-five of them being
converts of the Roman Catholic mission.
These people had no means of resistance
and were simply slaughtered.
The report covers only a portion of the
mnny mission stations, and the fate of
other pp.rtks is unknown. The native
u-acher tells his story in a straiphtfor
ivard and connected manner, and his ac
curacy as to dates and incidents gives
credence to his statement that the coun
try beyond and in the south of Peking is
still in a dangerous state of unrest. Pai-

ince, is said to be procticallv the center
.of the trouble now. The refugee's report

the general secretary of the Amalgamated
Society of Railway Servants. The out
come, therefore, is one XJberal and one

At Derby the Liberals had .a. striking
success, recovering there the two seats
wrested in the general. election of 1SS5.
Altogether the Liberals have gained ten
seats 'and the Conservatives seven. Only
one Conservative seat was gained yester
day, but it was a very complete victory.

Industrial constituency held for ten years
by the late Anthony J. Mundella. who

On the whole the indications this morn-

change in the complexion of the new Par

the 2S7 candidates returned the relative
strength of parties is:

WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.â Rear Admiral
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment, may be able to supply the navy
with a wireless telegraph scheme without
asking Congress for a special appropria
tion for signals. The question which nec
essarily affects the determination of the
matter is that of expense. The depart
ment has learned that the British navy
recently equipped thirty-two of its men
of-war with the Marconi system for $1000
each, or a total of $32,000.
This Government is willing: to pay the
same price for the Instruments, but dur
ing Its negotiations with Mr. Marconi last
winter he wanted a payment of $10,000 for
each set of instruments and $10,000 per
year royalty. This was altogether too
great a sum for the department's purse
and it declined to. buy any of the instru
ments. Admiral Bradford, is anxious to
equip all the ships of the navy with the
system as rapidly as possible, as other
services are utilizing the invention, and
he does not want the American navy to
bo placed at a disadvantage.

child and he bestowed on the former nug

Mrs. Carmack last saw her husband in
April last, when she and her child ac
companied him to the depot. She expected
that she was to go with him on his jour
ney, but as the train pulled out Carmack
grasped her hand, shook it, jumned on one
of the cars and was gone. She
returned to her home vowing' vengeance
and at once took steps which have re
sulted in the* suit for divorce. This Indian
woman, brought up in the wilds of the
far North, soon showed that she had been
an apt pupil in studying tne ways of civ
ilization. Counsel was engaged and the
whereabouts of the millionaire traced. At
Seattle, it is alleged, certain things were
learned which form the groundwork jt
the allegations in the complaint.
HOLLISTER, Oct. 3.â George Car
mack, the discoverer of the
Klondike, will vigorously con
test the suit instituted by his In
dian wife for a divorce. The rea
son for his determination to fight the cas-s
Is that Mrs. Carmack demands a division
of his property, which is valued at a mil
lion and a half dollar. The case bids fair
to become one of the most noted that
has ever been tried Jn the courts of this
county. A Us pendens has been placed on
all of the millionaire's property here.
The clean-up from Carmack's Dawson
mines this year aggregated $240,000. The
two Indians whom he mentions as hav
ing led the way to the gold fields were
brothers of his wife.
"The first year we did not take out
very much and sold one claim for $13,500.
Pete McDonalfl purchased 230 feet and
Jack Felix and the Edgar brothers 250
fpet and are profiting by their Investment.
The second winter my partners and my
self worked our claims and took out about
$125,000." '
"We then went down to Forty-Mile for
provisions and tools to work^our claims.

stickpins. Carmack's story of his dis
covery of the Klondike as toid by him
self recently is as follows:
. "In the spring of '86 I went back on the
Yukon, trading and prospecting, until the
fall of 'S?. I remained for three^summers
in the vicinity of the Forty-Mile district
and then went to the Pelly River district
and was principally tnsaged In trading.
In the spring of "05 1 went down the
mouth of the Klondike to fish and then
started on a prospecting tour. I was ac
companied by two Thkweesh Indians. On
the 16th of August I made the big dis
covery on Boiinrza. I was going to a lit
tle creek called Gold Bottom to prospect
and on my way stumbled across thi.*
creek. It was cn high river bedrock and
the gold could be seen lying in the gold
rock. I staked out a claim of 500 feet by
right of discovery and 500 feet by right of
location. My two Indian companions also
staked out 500 feet each.

It Is supposed that Glenn set flre to
the buildings in order to watch them
burn. He was always one of the first to
.reach a conflagration and gazed eagerly
at the flames. He hateu Chinamen and

REDDING, Oct. 3. â The Republicans of
Redding gave Hon. Frank LÂ». Coombs,
candidate for Congress In the First Dis
trict, a splendid ovation to-night. A
brass band was brought, up from Red
Bluff and fireworks were burned on the
way to the hall. , Mr. Coombs was greeted
by*a fine audience and made an excellent
Impression. Â¦
Young Glenn was not satisfied -with hav
ing destroyed the building. On the night
after it had been torn down he set tire
to the heap of remnants and was seen
applying the match. The little fellow was
not arrested on the spot, the officers de
siring to obtain more evidence.
On the following night two barns were
destroyed, one of which contained a num
ber of hogs and one horse. The animals
were incinerated. The last structure
which the youngster set fire to was a cot
tage and it was partly destroyed. By
this time sufficient evidence had been ob
tained and Constable Irvine concluded to
take* Glenn Into custody lest he should
destroy more property. Before he had
been detected setting flre to the dance
hall he had* burned a row of Chinese
houses belonging to the Pacific Improve
ment Company.
The youthful prisoner cried bitterly
when brought to the jail and placed la
the cell formerly occupied by the boy
poisoner, Fred Himes. He refused to talk
about his case, though he had previously
made a number of statements to the offi
cers.' His stories weie conflicting and
when the contradictions were pointed out
to him he wept and declared he did not
know better. His father accompanied him
to the jail and seemed heartbroken over
the little fellow's predicament.
In one of the statements to the officers
the prisoner declared that he was not to
blame for setting fire to the buildings.
In the meantime more fires occurred, all
of them attended by suspicious circum
stances. Finally the town dance hall was
fired and partly burned. The following
night the torch was again applied and th3
building further damaged. For six suc
cessive nights the dance hall kept trying
to burn and finally it was reduced to a
pile of debris and was torn down.
About fourteen days ago a fire occurred
at Sanger, the circumstances strongly In
dicating incendiarism. Constable Irvine
began an investigation, but could not dls
cover the firebug. He kept a number of
suspicious characters under surveillance,
but never suspected the real culprit.
FRESNO, Oct. 3.â Harry Glenn, an
eleven-year-old boy, was brought to the
County Jail to-day by Constable Irvine
of Sanger and Incarcerated on a charge
of arson. The youth Is almost as much
of a monstrosity in the criminal line as
was Fred Himes. who was recently tried
here for having poisoned his father.
Young Glenn Is charged with having set
fire to no less than twelve buildings with
in the last two weeks and the proof
against him is overwhelming.

There was no such thing as imperialism,

supporting the retrogressive policy of the

the Governor said that it had been the

County Central Committee and one of the
most prominent Democrats in the city, of
trying to create dissension in the Demo

DEMANDS REGISTERED
AGAINST ST. MARY'S FUND
Finance Committee Denies Petition
to Establish an Emergency Hos
pital in the Park.
Cyril Williams, expert of the Finance
Committee, filed a report yesterday with
the Board of Supervisors, In which he
states that the amount of demands regis
tered In the City Treasurer's office is ?101,
21S. The demands outstanding and un
paid to June SO, 1900, as per the Auditor's
books, amount to $103,968 S6, the difference
being accounted for by unregistered de
mands. The only money on hand to pay
these demands is the St. Mary's Park
fund of $123,000 which Is held Intact by
Treasurer Hrooks until the decision of the
Supreme Court Is rendered on an appeal
from Superior Court decisions that the
fund may be used to pay other demands
against the city. Should the money be
made available to pay the * registered de
mands there will be a surplus of over $20,
(XK) in the city funds of. the last fiscal year.
The Finance Committee reported against
the petition of the Point Lobos Improve
ment Club requesting that an emergency
hospital be placed In Golden Gate Park,
because there are no funds available for
the purpose.
thirteen days after the firm was authorized
to do the work. The work waÂ» given to the
firm without competition, thereby violating a
provision of the charter.
In conclusion I would recommend that the
Board of Publtr Works be requested hereafter
to comply Ftrictiy with the charter provisions
in the awarding: of contracts, an.l that the
Hoard of Supervisors does not Indorse Its
course In performing an act first and R?ttln&
permission afterward.
The Board of Public Works has directed
Secretary Park to advertise for proposals
to reconstruct the stone curbs and basalt
block pavement on Fourth street, between
Harrison and Howard, except that por
tion required to be kept In order by the
street railway company. Proposals are
also to be invited for the construction of
an earth till and a concrete and brick cul
vert at the crossing of Nineteenth avenue
and Trocadero gulch, including the mac
adamizing of the. roadway and sidewalks
of Nineteenth nvenue. Tho board award
ed the contract for laying bitumlnus pave
ment in the court yard of the Hall of
Justice to Flynn & Treacy for 10 7-8c per
square foot.
Architect Mooser states that the thea
ters and other public buildings will be
unable to comply with the provisions of
a proposed ordinance requiring the instal
lation of automatic sprinklers as a tire
precaution. The Spring Valley Water
Company will decline to place five-Inch
mains in the buildings, and to be suc
cessfully operated the sprinklers must
connect with mains of that size. The
company win continue to supply two-Inch
mains in all buildings.
Will Appoint Four More Teachers Regard
less of Chronological Order.,
The Hoard of Edurition has decided to
establish four additional classes In schools
which are overcrowded. Resolutions will
bo adopted at next Wednesday's meeting
assigning MisÂ« A. E. Sutherland to tho
Haight Primary and Miss M. II. Slavan to
the Iiuena Vista Primary School. Two
ether classes will be established in the
Everett and South End schools, but
Chairman Mark t=ays that the teachers
have not yÂ«?t been selected. Notwithstand
ing- the boar.Vs announced Intention to
adhere to the priority cf service plan Jn

a comparison of the following official eli

Miss V. Casaidj August 11. I8Â»i
Miss L. Smlthson September 8,
It will be observed, that Miss Harrl
gan's original appointment antedates thai
of Miss Slavan and Miss Cooper's and
Miss Little's that of Miss Sutherland.
When asked as to this palpable evasion
of the chronological order Mark took re
fuge bahind the resolution adopted by tha
board at its last meeting, in which ad
verse reports riled by principals are hold
to be sufficient cause fur violation of the
only just method of promoting teachers.
Mark then said that the reason why Mrs.
Cooper hud been overlooked was because
of her advanced age and that Mrs. Har
rigan was not selected because her prin
cipal had filed charges against her which
consisted mainly of alleged lack of disci
pline.
Superintendent Webster said yesterday
that every teacher who Is ignored In tho
matter of chronological order has cause
for legal action against the board. The
decision of Judge Hunt, who reinstated
K. H. Mitchell as a teacher in the Low
ell High School, makes the point that a
teacher cannot be dismissed by the aboli
tion of a position which Is recreated and
another teacher assifjne-d to it whoc-e
election to the department was subsequent
to that of the displaced teacher.
Chairman Mark says that plans are be-
Iiir formulate! by the board for the In
auguration of tho civil service system In
the election of new teachers. It is in
tended to subject them to an examination
in all elementary subjects. They will then
be elected In the department according
to their standing.
- "It Is our intention," says Mark rlalvely.
"to eliminate every possibility of politi
cal or personal influence in the election of
teachers."
Mark also expresses himself in favor
of the movement, on the part of Superin
tendent Webster to enforce the compul
sory education law. While he says the
law in its present state is inoperative he
believes that tho appointment of compe
tent attendance ofllcers may do much to
Insure the sending of a larpe percentage
of the 19,000 children who do not attend
any school.

Shutting Out Professionalism.
Special Dispatch to The Call
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 3.â
The faculty athletic committee Is mak
ing sure that no taint of professionalism
shall creep Into athletics at Stanford. A
letter from the chairman, G. M. Richard
son, has been received by Manager Glld
ersleeve, forbidding the privilege of the
training table to any player who has not
paid his board for a week In advance.
Should any member of the squad fail to
live up to the rule his name will Immedi
ately be dropped from the list of eligible
candidates. This Is the first time any
such rule was enforced In a "Western col
lege. â¢ .-AZiSP, '''-V---~
Iowa 10, Philadelphia 2.
THE baseball team of the battle
ship Iowa turned its battery yes
terday afternoon full upon the
Philadelphia nine and shattered
it to pieces. After two hours of
close range fighting the nine able seamen
of the cruiser were pent below to the sur
geon. They were filled full of holes, all
their gloved armor, breastplates and
masks availing naught against the big
gun fire from the battleship tars. The
Iowa team Is now champion of the Pacific
squadron.
It was an uneven contest from the fir-
Ing of the first gun. just such a struggle
as comos out of a meeting between a bat
tleship and a cruippr. "Fireman" Smith,
who was In the box for the "Phlllios."
liPtPd his curves too much to port or star
board Â«nd repeatedly sent the Iowas to
the hags on four balls. Then again the
Iowa team proved impregnable to the hot
shot of the "Phillies' " guns. At the out
set of the game Iowa's men steamed
around the bags four times without any
return damage. In the fourth inning
Cox, the centerfielder of the cruiser, shot
a hot liner to the windward of Oelgprer,
second baseman for the Iowas, and made
two bases before the leather ammunition
landed. Poor infield marksmanship gave
him a run.
The "jackios" from the Philadelphia
lined up four deep In the "beer cage"
made a Hobson of Cox then and thore.
Next time he came to the bat he was
toasted In foaming yellow, but the dia
mond deck was slippery in spots and Cox
could not reach a safe place before he
was put out of the fight.
In the sixth inning Philadelphia was hit
by a hurricane jot runs. Before getting
to leeward the scorer rang four bells and
all retired to give the Iov/a band a chance
to play "You're up against the real thing
now."
Just before the Philadelphia sank there
was some heroic work done midships. A
single "Philly" crossed the plate, making
the score read 10-2.
This is the way the teams lined up:

payment of $350,000 were made by the deceased, and without the
sale of the realty their payment will be impossible. The ex
penses of administration. It is asserted, will amount to $125,000.
Persona, property valued at $140,000 still remains in the hands of
the petitioners, however, but it is not deemed advisable at this
time to dispose of the same for the Immediate needs of the
estate.
The property which the petitioners seek leave to sell is lo
cated in this city, San Mateo, Lake and Napa counties. Four
teen blocks in this city are incumbered by mortgage. This prop
erty, the petitioners say. will sell better than the rest. A valu
ation is placed by the petitioners upon many pieces of the
realty. The baths are scheduled at $211,150, ocean beach prop
erty at $74,500. Cliff House ranch JSS.560, San Miguel rancho
SSOS.lTo, outside lands $490,110, the heights at Slla.715 and "Arca
dia." which Is on the boundary line between Lake and Napa
counties, at $4571. No valuation is placed on the many other
holdings. Their value will be determined when the hammer of
the auctioneer or the bids received at private sale mark the
offering of the highest figures.
Judge Coffey has set the petition for. hearing on November
5. On that date evidence will be taken in support of the con
tention of the -petitioners that the sale is necessary An order
of court will follow. :..,
I? a petition filed yesterday by Emma L. Merrltt and W. R.
H. Adamson. executrix and executor of the wilj of the late
Adolph Sutro, Is granted by Judge Coffey the vast holdings
of the dead millionaire will pas3 under the auctioneer's
hammer before the new year. If Judge Coffey agrees with
the executrix and executor that the best Interests of the heirs
and devisees and the estate Itself will be subserved by the sale
of all the realty It will go down In the annals as the largest in
dividual sale held In this city since Its founding. Millions will
pour into the bank vaults of the estate, and in coi.sideration for
this gold the immense tracts of land that the dead financier
struggled so hard in life to keep Intact will be parceled out
among the seekers of homes and speculators.
In the petition filed by Mrs. Merritt and W. R. H. Adamson
they set forth In detail the lncumbrances that threaten to
wrest the most valuable portion of the realty from their hands
to the great loss of heirs and devisees. The estate at present.
It is set forth. Is indebted in the sum of $530,000, while the an
nual Income is only $62,0<X>-an amount insufficient to pay the
accumulating interest and make much headway toward the
payment of the principal. The Hibernla Savings and Loan So
ciety holds notes and mortgages against the property amount
ing to $476,950. The Nevada Bank still holds a claim against the
estate for $29,ST3 23, and there are outstanding other claims

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROCKLIX, Oct. 3.â Russell Landis. age.l
20 years, who has lived ht/e all his life.
to-night killed his wife nd mortally
wounded W. J. Clydesdale, the Constable
of this township. The tragedy was the
result of a family quarrel. Following hH
crime the murderer escaped, surrendered
and was lodged in prison at Auburn.
About ten years ago Landis married a
daughter of Mrs. Fisher of this place.
After a few years they became estranged.
Landis left here, but returned occasion
ally, stopping a few days at a time and
r.ever at his wife's house. It was re
ported recently that Mrs. Landis intended
to begin an action for divorce. They had
one child, a little girl 8 years of age. and
Landis was very mucn attached to her.
Landis returned to Rocklin about a
month ago and" has been working arouni
at various jobs, part of the time with
Clydesdale. The Constable has been a
good friend of both Landis and his wife
and has assisted them considerably and
he has been freely criticised as the cause,
of their estrangement. f
After dark this evening Landis bought
a box of loaded shells and. procuring a
double-barreied shotgun, went to his
wife's house. She had retired and came
to the door in her nightdress. He told
her he had come after his child. She
started to run to her mother's house close
by. when he fired at her with both bar
rels. The double charge struck Mrs. Lan
dis in the back of the head, blowing off
the top of her head.
Landjs then coolly went down to the
business part of town, got several drinks
and walked to Constable Clydesdale's
house. Clydesdale was in bed, reading.
Lnndls walked into the room and fired at
him with both barrels of his shotgun, the
charges lodging In the abdomen Just above
the grcin. He then walked back uptown
and took another drink, declaring boast
ingly: ;'; . -S'.'^iM
"I got them both and made a good Job."
He surrendered himself, and Sheriff
Keenan. who soon arrived, took him to
Auburn and placed him In the county Jail.
Clydesdale Is still alive, but his recov

PRESBYTERIAN
ANNUAL SYNOD
TO CONVENE
A peculiarly sad case was brought to
the attention of the police yesterday
morning and steps were at once taken to
help Mrs. Frank J. Curran, 416 Ivy ave
nue, who is the sufferer.
She and her husband quarreled about a
month ago and he left her. Two weeks
later her daughter Mabel ran away, so
Mrs. Curran says, with John McGreavy to
Sacramento. She has not seen her daugh
ter, since and does not know whether she
Is married or not.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Curran was
notified that the body of a man resemb
ling that of her husband had been found
among some bushes in a canyon near
Santa Rosa. A hunter had shot a squir
rel, which fell among the bushes wnere
the body lay and led to its discovery. The
distracted woman was anxious to leave
for Santa Rosa to see if her worst fears
would be realized, but before going she
wanted her two boys cared for.
Policeman Boyd was sent by Chief Sul
livan with her to the house and he took
the two boys â Frank. 15 years of asre. and
Harry. 13 years of ageâ to the Youths'
Directory, where they will be properly
looked after.
Mrs. C-rran was almost insane with
grief yesterday morninp. and it is fearej
ihat If she finds the body of the man Â»t
Santa Rosa to be that of her husband she
will commit suicide. Her daughter's con
duct has alao affected her deeply.

HAS AGAIN TRIED HIS LUCK AND ASTONISHED HIS FRIENDS.

ABOUT a week ago Ignaclo Martin
etti. comedian of the "Million
Dollars" company, the forth
coming New York production, was
quietly married to a Miss Marie
Ratcliffe, also a professional, and who Is
at present with a Philadelphia stock
company.
Following the time-honored custom of
the profession, the marriage was made a
"dark secret," and it only got out through
being confided to particular friends with
stringent orders to let It go no further.
James Hackett. Mary Mannering, Isabel
Irving and any amount of other well
known playerfoik made a secret of their
marriages for a long time, and so Mar
tinettl was not doing anything out of the
way in not making his public. Even now
he is said to be coy on the subject, and
when questioned will "say nothing but
this, 'tis so.' "
Xo where will the .news of the clever
comedian's marriage excite more Interest
than here, where he Is well known In
club and theatrical circles. As a member
of the Bohemian Club he was exceedingly
popular with every one with whom he
came in contact.
It was as the creator of Zou-Zou. the
erratic guardsman of "Trilby," that Mar
tinptti made the hit that gave him a place
In the front rank of the eccentric farce
comedians.
Martlnetti has also been a feature with
May Irwln. in whose support he scored
several creditable successes, his parts be
insr especially written for him. â¢
The actor is a native of this city, his
parents fcelnp prominent residents of the
French colony. This Is his second matri
monial venture.
Miss RatclifT 0 , though not known on
this coast, is a clever youn? actress and
a very beautiful Â¦ -oman. She has played
several Important engagements in Eastern
Cities.

Call.
(Marysville Democrat.)
WILL NOT SUPPORT
BAD MEN FOR OFFICE
The selection of the right man for the position will
be of immense benefit to the business interests not
only of the.city and the State but of the whole coun
try. That much is understood by the people at large,
and there will be general approval if such a man be
selected.
Before making the appointment to the position the
President will await recommendations from the city
and the State. The Senators from California will have
a potent influence in determining his choice. Upon
them, therefore, rests at this time a serious respon
sibility to the public. They should carefully consider
the subject in all its bearings and agree upon some
man who has had sufficient experience in business to
enable him to enter at once upon the duties of the
office with a clear understanding of their nature. It
will not be difficult fcr them to find such an official,
for the business world of California is not lacking in
able, energetic and honest men.
As no such inscription is there, the number of poli
ticians who are seeking the office is large. Some of
them are utterly unworthy of the office, or indeed of
any responsible office, while many are meritorious
gentlemen in many ways, but their merits are not of
the kind that commend them for this particular office.
Consequently, no matter how many recommendations
they may bring, or how much in the way of political
service they may prove, none of them should be se
riously considered for the place. It is a business office,
charged with the supervision of the interests of busi
ness men, and none but a business man should be as
signed to it.
jpij OR the right performance of the duties of the
I Collector of the Port of San Francisco there is
needed the abilities and the experience of a first
rate man of business. None other can even fully un
derstand the complex questions that arise in the office,
much less solve them with accuracy and promptness.
Accordingly upon the doors of that office there might
well be inscribed, "No politician need apply."

CAI/LFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.-Ulysses S.
In any effort made to promote either the pure food
or the forest protection laws the Grange would find
itself amply supported by public opinion and by the
press. The people arc now quite ready to act upon
the issues. Any well devised legislation will find a
warm approval everywhere. It is recognized that food
supervision, at any rate, cannot be effectually dealt
with by the States acting separately. The evil is na
tional and can be remedied only by national authority.
All of these things, we repeat, are well known. The
only reason why there has been no sufficient legisla
tion to prevent them is that Congress has never been
sufficiently impressed by the public demand for such
legislation. There is always a great pressure of busi
ness at the national capital, and Congressmen natur
ally act upon that which is most strenuously urged.
If the Grange will direct its energies to the task of
forcing the issues of pure food and forest protection
upon the attention of the Government we shall not be
long without getting the desired legislation. In fact,
a good deal has been already accomplished in the di
rection of pure food tews. A Senate committee has
collected a large amount of evidence upon the sub
ject and there is a strong sentiment in both houses in
favor of a national law of some kind to prevent frauds.
Therefore if the work of the Grange be resolutely un
dertaken at once and supported in all parts of the
country, we may have an experiment at least in pure
food legislation this winter.
The evil results of a lack of adequate laws against
the sale of spurious foods are many. The toleration
of what is no better than a swindling practice in
jures not only the consumer, who is deceived, but the
honest producer or manufacturer of genuine articles.
In that way legitimate industry is made the victim of
fraud. Producers of olive oil have to compete in a
market where cottonseed oil is sold under the name of
olive oil, and the products of our orchards are dis
credited by the practice of selling in the East all kinds
of inferior fruit labeled in such a way as to delude
the purchaser into the belief that they are the products
of California.
Upon neither of these issues is it necessary for the
Grange to undertake any elaborate campaign of edu
cation. It is safe to say that every American who is at
all interested in such subjects is already familiar with
the essential facts relating to them. It is known that
all sorts of impure foods are put upon the market
bearing labels which deceive the purchaser. It is also
known that our forests are being rapidly wasted while
almost nothing is done to repair the waste or even
to check it.
r\ MOXG the recommendations made to the
l^\ State Grange. at its meeting in Los Gatos on
Tuesday by State Master Worthen are two
which are of so much importance as to deserve the
most earnest efforts the Grange can put forth to pro
mote them. These are the enactment of legislation
for the preservation of forests and for the protection
of the public against the manufacture and sale of
adulterated and spurious articles of any kind, and
particularly those which are used for food or medi
cine.

za.tion' 1 ' salaries. This would probably be a good use
to which to put the money, since if the Phelanites get

plosion iiroold take place which would shake the
foundations of the civilized world. So if the taxpay

the'way â were able to comprehend the extent to
which they are annually fleeced by their political ser
vants they would fill the City Hall with smoke, com
pared With which the article wheeled out of the gas
house by the newly arrived Irishman would be as a
cigar puff to a Farallon fopbank.
One instance of the taxation bunko game may be
piven â not for the purpose of setting the taxpayers
of the city by the car's, but by way of public instruc
tion.
The new charter, as is well known (section 3, chap
ter 1, zrticie III), introduces into municipal economy
a new-fangled thing called a "budget." Annually, be
l'.veen the first Mondays in May and June, the Super
visors are required to meet and make up a '"budget"
.of- the amounts estimated as necessary to carry on the
government during the ensuing year. The amounts
>o : fixed become in each department the basis of ex
penditure for twelve months, and no official is per
mitted under any circumstances to exceed them;
indeed, if the Auditor or Treasurer in any one month
pay -demands in excess of one-twelfth of the amounts
sc-- fixed he is liable on his bonds. Thus the
.'"budget" is. the sheet anchor, as it were, of municipal
financeâ^the beginning and the end of tax-eating in
all its' forms.
Â¦ But -see how this device for protecting the tax
payers against the raid? of the tax-eaters works when
placed in the hands of the Phelanites at the City Hail.
' .In June the Supervisors met, adopted a "budget"
jand levied a tax of $1,127 on each $100 of valuation,
Â¦pjacrng; the assessment roll at $375,000,000. Subse
quently Assessor Dodge "discovered'^ that he had
â¢underestimated the total assessment to be returned by
him, and after the "budget" had been adopted and the
.levy" fixed it was found that the tax of $1,127 would
fall upon a roll amounting to $410,000,000 instead of
upon a roll amounting to $375,000,000. This additional
valuation takes from the taxpayers $393,625 more than
â¢vvas figured on, which includes the levy for sewer and

MEXICAN CLIMATE-J. M., City. The
differences of climate in the republic of
Mexico depend on the different degrees of

that "an olographic will Is one entirely

State and need not be witnessed." It has
been held that, such a will written on a

were words on the paper not in the hand

EMPLOYER AND EMPLOTE-L. W
L... City. The law of California holds a
negligent or careless employe responsible
for any damage resulting to his employer
by reason of neplect or carelessness, but
is silent as to the responsibility of the
employe, if any, as to accidental damage
to machinery, tools or property of the em
ployer. If when an employe is discharged

as to the amount of waj?es tendered the
employe can take the amount offered In

While it is regrettable, it is natural that there should
be a culmination of scandal to the course which John
C. Lynch has pursued. The office over which he
theoretically presides is one of the most important in
the Federal service. It has been a nest of disgrace
and crime. Its proper management demands the most
scrupulous honesty and the most rigid, untiring at
tention. Vast sums of money pass through it every
month. There is opportunity for fraud and dishon
est}'. Yet John C. Lynch has* delegated his important
stewardship to subordinates that he might dance ser
vile attendance upon lailroad manipulators and the
creatures which they have spewed into the political
life of California. Tt is natural that the expected
should have happened. Collector John C. Lynch has
been arraigned for gross neglect in the conduct of
his office. He is charged with vicious carelessness,
unbusinesslike methods and lapses which the most
charitably inclined insist are at least mysterious. His
course as Collector of Internal Revenue should serve
as a warning.
He has attached himself to the political bureau of
the Southern Pacific Company and shamelessly has
been active and offensive in promoting its interference
in the political affairs of California. He has deserted
his ofrice to become the tool and subservient agent
of the railroad and criminal bosses at Sacramento and
at State conventions. By implication he has made
the national administration wink at his delinquencies
as a public officer and indorse, by tolerance, his offen
sive participation in affairs not his own. He has allied
himself to men who are politically disreputable and is
better known as the truckling henchman of a discred
ited boss than as a Federal officer occupying a posi
tion of the most serious responsibility under the Gov
ernment.
It is perhaps not surprising that the official conduct
of John C. Lynch should throw discredit upon the
Republican party and jeopardize its success. This
man hjis neglected his duties so notoriously that he
has created widespread discussion in official circles,
â¢^s a legislator he was the dispenser of the favors of
the Southern Pacific Company, whose peculiar inter
ests in State legislation received his critical care and
protection. As a Collector of Internal Revenue he
has absented himself fromYhis office, delegating to
subordinates the duties which he is paid by the Fed
eral Government to perform. -
I OHNC. LYNCH, Collector of Internal Rev
ry\ enue, should be an object lesson and a warning
to men who occupy positions of public trust and
responsibility. At a time when the national adminis
tration is on trial before the voters of the State, when
interests of the most vital character to the Repub
lican party are at stake, his affairs, as a Federal officer
who reflects the national administration of which he
is a member, have become involved in a scandal and
are made the theme of public condemnation.

HORACE G. PLATT, DEMOCRAT, FAVORS
PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S RE-ELECTION
Will Not Vote for Bryan, as He Considers it
Unwise to Endanger the Country's* .. \
Prosperous Condition.-
EDITOR San Francisco Call:
I have been a Democrat all my
life, but I could not vote for
Bryan at the last election for
reasons that were then apparent to all
gold Democrats. These reasons still
exist, and there are other reasons that
influence me. I do not think that it
would be wise for the United States to
change its present foreign policy. Mr.
Bryan says he will change it in the event
of his election. I do not think that it
would be wise to Have the business of
the United States disturbed by fear of a
repeal of the currency law which was
recently adopted. Mr. Bryan would en
deavor to change it and to reopen the
16 to 1 question. Such is . his avowed
purpose. Mr. Bryan would place in
power men who are his most sympa
thetic advisers. These men are all
strongly intent upon making a change
in our financial and foreign policies,
and many of them are in sympathy with
the socialistic and revolutionary ele
ments of society.
In other words, I think that the ad
ministration of our 'national affairs
during the past four years has left the
United States in such a prosperous con
dition that it would be unwise to place
in power any set of men or party that
would make a radical change in the
present financial and political policy of
In his pretense of reverence for the teachings of
Lincoln Bryan is as great a sham as when he pre
tended a like reverence for Jefferson and Jackson.
We challenge him to read Lincoln on the banks and
then continue his ambuscade behind Lincoln's fame.
The national banking system, instead of being .de
stroyed, should be advanced to meet the greater needs
of our larger business and population and to protect
labor against a vicious currency.
The legal tender act, authorizing the issue of the
national greenback currency, was passed the preced
ing February. In the message referred to Mr. Lin
coln said: "A return to specie payments, however, at
the earliest period compatible with due regard to all
interests, should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations
ii; the value of currency are always injurious, and to
reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point
v.il! always be a leading purpose in wise legislation.
Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility,
into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best an 1
srtrest safeguard r.gainst them, and it is extremely
doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes
payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of
the people can be permanently, usefully and safely
maintained. Is there, then, any other mode by which
the necessary provision for the public wants can be
made and the great advantage of a safe and uniform
currency secured?
"I know of none which promises so certain results
and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the or
ganization of banking associations, under a general
act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To
such associations the Government might furnish cir
culating notes, on the security of United States bond?
deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared
under the supervision of proper officers, being uni
form in appearance and security, and convertible al
ways into coin, would at once protect labor against
the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce
by cheap and safe exchanges."
What Lincoln recommended Bryan announces his
purpose to destroy.
We would like for him to quote from Lincoln's
second regular message, delivered to Congress on the
first Monday in December. 1862.
Colonel Bryan, while exhibiting himself as the
wenrer of Lincoln's mantle and the devoted apostle of
Lincoln's views, proposes this destruction of the na
tional banks and expulsion of all metal currency.
He does not stop to think â indeed he never
thinksâ that a return to the emission of greenbacks
will expel both gold and silver and throw the country
upon a fluctuating paper ba?is. The immediate effect
of the greenback issue in 1862 was to send all the gold
and silver out of the country. There was even no
small silver change left, and we were compelled to
resort to the forgotten postal currency, which was is
sued in denominations running from five up to fifty
cents. Our small silver coin all went over to Canada,
where there was such a plethora of it that the Cana
dians complained of too much change, while we had
none at all.
In his speeches and his letter of acceptance Colonel
Bfyan calls for a return to the unlimited issue of
greenbacks, or national currency, and the abolition of
national banks and destruction of that banking sys
tem. In this he agrees with the Populists, who first
nominated him, and with the greenbackers, who were
the fathers of the Populist movement.
As the States which are expected to give Colonel
Bryan 120 electoral votes' refuse self-government to
the negro and deny him the right to vote, the sole
means of self-government, that part of Lincoln's say
ing will not fit in with Colonel Bryan's interests.
Therefore he omits it.
Lincoln said: "A negro is a human being. To
deny him self-government is to destroy self-govern
ment."
Therefore the Colonel set out to conjure Republican
votes by telling on every stump that he represented
Lincoln Republicanism. To back this claim he pro
duced a lot of garbled quotations from Lincoln, ex
purgated so as to hit the Filipino and not include the
negro. These quotations he has declaimed all over
the North in the endeavor to woo Republicans from
their allegiance. In quoting Lincoln on consent of
the governed he omits the text of the sentence and
gives only the context.
/~* OLONEL BRYAN has lately let Jefferson and
( Jackson alone. He no longer misquotes thehi
on the money question. His attempt to trace
his crackleware notions back to those fathers of
Democracy had become rather ridiculous, in view of
their utter difference of opinion in regard to every
financial policy he has advocated.

Chief Engineer McCalg made a suitable
reply and then there was a general cele

ally lived as well as written. For if the
age was golden It was not merely because
there were a few great lights, but also be
cause there was a high ideal of life
and conduct, a love of learning and an
effort after the best. -
It was a time when the struggle for a
national existence was over, but the re
sponsibility of establishing a national life
remained; when puritanlsm had relaxed
its hold as a dogma, but the conscience
was still braced by its moral power; when
the pioneer's ax no longer rang in the
forest, but the chopping of firewood was
still a daily chore for Intellectual youth:
Â¦when the inward necessity to read and
think was scarcely less imperative than
the outward obligation to labor, and the
good housewife, after storing her pies In
the cupboard, opened her Plato and re
freshed herself at the storehouse of
Greek thought.
The conditions were almost unique in
history. There was something of the
Scotch background of religious austerity
and simplicity cf life: but the Scotch was
steeped in traditions; the New Englanders
had crossed the sea with no superfluous
baggage of this sort, and stood In a new
land, whose history was the history of
individuals, not of the race. Even the re
ligious austerity had softened and become
their one tradition. Dr. Channtng's elo
quence had commended freedom and
brotherly love, and Unltarianlsm, spoken
of somewhere by the pood doctor as only
the vestibule of tfie religion to come, was
for the nonce the national church. The
people were independent, but In one re
spect still colonial. English literature
was still a mother country for the mind.
as it always will be; they had no new
language in which to clothe their new
thought: they had not even, like Burns,
a dialect to be raised to the dignity of a
language. Their eye read of the lark and
the nightingale, while their ear listened
to the bobolink and the whip-poor-will.
On the one hand culture, on the other
freedom of thought.
The. former made Its home in Cam

Concord. There was no battle between

have unrolled before us the years of its

Isolated productions, unrelated to each

life of the country. Bryant alone of these
â¢writers survived to live side by side with
the croup who make up the literary period
called the Kolden age. In which our litera
ture became more compact and homo

country and having a certain unity of
purpose and Idea. To take the right
measure of this period It is not enough
to read the poems, romances and essays
which are its best legacy to us. We must
also dip into. biography to see under what
conditions these works were broueht

Every person suffering from catarrh- In â¢
its many forms knows that- tho common. Â¦
lotions, salves and douches do not cure.-. "
It Is needless to argue this point or to cite:
cases of failure, because every victim of .
catarrhal trouble knows It for himself If V
he has tried them. â¢ â¢ .
A local application, if it- does Anything '
at all, simply gives, temporary relief; a ,
wash, lotion, salve or powder cannot reach
the seat of the disease, which is the blood. Â¦ '
The mucous membrane seeks to relieve .
Â¦ the blood of catarrhal poison by secreting Â¦
large quantities of mucus, the discharge â¢
sometimes closing up the nostrils descend- - ;
ing to the throat and larynx, causing an
irritating cough, continual clearing of tne
throat, deafness, indigestion and many .
other, disagreeable and persistent symp- 'â¢â¢
torn?. â¢ â¢
A remedy to really cure catarrh must â¢
be an Internal treatment: a remedy which
will gradually cleanse the system from Â¦
catarrhal poison and remove the fever and
congestion always present in the mucous -
membrane.
The best remedies for this purpose are i
Eucalyptol. Sangulnaria and Hydrastin. r Â¦
but the difficulty has always been to get
these valuable curatives combined In one Â¦
palatable, convenient and efficient form.
Recently this has been accomplished Â¦ '
and the preparation put on the market '
under the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab- Â¦
lets. They are larsre. pleasant tastlnsr
loTenireJt so that they may be slowly dlsi- ." :
solved in the mouth, thus reaching every
part of the mucous membrane and finally Â¦
the stomach and Intestines.
An advantage to be considered also Is
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain no '.
cocaine, morphine or poisonous narcotics
bo often found In catarrh powders and the
use of which often entails a habit more
dangerous than the disease.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by â¢
drugrsrists at 50 cents, for full-steed pack-
age and are probably the.snfest and most
effectual catarrh cure on the market.

CHICAGO. Oct. 3. â "Wheat was as Inconstant
and fickle as a summer breeze, weak and strong
by fits and starts. Until near the end of the
session trading was of a local character, w\th
the scalpers on the verge of nervous prostration
from trying to keep en the right side. Liver
pool did not reflect the decline here yesterday
and the Northwest still had bad weather. With
these configurations to ?tart with November
opened HS\ic hipber at 77^i@77*ic. On lack of
ontFi'Ie sur-port the market dropped to 76%c.
Liverpool showed greater firmness later and
shorts took back earlier stuff, causing a rally
to 7?M;C. The market was not big enough to
Ftand th? profit-taking which met this bulge
and again weakness appeared, November drop
prin:: to 77'i,c At this point strong tajk of
cash business from th? Northwest, buying by
Interests of that section in this market and
indications that shipping business here would
soon pick up, caused a sharp rally near the end.
November Jumped rapidly to 77% c and closed
strong, %@%c over yesterday at 77\Â«t777<ic
Corn was moderately active and firm. The
market scored a good advance on buylne by
phorts. but lost lt on profit-taking. November
closed unchanged.
Oats continued dull. November closed Me
higher.
Buying by packers created a scare of shorts
and gave a strong provision market. Pork
closed 22Hc over yesterday: ribs 12Vic better
and lard closed 7 1 4Â«il0c higher.

BOSTON, Oct. 3.â The American ' Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: There
has been a decidedly better inquiry for wool
in the past week and the sales reached "a larger
aggregate than has been reported since the
week ending August 30, being over two million
and a quarter roii"" 8 - This improved demand
for wool is due not so much to any decidedly
favorable turn in the goods market as to the
fact that consumers in many Instances are
absolutely bare of wool and their stocks had
become bo seriously reduced that they were
really compelled to come Into the market and
take stock or close their mills. One healthy
feature of the' situation is that the improved
inquiry is not confined to a few houses, but
has bsen pretty generally shared by the whole
trade. Another feature of the business Is the
improved inquiry for fine wools, both unwashed
and washed, but mostly the latter, from man
ufacturers making a fine quality of - goods,
which Is in quite striking contrast to the de
mand which had previously prevailed, which
was - almost exclusively for medium and t low
goods. r Ti rVfl^T*H*11TTTffi|jii BifiiW fiBTBIfpIl H MTOji

annually diminishing-. There are on the en-
Raped coal list from Australia thirtv-seven ves

were 20,000 tons more tonnase chartered in Au

Washington coal and California oil. With no
marked shrinkage from these sources we shall
avoid any fuel famine; at the same tim<" thev
arÂ«Â» strained to meet the local demand. English
grades are gradually belnsr excluded from our

shipments. The crude oil output is increasing

displacing a few larsre coal burners. For the
moment this is welcomed temporarily even by
coal producers, as It Is aldlnc them to keep
buyers stocked up. Later on this may lead
to keen competition, but certainly not fiÂ»r a

a condition due to President McKInley's
fulfillment of the promises made to the
people by the Republican party in the

The speaker said that the increase of
trade and the general wave of prosperity
was not confined to any particular sec

the stagnant and depressed conditions
under which^ the people had been held
during the years of the previous national

To cite an example of this State's re

that Is the way to harmonize the party?
Those men on the purity committee were
appointed to purify Republican politics.
They will purify it into corruption. There
Is no precedent for their acting as a cam
paign committee."
Aschhelm's motion for a committee of
seven prevailed, and Chairman Hillman
appointed the following members to serve
on it:
I. J. Aschhelm. John F. McGlynn. E. M.
Buckley. L. D. McOonald. H. C. Hender
son. Frank D. Worth and Lenn Samuels.
The purity committee, which was organ
ized as a campaign committee and which
may dispute the authority of the men
namÂ«Â»d by Hillman. is composed of H. G.
W. Dtnkelsplel. A. B. Mahony. Patrick
Prendergast. Morris Asher and Thomas
W. Woodward.
The meeting adjourned without tran
sacting further business.
Augustus Tilden moved that It be the
sense of the meeting that the purity com
mittee be recognized as the regular cam
paign committee. A. B. Truman made the
point of order that the committee could
not appoint as a committee to represent it
men who did not belong to it. The point
was sustained by the chair.
Truman moved that a campaign com
mittee of eighteen be appointed, one from
each Assembly District, but the motion
was lost. I. J. Aschheim moved that the
chair appoint a committee of seven. Til
den and others? were still contending that
harmony would be promoted by recogniz
ing the purity committee as the campaign
committee. George Boyne opposed that
contention and was jeered at by some of
the Kelly men present.
Chairman Hillman, and soon got Into
such a snarl that for a time it looked as
if it would not be straightened out. The
complication arose over the fact that the
purity committee appointed by Chairman
Bergerot of the County Convention had
organized as a campaign committee.
Chairman Hillman said It was not de
sirable that there should be any conflict
of authority, but as these was grave doubt
of the-validity of the purity committee's
organization a3 a campaign committee it
would be expedient for the County Com
mittee to proceed as if such action had
not been taken until .the validity of it had
been settled.
"The indorsement is a very proper one."
A. Reuf said. "Mr. Spear's services to
the party have be*>n eminent. He is well
known as a citizen of high standing and
unquestioned integrity, and his appoint
ment would do honor to the party and
the city. It would be in the line of civil
service reform, being practically a prc
motion for Mr. Spear. His present ofllca
would be left vacant, to be filled by the
appointment of some oth^r worthy man."
The motion for the adoption of the reso
lution was put to vote without further
debate and was carried.
James A. Wilson resigned as secretary
of the county committee and John F. Mc-
Glynn was chosen as his successor. Al

President Makes Light of the Rumor
That There Is a Plot to Take
* His Life.
CAXTOX, Ohio, Oct. 3.â President Mc-
Kinley seemingly was not affected to-day
by the information of an alleged plot to
kill him. His movements were of wonted
order. He was closely watched, however,
and his house Is guarded to-night by de
tectives and secret service men.
It was not until this morning that the
President was told that a letter was in
the possession of the Secret Service De
partment giving information that three
men had determined to kill him. He was
inclined to treat the matter lightly, as hÂ»
has been told repeatedly of similar
threats.
The secret service men evidently con
sidered the letter of sufficient importance
to take precautions. The detail of secret
service men here was increased and local
policemen were told to watch for the
three men, whose description was given.
It is said here that the rirst information
received in Canton came to George Fos
ter, chief of the secret service detail for
the' President. His advices came from
Washington, it is asserted, and were to
the effect that an anonymous letter had
been received by the Secret Service De- !
partment at Chicago declaring that two
Italians and a supposed army officer, tali
and dark complexioned. had sworn to kill
the President on October 2. ;
Additional secret service men were hur
ried here and Mr. Foster communicated I
with Mayor Robertson, who Is also Chief
of the Canton police. Mr. Robertson or
dered a special detail of police to guard
the McKlnley home.
. All trains into and out of the city have
been carefully watched to-day. All quar
ters of the city where such strangers
might be harbored have been searched.
So far as known no trace of the men has
been found. The secret service men, as
sisted by the local police, are patrolling
the city to-night.

OAKLAND REAL ESTATE.RIVAL, CARMENS AT THE TIV
OLI AND THE CALIFORNIA
THEATER.
The varied bills of the two opera com
panies at the Tivoli Opera-house and Cal
ifornia Theater are creating much inter
est among the mujic lovers. "Traviata,"
so well given on Tuesday evening at the
California, will be repeated to-night, and
at the Tivoli the fine production of the
"Huguenots" will be given again. To
morrow evening "Faust" will be the bill
at both houses and on Saturday "Car
men" and the "Huguenots" at the Tivoli
and "Carmen" and "Trovatore" at the
California will be the bill.
Both women are fair to look upon and
easily hold the eye while they are upon
the stage by their physical beauty alone.
Tivoli Carmen's case. In the Spanish
dance, where the opportunity to out-Car
men Carmen occurs, it rather happens
that way with Miss Graham, a slight
overstepping of the limits of the inevit
able suggestion of the part. And the
voice, sweet and rich as it is, does notâ
again the Anglo-Saxonâ lend itself to the
emotional coloring of the moment. Â§he
has her moments of depth,- but the con
ception lacks the vivid, elemental energy
of the California's Carmen, and it Is sub
mitted that It Is an Inherent hemispheral
difference of temperament. {
saloons and dance houses that have for
years flourished in the district known as
the old Barbary Coast. We have received
strict orders to keep close watch on all
the drinking houses and dives that are
situated ln the district, and If any dis
turbance occurs we are expected to re
port it at once to the captain in charge
of that section of the city. If the pro
prietor fails to satisfactorily explain the
matter he is to be complained of to the
Police Commission and his license will be
promptly revoked."
The new Barbary Coast will be along
Pacific and Jackson streets, from Mason
to Sansome. The men who ask for li
censes to conduct saloons in the district
will be warned that the first case of rob
bery or any serious disturbance which
happens in their places will be sufficient
grounds for the Commissioners to revoke
their licenses. Furthermore, the new
Barbary Coast will be under constant po
lice surveillance. To-day every saloon
keeper along the lower end of Kearny
street will be notified that as soon as his
license expires he will have to move to
the new district Or get out of the busi
ness, i
Hereafter the saloon - keepers along
Kearny street, from Washington to Pa
cific, will be refused a renewal of their
licenses. Chief of Police Sullivan is de
termined to either force them out of
business or compel them to seek places
in the district to be known as the' new
Barbary Coast. Many of the saloon
keepers who are affected by the sweeping
order of the head of the department are
seriously thinking of taking the matter
into the courts. They argue that by
forcing them out of business the Chief
is depriving them of their means of
a livelihood. Notwithstanding their pro
testations and entreaties Sullivan firmly
declares that he will rid Kearny street
in the vicinity of the Hall of Justice of
saloons. He is particularly opposed to
the dance halls that flourish along the
street and will prevent the proprietors
receiving renewals of their licenses if he
can. More than fifty saloons and dance
halls will have to close unless the Chief
recedes from his present position.
One of Sullivan's subordinates, in speak
ing about the matter yesterday, said:
"The Chief is determined to close all

Poolsellers May Escape.
An appeal from the judgment of the
Police Court finding Harry Corbett. Wal
ter Mclnerney and John D alley guilty of
violating the anti-poolselling ordinance for
accepting a bet in this city and placing
the same in the San Jose poolrooms was
argued before Judges Lawlor and Cook
yesterday. After argument the court In

San Jose the local ordinance had not been
violated.. The District Attorney was
given an opportunity, however, to file

AlexÂ«nder C. Forsyth, at one time con
nected with the management of H. S.
Crocker & Co.. was made the defendant
in an action for divorce filed yesterday
by Josephine M. Forsyth. Mrs. Forsyth
makes many charges of cruelty against
her husband, in addition to the allega
tions that he is dissipated and willful in
his neglect of her.
Mrs. Forsyth, who resides at 1324 Ful
ton street, sayjs she married her husband
January 24, 1SS4. In February of this
year, she continues, he proceeded to
wreck the household furniture and con
cluded the episode by throwing a chair
at his wife's sister. â¢ In April last, it is
alleged, Forsyth knocked down a door
and threatened to kill his family. In
July, it is claimed, he took a kettle and
after breaking various articles of furni
ture with the same smashed it into frag
ments.
Mrs. Forsyth says her husband has 640
acres of land in Mendocino County, 640
acres Jn Kern County, property in Berke
ley and 100 shares of the capital stock of
the H. S. Crocker Company. She asks that
her husband be restrained from disposing
of this property until her rights have been
determined by the court. Forsyth was
served with the papers and will prepare
his defense.
Lena M. Pyle was granted a divorce
from George S. Pyle yesterday on the
ground of willful neglect. Isidor Sanger

Yesterday was the great day of the Jew
ish year." All the . synagogues were
thronged and services; were continuous
from early in the morning until the going
down of the sun marked the close of the
holiday. The business houses of all ortho
dox Jews were closed, and in the stricter
families neither meat nor drink passed
the lips of any one from sundown of Tues
day until sundown of yesterday.
In the synagogues the services were
most elaborate. The choirs had been aug
mented and in all special attention had
been given to make the musical portion
of the service as beautiful and Impressive
as possible. In the Temple Emanu-El on
Sutter street the organ was supplemented
by a stringed orchestra, including a harp,
on which was rendered one of the solos
during the day.
The services were divided into four
parts; the morning service, the additional
service, the afternoon service and the
concluding service. Included in these,
generally in the morning service, was a
memorial service in which the names of
the deceased relatives and friends of "the
members of the congregations and the
deceased members of the congregations,
were read from the altars and prayers
wei# offered for the pardon of their sins
and the repose of their souls.
In the Temple Emanu-El the subject of
Rabbi Voorsanger'-s principal sermon was
"A Historical Account of the Day of
Atonement." It was more than an ac
count of the origin of the day; it was an
analysis of its meaning and of the bless
ings which it carried to the truly penitent
and faithful.
In the Geary-street Temple Rabbi M. S
Levy spoke first on the story of the death
of David's child, and the deep significance
of David's words when he said he would
go unto the child since the child would
not return to him. In the afternoon Rabbi
Levy spoke on the subject, "The Day, Is
Waning; the Sun Is About to Set and the
Gates Are Still Open." He drew from his
subject the thought that, though time is
always short, still it is not too late to re
pent, and if the .gates of pardon are
sought they will not be found closed.
In the other synagogues sermons on sim
ilar appropriate subjects were delivered
the burden of them all being that by true
repentence only may atonement of sins
be found, and that God's mercy is infinite
and his forgiveness is awaiting all those
who earnestly and humbly seek it

Durphy was arrested in Eureka .last
Monday and the case is now pending in
the courts of that city. Mrs. Margaret
Durphy, the wife whom he left eighteen
years ago, is the prosecuting witness.

ises to stir things up generally and so do
all connected with the case. Durphy oc
cupies an unpleasant position, as both the
ladies now declare war on him. Eighteen
years of waiting has turned Margaret
Durphy's love to gall and she and Mrs.
Bates promise to put up a good claim to
the man who left home, made a fortune
and forgot to come home to spend it.
But Whitman's streets have never
since felt the Durphy tread, and hope
grew pale and died in the hearts of Dui
phy's relatives. Now comes the Eureka
arrest, and the charge of blackmail.
In about two weeks he came and went
to the house where his daughter was
staying. As she was not there he left a
note for her to call at the Grand Hotel.
They met there, and after persuading her
to keep silent Durphy sent her back to
Boston, promising soon to join her.
Reuben H. Lloyd, however, whom Mrs.
Bates had retained as her attorney, com
bated her acceptance of her father's In
vitation, knowing that he would return,
as his Interests are all located here.
In October Lucas informed Durphy's
daughter that her father had been found.
Mrs. Bates arrived in San Francisco a
month later. In the meantime Durphy
was flying eastward to meet her. When
he arrived at Boston he learned that they
had passed somewhere in the middle of
the continent, and wired to this city for
Mrs. Bates to return to Boston and he
would rejoin his family and explain
everything. â¢

that of course she was too young when
her mother was deserted to recollect
Durphy's appearance, but from things he
had mentioned and from events long dor
mant In ' the village memories which he
had recalled, she felt sure that Reedwood
was none other than Bradley Francis
Durphy. h^r father.
Soon after this interview a letter
reached Detective Lucas of San Fran

Eureka on complaint of a woman claim
ing to be his wife. Marparet E. Durphy of
Massachusetts, who alleged that he was
living with another wife without having
gone through the formality of securing a
dlvorc- from wife No. 1. Durphy denies
the charge, says he ha? an Oregon divorce
and hints Â¦Â£ blackmail. Back of the pend-
Ir.p proceedings !us a story of desertion
and concealed identity.
Kighteen years ago Bradley Frcvcls
Durphy was living with his wife and
daughter, a child of 5 years at Whit
man, a small village about eighteen
miles from Boston. Mass. One day Dur
phy left his home. He failed to return
and finally his wife gave up hope of locat
ing him and devoted herself to the care of
their little daughter. The girl grew up
and married a merchant of Whitman
named Bates and the young couple took
up their abode at the old Durphy home
stead.
About the middle of October. IS98, eight
een years after Durphy's disappearance,
.a stranger came to Whitman and after lo
cating the family residence announced
himself to Mrs. Bates as R. R. Reedwood
of San Francisco and a business partner
of Bradley Frar.cis Durphy. whose emis
sary to his family he represented himself
to be.
In glowing sunset tints Mr. Reedwood
painted an alluring picture of Durphy's
prosperity, wealth and general well being
and then jumped back B few years to the
day when the lattrr and himself had first
formed a business connection.
According to Reedwood he had met Dur
phy thirteen years ago. A business part

Re^dwood stated that a letter addressed

reach him, or that Durphy's mail would
be delivered if sent to the same address.
Unfortunately the very person to whom
Reedwood's visit would have been of most
Interest was not present- " Mrs. Durphy
was in Boston and Reedwood could not
wait, he said. Then he left Whitman.
Mrs. Durphy returned from Boston In
due course and then letters addressed to
Reedwood and Durphy began to arrive at
the Grand Hotel. In one of them was a
photograph of Mrs. Bates; Reedwood had
said Durphy wanted It and so the
daughter had one taken and sent it. But
neither the photo or the letters ever went
further than the Grand Hotel, and after
a time they were returned to the senders
