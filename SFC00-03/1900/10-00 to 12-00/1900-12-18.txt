, â : CASE : WITH THE . SUBMISSION OF ' THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH HE BASES HIS CLAIM.
Members of the mob came to Boon
ville in wagons, buggies and on horseback.
Their rigs were left In a grove a half
mile out cf town and the men marched In
columns of twos under the commands ot
three men who had evidently been select
ed as leaders.
Citizens of Boonville made no effort
to assist in the protection of the negro
and a number quietly admitted that the
citizens generally were In sympathy with
the work of the mob. Judge' Swan of the
Warwick County Circuit Court sought to
prevent violence, but the members of the
mob Ignored him and proceeded wJth the
work.
Xone of the mob wore a mask. . To all
appearances men of every station In life
took part In the lynching. Not a shot was
fired before or after the lynching, and ex
cept for the excited groups of men stand
ing on the street earners' a Btrange'r would
have known nothing of the tragedy that
had Just been enacted.-
Little time was used in breaking: into
the cell and very soon the thoroughly, ter
rified negro was In the hands of his ex
ecutioners, who placed a rope around his
neck. All left, crawling again through
the hole by which they had entered, drag
ging the negro after them.
A few minutes' time w"as consumed in
the march to the Jail yard, where the rope
was thrown over the limb of a tree and a
hvndred willing hands pulled the rope and
pent the negro's body flying into the air.
The loose end of the rope -was tied to a
tree and as soon as the members of the
mob were sure that their work had been
completed they left in as quiet a manner
as they had entered the town.
Ring plteously to be spared The men
Â¦working at the door of the cell might
have been deaf, Judging by the attention
they paid to the walling of the negro.
BOONVILLE. Ind.. Dec. 17.â John
Rolla. the third cf the colored men impli
cated in the murder of Hollie Simons, was
handed to a tree In the courthouse yard
by a mob of about 100 men from Rock
port at 6:30 o'clock this tvering. Not a
ehot was fired and everything Â¦was eon
ducted as quietly as if the execution had
beeo under the sanction of the law.
Rolla was brought to this place this aft
ernoon about 3 o'clock in charge of Sh*Â»rlfT
Anderson of Rockport. Upon his arrival
he was placed in a cell on the second floor
of the Jail and his presence was known
to only a few citizens.
A few minutes after 6 o'clock about
30!) men marched through 1 the principal
Ftreets of the city to the Jail and d*-njand
rd that the prisoner be turned over to
them.
Sheriff Hudson was out of town, and his
<3Â«Â»pi;ty, Raymond Cherry, was In charge
cf the Jail. He had heard that a mob was
en Its way here and at once made an ef
fort to get the prisoner out of town to
take him Jo Evansville, but before this
could be accomplished the mob had ar
rived and the futility of the attempt be
rr.mf apparent. He declined to give up
the kÂ«*yB of the Jail and the members of
the rr.ob at once began to batter in the
v.alis of the Jail with a telegraph pole,
â¢which was handled by a doeen or more
men. As soon as a hoiÂ© larg* enough to
admit the body of a man was battered
through the wall six members of the mob
crawled through with sledge hammers
and broke down the door of Roila's cell.
Inside the Jail tha negro coyld hear the
sourd** of the battering-ram as it pounded
-Sown the wall, and he lay upon the floor
ia his cell In an agpny of fear.
When the men reached his cell he pro
tested his innocenc* in loud tones, begr-

THE trial of the suit for libel in
stituted by Baron J. H. von
Schroeder against The Call has
commenced at San Rafael before
Superior Judge Angellotti and
a Jury. In this suit Baron von Schroe
der sues for 1250,000 damages for the
publication of an article which he
alleges defamed his character, injured
his business and blackened his. repu
tation. The article upon which Baron
von Schroeder bases his suit was pub
lished In The Call on October 25. lS99.jIn ,
obedience to Us duty as a protector Jof
publjc^morals'and the reputations of hon
est women, this paper published certain
facts in.thellf*? of Von. Schroeder. With
his private acts and conduct of dally life
this paper was not concerned until in his
actions and from his position he became
a menace to society. It then became the
duty of this paper to expose him. and this
was done. He now asks damages for that
expose.
In a variety of ways Von Schroeder had
made himself offensive to reputable guests
of the Hotel Rafael. His manner of life
had bred scandal at the hotel and had in
jured its good name to such a degree that
the lessee found his business interests se
riously In Jeopardy. Women against whosa
honor no breath of 'scandal had beem,
raised found themselves through the con
duct of Von Schroeder In an environment
which shocked them. In order that fur
ther injury to innocent people should not
be done .The Call published the facts. A
complete and most searching investiga
tion was made, and the facts. were mad*
public only after absolute verification.
Shortly after the publication Baron von
Schroeder Instituted proceedings before
the Grand Jury of Marln County, with a
view to holding the proprietor of this pa
per criminally responsible.. The facts were
presented under oath, testimony explain
ing the motive of The Call was submitted
and seventeen members of the jury voted
that the publication of Von Schroeder's de
linquencies, as a matter of public policy,
had been justified.
Baron von Schroeder then prepared to
prosecute his civil Bult -.' for damages
against The Call, tin presenting his case
yesterday he had no witnesses.', He had
been accused of offenses which. If true,
dishonor him In the opinion of decent
men, but he did not go upon the witness
stand in defense of his name. He had
been charged with conduct which, If he; is'
guilty, makes him an enemy to society,
against whom the hands of. honorable men
and honest women should be raised,' yet
he did not become a. witness arid' submit
himself to the cross-examination of his
accusers. He rested his case with the
presentation of the article In which he
claims his character was assailed.
The Call then began the submission of
the testimony which has been accumu
lated In defense. This evidence had re
lation yesterday to the manner in which
the article was prepared and to the motive
which prompted its publication. The facts
of verification were recited'and testimony
was submitted to prove that no element of
malice entered Into the purpose of The
Call to expose a man who had made him
self dangrerous to the community. The
trial will be resumed to-day f when further
evidence will be introduced to Justify the
publication of the article upon which Von
Schroeder bsres his suit, for libel.
Defendant's Answer.
Failing to' secure an indictment "of ; the
proprietor of The Call, for criminal libel.
Baron yon Schroeder began a civil action
against him. charging him with libel and
asking for $$jO,000, damages, alleging: that
his reputation and standing In the com
munity had suffered 'to that extent

only after repeated attempts that the
plucky sailor reached the shore and was
pulled up on to the rocks. Then some of
the crew and the Japanese passengers

two more lines were passed ashore.

Chandler Again Calls It to the Atten-
tion of the Senate.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 17.â The Montana
Senatorial case was brought to the atten
tion of the Senate to-day by an inquiry of
Chandler, chairman of the Committee on
Privilege* and Elections, as to whether
the Committee on Contingent Expenses
â¢was ready to report back the resolution
authorizing- the Committee on Privileges
*.r,Â«i Elections to send for persons and
papers in the investigation of the right of
W. A. Clark and Martin Maglnnis to a
seat in the Senate.
Oallinger of Xcw Hampshire explained
that no action had been taken by the com
mittee because of the absence of the
chairman. Jones of Nevada, and also of
Jones of Arkansas.
Chandler said he thought the Senate
had a right to an early report from the
Committee, and said he would to glad to
know what had influenced members of the
committee to delay action. This aroused
Jones of Arkansas, who questioned tho
right of the Senator to demand the rea
sons which may influence the actions Â«bf
any member of any committee. He could
not understand why Chandler should seek
to punish him, and intimated that Ci*tÂ»nd
ler must have some personal interest in
the resolution. Â¦-Â¦ â¢â¢
Chandler eaid that there was no uee for
the member of the Committee on Contin
gent Expenses to put on any disguise. It

tion of the character of that pending. The
matter finally went over. , >

The publication asserted that the com
bination had determined upon the passage
of those claims, even though an extra
session of Concress was forced in the ef
fort. Money declared that so far as he
knew no such combination ever existed.
He had never heard of any such combina
tion, and was catisned that there was no
desire on his side of the chamber to press
claims beyond their merits. He dis
claimed any intention to delay action

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 17.â The executive com

The cities desirouB of securing thÂ« en

Several ho"urs J were spent in debate and
: wlrile no place was definitely chosen the
claims .of Denver were "turned down" by
VTote-.of/B to 1. This does not settle the
matter as far as Denver is concerned, for
its --representatives say that- they will
fight the decision and will lay claim to the
convention. I The reason- for the decision
of the. committee -is 'that the terms re
quired by the Chicago encampment last
summer. were not complied with by Den
ver. At Chicago It was. voted to accept
Denver as the site, .provided that city
would secure railroad rates of one cent a
mile.- This matter was the point on which
the committee and the Denver representa
tive* -disagreed, the- Denvcrttes claiming
that the. rate was -practically assured,
while the executive committee refused to
accept the evidence and set a new date
to consider the claims of .the other cities.
January 21 was determined upon as the
date, the place of meeting to be an
nounced later by Commander Rassieur.
The Cleveland committee stated that the
one-cent rate had been promised by the
CentraT Traffic Association. The disap
pointed delegates at the meeting seemed
to be of the impression that Cleveland
would-be the place selected for the special
meeting and that that city would be se
lected for the encampment. .

The greatest obstacle that the State
Department has encountered in the effort
to collect our own claims was the vast
accumulation of European claims against
Turkey, leading: the Government of tliÂ«
latter country to plead that it could not
pay our claims without paying the others,
which would be utterly impossible. Tho
British claims are saia to be many fold
larger than our own. and if they are to
be pressed now. before our own claims
are collected, 1t i? feared that the Turkish
Government will use the fact as a basis
for declining to pay at present.
It is apprehended at the State Depart
ment that the reported intention of GrÂ»at
Britain to press at this moment for settle
ment of the claims of her citizens against
Turkey will have a disastrous effect upon
our own negotiations in the interests of
the American missions. The State Depar
rnrat never haa been officially informed
that the Turkish Government has ar
ranged to pay our claims, although the
British actkm is said to be predicated up
on a belief that our claims had been set
tled.

. The members of the board could not
see how West Point rules could govern
the - inquiry, but the young man would
not answer, although the information
was to a certain extent extracted from
him by a desultory fire of seemingly im
material questions. Albert saia that Booz
was not hazed any more than any other
cadet.- He was one of Booz' tent mates
while in camp, along with Anthony B.
Burnham of Kentucky. Albert then re
lated how he and Booz and other fourth
jlear men were made to do "ridiculous
stunts," such as making- the upper cldsÂ»
men's -beds and "other unmanly and dis
graceful" things. What ti.e unmanly and
disgraceful things were the witness re
fused to state, saying that it was none
of the public's business. He took the haz
ing because he expected it. He told of
one night when some fourth year men
were stood in a tent and told to open
their mouths and shut their eyes. They
obeyed and then some one squirted into
their mouths what was believed to be
tabasco sauce. It did not hurt Albert
because there was not enough of It. He
could not say whether Booz was one of
the victims, as they all had their eyes
closed. Albert said that when he was at
the academy tabasco, Worcestershire
sauce and catsup were used at mess.
He did not see the fight in which Booz
was engaged, but noticed that after that
encounter Booz was snubbed by tsome of
his own classmates and upper classmen.
He said he did not know Booz well
.enough to learn lf'he was of a religious
turn of mind, and added that Booz never
complained to him of ill treatment. After
some further unimportant testimony Al
bert was excused and the court adjourned
to meet at West Point tomorrow after
noon.
thought that if tabasco sauce had been
forced down Booz' threat it may have
made him more susceptible to the disease.
Sigrmond S. Albert, who had been a ca
det at West Point for fourteen months
and was a classmate of Booz, was called.
The young man at every question de
clined to answer. He had been asked to
state in a general way what sort of haz
ing had been indulged in at the academy,
but he absolutely refused to answer. He
was not afraid that he would incriminate
himself, he said, but refused merely on
the ground that at West" Point there was
a rule that no cadet should submit to haz
ing or stand by to see It done.

Iv/ tary board of inquiry 'appointed
, l~~A\jhy the of War to in-
IL^i/'vestigate charges made by the
relatives -and friends of Oscar L.
Booz, the former West Point cadet, that
he came to his death. on December. 8 at
his home here as the result of hazing by
fellow- cadets at the academy two years
ago, began taking testimony here to-day.
The board, consisting of Major General
John R. Brooke, commanding. the Depart
ment of the East; Brigadier General Al
fred E. Bates and Colonel J. H. Clouse,
deputy judge, advocate general, arrived
here this morning. They were met at the
railroad station by William H. Booz. the
father of the former cadet, and Rev. Alex
ander Allison, pastor of the Bristol Pres
byterian Church, the worshiping place of
the Booz family. The inquiry was held in
the pastor's study. The entire Booz fam
ily was present. The Inquiry began at
10:50 o'clock, the first witness called being
Mr. Booz, who was Invited to tell all he
knew. Mr. Booz stated that Oscar en
tered the academy on June 10, 189S.- Soon
after letters were received from him stat
ing that he had been hazed. . .;.
Mr. Bocz said tlyit his son had com
plained to him of tie indignities to -which
he was subjected at West Point, but
when Mr. Booz spoke to Lieutenant
Blakeley , about it he was told that the
hazing Â¦would stop after the cadets got
back in barracks. - He told, his son he
would have to stick to it.
Mrs. Boof, mother of the dead boy, and
his sister Nellie both testified to the let
ters they had received from Oscar while
he was at the academy. He told of hav
ing hot candle grease poured on him while
in bed, and Saving had tobasco sauce
poured down his throat, both in camp and
at the table. He was in one fight in
which he said he had his eyes blackened
and quit when he was winded. On an
other occasion he was called a coward
and told he was a disgrace to the corps.
Dr. Willis Weaver of Bristol the Booz
family physician, testified to the general
failure of Oscar's health after he returned
from West Point, but* refused to say
whether the condition of his throat could
have been induced by drinking tobasco
sauce.
Rev. Dr. Allison paid a high tribute to
the character of Oscar Booz. After the
young man had entered the academy he
received a. letter from Oscar in which he
told of 111 treatment, and said it was hard
to be a. Christian at West Point, but that
he would istick to it at any cost. Dr. Al

nett, president of the Young Men's Chris
tian ' Association at West Point, which
Â»statÂ«d-Mr, Burnett had investigated the
charges made .by the Booz family and
fourid them greatly exaggerated.
.'.In August a .letted was. received in
which Oscar said he had been in a fight
and, received a pair of black eyes, and
that he had been knocked out by a blow
oVer the heart: Mr. Bobz said he went to
West Point to see his son. Oscar told his
father he expected to be hazed, but he did
not want to be treated brutally. The
father said Oscar aid not want his mother
to know how he was being treatJti.
MY-. Booz then told how Oscar had in
formed him that tobasco sauce had been
forced down h.s throat. Mr. Booz aald
that when Oscar came home in the fall of
1698* he was broken in health and was
never well after that. Oscar liked fun,
the father said, but not brutality. While
in tents, the father continued, Oscar said
the cadets would pull the blankets from
him and pour hot wax from a candle on
his body. Mr. Booz also said Oscar told
him tha,t tobasco sauce was. poured down
his throat both in camp and at the table.
In answer to another question Mr. B003
said the only cadet he, the father, talked
Â¦with at "West Point was the son of ex-
Congressman Phillips of Ohio. Mr. Booz
thought the officers at the academy could
stop the brutality, but he would not say
they ' condoned it. All the cadets were
not treated like Oscar was, he said, and
he, Â¦was at a loss to understand why they
had treated his son in such a severe man
ner. Oscar spent all of last year at home
in an endeavor, to build up his health.
In "June of thig year he accepted a posi
tion with a laiv- firm at .Philadelphia, but
was compelled to leave, that -occupation,

NEW YORK, Dec 17.â An answer was
made to-day in the suit of Anton J. Dltt
mar against George J. Gould, Edwin
Gould, Howard Gould and Helen M.
Gould, as trustees under the last will and
testament of the late Jay Gould, to re
strain them from continuing to pay the
Count and Countess Bonl de Castellane
the Income of. the Countess from the
estate of Jay Gould.
The defendants allege that the Supreme
Court of this State has no Jurisdiction
over the person of the Count de Castel
lane or Anna Gould (Countess de Castel
lane), the alleged debtors; that they had
not either of them been served with the
summons in the action and have not ap
peared therein, and that the court is,
therefore, without Jurisdiction to decide
the question of how much of the income
is necessary to the proper support, and
maintenance of the Countess de Castel
lane.
The defendants also allege that the
plaintiff is not the real party in interest
and that the alleged assignment and
transfer to him 01 the alleged drafts and
acceptances and claims and causes of
action are without consideration and void,
and that at the time of said alleged as
signment and transfer to said plaintiff,
Asher Werthelmer, plaintiff's alleged as
signer, was not the owner or holder of the
said drafts and acceptances or claims or
causes of action, but had sold them to
Julius Cohen & Co., bankers, of London.
The defendants further claim that the
alleged indebtedness is for merchandise
sold to Count de Castellane and not to
the Countess and that by the law of
France, where said drafts were accept6.l
and payable, and also "bv the terms of a
certain ante-nuptial agreement, the
Countess is not liable for the debts of her
husband.
-The defendants say that a previous

The foundering of the Gnelsenau created

lowing the, reception tendered the sailors
and marines from China yesterday. The
news spread rapidly throughout the city
this morning. Great crowds thronged the
Admiralty building and the Ministry of

tives. Many touching scenes were wit
nessed, Emperor William has received a

Queen Regent.
MALAGA. Dec. 17.â It is rumored that
the commander of the Gnlesenau commit
ted suicide when he saw that all was lost.
A nephew of the Imperial Chancellor,
Count von Bulow, named Berndt, was
among the saved, though he was injured
about the head. A sailor who survived
the wreck went mad as a result of his
experience. The first engineer, the as
sistant engineer and a number of petty
officers were drowned.
It is hoped that the guns, the treasure
chest and perhaps part of the hull will
be salvaged. ? . -
Of the 314 survivors, thirty-nine who
were injured were transported to the lo

TOPEKA; Kans., Dec. 17.â General Man
ager Mudge of the Santa Pe left for Chi
cago this afternoon in his private c*ir. Mr.
Mudgo says his visit has absolutely noth
ing to do with the strike, but the strikers
say his visit there is occasioned by the
conference held ' between the officers of
the different trainmen's organizations and
the omcers of the read.
Mr. Dolphin, president of the Order of
Railway. Telegraphers, also left Tor Chi
cago to-night ana some interesting devel
opments may be looked for at once;
It is the purpose of the general manager
and the officers of the strikers and train
men's organizations to hold a conference
In Chicago to-morrow with J. W. M. Barr,
third vice president of the road.
When General Manager Mudge was ap
proached yesterday with the request that
he adjust the differences between the tele
graphers and the road he informed the
officers of the strikers that he could not
take such a step, and they would have to
interview Mr. Barr. The officers then
said they would present their grievances
to Mr. Barr at once.
The trainmen's officers, together with
the officers of the striking telegraphers,
will represent to Mr. Barr in Chicago to
morrow that the grievances of the tele
graphers should be settled at once. If he
refuses to take steps toward the settle
ment of the difficulties the officers will
then inform him that a strike may be ex
pected at once. â¢ Part of the plan of the
officers is thought to be the setting of a
certain date upon which a strike will be
ordered if the telegraphers are not pro
vided for.
President Dolphin seemed very Jubilant
this evening over the ultimate outcome.
"You can just state," said he, "that our
cause is In a better condition right now
than it has been at any time yet. - 1 have
held conferences .with the officers- of the
different trainmen's organizations and I
am confident that they, are with us. Will
they strike In sympathy?. Well, it would
not be proper for me to answer that ques
tion, as it would show presumption, be
ing as I am not connected . with the or
ganizations. But things are coming our
way, all right." he added, with a confi
dent smile. . "I : know It. I have seen
strikes before, and I will say that I have
never known one to be any more favor
able than this one right now. y We will

A special from Paris says: The cross of
the Legion of Honor has been confened
upon Madame Berosthorn, wife of the
Austrian Charge d'Affaires at Peking,' for
her heroic conduct and assistance to the
French during the siege of the legation.

soldier, and become a corporal, a sergeant
and then a lieutenant.. She served seven
teen years, went through twelve cam
paigns and was . eight times .wounded.
Napoleon decorated her personally in 1508.

FORMER PRESIDENT GROVER CLEVELAND, WHO SAYS THE DEM
OCRATIC PARTY HAS WANDERED AFTER STRANGE GODS AND
ITS ONLY HOPE IS IN A RETURN TO FIRST PRINCIPLES.
CHICAGO, Dec. 17.â Men who In the past
have bitterly opposed each other in indus
trial contests filled Stelnway Hall at to
night's conference on arbitration, which
began here to-day. Both the day and
night sessions were taken up with papers
read by representatives of capital' and la
bor looking to the same endâ a. cure for
strikes, from the tone of the addresses
it seemed plainly evident that both sides
were vigorously opposed to compulsory
arbitration, and if- a recommendation on
the subject of a .national board results
from the present gathering the recom
mendation wlil in all probability specify
that all. the board's work shall be along
the line of voluntary arbllration.
The night session was calied to order at
8 o'clock. After a few introductory re
marks by Franklin MacVeagn, the presid
ing officer* Henry W. Hoyt, president of
the National Founaers' Association, was
introduced. Mr. lloyt said in part:
"As long as the wage aarnei- beUevea oi
ls taught to arsume that society is in
league to rob h;m aB an individual of some
of the purchasing power of his services,
so long must society reckon with him in
his col.ective capacity. The employer who
elects to ignore this fact is as much of a
menace to the industrial peace as that
agitator who plays upon the prejudices
and inilames the passions of the men he
falsely serves. There is only one certain
rule o'f action. It was long ago called the
gold rule."
The next speaker was Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation ot
Labor. Mr.- Gompeis received a warm
welcome. At the outset Mr. Gompeis
stated that he decided to take positive
exception to statements that had been
made before the conference during the
afternoon. He had already, he said, ad
vised the gentleman whose remarks he in
tenued to critcize of his intention. Mr.
Gompers added:
"One of the things to which I took ex
ception was that, as an officer of the
Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad,
he should undertake In this conference to
present his side, the side of the railroad,
In a strike which Is still in progress, with
out a representative of the strikers being
here to present their side of the contro
versy. (Applause.) It seemed to me that
if the opportunity of this conference Is to
be taken advantage of for the presenta
tion of the railroad's side of this contro
versy due notice might have been given
to the representative of the Order of Hail
way Telegraphers. In order that he might
bo here to listen to what was said and re
fute it if necessary. (Applause.) .
"I am not prepared to say that what
the gentleman said was untrue. | but one
story is very good until the other side is
told."
Continuing. Mr. Gompers said that,
from the statement of the Santa Fe offic
ial, it would appear that all the over
tures toward conciliation or arbitration
In such disputes as that between the San
ta Fe and its telegraphers came from the
employers. Mr. Gompers asserted that,
on the contrary, where there had been
one offer from the side of associated cap
ital there have been hundreds on the side
of organized .labor. The employes, he
said, had become accustomed to hear
their proffers of conciliation met with
the answer that there is "nothing to ar
bitrate." He added, however, that he
was not unmindful of the fact that there
was a growing disposition on the part
of the employers toward a more concilia
tory policy. This condition, Mr. Gompers
believed.-was due to the growing strength
of organized labor. . -
Conciliation between ' two parties hav
ing diverse interests, he paid, Is only pur
sued when they have either equal power
or nearly equal 'power.
Though admitting that strikes ought to
be avoided in the interest of both capital
and labor, Mr. Gompers declared that
there were some evils* more dreadful
than strikes. He addod:
"We strike. People in China do not
strike. I wonder whether those who
would punish the workers for striking
would like to change the condition from
that which obtains In our country to
that which obtains in China. If the ab
sence of strikes was the measure of civ
ilization, then China nnght. to stand at
the hend of the world. (Laughter -and
applaupe.1
In conclusion he said:
"We shall insist upon the rlpht to onlt
work whenever the work becomes lrk
some to us, and we shall always insist on
our right to strike for any reason or for
no reason at all.
The session ad_1ourrÂ»ed until to-morrow.

continued the medicine, taking it regular-

pains and aches have all gone. I have rec-

and told them what it has done for me.
I will gladly answer any one who desires

Gentlemenâ Tn justice to you. I feel It is.. my duty to send you an acknowledge-

had bef n out of health for the past five years with kidney and bladder trouble. Had
our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being, but
the old complaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root, and I found It did me a world of good. Since then I have taken eight
small bottles bought at my drugstore, and I consider myself permanently cured. It
seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. I do not have to get
up during the n!ght to urinate, as I formerly did three or four times a night, but
now sleep the skep of peace. My back is all right again, and In every way I am a
new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-Root. They, like my-

to all humanity who are suffering from any kidney, liver or bladder troubles.
My brother officers (whos a signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself,

from the honorable court forbidding said
defendant to "knock" as aforesaid, or at
all. I
The complaint recites that in January,
1S97. Mary Coburn. the jockey's mother,
apprenticed the then but 13-year-old rider
to Lottrldge for a period of five years.
Mrs. Coburn was to be paid as follows:
Ten dollars a month for the first year. $20
a month for the second year. $30 a month
and $10 extra for winning mounts in the
third year, $30 a month and $15 for win
ning mounts in the fourth year and $40 a
month and $15 for .winning mounts in the
fifth year. Lottridge was also to have the
right to hire the boy out to other owners.
This contract Willie now repudiates as
illegal in itself and for the additional rea
son that his employer last spring cut him
loose without a shilling In New York,
having compelled him to go there against
his will. He further alleges "that at the
time of paid discharge the plaintiff, as
defendant well knew, was an utter
stranger in New York and utterly without
means to obUiin for himself common
necessaries of V.te and in danger of starv
ing, and that defendant wilfully refused
to make any provision whatever for the
maintenance of plaintiff, and wholly aban
doned plaintiff at said city of New I'ork.'.
Further the complaint says ""the defen
dant, well knowing the great demand for
the services of the plaintiff as a jockey
and rider, of race horses on race tracks
throughout the United States, has for
one year or more last past followed
plaintiff about from race track to race
track and has complained to Judges and
other authorities of race tracks, ' caus

to prevent his riding for any other
owner; that the Judges have invariably
decided in the jockey's favor, but that
"nevertheless the raid defendant, Lott

said mother of the plaintiff shall pay him
the sum of $2,500 he will continue his com

INDIAN AND PALEFACE
MEET IN THE RING
The change from Oakland to Tanforan
Park worked no beneficial result In the
performance of favorites, four heav-lly
hackod short-priced horses meeting de
feat reopening day at the San Mateo
County track. The card, not a very en
ticing one to bepln with, wore a shattered
look after ownÂ«rs had done with the
scratching blank, and. besides, failed to
attract the usual large attendance. The
track was muddy, and in an endeavor to
pick the dry going on the outside, some
rather peculiar tactics were resorted to
by two or three riders.
Beyond doubt, the severest blow dealt
the crowd was when Tappan grot the ver
dict from Walkenshaw b" a nope at the
finish of the mile purse run. Andy. Biake
ley's brown horse was heralded as a "Teal
Hindoo" in the rnud, causing the short
price of 3 to 5 to be accepted a.bout him.
At the start Coburn. on Astor. 'a 15 to 1
phot, went out In front, with the favorite
and Tappan trailing leisurely in his wake.
Turning into the stretch, Coburn went
very wide, carrying both Tappan and the
choice to the outside fence. Simmered
down to a drive, Dominick, astride Tap
pan, held his own with O'Connor, and on
the last jurnp, received the verdict. As
tor was third, beaten only a length.
Almost any one of the nine starters In
the first event, a five-furlong: scramble
for two-year-olds, looked to have a
chance, with the closing odds slightly
favoring Courtier, the entry of Louis
Ezell. Coming from the far rear, Mounce
pot home first with Cou?ar. beating the
12 to 1 chance. Ada X. Kiley lost all the
ground possible with the favorite, finally
managing to take show honors.
Mounce followed up this pood piece of
raddle work by capturing the seven-and
oxie-half-furlong run next decided, with
Hohenlohe. a 20 to 1 shot. Pat Dunne's
T^ainachus ruled favorite in the ring, but
despite Winnie O'Connor's desperate rid
ing, the outsider scored somewhat clever
ly by a length. At the head of the
Ftretch. Gllssando. which made, the run
ning, looked all over a winner, when Co
burn, by a wide turn, lost fully half a
dnzen lengths.
Toah. from the Corri^an stable, came
over from Ingrleside. and. with J. Waldo
up. took the second five-furlong dash for
two-year-olds. Well ridden, the filly was
hard pressed at the frilsh to down Ada
N a neck. Thracia ran a Hnse third.
In a race run at Oakland on December
B EFr'rardo displayed sneed for a panel
or two. and then settled back to rest In
the rear of the bunch. In the fourth
event yesterday, heavily played, the blacl%
gilding: loafed* along behind the 7 to In
choice Genua until >*raiphtened for home,
Â¦when Dominlck gradually let out his
wraps, winning under restraint. Moun
tain Vl*>w from "Doc" Street's stable,
â¢crhich finished third, broke down.
Only five faced the barrier In the sev
en-furlonfr event for maros excluslvelv.
The Lady, with Kilev in the saddle, ruled
favorite, and with 116 pounds tip von eas
ily from Preiudice. The Litter f.lly was
unfortunate in getting a poor start. How
ever, from the way the winner came in
it is doubtful whether the. result would
have been different under other condi
tions.

lately sued all members of the Board of

In the Hester district there are 998 pu- [
piis and two schoolhouses. The district I
lies between San Jose and Santa Clara, j
but is principally contrlbutary to this
city. The Alameda, which runs through
the center, is named as the boundary,
and the territory south of that roadway
and west of the city is proposed to be
cut off. There are 460 pupils in the dis
trict and a large schoolhouse. By divid
ing the district and annexing it to the city
the pupils would enjoy the benefits of the
San Jose High School, which is one of
the best in the State. A counter petition,*
which strongly opposes a division, is be
ing circulated,' and there probably will
be a warm contest.

SAN JOSE, Dec. 17.â Preliminary steps
have been taken for a subdivision of the
Hester School District, adjoining the city
on the south, and it is said the ultimate
end will be its annexation to the city. A

â¢ Unless the city takes the action de
manded by Edwards the. latter will bring
suit himself to have the money replaced.
At -present the money for lighting the
electric tower is tied up by injunction,
Edwards claiming that, although his bid
was the lowest for lighting the tower all
night, the matter was so juggled by the
Council as to give It to the Light and
Power Company. For lighting the rest of
the city all night Edwards' bid was the
lowest, but the Council later decided to
light the streets but half the night and
gave the contract to the Light and Power
Company. Now .it is claimed the com
pa/iy has put. in lights that were never
ordered and is charging for them.
At the meeting of the City Council this
morning II. T. Edwards, the manager of
the Electric Improvement Company, de
manded that a suit be commenced by the
Council In the name of the city of San
Jose against City Treasurer McGeoghegan
and his bondsmen for the recovery of J2700,
which it is alleged has been Illegally paid
to the Light and Power Company for
lighting the streets during the past five
months. In his demand Edwards alleges
that the claims of these months Include
charges against the city for lighting cer
tain electric lights for which there is no
contract or order. The Council referred
the matter to the City Attorney.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 17.â San Jose lighting
contracts undoubtedly will be the subject
of a suit soon to be filed in the Superior
Court and sensational developments that
will show the inside workings of city af
fairs are promised. The trouble grows
out of a fight between the two companies,
and charges of favoritism on the part of
the City Council toward the LJgrit and
Power Company, which now holds the
contract for lighting the city, are made.

ANGELS CAMP. Dec. 17.â Ami Laidet
of Esperanza, in this county, is the vic
tim of a peculiar affliction. One side of
his face is paralyzed and his eyesight is
affected, and his ailment is declared to
be due to the fact that he slept in the
moonlight. Laidct's couch was near a
window, over which there was no
curtain. Night after r.ight the silvery
raoonbeams were wont to stray in at the
window and beat upon his face. Gradu
ally paralysis set in, and recently Laidet,
awakened by pain during the night, con
ceived the idea' that his misfortune was
due to sleeping in the light of the moon.
He arose and improvised a curtain over
the window.
His condition on the following morning
was worse than at any previous time.
Since then, however, Laidet has kept the
curtain drawn upon the window, and his
improvement has been steady. He is re
covering his sight, and the paralysis is
disappearing. His physician says the in
valid will soon be fully restored to health.
Laidet is firm In his belief that but for
the discovery that he was the victim
of too much moonlight he soon would
have been in his grave.

SAN JOSE, Dec. 17. â A new phase was
edded to-day to the promised contest over
the estate of William B. Frue, the mil
lionaire mining man, who died at his home
heÂ»e on November 9, by the presentation
of a will for probate by Mrs. Maud B.
Frue, the widow. This evidently was done
to head off the petition of Public Admin
istrator Kell, who recently applied for
letters of administration on the estate.
Shortly after Frue's death Mrs. Frue
filed, a aeefi made by her husband on No
vember 8, giving to her all property, both
real and personal, belonging to him. '.A |
number ot creditors were dissatisfied with j
this and Public Administrator Kell applied j
for letters. In ihe application the .Public
Administrator alleged the estate to be
worth more than $10,Uuo and perhaps
$1, WO ,000. â¢ i
The will filed to-day is dated October
31 last, and in lieu ot signature contains
simply the testator's marn. The witnesses
are T. A. Perrin arid C. D. Wright. In it
all property is bequeathed to tne widow,
the child being omitted, as it Is declared
its mother will care for it. The value of
the estate is placed at $3500, consisting of
an fcaO-acre ranch in Alonterey County,
with a rental income of $250 a year. Mrs.
Krue asks that John H. Suits, her brother,
be named as executor.
There is a mortgage of $22,000 on* this
ranch, and the small valuation placed
upon it is' a surprise. The creditors of
the estate probably will contest the stated
value.
Those interested in the estate claim
there is yet another will in existence made
by l<rue, in which his realty holdings are
enumerated, and an attempt will be made j
to have it produced in court. The deed J
made by Frue to his wife probably will i
be attacked, so that creditors may obtain |
Judgments against the estate A hearing 1
on matters afCectfijg the estate will occur j
on Friday.

rROM the rains that have fallen so profusel)' in
all parts of the State, we can draw good auguries
of bountiful crops to come. We shall therefore
have large quantities of all kinds of California luxur
ies for sale next season. Why, then, should we not
take time by the forelock and at once do our best to
r.jake an eager market for them?
The season is propitious for such an undertaking.
Between now and New Year's day a great multitude
of gifts will be sent from this State to the East. These
gifts should be articles of California production. No
ether articles will be so welcome to the Eastern rela
tives or friends of Californians, for no other will be
sc thoroughly a Californian gift. Thus a double ben
ciit will be gained. We shall not only patronize home
iidusiries ourselves, but we shall help to create a de
mand for them in the East and thus bring about an
increased patronage from the people of those States.
It can hardly be necessary to remind Californians
that we have every kind of article appropriate for
Christmas remembrances and delights. We have
â¢â¢vines, fruits, raiÂ«ins, nuts, beautiful woods, pictures,
book* and many kinds of bric-a-brac. Why, then,
fhould we spend our money for articles of that kind
from "Europe?
In particular those industries engaged in working
up our orchard and vineyard products into fine wiriei
and the finer forms of fruit preserves and confections
merit liberal patronage. Although this is the- best
fruit and vine country in the world, we still import
from abroad large quantities of fruit confections and
wines. There is no reason for that sort of thing. It
is a result of the blind conservatism that goes along
the old way instead of turning aside to a better. Pat
ronize home. industries this Christmas. A single gift
will not be much in itself, but it "will help to make a
market that will consume large quantities of California
Sfoods later on. Be a helper in the cause.

CALIFORNIAUS IN WASHINGTON
ONCE more the Wholesale Seedsmen's League
has taken up the fight against the free distribu
tion of seed by the Government. The contest
is something like a forlorn hope, and yet it ought to
end in the success of the seedsmen, for there can be no
question but what the present 'practice of seed dis
tribution through Congressmen is a gross abuse of
what was intended to be a well-administered benefit
to the country. , . 'Â¦Â¦$!*Â£
As at first devised the distribution of seed by the
Government was confined to rare seed, was under
taken for tKe purpose of introducing new plants and
finer varieties of existing plants among the gardens
and fields of the country. It began at. a time when
newspapers were few, communication was difficult,
and the propagation of new plants was a work that
might rightly engage the attention and some of the
energies of the Government. The old conditions have
changed. In our time anything in the way of im
proved seed is circulated faster by private competition
than any Government can possibly do it. Enterprising
farmers, gardeners. and florists read with attention the
periodicals devoted to their industries, and are prompt
to learn of any new seed and to make use of it.
While the conditions of seed dissemination have,
thus changed; the'practice of the Government in mak
ing the distribution has changed also. It is no longer
a distribution of rare seeds. It is a free gift of nearly
all kinds of common seed. Of late years the Govern
ment annually gives away 24,000,000 packets of garden
seeds and tens of thousands of dollars', worth of flower
and field, seeds. The specifications call for 241,000
pounds of lettuce, onion, cucumber, beet, radish. and
melon seeds, and 15,000 bushels of sugar corn, peas
and beans, besides many thousand pounds and bushels
cf other products.
In protesting against the injury done to their.trade,
by this free distribution of seed, the secretary of the
Wholesale Seedsmen's League gays in a -recent:' cir
cular:
"For years the seed trade has been the only business
FREE SEED DISTRIBUTION.
It will be remembered that when Buller was on his
way to the front last year he announced *an expecta
tion of eating his Christmas. "dinner, in Pretoria. He
| did not keep his word, -Kitchener may eat Christmas
dinner in Pretoria this year, but he cannot eat it in
peace. He knows not -at what point along his ; scat
tered lines the Boers may .attack, nor what troop will
be captured next. Clearly the Chamberlain pro
gramme is one that will have to be postponed.. From
the, present outlook, it appears that if the establish
ment i>f civil government is to wait upon !' the suppres
sion'of the indomitable commandos of Dewet and De
larey, it ' is so remote that it does not deserve to be
considered a part of, practical politics. \
The programme is a good .one and won for Mr.
Chamberlain not ; only a^vote^of confidence in. Parlia
ment, but considerable approval from the world at
large. Fortunately for Chamberlairi, Parliament ad
jcurned for the holidays' almost immediately after the
speech was made.' Had it continued- in session but a
short time longer, ao'me .awkward -questions would
have been put to the Colonial Minister. /The success
achieved by the Boers in capturing large detachments
of tho best -British ttoops within the last few days
would have made. those questions inevitable; for how'
could there have been any discussion of the Chamber
lain programme since. the\ occurrence of those victor
ies, .without raising the inquiry: ' "How fare you going
to suppress the guerrilla war?"
DURING the brief session of Parliament, Mr.
Chamberlain, in reply to attacks upon him,
made a statement of the policy the Government
intends to pursue in dealing with the Boers. The
policy was embodied in a programme of three parts;
first, the restoration of order by the suppression of
the" guerrilla war; second, the establishment of civil
government under the form of a crown colony, with
equal rights to Boers and Britons; third, the erection
of both the Transvaal and Orange River colony into
self-governing colonies lttce Canada or Austral^ as
soon as possible. . .. : . Â¦ ' : ,^\: : :

FASHION HINTS FROM PARIS.
Our advice may not reach the stirring and excited
scene of these events, but if it could we would advise
the angry ladies, who seem so regardful of Mr.
Castle's feelings, that in lynching Miss Morrison they
may deprive him of a second matrimonial experience
thst would add to the exhibit Kansas can already
make as a !and p of vicissitude and novelty.
It is strange that none of the indignant and pros
pective lynchcrs has thought to discuss Mr. Castle.
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned," and as
Miss Morrison was obviously scorned, the "gentle
dames should admit that she had a right to out-hell
hell.
The ladies of Eldorado have divided into two camps,
and in one of them there is talk of organizing a lynch
ing party and hanging Miss Morrison to a lamp post
ci telegraph pole, if she is set free. This is to be done
exclusively by the ladies, with no aid, comfort or as
sistance by the coarser sex. The social fabric of El
dorado is split in two by the heat of the affair. The
local newspaper has been stoned by the Morrison
party, and that young lady defies her petticoated ene
mies, and says she does not fear them.
Mr. Castle, the gentleman whose surplus stock of
sttentions was the remote cause of the lamentable
tragedy, seems to be a self-centered sort of person,
with remarkable self-control. It is alleged that during
the trial of Miss Morrison for the crime of making
him a widower, he declared that the affair bored him,
and so-he got up a party and went hunting!
It may be that Mrs. Castle wore an air of triumph
with her wedding ring, but be that as it may, there
opened between the two women a great gulf of exas
peration, and they met one day with razors, and when
they parted Mrs. Castle's throat was slit beyond re
pair and the poor lady died. For this encounter Misi
Iviorrison has just been on trial, and a jury failed to
convict her. It is believed in Eldorado that she can
i:ct be convicted, and that her discharge will follow.
\A ISS MORRISON of Eldorado, Kansas, was
/ \ the recipient of the amatory attentions of Mr.
* Â¦ Olin Castle. Mr. Castle had a large assortment
ar.d general stock of such attentions, and bestowed
tome of the good; also upon Miss Wiley. A marriage
between him and the latter followed and Miss Morri
son was left with nothing but Mr. Castle's attentions
oa hand.
LYNCHING LADJES.
It is not' easy to understand why legislation to pre
vent a misuse of the flag should be opposed by any
one. Of course, a measure too drastic in its nature or
unskillfully drawn would be worse than no bill at all.
The American people in their love for the flag delight
in using it upon all occasions and it is right they
should have the full and free use of it so long as they
do not really desecrate it. Nevertheless, there is such
a- thing as making it too common, and offenses ot
that nature should be prohibited under a penalty ot
punishment. Thirteen States have passed such acts
and the nation should confirm their action.
Â¦-,.-:.. t .__,_,______.,_______, . ,
The history of former efforts to procure the enact
ment of such legislation is interesting. We learn from
the pamphlet that flag legislation was enacted in the
fifty-first Congress, May, 1890, by the House of Rep
resentatives, but the Senate rejected the bill as too
drastic. Representative J. A. Caldwell of Ohio, who in
troduced a flag bill in Jarfuary, 1894, resigned from the
fifty-third Congress. Repeated endeavors of Jacob H.
Bromwell of Ohio in the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth
Congresses met with discouragement in the Judiciary
Committee room, and Mr. Bromwell turned his atten
tion to other important legislation. William E. Bar
rett of Massachusetts attained no success with his flag
bill in the fifty-fifth Congress. Mr. Barrett declined a
renomination. The various flag bills introduced by
Representatives J. H. Davidson of Wisconsin, J. J.
Jenkins of Wisconsin, John Dalzell of Pennsylvania,
George E. Foss of Illinois, Ernest W. Roberts cf
Massachusetts, A. S. Toinpkins of New York and
others now lie in the Judiciary Committee room await
ing Congressional resurrection. In the Judiciary Com
mittee room of the Senate flag bills have been intro
duced by Senators Henry C. Hansbrough, John C.
Spooner, Joseph V. Quarles, Thomas C. Platt and
others. In 1898 General Griffin addressed a communi
cation to the flag committee of the Daughters of the
American Revolution as follows: "I have interceded
in behalf of flag legislation with members of the
Judiciary Committee until I think I have exhausted
their patience, and as to those candidates for Con
gressional nominations who refuse to commit them
selves to support and vote for some one of the flag
bills every patriotic citizen ought to feel justified in
opposing their nomination."
PROMOTERS of the movement for the enact
ment of legislation to prevent the desecration
of the national flag or its use for any un
worthy purpose have prepared for the campaign of
education on the subject a pamphlet containing strong
and unanswerable arguments in its favor. It contains,
moreover, statements from many of our greatest men
in favor of such legislation; and among them is no
less a person than President McKinley, who is quoted
as. saying: "Those^who seek to divert the flag from
its sacred uses should be restrained by public law."
LEGISLATION FOR ThJE FLflG.
The recently published inventory of. the estate of'
the late Cornelius Vanderbilt has attracted a goo'l
deal of attention in the East and it is noted with sur
prise that although the personal property is valued
a* $53,690,000 and the real estate at $20,000,000, the
estate contained no United States bonds or other pub
lic securities. Mr. .Vanderbilt preferred to U3e his
money in some industrial enterprise to investing it
in bonds, and consequently made it available in ad
vancing^ the general welfare of all who profit by in
dustry.
WHEN the French House of
Deputies passed a bill last
-week- forbidding -the Â¦ manu
facture or sale In France of
absinthe and- other- alcoholic
liquors which are pronounced "danger
ous" by tho Academy of Medicine It rec
ognized the terrible spread of the "green
terror," which . is said to be responsible
for the great Increase In â¢ Insanity and
other Bimilar afflictions among the French
people. Since 1894, as was pointed out in
the Chamber of Deputies, the amount of
absinthe consumed in .France has dou
bled, it now reaching the amount of 10,
000,000 litres, or , nearly. 10,060,000 quarts,
annually. .This.; amounts to one quart of
absinthe to each three Inhabitants, in
cluding men, .women and 'children. In
Paris the reports of the Ministry of Fi
nance show, that there : is an absinthe
seller to every three buildings in the me
tropolis. Already the green .terror has
killed many of the most brilliant men of
tho country. Guy. de Maupassant, Alfred
de Musset, Baudelaire, who translated
Poe's works into French; Theodore Bar
rlere, Andre Gill, the artist, and a host
of other men of letters and of genius
burned their- brains away with the green
name and died miserable deaths. ' Even
four years ago, before the habit had
reached half Its present strength, Henri
Rochefort started a crusade against its
use. In his appeal to the people he said:
"Absinthe is the bane of the nation and
is killing France."
The French nation did not go into the
drinking of absinthe of their own choice.
How it came to be introduced is a cu
rious story. During the Algerian war of
1844-47 the French troops, in Africa suf
fered greatly from tropical fever and
many things were tried as . preventives.
Among them was absinthe, and it was
found to be effective. The 'soldiers were
ordered to mix small quantities of it three
times a day with the ordinary French
wine which they drank, t They objected

There were a few suggestions ma_Â» by

dinner this past week, which showed a
changed aspect going on In the Christian
ministry of to-day. In a sense, there 13
no professional calling which stands at a
greater disadvantage. Its efficiency and
its Intellectual strength are evident, but
its attractiveness as a profession is on
the wano. No profession receives bo
much criticism, and no profession grows
so sensitive over it. No on* would pre
sume to take this same sort of freedom,
with the professions of law and medi

either Ignored or despised. Ministers, as
a class, in dealing with the people, have
too largely endeavored to shape their pro

of the people. Consequently they have
been made acquainted with strange
freaks In criticism and are exposed to

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
In the case of the Egyptian, Greek and Roman re
searches in archaeology, the world has the guidance
of much reliable contemporary history. But in Mexico
the mysteries of the ancient races are told only by a
few carved .stones. and these jade beads and ornaments
that must have come from Asia.
If the Spaniards had been less destructive we would
have had plainer trace's, of the introduction of Budd
hism than are now known. But there exist many
images of Quetzalcoatl that closely resemble the Chi
nese images of Buddha.
â¢ American universities may well turn their attention
to the archaeological field presented in Mexico. The
great Toltec pyramids at Teotihuacon and Cholula
are practically unexplored, as are large numbers of the
lesser teocallis built by the Aztecs.
Anthropologists have long reasoned in the same
line, from the physical resemblance between our In
dians and the Tartars. '
Captain' Evans is of the opinion that our Indian
tribes were of Siberian Tartar origin, as were the
Scythians, who scalped their enemies in war.
The theory held is that the Chinese and Tartars
coasted in their primitive craft up the Asiatic coast
until they reached the Aleutian archipelago and then,
always in sight of land, followed that chain of islands
to -the Alaskan coast, down which they skirted until
they reached Mexico, .which is believed to have been
the country called "Fusang" in Chinese annals.
President Diaz considers the new discovery of such
importance that he has devoted $200,000 for the pur
pose of a complete excavation and examination of
the teocalli. As the Chinese language has been writ
ten longer than any other living tongue and has
changed less than any, it is possible that under the
Mexican teocallis and their mightier predecessors, the
Toltec pyramids, may be found inscriptions in that
language which will reveal the origin of the primitive
American races.
The Two Republics says that jade is found only in
China, but Captain Evans, an archaeologist of repute,
corrects this. He states that jade is found only in
Siberia, India. China and New Zealand. This cor
rection, it will be observed, does not at all mar the
importance of the jade find in Mexico. Mr. Vining
in his work gives the evidence, from Chinese records,
that a Buddhist priest reached Mexico in the year
499 A. D. and returned to China, and his report to the
Emperor became common knowledge throughout
China, Japan' and Korea.
But enough did escape to rouse the keenest interest.
The Aztecs prized jade ornaments above all other per
sonal adornments, holding them more precious than
diamonds are now.
Unfortunately, the Spanish conquerors of Mexico
ruthlessly destroyed as much as they could annihilate
cf the ancient Aztec and Toltec records. Whatever
escaped them had to be too ponderous for their icon
oclastic rage to extirpate, or was hidden in the ground.
In this way evidences disappeared that would now be
invaluable to the archaeologist and historian.
nary bead form
The Two Republics says that excavations in that
city have uncovered an old Aztec teocalli in the ruins
of which have been found a thousand jade beads.
Beads and ornaments of jade have been found in
Mexico before, but this last find amounts to nearly
a half bushel of highly polished beads, ranging in
color from a pale to a dark green. The most numer
ous are two centimeters in diameter, and of the ordi-
Mr. E. P. Yining of this city has recently published
a summing-up of evidence bearing upon the Chinese
origin of the primitive Mexican races. Since that
publication the author's conclusions have been con
firmed by a startling discovery in the City of Mexico.
But we have nearer to us a more interesting field
for the archaeologist. There have long been evidences
of a remote Chinese occupation of Mexico. It will be
rtmembered that the excavations of Troy, made by
Schliemann, developed evidence that in the Troad,
under the Greek remains and beneath those of the
predecessors of the Greeks, were found pottery,
jewelry and metal objects, that were clearly of Chi
nese origin, proving that a Chinese city had once oc
cupied the Troad. Tn Mexico have been developed
evidences that that ancient race had a foothold there,
and developed institutions which influenced the Tol
tec and Aztec civilizations.

Andrew White Brown Said
to Be a Fugitive From
A well dressed young man named An

patch from Kulton, Oswego County. New

here'about ten days ago from New York
and registered at the Palace Hotel. He
claimed that ho was the son of a New

a trip around the world.
Late yesterday afternoon the head of

patch from the Sheriff of Oswego County
asking him to arrest Brown. His address
In this city was given as the Union
League Club. Detective Whitaker was
given the dispatch,- which contained a
good description of Brown, and ordered
to arrest him. Whitaker found film at
the Palace Hotel conversing with Jule
Gamage. a private detective. When shown
the telegram Brown laughed at Its con
tents, but did not attempt to conceal his
identity. Whitaker took him to police
headquarters, where he was closely ques
tioned.
Brown pretended to be at a loss to ac
count for his arrest, except that he, had
purchased several articles' of jewelry in
Fulton and left without paying for them
In full.
"You have no right to lock me up," in
dignantly declared Brown to the chief of
the detective force. "This is a civil mat
ter, not a criminal one."
Gamage. who accompanied Brown to po
lice headquarters, also Interceded for him
but to no avail. Brown was then escorted
to the City Prison and locked up in the
"tanks." Word was at once sent to the
Sheriff of Oswego County announcing the
arrest and asking for further particulars
about his alleged crime. An answer Is ex
pected some time to-day.

plate paper. Among the pictorial work
reproduced is a gTay day landscape by

artist's name famous. Then there is a

a. striking portrait by M. Froellch, bear

landscape by I* P. Latimer Is perhaps the
most striking single feature of the pub

the foreground reflecting on its inky sur

on its margin. The background of shad

foreground into striking relief. The whole
forms a remarkable example of the per

Democrats Speak of Him as
Probable Candidate for
Governor.
BOOM IS ON FOR
MAYOR SNYDER
Papers in Another Assembly Contest
Filed â Eugene Lacey- Claims
Election in the Twenty-
Eighth District.
The news published In The Call of De
cember 13 that leading Democrats . were
talking of bringing forward as their can
didate for Governor Mayor-elect ' M. B.
Snyder of Los Angeles has created a deal
of gossip in political circles. Members of
the Monticello Club, who claim to be the
true disciples of Thomas Jefferson, are
discussing the merits of Mr. Snyder and
wondering if he possesses the skill and sa
gacity to soothe the bitter factional fights
in their party. The Democrats south of
Market street are asking If Mr. Snyder
proposes to enter into a combine with
MayoT Phelan. Everybody In the political
swim seems to know what would happen
to the genial Mr. Snyder If; he should de
cide to cast his lot with the Phelanltes.
Eugene Lacey Is convinced that he was
elected Assemblyman to represent the
Twenty-eighth District In the Legislature.
Yesterday he filed a petition In accordance
with law as a preliminary step in the con
test to be seated in the Assembly. When
the Dalngerneld-Graham recount was or
dered Mr. Lacey engaged two competent
tellers to note the vote for candidates for
the Assembly in the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict. â¢ Each ballot was Inspected and, a
close tally maintained. The tellers report
ed to Mr. Lacey that the ballots, correctly
tallied, gave him a majority of four.
The returns in the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict as officially reported gave C. A.
Franklin a majority of seventeen votes,
hence he obtained a certificate of election.
Mr. Lacey must go before the Assembly
Committee on Elections to establish his
right to be seated. He remarked last night
that a recount of the votes, fairly con
ducted, would clearly establish his right
to represent the district in the Assembly.
He said that he did not ask for anything
but Justice and fair dealing, and he ex
pected that the Republican majority and
the Democratic minority in the Assembly
would see that justice was rendered.
Mr. Lacey was nominated by Gavin Mc-
Nab's exclusive Democratic convention,
which assembled at Odd Fellows' Hall,
and was Indorsed by the Citizens' Repub
lican convention, which met In Shlels
Hall. C. R. Franklin was nominated by,
the Kelly-Crimmlns convention at B'nal
B'rith Hall. He was brought forward by
Martin Kelly and he now belongs to Kel
ly's small bunch of statesmen. The Dem
ccratlc push, rounded up by Ralney and
others, supported Franklin. Four hundred
voters In the district, presumably Repub
licans, declined to vote for Assemblyman.
As a rule, the Republicans voted for
Lacey as a rebuke to the bosses, and the
Democrats helped Franklin to assist the
boss element.
At the Union League Club last night
there was another conference on the sub
lect ol the primary election law. The at
tendants were: Tlrey L. Ford. A. Ruef,
John F. McGlynn, Cameron H. Kins, Rev.
Dr. Scott, Joseph German and R. P. Troy.
The Legislature will surely give the
question of a primary election law careful
and prolonged deliberation. No doubt a
joint committee df the Senate and Assem
bly will hold open sessions to hear argu
ments and suggestions pertaining to the
proposed new law. TJje committee will
doubtless agree on some measure, and
when that agreement takes place The Call
will publish the text of the favorably re
ported bill. Â¦_

A VERDICT of suicide was the re
sult of the Inquest held yester
day afternoon in the case of Paul
Antolne, the French Vice Consul
who shot himself because of the
frequent quarrels with the woman to
whom he had been secretly married. An
toine died early yesterday morning.
After the reading of depositions of
minor witnesses the principal one was
called. "Send for Mrs. Madame Antolne,"
said Corcner Cole; "that would be the
proper way to address her."
The woman was heavily veiled when
the entered the room. Dr. Cole ordered
her to remove her veil and then in a slow,
dramatic way administered the oath.
Mrs. Antoine's testimony was practical
ly a repetition of the story published the
day after the tragedy. She said that she
married Paul Antoine on August 4 last

TELLS WIFE NOT TO GET
HIS BLOOD ON HER DRESS
BROKER INGOLD
AMONG MISSING
Liaves His Wife aud Three
Young Children Un
provided For.
He Secures Funds by Discounting
Shipping Receipts of Goods Fur
chased From Wholesale
Houses.
Last Friday morning Ingold left home
after bidding his wife and children good
by, as was his usual custom. He did not
take any of his clothing or other property
from his house and the first suspicion
that his wife had that she and her little
ones had been deserted was when she re
ceived a letter Friday night from her hus
band saying that he was about to sail
for China on the Rio de Janeiro and
would send her some money as soon as
he possibly could do so. To no other per
son did Ingold mention a word as to his
future movements. Investigation yester
day by detectives showed that Ingold,
after securing the bills of lading from thÂ«
{*.rms he had purchased gooes from In
the past two weeks, took the documents
to the Hongkong Bank and discounted
them. He also drew all the money he
had on deposit In the First National
Bank and :t is thought that he secured
$10,000 by these means. Ingold'-s name
does not appear on the passenger list of
the Rio de Janeiro and if he sailed on
that vessel he did so under an assumed
name. It Is thought In some quarters
that Ingold has fled with a fair compan
ion.
At his wife's suggestion Ingold went
Into business for lumself and opened an
office at li# California street, where h-i
represented Gurnow & Co. of Yokohama;
Â« ymark & Co. of Kobe, Japan, and
Franklin. Baker & Co. of Philadelphia.
With the credentials of these firms In-
Ifold had little difflcu'ty in purchasing
goods for shipment to China. His
intimate friends tuy that with the
proper devotion to business Ingold
could have built up a good financial
standing, for he was ihougnt well of by
all the wholesale houses he had trans
actions with. But to his regrular family
expenses Ingold was adding those of the
"cocktail route" and the region where the
lights burn red when respectable men are
ax home.
To the business houses with which In
eold bad dealings, the news of his
flight will come with surprise, but to
those who know of his movements
In the tenderloin, his latest escapade will
not be unexpected. Ingold is a good look
ing fellow about 25 years old and had
be~.a connected .with a number of well
known nrms tlnce his youth. About four
years ago he married an estimable young
lady who resided across the bay ana wlui
his wife's money ttarttd In business with
a man named Knuctskon In the commls
elon.llne. The firm did not last long and
Ingold and his partner socn went to the
wall, Mrs. Icgoid losing every cent oj
the money which her husband had In
vested.
Fred Ingold, a young commission mer
chant, is reported missing, together with
a considerable sum of money. The sup
position is that he is headed for China.

last evening for throwing a stone
through one of the front win-
dows in the priests' residence
adjoining St. Patrick's Church.
The woman, who Is about 30 years of age
and evidently incompetent, had a charge
of malicious mischief placed opposite her
name at the Southern police station, from
which she was later transferred to the
Hall of Justice.
Father Cummlngs, pastor of St. Pat
rick's Church, reported to the police yes
terday that some culprit had broken one
of the windows in his house on Saturday
evening. He stated that another window
had been broken some ' time previously
and requested that steps be taken to ar
rest the guilty party as he feared a rep
etition of the offense. Captain Gillen de
tailed Policeman John Moriartty to watch
for the offender yesterday at noon. Mo
riarity was dressed in citizen's clothes In
order* to avoid suspicion. He waited pa-
heels, pursued by the lady, and at Golden
Gate avenue and Eddy street he ran into
the arms of Policeman W. F. Hasklns.
On being searched at the City Prison
several pieces of Mra.: Irwin's jewelry and
a Canadian bank note were found on the
robber, who gave the name of John Hud
son.
The woman was so Irrational that Cap
tain Gillen ordered her to be taken to tho
Hall of Justice Immediately, where she
will be carefully watched so that ahe may
do no violence to herself. \.
The woman would say but little about
herself when questioned. She said she
was born In County Kerry, Ireland, but
did not know her own age. She came
here three or four months ago and was
employed by a Jewish family on Eddy
street. The name of the family and the
number of the house she did not know.
She muttered something about having
enemies, but professed Ignorance when
asked who they were.

o'clock he was accosted by the Lawler
woman, who engaged him In conversation.
The woman was evidently deranged and
wandered in her talk. Monarlty turned
to walk away and at that instant the
woman hurled the stone through the win
dow. The missile, a piece of granite about
the size of an apple, was secured as evi

Inclosed was a typewritten slip with
the name W. F. Tripp, I.os Angeles.
Fritch was arrested shortly afterward
in Fresno County for using the mails for
the purpose of defrauding his correspond
ents and served a year in prison. He was
very much cast down when Chief Hazen
placed the handcuffs upon his wrists In
his room on Stevenson street last Thurs
day. Pretending to be suffering from a
pain In the heart, he asked Chief Hazen
as a favor to pass him a certain bottle
on a shelf containing medicine, he said,
prescribed for him for heart weakness.
The Chief took a whiff at tho bottle and
found that It contained chloroform.
Fritch then informed his captor that he
had Intended to commit suicide In the
event of his detection. He had set his
heart upon making a fortune by his lat
est counterfeiting venture and had spent
night after night, he said, In the public
library in this city consulting books upon
the properties of metals, such knowledge
being essential to him In- his nefarious
business.
Fritch has a 17-year-old son, Nelson
Fritch, working in Los Angeles, but he
is leading an honest life. Emmet, the
other son, who Is under arrest, will .be
prosecuted. Chief Hazen having come Into
possession of letters written by him that
show him to be an accomplice of his
father. He Is only 19 years old.
they would have been taken without hes
itation except by experts In the handling
and examination of coins, their only de
fect being lightness.
Chief Hazen succeeded yesterday in
welding the chain of evidence that will
convict William Benton Fritch, the father,
and Emmet B. Fritch, the son, and that
will insure to the old man at least a long
term in the penitentiary as a profession
al criminal. This evidence consists of a
series of letters written by Fritch in 1SV6
to his dunes when he was engaged In a
remarkably ingenious urneme to prey
upon the cupidity of his correspondents.
Under the name of "W. F. Tripp" at Los
Angeles he wrote to several hundred per
sons In this State and elsewhere, announc
ing the formation of a secret company of

After receiving a reply to his circular an

sample of the coins for sale by him. He
advised the recipient of this sample to
take It to the bank and ascertain whether

temptation to the dupe who believed that
the genuine piece had been manufactured
by the syndicate, to invest in a large
number of the Illicit coins as a sure-thing

WHEN George "W. Hazen. Chief
United States Secret Service
Agent for the Pacific Coast
Division, arrested the
Fritches, father and son," in
their room at 560 Stevenson street last
Thursday, he made a capture of
one of the most dangerous coin
counterfeiters on record. In all there
was J3G00 face value of ten-dollar
pieces ready for gold plating found In the
room, and the counterfeits are pronounced
l>y Chief Hazen to be the best on record.
In a few more days these coins would
have been put into circulation. The Im
pression and reeding were so fine that
not at all unlikely. General Manager
Kevin of the Santa Fe Bays that so far as
he knows his company is not contemplat
ing the construction of a line from Salt
Lake City, nor does he know of any com
bination with the Southern Pacific.
"You can say, however," added Mr.
Nevln, "that the Santa Fe will protect its
Interests, and we don't propose to have
our valuable properties in Southern Cali
fornia suffer from Increased railroad com
petition if we can help it. Just what will
be done remains to be seen. The Clark
road has not been built yet, you know."
It Is known that the Union Pacific ana
the Southern Pacific both have had sur
veys made from Salt Lake to Los Angeles.
It was Collls P. Huntlngton's plan to
build this road early in the coming year,
and Judge Thomas Marshall of Salt Lake
City, who represented the Huntlngton
railroad interests in that region, was
quoted not long ago as saying that but for
Mr. Huntington's death the road would
have been commenced by now.
Three surveys were also made some
years ago by the union Pacific, but It is
understood that Senator Clark has se
cured these, along with other Important
data gathered by the Union, and these
will prove of greatvalue to the San Pedro,
Los Angeles and Salt Lake Company.
A story come3 from the southern part of
the State to the effect that a prominent
railroad man in Los Angeles has made
the statement that "the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe w'U have direct rail commu
nication with Salt Lake before any other
company." He goes on to say that the
Clark road, with the connections which
it may establish at Salt Lake, will prove
a powerful competitor for transcontinent
al business.
"Consequently," he adds, "it will be
hoove other lines to form a new conectlng
link with the least possible delay."
The impression seems to prevail thaf the
next two years are to see an unprecedent
ed amount of railroad building in the
West.
The Connections Which Salt Lake
Company May Establish Will
Bring It Big Transconti
nental Business.
Both the Southern Pacific and the Santa
Fe companies are trying to hit upon a
scheme which 'will -give them more direct
rail communication between Salt Lake
City 'and Los Angeles. This fact is not
denied by officials of both companies, but
further than :o assume that better rail
road connections must be forthcoming to
meet the keen competition that is bound
to result upon the completion of" Senator
Clark's new road tho officials decline to
make any statement.
Vice President J. C.Stubbs of the South
ern Pacific is expected home this evening,
and he may be able to throw some light
on the situation In so far as the Southern
Pacific is concerned. It is stated by one
who professes to be on the Inside of
Southern Pacific affairs that the directors
of the company have already taken up the
matter, and several plans have been dis
cussed for meeting the competition of the
Clark road. ;
It was rumored on the street yesterday
that a pool of Interests between the
Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe was

Fe May Ba Forced to

a lever 135 inches from the fulcrum, what
weight will It lift forty-five Inches from
the fulcrum? (Ans. 1440 pounds.)
1. A lever has the fulcrum between the
weight and the power. The weight Is three
inches from the fulcrum; the power is
twenty-one inches from the fulcrum.
What power will lift a weight of 140
pounds? (Ans. 20 pounds.)
Una lever of the second class the arm
of the power is thirty-six feet and the
arm- of the weight Is twenty feet. What
power will support a weight of ninety
pounds? (Ans. a0 pounds.)
Exercises for Practice.
If we know the length of the arms, that
Is. the distance , between the power and
the fulcrum and the distance between the
weight and the fulcrum, and we know
either the weight or the power, we can
find the other.
Equals Weight X Its Arm.
It must be noticed, however, that when
a lever raises a weight it will be found
that the work done on the weight is ex
actly equal to the work done by the pow
er. For example. If a weight of 100 pounds
is supported bv a force of five pounds
with a lever of the first class the arm of
the power is twenty times as long as the
arm of the weight, and It therefore must
move through twenty times the distance
through which the weight moves. What
is gained In foreÂ© is lost in distance
moved.
General Bole. â Power X Its Ann
One of the most important problems
which an engineer haa to solve is how to
raise heavy weights. "With a lever the
ratio of the two forces the power and the
weight, may be made by properly arrang
ing the length of the arms, as small or as
great as we please. Hence we may with
a lever support as great a weight as we
please with as small a force as we please,
provided the fulcrum Is fixed and the lever
Is strong enough.
The capacity for counteracting a large
force with a smaller one is called mechan
ical advantage. A lever of the first class
ha9 mechanical advantage when the pow
er arm Is longer than the weight arm. A
lever of the second class has always me
chanical advantage.
Insults Offered Women.
The witness was allowed to continue
and be said: â .
"General Warfield told me of the poker
games conducted by Baron Von Schroeder
and others. He had protested, but it did
no good. He made the statement that cer
tain fool women had made It so easy for
the Baron that he thought he could in-
Eult any woman with impunity. He toid
<>f an elderly woman and her two daugh
ters who were annoyed by the Baron's
attentions; if they walked in the grounds
he would follow them and bob up from
behind rosebushes and appear at unex
pected places.
"The general eaid that the golf links
which were once very popular and
brought custom to the hotel, had become
almost deserted because the conduct of
Baron von Schroeder and hla cronies there
was such as to drive away respectable
t>eople.
"He mentioned the caae of a young
woman who had come to the hotel a re-
Maguire objected to the Question as
calling for testimony introducing: allega
tions made by other parties, the truth of
which was not known to witness, but the
court held that evidence tending to show
the circumstances Furrcunding the pub'i
tation was admissible. \vitness an

"Prior to October 24, 1S93, Frank I* Per
kins, our San Rafael correspondent, came
to my office and said that General War
fteld was about to give up his lease of the
Hotel ilafael. as he understood, because
of the scandalous conduct of Baron von.
B* broader having rendered It unprofitable.
I told him such matters could not be pub-
Usbed on hearsay, and the matter was
droppwl for the time.
Pf-rkir.s informed mo that Mrs. 'Vv'ar
fi<-!d had told him in the presence of Gen
era! Warfield that they would ask for a
relpai" 1 . Octo-ber 24 I received a. telegram
from Perkins saying that the release whs
to b<Â» signed that day. I called up General
"VVarfleld rÂ»r telephone and told him I had
received this information and wanted to
f^nd a reporter to interview him. He re
grÂ«?ttÂ«d that the Information had leaked
out and said he would see mÂ«Â» personally
if I would come with the reporter.
"I tor.k \V. HL Raymond, a reporter on
The Call, and went to the California
Hotel for the interview. I conducted it
and direcu-d Raymond to take down the
answers. After some preliminary con
versation General Warfield confirmed the
report that the l?aso was to be surren
dered. He said jhe Baron's conduct had
brought scandal upon the hotel and had
driven many respectable people away.
Formerly he had nad a good Sunday-to-
Monday trade, as he termed it. but the
Baron's conduct ha-d caused that trade to
fall away."
The witness saJi that General Warfleld
had said in plain English that the Baron
had acted like a low. vile character; that
ho had said to him that there was a cer
tain prominent society woman of San
Rafael whose relations to Baron von
Schroeder were liable to become a public
f-candal at any time. She. the general
had asserted, was in the habit of inviting
voung women to parties or dinners given
by the Baron and abetting him In de
bauching them. Iv v '
As the recital went on Maguire again
interposed an objection, saying that there
must be a limit to the charges that could
be made in testimony upon the assertions
of eome one else. Attorney Preston re
torted:
"If this man was engaged in debauch
in? young women we contend that such
conduct blackened the name of the hotel
and that we have a right to introduce
<videncÂ« to that effect in proof of the
truth of the article alleged to be libelous."

to remove plaintiff's cause for action. He
Fubmitted the article upon which suit was
â¢based, and it was admitted in evidence.
Â¦ Counsel announced that the plaintiff's
case rested.
E- F. Preston offered the answer of de
.fep.'l.'-.r.t. and it was ordered filed as part
of record, and the defense proceeded.
"The defendant do^p not deny the pub
lication." began Mr. Preston, '"of the ar
ticle in question. The defendant will at
tempt to establish the truth of the alle
gations. But only a part of the article
published is included in the complaint,
\\'e offer the remainder of it in evi
dence."
Counsel for plaintiff consented to such
admission to evidence.
"If the article is true," Preston re-
Fumed. "and we can prove that the gen
eral trend ot it is true, and we expect to
rrov* tha.t, then the defensa Is esta.b
li^herl.-'
Maguire objected, saying the statement
vas argument and in addition was a false
statement of the law. Colonel Preston
sa.id his statement of the law was the Su
preme Court's interpretation of It.
"The other defense." continued Colonel
Preston, "that will be offered is mitiga
tion; that Is, good faith on the part of
defendant in the publication, the belief.
:.:â¢â¢ r due investigation, that the facts as
set forth were true."
Defendant's counsel asked for and was
granted a recess of ten minutes before
calling the first witness.
\V. t?. Leake, manager of The Call, wat
the first witness placed on the stand.
After preliminary questioning Attorney
Preston asked:
"Do you know anything about what oc
curred in relation to that article before it
was published?"
"1 do."
"What information did you receive and
from what sources?"
We mnirni that the article was wanton.

The iÂ»wÂ«"t of a *rr<Â»a.t newspaper to blast the
r<*;njtatlnn of a. man against whom the pro
}Ti*tor had pome personal grudge.
Mr. Delmas objected to Maguire's as
sertions as being in the line of argument,
and Judge Angellotti agreed with him.
Maguire concluded his statement by the
exertion that the alleged facts as pub
lished would have to be shown to be
familiar to the hundreds of people who
were guests at the Hotel Rafael in order
terms JufigÂ© Maguire asked the usual
questions as to residence, occupation, ac
quaintance and impartial attitude as to
the action before ihe court, and passed
the juror.
D. M. Delmas. for the defense, asked:
* Do you think it right for a newspaper
to publish the facts of scandalous and
immoral conduct of an individual, even
though that publication mav involve cer
tain other individuals, when those fact-*
a-nd conduct affect public morality?"
'No, sir, 1 think not."
"You think it has not the right T'
.. t x * rnay have the right, but I do not
think it would look Just right."
.. * ou would go into the jury box with
that attitude, and it would take evidence
to remove it?"
"Yes, it would."
"We challonge the Juror," said Delmas.
Twelfth Juror Accepted.
Judge Angellotti p.sked Gallagher if he
\ not be ahle to render a verdict on
The evidence, fair and impartially, and
<_Â»a_.laeher said that he would.
"Assuming that the article be of such
description as 1 stated a moment ago,"
nvUed Delmas. "would you not start out
x:;Â»on your duties as a juror with the Im-
I-ressjon that the defendant had done
Â¦wrong. Did I not understand you to say
that uie paper, in such a case, had done
wrong in your opinion?"
"Yes. that's what I said."
*l ou think the paper does wrong if the
affair affects public morality?"
"Thpv could publish it if they desired,
rut 1 think it would be doing wrong."
J^dge Angellotti did not think the jur
or - position was such as to disqualify
him. as he had asserted his ability to
1 ring in a fair and impartial verdict.
Plaintiff passed the juror, and after a
fhort conference with his associates,'Del
mas said. "We are content with the jur
tr." and the jury was completed.
The jury consists of the following:
1. Eartori, Fan Rafael; Owen Casey, San Ra

Ex-Judge Maguire opened the case for
plaintiff, reciting the publication of the
article alleged to be libelous and reading
the complaint upon which the suit was
1 ftsed. Continuing, he said:

and "the."
A common blunder in the use of articles
consists in using "a" for "an" and vice
versa. "A" and "an" are different forms
of the same word, and the choice between
them in the usage of good speakers and
writers is determined by sound. Before
a vowel sound "an" is used; before a con
sonant sound "a" is used.
Sound and spelling do not always coin
cide. For example, "one" and. "unit" be
gin with vowels, but ihe initial sounds
are those of the consonants "w" and "y"
in "won" and "you"; therefore, we say
"a unit," "such a one." "Honor" begins
with a consonant, but the initial sound
is that of the vowel "o" in "onset"; there
fore, we say "an honor."
Usage is divided as to "a" or "an" be
fore words beginning with "h" and ac
cented on the second syllable. "We say
'an historical sketch" or "a historical
Buetch," according to taEte.
The use of a superfluous "a" or "an"
before a class name, especially after the
words "sort* and "kind," is a common
and obstinate error. We may say, "This
is an. eagle." meaning "one eagle." Fut
we may not say, "An eagle Is our national
bird." "This is a rare leind of an eagle,"
or "It is not worthy of the name of an
eagle";' because in these sentences
"eagle" is used as the name, not of a
single bird, but of a class of birds, and
includes in its meaning all the birds
which belong to the class called "eagle."
Another blunder in the use of articles
occurs when a person forgets that "A
pink and lavender gown" is not the same
thing as "A pink and a lavender gown."
The first expression in which the article
is used only once denotes a single gown
of mixed color. The second expression,
in which the article Is repeated,
denotes two gowns, one pink, the other
lavender. Similarly, "The secretary and
treasurer" denotes one person, while "The
secretary and the treasurer" denotes two.
Adjectives and adverbs are best consid
ered together in an account of common
blunders in using them.
An adjective is a word joined to a noun
or a pronoun by way of limitation or de
scription: as "Black horses"; "He 13
lazy."
An adverb is a word joined by way of
limitation to verbs, adjectives and other
adverbs: as, "The horses ran fast";
"She sang well."
The most common form of adverb in
literary English ends in "-Iy." It is made
freely from all kinds of adjectives except
those that already end In "-ly." Adjec
tives that already end in "-ly." as "live
ly" and "friendly," usually have no cor
responding adverb. We use instead some
adverbial phrase: as "in a friendly way,"
"in a lively manner."
Adjectives used as adverbs are fre
quent in literature of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries: as, "Then was the
king exceeding glad" (Daniel, vi, 23>;
"The sea went dreadful high" (Robinson
Crusoe). They also occur somewhat free
ly in modern poetry. In modern literary
p"rose they are seldom used, good writers
preferring the adverbial forms in "-ly"
except in a few cases which may be
learned by observation: "Pitch dark";
"He ran fast": "Come quick"; "Stand
right"; "I bought it cheap."
A very common blunder is to use the
adjective "good" for the adverb "well"
as in the incorrect sentence, "This pen
will not write good." "Good" should be
used only as an adjective describing a
noun or a pronoun, never as an adverb
limiting a verb. The following sentences
are correct: "He had a good sleep"; "He
slept well." .
This i (plural these) and that (plural
those) are the only adjectives In English
that have distinct forms for the plural.
A common mistake Is to use the plural
forms with singular collective nouns: as
"kind," "class," "sort." The following:
sentences are correct: "That kind of
house is common in New England";
"How do you like this sort of horse?"
Persons are sometimes In doubt whether
to use an adjective or an adverb after
certain verbs as "grow," "look." "sound,"
"smell," "taste." If the added word ap
plies to the subject of the verb, it should
be an adjective; if to the verb, it should
be an adverb. We say, "We feel warm,"
when we mean that we are warm: we
say, "We feel warmly on this subject,"
when we mean that our feeling is warm.
"As a rule, it is proper to use an adjective
whenever some form of the verb 'to be'
or 'to seem' may be substituted for the
verb, an adverb when no such substitu
tion can be made." Thus, "He looked
angry; he spoke angrily." Sometimes we
may use either adjective or adverb with
no difference in meaning: as. "We were
sitting quiet (quietly) round the fire." The
following sentences are correct: "Velvet
feels smooth"; "Roses smell sweet"; "The
wind blew furiously": "The men fought
gallantly"; "Ethel looked beautiful in her
new gown"; "He has acted strangely."
Sometimes blunders In the use of ad
jectives and adverbs are committed in
comparing two or more things with one
another. To say. "Iron is more useful
than any metal" is clearly incorrect, be
cause iron is Included in "any metal."
and of course iron is not more useful
than itself. We must in thought set iron
off in a class by itself, which we can do
by Inserting "other" after "any." "Iron
is more useful than any other metal" Is
correct. After comparatives accompanied
by "than," the words "any" and "all"
should be followed by "ether." Â¦
To say "Iron Is the most useful of any
(or any other) metal" is also clearly In
correct, because we mean that iron is the
most useful, not of "one metal (no matter
which)," or of "some metals (no matter
which)," but of a*l metals. We should
therefore omit the word "any," saying
simply "Iron is the most useful of (all)
metals." It is also incorrect to say "Iron
is the most useful of all other metals,"
for Iron Is not one of the "other metals."
Beware of using "any" or "other" with
superlatives followed by "of."
Amusing ' blunders are often made by
the careless placing of words or groups
of words used as adjectives or adverbs.
As a rule, a modifying word or group of
words should come next to word or words
which it modifies. The following blunders
of this kind actually occurred in real
life:
"A lady wants to sell her piano, as she
is going abroad, in a strong Iron frame."
"Lost, a green enameled lady's watch."
"Wanted, a room by two gentlemen,
about thirty feet long and twenty /feet
broad."
"We all went to the seashore for a little
fresh air from the city."
"LÂ»ost. a Scotch terrier, by a gentleman,
with his ears cut close."
"Wolsey left many buildings which he
had begun at his death m an unfinished
state " >'**- 'â¢'
"My cousin caught a crab and took it
home In a pail of water which we had for
our tea." . . " .
The placing of the word only requires
special care. Observe how the position of
only affects the meaning of the following
sentences: "Only he lost his hat." "He
only lost his hat." "He lost only his hat."
or "lie lost his hat only." "He lost hia
only hat."
In the use of Articles, Adjectives and
Adverbs.

A rigid search of all the pawnshops In
this 'city failed to discover the slightest
trace of any of the articles stolen from
the Stewart Hotel or from the Campbell
residence. The detectives, however, 'did
discover that Miss Bellingham had, during
the summer, pawned the Jewelry which
she wore on her arrival at the hotel.
Detective Harper some weeks ago traced
the trunks of Miss Bellingham to a stor
age warehouse, and searched them. Why
be did so he declines to tell. . I
A young student of St. Ignatius College,
who called upon ftlies Bellingham during
the summer, tells of seeing in her open
trunk a number of silver spoons, and his
description of them tallies with that of
the spoons which formerly adorned the
Campbells' tables.
Among the articles stolen from the
Campbejls were many silver spoons and a
real lace collar of special design.
While supposed to be visiting the Camp
bells, Miss Bellingham called at the Stew
art to make social calls, wearing a lace
collar which is described by those who
saw It as being similar In every respect
to the one purloined from Mrs Campbell.
Another remarkable similarity was the
possession by Miss Bellingham of em
broidered napkins that were counterparts
of those which Mrs. Campbell lost One
of the ladles residing at the Stewart tells
of a peculiar brooch which the little Eng
lishwoman wore when on a visit, such a
brooch also figuring in the list of stolen
goods from the Campbell residence.
Previous to thia event Miss Bellingham
announced that she was going to visit
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell for a few weeks.
As a matter of fact she Â¦was hired to Â¦wait
on Mrs. Campbell, who is an invalid. De
tectlve Harper has a long list of articles
stolen from the Campbells at the very
time that Miss Bellingham was residing
with them, consisting of valuable jewelry,
money, clothing, silks and silverware.
But one lady residing at the Stewart
had little faith in Miss Bellingham. One
evening she visited the bathroom and left
a valuable diamond ring there. Miss
Bellingham entered the bathroom soon
after the lady in question had vacated
it. Shortly afterward there was a scene.
Accusations passed to and fro, with the
result that Miss Bellingham left the hotel.
Detective Harper has for five weeks
carried In his pocketbook a photograph
of the fair Daphne, and while he has been
unable to locate her, she has been seen on
the streets and at the theaters, sometimes
wearing articles of dress which bear a re
markable similarity to some of those pur
loined from Mrs. Campbell.
Early in the summer Miss Daphne Bell
ingham arrived at the Stewart and an
nounced that she was prepared to remain
for some months. She spoke of her rich
relatives in England and claimed relation
ship with nearly all the families who ap
pear In Burke's Peerage. .
If, .in the course of conversation, the
names of any of the English nobility
were mentioned, the dashing Daphne
would at once claim them as blood rela
tives. It took but a little time for Miss
Bellingham to be on friendly terms with
all the guests of the house and she made
frequent social calls to the apartments of
her lady friends. The young men who
resided at the Stewart were fairly car
ried away in the desire to please the
young Englishwoman, ror she was sup
posed to have plenty of money. Coinci
dent with the freedom of the rooms of the
guests granted to Miss Bellingham, trin
kets and valuable goods were missed, but
not for a "moment were me thefts charged
to any visitor, least of all to the English
woman.
All of' the parties mentioned above
would like to. have a talk with Miss Bell
ingham, for they think that she. might be
able to throw light on the subject of val
uable goods stolen from the guests of the
Stewart Hotel and from Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell during the last few months.
If Miss Daphne Bellingham. a dashing
young Englishwoman, is in the city,
knowledge of her whereabouts would
bring joy to the hearts of Detectives Har
per and Armstrong and also to many
guests of the Stewart Hotel, Kills and
Leavenworth streets, as well as to H. P.
Campbell, bookkeeper of the National
Iron Works, and his wife, who reside at
1310 Hyde street.

Court Notes.
debauched her there In the hotel. An
other woman had been degraded through
the machinations of the Baron and his
brother. Many reputable guests had been
driven away from the hotel. His wine
sales had been cut down 65 or 70 per cent
on account of the Baron's conduct. He
also said that the Baroness* friends no
longer came to the hotel on account "
Maguire objected and the objection was
sustained. The witness continued:
"General Warfleld said further, 'There
are a lot of fool women who have been
easy. They have given .the Baron a
swelled head and he thinks he can 'insult
any woman.' The Baron and his brother
had ruined tha hotel and they could
have it."
The witness said that Mr. Leake asked
how the Baron had ruined it, and General
Warfield used plain English in his char
acterization of the manner in which the
Baron had acted.
"Who were the people who had been
driven away from the hotel?" asked Ma
guire. ,
"I have no names as to those. The
only indication here is a note of an elder
ly lady and her two daughters who were
persecuted by the Baron. He would fol
low them through the grounds, bob up
from behind rose bushes, and In various
ways make himself obnoxious; until final
ly they left the hotel."
"Was the article published as you
wrote it?" Â£ _ . ,
"It was modified somewhat I had
been rather harsher with â¢ the de
fendant and the copy reader made some
changes."
Mrs. Warfleld Interviewed.
Prank L. Perkins was called. He testi
fied that he was the San Rafael corre
spondent of The Call on and_-before Oc
tober 25, 1899.
"Did you have an interview with Mrs.
Warfleld?" asked Attorney Preston.
"Yes. sir."
"In the Hotel RafaeL"
"Who were present?"
"Mrs. Warneld, General Warfleld and
myself." â¢ ,,
"What did you communicate to Mr.
Leake concerning that Interview?"
"I told Mr. Leake that Mrs. Warfleld
had told me that the General would try to
get a release from the hotel lease; that
the Baron's conduct had been notorious
for months. Ho had insulted women, and
his conduct with o'yher women whom he
could not insult was such as to scandalize
respectable women. His conduct had not
been confined to the hotel, but had ex
tended to roadside resorts, his associates
being guests at the hotel."
Maguire objected to testimony regarding
conduct away from the hotel. The court
Bald the conduct alleged occurred In the
vicinity of the hotel and the testimony
was admissible.
â¢â¢She named only one resort, the Fair-,
fax Villa. Bhe said he had taken guests
there. She had remonstrated with him
concerning his carousals, and he said he
was running his own hotel. Servants had
told her that he and his companions
passed whole nights in gambling. At one
time some of them had sat up all night
gambling. She had caused a servant to
watch them and had told the Baron that
her husband could not permit gaming in
the hotel. She had told Baron von
Bchrceder that such conduct must cease.
She did not believe it would cease, as she
did not believe the leopard could change
"Did you inform Mr. Leaks what Gen
eral Warfleld had said?"
"I told him that he sat quietly and of
fered no objections."
Questions framed to call forth testi
mony showing the absence of malice on
the part of himself and Mr. Leake were
objected to by Judge Maguire. The court
ruled that the witness might testify as
to the instructions given him by Mr.
Leake.
"He told me," said the witness, "not
to send over anything until the lease of
the hotel should be given up. When that
should happen my story would have been
verified, and I should notify him." Â¦
"Did he ask you anything else?"
"I told him I had myself been at a party
at Fairfax Villa, where the Baron, his
brother and others from the hotel were
"What dld >( you tell Mr. Leake had hap

The question was objected to by Ma
guire, Preston wanted to ask witness to
give -what had happened as direct testi
mony, but that was not Â¦ allowed, and
Preston returned to his original question,
the court permitting it to be answered.
The witness said:

"Did you sent Mr. Leake any word on

"I sent him word that I understood that
the lease was to be given up the fol

couJd be seen at the California Hotel."
Adjournment was taken to 10:15 o'clock

Miss Ackerman dwelt especially upon

THE PACIFIC COAST WOMEN'S PRESS ASSOCIATION.
"He said the Baron frequently followed
women through the grounds, ogled women
from the veranda and had even been ac
cused of Indecent exposure. One case he
told of, that of a young woman who he
was convinced came there a virtuous wo
man, anJ was ruined by the Baron. She
was susceptible to flattery, in which the
Baron was a past master. The Baron had
Past master in Flattery.
"General Warneld admitted that he was
to surrender the lease of the Hotel Ra
fael." said the witness. "He stated that
guests had complained repeatedly of the
Baron's conduct and on frequent occa
sions there had been 6candal. General
Warfleld said that it was Baron von
Schroeder's custom to have girls and
young matrons introduced to him. He
mentioned one case. The Baron frequent
ly entertained a young married woman,
who invited other young lady guests.
Some of these were guests at the hotel,
others were from the outside.
Maguire objected, but the court over
ruled him on the ground that Buch state
ment was evidence in mitigation.
Maguire asked if the notes were War
field's complete statement. Witness said
they were not, but were catch notes to
refresh his memory, with occasional verb
atim quotations. The court ruled that the
use of the notes by the witness was al
lowable.
IÂ»nghand notes were handed witness
and he identified them. Colonel Preston
instructed him not to mention any names
of women written in the notes, and cau
tioned him repeatedly not by any inad
vertence to use those names in his testi
mony.
"Tell what took place at that inter
view."
"What part did you take in the inter
view?"
"I took notes of General Warfiejd's
statements."
"I was."
"Were you present at an interview on
October 24. 1SS9, between Mr. Leake and
Genera! Warneld?" asked Preston.
Reporter Tells of Interview.
"It was since that time that you have
ceased to be on speaking terms with the
Mayor?"
"Yes. I have met the Mayor only a
few times."
"How long have you known General
Warneld?"
"Four or five years, I presume. I was
a member of the National Guard, and
met him in that capacity."
"Have you met him frequently eince
October 24. 1SS9?"
"Yes, frequently. We belong 1 to the
same club, and I meet him there often."
"You had no personal knowledge of the
facts published In the article?"
"None."
Witness was excused, and W. H. Ray
mond was called.
"I met him on the street. If anything
was said about this matter it was
brought up by him. and was casual. Our
con\'ersation was of politics."
"Did you meet Phelan or have any con
versation with him anywhere prior to
the election?"
"I certainly would."
"Did you have a conversation with Ma
yor Phelan on or about the 26th of Oc
tober in reference to the publication of
this editorial, in a room or stall in the
basement or under the Phelan building?"
"I did not. I have not been on speak
ing terms with Mayor Phelan for tome
time."
"Would you have recollected such a
conversation?"
"I do not remember that I did."
"No. There may* have been a man of
that name employed in some one of the
depar tmants. "
"Did you have an Interview with Mr.
Spreckels in regard to this story before
its publication in the presence of a third
person?"
Preston withdrew his objection and the
editorial became a part of the evidence
in the case.
"You Bay Mr. Bpreckels was at or near
Salinas City on the night of October 24,
1S33," said Magnlre. "When did hÂ« re
turn to San Francisco?"
"My recollection is that he returned on
the afternoon of October 25- I am not
positive as to the date,"
"Did you talk to him about the article
published by you the- morning of the
25th?"
"I did."
"Had you a reporter on the paper
named McGee?"
Judge Angellottl perused the editorial,
which asserted it to be the sacred duty
of a newspaper to expose vice which af

proposed to read the Bulletin article
and Preston objected that there was no
evidence in to show that Warneld had
written the letter, and the court ruled
that plaintiff's counsel was not entitled
to read the latter at that time.
Maguire oifered a clipping of an edl
orial published in The Call October 26,
lÂ£Vy. Witness said it was published on
his authority. Counsel offered it In evi
dence to show malice, its publication hav
ing followed the publication of the Bul
letin denial. Preston objected on the
ground that no reference was made to the
plaintiff in the editorial.
"Did you see a letter written by General
Warfield and published in the Bulletin
October 25, 1833, denying the truth of the
article in The Call?"

"Not entirely. I had Mr. Perkins' state
ment of his interview with Mrs. War

"Who Is this Perkins on whose state
ment you relied"
"He was our regular San Rafael cor
respondent."
"Mr. Raymond, you say, wrote the ar
ticle alleged to be libelous?"
"He wrote the original article from his
notes. It passed through the hands of the
copy readers and may have been trimmed
and objectionable matter eliminated."
"Did you confer with Mr. Spreckels con
cen.ing Mr. Perkins' information before
>our Interview with General Warfield?"
"I do not remember to have done so. I
may have mentioned it casually."
"Your decision to publish the story was
due solely to General Wartteld's state
ments?"
"He stated that the Baron took no pains
whatever to cover them up; that he rather
took pride in flaunting them."
Witness had no acquaintance with
Baron von Schroeder and had had no
dealings with him.
"Where was the defendant, John r>.
Spreckels, at this timer'
The question called up objections from
plalntifi's counsel, which were overruled,
and the witness replied:
"He was at the Salinas sugar factory."
"Did he have any knowledge, of what
was to be published?"
"None whatever."
Defendant's counsel surrendered the wit
ness. .
"What is your exact position on The
Call?" asked Maguire.
"I am manager."
"You have direction of both the editorial
and the business departments?"
"I do not assume sole direction. I con

"Did you authorize this publication

spectable girl, he believed, and had been
ruined by the Baron. He said he had the
reputation of running: a respectable hotel
and he could not afford to lose that repu

brother had ruined the good name of the
Hotel Rafael and they could take It and
keep it."
"i>id he make any statement concern
ing* plaintiff and his wife?"
"Speaking about the hotel becoming un
prontable, he said that the Baron and his
wife had formerly stayed there during
the winter months. She had later gone to
Germany. Some question of a woman
came up and he could not leave to join her
until it was settled. He said the Baron
had squandered much of his fortune, and
maia particular mention of bonds of the
Donahue Railroad that he had sold."
"What effect did General Warneld's
statements have upon you?"
"I believed they were true or I would
not have published the article. I gave ex

interview."

holders. The culmination of a rise invariably
presents this very condition, but lt is a con
dition which occurs also at intervals In any
long FUFtalned upward movement. The con-
Fervatlve clement after seeing a certain profit
r^currd rr.aies it a habit to 6*11 and take
profits regardless of the prospects of a further
advance. The weight of Influence then passes
to the bear party and the upward course is
not renewed until they have exhausted their
best efforts to rush the reaction to a culmina
tion. What was evident to-day was that pow
erful skillful manipulation was at work to
make the opening prices as high as possible
to meet the flood of outside buying orders

enorrcous realizing was In evidence. Later In
the day very earnest attempts to hold up the
market by marking up the price of various
individual stocks, and as the fact became more
and more evident that the sustaining force of
these individual movements was taken advant
age of to continue the unloading of heavy lines
of long stock the professional element on the
Exchange turned to the bear side. They were
successful in forcing a sharp reaction, much
reducing the rains that had been largest and
completely wiping out a large number of those
that had only reached moderate proportions.
Manipulation dex-eloped at the clote again to
rally the market by bidding up Northern Pa
cific to 78Vfcâ a record price. The shorts were
buying to cover elsewhere so that the closing
was generally steady with the further coursa
of the market very unsettled and doubtful.
KvÂ«?n with the net changes In prices to-day
very email the profits on last week's advances
are on en enormous scale. To-day's animated
outburst of outside speculation was the logical
consequence of last week's events. The pal
pable fact that large banking and financial in
terests were taking on enormous lines of vari
ous stocks axid the development* of the week
pointing to far-reaching plans and the Im
provement of values waa offset for a time
by the apparently dangerous condition of the
meney market against the natural drain In Us

CHICAGO, Deo. 17. â Corn again took prece
dence on the Board of Trade to-day and was
strong and higher from the start. The unset
tled weather conditions, rendering still more
uncertain any increase in the contract stocks
and the total absence of contract corn in to
day's arrivals of 547 cars, revived anxiety
among shorts, who became active bidders for
both December and May as the session pro
gressed. Chief interest centered in the Decem
ber option. This was bid up very rapidly by
one prominent broker who is credited with be
ing heavily short, the price reaching 39%c be
fore the reaction came. Even at that figure
there was little offered for sale. The decrease
in the vjsible supply of 624,000 bushels helped
the bull situation. May In the meantime also
showed considerable strength, though having
periods of comparative depression. December
closed 2%c higher at 2S&c. May closed *jo
higher at SCVic.
Wheat was inclined to be weak early in the
session. Lower cables, world" s receipts of
about a million larger than expected and a
large Increase on I passage had a depressing
effect on bulls and the market for some time
appeared to be utterly without support. Open-
Ing Uo lower at 72%@7So May sold at 72%@
72%c for thÂ» first hour of trading. Up to about
11 o'clock the market continued heavy and ap
parently barren of buyers, but a hardening
tendency appeared soon after, prospects of de
crease in the visible and the strength of corn
bringing good support. During the last hoiir
the market was dull but quite firm, and all
the early loss waa recovered. May advanced to
73 J ,Jc and closed at that price.
Oats were dull from start to finish, business
being confined entirely to professionals. May
closed a shade higher at 23%@23%o.
Provisions were dull and easy early, heavy
hog receipts causing a general decline in prices.
Lard and Dork were offered quite freely, with
few. takers. Toward the end the market im
proved, shorts coming into the market and
prices recovering somewhat. January . pork

. NEW YORK, Dec 17.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were fairly active to-day,
but they were more or less affected by a heavy
slump in West Australian mines, which may
lead to severe trouble in the market. Amer
icans were buoyant and, active, closing excited
at the top, although the dealings were still
mainly professional. Favorites were Northern
Pacifies, Atchlsons, Southern and Erie pre
ferred. There vru no initiative here, only im
plicit acceptance of New York tips. New York
sold Anacondas, disheartening operations here,
but to the surprise of every one they bought
Argentines and Brazilians. ThÂ« Bank of Eng
land got Â£150,000 g-old from South Africa and
lost Â£180.000 to an unstated destination. Fort
nightly copper statistics show stocks increased
S45 tons and supplies decreased 430 tons.

"Here," he said, "Is a big bill for soda
water. ' Was that used for construction
or for operating purposes?"
The witness replied that the soda wa
ter was posted to the construction ac
count and explained that it was used in
resuscitating the small boys who were
sent into the asphalt-covered pipes to
scrape them out. The sun's rays beating
on the pipes generated noxious gases and
the boys had to be hauled out by a rope
attached to one leg and soused with soda
pop to revive them.
Another item attracted the attorney's
suspicious attention. "Arsenic, forty dol
lars," he read. "Was that put into the
water for the consumers?"
The poison. It was explained, was used
to kill gophers and squirrels operating
near the company's dams and reservoirs
The examination was repeatedly inter
rupted by the company's lawyers, who
had to be repeatedly quashed by the
court during the day's proceedings.
President Watkinson was put on the
stand by the city for cross-examination.
It was Judge Hayne's purpose to get his
testimony on the statements furnished
the City Council by the water company.
The admissiblllty of this line of cross
questioning was fiercely assailed by the
company's attorneys. Judge Hayne main
tained that he waa at liberty to put to
the witness questions suggested by the
city's expert on the reports which the
witness had admitted preparing and
which he had testilled were correct. These
reports, he contended, were pertinent to
the statements of Watklnson previously
made regarding the money spent on con
struction in each year. The court decided
to allow the questions. Hayne then went
over the Hems contained in the report
for 1SS6. r
To-day's hearing of the water rate case
was taken up with an attempt to supple
ment from President Watklnson's mem
ory the accounts at hand bearing on the
cost of constructing the company^ plant.
The company first, however, attempted a
little surprise along the same lino by re
calling Expert Kiersted, who was dismiss
ed from the case last- week, and trying
to oiler In evidence some of the docu
ments from which his data were deduced.
Judge Hayne objected to the admission
of the evidence and the court sustained
him.

"Every thoughtful Christian knows
that it Is true when I say that only 5

darken the doors of the church from one
year's end to another."
Such was Secretary Noel H. Jacks' re
mark In the course of a farewell address
to the Young Men's Christian Associa

"I find in my own work that the num

in Ingersoll, spiritualism and material

"The census of l%0 reports for our
country a population of 10,000,000 young
men under thirty years of age. These
young men are to shape our politics, give
color to our education and give charac

said: 'The destiny of any nation at any
time depends upon the opinions of the
young men who are under twenty-nve
years of age.' If this be true, then young
manhood is occupying a place of supreme
importance. It is also true that in that
fact there is great danger to our land

BERKELEY, Dec. 17.â Preliminary ac
tion was taken by the Town Trustees to
njght for the repeal of the present pro
hibition law. An ordinance waa passed
to print providing for. the granting of 11-^
censes for saloons. Vigorous opposition'
was made by the temperance people to
the ordinance. ' The meeting was closed
by the Trustees hurling charges of hypoc
risy and deceit at each other amid great
excitement. ,'. /"y;.>r.
Five hundred Berkeley residents attend
ed the meeting, and nearly three hours
were occupied by different temperance
people addressing the board. The vote at
the close of the discussion was:
Ayes â Staats, Dowd, - HofC and Marston.
Noesâ Le Conte, Turner and Frame.
After the vote had been taken Turner
changed from the negative to the aftTkn
atlve and gave notice of reconsideration.
The license ordinance provides for a li
cense of $75 a quarter, an increase of $25
over the last saloon ordinance. To se
cure a license the petitioner must have
the signatures of the five citizens near
est his place of business. A special clause
is introduced which makes It Impossible
to grant licenses to women. Trustee E.
O. Turner opened the discussion against
the new ordinance. He said:
"We cannot afford to go on record as
letting those men run oyer us and defy
our court and our, laws."
"The temperance orfllnance cannot be
enforced." said President W. H. Marston.
"The best case we had was lost last week
and the Jury was only out five minutes."
"Liquor is sold openly. We propose to
settle this matter in a businesslike way,"
said Trustee -Hoff..- Â¦ .
Trustee Staats, said: .
"My vote shall be cast the only proper
wnyYo regulate this > evil." _
The 'following people spoke against the
repeal: Mrs. Adelaide Marquand, Mrs. R.
M. Rhodes. J. L. Barker, L. Coryelle,
H Fisher, O. G. May. Charle3 Hadlen
spoke for the repeal. At the close of the
meeting the temperance people : crowded
around Trustee Turner to congratulate
him on the stand he had taken. Presi
dent Marston. after viewing the proceed
ings for some time suddenly exclaimed:
"They are all congratulating you,, but
you are in a business where you don't
dare to express*. your opinions. I am an
independent man. I can vote" according
to my ' convictions." â¢
"I don't blame Mr. Turner," said Hoff.
"He's a poor business man who Is striv
ing to keep up his end. But he hasn't
any right to be on this board If he can't
vote according to his convictions." .
"I call this gentleman to order," ex
claimed Turner. ' "I demand; protection
from the board." â¢ _,. , â â
"You are a hypocrite, cried Hoff. "You
said this temperance Â¦ Â¦ ordinance was a
farce, and now you vote to uphold It.
You have a - legal right on this board,
but morally you; don't belong here."

THE Lindsay exhibit, famous
throughout the State as an expo
sition of the capacity of Tulare
County for growing high grade
citrus fruits, has been located at
the ferry building at the foot of Market
street. Yesterday fifteen hundred lemons
and oranges were attached to a huge de
sign of a centrifugal pump that stanos
seventeen feet high and Is supported by
a table twenty-two feet by twelve feet l*i
dimensions. Coupled with the pump is a
design of an electric motor, which is also
decorated with oranges and lemons. These
designs are the central feature of the ex
hibit, but there is an excellent display of
citrus fruits upon the table. Over tho
whole are the words "Lindsay" and "Tu
iare County,", thus announcing to the
crowds of people who pass by dally the
locality where the fruit grew.
The fruits used In the decoration of the
pump and motor are tangarlnes, lemons,
pomolos and Washington navels, which
First the East Oakland power house
was closed, and turned Into a car house.
Then the power house on Grove street
in Temescal was closed and rented to the
Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Company,
which is using It for a power house to
supply Its electric lighting plant for
Berkeley. Now the Alameda power house
has been closed, but the machinery, will
be allowed to remain and It will bemused
as a reserve or emergency plant.
This will cause a great saving In labor,
for one crew at the Piedmont power house
can keep the entire system supplied with
electrical power. Po^r from the Pied
mont plant Is now carried from Berke
ley through Oakland, West Oakland. Ala
meda, Highland Park and out to Leona
Heights.
The Oakland Transit Company Is nego
tiating with the Standard Electric Com
pany for power whtn the latter corpora
tion gets Its plant at the Blue Lakes in
working order. The Standard Electric
Company already has a contract to sup
ply the Oakland Railroad system on San
Pablo and Telegraph avenues, and If It
gets the Oakland Transit Company's lines
It will operate everything in Oakland ex
cept the Haywards line.
Two additional cars have been put on
the Alameda line and other Improvements
are under consideration at the request of
the Oakland Council.
One by one the many different power
stations of the Oakland Transit Company
have been closed. When the Transit Com
pany was formed out of some' eight dif
ferent lines It found Itself with
four different power houses filled with
expensive machinery and as many differ
ent car houses as there were lines that
had been absorbed. This meant the spend
ing of a large amount of money for oper
ation of the different power plants and a
large amount of money for taxes upon
the car houses. Manager Kelly deter
mined that he would consolidate every
thing at the Piedmont power house, this
being the most central and commodious
of the many plants on the company's
hands.
The Oakland Transit Company has
taken the final step in its general scheme
for the concentration of its power plants,
and last night the power house of the
Alameda branch at the West End. Ala
meda, was closed down. From now on
the entire system will be served from the
power house at Piedmont.

public-spirited men in Tulare County have
shared the expense of the Installing and
maintenance of the exhibit in the ferry
building. The design originated with
Charles J. Carle of Lindsay and was de
veloped by Mrs. W. T. Simms and S. A.
Baggs and wife. When exhibited at the
San Joaquln Citrus Fair at Tulare from
November 28 to December 2 of the present
year It took first and second prizes over
all competitors for "best display of citrus
fruits." \
Thousands or persons will view the ex
hibit daily here. The display Is made pos
sible by the co-operation of the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners and tho
State Board of Trade. There are now 2000
acres planted to citrus fruits in Tulare
County, where there were only wheat
fields eight years ago. The county will
ship out of the State this year 600 car
loads of citrus fruit of as fine quality as
California has ever produced. It Is
claimed that oranges ripen in Tulare
County two weeks to one month earlier
than In otner portions of the State.

felling them in San Francisco. The girl
loomed up In the affair so strongly that
after the case reached the Superior Court
evidence upon which Gutting was held for
trial faded away and the District Attor

of the Information. Judge Greene granted
the motion, but. from the bench, his Hon

and fcer figure, always attractive, has lost

and, as with anything that the only Fer
ris touches, a highly original "mix-up"
is the result. Perhaps the funniest feat
ure of all is the timely travesty of "Car
men"â "Collar-a-Cannen," In which tho
comedian himself does the Spanish fas
cinator, a la Collamarina. with a simply
gnft-geous humor. Edward Webb sketches
the favorite little tenor Russo in cleverly
comic fashion, and the lengthy RIchardJ
Is an amazing Mlchaela. The performance
was Interlarded freely with references to
"one-night" stands and other hits at tho
Alhambra mishaps of the week and waa
greeted throughout with roars of laugh -
The picturesque side of the show has
been amply taken care of by Oscar L.
Fest and there are ballets galore, new an.l
pretty. A dance of frogs and a dog and cat
hop delighted the children, and two tiny,
real Arabian cream-colored ponies drew
Cinderella's pumpkin chariot across tha
stage in sumptuous fashion.
Cinderella herself. MlsÂ» Mae Hill, mada
her debut last evening as a star and mad.j
a most favorable Impression. Maude Wil
liams is a shapely and handsome Prince
Peerless and Annie Myers has a grateful
part as Dandinl. the valet. The wicked
sisters were splendidlv done by Tom
Greene and Fred Kavanagh. and Maggie
Levy was a good "bad stepmother.
Ferris Hartman's chief part is Buttons,
a Hartman Innovation in the storyâ and
one wonders "how it never happened be
fore? He has some good songs, very
good, and one or two poor ones. Edwar'l
Webb has the other comedy part as tho
Baron Boozmont, and adds much to thÂ»
fun oÂ£Â« the show.
"Cinderella" Is certainly booked for a
long run, and Is an ell-round creditable
show. It needs cutting in places, but
went last night with unusual smoothness
for a first-night affair.
'Tis the week before Christmas and aJl
through the town, not a show that's
a-stirring is worth half-a-crownâ except
"Madame Butterfly." which i3 now enter
ing upon the" third week of a well-de
served success at the Alcazar. Miss Cros
by has improved considerably upon her
rendition of the first week; in many Places
where she formerly succeeded in attain
ing only odd effects, she now attains ef
fects that are truly pathetic. Mr. Mon
taine and Mr. Scott, as Yamaxlori and ths
American Consul, respectively, are now
thoroughly up In their parts and get a
great deal more out of them than they,Qla
on the first night
The play as & whole is so much superior
to the ordinary run of theatrical attrac
tions" (poor word!) that one Is safe In
recommending it. even to the most fastidi
ous, as well worth seeing once. It. no.
Nothing of this kind can bo said for
the farce, "A Serious Tangle." which
this week precedes "Madame Butterfly.
There is a gleam of originality in the
central motive, according to which the
action Is pushed along and the compli
cations are brought about through the
instrumentality of a character who Is
really ignorant of facts which everybody
else in the play knows. But this gleam is
obscured by the dullness of the treat
mentâmuch talk, little action and no tell
ing lines.
Mr. Henderson, the new leading man.
who will be favorably remembered for his
excellent acting with Mr. Royle In
"Friends." worked hard at his- part, but
you cannot squeeze juice out of a dry
lemon, and "A Serious Tangle" 13 not
only dry but is also desiccated.
Miss Stockwell had the only tolerabla
woman's partâ that of a slavey. But she
never let you feel for a moment that this
was a real slavey; you felt rather that
this was a lady playing a slavey. That
kind of art went out with Madam* Ves
trtrâand is not worth reviving.
I cannot believe, moreover, that Sydney
Grunsy ever wrote "That tangle 1%
stopped." You can no more stop a tangle
, than you can tangle a stop. Mr. Bryant
Is mentioned on the programme as re
sponsible for the stage direction; to him,
therefore, I commend for unmixing this
choicest of mixed metaphors^^

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Dec. 17.
The Bankers' Association ot the United
States has commenced an investigation
of the recent find by the Oakland police
of Burglar Clarence French's remarkable
collection of electrical implements which
were to be used in an attempt to force
the vault of the California Bank in this
city. Through the medium of the Pinker
ton Detectivo Agency the association has
taken steps to have the discovery of the
tools and all of the evidence surround
ing that extraordinary sAte-cracicing ex
periment transmitted to every bank in
the country with wnich the association
has affiliations, uhis move Is unusual ana
has deeii taken to properly inform linan
clers that they may guard against this
up-to-aaie method of oreaklng into their
strong boxes.
Special attention was called to the
French equipment because of the excel
lent photographic reproductions of the kit
whlcn were rrtade by The Call. Agents
of the Pinkertons began their Inquiries
to-day by making application to Chief of
Police Hodgkins for descriptions of the
tools and wires, together with copies of
the photographs, the negatives of wh'.cn
were made for The Call.
The outnt was complete in every par
ticular for the work which thcÂ» burglar de
signed, namely, to melt by electrical cur
rent the steel covering of the vault. The
tools, wires, etc.. were so handily ar
ranged that electricians who examined
the paraphernalia declared it would have
been successful but for some un
foreseen obstacle. The current for the
carbon point was to have been obtained
from wires connected with an elevator
motor in the Masonic Turjple block, in
which the California Bank is located.
Since the police made public their find
some aditlonal facts have Deen brought to
lieht wlhch indicate hew near to the move
was the bold electrical bucglar. He had
borÂ«d holes through the partition sep
arating the. bank rooms from the elevator
well and had everything ready to make
his connections.
Electricians estimate that the burglar
could have 'melted down th*> obstructing
steel in twenty minutes and then have
removed the combination lock and freed
the bolts and bars of the massive door.
There is no burglary of that character of
record in the police books of the United
States.- Some time ago the German police
had an experience with the method, which
was successfully operated In a Berlin
bank.

Its Healthy Growth,
It is believed by laymen and profes
sional hairdressers that cutting largely
Increases the growth of the hair. This
belie* begins with the Involuntary com
parison of the hair with a plant. As grass
that la often cut short grows again and
becomes thicker, so, it is believed, the
hair should do when it is cut. This com
parison, however. Is a false one. A devel
oped hair is a perfectly formed mass of
horn which has .nothing further to do
with the case in which the hair rests than
to receive from it from below further
growth and to be. held firmly by . it.
In this mass of horn, as in the nails of
the. fingers and the toes, there is no lon
ger any sap in circulation: this mass, so
to speak, is a product which cannot be
quickened and strengthened by new nour
ishment, because the latter cannot enter
it. On the other hand, what happens in
a blade of grass is totally different. The
blade of grass is a network of fine ducta
in which, is constantly circulating the
nourishment which the blade draws from
the root; It presents, in contrast with the
dead boÂ«ly of the hair, a living, vegetating
substance which has a most intimate
connection' with the condition of its
root, and which dries up infallibly when
It Is eeparated from its root, while the
hair will remain- unaffected for thousands
of years after its papilla has withered
away. We need cite only one irresistible
proof of this, the hair on the heads of
mummies. â¢ The root of the hair as Ions
as it exists can produce a new hair when
the old hair has fallen out, while the root
of f many a plant gives existence to one
pprout only and then together with it de
clines and dies. The more a hair is dis
turbed in Its natural growth by con
tinually cutting off its ends the less rest
Its papilla, the real producer of the hair,
finds; the papilla, being constantly Incited
to excessive production, wavers finally In
its activity, decays and dies. For thl3
reason a woman with a bald head is never
or seldom Been, as the natural and very
slow process of the growth of a woman's
hair Is not disturbed. The individual hair
reaches a definite length; after years it
falls out' of Itself, and a new hair, begins
to appear as soon as the papilla has nad
time to rest itself thoroughly and to pre
pare for the process of a new growth.
These are the reasons which lead to the
obviously , valid conclusion - that cutting
the hair is rather injurious than usefuLâ

There were only two arrivals up to sun

breaking bar. The schooners James A.
Garfleld and Free Trade both sailed for
Gray's Harbor and the transport Thomas
sailed for Manila, via Honolulu.
The steamships \ Bureka, "Walla Walla,

A rising barometer told all the shippers
that clear weather .was probable, . so all
hands took the chanceo and went out.
It is now known that it was not the
Kosmos liner Neko that was in collision
with the Crown of Scotland, but the col
lier Washtenaw. The latter was without
a pilot and following the Neko In, mistook
her bearings and crashed into the stern
of the sailing ship. The collier has gone
to sea, but an inquiry will be held on
her return.

Pomona in Heavy weather.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Pomona, which arrived from Eureka yes
terday, had a hard time on the Humboldt
bar and at one time the passengers
thought she was Agoing down. Doors- of
staterooms were torn from Â¦ their hinges,
cabins were flooded, the" forecastle and
"glory hole" were gutted and minor dam
age was done. One big sea struck the
stout little steamer on the starboard quar
ter and nearly burled her. Another swept
the social hall and a few of the passen
gers were hurt, but ' not seriously. 'It
was a record trip for the Pomona, and
those who came down on her do not want
to repeat the experience.
OVERDUE SHIPS BEINSTJRED.
THE storm of last Friday has made
a lot of trouble for shipping 1 . Some
vessels It drove off shore and oth
ers it brought right up to the
Golden Gate, but a breaking bar
prevented their entrance. Some of them
took a tow and came In through, the north
channel, but the majority of the captains
preferred to stand on and off and take
chances on sailing. in.
At sundown yesterday there were In the
