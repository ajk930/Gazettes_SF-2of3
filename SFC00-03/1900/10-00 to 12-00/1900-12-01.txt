THOMAS PEDLER. A GLASS
WORKS VICTIM, WHOSE
EPINE IS FRACTURED.
S, AN FRANCISCO passed
yesterday a day and a
nl/g-bt of sorrow. The hor
' 'ror'of tfceÂ»5readful acd
i dent on Thanksgiving day
f wu upon, the people, and
everywhere there was the
sign of sadness and gloom.
Hour by hour the terrible
roll of death was Increas
ing. New homes were being stricken by
the reaper of lives, and new families were
feelisr its etern personal anguishâ the
force cf the calamity which had come
with such . horrifying suddenness. The
hospitals were crowded by anxious men
tnd women. The streets In the neighbor
hood of the Morgue were black with
preat masses of humanity, and in many
private homes hundreds of sympathetic
people went to give their sympathy to
the. f&xnUles which were in sorrow. The
dead now number eighteen, five men and
boys hating died during the day.
The roll of the injured has been ln
cre&sefl to eighty-flve. Many of these
have been injured for life; some will lose
their limbs a&d a few will p-obably die.
The catastrophe was one which has in
spired the authorities of the city with a
This statement is corroborated by Pom
eroy and Duval, both of whom have been
seen by the police. Strong as this state
ment, is, it la not, however, conclusive
evidence that anybody in' authority ; i?ef
mltted the unfortunate victims '. of the
tragedy to. enter. the grounds. . That. the
gate on Harrison street- was open there
seems to be no question, but that, hun
dredsof people clambered over the fences
is equally certain. The police ; complain

Bponsibility for the dread affair they; have
not been assisted by the management of
the San Francisco and Pacific ' Glass
In the police investigation several other
significant facts have been discovered.
W. J. McGrevy, of 703^ Valencia street,
declares that In company with William
Pomeroy and J. L. Duval he stood . near
the Harrison-street gate of the Inclosure
and watched the progress of a most pecu
liar Incident. He insists that before the
football game began this Harrison-street
gate was opened Just far enough to per
mit one man at a time to go through.' A
long line of men standing in single file
led from this opening, McGrevy says, and
one by one the men passed through, each
putting his hand in his pocket as if -to
pay some money to a' person who stood
within the gate and whom McGrevy could
not see.
It is significant that the owners of the
San Francisco and Pacific Glass Works
had made an agreement with the man
agers of the football team not to permit
any one to enter the grounds. In consid
eration for not doing this members of the
company were given six complimentary
tickets. Only two persons have thus far
been found who declare that they paid
any money, for admission into the inclos
ure. One of these is a boy, Clarence Ehat,
residing at 709 Post street, who declares
that he paid half a dollar to be allowed
to pass through the gate and onto the
roof from which he fell. The other is
Howard Palmer, who lives at 299 Hyde
street, and declares that after climbing
over the fence of the inclosure be paid
ten cents for permission to go upon tht
roof.
to enter. Believing this. Captain Seymour
detailed four men yesterday to make a
thorough Investigation of the affair. De
leeiire* Wren, Dlnan.:Graha~m*'and"KlFz^
gerald visited the various hospitals and
interrogated everybody who might throw
any light on the subject.
The officers went to the County Hospital
and questioned sixteen of the victims of
the catastrophe who. were there. The
majority of these crippled, suffering men
and boys declared that they had" entered
through the Harrison-street gate of the
inclosure of the San Francisco and Pa
ciflc Glass Works and that no one maJe
the Blightest objection to their entrance.
Two boys declared that they, in company
with twenty others, attempted to climb
over, the Fifteenth-street fence but were
driven away by policemen. One of the
most important statements obtained by
the detectives was from Watchman Open
&haw who was on guard within the in
closure.
He declared that he admitted two
women and several men on passes issued
by . Superintendent Davis of the' glass
1 works. Openshaw also said that there
were only two watchmen -besides himself
employed at the Harrison-street gate and
only one at the Fifteenth-street gate.
William Meyers, a saloon man at Six
teenth and Folsom streets, declared that
he had heard people say that men and
boys had been admitted to the grounds
for twenty-five cents and fifty cents
apiece. This statement, however, has not
been verified.
Tlie horror of the accident at the San Francisco and Pacific
Glass Works has left a profound impression upon the people of the
city. The dread roll of the dead has been increased to eighteen, five
mots victims having succumbed yesterday to their wounds. Six
nore men are so desperately injured that it is feared they may
at any n>OTneTÂ»t die. The number of injured is now eighty-five,
most of whom, will be maimed and scarred for life.
ThÂ« police authorities ate making every possible endeavor to
fix responsibility for the catastrophe. Three men have been discov
ered *Â¦"<< swear that men. and boys entered the enclosure in single
file through one of the gates and acted as if they were paying for
admission. Two boys declare that they did pay, one for admission
to the enclosure and the other for permission to ascend to the roof.
At the inquest n*xt Tuesday every effort will be made to fix the
blara* where it belongs.

There is grave doubt of the boy's recov

PAID A LARGE BILL
WITH A BOGUS CHECK
Young Oaston Must Face Two Very-
Serious Charges of
Forgery.
Louis Gaston. a young man who re
cently arrived from the East, was ar
rested by Policeman George Douglass on
a charge of forgery yesterday afternoon.
The complaining witness is R. G. Wllke,
a real estate agent at 26V4 Kearny street.
Wllke alleges .that Gaston gave him a
bogus check for 11050. Part of the money
was to have been paid on a real estate
transaction, and, as Gaston demanded
the balance In change, an additional
charge of obtaining money under faise
pretenses was placed' against him.
Some time ago Gaston requested the
real estate man to purchase a business
for him, and Wilke finally succeeded in
procuring a half interest In a restaurant
conducted by M. F. Waferling at 410
Kearny street. Gaston during this trans
action flashed a large check, and on the
statement that he had plenty of money
Wilke loaned him small sums from -ime
to time.
Finally a settlement was ordered and
Gaston presented a check for |m>50 signed
by C. B. Howendobler. The amount of
the sale was $650, and the purchaser asiced
him to give him the difference, in cash.
Wllke had always known his patron un
der the name of Gaston and was surprised
when he saw another name on the paper.
This Gaston explained by saying that he
used various names in business transac-
tions. '
Wtlke took the check to the Bank of
Commerce, on which it had been drawn,
and found it to be worthless. He then
sent for Gaston and called Policeman
Douglass, who made the arrest. â¢
Who Howendobler is the police do not
know positively. Gaston claims, however,
that he is in existence and that he gave
him permission to use bis name. If any
person of that name Is connected .with
the transaction it is certain that he has
no deposit in the bank specified In the
check.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
recommended to the board yesterday that
the demand for $725 presented by the Sec
retary of State for baliot paper furnished
to this city and countv for the last elec
tion be cut from $725 to $362 50. By this
action the committee r-ustains the Mayors
veto of the demand on the eround that
it was exorbitant. Tho three members of
the committee â Supervisors Brandenstein,
Comte and Tobinâ were thoroughly con
vinced that the charge of 12 SO per ream
or 12V* cents a pound was excessive. Af
ter an exhaustive Investigation, at which
the testimony of several paper ex
perts was heard, it was concluded that
Price Charged by # Secretary
of State Is Cut in Half
by Committee.

Judge Wallace's Suit for
Services Rendered Ready
: for Trial.
- t Â¦ -
A jury has been selected to try the
issues involved in the action Instituted
by ex-Judge William T. Wallace and Ry
land B. Wallace against Drury Melone to
recover JS1S3 33 for legal services in con
nection with the sale of Placervllle. bonds.
The prominence of the litigants and the
suggestions of " bribery In the Legisla
ture, Incorporated In the answer and
cross complaint of the defendant, attract
ed a large and curious audience to the
courtroom.
Judge Wallace and his son were repre
sented by E.-S. Pillsbury and J. C. Camp

and Dibble represented the defendant.
The venire- 'summoned Â¦ by Sheriff Lack

forthwith.
In no way were the issues in the case
or the contentions which "will be raised
by either the plaintiffs or defendant fore
shadowed .by the questions of counsel.
Joseph Brltton, who resides at 829 Union
street, was quickly challenged ' by the
defense for cause. "I never admired Me

I did admire Wallace."
; Ex-Assessor John D. Slebe was excused
by concent on his statement -that he was
too 111 to serve, he ' having left his sick

TO TRY ACTION
AGAINST MELONE
an, endeavor was made to mulct the city
out of a large sum of money.
The most important witness before the
committee yesterday was Arthur G.
Towne of the paper firm of Blake, Mof
fitt & Towne, who testified that the price
of the paper furnished by the Zellerbach
firm was 5& cents jxt pound for small
quantities and 4 cents for large quanti
ties. â¢
"Was that the market price of. the bal
lot paper last January when it was or
dered by the Secretary of tSate?v asked
Comte.'-
"The price at that time," said Towne,
"might have been one-half cent higher per
pound, but no more." -
"What is there in the testimony given
here that it was difficult to fill the order
on account of the paper mills being
rushed?" asked Tobln.
"The order waa not filled until several
months after It was placed by the Secre
tary of State," replied Towne. "so the
mills had ample time to make the paper."
Registrar Walsh stated that he did not
receive the paper until a short time be
fore the election waa held. So this ef
fectually disposed of that plea In extenu
ation of the increased price charged by
Zellerbach.
"Assistant Secretary of Â¦ State â¢ Hoâ¬sch
quoted figures/i said "Brandensteln, "to
show that the city h.is in the past paid
more than $2 50 per ream -and as high as
$3 40. How do you account for that?"
"That is easily explained," said Towne.
"Those prices quoted by Hoesch were for
the years when paper was worth nearly
double what it is now. Four years ago
we offered to furnish liallot paper for a 1 !
cents, but the Secretary of State* ignored
us and paid 10 cents for the same paper.
We did not submit bids for paper for the
last election, as we were unaware that
any was desired." -
"Would you have furnished the same
paper for 6 cents per pound?" asked
Comte.
"We certainly would," replied Towne.
William White testified that he had gone
to Zellerbach with a sample of the ballot
paper which Zellerbach had sold to tho
State for Yi.Vi cents per pound. Zellerhach
oflVred to sell the same paper to "White
In any quantity for 6 cents per pound, -t-u
"I am In favor gf cutting down this de
mand from $2 60 per ream to \\ 25," said
Comte. The evidence Â¦ Is conclusive that
the city has been, overcharged for the
paper." - - . -
"I think the price as charged Is ex
orbitant."- said Tobln, and- Brandensteln
expressed himself in iliÂ« same, terms.
The action of the committee, which will

Special Dispatch to The Call.
GLASGOW, Nov. 30.â Owing to the con
fusion of the Identities, of two cutter
yachts the .public has. been bothered' for
the few weeks past as to which of the'two
crafts was Sir Thomas Llpton's chal
lenger. The mystery has been solved, and
it can now be stated that the new big
cutter supposed to be for the German Em
peror is for the Prince* of Wales. This
Important piece of news will cause an im
mense amount of interest here, for it is
known -that the Prince wants to help Sir
Thomas out in every way, and he will do
all that he can In the direction of aiding
Sir Thomas lift the America's cup.
When Lord Dunraven refused to fit out
the Valkyrie III as a trial horse for Sham
rock I his Royal Highness soon after put
the Britannia in commission, and he had
her raced against Upton's challenger.
What the outcome will be should the
Prince of Wales' new ship beat what is
now intended to be Shamrock II is a mat
ter of much conjecture, but a swap could
be made, as either cutter will surely come
within the terms of the conditions of the
match as agreed upon for next August.
So in case thgr royal yacht should prove
to be the faster one It would be an easy
matter to name her. Shamrock II.
The Prince of Wales will come to the
Clyde at 1 launching time, and will -be
aboard his ship during the preliminary
trials, making possibly a week's visit.
There Is a well authenticated rumor that
the Prince of Wales will visit America
and witness the next cup races. He cer
tainly wants to and will do so if he can,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PRINCETON, Ky., Nov. 30.â A mystery
which may develop Into a poisoning case
has excited this county. About ten days
ago Mrs. Cora Merrlck, wife of Frank
Merrlck filed a petition for divorce. The
petition set forth certain facts against her
husband and filed with it were deposition*
of certain witnesses to establish the fact
that Merrick was a forger and that he
had Blgned the namo of R. U. Kevil &
Sons to checks for various amount*.
On this advice warrants were sworn out
for Merrlck and he was arrested two days
later. When found at his home in this
county Merrlck either was. or pretended '
to be very ill. He was not taken, to jail,
but was allowed to remain at his horns,
under guard. On Monday he died in
agony and he was buried In the cemetery
of the little country church at BluÂ«
Springs, near his home.
Mrs. Merrick wedded James Moore yes
terday. Merrick had known his wife but
a short time when he was married to her
and their marital life was but a few
months old. They had lived happily, to
all outward appearances, till Moore came
upon the scene.
Mrs. Merrick is a beautiful woman.
Moore became Infatuated with her and
she returned his affection. Their marriage
caused much talk and an investigation
into the cause of Merrlck's death was or
dered by the officials. For the purpose of
obtaining the stomach for analysis Mer
rick's body was ordered to be exhumed.
When the grave was opened to-day the
coffin contained no body. Thi3 was a great
surprise and the police are now at work
on the case.
Merrlck has always been regarded as a
bad man. He made a detailed confession
of his forgeries to tha police soon after
he was arrested. His father has made re
imbursement for a portion of his son's
stealings and will in all probability settle
the entire amount. Moore and his bride
assert that the body has been stolen by
medical students.

nuts and coffee with -cream to complete

were served, and, after their appetites
had been satisfied; some of the old-timers
pronounced it oneof the best meals they
had ever eaten in their lives.
The overworked deputies at the Morgue
had but little, -rest yesterday. From an

Morrison, calm ani collected and scarcely
moving a muscle,' listened to-day to the
dramatic recital ,'l>y two of her former
neighbors of the (tragic death struggles of
Mrs. Castle, for, â¢whose murder she is be
ing tried. The witnes?. s were Mrs. Bettie
Moberly and Mrs. Emma R. Spangler. the
first persons ttf enter the Castle home in
response to Mrs. Castle's screams for

and will probably prove tbe strongest wlt

A total cf 115 witnesses will be paid for
examination. _
The trial ticean in earnest this morning
when Prosecuting Attorney Brumback
Ftated the case for the State. The court
room was literally jammed with specta
tors, women being in the majority. The.
Morrison family, the Castles and the Wi

charged in appearance, was conducted to
her eeat by her father, and he and her
two married sisters and a brother grouped
Themselves near by. During Attorney

Attorney Brumback said:
"We expect the evidence to show that
Jeesle Morrison went by a circuitous route
to Mr. Castle's house prepareu to kill and
murder Clara Wiley Castle."
They would show, he said, that the pris
oner went armed with two razors, or a
razor and a knife, and that ehe attacked
Mra. Castle, inflicting eighteen wounds.
The crime. It would be shown, was com
mitted through pa*s!on. Jealousy and an
*er. maJlcÂ« ajid hatred against Mra. Cas
tlÂ« and her husband, and the State would
ack for a verdict of murder in the first de
gree.
A- T. Kramer stated the case for the
defence, a^id said they would show that
Miss Morrison had cut Mrs. Castle In eelf
defens* after the latter had attacked her.
They would show, he eaid, that Olin Cas
tle continued to pay Miss Morrison atten
tion a^ter he became engaged to Miss Wi
ley and that he continued to make her
presents and send her love letters. The
evidence would show that Castle ehowed
a'.! of the defendant's notes and letters to
Miss Wiley. aÂ»d that the latter became
extremely jealous and unfriendly toward
Mis*. Morrison: that Miss Wiley, after she
had become Mrs. Castle, called Miss Mor
rison into her house and. after accusing
her of being too lr.tlmate with Castle, at
tacked her wish a razor.
"What she did." eaid Attorney Kramer,

Tj-; ONDON. Dec. 1.â Oscar Wilde died
I at half-past 2 o'clock yesterday
I . afternoon at a small .hotel in tha
H,..^ Quartler Latin. Paris. For Â£he
previous three days he had lain
unconscious or in a delirium from the ef
fects of an abscess in his ear, which tho
doctors could not locate exactly. Inflam
mation from this gradually mounted to
his brain. He died attended by a few
faithful friends, who decline to accept
the general verdict of the world against
him. His end may be compared to that
of Verlalne. It Is interesting to note that
"Mr. and Mrs. Daventry," a play the au
thorship of which Wilde was credited with,
is now the rage here. The majority con
sider it very shocking, and j every one
rushes to see whether it is as bad as re
ported. Wilde, it is declared, was re
ceiving one-fourth of the profits of the
piece, in which Mrs. Patrick Campbell
appears.
PARIS, Dec. 1.â The Journal says it Is
rumored that Wilde committed suicide.
Opcar Fingal O'Flahertie- Wilde was
born' in Dublin ?ln 1SD5. His parents were
both noted people, h's father having a na
tional reputation as a surgeon and his
mother bfing well 'known as a literary
woman. T2io son was given a thorough
education, graduating in 1574 after becom
ing a medalist of'Trinity College, Dublin,
and a prize-winner at Oxford. In 1S79 he
went to London, where he became famous
as a leader of the esthetic movement.
In 1S82 he traveled through the United
States lecturing on art subjects. Return-
Ing to Europe, he. continued his lectures
through England. He v/as everywhere
recognized as a brilliant and brainy man.
His lecturing tour ceased after ho reached
Paris, where he attained still greater hon
ors.* He ietur:iod r to Ixmdon and devoted
his spare time to literary pursuits. The
world was startled in 1S05 by the arrest- of
'Wilde on accusations of infamous con
duct. His' trial attracted world-wide at
tention. He was convicted and sentenced
to two years' servitude at Woking prison.
The confinement, so worked uponÂ°his sys
tem that on his release on the completion
of his sentence he was a physical wreck.
Several attempts have been made since
his release to raise funds for the gifted
author, but none were successful.
Eefore Wilde succumbed to tho effects
of his carousals his fertile brain had fur^
nished the literary world with several
works, the most famous of which was the
novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray,
the Duchess of â¢ Padua," a tragedy. He
was also the author of the comedies
"Lady Windermere's Fan" and "A Wom
an of No Importance." which were played
throughout England and the United
States, attracting many favorable criti
cisms. :'V^'-- '-' Â¦
He visited San Francisco in 1882 "and re

He 'was 'also entertained in fine style at

where he met Judge Hoffman. General

wore his regulation knee breeches, and a

RADICAL CHANGES IN
ARMY BILL ARE PROPOSED
BY SECRETARY ROOT
. "There has been considerable difference
In the promotions on various staff corps
since the war of the rebellion, which haa
led from time to time to special legisla
tion with a view to rectifying inequali
ties. In the new bill which has been pre
sented to Congress the Secretary of war
has caused to be adopted a ratio aa fol
lows: To each colonel there shatl be one
lieutenant colonel and three majors, and
to each major of staff three captains.
"This has been made to apply to the de
partments except in the engineers and
medical departments. The engineers al
ready have a greater proportion of high
grade officers than would be authorized
under this scheme, but no reduction has
been made In the corps. The Increase has
been made at the bottom. The duties of
the engineers are largely connected with
river and harbor improvements."
An official statement In connection with
the bill was issued at the War Depart
ment to-day, as follows:
When natives by their service and char
acter show fitness for command, the Pres
ident is authorized to make provisional
appointments in the grade of first and sec
ond lieutenants.
A regiment of Porto Ricans is also
authorized. - . ; ':
Provision is made for the retirement of
any officer who has been suspended from
duty. This would apply to General Eagan,
commissary general.
The President la authorized to enlist and
organize natives of the Philippines in or
ganization similar to the cavalry and in
fantry to the number of 12,000, the officers
for such organization to be selected from
the regular army. The highest officers in
command of the natives shall be major*.
The provision 'f ob the filling of vacan
cies that may occur by reason of the pro
motion of officers under the proposed act
is as follows:
"That vacancies in the grade of field of
ficers and captain created by this act in
the cavalry, artillery and infantry shall
be filled by promotion according to se
niority in each branch, respectively. Va
cancies existing as the promotions have
been made shall be provl<*ed for aa fol
lows: A sufficient number shall bÂ© re
served for the next graduating class at
the United States Military Academy. Of
ficers now holding commissions In thÂ»
volunteer army and whese age does not
Â¦exceed 32 years at the date of the passage
of this act may be ordered before boards
of officers for such examination as may
be prescribed by the Secretary of War.
Volunteer officers who establish their fit
ness before these examining boards may
be appointed to the grade of second lieu
tenant in the regular army. Volunteer of
ficers so appointed to the grade of second
lieutenant shall be arranged according to
rank on a separate list. All vacancies
then existing in the grade of first lieuten
ant in each arm of the service shall be
filled from this list and the lineal lists of
second lieutenants according to seniority,
as determined by length of prior commis
sioned service; but nothing herein con
tained shall change the relative rank of
officers heretofore commissioned as second
lieutenants In the regular army.
"When the vacancies in the crade of
first lieutenant shall have been filled from

line of the army, the details lasting four
years, after which the officers shall not

vision for filling vacancies at the head of
the various staff corps is as 'follows:
Provision for the discontinuance of the ,
artillery arm as at present organized is
made by organizing an artillery corps
known as coast artillery and field artil
lery. Officers of artillery are to be placed
on one list for promotion according to
seniority. The corps will have a chief of

The, adjutant general will have the
rank of major general, and his corps Is
increased one lieutenant colonel and ten

and six majors. The judge advocate's de

three majors. The quartermaster's de

were drawn from, her teeth." said Ine

TEL, WASHING-TON, Nov. SO.â If Tur
key should settle direct with the Ameri
can missionaries, who filed claims for
$90,000 with the State Department, no com
plaint will be made by the administra
tion. It is conceded by some that this
may be the result of the visit of the Ken
tucky. The authorities insist that the
United States cannot afford to accept a
settlement of the claims under cover of
a ship contract, but it. has no control
over the claimants. Such a course would,
however, probably be welcomed by the
authorities. In the case of Frank Pears,
who was murdered In Honduras, while
the Government was insisting upon the
payment of an indemnity of $10,000, the
heirs were conducting private .negotia
tions with Honduras. In the interest \ of
the future protection of American inter
ests the department deemed it advisable
to continue to press the claim, with the
result that it was patti.
It was learned to-night that Mr. Gris
com had sent a cablegram to I Secretary
Hay. which indicates that the Turkish
claims may soon be satisfactorily set
tled. All that the officials would say
was that the information is encouraging.
LONDON, Dec. 1.â "It Is probable, '
eays the Constantinople correspondent of

will be canceled as soon as the Kentucky

money is to be found."
A Renter dispatch from Constantinople
says it is suggested that Russia Is
prompting the Forte to refuse to grant
an exequatur to Dr. Norton. The dis
patch adds: "It- is an open secret that
they dislike the foreign consuls in Asia
Minor, especially the Americans, whom
they suspect of aiding the American mis
sion work in Armenia." Â¦ Â¦ .
CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. , 29 (Thurs
day).âThe opinion is expressed in diplo
matic circles that the American claims
arising from the Armenian Â¦ massacres
"may now be regarded as practically set
tled, as an irade providing for the build

officially promulgated."

and identified him. 'She said she , was
formerly Mrs. Hallie E. Norton, a widow,
living In "Vernon, Mich., a short distance

advertisement appeared in Detroit, and
she and Welch, alias Cross, alias Holmes,

went to Detroit to meet him. This was
November 17. That night they crossed the
river' to Windsor, Ont., and were married.
They stayed at the Manning House, and
when she awoke the following morning
her husband was gone. with $700 of her

Mrs, Welch says she drank beer that
was drugged by her new husband. The
matter was reported to the authorities,

TEL., WASHINGTON, Nov. SO.â No ob
jection will be made by. this Government
to punitive expeditions sent to different
sections of China by other nations. This
decision was reached at a meeting of the
Cabinet to-day, when Secretary Hay
brought to the attention of the President
and his colleagues dispatches handed to
him by Wu Ting Fang from Viceroys of
Southern China appealing to this Gov
ernment to use Its Influence to prevent the
dispatch of a punitive expedition to the
province of Shansi. The authorities will
not permit the American troops to take
part in any attack on peaceful Chinese,
and It is believed that the attitude adopt
ed by this Government will have a . salu
tary effect on Europe.
Secretary Hay has received information
showing that in compliance with the in
structions sent him on Tuesday, Minister
Conger has '.[ recommended negotiations
contemplating Â¦ a modification of the de
mands adopted by the foreign Ministers.
It is presumed that he has prepared pro
posals of a moderate character suggested
by. the Secretary of State, and that he
will receive counter proposals from his
colleagues which will be based upon the
instructions given them.
, LONDON, Dec 1, 8:20 a. m.â The Spec
tator in a striking article dealing with
the Chinese crisis expresses the opinion
that the most, recent occurrences in Pe
king foreshadow a Chinese victory over
the allies. "The Quarrel has. been
brought to a test of force,". it says, "and
force on the civilized side has proved in
sufficient. This result is mainly due to
the attitude of Russia and â¢ the United
States. If China escape with the payment
of - a small Indemnity and many prom
ises on paper, , as seems not unlikely,
since Germany and Great Britain may
not be willing to incur the. expenditure
and '- risk involved in persisting In their
demands, it will be equivalent to a vic

6T. LOUIS, Nov. 30.â Judge Thayer In
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals to-day rendered his decision on the
appeal of John W. Gates et al. for the ap
pointment of a receiver for the Guardian
Trust Company of Kansas City, and is
sued an order appointing Hon. Francis M.
Black to that position with a bond of $100 -
000.
The court finds that for the protection
of all Interests it is best to place the as
sets of the trust company. in the custody
of a competent receiver until a final de
cree shall be rendered, or until some ar
rangement shall be made among the
shareholders which will enable the com
pany to resmue Its business with adequate
capital and conduct it on proper lines. In
his opinion Judge Thayer said:
"The proof 6hows with reasonable cer
tainty that the officers and directors of
the defendant company have made a prac
tice of organizing other corporations to
engage In various enterprises of a highly
speculative character; that funds of the
company to a large amount have been in
vested in the stock and lands of such con
cerns which had at the time no market
value; that money In considerable sums
had been loaned to such companies, some
times upon their stock as collateral and
on other occasions without any security;
that some of these enterprises have
proved absolute failures, and that the
money invested therein had been wholly
lest, while other of such enterprises are
in a precarious condition and the outcome
thereof is doubtful and uncertain.
â¢â¢â¢Moreover. In some cases. If not in all.
there appears to have been such identity
In the personnel of the governing bodies
Of these corporations and the governing
body of the trust company that it is im
possible to believe that the Interests of
either were properly guarded In any of the
transactions and dealings which occurred
between them. -'I nil" HIM
"In addition to the acts aforesaid the
proof shows that the defendant company
has made large investments In real prop
erty apparently without a shadow, of au
thority under Its charter. Such unauthor
ised investments have resulted in the
locking up of the company's available
means and impairing: its usefulness.
â¢â¢Furthermore, the court entertains no
doubt that the defendant company has
paid one and probably several dividends
out of Its general fund that was not
earned, such payments being made for the
purpose of allaying suspicion as to the
condition of the company and creating a
false Impression that It was In a prosper
ous condition."
The court is of the opinion that the act
creating trust companies does not author
lie the acquisition of securities by such
companies either as an Investment or as
collateral for lefans unless they have an
ascertainable market value and may be
properly termed "investment' securities."
In accordance with these views, the
court finds that It Is unsafe for the com
pany to continue the further transaction
of its customary business until It has real
ized upon some of its assets and liquidated
its present Indebtedness.

STORM-SCATTERED
v^ BIRDS RETURNING
Good Shootlnsr Is Expected During
the Weekâ Quail Plentiful
in Mann-
The storms of last week scattered the
ducks and the shooters were all in a
quandary last Saturday and Sunday on
the Suisun marshes. Not a club in that
locality had what was considered any
thing of a shoot and all the gunners re-
turned home disgusted and disgruntled.
Toward the end of the week, after the
north wind be.ian to blow, the ponds
showed more of the feathered tribe and
those few men who could get away from
town on. Wednesday found the sport
much Improved.
The shooting clubs will be well packed
to-morrow with ardent Nlmrods, all being
most anxious to take advantage of che
present conditions.
Quail and snipe are still Plentiful. In
Mar In and San Mateo counties and all
through the interior quail abound and are
easily got at. This year has been a record
breaker for snipe In certain localities.
YACHTSMEN AT PEACE
WITH SAUSALITO TOWN
If Barrels or Bubys Are In the Way
of Government Ships They
Will Be Removed.
The yacht owners and the Town Council
of Sarsalito have reached an amicable
agreement Â¦with regard to the unoccupied
moorings off the clubhouse of the San
Francisco Yacht Club. Ordinance No. 70
was passed by the Town Council May 3.
1S97, but though it created some little stir
at the time has been allowed to remain
inoperative. It gives power to the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees, who was
at the time of Its passage General J. H.
Dickinson but is now Adolph Sylva, to re
quire any yacht anchored or moored with
in the waters over which the Council has
jurisdiction to move or change her" an
chorage or mooring whenever in his Judg
ment it shall be necessary for any pur
pose. The violation of the ordinance may
be punished by f. fine of not more than Ko,
and a further fine of (5 for each day that
the ''vessel remains at her mooring, after
notice. The Town Council naturally
wisiies to promote the prosperity of Bau-
Falita and -to encourage the adoption of
the town aB a wintering place for revenue
cutters, survey and other Government ves
sels. Adolph fiylva says that while he
would not ask that any yacht lying at her
moorings should be removed, he does not
think that the floats connected with un
used moorings should be' permitted to
block the bay and to keep away vessels
the presence of which, with scores or hun
dreds of men on board, mean much to the
tradespeople of Sausalito. F. A. Hyde,
charterer of the yawl Royal and a mem
ber of the San Francisco Yacht Club, was
unable to be present at the meeting of .the
vacht owners last Sunday, but gave it as
his opinion as a lawyer that, even if the
town ordinance should prove defective or
inoperative, there are United States stat
utes governing the matter, and a moor
ing once removed under them could never
be replaced. The schooner Ramona, owned
by SupervlÂ«<or and Commodore W: N. Mc-
Carthy, is lying at her own moorings, the
yawl â¢ Tramontana is at the moorings of
the Lurllne and two or three small sloops,
among which are the Dewey and Juanlta,
are also moored -In the deep water chan
nel off the clubhouse. The mooring buoys
or barrels of the yachts Sappho, White
Wings, Folly and Lurllne are those that
chiefly interfere with the anchorage. \ If
any Government vessel comes into Sausa
lito and her commander complains that
certain mooring barrels are In the way of
his craft taking up a suitable and con
venient anchorage the commodore will no
tify the owner to remove the float and
drop his mooring chain to the bottom. The
schooner Chlspa has already done this and
has taken up a mooring to the north of
the ferry slip, where are lying the steam
yacht El Primero. the schooners Virginia
White Wings, Aggie and Lurllne the yawl
Phyllis and some sloops.'- It Â¦will not be
i necessary to remove; the moorings them
! selves, but only the floats and the ropes
attached thereto. The lines can : then â¢; be
connected with other, buoys or, barrels, so
that when the yachts come back in the
"spring they can readily pick up - their
chains..

"With the exception of the mail -from the

Sacramento arid Tanforan shows.
.The Judge, E.Davles of Dewdnejr.'B. C.
while an unknown, quantity in California,
has given uniform satisfaction at the
shows he has judged in the north and,
moreover, enjoys the. added prestige of a
successful career in the judging ring in
England. It goes without . saying that the
prospect of having an expert of this cali
ber pass on a dog has induced many fan
ciers to enter." The northern entry is esti
mated to consist -of about" twenty-three
dogs and thirty entries; the number of
dogs entered already is 164, the, individual
entries amounting to 194, which" will make
a grand total! when all are in of 189 dogs
and 224 entries. Â¦
Among the dogs to be exhibited are sev
eral new arrivals on the coast, notably a
Boston terrier just broughfout by Thom
as H. Williams Jr., and the great prize
winning fox terrier JVibo, purchased by
Charles K. Harley. This dog has done
considerable winning in England and has
had . since his importation from that coun
try a most successful career in the East

This is the week scheduled for the clos
ing of the baseball season, one which has
been more or less lnstiumental in reviv
ing the old and long slumbering spirit 'of
the fanatic. Although the champions of
last year.' Sacramento, began this season
with even a greater, set of .twlrlers than
wore the gilt the preceding year that club
was by no means the undoubted cham
pion until about six weeks ago, .when the
local team lost its winning stride. Then
Sacramento forged ahead, leading' the
local team easily for first honors. â¢ Sac
ramento wiir wave the pennant another
year.
Â¦ The season started off in doubt and un
certainty as far as the relative merit cf
the teams went. Sacramento, fortified by
Hughes, was rated the stronger; Stockton,
with an aggregation of hitters second to
none, was considered a good second; Oak
land, I looking very well on paper, was
more or less enigmatical, and San Fran
cisco was proclaimed the sure tail-ender.
At this time the local team was in a form
ative state, waiting for a shortstop and a
Â¦-first baseman. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦â¢ '
Until the season was fairly well ad
vanced the teams ranked in the above
order. San Francisco began to play bet
ter ball about two months after the open
ing and by a series of victories . snot
ahead ' of Oakland. Then came the race
for second place and in steady, currential
fashion the locals outdistanced Stockton.
During the last four months San Francis
co has-been occupying the second placa,
Stockton third and Oakland fourth.
The struggle for first place between San
Francisco and Sacramento In the middle
of the season and that of a month ago
were the sensational epochal stages.- For
both. 7 these series crowds turned out that
flooded the. grounds and: there was every
bit as much excitement as In the old "hal
cyon days." The character of the games
was such that the sated palate of the old
fanatic was tickled. Then came thera
actlon and since those noisy games the
season has worked Itself along easy paths.
- What changes are in store has <not yet
been decided upon. There has been some
talk of securing a grounds site on the
southwest corner of Eleventh and Market
streets, now occupied by a long row of
low houses. It has been 'well proved 'that
the present grounds lack space and ac
commodations for the public on big day*.
.. It is hardly, likely that a series of win
ter baseball will be played this year, as
the spirit Is averse to it.
This afternoon -on- the Recreation
grounds Oakland and San Franciaco will
begin its last series. The-.teams will line

Miss Alice C. Hoffman has been elected
captain of the ladies' team of th* San

On the 26th Miss Hoffman made two
rounds of the Presidio links In Â£9 and 33.
respectively. On Thanksgiving day there
was a large attendance at tne San Fran
cisco course, among those present being
some ladies. Miss Edith McBean beat
Miss Morgan 8 up in a match game.
To-morrow Horace Rawlins and his
brother Harry, professionals of the Oak
land Golf Club, will pay a visit to the
new course of the Sausalito Golf Club,
which it has been necessary to lay out
again in consequence of the barracks ajid
officers' auarters to tie erected by the
Government. The course is laid out over
very rough ground and is unusually diffi
cult. The course on the Fort Baker res
ervation -was first laid out by Stephenson.
formerly Instructor of the San Francisco
Golf Club, in conjunction with Captain
T. W. M. Draper. It take9 in all the. avail
able space of the canyon, between the
fortifications and Fort Baker. The first
four boles axe over rough but not spe
cially difficult ground. The fifth hole is
a hard one, as there are several little
ravines caused by the branching of a
creek. Then the golfer pursues bis "gut
ty." having 1 to his right a steep hill and
to his left a little- gorge; next he has to
cross the ridga with two small blind
gulches against the wind. A drive down
hill across another gulch brings tha
player to the seventh, hole, between which
and tbe eighth is a .screen of trees with
a narrow opening to the right. The home
gTeen is protected by a marshy hazard.
The whole course is decidedly sporty and
the best record for the nine holes is 67.
The Government buildings have necessi
tated the rearrangement of the course, es
pecially as regards the first, fourth and
ninth holes. The putting greens are not.
to speak accurately, "greens" at all. ad
It has not been found possible to convey
the water necessary to keep turf green.
They are of cUr.and sand, rolled smooth
and hard. G^/eral Shafter has been very
kind in f>erm! ;ting the green committee of
the Sausallt'i Golf Club to lay out the
course In an/ part of '.he reservation and
the changes rendered necessary by the
erection of the soldiers* quarters are
rather beneficial than otherwise. Permis
sion has also been granted for the erec
tion of a small clubhouse. This is a per
mission never before granted on a "West
ern military reservation, even the hand
some-clubhouse at the Presidio standing
entirely clear of the Government grounds
Notwithstanding: the- wet and muddv
weather of last Sunday some progress
was made In the tournament on the Fort
Baker links. In the mixed foursomes Mis-*
Mabel Mason and J. M. Kllsrarif defeated
Mrs/Mason and Captain T. W. M. Dra
per 3 up. Miss Mason playing a steady
game throughout. In the men's com?i v 
titlon Leonard Chenery defeated H. Clay
Miller, the winner's score for eighteen
holes being 74 and the loser's 99. L. Chen
ery played a good long Frame and putted
accurately. Play was continued on
Thanksgiving day.

CALIFORNIA'S
ELEVEN THE
BEST.
Opinion . of Football
Men* as to the
Merits of the Two
University Teams..
The general opinion among football men
In regard to the Thanksgiving day gams
is that the better, team lost: This may
seem antithetical, but It is pretty much of
a fact, nevertheless, and the game be
tween Stanford cand California this year
was an example Â¦ of what well-directed,
chanceful endeavor will do on the football
field.
During the first half of the game the
ball was in Stanford's possession on so
few occasions as never to give California
the least cause of apprehension. From
Palo Alto came the glowing accounts of
superior offense, but on the field and
against the foe Stanford's aggressive tac
tics came to a. sudden halt. . California,
on the other hand, plunged through the
Stanford line for consistent, appreciable
gains and twice in this half was within
scoring distance. Once Stanford's line
took on a bit of mucilage and held fast,
California losing 1 the ball on downs. The
second time, with but a few yards to gain,
Womble gave the signal for a drop Kick,
a try for goal which failed. It seems
strang-e that another attempt to gain the
necessary distance was not made. Stan
ford's line had been found puncturable
enough up to that time and the' uncer
tainty of a Held goal should ha\;e per
suaded California to try for a touchdown.
In this half California's defense was
superb and her team play offensive, far
better than Stanford's though none too
good at that. In fact, the only semblance
of team work In the lirst part of the game
was displayeoby California, Stanford be
ing pretty mucn at, sea in this regard.
Later on Stanford pulled together and
then her offensive work was of better
quality. In the second half the cardinal
had tne blue and gold on the run for a
time, but whenever the ball was perilously
near the California goal posts nothing
could be done to advance it. Twice place
kick tries for goals were made, but with
out success. Then, as a last desperate
chance, Traeger did the trick' that won
the game.
The most noticeable feature of the game
was California's losses- in punting. More
ground was lost in this way than the
bucking gains of the eleven could i com
pensate in the second half. To fortify
and augment these losses came the extras
by way of handling kicks. It is a remark
able thing that with backs such as Cali
fornia possesses, such poor * handling of
kicks should be a feature of their play.
The .veriest preparatory school 1 football
player could Handle punts as well as 'the
California backs ; did Thursday.' This it
is that lost California the game. When
Gammon dropped a punt on Â¦; the ' thirty
yard line and a red shirt fell â¢' on, the ball,,
this was a costly play, for soon after the
field goal was kicked.
From the standpoint of football Thurs
day's gsftne was glittering only -in its
errors. > Compared with â¢ ' the California
team of last year, this year's eleven . is
like a steam dummy to a modern locomo
tive.. The concentration of effort and the
ability to take full advantage of accidents
and incidents of the game were lacking.
This may have been due to the. pejorative
conditions existing at . California, the ne
cessity of trying new men to, fill un
expected vacancies or to mistaken judg
ment'on the field. 'And Stanford : off ereC
nothing in the way of team brilliancy to
make the football ' . enthusiast - raise , his
breath. The game was pretty. much one
of individual effort. . ; â¢>'-./:.-.
.Both, teams possess men who. worked
hard and earnestly and: showed 'their; full
mettle. â¢ - The much heralded Slaker : and
Seeley did , not prove themselves superior
In any, way to. the well developed* home
material. It was only in the second half
that Slaker 1 s efforts were fruitful.: Smitn,
Erb and especially Hill of Stanford : and
Warren Smith and Gammon of California
were all in" the game and showed . it â¢ by
their work. " â¢ â¢'.- v,'. v ;,._,â¢ ; .
Some talk is heard among the. Stanford
collegians of bringing the Harvard "team
to the coast." Just what shape Stanford
could put Itself â¢ in Â¦ to meet : Harvard ; by
Christmas Js a matter of pure * and Idle
speculation. , Steady, coaching might de
velop the present team â¢, into ' a> formidable
eleven, but it .would take 'long, and careful
work. to equip the cardinal with- fighting
force equal to offset the' crimson team; Â¦ ; â¢
; The Stanford second eleven "is air ln-
viduallty in itself. All. through the season
It fougbt like, a composite demon. . A
few days v ago the second team announced
that if .the varsity men beat Californiaâ
thus establishing a reputationâ it would
challenge them for a match game.
According: to intercollegiate agreement
the coaches of the university teams will
be hereafter graduates of the colleges.
Speculation is running rife among the col
lege men who will be the head coaches.

At â¢ Stanford, j Fickert. -.- Fraiikenheimer.

races. Then, boarding a train, he had a
swell time laving ripe, mellow odds
aprainst the starters In those two events.
Of course, he favored the wlnpers, and is
paid to have had a $200 or $300 bank roll
by the time the track was reached.
The judges at Tanforan are still endeav
oring- to determine the ownership of Ord
nung, which some days ago won a race
with the rider wearing the colors of
"Frisco" Llnd. Pupil, owned ' by Green
Morris, finished second, and the latter
horseman protested payment of the purse
to Llnd, claiming Ordnung Is the property
of Johnny Schorr. Nine out of ten own
ers around the track believe as Mr. Mor
ris does, but still that does not make it
so. Johnny Is considered a very wily
young man, as. for Instance, last season,
when he started F. W. Brode two or three
times in the muddy going, knowing the
colt could not untrack himself in it. Then,
with everybody apparently mesmerized or
hypnotized, F. W. Brode appeared as a
starter in a cheap selling event at Oak
land. Opening at 2Vx to 1, when the price,
should have Doen 1 to 10, he won in a
romp, and the coup of the "little Boer"
was the talk of tne town that night. .
Another race that Is on the grill is the
Wooster Boy-The Lady affair. In deci
phering the change of form shown by
Louis Ezell's mare the officials might take
into consideration that Marty Bergen is
not the Bergen of ten years ago. The
rider himself may think 6O. but many a
fighter Imagined the same thing until he
entered the ring pitted against a fresh
young scrapper. After a round or two the
difference bet-ween punching a bag and
fighting then becomes apparent.

For some days i negotiations have been
pending looking to a peaceful solution of
the local racing situation, but the negotia
tions hung flr* because of differences over
the price to be paid for the stock held by
Corrigan and Ullman.. This has now been
amicably adjusted to the satisfaction of
all parties concerned, the papers trans
ferring the stock will be drawn up by the
attorneys of each side and within a day
or two the signatures will be attached.
This action will no doubt terminate the
local turf career of Ed Corrlgah and also
of Ullman. The Master o.f Hawthorne
has given out that he will confine his fu
ture racing operations to England, while
Joe Ullman Is heavily Interested In East
ern turf ventures.

First Past the Wire on Three Winning Horses at T anforan Park.
/Walkenshaw Runs Unplacedâ Amasa in Front.
By F. E. MULHOLLAND
WITH only a memory of the
great throng of the day be
fore, all seemed peaceful and
QDiet. almost to dreariness, at
Tanforan Park yesterday.
Thf crowd wrestled with a card that had
nothing much to recommend it. gaining
three Ealla and losing three. The sport
was featureless, unless it was the daen
ing saddle work of O Connor, which rider
succeeded Jn putting three winners over
the plate.
Everybody fully expected to see Cougar,
the Klrnwood farm entry, run away from
the other three staners in the scramble
for maiden two-year-olds. The colt
ruled a 7 to 20 chance, and didn't do any
thing of . the sort. It was only through
fcara riding that O'Connor landed him
rirst, a head in front of Ravelling.
Sam Hildreth scratched Wooster Boy
from the seven ana one-half furlong
run. leaving In Vulcain to try conclusion*
wf.h Redwald and Wax. The hooded
hcrse was l to 2 In the ring, and led
throughout. Redwald was slightly cut
down, but managed to beat Wax out for
the place.
Had Bdg-ardo, favorite for the third
event, not been pounds the best, he could
never have made It. Cut off right alter
the start and again at the far turn.
O'Connor, who bad the mount, took mat
ters quietly until the stretch was reached.
Then, cutting loose, the first choice
waltzed to the front, winning hands
down. Rosalbra, the pacemaker, stayed
well; beating Rainier.- a 100 to 1 shot, out,
for the place.
"Wyoming let the talent down again, with
a thud. Gaylon Brown's bay horse looked
the most hkely of the nine starters In
the event next decided, also at seven fur
lones. and was accordingly installed fa
vorite. Henry Shields succeeded in get
ting: away from the post poorly, losing
all the ground possible, and finished sec
ond to.Novla, with O'Connor In the sad
dle. The winner was. well supported at
odds cf 6 and S to 1. Mounce landed El
Mido in the show, ahead of Free Lance.
Jack Martin piloted the winner of the
fifth number, a mile run, decided under
Felling conditions. ' Walkenshaw was
quietly plunged on at even money, and
failed to finish among the first three.
Away sixth. Sir Kingston shook oft* Pilot.
and everything went pleasant with him
until 'the wire drew near. Then Owens
bcro.went after him, followfa by Tirade,
and, .coming like a whirlwh.:* the last
r.arned horse lost out by -a neck only.
Owensboro was a head further away.
F"or some reason everyone, seemed to
thir.g Amasa would be defeated in the
closing dash, which caused his odds to re
cede from 2 to S to 1. Outbreaking his
company, he set a clip that proved too
faet' for the others, and. hard ridden to
ward the end.- reached the: wire less
than a length before th? favorite, Maud
Ferguson. HaÂ£ Briar bren successful in
. getting a bcaor start, the black horse
would have been hard to beat. . â¢

OPPOSB AUTOMATIC
FIRE SPRINKLERS
Spring Valley Company Officials Oh-
ject to Attaching Six-Inch
Mains; Thereto.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee had
under consideration yesterday, the ordi
nance providing for the installation of
automatic fire sprinklers In buildings and
manufacturing Â¦ plants. Attorney Kellogg
of the Spring Yalley Water Company op
posed the ordinance because It would re
quire the attachment of six-inch supply
mains and meters, which, he said, would
mean an enormous expense to the com
pany. Frank H. Gould addressed the
committee on the , advantages of the
sprinklers, which he said reduced the Iobs
by fire to a minimum. Chief Sullivan of
the Fire Department, he said, strongly
favored the extinguishers. H. Euler, pro
prietor of a box factory, told how a fire
in the factory was extinguished in its in
clpiency by the sprinklers.
Attorney Kellogg contended that a six
inch main was entirely too large and that
a five or four Inch* main, which is now
in operation, is sufficient to provide all
necessary water. . .
Further consideration of the ordinance
was postponed untH December 27. when
the engineers of the company will furnish
figures to show that the five-inch main
will supply enough water;

these reports, instead of coming into the

honored by an audience with the Pope,
who he says Is quite well and sprightly,
notwithstanding the fact that he has
passed his ninety-first birthday. The
newspaper reports regarding the Pope's
feebleness are much exaggerated, Father
Farrelly says. Pope Leo seemed interest
ed in topics concerning the United States
and he inquired particularly of the con
dition of the church and people in Cali
fornia. He manifested a feeling of deep
Interest In the people. .
OONSTABLES MUST TREAT :
PRISONERS MORE GENTLY
Supreme Court Holds an Officer Who
Used Excessive Force in-Mak-
. ing an. Arrest. â¢
Constables throughout the State wlll:'be
greatly surprised to learn that they can
not assault a prisoner with a club or other
weapon with Impunity. The Supreme
Court yesterday, handed down a decision
holding that excessive force must not be'
used !n making arrests... â¢ . :
The decision was rendered In a suit for
damages that Is one of the most novel
brougnt before the higher court for re
view. Thomas M. Matneus, constable for
the township of "Wilmington, Los Angeles,
County, and his.two bondsmen, J. P. eilva
and T. Crowley. were sued by Gerry
Towle for Injuries received- at the hands
of the < constable and his tieputy, a man
named Matthews. â
It appears that Towle committed a
breach of the peace at Sin Pedro and was
taken Into custody by Matheus. The pris
oner became violent and the- constable
was forced to put handcuffs on him. Towle
showed tight and landed on the consta
ble's jaw and a struggle ensued. Matheus
called for aid from the bystanders and
Matthews came to his assistance. .The
struggle between Towle and his captors!
became so violent that .Matheus pulled his
pistol out- of his pocket -and dealt the
prisoner a' heavy blow over .the head, lnr
fllctlng a scalp wound. -The deputy, con
stable, folio wed up this move by shooting
Towle in the back.
When Towle recovered from his wound
he instituted a damage suit against the
constable and his bondsmen, find the jury
In the lower court gave him a verdict for
$500. t The costs of suit, amounting to $106.
were added. Matheus appealed and the
Supreme Court affirmed the judgment
upon the ground that excessive force had
been used In arresting Towle.
Sullivan Loses on a Foul.
CHICAGO. Nov. 30.â Persistent fouling
lost Dave Sullivan of New York his fight
with Ole Oleson to-night at the Illinois
Athletic Club. After the first roundi- in
which he had decidedly the worst of it,
Sullivan resorted to choking and elbow
ing in the clinches. In the third round
the New Yorker's unfair tatfti.es became
so flagrant that Referee Slier was com
pelled to disqualify him and give the tight
to Oleaon.
Pons Defeats Pienening.
NEW YORK. Nov. 30.â Paul Pons. the
French wrestler,*; jto-nlght at the Grand
Central Palace pucceeded.ln putting John
Plenenlng of this city to the boards twice
In succession after a most interesting, al
though one sided, wrestling bout.' The
men wrestled under the Graeco-Roman
rules, best two in three falls.
Yanger and Herrick Draw.
MILWAUKEE, Nov. 30.â Benny Yanger.
the "Tipton Slasher" of Chicago and Kid
Herrick of Brooklyn fought six rounds
to a draw before the Badger Athletic
Club to-night. Both men were on their
feet- and apparently fresh at the end of
the bout. There was no knockdown.. -
The inquiry Into the contempt of Dudley
Dubois of Nome reached that stage yes
terday when seme testimony regarding
the actions of Dubois himself was se
cured. George A. Bernham, one of the
Marshal's deputies, who went to Nome to
bring back McKenzie. told how he served
upon Dubois an order summoning Dubois
to appear and explain his contempt. Du
bois was much disturbed, and a day or bo
after while the two deputies were sitting
at a table with a man named Orton, Du
bois came and speaking to Orton asked If
he knew If there was any law by which
he couia escape going to San Francisco.
Dubois said his business was in such a
shape that he could not possibly go. and
he said he would give Orton $1000 If he
could find some law by which he could
escape from It. Bernham also told of the
serving of the warrant upon McKenzie
and the execution of the of super
sedeas. He said, too, that when the writ
of certiorarl was served on Judge Noyes
all Judge Noyes said was that he' was
sorry the deputies had not a warrant to
take him to San Francisco as well.
J. C. Barton was the principal witness of
the morning. He told how he once heard
Noyes say, "If I don't appoint McKenzie
a receiver, who shall I appoint? ; He has
been my friend for twenty years, and I
will appoint him for every mine he wants.
And If he does not want the appointment
I will^ appoint whomever he will recom
mend." This was said one day when
r^oyes-came into a room where were seat
ed Barton. McKenzie and others. It waÂ«
at the time Noyes' appointments were be
ginning to be talked about.
On another occasion the witness heard
McKenzie tell Cameron, who had been
placed In charge of the Topkok mine that
Cameron was to do everything McCor
mlck wanted him to do. and he himself
would see Cameron through.
Â¦On direct examination Barton told how
he had seen a man named Barr> bring in
some grold from the Topkok mlnÂ», and
Barr had said there were 127 ounces. Later
Barton was told by McKenzie there were
but 114. On direct examination the wit
ness told a story of how some of the gold,
two sacks of it, was emptied out by Mc-
Kenzie, but on cross-*-xaialnatlon it was
shown that he knew very little about the
handling of the gold by McKenzie.
He said McKenzie was looked upon as a
dictator and a man with whom every one
had to. stand In.
' Robert McKillican. ex-Sheriff of Alameda
County, was called to tell what he knew
of the sentiment of the people In regard
to McKenzie and the ring he was in with.
He said It was the general opinion it was
a queer proceeding to declare that the
gold in a claim was in jeopardy ard so
appoint a receiver to get It out. It was
believed the gold was safer In the gravel
banks than it would be In the hands of
any receiver. It was the. opinion of the
miners that a man could not. get Justice
In the Nome court because there was a
clique, headed by McKenzie and Noyes
that controlled things It was believed'
too, that a man could not get justice, and
that If he discovered a good paving- claim
he would surely find himself in the courts.
The witness aid also heard threats of
lynching, Judge Noyes, but he had not
heard these threats often.
. Bernham was the last witness of the
morning-, and then the ca3e went over to
Tuesday morning, at which- time. It Is ex
pected. Deputy Marshal Monckton. the
second deputy who went to Nome, will be
well enough to appear and testify. Hr
has been 111 for more than a week.

Julius Home is the possessor of â¢ a 10
months-old puppy .which he expects will
make a stir when he starts: He is by For
Freedom out of Bona, weighs ; fifty-eight
pounds and has been judged a comer by
leashmen who have seen him. ' ..:...
H. H. Walker, the. restaurateur -at
Union Park, became a leashman a short
time. ago by the acquisition of the grey
hound Cora Pearl. He was forced Into
the ranks, havlngr had the' courser left
with him as. security for a jsmall debt and
finally belngr presented with a bill of sale
of the' dog in settlement of the account.
Cora .was entered in. the ThanksjrivinB
day stake and drawn;agalnst Old Glory,
who was quoted a 2 to 1 ravorite. Walker
had no faith In his hound's ability as a
but when asked-, how much he
had played on his kennel to make him
self a thoroughbred, he replied that he
etood to win quite a bunch if Cora landed,
and in the event of her beating Trade's
dog would stand treat to the extent of a
turkey dinner for the boys. Walker gave
little thought to his promise until the in
termission. When his patrons commenced
to file out one by one they would pass the
counter and say, "This; Is on Cora
Pearl's winning."* Walker smiled In acqui
escence to the first four stand-offs,'- but
they kept coming In such bunches that he
soon called a halt. Some one had fflven
the tip and the restaurant was filled with
congratulatory feeders. His free custom
ers ate about $12 worth of turkey. -Walker
hadn't bet a cent on his dog and Cora
Pearl had won her course. . '
Union Park offers a good card of sport
for to-day's and to-morrow's stake. One
hundred and twelve nominations have
been made and many hard courses are
looked for. The first train for the park

\ J.E have noted the Eastern opposition to any
\\f direct appropriation from the Federal treas-.
* * ury in behalf of irrigation in the West. The
matter must be looked at practically. The Eastern
land-owner is not friendly to the aided development of
a new area to compete with his unaided industry. The
fight, on that line, is likely to be so prolonged that
the progressive 'destruction of forage and forests will
enlarge the desert area and more than double the final
cost of its reclamation. "
All this may be avoided if the West will* wisely un
derstand and energetically promote its own interests
by a policy which is entirely within its own control.
If Western interests will prepare and present to Con
gress a bill for an act to lease the arid grazing ranges
on the public domain under such conditions as to pre
scrve.the forage and forests and devote the income of
the leases to'Government irrigation works/ it will be
giving permanency to the grazing business, to the
meat and wool supply of the country, and .wilj.be pre
serving the natural conditions upon which irrigation
depends.
It. will be also installing and: enlarging an object
lesson, which will usefully educate the East in the'
'merits of irrigation, and lead by natural. steps to a
further enlistment of Federal aid in reclamation.
The matter lies with the ; stock men themselves.
They desire permanency of their business, but its end
is now in sight, as the extirpation of the forage 13
easily calculable. They desire also the development
of land that may be subjected to tillage by irrigation.
They want the moisture, of the range preserved by
saving its vegetable covering, for they exwt by the af
fluence of the deep springs and the constancy of the
watercourses,
No such. opportunity has ever before been^ offered
a great industry to perpetuate : itself . and become the
agent of. new development as isVnow. offered: to" the
grazing interests of the West. The East has, no

SKELETON IN .CLOSETâ Edna, City.

some one who had.no care or trouble.
Coming: In her search to one who she
thought must be content and happy, she
told her what she wanted. The lady took
her to a closet 'containing a human skel
eton. 'Madame,' said she, 'I try to keep
my sorrows to myself, but I will tell you
that every night I am compelled by my
husband to kiss this skeleton of him who
was once his rival. Think you. then, that
I can be happy?" The inference is cer

BRYAN IN SAN FRANCISCOâ A cor
respondent alludingr to an answer that
was given to another correspondent about
W. J. Bryan's arrival in San Francisco
writes that ' on Â¦ onb occasion "he came'
over from Oakland mole on a tug in com
pany with W. AV. Foote and other prom
inent Democrats. -The party landed from
the tug at Mission-street wharf No. 1 and
from there was driven In- a carnage up
Mission street.'-' This is evidently not the
same ; occ'aslon as the one referred to in
the answer previously published.
Where all deserve commendation for duty faith
ful.r performed it is something of an invidious ta=k
to select any for particular praise, but justice requires
that special mention be made of the work of the
Southern Pacific Hospital and its staff. That institu
tion was bound by no law to open its doors to the
sufferers who were brought to it, and yet it did so
without one moment of hesitation. The call of hu
manity was obeyed as. if it had been a divine com
mand, and nothing of energy, expense, skill or car;
was fpared by the officers and the attendants of the
hospital in relieving the stricken ones so far as itivas
possible to do so.
Out of this proof of the existence of a spirit of
genuine humanity in the city the general" mass of our
people may draw something of comfort. The minis
trations of friends will do much to comfort the af
flicted homes, while pastors of the churches will re
call to them the consolations of religion. That is as
much as can be done now, and with abundant sym
pathy for all the sorrowing ones the people will leave
it for the officers of the law and the Coroner's jury
to determine whether or no there be any one to blame..
The Bp^rd of Supervisors has reached the conclu
sion that our Police Department in every matter af
fecting public interest is inefficient. The board should
remember, however, that the police, whatever they
cannot do, are admirably qualified to take care of
?hcmtcWei.
Even while still sore .with the feeling of grief over
sc'many blighted and sorrowing hdmes, the people of
San Francisco will note with thankfulness the excel
lent work done by ths -police and .by the hospitals .of
the city and the physicians generally for the relief "of
the victims. All upon whom responsibility in meeting
the emergency rested did their duty with promptness,
efficiency and fidelity. Of the police not only those
who were on duty but many who were off duty* re
sponded at once to the call made upon them, and
within a time comparatively brief every one of : th*
sufferers was removed to a place where medical and
surgical assistance with tender and careful nursing
could be given. Nor was there any avoidable delay in
giving that aid. Considering that it was a public holi
day and that ph3*sicians like the rest of the citizens
were scattered about at various social or festal gath
erings, the promptness with which, they were gathered
to the post of duty was a striking illustration of how
effectively modern civilization has disciplined the
members of the profession in the work required of it.
Such accidents are unfortunately only too common
in the annals of mankind. Hardly does any great
national festival pass without leaving a record of dis
aster and death. In moments of joy men dismiss their
ordinary care, and when excited by the enthusiasms
of large crowds become thoughtless of danger. Thus
accidents in great cities upon holiday occasions fol
low one another in each succeeding j-ear : \vith unfail
ing regularity.' It is true they seldom occur upon a
scale of such magnitude or under circumstances so
direful as that which fell upon the spectators of the
football match from the roof. of the glass \vorks o on
Thanksgiving day, but still they are always calami
ties and teach through the fearful? lessons of sorrow
the need of the exercise of the greatest care on all
occasions ' and under- all circumstances that gather
light-hearted people in large numbers to some -scene
of popular festival or state ceremony.. ?
THE GLASS WORKS DISASTER.
OUT of the appalling disaster that turned
Thanksgiving festival in San Francisco from
a day of joy to a day of overwhelming grief
jn many a home our people will doubtless in good
time draw some lesson of benefit for the future, but
they cannot give heed to that lesson now. This is no
time for moralizing upon the causation of accidents
or the uncertainty Of human life. A:t present all hearts
are too tender in the soreness of .'sympathy for the
afflicted families to attend calmly to any cold, unsym
pathetic discussion of the calamity.! A direful tragedy
has befallen the city in its hour of-jby, and neither the
press to-day nor the pulpit to-morrow can utter any
other words than' those of inourning, joined with such
consolation as it is in the power O;f human sympathy
to offer to human sorrow. . : <
"While this story is interesting" in itself the. chief
interest is in the moral of it.-- Mr. Mclntosh li not the
only country edkor who' in season and out. of season
has advertised the resources of his community, and in
bad years or good years has urged his people -to keep
moving in the direction .of improvement. There is
not a single county in California that hÂ«s not an editor
who has done much of that kind of work. Our ex
changes sho.w how prompt country editors are to ad-'
vertise and promote anything that even so much as
promises good : for the community as a whole. These
men never get 'the praise the Georgia editor- is now
getting, but most of them. as fully deserve-it, and Cali
for'nians should be prompt in' giving it. . " ; .
The explanation is simple. A planter who was dig
ging a deep well in. search of pure water, free from
the unwholesome elements in the surface waters of
the country, tapped a vein from which an abundant
stream flowed forth. Here was proof that the country
is in an artesian belt. The country editor. took it up,
and week after week he preache'd artesian wells .until
they became numerous.. With their appearance sick
ness diminished. It was then: found that bad "water
had been almost the sole cause of ill Health; that. the
climate is really wholesome; that the odor. of the pines
in the air ; gave vigor to jyeak lungs,, and .then the
editor began to boom the country as a health-resort,
and he kept at it until a company built a tourist
hotel and people began to go from the North to spend
the winter there. To supply the hotels farmers began
to grow >fruit and vegetables and the soil was found
to be wonderfully fertile; then the editor urged the
planters to give, up cotton and. cultivate watermelons
and. truck gardens. They followed his advice, and
now the. country is getting rich., . ...
'Now, here is the surprise. The census shows that
this region has grown more rapidly than any other
part of rural Georgia. It has increased beyond all
other sections in population, in diversity of industry,
in commercial activity and in wealth. So marked has
been its superiority in progress during the decade
that public interest has been aroused and the sub
ject studied, with the xesult that the country editor has
become all at once a notable figure, for it is. con
ceded that he and his paper have been more influential
in promoting the progress of the community than any
other factors in it. .
The occasion of the praise given to Mr. Mclntosh
is the showing made in the census reports of the de
velopment that has taken place in the country around
Albany since 1890. That district in Southern "Georgia
was known in times past as the Georgia desert; or the
pine barrens. It is a low, flat land of sand and pine
trees; the water was unhealthy and the inhabitants
were afflicted with chills and fevers. Men of means
avoided it.- Rich planters owning the land of the
legion had their homes either on the coast where
healthful sea- breezes blew or in the mountains of
the northern part of the State. Few persons had any
confidence that it would ever be a fruitful and popu
lous region, and when the timber men began to cut
off the; pine trees, and so destroy the only visible
wealth "jbl the land, it 'was believed the time was not
far distant when the whole region would be com
paratively valueless and scantily inhabited. .
. T~""\ ARELY in this country and at this time does the
I-â/' editor of a country ; paper receive justice either
* Vat home or abroad. The value* of his work
for his community is not appreciated even when the
work itself is recognized. He. is .of the class of
prophets who are without public ; manifestations , of
honoreither in- their own country or elsewhere. He
is expected to serve his party,. his friends and all the
industrial, charitable and holiday .enterprises of the
county without; recompense; and his neighbors gen
erally deem it 'a. personal favor to him when! they pay
him for his paper. Such being the rule .in air parts
of the United States'/ any instance of. pubiic and gen
erous expression of a debt due from a country com
munity to an editor of .its "local paper /merits' : wide
circulation. Fpr that /reason we ".direct, attention to
the' praise now being 'jjjiven to Henry M. Mclntosh,
the editor of a paper in Albany, Georgia, * -'Â¦'
A COUNTRY EDITOR'S WORK
The Stratton law of 1899, proceeding
upon the theory that, no test for voters
was necessary, provided for only one bal
lot-box. It also limited participation at a
primary election to those parties which
had previously polled 3 per cent of the
total vote in the State or locality, where
as, in the previous law, in addition to
such parties, all political organizations,
filing a petition by 3 per cent of the quail
fled voters were admitted to participation
In the primary.
The law of 1899 was declared Invalid be
cause it so limited the parties which
cculd participate and It was also decided
that political parties had an Inherent
The Strattoa law of 1897 retained the
provision of the- act of 1895 as to a sepa
rate ballot-box for each political party,
but It was declared invalid by the Su
preme Court and among the grounds as
signed it was very clearly intimated that
the Legislature did not then have power
to prescribe and fix a test oath In the law.
At the session of 1895 several proposed
primary, laws , were presented. Judge
Spencer, chairman of the Election Com
mittee, requested me to prepare a com
mittee bill, which.' I did. The chief dis
cussion in committee arose over the pro
vision I had inserted, requiring a sepa
rate ballot-box, - labeled with the party
name, for each political party participat
ing, which was not in any other proposed
bill. The contention In favor of this pro
vision was Jhat one of the chief evils to
bo prevented was the custom at the old
system of primaries of Democrats voting
at Republican primaries and Republicans
voting at Democratic primaries, by which
the -unscrupulous elements commingled
and combined. It was argued that if all
parties voted at the same date and place
in the same ballot-box at a- party primary,
the "evil might often be increased, rather
than" diminished, as it could be carried out
without the shame" to which such acts
were exposed when dqne> openly where
old-fashioned â¢ primaries were held sepa
rately. Â¦'â¢ 'i. nis . view was adopted by the
committee and the act was reported in
the Assembly .as a general law. When it
reached a final vote Judge Spencer found
that the country members in the main felt
they did not need the law and would not
support it unless it was limited to San
Francisco and Los Angeles. The Judge
and myself both thought this course
would probably render the law unconsti
tutional, but as It could not then pass
otherwise. Judge Spencer so amended it,
and the Supreme Court declared it in
valid as being, local and special.
Editor of The Call: S|nce January. 1895,
three â¢ primary , election laws > have been
passed in this State and the next Legis
lature will enact another. Although we
shall have the guidance of three" Supreme
Court decisions and the recent constitu
tional amendment," the subject still pre
sents points of rare importance. In this
matter, especially, detail, or method, is of
the very essence of a just and effective
law. The Stratton law of 1899, in my Judg
ment, constitutes a good groundwork, but
the modifications called for by court de
cisions and permitted by. the amendment
referred to call for great care and will be
best illustrated by brief reference to the
previous enactments. , l.v
right' to existence -and could not b Â£ de
stroyed by having their delegates selected
by their opponents, as might be the case
where no test is providedat such a party
meeting or election. Â«Â«-.n
Now. the new amendment to the consti
tution permits the test to be Inserted m
the law or allows the law to provide that
the several political committees maj re
spectively prescribe a voting test for their
resT>ective parties at the primary; and
here will arise a matter of grave impor
tance. A test there must.be. and this or
necessity requires the provision of the act
of 1895. assigning a separate ballot-box to
each partyâ for a test would be a farce
where all parties vote In the same box.
It would not be a compliance with the
constitution. There will be those who will
want the law itself to prescribe the test.
Others will insist that this Is not feasi
ble and not elastic enough to meet tne
conditions of separate political organiza
tions, and that each party should be au
thorized to prescribe the test which the
conditions require. â¢ =
If divisions upon this point should be
found strenuous It may be suggested that
political committees be given power to
prescribe the test for their respective
parties, subject to a limitation fixed in
the lawâ as, for Instance, that no test pre
scribed by any party shall prevent a per
son from voting in the box of such party
who declares that .he affiliated with such
party at the last general election and Is
now In affiliation with it. or if ha was not
a voter at the last general election that it
is his intention to support at the ensuing
election the political party in whoso box
he seeks to deposit his vote.
These suggestions are illustrations by
me and not necessarily the form of words
I might personally finally favor after full
hearing before a legislative committee.
My purpose now is to draw attention to
those points and crII out caieful expres
sion of judgment by previous considera
tion among legislators and others.
I find many excallent men are sensitive
to taking an oath as to future political,
action. The" test required by the act of
1837 was in effect an oath of present in
tention to support the candidates nomin
ated by the delegates which were elected
at the primary- In a body of nearly one
hundred men from, various 'parts of the
State who retained me to carry that law,
before the' Supreme Court nearly all of
them said they would not take such an
oath, as they could have no real Intent to
vote for candidates until they knew who
they wers and what principles they fa
vored, i
The -remaining' details which will bÂ« new
In the law of 1901 will be" the prorislons
determining in what cities, counties and
cities and counties the official primary
shall be mandatory. After fixing the ter
ritory in which primaries must be held
under thÂ« law the question arles. Shall
this law be optional in other parts of the
State, and If so. in what manner shall the
option be exercised? Shall the local com
mittee of any one political party be able
to put it in operation In a given locality,
or shall It, in addition, require consent of
the Board of Supervisors or City or Town
Trustees, who provide for the expense.
or may, it be demanded upon petition of
a fixed percentage of the qualified voters
of such locality? These questions of im
portant detail were not voted upon by
the people and Â¦will require careful
thought at Sacramento before final ac
tion. THOMAS V. CATOR.

If it is a good thing not to do our ocean transpor
tation, why would it not also be a good thing not to
do our. own transportation by land? This coast owes
its development to railway transportation that was
.constructed by Government aid in land and a loan of
credit. Does the Colusa Sun think that was- a bad and
profitless thing to do? Would it have us go back to
the transportation conditions that were superseded
by rail? . V"
Has. not every industry and every acre of land made
a profit far beyond its share contributed to se
cure tjiat system of transportation? Our railways
were aided nationally and municipa.lly upon the right
theory that each man who contributed as a Â¦ tax
payer got his money back and a. permanent dividend
â¢on his- investment. .If this .were true, and it is true,
of out., railroad- system, it must also be true of our
merchant marine and deep water transportation. 7
We .do not think that Democrats like Stephen A.
Douglas, WilHam L. Marcy, Levi Woodbury, De
Witt Clinton, Le\Vis Cass, Albert Gallatm and Rob=
ert J." Walker would have hesitated a moment if they
had been brought face to face with the" conditions
which have given us the largest foreign trade in the
world without our own merchant marine to carry it
to market.
The building of our American roads has employed
millions of American workmen. It has employed
other immense numbers in the manufacture of their
equipment Take out of our industries those that
build locomotives, cars and wheels, and manufactura
steel rails, and an industrial paralysis would fall upon
the land. Yet all of this mighty structure of American
activity was built upon Government recognition, aid.
and encouragement. What the advocates of a re
vival of American shipping ask is that this Govern
ment do for ship-building, and blue water transporta
tion what it did for land transportation. Our railroads
carry our commercial surplus to the seaboard and
then it is taken for marine transportation by foreign
ships, built in foreign shipyards and manned by for
eign sailors. We pay foreigners now in freights over
$200,000,000 a year. Is it good business sense to deny
the right of this Government to pay a subsidy, of $10.
000,000 a year for ten years, that ships may be built
in American, yards, by American workmen, to 'be
owned and manned by Americans, to carry- our sur
plus to its market and save to our own people arid
our own industries the vast sum that we now pay an
nually to foreign ship-owners?
When it was seen that the settlement of the West
depended upon building railroads, the public domain
was given to those enterprises. The first great grant
was secured to the Illinois Central through the efforts
of Stephen A. Douglas. We need not remind the
Democrats of to-day that he was a leader of their
party, nor that their rational conventions demanded
Government aid, by subsidy, for the construction of
an overland road to the Pacific Coast.
We have the largest seacoast mileage of any of the
nations. We have a greater number of seaports and
harbors, and we produce more surplus of all articles
of commerce, that must seek a market abroad, than
any other people. With all this interest in blue water
shipping we have lost our supremacy of the seas.
Our people have parted with .their seafaring spirit.
Sailing the oceans is practically abandoned by Amer
icans. How are they to be redirected into that
channel for the profitable employment Â¦" of their
energies? Primarily it is a question of transportation,
by sea, of our own merchandise. Our, land transpor
tation is the best and cheapest in the world. It.em
ploys a million of men in its various departments. It
is one of the great wage and profit paying industries
of the country. In its development it was ., constantly
the recipient of some form of public help. In its very
beginning it found a. difficulty that it could not sur
mount without 'Government assistance. Our first rail
roads were blocked by the impossibility of securing
right of way for their lines. It was discovered that
construction of an extensive system was impossible
if railroad builders had to bargain with each individual
landholder for the right to build a line across his pos
sessions. While this difficulty lasted capital would
not invest in railroads. Beginning in New England,
this question was fought out. It divided parties first
in New Hampshire, where finally railroad corpora
tions were given the power of condemnation under
the right of eminent domain, in recognition of their
quasi-public character, and the public necessity for an
improved transportation system. Then development
began, and was continually aided by loans of the
public credit and by gifts, outright, of State and mu
nicipal bonds.
7 ""HE Colusa Sun has stated, ably and fairly, the
opposition to Government aid in the rebuilding
of our merchant marine. Its position is simply
that such aid is the extension of the American policy
of protection to that industry and business.
In view of the results of pur moderate system of
tariff support of American industries, one need not
run away when its application is proposed for the
benefit of such an important industry as ship-build
ing. But is this opposition on right lines? Is the
analogy complete?

Newspaper Accuracy.
It is given to newspapers to be accurate
âand to become true. Accuracy is fae;
up to the hour of going to press. Truth
is fact in final form. The appearance of
a paper every day enables it to correct
its errors oftener and more promptly than
a clergyman can correct his, for he baa
to wait till the next Sunday. And the
strong paper is less controlled by adver
tisements or parties than the average
preacher is by the drift or shift of pew
rents/ In neither case is the control nec
essarily "bad." A great many editors and

Lamb's true humor, however, is seen In

describable, "like the flavor of quince"; It
is diffusive and Impossible to quote; it
plays about a subject with" a sort of lam
bent gleam, never bursting Into boisterous
flame, never completely dying out. It is
always kindly, always half pathetic. Says
a well-known critic after speaking of the
crowd of jesters that filled the period with
their noisy clatter:
"We quit their uproarious laughter for his
more quiet and pensive humor with somewhat
of the same feeling that we leave the noisy
though amusing highway for the cool landscape
and the â¢ toft greensward. We reflect as we
smile; the malice of our nature Is rather laid
to rest than called forth; a kindly and forgiv
ing temper is excited. | We rise from his works,
if not with any general truth more vividly
Impressed, yet prepared by gentle and almost
Imperceptible touches to be more social In our
companionship* and warmer in our friend

' No Quotation can give an adequate idea
of the variety and the quality of Lamb's
humor. We will choose almost at ran
dom his description of Mrs. Battle as a
whist player:
"When J'outhey becomes as modest as hiu
predecp-^rr. Milton, and publishes - his epics
In duodecimo. I will read "em."
"The greatest pleasure I know is to do a
good action by stealth and to have It found
out Â¦ by Â¦ accident." . , V],,

of Tftwjtry and criticism. They Impend over
the town and are threatened to fall In the

"Coleridge Is an archangel a little damaged
in the ir.aking."
was present, as one of the circle declared,
"Argument, wit, humor, criticism were
hushed; the pertest, smartest and the
cleverest felt that all were assembled to
listen." He was never witty, but he was
an Inexhaustible fountain of wisdom and
inspiration. . Here at times came Words
worth, who deserves mention in a history
of the humorists as the man having, with
the single exception of Milton perhaps,
the smallest sense of humor of all the
English poets. Godwin, the philosopher,
a man equally deficient in huroor, was a
constant visitor, as were'Hazlltt and
Southey and the versatile Leigh Hunt. In
the place of Garrick eat Charles Kemble,
brilliant and chivalrous, and In Gold
smith's place was the whimsical, kindly
hearted Lamb, stammering out puns and
fantastic Jokes, the life and soul of the
company. . â¢ . /
Lamb's stammering:, which was by no
means affected, increased greatly the ef
fectiveness of his sallies. Laughable as
these are as we read them to-day, they
were tenfold more telling when, with pain
ful smile and stammering effort, he first
twisted them out for the delight, of his
Â¦guests. According to Hazlitt, one of ihe
circle, "he always made the best pun and
the best remark in the course of the even
ing. No one ever stammered out such fine,
piquant, deep, eloquent things in a half
dozen half-sentences as he does. His jests
scald like tears, and he probes a question
with a play on words."
"Charles." asked Coleridge, "have you ever
heard me preach?"
"I n-n-never heard you do anything else,
was the reply.
"Brandy and water," he maintained, "spoiled
two thingsâ brandy and water."
"Oh. yes," he once retorted, "W-W-Words
worth undoubtedly could have wrlttten â¢Ham
let''If he had the ' m-mind."
"Mr. Lamb." said one "of his employers at
the India House, "you come very late every
morning." "I do, sir," said Lamb, " but 1
make ud for it by going away very early
every afternoon."
Lamb's letters overflow with wit and
good humor. Beneath his Jokes there Is
always a basis of keen observation and
sound criticism. There have been few
keener observers of men and few saner
critics. A few extracts from letters will
illustrate:
WASHINGTON. Nov. 80.â L-leutenant
Commander L. H. H. Southerland, the of
ficer In charge of the naval militia, has
made a special report to the Navy Depart
ment upon the operations of that organi
zation during the past year.
Twenty States are shown to have an or
ganized naval militia, comprising in all
567 officers and 5309 petty officers and en
listed men. The naval appropriation act
allotted the sum of $60,000 for the militia,
of which 557,000 was distributed on Jan
uary 1 last among the twenty. State or
ganizations. The Navy Department as
signed two vessels for the practice cruises
of the militia, the Prairie on the Atlantio
and the Michigan on the great lakes.
Through lack or facilities a vessel, for the
Pacific seaboard was not assigned. Con
tingents from Louisiana, Georgia, Penn
sylvania, New Jersey. Connecticut, Rhode
Island and Maine took short cruises of
about a week's ' duration on the Prairie
and the organizations of Ohio, Michigan
and Illinois made practice trips on the
Michigan. . These cruises developed a
great deal of energy, ability and zeal
among the officers' and a like efficiency,
together with a high state of discipline,
among the enlisted men.
- Lieutenant Commander Southerland sets
forth an array of <acts to make obvious
the absolute necessity of a national
naval reserve, in addition to the present
militia organizations, calling particular
attention to the fapt that this proposed
Innovation is not suggested with any view
whatever of displacing;- the pitesent naval
militia. The General Government of the
United States, says Commander Souther
land, has no direct control whatever over
these naval - militia bodies. They are
State organizations pure and simple, or
ganized under State laws, and thus It Is
that lnÂ« the event of war- no member is
under any obligation to answer a call of
the President for any naval service. Then,
too. It is pointed out that our opponent in
a possible war of the future | may "be a
thoroughly equipped, first rate power, in
striking contrast to our adversary of 1S9S.
and that therefore it behooves the Navy
Department to create some sort of reserve
force, organized under : the provisions of
Federal law and operating under the di
rect â¢ control of the Navy Department,
â¢ ready -at a moment's notice to reinforce
the regular.flghtingeStrength of the navy.
.The status of the Naval Reserve officer
would be well defined. He would Jiold a
commission in the navy signed by the
President and his name would be borne
on- the naval register. The primary, in
fact the spfc object of the first naval re
serve, therfcport says, would be the' plan
ning .of the fleet," while 'the overflow,
which; . would Â¦ form . the second reserve,
could "be utilized by, the Navy Department
in many kinds of special duty. .
v Captain C. H. Stockton, president of the
Naval War College, has submitted to the
Navy Department his annual report of thÂ»
work 'of that body during the year ended
October 30 , last. / Various problems were
dealt with. Including naval tactics, naval
reserve and war preparation, 6f the per

HOLLAND HOUSE AND TEMPLE LANE.
last -century," says Reid, "until the
opening years of Queen Victoria's reign,
few men in England of liberal proclivities
who had gaineu renown in art, literature,
politics or science failed to make ac
quaintance with Holland House and its
genial and patriotic owner." Lord Hol
land and hip most brilliant wife â the mag
nets which drew society to this "enchant
ed palace." as Sydney Smith termed it
were as marvelously gifted as any of
their guests. The host at those frequent
dinners, of which the letters of that
I period make such frequent mention, was
! a man most lovable and most brilliant.
Hl3 repartee and table witticisms are still
remembered. Xo man was ever quicker
at impromptus. Of Southey. the poet
he said:
' Our Laureate Bob defrauds the kins-
He takes his cash and does not sin*;
Yet on he iocs. I know not why,
. slnglnr for us â who do not. buy.
Lady Hollandâ beautiful. imperious,
tactful, cften sarcasticâ ruled the tabl*
with firm hand. Few dared withstand
her; Macaulay sank into silence at her
word. Smith, however, was sometimes
Incorrigible. "Sydney," she once com
Rirjided. '-'ring the bell." "Oh, yes." wu
the retort, "and ehail I sweep the room?"'
No one could be more outspoken. Lord
Rochester had remarkea that hÂ© had a
poem nearly through the press. "Dearj
dear," cried Lady Holland; "I am sorry to
hear that â can't you suppress it?"
The Dr. Johnson of this group was th%
phenomenal Macaulay â "a book in
breeches," as Smith once declared. Hia
vivacity and his enormous erudition made
him "the king of diners-out." "He ha*
the strength of ten men," declared Emer
son, who met him In London: "Immens*
memory, fun. fire, learning, politics, man.
ners and pride, and talks all the time In
a steady torrent." Like Johnson and-
Coleridge, he was the center of every
circle he entered.
"Macaulay Improves. Macaulay im
proves!" cried Sydney Smith. "I have ob<
served in him of late flashes ofâ silence.'*
The "sonorous vivacity" of this enormous
talker often nettled Smith, who found it
impossible often to> voice his own wit and
wisdom. "I wish I could write pcetry
like you. Rogers." he once complained:
I would write an 'Inferno,' and l would
put Macaulay among %a number of dis
putants and gag him!"
Another contemporary described him as
"slopping all over on every subject and
standing in the slops."
Macaulay's wit was as caustic and aa
ready as that of his critics. He once de
scribed Lord Brougham as "a kind of
semi-Solomon, /half-knowing everything
from. the>cedar to tne hyssop."
The wit and wisdom which flowed with
the wine at dinners at Holland House
were not rescued for later generations. A
few fragments have come down to as
enough to make us mourn that Boswells
appear so seldom In the annals of a lit
erature. How we would like to read the
table talk of a single evening when Fox
and Sheridan and Hook and Byron and
Sydney Smith and dozens of others, all
sat about the board! Of Smith's happy
hits and droll sallies we have a consider
able stock preserved in Lady Holland's
life of her father.
Xo- other Englishman ever so bubbled
over with wit and merry good nature.
Says Trevelyan. the biographer of Macau
lay: "He is full of wit, humor and
shrewdness. He is not one of those ahow
talkers who reserve all their good things
for special occasions. It seems to be his
greatest luxury to keep his wife and
daughters laughing for two or three hours
every day."
He once found a little boy in a lane
stroking a tortoise "to please it." "Child."
said the genial dean, "you might as well
stroke, the, dome of St. Paul's to please
the dean and the chapter."
The question of a wooden pavement
about the cathedral once arose In the
chapter for discussion. "Ah." said Smith.
with his usual matter-of-fact tone. "If,
my reverend brethren here will but lay
their heads together the thing will be
done in a trice.
One day the conversation turned upon
an obstinate man who was full of preju
dices. "You might," said Smith, "as well
attempt to poultice the humps off a
camel's back.
"Daniel Webster," he declared, "struck,
me much like a steam engine in trousers."
Of the historian Prescott he once ex
claimed, "When he comes to England a
Caspian Sea of soup awaits him."
"Of course." he once remarked, "if ever
I so to a fancy ball at all I should go as
a aispenter."
"My living in Yorkshire was so far out
of the way that it was actually twelve
miles from a lemon."
"The dean of ." he declared.-, "de
serves to be preached to death by wild
curates."
"No, I don't like dogs," he said at one
time. "I always expect them to go mad.
A lady asked me once for a motto for her
Spot. I proposed 'Out. damned Spot!" buc
she did not think it sentimental enough.
You remember the story of the French
marquise who, when her pet lapdog bit a
piece out of her foqlman's leg, exclaimed:
'Ah,' poor little beast! I hope it won't
make him sick.' I called one day on Mrs.
, and her lapdog flew at my leg and
bit it. After pitying her dog. like the
French marquise, sÂ»he did ail she could to
comfort me Tby assuring me the dog was
a dissenter and hated the church ana was
brought up in a Tory family."
Examples might be multiplied Indefinite
ly of Smith's ready wit. His contributions
to the Edinburgh Review, which are nu
merous, overflow with happy hits, satiric
touches and merry jokes. Despite his
brilliancy he left behind him no single
masterpiece upon which his fame can rest.
His literary energies were expended al
most wholly upon discussions of timely
topics, upon reviews and criticisms, most
ly of an ephemeral nature.
Yet Smith was not a mere Jester like
Theodore Hook.\ Edward Everett, who
once listened to his table-talk, declared
that If Smith "had not been known as the
wittiest man of his day be would have
been accounted one of the wisest." He
was not a caustic wit, like Pope and
Swift. In the words of his biographer.
"No more kindly humorist ever breathed
than Sydney Smith, and the fact that
though be was armed with so sharp a
weapon, he went through life surrounded
by the love as well as admiration of those
who knew him best says a gTeat deal not
only for the goodness of his heart, but
also for his habitual self-restraint." Be
hind all cf his wit lay an immense fund
of practical wisdom. He saw quite through
men and measures, and he used his wit as
a weapon to attack what seemed to him
to be abuses and to relieve those op
pressed by injustice. A book of selections
might be made from his scattered reviews
an<3 letters that would be worthy to place
beside the best books of practical wisdom
in the language. His advice is eminently
full of common sense and eminently help
ful. . Â¦ - .
He discusses most delightfully the three
"fallacies of society"â "Fallacy one,- be
cause I have sone through it, my son shall
go through It also; fallacy two, I have
said I will do it. and I will do Itâ I will
stick to my word; fallacy, three, I object
to half measuresâ it Is neither one thing
nor the other."
"I always say to young people." he
writes, "beware of carelessness; no- for
tune will stand it long. You are on the\
high road to ruin the moment you think I
yourself rich enough to be careless."
"Never give way to melancholy; resist
it steadily, for the habit will encroach. I
once gave a yor.ng lady two and twenty
receipts against melancholy; one was a
bright fire, another to remember all the
pleasant things said to and of her. an
other to keep a box of sugar plums on the
chimneyplece : and a kettle simmering on
the hob; take short views, hope for the
best 'and trust' in. God; reverence and
stand in awe of yourself; don't be too se
vere on yourself and your own failing;
keep on; don't faint; be energetic to the
last/'guMSM
Such a warm-hearted, courageous, sun
ny optimist is like a spring in the desert.
like a glorious day in midwinter. We join
in his full, hearty laugh; we listen to his
sound philosophy, and we forget our sor
rows, our petty grievances, our suspicions
and morbid Imaginings. We breathe a full
breath' from the .vast, free-aired, life-giv
ing, elemental spaces, and we are renewed

by Judge Lorijjan in the following scath

is of such a serious nature that the court
has allowed a wide latitude in the trial
and sentence.. The charge of which you

Gamble, the 11-year-old daughter
of J. A. Gamble.
The case was one of the mo6t sensa

Mrs. Gamble, the girl's mother, when she
heard of the fato of her daughter, aroused
the people, to a high pitch. At first It was

On' August 2o last as Grace Gamble and
two young brothers were on their way

in alarm to her mother, and the wretch
whipped up the horse. He then drove Into
a vacant field some distance away and
subjected the girl to the most brutal treat

may be a conference of all the Republican
members of the House of Representative*

betore it is formally reported by the Com
mittee on Way and Means.
According to the original programme
the bill was to have been submitted to a
meeting of the full membership of the
Committee on Ways and Means to-mor

Republicans, however, it was not certain
that the Republicans would.be In the ma

strongly pressed for the vacancy on the
Committee on Ways and Means, caused
bv the resignation of Mr. Dolliver. If
Idr. Babcock should be appointed it Is ex
pected that he will stand out for the re
duction of the beer tax in the interest of
the brewers of Milwaukee, who supported
the Republican ticket in the recent cam
paign. â¢ \v
Such features of the new. measure .pre
pared by the Republican members- as
have become known, together with omis
sions that the committee have made In
the proposed reductions, have caused con
siderable opposition and it Is probable
that a conference or caucus of the Repub
lican members will be held before a final
decision is reached. The greatest oppo
sition that has developed comes from the
brewing interests. Representatives from
districts where a great deal of beer is
manufactured are making serious protests
against the action of the committee in not
reducing the tax on beer. There are
some other interests also which are mak
ing protests and the Republican members
of the House h ave telegraphed their
friends on the Ways and Means Commit
tee that they think the proposed bill
should be changed. The fact that the ma
jority in the present House Is only six

that a bill must be supported by practical
ly the entire Republican membership in
order to pass. . If General Grosvenor ar
rives to-morrow it is possible that the Re

make a request for a caucus to be held
early next week.

THE SA1ST FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1900.

Â¦ --.Â¦â¢ : *
' During the first third of the nineteenth
century English wit and humor found Its
soul and center In two widely different
circlesâ one supping weekly In the humbla
rooms-of Charles and Mary Lamb, the
o.ther dlnirig frequently at Holland House,
with the roost brilliant surroundings and
the most eminent list of guests which the
period could furnish. In each of these
groups one man stood pre-eminent as. a
wit ,-. and a merry soul â Charles Lamb,
quaint and lovable, perhaps the most gen
uine of all English humorists, and Sydney
Smith, brilliant, philosophical, "the wit
tiest of Englishmen."
Lamb's weekly suppers had In them
much to remind one of the early meetings
of the Literary Club. They were delight
fully Informal; one might come and go as
he pleasedâ ml<ht eat with the young and
hungry', or sit by "a clear fire and a clean
hearth" and play his rubber of whist in
stead. There was no skillful general like
Lady 'Holland to command the conversa
tion, to keep it Incessant and varied and
ever brilliant, to say with a tap of her fan
on the table, "Now, Macaulay, we have
had enough of this; give us something
else," to steer from dangerous points and
to rule the board with diplomatic skill. At
Lamb's, as at Goldsmith's in the earlier
days, all was freedom and comradeship
and good feeling. The talk that rattled
about the whist tables and over the cold
mutton was the most spontaneous and
natural in all the world.
As we. view Jt to-day it was no common
group that gathered at Temple Lane.
Here, In the place which a half-century
earlier would have been occupied by the
great Johnson, sat the Inspired Coleridge,
the/ man who attempted to cover the en
tire field of human knowledge, and vet,
in the words of Do Qulncey. who "finished
nothing but his sentences.'' Whenever he

ST. PAUL, Nov. 30.â Much interest is

be-. ve^y simple,' for then the Republicans
can fight" it out without; any one having
an advantage.: However, -1ft the Governor,
who was until four â¢ years ago a leading
Republican; should . appoint a Republican
to the vacancy with the idea that the term
is so short that it i would. serve no party
end to name a ! Democrat the | Republican
legislators anticipate that - such an :Â¦ ap

STOCKTON, Nov. 30.-On.e of those pe
culiar shooting affairs not infrequent in
the Italian colony occurred shortly after
midnight last night on the lower Sacra
mento road. The gun wtelder was David
Bartolas, a saloonkeeper of this city. Ac
cording to his story his home was entered
by v.u u l glars We< 3needay night and he was
robbed of $400 of his own money and $300
in stocks and certified checks belonsrlnir
.to his barkeeper.
At midnight, so he says, he heard some
one attempting to come into his house by
the front door. Bartolas arose and hast
ily graspir.g a shotgun which was stand
ing near the head of his bed he advanced
into the hallway. He saw some one in
the act of coming through his front door
and he fired. The person turned to run
and the saloonkeeper fired the other bar
rel. A scream followed the second shot
and Bartolas recognized the voice as that
of his wife. The poor woman ran a dis
tance of 150 feet to the house of a neigh
bor and her husband followed. He \helped
to carry her indoors and lay her on a bed
at the same time protesting that he did
not know it was she when he shot.
Drs. Hammond and Cross atttended the
woman. They found that â¢ the charge of
shot had taken effect in her right breast.
The woman is an Italian and Is unable to
speak English. She intimated to the phy
sicians that the shooting was an accident.
Bartolas has not yet been placed In jail
and it is possible that he will Â«not- be
prosecuted.
Mrs. Bartolas was resting easily at a
late hour this afternoon and her physician

WINNEMUCCA, New, Nov. 2O.-West
bound freight train 205 was wrecked here
this evening and Fireman J. F. Jones In-
The train was pulled by two huge mogul
engines and was entering the yard when
both engines Jumped the track at a split
switch. Seven cars loaded with rails and
coal followed the engines Into the ditch
and were completely demolished. The
head engine is a mass of twisted and bent
Iron, only the boiler remaining whole. The
second engine stands upright thirty feet
from the track, being half buried in the
sand. It was on this engine that Fireman
Jones met a horrible death. He was
caught In the gangway between the en
gine and tender and literally ground to
pieces. yr~ *
Nothing short of a miracle saved the
engineers and firemen, none of them being
seriously hurt. Old railroad men shud
dered when viewing the fearful havoc
wrought by the moguls, and say that only
the intervention of Divine Providence
eaved the whole crew from a fearful
death.
All trains are blocked and it will take
many hours to clear the track so that
traffic can be resumed.
The cause of the wreck has not yet
been settled upon and the railroad men
will give out no information.

damage than the navy can repair out of
the available appropriations Congress will
be asked to make a specific appropriation
for relief of the destitute islanders,

from Rossland says that Justice .Walkem

Conner assaulting Langley with -an ax,
crushing In his skull and most horribly
mutilating him. Langley is in' such a

SPOKAXE. Wash.. Nov. SO. -Four lives
were lost here this evening by the cap
sizing of a ferry-boat in the Spokane
Ri\ r er. The ferry is about two miles down
the river. The boat was crossing the
etreÂ«m with eighteen working men who
had ended their day's labor In a construc
tion camp n^ar the Great Northern's new
bridge. The men crowded to the bow tnd
it was forced under the swift current and
the boat was swamped. All the men were
thrown in the cold water. Five swam to
ehore and the othpre climbed on the cap
eized boat. The waves ran high and
washed four of thrm off to death. The
dead:
L. SIMONS, colored.
JACK LOVETT.
Two unknown Italians.
When the ferry capsized a man started
off in a skiff to the rescue. Some of the
men who witnessed the accident say he
picked up one of the men in the -water,
but neither the rescuer nor the skiff hPb
f'nee been seen. It was probably carr'ed
down the rapids and it is possible that the
two men have reached shore some dU
tancÂ« below.
Another account says the boat was
overturned by a large log.

FRESNO, Nov. 30.â P. C. Kanawyer. a
forest ranger, shot and Instantly killed J.
C. Collyer In the lobby of the Grand Cen
tral Hotel. In this city, at 6:30 o'clock to
night.
About six months ago Collyer was post
master at Millwood. He appointed Mr?.
Kanawyer his deputy and shortly after
left her in charge of the office and went
to the State of Washington, where he
took up his residence.
Three weeks ago a- shortage was dis
covered in the accounts of the office and
an investigation followed. Collyer was
communicated with and he claimed If
there had been any irregularities they had
occurred since he had left Millwood.
Lately he left Washington and arrived In
Fresno last Friday. He came to await
the results of the Investigation and effect
a settlement. To-night, as he sat in the
Grand Central Hotel, reading a paper,
Kanawyer entered the room with his son.
He was seeking a man whom he believed
to be stopping at the hotel and went Im
mediately to the register, which he com
menced to look over. Collyer looked up
and saw him and at once arose and went
toward him. The men shook hands and
commenced a conversation. They drifted
at once to the subject of the shortage at
Millwood. Collyer reiterated the statement
that if any irregularity existed it had oc
curred since he left the office. Kanawyer
called him a liar and the reply was two
blows, one of which felled tho Millwood
man to the floor. Collyer Jumped on htm
and commenced to pound him. Bystanders
Interfered and soon had the men parted.
Kanawyer broke away from those who
were restraining him and. pulling a re
volver, fired at Collyer. The bullet passed
through him, cutting the carotid artery.
Blood spurted from the wound and death
was almost Immediate. Kanawyer made
no attempt to get away and: was shortly
afterward placed under arrest.
The body of Collyer. was taken to the
undertaking establishment of Hall &
Cate, where It now lies.
For hours after the tragedy occurred
crowds thronged the Grand Central, and
the greatest excitement prevailed. Both
men were well known here. Collyer at one
time was a Deputy v Sheriff of Fresno
County. Â¦

aren't good they will have to have a new

most turbulent spirits.

youngsters are now the banner display of
the Sunday school. *Â¦
The children themselves realize the im
portance of their position, and have a
vague idea that the picnics, socials and
other entertainments given by the Sun
day school are really in their honor. At
a picnic recently given, one pair of twins
asked Miss Cox if it wasn't "just for their

Nearly all cheap cough mixtures and
throat lozenges contain opiates; these*
cheap medicines give a temporary relief,
especially with little children, by deatroy-
ing: nerve sensation; the Irritation In
throat, which causes coughing', is tem-
porarily removed, not by. removing' the
cause, but by deadening the nerves of
feeling the Irritation is not felt although
It 13 still there and will promptly return.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is the beÂ«
remedy jto remove cataxrhal secretion,
wllether in the nose, throat or stomach,
because they are composed of whole-
some antiseptics like Kucolyptol, Guaia-
col, Sanguinaria and Hydrastin; when you
use these tablets yoa know what you are
putting into your system and not taJting:
chances with cocaine, opiates or similar
poisons found in so many catarrh cures
and cough medicines.
Dr. Ramsdell in commenting on catarrh
cure* says: "I can heartily recommend
Stuart's, Catarrh Tablets, because thejr
contain no cocaine nor other dangerous
drug found In so many advertised ca-
tarrh cures. I have known of many cases
of Ions standing catarrh of the head and
throat completely cured by the* daily use
of these tablets for several weeks. One
case In particular, which I could not
reach with an Inhaler or spray and where
the catarrh caused daily headaches and
a noticeable loss of hearing was entirely
cured by this harmless but effective
remedy."
Dr. "VVainwrlgrht says: "I never hesitate
to prescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for
catarrhal headaches and catarrhal deaf-
ness because I know them to be perfectly
safe for child or adult and have seen
many remarkable cures resulting from
their regular daily use; because they are
advertised and sold in drugstores IÂ» no
reason why any good physician should
not use them, because we should seize
upon the means of cure wherever found "
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are especially
valuable for catarrhal -colds In children
because they are pleasant to the ta3te
and may be used freely to break up severa
colds a"nd croup at the very beginning.
All druggists sell the remedy at 50 cents

BOrLEB . ORDINANCE
UPHELD BY OOTJRT
Not Discriminative on Its Face and
the Remaining Issue One of
Fact. V*-/:
United States Circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday dismissed the habeas corpus appli
cation of George Tsukamoto and remand
ed the applicant to the custody of the
Sheriff. Tsukamoto'is a Japanese laun
dryman doing business at the corner of
Ban Jose avenue and Twenty-third street.
He made application to' the Board of Su
pervisors for a permit to erect and main
tain a steam boiler on the premises. It
being a residence neighborhood a lengthy
protest was filed with the "Supervisors,
and the permit was refused.- Tsukamoto
erected the boiler anyhow, and was con
victed and sentenced to a term of lmpris
onraent. Â¦ Â¦:Â»Â¦
' His attorneys applied to the United
States Circuit Court for a writ of habeas
corpus, contending the city ordinance un
der which he was convicted was uncon
stitutional because It discriminated
agalnBt persons of the "applicant b race,
and that In the enforcement of the or
dinance the city authorities discriminated
In favor of white persons.- Both these
propositions were controverted by the at
torneys for the city.
Judge Morrow held that the ordinance
on Its face was not discriminative.
Whether or not the city had discrim
inated against the petitioner In Its en
forcement was a question of fact, which
thÂ© court had no authority to determine
In a habeas corpus proceeding.
The Supervisors* Judiciary Committee
reported yesterday in favor of accepting
a grant of the option of the People's Mu
tual Telephone Company's franchise with
out the payment of any consideration, the
city reserving to itself all rights over the
franchise. The City Attorney, however,
will first determine the legality of such a
grant, aÂ» he had advised that the clause
in. the agreement, providing for the pay
ment of $1 would necessitate the submis
sion of the proposition to the people to be
voted on.' ' " J ffJ'ff9flWBHH
C."I*. Crittenden, president of the Peo
ple's Mutual Telephone Company, said he
was willing that the city should take the
option as a gift..
"There Is no^question of the validity of
the franchise," said Crittenden, "and eev r
eral attorneys employed by proposed pur
chasers of the company's bonds have so
reported. ' We "have contracts with 7000
firms and corporations now that will pay
us 1360,000 per year. It will be a great ad
vantage to the city to buy the option and
will not prevent the â¢ municipality from
bulldlngr another telephone system if it so

who represented the Seventieth Assembly
District in the Thirty-second and Thirty
third regular sessions of the Legislature
and subsequently served in the extra ses
sioh, was re-elected to the Assembly by
an increased majority at the late general
election. He edits the Pasadena Daily
News and speaks his mind concerning the
Speakership. On this subject the News
or November 28 eays:
The next move on the political checker board
of California is for the election of a Speaker
of the Assembly for the coming session of the
Legislature. This matter ham been deliberately
canvassed by' tha News and we have come to
the conclusion that Hon. Alden Anderson of
Sulsun, Solano County, should be re-elected to
that responsible position. He has been tried
In the crucible of experience and has been
found true, worthy 'and capable. '^SafJ*)^
- In January, 18Â»7, the writer entered the As
sembly with Mr. Anderson. 1 Wo served on two
Important committees together. He waa al
ways to be depended on to do what was right.
When that famous raid on those bribe-exposing
coyote scalp telegrams which were being sent
out of the State was made Anderson was the
man who stayed up In the fog all night at
Sacramento to do his duty at daybreak, and
all the power of the Western Union Telegraph
and Wells-Fargo corporations could not swerve
him one lota.
In 1399 Mr. Anderson was made Speaker. In
that long, trying session, when the Senatorial
storms were raging furfi#cly, Mr. Anderson
presided with marked ability and Impartiality.
Xo breath pf scandal or suspicion touches any
thing ever done by him.
There is every reason why such a man should
be re-elected. It raises the reputation of thÂ©
California Legislature and marks It with an
air of honesty and straightforward business.
Although California may have such a majority
this year for McKinley as may make some
Republicans overconfident and reckless, yet
the News fears that unless the .Republican
party in California proves true to the trust.
Imposed In It and rises equal to Its opportu
nities in giving a good and wise government
of this State, the campaign of 1902, when a
United States Senator, Governor and other
State and county officers are to be elected, may
not prove so satisfactory. â¢ The re-election of
Alden Anderson Speaker is a move In the di
rection of wise 'government and Republican
victory in" 1932..
The re-election of Mr. Anderson would not be
the triumph of any faction in the party. Ha
is a close friend of Governor Gage and would
be in touch with him in his heroic efforts to
redeem Republican party pledges for an hon
est and economical administration of State af
fairs. The editor of the News is second to no
man in giving Governor Gage full credit and
praise for his faithful administration of State
affairs. And we believe that the re-election of
Mr, Andei son as Speaker will uphold the Gov
ernor's hands.
In the diplomatic task of presiding over tha
Assembly during that bitter Senatorial con
test, Mr. Anderson has Always good words
to say of Colonel Burns, General Barnes, Sen
ator Bulla and Mr. Grant. While standing pat
for what he believed his constituents wanted,
he treated all Impartially and fairly.
That he did right is demonstrated by the
nearly doubled majority with which he, was
re-elected to the Assembly in that Nineteenth
District on the 6th of November.
Mr. Anderson has made many trips over
Southern California. He Is familiar with the
needs of Southern California and its institu
tions and is broad-minded enough to treat all
sections of the State squarely and impartially.
The editor of the News, as the Assemblyman
from this Seventieth District, supports Mr. An
derson voluntarily and without any promise of
and kind. We do It because we favor a man
who has been tried in the balance and who
has been found full weight and not wanting.
There are those who think that under all
circumstances and in all occasions a Southern
California man should be supported, and they
ory for harmony and for unity.
But the News holds that in cases Ilka this,
where an experienced man can be had to pre
side over a body where such a vast accumula
tion of business is to be done in so short a
time, then we should stale sectionalism for the
good of the whole State. Indeed, by doing so,
we harmonize all sections of the State and all
factions in the party, so the greatest good may
come out of tha Legislature In tha very short
est time.
There are other aspirants for this position,
but none that have the experience and have
been tried as has been Hon. Alden Anderson
of Solano County. Let us re-elect him. ,
- The Pasadena News also expresses the
hope that Senator Thomas Flint Jr., who
has served the State In the Senate of the
Legislature for twelve yearB. will bo re
elected President pro tern, of the Senate
without opposition. Senator Flint la
spoken of as one of the cleanest and most
capable officers In the State.

Food cooked with it is whole-

NEW YORK, Nov. SO.-There war a large
tusines* dore in stocks aca.n to-day, but the
activity -wat- nix well maintained throughout
the session. Ttje Â«urface indications were that
tfcÂ» larfe early business wai for Lrndyn ac
count. For ins-aree. the ptices-oX Amfirictris
advanced In London btfore theÂ° opening; here.
This was in spite of the general heavlnses of
the !><KKlon market,- due to the-Â°njoney market
conditions and to the discouraging news-, from
Fouth Africa. But after the opening her* for
eign arbitrage brokers were sellers of stocks
*rd their fcties on balence tcr, to-day' were es
timated at 40,00m shares. TJie inference lt>
pretty plain th*t London's early advance waa
on New York buying, while the genuine Lon
don trar.sactlonÂ« in this market were on the
wiling Â«ide. The>- had little influence- on
prices, %vhich went to the best generally after
the arbitrage operations had ceased. The ln-
Huence of . thÂ« mid-week Interruption Â» of
Thanksgiving was still manifest to-day. There
was much closing up of accounts on Wednes
day and there was general Indisposition to re
open them to-day for a day and a half.- With
the exception of Rome continued large touring
in seme quarter* cf the railroad llet. the trad
ing wm, however, lanruld. especially during
the latter part of the day. A firmer tendency
of the money market and a rise' In the call
lo&n rate to 4hi v*r <*ent late In the day were
alBO an Influence toward repressing activity. <
Prices of otocks were affected by the riws
in the money rate, but there were substantial
rallies in epcts and the closing was firm but
rot Â«t the best. In the railroad list etdeks of
Southern and Southwestern roads were notably
firmer, led by Chesapeake and Ohio,.whJclj got
up IH and closed at the top. The Chicago
and Altor. stocks rose strongly. The tobacco
etocks were' weak on the withdrawal of im
portant intf retts. Paciflc Mall reacted
ThÂ» American Smelting stocks were weak
early en an Alleg-ed project to organize an op
position, but . rallied etroniriy and dosed with
good net trains. The downward . course of
Amalgamated Copper was checked after an
early 4tclin<> and the stock has a net gain on
the day. ; The ete^l nocks were neglected all
<JÂ«y and they showed changes both ways. The
rxmd market was active and strong, with a
notable . demand for Kansas and Texas, Â£t.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Dealings at the New York Ktnck Exchr.nge
were emaller this week than at any , time
since the electlo". This was in part due to the
holiday on Thursday, .which cacurally liaJ a
tendency to rsstrict speculation. It naH. how
ever, noted â¢ that the falling iff In the velum*
of transactions was attended by a changed
character of the market, 'Indicated by a de
creased prominence on the part of the . ccm
mls?lon houses and more open evl Jence Â¦ that
manipulation was responsible tor the bullish
tendencies In many of the more prominent
stocks. The Irregularity of price3 seemed in
fact to proceed largely from, the absence -of
the eag.ir buying demand for :;iock.s on the
part of the public, which had been the niain
cause of the advance during the preceding fort'
night. Outside participation, - however, con
tinues on - a large Bcale, and a good deal Â¦ of
profit-taking was Indulged in. but - there was
no sign i of general liquidation. Excellent in
vestment buying is still noted, Â¦ particularly at
concessions, and declines, 'whether the result
of realising by speculative holders or of , the
Increased activity of bearish professionals seem
to rise in the appearance I of support and fresh
buying. - The board I room \ traders I were (some
what inclined to work ' for a reaction. I particu
larly when it was seen that, the fortnightly set
tlement at. London which* began on. Tuesday
revealed no such extensive short Interest Â¦ In
Americans as had been expected. It appears
in fact that the amount of this short Interest
In our stocks abroad had been exaggerated and
that the principal portion . of Â¦ It had been pre
viously covered. The London public, Indeed,
showed some disposition to buy American rails
this week, but the foreign selling apparently of
long stock continues on a scale which.' It ' is
held, accounts. for the strength and advancing
tendency of foreign markets. â¢ ; The New York
money market, however, takes no alarm â¢ at
the foreign selling, and the money market here
disregards both the firmness of discount rates
In London and the rise in foreign exchange.
Lost Saturday's bank statement waa accepted
as indicating: that ' money will . from now. - on
accumulate at New York . and the rates for
both time and call loans show an Inclination
to become easier, despite indications of a poor
statement to-day. This supports the feeling
on the part of the street at large that, in spite
of â¢ Its liability to be trregrular and to even
exhibit reactlono. the â¢ stock market " is likely
to continue In Its upward course for somo
time. â¢ _____ '

sheetings -advancing from "6c to 6. 20c, bleached
Dhlrtinga from 7.41c to 7.62c and brown sheeting
from 5c to 5.12c. There is little curtailment of
oi'tput of cotton 'goods, \ but some ' mills which
usually run on export trade are diverting ma
chinery to lightweights for home use.
Kailroad earnings for November to date show
1 per cent gain' over 1899 and 11.1 per cent^iver
189S. Good news continues to come from iron
and Bteel sections. Sales of plglron in three
â¢weeks have aggregated 200,000 tons at Chicago
and idle furnaces are going into blast, indicat
ing a much larger capacity than on November
1. Buying of all finished forms increases and
BÂ«me orders are placed at slightly higher quo
tations. Railroads are purchasing most liber
ally, and machinery is in special demand. As
yet the advance in . cotton goods is not at all
in proportion to the'gain In raw material. The
Â¦wool market is recovering from the shock of
heavy failures and sales at three chief Eastern
markets increased about 500.000 pounds for the
week, but prices ate somewhat easier, particu-^
larly for I the cheaper grades. - Abundant esti
mates that the cotton yield will not reach
10,000,000 bales failed to affect prices, for
traders are beginning to .appreciate . the fact
that a decrease in consumption is an unavoid
able concomitant of unusually high quotations.
Wheat is further from a dollar than at any
time since that price was predicted by a high
authority and the usual rumors of damage
from Jointing before -frost fall as fiat as they
have done in previous years. An ample corn
crop did not prevent a clever manipulator from
securing control of the available stocks at Chi
cago and forcing the price up to 51c for the
current month's delivery. Heavy receipts of
cattle at Chicago depress the price and the
average in this market for live beef fell to
$4 70. against $5 09 a year ago.
Commercial failures in November were 850 in
number and $12,300,316 in amount of liabilities,
against 782 in October for $9,072,791 and S86 in
November last year, when liabilities were only
$8,046,848. Manufacturing defaults were but 132
In number and <3,8S3,165 in amount, the bulk
of the mortality in trading concerns,
of which 617 failed for $7,506,858. There were
40 other commercial failures, with liabilities of
$ai0. 793. Four banking and financial companies
defaulted for $823,000. At first glance the No-^
vember statement appears very unsatisfactory,
but it must be remembered that a few heavy
failures 4n wool and other textile , industries
a ccount for a large share of the reported lia
bilities. Aside from this one branch of trade,
which has naturally- suffered heavily from the
tardy approach - of winter, the ..figures show
business to be on a good foundation.

their shoulders at both rumors , and say " that
the boom is over.. They think a reaction Is
probable, but admit that they see no signs
of an impending fall. â¢ The exchequer bonds

The feature in the grain markets this week
was the carrying to a successful conclusion of
the November corner in corn In Chicago. Fol
lowing the private settlement of the shorts at
a basis of 60c a bushel came a drop to 41c. At
K ew York the influence- of this cornerâ one of
the successful ; corners on - record â was to ad
vance prices slightly. Wheat has been irregu-'
lar, but with ; the undertone bearish because. of
large Bupplies/ and discouraged speculative
liquidation. â¢ : : /
Relatively . the best trade reports come from
the South and Â¦ Southwest, ' while the most

GERMAN LOAN
UNDER DISCUSSION
Secretary of the Treasury
Tells Why It Was Placed
in America.
BERLIN. Nov. 30.â In the Reichstag to
day during the'debate on the loan bills Dr.
von Thielmann, Secretary of the Imperial
Treasury, was asked why the lof.n for
80,000,000 marks was placed in America. He
replied that the German money market
in September was in an unfavorable con
dition, and the Government had been
urged to avoid doing anything to raise the
rate. Therefore it was considered desira
ble to draw money from America and
Great Britain, as they both had a great
abundance of cash, especially the United
States, and .the Government had to be
careful not to deplete the German money
market toward the end of the year.
Count von Kanltz, the Agrarian leader,
said he regretted the loan was not placed
in Germany. America, he added, might
easily become the banker of Europe.
Herr Busing, National- Liberal, observed
that patriotic heartburnings were unnec
essary. Great Britain had also placed a
loan in America. But in his opinion a
clause should have been inserted prohibit
ing America- from placing a loan in Ger
many. â¢ â¢
I Dr. von Thielmann. replying to the critl-.
clsrn. declared the apprehensions of Herr.
Busing were groundless. Should a scar
city of money occur in America, a con
tingency which after the re-election of
President McKjnley he did not fear.
"Americans would only be able to loan to
Germany at "a loss.
"I can assure Count Kanltz." concluded
Dr. Thlelmann. "that we did not run after
the Americans. They came to us."
. â¢ Dr. Arendt, secretary of the German
Bimetallic League, approved* placing the
loan abroad. He said its issue in America
protected the market from results of. dis
count. .
Heir Koch, president of the Imperial
Bank, also approved the way the loan wag
placed. He said he did not entertain fears
that the loan would be used by Americans
to draw gold from Germany.
v- Dr." von Siemens, president of the Na
tional Bank, said it was unnecessary to go
abroad for money.
'After further discussion the subject was
dropped. ,~ . . .

VAST SUM OF GOLD
IN TREASURY
Total Amount of the Precious
Metal Greater Than
Ever Before.
'WASHINGTON, Nov. 3O.-The largest
slock of gojd and bullion ever held In the
United States is now accumulated In the
treasury and its branches. The total has
been rising steadily during the whole of
the present year and Is now $474,108,336. or
about $76,000,000 greater than at the close
of 1*09. - Â¦ â¢ 4
This gold Is not all the direct property
of the United States, but it is held against
outstanding gold certificates. The amount
of these,. less the amount in the treasury
wnd its branches, was $230,775,S90 Wednes
day. â¢ All the remaining gold, amounting
to about 1243,000,000, belongs to the treas
ury as a. part of the reserve fund of $150,
000,000. . . Â¦ â¢. . Â«
â¢ 1 he influx of gold Into the treasury
comes partly from the new. dlscoverie3
on the Klondike and other mines, but its
.retention' is due to the pressure for cur
itncy, which leads to the acceptance of
Rold certificates and other paper money in
preference to coin. I The treasury recently
has been shipping small notes in large
quantities to - . New, Orleans, and other
points upon deposits of gold in the New
York sub-treasury by the New York re
serve agents-of 'the Southern banks.
The fact that. $474,108,336 la thus accumu
lated in a. sense tinder a, single authority
enables- an '.estimate to be made of some
of the other' visible gold resources of the

President of Canal Project
in Conference With
Secretary Hay,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3O.-President
Hutin of the Panama Canal Com
pany called by appointment upon Secre
tary Hay to-day and had a long talk with
him touching the prospects of the
Panama Canal Company as affected by
the probable legislation at the approach
ing Congress. The Panama Company has
yet maue no official tender of the prop
erty to the State Department. It nas,
however, given the Isthmian Canal Com
mission, of which Admiral Wajker is
president, a. full "statement of the affairs
of the company and conditions upon
which it might be willing to pass the con
trol of its property to the United Statea
Government in the event that the Panama
route should be chosen. The commission
will Include Mr. Hutin's , report, so that
Congress will, have before it material for
exercising u choice between the Nlca
raguan and the Panama routes. It i3
probable, however, that before the. latter
can be taken under serious consideration a
more definite proposition as to the exact
terms under which the Panama Com
pany's rights could be acquired by the
United States will be required.
The Canal Commission Is making a
strenuous effort .to finish Its preliminary
report, which, according to promise, was
to be delivered to the President to-day.
It Is now said that the document will be
sent to Congress as an accompaniment of
the President's message and that mean
while It will probably not be made pub
lic
It is evidently the intention of the ad
ministration to press canal" legislation
upon " Congress Â¦ earnestly and speedily
from the very beginning of the session.
It is expected that before final action can
be had in the Senate upon the pending
House bill, providing for the construction
of the Nlcaraguan canal, the executive
branch of the Government will have suc
ceeded In removing certain obstacles
which now lie in the course of the pend
ing Hay-Pauncefote treaty and if this
'convention should be ratified the admin
istration's influence will be cast in favor
of the pending bill." There have been sev
eral conferences of late between Secretary.
Hay on one sÂ«ide and Senors Correa and
Calvo, the Ministers for Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, respectively, and it is dfe
lieved that by way of anticipating action
upon the Hay-Pauncefote treaty the bases
have already been laid "for the treaties
with the two Isthmian republics which
would be necessary, to give effect to the
canal bill and to secure for the United
States the exclusive right for the canal
construction. . '

ROMANTIC TALE

OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â In a bjittle with
masked robbers to-night J. T. Crosby, a
boat builder, was knocked senseless, tied
hand and foot and his home in a house
boat on the Alameda side of the estuary
near the California Yacht Club house
ransacked for plunder. The robbers se
cured $9.
The fight was as sensational as a dime
novel tragedy. Crosby was preparing to
retire for the night about 9 o'clock, when
two men waikea out the gangway to the
houseboat and were inside before the oc
cupant had a chance to Â»ay a word.
Crosby jumped to his feet as the Intruders
entered, only to face a tall, darkly clad
roan, whose features were hidden under
Â«i handkerchief that covered his face from
the eyes down. .
The unwelcome caller had a pistol aimed
straight at the boat builder's head and
with an oath ordered Crosby to throw up
his hands. Instead of obeying the com
mand Crosby leaped for the robber, and
with a dextrous sweep knocked the wea
pon out of the masked man's hand. Then
commenced a desperate struggle for the
ri5stol. Crosby was making good head-

It -was on account of what appeared to be
a, coolness between Snow* and Mr. Dow
that I thought the Councilmen were In

house. You see. I had 'an Idea we could
get together and bring about harmony.
Now, Mayor Snow started these meetings
by giving a dinner to the Councilmen.
Then Mr. Taylor followed by inviting
them to his house. Of course, there was
some talk there. I heard something about
removing Chief Ball and appointing Mur
dock, but I was never in favor of Mur
dock. I would rather have gone out of
the city and taken a man.
"I don't know anything about any print
ed list of appointments. All I saw was
Mr. Rowe hand some paper or letter or
something to the Mayor. There was talk
about removing Democrats to make room
for the Republicans. Some of the Coun

of 'to the victor belongs the spoils.' But
I do not remember all that took place at
that meeting. It seems to me that three

Councilman Edwin Meeseâ Without go
ing Into any detail about names of parties
concerned or of times or places, I will say
that there was an effort made to jam
Mayor Snow upon matters of municipal
patronage. For many reasons I was op
posed to anything of that sort and I wouid
not countenance It. In the first, place, h
was new in the affairs of the city's busi
ness, and I had a full conviction that I
v.anted to know for myself before I de
cided to vote for the removal of any ofH
cer or employe of the city whether that
officer or employe was performing his
duty. I should not consent to the re
moval of any man ubon purely political
grounds. This trouble about patronage
was one of the causes, among manyf
others, which led to the unfortunate con
dition of affairs now existing in the mu
nicipal government.
Councilman Anson Barstowâ All my
knowledge on the subject of which Mayor
Snow has. spoken comes to me second
hand. At the time of the Councilmen's
meeting at Mr. Taylor's house I was ab
sent from the city. I have always been
and am now the close friend of Mayor
Snow and have my opinion upon tha sub
ject firmly iixed. In view of the fact that
I did not take part In the proceedings I
am not at liberty, I feel, to say more
than, that my belief is strong that the
Mayor needs no corroboration at my
hands to sustain the position he has
taken. There have been many events dur
ing his administration which confirm me
in my opinions.
Councilman Louis Schafferâ I was one
member of the City Council who was not
invited to take part in those quiet ses
sions of the then solid six or seven whicli
combined to jam the Mayor into handing
over the city's patronage to them. Not
having been present at the meeting which
iras held at Councilman Taylor's rcsi
.lence I cannot s*y of my own knowledge
that anything was, done there. But there
is absolutely no question in my mind that
an attempt was made to jam the Mayor
hard. At the time this matter occurred
I had a talk with the Mayor and when
I learned what was iJie situation I toM
him to go ahead and use his own judg
ment. I believed that he was better able
to discriminate in matters pertaining to
the service of public servants than the
entire Council put together. The members
of the Council who were handling this pat
ronage scheme did not Invite me into
their confidences because they -thought
that they did not need me. But they
would like to have me npw if they could
get me. There is not any doubt that
the trouble about patronage and tlv?
Mayor's refusal to yield led to a com
bination against him In the City Council.
Kverybody knows that is so and tbat
there has been a constant effort to block
any measure which would tend to beneilt

ers of this city was questioned, and I felt
obliged to give the reason why the adoption
of this amendment would benefit the city.
OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â Mayor R. \V.
I Snow, in his fDcech before the
I North Oakland Improvement
Club on Wednesday night, Openly
declared that Â».r.e City Council hail
trifd to Ja:n him upon a question of pat
ronage and that because he would not
make appointments upon demand tried to
prevent legislation of benefit to the city.
The Mayor urged this as one reason why
the proposed amendments to the city
charter should be adopted so that the
Board of Public Works and the Police and
Fire Commissioners should be as far re
moved from the control of the legislative
body as possible.
But It was the charge that the City
Council had tried to control municipal
patronage and had made an effort to force
his hana that set the rolitlcal tongues lo
wagging. The Mayot referred specifical
ly to a meeting at which he declared this
demand was made, and this brought out
some of the unwritten history of the pres
ent city administration.
No municipal administration that whs
ever elected In Oakland started out with
brighter rrospocts and from no adminis
tration was more exacted. The people
were as willing to give- as they were to
receive. All that the administration has
accomplished has been to overcome a de
ficit of $60,000 which they found staring
them in the fare, submit the amendments
'which will be voted rpon on December
S, ard take some preliminary steps, whiÂ«'h
have long been delayed, toward a bor.-i
issue which will not and can not be sub
mitted during the life of this administra
tion. That the present administration ha3
not accomplished anything substantial is
acknowledged by even the members ther'j
of.
Councilman Girard *Â»t a meeting of th-j
Council last Monday night broke forth
with one of his explosive sneeche*. In
which he declared that the people had lost
confidence In the City Council and that lie
had no confidence in the Board of Public
Works.
Mayor Snow follows this up with a pub
lic speech in which he says that the ad
ministration lias been handicapped and
the city injured because he refused to ap
point to office men who were wanted by
members of the City Council. The Mayor
went more into details than did the ex
plosive Councilman, for he stated di
rectly that he had been invited to a cau
cus of the City Council at the residence
of Feltcn Taylor, a member of that body,
and that while there a type-written list
of proposed city employes had been pre
sented to him. The list provided first for
the removal of N. A. Ball as Chief of the
Fire Department and the substitution of
Fred Murdock. The Mayor concluded
his remarks by stating that he had re
fused the request of the Council for these
appointments and that "the attitude of
the legislative body has since been one
of disapproval of this act of the Mayor,
finding expression often in the last eigh
teen months, to the disadvantage of me
city."
The members of the city government
and the politicians of Oakland were
greatly excited to-day over the speech of
the Mayor. The strained relations of the
Retaliataom as ,a
Means of Re- .
vemge.
members of the municipal government
have been the subject of no little com
ment, and when it finally found official
utterance the city became excited.
In regard to his startling speech in
North Oakland on Wednesday night and
the charges contained therein, Mayor R.
W. Snow to-day made the following state
ment:
I had decided not to crltlclie or dlecusr the
charter amendments. They have been deter
mined upon by the City Council, and It must
by this time be evident to the least observant
citizen that Elnce'my election in March of last
year I have avoided every opportunity for dif
ference with the legislative body. The Council
has given cause for offense, it is true. I have
not been blind to that. I regret exceedingly
that the Council should of itself or at the sug-
KWtlon of outglde Influence treat a Mayor's
niiRRPFtinns without reference to their value,
uut rather with reference to the fact that he
has not granted some political request. Â¦ I re-
STPt. as every good citizen must, that so little
has been done by the Council, for the evident
reason that some other is pre
ferred by certain Individuals for this service.
As I fcave said, I had not intended to criticize
r>r discuss the work' of the Council as evi
denced in the proposed charter amendments. But
at the meeting of the North Oakland Improve
ment Club, which the papers have reported, 'the
mand been - less, involving consequences less
serious. than the substitution of experience and
competency for. men lesi competent and less
experienced,, the request would have beÂ«n
granted for the sake of harmony and progress.
Such a situation should never be possible In
any city. Patronage which the chief, executive
has to dispose and the Council he is presumeO
to direct and through which body he must work
for the 'public good if at all. rfhould be as far
removed from each other us the poles. For this
reason, 1 at lensl, I am en advocate of the pro
posed amendment with reference to the Police
and Fire Commissioners.'-:; ;;
But few of the City Counctltnen could be
found to-day. Councllmen Rowe and
Lemmon were sick. Councllmen Upton,
Stetson and Cuvelller were In San Fran
cisco. , Councllmen Mott and Taylor could
not be found. The other members of the
Council, however, made" the following
statements In regard, to the Mayor's
startling speech: ,.*>>i-J.

Dr. Jacob Voorsanger, rabb! of the Con
gregation Emanu-El, spoke on "Priests of
the'Present Dav nnd of the Past." In tha
course of bis address Dr. Voorsanger said:
"I wish' to speak 'this evening about
priests and prophets. Jeremiah was a
great prophet, and because he said what
he thought it was his duty to express he
was unpopular and thrown Into Imprison
ment. It Is Just the same to-day; the av
erage person does not want to hear words
of. "warning or advice from their priest,
and when he tells them they are not ob
serving the laws l3ld down by Goa he is
Immediately voted a bore and a nuisance.
"In the old days the priest had more du
ties to .perforra than tie does now. Be
sides attending to the altar he had to bo
a musician. A priest was rarely called In
unless he w.aÂ» wanted to perform some
ceremony, such ts at a wedding. dÂ«?atn or
birth. A prophet" or priest can be im
mensely popular If he says everything
that pleases the world: but that Is n&t his
duty. When he observes a movement that
is vicious or wrong he must with the in
fluence he bears attempt to stamp it out."
"Religion Is a system by which a man
Is trained to do his duty to himaelf and
his fellow men." said Rabbi Jacob Nieto
at the usual Friday evening service of the
Congregation Sherith Israel. "All re
ligions attempt* to accomplish this. But
do they all succeed? I say no. The world
Is crying far & religion that will make
men love each other and prompt them to
do charitable acts. ; How can you teach
a man about fire and brimstone and ex
pect him to be merciful? The lower re
gion theory Is certainly very much but of
date. Do you want to have a man believe
in and to love a God that makes you trem
ble at the sound of his voice?
- "In our religion we do not serve God
with any hope of reward; we serve and
obey him for nis dear. sake. We do good
for the sake of good; we need not these
pictures of everlasting destruction. What
â¢ I hope and pray for is that some day In
the near future the world shall be at
peace and that we shall all be united in
one sacred brotherhood."

"NO HELL" AGAIN
SAYS RABBI NIETO
LONDON, Nov. 30.â The members of the
Royal Canadian Regiment, who have Just
returned from South Africa, were en
thusiastically received by the people of
Windsor this morning. The soldiers then
proceeded to the castle and were re
viewed by the Queen in the quadrangle.
Her Majesty, addressing the Canadians,
thanked them for the immense services
they had rendered to the empire. The
officers were then presented Individually,
after which the Queen summoned Private
Armstrong of New Brunswick, who lost
a leg during the campaign, but who Joined
in the march on crutches. After the sol
diers had been shown over the 8tate
apartments they were entertained at
luncheon in the Royal Riding School.
Royal Canadian Regiment Greeted by

RECEIVED BY TEfe QUEEN.
Statist will propose that the Government
should begin negotiations with Command
ant Botha and General Dewet to bring the
war to a close. As the Boer warriors
might misunderstand the motive of an
overture from the military authorities, ts
will suggest that the highest civil author
ity In Cape Town should begin the nego
tiations. If not Sir Alfred Mllner, then the
Chief Justice of Cape Colony, or even J.
H. Hofmelster.
This great financial Journal will lead up
to Its proposal by an analysis of the sit
uation In South Africa, and will say:
"We are losing In every way, losing m.
prestige and losing in life. "We are see
ing our South African possessions plunged
Into greater .distress and the opinion is
gaining ground abroad that we are Incap
able of bringing the struggle to a satis
factory termination." Â©
Military Incompetency will be alleged
and the Statist will aver that military
harshness should be. avoided and the
Boers conciliated.
"If men like Botha and Dewet volun
tarily surrender and bind themselves not
to act against us In the future," the
Statist will say. "Is there any good reason
why a promise should not be given not to
send them out of the country? J. C
Robinson suggests that Botha and De
wet should be invited to take seats In the
legislative council that will be estab
lished. The suggestion is worthy of ap
proval. The Boers should not be ex
cluded, even from the beglprring. from
anything which can safely be given
them."

LONDON. Nov. 30.â To-morrow the
WOULD CLOSE THE "WAR.
LONDON. Dee. 1.â There 13 virtually nj
news from South Africa this morning, but
the retirement of Lord Wolseley, the re
turn of Lord Robert3 and the appoint
ment of Lord Kitchener to the suprema
command, occurring ?Â» they\do simulta
neously, are keenly discussed. Despita
some misgivings, hearty. anproval is ger.
erally expressed at Lord Kitchener's ap
pointment. It la felt mat If any one can
clear up matters in South Africa he is tha
man: and it Is readily admitted that thd
task before him. thoush of a different
kind, is almost as difficult as that whica
faced Lord Roberts ten months ago. an<l
is calculated to give the fullest scope ta
all of Kitchener's talents as an organ
izer.
The Morning Post hints broadly that tha
recent demand of Lord Roberts for re
inforcements has not been complied with
and insists that Lord Kitchener's hand*
must not be tied by any lack of men or
horses. It says:
"If reinforcements are withheld or de
layed Lord Kitchener may be paralyzed,
with what consequence. to the empire no
one can foresee. From 30,000 to 50,000 m%*7i
are required."
All the editorials dwell with consider
able emotion on the nation's debt of grat
itude to Lord Roberts, who has "success
fully piloted us through one of the dark
est hours of our history."
From Cape Town cume indications of
the uneasiness felt. All military p03ts
throughout Cape Colony are beÂ«n^
strengthened. Bloemfontein la now pre
pared for any possible attack. Extra
scouts are out and guards watch throusrn
out th*Â» night. The garrisons at the Or
arge River drifts are being Increased. At
the fame time measures are being taken
to assist in the restoration of order and
prosperity. Tbe Pretoria correspondent
of the Daily Mail announces that "tha
British are distributing oats and- seed po
tatoes among; the surrendered Boer farm
era at nominal prices, without which th.9
farms would go untllled for another
year."

The prize was the privilege of attending
any matinee performance in San Fran
cisco. -The Orpheum was selected, and this
afternoon the visitors, accompanied by
two petty officers, will reap the reward
of their attention to drills and duties.
The second section of .the first division
of the apprentice crew of the United
States training ship Pensacola will attend
the Orpheum matinee performance this
afternoon.. Shore leave is a rare thine: at
the Tcrba Buena training station, and this
particular liberty was granted to this di
vision as the_prize for their, excellent
work in the Thanksgiving- day sports.
These sports were directly In line with the
â¢work for which the apprentices are being
trained, and there was not an event in
which the winning section was not first
or second.
Apprentices at the Orpheum.
Leary,* : with a. -number of . other men.
was employed to. dig a ditch across Mar
ket street, close to the car line. The ex
cavation was so close to the track that
the men had to leave their work every
time a car passed. As Mission-street car
No. 1172 hove In sight the men were warn
ed by a lookout, employed for that pur
pose, to get out of the ditch. Leary was
at the extreme end and while in the act of
stepping out of the ditch the front part of
the car caught him and he was dragged
several feet ahead of the car before it
could be brought to a standstill.
Leary has several broken rib*, a badly
bruised shoulder and probably Internal In
juries. '
Several railroad detectives were soon on
the scene and immediately they wanted to
take charge of the case. They suggested
a free ride in a hack to his home at 117
Natoma street and attention by Dr. Gar
diner, the company's physician, should he
desire it. Leary snowed considerable
sameness. He did not want any hack
that he could not pay for. and "besides,
he said, "It might scare the old woman.'
Last night Leary was resting easily, but
he will not be able to resume manual
labor for some time. . ; :â¢
John LÂ«ary, a laborer, employed by the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Light
Company, miraculously escaped being
crushed to death by a south-bound Mis
sion-street electric car at Third and Mar
ket Btreets yesterday afternoon soon after
1 o'clock. Although the man escaped with
his life, hÂ« is severely injured.

Mr. Cannon was asked for an expression
of opinion on the recent political* fight.
"On, I don't know anything. about poll
tics now," he replied. "You see. I have
lost track of It since I left Congress. My
eon Is still quite a politician, though.'"
The son referred to is Joseph G. Cannon
of Illinois, who has for many years rep
resented his State in Congress. In re
gard to the new Salt Lake-Lou Angeles
railroad, which Senator Clark is promot
ing. Mr. Cannon "thought the line was
now assured, although up to a few weeks
a^o he doubted very strongly if the road
would #>ver be r built. :- - .
"I was interested a.t one time In Just
such a road as Clark. 1s going to build,"
said Cannon, "and if It had not been for
the death of my ; eon. Newton, " I think
there would be a road . between Lob An
geles and Salt Lake to-day. My son was
to have managed, the line. .In -fact.-, all
the plans were in his hands. When he
died I didn't feel able to; take hold of
such a big undertaking. alone, so the mat
ter was dropped." â¢
. Cannon was one of ttae first; emigrants
to Salt Uke. He was born In Liverpool,'.
England. At a constitutional convention;
held in Salt Lake City in JS72 he. was
elected a delegate to present the constitu
tion and memorial to Congress â¢ for â¢ th*
admission of Utah Territory Into the;
United States. He was a delegate from
Utah to; the. Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth
Congresses and in the Forty-seventh Con
gress hie election was declared illegal be
cause of his religious -beliefs.
George Q. Cannon; Mormon and former
Congressman, arrived In this city yester
day arternoon from Salt I-ake City. He
Is on his way to Honolulu in search of
rest and a change of climate. Cannon is
a very distinguished looking gentleman,
short . of stature, with almost silvery
white hair and goatee. He begged to* be
excused from an interview at the Palace
last, evening. . saying .that . his trip here
was purely one of pleasure. and rest.

and the car containing the remains, and
a large number of friends accompanied
the remains to their last resting place.
The pallbearers were chosen from ..the
absence of the ceremonials of the high I
