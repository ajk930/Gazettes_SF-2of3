Roosevelt Closes His
Campaign in Old
Kentucky.
COVINGTON. Ky., Oct. 13.-Ad
dressing one of the largest crowds
that ever assembled in this city.
Governor Theodore Roosevelt to
night closed his campaign in Ken
tucky and to-morrow will proceed on_ his
tour of Ohio. Long before the Governor's
.arrival here Courthouse square, in which
the speaker's stand had been erected and
decorated, was congested with men and
women anxious to hear him. Though the
audience was not so enthusiastic as that
which nathered at Lexington or that at
Mount Sterling or at Ashland, or at Mays
vllle, the Governor was given the most
respectful attention and he was inter
rupted frequently by applause or by per
sons who made friendly comments upon
the salient points of his speech. It was
the tenth speech Governor Roosevelt had
made since morning, the first being at
Lexington,, where. W. C. P. Breckinrldge
and Judge Durham, both ex-Confederate
officers, put the crowd in the best of
humor in jointly Indorsing the .Governor.
Then at Winchester and next at Mount
Sterling other large crowds greeted the
arrival of the train, providing parades.
Moorehead, .Ashland, Greenup, South
Portsmouth. Vanceburg and Maysville in
successive order paid tribute to the Gov
ernor's popularity in Keptucky, and the
crowd which gathered at the depot here
betrayed no diminution of the desire to
see him. .
Early in the day Leslie Combs, chair
man of the Republican State Committee,
had received dispatches from Covlngton,
informing him that Republican leaders
were apprehensive that an organized ef
fort would be made to break up to-night's
meeting:. Mr. Combs hurriedly transmit
ted his information to the Governor,
whereat the_ ; latter smiled broadly and as
sured tli#^(S|lrman that there could be
no possiDjaVc/knger of serious interruption
of hisj^ouAin* Kentucky. To insure abso
lute tranqihint$E/and to provide against
any hostility, Chief of Police

ddub)e*d;-llJ*n/ forces. All such precau
tions, howevV^'proved* to be unnecessary,
for beyond isolated instances of good
natured * badinage and the tooting of a
few tin horns,' the meeting was as peace
able as a matinee.
The Governor's speech was brief. After
the speaking Governor Roosevelt was es
corted by the 'First Voters' Club of Cin
cinnati to the Grand Hotel, In that city,
where an informal reception was held and
where he will remain until to-morrow
morning, when .he will enter upon his
itinerary in Ohio. In his 6peech to-night
Governor Roosevelt â¢?said:
"I wish to appeal to you, men of Ken
tucky, In the name of civil liberty. ', I
regard the currency as an important is
sue; I regard our prosperity as an Im
portant .Issue; but* more important than
anything else is the right of every man
to casf his vote as he chooses and to have
it counted as cast. ' We can afford to dif
fer on questions of policy; but we cannot
afford to differ upon the fundamental
rights of American citizenship. (Ap
plause.) : .
"In the State . of Kentucky every *man
is in honor bound to stand up and see that

posed so largely of women, for certainly
In this coijtest the woman Is as much In
terested as the man. Is not the mother

Interested in making life worth something
for her son? I wish that every mother
in this land could study the trust ques
tion and learn her own connection with it.
She finds out about it when she goes to
buy sugar and other articles controlled
by the trusts and is told that the trusts
have raised the prices. But to my mind
that Is the least objection to the trust.
If the trusts raise prices we can simply
buy less, but when a trust monopolizes an
industry and closes the door of oppor
tunity against' the young man -and at
tempts to condemn a man to a permanent
clerkship under monopoly and to servi
tude under- a great monopoly, then mon-
After the outdoor meeting at
town closed Mr. Bryan was escorted to
the epera-housc, where he spoke. Here
Bryan spoke of the importance of the
campaign, saying -that the contest was
not more his than it was that of other
people who were concerned about the wel
fare of the nation at large. He referred
to Ihe presence of so many ladies, and
addressing himself to them, said:
Mn* Bryan spoke twice in Youngstown,
first in the public square and then In the
opera-house. His Experience at the open
air meeting strikingly Illustrated the fu
tility of getting together excessively large
crowds for a political meeting. In the one
important respect of attracting many peo
ple to see the national candidate the meet
ing was an unsurpassed triumph; in the
other respectof giving people -an oppor
tunity to hear him It was a failure, and
tho success one way was the cause of the
failure the other. People had been coming
into the city, from Ohio and Pennsylvania
all day. so that when Mr. Bryan arrived
at 4:20 in the afternoon all the principal
streets were ' crowded and the square
around the speaker's stand, possibly 400
feet on each side, was densely packed
with people struggling to get near the
platform and to secure a glimpse of the
lion of the occasion. There was no effort
to create trouble, but the natural hum of
thousands of voices and the struggle for
place was such as to almost destroy the
effect of the speech. The stand provided
for the accommodation to seat sixty per
sons held 400 standing. The arms of news
paper men on the stand were pinioned so
close that they could n^t raise them to
write and those who were twenty fe*Â»t
away could not hear the speech. Mr.
Bryan himself had scarcely more room
than was necessary for him to stand erect
and a squad of policemen was necessary
', i.teserve the space for him. Tho3e who
were able to hear received the speech
with frequent bursts of applause, and this
was often taken up by others far away
from the range of the speaker's voice, so
that it may be said that the meeting Â»--a.s
enthusiastic even though mest of those
present failed to hear what was said.
"I understand that this is the birthplace
of the President of the United States. Tou
have the honor now of being tho birth
place of the President, whether he holds
one term or two. He cannot be born
again and give you another chance. You
had all you can Have out of it."
* manner to a compar
atively email number o7 people who
had congregated at tha railroad sta
tion. Before entering upon his speech
proper he referred to the fact "that the
place was intimately associated with the
career of his distinguished rival for Presi
dential honors, saying:
that issue is our *
,preeem conditions and the continuation of
them. The full dinner pail is the best ar
gument I know of."
A' voice, "How about the coal mines?"
"The coal mines are all right," said the
Senator.
A voice, "How about the strike?"'
"The strike will be settled this week."
replied Mr. Hanna.
"All wind!" a voice shouted.
"The only things I know of that are a
superfluity of wind are Bryan Demo
crats," rejoined the Senator. "I want to
ask "this audience of worklngmen what
W. J. Bryan has ever done for the work
ing people of this country?"
A voice, "Nothing!"
I "There is not a man here but who
knows that William McKinley has been
the best friend of the working people of
any man this country has ever produced."
At Racine another large crowd greeted
the Republican national chairman, de
manding a sneech, and Senator Hanna
complied in a few word3 covering sub
stantially the same ground as covered in
his speech at the Junction.
Ailis, a suburb, of Milwaukee, was the
noxt stop. Here the train was surrounded
by workingmen from the rolling- mills and
other near-by manufactories. Mr. Hanna
spoke briefly, sayin? it gave him extreme
pleasure and gratification to meet so
many persons. He said he was not con
nected with the speakers' bureau when
he came qut to meet the people face to
face; that he belonged to the executive
department of the Republican National
Committee, and that he wished to tell Re
publicans and Democrats alike that ev
erything was coming out all right, and
that there would be four, yes, ten years
more of prosperity, and appealed to all to
enter the band wagon. He wanted to
show the people on this trip, he said, that
he was not as the papers caricatured him
âwith horns.
The first extended stop of tho day was
made at Waukesha, Wls., where elabo
rate preparations had been made for. the
reception of the Senator. Escorted by a
reception committee, which m*t the spe
cial train at Milwaukee, Senator Hanna
and party on arriving at Waukesha were,
driven through the decorated streets of
the city to the Casino, near one of the
springs. The building was packed to the
doors some time before the party arrived.
The appearance of Senators Hanna and
Frye was the Eigr.al for applause, which
lasted for several moments. Senator
Frye was Introduced and spoke at some
length.
When Senator Hanna was introduced
some one asked if there was anything the
matter with Hanna and the audience
roared that he was all right. Senator
Hanna bowed and waved his ; handker
chief to a crowd of young ladles on tha
si#ge. decorated to represent the different
States of the Union, and when quiet had
been restored spoke in part as follows:
"I consider the Issues and results of this
campaign second in importance to none
since the foundation of our Government,
certainly since the foundation of the Re
publican party. Tconsider it of such Im
portance because It comes down to a pure
business propositionâ a proposition in
which is involved our well being, the com
fort and happiness of our families, the
maintenance of a policy in the adminis
tration of our Government which means
a continuance of this grand development
of this great nation, a continuation of
prosperity which brings happiness to
every fireside and wealth and 'Â¦ greatness
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 15.
There Is no concealment t>y the
authorities of their earnest de
sire that peace negotiations between
the powers and ' China be Instituted at
once. Only such action, the officials be
lieve, can prevent fresh outbreaks which
may further embarrass this Government
In attempting to bring about a nrompt
solution of the entire question Without
affecting the administrative and terri
torial entity of China.
This belief is based on representations
made to the State Department by Minister
Wu and dispatches received by Secretary
Hay from W. W. Rockhill. Special Com
missioner of the United States In China.
Mr. Rockhill has submitted a report show
ing that upon his arrival in Tokio he in
terviewed the outgoing Minister for For
eign Affairs and also Marquis Ito. the new
Premier. He received most satisfactory
assurances from these gentlemen relative
to the policy Japan proposed to pursue.
From Japan Mr. Rockhill went to
Shanghai, where he saw LI Hung Chang,
and then went to Peking. He reported an
interview pome days ago with the Viceroy
cf Shantung. That official^ announced his
willingness to continue tbe policy of sup
pressing the revolt, but he urged that
peace n*goÂ«ations be instituted as rapidly
as possible, as he believed it would be im
possible to prevent an outbreak unless
some step in the direction of official peace
were taken.
Mr. Rockhill has r.ow gone to visit the
Viceroy of Shanshltung. Mr. Rockhill is
doing good work In allaying any suspicion
the Chinese officials may entertain re
specting the policy of the United States,
and is supplying Information to Secretary
Hay of great value.
Secretary Hay has received no confirma
tion of the report that the Emperor and
Empress Dowager have determined to re
turn to Peking. ' Minister Wu is likewise
In Ignorance of any such. purpose. .Mr.
Conger has not reported the alleged con
ference of diplomats in Peking relative to
Germany's suggestions.

of Starvation.
HAZLETON, Pa., Oct. 15.â Want and
ruin have followed In the wake of the
strike In the anthracite region. Families
who lived in comfort while the mines were
in operation now feel the pinch of priva
tion and. the bare necessaries of existence
teem- like luxuries; business men upon
whom prosperity had smiled have been
brought to the verge. of bankruptcy; thriv
ing towns have become stagnant, casual
travelers have forsaken them and news
paper correspondents and labor leaders
constitute the most Important element in
the floating population. Strikers who had
some little money, on hand for an emer
gency have cut their living expenses down
to a minimum, buying nothing but food
and little of that. In many instances they
are ablÂ« to obtain some credit from local
dealers, but the "WIls cannot run very
high.
As thpre was little coal to be hauled the
ccal railroads had to lay off the crews of
most of the coal trains. There are actu
ally In the enormous yards at Mauch
Chunk several hundred coal cars, which
under normal conditions should be scat
tered on railroads from the Atlantic to
the Pacific. In many towns it is now im
possible to obtain coal for domestic use
at any price.
The stagnation of trade here Is, of
course, felt by the manufacturers and
â¢wholesalers of the Eastern cities who fur
nish the Fuyplies, and as the merchants
can obtain no cash from their customers
they must appeal to their creditors for
leniency. Appeals are being made to the
United Mine Workers' organization for
funds for the " relief of the destitute
strikers who can get no credit.
TO INTERCEPT THE MARCHERS.
General Gobin Goes With the State
Troops to Panther Creek Begion.
SHENANDOAH, Pa., Oct. 13.â Advices
have reached General Goblji. in command
of the State troops here, that a large
body of marching strikers have left- Mc-
Adoo for the Panther Creek region. They
expect to reach that valley in time to in
tercept the miners on their way to work
in the morning. General Gobin ordered
Tour companies of the Sixth Regiment to
leave to-night for that valley and a spe
cial train on the Philadelphia and Read
ing Railroad was pro\-ided to take them
to Tamoqua. which station is but a few
miles from Coaldale.
General Gobin went with the troops and
assumed i>ersonal command. The Gover
nor's troop of cavalry, which is stationed
at Oneida. will leave for the Panther
Creek region early In the morning. Gen
eral Gobin. before leaving, said he was
requested by Sheriff Toole to send soldiers

been in ODrraUon at the Reading coller
les. One of the directors of the Reading
company said to-day that he Is opaosc-1
to the new wage scale, and intimated that
he would make an effort to defeat such a
proposition. He Everted that the Eliding
pcale had for years proven satisfactory,
both to the company and employes, as
was evidenced by the fact that until the

George Hartlein. secretary of District No.

"The terms I bolieve will be accepted by

President Mitrhcll declares the strike off
officially. Bis demonstrations will be held

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Oct. 15.â With 1 the
exception of, Bryan day In 1896, when the
crowd and parades far exceeded anything
before known In the city, the demonstra
tion in honor of former Governor David
B. Hill of New York was the greatest
ever known here. The city was lavishly
decorated with bunting and probably
40 000 visitors were here. Two thousand
men marched In the parade of Democratic
clubs. Governor Hill arrived at 1 o'clock
this afternoon and was met at the Wa

proposition because in the great widening

has taken a front rank. Its influence
has spread beyond the borders of our
country and the wealth that Is being

our industry and a tribute to the intellll
trenoe of our people. '
Mr Hanna then denounced Mr. Bryan
for what he termed his "attempt to ar
ray clas? against class," and then took up
the trust question, saying:
"The constitution does not reach them
all or do the laws upon tho statute books
of 'the T'r.ited States. The Sherman act.
passed by a Republican Congress, has
wip^l out all the Irusts that can be
reached under the constitution. And
when 1 pay trusts. I mean the combina
tion? of capital whose Investments are In
the hands of stockholders, but whose
Â«tockhol<i<*rs have no right to vote, the
stoclc being simply voted by the trustees,
ps the Supar Trust was, as the Iron Pipe
Comnany wa.Â«. and c_s the Trans-MiPsourl
Traffic Association was. All of these
wer* wiped out by the Sherman act and
the Supreme Court of the United States."
Mr Hanna then predicted that if in or
der to destroy trusts the protective tariff
was removed, general business disaster
would follow, and concluded a? follows:
"Do we want to Rive notice to the great
army of workingmen in this country .hat.
in deference to theory, to satisfy the cm
bitlons of one man. we are going to de
strov their hopes for the future? It
comes down to that, my friends. That Is
exactly what It means. In the name of
nil th?t Is good and holy: In the name of
men women and children, who have come
to us from foreign shores to better their
condition, let us stand together, main
taining the wages of the American work
lnpmen. continuing to build up these
preat industries, availing ourselves of
these great reservoirs of natural wealth
that God has given u<* and go forward,
brushlnsr from our paths all demagogues
and ambitious men by telling them that
we know our business and are going to
attend to it."
After leaving the Casino Mr. Hanna
was driven to the city park, where he ad
drrpsed a large outdoor meeting, follow
ing the lines of his previous speech.
opoly strikes a severer blow than It does
through the prices that It extorts.
"Mothers, what would you have your
sons do? Would you have your boys go
on to the farm? Why, you know the
farmer takes more chances- than any
other roan and. has less Influence in the
Government; at least he- is less considered
by those who gwÂ«rn. â Are you going to
have your boy go among the laboring men
and have but one ambition, and that to
have a full dinner pall, and only to have
that when the trust will let him have it?
Are you willing to let your son go into
the anthracite coal region and take his
chances at less than a dollar a day, with
powder at $2 75 a keg? ! Are you satisfied
to have your boy go there? Do you want
him to go into a store? Don't you know
that the trust is hemming the storekeeper
about? Don't you know that the trust is
shortening credit? That It Is laying on
the retailer all the chances of business?
Don't you know that the trust to-day is
compelling the merchant to agree not lo
sell any but trust-made goods? Would
you have your boy go into a big factory,
when to-morrow the trust may come and
bankrupt him? Would you have your boy
have stock in a trust that the big stock
holders will freeze out before the year is
ovf-r? What will you have your boy do*
Will you have him become a lawver?
Why. tbf> law business is gravitating
toward the offices of the large corporation
attorneys and the other lawyers are clerks
in their offices. What do you want your
boy to do? Is it not. time that you were
thinking? Is it not time you were using
your own Influence to take this Govern
ment back and place it on its old founda
tion and make it again a free government
of the people, by the people and for the
people, in which the humblest citizen mny
aspire to the highest reward in the politi
cal world? Is it not time that you moth
ers were thinking and if an economic
question cannot arouse you, is It not time
that you were studying the army ques
tion?"
Mr. Bryan then ! took up the questions
pertaining to the increase of the army
and the acquisition of Pacific Ocean terri
tory. The ladles applauded the speech
freely.

EUZABETHTOWN, Ky., Oct. 15.â Perry S.

tee, Cnlcapo: Both statements, are absolute
Mes- without onÂ« particle of foundation of any
sort, character or description. I never said
anything, remotely resembling either. statement
in Chicago or in Cooper Institute or anywhere
else. If responsible people circulated them I
would suggest a suit for criminal libel. I ex
plicitly denied them in my Kansas City speech.
They are slanderous Â¦ lies which would only be
circulated by scoundrels, and which were known
to be lies by the people who Invented them and
the people who circulated them.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT,
there !s no condoning of the offenses of
those who violate the will of the people.
There should be favoritism for none and
discrimination against none. 1 wish on
this point to appeal not only to Repub
licans, not only to Gold Democrats, not
only to those Silver Democrats who from
high, censcientious motives are with us In
this contest, but I want to appeal to the
misguided men who have upheld the other
side in the wrong that they have done,
men who are misled by the shibboleth of a
"We have reached a stage in the cam
paign when our opponents arc engaged in
busily explaining either their actions or
their words. Mr. Jones, the chairman of
the Bryanlte Democracy, has just been
explaining that he is not connected with
trusts becaupe the cotton bale is not a
trust. Of course, using the word in a
technical sense, .there Is no trust In the
country. Tne sugar trust and the Stan
dard Oil trust are not technically trusts
at all. but simply great corporations. So
the cotton bale trust is in the same sense
of the word nut a. trust, but a corporation.
But of course all this is mere quibbling.
Using the word in the. popular sen^e, us
we 1,'Mierally do use it, all these corpora
tions are trusts. It is^sheer hypocrisy to
speak of the steel trust, the sugar trust
and the Standard Oil trust ana then to
deny that the cotton bale trust, the rice
trust and the whisky trust combines are
in the same category.
"On Saturday last in Ohio Mr^ Bryan
tried to defend himself for what he had
said about our iirmy, answering my criti
cisms. He ttrst of all stated that I had
changed my position since .my Detroit
speecn, which simply is not so. I stand
precisely where I stood then, and Mr.
Bryan ?â¢ithcr knows this or ought to know
it. Our regular army Is infinitesimal In
size compared with the population, and
even Mr. Bryan ought not to be afraid of
the eighty-six hundredths of a regular hoI
dier for every 10(w of our people. In the
next place, Mr. Bryan sought refuge in
saying that the army bill had been amend
ed. It is. of course, idle to quibble about
amendments. The present law is what he
was speaking of and what I was speaking,
of. At present we have an army of 100,000
men, C0.000 of whom are regulars, and it
was concerning this army that Mr. Bryan
spoke when he stated that the object of
getting it was to terrorize the laboring
men when they made just demands. It is
impossible to stigmatize too strongly such
a statement. It does not contain a scin
tilla of truth; it has not a particle of
foundation; it can only appeal to thor
oughly base and unworthy passions. The
bill was voted for by the great majority
of the patriotic Democrats of both houses.
."Docs Mr. Bryan mean to imply that
these Dcmocrat8*in so voting, headed by
Senator Cockrell,' were actuated by a pur
pose of putting the army into forts near
the groat cities In order to terrorize
workingmen? What he says applies as
much to the Democrats who voted for tho
bill as to the Republicans; and if such a
statement is slanderous as regards some
of the supporters of the bill it Is also
slanderous as regards the others. The
simple truth is that, as Bryan perfectly
weir knows, every intelligent man fore
saw that there would be trouble in the
Philippines, and that for this reason, as
well as to garrison our seacoast forts,
and for other duties, such as meeting a
contingency like that which arose in
China, the army was provided. When
Mr. Bryan advocated the signing of the
treaty with Spain he advocated the tak
ing of the Philippines, and therefore . re
storing and keeping order In them, and it
he was so blind as not to foresee the
trouble ahead the reflection is upon him
and upon no one else. The onfy thing
that could have avoided trouble in the
Philippines was the policy of scuttleâ the
policy of craven, ignoble and flying and
shirking of duty. To stay there and ea
tablish a stable government as proposed
by Mr. Bryan is a policy which would
cause as much trouble with Agulnaldo's
followers as any others, because they are
fighting simply to found a cruel and op
pressive oligarchy. The only wav to 1 se
cure permanent peace and civil 'and in
dividual liberty for the great bulk of the
Inhabitants of the Philippines was to do
precisely what we have doneâ take them
over as a necessary incident of the war
with Spain and then put down the bodies
of armed bandit^ and introduce a gov
ernment of law, 'order and justice
Mr^? rya ? has S0U S h t In vain to an
swer Vhat I say about the army. But
he does not dare to answer the questions
which I put to him in the same spirit I
answered the ten questions he had asked
and I propounded some for himself. HÂ«
has not answered whether or not he will
pay the interest of the national debt and
the pensions of the volunteers of the
Civil War in gold or silver, if elected. â¢ He
has not answered whether h> will refuse
to receive .the electoral votes of North
Carolina because obtained for him bv a
flagrant violation of the doctrine of "the
consent of the governed, which he so ar
dently champions when he seeks to apply
it to the Tagal bands on the other side of

in consequence of a suspicion that she

amount of Â£1,500,000.
According to the Dally Telegraph's cor

Commenting upon the activity of the

"There are certain indications pointing
to the conclusion that unexpected diffi

suggest that It is impossible yet to denude
South Africa of any substantial portion of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
GEORGETOWN, Ky., Oct. 15.â The
Youtsey trial was resumed to-day, al
though Youtsey was reported in the same
.condition as last week. The door of his
room was opened and his bed pulled up
In plain view of the jury, and while the
witnesses were being- examined Youtsey
could be heard calling his wife's name
In a hollow, moaning voice and she could
be seen sitting on his bed.
The feature of the day was the testi
mony of Arthur Goebel, brother of the
murdered man. He told of going to the
jail the day Youtsey was arrested and
then said:
"I put ray left hand on Mr. Youtsey's
right shoulder and said:
" 'Mr.- Youtsey, Colonel Campbell has
ju.st returned und told me what, you have
said to him, and I have come over to you
to have you tell me what you have told
him. I want you to tell me whether It is
true and to ask you a few other ques
tions.'
"Mr. Youtsey said: 'Yes, Mr. Goebel,
what I have told Colonel Campbell is
true.'
"I then said to Youtsey: 'Now. I would
like to have you tell me about getting the
key on Monday morning from Powers and
about Dick Coombs and -about going to
see Taylor on Tuesday morning and where
you got the cartridges.'
!' Youtsey proceeded and said: 'Just as
I told Colonel Campbell. I had a talk
with Dick Coombs on Monday morning
and he told me he was ready to do the
shooting and I went to Caleb Powers for
the key to his office and he told me to go
to John Powers. I went to John Powers
and John Powers gave me the key. I
went to Governor Taylor and I told Gov
ernor Taylor that Dick Coombs was ready
to do the shooting. Governor. Taylor
said: "You ought not to come to see me
about this. I have been expecting this
to be done for some time, but I object to
having a negro do it. It is too Important
a pleco of work. Coombs may be a spy
and he may betray us."
"Youtsey hesitated and I said: 'Very
well, what did you do next?"
"Youtsey said: 'I left Governor Taylor
and on Tuesday morning I went back to
Governor Taylor. I said to him: "The
man to do the shooting is now here." '
"I interupted Youtsey there and I said:
'You have told Colonel Campbell the
name of that man and that Is one reason
why I came over to see you. Now if you
know that much, you can also give me
the name of the man,' and Mr. Youtsey
said:
" 'Well, I told him Jim Howard was
there; that I thought he got here Mon
day night.'
"I asked: 'What else did Taylor say?'
Youtsey .said: "Governor Taylor walked
up and down the floor and said: 'Yout
sey, what do you think? If Ggebel ia
killed do you think J could hold' my of
fice?'- He discussed that matter, talking
to me back and forth, and I said to him
1 thought if Goebel was put out of the
way the contest would be settled and he
could hold his office. Finally I said to
him, as Governor Taylor hesitated still:
'It is up to you; decide now, whether It Is
to be done or not.' Â¦
"After sqme more hesitating, Youtsey
stated that Taylor finally said: 'Well, tell
them to go ahead. If it Is necessary I
can send the man to the mountains with
a squad of soldiers.' I said: 'Did he say
anything about pardoning him?' and
Youtsey said: 'Yes, that is so.' He said:
'If it is ; necessary I can pardon him and
he will be safe enough.' Youtsey then
Mopped, and I asked: 'What did you do
then? You told Colonel Campbell, as he
told me, that you let certain people into
Powers' office.' Powers said: 'Yes; I then
went back and reported. " I told Berry
Howard and Dick Coombs and Jim How
ard to go and be in the hall of the execu
tive building, and then I left.'
"I said: 'What did you do?' Youtsey
said: 'I went and got the cartridges.' I
said: 'Very well: go on.' Youtsey said:
'When I went back Berry Howard and
Dick Coombs and. Jim Howard were in
the hall and I unlocked the door and let
them In and gave them the cartridges.' I
again interrupted and asked Youtsey to
whom he had given the cartridges. I said:
'That is one question that I wanted to ask
you. Mr. Youtsey,' and he said: 'I gave
them to Jim Howard. He was the last
man who went in the door.' I said: 'How
many did you give him?' and he said: 'I
gave him the whole box.' I said: 'Mr.
Youtsey, who fired the shot?' and he said:
'I cannot tell you; I did not see
him.' I said: What did you do
when you let them '. in?' He said:
'I stayed near the door.' I said: 'You
gave the cartridges to Jim Howard?'
He replied: 'Yes, sir.' Mr. Youtsey then
stopped, and I said to him: 'Mr. Youtsey,
you have just told Colonel Campbell and
told me that Monday morning you went
to Governor Taylor and told him that
Dick Coombs was ready to do the shoot
ing, but Taylor objected, and now you
tell me that on Tuesday morning you let
Dick Coombs into tho office. How la
that?' Youtsey hesitated and then finally
said: 'Well, those were the three men I
let in.' I looked at him arid said: 'They
say also that Berry Howard was in the
left hand lobby of the Legislature, and
you say you let him in that room?' Yout
sey finally said: 'Those are the three men
1 let in there.' "
Wharton Golden testified that, he saw
John I,. Powers give Â¦ Youtsey a key on
Januaiy L"9, and Powers said it was a key
to Caleb Powers' office. .
\V. H. Culton testified that Toutsey told
him of the plan to kill Goebel and escape
through the basement: that Youtsey
asked him to swear after the shootlnf:
that he (Youtsey) was in the legislative
hall when the shot was fired; that Yout
sey told him that Governor Taylor had
been urging him to leave the State and
Culton said he told Taylor about it and
Taylor told Youtsey to deny any such
thing In the future and deny all knowl
edge of the shooting.
Culton was cross-examined to-night and
stood up fairly well under the cross-fire.
Upon the conclusion of. his testimony the
Commonwealth rested its case and court
adjourned till to-morrow morning to give
the defense time to consult as to making
a statement to the jury.

which were not accepted by the injured

EVERY TRAIN
HAS ITS QUOTA
OF DELEGATES
There Is a strong possibility that Julius
Kruttschnitt, at present general manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, will be
appointed president of the big railroad
system as successor to the late C. P.
Huntington. This prospective promotion
of Kruttschnitt is at present the chief
topic of discussion among railroad capi
talists and those interested in transport
ation management.
Quite a number of those who have
grown gray in the service of the South
ern Pacltic and hold lucrative positions in
the big corporation are enthusiastic over
Kruftschnitt's chances, and they have
good substantial arguments to support
their opinions.
In*the first place they claim that H. E.
Huntington. nephew of the deceased mil
lionaire, has repeatedly remarked that
he did not wish the position nor would he
accept the presidency of the road under
any circumstances? With Huntlngton's
refusal to take the place the question
arises, "Who is more entitled to the po
sition than the present manager of the
entire Southern Pacific system?" It is
a rule among all Eastern roads to place
in such a very responsible position of
this kind a man from the operating de
partment, such as Kruttschnitt. and not
an official from the traffic department, of
which John C. Stubbs Is the head.
Kruttschnitt's friends claim he is thor
oughly conversant with the workings- of
the read and has been of invaluable as
sistance to the company since he was ap
pointed to the position he has now held
for the past five years. He is at present
in charge of tluÂ» operating department of
the system and has been the chief oper
atinpfoffleial during the entire absence of
H. E. Huntington.

KRUTTSCHNITTS CHANGES
APPEAR VERY PROMISING
While the result of the survey is very
satisfactory to Americans, it is less so for
the Canadians, for the Kritish Columbia
district of Chilliwaek will lose the trade;
of the mining district to the towns of the
State of Washington. C I>. Lane of San
Francisco and persons in Seattle ami
Whatcom are the principal owners of tho
Lone Star and other large properties. The
Gold Basin mine, however, has been found
to be in a peculiar position. Its tunnel ia
said to be cut in half by the boundary
line, leaving half of the mine, which is
one of the richest in the district, on the
American side and the other portion oil
the Canadian side. Which is the golden
section of the mine Is not reported.
If the survey Is not considered satis
factory to the Canadians, the Astronomei*
Royal at Ottawa will bÂ« asked to make a
more careful Inspection. Again, if hia
survey should not prove correct in the
eyes of the people Interested, a joint com
mission from the two countries may be
asked for.
The survey was exceedingly difficult,
and none of the original mounds 'or
stakes, if they ever did exist, were found.
Nearly twenty miles east of Mount Baker
the survey took up the line, which ran
through a precipitous section of the bis
mountain.
VANCOUVER, Oct. 15.â The Canadian
survey of the disputed international
boundary line at Mount Baker was com
pleted late on Saturday and the officials
employed thereon arrived in Vancouver
to-day. Surveyor Deane says that all the
valuable mines in the best of the mineral
belt are in American territory, but Can

tory, instead of the strip two miles in

BARK MEROM LOST
ON KADIAK ISLAND
Dzittta Asher* With Its Cargo of
&sln:ca During a Gale nnd One
Seamaa Loses His
Life.
SrÂ«r-:Â«: T^t*"--*-. to Th<- Call.
SEATTLJC. Oct. 15.â The bark Merom,
C&ptatia Peterson, was driven on the rocks
c* Kf.Â»i:ak l:0a::a r.car Karluk and totally
wrcie-ke-,* by the northeastern gale which
Kcw â¢Â»-.:>* almost hurricane force through
c;:; :?-.Â« afternoon of October 6. A sailor
kr.cwr. .p.* "Dutch Bill" refused to leave
the ship ar.o \vem down to his death. The
other ~^mV>< > rs of the crew swam to the
fceacJ; sr.! were saved. Her cargo of 12,090
cases of s-alrr.on was lost.
The bark was the property of the
Alaska Packers' Association and news of
the ditafter was brought to this city on
that company s steam tender Kadiak,
which arnvea from Karluk last night.
The fifteen surviving members of the
crew had narrow escapes, several being
badly bruised and cut by being .thrown
against the jas^d rocks while swimming
to the bench. Some clung to the ship and
were hauled to land on a life line.
"Dutch Bill" had apparently been crazed
by the excitement and his companions
were unable to induce him to leave the
ship. A faithful dog remained with him
until the bark went down and then man
aged to reach the beach.
The Merom wAs at anchor in the harbor
when the blow started on the morning of
October C. As the gale increased during
the afternoon her anchors began to drag,
and finally the chains parted. Adrift
in the hurricane, no power on earth could
save her. She was thrown against the
ship Santa Clara, at anchor with 50,000
cases of talmon aboard. The bark pound
ed the ship for a few minutes and was
then torn away and thrown squarely
upon the reef. In an hour she was a total
wreck, and even her timbers were soon
ground to kindling wood.
The Kadiak. which brought the news,
was near the doomed vessel when the
storm arose, but she was at once put to
sea and. suffered no damage. She return
ed after the wreck and picked up the
crew, bringing Steward Simmons, Sea
man Frank Landrrberg and the vessel's
colored boy to Seattle with her.
The Merom was a 1021-ton vessel, built
at Bath. Me., in 1S70. She was owned in
San Francisco. Her dimensions were 173
feet and 37 feet beam. She. sailed from San
Francisco for Karluk on August 2S with a
cargo of COO tons of coal for the company's
canneries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 13.-David S.
Hirschberg remains superintendent of the
Preston Reform School aC lone and it is
probable that he will continue there until
the unpjeasantness growing out of the re
cent scandals has ceased, when; it is ex
pected, he will present his resignation,
and it will be accepted. There was a
mooting of the trustees of the school at
lone on Saturday afternoon, at which
witnesses were examined concerning their
knowledge of the cases of misconduct and
immorality cited in the press. Although
on that same afternoon John Devcreaux,
the day watchman at the school, had been
summarily discharged by Hirschberg be
cause he admitted having answered the
questions of a reporter concerning affairs
nt tho school, those witnesses who were
.summoned before the trusires were as
sured that they need not fear to speak
out fully and boldly, as their positions
would not be jeopardized. Whether or
not they remembered the Devereaux inci
dent, according to their testimony every
thing was going smoothly at the school
and there was no ground for complaint.
The trustees found in favor of Hirsch
berg.
One of Dr. Hirschberg's supporters was
Trustee Dungan of Woodland. Mr. Dun
gan on his return to his home stopped
over in Sacramento and authorized the
Bee to state for him that from all the
testimony adduced at the meeting on Sat
urday afternoon "it was amply demon
strated that there is a woeful lack of dis
cipline at the school, due to the extreme
leniency and good-hearted credulity of Su
perintendent Hirsrhberg."
Mr. Dungan further said that Hirsch
berg in place of being brutal had been
"just the opposite; that he had not suf
ficiently backed up the captains and
guards when they were in the right; that
he had been too tender hearted with the
worst boys when they needed severe dis
cipline, and that the result was that the
institution had no discipline left."
Vindicated by Reform School Trus
tees, but It Is Believed His Res
ignation Soon Will Be
Handed In.'

The San Francisco Jockey Club re
ceived a request from' Carruthers &
Shields to reserve eighteen stalls for the
horses owned by that iirm. The stable
will leave Chicago in about ten days.
Advance Guard, Zoroaster, Topmast,
Precursor and Prejudice are the raou
likely members of the string.
Trainer Tommy Ix>ttridge now occupies
stalls at Oakland tra<:k with a big string
of horses, among the number be
ing 1 the Sacramento Futurity winner,
St. Rica, and the very fast but unfor
tunate Diderot. Tommy also has in his
charge a number of horses owned by A.
B. Spreckels.
Quite recently at Harlem track. Chi
cago, Jockeys Jack Martm and Buchanan
gave an exhibition of rough riding
through the stretch that startled both
judges and spectators alike. Each in
turn tried to put the other over the fence
and the officials, deciding Buchanan to be
the aggressor, -the Cahfornian was given
a lay-off.
Recent reports from the East say Book
maker George Rose handles anywhere
from $40,000 to $50,000 a day and is nearly
$200,u00 winner. Of course, the latter
statement is subject to the pruning pro
cess.
One of the largest winners around the
Chicago tracks is' Pat Shannon, who i3
$70,000 to the good. He may come out
this way and try the booking game.
"Conductor" McManus. it would seem,
did not score a success bucking the' East
ern game. Back pedailng to Chicago, he
bids fair to* recoup his losses.
Rumor has it that Rlley Grannan and
"Willie Appleerate have doubled up as a
team and will book on tne local tracks
the coming season. This is in direct refu
tation of the statement that Rlley had
grown fond of the "vintage" and had
ceased to be a factor on the turf.
Johnny Humphrey and Henry Schwartz
gave $2S00 for the booking privilege at San
Jose and laid away very little coin. The
play was very light, which caused such
a contraction of prices that not a few of
the talent were returned from the Gar
don City C. O. D.
From the present outlook It Is said six
books will cut in at the Los Angeles meet
ing. An attempt was made at Sacra
mento, prior to the recent State Fair, to
freeze out Joe Harlan by the "syndica
fors," and it is said it will be again tried
at the Southern meet. How this can
be accomplished in the face of it being
advertised as an open betting ring Is not
apparent. At any rate, Harlan is going
to make the trip and will take along his
bank roll.

An immigration sc*r.dal of no mean
proportions has cropped out In the Irr.mi-
Vration Bureau at this port, of which
Kart H. North !s the head. In its most
Innocent or least guilty aspect the story
is one of negligence and of a shiftless and
ur.buslr.ess-like method of landing Immi
grantsâmethods so glaringly loose that
the Treasury Department will order an
investigation Into the episode.
Three Japanese -women, by name Sal
Nishida. Sor.o Masuda and RcmaVMiya
grawa, arrived recentlv en the AnWica
Maru. The Immigration Bureau ordered
that they be detained on board pending
an Investigation, it being suspected that
the women were being Imported for im
moral purposes. Yesterday morning
Charles Geffenev and Robert Lyon.s who
represented himself to be a lawyer, went
to the side of the ar.d handed
to Customs Inspector Frank Barry threo
cards, purportlr.tr to have been issued by
the Immigration Bureau, ortlerlnsr the re
ieas? of the Â¦women. These card3. or
passes as they are called, were sierred by
Immigrant Inspector A. H. Geffeney,
Japanese interpreter for the bureau.
Charles Geffeney is his brother and 13
also a Japanese Interpreter, wl.ose sphere
of influence is chiefly in the Police Courts.
Customs Inspector Barry, remembering
the ordÂ«xs to hold the women, called
Customs Inspector TV. J.5 Her.dricks. at
the otfcer end of the gangplank, for ad-
Immigrant Release Cards Issued by Inspector
Geffeney Used by Slave^Dealers.
Â» vice ar.d HerdrJcks went to the telephcr.a
I on the dock ar.-J called up Captairs Schell
; of the Vr.ited States Immisrration Bureau.
! Captain Scheii replied that no order had
! beta Issued from the bureau for the re
1 leaÂ«e cf the wcm;n. A. H. GefTeney ram a
i in while the captain was talking and toot
I the phone. He assured Mr. Hendrlck 1 *
thnt he had not Issued any passes for the
release of the wemen and that he wouM
j g-n down to the dock at once.
"When he reached there Lyons and G*f
i ferey had disappeared. The card3 -were
j shown to hjm and he aimitted that thÂ«?~
had beer written by him. all except tha
name? of the women, which were in .1
i different handwriting-. He explain^
', that he wrote the p:vsÂ«?s. leavtn^ a blartc
! for the r.ame of the immigrant to ba
I afterward filled In by him. and that h->
; must have mislaid the rasses that wer-Â»
j afterward filled in hv some one and pre
! serted to Inspector Barry.
Inspector O*Â»fTerey said to> a reporter
that it wa? his habit to fill out a number
of passes â¢xiih the date and r.ajse of th*
vessel, leaving- the place for the rsajne cf
imni!?rrar.t b!ar;k. to be fille*! /n by him
on the steamer when about to> land th<3
immigrant?. He added that hÂ» did rot
know whether or not Le had mislaid the
three cards that had been, presented, but
he might haj*e dona so.
Captain Schell tnen annotusced that tr*
â¢women had been ordered deported to
Japan, irh'r.ce they came. Jap&neÂ«Â»
women of this class are quit-d ti the

He was only 25 years old and a sea voy

SANTA BARBARA'S TRIAZu
J. B. Hanify & Co.'s New Steam
Schooner Makes Her Maiden Trip.
THE Santa, Fe Company's new
ferry steamer San Pablo had her
trial trip on the bay yesterday,
over the measured mile along the
Marin shore. Â£he made ' thirteen
knots against a four-mile current, equal
to seventeen knots, ar.d nearly sixteen
krfots on the home stretch. Taking
everything into consideration, the San
Pablo is the fastest side-wheel boat on
the bay and her record from Point Rich
mond to the company's dock at the fer
ries is an exceedingly good one. From
slip to slip was made in a little o\'er
twenty-eight minutes ar.d bota builders
and owners were satisned with that
ghowing.
Axnong- those who went out on the San
Pablo were Captain A. H. Payson. nrst
vice president of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley read and president of
the Santa F* Terminal Company: \Y. A.
Bissell. assistant traffic manager of the
Santa Fe system: J. YV. "Walker, superin
tendent of the Santa Fe Terminal Com
pany; Alex Mackie. secretary ar.d treas
urer of the Santa Fe Terminal Company
aad secretary of the San Francisco and
San Joaqain Valley .-oad; Robert WV.t,
director of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley road, and \V. R. Alberger.
chief clerk to Traffic Manager Bissell.
Numerous other employes were along Â£ucd
all had a good time.
Among the guests of the Santa Fe were
Frank H. MacKormack. general agent of
the Rock Island route: R.' P. Rithet of
Welch & Co.; J. O'B. Gann of the Union
Iron Works, and John Forsyth. Mr.
Forsyth was in charge of the engine
room.
Captain John Metcalf. Lloyds* surveyor,
was also there, as Fas H. C. Whiting,
superintendent of the California North
wn-stem road, and Julius Kruttschnilt of
the Southern Pacific. J. B. Stetson of the
North Pacific Coast road was along and
had with him Chief Engineer Denis Gor
man of the Sausalito and Captain O.
Jorgansen to make rotes. The Sausa
lito ferry system wants a new and faster
boat and judging from Mr. Stetson's
notes, a. boat en the lines of the San
Pablo- will be built to run between SSan
Francisco and Sausalito.
Captain Piilsbury of the Mail Company
was in command of the San PaÂ£lo. He
also ran the battleship Wisconsin when
ehe made her run against time. In both
Instances the runs, were more than suc
cessful and as the battleship Wisconsin
ranks as the fastest vessel of her cUis
afloa.t. so can the San Pablo claim the
title of the fastest ferryboat on the bay.
Under ordinary steam she made the run
from Point Richmond to the ferries (dock
to dock) in 2 1 >'- 2 minutes. Pretty good
time on an eight-mile run.
With Captain Piilsbury In the pilot
house was Captain Luciy oi. the tus
Union and Captain Laurltz-.n. The lat
ter mariner was formerly on the Ocean
Wave ajid gains a weli-earned promotion.
He ta-kes command of the San Pablo to
day. J. J. McDonald, chief engineer of
the tug Richmond, took charge of the
San Pabio's engrines as soon as Mr. For
| syth Â¦was through with them.
The San Pa&lo is one of the most mod
ern vessels in the world. On the upper
deck a space is partitioned off and six
I round tables instated ar.d here passen
i gers coming across the bay can eet a
I light meal without going downstairs.
I This will be a blessing to women with
i children. Retiring rooms for women and
; children have aiso teen provided on the
I upper deck and in this respect the San
' Pablo has not a peer on the Pacific Coast.
i Fre<l Harvey, the well-known Santa Fc
caterer, runs the restaurant through his
representative. F. A. Dempsey. Harvey
I has never been on the coast, but if he is
as good an entertainer as his representa
tive he is all right. J. Emmet Hayden
of the Tiburon route is in charge of the
bar.
Xot Blamed for a Collision.
Captains Bolles and Bulger exonerated
from blame the pilots of the steamship
Columbia and the ferry steamer Berke
ley yesterday for the collision which oc
trurred on the bay between them recently.

is that the company neglected to give his

INSURANCE AGAINST WAR
MAY SOON BE A REALITY
COSPER flND HIS DEFENSE.
YESTERDAY we published a report of the de
fense of himself made by E. T. Cosper against
the charges of The Call and of others who are
opposing his election to the office of Superior Judjje
in Kings County. That portion of his defense that
referred to The Call was reported thus: "He com
menced by giving his opinion of The Call and trying
to explain how it was that he voted for Burns for
United States Senator. He said that Bulla was his
man for Senator and he voted for him until Bulla
himself requested him to desist. After leaving Bulla
he went to Scott. At that time, Cosper declared, The
Call began to urge upon the Bulla and Scott men to
vote for The Call's candidate. At first it cajoled, then
it begged and finally The Call began to threaten and
tried to coerce the Representatives to vote for its
man. When he refused to support or have anything
to do with its candidate. Cosper declared. The Cali
threatened to ruin him. How well it was keeping its
word could be seen, he said, in an editorial recently
published by that paper, which was nothing more
than an article written for the purpose of revenge be
cause he refused to vote for The Call's man fo*-
United States Senator."
A defense of that character raises a question of ve
racity from which there can be no shrinking. The
Call denies every essential allegation in it.
Cosper is challenged to name any representative of
The Call who either urged, cajoled or begged him to
vote for "The Call's candidate" for the United States
Senate.
He is challenged -.0 name any supporter of Bulla
or of Scott who was urged by any representative of
The Call to vote for The Call's candidate..
He is challenged to name any member of the Senate
cr of the Assembly who was urged, or begged or even
asked by a representative of The Call to vote for The
Call's candidate.
He is challenged to name The Call's candidate.
He is challenged to give any proof or even seeming
proof to justify any one of his statements upon these
points.
The Bakersfield Echo recently stated that Cosper
voted for Bums "presumably" for the purpose of get
ting Governor Gage to sign a bill in which the peopl?
cf Kings County were interested. We challenge
CoÂ«per to name the bill.
The "bill" is one Â«->f some pertinence to the issue
because it was reported about Sacramento by the
"push" of Burn? and Gage during the Senatorial con
test that Cosper would vote for Burns in considera
tion of an appointment as a member of the Code
Commission. Cosper did vote for Burns at the regu
lar session. He voted for Burns fourteen times.
After the Legislature adjourned, with the Senatorial
deadlock unbroken, the members of the Code Com
mission were appointed by Gage, but Cosper was not
among them. When the Legislature met in extra ses
sion Cosper did not vote for Burns any more.
Why did he change his mind during the time thai
intervened between the regular and the extra session?
Was it because the Code Commission was no longer
a plum tree to be shaken in the Senatorial fight, or
was it because something had happened to that un
named bill?
Co?per has himself raided the issue oi veracity in
this matter, and he must take the consequences of hi-;
action. A man who will lie on the stump in making
his canvass would not hesitate to be a liar on the
bench should he be elected. We do not like to have
a candidate for a judicial office confronted by an issue
which puts his veracity at stake, but Cosper has none
but himself to blame in the matter, and he must either
answer the questions we have challenged him to meet
or he must wear the self-inflicted brand of liar.

GENERAL WALTER TURN
BULL. ANOTHER DEMO
CRATIC McKINLEY MAN.
DEMOCRACY flND THE TRUSTS.
HAVING found that the people were not to b;
deceived by tlfe cry against "imperialism"
Bryan and his followers a "short time ago under
took to shift the contest from that point and accord
ingly they began a vigorous attack against trusts.
The attack, however, did not last long. The Bryan
ites found the Republican position on that issue so
strongly guarded and their own record so weak that
they soon returned to their first tactics and raised
once more the cry that "imperialism is paramount."
The public is familiar with the story of the New
York ice trust, and is aware of Tammany's relation
to the trust and of Bryan's relation to Tammany.
That, however, is only one of a host of combinations
that bind Democracy to the trusts. Some Democrats
are, of course, sincerely opposed to such aggregations
of capital, but the leaders of the party are too cloÂ«c!y
bound up with the magnates of the most unscrupulous
of trusts to make anything like an earnest fight agains;
them. In fact, the movement of Bryan to make an
anti-trust fight of the campaign was checked on the
publication by the Republican National Committee
of this plain statement:
"Every line of legislation now on the statute books
of the United States directed against trusts and un
lawful trade combinations was placed there by the
Republicans.
"That there is not more stringent law against them
is the fault of the Democratic party.
"The last occasion on which the parties, as repre
sented in Congress, went on record on the trust ques
tion was on June i, iooo.
"On that day a final vote was taken on a constitu
tional amendment to grant Congress power to "defin-*,
regulate, prohibit and dissolve trusts, monopolies and
combinations, whether existing in the form of corpo
rations or otherwise.
"It requires a two-thirds vote of Congress to submit
a constitutional amendment to the State Legislatures
for ratification.
"The question to so submit it was lost by a vote of
154 ayes to 132 noes.
"Of the ayes 149 were Republican and only five were
Democrats.
"Richardson. Lentz, Sulzer, Ruppert. Salmon and
nil the other professional "trust killers" voted no.
They declined to give Congress the power to grapple
with the trusts. The Democrats indulged in spasms
of virtue for two days, denouncing the trusts, and
then voted to continue them.
"In one of Mr. Bryan's recent speeches he gave the
Republican remedy as the final one he would adopt,
in case he was elected and all other means failed.
"In other words, Mr. Bryan admits the value of the
Republican idea, but wants to try other measures first.
He has not said what those measures are to be.
"Some trusts operate all over the country; others,
like the New York ice trust, operate in a single city.
The requisite power to reach each and all and bring
them within the Federal law was denied by a margin
of 36 votes, all Democratic.
"Denouncing is one thing. Doing is another. Mr.
Bryan's trust denunciations, in view of his party's
records, promise no better than the prophecies he
made four years ago; and as a prophet Mr. Bryan has
not succeeded."
In this connection it is worth while to note that not
only is the strongest supporter of Bryanism in the
East. Mr. Croker, a patron and a partner of trusts,
but Senator Jones, the chairman of his National Com
mittee and his foremost supporter in the South, is
also a patron and a partner of trusts, being a member
of the "Round Bale" trust that is now cinching the
cotton-growers. Thus the record of the representa
tives of the Democratic party in Congress and the
record of its leaders in the campaign are such as to
compel Bryan to crawl away from the trust issue. In
Â¦?. fight upon that question his armor would be full of
blow holes and his guns loaded with back-action cart
ridges.
DOCTRINES OF BRYAN MEET WITH
DISAPPROVAL OF GENERAL TURNBULL
Well-Known Democrat Will Therefore Cast
His Vote for McKinley and Roosevelt.
EDITOR San Francisco Call: I
will vote for McKinley and Roose
velt. Heretofore I have voted tha
Democratic ticket at all national
elections In which I have taken
part. While I am not a politician. I have
an interest in the Government as a plain
husiness man. It is true that I voted for
Bryan four years ago. That was against
my better Judgment, but I had voted for
George B. McClellan and for the other
Presidential candidates successively
nominated by the Democratic party an-1
I Have always been a Democrat. But I
cannot vote for Bryan again. He la not
my kind of a Democrat. Four years
ago, I think. Bryan was in earnest, cr
thought he was. in. his free silver 16-to-l
proposition. Eut now that issue h'aa vir
tually been turned down by h.m and the
cry of "imperialism" is brought to the
front. This Is a sham, pure and simple,
but he is working it for all it is worth.
Destiny has pointed the way and Presi
dent McKinley Is doing the best th;>t
can be done to add to the clory. honor
and prosperity of this land, without en
tangling us. in any way. with foreign na
tions: without doing anything tending to
subvert our present ideals of govern
ment. No one wishes us to surrender
the present republic. What .we have
dxine in Cuba and what will be done In
Porto Rico and the Phllipiilr.es has no
relation to real imperialism.
The United States has been placed in
the front rank of nations by the policy uf
the present administrat'on and we lead
the world in all things substantial by
reason of that policy. I do not think
that the American people ought to take
any chance of making a change of ad
ministration at this time. President Mc-
Kinley has sound business judgment and
diplomatic skill and knowledge.
It may be recollected that, during tho
Cleveland campaign of 18S4, I took part,
with ex-LJeutenant Governor James A.
Johnson, in the management of the old
Alta, which we bought and chanped from
a Republican to a Democratic paper. In
all his campaigns Cleveland had my suiÂ»
port and he Is, In my opinion, with the
possible exception of William C. Whitney,
the strongest Democrat in the United
States to-day. It is surprising that the
Democrats have not been able to find any
lender other than Bryan in the past four
years. I do not approve of the doctrines
of Bryan and cannot vote for him on that
account.

UTTERANCE
vid talk about consent of the governed is the shallow
est of hypocrisy.
Last spring Oregon voted on omnibus amendments
to the State constitution. They were on municipal in
debtedness, the judiciary, irrigation, repealing the
negro clause, and woman suffrage. They were all
voted down, as has been every amendment to Ore
gon's constitution when submitted to the people.
The negro clause, inoperate and obsolete, went with
the rest.
Yet Colonel Bryan finds himself entirely capable of
representing that old pro-slavery clause as operative
and vital and supported by the Republicans of Ore
gon as the Democrats of South Carolina support the
nullifying clauses of their constitution.
Colonel Bryan has taken his own measure. None
can make it smaller.
COLONEL BRYAN has begun to realize that all
his highflown talk about self-government is
made ridiculous by the fact that his Southern
supporters have deprived the negro of self-govern
ment, though to do so they have nullified the fifteenth
amendment to the Federal constitution. Nullification
is no new, thing with them. They tried it in 1832, and
compelled Jackson to threaten to hang Calhoun "as
high as Haitian, by the Eternal."
Bryan has been questioned frequently about this
new phase of nullification, which makes his profes
sions as hollow as the sounding brass and the tink
ling cymbal.
During his speech in the*Chicago University he was
asked. "How about North Carolina?" and answered,
"Oh. you have the race question in Ohio, here, and
in Xew York." . .
Out in Kansas he was again asked. "How about
North Carolina?" His answer was, "A Republican
Congress took the ballot away from the negroes of the
District of Columbia."
Again in Dakota to the same question he re
sponded: "Yoif ought to read the treaty with the
Sultan of Sulu, which recognizes slavery there."
Xow none of these answers was true. They were
evasive, and some of them were falsehoods. The race
question is in the North and South alike, and in the
same form. Its manifestation in both sections is in
denying to the negro the right of legal punishment
for crime, while admitting that right to the white
man for the same crimes.
In the South this phase of the race question is en
tirely distinct from denial to the negro, of his con
stitutional political rights. The fifteenth amendment
makes the negro a voter; it gives to his franchise
I exactly the same origin and protection as the white
ninn's franchise. But in North Carolina and through
out the South he is not permitted to vote at ' all.
Where lie is not excluded from the polls by the threat
of murder he is denied the ballot by State law. either
fundamental or statute. As for the District of Colum
bia, it was given a Territorial form of government by
Congress. General Chipman. now of California, was
its first and only delegate in Congress. All men in
the District, of legal age and qualification, voted,
white and black. The constitution gives Congress
supreme control of the District. This experiment of
abdicating that control to a Territorial government
did not prove beneficial, and the act was repealed.
That repeal took the ballot from white and black
alike. It treated the two races with absolute equal
ity. Therefore Colonel Bryan, by these two answers,
did not answer the question. He not only evaded it.
but he told an untruth in his evasion.
As for the Sulu treaty, it is not a treaty in a con
stitutional sense. It is an agreement made between
the Sultan and his Datos on one side and Gene r a!
Bates on the other. No matflcr what its terms, it
does not take from any one rights given to him by
the constitution in the same sense as that instrument
gives the franchise to the Southern negro. Further,
Colonel Bryan knows that when that agreement was
submitted to President McKinley he wrote upon it
his refusal to ratify, for the United States, that part
referring to polygamy and slavery.
These three answers by Colonel Bryan, wholly
evasive and partly flat falsehood, did not close the is
sue. He knew this well or he would have adhered
to the first answer as sufficient, if the question were
risked him again. That he in turn dropped each an
swer for a new one proves his knowledge that each
was false and insufficient.
During his Indiana tour he was asked the question
a fourth time. While speaking at Marion a listcnei
to his talk on self-government asked again: "How ,
about North Carolina?" Recognizing the insuffi
ciency of cither of his former answers, and their
insufficiency even when combined, he took an entirely
new tack. He responded: "My friend, I am glad
you asked me that. Now I am going to assume that
that Republican who asked me the question is an hon
est man. I am going to ask him about the consti
tution of the Republican State of Oregon. I will read
a provision of that constitution. It says: 'Section
35 â No free negro or mulatto, not residing in this
State at the time of the adoption of this constitution,
shall come to reside or be within this State, hold any
real estate or make any contracts, or maintain any
such therein, and the Legislative Assembly shall pro
vide by penal laws for the removal of all such ne
groes by public officers, and for their effectual exclu
sion from the State, and for the punishment of per
sons who shall bring them into the State, or employ
or harbor them.' That was adopted before the Civil
War. It makes it unlawful for a free negro to go
into the State, and it authorizes the officers to put
him out. But. you say, that is old. Let me remind
you that last June a:i effort was made to repeal that
portion of the constitution, and the effort to repeal
was defeated, although the State went iu.000 Repub
lican."
This is a full revelation of Colonel Bryan's dishon
esty and untruthfulness. The Oregon constitution
was made when the State was Democratic. It re
flected the pro-slavery sentiments of Lane, Nesmith
and Delazan Smith, who dominated the politics of
that State. It was similar to constitutional and code
provisions of many of the Northern States in the
slavery period. Iowa had her "black code." A simi
lar code in Illinois was framed by John A.- Logan.
The constitution of Indiana was almost exactly the
same as that of Oregon in its exclusion of free ne
groes.
But Mr. Bryan knows perfectly well that the four
teenth and fifteenth amendments to the Federal con
stitution completely i.ullincd ?.ll such provisions in
the codes and constitutions of the States. They fell
dead at the feet of the Federal constitution, and were
as blank as if the page on which they were inscribed
were so much white paper. They all went glimmering
with the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court,
which did not have # to be reversed, for it was de
stroyed by the Federal constitution. Such provisions I
did not have to be repealed by the States. They we-e
void. Indiana did not take them out of her consti
tution until 1881. The "black codes" of Iowa and Il
linois were, we believe, never repealed. Indeed they
could not be repealed, for repeal implies" that a statute
is in force and can be devitalized only by re
peal. They were simply omitted from subsequent
codification of the State laws. Yet Colonel Bryan
wished, his ignorant supporters to understand, and
they did understand, that this constitutional exclu
sion of negroes from Oregon is in force, that they are
forbidden entry to that State by penal statutes and
that the Republicans of Oregon refused to repeal the
living constitutional provision which he quoted!
This is capable of but one characterization. The
statement is a lie, and he knew it to be a lie. We re
gret that this must be said of a Presidential candidate
of any party, but Colonel Bryan's conduct in the mai
ter admits of no other characterization.
These four evasions of an answer on the North
Carolina nullification prove that he has no answer.
They prove that denial of self-government in the
South is incapable of defense and that Bryan's fer-

It Was When He Was an Army Cap-
tain Stationed at Vancouver, Or.
The Washington County archives con
tain a partial history of a case wherein
suit was brought against a nan who aft
erward became President of the United
States. The case was fi!ed years ago.
when Oregon was yet a Territory and
when the defendant was an ofacer at
Vancouver barracks, then known as Co
lumbia barracks.
This was away back in 1S54. when nearly
all the supplies for the Vancouver post
were purchased at San Francisco and
when no transcontinental roads or tele
graph lines bound the West to civiliza
tion: when no telegram of to-morrow
could tell the department at Washington
that an officer of the United State* army
Â¦was to-day derelict In his duty. The de
tails of the story which led up to the case
cannot be learned, but the trouble grew
out of a draft on Captain U. S. Grant,
who bore the rank of captain ar.d assist
ant quartermaster. The draft was for
Jl^.H), and was signed by a lieutenant at
San Francisco, and reads as follows:
$1200.
San Francisco. July 30. 1S33.â At three
days' sight, please pay to Adams & Co..
cr crder. twelve hundred dollars, and
charge the same to my account.â Georgo
H. Derby. Lieutenant Corps Engineers.
To Captain 17. S. Gran:. A. A. Q. M., Co
lumbia Barracks, Oregon.
The draft waa accepted by Grant on the
12th day of August, 1S53. and a year later
It had not been paid. Adams & Co..
through their agent. Justin Steinburger.
then commenced suit against him in th3
District Court. They filed a bond in a
sum equal to the face of the dra^, and,
being unable to get a summons served on
the defendant owing to his being a resi
dent of another territory, the case went
by default and a Judgment was granted.
Richard E. Wiley was then the Sheriff
of Washington County, ar.d he watched
his opportunity to catch the young cap
tain on the Oregon side. After several
trips, he happened to be in Portland onÂ©
day when Captain Grant came in on a
boat, bringing with him his horse. Sheriff
Wiley attached the animal as soon as the
captain landed. As soon as Grant recov
ered from his surprise, he asked Wiley
to go with him to Adams* & Co.'a agent,
where he thought he could arrange things
satisfactorily. Arriving. Grant paid a
part of the Judgment in cash and gave
r.is note for the balance, thus securinc
his release. The ease was overlooked by
the papers of that day, and has- never
before been made public.
Richard Everett Wiley, the Sheriff
who served the process, was a pioneer of
1845. emigrating from OJiin. ITpon arriv
ing in Oregon he set up the plant cf tho

FRED S. KNIGHT
WEDS MRS. PARKER
The will of the late Emll B. Rosenbaum
will not bo contested nor will his estate
be dragged through the probate court to
the music of an opposition more or less
bitter from his near relatives. It was at
first believed that this decision was due
to the fact that the brother, A. M. Rosen
baum, was willing to let bygones be by
gones and the wishes of his dead brother
stand, but last night he denied any
knowledge of the matter, leaving the in
ference either that his attorney, Sidney
Ehrman. acted without his consent, or
that the concession had been wrung from
him much to his own dissatisfaction.
Since the will of Emlle B. Rosenbaum
was filed there has been a contest follow
ing It, but the only active contestant has
teen Alfred M. Rosenbaumn of this city.
The two other brothers, Charles and Sam.
are in Europe and the two sisters, Mrs.
Isaac and Mrs. Slg Strassberg. have never
supported the proceeding, so Alfred
Rosenbaum was left to make the fight
practically alone. There was no hint of
compromise or dismissal and both sides
were preparing for the trial of the con
test, which was sent for to-day, when Mr.
Lhrman called upon Vogelsang & Brown,
attorneys for Mrs. Sarah Hosenbaum,
widow of deceased, to whom all his estate
was left, and announced that the contest
would be dismissed. No reason was given,
the only explanation being that Mr.
Rosenbaum wished to dismiss his contest,
and the dismissal was filed In the after
noon.
Various reasons for the sudden change
of tront on the part of the contestant
have been advanced by those interested in
the case, but no one is willing to sÂ»y ho
knows Just what the matter is. It is
probable, however, that business interests
compelled the action. The brothers were
In a partnership and upon the death of
Emile it became necessary to settle up
the partnership. Should the contest be
carried on It would only delay the mat
ter, and should the contest prove success
ful the settlement would have to be made
anyway. And if it proved unsuccessful
the dltficultles of a settlement would be
come further complicated. It is probably
that reason therefore that has forced the
dismissal.
The contest was never very popular
anyway, and the difficulty of proving that
"Ducksie" Rosenbaum was of unsound
mind at the time of his death became
more apparent as the time for the trial
drew near. The dead brother left his wife
about J300.000, and each of the living
brothers and sisters had much more than
that to live upon. To break the will
meant little to them and much .to the
widow. So the contest has been dis
missed and the estate will be quietly put
through probate and distributed as
"Ducksie" Rosenbaum directed.

Four bunko men â R. G. Evans,
alias "Chippy"; Frank Lester. F.
M. Morgan and "Little Nels" John
sonâwere arrested yesterday morn
ing in a doorway at Taylor and
Eddy streets by Detectives Ryan
and Crockett and locked up in the
tanks. They are suspected of hav
ing bunkoed two strangers. Octo
ber 4 William R. Mann of Bakers
field was taken to McGlynn's sa
loon. Mason and Eddy streets, and
Induced to part with $10 and a
check for $50. Payment of the
check was stopped. A few days
later John Kramer of Angels
Camp was taken to a room at 423
Eddy street and was relieved of
$47 50. Mann and Kramer had a
look at the four men at the prison
yesterday afternoon, but could not
positively Identify them.
Evans was taken to, San Rafael
In the afternoon, where he . 13
wanted on a charge of gcand lar
ceny. The complaining witness
against him is Joe Escallier. a
saloon-keeper at Ross station. It
is alleged that on the night of
August 16 Evans and two other
men called at the saloon and
bunkoed Escallier out of J1S0. Ed
ward Williams, another bunko man,
was arrested on the same charge,
but the case was dismissed. Evans
alkges that he gave *45 to an offi
cial in San Rafael to "sqvare" the
case.
Lester, Morgan and Johnson Â¦will
be kept In the tanks and shown
the officers of the different watches.
They will probably be released if
they promise to leava the city.

Representatives of the Sutter-street
road called on the Attorney General yes
terday and handed over a check for the
sum named. The legal tender was imme
diately sent to the Treasurer and will be
added to the State's bank account.
An appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court and the case was argued at iensth
and submitted. The court handed down
an opinion affirming the trial Judge's de
cision. It then devolved upon the railroad
company to pay its fine, but when General
Warfleld demanded Interest on the sum
It was denied him. Counsel for the cor
poration took an appeal and the Supreme
court decided that the tine was in the na
ture of a criminal one and was not a
juderment that bears Interest.
The sum was not paid without a strug
gle. For the past year the cn.se had been
in the lower and Supreme courts and the
best legal talent was employed on both
sides. The railroad was punished through
the efforts of General Warfleld of the
California Hotel. He tired of seeing the
unused tracks of the Gutter-street rail
road on bush street and asked leave of
the Attorney General to bring quo war
ranto proceedings against the road in the
name of the State. Permission being
granted a suit was riled and the Attorney
General and Messrs. Freeman and Bates
appeared In behalf of General Warfield.
Napthaly, Freidenrich & Ackerman de
fended the railroad corporation. The lower
court found that the Sutter-street railroad
had been guilty of usurping the franchise
and imposed a lire of $5(XH) on the corpora
tion.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford yester
day turned over to the State Treasurer
the sum of $5000, which was paid into his
office by the Sutter-street Railroad Com
pany in settlement of a line Imposed by
the Superior Court for usurping a fran
chise.

TIRET I*. FORD. Attorney General.
I have not considered the legal effect of a
noncompllance with the provisions of section
2 of the act of 1SS3 above referred to. and ex
presÂ»ly withhold the expression of any opinion
thereon. Very truly yours,
Nor does there appear to be any necessity
for thÂ« printing in full upon the ballots of
proposed constitutional amendment*. Under
the provisions of section 1194. Political Code, a
copy of every proposed amendment Is mailed
to each voter at least ten days before election
thus irlvlng to such voter full and complete
Information in respect to such amendments.
When he comes to vote, nowever. the require
ments of the law would Sfem to be satisfied
with any reasonable method whereby such
amendments could be appropriately Identified
and distinguished, "by number or otherwise,"
so that "each can be voted on separately" in
the manner set forth in section IMS of the
Political Code.
The view here expressed is also in harmony
with that portion of the constitutional pro
vision last above referred to reading ns fol
lows: "Should more amendments than one be
submitted at the same election they shall be
so prepared and distinguished by numbers or
otherwise, that each can be voted on Â«>ep
arately."
"But it does not follow from this that the
language of the Instrument must be under
stood literally. The fame rules of construc
tion must be applied, to ascertain what its
requirements are, as though It were not man
datory and prohibitory. And we think, when
an act commanded or authorized may be done
in different ways, either of which 'would be
strfct compliance with the terms of the in
strument understood In some common and
popular sense, either mode may be pursued,
unless come reason Is discoverable for holding
that one of such modes only will answer.
If. for Instance, the direction to enter the
amendment in the Journal Is compiled with, in
some usual and popular sense of the language,
either by copying the amendment into the
Journal or by placlne upon the Journal an
identifying reference only, either will do un
less the context shows a different intention."
This view Is strengthened by the language
of the Supreme Court of. this State In Oak
land Paving Company v$. Tompktns. 72 Cal..
&, in discussing the proper construction to be
placed upon the words "shall be enteied" in
section 1 of article XVIII of our State con
stitution. Says the court:
Keeping this rule in view we note that the
word "printed." a.Â« used in section 1197. was
not new to the amendment of 1.S99, and that
It was clearly the purpose of the Leglslatuift,
by that amendment, to do no more than to
add "constitutional amendments" to the "ques
tions" that were to be answered by "Yes" or
"No." But this would not necessarily imply
the "printing" of such amendments in fuil.
Rather would it imply a printed Interrogatory
which could be answered by "Yes" or "No, '
according- as the voter desired to vote for or
ajrainst the proposed amendment. The word
"print." according to the lexicographers, may
mean "to record." "to describe." "to charac
terize," etc.. and such must have been the
fens* In which it was employed by the Legis
lature In section 1197 of the Political Code.
The same Legislature that amended section
1197 of the Political Code so that it should in
clude the printing of proposed constitutional
amendments upon the ballot proposed seven
constitutional amendments. the printing of
which In full upon the ballots is practically
impossible and certainly Imi-osslble without tht
welling of the ballot to absurd and imprac-
Jcable proportions. It is scarcely conceivable
that the LeglMature could have intended any
Â»uch results, and. under well known rules of
statutory construction we axe not at llbert>
to *o construe a statute as to render It im
practicable or absurd where It may be reason
ably construed alnn& rational lines.
In my opinion the act of 1SS3 (except as
modified by subsequent legislation) is still in
fore*, though People vs. Curry has left this
somewhat In doubt, but, inasmuch as you
state that its provisions have not t*Â»en fol
lowed we will omit it from our considerations.
\ou then ask if. under the provisions of that
section, proposed constitutional amendments
must be printed in full upon the ballot.
You also refer to the act of 1SS3 (Statutes.
1S83. p. 53). which provides that "each amend
ment must be voted upon separately from the
others, In the manner and form designated
by the Governor," and which would seem lo
oc a complete unsw^r to your infjulrv.
You further say. however: "Aisumln/c the
act of 1SS3 to be in force, the Governor in hU
proclamation has not indicated, as heretofore,
any abbreviated form in which the same shall
be printed upon the ticket, ro that, assuming
he had such a right, he has not exercised it."
In your communication of October 6, 1300,
you quote from section 1197, Political Code, as
follows: "Whenever any question or consti
tutional amendment is to be submitted to the
vote of the people there shall be printed an
other column or columns, with \oting squares,
at the risht of the last or blank column in
which such question or constitutional amend
ment shall be printed, and opposite such ques
tion or constitutional amendment to be voted
on. In separate lines, the words 'Yes' or "No"
*hall be printed."
In 1SS3 the Legislature passed an act
referred to In his opinion, the first sec
tion ot which provides for the publication
of constitutional amendments in the news
papers. Ihis section also provides that
tach amendment shall be voted on sep
arately in the- mariner and form set forth
, b: !L tne Governor in his proclamation. In
1>99. nowever, the Legislature changed the
method of publishing constitutional
amendments. To obviate publishing them
in the newspapers it was directed that
copies be printed in the State Printing
Otnce and mailed by the Secretary of
State to the various County Clerks and
by them sent to the individual voters of
their resjr ctive counties. The Legisla
ture tried to repeal the old act of 1SS3. but
did not succeed, and it is still in force.
The Governor did not designate any
manner or form in which the constitu
tional amendments should be printed on
the baJlots. so that manv County Clerks
were left In doubt as to how they should
be printed. The following opinion in an
swer to a query put to the Attorney Gen
eral by District Attorney Rives points out
the true course:
An opinion which will be of great Inter
est to the County Clerks and voters of
this State wtis forwarded yesterday by
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford to James
c. Rives. District Attorney of Los An
geles County. It is in relation to the con
stitutional amendments which are to be
voted on at the coming election and en
lightens the county officials as to their
duty in printing the same on the ballots.

TCETV YORK. Or-t. 15. â There was an outburst
of large and buoyant speculation j n the stock
xr.arket. which lifted prlct-s during the course of
the day irom 1 to over S joints. The buying
ctnie Irom many filvertent elements, but the
patent fact was tha.t an enormous number of
clocks were bougtt In an eager and confident
manner on a rapid!/ rifing scale of prices.
Forced covering by a largely extended short In
terest had something to do with the rise. Bull
BianipulatiGn by a number of powerful cliques,
come of them newly formed this morning, aided
the advance. The commission houses reported
tbat they had large orders to buy from out
t.10.9 source*. "What proportion tbese various
elements tad In the aggregate O f the day's
trading It is cot possible even to estimate,
Lut no merely technical conditions could have
resulted In bo considerable a rise In prices In
ruch a widely distributed etrer.pth. The true
basis of the advance evidently was the change
In thÂ« money outlook and the promise held
out to the speculative spirit In the general
conditions. There has been steady growth of
confider.ee In Wall street for some time past
In the ceneral outlook for business. It has
titen. firmly held that as Â«oon as election un
certainties were dlEpoeed of there would be a
renewal cf business activity up to the high
level of the recent prosperous period. On the
other hand, the growing construction of the
Â¦money eupply left room for doubt whether the
Intervening period could be safely bridged
Â¦without eueh a money stringency as would be
eieaftrous to speculative commitments. The
conviction was crystallized to-day that the dan
eer of money stringency was mitlgfcted and the
expected post election demand for securities
vas discounted on a very large scale. Satur
day's bank statement demonstrated that a very
large contraction cf loans had been effected
Â¦without serious harm to the stock market, thus
conserving the surplus reserve. The gold en
raged In Europe leet week Is expected to ar
rive In tide to show In next Saturday's bank
statement. The Bank of France's announce
ment through the Associated Press of a deter
mination to export to avert a money strin
gency, and the expressed readiness of the Sec
retary of the Treasury to act toward the same
â¢nd. fcjLd a notable effect In strengthening con
f.dence. The large additional engagements of
sold announced this morning promised further
help to the local market, although the receipt
is deferred -for several weeks. This Is due to
the fact that the pold comes from South Africa.
Th* fact waÂ» much dwelt on In speculative cir
cle* cb marking the resumption of the output
from the TnuisvaAl mines, but the exact source
cl the eupplr and the channels through which
It Is to com* were ehrouded In mystery.
The expected settlement of tho coal strike
yet* also a lactcr In the unvarying strength In
the m&rket and thÂ« epecial strength in the
group of coalers. Realizing in stocks which
had their extreme advance early In the day
ir.ade the closing elightly Irregular, but prices
generally were well maintained at the top.
There was a. decided growth of activity In
bor.de and some notable advances In prices, but
ther* were weaJc epots which made the market
Irrerular. Total sulÂ«e, f 1.960,000.

graw weaker as the session progressed. Liqui

been manufactured for the purpose It could
have done but little more in the way of giv
ing satisfaction to the bears and -discourage
ment to the ho!dÂ«rs. December opened at
75'ic to 74?ic. held for a while over 74*ic and
then, on the visible Increase of 1.077,000 bush

desired by a crop mover and receipts were
liberal.

later. December closed unchanged at 21%C.

Third â The last investigation was Just such
an Investigation as has, been held heretofore ai>
a matter of course and which had been de
nounced by the- President of this board and the
Democratic party as being perfunctory and use
less. Unless we take time we cannot hold a
better one this year. â¢
Fourth-rWe see .at the present time the local
water company In Oakland fighting the rate6
established by the City Council on the ground
that there has been no sufficient Investigation
by the Counclimen. Do the Supervisors desire
to allow the Spring Valley Water Company
such an advantage in case they shall fight the
ordinance we shall finally pass in- February?
Fifthâ The Democratic platform declares "it
is notorious that . the stock and bonds of the
Spring Valley Company had been Issued In ex
cess of the actual money invested; that.prop
erty la belt} upoa which the public pays rates
Anticipating that the Hve-mlnute rule will be
invoked against my addressing the board I de
elro to read the following reasons for referring
the Investigation Into the real value of the
Spring Valley Water Company's property to
the Public Utilities Committee.
FlrBtâ Tbe beard is pledged In the words of
the Democratic platform "to Institute a search
ing Investigation of .the operating expenses and
Into the real value of the water corawiny'i
property used for the water supply of this city,
and to allow not more than 5 per cent on the
stock representing such real value thus deter
mined."
Second â The first investigation held by - this
board was not "searching." It was all in
favor of the water company. Supervisor Tobin
said to me at the conclusion of tbe last inves
tigation that he recognized that iwÂ« had : pre
sented no evidence in our f avox. | It was all in
favor of tbe rate askel tor by the gyring Val-
REED'S statement, explaining his reasons for placing the lm-esUgation of the value of the Spring Valley "Water
Company's system Into the hands of the Public Utilities Committee, which he read yesterday during the heated
debate, in" which Mayor Phelan was a star performer, contains some interesting data, regarding the status of the
water question. The Supervisor characterizes the last inquiry made by the present board as useless and perfunc
tory and he demonstrates why a satlsfa ctory investigation is impossible by the full board. The statement follows:
that In nowise is used In supplying the city and
county with water, and that lands had been
acculred tn exclude possible competition; and
if these Items be eliminated the public will
gain substantial relief."
Is it possible that the members of this board
think they can prove this portion of the plat
form true In ten or a doien meetings of the
full Board of Supenlsors. when It Is a moral
certainty that the time will be fully consumed
by/ thÂ« eloquence of members on" points of
order?
Sixthâ A minute Investigation Is necessary.
For Instance. It will be essential to appraise
every Diece of land held by the. company in
order' to decide if it -is actually used for the
supplying of water to the city or merely held
aa a speculation for the future.. Can the full
board investigate this work? Take the single
case Â¦ of IJaks i Merced. "A large i>art - of Â¦ the
watershed is not used by the company. How
THE STATEMENT THAT CAUSED ALL THE ROW
the Investigation. Why does he 6o th!s? Why
do the Supervisors fellow his !ead? After the
Supervisors had resolved to meet as a coir.ir.it
tee of the whole to investigate water rates
the Mayor directs the clerk to Inform the mem
bers that no meeting will be held. What au
thority has the Mayor to thus adjaum a meet
ing of the board? The work of the Public
I'lllitle* Committee will harm no one and it
might help the c'.ty. I: might red^m the
party's pledges. But no, the same perfunctory
Investigation that has characterized former
Hoards of Supervisors Is again tÂ» take place.
I wish tr> recall to the boar-1 the fact that
wh'n the last water rate was declared the Su
pervisors admitted that no practical investiga
tion had been maJe â that the platform, of the
Democratic party had not been kÂ»pt â but it
was said that during the year a proper investi
gation should be ma-Ie and money appropriated
for the purpose.
At that time it was pointed put that thÂ«
al!egred reduction was a pure "fake." ilr.
Schussler testified that the revenues of the
company had Increased 3 per cent beyond what
had been anticipated at the time the rates
had been fixed by the preceding Board of Su
pervisors, and that he anticipated more than a
5 per cent increase for the coming year, daa
to new consumption of water.
We made a 10 per cent cut on the house
holders* rates established by the last board,
vrhlch Is almost exactly 7*4 per cer.t of the net
Income of the company. It3 gross Income
will be 19 per cent larger this year than wxs
anticipated at the time the old board passed
the ordinance fixing the water rates, according
to Mr. Schussler. Hence there has been an,
actual Increase of 2H per cent of the revenues
of the company. If we could make a T^i per
cent cut in the revenues of the company every
two years, -while its gross income Increased at
the rate of 10 per cent every two years, the
lecomt of the company would Increase at the
rate of S^i per cent until the end of time. This
is why I say that the alleged reduction made
by this board was a "fake." It the schedule
was prepared Intelligently it was a betrayal of
the people. If It was not done knowingly It
only shows how necessary It is to have a tlior
ovgh and "searching" investigation.
Gentlemen, our pledges have not been kept.
This question Js the parting of tho ways, as
It always Is in the Board of Supervisors. Shall
we have an investigation, or shall toe people
learn to distrust this board aa they nave aU
tbe boards la tbe part?
much of the valuation of the rancho should be
excluded, and what shall be placed on what is
left? This wilt take a day's time at least In
actual Inspection of the premises. Will the
full board devote this time to> the matter?
Seventhâ A thorough lnvestijation Into the
real value of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany's property Is necessary in order P> make
a r>rot>er recommendation as to the wlvlom of
bnrlES the Srrlnjt Valley Water Company, or
of bringing a supply of water from the Sierras.
If our engineers report that It will cost 123,-
Ono.TttO to brlnjr a given quantity of water from
LaUe Tahoe or from the Tuolumne or Stanls
lauc rivers, how can we decide to recommend
the adoption of such a plan unless we know th*
actual value cf the Spring: Valley Water Com
pany's property? The Spring Valley Water
Company's property is unquestionably the nat
ural s-.iDPly of San Francisco, because of its
proximity to the. city. What sense Is there In
appropriating $30,000 for the use of the Public
Utilities Committee in examining available
water tupplles, If the Investigation of the near
est and most available Is to be taken away
from it? This Is an investigation into the value
of the Serin* Valley Water Company's prop
erty and Â¦will assist a water committee In ar
rivlrs at a just water -schedule. It is in no
seaie usurping the functions of that commit
tee.
Eighth â It appears that there fs a determined,
and so far successful, effort being made under
the leadership of the Mayor to prevent any
adequate investigation Into the water com
pany's affairs. This will necessarily block the
observance of the pledge made by the Super
visors to the people at the time of their nomi
nation. A pledge has been given to the people
to make a searching investigation. That work
was assigned to a committee consisting of Mr.
Jennings. Mr. Hotallng. Mr. McCarthy. Mr.
Connor. Mr. Dwyer and myself. It was en
larged especially to tajte up this investigation.
Ite members have been carefully preparing
themselves for months to quality themselves to
discharge tbe duties cast upon them by the
board.
There la no question made of the ability of
the committee and no other committee has
taken or desires to take any step in the mat
ter. AH of the acts and recommendations of
the Public Utilities Committee have been
unanimously approved by the 'Board of Super
visors. At this Juncture the Mayor returns

WOULD MAKE SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE COMPULSORY
The Board of Kducatlon distributed
yesterday the new act which is to be in
troduced at the next session of the Legis
lature regarding the compulsory educa
tion of children.
The proposed act has received the in
dorsement of the State Educational Com
mission and of the County Superintend
ents. While stringent In its demands, it
Is not as severe as an act of the same
character which is in force in many East
ern States. Among other reasonable pro
visions is one permitting the non-attend
ance of pupils whose parents can prove
their Inability to support them.
Section 1 calls for at least five months*
attendance cn the part of each child.
Section 2 provide* that any parent or
guardian not compelling their children to
attend school shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and subiect to a fine not
mere than $10, or five days' Imprisonment,
or both. And for each subsequent of
fense a fine of not less than $10 or more
than Jort shall be imposed, or imprison
ment of from five to twenty-five days.
RESIDENTS OF STJNSET
DISTRICT ABE PLEASED
Property Owners Satisfied With Their
Treatment at the Hands of
Officials.
The property owners of Sunset district
are gTeatly pleased with the improve
ments that have been made in their dis
trict of late. The pathway and tunnel
leading to the new music stand In Golden
Gate Park is a source of much satisfac
tion to the residents of th^ district. The
Nineteenth avenue entrance has been
greatly improved by the planting of
grass, which acts &s a preventive to tho
drifting of sand. "Water and gas mains
have been laid as far west as the Nine
teenth avenue boulevard, greatly enhanc
ing the value of the property in the dis
trict. The property facing on Nineteenth
avenue boulevard and Twentieth avenue,
is to be sold In subdivisions by a real es
tate firm that has done a great deal for
the district. It Is expected that the
School Board will soon make use of the
property on the east side of the avenue,
between I and J streets, and erect there
on a schoolhouse for the children of the
district. --
At the request of the property owners
it was recently ordered by the Board of
Supervisors that twelve hydrants be
placed in the district under the super
vision of Chief Sullivan. For protection
against fire all that would be necessary,
once the hydrants are placed, would be
the addition of a number of new fire
alarm boxes and the erection of a build-
Ing for a fire company, which is greatly
needed in the district.
The residents of Sunset district are ably
represented by an executive committee,
composed of the following: Edward
Ewald, Louis Lipman. C. G. Larsen,
Richard Keller and Charles W. Pope.
The scathing arraignment by Supervi
sor Reed of Mayor Phelan and his cohorts
in the board for their dilatory tactics in
connection with the water-rate investiga
tion provoked considerable acrimonious
discussion and bitter debate at yester
day's meeting of the Supervisors. In the
course of a severe denunciation of the
high-handed action of his Honor In hav
ing arranged a postponement of the in
vestigation with a coterie of City Fathers
who are In open sympathy with his policy
Reed gave expression to several disagree
able truths, which was resented by Phe
lan. The latter, forgetting. In the heat of
argument, that he is the city's chief ex
ecutive, and. losing his temper, as he has
done several times in the past, said
things which can only cause him vain re
gret.
Phelan passed the lie to Reed and ac
cused him of being in a conspiracy with
the newspapers to impugn his motives
and those of the board by ascribing to
them an unwillingness to reduce water
rates to be charged the people of San
Francisco.
Rted did not mince words with Mayor
Phelan, who seemed to have left his offi
cial dignity at norne or some other place.
The tilt was lively while it lasted, and
when hostilities came to an end for the
time being it was found that the Super
visors were evenly divided on the point at
issue.
The vote was on a resolution intro
duced by Reed, who felt that he had been
slighted", when the preliminary Investiga
tion into- the value of the Spring Valley
Water Company was taken away from
the Committee on Public Utilities, of
which he Is chairman. The resolution
provided for the recommittment of the
investigation to his committee, which he
claimed to have been deprived of the
work at the Mayor's behest. It was as
follows:
Whereas, On the 10th day of July. 1900. the
Board of Supervisors formally directed the
Committee on Public Utilities to begin an In
vestigation into the real value of the Spring
Valley Water Company's property, whlcn Â»h
vÂ«?fctiÂ»ration was s'JbÂ»pqu*-ntly delayed upon the
ground that the work should be taken ud by
the entire Board of Sui.>er\ lsor?. and Thurs
day. th<? lUh day of October, was set as the
time for beginnlriK the Investigation by the said
board; and whereas, at the fiaid time only two
Supervisors were present, and It is now appar
ent that no "tearching investigation of the
operating expense*" and Into the real value of
the water company's property used for the
supj.ly cf this city" can be had by a full board
because of the impossibility of getting a full
board to meet as often as the exigencies of
such an Investigation will require, now. there
fore, be it
Resolved. That the matter of the Investiga
tion of thÂ» real value of the Spring Valley
Water Company's property used In supplying
the city with water be. re-referred to the Com
mittee on Public Utilities, which shall have the
use of the services of the stenographic reporter
of this board, and the clerk is directed to issue
the necessary pubpenas for persons and papers
at the direction of the said committee.
The "Water Committee had reported that
it was decided at its meeting on October
11. 1WÂ». to meet on Friday. December 7,
1900, to begin the investigation and to
meet thereafter until the investigation
is completed. Chairman Connor of the
committee explained that the Spring Val
ley Company had filed an inventory of all
its property, except real estate, and City
Engineer Grunsky was now placing valu
ations thereon. Reed objected to the
delay and Connor said in rather an ex
cited manner: " â¢:
"I desire to set myself right before the
people as certain strictures on my at
titude have appeared in public print. I
think that in December we will arrive at
a conclusion as to the valuation of the
plant which will be satisfactory to every
one and be an equitable solution of the
question."
Supervisor McCarthy stated that he
still believed that the Utilities Committee
was better able to carry on the investi
gation than the full board. He said that
the chairman of the Committee on Public
Utilities is more competent to direct the
Investigation than any member of the
board.
Supervisor Comte quoted a court deci
sion that a committee investigation with
out the concurrence of the board was
void.
"That committee." said Comte. "has ar
rogated to itself a jurisdiction that does
not belong to it. The law requires that
the Hoard of Supervisors shall Inquire
Into and fix the water rates. If the com
mittee should carry on the investigation
and the board made no inquiry on its own
account the Spring Valley Water Com
oanv could have the order vacated."
McCarthy could see no difference be
tween delegating the power to the com
mittee of the whole and to the Committee
on Public Utilities. To a question by
Dwyer the Mayor said the purport of
Reed's resolution was to fix water rates,
but Reed replied that It was only intend
ed to ascertain the real value of the
Spring Valley plant. After the resolu
tion was read again Mayor Phelan said
that no matter what the language of the
resolution was its ultimate purpose was
to fix the water rates.
"The chairman of the committee will
not disavow it." said his Honor.
"I will certainly disavow any evasion of
the party platform which met with the
approval of the president of this board
and Its members." retorted Reed. "The
matter of fixing water rates is subsidiary
to ascertaining values. The water-rate
Investigation last February was a perfect
farce. Our Inexperience was only too ap
parent. This resolution will permit your
committee to go ahead and preserve the
integrity of the administration and make
an Investigation in line with the acquisi
tion of public utilities, the most important
of wheh is water. The Mayor of the mu
nicipality has no right to obstruct or de
lay this investigation. This committee
has the confidence of the board, which
was shown by an appropriation of $30,000
for the Investigation of water systems."
Connor then directed attention to a
resolution passed recently directing the
Board of Public Works to carry on water
Investigations.
"I will stand with you." said Connor,
excitedly addressing Reed. "We have re
duced rates to the extent of $154,000 to the
people of' this city, and I am willing to
go further."
Reed said that by reason of increased
consumption the revenue of the Spring
Valley Company had Increased 5 per cent
over what was estimated by the board.
"We can go on cutting its "revenue down
5 per cent," said Reed, "and it will get
more than 5 per cent in return by reason
of larger consumption and increase of
subscribers. We can plead ignorance of
the situation when we tixed the rates, but
I say if it was done knowingly it was un
adulterated fraud."
"Come to order. Sit down; you are out
of order." interrupted the Mayor, rapping:
loudly with his gavel.
"I am not out of order any more than
you have been when you made numerous
addresses to this board without its per
mission and against its rules." retorted
Reed. Thereupon his Honor felt himself
called upon to say something in defense
of himself and the members, who he
claimed had been traduced by their col-
league, which he did in the following lan
guage:
"'ihe gentleman's course in this matter
is the result of a conspiracy with the
press and others to discredit this adminis
tration, and provoke a scene. He pro
ceeds cn the assumption that I am op
posed to reduced water rates, whereas for
the last three years I have been battling
for them. The reflections on this board
and myself are calculated to create a
false public impression, and I nail them
as lies ordinarily are nailed. The board
at the last meeting voted a lack of con
fidence in the Utilities Committee by
transferring the investigation back to the
board. The whole trouble can only be
ascribed to jealousy on the part of some
members with a view to getting some
newspaper notoriety."
Supervisor Brandenstein resented the
accusation of jealousy.
"1 supported the resolution to transfer
from the committee," he declared, "not
for reasons of jealousy, the change of
which is so absurd that It needs no an
swer, but because it is a violation of the
charter to delegate the power to a com
mittee."
Tobin said something about being
pleased that there were some gentlemen
on the board, and. that the members were
not all politicians who desired to have
their names exploited in the newspapers.
Reed asked lor the privilege of reply
ing to the Mayor's aspersions, which he
did in the following language:
"I have too great a regard for the dig
nity of the Mayor of San Francisco to use
any derogatory or unparliamentary lan
guage concerning him. I desire to* with
draw any such unparliamentary language,
leaving that to the president of this
board."
At this juncture Comtc jumped into thi
fray saying: .
"The gentleman is out of order. I will
not stand here and listen to such unpar
liamentary language, which belongs to
the Police Court. No Supervisor should
be permitted to make such remarks on
this floor."
"There is no jealousy on my part," Reed
continued calmly: "I welcome the assist
ance of every member in this important
matter and I regret the withdrawal of
some Supervisors. It Is notorious that la
February we did not do our duty. 1 deny
the Mayor's assertion that a vote of lack
of confidence in the committee was passed
by the simple act of taking away from it
the investigation. The chairman has been
personally assured by members of that
confidence on many occasions. As to the
newspaper notoriety I welcome ihe as
sistance of the press in accomplishing any
reform in the interest of the people. It
has no power to injure a good man who
has the confidence of the people, but it
can destroy any man who has forsaken
his pledges and lost the support of the
public."
Then quoting from the Mayor's mem
orabie speech at a recent banquet Reel
said:
"I Â«lo not regard, as others do, the press
as 'Insignificant, impotent and important
only in libel.'
"What have we done during our term
of office?" continued Reed. "Have we
paved any streets or built any buildings?
We have done nothing to Justify our ex
istence. The Public Utilities Committee
proposes to make a detailed, thorough
and searching investigation into the water
question. Let us stand by our party plat
form and pledges and regain the confi
dence of the people which we have lost.
This can be done only by acting together
without jealousy or selfishness."
The resolution transferring the Investi
gation back to the committee was lost by
a tie vote as follows:
CS _r3ooth. P.oxton, D'Ancona, Ho
taling. Jennings. McCarthy and Reed.
Xoesâ Brandensteln. Braunhart. Coxntc,
Connor. Curtis. Dwyer and Tobin.
Reed won a partial victory, however,
when the resolution postponing the in
vestigation until December 7 was recon
sidered. Brandenstein urged immedia'e
action and moved an amendment that the
board t*>gin the Investigation next Fri
day at S o'clock p. m., which prevailed
by the following vote:
Ayesâ Booth. Boxton. Brandenstein.
Curtis. D'Ancona. Dwyer. Jennings, Mc-
Carthy, Reed and Tobin.
Noesâ Braunhart. Comte. Connor.
The officials of the water company will
be subpenaed to attend the investigation.

I or the utmost Importance to the weltare and
i prosperity cf San Francisco: and whereas, it
; eppears that there will be at the disposal of
'. this board a sum of money estimated at tSSO.-
I V.'i cn account of an unexpected increase in the
I assessment roll after the budget was made up.
Â¦ which said sura will be available at latest by
! the 1st of July. 1301. Now. therefore, be it
: Resolved. That It is the intention of this
I B-ard of Super\'isÂ»rs to appropriate not less
i than |UMt0M of said sum of money ti,r the pur
â¢pese of re paving accepted streets In the busi
ness portions of the city, and in particular in
removing cobblestone pavements therefrom.
and the IVkuM of IÂ»ublic Works is directed
forthwith to make a report to this board of
th" streets in the business portions of the city
Ftandiriir meet in need of repavins. with the
kind of pavements best adapted to the said
streets and the estimated cost of the proposed
improvements.
The City Attorney filed an opinion on
the Question of the availability of the ex
cess revenue m which he holds that li.
cannot be expended by the board during
the present fiscal year, but will be at Lh.3
disposal of the board during the next
fiscal year for municipal betterments.
The opinion, which is quite interesting,
directs attention to a defect in the char
ter, which does not provide for such an
emergency and is in part as follows:
It would appear to be possible to conduct the
city government under the present assessment
for less than the 11 tax rate nxed as a maxi
mum by the charter. The rate of this fiscal
year, which is within the charter limit, prom
ises an excels of revenue. Thib may be used
next year and the tax rate reduced, or if the
same rate be retained an equally large surplus
would be realized, which would also be avail
able for permanent Improvements under proper
appropriation. If the surplus this year -will
amount to a quarter of a million dollars that of
next year should be a like amount, and taken
together a fund of half a million would be
at the disr>osal of the board during the next
fiscal year for municipal betterments.
Surh surplus revenue is at this time specu
lative. It would be i-osslble perhaps for the
Board of Supervisors to so lessen the income
of the city as to leave no surplus. Moreover,
it is not at this time possible to foretell how
great a proportion of th* year's assessment
will be held invalid ly the courts. In short,
until the end of the fiscal year arrives no one
can know: w:tb positiveness what surplus, if
ar.y. there will be in the treasury. And If It
were now attempted to make a new and sup
plemental appropriation as to the estimated
Furplu* Fuch appropriation might be the cause
of a deficit in the budget appropriations here
tofore regularly made.
I have looked In vain throughout the charter
for the suggestion that theBiard of Supervis
ors had power to deal with any public funds
except as provided by budget appropriations
and demands thereon. If the Supervisors should
Indicate their desire as to the manner In which
tbia rurplus should be expended still the ques
tion Would remain, how could the money be
drawn from the treasury? The charter ex
preÂ«sly provide* that no money can be drawn
from the treasury except in accordance with
an appropriation, which appropriation must
have been made in the budget.
The Merchants' Association filed a pe
tition requesting that if the City Attor
ney shall determine that the $200,000 to be
received as excess revenue through an in
crease In the assessment roll is available
a sufficient amount be devoted to the
repavement of public streets in accord
ance with recommendations heretofore
presented by the association. The petition
recites:
On March 53 last, in sccordanoe with the re
quest of the honorable Board of Public Works,
the Merchants' A>fociation submitted certain
recommendations for the repavement of the
public streets. In our communication of that
date we recommended that a systematic plan
cf reiiaving be adopted which would ref-ult In
the removal of the cobbles and the repavlng
of the worst streets in the business district
within four years and that J125.000 be appro
priated and expended each year during the next
lour fiscal years in the pcrformarice of this
work.
Accompanying this communication, we rub
mittcd a schedule of the streets to be repaved
during the present fiscal year and schedules
for the repavemeni to be done during the suc
ceeding three years.
Ae only about $35,000 was appropriated for
repavlng the business streets during the pres
ent year, it has rot been possible as yet to exe
cute our plan for general repavement. Since
the budget for this year's tax levy has been
|Tejiar*d an additional amount of $200.<"QO has
come into the treasury through an Increase
the assessment roll. Whether this amount will
be available during this nscal year is a ques
tion that wÂ« understand has been submitted to
the City Attorney. In casÂ« It shall he held
that this fund la available during this fiscal
year we would now respectfully recommend
and urse that at least a sufficient amount be
devoted to the repavement of the public
streets in accordance with thÂ« recommendations
heretofore presented by this association.
The Committee on Public Buildings
recommended that the Supervisors reduce
the estimate of $3500 made by the Board
of Public Works on the cost of the pho
tograph gallery in the Hall of Justice to
$3150, and a resolution to that effect was
passed to print.
Supervisor McCarthy In a report on the
question had characterized the estimate
as being too high. He stated that he had
procured a private estimate from a com
petent authority who said that the work
could be done tor J2523. The report states
that the contract for the steel framo
work of the gallery was let after com
petitive bidding, but not in the mannc;
provided by the charter. The committee
[finds that the inference of Superintendent
Barnctt that Supervisor McCarthy was,
hy reason of being secretary of the San
Francisco 'Fire Proofing Company, Inter
ested in the proposal of M. Collins, an
unsuccessful bidder for the work men
tioned. is not In any manner supported by
facts, as Collins was In no way represent

Water Pours in by Rudder-Chain
Ports, but Quick Work Prevents
Serious Disaster to
Steamer.
OAKLAND, Oct. 13.â There is a
"hoodoo" on the Southern Pa
cific transfer boat Thoroughfare.
At an early hour this morning
she repeated her performance of
several weeks ago and sank at the Pe
ralta-street freight slip. The accident this
time was luckily not so serious as the for
mer one and the company was saved tne
inconvenience or again laying off the big
boat for several weeks.
While a run of coal-laden cars was be
ing transferred to the steamer the heavy
load caused the vessel to settle rapidly in
the water. Her deadlight ports were all
closed during the loading process, as the
result of the recent disastrous experience,
but the ndder chain ports at the stern
were below thewater line by reason of the
load and before the burden could be easeo
the steamer had settled sufficiently to
start. a rush of water into her hold.
The* trouble was discovered in time to
give the crew and freight train men time
to haul the cars from the deck of thÂ«
boat to the dock, but in the rush there
was a ripping and tearing of tracks
which caused considerable damage.
The speed with which the boat was re
lieved of the heavilv freighted cars
saved her f/om serious trouble. Six hours
of pumping emptied her hold, ar.d after
being given temporary attention the ves
sel was put Into commission again.

The Board cf Supervisors took deter
i^ined action yesterday to compel the
Market-street Kailway Company to take
up a'.l Its abandoned rails and ur.used
tracks. A resolution on the subject was
introduced by Reed and adopted as fol
lows;

Beeolv<-<*, That all such wurk. must be ccm
pSrtti before the 1st oC January, U01, mm there
:e no \iM reason for any delay m the doing
<.; raca work by the company.
Eraunhart war.ted the resolution re
ferred to the Ju-iiciary Committee with
Instructions to add a clause which will
compel the company to take up the tracks.
Reea objected, saying that it the com
pany does not obey the provisions of the
resolution by January 1, 1901. it was the
purpose of the Utilities Committee to in
troduce another resolution compelling the
performance of the work. He said the
company had already commenced to take
up tracks. At this point Braunhart inter
rupted Reed and asked to be allowed to
speak. Reed would not give his consent
and Braunhart said testily:
"I thank you for the courtesy."
"Courtesy is something that never
troubled you privately or publicly," re
plied Reed, giving Eraunhart a hard look.
This tally was but a precursor of the
warm debate over the water rate investi
gation which came later in the meeting.
Curtis' resolution was also adopted and
directs thf- Market-street Railway Com
pany to remove all unused tracks, poles
and other obstructions on Market street,
from Second to Sutter; on Broderick, from
McAllister to Oak; from the crossing of
Stockton street, thence along Pacific t?
Montgomery avenue and on Washington
street, from Kearny to Stockton, and on
Stockton street, from the crossing of
"Washington, ther.ce northerly twenty feet
bryond the crossing of Pacitic street. The
resolution requires the company to re
store the roadways of the streets named
to a uniform condition, the same to be
done to the satisfaction of the Board of
V'jfc^ic Works and the whole expense to
be paid by the Market-street Company.
A resolution was pa^ed to print grant
ing to the Presidio and Ferries Railway
Company permission to set back tempo
rarily four feet the Fouth curb of Union
street, between Hyde and Larkin, and to
pave the strip with basalt blocks. The
company, however, must, upon the recon
struction of Its roadbed, cable alley-way
and car tracks of its cable system in the
center of the street v.i:hin four years,
restore the sidewalk on the south side of
the block named to its original condition.
The company must give a sufficient bond
in the rant at (20,000 that it will carry out
the conditions. McCarthy's amendment
that the company be required to pledge
Itself not to at i for an extension of time
lo reconstruct its system was defeated.
A resolution was presented by Chairman
Reed of the Public Utilities Committee ac
oeptiag the offer of a right or option to
purchase the franchise heretofore granted
to the People's Mutual Telephone Com
panv. It authorizes the payment of $1 to
close the contract. The resolution was re
ferred to the City Attorney to determine
what effect fr.ter'jr.g into such a contract
would have upon the city. *â¢

Judge Hall to-day settled the- trouble i
of the Plummer family by granting a di
vorce to Waiter Plummer from Mary B.
Plummer on the ground of desertion. Uc
der an agreement that Mrs. Plummer
should have the custody of the minor
child, Phyllis, and receive HD a month
alimony, she withdrew her cress-com
plaint. The only witness was J. C. Bates.
Mrs. Plummer' s father.
Plummer had charged his wife with de
sertion, claiming that about a year and a
half ago she went East on a visit. On
her return to Alameda she failed to so to
the home of her husband, but Instead
went to live with her father. Mrs. Plum
mer's actions caused a stir In Alameda
society, and for a time the gossips of
the Encinal City were in deep clover.
According to Plummer. he paid a num
ber of visits to hJs wife at the home of
her parents in an effort to induce her t>
return to him. but was ignored. Finally
he was curtly notified by mail that Thurs
day was her day at home. This was more
than he could bear and the divorce suit
was the result.
Mrs. Plummer immediately filed a cross
complaint, charging her husbar.d with
cruelty. The specific acts of cruelty werÂ»
that he always found fault with her
cookinff and absolutely refused to eat
stew prepared by her. Fancy dishes set
before him she alleged her husband term
ed "nasty stuff." and, turning up Ms
nose, shoved them aside.
Plummer i3 interested In the Crystal
Salt Works. He pleaded poverty in court
this morning and said his income was but
$50 a month.

Within a Weekâ Major Reagan
Suffers a Relapse.
This is the day of the army mule at
the Presidio. Within the last week five
men have b^en severely injured by the
animals. Yesterday John Gal way, a pri
vate of Company E, Third Artillery, while
out driving with a comrade lost control
of the team of mules and before he could
subdue the fractious beasts was thrown
over a bank. He- fell underneath the
heavy cart and was picked up in an un
conscious condition. His right hand was
crushed and three of the fingers broken,
and he also sustained numerous bruises
about the head and body.
An insane patient at the general hos
pital attacked the hospital barber, who
was sent to cut the patient's hair. The
man seemed perfectly docile, behaving in
a rational manner, until the attendants
had left, when he jumped from the chair
and proceeded to handle the barber with
out gloves. The arrival of a half dozen
stewards prevented the patient from do
ing any serious Injury, but it required
their combined strength to subdue him.
It has been found necessary to keep him
in a straitjacket ever since.
Major Keaean, who was severely
wounded in the assault on Tientsin, and
who has since his return to this country
been under treatment at the general hos
pital la very ill. The gunshot wound In
the arm. which was apparently mending
rapidly, broke out^ afresh, prostrating the
major. "While his condition is serious a
fatal result is not expected.

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The exporting firm cf J. Brett & Co. has
failed for $302,i&3 50. The petition In insol
vency was H!ed in the Lniied States Dis
trict Court yesterday morning. The as
sets of the linn are announced as $213,
tit>3 05.
The failure ia one of the biggest that
has occurred In this city in a long time,
and It is the more^ serious because cf the
small hope of the rirm continuing in busi
ness. It is not believed It can survive
the blow. The cause of the failure lies
In the recent and sudden bankruptcy of
J L,. and E. Knechti bankers, of Paris,
France, who were the financial backers
of the Brett Company and were supposed
to be very wealthy and tnoroughly e,uunÂ«l.
They failed tor several "million franc*,
ana in their fall they carried the tJrett
Company.
'Hit lirm of Jules Brett & Co. Is com
posed of J. L. and K. Knecht of Paris,
Julc-sChaipentierof Mazatlan, Mexico, and
Jules Brett of this city, manager of the
company. It has done business here for
two ami a half or three years. The firm
dealt in silks and European goods, Jap
anese goods, Chinese goods and general
exporting business. All bills were paid
u> drafts upon the Knechts in Paris.
When the Knechts failed thousands of
dollars In the paper of the Brett Com
pany came into the bank and it could not
be paid, so the Brett Company could do
nothing but seek, the courts with a peti
tion in insolvency.
The insolvent firm owes to Paris bank
ers more than $00,000. Its American cred
itors are: Ladenberg, Thai man & Co., 4S
Wall street. New York, $33,579 11; North
American Trim Company, 135 Broadway,
New York, $50,021 6S: First National Bank
of this city. J19.336 S3: Guaranty Trust
Company of New York. $16, S01 59: Bank of
California, San Francisco, $20,210 30; Kess
!er & Co., New York. $S921 63;' New York
Agency of th^ Bank of Montreal, 175,
154 <Â«: Schulz & PuÂ«kaber, New York,
$>900 42; G. Amsinck & Co., New York.
$31 Cl hi.
The principal assets are summed up as
follows: Stock. S7S.000; claim against the
Knechts, S3Â»j.lio; due the firm on open ac
counts. $70,000; money in bank. $26,000.
Process .will have to be served on the
Paris partners before the Insolvency pro
ceedings can be completed, and in Â¦ the
meantime the business will be carried on
as best it run. The failure is looked upon
as an unforiunate but unavoidable dis
aster and one which does not in any way
reflect upon the honesty or business abil
ity of iir. Brett. It was supposed that
the Knechts of Paris were financially
pound as a nut, and their sudden failure
carried with them nearly all that had
reiled upon their backing.

BIG EXPORTING
FIRM FAILS FOR
A LARGE AMOUNT
The necessity for a series of confer
ences such as the successive Monday
luncheons provide for Is based on the pro
posed recommendations to be made for
legislation touching water rights, etc.
The engineer corps that has worited In
the field during the summer months has
reported quite fully concerning the legal
tangles, snarls and existing status! of. the
water problem at large, after investiga
tion of records, minutes of boards of Su
pervisors and decisions. It also has made
recommendations concerning legislation.
"At our luncheon each Monday," said
Mr. Thomas yesterday, "we will discuss
all these recommendations. The outcome
will be the foundation of a legislative pro
gramme. The time for drafting the nec
essary bills for enaction Into law Is none
too long. The matter is of such great im
portance to the State that deliberate con
sideration and a free expression of opin
ion is 'needed. The recommendations of
the engineers are now only rough drafts."
Mr. Thomas does not claim that the
luncheon meeting plan is original, but It
seems to be practical. The tlrst gather
ing of the advisory committee members
In this way will be held next Monday.
The Supervisors of Monterey County have
just appropriated tlOOQ out of the general
fund to complete the work on the Salinas
River.
William Th<jmas "has devised a scheme
to jet together the members of the ad
visory council of the California Water
and forest Association for conference.
Mr. Thomas Is president of the associa
tion. A vast amount of important busi
ness must be transacted before the meet
ing of the Legislature in January. The
members of the advisory committee arc
busy men and it is difficult to get them
toRether Ions enough to consider deliber
ately the work in hand. Mr. Thomas has
finally solved the problem. Yesterday the
oiflce force cf the Association was busied
in preparir.p and sending out notices that
the members are Invitee from now on to
meet ewry Monday at the Maison Riche
at luncheon.

In Jealous Rage Mrs. Nellie
Wells Assaults Miss
Sanborn.
Miss Fannie M. Sanborn, a dressmaker
at 1335 Howard street, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day afternoon for the arrest of her sister,
Mrs. Nellie Wells, wife of Daniel Wells, a
gripman, living at 223 San Jrse avenue,
on the charge of threats against life.
Some months ago Mrs. Wells went East
on a visit and her husband neglected to
write . her. Miss Sanborn wrote her
regularly every other day, but that did
not satisfy her and when she returned
about two weeks ago she accused her
sister of attempting to alienate her hus
band's affections.
Yesterday Mrs. Wells called upon Miss
Sanborn. and grabbing hold of a pair of
scissors, made two. attempts to stab her.
Miss Sanborn fled from the house, close
ly pursued by her unfurlated sister, who
had the scissors in her hand. Mrs. Wells
overtook her sister at a butcher shep on
Ninth and Howard streets and seizing a
whip thai was In a wagon in front of the
shop, struck her twice across the should
ers with it, shrieking that she would km
her. Some bystanders lnterferred and
Miss Sanborn made her escape. Â§She
hurried to' the Hall of Justice and swore
to the warrant.
Mi.=r Sanborn denied that her sister
had any justification for her Jealousy and
said that she had more than once threat
ened to take her life. She was afraid 'she
would carry out her threat. She de
clared that shÂ« would not return home
till she knew that her sister had been ar
rested.
Mrs. Wells was arrested during the
afternoon and taken to the Seventeenth
street station. While waiting to be trans
ferred to the Central Prison she sent a
note to her husband. (asking him to come
to her. He indignantly refused to come
and tore the note into pieces. The wife
then sent for Wells' sister, with whom she
was stopping, and who sympathizes with
her. This lady exerted herself and pro
cured bail for her. with John I. Sparrow
and Emma D. Hall as sureties, each of
whom qualified in the amount of $1000.

Columbia.
"Quo Vadis," the dramatization of
Slenklewlcz's tale of the horrors born un
der Nero's rule in ancient Rome, began
its second week at the Columbia last
evening. Though there are scenesin the
play that tend to shock the senses of the
unbelievijg. the magnificent staging of
the Famcland the acting of the principals
in this tragedy overbalance those feat
ures which some term objectionable. The
acting cf Marcus Ford as VInieius would
make stror^ a p'.ay of even less merit-
Mason Mitchell, who assumes Ihe role of
Petronius. lends to his part that elegance
which won for the Petronius of ancient
Rome the title, "arbiter elegantarium."
As "Poppaea. the Empress," Winifred
Bonnewitz secures the favor of the audi
ence, and not less appreciated are Elsie
Esmond as Eunice and Willard Newell as
Chllo Chilonides. The sacred concert
throughout the play under the direction
of E. EL Schmitz is one of the enjoyable
and appreciated features.
Fabbri Theater.
The opening of the Fabbri Theater at
Odd Fellows' Hall last night attracted a
iarge and enthusiastic audience. The pro
gramme consisted of an olio of high class
specialties and a musical comedy. Miss
L. Li'.Iian received, much applause and
flowers for her rendition of the song, "The
Flower Girl." in costume and for her
clever cakcwalk. Other participants in
cluded Edward B. Adams in clever imita
tions of stage characters and operatic se
lections by Signora Ines Canisl. The
farce comedy. "Tht; Peaceful Villa," dis
played the talents of T. Roland, A. Fisher
and Miss Rita tie Rovey. The operetta,
"A Marriage by lanterns." was well ren
dered by MIps Katie Krleg, Miss Daisy
Bishop. Miss Minnie Huff and D. M. Law
rence. The four-act comedy "Tlllle" con
cluded the performance, which will be re
peated every night this week.
Alharabra.
Alhambra.
"The Man From Mexico" repeated the
hit of the initial performance at the Al
hambra Theater, last evening. The audi
ence laughed from the beginning of the
second act to the end of the play,, with
little interruption. The work of Boniface
as Benjamin Fltzhew was clever. The
comments that applied to the production
of Sunday need not be unsaid in any par
ticular. There â¢will be fun enough at the
Alhambra this week to draw crowds
nightly.

Lively Chase on Market Street.
John Bandoni. a butcher doing business
at 135 Hayes street, had a lively time
yesterday morning on Market street in
his attempt to escape from a posse of
policemen in a patrol wagon. Bandoni,
while driving along Market street, ran
over 11-year-old L. C. West at the cross
ing of Fifth street. Bandoni whipped up
,hia horse acd drove off. but Detective
Jack Fitzgerald of the Mission division,
whe was riding on a Valencia-street car.
Jumped off and. borrowing a bicycle,
started in pursuit. The chase created
considerable excitement. The patrol
wagon coming in from the Stanyan-street
station in charge of Policeman C. Water
man joined in the chase, but the butcher
finally reached his shop, where he tried
to hide. He was arrested and charged
with battery. West resides with his
parents at 6u2 Mission street. The little
fellow was not seriously injured, although
both wheels of the wagon passed over
him.
Little Girl Strays From Home.
Little eight-year-old Annie Farren h.n*
disappeared from her home at 127 Valley
street, near Church, and her uncle. T. J.
Rattigan. has instituted a search for her.
The little one was kept from school by
orders of a physician, and, beins: very
fond of her studies, she rebelled. Yes
terday morning she requested permission,
of her aunt to go to school, and on beir.cj
refused, apparently resumed her play.
A short time after, when her aunt looked
for her, she was not in sight. She i3 a
bright little one an.l well able to te:l
where she lived. When last seen shÂ«s
wore a large straw hat and a faded calico
dress with brown figures.
I FOUND myself hungry and without i
money and as I was determined not to |
steal I concluded to surrender myself
in the hope that I would not be
> â¢ severely punished. I knew I would
fall into the clutches of the detectives
sooner or later anyway and as I was tired
Vodging them I made up my mind to give
myself up."
Thus spoke Albert Loux. the flfteen
year-old boy who stabbed and killed
Daniel Harney, another boy, about nine
weeks ago, to Detective Cody at tha
Loux home on Mason street yesterday
: afternoon.
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon Gabriel Loux, Albert's 8lster, visited
the office cf the Chief of Police and an
nounced that her brother was anxious to
surrender himself. She said that he wa^
at his home and was waiting for an officer
to place him under arrest.
Captain Seymour sent Detective Cody
with Miss Loux and on entering the house
he found young I>iux seated in the parlor.
Recognizing the detective the boy grabbed
his hand and announced that he was
ready to surrender himself.
"I'm tired of tramping about the coun
try," he laughingly remarked. "Every
place I went I imagined that a policeman
was after me. I have come back for the |
purpose of surrendering myself and wani
to be taken to prison." ' !
Accompanied by his slsier young LoTjx
was escorted to the City. Prison, where
he was formally charged with murder.
To a reporter he said:
"I did not know that I had stabbed
Harney until some time after the trouble.
His brother Charles and I had some words
and losing my temper 1 slapped his fax-e.
He ran into his house and told Dan that
I had beaten him. In a few minutes Dan,
who was much taller and heavier than I.
appeared on the scene and after accus
ing me of taking advantage of his brother!
struck me in the Jaw. knocking me out. -j
When 1 recovered my senses I attempted
to regain my feet, when he again knocked
me down and then kicked me repeatedly.
â¢'My shoestring had become untied in
the pcuffie and taking out a small pocket
knife I started to cut it. Just then Har-
ney made a rush at me and jumping to
my feet I told him to keep away. With
out heeding my warning he aimed another
blow- at me and In the mtxup I suppose
he was cut. As he fell back with a cry
of pain I threw the knife away and ran
down the street. He shouted to me that
I had stabbed him. but thinking he was
Joking 1 kept on running:.
"About an hour later I started to go
home, but when I saw three policemen
in front of my house, evidently waiting
for me. I became frightened and ran
away. Meeting an acquaintance named
Sam Fass I told him about the trouble
I had with Harney. Fass expected to get
a job driving a wagon for a wholesale
firm that morning and he asked me to go
with him to XInth and Brannan streets,
where his prospective employers kept
their wagons. He was given the job and
told to return at 6 o'clock in the morning
to take out the team. We then walked to
Townsend street and went to sleep in a
boxcar. We were back at the stable on
time and Fass was' given his team. Wo
drove around all the next day, and as I
learned that the detectives were scouring
the city for me I bade Fass good-by,
telling him that I intended to go away.
"I had 60 cents with me and going to
the ferry bought a ticket for Oakland.
I slept in the railroad yards until dusk,
when I started to walk to Vallejo Junc
tion. From there I went to Tracey and
thf-n to Fresno, where I made ?15 picking
grapes.
"After leaving Fresno I traveled by
easy stages to Los Angeles, frequently
beating my way by assisting the tiremeh
on freight trains. I remained In Los
Angeles only about twelve hours arid
more anxious. than ever to give myself up.
"I finally concluded to return" to this
city. I reached here Friday morning: at
1 o'clock and plept in a freight car. After
leaving the car I walked along Fourth
street and met a friend named John Hol
land. He advised me to surrender myself
as the police were hot after me and that
it would be better if I gave myself up.
After leaving him I went to the Presidio
;Â»nd remained there until Saturday night
when I returned to my home. The next
day was Sunday and as I diu not want to
be arrested on the Sabbath 1 decided not
to surrender myself until to-day."

EVADING THE POLICE FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS.
Shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday afier
noon two men entered the saloon of John
Bauer at 624 Seventh street and called for
beer. One of the men tendered a ?3 gold
piece in payment and Bauer took out a
bag of silver containing $37 and started
to make change.
Just tthen one of tho men struck him
over the hoad with some blunt instru
ment, felling him to the Uoor.
John AlcCabe, a peddler, who was in the
saloon at the time, went to Bauer's as
sistance and was knocked down, receiving
an ugly scalp wound. He was threatened
with being made a subject for the Coro
ner if he did not remain quiet. The men
then snatched the bag of silver from
Bauer's hand and quickly disappeared.
Both Bauer and McCabe were taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where their in
juries, which consisted of several scalp
wounds, were dressed. There is- no citw
to the perpetrators of the crime.

of his youth in Oroville, and no doubt se
cure a cordial greeting, as every one in
that region knows him. Next Monday the.
Senator will address the veterans at
Yountville. He will speak at the Veter
ans' Home in the afternoon and at Napa
in the evening. Leaving the Napa Valley
the Senator will go to the region of orange

J. C. Sims, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, was asked yes
terday if he believed that Bryan would
carry California. He replied, saying that
such was his belief, but he was not pre
pared to make an estimate of the major
ity by which his candidate, would win.
Mr. Sims and Mayor Phelan are going
into the San Joaquin Valley to talk Bry
anism. There are some assurances that
the Mayor may obtain an audience out-
Side of San Francisco, hence he is billed
to speak Thursday at Fresno, Friday at
Los Angeles, Saturday at San Bernardino
and Monday next at San Diego. To make
assurance of attendance doubly sure, Sen
ator Sims is announced to speak on the
same platform with the Mayor at all of
those places.

M. Troppmann is also listed to speak.
The Democratic State Central'Commit
tee announces that ex-Senator Stephen

Tho Swedish Society will hold a reunion
at Shell Mound Park next Sunday. The
society has requested Republican speak
ers to address the assemblage.
H. W. Philbrook, Republican, goes on
the official ballot as a candidate for State
Senator to represent the Twenty-first Sen
atorial District. Martin Kelly gave or
ders to tho B'nal B'rith Hall delegations
to nominate Bddie Wolfe In that district,
and the orders were obeyed by the su
perviceable convention. This nomination
so disgusted the good citizens of the
Twenty-first that they came out openly
and declared that they would vote against
Kelly's man Wolfe. The Democratic con
vention nominated V W. E. White, a capa
ble and clean man for the Senate. The
Republicans who cannot make up their
minds to vote for .a Democrat to repre
sent the district, will have the opportu
nity of voting for Mr. Philbrook, a man
who will not take orders from Boss Kelly.
The Union League Club's committee on
political action .has prepared the follow
ing address to the voters of California:
Experience has shown that the primary elec
tion is the weak point in our system of gov
ernment. Through repeating, ballct-box etuff
ine and other kinds of frauds the boss too
often succeeds In controlling nominating con
ventions, thus depriving the honest voter of
that voice in his party"s affairs to which he is
justly entitled and by which alone can party
management be kept free from corrupting in
fluences, o
The only war to prevent this condition Is to
have a primary law like the one that enabled
the people of San Francisco a year ago to have
an honest primary election, resulting In the
complete defeat of boss Influence, but that law
was declared unconstitutional, and under the
opinion of the Supreme Court we- can have no
effective primary law without an amendment
to the constitution, such as constitutional
amendment No. i, to be voted on at the ccm
ini- election.
Cast your ballot for that amendment and get
your friends to da the same.
The friends of Gaillard Stoney, Demo
cratic nominee for Superior Judge for un
expired term, have organized a club in
his support. Judge Jeremiah F. Sullivan
Is president of the organization and Louis
de F. Bartlett is chairman of the execu
tive committee.
The police have captured another
"woman in black." who. It la alleged, en
tered several houses In the "Western, Ad
dition with the aid of skeleton keys and
stole considerable plunder.
Her name is Mary Meyers. She was ar
rested yesterday afternoon by Detectives
Harper and Armstrong while in tho act
of trying to dispose of a portion of her
booty. The woman is about 50 years of
age and when arrested was dressed In,
deep mourning.
During: the past week numerous com
plaints have been received by the police
concerning: the operations of a "woman in
black" who was operating in the Western
Addition. Detectives Harper and Arm-
Strong were detailed to run her down.
Yesterday afternoon, while walking alon?
Grant avenue, they saw a woman answer-
Ins the description of the female house
breaker enter a pawnshop near Sutter
street.
They followed her and caught her In tho
act of trying to sell a woman's jacket of
the latest pattern. "When asked where
she obtained the garment she pave an
evasive reply and started to leave tho
place. The detectives took her to tho
City Prison, where her name was regis
tered on the detinue book.
Detective Harper is satisfied that tho
woman is an old hand at the business.
He 13 strongly convinced that she has
been In prison before.
Police Believe Her Guilty
of Numerous Recent
Robberies.
ANOTHER WOMAN
BURGLAR CAUGHT
Thtt old complication of mistaken iden
tity doe.5 duty .for the rrillicnth time in
Mr. John Fowler's farce. "A Hindoo
Hoodoo," presented at the California
Theater last night. In the treatment one
is glad to detect and to acknowledge a
trace of eri/rinallty; That A's soul should
inhab't B"s body, compelling B to actions
nt variance with h:s recognizable person
ality, is a conception a trifle above the
ordinary and or.e that in pklllful hands
might be mucked so as to yield a rich .crop
of comic complications. How Labiche â
who, ss Augier has said, lacked only bit
terness to be considered a great man â how
Labirhe would have revelled !n such a con
ception! Hut Mr. Fowler is not a Labiche:
he *s not even Â«. De Suchet. He has lost
half his comic possibilities by making A
pometirr.es conscious that he is not B but
A. The moment th!s is forced upon the
audience 'the situation loses its strength
and the dialogue all dramatic point.
Many will s^ In this farce nothing
more Than a plagiarism, conscious or un
conscious, of "My Frifri! from India."
But Theoflophy offers such a wide field
for tb,e satirist that it is hardly fair to
pay that because one man has ploughed
a corner of it. none other? must venture
vithin its aVable confines.
Mr. Lursen. who plays the principal
character. haÂ«s a voice almost as dry and
.a face almost as expressionless as Mr.
Robsnn'p. These fit him admirably for
the kind of part he has in this piece. Mr.
Byen and Mr. Morton are both experi
enced actors, who know their business
thoroughly and do what llltte they have
to do well. The younger men in the cast
have pone on the stage before, learning
how to ppeak a sentence clearly or to
make a point emphatically; such crude
work is all too common on our stage and
comes from inexcusable lack of training.
As to the ladies, the littTe girl who plays
Mnttle Lockette should be in the gram
mar school Instead of singing stupid songs
in public: her performance Is a cruelty
alike to herself and to the public. The
parts of Mrs. Gushmore and Miss Money
rocks are so Inexpressibly foolish that it
is not possible to say whether they were
flayed cr not; there was nothing in them
to play. Miss Anna Boyd is libeled by
Tier pictures; she has. in truth, a beautiful
rtage presence, real distinction of manner
and a deliciously clear-cut enunciation.
To see such beauty and such talent
wasted upon cocn songs and imitations of
drunken women is truly pitiable.
Tivoli.
L. DU PONT STLE.
A. celebration performance In honor of
the eighty-eighth anniversary of the birth
of Verdi was held last evening at the
Tlvoll Opera-house, which was crowded to
the doors with enthusiastic admirers of
the genius of the "grand old man" of
Ita!y.
A splendid programme was arranged, as
follows: "Nabuoco" overture; third act
of "Aida." -with Barbareeehi. Politlnl.
Castellano, NicolinI and Ferrari; fourth
act cf "Ritroletto." with Russo, Ferrari.
Rert^tto. Xieolir.t and Politlni; second act
of "â¢Otello." with Salaspa. Castellano and
Arthur Boyce; and the fourth act from
"11 Trovatore," with Russo, Ferrari,
Anna I-ichter and Arthur Rnyce-. A solo
for euphonium from "The Masked Ball"
was played V>y Walter H. Colverd and a
bass solo was sung by Signor Lucente.
Ttie bright, particular .star of the even
ins?- was. of course. Salassa. His lago is
a joy fnrevcr. He Is a thorough artistâ
in this a preat artist. One is grateful, too,
for the admirable costume, po character
istic of the picturesque period In which
the opera is pet. for his supple and grace
ful g-csture. his marvelous facial mobility
p..nd the voice which so wonderfully ex
presses every dominant emotion. Braval
braviÂ«simo. Salassa. Nice Barbareschi
pleases as Airta. She Is eminently grace
ful, has an intense dramatic power and a
fine, full soprano voice, not used always
s=o well as might be. For the rest the
crtists are all known, their work Is al
ways appreciated and never more than
last evening.
Orpheum.
Lizzie TJ. Raymond, the character eom
cdiennp. is the hcadliner at the Orpheum
this week. Last night she made quite a
hit with her songs, particularly the one
imitating a Cockney miss. Her Irish song
about McCarthy and the brick was also
cleverly pun? and actM. She met with
an enthusiastic reception, showing that
frhe has lo?t none of her popularity. Ed
par Atchisnn-Ely, in his burlesque in cos
tume of the possibilities in dress of the
future dufV, was well received and made
a favorable impression. Rauchle. an im
personator of famous men. past and prer
ont, is clevor. Mo?t of his Impersonations
wore f;.!thful. Tho twin sisters Hale,
vocalists and dan errs, are more attractive
with thr-lr feet than with their voices.
The holdoversâ tho Willis troupe of In
ftruinentallsts: Eddie GIrard and Miss
Jessie Gardner; Tom Nawn and company;
the Great Everhard, the hoop-rolling
marvel, and The American biogrraphâ
were us highly appreciated as before, the
â¢whole making a. most attractive bill.
Alcazar.
Dumas' Fail s:ory of human passion as
exemplified in the vrndetta was strikingly
told la.'t nierht in Howard Hall's arrange
ment of "The Cors-ican Brothers" before
a h'.phly pleased audience In the Alcazar.
The play went smoothly for a lirst night.
jUthough the waits between acts seezned
todious. Howard Hall in the dual role
actrd with true melodramatic fire and
was recalled several times before the cur
tain, but he is a horribly bad fencer with
the rapic-r and a burlesque with the dag
ber. Mr. Bryant, the Chateau Renaud of
the play, fences well with the sword, but
throws the spectators into a cold perspira
tion left he commit hara-kiri with the
broken half. Dorothy Dorr is too ponder
ously Saxon for the role of the frivolous
Frenchwoman. Emilie de Lesparre. al
though her lines are well spoken. The
fun of the melancholy play Is furnished
by Clarence Mxmtalne and George P.
Webster as the heads of the vendetta
rlans, and In the reconciliation scene Mr.
"Webster broke the stage record by hand-
at Orpheum, Alharabra
