There is but one thing paramount in

culminate, to this end.
Since the settlement of this country by white
people, nearly four hundred years ago. tho
financial system has never been so perfect and
entirely satisfactory as at the present time.
True progress is based on the bedrock of con
servatism, which, properly Interpreted, means
hold on to all the good things you have, and
get as many more as you can.
If any subject approaches paramountcy, it is
the science of national finance, as every busi
ness transaction is weighed by money.
Taking advantage of the experience of the
world in money lore, we have now a currency,
founded on bimetallism, with gold aa the
standard, that performs its functions with
perfection, and defies the criticism of the
world. Thomas Jefferson asserts the historical
fact that a double standard is no standardâ
that money made of gold and silver, though
temporarily in ratio, will finally go to their
bullion value. In the early history of thÂ«
country, when the precious metals werÂ«
scarce, sliver was the standard, and the only
coin that could buy land.
The chemlco-mechanical forces for unearth
ing the precious metals have so augmented
within the fifty years last passed, that they
are, comparatively, plenty and cheap. Gold
may now be the standard. Last year tho
world's output of gold nearly equaled J40O.-
WO.OOO. In the near future, when the South
African gold mines will be reopened, the gold
yield of the globe will reach, at least J500.000,-

Report of Auditor for Past Fiscal
BERLIN, Sept. 30.â The most striking
feature of the Bourse last week was the
smoothness of the monthly settlement. Not
for years had Berlin seen such an easy
September settlement. Yesterday private
discount fell one-eighth, which is very un
usual at the end of September. The mar
ket expects the reichsbank to be able to
meet all money demands for the next ten
days without raising the rate, which is
also something of a phenomenon, not hav
ing occurred before for five years.
The Bourse was somewhat more agi
tated than usual <Â¦Â¦ during the week. A
sharp rise In industrials occurred on
Wednesday owing to the scarcity of
shares for the carry over. This was not
maintained, however, and the week closed
-vith this department of the market show
ing a decline.
Generally speaking, the trading was de
cidedly in favor of the bears. Imperial and
Prussian funds suffered severely through
the announcement that Hamburg had de
cided to raise a loan of 40.000,000 marks,
choosing the 4 per cent type. A similar
.depressing Influence was exerted by the
intimation that the Saxon Government
contemplates a new loan at a higher In
terest than the old 3 per cent. The week's
decline in imperial threes was 90 pfennigs
and in Prussian .threes 100.
The first quotation on the Berlin Bourse
of the New York German loan was 100.
There were heavy private and public
sales of iron and coal shares during the
week owing to unfavorable reports from
the iron centers. Hank stocks suffered se
verely from a bear attack, the bears ar
guing that the banks are overloaded with
industrials, now heavily depreciated and
unsalable. It is also pointed out that the
refusal of the provincial bankers to use
the Bourse register, which occurred fre
quently during the week, must reduce the
business of the great banKs. o
The decline 'i in Canadian Pacific and
Northern Pacific was followed at thcerd
of tho week by a. strong recovery, the
market beingrcassured by the ready ab
eorptlon at New York of the German of
ferings. I ; o
Â« The Dortmund Union Iron Works has
reconsidered the recent decision to Issue
new shares to the c amount of 10.000,0)0
marks. Debentures to the amount of
6,000,000 marks will be Issued instead, and
the financial press expects the 5 per cent
type. , -- '..'Â¦>

Two Men Have Been at Odds

pected in Future.
Sr^clal DlFpatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Sept. SO.â In a row in
the Waldorf saloon at an early
hour this morning Chief of Po
lice Stanford was . severely
beaten by the proprietor, W. R.
Acock. The Chief fired one shot at his
antagonist, but was blinded by blood, and
the bullet flew wide of its mark.
For pome time past. or. In fact, ever
clnce the Police Department was Installed
under Chief Stanford. Acock and Stan
ford have had more or less trouble, Acock
insisting that Chief Stanford keep out of
his saloon, and Chief Stanford taking the
ground that he must, in pursuance of his
duty, oversee every place of the kind in_
town. Early this morning Chief Stan
ford was on duty, and was informed that
trouble was brewing in Acock"Â» resort. He
immediately proceeded to investigate. At
the entrance of the place he was stopped
by Acock, who said he should not enter.
Stanford forced his way In. and on the
inside was assaulted by Acock, who used
the butt of his revolver for a weapon,
and inflicted a severe though not danger
ous Â« iund upon the scalp of the Chief
of. lr-<-iice. '
At this Stanford drew his revolver and
fired one shot at Acock, who' was being
held by some of the men who stood about
the barroom. This was the only shot
nred during th# melee. Chief- Stanford
was seized and held by onlookers, who
feared the affray might end In the death
of one of the combatants.
Officer Scully, who was also on duty,
heard the shot, and hastened to the re
sort. Vpon reaching the place he was
ordered by Stanford to place Acock un
der arrest, which he did, but not until
Acock had put his revolver into the
hands of a friend and gtanford had pock
eted his own. Acock was taken to jail
and charged vrith assault with a deadly
weapon with Intent to murder.
Two thousand dollars was set as ball,
which was at once furnished.
The story of the trouble does not come
as a surprise to those who have watched
the conduct of the Waldorf of late. While
neither party cares to discuss what J will
be done In the matter, the Chief stolidly
maintains that he will do what he con
siders his duty, guns or no guns.
The affair has been the general topic of
conversation in Vallejo to-day, and there
Is considerable difference of opinion.
Acock's friends hold that the saloon has
been conducted in an orderly manner, and
the Chief should not have Interfered. Oth
ers commend the Chief for doing wliat

General MacArthur has declined to oon
cldor many resignations that have been

President on the ground that the services
of the officers cannot be dispensed with
and that they must remain on duty until
discharged. Tho War Department has no

it understands that it was large and 'that

become demoralized had any disposition
to accept the resignations been shown.
The department has for good and suf

pome thirty volunteer officers during the
past fiscal year. But three officers of the
regular army have resigned their commis

services began shortly after 4 o'clock and
when the deep tones of the organ rolled
out the voluntary every seat In the
church was occupied and the aisles were
filled with friends of the children, who
devoutly followed the service. After the
children had sung "VenI Creator" his
Grace the Archbishop entered the sanc
tuary and Invested himself in cope and
mitre. The children approached iae com
munion rail, the boys first, followed by
the girls, and reverently knelt while the
ceremony of anointment was enacted.
After the last child had returned to her
pew Archbishop Riordan made a fe,w re
marks. He intended making an extended
address, but was deterred from doing so
on account of a severe cold, with which
he has been suffering: since his return
from Rome. His Grace said:
""My dear children, I wish to congrat
ulate you and j-our pastor upon the beau
tiful church that you worship in. My re
marks must be very brief, as I have a
severe cold. Keep on in your good works
and all work to wlpa the debt off your
church so that it may be a monument of
love to our holy religion."
At the close of the Archbishop's re
marks solemn benediction was delivered
by Rev. Father Cottle of St. Brigld's
Church.
The following priests were in the sanc
tuary during the ceremony: Fathers

NEW YORK. Eept. 30.â Another over
whelir.ir.ging .victory for President Mc-
K3nley in th> electoral college is fore
ehadowed in a poll of States made by the
Herald. As. shown by the table below, 258
electoral votes seom to be assured to the
Presidentâ only thirteen less than he're
coived in 1^5... with Idaho, Indiana; and
Montana doubtful. Mr. Bryan seems ias
evred of only.lCS votes, eight less xbjari'he
received in 1S36: Â¦ ' â¢' |
But, as pointed out, the Democrats to
succeed must make other gains from the
Republicans than from Illinois. Mr. Bry
an ha* only fairly started on his speaking
campaign; He has great faith in his per
suasive eloquence and expects to set the
earth on fire this month. David R. Hill,
says Bryan, is going to steadily grow in:
strength and will be elected. Wnat-arp
apparently reliable estimates at "Â¦. present
may have to be revised after .Bryan's
Eastern tour. . . . - : ".':'Â¦': 'Â¦ '
. ; The- : wor?t : situation for the i^epublicans
is in Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago
is situated. The Republicans expect Cook
County to go against them because of
labor troubles in the buildin? trades.
Cook County went for McKinley In 1S36 by
f9,677, but Illinois outside of Cook County
gave McKinley 72.S21 plurality. The prob
lem now is to have the vote of Chicago
Â¦swamped 'by the farmer vote of the rest
of the State. : =â¢
The: best Information obtainable is that
the R>publicar.s have no chance whatever
to .carry' MlEsouri, Colorado, Utah and
Nevada, which they are claiming, and
that the Democrats have an equally hope
less prospect in their efforts to break into
the States of New York/' New Jersey or
Connecticut.

' Tho new bill which opens at the Chutes
to-day promises' to be "one of' the best
ever seen' at' that place. The new faces
are: Jessie Padgham, the celebrated so
prano; Arnold Grazier and Hazel Calla
nan, Annie Goldle, coon . shouter; John
Pamplin. Juggler, and Zoyarro and St.
Clair. The rest ofthe bill Includes the
best numbers from last week's pro
gramme. "V'^'.-;
Walter Walker and his company opened
a week's engagement at the Alhambra In
"That Man" at the ? . matinee . yesterday,
playing to a goodly sized audience then
and at night. The play is a farce comedy
abounding in amusing situations.' It takes
its title from the character of Theophilus
Montjoy, '-, "That Man," who becomes
a professional "Jealousy- arouser" in tho
Interest of wives neglected by their hus
bands. Walter Walker takes the part
cleverly, and Percy. S. - Sharp as Squibs
portrays the English servant excellently.
Mildred St. Pierr.e is pleasing in the part
of the girl who masquerades now as a.
French singer, now as a Spanish dancer
and again as an. Italian painter, ensnar-.
ing the while the husbands of the women
who employ "That Man."
Eddie Foy Is In town again with a new
farce â "A Night In Town." He opened, to
a full house last evening at the Columbia;
one fringed with latecomers around the
side aisles and the foyer and a '.'standing
room only" sign at the box office after 8
o'clock. He was enthusiaBtlcally-recelved,
and those who were waiting to see him
saw the same old Eddie Foy that has been
responsible for so many overworked
laughter muBcles and broken waistbands.
There is not much to "A Night -in
Town" except Eddie himself, but thero
are some clever things tn which he gets
good assistance from his company. The
vivacious Miss Tanguay divides honors
with him and Charles A. Mason as Dr.
Adam Krautensauer makes a third mem-'
ber of the company worthy of distinction.
Foy is David Bcarem, a victim of the ci
garette habit, who is under the care of the
German doctor. The complications he
weaves around himself and the others
give three acts of laughable nonsense
punctuated with some bright songs and
lively dances. The songs are good and
new, and one of them, "Ma Zulu Babe,"
is of the kind that lasts. It is a catchy air
and will become popular. Charles K.
French as Horace Williams and Ida Prin
gle as his wife furnished the only plot to
the piece, a surreptitious trip to' the
"French ball" by each unknown to the
other, although Foy complicates matters
by falling In love with Mrs. Williams in
his own peculiar fashion. May Whiting
takes the part of a deaf mute in love
with David and also that of Celeste, the
dancing girl that raised trouble for Wil
liams and for Josiah Leonard, his father
in-law, played by Joseph Standlsh. There
is a shrewish mother-in-law, a terror from
the Wild West, and all the farce comedy
the three acts will. hold. The piece will
run a week. , * :â¢ *
Querita Vincent will be. at the Olympla
this week.
Fischer's CQncert house announces as
new attractions Moll and Moulton, Carroll
and Robert Ellis. The De Gosco brothers,
Antonio Vargas and Mae Tunison are
among the holdovers. . . ;
The Alcazar Theater announces for the
week's bill "We 'Uns of Tennessee," a
military comedy drama by Lee Arthur. It
is said that the piece has made a' hit in
New York, and with the present good
company should repeat its Gothamite suc
cess at the Alcazar. : >
The Tivoli Opera-house is to the fore
this v.-oek with a varied bill, no less than
four operas being on the programme.
Chief .in Interest among these is "The
Huguenots," perhaps the most Important
of Meyerbeer's operas and which has not
been heard here for many years. A fine
production is promised, and with the
Tlvoli's conscientious attention to detail
is. assured and the full cast required will
give opportunity for the' hearing of a
lnrge contingent of the clever principals
of the season.' Th* list of singers includes
Berthald, Ferrari, i Nicolini, Schuster.
Stewart. Graham and Repetto. "Carmen"
will be sung on Wednesday and 1 Saturday
evenings. withSalassa and Russo in the
cast. "Faust"' and "Mignon." will. make
up the rest of the bill.
The chnrua fell lamentably short in
places and the orchestra did fairly well.
For to-night "Aidn" has bpen announced
in place of "Lucia," to give Mme. Bruni
an opportunity for further rest.
Of course, "Carmen" is "Carmen." The
witcheries, treacheries, sudden passions
and indifferences of. the fascinating Span
ish Jade are the play, and Jt.ls fortunately
so In this instance,' for only Carmen ner-
Belf was happily suited ;to her part,- But
what a Carmen! Abs/jlutely the best, we
have had here for lo! these 'many y#ars.
A true contralto voice, round,, full, flex
ible, of exquisite' timbre and lending itself
superbly to the fascinating Collamarmi
conception of the part, it leaves nothing
to be desired. The singer looks the part,
too, is most .picturesquely gowned and
twirls the castanets like a true daughter
Of Spain. Her dance. is a delight and a
revelation. Castellano falls short in the
Don Jose interpretation; he seems to be
out of sympathy with the role and did not
at all act up to the bewitching cigaretto
girl. He sings in' a desultory sort of
fashion and, ' except in piaces, his fine
voice is rarely heard to advantage.
Bellagambo's toreador â Escamillo â la
good, but by no means equal to hla mag
nificent Amouraso. "The 1'cre.ndor" sorijj
w&3 given in line style, but the voice
seems slightly heavy In the more florid
passages.
The audience was again disappointed in
the expectation of hearing the principal
lyric scprano of the company, Turconi
Bruni, who is Ftlll indisposed, and Sylvl*
Puerarl took her pnrt in Micaela. Fueran
has a light, fine voice, but was excusably
uncertain in her rendering of the part.

Incident which rather calculated to cool
the ardor of the bridegroom concerned. A
young couple were going through tha
marriage ceremony at the mairie of Gen
tllly and the bridegroom had already ans-,
wered the usual questions, "Wilt thou,'^
etc., with remarkable energy, when to th?
surprise of everybody, the' bride, to/a
similar Interrogatory, uttered a deciÂ«Â«d
"No," followed by a flood qt tears. / It
appears* that she had allowed the tega
tive to escape her quite involuntarily^ and
was anxious to correct the mistake,' For
this, however, she was obliged ti wait
several days, since the only legal yay out
of the difficulty was the republlcition of
the banna during the usual period.

in 1899 they numbered 121,881, an increase of 41,108;
the total deposits in 1894 were $38,426,037; by 1809
they had reached the sum of $56,307,107, making an;
increase of $17,880,980. Â»
The bank figures of the different States are not dis
similar in their showing to that of the statistics cited
for the Union as a.whole. Only a short time ago the
reports of. the banks of California were submitted to
the Bank Commissioners and attention was then di
rected to the wonderful increase in the amount of de
posits over those of the previous year. The increase
was especially notable in the deposits of the savings
banks, which represent the accumulations of the wage
earning classes.
Taking the records as embodied in official reports
for the year 1894, when Cleveland was President, an.l
for 1899, these figures are obtained: Total number of
depositors in all banks in the United States in 1894,
5.545.86>; total number in 1899, 7,655.414; increase in
the number of depositors during the five yean,
2,109,547.- Total amount of money deposited in all
banks in 1894, $2,874,589,406; total deposits in 1899,
$4,608,096,005; increase in the amount of deposits un
der the Republican administration, $1,733,506,599.
Not only has there been that increase in the num
ber of depositors and the amount of deposits, but the
average amount of each bank account has increased
from $520 in 1894 to $602 in 1899.
In the present campaign a study of bank reports is
essential to an understanding of the issues of the time.
The desire of the people is for prosperity, and since
the politics of a country necessarily affects trade and
business, it must-be the wish of all patriotic voters to
cast their ballots for the party whose policies will be
most likely to maintain and advance the welfare of
industry and commerce. If any citizen be in doubt as
to which party stands for prosperity in this country
the doubt can be settled by even the most casual study
of bank reports. Figures of that kind do not lie.
They cannot be juggled for campaign purposes. They
record exactly what has been accomplished by the
people in the way of earning and saving money.
WHEN all things are taken into consideration it
will be perceived that the net results of the
business of a people are to be found in the
records of the banks. The deposits \ represent first
the number of persons who are able to establish a
bank account out of their earnings or their wages, and
second the amount of that account. When times are
bad the number of depositors and the amount of de
posits diminish. When times are good they increase.
Thus by contrasting the deposits of one year with
those of another we have a fairly accurate measure
ment of the comparative degree of the prosperity of
the people.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
One of the strong arguments for the measure is
that it will put an end- to a practice on the part of
certain European manufacturers putting American
trademarks on their goods: Commenting on that
phase of the subject the Philadelphia Record says:
"It is true that regulations already exist on the Conti
nent, where the imitation of American trademarks has
become: very widespread on account of the now
recognized superiority- of . American goods, and
Americans have themselves been largely to blame in
not securing the registration of their trade device? in
time; but if there should be a reciprocal arrangement
the way of the counterfeiter would be made much
harder. He is a wise business men who, foreseeing
the possible introduction of his goods in all countries,
secures in time both at home and abroad all the pro
tection which the patent and trademark laws may
afford."*
Of the desirability of such an act there will be little
question. Almost every well established trademark is
subject to forgeries or imitations. These offenses are
frequently as injurious to the public as to the pro
ducer whose articles and advertising have given the
mark a value. In some respects, moreover, the trade
mark law would promote the movement toward the
prevention of the adulteration of foods and medicines,
for many of the articles of that nature that carry
forged, or deceptive trademarks are also spurious in
their composition.' ' ;.Y : Â« :
; The measure is one of considerable importance to
the business world. In the first place, it is 'to be
noted, it will give a particular trademark to the per
son who first makes application for it. Doubtless that
provision would be so guarded that no well-known
trademark could be taken by. some one not- justly en
titled to it, but where several existing marks are very
similar to one another it will be well for the owners
to watch the progress of the measure closely, so- as
to be ready to file a claim as soon as it becomes law.
From the reports that have come to us it appears
the proposed measure provides for the registration in
the Patent Office of trademarks upon payment of a
fee of $10, and for the recognition of the first applicant
as the owner of the trademark. Another important
piovision is that any citizen of a foreign country may
register a trademark here under the same conditions
as an American citizen, provided that the nation to
which he may owe allegiance shall accord the same
privilege to Americans.
PROTECTION FOR TRf!DEMf1RKS.
AMONG the subjects discussed by the American
Bar Association at its recent meeting at Sara
toga was that of providing legislation for es
tablishing a greater security to the proprietors of
trademarks in all lines of business. The sentiment of
the association was strongly in favor of action, and a
measure was prepared for submission to Congress
which declares the counterfeiting of a trademark, or
the close imitation of it with intent to deceive, a crimi
nal offense, punishable by fine or imprisonment
Wheat advanced nt the opening, but fell back at
the close of the week. . The foreign demand for corn
fell off in consequence of advanced prices. In the
San Francisco market cereals were generally sustain
ed-except wheat, which is governed by universal and
not local conditions. Barley advanced with some ra
pidity, as country holders, tired of selling at the low
prices, are now keeping back their supplies, and the
San Francisco buyers have advanced their bids to
obtain stocks. There was also a marked advance in
hay during the week. The demand for this staple
continues sharp for Oriental account, and at the pres
ent rate it will not !<c long ere good hay is scarce.
Cran and Middlings have also gone up under light
supplies, and the other. feedstuff s are following these
leaders, so forage is doing'.bctter all around. Canned
fruits have met with, such a good, demand thus far
this season that, as already,. rnen'tioried, the canners

The only staples to show any feature during the
past week were iron and steel, coal, boots and shoes
and wool. Throughout the iron trade the remark
was frequently made that the bottom had been
touched, that certain companies had resumed orders
for supplies, that expert orders had been placed and
that more coke ovens were in operation. In boots
and shoes the demand, so long stagnant, is .pickinir
up. Shipments from Boston are slowly increasing,
the Western buyers are asking for prompt delivery,
and the New England jobbers report themselves busy.
The coal situation made a decided improvement, as
signs of a speedy resumption of work appeared, and
the strike :t c .elf developed much less feeling than had
been expected. Wool continued dull and unsatis

affected by famine conditions and heavy receipts.
TRADE QUIET. BUT IN GOOD TONE.
BUSINESS continues apathetic all over the coun

Since Wells-Fargo is so willing to shift upo^i the
people, and ,. especially upon the wage-earners, the
burdens of glory, so would they be ready to shift
upon the same classes the disasters of free coinage.
Mr. Valentine laments the evil plight of the working
man who has to pay taxes, but he overlooks the fact
that workingmen would have upon them a much
lighter burden of taxation if Wells-Fargo and other
corporations of the kind would pay their share of the
burden instead of shirking it upon others. In fact,
upon the head of Valentine "anti-imperialism" jingles
r.s brazenly as upon the head of Bryan, aad serves' no
ether purpose than that of attracting attention to
the mountebank who wears it.
- Of the danger of free coinage involved in the can
didacy of Bryan Valentine makes light sport. He says
in a letter to the New York Post: "Free silver is in
the dim, distant and shadowy future, where it will
doubtless remain." That is an easy creed for Wells-
Fargo and the express trust, since it is a safe guess
that every dollar due to them has by contract, been
made specifically payable in gold only, but how isit
for the men who work for the express companies?
Would not their wages be paid on a silver basis if
Bryan were. elected? Free silver would not be in the
dim, -distant and shadowy future for them.
In making those statements Mr. Valentine has the
merit of being candid.' Certainly Wells-Fargo intend
that the pe : ople shall pay all the taxes that Congress
may levy on express companies. Mr. Valentine
preaches what he practices when ' he says if the
people are satisfied to pay taxes they may, but he will
not coincide. The inveterate tax-shirker has shifted
from Wells-Fargo every bit of the burden of glory,
and we have no doubt he will continue to shift it to
the end.
Here is Valentine writing letters to every paper
that .will publish them, and, not content with thar,
printing them as^circulars and distributing them far
and .wide". His one cry is there are no true men in
America except those who , arc going to vote for
Bryan. His argument is simple. In a letter to the
Chicago Record he says: "Imposing 'benevolent as
similation' upon alien and unwilling people is a costly
luxury, and the people must foot the bills. If they
are satisfied with such a course, well and good; but
I cannot coincide." In a letter addressed to the Oak
land Saturday Night he returns to the argument and
repeats it thus: "If the wage-earners who must'pay
the bills for glory do not care, then imperialism is
ncre to stay."
SINCERE opponents of any policy of perma
â¢ nently "annexing the Philippines to the United
are sorely plagued in these days by the
mountebanks* of Bryanism who. have .made of
imperialism" a sort of fool's cap and bells wherewith
tc make a jingle as c they go prancing through the
campaign. The master mountebank is of- course,
Bryan himself, but he has on this coast a close seo
ondin President Valentine of Wells-Fargo Company
and- the great express trust. The course pursued* by
Senator Hoar, ex-Senator- Edmunds and others like
them, who oppose annexation and recognize that the
issue" can best be "met by the re-election of McKinley,
is Consistent with the highest statesmanship and the
truest citizenship, but the Bryanites are doing their
worst to make all antagonism to annexation some
thing absolutely ridiculous in the eyes of the public.

zbove all other in the local campaign. No Repub
lican should vote for such a candidate as the no
torious "Eddie" Wolfe, who does not represent either
the party or its principles in anything, nor shon'<l
Democrats support any man of a like character or
lack of character nominated on their ticket. The is
sue is to elect to the State Senate honest men who
will redistrict the State in an honest way, and in
nothing will be subservient either to the railroad
managers or to the slum bosses whom Mr. Herrin
rnd the Hon. W. C. Van Fleet have raised from ob
scurity to power. .... .. : '- * ; ' :
The chief reason of the desire of the railroad to con
trol the Legislature i3 that the Congressional, Sena
torial and Assembly districts of the State are to be re
arranged at the coming legislative session. If the rail
road can control the rearrangement, it can so gerry
mander the State as to give the corporation tools and
bosses an immense advantage in all struggles against
the people for ten years to come.
It is well known that the Southern Pacific Com
pany is eager to control the coming Legislature, and
to^that end its managers have combined Avith'. the
bosses of all parties. Por, example, before the Re
publican convention met inthe Eleventh Senatorial
District Mr. Herrin of the Southern Pacific, posed as
a Republican and promised railroad aid to any Re
publican who would defeat the nomination of C. M.
Belshaw. Failing to dominate the convention, Herrin
promptly turned his "push" over to the Democrats
of the district and is now working for the election
of Wilkins to beat Belshaw. Similar tactics will be
followed in this county and in every other county
where the Southern Pacific managers see a chanc
to elect any of their tools to office. â¢ .
THE.. STATE- SENATE.
BY reason of the conditions of the time, the elec
tion of -State "Senators from the variousÂ°Â°dis
tricts in San Francisco County, and; indeed,
from many, other Senatorial 'districts 1 of the State,
must be regarded this year by good citizens as some
thing outside of partisan politics. The action of the
Supreme Court iii declaring the Stratton primary law
invalid turned the primaries of both parties over td
the control of. the bosses, and as a consequence no
truly, representative Senatorial tickets* have beennomi-"
nated in this county. Good 'citizens must make their
choice among the candidates .without regard to the
party that nominated them; and in doing so- must en
deavor to select men who in office will not be sub
servient to bosses. ._ Â¦ '. â¢ â¢.-. .

POP" HARDIE. tenth man for
Oakland when he Isn't wanted \n
the field, was switched into the
game yesterday afternoon at Rec r
reation grounds in the ninth in
nlnp. when the Dudes came to bat for
their very last chance. The score was 2
to 1 in favor of "Sapho" and his muses.
"Pop" Hardie flew to center, but he prov
ed a mascot. After his quick death the
real excitement of the game begun. Dren
nan hit a hot one along: the ground to
Streib. who threw to Whalen. covering the
first bag. The ball was hij;h and Whalen
allowed it to slip through his "mitts."
When Drennan stopped running he had
already reached the third station. Up to
"Old Hutch" was the chance for the game
and he Improved his opportunity by a hit
to right field. Drennan smearing himself
on the plate as he tied the score.
All the Oakland rooters were in throes
of jubilation and wild noise making. They
worried Jimmie Whalen's sweet angelic
nature to such an extent that Captain
â¢â¢Stapleton" McCarthy had to come in
from the field and say unpleasant thing3
to his twirler. Graham, the Stockton
catcher, then felt prieved. and. before he
was ready to continue the game Lmplre
Huphev Smith was forced to use language
mildly "obscene. By this time the crow<i
was pulsating with excitement, and when
Hutchinson stole second Whalen was hit
with another deluge of noise.
But this was mild compared with the
torrential outburst that followed when
Francks singled and Hutchinson scored.
That ended the run making, but It was
enoueh to win for Oakland. ,
As Hardie was put in Mangerina's place
to bat Pete Lohman. Oakland's latest re
ceiver, was sent back of the plate for the
last of the ninth. For a time it looked, ns
if Stockton would tie the score. Streib,
with but one man dead, had reached the
middle station. Then Graham did just
what he should not have doneâ drove a
hard liner to Kelly, who doubled Streib
at second. That ended the game.
The game was fast, snappy and care
fully played -with but few exceptions. In
the sixth Graham lost control of his "top
works." and Instead of putting out Bow
man at the plate threw to second to catch
Mangerina. Bowman .scored. One of the
Miller's runs was due to a wild throw by
Francks to HutchSnson. the ball losing it
self in the crowd just long enough to give
McGucken a chance to score. The score:

MORNING GAME.
Stockton 4, Oakland 2.
Brilliant Mr. Francks. who sometimes
eats up balls that belong to the third
basenian. or the center lielder, was off in
his diamond work yesterday morning- on
the Oakland grounds. Just about the
same time that Francks fell to evil ways
Moskiman. who was on the slab for the
Dudes, lost control of his arm. This com
bination was hard to beat. When the
agony was passed Ewing listened to the
bell clanp four times, once each for Mc-
Carthy, McGucken. Moore and Graham.
These were the onlv runs made bv the
Millers.
In the sixth Oakland bunched a couple
of hits on Babbitt. Francks and Moski
man scoring. The game was exceptionally
fast. but less interesting on account of
Stockton's undisturbed lead. The score:

I The San Francisco Yacht Club held an
! interesting race yesterday for small
yachts; over a course off the Sausalito
'Clubhouse. Prizes were offered in two
\ classesâ for yachts having a racing length
i of more than twenty feet but not exceed
ing twenty-five feet, and for yachts hav
ing a racing lengtbfof less than twenty
fecL The only boat in the larger class
that put in an appearance was ihe Cor
inthian sloop Merope, but she did not
start. In the twect.v-f.ve foot class there
were half a dozen starters, ail but one of
which finished the course. The start was
across a line drawn from the club wharf
to the schooner LurMne. thence to a
jur.k moored over the site of Shag 1 Rock,
thence to a stakeboat anchored orf Angel
Island, and thence to the finishing line
off the clubhouse. The distance v.as esti
mated at about six miles.
The preparatory g~jn was fired at 12:S0
p. m. and the starting pun ten minutes
later. The little craft crossed the line
pretty well tog-ether, the ya-wl Kittiwake
having the advantage. The Kittiwake
stood well over toward Yellow Bluff, the
rest of the fleet poir.gr further oft shore.
A:"t?r gybing round Shag Rock the
msriners eagerly scanned the bay for the
stakeboat cSE Angel Island. All except
the Doris got down too far to leeward,
and, as a result. Arthur Pace's little
sloop rounded J. R. Savoy's Juanlta
ahead of all her competitors. The last
leg. however, of the triang-ular course
was a beat, and here the superior wind
ward work of the Kittiwake soon brought
her to the front. She was never caugHt.
and won a eood race by a fair margin.
Anita finished second, and Doris a
good third. The two first legs of the
course were reaches, and in this work
Doris more than held her own: but the
Kittiwake ar.d Anita outpointed her on
the beat home. The boats which took
part In the race were the following: The
vawl Uulcie of the San Kranciscos. sailed
by W. M. Edg-ell and W. G. Morrow; the
flocp Anita, the yawl Kktiwake. the
slocp Doris, sailed by R. B. Hogue and
G. T. S. White: the sloop Olita and J.
Martola's fishing-boat Pirate.
The ya-rl Dulcie teas doing good work
until she met with a mishap, which put
her out of the race. She had shipped
some writer, and. while her owner was
balling, W. G. Morrow, who was tend
ing the main and jib sheets, as Â¦well as
handling the tiller, lost hold of the main

ER'S poultry* yard and dog
kennel In the rear of her home.
641 Bush street, have caused
. the officers of the California
street police station much worry during
the last week and are likely to bring
about an exodus of guests from the Hotel
Wentworth immediately overlooking their
location. A rooster with a "foghorn"
crow, quackinjr ducks galpre, and two
dogs with weird howls, commence their
barnyard chorus shortly after midnight
and keep it up until the sun is high, in
the sky. No slumber do the hotel guests
get and one lady has already sought a
more peaceable locality. The police have
been appealed to time and again, but all
to no avail. Mrs. Wlnbecker gave the
final chapters to the story by telling the
police of mysterious hands that drop
poisoned wheat, but the police seem over
whelmed with the complaints, pro and
con, and are confused.
The first rooster crowed about two
months ago. Mrs. Winbecker at first
offered to arbitrate and the guests. and
hotel managers were ready purchasers
for her screeching fowl. Others came,
though, and a* fast as the roosters were
gold others replaced them "and the lady
Boon found that the' rooster business oaid
well. The guests claim that they exact
ed a promise from Matilda that she
should keep no more fowl and paid their
good money on those lines. Each time,
however, tne previous owner of the game
replenished her supply and raised the
price. First the roosters sold for Jl 25;
then for $1 50. and now Mrs. Wlnbecker
says they are worth $3. The people who
are disturbed In their Blumbers say, they
would be willing to. pay twice the last
named price If they could only receive a
guarantee that, their troubles would end

PROFESSOR GEORGE MIEH
LING, wrestling Instructor at the
Olympic Club, did business with
a Petaluma farmer some days
ago and what the farmer In turn
did to the professor has not strengthened
the Christian spirit of the latter. Shortly
after the genial Instructor had settled In
Mill Vallev he determined to establish a
full grown hennery. To effect this end he
made a trip to Petaluma for the -purpose
of buying a stock of chickens. He had
been advised that the best breed of fowl
for the Mill Valley climate was the tall
and haughty Langshang.
After careful Inquiry the professor dis
covered a ranch about four ralles from
Petaluma where the Langshang was as
plentiful as blue blooded. Finding that,
to all appearances, the chickens were
what he wanted, he bought two hundred
pullets from the obliging rancher and had
them shipped to Mill, Valley. Upon their
arrival the professor's troubles began. In
the'first place the birds were not adapted
to the brushy valley, as the long feathers
on their legs tangled In the underbrush
and their owner had to. spend two days
singeing the gold plated limbs of his
flock. Â¦'Â¦Â¦": .
Three weeks went by and though Meih
llng fed his new. acquisitions everything
from, cracked wheat Â¦ to pepsin , tablets,'
never a egg was laid. Melhllng called on
his friends. Police Judge C. T. . Conlan
was consulted. He looked the fowls over
; and recommended that Meihllng putthem
Into active training. Thl3 was done. The
chickens were fanned about the yard; up
and down boards and over hurdles, but
no eggs. V'. -... Â¦ HBBS^ftQH

ever,; that an old lady ; neighbor who had
long watched his physical culture antics
In the henyard came to his rescue. She

three hens among -197 roosters." Since
then Meihllnff has known 1 no peace. The

"What political party has upheld the
money standard of this country and fos
tered its industries? The Republican par
ty, all must answer. This great organiza
tion has always been on the right side
in all questions of import."
The speaker stated that Republicanism
had inaugurated anti-Chinese legislation
and had adopted and enforced civil ser
vice. Speaking of trusts he said:
"When on June 1 of this year an
amendment to the constitution was of
fered In Congress regulating trusts and
Illegal corporations 130 of Â»~e Republican
representatives voted for Uie regulation
and two against, while of lSi Democrats
130 cast their ballots against the amend
ment, the latter directly favoring the
trusts that they now rail against.
"There is npthlng new in expansion.
Presidents from Jefferson to Buchanan
have recpmmended it. looking with long-
Ing eyes on Cuba. Three-fourths of the
United States Is territory of expansion.
The paramount question is not shall we
expand, but Fhall we contract, thus aban
doning: our rightful possessions."
"The great claims of the Republican
party are many. Perhaps the brightest
page in its history Is that upon whicn
is written the immortal wprds of the great
Lincoln which knocked the shackles from
the limbs of millions of black men In tha
Southern States of our Union. It was me
Republican party that held tnis Union

education we must consider the useful
ness of the parties. That is where the
power really comes from. Lopking from
the background we do not appreciate their
great force nor can we estimate it any
more than the power pf a Roman cata

The Campaign Issue in 1806.
During the last two years of Cleveland'3
second term the is?ue for the campaign of
1SS6 was made up. That issue was the
Â¦Â¦Â¦The passage of the "Wilson bill was fol
lowed by a revolution in party ascend
ancy almost . as overwhelming as that
which succeeded the enactment of the
Republican law four vears before. The
election of Congress in 1S34 -was made to
turn less positively upon tarlu. questions
than had the preceding election. The Re
publicans attacked the: Wilson bill, but
they did not promise to restore the Mc-
Kinleylaw. The prevailing business de
pression worked strongly in their favor.
For that they charged the resoonsibility
ln a general way upon the Democratic
party and there was the usual popular
tendency to regard the change as due
to unwise methods in the conduct of the
Government. . Â¦ â¢
Moreover. President Cleveland wis
never popular with the rank and file of
his own party. His successes had come
largely because of the strong support
given him by independent Republicans.
It was in part the lack of thorough loy
alty to Ihe President on the part of Dem
ocrats which mart* so easy the Republi
can triumph in 1SD1.
: ."the country, was learning through sad
experience that frequent partisan threats
of revolutionary changes in : . the schedule
of â¢ Imposts were' disastrous-. -to. business.
While mere partisan. debate.upon the sub
ject reacted unfavorably upon the legit
imate Industries of the country. Exagger
ation" for political, effect of the really
.slight differences ,' In Â¦ the policies of the
two parties 'worked in the saxne direction.
'The. watchful business man was led to
expect sweeping changes when no such
chances were, actually contemplated. ..

The Campaign of 1892.
free coinage of the silver dollar by the
United States alone at the ratio., of 1*
to 1. Never has a Presidential election
tnmed upon a clearer issue more sharply,
defined. Such an event does not takd
place as a mere temporary accident. ;Â° Its
causes lie deep in the past. "'."-. .. = 'â¢
: While the civil war was in progres3 ana
for many, years thereafter tne dollar In,
common use was legal tender paper, com
manding less value than the coin of the
same name. Millions of simple, folk un
skilled in financial science entered Into
contracts during this period, s many -. of
which Involved obligations extending over
long terms of years. The idea of chan?3
in the value of money Itself did not enter
into their thought. To them a dollar,
whether of gold or silver, or paper, was
simply a dollar. The prevailing rate of
interest was high, and when the tSmo
rirally came for the payment of the prin
cipal of these debts the dollar had so in
creased In value that the unlucky debtor
was compelled to make a gratuity or
from one to twenty-five per cent in ad
dition to the value pledged In the con
tract. . â . Â¦' *'
So far as the paper dollar alone was
concerned, the difficulty was got over
without serious consequences. On It3
face the paper dollar appeared as a tem
forary expedient to meet an emergency,
t. carried with It a notification of a
prospective return to coin values. The
debtor who inadvertently signed a con
tract calling for dollars worth at the time
ninety: . cents, which a. few years later
forced him to pay the same number o?
dollars each worth 100 cents, could blame
no one but himself. But when specie pay
ments were once more restored the expec
tation was general that the fluctuation In
theivalue of the dollar would cease. That
was-the standard argument by which thÂ«
policy of resumption had been supported.
SoMri 1S79 it was thought that at last a
had been- provided In terms of
which contracts could be drawn and thÂ«
obligations met. even a.fter the lapse of a,
decade,. In â¢': practically the same values.
: clt was } a disappointment to find that,
even after a return to a specie basis, the
dollar continued to increase In value a<*
rapidly as it had during the five vearw
preceding/resumption. Debtors -were still
obliged in the legal settlement of a debt
to pay not only normal interest but ateo
a sratuity to the creditor.
'.'.Â¦Â¦â¢Part of the curse of the civil war lay In
the; fact that political debate upon all sub
jects was habitually east In the mold of
Inordinate sensation and passion. The ob
jection on the part of the debtor class to
settling contracts In appreciated dollars
wa3 In the partisan language of the day
branded as dishonest â as the manifesta
tion of a disposition to commit theft or
robbery. Among the debtors, on the other
hand, there were those who were ready to
believe that the charges in the value of
the dollar were the result of deliberate in
tent to execute continual and perpetual
snollatlon . :upon the producing classes.
This style of political discussion tended tr>
Increase mutual distrust and suspicion.
When creditors accused their debtors of a
purpose to defraud because they favored
a policy for the continued use of the silver
dollar the enlightened debtor honestly be
lieved that the charge was not sincerely
made. Â¦;:'. . : " v ,- ; '.
: Such severity of arraignment, such re
flections upon the motives of opponents,
were to be expected from the lips of po
litical orators in the heat of partisan de
bate, and injuries of that character did
not strike deep. But when eminent editors
of reputable religriou3 newspapers, profes
sors in colleges and universities of high
standing and other leaders of opinion lent
the. influence of their names and positions
to support a form of political discussion
which Involved either conscious hypocrisy
or blank Idiocy, then,' Indeed, the sense of
Injury became deep and of serious por
tent. :Â¦ Â¦ | . .-Â¦.:;â¢Â¦ . .;' ;â¢Â¦. ;,:â¢ ., .
failure of Plan for Bimetallism.
The country became conscious of the
final failure of the International bimetallic
movement ; during the closing years of
Cleveland's Â¦ administration. It was a
movement which had received the sup
port of a large proportion of the leading
economists of Europe. No sliver advocate
In America had used stronger language
descriptive of the evil results of maintain
ing a continually appreciating dollar than
had some of.. the Â¦ sober economists of
â¢world-wide reputation. There was abund
ant and high authority for the belief that
a persistence in th? policy on the part of
the various nations for demonetizing sil
ver and adopting 'Instead a stryrle gold;
standard would create a currency which
would continually Increase In value.
To these reasons for anxiety must bÂ«
added a consideration of the fact that
during the same period in which silver
had been rejected a phenomenal increase
had taken place in public and private in
debtedness, new forms of credit had ap
peared, so that not only a larger amount
but a larger proportion of thÂ» wealth or
the world Â¦was. held under the various
forms of credit. ; . 'Â» '
At a time when citizens had arrived at a
general appreciation of all these facts tfcÂ©
Democratic Convention was held In Chi
cago and the Bryan campaign was In
augurated. It resulted In an. effort to se^.
cure the retention of sliver as standard
money. The new Issue Involved the read
justment of partr allegiance. A conven
tion was 'held !n Indianapolis mainly com
posed, of : Democrats who had remained
faithful to Cleveland. They were the very
Democrats who had been most hostile to
the tariff policy associated with the name
of McKinley. Tet now they used every
endeavor to secure his election to the
Presidency, so great was the importance
which they attached to the defeat of Mr.
Bryan. At the fame time Mr. Bryan was
ardently supported by Republicans in the
silver mining States. JESSE MACT.

Schopplein fired the ehot from the top
of a hill in front of his home on Green
street. Ills victim stood half a block
away and the bullet entered the top of
his head, ranging downward, inflicting a

Animal Frightened at Lumber Pile While
Making Run to a Blazed -
. Engine No. 115 of the San. Francisco Fire Department came near /being
dashed into a lumber pile yesterday afternoon on Sacramento, street,. Just west
of Steiner. One of the horses attached to the engine struck a board Â¦â¢ which
projected "ke a huge pike and was shockingly mangled. Thrown from Its
feet, the poor brute was drawn some distance by: the terrific impetus given to
the engine by a long 'run on a downgrade over a smooth bituminous .pave
ment.' The mlxup that resulted was dangerous' to the . Uyes'/and "limbs of
three men on the engine, but they miraculously, came out ' With vwhole; skins
