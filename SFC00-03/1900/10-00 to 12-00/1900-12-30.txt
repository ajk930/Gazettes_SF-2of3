Bad Boy.
"He told me to go to. thunder with
my doughnuts and cheece." said the old
man, his lip quivering.
"Now we will go into the dining-car
to dinner," said the Bad Bov. and the
old man got up and followed him. "We
will have a feast fit for the jrods."
"Mush and milk is j?ood enough for
me," said the old man. but when they
jgot into the dining-car the old man was
paralyzed by its beauty. The steward of
the car bowed them along w r ith dignity,
and the old man thought he must be the
owner of the road, and he asked the boy
if that was one of the Vanderbilts and
was told that it was Corneal Vander
bilt.
The waiter bowed low. and the old
man, not to be outdone in politeness,
made an old-fashioned courtesy such as
he used' to do at a country dance when
the fiddler shouted "honors to partners,"
and then he put out his hand and shook
the hand of the negro and said he was
pleased to meet him.
"This is my friend. Senator Petti
grew of North Dakota." said the Bad
Boy, introducing the old man to the
waiter, and the old man looked puzzled
but sat down. . .. "Remember, until I
change your name you are Senator Pet
tigrew," and the waiter handed them
bills of fare. . , . . . . .
The old , man looked over the - bill of
fare and said he couldn't find any fried

as good, and he ordered for both. Whe:

know, for the life of him. tvruit they
were g'jiucr far. He knew that his vouncr
: â¢..:..-â¢ rich, and he fell that the
boy was goin'^ to show him a little of
life in a great tit;.-, and he ha<l confi
dence that a!l would turn out right.
But as he sat in the sleeping-car sec
tion, looking at the blue lake so bv. he
wondered whether they would both
bring up in Sir.g Sing or own the
Standard Oil Company before spring.
A lump came into the old man's
thront as he thought of coinji so far
away from home, and he worried a
little as to whether the old customers of
the grocery where he had been so long
a fixture .voul'J get along as well with
his successor as with him.
His shoes hurt his feet, and he took
them oft and rested his feet with the
gray woollen tocks on the seat in front
bf hi::i. and the porter told him he
would have to put on his slipper?, so he
glared rit the porter and opened his tel-
Cbcope valise and got out an old pair cf
carpet rHpner? and put them on and

fore he got to New York
"Now. bub," mid the old man. as the
Bad Boy took off his coat and put on a
smoking jacket and a traveling ca?.
'"what arc we goir.c to New York for?
What part do I play in this drammy, or
tragedy, or whatever it is? I want to
study my part, so I won't have to be
"Well, I'll tell you all I can." said the
boy, taking a book out of his grip.
"We are going to New York for aflven
turc. You are to take any. cart I give
you, to be my father, my uncle, the vic
tim of my schemes, a companion, ad
viser and friend. I may decide to marry
a girl who is the heir to Vanderbilt mil
lions, and if I do you are to cive me
away.
"Hold on. bub. there is one thing I
want understood."' said the old man.
"If you can get in love with a rich girl,
whose mother is a widow and hasn't cot
ar.y husband to take care of. ring me in
on the widow, can't you? I would make
a father-in-law you could be proud of.
I am something of a masher myself
when I am where thcy.don't know me, '
sr.d the old nan tried to look ciddv.
"Oh. you will do." said the Bad Bov.
as he laughed at the old man's con
fession of being a masher in disguise.
"Ill give 3'ou a run for your money in
New York, and you might iust as well
begin mashing that ladv across the aisle
who has 'M. D.' marked on the end of
her suit case. She is probably a female
doctor, s.nd -you may need her services
before morning. You have never trav
eled on "a sleeper before, have vou?"
"Xo. I never saw a sleeper, except to
watch them go by en the trains, and I
don't know how you sleep in 'em. un
less you curl tip on the seats. I 'have
traveled on the cars before, though.
Thirty years ago a lot of us went on an
excursion to Jancsville. to the State
Fair. . I went to Â«O^hkosh once on a
grocers' picnic, and during the World's
Fair I went down to Chicago, but I cot
robbed at the' depot and never went to
the fair st all. Say, I'm getting sort of
empty. Don't you want a sort of lunch?"
and rfie old' man took out of his tele-
Ecope a package done up in a brown
paper. "Come on, we can go. into the
baggage car and sit on a trunk and eat
these doughnuts and cheese."
"Throw them out of the window or
give them to that poor old man down
the car, with the dandruff on his coat
collar," said the boy. "The doughnut
and cheese period has passed with us.
and we will go into the dining-car soon
and cat like the crowned heads."
The old man took his brown paper
package snd went to the old man spoken
of and offered him the lunch, and the
Bad Boy watched the look of indigna
tion on the face of the stranger, and
finally the old groceryman came reeling
back through the fast-movins train with
the package in his hand and a look of
pain on his face.
terest The woman with "M. D." on her
suit case came and sat in the seat with,
the old man while her berth was beins<
made op, and the old man thought ha
ought to say something pleasant, bat
when he said he had iust come frora
eating and asked her if she liked travel
ing the woman got up and moved away.
However, the Bad Boy told him not
to mind, as the woman would undoubt
edly make up to him before they got tf>
New York, and then he gave the oM
man some' directions about how to con
duct himself in a sleepincr-car.
He told him to hide his money some
where in the berth, and if he wanted
anything in the night to rinc the bei!
or pull the bell rope; if anything: was tha
matter with him he could call up thÂ«
female doctor.
And the boy got inside the curtains of
the old man's berth and showed him
hoyv to pack away his clothes, anj
showed him how to wear the new pa
jamas he had bought for his old friend.
At fir3t the old n:an kicked on wear
ing pajamas and wanted to sleep with
his clothes on, but on being told that
they would arrest him if he slept in his
clothes he submitted to the pajamas.
And after he got them on he wanted to
walk up and down the car and show
them, but the Bad Boy cot him to be-J
finally, and in time all were asleep.
It was not long before there was a
commotion about the old man's berth,
and the passengers all looked out and
saw the old man with the neexo porter
down on tHe floor of the car maulinsf
him, and the negro yellinsr for mercy.
The Pad Boy and the conductor toolc
the old man of!, and the bov said:
"Senator, what is the meanine of thia
riot?"
"Well, by gosh," said the old man,
with one of his shoes in each hand. "I
don't propose to be robbed. I put mj
money in my shoe and put it under my
pillow, and this fellow tried to steal the
whole business, but I caught him by thÂ«
neck and just cave him a square hold
and the grapevine lock and I floored
him and got my shoes, and there is the
money, right up in the toe."
"Fore de Lawd, Senator. I never aim
to rob you, noho^y." said the frightened
negro, trying to fix his windpipe that
the old man had squeezed shut. "I just
wanted to shine your shoes."
"Oh, rats," said the old man. as he
put the money in the pocket of his pa
jamas. "I greased my shoes day before
yesterday, and you needn't touch 'em."
The Bad Boy and the conductor cot
the eld man to bed ajrain. and the in
cident was closed, only the old man said
to the boy: "I know I shall kill a coon
before we get to New York. Alwayi
when I am going to commit murder I
dream about it the night before." and
he rolled over and went to sleep.
It was about daylight in the morning
when the Bad Boy was awakened by
another commotion, a female scream
and loud voices, and men seemed to bo
pushing an unwilling person along
toward the smoking-room.
He got up and followed and found thÂ«
old groceryman held by the conductor
and several passengers in the smoklncr
room, and he was protesting that ha
was Senator Pettigrew and meant no
harm to anybody, but he would ba
dumbed if any female could trifle with
him.
"What in the world is the matter.
Senator?" said the Bad Boy, .coming
into the room and telling the men to let
go 'of the old man. "What have you
been doing? Your face is all scratched
and"
"I am innocent, I swear it," said tha
old man, wiping his face on his sleeve.
"You see I et too much supper and
you told me if I was sick in the night
anybody would help me. so I thought of
that female doctor, and I thoucht I
would ask her for some medicine. So t
just opened the lambrequins in front o|
her stall and just touched her on the
shoulders and shook her a little to wake
her up and when she sort of raised up
in bed and looked wild I said to her,
says I, 'Doc, I have cot the worst casa
of colic you ever run up agin in all your
practice, and I wish you would give ma
a dose of pain killer or something.' Ju:t
like that J. said it, as polite as yoa
please..
."Say, that must be the iron-tawed]
woman in a circus instead of a doctor.
* : She grabbed me by the hair and
bumped my head against the upper
berth and cuffed me and yelled and fi*
and squawled. and these gentlemen cams
along and rescued me and took me of!
in here. But, by gosh, she cured my
colic, sure as you're born." and the old
man tried to look happy.
Â¦ "Who is this old cuss?" said the con
ductor, turning to the Bad Bov. "Yoa
seem to have him in charce."
"Gentlemen, I beg your pardon, and I
\rill apologize to the lady." said the Bad
Boy, wiping his eyes, as though weep
ing. "This man is my father. I am tak
ing, him to a sanitarium in the East,
where I hope the best treatment that
money can procure will restore him to
his bereaved family. His mind is im
paired from overwork handling" his mil
lions. He thinks he 13 Senator Petti
grew, and I humor him in the idea.
Let me put him to bed and I will be re
sponsible for him. Have pitv on %
poor, insane old man, I besr o! you."
The conductor and the passengers'
turned the old man over to the bov, ami
he took him back to his berth and whis
pered to him:
"Now, 1 have saved you from the
mob, but remember "you are mildly in

2THE outlook for the ship-building In
dustry of California during the next
century Is most promising. Tho
future promises even more than tha
immediate past, which ha* been a period,
o* extraordinary activity. Naturally a
greater supply^ will main, a proportion
ately larger demandâ an increase in trado
aiul conmitrce. The only way ta substan
tiate this prediction is to reason fr^m
"What has California done for tho Amer
ican navy'.' She has set the typo of ifcipa,
in nuality, workmanship and speoj, ami
in their ability to periorm coiitinaouiiy
what they v.-ere designed to do. Sue ha_i
demonstrated that tills sldÂ» or the conti
nent is able to assist the> Central Govern
ment in cieÂ£eruii::;i Ua coast; that the Cen
tral Government is .va-itly benefited by
the development of tho resources of this
section of the country, and, furthermore,
that U can recruit ships with men irom
the ranches and the lumber districts who
have the requisites oC good fighters
equally with men torn anywhere elae on
t.io soil Qf America. Prior to thÂ» time
of the Charleston only passenger ships
and colliers were built on the Pacino
slope. The cruiser Charleston was built
en Knglish plans bought from the Arm
strong by n'niiam c. Whitney. It was
tiie nrst of the new ships ordered, uncier
tne Cleveland administration to be com
pleted and put into commission.
The second Cailfornia-built war vessel

was followed by the Monterey.- a ttoubie
turreted monitor maJi.i:iÂ£ fourteen knots,
a very great advance, regarding speed, on
any monitor previously buiit. It was tha
tirst monitor to successfully croaa a great
ocean, going from San Francisco to 'Â«Ia
nila, over 7u0u miles, without any trouble.
Next in order came the Olyra^ia, whusj
speed was phenomenal, her official record
b' ing one and three-quarter knou faster
than the requirement. She was very
nearly as fast us tho Columbia or tho

California's next triumph was in the
Oreson, a Lattlej>hlp-Df exactly the saraa
tvpt a-i the liidiana and Massachusetts.
The three were desisrncd and ordered at
the sauna timo and were all to make fif
teen knots. The Indiana ma.Ie fifteen and
a snip 11 fraction, the Massachusetts six
teen and a small fraction, the Oregon
17 ;y knot?. The Oregon's famous run
froii San Franruco to Santiago de Cuba
is historical, rihe was in perfect order'
v:hen she got there, went into the r.gh^
a~'d her performance was conspicuous
above that of any battleship ensragtd,
due to the fighting Qualities of Captain
' Charles Clark and the* skill of Chief en
gineer MffiUgan: After the war the Ore

After tho Ort-tron. the gunboats Wheel
ing and Marietta were launched here.
Toe Marietta made this trip without any
r.-eak.lo-.vn. and tiid as well the work she
was destined to as any of the bi? battle
ships dirt the work of their class. She
was dubbed the ftull Calf by Rear Ad

mnre ordered at the same time and from
th" same plans as the Alabama and the
Illinois. The Wisconsin holds the record
for battleships of her class in the Ameri
can navy to-Â«lny.
Vrom the foregoing It will be seen that
the ?hip3 built in SaÂ» Francl3co are su
perior in every respect to those built oa
the Atlantic coast, and for the plain rea
son that the building of battleships for
the Government has attained a better de
velopment in San Francisco than in any
other part of the United Stateg.
Less than a score of years have passed
since the first merchant ship was con
structed at the Uniori Iron Works. It was
the collier Arapo. and the Â«-eeond vessel
was the passenger steamer Pomona. Tha
demands of the merchant marine- aug
mented California's shipbuilding enter
prise. The Senator anfl the St. Paul were
next vrrdtled to the wave here and both
were chartered -by the Government as
transports for the a: my service on tha
Manila route. The f'ei~ht ship Callfor
nian is the largest rhlp built for tho mer
chant marine on the Pacific Coast, having
ll.SCO tons,, displacement. : The Alaskan
and Arizonian are each 18.500 tons dis
placement, and these will be the largest
freight steamships built in America up
to date. The ferryboat Berkeley is the
largest double-ended Â¦ ferryboat on tha
Western coast, operated by a single screw
at each end and having a seating capacity
of 1700 people. These with numerous other
craft â tugs, yachts and small boats â
prove the substatlal establishment of tha
ship-buiVilng- industry on the bay of SÂ«j>

disasters, the Red Cross can give assist
ance at once.
The Spanish war has proven to the pub
lic the efficiency of the Red Cross. In
event of any similar occurrence the con
fidence of the people need, not be won.
That has already been done, and this
point argues well for the future of the
society.
As for our own State Red Cross, praises
of its work have been sung far and wide.
Congress in its next report will officially
say that no other State in the Union has
done such magnificent work.
On April 23, 1SS8, a number of people met
here in San Francisco and banded them
selves -together in an unofficial society,
which quietly developed into a State Red
Cross Society, funds to the amount of
$1SO,OCO being subscribedÂ»by the enthusias
tic and generous public. V.'ithin three
v."eeks after organization we had nur.=es
in the fieldâ the first sent o.ut in the
Union.
There Is no need of groins' Into the do
tails of the work of the California Red
Cross. It Is too fresh in tho minds or
all to need recounting. Our organization
had to draw up its own constitution and
it proved so complete that the National
Red Cross has not interfered with it.
Many other States have sent for our con
stitution and have adopted it; each State,
of course, being under the National Red
Cross.
"While the interest in, the Red Cross
somewhat abated after the war, the Gal
v'eston flood showed the public the neÂ«?d
for its continuance in time of peace as
well as war.
The history of the Red Cross of this
State is a red-letter page in National Red
Cross. I am sure the future will not dim
its prestige. #
NEVER â¢ in I the history of the Red
Cross has the outlook been so prom
ising. The work done by the Red
Cress In the past, helpful and hu
manitarian as It has teen, will not com
pare n-ith that of thefuturei For to-day
the .society stands en a substantial anl
systematic basis. Its work has been rec
ognized by the Government; its aims an:3
labors have b^en firmly outlined.
Just within the fist few racntiis the Na
tional Red Cross has been thus recon
structed to meet the growing demands.
Every State in the, Union has now its
Red Cross, and the mother society had to
loo]: to the growth, t welf. ire arid harmony
of thoÂ£e childrun, and help them to make
the most of their, possibilities for useful
ntÂ»f s.
This ofilciaf standing of the Red Cross
mfa:;3 a great deal. There can no longer
be any question of its overstepping its
boundaries. Nor is there now any doubt
as to "whether the White or Hod Cro=s
has official reccgr.ltienâ Congress hm
placed its seal on the r.cd Cross.
With this official backbone the Red
Cross cannot help but take great strides
in the future.. The noble and capable
Clara Barton still stands at the helm and
harmony is 'the keynote nf the organiza
tion, which men ns mUch for its efficiency.
In the past the Red Cross ha* had to
depend upon spasmodic contributions giv
en in thi.* heat ot some 'great disaster.
Though the generous public quickly
opened its purscstrings, still it mer.nt Jo
lay, and urgent case;; suffered. Now it
is purposed to havo enough funds in the
treasury to meet any immediate demand.
For instance, in the Galveston flood the
Red Cross was hampered and delayed by
thirt deficiency. Every effort will be mad%
to have enough fands on hand so that in

Nature has had some reasons for the

skeleton of her greatest triumphâ man â
and it will not be well to advocate in the
twentieth century t'ie "preventive sur

learn prudence from our successes, and we

THE FUTURE
OF
MEDICINE
By F. W, D' Evelyn, M.D.
HISTORY has demonstrated that
there have : been noted periods in
which growt h and development in
ark*, sciences and economics have
â¢ bf en most T>ronou;iced. yet there haÂ« not
boen any discovery of fixed laws by which
we could formulate "causes" for this
activity; or v.hich would enable us to con
clude that this growth' and development
for any given pe/iod would be constant
and uniform. "Were' it otherwise the fu
ture would be simply a proportionate de
velopment of the present, and would-ad
mit of no difficulty in fully appreciating
itÂ« completeness.
Hence to conclude that the marked
strides made In the art and scionco of
modicino in the past one hundred yt-ars
would he relatively pustnined in the suc
ceeding century is at best simply, a mat
ter of conjecture. Yet we are prepared to
anticipate great things, for we cannot
think that the next cycle of years will so
degenerate the active faculties of medi
cine that there will not be born to It minds
as advanced in comparison with the pre^->
ent typo as the present type is in advance
of the "mastery" Â¦' whose genius was only
a lesser darkness, than the surrounding
gloom of ignorance which shrouded the
medical world a century ago.
V. r e must admit* that we are indebted
to those who have gone before us, and
that much which we claim to-day as orig
inal is. in very truth simply thfi elucida
tion of a fact !ong since suggested, or an
unexplained observation long since made.
" Let us note that 1S0O years ago Pompeii
was destroyed, but many of the surgical
instruments discovered in those ruins are
in principle essentially the same as those

by the "inventor,"' electroplated and
safely protected in the grip which bears
the orcud name of a modern Galen or
Hellodorus.
Again, might not good old Jamea Mo-
Iins, who somewhere about the year 1730
was appointed "surgeon for stone," he
considered worthy of dignity of a special

urinary surgeon" who^e trips to Europe
perennially add f rtsh . arms of precision to
the lengthy list of "ore-crusherr; and ex
tractors," and also some new "tips" in
the application of hydraulics and illumin
ants.
Do we not even find recorded as "new

nature convince thos-e of iig who" h-ive
studied the subject deeply that a large
proportion of the "novelties" in recent
mc'Mcine are moroly novel in application
and not In discovery.

the last fcntur>\ moreiespjjglally (hiring

phenomenal. These results are One to
many! col lateral factors, such aÂ« tlie in
troduction of general '.and local anes

precautions and surroundings, while thÂ«i
surgeon himself has had opportunities for
study and manipulation altogether boyond
the reach of^his predecessor. The interest
resulting fro'm theifl combinations has be
come inflammatory, and it is impossible
not to recognize that operative surgery
has a strong "upward tendency," and
with this Lhere Is much danger that this
branch of medicine Â¦ will be overworked.
\There is in the human mind a 'fetich-Hiso

is broken only by ' the .weird: monotone of
the assistants' hushed voices, is not the
effect tragical? And the" layman would

well merited, justifiable, scientific and es

THE SUNDAY OAX1I1.
By David Starr Jordan.
THE movement of education in Amer
ica in the past half century is such
that we can speak with some cer
tJiiniy as to its future trend. ""In my
3u<2*rm**nt, this will be for the next fifty
yczl* in the direction of constructive in
dividualism. Greater efforts will be made
to Ilnd out what the individual is good
for and to adapt the course of study to
â¢wnrd making the mo?t of his powers. To
this end there will be greatiy extended
opportunities for specialization, with a
grreajer <fr.jrt ( O bring the student into
that tine of i-iiecialization in which he will
prove nir-st effective. At the same time
there will be constantly widening oppor
tunities for genera! culture, but this cul
turo will bo likewise adapted to the Indi
vidual, taking into the fullest account the
different pov.Â«rs and needs of- different
men. Too much emphasis cannot be laid
ton the necessity for a broad general traln
lr.g as a preparation for successful spe
daJ training, but for this training those
â¢subject* must bÂ« chosen which will se
cure the desired rtyult in the Individual
case. It Is not mankind which 1b to be
trained, but the Individual man. Borne
men attain culture* through the study of
the noble monuments of the literature of
â¢AtlQulty. Otners find nothing In Greek
but tedious drudgery. Some acquire gen
uine culture from the study of modern
historical movements, others from the
contemplation of phs'sicai law or from
the relation of life to its surroundings,
whatever strengthens or clarifies the
innd, whatever broadens the horizon of
visior. or intensifies one's interest in high
er miners is a source of culture. Culture
is not the result of any study or combi
nation of studies, it is concerned with
one b attitude toward nature and human
lt Â£ > . and the re is no single gate through
which all may pass to attain it.
The growing realization of the vaJue of
expert knowledge, itself one of the best
tests of the existence of general culture,
will demand of the American university
constantly greater thoroughness in Its
work. Thoroughness requires costly ap
pliances, the best of teachers, the best
of libraries, the best of apparatus Espe
cially is this true in the study of 'the ap
plied sciences. For example, the subject
of electricity alone demands for effective
instruction a costlier plant than was
needed for a great college of the classical
stamp In the last generation. -
The American university of the future
must be wealthy, for it must have meant*
to meet the needs of a very large variety
of men and women. It must be large, for
when It meets these needs students will
come to It In numbers. It must be poor
in the best sense, because it can keep no
idle capital. In its efforts to meet the just
demands upon it it will strain to the ut
most all its resources. The universities
of England have stood In. tho past for
personal culture. The universities of Ger
many have stood for thoroughness of
knowledge. The universities of America,
under the impulse of the virility of en
lightened democracy, have tried to com
bine these two Ideals Into a third, that of
personal effectiveness. What can you do?
is the question every American : student
has to answer. The university should en
able him to answer It ~ well. : . And* with
their present rate of growth in usefulness
and power, there seems no reason why in
fifty years the leading schools in higher
education and specialized training should
not be on American soil. In any, event,
the^future of the American republic must
lie" with the American university. In its
hands the future is safe. The change in
the Harvard of 1S50 to that of 1900 suffi
ciently forecasts the coming change to
the Harvard of 1950. for the same In
fluences that have found response in the
wise administration of President Eliot
â¢will remain at work for the generations
to come. ' r *mBB
In my Judgment the same line of growth
will be followed In the great State univer-

sities as In those of private foundation.
The latter are freer to move, better fitted
for educational experiments. The State
university is in closer touch with the peo
ple and will carry the people with it. The
denominational institutions will become
distinctly rpccialized as such, emphasiz
ing general culture with religious train
ing. They may become feeders to higher
institutions, or else, where their endow
ment permits, they will develop into uni
versities of the same general type as the
others. To become a living university is
to recognize the movement of the times
and to respond to it.
The position of the preparatory school
will become more worthy as it is more
definitely lixed. A good academy is far
more useful than a weak college. Tho
preparatory school will fill the space be
tween childhood and the beginning of
specialization. The student who leaves its
doors will look directly toward life, no
matter how Ions the vista of training
v.hich lies between. And with the growth
of real universities all other schools /will
foel the stimulus of their activity. Better
methods will yield better men. The in
fluence of the university wHl be felt more
and more through the whole school sys
tem. It will return from the student w"ho
f cpp on to the university. It will follow
the university student who goes back to
the academy ns a teacher, and this mu
tual Influence for pood mupt grow greater
n-s the years go on. So long as "America

Mr?. Ward says: "When we read some of

In conclusion Mrs. Ward shows the
great influenco. of Ruskin, not only in the
field of art, but in religionâ as he taught
mrn the spirit and not the form and made
them realize that "no man liveth to hlm

answer: "Dear Ruskinâ Next time I meet
you I shell knock you down; hut I hope

Mrs. Ward in l;cr forcible way brings
out the man and the one idea that he lived
forâ to i!nd the truth and live up to it.

Mr<=. Ward calls to mind the terrible

the manuscript to Mrs. Taylor, who, after
sitting up all night reading it, left it on

used it to kindle the fire. After Mill had

With al! the aquatic facilities offered
the athlete In and around San Francisco
it is to be lamented that no greater use
baa been made of then. Yachting, row
ing and swimming should bo leading
'pcrt3 en this coast. While rowing and
swimming have a fair following yachting
is practically confined to two active clubs.
This means % that competition In yachting
circles is limited. There Is no place In
the country that Is more adapted for tha
saiHrg of comparatively smaH craft than
the Can Francisco Fay. Yachtlns as a
recreation has a great number of de
votees; as a snort where ractng is tha

thH has seeemingly passed away and It
will take another generation to produco
anything like a proportionate Interest In
yachting |uch as exists In New York and
rther favorably situated Eastern cities.
The clientele of yachting on this coast
and particularly on San Francisco Bay
is the young commercial or professional
man who goes to his c'.ub. the Corinthian

THE FUTURE OF SPORT IN CALIFORNIA
THE SUNDAY CALL.
5coma forward to support his theory,' and
paleontology and embryology have con
firmed the principle laid down by Darwin.
Electrical science was in Its infancy,
with little more than the existence of elec
tric force recognized, when Michael
Faradav (1791-1867) was discovered by Sir
Humphry. Davy binding books. The se
crets of voltaic and magnetic induction,
yielded to Faraday's experiments, and
electrolysis, the wonderful chemical ac
tion of the electric current, followed.
He was tho pathfinder In practical elec
tricity, the one man to whom the applica
tion of electricity to practical purposes is
dua. What this means needs but a glance
about us to understand.
The spread of scientific knowledge
among the people has risen to great
heights chiefly through the influence of
Thomas Huxlev (1S25-1895). Like Dar
win, ho began work on one of the vessels
sent out by the, British Government, and
it. was after the publication of "The Ori
gin of Species" that he began his life task
of convincing the people of the tiÂ»uth of
evolution. ;â¢">
zon in all his power. Trained In diplo
macy in St. Petersburg and Paris, hÂ© re
turned to become President of the Cabinet
and to close a parliament which would not
vota the money for the reorganizing of the
army. Ho accomplished his purposes re
lentlessly, humiliating Austria in 1366 and
taking- Alsace-Lorraine from France in
1S70. Â¦*
Tho unity of Germany is his achieve
ment, and the reform of the coinage, codi
fication of the laws, nationalization of the
railroads and introduction of a. pro
tective tariff were but means to this end.
The power that he wielded was more au
tocratic than that of any monarch, but It
drew its warrant from the strength of hla
personality alone.
In constructive statesmanship Benia
mln Disraeli (1SO4-1SS1) came nearest In
achievement tÂ» Bismarck, though his
method was altogether different. It is to
him that Victoria owes her title of Em
press of India (1876), and to him was the
passage of the reform bill (1S67) largely
due. :
If ho had to achieve by Indirect methods
what Bismarck did by force It was due to
the leader of the Irish home rule partj
In 1SSO.
It was with him that Gladstone, in ISSfl
formed the parliamentary allianca on th(
home rule bill, which secured the supnor
of all the Irish members, but caused ;
split in the Liberal party and restore*
Lord Salisbury to power.
The great representative of France li
this department was Louis Adclnht
Thiers (I7r.7-1ST7>. He witnessed numer
ous changes during the perturbations 01
the age, and: himself served m ifinÂ«Â«fi>Â« oi
foremost as a novelist, that of Nathaniel
Hawthorne (1S04-1SGO. Covering the new
field of Puritanism, he gave tho world the
classic "Scarlet Letter," as well as the no
less delightful "House pf Seven Gables,"
with all its poetic power. The head of the
American Apollo did not belie its owner.
England recognized American literature
ao a force to be reckoned with first from
the works of Hawthorne.
Henrv Wads-worth Lonefellow (1S07-
I-SS2) is the most popular of America's
poets. It Is true that he transferred the
romanticism of the early part of the cen
tury from Europe to the 'Western Conti
nent,* but th*>re was an originality in his
method which made the old ideas new on
new soil. "Hiawatha" is the preat epic of
the departing Indian; "Evangeline"
epitome of the romance of the new Aca
dia, and "The Courtship of Miles Stan
dish" the tuneful romance of stern Puri
tanism. His shorter poems are favorites
with many of the people who seek the
simply beautiful and melodious. t
The chief man of letters of the new
world was James Russell Lowell, even
though there is no one supremely great
production from his pen. "The Biglow
Papers" were a historic force, and the
keen criticism of his numerou3 essays
made for the best appreciation of the no
blest in literature. ; -â¢
As the well rounded literary character
who could write lyric, epic or satirical
poems, trenchant critical essays and 'state
papers of weight and worth with equal
facility and finish, Lowell stands forth as
the best expression of manhood that tho
American literary word has known.
By rÂ«n and voice he fought for and with
Darwin, arousing antagonism especially
by his position toward orthodoxy. He
was the inventor of the much-abused
term agnosticism, helping largely In the
modern movement which has made It im
possible to blame people for doubt.
The mo'st popular and widely known
representative of the host of men engaged
upon the study of bacteria and the pre
vention of disease by special inoculation la
Louis Pasteur (1S22-1S9Q. Ho solved
many chemical problems in early life and
by 1S5S had given his name to a method
of removing the harmful bacteria from
water by special filtration.
He is regarded chiefly, however, for tha
success with which his Inoculation for the
cure of hydrophobia has met. since 1SS4.
The century has seen soma great
changes in methods of government and in

whose majestic sweep of mind the chaotic
conceptions of the world were reduced to
cne beautiful and harmonious cosmos.
His visit to America (in. 17D0-93) has
rightly been termed the second discovery
of the New World. By the spread of hia
noble conception of the harmonious whole

revolutionary work which was to follow.
Charles Darwin (1809-1SS2) was the man
who gave the century its characteristic
theory and tho principle which underlay
it. The young naturalist, who had been,

In no century has literary production
l>een so jrreat or risen so high as in this,
wherefore let us consider first: . .
MEN OF LETTERS.-The supreme per
sonality of the century in the world of
letters is Wolfeaner von Goethe. (1749
1S22). the German Shakespeare, the most
universal mind that the world has ever
produced. Writing poems in V.is child

the fields of human interest in later years.
Ms work was stamped as classical while
in the course nt its productionâ an .un
paralleled achievement, especially, in this
ege of literary product iveness.
It. was because he found inspiration in
the classics of Greek art and literature
thru Goethe achieved such splendid re
sults. The IjO volumes of his works tell
th<? tale of his genius most eloquently, and
"Fau?t," the masterpiece and epitome of
his highest endeavor, will long stand as
the marvel of poetic and philosophic
thought.

literary sea, was Sir Walter Scott (1771
1S22). His was the purpose of celebrating
the glories of bravery, chivalry, pride and
courage, as rev-paled In the historic rec
ords of Scotland and England.
His Waverley novels attracted the atten
tion not only of the English-speaking
world, but of all Europe besides, giving
rise to the school of historical romance,
with all its faults and few virtues. His
"Ivanhoe" # will always be loved by the
youthful enthusiast; his "Bride of Lara
mermoor" â¢will appeal to the sympathies
of generations. The ring of his poems,
too, will hold many youthful hearts, too
fresh for criticism.
But the supreme novelist of the century,
in the estimation of the best critics, is

PHILOSOPHERS.-The original mind of
Geore Wilhelm Friedrich Hcsel (1770
1S31) succeeded in creating a system of
philosophy of tremendoua comprehensive
ness, achieving wide acceptance. To him
consciousness was the essential of thu
world, the ground and goal of all things.
He traced this principle through al! the
sciences to prove its perfect applicability,
producing the "Phenomenology," "Logic"
and "Encyclopedia of Philosophic Sci
ences." The wonderful grasp of his mind
and far spreading effect of his principle
appealed to many thinkers the world over.
His direct opposite in theory and meth
ou was John Stuart Mill (1S06-1S73), tho
great exponent of modern utilitarianism.
He is the author of the theory of the
"happiness of the" majority," or the
"greatest good to the greatest number,"
as the test of the morally good.
His logic is so. thorough a piece of work

"Cavalry Charge" or the. historic "1S07,"
there are the same skillful drawing in
comparable coloring, fire and touch.
The Spanish painter. Mariano Fortunv
(1822-luM)* has special claims upon the ap
preciation of the art lover, because of his
originality, exquisite grace in posing his
figures and the true, natural and spiritual
touch with which his work is done. His
finish is almost like that of Meissonier,
his inspiration has been compared to that
of Goya. * <-Ai'z\,t
. "Tho Choice of the Model" is perhaps
his best known work, though he is equally
effective .in countless canvases, ranging
from "The Carpet Merchant at Morocco"'
to "The Serpent Charmer."
The representative sculptor of our time
is probably Albert Bertsl Thorwaldsen
(1770-1S44). In his work is a feeling for
beauty that is aimost Greek in its dass
kity, yet so human that it appeals to the
most careless observer and takes home
the message of harmony that he would
convey. "The Seascns," "Hehe," "Anipr"
and "Psyche" arc among the best and

M. B. Depny of Indianapolis has in
vented a pwicessj," after thirty-two years
of study und experiments, that will, if
hfs hopes are realized, revolutionize the
manufacture of steel. With the new pro
cess, the inventor says, any piece of steel
may have its tensile strength increased
from 40 to 73 per cent. It can be -made
so hard that no tool will scratch It, and
only a diamond can be used to cut it.
Yet it "cannot be cracked or broken Â£y
impact. The harder the steel Is made
the greater its tensile strength becomes.
Railroad men. say 'that, according to hla
representations. Depoy has discovered tha
very thing that railroads have bee.j
searching: for in vain for years â a process
by which steel rails can be hardened to
resist the wear and tear of heavy trsiin*
without becoming 1 ao brittle as to crack
easily. Every opportunity will be given
him to make practical tests of his process
and he will be aided by tho railroads in
his experiments.
. A piece of cast Iron, Mr. Depoy say*,
may be welded as easily and securely af
ter treatment in his Solution as the best
Norway or Sweden wrought Iron, and any
tool formed from- cast iron by ?hÂ«> regular
casting process may be tempered so that
it will carry an edge superior to the ste<Â»l
now manufactured by the best know.i
processes. This mean?, he says, that
tools that must have the keenest edga
and the greatest tensile ' strength can ba
manufactured after having been cast from
the cheapest iron on the market.
One of . Mr. Depoy's experiments was
the manufacture of a razor from ..a '-wire
rail of the twenty-penny size. It wan
first made into knife "form. -ground "'and
ithen tempered, and it hfts be>.n H>ed in

"Good-night again," in a muffled voice

noticed that the light no longer shone

Turning out the light that swung from
the rafters, he climbed, only half-un
dressed, into his bunk, and presently

CHAPTER XXXI.
"THE PHILOSOPHY OF CLOTHES."
Nothing like occupation to relieve the
pangs of a great sorrow..
Fresh. though her wounds, it seemed to
Zella ages since Mr. Storey struck her
down with the news of hÂ«-' lover's death
Masquerading as Philip Grey, she hadbe
pun to take on a' new Identity. There were
times when she felt, that she was no,'long
er Zella Brunnen: and: times when she felt
her own personality so ; keenly that she
would blush with shame. Her fortitude
had been tried most when she had to as
sociate with men whose . coarse- .humor
found its chief point in the easy assailabll-
Ity of women's virtue. Her girlish recol
lections-of camp life on-the Indian fron-
tier comprehended the anecdotage phase
of the soldier's career; but soldiers'
stories were of fighting and hair-breadth
escapes, grim reminiscences of campaign-""
ing. The ribald eide of a man's life was
new to her and made her sick at heart.'
Once in a Way her mental sufferings
were appeased by the manful protest of
some. strong, fellow, who was too much In
love with .some" g-ood woman to endure
any scoffing at the sex. A San Francisco
man won her admiration with a stinging
remark: "Boys, you. seem to forget you
ever had a mother," which Zella had sup
ported with. "Stranser. I thank . you; . I
remember my mother." "And, by gosh,
it's a pity thit you didn't bring her
along!" retorted the ribald-monger Noth
ing abashed. Zella had replied that she
would be sorry for any woman to be with
in hail of such company, let alone being
in it. "And damme, if the youngster, isn't
right!" the Californlan had rejoined. Zella
had, however, done her best, as the con
troversy became hot, to cool it down, and
had succfcded, with the pleasant penalty
of standing drinks.
Zella, in the chamber that had been oc
cupied by her lover at Prudents Gulch,
awoke with a vague sense- of illusion; a
feeling- akin to that which the evolutionist
is suppoFod to experience r.s the soui sep
arated from its earthly body. Where was
she? What was she? Who was she? But
her recovery was rapid. She came out of
her dream almeet immediately; her senses
acute, her memory alive and her eon
sciousnes.^ wide awake. She listened.
There v/as a movement in the next rootn.
That would be old Solomon setting up. A
dog barked. That was Jim. Somebody
f?aid .".Kine rr.oriiin 1 , guv'nor." That would
be the lad, Dave.
She slipped from her bunk, and drew the
cotton curtain partly irom the'tmall win
dow. The light streamed in. She climbed
back Into her berth. Anyone could 3&e
in at the window surely. She slid to tho
lloor, and examined the window. No;
no one could see in without standing 0:1
a barrel, or hauling on to the window
frame.. She would alter the blind: but,
at the same time, she made a note in her
memory never to forget that she migrht
be observed. She lay still, and contem
plated the room.
Strange, that two rooms of Glover's
should have been left undisturbed, out of
mere sentiment; the one at Parkside, and
this other, away in ihe wilds of Colo
rado.
The walls were nf rough timber, with
big nails for hansM-p cloinre, and a rack
or two for other things. On one side of
the room hung Nod's mining rig, his cap
and his hat; on another a blue serge suit
and a broad felt hat. Close by v was a
lack or shelf, with several volumes of
books; some old newspapers crammed on
the top. In el corner was a large, heavv
looking chest; by its side several pairs of
boots; above It a sun rack, carrying a
double-barreled shotgun and a ritie. A
revolver and a brace ol knives were hang
ing or. hooks. By the doorslde fit the
room there was a rough drop-board, with
a email looking glass and sundry simple
toilet things, a comb and a pair of
brushes, shaving utensils, and a wicker
eau-de-Cologne bottle. Close to her berth
there hung her own photograph, wlth>
such a happy expression on the youthful
face that she paled while looking at it,
and felt the tears rush lrto her eye*.
? â¢ â¢ But this would never do! "She
must suppress all womanly emotions. Tt
seemed to her that she had done noth
ing but cry, ?n a furtive way, .ever since
she had entered old Solomon's hospitable

must be no more whimpering^ no more re
membering that she waa Zella Brunnen;%
except to fortify her S'.iul for Its mission,
her hand and her eyes* for the work that
was before her, as Phuip Grey.
She listened again. Salomon was wash
ing outside the cabin. She looked 'round
the room. There were no arrangements
for washing.
"Don't you go for to disturb Mister
Grey." she heard Solomon say. between,
his splashin.us of the water; "the young
ster needs all the s!eo|> he kin git."
"I lain't goin' to disturb him. guv'ner.
and he don't moan ter let yer. He's just
barricaded hisself in."
"P'raps he thinks we're bandit?," said
Dankes. splashing an unusual quantity of
water about; *
"Shouldn't wonder," said Dave. "He's
gotten one of the pre'.tiest weppins you
ever see."
"Have he? What sort of a weppln?
"A sun; rm-v.-t be a ladies' gun. ef ladies
dees have guriF."
"Mowt it now; so big?"
"No. so little; ana tucked inter h!s
breeches as if ho wornted to hide it."
. -"You've taken .stock of him. Dave?"
"You bet! I never see such a jay this
side Carson."
"Don't think much of him, eh, Dave?"
"There yer wrong, guv'ner; I think a
mfghty'lot of him. He's got a kind of
smile on him that's like you feel w.ith the
first light of spring."
"Have he, now, said Dankes. "I never
know'd asâ er "
The rest, of fhe remark was smothered
In swishes of water and grufttings un
.translatable.
"Them city Jays has a. way with 'em
that's thin, but this feller ain't no durned
pride: might be a 'young millionaire from
'Frisco; and yet he might be a dude, and
if he was a dude, it mowt be one of them
as you gets to like, if you ever does like
dudes; but ef you ever did. them comic
papers 'ud settle yer. I dunno what ter
make of him."
"Don't let us try to make nawthin'
of him," said Dankes, presently, during
a short wait in his operations at the tub
"We'll just sea what he makes of hisself."
Solomon way indulging in an unusually
careful toilette, washing himself, to be
gin with, almost ail over, a function of
cleanliness that he had but little observ
ed since poor Ned Glover was buried.
Presently, when he had finished his
ablutions, and Zella heard him dressing,
she left her bunk, put on her flannel
shirt, and strapped her belt loosely about
her waist. The modern women's fashion
of the blouse helped Zella's disguise. She
pulled her shirt above her belt and undid
tbe collar; -It was the modern blouse, and
at the same time the man's shirt.
Opening her door just sufficiently to see
Dankes, breeched and almost lit to re
ceive company, she sallied into the open
with a cheery, "Good morning, Mr.
Dankes," tucked up her shirtsleeves and
washed.
Then, standin' before Ned's glass, she
felt as -If he might be looking over her
shoulder. She did not dare to use his
comb and brush. Yet she had worn his
clothes. She picked up her loose coat.'
that was lying across her trunk, and took
from the inside pocket a small case con
taining the humblest kind of brush, v and
smoothed her closely cropped hair. She
tied loosely around her .throat a colored
neckerchief, pulled on her Jacket â¢ and
looked at herself. She thought her eyes
had a dull, tired expression, that her face
was too pale; but she felt strong and
well rested.
"How did yer sleep,- mister?" asked
Dankes.
"Like a top."
"That's good. Dave's made the coffee,
and gone off after that mule, then's he
to the millâ we're crushing" some stuff
to-day. What'U you do?".
"Have some breakfast," said Philip
with a laugh. "Ain't that the first part
of the day's programme?"
"1 guess so," said Solomon Dankes.
"Fall to and help yourself. Liberty Hall,
you know, as my dear pard would ha" put
it."
Dankes poured, out the coffee as he
epoke. and Philip, his smile changing
somewhat pathetically at the mention of
Ned, proceeded to attack the cold beef
and ham and bread. -
"Reckon you'll want ter hang round a
spell before goin' down to the valley?'.' .;â¢
"Think that a good Idea?"
"P'r'aps you mowt like to unstrap your
baggage?"
"And take things easy?" each answer
ing the other's question with another.
"Depends: what I'm going to do."
"How do yer mean?"
"Where I'm going to fix myself." .
"Whar did yer thenk of fixing yerself?"
â¢ "There ain't no hotel. I guess, nor" any
sort of boai ding-house?"
"What, heÂ»e at -the -Gulch?".
"Or in. the Valley?-' ;Â¦
"Nary a one," nain Dankes; "but â¢!-.
â¢guesi; you'll; just" lodge here."
: "I may be staying some. time." -
Â¦ "The longer you stays, themore you'll
be welcome. '' .
"Well, now, that's very, kind of you,
but I didn't reckon ;to come here and be a
burden on-you."
"How do you mean a burden, mister?"
'.'I'd like to pay my own'. way, don't you
see. I guess that's fair and square."
"Maybe it is. maybe.it ain't; that's ac
cordin' as a feller takes it, but ef; there
ain't no solid objection,' we'll talk on that
'ed' later," said Dankos. Â¦ / "Ef you ain't :
too'proud to .be my guest .for a- while,
why, I'd take it-kind of you. I'm a lone
ole bummer since I lost my pard."
"Jam not proud, Mr. Dankes." Â¦
""That's a settled thing,, then. Ef you
feel as you wants ter come down ter the
.Valley, why, just you 1 come;, ef. you feel
â¢ as you'd like ter hang around the Gulch

"That's so. But It's different when you

"No doubt," said Zella; and here th!a

: Having -relocked the trunk and dragged
it into the furthermost corner of the
room she undid her. male traveling bag.
In which' Phe had packed as much change
of dress as it would conveniently carry.
At CarsMi City she had left a case of
mining tools and other things, which were
to be delivered at the Forks, for ulti
mate transit to ihe Valley.
At the bottom ol her trunk was the
knife the Southern general had giyen her.
She unsheathed it, examined the blade,
and,, having made a few pusses with it,
fastened it to her wrist: gripped it. twist
ed It round and lingered it by way of exer
.cise; and then, shc-athintr it, hung it upon
the wall. For her own defense .on her
journey she had carried a revolver in the
back pocket of her trousers.
Taking from her bag a cap and a soft
hat she hung these by the side of those
poor Neri had left, and alongside his
clothes she pegged a coat and waistcoat.
"'Then she tco^ frcm her bag a small case

mals. The shouts of the drivers canw
. faintly upward, and there was a distant
tinkle of the bells. The air was mi'.ci.
About Ze-Ila's feet b-ailes of grass were
forcing themselves cracks and
crannies. Away over the valley; cooped
up on the side of the tall foothills of the
distant range of mountains, was the min
ing camp of the ridge, its shaftings and
its mill plainly visible. On the near side
of it, no doubt between Platts Valley and
the Gulch, was the Drift; shd could see
the smoke of its eujrine-stack curling in'
white wreaths amon^r the trees. It was
there that Abner Digges reigned supreme.
He had been the luckiest man in the Val
ley. His luck had ccrrte with a drift that
he had driven blind, as a man might raise
the ante at poker -blind; and he had
struck the ore rich and thick between that
and a former shaft, which the boys of the
Valley had driven, as 'they -thought, in
the wrong direction, and so had aban
doned it. as it turned out, right on the
Very lead they had been working for.
Digges had been one of the first in the
Valley, though not before Dankes; and
had, from his first drink in .the saloon,
asserted a physical supremacy over most
of them. At Blin'l Man's Drift he was
boss. In the adjacent camps of Platts
Valley he was feared; but he had oppo
nents. His record was one of blood, and
he gloried in it: at the same time claim
ing that he had always fought fair.
Zella stood looking out upon i the vast
landscape, hill and dale and mountain,
with flashing bends of the river, that had
big shallows about the Drift, shut in by
a sudden bank and bowlders and rock,
that equally hid the busily worked claims
of Abner Digges. It was an Inspiring
scene. The restfulness of it, however, dis
turbed Zella in a way which she did not
anticipate. It. seemed to say to her "Let
the dead rest; go back to Parkside; leave
vengeance to God; you are a woman;
put off your jerkin and resume your
woman's clothes; why desecrate this fair
scene with a ne^v bear of tragedy? Di<3
not your lover, whom you would avenge,
declare that 'twould have been better to
leave the gold where God had left it, hid
den beneath the hills and covered with
llowers?" .
CHAPTER XXXII.
BEHIND THE MASK OF PHILIP
GREY.
A strange introspective mood in which
to encounter Abner Digges. Yet it wÂ«3
no ether than he who almost suddenly ap
peared to -her. for she had been so ab
sorbed with her thoughts and the scene
before her, that she had not noticed his
approach; nor could she for a moment
have anticipated it, seeing that Dankes
had ieft her under the impression that she
would not be di&turbod,
"Morning," lie said. "I reckon you're
Mr. Philip Grey?" ,
Then. he paused and looked at her, as
. if for a â¢ moment he was searching his
memory.
"Yes," said Zella, with as much uncon
cern as she could command* "My name
is Philip Grey."^ .
"Mine's Abner Digges. I hear'n as Old
Prudent was a-sayln' there wa3 a young

for months or more, I wornted to see the

"But I am not come from Mr. Dexter '-
said Zella.
"Oh! Then it was a lie?"
Â¦ .".Well, not exactly. I said I had at one
time been In the employment of Mr
Dexter."
': "Tn Chicago?" ' vv>-'
"He had a woman typewriter there."
"Don't say. Well, it don't foller as you

"Sorry I do not, since you seem anx

perfect coolness:

required the . full command- of -her wits,
that Zella .waa strong; she, never lost her
self-possession when most she needed it

"Come to thai, young 1 feller, I don't
reed no recommendation. Your face is

"And has given me a good character?"
paid Zella with a grateful smile.
"Why, yes. Ain't it, Dave?"
"I s&ld as you was no tramp or greaser,
cr eech," said Dave. "But I didn't reckon
you up, r.ayther."
I "I am not just a mere adventurer. I've
pot a bit of money; Juet enough dollars, I
think, to pay for a claim, if there is one
worth buying. But, lirst, I want to
learn the ways of the camps and the sort
of work that's wanted."
"Don't you min<S explain'," caid Dankes.
"Dave paid you was worn out, just dead

Jim. who ha-1 been curled up by the
cide of his emptfed bowl, winking his eyes
In the far-reaching light of . the open
etove. now began to take an Interest in
tbe proceedings. Zella, revived by the
coffee, helped herself to bread and m^at.
Jim eniffed at her legs, and then rubbed
his r.ofe? -apainst the flour-barrel leg of her
easy chair.
"Jim vouches for yer also," fa'd
Dankes, as Zeila turned to- look at the
<!og. and to pat his smooth white head.

"No doubt," eaid Philip, in a low voice.

"And there ain't been no rain to molder

the rugs ciore the stove, all the same,
ETiVcor."
"Good! He's a right cute fellef, Dave."
Bald Dankes. once more addressing Phil

3'd gone melancholy mad when I lost my
Xwvrd. Here y'are: genuine Old Tlye."-
Dankii lupg^d the jar from the chest,
mnC pushed it toward 1'hilip
"And ef you'ro for a. pipe, why, you can

and pulled Ins chan nearer the stove.
"It's a chilly night," said Dankes, imi
tatir-t the example, with; However, a big
ger &o of whisKy; "but we'll have sum
mer on us beioic we can eay Jack Room
ten, as Ned Glover wouid ha' put it."
Suddenly Ji:n made for the door, with a
growl.
"No 'casion to show your teeth, Jim,"
said Dave: "it's only old Jumper, with
;he stranger's L-i-<ssuse."
Jim riunii back to his corner, rebuked.
â¢"Oh. dcu't tiike it to heart," said
Dankes. "XiEve didn't mean to hurt yer
fecMn's."
Jim crept gratefully to his master and
watched the door from the advantage of
his chair.
"Conn.: on," said X>ave, opening the door.
Yv'htrcupon there entcrc-u a hairy Hercu
les with a leather trunk on his Lack and a
heavy bag in his right har.d. The bag he
droppc-d by the door, the trunk he llusig
into the middle of the cabin lloor.
"Where'll you have 'em, boss?" asked
Jumper, looking around the cabin, his
prominent blue eyes blinking in the lamp
light.
â¢'Better put 'em in Mister Glover's room,
eh. DaveT' â¢
"Guff--* that's right," said Dave, laying
hold of the bag, while ihe Jumper hauled
at the trunk.
"Kir.d of you, Bill. Take a drink and
ef you ain't no serious objection a dollar
cr two. eli?"
"Don't want no dollar, boss, but I'll take
a drink."
"Might I contribute a trifle to your
banking account?" eaid Philip, coming
forward, his hand in his pocket amons
coins that jingled.
"Not es my guest, mister, which you
are, 1 reckon." interposed Dankes. "Bill's
right; we don't pay for civilities with dol
lars. But I owe Bill oil account, and I
mean ter pay it now; else, by the livlni'
Jingo, it's goin' teT~l/e a shootin' mat
ter."
"Here we go, boss," taid^Bill. touching
the Oiled gia^s of Dankes, who, repeating
the shibboleth, they drank their liquor;
and, as Bill left the cabin, Dankes thrust
a Jive-dollar bill into his hand with the
whispered remark, "Don't tell me; 1 know
you're down on yer luck. Damn vtr pride;
take it."
"A loafer," said Dankes as he closed the
dcor and sat clown. "A regular loafer, but
good naturtd and proud, as ef he'd never
lilled up at a free lunch r.or sat into a
poker deal with no more chips than he
could borrer."
"I'll fay good-night :;ow, guv'nor."
"Good-night, Dave. Don't be late in the
mornin'."
"Now ccme, guv'nor. am I ever late?"
"No, Dave, not as 1 remember; but you
must allow a man ter say somethin'."
"Your pardon, guv'i.oi ; suy just what

you'd like to look at ypUI bunk and things
and see ef there's anj thing' else you
wanjLV
"Thank you, no; much obliged."
"W.i, that's ail right," said Dave. "Good
night."
A.s he opened the door Jim jumped after
him and-the two disappeared
*'i>o you believe as duys lias souls?"
Dankes asked, smoothing his beard, as he
biew a long cloud of smoke up among
the rafters of the cabin. <
"More deserving than must men, many
of them, I do believe."
"My own solid opinion, mister," said
Dankes. "'There's men as ain't fit to be
named with the onnerest damned cur as
was ever pupped."
He was evidently thinking of Abner
EHjjges.
"Inat's so," said Philip, who was prob
ably thinking bf the same ruffian.
"Likewise." : said Dankes, with Xed
Glover in his mind, "there's men as might
ha' chummed with the Angel Gabriel."
"I dure tay," said Philip, her heart
going out to the same sweet memory, and
forgetting for the moment that 'she was
Philip Grey and not Zella Brunnen, under
which influence she glanced toward the
door of the room that had been her lover's
chamber and was destined to be her own.
She had not exactly contemplated thia
â¢when she made up her mind to seek out
Solomon Dankes and abide there at least
for the night. Something had, however,
drawn her thither. All the way along the
road she had thought of the cabin Clqver
had described. Her adventures had been
many, but, on the whole, she had man
aged to maintain her masculine ciiaracter
with success. It was well, perhaps, that
Lefore she loft Chicago she had accus
tomed hersoif to Xed's empty room at
Porkslde, even to wearing, though only
for a short time, his very clothes, which
ehe had kissed with reverence and on
which ghe had made her vow of venge
ance.
"There was my pard, for example," con
tinued Dankes: "his name was Glover â
Xed Glover. There was never in this
world a better feller. 1 spotted him for
reai grit the minute I set my eyes on him:
and I ain't been deceived much in mi
time' wheu I've said to myself a feller's
real grit, one to ftand by a friend and a
comrade, where he do stand, as stands to
the death. It's' a true saying that the
best goes fust! But you're not drinkin".
Dave said as you was dead beat: I guess
you shall turn In, ef you feels like it,
right away. No? Well,- another drink,
and then?'
"Thank you, I am quite comfortable,"
said Zella, trying to suppress herself, and
be Indeed Philip Grey.
"Youngsters eoon gets over beln* tired:
I remember there was riawthin' I could do
as would ha' tired me." '
"But you are not an old man."
"Ain't sixty, or thereabouts, old?"
"Not at all. In these days."
"What do you call old, then?"
"Oh. ninety or a hundred."
"I wouldn't want to live that long."
"Why not?"
"I dunno; seems unnat'ral. My father
lived to be eighty-five, and he was dod
derin' and mumblin', and couldn't see,
and that's no sort of good in our busi
ness."
"No, I suppose not; have to keep your
eyes open and your hands busy."
"I gruess so; not as he was a burden thÂ«
dear old dodderer. He'd be'n a fine man
wunst, and he was my father and I was
his son, and I guv him some trouble in my
time. I reckon. You got a father?" â¢ â¢
"I had; he was killed on the Indian
frontier in an ambuscade." . ,
"A soldier?" ;Â¦'- \
"Yes."
"God rest his soul!"
"And your mawther?"
"Died when I was a pickaninny."
"I never knowed my mother. "She died
In Philadelphia when me and my father
v.as prospeotin' and tryin' our luck', and
playing ducks and drakes with the few
dollars he'd saved in Californ."
"You've had a hard time, then?"
"Nawthin* to complain of."
The two went on talking in this give and
tnke way. Zella now and then lighting a
fresh cigarette, Dankes renowitipr his pipe,
both in a lazy if inquiring mood.
"Where did you come oil the track? At
Carson City?"
"Yes, I think It was."
"Got- the stage to the Red Horse
Forks?"
"Yes." J
"Pack of mules at irie Forks?"
"Yes."
"Pesky critters, them mules."
"There was a mule team most of the
way."
"You don't say. Than It's the fust. ; Mla
ter Hiram Dexter, they say, has let on
in his lett/ers a good deal about mule
teams ami waggons from Platts Valley
Where did the team quit?"
"I think they called it Pike's Canyon."
"A hell of a clirnb after that, eh?"
"Yes."
"Kf they could work a way round tho
bluffs we'd get the waggons right through
but that's our trouble; it's the cost of"

Zella fetched the jar of whisk . and two
glasses, and placed them on the benth
Subside. She thought it a favorable op
portunity to study Her Polic>.
from her first conception or her plot, wus
to make friends with him. to worn out
the secret of his fence, to discover the
weakness of his physical armor. to. win
him into an attitude of ccntideace. infcr^
was no meanness or subterfuge th*t
would not, she felt, lo condonfcd or Justi
fied in a. contest between a woman and
such a monster. It was wonderful, she
felt afterward, that she could have neiU
paileiu interourse with Nea's murderer,
but she did so, and Digges came to tne
conclusion that, it" they had met before,
it had" been under agreeable circum
stances, in some Infamous rtsort, pernaj>&,
on a bender.
"Wail, what' a the odds whar'^weve
met, voungster? Here we go!"
"Here we go:" responded Z'-Ha and
drank the heaviest s;.msh of whisky she
had ever taken In her life.
'â¢Reckon we'll mt-et down at the sa

Dankes that I took the liberty of tomln

"1 shall tell- him, Mr. Diirse.V -said
Zella. 'â¢- â¢:--'-.

"You iow-browe J. - squint-eyed, heavy-

Zella, when he had di.-iap^caroJ. "uh,

Then she sat down and thought over
what DiuTes had said. She had never
known that Dexter had business relations
with this scum of the gutter. * â¢ *
When she mentioned that Dexter had a
woman typewriter in Chicago, she was
feeling her way for possible information
in the direction of the remarks she had
ovf-rher.rrt in t,hc ha!! of the Grar.d Pa
ci!ic; how love-, or what some call love,
would overthrow a man w ;;o waa bitten
at CO. If Dexter had done some more
strangely eccentric thing than make mad
love to her, f-s lie had done when she qult
u-d his service; It might have been a se
quel to his conduct when they parted. It
was curio-.'.s that he should have Inter
course with Abner Digges: such inter
course as would win rant Digges in
being anxious about - him on the
ground of money. Could Dexter have
known that he was sending Glo
ver into the same camp with tliÂ«Â» m.-m
â¢who had sworn to kiil him? * * â¢ W;rs
Dexu r's absurd passion for her so ma':,
ko tempestuous, so cruel, so selfish, tha:
Ills jealousy of Glover cpuld induce him to
con*pire against his life? â¢ â¢ â¢ No, no;
the thought was too brutal. Whatever
Etexter might be, his disposition was
kindly. She lad known of many a gen
erous act of his. that could only have
been prompted by a really benevolent na
ture. * * * It was true h<? hrul behaved
somewhat scandalously to her; but that
was, surely, ur.di r the influence of wine.
* â¢ â¢ Anyhow, she' would not entertain
for a moment the cruel thought that had
crossed her brain. â¢ â¢ * Surely if there
had been any business relationship be
tween him and Dlgges , before the raon
ster's appearance in Chicago she would
have known it. â¢ * â¢ And now she re
called, in vivid detail, haw he tried to
blacken Glover's character, with the dra
matic sequel of the triumph of Bridget

ously asserting their rights to a share in
jjhe government of Europe, it is curious
to notice how. up io a comparatively rp
cent date, some of the most experienced
even among English statesmen and dip
lomatists set down Prussia as <-ountiiiK
for nothing in European affairs. How
such an idea came to exist concerning a
people more highly Â»-ducated ;i? a whole
than any other in Europe and almost en
tirely free from the distraction of con
flicting nationalities in one state system,
it is not necessary for my present task
to inquire too curiously. But it is certain
that up to the middle of th? century the
yearning for German unity, which found
fo much expression in bocms and treatises
end discourses throughout German popu
lations, was regarded In Europe generally
as the mere dream of Teutonic students
and sentimentalists. The. hour ar.d the
man came with the rise of Rlsmarck to
the front, and it was soon evident that
the two stars of Austria ami Prussia could
not keep their motion, in tiie one sphere
of Germany: and tne triumph of Prussia

controversy. Then the world began to see
that France and Prussia were drifting
into rivalry. II. Provo.-t-ParadoI, In words

collision. The result of the collision was
the fall of the second empire in Fra'nce
and the elevation of Prussia to the su
preme position in German affairs, with a
German Emperor to preside over her
council? and an organization of minor
sovereigns to support him.
Austria and the N:ar Eist
Austria has h:td to make great sacrifices
during the century, but the rafcrfflcejS
"would be cheap if they obtained for what
remains of the empire a moro thorough
union of interests and sentiment. Tl\e,
. Austrian empire, as we know it In modem
times, has been compelled to try to Its
utmost strain the experiment of holding
together R large number of diverse (na
tionalities under one central authority.
The EmjH-rors of Austria had Italian,
3iuni?ariJLn. Bohemian, Polish and German
populations under their sovereignty, an-l,
indeed, the whole AuÂ«trlan rystem in tlila
century i\as the direct outcome ot tho
policy which Inspired the Congress of Vi
enna. Such a policy could come to noth
ing but lailure, and Austria, as its must
characteristic embodiment, socn found
that her peculiar composition proved an
irresistible temptation to some of her ri
vals on the European continent. France
assailed her through her Italian popula
tions, and Bismarck later on followed the
example. A little earlier in the history of
the centuty Hungary had gone into rebel
lion, and would, beyond all question, have
secured her absolute independence but
that Russia intervened and won for Aus
tria the victories which Austria was un
able to T .vin for herself. Of late years Hun
gary has obtained something like recog*
nition of her national right to domestlo
self-government, and there seems no rea
son why the Austrian empire as it now
stands should not hold safely and har
moniously together. Russia has grown
and consolidated remarkably during the
present century. Her Influence is now
probably greater than it ever was before,
although she Is no longer regarded with
that widespread suspicion and dread
which, about the middle of the century,
seemed to set her down as a mere bar

hardly be too much to say that the whole
work of modern science which has to do
with the practical affairs of every-sJay
life has, so far as It has cot. been accom
r'ishod in the nineteenth century. Of
course, there were great scientific discov
eries made in the definition and the appli
cation cf natural laws to human life at
various periods, early and late, in the his
tory of the world, which each succeeding
generation has only confirmed and ex
tended. But what I wish to point out is
that the practical silence of the nine
teenth century has made more change in
the ordinary conditions of human life
than was made by any century, or all the
centuries, which went before it.

The Opening Years of the Century.
The century opened for Europe In an
Interval of war, which was mistaken, at
the time, for a return of the rÂ«?ij?n nf *
peace. The period cf storm brought about
by the French rtcvolution, a revolution
which was in itself directly influenced and
forwarded Vy the success of the American
f^rupKle for independence, had come to a
temporary InllJ and many observers in
Kn,?land and in France fondly believed
that the international strugs-le had come
to an end. The history of Europe for
many years had been, and still for some
jreara was to be. the story of one man's
genius, ambition and energy. It Is not
necessary in this narrative to consider
crhat misht have been the effect cf the**,
Kronen Revolution, if the othf r grsat pow
i rs had been content to leave to France
the working out of her own destinies, and
had not made It their policy to force on
her their Ideas as to the manner in which
Krancr? ought to be poverned. The alli
ar-ee of the other great powers against
revolutionary France gave the military
genius of Napoleon an e.pportunity of
Etxm-ips itts power, and enabled Napoleon
to became Dictator with the title of Km
pcror. '"The meteor of conquest," to
quote Byron's wcrds, allured the Kreat
Emperor too far. Napoleon attempted en
terprises be-yond even his power to accom
pllsb; be tried to make himsr-'.f the Dicta
tor of Europe, and he failed.
The interval of peace with which the
c- -tury eperied was followed by the
fiercest tstrrxsste* between France and al
lied Europe, and the Duke of Wellington
brought the wholÂ«> conflict to a close by
his victory at Watc-rlnc. Napoleon may

downward course which It has apparently
been her destiny to pursue ever since her
gre,at days, when her possessions ex
ceeded those of any other European state.
The story of the century has been for
Spain a melancholy story of descent and
decay. She has had many changes pi
dynasty, and has even known popular
revolution, but no revolution has yet come
which seems to have had the power of
breathing into her the spirit of progress.
Her colonial possessions, the last relics
c! her greatness, have been in recent
years a source of much trouble to her.
The manner In which she endeavored to
keep tluwn her colonia! populations
brought her at last into a hopeless strug
gle against the great and growing power
of the United States. There seems some
thing almost whimsical in the fatality
which thus exhibited Spain as an utterly
unmatched antagonist for the people of
that continent which first knew civiliza
tion through her, when she was at the
height cf her power and her glory. One
would think that any intelligent Spaniard
would have seen, long ago. the Impossi
bility of maintaining in our days a sys
,em of medieval tyranny over a popula
tion living on an island which can be seen
from the shores of Florida, on the great
American continent. Every rebellion
.igainrt Spanish rule in Cuba made the
territory of the United States its refuge
ground after defeat, and its field of prep
aruilcn for the next struggle. The war
between Spain and the United States was
i.f short duration, and it ended, as every
unprejudiced observer must have known
it would end, in the defeat and humilia
tion of Spain. Thu friend* of Spainâ and
in one sense at least we are all friends

honor to any European state. We have
not to go far back into the leading of
modern history to arrive at a time when
the very name of a Greek was held to be
the symbol of duplicity. Ignoble craft and
chicanery, just as it used to be in the
days of Juvenal. The inspiration of ge

only served more and more to

made some mistakes and blunders in their
efforts at the reconstruction of Turkey's
Ill-managed dominions. But the general
result of these efforts, including the work
of the treaty of Berlin, was to establish
the complete emancipation of several
Christian provinces from the rule of the-
Ottoman power, and their elevation to the
ranks of independent and self-governing
states. There are good omens for the

The nineteenth century .would be mem

the fact that It saw the development of

American colonies into the great republic
of the United State?. The American re
public' is now In population, commerce,
trade, shipping, industrial science and po
litical influence one of the greatest states
in the civilillzed world. The republic. has
not attained thi3 position without serious
internal struggle, and even convulsion.
The great Civil "War between the North
ern and Southern States, which broke cut
forty years ago. was a strife so Ions and
so fierce that it seemed to outer observers
at one time to threaten the disruption oÂ£
the republic. The Northern State?, how
ever, triumphed at last, after a sacrifice
of life and wealth not exceeded In Its pro
portions during: modern history, and a
wise and forbearing 1 policy on the part nC
the conquering States brought enemies
back into friendship, and established not
merely the unity but the T'rion of the re
public. - With the clcse of the war came
the end of the distracting slavery ques

cerned, nnd the United States were left
free to pursue their career of prosperity
nnd civilization undisturbed by that one
element of disunion and of damper which
had been thetr most aertina trouble sinca
the Declaration of Independence. Tho
I*r.!t?d States have, for the greater part
of their 'history, enjoyed a perfect im
munity from the risks and troubles of
war. En th? early part of the century
Great Britain and the United States were
drawn Into a dispute about England's
claim to maintain the rijrfct of search, a
tradition, in fact, of the old days when
the States were still rolbnleS. The dis
pute led to a war. It may be safely said
that the bc?t inU'lIfot* In political life on
both sides of the water were, utterly op
posed, to the idea of makin.tr such a dis
pute a. subject for arbitration of battle,
out the obstinacy of the sovereign on this
side nnd the excitement of certain politi
cians on the other prevailed over wi3er
and calmer counsels, and a war broke out.
Peace was soon restored, aeeins that
neither country had reuch heart In the
war, and a settlement wan agreed upon,
which may be falrSy described as an un
derstanding that England waa never
again to raise her claim, and that nothing
more was to b? sÂ»a!d upon the subject.
Since then the United States have had a
little war with Mexico, and that atrusrsle
with Spain which ended so qulelrty a few
months ago. It should be added as a fact
of some historical importance, that both
the war with Mexico and the war with
Spain were undertaken in opposition to
the opinions of many most enlightened
Americans, who maintained, and still
maintain, that the policy of the republic
ousht to be the policy laid down by
George Washington â the principle of ab
solute non-intervention In the affairs of
foreign states.
Th*> Indian Empire, as we now kno\v it,
is al?,i one cff the creations of the nine
teenth century. An entirely new system
of government ha* been able, at least, to
fill the native populations with the con
viction that justice will be done to them.
and their interests properly cared tot
under thÂ«? developing and improving im
perial spirit, and has besrun. also, to fill
large triages cf the native populations
with a desire to be ident'fled with the new
work, ami to feel proud of India's place
in the empire. No one who has read his
tory needs to be told that the conquest of
India wa^ not always effected by means
which were likely to win the allegiance of
the native princes and peoples- Llttlo
more than midway In the century's courso
the great Indian mutiny broke out. which
threatened for a while to Interrupt thjÂ»
whole work of British settlement. TherÂ»
can be no doubt that some of the native
ruler? and populations had grievances to
complain of, and that their national tra
ditiona and sentiments, as well as their
religious feeling?, had sometimes been
carelessly or wantonly disregarded by tha
rulers sent out from England. Moreover,
it cannot be doubted that the events of
the Crimean war had some share In.
arousing the temper among native princeÂ«
and peoples which brought on the Indian
mutiny-the Indian rebellion as it might
more properly be called. The Crimean
war wa3 undertaken by England, France.
Turkey and Sardinia In order to prevent
the encroachments of. Russia in tha
southeastern parts of Europe.
What the native Princes and popu.a
tions of India saw. as tbe campaign went
on, was that It took thÂ» whole united
strength cf those four powers to forcÂ«
Russia into terms of submission and tha
conclusion arrived at in the native mtn-1
was that as England could not do the
work herself and even with the assistance
of France, Turkey and Sardinia found it
a hard piece of work to accomplish, tha
reason must be that England was falling
off in strength and v.as no longer to bo
dreaded as a master or relied upon aa an
efficient protector. No chapters In the
world's history are full of more thrilling
xcenes than those which were enacted
during that Indian rebellion. The gener
ation which was living and reading news
papers then couid not forget thÂ© events,
terrible In their tragedy, often sublime
In their illustrations of human heroism
and patience, which wero brought day
after day to the knowledge of the clvi'.-
Ized world. England was* never better
served by her generals and her soldiers
than during that epoch, of severest strain.
The brave, wise and fcu-nar.e policy of th*
Viceroy, Lord Canning:, son of George
Canning. â¢ was criticized severely at the
time by some censors In India and at
home, but it vindicated Itself In the end.
The rebellion waÂ« suppressed at last arJ
ore of the results uC the whole' crisis
was the extinction of the East India Com
pany and the transfer of India to the
sole control of the sovereign and Parlia
ment of Great Britain and Ireland. Som3
lessons were taupht by the outbreak and
by the sacrifices made for its suppression,
which had their effect on the policy sub
sciurntly pursued in the government of
India. The main objt.-ct of Indian rule
ever since has been ?.:> brir.? the popula
tions of India into a genuine allegiance
toward tite imperial sysiera, to make them
feel that they were sure of just and equal
treatment and that whatever advantage*
the empire opened f> the career of any
other of its subjects was open also and
equally to every native of India. Xo doubt
there have been mistakes and blunders
and shortcomings here and there In tho
carrying ollt of tIi!s "r?at work, but It
is only common justice* to say that th<?
main object of the work is such as I have
described it. and that its beneficent effect
\a felt more and more every day through
out the great Indian peninsula. Educated
natives of India have represented Eng
lish constituents in the House of Com
mons, the Civil Service and the bar of
England have given* I career to men of
Indian birth, and it rmy well be hoped
that the Englishman i.s destined to hold

But in decorations you could go to an al
most unlimited extent. A short time agro
I assembled a dinner of eighteen covers,
which cost in the aggregate thirteen thou
sand dollars; that Is over J722 a cover. It
waÂ» and still is the high-water mark in the
matter of dinners. In order to go higher
I should simply have to take each course
and each decoration and trv to supple
ment it by some more expensive item. It
is, after all. the decorations that cost so
much in these dinners. In the eighteen
thousand dollar affair I decorated the
room with a natural grape arbor, through
which the guests walked and from which
they plucked the bunches. Then there
was a fountain with fish in it, which in it
self was an expensive affair, entailing
much plumbing and carpentry work. The
flowers were all out of season, and vet
many plants were shown growing in the
native pot. It was these decorations that
cost bo much. In the most expensive din
ner I might have rare Japanese palms or
dwarf trees bearing fruit, such as cher
ries. I could send to the Orient and im
port at a colossal expense any of the fruit
bearing trees that grow there. Dwarf
pears, apples and other fruit are some
times brought to this country, and I could
have them growing on the, table, or the
dining room would be arranged as a gar
uen. in which birds would sing, plants and
ferests in the matter of food production.

ot Canada to the British Empire. Down
to the opening of Queen Victoria's reign
tho populations of upper and lower Can
adaâin other words, the populations
mainly of I'lezich or of English extraction
âhad been like two hostile encampments,
while the only sentiment commpn to both
was the sentiment of hostility to the home
Government at Westminster. Early in the
prc-bent reign this latter feeling displayed
itself in actual rebellion, and cne of the
lirst duties forced on tlie Government of
the younÂ£ Queen was the subjection of the
rebellious Canadian provinces. The Gov
ernment then sent out .1 man of genius,
Lord Durham, entrusted with almost ab
solute poworn for tho work of pacification,
and Lord Durham doviscd for Canada a
system of legislative srlf-sovcnjment
which has been completed by the forma
tion of what is now the Dominion of Can
ada. Absolute content, devoted loyalty to
the crown and the imperial system, and a
steadily increasing prosperity have been
the results of Lord Durham's policy. The
Australian colonies have grown from what
was chiefly regarded in England as a con
veniently remote settlement for convicts
into one of the most prosperous and prom
ising parts of the British Empire, An act
of Parliament passed in the* last year of
the century crowned the work by creating
the Australian Commonwealth, and this
doing for the Australian colonies what
had already been done for the provinces

found anticipations of coming prosperity.
The Progress of Britain.
I have purposely left the story ef.the
British Islands for the last in my 1 rapid
survey of the century's dealings with
most of. the countries In the world. No
national convulsion, no revolutionary
changes, disturbed the progress of these
islands during? the period which it is my
task to survey. The reign of Queen Vic
toria occupies nearly three :p:^rtn of. that
time, and during all those long- years the
safety of the empire at home has never
been threatened t>y any fonlgn foe.-. No
Knyiish statesman during that time has
ever had to confront the risks and .dan
gers wldch mu.st more than onco have
pressed upon tho mind of a Thieru, a Ca
vour,'or a. Bismarck. Kngland, as we
have Men, has been ongagvd in foreign
wars, and has had to deal with many a
crbis in ifce northwest provinces of Aela,
in 1-JinduHtan, in Egypt, and in South
Africa. At home her career has been one
of unbroken and pteadily growing prosper
ity. The century has been for her a pe
riod of pacilic reform and of political ad
vancement. It paw tho establishment of a
genuine system of representative govern
ment, it saw Ifce birth and the growth of
the great philanthropic" reforms which
protect the labor of the poor- and .tho
young from the old-time tyranny'.of'.'un
scrupulous taskmasters, it saw the pass
ing, uf the act which put an end to slav
ery in the colonies, -the abolition of flog
ging in the army and tho navy, and the
removal of the odious disqualifications
and penalties which were onco inflicted
upon any manner of dissent from the es
tablished religion of the state. The cen
tury began with the earnest efforts of a
few advanced reformers to obtain some
thing like a system of national education
for the populations of these islands. Some
thirty years before the century's close
these efforts were, at last, crowned with
success, and we have now in England a
system of popular education such as some
other countries in Europe had been enjoy
ing for many Ions generations. . The whole
fiminclal system oi the country has like
wise undergone a complete change. The
doctrines of free trade which were com
monlv held to be the notions , of mere
theorists, so lately even as the days of
Adam Smith, were adopted by. Sir. Robert
Peel as tho inspiring principle of practical
legislation. Let it be added that, the cen
tury has seen in the present reigning sov-
erelgn the first really constitutional mon
arch whom England ha3 ever known.
A Century of Intellectual Greatness.
The century has undoubtedly been one
of Intellectual greatneBs. "Man's uncon
querable mind,", to adopt the language of
Wordsworth, has had Its victories and its
triumphs in every Held. There have been
great stntcaniMt who were also great ora
tora, like Canning arfd Peel and Gladstone,
like Thlers and Gambetta and Castelar.
There liavo been- great statesmen who
were not orators, like Cavour and Ui*
marck. In Â¦ literature Kngiand has had
two great , epochs during the_ century.
First camo the. time- which is represented
by Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley nnd
Keats and Lamb and Hydney Sniith, and
then the later times which .we associate
with the names /of Dickens and Thack
eray, of Tennyson and Browning, of Aia-r
caulav -and Grote, Thomas Carlyle Hnd-
John Stuart Will, of Freeman, Froude nnd
Green, of Charlotte Bronte and George
Eliot," of Matthew Arnold, Swinburne,
Itoeeettl, Morris and many others almost
equally celebrated. Franco has had
George Sand and Victor Hugo, the elder
and the younger Dumas, Ualzac, -Alfred
dc Mussel r.ntl a whole host ofpoets, no\ v 
ilists and writers o* history.* The Scandi
navian populations have, developed quite
a literature of their own both in romance
ond In the drama, and while in tho earlier
part of; the century no story-teller could
have been more universally popular than
Hnns Christian Andersen, in its latter
half no livlns dramatist was > nearly ao
much admired, so much imitated, so much
criticized, so much "denounced * and so
much the subject o* worldwide discussion
as Htfnrik Ibsen- ..Russia, too, has devel
oped a literature of her own during the
century, and has compelled the. whole civ
ilized warM to give attention to it, to rec
ognize and tQ welcome It. No nair.es are
more famous In living -literature than
those of Tolstoi and Turgenlelt, and
th^e two great novelists have already
schools of followers, and of Imitators
wherever;, romance- is associated -with - a
purpose and a mission. Germany has not
of fate. years done much in literature to
set the world wondering, but we must re
member that some of Schiller's and many
of Goethe's finest works and all'of Heine's
poems belong to the achievements of . the
nineteenth century. The whole' story of
America's literature may be said to belong
to the present century. It tells us of

d<r not* look 'for progressive development.
No i one expects that growth of human
thought and culture can bring out greater
sculptors than those who lived atid

architecture than that of the Parthenon
and tho Temnle of Theseus, or the Gothic
cathedrals of Christianized Europs. We
do hot loolt for greater poets than Homer
nnd â¢ Virgil, Shakespeare, Dante and
Goethe,. But in painting, sculpture, muiic
and tha dramatic arts, although not per
haps in architecture, the nineteenth pen*
turyhas fairly held its own. The world,
it may safely be declared, has never Fcen
greater actors Â¦ than Edmund Kean and
Rachel, and, in our own days, Sarah
Bcrnhardt.- and In music Germany has
created an ; entirely new 1 school of her
own. .
A Century of Thought.
There have been r great tblnkerH In the
nineteenth century who may well be
placed in the Â¦ highest intellectual ranlr.
Auguste Comte,: and Darwin, and Her
bert Spencer. The century has had
preachers and divines â¢ of tÂ£e highest or
der,, men' whose fame belongs not merely
to any one sect or denomination, but is
recognized by all the civilized world. Tho
century has been gloriously endowed -with
EOldlers, and, indeed, heroe3 in every field
of human solf-aacrltlce, with missionaries
and mHityrs. It hasi been the century es
pecially nt organized and scientific explor
ing. The work of philanthropy, too, has
been organized until it has become a rec
ognized .Institution of civilization. Even
the horrors of tho battlefield have been
mitigated by the fpirit of tho modern
time, and the p.oblc work of the Geneva
Convention has i.cne aomethlnc at least
to counterbalance the destructive busi
ness of modern military sclenco on tho
battlefield. I have already called atten
tion to the fact that nn attempt has once
again been made by one of the irjeatest
European sovereigns for the establish
ment uf a tribunal before which disputing
htates might submit their controversy to
iieureful arbitration. Nothing very decis
ive huÂ« yet come of tho rt:cent congress
held nt The Hague for this purpose, but
It Irt KomethlnK, nt loa^t, to know that
llje ruling powers of, tho civilized vorld
were wiillnff.to entertain the Wea, nnd
united, in cxprc^fflng a hope that it may
before â¢long become a practical reality.
The. common intelligence of the world Is

this vision of the Christ.
It Is part of the fascination of the life
of Christ as a topic of study that men's
views of it are boih infinitely varied and
gloriously uniform. ..There are certain
original records coniecrnlng him which
have come down tn us along a course of
seventeen or eishteen centuries and from
Â¦which all kno-wk-dge of him Ik supposed to
be derived, but every interpreter of those
records Is liable to read into them his own
Ideas. Not only so. but it is by no means
c!far that the recorders themselves quite
understood, or even that they did not
sometimes seriously miRundorBtand, the
true import of what they were writing.
Sunday-school children are sometimes
made to sins of a wish that they had
been in Palefitine when Jesus lived there.
But finch a wish partukes rather of the
nature of shallow sentiment than of re
flective wisdom. For a comprehension of
the life and work of Christ and their
moral and spiritual significance in rela
tion to Individual or universal miin. I
would rather live here and now than to
have lived even "on that hillside In Pales
tine where and when was delivered that
mntchleHS discourse^ commonly styled
"The Sermon or. the Mount." How even
the twelve misunderstood him after more
than three years of dally personal Jntor-
course with him! Judas betraying him
for a bandfur*of silver, Peter denyir.a:
with oaths ond curses all lmowleti/re of
him, and all the rest running away In or
der to avoid I fing Involvod in the. nccii
pations made against him. fiven prior to
that final time of perl!* nnd trial how, in
their anger at the hostility of some mm
to their master they 6O misinterpreted lilÂ«
spirit tllat th-?y would have s!ain thQB9
m^n'by calling down nre upon tliem from
heaven. And, to a large extent, thnt m's
undersVndinp of him has repeated itself
in niw form or another all down the agi-s
of Â«."hristfan history. Ecclesiastical vener
ation has hidden him behind clouds of in
cense burned to do him honor. His tench
ins has been libeled Ijy dogmatic state
ments and formulated cree<1^ avowedl>
framed to commend him to the minds and
hearts of men. In like manner his spirit
has been po misreprpcented by ecelesasil
cal methods and reEulatlona for propa
gating his KospeJ that he has r.eemed to
thousands' rather as one who dosed the
channels of divine love than as one w'to
would open them to all. Thus, of many
who have vaunted their authority an his
only true exi>onents, it might be said with
truth, "They, have taken away the Lord
and we know not where they have laid
him." 'Worse still, In many an Instance
where earnest souls have sought him In
sincerity but failed to find him in for
mulated creeds and ecclesiastical systems,
they have been warned, denounrt.d and
consigned to endless perdition for refus
ing allegiance' to what won. In trmh, a

Special Dispatch to The Call
OMAHA. Dec. 29.â E. A. Cudahy, the
millionaire packer, has received a second
communication from one of the men who
kidnaped his son. This time, as formerly,
the letter comes In the nature of a threat;
and says in substance that unless he with
draws his offer of $5000 reward for the
arrest and conviction of each of the three
bandits they will kidnap - another . of his
children. f
. The letter refers to the failure of the
police to get anything like a tangible
clew as to the identity of the kidnapers/
scoffs .at the- idea of Pat Crowe being
one of them, touches upon the ease with
â¢p'hieh the "first job was^pulled off" and
winds up by saying that if Mr. Cudahy
is as wise, as he showed himself in X\&
first instance he will comply with tKelr
i equest' and - withdraw the rewards at
once.
This letter is written In pen and Ink
on the same 'kind of yellow paper as the
first and evidently by the same person.
It was found by a servant of the Cudahy
household early en the morning of Thurs
day, " December - 27. Some one called -up
the house* by and asked if. Mr.
Cudahy was In.; The servant answered
that : he, was 4 not. .... . â¢/
; "Well," came the voice over the phone,
"you go out_Jn the front yard a.nd you'll
find a letter rthere, near Ahe gate. ;,.,Jt*s
addressed to Mr. Cudahy. Â¦Â£ See.: that it's
delivered to him personally and to no one
else." . ,. ; > t , â¢ .^iV.
The servant went out at dnce and found
the letter." It' was ih"~a pialh white"en"~
ve'ope and . was â¢ addressed : "Mr. e! A:
Cudahy Sr., personal and private."
Mr. Cudahy, who was then at his pack
ing-house over in South Omaha, was
summoned home at once.
No one was permitted to see the letter
at first except Mr. andÂ»Mrs. Cudahy* Mr.
Cudahy's impression at the time was that
he would keep Its contents to himself,
ass the bandits 'had requested," but later
he- thought better "of It, as_ he believed
that in the hands of the poiice it would
prove a valuable clew, so this afternoon
h? took Chief Donahue into Â¦ his confi
dence. They held a consultation at tho
Chief's j office which lasted nearly three
hours. '. Â¦â¢ -
The Chief was seen afterward, but re
fused to disclose the nature of the sub
ject discussed. * Mr. Cudahy says he has
not withdrawn the reward, nor will he do
so. The reward stands as- originally
enunciated.
Eddie McGee, alias Burns, alias Ralston,
the notorious, leader in the Beals kidnap
ing at Kansas City nine years ago, and
who served a term of five years In the
penitentiary for the crime and a term in
the Joliet prison for another offense, is
row wanted by tho. police, as the "dark
complexioned" man in the Cudahy ab
duction case. McGee is well known In
Kansas City,. Denver and Illinois cities,
and is also known to bi a frfend of Pat
Crowe. The fact that. the abductors told
young Cudahy he' was "wanted as Eddio
McGee for stealing ?.">0G from his a|int" is
considered significant. .
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 29.-McGee, alias
Burns, had as an accomplice In the ab
duction in 1S91 of Banker Beals' son a
woman who passed as his wife and went
"under the names both of Lizzie Burns
and * Lizzie Clevidence. She as well as
McGee; served' a ''five years' sentence In
the Missouri penitentiary for the crime.
The .real leader of j the gang was known
as.Ralston. who claimed to be a Denver
detective. Ralston secured the $5000 ran-
Bom offered for the return -of the child
and was never apprehended..
ST. JOSEPH, Dec. 29â For the fourth
time the police and detectives oi this city
have been outwitted by Pat . Crowe and
the men who are alleged to ; be â¢ instru T

of the police. . Captain Henry Franz led
a squad of officers in. a raid on a build
ing this evening in "which it was supposed
Crowe and Ralston, , alias McGee, were
In hiding, but 1 the officers found i no trace
of the men. Policemen Dillon and Car

that they had' left when the officers in

LONDON, Dec. 29.â The London and
Globe Finance Corporation (Lim
ited) has suspended payment.
When the brokers yesterday de
livered stock purchased on ac
count of the London and Globe and asked
for payment they received checks that
were dishonored. This was followed to
day by the failure on the Mock Exchange
cf twelve firms, as fellows: Haggard.

Jr. & Co., Cornfoot Bros.. F. A. Cohen,
Kiock^y & Buckingham. Gunn & Aubrey.
Richards & Sleper. Baker & Smith. F. C.
Watts & Co., Flower & Co. and F. Boully
& Co.
The last named' fs a big firm with im
r>"rtar.t connections. It is feared a num
ber of smaller jobbers will be affected.
While the differences of the firms closely
connected with the London and Globe di- j
vision were largely discounted, the repeat
ed fall of the hammer this morning caused
a great sensstl-m. It is feared the full l'st i
cf failures is not yet known.
Almost the whole interest on the Stock
Exchange centered in the West Austra
lian market, rhe condition of which sym
pathetically affected the othcrc. All the
f hares of the Lor.dcn and Globe group
â¢oppled, especially Lakeviews and Leroi
No. 2. The shares of the latter were yes
terday quoted at 23, but to-day they are
unsalable at 4. The London and Globe
's also heavily involved in the British Co
lumbian market. The situation is not yet
cleared up. as ihe rumors of
rrcnts to assist the London and Globe are
net credited in well-informed circles.
Thrre Is tl.e greatest indignation against
V.'hitaker Wright, who is the fountain
head of the concern, and others of the
London and Globe group. There hail been
somewhat of a recovery in Lakeviews

OTHER FAILURES PROBABLE.
Some of the Suspended Firms Will Be
Found Solvent.' |
LONDON, Dec. 30.â The Sunday Spe
cial's financial article explains that the
failure of the first three firms mentioned
In yesterday's dispatches left three blocks
of stocks unprotected, and In self protec
tion ten more firms announced their sus
pension. Other suspensions may occur ton
Monday. SeveVal of the suspended firms
will turn out to be perfectly solvent when
time is given them.
The London and Globe Finance Corpo
ration group was largely the victim of
circumstances. It had at the last moment
exceptionally heavy calls from banks at
a time when such loans were practically
impossible to obtain. li^C-
The thirteenth failure of stockbrokers
was announced before the close of the
exchange. It was that of Bartholomew &
Jacks. The fact that a crisis has been
reached In the speculations of the Whlta
ker Wright group of mines and that the
worst was known occasioned a feeling of
relief after the, strain of anticipation.
While the mining market continued' de
pressed, other departments quickly recov
ered.
The failures to-day involve twenty
eight members of the Stock Exchange
and are equally divided among jobbers
and brokers. It is generally regarded in
the mining market as being the blackest
day since the Baring smash, which was
disastrous to all departments. To-day's
crisis, however, did " not extend to the
other markets, though most of them
closed depressed. Americans were inci
dentally affected, owing to some of the
firms which failed being Interested in
American securities.
The London and Globe is said to be
largely Interested in the Baker Street-
Waterloo Klectrlc Railroad, and the trou
ble is partially attributed to the money it
has tied up in that road. *

"brutal treatment of cadets" and "secre*

of 1S39. Colonel Mills cited cases where
cadets had been dismissed from the West
Point Academy for hazing lower class
men. He said they invariably had- gone
to Washington, where they brought a
great deal of influence to bear on the au
thorities to bring about their reinstate
ment,'and in every Instance, Colonel Mill.*
said, he was ably supported by the War
Department and the dismissal wan rati

LONDON, Dec 30.â Last night's ca
ble dispatches from South Africa
add little or nothing to the infor
mation concerning the situation,
though the general trend of events
seems to show that the British are re
gaining the ground recently, lost. A spe
cial from Naauwpoort, dated December
28, reports that Colonel de Lisle defeated
Hertzog, eighteen miles west of De Aar,
capturing a number of wagons ahd releas
ing the prisoners captured at Philipstown.
Lieutenant Colonel Grenfell forced back
Kritzlnger toward Venterstad. Both com
mandos are in a desperate plight and
probably will never recross the Orange
River.
A Standerton dispatch, dated. December
28, says it is estimated that 2000 Boers
were engaged in the operations in North
Natal, hoping to break the British line
of communication. This plan failed and
the Boers were driven oft in each case
with more or less loss, their casualties in
the last day or two numbering fifty, while
, the British casualties were slight.
According: to a Johannesburg dispatch
of Friday's date General French occupied
Wentersdorp that day without opposition.
This place, being a great telegraphic-cen
ter, has been much used by the Boers for
the dissemination of information. The
possession of Ventersdorp. Richtenburg
and Zeerust gives the British a strong
hold upon this part of the country.
From Carnarvon under yesterday's date
comes a dispatch paying the Boers occu
pied Vosberg on December 27 in force and
were reported to be moving on Carnarvon,
where martial law has been proclaimed.
The loyal field cornets and farmers have
assured the authorities that they will re
main loyal and will suppress disloyal talk.
It Is credibly reported, according to a

SUNLIGHT AND THE gKA
Two Great Force* "Which Have Not
Been Mastered by Man.
"The two greatest forces In nature are
the sunlight and the sea," remarked a
college professor appropoe of nothing in
particular the other day; "yet, strange to
say, we have made little or -no progress
toward harnessing either : of ' them, for in
dustrial uses. Of course, the . effort has
been made, over and over again, and ,1
dare say scores of able men are wrestling
with the problem at this very moment,
but everything .thus- far suggested has
prcven a/ failure: The idea of utilizing
solar energy has generally taken the form
of an engine in which the sun does duty
as a firebox. A friend of mine at Wash
ington tells me that over a hundred pat
ents have been taken, out on appliances
of that sort. They are all more . or less
alike tho essential feature being a mirror
or combination of mirrors which focus the
sun's rays on a boiler of water. Some
email models have been made that worked
perfectly, but nothing on a practical scale
has ever been devised. ,
"It goes without saying that a solar en
gine can only make steam .while the sun
shines, and consequently could not be de
pended - upon for - steady work, but the
recent . perfecting Â¦ of the - storage battery
helps to remove that difficulty. When
the engine is working it could.be used to
operate a dynamo and the current bottled
up for future* use. *Of course, there would
be a good deal of power lost in the trans
mission from one form into another,' but
as long as the fuel costs nothing, at all;
that would be of no, special consequence.
When the real solar engine is finally in
vented, as it must be sooner or later, tho
world will take Borne immense industrial
strides.. It would enormously cheapen all
manufactured products/ The same i thing
may be' said' of any practical method of
harnessing the waves. That problem has
been wrestled with for; centuries, -yet on
the surface it seems comparatively' sim
ple. The device . that . suggests itself > ; at
once is some sort of buffer to receive the
firmed by the Volksraads of the two
States. In the absence of President Kru
ger, they are practically the highest au
thority to-day on gBoer affairs. They
are at The Hague and I make my reports
and send the funds to them. They see
that the funds are transmitted to minis
ters of the 1 gospel in the Transvaal.' It
does not pass through the hands of ecn
crals of the army. -
"There is greater need of money for
the relief of widows and orphans now
than ever before, and there is a large
increase of sympathy and offers of aid
In this country. ; I should say that since
the British troops had begun to drive
women and children from, their homes,
burn farm dwellings, destroy crops and!
food supplies, American contributions
have increased 75 per cent."
Mr. Pierce said he did not think it ad
visable to make public the list of donors
or amounts collected and forwarded. He

In July, 1899. the St. Helens met a ty

bylightnlng. Llttle'damage was don<?
and â¢ the vessel proceeded on her voyage.
But.lt was. found very difficult to main

the ship, and after having missed port
several times by 100 miles or more Captain
Lucknam decided that the compasses had
been influenced by; the lightning, and pro
vided ; new ones. .... ".
-There was no improvement in the situ

was kept-busy dodging reefs, which would

General Sanyiel Pearson, who arrived

"As commissary general of the Â¦ Boer
army, I- had charge of the disbursements
of money received," he said. "All bills
received my signature before being paid,
and none of the money collected here was
sent to ua. The Boers do not want money,
either for their women and children or for
themselves. This Ib not the time in the
progress of a war that we should be going
about asking money for our women. They
axe under military discomforts, but. they
do not mind them. It would be Interest

Superintendent Mills' and : Commandant
of Cadets Heln were. the chief witnesses
examined to-day. ' They, produced a lot of
extracts from records of the academy as
to the efforts made by the authorities to
abolish hazing of \ every variety in the in-.
stltutlon. 1 i â¢$-...
. Lieutenant Colonel Otto. L. Hein..com
mandant at , the . United States Military
Academy, was the first witness called to
day. Colonel Hein produced the superin
tendent's sick reports, which showed that
Cadet Booz had reported sick only once
while, he waa at the academy. He was
excused on that occasion from drill, as he
was suffering- from an acute attack of
diarrhea. The records made if clear that
Booz had never been absent from a meal
, while' he was a cadet at West Point.
An extract from the records was read
by the witness, who said Cadet Boos had
availed himself of the Saturday evening
privileges of going anywhere within the
reservation : on Saturday, August 6, the I
day of, the Booz-Keller fight. Booz re
ported his Koine: away at 1:58- p. m. and
his returning at 3:15 .p. m. In reply to
General Clous, the witness said that In
the summer of 1899. through an anonv
rnous letter, the brutal hazing of Cadets
MacArthur and Haskell came to the
Knowledge of the academy officials. An
Investigation was immediately ordered
but no Information as to the facts could
be eleclted from any of those examined,
arnong^whom were MacArthur and. Has
kell -, J ' The regulations prohibiting bazin?
provided punishment for hazers and hazed
alike. In telling of the agreement made
by the fourth-class men in 1899, among
whom were Cadets MacArthur and Grant
not to submit to hazing, Colonel i Helri
said:
I called the class together fit wan a very
lance one) and explained to them 'the rules and
regulation* prohibiting hazlne. . I told them if
they would asree not to submit to hazing ami
promise not to ha?e nny one themselves they
would rid the academy of a foul blot on Its
reputation. â¢ Soon afterward they appealed to
me to be released fmm thin agreement, but I
refused. I also heard that candidates prepar
ing at HiKhland Falls were beins hazed and I
made an investigation, the outcome of which
waa the severe punishing of the guilty radets..
The remainder of the commandant's tes
timony was mainly an explanation of the
actions of the authorities and the meas
ures taken by them to suppress hazing at
the academy. The punishments were In
creased, and the number of cadets found
fcVJ. Uy of vtolatlon s of the regulations In
1S90 was preatlY In excess of that of the
previous year. Speaking generally of haz
ing Colonel Heln said:
( 'HazinK is traditional, and I am sorry to say
is thought by persons Inside aa well as out
side of the academy to be commendable, and a*
long as- students hear It spoken of in this way
it will be impossible for the authorities to
stamp it out. -...Â¦*
Q.â What methods do you think could be used
to starai> out calling out of fourth class men
and subsequent flstic encounters? A.â Why I
consider that a form of haiinp, and as long as
the. cadets do not live up to the agreement not
to' submit to hazing. and the upper class do
not cease Interfering with them, it will be lm
poesible.to suppress It. Â«
Former Cadet Smith of Carbondale* HI
testified that one night seven of the wit
ness" class, including Booz, were called to
ex-Cadet Harlee's tent to be exercised.
Witness did not remember any one hav
ing fainted. He himself was very much
fatigued, but not to the point of exhaus
tion.
Q.â Did Cadet Boob ever complain to you ?
A.-t-No, sir: he never complained of his treat
ment. Â¦;'.â¢Â¦ -y.
Cadet Truman W. Carrithers of Illinois
the next witness, said he -was called, out
for disobeying upper class men and "gen
eral freshness.". His opponent was Mr.
Shannon of the present necond class.
Q.â What was the result? Atâ I had an abra
sion Â«-n the forehead, my JÂ«w -was broken and
I went to the hospital for two weeks.
Colonel Mills, superintendent of the
Military Academy, was then sworn.
Speaking of "bracing" he said:
I do not consider "bracing" as hazing, but
It amounts to it when carried to excess and
causes physical pain. Â¦
. For the protection of the fourth class
men the witness said he had inereasâJ
the responsibilities of the first class cadets
in order to obtain this end. He felt that
these men, on the, verge of graduation,
would use their utmost endeavors to
abolish hnzing methods.
The superintendent told of his havin?
obtained the oath of a society known as
the "hod carriers." which existed among
candidates .for admission to this academy,
Â¦who were at a preparatory school at
Highland Kails, About two miles- from
West Point. It was a society composed
of and formed for hazing candidates. Wit
ness said It was of such a vile nature tha*
he knew he had a. good weapon in h!s
hands. He submitted It to the cadet
body with the result that when they saw
what haztng entailed the graduating class
of lfOO. declared that they would- abolish
hazing.
Colonel Mills read some letters which
he had written to tHe War Department in

jt . ONDON, Dec. 29.â Major General
I Sir. Henry Colville, whose resig-

JJL^' the War Office, but who refused
to resign and came to England
from Gibraltar, arriving at Plymouth
to-day. to demand a trial by court-martial
to establish the responsibility for the yeo
manry disaster at J.indley last May, has
made a counter-strike at the War Office
in a 3000- word statement which he has
given to the press, lie says he has come
home to demand a free inquiry and does
not intend to be made a scapegoat for the
sake of the staff. He avers that the Lind
ley disaster could never have occurred
had he been informed of Lord Roberts'
intention. The primary cause of the sur
render, he says, was the insufficient in
formation given by the headquarters staff
to Colonel Spragge and himself and he
declines to accept the blame. He lays out
the facts and blan.es others. General
Colville and his inliuential friends in ana
out of the army are <nus beginning a
campaign against the new Secretary of
State lor War, William St. John Brod
erick, Lord Roberts and General Kitch
ener. It is expected to be fought out with
some ferocity in Parliament.
When he returned from South Africa,
General Colville says, he fully acquainted
the War Oflice with the facts. After some
time he was informed by General Sir
Evelyn Wood, the adjutant general, that
L,ord Landsdowne, then Secretary of State
for War, had directed him to say that
General Lord Wolseley, the commander in
chief, approved of General ColviUe's re
suming his Gibraltar command. I He
learned unofficially that an army board of
live of the highest officials of the War
Office had considered his statements and
Lord Roberts' dispatches on the subject.
His reappo,intment was the result of the
inquiry.
To his immense surprise Adjutant Gen
eral Wood,, on December 21, notilled him
that William St. John I Broderick. the
newly appointed Secretary of State for
War, held him responsible for the loss of
the yeomanry and ordered him to quit his
command inimeoiately and hand over hi3
resignation. General Colville, going into
official details, says he was ordered to
concentrate his division at Heilbron, on
May 29, and names the various disposi
tions of the other divisions which extend
ed across the Orange Free State. He as
sumed that Lord Roberts intended to ad
vance, sweeping all before him. His or
ders were absolute and he had, to carry
them out. Hence he could not go to the
relief of the 500 yeomanry without risking
the success of the grand operation. Under
anv circumstances, he says, he considered
it his duty to push on, even If he were
sure it would entail the loss of the yeo
manry. Besides he had only. food enough
for two days. > He pushed on and the yeo
manry surrendered. Lord Roberts broke
up General ColviUe's division and ex
pressed his dissatisfaction. -v
"On my pointing out that I had obeyed
his orders to the letter," declared General
Colville. "he said his orders were only In
tended as a guide."
General Colville alludes to some of the
yeomanry being millionaires and quotes
Lord Roberts as saying it was his duty
to sacrifice his force for the yeomanry.
"It will be remembered," General Col
ville says, "that the corps d'elite num
bered 500 and my force nearly eight times
that number."
General Colville recites two examples of
what he considers Lord Kitchener's "de
fective staff work."

This is why we have seen M. Zola call

This is why, when amnesty was voted,
we have seen Captain Dreyfus himself

him to reopen the affair by- ordering an

BERLIN. Dec. 29.â The recent
speeches of Count von Klinckow
strom, the Agrarian leader, and
the altitude of the Imperial
Chancellor, Count von Bulow, to
ward the Agrarians have furnished the
press this week with the main subject for
discussion, without evolving any new
â¢acts. Count von Bulow has not uttered
a word publicly to indicate his position,
and his silence wins him the designation
of the "sphinx of German politics." The
Vossische Zeitung assumes that the
Chancellor from his political associations
is an Agrarian, but his diplomatic educa
tion and experience in foreign politics
render him unwilling- to concede the Agra
rian demands wholly, since he must see
that a grain duty of CO marks would ren
der a commercial treaty policy impossi
ble. The Vossir-che Zeitung assumes that
such a duty would cause a tariff war with
the United States and Russia, the former
nr.s wiring with measures directed against
Ocnnan sugrar and the latter replying by
increasing the duty on German iron. The
I.iveral newspapers understand that Von
Klinckowstrom's utterances were intend
ed to prepare for a compromise below the
.Aprarian demands, pointing out that it
was Count von Klinckowetrom who
chocked the extreme Agrarian demands
in connection with the meat bilL
The press this week has much com
mented on a semi-official article in the
Mucnchcner Allgemein Zeitung (National
liberal) Quoting Count von Bulow as say
ing:
"Above all things, no internal crisis."
Many of the papers fear the Chancel
lor's conciliatory spirit will prevent any
vigorous policies, and others interpret his
utterance as meaning that he is ready to
sacrifice Count von Posadowski-Wehner,
Secretary of State for the Interior, in the
interests of a harmonious Cabinet. The
Count's trip to South Germany, conclud
ing with the highest decoration being be
stowed upon him by the Emperor, gives
occasion for the frequent remark that the
Chancellor is on very good terms with hia
Majesty. Nevertheless, the Cologne Volks
Zeitung, the leading Centrist organ, sar
castically asks what there will be left to
confer on Von Bulow when he actually
does something.
The trip has undoubtedly had a good
political effect. The Stuttgart Schwaeb
iscbe Mercur. the semi-official paper of
Wurttemberg. remarks that the relations
with the Imperial Government had lat
tÂ«rly grown somewhat strained, and adds
that Count von Bulow's object was to re
store the former cordiality, which he has
fully succeeded in doing. "Hereafter."
continues the paper mentioned, "the
Foutb German Government will have a
prominent participation in imperial af
fairs."
.Nevertheless the pan-German press con
tinues to attack Count von Bulow. The
Hheir.iscfce Westphaellsche Zeitung. Na
tional Liberal, accuses the Chancellor of
h.ir.giTig on to Great Britain's skirts and
expresses fear that this may involve Ger
many in complications with Russia and
France. The Lustige Blaetter prints a
striking cartoon of Count von Bulow
peering into a looking glass and asking
the question: "Who is the Chancellor in
the land?"
The looking glass reflects Emperor Wil
liam's face.
The newspapers this week refer In an
nsrgrioved tone to the continued attacks
of the Russian press upon Germany, in-
FTancing the dissemination of the improb
r hie story that Cologne and Berlin news
papers were bribed bv the De Beers Com
pany to oppose the Boer cause.
The United States Senate's action on the
Ilay-Pauncefote treaty is much discussed.

In a little over thirty years. Dr. Pierce,
assisted by his medical staff of nearly a
6core of physicians, has treated and
cured thousands of men and women who
had been given up as incurable by local
physicians.
â¢Your aedidne is the best I have ever

If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and bladder remedy, because
as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs
to health. A trial will convince any one.
To Proye what Swamp-Root, the Great Kidney Remedy, Will Do
for YOU, Every Reader of "The Call" May Have a Sample
Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for much sickneÂ«a
and suffering, therefore, when through neglect or other causes,
kidney trouble is permitted to continue, fatal results arc sure
to follow.^..
It used to be considered that only urinary and bladder troubles
were to be traced to the kidneys, but now modern science proves
,that nearly all diseases have their beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs.
Your other organs may need attention -but your kidneys most,
because they do most and need attention first.
The mild .and Immediate effect of Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great kidney
arid bladder remedy, is soon realized. It
rtands the highest for its wonderful cures
of the most distressing cases. Swamp-
Root " will set your whole system right,
and the best proof of this is a trial.
ST. LOUIS. Ho.. Nov. .20, 1900.
"I have used ' Swamp-Root for. years
whenever I was troubled with my kid-
neys, with constipation, or whenever t
felt the need of something to tone and
brace me up. This has given me such re-
lief that I do not find it necessary to take
medicine regularly now. as an occasional
dose of Swamp-Root keeps me in shape
for my workâ that of head cutter in the
Clothing Company of Rath & Jean. I am
pleased to give a testimonial for your
splendid medicine, and I cannot say
enough for what it has done for me. I
gratefully recommend it to any one need-
ing a thoroughly reliable remedy." Yours
truly, HARRY GIBBARD.

Indications of Oil Are Also Good and
a If ev Industry Will Soon Be

COVELO. Dec. 23.â News of an exten
sive natural gas discovery in Long Valley
reached here late this evening. Luther
K*dezneyer. a rancher, has for some time
noticed on a marsh on his ranch bubbles
floating on the surface and has also n>
tieed a peculiar odor trrur.d this particu
iar place. He had eevtr paid particular
attention to this until a friend ridin?
with him yesterday advised him to Inves
tigate the matter, as the bubbles might
be caused by natural gzs. After exunin
ing the place he found to bis surprise that
the water was oily and after an examina
tion by an rxpert Oil man found It to
be natural gas with extensive indications
of petroleum. A large- galvanized wash
tub m-a* placed in an inverted position on
the surface of the' mart h and a lighted
match applied to a bole punctured In the
bottom or the tub. A flame at once burst
into view, burring until it was extin
guished by those present.
This discovery will oe a valuable addi
tion to the resources of Mendodno Coun

TACOMA CHANNEL
TO BE ENLAB6ED
Bottom Will Be Scraped by Immense
Dredger and the Tide Lands
Filled In.
TACOMA, Dec 29.â The greatest piece
of dredging ever undertaken in the North
west will be commenced next month by
the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging
Company under contract with the North
ern Pacific Railway Company. As fast
as an immense dredger from San Fran
cisco can do it several hundred thousand
cubic yards of earth are to be scraped
from the bottom of the city channel
through the Tacoma tide flats and used In
filling in the tide lands on the far aide
of the channel. Two birds will thus be
killed with one stone.
The channel, which is now 100 feet wide.
will be widened to 625 feet, giving a depth
of twenty-five feet of water at low tide.
The channel is now lined on one side with
warehouses, including four wheat ware
houses built this summer,- having an ag
gregate length of 2300 feet. A heavy bulk
head is now being constructed on the op
posite- side of the channel to hold the
earth as it is deposited. Ac soon as ths
tidelands mre filled it. more wheat ware
houses and coal bunkers of 13,000 tons ca
pacity are to be constructed. The new
channel will permit the largest ships
coming to Puget Sound to load at the*e
warehouses and bunkers. A tog will leave
Port Townsend next week for San Fran
cisco to tow north, tha dredger to be uaeH
In this work.
Congress is expected to make an ap

ernment work will consist of widening and
deepening the channel further toward tha

TACOMA. Dec. 23.â John Allen, used 10,
was shot and fatally injured yesterday
afternoon by Harry Root, his playmate
of the same age. The Root boy received
a 22-caliber rifle for a Christmas present
and has spent most of his time practic
ing with it. since Tuesday morning. John
Allen was very much interested in the
new weapon and begged for permission
to go out and' see his friend use it. The
two boys, together with two other lads,
were allowed to po out to the outskirts
of the town near the reservation and
shoot at a mark. After politely permit
ting all the other boys to take a turn with
the new gun, Harry Root finally took it
up. lie was very proud of both the gun
and his own marksmanship. With great
nonchalance for a 10-year-old lad he load
ed the rifle and prepared to shoot. In
turning around toward the mark he point
ed the muzzle of the gun squarely toward
the Allen boy. "While it was still so point
ed the hammer caught in his sweater. In
stantly there was a report and the Allen
bey fell over at his playmates' feet. His
terribly frightened comrades realized that
he was seriously injured and one of them
ran for help while the other two re
mained by his side. After he had been
removed to his home, it was found that
the bullet had entered the abdomen and
cut the intestines in eight places before
it finally lodged In the muscles of the
back.
The boy is a son of Husrh Allen, a pio
neer and wealthy rancher, who ordered
that everything possible should be done
to save his life.
Drs. Cox and Howard were brought by
train from Everett to assist the local phy
plclans in operating on th<? boy. He was
kept on the operating table all of last
evening, but the most careful search
failed to locate the ball. Another attempt
will be made. The doctors have little
hope of his recovery, holding that the
chances are very slight considering the
frightful manner in which his vitals werÂ»
cut by the bullet.

Sp-oi*l Dispatch to The Call
VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec 29.â The La
dies' Hockey Club ball, one of the swell
society events of the season, came to a
standstill last night very abruptly, and
now the whole city is ablaze with taik
of the sensation caused thereby. It was
all over the mysterious disappearance of
a handsome bouquet of carnations on
nhich a very high value had been placed.
Three days ago James Pont, manager
of the Vancouver Floral Company, re
ceived an order for a bouquet of carna
tions. He ransacked every conservatory
within a dozen miles, and" after a hard
day's work and the expenditure of much
coin obtained the required three dozen.
They were for the central decorations
at a wedding. Usually carnations are as
uncommon here on New Year's day as
enow In August. Pont placed them in a
cooling box and the next night they were
stolen. Early last evening he informed
the police. Three detectives commenced
to search the town for the missing blooms.
The theaters were watched and every
variety actress in the vaudeville shows
was itquired to prove that her decorative
Mowers were made of paper before she
was allowed to do her turn. FlnaJly, just
before trudnight. Pont and the detectives
took up a position, of vantage at the
Hockey Club ball at the Hotel Vancouver.
Soon Pont recognized his carnations, or
thought he did. floating around the ball
room pinned to the garb of Mrs. Herbert
Stofse. He was so certain that he walked
f oi ward in the midst of a quadrille, and
touching the lady on the shoulder, bade
her withdraw. She took no notice, and
then one of the detectives sallied across
the ballroom rloor with the result that the
dance was discontinued and the lady was
called upon to make an explanation. She
declared that the bouquet was sent by a
friend in Victoria, and indignantly 're
pudiated the suggestion of stealing.
To-day the whole police and detective
force was turned loo?e on the mysterv,
but to far no more light has been thrown
on it.

r**n kidr^Lped by her grandparents. Dr.
and Mr*. John Wright. ,This is the charge
ma4Â« by \V. H. Campbell, the baby's
father, and this afternoon he swore to
warrant? !n Justice Wallace's court
charging Dr. and Mrs. Wright with kid
napmg.
These charge? are the culmination of a
Jr>rÂ«g >k - fight for irost-essicn of the child,
which commenced at the death of Camp-
N>Hs Â«:fe. three years ago. The mar
riage of Campbell to Wright's daughter
TÂ»a* opposed by her parents. The young
c-.uple made ihelr home with the Wrights
at the'r residence "ou Eighth and Reed
streets. Shortly after Mrs. Campbell's
<3e&ih her parents drove Campbell from
ihe bouse, retaining po&sessicn of the
child and all its mother's effects.
Campbell demanded hie child and pos
session of certain valuables left by his
wife. This was refused. Dr. Wright then
â¢ u?hed into court and applied for letters
â¢ f guardianship of the cnild and its estate.
The matitr was heard in Judge Hyland's
court and letters grained to Dr. Wright,
the gT&ndfather.
Campbell, through Attorney Fred H.
Tiiomas. appealed UJ the Supreme Court
*nd on November IS a remittiture was re
<*>:ved reversing Judge Hyland's decision
and declaring tht> fathtr the natural

Dr. Wright and his wife had left the
Btate and t&ken the child to Roseburg.
Or. Two weeks ago the court ordered the
Wrights to return tat child here to pro-
Ouce htr in court yesterday. They came
to San JcnÂ«e on December 23 and Campbell
*'*s allowed to Â»Â«e the child the next
day.
The Wrights evidently knew they were
poing to Jose the custody of the child and
hurriedly left town Wtdneeday afternoon.
They tought tickets for Saa Francisco
rnd are now believed to be on their way
Ye*:<?rt!ay Campbell was granted guar
dianship of the eh;U by Judge Hyland.
The Wrights were not represented In court
and investigation showed they had taken
the chiid with them.
The Wrights are auite weaithy and the
child is the direct heir to their estate.
It is eaid they have both declared Camp
bell will never get the custody of hii
child.
The warrants charging the Wrights
with kidnaping have been placed ta the
h&zit cf Sheriff Lcr.gfcrd and he will
endeavor to apprehend the couple.
The object of these conferences Is to aid
the undergraduate to choose the profes

'iuestion considered was "Principles. Hin

PACIFIC GROVE, Dec. 29.â The
body of college men who arrived
in this city last night to attend
the sixth annual conference of
Pacific Coast Students began
work this morning with very marked en
thusiasm and interest. Although, the con
vrntion was formally opened last night
with an able address by Rev. Dr. Fred
erick W. Clampett. rector of Trinity Epis
copal Church. San Francisco, the body
was not thoroughly organized and the
working departments were not opened un
til to-day. The business of the day. there
fore, was of great Importance, beginning
at S o'clock with registration of those in
attendance and the opening of the mis
sionary institute. The attendance upon
this conference is so large that the man
agers find the cottages usually assigned
to the use of the students entirely Inade
quate for their accommodation, and the
delegates are therefore, in college par
lane*, "spilled over" into several of the
boarding-houses near the cottages. The
quiet little town has in consequence taken
on a breezy life that it rarely wears at
this season, and the exuberant spirits of
the college men is combining with th<r
crisp, frosty weather of the last few days
to wake up the Grovcites to an unaccus
tomed extent. The University of Califor
nia delegationâ fifty strongâ is practically
in possession of the situation, and from
present indications intends to hold the
balance of power.
George W. Leavitt of New York, travel

movement in North America, is in charge
of the missionary department, and occu

The next hour was devoted to a lec

a college man's life, by C. V. Hibbard of
Chicago, and after presenting the main
point the speaker discussed in a general
manner the time, place and other environ

Â» â
Sudden IMsappÂ«arance of L D. Sav-
age From Aberdeen Keeps
Tongues of Gossips Work
ing Overtime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Dec. 29.â The recent eensa
tienal disappearance from Aberdeen,
Washington, of L. D. Savage, a steno
grapher of considerable prominence in
the Grays Harbor country, has been fol
lowed by still more spicy developments.
E\en-the sewln? circles have taken up the
matter and Savage is the subject of dis
cussion, while fancy work is forgotten.
Aberdeen Is divided Into two factions,
one claiming that Savage is a very bad
man; the other maintaining that he la a
victim of circumstances. Charges are pil
ing up against the missing stenographer
at the rate of two or three every day and
the latest makes him out a regular lady
killer. His entanglements appear to be
numerous and it Is claimed that he has a
real wife in San Francisco, whom he de
serted some time ago. Savage had been
supporting another woman In Aberdeen,
and when the news leaked out that he
had another home in San Francisco the
gossips lost all interest In the forgeries
charged against him. and commenced fig
uring that it was his domestic troubles
instead of financial matters that caused
him to get out of town on short notice.
It appears that his real wife, according
to the story which comes from Aberdeen,
got track "of him and notified him that
she longed for his society once more. She
felt that he longed to have her with him.
and on that account she would leave San
Francisco and join him.
Savage was not overjoyed at the pros
pect of having the wife and the other
woman meet In the same house. Without
waiting to argue the question he disap
peared. Then his cleverness with the pen
became known. So far the forgeries
charged against him have figured up $160.
It was his practice to issue checks and
ask people to hold them back. Some of
them he managed to redeem. The au
thorities are making a determined effort
to locate him, but so far have not met
with success.

In the conference between the Mayor

The Mayor declared his willingness to do
all, in his power to remedy the evils and
blamed their existence to the amallne?.

no power to permanently enlarge.
The committee pointed out, however
that many forms of vice were toleratei

The character which the city has gained
abroad has constituted a standing- Invi

and ply their nefarious vocations. Noto
rious criminals, whose photographs and
records are In the possession of the- po
lice, are allowed to remain In town, whea
it is known that their presence can bode
no rood. Disorderly houses flourish and
multiply, the inmates being subjected
only occasionally to nominal fines. Cash

out. were easily within police control, no

tee arcrued that a change In the policy oi
the police would strike at the root of ail
the existing- evils and mrJka the city to
an extent uninhabitable by the criminal
classes and thus effect proportionate ces

CASES AGAINST THEATER
PROPRIETORS DISMISSED
Dive-Keepers in Chicago's Downtown
District Fail in Their Betalia
tory Campaign.
CHICAGO, Dec. 29.â The cases against
Charles E. Kohl, one of the proprietors
of the Chicago Opera-house, and Man
ager Litt of McVlcker*s Theater, who
were arrested some time ago for keeping
their houses open on <5undav. were to
day dismissed by Justice Everett, who
held that so long as Sunday theaters did
not actually disturb the peace and good
order of society by creating a physical
disturbance there waa no violation of the
law in giving a Sunday performance.
The arrests grew out of the recent agi
tation against basement dives In the
downtown district, one of the alleged
dive-keepers affected swearing out the
vÂ» arrants against the proprietors of the
theaters.
Six more Indictments against alleged
downtown dlve-keepere and owners of
disorderly houses were voted by the
Orand Jury to-day as a result of the in
vestigation being- made by that body into
charges of municipal corruption. After
receiving further Instructions from Judgo
Gibbons as to the lines to pursue In the
conduct of the Investigation, the Grand
Jury adjourned until Monday.

WASmXGTOX, Dec 29.â Senator Haw

Military Committee of tne Senate, had a
talk with the President to-day about the
situation of the army bill in the upper
house. The Senator told the President he
did not anticipate a prolonged contest in
the Senate. He will go ahead with the
bill as Eoon as the Senate reconvenes on
Thursday, and unless undue opposition
develops will not ask the friends of the

time before the expiration of the morn

of the bill and send it to conference, but
If the unexpected should happen he may
be forced to contest the right of way with
the shipping bill. The Senator expressed
confidence that there would be no filibus
ter against the army bill.

FUSION PLAN
IS ABANDONED
Middle-of-the-Road Populists
Vote to Quit the
Democracy.
National Committee and Other lead
ers Vote to Continue the Fight
Independently of the
Other Parties. . .
ST. LOUI8, Dec. 23.â Members of the
Middle-of-the-road Populists' National
Committee and other leaders in various
reform movements debated all of to-day
at the St. James Hotel over the advisa
bility of forming a combination with the
Social Democratic and Union Reform par
ties.
The tenor of the speeches made by the
committeemen was practically unanimous
in opposition to the plan and in favor of
carrying on the work of the Populist par
ty strictly along its own lines, it was de
cided to issue an address Betting forth In
detail the views of the committee.
About ninety members of the national
committee were present in person or by
proxy. Neither Wharton Barker nor, Ig
natius Donnelly was here. The latter is
sick. Among those present were: Jo A.
Parker. Thomas J. Reed and J. D. John
son of Kentucky; W. S. Morgan of Arkan
sas, Colonel Frank Burkett of Mississippi,
Tom P. Pease of South Dakota, A. C.
Vantine and Joseph H. Ferris of Illinois,
J. H. Hillis of Missouri. Colonel J. 8. Fel
ter of Illinois. Colonel Thomas Wads
worth of Indiana and Miss Clara Williams
of West Plains, Mo. A representative of
the Socialist party was present in the per
son of Professor George D. Herron of
Grinnell. Iowa.
Cbairman Parker In an address Bald
that he believed In divorcement from botu
the old parties, and declared that the fight
should be carried forward without any
compromising. Mr. Parker said he haa
issued the call to representatives of all
branches of the Populist party, but that
the fusionlsts had ignored it entirely. The
time was ripe, be Â«aid. for a great polit
iccl battle, and he desired to ask the rep
resentatives of other reform movements
to stand with the middle-of-the-roaders
and make the principles of the latter
theirs.
Professor George D. Herron of Grinnell,
Iowa, who had been Invited to be present,
was asked to address the gathering on
socialism. He said that the reason Bryan
was not elected was because he was not
a radical manâ that he represented eight
eenth century philosophy and was pro
foundly ignorant of mankind and of the
present political needs. Before the last
election a strangre condition of af
fairs existed. One-third of the
voters, the speaker declared, .were not
sure hew they would vote. They were not
in sympathy -Â»lth the Republican party,
and in their extremity saw no refuge in
the platfoim laid down by the Democrats.
The result was they did the best they
could. These voters are now waiting for
a definite, clear-cut, radical programme of
reform to be presented to them, and this
they will uphold. The real issue In Amer
ica. Professor Herron said, is a clear-cut
conflict between industrial democracy and
capitalism, or the old political absolutism
brought down to date. There Is no middle
ground.
Representatives of the different reform
movements present were listened to in the
presentation of what in their opinion was
necessary to bring about the reforms
needed.
KANSAS CITY, Dec 23.â Three woman
held up by highwaymen, one of whom is
dying from injuries received; a girl at
tacked by an acid-thrower and another
girl assaulted is the record of crime In
the two Kansas Citys for the past few
boars.
At noon to-day a white man enticed
Ethel Campbell, the eight-y ear-old daugh
ter of a former Deputy Marshal, from her
home in the east bottoms and before mak
ing his escape nearly choked her to death
to prevent an outcry beingr made. The
jrirl. half conscious, vras found by a fish
crman in a desolate place near the river
and taken to the City Physician's office.
There she recovered sufficiently to give a
description of her assailant. A volunteer
posse searched the bottoms thoroughly all
afternoon, determined to lynch the man
if he couid be found. At nightfall he had
not been captured. The girl will recover.
In Edgerton, a suburb of Kansas City,
Kans., a woman clad in black threw car
bolic acid upon fourteen-year-old Eleanor
Hare's face, severely burning her cheeks
and forehead. No cause for the assault is
apparent and no clew to the woman has
been found.
"Within a few days three women havÂ«
been held up on this side of the river and
attacked by highwaymen. One of the vic
tim?. Mrs. Mary Bolder, is In the hospital
with a broken skull. She is unconscious
and cannot recover.

CRIME EPIDEMIC
IN KANSAS CITY
DETROIT. Mich.. Dec 2*.â The Ameri
can Economic Association concluded its
sessions io-day. The tirst paper of the
day was that of Dr. Thorstein Veblen of
Chicago on â¢â¢Industrial and Pecuniary Oc
cupations." "The Next Decade in Eco
nomic Theory," a paper by Professor
Frank A. Ketter of the LeUmd Stanford
University, was also read. Professor Fet
ter essayed to forecast from present ten
dencies and current theories tne direction
cf further development in the mure ab
stract branch of economics. The years
tixtcc 1&Â«, he said, belonged to the utility
discussion and to the marginal theories
vi value built thereon. The marginal
principle as a device of explanation and
as a. mode oi tnought has become indis
pensable. The old cost of production the
ory iÂ» discredited. Aa a result such fun
damental concepts as those of capital and
interest, land and rent need re-examina
tion.
The. speaker critically reviewed the de
velopment of these concepts in economic
theory, tracing the influence upon them
of .:..-.Â¦ fe-_- in industrial conditions and
concluded that:
1. The labor theory of value must be
thrown aside and the traditional division
of factors of production must be aban
doned as illogical.
2. The doctrines of rent and interest as
currently taught are hopelessly entangr'.ed
in these old and illogical distinctions.
Rent end interest ehould be regarded as
different modes of calculating the returns
to material goods, not as returns to dif
ferent agents in production or as different
k:nds of return.
S. The concept of capital must be given,
an importance in economic theory ade
quate to the dominant place of capitalis
tic enterprise in present industrial affairs.
and bÂ« redefined so as to correspond more
closely with commercial usage and the
needs of practical discussion.

MARK TWAIN WANTED
HIS "GREETING" BACK
Said His Words to the BÂ«d Cross
Made Him Feel Like a Circus
Poster in a Graveyard.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Among the many
greetings to the new century which were
received by the Red Cross Society, to be
read at Its chain of watch meetings, waa
one sent by Mark Twain. After sending
It he grot it into his head that the Red
Cross scheme was not. Just what it was
cracked up to be, and that the alleged
greetings were largely mythical. 80 a
few days ago he wrote to the management
of the enterprise:
"The list thus far Issued by you contains
only vague generalities rnd one definite
name, mineâ 'Some Kings and Queens and
Mark Twain.' Now. I am. not enjoying
this sparkling solitude and distinction,
Â¦which has not been authorized by me, and
which makes me feel like a circus poster
in a graveyard, or like any other adver
tisement improperly, placed."
He added that unless the Red Cross
manager' would send, him for publication
a complete list of contributors he wanted
his "Greeting" back. Â¦ Manager F. D. Hlg
bee explained that to* publish names at
that .time would hurt the scheme, so : he
returned the "Greeting:" with regret.

Although San Francisco has not made such elaborate preparations for welcoming the new
century as have been made by other cities of the country, it is safe to say we will have absolutely
as joyous a time of it, and will derive comparatively as big a profit from the coming age as ariv of
them. -
* ; ; â : :
It is stated that preparations have been made in Russia to begin the new century by
changing their calendar to conform with that of other civilized nations, and thus another great step
will have been taken toward establishing that uniformity of measures which will eventually enable
men of all countries to do their reckoning on the same system and by the same methods
EVENTS have moved in such a rapid and unbroken procession that when some busy men read
General Alger's attack on General Miles about the canned, embalmed and other sorts of beef
served as an army ration during the Spanish war, they will ask what it is all about. There is
an impression that General Alger could have let the matter rest with the report of the commission
of inquiry. No country ever carried on war without something of the sort happening. From the
time George of Cappadocia gouged in his .army contracts till the hasty preparation of this coun
try for our little war with Spain, wars, whether of invasion or defense, have wasted the subst.once
accumulated by peace.
From the beginning to the end of our Civil War the country was besieged with charges of
all kinds against the authorities charged with the equipment and maintenance of the army. No
doubt many of these were true. Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts, afterward Senator, still living and
president of the Indian Commission, said that: "In the first year of this (Lincoln's) administration
more money has been stolen than was spent for all the expenses of the Government in the last year
of the preceding administration." f .'
That was just before the enforced resignation of Simon Cameron. But saying it, even if
true, as it probably was, did not stop the war for- the Union nor defeat Mr. Lincoln for re-elec
tion. All this is said not to excuse nor condone war frauds, but to enforce the fact that no war has
ever been carried on without them. It was Patrick Henry who attacked a seller of meat to the
Continental army, who, he said, instead of serving his country like an honest man and a patriot, en
tered the Continental camps "bawling, beef, beef, beef!" Still armies must have beef, and con
tractors must sell it, and the Government is likely to get cheated and the soldiers to get sick. This
is one reason why i wise men prefer peace to war. This is whynhe advocates of peace abhor the
coming of war. I
We have spoken of it as a little war with Spain. But it required as great preparation as if
we were about to meet in battle shock the empire of Charles V or Philip II instead of the enfeebled
force of the good Queen Regent. Our Government knew, approximately, the military and naval
force of Spain, but it could not know, nor could the wisest foresee, the international complications
which might gather around. us in a day.
During the months in which our Congress was trying to force the President's hand he
knew that jwe were in no condition to fight even the weak. There was not powder enough in the
country to last through one fighting week. The army had no commissary organized on a campaign
scale. We had the strength of a giant but no way of using it effectively. The President .hastened
preparations to put the country on a war footing, and even with his prudence and experience
brought to bear on the situation, Congress precipitated the collision before everything was ready
Looking back at it one is surprised that there were not more frauds .than were charged, and the
country may congratulate itself that we came through as well as we did, and that there was not
more fire kindled by such feuds as that between Alger and Miles.
Great Britain, with her army almost constantly in action and with commissary and trans
port service always on a war footing, has had exactly the same experience in the Transvaal war
Parliament had^hardly met when the House of Commons rang with charges against members of
the Ministry, who were accused of speculating on the necessities of the country.
The use to be made of the seemly or unseemly controversy is for the people of both coun
tries to see in it the intense demoralization of war, and set their faces against the spirit which
makes war wantonly. \ ;
AGAIN, CANNED BEEF.
THE old question of putting all the insane and correctional institutions under one board of
control is again mooted.
Such a board can be made very useful to the State if it take over the work of the present
ex-officio Board of Examiners. Indeed, this is of such business importance to the State that we
believe it would be better to leave each institution under control of its local board of directors or
trustees, and give to the new board of control and audit supervisory jurisdiction over them all.
The Board of Examiners at present exercises such authority, but it is composed of state of
ficers, whose time is fully taken up with their regular duties, who get no extra compensation for
the extra work imposed, and therefore feel it as a burden, while they accept it as a duty.
It is believed by students of the philosophy of the treatment of the defective and incorrigible
classes that institutions for such treatment should have in their directory persons with some
knowledge of the classes of people who are in the care of the State. This implies that on such
boards there should be some men who are not only business men but something besides. Some of
them, if in charge of an insane asylum, should have sympathetic knowledge on the subject of insan
ity, so that they may know why some things are done and why others are omitted. The same
may be said of the State schools for juvenile correction and reform. That is a specialty, requiring
the greatest knowledge of human nature, of juvenile psychology and training. The qualities re
quired in the manager of such an institution are equal to those of the president of a great univer
sity. Yet as a rule men are appointed to such institutions who have had no previous experience,
but are chosen as a reward for party service, or because they need the job. If there are members of
the directory who know the history, the literature, of juvenile correction and reform, 'they are a
safeguard against such abuse of the managerial position.
The members of the Legislature who have the matter of a general board of control undercon
sideration very naturally look at the business side of it entirely. It is very desirable that that side should
be considered, for the State demands economy. Butit demands also a clean and skillful administration
which takes charge of the helpless and unfortunate. If the economic side of the matter is regarded
as all there is of it, the humane side will fall into neglect, and the institutions themselves will cease
to serve the purpose for which they were created. Take our five insane asylums as an example.
They are generally used in the argument for a general board of control. The test of their business
administration is the total cost per capita of the inmates of the five institutions. The last informa
tion we had on that subject, the insane of this State, in our five asylums, each with its separate
board of directors, cost the taxpayers less per capita than insane management cost in Iowa, Illinois,
Wisconsin or New York.
It will be well, therefore, to look deeply into the matter before jumping at conclusions from
the business side of the problem. We, are not aware that putting- all State institutions of one or
several classes under one management has ever resulted in the economies that were expected, or
mar. tne administrative efficiency nas been enhanced thereby.
CHARITIES AND CORRECTIONS.
THE following brief retrospect of the
principal astronomical discoveries of
the nineteenth century shows that the
heavens have not been forgotten In
the many-sided capacities of the age.
Advances in physical science. Instru
mental Improvements and widespread ob
servation have enabled It to preserve a
fitting pace with the two previous centu
ries, when an almost unexplored heaven
unfolded new wonders to every telescopic
survey. Im proved methods, revised data
and widened scope have retained mathe
matical astronomy in a creditable state
of activity, with which the names of
Ganss and Bessel are pre-eminently
linked. Tho application of photography
to sky scenes has led to most valuable
discoveries, and the science of astrophy
sics, with all its startling facts and pos
sibilities, is ajso exclusively a growth of
the nineteenth century.
Commencing with the sun, to us the
most delightful of all the heavenly orbs,
we find that in the days of Herschel it
was supposed to be a cool, dark body en
sheathed in two luminous atmospheres.
This theory, upheld by several eminent
authorities, accounted for the aspect of
sun spots very satisfactorily, but accord
ing to the laws of terrestrial physics,
more fully understood later on. it would
be impossible for a body to retain a cool
condition under such circumstances. Two
thirds of the nineteenth century were
passed before the spectroscopio investiga
tions of Kirchhoff and the theories of
Faye. Secchl and a few other physicists
led to the general conviction that the sun
throughout is a globe of incandescent
gas; that under the enormous pressure of
outer layers the nucleus is of extraor
dinary density, while beyond the photo
sphere, or visible surface, lighter and
cooler gaseous strata cause the dark ab
sorption lines in its spectrum, and per
haps also the darkness of the sun spots.
With regard to these latter phenomena
more accurate data as to rotation, distri
bution and periodicity were obtained. The
portentous co-operation of solar activity
with magnetic ' disturbance and displays
of the aurora borealls was noted and es
tablished, but the cause of the sun spot
remains a mystery to the century's close.
Light analysis, though discovered in
1672, underwent its most important devel
opments within the last fifty years, when
It was proved that the different kinds of
matter of which an incandescent body Is
composed may be identified by means of
the lines In Its spectrum. In this marvel
ous way about thirty-seven of the con
stituents of the sun have been recognized
as well-known earthly elements, iron and
hydrogen being particularly conspicuous.
The prominences and the corona, though
known for ages as eclipse phenomena,
were first proved to be solar appendages
by means of photography, the former in
I860 and the latter eleven years later. The
gaseous nature of the prominences was
revealed by the spectroscope In 1SC3, and
also the advantageous discovery that
they could be viewed even when the sun
Is uneclipsed. In the year following gas
eous lines on a faint continuous back
ground were seen in the spectrum of the
corona, a green ray yet unidentified being
chiefly noticeable; but the added evidence
of future eclipses is required to fully es
tablish the suspected relation of sun spot
periodicity and the form and distribution
of coronal streamers. The vapors of the
chromosphere, also much studied during
recent years, are supposed to furnish tho
brief glow of bright lines seen just before
and after totality, but conclusive mani
festations of this reversing layer and its
true significance seem to be reserved for
the coming century.
The distance of the sun, though known
with some accuracy even before 1SS0, has
long evaded the exact measurement de
sirable In such an important problem,
but there Is much likelihood that the sys
tematic efforts of the principal observa
tories to find the parallax of the asteroid
Eros during the past months will result
in a more accurate estimate of the dimen
sions of tho solar system than was be
fore attainable.
The gradual discovery of asteroids, of
which more than 500 are now known, com
menced on the 1st of January-, 1801, and
though few are smaller none are more im
portant than Eros, which, excepting the
earth's satellite, comes nearer than any
other planetary member of the solar sys
tem. The greatest achievement In this
line, however, was tho discovery of the
planet Neptune September 23. 1S46. Its
history Is too well known to bo repeated,
but the mathematical skill of Leverrier
and Adams in computing its unseen posi
tion will long remain a standard instance
of theoretical astuteness. Its satellite,
the first found moon of the century, was
eeen seventeen days afterward by Las
sell. The following is a list of moons
since discovered through the zeal of the
eminent astronomers whose names are
annexed:
Hyperion, eighth Saturnlan moon;
Bond, Cambridge, United States, 1S4S.
Umbriel and Ariel, Uranian system;
Lassoll, England, 1851.
Two moons of Mars; Hall, Washington,
1S77.
Jupiter's fifth satellite: Barnard. Lick
Observatory, 1S92.
The existence of the supposed ninth
satellite of Saturn is not as yet fully veri
fied.
The dusky ring of Saturn, though pic
tured and described in previous centuries,
was certainly unknown as an annular ap
pendage until discovered as such In 1S30
by Bond of Cambridge. The meteoric na
ture of the ring system, suspected by
Casslnl, was theoretically demonstrated
by Clerk Maxwell in 1S3S and spectro
scopically proved in 1&>5 by the late Pro
fessor James E. Keeler.
A strange network of faint lines known
as canals, seen by Schiaparelll in 1S77, on
the surface of Mars is now fully accepted
as a unique feature of planetary topogra
phy. On Jupiter's disk an enormous red
spot appeared In 1878 and though possessed
of more permanence than the belt di
versities it has decreased In tint and size
during the past few years. That the rota
tions ' of Mercury and , Venus take place
in about the same time as their revolu
tions was announced by Schiaparelli in
1888-89 and has since been confirmed by
observers at the Lowell Observatory,
Flagstaff, Ariz. Finally, as our earth is
within the sun's domain, the detection
of a small periodic variation in latitude,
caused by the changing position of its
axis with regard to its own structure and
surface, may be added to the list of plan
etary details.
Within the last hundred vears twenty
three bright comets have visited the solar
system and over two hundred of merely
telescopic visibility. The large number of
the latter,' which does not include periodic
comets, is chiefly due to such indefatiga
ble observers as Pons, Tempel, Barnard
and Brooks. g * .
The disruption of cometary bodies !n
the. seeming solitudes of space, the fact
that one orbit may be a. thoroughfare for
several, appearing: singly at - long inter
vals, the still more extraordinary discov
ery that a comet may share its pathway
with a meteoric swarm and the identill
catlon of such familiar substances as car
bon in cometary s"pe<:tra. are among the
most interesting advances of recent dec
ades. . f
.Belief in the cosmical nature of me
teoric bodies was revived and fully estab
lished in 1S33. when tne stimulus of un
wonted star! showers led to researches of
much value. The. recognition of a peri
odic recurrence, a toiler knowledge of
their motions, genertj .characteristics
and chemical constituents may be accred
ited to the succeeding forty years. Many
Â«minant ' .rcamgy notahlv ; thosa of H, A,
Newton and Schiaparelll. are> connected
with tha progress In this branch of cos
mlcal Inquiry, which has resulted In a
singular Insight into the possibilities of
Interplanetary space.
The far dim depths beyond tho solar
system have also signally developed tha
acumen of the nineteenth century mind.
The vast subject of stellar remoteness
again and again defied investigation until
Bessel, In 1SSS, detected with the newly
devised hellometer the parallax of O
Cygnl, which corresponded with a dis
tance 600.000 times that of the sun from
the earth. The parallaxes of more than
fifty stars have been since obtained, and
â¢while two only are found to be somewhat
nearer, the remainder are far more re
mote. That there Is no uniformity as to
distance or size, and that brightness is
not always an evidence of nearness arÂ»
among the disclosures of this great work.
Previous to 1S01 hundreds of double
stars were known, bnt through the re
searches of Strove, Burnham and a few
others more than 12.000 have been added
to (he list: meanwhile the pairs classed as
binary systems have Increased five fold.
That there Is still a field for exploration
is shown by the valuable double star
work recently done at the Uck Observa
tory and elsewhere.
Stellar variability, long known in a fe^r
cases, has been assiduously studied In
late years, and about 400 variables arÂ«
now under constant observation. Amonar
them may be classed the "new stars'*
seen visually or photographically, whose*
minima is sometimes probably beyond the
reach of telescopic power. Elaborate Im
provements In spectroscoplc apparatus
have lured stellar light Into a display of
its constituents, yielding much Informa
tion as to color, variations of spectra and
probable temperature.
In the star spectrograph choice efforts
of photography and spectrcscopy arÂ»
united for the detection of motion in ths
lino of sight. The predominating motions
as to the solar system are thus under In
vestigation. Foremost In equipment and
results is the Lick Observatory, and while
an Important increase of knowledge la
Impending, no forecast as to what It may
be Is yet possible. In the process of this
sublime research it has come to light that
about thirty stars, seemingly single In all
telescopes, are composed of two bodies re
volving in very short periods, probably
around a common center of gravity.
Herschel found that the heavens are
strewn with thousands of nebulae, and
suspected that many are not of a etarry
nature. The great telescopes of the
present century added several thousand
more to the number, and as early as 1S63
Muggins confirmed the theory of a non
stellar constitution by means of the spec
troscope. About half the entire number
arc now classed as masses of luminous
gas. Efforts to determine motion In the>
line of sight were unavailing' until Pro
fessor Keeler with the vtmal spectro
scope of the Lick Observatory found that
some are advancing and some receding
with various degrees of velocity, a most
important addition to otxr knowledge of
cosmlcal harmony.
The progress of astronomical knowledges
by means of the spectroscope is rivaled
only by the dazzling: deeds of thÂ» phot
graphic telescope. Various as to size and
form. It pictures the sun, the moon, tha
unseen star, the growing comet, tha fad
ing variable, the convoluted nebula, while
faint cosmic lights that human vision
can never behold betray their tangling
folds on the magio plate; and piecemeal
the entire firmament Is beingr portrayed
for the enlightenment of future ages.
Notwithstanding the extent and sublim
ity of these advances It devolves on com
ing years to wreath new laurels for tha
dying century, when Its labors uncom
pleted bear fruit, and Its theories as yet
unproved assume the luster of sdentlSo
fact. V-

permission at ence In the right Quarter;

In 1EW Mr. Miller decided that the work
at the Empire Theater offered nothing
that would tend further to advance him
in his profession, so he determined to try
starring. Klein & Clarke's "Heartsease"
was his first play. Concerning tho merits
of that much bepatched compositionâ the
only good act of which was written by
Mr. Miller himself â I have already ex
pressed myself bo enthusiastically that I
may be pardoned for passing It m r er hers.
â¢ â¢ â¢ No San Franciscan who loves
what is best and most beautiful in his
trionic art can forget Mr. Miller's three
weeks' season at the Baldwin In 1SSS,
where with but one good play out of the
three presented he managed so to charm
his public that they were glad to welcome
him for a ten weeks' season In 1S39, and
for another ten weeks last cummer. It Is
literally true that for three-quarters of
the theatrical performances worth seeing
given during the last three years we are
indebted to Mr. Miller. No better Betting
than he gave his plays is to be seen either
in London or in Paris, nor has any actor
manager ever kept better faith with his
public than has he. His much-to-be-re
gretted illness soon after leaving San
Francisco was due to his insisting upon
Â¦working here for six weeks after he
should have canceled all engagements and
gone south for rest.
It is an open secret that Mr. Miller and
Mr. Frohman have parted company. That
is a good thing:â for Mr. Miller. He will
now be free to follow the lines along
which his artistic Instinct and his ambi
tion for perfection lead him. He will do
even better things in the future than he
has done in the past, and he will not need
to be "presented" to his public by any
body.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Miller's biography is the worst-writ
ten in Mr. Strang's book; that is because
much of it w*as written by Franklyn Fyles
of Ladies' Home Journal fame. The best
written are the biographies of Richard
Mansfield and of "William Faversham;
that Js because these biographies were
written largely by those gentlemen them
selves. Mansfield's account contains a
story that shows up W. S. Gilbert in a
light pitiably mean. Gilbert engaged
Mansfield to play the leading part in
"Pinafore" for the megniflcent remuner
ation of $15 per week. Three years he
worked for this pittance; at the end of
that time he asked Gilbert for a slight
Increase in pay AND "WAS REFUSED.
â¢ â¢ â¢ In a manner at once frank and
modest Mr. Faversham tells a story of his
early struggles that ie well worth reprint
ing here for the benefit of any man. artist
or no artist, who complains that the world
does not give him a living:
"At that time I was almost a stranger
here. I had no money. I had possibly
earned $20 a week and the long vacation
was before me. I gave up my modest
room at the hotel and for a few weeks
lived as best I could, selling what few
things I had that could be sold. I finally
had nothing left but my dog. Sambo, a
famous bull. Every one knows Sambo..
"Finally I made up my mind that I
must get work. One day I took my dog
and walked up Harlcmway until I reached
High Bridge. I stood watching the men
at work until it occurred to me that I
might get something like that to do. I
went up to a man who seemed to be an
overseer and asked him if there was any
work around that a fellow might get to
do.
"I suppose I had a very British accent,
for the man laughed outright and mim
icked me as he replied that there was
work to be had, but he doubted if I was
the man to do it. 1 explained that the
truth of the matter was, I had never done
anything of the sort before, but that I
was broke and wanted to get through the
summer.
"He tent for a fellow named Tom Pil
grim. I'll never forget him. He was tho
plumber pipe layer. Pilgrim took Â»me
home with him and taught me his trade.
In four days I could "wipe a joint" like
an old hand. I worked all that summer.
I used to get up at half-past 4. get to
work at 6, put in my ten hours a day,
earn my S3 or $10 a week. Bleep as I had
never slept in my life, and eat my bread
and cheese with an appetite and a relish
that I have vainly eought to duplicata
ever since. I might never have aban
doned that life and returned to acting
but for an accident.
"I had friends living not far awav â
Tremont avenue. One day I was lying
out on the grass looking up at the sky
with Sambo by my <side, when this fam
ily drove by. Sambo was too well known.
I heard a voice I knew call out my name.
J took to my heels as a natural impulse
and dodged behind a house. My pursuer
went the other way. We met.
"There was nothing for it then but to
make a clean breast of the whole thing.
Such a weeping and wailing you never
heard. Why didn't I tell them my fls?
How could I do such a thins? No one
seemed to understand at all except the
old gentleman, who said, 'No, by jove, it's
the proper thing. It won't hurt him. a
bit' It didn't; it did me good. But, of
course, now I was discovered. I had to
go back to civilization."
That old gentleman was right. Bravo,
Faversham! That was better than being
an actor; that was being a man.
THERE Is only one "famous" Ameri
can actor to-dayâ Joseph Jefferson.
Not to know this argues either one
self unknown or a blissful Ignorance
of the meaning of words. On the
j.câ .Â« cf this dilemma sits Lewis C.
Etrang, who ha*= discovered no leas than
twenty-five distinguished actors (there
have rot been eo many since the begin
ning of Cenotoic times), and has rushed
into print with his discovery; entitling it
"Famous Actors of the Day in America"
(Page, Boston). â¢ â¢ â¢ Among these
"famous" are cuch intellectual giants as
James X. Hackett, Robert B. Mantell and
Herbert Kelcey! Shades of Betterton,
Uoliere, Garrick, Talma and Booth! If
these fumers and fretters of a petty hour
are famous, what are ye? Immortal? Bet
terton, not yet dead two hundred years, is
all but forgotten, and Talma., of our own
center}', is remembered only as the favor
ite actor of Napoleon.
If we omit Joseph Jefferson as con
fessedly "famous." of the twenty-four
other subjects of Mr. Stracg"B biographies
it cannot truthfully be eaid that more
than five have attained more than a pro
vincial reputation. These five are James
A. Hern*, Richard Mansneld. John Drew,
}Â»'at Goodwin and Henry Miller. I 6hall
take up principally the life of Mr. Miller;
for us he possesses a local Interest that
cannot attach to the others, since it is
cwic^r to him. as a local writer has well
eaid, that San Francisco has become once
more anything but a epeck on the theatri
cal map. â¢ â¢ â¢ In the following account
I have supplemented Mr. Str&ng's meager
fietal^B with information from a source
to which It is tviflent he had but scanty
access.
Mr. Miller, who was once seriously ac
cused by Miss Geraldine Bonner of speak
ing American with an English accent, wu
born !n London. He comes of a family
thtt had no theatrical associations what-
Btrtver; It is doubtful !f his father was
ever in a playhouse in his life. Young
Miller knew little and cared less about
the theater until one day. Just after Irv
ing had made his hit as Matthias in "The
Eells," he happened to read in a news
paper an account of that actor's early
EtruÂ£Â£>Â£ and long: deferred, well deserved
success. This inspired him with a desire
to see what kind of place a tneater was.
He went, he saw and was overcome. He
h*gzn to study with Couldock, the Shakes
pearean reader, and at the age of 19 made
bis debut in a Toronto stock company,
playing the part of the sergeant in "Mac
beth." Tet in spite of the excellence of
that impersonation "Macbeth" as a pro
duction did net take a strong hold upon
the affections of Toronto audiences. Tues
day nights never failed to come, but the
ghost often failed of his eagerly expected
perambulations. The senior members of
the Toronto rtock company left one by
one for freeb^r woois and pastures newer;
thus for those Juniors, who could live on
little or nothing, promotion was inevita
ble. By the end of the season Mr. Miller
found that he had risen from general
utility to leading Juvenile; but I think he
boarded at home.
The year 1S7S saw Mr. Miller beginning
again, in Modjeska's company, as gen
eral utilityâ a class of roles he chared
with Robert Mar.tell. Mantell had been
en the stage longer than Miller and re
ceived J30 a week to Miller's 520.
"The most absorbing problem in life to
me at that time," he has told me, "was
to discover why Mantell got $10 a week
more than I did. and how he did it. If I
could only get $30 a week. I felt I was
made for life." I think that Mr. Miller
roust have discovered the secret and that
llantell must have lost It, for with the
exception of Mr. Jefferson end Mr. Mana
Â£eld, there Is no one that stanis higher
in Ms profession to-day than does the im
personator of Sydney Carton, while poor
Mantellâ alael poor Mantell! As an ar
tist he has been dead these ten years.
Like bo many- actors who have since
become svart. Mr. Miller has been through
the echocl o-f Daly, but like all really
elrcng men he could not remain long un
cer the tutelage of that most domineering
cf personalities. His most noteworthy
performance while a member of the Daly
company was that of the leading part in
Odette (1&2). "When Daniel Frohman or
ganized the Lyceum Stock Company, Mr.
Miller became leading- man. These were
the days of the Bentlmenta.1 (Jrawlnf-room
dramas, such as "The Wife" and "Sweet
Lavender"â plays eo intolerably wishy-
T.ashy that it seems to me a considerable
achievement for any. actor to be able to
hold an audience hi the theater with
them. Mr. Miller did. this and more; he
actually made the audiences believe that
"The Wife." "Sweet Lavender," et id
oame genus were good plays, and from
the wretched materials furnished him
< chiefly) by De ilille he built up a solid
reputation as an excellent actor. He has
done many good things since, but he has
r.ever done anything more remarkable
than that.
When the Empire Theater was opened
In Xew York Mr. illller joined the. stock
company there and for some years shared
â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Ith Jliss Viola Allen the honors of that
excellent organization. During this time
he \ras fortunate in having some fine
roles, notably that of Frederic Lemaltre
Jn the one-act play of that name, and
that of David Rernon in "The Masquerad
ers." About this time he had that humor
ous encounter with Sir Henry Irving

The German law of libel is a curiosity.
An editor recently said in his paper that
a certain gentleman "was an unmannerly
boor," In consequence of which a libel ac
tion was brought against the paper. The
evidence given seemed to show that the
only fault with the expression was that
it was not strong enough. The case was
taken from court to court in the usual
way, until it reached the highest tribunal
The final decision was that the editor
would have been perfectly justified If he
had said that the plaintiff "had acted like
an unmannerly boor," but since he had
eaid that the plaintiff actually "was an
unmannerly boor," -he had committed li
bel. In Germany It is libelous ; to call a
man a pig: or an ass; but if you combine

His Resignation.
WASHINGTON, Dec 23.âAdministra

a prompt settlement of the Chinese ques
tion should Minister Conger resign. No
confirmation of his reported Intention,
which it Is said he has communicated to
friends, has been received here, and the
understanding ;n official circles seems to
be that he proposes to remain. Mr. Con
ger has reported that in sf-veral Important
lnptanc^s he' hap acted contrary to in
structions sent him. and the administra
tion has not hesitated to call his attention
to this fact. The report which said he
intended to rpsign gave as its cause fric
tion between him and the State Depart
ment. Officials say .this friction arose
from Mr. Conor's failure to properly
carry out instruction.
Thore would Ye no hesitancy on the part
of thp administration about accepting Mr.
Conger's resignation. He was driven to
understand several months ago that If he
desired a leave it would be granted him,
but he preforrfd to remain at his post.
It is thought here that he will 1 insist
upon remaining until the negotiations
with the Chinese envoys are concluded.
As the conclusion may not be reached for
months it looks as if Mr. Conger, sup
ported by missionary and Congressional
influence, would remain In office during
the second administration.
HONORS A SON OF TAUN.
Empress Dowager's Choice for Buler
of the Chinese Empire.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 29.â Some months
apo the Empress Dowager of China desig
nated the young son of Prince Tuan as
the successor of Kwang Su. Although the
name given in the dispatches as that of
the new successor differs from that
named by the Empress Dowager some
time ago, they may be one and the same,
as imperial names refer to the dynasties
and change upon appointment to the
throne, that of Kwang Su being different
from the name he bore before he ascend
ed the throne. Should the change be
confirmed, it would doubtless be regarded
by the powers as a hiph handed act and
one not likely to be countenanced.
In the present condition of affairs such
a procedure by the Empress Dowager
would be an offense against China as well
as the powers. Under the ancient system
of China, the Emperor Is able to name his
successor, at times going outside-of the
Imperial family, although under the pres
pnt dynasty it has been the custom to
designate the son and heir as successor,
or. in the absence of a son. to select a
member of the Imperial family. Kwang
Count von Waldersee Reports a Feat by a De;achment of the
Third Asiatic in the Mountains Near Mancheng.
to
Su is the nephew of the former Emperor,
who had no sons and designated the
youthful nephew to succeed him. But in
the reeont disturbed conditions of the em
pire, the ancient usages appear to have
been lost sight of and In September, 1898.
the Empress Dowager executed a coup
d'etat and took the reins of government
into her own hands, practically displac
ing the Emperor. Later the Empress
Dowager named the young son of Prince
Tuan as the successor to the throne, and
now, according to press dispatches, the
Empress Dowager has displaced the Em
peror with a new successor.
The previous acts of the En. press Dow
ager have not been such as would permit
intervention by the powers, although the
Emperor has made appeals to Great Brit
ain and other countries to uphold his an
cient prerogative*. But. with the powers
operating in China, it is not likely that
they will permit a further exercise of the
Empress Dowager's influence, particular
ly If It takes the obnoxious form of seek
ing to confer power on a son of Prince
Tuan, the chief conspirator In the Boxer
disturbances. Besides the specific de
mands made by the powers on China. It
is well known that the Governments and
their Ministers to Peking have for somo
time been considering moans of overcom
ing the sinister anti-foreign Influence of
the Empress Dowager by excluding her
from Peking and from all further partici
pation of the governmental affairs of
China.
China Not Expected to Blindly Agree
to the Demands.
DELAYS MAY BE PROLONGED.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â It is recog
nized by the officials here as a perfectly
natural course on the part of the Chinese
Government to ask for explanations of
the Important points in the agreement
reached by the Ministers at Peking, Â«j
the President is not surprised to hear now
that before blindly accepting the agree
ment as binding upon it the Chinese court
wishes for some definite statement as to
what Chinese cities are to be occupied,
how long the occupation is to continue,
whether it is an absolute, condition thaÂ»
the Princes are to be beheaded an.f
whether the Taku forts are to be razed
or whether dismantlement will suf
fice. It is^a fact that our Government
has from the beginning of the negotia
tions taken an attitude on these fivÂ«?
points of Inquiry closely corresponding to
that which it is supposed the Chinese
Oovernment has assumed as a .basis of
putting them. '
It begins to appear from the character
of the Chinese responses that there mav
ne more time consumed in securing a final
acceptance of the agreement than was at
first expected. It was not to be supposed
that the allies, In/view of their union
upon the use of the word "irrevocable."
as applied to the agreement, would toler
ate unnecessary delay on the part of the
Chinese Government in acting upon the
agreement, but the inquiries made ap
pear to be so reasonable, at least in the
eyes of our Government, that there can
scarcely be a valid objection to their con
sideration.

board. It was half-past 3 when I got to
the hock plant and the race was due at
4.- I started to yank tile ring off when I
found that It wouldn't remove. In hit
ting my welching friend the night before
I had bruised up my Knuckles and they
were swollen. I wa3 in a big hurry and I
moistened the finger and twisted the ring
around, but it baiked at the knuckie.
Then the man behind the desk tried to
twist it off, but it was no go. I hustled
out to the corner drug store and bought
a bottle of vaseline, chased back to the
pawnshop, stuck the finger in the vase
line bottle, and then tried to entice it oft.
But the knuckle was still about a twen
tieth of an inch too big and the ring's
always been a close fit, anyhow, and I
was losing time *o fast that I began to
calcine around the neckband.
"I was just about to pass the word to
the man behind the counter to chop tho
ringer err, or file the ring off, or some
thing, when I gave thp three-stoner the
kind of a do-good twist it needed and off
It came. Then it was four minutes of 4,
and when I got the $30 and the ticket It

if they had half a mind to give me the

swung some old lady for her purse, but
I kept right on and ,'inally made the stain,
of the room. Just as I passed the look

duck behind the window, and I recognizpd
his voice. I stooped. down and looked in.
and I saw the marks' of my thr*Â»e-stoner
still red and raw on his chin. He was my
welching boy.
" 'It's all off for that $30 you owe me.'
I said to him. 'if you get this $30 down

hadn't yet called off the way the horses

which was at 40 to 1. and before I ha.1
a chance to butt in and say that I wanted
to put $10 all three ways on The Rogue
the operator chimt-d in and announced
that The Rogue was third and only a

ment of the United States and the
Government of Denmark have been
in progress, 'though intermittently,
for the last two ! years. In the
earlier stages something was attempt
ed here through the resident Min
ister of Denmark, Constantin Bruen,
and one Captain Christmas Dlrkfeldt, but
while these efforts laid the foundation for
what followed in Europe they could not
be regarded as successful, and after ma
ture consideration the State Department
decided that Mr. Swenson, the United
States Minister to Denmark, was the best
person to deal with the case. In the inter
est of this country. Therefore he was
given full instructions and some measure
of authority. He had nearly succeeded in
his object last sprlntr when, through an
internal change in Denmark, the- Minister
of- Foreign Affairs was displaced.
The new Minister was opposed to the
transfer of the Islands to the United
States and a wave of patriotic feeling
swept over the country to which the Gov
ernment was obliged to yield, and the ne
gotiations were suspended for a time.
Now a change has taken place In the pub-
Hcjnind of Denmark and the present Min
ister of Foreign Affairs has. ft is believed
here, reluctantly come to the conclusion
that for financial reasons it is scarcely
necessary to hold the islands. Their ex
pert trade, normally done in large part
with the United States, has been greatly
depressed, and though the commerce
might yield sufficient taxation under un
restrained intercourse with the United
States to make the islands self-sustain
ing, at present they are a drag on Den
mark and the Danish Government is
obliged to make good a considerable de
ficit on their account.
According to a correspondent, two mag
nificent carpets, presented by the Infanta
Donna. Sanche to the royal convent of St.
Antonio in 1500, have Just been cold by
auction at the municipal chamber in Lis
bon to pay for repairs at the convent and
church. The sale of the carpets, which
Â¦were Persian, about eighteen feet square,
embroidered with real gold, caused much
excitement. The most eager bidders were
two groups, French and German, and the
Frenchmen secured : the prize for $S99O,
which is regarded as nearly $5000 below
the real value.
"Yes," said the 'bookmaker's sheet
writer, who is waiting for the spring
meeting at Aqueduct to begin, "I sure am
resting just now; but I don't know; 1
guess I'll be able to give 'em an argu
ment for Christmas oats and a candy cane
slicking out of the Santa Claus sock be
sides," whereupon the resting sheet
writer paid for the arinks for the crowd
around the table from a roll of the brown
ones that he was only able to pull out
of his righthand trousers pocket by
stooping over. The others at the table,
at sight of the bundle, simulated sudden
attacks of heart disease, vertigo and oth
er prostrating seizures. The sheetwriter
with the wealth stooped over and returned
the rubber-banded wad to his righthand
trousers pocket, beamed cheerfully upon
the open-eyed party of five around the
table, lit a fresh cigar and went on:
"A couple o' weeks ago, when I got
back from Bennings with the old man, it
looked like a case o' hustle for a winter
job as a sweepout for mine. It was by
way o' Glasgow for me. Tne Washington
gang of pikersâ and they weren't such
pikers at that -this yearâ chased the old
man oft the block inside of a week, and
when he turned his slate they had his
$MW0 roll in their pajamas. You people
may have heard that out of the forty and
odd. layers who went on the stools at the
opening of tnis last Bennings meeting only
fourteen stayed the route, and these were
staggering and all out at the iinisn. When
the old man's satchel was cleaned out,
that let me out of work, of course, and
the little $200'that I went down to Wash
ington with, intending to bloat the same
into a leather trust, was by that time
snugged away in the kicks of the Gov
ernment clerk's shortclothes; and I had
all I could do to spade out enough to buy
a ticket back to New York. When you're
playing second and third choices and the
long ones against a game that totaled
up about 60 per cent of favorites, like
that Bennings meeting did, you're due
to fall off and break yourself into a pic

- "New York is such a nice little old place
to come back to when you've bowed a
tendon and there's nothing doingâ with
the copper on. For a couple o' days cof
fee and sinker dough looked as big as the
figurehead of a ship to me. I did the
hustle around the rooms to see if I
couldn't nail some pencil work, but it was
nix all along the line; crews all filled up
and the clammy digits everywhere. 1
didn't want to send this three-stoner that
I'm wearing up the eaves, feeling that it
ought to stick as part of the front, but
my No.-2. benny went in for a bum seven
spot. - On the day that I put my overcoat
in I met a duck on Forty-second street
that's been owing me 530 since last Au
gustânot $30 in milk tickets or rain
checks, but sure-enough money; he hand
ed me the hurry touch for it at the track
one afternoon. When I met him 1 held
out my hand and let out a slight cough.
He didn't show that he was wise to my
pantomime, however, and so I mildly re
quested him to â¢ produce. ; He was diked
out in all the glad. ribbons fit to wear, and
a rock in his puff tie at that, but he told
me he didn't have the $30 on him, but said
he'd meet me that night on a Broadway
corner and pass it out to me. I was on
the corner on time, but the tin horn with
my thirty bucks wasn't. He didn't turn
up at all, although 1 waited an hour for
him, and when I faded away I ; had my
mind made up to tap him one on the
crust for luck theininute I saw. him. I
ran into him on the next night, when I
only had $4 left out of the $7 that I'd got
on : mv understudy blanket. He tried to
thread the crown- when he saw me, but I
got to him and, said a few words of war
medicine; whereupon he began to snap
gteel chains with his chest. There was
only one thing to do. I'm left handed and
I gave him^ that one right on the chin

corner gave : me the' arm-clutch, and It

NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â The Tribune has
the following from Washington: The prac
tical conclusion of negotiations for the
purchase of the Danish West Indies is
virtually confirmed at the State De
partment in the announcement that
an appropriation by Congress is
all that remains to provide for
the acquisition of St. Thomas and other
small Islands owned by Denmark Imme
diately to the eastward of Porto Rico, and
it is the Impression of the officials that
the money will be voted next month. The
greatest difficulty encountered in the ne
gotiations has been the reluctance of
Denmark to agree in advance to a sale,
while the United States was not prepared
to guarantee to buy, fearing a repetition
of the embarrassing situation that arose
thirty years ago, when the Senate refused
to ratify Secretary Seward's treaty of
purchase, when Denmark believed the sale
had actually been consummated.
It Is the understanding that a canvass
of Consrress shows that Senator Lodge's
bill, carrying $5,000,000 for the acquisition
of the islands and for establishing Ameri
lcan sovereignty. Is assured of speedy and
favorable consideration, and on this as
surance, all preliminaries to the treaty
and transfer have been perfected and the
signing of the instrument only awaits the
readiness of the United to pay the pur
chase price.
COPENHAGEN, Dec. 29.â The United
States Minister, Mr. . Swenson, has In
formed the Danish Government that the
United States offers 12,000.000 kroner for
the Danish Antilles and will not give
more.
The negotiations between the Govern-
LUCK TURNED
JUST IN TIME
"The home of social and economic ex
periments" in the name given by some
writers to isolated New Zealand. It has
also been described as "labor's paradise,"
for in no other quarter of the civilized
world has so much been attempted in' the
way of social reform and state Interven
tion in the interest of the p'oor and lowly,
says Edward JB. Clarke in the Chicago
Times-Herald. New Zealand is therefore
a democracy which may be studied with
profit by those .who would form an idea
of the tendencies of unrestricted popular
rule and the effects of what is called'pop
ulism among us and what is in reality a
mild form of socialism, is New ZeaJand
a warning or an example? Ooes it teach
how to do it or how not to do it?
Not a few have described for our benefit
special acts or policies of the New Zea
land democracy, but the most complete
and satistactory account of the politics
and legislation of that interesting colony
for the past decade has just been provided
by. Henry J. Lloyd in .a work entitled
"Newest England." Mr. Lloyd is in full
sympathy with the dominant tendances In
New Zealand, and he writes with enthusi
asm of the things done, proposed and
planned by the radical i party now in
power. Yet he is compelled to make some
admissions which, to the impartial stu
dent, will appear most suggestive.
Let it be premised that nttie New Zea
land commands admiration for its bold
ness and self-confldence. it has had the
courage of its ideas. Thus the latest ven
ture on its part is universal penny post
age. It has decided on this regardless of
tne "aid or consent of any foreign na
tion," not excepting the mother country.
It asks for no reciprocal benefits. It be
lieves that penny postage will pay event
ually because it will quicken and increase
correspondence and trade, and it is eager
to act on that belief. I'.ie same readiness
has been shown in other and more ques
tionable directions. Here is a list of the
reforms instituted by New Zealand since
1890, the year of the "peaceful revolution"
and the extraordinary wave of political
radicalism which abolished the "ancient
regime" and swept the conservatives out
of powerâ forever, we are assured: ,
1. Abolition of general property tax and
substitution therefor of land and income
taxes to force the large land-owner to
sell his holding. The tax on the rich Is
progressive and high; the poor is largely
exempted. .
2. A great step is taken toward the abo
lition of private property in lands. The
state becomes a landlord, establishes a
new tenure, lease in perpetuity, and limits
transfer, area and cultivation.
3. Contract work is done away with, and
the government undertakes direct con
struction of all public buildings, improve
ments, "etc.
4. Compulsory arbitration is established
and strikes are eliminated. All disputes
are settled by a court specially created for
the purpose, regardless of ail considera
tions of free contract and free private
enterprise.
6. Unemployed are taken care of on a
state farm.
6. Transportation at cost Is adopted as
the government's railway policy.
7. The principal bank of the colony Is
"nationalized." and the government as
sumes the role of chief purveyor of credit
to the business interests.
8. Pensions are given to all aged poor.
9. Free cold storage is provided; patents
are bought up and made free to all; boun
ties are paid for the development of new
industries, and instruction is given by the
government agents in co-operative pro
duction.
10. Women are enfranchised.
Some of the reforms have been in effect
but a short time and it may be unfair to
sit in Judgment upon them. But the ques
tion may yet be askedâ What has been
the visible result of all this "fraternalism
and paternalism?" Mr. Lloyd says in one
place that New Zealand is prosperous in
every department, and that the radical
policy is a "success." But in another
place he admits that the people are
neither happy nor content; that the work
men dare not publish the names of their
official leaders lest the employers black
list them, and that the birth rate is
steadily decreasing owning to an economic
pressure which makes people afraid to
have children. But the strongest evidence
of dissatisfaction is found in the demand
for additional and even more revolution
ary legislation.
The measures and reforms which the
progressive party advocates make a list
even longer than that of the things al
ready realized. The principal items > in
this list are: Nationalization of the coal
mines, complete nationalization of the
land, increase of the taxes for the further
equalization of the rich and poor. State
insurance against fire, nationalization of
the steamship lines, complete nationaliza
tion of banking and a government news
service. In the face of this remarkable
programme Mr. Lloyd says that "while
theorists invite the world to choose be
tween the catastrophe of state socialism
and trust socialism. New Zealand finds
a way out between tneRe extremes." What
does Mr. Lloyd understand by socialism
if all that New Zealand asks, in addition
to what it has realized, is not socialism?
The lesson really taught by. the experi
ence of the antipodean. Utopia is that
there is no "way out between," for one
step toward paternalism as practiced in
New Zealand inevitably leads to another
and another. In the end the colony will
have to choose between out-and-out so
cialism and the economic policy which it
hag discarded. The prosperity the colony
enjoys is not the consequence of its ex
perimental legislation. What will happen
under a period of industrial stagnation?
May not t the colony be confronted by
bankruptcy? -And will not the restriction
upon manufacturing industries cause in
dustrial paralysis? New Zealand will
know more ten or twenty years hence
about the soundness of tne concern called
"Government & Co., Unlimited." In the
meantime no democracy will be tempted
to emulate New Zealand's example. The
spectacle is an interesting one, but it Is
not half over. \ No congratulations such as
Mr. Lloyd extends are as yet in order.

coasts, evidence of. disasters from the
gale not yet reported.
The Great Western Railroad Company â¢
steamer plying between Milford and
Waterford, which, last night, was report
ed twelve hours overdue, reached Water
ford thirty-two hours late. The remain
der of the crew of the Spanish steamer
F.necurl, which was driven ashore at the
Portland breakwater (where twenty-two
men got ashore, leaving live men on the
wreck) have been landed. The captain
revisited the vessel to-day, and as be

a "number of fishing smacks and coasting;
vessels have been wrecked. Nine flan,
boats have been stranded near Dunkirk
end three of them will prove total wrecks.
Their crews were seen clinging to the
rigging, but the majority of them were

GOOD REASON FOR IT.
The Success and Popularity of the
New Catarrh Cure.
The remarkable success and popularity
of the new catarrh cure. Stuart Â» Catarrh
Tablets is largely because It not only-
cures catarrh, but because catarrh suf-
ferers who use these tablets know what
they are taking Into their systemsâ no bÂ«-
cret is made of what they contain. They
are composed of hydrastJn, blood root,
guaiacol and red gum, are pleasant to the
taste and, being dissolved In the mouth,
they take Immediate effect upon thÂ» mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passage*
and the whole respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets have accomplished In old chronic
cases are little short of remarkable, and
the advantage of knowing Just what you
are taking Into your system Is of para-
mount importance when It Is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using secret catarrh remedies, aa so
many of them are well known to contain
these injurious drugs.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with the
approval and cordial support of physi-
cians because their antiseptic character
renders them perfectly safe for thÂ« gen-
eral public to use and their composition
makes them a common sense cure for ail
forms of catarrhal trouble.
With nearly all advertised catarrh cures
it is a matter of guesswork as to what
you are taking Into the stomach, as the
proprietors, while making all sorts ot
claims as to what their medicines will do.
are very careful to keep it a close secret
as to what they really contain.
This 13 one reason why Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so widely recommend-
ed because they are not only pleasant and
convenient to take, but the patient also
knows he is not putting Into his stomach
anything of an injurious character.
These tablets are sold by druggists ev-
ervwhere in the United States and
Canada at 50 cents for complete treat-
ment and probably there is no better rem-
edy ever devised for the* permanent cure
of catarrh, whether located In the head,
throat, bronchial tubes or In the stomach.

A noticeable feature of the copper trade
of the present year is the relatively small
increase shown by the monthly reports of
the producers. Thus the statement of John
Stanton. who acts as statistician for the
companies, gives for the United States in
November a total output of 23,276 long
tons of fine copper, which Is only 259 tons
more than In December of last year, a
gain of 1.1 per cent. For the eleven months
ending with November the production re
ported was 24G.763 tons, which is greater
than that of the corresponding months of
last year by only 8545 tons, or 3.6 per cent.
Moreover the reporting companies showed
an actual decrease this year of 855 tons,
or 0.4 per cent. the. gain coming entirely
from the outside sourcesâ the smaller
non-reporting mines and the smelting
companies â which are credited this year
with a gain of 9400 tons, or 33.6 per cent.
It appears, therefore, that the active de
mand did not stimulate production In the
older mines, as might have been expected.
A parallel result is shown In the Impor
tant European mines, the total production
from these for the eleven months having
been 81,848 tons, or : almost exactly the
same as last year, the difference being a
decrease of 32 tons.
Indications arc that work on tbe Montezuma
mine, southeast of Big Pine, will be vigorously
pushed. A rock crusher, roller mill and five
concentrators will be put in place near the
dump. The motive power will be furnished by
a forty horsepower engine, water for which
will be pumped from a well. Pending the
erection of machinery at the mine, a number
of car loa<ls of ore will be shlppodto Seattle
for working 1 . Seven men are employed at the
mine.

In an annual review of the output of
metals In Utah, the Deseret News says
gold and copper beat all previous records.
The output of silver and lead also shows
a. marked Increase over 1899,"- the . output
of the latter being probably the greatest
production recorded In the history of the
State. The gross output *of copper for
the 'year is 14.287.877 pounds, as compared
with 9.96S.000 in 1S93. Without taking Into
account the gold shipped by the Geyser
Marion earlier in the. year, the gold out
put Is placed at 186,861 ounces, which
shows an increase of nearly 14.000 ounces,
or about J2S0.O00 over last year's report.
The output of lead last year is surpassed
this year by 4.233,664* pounds, while the
silver production exceeds last year's rec
ord by 940,792 ounces, and comes within
192.C16 ouii^es of reaching: the record- of
1S92. whlcii was the banner year for the
wMte metal In the history of Utah min
ing. The total mineral output for the
year is estimated at $21,385,649.
Tho Mariposa Gazette says:
There will be an attempt made to dredge
the bed of the Fraser River In British

John Cobbledlck to push the work.
According. to the Calaveras Chronicle
wcrk will soon be resumed on the gravel
mines of the Consolidated Gold Hill Min
ing Company. The property is about
eight miles east from Mokelumne Hill, on
Esperanza Creek, and consists of twelve
claims, about 15.000 feet in length and COO
feet wide. A certain part of the property
is in controversy.
The Sonora Union-Democrat reports
progress as follows: Sinking has been re
sumed in the Rawhide, the shaft in which
mine Is down 1700 feet. A body of ore
has been uncovered on the Tuolumne

Stevens' Bar. Operations are progress
ing at the Neale mine on Portuguese
Gulch.
The appreciating price of silver may
have the effect of starting certain silver
mines. A Colorado man, J, Wilbur. Smith
of Denver, has begun development work
upon a group of claims on the Colorado
River, forty miles from Yuma. The
Yuma Sun says he Is trying to determine
the feasibility of placing a 500-ton con
centrating plant at the mines or on the
river bank, and that If his experiments
are successful he will bond the properties.
The strike of the miners In the Long

But, unfortunately, this Is not so, and
the consequence is that the line of dawn,
as it sweeps around the earth, first
touches the date-line to the south of the
equator, and then gradually creeps up
this line till it leaves it far to the north.
So the first sun of the twentieth century
will rise on the places along or near the

IS place at either of the equinoxesâ
1 1 â nrch 22 or September 22â then, since
1L on those days the earth's axis is at
right angles to the plane of the
orbit, and there is equal day and
night all over the world, the matter
would be very easily decided. The dawn
line would coincide with the date-line, and
from pole to pole the first sun of the new
cer.tury would rise at the same moment.

Those who will be succeeded on Jan

year for which they were appointed, are
the following: Board of Public Works,
Marsden Manson; Civil Service Commis
sion P. H. McCarthy; Board of Educa
tion,' C. W. Mark; Police Commission, Dr.
W. F. McNutt; Fire Commission. M. H.
Hecht; Election Commission, A. W. Voor
sanger; Park Commission, Frederick W.
Zeile; Board of Health, Dr. Louis Bazet.
In at least one instance there is no ques
tion as to whether one of the retiring
officials will succeed himself. Dr. Bazet
in an interview.' has declared with consid
erable emphasis that he Is glad of the
opportunity to retira and says emphat
ically that the public is ungrateful.
The rumor that Mark will succeed him
self as a member of the Board of Edu
cation is persistent, but the Mayor was
not inclined to give any hint concerning
his action in that matter, while he an
swered without hesitation concerning the
truth of the rumor about the reinstate
ment of Mose Gunst.
"I have not finally decided In any in
stance. I have, naturally, considered the
matter of the new members of the boards
and commissions, for it Is important and
concerns the public good materially. It is
so important that I am thinking It all
over carefully and hope to get the best
men for the places, i have not made any
announcements and shall not until tho
day before the vacancies take place.
While I am taking the opinions of good
citizens who make suggestions concern
ing the appointees I must finally follow
my own best judgment and that is what
I shall do."
"How about the story that you have
determined to name C. W. Mark as a
member of the Board of Education to suc
ceed himself?" was asked of the Mayor.
"Really now," replied his Honor. "I
cannot tell you anything about the mat
ter, for if I go on answering questions
concerning this commission and the other
commission, I shall be telling you what
I am going to do. I do not mean to
announce any appointments to fill the
pending vacancies until January 7, which
will be on the day before there are any
vacancies. Then all the newspapers will
get the news simultaneously. I let them
all have the facts before at the same
time."
"Have you decided on any appoint
ments?"
As to whether Mr. Gunst had been sug
gested as an available candidate to step
into the oJllcial shoes to be soon vacated
by Dr. McNutt the Mayor ottered no in
formation. He admitted, however, that
there had been some suggestions as to
who should be appointed to nil the sev
eral positions in the various city com
missionsâtho Board of Public Works, the
Civil Service Commission, the Board of
Education, the Police Commission, the
Fire Commission, the Election Commis
sion, the Park Commission and the Board
of Healthâ which will become vacant next
week by reason of the expiration of terms
as one-year appointees. He declined to
say who had been suggested in any in
stance.
"Certainly not." said the Mayor.
"There is no truth in the story at all."
"Then Moee Gunst will not be named
by you for tho position of Police Commis
sioner to succeed Dr. McNutt?"
Mayor Phelan denied, absolutely, last
evening a rumor which has been persfst
ently repeated about the clubs of the city
for several days, that he would appoint
Mose Gunst to be a member of the Police
Commission to succeed Dr. W. F. McNutt,
whose term will expire on January 8. This
Is one of the most interesting stories that
has keen going the rounds. It has not
only been heard in the clubs, but also
has been given currency In fraternal or
ders, being heard in lodge rooms, where It
has been received with credence by many.
"When Mayor Phelan was informed of the
extent to which the story had been spread
he said:

Outlines the Measures Which. He Bs
lieves Will Engage the Serious
Attention of Both
Among the many members of the Legis
lature who made San Francisco a way
station yesterday on their Journey to Sac
ramento was Alden Anderson, one of the
prominent and Influential members of the
Legislature at its last session and the
moat prominent aspirant for the Speaker
ship of the Assembly at tbe approaching:
session. Mr. Anderson expects to remain
in the city for a few days before he con
tinues his Journey to the State capital.
He was asked last night to express his
views of the Speakership situation, in
which he Is so intimately concerned.
"I have the utmost confidence," he said,
"that my candidacy for Speaker of the
Assembly will be honored by my fellow
members with success. I have already oc
cupied the distinguished position to which
I again aspire, and naturally the worth
of my service must be determined by my
associates and the public at large. It Is
very gratifying to me that I have now
only one opponent for the position which
I seek, the others who had appeared In
the field having withdrawn In my favor.
It is a matter of which I am naturally
proud â that my old associates In the As
sembly, with perhaps one or two excep
tions, have unequivocally declared their
purpose to vote for me for the position of
Speaker.
"It Is perhaps unnecessary for me to
say that in my candidacy for this posi
tion I have made no promises to any
member of the Assembly, nor have I
given any assurance In reference to the
formation of the various committees,
some of which will have to perform at the
coming session duties of an exceptionally
important chanvbter. I have met many
of the gentlemen who have been chosen
as legislators, and I can say emphatically
that I believe that the character of the
men who have been selected is as high
as that of any body of men ever dele
gated by the State to serve Its interests
In a legislative capacity.
"In my interviews with these men I
have urged that our best policy will be
to go absolutely free to Sacramento, to
view the various interests there involved,
and, untrammeled and unpledged, do our
best to serve the interests of the State.
"Some of the most important measures
ever presented for legislative discussion
at Sacramento will come before us for
consideration. From a partisan point of
view, which I conceive Is the least im
portant, the reapportlonment of the State
will be the measure which shall demand
our attention and necessarily will create
greatest Interest. From the legislative
standpoint the adoption of a new primary
law will be vital. The educational bill
covering measures proposed by the educa
tional commission and Involving the va
ried demands of our two great universi
ties will unquestionably be presented, con
sidered, and, I have no> doubt, adopted.
"The Interests of irrigationists, involv
ing the conservation of flood waters: the
mining laws including the question of Im
pounding dams, will call for most serious
attention from the members of both
houses. These, I apprehend, will engage
most of our attention, and I feel confident
that the session will pass Into the history
of the State as one which had been ab
solutely businesslike, economical and
thoroughly beneficial to the varied Inter
ests of California."

When a patient comes to me complain-
ir.s: of dull headaches, sour stomach, bad
:afte. nervousness, belching: of gas. or
heart trouble, which Is generally caused
from indigestion. I tell him. to take one or
two of Stuart's Tablets after each meal
and as often during the day as he has
r.ny trouble, and I feel confident I .have
given that patient the best advice I could
give."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are large,
pleasant tasting lozenges, containing dias-
tase and pepsin, combined with fruit and
Â¦vegetable essences. They are not cathar-
tic and do not act on any particular organ
like ordinary drugs, but simply act en-
tirrlv on the food eaten. They are a nat-
ural digestive, pure and simple.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents perpackage through-
out the United States, Canada and Great
jJritain.
They have little appetite, and if they
do have an appetite, the food they eat
does thf-m no good. Why? Because it Is
liut half digested, causing thin blood,
Â¦weak nerves, sleeplessness, achinjr bones.
fiains in chest, formation of ga?cs. belch-
rz. etc. They tell me they believe they
have consumption, or heart disease, rheu-
matism, nervous prostration, in fact most
cverv direase but the riR-ht one.
In "reality, the whole trouble is in the
ftomach and nowhere else. Now what do
I do with such p<>op!e? I don't feed them
on pre-digested foods like babies, nor
"Ftomach bitters." nor pa.tent nostrums
â¢which I know nothing about. Xo honor-
able physician will prescribe a remedy
unless he knows what lt contains and it3
probable effects.
For all such patients I have but one
prescription. I advls* them to go to the
nearest <5ruc store and get a 50-cent box
of Stuart' s Dyspepsia Tablets. I use them
v.ith remarkable success in all cases of
Irdigestlon and stomach trouble, because
I know what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
consist of and what they will do. They
contain the vegetable essences, diastase
end government test pepsin, which are the
things even* weak stomach- lacks to re-
fiore natural digestive vigor, and if I
had dyspepsia myself lt Is the one remedy
1 should take.
The wise, up-to-date, modern doctor Is
no longer ti^d down to the hard and fast
ri'Jps cf what his medical book3 say he
thai! use and what he may withhold Jn
treating his patient.
The successful doctor nowadays is the
cr.e who is quick to avail himself of any
remedy, new or old. which holds out a
chunce of cure no matter whether it is
Allopathic. Homeopathic or neither one.
Dr. Jennis=on. in an Interesting article
on ind!gÂ«?5=tition and dyspepsia says:
"Nine-tenths of all people, who apply to
rr." for advice and treatment think they
have this ailment or that ailment, but I

that Dr. E. A. Ross, lately removed from
the head of the economics department at
Stanford University, had been offered; a
position on the staff* of William J. Bryan's
proposed paper or that he had accepted a

knew nothing of the proposed connection
with Bryan's newspaper, but did not care
to be interviewed concerning the second
rumor. ; He said he could not verify the
statement that Dr. Ross had accepted a

OIL BOOH COLLAPSES.
Gasoline Engine Probably Responsi-
ble for Seepage in Santa Clara.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 29.â San Jose's oil boom
appears to have been a 1 little premature,
for Oil Expert Phillips Is convinced that
the .oil found on the Schmerber- ranch
near here is tho seepage from a gasoline
engine, which had been used for pumping
water in the vicinity. The engine was 'on
the side of a hill above where the oil was
supposed to be seeping from the ground,
and he states he - believes the discovery
was the seepage from . the engineer's oil
can and a barrel of crude oil that had
been used- at the engine. It seems that
some of the oil had been accidentally
spilled.
Great excitement was caused by the dis
covery on the Schraerber ranch. Resl-*
dents In the vicinity prospected night and
day, and land which formerly was held at
$100 per acre '. jumped to $1000 per acre. Â¦
They refused to sell or lease their land
and tresspass notices werÂ© posted.
Dr. J. Ellis Rodley, ex-Mayor of Chico,
who was. tried ajtd convicted of perjury,
may have to suffer. penal servitude for
his offense. The Supreme Court yester
day affirmed the judgment of the lower :
court* *
The evidence adduced at the trial de
veloped the fact that a man named Arthur
Fuller died In ButtÂ© County, and after his
death '. a" woman named Mrs. Minnie)
Houseworth presented what purported to
be the last will and testament of deceased
for probate. The estatÂ© "was valued at
$50,000 and the woman was named as tho
sole legatee. Fuller's signature .was at
tached to the document and two witnesses
attested to its genuineness, one of them
Rodley, who was one of thÂ© leading citi
zens of the county. -
During the probate of the â¢ will It de
veloped that Mrs. , Houseworth wrote the
will and she induced Rodley and another
man to sign It. ThÂ© evidence showed that
Mrs. Houseworth had approached other
people and asked them to sign the false
document.
Dr Rodley was arrested, tried and con
victed of " perjury- Ho appealed to the
Supreme Court and- his last hop* "of se
curing a new trial was blasted yesterday

Oil producers In two sections are pre
paring to protect their Interests by com
bination, as far as possible. Those of the
Kern County fields have progressed far
ther In the preliminaries than have those
In Los Angeles. Both sections see the ne
cessity ' for concerted action. George X.
Wendling has been made the general man
ager r of the Â¦ Producers* Association 'â¢Â¦' In
Kern County. He will assume the duties
at the . beginning : , of '.'- 1301. Under the
scheme adopted for. marketing the Kern
County oil it is estimated that a charge
of one | cent and possibly a fraction per
barrel will - be all that will be* required
above the freight rates.
The ' Los Angeles producers have held
several meetings to consider the storage,
transportation and marketing of their pe
troleum. ' After considerable discussion
they appointed a committee a week ago
to confer with the Oil Storage and Trans
portation Company, the proposition of
that institution not being considered sat
isfactory. -The substance of the com
pany's terms was that the oil would be re
ceived and paid for at the average price
received from its customers, less 10 cents
per barrel for storage and other expenses.
The committee was discharged at a meet
ing held last Wednesday and a new com
mittee was named to further consider
what ought to be done. Mayor Eaton is
the chairman of this committee.
The Los Angeles situation- is about this
way: Early this year the producers in
Lob Angeles combined for their own pro
tection and, with the aid of the railway
companies, succeeded not only In keeping
oil produced in outside fields from com
peting with the local product, but also
were able to keep prices at a standard at
which oil brought what was considered a
fair profit. For several months, accord
ing to the Los Angeles Times, it has been
evident that the - increased production- in
other . sections had weakened the pool.
Within the past sixty days prices have
shown a -marked decline. ." While there
has been a falling off in the demand."
says the Times, "it is also true that had
the producers held together the petroleum
market would have remained as firm'as
during the earlier months." The situation
may be complicated by the entrance of the
Standard Oil into the field. Interesting de
velopments In the industry within the next
few weekB are reasonably expected.
Oil companies to do business in Califor
nia are still numerously incorporating in
Arizona. Among the more recent com
panies Incorporated are the following:
Stockton Oil and Development Company;
Maricopa Oil Company; Mayflower Land
and Oil Company; Bella Vista Oil Syndi
cate; Puritan Oil Company; Morning
Glory Oil Company; California Fortune
Oil Company; Jewett-Blodgett-Beale Oil
Company; Shasta Consolidated Oil Com
pany; Tiger Oil Company of Bakersfleld;
Vesuvius Oil Company; London, and San
Francisco Oil Association; Vacayille Oil
Company: Blodgett Oil Company; El Cap
itan Oil Company; Geyser Oil Company;
Prlmavera Oil Company; Vulcan Oil Com
pany and Arroya Oil Company. The ag
gregate capitalization of these companies I
is $11,675,000. The amounts range from
$75,000 to 52,000.000 for the respective com
panies.
The first well at Tehachapi has been
started. There are two companies in the
field.
The first- well to go down in Shasta
County will be sunk on the Riverside
farm, which lies along the river directly
east from Redding and about one mile
and a half from the Courthouse. SeeD
ages are reported to have been discov
ered while a water ditch was being ex
tended.
There Is much activity in the Los Ance
les. district. New companies have been
putting down wells. Ono producer, L. G.
Parker, is credited with having fifty wells
on the pump.. C. V. Hall Is a close second
with thirty-five. G. W. Robinson has sev
enteen.
The Santa Maria Times reports ' much
activity in the Santa Maria field.
The Hanford Journal tells the following
story: . . ;., v ?
Jack Rebel, formerly of the Holland colony
oÂ£ this county, left Hanford on November 15
last for Amsterdam, to try to get his friends
there interested in oil lands In California.
Within ten days after his arrival he had or
ganized a company and secured a capital of
$!C0,000- He cabled the cash to pay for forty
acres of first-class land In the Kern River oil
district and his company Is ready to com
mence operations on the land. This U about
the liveliest work in the way of sale of oil
lar.rts. In view of the distance that had to be
traveled by the projector and the obstacles he
had to overcome, that is yet on record.
The Ray copper mines, limited, at Ray,
Arizona, will install oil burners In its con
centrating plant at that place. The com
pany used all the wood it could secure in
the district... building ; a- railroad -seven
miles in length to haul It.- Later an at
tempt to solve the fuel problem was made
by installing gasoline and distillate en
gines, and twelve of these ranging from
fifteen to fifty horsepower were put In.
But after some time spent in attempting
to regulate -and equalize the motion, to
give greater regularity to the running
gear, they were pronounced a failure and
the company has at last come to the con
clusion that liquid fuel Is the proper
thing. ' Experiments have been made
which prove Its efficiency and boilers will
now be used and Pteam power employed to
run the concentrators. A railroad will
be constructed to Red Rock, on the South
ern Pacific Railroad, where connections
may be made with the oil markets.
Several land sales that have recently
b$en effected tell the story of continued
interest in oil fields. Seventeen acres in
th southwestern extension of the Los An
geles city field brought $500 an acre. Lands
In the same vicinity have jumped from
grain acreage prices to $1000 per acre. The
Bakersfleld Callfornlan says: "A man
who had a chance to get in when land waa
selling for $2 50 an acre arrived from the
north this morning. After mature de
liberation he decided not to throw his
money away, but he has now about-made
up hU mind to purchase a tract at $2500
Â¦an acre."- A tract of 200 acres six, miles
northwest of Los Angeles has 'jeen sold
for a larpe sum to an Eastern jyadicata.

right to collect the money due it, yet it
was barred by the statute of limitations.
Dauer was sued for $24,108 87, which It was
claimed had not been turned over to his
successor in office. The facts In the case
shewed that Dauer had deposited $37,090 55

Dauer for the amount and two weeks

filed some years later, but the statute of
limitations operated against the plaintiffs

The Supreme Court handed down a de

Pacific and Central . Pacific railroads in
the suit brought against those corpora
tions by the city of Oakland to recover
taxes. In 1S34 the Council of the city of
Oakland, acting aa a Board of,Equaliza
tion, arbitrarily raised the assessment of
the railroads to $6S1,5OO. They refused to
pay and suit ,was brought to collect the
taxes. Judgment was given In favor of
the defendants in the lower court and
the city appealed. In affirming the judg
ment the Supreme Court holds that the
statute is very explicit In telling how as
sessments are to be raised or lowered, and
that the City Council, did not follow out
the letter of the law, inasmuch as there
was nothing, to show that testimony was
taken at t the hearing of the raising of
these assessments and its action was

Special Dispatch to The Call
SUISUN, Dec. 29.â Mrs. James H. White,
wife of a prominent orchardist of upper
Suisun Valley,, ended heV lite early thl3
morning by swallawing half of the con
tents of a bottle of cresolene. The death
of Mrs. -White was a gTeat shock to the
people of this community, as ahe has
shown no apparent signs, even to her own
family, of the contemplation of such a
horrible deed. She undoubtedly was tem
porarily deranged from cares and worries.
Her.husband was In very poor health and
she has been in constant attendance upon
him for about three weeks. He was 111 in
bed and in an almost helpless condition.
Mrs. White slept'on a lounge in the sick
room, which she left shortly before 4
o'clock this morning. Shortly thereafter
Mr. .White heard -the ciiesof one 'of the
children, who slept upstairs, and-thought
his wife was there. About three hours
later he called for some one to come to
his room, and his eldest daughter an
swered the call. "He at once asked where
her mother was and after looking about
the house, the Rlrl returned and told him
she could not find her. .
A â¢ search about . the buildings . was im
mediately made, and about 10 o'clock the
nearest neighbors were, notified. A num
ber of people responded and a general
search ' was instituted. At 11 o'clock
Georgre Wagner, one of the party, found
the lifeless body of the unfortunate wom
am . lying face downward In a shallow
stream of water in a creek about three
eighths of a mile from. the house. On the
bank of. the creek was the partly : filled
vial of poison, which explained the cause
of death. - . â¢ - "Â¦â¢ .
After leaving the house Mrs. "White" evi
dently wandered among the fruit trees on
the frost-covered ground and selected the
lonely spot for her death. She. was fully
dressed with the exception of shoes and
hat. The deceased was about 40 years of
age and was held Â» in high ' esteem by fall

duced to 300. In addition to the 2000 Chi
nese, there are 10,000 â¢ Italian residents of
tbe district. Dens of vice, Inhabited by
white as well as brown men and women,
infest the territory, and the priest's work
Is almost wholly confined to people who
have fallen from the graces of respecta
bility. Regarding the conditions of the
Chinese in the Eastern metropolis, Father
McLoughlin had this to say last night:
"My experience with the sportive ele
ment of the Chinese In New York has
been that the Mongolians will gamble
despite all efforts to suppress their sport.
They do not admit whit?' men to their
rooms and little harm is done. I do not
think it possible to stop them as long
as there are two of them left on earth
within traveling distance of each other.
The laws of New York City are against
Chinese gambling, but they are seldom
enforced, owing to the tribute which is
constantly paid to the police.
"l'ou might as well try to stop the ebb
of the tide as to attempt to suppress
gambling. Something in human nature
calls for games of chance, and the only
thing that can be asked for is that the
police keep the thing under cover as much
as possible, that it will not be flaunted
In the face of the public as If it had a
right to exist. From a theological stand
point we cannot license vice, but when
It must exist, it should be confined to cer
tain quarters and kept within bounds.
"It is almost uselss to try to instill any
principles of Christianity into the hearts
of the Chinese. I had three Mongolians
In my congregation. One of them did not
attend mass regularly on Sunday morning
and I took him to task for it. He replied
that If I had my 'celebration' on some
other day he would be willing to attend,
but Sunday was a day too full of pleas
ures to be interrupted by church going
He deferred to the mass as a 'celebration '
and that was all the significance it bore
for him. The other two Chinese regarded
Christianity probably in the same light "

be given for the benefit of the League of
the Cross Cadets at the Metropolitan

PLAN TO GREET
NEW CENTURY
Eight deputies In the Tax Collector's
office who did not take the civil service
examination and are consequently in dan
ger of losing their positions have decided
to bring suit to restrain the Civil Service
Commission from certifying to a list of
eligibles for positions of deputies In the
tax cSice until the Jecision is handed
down fa the cases new on appeal in tho
Supreme Court, The deputies who have
agreed to take steps to retain their posi
tior.E are Harry I3aehr Herman Enkle,
George Fiddes. \V. V'allet. Louis Devoto,
Berjuir.in Levy, John G. Fitzgerald and
Tie plan has been in contemplation ever
slr.ee the examination was held two
months ago. but no decided move was
ss'ade ur.ui a few day& ago and the facts
only Kaked out yesterday. As now agreed
upon Oeorge D. Collins, who has been re
laii.ed by the deputies interested, will go
before the Superior Court some time next
week and apply lor f>. restraining order to
prevent the commistio.i from certifying
the r.amt-s of eligible* for deputies in the
Tax Collector's olfl< c
Collins will base his application on tho
fact that one of the ccses now on appeal
before the Supreme Court concerns tiie
validity ut the txister.ee of the Civil Ser
v!<Â» <"i rnmission. Thv poin: at issue is
that there is no constitutional provision
for the appointment of a municipal Civil
Service Commission. On tho ground that
;he d<<.;>ion of the Supreme Court may
Fevers? the decision of Judce Cook, who
overruled the demurrer of the plaintiff
in that case, Collins w;il ask for a post
5.1 r.< rocr.t of the official acts of the com
mission until the diluted point Is set-
The deputies hope in this way to gain
r few months' time if the restraining or
<:<>r is pranted. as it jiÂ» not thought like'.y
that tho Supreme Court will hand down a
decision on the point mentioned nor on
that of the power of the commission to
create vacancies, whi.-h was argued be
fore Judge Hebbard. until next April and
possibly not until after that. The depu
ties hope to be continued in their places
until that time at least-
None of the deputies would discuss the
matter when approached yesterday. They
had several conferences with Tax Collect
or Scott, but he afforoed them scant com
fcrt. He stated that he had advised them
to take the examination and they had re
fused. Scott will hava a conference with
the Civil Service Coxrmission to-morrow
afternoon and will make a formal re
quest that the commission postpone the
certifications for his deputies until the
Supreme Court decision is handed down.
It is understood thav the commission is
disinclined to grant the request, and in
that event the suit will be brougrht by the
deputies. Scott emphatically states that
he is not concerned in this suit and is
not a party to it.
"I will ask the commission." said Scott.
"to grant me some consideration In the
matter of displacing most of my deputies
by civil service eligiblcs whom I know
nothing about. I am responsible for the
acts of my deputies am' I dislike to take
men "entirely unknown to me and dismiss
others Â¦whom I have found entirely rella-
Mp. I wiil certainly pxact a heavy bon-1
frnm any new men who will be forced
upon me. What the amount of the bond
Â¦wi'.l he I am unabl? to state, but as 2
ir.atter of self-protection it may be more
than some men would care to plve."

v The National ; Guard of the State of
California Is one of the organizations that
the Governor, in his message to the next
Legislature, will .deal with. It is stated
that he will suggest a revision of the
law governing that organization to tho
end that It may be more effective than
what U appears to bsÂ» at this time. Talk
in National Guard circles is to the effect
that at that session the Governor wIH
make a number of radical changes in tho
personnel of those who are hieh in the
councils of war and that several who are
now in the front will find that they are
to be superseded. This talk has connect
ed the names of several . with what is
said to be the Governor's proposition on
that line, but there <s no certainty that
those who are named are the ones who
are to be affected.
It is also stated that as an outcome of
the recent trial of Captain F. A. Nippert
for ha vine made a false parade report
charges are to be preferred against offi
cers of the First Regiment who are sev
eral pegs above the captain and that they
are to be based upon verifying the cap
tain's false report. This- will iuvolve an
other court-martial.
With the be&inninj? of the New Tear
active work will be r csumed In the sev
eral regiments throughout the State and
â¢weekly drills will be in order ag-aln.
Â¦ Colonel O'Nell. commanding the. First
Infantry Regiment, wiil shortly issue his
first order. In this will be the announce
ment of the appointment of a board for
the examination of the non-commissioned
officers of the First. There will also be
something in relation to battalion drill.
It Is probable that there will be estab
lished at the Page-street armory a school
of instruction for the non-commissioned
officers, so that all may be Instructed in
doing the same work In precisely the
same manner.
It Is I Said That Officers Outranking
. Nippert May Be Court-Mar
tlaled for Verifying His
False Report.
The National Guard Will Be

Court this afternoon .Judge Davis sen
tenced Hugh Buchanan to a term of ten
years in the State Prison at San Quentln
Prior â¢ to . this his attorneys asked for a
stay of execution and a new trial. ThÂ»
points on which a new trial was sought
were that the court had misdirected th*
Jury In matters of law; that the cou.4
erred in the decision of questions of law:
that the verdict is contrary to law; that
the verdict is contrary to the evidence
and that the Jury received evidence out
of court. All objections were overruled
and the court said the prisoner had a fair
trial.*
Notice of appeal was given and the court
granted a stay of execution until the at
torneys can arrange a bill of exception.

who gave the officials at the City Prison
one- of thÂ© UvoUest battles ox their experi

Mitchell was seen by the policeman to
purchase a pistol in' a Washington-street
store. The sleuth followed and when he
entered a nearby saloon on Jackson street
arrested him on a charge of carrying con
cealed weapons. In the man's pocket waa
found a ; letter, bidding farewell to his
friends and relatives and declaring that
life held no; more charm for him.
The police have little doubt that tho
man would, but . for ' his capture, have
added his name to the list of the holiday
suicides. At the prison Mitchell declared
his life to be bis own for him to take
if he pleased. - He threatened to make

Its members assert positively . that they
will not permit themselves to be bound
on the important question of the speaker

go to Sacramento unpledged on this point.
Most of them assert 'hat they have no

that they will use their own discretion la

It. is probable that Ihe Republican As

of the delegation before the members
leave this city. This caucus for this pur
pose will probably be held to-morrow or
on Wednesday, as some of the members
intend to go to Sacramento on Thursday.

for the honor of beiuar chairman of the

When They Arrive, in Sacramento^â Rivalry for .Chairmanship.
This city is rapidly becoming the cen
ter of political interest so far as the ap
proaching session of the Legislature Is
concerned. Senators. Assemblymen and
politicians from different parts of the
State are arriving in town and all ar<>
asking what the Republican Assembly
delegation from San Francisco Is going to
do or has done in reference to the chair
manship of the delegation and more par
ticularly in reference to the speakershlp
cf the Assembly.
Certain politicians interested In the for
tunes of certain candidates for this honor
are insisting that the San Francisco del
egation is pledged to this or that as
pirant and that the members of the lower
house of the Legislature from this city
will be bound at Sacramento to vote In
obedience to a compact already made in
this city. Nothing could be further from
the truth.

TAYLOR'S STRIKING WAY
OF SHOWING HIS I/OVE
Married Three Years and Now His
Wife Charges Sim With Threats
to Kill.
Mrs. May Taylor, who lives with her
parents on Twenty-second street, near
Telegraph avenue. Oakland, swore to a
complaint in Judge Fritz's court yester
day charging her husband, W. F. Taylor,
with threats to kill. He lives at 227 Ful
ton street, and is a newspaper canvasser.
Mrs. Tavlor said she was married three
years ago, but her husband was never
able to support her and they soon sepa
rated. 9 They lived occasionally together,
but he was' insanely jealous and used to
beat her, and twice _ he broke her nose.
He would lock her up in her room for
days at a time and refuse to : allow her
to sec . any one. He threatened to kill
her on numerous occasions, and when he
met her on the street he was In the habit
of striking her on the head and pulling
her hair. With her consent he had the
custody of their two-year-old child.
Friday night he came up behind her
on Sacramento street and struck her a
vicious blow on the back of the head.
Then he grabbed her by the hair and
threatened to kill her. Thomas Chandler
and a friend saw the assault and they
pitched into Taylor and gave him an un
merciful beating.
Mrs. Taylor told the Judge that she was
afraid her husband would kill her, as
besides breaking her nose twice he had
broken her arm and she. was still suffer
ing from the effects.
DBAGOED A SEA 3LIO1T
TÂ»nmm> HIS WAGON
Charles Fachini, a Teamster, Arrested
on a Charg-e of Cruelty to
Charles Fachini. a teamster, was arrest
ed yesterday by Officer Hooper of the So-
clety for the Prevention of Cruelty to An
imals on a warrant charging him, with
"dragging a sea lion along Sansome street
behind a wagon by means of a rope at
tached to the leg 1 of said sea lion." He
was released on $50 cash ball.
Kachinl took the sea lion from Fisher
man's Wharf to Paladlnl & Co.'s store
on Merchant street, acd when It reached
the store it was covered with blood by
being dragged over the cobbles. S. Gross
ltcht. whov Is employed In the "LTnion
Square Market, notified the society, and
said that the mammal was screaming
with the pain when It passed him. on
Sansome street.
When the complaint was presented to
Judge Fritz be- hesitated to sign It. as
he was not satisfied that a sea lion had
a "leg," but always understood it was
called a flipper. Warrant Clerk Peery
assured him that "leg" was the proper
term to use. so he signed the complaint.
The question of whether a sea lion has
a leg or a flipper will probably form thÂ©
most interesting part of the case when
It comes to trial.

LOCAL REPUBLICAN DELEGATION TO THE ASSEMBLY
15 UNPLEDGED ON THE SELECTION OF SPEAKER
â¢ - Â¦ â¢
1* .F Kris Krlngle had entered the rooms
of the Cosmos Club last evening and
seen the two members who were im
personating him he would have filed
a strong protest with the board of
directors. . To his mind, and the minds of
other believers In "Santy." it was a sacri
lege for Lawrence Harris and Willis Dodd
to act the part* in evening dress. Both
gentlemen," attired In tuxedos, stood on
tables close by a brilliantly lighted Christ
mas tree and with wit and satire passed,
out ' packages to. the half- hundred mem
bers who participated In the merriment.
' G. W. Fredrlcks, who Is with the Union
Iron Works, was Inveigled to the front at
the outset .of the festivities and was pre
sented with a pasteboard cruiser. Â¦ Mr.
Dodd, who made the presentation speech.
Informed the recipient that the ship had
been built by the subscription of fellow
members and a few "Jack-pots." that it
had been fittingly named Mllpita.s and
that the sealed orders in the cabin were
not to be opened until he was "half-seas
over." William L.B. Mills was given a
paste diamond that outshone the famous
Kohinoor. Charles Woods, the alleged
baby of the club, was given a bottle with
a nipple attachment, but the contents,
which he was forced to drink, were a little
stronger than milk. Andrew Carrlgan
graciously accepted a bottle filled with
colored elixir of life, and then kicked be
cause he could not taste of the contents
without breaking the flask. Alex T. Vo
gelsang was given a toy set of fishing ap
paratus, and he immediately went in
search of "suckers." Harry R.WIHlar was
given a tin horn to arouse him out of his
lethargy. Carey Friedlander accepted a
Parisian novelty. Edward S. Swan Jr..
who is known as the "king of knockers,
Â¦was given a huge mallet to help him 111
his good work. John H. Miller was given
a miniature racecourse. Robert Hatch,
the well-known rancher, was given a cow,
and found fault with it because It was
minus its tail. Henry Eickhoff accepted a
donkey, which purported to have come
from William Jennings Bryan of Nebras
ka. W. B. Bradford, president of the
club accepted everything that, came his
way and looked for more, and there were
presents for every member of the organl-
Harris and Dodd aroused lots of merri
ment by their happy speeches. The joshea
on the members were heavy at times, but
were appreciated just the same.
Previous to giving out the annual gifts
the members and friends of the club en
joyed a bounteous repast. The dining
room was prettily decorated with holly,
Christmas berries and wreaths and bore
a holiday appearance. The guests occu
pied six tables and the banquet was a
merry affair. W. B. Bradford delivered
a speech of welcome, and at the conclu
sion of his happy remarks the banqueters
attacked the good things set before them.
Between courses clever speeches and pa
pers were heard. Crittenden Thornton In
an elaborate oration presented the presi
dent with a brass watch, the tick of
which could be heard amid the hearty
laughter. Wilbur Zlegler sprung a num
ber of joshes In rhyme, Alex T. Vogelsang
spoke and said he hoped the club would
be as prosperous at the close of tbe next
century as it was at the close of this, but
earnestly hoped that the present officers
would not be at the helm. Henry Eickhoff
told a few truths about the club that
aroused laughter, and Wallace Everett
scored a hit with his dialect verses. James
P. Langhorne duly presented Chri3tmas
presents to the employes of the club, after
which the banqueters adjourned to the
Christmas tree and spent the rest of the
night listening to excellent music and wit
ty remarks.' -\* "-:Â¦.,:**..Â¦'Â¦Â«

the Social Hall of the Alcazar

amount of merriment and good-fellow

al men can excel the "knight of the grip"
in making the time pass- merrily, and for
five hours the travelers drove dull care
away. One hundred and fifty members of
the association assembled around the
festive board and enjoyed a bountiful
feast. The edibles were not the only
"good things" provided, for there was a
feast of wit and a flow of eloquence which
called for constant applause at the hands
and lungs of the representatives of San
Francisco'f wholesale houses.
Ed J. Warnecke, the president of the
local branch of the association, was In
the chair and he was ably seconded by
every member present. No set course of
speeches was used, the president calling
upon any brother of the craft as he saw
fit. The menu was sandwiched- in with
songs, jokes, anecdotes, experiences and
musical numbers galore, and it was at

The residents of Siskiyou County arÂ«
all agog over a big suit which was filed
at Treka last week. It involves some "of
the most prominent citizens of that sec
tioti of the State and land and cattle val
ued at $100,000. It Is thought there will bÂ«
developments cf a sensational character
when the action comes to trial. Jerome
Churchill, president of the Siskiyou Coun
ty Bank, Is defendant In the suit. He will
toe called upon by the plaintiffs. Mrs. Mar
tha S. McConnell. executrix of the estate
of "William McConnell. deceased, and
George Simmons, to make an accounting
for property which has been In his pos
session for the last fifteen years.
It appears from the complaint that on
April 9, 1SS6. John Fairchild. the present
Coroner and Public Administrator of Sis
kiyou County, executed a promissory note
to Jerome Churchill for $42,800, half of
which was advanced to him by Churchill
and the other half by William McCon
nell and George Simmons.
Two weeks later Fairchild transferred
to Jerome Churchill 1400 head of livestock,
together with about 12,000 acres of land, as
aecorlty for the money advanced him.
Churchill took the property in /his ovra
name for the benefit of his partners and
retained the same until December 18. 1S97.
when Fairchild made an absolute transfer
to the banker of all the property and ac
cumulations In. payment of an indebted
ness of $133,300. which represented the In
terest upon the original investment of $42.
$00 and subsequent advancements made
by the Siskiyou County Bank.
The complaint states that Jerome
Churchill has had the exclusive manage
ment and control of the valuable prop
erty to the exclusion of his partners from
18&6 to the present time. The action Is
therefore brought to compel Churchill to
account for all the personal and real prop
erty transferred to him by Fairchild. and
also for the increase of stock upon the
ranch In controversy.
William McConnell died on October 8.
1SSS, and In his last will and testament he
bequeathed all bis property to his wife.
She is now in straitened circumstances
and is therefore making an effort to se
cure her share of the partnership.
Churchill's deposition is to be taken be
fore Judge J. 8. Beard on January 8.

The morning's programme as begua
v.ith several tongs most artistically ren
<i>.red by pupils of the Everett Grammar
School, directed by Lliss Cora J. Galla-
ctate Superintendent of Schools Kirk
rave an address en "Sujrgestions Relative
to a State Course of Study." He quoted
Statistics gathered by Dr. William T
Harris, United States Commissioner of
Education, showing that half of the
pupils who enter th* public schools drop
cut by the time the end of the second
year is reached and that three-fourths of
then go no farther than the end of th.?
third year. In twenty-one representative
cities, inducing San Francisco, onlv
three-tenths of one T>er cent of those who
enter the schools fro through the course
z.r.& graduate from the high schools. Th'a
rendition, the speaker contended, was
cue to courses of study that disregarded
tee environment of the pupil, -Â»*ere is
much in the courses that might be omit
ted and the practical education which
must be offered if the boys, particularly.
are to be held in school, is ienored in
th*Â» main. Superintendent Kirk offered the
fallowing suggestions as to. remedies for
ihe condition he had illustrated by sta
tistics:
firstâ Compulsory school attendance under
5_me euhch lair a? the measure recommended
ty the /California Educational Commission.
"In that measure." said Mr. Kirk,
"much thought has been expended on ef
forts to place safeguards around the
rights oi the parent â so much so that
tome have looked upon the result as un
catisfactory from the standpoint of com
pulsory attendance. Still, we have reason
to believe that, in the first place, its
passage by the Legislature .s possible,
and, in the second, it will be effective.
end its enforcement will be an education
in the right direction and will make an
ideal law possible after a time."
Secondâ Greater adaptation of school work
to the needs cf pupils.
Thirdâ The introduction cf more industrial
mcrk in the ecfcocls.
"To this end." Mr. Kirk said, "a re
formation of the course of study is per
emptory- Oi necessity many things at
present taught must be crowded out if
r.ew work is to be introduced. That will
tax your judgment to the uttermost. What
Is there that may be droppc-d without a
loss approaching the gain secured by the
Introduction "f new work of an industrial
character? That is the question which
you teachers must be revolving in your
rr.inds. for if the problem is to be solved
j <>u must do ;t."
P. M. Fisher of Oakland was called upon
by Superintendent Kirk to discuss the
course of study of the elementary schools.
In the course of his remarks he criticized
severely the part university professors
had played In forming the courses of
study of the public schools. He said:
We have been etrainlrx for years urujer the
burden of the Influence of the two universities.
We have been looking in the direction of the
product cf the nigh school rather than toward
the profiuct of the grammar school. I will
j-jeld to to one in lcyalty to the University of
California, cr to Stanford University, and I
have the tincereat admiration fcr their profes
sor* of pedag-OK}- and psychology- But I say
that the schools of the State are euHerlng be
rsuse cf the pressure cf these two institutions,
which are looking for a *ati?ractory product
frcm the higii echoole. rather than looking
<Sown to the product of the primary and gram
jriar schools, which, after all, are the pecpfe'i
ecrcols.
JÂ«J:n Ewett and Superintendent MeCly
nonfis cf Oakland took exception to the
figures quoted by Superintendent Kirk.
contending that so far as California was
concerned they were misleading.
Professor E. P. Cubberly of Stanford
tTr.iversiaty said that Southern cities were
Included in the twenty-one of the list, and
consequently the totals did injustice to
euch cities a* San Francisco, where the
attendance is much above the average in
the Southern States.
'.'his discussion vu part of the delib
erations of the council of education, de
clared by President McClyraonds to be in
BPtsion for that purpose. In continuance
of itÂ» deliberations Professor E. E. Brown
presented the report of the committee on
! course of etudy for elementary schools.
â¢General recommendations were made, and
I.i accordance with one of them the com
nission as above named was appointed.
A:ter the course of study is worked out
by it and the committee the result will
be furnished to the County Boards of Ed
ucation throughout the State for adoption
as tne uniform course of study. ,
ThÂ» association itself was declared to be
in session following the deliberations of
the council. Mrs. M. M. Fitzgerald pre
ee rated the secretary's report, showing: the
TTu-mbtrship to have reached 11S5. with
A.&meda, Santa Clara and San Francisco
counties yet to be heard from. It is
thought that the association's member
ship win reach 1400 btfore the next annual

An Office of Great Power and as Old
SPEAKER OF COMMONS.
as English " Liberties.
The office of Speaker of the House of
Commons, says the London Spectator, lg
nearly as fold as English liberties. â The
chair of Sir Thomas More has been filled
many times by men who played a sound-
Ing part in the Struggle for the recogni
tion of Parliament. Sometimes the Speak
er might be the creature of the King, b^
more often he was the real voice of the
Commons., His duties have always been
twofold, for while ho was the ohairman
of the House, the Interpreter -of Its rules
and the final authority on its procedure,
he was. also the representative of the
House, who demanded from the King a
recognition of Its Â¦ privileges, and acted
as the medium of communication with the
crown.; By virtue of his office he is the
first Commoner of Kneland. He ; . is lha
type and center of the Jealously guarded
prerogatives of tho Commons and, as
such, the guardian .of English freedom.'
The Speaker of the House. of Lords, the
Lord â¢ Chancellor, . compared to him, has
very limited and Ineffectual powers, since
he sits outside the House, has no control
of debate, and no auchorlty on points of
order. The Speaker of the Commons, on
the other hand. Is tha very type of. the
House over which he presides; he keeps
order, and while professing himself the
very humble servant jjf the members, has
an almost despotic ' power over . a ref rac-'
tory Individual.? His presence in the chair
is the guaranty for freedom of debate.
Only once do ithe journals of the House
record an invasion of that rlfrht; In Jan
uary, 1642, we read that "his Majesty came
Into the e House and " took Mr. ;. Speaker's
chair. 'Gentlemen, , I am sorry to have
the occasion to come unto you.' "And
then the record breaks off, and we may
draw a moral from Us silence. -
But the, duties of the Speaker to-day
are much ' enlarged from the time when
;Addington:or Manners Sutton/ exercised
his mild rule.. Then* the procedure of tho
House was vague and. .unsettled, â¢: there
were, few means of dealing summarily
with offenders and of curtailing a cap
tious, debate. Sometimes the Speaker was
a man such as Onslowv whose word: was
law, because for thirty-three years he had
the Â¦ confidence of tho Â¦ House, Â¦ but ; . more
often , he was â¢ an , easy-going gentleman
with no - effective machinery of control
save In the last resort: But the efforts of
Mr.'PameJl and his friend* made Inevit
able a new and . sterner regime, v; To-day
the Speaker ; can allow or disallow : tho
closure as he thinks tit ; he , can refuse to
put to the House any, motion for adjourn
ment which, ho, thinks vexatious;; he can
curtail : any Â¦ speech ; which . seems ; to him
to be wandering, from the question ' at is
sue. In addition, he has an absolute au
thority on points " of : etiquette Â¦ and- If his
ruling is disputed .her can name the" of
fender to ' the House and ' have him sus
pended or' otherwise runished.

Suit by the Lippkowskis to
Have Their. Daughter's
Marriage Annulled.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Dec. 29.
Frederick LJppkowski and his wife have
evidenced their determination not to rive
up their daughter Â» Caroline to her newly
wedded husband, Chris Carli, by filing a
suit" to have the marriage between the
youthful pair declared null and void. '
The wedding was solemnized by Justice
Qulnn on the 27th of last month. The
young people slipped away together, came
to Oakland, procured a license and were
made husband and wife before the unsus
pecting parents of the girl had any knowl
edge of the affair. : 'iy; :\U iv-^ v
The complaint filed to-day says that the
daughter returned home immediately aft
er the ceremony was performed and that
she and Carll have never lived together.
The day after the marriage Mrs. LJpp
kowskl came to Oakland to investigate
the affair. She was enraged to find that
her worst fears were true and that a
license had been issued to the pair, in
which Carli had stated under oath that
his intended'bride was 18 years old. This
statement. Mrs. Lippkowskl said, was
perjury, as her daughter was only 16 years
of age. She at once declared her Inten
tion " of prosecuting her- unwelcome son
in-law for felony, and promised to land
him In San Quentln If there was any law
to reach him. \
At this juncture a wealthy uncle of
Carll came forward and sided with the
young people. He said that they should
not be separated, nor should his nephew
be convicted of perjury if it took his en
tire fortune to prevent it. -
Apparently this unexpected opposition
has changed the Llppkowskls' plans. The
criminal charge has not been presented
and a civil one is substituted.
The complaint states that neither of the
plaintiffs gave consent to the marriage;
that their daughter Is but 16 years of age.
and that therefore the marriage was ille
gal and the court is petitioned for its an
nulment.
.The parents say that Carll has no
means nor Income, and. that he is utterly
unable to support himself, to say nothing
of a wife, and that he knew they were
opposed to their daughter having any
thing to do with him.
The Ldpnkowskls conduct a wayside sa
loon at 3022 Clement avenue, adjoining
the carhouse of the Sutro Railroad Com
pany, In this city. It is much frequented
by tlje grave diggers from the City Ceme
tery arid ' teamsters engaged in hauling
sand for grading lots in . the immediate
vicinity. V
Caroline, the heroine of the adventure.
Is a' second daughter. She appears to be
about the age her ; parents claimed, but
in the ways of the world is wise beyond
her years.
The groom la spoken of very highly by
those who have met him/ and despite tha
mother's ; interference in the matrimonial
affair the daughter s.ays she loves him
yet.\ Â¦ . Â¦ : . . Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦â¢' Â¦ - 'Â¦;Â¦Â¦, . ' t -
Caroline was working with a family on
Pierce street at the time the marriage oc
curred. She gave ; up . her. place at the
time and has since returned to her own
family.
Carll is employed as a bartender at the
Olive House, 612 California street. 'Both
he and his wife are under age. Â«

LAST CHANCE FOR TERRY.
National Sporting Club of London
Insists Upon Quick Reply.
NEW YORK. Dec. 29.â The National
Sporting Club of Txmdon has decided to
give McGovern tmtll January a In ordfr
to make up his mind whether he will nÂ«ht
Ben Jordan. If at the end of that timw
Terry dees not answer, the fpather-wplsM
champion never will get another chancÂ«
to fipht Jordan or any one else at thar
club.
"Under no circumstances will the pur.'e
be Increased." said Dr. Ordway. the Na
tional Club's representative. "The club
will jrtve the hoys a purse of $C73<>, with
liberal expenses to McGovern. If MeGnv
crn does not come to the scratch by Jan
uary 5 he never will get a chance to flsht
at the National Club."
Kid Broad's manager said to-day h#> hn<1
received an offer of $3000 to meet McGov
ern at San Francisro during the flrsr
week of February. -The National Athlctl â¢â¢
Oub. it is said, is ready to hang up thÂ»
incentive. Broad never expected he wouM
get this much money, and Immediateiv
awepted. He has* wired the National peo
ple to send the articles to Loulsvillp.
where Broad will train for his battle, with
Dave Sullivan.

IT mast assuredly have been cratify
ing to Prince Foniatowskl as he
ftood on the root of the clubhouse
surrounded by a cluster of society
folks to see his promising two-year
old Brutal, capture thÂ« Juvenile Cham
pion stakes at Tanforan Park yesterday.
In a desperately fought finish the son
of Imp. Brutus, with Winnie O'.Connor
end 119 pounds in the saddle, snatched the
long end of the 52625 prize from Walter
Jennings' Canmore by a long neck. â¢ It
was no cheap, trashy victory, for behind
The pair named followed such select ones
as Rolling Boer. Golden Age. Kenilworth
and Bedeck. Of course Golden Age and
Rolling Boer, coupied In the betting, were
overwhelming choices. The latter colt,
while owned by W. M. Cahill, is trained
by Sam Hlldrcth. It was early prophesied
that Brutal would be hard to beat, and
from 10 his odds fell to' 6. Canmore at the
Fame price was expected to prove the
thorn in the side of the first choioea. At
the post Canmore acted like a hoodlum,
f.nally getting none the best of it when
the barrier was released. Still, the same
could be said of Btutal. for. with more
ppeed, Kenilworth and' Golden Age closed
in on him before the turn was reached.
Kenilworth, with a mighty flight of speed,
tiptoed in front of Golden Age to the
Mretch. then both were ready and willing
io retire. Bedeck and Rolling Boer were
far back, and It remained for Canmore
and Brutal to fight it out. Xt the pad
tfock Canmore looked a winner, then
O'Connor laid fcslde the whip, fairly lifted
the Prince's two-year-old off his feet and
won by a neck, covering the seven fur
longs in 1:2jT4. Coming from the rear
Rolling Boer ran third.
Prince Ponlatowski was highly elated
over the j-uccess of his two-year-old, and
it Is understood the youngster will be pre
pared for both the California and Amer
ican. Derbies. He is a chestnut, green as
yet and growrhy, and will Â¦ bear consid
erable watching if nothing happens him.
The usual big Saturday crowd was pres
ent, and the betting more than brisk. A
ftrong breeze swept over the- course, re
tarding the horses somewhat when headed
for the wire. Aside from the Ftake, none
of the other numbers possessed much
claps, the favorites thrice leading out
their fields.
Quite like, old times, the steeplechase
furnished the smart one of the afternoon.
While Lord Chesterfield became drowsy
in the ring, Credo, with Sutherland In the
Â»-acdle. was backed from 10 to 3, and won
&11 the way. Nearly making a xnistakÂ©
at the first jump, "Boots" Durnell's horse
thereafter fenced well, never leaving the
result in doubt, Mestor beat the favorite
out for second place.
Backed almost off the boards. Bob
Smith's two-year-old, I>ana Brown, madÂ©
c show of her field In thÂ© opening sprint
for maiden fillies. Annello, the Corrigan
cntrj'i a SO to 1 chance, ran In ahead of
Companion for the place.
Bill Garrett. the Missouri gelding, which
seems capable of running as fast as he
wants to. made it four straight In thÂ©
mile pursÂ© run. The books laid 7 to 10,
and he won throwing the bit away. Woos
ter Boy bluffed along with Bullman for
eeven furlongs, and then, lost thÂ© place
to MacGyle.
Owing to his name of being a hard luck
"critter," 2 to 1 was obtainabl* against
Opponent winning thÂ© mile and a six
teenth eelling affair. Dr. Bernaya, It was
thought", could lower his number, but the
Doctor failed to get Inside the money.
With little In reserve. Opponent was
ridden out by Coburn, to down St. Wood,
a 10 to 1 shot. Edgardo, thÂ© Elmwood
farm entry, ran third.
A pcrambta for maidens at six and a
half furlongs closed the day's sport. PhoÂ«
nissa, a likely looking filly by Brutus,
camÂ© home a length before her stabla
companion, Brenhilda, Ilaralamb, the fa
vorite, ran unplaced.

HOTED THEATER'S
DOORS REOPEN
Comedie Francaise Returns
to Its Old Home in
Paris.
PARIS. Dec. 23.â A brilliant spectacle
vu pn?5ented at the Theatre Francais
to-night on the return of the Comedie
Francaise to its old home, which has been
rebuilt on scientific methods Fince it was
ruin*Â»d by fire last March. The occasion
celebrated with a gala performance,
and it Is doubtful if the historic playhouse
ever held a more distinguished gathering
of representative Frenchmen. The Chief
of State and Madame Loubet occupied the
Presidential box, while the King of the
R*Â»Jgians made a special trip from Brus
sels to attend the function, engaging the
Baignore, formerly belonging to his uncle,
the Due d'Aumale- M. Waldeck-RouÂ«
eeau, the Premier, members of the Cab
inet, and all the leading lights In politics,
literature and the drama, were assembled
within the famous edifice. United States
Embassador Porter and his daughter sat
In the Embassadorial box.
The programme consisted of the fourth
act of Comellle's "Le Cid," the third act
of Moliere's "Femmes Savantes," con
cluding with a prologue on the reopening
of the theater written by Richepln.
Mounlt-Sully, Salvain. Coquelin Cadet,
and Mesdames Dudley escaped from
the fire when Mile. Henrlot perished).
Bariottl and Bartet took leading roles.
The traditional . ceremony which attends
every historical . performance 'at the v
Theatre FranCais was a. most picturesque
:Â«ccne. The stage represented a baronial
hall, with two stone benches on either
Ride. The bust of Moliere was decorated
with the trl-color and a golden wreath.
All the members of the troupe, attired
in fcarlet and ermine, entered two by two,
bowed to the audience and placed a laurel
wreath around the bust, to which they
then bow?d. afterward taking their places
ort the benches. Mounlt-Sully, in the role
of Doyrn of the company; Mme. Bariotti,
as the Muse of Comedy, and Mme. Bartet,
the Muse of Tragely. then spoke an elo
quent poetical prologue and the curtain
fell to the strains of the "Marseillaise."
The theater has undergone little struc
tural alteration, but numerous improve
ment* have been Introduced, such as a
new fireproof curtain, better staircase ar
raja^ements and safety exits for both the
public and the artists In caae of fire. One
of thÂ«Â» principal innovations is an elevator.
The auditorium Is tattefully decorated in
jrold and rich red. Houdon's statue of
Voltaire, which was nearly destroyed in
the flre owing to vhe difficulty of remov
ing it, is now placed on wheels. Tapestry
from the famous Gobelin factory, repre
senting the crowning of Mollere by cele
brated members Â«f the Comedie Pran

execute, hung In the foyer for the first
time to-night.

The Fernald boy and several others
were playing together on the Twelfth

his playmates could 3wlm and they ran
helplessly about while the lad struggled
in the lake. Dunakin heard their cries
and rushed to the spot. Young Kernald
had already given up and gone under the
surface, but his rescuer dived after him
and brought him to the surface. Medical
help was summoned and after some time
the boy was resuscitated and taken to his
home, where his parents were overjoyed
at his escape from his. perilous adven

The committee on legislation is corn

act. So long as the Grand Jury Is a. branch of
the court and Is called upon to discharge Us
duties It should be protected. If a Grand Jury
acts honestly it should be protectedâ should not
be vilified. On the other hand, if the Grand
Jury acts . corruptly It certainly should be
brought to Justice.
Now. gentlemen of the Jury, it may be that
you, as members of the Grand Jury. In the
discharge of your duty, .will have to act in
such a way th?.t it will bring down upon your
heads condemnation by the public press, con
demnation by persons who may act honestly
or who may act corruptlyâ I mean Individual
personsâ but gentlemen of the Jury. I take it
that each and all of you have character enough
and determination enough as public officers of
this county to act without resard to feaV or
favor, end to do your duty as officers of the
county, and to take the responsibilities what
ever they may be. I charge you, therefore,
that you are not under any circumstances to be
Intimidated by the possibilities of' what may
come to you in the future. Do your duty as
men; do your duty in 6uch a. way that you
shall be satisfied, your conscience shall be sat
isfied, of course, always obeying: the law as
your intelligence gives you to understand it.
Do your duty, gentlemen, without fear or favor
I think in the end if you do that, whatever
may come, you will deserve and receive proper
consideration from those whom you are brought
I would suggest, gentlemen of the Jury, in
view of the fact that these charges against the
late Grand Jury were eo publicly made and
definitely iriade, that It would be well for you
to indicate to the District Attorney a certain
day, some day during your service, on which
you will be ready to receive any proper evi
dence touching the matters thus publicly
charged: so that the District Attorney may
give notice that anybody who knows any. fact
or circumstance tending to show that any per
son or persons interfered with the action of
the Grand Jury or did anything to cause the
Grand Jury to act Improperly In that matter
or In any matter. Designate a day when you
will hear, testimony upon that subject. You
would be entitled, notwithstanding the provl
slons. of the statute, which throw around the
Grana Jury protection, you would be entitled
to call before you each and every member of
the late Grand Jury and interrogate them as
to whether any person or persons, either col
lectively or individually, approached them with
reference to any matters pending before them.
You may Interrogate . each member of the
Grand Jury as to whether anybody, high or low,
rich or poor, approached them upon any sub
ject outside of the Jury room, approached them
upon any subject pending before them; you may
Interrogate them as closely as the circum
stances of the case demandâ give them a thor
ough examination.
Now. gentlemen of the Jury, one thing further
In this connection: If you Mart in upon an In
vestigation of this matter, as In all other mat
ters under the Instructions given you by the
court, you should receive none but the best
evidence. ,You are not to receive hearsay evi
dence. If a man know a thing let him tell It
to you. but receive no man's speculation. Go
after the facts and take what he knows of his
own knowledge, not hearsay. Nevertheless, gen
tlemen, if you know or have reason to believe
that any man that may come before you or
any other man knows any fact. In connection
with any charge pending before you, you
should order him to be brought ' in. But the
testimony that you take, let It be such testi
mony' as the law permits and none other.

"LIQUOR-DEALERS' OASES
LIKELY TO BE DROPPED
Ead of the Long Fight, to Compel
Berkeley Saloon-Keepers to
Pay Fines.
OAKLAND, Dec. 29.â Unless some un
expected developments take place in the
Berkeley liquor dealers' cases the matter
will be dismissed by Judge Greene next
Monday.
The cases have been attended with bit
ter contentions since the arrest of the
eleven saloon men and their conviction
and sentence by Justice Edgar of Berke
ley. They were fined $250 each, "and at
once appealed the cases to the Superior
Court. Meanwhile the saloon element be
gan a campaign for . the repeal of the
prohibitory â¢ ordinance under which the
convictions were secured.
The temperance ' people did everything
in their power to prevent repeal, but final
ly the saloon men gained -enough votes
in the Town Board : to Insure their ' suc
cess before the cases were set for hear
ing before Judge Greene. During the pub
lication of the ordinance in the local pa
per, which was strongly anti-saloon in
sentiment, a mistake occurred in the com
posing-room ' which delayed the passage
of. the ordinance until after the date of
the hearing in the Superior- Court. The
liquor dealers, however, secured a contin
uance on the plea of 'Attorney Chapman'3
inability to ' appear ; in , court. The ordi
nance was passed, and when the case was
qalled to-day a communication was read
from' Town Attorney. Hayne of Berkeley,
giving it as his opinion that Â¦ there was
nothing .for... the court -to: do but to dis
miss ! the cases. Judge Greene announced
that he would , take the matter , under ad
visement until Monday.
the showing that the documents were not
sufficient in themselves to make a case.
There the matter rested until to-day,
when Judge Greene brought it before the
new Grand Jury in such a way that it
will again be a subject of investigation by
the Inquisitorial body of Alameda County.
His Honor refers In his charge to the
right of the jury to free access to all pub
lic offices and records of the county, and
adds:
Some misunderstanding seems to have arisen
heretofore and posribly now exists as to what
constitutes a public record. There is no pro
vision or our statute that I am aware of which
defines what constitutes a public record: but
the law in that regard Is not uncertain. The
American and English Encyclopedia of Lev.
d*:a!s with that subject, and its language is
clear and explicit, and to that I will call your
attention:
"Public officers ere largely authorized by
etatute to keep certain record*, but. If a mem
crlal or book be kept, which Is a necessary or
even a convenient and appropriate mode of dis
charging the duties of the office. It becomes a
public document or record."
At much length Judge Greene defines
the law to the Grand Jury upon the sub
ject of what constitutes a public record,
and concludes, reading from a textbook,
on that subject:
To entitle a book to the character of an of
ficial register it is not necessary that it be re-
Quired bj* sn express statute to be kept, nor
that the nature of the office should render the
book Indispensable. It is sufficient that It be
directed by the proper authority to be kept,
and that it be kept according to such direc
tions.
The law of this Â£fate therefore, gentlemen
of tbe Jury, upon this fubject has been settled
practically since 1S56.
Then Judge Greene proceeded to say:
The last Grand Jury of this county, gentle
men of the Jury, found an Indictment against
the County Assessor of this county; also an
accusation against him fcr willful and corrupt
misconduct in office. The action of that Grand
Jury in finding that Indictment and in finding
that accusation was criticized through the pub
lic prints, by public Journals in this city and
in our neighboring city of Alameda. If I recol
lect aright. It was declared, as I recall it,
that the action of the Grand Jury was corrupt,
in that It was charged that It had been
brought about by the friends of Victor H. Met
calf. who was then a candidate for re-election
to Congress. This charge waÂ» made and reit
erated, as I recall It. several times through dif
ferent publications here In the county.
A public meeting: was also called, as I recall
It, to denounce the action of the Grand Jury In
that regard, wherein they found an indictment
against the Count;- Assessor and an accusation.
The charge was made, as I remember posi
tively, that the action of the Grand Jury was
broucht about by friend* of Victor H. Met
calf. Gentlemen of the Jury. I call your at
tention to this matter because it "was an at
tack upon the Grand Jury, and this Grand
Jury *o fax as It lies within Its power should
investigate that question, and If found to be true
if there Is a means of punishing the members
of the Grand Jury they should be brought to
Justice. Again, if any persons were Instru
mental with the Grand Jury in corruptly bring
ing about the finding of an Indictment against
the County Assessor or an accusation against
the County Assessor those persons should be
brourht to Justice.
I call these matters to your attention, gentle
men, because they are matters of public noto
riety, and If true this Grand Jury should take
euch action as the. law provides for bringing
any parties who acted guiltily to Justice. On
the other hand. If there was nothing In those
charges. If those charges emanated from and
were brought about for political purposes the
people of this county are entitled to know It.
Gentlemen, the Grand Jury of this county
and the Grand Jury properly impaneled of
every other county is an Important adjunct of
th* Judicial branch of the government. It has
been to considered almost from time immemo

CITY ATT0BNEY DOW
Labor Agent Mullen Would Test
Eight Soar Law by a Crimi
nal Prosecution.
OAKLAND, Dec. 29â J. H. Mullen/busi
ness agent of the Building Trades Coun
cil, and City Attorney Dow ba/1 a wordy
war on the City Hall steps this morning,
the controversy arising from the fight
that Is on about the failure of the Board
of Public Works to enforce the eight-hour
law against city contractors.. Mullen
asked Dow If he would submit td arrest
on a charge of misdemeanor, as presi
dent of the board, for failing to have an
eight-hour clause inserted in tbe con
tract of John Worthlngton for replanking
the dty wharf. Dow said the mandamus
proceedings heretofore proposed were suf
ficient to Insure a test of the law. He
objected to the bringing of criminal
charges and claimed this move was politi
cal In Its nature, a statement Mullen de
nied. Agent Mullen declares that counsel
for the Building Trades asserts that the
law makes it a misdemeanor for failure
to include the eight-hour clause in . any
contract made by State, city or smaller
political divisions. . It is to reach a judi
cial determination of this question that
mandamus proceedings to compel the
Auditor to draw a warrant in Worthing
ton's f avof were decided upon at a con
ference yesterday. The threatened arre3t
of the City Attorney Is based upon tho
theory that he drew the contract now in
dispute.
OAKLAND. Dec. 29â The Grand
Jury, irr-paneled to-day, has been
directed by Superior Judge Wil
liam E. Greene to Investigate the
charges which were made by
Fiipportors of Henry P. Dalton that the
lncicunent of the County Assessor by the
preceding: Grand Jury was the result of
corrupt use of that Grand Jury by sup
porters 01 Congressman Victor H. Met
calf. In an exhaustive review to the
Grand Jury of the events of last summer
leading up to the Dalton indictment Judge
Greone declares that the circumstances of
the charges were of such public notoriety
that he has called them to the attention
of the body now officially organized. His
Honor said the charges were an attack
upon the Grand Jury, and thÂ«.t because
It was aa attack the present Grand Jury
should make the Investigation. On the
01 her hand Judge Greene declares that if
the charges are unfounded and were
made for political effect the Grand Jury
Â¦which indicted Dalton should be exoner
ated and the people of the county given
that fact. If It exist.
Judge Greene's charge reopens* the en
tire subject of the Dalton accusations,
which were based upen an alleged de
struction of public records in the office
of the County Assessor, namely, memor
anda used in the making of personal prop
erty assessment rolls. It was charged
in the indictment that the Assessor had
drstroved books containing the per
sonal property roll of the city of Oakland
and used in the compiling of the final
roll turned over to the Supervisors. It was
tlso charged that the Assessor had
omitted from the final roll assessments
v/'iicn were contained in the books al
lied to have been destroyed. The ac
cusation followed the same line?. Both
wore handed down on June 7 last.
Km soon as the Grand Jury's action was
rrade public there was a groat stir In
political circles. Dalton had opened a
csni!iai"Ti in opposition to Congressman
MetcalC for the nomination for Congress
for the Third District. The supporters of
Palton immediately started the cry that
t!i<? indictment and accusation were pro
moted by political enemies, and that the
nineteen members of the Grand Jury had
bren used to bring discredit upon-the As^
F*>ssor. The grand jurors who were thus
attacked came to the front with hot de
rials, dttclarins they had acted as they
iKlieved -the evidence before them war
ranted. It had befn known among the
tioiiticiar.s that Dalton's office was under
3r.vcsti?ation, but none was prepared for
the explosion the filing of the indictments
caused.
Araor.fr those who were assailed because
â¬>' the Grand Jury's indictments was

ALAMEDA. Dec. 29.â The frightful
death by burning which overtook four
year-old Ethel Lambert last jiight was
the result of the child's fondness for flre.
On former occasions she was only saved
from death by the intervention of rela
tives. In spite of the precautions taken
yesterday to keep her out of the neigh
bor's house where there was a Christmas
tree she gained an entrance in some un
known way, played with the tire and lost
her life. .
Little Ethel's mother was ill at her
home, 412 Taylor avtnue, when the acci
dent occurred. She was being attended
by Mrs. J. A. Branson of 422 Taylor ave
nue, who also has a. four-year-old child
named Percy. Whnn Mrs. Bronson left
her home, about 4 o'clock, to call upon
Mrs. Lambert she left her son and the
baby Kthel playing in front of her ot*u
home. Before she left she look precau
tions to keep tho children out of the
house. -
During Mrs. Bronson's absence the tots
got into the rear yard in some incon
ceivable way. They went into the" house
through the kitchen door, which Mrs.
Bronson had left unlocked. The children
made their way into the front parlor to
find the Christmas tree. Â¦â¢ It had only one
candle on it. This they secured by getting
upon a chair. They took matches from
the kitchen, lighted the candle and had
a good time. The remains of a Christmas
tree apple which they were roasting with
the candle is mute evidence of the joy
that preceded the tragedy.
Just how Ethel's clothes caught flre is
rot known. In her u:oments of agony she
blamed it upon her companion. He says,
that she set herself on fire. But the ex
planations of the infants cannot be relied
upon. I
When Percy saw Ethel all aflame he
gave the alarm and Elmer Lambert, the
eight-year-old brother of the baby girl,
ran to her rescue. He took off his coat
to wrap around the child to smother the
burning clothing. *.flien he dashed water
upon her.
When the father of the child, who was
home with, his sick wife, was summoned
to the scene he beheld his child standing
and clutching a windowsill, with every
vestige of clothing burned off her! body,
which was covered with burns from head
to foot. He put her into a bed .and sum
moned Dr. Jacob Green. Later she was
taken to the Alameda Sanatorium, where
she died at midnight.
The parents of the dead child say that
it was almost impossible to keep matches
out of her reach. She delighted in being
around a fire and struck matches when
ever she could get hold of them. A short
time since she started, a blaze In her
father's workshop, nearly setting herself
and the building on fire. Once before
there was another such narrow escape.
The Coroner held an Inquest over the
remains of the child to-day. The verdict
was accidental death.

"If you please, sir, here's the messenger
boy," fald my maid with a emlle the other
afternoon as she ushered into my room
a neatly dressed and not ill-looking young
girl, says a writer in the IÂ»n(ion Klnc
At first I thought there must be some
mistake, but her ladyship soon disabused
me of that notion, and with a good deal
of self-posaesslon. . but no trace of '" for
wardness, informed me that she was dis
charging mepnenger boy's duty. She. took
my telegram and the money therefor with,
the customary "tuppence for the met
sag-e. please." and I. have -no doubt ac
quitted herself of the not very onerous
task of bearing it to the postofflce as
featly as the human boy would have done.
But the next time I passed the office I
made inquiries, and was told that it was
only in a few Â¦ of the West End .\ officer
that the experiment of ' using young girls
instead of boys wan being tried, and that
even in these districts they were only
used when the duty-was a fitting one for
a girl to undertake. The fact is. the clerk
in charge assured me. the company finds
it impossible to get a sufficient supply of
boys.They have lately been enforced to
employ men at sixpence an hour at some
of- the city offices, and when the Gov
ernment royalty is taken Into account this
docs not leave much of a profit .for ;the
company. I hear the cable companies
are also at their wits' end to find messen

Aurora Lodge No. 202 of the Knights and
Indies of Honor haa arranged to have its
officers Installed in public on the evening

James A. Garfleld Corps.
James A. Garfield Corps of the W. R. C.
of the Grand Army of the Republic had
a holiday festival last Thursday night
in the social hall of the Alcazar for the
benefit of Its fund for the relief of the
veterans of the War of the Rebellion.
There was a very pleasing programme of
entertainment that was varied with
dances. Each one who entered the room
was presented by the corps with a token
of its hospitality. - Mrs. Dora H. Wilklns
was the floor manager and the commit
tee of arrangements consisted of Mes
dames N. V. Van Horn, Sarah Wilson and
Tina McGowan. This corps has done a
great deal in tho line of work in which
it Is engaged: relieving the wants of the
needy old soldiers who fought for the
preservation of the Union and those de
pendent upon them. <3Bfli

The Eschscholtzias.
The Kschscholtzlas gave their last par
ty of the century last Thursday night in
Mission Parlor Hall. The hall was dec
orated with exquisite simplicity and what
was lacking tn gaudy display on walls,
stage and ceiling was made up by the
beauty of the great number of sparkling
eyed young ladies who .took part in the
whirl of the many dances on the pro
gramme. The social functions of this or
ganization are. month by month, becom
ing more popular with those who are fo
fortunate as to be on the list of theinvita
bles. Every invitation prepared Is passed
upon -by a committee, so that none shall
go out that might fall into the hands. of
undesirable individuals. The aim of the
officers is to make the gatherings select
in the extreme. The officers of the even
ing were: Floor manager, 'J. D. Hede
mann; assistant floor manager, Guy Rog
ers; floor committeeâ R. Abel, A. Theuer
kauf. A. Rewig: reception committee-
George Boyd, T. O'Brien, W. Barry; ar

Knights of the Golden Eagle.
California" Castle No. 1 of the Knights
of the Golden Eagle on last 'Friday night
had a very enjoyable Christmas festival,
upon which occasion George P. Peterson,
acting as Santa Clauv donated to a num
ber of children present a token by which
to' remember the event and. then to each
member a gift that In each case was a
perfect misfit, as it was something that
the recipient had no earthly u^e for. The
distribution waÂ» followed by dancing. D.
Hanna, C. Miller and W. O. Macdougall
were the committee in charge.
Independent Foresters.

Ing night fell on Christmas Court Yerba

To take a look backward first, over the
I ast year's musical programme, to paut? |
thereby th<* present standard of apprecia- !
:!on. De Paehmann. in some very well
attended' piano recitals, was the first art
ist of importance to be heard during the
last twelve months. Antoinette Trebelli
came next, with her admirable song re
citals, which were continually more
crowded with each programme given. The
'Â»raJT combination, which came shortlv
efterward; Damrosch. Gadski and BSs
rham. in Illustrated Wagnerian lectures,
acquired the popularity cf a fad; and a
very successful symphony concert, under
Mr. namresch's baton, wa* alsÂ«o given
during their visit. Three grand opera sca
pons are the operatic tale of the year.
The unfortunate Azzail Italian Opera
Company, which came to the California,
with its excellent soloists and wretched
chorus, received quite adequate support.
The Tivoli's grand opera stason. the most
cuceessful cf its seven years' offerings in
this direction, was patronized up to the
last nisrhi of its eighteen weeks' pro
gramme In amply satisfactory fashion.
And lastly, on which fact we must now
cea$e congratulating ourselves, the never
to-be forgotten Grau grand opera was ap
preciated, artlEtically and financially. In j
a fashion which lifts us to the same level j
in this repard as Boston, Chicago and ;
even New York.

Of clever folk of our own who were
heard here. Row Relda's two concerts ,
xvere perhaps most successful. Anna Mil
ler Wood also gave a number of 6ong re
citals, eminently successful from an ar
tistic standpoint, but for some reason or
ether financially a failure. Clara Kalish
er was also heard in recital, and among j
those who are to be always with us, Fred- ]
Â«>riek Bigger-staff, Karry G. Samuels, Mrs. !
Oscar Mansfoldt and Hother Wismer gave I
recitals of much interest. The child won- j

The Symphony Society seems practical
ly dead. There is only one guarantor,
Mrs. Hearst. The musicians are all here,
but there is no conductor upon whom
all are agreed. Scheel has left us for bril
liant successes in Philadelphia. Hlnrlchs
is with Macdowell at the head of the or
chestral department in his college. Pro
fessor Holmes and Max Hirschfeld are
thÂ« orly possible symphony leaders here,
and to neither Is given the necessary al
lcglar.ee by the symphony going public.
The musicians themselves are unwilling
to make the necessary sacrifice of time
and money to further the interest of the
orchestra. Last year the trades union
rates were raised approximately from $3
to $8 per man per concert, and in addition
the exceptional instrumentalist charged
all the traffic would bear for his services
from $15 to $36 per concert. It Is a short
sighted policy, and in face of such condi
tions generally it is little wonder that
the symphony management has laid down
its work with hardly the least wish to re
sume it.

fornia Theater for this evening, Monday,

The wisdom of the changed regime of
the Mlnettl Quartet concert." was amply
demonstrated the other evening on its
first inauguration at the fourth concert
of this season's series. I>iscouragÂ«d by
the sparsely filled houses at the beginning 1
cf the season. Mr. Minetti decided to place
the concerts nn a purely subscription ba
sis, and, further, to plve them in the
evening instead of afternoon. The pro
cramme grlvt-n was interesting- as usual,
thouch no novelties were Introduced. The
TschaJkowsky D major quartet, with its
charming Andanteâ familiar to us throuph
the Scheel arrangementâ went exceedingly
well. The Ippolltofr-Ivanoff "Intermezzo"
and "Humoresca," two movements from
the r.ew A min. quartet Introduced at
the season's beginning, were repeated,
and apain enjoyably heard, and the
Smetana piano trio in O min. ended the
programme. A big number Is this latter,
picturesque, colorful, broad, a little sen
sational perhaps in device, but no end
interesting:.
The next concert on January 11 will
include a new Afanassleft quartet.

"What kind of poetry flo you like beat?"
And the man with bent shoulders and
a weary eye never looked up from his
desk as he answered:
"TypeTCTltten."â Washington Star.
TheVolga Is the largest river In Eu
rope and the Casplanr Into which it emp
ties, Is the largest inland body of water
in the world, but neither has a natural
connection with the ocean. Freight from
the Casplan'muy go all the way eithet to
the Arctic Ocean or. to the Baltic by
means of canals that connect the Voiga
with navigable] rivers flowing: either into
the northern or^ the eastern seas; but in
order to reach the ocean from the Caspian
by either of these two canal routes it Is
necessary to cross the whole of Russia
from" its southeastern' corner, and the
routes' are very lorrg, roundabout and
therefore expensive.
People who have followed the progress
of the industrial development of Russia
have long wondered why. the Caspian has
not long ago been : connected with the
Black Sea. This union might be effected
by digging a caral between the lower Vol
ga and the lower Don at the point where
they very nearly approach one another.
The country between them Is almost per
fectly flat except for the high hills that
Bklrt the western bank of the Volga for
Eome hundreds'- of miles. If it had not
been for this chain of hills it is probable
that the Volga-Don canal ' would have
been in operation years ago.
It Is now proposed to dig this canal. The
distance is only sixty miles, the plans
have been made ' and ; the estimated . cost
is about $33,000,000. The effect of this canal
upon transportation In Russia and; a part
of Asia would lie far-reaching. It will give
Russian Central Asia and Northern Persia
water communications from the Caspian
to the ocean without involving- a Journey
northward of from 700 to 1000 miles, and it
will give the Volga, to which the most of
Central and Eastern Siberia are tributary,
an outlet to the Black Sea:
The canal will be certain to cause an im
portant diversion of Russian trade to tho
Black Sea. Three canals now connect the
Volga with the Baltic, and many hundreds
of freight boats Â¦ make the . journey * every
year between the river, and St. Peters
burg. The s Volga carries about half the
rl-^er freight of Russia; and much of this
freight is drawn from the country trlbu
.tary to the lower half of, the river, which
is much nearer the - Black > Sea than the
Baltic. The Volga-Don canal 1 will there
fore tend to make the Black Sea more im
portant than .ever as the main outlet of
the agricultural . exports of Russia.â New

But Monte Carlo la well served on the
whole. The chef de partie, who had no
ticed that all the heavy betting remained
faithful to red, even after it had won five,
six, seven times in succession, counted the
cards later on and found thirty too many.
The unfaithful croupier was conducted to
the director, and after being passed
through the third - degree, arrested.
Brought up before the Monaco tribunal,
he was condemned to eighteen months of
prison.
"The evening of the bomb" will remain
historic in the annals of llonte Carlo.
Four high-class confidence operators, of
whom two were said to be English or
American, conceived the idea of getting
away with one of the trente-et-quarante
table's stack of 1000 franc notes. The
play at this game is much higher than
that at roulette, not only because of its
lower rake-off, but because of its higher
maximum, 12,000 francs ($2400) and . the
factâ weighty with those who believe in
such thingsâ that, once the six packs are
shuffled and cut, no chance event, like
that of a gold piece falling into a roulette
cylinder or the "Jumping" of a roulette
ball, can risk breaking "the series." The
tenacity with which many. poker players
hold to drawing their "right cards" In
the case of a turn-up arises from Just
such a consideration.
Well, these four conspirators thought
that they might get at the 150,000 francs
In big notes that each trente-et-quarante
table Is pretty sure to have in bank along
toward 10 o'clock at night. Each table
starts with this sum in gold and notes,
and winning it, with Its accumulations or
less its diminutions, constitutes "breaking
the bank." Constructing a bomb, princi
pally of loose powder enveloped in caout
chouc, they furnished it with a concealed
spiral fuse and introduced It into the large
gaming hall hidden in the high silk hat
of one of the conspirators. The others
sought places near the principal croupier
at a prosperous trente-et-quarante table,
convenient to the bank roll, and gave the
signal. He of the bomb and. plug hat,
watching his opportunity, deposited the
hat, with the bomb in it, on . the large
mantelpiece in the center of the hall, lit
It with a cigar that he had kept. palmed
for the purpose, and coolly strolled away.
Suddenly a formidable explosion filled the
casino with clouds of thick smoke and in
describable alarm. .
Hats were smashed, coats torn, gowns
ripped and gas brackets loosened. .The
four conspirators had calculated that, be
sides creating great clouds of smoke, the
explosion would put out the lights.
Happily for the bank the gas only, went
out. The petroleum lamps., which are re
tained for double safety, despite the
march of improvement, continued feebly
to light the scene. They made light
enough for the cool-headed croupiers,
who, faithful to their trust, stood on the
alert to guard the bank roll. ' There was a
dash madeâ and two of the conspirators
were taken into custody. That , they tore
away the next moment and escaoed is
only a detail. '" H TTlMIBIlp' 'Â¦" "WrajOTnifflm
The band of eighteen .Italians .who, a
few. years ajro, won the Â£00,000 s francs in
one month from the; bank, owed, their
: good fortune not so much to active as to
passive fraud. They bet on the physical
1 defects of â¢ a particular. roulette.-, .Was it
fraud? Â¦';Â¦Â¦ The Casino people thought < so,
though they could not see Â¦ their ' way to
' prosecuting the , offenders. Perhaps it
i would be best to call it an Indelicacy.
i In any case, these Italian geniuses â¢ be
pan by observing; that-the roulette*ma
chine at table number 2 ; had a manifest
At the moment when the attention of all
was distracted, one of the syndicate
slipped into the unfaithful tailleur's hand,
on top of the other cards he held, several
similar cards arranged to make red win
eight times in succession. The game
started up again. The syndicate bet on
red, and, in the space of a few minutes,
relieved the Monte Carlo bank of 700,000
francs, or $140,000. ,
The syndicate was made up of an ex
croupier at the time operating a clende3
tlne roulette at Nice; a man without pro
fession, his woman friend, an employe of
the ex-croupier and five other individuals
of the same morality, who got away. The
60,000 francs capital Of the syndicate was
divided equally among the nine, who sta
tioned themselves around their partner's
table. "When it came his turn to take the
bank they made ready. He gave the sig
nal. Immediately three or four of his
associates demanded gold for 1000 franc
notes from the three other croupiers of
the table. At the same instant tne lady,
who had remained standing, let fall to
the floor a handfuil of gold twenty-franc
pieces. It stopped the game, because
many of the players had to make room
for the servants to pick up the coins.
A little before Christmas, 1899, when
Nice and Monte Carlo had filled up wllh
their sporting cosmopolitan winter popu
lations, one of the trusted employes of
the bank, a croupier, made a combination
with nine other Christmas money-seekers
to defraud his own trente-et-quarante
table.
The next morning, however, it was M.
Boulant's turn to be surprised. Entering
the salon a few hours after their opening,
he found the Italians at their accustomed
places, playingâ and winning â as if noth
ing had happened. He was more than
surprised a moment after, when, on care
ful examination, he discovered that the
unlucky cylinder had been brought back.
Who had replaced It? It mattered little,
and the traitor in the camp was never
discovered. An order was Issued for the
guilty machine to be broken up into kind
ling wood, the syndicate ceased betting
on Its chosen numbers, and the bank
ceased losing 13,000 francs a day at table
No. 2.â Philadelphia Inquirer.
The next morning the Italians entered
with a business-like briskness. They had
come to collect their income, as usual.
Seating themselves at table No. 2 they
prepared to play. All at once it was no
ticed that they hesitated. They exchanged
glances. They began consulting. They
re-examined the roulette cylinder with
furtive glances. Then they packed away
their gold and bank notes, got up and
strolled away, conversing earnestly. It
was equivalent to a confession. The syn
dicate was surprised into committing an
error. It ought to have continued play
ing.
The Italians had been observed by this
time. They were known to be the guilty
âwinners. Had they found a sure-wln
ningr system? The administration laughed
at the idea. It was remarked, neverthe
less, that the Italians always played at
the same table, and always on the single
numbers en plein or a cheval. This awak
ened the suspicions of the administrator,
M. Boulant, and caused him, later in the
day, to do what would be done after a
week's bad luck at present. He ordered
the unlucky roulette cylinder to be put
aside. Another was substituted; and they
sat down to watch the result.

closing. At the beginning the chef de
partle, the croupiers, the lookouts, spies
and detectives who are banded around
each table to protect it. paid no attention
to them. After several days, however,

big sums and looking Indifferently on phe
nomenal mns of luck, the bank's protec
tors began worrying. Night after nig-ht
they were bringing back no profits lo the

heavy losses. They themselves asked to
be changed from table No. 2, which they
i declared to be hoodoced. A new set of
croupiers and watchers was put In their
place. Still table No. 2 continued losing

The first of Maine's two six masted
schooners, the George \V. Wells, launched
at Camden on August 14, has been rigged,
fitted out and towed to sea, and by this
time she must have reached -one of the t
coal ports to take in her first cargo. The |
second six-master, says the Belfast, Me., !
correspondent of the Chicago Inter-Ocean, J
1b still on tne stocks at Bath, and will De |
launched in a few weeks. Unusual Inter
est is felt in her, not only because she is
a rival of the Camden giant, but also be
cause she is to be commanded by tne
smartest skipper on the coast. Captain
Lincoln Jewett of South Portland, famil
iarly known all along shore as "Line"
Jewett.
When he was a fisherman, sailing a lit
tle smack out' of Portland, he gave the
fish dealers there a turn which made their
eyes stick out. One cold and blustery
day in winter he came into Portland with
a good fare 'Of -fish and found the market
bare. The weather had been so bad that
no one could get anywhere or catch any
thing, and so it looked like a harvest time
for Captain Line with his good fare. The
flsh dealers, however, thought differently.
They argued that the weather was so
stormy that Jewett would have to stay
In Portland and dispose of his fare there
at whatever price .was offered, and so
they made a pool, agreeing to pay only a
certain price, with the understanding that
the flsh should be divided among them.
But the scheme, didn't work. Captain
Jewett told them all to go to thunder,
and, to the amazement of all hands, got
under way in a howling snowstorm for
Gloucester, where he arrived' all right and
got a high price for his fare. The Port
land fish dealers never tried after that to
get the better of Captain Jewett. "There's
no tellin' what the crltter'fi do," said one
of them. And there wasn't.
Once Captain Line astonished the ship
ping world by a feat that is without a
parallel in the annals of the coasting
trade. There was a great scarcity of coal
in Portland, one winter a few years ago,
and the Notman was one of a fleet of
lourteen sailbound to Portland from vari
ous places with the much wanted fuel.
They had bad weather coming down from
the capes of the -Delawarer-and when a
furious storm came up most of them went
into Vineyard Haven or some other har
bor of refuge Captain Jewett, however,
was in no mood for loafing in harbors. He
knew that if he got into Portland with
the whole fleet he might have to wait for
weeks to get discharged, so he kept right
along, regardless of the weather. So it
was that, while the other vessels were
reported as' "arrived" at the Vineyard,
the Charles P. Notman was reported in
this way:
"Passed schooner Charles P. Notman
Jewett. Newport News for Portland."
"Passed!" That little word in the Vine- !
ya,rd ship news made, the owners of the
Notman look thoughtful, for they knew
what the weather was. â¢ while sailormen
declared that "Line" Jewett was crazy,
sure enough. The snowstorm continued,
with a howling northeaster to spin It
along, and the next afternoon, after pass
ing the Vineyard, the Charles P. Notman
flew in by Portland Head like a towering
snow bank. The lightkeeper stared when
she went by, as If he had seen an 'appari
tion, and when the big schooner came
tearing up the harbor the few longshore
men who happened to be about were as
1 tonished. Up she came with everything
on her and rounded to. off the coal docks.
Then, to the amazement of all who saw-
It, Captain Jewett actually- docked her
without the aid of a tugâ he just brought
hereto and backed her 'into her berth.
' When he got there all the berths were
Â¦ empty and all the stevedores loafing, so
that he got quick dispatch in discharging,
i Two days afterward, on his return trip,
1 when he was running down by Cape Cod.
â¢ he met all the rest of the fleet coming
I up. and: made, a few cheerful remarks to
: such of them as passed within hall con
! cernlng quick passages, loafing in harbors
. and getting- around the world generally,
i Had he waited In the vineyard for good
â¢ weather he would have got Into Portland
: with the bunch, and, as vessels have to
; take. thoir turn in discharging, he might
, have had to wait two weeks qr more be
fore he got .the coal out of the Charles P.
â¢ Notman.'
j It was by such performances as this
> that "Line" Jewett climbed the ladder of
i succrss from s the 'little fishing smack to
' the four-master. ; He has been successful
. in other "ways, too, and now he is to be
i commander, of one of the two wonders of
> the. shipping, worldâ the first two slx
- masted schooners ever built.â New York

M3NINO STOCXH.*
NEW YORK. Deo. 29.â Last nteht New York
Phoned noro svmptoms of alarm over the ru
mTB of financial difficulri^s in London than
Iv>nrlon iti>elf had done. This morning the New
York market "gave about 15 minutes to active
buying to overcome the rather sharp declines
In the international stocks which had resulted
fr^m the unsettled condition of affairs In Lon
don, rrojvlng out of the announcement of act
ual failure!", resulting from the gamble In West
Australian* and their subsequent slump. The
low^r prices here Eppmed an attraction in
themselves and the aggrepsively pustalned ad
vance in St. Paul on renewed rrports of the
entry* of J. J. Hill Into an active <Â»hare in the
management of the company and of alliances
Â¦with other Northwest reads was a stimulating
Influence throughout the whole list. The buy
ing of St. Paul itself was on a very large scale
and the prices rose to 147, leaving the previous
record price far behind. The market cold off a
little before the bank statement, but renewed
strength appeared on the showing made by the
banks, the expansion in loans being more than
provided for by the Increase In reserves ot
nearly S6,0>jQ,COO, which was considerably more
than expected. The principal strength of the
marke twas in high-grade railroad stocks. The
high-priced members of the anthracite group
were conspicuous. The Northwestern stocks
wore buoyant, but the other grangers failed to
show much sympathy with St. Paul, Northern
Paciflc, Union Pacific, Illinois Central, Â¦ the
trunk lines, American Express, Wells Fargo,
the Rubber stocks. National Tube, and after
early weakness Sugar and Brooklyn Rapid
Transit were all stronc features, the advances
running from 2 to 5 point*. There were weak
ppots in Che li*t under the pressure of persistent
profit-taking, but prices were' above the early
low point, and the realizing wan weil absorbed.
There have been lingering apprehensions dur
int; the short week in the stock market that the
much-dreaded money squeeze might: after all.
eventuate during the last week of the year and
topple over prices under the rush to realize
profits. There has, in fact, been enormous
realizing on every day and influential profes
sional operators have testified their confidence
that the rise in price.* had culminated by fre
quently putting out short lines. But the as
tonishing absorptive power of the markets has
taken up offerings from all Hources with unua
lialf-d voracity, seeking out constantly new
stocks for favors, end shifting profltb from one
(juarter of the market to the other. The Judg
ment of professional operators has been contin
ually at fault and the bears have been forced
to coyer their short contracts day after day,
helping on the notable' rallies from the occa
sional periods of reaction. There has been a
growing 1 perception that all ordinary rules and
standards are quite inadequate to apply to the
present stock market. Not only are Individual
or syndicate oixrations on an unprecedented
fccale, but the dissemination of interest through
the General world uf- capital takes the market
beyend the bounds of the ordinary manipulative
processes of Stock ExehanRe operators and spec
ulative cliquey. The looked-for money squeeze
is about the only prospect that could be relied
upon to check the determination to buy etocks,
and money has continued easy in spite of the
preparations for the yearly bettlements and the
enormous requirements of the unbridled spec- 1
ulation. The widely diffused public sentiment
has apparently continued well satisfied with
the prices paying for stocks and convinced of the
value of their possessions, and there have not
been lacking signs of continued buying by
banking interests in furtherance of plans of
consolidation of control. The efforts by profes
sional operators to work reactions have, there- j
fore, been uniformly defeated. It Is a truism
that so long, as the public maintains Its confi
dence In the value of stocks and has money !
with which to buy prices will continue to ad
vance. But it is worth while considerinr that
tbe fact of the advance is the attraction for the
general public to buy while that buying Is in
turn the cause of the advance. Â»
There has been increasing- Interest in railroad
bonds of lower grade issues and the volume of
dealings has approached high-record figures.

Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ : Â»
CHICAGO, Dec. 29.â For twÂ» and a half ac
tive, strenuous hours, the .'usual duration of
the Saturday session, the market displayed an
effervescent spirit. During the first hour there
wai more ,gj>eculatlve business than. during the
whole (session of any other day this week. The
first symptoms of buoyancy and strength
brought back from the alluring stock market
mar.y deserters from the grain pit. May wheat
opened unchanged at 73*4, but quickly respond
ed to" buying orders from all Bides of the pit.
May' advanced, growing more active as it
Roared, until 75%c was bid. Over 74c offerings
wore a bit fieer, but they quickly ceased when
the ; breadth of the demand became apparent
and not until the price was well over 75c did
tho selling pressure assume sufficient weight to
affect prices. From the top May eased off to.
74%c, but here the clamor of shorts was re
newed and a recovery ensued. May closing 1 7 4
ff?2c over yesterday at 75H@75Uc The founda
tion of the market's strength lay In the recent
stubborn firmness of foreign markets and to
a greater degree in the falling off In North
wtstern receipt*. .
Corn was fairly active and firm, but owed
meet of Its strength to the substantial rise in
wheat. May corn closed %lf%c higher.
The oats market at times was fairly , active
under covering, by shorts, but at. the clone the â¢
Important short lines were Intact. May oats

The P'Inancler says: If the Associated Bank's
report for the coming month's receipts of cur
rency equal the - January remittances that
usually now. In .this direction, the fears of a
light money market may well be dissipated.
As the situation stands at present, the position
of the banks Is easy and, despite the heavy
addition to reserve requirements necessitated
by crowing loans and deposits, the surplus Is
increasing. I>urlng the week Just ended loans
expanded $9,358,500, which, considering the facia
that business virtually began on Wednesday,
Is an extraordinary showing. It is probably
safe to eay that the loan expansion reflects the
present tendency of this item, in a somewhat
belated manner. 'The gain in cash was $5,87 1.
100, due to treasury disbursements for interest
and pensions and Interior bank remittances,
the latter having: been Increased heavily by rea
son of dividend requirements. But aside from
this money is f owing- to New York; ' not . only
in response to usual conditions, but also on ac
count of attractive opportunities afforded banks
to make use of their funds here. This has been
a feature for some time and probably. will con
tinue until checked automatically, by Interest
rate regulations. The deposits, owing to heavy
loan and cash increases, ran up in excess of
$15,000,000, thus contracting to a large extent
the cash gains. Still the surplus reserve Is
$2,000,000 higher than a week ago and stands at
$11,525,900 or almost the figure with which the
banks opened the year. It Is Interesting to
note that during the year now ending the clear
ing house banks of New York have increased
their loans $118,660,200; deposits, $105,236,100, and
cash- holdings, $26,077,200; this, too, after hav
ing met the heaviest demands ever known over
the crop season. In the twelve months now
closing the surplus reserve - touched $30,000,000
only once, has been In excess of *S0.0OO,OO9 only
fourteen weeks and under $10,000,000 for the
Fame number of weeks. This chows at a glance
that the banks have found constant employ
ment for their fund?, although the general
totals have ruled higher tb&n. ever before.
Since March last the national- banks of the
city have nearly doubled their circulation, the
present total standing at $31,000,000, This
money assisted materially as a regulating fac
tor during tb* somewhat stringent period two
months ago.

shrinking, beginning with the collapse" of val
ues, not only for tha : Stock â¢ Exchange,* but for
coai, Iron - and - textiles. Â»'The, effect must be
to : seriously impugn banking credit. - The Gov
ernment is , steadily- pulling: away our means
and 'Is still unable to cope with' Its liabilities.
The burden of Increased war ' taxation ' begins
to press severely upon the ; community, whose
Incomes . already have ' been curtailed by the
derangement of business ; which the Â¦ fighting
has caused. Owing to the holidays, the week's
business on thswstock - Exchange waa small,
the tone, however, beings wonderfully good in
most directions, without - adequate reason be
ing assigned. . . â¢ .
India-was -a steady purchaser of silver
throughout the ' week : and the position of the
India currency, department "points to heavy
purchases' at", a -not far distant date.
Money from New York will be plentiful at
the opening of the year with active stock mar
kets. The fall in silver to: 29V4d, the Statist
ascribes to American pressure for sales for
cash, but adds that immediately after the
year's , turn American holders -will no longer
press, sales and that a sharp recovery, is antici
pated; ':'-'. Â¦-â¢
NEW YORK. Dec. 29.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: '
The failure of thirteen houses with . twenty
nine members of. the exchanges. Involved in
the complete, collapse of the. West Australian
and British Columbian Financing, palled upon
the whole market here to-day, and the trouble
Is not over. About a dozen more failures are
expected on- Monday. ' All attention Â¦ was ab-
Eorbed by this disaster and many heavy sales
were induced by It, though there is no reason
why the trouble should extend beyond the
group concerned. . .
Even the - American department . was Influ
enced somewhat by* it, and the selling there
put prices down *4 point or so. Besides thin
local trouble It Is quite generally said that
the American market Is getting to be top
heavy. After the opening fairly good buying
wae observed, nevertheless, and the close for
Americans were much better, especially for the
better grade shares. Money was steady.
Of gold Â£50,000 was taken for export to India;
Â£65,000 to Paris, and Paris li expected to take
a pretty fair quantity in January.

Judge subpena the defendants to bÂ« In

as to the agreement, but the Judge said
he would not do bo.
"I do not know anything officially about
any stipulation," said the Judge, "and as
the cases have been continued from time
to time by consent, and the record shows
that the defendants pleaded not guilty
and demanded a Jury, I must abidÂ» by tha
record."

low head and large volume of water

carry out their part of the agreement

Judge Fritz's court. Attorney Collins was
present for the defendants, and he asked
that the cases be set for trial by jury at
as early a date as possible.
Attorney Coffey, the special prosecutor,
referred to the agreement made between
Collins' clients and the Chief of Police,
but Collins said he had been all along

tim as Is the Average Pug.
"It Is a peculiar fact," said Detective
Frank D. Mitchell the other day, "that'
the general public has an entirely erro
neous idea as to the nature and charac
teristics of the bloodhound. The popular
opinion is that he is a oeast of giant
frame and unusually ferocious, with a
penchant for eating the criminal whom
he has brought to bay. Another common
error is that he can follow a scent in
ceflnitely, through a thousand sinuosities,
though It may be Intersected by any num
ber of other trails.
"The average bloodhound Is no more
to be dreaded, so far as his flerceneas is
concerned, than a pug. He is a gaunt
rawboned creature, with a head running
to a peak; sleepy eyes and long, pendu
lous ears. As to disposition, he is lazy.
His usefulness lies chiefly In the keenness
ot his olfactory nerves, enabling him to
follow $. fresh scent many miles. He sel
dom touches his quarry when run to
earth, however, and never does unless
starved to it. The bloodhound differs from
the English foxhound, in that he never
'gives tongue' or bays while following a
scent.
"Bloodhounds are not of much use in
tracking criminals in a city, or where
there is comparatively dense population,
as the numerous cross-trails confuse
them. This was demonstrated last winter
when we were hunting two negroes named
Will Tony and Sam Barnette. The people
of Benson had been complaining of chick
en thieves. Almost every night some hen
coop in that suburb of Omaha would be
looted and finally Detective Drummy and
I were detailed to work up the case. We
put in several days on it without landing
our man, and the aggravating part of it
was that the thefts were going right on,
even while we were hunting for the crim
inals. Well, eventually we . decided to
adopt heroic measures. We had a con
sultation with several prominent citizens
of Benson, and the result was we sent to
Beatrice for a pack of .bloodhounds. '
"We kept the dog* In hiding, until there
was. another raid on a hencoop, and then,
bright and early one morning the hounOs
were put on a fresh trail. They followed
It about a quarter of a mile and finally
came to a standstill on the front porch
of a house in the outskirts of the village
"The family that lived in this house
bore a good reputation, but we decided to
go in anyhow and make an investigation.
We searched everywhere, from cellar to
garret, but there was no sign of a stolen
chicken. Not even a feather could be
found on the premises. Then we took the
dogs back to the starting: point and had
them go over the trail again, and again
they wound up on the front porch of* the
same house. Try as we Â¦would we could
n't get the beasts to leave that place.
The trail seemed to end there. If the
thieves had gone up In a balloon at that
point they couldn't have obliterated their
tracks more effectually. So the dogs were
declared a failure and were sent back to
Beatrice. , -
"Latef we succeeded in catching Tony
and Bafnette red-handed, with the evi
dence of their guilt upon them, and they
confessed. I have never been able to ex
plain to my own satisfaction why the trail
left off so abruptly on the porch of that
particular house. There is a tradition
comes , up from the ' South, a survivor of
the ante-bellum days, that' if a .fleeing
slave tied sliced ,, onions upon the soles of
his feet the hounds could not track him.
Perhaps that is what Barnette Â¦ and Tony
did on the "piazza of that houseâ I don't
know."â Omaha Bee.

THE California State Federation
Convention which meets In Pion
eer Hall on January 7 will be one
of the most important and signifi
cant gatherings of organized la
bor ever assembled in the history of Cali
fornia. A caT. issuing from the San Fran
cisco Labor Council has been sent to
every eligible trade union In the State.
The cr.ly restriction placed upon the ad
mission of unions is that they shall be
affiliated with the chartered Labor Coun
cil in their \icinity where such a union
exists.
The principal work before the conven
tion will be the formation of a perma
nent State Federation. In addition It is
expected that certain legislative meas
ures, such as the anti-injunction, anti
child labor, employment agency, employ
er's liability and blower system bills
which have already been indorsed by a
large number of the local labor bodies
will be discussed and steps taken to se-
cure their enactment into laws by th.
Legislature. *
It is the intention of those in charge of
the convention to have it perfectly free
m Â«? n v l u l l l oi PÂ° litlc s. It is intended
that it shall be a purely labor gathering
organized on purely labor llnef. and its
aim will be to unite the legitimate pow

of the industrial interests of the State

COMING LABOR CONVENTION TVILL BE LARGELY INSTRUMEN
TAL IN BRINGING IT TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE.
The retail clerks are meeting with suc
cess in their efforts to secure the early
of stores in this city. The great
majority of the merchants freely signified
their willingness to enter into an agree
ment to close on Sundays and also on
weekday evenings. There are still some
districts not thoroughly canvassed and
also some merchants in the districts
where the most work has been done who
are holding off, and special efforts are
now being directed to make early closing
general throughout the city. Many minis
ters are aiding the movement, and last
night the following letter was addressed
to those merchants who have agreed, to
close by the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil:
Dear Sir: Local No. 432 of the Retail Clerks'
International Protective Association, organ
ized by and now affiliated with the San Fran-
Cisco Labor Council, reported at last night's
session of the council that so far ninety lead
ing retail stores of this city had over their
signatures agreed to inaugurate on January
1, 1901, the shorter workday by closing their
establishments, daily at 6 p. m., except on
Saturday evenings, evenings preceding holi
days and evenings during the month of De
cember.
To further advance the Just and worthy
cause of early closing of storesâ a cause that
will permit both employer and employe to lead
better and broader livesâ the San Francisco
Labor Council elected last night a special
committee to render the full support of the
council to the clerks in their efforts to get
all competitive retail stores to close, thus In
suring the permanency of the movement while
hurting no man in his business.
This committee will Interview the few pro
prietors who have not yet signed the clerks'
agreement, urging them to comply with their
request, and, failing to get such compliance,
the committee will send the names of such
stores to the members of the unions of this
city and make them public otherwise, Â¦ the
committee being fully convinced that at the
present stage of civilization the public, once
its attention Is called to the matter, will
quickly convince these merchants that hu
mane hours of labor are Just and expedient,
and that it does not pay to retard the
growth of the community.
The secretary was instructed to communi
cate with all the merchants who signed the
agreement and assure them that the full and
individual strength of the labor movement will
be used to protect them against those who
believe that by keeping their stores open all
hours of the day and night they can get a
large share of patronage.

Interesting sermons, many of them
