VOLUME LXXXIX-XO. 4.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1900. t
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Good will prevails In our relations with the
German empire. An amicable adjustment of
the long pending question of the admission of
cur life Insurance companies to do business In
Prussia has been ' reached. One of the princi
pal, companies has already been readmitted
ana the way Is opened for the others to share
the privilege.
The aenttlement of the Samoan problem, to
which I adverted in my last message, has ac
complished good results. Peace and content
ment prevail In the Islands, especially in
Tutulla. where a convenient administration
that fr*Â« won the confidence and esteem of. the
kindly disposed natives haa been organized
tinder the direction of the commander of theÂ»
United States naval station at Pago-Pago.
An imperial treat Inspection law has been
enacted for Germany. While it may simplify
the inspections, it prohibits certain products
heretofore admitted. There is still great un
certalntly as to whether our well-nigh extin
guished German trade In meat products can
revive under Us new burderui. Much will ie
pend upon regulations not yet promulgated,
which we confidently hope will be free from the
discriminations which attended the enforce
ment of the old statutes.
The remaining link In the new lines of direct
telegraphic communication between the UnitÂ«J
States and the German empire haa recently
been completed, affording: a rratlfyiaa; occay
RELATIONS WITH GERMAlTi'.
the phenomenal demand for their output, not
alone at home, but also abroad, where merit
had already won a profitable trade.
Appeals had to be made to the patriotism of
exhibitors to Induce them to incur outlays,
promising no Immediate return. ThU was es
pecially the case where lt became needful to
complete an industrial sequence- or Illustrate
a class of processes. One manufacturer after
another had to be visited and importuned, and
at times, after a promise to exhibit la a par
ticular section having been obtained, lt would
bo withdrawn, owing to pressure of trade or
ders, and a new quest would have to be made.
The Installation of exhibits, too. encountered
many obstacles and Involved unexpected cost.
The exposition was far from ready at the date
fixed for its opening. The Frencn transporta
tion lines were congested with offered freight.
Belated goods had to be hastily installed in
unfinished quarters with whatever labor could
be obtained In the prevailing confusion. Nor
was the task of the commission lightened by
the fact that, owing to the scheme of classi
fication adopted, it was Impossible to have
the entire exhibit of any one country !n the
same building or more than one group of ex
hibits In the same part of any building. Our
Installations were scattered on both sides of
the Seine and In widely remote suburbs of
Paris, so that additional assistants were need-,
ed for the work cf supervision and arrange
ment.
Despite all these drawbacks, the contribution
of the United States was not only the largest
foreign display, but was among the earliest In
place and the most orderly In arrangement.
Our exhibits were shown. In one hundred and
one out of one hundred and twenty-one classes,
and more completely covered the entire classi
fication than those of any other nation. In
total number they ranked next afer these of
France, and the attractive form In which they
were presented secured general attentlcn.
A criterion of the extent and success of our
participation and of the thoroughness with
which our exhibits were organized is seen In
the awards granted to American exhibitors by
the International Jury, namely: Grand prises.
240: gold medals. S97: silver medals. 778; bronxe
medals, 541. and honorable mentions. C2 â 2474
In all, being the greatest total number given
to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation, as welt
as the largest number In each grade. This sig
nificant recognition of merit la competition
with the chosen exhibits of all other nations
and at the hands of Juries almost wholly made
up of representatives of France and other com
peting countries Is not only most gratifying,
but Is especially valuable, since lt sets us K
the front In international questions o'f supply
and demand, while the large proportion of
awards from the classes of art and artistic
manufactures afforded unexpected proof of thj
stimulation of national culture by the pros
perity that flows from natural productiveness
Joined to Industrial excellence.
Apart from the exposition, several occasions
for showing International good will occurred.
The Inauguration In Paris of the Lafayette
monument, presented r.y the schocl children of
the VTrlte-i States, and the designing of . a
commemorative ccin by our Mint and the pre
sentation of the first piece struck by the Presi
dent of the republic, were marked by apprc^
priate ceremonies, and the Fourth of July wai
especially observed in the French capital.

With the outgoing or t^e old and the incom

that love for lt and the determination to pre
frve it are more universal than at any former

The republic wts never so strong, berause
never eo ftrmcly intrenched In the hearts of

cf Its authors. The additions which have been

five. Then our territory consisted of - &QJ.Q.Â»O
square miles. It is now 3.E46.595 square miles.
Education, religion and morality have kept
pace with our advancement In other directions,
and while extending Its power the government
haa adhered to its foundation principles and
abated none of them in <SeÂ«llns with our new

' Etill'the peril increased, the legations report
ed the devplo'pment of the 'seditious -'movement
In Peking .'and, the need of Increased provision
for defense, against t lt. , While ' preparations
were '.In progress .for. a larger expedition, to
â¢ strengthen the legation guards and keep the
railway />pen;.an r attempt of the foreign ' shlpa
to^makÂ« a'landing .at Taku was met by flre
from the^Chfnese, forts.'. The forts were there
upon shelled by the foreign vessels, the Ameri
can" admiral taking* no part in the attack; on
the ground. that we. were not at war with China
and that a hostile" demonstration might consoli
date the ahtl-forelgn* elements and, strengthen
the Boxers . to oppose the relieving column.
Two days later, the Taku forts .we're captured
after a sanguinary conflict.. Severance of com
munication with Peking followed and a com
bined force of additional guards, which was
advancing to Peking by the Pelho, was checked
at Langfang. .The Isolation of the legations
was complete.
-The Chinese Government proved, however, un
able .to. check -the. rising strength of. the Boxers
and appeared t<> be a prey to internal dissen
sions. -. In the- unequal contest the anti-foreign
influences eoon' gained the ascendency under
the Iearfertrhii) of, Prince Tuan. Qrganlzed arm

affiliated. held_ the country between Peking and

China. : .
Â« Attacks, upon. foreigners, .lestructlon of prop
erty..and. slaughter of native converts were re
porte^. from . all sides. The Tsung LI Yamen,
already, permeated; with hostile sympathies,
could make.no effective response to the ap
peals or the" legations. At this critical Junc
ture., in- the early', spring of this year, a pro
posal Â¦ was '. made by the other powers that a
combined fleet be assembled \ in , the Chinese
waters : as a, moral 'demonstration, under cover
of which, to .'exact â¢Â¦ of the Chinese Government
respect for foreign treaty, rights and the sup
pression of the Boxers. ,
_, The'Unlted States, ; while not participating in
the Joint .demonstration, promptly sent from
the Philippines' all. ships that could be spared
for service .on the '" Chinese . coast. A ' small
force of marines was. landed at Taku and sent
to 'Peking for "the ' protection' of the American
legation.. Otherpowers took similar action,'

. In this conclusion, which I had the gratifica
tion to announce as . a completed . engagement
to. the interested powers en March 20. I960.' I
hopefully discerned, a potential factor .for , the
abatement of the distrust. of foreign ' purposes
which, for a year past, had appeared to; In

and for the. effective exertion by it of Â¦ power
and authority to quell the critical and fcreijin
movement In the northern 'provinces most lrni
mediately Influenced by the Manchu sentiment.
With gratifying unanimity. the responses co
incided In thlÂ» common policy, enabling me to'
see In the successful termination of these ne
gotiations proof of the friendly spirit. which
animates the. various powers interested in â¢ the
untrammeled development , of commerce and
Industry In the Chinese empire as a source of
vast benefit to , the whole commercial _ world.
The increasing gravity, of the conditions la
China and the Imminence of peril, to our o'wri
diversified Interests in '.he empire, .as well 'as
to those of all. the other treaty ' powers, ' were
soon appreciated by this Government, . cau.Â«

from the earliest days of foreign Intercourse
with China had followed a policy, of pea:*,'
omitting no occasions to testify gobd-will, ; to
further the extension of lawful tn-de,"^ to 're 1

Mindful of this, lt was felt to be approprlata
that our purposes should be pronounced ' In
favor of such course as would hasten action
of thÂ« powers at Peking to promote the admin
istrative reforms so greatly needed for
strengthening the Imperial Government and
maintaining the Integrity of China, In which
we believe the whole Western "world to be alike
concerned. To the,se ends I caused to be ml

WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN PREPARING THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE WHICH Â¦ HE "SUBMITTED YES
TERDAY TO THE SHORT SESSION OF THE FIFTY-SIXTH CONGRESS. :'*-./. tjTV .-
The general bases of negotiations formulated
by the Government of the French republic have
'been accepted with certain reservations as to
details made necessary by our own circum
stances but. like similar reservations by other
power* ' open to discussion in the progress of
the negotiations. The disposition of the Em
perbr's government to admit liability for
wrongs done to foreign governments and their
reDresentatlves, and to act upon such additional
designation of the guilty persons as the for
eien Ministers at Peking may be in a position
to make, gives hope or a complete settlement
of alt questions involved, assuring foreign
rlehts of residence ! and Intercourse on terms
of equality for all the world.

ured â¢ in money alone, a sufficient reparation
Iv wove to be beyond the ability of China

disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement
through the dismemberment of the empire. I
" disposed, to think that .due compensation
v tH, made in part by increased guarantees
t securities for foreign rights and immuni
ties and. : most Important of all, , by the open
ing of China to the equal commerce of all the
world These , views have ; been and will be
earnestly advocated by our representatives.

. â¢ Â¦ - "*"'-Â¦ Â¦"â¢'*Â¦*â¢Â¦ ' ' â¢Â¦ . - -N-
BASES OF NEGOTIATIONS.
â¢â¢I trust 'that negotiations may begin as
soon as we and the other offended governments
shall be effectively satisfied of your Majesty's
ability and power to treat with Just sternness
the principal offenders, who are doubly cul
pable not alone toward the foreigners but
toward your Majesty, under whose rule the
purpose of China to dwell in concord with the
world had j hUherto found expression In the
welcome and protection assured to strangers."
Taking as a point of departure the imperial
edict appointing Earl Lt Hung Chang and
Prince Chlng plenipotentiaries to arrange . a
settlement, and the edict Â¦Â¦ of September 25.
whereby certain high offlflals were designated
for punishment, this Government has moved.
In concert with the other powers, toward the
opening of negotiations, which Mr. Conger,
assisted by Mr. Rockhlll, has been authorized
to conduct on behalf of the United States.
As was then said, "the policy of the Govern
ment of the United States is to seek a solution
which may bring about permanent safety and
peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and
administrative entity, protect all rights guaran
teed to friendly powers by treaty and Interna
tional law and safeguard for the world the
principle of the equal and impartial trade with
all parts of the Chinese empire."
Faithful to those professions, which, as lt
proved, reflected the views and purposes of the
other co-operating governments, all our efforts
have been directed toward ending the anoma
lous situation in China by negotiations for a
settlement at the earliest possible moment. As
soon as the sacred duty of relieving our lega
tion and its dependents was accomplished we
withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our
legation under an adequate guard In Peking "as
a channel of negotiation and settlementâ a
course adopted by others of the interested pow
ers. Overtures of the empowered representa
tives of the Chinese Emperor have been consid
erately entertained.
The Russian proposition looking to the resto
ration of the Imperial power in Peking has been
accepted as in full consonance with our own
desires, for we have held and hold that 'effective
ieparatlon for wrongs suffered and an endur
ing settlement that will make their recurrence
Impossible can best be brought about under an
authority which the Chinese nation reverences
and obeys. While so doing we forego no jot of
our undoubted right to exact exemplary and
deterrent punishment of the responsible authors
and abettors of the criminal "acts, whereby we
and other nations have suffered grievous in-
Jury.
For the real culpritsâ the evil counselors
who have misled the Imperial Judgment and
diverted the sovereign authority to their own
guilty endsâ full expiation becomes Imperative
within the rational limits of retributive Jus
tice. Regarding this as the Initial condition
of an acceptable settlement between China and
the powers. I said In my message of October
18 to the Chinese Emperor:
of American life and property in China and
preventing a thread "of " the disorders or their
recurrence. .

â¢ Two thousand native converts were assembled,
on a near-by place under protection of the for
eigners. Lines of defense were strengthened,
trenches dug, barricades raised Â¦ and prepara
tions made to stand a siege, which at once
began.
Â¦'â¢From June 20 until July 18," writes Mr.
I Conger, "there was scarcely an hour during
("which there was not firing upon some part of
our lines and into seme of the legations, vary
ing from a single shot to a general and con
tinuous attack along- ths whole line." Artil
lery wai placed around the legations and on
the overlooking palace walls, and thousands of
tLrce-inch shot and shell were, fired, destroy
ing some buildings and damaging all. So
thickly did the balls rain that when the am
munition of the besieged ran low five quarts
of Chinese bullets were gathered in an hour
in one compound and recast.
Attempts were made to burn the legations by
st-ttir.g neighboring houses on fire, but the
fl.'imÂ»s were successfully fought off, although
thr Austrian. Belgian. Italian and Dutch le
legatlons were subsequently burned. With the
aid of the native converts, directed, by the
mlfsionaries, to whose helpful co-operation Mr.
Conger awards unstinted praise, the British
legation was made a veritable fortress. ,. The
British Minister. Sir Claude Macdonald. â¢ was
clicsen general commander of the defense, with
the secretary of the American Legation, E. J.
Sfjulres, as chief of staff.
To save life and ammunition the besieged
srarlr.sly returned the incessant fire of the
Chinere soldiery, fighting only to repel attack
or make an occasional successful sortie for
strategic advantage, such as that of fifty-five
Americans, British and Russian marines, led
by Captain Myers of the United States Marine
Corps, which resulted in the capture of a for
midable barricade" on the wall that gravely
rmr.hced the American position. It was held
to the last and proved an Invaluable a;quisl

Indeed, the only communication had with the

Even in the distant provinces, men suspected
*>f roreign sympathy were put to death, promi
nent among these being Chang Yen Hoon, for
merly Chinese Minister in Washington.
â¢ Wlfh Â»he negotiation of the partial armistice
of July 14, a proceeding which was doubtless
promoted by the representations of the Chinese
envoy in Washington, the way was opened |or
the conveyance to Mr. Conger of a test message
sent by the Secretary of State through the kind
offices of Minister Wu Ting Fang. Mr. Con
ger's reply, dispatched from. Peking on July
1C through the same channel, afforded to the
outside world the- first tidings that the Inmates
of the legations were still alive and hoping: for
succor.
This news stimulated the preparations for a
Joint relief expedition in numbers sufficient to
overcome the resistance which for a month had
been organizing between Taku and the capital.
Reinforcements sent by all the co-operating
governments were constantly arriving. The
United States contingent, hastily assembled
from the Philippines or dispatched from this
i country, amounted to some Â£000 men. under the
able command first of the lamented Lieutenant
Colonel Llscum and afterward of General
Chaffce.
. Toward the end of July the movement began.
A severe conflict followed at Tientsin, in which
Colonel Llscum was killed. The city was
stormed and partly destroyed. Its capture
afforded the base of operations from which to
make the final advance, which began In the
first days of August, the expedition being made
up of Japanese, Russian, British and American
troops at the outset.
â¢ Another battle was fought and won at Yang
tsun. Thereafter . the disheartened Chinese
troops offered little show of resistance. A few
days later the Important position of Ho Si Woo
was taken. A rapid march brought the united
forces to the populous city of Tungchau, which
capitulated without a. contest.
FOREIGNERS FINALLY RESCUED
On August 14 the capital was reached. After
a brief conflict .beneath the walls the relief
j column entered and the legations were saved.
The United soldiers, sailors and marines, on
cers and men alike in those distant climes and
unusual surroundings, showed the same valor,
discipline and good conduct and gave proof
of the same high degree of Intelligence and
efficiency which : have distinguished them In
every emergency.
' Â¦ The imperial family and the Government had
fled a few days before. The city was without
visible control. The .remaining Imperial sol
diery had made on the night of the 13th a last
attempt to exterminate' the besieged, which was
gallantly, repelled. â¢ It fell to the occupying
forces to restore order and organize a provi
sional administration.
Â¦ Happily, the acute disturbances were confined
to the northern provinces. It Is a relief to
recall and a pleasure to record the loyal con
duct of the Viceroys and local authorities of
the southern ar.a eastern provinces. Their ef
forts were continuously directed to the pacific
control of the vast populations under their
rule and to the scrupulous observance of for
eign treaty rights.' At critical moments they
did not . hesitate to memorialize the throne,
urging the protection of the legations, the res
toration of communication and the assertion
of the imperial authority against the subver
sive element*. They maintained excellent rela
tions with the. official representatives of for
eign powers. To their- kindly disposition la
largely due the success of the Consuls in re
moving many of the missionaries from the In
terior to places of safety. In this relation the
action of the Consuls' should be highly com
mended. In Shantung j and Eastern Chill the
task was difficult, but, thanks to their energy
and the co-operation of American and foreign
naval commanders, hundreds of foreigners, in
cluding those of other nationalities than ours,
were rescued from imminent' peril.
. THE POLICY OF AMERICA.
The policy of the United States through all
this trying period; was clearly announced and
scrupulously carried out. A circular, note to the
powers, dated JulyJ 3. proclaimed our attitude,
treating the condition - In the north j as one of
virtual anarchy, ; In which the great provinces
of the south and : southeast had no share. We
regarded the local ; authorities in; the- latter
quarters as representing ' the .'- Chinese , people,
with whom we : sought , to remain In peace and
friendship. .Our declared alms Involved no war

By the terms of the treaty of peace the line

AT PEACE WITH SPAIN.
Satisfactory progress has been made toward
the conclusion of a .general treaty, of friend
ship and Intercourse with Spain In replacement
of the old treaty, which passed Into abeyance
by reason of the late. war. A new convention
of extradition Is approaching completion and I
should be much pleased were a commercial ar
rangement to follow. I feel that woshould not
suffer to pass an opportunity to reaffirm the
cordial ties that existed between us and Spain
from the time of our .earliest Independence,
and to enhance the mutual benefits of that
commercial .Intercourse which is natural be
tween the two countries.

to acromplifh this which were Introduced In
' the (Senate and Hou?e. It is Incumbent upon us
. to remedy the statutory omission which has led.
and may lead again, to such untoward results.
I have pointed out the necessity and the prece
dent for legislation of this character. Its. enact
ment is a simple measure of previsory Justice
toward the nations with which we as a sover
eign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal
observance.
While the Italian Government naturally re
rsrds such action as the primary and. indeed,
the most ersentUl element in the disposal of
the Tatlulah incident. I advise that, in accord
ance with precedent, and in view of the im
r-rcbal>ility of that particular case being
rer.ehed by the bill now pending. Congress
n:eke gracious provision for indemnity to the
Italian eufferers in the same form and propor
tion as heretofore. In my inaugural address I
nierred to the general subject of lynching tn
tLcse words:
"Lynching must not be tolerated in a great
and civilized country like the United States;
a i;rts. not mobs, must execute the penalties of
the law. The preservation of public order, the
right of discussion, the integrity of courts, and.
the orderly administration, of justice must con
tinue forever the rock of safety upon which
cur Government securely rests."
This I must urgently reiterate and again in
vite the attention of my countrymen to this re
rtoach upon our civilization.
DEVELOPMENT OF JAPAN.
The closing year has witnessed a decided
strengthening of Japan's relations to other
states. The development of her independent
Judicial and administrative functions und-r the
treaties which took effect July 17, 1$99, has pro
ceeded without international friction, showing
the competence of the Japanese to hold a fore
most place among the modern peoples.
In the treatment of the difficult Chinese
problem, Japan has acted In harmonious i.on
ctrt with the other powers, and her generous
cr -operation materially aided In the Joint re
lief of the beleaguered legations in Peking and
in bringing about an understanding prelimin
ary to a settlement of the issues between the
powers and China. Japan's ' declarations In
favor of the Integrity of the Chinese empire
and the conservation of open-world trade there
with have been frank and positive. As a factor
for promoting the general intercuts of peace,
crder and fair commerce in the far East, the
influence of Japan can hardly be overestimated.
The valuable aid and kindly courtesies extend
ed by the Japanese Government and naval offi
cers to the battleship Oregon are gratefully
appreciated.
Complaint was made last summer of the dis
criminatory enforcement of. a bubonic quaran
tine against Japanese on the Pacific Coast and
of Interference with their travel in. California
,and Colorado under the health laws of those
'states. The latter restrictions have been ad
judged by a Federal court to be unconstitution

HAGUE TREATY RATIFICATION.
It Is with satisfaction that I am able u, an
r.cunce the formal notification at The Hague,
on September 4. of the depoclt of ratifications
of the convention for the pacific settlement of
thf international disputes by sixteen powers,
namely, the United State*. Austria, Belgium,
I>nmark. England. France, Germany, Italy,
IVnrta. Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Stam,
Pi-n'n, Sweden and Norway, and The Nether

The administrative council of the permanent
COUtt of arbitration has been organized and has
adapted rules of order and a constitution for
the International arbitration bureau. In ac
cordance with- Article XXIII of the convention,
piovidlng for the appointment by each signa
tory power of persons of, known competency in
q'lertlons of international . law as arbitrators,
I have appointed as members ' of this court,
Hon. Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, ex-Presl

States: Hon. John W. Grins of New Jersey,
Attorney-General of the' United States, and

As an incident of the brief revolution tn the
Mosquito District of Nicaragua, early in 1899,
the Insurgents forcibly collected from Ameri

restoration of order the Nlcaraeuan authorities
demanded a second payment of such duties on
the ground that they were due to the titular
Government, and that their diversion had aided
the revolt. , . , Â¦ .'

an effective , code of State legislation as to
make a complete system of laws throughout
the United States adequate to compel a gen
eral observance of the. salutary rules to which
I have referred." ' _: . :
The whole question Is'so Important and far
reachlng that I am sure no part of It will be
In my latt annual message to Congress I
called attention to the necessity for early ac
tion to remedy such evils as might be found
to exist In connection with combinations of
capital organized Into trusts and again invite
attention to my discussion of the subject at
that time, which concluded with th?se words:
COMBINATIONS AND TRUSTS.
The attention of Congress Is invited to the
recommendation of tlw Secretary of the Treas
ury In his annual report for legislation In
behalf of the revenue cutter service and favor
able action is urged.
I recommend that the Congress at Its pres
ent session reduce the Internal revenue taxes
Imposed to meet the expenses of the war with
Spain in the ouirt of *30.0no,000. This reduction
should be secured by the remission of those
taxes which expedience has shown to.be the
most burdensome to the industries of the peo-
P I especially urge that . there be Included In
whatever reduction Is made the legacy tax on
bequests for public uses of a literary, educa
tional or charitable character.
American vessels during the past three years
have carried about 9 per cent of our exports
and Imports. Foreign shipa should carry the
least not the greatest part of American trade.
The remarkable growth of our, steel Indus
tries, the progress of shipbuilding for the do
mestic trade and our steadily maintained ex
penditures for the navy have created an oppor
tunity to place the United States in the first
rank of commercial maritime powers.
Besides realizing a proper national aspiration,
this will mean the establishment and healthy
growth along all our coasts of a distinctive na
tional industry, expanding the field for profit
able employment of labor and capital. It will
increase the transporatlon facilities and reduce
freight charges on the vast volume of products
brought from the Interior to the seaboard for
export, and will strengthen an arm of the na
tional defense upon which the founders of the
Government and their successors have relied.
In again urging Immediate action by Con
gress on measures to promote American ship
ping and fn-elgn trade. I direct attention to
the recommendations on the subject In pre
vious messages, ,and particularly to the opinion
expressed in the message of 1899:,
"I am satisfied the Judgment of the country
favors the policy of aid to our merchant ma
rine, which will broaden our commerce and
markets and upbuild our Bea->carryln* capacity
for the products of agriculture and manufac
ture, which, with the increase of. our navy,
mean more work and wages j to our country
men as well as a safeguard to American Inter
ests In every part of the word."
The Imports for the year amounted to $Â«43.
941.1S4, an Increase over 1899 of $152,792,633. This
Increase is largely In materials for manufac
ture, and Is In response to the rapid develop
ment of manufacturing in the United States.
While there was imported for use in manufac
tures In 1900 material to the value of $79,768,973
in excess of 1S89, It is reassuring to observe
that there is a tendency toward decrease in the
importation of articles manufactured ready
for consumption, winch in 1900 formed 15.17
per cent of the total Imports, asalnst 15.54 per
cent in 1S99, and 21.G9 per cent in 1S96. .
Agricultural products were also exported dur
ing 1900 in greater volume than In 1953. the total
for the year being $835,858,123, against $784,776,
142 in 1S99.
Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record
of commercial . and Industrial progress. The
total of Imports and exports for the first' tlm<?
in the history of our country exceeded two
billions of dollars. The exports are greater

the fiscal year 1900 being $1,394,483,082, an In

greater than 1836 by $311,876,144.
The growth of manufactures In the United

manufactured products largely exceed those of
any previous year, their value for 1900 being

A large Increase in national bank circula
tion haa resulted from the provisions of the
act which permits national banks to Issue cir
culating notes to the par value of the United

increase In circulating notes from March 14 to

The 'important matter of an interoceanic
canal has assumed a new phase. Adhering to Its
lefusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture
of the contract of the Maritime Canal Com
pany, which was terminated for alleged non
execution in October, 1>>99, the Government ot
Nicaragua has since supplemented that ac
tion by- declaring the so-Ptyled Eyre-Cragin
option void for .nan-payment of the stipulated
; advance. Protests In relation to these act?
j have been filed In the State Department and
are under consideration. Deeming Itself re
lieved from existing engagements, the Nicara
guan Government shows a disposition to deal
freely with the canal question either in the
way of negotiations with the United States or
by taking measures to promote the waterway.
Overtures for a convention to effect the
i building of a canal under the auspices of the
j United States are under consideration. In the
Â¦ meantime the views of Congress upon the sub
! Ject. in the light of the report of the committee
appointed to examine the comparative merits of
the various trans-lsthmlan ship canal projecta,
may be awaited.
I commend to the early attention of the Sen.
ate the convention with Great Britain to facili
tate the Â¦ construction of such a canal and to
i remove any objection which might arise out of
j the convention commonly called the Clayton
j Bulwer treaty.

San Juan del Norte. In trust until the two
Governments should determine whether the first
payments had been made under compulsion to
a "de facto" authority. Agreement as to this
was not reached, and the point was waived by
the act of the Nicaraguan Government In re
questing the British Consul to return the de
pesits to the merchants.
Menacing differences between several of the
Central American States have been accommo
dated, our Ministers rendering good offices
towcrd an understanding.
Progress In the hoped-for direction has been
favorable. Our forces have successfully con
trolled the greater part of the islands, over
coming the organized forces of the insurgents
and carrying order and administrative regu
larity to all quarters. What opposition remains
Is for the moot part scattered, obeying no con
certed plan of strategic action, operating only
by the methods common to the traditions of
guerrilla warfare, which, while ineffective to
alter the general control now established, are
In my last annual message I dwelt at soxna
length upon the condition of affairs la the
Philippine*. While seeking to Impress upon
you that the grave responsibility of the future
government of those islands rests with thÂ«
Congress of the United States, I abstained
from recommending at that time a specific and
final form of government for the territory
actually held by the United States forces and
in which as Ions as Insurrection continues the
military arm must necessarily be supremo. I
stated my purpose, until Congress ' Â¦hall have
made known the formal expression of ita will,
to use the authority Tested in me by the con
stitution and the statutes to uphold tbÂ« Sov
ereignty of the United States in these dis
tant islands as in all other places where our
flatr rightfully floats, placing, to that end, at
the disposal of the army and navy all the
means which the liberality of Congress and
the people have provided. No contrary expres
sion of the â¢will of -Congress having been made
I- have stead f astir pursued the purpose ao de
clared, employing the civil arm as well toward
the accomplishment of pacification and. the In
stitution of local governments within the linn
of authority and law.

hav* the studied deliberation of Congress, re
sulting in wise and judicious action.
It is -worthy of . mention that . the greater
number of. banks being organized under the
new law are In; sections where the need of
banking facilities has been most . pronounced.
Iowa > stands first . with '.. thirty banks of . the
smaller class, while Texas, â¢ Oklahoma, Indian
Territory .and the Middle Western' sections of
the country havÂ» also availed â¢ themselves
largely of. the. privileges under, the new law.
ORGANIZATION OF BANKS.
Another effect of the operation, as stated by
the Secretary, is to reduce the charge upon
the . treasury for the payment of interest from
the dates of refunding to February 1, 1901, by
the sum of more than $7,000,000 annually.
From February 1. 1904, to July 1, 1907, the an
nual Interest charge will be reduced by the
sum of more'than $5.00*. 000. and for ihe thir
teen months ending August 1. 1908, by about
$1,000,000. The full details of the refunding
are given in the annual! report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury.
The . beneficial effect of the financial act of
1900. as far as it relates to the modification of
the national banking act, is already apparent.
The provisions for the Incorporation of national
banks with a capltalof not less than $25,000 in
places not exceeding 3000 Inhabitants has re
sulted [ in the extension of banking facilities
to many small . communities, hltljerto unable
to provide j themselves with banking Institu
tions under 'the national system. There were
organised from the enactment of the law up
to and Including November 30..3S9 national
banks, of which 26Â« were with capital leea than
$50,000. and 103 with capital of .$50,000 or
more. _ â¢ . |
The law of March 14, 1900, provides for re
funding into 2 per. cent thirty-year bonds,
payable, principal and ' interest,' In gold coin
of the present standard value, that portion of
the public debt represented by the '3 per cent
bonds of 1908, the 4 per cents of 1907 and the
5 per cents of 1904, of which there were out
standing at the date of said law $839,149,930.
The hojders of . the old bonds presented them
for exchange between March 14 and November
30 to the amount of $361,943,750. The net saving
to the Government on these transactions ag
gregates $9,106,166.
It will be the duty, as I am sure It will bÂ«
thÂ« disposition, of the Congress to provide
whatever further legislation is needed to In
sure the continued parity, under all conditions,
between our two forms of metallic money, sil
ver and gold. .
Our surplus revenues have permitted the
SecretaryNof the Treasury slnee the close of
the fiscal year to call In the funded loan of
1891, continued at 2 per cent. In the sum of
$25,361,800. To and including November 30,
$23,458,100 of these bonds have been paid. This
sum, together with the amount Â¦ ' which may
accrue from further redemptions under the
call, will be applied to the sinking fund.
and bullion, held for the redemption of United
Slates notes. If this form were, pursued, the
cush balance, including the present gold re
serve of $150,000,000. would be $289,303. 794 50.
Such balance November 30, 1899, was $396,495,
301 5T>. In the general fund, which Is wholly
separate from the reserve and trust funds, there
was on November 30. $70,090,073 15 in gold coin
and bullion, to which should be added $22,957,
300 In gold certificates subject to issue, against
v/hlch there Is held in the division of redemp
tion gold coin and bullion, making a total hold-
Ing of free gold amounting to $33,047,373 15.
Because of the excess of revenues over expen
ditures, the Secretary of the Treasury was en
abled to apply bonds and other securities to the
sinking fund to the amount of $56,544,556 06.
The details of the sinking fund are set forth
l.i the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
to which I Invite attention. The Secretary of
the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the
current fiscal year will aggregate $380,000,000,
and the expenditures $000,000,000, leaving an ex
cess of revenues over expenditures of $SO,000,000.
The present condition of the treasury Is one
of undoubted strength. The available cash bal
ance November 30 was $139,303,794 50. Under the
form of statement prior to the financial law of
March 14 last, this would have been included
In the statement of available cash, gold coin
It Is gratifying .also to note that during the
year a considerable reduction is shown In the
expenditures of the Government. The "War De
partment expenditures for the fiscal year 1900
were $134,774,767 78, a reduction of $93,06G,4SÂ« 69
over those of 1S99. In the Navy Department the
expenditures were $55,953,077 72 for the year 1900.
as against $63,942,104 25 for the preceding year,
a decrease of $7,983,026 53. In the expenditures
on account of Indians there was a decrease In
1900 over 1899 of $2,630,604 3S; and In the civil and
miscellaneous expenses for 1900 there was a
reduction Of $13,418,065 74. '-. i Â¦â¢-.-Â¦"-

The practical utility of the "consular service
In obtaining a wide range of information aa to
the Industries and commerce of other countries
and the opportunities thereby afforded for in
troducing the sale of our goods have kept
steadily in advance of the notable expansion ol
our foreign trade, and abundant evidence has
tx-en furnished, both at home and abroad, of
the fact that the consular reports. Including
meny from our diplomatic representatives, have
to a considerable extent pointed out ways and
means of disposing of a great variety of manu
factured goods which otherwise might not have
found sale abroad.
Testimony of foreign observer* to the com
mercial efficiency of the consular corps seema
to be conclusive, and our own manufacturers
and exporters highly appreciate the value of
the services rendered, not only In the printed
reports, but also l In the individual efforts of
consular officers to promote American trade.
An increasing part of (he work of the Bureau
ot Foreign Commerce, j whose primary duty it
is. to compile and print the reports, is to an
swer inquiries : : from trade organizations, Lusl
ness houses, etc., as to conditions in various
parts of the world, : and, notwithstanding the
sniallness of the force employed,, the, work has
been so systematized that responses are made
with such promptitude and accuracy a* to elicit
lettering encomiums. .; The experiment of print-
Ing the consular reports dally for immediate
use! by trade bodies, exporters and the press,
which was begun in January, 1898/ continues to
givegeneral satisfaction. . .
UTILITY OF CONSULS.
The bureau of the American Republics contin
ues to discharge, with the happiest results, the
important work of promoting the cordial rela
tions between the United States and the Latin-
American countries, all of which are now act
ive- members of the International union. The
bureau has been instrumental in bringing about
the agreement for another international Ameri
can congress, which is to meet In the City oi
Mexico in October, 1901. The bureau's futurt
for another term of ten years Is assured by thÂ«
International compact, but the congress will
doubtless have much to do with shaping new
Hr.es of work and ft general policy. Its use
fulness to the Interests of Latin- American trade
Is widely appreciated and shows gratifying de
velopment. â¢
The exposition of the resources and products
of the Western hemisphere to be held at Buf
falo next year promises Important results, not
only for the United , States, but for the other
participating countries. It In gratifying that
the Latin-American States have evinced the
liveliest Interest, and the fact that an interna
tional American congress will be held in the
City of Mexico while the exposition Is in pro
gress encourages the hope of a larger display
at Buffalo than might otherwise be practicable.
The work of preparing an exhibit of our na
tional resources Is making satisfactory pro
gress under the direction of different officials
of the Federal Government, and the various
Etntes of the Union have shown a disposition
toward the most liberal participation in the
enterprise.
This Government deslrts to preserve the most
Just and amicable commercial relations with
all foreign countries, unmoved by the Industrial
rivalries necessarily developed In the expan
sion of international trade. It Is believed that
the foreign Governments generally entertain
the same purpose, though in some Instances
there are clamorous demands upon them for
legislation specifically hostile to American ln
t< tests. Should those demands prevail. I shall
communicate with the Congress with the view
of advising such legislation as may be neces
sary to meet the emergency.
The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests
upon the principles of International equity and
has been so repeatedly approved by the people
of the United State*, that there ought to be no
hesitation In either branch of the Congress In
giving to it full effect.
The failure of action by the Senate at its last
session upon the commercial conventions then
submitted for its consideration and approval,
although caused by the great pressure of other
legislative business, has caused much disap
pointment to the agricultural and industrial
interests of the country, which hoped to profit
by their provisions. The conventional periods
for their ratification having expired, it became
necessary to sign additional articles extend
ing the time for that purexjse. This was re
quested on our part, and the other Governments
Interested have concurred, with, the exception,
of one convention, in * respect to . which no
formal reply has been received.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS.
Slnee my : . last communication to Congress
on this subject special commercial agreements
under the third section of the. tariff act have
been proclaimed with Portugal, with Italy and
with Germany. Commercial conventions under
the general limitations of the fourth section
of the same act have been concluded with Nic
aragua, with Ecuador, with tfie Dominican Re
public, with Great Britain on behalf of tlvi
island of Trinidad, and with Denmark on o*
half of the island of St. Croix. These will be
early communicated to the Senate. Negotia
tions with other governments are In progress
for the improvement and security of our com
mercial relations.
Our claims upon the Government of the Sul
tan for reparation for injuries suffered by
American citizens in Armenia and elsewher"
Rive promise of early and satisfactory settle
ment. His Majesty's good disposition in this
regard has been evinced by the Issuance of an
irade for rebuilding: the American college at
Harpoot.

Representative Loud said:
"I always think it idle to discuss a
President's message until it has been
carefully read and thoroughly digested. I
have not yet had time to do so, but from
a casual examination of it will say it
appears to be a thoroughly business-like
document throughout. Just euch as we
would expect from the President. As for
bills pending In Congress will say I have
no means of knowing whether the canal
bill or ship subsidy bill will be passed at
this session. I know that at the very
first opportunity Senator Frye. chairman
of the Committee on Commerce, will at
tempt to sidetrack the canal bill by call
ing up the ship subsidy bill. I have va
rious measures to propose for California
improvements, but as my bills are not yet
perfected, I cannot, discuss them, at this
time."

I'll succeed. We want relief for the own

work of building storage reservoirs as

I think we will work and avoid necessity
for an extra session."
full and complete report Is made by that
commission and the United States Su
preme Court has determined the questions
now pending before it in regard to our
new possessions, it would be, to say the
least, unwise to legislate concerning theso
Islands. The President's message is a calm
and dispassionate review of the finan
cial. Industrial and commercial condition*
of this country and of our relations with
foreign countries. His recommendation
for the construction of a cable between
the United States and Hawaii, with ex
tension to Manila, will receive the hearty
indorsement of all Californians."
KAHN PREDICTS RESULTS.
Representative Kahn said:
"Judging from the sentiments uttered
by members of the House in the cloak
rooms and lobbies to-day the present
short session of Congress will be one of
unusual activity. Of course, the regular
appropriation bills will consume the
usual amount of time, but there are,
several questions of national importance.
In which the Pacific Coast States are
deeply interested, that will come up for
early consideration. I was pleased to see
that the President in his message so
strongly advocates the construction of
the trans-Pacific cable. No doubt that
will have considerable influence in secur
ing the passage of the Senate bill, which
is now on the calendar and which will
undoubtedly be called up for early con
sideration. The Nicaragua canal bill
will engage the attention of the Seaate
next Monday, and the general impression
seems to be that the House bill, with cer
tain modifications, will pass the upper
house. The army reorganization bill will
be one. of the most Important measures
considered, and will no doubt precipitate
a rancorous debate. The apportionment
bill is also going to provoke a struggle.
but from present indications the number ?
of members will not be materially in
creased. The oleomargarine bill is the
special order for Wednesday of this week.
Much feeling has been engendered In the
discussion of this measure, and no donbt
the debate will provoke more or loss bit
terness. Even shouloV this measure pass
the House, It is doubtful whether it will
obtain consideration In the Senate at this
session. Then, of course, the bill for the
reduction of the war tax is going to be
a most important piece of legislation. Tho
entire country seems to demand that tho
tax be reduced, if not absolutely repealed,
and should the committee report a bill
exempting certain products ' or articles,
documents or industries from the tax
those not so favored will make a vigorous
fight to get the advantage of the pro
posed reduction. Altogether, the session
promises to be most exciting, and many
bills of purely local or private character
will receive but scant recognition."
WOODS IS HOPEFUL.
Representative Woods said:
"The message oi President McKinley
v/as in keeping with his. late letter accept
ing the nomination for the Presidency. It
completely covered the great questions to
come before Congress, was terse and de
cisive, and such ns only a man of the
largest understanding of America's posi
tion at home and abroad and a statesman
could have written. My first thought upon
bearing It was that the American petjple
should thank God that the election went
as it did. There is a great deal to come '
before Congress at the present short ses
sion, but I believe it will be able to carry
everything through in a satisfactory man
ner, as I do not look for dilatory tactics
on the part of the minority. I believe that
one of the measures passed will be a Nic
aragua canal bill which will meet with the
approval not only of the Pacific Coast,
but of the whole United States. I made
my campaign upon a personal belief in
the widest possible expansion of American
liberty and institutions/ and still adher"
to this belief. I shall heartily favor Sena
tor Frye's ship subsidy bill, the Nicaragua
canal bill, and all of the recommendations
contained in the President's message. An
other thing which I heartily favor is a
reduction of the war revenue tax to the
smallest limit cpnsistent with our finan
cial welfare. I shall persistently urge an
appropriation of $300,C00 for the betterment
of the Yuba river and its tributaries, to
supplement the $5000 now unexpended in
tho hands of the California Debris Com
mission. I am a believer in a great Indus
trial and commercial future for CaJifornia
and in forwarding this the navigability of
her interior waters is very important."
WHAT NEEDHAM DESIRES.
Representative Needham stated that he
had not as yet had time to carefully read
the President's message, but from the
slight examination he had been able to
give it, regarded it as a strong documen..,
especially the portions dealing with th-?
administration's course irf China. He sa'd
he believed that the canal bill, the Pacific
cable bill and an army reorganization bill
and a bill reducing the taxes levied in the
Avar revenue act would pass this session.
A reapportlonment basis would be fixed
and strong efforts would be put forth to
pass the ship subsidy bill with good pros
pects of success. "In regard to measures
that particularly interest my district." he
said. "I shall use my best efforts to get
an adequate appropriation to improve San
Diego harbor and 1 believe I'll succeed.
If I don't get a lump sum I feel confident
that this harbcr will be put under the
continuing contract. I want to get a pub
lic building at Fresno and if a public

1S.420. The President shows that for
economical domestic purposes there
must be an increase in the army,
and recommends that Its perma
nent force be placed at 60,000, with
power . to Increase it to- 100.000- during
the present conditions in Cuba and the
Philippines, including 15,000 native troops
in the latter islands. In my opinion, V.\<i
President has placed this important ques
tion in. a very strong light. The policy of
the administration in respect to the Phil
ippines is clearly set forth in hi3 instruc
tions to the Taft Commission, and In
them there can be found no fact on which
to base a claim of danger from Imperial
ism."
METCALF SPEAKS PLAINLY.
Representative Metcalf said:
"It is impossible a*, this early date to
state just what measures will receive the
attention of Congress at this session, it
is safe to say. however, that the general
appropriation bills will receive immediate
attention, and will take precedence over
all other measures. A particularly strong
effort will be made to secure the passage
of a shipping bill to the end that Ameri
can merchandise and croducts may be
carried in American bottoms. The Nic.t
ragua canal bill Is now before the Senate,
and a strong effort wiil be made to secure
its passage. The war revenue act will
Vie amended, reducing the revenue derived
under that act at least $30,000Â»000 a year.
A bill will be Introduced and passed re
organizing and Increasing the military
force of the United States. A river and
harbor bill will also be passed at this
session. There will, in my opinion, be no
legislation at this, session affectlnir the
Philippine Islands. The Taft Commission
as yet has made no report, and until a
America. To abropate the treaty might
remove the prohibition in England, while
to confirm*? it will be to tie our own hands
forever on a matter which may eventu
ally become of vital importance. This is
a question which ought to be cleared up
before any irrevocable decision is made
either to confirm or to endeavor honor
ably to abrogate thÂ§ Clayton-Bulwer
treaty."
SENATOR PERKINS' VIEWS.
Senator Perkins said:
"I think the President's message an ex
cellent resume of the business conditions
Â«if the country, foreign and domestic, and
it sets forth in moM simple and convincing
manner the flourishing state of our Indus
tries from the growth of raw materials
to the manufacture of finished products.
These portion of the message show up
very dearly and in businesslike form the
remarkable prosperity of the Unite!
States at present. It will be notice! the
President di cs not refer with very great
strei:pth to the Nicaragua canal. But this
I attribute to the fact that the ITay-
Paunoefote treaty, which has important
provisions relative to such canal, has not
been acted on by the Serrate. The Pres
ident indorses the ship subsidy bill as tho
only way to rehabilitate our merchant
marine. In this I heartily concur, and
find only one caiyse for criticism of the
bill, which is that it admits foreign -built
ships. My desire is that all vessels flyns
the American flag be constructed here,
fnless the Democrats should offer strenu
ous obstruction. I thinU that the bill wlil
become law. with perhaps a few amend
ments. The reference of the President to
t!:t s'tuaticn in which the army now is is
most timely. He shows that under the.
sujministration of President Cleveland, a.
scheme of coast defense fortifications was
devised which involves the outlay of over

In mind . that the government which they are

GOVERNMENT OF ISLANDS.
Continued From Page Two.
Later reports from the commission show yet
more encouraging advices toward insuring tha
benefits of liberty and good government to the
Filipinos, in the Interest --if humanity and with
the aim of building up an enduring, self-sup
porting and self-administering community in
these Far Eastern seas. I would impress upon
the Congress that whatever legislation may
be enacted in respect to the Philippine Islands
should be along these generous lines. The for.
tune of war has thrown upon this nation an"
unsought trust which should be unselfishly dis
charged, and devolved upon this Government
This commission, composed of eminent cit
izens, representing the diverse geographical
and political Interests of the country, ami
bringing to their task the ripe fruits of Ions
and Intelligent service in educational, admin
istrative and judicial careers, made great
progress from the outset. As early as August
21, 1900, it submitted a preliminary report,
which will be laid before the Congress and frcm
which It appears that already the good effects
of returning order are felt; that business In
terrupted by hostilities is improving as peace
extends; that a larger area Is under sugar cul
tivation than ever before; that the customs
revenues are greater than at any time during
the Spanish rule; that economy and efficiency
In the military administration have created a
surplus fund of $6,C00,000. available for needed
public Improvements; that a stringent civil
sen-Ice law Is In preparation; that railroad
communications are expanding, opening up rich
districts, and that a comprehensive scheme of
education Is being organized.
Colncidentally with the entrance of the com
mission upon Its labor. I caused to be issued by
Oeneral MacArthur, the Military Governor of
the Philippines, on June 21, 1500, a'proclama
tion of amnesty in generous terms, of which
many Insurgents took advantage, among them
a number of Important leaders.
PROGRESS IN PHILIPPINES.
God gave victory to American arms at Manila
and set their lands under the sovereignty and
the protection of the people of the United
States.
"Therefore. It Is ordered that a general elec
tion be heid in the island of Cuba on the third
Saturday of September, In the year 19C0, to elect
delegates to a convention to meet in the city
"And whereas, the people of Cuba have estab
lished municipal governments, deriving their
authority from the suffrages of the people
given under Just and equal laws, and are now
ready. In like manner, to proceed to the estab
lishment of a general government which shall
assume and exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction
and control over the islands:
" 'That the United States hereby disclaims
any disposition of Intention to exercise sover
eignty, jurisdiction or control over said island,
except for the pacification thereof, and asserts
lta determination, when that Is accomplished,
to leave the government and control of the
Island to Its people.'
" That the people of the Island of Cuba are
and of right ought to be free and Independent:
I believe that this pledge has been faithfully
kept. As high and' sacred an obligation rests
upon ' the government of the United States to
give protection for property and life, civil and
religious freedom, and wise, firm and unselfish
guidance in the paths of peace and prosperity
to all the people of the Philippine Islands. I
charge this commission ; to â¢Â¦ labor for â¢ the full
performance of this obligation, which concerns
the honor * and ' conscience < of ; this country, In
the flrm'hope that through '-their labors all the
Inhabitants of the Philippine 'Islands may com*
to look back with gratitude to the day when
"This city. Its Inhabitants Its churches, its
religious worship, its educational establish
ments and Its private property of all descrip
tions are placed under the special safeguard
of-the faith and honor of the American army."
All officers and employes of the United
States, both civil and military, should be Im
pressed with a sense of the duty to observe not
merely the material but the personal and so
cial rluhts of the people of the Islands and to
treat them with the same courtesy and respect
for their personal dignity which the people of
the United j States are accustomed to require
from each other."
The articles of capitulation of the city of
Manila on the 13th of August, 1S98, concluded
with these words:
"In dealing with the uncivilized tribes of the
Islands the . commission should adopt the same
course followed by Congress In permitting tho
tribes of our North American Indians to main
tain.their tribal organization and government,
and under which many of those tribes are now
living In peace and contentment, surrounded
by a civilization to which they are unable or
unwilling to conform. Such tribal govern
ments should, however, , be subjected to wise
and firm regulation, and. without undue or
petty Interference, constant and active effort
should be exercised to prevent barbarous prac
tices and Introduce civilized customs.
"The main body of the laws which regulate
the lights and obligations of the people should
be maintained with as little Interference an
possible. Changes made should be mainly In
procedure and in the criminal laws to secure
speedy and Impartial trials and at the same
time effective administration and respect for
individual rights. Â¦ â¢ ..... â¢ i . ,
"It may be well that the many changes
which should be made In the system of taxation
and in the body of the laws under which the
people are governed, except such changes as
have already been made by the military gov
ernment, should be relegated to the civil gov
ernment, which Is to be established under the
auspices of the commission. It will, however,
be the duty of the Commission to Inquire dili
gently as to whether there are- any further
changes which ought not to be delayed, and If
so, they are authorized to make such changes,
subject to your approval. In doing so they are
to bear In mind that taxes which tend to penal
ize or repress industry and enterprise are to be
avoided; that provisions for taxation should be
simple, so that they may be understood by the
people; that they should affect the fewest prac
ticable subjects of taxation which will serve
for the general distribution of the burden.
"It will be the duty of the commission to pro
mote and extend, and, as they find occasion, to
improve the system of education already Inau
gurated by the military authorities. In doing
this they should regard as of first importance
the extension of a system of primary educa
tion, which 6hall be free to all. and which
shall tend to fit the people for the duties ot
citizenship and for the ordinary avocations of
a civilized community. This Instruction should
be given in the first Instance. in every part of
the Islands In the language of the people. In
view of the great number of languages spoken
by the different tribes, it Is especially Impor
tant to the prosperity of the Islands that a com
mon medium of communication may be estab
lished, and It is obviously desirable that this
medium should be the English language. Es
pecial attention should be at once given to
affording full opportunity to all the people of
the islands to acquire the use of the English
language.
Judgment; that if the same public Interests re
quire the extinguishment of property rights
lawfully acquired and held, due compensation
shall be made out of the public treasury there
for; that no form of religion and no minister
of religion shall be forced upon any community
or upon any citizen of the Islands: that, upon
the other hand, no minister of religion shall
be interfered with or molested In following his
calling and that the separation between state
and church shall be real, entire and absolute.
"It Is evident that the most enlightened
thought of the Philippine Islands fully appre
ciates the Importance of these principles and
rules, and they will inevitably within a short
time command universal assent. Upon every
division and branch of the government of the
Philippines, therefore, must be Imposed three
inviolable rules: That no person shall be de
prived of life, liberty or property without due
process of law; that private property shall not
be taken for public use without just,compen
sation; that in all criminal prosecutions the ac
cused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and
public trial, to be Informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation, to be confronted with
the witnesses against him, to have compulsory
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his
defense; that excessive ball shall not be re
quired nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel
flr.d unusual punishment Inflicted; that no per
son shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same
offense, or be compelled In any criminal case
tc be a witness against himself; that the right
to be secure against unreasonable searches and
seizures shall not be violated; that neither
slavery nor Involuntary servitude shall exist,
except as a punishment for crime; that no bill
."At the same time' the commission should
bear In 'mind and the people of the islands
snould be made plainly to understand that there
are certain great principles of government
which have been made the basis of our govern
mental system, which we deem essential to the
rule of law and the maintenance of individual
freedom, and of which they have, unfortunate
ly, been denied the experience possessed by us;
that there are also certain practical rules of
government which we have found to be essen
ttal to the preservation of these great principles
of liberty and law, and that these principles
and these rules of government must be estab
lished aÂ«id maintained In their islands for the
sake of their liberty and happiness, however
much they may conflict with the customs or
laws of procedure with which they are familiar.

veys be made and that thf methods of the dis
position of such lands be prescribed by law.
On the .23th of July, 1900, I directed that a
call be Issued for an election In Cuba for mem
bers of a constitutional convention to frame
a constitution as a basis for a stable and Inde
pendent government In j the Islands. In pur
suance thereof, the military Governor issued
the following Instructions:

PRESIDENT McKINLEY SENDS HIS MESSAGE TO THE FIFTY-SIXTH CONGRESS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-A caucus of
the Democratic members of the House of
Representatives was held in the hall of
the House at the close of the session to
day to consider the course to be taken on
army legislation. Representative Hay of
Virginia, a member of the Military Com
mittee, explained the status of the army

the desirability of not legislating until the

the late Representative Daly of New Jer

Pennsylvania; William Richardson, .who
succeeds General Wheeler of Alabama;
W. H. Jackson, who succeeds Governor
Smith of Maryland, and Samuel D. Woods,
who succeeds Representative De Vrles of
California.
Mr. Bailey of Texas questioned the form
of the resignation of Representative Dol
liver. He said he doubted the right of a
member .to. resign at. a future fixed date.
He said he would not raise the point
formally, but merely called attention to It,
so In future it could not be used as a pre
cedent. '-Â¦
Dolliver'B resignation, he said, had been
tendered to take effect December 1. so that
Mr. Conner had been elected to fill the va
cancy which did not exist at the time of
the election. He cited a court decision to
show that a resignation to take effect at
a future date was not a resignation In
fact, but simply a notification of a resig
nation to be made in the future. Bailey
said he did not desire to press the matter,
but desired the protest to be filed.
The Speaker stated that inasmuch as ob
jection had been made Connor would step
aside until the protest had been disposed

Too plain to be misunderstood Is the at
titude of the Democrats with reference to
the Republican programme. It Is not ex
pected that there will be even a vigorous
opposition to any of the administration's
measure?. Senator Jones, chairman of
the National Democratic Committee, is
apparently disgusted. Extreme Demo
crats of the Bryanite school in both
houses frankly admit that it will be dif
ficult to get the Democrats to line up in
order to make a fight. The House Demo
crats met in caucus to-night to consider
word of praise and that Congress IÂ«i ur^ed
to provide a standing army of ftV.OQO men,
which may be enlarged at th? discretion
of the President to 100,000. The construc
tion of a Pacific cable is urged, too. The
President's reference to the construction
of a canal across the isthmus of '7ontral
America is very brief. It Is understood,
that he will send in a special mes.sa.eo on
this subject, which will embody the re
port of the Isthmian Canal Commission.
This special message will strongly urge
not -only the ratification of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty but also the pass.-.tje of
the Xicaragruan canal bill. The facts as
stated in the commission's report are iin

Senator Ix>dge was called Into the con

would be prepared to proceed with it at
any time, and that he was anxious to
have it disposed of at as early a day as

REDUCTION OF THE REVENUE
The reading occupied two hours and ten
minutes. There were no demonstrations
during the reading, but as the clerk fin

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â Representative
Llttlefleld of Maine, from the Judiciary
Committee of the House, to-day presented
a favorable report of what is known as
the "conspiracy" bill, limiting the use of
restraining orders and injunctions In dis
putes between employer and employed in
places under Federal control. The report
favors two changes in the bill. One strikes
out the provision which would have the
effect of excepting combination trade dis
putes from the operations of the Sherman
anti-trust law. The other amends the bill
so that It will not cover instances of
threats to Injure persons or property,
business or occupation, or overt acts of
interference with the rights of otherr.
Otherwise the bill is preserved in limiting
the scope of Injunctions, conspiracies, etc.

The Speaker then directed the clerk to
call the roll. As soon as the clerk began
the conversation on the floor and in the
galleries was resumed. . The confusion be
came so great that the clerk could not
hear the responses, and the Speaker was
obliged several times to call for order.
The Speaker announced that 275 mem
bers had responded to their names, a'
quorum, and the House was ready for
business.
A rap with the gavel and a report "The
House will be in order" from Speaker
Henderson commanded the assemblage on
the floor and in the galleries to remain
quiet, and then the blind chaplain deliv
ered a prayer. In his invocation the chap
lain referred feelingly to the deaths of the
late Representatives Daly of New Jersey
and Hoffecker of Delaware, which oc
curred during the recess.
When Speaker Henderson called the
House to order at noon the desks of half
the members were freighted with flowers
from admiring frfends or constituents,
;ir.d the profusion of the floral pieces gave
the hall more the appearance of a garden
thun a legislative assembly. The floral
pieces were of infinite variety. Roses, car
nations and chrysanthemums of every hue
were made Into every conceivable design.
The great proportion of flowers were on
the Republican side, and one could mark
the geographical limits of the victorious
party in the recent campaign by the floral
area. Here and there, however, an ad
miring constituent had deposited a bunch
of flowers on a desk on the Democratic
skle. # They usually marked the seat of
one who won a personal triumph. In the
gallery the wealth and beauty of the capi
tal was present, gowned in smart winter
frocks.
* WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â The opening
session in the House was brilliant but not
exciting. There were the usual throngs in
the galleries and the usual display of
floral pieces on the floor, but the proceed
ings were purely formal, consisting of the
rapping to order by the Speaker, prayer
by the chaplain, the roll call of members,
the appointment of the formal commit
tees to wait upon the President and the
reception of and the reading of the Presi
dent's message. Despite the fact that a
great Presidential campaign had conclud

SYMPATHY FOR THE BOERS.
Resolution Introduced by Fitzgerald
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â In the Senate
to-day the work cf the short session of
the Fifty-sixth Congress was successfully
launched. It had been the purpose of the
Senate to announce the death of Senators
Gear (Iowa) and Davis (Minnesota) imme
diately after assembling and then to ad-
Jovrn and to receive the message of the
President to-morrow, but as this had been
announced by the leaders of both
branches of Congress to be a "business
session" it was determined to receive the
massage to-day and thus gain one day in
a session in which that much time may be
of immense Importance. Aside from the
reading of the message and the adminis
tration of the oath of office to William B.
Dillingham, the new Senator from Ver
mont, who succeeds the late Justin S.
Moirill, no business was transacted. The
other new member of the body, former
Representative John C. Dolliver, who suc
ceeds the Â«att Senator Gear of Iowa, was
present throughout the session, but his
credentials were not presented and he was

It has also been agreed that all the
time of the executive session be devoted
to the consideration of the Hay-Paunee
fote treaty till a vote Is had. There will
be no vote on the Nicaragua canal bill
until the treaty i.s out of the way. The
report of the Isthmian Canal Commission
will be laid before the Senate committee
on Nicaragua canal at 10 o'clock to-mor
row.
Senator Hanna said to a Call corre
spondent to-night that he believed Sena
tor Frye's speech will be all the argument
the Republicans needed and that the chief
opposition to it was because it was not
fully understood.
It was decided at a meeting of the Sen
ate steering committee late this afternoon
that the ship subsidy bill should be taken
up to-morrow. A motion to that effect
will be made by Senator Frye, and If it
is carried the shipping bill will take prece
dence over everything else before the
Senate, and Senator Frye will make a
speech explaining the bill. It is believed
by the friends of the bill that It can be
passed within ten days.

any programme. They are like a snake

Allison then announced the death in
July last of his colleague, Senator John

Nelson of Minnesota, who had returned
only two hours before from St. Paul, an
nounced formally the death of Senator
Davis,' saying' that in his death "the na

servants and the State of Minnesota one
of its most distinguished sons."

The Senate then took a recess of forty
minutes, and on reassembling Hoar an
nounced that the President had expressed
his pleasure that Congress once more was
in session and that he would communicate
with it forthwith.
Instantly Major Pruden, one of the sec
retaries of the President, was recognized
and presented the awaited message of the
President. It took Mr. Bennett, the sec
retary of the Senate, one hour and fifty
minutes to read it.
William R. Dillingham was sworn in to
fill tht unexpired term of the late Justin
S. Morrlll.
A resolution by Hoar that a committee
of two Senators be appointed to Join a
similar committee of the House to in

adopted. The chttir appointed Hoar and

. WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. â Secretary
Root's bill for the reorganization of the
army was introduced \ to T day by CHair
man Hull of the House Military Com
mittee and at once referred to that com
mittee. Work on the bill has -been in
progress, and the' measure now is prac
tically completed and ready to be re
ported. The report probably - will be
made to-morrow, and Chairman Hull
says he hoped to begin consideratiqif of
the measure within a 1 day or two, cer
tainly by Friday, with the expectation of
passing it in tne House before the close
of the present. week. Hull says the re
quirements of the military service make
it essential to pass the measure without
delay. One of the changes in the bill
made by the committee to-day was to
adopt an anti-canteen amendment, offered
by Hay of Virginia, prohibiting the sale
of liquor on military property, transports,
etc. Another change made creates an in
spector of artillery, instead of a. chief of
artillery, who is to be on the staff of the

the shadow of the death of two or its
most distinguished members, Since the
Senate last conveneu a great national
campaign has teen inaugurated and con

assembled they exchanged political greet
ings as well as the warm handclasps of
personal lriendshlp. A notable meeting
on the floor just Oei'ore the session opencti

The air of the chamber was heSvy with

The fall of Senator Frye's gavel caused
a hush to fall over the chamber at 12

Secretary Root's : Bill to Receive
Prompt Consideration.
REORGANIZATION OF ARMY.
"K AEHIN'GTON. Dec. 3.-The Republi
can Senatorial Committee on Order of
Business this afternoon decided that the
ship subsidy bill should displace the
Spooncr Philippine bill as the unfinished
business. It also considered at the same
time the disposition of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty, and decided that that ques
tion should receive alternate attention
with the shipping bill. The arrangement
provides that the shipping bill shall have
preference, but that when no one is pre
pared to make a speech on it the Senate
shall go into executive session for the
<onFidÂ« ration of the treaty. *
In accordance with this understanding.
Senator Frye at the first opportunity to
morrow will move to take up the bill, and
if tn,* motion prevail?, as there is little
o^ubt it will, the effect will be to displace
the Spooner bill, which there is no dispo
p.tion at this time to press. Senator Frye
probably will make a speech.
It is not expected that any one other
senator will be prepared to proceed on
the subsidy measure, and in that event
Senator Lodge of the Committee on For-
Relati Â°ns. who will have charge of
the treaty, will move an executive session
in order to consider the treaty.
The arrangement further provides that
lr the army bill reaches the Senate prior
to the disposal of the shipping bill or tne
treaty either or both of these may be dis
placed temporarily in order to permit the
prompt consideration of that measure,
which is considered to be of more press-
Ing Importance than either of the other
questions. The same understanding pre
vails regarding the appropriation bills.
Senator Morgan's Nicaraguan canal bill
received some consideration at the hands
of -the Committee on Order of Business.
While no definite agreement was reached
concerning it. the opinion was generally
expressed that it should wait upon the
Senate's action on the treaty. The mem
bers of the committee apparently consider
that the ratification of the treaty is a nec
essary preliminary to the passage of the
canal bill, and the present disposition is
to contend for that order of precedence.
The committee also discussed the possi
bility of Democratic opposition to the sub
sidv bill. Some of the members who hafi

OAKLAND track reopened yester
day to a large attendance, and as
it afterward transpired one of
the Bharpest, slickest, shrewdest
crowd the bookmakers hare yet
crossed Bwords with. Twenty-one firms
laid odds and with scarcely an exception
received a fearful bombarding. At night
fall the majority were hopefulâ that is If
their bank rolls hold out.
Superintendent "Bill" Fleldwlck had the
surface of the track looking like a piece
of plush, and the horse that couldn't step
a mile over it in "forty" was not consid
ered. SL Cuthbert equaled the coast rec
ord of .1:12^4 for six furlongs, and Head
water caused I:39i4 to be hung out for a
mile. While but three favorites cams
home first, the other three winning horses
aid not escape the talent with Its "dope"
and figures.
Only four started in the Monday handi
cap, at a mile and a sixteenth. Bangor
was down to go, but pulled up lame in
bis preliminary and was excused, all bets
being declared off. ; Those who had ob
tained 5 to 1 against the two-year-old
Tyr, with 93 pounds up, were then com
pelled to take 4 to 5. The youngster was
giving away weight to Malay and Gold
one, but it was thought he was capable
of doing so. Perhaps so, but Jack Martin
tipped the kettle over. He managed to
drop In behind Diderot and Goldone with
his mount and was kept there until too
late to- do any good. Dominlck, astride
Goldone, had clear sailing, and won by a
length. Behind him, Diderot. Tyr and
Malay finished noses apaf t In the order
mentioned.
Charley Ellison, owner of Specific, fa
vorite for the opening mile run, said his
horse would cover the distance in 1:40,
and spread his coin about accordingly.
Specific shaded the time the least bit, but
Headwater happened to be about a pound
and- three ounces better, scoring by a
neck. Coburn piloted the winner, ln fault
less fashion. Snips, at 100 to 1, ran into
the show.

Morrlssey was not good, which caused hla

the big money, managed to get a poor
start and was never prominent. Old

where he fell back, broken down.

third purse from a fair bunch of two-year
old*. Ruling a pronounced choice, it took

the lead, and her stable folks just missed
cashing some very pretty tickets.
None of the events on the card had such
an open look as the fifth, with Gibraltar,
Theory, St. ' Cuthbert, Miss Rowenaand
other fast ones to line up. Hildreth's Glb
ialtar at first was chalked up 6 to 5, which
price later lengthened to 3 to 1. St. Cuth
bert looked and acted well, and from 8 the
sprinter's odds were rubbed to 4, and even
lower. Johnny "Woods had the leg up, and
getting away ln the lead was never head
ed, passing the Judges more than a length
before Theory. Gibraltar ended up in

Several days ago The Call published ex

which were on between Ed Corrigan and
his associate, Joe Ullman, and the San
Francisco Jockey Club, represented by
Prince Ponlatowski and his associates. In
Xhe crash in which Corrigan fell Ullman
also went down and the turf of California
was freed from two figures of discredit.
For some time Prince Poniatowski has
been endeavoring to secure the stock
which Corrlgan and Ullman held in the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club, whose prop
erty Is at Ingleslde. â¢
The Crocker- Woolworth Bank, which is
backing Poniatowski ln the San Francis
co Jockey Club, naturally was. deeply
fearful for the success of the venture
while the shadow of the names of Corrl
gan and Ullman was upon It. â¢ Every ef

Racing In California has been freed for
ever from the contamination of Edward
Corrigan. The Influence which prostituted
a legitimate and high-class sport Into a
game of desperate profit for thieves,
blacklegs and scoundrels of every degree
and character has been removed. Ed
ward Corrlgan's name will not be heard
again on the California turf and the sport
which he degraded, which he made a
menace to every home in San Francisco,
will be restored to the plane of decency
in which he found it when he came to
the coast. Edward Corrlgan has been
forced out of the only racing institution
on the coast in which he had a standing.
This must be a subject of congratula
tion to every man who lovea honest sport,
to every one who does not want honest
men to become thieves, to all who fear
influences which breed crimes ranging
from defalcation to murder. Corrigan's
Influence on the race courses of California
has been that of disease. He has run his
race and as far as California sportsmen
are concerned will live only as a disagree
able memory. â¢
that any ruled-off or suspended person
wishing a rehearing must file a written
request with the club before December 10.
Otherwise no notice will be taken of an
application.

when Corrigan and Ullman intimated a

But Corrlgan and Ullman showed their

amounts of their original investments !n
stock, but interest up to date. After kill
ing in San Francisco the sport which
made Ingleslde an Investment of profit,
they insisted that they should be paid in

Corrigan and Ullman have now no more
serums meaning to honest sportsmen of

in this way Ed Corrigan passes from
the California turf. It was his boast that
he always destroyed a ra.ee course which
he could not debauch by his methods and
over which he could rule with a train of
rascals. He bragged also that he could
silence newspaper criticism which was
not to his liking and censure which ex
posed his shameful methods. "When The
Call found it necessary to denounce the
scoundrellsm which was running riot at
Ingleslde under his management, he
caused to be posted on the dead walls of
the city notices that "the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club does not advertise in The
Call."
Ten days later the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club did not advertise in any paper.
Ingleslde was closed by the law. Corri
gan had gone toe far in his attacks upon
decency in sport and honesty In adminis

Once a year the Sorosis members extend
to the gentlemen the hospitality of their

the delights of tlieir club life. This is
a privilege that is greatly sought after by
the sterner sex, and last evening the
blackcoats were as numerous as the hand
some women in ; their stunning costumes
The Sorosis rooms put on a holiday
dress for the affair, and were gayly dec

pf palms and ferna and vines. On the

p^rpCHE momentous question whether
I a rnaie child of American parent
j age, happening to be born abroad,
,,JL can ever become eligible to the
office cf President of the United
States Is still open for discussion and
vajrer. An Incident connected with the
interesting controversy created some com
motion at the Union League Club ln the
Palace Hotel yesterday. The assistance
of the police was sought not to quell a
riot but to prevent one of the parties to a
wager from walking away with a twenty
dollar gold piece pending a decision on the
.foregoing subject.
Eix or ssven months ago D. B. McKln
lay and George Curtis, members of the
club, exchanged opinions on the question.
The outcome of the discussion was a
warer. Mr. McKinlay took the affirma
tive, holding that a son born cf American
parents would be eKgible to the first oftice
la this country even if such son were born
in a foreign country. Mr. Curtis took the
negative of the proposition. Each put up
520 and agreed that Joseph Simonson,
whose character for integrity Is estab
lished beyond all doubt, ebouid hold tbe
tteke of $10.
Time wore slor.g and still no Judicial de
termination of the problem was obtained.
Judge Kstee. Frank Coombs, Judge
<Jaroutte, Dan T. Cole, Colonel Jefferson
UoolitUe, Colonel George H. Pippy. Sam
uel M. Shortridge, ex-Senator A. P. Wil
liams end many ethers expressed their
views. The preponderance of the expres
sion was largely in D. E. McKinlay'a fa
vor. Mr. Curtts. however, wanted a de
cision by the Federal Judges. W. V. Mor
row and J. C. de Kaven, but he could not
obtain their judgment.
In the course of time Mr. Simonson was
called East. Before his departure he ar
ranged with the principals of the wager
to transfer the etake to Mr. Cory and it
was no transferred. After an absence of
K-veral weeks Mr. Simonson returned to
San Francisco and found that a decision
had not been rendered. He had no incli
nation to resume his position as' stake
holder, but at the urgent request of Mr.
Cory reluctantly consented to again take
charge of the money, as' the principals
wore willing that the second transler
should bt made. Accordingly the parties
concerned went into the office of the club
yesterday to witness the reconveyance of
the coin *to the original stakeholder.
As the money vas placed on the desk
D. E. McKinlay is willing to leave the
whole question in dispute to The Call, and
this journal doea not hesitate to assert
that if the American flag be hoisted by
American parents at tho time of the birth,
no matter in what land the boy happens
to be born, he will be eligible to the office
of President.
A suit in replevin may be Instituted to
enable Curtis to draw down his "twenty,"
but such a proceeding. If succesful, would
still leave the main and momentous ques
tion in the air. In that event Mr. AlcKinlay
would haul down his golden piece, and the
wonder would still be whether an Ameri
can boy, bo unlucky as to be born In an
other country, could ever become Presi
dent-of the United States.
The upshot of the affair was a journey
of ell parties to the Hall of Justice. In
the office of the Chief of Police and ln the
District Attorney's office Curtis was ad
vised to pay the money" to the stakeholder.
After several warnings he surrendered the
coin to Mr. Simonson.'
At this stage of the game Curtis con
cluded that it would be clever to walk
eway with the coin and give Simonson
time to reflect, but Simonson quickly put
c stop to the retreat by Bending the office
boy to summon the police.
An officer came and listened to the
statement of each party, but after listen
ing gave notice that he could not interfere
unless a warrant was demanded. The
original stakeholder gave prompt notlca
that a warrant would be called for if Cur
tis did not surrender the money.
Mr. Curtis reached suddenly, grabbed one
cf the double eagles and placed It ln his
pocket. The act did not accord with Mr.
Hiraonson's sense of Justice or decorum,
hence he demanded that the money should
bo instantly placed in his possession, as
he was responsible as stakeholder until
the bet was - decided. Mr. Curtis declined
to return the money, but offered to give
a receipt for it. Mr. Blmonson, Â¦with firm
ness and alert sagacity, spurned the prop
osition to take a receipt, and reiterated
bis demand for the coin.
ATTORNEY GEORGE F. CURTIS AND THE COMPLICATIONS HE
CAUSED THROUGH HIS EAGERNESS TO REPOSSESS HIMSELF OF
A DOUBLE EAGLE PUT UP AS A WAGER
ii l , ls , known that around the tracks where un
limited-racing Is permitted there gather all
manr.erof disreputable men and women, and that
their corrupting Influences are widely felt, par
ticularly by the young. San Mateo County be
ing ln a ppeclal sense a community of homes
would suffer the gravest evils from the tolera
tion of such a class of persons around a race
track within the county limits. In the county
there are no slums in which touts and toughs
of the track gang could hide out of sight, so
they would be always a conspicuous allurement
to vice. Moreover, the county has no extensivÂ»
bollce force to keep watch on the criminal and
hoodlum elements of the track gangs, and con
sequently their presence In the county would
be a menace to property and person.
Your petitioners for these reasons believe tho
welfare of the county, both morally and mate
rially, demands that strict limitations be put
'Â¦ REDWOOD,- CITY, Dec. 3.â Racing in
San Mateo . County is to be limited to
thirty days in each fiscal year. This
and no more^can the horsemen have for
their sport. The Supervisors of the
county have not yet adopted the ordi
nance which will make this restriction
a law, but they have indicated their pur
pose to do so and steps have already been
taken which advance the reform well on
toward accomplishment. An exciting
meeting of the Supervisors was held to
day to consider the matter and on De
cember 17 it is expected that the ordi
nance-of restriction will be adopted.
When the Supervisors met- to-day, the
Rev. Dr. Martin, one of the prominent
clergrymen of the county, appeared with
a petition asking that racing be limited
In the county to a period of thirty days,
lne reverend gentleman represented men
-2Li claB ses, creeds and reputable con
dition in the county. The petition was
Bignea by these men and was as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of
can Mateo County:
Your petitioners respectfully request the en
actment of an ordinance forbidding horse rac
ing in this county for more than thirty days
1" *ny fiscal year.
This petition Is founded upon a desire to
protect the county from the evils that invari
ably result from unlimited racing. Wherever
eucn racing has been permitted there has been
aeveioped in the community a practice of
habitual gambling that has affected every class
or the community and produced all forms of
cr 'me from embezzlement to suicide.
t- T i. e e Mrience ot aI1 Kreat cltI Â« a ln
United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific
Coast has demonstrated that there Is a wide
difference between legitimate racing held for
a limited season in each year and designed for
hr.1. 61 3f Â°) IraBe , ment of horeo breeding and that
unlimited racing whose chief object Is to pro
Â¦ e . |d a i? e . an * for Rambling. The one Jias been
Â« tu^t c e com , mun| ty. the other has been
5Â»vii i Ji no ' orlou! > have been the crimes
Â»lu W? directly from track gambling that
unlimited racing Is now prohibited in every
important community ln America.
The crimes resulting from the allurements
and corruptions of track gambling in San
Francisco were such as to compel the closing
of the track there. Among those crimes were
aeralcatlons, robberies, murder and suicide
P. or were those offenses committed solely by
low and vicious men. On the contrary, some
cf the most respected families ln the city are
mourning to this day because some member was
tempted to crime by associations with the
track.
Special Dispatch s to The . Call.
Supervisors of the County Will Limit
the Game to Thirty Days' Sport
in Every Fiscal Year.
" ; - .", â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦*
upon horse racing here, as Is done elsewhere,
and accordingly we petition, that such limit be
fixed at thirty days tn each fiscal year.
; Accompanying the petition was the pro
posed ordinance limiting racing to thirty
days. The document was as follows:
ORDINANCE. XO.....^_ '>:' V*
â¢The Board of Â¦ Supervisors of the county of
San Mateo do ordain as fellows:
'Section I.-. It shall be unlawful for any pec
son, firm, partnership, association, corporation
pr individual, at any place within the county
of San Mateo, either within or without the in
closure of a race track, park or grounds, to
hold. or give or permit or conduct horse race*
or. horse race meetings or contests of speed
or endurance " between horses for any purse.
Stake or premium for any period of time longer
fhan twenty-four days In or during any nscal
year in the county of San Mateo.
Â¦Sec 2. It shall be unlawful for any person,
nrm. Individual, corporation or association own-
I"K or operating or conducting or In control
pf any racetrack, park or inclosure within the
county ot San Mateo whereon races have been
held during any n>cal year, for the time per
mitted by this ordinance, to thereafter, during
Â»uch fiscal year, permit or suffer or allow any
other person, firm, association, corporation or
Individual' to hold, conduct, manage or take
part In any hone race or any contest of en
durance or speed or race between horses within
said racetrack, park or inclosure.
bÂ«?c. 3. Any person, firm, association, cor
poration or - individual violating aay of the
provisions of this ordinance shall bÂ» deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a
Rue not exceeding $500 or Imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both.
The presentation of the petition and the
proposed ordinance provoked a discussion
which was extremely - animated, and
reached at one stage a point where the de
oaters called one another emphatic triflera
with the truth. The Rev. Dr. Martin
pleaded eloquently for the ordinance on
the lines suggested in his petition. He
was followed by his only antagonist, W.
J. Martin, president of the South San
Francisco Land and Improvement Com
pany, who appeared for the racetrack peo
ple of Tanforan and. he said, for other
property interests, including the San
Francisco and San Mateo Railroad Com
pany. While he was speaklns the Rev. Mr.
Martin interjected, and both gentlemen
were called to order by President McEl
voy of the Board of Supervisors.
President McElvoy announced that the
board had decided to limit racing in the
county to thirty-six days, but the mem
bers had no wish to take snap judgment
on the racing men, and woujd net Decem
ber 17 for the final hearing of the case.
The racing men will then be heard, but
no petition fromÂ»them is desired.
This places racing In San Mateo In a
peculiar situation: If the ordinance had
been adopted to-day it would have re
mained, in accordance with the wishes of
the Supervisors, to read twenty-four
days, as Tanforan has already had twelve
racing days, and thirty-six days are to
be the limit. If the ordinance is adopted
on December 17 It will read twelve days,
as Tanforan will then be commencing a
twelve-day meetinp. and the ordinance
will not go into effect until fifteen days
after its adoption. It is very clear, there
fore, that racing is limited to thirty-six
days in the county. * -â¢

of an opinion in the United States Su

COUNTESS CASTELLANE'S
INCOME IS LIMITED
Suit to Restrain Trustees Is Heard
Before Judge Leventritt of
Supreme Court.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.â The suit of An
tone J. Dittmar against George J. Gould,
Howard Gould, Edwin Gould and Helen
M. Gould as trustees under thÂ© will of
Jay Gould, to restrain them from, paying:
the Count and Countess de Castellane any
portion of their income from the Gould
property, was called in the Supreme Court
to-day before Justice Leventritt.
Colonel E. C. James, who appeared aa
counsel with Charles A. Gardiner on be
half of the Gould family, asked for an ad
journment on the around that the affi
davits had not been obtained from France
from Count and Countess de Castellane.
A representative of the law firm of Gugr-
Eenhelmer, Untennyer & Marshall, at
torneys for Dlttmar, asked that the mat
ter be held over until the second call of
the calendar, and Justice Leventritt ac
quiesced. #
Colonel James, the attorney for the
Goulds, made additional application to
have the injunction order modified to the
extent that the trusteoa could pay out of
the income of the trust funds at thÂ© rate
of $25,000 a month to the Countess Castel
lane. pending the final decision of the
motion. This application was opposed by
Mr. Untenmyer, counsel for the plaintiff,
and after discussion Judge Leventritc
directed all the parties in interest to ap
pear before Justice Fitzgerald, who
granted the original order.
Mr. Gardiner Bald at his office subse
quently that thÂ© matter had been ar
ranged without appearance before Judgo
Fitzgerald, in the following manner:
Pending the hearing and determination
of the Injunction motion the trustees of
the estate of Jay Gould are permitted to
pay to the Countess Castellane onÂ»
twentieth of $250,000 each month on the
first day of the month, beginning with
the first of December. 1900, and except as
thus modified the injunction order is to
remain for the present as originally,pro
posed by Judge Fitzgerald.

SANTA ROSA, Dec. 3.â The body of a
tramp was found 100 yards from the resi
dence of Paul Coulter, at the southern
edge of Santa Rosa, this evening, by Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Ely, who were walking
along the railroad track to the city. A
portion of the skull had been torn away
and at first it was regarded as almost a
certainty that the fellow had been. struck
by the southbound evening passenger
train and killed. Later developments, how
ever, gave rise to a suspicion that he may
have been a victim of foul play. When
Mr. and Mrs. Ely came across the body
it lay in a perfectly natural position, as
though the unfortunate man had been
killed while asleep. At about 7 o'clock
the police arrested a drunken man in that
vicinity, and it is possible that he may be
able to throw some light upon the mys
tery. The fact that Paul Coulter heard
two men quarreling at 6 o'clock at the
point where the tramp's body was found
gives color to the theory that the dead
man was not the victim of a railway acci
dent.

The chapter of the report treating of
military operations In the Philippines is a
recital of the features of campaigns that
were conducted In the Islands during the
past year. It is said the purpose was to
pursue the bands of Filipinos scattered
throughout the islands. The effort was
successful and resulted in the further and
practically complete disintegration of the
insurrectionary bands: In the rescue of
nearly all the American and Spanish pris
oners; in the capture of many of the lead
ing insurgents and the destruction of
large quantities of arms and supplies.
Secretary Root says that with the exe
cution of the military plans there, all for

thority In the Philippines terminated,
leaving only an exceedingly vexatious and
annoying guerrilla warfare of a character
closely approaching brigandage, which
will require time, patience and good Judg
ment to^nally suppress.

FORMER CADET BOOZE
DIES IN GREAT AGONY
Claimed Illness Was Ihie to a Hazing
He Received at West
Point.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 3.â Oscar L.
Booze, a former cadet at West Point Mili
tary Academy, who had been lying at the
point of death at'his home in Bristol, Pa.,
suffering from injuries which hls"p"arents
cla.im were the result of hazing at the
academy over two years ago, died to-day
in great agony. The cause of death was
throat consumption. It is alleged by the
young man's father that tobasco sauce
was poured down his son's throat while
the cadets were hazing him. The father
also claims that red peper was thrown In
his eyes, hot grea.se poured on his bare
feet, a tooth knocked out and that other
rtendish methods were indulged in. Short
ly after this, the father says. Oscar, be
cause of his physical condition, was com
pelled to resign his cadetship. The young
man grew steadily worse, but never
would divulge the names of the cadets
who 111 treated him. His parents told him
it was his duty to tell, but his only an
swer was: "I went there expecting to
take whatever medicine was given, and
it would not be right to complain against
the other boys."
WEST POINT, N. Y., Dec. 3.â Before
the death of young Booze at Bristol. Pa.,
was announced to-day, Colonel A. L.
Mills, superintendent of the military
academy, made the following statement:
"The many statements made in the
press of the country alleging that Oscar
L. Booze was atrociously hazed while he
was a cadet at the military academy to
such an extent that he is now dying from
Its effects, are untrue and ridiculous. Ex-
Cadet Booze was admitted to the military
academy June 20, 1S98, and resigned Octo
ber 31, 1808. He was on sick report but
once on July 30, when he was excused
from the drills on account of diarrhoea.
Had he been brutally beaten In a fight
with another cadet or had his throat been
injured in the manner claimed it would
have been Impossible for him to have
avoided the sick report. The reason given
for his resignation was weak eyes. His
record shows he was in the last section
in mathematics and the marks he re
ceived to date of his resignation were defi
cient. I believe herein lies the real cause
of his resignation, and I think it most
probable that stories of his alleged ill
treatment arise from statements he mada

COAST BREVETIES.
PARIS, Dec. 3.â The hearing of the
libel suit brought by Colonel Henry's
widow against M. Joseph Reinach, who,
in axticles published in the Siecle, accused
Henry of being the real traitor in the
Dreyfus case and said Esterhazy was his
accomplice, opened to-day in the Assize
Court. The audience was small. The ar
rival of former Minister of "War Cavag
nalc and Generals Mercier and Roget,
who are among the witnesses, numbering
altogether about 500, did not lead to any
incident worthy of note.
It is said M. Reinach has summoned
Dreyfus as a witness. The trial has been
frequently postponed for various rea
sons. At the outset of the hearing to
day the public prosecutor submitted- that
the Assize Court was not competent to
try the case and asserted that the Cor
rectional Court was the proper tribunal.
Maltre Leboire, for M. Reinach, ex
plained that the latter desired an im
mediate trial, not a postponement until
amnesty was enacted, adding that they
wanted full light on the subject. The
court decided it was competent to try
the suit, whereupon the public prosecutor
announced he would appeal to the Court
of Cassation against its competence.

LEGAL QUIBBLE
IN HENRY CASE
LONDON. Dec. 3.â The opening of the
Initial session of the Fifteenth Parliament
of Queen Victoria, occurred at 2 o'clock
this afternoon. It was a formal affair and
of little public interest. A small crowd
assembled to see the "beefeaters," who
carried out the usual search for possible
conspirators in the vaults beneath the
houses of Parliament with the customary
ceremonial and with the customary result.
There was likewise the usual competition
of zealous members of Parliament to be
first on the scene, and J. C. McDona, Con
servative member for the Rotherhithe di
vision of Southwark, easily secured the
choice of seats, arriving in the House at
midnight.
Although the only business before the
Hou6e was the election of a Speaker, the
attendance of members waa good in epite
of the absence of the Irish members. Mr.
Balfour, the Government leader in the
Houee and First Lord of the Treasury,
and Mr. Chamberlain, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, arrived promptly
at 2 o'clock and were cordially welcomed
by their supporters. Sir William. Vemon
Harcourt and Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman, the Liberal leader in the House,
were similarly greeted from the opposi
tion benches.
Geraid Michael Biddulph. the gentleman
usher of the Black Rod. appeared a few
minutes later and summoned the members
to the upper house to hear the reading of
the Queen's commission directing the
election of a Speaker. There waa no op
position to the re-election of William
Court Gully for a third term. Congratu
latory speeches followed. Tuesday and
Wednesday will be mainly devoted to
swearing in members.
The real work of the session will begin
Thursday with the reading of the Queen's
speech and the debates on the reply to
the address from the throne in both
houses.
The House of Commons adjourned until
2:45 p.-m. to-morrow. .
Only a handful of persons attended the
opening of the House of Lords, the dusky
surroundings of which, however, were
brightened by the presence of a number
of ladies. The Lord Chancellor, the Earl
of Halsbury, promptly dispatched the
Black Rod to summon the Commons. On
the arrival the royal commission was read
and the Lord Chancellor directed the
Commons to return to .the House and elect
a Speaker.

was acting under his own discretion, and
it was regarded as probable that he would
seize upon the opportunity afforded by his
visit to make some representations to the

COLOGNE, Dec. 3.â Mr. Kruger, afrer
he had received Emperor William's tele
gram, spoke as follows to a deputation
styled "Friends of the Boers":
"I hope with all my heart that the cir
cumstance which prevents his Majesty
from receiving me to-day will become
more favorable later. I shall never ceasj
to have confidence in the spirit of justice
of the Emperor, who. without know.r.s
me, sent me four years ago significant en
couragement. I shall stay some time at
i The Hague and will then renew my re
quest, and thl3 time the Emperor will rot
refuse."
Mr. Kruger was very sad, and afterward
retired to nis apartment in tears.
PARIS. Dec. B. â Emperor William's tel
egram to Mr. Kruger refusing to receive
him continues to be the chief subject et
comment in the French press. The aftr^
noon newspapers strike a note of sadnrsn.
They say they see in ais Majesty's action
the shattering of his reputation for chiv
alry. The Temps and Journal des Debate
explain Emperor Willie n's message by
the Anglo-German understanding on Afri
can rjuestions.
The Temps says: The Emperor's word
ing, that he would not receive Mr. Kro
ger on account of his position already
taken, is very clear. Every one under- .
stands that the Emperor, if not actually
fulfilling one of the clauses of the recent
Anglo-German accord, ia Inspired by the
spirit thereof in declining to receive Mr.
Kruger. Neither the declarations of
Count von Bulow or others have con
cealed from the eyps of the world that the
Emperor has declared his policy in favor
of England since he sent his famous dia
patcn on the Jameson raid. Mr. Kruger'g
advisers neither saw ncr foresaw any
thing, and they exposed Mr. Kruger to
the total check he has just experienced.
This perhaps is not -he first bad advice
they gave him. which explains many
things in the past.
Yves Guiot In the Sieele compares the
attitude of Emperor William with that ot
France, to the advantage of the former.
He says:
"Emperor William wished to show that
his Government had not surrendered its
power to the least enlightened class, and
intimated to Mr. Kruger that he was op
posed to his coming to Berlin to be ac
claimed by bands led by Mr. Leyds and
paid agitators. I can confirm to a certi
tude that if Mr. Kruger approaches the
Czar diplomatically he will meet with an
equally categorical refusal."

KAISER'S REBUKE
After a Brief Speech He
Retires to His Room
in Tears.
self. The letters had been destroyed. He
had taken defendant riding before she
went to Excelsior Springs, but never after
she returned from there. He had spent
several evenings with her at her brother
in-law's house and mentioned one evening
when he had been there at the invitation
of Miss Morrison. "I'll fix you," Castle
said she had told him as he left the house.
Qn cross-examination Castle admitted
that Miss Wiley objected to his wearing
ties made by Miss Morrison; that she had
become angry at defendant when shown
the Excelsior Springs letter, and that Miss
Morrison had never threatened Miss
Wiley, but, instead, expressed a desire to
bo friendly with her. In telling of defend
ant meeting him near his house, Castle
said he had told Jessie Morrison that if
she did not go away he would set the dogs
on her.
Just before Castle was dismissed from
the stand this afternoon the attorney for
the defense, looking witness squarely in
the face and speaking slowly; said:
"You have told what there was in
your relations with Jessie Morrison?"
Witness did not flinch when he replied,
"Yes, sir." , '
"There was nothing more intimate than
you have told?"
"No, sir."
The State concluded the examination of
its witnesses to-night. It used forty of
the fifty-one witnesses It had subpenaed.
An effort will be made by the prosecu
tion to-morrow to introduce into the evi
dence the clothes worn by Mrs. Castle at
the time she was assaulted, and a writ-
ten statement of hers, which purports t
be her dying statement.
The defense will fight the introduction
of this evidence. Judge Shinn has ruled
once that the clothes should not be ad
mltted in evidence. â¢
Later In the week Miss Morrison will
take the stand in her defense.
Mrs. Castle's dying statement was
made public to-night. It tells how Jessie
Morrison called on her on the morning of
the assault and how they discussed Miss
Morrison's relations with Castle. Miss
Morrison had a letter and asked if Mrs.
Castle had written it. Mrs. Castle said
no. The statement goes on:
"Jessie at first denied all that I told her.
but finding that it was of no use she then
confessed it all and said: 'We!!, you may
read the letter.' As she said this she
arose from the lounge and. passing in
front. of me and to my right, looking out
of the door, she asked me if there was
any one about the house. I saw the letter
In her left hand when she arose from the
lounge.
"The next thing I knew Jessie Morrison
struck me across the throat with a razor
which she had in her right hand. I do
not know where she took the razor from.
I tried to defend myself the best I could
from the blows. I cut my fingers In try
ing to get the razor from her. 1 also
screamed all I could. She was on top of
me. She got off of me and cut herself in
the throat and arms. I saw her do it.
"I do not know how many times Jessie
cut me or struck me with the razor, but a

the latter's fatal quarrel with Mrs. Castle.
Those who expected thafiils cross-exam

Miss Morrison riding, had accepted ties

Miss Wiley, who afterward became Mrs.

made her angry with Miss Morrison. He
also admitted that Miss Morrison had
never threatened his fiancee, but instead

CHICAGO, Dec. 3.-Five raifway em
ployes were instantly killed and twelve
persons Injured by the explosion of a
boiler-house of the Chicago and North
western Railroad this evening. Four of
the Injured are hurt so badly that they
may die. The d,ead":
AUGUST CLAMMAN, section foreman,
crushed by falling walls while standing
near power-house.
ANTHONY KRAUSE, fireman at pow
er-house, internally injured; died on the
way to hospital.
AUGUST WEISS, section hand, struck
by boiler.
JOSEPH S. SPECHT, section hand,
caught under boiler.
HENRY SCIINUR, IS years of age.
clerk in auditing office of Northwestern
Railroad, neck broken by flying debris
while walking past power-house, ,
The seriously injured:
John Butterworth, chief electrician of
power-house, skull fractured, Internal in
juries; will probably die.
August Beck, Milwaukee, injured bv
part of roof of a parlor car falling on him.
Mrs. August Beck, Milwaukee, thrown
against seat; intf rnally injured.
Michael McGregor, severely burned;
may die.
A number of strangers were standing
around watching the dynamos in the elec
tric light plant.
Just as the explosion occurred the Ash
land limited train was pulling out of the
station. The greater part of the train had
l-assed and, although all the cars were
heavily battered with falling bricks and
df bris, only the last two coaches, a I'ul!
man sleeper and a drawing-room car, were
badly damaged. The boiler head and the
boiler Itself caught these coaches. The
boiler struck the rear car, while the boiler
hpad plowed through the one immediately
ir. front. Fortunately both Hew high and
struck the cars above the windows, carry-
Ing away portions of the roof and vesti
bule. Few of the passengers happened at
the time to be in the ends of the two cars
hit by the flying metal, and such of them
as were hurt were struck by flying splin
ters or suffered from being thrown vio
lently to the floor. '
On the train were Mr. and Mrs. August
Beck of Milwaukee and Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Bicker of Sheboygan, Wis. Both
couples were returning from their bridal
tour and all four were injured. Mrs. Beck
was dashed against a seat In the car and
sustained internal injuries which may
prove fatal. Neither of the cars was
thrown from the track, and the engine
drew them quite a distance before coming
to a stop. Traffic, however, was inter
rupted for nearly four hours. The destruc
tion of the electric lighting plant plunged
the station into darkness and the pile of
debris thrown across the tracks tempor
arily blocked suburban traffic. The cause
of the explosion la not known. The prop
erty loss to the road will be $100,000.

The preat range area west of the ninety-ninth me
ridian must resort to leasing and restoration, or the
only industry for which much of it is fitted must pass
The consumer has a direct interest in increasing
the supply. There is but one way to such increase,
and that is by restoring the carrying capacity of the
ranges. They have now only one-third the capacity
they had six years ago. Two-thirds of the area is
obsoleted by absolute extirpation of the forage. The
cattle industry has vanished and left drought and
desert behind it. The only increase of the forage, and
therefore of the carrying capacity of the range, is in
Texas. That State leases the ranges, and the Agri
cultural Department has aided the leaseholder in re
seeding the ranges and' renewal of their forage.
This is a decline in range cattle of 66 per cent in
six years. No wonder that butcher's meat is higher
on the block.
The receipts at Chicago of range cattle exhibit a de
cline that is common to all slaughtering centers. In
1895 Chicago handled 429,300 head; in 1896, 272,000;
in 1897, 236,300; in 1808, 195,175; in 1899, 177,300; in
1900, 142,600.
The decline of the stock industry, brought about by
destruction of the feed on the free range, has at last
reached the consumers of meat in the form of a
higher price for that food. The marketing of range
cattle for 1000 is about over and shows a progressive
decrease.

l iE have in times past sought to impress upon
\\f the reading world the delights of our winter
climate by comparing it to that of Italy. We
have written of our "Italian skies," of our days as
'charming as those in the Riviera," and we have
spoken of California zs "the Italy of America." It is
time to drop all that sort of comparison. We are
injuring the State when we use it, for there is nothing
in Italy that in any way equals the charm of a Cali
fornian winter.
Here is a case in point. On November 14 the
Westminster Gazette of London published a letter
from a private correspondent in Milan, in which the
writer said: "What a wretched place is Milan in
wintry weather! Lately the streets have been deep in
slush or sticky with mud. * * * Everywhere for
days the fog has been of the thin, peasoup variety.
To step in and out of a cab was enough to condemn
any poor creature in petticoats to a deep mud trim
ming at the hem of her garment, and all Milan seemed
to cough as if it had but one choked lung."
Just contrast that with the weather we are having
all over California since the rains came to start the
grass growing in the valleys and on the hillsides. It
is true the reference to the "one choked lung" sug
gests Los Angeles; but that is not because of any
defect in the Los Angeles climate. The one lungsters
in that place are not natives, nor are they persons of
long residence. There, as elsewhere in California, the
winter season is one of wholesome air and general
joyousness. Let us hear no more talk about "the Italy
of 'America" in connection with this State. Florida
may have that title if her people wish it. There is
but one California on earth, and it has no rival.

"I believe that by the conservation of
energyâ by the elimination of the middle
men and of the Idea of competition, every
man, woman and child could live well,
without money or overwork."
"You may buy clothes at less than the
cost of manufactureâ yet many men have
to go about with ragged clothes. Why?
Because of lack of system.
"In Maine," eaid Mr. Peck, "the apples
rot on the ground, yet here people starve.

be put Into operation. Indeed, he is con
fident t^at before the first quarter of the
twentie'.. 1 century shall have ended the
entire United States shall have become
one grand co-operative concern, with ev

all enterprises shall be under national
ownership, all middle men, stock Jobbers,
agents and drummers shall have been
done away with; every commodity shall
be made and sold at the lowest cost and
the lowest price, and every citizen shall
enjoy to the fullest the result of his la
bors.
According to Peck's great scheme, no
person who is willing to work shall be in
fear of want through illness or lack of
work.
Peck comes from Lewiston, Me., where
he Is at the head of one of the largest
dry goods houses in New England and
president of the largest real estate com
pany. He Is also president of the Jollet
(111.) Dry Goods Company.
A MILD mannered man, whose aim In
life Is to make of the world one
grand "department store," Is a
guest at the Everett House, says
the New York World. His name Is
Bradford Peck. He is wealthy and an en
thusiast on the subject of solving all so
cial and economic questions by the forma
tion of "The People's Trust."
Mr. Peck Is In communication with
prominent ministers, teachers, leaders and
capitalists and expects soon to Interest
them in the movement. He began life as
a cash boy for Jordan, Marsh & Co. of
Boston.
"The movement will tend to depopulate
great cities like New York, for men will
not have to herd In tenements. The farm
cr, like the doctor, can live in a com
fortable apartment and go to and from
his work as easily as do the merchants of
New York who live far up on the Hud

"Every man will do his share of work,
according to his ability, and shall receive
for life enough to support himself well.
"There will be no trust but the people's
trust. Everything will be under national

"From the city of Lewlston, we hope,
the movement will soon grow over the en

I predict the entire people of the country

"Now. that Is just how we expect our
movement to grow. When, as we hope in
the near future, an organization shall
control not only restaurant but model
dwellings and stores, and the people of
Lewleton see how one-quarter of the city
has developed. It Is safe to say that they
will soon fail into line.
"All the members of the association
should profit by every enterprise. All de

everything can be bought.

in the profits, but he wants to go further.
"The movement so far," said Mr. Peck,
"has proved successful and profitable â the

"protest against competitive waste and

â¢ - F:>r these reasons the majority should not pause
nor falter in accomplishing all that it put in issue
and risked in the ballots
. These are the great business measures of what
I-romis.es to be a business session of Congress. If a
disappointed minority attempt to fritter away the time
hÂ« frivolous discussion and bombastic appeals to the
country, let it be remembered that an appeal on these
issues has just been heard by the country and decided
against that minority. The maritime States of Maine,
New Hampshire. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con
necticut. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware. Maryland. California, Oregon and Wash
ington, joining the lake States of Minnesota, Wiscon
sin, Illinois, Michigan. Indiana and Ohio, have de
cided the appeal, and there can be no motion for a
i:ew trial entertained until 1004. What unspeakable
folly it would be to pause now and wait, as the mi
nority will demand, until thrv can reargue the issue!
In its strictest sense there is no minority, and we are
sorry for it. The leaders like Jones and Stone, and
newspaper organs like the Examiner. Journal and
World, and the Southern press, are busy as
suring the country that they were not sin
cere in their support of the "paramount" and
"immediate" issues of the late campaign. No one is
bound to heed their protests as to any issue, since
they have no proof that they mean what they say. A
real minority must issue from the chaos on that side,
led by men who will be believed by the country when
they take a position upon any of the great questions.
Shipyards can be kept bus.y here for years to come,
and marine architecture and construction be made per
rnanent industries for cur people if we now make our
selves fe!t in favor of the canal and shipping bill.
The protocols negotiated by United States Minister
.Merry with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and signed
last week at Washington, fairly open the canal ques
tion. It feems now that the canal is to be neutralized
and under American control. All the rights we need
on the soil of the two isthmian republics are provided
for in the protocols, to be secured in the treaties
which will follow. The construction of the canal
should be a matter of months rather than years. If
pushed with the energy which was shown by the build
ers of our first overland railroad ships built under the
encouragement of a revival act could hardly be ready
in time to take cargo and steam through it at the fin
ish. The engineering problems are simple, and it is
only a question of money and energy. Let this be
borne in mind, that construction of the canal will b:
a great economy in transportation and will be
followed by a great expansion of ship-building. This
vas the result when the mapping of ocean currents
and winds, and the development of Great Circle
tailing, by Maury, economized ocean transportation
'\) the amount of sevral millions a year. The revival
Â«iue to canal construction will be greater than that,
since the actual economy in time and distance will be
.greater and the commerce economized is vastly larger
in volume. The Pacific Coast is now in a position to
profit by re-creating cur merchant navy. We build
ships here, and the canal and the Pacific trade will re
quire fleets of them. With us it is a question whethc
these fleets shall be under the flags of Great Britain,
Germany and Norway, or under our own.
The building of an isthmian canal is almost second
ary to the need of our own ships to carry through it
our own commerce.
We find ourselves now able to feed the world, to
clothe it and to manufacture for it, but able to carry
only nine per cent of our foreign trade under our flag!
THERE is no doubt that the great contests of
this session of Congress will come in the con
sideration of the canal and shipping bills. Both
coasts of the country are at laÂ«t alive to the fact th-.i
the building of the canal only emphasizes the need of
re-creating our commercial marine. We lost our lead
on the sea at the beginning of the Civil War. While
all of our energies were enlisted in that great strug
gle there occurred one of those economic revolutions
which change the face and front of affairs. This was
the substitution of iron for wood in the construction
oi ships. Men now living can remember when it was
hotly argued that an iron ship could not be made to
float, but the discussion was without interest to us. for
we had no metal ships. England at once forged to
the front as the builder of the new craft. She had
been admonished by the condition in which she found
hcrsc'f during the Crimean war, when she had to char
ter American clippers for troop transports to carry
her army to the shores of the Black Sea. English
statesmanship never forgets a lesson of that kind, and.
catching us when our enterprise was either paralyzed
or intensely occupied in a civil war, she made the
most of her opportunity, and so it came to pass that
"Britannia Rules the Wave" soon outpiped "Colurr
bia, the Gem of the Ocean."
THE WORK OF CONGRESS.
THE L.EWIST0N (ME.) DRY GOODS MERCHANT WHO AVERS THAT
THE THEORY OP EDWARD BELLAMY'S "LOOKING BACKWARD"
CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICAL OPERATION.
At present the most serious questions with which
our fruit-growers are concerned in the line of their
work are those of procuring a speedier system of
transportation to the markets of the world and pro
viding for that co-operative method of doing busi
ness which now seems destined to prevail for years
to come in almost all departments of industry. It is
with those issues the convention will deal, and it is
safe to say there will be no lack of sound counsel pre
sented on every point under discussion. The meeting
ii to be one of the most important industrial gather
ings of the season, and the results will well repay all
who attend.
It is now fairly well understood what sections of
California are best adapted for fruit-growing and
what kinds of fruit can be most profitably cultivated
in each, but now a new set of problems confront the
progressive men who lead the industry. The rapid
increase in the output renders it more and more im
portant to provide economical methods of handling
the product, preparing it for market and supplying
it to the consumer. These are large problems and re
quire a business sagacity of a .high order to prop
erly solve them. Fortunately our fruit industry is in
the hands of men quite capable of dealing with all
matters of that kind. The California fruit-growers as
a body are perhaps the most advanced class of rural
workers in the world. They have a fuller knowledge
of the scientific side of their industry and a larger
experience in business affairs than other classes en
gaged in the cultivation of the soil. Thus they arc
well prepared to understand the problems that arise
in their industry from time to time and to deal with
them in the most effective way.
Despite the many advantages of soil and climate,
fruit-growing in California has not been easily built
up. Our orchards are far from the great markets
of the country, and the cost of transportation has too
often been all that the traffic would bear. Moreover,
the conditions of the industry here are so different
from those in the Eastern or Southern States that the
beginnings of the industry were largely experimental.
Many a man planted an orchard without knowing
whether it would succeed, and in not a few cases
failure resulted. Thousands of dollars and much of
time, energy and skill were required to establish the
industry upon the basis it now occupies, and to the
pioneers who led the way in the work, took the
chances and overcame the difficulties California owes
much.
/^Â» ALIFORNIA'S fruit-growers will meet to-day
l^ at Pioneer Hall for their twenty-fifth annual
V -T convention. Were they inclined to do so the
gathering^ could be made the occasion for a review
of the work accomplished by the pioneers and up
builders of the industry that in a striking way would
illustrate the progress that has been made in scientific
horticulture and in the production of wealth from
orchards. It is not for history, however, but for busi
ness the convention meets, and accordingly the pa
pers and discussions will deal with the present and
the future and not, with the past.

BRADFORD PECK OF MAINE
PLANS A "PEOPLE'S TRUST"
The. consumers will soon demand a policy that re
news the raising of range cattle. They have rights
which the Government and all concerned must heed.
The meat-packers and exporters are allies of the con
sumers in urging a leasing policy that will restock
the ranges, as are all the Western railroads, which
depend on livestock for an important part of their
tonnage. The shortage ramifies in many directions.
If the railroads lose tonnage in one direction they
must meet their fixed charges by making it out of a
rise in other articles transported. The issue, viewed
in all its lights, becomes a serious one, and the rem
edy should be sought with intelligence and energy.
It is to be hoped that California will be heard at
Salt Lake in favor of some policy that will save a
great industry and stop advance in the cost of living.
away. The question has passed beyond the stock men
themselves, who are divided in sentiment and quar
reling over what feed is left. It concerns the con
sumer now. The present rise in meat is 20 per cent.
There is no natural reason .why it should not go on
till it equals the 66 per cent decline in range stock.
Upon the subject of the Nicaragua canal the Presi
dent contents himself with the announcement that the
State Department is now considering claims made by
the Maritime Canal Company and the Eyre-Cragin
Company against the Nicaraguan Government, and
overtures for a convention to effect the construction
of the canal, and closes by commending to the atten
tion of the Senate "the convention with Great Brit
ain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and
tc remove any objection which might arise out of the
convention commonly called the Clayton- Bulwer
tieaty."
The length of the message should not deter any
citizen from reading it as a whole. It is an important
and interesting summary of the history of the year
so far as it affects the United States, written by the
man who has been the most potent factor in directing
the course of our country. Upon the side of domes
tic politics it abounds with recommendations of legis
lation needed to confirm existing order and prosper
ity and to make improvement better still. He asks
Congress to insure the continued parity under all con
ditions between our two forms of metallic money,
silver and gold. He recommends the reduction of the
internal revenue tax, the upbuilding of our merchant
marine, the regulation of trusts, legislation for Porto
Rico and the Philippines, the construction of the Ha
waiian cable, and the enactment of many other meas
ures for the general benefit.
Some law of the kind recommended by the Presi
dent is imperatively required if we are to retain a
reputation as a just nation. In this very message the
President has occasion to refer to claims for indem
nity made upon various foreign Governments for
wrongs done to American citizens, and it is clear that
if our Government cannot grant redress to others it
will have but a poor showing on the score of justice
and consistency when it makes demands upon them.
Commenting upon the evil resulting from this con
dition of affairs he adds: "I renew the urgent recom
mendations I made last year that the Congress ap
propriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdic
tion in this class of international cases where the ulti
mate responsibility of the Federal Government may
be involved, and I invite action upon the bills to ac
complish this which were introduced in the Senate
and House. It is incumbent upon us to remedy the
statutory omission which has led and may again lead
to such untoward results. I have pointed out the ne
cessity and the precedent for legislation of this char
acter. Its enactment is a simple measure of previsory
justice toward the nations with which we as a sov
ereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal ob
servance."
Another question of indemnity for international
wrong referred to in .1 different part of the message
may well be considered in this connection â that is
the demand of Italy for redress for wrongs done to
her citizens in this country by mob law in Louisiana.
The President says: "Notwithstanding the efforts of
the Federal Government, the production of evidence
tending to inculpate xhe authors of this grievous of
fense against our civilization, ani the repeated in
quests set on foot by the authorities of the State of
Louisiana, no punishments have followed."
As to the indemnity itself the President says:
"Measured in money alone, a sufficient reparation
may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet.
All the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers of any
purpose of aggrandizement through the dismember
ir.ent of the empire. I am disposed to think that due
compensation may be made in part by increased guar
antees of security for foreign rights and immunities,
and. most important of all, by the opening of China
to the equal commerce of all the world. These views
have been and will be earnestly advocated by our rep
resentatives."
The chief interest in the message not only to us but
to the world at large centers in what is said of the
crisis in China and our relations to it. On that sub
ject the President writes with elaboration and narrates
the proceedings that led up to the Boxer outrages
and brought about the present situation. He an
nounces that the disposition of the Chinese Govern
ment to admit liability for wrongs done to foreign
ers, and "to act upon such additional designation of
the guilty persons as the Foreign Ministers at Peking
may be in a position to make," gives hope of a com
plete settlement of all questions involved. He fur
ther asserts it to be "one of the essential factors of a
durable adjustment" that there be given secure and
adequate guarantees for liberty of faith for natives as
well as for foreigners. Finally he expresses approval
of a suggestion put forward by the Government of
Russia, "that in the event of a protracted divergence
of views in regard to indemnities to be demanded of
China, the matter be relegated to the court of arbitra
tion at The Hague."
T~ PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S message is much
L_-/ longer than necessary. Much of it is devoted
* to an historical review of the events of the year,
and while it is gratifying to have an official statement
concerning the action of our Government in them, it
is to be noted that the statement contains little or
nothing that is new. Information has been fully Riven
out to the press and through the newspapers to the
public, so that virtually all the President has had to
say of an historical character has been fairly well
known.

ment of the condition of the work of tha
United States Supreme Court, which
ehows that 370 appellate cases were dock

were 3137 United States convicts in the
various prisons and reformatories of the
country, against 2933 at the close of the
last fiscal year.
The aggregate amount of the Judgments
rendered in favor of the United States In
civil suits during the last year was
$663,299, and the amount actually collect

SIGMA CHI MEMBERS
TO HAVE A NEW HOME
Another Handsome Lodge Will Be
Added to Those on "Fraternity
Row" at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 8.â
Another residence Is to be added to the
row of fraternity houses on the Stanford
campus. This time it Is the local mem
bers of the Sigma Chi fraternity who
have broken ground. The house will be
located on Lasuen avenue, between the
Delta Gamma and Kappa Kappa Gamma
lodges. This Is the street that Mrs. Stan
ford has set aside for "fraternity row,"
and it Is already famous In the college
world for the beauty and variety of Its
architectural structures.
The new home which the Sigma Chi
boys are building will be a handsome one.
The house will be two and a half stories
in height, massive in its style of architec
ture and beautiful both In exterior and in
terior finish. The ground floor is planned
with a view toward entertaining. The
large reception hall, living-room, library
and dining-room may be thrown open Into
one vast room. Back of the library,
which is on the right of the entrance. Is
a smoking and chapter room. There are
accommodations for eighteen men on the
second and third floors.
The house was to have been built early
In the fall, but the lease of the ground
had to be sent to Europe, as Mrs. Stan
ford's signature was necessary. Thorpe
& Lentz of San Francisco are the archi
tects, while R. C Andrus of San Jose Is
the contractor.

BOLLINGER WELL CASE
â¢ DRAWING TO A CLOSE
Iiegal Fight for Property to the Value
of a Hundred and Fifty Thou
sand Dollars.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 3.â The contest of the.
will of the late Christian Bolllnger, which
has occupied the attention of Judge Hy
land's court for the past twelve weeks, is
drawing to a close. It is expected the tes
timony will close to-morrow and the case
be given to the Jury Friday or Saturday.
Bollinger, who died a couple of years
ago, left an estate worth about $150,000.
Most ot this he gave to his children.
Mary L. Bollinger, a second wife, was
given a home in Santa Clara and other
property, the value of all not exceeding
$10,000. She at once began a contest of the
will, alleging unsoundness of mind and
undue influence on the part of ex-Sheriff
G. Y. Bollinger, a son. It was also
claimed that property held by George Y.
Bollinger to the value of nearly $100,000 be
longed to the estate. The contestant died
before the case came to trial and the con
test is being conducted by her heirs.
SCHOOL WAR RENEWED.
Eastland Seeks to Remain an Inde
pendent District.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 3.â The Mill Valley
school war promises to be renewed. Last
summer, when Mill Valley was Incorpor
ated, it became a new school district. The
citizens then petitioned the Board of Su
pervisors to merge It Into Eastland dis
trict, of which it had previously been a
part. This the board did. To-dav the
people of Eastlancl presented a petition to
the Supervisors asking them to rescind
or annul the order merging the districts.
The petition sets forth that the board
was misled by the first petition. The bone
of contention is a $10,000 bank account ly
ing to the credit of Eastland district from
a sale of school bonds voted and made be
fore the incorporation. Eastland wants
the money for herself, and Mill Valley
does not want to lose her interest In the
funds.

Special Dispatch to Th* CWL
TACO1IA, Dec 8. â Further particulars
of the wreck of the Ill-fated schooner
Fischer Brothers were brought down by
passengers of the steamer Centennial.
They tell a thrilling story of the hard
ships and sufferings endured by the pas
sengers and crew of the unfortunate ves-
Bel, which was commanded by Captain A.
M. Flagg, whose death resulted a few
days later from exposure incurred during
the wreck. Captain Flag'g's body was
brought down by the Centennial.
The Fischer Brothers was driven ashore
and went to pieces abqut the middle of
October on the rocks off Cape Rodney.
For an hour the vessel pitched helplessly
In the water, gradually working In
toward the shore. When within 300 feet
of the beach she hung hard and fast.
From daylight until 10 o'clock a persistent
but futile effort was made to get a line
ashore. Barrels and casks carrying lines
were thrown Into the water. These were
washed to within forty feet of land, but
the undertow caught them and they be
came tangled In wreckage and carried out
to sea. In time, men from an Indian vil
lage brought a boat, but no canoe .could
live In the raging surf. Ona was dashed
to pieces in the effort to reach the
wrecked schooner.
Finally Joseph Patton undertook to
Bwlm ashore with a line. Dropping down
from the Jibboom, he was caught by the
waves and washed over the rocks like a
cork. Meanwhile Samuel Archer, one of
the owners of the vessel, held the end of
the line. Patton persisted In his attempts
to reach land and finally succeeded
through the aid of those on shore. With
this line the rescuers later got a rope
ashore, and with this and a life boat,
â¢which ventured out to the last reef but
one, the crew was taken ashore. The
rope became Icy and several times the
hold of the men was broken by the waves.
Some narrowly escaped drowning, but
were rescued by those in the boat throw
in* ropes to them.
Captain Flagg was the last man to
leave the schooner. It was several hoars
after she struck before he got ashore.
Throughout the ordeal he bore himself as
a brave seaman. The shipwrecked men
sought shelter In the village, and there
dried their clothing. .Archer then set out
to walk to Nome, a distance of fifty miles.
He reached Slnrock River, twenty miles
distant, before nightfall. His clothing
became frozen and at times progress was
next to Impossible; yet he pushed on, and
the following day reached Nome, having
been less than thirty-six hours en route,
with the news of the disaster. He at once
arranged to have the crew taken to
NonloT
When Captain Flagg reached there he
was unconscious. He was taken at once
to the army barracks, where he died two
days later.

SIL.VERTON. Or., Deo. 8.â Dynamite,
used by robbers to open a burglarproof
safe, wrecked the Silverton Bank at an
early hour this morning and aroused the
inhabitants. The cashier, who heard the
report, rushed to the bank In time to be
shot at by one of the fleeing robbers. Be
cause of the Interruption, the burglars
did not have time to obtain any booty.
The bank was a complete wreck, the
damage probably reaching $2700. The
force of the shock blew the outer door of
the safe off its hinges and ruined the
bank's furniture, smashed two large
plateglass windows and blow fragments
of the safe across the street.
Among- the first of the citizens to reach
the bank was the cashier. He saw the
two men and got near enough to order
one of them to halt For reply the rob
ber sent a bullet In the direction of the
cashier. The latter ran back to his room
to gret his revolver, but the men had made
good their escape.

XVI. HOW TOSECKON DISCOUNT
When a reduction Is made from the face
of a bill cr account it is called a dis
count. The manufacturer or wholesale
dealer allows the retailer a trade dis
count, which is deducted at a certain ratÂ«
per cent from the face of the Invoice. By
trade discount is meant a discount to the
trader (dealer) which would not be given,
to a person not in the trade. The amount
of such discount depends sometimes upon
the size of the order and sometimes upon
the terms of settlement. Frequently
goods are sold at net prices; that Is, at a
fixed bottom price, no further dUcount
being allowed. It is a common practice
in some lines of business to allow two or
three discounts in succession: thus, 3Â»
and 10 of!" means 30% discount and tiier
10% discount from the remainder.

an actual bill or invoice the discount can
be written down at once, the work being
done mentally. The discount Is subtracted
and the net amount carried at once to

NIGHT SCHOOL COURSE.
XV. HOW TO AVOID COMMON
BI/ETNDERS.
BY PROP. H. G. BUEHLER.
In the Use of Pronouns.
A pronoun Is a word used to stand for
a noun. Pronouns In English are not nu
merous, but they occur very frequently,
and require more care than almost any
other part of speech.
"We begin by remarking that In forming
the possessive case of. pronouns no apos
trophe Is used by good writers. They
write "ours," "yours," "hers," "its."
"theirs." In this respect, you observe,
the possessive of pronouns differs from
the poesessive of nouna. "It's," which
of tent occurs In writing. Is a contraction
for "It is," the apostrophe denoting the
omission of a letter.
The word "I" Is always written as a
capital letter.
Our next practical caution Is that good
writers and speakers never use the word
"them"" Instead of "those" before a noun.
That is, they freely say "those apples,"
"those things," but never say "them ap
ples," "them things." In Its place "them"
is a perfectly good English word, but it
should always be used Instead of a noun,
not with a noun; as, "X am looking for
my glasses. Have you seen them?"
Error* In the use of the number forms
of pronouns often occur in connection
with such expressions as "anybody, '
"everybody," "each," "either," â¢â¢neither"
and "nobody." Such expressions, in spite
of the comprehensive meaning of some of
them, are grammatically singular; and in
literary English they are referred to by
singular pronouns; as, "If anybody calls,
ask him to wait.'' "kany a brave man
has met his death iri the Spanish war,
"Let each take her turn," ".fc^ery klna
of animal has its own proper food, no
body went out of his or her way to make
me feel at home."
The relative pronoun "what Is 8Â°â¢*:
tlmes misused. " Writers, however, will
have little difficulty with it. if they re
member that, when used as a relative
pronoun, it la equivalent to "tnat which.
We now come to a kind of blunder in
the use of pronouns that Is perhaps more
troublesome than any other. These er
rors are sometimes committed even by
well-educated people; yet they are almost
instantly detected by a cultivated eye or
ear. The fact Is that to avoid them a per
son must have a clear insight into the
structure of sentences, know the differ
ence between what are called the "nomi
native" and the "objective" forms,- and
be perpetually on hla guard. Insight into
the structure of sentences one can hardly
hope to have without such a course in
English grammar as it la impossible to
give In these columns. The difference be
tveen "nominative" and "objective
forms, however, can be explained here
with a concise statement of their proper
use.
Seven English pronouns have different
forms, according as the pronoun is used
as the subject or the object of the sen
tence. For example^ we say "I like her,
and she likes me," changing the form of
the pronouns that denote* the speaker and
the speaker's friend when tha relation
of these pronouns to the verb changes.
These different forms, marking different
structural relations in the sentence, are
called cases. The form of a prwnoun that
marks the relation of subject is called
the nominative case. The form that
marks the relation of object Is called the
objective case. It is clear, therefore, that
in order to use these seven pronouns cor
reotly we must distinguish their nomina
tive from their objective forms, and ob
serve In every instance the relation which
the pronoun bears to the rest of the sen
tence. This, as we have said before, is
not easy without previous training in the
analysis of sentences. The most that we
can do here is to print the forms and
mention their principal uses.
The seven pronouns having different
forms for the nominative and objective
cases are the following:
Nominative. Objective. Nominative. Objective.
I me she her
wo us they them
them theÂ« who whom
he him
The nominative forms of these pronouns
â I, we, thou, he, she, they, who â are used
mainly in the following: relations:
1. Subject of a verb: as. "I am young";
"We are coming"; "He fell"; "She
laughed"; "They live in New Orleans."
2. Attribute complement, describing the
subject: as, "Is it I?" "It was not we";
"Was it he?" "I think it was she"; "No,
It was they."
Exceptionâ The attribute complement of
the infinitive to be is in objective case if
the infinitive has a subject, as, "He knew
it to be me."
3. Vocative, as, "O thou who hearest
prayer."
4. Nominative absolute, as, "He being
there, we said nothing about it."
The objective forms of these pronouns â
me, us, thee, him, her, them, whom â are
used mainly in the following relations:
1. Direct object, as, "Help us, O Lord."
2. Indirect object, as, "Give me your
hand."
3. Object of preposition, as, "Show it to
them."
4. Subject of Infinitive, as, "Did you see
him fall?"
Blunders in the use of the case forms of
pronouns are especially common when the
pronoun is coupled with a name, as in the
incorrect sentence, "She invited Mrs. R.
and I to go driving." In this sentence "I"
should be "me," as any one would know
if he stopped to think what the form
would be if the pronoun were not coupled
with a noun. No one would think of say
ing "She invited I to go driving."
Persons who are in doubt as to which
form of the pronoun to use often try to
avoid the difficulty by using one of the
pronouns ending In "self"â pronouns
which have the same form for Doth the
nominative and the objective case. Thus
many persons, uncertain whether to use
"I" or "me" in the sentence quoted above,
would say Instead, "She Invited Mrs. R.
and myself to go driving." This Is no
better than "Mrs. R. and I" or "Her and
I." The pronouns in "self" are properly
used only for emphasis, or in a reflexive

Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, Deo. 8.â To-day's de
cisive Democratic victoryâ so far, at
least, as the Mayoralty contest Is con
cernedâfollowing so closely upon the No
vember election, when the city gave Mc-
K-lnley 2S00 plurality, has been a surprise
to every one. The Democratic candidate
for Mayor, Meridith P. Snyder, who oc
cupied, that oflice In 1S97 and 1698, is elected
over Herman Silver (R.) by 2000 plurality.
Snyder was the acknowledged candidate
of the liquor interests and that element is
rejoicing to-night. Herman Sliver has
been president of the Council for two
successive terms and enjoys an enviable
reputation a*> a sound man of affairs.
Snyrter was vigorously opposed by three
of the four daily papers.
The Republicans have captured five of
the eight city oliicers. The successful can
didates are:
Clerk â C. II. Hance, Democrat.
Attorney â \V. B. Mat hews, Republican.
Auditorâ Elijah Unger, Republican.
Collectorâ W. A. "White, Republican.
Engineerâ Harry P. Stafford, Republi
can.
Street Superintendent â Hugh J. Mc-
Guire, Democrat.
Assessorâ Ben E. Ward, Republican.
The contest for City Treasurer is still In
doubt. Ex-Mayor w. H. Workman (D.)
is probably elected over W. A. Hartwell,
the Republican incumbent.
The complexion of the Council will be
I seven Republicans to two Democrats. The
i Councilmen elected are as follows:
First Wardâ W. H. Pierce, Republican.
Second Wardâ O. P. McLain. Republi
can.
Third Wardâ Frank "Walker, Democrat
Fourth Wardâ P. W. Powers, Republi

Seventh Wardâ H. E. Lander, Republi

Eighth Wardâ R. A. Todd. Democrat.
Ninth Wardâ E. L. Ulanchard, Republi

At midnight complete returns from 65
out of the 90 precincts gave Snyder (D.)

j \\\, WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.â The most
I important piece of newt In the California
colony to-night Is that the Southern Pa
! dflc Company has on foot a plan to re-
J organize the California delegation. Word
, was received to-day from New York that
; some big banking institutions of that city
j are behind this proposed reorganization.
; and the Southern Pacific's legal depart
; ment In the Mills building. New York,
! with CharleB Tweed -X3 Its head, is now
j drawing up the papers in the matter. De
1 tails of the proposed reconstruction can
| not be disclosed at this time, but, in gen
eral. It may be said that the capital stock
will be divided into different classes. Tho
purpose of this is said to be to niako It
possible to pay dividends on parts of
stock without having to pay on other
parts.
The present capital stock is $250,000,000,
but all the stock Is of one kind. Thus far
it has not been found possible to make
dividend returns to shareholders, but four
per cent can be insured on at least $100,
000.000 by cutting the stock up into differ
ent classes.
The holders of a majority of the stock
have consented to this arrangement, and
of course this includes the Huntingtcn
holdings. It is not known Just what con
sideration will be shown stockholders for
accepting Junior securities, but unless
their Interests are caiefully looked after
the scheme will have no chance of being
adopted. There must and will be an
â¢ equitable adjustment, according to one of
Honors for Roberts.

the Southern Pacific officials. It has
been persistently asserted and as often
denied that the great block of Huntingdon
"stock has been transferred by Mrs. Hun
tington to J. Plerpon* Â¦ Morgan or some
other banking house. Still It may bÂ© said
that ' those denials have always been
formal and did not, seem to be given with

has not conveyed - to others the voting

it may be relied upon that the plan of

few days, and it will not differ materially
from the Atchlson and Topeka and Union
Pacific plans of reconstruction.
HOW goes the little "Fortune Tel
ler." frivolous, frothy, piquar.t
little fantaay, after a solid three
weeks of grand opera according
to Grau? -
By my halidome and by my troth, ex
ceeding well:
It is to laugh, the "Fortune Teller." and j
perhaps no prettier or happier contrast j
to the lart three weeks' musical pro- j
examine could have been put on than this
newly imported Victor Herbert success?.
The prolific and versatile composer, sym
phony writer, conductor of one of the |
l>eet symphony orchestras in the country,
composer of pome of the most popular
hght operas now being sungâ has written
nothing more charming from the comic
op^ra standpoint than the "Fortune Tel
ler," and the "book" by Harry B. Smith
is c-ramraod with good things.
The opera takes a good company and a
hig company for its handling, and little
Alice Nielsen, late chorus girl of San
KranciPoo and a Oalifornlan. brings both
with her in Her first appearance as a star
in her native State. It is indeed a rarely
good company Â¦which supports Miss Niel
sen, numbering among Its members three
excellent comedians â John C. Slavln, Jo
t-eph Cawthorn and Joseph Herbert;
Cowles. the eweet singer; Viola Gillette,
% large and well trained chorus with any
number of pretty girls and the piquant,
fetching, chic little prima donr.a herec-lf.
Miss Xlelsen has a dainty part in the
pretty opera, or. rather, a kaleidoscopic
collection of dainty parts as a gyp.sy girl,
ballet girl, soldier boy and what not. She
is th* 1 smartest, nattiest little wearer of
the shoulder straps and trews imagina
ble, taps the tambourine like a true Ro
many lass, brings down the house with
the inevitable Cakewalk, which only Grau
refuses us! She has pretty songs gaiore
throughout the opera and sings them in
sparkling fashion. One song in particu
lar will catch the larger crowd later, as
It did the audience last night, where Miss
Nielsen demurely explains that it is- al
v.-ays best "to do what one is told, for
grandma told me so." And a serenade of
nil countries, encored seven or eight
times, has a catchy melody that sticks.
Mi?s Nielsen has certainly naught to
oompJain of in her reception last evening.
<ir any other evening of her appearance
here, ar.d the little Californian star
to appreciate the very hearty ap
plause that greeted her efforts.
Eugene Co-wles has an excellent oppor
1 unity in the role, of the srypsy. Sandor.
\\f has many good songs. "My Gypsy
Sweetheart." "A Gypsy Bold," sung wi:h
that satisfying hass of his. Richie Line;
as the captain-lover sings a weak tenor,
tut is picturesque enough. The three
comedians â a most humorous -' trinity -
Plavin aÂ»s a poverty stricken ballet mas
ter; Cawthorn as a gypey with a Flie
gende Blatter accent, and Herbert as the
lanky Polish composer, kept the house In
roars cf laughter from start to finish.
Viola Gillette Is afforded a pood oppor
tunity as the urima donr.a. Pompon, of
which she avails herself, though she is a
little heavy in the role. The rest of the

Mr. Furst has furnished some appro
priate music and the opening tableaux of
Fujiyama by sunrise, at noon and by
moonlight help to give atmosphere to the
play. The setting of the piece Itself Is
both quaint and beautiful and the results
obtained in the New York and London
productions have evidently been carefully
utilized by the stage management. The
only objectionable feature last night was
the undue time consumed In making the
light changesâ unless perhaps the most
prolonged of these was an attempt to con
vey to the audience an impression that
an entire night hail passed during some
five stage minute. If this effect was de
liberately aimed at it was a failure, as all
such attempts must be.
Miss Crosby played with ease ana
charm, though with &o pronounced an ac
cent that many of her words were indis
tinct. That is a mistake, I am sure. In
such a highly conventionalized produc
tion, if we grant that a Japanese char
acter may speak English at all. it should
be English Nipponized just enough to give
a mere suggestion of foreignness and no
more. If more is attempted we get an
often unintelligible and therefore obscur
ing dialect. L. DU PONT SYLE.
of the situations. Miss Convere had little
to <!o save to look pretty and intelligent;
that came to her without effort.
"Madame Butterfly," the little tragedy
that followed, was really a one-part piece
for Miss Crosby, who played the title role.
Humorous treatment of Japanese subjects
has long been common on our stage, but
this is the first play, within my knowledge
at least, where a tragic treatment has
been attempted â and successfully. Cho-
Cho-San's belief that her lover will re
turn, her inability to realize that men
were decivers ever, her joy at his sup
posed returning to her and her hopeless
grief when she learns he can never again
be hersâ all these are of the essence of
universal tragedy, as true in Japan as in
London or in New York. The dramatic
setting in which Mr. Belasco ha3 placed
his theme lend% it enough of novelty to
make interesting what were otherwise a
merely ordinary repetition of a thousand
times-told tale.

of Havana at 12 noon on the first Monday of
November, in the year 1900, to frame and adopt
a constitution for the people of Cuba and as
a part" thereof to provide for and agree with
the Government of the United States upon the
relations to exist between that Government
and the Government of Cuba and to provide
for the election by the people of officers under
such constitution and the transfer of govern
ment to the officers so elected.
"The election wjll be held In the several vot
ing precincts of the Island under and pursuant
to the provisions of the electoral law of April
18. 1900, and the . amendenta thereof."
CUBAN CONVENTION.
The election was held on the 15th of Septem
ber and the convention assembled on the 6th
of November, 1900, and is now in session."
In calling the convention to order, the mili
tary Governor of Cuba . made the following
statement:
'.'As military Governor of the. Island, repre
senting the President of the United States, I
call this convention to order. It will be your
duty, first to frame and adopt- a constitution
for Cuba and when that has been done to for
mulate what. In your opinion, ought to be the
relations between Cuba and the United States.
"The constitution , must be adequate to secure
a stable, orderly and a free government.
"When you. have formulated the relations
which In your opinion ought to exist between
Cuba and thÂ© United States, the Government
of the United States will doubtless take such
action on Its part as shall lead to a final and
authoritative agreement between the people
of the two countries. to the promotion of their
common interests.
"All friends of Cuba will follow your dellb-
I eratlona with the Â¦ deepest Interest, earnestly
I desiring that you shall reach Just conclusions
| and that by the dignity, individual self-re-
Btraint and wise conservatism which shall
characterize your proceedings the capacity of
the Cuban people for representative govern
ment may be slgnall] Illustrated.
"The fundamental distinction between true
representative government and dictatorship is
that the former is representative of the peo
ple. In whatever position the official is he con
fine* himself strictly within the limits of his
j denned powers. Without such restraint there
can be no free constitutional government.
"Under the order pursuant to which you
have been elected and convened you have no
duty and no authority to take part in the
present government ot the Island. Your pow
ers are strictly limited by the terms of that
order.
"When the convention concludes Its labor
I will transmit to Congress the constitution as
framed by the convention for its consideration
and for such action as It may deem advisable."
I â¢ renew the recommendation made in my
special message of February 10, 1S93, as to the
necessity for cable communication between
the United States and Hawaii, with extension
to Manila. Since then circumstances have
strikingly emphasised this need. Surveys have
shown the entire feasibility of a chain of
cables which at each stopping place shall touch
on American territory, so that the system shall
be under our own complete control. Manila,
once within telegraphic reach, connection with
the systems of the Asiatic coast would be in
creased and profitable opportunities for a more
direct cable route from our shores to the
Orient than Is now afforded by the trans-
Atlantic, continental and trans-Atlantic lines. I
urge attention to this Important matter.
ARMY AND FORTIFICATIONS.
The present strength of the army is. 100.000
menâ 65,000 regulars and 35,000 volunteers. Un
der the act of March 2, 1S99, on the 30th of
June next the present volunteer force will be
discharged and the regular army reduced to
2447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.
In 1S8S a board of officers convened by Presi
dent Cleveland adopted a comprehensive scheme
of coast defense fortifications, which involved
the out'.ay of something more than $100,000,000.
This plan received the general approval of
Congress, and since then regular appropriations
havo been made and the work of fortification
has steadily progressed.
More than $6^.000,000 haa been Invested in a
great number of forts and guns, with all the
complicated and scientific machinery and elec
trical appliances necessary for their use. The
proper care of this defensive machinery re
quires men trained In its use. The number of
men necessary to perform this duty alone is
ascertained by the War Department at a min
imum allowance to be 18,420.
There are fifty-eight or more military posts
in the United States other than the coast de
fense fortifications.
The number of these posts is being constantly
Increased by Congress. More than $22,000,000
has been expended In building and equipping
them and they can only be cared for by the
regular army. The pests now In existence and
others to be built provide accommodations for
and If fully garrisoned require 26.000 troops.
Many of these posts are along our frontier or
at important strategic points, the occupation
of which U necessary.
TROOPS IN {THE ISLANDS.
We have in Cuba between D0O0 and 6000
troope. For the present our troops In that isl
and cannot be withdrawn or materially dim
inished and certainly not until the conclusion
of the labors of the constitutional convention
now in session and a government provided by
the new constitution Bhall have been estab
lished and Its stability assured.
In Porto Rico. we have reduced the garrisons
to 1C36. which include S96 native troops. There
is no room for further reduction here. We will
be required to keep a considerable force In the
Philippine Islands for some time to come.
From the best Information obtainable we shall
m-eil there for the immediate future from 50,000
to eo.ox) men. I am sure the number may be
reduced as the- Insurgents shall come to ac
knowledge the authority of the United States,
of which there are assuring Indications.
It must be apparent that we will require an
army of about 60,000 and that during present
crndttlons in Cuba and the Philippines the
Piesldent should have authority to Increase the
fr.rce to the present number of 100,000. Included
in this number, authority should be given to
rclee native troops In the_ Philippines up to
15.000, which the Taft commission believe will
be more effective in detecting and suppressing
guerrillas, assassins and ladrones than our own
soldiers. ,â¢'''
The full,, discussion of this subject by the
Secretary of War in his annual report is called
to your earnest attention.
I renew the recommendation made In my last
annual message that 'Congress provide a spe - 1
clal medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars,
sollors and marines on duty in the Philippines
who voluntarily remained in the service after
their terms of enlistment had expired.
I favor the recommendation of the Secretary
of War for the detail of officers from the line
of the army when vacancies occur In the Adju
tant-General's Department, Inspector-General's
Department, Quartermaster-General's Depart
ment, Subsistence Department, Pay Depart
ment, Ordnance Department and Signal Corps.
The army cannot be too highly commended for
Its faithful and effective services in active mil
itary operations in the field and the difficult
work of Its able administration.
The continued and rapid growth of the postal
service' Is' a sure index of the great and In
creasing business activity of the country. Its
mest striking new development is the exten
sion of rural free delivery. This has come
almost wholly within the last year. At the be-
Clnning of the fiscal year 1893-1500, the number
of routes In operation was' only 391, and most
of these had been running less than twelve
months. On the 15th of November, 1900, tha
number had Increased to 2611, reaching into
forty-four States and Territories and serving a
population of j 1,801,624. The number of appli
cations now pending and awaiting action nearly
equals all those granted up to the present time,
and by the close of the current fiscal year about
4000 routes will have been established, providing
for the dally delivery of malls at the scattered
hemes of about three and a half millions of
rural population. This service ameliorates the
isolation of farm life, conduces to good roads
8nd quickens and extends the dissemination of
general Information. Experience thus far has
tended to allay the apprehension that It would
be so expensive as to forbid Its general adop
tion or make it a general burden. Its actual
application has shown that It increases postal
receipts and can be accompanied by reduc
t'ons in other branches of the service, so that
the augmented revenues and the accomplished
savings together naturally reduce the net cost.
The evidences which point to these conclusions
are presented In detail In the annual report of
the Postmaster-General, which, with Its rec
ommendations, is recommended to the consider
ation of the Congress. The full development
of this special service, however, requires such a
large outlay of money that it should be under
taken only after a careful study and thorough
understanding of all that it involves.
arid regions are receiving careful and increased
consideration.
An extensive exhibit at Paris of the products
of agriculture has made the peoples of many
countries more familiar with the varied pro
ducts of our fields and their comparative ex-
The collection of statistics regarding our
crops is being improved and sources of informa
tion are being enlarged to the end that produc

shown more appreciation of the services of the
department. â¢?."â¢.'.;_.Â¦
In my annual message of December 5, lS'Js.
I called attention to the necessity for some
amendment of the alien contract law. Ther-Â»
still remain Important features of the rightful
application of the eight hour law for the bene
fit of labor and of the principle of arbitration,
and I again commend these subjects to the
careful attention of the- Congress.
That there may be secured the best servlc*
possible In the Philippines. I issued under date
of November 19. 1900. the following order:
"The United States Civil Service Commission
is directed to render sneh service as may bo
practicable to the Civil Service Board created
under the act of the United States Philippines
Commission for the establishment and main
tenance of an honest and efficient civil service
in the Philippine Islands, and for that purpose
to conduct examinations for the civil service
of the Philippine Islands, upon the request cf
the Civil Service Board of said islands, undor
such regulations as may be agreed upon by tha
said board and the said United States Civil
Service Commission," ~* Â» : :
CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.
The Civil Service Commission is greatly em
barrassed In its work for want of an adequate
permanent force for clerical and other assist
ance. Its needs are fully set forth In Its re
port. I invite attention to the report, and
especially urge upon the Congress that this im
portant bureau of the public service, which
passes upon the qualifications and character
of so large a number of officers and employes
of the Government, should be supported by Ml
needed appropriations to secure promptness and
efficiency.
I am very much lmoressed with the state
ment made by the head* ot all departments of
the urgent necessity of a hall of public records.
In every departmental building In Washing
ton, so far as I am informed, the space for
official records is not only exhausted, but th-i
walls of rooms are lined with shelves, the
middle floor space of many rooms is filled with
file cases, and garrets and basements which
were never Intended and are unfitted for their
accommodation are crowded with them. Aside
from the Inconvenience there is great danger
not only from fire but from the weight of these
records upon timbers not intended for their
support. There should bÂ«- a separate bulldln*
especially designed for the purpose of receiv
ing and preserving the annually accumulating
archleves of the several executive departments
Such a hall need not be a costly structure, but
should be so arranged as to admit of enlarge
ment ' from time to time. I urgently recom
mend that the Congress take early action In
this matter.
I transmit to the Congress a resolution
adopted at a recent meeting of the American
Bar Association concerning the proposed cele
bration of John Marshall day, February 4 1301
Fitting exercises have been arranged, and it Is
earnestly desired by the committee - that the
Congress may participate In this movement to

the Senate and House of Representatives In the

Executive Mansion. December 4 1900.
Very efficient service has been rendered by
the nary in connection with the Insurrection In
the Philippines and- the recent disturbance la
China.
A very satisfactory settlement has been made
of the long pending: question of the manufac
ture of armor plates. A reasonable price has
been secured and the necessity for a Govern
ment armor. slant avoided.
I approve of the recommendations of the Sec
retary of the Navy for new vessels and for ad
ditional officers and men, which the required
increase of the navy makes necessary.
I commend to the favorable action of the
Congress the measure now pending for the
erection of a statue to the memory Of the late
David D. Porter. I commend also the establish
ment of a" national navy reserve and of the
grade of vice admiral. Provisions should bÂ«
made, as recommended by the Secretary, for
suitable rewards for special merit. Many offi
cers who rendered the most distinguished, serv
ice during the recent war with Spain have re
ceived in return no recognition from the Con
gress.
The total area of public land, as given by
the Secretary of the Interior, Is approximately
1,071,881,662 acres, of which 917.935,880 acres are
undisposed of and 154,745,782 acres have been
reserved for various purposes. The public lands
disposed of durlne the year amount to 13.433,
887.06 acres, including â¬2.423.09 acres of Indian
lands, an Increase of 4,271,474.80 over the preced
ing year. The total receipts from the sale of
public lands during the fiscal year were $4,379,
758 10, an increase of 11,809,620 76 over the pre
ceding year.
The results obtained from our forest policy
have demonstrated Its wisdom and the neces
sity in the interest of the public for its contin
uance and increased appropriations by the Con
gress for the carrying on of the work. On Jure
30, 1900, there were thirty-seven forest reserves,
created by Presidential proclamations under
section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, embracing
an area of 46,425,129 acres.
During the past year the Olympic reserve. In
the State of "Washington, was reduced 265,040
acres, leaving its present area at 1,923,840 acres.
The Prescott reserve in Arizona was increased
from 10,240 acres to 423,680 acres, and the Big
Horn reserve. In "Wyoming, was increased from
1,127,690 acres to 1,180,800 acres. A new reserve,
the Santa Ynez, In California, embracing an
area of 145.000 acres, was created during this
year. On October 10, 1900. the Crow Creek for
est reserve. In Wyoming, was created, with an
area of 56.330 acres.
INCBEASE OF PENSION BOLL.
At the end of the fiscal year there were on
the pension roll 993,225 names, a net increase
of 2010 over the fiscal year 1899. The number
added to the rolls during the year was 45,344.
The amount disbursed for army pensions dur
ing this year was $134,700,594 24 and for navy
pensions $3,761,033 41, a total of $138,462,130 65,
leaving an unexpended balance of I5.S12.76S 25
to be conveyed Into the treasury, which shows
an Increase over the previous year's expenditure
of $107,077 70. There were 684 names added to
the rolls during the year by special acts passed
at the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress.
The act of May, 1900, among other things,
provides for an extension of income to widows
pensioned under said act to $250 per annum.
The Secretary of the Interior believes that by
the operations of this act the number of per
sons pensioned under it will increase and the
increased annual payment for pensions will be
between $3,000,000 and $4.00O.0C0.
The Government Justly appreciates the serv
ices of its soldiers and sailors by making pen
sion payments liberal beyond precedent to the
men, their widows and orphans.
There were 26,540 letters patent granted. In
cluding reissues and designs, during the fiscal
year ended June 30, ibw, 18G0 trademarks, 6S2
Ubf'Is and ninety-three prints registered.
The number of patents which expired was
19.98S. The total receipts for patents were 11.
3IS.228 35. The expenditures were $1,247,527 68.
showing a surplus of $110,400 77.
The attention of Congress is called to the
report of the Secretary of the Interior touch
ing the necessity for the further establishment
of schools In the Territory of Alaska and favor
able action is Invited thereon.
Much interesting information is given in the
report of the Governor of Hawaii as to the
progress and developments of- the islands dur
ing, the period from July 7, 1893, the date of
the approval of the Joint resolution of Con
gress providing for their annexation, up to
April 80, 1900. the date of the approval of the
act providing a government for the territory
and thereafter.
The last Hawaiian census, taken in the year
1S96, gives a total population of 1C9.020, of
which 31,019 were native Hawaiian*. The num_
ber of Americans reported was 84S5. The re
sults of the Federal census taken this year
show the islands to have a total population of
1E4.001, showing an increase over that reported
In 1S36 of 44.9S1 or 41.2 per cent.
There has been marked progress In the edu
cational, agricultural and railroad development
of the Islands. *
In the territorial act of April 30, 1900. section
7 of said act repeats chapter 34 of the civil
laws of Hawaii, whereby the Government was
to assist in encouraging and developing the
agricultural resources of the republic, especial
ly irrigation. The Governor of Hawaii recom
mends legislation looking to the " development
of such water supply as may exist on the
public lands, with a view of promoting land
settlement. The earnest consideration of Con
gress Is Invited to this Important recommenda
tion and others, as embodied in the report of
the Secretary of the Interior.
The director of the census states that the
work In connection with the twelfth census Is
progressing favorably. This national under
taking, ordered by Congress each decade, has
finally resulted in the collection of an aggre
gation of statistical facts to determine the In
dustrial growth of the country, its manufactur
ing and mechanical resources. Its richness in
mines and forests, the numbers of Us agri
cultural districts, their farms and products.
Its educational and religious opportunities, as
well as questions pertaining to sociological
conditions.
COMPLETING THE CENSUS.
The labors of the officials in charge of the
bureau Indicate that the law of March 3, 1S99,
requiring the completion of the four important
and most desired subjects, namely, population,
agricultural, manufacturing and vital statis
tics, will be completed within the prescribed
limit.
The field work incident to the abovÂ» in
quiries is now practically finished and as a
result the population of the States and Ter
ritories including the Hawaiian Islands and
Alaska has been announced. The growth of
population during the last decade amounts to
over 13.C00.000, a greater numerical increase
than in any previous census in the history of
the country.
Bulletins will be Issued as rapidly as possible,
giving the population by States and Territor
ies,- by minor civil divisions. Several announce
ments of this kind have already been adopted
and it is hoped that the list will be completed
by January 1. Other bulletins giving the re
sults of the manufacturing and agricultural
inquiries wlli be given to the public as rapidly
an circumstances will admit.
The director, while confident of his ability
to complete the different branches of the under
taking in the allotted time, finds himself em
barrassed by the lack of a trained force prop
erly equipped for statistical work, thus rais
ing the question whether in the interest of
economy and a thorough execution of the census
work there should not be retained In thÂ» Gov
ernment employ a certain number of experts,
not only to aid In the preliminary organiza
tion prior to the taking of the decennial census,
but In addition to having the advantage in the
field and office work of the bureau of trained
assistants to facilitate the early completion of
this enormous undertaking.
I recommend that Congress at its present ses
sion apportion representation among the sev
eral States as provided by the constitution.
The Department of Agriculture has been ex
tending its work during the past year, reaching
farther for new varieties of seeds and plants;
co-operating more fully with the States and
Territories in research along useful lines; mak
ing progress in meteorological work relating to
lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for
ocean-going vessels; continuing Inquiry as to
animal disease: looking Into the extent and
character of food adulteration; outlining plans !
for the care, preservation . and intelligent har
vesting'of our wood lands; studying soils that
producers may cultivate with better knowledge
of conditions, and hoping to clothe desert
places with grasses suitable to our arid re
gions. Our Island possessions are being con
sidered, that their peoples may be helped to
produce the tropical products -now so exten
sively brought Into the United States. Inquiry
into methods of Improving our roads has been
active during the year; help has been given to
many localities and scientific Investigations of

Judge William T. Wallace was In a rem
iniscent mood when he took the stand in
Judge Seawell's court yesterday morning
to press his claim against Drury Melone
for legal services rendered since 18S0 in
the matter of the recovery on bonds is
sued by the city of Placerville. The ac
quaintance of the plaintiff and the de
fendant was the first subject of inquiry,
and in response to the questions of coun
sel Judge Wallace, said:
"I met Mr. Melone in San Jose in 1853,
and for nearly a half-century we were in
timate friends. He was a very active" man,
and his activity often furnished me with
opportunities to advise him regarding va
rious deals In which he became interested,
but I never charged him for these'ser
vices. * ' '
"In the year of 18S0, as near as I can re
member, we became Interested in the is
suance of bonds by the city of Placerville,
A bond issue of 1100.000 was made and
placed upon the market, the funds so ob
tained being for the purpose of construct
ing a railroad through that city. After
the bonds were issued the city refused to
take them up, and it was not until 1889
that a settlement could be obtained. Mr.
Melone then obtained $36,150 25. An agree
ment had been made between us to the
effect that for my services I was to have
one-half of any sum received by him. He
neglected to tell me, however, that he had
compromised with the city of Placerville
and had secured the sum named.
"When I heard that he had finally re
covered on the bonds I demanded my
share, but he refused to even listen to my
demands tor some time. He asked me if
It was not a fact that a written agreement
had been made between us to the effect
that I was to have 20 per cent of his
profits. I assured him that he was in er
ror; that the agreement between us was
oral and to the effect that I was to re
ceive one-half of his entire income from

Judge Wallace then testified at length
concerning the suit brought against the
city of Placerville to recover on the bonds,
In which judgment was recovered In Sep
tember of 1S81.
Ryland B. Wallace was next placed on
the stand. He testified in substance as
did Judge Wallace. For many years, he
said, he acted as counsel for Mr. Melone,
and among other duties he was forced to
keep a watchful eye on the Legislature
to prevent the enactment of a general law
which would prevent collection of the
Judgment.
This was the only mention made of the
Legislature during the day's proceedings.
Matters promise to grow more Interesting
when the hearing of Melone's cross-com
plaint is taken up. for Melone claims that
his services In keeping the Legislature In
line and maintaining a lobby are worth
a sum much greater than that demanded
by the plaintiffs, and for which he de
mands Judgment.

TOPICS ARE NAMED FOR
THE WATER CONVENTION
Proposed Legislative and Congres
sional Programme Is Mapped
Out in Detail.
Tn a call sent out from thV headquarters
'of the California "Water and Forest Asso
ciation for "the second annual convention,
to be held In this city In the Maple room
of the Palace Hotel, on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday of next week. President
Thomas enumerates the resolutions and
propositions that have already been of
fered for discussion. These embrace the
legislative and Congressional programme.
They are as follows:
Requesting Congress to appropriate $250,000
for the work of the geological survey and
$100,000 for the work of the irrigation Inves
tigations of the Department of Agriculture
during the year 1901; requesting the Secretary
of the Interior to set aside $30^000 for the work
of the geological survey In California, and
requesting the Secretary of Agriculture to set
npide $20,0C0 for the work of the Irrigation In
vestigations In California during the year 1901;
requesting Congress to reserve all unsold pub
lic forest lands within the State, to establish
a more efficient forest patrol and to adopt a
national policy of scientific ' forestry; to en
courage the preservation of second growth tim
ber,, to perintt the purchase by the State of
"cut-over" forest lands and to provide more
fitringent penalties against forest and brush
fires: the advisability of an appropriation by
the Btate of the sum of SGO.OOO to be expended
during 1901 and 1902 In collaboration with the
United States geological survey and of the
sum of $30,000 to be expended during the same
I-erlod In collaboration with the Irrigation In
vestigations of the Department of Agriculture;
the creation of a. special tribunal to finally
adjudicate all conflicting water rights and
make same a matter of record; proposition for
authorizing Irrigation districts to compound
their existing Indebtedness; plans for the con
servation of flood waters and for the publics
control of the distribution of water In accord
ance with .vested rights will probably bÂ« dis
cussed, but have not as yet been presented to
the oflicers of the association In definite form.
Usual Friction Is Caused
by the Lack of
Stenographers.
POLICE JUDGES
AGAIN QUARREL
The Police Judges are once more quar
reling over stenographers and the Mayor
will perhaps have to be called on again
to act as arbiter. Howard Vernon, one of
the reporters, has been confined to his
bed with pneumonia for the last week,
and, as a result, the other two have had
more work than they could attend to.
Yesterday morning Judge Cabaniss had
two felony examinations and no stenog
rapher. He pent his bailiff, Fleming, to
Judge Conlan with a request for the ser
vices of Reporter Frank Vernon. Con
lan told Vernon to remain; as felony cases
were coming up In his court, too.
Cabaniss then had his two cases trans
ferred to Conlan's court by Presiding
Judge Fritz. Fleming left the* transfer
order with Clerk Rice and placed the pris
oners in Conlan's dock.
Conlan said he would not recognize the
transfer and Fleming took the prisoners
back to Cabaniss. The last named Judge
ordered them back to Conlan's care, but
Bailiff Lawes. acting under the Judge's
Instructions, locked his dock and refused
to take them.
Back went the men to Cabaniss In
Fleming's care. This Judge continued
the cases until Friday, remanding the
prisoners to the City Prison, and then is
sued orders to Frank Vernon to appear In
his court every afternoon at 2 o'clock, ex
cepting on Sundays and holidays. " '
The war of the Police Judges has only
begun and before it is over a* stirring
chapter may be added to the city's his

The result of the Inquiry, so far as It
has gone, shows a general mlx-yp of au
thority, due to the endeavor to reconcile
the laws of the National Guard to thÂ«
nÂ«eds of a naval force, a division of finan
cial responsibility, and a dissatisfaction
over the location of the Marlon, the train-
Ing ship. It was suggested that she be
brought alongside of some wharf Instead
of being anchored out in the stream, os
the division officer declared that much
of the absence from drills Is caused by
the difficulty of going to and from tho

PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS
TO BE HELD IN TRUST
Supreme Court Decides That Son of
Brave Fireman Must "Walt for
His Money.
Thomas E. Hallinan, a son of the brave
fireman who lost his life some years ago
while in the performance of his duty, will
not receive his share of the fund sub
scribed for him by a generous public until
he reaches his majority. The Supreme
Court yesterday affirmed the Judgment of
the lower court in his suit to compel W.
R. Hearst to pay the money over to him.
The decision recalls the untimely deaths
of Timothy Hallinan, John Moholy and
Frank Keller, who were killed by the
falilnp of a wall in the conflagration that
destroyed the property of the Standard
Biscuit Company on ]Â¦ olsom street. The
public sympathized with the families .of
the dead heroes, and when W. R. Hearst
started a subscription by donating $200
the people added their contributions and
the fund reached S5905 25.
Before paying this pum to the relatives
the Examiners proprietor asked the ad
vice of three prominent citizens and they
suggested that a third of the sum col
'ect^d should be divided between the
young lady who was engaged to marry
Keller and hi* sisters, but as the children
of Moholy and Hallinan were minors ad
vised him to hold the money in trust until
they became of age. Acting on their ad
vice, Mr. Hearst declined to turn the
money over. Suit was brought by young
Hallinan through his guardian, Edward
J. L.inde Jr.. to compel Mr. Hearst to pay
over his share of the money contributed.
Mr.- Hearst was successful In the Supe
rior Court and an appeal was taken to
the Supreme Court. "
In affirming the Judgment of the lower
court Judge McFarland, who wrote the
opinion, said that when money was con
tributed In this way and no definite con
tract was made the contributors must
rely on not only the integrity but the good
Judgment and wise discretion of the per-
Bon or persons to whom the money was
given.

such a terrible nature that from the first
he was marked for death, and although
every effort was made to save him his
condition precluded all possibility of his
recovery. His skull was fractured and
he sustained severe internal injuries. An
operation to relieve his condition- was

DEATH RECORD IS
NOW TWENTY-TWO
Judge Edward A. Belcher of the Su
pcrlcr Court handed down an opinion yf s
ttrday edjudgingr unconstitutional that
section of the Code of Civil Procedure
vesting cct-rts with authority to declare
the rank of a lien or class of liens upon
properties upon which the claimants have
bet lowed labor or furnished inatetial.
The court, in an opinion, handed down in
the consolidated mechanics' lien case of
<\ A. Hooper against L. N. Fletcher and
Frank OlnuY against L. N. Fletcher atÂ»d
Kenry SInuu-. not only holds' that the
matter of preferment of claims Is abhor
rent to the spirit of our laws, but in the
cati! at bar r.uch preferment is unconsti
tutional and void. The opinion says:
By section 1194, Code_pf Civil Procedure, It is
provided that "in every case in which different
liens fite asserted against any propÂ«rty. thfc
court In the judgment must declare the rank
of each lien, or class of liens, which shall be
in the following order:
"1. All persons performing manual labor In,
on or about the. same;
"2. Persons furnishing materials;
"i. Subcontractors;
"4. Original contractors.
"And the prociedn of the sale of the property
must be applied to each Iten or class of liens
In the order of its rank; and whenever. In the
Â¦ale of the property subject to the lien, there Is
a deficiency of proceeds, Judgment may be
docketed for the deficiency in like manner and
with like effect as in actions for the foreclosure
of mortgage*."
In this cont-olidated case the first and second
classes would take all of the fund, leaving
nothing for the third and fourth class if the
statute must be followed. Certain of the lien
claimants 1 contended that the section Is uncon
stitutional, and in my estimation that conten
, tion is sound.
The constitution provides that: "Mechanics,
; material men, artisans and laborers of every
class shall have a lien upon the property upon
which they have beetov.ed labor or. furnished
materials, for the value of such labor done and
materials furnished, and the Legislature shill
provide by law for the siÂ«?edy and efficient en
forcement of all such Hens."
By this constitutional provision a direct lieu
is given to mechanics, materiel men, artisans
and laborers, and nothing is left to the legis
lature, save the duty of enacting measures for
the enforcement ...f the liens given. The Legis
lature was not authorized to declare which oC
these claeÂ«ps to the exclusion of the others
ehould bo paid. To the contrary, th.* Legisla
ture was given power, or rather it was direct
ed, to provide by law for the "speedy and ade
quate enforcement" of the Hens already given.
Bv the constitution the liens of all the classes
mentioned Etar.d upon the same plansâ are
equal before the law, and the Leglelature had
no power to enact that one class should be paid
in preference to another. .
The constitutional protection Is extended to
"mechanics, material men, artisans and la
borers of every class." These protected clashes
do not embrace contractors or subcontractor*.
A contractor or mbcontractor might chance to
be skilied in the practice of some mechanical
art. but his contract or subcontract would not
necessarily call for the display of mechanical
ability, and therefore I do not see how either
could be said to be embraced within the de
nomination "mechanic." Certainly they are
not embraced within either of the other three
classes. â¢
A corporation might be a contractor or a sub
contractor, but. clearly, a corporation, in this
particular, is not within the constitutional in
tendment. ' In my judgment, therefore, the
Hens of contractors and subcontractors must
depend iyx>n the force and effect of the gen
eral law. All of the lien claimants proved
their claims, or they were admitted, and they
are to be-treated with perfect equality. Henry
Bimas. the owner, did not interplead as he
might have done, but brought the amount of
the final payment into court after he had been
served with summons. At the most that wan
but a part performance, as he was liable to
the contractor for Interest, and the contractor
having defaulted and the fund being inade
quate, the lien claimants were entitled to all
that the contractor would become entitled to.
At the trial, however, the owner appeared, and
notwithstanding that the contractor had de
faultedâthus, in effect, admitting the legality
of the claims of Henâ took an active part In the
trial In residing the claims of certain of the
claimants. In my opinion he should be held
IlaMe for costs and counsel fÂ»>es. In addition to
interest on the final payment, payable out of
the proceeds of the property. Let a decree fore
closinp the liens of thÂ» various claimants and
directing a sale of the property for the satis
faction of the sum* found due be drawn In ac
cordance with the views here expressed.
Ji.dfie I*c*cllti's opinion, if sustained by
thiÂ» Knpreine Court; will effect a ravolu

SANTA FE DEMTTHS
i IN LOS ANGELES CASE
Contention Will- Be Argued Before
the State Railroad Commission
Â¦ Next Tuesday.
The Santa Fe Company filed with the
State Railroad Commissioners yesterday,
its demurrer in the case of the Los An-
Keles Traffic Association against the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe companies
for alleged discrimination in freight rates.
A hearing on the demurrer is to be held
next Tuesday at 10 a. m. before the com
missioners. The Santa Fe's demurrer la
as follows:
Firstâ The entire complaint of the LoÂ« Ange
les TraKic Association Is based upon a dis
crimination growing' out of the fact that Los
Angeles Is nearer to the points named In the
complaint than San Franclnco, yet that San
Francisco on the various classifications la given
the lesser late. The schedule attached to the
complaint showing the classification of rates
and mileage is a schedule bas*d on the mile
age of the Southern Pacific and not on the
mileage of the Southern California, the Santa
Fe Pacific and the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley roads, and, therefore, the com
plaint does not state a cause of action, on the
theory upon which It Is- framed, as against the
roads last mentioned.
Secondâ This board can take judicial notice
of the fact that of the points named in the
complaint the Santa Fe lines only touch at
BakersSeld. Tulare. Vlsalla. Hanford and
Fresno, and that, by the Santa Fe lines, Los
Angeles Is only about thirty miles nearer to
Bakersfield than San Francisco, while Tulare
is 101 miles farther from Los Angeles than It
la from San . Francisco ; Visalla Is 123 miles
farther from Los Angeles than it Is from San
Francisco; Hanford Is 151 miles farther and
Fresno Is 191 miles farther.
Thirdâ The entire complaint must fail, so
far as the Santa Fe lines are concerned, when
the mileage on such line* to the points men
tioned which are reached by the Santa Fe
lines Is taken Into consideration as the basis
of making freight rates.
Alfred Bouvier says San. Francisco U
to have a new opera-house in keeping
with the city's importance. He stated
yesterday that the building would be
erected on Eddy street, near Taylor, on
ground that is owned by Mayor Phelani
The company, though not* yet incorpor
ated, will be composed of five members.
Including Mayor Phelan and himself. The
cost of- the building will be more -than
$250,000. It will be a. modern â¢ theater In
every respect. . It will be known as the
"San Francisco Opera-house." Bouvier
explained yesterday that the plans of the
new house . will not be much different
from those of opera-houses now in exist
ence, but that the view of the audience
would be better and the classification of
seats different.- 1 He stated that the new
opera-house- would be so elaborate that
it would practically stop any. other cap
italist from embarking in the same sort
of venture for several years.
Bouvier has been working: on the
scheme for a long time and feels that
his hopes are at last realized. He claims
that, the ground will be broken in less
than six weeks. Â»Â¦ .
Mayor Phelan wa3 seen and stated that
he had been approached by Alfred Bou
vler, who was anxious to buy his prop
erty on Eddy street for an opera-house.
The Mayor said that he was quite willing
to sell the property and that he might
possibly be a stockholder In the new ven
ture.

GRAPE-NUTS.
DONT NEED REST.
Starved Nerves Need Food.
Â¦ .- A food lhat will naturally stimulate and
! nourish a man no weak that he cannot
icocj himself murt have intrinsic merit
â¢jBfld be worthy ihe attention of any person
'with a wrak Ftomarh. S. D. Horine of
â¢JrinneM. Iowa, writes: "By pure food
Kpemi to me the true way to pet well. Aft-
er a lone time atone of the best equipped
ranitariums, without benefit, I was put
binder a famous doctor, who said that I
Â¦ djd not ne<>d rest eo much as I needed
rich, pure blood, made from pure food,
'and I was put on Grape-Nutn.
"At that time I had to be lifted from my
bed like a baby. This was only a few
vÂ«*kÂ» ago. Now I can walk, read, write
Vnd: perform many little tasks. I have not
fully recovered my strength by any means,
; ; l;Ut I have made a most wonderful pro-
yi-eeu on Grape-XuiK food. It leads me to
Vh* knowledge that nervous prostration is
filmply nerve starvation. The nerves are
prostrated because they are starved. A
starved man does not reed rest, but he
Â¦reeds food.
*To be sure, the famished nerves are
forced to rest, but rest cannot restore
Â¦them. They can build up on food alone.
With my first meal of Grape-Nuts food I
:-tt,mm too weak to feed rnyrelf, but after
.partaking of the food a hopeful spirit,
almost amounting to buoyancy, possessed
.'me.
.' "I can account for the speedy effect of
:?He food on no other ground than that It
U soÂ«as4Jy digested that only a little time
:â¢:}& force Is required to prepare It for the
blood, whereat* ordinary food requires so
rraucti force to direst it that it exhausts
strength r. weak man has and leaves
â¢n> food undigested, ready for deromposl-
: ticn, and chances what ehould be good
food into a veritable poison. EaÂ«y diges-
'ion and rapid assimilation make Grape-
Nuta the ideal food for any one."

Chicago Livestock Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.-CATTLE-EÂ»"^-Â»*- Â«â¢
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.â Wheat was firm and
fairly active. January opened %c3%c over
Saturday at 70$i5I71c under the influence of an
advance at Liverpool, world's shipments, 2,000,
000 bushels less than estimated, the amount
being only 5.E65.C00 bushels, and a decrease of
360,000 bushels on passage, Commission houses
and shorts were buyers. The heavy Northwest
receipts caused Bollins during the forenoon and
January reacted to 7C!ic. Offerings were well
taken, however, and no further decline took
place. Later the visible decrease of 82,000
bubhels. Snow's estimate reducing the Argen
tine exportable surplus to 37,000,000 bushels,
and reports cf export Inquiries at New York,
where the market showed considerable strength,
resulted in a rally to Vl'.ic for i January. On
the bulge trade became dull and on profit-tak
ing January reacted to 70%c, but closed firm,
>^c higher at 70%Â®71c.
Corn was firm and in moderate demand, and a
fair improvement ln price. Country offerings
were small and the weather threatened to
curtail the movement from first hands still
further. January closed strong %c up at 36%
fipJSHc.
The oats market was fairly active during
the first hour, but prices were on the down
grade. May closed U<3'VtC higher at 23Q"233ic
Provisions were dull. The opening was eas
ier on more hogs than expected. The crowa
bought a little early because a leading bull
operator was dolns so. but the purchases were
let out again later. January pork closed 2Vic
lower ind lard and ribs a shade higher.

Dried Fruit in AVti 1 York.
Mail edvices from New York say: "An In
tr-r*-fUr.p feature of th? dried fruit market is
the improving consumptive demand for cur
rants. Prices seem tr. have reached a level at
which the trade Is dispose-d to take hold more
liberally. j>articu:arly as the statistical posi'lion
c : ihÂ»- world's caxtmat markets is very strong,
end there may be a return to a higher range
DC values lxÂ»fore many months. Sales of cur
rants jest.-rday were of a very good volume,
the re-;* rted business being the largest for
Â¦ me time.
â¢'Pate; continue strcrig- and in good demand.
Prunes are rather quieter. Elzes 60-T0a are
Brarf-e and are wanted. There Is a good de
mand for fancy raislr.s for the holiday trade.
KfeiJed also are ir. fair request, but otherwise
raisins are <iu!l and easy. Peaches, apricots,
l*s.rs, etc.. are Â«U)w. Evaporated apples are
easier, the bottom having dropped from the
market temporarily at least, now that short*
have largely covered. Prime spot goods are
quoted row at lÂ®y-+?. A car of s'tghtly under
l.rin.e was offered yesterday at 4Vjc.
"In nuts interest continues to center ln wal
nuts. New Grenobles are practically not to be
found and Naples arÂ» higher and in only light
tupply. Sicily filberts are firm at I'.Hc and
Er? selling very freely. Some Interest Is taken
in almonds et the lower prices."

NEW YORK. E*"\ 2 âSpeculative activity
i-or.Unued rathr-r depressing In stocks to-day.
Kus-ir.c-K? was on a diminishing scale, and
lacked even the isolated features of great
activity and strength which cave lt character
on diftmnt <iays las-t woek. when the tendency
to contract dfulinsK was already manifest. The
opening of Congress iicj the presentation of

â¢ 'lltion to njj'-i'Iy motives for moving prices
: but it can hardly Ue *aid that any general ln

Â¦{Visslonal traders to t-ffr-ct eome movement in
tie fctctl stocks. That is to say. alarmist ru
. more wen <-urreni before its ap;>earance on
the rtsnd takÂ«:n on thf â¢â¢trust" question. The
. rtocks proved vulnerable to the bear attack
erd the decline brought out considerable of
' fpring." cf long stock, effecting a decline at one
time in Tenn'-pFf-e Coal of 4Â»i and in Hteel and
Wire of S'i- These were, the weakest stocks
. nnd they rallied on short covering 1% and
. IVi respectively. On the oth^r hand Sugar
was fairly buoyant, rising at one time 2Â»i,
. ar.d closing v.-J-h a net gain of 2*; per cent!
Jn the outi-lde market also Standard Oil sold
. at 8:0. leaving all previous records far behind
lt. The u;>\vard rush of over 6 points in Pa
cific Mall Â¦n-a.s made at the oj^ning, anÂ«l was
prompted by the general concurrence in the
â¢^cws reported from the party loaders in
Washington as to the prominent place given
by the ship subsidy bill in the party pro-
Frainrr.e for the Kesslon. There was quite a
Fhort Interest, v/hlch emphasized the result.
The Ban;Â«- was true of Supar, which recovered
Its Saturday loss with the anjroach of the
dividend nv-etinp. The dividend meeting.
! < -i < r. -wfcÂ« â¢,<â¢.-â¢. jMinÂ«"i from to-day and the
rtock became quirt. The railroad IlFt was Â«
trembly Irropular. B. fc O. xuffei-ed sharply
â¢ on ectount of th<- IrpaJ proccodinps to enjoin
thn payment of tho dividtn<l oa the common
Hoi. pending the decision of the right* of the
f referred etock to share equally with the coro
n.on Itoek in rjlvi-iends over 4 p*r cent. There
were also conspicuous Ftocks in the railroad
31ft which paim-d sharply, including Pennsyl
vania as the leader. The fact wa* that neither
the ralr.s nor the losres Bhowed ihe profes-
Rional â¢Â¦haracrter of tbe dealings. Notwlth
Â¦ FtamJinsr the reduced activity, there wan a
" Fharii hardr-nlnir in the commercial money
rate to â¬ i>r-r cr-nt late in the day. aY which
figvr* lt nqulrrd a million dollar* to meet tho
needs of bc'ated boiTower*, who had held out
â¢ for better terms. This served to emphajsize
the rffeot of the back statement, but never
theless It is common belief that the Important
features of the statement were due to the
temporary provision f O r tbe December 1 pay-
1 ments, the trust companies calling loans for
that purpose, the borrowers resorting to the
banks, while the trust companies also increas
ed their cash deposits with the banks ln order
to draw on them. It is believed the disburse
ment oT December dividends will soon come
back to the market, but the renewed large
demand for currency from the interior is very
Important. Â¦
The absorption of bonds continues large and
important, and prices are generally higher.
Special features were Chicago and Alton 3Vis,
Kings County Elevated 4s and the 4 per cent
lssurs of Norfolk and Western, Union Paciflc, I

Charges That Business of Equity
Building and Loan Association
Has Been Mismanaged.
OAKLAND. Dec. 3.â Mrs. Louisa Corn
stock, who failed in an action to recover
$3800 against the Equity Building and
Loan Association, filed a suit In interven
tion against the defunct corporation to
day. The suit is similar to the one re
cently brought by Attorney General Ford
to enjoin the building and loan associa
tion from continuing its business and ask
ing that a receiver be appointed to take
charge of the assets and liabilities.
Mrs. Comstock's complaint recites that
the corporation has been seriously mis
managed: that it has not had a treasurer
for a year past; that there was favorit
ism toward several creditors, and that
the directors have loaned money from the
association's funds to themselves upon se
curity insufficient to insure the recovery
of it.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec 8.
City Councilman Frank K. Mott has
leaped into the ring of municipal turmoil.
Mr. Mott cays flatly that the time of the
Mayor, the City Attorney and the City
Engineer should not be taken up with
place hunters, but with their legitimate
duties, and he wants the charter amend
ments carried to avoid this trouble in the
future, Mr. Mott says:
The present city charter method of constitu
ting the Board of Public Works has proven to
be unsatisfactory after nearly six yean of
trial, and I desire to call attention to iomÂ«
speciflo details relating to the situation In
municipal affairs, which may have escaped
general observation or "not have been closely
studied and understood by our citizens.
First let me repeat, however, that proposed
amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, to be voted upon
at the speoial election next Saturday, are de
signed to divorce from the present duties of
the Mayor, City Attorney and City Engineer
their control of the patronage departments of
the city government; 1. e., the Police and Fire
departments, and to (among other things) es
tablish a commission, diFtlnct and separate
from all others, which shall In future wholly
direct those two departments. Also to re
habilitate the Board of Public Works a* purely
as the executive arm of the City Council, thus
restoring to the board the functions designed
for It by the freeholders' who formulated our
charter, with this exception: That the Board
of Public Works shall no longer be hampered
in its duties by having to constantly wrestle
with the subject of "patronage" or "spoils."
Let me ask the voters of Oakland: Do they
desire a Mayor who shall have time to attend
to the many duties of the chief executive of
the city, as provided In the charter originally,
or do they desire a Mayor harassed by thÂ«*
increasing cries of the spoilsmen â his timÂ« oc
cupied In listening perhaps to the complaints
of rival cliques In this or that department; his
duties as executive officer necessarily neglected,
and his energies spent In fruitless attempts
to smooth the path to preferment of some
clamorous, petty place-seekerT
Is it not about time our city charter should
provide In terms that the Mayor should be the
city's chief executive, as originally designed
by the charter, and only that?
And are the citizens of Oakland desirous of
having the city's grave legal interests and dif
ficulties, present and prospective, constantly
Increasing In importance as they are, attended
to by the man they elect City Attorney, or do
they desire him to be handicapped eighteen
hours out of the twenty-four adjusting the
relative merits of two or more applicants for
a hosecart-drlver's Job or sitting In conference
night and day to decide whether some patrol
man was asleep "on watch" or not?
Is It not about time that Oakland should be
entitled to the legal services of whoever may
be her regularly elected City Attorney, and
not that she should require or permit him to
turn his attention from such needful legal
services ?
We have a large area now within- our city's
limits,, requiring the most earnest, constant
and careful consideration from an engineering
and sanitary standpoint. Do the people hope
for betterments in sanitation? Are not prob
lems of sewering paramount to the cries of
place-hunters? Have we not miles and miles
of ungraded streets, unlaid sidewalks, gutters
and curbs? Is it not about time that the city
of Oakland's engineer should have his whole
time and attention for the study of these im
portant sanitary questions and the kindred
engineering duties appertaining rightfully to
that office?
It seems to me that when the voters under
stand the purport of the proposed amendments
which are designed to srlve the future Mayors'
City Attorneys and City Engineers an oppor
tunity â¢ to transact their legitimate duties,
there will be practical unanimity in favor of
the adoption of amendments 1, 2, 3 and i. Let
the voters of Oakland then remove from the
shoulders of the three officials this patronage
burden, which sets like an "old man of the
sea," weighing down their energies, so that

ALLEGED SWINDLING
OF SOLDIERS REPORTED
Petty Merchants, Aided by Armv
Clerks, Said to Be Fleecing
Invalid Veterans.
Unscrupulous petty merchants, aided by
army clerks, are reported to be fleecing
Invalided soldiers who have money due
them. Several concerns are mentioned as
having employed solicitors to get Informa
tion and to prey upon the soldiers.
The basis of the operation is the official
record of each man, which, being pro
cured, gives information concerning the
coin the Government will pay him on a
certain day. With this knowledge those
who expect to realize from the unsophisti
cated soldiers know how much they can
safely trust each one. There Is a story
that they pay a regular price for the
facts. This is naturally added when the
soldier makes a purchase to the amount
charged against him.
The places thus alleged to be working
against the welfare of the soldiers and
no less against the welfare of the cJtv are
far out an Kearny street and near' the
Presidio. Men are induced to buy on cred
it, and their pay is all pledged before they
receive It. Reputable business houses are
protesting and declaring that something
must be done to prevent the outrages and
to preserve the good name of the city.

"While working at the desk he had occu
pied for twenty years Thomas L. Merrill,
receiving teller of the Contra Costa Water
Company, dropped dead ttys afternoon,
presumably from heart disease. He had
returned from lunch and had gone to his
desk only a minute before the summons
came so suddenly.
Mr. Merrill was working over his ac
counts when he suddenly clutched at his
heart, gave a moan of pain and sank to
the floor. He was borne quickly to the
president's office and Dr. Chamberlain,
who was driving by, was summoned. But
the aged clerk was dead before any relief
could be given to him.
As soon as the Coroner had been notified
and the fact made known that deceased
had long been suffering from heart trou
ble permission was given for the removal
of the body to the Merrill residence, at
1215 Brush street. Vice President Dingee
of the water company had relatives noti
fied and word was conveyed to the aged
widow, who had only a few minutes before
bade her husband good-by.
An Inquest will be necessary to deter
mine the cause of death, although there is
every evidence that heart disease was the
cause.
Mr. Merrill had resided in California for
many years, a score of which he had
spent in the water company's employ. He' 1
handled all of the receipts of the "office
from water rate payers during that time.
Deceased was 64 years of age. a native
of Maine. Besides his wife he leaves two
daughters, Mrs. Dr. Charles T. Rodolph
and Mrs. D. 8. Mathcs. The funeral ar
rangements will be made to-morrow.

conclusion.
Prince Chlrsg and Li Hung Chang both
fay that they are anxiously awaiting the

The missionaries and others who went
through the siege protest bitterly against

particularly that those who were high in
office and were responsible for the out

And they Insist also that a sufficient

LONDON. Dec. 3.â A St. Petersburg
special says: The population of Russia
was estimated at about "5,000.000 In 1S61.
the year of the emancipation of the s'erfs.
It is now calculated to be over 136,000,000,
according to a statement published by
the Ministry of Finance. This* estimate is
obtained by addingr the calculated annual
excess of births over deaths, which is cer
tainly 2,000.000 to the total of 129.0P0.OW
given by the census of January 2S. 1S97.
which was 126.400.000 without the Grand
L>uchy of Finland, or 129.000.003 Including:
Finland. The Slavonic population Is 73 per
cent of the whole. Russians alone num
bering S6,000,000. or G6 per cent, and the
Poles 9.000.000, or 7 per cent. The total
Finnish population Is over 6,000,000 and the
J.ithunians almost reach the same figure,
numbering 5,600.000. Various Turkish peo
pies of the Volga, the Crimea, the Cauca
sus and Siberia number 11,000,000, or about
9 per cent of the whole. There are 4,000,
000 Hebrews and about a million persons
of German descent or birth.
It has so long been the fashion to de
scribe the land of the Czar as "darkest
Russia," or "starving Russia," that most
people have difficulty in realizing that
there has bf-en any progress In the em
pire duting the last forty years except In
population. An observer who Is not preju
diced readily finds proof of the contrary.
One who has open eyes is fairly over
whelmed with evidences of a forward
movement along a thousand lines.
The present period is usually described
abroad as one of Industrial stagnation.
The word crisis is frequently met with in
foreign reviews of Russian business.
What are the facts? The production of
pig: iron, usually regarded as the barome
ter of commerce and industry, has been
thus far during 1&00 more than 12.000.u00
poods greater than curing the corre
sponding period of 1899. The Russian iron
producers, however, complain of dull
times because the increase this "year has
not been relatively as large as during the
preceding years. The Increase of pig iron
production in the northern district this
year was 2u0.000 poods, or 19.6 per cent; in
-he district of the Kurils 8,800.000 poods,
or over 10 per cent, and in the southern
district 5,900,000 poods, or 7 per cent.
The Ministry of Public Instruction has
ordered the establishment of new meteor
ological stations at all Important railway
stations in Siberia and upon the shores of
Lake Baikal."
The Ministry of Railroads and Commun
ications has appropriated for the coming
year 5,000,000 rubles for new chauszes,
principally in the Caucasus. The same
authority has ordered 1000 passenger cars
for the purpose of extending fourth-cla&s
service. The movement of worklngmen
upon the Russian railways last year
amounted to 3,000,000 persons.

the tailor says that it was all owing to

Mr. Thomas had an srrar.icement with

a brand-new, full-dress suit from his

could rush from home to the tailor's, get
his suit, take it to San Francisco, change

Everything worked well. He had the

rived at his hotel room In nice time. There
he prepared to change his costume and
opened his case. In it was an overcoat

IN HIS HURRY IMPRESARIO THOMAS
SEIZES THE WRONG DRESS-SUIT CASE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 3. -
Awaiting the final result of the wound
of Edward Conway, the woman who shot
him last night, in defense of her life, is
held at "the City Prison. There Is no
doubt in the minds of the Receiving Hos
pital surgeons that the wounded man will
recover. The bullet is supposed to be
lodged in his liver, but until the patient
has regained his strength no attempt will
be made to remove the missile.
A day since the shooting has developed
nothing to contradict Mrs. Susie Con
way's explanation of the reasons she fired
the shot at the man she insists is her
husband. But she will add hothlng more
now to the story of the domestic troubles
which caused the affair. She Is anxious
to gain her freedom, and to-day efforts
were made to induce Conway to have her
come to his bedside as a nurse. But the
wounded man refused to listen to the
proposition.
"I shall have nothing more to do with
her," he said this morning.
"While Conway has not specifically de
clared himself upon the subject, the gen
eral impression around police headquar
ters Is that, unles3 he shall succumb to
the Injury, there will be no prosecution
of Mrs. Conway. The woman was in
formed that Conway had denied her
claims of .marriage to him and she re
plied vigorously that she would compel
him to publicly retract his statement on
that score.
Lines have not fallen in pleasant places
for the attractive young woman since the
tioubles several years ago that caused a
separation between herself and voung

Fcion of the silver-tongued orator, she

East Oakland. In those days she was
remembered as Miss Susie Shaw, the
daughter of one of the prominent families
of the east side. They resided then at
Tubbs' Hotel, a society center, and there
was born the first child, the son of young
Thomas Fitch. After the separation Mrs.
Fitch went East and little was heard of
her. There were stories that she had
gone on the stage. Some two years ago
she met Conway, and they had been to
gether until the episode of last night.
They recently came here from Sacramen

at his trade of tailor's cutter, and he
claims to have well provided for Mrs
Conway and her son.

some woman, and.ln his hurry to take off
his hat to her Baumburger pulled a roll of
bills out of his pocket, and as hÂ© was
making a graceful bow several thousand

Into the bay. Baumburger forgot his lady

cured the pile. He received $2 for his
pains, and when the Zealandia sailed
away Baumburger was down In the en
gine-room drying out his cash.

The opening address was made by War

general way to the efforts of President
Kellogg and his associates for the lost
two years, callo'd on W. H. Jordan for a
few remarks. The paper read by Mr. Jor

many of the points discussed by leaders
of organized labor and capitalists, re
ferring principally to the conditions ex

on "The Economical Relations Between
Labor Unions and Trusts."
The next to give his opinions on the
subject was George W. Dickie of the

the relations existing between capital and

wonderful spectacle that greets his gaze
and imagines that some Aladdin has
rubbed his lamp and commanded that the
liarj walls should sparkle with myriad
Jewels and lights ana that grottoes filled
with interesting and strlKing tableaus
should bo produced in all their glowing

Fairyland is depicted as it has never
been before. The artist and the artisan
have skillfully transformed the floor into
a child's paradise. As you leave the ele
vator on tho second floor you ascend a
flight of winding steps and a beautiful
scene bursts upon you. The stairs are
carpeted in soft- material that glints and
resembles snow. Overhead are subdued
Incandescent lights that illumine the in

your gaze is riveted by "The Child's
Dream of Christmas." A flaxen-haired
maiden is calmly sleeping and her dream
is realized in the lifellKe iairy that is seen
descending golden steps. As .you' pass on

Edward Fennessey Is Accused of Be
lieving Aged Bert Asper of
Sixty Dollars.
Edward Fennessey, an oiler out of a Job,
who was arrested early yesterday morn-
ing by Policemen C. W. Brown and W.
Casey on a charge of robbery, appeared
before Judge Fritz yesterday.
Fennessey is accused of having robbed
Bert AEper. an aged watchman, who re-
Eldes at 2967 Twenty-sixth street. Asper
says he went Into O'Connor's saloon, at
Twenty-fifth and Florida streets, Sunday
night and bought several rounds of drinks
for Fennessey and some of his friends.
Asper left about 3 o'clock Sunday morn
ing, Fennessey having gone out ten min
utes before.
Asper says Fennessey attacked him out
side and after knocking him down took
$60, a knife and some keys from his pock
ets. He said to Asper when he knocked
him down: "If you shout for help I'll
shoot you." W. E. Eick of 1308 Florida
street heard his threatening remark.
Police Officers Brown and Casey caught
Fennessey late Sunday night. The offers
found that Fennessey had deposited ;55

Supervisor McCarthy presented a reso
lution at yesterday's meeting of the Su
pervisors directing the City Attorney to
bring suit against the Auditor and his
bondsmen to recover certain sums of
money alleged to have been illegally paid
by him to the Pacific States Telephone
Company. The money so paid Is on de
mands for telephones used by the city,
which McCarthy contends should not be
paid under the charter until the company
has paid to the city back license taxes on
its nickel machines amounting to over
$200,000. The resolution went over for one
week, and in the meantime the Auditor
will be cited to show cause why it should
not be adopted.

The Market Street Railway Company

in the afternoon and announced that he
had found the precious negatives. He
spent an hour on the stand during the
afternoon identifying his work, and
despite the time-honored objections made
by the defense the pictures were admit
ted.
George Russell, a policeman, identified
the diagrams.
The principal witnesses were Joseph
Donohue, a carpet-layer; William E.
Hayen, also a carpet-layer, and Miss S.
R. Blanchard, who rented the rooms at
803 Guerrero street to Mrs. Clute.
Miss Blanchard was shown the coupling
pin with which Mrs. Clute had been
beaten to death, and she said she had
never seen it around the house. She had
cleaned tho rooms just before she turned
them over to Mrs. Clute, and had there
been any such weapon in them she said
she would surely have seen It. She testi
fied that she rented the rooms to Mrs.
Clute on December 14. and she identified
a receipt for a month's rent dated De
cember 14. Miss Blanchard said she left
her house on December 14 and did not re
turn to it until the evening- of December
15, so she was away at the time Mrs. Clute
was killed.
The testimony of Hayen and Donohue
was nearly similar. They told how they
had come to the house to Jay carpets;
how they had laid one in the parlor,
where the coupling pin was afterward
found, and how they had seen no such I
article. Under cross-examination each
was asked If there was any use for such
an instrument In the business of a carpet
layer and both said they had no idea how
a carpet-layer could find use for such a
tool.
Mr. Deuprey made the opening state
ment for the people In the morning. He
told the jury the people would prove that
Mrs. Clute had been murdered with the
coupling pin, that the motivs was an un
natural one nnd that the defendant had
been traced from the scene of the crime
to the time of his arrest, and the people
would prove that he was the man who did
the deed.
Notes of Travel in Italy, Germany
and Netherlandsâ Pompeii and
Vesuvius â Day at the
Vatican.
James GIbb of San Francisco does not
belong to the ordinary type of tourists.
When he travels abroad he sees the
Eights, hears the talk and keeps, so to
speak, a log .of his Journeys. Seven
months ago, when his wife and daughter
told him that it would contribute to his
peace of mind and the span of his years
to loiter In the Netherlands, roam in Scot
land and take in England, Germany, Italy
and Switzerland, he accepted the sugges
tion in a spirit becoming a dutiful hus
band and progressive father.
Equipped with first-class credentials
Irom the State Department, Washington,
D. C, and reinforced by ample letters of
credit. Mr. Gibb set out for the Old "World
prepared to see and not afraid to be seen.
He has returned from his latest Journey
as he came from many previous excur
sions â with renewed enthusiasm for Cali
fornia in particular and the United States
in general.
W hat Mr. Gibb saw In Paris would make
a book, but he saw no fruit to be men
tioned in the same class with the pro
ducts of the California orchard. He can
not find praise 100 lavish to bestow on
Major lien Truman, Colonel \V. W. Koote
ana Colonel Varney Gaskill, representa
tives of California at the exposition.
Their hospitality was the joy of American
visitors. The apartments maintained
were central, accessible and ample. Tlie
Interpreter employed by the California
Commission retused to accept a tip for
explaining in detail the wonders of the
exposition. He readily assured Mr. Gibb
that the State paid for his services.
Of course, it must be understood that
the interpreter was employed by Califor
nia to guide and delight visitors who did
not speak the language of France in the
accents of the Parisian. The mistake must
not be made of supposing that Colonel
Foote and Colonel Gasklli need the as
sistance of an interpreter. Perhaps they
do not speak the language just as it
should be spoken to impart to the listener
the most delicate shade of meaning, but
the California gestures going with the
French articulations convey the entire
cense of meaning to the most obtuse Pa
risian. Major Truman acquired his mili
tary title and a knowledge of French long
before California appropriated 5130,000 for
exposition purposes, and therefore did not
have- to obtain either to enable him to
spend the mor.ey so generously appropri
ated by the-JLegislature.
Mr. Gibb found Holland a hive of In
dustry and a prosperous country. The
greatness of Germany in many respects
Impressed him, but he found England the
only country where the people appreciated
the magnitude and resources of tho
United States.
At Vesuvius Mr. Gibb did not loiter
around the foothills and look up, but went
to the top, with the aid of ropes at the
summit, and looked into the fog at tho
crater, getting a whiff of the fumes. In
the narrow streets of uncovered Pompeii
he took in the ordinary sights. Separat
ing himself from the throng, he went to
places in the old-time pleasure resort of
Rome where one cannot be admitted with
a lady or a camera.
The steamship Allen of the North Ger
man Lloyd line, bearing him from Naples
to New York, tarried six hours at Gibral
tar. Mr. Gibb was privileged to Inspect
the lower galleries of the impregnable
fortress, but was denied the opportunity
to pass Judgment on the high power ord
nanc* equipment of the upper tiers. On
tbe steamship an American army officer
and an officer of the British army sur
veyed the great rock. The former ex
pressed the hope that the fortress would
ever remain In British control. The lat
ter, responding, hoped that If it ever
passed from British possession tho Ameri
cans would get it.
The field of Waterloo was explored by
Mr. Gibb. The Scotch guide, who point
ed out all the points of great Interest,
observed the American flag in the but
ton worn by the tourist and took especial
care to explain the whole plan of cam
paign by Napoleon and the scheme of
resistance by . Wellington. When the
guide ascertained later on that Mr. Gibb
was an American born in Scotland lie
wanted to go over the battle-ground
again for love of country-
A day at the Vatican will linger long In
the memory of the observant tourist f ro/n
California. He saw che Pop* and was
i deeply impressed with the sacred gran
deur of the venerable man. He heard tho
acclaim of the populace and Baw the as
sembled pilgrims from the far-away
i Balkan States and Russia.
"I wedged In between two priests," eald
Mr. Gibb, "and was bo close to the Pope
Â¦ that I could have touched him had I been
j tall enough. I looked into the eyes of
i the aged Pontiff."
The scenes at the Vatican Impressed tho
tojirist with a sense of the Pope's vast.
Influence in this world.
Lingering at the Vatican the Callfornlan
tourist engaged in conversation with one
i of the keepers of the grounds. The keeper
i mentioned a rare piece of sculpture in tho
! renowned collectionâ a Venus of surpass
; ing grace and beauty. Mr. Gibb conveyed
j two francs to the kind keeper. Then came
the adoration.
The growth of -militarism In Great
i Britain did not escape the observa
i tion of the traveler. All the young men
' of the great nation were receiving lessons
j in the art of war. There is in the land
i a premonition of coming conflict. Tho
enemy may be FTance. perhaps Germany,
but all the English people hope that It
will not be the United States.
