NEW YORK. Nov. 4â Rev. Dr. Robert
B. MacArthur, pastor of Cavalry Bap

sentials to National Perpetuity and Spir
itual Prosperity." Alluding to the elec
tion. I>r. MacArthur said:
"Recently a candidate for the high of
fice of President and hi? chief lieutenant
have virtually incited the lawless ele
ment to rioting on election day. This ad
vice is the inspiration of the candidate,
and It is the utterance of his lieutenant.
The great body of voters Js law abiding,
hut there is an element in every commun
ity ready to take advantage of encour
agement and to violate wholesome â¢ law
Already there has been an outbreak of
violence alons the line traveled by this
verbose candidate. Speakers following
him have been Insulted and mobbed. This
candidate arcusos the passions of discon
tent and envy. Mob law at the polls is
the logical outcome of preaching the
tzne pel of hatred.
"A Senator who Is the titular head of
the candidate's party Indorses the ap-,
peal to riot uttered by the bellicose lieu
tenant in New York. Who Is this in
citer to riot? Where was he on November
,4, 1FT4. when 3n altercation took place at
the polls In this city? What relation did
he sustain to the man who was shot on
that occasion? Who wa? tried for mur
der then committed? Who was dis
charged because the Jury disagreed? Over
whose head still hangs the charge of mur
der?
"Dees this man Intend to return to fhs
practices of which he was master twenty-
Fix years ago? Is not this. threat of riot
ins a revival of the ruffianism of a quar
tr-r of a century ago? But this man is
too late for this form of political activ

added:
"Mr. Flint Is. the leading member of the

and is also connected with the Starch
Trust. He "has been the most conspicu
ous defender of the trust principle in the
United States, having made a speech at
Boston in May, 1899, and another at Chi
cago recently on that subject. I am glad
to have all trust magnates support the
Republican ticket, for, if I am elected,
they will not be visiting the White House
and asking favors in return for campaign
support. Our appeal is to the people who
Buffer from the trusts, not to the monopo
lists who profit by /them. Next to im
perialism and militarism, the trust ques
tion has done more than any other ques
tion to convince the plain people that the
Republican party is entirely given over to
the control of organized wealth. im

field. Democratic candidate for Governor
of New York, according to an intimate
political friend, is convinced that the Re
publicans will sweep the State on Tues
day.
Mr. Stanchfield's hopes have given way
to despair, according to one of the men
with whom he talked on Saturday night
while in this city. He and his friends
north of the Bronx estimated that they
would be able to keep tho Republican plu
rality up State down to 80,000. If the
counties south of the Bronx should give
the 100,000 Democratic plurality which
Croker promised the Democrats would
carry the State by 20,0u0 plurality.
While he was here Mr. Stanchfield
learned enough about the local situation
to become satisfied that the party plu
rality south of the Bronx would fall tens
of thousands short of what local lead
ers had been promising. This fact. His
friend said, convinced him that defeat
was inevitable, and that the Republicans
would carry the State by a large plural

Special Dispatch to The Call,

NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â Twenty-seven-
States, having 294 electoral votes, are
claimed for McKinley an'd Roosevelt In
the final estimate issued to-day by
the Republican National Committee from
its headquarters In this city. In its state
ment the committee' says:
"On. the eve of election the Republican'
National Committee's forecast of the re
sult, based on absolutely authentic and
unimpeachable figures and facts, differs
from its previous forecasts only In in
creasiftg the magnitude of the triumph
which Tuesday will bring to v the cause of
national honor and prosperity. All sources
of the committee's information, including
many that are very .'unwilling witnesses,'
concur - in indicating the conclusion - that
Tuesday's election will, prove a verUable
landslide for McKinley and seal the doom
of Bryan and Bryanism forever.
"The prime cause of this irresistible
and overwhelming popular revolt against
the Bryan Populist ticket Is perfectly ob
vious. It consists in the , desire of the
people to maintain the prosperity which
they have enjoyed and how enjoy under
the. policies of the McKinley administra
tion, and in their well-grounded fears of a
public calamity In case Bryan were to be
elected.
"The laboring man, his wife and his
children remember the poverty, the mis
ery : and despair which shrouded their
lives in the black years previous to Mc-
Klnley's inauguration, and they . remem
ber, with gratitude the relief which has
come . to them since . then, with abundant
employment aftd largely increased wages.
They listen now to Bryan's Invitations to
throw away their advantage, but they
respectfully decline them.
"Business men of the United States re
member what happened to them in those
same dark years, and they know what
the practical result of the election of 1896
has been in reference to the rehabilita
tion and prosperity of all lines of com
mercial enterprise during the last four
years. They correctly regard the propo
sition to indorse Bryan and his free trade
theories as nothing, short of insanity,
i "Farmers are not likely to forget the
evil days when they were reduced to bank
ruptcy and almost to beggary, and now,
with their mortgages lifted, their farm
products bringing greatly increased prices
and their homes filled with comfort and
4oy, they do not propose to change, their
conditions at the behest of the ' false
prophet of 1896 and the anarchical agita
tion of 1900.
"All who have remunerative work to
do, all who have wages paid to them, all
who have business to protect and develop,
all who have money deposited in savings
banks or invested in homes of their own,
have been confronted with a threat to
reduce the" value of _their property by
one-half and have been asked < to ratify
this suicidal proposition by their votes.
As they constitute the great mass of the
American people and as- they- are sane,
sensible and honorable men, the over
whelming majority for McKinley and
against Bryan which Tuesday will record
is thus accounted for. Â¦
"The people know that the country has Â¦
prospered under McKinley, that wages
have risen to a higher rate than ever be
fore, that employment Is abundant for
all,, that the savings, of labor have in
creased , a half billion dollars, that-com
mercial prosperity has been universal and
the - commercial .honor safeguarded
against the advocates of repudiation,
and- so they naturally have decided to re
elect him and continue present conditions
of national prosperity and safety." .
The committee's final . official forecast
claims at least" the following States for
McKinley and. Roosevelt:
States i and electoral . votes â California,
9; Connecticut. 6: Delaware. 3; Illinois,

Corruption alone can prevent."
Lieslie Combs, chairman of the Republi

P. L. Hall, chairman of the Democratic

Each party insists that it will surely

Virginia will give McKinley about 17,000

NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â Tho steamer St.
Paul of the American line, Captain Rob
efts in command, arrived in port today,
twenty-four hours late, with her star
board propeller gone and her engine room
badly damaged. Statements of different
officials vary as to the cause of the ac
cident, but the damage sustained by tho
steamship will probably amount to several
hundred thousand dollars. '
The. St. Paul left Southampton and
Cherbourg on October 24 with a full cargo,
31C cabin passengers and 2-15 in the steer-'
age. About 8 o'clock on tho evening of
Monday last, while some of the saloon
passengers were still at dinner and others
were promenading, a sudden shock was
felt all over the ship, although it was not
sufficiently severe to cause a panic. The
engines were stopped in a few â¢ minutes,
but it is said that during that brief tlmo
the whirling machinery, free of the weight
of the propeller.- wrought havoc In ths
engine room. The officials of the steani
ehip refused to allow anyone to enter
the engine rooms.
One of the engineers of the St. Paul
made the following statement to-night :
"It will tajie five months to repair the
damage, which is to the extent of from
$250,000 to $300,000. The starDoaxd engine
is a wreck. The ship did not strike a
derelict, but an unusually big sea struck
her. throwing the stern out of the water
and the propellers, having no resistance,
made frightfully rapid revolutions, which
caused the starboard engine to race and
the starboard tail Bhaft broke in two and
with the wheel fell into the water. The
amount of damage done Is not surprising
when you take into consideration trie sud
den liberation of, 10,000 horsepower.
"Four of the six cylinders are complete
ly wrecked, two piston rods are bent, one
connecting rod is bent and the starboard
engine shaft is sprung six Inches. The
starboard engine is wrecked beyond re
pair.' 1 . .
â¢James A. Wright, second vice-president
of the International Navigation Company,
which controls the American line, was u.
passenger on the steamship, having gone
abroad in October to bring back his
family. He said:
"I "was smoking in my stateroom when
I felt a slight tremor throughout the snip
I thought that probably her head had
fallen away a. few points and' thÂ£t she
had in consequence shipped a big sea, Tho
shock was so slight that the average
passenger did not apprehend that any
thing unusual had occurred. I went be
low to lind out what was the matter. I
found that ship had lost her starboard
propeller, together with part of her tail
shaft and had otherwise damaged her
machinery. â¢ .
"Captain Roberts and Chief Engineci
John Hunter are under the impression
that we struck a derelict. We were run
ning at full speed at the time, but were
not overtaxing her engines or driving her.
thief Engineer Hunter, at the moment
of the accident, happened to be passing
through the pantry and Immediately
turned the emergency valve, thus shut
ting off the steam. About tne same timo
the assistant engineer happened to be In
the vicinity of the tail shaft when the
propeller struck something and dropped
off, carrying with it a portion of the tail
shaft, which broke just inside the stern
of the ship. Th.e governing machinery
worked splendidly and the engines were.
brought to a full stop in ten seconds.
"The S.t. Paul will leave Tuesday 'for
the Cramps shipyard, where the neces
sary repairs will be made. Meantime the
Frlesland, which sails on Wednesday for
Antwerp, will take the St. Paul's pas
sengers, mails and freight to Southamp
ton.
Samuel Bettle, acting manager of tho
American line, said to-day, after consul
tation with Chief Engineer Hunter:
"At six minutes past 1 o'clock Wednes
day, while the ship was running at fuil
speed under the most favorable condi
tions, although she was pitching and roll
ing a good deal, the St. Paul's propeller
probably struck a derelict. The tail shaft
broke just inside the ship and the extreme
end of the propeller^ dropped into the sea
and serious damage was done to the star
board, engine, which was stopped within
ten seconds. None of the crew was in
jured and there was no excitement among
the passengers, many of whom remained
undisturbed at dinner, unaware that an
accident had occurred. Â»The ship had a
succession of strong head winds and seas
throughout, but it was not through driv
ing her that she lost her tall end Bhaft
propeller and stern tubing."

QUEENSTOWN. Nov. 4.â The Cunard
liner Saxonia, Captain Prltchard, from
Boston October 27, which arrived here this
morning brought fifteen members of the
crew of the fishing schooner Mary Mos
quito.-which the Saxonia sank off Glouces
ter on the day of her departure from Bos
ton. One member of the crew was
drowned. The Cunarder was not damaged.
Dr. Bond of Chelsea, Mass.. one of the
Saxorpa's passengers, made the following
statement regarding the accident:
"We were proceeding at reduced speed
in the fog and blowing the whistles about
6 o'clock p. m.,'when the lookout reported
a sail ahead. The engines were stopped,
but the Bteamer's way carried her into the
Mary Mosquito, making a big, opening
amidships and flooding the schooner. The
Saxonia s crew worked vigorously and got
out two boats. Into these fifteen of the
crew scrambled and put off from the fast
sinking vessel. Fortunately the sea was
smooth. All the mÂ«n are Portuguese. OnÂ©
of Â¦â¢ them unfortunately fell into the sea
and was drowned." ." - !

BERLIN, Nov. 4.â The Bourse had the
best week^it has known since the down
ward movement In prices began, about the
middle -of April. The American Iron mar
ket reports also played a large role in
supporting the prices of German iron
shares, notwithstanding the fact that the
reports from the centers of production
here had been growing Â¦worse- and worse.
The Dusseldorf Iron Bourse experienced
a heavy fall yesterday from the prices
recorded a fortnight ago, and Breslau
dealers reduced rolled Iron five marks per
ton. In the Siegon district many opera
tives were discharged, and the waiting at
titude of the consumers has grown pro
nounced. However, these conditions failed
to influence the Bourse.
Orders for industrials show good gains.
Government funds remain strong.
The increased speculation improved the
demand for money, causing an advance In
the private discount rate yesterday to
'4^ per cent.
Considerable attention is attracted to
the forthcoming nationalization of the.
Swiss railways. German capital Is ex
pected to participate heavily. American
participation excites apprehension In the
Berlin financial press, which Is evidently
growing Jealous of American successes in

though a complete fusion on the State
ticket was effected when the State con

has maintained separate headquarters
during the campaign. The chairmen, of
the other two fusion parties do not esti
mate Bryan's plurality quite so liberally,
but both agree that It will be over 60.000.
The claim of the fusionists as to the re

TONGU, China. Oct. 2.â A gift of a
large quantity of flour, rice and tobacco
from the King of Korea to the allied
forces has arrived here and been for
warded to Tientsin for distribution. The
present was accompanied by a letter from
his Majesty expressing his friendship and
goodwill to the allies and begging them
to accept the supplies There were in all
3116 sacks of flour. 9S6 sacks of rice and
2000 boxes of cigarettes, which have been
apportioned among the respective troops.
The share of the Americans has been for
warded to the mÂ»n at Peking.
The gift caused considerable comment
here and especially in view of the fact
that the letter from the Korean ruler
expressly requested that the supplies he
equally distributed among the forces. This
naturally includes the Japanese. The
cigarettes are much sought after as

A single ration is supposed to contain
enough food to sustain a man a day, and
in its package weighs .slightly more than
a pound.
The board has two different emergency
rations with which it will experiment. The
first is a ration prepared by the board
after an examination and analysis of the
food preparations used in nearly all the
European armies. The board's observa
tions and conclusions are embodied In the
ration, which was manufactured under its
supervision. The second Is a ration pro
duced by a company at Passalc. N. J. C
The New Jersey ration consists "of tea
in place of chocolate, and a combination
of meat and breadstuffs compactly ar
ranged. ,
The board's own ration consists of two
cakes of pure, sweet chocolate, three cakes
of a combination of meat and breadstuffs
in compressed form and a small quantity
of salt and pepper for seasoning. â¢ '
Captain â¢Fountain, who is president or
the board, said of the experiment: "Our
expedition will leave Fort Reno Just as if
it had been called suddenly away from its
base of supplies to fight an enemy in an
unknown and hostile country. The rou
tine of daily life will approximate as
closely as possible the conditions of
actual warfare. Five regular field rations
and live of the board's emergency rations
will be issued to each man at the start.
For two days the men will live on the reg
ular army field ration. On the third day
this field ration will.be abandoned and
the men put on the emergency ration,
which will be their only food for five days.
The test will be as rigorous as possslble,
so far as food is concerned. The results
will form the basis of the board's report
to the War Department.
"At the end of the seventh day we will
reach Fort Sill. The men will still have a
three days' supply of regular field rations,
which will be enough to carry them back
to Fort Reno." Â¦

Nov. 4.â General French has arrived at
Springs, a few miles from Johannesburg,
after a difficult march from Barbeton. He
has lost 1500 transport oxen since his ad
vance from Machadodorp. It Is believed
the plan of moving large bodies of troops
about the country will now be aban
doned, and the complete subjugation of
the country will be attempted by means
of garrisons in district towns, which will
be well stocked with provisions and made
bases for mounted troops that will scour
the territory around these bases.
General Roberts, before starting on his

BUFFALO, N. T., Nov.' 4.â Professor
Jacob Schurman, who passed through this
city this afternoon en route from the West
to Ithaca, gave out the following reply to
an open letter addressed to him by Sixto
Lopez:
Mr. Slxto Lopes' Â¦ open letter of the Sd inst.
addressed to me, although I have not yet seen
it except In the newspapers, is a gratifying
proof cf the correctness of the report of the
Philippine Commission. Mr. Lopez by his de
clarations confirms all I have eald of the prom
ising educational possibilities in the Philippines
anl the admiral character of the educated Fil
ipinos, few though they are. who may be taken
as a type and promise of the future. Nor does
Mr. Lopez deny that the' masses of the in
habitants of the .Philippine Islands of all
tribes end races are uneducated and very Ig
norant. Furthermore, by silent acquiescence
in the report of our committee Mr. Lopez
acknowledges that the majority of the Filipinos
either desire American sovereignty, as Is the
case with the men of education and property,
or acquiesce in It, or are- Indifferent to it. and
that the demand for Independence originated with
the^ambltlous Tagalo Insurgent leaders who have
diffused it with fire and sword, aided by atro
cious, misrepresentations of the aims and pur
poses of the Unltftd States. Lastly, Mr. Lopez
does not question the finding of our commis
sion that the inhabitants of the Philippine
Islands are marked by great racial and tribal
differences, by immense; varieties of social con
ditions, which range all the way from the
civilization of Manila down through all phases
of barbarism to the naked savage of Minando
and Northern Luzon, by a bewildering multi
plicity of languages which are mutually un
intelligible by dense ignorance on the part of
the masses of the people, by the absence of
union and concert and the utter lack of the
Idea and sentiment of nationality and by the
absolute inexperience of all classes In the af
fairs of government, which Spain always kept
in Spanish hands.
And the consequence to be drawn from all
this Is equally Indisputable; nor does Mr.
Lopez seek to dispute it. namely, that the
various and diversified peoples of the Philip
pine Islands are at the present time Incapable
of being considered as a nation; they are ut
terly unfit to accept sovereignty over the
archipelago, even If the American people
wished to invest them with it; nor have they
"any hopÂ« of ever becoming a free and self
governing nation, except in the continuance of
American sovereignty over them, and in the
peace, prosperity and ever-Increasing liberty
of self-government which the American flag
guarantees them. Pull down our flag and you
leave the Philippines a prey to internal feuds
and domestic insurrections which would quickly
beget anarchy. This would necessitate the
interventlon of foreign powers for the protec
tion of the lives and property of their subjects.
Of course, the islands would eventually be di
vided up amons them and the Filipinos would
exchange the free institutions and home rule,
which the American people desire as soon as
possible and in the l&rgeot degree practicable,
to bestow upon them, for the genuine lmperial
lim of the Old world emperors, kings and
czars. It Is the mission of our republic to
save the Filipino*, who, in general, are most
promising, estimable and even lovable people,
from this cruel fate, and to train them up to
the use of free Institutions and the noble work
of self-government Just as quickly and an gen
erously as they or any portion of them can be
induced to exercise a civic function, so arduous
and so unaccustomed.

Special Dispatch .to The Call.
COLUMBIA, S. C, Nov. 4. â James Swink. whose people have wealth and large interests in cotton mills at 'Wood
ruff. Spartanburgpounty, is in Jail at Spartanburg, charged with the murder o.f Mrs. "Wilhelmina Pearson, a very
well connected women and a leader in society, by whipping her .to death.
The affair of the whipping has been kept from the public since its occurrence in the middle of September
through the influence of Swink- It probably never would have been known had not .Mrs. Pearson, after terrible
suffering for six weeks, succumbed to the injuries Inflicted. The full story Is not yet known, but the main facts are
that Swink discovered Mrs. Pearson, who was a constant visitor at his house and a friend of the ladies of his family,
was bringing notes from a young man in Woodruff to one of the ladles. The contents of" the note Intercepted by Swink
may be made known at the trial. They can be conjectured now by the course pursued by Swink.
He had barely made the discovery when Mrs. Pearson called. Going into the parlor armed .with a stick or horse
hide he beat the woman until she became unconscious. When she revived he ordered her to leave Woodruff and she
went on the next train to Gastonia, N. C. There she was Joined by her husband, who had been spending a month in
the North Carolina mountains. She became ill on reaching town and after suffering for six weeks died of her in
juries Her husband testified before a committing magistrate that his wife's body was blackened by the strokes of the
stick. The young man who wrote the notes was warned in time to escape and is now in the West.
Swink "does not deny the whipping. His defense is that it did not produce death. The whole community is con
siderably stirred up. ... . .

monds that lighthouses with fog whis
tles be established in Southeast Alaska
at the following places:
Cape Cox, near the southern boundary;
Cape Cimmanna, entrance from the north
into Congas Narrows; Five Fingers in
Frederick Sound: also a fog signal at
ITnimak Pass. He also recommends a
inilltarv reservation at Dutch Harbor and
a coaling station, and thinks that the
need may arise at some future time for
erecting fortifications at this place.
General Randall, speaking of the na
tives of Alaska, says: "The Esquimau
has been unnoticed by the white man he
has befriended and has been allowed to
die for lack of care and food. From all
points reports have been received of sick- i
ness, starvation and mortality so great
that it promises to wipe out almost the en
tire race. Lieutenant T. H. Jarvis of the
United States revenue service reported
these facts to me and the tug Meteor was
placed at bis disposal for relief work and
about a hundred destitute natives cared
for at Nome. The revenue cutter Bear
has been distributing supplies to the des
titute natives, while others in the vicinity
of St. Michael have been cared for by the
commanding officer of that post. The
Â¦work of Lieutenant Jarvis is highly com
mended." , . ,
In closing this particular feature of his
report General Randall says:
"In many parts of the United States
provision has been mude for the Indians.
Reservations have been set apart for
them and food and clothing supplied. In
Alaska it was not necessary heretofore
to supply much, but the great rush of
white men that followed the discovery of
gold has completely changed everything.
The game and fur-bearing animate have
about disappeared and the natives' means
of sustenance are gone.
"I therefore recommend that the Gov
ernment afford some relief to the natives
until such time as they can take care of
themselves."
General Randall Â¦ also has this to say
regarding relief to white men who ven
tured into Alaska: â¢
"I am of the opinion that it would be
a mistake for the Government to give
any general aid in future to thÂ« venture
some classes of white men who come to
Alaska. About 300 have been sent out
on transports and other vessels this year,
and many more will be sent before the
close of navigation. The conditions are
now generally known throughout the
States and the expectation of Government
aid In returning to their homes in case
of failure has, without doubt, been the
hopeful prospect in view to a considera
ble number who have come to the coun
try since 1S97. and especially in the re
cent rush to Nome."
WASHINGTON. Nov. 4. - Brigadier
General George M. Randall, commanding
the Department of Alaska, under date of
Ppptember. at St. Michael, has submitted
his annual report. Much sj>acÂ« Is devoted
to conditions at Nome, which he found
upon his arrival at a critical stage. It
was difficult to obtain convictions by Jury
trial in the United States Commissioner's
off.ee. which emboldened the lawless.
Labor organizations prevented men from
working for lees than $1 an hour and wera
the cause of much, destitution and want
ar.d destruction of property.
Fully 1S.000 people trrived at Nome in
June. Oalm-Jumpine was the order of
the day. Many property-owners were
disposed to defend their rights by taking
the law into their own hands. Th<* ar
rival of troops prevented serious disor
der. The military took charg*. thorough
ly examined Into all complaints, and
where the rights of property should be
determined placed it !c possession of the
lawful owners. Captain W. A. Bethel,
who acted as Judge Advocate in these
cases. Is highly praised by General Ran
tfall.
The Bacltary conditions were placed un
der the charce of Major Charles B.
Ehert. surgeon. The energetic efforts of
the military improved these conditions.
There were apout 59u men working on
the beach at Nome with machinery at
on* time, and many declined to give an
swers concerning the prospects for gold,
while others admitted they were taking
out only from $4 to $S a day. The beach
was practically worked out last year.
The tundra is believed to be rich, but it
Â¦would require larger capital to produce
results. There is a large area of country
Â¦which has not been prospected where
gold yet can be found, but it requires a
man of general experience to develop such
a country.
Oeneral Randall says it has been de
cided to establish a permanent military
station on the island of St. Michael. He
recommends the purchase of two stern
wheel river steamers for operations on
the Yukon, and that all coal forage and
building material Intended for Alaska
pests be started from Seattle not later
than June 15 and shipped in sailing ves
sels for economy. Also that a cable be
laid from Seattle via Juneau and
Ekaguay to Valdes, connecting with the
telegraph lir.e now building over the all-
American route from Valdes to Port Eg
bert and down the Yukon River to Fort
Michael. When this line is completed.
General Randall says, military head
quarters should bÂ« in Southern Alaska
or at Seattle. ,

CALL HEADQUARTERS. "WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 4.â
"While the powers are discussing the
amount of indemnity they shall demand
of China the Imperial Government Is
shrewdly presenting suggestions, the
adoption of which will mean that the
Western nations will themselves pay the
amount demanded.
Li Hung Chang and his colleagues have
proposed that the maritime customs
be doubled In order that China may raise
sufficient money to pay the indemnity
which it is conceded is due the powers.
The - maritime customs are at present
pledged to Russia and in part to Germany
and England for loans advanced to the
Imperial Government. The amount of
likin. or internal revenue, raised, would
probably be sufficient to make periodical
payments if it could be turned into the
imperial treasury without passing
through the rapacious hands of provincial
and imperial officials. At this time a very
inconsiderable portion of the likln is
turned over to the Imperial Government,
and under present conditions it is im
possible to increase it. The Chinese Com
missioners appreciate the difficulties in
the way of increasing the llkin tax. and
they believe the indemnity can best ha
paid by increasing the maritime* cus
toms.
It is altogether unlikely that the United
States and other powers will assent
to any such proposition. A diplomat well
informed on Chinese affairs reiterated to
day that the best way of obtaining the
amount of indemnity would be to demand
confiscation of the estates of those who
were responsible for the outrages, and to
require the rich men of China to eon
tribute a proportionate sum. It Is ex
pected hero that China will issue bon'ls.
but how they shall be secured i3 a mat
ter which Is giving some concern. TtT">
authorities are urging the powers t<Â«
reach a conclusion, however, resoectin'-c
the amount of Indemnity to be demanded,
and when thts is determined the method
of collection can be discussed.
It seems to be generally conceded in
administration circles that the Emprp^n
Dowager and Emperor will not return t"
Peking until the former is advised of the
intention of the powers respecting her
future. Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Min
ister, has left no stone unturned to in
duce the imperial court to proceed to thf*
capital, but hit efforts have failed. The
powers seem practically united on the
proposition that the Kmpresa Dowrasrsr
must not further participate in the r>f
fairs of China, and that she must be re
moved to a point where she will exercise
no influence upon the imperial Govern
ment. This amounts to iÂ»xile. and will
certainly not be gratifying to the woman
who has dominated her country for *<*
many years. Because of the value of the
Emperor in the eye3 of the world, tlu-
Empress Dowager will probably hol'l
him practically as hostage.
The suggestion has been advanced ' tt>
permit the Empre?3 Dowager and the
Emperor to return to their oU! footing.
but to surround the Emperor with pro
gressive men and in this way alienate
, him from the influence of hfs royal aur.t.
: As the Empress Dowaser has been re
garded as the head of the Boxer move
ment, however, this suggestion is not
likely to be adopted.

FORECAST THE RESULT
To the Editor of The Call: The political battle Js won and all that re
mains for our friends to do is to see that the Republicans cast their ballots
and that they are honestly counted.
California will give McKinley and Roosevelt at least twelve thousand
plurality and the entire Congressional delegation will be Republican, as will
aJso be both branches of the State Legislature.

of California: that every Republican nominee for Congress will be elected,
and that the Republican paxty will have a majority of the membership of the

OAKLAITO, Not. 4. â The RemrbHeans of
Oakland will hold their last grand rally of
the campaign to-morrorr evening at the
Tabernacle. They have chosen the- last
night before the election as the time when
they will do their last shoutiay for th*Â»
ticket, when voters can listen to their last
speeches, bo that they can go to the polls
the day following: with a determination to
roll up for Alameda County the largest
majority it has ever given for the Repub
lican party. Four years ago Alameda
County saved the State to McKinley by
giving the biggest majority It ever gave
for a Republican President, and this year
the Republicans of Alameda propose to
add to the expected Republican majority
In other sections.
The meeting to-morrow nijrtot will be a
local one and will be devoted to listening
to local orators. There will be a few
short speeches, but the evening will be de
voted mainly to Congressman Victor H.
Metcalf and 'William R. Davis. Presiden
tial Elector on the Republican ticket.
Both of thesÂ© gentlemen will tell some
thing of tho campaign In the other por
tions of the State. Mr. iletcalf has been
In every town In his district and will tell
how the Third is soinp. William R. Davis
has Btumped half of the State of Califor

and he will have something to say for the
rest of the State.
THE KING OF THE CINCH BILL RING.
THERE was a mass-meetlnr of
colored people last evening in
the Zion Church, on Stockton
street, which was addressed by
Congressman Julius Kahn. Hen
ry C. Dibble and George "W. Dennis, a col
ored man. The church waa filled to Its
capacity by men and women, all of whom
gave close attention stnd generous ap
plause to the speakers.
Julius Kahn was the first speaker. Ha
spoke of the efforts of the "people of th.3
South to disfranchise the colored man
and suggested as a remedy that when the
time came for CongTess to pass appor
tionment laws the apportionment be baaed
not upon the number of people who re
side In a district but upon the number
who vote. In this way. he believed, the
negroes of the South would get their
right to vote Insured to them or the South
would lose much of Its standing and in
fluence In the halls of Congress and In
the electoral college. Mr. Kahn spoke
also of the record the colored race has
made In the army of the United States
and he recalled the gallant charge of the
Ninth and Tenth United States Cavalry,
two colored regiments, up the slopes a:
Ban Juan Hill to victory and everlasting
fame.
George W. Dennis compared the atti
tude or the South with that of the admin
istration toward the colored man and of
the efforts being 1 mode In the Southern
States to keep him In subjection. It was
time the colored man asserted himself,
he said. He believed that a race of sit
million people paying taxes on property
valued at fT.SQJiOOflOO waa entitled to some
consideration. There was a time when
there were those who stood up for the
colored racej It Is time now, he said, for
the colored race, to stand up for Itself.
Mr. DibblÂ« spoke on the tuiconstltiition
allty of the acts being pasved In tho
Southern States for the rvrposo of dis
franchising the negro.

CAHEFT'L study of impartial re

State convince the Republican
committee that McKinley and
Roosevelt will receive a plural
ity of 20.000 votes in California- Senator
Cutter, secretary of the committee,
tigns a statement that the plu
rality will reach that figure. Chair
man Stone does not wish to encour
age betting on SOjDOO, since in his signed
forecast he holds that the State will go
Republican by at least 12.W0. Chairman
6im* of the Democratic State Committee
is eomewhat of a claimant. He claims
that Bryan will win the State by 2o,l>lK). No
Democrat can be found willing to wager
money that Bryan will caxry California.
tenatcr is:ma as a L>emocratic ftHtesnian
is respected, but a* a political prophet nis
Imputation is yet to be made.
The special attention of voters is called
to the necessity of care in etaciijing tneir
ballots. They must stamp each namÂ»
voted for. They should be careful to vote
for each of the nine Presidential Electors.
In a former election the Republicans lost
cne elector by reason of the inattention
cf voters.
The Republican State Committee solicits
the volunteer services of good Republicans
to watch the count of votes in tnis city
to-xnorrow night. The committee 'desires
enly volunteers who will give their time
for the Republican ticket, and nut for
any individual candidate. Those who are
thus patriotically inclined will kindly call
at the headquarters of the Republican
State Committee in the Paiace Hotel to
day between 9 a. m. and 10 p. m.
Surprising as it may seem, there is still
much confusion in regrard to the long and
chort terms respectively for Superior
Judge. The contest for the short term is
between but two candidates. People of
intelligence, when asked to vote for Judge
Kerrigan, reply that they ate lor Judge
Lawlor or Coffee or Datng:erfi>ld or Sioss,
and that they cannot very well vote for
Kerrigan, believing that in sd doing they
would cast a vote against their man for
the long term. Judpe Kerrigan Is not
running against any of the candidates for
the long term. The short term for which
r.e is running is not <v> very short, in fact,
it is for four years.
The strong McKinlÂ«>y sentiment in San
Francisco is demonstrated nightly at the
Orpheum in this fashion. One of' the art-
Ifts sings a song in which she refers to
Bryan and McKinley and the applause
Goes not subdue come hisses. Fhe catches
the spirit of the occasion bv saying: '"I
em groin? to *fe what kind of a 'political
rouse this if. I propose that all in favor
of Bryan givÂ»Â» him thrr-e cheers." The
Bryanites make a good show of applause.
Then ehe says: ".Vow I propose thrrÂ°
cheers for McKinley." The great and
prolonged cheering which ensues shows
that the adherents of MrKinley outnum
ber the Bryar.ites two to one. The test
Is a fair on*>. as the audience is composed
of the average playgoers.

tcriupted him during his address. He
spoke in part as follows:
I am here to-day- to bring you what message
I may from the Bound-money Democracy,
from the gold Democrats, j who four years ago
Btood shoulder to shoulder with , the sound
money Republicans to defeat Bryan. This year
the sound-money Democrats still stand firm: in
their opposition to the election of Mr. Bryan.
We oppose him because he is not a Democrat
JOHN P. IRISH TRACES PROSPERITY
TO LEGISLATION FOR SOUND MONEY
Watch the ballots closely. Examine them carefully before any
name is called off. This will save time and avoid mistakes. GIVE
THIS CLOSE ATTENTION. Very truly yours,
Secretary.
The voter is entitled to vote for only T0TTB, candidates for the long
term and ONE for the unexpired term for Superior Judges. If the ballot
is marked with more than four names for the long term for Superior
Judges, then the ballot cannot be counted for any candidate for Superior
Judge for the long term: but it can be counted only for the candidates
voted for for Electors, Congressman, Senator, Assemblyman and Justices
of the Peace.
To be plain, the voter can vote for only four Judges for the long
term and only one for the short term.
A voter has the .right to vote for less than nine Presidential Elec
tors and less than four Judges for the long term.
The voter can only vote for^NINE Presidential Elector*. If the
ballot is marked with more than NINE names for Electors NONE of the
names voted for can be counted or tallied, but the ballot can be counted
only for candidates voted for Congressman, Senate, Assembly and
Judges.
Dear Sir: Your attention is called to the following:
Since The Call pointed out the liability to error that lurked In the official bal
lot the Republican State Central Committee has been busy devising ways and
means to impress even more directly If possible upon the voters of California
the necessity of care in the marking of their ballots. To this end It has caused
to be mailed broadcast the following circular letter:

Under the cold standard law we have cap
tured the markets of- the world. Previously we
could not manufacture cheaply enough to com
pete In foreign markets. There are Just two
ways to reduce the cost of productionâ by les
sening wages or by decreasing the cost of capi
tal. The sound money law cut down interest
and cheapened capital in this coantry and pro
duction is consequently cheaper. That Is the
explanation of our remarkable Industrial devel
opment during this administration.
If by the frowns of heaven Mr. Bryan should
be elected next Tuesday the wage earners would

est to us.
fully and conscientiously. "
Frank French made a short closing
speech.
I desire to briefly call attention to the
condition? existing now and the situation that
confronted the country four years ago. I would
like to ask what Mr. Bryan represents that
nrpeals to any man as a reason why he should
be elected President. He has abandoned his old
position and is chasing a phantom ot air.
Max C. Sloss, candidate for Superior
Judge, was Introduced. He spoke briefly
of national issues and in closing pledged
himself If elected to do his duty care-
be the first and most pitiable sufferers. If Mr.
Bryan should get into office factories would
shut down, fires would die out In the furnace
and our industries would be laid prostrate In
ruin.
Xow you have in San Francisco two Congress
men who have aided in the wise legislation that
Is at the foundation of our prosperity^ and I
want no man in San Francisco who understands
the value of sound finances and sound economics
to cast his vote against either Eugene F. Loud
or Julius Kahn for Congress. We want sound
money men In Congress. Tou have got them
there. Keep them.
Four years ago we thought William J. Bryan
had been disnosed of for all time. He Is still
trying to break into office. Â¦ We hope this time
to bury him 30 deep that he will never be
resurrected. Take no chances. That Is the art
vice we sound-money Democrats bring. A man
whoce inother-in-law had died was asked by
telegraph whether the body should be em
balmed, cremated or buried. He teleerraphed
back. "Embalm, cremate and bury. Take no
chances." So with Bryan next Tuesday. Em
balm, cremate and bury. Take no chances.
â¢Eugene F. Loud was tecelved with lou*d
applause. He said In part:
Under this sound-money regime the Interest
on the public debt has been reduced to -2 per
cent. We have ceased to be a debtor nation and
have become a creditor nation. We used to
work to pay interest to Kngland, to Germany.
Mr. Bryan said four years ago that if the gold
standard was maintained our schools would
have to be closed and labor would not have em
ployment. The Industries of the country were
then flat on the grcund. , Immediately upon the
election of McKinley our factories began to
prosper and now American laborers are in a.
better condition than laborers have ever been
anywhere. These 15.000,000 of wafte earners get
their pay In the best money In the world.
I want to say to the worklngmen present who
appreciate tho relations existing between sound
money and sound economics, that the election
of Mr. Uryan next Tuesday would have a more
harmful effect on the Industries of the country
than It would have had four years ago. The
Industries then could not have been thrown
down. They were already down. We have had
pictured for us the dangers of a standing army.
The only danger from an army that can possi
bly threaten our Institutions Is from an array
of unemployed, created by experiments in false
economics.

that the people should not be put to

does not provide for two appeals, and that
the counsel on the other side will say, as
euits his purpose, either that, having:
taken the first appeal, you have exhausted
your rights; that, having taken the sec
ond, vou have waived the first.
1. ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND LIT
IGATION â By expense I do not mean the
few thousand dollars which it is proposed
the State 6hould pay as salaries to two
extra Judges. A large and wealthy State
like our6 could well ailord a few thou
sand dollars for even a trifling improve
ment In its Judicial system. What I
mean by additional expense in tins con
nection is the few hundreds of thou
sands of dollars that the people will pay
to lawyers for legitimate fees on account
of the additional litigation which will be
generated by this constitutional amend
ment. In my first objection, eupra. I have
shown eonae of the new litigation; now.
In addition thereto, under section 3, it is
provided that within thirty days after
Judgment by a District Court of Appeal
a petition may be presented to the Su
preme Court to have the cause heard all
over ifcsiir by that court upon the ground
that the decision of the District Court of
Appeal "conflicts with a previous de
cision of the Supreme Court or of an
other District Court of Appeal." and If
the Supreme Court so finds It must try
sb'.I ov*rr again a cace that has been thor
oughly tried, argued and decided by the
Dictrict Court. If ever there was a pro
vision for a waste of labor, energy, time
and money, here It is. And do you not
know that every defeated litigant will
Insist upon his counsel filing a petition !n
the Supreme Court and contending for h.
rehearing and that every successful liti
gant will insist upon his counsel appear
ing contra, and must not the fees
of all these counsel be paid and
be paid by the people? And in
point of practice will there not
be a vast number of reiiearings in the
Supreme Court rendering useless the la
bor cf court ard counsel In the District
Court? It will be a poor case in whlcb
counsel cannot find a decision of the Su
creroe Court during the last fifty years
in conflict, or alleged conflict, with the
decision of the District Court of Appejl
upon some one or more of the many
points Involved in tha case. There are
hundreds of overruled Supreme Court de
cisions and yet this constitutional
amendment reads "in conflict with a pre
vious decision."
3 This amendment provides that a
judgment may be delivered by TWO Jus
tice* of a District Court of Appeal. I
would like to know who those two Jus
tices are before I would be willing to en
trupt to them such responsibility. At
present It requires THRLE Supreme
hourt Judcrcs to render a department de
cision and that decision Is always open

were to be abolished.
5. There is no limit to the appeals to
the District Court in respect of the
amount involved; The former'constitu
tion placed a limit at three hundred do -
lare: here there is none. There is no limit
to the right of appeal in probate cases.
6. The conceded Jurisdiction of the Su
preme Court is curtailed and belittle to
a degree which is offensive. It is con
fined to eminent domain, usurpation of of
fice and to criminal appeals where the
punishment is death or life Imprisonment
and questions arising upon city charters.

pettled between the railroad company and
the property-owner; If there is a contro

I am opposed to the constitutional
amendment, and fcr the following reasons.

To the Editor of The Call: Dear Sirâ
Pursuant to promise 1 have reduced to
writing my views en the subject of the
proposed new Courts of Appeal and sub
mit them to you herewith.
East Oakland, Nov. 3. m).
9. The standard of the District Courts
wili naturally be inferior to that of the
present Supreme Court. Thev will be con
sidered, and will be in fact* as to the lat
ter, inferior courts. The dignity of the po
sition will not be an Incentive to good law
yers to take that bench. It is a ratal mis
take to depreciate the judiciary of a
State; the bar takes its tune from the
bench, and both become degenerate. Lit
igation becomes more uncertain, more ex
pensive and -finally intolerable. Some day
the people of this Stato will learn, as
other States and countries have learned,
that it is poor policy to employ inferior
Judges. If the Judges of the lower courts
were given large salaries and the best
men at the bar induced to go upon the
bench, their decisions would become au
thoritative and not be appealed frum as
a matter of course in every case. It
would cost the STATE a few thousand
dollars more money, but !t would save
the PEOPLE millions in the expense of
their appeals. Yours very truly.
W. S. GOODFELLOW.
Cases of usurpation of office are infre
quent; sometimes a country Constable In
sists upon holding over upon some tech
nical ground. According to this amen'a
ment ne would be entitled to the priv
ileges of the Supreme Court. Criminal
appeals are always taken by persons con
victed after a preliminary examination
before a magistrate or upon indictment
of a Grand Jury, and a suusequent trial
in the Superior Court upon a unanimous
verdict of twelve jurors. Why should the
exclusive privileges of the Supreme Court
be given to these convicted murderers,
burglars and highway robbers and the
like privileges be denied to the hon?st cit
izen In defense of his property rights?
7. The amendment introduces a vast
amount of new litigation and new ques
tions. It creates labor for Judges and law
yers which is at present unknown to the
bench and bar. This I have specified in
my objections 1 and L\ supra.
8. The new courts aro independent of
f-ach other iind of the Supreme Court.
Causes cannot be transferred for hear
ing from one to the other; this is a step
backward. If any one of these courts.
say. for instance, the San Francisco
Court of Appeals, should become over
crowded with business, it couUl obtain nr>
relief from any of the other cjurts, even
if the Supreme Court and the other two
Courts of Appeal should be comparatively
idle. At present the Supreme Court de
partments give and take cases from each
other day by day.

Amendment No. 4, concerning primary elections
(giving the legislature power to enact laws relative

primary elections)."
DECISIONS of the Supreme Court have made
it clear that -we cannot have in this State a
valid primary election law without so amend
ing the constitution Â«s to authorize such a law. An
amendment for that purpose is submitted in this elec
tion. Upon the official ballot it is marked:
FOR HONEST PRIMARIES.
Against that amendment not a single vote should
be cast, ncr should any */oter who takes a pride in the
financial honesty of the State and its cities neglect to
vote for it. It f?hou!<3 be neither opposed nor over
looked. The ieachtrs of our public schools are paid
none too much for their work, and they render a
most important service to # the State. They have made
our public school system an object of just pride *o

Let i'l vote for this amendment, which author
izes the just payment of a just debt
It is marked upon the official ballot: "Amend
ment No. 7 â Being Senate Constitutional Amend
ment l$o. 15." It provides "for the payment of un
jjsid claims against the city and county of San Fran
cisco and tli* city of Vallejo of Solano County." â¢
LTPOX communities as well as upon individuals
j rests an obligation to pay in full every debt
justly due. and that obligation is the more bind
ing if the debt be due for labor rendered in a good
racse and faithfully done. San Francisco owes a
debt of that kind to many of the teachers in her
public schools. It is -not to be doubted that every
recent citizen :s willing and eager that the debt be
paid, but under our laws th; payment cannot be made
Â¦without an amendment to the constitution. To the
people of the State, therefore, an amendment" has
been submittted for that purpose, and should receive
the support of all.

Four armored cruisers of the .Essex
class, building In England, are probably
the type which the majority of the Board
of Construction in Washiygton had in
view when it recommended three armored
cruisers of 9542 .tons trial displacement in
place of three protected cruisers of 8300
tons, proposed by the Chief Constructor.
The Essex class includes the Bedford,
Kent and Monmouth. These cruisers aro
9800 tons. 440 feet in length. C6 feet breadth
and 24 feet 6 Inches draught. They wlil
have engines of 22,000 horsepower, driv
ing the ship at a speed of 23 knots. The
armor belt of 4-inch Krupp steel extends
for a length amidships of 250 feet, taper
ing to two Inches at the ends. The mala
armament consists of fourteen 6-inch
oulck-flrers, of which two are carried In
each turret forward and aft. on tho
main deck amidships and four tin the up
per deck. All the broadside guns are car
ried in 4-inch casemates, and the turrets
and bases are five inches thick. The sec
ondary battery Includes ten 12-pounders
and three 3-pounders an& there are also
two submerged torpedo tubes. There is
some talk about changing the main bat

for the four 6-inch guns In the turrets.
The ships proposed by the United States
Board of Construction are to be 424 feet
in length, 66 feet beam and 24 fee* 6 inches

tical with the British ship, the secondary
battery calls for. eighteen 14-pounders and
twelve 3-pounders; the speed is to be Â¥2

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
There is no need for these additional courts.
During the whole course of the campaign the advo
cates of the scheme have rarely undertaken to defend
it before the people. Now and then a letter would
appear on the subject, and such as were sent to The
Call were duly published, but they were few and far
between; and in no case did ihe arguments of. the
writers meet the serious objections which the people
have to the scheme. We have courts enough. 'There
arc already ample opportunities for appeal on every
sort of ground that legal ingenuity can devise. The
burden of taxation is already as heavy as it should
be. There is in short nothing to justify the creation
of three new courts and the payment of salaries to
nine "apointed" Judges, whose appoinirments have
doubtless been already slated by the men who de
vised the scheme.
Vote "NO" on amendment No. 8.
This amendment is marked on the official ballot:
"Amendment No. 8 â Being Senate Constitutional
Amendment No. 22, relating to the judiciary and
establishing courts of appeal."
UNNEEDED COURTS OF APPEAL.
AMONG the constitutional amendments sub
mitted to the people in this election is one'pro
viding for the creation of three'eourts of ap
peal, each to be composed of three Judges. For the
proposed new courts hardly a single reason can be
given, but against them there are a hundred. The
objections to the scheme are many and serious. The
establishment of the additional tribunals will disorder
the whole judiciary system, will impose upon the
taxpayers an additional burden of taxation and will
in the first instance place the appointment of nine
Judges in the hands of the Governor, when the set
tled principle of our politics is that Judges should
be elected by the people.

For the stay at home voter there can be no ex
cuse this year. Now is the time to crush Bryanism
and sweep the remains off : the earth:'
When William Jennings Bryan sought the cheapest
publisher he could find for his books it is reasonable
to suppose that he felt that cheap thoughts ought to
have cheap clothes.
Make up your mind to-day that to-morrow you
will vote* early and then get out and urge your friends
to vote. Take no chances with Bryanism.
Recent revelations are reasonably good evidence
that every favorable condition is present for the'oper-"
ation of a full-fledged faro game in the office of <
George W. Root, clerk of the Supreme Court \*i*
The Eastern authoress who has contracted brain
fever because of the severity with which her works
have been criticized must have either a guilty con
science or the advice of a shrewd press agent.
It is safe to say that the adherents of Tammany are
not sufficiently anxious to suffer the torments of
broken heads as to follow the advice of Richard
Croker to" use violence at the polls on Tuesday.-
For the welfare and th'e good repute of the State
let us have an honest Legislature. No "crooked
politician" should be elected to either the Senate or
the Assembly, no matter upon what ticket nominated.'
What McKinky has done for American industry
and American labor has evidences on every farm and
m every factory, mine, market place and home in
the country; but what has Bryan ever done for the
workingman?
If the people in this election kick the tools of the
Southern Pacific out of politics, it is probable the
new managers of the road will erase them from its
payroll;, and we shall then have clean politics and
clean railroading to start the new century with.
Under our system of government all interests of
property or person are dependent for security upon
an honest, independent and learned judiciary. We
must have good judges, therefore vote for Coffey,
Daingerfield, Lawlor and Sloss for full terms on the
Superior bench, and for Kerrigan for the unexpired

H. Nelson in the Twenty-fifth. Each of these men

LEADING BALTIMORE DEMOCRAT
STRONGLY OBJECTS TO BRYAN
Frank S. Hambleton Turns Against Bryanism
and Will Vote for McKLinley and Good
Government
FRANK S. HAMBLETON, a promi
nent Democrat of Baltimore and a
member of the banking firm of
Hambleton & Co.. of that city, is
strongly opposed to William J.
Bryan as a candidate for the Presidency.
Mr. Hambleton presents his reasons as
follows: â¢â¢>.
Editor San Francisco Call: When the
Chicago platform of 1S96 was adopted as
the creed of the Democratic party I
could find nothing in it that appealed to
me as a Democratâ its declaration for a
dishonest currency, Its denunciation of
our highest court. Its appeals to social
ism and its tendency, toward anarchism
disgusted me. I believed that the man to
whom the Democrats sought to intrust
the carrying out of their propaganda,
surrounded as he was by some or the
most vicious political advisers, would not
hesitate to go to the full UmJUi o* the
platform; that ruin would overtake thU
fair land as the certain result of h s ef
forts if elected; and even though his ef
fort! might not be successful the appre
hension of what .he would endeavor to do
would for a long time paralyze our lndus
tr Mr" Bryan stated distinctly In 1896 that
so soon 7s he was elected he would do all
fn his power to abolish the gold standard:
he hai? never revoked that promise and
his seeking to create an Issue which only
exists in his Imagination In order to dl-
vert attention from one which he despot
ically compelled the Kansas City conven
tion to recognize by the Insertion of hi3
16 to 1 plank is puerila and dishonest.
Bryanism is the "paramount issue" of
this campaign and '3 fraught with raoro
dread consequences than all it.e military
bugaboos evolved from the fevered brain
of Mr. Bryan and his Boxer allies. Alt
geld, Tillman, Debs. Wellington. Croker
and others.
Mr. McKlnley's record Is one he may
well feel proud of. Prosperity Is every
where apparent; his foreign policy is dlc
nlfled and strong and his promises to es
tablish the gold standard have been per
formed, and his administration has met
and mastered more untried problems than
any one since Lincoln.
This nation to-day is oppressing no on*
and it must be conceded that our peo
ple in the Philippines and Porto Rico will
get fully aa much benefit of our constitu
tion and the Declaration of Independence
and that. too. in less time than will our
dusky fellow-citizens lately disfran
chised, but taxed, by admirers and sup
porters of Mr. Bryan, whose sympathies
are all for those who are murdering our
soldiers.
I feel confronted to-day with the ques
tion. Shall it be "duty or desertion?" I
voted In 1896 as I believed It my duty to
do. I cannot desert hi November. The
fight is the sameâ Bryanism versus good
government. I shall vote for McKlnley
and good government.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The voting spaces on the ballot opposite the con
stitutional amendments are marked "yes"â "no." So
there need be no mistake there. The one danger is in
voting for too many condidates when making up, a
list from the several tickets. Upon that point the
voter must be careful.
One member of the Assembly.
The voter will find an easy guide in making up
his ballot in the fact that the Republican, the Demo
cratic and the Social Democratic tickets have each
nominated a full set of candidates for each office, and
no more. Consequently if he vote for as many for
each office as are to be found in the lists of either of
those parties named for that office, he will make no
mistake. It may be as well to point out, however,
that each voter is entitled to vote for the following:
Nine candidates for Presidential and Vice Presi
dential Electors.
Four Judges of the Superior Court for the full
term.
One Judge of the Superior Court (unexpired
term). â¢ â¢
Five Justices of the Peace.
One Representative in Congress.
One State Senator (in districts where Senators arc
to be elected).
THE BALLOT AND THE VOTER.
WHEN the voter enters the polling booth and
opens the official ballot, he will find upon it no
instructions as to the number of candidates for
a particular office he is entitled to vote for. He
should therefore post himself upon that point at once.
It is a matter of importance to him, for if he vote
for one too many for any office his entire vote so
far as that office is concerned will be null and void.
Thus far all is well, but the end is not yet. New
roorbacks are doubtless in preparation and may bt
sprung upon the people during this last day of the
fight in the expectation that truth will not have time
to crush the lie before the election tak'es place. It 1?
therefore timely to warn the public against them.
That is something that has to be done in every cam
paign, and the warning is needed now as much as
ever. Let no man be deceived. The roorback is the
tavorite weapon of desperate demagogues, and th*
Bryanites are desperate.
WE have reached the closing day of the earn
paign, and the time for the roorback has
come. Two of them of considerable magni
tude, one in the national and one in the local field,
have already appeared. The first was a 'declaration
that Senator Scott of the Republican National Com
mittee had asserted in a speech at a banquet given to
Roosevelt that our prosperity is due to trusts and that
he is in favor of them. The second is the
circulation in the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict of a "dodger" addressed "confidentially"
to Spanish-American voters, to- the effect that
fames McLachlan, the Republican nominee, is
noted for his hatred of the Catholic church,
and as a member of Congress had said in a speech in
the House: "When the appropriation bill was pre
sented to Congress for debate I was surprised to know
that this Government made such large appropriations
to the institutions managed by the Catholic church. I
voted to strike from the bill every appropriation to
an institution of this kind, odious and hateful in
principle."
These two roorbacks have been exploded. Senator
Scott has denounced the falseness of the charge con
cerning him, and Mr. McLachlan has refuted the lies
of the, dodger. It is not likely that either of these
two will be repeated. No Democrat of decency will
uphold either of them, and the yellow journals of
Bryanism will hardly dare to reiterate them. As a
matter of fact the recoil has hurt the Democrats more
than the charge has injured Republicans,*and we may
be sure that all who were concerned in launching the
falsehoods will hunt cover until the election is over.
THE DAY OF ThjE ROORBACK-
In San Francisco trade is healthy and more active
than in other parts of the country. Provision men
report large shipping orders for cured meats, though
prices are a shade off, owing to local cutting by Chi
cago houses. More tone in wool is observed, the
inquiry having been better during the past ten days.
Hides a:id leather continue very firm, and the former
have gone up several times within as many weeks.
The demand for canned goods is steady, but dried
(toils are very slow, as the fall buying is largely over.
Rp.isins continue brisk at firm prices. The minor
cereals are strong, and several have advanced. Beans
have risen rapidly of late, in spite of heavy receipts,
and the farmers along the Sacramento River are reap
irg a rich harvest in consequence. Prices for live
stock continue good, with no indications of any de
cline at present. Th= oil industry seems to be mak
ing great strides; new wells are continually being
struck, and the transactions on the local oil exchange
have increased materially during the past thirty days.
Local stocks and bonds, however, have been dull
fnr some liule time. Collections are reported up tc
the average, and money continues plentiful at rates
of interest which are tending downward rather than
Wall street is acting cautiously, with an eye to
the election, and business there is slow. Large houses
bare been looking to their fences in view of any
emergency, and have advised their customers to re
strict their operations until after the 6th. There is
general confidence in the result, but the long heads
who govern the street do not mean to be caught
napping.
The staples showed little change. Wheat started
up again under advene reports from the Argentine,
l>ut ihr advance was wary and skeptical, and was
mostly lost again at the close. The iron and steel
trades report an improved demand for their products,
* : th slight advances at several points. Some im
jortnnt foreign contracts have been placed, buyers
<*ecid:npr not to wait for the result of the election in
the general confidence that the country will make no
change in its administration this year. There is more
activity in wool, with slightly firmer prices, though
no real advance is reported. The continued warm
weather in the East still affects the distributive trade
l>y postponing the usual retail demand for winter
goods.
The failures for the week were 198. against 183 for
the corresponding week last year. As a rule they
were ?ma!l arid without significance.
The country's bank clearings were 12.9 per cent
below those of the same week in 1899. Considering
that there was a commercial boom last year, with
no election staring ibe country in the face, the ex
hibit last week was encouraging. It is a question
whether, if the Presidential election were eliminated
this j-ear. last week would not have shown an actual
gain over I So/?. As usual the largest cities exhibited
the heaviest decrease, New York losing 15.3 per Cent,
Boston 22.6 per cent. Chicago 7.7 per cent atjd Phila
delphia 14.8 per cert. Piitsburg showed a slight in
crease of .6 per cent, which speaks well for the con
dition of the iron and steel trades.
EVEN* in the liveliest times the week immediately
preccding the Presidential election is never
brisk, and last week was ho exception to the
rule. Trade was quiet all over the country- There
were no fluctuations of importance, no new opera
tions were recorded, and the attitude of the nation
was one of waking.

WHAT MISS FLORENCE BRECK
INRIDGE SAW IN THE STREET
CAR.
ALL experience shows that when a people under
take to' tax their own bonds they work an
injury to themselves. In no land has the les
son of that experience been more fully taught than
in California. We have imposed ta-xes on public
bonds for many years, and as a consequence the
greater portion of such bonds have been sold to non
residents and held abroad where they could not be
taxed. Thus the people have lost the income they
sought to gain by the taxation, and have been forced
to send out of the State the interest due upon the
bonds. Furthermore the taxation has had the effect
of discounting the bonds in the market, and , the
people have obtained less money for them than would
have been obtained otherwise.
To remedy the evils resulting from that unwise
system of taxation there has -been submitted to the
people a constitutional amendment exempting from
taxation "all bonds issued by the State of California,
or by, any county, city, city and county, municipality,
niunicipal corporation of any sort, or district (in
cluding school, reclamation and irrigation districts)
within the State."
On the official ballot this amendment is marked
"Amendment No. 4â Being Senate Constitutional
Amendment No. 14." Vote "yes." Such a vote will
help to relieve the State and its various communities
from the ill effects of the existing law. .The exemp
tion will enable every community" to sell its public
bonds to greater advantage, to obtain money at less
rates of interested" to keep at home the money now
sent abroad for interest payments. Every community
in the State and every class of people will benefit by
the exemption. Vote for it.

SOCIETY: WHAT BURLINGAME DOES FOR ITS PLEASURES.
The conservative elements of the American people,
Democratic as well as Republican, should approach
this ; election with a clear understanding of the
momentous isssues" that would be at stake should
Bryanism survive to make appeals to class hatreds and
to popular discontents in all the complex elections
that are to follow this. It is no slight thing that
one of the great historic political organizations of the
republic should be dominated by a man so unscrupu
lous in his methods and so wild in his creed. Politi
cal apathy at this time is almost tantamount to a lack
of patriotism. Xo good citizen should indulge it. Go
to the polls and vote for the prosperity of the
country and the redemption of Democracy.
1 â ;OR the achievement of a sweeping victory this
I year,. there is needed only that every citizen who
. desires the continuation of the prevailing pros
perity based upon protection and sound money
should go to the polls. The one danger is that of
apathy resulting from overconfidence, buf; that
danger is serious. It is now so well assured that Mc-
Kinley will be elected by an overwhelming majority,
pot only of the electoral college but of the popular
vote, that many citizens who dislike the duty of
going to the polls and voting will be sorely tempted
to stay at home or at their places of business, under
the conviction that their votes will not be needed.*
Such feelings should be put away from the heart
of every patriotic citizen. It is desirable not only
that Bryan be defeated, but that the whole propa
ganda of Bryanism be crushed out of our politics by
the weight of a popular majority so large it will never
have enough strength again to get possession of one
of the great parties of the country. This is an issue
whose importance can hardly be estimated. In times
of prosperity like this Bryanism is not dangerous,
but it was a grave menace to the republic in the hard
times of 1896, and should it be permitted to live with
any prestige at all after this election it will be a ter
rible menace indeed when next overspeculation and
overproduction result in the inevitable reaction from
the industrial and commercial activity that now pre
vails. â¢
THE DANGER OF 0PATHY.
A fair, honest primary election law is a vital need
of our political system. The amendment submitted
to that effect should, therefore receive the support of
every fair minded, honest man. Vote "yes" for
amendment No. 5. Â¦
not be lost upon the intelligent voter. ".Wide open"
primaries are the avenues through which the ward
bosses "and their gangs attain power in politics.
Where there is no law to prescribe punishment for
offenses committed at the primaries, the bosses prac
tice every 'manner of fraud and violence. Honesty
has hardly any chance against corruption under such
circumstances, and consequently good citizens in
many districts abandon the contest and leave the pri
maries to be run by ward heelers as they please. '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NO YEMBER 5, 1900.
For that amendment every man who is in favor of
honest politics should vote. The lesson taught by
the primary elections of both parties in this city and
elsewhere at the beginning of this; campaign should

Success in life, Father Huntlngton said.
can only be attained by the direction of
the energies toward the end for which
God has fitted a man. The difficulty was,
he said, to find out just for what a man
was best fitted, but this could be done by
asking the only one who knew â God.
"A man's identity is divided into three
parts," said the speaker, "his will, his
heart and his mind. His mind is given
him that he may know God; that he may
learn of his infinite g&odness and mercy
and his eternal love. The heart Is given
to a man that he may love God, who is
infinite love. A man must love something,
and he should love somethings that will
uplift him and beget in him newer and
stronger love, for all mankind aa well as
for God. If he loves wisdom, he will find
it in God; if he loves knowledge, he will
find it in God: if he loves purity, he will
find it in God. But if he turn from God
and love only himself, his love will turn
to hate and in time he will loathe himself.
"So a man can find out what he will suc
ceed, at by asking God; and he can find
out all the sooner if he will first ask him
self what he is unfitted for. There are
many things which a man can see at once
are not for him. A sinful life is not for
him. He knows in his heart that God
never Intended him for that. Let him seek
this knowledge from God and he will re
ceive it."
Father Huntingdon appeared In his cas

"The world has no regard for a man out
of his place, and God cannot Â«top to en
dangve. his plan to turn aside for a man
out of his place. He will help the fool if
the fool be wllllntf. but ho cannot stop if
the fool be Bet !n his folly. Man was given
a will that ha might exercise it freely, but
there is a difference between a man who
cannot do a mean or sinful act because
it is beneath his manhood and the man
who can. The man who can do a sinful
act may believe he is the free man, but it
is he whose nature re'yolts at unmanliness
and sin that is the real free man. Aman
out of place may keep to his folly, but if
he do he must be crushed under the on
rush of God's laws.
He-Is jriven a will that he may do God's

VACAVILLE. Nov. 4.â The last carload
of green fruit has been shipped from
Vacaville to the East, making a total of
552 cars for the season, against about 700
carloads last year. The decrease was
due to the unusual amount of fruit dried.
There have been 267 cars of dried fruit
forwarded East, as against about 75 cars
last season, and it is estimated that there
are nearly 100 carloads in the valley to
be shipped yet. The returns from the
fruit Bhipped this year were not as large
as In 1S99, which amounted to $700,000. The
receipts for the past season only ag
gregated $600,000. The difference is prob
ably traceable to the'fact that the past
season has been most unsatisfactory in
the matter of time made to the Eastern
markets. Of course there were other rea
sons, but the future of shipping green
fruit to the East is dependent upon a
more expeditious railroad service.

While the fields at Oakland track this
afternoon are not so "classy" as on the
opening day. they are evenly balanced
and some splendid sport should result.
The stables of Sam Hildreth and Green
Morris are again represented, as well as
those of several other Eastern owners.
The racing on Saturday created a most
favorable impression among followers of
the turf, and a successful season of sport
is assured.
Just at present there is a scarcity of
riding talent, which will disappear no
doubt very shortly. Pat Dunne expects to
secure the services of T. Knight, and
"Walter Jennings la waiting patiently to
hear from the employer of George Odom.
The latter received a fearful fall last
year on one of the Eastern tracks, and
for a time his riding was oft* color. Now
it is said his courage Is gradually return-
Ing and he bids fair to recover his old
form. Patsy McCue and young . Slack
will also be seen on the local tracks, so
reports say.
The stable of Brown & Llger Is due to
arrive at Oakland to-day. "Curly"
Brown, one of the firm, is well known
in this section of the country, where his
ability as a starter first brought him Into
prominence. The fast sprinters, Gold Or
and Merry Day, are members of this
string. Wedderstrand is the stable Jockey.
It Is not generally known that besides
being considered, the top-notch trainer of
this country, Sam Hildreth has few equals
at plating the race horse. When younger,
Sam tried his hand at riding, after which
he became a Liacksmith.'
Though the bookies were not pestered
with any great number of big: bets on Sat
urday, they were all well pleased with
the outlook. Paul Ridley, George Rose,
Gus Miller, the Palace Club, Jim Davis,
Johnny Coleman and F*red Cook were all
mentioned as comfortable winners, with
the others to hear from.
One Eastern penciler took a rather hard
fall out of Bavassa in the betting, still
this same bookmaker is a big gambler
and the fact that he did should crea'te no
distrust. Stuart, who rode the filly, has
never been accused of wrongdoing, and
it was no doubt a fit of the sulks which
caused the filly to fall out of it early.
It is rumored that the officials of the
San Francisco Jockey Club . are not in
favor of using the recall flag.
If Thomas, who rode Grand Sachem on
Saturday, expects to become a rider, he
should put a dash or two of tabasco sauce
in his soup when dining. It doesn't look
well to go duck hunting on a horse that
recedes from 6 to 15 to 1 In the betting.
Billy Randall had a swell bet down on
Gauntlet to win the mile and a sixteenth
event, taken by Bangor. Fauntleroy
scrambled the eggs badly.
Following are the entries for this after
noon's events:
First raceâ Five furlongs; maiden two-year
olds; purse.

the Single Tournament at Cali-
Heavily Handicapped, He Attacehs

The semi-finals and finals of the single
handicap tournament at the California
Club were played off yesterday and
George Whitney won the first prize. He
was heavily handicapped all through the
tournament, but* by his skillful playing
he distanced all competitors.
The first match was between John
O'Brien and Richard Ersklne. Erskine re
ceived 15 and 1-6 and in the first set, by
well placed drives, won with a close saore
of S-6. The second was another deuce and
vantage set which O'Brien won. 8-6. by
his clever back-hand, cross-court shots.
Tne third set and match was won by
O'Brien. 6-4. Erskine was tired and off
his game. . ** ;!?Â¦â¢"*'
The next match was George Whitney
vs. Paul Jones. Whitney gave Jones 15
and owed 30. The first set was hotly
contested.- both playera winning to the
net at all times. Whitney won. 6-4. In
the second Jones made a stand and by
clever volleying made It 4 all. â¢ Whitney
won the next two games and set, 6-4.
In the finals Whitney gave O'Brien 30.
Whitney won the first set easily, 6-1. The
second was his also, 6-1. The third, la&t
set and .match, fell to Whitney, 6-1.-
The British ship Springbank Is having a
lot of trouble getting rid of her cargo.
While rounding the Horn she had a ter
rible time of it. and many of her sails
were blown away. But luck came with
the end of the voyage, the captain's wife
presenting him with an heir. The decks
were swept during the heavy weather and
much water got down into the forehold.
Much cement was In the cargo, and 1400
barrels of it are "cemented" together so
tightly that it will take crowbars to get
the barrels apart. About fourteen pianos
that formed part of the cargo are ruined,
and, all in all, the voyage, of the Spring
bank will prove an expensive one for the
insurance men. Captain Crosthwaite's
wife and child are doing well at fat Mary's
Hospital. The baby was born the day tho
Springbank made port.
A Change of Time.
The Pacific Coast Steamship "Company
Is always up to the times. Another steam
er has been added to the southern route,
and Messrs. Gcodall, Perkins & Co. now
announce that four boats a week will
leave San Francisco for San Pedro and
way ports. The Santa Rosa will leave
every Sunday and the Queen every
Wednesday. These vessels will be filers,
not stopping at way ports until Santa
Barbara 1b reached. After leaving Santa
Barbara they will touch at Port Los An
geles Redondo and San Diego. The Coro
na will leave every Friday, and the Bonita
every Tuesday. These vessels will stop at
all way ports and will, fill In'the blanks
left by the fliers.

Across ttie Bay Captured
by an Olympic Club
â¢ Wheelman.
The sixth annual 10-mile handicap road
race of the California Associated Cyclists
was held yesterday over the Fruitvaie-
Haywards course. The read was in splen
did condition and fast time was made.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen captured
first place. J. P. Simmons, a three-min
ute man, winning- the race, while the Gar
den City Whtelrnen of San Jose made
fastest time, l^ace T)owning covering tho
course in 23 minutes 57 seconds.
There was one unforunate accident,
which marred the race somewhat. H.
Noyes, of the Sacramento Club, while rid
ing to the start, was, run over by a team
and badly bruised. Otherwise the race
was without incident.
The following table show6 the 6core:
SIMMONS WINS
THE TEN-MILE
CYCLING RACE
Stockton 4, Oakland 2.'
Jim McDonald, umpire, referee and de
feater of champions, eat in judgment yes
terday at tho diamond mix-up between
the Dudes and the Millers. In the sixth
inning something happened which looked
very much as If McDonald was looking
through unwashed windows. "When it was
all over two of the Millers scored, tho um
pire's decision making the runs possible.
To McDonald's credit it may be said that
he was in a. position that made- it impos
sible for him to see the play.
Thlg is how the only featural event of
the game- happened: Two of the Millers
were sleeping under tombstones chiseled
by the Dudes, Moore was on the third baj
and Streib on liret. McGucken, at bat,
rolled the ball to Fraucks. who, after a
pretty 6top, threw low to Lohman at lirst.
Lobman's foot strayed from the bag as
he caught the ball, but ho recovered an ln
etaiit before McGucken reached the Initial
fetation. This McDonald could not see, so
he called the runner safe. When Lohman
realized what, the decision was he began
to throw wildiy, and the ball streaked the
infield before it found a resting place at
second. Moore and Streib having crossed
the rubber. '-
The game started well, but after the
third inning dragged painfully. In the
third Courtney made the first of his two
baggers. McGucken. who then did the
running act for him, stole third and scored
when Harper hit to Lohman. In the
ninth Graham scored for the MUlers,
which, with the two runs of the. sixth,
made the score four for Stockton.
The Dudes scored in the sixth and
seventh. With Lohman on third and Bow
man on first. Graham tried to force the
third out as Bowman started to steal sec
ond. He threw wildly, and Lohman
scored while Bowman was safe. In the
eighth, with Francks on second and Held
en first, Pop Hardie batted out a double
to right. Francks scoring, but Held died
at the plate.
Few hits and many errors were the
wearisome attributes of the game. The

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 14, Stockton 5.
Oakland won the game yesterday morn
ing on the Oakland grounds by tearing
strips off the ball. Babbitt, who was on
the slab for the Millers, was so easy for
the Dudes that not an inning passed with
out a hit off his delivery, and In four In
nings great bunches of exploded fireworks
were etrewn over the field. For the mat
ter of that Borchers was no better, but
he received a support which. In compar
ison with that bestowed upon Babbitt, was
like Paradise to the nethermost recesses
of the torrid place below. Moore and
Courtney were the arch offenders.
Stockton played with more or less ab
sence of luck, especially in the flffh, when,
after making three hits, not a man could
be shoved over the rubber.

MAJORITY OF
GAMES TAKEN
BY THE DUDES
With Saturday's rundown furnishing
good all-round coursing and the contest
ing hounds In yesterday's finals running
close up to top form, the big 123-dog open
stake offered by the Union Park manage
ment as the â¢week's event can go on rec
ord as the equal of any of this season's
attractions. The hares, like those of the
previous day, put the dogs to severe tests,
and though there Â¦were not many escapes
recorded relief dogs were turned loose
quite often. .
Palo Alto, the incendiary, set fire to
great bulks of money in his course with
Iowa Maid.- Geary's celebrated flier has
two first-class reputationsâ as a sprinter
and as a hesitator. With 8 to 1 quoted In
his favor the fast son of Kmin Pasha al
lowed the Maid.tolscore the kill and even
up points on him, when he could have won
In easy style If he had not hesitated. In
the run-off tt was the same old story â had
her beaten but would not pick up the
game.
Curtis & Sons' Narcissus played against
coursing luck. In the second round he
went the limit In a go with Gold Nugget,
in which he showed himself possessed of
the necessary qualities of a stake winner.
A hard hare full of tricks worried the
game dog to a finish and made the work
doubly severe. The punishing test told on
Narcissus and he was withdrawn. Consid
ering the great form he displayed it was
a certainty, that Narcissus would have
been an important factor at the finish.
F. A. McComb's Little Sister won the
deciding course from P. J. Reilly's Royal
Union. Both dogs showed well through
out the stake. In a bye with Twin City
Girl in the third round Union went up
against a hard course, which undoubtedly
hurt his chances in the final. Against Mc-
Comb's fast hound he showed the effects
of hard going in the early part of the
course, but picked up and was doing good
work when he scored the kill, leaving Lit
tle Sister three points ahead of him.
It was a Rood day for the favorites,
though the few short ends which landed
were at average good odd3. Miss Ellen
was kind to her backers, getting the flag
twice when the odds were five to one
against her. Rocker did well and reached

ALAMEDA. Nov. 4.â Alameda's
next big amusement affair, to
follow the recent event of the
ladles' minstrel company, will
be the annual vaudeville en
tertainment to be given in Armory Hall
on Friday evening, the 9th inst., under
the management of the Alameda Boating
Club. All former shows put on by the
local oarsmen have drawn Immense
crowds, and theÂ«high class programmes
rendered have established a reputation
for the boating club in the entertainment
line that Is second to none In this city.
Already the sale of tickets has been large,
and before Friday evening it is expected
of his special skits. Arnold Grazer and
Helen Callaghan, who are soon to go on
the Orpheum circuit, will sing and dance.
Popular songs and fresh stories will be

leln brothers of the Olympic Club are to
fence, and there will be two. four-round
sparring matches by boxers from the
same club. An orchestra of ten pieces,
under the leadership of Miss Sadie Rice,
will furnish music.
The boatlnp club committee in charge ot
the vaudeville show consists of W. B.
Hinchman. Theodore Eisfeldt, Fred S.
Cone. Charles Â«H. Smith. George H. Miller
and John A. Hammersmith. The last

that standing room will be at a premium.
Among the executants on the prog
ramme Is Miss Maud Fay, a soprano of
exceptional promise. She has a voice of
remarkable purity and sweetness, with a
carrying- quality that Is always effective.
Miss Fay's splendid presence Is another
advantage, which has contributed much to
her success as a vocalist. George Ham
mersmith of this city, who has by his
clever work in specialties become" the
vogue among the cluba and In amateur
performances, will produce an original
travesty on "Sapho." Clinton R. Morse

from the etage, and with a remark that
he might possibly be seen at the hall
next Sunday night, but that as it was a
long way off and he mieht go somewhero
elsÂ« before then, he retired.
He invited all those who were sick to
Ftep upon the stage and he would deliver
the goods; but he scratched all those who
were lame or blind. One negro ascended
the Rtage, and was shortly followed by a
gentleman with a long white beard, who
said he Teas not sick, but "would like to
take a chance." Two ladles also sum
moned enouph courage to go up and bo
healed. The negro was barred because
he was lame and the rentleman received
a hfarty shake of the hand. He waa
asked afterward how he felt, and with a
knowing wink he said: "I feel quite well,
thank you." The ladies were more en
thusiastic, and eaid they felt much bet
tpr.
Schlatter "looked like money" when he
stepped upon the stage and made a stiff
bow to the audience. He commenced fRe
evening's entertainment with a long ad
dress about his being a "grand piece of
work," but the forty-seven members of
the audience began to get restless and
shuffle their feet, so with a few more
bouquets at himself he settled down to
business.
Forty-seven people paid a quarter of a
dollar last evening to see Schlatter in
his great act of "healing- the 5ick on the
platform." The affair was very tame,
and one disgruntled member of the
audience, on leaving Hoover Hall, where
the exhibition took place, remarked that
he did not get a run for his money.

makes htm a. responsible agent: elves him
volition, the power of choice and recognizes
him as a freeman. Cattle do not vote, be
caute they have no intelligent will. The

capable of saying yÂ«s and no.
We are approaching a national election and
the people are to vote for a President, for
principles and measures. It Is a picturesque
and dramatic proceeding, this national elec
tion. We, are reminded again that we are
the people, and the people are the govern
ment. The ballot is the plain man's weapon
and ever)' man's prerogative. In this Â«he*t
of paper is the spirit of American democracy.
I do not mean to tell you how to vote; that
is one thing the minister is not permitted to
do, but he can tell you to vote^ â to use the
ballot and seize the opportunity of being a
part of this great Government. A man may
I've in America and still not be a citizen. A
man is a citizen when he claim* his citizen
ship by the use of the ballot. The man who
does not vote has no business to nnd fault
with the results of this election. lie is only
"a. looker on in Venice."
The Rev. William Rader preached an
able sermon on the topic of "The Man and
the\ Vote" at the Third Congregational
Church last night. The preacher drew a
parallel between the ancient method of
decision by popular acclamation and the
modern system of voting by ballot. Con
tinuing, he said in part:
Social Conditions Wielded by
the Ballot.

Richard invented by Shakespeare is born
into a land of blood and intrigue. The
:rown is the best thing in life. To attain
t women become mere pawns on a chess
board and men are of no moment when
they stand before It. Richard is con
scious of his mental strength and too
conscious of his physical deformity. He
is skilled in all the arts of his time, and
tils very uncouthness has determined him
The principal character In "Richard
III"â representing unbounded ambitionâ
is what the dramatic- critic calls a "star"
part, consequently Ihe drama which holds
it is better known to the general public
than others, like "Measure for Measure,"
which are much more characteristic of
the great master's genius. It is oftener
played and consequently better known
through the curtailed acting edition than
through the full text. It bas all Shakes
peare's early faults,, which were the
faults of that Elizabethan school of
which Marlowe was the chief. Professor
Dowden names It second in the croup
which shows Marlowe's influence. The
date of the composition of the play is put
about the year 1594.
An examination of any typical drama
by Marlowe^ â "Faustae" or "Tambur
laine" for Instanceâ will show the cha-
acterlstics which one easily dlscmrers" in
"Richard III." There is a central pas
sion and a central figure, and all other
characters and events are mere acces
sories of the prime passion and figure.
There is no development of character;
there Is much evil, undiminished by hu
man tenderness, small sympathy with
humanity, a profusion of grandiloquence
and little of that fear as to the probable
danger of bad actions which even the
greatest villains are subject to. Permit
me to recommend to the busy reader, for
the higher appreciation of Shakespeare
by comparison, "The Best Elizabethan
Plays," by William Roscoe Thayer. It
contains "The Jew of Malta," by Mar
lowo, which may well be read compara
tively with "The Merchant of Venice."
Shakespeare's "Richard III" follows,
historically, Sir Thomas More and Hol-
Inshed's "Chronicle." It does not do tho
real Richard justice. It would be as un
just to take without reserve the char
acter of Caesar as painted by Suetonius
as to assume that the gTeat Yorkist,
Richard, should be fairly presented by tho
Lancastrians, whose traditions Sir
Thomas adopted in eood faith. It is a
fallacy to imagine that Shakespeare's
"Historical Plays" are history in our
modern sense, or that they are to be
taken as such. They embodied tne tradi
tional view of historical characters taken
in England late in the sixteenth century.
And Shakespeare presented to his coun
trymen the episodes as he found them,
changing and elaborating as the theatri
cal demands of the time required. Facts
to him were material. His theater could
not afford the means of offering a splen
did pageant to the eye. He made up for It
by flooding' the ear with mellifluous
words. His historical plays stand apart;
as a rule they are not dramatic, they are
declamatory and rhetoricalâ "contests in
oratory," somebody has calleu them â in
which one or two SDeakers take alter
nately the front of the stage and try the
effect of blank verse upon the hearers.
The character of Richard of Gloucester
as depicted by Shakespeare does not
grow. From the beginning- of the play
we find him strong-willed, intellectual,
masterful in resources, looking at hu
manity as his tool. Those critics who wlil
insist on comparing one species with an
other rate "Richard III" unfairly when
they compare it to "Othello" or "Mac
beth." An artist must be Judged by the
object he wants to attain and the inten
tion of Shakespeare in "Richard III" is
evidently very different from what it is
In either "Othello" or "Macbeth." The

Either heaven with lightning strike th* mur

AÂ» thou dost swallow up this rood king's blood.
Which his hel!-gr>vern'(l arm hath butchered.
And later she cries out:
O wonderful wfaea derlls tell tit* trots.
Gloucester's retort Is:
More wonderful when anr^ts Â«irÂ» so angry.
And when she recounts his murderous
deeds, he answers:
Your beauty was the catwe of that affect;
Tour beauty which did haunt me In my s!eÂ«p
To undertake the death of all the world.

He finds that he can be a lover, but
does not love.- He determines that Anno

ecy that comes of perfect self-control.
He sees the end because he has no scru

he is of the vulnerability of those who

with a quibble; In act 1, scene 3, she
cries:

Thou that wast nealed in thy nativity
The slave of nature and tlie son of hell!
Thou rag of honor! thoti detested
Here the Duke calmly says:
Margaret.
The curse Is turned upon herself. The
murder of Clarence with the assassin's
climax, "Look behind you, my lord!" is
one of the really . dramatic passages of
the play. The introduction of the two
children of the murdered Clarence givine:
additional corroboration of Richard's
treachery Is marred by the revengeful
ness of the children. It is true to th<i
spirit of the time when revenge seemed
to be looked on as a duty of the individ
ual, sine* each man was for himself and
organized society was beginning to
emerge from chaos.

for Richard only fears when he is

But, as Richard's wife, she must be

4, where the wretched Duchess of York,
mother of Richard, bereft by him of two
sons, and the utterly wretched Queens,
drawn together only by their mrrows â
which have not softened them â sit down
together, we have a dramatic culmination
entirely worthy of Shakespeare, Margaret
is implacable, and our sympathies aro
with the Duchess of York when she asks,
somewhat weary of Margaret's constant
curses:
Why should calamity bÂ« foil of words?
To which Queen Elizabeth replies:
Windy attorneys to their silent woes.

Poor breathinar orators of miseries!

most musically set in Shakespeare's ca
dencesâyields up her daughter, and Rich
ard cynicallv thinks:

Richard's worst enemy lies In his own
mind. He has killed all scruples; by day
light he is the all-compelling one: at
night sleep unnerves him. Ills conscience
breaks from his control; he is half asleep
when, after his fearful dream, he calls
out:
Have mercy. Jasat

He adds as the ghost dream passes:
There is no creature loves me;
And if I die no soul shall pity ma.

"Richard III" certainly Is. And yet It
is a truly great and artistic Interpreta

deliberately chooses evil, not aa its good,

turned homeward and by 4 o'clock the
park wa3 practically deserted. No ac

A large crowd, considering the weather,
assembled at the Chutes and enjoyed the

CYCLIST RUNS
INTO A BUGGY
Harley Noyes * Fractures
His Skull and Receives
Other Wounds.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 4.
While scorching on his wheel along the
San Leandro road this morning Harley
Noyes, who was to have' represented the
Capital City "Wheelmen In the California
Associated Cyclers' annual road race, ran
Into a buggy and was seriously If not
fatally Injured. Noyes now lies at the
Receiving Hospital with a fraoture of the
skull at the base of the brain, his right
ear nearly torn off and numerous bruises
about the body. The hospital physicians
are awaiting developments before oper
ating upon him.
Noyes, accompanied by John Posch, an
other cyclist, arrived from Sacramento
this morning at Fruitvale station and
started out on their wheels to inspect the
course for the ten-mile road race. After
going out on the county road for a. mile
or more they turned and started to come
back to the starting point at High street.
Posch was leading and Noyes was imme
diately behind him.
When the riders arrived opposite one of
the crossroads they met a buggy which
was being driven by an Italian. Without
warning the driver of the rig made a sud
den turn into, the crossroad. Posch just
got out of the way In time, but Noyes cRd
not see the buggy and ran directly into
it, striking the right rear wheel with great
force. The right side of his head struck
against the tire of the wheel and he fell
like a log. â¢ He was picked up In an un
conscious condition by his companion and
several other cyclists who witnessed the
accident. .
The wounded man was placed aboard
the first electric car that came along and
was taken to Thirteenth and Washington
streets, whence he was removed in an am
bulance to the Receiving Hospital.
"Noyes must have had his head turned
the other way, judging from the way he
was struck," Â»aid the wounded cyclist's
companion. "He was close behind me and
we were going pretty fast. It was all I
could do to get out of the way of the man
in the buggy, and Noyes was so close to
me that he could not have seen his dan
ger. : We did not have any idea the Italian
was going, to turn into that road, or we
would have been prepared."
that he is "false and treacherous" and
prepares to make the devil serve him.
Like Autolycus, "As for the life to come,
he sleeps out tho thought of it." In spite
of his hideousness of mien, he persuades
Anne and Elizabeth into belief In him,
after he has done things almost too mon
strous for belief. There are sneers and
grins in his thoughts whenever he proves
humanity weak or foolish. And human
ity, whenever it comes in contact with
this arch-hypocrite, is impossibly weak
and foolish. It is true that Anne of War
wick married Richard after his party had
killed her father and her husband, the
Lancastrian Crown Prince, but not after
such an impossible wooing. It was a mat
ter of political arrangement. It is true
that the young Elizabeth of York wa*
sent to Richard's court and that he In
tended to marry her as' soon as Anne
should die. He promised the ambitious
young Elizabeth â who longed for a crown
â that Anne could not live beyond* Febru
ary 14S5. She did die at the age of 37, and
there were suspicions. Elizabeth, after
Bosworth, for reasons of state, married
Henry VII. Richard had intended her at
first for his son. who died; he was only
prevented from marrying her by the- pro
tests of his counselors. The wooing of
Lady Anne and the yielding of Queen
Elizabeth, under the circumstances of the
play, which confirm Richard's belief In
the weakness of women, are Inventions.
Richard was not looked on as entirely
responsible for the excesses of the Tork
lstn. There Is even a doubt as to h!s part
in the murder of the two young Princes.
For us the legitimate interest in "Rich
ard III" lies in its- psychological and lit
erary rather than in Us historical aspect.
We must admit that the character of
Richard does not develop; -that he shows
no signs of kindliness and only one touch
of self-pity:
There Ii no creature lores me, .
And If I die no soul will pity ran.
"We know, too, that he does not deceive
himself; he is honest in his own thoughts,
while to this world he Is a consummate
hypocrltfe. What, then Is the charm about
him? He is deformed, his observation has
convinced him that he cannot be a lover
he deliberately turns a fine mind to the
accomplishment of the most atrocious
wickedness: he is even mean. Why do we
tolerate him. then? "The woolngr of Lady
Anne by Richard." Professor Fumlvall
says in his remarkable preface to the
"Leopold Shakespeare." "has stirred me
to reading It aloud almost as much as
anything in Shakespeare." The truth is
Richard is not a monster: he is as human
as Milton's Satan, but never humane.
The women in the playâ Queen Marga
ret, Lady Anne. Elizabeth, the Duchess of
Yorkâ are termagants. Least of all have
they any touch of that tender, pathetic
reticence that accompanies all Shakes
peare's best women. Anne rants with al
most the bombast of the Intolerable Mar
garet, her mothtr-ln-law. She exclaims:

CRITICAL STUDY OF "RICHARD III."
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
Siontee has displayed no suicidal mania nor
has he shown any desire to harm any one since
being at the institution. At different tiroes,
however, when things do not go as he thinks
fuey should he butts his h*ad against the floor
and walU. These arts are attributed to ine
fact that he has no Intellect and docs not know
any better. His case is a remarkable one and
It will take time and the stud}- of physicians
to comprehend It fully. At present the child
is undergoing no special treatment.
There ts hardly any hope as to further proper
development of the lad's mind. There may be
some change when Montee grows elder, but
this is hardly possible. He !s in the hands of
experienced attendants and Is friven every care
possible. This is what he BMdl ar.d he is not
v<ry troublesome. His speech is Just the sams
as when he was admitted to thÂ» asylum, Just
a rumbling pound, ard thfre 1? no hiipe of his
ever belnr able to talk. The lad can compre
hend an idea when told to pet something if
the same ie pointed out to him.
NAPA, Nov. S. â Just one month aso to-day
Montee Ledderhos of San Francisco, a four
year-cld boy. was received at the Napa. State
Hofpltal for the Insane. He was comrnUtrd to
this institution on account of a homicidal
mania that was displayed In his disposition
and the belief thai an asylum was the proper
place fcr him. Since Mnntee's arrival at the
Napa institution he has attracted the atten
tion of physicians nnd attendants hen?. The.
lift!* fellow wan placed In the receiving ward
in the female part of the institution ar.d is
getting Hlongr nicely. He is m Dr. Dczier's
cere, and that physician says that the little
fellow Is not a mar.'tae. as has previously been
reported :n the prese. hut a degenerate, hav-
JriB been born imperfect.
The condition cf the lad has not im
proved any, as the following dispatch
shows:
The death of Mrs. Ledderhcs was a
| particularly sad one. She was the mother
j of Montee Ledderhos, the four-year-o.-l
! maniac who was sent to the asylum at
: Napa a short time agt>. During his entire
life the child was a source of trouble
and anxiety to the loving mother, ana
she finally broke down under the strain.
j At the time of his commitment to tho
I asylum she was an inmate of St. Winlr
I fr^d's Hospital. Her condition at that
; time was such that the news was with
| held from her. She gained in strength
' and at a fitting time was toid of the fate
! of her boy. The shock was too much aad
I 6he suffered a relapse, from which sho
! never recovered.
Following the stricken husband and
motherless children came the brothers
and sisters of the deceased, weeping- bit
ter t<Â»ars. The eyes of the friends at
tending the funeral, moistened at the sad
sight, and many a tear was wiped away
furtively by strong men. At the house
the funeral service of the Companions
of the Forest was read. From the deso
late home the funeral cortege wended its
way to St_ Boniface's Church, where- the
funeral service of the Catholic Church
was rÂ«ad. From there the funeral pio-
CGeded to Calvary Cemetery, where tho
last sad rites were performed. Tho many
beautiful floral pieces sent by sympathetic
friends coverwi the freshly made mound.
Literally covered with flowers was the
casket that was carried ytPr^rday from
the home of Theodore Ledderhos at 6
Golden p'.ace. The renjains within the
coffin were those of a loving wife and
mother, and the sorrowful 'mien of the
epectators as the remains were reveren
tially placed in the hearse was mute tes
timony of the sympathy l'clt by them.

The actual consideration in other sales
was as follows:
There were ninety-flve deeds placed on
record during the week. The transactions
were small in dearly all instances. The
larger transfers were the following':
ThÂ«rÂ« continues to be a fair demand for
business properties, which demand will be like
ly to Increase three or four fold after the eleo
tlon. Th* demand for lots for manufacturing
and warehouse business continues. For sev
eral months that demand has been larger than
evor before in the history of the city. All the
signs Indicate that, after tho election, there
will be a very good real estate market, with
advancing prices. For residence purposes, land
on Padflo Heights continues to be in tlje lead,
and as next best, lots between Vallejo and
Union streets, commanding a view of the bay,
are inquired after by peopla who cannot afford
to buy Pacific Heights property. There ls a
continued demand for property below Market
street for wholesale business. .^- -

Solemn benediction was then celebrated
by Father Scanlan, at the close of which
his Grace made a strong appeal in the
cause of temperance, and at his request
all the boys stood up and took the League
of theÂ» Cross pledge to abstain from ail
alcoholic liquors and not to enter a sa
loon before they become 21. The follow
ing were confirmed:
My Dear Children: It is. a very pleasing sight
to me to see such a large class for confirmation,
and I do hone that this is a day that will be
never forgotten by you all. I want to impress
on all parents to lead Christian lives. If your
children see you going to communion, if they
rnse that you love and respect your religion,
they will also grovr up good ' Catholics. The
way to live a holy life is by copying some one
as an example. What life can we better at
tempt to live up to than that of our blessed
Lord. I confirmed a large class this morning,'
and how I wish and do hope that all the chil
dren I confirm to-day will grow up good- and
stanch Catholics, and thus be a strong support
to our holy church.
At 4 o'clock his Grace, attended by
a large number of the prominent clergy
of the city, entered the sanctuary. The

Whose Baby Are You?" is destined to
rival in its popularity the author's better
known "Brown's in Town."
The Plot of the play Is of .respectable
and ancient lineageâ none of your imper
tinent novelties or doubtful innovations
but Just an old reliable re-hash of once
used-always-used material of the best.
The bachelor artist with a baby of prob

it s and his various adventures before the
child reaches its own nappy home are
the materials out of which the clever au
thor has evolved a sparkling, most mirth
provoking and altogether enjovable farce
comedy.
MME. >IELBA arrived In # this
city yesterday morning to Join
forces with the Maurice Grau
Opera- Company, which is to
play an important engage
ment at the Grand Opera House beginning
next week. The diva is the picture of
health and contentment and came direct
from London, fresh from her European
conquests in the operatic field. She is ac
companied by her sister, Miss Mitchell,
who tt seems is not endowed with the
vocal gifts that have been showered on
her more favored relative. Melba took
pains to assure The Call's representative
that Miss Mitchell is not an operatic star
like herself.
"She's a lady, she's not a singer," said
tho diva naively.
The ladies have, engaged aoartments at
the Palace, where they will be domiciled
during the Grau engagement.
Melba expressed herself as being pleased
to be in San Francisco once more, which,
next to London, she said was her favorite
city. This morning she will leave for Bur
lingame, where she will be the guest of
}^Â° Â£Â°*. ina and Martins for a few days,
on Wednesday morning: she will proceed
itii j S An eeles, where tho company is
billed to sing on Friday night. She will
return to this city on Saturday to pre
pare for the opening of the season in
Komeo et Juliette" next ilondav. The
famous singer pleaded fatigue after her
long journey, but graciously condescended
to ,, T a n interview when seen at the hotel.
I have come here directly from Lon
don, said Melba. "and I assure you that
I am heartily tired after the fortnight's
trip. 1 was seasick and trainsick all the
way and I cannot express my delight at
Being stationary once more, and especial

"1 have had an unusually gratifying suc
cess in Holland, Austria and Germany,
and my. triumphs I am afraid have quite

of no particular interest to any one ex
cept myself.
"1 am especially pleased that I am to
commence my season â¢ here as Juliette.
That is a role which I dearly love, and
l consider myself as very fortunate in
having studied it with Gounod."
Â», i n *" n La Dlva was asked whether she
had posed recently for any new photo
graphs of her charming self, she gave
a little shrug of her shoulders and said
poutingly:
"I have decided that I will have no more
photographs taken of myself. This con
stant posing becomes monotonous. It is
very tiresome to take a million wigs and
a million costumes to the photographer
and after being pulled and hauled this
way and that to ilnd that the results are
far from desirable. I had the last pic

were so wretched that I gave immediate
