For generations those persons whoat
homes have been near Mount Vesuvius
have piously believed that the fury of aa
eruption could be much mitigated by the
prayers to the Almighty, and that those
would be in the least danger who could
congregate In % some consecrated spot.
When the terrible eruption began la 1831
Cardinal Buoytcarnpagno went In state to
the chapel near the mountain and offered
np prayers. In the hope of appeasing; God's
wrath.- " "-"
A great religious procession was held at
the same time, and wnen It was over
thousands gathered In all the, - chapels
within view of the mountain, declaring
their determination to die there If death
were Inevitable. The Governor of the dis
trict and 500 persons had fled for safety
to a large building opposite the Francis
can chapel, in this little town of Torre del
Greco, while others had poured Into the
chapel until It was packed to the very
door. Hardly had they entered when,
burning lava poured down the street and.
Â¦wept to destruction the Governor and
his companion?.
.. A terrible time it v/as. but the fact re
mains that those who sought shelter in
the Franciscan chapel were saved, whllo
hundreds of others lost their lives; and
The maimed survivor of the duel went
to a far country. But Delnna was never
quite the same, though time somewha^
Dclfna. Lopez did not have the usual
swect-slxtccn souvenirs of her first ball
to take away In a treasure box. She
â¢cratched her hands pulling the drooping
roseÂ« from her hair and tearing off th*
crlmson-splashf-d gown, she threw them
Into the fire. "Maria Santlsslma! an ill
omen, an 111 omen." cackled' the old nurse
as the flames easily swallowed' the, blood
ftalned Â£auze.

the light of cor^uest no longer shone In
her eyes. She wan blameless, yet out
there in the growing daylight they were
filC&lng a grave; while inside thÂ« doctor
irravely shook his head over thjp wounded

her favor. They gave each other the He.
Down on the Rio Grande there is but one
way to wipe out such an insult. The
quick, sharp report of a pistol arrested
the Cancers: the flash of a bowie-knife cat
through the air. Then a wild screas*
rhlvered the silence into bits. It was Del
flna. ----;â¢' Â¦
It was on her sixteenth birthday that
Delflna went to her first ball, there to
learn her fatal charms. She was an
fragrant ar.d sweet as a Castlllan rose, all
!n a gown cf Cimsy white. Her thick, eoft
hair, with its red rose*. Just tossed in a
knot and falling loose again, was her only
mantilla, Her beauty was compelling and
men quarreled for the privilege of danc
ir.g with her.
But even In her early teens the boys
Quarreled over her and many were the
boyish "scraps" for "Delflnlta." The
years added to her loveliness. At 16 she
was ravlsrJr.gly beautiful, with the lithe,
languorous grace of the south. Once her
long lashes drooped over laughing eyes,
but now something of tho tragic has crept
trnfler them.
The Serorlta Delnna is guiltless of even
a drop of the Mood that has been shed on
her account. She Is not a Clre<5 who will
ingly wooÂ« men's souls to the brink of
eln. Her heart does not thirst for mur
der.
What girl this side of the Rio Grande
can claim tho questionable distinction of
having r*?en the indirect cause of four
deaths? Eenorita Delfina Lopez has yet
another proof of her fatal powers of fas
cination. A young man. maimed for life
by a thrust of tfc* bowie-knife, hobbles
around, a crippled testimony to her en

WHERE are you going, my pretty
maid?"
"To bury four lovers, sir," she
said.
"won't you marry me, xny pretty maid?"
"I'd rather jou'd die for me, elr," she
said.
The other day two young Spaniards of
5Cew Mexico fought a duel over Senorlta
Delflna LÂ«opez. the belle and beauty of the
Rio Grar.de. Valley. They met at noon,
and In the shadows of nightfall their
bodies were lowered into the freshly

They were young men of good standing,
and moreover were distantly connected.

As nearly as the romance of her Ufa
can be made, frcrn the simple little state
ments of fact which Fhe has given, it Is
this:
Georg-e Carmack. the flret white man to
bring gold out of the Klondike, had lived
his early life in San Benlto County, near
vrhrrc the gr<Â»at mines of New Idrla pour
unending streams of quicksilver day and
riprht from thieir furnaces. He formed a
taste for mining, and with the InBtinct of
the true prospector went to look for gold,
not whÂ«Â»re it was known to be, but where
it was unknown. He went to 'Alaska in
JS?6 and traded, hunted and -fished as all
of the white men of that country did, but
always with eyes and cars open for stories
of the gold that he knew the Indians
could tell If they would. An Indian is"
wiser than he looks and his ellence Is,
less often than we think, the reticence of
wisdom rather than tha dumbness of
stupidity.
She has filed a complaint for divorce
apainst hor husband, and yet she does not
realize what it is that she has done.
That is rrierHy because she is' an Indian,
and the eubtleUes of our courts of equity
are beyond her comprehension. What
the does know is that ebe wants . her
husband to come back and be Â¦with her
end she wants her child.
Her telling ha* not been clear, for she
does not speak English 'well and no one
there understands tbe language of her
people.

â¢woman who showed the gold of the Klon
dike to George Carmack, according to tha
Etory which ehe tells.
In the town of Holllster, San Benlto
County, lives Indian Kate Carmack, the
HERE Is a story about tons of gold;
a. real true Etory , and trfie gold ;
you can see It yourself in the mint
at San Francisco.
An Indian maiden, faithful arid true,
who ehowed the cold to her paleface lover
that she might win him forever to her
heart; that is her picture as she la now
with her little daughter.
And then the Inevitable mysterious lady.
Two of them in this case. The kind that
you read about in books, 'who always hap
pen In at the strangest times, from no one
knows where; or else from some far-away
corner of a forgotten land. These ladles,
like all things mysterious, you must take
more or less on faith, but In return for
your credence you have liberty to weave a
few fancies of your own concerning them.
Whether, for Instance, It Is the man or
the gold for which they contend.
The sight was well worth the money in
Carmack'3 opinion, but his timid brown
wife was frightened to think of the awful
power of. the gold which she had shown
the palefaces; terrified by the force of
evil in that yellow metal which had lain,
so preitily under the moss and yet made
the proud wMte man fight as her father's
sl^i dogs fought over the :drie<3 salmon
when the snow was on the ground in the
long night at home. *
â¢ - ' . â¢ Â¦' ,
Carmack did not run away and leave
his Indian wife as her. brothers had tql-1
herfhe would. She was still pretty and
her 'smite was like the smile-^well, you
know; t*e smile that a man gets from
the woman who loves him. Then, too,
she had saved his life and found him a
fortune. So together they* went to the
land of the sun; he. pleased to show her
the. wonders which her simple language
could not describe; she, proud to be seen
with her big Handsome white husband.
â¢ Carmack was generous and good-heart
ed. He bought things until the salesmen
held their breaths. There was not any
thing good enough for Kate.- A hundred
dollar doll was good enough for their lit
tle daughter Graffle, because any doll la
good enough for a girl even If It is only
a stick of wood with a shawl wrapped
about it.
But Carmack had too much money, and
with that sense of honest generosity
which Is now so scarce he felt that it was
his duty to act a3 distributor of the bless
ings which tHe treasure king of the north
had showered upon him. He gathered his
family about him at the hotel window in
Seattle and threw money by the handful
Into the crowds below. That was a sight
which made him laugh. Newsboys
dropped papers in the mud and fought and
clawed in the slime of the street as pigs
grovel and root for corn in the barnyard.
Merchsjits.left their shops, which might
have been pillaged but that every one
was like themselves, in the midst of the
furious football rush that surged,
scratched and slid around like wolves
over a bone. Motcrmen and conductors
as well as passengers Jumped from the
car3, which were left to stand while the
five-dollar pieces and silver coins fell from
above. The police who were sent to dis
perse the crowd Joined In the scramble
and swelled the mob which -they should
have rcattered. Men came out of that
Jam with suits destroyed and gold in their
hands. ."
if once he go* enough of it he wottid
leave her 'and' go away forever to his
own'' people.' ->' , Â¦ .' -â¢Â»'>- "^
But she loved him and that was enough.
She could not see him unhappy, and. one
day an excursion was planned that would
lead. them to the place where the moesea
trailed over golden sands and the waters
of -the rippling creek looked like Chabli*
as they took alternately the color of the
moss and gold on wh'ich they .ran.;
- That was an eventful ' day. Carmack
looked at if one way, Skookum Jim and
Tagish â¢ Charley had a different view.
They knew that now the greed of the
white man would be limited only by tha
finding of the last grain of gold In the
creeks;- that- the treasure house which
.would have lasted their moderate people
until the end of time would be rifled in
the space of a few months or years, and
that with it would go all of the food re
sources of the wilderness. -- â¢
Skookum Jim and -Tagish Charley did
not want to file. claims. They felt that
they owned the whole creek and did not
care to be limited to~the BOO feet that
the law allowed.' but Carmacksaw that
their rights Â«ere secured and then they
began to scoop out gold. It was in that
creek by tons and the three pioneers got
their share. â¢ . Â»
The romance has only commenced to
unfold, but the brew la mixed, and when
the trial of this, California's last and ap>
parent Iy most sensational divorce suit,
makes the facts public, there will be good
reading for those who are interested in
mysterious ladles, loving Indian girls and
tons cf gold, about which the fight re
volves. Kate Carmack wondered to see
the whites struggling in the muddy streets
of Seattle for the fists full of gold. Now
tho Is herself In the midst of a scramble.
There must be In the woman's heart a
great longing to be back in her own coun
try with her own Â¦ people, but as the
hunter lures the doe away from the forest
by carrying her fawn, so Knte Carmack
stays about where her daughter bides.
She has much to think of on those long
rides. Of the time when she found her
fate in the shape of the handsome white
man lying exhausted by the Arctic river,
of their idyllic life while she alone knew
of it. and kept her living: treasure hid
den, sheltered and provided for. Of the
Joy which she gave him when she showed
him the greatest known wealth on earth.
And turning from that to the dark time*
of the present when he Is away with
strangers who surround him for the gold;
and saddest thought of all perhaps, that
her little bMwn-eyed daughter has more
of the father than of herself in disposition
and forgets her Indian mother In tho
ways of the white people.
The only pleasure left to Indian Kate,
the only Joy which the ways of the whito
man have given her. Is her bicycle, on
which she takes solitary rides through the
mountains of the coast range.
The child, too. with that peculiar un
happy disposition which often shows In
persons of mixed race, cares little for the
mother who adores her and is better
pleased to stay with her father's rela
tives.
In the meantime the sister of Mr. Car
mack, with whom his wife had been lJv
lngr. feels that she should not give shelter
and comfort to tha enemy, and has asked
Indian Kate to betake herself to other
parts. Whether or not Kate understands,
she. at least does not obey, for all .day
lon^. like a fond dog, sha hangs about
the house where her daughter Graffle Is
still kept, and only leaves at night when
she is driven to go to. a neighbor's to
sleep.
What the motive of the lady from Daw
son was she told no one, and the only,
clew to It Is that she has a grievance
against a certain woman in Seattle who
Is named in the complaint for divorce as
a corespondent. It Is alleged by the lady
from Dawson that a diamond was stolen
from her by this Seattle person, which
shows that they have met before, and
there may ba other reasons than that of
the missing diamond which prompt her
to make a 6000-mile trip for the purpose
of taking such an active Interest In fight
ing the battles of the lonely Indian who
does, not even realize what It Is all about.
"There was a woman," eta
Also from the north; all the way tress
Dawson, came a stranga lady, who took
the affairs of Mrs. Carmack In her hands
and proceeded to assist her In petting the
forces of the law in operation for the
purpose of compelling George Carrnacft to.
give one-half of his property to his wife.
. So affairs might have gone had It not
been that one day came from tha north*

CLARA PREXTTCE started out in
life as the daughter of a grocery
man, and a small grocerynian at
that. She is now the Princess
Hatzfeldt-Wi'denberg:. heir to a million
California dollars and to one of the most
ancient names cf Germany's aristocracy.
This Js another wonder for which Ccllis
P. Hunting-ton is rcFponsibie.
He was rot satisfied with making a rail
road out of ah Indian trail and a fortune
out of poverty, bat he must needs make
a Princ^t* out of a. grocer's little girl.
In 1Â«C1 there was living in Sacramento
a man named Edward Prentice. He kept
a little grocery store, and the neighboring
housewives used to drop In every morn
ir.g and order soap ajia sard'nes and su
gar and have the account thereof written
in the little bocks which they carried.
Mr. Prentice was only the grocer, they
would have told you; they never thought
much about him. He was only the gro
cer. His daughter marry a Prince?
What do you suppose the good old Sac
ramestans of that day would have eald
to him If he had announced that his
daughter would or.e day marry a Prince?
They would have thought him a fit in
mate for the State lunatic asyluin.
It was In the year 1S61 that his daugh
ter Clara was born. In 1 "J came the Sac
rarsento Valley flood ..at carried away
men and women and thllOren and ruined
homes and left fiirastcr everywhere that
it passed. Edward Prentice was drowned
In It.
There followed grievous distress In his
family. The little grocery had been bare
ly more than a struggle at best and its
owner had saved nothing from Its Income.
He hajl preached a. suf3cient-unto-the-day
doctrine all his life, probably because It
was the otly one he could afford to prac
tice, acd had been unable to take thought
for thaanorrow; and now the morrow had
come and It seemed quite staggered by
the demand that it take thought for the
things of Itself.
What waj! Mrs. Prentice to do, ehe won

children? Two of them, a boy and a girl,
and the things they needed, from shoes
to bat and back again, were more than

After some months of this*sort of thing

took a fancy to the small Clara and de-

clded unoji anything It meant business.
HIs wife was r sister of Mrs. Prentice,
making him an uncle by marriage of the
little girl. She had always been around
a gr?at deal, and her uncle had grown
used to seeing lier. and he missed her if

more and more, and when she had the

It was not long after Clara recovered

Then followed a process of unlearning
what had already been learned. Clara
was to be no longer a Prentice, but a
Huntington. Mrs. Prentice was to be
"auntie-; Edward, the brother, who had
stolen her rattle and Tea ner peppermints,
was to be "cousin." There, was a new
papa, a new mamma, and it- was all
changed.
- Everybody was warned and mads to
promise that not a word of Clara's birth
should be breathed in her presence. Ser
vants kept still, children kept still, no
body told. The little girl saw her "auntie-

much, but. of course, "mamma" was
mamma. The Hur.tlngton home was hers,
she was growing up as a part of it.

to have a French lesson respectably

the thought, perhaps, that this woman
had let her own child bÂ« taken -from her

whole plan suggests monastldsr&r. It
can readily be understood why no definite
cause for the monastic institution can bÂ»
given and no date assigned for its
origin. It did not commence at any fixed
time and definite- place. Various philos
ophies and religious customs traveled In
centuries from country to country, re
sulting in similar resemblances and dif
ferences between different ascetic or
monastic sects.
It would be imoossible in the space
available to give any more than a brief
scope of Mr. WIshart's work. In con
sidering the effects of monasticism he
finally concludes:
"Monastic forms and vows may pass
away with other systems thit will have
their day, but its fervor of faith an4 its
warfare- against human passion and hu
man â¢ creed, its child-like love of the
heavenly kingdom will nevtr die. Th<3
revolt against its superstitions and ex
cesses is justifiable only in a society that
recks to actualize its j underlying re
ligious ideal of personal purity and social
service." (Published oy Albert Brandt,

The monk is a type of religious char
acter by no means peculiar to Christian
ity. Every great religion in ancient and
modern times has expressed itself in somÂ«
form of monastic life. The* origin of
the Institution is lost in antiquity. India
Is thought by some to have been Ht
birthplace. In that rour.try there existed,
centuries before the Christian era. both
phases of Christian monaaticism â the
hermit and the crowded convent. Amon*
the Greeks there were pany philosophers
who taught ascetic principles. Pytha

ligious brotherhood in which he sought
to realize a hish Ideal of friendship. Hii

Mr. YVIshart has succeeded admirably
in overcoming the difficulties set before
him. no impartial reader of his bonk will
deny. He very modestly says in his pre
face: "Whatever other shortcomings may
be found herein, there is an absence of
that unreasonable suspicion, not to say
hatred, of everything monastic, which
mars many other valuable contributions
to monastic history."

ered more in the light of a picture of

hero, a wealthy man by the name of John

drawn character in the book. He is aa

type of .many an old Callfornian now gone.
Colonel Reed presumes on his social ac
quaintance with John Gault to borrow
from him In small amounts a total Bum
of $510, and it is this little financial trans
action that causes all the trouble.
John works himself up Inio a state of
mental frenzy over the possibility of Viola"
being cognizant of the doings of her

very unnecessary and certainly cheapens
the hero for the reader. Several times

GERALDTNE CONNER'S "Hard-

with the fact in mind cf Miss Bon
incr's prolonged residence In Cali
fornia, her exceptionally Rood newspaper
â¢nork and the number of excellent short
stories she has written, we expected too
much from this, her first book. It pur
port*; to be a stcry of Fan Francisco of
to-day, and while RrojrraphieaHy and
climatically cr.rrect It fails utterly in tlin
attempt lo present our social life as it is.
Worse than thteâ the. pon pictures draw:i
by M!?s Bonner will probably be accepted
in many localities as jrosr-cl iruth *md
while they will not do r;s the harm that
Mrs. Gertrude Atherton did in tellir.K how
young: Fan l^anclsoo women climbed in
and cut of tiiclr windows at all hours to
attend fire c'.arnis <~r walk up and down
the street because they could -not sleep,
it will simpiy be because her book Is not
so ciarirgâ not because it is' more truth
.ful.
It Is very unfortunate that San Fran
c!pco should have to be Judged by so
called types set down as standards by
writers of fiction rvho havo resided- here
lor.g Â«ncugh to throw in sufficient color-
Ing of locality to apparently stamp their
<Tl-ions ns genuine. And yet that we are
Judped by these standards Is a fact be
yond question, rp. witness the acceptance
by our English cousins of Mrs. Atherton's
fanciful and uncomplimentary writings on
California customs, men and women.
So in the present work of Miss Bonner.
a. strang-er reading: her romance would at
or.ee decide that the author, having had
a long residence in our city, was In an
excellent position to speak authoritatively.
He would probably accept literally the
ppeeches and manners of her characters
as peculiarly Han Franciscanâ and judge
up accordingly.
San Francisco can offer for its size as
much of polish, culture, refinement and
education as any other city of the United
States. And for any one to regard seri
ously the parts of. Miss Bonner's book
which are supposed to deal with our soci.4
Mfe would be to form a decidedly wrong
opinion of ua. ,*,
That refined young men and women of
to-day occasionally Indulge in the cur
rent elansr expressions of the hour is a
fact that cannot be denied: but It Is a
fault that applies to every city of the
Union as well as to San Francisco. To
imagine, however, that their lang-uape is
r.ever free from such twistings of pure
English is to do them a great injustice.
If the world is Inclined to take Miss Bon

society is made up of persons whose polite

him, waa one of the hVid'saxneat.-inost
magnetic men I ever came In contact
with. I never knew him very well, as ha
was a man of great reputation, while. I.
â¢ at the time, was a mera tyro. He died :
the season before I joined Mrs. Drew's
company. It was a great pity, for he waa
only 82 years of age. a great actor, and
had a remarkable future before him.
Mrs. Drew was an actress who knew
her business more thoroughly than any
woman I ever met, except Laura Keene.
She commanded universal respect,
though her rather sarcastic vein of hu
mor did not make her many friends. An
example of her idea of humor, and
one that lingered In my mind, especially ,
as It was our last appearance on tha
eta&e together, occurrred when John
Wilkes Booth came to the Arch-street
Theater to appear as a star. He had risen
very suJdenlv, his previous appearance
in Philadelphia having been in a very un
important role, and lira. Drew did not
take very kindly to the idea of hi* com-'
ing to her theater and appearing In a
leading role. Like all of us Booth had
the greatest respect and fear for Mrs.
Drew, and she would rattle htm by pre
tending to look to him for advice and
suggestions as to what to do during re-;
hearsals.
"Where do you want me to stand. Mr,
Booth?" she would say, very sweetly.*
"Why-er, where-er-ever you have been,
accustomed to, Mrs. DTew," he would
say. somewhat abashed.
"Mr. Foirest used to want me to stand
here, but not all great actors agree, Mr.
Booth," very sweetly,
"Wellj you mightââ *
"Aâ a. and If yon "
"Yes, yes. yes, yes "
At this point Mr. Booth became- entirely'
rattled by her sweet yeses, began to stut
ter, got excited and broke down com
pletely.
Laura Keene. with whom I appeared la
ISS2-&5, was one of the mo3t intelligent
women I ever met, and yet*her most pro
nounced characteristic waa one which is
generally associated with ignorance* She.
was euperstitious to an absurd degree.
8he never allowed her actors to take hold
of a chair with the right hand. To study
a part on Sunday was a crime. To carry
an umbrella with a hook handle meant
Immediate discharge to the offender. Tha
sight of a bottle of red Ink was enough to ,
frighten her for a week. She said the us*>
of it was almost certain to precede soma
awful trouble.' On one occasion we were
playing a farce called "The Lady and tha
Devil." An Important scene was whera.
. she was seated at a writing table prepar- '
. atory to writing a letter. I. as her ser- 1
van t, was standing at the back of her
chair. '.Take your right hand away from
the chair," she said. In a stage whisper.
This rattled mÂ« a trifle. Ths stago dia
logue proceeded.
"You are sure you can find Don Rafael
at his lodgings?" â¢Â¦ .
"Yes, madam; his servant tells mi his
wound will confine him to his bed for a
week." â¢
"Is this the only paper we have? Wfcera
Is the ink?"
"Here, madam," and I bent forward to
place the ink urn within her reach, when
in confusion at her reproof the vessel was
upset and the contents trickled Into the
lap of her white satin dress. The Ink was
blood-red. The ghastly look that came
over the lady's face I shall never forget,
and I was so frightened that I never knew
how the scene ended. The next mornlnsr
at rehearsal she told me I would never
have any luck as long as I lived, and that
my trouble In the world beyond would ba
endless. She called the company together.
gave them a detailed account of the
"awful scene of the night before, occa
sioned by the stupidity o'f the young man
who would never make an actor." She*
told of a terrible dream she had had. In
which some great personage â to her un
knownâhad been foully murdered before
her eyes; how she had attempted his res
cue, but without avail; how he had fallen
dead at her feet, hl3 head resting on her'
lap while his life's blood slowly oozed
away.
" Two years after this occurrence to a
day Miss Keene waa playing at Ford's
Theater. ."Washington. In the third act of
the play a sharp shot was heard In tha
stage box, from which a man leaped
brandishing a smoking weapon and shout-
Ing "Sic semper tyrannis!" The audierce

Keene 'was the only person who seamed
to realize the situation. .. She ran to the
box, and in a moment the head of a dying

The greater part of lde Neff's adven

that one may spend half of his life trav

little ferry trip lest something befall
them. ~-'~-s : :
Though Mr. Neff has traveled continu
ously and realized what has been merely
a dream with thousands â the dream we
hope to realize when our ship comes Inâ
he haÂ» done it all without money. He
says that when you want to travel, the
way to do It Is to begin and travel â just
start out. If you haven't any money do
not let that stop you. Nothing but a po
liceman can do that if you really have a
mind to go, and no officer of the law has
â¢ever yet laid a hand upon Mr. Jseff, foi
he Is a good man, and tho constabulary

.Most of us are self-manacled to a life
which we detest. ' There is no reason why
we should not travel,. except that we do
not .want to. We hamper ourselves by
saying that we have our business affairs
to attend to. Mr. Xeff makes traveling
his business; and he goes right on and
attends to it. We would wait until we
pack our trunks, or perhaps we have not
one to pack and would have to wait until
we got It. "Sett . has no trunk, does not

All he has Is himself, and when he wants
to travel he just puts one foot before the

If he" wants -to travel farther or faster
than his feet can take him. then he put3

he says can always be found anywhere
In this much- underrated country of ours
by a man who Is really. looking for it.
So when he travels on foot It is only by
choice and for the reason that he wants
to see more of the country and its peo
ple than are on view from platform and
deck.
He carries no baggage, this traveler
with S6.000 miles' experience, and In that
he is as was the great De Lesseps. It
is chmper to buy than to pay freight and
be incommoded by impediments. .

only thing* ;he carries with him. In his
mind is the record of the miles and the
events that. ;have happened as he trav

Filled with that lonely feeling, even in
â¢ the thickest crowds, he started on his
travels, always going nsfar as his money
would take him, pausing only to earn
more. Searching 'feminine faces every

take the place of that which he had lost

The travel In search. of a mate at fast

would bring him money enough to enable

So he continued to feel, until one day
when he was picking oranges on the Pine

In the doorway his favorite brother DieK.
for whom he made ntfaiSHtway and bo^;in
a systematic search through his pf>ckM:\
at last finding his reward! with which he
went off like a pleased child.
This extraordinary boy, possessing no.
knowledge; of music, and in his limited
world hearing but little, will sit at the
piano and the strange weird outpouring's
of an -imprisoned soul fill -the air with an
unknown wild harmony as his fingers ca

forth Into enthusiastic npplau?c in which
the strange musician joined as he twisted

Eome music he arose clumsily and shuffled
along with uncertain step to the parlor.
There. â¢ seating himself at the piano, his
fingers strayed over the keys; cadences
followed, broken, wanOorirg, yet full of
beauty and pathos, and as I listened I
could not but think that seme* beautiful
caged soul struggled for breath under
that ungainly form and undeveloped
brain. Will It ever gain Its freedom?
Perhaps not in this life.
N'o attempt has ever been* made to give
this boy any scientific teaching. He is en
tlre'y ignorant of a note; has never had a
Irrsnn in his life and har. no power to com
prehend It were he given one. But. blessed
with a memory which Is developed to an
abnormal degree, he is enabled by the
mere repetition of nn;s!c hoard but once
to reproduce the xtrnfns of the organ af
ter service or the distant song of the
schoolboy as he pecs his way, with start
ling fidelity, without a note missing. |
Possessing an affectionate nature, he
ehows a dog-like devotion to the mem
bers of the family, and In return never
falls to receive a kind word and caress,
which are to him as essential as food, for
his keen, nervous sensitiveness will. cause
him to burst into tears at the slightest
unkind tone or look. There must be no
dtscord3 in his worltf; all is harmony.

and not unjustly, been regarded as an

Now. It happens that the spinal cord
which runs through the middle of the
backbone, within which. It is protected as
within a bony tube, io really a kind of
brain deputy In many respects. It acts
on the whole as the confidential servant
of the brain, but it also possesses an Inde

lower nature than those discharged by
the brain, but they are none the less es
sential for the perfect ordering of tho
body's welfare. Even If- the head offlco
be singularly well organized it cannot ex

the special cord is really a series of sub
offices which carry out many actions
which otherwise we might be tempted to
credit to the share of the brain.
We see a very dtstinct reflection of the
duality of our vital state In the very ar
rangement of our nervous system. The
chief masses of that system, as every one
knows, consist of the brain and the spinal
cord, and a second system of nerve masses
called the sympathetic system also exists
and is found lying as a double chain of
nerve knots or ganglia down the front of

there is nothing
to do but wait for the fight? I went
there to see Fltzsimmons defeat Corbett;
you couldn't pay me enough to make me
take that trip nRain. They were banking
on getting a lot of people and a lot of
money at that battle, but they didn't.
There were not 1000 men there from San
Francisco, and it's only twelve hours'
ride from there, as I recollect It, to Car-
Bon City. And every man Jack of them,
and all the others, too, made quick tracks
for the trains to get out of that place the
minute the fight was over.
But it's not bo in this city. Here a
man can come from far away; he can go
to the theater or to the opera; he can do
a thousand and. one things. to amUEC him
self or to Instruct himself, and he may
transact some business as well as see the
right. Bringing off these fights here
means throngs of people from Boston,
Philadelphia. .Cincinnati, Pittsburg, Cleve
land. Chicago and St. Louis, and even
from Kansas City. And they are all of
them looking for a good time and are
ready and willing to pay their "money to
get it. Doesn't that mean Something, fdr

like Madison Square Garden for having a

he Is a wonderfully clever lad and is well
liked. He's "on the level." too.
Now. suppose we can't have fights here,
what is to become of the game? No one
will go far to get to Chicago to see a
bout, because the lawmakers there will
allow them to battle for only six rounds.
Nor will they go to Philadelphia, where
the limit is the same. Surely the men
from this city who like a good battle will
not go into a car and ride for a day to
see two men buffet each other. The be^t
pecple here want to be able to get a good
dinner, then go leisurely to the Garden,
see the fight and be back In bed. or with
the family, by midnight, so they may be
up and at business the next morning, as
usual. But no more long trips to a town
where there Is nothing to be seen, where
there are no good hotels and where one
can't get a square meal.

I know that in that Corbett-McCoy af
fair there was a third individual In it be

ject was to make a bag of money In the
betting, but they were fooled at thRt. I
wan told to keep off it: not to bet my

can't see why the lawmakers want to

to see a fight.
Many think Corbet t ought to rank sec
ond because he made such a good showing
with Jeffries. But you must remember
that for a long time Jeffries.had hilped to
train Corbott; he was his punching bag,
and so it was that Corbett knew all of his
defects; And ho was wise enough not to
start right in lighting him. but to keep
away for a time. Jeffries, I believe, woulT.
whip him, much sooner now, as he. Is Im
proving all the time, while the other man
Is going back.
Writing of Corbett reminds me that he
and t fought for the biggest purse ever
battled for. It was $25,000, and there was
$10,000 up on each ride. There was no
division of the purseâ the winner was to
take till. I got a betiting; that's all I got
out of it. I sometimes wish I was fight
ing now, for with these clubs giving a per
centage of the receipts a first-class man
who Is always ready to fight could make
a barrel of money. But it's too lato to
think about that now; I've had my s.hare
of the glory and money, and my time has
gone.
In ending I want again to say to all men

that fact. I don't believe that after this

The first point to which attention may
be directed Is the collecting of evidence
regarding the immediate effect of severe

One of the best known Illustrations of the
fact that such injury does not produce
immediate death, or at least that absolute
cessation of all movements which we pop
ularly recognize as the main feature of
life's ending; is that afforded by the case
of Captain Nolan. The . captain headed
the famous charge of the Light Brigade at

state of death. Kvldenee Is accumulating
of the- most surprising nature to prove
that life frequently exists after supposed
death has occurred, much of which is both

boxing back Into the rot where It was

THE FUTURE OF PRIZE-FIGHTING
7The riddle was solved after years of ex
perimenting:. It was found -that fibrous
magnesia would stand high degrees of
heat without becoming too hot for the
contact of the body of any one who might
be resting upon it. On a sheet of fibrous
magnesia one can take heat up to 400 de
grees without being scorched.

them, looked around to learn the cause of
the commotion, and one of the naked
lights they carried cane In contact with

Since all great Inventions are the results
of small beginnings, the human bakeovens
have merely evoluted from the homely
mustard and flaxseed plasters or the heat
ed stovelid. Every one knows how ef

They are the good old household remedies
for the alleviation of pain.
They are good, but science wanted some
thing better, and tHte demand has at last
been supplied by these ovens, in which
human beings can be baked alive.
The greatest v difficulty encountered in
applying hot air at high temperature is to
avoid actually cooking the flesh of the pa

FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SLEEP.
THE old tradition that tha hours of
sleep before midnight are hours of
"beauty sleep" means only that late
hours take away' beauty. Thousand*
of night workers will testify that eight
hours of sleep from 10 to 6 is wprth ten
hours taken after retiring at 4 o'clock in
the morning. Darkness is the proper time
for the sleep that does the most good.
It Is not well, to sleep in a room in
which plants are growing. Their food Is
carbonic acid gas. If they can live there
the room is a bad place for you to sleep
In. Besides, plants use up a good deal
of oxygen and .give off effluvia and pollen
irritating to the human system.
The soundest sleep is during the first
three or four hours after going to bed.
This has been ascertained by scientific
experiment, though most people think
they sleep soundest Just before the time
when conscience tells them to get up.
Insomnia often comes from overeating.
A little dieting may do more good than a
lot of doctors' prescriptions. More per
sons suffer from overeating than from
overworking.
Long, deep breathing kept up &s long
as possible by will power Is the most
generally recommended remedy for occa
sional sleeplessness. The main aim In
such cases Is to keep the mind from
thinking. This Is sometimes accomplished
by the strain of keeping the eve fixed on
some point In the ceiling or keeping tha
will fixed on the effort not to move eveiÂ»
the smallest muscle. Monotony will put
any man to sleep in spite of himself.
Most psychologists acknowledge that
deep study of any subject Just before go
ing 1 to sleep may result in something Ilka
a revelation as to some phase of that sub
ject, the mmd through unconscious cere
bration accomplishing wonders without
the assistance of the will. Passages to be
memorized should be rry.-i ;e'". several
times before going to be".
Sometimes the sleeplessness of cMldren
is owlne to excitation of the digestlva
organs. In that case it is a r.."Â»S plan to
allow only vegetable foods at ina Â«veni2Sf
meal.

widespread belief that Charles Stew

Is he who Is now fighting against

that. Instead of dying, Parnell simply
withdrew from public life, intendlnr to
wait until a more favorable time arrived
for putting his cherished plans into exe

firmly fixed in the people's minds that the
great patriot's tomb is to-day neglected,
though It was for several years a Mecca
for patriotic Irishmen and the rendezvous
of all the Nationalist societies in Ireland.
And, If Irishmen sympathize with the

ftFked It I knew that I was losing my
head, and straightened up and began
again to shout.
neâ It rounded like c, rumbling, for I was
pretty nearly deafened from the shock.
ITS no fun to hang a thousand feet
above the earth when a dangling
balloon rope Is the only thing that
holds you.
Aeronauts claim that they like to float
in midair. I have my doubts of even
that, but dangling is very different from
fl. Â¦ at: t-.g- In a surely constructed basket or
a parachute. It's no fun. I say, to have
your kg tangled in a guy rope and to be
jerked all cf a sudden you don't know
Â¦Â» here.
It was llofT who was making the aseen-
Firn frnrn the l'ark in San Jose. He's a
ooÂ£ aeronaut, I ruess; he must be. to
have saved me under the circumstances.
My unexpected trip Fpoiled his, and we
Loth came down tencthcr.
Thoro was the biggest kind of a crowd
gathered to see the ascension. Hoft* was
expected to be the star performer, but 1
think I v.as the whole show to toms spec
tators within tea seconds after the balloon
started. I couldn't hold the stage until
the end. though, for Hoft was a brave
follow and rescued me at the risk of his
own life, and he gets the credit he de
serves.
The- balloon made its ascent at night,
and a great spectacle was promised,
roman candles were to be put off by Hoff
after he was well up In the air, and the
r.ovclty of this drew lots of people who
don't usually care much about balloon
ascensions. As many as two thousand
roople. I am told, were gathered about
the spot.
There were a lot of curious fellows who
came close to the big airship, and I was
rr.e at the crowd. If I hadn't had so
much curiosity I'd npver have taken my
sky ride. There's no use talking about
"lfs" now. though, is there? I had to go
and "rubber" with the rest of the lot,
and that's how I came to be picked up.
Hcff was going through a few flourishes
bjr way of preparation. I remember
watching him and thinking 1 he looked like
a pretty Eturdy sort of a chap, but he
didn't Interest me as much as his flying
machine did. The gas bag and the basket
end the rcpes and the parachute were
new to me and I looked at them all close
ly and was so much Interested In them
that I didn't pay much attention to any
body around me. My pockets could all
have been picked clean and I wouldn't
have known the difference. As It proved,
I could have been carried off myself and
not known the difference.
Somebody put up a practical Joke on me,
I believe, and you can't make me be
lieve anything different. I know my foot i
could never have been caught In those
ropes so firmly. I am cure now that I
felt the rope being tied around my leg
b.1 the time that I thought somebody was
fumbling and trying to get hold of the
rcpe to help cling to the balloon. I was
pretty well absorbed and I didn't pay an?
attention to the fact that my feet were
mixed up in come kind of a knot.
After Hoff's flourishes were over and he
wr-nt about his business there was a still
ness came over the crowd. Just as if
somebody had said "Hush." and put out
a hand over the whole lot of them, they .
all were quiet. Everybody was watching
him or trying to â craning necks and push-
Ing and stepping over each other and
fquecz'r.g in between and lifting babies
upon shoulders. Hoff looked them all
over and waved his hand and rose.
At Use Fame instant I stepped backward.
That is, I started to. The ship went up
with a tig Jerk, and to my surprise I
found mypf-lf going too.
It seems that I was caught in one of the
ratlines from the bag of the balloon,
about twenty fret above the trapeze on
wh'^h HofT was seated. I grasped the
ropei with both hands and managed to
draw myself uj<. With the rope entangled
about my 1Â«-ks and body I perched there,
1'jFtily calling to Hoff to save me. At
any', rate I cm told so. I can't remem
ber very well that I called at all. and
I haven't the faintest idea what I eaid.
I know 1 wanted help pretty badly,
though, for I saw plainly enough there
was nothing! could do to save myself.

v.-orld around, the seven seas over, there
Is never a maiden with her record.
Around the world twice, acrcps the

trJn's wives braved the sea journeys with
their husbands. Nowadays it !s rather
rare for Mis. "Captain to go alonfj. Bairns
as j-our.c as Gladys Graham seldom if
ever went.
Little Gladys has ppent juat threo
months of her life en shore. Evcn.vrhen
the Balling vessel is in port the famliy
live on beard, so Gladys has never had
much chr.nce to try her little sea legs on
oarth. Her life is utterly unlike that of
children cf her age.
She saw the circus the other day, but
she's never known any of the lesser de
lights of childhood.. She can't play hop
scotch or prisoners' base. She's never
known the dizzy bliss of a swing or the
rapture of rolling down a grassy hill.
Even mud pics are unknown pleasures.

Dear Callâ I thought I'd like to write a
letter to the Httlo girls who live on shore.
Perhaps they'd -^Ike to know . something
about a little girl who lives on the big

as Uncle Sam to send it by, and my papa
knows everything, 'cause he's a captain.
This is the way I write all my letters
just say them, and somebody else writes.
It's much nicer end you don't have to fuss
about spelling and things.
I was awful glad to be in San Francisco
during the celebration, 'cause I'm a native
daughter myself. I was born In Sausallto
and I'm 6Vfe years old, and I always get
birthday presents. I haven't been here so
very much, though, 'cause I've been so
busy traveling about. You see, I've been'
around the Horn nine times, across the
equator thirty times and all around the .
world twice.
It ain't very good not to have natural
curly hair, on board ship. It gets all
s-plaphed and blowed out by the wind. I
won't let mamma put mine up in papers
'eept when we're in port. I don't have any
little boys to play with on board ship. I
like them better .than girls, 5 but I can't
even have girls. Sometimes I play with
my dolls. I pretend that they are sailors
and soldiers, 'cause they know how to
mind. : Â¦
I'm not a sailor any more. When I was
six my papa said, "Gladys, we'll have to
make a boatswain of you now.": He 'say's
perhaps I'll be a third mate in a year or
so, if I learn how to obey orders better.
But I don't like to mind very much, so I
guess I'll have to be the captain v

oh, my! you ought to see- the ! way the

arid I'd rather bQ one of the little girls
in a safe little bed on land when they
come. Big storms ain't nice, either, but
1 don't get so very afraid. I hold mam
ma's hand tight, because I think it makes
her feel. more comfy. . . ; â¢ '" Â¦;
I like some of the sailors and there's
one who can tell fine stories. 'He's a
Frenchman, though, find his tongue gets
all twisted and then he talks with his
bands. But he tells the loveliest stories.
Borne of the Â¦ sailors are awful ugly and
I don't like those.
Sometimes I wonder about all the chil
dren on land and how they'd like to bo
a child of the sea, "cause that's what
papa says I: am. My papa has lots of
swords and sabers and weapons from dif
ferent lands and I get down those that
are' not too heavy and put them on.
Sometimes I play that I'm leading a mu
tiny and let one of the dolls be captain,
but most always I'm captain myself and
kill all- the dolls with my sword. I don't
really kill them though. '
I've seen lots of things that you chil
dren* never see. Whales and queer things
that live in the water. Only I'm not
afraid 5 of Â¦ them, "cause I'm a captain's

going to marry a captain. That's all I

SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST REMARKABLE SAILOR GIRL"That's why I don't like football
games," she says; "because I can't play,
too."
It was at Delhi that she attended the
famous hunt given by Sir Bindon Blood.
It was famous principally because she at
tended it. Some of the women stayed be
hind and the others went as spectators
all except Miss Leiter. She went to ba
one of the hunting party, for she is never
a spectator at any kind of excitement
where she can be part cf it.
And in the face of every protest she
went and worked and brought help where
help was needed.
"I am going, too," she replied.
Horses and merrymaking are not the
only phases of life that have held her at
tention in India. There has been famine
there ar.d people have suffered and died.
Lord and Eedy Curzon mads a tour of
the plague-stricken districts.
"You must have a good time while wa
are gone. Daisy." they said.
There was only one incident to mar tha
ride, and that was really no matter at all.
Daisy Said. As they came to a puddle of
muddy -water the elephant dipped la a
passing trunk, and its rider, not knowing
Us fancy for shower baths, wa3 not wlso
enough to prevent It. Splash, and a
trunkful of water doused the elephant's
face and Miss Letter's organdie into tha
bargain. Lady Curzon laughed and Mrs.
Lelter said "I told you so" when the fam
ily raet asraln.
How she managed to ride that elephant
nobody could ever guess. It Is supposed
that the Indian language is the only ona
to which an elephant responds, and what
Miss Leiter said to it she has never told.
JJut she handled the hanger like a native,
apd It accepted her prods in complete sub
mission. She drove it faster, and tha
mahout trotted hard to keep up and did
not then succeed. f
Daisy approached the elephant. She
etroked its trunk by way of first advance.
It regarded her calmly.
"I am ready to mqunt." she said.
The driver gave a command In his own
language. The elephant began to kneel.
"That isn't the way you mount," sha
! interrupted.
The servant stared. What could she,

she explained. And she was. Several
ideas In 3uddh!st head3 were blasted la
that mement. :.. â¢ 'â¢
- Seated on the neck of her steed she- set
out with a dazed mahout trotting meekly
beside her and giving advice to the ele

the strenuous social functions that her
entrance into Indian life demanded wheu
in swept Daisy.
". â¢Â¦'/Give parties, Mary, parties," she de
manded. "More. more. This^ climate Is
the most Intoxicating. thing, I ever drank.
Let's dance, dance, dance."
"Whom 'do you want invited?"
"Everybody. The siout old officers,
plenty of them, to lend solemnity, Â»r
rather to lose, solemnity. And the gor
geous young .officers and those stunning
nativesâ have plenty of natives, Mary. I
like their eyes. They are like the eyes
of a red setter."
Miss Daisy, as well as her sister and
brother-in-law, showed a fancy for the
natives. What may have been policy or
kindness on their part was genuine liking
on hers. She admired their costumes,
their manners, themselves. They admired
her in return.
The balls were gorgeous affairs.. At
them Miss Leiter held center stage while
all the English girls who had been pluia-
Ing themselves upon their calcium effects

a circle about one smalt American who,

serious, gracious, lovable. When Daisy
arrived, India found her crisp, sparkling,
and lovable, too. â¢
The first thing she did was to greet her
relatives; the next was to greet a red
and gold gowned servant and Inquire of
him where those, gowns were to be had.
She wanted one. she said. Where did he
get It? Keady made in Calcutta? He
gazed a large brown gaze at her.
The days ar.d the weeks that followed
made Simla, Calcutta and Burrackpore

had marched on before in their own state
ly way, But now there was a small hur
ricane in their midstâ a hurricane that
had swept over the seas all the way from
America and was sweeping up dignified
British officers and whirling them whither
it listed. Some were young and pride
puffed, .some were old "and pompous; all
of them were whirled, however, just as
giddily as If they had never known wha:
it was to be majestic.
Miss Daisy Letter had sw^pt social In
dia off its feet. There was no use re
sisting, for she wouldn't be resisted. She,

that everybody else should do likewise. â¢

him a millionaire. He took his money
and his family and settled with them in
Washington. ' . '
There the ' attack upon society was
made. People looked on and said it
couldn't be done. They did not count
upon Mary Lelter's vast reserve force.
I By her beauty, her brain, her complete
charm, she won her way into Washing
ton society. She left this way paved for,
the little sister, who was to follow her
soon on the road to young ladyhood.
Daisy, had already made herself known
to Washington when she left. She had
already caused Mr. Lelter some mental
disturbance.
He Is a comfortable man and he hates
to have his peace upset by these uaugh
ters.' No sooner had Mary been taken
"off his hands than Daisy began to make
him trouble. Mary liad perturbed him
very much by marrying an Englishman.
He docs hope that Daisy will settle down
at home.
.So when the young lady went a-visltlng
in India and half a dozen engagement
rumors concerning her and half a dozen
British officers were wafted back .by
gossipy sea's, Mr. Leiter groaned half
a dozen times. It ?/us the same old
stor.vâ oh, tbeae girls, tbts^ ciil&l
Â¦what happened, eossip had to draw upon
its own powers of .'nvention. At any
rate, Major Colin Campbell of the Central
India Horse Guards â¢' was Savored
later on and appeared to be a complete
usurper of Lord Suffolk's place as the
months wore away. And now she la
home again and Mr. Levl Lelter is kept
busy denying that there is any engage
ment at all and the men that
have sighed for her for more than a year
are brushing up their hopes again and
getting them ready to wear. 'However â
nobody knows.
Perhaps, after all, Daisy Lelter cares so
much for her horses that she can't find
quite enough room in her heart for a
man.
Certain it is that she is one of the
most wonderful horsewomen that ever
dazzled India and she says that the
reason she can do anything with horses
is that she loves them. She understands
them and they understand her.
So when she took up residence in an
elephant country she tried the same
tactics. It was not enough to know that
the mahout was along to look after the
animal. Miss Lelter would look after
him herself.
The howdah was ready for a small party
ca U;e. Gav wfcen. aba fcscams. an elephant
She sat still for a moment, because sna
couldn't think quite what to do, and when
she woke up she saw the man and the
boar on the ground together, and she
knew that the man was helpless and that
the beast was standing back just far
enough. to charge with terrific force. She,
could not call; she could only grasp her
spear and charge herself. The animal's
eyeÂ« were fixed upon its victim who lay
upon the ground. It had no thought ex
cept for the attack it was about to make.
Then swiftly.* from somewhere e!se de
scended a surely aimed spear that struck
between the eyes and made it spring back
angrily. Before it could recover to charge
again the man's spear was active once
more, and Sir Blndon's hunt was con
cluded with a dead boar, a saved man
and a heroine.
She la an American ftiV
And after much resistance she had her
way. A' private elephant was ordered for

SEARCHING FOR THE LOST TREASURES OF A GOD
TO Tunis belongs the honor of be-
Ir.g the headquarters of the most
ji extraordinary stock company In
the wcrld, the object ' of which
is to unearth the treasures of a
mythical or eemi-mythlcal Carthaginian
deity, which, according to tradition, have
for &ges been burled beneath the waters
at a little distance from Tunis. This
Pun'.c deity was Eshmoun, who was
known to the Romans under the name of
Saturn. His treasure. It Is said, consists
of gold coins, gold bai-s. Jeweled vessels
and exquisite statues, and it is valued at
no less than 400,000,000 francs. There are
zcany popular legends about It. and the
people of Syria are convinced that they
are based on truth.
People talked about this wonderful
treasure as far back as Emperor Nero's
time. Suetonius, in his life of Nero, and
Tacitus, in the sixteenth book of his an
nals, says that Nero sent a fleet to Carth
tge in the hope of recovering this treas
ure, about which he had heard surprising
stories from a Carthaginian knight named
Casellius Cajssius. The fleet, however.
searched In vain, and as a result Caselllus
committed eulclde. At a later period a
new legend arose, according to which the
Carthaginians, shortly before the destruc
tion of their city, carried off their costliest
treasures and buried them in a subter
ranean necropolis beside those of the god.
This necropolis Is said to be under the hill
known as Sldl-bu-Hassan, and to be con
nected with Carthage by means of a tun
nel. It IÂ« a fact that when the harbor of
Tunis was being constructed the engi
neers found traces of a tunnel, which led
toward this hilL
Forty years ago a native of Morocco at
tracted wide attention In Tunis owing to
the fact that from a copdltlon of extreme
poverty he suddenly attained a position
of great wealth. Daily he -squandered
large sums of money and there seemed no
limit to his riches. He explained that he
had suddenly discovered hÂ«ap3 of gold in
the bowels of the earth, and he .attributed
his good fortune to an ancient manu
script, which, he claimed, had pointed out
to him a secret way leading to the cham
ber in which have been stored for cen
turies the treasures of the Carthaginians
and of their god Eshmoun. A friend, he
said, had helped him in the search Tor
gold.
Soon afterward he and this friend left
Tunis, and fifteen years later the former
returned and made an attempt to acquire
a fresh supply of gold. Finding that he
could not succeed without help he entered
Into partnerhlp with a man named Em
barek, as well as with several others, and
the result was that he managed to get as
far as the door of the subterranean.tem
ple in which the treasures were concealed.
At this point, however, a quarrel arose as
to which should be the first to enter the
sacred precincts, and finally a v furious
fight endued, which ended in the death of
the native of Morocco and one of his
companions. The others, terrified at the
tragedy, left the place hastily, and having
bound each other to secrecy fled from the
city. . â¢ ;
All this sounds rather,, mythical and,
nebulous, but now we come to solid facts.
Two years ago Embarek. who had fled to
Morocco, returned to Tunis and looked
for those who had accompanied him on
the previous expedition, his Intention be
ing to endeavor once more to obtain ac
cess to the rubterranean temple. He
found two of his former companions, and
one night he and they went to look for
the entrance tc the tunnel which leads
toward the" temple. As various excava
tions, however., and other changes had
been made in that part of the city within
the -last few years, -they were unable to
find It. and 1 after much consultation they
decided to apply for advice to Senor Me
dina; an archaeologist who has' accjuired
a wide reputation through his work .'on
the ruins of ancient Carthage. -
He. was amazed when he heard their"
story, and he advised them to take Into
their confidence Baron Anselme de Kin
saye, a member of the French Academy
and ' an enthusiastic archaeologist, who
was then in Tunis. Embarek told the
Baron the marvelous Btory of the subter
ranean temple and of the countless treas-^
ures hidden In It3 chambers, and his tale
was apparently so circumstantial and so

The Government thereby granted him
undents associates permission to make at

colleagues agreed to : hand over to the
Government one-half of the treasures

possible misunderstanding 1 , a 'committee
was appointed to decide as to the value of
any such recovered treasures.
The excavations, were then begun, but
did not prove as successful as was sus

ADVENTURES OF AN AMERICAN
GIRL IN INDIATMJK &ZFNT>A7Z CAlLIi. â¢
12GOLDEN INGOTS OUT WEIGH SILVER BRICKS.
GHIC-VGO,,Oct. 20.â To the Editor. of The Call: I firmly believe Bryan
will be elected. I think a .ar$e majority of the American people are
opposed to the re-election of McKlnley. I think the public conscience
has been aroused during: the present.' campaign to a - greater ' degree)
-than ever before. It Is my opinion that not " since - 1S6O- have the pec^
ple been so Impressed with the gravity of the situation." When such Repub
licans, patriarchs and partisans as George S.Boutwell of Massachusetts, Sen-,
ator Wellington of Maryland, former Senator 'Henderson of* Missouri.' Gen
eral Beatty of Ohio ai\d hundreds of -others that could be ' named "abandon
their party under the profound conviction i that the re-election of ' McKlnley
would endanger the republic it is safe to say' that the same thought and fear
have found lodgment ln'the minds of- the people at large."
The anti-imperialist movement, in my judgment, is proper and more pro
found at this time than was the mugwump movement that defeated Blalna
in 1S84, or the gold Democrat movement that contributed so materially to the
election of McKinley In 1S96. In ISSi'and 1SS6 only objection to candidates or
purely domestic issues capable of being- remedied at any time Influenced the
electorate. ' - Â¦Â¦' ......
Now the very foundation of the Government is in dangerâ the . scepter is
in sightâ and the uniformed \ soldier, at every street corner on every highway.
- with conscription acts and forced drafts as accompaniments, are things of the
future that must be crushed' or encouraged- at the ensuing. election. Ninety
per cent of the gold Democrats' will follow the example of Olney'and Blssell
and vote for Bryan. _ â¢Â» â¢ -
The super-friendly relationsâ I will not say allianceâ between the Tory
Government of Great Britain and the administration of McKlnley which' led
to our Government notoriously sympathizing with Great Britain's cold-blooded
destruction of the two South Â¦ African republics ' has * supremely disgusted
Â¦many persons and added to the evidences of the imperialistic tendencies ot
; McKlnley and his advisers. ,
--. . But while , the preservation of the constitution and the principles of. the
'Declaration of Independence form the paramount issue of the campaign pure
ly domestic questions are not lust sight of. The American people as a whole
are satisfied that the great trusts have control of the Republican, party, and
that the only hope of regulating or controlling these monster corporate ag
gregations is by returning the Democrats topower. The negroes, who have
Mong held the, balance of power in such States as Illinois. Indiana and Ohio,
arÂ«? breaking away from the Republican party. The colored men fear impe
Â¦ rialism and can" see no hope for their future in a Government by trusts. The
colored men of Illinois, Ohio and Indiana have made Republican Presidents.
â¢but Northern colored men are never rewarded with office when the Repub
licans are in power in Washington. The offices are given to Southern ne
groes in payment for work in conventions,; while the colored men in the
doubtful or Republican States are ignored.
These are some of the reasons why*. I feel ; satisfied with the present out
look and why I believe that Bryan will be elected.
JAMES K. JONES. Chairman Democratic National Committee
JONES SAYS HE BELIEVES BRYAN WILL
BE ELECTED.
Â£IIICAGO, Oct. M.â To the. Editor of The Call: Xo one who has care
fully observed the trend of events during the last three weeks can
have failed to notice that popular sentiment has been running strongly
in favor. of the election of the Republican candidates.. This is t due,
not .'only to the Inherent justice and right of the cause which the Re
publican party stands for and the vigorous. campaign which has been car
ried on by Republicans everywhere, but has been much accelerated by the
very foolish utterances of Mr. Bryan on the stump. -In the glass belt In In
diana, which has been commercially developed almost entirely by. the tinplate
and glr.ss industries, which have givrn employment to thousands of working
men and all built up by reason of the tariff on these articles, Mr. Bryan
stated in his epeech that the way to reach the - eo-called glass and tinplate
trus-ts was to remove the tariff from these articles. It can readily be Been
that this Ftatement was fatal to him and his party in that section of the
State cf Indiana and ever since that speech Indiana has been no longer doubt
ful.
Shortly after he followed with a ppeech at Salem, III., which was un-
Trorthy of him or any candidate for President. In this speech he, in the bold
est way, endeavored to stir up discontent and hostility on the part of those
â¢who were not as fortunate as others against those who had accumulated a
competence. I think this speech alarmed many of his more conservative sup
porter?, as I have been advised of many who had before that been inclined
to support him announcing their determination to vote the Republican
ticket. All through the West thousands of farmers of every nationality
who voted for Bryan four years ago, will now vote for McKinley, and a
#ontinuation of the present business conditions, and in the former so-called
Eilver States the people are deserting Bryan almost en masse, and I believe
that a majority of the States west of the Mississippi River that voted for.
Bryan four years ago will now cast their electoral vote for McKinley. ; Not
one of the Slates between the Mississippi River and the Alleghany Mountains
north of Tennessee which voted for McKinley btfore but will do so again at
the coming election. The antl-imperialipt campaign of the Democrats has
fallen fiat. Its supporters have found that the people regard them In the
position they have taken as unpatriotic and unwise, and the Democratic poli
ticians have found it unpopular. In the West they have abandoned it as an
iFFue and are turning their attention to the anti-trust plank in their plat
form. As their campaign has been based upon anti-everything, * I look in
another week for them to change to anti-something else.
The poll of Kentucky shows that McKinley will carry that State by more
than 30,000 majority, and the only question Is, Can the Democrats, under
the provisions of the Infamous Goebel law, steal it?
I am Epcaking only of the States that come within the Jurisdiction of the
headquarters of Chicago. As to those, east of the Alleghany Mountains I
am not in close touch and do not care to express . an , opinion without proper
knowledge, although I have no doubt that every State that voted for McKin
ley In that section of the country* four years ago will. do. so again.
H. C. PAYNE. Vice Chairman Republican. National Commltte*.
PAYNE TELLS WHY BIG REPUBLICAN
VICTORY IS CERTAIN.
MeKinley and Roosevelt will hold all
the border Southern States that went for
McKinley and Hobarc in 1*05. with the
exception of Kentucky. Kentucky is
doubtful still, but the probabilities are in
favcr of Its going for Bryan. West Vjr
gir.ia, Maryland and Delaware are re
tarded as safe for the Republican candi
dates. lIcKinlc-y will probably have In
ciana, and if he gets it the result will
t>e due entirely to the farmer vote. The
States which were carried by Bryan in
1SSS, and which will po for McKinley this
year, are South Dakota, Kansas, Wash
ington and Wyoming. Bryan got one
electoral vote in California in 1S96. Cali
fornia is solid for McKinley now. Wth
the exception of Kentucky. McKinley will
hold all the States of the Union that he
carried in 1S>5 and make a net fain of
eleven, electoral votes in California, South
California Solid for McKinley.
In both investigations practically the
fame result has been reached in all the
States which during the campaign have
been regarded as fighting territory.
In addition to this the country has been
canvassed in another way, through other
correspondents or through newspapers

Governor, and of the success of the Dem
ocratic electors. -
Republican success In Kansas for the
electoral ticket seems to be assured.
Bryan had a plurality in lb% of 12,330.
The indications this year are that Mc-
Kinley will have it by- 12,000.
* North Dakota and South Dakota, which
may be classed as doubtful States, will
both go for McKinley. though if there Is
any change in this it will be in South
Dakota. Bryan carried South Dakota in
1896 by the exceedingly narrow margin of
183. Bryan will probably be able to hold
his own State. Although the Republicans
have made considerable gains in Ne
braska, State pride is likely to give the
eight electoral votes to Mr. Bryan. His
majority !s estimated at 50G0 against 13,576
in 1S96. If he should lose the election, as
is probable, the fusionlsts are likely to
capture the Legislature --and' give Mr.
Bryan one of the seats in the United
States Senate. - -
In the Mountain States.
The -\ mountain States; through whfch
Governor Roosevelt swept in the, early
days of the campaign on a special train
with, varying success^ furnish very inter
esting situations. .
Montana, Idaho, Wyoming. Colorado
and Utah â¢ were all carried by Bryan in
1$9C This year .Wyoming will go to Mc-
Kinley by a majority of not less than 5000.
The Silver Republicans concede defeat
and the Democrats have abandoned hope.
Idaho Is claimed by both parties, because
of a complete fusion of all tho anti-Re
publican elements, which is likely to go
for Bryan.
Montana will be carried by. Bryan,
though the result of the Senatorial con
test is in doubt.
Colorado ,1s conceded to Bryan by the
national Republican leaders, although the
State Committee claims the State.
.The Mormons can sway Iftah to Mc-
Kinley or Bryan, as they choose. The In
dications seem to be that the State will
go for Bryan.
The Pacific Coast Is solidly for McKin
ley. Here Bryan in 1S36 got five electoral
votes. He will get none in 1900.
California will give McKinley a large
majority. There is no doubt whatever of
the result in Oregon. v i-V -
Washington, .which has been carried by
the Republicans since 1S96. Is almost cer
tain to go for McKinley on the expansion
issue 1 .
Changes In the popular vote from 1896
are indicated in various States. It is not
likely that in any Eastern State will tha
plurality for McKinley be as large as in
1S36.
The plurality of 268,000 in New York will
be more than cut in two. A similar slump
in the high tide of four years ago is Indi
cated In New Jersey. McKinley will hold
his own In Ohio, and may have a smaller
plurality than 47.000, which he had in 1S96.
There is not likely to be any such plu
rality a3 142,000 In Illinois. In Iowa tha
65,000 Republican plurality of 1SD6 is likely
to be swelled to 80,000. In Wisconsin tho
plurality of 102,000 in 1S06 may fall to 65,
ooo. :^v:;;
In* Missouri the Democrats are likely to
suffer a big loss in the vote for their elec
toral ticket. They had 6S.727 In 1S96. This
year it may be reduced as low as 5000.
' Returns from many States, as already
detailed, show that McKinley will run
ahead of the State and legislative tickets.
This is not due to the fact that McKinley
is stronger than his party, but that Bryan
la weaker than his party. McKinley will
lead the State tickets in New York. Illi
nois, Kansas, Minnesota, Connecticut and
Wisconsin.
Information comes from Washington,
D. C. to the effect that If McKinley wins
he will deem it a vindication and an over
whelming vote of confidence. Under tha
circumstances it will be far short of that.
It will be rather a repudiation of the man
who is running against him. s Not In a
Presidential campaign In a generation, has
there been such a general exhibition of
voters selecting the lesser of two evils.
The Call's returns reveal that while
voters are not satisfied with the policy of
the Government in Por^j Rico and the
Philippines and while. there is a great dis
like and distrust of the Industrial tenden
cies toward trusts and combinations of
capital, the powerful thought In control of
the voting will be a fear of Mr. Bryan on
financial questions and the belief that hÂ«
would bring commercial, financial and In
dustrial disaster if he went into the Whits

Republicans Will Carry the Golden
State With Ease.
AH the Indications' point to President
McKinley carrying California by a largo
Pluralities in New York.
The Call's poll indicates that McKinley
will have a plurality in the State of 115,
000. Both parties are claiming the State,
the Republicans : with a much greater
show of confidence. Private information
from the Democratic committee is that
the men at the head of the machine ex
pect Bryan to lose by 75,000 In the State.
He cannot- make the result close unless
he docs much better in Greater New
In the case of an unexpected landslide
to Bryan, the House would be surely
Democratic and the Senate would be
doubtful.
In the present House the Republicans
have 1S5, the Democrats 1C2, all other anti-
Republicans 7, while there are three
vacancies. This gives the Republicans a
working majority of six. The informa
tion furnished by correspondents is that
the new House will have certainly 1S5 Re
publican votes, the Democrats will have
153, there will be 3 fusionlsts and Silver
Republicans, 2 Populists, and fourteeen
districts are doubtful.
Gains in the- House have been made by
the Democrats in the West and South, but
they are offset by gains made by Re
publicans in the East.
In the Senate, where the Republicans
have fifty members, the indications are
that next year the.y will have at least
forty-six members; which Is onÂ« more
than a majority. There are eleveirdoubt
ful Senatorial elections pending and the
Republicans can scarcely lose the control
of the Senate, even should Mr. Bryan be
elected. Quay may not be elected in
Pennsylvania, Elkins may be defeated in
West Virginia and Pettigrew may lose In
South Dakota.
To return to the Presidential contest.
Xew York, as the natural strategic point
of the campaign, has become the great
battle-ground. Mr. Brvan and his sup
porters realize that if they do not carry
New York State they will have no chance
whatever of getting the election. There
fore the eyes of the country are on the
Empire State.
Composition of Congress.
Dakota, Wyoming and Washington.
. In the poll made for the purpose of as
certaining the complexion of the Fifty
seventh Congress, careful estimates were
made in each doubtful district in the
country. The result shows that unless
there Is a very close contest over the
Presidency, both houses of Congress will
be controlled by the Republicans.

there will be. two vacancies, is so fierce

York than the polls and canvasses now

of setting- 80.000 plurality in Greater
New York, as Croker shows, his plurality
will be nearer 26.000. His plurality In
Manhattan and the Bronx (New York
County) is placed at 30,000, which some
Democrats think too high. Brooklyn
(Kings County) should be carried by Mc-
Kinley by at least GO00. Queensborough
(Queens County) will probably go for"Mc-
Klnley by 700 and Bryan will carry Rich
mond Borough by 1200. McKinley's total
plurality in that portion of the State out
side of Greater Xew York should be 141,
0G0 and McKinley's plurality in the State
is thus figured at 115,660,
It is likely that Benjamin B. Ode.ll Jr.,
Republican candidate for Governor, will
defeat John Stanchfield, Democrat, by ,91,
000 plurality. . Mr. Odell's plurality may
fall below that figure.
The Republicans stand to grain five
members of the New York State Senate
and the party divisions in that body will
be thirty-two Republicans to eighteen
Democrats. In the Assembly there will be
ninety-four Republicans tnd fifty-six
Democrats.

cratic losses in both the Fifth and Sixth
districts are due to three causes.
â¢ Many voters in the western half of the
State have been compelled to move on ac
count of drought. Perhaps a. majority of
these voters have gone to the eastern
counties In the State. This loss will not
affect Bryan, but it will reduce the ma

this fall. In the elections of 1535 and again
In 1S39 the fuslonists cast a larger per cent
of the total vote in Nebraska than the
Democrats did in Missouri or the Repub
licans in Ohio. To defeat Mr. Bryan In
his own State the Republicans must make
surprising gains. Outside Republican
headquarters in the city of Omaha, there
i3 not a Republican politician who ex
presses any confidence in McKihley's abil

Republican confidence in the election of

United States Senators are to be elected
for full terms in Nebraska next winter,
and the Congressional, legislative and ju

There are at least ten counties where the
legislative majorities seldom reach nfty
votes, and these counties will determine
whether two Republicans or one Populist

"With few exceptions the Gold Demo
crats of Buffalo who supported McKinley
four years ago are still favorable to him,
while the Democratic organization itself

This Is largely due to the bitter Demo

fought out in the county.
The fact that the present regime has
been defeated at the primaries and will be
forced to abdicate after the election is not
conducive to effective work. Of the mem

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEM
OCRATIC NATIONAL COM
MITTEE.
Benjamin B. Odell Jr., the Republican
candidate for Governor, according to
these estimates, will run about 23.S30 votes
behind McKinley. This will give him a
plurality over John .B. Stanchfield of
91,830, which is 121,162 less than the plu
rality given to former Governor Black
in 1896. Though in every county the esti
mates show a decrease more or less
marked, in the Republican majorities Mc-
Kinley, outside of Greater New York and
the county of Schoharle. will have plu
ralities aggregating 147,360. Bryan will
probably have a surplus in three
counties. Schoharie alone stood by
him in 1S26 with a plurality of
865. The county will probably give him
a majority of 500 votes this year. Tam
many.will turn the adverse majority or
20,735 in 1S96 Into a plurality of 30.000 this
year. Richmond will add 1200 men to tho
Bryan column. It gave McKinley a sur
plus of 171S in 1S96. These are the only
counties in which there is any prospect
that Mr. Bryan will poll more votes than
Mr. McKinley. In many counties the Re
publican pluralities of the last Presiden
tial election will be cut in two, or nearly
so. In many others the vote will hold
well up to the record-breaking figures of
four- years ago. Generally speaking, the
Republican strength is greatest In the
eastern and northern parts of the State.
Careful estimates made by correspond
ents who have traversed every county in
the State, consulting the best available
sources of information, give President

Beckham this year, as there la no inde

Upon # the face of the. returns Governor

received a, plurality of 2511. In addition

In a national campaign without any

This year, however, the State flght, has so
overshadowed the national election that
very little interest is shown in the latter,
and candidates and campaign, managers
confine their efforts to rallying the voters
upon State questions.
There is reason to believe that had the
intentions of the voters been recorded per
fectly the State would have gone for
Bryan by a very -small plurality instead
of for McKinley. When a ballot is pre
pared in. Kentucky the the law requires
that each name shall be marked. Some of
the Democratic voters marked the flrst
named Democratic Elector, believing this
carried 'a vote for the entire electoral

Kentucky will probably give her thir

Mr. Bryan has gained many gold Demo
crats who were against him in 1S96. The
Bryan Democratic managers declare that
90 per cent of the wanderers are. back "in
the fold. Averaging up the localities, it
is probable that a majority of the gold
Democrats are supporting Bryan. The
Germans are to be classed with the gold
Democrats. The ballots will show'that in
localities where previous to 1896 they were
Democrats most of the Germans have re
turned to their party. Mr. Bryaa-has
made headway with his anti-trust cam
paign talk, but will do better with 'that
two yoars later. It is having influence in
spots where the local* factories have been
closed by the trusts. When Bryan was In
the gas belt and told the high protection
workingmen there that he would take the
tariff off articles controlled by the trusts
this was heralded* by the Republicans as
a case of political suicide. But there is a
large tariff reform element in Indiana
wblch is for the gold standard and yet Is
very independent, and Bryan helped him
self with this class. There is ajso much
restlessness among the small merchants
on this question. These are symptoms of
discontent which do not seem to be chang
ing votes by wholesale' in the present
campaign, though storing up for the fu
ture. In looking for the positive elements
of Mr. Bryan's strength a second trip was
made into the southern counties along the
Ohio River and was contlrmed in the' be
lief that most of those Democratic-coun
ties will do better for him than they did
in 1896. But the aggregate increase will
not be large, the voting population not
having increased in any marked degree.
Against this Is the certain increase of Re
publican majorities in the great; Repub
lican counties in the central and northern
part of the State, as well as in the south
eastern part. The chief fact' about these
counties is that the voting population has
largely Increased. The farmers are more
strongly for McKinley. It is rare to find a
Republican farmer in revolt. Apparently
a good many who leaned to silver and
who quietly voted for Bryan four years
ago are now in line.

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RE
PUBLICAN NATIONAL COM
MITTEE.
Indiana farmers are resolving the doubt
about the vote of the State. Their reso
lution is In favor of McKinley. This,
taken with the better" organization of the
Republicans, Justifies stating that while
Indiana must be looked upon as doubtful
until sundown of election day the pros
pects aro for McKinley securing the fif
teen electoral votes. The Democratic
State organization is showing marked
signs of improvement, yet at the. best it
cannot by November 6 more than equal
the Republican organization as It has been
for ninety days. There are some uncer
tainties, however, which leave the State
In the doubtful column. A week of mu&
and rain; a raw, disagreeable election day
would cloud the Republican prospectcs at
the very last minute. Having staked ev
erything on the farmer vote, they have
to meet the possibility of meteorological
conditions which would make a portion of
the farmers indifferent about going to the
polls. The farmer vote is put first be
cause it is the most potent element. If
the Republican hopes regarding < it prove
ill founded, then the State is going for
Bryan, and no strength of party organi
zation can s^ye Indiana. Bryan Jn 1S28
held the country vote* remarkably well.
It was the towns and cities which went
heavily against him. This year the con-
to Go for McKinley.
Farmers Expected to Cause the State
INDIANA.
The understanding now is that J. Kd
ward Addicks cannot be elected to the
United States Senate without the aid of
Democratic legislators. If the regular Re
publicans hold the balance of power in
the General Assembly there may be an
other deadlock, with the State of Dela
ware unrepresented In the Senate.
At the next session of the General As
sembly efforts are to be made to elect two
United States Senators, one to fill the va
cancy caused by the appointment of Judge
Gray and the other to succeed ' Senator
JOnney. If the Republican factions in
Kent and Sussex counties do not corne to
gether the Democrats will control the
General "Assembly on joint ballot. Har
mony in Kent County seems to be hope
less. If the factions vote together in Sus
sex County thr-y may elect six Instead of
four candidates to the House.
The contest for the control of the Gen
eral Assembly overshadows everything
else, and as a result the full Republican
vote will be polled. Harmony reigns over
the Addicks end nntl-Addicks forces. The
torms Union Repubicans and Regular Re
publicans are on the ticket for Presi
dential electors and State officers, but in
the choice of candidates for the General
Assembly fierce competition prevails. At
the joint primaries In Newcastle County
the anti-Addicks men won two of the
three candidates for the Senate and
twelve of the fifteen candidates for the
House. In the other counties each fac
tion nominated candidates. .
Istratlon have not given them much com
fort. In Wilmington particularly and in
the counties the registration until now
has been in favor of the Republican party
âin Wilmington by more than 2500. Reg
istration is to be completed to-day.
To. the Editor of The Call: Con
ditions in Nebraska Indicate posi
tively that Bryan will carry the
State by an increased majority.
The German vote is solidly for
Bryan this year, whereas four
years ago it was largely for Mc-
Kinley. I am inclined to think he
will carry the State by about
24,000.
The 'entire fusion ticket will be
elected.' and while the fight is like
ly be close on the Legislature,
everything points to fusion suc
cess in that direction. If* the Re
publicans elect" two of- the' six
Representatives from Nebraska
they will be doing well.
The organization of the Repub
lican managers in the State is very
good and they have an abundance
of money to arrange things, but
even that will not save them. Talk
of McKimey carrying the State of
Nebraska is folly.

Confirmation of Destruction of Mis-
WASH1XGTOK, Oct. 20.â The State De
partment has received a dispatch from the
Consul at Chefu, under date of September
9, transmitting an account, based on ap
1-arently trustworthy information from
Chinese sources, of the massacre of mis
sionaries In ShansI province.
According to the account on June 28

These persons were driven from their
homes into the mountains and later ar
rested and taken to Taiyuen and pre
sumably akilled.
By June 20 most of the foreipn houses

CANAL PROJECTED
TO HEAET OF LONDON
Will Enable Steamers Now Landing
at Southampton to Discharge
Passengers in the
I Metropolis.
LONDON. Oct. 30.â The latest and most
important project on foot In England is
the construction of a canal from South
ampton to London. The surmise as to
the far-reaching consequences such a step
would entail is scarcely less interesting
than the fact that If it Is accomplished It
is likely to be through the instrumentality
of American capital. Coming on top of
London's adoption of the American transit
system and the utilization of American
money and brains, this latest project may
well be said to cap the climax. The route
from Southampton to London has been
carefully surveyed by competent engi
neers, who declare that the canal is not
only feasible but that It could be built at
a comparatively small expense. The
whole matter ha8 Just been put In the
hands of the same firm of contractors
which is handling Charles T. Yerkes 1 new
London railway.
The opposition encountered by the pro
moters of the Manchester ~-<1 Liverpool
ship canal, in Parliament and elsewhere,
would practically be as nothing to the
jealous efforts of other cities in the same
direction In this case, for since the Amer
ican line steamers made Southampton
their port 'of call Southampton has so Im
proved itself and haÂ» *o affected the trade
of other ports that It Is already regarded
with a jealous eye. That commercial rev
olutions will ensue from a ship canal en
abling tranp-Atlantlc and other liners to
land their passengers in the heart of Lon
don many hours earlier than by any other
route can easily be Judged by the grow
ing popularity of the smaller steamship
lines now salllntr direct from London by
the slow and difficult way of the Thames.
OSCAB WILDE NEAR DEATH.
Undergoes a : Surgical Operation in
a. Paris Hospital.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â The "World has
this from Paris: Oscar Wilde was taken
to a hospital a few days ago. Yesterday
he underwent a surgical operation, and
he is now lying dangerously near dÂ«ath
at the Hospital La Salpetrlere.
Since making Paris his home, the Eng
lish poet' and playwright has been sub
ject to . many hardships. Lately he has
been almost absolutely destitute. lie has
grown bloated and absolutely helpless. A
few admirers .of his former. talent kept
him alive by charity. If he recovers,
Wilde will go to Scotland, where he has
been offered a home.
w OXDOX, Oct. 21.â The agreement
R between Great Britain and Ger
Â¦ ' many to maintain the territorial ln
.^Mritegrily-of China, while it savors of
independent action and will doubt
less be adhered to despite the protest' of
any other power. Is not looked upon here
as forming an obstacle to the progress of
negotiations upon the basis laid down in
the last French note, or Indeed upon any
proposition which will, not Infringe upon
the essential principles of the-Anglo-Ger
man compact.
The Associated Press is informed that
Lord Salisbury's reservations or recom
mendations, as he prefers to have them
called, when answering the recent notes,
especially that of France, all bid fair to
be accepted in toto or to result in, such
modifications that Great Britain will be
assured that territorial integrity will be
conserved and will be able to join whole
heartedly in the negotiations which may
already be said to be started in Peking.
In short, apart from the gratification
over the agreement with "Germany, a
much more hopeful spirit is evinced at
the Foreign Office at tne end of this week
than was shown last week ovep the pros
pect of a successful termination of the
negotiations and the belief that they will
not be dragged out over such^an Inter
minable period as to render ineffective an
eventual decision. Thore Is no effort to
conceal the fact that the new compact
is practically a repetition of Secretary-
Hay's "open door" note to . the powers,
though it Is pointed out that general con
sent to a principle differs greatly from
the publicly expressed determination of
two great powers to uphold it at all cost.
That Lord Salisbury should have select
ed Germany, or vice versa, to be a party
in this pronouncement is taken to be nign
lv significant of the close .relations be
tween .the two powers in Question and
may almost be said to constitute an al
liance, which, for purposecs of the imme
diate future, bids fair to bring Germany
into even closer touch with Great Britain
than she is with the other members of
the triple alliance, though it can be safe
ly asserted that Austria and Italy will
readily accept any invitation to concur
in *the principle enunciated by the Lord
Salisbury-Hatzfeld agreement. That the
United States will follow suit Is taken here
as a foregone conclusion, while the Brit
ish Foreign Office expects Japan and
hopes France will do the same. Russia,
of course, is a difficult factor In the situ
ation, but it is not believed that she will
stand out against the world, especially in
the face of such a patently aggressive
alliance as was announced to-day.

ALLIANCE OF
ENGLAND AND
THE KAISER
NEW YORK. Oct. 20.â The Journal
has this from London: ,Great
Britain and Germany have form
ed an alliance and England is
ordering her great fleet to get
ready for sea. The alliance ostensibly is
for the purpose of preventing the parti
tion of China and the preservation of the
open door of that empire, but there are
many things to indicate that it is a more
far-reaching and comprehensive compact
than appears on the surface.
It has just come out that the German
Emperor defeated a scheme on the part
of France and Russia to prevent England
reaping the fruits of her victory over the
Boers. The Kaiser expressed himself
convinced that German interests de
manded that the Boer republics be wiped
out and become part and parcel of the
British empire. .
Russia and France are especially aimed
at iqthls alliance. Russia, in spite of all
her protestations that she does not In
tend to keep any territory.. is not believed.
Statesmen know that, having taken Man
churia, she will hold It, and France will
back her up in this. It is to prevent any
such partition of China that England and
Germany have Joined hands.
Orders have been issued by the Admir
alty that all reserve warships must be
ready for sea at once. The country is to
be prepared for any emergency in view
of tne announcement of the alliance with
Germany.

' It bears on its cover the significant title,
"My Relations AVith His Majesty Em
peror William II," by Countess Hermann
von Wedel.
The Countess, whose maiden name was
Emily Elizabeth Bearard, was divorced
Just a year before the Kaiser ascended
the throne from Count Hermann Wedel,
and owing to the manner In which the
Kaiser, , then only Prince William, was
Justly or unjustly made to figure in the
proceedings' Count Hermann has found It
more convenient , to live permanently
abroad since then, although the fact that
he retains a commission In tfte army and
a membership In the . sovereign Order of
Malta indicates that ! his conduct in the
entire affair was in complete accordance
with the laws of honor.
"What especially . annoys and dis
tresses the Emperor Is that the book in
question, which is certain to receive wide
publicity, conveys the impression that the
relations between the Emperor and the
Countess have continued since his acces
sion to the throne, an Imputation which
he resents.

CAUSES WILLIAM
MUCH ANNOYANCE
BERLIX, Oct. rO.â Count von Bu
low's accession to the Imperial
chancellorship and Prince Hohen
lohe's retirement still form the
all-absorbing topics here. Con
cerning the precise character of the scenes
in Homburg leading to the retirement of
Prince Hohenlohe, no authoritative state
ment has as yet appeared nor probably
will any appear. Private accounts differ.
The general Impression now Is that Prince
Hohenlohe's leaving office was not entire
ly voluntary, although Emperor William
did everything to "sugar tho pill." to the
tottering old man, who. until the last, he
dubbed "Uncle Chlodwlgr," and addressed
with the familiar "thou."
It leaks out that Count von Bulow him
self wired the Cologne Gazette the news
of bis appointment from Homburg and
that the final turn of affairs was only de
cided on late Wednesday. This explains
why Berlin Government circles remained
in ignorance of the change in Chancellors
until the decision.
Count von Bulow's position as Imperial
Chancellor will be beset with extreme dil
ticulties, and will require perhaps more
diplomatic skill than statesmanship.
Not alone will his Majesty want to con
tinue to be his own chancellor and exer
cise the right of ceaseless interference,
even in the most delicate matters, but
there will be also great parliamentary
difficulties; to overcome. The Agrarians
from the outset regard Von Bulow suspi
ciously, owing to his record hitherto, as
desirous to maintain friendly relations not
only with Russia but also with the United
States . and Great Britain, thus opposing
the tariff war which the Agrarians de
sire. To carry through the Reichstag the
commercial treaties now under way will
tax Von Bulow's full energy and genius.
At the best Von Bulow, like Bismarck,
will only be able to make politics "von
fall zu fall" (literally, from case to case â
meaning that the new Chancellor will act
in each case as It cornea up). In other
words, he will not follow a general politi
cal programme, but will be unfettered.
Private advices received by the Cologne
Volks Zeltung, the leading Catholic or
gan, say Viceroy Chang Chi Tung contin
ues wholesale executions in Hankow of
anti-dynastic plotters. Forty- two men
have been beheaded and the anti-Chris
tian riots in that province have been
stopped. But In the province of Honan
every church, chapel and Â¦ congregation
has been destroyed and the Christians
murdered, except in one church, where a
Bishop and a number of missionaries
barricaded themselves and have hitherto
successfully resisted all attacks.
BALTIMORE. Md.. Oct. 20.â Governor
Roosevelt , spoke here to*night to as
many people as could get within the
range of his voice. He addressed two
meetings, one outside, the other Inside of
Music Hall, the largest auditorium in the
city, and everything he said met with en
thusiastic applause.
Governor Roosevelt was In fair voice
and made his . points with hlg usual
vigor and emphasis. His reference to
Senator Wellington was" received with
mingled hisses and applause and when he
ppoke of Mr. Bryan there was much
cheering and stamping of feet. Aside
from this there were no interruptions,
which was contrary to expectations.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 20.â The United

city is looking for R. M. Gay of San Fran

false affidavit, the object of which was to
obtain the lands of the Wabash Mining
Company, In Fresno County.
Â¦ Dr. J. H. Bryant, who Is at the head of
the syndicate owning the Wabash proper
ty, is said to have testified to Gay's alleged
perjury. Good faith mining operations
have been carried on by Dr. Bryant and
his associates since the lands were claimed.
and from a sworn statement tiled by the
president of the Wabash Company In the
United States land office at Stockton, It
appears that work has been accomplished
amounting to $30,000. *

Tags.
VANCOUVER. Oct. 20.â An. old hat dec
orated with 138 tags has arrived In Van
couver by the steamship Empress of Ja

wonderful travels. It was sent from Eas
ton, Pa., to San Francisco on August 2
1899. Tag No. 1 reads: "Dear Friendsâ '
Please ship my hat to San Francisco and
return It to me." A young lady started it
on its long Journey at Easton, Pa.
The hat comes from . South Africa and

It has been traveling ever since. It was
tagged every important city in the
States, reached Montreal on Its return

London, reached â¢ there on Mateking day
and was nicknamed "Paul Kruger'*
Crown." It reached Hongkong by wav of
the. Red Sea and sailed via Hongkong to
Vancouver, missing the Australian boat
by one day. It will be sent to the Klon

Some of the witticisms and rhymes on
the tags are very good and the unknown
lady who started out the hat has received
three proposals of marriage on the tags.
The hat' has been one year and three
months wandering, around the" world.

SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 20.â In the ar
rest of a woman who gives her name as
Ruby Brown, the police believe they
have captured the leader of a gang of
thieves which has been operating ln this
vicinity of late.
Suspicion was directed to her and a raid
made on her room. A miscellaneous col
lection of goods was. found ln her room
and seized by the police to be UBed as
evidence. The 'woman is remarkably
handsome and well dressed and wears a
quantity of Jewelry. â¢ -
Last Thursday there was a case of shop
lifting: that was thought to be merely* an
ordinary Police Court case like dozens of
others. Two men went Into a clothing
store. While one bought an inexpensive
article the other, made. off with two valu
able overcoats. The thief evidently
passed the goods over to another party.
The coats were recovered, but the thief
was not caught. A. Mexican from Oxnard
was arrested on suspicion. He proved his
innocence; but told the officers there was
a gang of shoplifters in town. He said
the thieves had headquarters at Oxnard,
where they sold stuff they had stolen
from Riverside, Redlands, Pasadena,
Los Angeles and other places. The clev
erest one of the lot, he aaid, was a very
handsome young woman, the others being
Mexicans. In the evening several cases
of shoplifting were reported.
This morning an officer, saw two of the
Mexicans enter a ehoestore. Soon one
came out. He was arrested and found to

denly this afternoon. Mr. War-.

Last spring he had pneumonia again
while at his home, and this had weakened
his heart. Of late he had been much bet
ter.
At noon to-day Mr. Warner attended a
luncheon to bid farewell to some friends
about to leave for the Mediterranean. He
was cheerful and gave no Indication of
illness. After luncheon Mr. Warner start
ed on a walk. Among his acquaintances
was a colored man. to whom he gave
books to encourage his desire to read, par
ticularly books connected with the history
of the colored race, upon which Mr. War
ner was an authority. Mr. Warner prob
ably intended to call on this man. as he
was in the neighborhood of his house
when he was stricken. Probably feeling
111. he asked leave at a house to sit down,
then to He down, requesting to be called
in ten minutes. When the woman of the
house went to call him he was dead.
News of his sudden death spread rapidly
and was a great shock to his many
friends.

In the third inning Sacramento saw the
scoreboy playing with numbers against
Its name on the board. After Stultz made
the first bag Devereaux trotted into the
running by an error of Francks. The
baps were soon filled, when Sheehan took
his base on four bad ones. Stanley swat
ted the ball to FYancks, who guillotined
Sheehan at second, but Stanley escaped
punishment at first and Stultz scored.
Devereaux scored on the play to catch
Stanley between the bags. In the seventh
McLauphlln, who went to .first on a body
blow, scored on moth-eaten throwing. In
the last inning McLaughlin rolled out a
three-bagger, scoring later on a poor
throw of Francks. The score;
Jay Hughes and Dr. Moskiman per
formed In creditable fashion yesterday
afternoon at Recreation grounds. Their
slab work was of fine quality, particularly
that of the champion twirler, who allowed
but six hits, struck seven men out and
walked one. Their playing was the fea
ture of the game outside of a single in
jection of bad luck into the Dudes'
chances of winning.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20.â The fall race
meeting of the Sixth District Agricultural
Association opened at Agricultural Park
this afternoon. A light shower this morn
ing put the track In splendid shape for the
runners, but It was rather cuppy for the
harness horses. The weather was per
fect and over E000 people were in attend
ance.
Considerable Interest was centered in
the free-for-all pace, which was won by
Gaylord's Coney in straight heats, his
best time being- 2:08. The admirers of
Anaconda were much Sisappointed at his
showing. He did not appear to be in the
best condition and could do no better
than come second, which he succeeded in
doing In the. last heat.
Richmond Chief took first monev in the
2:15 trot, winning in straight heats from
Belle Patchen, who should have captured
the flrst heat, but she broke at the draw
gate and was beaten half a length.
In the mile race Stromo, a 3V6 to 1
chance, galloped in, winning by two
lengths.
The three-quarters of a mile race was
a real pretty race. Good Hope, at 2 to 1
winning by a nose> from Alaria, the fa
vorite, in a whiplng finish.
Flush of Gold, the favorite, landed the
Derby, beating Cue, the second choice by
half a length. '
Grafter, who was selected by the talent
in the four furlong dash, took the money
away from Screenwell Lake in a close
and exciting finish. Summary:

constipation.
The stomach is the vital center of the
body. It is the organ from which all
other organs are fed. A -weak stomach
means a weak. man. There never was a
strong man with a weak stomach. What
is called " weak stomach " is in general a
diseased condition of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition,
which prevents the proper digestion of
the food which is taken into the stom-
ach, and so reduces the nutrition of the
body. When all food is taken away the
body starves. 4 When the food eaten is
only digested and assimilated in part it
only nourishes the body in part, and so
the body is partly starved. And this
starvation is felt in every organ of the
body dependent on the blood which is
made from food.
The great variety of the cures per-
formed by Dr. Pierce' s Golden -Medical
Discovery is due to its remarkable
power to heal diseases of the stomach
and allied organs. It cures through the
stomach diseases seemingly remote, but
which have their origin in a diseased
condition of the stomach and the other
organs of digestion and nutrition.
" Weak " heart, lungs, kidneys and weak-
ness of other organs is cured with the
cure of the weak stomach.
Mr. Thom&s A. S warts. Box 103, Sab-Station
C-. Columbus, Ohio, writes: "I 'was taken very.
sick with w-rrrc headache, then cramps in the
stomach, and f iod would not digest, then kidney 'Â¦. .
and liver trouble, and my back got vreak so I
could scarcely get around. The more I doctored ,
the worse I got until six years paused. I had be-
come so poorly I could only walk in the house
by the aid of a chair, and I got so thin I had
given up to die, thinking that I could not be
cured. Then one of my neighbors Â«ld, ' Take
Dr. Pi tree's Colden Medical Discovery and make
a new man out of yourself.' The first bottle,
helped me Â«o I thought I would get another, and
after I had taken eight bottles I was weighed .
and found I had rained twenty-seven (27) lbs. .
in about Â«ix weeks. I have done more hard
work in the past eleven months than I did in
two years before, and I am as stout and healthy
to-day, I think, as I ever was."

AN" excellent idea of how the charter is inter
preted by our esteemed friends, the Phelan re
formers, when it interferes with their political
plans may be gathered from an estimate placed upon
one of its provisions by the Examiner.
A few days ago City Attorney Lane sent an opinion
to the Supervisors in which he wiforms them that they
possess no power to disburse the anticipated sur
phis of $200,000 prior to the termination of the fisc.il
year. Animated probably by a desire to expend this
money in behalf of some political movement having
for its object the establishment of a new "reform,"
the Examiner says it is not sure of the soundness of
the Attorney's opinion. It is inclined to believe that
moneys raised for the general fund and not otherwise
appropriated are at the disposition of the Supervisors
by special appropriation whenever it is established
that such moneys exist, and it adds that this is "a
matter for the courts to decide."
This is charter reform law with a vengeance. The
charter provides that in June of every year the Super
visors shall, upon estimates furnished by the Auditor,
fix appropriations for the ensuing fiscal term in a bill
called the "budget." This measure, after passage, is
signed by the Mayor and becomes the sheet anchor of
all subsequent financial operations.
Section 6, chapter 1, article III of the charter says
that "except as otherwise provided in this charter, no
money shall be drawn from the treasury unless in con
sequence of appropriations made by the Supervisors
and upon warrants duly drawn thereon by thcAudi
tor." And section 7, immediately following, says that
"no warrants shall bÂ» drawn except upon an unex
hausted SPECIFIC appropriation." But as if these
piovisions were not sufficient to ease the itching palms
of the "reformers," the charter adds, in another sec
tion of the same article:
It Bhall not bft lawful for the Supervisors, or for any
beard, department, oiUccr or authority having power to
Incur, authorize or contract liabilities against the treas
ury, to incur, authorize, allow, contract for, pay or ren
der payable in the present or future, In any one month,
any expenditure, demand or djmands, against any ap
propriation, which, taken with all other expenditures,
Indebtedness or liability made or Incurred up to the time
In such month of making or Incurring the same, shall
exceed one-twelfth part of the amount of the appropria
tion for tho fiscal year.
Exactly upon what ground, in the face of this posi
tive law, the Examiner bases its belief that the Super
visors can expend money in excess of the "budget"
we are unable to comprehend. These provisions of
the charter would seem to settle the proposition be
jond the pcradventure of a doubt.
Of course we recognize the fact that the existence
! in the treasury of a surplus of $200,000 is a sore temp-

The Duke of Marlborough need not concern him
self seriously in reference to the extent of his popu
larity at home. An English preacher recently de
nounced \V. K. Vanderbilt for giving his daughter
$500,000 as a thank offering for the safe return of the
Duke from South Africa.
AMONG thÂ« deserving candidates for the Su
perior Court no voter of this city who has any
property or takes the least interest in its wel
fare should fail to vote for Judge Coffey. During
his long years of faithful service upon the bench the
people have learned to respect and honor him for the
Â£.bility, integrity and devotion to duty which have
marked his judicial caieer. No scandal has ever hung
c\cr his courtroom. Xo estates have been despoiled
which came under his jurisdiction. Just recently the
people of this city have been startled by the extra
ordinary and unusual proceedings in the Piper es
tate, by which, nearly a year after the regular will was
admitted to probate, over a quarter of a million was
paid to quiet demands made under an alleged will
which was not only never proven but not even filed
in court. Under this same document, if genuine, the
part)', who is said to have received the sum of $ioo,
ooo in settlement would have been entitled to prop
erty estimated to be worth about two millions. Com
ment is unnecessary. There can be but one opinion
about the transaction. Would a man accent five per
cer.t in satisfaction of a legacy to which he believed
himself lawfully entitled? In this disbursement of a
Quarter of a million there T^as an item of over $50,000
credited as going to a "syndicate." It has never
transpired who composed this "syndicate" or for what
purpose such a large sum was paid. The inquiry nat
urally arises if there is an organization in this city to
loot estates. Certainly every citizen who has prop
erty which may pass through probate is interested in
having Judges who will not permit such spoliations.
Judge Coffey has been tried and never found wanting.
No "syndicate" could ever carry on its operations
in his court. The only opposition to him so far heard
of, besides the "push," which is naturally against an
henest man, comes from attorneys who have not suc
ceeded in obtaining all the "traffic would bear" and
are sore because their claims have been scaled down
by this fearless Judge. Let the people roll up such a
majority for Judge Coffey that other men of like
character may be encouraged to accept judicial posi
tions, and it may go abroad that the citizens generally
of San Francisco prefer an honest man if they can get
a chance to vote for one. There are men in nomina
tion for judicial positions this year who arc mentally
and morally unfit for the bench. All 6orts of political
tricks and jobs, such as "plumping" and false count
ing, will be resorted to by the unprincipled classes in
order that one or two of these men may be slipped in
so that the "syndicates" maj' have a place to continue
their operations. Let no friend of Judge Coffey relax
ia vigilance.

Against the schemes and the methods of the cor
poration and the bosses the loyal Republicans of the
district have made an effective protest by bringing
about the nomination of Mr. Sutro as the candidate
in that district of the Citizens' Republican Conven
tion. These men are for honesty in office, for straight
politics, and all that means genuine Republicanism.
Sc the issue has been joined, and it is now for the
voters of the district to decide. A vote for Sutro will
be 1 a vote for a representative of the people. A vote
for Dibble will be a vote for a representative of Kelly
and Crimmins and a tool of the Southern Pacific cor
poration, f
It is well known that the Southern Pacific Company
and the bosses whom it maintains to handle ward poli
tics desire to control the coming Legislature in order
that the corporation and the bosses may arrange the
Congressional, Senatorial and Assembly districts of
the State under the new census. Should they suc
ceed in doing so they can so gerrymander the city
and the State as to have an immense advantage in all
political contests for ten years to come. Henry C.
Dibble will be of great use to the corporations in that
work should he be elected to the Assembly. It is for
that reason they are back of him. It is for that rea
son the Democratic push was so willing to help Crim
mins and Kelly in their efforts to procure his renomi
nation.
The Call has made no fight upon Mr. Dibble other
than that of publishing the record he has made for
himself. It has recalled to public attention some of
the old scandals like that of "the wastebasket," and
the allegations of Captain Frank Barrett concerning
the money he paid, under the advice of his attorney,
Elwood Bruner of Sacramento, to promote the pas
sage through the Assembly of a perfectly honest and
thoroughly desirable bill. These scandals show what
manner of man Mr. Dibble is and reveal what are his
purposes and objects in politics. In opposition to
them neither Mr. Dibble nor his friends have been
able to show any worthy actions or public spirited in
icnt on his part at any point of his long and tortuous
political career. '
No intelligent Republican can regard Dibble's de
feat as any loss to the party. It will not affect the
choice of Presidential electors, of Republican Con
gressmen, or mate'rially change the party control of
the State' Legislature. The only effects sure to result
from it are a repudiation of Kelly and Crimmins, a
rebuke to boss domination and trickery in Republican
primaries, the elimination of a corporation tool from
the Legislature, and i. distinct victory for honest
politics.
With the action of the Citizens' Republican Conven
tion in nominating Mr. Sutro The Call has the full
est sympathy. That movement tends to the elimina
tion from the Legislature of one of the worst per
sonal influences in our politics and the defeat of boss
rule and hoodlum trickery in Republican politics. It
is therefore a movement for the good of the Repub
lican party and for the good of the State. It is one
meriting the support of every loyal Republican in the
district. No better service can be rendered to the
cause of Republicanism in that Assembly district than
the defeat of Dibble. He has never been in any true
sense a representative of the party or of the con
stituency. He stands first for Dibble and next for the
bosses and the corrupt corporations, whose schemes
he knows how to render profitable to himself.
VOTERS of the Forty-first Assembly District
have in this election to choose whether they
shall be represented in the Legislature by
Oscar Sutro, a young man of known ability and in
tegrity, nominated not only by the Democrats of the^
district but by the Citizens' Republican Convention,
or Henry C. Dibble, well known as "a crooked poli
tician," nominated by Kelly and Crimmins by the aid
of such members of the Democratic "push" as could
be induced to help them override the Republican pri
maries. It is, in other words, a choice between a rep
resentative of the taxpayers and good citizens of both
p.-irties and a candidate of the bosses and the "gang3 M
cf both parties.

CALIFOBNIANS IN" NEW TOBK.
It appears from this that Bryan, after having tried
the silver issue, the imperial issue, the trust issue and
the government by injunction issue, has at last de
cided to make his fight solely on the "Declaration of
Independence. , As no party in the country Is attack
ing or is likely to attack that document, his latest
move has. in it something of the strategy that seeks
a safe place before the storm comes. - The Declara
tion contains great general principles, upon which all
Americans are agreed. In taking his stand upon
it Mr. Bryan admits he is running for office solely
upon general principles! He is young yet and has a
prospect of making several more runs of the game
kind. We wish the Silver Lincoln Republicans as
much of joy as they can get out of their candidate,
ana may he and they live long to enliven the politi
cal campaigns of the people.
. Instead of speaking out boldly and exhorting them
in the common faith of free coinage, Bryan wrote to
the silverites: "In 1896 the money question was the
question of paramount importance, but the Repub
lican party, by its disregard of the principles of our
republic and by its advocacy of policies repugnant to
the doctrines of self-government, has left us no choice
but to summon all- levers of the Declaration of In
dependence to the defense of that sacred document
and the constitution framed in accordance with it."
These self-styled "Silver Lincoln Republicans" have
no political faith save a fanatic devotion to silver.
They are men who have been firmly on the side of
Republicanism on every issue growing out of the war
and the reconstruction period, and upon all questions
of tariff regulation. They are sound protectionists.
They have no use for Bryan except as he represents
free silver coinage, and yet in accepting their nomi
nation Bryan had nothing to say to them on that sub
ject further than to send them .his back number docu
ments with the declaration, "Them V my sentiments."
BRYflN TO THE SILVER MEN.
AT last, after much delay, Bryan has paused in
his career of stump speaking long enough to
send to the so-called "Silver Lincoln Repub
lican" party his acceptance of their nomination for
the Presidency. His letter was short, but he accom
panied it by a bundle of documents which he beggsd
them to accept as part of his letter. The documents
are his Indianapolis speech in reply to the Demo
cratic notification committee, his letter formally ac
cepting the Democratic nomination, his speech ac
cepting the Populist nomination, and finally his ad
dress at St. Louis on the trust question. It is to be
hoped the silver men will be satisfied with those docu
ments. Certainly they will find very little to satisfy
them in the letter that went with them.

PERSONAL MENTION.
recently been making the round of the
New York theaters.
"Our first attempt was 'Ben Hur.' The
house was crowded even at this late day
of the engagement; very enthusiastic, too;
but such poor acting I was surprised to
see. The hero meant well and acted so
hard that beads of perspiration be
spangled his manly brow, but even this
effort couldn't atone for the shrill voices
of the women and the ranting of the
men. The scene In the galley was truly
Impressive, chiefly because there was lit
tle said and the fine scenery had a chance
to make an impression. The chariot race
was really funny, though not so funny
as the cheering audience, who applauded
a wall circling wildly about eight horses
working a treadmill.
"Next we went to see Drew in 'Richard
Carvel.' The dramatization is poor. No
one who has not read the book could
make out what story the adapter is trying
to tell. Drew acted well, of course, but
he 2s no more Richard Carvel than, say,
Mr. Hartman Is. In the London scene
Richard fights every one In sight and
kills almost a dozenjet a stroke. Every
one on the stage kfl^s making remarks
as to his marvelous strength and size, but
no amount of padding can conceal the
fact that more than one of his enemies
towers above him.
"The finest thing* I have seen here is
Sothern's 'Hamlet.' and this despite the
fact that Mies Harned makes a mature
and unconvincing Ophelia and that ths
rest of the support la poor. I have rpad
no critiques of Sothern's performance, bur
to me it seemed a wonderfully fine and
conscientious piece of work.
" 'The Pride of Jennico' has a wlldl7
Improbable and highly sensational plot,
v.ith a last act rich In banditti, shooting
and a blare of glory that covers the hero \
and heroine at C. I was grievously tli^ap- I
pointed In Jlactcett. Of course a few sea
sons of matinee-Idol experience would
tpoil any man, much more an actor, but
such a conceited fellow I have never seen.
Ho plays at the audience all the time:
his two great and continually alternating
acts are fighting wildly and embracing
the heroine more wildly. Whenever tho
audience applauds mildly he stops wher
ever he happens to be and smiles hia
thanks across the footlights.
"Mansfield's 'Henry V ia the most beau
tifully staged thing I have ever seen. The
fourth act is especially gorgeous; it closes
with a splendid tableau â the Kin? seated
on his war horse, surrounded by his army
and hl3 people. â¢ â¢ â¢ Mr. Mansfield does
not look the part at all and speaks hl3
lines as if In constant worry lest the next
scenic effect will not come oft properly.
The people here seem to bo with him. no
natter what he does, and applauded gen
erously; but he would answer no curtain
calls, though once they clapped all
through the intermission between two
acts (and no short one at that)."
MAURICE GRAU, THE GREATEST LIVING MANAGER 07 GRAND OP
ERA. HIS COMPANY OF ARTISTS IS NOW ON ITS WAT TO THIS
CITY.
ONE of the happiest effects of the prosperity re
sulting from the adoption of Republican poli
cies on the part of the people and the Govern
ment has been the payment of mortgages upon real
estate and the establishment of thousands^of indus
trious workingmen in homes of their own free from
any incumbrance. Hardly any burden is more oppres
sive to the wage-earner than a debt upon his home,
a mortgage that goes on drawing interest whether the
worker draw wages or not, and whose obligations
must be met whatever else may be evaded; and when
these burdens are lifted the people are truly pros
perous.
The extent to which mortgages have been paid off
in this State, over and above the amounts of new
mortgages made during the year is shown in the re
cently published report of the Bank Commissioners.
On August 31, 1898, the savings, commercial and pri
vate banks of California had loans on real estate
amounting in value to $111,228,350, but on July 31,
1899, the amounts of loans so secured were only $107,
104.395. Thus within eleven months there was a
diminution in the value of such loans to the extent
of $4,178,954.
National banks do not lend money on land, but
when times are bad they frequently come into the pos
session of real estate, which they afterward sell to the
people for homes or for business purposes. In this
State the report of the Bank Commissioners shows
that the national banks had on August 31, 1898, real
estate other than bank premises valued at $838,253, but
on July 31; 1899, the value of such real estate was only
$799,202, being a decrease to the amount of $39,050 in
the space of eleven months.
It is not in (.California only that these good results
are to be found. Evidence similar to that furnished
by the report of our Bank Commissioners comes from
all parts of the Union. George L. Warren, president
of the Chicago Real Estate Board, recently stated:
"From the best information I am able to obtain, and
from general observation, I believe that during the
past four years more wage-earners have purchased
homes for themselves than for years previous."
Another real estate report from the same city says:
"The business of selling homes to working people is
now just about 100 per cent better than it was in 1897.
the year of greatest depression. in Chicago's real estate
history. After four years of these good Republican
times there are hundreds of buyers of homes by peo
ple who used to lead a hand-to-mouth existence,
whose quarters were close and stuffy, whose children
knew little air or sunshine, and naught but filthy alleys
to play in. To sell lots in the outlying districts it is
now only necessary to build houses on them, ranging
from $1000 to $3000 in price. More buyers are pay
ing larger amounts of cash on these houses thanever
before."
With such records as these coming from all parts of
the country, the people may well be satisfied with the
effects of the policies of the administration. Prosper
ity that enables the wage-earner to own his home,
and which increases the number of such homes all
over the Union, is worth having, worth working for
and worth voting for.
PAYING OFF MORTGAGES.
It is extremely likely that the voters of the Forty
first Assembly District will not have the same reluc
tance, in expressing their opinion of Henry C. Dibble
as has Ehvood Bruner, who was paid money with
which to purchase Dibble's only value as an Assem
blyman.
Yet we all want to know what is going
on in New York, especially at this sea
son when the new productions are being
made. I consider myself fortunate, then.
In being permitted to print the following
lines from the letter of a California lady
of education and discrimination who has
It is difficult, almost impossible, for a
distant public to obtain from the theat
rical criticism of the New York papers a
just idea of what is really good, really
bad and really indifferent in the metro
politan theatrical world. Many papers
are controlled more or less by influences
of which the public knows nothing â influ
ences which often render the praise or
blame which these papers award abso
lutely worthless. Signed articles are still
tho exception rather than the rule. This
tends to weaken a responsibility already
weak and to lessen the value of judg
ments seldom, judicial. Critics there be,
of course, whose veracity and capacity
are above suspicion; such are Norman
Hapgocd of the Bookman and William
Winter of the Tribune, i But the former
writes only once a month and the latter
not even so often.
For several reasons. First," fashionâ a
topic that has been so well threshed out
that it need not be beaten over again
here. Second, because people of refine
ment, who really love music, are kept
away from such a house as the Tivoli by
the atmosphere of tobacco and beer that
makes it impossible for them to enjoy the
excellent s^ork being done on the stage.
The management has posted a notice re
questing gentlemen not to smoke during
the grand opera season, but it has not
courage enough to enforce Its own re
quest. The night I saw "The Barber of
Seville" there was smoking in every part
of the house. "We may be sure Mr. 1 Grau
will permit nothing of this kind.
A third reason why Mr. Grau will get
fourteen times as much as Mrs. Kreling
for a performance not even twice as good
is that he will give his operas in a thea-'
ter and not in a barn. People do really
know the difference. â¢ â¢ * Nothing im
presses a stranger to San Francisco more
unfavorably than the hideous appearance
and inconvenient arrangement of our two
most popular places of amusementâ a hld
eousness and an inconvenience at once de
plorable and unnecessary. If we had in
3an Francisco a man of Mr. Keith's cour
age, taste and ability the Tivoli and the
Orphcum would disappear in one month
and would be rebuilt in five. They would
then attract a ciass of people who now
never think of entering these buildings
except when they have to, and then only
with shuddering and with fear.
The weakness of the Tivoli organization
has been chiefly in its sopranos, and now
that the erratic Azzalls have been gath
ered Into the fold we may hope for better
things In that direction. The staging Is
tolerable; the chorus, led by that gentle
giant Napoleoni. is sufficient if not im
pressive; the orchestra, though too per
sistently loud, might be a great deal worso
without being unendurable, and the price
of the whole entertainment is just one
fourteenth of what Mr. Grau la going to
chargeâ and will get. "Why will he get It?
PRICES for the grand opera season
are to' be $7 for the beat seats. In
strict logic, then, Messrs. Grau and
Bouvier should give us perform
ances fourteen ! times as good as
those now being given at the Tlvoli. That
is impossible, for in spite* of patent defects
the average of singing and acting at the
ugly little theater on Eddy street Is high;
so far as the men are concerned, Indeed,
it is higher than that attained by the men
in that company of Mr. Grau's which vis
ited us two years aÂ»o. Pandolflni was the
only real actor In that company, and he
was no better than Ferrari, whom I saw
the other night In an excellent Interpreta
tion of Figaro, nor than Nicollni, whose
Don Basilio was equally good.

maddening. But the law prevents any interference

mands ha? boen the custom for years
owing to the fact that tax collections do
rot commence to accumulate until the end
of October, but he says It is a violation
of the charter nevertheless, which among
the duties prescribed for the Treasurer
provides that "he chaJl keep the accounts
btlcng1r.gr to each fund separate and dis
tinct and fhall in no case pay demands
chargeable against one fund out of
moneys belonging to another."
McCarthy was further informed that
tnis method was countenanced by Mayor
Phelan, Treasurer Brooks, Auditor Wells
end Supervisors Jennings. Tobin and Ho
taling of the Finance Committee. At a
conference held laÂ«=t July It was decided
to pay thÂ« demands for Julv. Au^rust. Sep
tember and October out of St. Mary's
Park fund, the sinking fund and all other
McCarthy was bo dumfounded when he
heard the statement of these facts that
he immediately expressed his determina
tion to direct the attention of the Board
of Supervisors to the plain violation of
the charter. He Fays It would be an In
justice to compel the city's creditors to
wait until sufficient moneys had been col
lected in taxes, but contends that there
Is no warrant in law to pay one dollar out
of the sinking fund or St. Mary's Park
fund for demands on the general fund and
then to treat the demands as" cash.
McCarthy states that the figures carried
on the Treasurer's hooks as cash r.-ill be
increased to over $500,000 when demands
for October are settled at the end of this
month. In other words, that amount of
money Is supposed to be in the city treas
ury in coin, but all there Is to show for
It Is a mass of demands which have been
paid illegally.
funds except the general, which Is ex
hausted. As a consequence St. Mary's
Park fund, amounting to $125,000, has been
used to pay the demands of this fiscal
year. The fund has been expended not
withstanding that It must remain Intact
until the final decision of the Supreme
Court that it may or may not be used for
other purposes is* handed down.

J. C. Sims, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, and Mayor Phe
lan are on a "junketing tour in Southern
California. M. F. Tarpey of the National
Committee is at the California Hotel, de
vising plans to raise more money to sus
tain Bryanism. Mr. Tarpey has resorted
to the "endless chain" system of soliciting
contributions. In an address to the "Sons
and Daughter.3 of Liberty" Mr. Tarpey
ventures the announcement that "The
Declaration of Independence is rudely de
nied by the pr.-sent Republican adminis
tration." After setting forth that the
National Democratic Committee is sorely
In need of funds, Mr. Tarpey commends
the "endless chain" method of solicita
tion.
In a plaintive appeal to California he
cries:
"It seems. fitting that this effort to sup
port our great cause through an appeal
to patriotic men and women of moderate
means should be attempted In this State,
where 'the plain people' are protesting
against taxation without representation
and against the tyranny of a foreign
potentate. If it succeeds the plan will be
tried everywhere."
The picture of the "foreign potentate"
produced by the imagination of the so
licitor Is not clearly drawn. Henry T.
Gage Is Governor of the State, but he is
not a "foreign potentate." Neither Is he
addicted to royal notions of etiquette, as
he wore boots at his Inaugural ball. The
Lieutenant Governor of California cannot
be placed in the galaxy of "foreign
potentates." He Is not tyrannical; he is
not a foreigner and he Is not a potentate.
He Is an honest miner, and a good one.
Possibly Mr. Tarpey has Mayor Phelan in
mind and perhaps his allusion Is Intended
for Assessor Dodge.
Further along In the circular the Na
tional Commltteeman pays:
"Persons who are wiling to start such a
chain will secure circulars upon applica
tion. "
"As persons solicited more than once
are not expected to contribute a second
time, such are requested to send circulars
received after the first solicitation to per
eons net already solicited.
"Do not retain any of these circulars,
as one will be returned to you with the
receipt for your contribution.
"Money can be safely inclosed In an
ordinary envelope."
The Call must decline to obey the In
junction of the National Commltteeman
regarding the retention of the circular.
The one in possession of this Journal Is
too highly prized to part with. The ad
mission that money can be safely Inclosed
in an ordinary envelope Is certainly a
tribute to the rectitude of one important
branch of the public service under Re
publican administration. Can it be that
the "foreign potentate" has given the
postal service the overlook?

An announcement made yesterday by
Chairman Mark that ;he Board of Edu
cation Intended to place evening and day
teachers on an equality in making as
signments to regular positions according
to the chronological order of their ap
pointment will be cheering news to those
educators who ply their vocation In the
night time. At the last meeting of the
board Superintendent Webster directed
attention to the fact that a resolution was
passed by the last board providing: that
in fixing the average date of original ap
pointment of teachers experience in night
schools should count for one-half as com
pared with similar experience In day
schools. Webster notified the board that
unless the resolution were regularly re
scinded it is in full force and effect and
the assignment of teachers to the day
substitute and day unasslgned lists was
subject to its provisions.- . / â¢â¢;
Webster further stated that' the board
had illegally assigned Miss Lucille O'Con
nell and Miss M. F. Mooney to the substi
tute list, as the fact '.hat they had been
elected as evening school teachers would
bring down their average date of ap
pointment several months later on ac
count t of evening experience counting
only one-half. In that event the two
teachers would be relegated to the,bot
tom of the day unasslgned list.
Chairman Mark has directed the secre
tary of the board. to ascertain the date of
the passage of the resoiution referred to
by Webger. The rescinding of the reso
lution will folloxv and the substitute list
will be left undisturbed.
"The board believes." said Mark, "that
the chronological order can be best fol
lowed by taking the exact date of tho
teachers' election into consideration when
assignments are made. We take the stand
that this Is the only fair way to follow
out the priority of service rule.: If a res
olution has been passed placing night ex
perience in teaching as only one-half as
effective as that of day teaching It will
certainly be abrogated. I and the other
Directors believe night experience in
teaching to be equally as valuable as day
experience and 'In some Instances more
so. Let the original date of appointment
obtain in assignments of teachers and it
strikes me that it will be just to all
teachers.". .. - â¢
Director Dcnman Is hopeful that by the
end of the school term places will be
found for many of the present substi
tutes. What with leaves of absenco
granted to other pedagogues, retirements
and. marriages the outlook for teachers
now unasslgned is very promising.
A circular has been issued by the cam
pajgn committee to principals and teach
ers urging active work for the purpose of
bringing about the passage of Senate con
stitutional amendment 15 to be presented
to the people on November 6. 1900. Prin
cipals are requested to obtain from their
teachers a statement as to the amount
each will contribute to a campaign fund.

Cf course it is the province of
sense to take advantaje of business
progress Pattosien's big store on
16th and A.ission Streets is crowded
every day with buyers of bargains
Yes, sensible thrifty home providers
who will not wait until the excitement
of the holiday season has clouded
their judgment are taking advan-
tage of the low prices now prevailing
in every department and furnishing
their homes with lasting Furniture
and Carpets and warm Bedding and
Draperies at a saving of 25 per cent
compared with holiday prices. He
who reads rules .
Does it not stand to reason in any
reasonable mind that the place to
get your money's worth is where
honesty abides; where goodness
and style and low prices are com-
mingled all the while in what you de-
sire? Such a store is Pattosien's,
It is the height of folly for any
one in any line of business to pay
two prices, and you know by coming
out to the Mission you avoid the
stores where you are asked to pay
two prices- one for the privilege of
getting in and the other for the
pleasure of getting outâ alive.
Pattosien's store is an original
store in the fullest sense of the word.
Yes, it must appear even to the
thoughtless as soon as they enter
the big building that the whole great
enterprise is cast in a different
mold, so, to speak â it is cast in
large molds -an expansive and gen-
erous mold of thought, while the
combine stores cast in aj con-
tracted "ingrown-nail" kind of mold.
A RARE COMMODITY.
ORIGINALITY IS
Pattosien's big store stands as a
barrier against everything that can-
not show a clean bill of health for
common honesty; it is supported
and sustained by three powerful
agenciesâ one is its superior quality
and character of the Furniture and
Carpets, the other is the proper
appreciation of the people, and the
third is the fact that the price for
the same goods is always about 20
per cent lower than the prices of
the combine.
A fox's reputation rests In his
skin. ;â¢ i
When you come to look at it or
when you come to look at the two-
price combine you see In it noth-
ing but the face of the fox. It may
not be as handsome as that little
t.ack tip of nose, decked with red
or sorrel, but it is that inquisitive
nose that is projecting itself into
the business methods of the pres-
ent. It is the fox of usury, the
advance agent of trusts and com-
bines. They want to make it all in
one year, by trying to get the ex-
clusive sale of certain lines of goods
and charging two prices.
Bear these truths in mind. Pat-
tosien's big store, represents the
mighty truth of business! Its con-
tents represent the truth of values!
Its principle represents the truth of
integrity! Its prices represent the
truth of bargains. Everything in-
tcrna'.iy or externally typifies
precise truth.
AND WILL PREVAIL.
TRUTH !S MIGHTY
extended in the interest of the people
it is right here and now. Trusts
and combines are sapping the life
blood of individual effort and are
bearing from the embrace of humble
enterprise the fruit of untiring
activity.
The Pattosien Company has for
several years been subjected to the
most foul and un-American methods
of so called competitors because
it would not join the combine in "a
contemptible conspiracy against"
the right of man. But the big store
in the Mission stood its ground and
K:pt down the prices of house furn-
ishings to the proper level of home
comfort
The Pattosien Company, corner
16th and Mission Streets, runs the
biggest Furniture and Carpet House
on the Pacific Coastâ for all the
people. They hnve a corps of honor-
able and intelligent salesmen but
vho are ignorant of all the ''tricks
of the trade." ignorant of those pe-
culiar methods which those peculiar
creatures of the combine adopt to
gain trade and grow rich, ignorant
of everything that smacks ot "smart
practice." They have a manager in
charge who is a Power unto himself,
without a letter of credit from any
trust or combine, gifted by nature
with a well balanced head and with
an everlasting desire to do right by
his bellow men.
Any attempt of any of the combine
stores to imitate the business
methods or to follow in the footsteps
of Pettosien's.would be likeacripplc
on crutches. In a swamp trying to
follow an express train.

FOR BRYAN DEFEAT IS INEVITABLE.
New York County cast 308,232 votes for
President In 1S96. It will probably cast
360 000 votes this year. In so large a total
vote a slight change In either direction
would make a marked difference In tho
plurality. The estimate here given is
based upon the conditions now existing.
The vote In Kings County Is estimated
as follows: McKlnley's plurality, 5000;
Odell's plurality, 1000.
Careful figuring gives Brooklyn to Mc-
Klnlev this year by a majority very much
less than that by which he carried it four
years ago. In 1896 the county gave Mc-
Kinley a plurality of 32.253. This year,
according to Indications, bis plurality will
be between 5000 and 10,000. Odell will have
John B. Stanchfield will probably run
at least 5000 votes ahead of Benjamin B.
Odell Jr., the Republican candidate for
Governor in New York County. The sound

Stanchfield rather than Mr. Odell, though

Montana Is regarded as safely Demo

Montana gave Bryan 42,537. votes ; in 1896

Careful analysis of the claims of the

sentiment favoring McKinley .it is be

McKinley Electors Will Be Chosen by

Industrial conditions In West , Virginia
are excellent. There conditions are di
rectly in favor-t>f the Republican national
ticket, as the vote of the coal districts Is
naturally Republican and the miners
openly express their fears of the possible
results of a change of national politics.
Imperialism and trusts. are the issues
discussed. The first named does not
arouse ' much enthusiasm. The sound
seems to interest many, though there Is
no apparently widespread belief that the
Democrats are Â¦ any more In earnest in
regard to the annihilation of trusts than
are the. Republicans. Free silver is not
talked of this year at all, which Is In
eharp contrast .with the campaign of 1896
In this State, when the - farmers were
widely excited over the money measure
and ardent advocates of free coinage.
West Virginia's density of population Is
determined by the operation of railroads,
coal mines and industrial concerns, and
wherever a McKinley majority appears,
especially where previous elections show
Democratic pluralities, It will be found
they arise from an Increased vote of rail
road men, mlneworkers or millmcn. In
1896 the railroad managers, coal operators
and mill managers were openly working
for the interests of the Republican candi
date for President. .This year, while
nearly all of them favor the election of
the Republican ticket.- they have â¢ not as
yet shown any great energy In increasing:
the vote in this State for the Republican
Electors.
The influences at work to reduce the Re
publican plurality this year are so strong
and so difficult to estimate that the
Democrats, are hopeful it may be Â¦wiped
out altogether and \Vest Virginia go
Democratic. Owing to a Democratic
gerrymander of the State a Republican
plurality for the national ticket of less
than 5000 may result in a Democratic
Legislature and the election of a Demo
crat to succeed United ; States Senator
Stephen B. Elkins. If the Legislature is
Democratic and the gubernatorial election
very close, as Js probable, many fear a.
desperate contest for the executive chair,
such as West Virginia has already wit
nessed once before in its history.
There can be no doubt that the fate of
the Republican ticket this year rests upon
the vote , in ten industrial counties
which turned Republican in 1896. Marked
Indifference to the election, lack of inter
est on the part of the managers of big in
dustrial enterprises or any considerable
increase of Democratic belief among the
people of these ten counties, would make
the State Democratic.
Neither party has a good organization
In the State, though the Republicans are
better off in this respect than the Demo
crats. The Republican official estimate
of the plurality is 21,000. The Democrats
claim that a careful poll shows a plurality
for Bryan of 7500.
West Virginia must not be called a
doubtful State, though the six electoral
votes will probably be given to President
McKinley at this election by a much
smaller plurality than In 1S96.

Mormons can swing Utah to McKinley

This Bryan loss is absolute. Another loss
to Bryan is among the cattlemen. The

The cattlemen in Western Nebraska are
emphatically for McKinley. Buffalo

trict, of Â¦which Kearney is the county

the-road Populist revolt against fusion.
There are no less than 200 Populists in
Buffalo County who have left the fusion

licans. They are really former Repub
licans who joined the Populist movement
in 1S95. determined to fight both the old

Congressional districts throughout che
country shows that the House of Repre

will be safely Republican unless there Is a
landslide to Bryan. The Republicans
stand to carry on the face of reports re

a majority and is the representation the
party has now. There are fourteen dis

William Rodenbergr, his opponent being
Fred J. Kern. All these districts are now
represented by Republicans and any one
carried by tho Democrats represents a
Republican loss:
In Kansas the doubtful district is tho
Fifth, now represented by James M. Mil
ler, a Republican.
The doubtful district in Maryland is the
Second, represented by William B. Baker.
The Democratic candidate is J. Fred-C.
Talbot. former Representative. The
chances seem to favor Talbot's election.
In Minnesota the districts in doubt are
the Sixth and Seventh. These are both
represented by Republicans at this time.
â¢ The doubtful Missouri districts are the
Eleventh and Twelfth," now represented
by Richard Barthold and Charles F. Joy.
Montana is considered a doubtful State,
but the Republicans during the last few
days have shown a disinclination to
claim It.
The two doubtful districts In Ohio are
the Third, which Is now represented by
John L. Brenner (Dem.), and the Twen
tieth, whose representative now is F. O.
Phillips.
; The one doubtful district in Virginia is
In the Doubtful Districts.
The doubtful districts are one in Vir

In Maryland. - *â¢
Of the 117 solid South 'representatives
ninety-eight will be Democrats and four

to be fought- out in five doubtful districts.

The South, as. usual, is almost solid for
the Democratic candidate. Tha States of
Alabama, Arkansas. ,â¢ Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Caro
lina and Texas Â¦ will be represented by
Democrats entirely.;
From Kentucky there are likely to be

from West Virginia three, from Mary

There was a large registration In 1S96
and the McKinley landslide followed it

of the repetition of their victory. They

the old school. Many of these Democrats

nor Democratic campaign managers have
yet given out figures. The Republicans
however, publicly claim tho county bv a.
maiority approximating that which wa3
rolled up In 1S96. while the Democrats pre
dict something like the Van Wvck maior
lty of 1S9S for their candidate. Van Wyclc
received 1S.2S2 more- votes in Kings than
result In Pennsylvania having a vacant
seat in the Senate. Quay Is not out of
the woods by any means and the result Is
very, much in doubt. Two seats are In
doubt in the States of Delaware, Montana
and Nebraska.
In Delaware there Is a vacancy, and
Senator Kenny's term expires. There Is
a fierce fight in the Republican party ow
Addicks and while there is one set of
Republican Legislative candidates in
Newcastle County, there are two seta of
Republican candidates In the other two
counties. Unless one of these tickets is
withdrawn the Democrats are likely to
control the Legislature.
The Fight in Montana.
In Montana, where Senator Clark's seat
is vacant and Senator Carter's term ex
pires, there, is~a very fierce contest be
tween the Clark and Daly factions. No
one can tell'untll after the election wheth
er the Republicans will control the Leg
islature or not, probably not.
The Republicans of Nebraska claim to
have some chance of winning the Legis
lature even if Bryan . carries the State.
Should Bryan be defeated and the Legis
lature be carried by the f usionists, the
Senators elected would probably be Bryan
and Allen. The fusionists have recently
been making great efforts to carry the

at Abuot 44,000.
McKinley's Plurality Is Figured Out
McKlnley's plurality in New Jersey will
be about 44,000. This estimate is based on
information obtained from about a hun
dred different persons of whom inquiries
were made in every county In the State,
Including political leaders, chairmen and
secretaries of State and county political
organizations of both great parties, min
isters of the Gospel of many denomina
tions, newspaper men, manufacturers,
working men and business men.
The Republicans are full of boundless
confidence, and the tide is all their "way.
Their factional fights in a few counties
over local offices have abated, and will
apparently have llttlo effect. They have
plenty of money. The Democrats feel the
depression incident. to waging a hopeless
fight, and their State leadership fails to
Inspire confidence. Few Democrats who
refused to vote for Bryan four years ago
will vote for him this time. Some Demo
crats who voted for McKinley four years
ago- -will stay away from' the polls this
year altogether. Many of the Democrats
who voted for Palmer and Buckner in
1896, numbering 6373 In this State, will vote
for McKinley this time. Some will not
vote at all and a few of them will vote
for Bryan. It can be safely affirmed that
the canteen question cuts no flugre In the
canvass. It is not talked about or consid
ered. It is not an issue. Nor are impe
rialism and militarism Important factors
In the campaign. Many persons were op
posed to the acquisition of the Philippines,
but comparatively few feel disposed to
carry this opposition to the extent of giv
ing up and lying down. Nor do they be
lieve that a Bryan administration could
bring about a more patriotic and satisfac
tory solution of the problem than can the
present administration. There is much
the same feeling as to trusts. The people
do not believe that this is a , party ques
tion.- The main question considered and
taken seriously by the voters of New Jer
sey Is' the danger in Mr. Bryan's election
of an overturning of the present business
and industrial prosperity and of bringing
commercial and financial disaster upon
the country. The dread of this is at the
bottom of the distrust -of and opposition
to Bryanism. There is a deep and wide
spread feeling among the Democrats of
this State, that there can be no hope for
the party until it is rid of Bryanism once
and for all, and many of them have re
solved to help bury it out of sight this
year/ . Â¦

Estimates Made by Croker Will Be
Very Much. Reduce d.
New York Countyâ Bryan' a plurality,
30,000; Stanchfleld's plurality, 35,000. '
Richard Croker has :; declared that
Greater New York Trill give Bryan a plu
rality of 100,000, and he has assured Mr.
Bryan himself that he will have 80,000
more votes \ than McKinley In the city.
The Democrats expect this plurality. to be
rolled up in the boroughs of Manhattan
and Bronx. In. view of the large majority
which they expect from the interior of the
State the Republican campaign managers
are disposed to be liberal to the city Dem
ocrats. Â¦ Â¦ Their Â¦ estimate of the Tammany
plurality of New York County is between
40,000 and 50,000. It Is probable that both
the Democrats and Republicans have set
their figures too high. Collating the
results from registration with - all the
other facts bearing upon the drift of sen
timent? and giving Tammany the benefit
of every, doubt,' it does not seem probable
that its plurality for Bryan in the county
of New York will exceed 30,000.

Btuart'fl Dyspepsia Tablets are a discov-

disordered digestion.
Almost everybody's digestion .is dis-

thing they do for it Is to take some one
of the many so-called blood purifiers,
which In many cases are merely strong
cathartics. . Such things are not needed.
If-the organs are In a clogged condition,
they need only a little help and they will
right themselves. Cathartics Irritate the
sensitive linings of .. tho stomach and
bowels and often do more harm than
good. Â¦ *. . .
Purging Is not what . Is needed. The
thing to do is to put *.the --food' In con-
dition to be readily digested and assimi-
lated. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do
this perfectly. They partly digest what
is eaten and give the stomach just the
help It needs. They stimulate the secre-
tion and excretion of the digestive fluids
and relieve the congested condition of the
glands and membrane*. They put the
Â¦whole digestive system In condition to do
its work. When that Is done you need
take no more tabletB, unless you eat what
does not agree with you. Then take one
or two tabletsâ give them needed help and
you will have no trouble.

that which will cross the lake, will be
about 319 miles. TMs is thirty mile*

Ernest Coleman of the hospital corps
left his post In the general hospital at the
Presidio several days ago and on the ros
ter of the hospital "Absent without leave"
is written opposite his name. Coleman
took his departure shortly after receiving
a letter from Kansas City, and before go
ing confided to a friend the reason for his
departure without asking leave.
Two years ago, when Coleman enlisted
at Kansas City, he left behind him a
sweetheart, promising to return at the
end of his enlistment and make her his
wife. She was willing to waÂ» that length
of time, giving in return her promise to
remain faithful. They corresponded reg
ularly, and Coleman was anxiously count
ing the days that must elapse ere he could
go home and claim his bride. About two
months ago the letters from the girl
seemed to lack in fervor, and the hospital
steward became anxious. There was ev
ery reason for his anxiety, for each suc
cessive epistle from his lady love con
tained fewer expressions of love and the
"thousands of kisses" dwindled to but
one. The climax came in a short note
which read:
Dear Ernest: I'm etuck on another fellow.

told his tale of woe to a friendly comrade,
saying: Â»
"I can get another girl, but I am going
back to break the head of the fellow that

For several years Liucaiyptol, Guaiacoi
and Hydrastin have been recognized as
standard remedies for catarrhal troubles,
but they have always been given separate-
ly and only very recently an Ingenious
chemist succeeded in combining them, to-
ge'her with other antiseptics, Into a pleas-
ant, effective tablet.
Druggists sell the remedy under the
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and it
has met with remarkable success in the
cure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and
throat catarrh and in catarrh of the
Mr F.N.Benton,. whose address is care
of Clark House, Troy, N. V., says: When
I run up against anything that is good I
like to tell people of it. I have been
troubled with catarrh more or less for
some time. Last winter more than ever.
Tried several so-called cures, but did not
-get any benefit from them. "About six
.weeks ago I bought a 50-cent box- of
Stuart* Catarrh Tablets and I am glad
to cay that they have done wonders for
me and I do 'not hesitate to let all my
friends know that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets are the right thing. _
Mr. Geo. J. Casanova of Hotel Griffon,
West Ninth street, : New York City,
writes: I have commenced using Stuarre

the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in

"To find that a lack of knowledge of
how to properiy feed one's self caused
me to serve ten long years as a miser-
able dyspeptic is rather humiliating. I
was a sufferer for that length of time and
had become a shadow of my natural self.
I was taking medicine all the time and
dieting the best I knew how.
"One day I heard of Grape-Nuts
food, in which the starch was predigest-
ed by natural processes and that the
foodrebuiit the brain and nerve centers.
I knew that if my nervous system could
be made strong and perfect I could di-
pest food all right, so I started in on
Grape-Nuts, with very little confidence.
for I had been disheartened for a long
time. 'â¢ r; :
"To my surprise and delight I found I
was improving after living on Grape-
Nuts a little while, and in three months
I had gained 12 pounds and was feeling
like a new person. For the past two
years I have not had the slightest symp-
tom of indigestion, and am now perfect-
ly well.
"I made a discovery that will be of im-
portance to many mothers. When ray
infant was two months old I began to
give it softened Grape-Nuts. Baby was
being fed on the bottle and not dointr
well, but after starting on Grape-Nuts
food and the water poured over^ it the
child began to improve rapidly, is now
a year old and very fat and healthy, and
has never been sick. Is unusually
bright â has been saying words ever
<;ince it was six months old. I know

in Grape-Nuts that brightens up any
one. infant or adult, both physically and
mentally." - ~ --. .

BCTTE, Mont.. Oct. 20.â On a sidetrack
Jn a wind-swept corner of the Northern
Pacific Railway yards in South Butte
6Tj\nds the private car Cleopatra, in which
Ere housed thirty San Francisco tots'rang
ing in years from 3 to 13, who comprise
the S. H. Friedlander "Brownie" troupe.
FRIEDLANDER'S "BROWNIES"
QUARANTINED AT BUTTE
which left San Francisco on September 1
for a Northwestern and Eastern tour, to
end at New York.
The sides of the car are plastered with
quarantine labels and a big- policeman
stands guard at the door. Five of the
youthful thespianf? are lying ill with scar
let fever, and the entire troupe is under
surveillance by the Butte health depart
ment.
Manager Friedlander has been in* a peck
of trouble ever since he entered the bor
ders of the copper State. His dates at the
Grand Opera-house here conflicted with
those of another company and he was
obliged to lease the house and employ de
vious legal methods in order to give his
performance. When the engagement end
ed on the 12th inst. Friedlander stayed in
town, and now the cause is manifest. At
noon yesterday the Northern Pacific phy
sician reported to the city health officer
of Butte that the "Brownies" had scarlet
fever. An investigation caused that offi
cial to quarantine the car. Friedlander
tried to escape and get uptown last even
ing, but the officer collared him and re
turned him to the car, where he is now
in close quarantine with his Juvenile 6tars.
"The whole trouble is due to the unsani
tary condition of our private car," said
Manager Friedlander. "When the car was
turned over to us the drainage tubes
would not flush and the odor was such
that the constant use of disinfectants was
necessary. Complaint was made to the
railway officials, but to no purpose, and
we were obliged to borrow water and
carry It in cans to the car at every sta
tion. At Walla Walla Arthur Parout was
first taken ill with typhoid pneumonia,
which the physicians state was due to the
car being tilled with microbes. Still noth
ing waa done by the company, and when
we reached Butte the car was scarcely fit
for occupation, despite our efforts to
cleanse it. During our engagement here
Gladys Sorenson, aged 7; Louise Conkey,
aged 8; Alice Condon, aged 12; Rose Con
don, aged 13; Florence Emery, aged 7:
Arthur Parout, aged 9; Eva Lerner, aged
5, and Sibyl Sorenson, aged 3. developed
scarlet fever, and or. the matter being re
ported to the city authorities by the rail
way officials we were tied up on this side
track, and here we are likely to stay for
two v.-eeks. Our dates have been canceled
and our futre movements are uncertain.
Three of the childrenâ Florence Emery
and the Condon girlsâ are convalescent
and the others are doing well. The moth
ers of the little ones are with them and
trained nurses are on board the car. â¢ Lit
tle Gladys Weller, the cornetist, has de
veloped a case of the mumps, and one of
our colored porters has come down with
intermittent fever. If none of the other
children are infected we shall deem our
selves lucky. I think we have an excel
lent case against the Pullman Company
fop damages, as our contract calls for a
first class private car. and the one fur
nished is scarcely fit for habitation. We
will continue our tour as soon as we are
released from quarantine if the health of
the children permits."

children with the troupe are Maude Soren

DECLARES HIS
VOTE WILL GO
TO MCKINLEY
Archbishop Ireland Ends All
Doubt as to His Atti-
publican Ticket He Will Serve
the Best . Interests of
the Country.
Satisfied That By Supporting the Re-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Archbishop Ire
land to-day gave, out the following per
sonal statement as to his attitude in the
present campaign:
How do I Intend to vote? It cannot at first
Bifiht but seem more or less impertinent for
nny citizen to tell the public how he intends
to vote. In voting each citizen obeys the dic
tates of his own sense of civic duty; he, should
simply do this, and leave to others to do like
wise.
However, since a certain number of news
papers have undertaken to say how I intend
to vote, and in so doing have misinterpreted
my Intention and have not been unwilling to
n:&ke political capital of my supposed vote, I
will plve to the question how 1 Intend to vote
a categorical and unmistakable reply. I in
tend to vote for William McKinley.
I Intend to vote for William McKlnley and
Theodore Roosevelt. In giving my vote for the
candidates of the Republican party I am sat
ifcfled In my own conscience that I serve the
Lr>st interests of the country at home and
ntroad: that I contribute to the maintenance
of the country's mat-rial prosperity and of
pr nee and good will between the several classes
of its population; that I aid the country In
bringing about the safest and most honorable
solutions of the complex problems which con
fiont it as the result of the late war and in
retaining for Itself the exalted position which
It holds at present commercially and diplo
matically before other nations of the world.

HANNA LEAVES NEBRASKA.
Narrowly Escapes Serious Injury
Through Collapse of a Stand.
OMAHA, Nebr., Oct. 20.â Senator Hanna
concluded his six days' tour- of speaking
at Omaha to-night, winding up his itin
erary by making four speeches, thrc-e in
South Omaha, where are located the big
packing interests of the city and where
his audiences were for the most part
composed of laboring men. and one In
Omaha. Late to-night the special train
left over the : Burlington - road for Chi
cago and will arrive there to-morrow
morning. Senator Hanna- will devote but
little time to .the business of the national
headquarters next week, however, as he
is booked for speeches nearly every day
next" week, mostly in Illinois towns. The
week's itinerary has included over 2300
miles of travel in the' three States, Sena
tor Hanna in that time making nearly a
hundred ' speeches of from two to forty
minutes' duration. With the exception of
some hoarseness he has withstood the ar
duous week's campaigning exceedingly
well.
Senator Hanna- narrowly escaped seri
ous injury to-day at Auburn, where a
stand had been erected on the. race track
of the fair grounds. The overcrowding 1
of the frail structure 'and the" crush., of
people around it caused, the stand to col
lapse with a crash that almost created a
panic in the grounds. Although thrown
on his back by the fall of six feet, Sena
tor Hanna was entirely unhurt. A boy
clinging to the structure had his leg
broken by being "caught under the tim
bers, i : . ,â¢ ........' Â« ....
Besides the four speeches" at Omaha to
night Senator Hanna made addresses at
nine towns in the territory covered dur
ing the day, which included the extreme
southeastern portion of the State.

ELECTRICIAN AT SALINAS
"SEKIOTJSLY UTJUHED
: SALINAS, Oct. 20-t-C. R. Norton, chief
electrician ; at the Spreckels Sugar Com
pany's factory near this city, was found
in an unconscious condition this after
noon neaT one of the large electric motors,
with a gaping hole in his head.
When Norton was discovered by two
v/orkmen he was senseless and up to a
late hour to-night has not regained con
sciousness. His recovery I is reported as
impossible.
It is supposed that Norton was acci
dentally injured, but rumors are current
that since the death of his wife he has
been morose and that he attempted to end
his life.
The supposition is that while Norton
was on a tour of Inspection through his
department the reverse lever of a large
motor flew back and struck him on the
head, fracturing his skull.
Norton's wife died; in the East recently
and the news: of her demise was a great
shock to him. He has been In the employ
of the Spreckels Company a long time.

And then the old man went to sleep. He
determined to die in the morning. He
arose early yesterday, contrary to his
custom, and before day had dawned left
his home and went to his office In the
building of the Young Men's Christian
Association at Ellis and Mason streets
He; locked the outer door and went into
his inner and private office.
At 7:30 o'clock the ofllce boy, Leo
Barker, arrived at the offlce, opened the
door and prepared for the business of the
day. He went to the door of Ewing's
private offlce. looked In and found the old
man sitting in his chairâ dead. The sui
cide had attached one end of a rubber
tube to the chandelier and after winding
part of it around his neck, so that when
unconsciousness overcame him it would
not be disturbed, had placed the other end
Into his mouth.
When the offlce boy raised the alarm
and sought* assistance, the old man was
dead. The physicians who came could do
nothing; the minister could give no other
tribute than tears. George H. Thomas
Post will honor the last wish of- its old
comrade and bury him with Its services
and think perhaps what the old man
wrote a few months ago:
At times we rise above' the tide;
Our vision reaches far and wide.
And not a sail Is spread to view
That does not seem for me or you.
A night may come and Intervene
Between us and th' enchanted scene;
The ships are turned toward the sea
And Hope has changed Despair to be.
He returned to his home Friday night
and wrote a farewell note, pathetic, hope
less and still pleading: even In its despair,
to his niece. He had determined to kill
Manager Thompson very quickly dis
covered gross irregularities in the books
and proofs of dishonesty In the accounts.
He at once demanded the old man's res
ignation. And the old man save it and
then went home to write a note asking
Manager Thompson to bury his dead body
decently. The resignation was sent to thn
head office of the company in Philadel
phia and on Friday Ewlnc received its
acceptance. It meant death to him.
As superintendent of the Welsbach
Company on the Pacific Coast he had
complete control of considerable money.
He took part of this money and falsified
the books in a vain effort to ;hlde his
crime. Ten days ago he saw that the end
had come. Robert J. Thompson, acting
manager of ' the Welsbach Company, ar
rived from Philadelphia and Instructed
the old man to prepare for an examina
tion of his books and accounts. Ewing
saw that detection was inevitable. He had
no money with which to ray back what
he had stolen. It was absolutely impos
sible for him to deceive his superior and
in his old age he could not endure the
dishonor that was to come upon him.
In his condition, weak mentally and
physically, his troubles at home and in
business took exaggerated forms. His
wife and daughter became ill and he was
forced to send them to their former home
in Ohio. His niece, Mrs. Daisy Chapman,
remained with him to care for his house
hold at 434 Ellis street. The unfortunate
man never, possessed much money and a
new competition in business reduced his
income. At the same time his necessities
increased and in his old age, after a
career which had won him respect and
honor, he was forced for the sake of his
family and himself. to become a thief.

and it was seen that he had symptoms of
softening of the brain.

The American ship Shenandoah also got
in last night after cruising Rbout outsido
the heads all day. rilie made an excep
tionally good run of seventy-four days
from Sydney. N.' ; S. W. . . ; â¢
"What the name of the ship was in which
Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" took pas
sage is not known, but if lie had cared to
repeat his experience he might have
bought a ticket on the American ship
Aryan, which, storm-beaten and weed
grown, dropped anchor off Goat Island
last night, six months out from New York.
The vessel has gone through as tough
an experience as ever falls to the lot of
her kind. In latitude 48' 40' south and.
longitude 79!' 10' west the Aryan poked her
nose into a hurricane that narrowly
missed whipping the sticks out of her,
and cost two of the seamen â John Larsen
and George Ruf, both of New Yorkâ their
lives.
As she lay off Goat Island last night
there was little about the trim craft to
indicate what she had gone through. Only
at tho peak the colors flew half-mast, and
a gloom lay on the crew. Liberal coats
of paint and plenty of elbow grease have
made the Aryan outwardly as trim as
when she left her home port, but forward
in the forecastle the men's talk of nights
is of hoodoos and the heavy hand of a
hoodoo holding the Aryan becalmed and
sweeping on* two of their comrades to/an
ocean grave. In the. after, house these
tales are of course ridiculed, but like
Banquo's irrepressible ghost they will not
down, and Captain Whlttier himself ad
mits that never had he seen the like of ill
luck which befell the Aryan. . .
On April 28 the Aryan cleared from New
York for San Francisco. Her cargo was
of mixed hardwareâ a layer, of iron rails,
a layer of barreled horseshoes and so on
until she rode, with little freeboard to
spire It was Captain Whitlier's second
voyage in the.shipÂ»: She. had proved her
self a good; manageable craf t. But one
drawback to the prospect of successful
and speedy termination of the voyage pre
sented itself. Out of the crew of fifteen
men but six had ever been to sea.
â¢ -DespiteV- this disadvantage, however,
good time was made till the equator had
been 'crossed. Then the Aryan s troubles
commenced. -Day. after s day Captain
Whlttier's . command,, lay "Idle as a
painted ship upon a painted ocean," till
her seams opened .in the sun. and the
crew lay about the deck too weary of
waiting to even Â¦ whistle for the longed
for wind. Those days were but the
beginning of a long succession of calm*.
Once in a while a breeze would spring up
and.send the Aryan staggering along with
every stitch of canvas spread to catch it:
then down again would settle the deadly
calm to blister the paint and make tho
tar boil in the cracks between the deck
planks.
All thinjrshave an. end, however â even
calmsâ and about the middle of July tho
sun-dried Aryan rolled into real Cape
Horn weather. It took the crew sixteen
days to work her round into the Pacific,
with a great loss of canvas and expendi
ture of oil. Once fairly around, however,
and the Aryan's luck seemed to have
changed.
The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, "Â¦
The furrow followed free. : , â¢..-.;"â¢.
It seemed that aftÂ»r. all the Aryan
would manage to get to San. Francisco be
fore September, but on the night of Au
gust 10 the hopes of her captain and crew
were rudely dispelled.
During the day tho. wind, which had
blown so fairly, increased till it assumed
tho proportions of a i;a!e. Severe storma
are rare in the region ai which the Ary
an now was and her master did not an
ticipate the hurricane that -was brewing.
At about 9 o'clock that night it broke in
all its fury and, double reefed and under
short canvas as, she was the ship keeled
over on her beam ends, just when or
how John Larsen was 'ost none on board
knows, but as the last seen of him was
shortly before this furious squall he must
have been swept overboard by one of .the
huge combers which swept the decks.
One of the- quarter boats was whipped
clean out of the davits and carried to sea,
doors were smashed in. windows splin
tered, and to add to the general confusion
the pies and chickens broke out of the
long boat and ran. stricken with fright,
about the wave-washed 1 decks. They were
nearly all carried overboard. George
Ruf. the second man, to lose his life on
.that night, was lashing a boat more se
curely to the roof of tho afterhouse when
the squall came. A wave picked him up
and carried him clear ove^ to the rnlzzon
shrouds, against which he was. tlashol
with fearful force. Captain Whlttier him
self carried him below, where he died in
great agony a'few 'hours later. :Â¦â¢
Much canvas had â¢ to be sacrificed, but
the Aryan weathered the storm and con
tinued her voyage of .alternate stops and
starts until she crawled Into port last
night with only, the half-masted bit of
bunting and the gloom in the forecastle
to bear witness to what she had- seen on
the ocean highway.

ATTORNEY WHITTAKER
GRANTED SOTAIX LOAN
Accuses Frank Thomas of Sacramento
of Obtaining Money by False
Pretenses.
Attorney George E. Whittaker Â«rwore to
b. complaint In Judge Mogan's court yes
terday charging Frank Thomas with ob
taining money by false pretnses. Thomas,
the Attorney said, called upon him on
August 4. representing that he owned
property on Second street, between K and
L. Bacramento, and asked Whittaker to
negotiate a loan for him. Whittaker
agreed to do eo and Thomas "touched"
him for $20 on the plea that be urgently
needed It for slight repairs on one of his
houses. Whittaker, while trying to ne
gotiate tho loan, discovered that Thomas
did not own the property.
Thomas had a meteoric career in Sacra
mento, Whittaker says. September 27 he
was held there to answer before the Su
perior Court by Justice Anderson on a
charge of forgery preferred against him
by a Mrs. Fisher. He was released- on
bonds and is n<j*r in this city. Whittaker
alleges that Thomas "touched" a number
of people In Sacramento, one being Jus
ticÂ© Anderson, who gave up JIM.
Peter Harkins. a billposter and ex-door
keeper at the Alhambra Theater, has been

wife. They separated at the time of the
trouble and since then the wife, Delia
Harkins. has been living at 823C Sutter
street. He has been arrested two or three
times for falling to provide for his child.
Friday night Mrs. Harkins reported to
the police that a shot had been fired
through the window of the house ', where
fihe lives. Detective McMahon and Of
ficer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children were
detailed on the case and suspecting Har
kins, they arrested him at an early hour
yesterday morning. With the object of
detaining him, a charge of failure to
provide was brfoked against him. He was
taken before Judge Conlan yesterday
morning and as no complaint had been
sworn to against him he was discharged.
Harkins claims that he can prove satis
factorily that he could not have fired the
shot. The police are. still working on the
case and he may have the opportunity In
court of proving his alibi.

It Is said that Boscus lived with tho

his duplicity she swo*e to he revenged.
Knowing that Boscus feared that she

A REVOLVER
jm* ECRETARY OF STATE CURRY
flT notified Registrar Walsh yester-
day that an error had been made
\ mm^ \\\ the sample ballots sent by
htm to election officials through
out the State. If the error Is not cor
rected many citizens are liable to loso
their votes. The explanation of the error
is contained in Secretary Curry's letter,
which is as follows:
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 19. 1900.
Thomas J. "Walsh Esq., Registrar of Voters.
San Francisco, Cal.â Dear. Sir:. Some time since
we forwarded to you a sample ballot. We de
sire to call your attention to a correction that
should be made In said sample. At the right of
the words "For Electors" you will find a /otlng
pr*ce. This ' should be left out. and the Inner
line to each column should commence at the
lino below the words "For Electors," as I have
Indicated in the sample herewith Inclosed. Re
spectfully yours, . .
C. F. CURRY. Secretary of State.
By J..HOESCH, Deputy.
The danger 'lies in the fact that the
voter is liable to put a mark in the square
opposite "For Electors," and so on down
the list until he has voted ten times,
whereas he can vote for only nine Elect
ora. The mistake lies in the line having
been extended opposite "For Electors,
thus forming a square.
The Republican ticket as printed
on the sample ballot, all other tick
ets being similarly printed, is as
follows:
Registrar Walsh states that the ticket I
printed for this city does not contain the
error, but he fears that the sample ballot
may have been followed by election
officers in other cities. '

The winning team will meet the U. C.
freshmen on the Berkeley campua next
\Vednesday and will play a return game
with Lowell High School ln San Francisco
on November 3, the first meeting with,
this last named eleven having resulted In,
no score on either side.
Captain Pringle won fhe toss and chose
the northeast goal. Berkeley's right
guard kicked off to McNevin, who ran m
ten yards before being downed. Â¦ Reliance
made no attempt to pierce their oppo
nent's line in this Tialf, but relied on Ro
dolph's kicking to save them. Rodolph
kicked to the 40-yard line and then Berke
ley by short end runs and bucks by
Smith, Duden and Bralcy brought the ball
to the live-yard line, where they were
held on downs. Rodolph kicked to the
center of the field from the 10-yard line
and More made fifteen .yards by clever
dodging. The ten yards Reliance took to
put the ball ln play waa returned to Cali
fornia and the college men fought their
way to the last line only to be set back
ten "yards for off-side play. Again the
blue and gold team advanced to the last
line, but were held. "With four minutes
left to play and the third down staring
them in tho face Mora tried a drop kick
from the 20-yard line and failed. Again
Berkeley brought the ball to the danger
point and More tried another field goal,
but failed.
Coach Kelley tried a lot of new players
in the second half. Outside of the bril
liant run made by Smith, with the best -oT.
interference by Captain Pringle and the
touchdown made by Womble, the second
half was devoid of anything startling.
Reliance tried the mettle of Berkeley's
line in the second half and managed to
gain first down but three times. As usual
the collegians were able to go through
the Reliance line, but only for small
gains.
Coach Tost of Stanford watched tb.9
game and afterward stated that he
thought Stanford was in a position to
give Berkeley a hard fight on Thanks
giving day. He thinks. Berkeley has
splendid material, but it must be whipped
Into better shape to beat his pets.
Following are approximately .the
weights of the players, stripped, and the
The weather was too warm to bring out
fast work by either team. Old Sol's rays
were appreciated, however, by the enthu
siasts who lined the bleachers. Pretty
girls were present in large numbers and
the blue and gold rooter was seen and
heard throughout the game. California's
band helped things along with enlivening
music and two Berkeley youngsters madj
up for the lack of rough work ln th^
game by slugging each other before the
gathering. Ai Lean turned a few flip-
Hops and was ln his element looking after
both teams.
REX WOMBLE. the brilliant right
end of the California eleven, aajl
ed further fame to his already
well-known name by securing a
victory for his colleee over the
Reliance team on the Berkeley gridiron,
yesterday. The speedy end rushed down
the field and when the pigskin, propeiica
fifty yards by Johnny More's mighty rignt
foot, bounded from Rodolph's hands ana
then rolled over the goal line he clasped
it with as much joy as a parent would a
long lost child. His fellow players did not
stop to Jubilate over his clever move, but
grabbed him by the arms and dragged
him under the goal posts. Despite the
protestations of the athletic team a touch
down was scored for Berkeley and Quar-,
terback More essayed an easy goal, but
failed. Score: California 5, Reliance 0.
It was a hard fought contest and the
losers are commended on every side for
the gallant stand they made against the
collegians. The Reliance team battled
against heavy odds, but managed to keep
the blue and gold aggregation from roll
ing up a high score against them. Percy,
the fullback of the Lick team, who played
center for Reliance In the absence of
Weirs, was not only sixteen pounds
lighter than Cornish but had engaged in
a hard football contest in the 'morning
and was fatigued when he entered the
game. Hamilton was in a similar condi
tion from the same cause. That the cluD
men held the varsity eleven down to such
a small score Is not only remarkable Â£>ut
commendable. Three times when the
Berkeley eleven had advanced the pig
skin beneath their very goal posts the Re
liance team stiffened its line and secured
the ball on downs.
Dlnsmore's sensational tackle of i-<o
comotor" Smith on the five-yard line af
ter Berkeley's right half had made a
brilliant 55-yard run was the most spec
tacular event of the day. The little cap
tain of the athletic club eleven made a
flying leap for the runner and -caught
him Just when Smith's college mates saw
a touchdown in their grasp. The run wa3
a grand one, but the- tlyina tackle will
live ln football history on this coast.
Dinsmore's defensive work was also good,
as was the kicking of Rodolph and the
earnest work on the line by Monroe.

The Command* rate in question is: not
by ar.y means the only bad looking ride
that Spencer has been guilty of this sca
fon. The defeat of Ethf-lbert by David
Garrick in the Annual Champion stakes
at Sbeejishcad Bay caused quite as much
talk at the time as did the Commando
race. There was also a peculiar look ::bout
an event at (Saratoga when the heavily
backed Scotch Bush, the property of John
Sanford, was beaten. Doubiloss all thes*
races, when foiisidered together, bore tes
timony which the stewards considered
sufficiently siroiiR for thÂ»ir ruling, which
virtually mtans an end to Spencer's turf
career.
A few months apo Spencer enjoyed the
distinction of be'ns the best jockey in the
country, and at times he has certainly
electrified the pufcUc l>y his brilliant fin
ishes.
Such an extreme measure- as that would
not have bepr. resorted to without the
most positive nroof that something more
than a careless rid*- caused, the defeat of
the Messrs. Kvene'a great colt, but the
Jockey Club in it? wisdom prefers to keep

ffhe Biggerstaff concert set for Tuesday
evening and the California Club benefit
In the afternoon are the two musicrl
events of Importance for next week. Mr.
Blggerstaff's programme offers rare In
ducement to the music lover, and as this
Is the first concert the pianist has giver,
rlncc his return from Paris and Berlin It
will attract u. large contingent. He will
be assisted by. Mrs. Sedgeley Reynolds.
Last but not least of the week's pro
grammes comes the concert of Miss
Relda, our clever Calif ornian soprano.
Not for many moons has so representa
tive an audience been gathered together
as that which greeted Miss Relda on Fri
day evening last at Snerman, Clay & Co.'s
hall, and not for many moons mere has an
audience been so well satisfied with its
entertainment.
Hut four years- ago Miss Relda was a
student in San Francisco, with tempera
ment and ambition, it Is true, but not ap
parently to any large distinction. To-day
she is an artist, with a highly cultivated
voiceâ flexible, fluty and dellclously limpid
and liquid tone-^-a reilned and spiritueile
manner, a complete impersonation of the
French musical . genius. Her shading ts
delicately beautiful and If one finds occa
sionally a little lack of climax'it Is always
with the feeling that the .power is some
where in reserve and will some time make
its appearance.' "Her* genius Is essentially
French, the Gallic spirit- being perfectly
interpreted. But one noticed the want of
simplicity and .breadth in the otherwise
most gracefully rendered German sontrs;
hut if we do not hear great things of Miss
Relda on some near to-morrow set me
down as no prophet. . . '.
The singer's best numbers . were the
"Shadow Dance" and th$ "Perle du Bre
sil." admirably given Jn Â«oncert with Mr.
Newbaur, the flautist.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The quartet was assisted In the Tschai
kowsky sextet by Charles Helnsen, sec
ond viola, and William Wert3ch, second
violoncello. '
Last Friday's, programme Included a
Tschaikowsky Â«extet of symphonic pro
portions, the "Souvenir de Florence,"
which was given with fine verve and sym
pathy. It was *he first time of hearing
in San Francisco, but the number is
doubtless destined to a considerable pop
ularity in the future. The first movement
Is rather difficult of an immediate grasp,
but seems to promise much to further
hearing. The slow movement, a duet for
violin and cello, .with a harplike accom
paniment for the other instruments, and
of a purely Italian character, is a charm
ingly graceful composition, with a con
moto intermezzo like the laugh of a thou
sand elves at the lovers' song, sung on
cello and violin. The third and fourth
movements, with their wild, barbaric
rhythms, somber undertones and broad
free movement show the spirit of the Slav
from beginning to end. "Us a great work.
The Bobzoni quartet is a graceful and
charming number, with a fanciful adagio
showing a delicate and luxuriant imag
ination.
Of course, as music essential, without
extraneous fascinationsâ literary, as in
songs; scenic -and sensuous, as in opera
and otherwise â chamber music necessar
ily appeals only, to a limited audience' and
Inevitably seems to Impose a certain mar
tyrdom upon its public exponents. But
the appreciation which is called out Is of
consolingly high character, and is usually
held to be a sufficient compensationâ
luckily, for that is about the extent of
popular reward for the fine and sincere
artists who alone attempt this class of
musical work. The next Minettl concert,
given under the new conditions, is set for
December 14, and it is to be hoped thut
all lovers of chamber music will use their
best effort to make It the linancial success
it deserves to be. Â¦
It is to.be heartily regretted that the
excellent series of chamber music con
certs inaugurated by Giulio Minettl should
seem in danger of dying out for lack of
support on the part of the public: at least
the founder intimates that they can only
be continued hereafter on a subscription
basis, to insure. against further losses of
the kind already incurred.
At a meeting of the West End Improve

On the same evening an excellent pro
gramme was rendered by. the Lorlng Club
at the first concert of the twenty-fourth
season, held at Native Sons' -Hall under
the direction of David Loring. Several
new compositions were rendered by the
chorus, the work of which is, as utual
characterized by the same careful atten
tion to detail, attack, phrasing and sbad-
Inp which has distinguished it In- past
seasons. The programme given was -as
follows: >
On Thursday evening little Seta Stew
art. a child-pianist and pupil of William
Pluttl. made her first appearance in pub
lic at Sherman. Clay & Co.'s Hall and in
spite cf very evident nervousness created
a quite favorable Impression upon her au
dience. Her work shows good schooling.
a capacity for serious study and a consid
erable natural talent, perhaps even
amounting to genius. She has a pretty
delicate touch, a fluent technique, a light'
fine tone, a little lacking in strength
however, and while there were wrong
notes a-plenty throughout the rather am
bitious programme It was easily seen to
be the result of unaccustomed surround
ings. The little girl -s 12 years old now
and her next appearance Is* looked for
ward to with Interest. Among the num
bers on the programme perhaps the most
satisfactorily given were the Beethoven
sonata (op. 14, No. 1). the Wagner-LIz3t
"Spinning Song." which was rendered In
picturesque fashion, and the Wollenhaura
"Le Dernier Sourlre."
Mrs. Birmingham's numbers, which in
cluded "La Cloche" of Saint Saer.s "Don
pelganger" of Schubert and Brahms and
Wagner songs, were given with the
warmth and finish which distinguish the
work of this clever lady. Mr. Weiss did
excellent service in the Pratt trio, which
is a scholarly and rather graceful com
position. Mr. Maurer's accompaniments to
the violin were a little lacking: in discre
tion, the piano part frequently over
weighting the rather light tone of the vio
lin, but his work shows temperament,
spirit, color and a fine rhythmic sense
and In the accompaniments to the voice
left nothing to be desired.
The Hother Wlsmer affair, which came
first, opened the programme In auspiclouj
fashion on Tuesday evening with a violin
and song recital in which Mr. Wismer
was assisted by Mrs. J. E. Birmingham,
Arthur Weiss and Fred Maurer.
The young violinist is; to be congratulat
ed on a steady progress to a high artistic
Ideal. His work possesses a certain deli
cate distinction, the classic air. and is
further characterized by a delightfully
pure tone, true Intonation ana an easy
and refined execution. It lacks somewhat
In color, climax and authority, but these
are the faults of youth and will doubtless
vanish with the coming years. Mr. V.'is
mer's rendering of the favorite Mendels
sohn concerto was most pleasing, the last
movement especially Â«-*iowing a remark
able grace and fluency of execution. He
also gave the Gade sonata in D minor,
the Spanish Dance â No. 8. of Sarasate.
and took part in a trio for piano, violin
and cello by a. local composer, John Har
raden Pratt.
The week last past -ras unusually rich
in musical interest, no less than half a
dozen important concerts and recitals be
ing on the list.
In "The Mayor of Plymouth Rock," a
comic opera of most ambitious plan, re
quiring eighteen principals, a chorus of
forty and an orchestra numbering sixty
members for its interpretation, the next
t.astÂ«-r:i season will hear the latest prod
uct of Mr. Kuttner's genius. The opera
will be given in New York under the F.
C. Whitney management and will be one
of the most Important productions of its
class that will be heard next season.

also conductor of the Dorothy Morton

the first productionâ under F. C. Whit

a furor in Berlin at the present time.
Mr. Kuttner also conducted the first pro

will hardly be warrant for surprise, when
It is understood that Alfred J. Kuttner.
formerly capellmeister at the Court
Theater. Weimar. Germany (to the Duke
of Meiningen), and a conductor and com
poser of high reputation, is in charge of
the aforesaid musical programme.
Perhaps Mr. Kuttner Is most familiarly
known to San Francisco as the composer
of "The Evil Eye." which ran so long and
joyfully at the Tivoll during the last sea
son, and this is but bne of his many
claims to operatic distinction. Mr. Kutt-
ONE of the most interesting and
remarkable productions in that
class of musical composition
known as programme music is
the Berlioz "Symphonie Fantas
tique." in which tbe composer attempts to
translate the weird dreams of a despair
ing lover, who has sought relief In death
by a poisonous draught. The opiate fails
of its purpose, hut throws him into a pro
found stupor. Jn -which beautiful and
frightful visions possess him with all the
sweetness and terror of rea'.ity. The
symphony iÂ« divided into five parts,
"Dreams and Passions." "The Ball." "A
Scene in the Fields." "March to the Scaf
fold" ar.d "The Witches' Sabbath."
As to thfl murirai riphteourness or t:n

command an orchestra cf sixty of the
most competent musicians that San
Francisco can rupp'.y. All the necessary
instruments are represented and the body
of tone will be amply sufficient to fill the
hall. Altogether u very satisfactory ren

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 20.â The State
Board of Education met Â»t the Capitol
to-day and unanimously agreed to aban
don the Keyes manuscript for a grammar
grade "History of the United States,"
which has already cost the State the sum
of $3500. The Keyes manuscript of a
primary, school history may also be aban
doned, the board at to-day's session hav
ing referred to a committee, consisting of
President Benjamin Ide "Wheeler and Pro
fessor E. E. Brown, the advisability of
reconsidering the vote by which the
manuscript tor that history was adopted.
President Wheeler said he had ex
amined the Keyes manuscript for the
grammar grade history In the hope that
he could find something in it which
would, make It useful in- the public
schools, but had not succeeded. He re
garded it as- in no sense a history, and
moved not to recommend it to any private
firm for printing, much less to advise the
State to use it as one of Its text books.
It was decided to suspend for one month
the life ' diploma . of J. O. Cromwell of
Sonoma County for unprofessional con
duct In having permitted collusion among
pupils in their studies.
The applications of Knox and Lombard
colleges of Gettysburg-, 111, for accrediting
power, were rejected. The board before
adjournment awarded the following cer
tificates to teach:

Leaves Home October 12 to Visit His
Lawyer in San Francisco and
Has Not Been Seen
Â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. &>.
Manuel Souza Bettencourt, a prosperous
farmer of Moraga Valley, has disappeared
as completely as if the ground had opened
up and swallowed him. Since October 12,
when he left home ostensibly on a busi
ness trip to San Francisco, his family has
not heard from him, and Mrs. Bettencourt
has begun to fear that her husband has
met with foul play. Friends of the family
across the bay who have been communi
cated with have not seen or i heard from
the missing rancher, and this heightens 1
the wife's belief that he has met with
some injury.
Manuel Bettencourt, the 18-year-old son
of the missing man, reported to Sheriff
Rogers this afternoon the fact of his
father's- disappearance and asked the as
sistance of the authorities in locating him.
"Father left home a week ago yester
day," said the boy. "He told us he was
going to Ban Francisco to see a lawyer
about some land trouble and would be
back the next morning. He carried enough
money with him to pay his expenses, but
I think no more. We know of no enemies
he might have had. as the trouble over
the land is of a trivial nature.
"Alter waiting for father's return until
to-day we made up our minds to report
the case to the Sheriff. It is possible he
may have been struck on the head on the
lonely road and after being robbed rolled
down a ravine. Then he initrht have met
with an accident after reaching San Fran
cisco."
Bettencourt is one of the best known
Portuguese farmers of Moraga Valley,
where he has lived for over twenty years.
He is 4S years of age and has a wife n.nd
three children. The missing man is tall,
heavy set and wears a full black beard.

More than ordinary Interest will necessarily

The report of the Arizona Copper Company,

Major S. M. 'Davis, mineral agent of the
El Paso Chamber of Commerce, has made a
report on Tombstone. He makes the sanguine
forecast that "when this part of the territory
is properly advertised there will be a dozen
Cripple Creeks scattered over Southern Ari
zona."
Los Angeles moneyed men are reported to b a .
hopeful that a emelter can be built in Los
Angeles. The field for Us operations will be
found In tfce ores on the Colorado and Mojave
deserts, in the Coast Range Mountains, in
Southern California, Southern Arizona. South
era Utah and Nevada, on the west coast of
Mexico and' In Lower California. These orts
are now sent hundreds of miles to find f>

The assessments levied are faomething like

a balance of large size still in favor of the
lode. What the future will develop is a mat
ter of conjecture. The contract for power is
at the maximum rate of *S per horsepower
up to E0O0 horsepower. The cost has been here
tofore much higher, ranging even as >i!gh a*
$25. Cheap power and modern pumps to drain
the lower levels will enable the mine owners
to reach that which has been Inaccessible. The
actual value of the Comstock ftiines will come
nearer an absolute determination.

According to the Scott Valley Advance there
is a chance that the name of a part of the
somewhat famous Coffee Creek district will be
changed. The Advance says that: "So much
prejudice exists In the minds of strangers
against the term "Coffee Creek* that mine
owners on the 'tellurlde' belt are considering
the advisability of detaching their portion of
the so-called .'Upper Coffee Creek' district and
giving it a new name. For It has been sug
gested the name of Altamont, which Is em
inently significant, a* It Is without doubt the
most elevated 'mining, district In the northern
part of the State, claims varying in altitude
from 6500 to 80WV feet. This new district In
cludes the Lawrence. Carr and Gulick camp*
and the recent discoveries on the head of Swift
Creek."
The Superior Court In Tuolumne County has
decided a suit of considerable Interest, involv
ing the title to the Rhode Island mine. The
plaintiff was John F. Callahan and the de
fendants John P. James et al. The decision
was In favor of the plaintiff, holding that
the mine was reserved In the grant of the
townslte of Groveland. In 1854 Thomas C. Reii
located what is now the Rhode Island mine
and he conveyed It later, through others, to
J. F. Callahan. the present claimant. In 1S7J
J. D. Redmond received a United States pa
tent to the townslte. which patent, among
other things, provided that "no title Is thereby
acquired to any mine of gold, silver, cinnabar
or copper, or to any valid mining claim or
possession held under existing laws. At the
time, of the survey and entry Lawrence Mur
ray was living with his family on land ad-
Joining the north, and east boundary of the
exterior lines of the townslte and continued
to live there until his death. The property
of Murray's estate was then set aside by the
Superior Court to his widow, Joanna A. Mur
ray, and four surviving children. Mrs. Mur
ray married C. H. Wilson, one of the defend
ants In the suit just settled. She executed a
deed to Wilson of lot 8, ' block 6, on, which Is
situated the Rhode Island mine. On Septem
ber 6, 1879, Judge Redmond, before leaving for
England, executed to the persons .whose names
appeared upon the official map of the Grove
land townslte and who had not already re
ceived them, deeds of the lots to the different
parties as shown by the map; among them be
ing one to Lawrence Murray for the said lot
8 of block 6. Judge Redmond left these deeds
with James Tannahill and after the tatter's
death they came Into the possession of his
widow, Mary A. Tannahill, and later, in 1889.

gold belts, each r^bout twenty-five miles wide,
running from the coast inland across French,
Dutch and Hrttlsh Guiana. The French, be
ing nearest the seashore, was mined first. Then

made. It was purely accidental.

Mr. Lanite Is a well preserved old gentleman,
72 years cf age, and for eighteen years had a
bad double rupture which no treatment could
ccpe with. After a short use of the Rice
method the .left rupture healed entirely and the
right was almost closed in a few weeks. To-
day he Is aa sound as a dollar, wears no truss
or ether support, and his euro Is only one of
hundreds of similar cases reported by those
who use the .Rice method. Send for this free
trial. Don't be backward. It will surprise you
with Its wonderful power to heal. And If you
know of other ruptured people ask them to
write or. write for them. Do not fall to write
at once: do so to-day.

vented a method that cures without pain, dan-
ger, operation or an hour's loss of time from
the day's work. To avoid all questions of doubt
he sends free to every sufferer a free trial of
his method and there can be no earthly reason
why any one, rich or poor, should not avail
themselves of this generous offer. As an In-
stance of this remarkable method, the cure of
Charles Lnnge. Morrison, 111., Is a welcome
piece of intelligence.

THE HAGUE, Oct. 20.-Queen "Wilhel
mina and her betrothed, Duke Henry of
Mecklenburg-Schwerln, accompanied by
the Queen's mother, arrived here this

comed. The future consort of the Queen

MONEY IS STXLIi
PLENTIFUL IN ENGLAND
Worth Less in London Than in New
York and Further Shipments of
Gold Considered Probable.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â Money throughout
the week has been abundant and it was
difficult some, days to find day to day bor
rowings at VA per cent. With floating
money worth less than in New York,
Paris and Berlin, with the open market
rate of discount .below New York and
Berlin, and with New York exchange not
appreciably higher than Paris, further
gold shipments, the Statist thinks, are
probable. The Statist says:
"That the American bankers are more
unwilling to disturb the market and that
they will not take gold from the Bank of
England we firmly believe. But their
ability to refrain depends on the extent of
the demands on them for cash for the
interior. With the cotton/ crop yet to bo
moved the bankers may be obliged to
withdraw a portion of their balances from
London."
The Statist gathers that statistics show
India during the year ending September
] absorbed sixty million ounces of silver â
fifty million ounces for coinage and ten
million ounces for ornaments. This, the
Statist says, is nearly 40 per cent of the
world's production, and the paper pre
dicts that the Indian Government will be
a constant and large buyer of silver.
The report that Russia is negotiating a
loan of Â£20,000,000 in New York and Paris
the Statist regards as intended to "feel
the pulse of both cities." There is little
inclination in Paris to bring out a great
Russian loan. Although amply supplied.
Paris finds the rates lower and other
European money markets being unsatis
factory, it Is considered advisable still,
according to the Statist, to await the re
sult of the American elections. Continu
ing, the paper says:
"Presumably one of the conditions of
raising a loan In New York would be that
railway materials, etc., should be bought
by Russia from America. This would not
be attractive to France, which, if -willing
to lend at all, will prefer to raise the
whole amount than have Russian trade
f avors diverted to the United States.
Consequently it is unlikely that two loans
will be raised contemporaneously in New
York and Paris."
BRYAN" ENDS NEW YORK TOUR.
Will Next Make a Trip Through "West
Virginia.
BUFFALO, N. Y., Oct. 20.â Mr. Bryan
concluded his tour-day campaign through
the State of New York with, two large
meetings in this city to-night. One of
these meetings was held at the Broad
way Market'and was an open-air gather
inp and the other at Convention Hall.
Before reaching Buffalo he had made fif
teen addresses during the day, beginning
with a thirty-minutes speech at E!mlra at
9 o'clock in the morning. The other
places at which he spoke were Corning,
Bath, Coshocton, Wayland, Livonia,
Avon.Spencerport. Brockport, Holly, Al
bion. Medina, Mlddleport, Lockport and
Niagara Falls.- Â¦
' The attendance at most of the day meet
ings was good and at some of them quite
large. The audiences could not be said
to be enthusiastic as a rule, but every
where the Democratic Presidential candi
date was accorded most careful attention
and respectful treatment.
During his" State tour Mr. Bryan has
made about sixty-five different speeches
and has quite thoroughly traversed the
central belt of the State from east to
west. He left this city to-night at 12
o'clock fof Huntington. W. Va., where he
Â¦will begin a one-day trip across West "Vir
ginia Monday morning.
REDMOND'S MANIFESTO
TO THE NATIONALISTS
Says the Results of the Recent Sec
tions Show the Parnellite
Split Is Ended. â¢
LONDON, Oct. 20.â John Redmond, M.
P., : . chairman | of 1 the Irish Parliamentary
party, has issued a manifesto to the Na
tionalists In which he 6ay s he finds that
the results of the elections show that tho
Parnellite split ia ended and 1 that there
is a universal desire for a united move
ment .based on ParnelPa policy of holding
aloof from all English parties. He thinks
the Conservative majority Is unwieldy
and contains seeds for an early disrup
tion. -;> :
Mr. Redmond - therefore urged the
maintenance of unity, discipline in the
Nationalist ranks and the adoption of a
fearless and aggressive policy to combat
the Conservatives In and out of Palia
ment. - . w - Â¦. -
. Mr. Redmond also .indorsed ? the United
Irish Leagrue, - saying the election proved
that the Nationalists were overwhelming
ly in sympathy with it. ; v.
Dwight KLf , Andrews.
ANTIOCH, 111.', Oct. 20.â After an iilness
of two days Dwight â¢ M. Andrews, Chief
Grain ; Inspector under. Governor Altgeld
filed here to-day from paralysis. '
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 20.â The com
memoration day exercises of the one hun
dred and fifty-fourth year of the founding
of the university were held in Alexander
Hall to-day before a very large audience.
The board of trustees and the faculty, led
by President Patton, Secretary of State
John Hay and Bishop Henry Yates. Sat
terlee of Washington, marched in a'body
to the hall. President Patton made an .in
troductory .address, in which he an
nounced that at the meeting of the trus
tees yesterday action was taken by the
board to elect some distinguished gradu
ate to further the movement of estab
lishing: a graduate department. An elec
tion to this office will be made later on.
He also announced that a new officer
would be elected to be known as the uni
versity secretary. President Patton pre
sented the need of a gymnasium and
urged the concerted action of the alumni
toward securing the necessary funds for
its erection. Commenting upon the action
granting the alumni direct representation
in electing five members to the board no
said this was the most important an
nouncement he had ever made since he
became president of ihe university.
Bishop Satterlee delivered an address
on "The Ethics of American Civiliza
tion," in which he denied that the Gov
ernment of the United States had devel
oped imperialistic tendencies. "The na
tion," he said, "has less greed for terri
tory to-day than when Jefferson bought
Louisiana, or Monroe Florida, or Seward
Alaska, and far less than when the an
nexation of Texas brought on the Mexi
can war. We had no' taought whatever of
territorial aggrandizement when we went
to war with Spain and, now before we
had time to realize thai full meaning of
passing events certain islands as the re
sult of that war have become de facto an
actual part of the United States. We can
not go back if we would from these new
responsibilities which have been thrust
upon us. j
"The greatest danger of all is the peril
of an arrested development. Whatever
has life must grow or it must decay. If
on the other hand there is danger of de
parting from the original ideal of Ameri
can civilization on the other hand there
is equally imminent danger of becoming
shortsighted in our views of our coun
try's future, of failing to read the signs
of the times and to realize the historic
situation as It stands to-day."
At the close of Bishop Satterlee'3 ad
dress Professor "Woodthrow Wilson pre
sented Secretary Hay to President Pat
ton, who conferred upon him the degree
of doctor of laws.
Professor LIbbey piaced the official
gown upon Mr. Hay. who was the recip
ient of a rousing student cheer and pro
longed applause. Mr. Hay addressed the
audience as follows:
"My gratitude for this distinguished
honor is not diminished â it is rather en
hanced by the sense of my personal un
worthiness of It. I accept it, sir, with
deep appreciation, for I am allowed to
interpret it as a sign of your approval of
the manner in which I and my colleagues
in the Government have, under the di
rection of the President, conducted ths
foreign relation of this country for the
past two years. They have been years of
much labor and many perplexities, and if
any measure of success has attended our
efforts It has been due not to any strength
of ability of mine but to the fact that
our course was so clearly marked out
for us by a century of national traditions,
from which we have never swerved. ,We,
have believed the country, as our fathers
did, in its high and beneficent destiny and,
so believing:, we needed to admit no other
considerations than those of the national
welfare; we had to hearken to no voice
but the call of duty and honor. I hope I
may even say that the light which has
guided me has been of kin to that bright
influence which has made this great uni
versity for eo many generations a radiant
beacon to the continent, of learning* and
morals. In the brief space of public ser
vice which may yet be mine I can have
no loftier inspiration than the desire to
become less unworthy the honor you have
done me and the responsibility you have
laid upon me."
Says the Greatest Danger of All to
the Nation Is the Peril of
an Arrested Devel
opment.
ANNIVERSARY
OF THE FOUNDING
OF PRINCETON
Bishop Satterlee Denies That
the Government Is
Imperialistic.
PANAMA, Colombia, Oct. 8.â Little 13
known in any part of Colombia regarding
the conditions' existing in the other sec
tions of the country. Such points as: are
connected by telegraph or cable are held
by the Government, and at such places
the bulk of news contains grandiloquent
statements of victories achieved over the
rebels. â¢ â¢;
The fact remains, however, that the
civil war goes ' merrily on. The country j
is being drained of all its resources and
the m,ost pitiful poverty prevails in alL
directions. The interior of this naturally
fertile and rich land is devastated. Co
lombia will at the end of the war be a
country of paupers.
The city ot Cucuta, the erstwhile liberal
stronghold near the Venezuelan frontier,
was recently captured by the Government
fc.ces after a siege of twenty days. Ac
counts of the acts of brutality and the
horrifying scenes that met the eye at the
surrender of Cucuta have appeared in the
newspapers of- Maracaibo, Venezuela.
This place, it appears, was nearly razed
to the ground. Bodies lay in the debrl3
in the streets in a state of putrefaction.
A drunken soldiery was let loose amid
the nearly starved inhabitants and every
sort of bestiality waS committed. Just
now the unfortunate city is again being
besieged, but this time by the Liberals,
two thousand strong, and the Government
is unable to raise the siege.
The latest reports from the interior of
this country purport that the Liberals,
who only a short time ago appeared to be
completely exhausted and who suffered
a tremendous moral setback with the
failure of their attempt to take posses
sion of the isthmus of Panama, have un
dergone a vigorous reaction, induced
mainly by the confusion which followed
Vice President Moroquin's coup d'etat. It
is admitted even by the Government offi
cials that the Liberal forces are in pos~
session of the Department of Vollvar and
that the cities of Cartagena and Barran
quilla, which are â¢ on the banks of the
Magdalena River, near its mouth, and
consequently constitute practically the
only means of access from the Atlantic to
the interior, and Bogota, the capital, are
surrounded by the Liberal "army." On
the Pacific seaboard the Liberals hold the
port of Tumace, while the Government
has succeeded in keeping- Buena Ventura,
which is the terminus of the Government
telegraph wires from the capital and is
also connected .with the outside world by
cable.
Throughout the whole extent of this re
public a chronic guerrilla warfare Is con
ducted. This civil contest is one of the
most sanguinary that has ever raged in
those countries.

UNITF.T> STATES BONDS
The Oceanic Steamship Company has declared
a dividend of 50c per share, payable on Novem
ber 1. .
STOCK AND hOND EXCHANGE.
The following were ex-dlvidend yesterday:
California Fruit Canners' Association. 60c;
California Powder, }1; Central Light and Pow
er. 5c: Hutchlnson Sugar P, 25c; Spring: Val
ley Water, 42a. '
The assessment of 25c on St. Lawrence Oil
falls delinquent October 30. and that of 25c on
McKlttrick OH on November 19.
Business was dull on the Bond Exchange,
with declining quotations for Makaweli Sugar,
Gas and Electric and Spring Valley Water, as
will be seen by the list of sales.
The oil stocks continued to make a good
showing and prices were generally firm.
EASTERN MARKETS.
wringing profits out cf the bears by the de
velopment of an outside buying interest which
attained notable proportions and made itself
felt to a degree also by investment buying of
bonds. Last week's good bank statement and
the large engagements of gold for Import,
which continued this week, gave general en
couragement and the hope was entertained that
the crucial strain on the market had now
parsed and that the resources would prove suf
ficient to meet the unexpected heavy demands.
This hope had additional warrant from the
falling o!T during the week of the interior de- ,
raand for money and larger supply of money
secured by the operations with the Sub-Treas
ury by reason of pension payments and the
larger drafts payable against gold deposits with
the Government at Pacific Coast points. The
reports of Improvement In the Iron and steel
trade, the settlement of the coal miners' strike
and the fact that the average gross earnings
of railroads for the first week in October show- '
; ed an increase again over last year after those
' for the last week in September had fallen off,
, all helped to stimulate the bullish sentiment,
i But the buoyant rise In prices offered attrac
i tive profits to speculators who had sold stocks
j during the long period of inertness and leth
i argy in the market. At the same time the clos
' ing out of large short interests took out of the
market an important support to prices. Look
ing beyond the Immediate present conditions in
the money market, speculators saw some cause
i for renewed apprehension of high rates for
: money. Therefore, by the latter part of the
: week there was again a well defined and in
' fiuenrlal bear party maklnsr Itself evident in the
operations on the Stock Exchange. This par
ty's efforts to work declines were no means
unopposed and the speculative conflict thus
waged caused a very unsettled and irregular
stock market until the general upward move
ment of Frlda". There were widely divergent
movements in some of the minor stocks, but
where a contest between speculative Interests
centered in one stock, as in Union Pacific, the
effect was seen in an astonishingly narrow
price movement on an enormous volume of
dealings. There, is much uncertainty among
the best authorities regarding the further move
ment of gold from abroad and the undoubted
ability of New York to force gold homeward
If necessary may upset the European money
market.
Business in bonds has been considerably
larger and prices of many Issues have ad-. I
vanced. United States new 4s advanced H and j
refunfling 2s and old 4s hi per cent over the i
call of a week ago.

NEW TORK, Oct. 20.â The tentative oppo
sition which has been offÂ«rÂ»>d to the upward
course of Trices for two days j>ast by a con
elderafcle btcrish clement of professional
traders was wholly abandoned to-day. Prices
moved upward without important ?Â¦xeeption and
alcoO without Interruption.- Considering thÂ«
very larce volume cf tire dealings, the move
ment of prices of the majority of stocks was
furpririrgly email. The larger and eager de
mand from outside sources was, in fact, pretty
FtÂ«-ad!i>- fed by the outside scalpers who were
takin- their profits. But the undertone of flrm
r.cf-s Â»as shown by the prompt decline In the
oflterings irtwa there was the slightest yielding
In Â»ric*s. There TverÂ© a few clocks, also, in
â¢which there vcre Ftlrrinsr upward movements,
notably in the stÂ«-*-l and iron group. American
Hoop was then leader and was strong from the
outset. Federal iStfel encountered some oppo
ritlon to the advance in the early dealings, but
ultimately became v< ry buoyant Jn tone. The
Â¦wholtr group caae into the movement under this
leadership anJ advanced from 1 to 3*4, the lat
ter figure lor American Hoop. The feature
â¢was an er,s*-TiUa! factor In the buoyant tone of
the whole market at the close. Pacific Mail
Â¦was marked u& - points without any news to
account for the rise. The buying was attri

greatly prone to historical analogies, found
themselves impressed v.ith the recollection of
Â¦what happened to the Fto^k market at this time
four years ago. and they argue that the ten

raremer.ts until after clr-ction warranted the
Â«-xpÂ«!CÂ»ation of a decline in prices before elec
tion, tuch as occurred four years ago, but the
eudden turn of circumstances last n.ck toward
the relief of the threatened stringency in the
New Tork money market gave opportunity for
the watchful bull contingent in stocks to af

Silver was strong on the short settlement, the
Russo-China and general speculative demands.
Money was scarce.
The American department was especially
active. Professional speculators were heavy
buyers, bat many dealers waited to-day for the
first time in many months for the opening in
V/all street. Berlin bought Northern Pacific
shares in spite of the overnight selling orders
from New York.
Business on the Stock Exchange to-day was
much brisker than It Is usually on Saturday.
The close was strong on the official announce
ment of the Anglo-German agreement to main
tain in China the open door without partition.
Hut the weakness of New York exchange
checked the advance of British consols.
NEW TORK. Oct. 20.â The Commercial 'Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
NEW TORK. Oct. 20.â The Financier says:
ThÂ» statement of the New York associated
banks for the week ending October 20, taking
everything into consideration, was of a favor
able character. The clearing Institutions, de
; epite the drain of J5.305.200 cash from their
already depleted holdings, managed to min
imize the effect of the reduction by a radleal
contraction in loans, which operated to re
duce deposits and therefore released the per
centage of cash heretofore locked up as re
serve. In brief the -present volume of deposits
calls for nearly $3,800,000 less cash reserve than
at the clofe of the previous week and as the
actual cash outgo was, as stated, $5,305,200,
the surplus was reduced only $1,516,225, leav
ing the excess still held above the legal re
quirements t2.947.7OO. It is usually calculated
that all the banks are required to ntalntain
2*> per cent of their deposits in cash. This is
true In the case of the national banks, but
there are in the Clearing-house Association
eighteen State banks, which aj-e legally not
compelled to do so, although they usually at
tempt to keep the higher percentage. As a.
matter of fact the power of the banks to loan
money Is greater than the excess reserve totals
indicate. The outlook, however, does not favor
the possibility of the banks having to resort
Â¦ to their extra legal powers. The demand for
! currency from the South has abated largely
; and receipts of specie, both from Europe and
; the Pacific Coast, will foot up nearly ten mil
; lions before the end of next week. In ad-
I dltion to this the treasury is losing money
! to the banks, so that their gains will be much
; abo\-e the outgo. At the same time it cannot
1 be said that rates on loans will respond in-
Etantly to these factors. The concentration of
ten millions In loans In the face of an active
stock market is unnatural and is not to bÂ«
looked for as a regular feature. The near ap
proach of the flection does nqt seem to be
changing the policy cf the banks in any re
spect. The decrease of sixty-one millions in de
poelts since the middle of September is to ba
ascribed solely to crop season operations. Cir
culation is still expanding and is now well
above all previous records, standing at about
t3O,500,000.

Judge Carroll Cook rendered a long de
cision yesterday in which he declares that
the recent laundry ordinance passed by
the Board of Supervisors, which provides
that all public laundries In all parts of
the city and county shall cease washing,
ironing and mangling clothes between the
hours of 7 p. m. and 6 a. m.. Is unconsti
tutional. The case was brought before him
on a writ of habeas corpus at the instance
of Yee Yick, who was convicted by Judge
Cabaniss of violating the ordinance. At
torney Madden represented Tick.
The Judge after referriog to the opin
ions expressed !n what is known as tha
"barbers' case" and other case3 says:
"The ordinance in its preamble states
that the establishment in this city and
county of laundries is Injurious to the
public health and causes deterioration in
the value of property. That portion of
the ordinance cannot be considered lor
any purpose. This Uias been settled In
several cases. Not being, per se, a nui
sance or dangerous to health, what, rea
son can support .the prohibition of the
laundry business on the outskirts of our
peninsula or at a place within the cor
porate limits of the city â of which therÂ©
are many â Isolated from other habita
tions? Yet this ordinance does not limit
its provisions to the inhabited portions of
the city. It declares a laborer guilty of
crime if he works between 7 p. m. and 6
a. in. in a laundry situate miles apart
from any other buildingâ anywhere within
the limits of the city â even if such laun
dry should be located upon a scow moored
in the bay. Its great vice is in its scope.
"What possible reason can be advanced
why- a laundry on Goat Island or out on
the Cliff House beach or on Twin Peaks or
at Ocean View or on the bay. where there
is not a neighbor to be disturbed, should
not be allowed to keep his laundry open
and labor therein all night if he wishes
to? Every other tradesman or laborer or
artisan, including the foundryman. the
carpenter, the baker and the blacksmith,
can do so. Why should such a laundry
man be compelled to close at 7 o'clock at
night? Is any one injured or disturbed
ln Fuch localities either In health or quiet?
"I am satisfied that with its provisions
extending to the broad limits that they
do that section 4 of this ordinance cannot
be held to be a health or police regulation
at all. much less a reasonable one. The
exception to the return is sustained, the
writ is therefore dismissed and the pris
oner discharged."
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
asked for a ptay of execution for ten days
in order that he might consult with the
Board of Supervisors as to taking the case
on appeal to the Supreme Court, and It
was granted. Deuprey had a consultation
with Chief Sullivan and the Chief agreed
not to make any arrests under the ordi
nance till it was decided whether to ap
peal to the higher court.
Prisoners Sent to Jail.
John Laplaue, who, on November 15
last, forged the name of Philippe Moy
sounave to a note for $S00 and who suf
fered conviction for the commission of the
crime, was sentenced to serve nine years
ln Folsom Prison by Judge Dunne yes
terday. Lapique will appeal to the Su
preme Court from the decision of the
lower court. Harry E. Raynes. who was
Jointly charged with Violet Brooks of
having robbed a pallor of $35, was sen
tenced to three years ln Folsom for his
offense. Violet Brooks will be sentenced
next Saturday. John Williams, who
pleaded guilty to a charge of simple
assault, was sentenced to ninety days In
the County Jail.

William A. Brown has loved and lost.
His property, according to him, is Includ
ed among the things lost. In a suit filed

that he has been victimized out of prop
erty at 512. Golden -Gate avenue, ; furniture
valued at $2500 and $3000 in gold, his loss
aggregating over $25,000.
Some time ago, Brown alleges, he met
Mrs. Whitney. . She bad been divorced
from Abbott L. Whitney and was lone
some. So was he. , He took ; her â¢ to \ his
home, he avers, and there for some time
they lived as husband and wife; Finally
he consented to marry her, and in view of
his great affection for her and. influenced
by her pleadings he transferred half -his
property from his to her . name.. Shortly
after the transfer of the property he
claims her former. husband began to visit
