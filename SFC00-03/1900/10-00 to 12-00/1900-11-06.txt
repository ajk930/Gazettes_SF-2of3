Under the new arrangement these roads

is to lessen the competition and to make

story has it that the syndicate is to reach
into this territory as well as control cer
tain Western systems by buying in the
Clover Leaf and then making overtures
for the possession of the "Wheeling and

nucleus of a larger syndicate In the West

m Klnley lawn, so famous in the
I . J campaign of 1S96. was to-night
â¢ the scene of an enthusiastic
demonstration similar to that
which closed the campaign of four years
ago. The President was prevailed upon
to depart from his rule, which, in the face
of much pressure, has been inflexible all
through the campaign, and he made a
short address to his neighbors and fellow
townsmen, free from partisanship, but
apropos, of the election to-morrow. He
also introduced Judge Day for a short
speech from the famous front porch. The
occasion was an unadvertised and unan
nounced serenade by the "Grand Army
Band," with several thousand people fol
lowing the band with cheers and hurrahs
and a glare of red fire that illuminated
the whole scene about the McKinley
home.
The band appeared upon the streets
some time after dark, and the report that
the President was to be serenaded spread
like wildfire. First a score fell In behind
the band, then another score, then hun
dreds, and finally, by the time the McKin
ley home was reached, thousands. Some
where, no one knows how, a supply of red
fixe torches was secured and they were
burning at their height when the cheers
of the crowd around the house drowi.ci
the music of the band. Two or three se
lections were played in the street in front
of the house and then the band was in
vited to the front of Mrs. McKlnley's
parlot for another selection. â¢
After each number there had been calls
for the President, and finally he appeared
on the porch. He bowed to the crowds in
front of him and to his right and to his
left amid deafening cheers. There -were
calls for a speech, and some one pulled
from the vestibule of the house a relic
of the campaign of four years ago, a Ttn
nessee stump,' with polished top and en
graved emblem, brought here by a Ten
nessee delegation. The President stood
upon this and spoke as follows:
"My fellow citizens: I am very glad to
greet you once more at my old home. This
is not a .year when I am making speeches.
To-morrow - from one end ot the vast
tions be an accident. There is no earthly
excuse for the return to the conditions
that existed before the present adminis
tration. The people know what is before
them, and if they vote against their own
Instincts it is their own fault.
"The morrow promises success. The
great parade of Saturday in New York
shows that the business men are aroused.
For'hour after hour \hey -'marched in the
rain to testify to their devotion to the
cause of the nation and the flag, and it
augurs success." ' . Â¦;&*
Governor Roosevelt then discussed in a
general way the national issues. He was
frequently cheered, and at the close of
the meeting was tendered a reception.
TROUBLE FEARED AT DENVBB.
Registration Lists Alleged to Be
Padded, and . Conflicts Expected.
DENVER, Nov. 5.â The registration ha3
been, largely Increased throughout Colo
rado this year, mainly through the ac
tivity of the women voters. In Denver
69.016 names are registered, 20,000 more
than in 18%. Charges of padding the reg
istration and colonizing have been made
pn both sides. On the national ticket the
question appears to be merely' the size of
Bryan's majority. The fusion State
ticket will not receive the entire Bryan
vote, but its success is regarded as prob
able nevertheless. The next Legislature
will elect a United States Senator to suc
ceed Walcott, and the fufalonlsts claim
that not over a dozen members pledged to
Walcott \ will be elected. Judge Hallett
in the United States District Court to
day made an order, forbidding- United
States Marshal Bailey to appoint deputies
to serve at the polls to-morrow. Â¦> Sheriff
Jones . at Arapahoe County has sworn, in
500 or C00 Republicans as deputies to servb
at the polls in this city and the Demo

feared conflicts may occur at some of the
polling places to-morrow. The Republican
County Committee ; to-day published a list
of over 5000 names on the registration lists

NEW YORK, Nov. 5.â Governor
Roosevelt wound up the Re
publican national campaign to
night by delivering an address
at Oyster Bay, L. I., before one
of the largest gatherings that ever as
sembled at that place. Prior to the meet
ing there was a parade, led by five bands.
When the Governor appeared ho was
greeted by long continued applause. He
said in part:
"In this campaign I have not only ap
pealed in my speeches to the Republicans
but to all who have the honor and integ
rity of the country at heart. I have ap
pealed to higher motives than partisan

appealed to all, whether agreeing or dis
agreeing with me in politics, to stand by
their country. I have appealed to the
teachings of Jefferson and Jackson and of
Lincoln. Mr. Jefferson was an expansion
ist, and he it was who expanded over Ne
braska and governed the Indians without
their consent. The Indians have been suc
ceeded by the Populists, and they are gov
erned without their consent.
"Mr. Croker says he Is In politics for his

quoting him. As for Jackson, he was tor

Later Mayor Van Wyck made the fol

"There will be no Intimidation or vio

quietly as that of a country village. The
Chief of Police will take charge of that
and will preserve ore*. I have the ut

Chief Devery said that there would be
no trouble at the polls to-morrow and
that he would enforce the orders of the
Mayor to the letter.
ONLY A TAMMANY TRICK.
Spurious Letter Warning Republican
Voters of Impending 'Arrest.
NEW YORK, Nov. 5.â Republicans
Â¦who. had given the time of their residence
in their election districts as thirty days
were much worried to-day upon receiv
ing what purported to be a warning let
ter sent out by the National Protective
Association, city of New York, and dated
at 1 Madison av'enue," where the head
quarters of the Republican National and
County committees are located. The let
ter suggested to the voter that as there
was a warrant out for his arrest he be
accompanied to the polls by a friend, who
would give a ball bond. These letters
were en plain paper, without a printed
letterhead or other evidence of their
origin. They were mailed on Sunday and
delivered th's morning. Many of the re
cipients hastened to Republican national
or county headquarters to ask what the
warning meant. Republican officials knew
nothing about the letters. A search
through the city director}* failed to dis
close the "National Protective Associa
tion." These letters were characterized
by Republicans as evidence of "contempt
ible and cowardly Tammany roorbacks."
All Republicans who came to mane in
quiry were told to go and vote and were
assured of protection. No warrants such
as are described in the letters are out.
Republican lawyers and bondsmen will be
at each of the Magistrates' courts to de
fend Republican voters and also at the
county courthouse to obtain the necessary
writs permitting voters to vote who are
improperly prevented from so doing.

DEYERY DECIDES TO
RESCIND HIS ORDER
LINCOLN. Neb.. Nov. 5.â With j
the exception of seven speeches ;
to be made at Omaha to 1 night. j
William J. Bryan completed h>s j
Presidential campaign tour of i
this State with * speech In this, his home j
city, at G o'clock this evening. He re- ;
turned here at that time from a twelve- j
hour tour of the Interior of the State, ar.d j
proceeding immediately to the People's j
square delivered a speech of about thirty
minutes 1 duration to his townspeople.
Mr. Bryan seemed entirely satisfied
with the audiences that greeted him at
various points of his own State. Many of
the place.? at which he spoke are Repub
lican in sentiment, but in all cases the
crowds were :arge in proportion to the |
population, and in most of them there was |
a high degree of friendly interest man:- j
fest. :
Outside of Lincoln and Omaha. Hastings |
supplied the largest audience cf the day. |
At that place Mr. Bryan spoke for a half- j
hour, and in connection with his discus- j
sion of the Boer question Mr. Bryan re
ferred to the election of John Burns to
Parliament. On that point Mr. Bryan
said: \
"They have recently had an election In Â¦
England, and John Burns, who represents j
a labor district, was re-elected there, ami |
he made his fight against the imperialism j
that was manifesting itself in South Af- j
rlca. and I want to read you an extract
from his speech, for when our man Kent !
from* this State, one of the two delegates \
from the Unltei States to the Labor Con- I
gtess in England, went over there he |
found that the tirst thing the laboring t
men of England did was to pass a resolu- j
tion condemning the Boer war. They say
we ought not to say anything against the !
Filipino war. They would deny to us the
right of free speech that they even
have in England, and say that in free
America we shall not raise our voice
against Injustice and the violation of the
constitution. And yet the laboring men
of England passed their resolution de
nouncing the Boer war. and John Burns
was re-elected over there after making a
speech, an extract from which I will
read. Speaking- of the programme of what
he declared the new imperialist, he said:
" 'In a word, the new Imperialist prac
tices and gets the people's army and jiavy
to enforce his sordid ideals. A nation
which countenances that is doomed; a
people that connives at it is already half
way on the road to slavery. A working
class that does not resist It is destined to
be taught the sharpest lesson they ever
received."
"That is what John Burns of England
said to the British people In his contest
for re-election; when he made the issue
on the Boer war. And yet In this country
you will find Republicans who want to do
exactly In the Orient what England is do-
Ing in South Africa. To-day the United
States ia not able to sympathize with the
others, for if the Republican party were
to announce to thÂ« Government a resolu
tion of sympathy Srtth the Boers. Eng
land through Parliament, would ask what
was the matter with the Filipinos. The
Republican party to-day Is doing just
what the Tories and the Conservatives of
England are doing over there. "We are
waging a war of conquest, a war for the
purchase of trade: and if you will read
what was said by Senator Hawley In the
United States Senate you will flnd that
they want an army In this country to co
erce laboring men. and you will flnd that
Mr. Hull, the chairman of the House
Military Committee. In a letter in which
he advised and recommended accepting a
site for a fort near Des Molnes. said:
" *lt has been the policy of the depart
ment to concentrate the troops near the
large centers of population, where many
railway lines converge and allow of them
being rapidly transported to points of
threatened disturbance.'
"That has been the policy in recent
years, and yet when I said the other day
that one purpose of the large army was
to coerce laboring men and have the army
near large centers to suppress strikes Mr.
Roosevelt said that I was stirring up class
prejudice; and yet I was using the very I
language that was used by the chairman
of the Military Committee of the House,
a Republican from Des Moines. Iowa, and
I was only telling in the same language
what Mr. Hawley. as Senator, stated in
the United States Senate a year ago."'
Mr. Bryan made brief speeches at the
towns of Aurora. York and Seward. ad
dressing large and enthusiastic audience*
at each of these places. His remarks at
c.ich place were a summary of his prÂ»
\iuus speeches, and he touched upon a!',
tne principal questions of the campaign.
He took occasion at each place to oh*ervÂ»
the importance of electing the whole
Democratic ticket and of sendin" a fu
p-onist to the Senate in place of Senator
Thurston.
Mr. Bryan was met at the Burlington
station by a large throng of people upon
his arrival here at Â»> o'clock to-nijrh? from
the Interior of thÂ» State. He ppnke fnÂ»m
a temporary stand in PosrnfTice s>iuarÂ»*
and in the main devoted himself to thf

evidently well received. The meeting was
a purely informal one. and there was n >
chairman present to preside over it. In
Intrortucing his Â«pee< h Mr. Bryan referral
to this fact, and also referred' to th*r fact
that this was a homecoming for himself.
He said during his address:

The body of the speech -wasi devoted to
a discussion of the trusts and the ques

the subject of pensions. On all of these
subjects the speech followed familiar
lines. In conclusion Mr. Bryan said:
"Now. my friends, let me thank you

gressional and State nominees . will be
elected by majorities ranging from 1500 to

of election finds both parties still stoutly
claiming that they will carry the State.
Conservative Republicans estimate that

and State tickets and a comfortable ma
jority on joint ballot in the next Legisla
ture. :

interest Is being shown In to-morrow's
election and indications are that a light
vote will be polled throughout the State.
The Democratic managers claim that.
Bryan's majority will be anywhere from
175,000 to 200,000. and that the only fight Is
in the Tenth Congressional- District, where
the result will be close. The Republicans
claim Jones', election In the Tenth.

in the State and think the old majority
will be maintained as the Democratic
registration has not been reduced. . while

they have many volunteers .who will

State of Mississippi to-morrow the chair
men of the executive committees are ex

RALEIGH, N. C:, Nov. 5.-The Demo
crats closed their campaign to-day witri
meetings in every Congressional District.
They are confident of victory in all but
the Eighth and Ninth districts. These

Democrats are hopeful of cutting down
McKinley's 38.000 plurality of four years

mated that the vote of the State will be
more than 10 per cent short on account of
the registration law failing to provide for
the opening of the books after the State

BIG VOTE IN WASHINGTON.
SEATTLE, Nov. 5.â Both the Repub-
Ihan and Democratic State committees
announced to-night that all preliminary
work for to-morrow's election in this
State has been completed. Both seem
confident of success. The registration
hero Is the largest In the history of the
country. Every effort to get early re
turns has been made, but owing to the
heavy bailot. It is feared that the exact
account will be delayed until late Wednes
day morning.
RALLIES IN MONTANA.
HELKXA. Mont., Nov. 5.â Both parties
held closing rallies in this city to-night.
The Republican speaker was Senator
Thomas 11. Carter, who held forth at the
Auditorium. Ex-Governor Joseph K.
Toole. fusion nominee for Governor, spoke
nt Mings" Opera-house. Both houses were
crowded to the utmost capacity and
there was enthusiasm running over.
There were torchlight processions before
the meetings. Both processions were lib
erally supplied with fireworks and kept
the skies flaring. The Democrats had
more men in line than the Republicans.
There-were meetings at Butte and a fevÂ»
other places, but for the most part the
campaign ended Saturday night. There
is no reason to change the forecast sent
out then.
AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
WASHINGTON*. Nov. 5.â Intense inter
est in the result of to-morrow's election
Is manifest in Washington. Never be
fore have the preparations for receiving
?.nd displaying the election returns been
more complete than for to-morrow night.
The newspapers, clubs, stock brokers*
offices and private individuals have made
elaborate preparations for the election.
The President and the greater portion of
his Cabinet are out of the city. Secretary
Hay. bf-ing a resident of the District of
Columbia, has no vote, and he, with Sec
retary Gage and a limited number of In
vited guests, will assemble at the White
House and receive the returns. They
also will be in long-distance telephone
communication with the President and
with the Republican headquarters in Chi
cago and New York. There has been an
exceptionally large exodus of Government
employes' to vote. No restrictions have
been placed on employes because of party
affiliations. Representatives of the Re
publican and Democratic Congressional
committees will be on hand at their re
spective headquarters to receive and
tabulate the returns with particular re
gard to the political complexion of the In
coming House of Representatives.
AS TO ALABAMA.
MONTGOMERY. Ala.. Nov. 5.â There is
not the least excitement over to-morrow's
and reaJly but little interest, ex
orpt in the Seventh Congressional Dis
trict, which both sides claim. However,
Indications point to Democratic success.
The vote In *hf State will b* light, with
about the usual Democratic majority.
NO- DOUBT AS TO GEORGIA.
ATLANTA, Ga.. Nov. 5.â There being no
doubt as to how Georgia will cast her
vote on the general election to-morrow,
the local Democratic clubs are urging the
voters to go to the polls and make Bry
an's majority as large as possible. Vice
Chairman Brown of the State Democratic
executive committee claims that Georgia
will give Bryan a majority of 60,000.
ALL IS WELL IN WISCONSIN.
MILWAUKEE. WiS.. Nov. 5.âIndica
tions point to Republican success
throughout Wisconsin. Even the Demo
cratic press concedes the State to McKin
loy. The Republican State ticket will un
doubtedly be elected. Of the ten Con
gressmen to be elected nine are particu
larly conceded to the Republicans, the
Democrats having a chance in the Second
District.
WILL CARRY NORTH DAKOTA.
KAROO. N. D.. Nov. 5.â Neither com
mittee has any changes to make in its
estimates. McKInley. it Is claimed, will
carry the State, but the Republican State
ticket will get a smaller vote, though ap
parently the State is safely Republican.
An increase of 10.000 or 15,000 votes will
make the majority rather uncertain. A
big fight is being maxle here for members
of the State Senate holding over until the
Senatorial election.
TENNESSEE IN DOUBT.
NASHVILLE. Tenn.. Nov. 5.â Chairman
Fitzpatrlck of the Democratic Committee
*aid to-day: "We have good news from
all over thÂ« State to-day, and I have no
doubt about the result in Tennessee for
either Bryan or McMlllin."
Mr. Brook, acting Republican chairman,
paid: "We expect to elect three Congress
men and to increase our majority in the
I^pislature. -\Ve believe there has been
considerable change over the State for
MeKinley, perhaps enough to give him the
State."
NO CHANGE IN ABKANSAS.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.. Nov. 5.â To-night
the Democratic managers are confident
Bryan will carry Arkansas in to-morrow's
election by a majority almost equaling
that of 1S36. when the figures exceeded 72,
000 on a Democrat and Populist fusion
ticket.
The Republicans give the State to Bry
an, but will not concede over 40,000'plu
rality.
STRUGGLE IN MICHIGAN.
DETROIT. Mich.. Nov. 5.â Both parties
In Michigan are confident of success to
morrow. Mayor Maybury of Detroit.
Democratic candidate for Governor, and
Colonel Bliss of Saginaw, his Republican
opponent, issued signed statements late
to-day. In which each confidently asserts
that he will be elected. Senator James
McMillan In an interview this afternoon
said:
"I feel confident of a preat Republican
victory, both nationally and In this State.
1 predict our majority in Michigan will be
between 70,000 and 75,000."
The Democrats have, jrfven out'no'fig
ures, hut claim that their State ticket will
be elected, and also that they will elect
several Congressmen. Governor Plngree
haw made strenuous efforts to secure the
adoption of the constitutional amendment
permitting the taxation of railroads and
other corporations on the cash value of
their property Instead of specifically upon
their earnings, as at present. He has
mailed circulars to thousands of voters
throughout the State, urging t*ie impor
tance of its adoption.
CLAIMS IN CONNECTICUT.
NEW HAVEN. Conn.. Nov. 5.âObserv
ers who are not Intensely partisan predict
a safe MeKinley margin and a probable
Republican victory on the State ticket.
On the latter point, however, they. are
careful not to express in figures their
opinions.
The two State committees to-day issued
new statements. Each was full of con
fident claims more emphatic than the con
tentions contained in the statements of
last week. The Republicans insist with
Increased figures that a -wholesale victory
for that party is In the air.. The Demo
crats are more combative than . hereto
fore, and in addition to claims of a State
ticket walkover are inclined to take Con-
HAHD FIGHT IN NEVADA.
RENO. Nev., Nov. 5.â The last day of
the campaign in Nevada was marked by
nrtive work on both Fides. On the sur
face the indications are that it will be
very close. The Republicans have made
a hard fight to elect Farrington for Con
press, and the chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee says Farring
ton will be t-Iected by 500 majority. The
Democrats, on the other hand, feel very
confident that they will. carry the State
as in 1K<6. for Bryan and return Newlands
to Congress. Every fndlcatlon points to
fair weather and a large vote being polled
to-morrow, j .Â»,Â¦. _Â¦ < .^
OREGON IN EIGHT COLUMN.
PORTLAND. Nov. 5.â Oregon will vote
for Presidential Electors only to-morrow
and the indications are that MeKinley
will have a plurality of at least 10.000.
The Democrats concede that the State
will give the Republican ticket . a ma
jority. Politicians have been - active
all day assisting unregistered voters In

made no changes in their estimates as
given on Saturday night. A few. speeches
were made to-night in the principal cities

J â¢Â¦: â of tlse i-vrnccritie National Com- J '
mitt?e pave out the following on the out- j
look on the eve of rlec'ion:
"I have no doubt that the result of the i
ballot to-morrow v.ill be the triumphant i i
rlfr'itn of Brysn and Stevenson. The 1 '
Democratic party has appealed :n this â¢
campaign to the reason and conscience of j ,
the p^opi*. while the Republicans have J â¢
appealed to pa.~<on and prejudice. In the i 1
grest forum of public opinion I have no j
doubt the Democratic party has won in !
this, the greatf-Ft of its national political j
Mrupelrs. Four years .-igo the Democratic i
party was defidentln oiganization._ where- i
as now H is perfectly organized and more
efficient than it has been in any campaign, i
The rational committee has been in tou'h i
with every part of the country an-i is fa- j

While the campaign fund has not been en- '
ri<hed by th â¢â¢ contribution? of great j
trusts, it has received the patriotic mites j
of the girat working o!a5ses in sufficient
quantities to defray the expenses of the j
campaign, whi^h is more satisfactory
than if it had he*>n otherwise. The coun- j
try is now aroused as it has n^ver boen '
before since the great civil war. and the ,
result ran be nothing les? than the tri- |
umphant electit n of the national Demo- ; I
critic ticket." '
McKINLEY'S STATE SAFE.
CINCINNATI. Nov. 5.â AH sp^cu'.atinn
to-night Is on the question of Democratic I
pains in :he cities and Republican gains';
in the n-ral districts of Ohio. John R. ,
McLean is here trying to reduce the Re- |

Bryan will carry Ohio "unUss prevented i

issuing rotioos and warnings about the j
use of pen<-iis and al! ports of fraud. There

MINNESOTA IS REPUBLICAN.
. ST. PAT.'L. Nov. n.â This year's cam
l";.'i?n in Illnnesota has been closely con
u-stM su nearly all points, although the
rnort work has been done by the D^mo
rrats on the Governorship and the three
Railroad Â«"ommlssionerships. The election
of the MeKinley Electors sr-ems assured,
but the Democratic committee is express
ing a belief in the possibility of Bryan
carrying the State without actually claim
ing it. The Republicans place the Mc
.Kinley plurality at from 50.000 to 75.000.
The re-election of Governor John Kind j
OTCT Captain Vf.ii Sant is claimed by the
Democrat? by over Â£;1/WO. which is the tie- Â¦
tire given by the Republicans in their
claim for Van Fant. The result for Gov
ernor will undoubtedly be close. The Re

State ti^k^t down to Railway Commis
sioner, which the Democrats have put up
a ftiff fight for. making the result doubt

PORTLAND, Me., Nov. S.-The condi

since Saturday evening, and there is no
reason to . change the estimate of the
probable Republican plurality of &.000 in
the State. This Is about the average
figure and it is pretty, generally conceded
NO CHANGE 'IN MAINE.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 5.â There
is a large registration throughout the
State and Bryan's majority Is expected
to be larger than In 189ftâ 21.000â on account
of the capital removal question causing
a larger registration this year. The can
didate for Governor, is William S. Jen

FORECAST FOR FLORIDA.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Nov. 5.-Thc
Democrats have no opposition in South
Carolina, and the campaign was feature
less. The .contests- Jn the Congressional"
districts were settled several weeks ago
by primaries. The electoral vote seems
certain for Bryan, but his majority is not
expected to be large.
SOUTH CAROLINA'S VOTE.
CONCORD. N. H.. Nov. 5.-The Demo
cratic managers concede about -what the

and Jordan, the Republican candidate for
Governor, 15,000.
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Chairman William B. Gourley of the
Democratic State Committee said: "We
are not giving out any figures, but I claim
Bryan will carry New Jersey by a safe
margin. I aro^confldent the Democrats
will carry four of the eight Congressional
districts."
Chairman Franklin Murphy of the Re
publican State Committee to-day Bald:
"The Republican party seems to be in
very good condition all over the State and
during my experience I have never seen
the county organization so apparently sat
isfied with the way the campaign has been
handled. Our majority, I believe, will be
at least 45.000."
NEW YORK, Nov. 5.-There has been
no change in the political situation in
New Jersey to-night. The Republicans
are confident of success, but the Demo
crats claim that if the members of their
party who remained away from the polls
four years ago turn out t6-morrow the
State will go for Bryan. The Increase Jn
registration, the Republicans claim is due
to the normal growth of the voting peo
ple. The Democrats, however, claim that
the Increase shows that those Democrats
who remained away from the polls four
years ago expect to vote to-morrow. The
great fight In the State will be for the
legislative officers. The eight Senators to'
be elected will have a vote next year for
a successor to Senator "William J. Sewell.
whose term expinÂ»Â«_at that time. Under
ordinary circumstances the Democrats
would hope to elect seven of the eight
Senators, because the counties from which
they are, to be elected are Democratic,
but it being a Presidential year the Re
publicans claim the big vote that will' be
polled for MeKinley will enable them to
pull through five of the Senators, which
would give them such a majority In the
Senate that only a landslide next year
would prevent them having a majority
on Joint ballot.
ST. LOUIS. Nov. 5.â The Democrats ex
press the utmost confidence in their abil
ity to elect Congressman Alexander M
Dockery Governor by a plurality of 30 000
and more and of giving; Bryan a majority
of from 40,000 to 60.000. The Republicans
are equally boastful. Many are of the
opinion that the counting of the ballot*
on Tuesday night will find MeKinley with
a slight majority over Bryan and Ratlroad
Commissioner Joseph Flory entitled to
take his seat in the Governor's chair. Oth
ers not as sanguine of success as their
fellows console themselves with the
thought that the Democratic national
ticket will show a greatly reduced plural
ity. It Is generally conceded by the mem
bers of both parties that to-morrow's vote
will show surprising changes.
There Is no change in the Congressional
situation. The Democrats say that they
will elect thirteen out of the fifteen Con
gressmen to be voted for, and the Republi
cans expect to elect five out of the fifteen
a gain of two.

NEBRASKA FOR McKINLEY.
OMAHA, Nov. 5.â The Republican State
Committee is still claiming. the State b>
5000 plurality for MeKinley; but this Is
placed against the positive assertion by
vhairman Hall of the Democratic Corn

CHICAGO. Nov. 5.â Senator Hanna j

the depot to extend a welcome. Accom

said:
"My friends, save your enthusiasm for
to-morrow night, for then you will have
plenty of opportunity to give It full play.

important elections that has ever been
held in the United States. It is second to
none for the effect it will have

part of Chicago. To-morrow it will be
in your power, to decide this great ques
tion of whether we are to continue pros

has stood by you. (Applause.)
"Let me present a picture. On one side

HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Nov.
5.â Secretary Root found it nec
essary some days ago to Issue
special instructions to Major
General MacArthur, Governor General of
the Philippines, regarding the conduct of
the campaign in Luzon. These Instruc
tions were due to dissatisfaction caused
by. the successful operation of the Fili
pinos against the American forces. Gen
eral MacArthur's policy was to scatter
the troops over a wide range of territory,
carrying out in this way the policy
initiated by General Otis. The Filipinos
assembled in sufficiently large numbers to
make vigorous assaults upon the Amer
ican garrisons and for some weeks there
were numerous engagements. In which
the Americans failed to gain an advan
tage, and in some, instances were forced
to retreat and suffered distinct reverses.
The War Department Is understood to
have directed General MacArthur to take
measures to prevent further successful
operations by collecting his troops in suf
ficient force to destroy any bands with
Â¦which they might come in conflict. No
important insurgent operations have oc
curred for some days and it is believed
the execution of the department's instruc
tions is responsible for this satisfactory
condition. General MacArthur's friends
say he is handicapped by the absence of
troops in China, but information reached
the War Department to-d^v that the
Fourteenth Infantry had left Taku on
Saturday for Manila. Other regiments
will follow and General MacArthur will
have about 70,000 men with whom to in
augurate the campaign against the ln
surgents. The withdrawal of volunteers
will commence next month if McKinley
be re-elected or this month In case Bryan
Is successful.
Adjutant General Corbin received to-day
from Judge Taft. president of the Philip
pine Commission, a dispatch forwarding
the message from Senor Buencamlno, for
merly Secretary of Foreign Affairs in
Aguinaldo'9 Cabinet, declaring his loyalty
to the United States. The message was
telegraphed to the President, who. If hÂ»
thinks proper, will make It public. It Is
understood that Senor Buencamino un
reservedly accepts American sovereignty
and submits a proposition to organize a

as laid bare by the sensational evidence
in the second trial of Sternberg, the rich
Berlin banker, accused of an offense
against morality, and the peculiar manner
in which the case itself was prepared and
has been handled, are the talk of the
whole city. In view of the clear signs of
corruption and lack of discipline brought
out by the proceedings, it was resolved
to-day at a conference between Count von
Billow, the Imperial Chancellor, and
Baron von Rheinhaben Prussian Minister
of the Interior, to overhaul the Berlin po
lice department.
Immediately a/ter the conference Baron
Rheinhaben ordered a sharp investigation,
without fear or favor. It is expected that
a large number of the criminal police
will be disciplined and that about a score
will be dismissed, among them the chief
of the criminal police, Von Meerscheidt
Huellessem, who was strongly compro
mised by the trial.
Altogether no fewer than seventy mem
bers of the criminal police are said to be
Implicated in the Sternberg case. The
press, without distinction of party, sternly
demands thorough reforms. In addition to
the two Commissioners against whom
damaging evidence has been offered, it Is
rumored that a number of others ara in

received by the head men with the as
surance .that they were not enemies of
the foreigners. As proof of thia assertion
they pointed to a <hastly rov of forty
human heads impaled over the gat*
These, they said, were the heads of
Boxers who had been executed. These
recent events are construed as indicating
that Li Hung Chang'* edict is being
obeyed and with passive submission to
Invasion little can be accomplished, in
the opinion of military men, by further
expeditions, unless all' the villages are
destroyed. The latter resort, it is said,
is not likely to be carried out. While
In the vicinity of Peking small commands

CALL. BTTREAT.-, WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov.
5â It has been Intimated that be
fore entering into their agree
ment Great Britain and Germany
pounded Russia, but the best diplomatic
information the officials can obtain indi
cates that this is not true. It is learned
that Russia had an idea that Secretary
Ilay was approached by the British Gov
ernment and took steps to ascertain if
this- were so. There is authority for the
statement that Secretary Hay knew noth
ing about the Anglo-German pact until it
was made public by the London and Ber
lin authorities. A well informed diplomat
expressed the opinion to-day that *Â»,â
Anglo-German agreement was the most
disturbing clement in the International
situation. He pointed out that all nations
I ..1 rt*Â»MnrÂ«Â»fi In fa Vf.r /-if tVÂ»Â«i
"open door" and the maintenance of
China's Integrity. The effect of the agree
ment, in the opinion of this diplomat,
has been to make Russia and . France
more suspicious than before of the pur
ports of Great Britain and Germany, it
being known that the former desires to
acquire the Yaiigtse-ICiang Valley, both
because of its tra.de and the fact that It is
the road which connects India and the
China Sea, while the latter's aim, accord
ing to the diplomat, still has territorial
Â«Kfi:r;in<Jii:t'nient In view.
Secretary Hay Is hopeful that negotia
tions looking to permanent peace will be
satisfactorily concluded and there is rea
son to l>elleve that he has not abandoned
his purpose to obtain from the powers a
denrjonhtraUon of their intention not to
*-cize Chinese territory. The Secretary's
feeling is probably based upon the pro-
Ci-ess being made at Peking. Minister
Conger has reported that the punishment
question has practically been disposed of.
Vuan is to be banished and not beheaded.
Thla seems to l>e definitely determined.
The disposition of the Empress Dowager
has not entered into the discussion, and it
Is clear that she will receive personal pro
tection, though *he will be excluded from
â¢ia.rticipatloii In the affairs of the Imperial
Government. The Indemnity question Is
being discussed, but no propositions have
yet been submitted by the negotiators
to the several Governments regarding the
amount to be demanded or the method of
collection. Secretary Hay has not been
â¢iFked to assent to the proposition report
c-d to bava beon made to the powers by
the Ministers In Peking that the Chinese
Government be asked to issue an edict
forbidding membership in the Boxer So
ciety under penalty of death, and that the

PENNSYLVANIA SAPEjW
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 5.â Very* I little
interest is manifested relative to the vote
of Pennsylvania in the Presidential con
test, as a big Republican majority is con
ceded even by the Democratic leaders.
Kour vears ago McKinley's plurality in
the State was 295,072, of which plurality
Philadelphia furnished 113,130. The high
est previous plurality in tne State for a
Presidential candidate was 135.53S for
Grant In 1S72. In 1SP2 Harrison's plurality
was 63,747. McKinley's plurality of four
years ago will no doubt be considerably
reduced through the return to their party
of many Democrats who opposed Bryan
in 1S36, and it Is thought also that McKin
ley's vote will be reduced to some extent
on account of the fierce contest of the
Quay and anti-Quay Republicans to ob
tain control of the next Legislature. The
anti-Quay men In some sections have in
dorsed the Democratic legislative candi
dates, and it Is believed this will, in those
sections, have some effect against th<
head of the Republican ticket. There is.
however, every Indication of a considera
ble reduction in McKinley's figures of four
years ago.
THE BATTLE IN IDAHO.
BOISE. Idaho, Nov. 5.â The night before
the battle of the ballots finds the parties
lined up/ both manifesting great confi
dence. The day has been given over to
street-corner discussion, and much bet
ting has , been done. There seems to be
much more money than for many yfars
for this purpose, and even bets are freely
made on /the result of the 8ta.te. The
most uncertain element in the situation
appears to be Shoshone County, the scene
of riots cf 1S99. While the Republicans
are assured they will carry the' county
they have no poll of It; it Is one of two
counties which have not been polled by
them. There are 5000 votes In Shoshone.
HOT FIGHT IN ILLINOIS.
BALTIMORE, Nov. 5.â The leaders of
CHICAGO, Nov. 5.â Both parties are
confident of the result of to-morrow's vot
ing. Never have the plans of campaign
managers in this State been more com
prehensive or laid with greater care, and
no Presidential campaign since that of
Blaine and Cleveland in 18S4 has been
fought out with greater energy In this
State than the one that has Just closed.
Both Democratic and Republican man
agers have made every preparation
against unlawful action at the polls by
their opponents, but there has been les*
talk of (such things this year than in prior
campaigns. The chances are that there
will be no more fraudulent voting than
occurs at every city election
A very full vote will be polled in the
State at large and especially In Chicago
and Cook County. The fight here has been
of the warmest description and every ef
fort will be made to bring the full voting
strength of both parties into the field. The
Republicans in particular are elated at
the prospect of fine weather to-morrow
and saÂ«y Jt means their sure success. The
Democratic managers declare that weath
er will make no difference and that, rain
or shine, the election is certain to result
in a sweeping Democratic triumph.
STRUGGLE IN MARYLAND.
both political parties profess to be con
fident of victory and both sides are claim
ing the State by pronounced majorities.
Before leaving for his home in Hartford
County, to-night. Chairman Murray Van
diver of the Democratic State Central
Committee, said: "I have no hesitancy in
claiming that we will carry the State by
from 50-jO to 10.000 majority, and that both
city and county will contribute to that
end. We will not only carry the State for
Bryan, but will elect four Congressmen
sure, and it would not surprise me in the
least if Major Little should defeat Pearre
in the Sixth District."
Secretary William F. Porter of the city
Democratic committee, supplemented Mr.
Vandiver's statement by adding: "We
have made a careful poll of the city by
men experienced in the work, who made
polls in tne two previous campaigns. I
have the utmost confidence in the accur
acy of the latest poll and will say that
the outlook is bright and that the city
will go Democratic by a substantial ma
jority. 1 will not give any figures, but am
confident of a favorable result."
Chairman Goldborough of the Republi
can State Committee said to-day that he
looks for even a larger majority than the
11.000 which he gave last night as his esti
mate, and insisted that Maryland's Con
gressional delegation will be entirely Re
publican.
IN MASSACHUSETTS.
BOSTON, Nov. 5. â Although the major
ity of the voters in Massachusetts will
cast their ballots to-morrow in favor of
McKinley, the size of this majority and
how many Republican Congressmen will
be elected is a matter upon which the
party leaders fall to agree. The Repub
licans are confident that McKinley will
have at least 100,000 votes more than
Bryan, while the Democrats believe that
50,000 will be nearer the mark". Four
years' ago the Republicans carried the
State by 175,000 plurality, but dissensions
in the Democratic ranks cut a wide swath
In the ordinary party vote. This year
this disaffection has almost entirely dis
appeared. It Is believed that Governor
Crane will run ahead of the national
ticket, especially in the western part of
the State. As usual, the Republican State
candidates will be elected, with the ex
ception, perhaps, of Auditor, as there is
a strong sentiment, especially among the
Grand Army Veterans, against Henry IS.
Turner of Maiden, who defeated the in
cumbent, John W. Klmball of Fitchburg,
in the convention.
It will not be surprising, therefore, if
William O. Merrill, the Prohibitionist
candidate for the office, is elected.
As for the Congressmen, nine Republi
cans and one Democrat are sure of elec
tion, while in two other districts indica
tions favor the Republicans. Very little
change is expected in the Legislature,
which has been always strongly Republi
can
12*- NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Nov. 5. â The most Inter
esting development in New York on the
eve of election is the indictment found by
the local Grand Jury against Chief of
Police William S. Devery. on the charge
of interfering with the work of Superin
tendent of State Elections McCuliagh.
Chief Devery's ball was fixed and ar
rangements were made for hearing the
case the day after election. The indict
ment has created a great deal of excite
ment in political circles. The points ln-
volved appear to hinge on the rights of
men to swear in their votes when chal
lenged by any deputies of the State
Superintendent of Elections. The legal
aspects of the case are interesting to Re
publicans and Democrats alike, for it is
feared that a clash may occur at the
polls to-morrow between the 800 Dolice
men and the 800 deputies. At the politi
cal headquarters, at the office of the
Chief of Police and at the Democratic
Club, the consensus of opinion seemed to
be that the election would prove a quiet
one despite the differences of opinion be
tween the Chief of Police and the State
Superintendent.
Everywhere confidence is expressed
that a full vote will be polled and Repub
licans and Democrats alike agree that
more than 600,000 citizens in Greater New
York will vote to-morrow.
Indications are that the vote in the city
will be at least 65,000 larger than ever be
fore in the history of Greater New York.
Generally speaking, the Republicans
concede that Bryan will carry Greater
Xew York. On the other hand Democrats
admit that McKinley will carry the State
if Greater New York is excluded. The
differences of opinion arise on the ques
tion of the pluralities that the Democrats
are conceded in the metropolis and the
Republicans are conceded In the up-State
districts.
Richard Croker claims that Bryan will
carry Greater New York by between 80,
000 and 'J0.O0O.
As a general thing. Republican leaders
will not admit that the borough of Man
hattan will be carried for Bryan by more
.than 30.000 plurality. Both sides claim the
borough of Brooklvn, the Republicans by
12,0)0, the Democrats by SOOO. The popu
lation In the boroughs bf the Bronx,
Queens and Richmond is relatively small.
Democrats and Republicans claim all
three boroughs, but the Democrats usual
ly carry Queens and Richmond. As for
the Bronx, the Increase In population ow
ing to the up-town movement has been so
great that all estimates are worthless, the
population in some districts having dou
bled. It will probably give a decisive ma
jority either way.
Democrats are inclined to concede the
State outside of Greater Xew York to Me
ICinley by 50,000. This is 100.000 less than
the Republicans allow McKinley In the
fame territory. Chairman Odell, Repub
lican candidate for Governor, is at his
home in Xewburg. He will receive re
turr.s at his home and will not return here
until Wednesday. Before leaving he said
that he had nothing to add to his state
ment that McKinley would carry New
York State by 100,000, Greater Xew York
Included.
There was very little betting done to
night on the election. The odds dropped
to ZVz to 1 on McKinley toward the latter
part of the evening and remained there.
DELAWARE FOR McKINLEY.
WILMINGTON, Del.. Nov. 5.â The out
look to-night is that the Republicans will
carry Delaware for McKInley and the
State ticket by a majority of about 1500.
Republican State Chairman Churchman
claims the State by "000 majority. The
Legislature, which Â¦will elect two United
States Senators, is In doubt, however,
both parties claiming It.
Democratic State Chairman Saulsbury
claims that the State will give Bryan the
electoral vote, and that -the Legislature
will have a Democratic majority.
audience and he said in part:
"We have made an honest, open fight
for what we believe to be right in Ameri
can politics and our responsibility ends
when the voter assumes tne responsibility
of deciding upon the questions, and here
to-night before this magnincent audience,
I want to refute the charges that the
Democratic party Is trying io array class
against class. Republicans say we are
preaching a gospel of hate. I deny it. We
preach a gospel of love. We are trying to
uring people together; we are not trying
to drive tnem apart. But you cannot
draw people together unless you have Jus
tice as the basis for tneir friendship; and
when Republicans tell you that we are
trying to array one class against another.
1 want you to know that tne Republican
party has arrayed every trust magnate
apamst the Democratic party and we ask
the victims to come with us. The trust
magnate stands high in society, despite
his crimes, and the Republican party dare
not attaiK him."
The last speech of the night and of the
campaign was made betore the Good
Shepherd Fair in the Schlltz Roof Gar
den, and it did rot begin until almost
half-past 12.
He spoke of the importance of the cam
paign just closed, and his speech was
largely an appeal for non-partisan action
in the election. He concluded at 12:45
o'clock Tuesday morning, and when he
left the platfcrm. after nineteen hours of
consecutive work and an exceptionally
long and arduous campaign, his voice was
still strong and clear and his physical con
auion first class.
Mr. IJryan spent the remainder of the
night after concluding his speeches in
this city, intending to return to Lincoln
early to-morrow morning to cast his vote.
Following are the closing words of Mr.
Bryan's last speech to-night:
"We have submitted these questions; we
have dene our best. Now is the time for
the American people to act. and all that
I can ask of the American voter is to act
to morrow at the polls just as he would
II he knew that the destiny of liis nation
was hanging upon a single vote. It is a
terrible responsibility, my friends: it is a
terrible responsibility to be a citizen at a
time like this, for the vote of a citizen is
potent to determine the destiny of this na
tion, and by determining the destiny of
this nation the vote of the citizen will de
termine the destiny of other nations. If
liberty triumphs here it will triumph else
where; If it dies here It dies everywhere,
and therefore when you are fighting thla
battle you are fighting- it not for America
alor.e: you are lighting it lor the world,
and the world looks on while our battle is
fought upon this hilltop. I beg you to rec
ognize the responsibility of citizenship
and vote as you would if you knew that
your vote Â¦would determine the contest."
He spoke at the theater for twenty mln
utes. "A Democrat." he caid, '"told me
a few days ago that he had been Invited
to come to New York right after the elec
tion In case of Republican success and
help form a. trust and he asked what he
f hould do In case I was elected. He was
told he need not come, they would not
organize."
Mr. Bryan made his next speech in
Creighton Theater.- He had a splendid
"You don't know how consoling it is to

"1 am glad to know that those who were
born in foreign lands and. came here to
enjoy liberty under the American tlag are
this 'year ready to vote to preserve that
liberty which they came to enjoy."
He promised that if elected the constitu
tion should be so amended as to permit
the election of Senators by direct vote of
the people.
The fifth place of meeting was in a tent
at the corner of Fifteenth street and Capi
tal avenue. There he had the largest au
dience of the evening and also the most
enthusiastic one. He spoke at this place
at greater length than at any previous
meeting, dealing with the general Issues
<jf the campaign, and again appealed to
his hearers for active Â¦work at the polls
and for the uniform support of the entfru
ticket.
The sixth meeting of the night was held
at Washington Hall. There he spoke for
only a few minutes- He appealed for a
bigger majority In the State than in 1SSG.
It was half-past 11 o'clock when Mr.
Bryan appeared at the Boyd Theater ani
he "still had two more meetings before
closing.
As he came upon the stage some one
ehouted. "Bryan s all right." Taking his
cue from this ejaculation. Mr. Bryan said:
Another short drive brought the national
candidate to Metz Hall, where he address
ed a large audience composed almost en
tirely of Bohemians. He was presented
â¢with a bouquet of roses by a little Bohe
mian girl. Responding, Mr. Bryan said:
After this open-air meeting Mr. Bryan
was rushed across the city for two or
three miles to Damman's Hall, where he
received another cordial welcome. His
ppeech was devoted almost exclusively to
an appeal for attention to the election to
morrow.

The second meeting was held in the

his supporters to go early to the polls.

that Mr. Bryan has announced
his purpose of never again be

believed, though it cannot be confirmed.
It is said the statement was made to
Chairman Martin of the Democratic State
Central Committee on the occasion of
Bryan's last visit to the State.
Mr. Martin was speaking of the gains
the Democrats expected to make, and Mr.
Bryan was asking questions as to cer

He spoke of the apparent enthusiasm of

tained for some time owing to the efforts
of the Russians to keep th.em as Quiet as
possible. "
For some time past Russians have been
jealous of the fishing privileges along the
Siberian, coast, their object being to con
serve them for the exclusive use of Rus
sian subjects. Their dislike for Japanese
llshermen has been heightened by the
fact that the latter obtained the best
fishing rights off the coast of Korea,
where the Russians were outmaneuvered
a year ago. The Korean fisheries have
not turned out' as well this year as usual,
which fact led the Japanese to cruise
further northward Into Siberian waters.
There they were unexpectedly surround
ed by several Russian gunboats and
taken Into port as prizes. Their boats
and equipment were confiscated and the
fishermen nut into jail.
Last summer sixty-seven Japanese fish
ermen were seized by the Russian author
ities for alleged trespassing In Bering
Sea. Forty-nine of them have reached
Nagasaki after spending nearly three
months In Siberian prisons. They tell
sickening stories of Russian cruelty and
their emaciated appearance proves that
they suffered terribly. When first arrest
ed they were dragged Into wet. cold cells,
partly underground, and left there two
days without food or drink. It was weeks
before they were allowed to notify their
friends of their predicament. They claim
that heavy winds and ocean currents
drove them to the Siberian shore. Six
teen of their companions are still In
prison.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6.â Herman Sil
ver, president of the City CouncH, to-day
introduced a resolution, which was adopt
ed, instructing the City Attorney to at
once institute legal proceedings for the
purpose of determining the legality of the
city's $2,090,000 issue of Water works bonds.
Mayor Eaton to-day sent a communica
tion to the City Council recommending
an appropriation of upward of $192,000 for
the construction of head works and a
altering plant which can be used in con
nection with the present water works sys
tem, if the city acquire it, or with a new
plant if the city decide to construct one.
SomÂ© two years ago when it was voted
to issue $2,090,000 of bonds for the purchase
of the existing water works system, or
the construction of an independent one
by the city, provision was made in the
tax levy for money with which to pay
the interest on the bonds and- to provide
a sinking fund. The legality of the bonds
was called Into question and has not yet
been decided, so none of the .bonds have
been sold and the $192,000 referred to rep
resents the accumulation resulting from
the non-use- of the interest money and

TEN YEARS IN SAN
QDENTIN FOR KING
Novel Point Raised by Counsel for
Church's Slayer in Arguing
Motion for a New-
Trial.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 5.â J. E. King was
to-day sentenced to serve a term of ten
years in San Quentin prison. Last week
King, who Is accused of the murder of S.
H. Church at Two Rock In July, was tried
for murder. The jury returned a verdict
finding him guilty of manslaughter. When
brought into court this morning he was
accompanied by his wife, who has scarce
ly left his side since he was arrested. At
torney Lennon for the defense made a mo
tion for a new trial. One of the errors as
signed as a reason for a new trial was
that the court had admitted Church's
deathbed declaration. Church being an
atheist this declaration should not have
been admitted, counsel contended. Mr.
Lennon said that where a man did not be
lieve In a hereafter his final declaration
did not come within the theory of the
law that a man about to die would not
ko Into the presence of his Maker with a
lie on his lips.
Judge Angellottl denied the motion for a
new trial, and defendant's counsel then
reviewed the case at length and asked the
court to be lenient with the prisoner.
Judge Angellotti sentenced King to ten
years In San Quentin. King, whose cool
ness heretofore had caused court specta
tors to marvel, broke down and wept. His
wife threw her arms about his neck and
tried to offer him some, comfort. With
good behavior King will have to serve
about eix years and seven months.

tobacco and whisky and left.
Cattlemen passing the stations later in
day released the captives. The old man
at Gibsons was nearly dead from thirst
and exhaustion from the efforts to free
himself.
A posse of cattlemen was hastily or
ganized and started on the trail and â¢ a
message was sent to Prescott for aid.
Sheriff Munds dispatched another posse
of deputies and volunteers and they
struck the trail late at ni^ht. The young
robbers took a road leading to the foot
hills of the Bradshaw range and the two

the effort to locate them.
Further alonp on the trail the youth

DEATH CLOSES THE CAREER OF
JUDGE CATLIN OF SACRAMENTO
Bitter Denunciation of the Los An
geleno Who Preferred Charges of
Immorality Which He Could
Not Prove.
Sp*elaj Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. . 5.â Judge Fitz
gerald to-day awarded a decree of divorce
to Mr?. Frank Savage and rendered Judg
ment against the husband on his cross
complaint. ' In giving his Mecision "Judge
Fitzgerald .administered a scathing re
buke to young Savage. Mrs. Savage was
granted J4Q amonth alimony. â¢
The charge of improper relations with
Eugene Gannon, which the husband had
made, was, said the court, a most serious
one, and should never be made by any
man unless he had evidence of the most
conclusive character to sustain it. This
allegation Savage ; tried to prove by' his
unsupported evidence alone and he railed
to show a solitary act of wrong-doing,
unless it were that he saw his wife talk
ing and walking with other men on the
streets.
Speaking of Savage having abandoned
his wife, leaving her alone In "the flat on
Main street. Judge Fitzgerald declared,
that she, as an unprotected woman, de
serted by her husband, did just what was
natural for one left in her position. There
was no evidence showing Improper con
duct by Mrs. Savage and Gannon, as the
evidence proved that she never saw him
except in the presence of Mrs. Schappell,
to whom Gannon was engaged to be mar
ried.
"From the evidence In this case," said
the court, "I am convinced that the
charge against this little woman Is as
baseless as it Is false, and I want to state
right here that there has not. been a par
ticle of evidence Introduced upon which
a single suspicion can be found against
this wife. I, therefore, on the crpss
complaint, give judgment to the wife as
against the husband." " -Â¦
The court then took up the complaint,
stating that a decree of divorce was asked
for on the ground of extreme cruelty, and
said:
"It Is almost Incomprehensible to me to
Imagine a human being so brutal and low
as to do this act; one' who Is so cruel
and degraded as to strike any woman,
much less his wife. Yet Savage struck
and kicked her In the presence of com
pany. I want to say that when a woman
comes Into this court seeking a divorce
from a brute who strikes her, she will
get It every time."
Savage sat through the scorching with
a half smile on his face, which was
flushed. When the question of alimony
came up. however, and the court ordered
him to pay his ex-wlfe $40 a month, there
was a visible molsteninp of his eyes and
a vigorous application of a handkerchief.
His attorney protested against this sum,
but Judge Fitzgerald was firm, and, fur
ther, ordered him to pay $70 additional
attorneys fees.

HIS SALOON AND ROBBED

Louis Goss. proprietor of the Market

gomery, was knocked down, chloroformed
and robbed In his place of business by an
unknown man shortly before 2 o'clock this
morning.
The stranger entered Gess' place appar
ently in an intoxicated condition earlier
in the night and bought several rounds of
drinks. He lingered about and as the pro
prietor was about to close the saloon the
man, who was the only other person then
in the place, struck him on the head with
a stick he carried and then applied a
handkerchief saturated with chloroform
to Goss' nose. He took $137 from the al
most unconscious man.
Goss did not entirely lose consciousness
and soon recovered enough to get outside
and notify the policeman on the beat

The construction of Senator Clark's new
railroad between Los Angeles and Salt
Lake City Is to be commenced at once.
Articles of incorporation are to be filed
this week. An order was placed last week
with the Colorado Fuel and Iron Works
for 8000 tons of rails, and the stock Is to
be shipped to Southern California within
thirty days.
A meeting of the projectors of the new
road Is to be held In Salt Lake City this
week, when final arrangements will be
completed. Senator \V. A. Clark will be
president. R. C. Kerens of St. Louis is
booked for vice president and T. B. Glb
bon of Los Angeles will be chief oounsel.
The company will have a capitalization of
$24,000,000.
The reason for having the rails shipped
to Southern California is explained by the
announcement that it is the purpose of
the promoters to first build a line- between
Los Angelese>and San Bernardino. The
8000 tons of ratls that have been ordered
will Just about build a track between
these two places.
Upon the completion of this section of
the line, which, by the way, has already
been surveyed, the surveying -for the re
mainder of the road will have been com
pleted and work will then be started at
Salt Lake City, the plan being to have a
force busy simultaneously at both ends of
the line. Thg, total length of the road will
be about Â«u<) miles, which will require
about 30,000 tons of rails.
It is reported that the United Forward
ing Company and the Fruit Growers' Ex
change, which combined control from 80
to 90 per cent of the oranges and lemons
of the State, have made an arrangement
with Senator ClarK to turn over to his
line all their fruit for a series of years.
About a year ago it was seriously sug
gested that it would be a good Idea for
the orange shippers to hold out an induce
ment of this sort to capitalists who would
build a road between Los Angeles and Salt
Lake, but nothing was done In the matter
at that time. As the fruit growers of
Southern California control shipments for
which the freight amounts to $3,000,000 or
f5.000.000 per year it will be seen that an
agreement with the Clark people along
pome puch line* as mentioned would be no
small inducement for the promoters of the
line.
Two Through Trains Ovir New Route
COAST LINE NEARLY READY.
Dally to Los' Angeles.
Thei Southern Pacific's new coast line
from this city to Los Angeles will be fin
ished next month. William Hood, chief
enjdneer, who is superintending the con
struction of the road, said yesterday that
he hoped to have the "gap" closed by De
cember 1. and then will follow the ballast
ing, upon which an extra force will be
worked day and night. Two viaducts re
main to be built, and the preliminary
work upon these Is now well under way.
The officials are deliberating as to the
number of train* that will be run over
the new line. At the present time the com
pany is running three trains a day over
its old valley branch. One of these trains
leaves at 9 a. m., a second, the "owl,"
leaves at 5 p. m.. and the third, which is
an accommodation and goes through to
New. Orleans, leaves a few minutes after
the "Owl." ...
General Passenger Traffic Manager Mc-
Cormlck said 'yesterday that while no
definite conclusion had yet been reached
there will in all probability be two through
trains run over the coast road, the plan
being to transfer one of the valley trains
to the coast line, which would make four
through trains a day to and from Los An
peles. It Is likely that the New Orleans
train will be the one transferred to the
new line. In addition to the through
trains there will be a number of local ac
commodations, the number depending
upon the demand.

The conference that has been going on
for three weeks between Manager Fill

iVOTE EARLY AND VOTE RIGHT.
ON your way downtown this morning stop at
your polling place and vote before you begin
the business of the day. Do not postpone the
I duty until the afternoon. For every citizen of the
I Union voting is the chief . responsibility of the day,
I and should be attended to before anything else. At-.
j tend to it promptly yourself and then' get around
i among your friends and urge them to action.
No citizen will be justified" in staying away from
the polls to-day merely because- he deems Republi
can success so certain that his vote .will not be needed.
Every vote will be needed. Not one should be lack
ing from the mighty majorities in the State and the
J nation which w"iH not only re-elect McKinley but will
! crush and discredit Bryanism forever.
Vote to-day as an evidence of your. patriotic regard
I for the welfare of the people and the honor of the'Ve-
Bear in mind to-day that demagogy cannot perform
the duties of statecraft, much' talking cannot supply
the place, of brains; nor Bryanisrri fulfill in American
â¢life the requirements of patriotism.
This shooting costume Is made of khaki
covert coat cloth. The corsage Is com
posed of a waistcoat of chamois colored
cloth, -with gold buttons, and over It is a
bolero of the cloth. The skirt has a nar
row apron, and Is trimmed with a shaped
flounce. The hat is of soft mauve feh,
trimmed with gauze . and an eagle's
feather. .
SHOOTING COSTUME
A vote for a dishonest politician is a vote for dis
honest politics;- it is a vote against the welfare of
California and the honor of the party the. base can
didate assumes to represent. There can be no justi
fication for voting for such a candidate. Let every
one of them be defeated.
The canvass has been finished, the campaign is
closed. There is no use going over again the old
truths that have been emphasized by The Call again
and again during the contest. The voters of each
district who are sufficiently intelligent to study the
issues of a campaign and the characteristics of oppos
ing candidates ane well aware of their duties this
morning. They know well what.candidates have evil
reputations resulting from official scandals in the past
and ominous scandals to come should those candi
dates regain office. The voters also know what can
didates are honest men, having' the support of good
men, and who in office will be backed by the better
elements of the community, and will be stanch advo
cates of all measures for the public good. All, there
fore, that is necessary at this time is to recall those
facts to mind and to impress upon every voter the
importance of his individual responsibility in the elec
tion.
<T~) EAR in mind to-day that the welfare of Califor-
K\ nia in the elections is dependent not only upon
*â*. the success of the Republican. party in national
politics, but upon the election of honest men to the
Legislature. Not a single "crooked politician"
should be elected to any office no matter upon which
ticket he be nominated. Each voter should go to
the polls resolved to stand for honest politics in State
and nation alike.
CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE.
Let us have upon the Superior bench Judges in
whose courts there will be no scandals, whose deci
sions will be so firmly founded in law that the Su
preme Court will not have to overrule them and thus
impose new trials and increased costs upon litigants.
Vote for the candidates we have named and protect
the rights of all.
Those are the rules every good citizen must folloy:
to-day in voting for candidates for the Superior
Court. The Call pracrices what it preaches. It is a
stanch and stalwart Republican paper, upholding the
nationaJ ticket and all the great principles and wise
policies of the party; but in advocating certain can
didates for the bench it set aside all thought of parti
sanship. It has recommended during the campaign
the election of James V. Coffey, William R. Dainger
field, William P. Lawlor and M. C Sloss for full
terms aftid Frank H. Kerrigan for the uneacpired term.
That recommendation it renews this morning.
UPON the character and the learning of the
Judges of our courts the personal and property
rights of all citizens are dependent Even
those who never in their lives have had any litigation
in the courts are none the less indebted to the
Judges, for were not the laws fairly enforced every
one would soon be subject to the encroachments of
the unscrupulous. In the election of candidates for
the Superior bench the citizen should therefore ex
ercise the highest faculties of his nature. Desiring
honest Judges, he must be honest in determining:
for whom to vote; desiring men of intelligence, he
must himself be intelligent in making choice of the
many contestants; desiring impartial courts, he must
free his own mind from partisanship when voting for
those who arc to preside over the courts.
THE SUPERIOR BENCH.
California loses money when she taxes her own
bonds and those of her municipalities and counties,
for taxation drives such bonds out of the State, ami
the annual interest payments have to be sent out ot
the State also; therefore vote for "Amendment No.
4, being Senate constitutional amendment 14, ex
empting such bonds from taxation." Let us keep our
bonds for home investment and save the interest
money we now pay to outsiders.
In making up a ticket of his own from the candi
dates of the different parties the voter must be care
ful not to vote for one too many." Should he do ?o
all his votes for candidates for that office will be
thrown out. Make no mistake. .Let us have no votes
lost to-day on account of errors in the balloting.
VOTERS who are in doubt how many candidates
they are entitled to vote for for a particular office
should post themselves before entering the poll
ing booth, for there is no information or instruction
given upon that subject by the official ballot. The
lesson is not difficult. Let each voter bear in mind
that he is entitled to vote for the following:
Nine candidates for Presidential and Vice Presi
dential Electors.
Four Judges of the Superior Court for the fall
term. '..... * , - .
One Judge of the Superior Court (unexpired
term). Â¦
Five Justices of the Peace-
One Representative in Congress.
One State Senator (in districts where Senators are
to be elected).
One member of the Assembly.
HOW MANY TO VOTE FOR.
Vote for "Amendment No. 7, being Senate consti
tutional amendment No. 15," and thus authorize San
Francisco and Vallejo to pay their just debts. Hon
esty wrongs no man.
Sear in mind that California should have in Con
press a solid delegation in favor of sound money,
protection and progress. Vote for Kahn in the
Fourth District; vote for Loud in the Fifth. Let
California be worthily represented at Washington.
There is no need in California for three courts of
appeal in addition to the Supreme Court, so unless
you are in favor of creating new offices for tax
eaters at the expense of taxpayers vote against
"Amendment No. 8, being Senate constitutional
amendment No. 22, relative to the judiciary and es'
tablishing courts of appeal."

CIRCUSâ L. B., City. This correspond
ent asks: "Why Is It that a circus can
not stay In a city or town less than live
days nor more than ten days?" The an
swer Is that a circus is a traveling show
and arranges Its dates before starting out
on a. circuit. Its expenses are bo great
that it would not pay to remain in a large
city less than five days, and why it does
not remain more than ten days is that It
must move to keep up future dates, and
the further reason that in ten days almost
every person who wants to see the circus
has seen it.

With Mr. Bryan's party in the control of the Fed
eral Government there will be a progressive process
of equalizing Southern and Northern wages by low
ering the Northern to the level of the Southern scale.
This is the real peril of labor in this country. There
is none in the Chinese issue, which is settled for all
time.
The Southern convict law rents convicts to farmers,
miners and manufacturers, and that form of compul
sory labor is an inducement to put as many negroea
es possible in stripes that their servile toil may be
used again under the lash for the benefit of the South
ern employer. Soon this convict and cheap labor
competition is going to be felt, and the Northern la
borer will have an object lesson furnished by the
States which are now solid for Mr. Bryan. Southern
labor is deprived of the ballot The negro working
man is not allowed to. vote. The franchise, that right
preservative of all rights, is taken away from him.
He cannot protect his wages nor his scale of living at
the ballot-box. He is not permitted to organize a
labor union, and, if he were, it would be powerless to
protect him without the ballot. Northern labor will
by and by find it necessary to unionize Southern la
bor, and where its agents go among Mr. Bryan's
friends for that purpose they will be met with the
seme shotgun that has kept the negro away from the
polls.
The real peril to all American labor is in the condi
tion of labor in the South, in the States which will
give their electoral votes to Mr. Bryan. The labor
there is performed by the negroes. It is cheaper thau
any labor in Europe. The aim of Southern employers
has been to keep wages down to what formerly repre
sented the cost of feeding and clothing their slaves.
Farm labor in Mississippi gets $6 a month, As long
as this cheap labor produced only the agricultural
staples of the South the North did not feel its compe
tition in the final market. It produced cotton, sugar,
tobacco and rice, products non-competitive with
Northern products, except in the case of sugar, of
which the Southern cutput is small and was not felt
by the beet sugar product of the North. Now, how
ever, conditions have changed. This cheap labor of
the South is every year more largely employed in
mining and manufacturing, and its product competes
with ours in the final market
THE Chinese issue is false and artificial. Exclu
sion is the permanent policy of this Government
and of all parties. The statute of exclusion will
be renewed at the end of its tenure.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The Republican party has nominated strong men in
evecy district in the State. Many of them have al
ready served in Congress and have now acquired the
experience which will enable them to be of more
efficient help than ever to the interests of their con
stituents. Each and all of these candidates' should be
elected. California should send to Congress a dele
gation standing as a unit for prosperity and progress.
Let every district do its share toward swelling the
Republican majority in the House. Let us make a.
clean sweep.
There is no district in California that can hope to
profit anything by the election of a Bryanite Repre
sentative. Such a man could be of no service to his
constituents. At best he could be nothing more than
a negative quantity in the House, while if he entered
actively upon Bryanite* tactics he would be an oppo
nent of progress and. an antagonist of Californian as
well as national interests, and would injure his con
stituents more than he could help them.
In all considerations of this phase of the contest it
must be borne in mind that the Democrats have vir
tually abandoned the fight for the Presidency and are
now directing all their efforts to obtain control of the
House. In many districts they have nominated the
strongest man they could find who would consent to
make the contest under Bryan's standard. That
means, of course, that in every Congressional district
Republicans must continue an active, aggressive cam
paign until the polls close.
The figures given nre the "bedrock" estimates. In
explaining them Mr. Babcock stated: "During the
past thirty days there has been a marked change in
the conditions, more so than in any campaign with
which I have ever been connected since 1894. The re
ports coming in from all sections of the country agree,
and without a single exception show large Republi
can gains. If this continues until election day as it
has during the past two weeks no one is wise enough
to say what the Republican majority may reach. It
will certainly exceed my figures, which I consider safe
and conservative. There are many districts that were
not considered debatable on the first day of Septem
ber where our chances to win are now more than
even, and if the Republican organizations throughout
the country continue the active, aggressive campaign
that they have made since the middle of September
there is no reason why the majority in 1900 should
not nearly approach that given in 1896."
Chairman Babcock of the Republican Congressional
Committee has recently announced that from a care
ful survey of the whole field,' with full reports from
every doubtful district before him, he is sure there
will be at least 197 Republican members in the next
House. As there will be required 179 to organize the
House, that will give the Republicans a working ma
jority of 18. That much of success is now estimated
to be certain, and nothing but an improbable negli
gence on the part of Republican voters can disap
point the expectation.
DURING the whole course of this campaign Re
publican leaders have been doubtful of the
outcome of the elections for members of the
House of Representatives. No attempt has been
made to conceal the clanger in that quarter; there
have been no claims of sure success, but, on the con
trary, there has been a persistent warning uttered
over and over again by Senator Hanna and other3
to Republicans not to be overconfident in any dis
trict, but to make the fight with vigor from start to
finish. That being so, it is gratifying to note that
late reports from the whole country have given good
grounds for expecting a Republican majority in the
House. It is now asserted that victory there as well
as in the fight for the Presidency is well assured.
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
Until we have a primary law we will never be able
to break the power of the ward bosses and their
gangs. Therefore every man who believes in hon
est politics should vote for "Amendment No. 5,
being Senate constitutional amendment No. 4, con
cerning primary elections." Make sure of the amend
ment and beat the bosses.

I regard the retention of the Philippines

HON. JOHN D. GOODWIN OF PLUMAS
WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FROM BRYAN
e *
Has Voted^Democratic Ticket for Half a Cen
tury, but Now Working for McKinley's
Re-election.
HON. JOHN D. GOODWIN, the
leading Democrat of Plumas
County, has come out for Mc-
Kinley. He has declared his
position in the following state
ment:
I have been a Democrat for fifty years:
never voted anything but the Democratic
ticket. Four years ago I stumped, Plumas
County for Bryan and made several Bry
an speeches In the State at- large. I am
still a Democrat, but a'Jeffersonlan Dem
ocrat. I am supporting McKlnley this
year. The immense output of gold has
made money more plentiful than ever be
fore. I cannot indorse antl-expanslon. All
parties united supported the war with
Spain. The results of it are In line with
Democratic principles. I have always
been an advocate of expansion as one of
the great tendencies of the party, and
that being the' paramount issue I could
not do otherwise than support McKinley.
I should regard the election of Bryan as
It cannot be possible that any patriotic American
can see any benefit to his country in the destruction
of these domestic interests and the degradation of the
nation that would follow the election of Bryan.
Therefore, before you vote for Mr. Bryan make up
your mind that it will be a good thing to surrender
the market we have conquered or hold it by reducing
the wages of labor.
If Mr. Bryan is elected to carry out his threat to
destroy the* gold standard, capital will no longer work
cheap, and if we hold the world's market, which we
have conquered by cheap production, it can be done
only by reducing the wages of labor.
We have had the most rapid rise in foreign trade
the world has ever seen. We have distanced all rivals.
We have the best and the cheapest production on th^
planet. Therefore we undersell the other nations and
are the primate of the trade of the globe. This
economy in production has been secured not by
cheapening labor, but by cheapening capital. Labor
and capital are the two partners in production. To
undersell the world and hold its trade one must work
cheaper here than anywhere else. Under the gold
standard capital is working cheaper here than else
where, and we have the cheapest production without
reducing the wages of labor.
The gold standard law has made us the world's
commercial clearing-house. Commercial balances are
settled in New York instead of London. We keep
the profits of the world's exchange. If Bryan is
elected to carry out his threat this proud and profitable
position will be sacrificed. Will that benefit any one?
Don't vote for Bryan unless you can convince your
self that commercial clearings should be sent back to
London.
Let none be deceived into believing that our excel
lent industrial and commercial condition could con
tinue under the Nebraska man's policies. The para
mount question is not external, but internal.. The
Philippine complication cannot be settled by Mr.
Bryan. The people are not yet ripe for its final ad
justment They have not grasped its extent nor its
significance, and they will not risk everything at stake
at home by assuming that though Bryan is wrong on
every domestic policy he is right on one issue of ex
ternal policy. In statesmanship it is always safe to as
siime that a man who is fatally and vitally wrong on a
majority of public issues cannot usefully settle the mi
nority of such issues.
Bryan's 'defeat four years ago resulted in', the es
tablishment of the gold standard. The adoption ' of
that standard has reduced interest on .our. public debt
to 2 "per cent per annum and our 2 per cent bonds arc
st a premium of 4V2. This means that we have the
best public credit ever enjoyed by any nation. Mr.
Bryan says the gold standard will be destroyed as
soon as he gets the power to destroy it. Before voting
for him let every man remember that destruction, of
the gold standard means higher interest on the pub
lic debt, and an injury to the public credit. It means
an assault on the national pride and the private purse
of. every taxpayer who pays the interest on the pub
lic debt. Will either be a benefit to the country and
the people? If they will inflict harm, don't vote for
Mr. Bryan. The gold standard has made us the
keeper of the world's capital. We are no longer a
debtor nation. We ?re not borrowing money from
the rest of the world and paying interest, but are
lending money to the other nations and receiving in
terest. Among the commands of Moses to the chil
dren of Israel was this profound financial and eco
nomic statement, "Owe no man anything, but lend
to all nations." While commercial depressions come
under all systems, they are less prolonged and dis
tressing to the people of a nation that is a creditor
and not a debtor. If we maintain our present posi
t-on as a creditor, with no public or private securities
held abroad to be sent home in a panic for liquida
tion, we have the surest guarantee" against prolonged
hard times. Mr. Bryan's election, giving him the
power to execute his threat to destroy the gold stan
dard, will destroy the basis upon which we are now
the world's creditor instead of its debtor. We will
undergo a rapid and distressing transformation, and
will part with our surest protection against panic.
WHAT BRYANISM WOULD MEAN
T~2 EFORE citizens vote to-day they should se
[\ riously' reflect upon what four years of Bryan
â ism would mean to the country.
FLORIDA TIMES-UNIONâ It la not
necessary that the South seek vindication
for her hero by placing him beyond the
rampart of hi3 stainless private life: she
Is equally proud of his public career and
of all his official course. There is no
change that would not be for the worsÂ»;
while his generalship may have been at
fault for the lops of Gettysburg, even that
brought out the matchless answer to the
tearful cry of Pickett: "My division has
been annihilated." "It was my fault." said
Lee. Let all America thank God that Lee
was given to show mankind the soil that
produced Washington had not become less
fruitful: let mankind take heart to know
that such men are possible.

physical strain of campaigning shortened
the days of Douglas, Greely and Blaine.
although not one of those- candidates
made a quarter of the number of speeches
which Bryan made In 1396. or which he
has delivered this year. There are reports
that he is really running for the Senator
ship, and not for the Presidency at all.
This would account for his persistence
in maintaining a contest which he and
every other sane Bryanite In the United
States knows Is going overwhelmingly
against him.
BOSTON TRANSCRIPTâ The long life
of Sims Reeves' voice has been accounted
for in two ways: First, by his perfection
of tone production; next, by the extraor
dinary care he took of himself. After he
had nrmly established his reputation he
obstinately refused to sing unless in abso
lutely good condition. So pertinaclou3
was his refusal that his "physician's ce-
tlttcate" came In time to be a standing
Joke with the English public; In his later
years it was even considered a piece o.*
unusual good luck If he appeared when
announced.
PHILADELPHIA NORTH AMERICAN
â U has been an exceptional campaign in
the absence of excitement and turmoil,
but only seemingly an apathetic political

NEAV YORK TRIBUNEâ Imagine Abra
ham Lincoln coming to New York In 1S<5O
and refusing to discuss the slavery ques
tion, which had brought him before thÂ«Â»
country just as the silver question
brought Mr. Bryan before the country,
simply because New York was a com
munity where the Douglas? view of slav

this trimmer e*d pettifogger poses as a
new Lincoln, ltmplred with a great and
heroic moral purpose:

Bear in mind, Bryan has said: "J do not
want any man to vote for me and then object
to my doing what I expect to do if you elect me,'
and if I can prevent the maintenance of the goli
standard you can rely on my doing it the very first

handed down an opinion yesterday re

matter of the duties on yellow metal
sheathing used on the Alden Besse.. J. D.
Spreckels & Bros.' Company appealed to
the Cnited States Circuit Court trim the
decision of the Board of Appraisers.
In his opinion Judge Morrow said: "It
could hardly, have been intended by Con
gress to permanently exclude from the
coastwise' trade for ten months in the
year a vessel built in the United States
because it had used in its construction or
equipment free of duty, some foreign
materials, the life of which was of short
duration. Is there any warrant for the
assumption that Congress Intended to lm
pose a duty upon material after it had
ben used and had become perfectly worth
less, simply as a penalty for Its retention
upon the vessel ?' f
The court decided that the assumption
was unwarranted and that the duty need
not be paid."

ment on the ground that the board would
be derelict In its duty if some legislation
was not adopted against public gambling.
"The ordinances are sweeping ,ln their
provisions. I must admit," said Comte,
"but it is not possible to reach only par
ticular gambling places."
Tobin, In explaining the report of the
committee, said that the object of th& or
dinances could be accomplished by the
Police Commissioners refusing to grant a
license to- any place where gambling was
conducted In a disorderly manner.
"The Police 'Commission." said Tobln,
"had sought to cast the responsibility, of
stopping gambling on the board. The or
dinance la supposedly directed against
the gambling In the Cafe Royal and It has
not been proven that gambling Is con
ducted in a disorderly manner in that
place."
Comte said the board could not afford
to shift the responsibility of restricting
gambling.
"There is no such thing as thÂ« orderly
conduct of a gambling place such as tho
Cafe Royal," said Comte. "I move that
the matter be referred again to the Po
lice Committee with instructions to re
port."
Â¦ This motion was lost and the vote on
the Indefinite postponement of the" ordi
nance was:
Ayesâ Boxton, Brandenstein, Braun

The bill regarding the care of animals
sick with contagious diseases and, pro
viding for the disposition thereof was re
ferrea I back to the Hospital â¢Committee.
McCarthy submitted an amendment,
which provides that the owner or ; custo
dian of any sick animal must upon de
mand by the Board of Health show to the
latter's satisfaction that he or she ia com
petent to care properly for said animal
or that the animal is under the carÂ© of a
veterinary surgeon. The * amendment
continues:
Section 6 â If any developed case of sickness
shall be pronounced incuraole , by . said board
or by its designated veterinary surgeon said
board is hereby authorized, empowered and di
rected to kill the animal so infected with In
curable sickness - and to matt such disposition
of the carcass t thereof as It may. deem best;
provided, however, that T If the owner or man
ager of said Â¦ animal at the : time of such de
cree has employed a recognized veterinary sur
geon to treat the animal and said veterinary
does not agree with the Board of Health as to
the impossibility of effecting a cure, then, and
in that* event, the> owner or; manager, of such
animal. shall be riven the 'benefit of the doubt

Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was
compelled to end the misery of a valuable
horse yesterday by shooting it through
the head. The unfortunate animal brought
on Its own death by backing Into a freight
train. He was dragged more than twenty
feet before the train could be brought to
a standstill, and when the bruised and
bleeding beast regained his feet he pre

was crushed into kindling wood.
The horse and vehicle were the property

The Orpheum is presenting a bill of
bright, particular stars this week, each
of whom is well worth the price of ad
mission. Chief among the new comers Is
Maggie Moore, who used to delight thea
ter goers in the palmy days of the old
California Theater. "Aue cannot wither
nor custom stale the infinite varletv" of
Maggie's entertaining powers. Her por
trayal of the character of the Irishwoman
is as unctuous as it is true to nature. In
Clay Greene's comedy entitled "Kittle
Malone" she succeeded in delighting her
audience, and her Irish songs and oper
atic burlesque brought down the house.
Her niece. Osgood Moore, is a graceful
dancer and makes a pretty boy.
The Dtinham family of four was seen
in an act that is wonderful as well as
thrilling. Such an exhibition of aerialis
tic powers has seldom been witnessed
here, and the ease with which the va
rious turns are performed excited un
bounded admiration.

we forget the other characters, and" when
Salassa is silent, the voices of the others
break in upon our entrancement like dis
cordant sounds that smash into nothing
ness the golden weavings of a voluptuous
dream.
Of course there can be no Othello with
out a good Iago, and the great Salassa is
so good an Iago that in listening to his
marvelously mellow barytone, and In
Lyric tenors who act as well as they
sing are extremely rare, and still rarer
are those who act better than they sing.
Signor Vittore Emanuel Castellano is one
of the still rarer. Not that he does not
sing well also, but while his voice is suf
ficiently strong for the role of Othello it
is lacking in the qualities of mellowness
and rotundity, and at times is harsh, un
sympathetic, and, O, horror! Bucjrestive
of a squeak. But when the role allows
him to turn himself loose on the uooer
leger lines of a fortissimo jealousy you
realize that there is something in Signor
Vittore Emanuel Castellano after all.

There is no actor in San Francisco, how
ever clever, who cannot learn something
by attending the professional matinee to
which Mr. Robson and his friends have
generously consented to give their time on
Wednesday afternoon.
In such a long cast where all do well It
is difficult to apportion due praise to all.
Yet in this second, notice one must not
overlook the effectiveness of those who
carry the little partsâ such as that o*
Drummond (Mr. B. Washburn), "who
leads the laugh at Drury Lane." and of
Tony LumnKin (Mr. Edward Dodge).
Even the little man (Mr. Long), who plays
the tailors boy, is an artist in his line
and helps to make the ensemble what It
should be.
Last night Stuart Robson and his capi
tal company opened tho.'r second week in
Augustus Thomas' "Oliver Goldsmith."
This charming p!ay loses nothing by repe
titionâone notices the second time deli
cate points that do not come out clearly
on a lirst hearing. Such are Goldsmith's
instinctive drawing back when he hears
Garrick announced; Mary Horneck's little
burst of indignation when she perceives
that Goldsmith Is pained by the practical
joke played upon him; Catherine Hoi â¢
neck's exquisite' by-play in the scene
where Garrick makes actor-love to her.
One forgets that the historical perspective
i.Â« not quite rightâ that is really of little
'moment so long as the characterization is
true to what we know of Goldsmith and
his famous friends.

Is done Â¦ by Runneis, in the character

and a socialistic trend, attracted a good
house at the Alcazar Theater last night.
All of the favorites in the popular stock

cast, and the "play received a thoroughly
worthy and well balanced Interpretation.
Howard Hall has a grateful part in Reu
ben Warner, the superintendent of "the
, works," and plays the role with fine fer
vor and artistic .balance. Howard Scott
is the militant aristocrat, Ralph Standish
does excellent work and Clarence Mon

pood, if not quite convincing. Edwin T.
Emery, Clarence Arper, Carlyle Moore,
George P. Webster and Ernest Howellâ
the latter especially true in his rendering
of the old workman Ber.selâ all fill their
roles acceptably.
Miss Lorena Atwood is a charming and
sincere Margaret Knowlton; Ada Lewis is
an altogether delightful "tough" girl,
known as "Cinders": Polly Stockwell is
the tfretty ingenue, Polly Fletcher, and
Miss Juliet Crosby as the crippled "Nell"
plays a painful part with gTace and re

A woman is sick â some disease peculiar to her sex is fast
developing in her system. She goes to her family physician
and tells him a story, but not the whole story.
She holds back something, loses her head, becomes agi-
tated, forgets what she wants to say, and finally conceals
what she ought to have told, and this completely mystifies
the doctor. O
Is it a wonder, therefore, that the doctor fails to cure the
disease ? Still we cannot blame the woman, for it is very em-
barrassing to detail some of the symptoms of her suffering,
even to her family physician. This is the reason why
hundreds of thousands of women, are- now in corre-
spondence with Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass. To
her they can give every symptom, so that when she is ready
to advise them she is in possession of more facts from her
correspondence with the patient than the physician can,
possibly obtain through a personal interview.
Following we publish a letter from a* woman showing the
I result of a correspondence with Mrs. Pinkham. All such
I letters are considered absolutely confidential by
B Mrs. Pinkham, and are never published in any way or
| manner without the consent in writing of the patient ; but
I hundreds of women are so gratefulfor the health which Mrs.
1 Pinkham and her medicine have been able to restore to them
1 that they not only consent to publishing their letters, but
S write asking that this be done in order that other women
I who suffer may be benefited by their experience.

Academy of Sciences Hall was crowded
laj=t night by an audience called to listen
to a lecture on the Laramie Plateau by
; Professor Andrew C. Lawson of the Uni

lecturer traced the steps by which the
scientist presents to tho modern world
models of prehistoric animals. Aided by
stereopticon views the speaker carried his
hearers with him to the fields where thÂ«
bones of beings that were are found.
Every stage in the presentation of the
strange counterfeits of the strange
creatures was described from the
discovery of the gigantic bones/their ship

VTJI. HOW TO CORRECT COMMON
BLTJNDEHS.
1. Walt on, wait for. Distinguish clearly
between these two phrases. To wait on
means to attend on. while to wait for
means to stop or delay for. It is incorrect
to say "Let us wait on the corner on
Will."
2. Stop, stay. To stop means to cease to
go forward, to leave off; to stay means to
abide, to tarry, to dwell. He may stay,
not stop, at home, at a hotel, with a
friend.
3. Heathy, wholesome. The first of these
two words is often improperly used for
the second. A man may be healthy, but
the focd he eats is said to be wholesome.
4. Decided, decisive. A decided opinion
is an opinion which Is strongly upon one
side- a decisive opinion is one that is final.
Â¦ 5. Brief, concise. An article Is brief
when it is merely short: it Is concise whÂ«o
it Is short and also condensed.
6. Apparent, obvious. Do Â«6t say "The
truth of that is apparent"; Use obvious or
evident. Apparent is the opposite of real;
obvious is the opposite of obscure.
7. Situation, site. Situation embraces all
the local aspects in which a thing is
placed; site is the actual ground selected
for location.
8. Sewage, sewerage. The former refers
to the contents of sewers; the latter to a
system ot sewers.
9. Majority, plurality. These words are
often confused. A man has the majority
of the votes when he has more than half
of the whole number cast; he has a plu
rality when his votes exceed those of any
other candidate. A plurality is not neces
sarily a majority when theie are more
than two candidates.
IX. HOW TO BECKON INTEREST.
Interest is a charge for the use of
money. The princiral is the sum for thÂ»
use of which interest is charged. The rate
Is the per cent of the principal which Is
charged for its use for one year. Bv 6 per
cent interest we mean a charge of $6 per
year for every $100. Accurate Interest Is
reckoned on a basis of 365 days to the
year; business Interest is reckoned on a
basis of 361) days to the year. Legal in
terest is interest which is computed at
the rate per cent established by law. To
charge a higher rate ot interest than 13
allowed by law Is called usury, for which
penalties are imposed by tho laws of
nearly all the States. Debts of all kinds
draw Interest from the time they become
due. but not before unless so specified.
1 The following rules for reckoning accu
rate Interest can bo easily remembered:
1. Principal X Rate X Time in years
Divide by 100.
2. Principal X Rate X Time in months.
Divide by 1200.
8. Principal X Rate X Time In days.
Divide by 38.50).
Where possible the time should be In
dicated In years and fractions of a year,
or in months and fractions of a month.
For Instance. 2 years 6 months = 2H
j-ears: 3 years 9 months = 3*4 years; 4
months 13 days = ili months, etc To di
vide by 100 simply point off two decimal
places; to divide by 1200 point off two deci
mal places and divide by 12: to divide by
36.5C0 point off two decimal places and di
vide by 365. Sometimes the work can be
simplified by cancellation, as follows:
Find the interest on $2190 for S3 days at
5 per cent.

speech, called attention to the necessity
or keeping a Congressman in office for
several consecutive terms, as that Is the
only way in which he can gain power in
tne House and become of much service to
his State. Mr. Kahn closed by urging the
support of the Republican ticket from top
to bottom.

days, or 20 days. One-quarter of CO Is S

Sunset District held its final Republican
rally of the season at Park View Hall
on Ninth avenue last evening. It was a
memorable occasion in the district, for a
squad of "rooters" put in an appearance
armed with gig-antic horns, with which
the points made by the speakers were
uproariously greeted. All the people in
the neighborhood were present. A huge
bonfire blazed In front of the hall all the
evening. Alfred P. SomervlUe presided
and made a strong appeal for the good of
the district. His remarks were generally
of a Ibcal application. He said that all
the Sunset District desired to be placed
In the Thirty-seventh Assembly District
and to abolish K street as a dividing line.
It was the hope of the people of the en
tire district that the coming- Legislature
would erlve the relief that was asked, and
he urged the people to attend to that mat
ter by exerting their influence with those
who should be elected from this city to
go to Sacramento. His remarks . were
loudly applauded. Senator Wolfe follow
ed. At the close of the speaking three
cheers were given for McKinley and the
entire Republican ticket.

Other speakers were Myron E. Wolf,
Davis Louderback, H. A. Melvin of Ala

"Where are the ships," asked Mr. Kahn,
"which four years ago were lying idle in
RIchardsons Bay? They are carrying
cargoes of American products to every
country under the sun, and the only ves

are the ones which are waiting for wharf
room upon which to lay down their
freight."
Julius Kahn made a short speech, pref
acing his remarks by saying that he
thought a lengthy address would be out
of place at the present time. He reviewed
his work for the State in Congresa and
related an interview he had had with Sec
retary Hay, showing how the adminis

"Mr. Kahn," said the Secretary to the
Congressman, "if you can get a bill past

half of that body Mill present for the ac
tion of the Board of Supervisors and the
State Legislature a bill to regulate the
erection and maintenance of scaffolds for
the use of painters and other artisans on
buildings in course of erection.
A meeting of the Painters' Union was
held last evening and Congressman
Kahn's offer was presented for the con
sideration of thÂ© members of the union. A
rising vote of thanks to the Congressman
was suggested and carried by the memÂ«
bers of the union. At the next meeting
of the Supervisors the members of the
union will be on hand to lend their In
fluence in aid of Mr. Kahn's efforts to
pass an ordinance which will protect them
and their families.
The bill Is for the purpose of regulating
the maintenance of scaffolds and holding
the parties erecting the same responsible
for accidents which may occur to their
employes owing to any defects in the
same. Within the last year the union
has buried fifteen members, has cared for
four, who are now in the hospital, and
has supported two members who now
wear steel jackets to protect their spines,
all injured in accidents caused by defec
tive scaffolds. In no case, the union al
leges, has the employer of a killed or
maimed member of the union seen fit to
contribute toward his family's relief
The proposed law Is therefore Intended
to insure protection to the families of the
dead or maimed in analogous cases
The law for the protection of those
forced to work on scaffolds will be framed
after that now in force In Xew York City.

We shall now tabÂ© up what Is known
as business interest, which is reckoned
upon a basis of 3(50 days to the year.
By dropping the five days we get an
even multiple of 12, or 20 days for a
month, and It is upon this basi3 that thÂ»
interest la considered.
Suppose that it is reculred to find the
Interest on $4500 for 60 days at 8 per cent.
The work would appear as follows if we
substitute 360 for 3tÂ»:
4C00X60X6
360X100 =$45.00
The Interest is $45. or one-hundredth of
the principal. Then, to find the interest
upon any sum of money at 6 per cent for
60 c'ays simply divido the principal by
100â that is, cut off two decimal placea.
At 6 per cent for SO days the Interest on
51234.00 = $12.34.
&J2.70 =: 9. S3.
SbM.02= S6.91.
When we know the interest for 60 days
we can easily find the Interest for any
number of days: and If we know the in
terest at 6 per cent we can easily find the
Interest at 7 per cent by adding one-aixih.
at/5 per cent by subtracting one-sixth, at
7*i per cent by adding one-quarter, and
so on.

CHICAGO, Nov. 5.â Wheat was a dull mar
ket throughout the session, lave for a brief
period of agility at the start. This being the
eve of a national election, tradeâ¢ were dis
inclined to pro Into Important deals, and even-
Ing up over the holiday divided attention with
betting haberdashery on the result of to-mor
row's balloting. There was practically no cash
den-.and either here or at the seaboard. The
rnniket opened firm, December, US'MiO up at

shipments and in the amount on passage. Fol
lowing the opening December dropped to 73T4c
on profit-taking, but later recovered and closed

WILLIAM CLIFT'S
WILL IS FILED
William R. Davis touched upon the
campaign' issues that were not treated by
Mr. Metcalf. He showed conclusively that
there is no danger of militarism or im
perialism in this country.
It has been my misfortune, for the most part
of the campaign to be In the country" of the
enemy. To-nlRht I find myself In the presence
of my friends. AH Indications point to a land
slide for McKinley and Roosevelt, prospority
and progress, to-morrow. Never In their lives
have such questions of vital interest been pre
sented by the two Kreat parties as now. The
Republican party has no apologies to offÂ«>r this
campaign. It has a record to stand on. It is
not a record built upon the shifting sands of
time, but upon the rock of Gibraltar.
The Democratic party has never lived up to
the principles enunciated In the Declaration .if
Independence about which they are doing so
much talking now. History records many In
stances where they violated It. What Is all this
anxiety about the people in the new posses
sions beltisr crushed and put In bondage and
what about the consent of the governed? Why
all this, .when hundreds of thousands of ne-
Kroes, natives of these l?nlted States and citi
zens., are denied the right of suffrage by the
law of Intimidation In the South? Nothing is
said "by Mr. Bryan about that. Yet It is a.
fact that it Is being done only to perpetuate
Democratic power In these States.
Mr. Lukens expressed himself as pleased
at the happy auspices under which the
campaign was closing. The triumph for
the party of progress and prosperity, he
said, would come on the morrow, the
honor of the flag upheld and the Integrity
of the constitution maintained. The
chairman then introduced Victor H. Met
calf rs speaker of the evening, who said:
ThÂ© Republican campaign in Alameda
County came to a close this evening with
a big mass meeting in the Tabernacle.
Long before the gathering was called to
order every seat was filled and when the
marching clubs came In, sweeping with
them a great throng, every Inch of space
was taken, hundreds being denied en
trance. The crowd overflowed with good
feeling and every speaker received his
quota of cheers. . .
A. H. Breed, chairman of the Republi
can County Central Committee, called the
meeting to order and introduced as chair
man for the evening G. R, Lukens, of
whom he said: "To-morrow we shall ad
dress him as Senator Lukens."

estate, bonds and corporation stocks and
money aggregating; $100,000. This was fol

all of the real estate she has deeded until

not less than $300,000.

R. TV. Snow, Mayor of Oakland, says:
Fred M. Campbell, executive manager of
the Metcalf National Republican Congres
sional Committee, has the following to
Bay:
California will give McKinley 21.000 plurality
and Metcalf will have a plurality of S750 In
the Third Congressional District. I have the*e
figures upon reports I have received from every
county in the fUate. and from nearly every
precinct In the State. The Metcalf committee
hes had unusually excellent opportunity to net
at the political pltuatlon. Our correspondence
ha* been enormous and every political center
has been effectively reached. I am well oatU
fled with the estimate* which I make.
National Secretary.
The County Committeeman.
Arthur H. Breed, chairman of the Ala
meda County Republican Central Com
mittee, pays:
After a thorough canvass of the county with
report* from every precinct I place McKlnley'f
plurality in Alarneda County at an easy wvyi.
Metcalf will carr\' the county by BOno. 'He Is
sure to run ahead of the ticket. The Repub
llcnns will, without doubt, elect all of the six
AHÂ»emblyrr;en by good majorities, while Lukeno
for State Penator has a walkover. Conserva

Republican candidates for Supervisor without
any trouble. The Information I have received
frr.m the best and most reliable sources of
political Information leaves me confident In the
sweeping victory of the entire Republican
ticket In thiÂ« county. The Republican candi
dates for Superior Ju4c have not even the
semblance of a fight on hand.
Tiie campaign ha* been a, good one. Mr. Met
calf Is going to have a great majority. In
Yfilo, normally Democratic by 350 or 400, the
Republican* have made . a hard and gallant
fieht and they Â»xepert to elect their Assembly
man. The Republicans are- making a Vterllng;
battle in Stanislaus County, and they will
crowd the IVtnocrat* closely. Solano County
will pile up a tremendous majority for Mc-
Kinley. at IeÂ«Â»t TioO. â¢ Metcalf will run way
ahead of the ticket ther,e and 1 look for a
majority there for our distinguished Congreeo
mannf from 15<V) to l.Virt.
There is no doubt about the general result in
California. QOVIBOC Gage gave me an estimai-?
that the Republican majority south of Te
hacliaj'! will be 4<W> and upward.
There Is not any trouble, about the returned
poldlers. I have met many young men during
my campaigning who are discharged soldiers
fmm thÂ» Philippines. They tell mm that they
are FurrortlnK President McKinley to a man.
Those people at home, they pay. who. like the
Hrvanltfs. are finding fault and are abusing the
army, are guilty of the havst ingratitude. The
army is all right and the fault finders, say my
young friends, would, from a sensÂ»Â» of shame,
chanpe their views If before growling they
would investigate the real condition of affairs
in the Philippine*. This is the sentiment of
nine out of ten of the. soldiers who have been
mustered out.
Having completed a tour of the Central Cali
fornia counties, from Modesto to Yo!Â«. I am
prepared to say that California iÂ» Fafely Repub

flde calculation. My tour has demonstrate!
Fatirfactorily that no .Republicans who voted
for President McKinley In 1S36 will abandon
the adminlFtration now. I have also learned
with much irratifl>atlon that those silver Re
publicans who strayed oft four year* ago are
heck in line. At all of my meeting* I have met
many such men, who have unhesitatingly as
sorted their alleRlane^ and their adherence
again to the party.
William R. Davis, Presidential Elector
from the Third District, has stumped the
greater part of thÂ» State for McKinley
and gives this .view:
The Presidential Elector.
The most earnest and successful cam
paigiiT that has pone out of Alameda
County this year is Congressman Victor
H. Metcalf. Congressman Metcalf has
spoken In every town in his district, and
his reception ha? be<*n most enthusiastic.
He has not advocated his own candidacy,
hut has always spoken for the Republican
national ticket and ' for such local can
didates as might be running. Not once
In the large number of speeches that he
has made has he referred to his own nom
ination, but always to others. 'This care
ful ami painstaking campaign has made
a wonderful impression upon the mem
bers of the party in the. Third Congres
sional District. Mr. Metcalf Is sanguine
but n^t extravagant in his estimates for
the dl.-trict.
"I believe that Alameda County will give
about the same majority this year that
it did four years ago," said the Congress
man. "The indications are that the in
terior r,f the district will be strongly Re
publican. As for my own vote, I "hardly
expect to get as large a majority as he
fore. I nearly doubled the normal Repub
lican majority and I don't expect to do
that again."
The Congressman
OAKLAND. Nov. 5-Alameda County
will support the Republican ticket just
as loyally as it did two and four years
ago. Four years ago it was the unusual
Republican vote In Alameda that saved
the State to McKinley. l"p to that elec
tion the Republican majority had been
about 3000. rarely more. But Alameda
voted nobly for McKinley and by piling
up a majority of 5300, something that
was unhr-ard of before, paved th<Â» State.
It will not be necessary for Alameda
to save the State this year, but the coun
ty is going to do Its best tnwnrd keeping
the Republican banner, and the party
leader? believe that it will Rive as large
a majority as it did four years ago. The
registration is 2222 greater than at that
time, and the larger portion of this nÂ«*w
vote will be Republican, so that this will
offset any loss that may take place in
other quarters.

BARNES PRAISES KNOWLAND.
Republicans Close Campaign in Ala-
ineda With Big Meeting.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 5.-The Alameda Re
publicans closed their campaign to-night
with r\ rousing rally in Armory HaJl,
which ins packed with an eager and en
thusfasUc audience, including in Its num
bers many ladles. General W. H. L.
Barnes -was the orator of the occasion. He
arrived on the S:10 narrow gauge train and
was net at the Park-street station by a
delegation of solid McKinley and Roose
velt citisens and a brass band and escort
ed to the meeting hall.
To Dr. John T. Mcl/ean was accorded
the h^nor of presiding. He is one of Cali
fornia's venerable Republican stalwarts.
Dr. McLean's first vote was cast for
Henry '.'lay. and when he registers his
ballot to-morrow he will have voted for
fifteen candidates for the Presidency. His
was the hand that wrote the first call for
a Hepurllcan State Convention in Califor
nia in th>? early fifties. Chairman McLean
was in a particularly happy mood and his
introductory remarks evoked much ap
plause.
General Barnes was given an ovation
when he was Introduced. He launched
into a eulogy of Assemblyman Joseph R.
Knowland, who is a candidate for re-elec
tion to represent the Forty-seventh Dis
trict.
"I got to know Mr. Knowland well
during that memorable three months of
torture we enjoyed together during the
contest at Sacramento for United States
Senator. My young friend Knowland has
said that under the* same circumstances
he would support me for the same posi
tion again, but I want to say, ladies and
gentlemen, he will never again get the
opportunity. I believe that in that fight
I had the support of every untrammeled
and uncontrolled representative in Sacra
mento. Mr. Knowland was one of my
most loyal friends, and he made a* name
for ability and honesty that has never
been surpassed by any man who has ever
represented the people at Sacramento.
"I have been asked about my opinion
on the outcome of the national election.
I have some faith in betting men. I read
in the papers whore those who wager are
betting 5 to 1 on the general result and 10
to 1 on the outcome in New York. To
morrow I think the odds will be about 15
to 1 on McKinley and Roosevelt."
Short talks were made by Joseph R.
Knowland. Judge John Ellsworth and Dr.

SPANISH WAR VETERANS
. BEING MISREPRESENTED
Publication Makes Unauthorized
Statement That They Are
Against Metcalf.
OAKLAND. Nov. 5.â The so-called
Army and Navy Gazette which has
been issued in the Interests of Frank
Freeman, the Democratic candidate for
Congress against Victor H. Metcalf, has
caused lots of trouble In the organizations
which It Is sought to make it appear it
represents. Every artifice of wording has
been used to make it appear that the Ga
zette Is an official organ of th<* Army and
Navy League, the Grand Army and the
Spanish-American war veterans. The
sheet distinctly says "Spanish-American
War Veterans" under the heading, and an
effort Is made to have It appear that the
organization Is supporting Freeman and
the Democratic ticket. This has caused
all kinds of trouble in Â«the order.
"That is a misuse of the name of our
order." paid Ralph J. Faneuf. one of the
organizers of the order in Oakland. Mr.
Faneuf was a member of th*> Tenth Penn
sylvania Volunteers and went through the
entire Manila campaign, and has taken a
prominent part In the formation of a camp
in Oakland. "That shoet was issued by a
member and an officer In the order, and
he has attempted to make It appear that
the order Is backing a certain set of can
didates. This Is not true, and Is an at
tempt to use the order for political pur
poses. Our constitution expressly states
that no politics shall be allowed to creep
In. and the safety of our organization de
pends upon that. The matter has created
a great deal of dissatisfaction among the
members of the order, not on political
grounds alone, but because It Is an at
tempt to drag the order into politics. The
matter will undoubtedly be brought up at
the next meeting, and in the meantime we
are anxious to have it known that the or
der Is in no way responsible, for the Issu
ance of that sheet."

understanding Sill said no more.
VIEWING BLOOD-RED MOON
AT 4 A. M. HAS STRANGE EF
FECT ON A POLICEMAN.
OAKLAND. Nov. 5.â When Po
liceman Lee Andrews hears a
cry of "Fire!" nowadays he
runs for the nearest telegraph
pole and butts his head against
it with all the force that is encompassed
within his wide girth. It is like shaking
a red rag in front of a mad bull to men
tion the word within hearing of the vigi
lant patrolman. His friends are becom
ing seriously aJarmed lest some uncanny
experience has turned his brain. But the
story of Andrews' recent and now famous
attempt to extinguish the peaceful moon
by" calling out the Oakland Fire Depart
ment is all that is needed to quiet the
fears of inquirers.
Here is the remarkable tale of Andrews'
desperate effort to drive the orb of night
out of the heavens:
It happened a few nights ago that An
drews was near the close of his long vigil.
He was quietly easing his weary pedal ex
tremities at the corner of Seventh and
Market streets and awaiting the hour of
4 a. m., when he should report off and hie
himself to his couch to slumber. Mor
pheus had not quite captured the weary
bluecoat, but the sleepy god was nearly
upon his victim.
Suddenly Andrews plunged Into action.
Tn the haze of the morning he saw a great
light in the east. Huge volumes of smoke
clouded the air. As he gazed there passed
what seemed a great conflagration across
hi* vision. The policeman waited not,
but quickly grabbing a bicycle from the
near-by station scorched with all his
"Oh. I don't know." retorted Andrews.
"I never pawed myself Into the bay from
To make matters worse for the discon
certed Andrews. Police Sergeant Harry
Green. Policeman McSorley and Police
man Sill, who responded to the call, have
not done yet with their fun at the expense
of the man who was fooled by the moon.
The only thing that gives Andrews con
solation after his ludicrous faux pas is
the fact tbat he Isn't the only Oakland
policeman who ever made a blunder.
"Well you're a lobster." was Policeman
Sills* happy comment.
"Follow me," ordered the policeman,
who rushed to the alarm box at Seventh
and Washington streets, where he sent in
the signal that set the big clanging bells
stringing throughout the city. More en
pines, more hose carts, more fire trucks
tore through the streets, and then An
drews' fire loomed up as the biz, round
moon burst out in silvery glow from be
hind a cloud, placidly shedding: its rays
upon the astonished patrolman, halt a
hundred angry firemen and a bunch of
brother policemen who had responded to
Andrews' frantic- blasts upon his police
whistle for assistance in quenching the
enormous conflagration that had aroused
him.
Lights were up in a second. The hoarse
command of the captains mingled with
the tramping- of the prancing norses as
they dashed to their places. Then the
rumbling of the heavy engines. hose carts
and ladder truck in the still morning
aroused the neighborhood.
might to the lire engine house at Sixth
street and Broadway.
"Turn out. Fire! Fire!! Fire!!!" shout
ed the patrolman as he rattled and banged
at the doors. The sleepy fir Amen, aroused
by the extraordinary disturbance, plied
out half clad.

Hardly cooled out after having been
touched up over the win of David S In
the opening event at Oakland yesterday
the members of the ring met another
facer in the number following. Argot, a
filly by Kosseau-Josle G, carrying tb.3
colors of M. F. Tarpey, politician, mining
man and ranch owner, outsprinted a
bunch of maiden two-year-olds and her
owner took over $10,(*0 out of the ring.
The play was reserved for the last mo
ment, when the price was forced down
from 15 to 5 and 6. Second all the way to
El Sonoro, Johnny Woods gave Argot a
severe Bhaking up at the paddock, land
ing first by a neck. The show fell to
Roundhead, Installed favorite because of
Bullman having the mount.
The attendance was gt>od and the track
in faster condition than on the opening
day. "Bangor, Andrattus and Redwald
helped the favorite players out.
"Plunger" McManus is still after the
scalp of Sam Hildreth, 1 it looking as if
he could not forget the "boost" given

Bangor entered to be sold for $400 in the
mile and a furlong recital. The horsa
was a 2 to 5 chance and led Castake over
the mark more than a length. "When put
up to be sold McManus bid the chestnut
up to $1500, an additional $3 retaining him
for the stable.
Proceedings began with a five-furlong
dash for maiden two-year-olds. David S,
with Kiley in the saddle, was touted as
"the goods," and in a drive beat Lucera
out a neck. Galanthus, from Jimmy Cof
fey's stable, the post favorite, ran third.
Andrattus, with Dominick up, annexed
the fourth purse. The youngster had a
strong 1 following In the ring and taking
the lead shortly after the start floated in
a third of a dozen lengths before the 50
to 1 shot Picklow.
Mat Storn's useful three-year-old, Su
ne.Ho turned a favorite down In the mile
run, "with 20 to 1 about him in the books.
Wooster Boy enjoyed the call at 5 to 2,
and after leading to within a few yards
of the wire was collared and beaten half
a length by the outsider. Malay received
strong backing, but could not make it.
With clear sailing from the jump Red
wald was never caught in the "Closing
chapter, a six furlong sprint. Sybaris
took the place from Tenny Belle.

Ended Her Life With Acid.
Mrs. Annie Fahey, aged 31 years, drank
carbolic acid in a lodging-house at 317
Third street yesterday evening and died,
from its effects soon afterward. Mrs.
Fahey was divorced from her husband
some time ago and since the separation
has been despondent. Her groans attract
ed the attention of other lodgers in the
house last evening and when her room
was entered she was found writhing in
agrony with an empty carborllc acid bottle
beside her. An ambulance was called, but
she expired before it arrived. The body
was taken to the Morgue by Deputies
Flynn and Smith.- --
ent <of the # Record-Union was perfectly
reliable and that the matter was pre
sented not in malice but as a truthful
I representation. Other matters of a slml
j lar character had been sent by the same
correspondent to the Record-Union but
j had not been published. Mr. Mills also
I said that he knew nothing personally of
I the allegations, but that, knowing the
correspondent, he believed them to be
true. Matters referred to by the Record-
Union took place after he left Paris.
"I am making no war upon the com
missioners." said Mr. Mills, "but will be
yon left Paris on July 6 "and never came
back, and the question is raised what
he did for his salary of $5000 and for the
$4000 or $5000 of expenses drawn from th*
treasury of the State." .
A charge. Is also made in the article
that, while Gasklll has been drawing a
salary of $600 per month, he has been
putting In his time eecuring an agency
for a French champagne, some of the
champagne which he has sold to th-3
commissioners and also to himself and
paid for the same with the money of the
State. He is also represented to have
spent considerable time In London en
deavoring to get the agency for Bass' ale.
Then there is an allegation that the Sac
ramento River Salmon Packers' Associa
tion was turned down with a silver medal
and the Alaska Packers' Association was
given a gold medal, the decision of the
judges being reversed because of pressure
brought to bear by Commissioner Foots
and Secretary Gaskill, although the Alas
ka company "was outside of their Juris
diction."
Commissioner Truman is also . repre
sented as saying that Gasklll is seeking to
delay the report, of the commission so
that he can take several months and draw
more pay and also to delay It so that it
cannot be reached by the next Legisla
ture. The statements concerning the
champagne and Bass' ale agencies are
attributed in the letter to Commissioner
Truman. Incidentally the statement la
made that the commissioners have been
having a cat and dog time abroad. Run
yon and Foote running things and "Tru
man sitting in the gallery looking on."
W. H. Hills is the editor of the Record-
Union. Concerning the article in his pa
per Mr. Mills said yesterday that it was
published under the "direction of the
managers of the paper at Sacramento and
that the paper was entirely responsible
j for anything that it published. All that
I he knew about the facts or -the publlca
! tion of them was that the correspondent
| was known to him and that the opportu
nities of the correspondent for knowing
the facts were first class. No error would
occur in his work by reason of any lack
of information, for he had an Intimate
connection with all matters referred to
in the article.
Mr. Mills also said that the correspond-
COMMISSIONERS TO PARIS
EXPOSITION UNDER FIRE
Are Sharply Criticized for the Manner in Which
They Disbursed State Funds.
There may be fun In certain quarters
when the California, commissioners to the
Paris Exposition return. A letter pub
lished in the Sacramento Record-Union
from Paris accuses two of them and also
their secretary of various offenses. It Is
alleged that out of $130,000 appropriated
by the State at least $75,00) has been ex
pended in salaries: that Varney Gaskil!
had his salary raised from $200 to $COJ
per month and that Commissioner Run-
pleased to see a detailed statement and
classification of the expenses because I
am thoroughly persuaded, from personal
observation, that the money appropriated
by the State was disproportionate to the
exhibit made by the commissioners In
Paris. When I first learned that the com
missioners would not make an exhibit for
California I stated in a published inter
view that the best course to pursue would
be not to draw the appropriation at all.
The result of the exhibit made by the
California commissioners In Paris dow
not justify a retraction of that state
ment."
open disregard of the orders of the Court
of Appeals has done much to help along
tho feeling of distrust. When the writ of
supersedeas arrived in Nome Judge Noyes
was heard to say, so it is alleged. "Our
company made a great mistake not to
have had some one to look after the San
Francisco end of this litigation; if it
had these writs would never have been
issued." It was not until then that the
Judge was supposed to have any Interest
whatever in the company. And then peo
ple began to talk when he referred to
"our" opponents and "our" antagonists
whenever he had reason to speak of the
miners who were fighting for their claims.
And he was heard to say, too, when the
writ came to Nome, so it is declared, that
Judge Morrow had nothing to say In the
matter, and he was ably backed in this
cpinion by Hubbard, the secretary of the
Alaska Mining Company, who Is reported
to have said: "What do we care for Mor
row anyway. What does he amount to?
Noyes is the Czar up here. He is the one
who will look out for us."
And when Noyes was bemoaning the
fact that no one had been retained to look
out for the "San Francisco end," he did
not know that a mission of James Gallen.
United States Commissioner and a
brother-in-law of Senator Carter, had
borne fruit. As soon as it was known
that an appeal from the decision of Judge
Noyes would be sought. Gallen left Nome
and the next thing was the employment
of Gunn of the firm of Kellogg, Davis &
Gunn to look out for the "San Francisco
end." And soon after a telegram came
from Senator Davis in Washington say
ing, "I have seen our people here and they
are all right and everything here will be.
all right."" The "Washington end had been
looked after, too.
The litigation under way here includes
but a few of the claims which have come
under the notice and the litigations of the
Alaska Gold Mining Company. Just as the.
St. Paul sailed news came from, Topkuk,
a place sixty miles down the coast from
Nome, that a receiver was working one
of the richest claims in that region. The
claim was about to be .opened up when
one of the residents there was approached
with the offer of the receivership of the
mine if he would divide. He declined* and
did not get the place. It was not known
to any but the Insiders at the time that
there was to be a receiver, but one was
put in, a man named Cameron, who was
a friend of McKenzie. Within an hour
after the appointment was made a barge
loaded' with mining machinery was sent
down the coa3t to Topkuk, and the ma
chinery which It carried was marked
"Alexander McKenzie. Nome." McCor
mick went down to -work the machinery,
and he took with him twenty or thirty
men. The owners of the property offered
to give a bond; they offered to work the
mine themsel-wes and turn Irs all the dust
they took out of It to the court; they pro
posed that if the plaintiffs won they would
turn over all the dust, not reserving even
what they had paid out for the working
of the mine, but to all these propositions
a deaf ear was turned. The mine is being
run by the receiver, and there is no repre
sentative of the owners to say a word as
to how It shall be run.
In all there are more than five hundred
suits filed by squatters and Jumpers, and
more than one hundred receivers have
been appointed. The receivers are almost
to a man friends of McKenzie, and in the
cases of the richest mines he himself is
the lucky man.
Those who have come from Nome de
clare tha{ the legal tactics practiced and
allowed are ruining the country. A man
dare not admit that he Is getting an ounce
of gold from the ground, for if he does he
will have his claim under a receivership
at once. The aim of the company, it is
declared, is to freeze the miners out by
tormenting them with the law's delays or
to force them to compromise, much to the
profit of the company. The Jumpers are
doing a rushing business, and the pros
pect for service for the troops Increases
with every new claim Jumped or receiver
appointed. .
McKenzie was brought to this city by
Deputy United States Marshals Shelly
Monckton and George H. Burnham at
8:30 o'clock last evening. He was allowed
the freedom, of an ordinary passenger
The accused receiver towered high above
the officers, his big frame and broad
shoulders making him appear like a verit

McKenzie Is a fine specimen of man
hood and is a picture of health. He has
a well rounded face with a heavy neatly
trimmed dark mustache. He wore a
heavy black silk-lined overcoat and black
derby and carried a cane and valise.
At Oakland the officers were met by
Chief I>eputy Ferrlsh. who relieved Burn

over night.

This ended the fight In Nome, and mar

oner took the steamer for San Francisco.
The getting away was not so easy as it
might have been, however, for "William H.
Metson, who was fighting the legal bat
tles of the Pioneer Company, / was
warned that he would not be allowed to
leave the city, and Sam Knight, who was
with him, was cited to appear for con
tempt of court for having procured an af
fidavit from a man named . Reese which
contained the statement that Reese . had
given Noyes $2000,; in consideration of
which Noyes was not to appoint a re
ceiver in his case. It was claimed that
the statement was false and that Knight
knew it, and that therefore he ' was In
contempt. Knight was missing when
the steamer time came, however, and a
diligent search of all the steamers In port
failed to bring him forth. But when the
St. Paul was well out in the ocean and on
her way home, a small boat- crossed her
path and a man in it hailed her. It was
Knight. A- rope was thrown to him and
he climbed aboard. Metson sent word to the
court that he was going home on the St
Paul and that if he was wanted he would
have to be sent for, but he was not
molested.
And while this was being done in the
town, a force of armed men went up to
the claims, and gave, the men working
there for the receiver fifteen minutes
to leave.' The order < was obeyed.
And at the courthouse a motion
was being made that the bonds of
the receiver be made larger. It was
pointed out that he had charge of hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in gold dust
and property, and his bonds were but
$5000, but Judge Noyes refused to raise
them and the air of . the courtroom was
blue with the arguments and the plain
statements of fact that went from the
bar to the bench. â¢
There was $30,000 that belonged to
Charles D. Lane; there was $113,000 that
belonged to the Pioneer Company and
$40,000 that belonged to the Andersons, be
sides much more belonging to other
claims. The Lane gold was $10,000 short
and the Pioneer gold was $15,000 short.
McKenzie was charged, with the. shortage
and he admitted that there was a deficit,
but he declared that when he arrived in
San Francisco he would Â¦ make It good.
The gold was taken -from the vaults
where it had rested and was stored in the
vaults of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, to await the outcome of the litiga
tion, i - "â¢
When he was asked for the keys of the
vault. where the gold was stored. McKen
zie said he had given them to Joseuh
Woods, the United States : Marshal Â¦ for
Nome. "Woods was asked for them in the
name of the writ, and he refused to give
them up. He was told that if he did not
the vault would be broken open, but still
he refused, adding to his refusal threats
that there would be bloodshed if such an
attempt was made; threats in which Mc-
Kenzie heartily joined. But nothing
daunted the miners and their friends
sought the vault and with axes and bars
they broke into the safe and then
knocked the hinges off the boxes until
the whole gleaming pile was disclosed.
Under the circumstances there could
not be much done, on the clafms and it
gave time to the miners to wa'jch the liti
gation and tho stormy scenes that fol
lowed its course. The whole town of
Nome turned out to see the; men from
the Pioneer Mining Company .break open
the boxes of gold in the s*.fe deposit
vaults and carry the nuggets away. This
was done after the order for the arrest of
McKenzie came up from here. The gold
had been located by a stratajem of the
miners, and from the time it vas located
an armed guard watched over It for fear
that It would be taken away. Then when
the order for the arrest of, McKenzie
came, the company and Its retainers an
nounced that they were going to have
that gold. The writ of supersedeas had
not seemed sufficient to the military au
thorities, but the order for the arrest
was, so they said the miners could go
ahead.
ers arrived in Nome on July 21 last. It
was a Saturday. The following Monday
the company got to work and the court
appointed McKenzie receiver of several
valuable properties. â¢ There was no notice
in any of these cases. But the work of
the company did not btop there. "Within
a few days more than one hundred suits
had been filed, all traceable to the com
pany and all of the same character. Some
one claimed he had located before the
owner and he wanted a receiver appointed
to look out for the property until his
rights could be determined. It- did not
take a month to raise a crop of receivers
one hundred strong and more, but with
their advent came the ugly rumor that
if the offers of compromise that were
continually flying round were accepted
there would be no receiver. It is known
where men compromised and went free;
it Is also known that men refusec to com
promise and were entertaining a receiver
before the words had grown cold upon
their lips. The offers were not always
definite, but they were available, and p
man had only to say he was veiling and
he was let alone.
It Is becoming that his greatness should be
mentioned In this presence, because his was
One cf his last official acts In the Xlnth Cir
cuit, where he had so long presided, was to
assist In the organization of this court. It
Is proper that his likeness should be preserved
In the place where the duties of the court
are performed, to the end that those of the bar
who come after us may know how this great
man looked, and whose decisions they will do
well to study and to follow.
Justice Field was blest with a long life,
going to his grave "in a full age like aa a
shock of corn cometh in Its season."
His greatest work was done during the re
construction period which followed our unfor
tunate and ever to be regretted civil war. The
mighty questions which he was then brought
to consider were hardly less Important or diffi
cult than those which taxed the genius of a
Marshall. The masterly manner in which he
grappled end elucidated those great national
problems will ever excite the admiration and
wonder of mankind. But what most redounds
to his glory In this regard Is the noble charity
which he exhibited In the performance of thoee
Judicial duties. That brutal precept "vac vic
tls" found no lodgment in his reason or his
heart. And while many, hot from the recent
conflict, murmured and railed against the mer
dful rule by which he tempered the harshness
of laws enacted during the season of bitterness
and strife, he had the clear vision to 6ee then,
what we all rejoice In seeing now, that this
nation was again to become strong, happy and
reunited, and that it was the policy of the law,
as well as of wisdom and the highest and
noblest attributes of Justice, to hasten rather
than postpone that glad fruition.
The great distinguishing trait of his char
acter was absolute courage. Ills bitterest
enemy never charged Judge Field with coward-
Ice. Among the scenes of violence and blood
shed which unhappily too often shadowed the
early days of California he was frequently
put to the test and never flinched or wavered.
By this quality, as well as his intellectual su
periority, his fellow men were brought to re
gard him with respect and awe. Divested of
the ermine of his office, he was affable and
pleasing to his friends and kind and consid
erate to those about him. He was generous
to all in the humbler walks of life and mind
ful of their needs. He was known and hon
ored to an especial degree by the colored peo
ple of "Washington, by reason of his watch
ful regard for their lights, and their respect
for him on this account grew to reverence
during- his declining years.
Ftrengthen and embellish his Judicial monu
ments.
This auspicious occasion should serve not
only to enhance our respect for one whom in
honoring we honor ourselves, but also our
respect and reverence for the science of the
law, which In Its ramifications touches every
interest of mankind and through which so
ciety itself coheres, and which has been made
luminous and strong by the minds of such
men as Justice Field. "We are also reminded
anew of the duty of the bench and bar to
Bee that the law shall be upheld and enforced
and that its equal protection Bhall extend to
the strong and the weak, the poor and the
rich.
The Circuit Court of Appeals gratefully ac
knowledges the presentation of this reminder
of the life and work of a great lawyerâ one
who was a member of this court at the time
of its organization and who will always oc
cupy - a conspicuous place among the distin
guished Jurists of the present century. To
the bench and bar the memory of the life of
Justice Field will always be revived in his
decisions, those models of the clear and stren
uous elucidation of the principles of the com
mon law and of American constitutional law.
Justice Field" s Influence as a Jurist will live,
like that of Mansfield, so long as the admin
istration of the law shall continue among Kng
lish speaking peoples. Centuries hence when
by the wearing waste of time this canvaa may
have turned to dust, his great opinions will
bÂ« considered by the legal profession with an
awe and reverence akin to those with which to
day the followers of Confucius regard his
teachings.
"William B. Gilbert, senior Circuit Judge,
spoke on behalf of the court as follows:
not tho genius to acquire mere wealth, nor
to organize or conduct some one of the stu
pendous worldly enterprises of this age which
by their vastnesa tend to overshadow the work
of the Individual mind, however able, and
threaten the possibilities which have hereto
fore etlmulated individual undertakings ; but
he was master of a great intellectual power
by which he was enabled with unerring view
to ecan and comprehend that almost bound
less region of the law, bo vast that the ordi
nary mind may hope to explore but a limited
portion, and through love of the law â whll6
one of his brother* projected and put In opera
tion an invention for the transmission of in
telligence beneath the waters of the Atlantic
and another attained great eminence as a prac
ticing attorneyâ he gave his life work to his
country in the study of those great questions
which were the burning Issues of his day and
time, and in molding to the ordinary com
prehension those great legal principles by
whose aid those Issues were resolved and upon
which the fabric of our government is founded.
THK litigious contingent came

shut down with the report that they have
been worked out.
The beach !s deserted because the
Golden Sands Mining Company swore out
warrants for all the miners who would
not retreat before it and then when the
company^ took possession its machinery
was fcund to be unsuitable and so the
rich sands are lying untouciied. And at
Topkuk and along the creeks where tho
busy miners once worked hard and lon^
for themselves receivers with scores of
id!e workmen and high-priced machinery
are working the claims, and what is left
of tho gold is being turned into a safe
deposit vault to await the result of liti
gation that will end only in a compromise
or defeat for the miner.
And the most significant fact of the
whole situation is that if a miner will
compromise before suit has Deen filed he
finds himself receiver proof. He may do
as he pleases then and squatters and
claim-jumpers pass him by.
The suit of greatest Importance in the
northern gold fields has transferred itsell
to this city and here it will be fought out
before the Circuit Court of Appeals. It
is the trial of Alexander McKenzie for
contempt of court for having refused to
obey a writ of Bupersedeas Issued out of
the Circuit Court of Appeals command
ing him to deliver to the defendants in an
action In which he was appointed receiver
all property of theirs which was placed
In his charge; and also all the gold dust
he took out of the claims during his un
interrupted receivership. The dust
amounts In value to over $300,000; tho
claims Include some of the richest on tho
famous Anvil Creek.
The % course of the litigation reads like
a romance. It Includes bodies of armed
men seeking by force what the law would
not give them. It Includes threats of
bloodshed, of forcible dispossession and of
wholesale murder, and it ondB with tho
breaking open of a safe deposit vault and
of big boxes of nuggets and carting them
away In the sight of a whole town full
of people, who cheered as they looked on.
The trouble began on July 23 of this
year, yrhen Judge Noyes, the new United.
States District Judge, had been but two
days in Nome, and the first move was tho
appointment of a receiver for the rich
Discovery claim owned by tho Pioneer
Mining Company. There was no notice
to the owners that such a proceeding was
pending. The receiver stepped In and
commenced to run things, and when tho
owners applied to the court they were told
there was a prior claim by one Robert
Chlpps, who settled on the place in 1899,
and also that tho owners were aliens and
therefore were not entitled to ho'.d the
'claims under any circumstances.
It was shown to the court that the own
ers, Undeberg, 'Lindblom and Brynteson,
located the claim in 1838, six month's be
fore Chlpps was in the country, and it was
further shown that Lindblom and Brynte
son were naturalized, one in 1S96 and the
other In 1S9S. The law requires but one of
the locators to be a citizen. Despite these
showings, however, the receiver held pos
session and took out nearly $15,000 every
day from the Discovery claim and those
he had gathered In with It under the same
rulings of court.
An appeal was taken to the Circuit
Court of Appeals in this city and a writ
of supersedeas commanding the receiver
to give up the properties and the gold he
had taken from them -was issued, but
when the writ was received In Nome the
receiver would not obey It and the court
would not enforce it. So it became a
question of physical strength. The own
ers gathered around them a body of ,T>cn
and prepared to retake the claims and
also to wrest the gold from the vaults,
but to this the military officers in charge
of the troops stationed at Nome would not
assent. It would cause bloodshed, they
said, and so the receiver worked on. The
Court of Appeals was sought again and
McKenzie was cited for contempt In hav
ing disobeyed the writ of -the court. Un
der that writ. he was arrested and was
brought here for trial yesterday.
According to tho story of thosÂ© -who
came down from Nome, the gold hunters
are the victims of a conspiracy that may
end in an investigation by the President
and Congress and the ruin of more than
one reputation. The claims are being
gathered in by receivers upon the suits
of jumpers. All are backed by the Alaska
Gold Mining Company, and many of the
Jumpers have been^ proved to be among
its stockholders.
The Alaska Gold Mining Company Is a
corporation formed under the laws of
Arizona and having its office In New Tork
and its principal place of business In
Alaska, A man named McCormick, an old
friend of McKenzie and a resident of
Alaska, Is Its vice president. O. P. Hub
bard of the law firm of Hubbard, Beman
& Hume, Is Its secretary, and Robert
Chlppa, who Jumped the IMscovery claim;
Todd, a banker of New Tork, and Blatch
ford, a lawyer of New York, are among
its directors. Its stock Is curiously dis
tributed. Chlpps has 300,000 shares: Hub
bard has 300,000 more; a man named
Blakesley, of Chicago, has 200,000; Fisher,
Leonard and Kester, who Jumped claims
that the company is now litigating, have
among them 150,000 shaies; a man named
Slade has 300,000 more; a Mrs. Requa, also
one of the plaintiff Jumpers, has 50,000,
and a man named Jacobs, another Jump
er, has 100,000, and there are more who
Jumped and sued and held stock whllfj
the receivers dug the gold from the soil
and the owners fought In the courts and
refused to compromise." The remainder
of the stock is held in the name of Mc-
Kenzie. It was a source of concern to th<3
stockholders that he held the bulk of the
stock until he Is said to have explained
to one of them that he had "to take care"
of some friends of the company, and the
friends he is said to have mentioned are
Senator Carter of Montana, Senator
Hansbrough of North : Dakota. Senator
Davis of Minnesota and Judge Noyes,
the District Judge at Nome.
The Golden Sands Company was formed
of the same people, but there were two
differencesâ It worked the claims along
the beach; the other worked the claims
in the Interior and on the creeks. It
attained possession by arresting the
miners for . trespass and by threatening
arrest; the other uses suits and , receivers
and the slowest processes of the law.

Mr. Pillsbur>' fpoke as follows:
Hay It Please Tour Honor: Responding- to
a request preferred by the San Francisco Bar
Association that the features of her late hus
band should be manifest in some of the court
rooms cf this city, the widow of Stephen John
ccn Field has deputed me to preeent to your
court this portrait of that Jurist, and to ask
Us acceptance as a mark cf her high respect
for the Judfes who constitute this tribunal.
and alto ts a testimonial of her loving memory
tor the xnaa whose face Is delineated upon this
canvas.
In performinj: so pleasing: a duty for this
generous and respected lady, may I be per
mitted your Honors, to say. as a member of
the bar, that it seems to me highly fitting that
the walls of this courtroom should be adorned
by the picture of a man who has done so much
to add luster to the Jurisprudence of our coun
try.
It would b* idle fcr me. ca ruch an occa
sion, to atte*sÂ«ot acy account of the life of this
'. fJrc-u'.^.'i Individual, who will always be
known aruT *. kf n of in this State as "Judge"
Field. Hi* judicial life, first as Alcalde at
Marysvllle fifty years ago, next aa Justice and
later aa Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
the State of California, and last for more thaa
thirty years as a Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States. Is familiar not only to
every lawyer, but to every citizen of this State
possessing the slightest acquaintance with Its
history.
This portrait was j>a-stefl, presumably, about
twenty-five years before his death, when he was
at the lenlth cf his Intellectual vigor and
power and when, aa a member d the highest
court In this landâ than which no other is more
tuRUst or powerful in the wide worldâ hÂ« was
writlr.e thoee wonderful opinions which have
made h!s came Immortal. And while the bar
of the Unlte-3 Etatee, by common consent, gives
to Chief Justice Marshall the first place among-
American Jurists, as Washington stands first
among cur statesmen, I look for no contradic- ;
tion to the statement that amcr.p those who
have come after John Marshall no Jud^e of this
land has displayed greater judicial perception
or Intellectual etrengrth than Stephen Johnson
neld. His powerful mind was enriched to the
highest degree with legal learning:. "Petere
fortes" was his precept and his practice. H>
had diligently threaded the labyrinths of the
law and thoroughly comprehended the philoso
phy underlying that artificial reason which Is
Its life. He Â»aÂ« deeply read In the black-letter
lore of the common law, and from this store
house he drew materials and treasures which
