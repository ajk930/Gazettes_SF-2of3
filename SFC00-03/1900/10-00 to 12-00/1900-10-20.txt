Campbell and Bridge went to Redding
last evening to attend the ball given at
the close of the Odd Fellows' grand en

home of John W. Hare, where they slept
several hours. At 6:30 o'clock they left
Redding and drove rapidly toward
Keswick. Dav was breaking an.l
It was raining hard as they came
to Rock Creek, usually an insignificant
stream, but swollen to a torrent by
the night's hea\-y downpour. There
were no eye-witnesses to the attempt
to ford the creek, but at 8 o'clock
a man' discovered a badly crippled horse
standing at the edsre of the creek, JuÂ»t
below tho ford, with the wreck of a
buggy near by. The horse was recog
nized as the "driving animal of H. D.
Campbell.

Keswick and search parties were organ

miles, to a point where the creek empties

This forecast has been made without regard to the political bias of the newspapers directing it.
The men engaged in the work were instructed to note conditions as they, existed, to cast aside partisan
ship and get at the truth; This they have sought to do, and while the result may make unpleasant reading
for some, it is given in all candor and' honesty and in the belief, strengthened by past experience, that it
is prophetic. * â¢
This'last statement is based upon the knowtedgeof the accuracy of similar, forecasts previously
made under the auspices of the New York Herald.' In 1884 thatpaper predicted the election of Grover
Cleveland, in 1888 the success. of Harrison, in 1892 the second triumph of Cleveland, and in 1896 the
sound money sweep for McXinley. â¢ In conjunction with The Call; this year, the forecast has been even
more thoroughly made, and it is safe to say that what The Call and r Herald foreshadow to-morrow is
foreordained for November 6 next.
The Call will publish to-morrow morning, simultaneously with the New York Herald, a fore
cast of the approaching Presidential election, based_ upon the closest observation in every State in the

a corps of trained political observers. For weeks they have been sifting conditions and preparing estimates
for the purpose of ascertaining for the readers of both newspapers how these States are going on Novem

said of the Pope's thorough ap

States in the Philippines and Cuba, and
added the recognition that In the former
islands the only safety for her property
and priests is found under the protection
of the American flag. "In one of the au
diences which His Holiness granted me,"
said the Archbishop, "the Pope said:
" 'We are well pleased with the relations
of the American Government to the
church in Cuba and the Philippine Islands.
The American Government gives proof of
good will and exhibits In Its acts a
spirit of justice and of respect for the lib
erty and rights of the church. We have
confidence in the intelligence and spirit of
Justice of the American Government, and
believe that the future will not lead us to
a change of sentiment toward It. .Under
the American Government there will be
due respect for the rights of property and
of conscience. You will thank, in my
name, the President of tho republic for
what is being done.'
"Cardinal Secretary Rampolla said: 'The
church needs' in Cuba and in the Philip
pines the co-operation of the American
Government for the protection of Its
rights and v liberties, as indeed the Ameri
can Government needs the co-operation of
the church for the pacification of those
countries.'
"As a plain matter of fact," added the
Archbishop, "the only safety which the
Catholic church at the present time has In
the Philippines for the possession of her
properties and for the lives of her priests
Is the protection afforded by the American
flag, and all this is fully .understood and

LINCOLN, Nebr., Oct. 19.â With pros
perity as his principal topic of discussion.
Senator Hanna traveled through the east-
Upon the Issues of the Day.
Talks to tb,e People of Nebraska
SENATOR HANNA'S TOUR.
Senator Hanna was then driven to the
Auditorium. He spoke for about twenty
minutes, discussing Industrial conditions
for the most part. He received an ova
tion when he concluded and the crush to
shake hands with him was again so great
that the police had to clear the way to the
carriage. ,
From the Auditorium Senator Hanna
was driven to the Lindell Hotel, where he
spoke for about five minutes. Here again
there was much confusion and hisses and
shouts for Bryan mingled with cheering.
Senator Hanna then referred to Mr.
Bryan's alleged reference to him as a
'â¢'labor crusher," made first during his
Senatorial campaign in 1597. and con
tinued:
"I want to remind every man that a
man who in a contest will drag an honor
able name into the mire for the sake of
making votes is not worthy to be consid
ered for the high office of President of the
United States, and I.. believe there arc
thousands of people in the State of Ne
braska who resent it as an insult to their
Intelligence and their ideas of fair play
and justice: because when a man has the
opportunity through newspapers or
through the public rostrum to make
charges too trifling to be denied, and
those charges go undented and enter into
the minds of the people whom the man so
charged has no opportunity to convince
any man who will use those tactics to fur
ther his own selfish ambition is not fit- to
be constable."
"In regard to that statement," Senator
Hanna said, "before an audience in Lin
coln, I want to hurl It back in his teeth
and tell him it is as false as hell. When
It comes to personalities I am willing to
stand before the American people 1 on my
record as a business man and let him
stand on his. I have been in business
forty years; I am employing 6000 men, pay
the highest wages, treat them like men,
and they all respect me, and when Mr.
Bryan or. any other man charges upon me
âand I am willing to appropriate it all, as
I am chairman of the board of man
agers of this Republican campaignâ with
any such methods as those. I propose, as
I said, to hurl it back and denounce him
as a demagogueâ In his own town."
Shortly after 8 o'clock the parade
formed and amid a blaze of flambeaus and
fireworks Senators Hanna and Victor Dol
llver were escorted to the Oliver House.
Senator Frye going to the Auditorium.
When Senator Hanna was introduced he
was received with a roar of applause.
Senator Hanna spoke at some length, tak
ing up the silver and anti-imperialist
issues, and finally referred to the charges
which Mr. Hanna said had recently been
made by Mr. Bryan that the Republican
campaign managers had entered upon ex
tensive bribery in order to secure the elec
tion of the Republican ticket.
Escorted by the Lincoln Traveling: Men's
Marching Club 'anil several uniformed
marching organizations. Senators Hanna
and Frye were escorted from their train
to the Lincoln Hotel. Immediately after
dinner Senator Hanna. standing on the
balcony of the . hotel, shook hands for
some time with the crowds that filed Dy.
So great was their number that Senator
Hanna was finally compelled to beat a re
treat.
The first of the two days' speechmaking
in Nebraska by Senators Hanna and Frye
culminated to-night In three big meetings
here, including an outdoor â¢ meeting in
front of the Lincoln Hotel. Only two
meetings had been planned for, but so tre
mendous were the crowds that attempted
to force their way into the Opera-house
and the Auditorium to hear Senator,
Hanna that he was finally asked to ad
dress an overflow meeting from the bal
cony of the hotel. Excursion trains were
run into Lincoln from many points in
Eastern and Central Nebraska and the
parade which took place to-night included
a dozen of the town uniformed marching
clubs, among them several -women's or
ganizations.
said Senator Hanna In his speech
at the Oliver House in Lincoln to-niKht. In
referring to W. J. Bryan. In his speech,
which was one of the lengthiest delivered
in his present tour, Senator Hanna bit
terly denounced Mr. Bryan for what he
termed "his attempts to slander me in my
own State." This 13 Bryan's home town,
and the speech of Senator Hanna was re
ceived with mingled cheers and hisses.
LINCOLN, Nebr. Oct. 19.â "A man
who knowingly or unknowingly will
circulate slanders about another
man Is not fit to be a constable,"
At North Bend Mr. Hanna was present
ed with a big bunch of flowers by a dele
gation of little glrla.
. "There Is another side to this question,
that of patriotism. As long as our dead
lie burled In the Philippines, as long as
our brothers and fathers lie in that soil,
anybody who attempts to haul the flag
down will be snowed under. They say
that there Is another side to this question.
They call It commercialism. My friends,
lfjlt Is commercialism to want the pos
session of a strategic point, giving the
American people an opportunity. to main
tain a foothold in the markets of that
Eastern country, for God's sake let us
have commercialism."
"I have heard that you have a candidate
for the Presidency living In your State."
said Mr. Hanna, amid laughter, "and that
he has got it bad. so bad that he ia will-
Ing to sacrifice all the material interests
of this country In order that he may at
tain the height of his amtition. Now, my
friends, you are not called upon to exer
cise the prerogative of your votes to sat
isfy the ambition of any man, but you
are called upon to consider your own In
terests and the interests of your country
first."
In, briefly discussing the question of im
perialism, Mr. Hanna said:
. A big audience greeted Mr. Hanna at
Norfolk, the street being packed for al
most a block from the speaking stand
Prosperity as the issue was then debated
by Mr. Hanna for five minutes. The
farmers composing the audience cheered
him until the train was far from the sta
tion.
"Oh, I am not so dangerous as e*i that,"
said he, laughingly, pointing to the ban
ner.
"Populist farmers, beware! Chain your
children to yourselves or put *em tinder
the bed. Mark Hanna Is In town.**
At Wlnslde. a little hamlet in the midst
of the corn country, Mr. Ilanna saw tho
following banner as he stepped out on the
car platform:
"What we want to consider is what is
best fcr our personal interests. All you
want to do is to let well enough alone."
"There is no time for the people of this
country to say anything to any set of
politicians which attempts to raise a bogy
man to scare the timid," said Mr. Hanna..
At "Wayne, Â¦where the audience was
made up mostly of farmers, he said:
The nrst stop in Nebraska was at Em
erson, where a good-sized crowd gave tho
Senator a warm greeting. At WakenelU
two brass bunds were at the station, but
their music was almost drowned by tho
terrific din caused by a gang of grain
shovelera, who pounded the Immense
scoops with clubs and shouted for Hanna.
Here Senator Hanna addressed the crowd
in a big tent put up near the station.
"You men. better than any one else."
said he, "know what the continuation oÂ£
the present conditions means to this coun

I have no doubt which way you will de

Sioux City was the first stop to-day.

"This is a g-overnment controlled by
great political parties, the respective or
gans of which' are formed and maintained
by those who largely agree upon certain
policies of administration, but it is not ex
pected.. nor is It practicable, that such
parties will' at all times," fully and accu
rately, represent the sentiments of every
Individual member, tit Is sufficient that
pome leading principles In which a citizen
believes are advocated by the party with
Â¦which he is associated, to Justify his sup
port of that party, regardless . of its atti
tude on subordinate questions which he
may or may not approve. He need not in
dorse every line or plank of a platform In
order to maintain his orthodoxy.
"A different policy would disintegrate
jrreat parties and create factions without
number. Majorities must control In politi
cal parties as well as in governments. The
question after all Is not one of mere con
stituencyâwhich Is never a vital matter
but whether one's own political party as
a whole better represents one's sentiments
than the opposition party, and the solu
tion of that problem must always be de
termined by the elector himself, according
to his own best Judgment.
"It Is submitted that It is the duty of
every Democratic citizen everywhere to
eupport the nominations of the party, reg
ularly and fairly made, even though some
party policies may not nrvt their entire
approval. I am reasonably sure that the.
platform of no other party will suit Demo
crats as well as the platform of their own
P*rtjr.
"While my personal views of certain
portions of the reaffirmed platform may
not have been changed, particularly as to
their wisdom and expediency, it does not
follow that either honor, duty or con
sistency requires me to withhold my act
ive co-operation in electing the ticket
Â¦which was fairly and regularly nominat

"If there existed no reason it is be
lieved that a sense of common danger to
our free institutions, now being imper

verearlef, has cemented the Democracy

"I make no apologies to any one for my
activity and interest in this campaign. I
participated in the convention at Kansas
City which framed the platform and nom

treated me with courtesy from the com

and as an honorable man I was bound to

David B. Hill of New York. A
great number of people were unable to
get into the armory and for their benefit
several outdoor speeches were made by
local orators. "When Mr. Hill arrived at
the armory, accompanied by Mayor Car
ter H. Harrison, he was given a magnifi

Mr. Hill, calling forth a prolonged out
burst of applause. It was fully five min

Senator HOI eaid in pait:
CHICAGO. Oct. 19â An audience of
5000 people crowded the Second
Regiment armory to-night to lis
ten to an address by ex-Senator
At Binghamton, where Mr. Bryan had
the largest and most enthusiastic audi
ence of the day, special notice was- made
of the fact tnat some of the manufactur
ing plants of that city were close.
The day was rendered Interesting by a
spirited meeting at Auburn, the home
during his lifetime of Secretary Seward,
and Mr. Bryan's pointed reference in his
speech there to the manager, of an im
portant manufacturing enterprise at that
point which he evidently intended should
have greater than . local application.
Speeches were also made during the day
at Cortland, Binghamton and at sev
eral other points. The day's work closed
with a meeting at Rochester late to
night. The meetings to-day were gen
erally well attended, and those at Ithaca
and Binghamjon were especially targe.
Probably the Binghamton meeting was
the most enthusiastic of the day. In all
instances except at the beginning of the
Ithaca meeting close attention was given
to the speeches.
Mr. Bryan's speech at Cortland was
addressed almost wholly to the farmers
and he there expressed the opinion that
one person out of a hundred was bene
fited by Republican policies. He pleaded
to hJs auditors to throw off the yoke of
partisanship and assert their Indepen
dence. He declared that the farmers
were e\ery year owing more and owning
less of the wealth they create.
The young men who were below re
sponded to these signals with cries and
yells, and they also asked numerous
questions while the speech was in pro
gress. Evidently, too, quite a large per
centage of the students were in sympathy
with Mr. Bryan, and some of them
shouted lustily for him when his replies
to the questions of their fellows were
especially to their liking-. Mr. Bryan was
generally voted to have met the occasion
successfully and that he did so was evi
denced by the fact that the interruptions
grew fewer and farther apart as the
speech proceeded and at last ceased alto
gether.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., Oct. 19.â William J.
Bryan, the Democratic standard bearer,
to-day experienced his second encounter
of the campaign with college students. It
occurred at Ithaca, and the students were
from Cornell University. The incident
was not so exciting as that at Ann Arbor,
Mich., for the Ti-ason that the young men
were not so persistent and did not work
in such unison, but there was one feature
of interest which was not noticeable at
Ann Arbor. This was the participation
of young women in the affair. A hundred
or more members of the fair sex were
stationed at windows in the high school,
just back and over the stage from which
Mr. Bryan spoke, and they disturbed the
proceedings to as great an extent as they
could by lowering posters bearing a
picture of President McKinley so as to
attract the attention of the crowd.

"It Is an issue which cannot be ignored;
it cannot be ridiculed; it cannot be sup

"President McKinley says there is no
such issue and yet he devoted the gr \ter
part of his extended letter of acceptance
in antagonizing it. Senator Depew scouts
the idea of any danger to the country
from what he calls 'American imperial
ism,' and occupies half of his time in his
public speeches in endeavoring to per
suade his hearers that they ought to tol
erate it. Governor Roosevelt, recently
'promoted* to the Vice Presidential nomi
nation through the disinterested effort?
or Senators Platt and Quay, gives nearly
all of his attention in his public utterances
to the discussion of this topic.
"It is the one subject which has largely
engrossed popular interest since th-* -tay
the nominations of each party were le.
The Interest in It intensifies as the ctrn
paign progresses. Like Banquo's ghost, it
will not down.
"The thoughtful citizen anxious to dis
charge his duty at the approaching elec
tion not only requires what is the most
important issue Involved to which he
should give his careful consideration but
without deprecating the importance of the
questions of trusts, finances, monetary
reform, taxation, centralization, govern
ment by injunction, home rule, economics
and other questions worthy of attention,
it was believed that the vital question of
this campaign was whether our form of
governwent was to be preserved In all its
simplicity and integrity. It is called, in
brief, the issue of 'imperialism.' In other
words, it Is the issue of a republic versus
an empire.

NEW YORK, Oct., 19.â An officer of the
Newport Yacht Club said to-day there
would be a new boat built to defend the
America's cup and that the Herreshoffs
would be the builders.-
This is the first positive declaration that
has been made In this' important matter.
It was not told' whether the new yacht
would be owned by an Individual or a
syndicate, but an announcement Indicat
ing, the. steps taken In the proper defense
of the old trophy will probably be made
at the regular meeting of the club to be
held on the evening of Thursday, October
25.
This will be welcome news, not only to
the yachtsmen, but to the public gener
ally. , Leading members ot/the yachting
community have hoped for the announce
ment ever since it was known that Sir
Thomas Llpton had determined to send
his second challenge; They were sure it
would be difficult to defeat the Columbia
if she had again to defend . the' cup, but
felt it would be taking chances and that
the prize should not thus be endangered
It will now be left with the Herreshoffs
to produce aboat that is faster than the
Columbia. These builders have, perhaps
reached the limit of lightnesB and safety
in the matter" of spars and rigging, but
it is to be found out If they have reached
these limits In the matter' of hull con
struction.

to win $440,000 if Bryan is elected.
How much cash. Louis Wormser has at
stake belonging to himself no one knows.

Bryan men. The -largest amount risked
was $12,000 against S50.000 on McKinley.
Several bets were Involved in the sum,
but the names of the principals were

a wager between Jacob Field and "Jack"
McDonald, a bookmaker, believed to be
8oting for Richard Croker, was posted
Â¦with Bell & Co. to-day. Mr. Field said
he thought Mr. McDonald had made the
VHger in his own behalf.
"I am a strong believer, tn McKinley,"
said Mr. Field. So sure am I of Repub
lican success that ? will wager $300,000 at
4 to 1 that Bryan will be defeated. His
recent speeches have been so full of anar

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â So shrewd a pol

edge of betting has been acquired in a
practical school, is generally believed in
Wall street to have misjudged the trend

reason given for Mr. Kruger's hurried embarkation on the, steamer Gelderland is that he
feared the Boers here would attack him. The feeling of the refugees against Mr. Kruger for flee

nied by Dr. Haimann, the Governor following in a private carriage. The party drove through the
custom-house and embarked from'the customs pier instead of from the passenger jetty. It is re

4. My speech delivered at St. Louis the lath
of Sfotember on the trust question.
These documents have already been widely
published in the press of the country and the
members of your party are fully informed in
recarrt to my views on the questions covered.
In 1SS6 the money question was the question
of paramount importance, but the Republican
party.: by its disregard of the principles of our
republic and by its advocacy of policies repug
nant to the doctrines of self-government, has
left us no choice but to summoo all lovers of the
Declaration of Independence to the defense of
that sacred document and the constitution
framed in accordance with it.
Xn your letter you quote several appropriate
extracts from Lincoln's speeches. I find In a
tpeech by Lincoln in 1S53 a defense of the
Declaration of Independence, accompanied by
a fervent and patriotic appear to his country
men not to abandon the principles therein
enunciated. It is so applicable to the present
time and so in harmony with the references
you have made to Lincoln's words that I quote
the . followlns extract:
"Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught
doctrines conflicting with the great landmarks
of the Declaration of Independence, if you have
listened to suggestions which would take away
from its grandeur and mutilate the fair sym
metry of its proportions, if you have been In
clined to believe that all men are net created
eÂ«ual in those inalienable rights enumerated
by onr chart of liberty, let me entreat you to
come back. Return to the fountain whose
waters spring close by the blood of the revolu
tion. Think nothing of me; take no thought
for the political fate of any man whomsoever,
but come back to the truths that are in the
Declaration of Independence. You may do any
thinc with me you choose If you will but heed
these sacred principles. You may not only de
feat mÂ« for the Senate, but you may take me
and put me to death. While pretending no in
difference to earthly honors, I do claim to be
actuated in this contest by something htgher
than an anxiety for office. I charge you to
drop every paltry and insignificant thought for
any man's success. It is nothing; I am noth
ing: Judge Douglass is nothing. But do not
destroy that Immortal emblem of humanity-
the Declaration of American Independence.
How harsh thÂ» contrast between the lofty
sentiments "expressed by Lincoln and the sor
did mercenary appeal now made to the people
by 'the Republican party. How great the
chasm between the statesmanship which would
sacrifice life itself in defense of that immortal
document which has been the model of repub
lics ever since it was promulgated and the
commercialism which woold sacrifice everr
noble and holy purpose in pursuit of new mar
kets and would indorse the doctrine that trade
can be purchased with human bloodâ a doc
trine advanced by those who want to give syn
dicates a chance to exploit distant colonies.
In response to the hope which you express,
permit me to assure you that my political obli
gations are due entirely to the plain people,
who ask no special privileges at the hands of
the government, but demand only equality of
rlchts and opportunity to enjoy life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness under the flag of a
republic. These people, the nation s wealth
Drodueers In time of peace and the nation s
warriors in time of war. have already done
more for me than I can i ever repay. Whether
I am elected or not, it shall be my ambition to
Drotect their rights and advance their interest*
by every means within my power. Very truly
yours, r# J* BRTAJJ.

BRYAN'S LETTER
TO SILVERITES
Mr Bryan has claimed to be apainM trusts.
ret Mr Bryan's own manager. Senator Jones.
iÂ« not only" the chief lÂ«-iK-nciary of the cotton
bale trust but he nuibbln- about it and says
it is not a trust. Mr. Ilryan was the Â£U<-st of
Mr Oukor In New Tork. and if he is corr^ct-
Jv quoted, say* Mr. Croker is the great^t
nian In tbe world and Tammany Hall the

Nov.- understand me. I do not enter Into

the ice trust not only from the character of
the commodity in which it deals, but from its
connection with the lea<itn K local politicians,
can iiroiKTly Â»-Â» denounced as iniquitous. Still.
I havr no question that there are plenty of falr
ly h^net-t men who have gone into these trusts
fimply as a business matter, as they would go
into arv corporation, but what 1 want to em
t.hasizo is the utter hypocrisy of ueitur another
tru*t as a party shibboleth in the Bryanized
IVmiKTary when the prominent leaders of that
party have private ownership in the very trusts
which they ostentatiously denounce.
' Mr Bryan U maklnK even.- effort to carry

We have often been told that Mr. Bryan
must be ppnloned for his crude and raw
theories of finance and economics and even for
Mf aidinr and abetting the Malay bandits
who are shooting down our Koldlers in the
Philippines, uiv.n the ground that he has good
intentions; that he is sincere in his denuncia
tion of wrong. I do not see how such a claim
can t>e uret-d by e gueFt of the Tammany
Democracy, one of the foundations of which is
b'ackmai'lr.g the protected vice and infamy
that in New Yoik City flourishes with hideous
rar.kness undrr Tammany's control.' Mr.
Croker Is trying to help Mr. Bryan to na
tional euceeys, which would mean the deepest
Ftain ur>on our financial honor at home, the
deepest stain on the honor of our flag abroad.
In return he is trying to help Mr. Croker to

sparks of courage he would return nere
and help Youtsey out of this trouble if
any of the witnesses had lied on Youtsey;
that If Taylor had even only one spark
of manhood he would now commit- suicide
under the whip of his conscience. He said
if Arthur Goebel had told an untruth as
to what Youtsey told him then Goebel
was a worse man than the one who as
sassinated William Goebel. He . cited
many incidents as told by other witnessed
that corroborated what Youtsey told Goe
bel, and said ex-Governor Bradley's ab
.^*nce as a witness practically corrobo
rated Culton's testimony as to Youtsey,
for if Culton did not have a talk wltu
Bradley then he ought to be willing to go

For several years i^ucalyptol. Gualacot

standard remedies for, catarrhal troubles,
but they have always been given separate-
ly and only very recently Â«n Ingenious
chemist succeeded In combining them, to-
gether with other antiseptics. Into a pleas-
ant, effective tablet.
Druggists sell the remedy under tha
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and it
has met -with remarkable success In thÂ©
cure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and
throat catarrh and In- catarrh of tho
stomach.
Mr F. N. Benton, whose address Is cars

I run up against anything that Is good I
Ilka to tell people of It. 1 have beÂ«>n
troubled with catarrh more or less for
some time. Last winter more than ever.
Tried several so-called. cures, but did not
get any benent from them. About six
weeks ago I bought a 50-cent box of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and I am glad
to say that they have done wonders for

Mr. Geo. J. Casanova of Hotel Griffon,

A leading physician of Pittsburgr advises
the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets la
preference to any other treatment for
catarrh of the head, throat or stomach.
He claims they are far superior to In-
halers, salves, lotions or powder, and ara
much more convenient and pleasant to
take and are so harmless that little chil-

tain no opiate, cocaine or any polaonaua

CHINESE EMPEROR'S MESSAGE.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct.
19.â In the illumination of Rus
sia's attitude the authorities see
a promise of a satisfactory solu
tion of the Chinese problem. M. de Wol
lant Russian Charge d' Affaires here, said
to-night that there couJd be no doubt
about Russia's good intentions with re
spect to China.
"Russia made formal declarations of lier
aims to the powers." he continued, "when
on August 29 her diplomatic representa
tives, in accotdance with instructions re
ceived from St. Petersburg, repeated that
she had no territorial designs on China;
that her purpose was to act with the
ether powers in establishing the safety of
the foreign legations in Peking, and aid
the Chinese Government in .suppress'ng
disorder. Her occupation of Manchuria
was solely for defensive purposes, and as
soon as the restoration of order is accom
plished troops will be withdrawn. There
Is no necessity for continued military oc
cupation of Peking, and Russia in her
declaration of policy announced her Inten
tion to withdraw her forces, which she
has done. It is my opinion that peace can
be more promptly restored and the entire
question more expedltiously settled If Pe
king Is evacuated."
"\N 1th the United States, Russia and
Franco opposed to dismemberment it is
unlikely that any other power will at
tempt to seize territory-
An official who Is deeply Interested in
seeing the territorial entity of the empire
preserved made this statement: "There
are two nations whose policy in China
must be sharply watched. One is Ger
many, the other Is Russia. The former
will attempt to take territory by brute
force, the other will oppose such a policy.
It will also object to the entrance of Ger
many into Northern China, and it will use
its best efforts to make a peaceful solu
tion possible. And when peace has been
restored Russia will say to China: 'We
would like this bit of territory in tho
north. You have a great deal. We showed
our friendship for you when you were in
trouble. We withdrew our troops and
made every effort to restore peace. Now
why not give us this when we ask so lit
tle?'
"And China," concluded this gentleman,
"will say yes: This was the policy pur
sued subsequent to the Japanese war, and
it secured Port Arthur and Talien Wan
and grave Russia control of Manchuria."
This expression of opinion shows that
Russia's motives are still suspected by
some. Tho powers that are not in accord
with the principles which have guided the
Czar's Government in negotiations regard
ing China have not been inactive, and they
have evidently succeeded in creating the
belief in some quarters that Russia has
ulterior designs at variance with her pro
fessions.
It can be stated, however, that Russia's
course from the beginning of the trouble
ha.s been in harmony with her professions
and there 1b no reason to suspect that they
will be otherwise.
It is apparent to diplomats here that
Russia will not attempt to force Japan
into war. The relations of those two gov
ernments seem to be improving and are
likely to continue to do so, as Japan un
derstands Russia's purpose tovdeal with
the Chinese question In an open and
straightforward manner.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 19.â Attorney J. Marlon
Brooks of Los Angeles, one of the counsel
defending Pugilist "Jack" Ortega, is ac
cused of passing a'worthless cneck on F.
Kayser, proprietor of the Russ House.
Brooks has mado his home at the hotel
for a couple of weeks. In the complaint
Kayser alleges that yesterday "Brooks
presented a J75 check drawn on the Co
lumbian Banking Company of San Fran
cisco in payment of his board. The check
was apparently indorsed by the banking
company, stating that Brooks had suffi
cient funds to meet the payment of the
cftuk. Kayser deducted $11 for board and
gave Brooks JW in coin. The Columbian
l'ank was communicated with yesterday
and declared the check worthless, as
Brooks hod no funds on deposit there.
Kayser at once sought Justice Rosenthal's
court and swore to a complaint charging
Brooks with obtaining money under false
Â¦pretenses and also with Intent to defraud.
Brooks was arrested this evening by
Constable Marshall and in default of
$2000 bonds went to jail. After occupying
a cell for a short time he sent for Justice

SAN" JOSE. Oct. 19.â Judge Rhodes of.
the Superior Court renoered a decision to
day In favor of petitioners In the manda
rr.us proceedings of Owen D. Richardson
and Martin Murphy, who had brought
an action to compel County Clerk Pfister
to place them on the ballot for the places
of City Justice and County Auditor, re
flectively. This will upset local politics
find those of other counties generally
throughout the Sta.te. as In almost every
county the sanse question has arisen.
Vacancies occurred Jn the ofhees of
County Auditor and City Justice here a
few months ago and the Board of Super
visors filled them by appointment.
The Republican party maintained that
t'no appointees hold ofiice until the general
flection of Y.^'l, and made no nomination?
for the places. The law was somewhat
uncertain. It reading that thÂ«? appointees
held office urTtll the next scneral election
<jr the expiration of the term. The Dom
oexmts maintained thr.t the torm expired
â¢with this election, and made nominations.
Owen D. Richardson was named for City
Justice ar.d Martin Murphy for County
Auditor. When the Democrat? presented
their certificate of. nominations Clerk Flit

an opinion given by .District Attorney
Campbell to the HÂ«Â»ard of Supervisor.

Jua&e Rhodes held that the. Supervisors
had no power to appoint an oftiocr save
only till his successor could be elected at
the" next peneral election -ana nm until
the expiration of the term. The offices of
City Justice and Auditor will therefore fce

the term of the office in which the vacancy
occurred; but as the provision of the act of 1S37
provides for another event in respect to which,
or dependent upon which, that period may ex

of the term of office of the prior incumbent.

SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 19.â George
Smith, Instructor of the San Rafael
Golf Club, to-night hissed the
American flag in Gordon's Opera
house. The flag was exhibited dur
ing a performance given by a col
ored minstrel troupe. At the com
mencement of the show Smith
sauntered In, accompanied by sev
eral friend?. He was quiet until one
of the performers appeared upon
the stage in a. Red Cross uniform,
carrying across his shoulder the
national colors. This evidently was
too much for the Imported golfer to
stand, and he gave vent to his feel-
Ing In a loud hiss. It was not of
the ordinary goose variety, but one
long, sizzling hiss, with a cockney
covering:.
So sudden was the Insult that the
audience was dumfounded. Albert
Boyen. cashier of the Hotallng
Bank In this city, and several oth
ers rushed to where the offender
was seated and remonstrated. Just
as the full extent of the insult be
gan to dawn upon the audience
Smith left tho house with his

been rendered against the lnccÂ«ne tax act

Jones Explains Democratic Allusion
CONTINGENCY CONTEMPLATED
I would prefer not to express any opinion
with reference to the decision itself. In fact.
I think it would be indelicate. If not highly
imiÂ»roi>er. for me so to do.
I do not see how the decision of JudÂ«te
Rhodes can affect the ofiice of member of the
State Board of Equalization. Judse Rhodes
wa? considering county and township officer/
onl-.- and Jiis decision is based wholly upon the
provisions of the county government act. which
t^ars no relation whatever to the State Board
Oi Lquallsation nor to vacancies occurring
therein.
Considerable commotion was caused In
local Democratic circles by the announce
ment of the decision of Judge Rhwties of
San Jose ordering that the names of two
Democratic nominees for offlces now* held
by supervisorial appointvfs be placed upon
the official ballots. Jt was thought that
this decision, although affectim? only
county office*, mipht have some Gearing
on the State ticket. The Democratic
State Convention nominated Hull Mc
eiauK-nry of San Francisco for State
Equalizer and Secretary of State Currv
denied his name a place on the ballot,
holding that the position for which Mc-
Claughry was named having been filled
by Governor Gage's appointment of L. H.
Mrown. It would not become vacant until
the regular term expired two years
hence. Ixscal Democrats express the
opinion that by the same line of reaeon
ing followed by Judge Rhodes in deciding
u e Santa Clara County case McCIiu^hry
would be entitled to a place on the Sitate
ticket as a candidate for Equalizer, for
which the Republicans have made no
nomination. Speakinjc of this Attorney
General Tirey J.. Ford said last night:

The period for which the appointee Is to hold

VANCOUVER. Oct. 19.â Leigh Hunt,
formerly of Seattle, is an American
millionaire who owns more gold mines
and hydraulic concessions from the Gov
ernment of Korea than all of the other
foreigners In that country put together.
He Is not yet 35 and Is reputed to bo worth
J20,W0,(W, acquired chiefly through lucky
Investments In the Orient. Five years In
Korea, most of the time living in simple
style among- the natives, have made an
eccentric out of him. He has Just arrived
from the Orient and evidently left there
with the Idea of making up for his past
lack of holidays.
On the second day out he was unwilling
ly drawn Into a poker game on the
steamer. The limit soon touched the cell
ing, and Hunt and Baron de St. Laurrent,
the Belgian Vice Consul at Shanghai, who
was on his way home on official business,
were soon the only one3 who could stand
the pressure. Baron do St. Laurrent was
the principal factor In bringing about a
settlement of the Chinese question, ac
cording to his own version of the story.
The- men gambled with huge jackpots
until early In the morning, by which time
the Belgian diplomat had parted with all
of his loose cash and I O U's aggregating
$3500. International complications were
matters of a misty past when the Baron
tremblingly listened to Hunt's next sug
gestion.
"I don't v/ant to keep your money," said
the American, cheerfully. "Let's shake
dice and you can win it all back by doub
ling every time you shake."

and in a short time the bulk of his for

was foreclosed upon and Hunt found him

Somewhere, you may depend upon it.
this work will show forth in the form of
disease. It may become so fixed and
chronic that it cannot be thrown off. It
is hard to induce a man or a woman to
prive up coffee when thev have become
addicted to its. use. but if such people
can be Riven Postum Food Coffee thev
will quickly chanpe for the better, for
the food drink, when properlv made, has
even a more beautiful color than the or-
dinary coffee, and has the delicious
toothsome flavor of old irovernment
Java of the milder and hieher priced
grades.
The work of reorganization betrins a:
once, for the tearing down element of
coffee has been eliminated, and in its
place the strong rebuilding effects of the
elements contained in the food coffee
fro directly to work to rebuild the
broken-down delicate irray matter in the
nerve c&nters and brain. This is iust
plain, old-fashioned common sense that
any thoughtful person can make use of:
!n fact, hundreds of thousands of brain-
workers in America have already discov-
ered the fact and are usine Postum

and relief.
The disordered condition passes
thence from the brain to all parts of the
body, and in some it will show in trep-
idation (well-known nervous condi-
tion); in others this is hidden, but the
vrork goes on from day to day. until
some day the accumulation of forces
climaxes in some orjranic disease. It
may be the kidneys become affected
and Bright's disease sets up: it may be
weak eyes, may be catarrh, stomach
trouble, palpitation and heart failure
("which is becoming: more and more no-
ticeable among Americans).
Many a person will exclaim. ".\'on-
sense! It is easy for' any thoughtless
person to jump at a conclusion that a
philosopher would study carefullv over
before reaching. Think of the members
of your own family: how many of them
are perfectly and completely well in

friends arc perfectly healthy? Inquire
of them and you will be surprised to
learn that the average of one in evcrv

November at which candidates will be
nominated and officers elected to serve
the club during the year 190L An Impor
tant matter to be discussed will be the
possible consolidation of the three rowing
cluba at Long: wharf, at least so far ns
securing a new site for their boathouses
Is concerned.
The location suggested Is near the Union
Iron Works, as that concern must keep
a large area of water open for the pur
pose of launching warships.
The Dolphins last Sunday launched from
their boathouse, in the presence of many
members and friends, a new pleasura
barge, named America. Though boat rac
ing Is over numerous rowing parties are
to be seen on the-, bay on Sundays and
visits are paid to the United States Ufo
paving station, to Harbor View, and the
ark Idle Hour, drawn up on North Beach
The Dolphins are discussing the cost
of procuring an outrlgged skiff from an
Eastern builder and having It shipped out
to San Francisco.
The committee in charge of the annual
entertainment of the Alameda Boating
Club at Its last meeting found that It haa
the offer of, more talent than it can em
ploy. The entertainment will be made up
of the best material and will take place
November 9.

FROM THE KENNELS
Philip C. Meyer, the well known St.
Bernard fancier, had a mimic warfare in
his kennels on Monday last, that but for
timely Interference would have resulted
in fatal consequences to at least one of
his cracks. At about 2 a. m. his trainer
heard a noise In the kennels, and hurried
ly descending found that the new arrival,
Le King, had broken down the fence be
tween his house and that of Grand Mas
ter II and had fastened his teeth in the
latter's throat. The other dogs were ex
cited by the sounds of battle and were
eagerly striving to break down their own
fences and were in a fair way to succeed.
The task of separating Le King and
Grand Master II was np easy one, and
when it was accomplished It was found
that the latter 'was severely bitten.
Frompt medical attendance was secured
and CJrand Master is in a fair way to
recover. Le King Is now monarch of all

The Corinthians have had so successful
and pleasant a season that it has not
been thought necessary to prepare any
elaborate entertainment for closing day.
The yachts will dress *-hip this afternoon
and on the arrival of tne 6:30 p. m. ferry
boat from the city a Corinthian supper
will be served on the porch. After sup

will be raised and th6 majority of the
yachts will seek the protected waters of
the lagoon.
To-day will also see the closing of the
California Yacht Club. The yachts will

Weeping and bewailing their lot, the
"pretzel" team has done nothing all week

the basement are the Dudes, and they will
have to play fast, steady ball until thÂ»
reason closes if they do not wish to re

coaches expect big things. As yet nothing can be told about
their ability beyond that they have the necessary weight and
strength. Hector is a student in the law school and has a
football record, having played with the Olympics, against
Dutte in 1S96.
Tullbnck is by no means an easily settled question. Braley
fails to throw enouch dash into his play. He is capable of
doing good work, but Is too often erratic and heedless. At
present, however, he seems to have a slight lead over Fautz,
his rival and the man who played that position in the last
tame.
After a fortnight's Illness, Cornish Is occupying his old
place as center. Castlehun giving way to him and returning to
his contest with Albertson for left tackle.
More, with greatly improved work, seems now to have a
firm hold on the position of quarterback. Zan and Mcl^ain
may beat him out. but the chances are slim.
Duden, after playing a remarkably brilliant game during
the week, is considered to be slated for left half. Mini and
Sherman are playrng nearest to him, but lack his superior
weight and strength.
The rest of the varsity line-up is familiar: Clay, left
guard; Prlngle, right tack!e; Woinble, right end: Smith, right
half.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 19.â The past week has
seen a cessation from th? heavier work of the gridiron by both
the varsity and freshman squads. Coach Yost, however, has
k<pt the teams busy at signal practice in the endeavor to de
velop team work, and with reasonable success so far as the
big team is concerned. The men continue to display excellent
spirit and are learning the technique of the game. . Another
week's training with some heavy practice games will tell how
well Yost has Instilled the idea of team play Into the eleven.
The progress cf the freshman team Is far from satisfac
tory. With only a week more to train for their match with
the California freshmen they are without a captain and show
little signs of cohesion. The spirit of the men is good and the
material up to the average of the ordinary baby team, except
in weight. But with the exception of Stanford at half. Lunt at
tackle- and Bansbach at quarter there Is no one playing up to
form. Slnca the cardinal freshmen will average many pounds
lighter to the man than their adversaries they can only hope
to win by fa*t. tierce playing.
To-morrow the varsity meets the San Jose Normal team
on tjie campus. Though the cardinal scored thirty-five points
against them two weeks ago, the visiting team win likely hold
Stanford down to an cvener score, as it has made good use of
the Intervening time.
Next x Friday the big team will have the novel opportunity
of meeting an alumni team. Coach Yost, who has been plan
ning such an event for some time, has completed all arrange
ments. Among the all-star aggregation will be ex-Varsity
Captains Downing '95. Flckert '9S and Murphy '00, besides such
well known players as Code '96. Harrelson '95. Reynolds '96.
lowers 'M. Barnhlsel '94. Burnett '95, McLaine "97. Plalte ex '99
and Parker '00. The game, which -will be played on the college
campus, is attracting much attention and will doubtless be a
hard-fought match.
THE Reliance eleven will meet the University of Califor
nia team this afternoon on the Berkeley football field.
Up to date the clubmen have played three games with
the university teams, two of which have been ties
zero gamesâ and the third a victory for Stanford by a
single touchdown.
This Reliance team is much to be commended both for the
kind of football it has played and the comparative success it
has met with en the field. Composed of young men who have
but Â«n hour to give to football practice each day, the team Is
surprisingly strong and freshly energetic. A victory by the
Reliance team over* either college would be something greatly
to their credit.
Although the season has not yet shed Its first skin, the out
look is perhaps brighter for Stanford than for California.
With the influx of old and tried Eastefn blood Stanford has
rejuvenated itself on the football field. But conditions are tak
ing- on a rosier hue at California and the discrepancy in ability
between that team and Stanford la converging like the tracks
of a railroad on a long, level 6tretch.
BERKELEY, Oct. 19.â The second game which the Uni
versity of California is to play with Reliance promises to be
no such contest as the first. Practice has become harder and
fiercer as the competition for places narrows down and the
coaches are whipping the practicing elevens ,lnto more certain
team play. Perhars. too. no greater factor has contributed to
this renewed energy than conparison with Stanford's scores.
Coach Kellv follows Cochran's method in developing his
team. The early part of the season nas been devoted to sifting
the quantity of material and sizing up the varsity possibili
ties. This preliminary stage is nearly over. At present the
unprecedented number of Injured men laid off from practice
has hindered the decision of the coach and captain. But the
time is almost past when a new man may show his ability.
From now on the policy will be to train together such material
as has been developed, to take what hnve been Judged to be
the best men and weld them into a perfect working team. Who
these best men are is now a comparatively easy matter to see.
That this has been partially done may lie seen from the fact
that practically only four changes have been made In the line
up of the team that played two weeks ago. These changes,
however, are significant. Left end. which was held by liraley,
has been given to Starr, the recently elected freshman captain.
Owing to an unfortunate Injury to the muscles of his knee
last night he will be kept out of the game Saturday and 'may
possibly be prevented from playing In the freshman intercol
legiate match. Dibblee or Hudson Is to play In his place.
Right guard, which has been a battle ground for several
husky, evenly matched candidates, will be filled to-morrow by
Stow, the crack freshman tackle, who Is rapidly proving him
self to be a first class man. Luce, who has been playing in
this position, is on the hospital list. Dunbar and O'Toole have
been playing very good ball for men new at the position. They
are both likely candidates. From Overall and Hector, the two
giant freshmen guards, now both cut on the field playing, the

The green committee of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club has prepared a schedule
of events to be played by the men during
the coming winter on Saturdays and nub
lic*Â»holldays. The ladies' tournaments will
be arranged among themselves and will
generally take place during the week.
On the first Saturday cf each month there
wilt be a handicap tournament for men.
the entrance fee for which will be two
golf balls, th* winner to take the whole.
This afteriroon at 2 o'clock there will
be a driving competition on the Presidio
links, each contestant driving five balls.
Next Saturday, at 10:30 in the morning,
there will be a putting contest four balls
from diametrically opposite points on the
circumference of each putting green. At
1:30 in the afternoon the qualifying round
over eighteen holes, medal play, for thÂ»
competition for the Council's cup, for
men, wnl take place. The first competi
tion for the Council's cup will be played
on November 10, and the second on. No

The third semi-annual competition for
the Council's cup of t.he Oakland uott
Club took place last Saturday among the
eight players who qualified and resulted
In the victory of W. P. Johnson, whose
name and score will be engraved on the
handsome trophy. To-day on the Adams
Point links there will be men's foursomes,
with handicap, over eighteen holes, match
play, for prizes.
The Sausalito Golf Club has learned
with pleasure from the military authori
ties that only a barracks and some quar
ters for officers will be built at Fort Ba
ker Instead of the more extensive build
ings at first suggested. It will, however,
be necessary for the green committee, af
ter careful consideration of the plans of
the United States engineer, to lay out
afresh the first two and the last holes of
the course, as these will be Interfered
with by the soldiers' quarters. The Sau
salito golfers will be granted the unusual
privilege of erecting a clubhouse on the
united States military reservation and a
body of military prisoners from Alcatraz
Island will be set to work at the building
of a wide and easy road through the res
ervation to the golf links. Tho rain will
soften the ground and render it possible
to bf sin soon.
The San Rafael Golf Club will hold two
handicap medal play "best ball" compe
titions to-dayâ one for ladles at 10 a. m.,
the other, for men at 2 p. m. In a com
petition of this kind each player may
make as many rounds as he wishes !f
accompanied by a scorer, and his lowest
score for each hole is used in making up
his "best ball" score. From this the han
dicap, if any. Is deducted.

The duck shooters have been genuflect
ing for rain during the past two weeks.
Now they have It and In consequence
are very happy. If the weather regulator
will give them a cold snap and some
dark days their self-content and peace of
m!r.d will be very much like the beatific
regions, where all is as it should be.
This season has up to date been more
or less eccentric. Naturally It has had
its effect upon the shooters, who always
reflect the seasonal conditions. The first
shoot was a record-breaker, and the nlm
rods, while satisfying their pent-up lust
for a big string, drove all the birds off
the marshes. They went at It the follow
ing week, returning to town with curses
for hot weather and no ducks. The first
day's shoot found them stammering with
unpolluted Joy at their success, arid all
that could be heard were figures pretty
close to the 100 mark. At present they
are fearful of boasting, and in many cases
a man who has had a good shoot goes
through a process of reduction before he
will announce the number of killed. May
be he fears the Legislature and restric
tive, limiting laws.
In certain localities on the Suisun
marshes the shooting Â¦was very good last
week. The Field and Tule Club seems to
have found choice land for the sport of
its members. Last Sunday Harry B. Hop
mer was high man with fifty-four birds,
of which sever;. 1 were canvasbaoks and a
number of them mallards. Mallards are
quite plentiful In the Suisun marshes, and
the "canp" are beglnnmg to come in. On
Wednesday Al Oummings brought back
seventy-nine ducks after a day's shoot
ing, and more than half of them were
mallards.
At the Willow Lodge the shooting; was
good during the week, hut further down
the bay the sport was not up to the
standard. Word from the Point Reyes
club befpeaks good shooting, and several
of the members will try their luck this
week.
The quail season opened In Marln Coun
ty last Monday, and those who Â¦were out
to enjoy the sport returned with fair-sized
bagp. Harry Golcher was one of the first
of local sportsman on the field. He came
home with enough birds for several din
ners. On the Country Club preserves
were all the old-timers, and they reached
the limit of twenty-five birds long before
the passion for shooting was exhausted.
Last Monday the rail season opened* In
San Mateo County. One reads a great
d*al about the uproar of the game depu
ties and wardens in tho counties concern
ing unseasonal shooting. On Sunday the
marshes In San Mateo County were fairly
well crowded with shooters who, unmo
lested, made rail their especial game tar
get.
Tom Casey, wharfinger by occupation,
hut sportsman when off duty. Is now solv
ing a firearm problem. He recently sold
his famous 16-bore gun because It shot
too close. He is using In Its place a 10
bore. which he has termed the "Scatter
er." He was out on the marshes last Sun
day and the "Scatterer" spouted all day,
proving a friend to many of Casey*'s
friends.

OUT of all comparison with any
former big coursing event in
America will he the John Grace
challenge etsp to be run at Union
Coursing Park to-day and to-
morrow under the auspices of the Inter-
state Coursing Club. In prizes $f,GiO will
be distributed among the fastest dogs that
were ever let slip on American soil. From
England. Ireland. Australia, the Kast and
West the best stock will have its blood
represented on the Inclosed field of Union
p^rk.
Coursing men who have been devoted
followers of the sport on this coast during
the last live years and who have watched
with critical eye the performances of the
dogs entered in this colossal dog stake
say that out of the sixty-four hounds In
the running fifty of them have a chance
at the big stake prize and the handsome
cup that goes with it. This in itself in-
sures close courses; the fine quality of the
dogs is a warrant of the highest class
performances.
Perhaps in no other part of the world
has coursing developed with such rapid
strides as In California, particularly in
San Francisco. In 1SS6 the first John
Grace cup was established. The total
purse was $240. A year after the event
was repeated, the total purse amounting
to $562 50. From this figure there was p.
jump to J1570. Then came a total purse
for $2020. succeeded in the next year by
an increase which made a total.purse of
$2375. All the stake prizes distributed In
all the preceding John Grace events
amount to $6767 50â$157 50 more than the
present stake. â¢â¢
Until For Freedom met with an acci-
dent a couple of weeks ago it was gener-
ally conceded that this unbeaten cham-
pion would be the undoubted favorite.
Now the wise ones are scratching heads
and talking of form. Beacon. Luxor, Palo
Alto, Royal Flush. Mayflower, Sir Pasha.
Fiery Face, Warship and a host of others
are puzzling the heads of the bettors,
Here is the way they will be posted on the
long-odds book: Beacon 6, Palo Alto 7,
Luxor S; Royal Flush, Mayflower, Sir
Pasha 10; Narcissus, Flying Fox, For
Glory. Royal Union 12; Golden Russett,
Sacramento Boy, Mac's Melody, "Warship,
King Cotton. Bohe. Connemara and Flora
McDonald 15;. The other dogs entered
will range on the long-odds book from $20
upward. Sir Pasha is picked by many for
stake honors on account of recent per
formances.
On Sunday the sport will begin with the
first round of the Consolation stake,
courses to be run In the order In which
the dogs were beaten in Saturday's run
down. Then the two stakes will alternate
until completion of both. ,
Anticipating rain, the entire betting
ring, grandstand and promenade at Union
Park will be covered with canvas.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 19.â The question
whether an ante-nuptial contract could be
made, whereby a husband could be re
leased from supporting and maintaining
his wife after contracting marriage. wa3
brought up before Judge Allen to-day.
Simon BenlolT filed an answer to the
complaint of. his wife In a suit to compel
him to support her. They were married
on March 20, 1S99, and a child was born
on September 14 of the same year. Benloff
never lived with his wife after the mar
riage, but has paid $10 a week since the
birth of their child for its support. His
answer acknowledges the paternity of the
child, and as an answer to why he has
never supported his wife he sets up an
ante-nuptial contract, In which It was
agreed between himself and his wife that
they should marry so that the child would
be made legitimate, but that further than
paying $10 a week for Its support Mrs.
Benioff should have no claim on his prop
erty, nor should he prc'/lde for her main
tenance.
Judge Allen. In making an order for $50

It Is positively revolting to a respectable com
munity. As to this ante-nuptial contract, if
it Is valid, then the marriage is void, as the
code regulating the marriage tie provides for
support and maintenance of the wife and fam
ily. A contract made vitiating this provision
would, to my mind, render the marriage con

MILTON, Oct. 13.â A general storm Is
prevailing through this part of the coun
try to-day. Reports brought In from the
mining towns Indicate a considerable fail,
with all Indications pointing to It3 con
tinuance. In this vicinity the storm in
sures new feed, which will be a great ben
efit to stockowners. In the mining region
a sufficient fall will result in starting up
those mines which have been shut down
for some time for lack of water. This
rÂ»aar.s the employment of many workmen
at good wages.
SAXTA ROSA. Oct. 19.â Ratn began to
fall here at an early hour this morning
and has continued ever since. The Indica
tions are that It Is general throughout the
county. No especial damage will result,
as farmers generally are prepared for
winter rains.
JAMESTOWN. Oct. 19.â It commenced
raining about 1 a. m. to-day. Up to 5
p. m. the precipitation was 1.4o Inches. The
Tuolumne Water Company's reservoirs
are full. In another week repairs will
have been completed upon the flumes and
water and power supplied to the mining
companies of Tuolumne County.
PACIFIC GROVE. Oct. 19.â A fine soak
ing rain fell here this afternoon, the pre
cipitation being slightly under a halj inch.
The downpour Is believed to be general
throughout this section and Is welcome to
the ranchers.

MORENO WIIX SOON BE
ERASED FROM THE MAP
Business Houses and Dwellings Be
ing Removed to Riverside Be
cause of Lack of Water.
RIVERSIDE, Oct. 19.â The uncompro
mising little settlement in the Moreno
Valley will soon be erased from the map
if present Indications count for anything.
Several business houses of Moreno are on
wheels, being moved to Riverside by their
owners, and one person estimates that
thirty-five other buildings have already
been brought here during the past year.
The cause of this wholesale exodus Is
the failure of the water company to de
liver sufficient water to settlers. Eight
years ago the town of Moreno was estab
lished under auspicious circumstances. A
tine hotel and several substantial brick
blocks were built and a good newspaper
nourished for a time. Settlers bought
land. Bet it out In groves and the new
town seemed to promise much, but the
drought came and the company that sold
the land was unable to supply the water
necessary to keep the trees and vegetation
thriving. Consequently the residents of
Moreno and many of the ranchers were
compelled to abandon their homes and
seek pastures new. Many came to River
side, purchased lots and are moving their
houses upon them.
SAN FRANCISCO YOUTH
CHARGED WITH FRAUD
SAN JOSE. Oct. 19.â As an aftermath
to a fast and furious time, G. Wempe, a
young blood of San Francisco, has got
himself into a financial entanglement
which will necessitate his appearance in
Justice Rosenthal's court here. Wempe
attended the fair and races. Luck was
against him and he lost his money. He
appealed to friends for aid and they in
troduced him to Thad Hobson of the T. W.
Hobson Company. A loan of J130 was
asked and Hobson readily complied, giv
ing him a check on the First National
Bank, and taking an oroer on the firm of
Wempe Bros., paper-box manufacturer
of San Francisco, for the money. Wempe
paid he was one of the flrm and the
money would be quickly forthcoming.
Hobson sent his order to the flrm, but
it would not honor it. To-day he swore
to a complaint charging Wempe with ob
taining money under false pretenses. The
young man also left other creditors here,
and they are threatening to take the same
steps. Young Wempe is said to be heir to
J1W.000.
VANCOUVER. Oct. 19.â The steamer
Dolphin arrived early this morning from
Skaguay with 240 passengers, who are
about the last who will come out from
liawr-on this season. She brought $200,000
in gold, of which $05.<X>0 was owned by
Ed McKeown, formerly a policeman of
Winnipeg. McKeowfi has been in the
north two year-; and was "broke" when he
went there. Other passengers had the
remainder of the money in smaller
amounts.
Tom Lan*> an-! his brother, William, are
two young Knerlishmen who went in early
last war. They sold out, making lla-O" 1 Â©
each. O. H. Burke, formerly a resident
of Fresno County. Cal., comes out with
$22.<i00. and two other rich Americans
Â¦cere Mr. and Mr?. James Wright.
The mwi startling incident of the trip
out occurred when the steamer was with
in a day of Vancouver. Many of the
passengers declared that for a few min
u:Â«*p they never expected to see shore
again. The steamer came out toward
<j:ieo:i Charlotte Sound late in the night
*rd was caught in a rainstorm in
thÂ« worst part of the entrance. The en
trance is dotted with scores of little isl
ands, and in thp blackness of the night
the Ftf-amer lost her way. She felt
around for a while and a littl" later the
v.ind came in from the wc-pt in a way
that made the waves dance up and down
around her high enough to drt-neh all
those on d*-ck. Soon it was blowing a
hurricane, and the speed was reduced so
that the PfeBsel could stop on the shortest
notice. This care probably saved her from
gnjng upon the rookF. for suddenly break
ers were noticed siraipht Hhead. and not
more than 300 fert from the bow of the

MINERS SUFFER HARDSHIPS.
Face Starvation in Rushing' to New
Gold Fields on Clear Creek.
VICTORIA, Oct. 19.â At least 100 of
those who stampeded to the new strike- on
C.'car Creek, up the Stewart River from
L>awson and the Klondike, suffered great
piivations. They were lost In the hills
while making their way across the Ci-ide,
and with their scant supplies (for they
left Dawson with no more than they
could entry) they were soon without food
other than the roots or berries they could
find and what they could shoot.
"I do not think that any have lost their
live*, although it is not impossible that
such should havo been the casÂ». However.
there are quite a number of creeks tribu

This is the statement made by E. E.
Scroggie of Scroggle Creek, who arrived
ht-re to-r.ight from the new finds on Clear
Creek. Mr. Scroggie says (and In this nt
is confirmed by the Mining Recorder of
the district, who came out with him) that

and the McKinley and Roosevelt Club,
nearly 200 strong, headed by Hearn's fa
mous juvenile band, marched to the Pal
ace Hotel and escorted the speakers to
the hall through a blaze of rockets and
red fire. Major Charles L. Hewes of the
State Militia and president of the local
Republican Club, acted as president of the
meeting. After a short address by Luch
singer and Anderson, Metcalf was intro

audience for nearly two hours, speaking
on the tariff and Philippine questions.
PHELAN AND GRAVES SPEAK.
San Francisco's Mayor Addresses a
Los Angeles Audience.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19.â The local De
mocracy to-night shook itself from the
apathy that has enveloped it throughout
the campaign and prepared a big demon
stration in honor of William R. Graves,
the candidate for Congress in the Sixth
District, Mayor Phelan of San Francisco
and Chairman J. C. Sims of the State
Central Committee. A mass meeting was
held in Hazard's Pavilion and was at
tended by 3500 persons, who received each
speaker with enthusiasm.
Ex-Mayor Meredith P. Snyder, who is
again a candidate for re-election, presided
and introduced William R. Graves as the
first speaker. Mr. Graves in a brief speech
declared that he was neither lost nor cone
before, but was the real candidate for
Congress. He â¢emphatically denied that
there was any collusion or fraud in his
nomination or that it was accomplished
by any compact or understanding with
the Southern Pacific Company. The
charge that he was put up to be knocked
down or to assist in the election of any
other candidate he branded as a baseless
fabrication; nor was there any lack of
enthusiasm on his part, because he be
lieved the country would go Democratic
Nothing but physical inability had pre
vented him prosecuting his canvass hith
erto. In conclusion Mr. Graves promised
"to discuss things" later and made way
for Mayor Phelan.
Mayor Phelan's speech was mainly de
voted to an arraignment of the adminis
tration's policy in the Philippines and to
the dangers of militarism. In concluding
he said:
This is the first opportunity the people havo
had to speak. If they are blind to the lessons
of history, to the genius of their institutions
to the sacred character of their constitution'
they will rue the day. If they rebuke the ad
mln.tÂ«tratlon another evidence will be ulvÂ«Â»n to
the world of the Intelligence, power and pa
triotism of the American people.
Chairman Sims was the last speaker on
the programme, but before he had fairly
started his argument the audience had
dispersed and he withdrew.
TRACY'S WELCOME TO WOODS
Republican Flambeau Clubs Parade
the Streets of the Town.
TRACY, Oct. 19.â Sam D. Woods, Re
publican candidate for Congress in this
district, was given a great welcome to his
home county at Tracy to-night. The
Rough Rider Club and a band attended
from Stockton and were here supple
mented by a local club of torch and flam
beau bearers. For an hour before the
time set for the meeting to begin the air
was clamorous with the shouts of march
ing men and brilliant with the flare of
great bonfires and bursting bombs.
The 'hall- where the meeting was held
was not nearly large enough to hold those
who sought admission. After the meet
ing. the streets were crowded with people
wearing Woods buttons and shouting For
the next Congressman from this district.
Bonfires Blaze , at Tulare.
TULARE, Oct. 19.â Hon. Jud Rush, the
eloquent Los Angeles Democratic speaker,
addressed a large and enthusiastic audi
ence here this evening. It was composed
largely of farmers; from the- surrounding
country. Music was supplied by, the Tu
lare brass band and bonfires and cannon
ading enlivened' the evening.
STOCKTON. Oct. 19.â Inclement weath
er, theaters, concerts and rival political
gatherings failed to lessen the magnifi
cence of the reception to Samuel M.
Shortridge this evening. The Republican
marching clubs had gone to Tracy to as
sist in the Woods demonstration, yet Ma
sonic Music Hall was filled to overflowing
with enthusiastic bupporters of the ad
ministration. Among the vice presidents
were several former Democrats.
Mr. Shortridge spoke for nearly two
hours and held the undivided attention of
liis auditors from first to last. The
speaker said he assumed that Democrats
were actuated by the same patriotic mo
tives that inspired Republicans, but they
were certainly under false leaders. It
was a refreshing sign of the times to hear
their laudations of the immortal Lincoln,
and it would not be too much to hope that
twenty years from now the opposition
orators would be referring to the wise
and statesmanlike policy of William. Mc-
Kinley.
Mr. Shortridge declared in his own in
imitable style that the Republican party
stood for the flag. The Republicans could
not see In that glorious banner a symbol
of oppression. If the standards of des
potism* could circle the world with con
quests, why should not the beams of con
stitutional liberty emanating from, the
glorious ensign throw their radiance over
the dark places of the world?
The Republican party, he said, stood for
sound money, the- system which had made
the nation and individuals solvent, in
creased the per capita circulation and re
stored the waste places of Democratic
misrule with peace and plenty. The party
of McKinley would rather have Chaffee
and MacArthur upholding the dignity of
the flag in the Orient than to have Gen
eral Coxey marching through this coun
try- It stood for protection, the creator
of our industrial prowess and wage-su
premacy. The merchant marine, now in
Its infancy, would be brought to invinci
ble prowess on every sea through Repub
lican policy.
The Republican party stood for rational
and effective legislation against criminal
trusts, he declared. While Mi. Bryan had
been talking the party had passed and
attempted to execute the only anti-trust
laws upon the Federal statute books. It
would proceed by legitimate and lawful
means to abate such evils as may exist,
but did not believe that legitimate efforts
to raise prices, as with the raisin and
orange growers of California, should bo
harassed by blatant demagogy.
ENTHUSIASM AT RED BI/CTFF.
Democrat Who Renounced Bryanism
Gives His Reasons.
RED BL.UFF, Oct. 19.â There was a
magnificent demonstration here to-night
in honor of Congressman Barham and.
Hon. T. B. Dozier of Redding/ who re
cently-renounced Bryanism to stump the
State for McKinley. Fireworks and
music called out an Immense throng, and
it was one of the greatest meetings ever
reld here. Colonel Runyon, chairman of
the County Committee, presided.
Judge Barham delivered a strong ar
raignment of the Democratic party on the
trust question and backed what he said
by the Congressional Records. Pie urged
the election of Hon. F. L. Coombs to Con
gress, referring to his ability as a legis
lator and as Minister to Japan. He de
clared the issue in the campaign was
bryanism.
Captain Dozier handled the Philippine
question in a convincing way and made a
n.aeterly argument- for McKinley and
continued prosperity. He was warmly
congratulated by scores in the Â¦ audience
for his effort.

NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â A dispatch
to the Journal from London says:
Lord Durham's uffly attack on
AmericaJi jockeys and on sports
men from over the sea. unsup
ported by any proof, has brought on an
international turf storm.
The Daily Telegraph wisely declares
that "it can only be presumed that Lorrl
Durham spokoâ he was addressing the
Jockey Club stewards, of which he is on?
â with a knowledge of much that has prune
on which has not yet met the public eye,
but which must be known to the poweis
that be."
John A. Drake, who has won Jl.CXt.03iJ
in the five months that he has bÂ«-en <m
the English turfâ which is the wnole of
his experienceâ is thoroughly disgusted at
the insults indirectly heaped upon him.
"The position is intolerable," said h.?,
"to any one who loves fair play. Our
trainers and jockeys in England do not
need any word of defense from me. Their
record speaks for itself.
"American jockeys are in bad favor
with the Jockey Club, but had they hurt
the sport in England would the Prince of
Wales have just engaged an American
jockey to ride his horses? Our jockeys
have won too many races.
"American boys ride to win. They have
broken up the English Jockey ring, about
which there was such a cry a while ago.
American jockeys are responsible for an
honesty on the English courses that was
never before known."
Lord William Beresford is preparing a
rebuke to Lord Durham and will engage
for next season Wishard, Mr. Drake's
trainer, to succeed Huggrins, his present
American trainer, who wants to make a
visit home, and will also engage the RelfE
boys for next season.
The Earl of Lonsdale says: "I regret
that I can, with a most unbiased and in
dependent feeling, thoroughly indorse all
that Lord Durham said.
"I have thought and said openly for
some time that I considered the turf in
England in a worse state at the present
time than it has ever been in my recol
lection.
"I do not Imagine for a minute Lord
Durham meant by 'American jockeys and
their following" that that following was
necessarily American.
"There also have been more accidents
recently than I ever remember and I most
certainly attribute this to the presence
of American jockeys."

VICTIM ESCAPES BY RUNNING
Delay in Turning In an Alarm Re
sults in the Destruction of
a Barn and Two
Horses.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 19.â Fire this morning
destroyed two two-story buildings and ad
joining smaller structures in Los Gatos.
The flames started from the range In a
restaurant, which occupied one of the
buildings. The loss is $5000, insured. The
principal losers are Mrs. Cuzard and Alex
ander McKay.
WATSONVILLE, Oct. 19.â Fire at the
Harlns dairy ranch, three miles from
"Watsonvllle, shortly after 12 o'clock last
night, destroyed the dwelling, barns,
dairy house ami other buildings, together
with three horses, machinery, $1000 worth
of grain and other valuable property.
There was no insurance, and the loss is
more than $10,000. John Welch and family
are owners of the ranch. The cause of the
fire Is not known.
Ten Thousand Dollar Loss Sustained
by Rancher John Welch of
Watsonville.
Abels' loss will probably amount to
$1500. Two horses and a quantity of hay
were burned. An attempt to destroy the
same property by an Incendiary was
made on Slay 7. Benjamin can 1 give but
a vague description of the Incendiary.
DAIRY RANCH BUILDINGS
DESTROYED BY FLAMES
Xunce Benjamin, a young man who
drives a delivery wagon around town,
was on his way home at 356 North Eighth
street at the time. He saw the blaze and
rushed to the Eureka engine-house, in the
near vicinity. As he ran past the burn
ing building yelling, "fire! a heavy-set
man dashed out and ordered him to stop.
Benjamin kept on running, with the man
after him. Just as he reached the door
of the fire house the firebug caught him.
The fellow hurled Benjamin into the
middle of the road, and with an oath
aimed a vIcIoub blow at his head. Benja
min dodged and jumped to his feet. He
recovered himself before the firebug was
upon him and sprinted for home. The fel
low pursued him up to the door of the
house. In the meantime neighbors had
been aroused and an alarm of fire turned
in.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 19.â The barn of O. K.
Abfls. a dealer In hay and wood, ! at
Eighth and Julian streets, was destroyed
by fire this morning at 3 o'clock. The
blaze was the work of an incendiary, an.l
he w.is almost caught In the act. So
determined^ was the ' firebug to accom
plish his purpose that he pursued his dis
coverer and probably . would have added
murder to that of arson had he succeeded
in catching him.

CALITOBNIANS IN NEW YORK.
The scandal which has broken about the head of
Henry C. Dibbje, who asks that he be chosen to dis
grace again the people of the Forty-first Assembly
District, indicates very clearly thnt legislative high
waymen play no favorites. Good measures as well as
bad ones are grist for them.
His Highness the Maj-or has some serious work to
do among his hired men in the local Treasurer's office.
Snme of them have been talking out of school and
confess that the "pull" works wonders in their office.
His Highness must have shuddered when he re
called that hefting incident.
Pit seems impossible to satisfy the critics of our new
reform" government. They are expressing surprise
. r.j;d dissatisfaction thit the charter is cither silent or
ambiguous in reference to vital elements of city gov
ernment. Tlie rest of us had accepted these facts as
matters of course.
Scandal has laid her black wing over the Federal
Immigration Bureau in this city. The authorities
should remember that in dealing. with certain classes
of Japanese they are handling merchandise where
carelessness is as dangerous as criminality.
If the latest allegations of some of the probate
sharks who were exposed by The Call be true, it was
rhuch more satisfactory, safe and profitable toTob.a
living rascal than to prey upon the unoffending dead.
THE MEN BACK OF BRYAN.
ONE of the most notable addresses of the cam
paign, is that recently made at Concord by
Senator Hoar in defense of his position that 'the
true friends of liberty and of good government, even
if opposed to the. Philippine policy of the administra
tion, should none the less vote for McKinley and
against Bryan. The Senator's argument is that the
Republican party has accomplished for human rights
all that has been accomplished in that direction in this
country for fifty years; that the Democratic party has
been opposed to every effort to protect the negroes,
or to advance the prosperity; of white workingmen.
and that Bryan, even if sincere, could not as Presi
dent achieve anything against the powers of the party
that elected him.
Commenting upon the issue before the people hs
said: "You cannot help the cause of anti-imperialism
by going into partnership with Bryanisru. You can
not mix tyranny, dishonor, broken faith; anarchy and
license in one cup and have constitutional liberty the
result of the mixture." He went on to point out that
i r Boutwell and Schurz entered into an alliance with
Croker, Tillman, Altgeld. Towne and Bryan the com
bination would still be Democratic and do Democratic
business in the old way.
Should Bryan be elected, what men would have
most power in his administration? To what advisers
would his administration listen? Senator Hoar asked
the questions direct: "Will it listen to Mr. Morgan
and Mr. Pettus, with Alabama behind them? Will it
listen to Mr. McEnery, with Louisiana behind him ?
Will it listen to Mr. McLaurin? All these men are
imperialists. They arc as thoroughly intrenched in
the political leadership of their. States as ever was
Daniel Webster in Massachusetts. Or will it listen to
Mr. Schurz or Mr. Boutwell, with nothing behind
.them?"
Such questions carry their answers with them, but
the Senator did not leave them in the air. He has
served long in Congress and is. familiar with the sen
timents of the Democratic leaders there. Speaking
from the fullness of that ample knowledge, he warned
the anti-imperialists of Massachusetts that back of the
Bryan administration there will be "a solid South, in
tent on disfranchising the negro in earnest and mean
ing business. There will be behind it the free silver
men of the West, in earnest and meaning business.
There will be behind it the Populists, the anarchist
and socialist of the great cities, in earnest and meaning
business. There will be behind it Richard Croker and
Major C. W. Mercer and wife are at the
Palace. The major is commander in chief
of the commissary department at Manila.
Paymaster Wilkins Is also here, and it is
said both officers come to get their dis
charge owing to physical disability.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Central Africa has been so thoroughly associated
in the popular mind with ideas of unexplored wil
dernesses it will be hard for many to understand
there is any real need of establishing an international
game law over it. Most people have thought of the
region as one of well nigh inexhaustible stores of
game of all kinds and so impenetrable that hunters
could hardly do more than follow a few paths through
its amplitude of jungles. It will be remembered, how
ever, that much the same idea' was entertained fifty
years ago of the buffalo of the American plains. The
facilities which civilization have placed at the dis
posal of hunters are such as to enable them to sweep
away the elephants, Rinrffes and other big beasts of
Africa almost as quickly as the buffalo was swept
from this continent.
In the course of the international conference on the
subject the fact was brought out that a good many
wealthy sportsmen in Europe have undertaken to add
big game from Africa and Asia to their preserves. In
some cases these men have become more interested
in propagating the animals than in killing them, and
these parks therefore are likely to. become the means
of preserving several kinds of animals that might be
otherwise exterminated. A report upon that phase
of the subject says: "The prospect is now opened
up of an indefinite increase and thorough acclimatiza
tion of many breeds that were at first thought to be
incapable of survival in a more rigorous climate. Ga
zelles, antelopes, kangaroos, bisons and zebras, wild
sheep, besides different varieties of foreign birds, are
now living in England and France in a wild and nat
ural state. Some of these species have developed to
a surprising extent the capacity to modify their for
mer habits and functions to suit the climate, and, gen
erally speaking, the experiments have thoroughlv
proved the practicability of transferring to Europe
and perpetuating there many varieties of life supposed
to be peculiar to Asia and Africa."
It appears from all reports that it is high time for
joint action on the subject. A single English sports
man, F. C. Selous, is reported to have killed within
a comparatively few years in elephants, and along
with them an uncounted number of other animals. In
fact, the slaughter has been carried forward so rap
idly that a grave danger exists of a complete exter
mination of some of the most valuable beasts of 'the
country.
ONE of the most striking illustrations of the ex
tent to which civilized man has undertaken a
supervision of the entire globe is to be found
in a recent conference in London held for the purpose
of devising an international agreement for the pro
tcction of the big game of Central Africa. The white
race, while seemingly indifferent about the preserva
tion of the weaker tribes of human beings, and indeeil
not unwilling to enter upon the task of thinning out
even so big a tribe as the Chinese, has developed a
keen sense of the desirability of conserving big game,
and the free shooting of elephants, hippopotami and
rhinoceroses in African jungles is to be stopped.
AN AFRICAN GAME PRESERVE.
The Supreme Court is so far behind in
its work that It takes from two to three
years to get a case determined after it is
appealed.
Tfc-s condition of affairs is neither Just
n>-r profitable. Our constitution guaran
tees to all persons charged with crime tho
right to a speedy trial, yet our jails are
full of men waiting for the Supreme Court
to reuch their cases. These men are
compelled to wait a long time for what
the constitution says they shall have
speedily. They contract disease and their
keeping is an expense to the counties.
Civil matters are in a still worse condi
tion, because the courts give precedence
to criminal matters.
A constitution is an. instrument of gov
ernment. Like other laws it should be
amended when necessary to keep
pace with the advancement of the
State No one would contend that
a private business requiring sixteen
clerks should run with eight, and the peo
ple will not try to handle the litigation of
1,009 000 persons with courts provided for
SOO.OOO.
Thomas Jefferson once said: 'Some men
look at constitutions with sanctimonious
reverence and deem them like the ark
of the covenant â too sacred to be touched.
They ascribe to the men of the preceding
ajjea wisdom more than human, and sup
pose what they did to bo beyond amend
ment. â¢ â¢ ? But I know also that laws
and institutions must go hand in hand
with the progress of the human mind.
We might as well require a man to wear
still thn coat which fitted him when a boy
as civilized society to remain ever under
the regimen- of their ancestors." .
1 It is proposed by the amendment to the
constitution to Increase the courts by
abolishing two of the seven Justices of the
Supreme Court, thus leaving five on the
Supreme- 1 bench, and establishing 1 three
district courts of appeal â one at San
Francisco, comprising the counties near
San Francisco Hay;. one at Sacramento,
comprising counties adjacent to Sacra
mento and north; and one at Los Angeles,
comprising the southern counties of the
State.
In each, of these Distiict Courts of Ap
peal there will be three Justices. As soon
as this constitutional amendment is car
ried and the courts established it is 'pro
vided In the amemlmcnt that the present
Supreme Court shall transfer to the Dis
trict Courts of Appeal all cases In their
respective districts now waiting to be
heard and thus the pressure- will be imme
diately removed and the Judicial machin
ery of the great State of California will
move in concert with her commercial and
business interests.
It is false economy to get along with
out sufficient courts. Any department of
public or private business must have suf
ficient force to perform the work of that
department.
You say in your editorial: "Each of -the
Appellate Courts is to consist of three
Judges, making nine in all; each will have
the officers usual to such tribunals; each
will have Its array of' clerks, stenogra
phers and other employes of the kind, and
all of these will have to be provided with
salaries at the expenso of tho taxpayers.
Why should that additional burdon be
imposed upon the people? What public
purpose will the new courts serve so bene
ficial as to compensate for the cost of
their maintenance? Why should we In
crease taxes merely to pay for something
we do not need?"
Now, as n matter of fact, the Appellate
Court of this State Is the least expensive
tribunal in the State when you consider
tho ability of the men employed and the
importance of their work. The expense-*
of the Supreme Court are small compared
to the expenses of the executive and leg
islative department?. It is safe to say
that the additional expense would not ex
ceed the expenses of keeping criminals
in jail waiting for their cases to be
heard, as- is done now, and the saving to
commercial interests by being able, to get
prompt decisions. â¢
-Your chief objection seems to be that
the Judges for the first two years are to
be appointed by the Governor.
. Th* Call fdsQ seems to think that Gov-
Since 1S79 many counties have been di
vided and the number of Superior Judges
has been greatly increased. Yet we have
tho same number of Supreme Court Jus
tices that we had in 1S73.
Since the present constitution was
adopted in 1S79 the population of Califor
nia has nearly doubled. ' In 1S79 it had
about SOO.OOO people; now it probably has
between 1,500,000 and 1,600,000. Its business
and litigation have also greatly increased
in volume.
I do not agree with the sentiments of

the amendment should be carried.
Editor of The Call: In your paper of

"District Courts of Appeal."

Would The Call have the State put to

Governors in the past have appointed

THAT APPELLATE COURT
AMENDMENT.
If it is possible to legislate against this practice of
sending charity patients to this city from interior
towns and cities measures should be taken at once to
draw a bill and submit it to the coming Legislature.
Xot only is the custom an unjust one, but it entails
great suffering and privation upon the miserable sub
jects of it. \
There ought to be a sufficient charity in every town
in California to permanently care for ?uch persons as
Mrs. Schneider, whose case certainly appeals to the
hardest heart. To send such a woman to San Fran
cisco, where the climate is particularly inimical to her
disease, is little less than an outrage, to say nothing
of the motive cf it.
Arriving here she .ind her three children at once
became a burden upon the first locality in which she
paused. Within three days her scanty funds were ex
hausted, and the dying mother, surrounded by her
miserable offspring, was taken in charge by her neigh
bor?, and in this condition was found by the news
paper reporter?.
Mrs. Schneider came here in a dying condition.
She and her three children were sent from an Eastern
city to Los Angeles in the hope that the clirqate down
there would alleviate the lung disease with which she
is afflicted. But the people to whom she. was con
signed in the Orange City held a contrary opinion
with reference to the probable effect of climate
upon her disease, and they promptly raised a purse
with which tn scud hti to San Francisco.
Th:Â« r'.iTe did' not, however, operate satisfactorily.
A number of miserable individuals were turned into
the streets ttr.der it, and in consequence the Board of
Health and the superintendent physician of the
County Hospital came in for a round rib roast in the
daily papers. The fact that destitute sick persons
shipped from the interior to the city were compelled
to take up their residence in the streets, moreover,
did not seem to disturb the authorities of the offend
ing interior towns and cities referred to.
It is the practice not only of interior citizens but of
interior Boards of Supervisors and Common Coun
cils to ship all destitute people coming their way to
San Francisco. A few years ago this practice be
cause so pronounced in the cases of destitute sick that
the local Board of Health adopted a rule providing
tl;at no one who had not resided in San Francisco
for thirty days should be admitted to the County Hos
pital.
have come to light d-.iring the past few years.
THE case of Mr;. Schneider, who arrived hert
from Los Angeles with her three helpless chil
dren a fevi- days aero, and who ever since has
been a charge upon the bounty V charitable strangers,
:>j only one of a large number of similar cases which
fl BAD PRACTICE.
Considering the great questions at Is
sue I can see only one duty, and that is
to support those pledged to sound money,
good government and human progress.
OWEN' SCOTT.
Decatur, 111.. Oct. 10. 1900.
Bryan's sincerity Is blameless, but dan
gerous on his platform. Stevenson Is a
courteous gentleman of the old Kentucky
school. He is honorable and pure in his
motives, but would be, as any Vice Pres
ident must be, a mere presiding officer of
the Senate, with Ices power in his whole
body than the Speaker of the House of
Representatives has in his little flnser.
and determined to do the right as he sees
it. A resolute man with a rugged con
science and a false foundation is the most
dangerous. Those who know Bryan per
sonally as I do respect his purity of pri
vate character, but fear his unbending
determination to carry his purpose Into
execution. If elected he would have free
silver. If by moving heaven and earth he
could secure it. He would carry out
every plank in the Chicago platform if he
had the power. Ha would organize a
Cabinet which would construe the laws
according to his notions. Altgeld as Sec
retary of the Treasury, Tillman as At
torney General, Jones as Secretary of
State, George Fred "Williams as Secre
tary of the Interior, Jerry Simpson as
Secretary of Agriculture, with others of
like views, would make sad havoc of the
affairs of the country for four years.
ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT WHO
DECLARES FOR PARTY OF
GOOD GOVERNMENT.
That report from the highest official source ought
to put an end to most of the lurid stories told by the
Bryanites of the effect of- American "imperialism"
upon the people.' It has been stated that we" have
made enemies where we should have made friends,
that the Porto Ricans are growing more and more
hostile to the flag and the military government, that
we shall have to maintain indefinitely r in the island
an army large enough to hold a sullen and antago
nistic people in submission. Such stories are clearly
campaign ammunition for party use and will die out
when Bryanism dies next November, but just the same
it is gratifying to have them refuted at once. " Porto
Rico is all right.
Of the ability of the natives to form an effective
force for the protection of the island, it is said the ex
periment of utilizing the natives as soldiers has proved
a marked success, judging from the appearance of the
organization as it was seen on parade, review, and in
camp. While there has been no test of the nerve and
courage of the natives in battle, yet General Davis
expressed a belief that they would prove satisfactory-
Other statements in the report are to the effect
that during the year over 30,000,000 pounds of relief
supplies have been distributed by the quartermaster's
department. It lias been found impracticable to use
the native cattle for subsistence, and the refrigerated
beef from this country has been generally acceptable.
The cost of the relief supplies in aid of the hurricane
sufferers was $824,828. In the local elections General
Davis says there was never present at or near a
voting place an armed -soldier, and "the bayonet was
conspicuous by its absence."
General Davis says the prospects of the government
of the island are excellent, and that as soon as the or
ganization of the civil government is completed and
the administrative machinery is in working order
tbere will be no necessity to retain in the island so
large a force as at present. He estimates that the gar
rison can be reduced to thirteen companies, and an
even greater reduction could be made should it be
deemed advisable, though he himself thinks it would
not be wise to limit the garrison to a force just suf
ficient to take care of the guns at San Juan. He
points out that Porto Rico, in the future as in the
past, will have a considerable military importance. It
was three times attacked by the British and once
taken by them. The strategic value of the island
which led to those attacks has not been diminished,
and the place should be at all times carefully guarded.
SO many wild stories have been. sent from Porto
Rico of late, most of them colored arid distorted
by partisanship, that it is gratifying, to have .the
salient features of the situation presented from an in
dependent standpoint by one who speaks with knowl
edge and with authority. ; Such a' presentation is con
tained in the recently published report of General
George W.. Davis, commanding "the Department of
Porto Rico.

FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
WITHDRAWS FROM HIS PARTY.
Hon. Owen Scott of Illinois Turns Against the
Aggregation Now Wearing Democ
racy's Label.
f CONSIDERABLE surprise has been
/ occasioned In Illinois by ther an-
I nouncement by the Hon. Owen
V Scott, a lifelong Democrat and
former member of Congress, of his
withdrawal from that. party and his de
termination to support the party of sound
money and good government. Mr. Scott
gives his reasons for deserting the Dem
ocracy In the following. statement:
Editor San Francisco Call: The Bryan
men are a party of negation. They have
but one positive opinion: They were
forced by their leader to declare for 16
to 1. And yet on this they discounted
their standing by resolving that another
is the paramount issue. On all other pub
lic questions they are simply "agin the
Government." They stand around and
wait to see which sfde the Republicans
take, and then take the other. They snarl
and find fault. They do not start out
with an affirmative policy, but undertake
to pull down those who go ahead to do
something. The aggregation now wear
ing the Democratic label Is a make-up
of every ism and faction which for twen
ty-seven years has had a grievance. Such
a motley combination is not Democratic.
No one can exactly tell what It is. Stev
enson came as near guessing It when he
called them "Bryan men" as any one did.
The Republicans are aggressive and pro
gressive, and the party is a world party.
The Kansas City platform is the Chi
cago platform with emphasis and varia
tions. Free silver, hostility to the courts,
the denial of the right of the President
of the United States to enforce Federal
laws without consulting Governor Altgeld
are some of the glittering jewels of wis
dom that are put forth as the fafth of
Democracy. It is not strange that men
who were reared as Democrats and
learned their patriotism from the great
Democrats of the past cannot bÂ© de
livered to the Democratlc-Populistic-SIl
ver Republican party.
There. Is an effort to shift the issues.
The Bilver question and the Chicago plat
form are to be obscured by declaring that
some convenient stalking horse is the
paramount Issue. The scarecrow of
imperialism has been set up to ob
scure the real and fundamental doc
trines of Bryanism. The gold standard le
the world standard. The insane policy of
coining fifty cents' worth of silver bul
lion from the silver-mine owner and giv
ing him a coin stamped $1 and a legal
tender for that sum is advocated as the
future policy of Bryan as President-
There is but one issue, paramount or
otherwise, in this campaign. . That is the
maintenance of a sound monetary system.
On this the Republican party is all right
and the sllvercrat party, or "Bryan men"
Are all wrong. As to the personality of the
candidates it may be said that they are
all honorable men. Bryan. Is conscientious
pi; ACTS disclosed by The, Call yesterday in rela-
I tion to the passage of a bill by the last Legisla
- > J : tare making it a misdemeanor to willfully and
maliciously cut or break any oil pipe line in this State
recall public attention once more to one of the gravest
evils that affect our legislative system. The bill in
question was not only an honest one, but was a desir
able addition to our laws, and yet to promote its pas
sage the advocate of the measure, Captain Frank Bar
rett of Palo Alto, was told by his attorney, Elwood
Bruner of Sacramento, that it would be necessary for
! him to pay $200 in addition to the $50 which Mr.
i Bruner asked as his own fee for drawing the bill.
The object for which Captain Barrett understood
the $200 was to be used is thus set forth by him:
"I employed Elwood Bruner Esq. as attorney to pre
pare a bill for the protection of oil pipe lines, for
which I paid him $50. Within a day or two Mr.
Bruner informed me that there. were so many bills
ahead of mine that it would be impossible to have it
passed unless I would employ : â , chairman of
Judiciary Committee, and Dibble, who was chairman
cf Committee on Rules, and each one would charge
$100. Acting on his advice I gave Mr. Bruner my
check for the amount to pay them. I received several
communications from Mr. Bruner subsequent to my ;
giving the check, both by wire and by mail, asking'
for more money, but I did not respond."
When requested by a representative of The Call to
make a public statement of his relation to the affair,
Bruner replied, "I authorize you to. say that I did not;
pay Dibble a dollar and did not tell Captain Barrett
that Dibble would charge $100." In considering that
reply the public will bear in mind that Dibble in the
past has defended Bruner when Bruner was hi
trouble, and, moreover, that Mr. Bruner as an attor
ney doubtless holds that his proceedings with respect
to the bill are to be kept under the veil of "profes
sional secrecy."
Confirmation is given to the statement of Captain
Barrett by the record of the Assembly and the Sea
ate, both of which show that the measure was ad
vanced for a time quite rapidly, taking precedence of
many bills that were on file before it. The speed was
such that the bill, read for the first time in the Assem
bly on February 3 and sent to committee on the 7th,
was returned from the committee on' February 16 with
the recommendation, "Do pass."
After making its way through the Senate with an
equal speed the bill went to the Governor, who pock
eted it, for reasons best known to himself.
Such is the story of this bill so far as known. The
charge it brings against Dibble will not surprise the
public. For a long time Dibble has been known as
"a smart man in politics and a crooked one." Hardly
any scandal has been exposed in the Legislature sine-
Dibble first entered that body without .showing him
either in the middle of it or under the shadow of it.
He has been in politics a long time, he knows all the
tortuous paths of its darkest recesses, he is acquainted
with all the tricks by which men may be corrupted,
he* thoroughly understands the nice distinction be
tween taking a fee as a lawyer to promote the passage
of a bill and taking a bribe as a legislator. By rea
son of that knowledge, accompanied with a habit of
making an unscrupulous use of it, he has become one
of the most dangerous of the evil personal influences
iti our politics.
We present the story to the public as one of interest
pertinent to the campaign now going on for the elec
tion of an Assemblyman in the Forty-first District.
Dibble, with all his scandals hovering about him, is
a candidate for re-election in that district. He seeks
to be chosen again as a representative of a con
stituency he has frequently betrayed, and of a party
whose confidence he lies abused. There is hardly any
form of legislative wrongdoing of which the public
has not good grounds for a moral conviction of- his
gtiilt, and his escape from legal conviction has been
due solely to his possession of a cunning equal to his
audacity and his falseness.
It rests with the voters of the Forty-first Assem
bly District to decide whether they will tolerate such
a man as their representative in the Legislature of the
State. They have the chdice of electing a young man
of good family and of known honor as well as ability,
or of electing again this man against whom a ne.v
scandal has arisen in addition to the many of .the past.
We can hardly believe good citizens will have any
hesitation in'making choice between such opponents.
The defeat of Dibble will rid. the Republican party of
â¢one of the worst leeches that ever fastened upon it,
and save the State Legislature from an influence that
has done almost everything to degrade it and nothing
to honor it.

UTTERANCE
Can any intelligent man doubt the truth of those
words? In the Southern wing of the Democratic
party there is an almost unanimous sentiment in favor
of imperialism, as it is called. Those imperialists hav
no respect for the rights of either brown or black
men. To accomplish the suppression of .the negro
vote in the; South they are willing to- combine with
free silver men or Populists or any other party that
will act with them. There have been many blind fools
in American politics at various periods, but ;the sin
cere opponents of imperialism . who vote for Bryan,
will be about the blindest of the lot;
Tammany Hall, intent on spoils and jobs and patron
age, in earnest and meaning business. All these must
be listened to and will be. Mr. Boutwell and Mr.
Schurz and the anti-imperialists will have served their"
purpose. They will have nothing more to do. They
have made good bait. The Democratic fishermen
will have done with them and will throw them back,

The case of Simon A. Hussey, an ex

a license as an expressman, was decided
in favor of Hussey.
L.. Bragamonte was convicted by Judge
Fritz on the charge of carrying a con

From a print In the Ellesmerr .
Manuscript of the "Canterbury v
Tales."
first of Englishmen to write with his eye
upon the object and he sketched not only
the externals but he saw to the heart of
things. He was keenly alive to the ludi
crous. He Is sometimes coarse and unpre
sentable, but ha never falls to make us see
beneath the ludicrous exterior the true
state of things- His Jolly pictures of tha
monk and friar and pardoner, for In
stance, at first arouse only a gentle merri
ment, but at length It dawns upon us. as
Chaucer skillfully intends it shall, what a
shame these men were to their profes
sions. Take, for instance, the picture- of
the mar:
"He was an easy man to givÂ» a penanca.
Because ha wished to gain a good plitane*.
For unto a poor order to have given
Is a sign that a man has been well shriven.
And if ht rave, he dared to make avaunt.
He knew at once the man was penitent.
For many a man ao hard hÂ« la of heart
He cannot weep though he> may sorely smart.
Therefore Instead of weeping and cl prayera
Let him give silver to the poor friars."
What a delightful rill of genial and
sparkling humor flows through the nun's
tale of the Cock and the Fox! Don Chan
ticleer and PerteloTe, hi3 wife, are
sketched with a master hand. The talo
begins with a dream from which Chanti
cleer awakes In horror.
"E*r God, I dreamed that I was in such a
alight
Just .how that even now my heart is sore
arrald.
I dreamed how that I roamed up and down
Within our yard when I beheld a beast
Like to a dogr. who would have made arrest
Upon my body and would have made me dead.
â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
Away! quoth she, fle on you, craven one!
Alas! quoth she. for by that God above
Now have you lost my heart and all my lova;
I cannot love a coward by my faith.
How durst you say for shame unto your lova
That anything might make you afraid?
Have you no man's heart and have a beard?
Alas and can ye bs aghast of dreams.
Nothing God wots but vanity is in a dream.
Dreams are engendered of repletion
Of gluttony and of humors."
But alas f<jr the dream! On a bright
March day long after the curtain lectura
had been forgotten the Cock suddenly
espied amid the weeds the object of his
terror. He was fleeing in dire haste when
the Fox gently called him and assured
him of his friendship:
"Now truly the cause of my coming
Was only for to barken how you sin?.
For truly you have as merry a voice
As any angel hath that is in heaven.
lly lord, your father. God his soul bless,
And also your mother with her irentlenesa.
Have in my house been to my great ease.
And certainly, sir. full vain would I you please.
Save you I never heard one sing
As did your father in the morning."
To make his voice more clear It was his
custom, declared the Fox, to shut hard
his eyes and stretch out his neck to its
full extent. The Cock, ravished by this
flatterj'. tried to crow In the manner of
his father and waa instantly seized and
carried away.
"O destiny, that may not be eschewed. "-'â¢ :
Alas that Chanticleer flew from the beams!
Alas that his wifÂ« recked nothing for bit
dream*!
And on a Friday happened all this ill."
Confusion at once broke loose.
i "Certes. such cry nor lamentation
Was never of ladles made when Illon wu won.
, But chiefly dame Pertelcte did shriek
Full louder than d!l Hasdrubale's wife
When that her husband had lost, his life."
The owner of the hens and her daugh
ters, startled by the tearful cry, add to
the din with:
â¢'Out*, harrowt and wellaway!
Ha. ha. the fox! and alter him they ran.
And alÂ«o with staves many another man.
Ran Cotte. our do?, and Talbct and Gerland.
And Malkln. with a distaf in her hand;
Ran cow and calf and also even the hogs
They ware so frightened at the barking dogs
And shouting of the men and women, too.
They yelled as fiends and devils do In hell;
The ducks squalled out as If they'd come to kill.
The geese for fear flew far above the trees:
Out rÂ»f the hive poured al! the swarm of bees.
So hideous was the noise, ah! benedlclte!
Certes Jack Straw and all his train
Made never shouts one-hal.' so shrill
When that they would a Fleming kill
As that day was made upon the fox.
Of brass they brought trumpets and of box.
Of horn, of bone, on which they blew amain
It seemed as U the heavens woeld fall."
A little presence of mind on the part o\
the Cock ends the tale. At his advice tho^
Fox opens his mouth to rail at his noisy
pursuers, and the lucky fowl flies quickly
to a tree, from which no argument can
dislodge him.
The main charm of this simple tale, of
which I have. given only thÂ» baldest of
outlines, lies In Us genuine humor. It la
not barnyard fowls that we see, but hu
manity with its petty erudition, its fears,
its superstitions. Its vanity. There Is no
bitterness; there are few bursts of reaM
wit. but through It all and over It all 7
spreads and quivers the lambent gleam of
a true- humor that cannot be caught, that
cannot be analyzed. All of Chaucer's tales
have this rare qualification. He was thÂ©
first great English humorist and his
charming tales live and will live as long
as human nature . and human weakness
can move the sympathies of men.

MAIL COMPANY'S CITY OF PARA RETURNING TO PORT. SHE LEFT
FOR PANAMA LAST THURSDAY, BUT HER MACHINERY BROKE
DOWN AND SHE HAD TO COME BACK FOR REPAIRS.
"How can j-ou bring fire and water
together without a hiss?"
At a certain supper of sheeps" heads a

he threw down his knife and fork and
exclaimed: "Well, say I sheeps' heads

Jerrold. who was present.
It fieems to be the essence of wit to
combine discordant Ideas In an unexpect
ed manner. The pun. therefore, or play
upon words, is the most common or all
forms of wit. After reading the modern
comic papers and listening to the Jokes of
the period, one may almost agree with
the witty Erskine:
"Punning." observed a friend to him
one day, "is the lowest form of all wit."
"It is,'* answered Ersklne. "and there
fore the foundation of all wit."
Most books of Jokes and bon mots con
sist largely of puns. Many excellent ones
are on record. "When Colman waa on his
deathbed his physician apologized one
day for his lateness by eaylng that he
had been called to attend a man who had
fallen down a well. "Did he kick the
bucket?" asked the patient.
"Ah. Martin," stammered Charles
Lamb one day at the whist table, "if dirt
were trumps what a hand you'd have."
Dr. Holmes, after an experiment with
amateur photography, wrote on the back
of ht? pictures. "O. W. Holmes and sun."
It Is related of Theodore Hook that one
day, missing a plate of cold tongue from
the sideboard, he appealed to his friend
Matthews as to what he would do under
similar circumstances. "If any one should
meddle with my tongue." replied the
wag, "why. I'd lick. him.'
Wit is concentrated. The reader cries.
' "a hit, a palpable hit." but humor Is dif
fusive. There is no outburst of laughter.
There is rather an inward glow of merri
ment, kindly and genial, which lights up
the countenance and softens the heart.
Humor deals with phases of human char
acter. It paints my Uncle Toby, or Sir
Roger de Coverly. or the Stout Gentle
man keeping close to human nature and
exposing their foibles and weaknesses
and peculiarities, but never with'bitter
ness. We smile over the picture, but we
are made to feel that it is a very human
fellow creature after all that we are
viewing â one that has hopes and fears
and ambitions even as ours. There is
but the thinnest of partitions between true
humor and pathos; indeed, as one reads
the pages of such consummate masters
as Fielding and Sterne and Dickens and
Thackeray one may at times wonder
whether the tears which he finds in his
eyes have come from laughter or weep-
Whlle wit is volatile and uncertain true
humor, since it deals ever with the truths
of human nature and human weakness.
Is unvarying and perpetual. Unlike wit. It
is bard to auote â sometimes it runs a
sparkling almost unnoticed streamlet
through whole chapters and books. One
cannot put his hand upon any single sen
tence or paragraph and say "It is here.
Like the delicate perfume *f a flower, it
can be appreciated ana feltT but It cannot
be isolated and labeled. For Instance. <is
one reads the old anonymous lyric. "Phll
lada Flouts Me." he cannot help smiling,
vet is there not a esthetic side to the
picture? I can quote , but a part of the
P Â° em " Oh.' what a rain Is lore!
How shall I bear it?
Â« She will inconstant prove.
I greatly fear it.
She Â»o torment" my mind
That my strength falleth.
And wavers with the wind.
As a shl? that salleth.
Please her the best I may
She loves still to gainsay;
Alack and well a day!
Phlllada flouts me.
â¢ â¢<â¢â¢Â¦
Fair maid, be not so coy.
Do Dot disdain me:
I am my mother's Joy.
Sweet, entertain me.
She'll give me. when she dies
All that 1Â« flttlrKâ
Her ixiultry and her bees
And her geese sittine.
A pair of mattress beds
And a bag full of shreds.
And yet for all this goods,
Phlllada flouts me.
I cannot work and sleea
All at a season:
â¢Love wound my heart 80 deep
Without all reason.
I grin to pine away,
" With" crief and sorrow.
Like to a fatted beast
Penned In a meadow.
I shall be dead, I fear.
, Within this thcusandy year;
And all for very fear,
Phillada flouts me.
Or, again, take Holmes' "Last Leaf."
with Its mixture of playfulness and
pathos:
But now his nose is thin
And it rests upon his chin
Like a staff,
And a croo!: Is In his back V
And a melancholy crack
In his laush.
I know it 1* a sin
For me to sit and grla
At bim here.
But the old hat
And the breecnes and all that
Are so queer!
And If I should live to be
The last leaf uoon the tree
In the spring.
Let them smile as I do now
At the old forsaken bough
Where I cling.
TWs is true . humor and it can never
lose its freshness and vitality.
Wit and humdr In the best literature
are. found always together. If wit Is the
sparkle and bead upon. the surface of the
wine humor is the delicate flavor and bou
quet, which time can only improve. "Hu
[ mor Is the electric atmosphere," says
"Ah, I envy you your happiness, my
lord," was the response, "for you must
certainly live the merriest life of any
man in Europe."
"And so you've -written a farce, entitled
â¢Firo and Water,' " said Bannister to a
friend. "Well. I can predict its fate."
"What is it? ' eagerly asked the author.
The English and American humoristsâ
Instantly the names of Theodore Hook.
Tom Hood. Douglas Jerrold. Artemus
Ward. Mark Twain and others of their
kind flash "before us. Almost without ex
ception we include In this Instantaneous
Inventory only that comparatively modern
product, the professional comic writer and
wit. A secon3 thought convinces us that
the subject is far broader than this â hu
mor Is the very life blood of all literature.
Its genial current pulses in every master
piece- A list of the humorists, with few
exceptions, is a list of the masters.
The impulse to class as humorists only
the Theodore Hook variety of writers
comes from a confu3icn as to the true
nature of wit and humor. Many bottles
of ink have been expended In attempts to
elucidate the distinction between these
terms. Hazlitt, for instance, has made a
long and profound analysis which ex
hausts both the subject and the reader.
But the distinction 'is by no means an
abstruse one: wit deals only with the
intellect: humor touches also the feelings.
"Wit is unsympathetic and often cruel; it
raises a laught at the expense of another;
humor Is gentle and sympathetic. It
smiles through its tears. Wit is a succes
sion of hits; humor Is often an atmo
sphere that pervades a writing and gives
It a charm that cannot be denned. Wit
Is the sparkle of newly opened wine: noth
ing is more volatile. The Jokes that were
,wont to set the tables of our fathers on a
roar are dull enough reading to-day.
There Is no more dreary volume than an
old Joke book. Wit will not bear trans
porting. German and French Jokes sel
dom make us smile; the dullness of Punch
is proverbial among Americans.
Wit flashes and sparkles. It Is often a
rapier contest between two agile con
testants; the last stroke wins. We laugh
with the victor, but forget that the
stroke we applaud may have sunk deep
into the vanquished.
Lord Chesterfield at an Inn complained
that the dishes were dirty.
"Every one must eat his peck of dirt."
coolly observed the waiter.
"True,*' was the Instant retort, "but no
one is obliged to eat it all at one meal."
A certain conceited peer oneÂ© observed
to Charles Townsend:
""When I happen to say a foolish thing
I always burst out a-laughing."
Haweis, "wit the Cash." In many Eng
lish authors the atmosphere of dry humor
Is always present and the flash comes but
seldom: In others there is a constant cor
uscation.
It is an old saying, half true, perhaps,
that the French have wit but little hu
mor. While it would not be safe to re
verse this dictum and say that the Eng
lish have humor and little wit It is per
fectly true that the element of humor is
greater in English literature than In any
other and that the English, despite- a well
known gallery of wags, are not a nation
of wits. Wit deals with the incongruous,
its whole foundation is the illogical. Bur
the English are pre-eminently a. logical
people: there 13 a necessity upon them to
be logical. But the English are a jovial
people. John Bull Is represented as a fat
man, and when at home, with every
thing running smoothlv. he loves to laugh
long and heartily. Mis laughter Is not
always perfectly refined. He delights
often in mere buffoonery and horse play
and at times he can be- unspeakably bru
tal, but he is. above all things else, a
man who worships "the go<i-of things
as they arÂ»." and he sees quickly the
stratum of pathos and of common human
nature that underlies all things grotesque
and ludicrous In human character.
English humor, like English literature tn
its modern sense, may r>e said to have
commenced with Chaucer. He was the

The three swimmers soon got tired and

Rev. Father James Otis Sargent Hunt
ihgton. member of the Order of the Holy
Cross, arrived In the city yesterday from
the East. Last evening he attended the
first of a series of conferences in tho
Church of the Advent on Eleventh street
and on the subject of "Christian
Character, the Best Thing in the World."
He was attired in the ciress of his order,
which much resemblea that worn by tin;
Dominicans. He says that it is the habit
of St. Augustine. It is all white for hou<e
wear, witn the exception of a black cord
around the waist. *i'he usual cowl is ln
cludfd. On the street the garments worn
are black.
A large audience was present at the
opening service and aliened attentively.
After the sermon services Rev. Father
Huntington was interviewed. He is a
young man Ftlll, although he has been in
the church work for some years. He does
not look to be over 31 or 32 years of age.
His manner is very auiet and earnest.
He said that there are only six members
of the order and thev are not all fully
professed. Another member may be added
next month. All members must take three
vows which are inexorable for life â pov
erty, chastity and obedience to the su
perior of the order. The purpose of the
order Is to promote personal holiness.
There was nothing selfish In the attitude
of the order, for all its acts are supposed
to be prompted by the Jove of God, which
forbids the idea of self.
All members of the order are priest*
In good standing In the Episcopal church.
The order had its beginning twenty yearj
ago and for ten years the work waa
largely among the Geiman population in
the East side of New York City. A
church, school and home, costing $60,000,
were provided by the Sisters of St. John
the Baptist. Ten years ago the call for
outride mission work Â» as so urgent that
the members withdrew from the east side
of New York and .went to Westminster,
Md., where a home was donated by 'Miss
Lucretla E. Van Bibber. One or more of
the members of the order Is always ab-

Father Huntington said he had been
largely engaged in rescue work among
women and girls. His purpose in coming
to San Francisco was to conduct a series
of conferences and also to counsel per

Two well-dressed young women were
arrested. last night by Detectives Dinan,
Wren and Crockett, who locked them up
in the tanks pending an Investigation into
the drugging and robbing of Frank
Rhodes Jr. of Sacramento.
Several months ago, Rhodes, who is
wont to travel the primrose path, met the
two women, who are known as Maud
Woods and Helen Adams, "on O'Farrell
street and consented to accompany them
to the Palmerlee lodging-hÂ»use on Ellis
street. According to his story after filling
him with whisky one of the women sum
moned the bell boy and sent him to pur
chase a phial of chloral. When the boy
returned with the poison Rhodes was
asleep, but he was soon awakened and
given a drink containing a portion of the
contents of the phial. In a few minutes
he became unconscious and did not re
gain his sonses until the following morn
ing.
Not finding the women in the room he
suspected Bomcthin'g wrong, and going to
a bureau drawer, wnere he had hidden his
diamonds, valued at about one thousand
dollars, he found them gone. Rushing
downstairs he met a policeman to whom
he told his tale of woe.
The policeman went to the house with
him, but failed to get a trace of the wo
men. Yesterday the detectives learned
that soon after the robbery the two wo
men went to a Jewelry store on-Kearny
street and pawned the diamonds, which
they had removed from their settings, for
J1C0. Several weeks later they told "Jack"
Abbott, a well known creature of the ten
derloin, of the robbery, and advised him
to redeem the stones, as they were very
valuable. Abbott went to the place and
secured the diamonds, wnlch he at once
proceeded to wear.
After the detectives had. taken the dia
monds Â¦ from Â» him . they â¢ arrested the two
women and locked them, up in the deten
tion ward of the City Prison. To-day they
will be formally charged with grand lar
ceny.

IMPOSTOR IN THIRTY-NINTH.
Upon Republicans With Petition.
Louis H. Cosper, a Democrat, Imposes
The Democratic "machine" in the Thir
ty-ninth Asseihbly District has been
caught In one of the cheapest frauds of
the campaign. In an effort to defeat
Frank D. Macbeth, the Republican nomi
nee for the Assembly, the' Democrats
have chosen one of their number, made
him pose as a Republican and have
thrown him forward as an Independent
candidate. By this means it Is hoped to
secure the election of M. C. McClain, the
regular Democratic nominee.
The impostor is Ix)uis H. Cosper, who
says he lives at 262 Golden Gate avenue
and 13 a "journalist." His erratic career
In "journalism" consisted in seeking ad
vertisements^ for the business departments
of newspapers. Mr. Cosper is a Demo
crat, not a Republican. He applied for a
position a short time ago as a Democratic
election officer. In his petition to the
Election Commission he stated that he
was a Democrat and his sponsor is Mayor
James D. Phelan.
In the face of this petition and the
notorious fact that he is a Democrat
Cosper has posed as a Republican, and in
circulating hie petition to be placed on the
official ticket as an independent he has
claimed to be a Republican. The fraud
has imposed upon many Republicans who
signed the petition under the delusion that
Cosper was acting In good faith. To carry
out the fraud Cosper has attended several
Republican meeting?. Republicans who
have signed his petition should remember
that a vote for him is simply aid given to
the scheme to elect the Democratic
nominee. - Â¦v-.l'SS'

THE boundary lines of thÂ» Forty
first Assembly District embrace
the finest resident sections of San
Francisco. The citizens dwelling
in the district are generally well
to-dn. They have expended large sums
of money In the construction of beautiful
horn.-s. In a large degree the p p ople re
siding there represent the refinement and
culture of the city.
It is the sejiFo of the citizens of the
Forty-first that thÂ«Â» district oupht to be
creditably represented in the Assembly of
the State Legislature, but obstacles to
clean representation have been interposed
by manipulating politicians. Henry C.
Dibble has been foisted so many times on
the* Republican nominating conventions
that the people have resolved to teach
Martin Kelly aiid the associated bosses a
lesson in politics.
There is an active and Increasing senti
ment in the district favorable to the elec
tion of Oscar Sutro to represent the For
ty-first in the Assembly. The fact is.
fresh in tbe minds of the people that Boss
Kelly procured the help of Democrats to
set aside the will of Republlrans at the
free-and-easy primary election, and as a
result of Democratic assistance Dibble
got a rÂ»-n<imination from the Kelly-Crim
mins B'nai B'rith Hall convention.
The Democratic convention at Odd Fel
lows' Hall nominated Mr. Sutro as can
didate for tbe Assembly in that district.
The Citizens' Republican convention,
which assembled at Shlels Hall, did; not
make an independent nomination, bur* did,
indorse the nomination of Mr. Sutro and
put him forward as the candidate of the
Citizens' Republican party. Two years
ago Dibble secured the indorsement of
this party and obtained 2016 votes, or a
majority of S55 over his Democratic oppo
nent. Isaac I. Rosenbaum. The only nom
ination accorded to Dibble in the present
campaign is the one that was bestowed
by the Kelly-Crimmins convention at
B'nai B'rith Hall. That convention was
the instrument of the bosses. Martin
Kelly himself was the leader on the floor.
He made the speech placing P. A. Berge
rot In nomination for chairman. Nothing
was done without Boss Kelly's consent.
Dibble, surmising that his own chances
would be imperiled by the conspicuous
exhibition of Kelly's personality, sought
to keep the Mint saloon boss under cover,
but Kelly administered a sharp rebuke to
the Assemblyman of the Forty-first, and
the subordinate made no further sugges
tions to the chief.
Oscar Sutro is a young man of ability
end energy. In the Legislature he would
reflect credit on the cistrict. His election
would redeem the district from the dis
grace cast upon it by Dibble's caieer in
the Assembly.
Oscar Sutro is the son of Emil Sutro.
banker. 40S Montgomery street. He was
graduated from the San Francisco Hign
School in 1SS1; and from the University
of California in 1894. He studied law at
Hastings College of Law. He entered the
office of William M. Pierson in la&5 anil
has been there ever since.
Leading Republicans of the district pre
dict Mr. Sutro's election by a substantial
majority, but such predictions have been
made before. While the well-to-do citi
zens and taxpayers of the district were
enjoying themselves at home or In agree
able* outings on election day the bosses
were drumming up voters for Dibble. Mr.
Sutro's election can be achieved by oi
ganized and energetic work in the line
of bringing to the polls every registered
voter and by ceaseless vigilance in the
work of detecting and exposing repeaters.
The bosses btfVe gained a firm grasp on
the Forty-first District an-1 will not let
go if they can by any means, fair or foul,
hold on.
Oscar Sutro is a progressive, enterpris
ing and capable young man. He enjoy?
the confidence and respect of the prop
erty-owners and taxpayers of the district.
It Is essential to his success, howevei .
tlirst ho shall receive something more
than words of commendation. In his be
half organization should be. perfected in
every precinct. The honor of the district
is Involved in the campaign because the
people of California are noting the con
test and wondering whether the continued
bocHllfng representation of the Forty-lirst
in the Assembly is a mere accident of
politics or the deliberate choice of the
residents of the district.
MORE FACTS ABOUT DIBBLE.
Â¦Waste Basket Scandal Recalled â Bar
rett Writes About Pipe
Line Bill.
The Call yesterday presented the facts
of another scandal in the legislative ca
reer of Henry C. Dibble and the good
citizens of the Forty-first Assembly Dis
trict now predict his defeat at the polls
on November 6. In 1S?2 The Call repub
llshed the story of the Â¦waste-basket scan
dal of the legislative session of 1S91 and
the voters of the district repudiated Dib
ble. The rejected candidate, however,
came, forward at subsequent elections
after the storm of popular resentment had
passed and quietly slipped back to the
Assembly. Republicans voted for him be
cause he was the regular nominee, never
suspecting that the bosses had manipu
lated affairs in advance to give him the
party nomination. Two years ago noth
ing was said In the public Journals re
garding his career of, crookedness in the
Assembly and the voters concerning
themselves chiefly in the affairs of the
campaign for Governor gave Dibble a ma
jority exceeding S00. He did not take into
account the fact that tiie waste-basket
episode had passed out of the minds of
the people, but rather assumed that thÂ«
majority which he obtained signified spe
cial commendation of his career. It id
well now to refresh the memory of the
citizens who dwell in' the Forty-first Dis
trict ajid in the light of the record ask
them if they want Henry C. Dibble to sit
in the Assembly as their representative.
There is no malice In thi*? proposition â
no spirit of hostility moves the paper to
the task, but a sense of duty to the pub
lic demands a reference to his career as
a public servant.
Henry C. Dib_ e was a member of the
Legislature of 1891. In March of that year
the waste-basket scandal came. He and
Assemblyman Marlon handled a .arge
sum of greenbacks in the private office of
the State Librarian. The bands that had
encircled the currency were found in a
waste basket, where Marion or Dibble
had thrown them. The affair was the
subject of official investigation by the
Legislature. Many surmised that the
handling of the money had some connec
tion with the Senatorial contest then
pending, wherein C. N. Felton and M. M.
Estee were leading candidates. The re
port of the investigating committee did
not solve the mystery of the affair, but
it did establish the fact beyond all doubt
that the money was not used or sent to
Sacramento for use in the Senatorial con
test.
O. B. Fogle, paying teller of th: Crock
er-Woolworth Bank, identified his own
handwriting of certain figures and words
on the bands which had held the pack*
ages of greenbacks. He testified that on
March 16, 1S91, he paid out $7500 in green
backs and that the hands exhibited held
the currency. He testified that the money
was paid to John B. Jones on a check
drawn by the Southern Pacific Company
on the Nevada Bank. The check was in
dorsed by the Nevada Hank. The witness
knew Jones by sight, but did not know
how Jones disposed of the money.
The presence of the lands in the waste
basket when Marion and Dibble were
seen handling greenbacks was regarded
at the time as convincing proof that Jones
gave the money to one or the other. It
was subsequently ascertained that the
srreenbacks constituted the Southern Pa
cific Company's contribution of $7000 to
defeat a bill which was supposed to be a
measure designed to "'cinch" the Western
Union Telegraph Company. Dibble and
Marion apportioned th-^ amount to certain
members of the legislature. Boodlers
who did not get what they fancied was
coming to them charged Dibble with un
fairness in the division of the spoils, li
was the deliberate judgment of honest
men that Dibble not only secured money
for his own influence 'in the Legislature
but also received money to divide among
others. He was accused of dishonesty In
the division of dishonest spoils.
Additional light on the latest legisla
tive scandal tends to show that Dibble
bad knowledge of Elwood Bruner's em
ployment to promote the passage of the
oil pipe line bill before the agreement
between Captain Barrett and Bruner waf
concluded. Under date of October 18 Cap
tain Barrett writes:
In reply to your telegram I have thought
over the matter very carefully. In the first
place the P. P. I-. Co. was and still Is largely
owned by stockholders in the Union Oil Com
pany of California at Santa Paula. I was a
stockholder, director and superintendent of the
P. P. Ij. Co. when Mr. Bruner mentioned to
me the necessity of employing Messrs. Dibble
and . I told him I would consider the
matter and advise him. I returned home and
placed myself in communication with the
president of the company at Santa Paula. I
was advised that any action I took the* com
pany would ratify. I returned to Sacramento
and stopped at the Western Hotel. I law Mr.
Bruner In the mornlne and had a conversation
with him about the "pipe line bill." He told
me that he would see Dibble and and
let me know In the afternoon. I had gone to
my room to take a nap and was in bed when
Mr. Bruner came Into my room. He told me
that he had seen the (rentlemen, and I had
better r>ay them each $100. [Up to this time
no question of paying Mr. Bruner had arisen
as he had told me in my first interview with
him when he accompanied me Jo the theater
as my Ruost that if he could srt-ve me at any
time he would be glad to do so.) I immediately
pot out of bed. took out my check book, wrote
a check for $250. handed It U> Mr. Bruner,
saying "There is J100 for â P 1100 for Dibble
and jr>0 for you."
That frveninr I left for home. About a week
afterward I went to f-acramento and found
nothing accomplished. I had a talk with l_>r.
Rowell and Senator Flint, and they Introduced
the bill. in the Senate. I at that time told Dr.
Rowell of the payment of the money. 1 do
not know Mr. nibble, never spoke to him in
my life to my knowledge, and ehould I meet
him would not know him. I spoke to Mr.
on tbe stairway in the Capitol building ar.d
asked him if I couM talk with him concern
ing the bill, and he asked me If It was the
bill Mr. Bruner had drawn up. I told him
ye3. He said it would be all right, or words
of l'.ke effect. I also told Representative Fair
weather about paying the money, and he told
me that I oucht not to have done It.
About a week prior to adjournment of I>><ls-
Iature Mr. Briiner both wrote and tele<?mph;Â«.1
me for more money, saying the bill would not
pass uniÂ«.s he received It. I paid no attention
to the demand, but I. however, sent Ills letter
and wire to the company's office at Eanta
Pajjla. The company wrote me not to pay
any more.
Elwoofl Bruner's denial that he paid
Dibble J100 was expected, but it must be
remembered that in the same breath he
denied that he ever told Captain Barrett
that Dibble would charge $100 The infer
once that the Assemblyman of the Fortv
flrst did not receive the $100 can only be
sustained on the theory that he was
bunkoed by Bruner. Dibble and Bruner
stood in together as far back as 1891, when
the latter had troubles of his own.
Dibble had everything so tied up in the
Committee on Rules that no. bill could be
considered unless he allowed it to go on
the urgency file. Old birds around the
Legislature were surprised when they
?^L, the new-fangled rules under which
Dibble could hold or advance any bill that
he preferred. It is safe to assume that
the next Assembly will not deliver the
goods to the Committee on Rules.

HOW A PLEDGE
MAY WORK ITS
0WN UNDOING
An agreement was made yesterday
morning between the poolse'.lers and Chief
Sullivan regarding the cases now pending
In the police courts that two would be
tried without a Jury and that no technical
points would be raised. The only points
to be determined are what constituted a
pool and Is the anti-poolroom ordinance
constitutional.? By this means the cases
may be speedily brought before the Su
perior Court. If the decision on appeal
Is unfavorable to the poolsellers they will
plead guilty in all the remaining cases
and a nominal fine will be inflicted on
their promise that they will stop the buÂ«i
ness of selling pools.
The first of the two cases agreed upon
was called before Judge Mogan Yesterday
afternoon. It was that of George Duncan
a clerk in D. J. Crowley"s pool rooms'
*iity jurors had been summoned and were
In attendance, when Attorney Joseph Cof
fey arose and notified the Judge of the
agreement. George D. Collins for the de
fendant said that the agreement had been
made without his consent, but he had to
submit.
The Judge notified the Jurors that their
presence would rot be required and the
case was at once proceeded with.
Policemen Proll and Larkln testified
in effect that they bought a pool from the
defendant on the McGovern-Dixon fight
This was all the evidence and the Judge
convicted the defendant and ordered him
to appear for fentence Mondav.
The other case, that of Harry Corbett,
will be tried before- Judge Cabanlss on
Tuesday with the same dispatch.
The cases of Harry Corbett, Walter Mc-
Inerney and William Daly were to have
been decided >m appeal by Judges Cook.
Lawlor and Dunne sitting in bank yester
day, but they intimated when the" cases
were called that they Â¦were not ready to
deliver judgment. The cases were con
tinued till next Friday, when it is expect
ed that judgment will be rendered.
The cases on appeal nf W. D. Valentine,
H. Muller. M. Burke and A. Pritchard.
convicted by Judge Cabaniss on the
charge of conducting a "clock game,"
came up before the same Judges yester
day for argument. Attorney Collins for
the defendants had not concluded his ar
gument when the court adjourned till
next Friday

rested for Perjury To-Day.
' Arrests are likely Â¦ to follow the\ filing
of the> petition to have an amendment
printed .on the ballots for the iiext elec
tion authorizing the Felling of pools on
sporting events. The petition contained
over 2u,uOO names and many of these it is
claimed are forgeries.
During the past few days Registrar of
Voters Walsh, suspecting that fraud was
practiced In obtaining signatures to the
petition, has been mak ng a quiet inves

to swear warrants for the arrest of sev
eral of the offenders.
. Before the petition was filed Thomas

attached to the petition and was subse
quently filed with the Registrar. Yester
day ofl looking: over the document ilie
Registrar discovered that the name of
Edward Hughes of 142 Silver street graced
it no less than four times.
"U'alen remembered that the same
Hughes some time ago appeared before
him and after announcing that he was
Illiterate, asked to be registered. Follow
ing the usual custom in such cases, the
Registrar had him make an affidavit to
that effect. At that time Hughes swore
that he could not read nor write, having
never attended school. An examination
of his supposed signatures to the petition
shows that they were written by some
body who could easily pass an examina
tion in penmanship before the Civil Serv
ice Commissioners.
Satisfied that the signatures were not
written by Hughls, Registrar Walsh yes
terday afternoon visited the Hall of
Justice, intending to consult with the Po
lice Judges as to the swiftest way to
prosecute the men who made affidavit
that the signatures to the petition were
bona flde. There was no Judge present
and the matter was left in abeyance until
to-day.
, Walsh Is wrothy over the discovery,
and it Is very piobable thnt he will swear
to complaints charging Wheland. Seidell
and Colnen with swearing falsely to the
affidavit which was attached to the pe
tition.

The preliminary examination of William
Schopplein. the boy charged with the mur
der of young James Brizzalare at Green
and Kearny street? Sunday September 30,
was commenced before Judge Conlan yes
terday. The evidence given by Henry
Kersten. a boy 12 years of age, living at 2
Kohler place, was of such a character
that the Judge came to the conclusion
something was wrong and continued the
case to Monday morning until a tran
script of the evidence given by the boy at
the Coroner's inquest could be procured.
Kersten contradicted himself with such
self-possession and nonchalance that he
was a marvel to the Judge and every one
in the crowded courtroom. Attorney De
voto specially prosecuted and ex- Judge
Treadwtll and Attorney Castelhun ap
peared for the defendant. rÂ« M oÂ«
Four bovsâ A. Baracina, 336 Green
Ptreet; John McGowan, 33S Green street:
John Fava. 'JZ'J\Â± Green street, and Albert
Davalle. 12W -Montgomery avenueâ had
given their testimony before Kersten was
called. Their testimony was practically to
the effect that they were all standing to
gether, when they saw Schopplein with a
gun in his hand. They ran for shelter and
heard a shot. Baracina heard some one
shout: "I^ook out; he is going to shoot.
They saw Brizzalare lying on the ground
and helped to carry him to a drugstore.
Schopplein was on top of the hill about
half a block away.
When Kersten wan called he began Dy
paying that he did not know Schopplein.
and in the next breath said that he had
given him his shotgun shortly before the
shooting. He and another boy were shoot-
Ing at a target, when Schopplein came up
and said. "Let me lopk at your gun." He
could not tell if the gun was loaded.
Schopplein had it for about three min
utes. He heard a shot go off. He could
not tell If he gave warning to the crowd
He could not tell If Schopplein discharged
the gun or not. He heard two sljots, but
did not know who fired them. He got the
srun bark from Schopplein after the shots
were fired.
When cross-examined by Attorney De
voto he admitted that he had been going
to and from the courtroom with the de
fendant's sister, but denied that she had
talked to him about the case.
"When you were examined at the Coro
nrr's imjuest," asked Attorney Devoto,
did you not testify that you shoutod,
"Look out. boys; he is going to shoot"?
Kcrpten at first denied that he had so
testified, but when propped by the Judge
said he was not sure. What he had testi
fied at the inquest was the truth. He ad
mitted that he had met Attorney Castel
hun at the Schopplein house, but nothing
was paid about the case. On Wedno.sdsiy
Mr. Schopplein took him to Treadwell's
office and Trr-adwoll told him to go to
Castelhun's office. He went there, but
nothing was said about the case. He had
to go \iith another boy. Castelhun Inter
rupted by remarking that he told him to
tell the truth.
"Did you not tell me," asked Attorney
Devoto, "In my ofllce that you yelled,
*IÂ»ok out, boys; he is going to shoot'?"
"I>on't know that I did, was the an
swer. Kersten said Detective Gibson had
called for the gun. In answer to the
Judge Korsten said:
"I heard both phots. There wrÂ« a lot
of rubbernecks gaping around and I was
looking to pee what I was going to do. 1
didn't take notice of Schopplein at all."
"There Is something wrong here," said
the Jurtgr, "and I will continue the case
till Monday, bo that a transcript of the
evidence given by the boy at the inquest
can be procured. It is Improbable that he
did not pee what was going on.'.'
When Kersten left the courtroom he
looked angrily at Attorney Devoto and
raid:
"I would like to knock that fellow's nut
off."

courts when the attorneys appeared b-;
foro United States District Judge Hawley
and raised the contention that as the
rules of the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals require that the defendant b<)
allowed fifteen days In which to ask for
a rehearing the court, violated its own
rules by issuing the mandate of extradi
tion before that period had elapsed.
Judge Hawley sent for United States
Circuit Judge Gilbert ;md after consulta
tion they announced thai they declined to
allow a stay of proceedings, they having
carefully considered the transcript of tes
timony in the case and having seen no
reason why they should grant a rehear
ing. The protest was accordingly dis
missed.

Graham, accompanied by Attorney
Peixotto, called upon Property Clerk
Esola with an order from Fuller for the
return of the property taken from him
at the time he was arrested. Esola In
formed them that unaer section 2, chap
ter 8. of the charter he could only deliver
the property to Fuller personally," as the
section distinctly read that it was not to
be given to an attorney or agent.
> Graham and Peixotto asked Captain
Seymour to instruct the property clerk to
hand over the property to Graham, but
the captain declined to Interfere, as the
charter was too specific on the subject.
As a last resource they waited on Chief
Sullivan. The Chief went with them to
the property clerk and instructed him to
turn over the property to Graham. Gra
ham got the property, giving his receipt
for It. along with Fuller's order.
Â¦ The attention of the Chief was drawn
to the fact that he had been guilty of a
violation of the charter; but he said that
he would take the responsibility, as the
section must be liberally interpreted. He
quickly changed his mind, however, and
sent Captain Norman to notify Esola not
to deliver the property except to Fuller,
but Graham had departed with It. The
Chief at once dispatched an officer with
Instructions to find Graham and make
him return with the property. In about
half an hour Graham, accompanied by
Fuller, who a short time before had been
too sick to appear In court, called at the
property clerk's office. Graham handed
back the property and it was thereupon
delivered to .Fuller, who signed the neces
sary receipt.
Osborne Fuller, the wealthy young Eng
lishman who so brutally beat his wife In
the Leepalmer Thursday morning and
was arrested for drunkenness, failed to
appear In Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day morning. His friend, Donald de V.
Graham. Deputy County Clerk, was in
court and told the Judge that Fuller was
too sick to appear. Fuller's ball of {5

Trouble Over Telephonss.
THERE was a flutter among rail
road men late yesterday after
noon over several .important
changes that are about to take
place in the personnel of the local
offices of the Colorado Midland and the
Union Pacific. H. C Bush, general agent
of the Colorado Midland in this city, has
been appointed traffic manager of that
road, with headquarters at Denver. Mr.
Bush will be succeeded as general agont
of the Colorado Midland by W. H. Daven
port at present genf-ral agent of the
freight department of, the I'nion Pacific
Mr. Davenport, who succeeds Mr. Bush,
was to have gone to Los Angvles as gen
eral agent of both passenger and freight
departments of the Union Pacific there,
but during his two years' stay in this city
hf> has become strongly attached to the
place and he preferred to make San Fran
cisco his permanent home.
Mr. Davenport has been with the Union
Pacific for thr past eleven years, nine of
which were spent In Los Angeles. The
vacancy created by his resignation will
be tilled by T. M. Schumacher, who, It Is
understood, will have charge of both the
freight and passenger departments In this
city. Mr. Schumacher is now in the East.
He recently resigned the vice presidency
of the Continental Fruit Express Coni
pany of Chicago. All the changes will
take effect November 1.
The promotion of Mr. Bush Is particu
larly gratifying to him, since he Is the
first to step into the newly created office
of traffic manager. *â¢

Mr. Rush hits been a railroad man for
the past thirty years. He started with
the Kmpire line and by his exceptional
executive ability worked his way rapidly
to the front until to-day he stands high
In the estimation of railroad men. He
left the Santa Ke in July to go with the
Colorado Midland. Mr. Bush has made
many warm friends in San Francisco and
his departure will be regretted.

PREPARATIONS for the monster
benefit to be given under the
auspices of the ladles of the Cali
fornia Club at the Orpheum Thea
ter Tuesday afternoon are nearly
completed. The programme Is replete
with bright and interesting numbers sup-,
plied by the best talent In the city, and
seats are in demand. The noble purposes
for which the entertainment is to be given
insure a liberal patronage and a hearty
success to the club's undertaking.
The receipts of the entertainment will
be donated to the social science depart
ment, which Is under the management of
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall. The social science
department is particularly attentive to
prison and hospital affairs, and the unfor
tunate inmates of both such institutions
have been the recipients of much favor
and relief through its efforts.
At the City and County Hospital the aid
extended by Mrs. Cornwall and her co
workers has been appreciated to such an
extent that six of its trained nurses have
consented to distribute programmes on
the afternoon of the performance, when
they will be attired in the neat regulation
costume of the professional nurse.

TWO POPULAR RAILROAD OFFI
CIALS WHOSE PROMOTION IS AN
NOUNCED.
Captain Harry Rethers, brother of Dr.
Theodore Rethers of this city? was also a
passenger on the Sherman. He was con
lined for two weeks In the hospital at
Tientsin and on the hospital Bhlp Relief
for a week. The voyage home on the
Sherman has greatly Improved his health.
Captain Rethers has an- enviable record
since first he donned the suit of blue. He
enlisted as a private In the Ninth Infan
try In 1S02. served for several years and
then successfully passed the competitive
examlnntlon for commission of second
lieutenant. Since receiving his commis
sion he has seen service In Cuba, the
Philippines and China, receiving frequent
ly honorable mention In the reports of his
commanding officers. In the assault on
Tientsin he served as lieutenant of Com
pany D, Ninth Infantry, and was brevet
ted captain for gallant conduct.
Private James M. Halnes, Company E.
Thirty-seventh Infantry, and Private
James H. Richardson, Company F, Thir
ty-ninth Infantry, were sick men when
thf> ship left Manila and died on the last
day of the voyage. The other soldiers
who died on the trip were at death's door
on the day of sailing and it was hoped
that the voyage would prove of benefit,
hut they succumbed. Their names are:
Peter Savery, Company B, Nineteenth In
fantry; John F. Carroll, prisoner, late
Company L, Thirty-sixth Infantry: Wil
liam Gordan. Company B, Engineer Corps-
William H. Morse. Company L, Ninth In
fantry; John M. Thompson, Company B,
Engineer Corps: Henry Sutter, Company
L, Thirty-second: Bert J. Emmona, Bat
tery K. First Artillery, Edward J. Ander
son, Troop A, Eleventh Cavalry; Edwin
Ellis, Company E, Forty-seventh Infan
try.
Four men died on the hospital ship Re
lief and their bodies, with the remains of
forty-two others who died In Manila, were
brought on the Sherman.
Several of the soldiers spoke of the
many valuable furs that were picked up
on the entry of the Americans Into
Peking. Fur capes, caps and coats of
great value were wcrn around the streets
of Peking by the men for several days.
On a call being Issued by the doctors on
behalf of the wounded men In the field
hospitals, who were suffering from the
cold, the men turned the warm garments
over to the Hospital Corps.
Lieutenant G. W. Lee, Thirty-ninth In
fantry, son of General Fltzhugh Lee, was
a passenger on the Sherman. He has
been in Manila with his regiment and was
Invalided home a sufferer from dysentery.
The other officers on the transport, who
were suffering from wounds, are Captain
Lang and Lieutenant Waldron. Captain
Lang was wounded in the battle of Tien
.tsin, having been hit by a shell in the
back, near the right shoulder. The X ray
was used at Nagasaki In an effort to lo
cate the fragments but without success,
and the captain was sent to this country
for treatment. Lieutenant Waldron car
ries his right hand in a sling as the result
of a wound received In the Â§ame engage
ment.
"A number of our boys owe their
wounds to the mistakes made by the Eng
lish and Russian gunners. Many of our
men who had endured the long march" and
had escaped unscathed the fire of the
Chinese and who expected to reach Peking
with their comrades were either killed or
wounded by this tire."
Jacob Schwoebel of Company M, Four
teenth Infantry. Is another victim of tho
fire from the allied forces. The English
gunners sent two shells in the midst of
our troops, wounding many of the boys
In blue, one of whom was Schwoebel.
Fragments of the shell struck him In both
legs and in the left arm, causing severe
wounds. When seen yesterday at the hos
pital he said:
Private W. R. Adams of Company E of
the Fourteenth lnfantcy suffers from the
fatal mistake made by the Russian gun
ners, who fired from the rear Into the
American ranks at the battle of Vangtsun.
A shell from ithe Russian guns burst In
the air directly over the head of Private
Adams and he was struck by the frag
ments. The entire side of his face was
carried away, disfiguring him In a horri

There were only thirty-four men who
were unable to walk to the hospital, and
their condition was not any worse than
it was on the day they left Manila.
Major Gibson, surgeon In charge of the
transport service, said yesterday while
superintending ;he removal of the men
from the ship: "Notwithstanding rumors
theso men are In as good condition as any
of -:he men we havs yet received from the
islands or from China. I>ysentery makes
terrible ravages upon the strongest of
men, and In a short time will reduce a
big, strong man to a mere skeleton. With
in a few days the majority of these men
will be discharged, as their condition will
warrant their return to their homes. This
disposition, of course, applies only to the
volunteers. The regulars will be kept
here, for treatment or restored to duty,
which will be determined by medical ex
amination."
For many days past the officers In
charge of the general hospital at the Pre
sidio have been making preparations for
the reception of the large number of sick
and wounded soldiers expected on the
transport Sherman. So complete were
their arrangements that It required but a
half day to dispose of the 637 sick, con
valescent and Insane soldiers that were
landed yesterday.
The condition of thjb men, considering
their long trip and the large number car
ried, is of the best. On their arrival at
the Presidio they were mustered into
squads and those In need of immediate at
tention were assigned to the various
warda in the hospital. Twenty-five per
cent of the men were found to be abla to
stand garrison life and these were sent
to the quarters about the reservation.
Most of the men on the vessel were from
Manila, and are suffering from dysenteryi
though many of them had mementoes of
the short but deadly strife In China. The
men who were carried or helped off the
McDowell at the Presidio wharf minus
legs and arms and suffering from wounds
were soldiers who participated In the fur
ther operations of the Ninth and Four
teenth Infantry after the taking of Tien
tsin. The march from Tientsin to Peking
was made under the greatest difficulties,
the advance being checked many times by
fierce engagements with the "Chinos."
Major Gibson Says the Men Look
as Well as Any That Have
Been Invalided
Home.
Are Cheerful, Although Suf
fering From Wounds
and Disease.

The committee will bring the matter of
the campaign before the meeting of prin
cipals to be h'ld next Monday.
The campaign committee appointed yes
terday at the mass meeting by C W.
Mark. who presided, is composed of
;..Â¦-:.-. Brooks. Josenh O'Connor. Mrs.
Mary Prap. T. H. McCarthy, and the
litigation committee that engineered so
successfully the negotiations with the
merchants for the balance in the school
treasury a year ago. This committee is
composed of Colonel C. H. Murphy, \V. D.
Kingshury. Miss Emma Stlncen.'Mrs. L.
K. Burke and Louis de F. Bartlett. The
committee met immediately after the
mass meeting and organized by the elec
tion of Colonel Murphy chairman, W. D.
Kingsbury secretary and Elisha Brooks
treasurer. Tlu re was some discussion as
to the plan of work and then the work of
preparing a circular was left to the chair
man and secretary. A press committee
composed of \V. D. Kingsbury, Joseph
O'Connor. Mrs. Prag and Miss Stincen
Â«'af appointed.
The trass meeting yesterday war repre
sentative, but not large, and it was con
sidered that all the teachers would be
willing to agree to any measure decided
upon at the meeting and would be
Â¦willing to contribute in anv wav the
meeting should see tit. . It was decided to
appoint a committee of nine to take up
the matter of the campaign, and do
whatever was considertd necessary to
...-.-â¢Â¦ in favor of the amendment. *
Kor funds it was decided to asses? the
teachers in proportion to their salaries.
Those who receive 1200 a month and more
will pay $3; those who receive between
iV.v and $:?Â«â¢ a month, $2: those who re
ceive Icfs than SlltO, II. it is believed this
will make a fund sufficient for ail the
purposes of the campaign.
The work cf the campaign will be di
rected toward securing a correct knowl
edge on the part of the voters as to what
lh< amendment is, and what its effect
will be. Jt is desirtd to remove the im
pression that with the teachers" claims
will he included a batch of illegal claims,
which will all be put through under the
amendment. There is nothing provided
for but the claims of the teachers and
those of the merchants whose claims
nave been allowed by the Supervisors,
and their payment will be charged upon
the city and county of San Francisco
<;ily. . The amendment goes no further
than to pive power to the Supervisors to
appropriate sufficient mon<\v to pay those
Claims which they are willing to aliow of
those that are hanging over from 1*"S7 and
2*9*. and the amount allowed by the
amendment is limited to $5n>t/Â«iO.
Thpre was a mass mopting of teachers
la th<* Mission Hieh School yesterday
aft*>rnonn to inaugurate the campaign for
the passage of constitutional amendment
Dumber fifteen, the one which, if passed,
will enable the Supej visors to pay the
back salaries the School Department has
held nut from Its employes.
There is Is all about $130 .Ouu due the
teachers, but there is no way for them
to get it except by a constitutional
amendment, and number fifteen was
crawn up to meet the occasion.

No Other Person Has So Wide An
Experience with Woman's Ills,
Nor Such a Record of Success, â
"A Woman Best Understands a
Woman's Ills." â Her Advice Led
Maggie Farrell to Health.
Examination by a male physician is a hard trial to a delicately organized
woman. She dreads the humiliation of it alL
She therefore puts it off as long as she dare, and is only driven to it by fear
of cancer, polypus, or some dreadful sickness.
Most frequently such a woman leaves a physician's office, where she has un-
dergone a critical examination, more or less discouraged.
This condition of mind destroys the effect of advice, and she grows worse
rather than better.
In consulting Mrs. Pinkham, in person or by letter, no hesitation need be
felt. The story is told to a woman, and is entirely confidential â to a woman
â¢who has listened to thousands of similar stories â and who is so competent to
advise women because of vast experience, and because she is a woman. Her
advice is absolutely free to all sick women, and her address is Lynn, Mass.
Bead Miss Farrell's account of how she was sick, and was lead to health
by Mrs. Pinkham. She is only one of thousands whom Mrs. Pinkham has
cured this year.
Female Weakness Relieved by Mrs, Phskham.
" I take pleasure in writing you a few lines thanking 1 you for your advice. I
did just as you told me in taking your medicine, and owe my life to you. You
are like a mother, to your sex. I was awful sick, was all run down, and felt
sick all over. I looked like a person brought out of the grave. My face waa
as white as the driven snow. I was always tired after doing a little work, and
would have to sit down. I had terrible pains and headaches, and my appetite
was not good ; also, troubled with shortness of breath. I could nob go up one
flight of stairs without being tired and having to stop to get my breath. I waa
feeling just as miserable as could be. I took two bottles of your Vegetable
Compound, and cannot express my thanks to you for what your medicine has
done for me." â Miss Mamie Farrell, 35 Devon St., Grove Hall, Boston, Mans.

The repression noted Is, perhaps,' most promi
nent in the Iron and steel 'industries, where
values for ' the -cruder materials remain - well
down to the lowest point reached in more than
a year past, and even here.it may be noted
that a larger volume of rail steel orders have
been placed this year than In former periods.
Sales thiÂ« week of rails are estimated at 15,000
tons, mostly at the West. Structural material
makers are reported exceptionally well fixed
as to orders, although . a meeting of makers
it Is rumored, may cut rates. Pigiron has been
slow of eale, but Chicago : reports that a busi
ness of at least 100,000 tons is in sight that
may be placed after election. : The large steel
mills are well supplied - with orders. Chough
at low prices and the usual scramble for fall
business is absent this year.
Wheat, Including flour, ehlpments for theweek

Prices of farm products have tended down
ward this week. The most notable drop - hae
been In cotton, half a cent for the week,' and
one cent from the highest point reached, due to
the eood picking weather and absence of frost
encouraging maximum estimates of yield, but
also because of the heavy weight of receipts
brought out by the high- prices of two weeks
ago. ..
Eastern wholesale trade Is quiet but steady.
Grope railway returns continue excellent, con
sidering the reports of quiet In all other lines,
and net returns for August are much more en
couraging than those of July. The country's
foreign trade is In flattering condition, Septem
ber exports being the largest ever reported for
that month, and. swelled by the high prices for
cotton shipments, the nine months' returns
are far in advance of all previous years. Im
ports, on the other hand, show few gains and
the outlook Is for a record-breaking export
trade af d a merchandise I balance for the cal
endar year far In advance of all other years.
As the Jobbing distributive . trade tends to
lesson with the advance of the fall season, the
repressive Influences of ante-election feeling
becomes more clearly t>ercentible and the re
sult fe a generally quiet, though at the same
time confident, feeling In general trade, which
the stock market has apparently begun to dis
cour.t, with the result of swelling current bank
clearings well above recent totals. As for some
time past the best trade advices come from the
South, which remains cheerful In spite of
lower cotton. Pacific Coast advices are that
export trade Is very larse as the result of
army needs ajid Asiatic requirements. North
western trade Is on the whole quiet, and the
disposition to charge the election with this Is
manifest.

CHICAGO, Oct. 10.â At the outset and during
most of the forenoon the paramount Issue In
wheat was to be found In the Argentine ship
ments. 260,000 bushels, compared with 944,000
bushels In the week previous, and the resultant
advance at Liverpool in the face of the decline
here yesterday. December opened He higher at
74H to 74%O74Hc. but this advance was suffi
cient to get scalpers after profits, as they were
mostly bears anyway, and a drop to 74i;<ii74Â»4c
followed. Their offerings were well taken by
T^ rt K , how 7"' and a rally to ?4Hc ensued.
This bulse Was poorly supported and the large
receipts caused further despondency under
which Dec*ynber slumped to 7iÂ»i@74i.ic. Here
the market again steadied and reacted to 74Â»ic
at which it closed, a shade over yesterday '
Corn ruled easy for October, but nrm for de
ferred futures. Trade was fairly active De
cember closed V*c higher at 35%c.
Hardly anything was done in oats. Decem

ribs 7&@10c improved.
The leading future.3 ranged as follows:
Any acute apprehension about the money
market was relieved by the large amounts of
gold which New York bankers produced abroad
and which are on the way to this country. The
pum total of the present gold Inflow is over $9,
000.000, and though this amount is little greater
than the shipments of money from New York
to the Interior In some recent weeks, the ef
fect, even In advance of the specie's arrival,
was decidedly favorable. Owing largely to the
gold Importing arrangements and to a falling
off In the supply of cotton bills, foreign ex
chanre recovered this week from Its recent
break, and is again at a point which cuts off
further gold Imports. The fact, however, that
in case of danger to our money market assist
ance could be had abroad, could hardly fall
to give increased confidence to the financial and
speculative markets. In this connection Wall
street was particularly struck by the announce
ment that the Bank of France would put no
obstacle in the way of moderate gold with
drawals for shipment to New York If they were
nepded here. It Is also noted with satisfaction
that though some of the specie now on the
way hither was taken from the Bank of Eng
land or France most of the shipments repre
sent amounts of bullion picked up In the open
markets, and one' Important sum of $2,500,000

ment consists of bar gold from South Africa,
The operations. In short, have been conducted
In a way which has obviated any disturbance
of the foreign money markets, discounts at
both London and Berlin being a little lower,
and fear of a disturbance caused by American
demands for payment of Its credit balances has
been allayed. This, however, does not result
in any Increased foreign participation in our
stock market, and London has ever been a
email seller of securities on the advances which
Â¦were recorded here.

NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â There was a very ac
tive mej-ket for a^l claepe* of stocks to-day, in
which the bu!! element early secured the upper
hand and maintained It with growing Eiica-^s
throughout the day. The riyÂ» in prices was po
considerable ae to invite free profit-taking dur
lns the cioeing hour of the market. Hut new
stocks were pirked oat for an advance with
each good effect i>n the pcneral list that it was
able tc absorb a very lirre amount of the
offering* before any effect began to be pro
cured. Prices ran off somewhat in the nr.al
dealings, reducing extreme RaJns to a consider
ed" extent and carrying a few stocks, includ
lnp yonie of the leading Industrial*, below last
r.ijkiu. Tlie market was thu6 made Irregular
and very active, but the average level of prices
waÂ»> considerably hiph'er as a result of, the day's
tra/ilnir. The advtLnce Â»a contested during
the earlier part of the day, but not as vigor
ously at yesterday. No further effect was pro
cured than to check the advance in tome quar
ters without causing an actual decline. The
bear opposition appeared to be withdrawn.
when the course of xiriees turned clearly in
favor of the bulls and some of the interests
Â¦which were Fellers yesterday turned to the
buying fide. A fart that could not Â«*scape no
tice wa* thst yesterday's rumors of further
plans of amalgamation o f the Vanderbilt prop
erties was heard nothing of to-<iay suid the con
certed advance in the group camÂ» to an end.
It ni notaMe also that yesterday's upward
ras-h in the steel stocks was der'sted from to
day and mest of the group endÂ«Â»d with net
losses, the important exceptions being the
American Hoop stocks. tne Colorado F*uel
nocks and National Tube. Sugar and People's
Mar were affected y, y realizing. This turning
from poe fotnt in the market to another Is a
characteristic feature of professional operators
ar.4 majiipulatlve processes., which clearly
played a larpe j^rt In to-day's market, but it
Â¦was equally clear that the professional manipu
lation for the rise had large success In attract
ing cut.-idÂ» buying.
Special points of strength were Atchiscn pre
ferred and '.he Grangers and Southwesterns,
Northern Paclnc. Southern Pacific and Man
hattan Trith thÂ«> other local traction stocks fol
lÂ»w!ng In eympathy. The news of the day had
little to do with the advance..
Preliminary estimates of the week's cash
changes of the barks were decidedly confused.
The direct shipments by express to the Interior
and tho operations )n banks with the New York
pufctreasury indicates a less In cash of $708,000.
This take? no account of the gold which hÂ«s
arrived from Europe this v.eek and which may
}*> too late tc figure prrminÂ»ntly in to-morrow's
"statement. This would threw the effect of the
void imports over into nÂ«*xt week's statement.
The activity in the stock market seems to in
dicate that an expansion of loans on the stock
eschars have conic largely from the trust
companies, which drfw their bank accounts to
recure their funds. There is thus a possibility
of shrinkage In the <5eposits and consequently
In resoi-i-e. requirements which will be to the
advantage of the surplus.

NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
"The markets here were improved by pros
pects of easy money and the Indications of an
early settlement In China. Investment securi
ties were the chief beneficiaries. Speculation
was on a email scale, except In Americans,
which, though quiet In the early trading, fin
ished buoyant and noisy on New York support,
The bank sold Â£143.000 gold In French coin,
probably finishing a former transaction. The
ojien market demand is slackening. Money
rates were unchanged. Silver was bought for
the East on good trade orders."

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
A settlement of the coal strike, satisfactorily
to all Interests, having been effected, business
breathes more freely In the East and distribu
tion of merchandise Is increasing slowly again,
though the election excitement keeps new buy-
Ing In many lines down to wants for Immedi
ate consumption. In the West there Is not
the same hesitation and there as well as In
the south the marketlng-of the crops Is re
sponelble for a feeling of much confidence In
the movement of business If the nation acts
conservatively at the polls. Prices of com
modities are weaker and the caution so grati
fying In a Presidential year keeps speculation
at>a minimum.
Cotton further declined, making the loes about
(6 a bale in two weeks. Planters aro rushing
work and picking Is expected to progress rap
idly enough to save most of the crop from
early frost. High prices make it possible to
pay good wages to picker* and the movement
at receiving points Increases largely. Domes
tic spinners are not liberal buyers, but exports
are only slightly smaller than a year ago.
Wheat has shown raore weakness, due in part
to the greater aotivrty at Russian ports an.l
Atlantic exports for the week were only 2,647,
2S5 bushels, against 3.270,228 a year ago.
Few imnortant fluctuations occurred in Iron
and steel, but there were small advances In
beesemer pig at Ptttsburg and billets at Phila
delphia. Moderate gains are reported In the
volume of transactions, although the tendency
Is to delay large contracts a few weeks. Im
plement makers take bar iron freely, how
ever, and orders for pipe are urgent, with
severe weather coming on. Structural shapes
arÂ« taken for forelcn points as fax distant aa
Egypt and domestic bridge builders buy freely.
More mills have gone into blast and the gen
eral tone is improving. Production of coke has
increased, but prices are easy and many ovens
still idle. Tin declined again, making the fall
l&c in two weeks and 6c from the high point
In July.
Leather and hides are firm and selling freely
because of steady Improvement In demand for
boots and shoes. Jobbers are placing large
orders with manufacturers and demand Is no
longer limited to fall goods. Spring contracts
are increasing at an encouraging rate, although
an effort Is made to keep these sales as quiet
as possible, owlnc to the effect on the market
for raw material.
While woolen mills are not working at full
capacity, more seasonable weathers-has in
creased buying in this line and purchases of
wool at the three chief Eastern markets ln
creaEed to 4,524.000 pounds, the best total for
a long time, although still far below the
amount taken through speculative activity a
year ago. Prices are steady and holders/show
no less confidence.
Failures for the wpek were 209 in the United
Sta.es against 145 last year, and 26 in Canada,
against 20 last year

a Deal.
OAKLAND. Oct. 19.â Major C. C. Clay,
the well-known Fruitvale capitalist, and
Robert Cords, a Frultvale real estate
dealer, have fallen out over a transaction
which, according to Notary p. H. Blake,
who made the acknowledgment,' may be
thÂ«" baais-of a Grand Jury investigation
or a suit in the courts. The question is
whether a deÂ«-d to the former terminus
at Frultvale avenue, made, according to
the records, by Major Clay and his. wll's
to Mrs. Cords, and then to Cords, ts a
\alid one and executed by both the cap
italist and his wife. The tangle has got
to such a shape that inquiries have been
made at the County Recorder's office con
cerning the various transactions, while
Major Clay, who finds himself minus th3
property. Is wondering what has oc
curred. Notary Blake has a part In the
affair, because he made acknowledgment
to the transfer from the Clays to Cords,
accepting a subscribing witnese signature
to the grantors* signatures Inptfad of tho
pÂ«r>Â»onal appearance of the makers of W12
deed.
I The stnry as related to-night by Notary
i Blake is as follows:
"Major Clay had a verbal agreement
with Cords to clear title with the Oak
land Transit Company to the property,
which for tÂ«Â»n yearg had been In their pos
session. Now Clay has threatened to go
to the Grand Jury and to demand an in
vestigation.
TCARL SPELLING, attorney-at
law, made an assault upon the
works ot opposing counsel with
0 a ledger as a weapon during
the hearing of the action in
stituted by Harriet Mallett against the
Life Annuity Association before Judge
Troutt yesterday. For this breach of pro
fessional etiquette and assault upon the
dignity of the bench he must pay a fine of
$100 or repent tor his sins with live days
behind the bars of a prison. In the In
terim the assailed counsel, William Lair
Hill of Oakland, will receive the con
gratulations of his friends on the fact
that Spelling's threat to "bang him on
the head" was nipped ere It had fairly
budded. , -
For nine years the suit named has
at the court's stand and again referred
to the papers. Spelling quickly grasped
a ledger and charged to the assault.
'Til bang you on the head for your
lies" shouted Spoiling. He swung the
book at Hill, but the Oakland lawyer de
serted his base and retreated. Spelling
was stopped by the balMff. the book was
wrenched from his grasp and he was led
to the bar for the judgment of the court.
"For your contumacious conduct and
language." said Judge Troutt, "1 adjudge
you guilty of contempt of court. For your
conduct I fine you $100, in default of pay
ment of which I order you into the cus
tody of the Sheriff for five days "
Spelling remarked that he would take
the jail, aa he did not have the hundred
dollars. Judge Troutt then granted a
stay of execution for one week In order
that Spelling. might dig for the coin Next
Friday his fate will be finally determined
dragged in and out of the local courts.
Harriet Mallett, with many others, has
sought to compel a return to her of money
>she alleges was misappropriated by the
Life Annuity Association board of direct
ors. From time to time, and many, many
times, pleadings In the case have disap
peared. With each disappearance Spell
ing find Hill would cast reflecting glances
at each other. Yesterday It was Hill's
opportunity to argue the case. He open
ed with a few points of law and then
drifted Into the matter of the missing pa
pers. He intimated that perhaps Spelling
could tell a thing or two about the pa
pers. Spelling warned him not to repeat
his Insinuations if he valued the present
contour of his physical being. Judge
Trouttwarned Spelling to cease Interrupt
ing counsel, as an opportunity to reply
would be given him. Hill took courage

Proceedings of the Water Case
Include Testimony of Several
Councilman Who Make
Good Showings.
Â»
OAKLAND. Oct. 19.â "Public officials
cannot he brought here and treated like
criminals," was Special Counsel Hayne's
indignant proUst to-day against the man
i:er in which the water company's at
torneys were examining witnesses.
Judge Hart was again compelled to heed
the voice of objection and to demand
from Attorney McCutcheon that different
tact'.cs be employed.
With the frequent battles to keep
the combine's lawyers within bounds, and
the sharp rattling that Attorney Mc-
Cutchcon got in trying to drive Council
man Kdwln Mccse into a corner, there
was enough excitement to relieve the dry,
dull, monotony of repetition which marks
the water compuny's prosecution of its
case.
Councilman Meese was a notable ex
ception in the list of his colleagues In
point of clear, direct combat against the
corporation's eminfnt legal represent- i
atives. He, with Mott. Glrard and Stet- '
ton. have so far curried off the palm for |
keeping cut of bad corners. Mott, to the j
surprise of himself ami his feliow Cou;i- |
clltnen; w;;s not examined upon his i
knowledge' of the- water rate question, j
The company's lawyers shied at tackling â¢
him to-day, but whether they propose to j
go at him on that Bubject later is a se- |
cret they have not disclosed. Mott was J
excused, aft.-r being questioned about a
published interview, but With the under
standing he might be rec. tiled. His in
timate Knowledge of the subject is said
to be the re-ison for the attorneys' inde
cision upon the question oj an attack.
Every mftnber of the Council has now
been through tht mill except Schaffer.
Judgo Hart amended the order directing
the water company to produce the I'itch-
Liurg pumping plain records.
Ttien the grist for the day was opened
by Councilman Taylor, who was some
what negative concerning his method of
determining a valuation on the water
company's plant, hut was very forceful j
In explaining why he had eliminated the
Oakland tDingfe.) Water Company's
plant from consideration. That fateful
admission of President Watkinson that
the Contra Costa Company had always
been al>l* to supply suifielenl water ior
the city bobbed up in Taylors testimony
to haunt the corporation like Banquos
ghost that would not down.
Mr. Taylor was asked by McCutcheon:
"What 'evidence did you consider before
you decided upon what water rates would
yield a fair return to the company?"
"Among other matters, Mr. Watkinson
appeared before the Council committee of
the whole." replied Taylor, "and read a
long- statement. The Councilmen ques
tioned him at great length. 1 asked him
if the Contra Costa plant had ever been
insuilicient t j supply the city, ami he re
plied that It had not. I asKod if it was
now sufficient, and he replied that it was. j
Thnt was the reason I was in favor of j
considering only one plant In fixing j
rates."
"Hut Mr. "VVatkinson was asking that
both plants be considered in the fixing of j
rates'.-"
"He thought the city should be willing !
to pay rates covering both plants because I
In some unforeseen emergency both planes
would be needed."
Councilman MeÂ«Â»se was subjected to a
hard examination by Mcuutcheon and
Moore.
"1 accepted the report of the special
committee of 1*1*5, " explained the witness,
I was informed by the gentle
men who a. c : ; i.sted in compiling 1t that
thÂ«*y had engineers to secure data."'
Then there was a. r.Â£ht about Meese's
signed interview whicn William J. Din
gee pulled out of an envelope of which he :
has been the careful custodian since the
trial began.
Mr. Hayne made objtetlon to the docu
ment, but it was overruled.
"It was a dastardly piece of business,"
then declared M^cse.
"Do you inean." asked McCutcheon, i
"that it was foolish fcr vou to express |
your views?"
"No: but any man of intelligence can :
see what that interview was procured for. Â¦
It was foolish for me to make it because J
uf the use to which it is being put."
Meese explained that portions of his
Ftafrrifnt had been cut out and that the
published article left - ne water company '
a chance to pat interpretations upon it {
which could be usod aeainst him. i
Then McCutcheon called Councilman |
Mott and. to tho amazement of the lobby. I
started off Â¦with the signed Interview that i
Dingey handrd his attorney from that ]
same omlnouF paper puueh.
After identifying l.is signature Mr.
Mott explained: "When that paper was j
broucht to me. some time after I had an
Interview with the reporter. I read !t hur- I
riedly and started to rewrite part of it. :
But I found that I did not have sufficient
time to do that, so I signed the statement j
with the absolute understanding: that cer
tain matter pertaining to wat<r rates was !
to be cut out..
"I never made ruch Statement:-! as are i
contained in the article about engineers
and that sort of stuff. As I tell you. I i
trusted to the reporter to cut It otit. Of !
course, it wag a careless thin* to sign the j
statement, but I presumed that the mat- j
ler would be left out as I directed."
Councilman Rowe was questioned brief
ly and court was adjouTÂ»d until Tuesday
before his examination vras completed.

HAYNE COMES TO
OFFICIALS' RESCUE
ALAMEDA, Oct. 13.â The dinner hour at
the residence of John A. Hammersmith of
2TH2 Eagle avenue was full of sound arl
fury last evening and ended in furniture
and crockery being broken up in largo
.quantities. Mrs. Hammersmith, wluue
huÂ«har.d is the well-known sportsman aÂ»;il
leader of the Olympic CSub, and the hired
man. Teter Innes. were arrested for ba'.
tery after things had quieted down, at
the instance of Miss Emma Ohlson. the
servant girl, who was at the root of all
the evil. To-day the trials of the arrested
persons went on before Justice of thd
Peace Morris.
It seems from the variegated testimony
th.it just as the Hammersmith family was
about to partake of the first course of
their dinner last evening Miss Ohlson was
called to the telephone to answer a man's
voice. Miss Ohlson started in to maka
a "date." Mrs. Hammersmith forbade tre
girl going out. The girl stamped her
pedals down and said she would go out.
The lady of the house repeated the order
with more emphasis. In reply Miss Ohl
son smashed two fine china plates on the
hearth.
After this little Incident the hired man.
Mr. Innes. was railed in. Aided by the
Hammersmith family, consisting of hus
band, wife and son, he p*tt the recalci
trant girl into the pantry, locking the
door. This coup was made somewhat easy
by reason of the fact that Mrs. Hammer
smith poured a pitcher of ice water over
the servant erfri. as she Â«airt. "to cool
her down." Miss Ohlson dM not stay a
prisoner long, for with the aia nf a sledge
hammer, reinforced by her hands and
feet, she knocked a panel out of the door
and gained her freedom. Then she cams
to the police station and swore out war
rants for the arrest of her assailants.
Mrs. Hammersmith and the hired man
were brought to the police headquarters
by Constable Clarke in a carriage, as the
former would not submit to the indignity
of walking with a "cop."
Miss Ohlson was quit^ dramatic durlnj;
the narration of her alleged wrongs on
the stand. She worked herself up Into
several kinds of spasm and once the court
had to dash stimulants and ice water into
her face to keep her cooled down.
Justice Morris dismissed the ense be
cause he thought there had been blam9
on all parties to the- melee.

BERKELEY, Oct. 1?.-The qmstlon of
exempting church property from taxation
caused much discussion at the synod of
i "ai.r-irtiia. this morniiip. The subject was
brought uj> by a report from a commute.
appointed to look into the status of thv
tffort to relieve churches of that expense.
Dr. J. W. Dinsmore, chairman of the
<- 1 !nmi:tÂ«e, presented the report, reviewed
the work which has been done in canvass
::.g the State, and in speaking of the
;>ians of the committee regarding this
amendment, read the following resolution:
Resolved. That every m< l rr.ber cf this Bjrood
here i'res*-nt pledge himself to make it his
perecr.al t>us:titFs to Lave this imr'jrtant mat
ter brought before his congregation, in what
he r^jarJs the mct^t effective mi-nriT, liefore
election <2ay, exiOain:r.g it and urging up'in
evtsy voter to vote for this amendment.
Dr. Dinsmore supplemented his report
by an address presenting reasons why this
amendment should be supported. The
;;rgument for exemption was made on the
ground that churches arere public institu
tions, purely philanthropic, supported by
the voluntary contributions of those who
did not expect anything in return. They
ask that they lÂ«e not made to pay for the
privilege of philanthropy. Further, it was
IKjlr.ted out that if the taxes now being
paid by churches were distributed over
the Siate it would not be felt by tax
payers.
â¢ Kev. W. B. Noble and Dr. H. K. Walk
rr followed Dr. Dinsmore, both maklrg
strong pleas for thÂ«Â» amendment.
Directors for the San Anselmo Theologi

Great "Work Is Being Quietly Done by
the National Republican Cam- .

Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cail,
HIS Broadway, Oct. 13.
One of the big Republican meetings of
the campaign will be held tc-morrow
(Saturday) evening at the" Tabernacle,
when Samuel M. Shortridge. President!*!
Elector on the Republican ticket, will
make an address. This is one of the b!?
meetings under the auspices of the Coun
ty Central Committee, and it will be de
voted to the great, issues of the campaign.
George W, Reed will preside. The Young
Men's Republican League will act as an
escort to Mr. Shortridge.
One of the mo3t important pieces of
work that la being done in the State '.*
that of the National Republican con
gressional Committee, of which congress
man Victor H. Metcalf is the nead in Cali
fornia, from their headquarters at 1004
Broadway. This work Is under the gen
eral direction of Mr. Metcalf. and under
the detailed direction of Fred. M. Camp
bell, the secretary. The work Is largely
educational and cautionary in its charac
ter. Mr. Campbell is in communication
with all parts of California and where he
finds a matter to which he cannot attend,
but which needs the work of some com
mitteeman or candidate in other sections,
it is at once referred to its proper place.
Communications are received daily from
all portions of the State from Repblicans
who want printed matter sent to certain
sections or who want personal attention
given to parties where good can be done
for the Republican/candidates. These are
answered at once. In this way much is
being done for the Republican candidates
for Congress in other sections of Califor
nia Avhere there ia a closer contest than
in Mr. Metcalfs district.
Much of this work is being done by
volunteers who furnish information and
address the proper matter. Among the
volunteers who have been at work are:
Major J. W. Tompkins. Webb N. Pearce.
J. Cal. Ewing. A. L. Hannaford. R. F.
Jackson, Richard B. Ayera. Ed M. Hol
land. D. C. Breed. William HowWt. Dr.

. SYDNEY, N. S. W., Oct. 19.â The Gov
ernment estimates the, area of wheat In
New South Wales at 1,910,939 acres, an in
crease of 69,560 acres. Of this acreage

area of the colony in cultivation is
2,525.498 acres.
Prefer Doing This to Paying License
Imposed for Retaining Them,
but Ask Compensation.
PAGO- PAGO, Samoa, Oct. 19.â As aresult
of an order Issued by the commandant
under the "Arms Ordinance" the native
Governors have sent in full returns from
all arms and ammunitions held by Sa
moans and foreigners in the respective
districts under their charge. There are
over 400 guns of all sorts throughout the
station, most of which are on the island
of Manua.
Most of the natives are turning their
guns into the Government rather than
pay the license for the privilege of pos
sessing the guns. They ask for com
pensation for them.
Governor B. F. Tilley has been on a
trip to the District of Manua and has vis
ited all the towns in that district with
Tuimanua. the native Governor of the
district. Tuimanua is styled by the na
tives King of Manua. This is his old title
and the Government has not interfered
with it in his relationship with his people.
Lord Curzon Estimates That â¢ One-
Quarter of the Population of
India Was Affected.
SIMLA. Oct: 19.â The Viceroy, Lord
Curzon of Keddleston, in a speech before
the Â¦Council to-day said the famine had
effected a quarter of the population of
India and that even now 2,000,000 people
were receiving relief. He expressed the
hope, however, that in a month these
would return to their homes.
His Lordship further said that half a
million deaths were traceable to the fam
ine and that the loss of the crops involved
the loss of fifty million sterling, plus
some millions for loss of cattle. It -would
never be known how many were affected
by the calamity among the hill peoples
and wandering tribes, while the alms dis
tributed were unprecedented. At the end
of August 854 lakhs of rupees had been
expended and the Government further ex
pected to expend 150 lakhs up to March
next. Besides this, 233 lakhs of land taxes
had been advanced to cultivators, many
lakhs of land taxes had been remitted,
three and a half crores had been lent
to the native states and nearly a million
sterling had been contributed by private
charity.
The Viceroy complimented the relief
committees, alluded to many instances of
native chivalry and devotion and to Eng
lish military and civil servants staying at
their posts, and said the common crop
was worth 13,000,000 sterling on the
ground.

Almost an Equal .Di vision Between
Those Favoring Bevision and a
Dismissal of the Whole
Subject.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 19.â The vote of
the presbyteries on the question of the
revision of the confession of faith, as thus
far reported, is as follows:
For revision only, 30; declaratory state
ment. 20; supplemental creed, 10; substi
tute creed, 5; dismissal of the whole sub
ject, 33.
There are 232 presbyteries, including
twenty-one in foreign lands, most of
which will not vote in time for the report
of the committee, and there are eight or
ten presbyteries which have only one
meeting in the year, in the spring.
The report will be made by a committee
to the General Assembly which meets in
this city next May, with recommendations
The votes of two-thirds of the presby
teries will be necessary for the assembly
to eend down any overtures on the sub
ject.
The presbyteries voting for revision de
sire as a rule modification of certain ex
pressions, such as "elect infants dying in
Infancy," which they ask to have changed
so as to read "infants dying in infancy
are included in the election of grace."
The majority of these presbyteries ask
that the revision be along the lines of the
reports submitted by the revision com
mittee of 1S92.
Presbyteries which voted for a declara
tory statement desire to have an explana
tion of the disputed points in the confes
sion as adopted in May. 1879, by the
United Presbyterian Cnurch of Scotland,
which, in connection with the question of
the salvation of infants, has adopted the
following:
"In accepting the standards It Is not re
quired to be held that any who die in in
fancy are lost."
The advocates of a supplemental creed
do not desire to do anything with the
confession, but simply to add to the con
fession a brief statement of Calvinistlc
doctrine in simple language.

Carg-o Shifts and Vessel Is on Beam-
Ends for Greater Portion â¢
of Her Trip to
Honolulu.
* I
, HONOLULU, Oct. 12.â The bark Alden
Besse, Captain C. Potter, arrived here to
day from San Francisco with a general
cargo and eight passengers. The vessel
left San Francisco Sunday, September 23,
and while crossing the bar her decks were
swept by three tremendous seas that
broke in coops and -washed every mov
able article overboard. For the next
forty-eight hours the vessel battled with
a terrible storm and a north-northwest
erly wind.
The foresail and fore gallantaail were
carried away and the main topsail was
split Into ribbons. The cargo shifted and
caused the vessel to list to port so badly
that she was on her beam ends for nearly
all the rest of the trip. Two days did the
bark fight for life, and at last the storm
cleared and she continued to her destina
tion.
When within two days' sail of Honolulu
a strong southerly wind struck the ves
sel and the sea became so rough that the
cargo was shifted a second time, but the
weight was relieved from the port side
and the boat righted herself and came in
with only a six-degree list.

Eighty-Five Mongolians Captured by
a Clever Ruse While Playing
Fantan.
Sergeant McManus and posse beat the
record for Chinatown captures last night.
They arrested eighty-five Chinese in a
Ross-alley club and charged them with
visiting a fantan game. The capture was
accomplished by a clever ruse which sur
prised the. wily heathen, and before they
knew what had happened the entire com
pany in the gaming room were made
prisoners.
About one month ago the Canton Club
opened with splendid festivities at 8 Rosa
alley. It had accommodations for more
gamblers than any other club In the Chi
nese quarter, and since its opening night
it has been a "mint" for its proprietors.
Sergeant McMunus strained his wits
many times, but was never able to de
scend upon anything but a bevy of inno r
cent domino players at the tables.
Last night he effected a capture.
Streams of players passed into the prem
ises while he worked below, tapping the
sower pipe that leads from the club room.
Two of his officers then rapped on the
door and demanded admittance. The
gamblers hurriedly gathered up their par
aphernalia and dumped it into the sewer
pipe. It fell into McManus' clutches and
he screamed with delight.
The eighty-five prisoners, together with
a large sum of money used in the game,
wore taken to the City Hall, where they
were locked up.- They were bailed out
later.

THERE was groM galore on the
mail steamer Alameda yesterday.
The balance of trade between the
Australasian colonies and the
1,'nited States was four millions of
dolJars in favor of this country when
the mail boat was at Sydney. N. S. W.,
and that Fum had to be sent to Uncle
Sam In gold.
In consequence. English sovereigns to
the amount of Â£800,000 were withdrawn
from the Sydney mint, boxed up in re
ceptacles that contained o^JO sovereigns
<>ach and put In the strong room of the
Alameda,
A large amount of the coin was shipped
by the Bank of New South Wales, some
of it came from the Bank of New Zealand,
a considerable amount from the Bank of
Australasia and the Union Bank of Aus
tralia, while the remainder came from
smaller financial institutions. Every cent
of the coin was consigned to local banks
and by them it was turned over to the
mint. . .
There Â¦were many precautions over the
unloading of the Alameda's treasure yes-
terday. Captain Howard, superintendent
of the Oceanic Steamship Company, took
personal charge of the unloading and not
even a newspaper artist was allowed to
approach the strong box. Relays of men
passed out box after box of the coin, and
when the last one was on the wagon and
receipted for Purser Smith heaved a sigh
of relief.
This consignment of gold is one -of the
largest ever brought to America from
Australasia. It will be the last heavy
shipment for months to come, as the
officers of the Alameda say the balance
of trade is now going the other way.

Yesterday he was a witness in Judge
Conlan's court and while mingling with
the crowd he was "touched" for a val
uable diamond which adorned his shirt
front. Belasco did not discover he had
been robbed until he left the courtroom,
and started to walk downstairs. Meeting
Policeman Laws, bailiff of Judge Con
lan's court he told him of his loss.
Laws- was at first skeptical, but as Be
lasco Insisted that his diamond had been
"pinched" Law started an investigation.
Accompanied by Belasco he entered the
courtroom and carefully scanned the faces
of the crowd, but without detecting the
thief. Judge Conlan was then notified of
Hereafter Abe Belasco, the brother of
David Belasco, the well-known play
wright, will not wear his jewelry when he
visits the Police Court.
He says that in the future when he is
called as a witness In the Police Court
he will either leave his jewelry* home or
employ a private detective to protect him
against the reaching propensities of the
members of the light-fingered fraternity.
Belasco is satisfied that the diamond
was stolen from him while he was stand-
Ing in the courtroom waiting to be called
as a witness in the case of four boysÂ»
who were charged with burglary- He re
members having felt the stone just before
he entered the courtroom.
Belasco's loess and becoming virtuously
indignant that such a crime should be
committed in the sacred precincts of the
Hall of Justice he temporarily adjourned
court and sent for two detectives. They
promptly responded and after listening lo
Belasco's story they mingled with the
crowd, but failed to find the thief.

Miss Genevieve Nolan and Ivan Tread
well are engaged to De married. It is a
probationary betrothal as far as Miss No
lan's mamma goes, but the young people
have vowed faith and constancy " and
stand ready to submit to the rigorous
test of time Mrs. Nolan has decided
upon.
No announcement has been made of the
engagement and no wedding day set. If,
however, In two years Miss Nolan and
Mr. Treadwell are still of the same mind
and heart Mrs. Nolan will sa.y, "Bless
you, my children," public announcement
will be made and preparations made for
a brilliant wedding.
At the home of her parents on Golden
Gate avenue last evening Miss Genevieve
admitted, between blushes, i*.at she and
the youngest of the Treadwells had
pledged their troth.
'/We're engaged," she said, "but we are
not yet ready to anntmnc* It. Just at
present mother objects to my getting
married. It Is nothing personal about
Ivan. She fears that, because my broth
er, and his wife are having trouble, I
might not be happy with ray sister-in
law's brother. But because my brother
and Ivan's sister are not congenially
mated that is no reason, I hold, that Ivan
and I should not be happy. "We love each
other, however, and are content to wait.
We can stand the test."
Miss Genevieve Nolan, for whom young
Treadwell will have to serve a two years'
probationary term. Is the second daugh
ter of P. F. Nolan, the well-known shoe
manufacturer and merchant. She Is a
stylish blonde, charming and accom
plished. She is a graduate of the Sacred
Heart Convent and has traveled exten
sively. Ivan Treadwell is the youngest
of the Treadwell heir,? and when he at
tains his majority he will come in to a
fortune of nearly half a million.
Their I,ove Must Stand a Two Years'
Test Before the Future Bride's
Mother Consents to Their
Marriage.
