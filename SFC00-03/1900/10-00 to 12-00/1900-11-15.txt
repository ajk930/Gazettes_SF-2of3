The ceremony of opening the Reichstag
occurred at neon In the Knights Hall of
the Schloss, in the presence of the Em
peror, l . v
At the conclusion of the speech from
the throne Emperor William was warmly
cheered and Count von Bulow. the Im
perial Chancellor; formally declared the
session opened.
It is announced that the German finan
cial bill submitted to the Federal Coun
cil shows that to balance It the sum of
2,240,347,301 marks will be required. The
bill empowers, the Imperial Chancellor to
raise a loan of 97.2S6.384 marks and to is
sue treasury bills to the amount of 173,
000,000 marks to strengthen the ordinary
wcrklng capital of the Imperial treasury.
A bill providing for a third supple
mentary credit on account of the China
expedition will be submitted to- the Reich
stag.
' A memorandum accompanies the bill,
explaining that the uprising in China
was at first such that its suppression
could be left to the Chinese Government,
but It assumed a form menacing to the
whole foreign community. Its object was
then clear, namely, the exclusion of the
whole foreign element by a reign of ter
ror. It added that the Chinese Govern
ment. If not unwilling, was at least in
capable of controlling the movements,
and the powers had to protect their sub-
Jecfs. the military forces of all the
powers participating to an equal degree
in the restoration of order.
To stop international military action
now would bring a fresh sacrifice of time
and the lives of peaceful inhabitants.
Nevertheless, the object of such action
was solely the restoration of tranquillity
in China. Its task did not go beyond the
suppression of open hostilities and all at
tacks on the inner life of, China not es
sentially necessary were being avoided.
The supplementary credit bill asks for
152.750,000 marks, it being assumed /that
China will eventually pay all the costs
incurred by Germany.
The I-Iberal newspapers express dis
satisfaction with the reasons adduced In
the speech from the throne for the Em
peror not obtaining the sanction of the
Reichstag before sending the Chinese ex
pedition. The Kreuze Zeitung, the organ
of the Prussian junker 'squirearchy,
while approving the speech, asserts that
the Right will not be able to support the
Government on every kind of question
during the session.
â¢ Â¦ - Â¦
The speech commenced by announcing
various bills which would be introduced.
"My Minister died at the hands of an
assassin, in a courageous attempt to over
come the riling peril. The foreigners Â±z
the capital saw themselves threatened,
life and limb. These thlng3 of horror
united the civilized community, whers
otherwise there was a divergence. All
nations against which the unparalleled
onslaught was directed drew closer. Their
sons fought with one mind. sh6ulder to
shoulder, even as yonder standards float
side by side. So the governments show
themselves in council, united with the
sole wish to restore an orderly state of
things as speedily as possible and after
the pu.ishment of the chief culprits avert
a recurrence in the future of such a dis
turbance of the peace of the world."
In announcing that the relations of Ger
many with all the powers are good tho
speech recalls his Majesty's sorrow at th^
assassination of Kinir Humbert of Italy,
saying he was "my ally and dear frlenV
who fell a victim to a damnable outrage."
The speech then proceeds:
"I Xrould sooner have consulted the
Reichstag on the measures in China, bui
for the necessity of prompt action anÂ«l
the difficulty of furnishing reliable infor
mation. -WTienever the Reichstag could
form decisions or estimate the expendi
ture the Government felt confident that
the representatives would not refuse their
subsequent sanction to the necessary ex
penditure."
Turning to domestic matters his Maj
esty said that in consequence of the nat
ural growth of the revenue and the In
creased taxation voted last session, abund
ant funds were available In almost eveijr
branch of life in the empire, especially
for measures for the benefit of workers
and for the defense of the country.
Custom's tariffs, he added, would prob
ably be laid before the Bundesrath during
the present session.
BERLIN, Nov. 14.â Tho Reichstag re
assembled to-day. The speech from tha
throne dwelt at length on the events In
China which have excited deep emotion
among civilized people, saying:

The customs service at Manila has
assumed gigantic proportions under Amer
ican administration. For the six months
ending last July its receipts were J7.000.000,
a sum without precedent in the history
of the city. Over this vast bulk of busi
ness General Smith will be given execu
tive control, which means that he will
have one of the most important posts In
tho government of the Philippines.
General Smith has won the confidence of
the administration. To his ability is at
tributed the fact that the Island of Negros
has "been pacified and is now enjoying a
civil government of its own. General
Smith is admitted by the authorities at
Washington to possess marked executive
ability and it is for this reason that he
has been promoted to the distinguished
office at Manila. In June next his com
mission as brigadier general of volun
teers will .expire. He will retain this mill
tary dignity until then, when he will re
turn to purely civil life as the chief exec
utive officer of customs at Manila. He
will probably be succeeded in the civil
government of Negrcs by Colonel Minor.
dent McKinley declared that he would
appoint the Californlan to the position.
ANOTHER San Franciscan has
been honored by President Me-
Kinley. Information has been re
ceived in this city that Brigadier
General James F. Smith has been
appointed Collector of Customs at Manila.
The position is perhaps the most Import
ant civil one in the new possessions of
the United States and it Is particularly
gratifying that a San Franciscan had
been selected to fill it. The official an
nouncement of General Smith's appoint
ment has not yet been made from "Wash
ington and will not be until he has re
ceived notification and has been given op
portunity to accept.
That he will undertake the duties of
this important position there is no ques
tion. Friends who have been in communi
cation with him give assurance that he
will accept. A prominent army ofSeer,
who is now in the city, had the. pleasure
of being consulted recently by President
McKinley in reference to the selection of
the successor of Colonel Spurgeon, who is
now Collector of Customs at Manila, but
who has asked to be relieved because of

The authorities are especially hopeful
that the Ministers will present a list of
high officials so large that me Chinese
Government, which they control, will de
cline to punish any. The President is anx
ious t hiit only such demands including
punishment* and indemnity shall be maue
that can be complied with by the imperial
Government, otherwise there will be a re
newal of the outbreaks on a much larger
and probably mere organized stale. The
Chinese- people are already very indignant
over the military expedition! which Count
von \Valders<.-e is sending into the interior,

against su<_-h attion, but without avail.

Secretary Hay ?aid: "The Government of
the United States is unable to make any
permanent engagement of this character
without authorization of the legislative
branch." and concerning military occupa
tion of two or three points on the road to
Peking he remarked that "the President
Is unable to commit the United States to
permanent participation in such occupa
tion."
Secretary Hay stated regarding the raz
ing of the Taku forts that the President
reserved his opinion pending the receipt of
further information. It is thought that
the administration even now does- not
favor raxing me forts, but agrees to it
only to prevent further delay. Some reason

plan of keeping permanent guards In Chi

Perez and Manuelo Ygleslaa came to Los
Angeles a year: ago and opened an office,
devoted almost exclusively to hermlnology
and the cure of : diseases by means of
herbs, at Seventh and Spring Â¦ streets.
They did an extensive business and ad
vertised largely. While, Perez was away
Yglesias was arrested for practicing med
icine without a license and . fined $100.
When Perez returned he met with similar
punishment; Then the partners had a
falling out over the division of the spoils
and severed their relations. . Manuelo
Yglesias married the daughter of Police"
Detective Talamantes about five weeks
ago. and it was his purpose to remove to
Oakland soon. In furtherance of this plan
Yglesias sent his father-in-law, who had
secured leave of absence, and. ex-Deputy
Constable Mugnemi. his . interpreter,, to
the Athens of the Pacific to prepare him a
dwelling place there. . Â¦;;.
They had been gone for some, time, but
Ygleslas : still tarried here. Mugnemi tel
egraphed two i days ago, that .Talamantes
was on the' way: home to learn the cause
of all the delay. He added a pathetic
postscript. to his dispatch In the following
words: /-:..' ' . ..
"Wire us money, as , we have not " got
enough left to eat on." ". ' . - : ,
At â¢ a late hour to-night the 'physicians'
at the California Hospital said there was
very little: hope of Perez's recovery. As
sistant District -Attorney Johnstone Jones
: and a stenographer - made 'an ? attempt to
obtain an /ante-mbrtemi statement' from
Perez; but his condition ,was_ such. that ho
: clear'explanation,of the shooting and the
causes that led up to It could.be obtained.-
. Two men who had Just corns out of a
"barbers' college" near by. had narrow
escapes from being wounded or killed.
The bullet which plowed- Perez's back
went through the coatsleeve of one â¢ of
them, and the other apprentice barber had
the lapel of his coat punctured.
In his back was put there by Manuelo for
presuming to ask what the trouble was
about. ....
The Ygleslas made a claim this evening
that Perez and Ruiz were intoxicated and
aggressive. On the other hand disinter
ested witnesses were of the opinion that
the Yglesias cousins were the ones who
had been drinking. The dispute which
ensued upon the meeting was all in the
Spanish language and no one seemed to
be able to state to-night what it was
about. Some were of the opinion that
Perez struck Manuelo a blow in response
to a vile epithet and that the latter then
drew his pistol and began firing. Perez
also drew his revolver, but fired only one
shot,- which merely damaged- Manuelo's
coat, whereas the five ; chambers of Man
uelo's gun were discharged before the bat
tle'was ended. -Ruiz claims that the hole
the back, which presented no dangerous
symptoms. His Injury was dressed and
he was allowed to go to his home at 664
San Fernando street. .The condition of
Perez was considered very grave by the
police surgeon, who ordered him sent at
once to the California Hospital.
A cursory examination at the hospital
showed that Perez had been shot through
the left lung once and twice through the
right hand. Ruiz had a flesh wound In
LOS AXGELES, Nov. 14.â Trouble over
money matters, which resulted In a bit
ter feud of several weeks* standing, cul
minated this afternoon in a street shoot
ing affray. The principals were Manuelo
Ygleslas, who was accompanied by his
cousin, Genaro Yglesias, on the one side,
and Benjamin Perez and Antonio Ruiz
on the other. Perez now lies at the Cali
fornia Hospital with a mortal bullet
wound in his left lung, while the Ygleslas
cousins are confined in the City Prison
and will more than likely be compelled to"
answer to a charge of murder. Ruiz was
also a victim of Ygleslas' revolver, but
he received only a superficial flesh wound
in the neck.
The trouble occurred at 5 o'clock In
the afternoon. Perez and Ruiz were walk-
Ing arm in arm north on the west side
of Main street. Just as they reached
the Hoffman Block, opposite Arcadia
street, they were confronted by Manuelo
and Genaro P. Yglesias, who are cousins.
In front of Kaspare Cohn's an altercation
took place which soon became very
heated. The four~men entered the door
way of Cohn's office and almost imme
diately* a pistol shot rang out.. It was
closely followed by flve"6ther8.
Policeman Dltewig,- .who; ,vas i passing
by, ran to the scene, and; placed Manuelo
Ygleslas' under .arrest. : V He was \stlll
holding In his hand the smoking pistol
with which he had done such effective
work, as the bleeding form of Perez,* ly

WASHINGT.ON. Nov. 14.â Rear Admiral
Van Reypen, surgeon general of the navy,
has received a report concerning , the
wounding of Captain Myers, the ranking
marine "officer at Peking./ The wound
proves to have been most novel, heinp
made by a Chinese spear, and is one of
the few wounds from such a weapon that
American surgeons have been called upon
to treat. It also evidences the close quar
ters at which the American cbmmandur
at Peking was engaged with the Chinese
spearmen. The wound has healed to^ome
extent and Captain Myers is convalescent,
although It has been deemed advisable to
remove him to the naval hospital at Yo

their pistols In dangerous proximity to

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 14.â The Ros

the Chinese troubles "threaten to ruin the
RusFian empire." If the \ powers, it is
added, continue their present policy China
will be ur.able to pay a money Indemnity
and. consequently, the powers will de
mand and secure mining, railroad and
commercial concessions, which will result
in the division of China -into spheres of in
fluence and ultimatelv Into the partition
of China, in spite of the assurances of the
powers to the contrary. The Chinese, It
is further asserted, indignant, will emi
grate to Siberia and the "yellow horde"
will again "precipitate itself toward Eu
ropean Russia, which will sink to the po
sition of a second rank power. The other
powers probably will be satisfied with this
eventuality, their Interests being Â¦ solely

here to-day with a good attendance and
will continue for a week or more. The
chief feature of interest to-day was the
annual address of Worthy Master Aaron
Jones of Indiana, who said that in most
of the States the order had enjoyed great
prosperity during the year. In a few
States it has not succeeded eo well. The
members of the Grange, while- affiliating
with each of the political parties in the
last campaign, had emerged lrom ite bat
tles without disturbing the fraternal spirit
actuating the order.
Never had the conditions been more
favorable for the extension of the order
than now. While agricultural conditions
are somewhat improved over what thev
?Â£â¢. a 'ew years ago, they are not what
they should be. said Mr. Jones The
prices of articles farmers buy, he said, are
too high compared with those of what
they^ad to sell, and such remedial action
should be had as would cause an equitable

incident was notable obly from the extraordinary character of the weapons
used and also the additional evidence it furnished, if anything were needed,
to testify to the great reverence "and affection in which her Majesty is held by the'
people. Mere rumor of the attack before the actual facts were known caused' a
tremendous amount of excitement in the city, out of all proportion to the import
ance of the affair itself. " : -
The crazy assailant, having brooded over his lowly birth until he hadimaglned
himself of the imperial" lineage, had applied in Vain at the Imperial household de

in some way. which he succeeded In doing in the most effective way by throwing
his purse and then_ his wooden clogs at the passing procession.

NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The appointment
of a receiver for the firm of W. L. Strong
& Co. has been discussed with great in
terest in mercantile circles here to-day,
in view of the report that the firm's,af
fairs are in much . worse condition than
those who knew the ex-Mayor suspected.
A bank president who had business with
the flrnvis quoted hy the Commercial Ad
vertiser as saying to-day, that it had been
well known In the street that the ex-
Mayor was not by any means so rich as
was generally supposed.
"He was not a millionaire and he was
not very wealthy. Lately he # and Mr.
Stott had been presenting their notes In
sizes- all the way from $25,000 to $100,000,
bo tliatthe leading bank,3 became cautious
arid then many of us refused- to. discount
their stock. The two dead members of
the : firm' had been doing what- we call
'swapping paper*; Mr. Strong Indorsed
Mr. Stott's notes and Mr. Stott indorsed
Mr. Strong's. It was an accommodation
paper and served to show that the firm
was in growing difficulties."
The cause of the Strong failure was
made public to-day by counsel for the
firm In the action for the receivership.
Counsel said that the Strong firm had
Indorsed more than $500,000 In notes for
the Stott Woolen Mills; for which the
firm was agent, and that the odd circum
stances of the death of former Mayor
Strong and of F. H. Stott, heads of the
two concerns, within three days of each
other, had brought about a crisis by dis
solving both firms at a moment when
large sums' were due. The Stott mills are
located in Stottville. N. Y.
One note indorsed for the Stott Company
for $100,000 Is due to-morrow; other notes
nearly :$500,00a are Â¦ nearly â¢ due. The
Stott Company, in which the Strong Com-
pany Is largely interested, counsel said,
had indorsed the notes of the Strong
Company, in return, but for an Insignifi
cant amount, probably for less than $100,
000.- .
"If either Mr. Strong or Mr. Stott had
lived the difficulty might have been set
tled without public embarrassment." said
the representative of -the counsel. "We
cannot say what action will be taken in re
gard to winding up the business of the
Stott Company, but it is the debts of that
concern rather than those of Strong & Co.
that has brought about the present crisis.
The Stott partnership Is dissolved, the
same as that of Strong & Co."

Ji NEVEB TOO LATE
To Try a Good Thing-.
I am fifty-two years old, and for forty*
years of that time I have been a chronic
catarrh sufferer, says Mr. James Gleshlns?
of Allegheny City; with every change of
weather my head and throat would be
stuffed up with catarrhal mucus.
I could not breathe naturally through
the nostrils for months together and much
of the time I suffered from catarrh of the
stomach. Finally my hearing began to
fall and I realized something must bÂ©
done.
I tried inhalers and sprays and salves
which gave me temporary relief, and my
physician advised me to spray or douche
with Peroxide of Hydrogen. But the ca-
tarrh would speedily return In a few days
and I became thoroughly discouraged.
I had always been prejudiced against
patent medicines, but as everything else
had failed I felt Justified In at least mak-
ing a trial. .
Our good old family physician. t>r.
Ramsdell, laughed at me a little, but salt*.
if I was determined to try patent medi-
cines he would advise me to begin with
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because he
knew what they contained and he had"
heard of several remarkable cures result-*
ing from their use. and. furthermore, that
they were perfectly safe, containing no
cocaine or opiates.
The next day I bought a fifty-cent box
at a drug store, ' carried It in my pocket
and four or five times a day I would take
a tablet. In less than a week I felt a
marked Improvement, which continued
until at this time I am entirely tree from
any trace of catarrh.
My head Is clear, my throat free from
Irritation, my hearing Is as good as it
ever was and I feel that I cannot say
enough In praise of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets.
These tablets contain extract of Euca-
lyptus bark, Gualacol, blood root and
other valuable antiseptics combined In
pleasant tablet form, and it Is safe to say
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets arÂ» far su- .
perior In convenience, safety ana effec-
tiveness to the antiquated treatment by
inhalers, sprays and douches. .
They are sold by druggists everywhere

FRESNO, Nov. 14. â A decision of far
reaching importance to the sheep and cat
tle men of California was rendered In the
Federal court here this morning In the
case of the United States against Lee
Blasingame.
Blasingame had been arrested arid
charged with a penal offense for allowing
his sheep to trespass on the lands of the
Government reservation, thereby violating
a regulation of the Secretary of the Inte
rior. The defendant demurred to the com
plaint filed by the United States District
Attorney, on the .ground that no crime
was charged. He contended that while the
department was vested with power to
make regulations concerning the Govern
ment reservation. It had no power to make
any Infraction of those rules 'and regula
tions a crime, this being a power that .was
vested in Congress only, and could not
be delegated.
In the opinion handed down by Judge
Wellborn It Is held that the act "making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses
of the Government for the fiscal year end-
Ing June 30, 1898. and for other purposes."
in so far as it declares to be a crime any
violation of the rules 'and regulations
thereafter to be. made by the Secretary of
the Interior for the protection- of 'forest
reservations is In substance and effect a
delegation by Congress of legislative pow
er to an administrative officerâ the Secre
tary of the Interior. Judge Wellborn
points out that clear statements and per
tinent applications of the doctrine that
legislative power can be exercised only by
that branch of the Government to which
the constitution commits it are found in
cases cited In the opinion.
The decision -will be more I far-reaching
in its effects than is at first glance ap
parent. It practically throws open to the
sheepmen the extensive reservations. It
Is true that they will -still be liable to
harassment by civil suit. and. Indeed, such
an action is pending against Blasingame
in the United States Circuit Court, when
there are many trespassers It is a difficult
matter to prove any particular damage
against ten individual, though these civil
suits act undoubtedly as a deterrent, for
when a sheepman is sued he Is necessarily
put to considerable expense to defend his
case.
United States District Attorney Flint
has nothing to say regarding the decision
further than that It leaves the law In a
very unsatisfactory condition, and In or
der to have it settled definitely he will ap
peal the case to the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals. a

RIVERSIDE. Nov. 14.-Thomas P.
Jones, a blacksmith of Temecula, a town
forty miles south of this city, is under ar
rest, after having narrowly escaped lynch
ing, charged by his own daughter with the
paternity of her new-born babe.
Three months ago, Jones' daughter, who
is 22 years old. was married to D. J. Tripp.
a Temecula butcher. At the time of tnÂ«Â»
marriage, it Is said, the girl confessed all
to him. When the child was born the
husband made known its real paternity
and Mrs. Tripp swore to a complaint
against her father.
Jones, hearing of this action, attempted
to escape Into Mexico * and had a good
start when he was apprehended at Murrl
etta, fourteen miles away, by Deputy Sher
iff Zimmerman. He returned to Teme,cula
pending a-prellminary hearing but when
the citizens of the town heard of It, a
mob soon formed and threats of lynching
were openly made. Fearing that venge
ance might be wreaked upon the pris
oner, the officers quietly secured a buggy

horse probably that was ever fitted with a

land pony, one of a band a Los Angeles

County, where they had been pastured
during the summer. The rough roads had
worn its bare feet and necessitated shoe
ing. The shoes, fashioned out of a steel
bar. when fitted to the pony's feet were a
trifle larger than a sliver dollar piece, and
the full set weighed Just four ounces, an
ounce for each thce.

These resolutions were adopted amid
great cheering to-night at the big ratifica

Roosevelt Club held at this place. The
expressions were none too strong to con
vey the sentiment of the 600 assembled
citizens and the eloquent speakers who
took part In the heart-warming demon

of approval of the people's action all
along the line, and particularly with rela

was introduced amid wild cheering #He
congratulated the people of Pinole on the
fact that by tlÂ»eir vote on November 6
they had made this the banner Republican
precinct of Contra Costa County. He
condemned the reports as false and ma
licious that any one had been coerced to
yote for himself or anybody else. He ex
tended his thanks to his supporters here
and throughout the district, pledging his
constituents that they would have no
cause to regret their loyalty.
Judson Brusie of Sacramento made a
happy speech, after which a collation waa

DENVER. Nov. 14.â With sickening de
tails John Porter, the lÂ»5-year-old colored
boy who ha? been held by the Denver
police on the charge of having murdered
little Louise Frost near Limon. Colo., last
Thursday, confessed his terrible crime
this evening. A day or two more of the
stubborn resistance to the importunities
of the police undoubtedly would have re
sulted in his release and salvation. John
Porter will now be sent to Limon. where
certain death awaits him at the hands of
the grim determined ranchers, who are
assembled at the railroad station and
searching every train that passes on the
way from Denver. That Porter is doomed
to die Is beyond question. The manner
of his death is known only to those who
will act as his executioners. It has been
known for two days that the youthful
but fiendish murderer was weakening, but
it was not until his second subjection to
the police sweatbox to-day that he gave
signs of a complete breakdown.
With creditable foresight Sheriff Free
man of Lincoln County sent an order to
have the bundle of clothes young Porter
shipped to his home in Lawrence seized
and returned to Denver. The suspense of
waiting for the return of the clothes was
Increased by a -wreck which delaved the
expressage. and it was not until noon that
the youth was confronted with a bloody
collection of clothes. It was found that
the trousers worn by Porter were sat
urated with blood from the bottom half
way to the knees, showing conclusively
the fiendish efforts made by the murderer
to stamp out the life of the victim.
The party of officers found Louise
Frost's pocketbook in the closet at Llmon
at midnight. This effectually confirms
Porter's confession.
With an affirmative report to-morrow by
Captain Armstrong, the murderer will be
turned over to the Sheriff of Lincoln
County, who must pass through Union
on his way to the County Jail In Hugo.
Then another tragedy will be enacted.
Nobody pre*>nds that Porter will escape
lynching.
Chief of Detectives Armstrong, Sheriff
Freeman and the father of the murdered
girl, accompanied by newspaper men,
went to Limon to-night to verify the mur
derer's confession and to find the pocket
book taken from the victim and which
the murderer says he threw into the closet
at Llmon station. With the finding of
the pocket book the last scruples of the
Denver police to turning over the negro to
certain death will have been removed.
When asked if little Louise had
screamed or resisted, the murderer re
plied: "Oh. she cried a little."
At the second examination the sullen
demeanor of the murderer gave way to in
difference and with a brazenness almost
incredible he said: "Well, I done lt."-"Llt
tle by little from that on the horrifying
details were dragged from him. In sub
stance Porter stated that he had lain in
wait for the girl and as she drove up to
where he hid. he stepped out and seized
the horse's bridle. He ordered the girl
to get out of the buggy, which she did.
He then led the horse farther up the road
In order, as he stated, not to attract at
tention. Then he seized the girl by the
back of her neck and threatening her
with a knife forced her into the weeds.

LOl.'ISE FROST. THE 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS MURDERED
NEAR LIMON. COLO.. IN A MOST SHOCKING MANNER BY JOHN
PORTER. A NEGRO YOUTH.
Â«Â¦'
The water company contends that It Is
not an insurer against fire. The prosecu
tion holds that under the' terms of its
franchise and the ordinances of the city
the company is bound to maintain at all
times a sufficient pressure of water in the
mains and hydrants for all purposes, in
cluding the extinguishing of fires. City
Attorney J. C. Ruddock and Seawell &
Pemberton represent the city, while Mc-
Garvey & Rlc-d.soe appear for the water
company. The defense has so far stren
uously objected to all the testimony of
fered by the city, but Judge Angellotti of
Marin, who presides, has generally ruled
against it. If the city win the case, a
precedent will have been established in
thin State, and all the other loosers by the
same fire will have cause of action against
the water company, the losses aggregat
ing thousand* of dollars.
On the night of July 16, IS'jO, that being
a Sunday night, a fire broke out in a liv
ery stable in this city, situated in the mid
tile of a block, upon one corner of which
stood the City Hall, Kire Department out
fit and tool house. The tire company re
sponded promptly, and as it was a calm
summer, night the tire uu^hi to nave been
quickly brought under control; but it was
lound that mere was no water in the
hydnints.
The water works system consists of a
pumping plant on the bank of Russian
Kiver, by which the water is raised to a
ieservolr on the mountain side back of
the town, whence it is distributed in
mains and pipes by natural pressure.
The city put in fire hydrants at all con
venient corners, to which hose may be
attached for the extinguishing of tires,
and the. normal pressure is Â¦ sufficient to
throw several streams over the tallest
building in the city. On the night in
question the agent of the water company
had shut off the water at the reservoir to
pi event the use ot water for irrigating
front yards In the night time.
When the fire broke out and the lack of
water was discovered, a man had to be
ssnt nearly n half mile up hill to turn on
the water, causing fatal delay. Nearly
the entire block was destroyed and the
city made a demand upon the officers of
the water company for payment of its
loss, which demand was refused.

tnat the two m< n quarreled and Stiles
killed Alvord. The bones of the dead man
had been scattered over the desert by wild
animals, but the skull was found and
identified by men who knew the desper
ado. There were unmistakable marks
which made the idt ntitication certain.
Mrs. Alvord. who Lives here, has not
heard from her husband since Stiles came
In. and she has applied for a divorce.
Over a year ago the west-bound South

Stiles gave himself up. revealing that Al

planned the CochiSf robbery. He also
showed where the treasure was burled.
He was given the liberty of Tombstone

GREATER NEW YORK, Oct. 11. 15OT-
Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y.:
Gentlemenâ Tn justice to you. I feel It Is my duty to send you an acknowledge-
ment of the receipt of the sample bottle of Swamp-Root you so kindly sent me. I
had been cut of health for the past five years with kidney and bladder trouble. Had
our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve rue for the time being, but
the old complaint would In a short time return again. I stnt for a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world of gcod. Since then I have taken eight
small bottles bought at my drugstore, and T consider myself perfectly cured. It
seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. I do not have to get
up during the n!ght to urinate, as I formerly did three or four times a night, but
now sleep the sleep of peace. My back is all right again, and in every way -I am a
new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-Root. They, like my-
self, cannot say too much in praise of it. It Is a boon to mankind. We recommend It
to all humanity who are suffering from kidney and bladder diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself,
thank you for the blessing you have brought to the human- race in the compounding
of Swamp-Root. We remain, yours very truly

Women as Well as Men Are Made Miserable by
Kidney and Bladder Troubles.
"Tou have no idea how well I feel. 1
am satisfied that I do not need any mere
medicine, as I am in as good health us I
ever was In my life." So says Mrs. Mary
Enselhardt of 2835 Madison street. St.
Louis, Mo., to a reporter of the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat.
"For more than ten years I had suffered
with what the doctcrs termed female
trouble; also heart trouble, with swelling
of the feet and limbs. Last summer I felt
so badly that I thought I had not long- to
live. I consulted doctor after doctor and
took their medicines, but felt no better.
The physicians told me my kidneys were
not affected, but I felt sure that they were
the cavse of my trouble. A friend recom-
mended me to try Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, nnd I must say I derived Immense
benefits almost from the first week. I
continued the medicine, taking it regular-
ly, and I sm now In splendid health. The
pains and aches have all gone. I have rec-
ommended Swamp-Root to all my friends,
and told them what it has done for me.
I will gladly answer any one who desires
l to write me regarding my case. I most
heartily Indorse Swamp-Root from every
standpoint. There Is such a pleasant taste
to Swamp-Root, and it goes right to the
weak spots and drives them out of the j
system."
MRS. MARY ENGELHARDT.
How to Find Out if You
Need Swamp-Root.
It used to be considered that only urin-
ary and bladder troubles were to be traced
to thÂ«Â» kidney*, but now modern science
proves that nearly all diseases have their
beginning In the disorder of these most
Important organs.
The kidneys niter and purify the blood-
that Is their wie-k.
So when your kidneys are weak or our
of order you can understand how quickly
your entire tody Is affected, and how
every ovj?sn seems to fall to rlo its duty.
Tf you are s!ck or "feel badly" b"Kln
taklnsr the famous new discovery. Pr. Kil-
mer's Swarnp-Koot. because as soon as
your kidneys are well thev will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will
convince any one.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys arc re-
sponsible for more sickness and suffering
than any other disease:, and if permitted
to continue fatal results are sure to fol-
low. Kidney trouble irritates the nerves,
makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and
Irritable. Makts you pass water often
during the day and obliges you to get up
many times during the night. Causes
puffy or dark circles under the eyes,
rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of the blad-
der, pain or dull ache in the back, joints
and muscles, makes your head ache and
back ache, causes indigestion, stomach
and "liver trouble: you get a sallow, yel-
low complexion; makes you feel as though
you had heart trouble; you may have
plenty of ambition, but no strength; get
weak .and waste away.
The cure for these troubles Is Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, the world-famous kid-
ney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root you
afford natural help to nature. fÂ«^r
Swamp-Root Is the most perfect healer
and gentle aid to the kidneys tÂ£at Is
known to medical science.
Tf there Is any doubt In your mind as to
your condition, take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place. It in a
glass or bottle and let It stand twenty-
four hours. If on examination It Is mi'ky
or cloudy, if there. Is a brickdust settling,
or If small particles float about In It. your
kidneys are In need of immediate atten-
tion.
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to take ar.d Is
used In the leadlnp hospitals, recommend-
ed by physicians In their private practice
and is taken by doctors themselves who
have kidney ailments, because they recog-
nize in It the greatest and most successful
remedy for kidney, liver and bladder trou-
bles.

Swamp-Root is what you need, you can

fight for the heavyweight pugil
istic championship under the
Marquis of Queensberry rules.
To guarantee their appearance In the ring
the principals have each deposited $2oG0.
The bout will be held next May, the ex

the champion, through his manager,
waiving that point on Sharkey's agree
ment to allow Uie winner to take all the
purse. Bids for the match will be re
ceived by "Al" Smith until January, and
the men will meet before the club offer
ing the largest purge. If the fight takes
place in Nevada it will be to a finish.
According to the terms reached Jeffries
reserves the right to face both "Bob"
Fitzsimmons and "Gus" Ruhlln !n tho
ring before he dons the gloves against
Sharkey. In fact, the champion says that
he Is prepared to go against each of tho
three In rapid succession next 'spring, as
he is confident of his ability to whip
them all.
The match arranged to-day was the re
sult of a sweeping challenge Issued by
Jeffries last Saturday. Nothing official
was heard at the meeting from Fitzsim
mons. Ruhlin was not represented by any
one with authority to act for him. Shar
key was the only one to appear and his
appearance was a surprise. He aid the
talking for himself without the aid of a
manager. Aside from his objection to
fighting for a Bide bet he said he waa
willing to concede anything in order to
get a third chance to meet the champion
and Brady, for Jeffries, immediately ac
cepted the proposition. Brady was unable
to understand why Fitzsimmons Is back
ward now in showing a desire to meet
Jeffries and pointed with a tinge of sar
casm to the offer of "Fitz" to face "Jeff"
at the time the former was In fine con
dition, with only a few days remaining
before the expiration of the Horton law.
Brady is anxious for a meeting with
"Fitz," as he believes the public thinks
the Cornishman is the best opponent for
Jeffries. '
Sharkey remarked that "Fitz" had re
tired from the ring and that "Fitz" had
personally told him so.. Asked as to why
the lanky lighter would not again enter
the ring the sailor pugilist replied that ho
supposed it was because he is getting old.
"He wasn't so old," retorted Brady, "but
that he licked you and Ruhlin within a
few days of each other only a month or
two ago."
Brady decided to give Ruhlin twenty
four hours In which to send on a repre
sentative to talk business with a view to
arranging a match with Jeffries to take
place before the one with Sharkey. Tne
latter said that he is willing to meet Run

Lawrence, Nevada's left guard, had his
head badly hurt about the middle of the
first half and was more or less Irrational
for the rest of the half. Soon after play
began In the second half he had to be
taken out. Nevada was short of sub
stitutes and was compelled to keep bat
tered up players in until the end of the
game: California threw new men In by
squads for the sake of thepractloe- it gave
them. None of her changes were on ac
count of injuries.
Nevada waa able to hold California but
twice on downs, though they got the ball
several times on fumbles. Of the few
times that they tried the line they made
their distance but twice. Bren Smith
made onÂ© pretty plunge through right
tackle on a fake kick.
Pringle, though he has donned a foot
ball suit again, was not In the game and
Johnny More was kept out on account of
a bad knee he got in the Reliance game
Saturday. . . \
Overall showed up well In the fullbacfc
position and put â¢, several half hitches
around it for his very own in the. Thanks
giving game. Decoto played a good
game at quarter. .
Keddie made one try for a field goal
from the thirty-five yard line. He missed
narrowly.
In goal kicking California was also de
ficient. Of six touchdowns but two g'O.ala
were kicked and all of thorn but one were
easy tries. In that one Womble failed to
catch the kick-out and so the try for
a goal was lost.
There were some yellow streaks in
California's playing that are the cause" of
uneasiness In the blue" and gold camp.
Fumbles wore as common as cucumbers.
The great Womble dropped the ball three
times, Smith offended in that- manner
twice and Braley fumbled the pigskin in
two successive plays, and there were
others.
The last touchdown was made by two
runs. Braley caught Keddie's kick-off
of thirty-five yards, and, running between
two lines of Berkeley interference,
brought the ball back past the center of
the lield. Gammon was given the ball on
the first pass and away he went like a
racehorse- around right end with pretty
interference, and when' he stopped he
was directly behind the goal posts with a
forty-eight-yard run to his credit. It
was the sixth and last touchdown.
to their feet was a great end run by Rex
Womble near the end of the first half.
Behind very pretty interference he
skirted the left end for forty-five yards.
Keddie alone was between him and the
goal line and Overall was plunging along
to bowl Keddie over. Womble tried to
shift the ball so that he could give Ked
die a straight arm if necessary. Just
then Moran, Nevada's right end, struck
him in a tackle from behind so hard that
Womble dropped the ball on the five
yard line and Keddie fell on it. A. punt
sent the ball out of danger, but Smith
ran It in twenty-four yards, and on the
third play Duden went over the line for
a touchdown, the third of the game.
p-^Ss-^HE plucky football team of the

experienced players. The game
was entirely one-sidod, more so even than
the score, 32 to 0, Indicates, but thevisltors
fought gamely, and though beaten, they
have no cause to feel disgraced.
The game, played on Berkeley's campus,
'was witnessed by 1500 people. None of
that number were more deeply interested
as spectators than Coach Yost and the
members of the Stanford team, and Berke
ley* men and Stanford men alike, looked
upon the game as Important to the degree
to which It should serve to give a line
upon the relative strength of the two
California varsity teams.

BUmably stronger* than the one that play

a- somewhat stronger team, by a score of

sity of Oregon team Saturday to the tune
of 31 to 0, and the Oregonlans have been
picked as a much stronger team than the
Nevada eleven. According to form, the
cardinal's chances for the Thanksgiving
game still p'eem bright.
The stalwart backs of the California
team found no difficulty in plunging
through the Nevada line or in circling
the ends and the Nevada line was out
played man to man. The Nevada tackles
were boxed play after play and the ends
did not know how to handle the interfer
ence that came it them.
Leadbetter. the Nevada quarterback and
captain, -played a heady game and
tackled all over the field. Keddle saved
the team repeatedly by excellent punts
and Morangot down "the field on punts in
good style and tackled well.
There were sensational runs by Califor
nians scattered through the game and
those, together with more than the usual
amount of punting, made the play excep
tionally open. Â¦

were started at sunrise at a point four

been injured yesterday by reckless riding.
A fox was chased into a wild district

clared off. Another trial of the hounds
will be necessary to determine the winner.

Wong Gtrw*s Effective Method, of
Bringing Prompt Assistance
, When in Trouble. v
"Wong Gow, the Chinese proprietor of a
Clay street restaurant, has discovered a
novel means of calling the police. He ha3
figured out that a fire alarm is about the
quickest way of bringing officers to his
assistance, and he tested the scheme last
night. -It served its purpose, but its use
will not become universal If the heads of
the two departments can prevent it.
Last evening â¢ James Keeney, well
known along Barbary Coast, visited the
Mongolian's restaurant on Clay street,
near Kearny, and proceeded to make
trouble . when he was asked to pay.
The proprietor seized Keeney's hat and
held it for debt. Then Keeney took his
revenge by emptying the contents of two
large milkcans over . the floor. Then the
proprietor proceeded to hunt up a police
man. 'No bluecoats were; in sight, and as
Keeney. was about to dump another can
of white fluid into the street -the owner
resorted to drastic" measures. Ha sound

It was a disastrous day for the form
players. The conditions were favorable
for the sport and a good sized crowd was
In attendance, but the racing was far be
low, the standard, owing chiefly to thÂ© bad
starting. Imp was a starter In 1 the first
race and she was naturally Installed
favorite. A poor start and. a bad ride
settled her chances, however, and at the
end she had to be â¢ content with third
place. Baatile, at 20 to 1, led all the way
and lasted long enough to win by a head
from Trumpet. A. few days ago BastUe
.was far back In a bad maiden race, lls
saba was a hot favorite for the second
race, but after making the early running
stopped badly, and Orient and Annie
Thompson passed her and finished heads
apart as named. Toluca made all the run

GOOD CARD OF SPORT
FOR LOCAL LEASHMEN
MODESTO, Nov. 14.â The sun was
not so ' tyrannical on the plains
to-day, the dust not so choking
and the hares not quite as
Â¦ scarce as they were yesterday,
although all three attributes marked the
second .day's open coursing of the Inter
state Coursing Association on the Modesto
plains. In all thirty-three courses were
decided. . As the card now stands two re
main In. the second round, which leaves
twenty-five to be decided to-morrow, the
third and last day of the meeting.
Judge John Grace. Slipper Charles Gris
wold; Slip Steward R. L." Taylor am'
President Robert Malcolm are all of opin
ion that enough hares will be scared up
to finish according to time schedule what
will 'have been the largest and 'most suc
cessful plains meet ever held In this or
in any other county.
According to the rare Judgment of well
accredited leashmen the stake is as yet
an open one. Six dogs receive their fa
vored opinions â Forget, Rest Assured,
Ploughboy, Sleety Mist. Miss Penman and
Lady Davenport. As but two rounds have
been run the opportunity for stake specu
lation Is large and there la more of this
running rampant on the Modesto plains
than there are hares.
The majority of the courses were of
short durationâ on the average no longer
than those in Union Park in San . Fran
cisco. This was due In many Instances to
the escape of the hare In the dense stuc
ble; In others to the fine work of the
dogs. More of Modesto was present ac
the meeting to-day. About noon several
teams conveying townspeople who wera
not in attendance at the opening Joined
the cavalcade and their occupants" took
an active part in the betting. The biggest
crowd of all three days will line up on
the plains to-morrow and the noolsellers
are expecting a lively time of it.
The betting this morning and afternoon
was brisk, the players of favorites gen
erally cashing their tickets. Anna Held.
C. G. Whallon'B dog, took the flag from
D. E. Wiley's Buckles, a 2 to 1 favorite,

inquiry from New York as to whether
"revenue stamps are required upon an as

CHARLOTTE. N. C, Nov. 14.â Mrs.
Nancy Hollifield, who may be the oldest
woman In the world, is very ill at her
home. She has experienced only a few
days of illness during her long life. Her
sense of hearing, as well as that of sight,
liave not been impaired with her advan
cing years.
Mrs. Hollineld does not know her exact
age, but relates incidents in her life which
took place more than a century ago.
Her mind is still clear. The oldest in
habitants say that Mrs. Hollifield was an
old woman when they first remembered
her and they all agree that she must be
about 117 years old.
"I never married," said Uncle Noah, as
be knocked the ashes out of his pipe. "I
was in love once, but I was too bashful
to press my suit and I lost her."
"Uncle Noah" said that he had smoked
for nearly 120 years and had been fond
of liquor at the same period. He referred
to the recent election, DUt said he had not
voted because he had not been able to. pay
poll tax. He belonged to the Jacksonian
t'cmocracy and had voted that ticket ever
since the organization of the Democratic
party. Being Unable to read he had not
kept posted in late years and had taken
little Interest in political affairs.
He has a remarkably clear intellect and
his mind is retentive. Mr. Raby extended
his hand In cordial greeting. His grip was
firm and testified to the vigor which his
splendid constitution has allowed him to
retain so long.
"Uncle Noah" smokes almost inces
santly. On pleasant days In the summer
months he gropes his way about the door
yard and mingles with the male inmates.
His thin gray, almost snow-white hair
and his bent figure denote his great age,
though his muscles are firm and he ap
lÂ»jars quite active.

NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â Noah Raby, an
lr.mate of the I'oorhouse of Piscataway
Township, near Plainfield, N. J., is 12S
years old. He is said to be the oldest man
in America if not in the world. He has
been for thirty years an inmate of the
New Jersey institution, is contented with
his lot, smokes and drinks whenever he
feels so inclined, dwells with Interest upon
the one affair of heart to which he con
fesses and looks forward to several more
yrars in the land of the living.
YOKOHAMA, Nov. 2 (via Victoria,
B. C, Nov. 14). â The perils accompanying
the use of kodaks by foreigners in Japan
as well as the advantage of belonging to
the Harvard Club of this empire were
amusingly illustrated by a recent incident.
Among the first telegrams received by
Baron Kaneko, the newly appointed Min
ister of Justice, on his accession to offlce
was one from Shimonosekl announcing
â¢that two young men named Burden and
Wlnthrop, belonging to Boston families of
the highest respectability, had been ar
rested while in the act of taking "photo
graphs In the vicinity of the fortifications
there, and asking for instructions as to
what should be done with them. The
Minister of Justice, who as president of
the Harvard Club had only a few even
ings before entertained the Bostonlans at
dinner at the club and could therefore
vouch for their not being foreign spies, at
once wired orders for their immediate re
leaee.
The new Ministry is looked upon with
the greatest Interest and favor by the for
eigners, as it is without doubt far more
favorably disposed toward the latter than
any which has. been in power "for some
years past.
The new regulations of the Home De
partment in regard to the management of
the social evil and famous "Yoshiwaras"
is having such extraordinary and unex
pected effect that it ls confidently pre
dicted that this peculiar feature of Jap
anese life will soon disappear from the
larger cities.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â Two Impor
tant subjects to be discussed by the Irri
gation Convention, at Chicago next week,
and to be urged upon Congress this ses
sion for appropriation, are projects for
the irrigation of the arid lands of the
Milk Kiver Valley in Montana and for fin
ishing a big reservoir plant for the Plma
and Maricopa connections In the Glla re
gion In Arizona. The first project is cal
culated to cost about two million dollar;.
altogether. Already the summits of th<Â»
Rockies adjacent to tho Canadian border
have been surveyed to ascertain the area
tributary to this point of diversion of
water. It ls stated that probably half a
million acres of the arid lands in the
Milk River Valley will be reached if tho
project Is executed.
It is proposed to build a canal beginning
at St. Marys River, carrying the water
into tho north fork and subsequently
the south fork of Milk River and out on,
the plain* to the east. Among other
things it is claimed the building up of an
agricultural country will furnish feed to
winter cattle that now frequently die by
thousands in cold seasons.
The National Irrigation Congress will
likely ask an appropriation of about $250,
000 to b*gln the work. In the Arizona pro
ject ltl ls proposed to build about flfty
miles up the river by the present reserva
tion a reeervoir costing in the neighbor
hood of $1,500,000, which will supply not
only these once prosperous but now dis
tressed Indians, but as well a large area
of public lands calculated to pay the cost
of the entire project.

had placed T 'Blsmarck" under arrest.
Cech and Berger took the prisoner away
from him. They beat him on the face and
threatened to kill him. He tried to get
out of their way, but could not. The men
roughly used him, blacking his eye and
skinning his face. He told them he?was
an officer and warned them to desist.' A
club he tried to use was taken away. He
finally got away a few feet and ordered
them to stop, drawing his revolver. The
command To stop was repeated, and then
he fired one shot into the air to warn,

innocence has since been shown and they

Mr. Strong himself caused the explosion.
He had agreed to sell the property to E.
W. Giddings and William. Lennox. At tho
time of the explosion he had already re
ceived $20,000 as part payment for the
property and a balance of $40,000 was due
in a few days. It ls claimed that he dis
covered the value of the property after he
had sold it and that he expected that after
the workings were destroyed by the ex

the balance due and the property would

Attention Is called to the fact that an
other total eclipse of the sun will occur
May 17, 1901. which will be remarkable on
account of the long duration of the total
ity and of the high altitude of the sun.
An estimate to enable the observatory to
send an expedition to witness this eclipse
will be submitted.
Admiral Bradford sets forth the desira
bility of a naval station at Guam, empha
sizing the importance of the island as a
naval base. He also recounts rapid im
provements in equipment work at the Ca
vite naval station and the completion of a
steel cold storage house at Pago Pago, on
the island of Tutuila, Samoa.- A new float
ing drydock for the naval station at Al
giers, La., is to be completed by May, 1901.
The amount of coal being consumed by
the navy is increasing year by year, and
its cost last year averaged nearly $2 a ton
more than during the fiscal year of 1898.
Admiral Bradford again renews his rec
ommendations for new naval coal depots.
The bureau recommends the Installation
of the Marconi system of wireless telegra
phy on board of several ships of the navy,
provided it can be done at a reasonable
cost. Experiments in this system of sig
naling .have proven successful in the
main in the trials made by ships of the
North Atlantic squadron, although quite
a serious defect has been discovered. In
the event that two vessels using the sys
tem should attempt to signal a single port
or vessel simultaneously the receiving sta
tion or ship is found to be unable to dis
tinguish between the messages sent to it.
The report says that the survey by the
United States steamer Nero for a trans
pacific submarine telegraph cable between
Honolulu and Â¦ the Philippines was most
successfully accomplished and that a sat
isfactory route for an all-American cable
to connect the Pacific Coast with the out
lying colonial possessions of the United
States in the Pacific and with China, and
Japan has been discovered, thoroughly ex
plored, surveyed and mapped. The bu
reau is now ready to lay the cable at any
time.
The attention of the department is called
to the necessity of a survey of the West
ern Pacific Ocean. Many reported "dan
ger spots" appear on the charts whose ab
solute danger is doubtful, thus giving rise
to a great deal of uncalled for solicitude
among navigators.
Two purties were sent to the field by the
Naval Observatory to witness the total
eclipse of the sun on May 28, 1900. The
result, says Admiral Bradford, was, as a
whole, successful, there being, however,
some failures with minor instruments.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â The Census
Bureau recently completed the enumera
tion of the District of Alaska. . The sched
ules have been received at the office and
are now in process ot" tabulation. Tho
Director of the Census to-day gave out
the following statement with reference to
the work In the Territory:
"Samuel C. Dunham, who had charge
of the work in the Northern District, re
turned to "Washington a few days ago and
submitted his final report. He left Wash
ington on this work May 4, 1899.
"The native and mixed population of the
Northern District of Alaska is 12,652. Tho
most populous district with respect to the
native population ls the country lying be
tween the mouth of che Yukon and the
Kuskokwim rivers and extending back
from the coast 100 miles. Maurice John
son, the agent for this district, traveled
over 2000 miles with a dog team during tha
winter and enumerated 3015 persons, all of
whom 'were Indians. The Indians In this
region are probably the most destitute
people on the North American Continent.
Mr. Johnson reports that from December
1 to March 15 he visited seventy-four in
terior villages and during that time saw
but three fires burning In the shacks. The
poor creatures huddle together in their
miserable dwellings during the long win
ter and subsist on frozen fish and a little
seal oil, which they secure on the coast
during the summer. The fur-bearing ani
mals, which formerly furnished them with
natural clothing, are neany extinct and
they have been forced to adopt the white
man's garb, and as their poverty prevents
them from securing enough to cover their
nakedness there is great suffering from
the cold. The spiritual condition of these
natives is no better than their physical,
as the missionaries devote their attention
to the more attractive fields In the gold
regions and along the river, where their
work may be seen.
"The Nome district is the most popu
lous in Northern Alaska. The enumera
tion showed a permanent white popula
tion on June 1 of 2074.. During the summer
about 18.000 people landed'at Nome, about
2500 of those coming from Dawson. About
12,000 have returned to their homes in the
States, leaving about 9000 people In the re
gion contiguous to Nome. It is probable
that the population of the town of Nome
during the winter will be between 4000 and
Indians in District Between Yukon
and Kuskokwim Rivers the Most
. Destitute Persons on
the Continent.

POPULATION OF

Mr. Reynolds said that there was much
typhus fever and also much tuberculosis
in the sweatshops. Garments were often
thrown upon the dirty floors and when
Governor Roosevelt, who investigated the
subject, visited the quarter he found goods
stored in a back room occupied by a man
in the last stages of tuberculosis. The
witness expressed the opinion that four
fifths of the garment work in New York
Is done in the sweatshops. An establish
ment on Fifth avenue was as apt to em
plov these agencies as places elsewhere
and the style of a garment was no guar
antee against the place of manufacture.
Mr. Reynolds also contributed consider
able Information concerning the sweat
shops of the east side. He said that gar
ment making is pursued largely In that
section in private apartments. He attri
buted several recent failures of Jarge es
tablishments to the sweatshop competi
tion. He had investigated an instance of
125 workmen, four of whom were working
regularly twenty hours per day, six
of them eighteen hours and others
less time, ranging down to ten hours
per day. In cases of long hours
the wages were not increased com
mensurately with the time put in by
the workers. In many cases the work
rooms are used as sleeping apartments
and a large percentage of the quarters are
In unsanitary condition. The witness said
the force of inspectors under the. State
law was inadequate and that there had
been complaint against the too-strict en
forcement of the law by the danger of
compelling the removal of the workers to
other States.
James B. Reynolds, head worker of the
university settlement of New York, testi
fied as to the redemption of the slums of
New York City, to which purpose the so
ciety- is devoted. The society's building
in Kldridge street, Mr. Reynolds said, is
largely surrounded by Russian and Polish
Jews and by Roumanians/but he thought
these were being gradually crowded out
by the Italians, as the Germans were
earlier by the Jews and the Irish by the
Germans. He said that the children of
the quarter manifest a disposition to be
come ashamed of their parents and not
all of them were disposed to adopt the
trades of their fathers. . ,

: With that showing the prospect brightens. Any
notable success this year will give the association such
piestige as will strengthen it for the work of the com
ing year. Moreover, a demonstration of ability on
the part of the cured fruit producers to manage their
crops will encourage co-operation in' other lines of
industry- California is so far removed from the great
Centers of population that a serious problem con
fronts her people in the marketing of their, crops.
Consequently every attainment that gives promise of
increasing pqwxr in that direction is gratifying.
The managers of the association, however, are not
the kind of men who stand idle and permit their busi
ness to be played upon by outsiders. Tljjey set to
work devising and carrying out plans to offset the
Â£\il, and the plans are now reported to have been
tuccessful. President Bond is quoted as having given
out the statement on Tuesday: "The California Cured
Fruit Association is practically in control .of all of.
the prunes unsold in this State." Through the pack
ers' company the remnant of prunes outside of the
association has been purchased- The impression that
has Been given out, ami that has prevailed in the
Eastern markets, that the association would have to
lower its prices for prunes on account of the* lower
price-made by outside packers is without any sound
reason for support. The association has possession,
in its various warehouses, of all 'of. the crop unsold,
and no one has the power to lower the price except
the association itself. This wfll not be done, and the
only -change of price, if any, will be to raise prices.''
THE .PRUNE ASSOCIATION.
rROM San Jose come reports that the* California
Cured Fruit Association, after its long strug-t
gle, has at last attained success and is now in
control of the marketable prune crop of the State.
The percentage of growers who joined Jhe association
was not so large as was at .first desired, and accord
ingly some doubts were felt whether much could
be accomplished in the way of steadying the market
this season. In fact, it is said that for some time
past the association has been harassed by the cut-rate
business of the outsiders, and it looked for a t time as
if the work of the year would be seriously handi
capped. â¢ , â¢ â¢Â¦â¢
The peculation warranting, it will be gratifying to
the whole State to give Los Angeles County a repre
sentative of her own. Her rapid growth and commer
cial importance have deserved this, and she will get
it. The same elements will be recognized every
where, End the aspirations of the people, worked out
in their material progress, wiH be encouraged by a
proper recognition. The Republican party is now in
supreme control in California. Its lease of power
may be lengthened by doing perfect justice through
the governmental instrumentalities for which it is re-
This experience is admonitory. The new districts
will fulfill the law, their boundaries will be legal and
natural. California Republicans do not nerd to dis
figure the political geography of the State with sala
manders, elbows, and dogs' hind legs.
Fortunately, too, there is present no temptation to
gerrymander. That is a device that is proved to be a
vain resort for any political party. In 1882 the
Democracy elected all the members of Congress and
took supreme control of the Legislature. At the ses
sion of 1883 it proceeded to gerrymander the Congres
sional district?, and, looking, upon its perfect work,
felicitated itself upon. having deposited the Republi
can vote of the State in the Oakland district, and se
ccred to itself all the rest. / vV.i
Then in 1884 the people voted and only one Demo
crat was elected to Congress! -
CZjORTUXATELY the great Republican majority
I in the California Legislature puts the redistrict
* ing of the State, for members of the House 0!
Representatives and of the State Legislature, entirely
in the hands of the party. Had one House been un
der adverse control the redistrictiog would have been
subject to all sorts, of compromising schemes, in
which personal ambition rather than the public inter
est would have prevailed.

PERSONAL MENTION.
This condition of the treasury will strengthen the ;
demand for a revision of the war revenue act and a
reduction of the tax it imposes. Out of that revision
there will come a scramble of "different interests- -to
have their taxes removed or at least lightened. It will
therefore behoove the people to keep a close watch on
the measure. The law was drawn up hastily to meet
the emergency of war.' and is in many respects" un
fair. It suffices to point out it was so vague in "its
wording that telegraph and express companies have,
managed to escape all taxation 'and to 'impose vthe^
whole burden upon-the public. \ Defects of that" kind-'
should be remedied when the act is revised.. "Morer
over,- the tax on light wine, which falls almost .wholly
upon California, ought to be repealed. " Now* that 'th'*:
Government has an income exceeding its expendi
tures the more vexatious and unjust : of the - taxes
should be promptly ended. â¢ Â» - 'Â¦ â¢
The report goes on to say: "As the receipts of the
treasury were greater than the needs of the Govern
ment, measures were adopted by the Secretary
of the Treasury for the purpose of restoring
the surplus money to the general, circulation,
l^iese measures including prepayment of interest and
an offer to purchase 4 and 5 per -cent bonds up to $25,
000,000, and notice that the $25,364,500 then outstand
ing of the 2 per cent loan of 1891 would be paid on
presentation. Up to November 1 the redemptions
under this notice, were $23,109,500, leaving $2,255,000
outstanding. The bond purchases under the call for
4 and 5 per cents amounted to $19,300,650, with an
additional $2,373,502 for premiums." .
The statements show that the net. ordinary revenues
of the Government for the fiscal year were $567,240,
852, the largest in the history of the country, exceed^
ing those of 1866, the next highest, by $47,291,288.
The increase of $51,280,232 over the preceding year was
contributed from all the general sources, but chiefly
from customs andinternal revenue. The deficiency
of $89,111,560 for 1899 has been converted into a sur
plus of $79,527,060 in 1900. The gross receipts under
warrant, including those on account "of the public
debt, were $1,387,299,262, "and the disbursements
$i.i95i943>47 2 , a large increase-on both sides over the
previous year. V 'O '.
THE NATIONAL FINANCES.
pijROM the summary telegraphed from .Washing
i ton of the annual report oi Treasurer Ellis H.
;* .v \ Roberts the past year has been one of prosper
ity for the nation as well as for individuals. As -the
Treasurer points out, the general activity of' business
is reflected in his office, and his official report is
therefore a prosperity document of the first quality.
Several . members of the Cabinet hold , office at a
considerable . sacrifice \ of private . interests. â¢ Secrer
taries.Gage, Griggs and Root, it is we'll known/ could
make far moremoney out of office than in! it, and
their business affairs suffer while they serve the re
public- Nevertheless, it is to be noted that each of
them has in the. past: shown a patriotic willingness. to
serve without" regard to financial sacrifice. to him
self, and- it "is gratifying. to learn that they may con
tinue,a. service which has' been so beneficial. The
President^. was right in "saying the vote of the country
was an expression of-confidencein 'the administration
as-a whole/ and- the people will be glad'to see it main
tained, unbroken in personal direction- as well as in
policy: " Â¦ --' Â¦ -. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ' : : . Â¦?Â¦ â¢-' .â¢ .' .; '.]~ : \-yy/.
There can be no doubt of the sincerity of the Presi
dent's words. It is not an easy task to form a Cabi
net.- During his term Mr. McKinleyihas had ample
truth' of that. His Cabinet underwent many changes
before the present excellent personnel was attained.
He has had three Secretaries of State, and in addition
there were changes in the offices of Attorney General]
Postmaster General, the Interior and the War De
partment, r Such changes are of course more" or less
prejudicial to effective administration, and, having

PRESIDENT AND CABINET;
RUMORS concerning â¢ probable in * the
-Cabinet have been r set at, rest for a. time at any
... rate by the announcement:*; fro~m.' .Washington
that at a meeting of. the Cabinet on Tuesday, at .which
all the members were, present except Secretary Root,
the President requested' all "of them "to retain .their
places, and their replies disclosed â¢ a "â¢willingness'' to
comply.
-.In. making the request the President is reported to
have said*that if the result of the recent election was
an indorsement of his administration, it was no less
an indorsement of the men who had stood by him in
the Y time of stress and adversity. The credit for suc
cess; he said, lay with the heads of his various depart
ments, and he should shrink from entering; upon an
other, four, years of office unless he could be assured
that he would have with him a majority at least of the
men who form his -present official household. He
said he knew that in asking them to remain with him
there was scarcely one who could do so without some
sacrifice either of money, leisure or personal inclina
tion. At the same time he said he should feel happier
if all of them could gratify his wishes. \V' ;.

In all the wide fellowship of learning-every citizen of the Republic - of -Letters" will
grieve to know that a university which has promised; as much as -Stanford; and | has! so
far redeemed its'piromise so'grandjy; has suddenly.been averted frpmf its purpose, -aiidfap-.

"\ , Every issue that arises Jn ; the industrial andeconomic. life of a people is properly the
â¢subject of scientific analysis. It is known beyond dispute! that this, is not a chance world,
neither in its physical structure, and considered as a mass of matter, nor in the movements
of that humanity which" is the highest expression of creative. force.. When the illuminat
ing-orb of science rose, never, to set, dogmatism vanished like the night. Any such at
tempt as this to recall the shadows and bring night to replace the endless day of scientific
knowledge is of necessity abortive. No authority can bring back^the; immovable; world,
nor back of that the flat world, with its brazen firmament. Nor ; can dogmatism and re
action recall the conception of human society as a lawless body, moving erratically and
subject to varying moods and a fallible will that can, regardless of the fixed scheme
of nature, dictate rÂ» premise and conclusion. The place of the sociologist in the world's
system ( of culture requires that he investigate the laws inherent in the social body and
demonstrate them. On its economic side the. utility of his work is the prevention of
waste of force in an expenditure on lines which uselessly oppose primordial law; ' Given
knowledge of that law, man economizes his force by moving on its lines, and the race
is bettered in all of its material conditions. .
We do.noVsay that it is always agreeable to man to know, his limitations. â¢ The ces
sation of life is by virtue of law that none can repeal, but that knowledge of law/has not
made pleasant the certainty of death". The .knowledge of social law, while bringing
within the vision, apparent to the senses, a less terrifying prospect,, may also be disagree
able to those who feebly:despise limitations. But their fight. against the law is as vain as
would be a denial of the day by one who doses his eyes at the" meridian and says, "It is
AN unpleasant impression is made by the resignation of â¢Professor Ross from the fac
ulty of Stanford University. Under any circumstance^ the resignation of such a mart
from "a great university is a loss. But the special circumstances that appear in this
resignation make it more than a loss. Universities are institutions whTch not only impart 1
learning, but produce it by original investigation. "::â¢[*
Sociology, the special department of learning to which Professor Ross is devoted, is
still in its period of adolescence. It is not a completed scientific structure; composed of all
the ascertainable facts upon the subject. It is a growing -structure, into which much ma-|
terial may be wrought that is to be discarded when original investigation" has massed all
the data attainable. It may be said to be in the same condition as. chemistry at the period
of Lavoisier.
Professor Ross is among the foremost of the world's investigators in' sociology, and
possesses in a high degree the scientificspirit which is as ready to discard . the :~; useless as
to search for the useful among the great and unchangeable facts which it is the obligation
of the scientific man to discover and declare. To outlaw such a man from a university as
punishment for his occasional statement of conclusions reached "within, his- field of investi
gation is to inflict the greatest possible harm upon the institution itself. : \ .'*â¢
Human knowledge was long restrained'by this, policy. . No wise man ; blames the
old Egyptian monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes, , because, fourteen, hundred years ago. his
theory of the universe was incorrect. ;His elaborate system, which declared the world to
be a parallelogram, flat, surrounded by four.seas, and'on their outer edge a wall inclosing
the whole structure, with the firmament cemented to- its top, was" the best that man knew
then of cosmography. But wise men do blame -the later Christian .world for its inhospi
tality to the wider and truer knowledge of Bruno and Galileo, and ;the- Mahometan world
for its persecution of Averroes for the same offense 1 of original investigation. -
When it is known that science in a universityas under bonds':tq /'prejudice.', or. dog
matism, the usefulness. of that university is at an end and its' further existence ;is "without

general belief is sometimes in error that

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1900.
' An Insurance against strikes Is the latest Idea In Austria. A number- of
manufacturers have adopted the plan of paying, a. certain-. percentage upon
their respective payrolls Into a common fund. In the event of a strike- occur
ring In the works of one of them an investigation -/la made by a committee
representing the association, and If It is decided the strike was deda'red'imi
justly the idle factory la Indemnified from the fund. On the other hand. If
the committee finds the cause of the strikers just there Is no 'ndemnlty.
The influence of this organization should be good. Its direct effect will be
to cause workmen to ponder before ordering a strike for.doubtful grievances,
beause they cannot possibly win against an indemnified employer. The
equally potent indirect effect will be to. make ' the -manufacturer cautious
about resisting demands that are Just. The risk will not be merely the ne
cessity for supporting themselves through* the strike,- but of having" the moral
weight of an adverse decision of the committee against them.â Pittsburgh Dis

The Funeral Corteg'e Escorted to the
Grave by Men Who Had
Served "With Him.
REMAINS OF CAPTAIN
1>OUGLASS INTERRED
The funeral of the late Captain William
Y. Douglass was held yesterday morning
from the family residence at 137 Beulah
street. Hundreds of friends thronged the
house. It was an affecting sight to see
the former comrades of the deceased file,
past the bier, turning as they did so their
tear-dlmmed eyes en the oold form ot
their former commander. Every man of
the escort detailed to attend the funeral
had been a member of the captain's com
pany before he retired. Beautiful floral
pieces were sent by. the friends of the
family and of the deceased; they literally
filled the room.
From the house the remains were taken
to St. Agnes Church, where a solemn high
requiem mass was celebrated, with Father
Thomas Curomerford as celebrant. Father

one in death. The priest holds her in con
cealment, announcing her death, and so
contrives that the people's praise of Hero
reaches the ears of Claudio till his anger
Is changed to remorse. When the vil
lainy of Don John is disclosed Claudio
seeks restitution, and Is required to marry
a "copy of the child that's dead," said to
be the dauzhter of Leonato's brother.
When the mask is drawn another Hero
greets the amazed Claudio and the prob
lem of their union is solved by the priest.
Meanwhile Benedick and Beatrice are en
trapped into an acknowledgment of love,
and when Hero is vilely slandered they
unite in her defense. Finally the priest,
who performs the office of mediator in
the play, conducts the marriage rites also
in their behalf. Don John is taken in
flight and punished for his evil deeds. A
good conscience waits upon the faithful
constables.
The Dramatic Movement.
The dramatic action of the play, while
subordinate to the display of character. Is
still of sufficient Importance to warrant
clear statement. Three threads of inter
est constitute the weft of the plot. Don
Pedro, Leonato and the priest form one
group, the motive of whose action is to
promote the match of Claudio and Hero.
This movement begins with the exchange
of love looks by the bashful pair. The
suit is forwarded by Don Pedro and fa
vored by Leonato. Hero is a quiet, pas
sive type of character, of no great intel
lectual depth, simply made to be fond and
to be loved. Claudio is reported to be
brave, but is light and unstable. Pas
sivity and lightness in love provide the
opportunity, of villainy. From an emo
tional unificati6n* their part rapidly de
velops into contradiction and from con
tradiction to reconciliation.
The agent of conflict Is John, tne
brother of Pedro, who is stung to evil
acts by the social ostracism occasioned
by birth, hatred of a brother .better born
and circumstanced and jealousy of
Claudio, who seems to have usurped his
place He has surrounded himself with
other evil companions and together they
plan the separation of the lovers. Bvi
dences are, brought before Claudio that
go to prove the infidelity of Hero.
Claudio is wrought to a fury of shame
and Don Pedro, equally affected. Joins
with him to disgrace the innocent Hero.
At the very altar the woman 13 traduced
and cast off. But already the infamous
plot of John has been' discovered by cer
tain constables, too late to -prevent the
disruption of the pair, but in time to
establish the innocence of Hero. Recon
ciliation is then effected through a - de
vice of the priest to protect the honor of
Hero and td occasion the remorse of
Claudio. â¢ The ethical balance Is re-
Stored by the repentance of Claudioâ
which in Shakespeare represents the ef
fort of the soul to correct its evilâ and by
the punishment of Don John, the source
of disturbance. The interest of this sec
ond group thus pertains to a set of
melancholy rogues crossed by honest
though stupid "Justicers." With these
two movements in linked a third, one that
is. essentially different from the others,
since it proceeds from contradiction to
union and needs to be coaxed instead of
thwarted. Hero and Claudio started
with a common emotion and tended
toward a deeper Intellectual / and moral
experience. Beatrice and Benedick start
on common Intellectual grounds and on
the same moral planeâ they are both keen
of wit and their wit scorns the same ob
jects â and grow toward an emotional con
dition. The intellect Is slow to yieldâ it
must be tricked Into accepting the fact
of love. By the strategy of their com
panions at . first Â¦ Benedick and then
Beatrice are forced unwillingly \tÂ© admit
to themselves their secret love. 1 "Doth
not the appetite alter?" quoth Benedick,
trying to justify his weakness to him
self. And in secret Beatrice responds:
"Love on. I will requite thee. taming my
wild heart to thy loving hand." . Their
secret declarations of love prepare us for
their co-operation In defense. of Hero.
This strange new experience has clarified
their perceptions and Judgments. And
now. In spite of "the odd quirks and rem
nants of wit" broken upon them by their
companions, they are willing to "bind
their loves up in a holy hand." "I'll ten
thee what, prince." said Benedick, denot
ing his surrender, "a college of wlt
crackers cannot flout -me out of ray
humor." Â¦- â¢'*.Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . ,
The Features of Humor.
Three forms of humor mingle In the
play â the comedy of social .manner, the
comedy I of situation and - the , comedy of
character. The first form determines th*
atmosphere of the nlay. Don Pedro and
his companion lords have lust : returned
from Â¦ the wars. In the Interval of t)Â»ace
and relaxation the serious mind Is hold in
abeyance and tests leap Into being. Every
one ;IsÂ« Infectedâ the governor, the lovers,
the \- villains, .the. very- serving \women
coruscate with witticisms. , Beatrice and
Benedick stride fire at every word. Even
the passive Hero phows skill In repartee
UEon occasion. No Â¦ moment is sacred.
Claudlo ts thought by Leonato to Jest at
the very altar;
Friarâ You come hither, my lord, to marry
this lady?
Claudioâ Xo.
Leonatoâ To be married to her: friar, you
come to marry her.
No one seems to be aware of the deeper
issues of life. Life depends upon the su
perficial word, and the word turns to dust
and ashes. For all this ado goes for
nothing. A witty world Is seen destroy
ing Itself. If sometimes tragic to Itself.
It is always comic to an observer. Com
edy makes quick use of such perverslnn*.
In an environment of superficial nothings
traeedy would be misplaced.
This social temper invites the comedy of
situations. Th? play proceeds through a
series of deceits and disclosures. Benedick
and Eeatrice deceive each other.
Claudlo deceives Benedick and re
veals his deception. Hero, deceives
Beatrice 1 and unmasks her secret.
Claudio and Hero in their turn are
tricked by Don John Into divorcement and
trapped by* the priest Into marriage. Then
Efon John is caught by Dogberry, who Is
so stupid that he deceives himself. The
whole play Is built thus upon deception
and falsehood. One character, and one
alone, moves in the play without delu
sions. That one Is Borachio. who sticks
close to the reality of "a thousand
ducats": he alor.e makes ado about some
thing. The very church connives at fraud
and is Itself the most fraudulent. Of
course, one is not. disposed to resent ths*
fact, remembering" that artifice is the llf#
of comedy. Tragedy deals with realities,
comedy only with appearances.
The constables being the only persons
In the play who do not practice disgul?e
Intentionally, but strive to render honest
account of their office, furnish the th!rd
humor â the comedy of character. And
they are comic in three respectsâ In the : r
appearance, thflr conduct and their lan
guage. Blustering Dogberry, puffed out
with ale until he displays a "pretty piece
of fle3h," needs only to be seen to hÂ«
laughed at. He and his mates know well
what belongs to a watchâ to offend no
man. drunkards to be left alone till thev
are sober, thieves to be permitted to steal
out of their company, to let a child cry at
night till it wakens its nurse. Dogberry
knows, too, what belongs to a Justiceâ to
write himself down an ass at every ques
tion. But their chief humor Is one of
speech. They, practice the Â¦whole art of
Malapropism â the comedy of language ran
go no further. We learn from them that
"comparisons are odorous." Through some
stirpld blunder doubtless the watch suc
ceeded in "comprehending two auspicious
persons." These were properly "opln
ioned" and "condemned to everlasting re
demption." -It Is noteworthy that in
Shakespeare the comedy of character 13
conducted generally by the common peo
ple. The time seemed to have little "sus
pect" for such as Dogberry. To-day the
tables are turned: the noble Is more often
the clown and Dogberry the hero. Still
In the deeper things of the play Dogberry
has his recompense. Stupid as he is. he is
the only wise man among the company of
wits. " Leonato, the governor, or Pedro,
the Prince, were not able to discover what
Dogberry brought to light. This. too. be
comes a part of the comic Import of the
play.
Beatrice and Benedick display tn the
first part of the play a humor that 13
more satirical than natural, and springs
from intellect rather than from feeling-
It Is a. humor touched with bitterness,
and is appropriately termed in the pin-.*
'"shrewish." Benedick says of Beatrice:
"She speaks poniards, and every word
stabs." In the war of words Beatrice >s
generally the victor, her superior wit
furnishing indeed the ground of Bene
dick's admiration. They both rail against
each other and are "obstinate heretics" ia
respect of love and marriage. Said Bea
trice: "I had rather hear my dog bark
at a crow than a man swear he loves me."
And Benedick insists that he may some
time pale from anger, sickness or hunger,
but never from love. "If I do. hang m-a
in a bottle like a cat and shoot me." The
secret of their growing love Is. of course,
that at starting they have precisely the
same attitude toward life. What could be
more natural than for two misogam,lsts fa
agree to disagree in amity? They are uni
fied In a common scorn. Upon this plane
âa plane where they exhibit comt>leto
self-masteryâ there Is no evidence of the
comedy of character. But as they sink
from this plane and become bewildered lti
the current of a new emotional experience
they become for a short time genuine
comic characters. Benedick at leastâ a
man Is usually more foolish In love than a
'womanâ made a fool cf by Claudlo and
Don Pedro in the orchard, clearly inakoj
a fool of himself In the first encounter
with Beatrice after his conviction:
Beatrice â Against my will I am sent to bid
you come In to dinner.
Benedickâ Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your
pairs.

The problem of the play Is to unite the
two sets of lovers, but first to provide

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 14.
âThe announcement of Dr. Ross'
enforced resignation of his pro
fessorship in the department of
economics and sociology at Stan
ford University has caused universal
regret among both faculty and students
here. While it is not feared that more re
movals will follow yet the boasted free
dom of speech which hitherto existed' hero
and was considered as a part of wnafall
were wont to call the "Stanford t-pirit"
has received almost a deathblow.
The feeling existing among the oldct
members of the faculty â those who came
i to Stanford at the time Dr. Ross didâ
j and lived with him through me "dark
j days" of the university, is undoubtedly
I very bitter.
I Among the students. the feeling is prob
', ably more open and t words of emphatic
j denunciation are heard 'on every hand.
; To-night Student Body President C. M.
Marrack is being urged to call a mass- i
meeting of the students to take what
action may be deemed expedient to retain
Dr. Rots among them.
j The views of the student body may bo
; presumed to be embodied in the. follow
ing statement issued this evening by C.
, M. Marrack, president of the associatea
Â¦ students:
i "The place Dr. Ross has gained in the
'hearts of Stanford sucents makes his
! resignation upon such grounds doubly ag
j gravating.' We have prided ourselves
! upon our atmosphere of >v tssterri nceQim
; and have felt that Dr. Koss represented
â¢ this spirit of independence more than any
, man on the faculty with the exception of
! j->r. Joraan. ttÂ« nus devoted nis nie to
' the stuay of social prODiems ana when h s
I is caileu.upon to place nimseii sciuarely
' upon one side of a quesLion it.is natural
i mat hÂ« shuuiu qo so mthe true scienuiio
Â¦ spiritâ witnout tear or tavor. It is me
j only way in which a scholar can iuinil
; his duty to the public."
I it is evident tnut the faculty and stu
! dents are together in the stand tor Dr.
Ross.
! Dr. Jordan was seen to-night and re
! quested to ma.Ke a further statement re
: garding Dr. lloss' resignation. ills word
! for the public, ne said, could lmy be a
i brief one. Mingled with love for his
; friend of almost a lifetime was a rever-
I ence for the woman who haa given her
! vast tortune for education, and whom he
i knows does not realize the full result of
! her act. He said he feels that airs.
i Stanford has made a mistake and he has
done all in his power to make her recon
! sider. She is obdurate in her belief luat
I Dr. Ross has been teaching a doctrine
1 that is false and not for the best intcr
! ests of the university. ,&
' How conscientious Mrs. Stanford is lir
her every act that will affect the univer
! sity. onlv those can realize who know her
! best. 1* he fact that she is prompted by
the best of motives only makes President
Jordan's position the more embarrass
ing. In this, the hour of greatest trial
'< for the -university as well as for himself,
i he is calm and reserved, yet thoroughly
grieved that the matter has excited such
widespread publicity. Here is what he
i "If the friends of the university could
but know all the elements in the case
they would not be quick to take sides,
nor to condemn either party. .They
would only feel deep regret that so wise,
able and loyal a teacher could not hold
the confidence of one to whom we all owe
fo much and who is as anxious to be
perfectly Just as any one can be.
"Regarding the story that there is fric
tion between Mrs. Stanford and myself,
there Is absolutely no truth in it."
Even with this statement it is evident
that Dr. Jordan has^not told the whole
story of the trouble. In fact, he says so
himself. Things that have been told him
in confidence, he says, he must keep.
There is the feeling that Mrs. Stanfordâ
1 sensitive and even petulant, though she
may beâ is the mother of the university
and must not be offended.
For the man who has unintentionally
displeased her, Dr. Jordan has nothing
but the highest admiration and respect.
The students have flocked to Dr. Jordan
to see if anything can be done. His only
answer is that it is a matter of Mrs.
Stanford's personal feelings and that
they must bear it for her sake.
In thÂ«* meantime Mrs. Stanford is in
France, gathering an Invaluable collection
of curios for the university museum, as
â¢well as rare volumes for the library.
She knows nothing of the furor which
the removal of Dr. Ross has created.
She only knows of him as Professor Ross
and probably would not know him by
sight. More than likely she does not
realize that the man she has dismissed is
of more than ordinary ability. With all
the above disadvantages Dr. Jordan has
to deal with a question of the most seri
ous importance to the university and act
! as pacificator between all concerned.
Several members of the faculty have ex
' Dressed themselves forcibly In reeard to
Mrs. Stanford's action. Professor How
ard, head of the department of history,
terms dismissal for such a reason as a
cauJ=e for the deepest erlef on the part of
all lovers of intellectual freedom.

the rule laid down for the guidance of the
university. . : .
"It Is a hard and fast rule of the uni
versity that there shall riot be any politi
cal or religious questions discussed by the
faculty," said MÂ». Upaulding. "It Is a
good rule, for if, religious and political
discussions' were allowed/the university
would be involved in endless quarrels and
be the subject for endless . criticism. It
would perhaps ruin the standing of the
university as S.n institution of learning.
. â¢; Professor Rosa is considered one of the
best men of the faculty and we shall re.
gret his loss.- But Professor Ross'is as
well acquainted with the rules as any one
and he should have obeyed; them. He
should not have allowed his socialistic
tendencies to stand In his own way. He
should have been content to confine his
instruction to the members of his classes
at the university. â¢- - ' â¢ '
"The position' of trustee of the univer
sity is Only a nominal position ana I did
not know the exact offense that Professor
Ross had. been guilty of until I read the
papers. Mrs. Stanford attends to nearly
all of the executive work. She is particu
lar about the observance of all the rules
and any violation Is liable to bring down
her condemnation upon the head of the
offender." : "â¢â¢-.Â«. â¢ :
Trustee Leon Sloss- said in relation to
Professor Ross' resignation: "As one of
the trustees 1 cannot say anything, for
the reason that the board of trustees has
nothing whatever to do. with appointment*
or removals. By the provisions of the
trust deed Mrs. Stanford has the exclusive
control of the university, and if the trus
tees should do anything she would have
the right to override anything they did.
"In fact we are simply a board that is
to assume control after the demise of Mrs.
Stanford. Under the circumstances I can
not say anything, nor do 1 care to ex
press an opinion."
Professor H. W. Harkness of the Acad
emy of Sciences, another of the trustees,
said that -he had just returned to -the city â¢
and did. not know, anything of the merits
of the controversy Between Mrs. Stanfoid
and Professor Ross, but was of the be
lief that the expressed opinion of any of
the professors at the university would not
interfere with" their positions In the nÂ»
stltution. - â e â-_.... . ...:Â¦
"Of course you know," he said, "that
the trustees have nothing whatever to do
with the appointment or dismissal or re
moval of any of the faculty. That' Is a
matter that belongs exclusively to Mrs.
Stanford during her lifetime. She, makes
the appointments with the advice of Preb
ldent Jordan.
"So far as there being any trouble be
tween Mrs. Stanford and Professor Jor
dan I believe that Is all bosh."
Trustee Henry L. Dodge deplored the
loss of Professor Ross and said he wished
that some way might be found to reta<n
him. his learning and skill as an educator
making it desirable to. have him in the
university. Mr: Dodge expressed the opin
ion that Professor Ross might have talked
too much and that It might not have been
agreeable- for Mrs. Stanford to have, any
one associated with her in the university
whose views were strongly opposed to
hers. That was a matter of taste. The
trustees, he-sald, had nothing to do with |
the dismissal of a professor or with his !
election. Â¦
As to the general question ' concerning
the dismissal of a professor because h-s
views werfe freely expressed in public Mr.
Dodge said that he had not thought that
matter over and would not, like to talk
about it until he had. , , "Â¦Â¦' .
Trustee Joseph D. Grant satd that he
did not know any of the facts concerning
1 Professor Ross in connection with his de
parture from the Stanford University,
consequently he declined to express any
opinion about the matter. He said that
the trustees really had nothing to do with
the administration of the. university dur
ing the life of Mrs. Stanford.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 14.-Frank Miller,
president of the national bank of D. O.
Mills & Co., one of the trustees of Stan
ford, was asked this evening for an ex
pression of opinion touching the action of
Sirs. Leland Stanford in forcing the resig

had not given the matter any attention
and had not read up on the subject of

SAN JOSE, Nov. 14.â S. F. Leib, a
number of the board of trustees of Stan
ford University, when questioned in re
gard to the resignation of Professor Ross,
said: "1 know nothing of, the details of
the matter and can make no statement.
I merely heard there was some dissatis
faction on the part of Mrs. Stanford in
regard to Professor. Ross, but paid no at
tention to it. as it was a. matter to be
settled between Dr. Jordan, Mrs. Stan
ford and Professor Ross. Dr. Jordan has
complete charge of everything at the uni
versity and If ne dismissed Professor Ross
at any one's request It must have been
at Mrs. Stanford's. The trustees were
not consulted, never Tield a meeting Jn re
gard to it, so far as I know, and the mat
ter was never discussed among them

Marvelous Growth of Y. M. C. A.
One of the most successful and aggres

Men'e Christian Association, which has
had marvelous growth and development
during the past ten or twelve years. The
new buildlnf? of the Institution at the
northeast corner of Mason and EI113
streets is one of the- finest association
building* in the world. The direc
tors have decided to make a spe
cial department of the boys' work
and aa this branch has grown to
such an extent separate departments will
be fitted up for its accommodation. The
night school for men Is largely In advance
of any previous year In numbers and elfi
cie.ncy and the work has a strong hold
upon the community. Next year will be
the Jubilee year, as It will be fifty years
In June next since the first Young Men's
Christian Association was organized la

that every dollar of indebtedness will bs
paid and the building in ban Francisco
dedicated. Three friends have started the

California's petroleum product, the mag
nitude of which is yet to be estimated, is
in great danger of being gobbled up by the
Standard Oil Company. For some time
California producers have been aware of
efforts on the part of the Standard rep
resentatives to acquire control of oil pro
ducing property, but the latest phase in
the situation, and one which Is causing
some little concern, is the statement that
Mr. Rockefeller's people/ will not content
themselves with the acquisition of such
land as they are able to secute from indi
vidual owners-rthey want the Southern
Pacific's vast stretch of petroleum terri
tory, and it is said they have already got
hold of a generous lump of it.
So carefully and dexterously has the
work been going on that the shrewd rail
road officials are forced to adm t that not
once did they surmise that the many little
sales and leases made by the company to
individuals of late were. In fact, transac
tions that would eventually mean Stand
ard Oil control.
The Southern Pacific officials have been
cognizant of the fact that the Standard
Oil Company had turned its ever reaching
hand in this direction, but the possiblllty
that the company would strike out for
everything in sight evidently was never
seriously considered.
"It is a fact." said General Manager
Julius Kruttschnitt last evening, "that we
have been leasing a vast amount of land
to Individuals of late, but there was no
understanding with any of these parties
that the property had been taken in the
interests of outsiders. In most cases the
understanding is that the lersees shd.l
work the land for themselves.
< "Of course, it Ie barely possible that the
acquiring of our land may have been ac
complished in the Interest* of the Stand
ard Oil, but aimltting that Is so, the
Southern Pacific still retains a goodly per
centage of the product, ao it don't seem
to me that the Standard people can have
a monopoly of the product in California,
for a while yet anyway.
"No proposition or overture hag been
made to the Southern Pacific by the
Standard Oil Company In no far an I am
aware. A short time ago we leased two
small pieces of land, one at Bakersfleld
and the other at McKlttrick, the under
standing being that the land was to be
used solely for the accommodation of
some tanks for storage purposes It is
possible that these two transactions may
have been the means of spreading the re
port that we were about to nell our oil
land to the Standard people.
"For some time we have been using pe
troleum as a fuel for our engines In place
of coal. It has given such good satisfac
tion that seventy engines are now using
the oil. and the intention Is to eventually
adopt petroleum altogether for fuel pur
poses. In view of this fact it would be
folly for the Southern Pacific to dispose
of its oil lands, for In my opinion the
Standard Oil Company could not sell it
cheaper than we could produce if our
selves."
It is stated that the activity on the part
of the Standard people is likely to result
in stirring up the Southern Pacific to a
realization that a system is needed for
marketing the product. It will also mean
the exercising of greater care by the com
pany with regard to leasing new pieces of
property. It is safe to say the company
will make sure in future that would-be
purchasers are not agents of the Standard
Oil.
Railroad men say it is hardly likely that
the Southern Pacific would Â¦ attempt to
marketthe product,' since it is 'a railroad
corporation, not an oil producer, and this
argument adds strength to the story that
the Standard Oil has discovered a rich
field here, which It proposes to ' work pro
vided the desired amount of territory can
be secured. Â¦ .

only In a general way.
"While we all . favor the project," Mr.
Rosenthal said, "the position of most of
us will not permit of our acting as a com
mittee to further Its objects, nor even as
members of the museum. In the main we
can render only such general assistance

Rufus P. Jennings offered tne following
resolution, which was unanimously

Resolved, That the changed conditions In the
Pacific within the past few years give unmis
takable evidence that the Pnciflc Ocean is to
be the field of a vast increase of. the com
merce between the nations of the earth. And.
fully believing In the benefits which will ac
crue to all by fostering and spreading knowl
edge of the resources and trade relations of the
countries of the Pacific; be it further
Â¦ Resolved, That the establishment of institu
tions having for their object the distribution
of commercial and Industrial knowledge of for
eign countries should receive the hearty sup
port of mercantile communities and municipal
and State governments; and be it further
Resolved, By the officers and members of the
Pacific Commercial Museum In this meeting as
sembled, that the attention of the foreign Gov
ernments through their Consuls resident in
San Francisco is cordially invited to the es
tablishment of the Pacific Commercial Museum
and to Its objects and alms, which are designed
to be reciprocal, with the expression of the
hope that the friendly relations now existing
between the United States and the foreign
countries so represented may be made closer
by the establishment of this commercial ln-
Ftltution. and by its distribution ot trade in
formation that the Interchange of .the pro
ducts of the respective countries with the
United States may be greatly Increased. *
Razors were flying In the air at the resi
dence of Charles Tull, 207 Natoma street,
about S o'clock last night. Tull. who is
the colored cook on. the collier Progreso,
wielded the razor, and William H. Wal
dorf, who is apparently the star boarder
during Tull's absence, looks as if a thresh
ing machine had passed over his coun
tenance. It took about two hours' steady
work on the part of Drs. Starr and Bos
kowitz at the Receiving Hospital to patch
up his injuries.
Tull was formerly the janitor of the Ma
sonic Temple, but he lost his position some
time ago. He says he gets home about
two nights In every fifteen days, and does
not know where Waldorf rooms in the
meanwhile. Tull was shaving himself last
night and called his 8-year-old pon to get
him a clean towel. The son called his
father a bad name, and the father pro
ceeded to chastise the youngster.
Mrs. Tull cried murder, called for Wal
dorf and tried to save the child. Tull
says that Waldorf grabbed an iron shelf
bracket and belabored him over the head
with it. Tull responded with the razor,
which after the fracas looked like a profile
map of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
Waldorf's face was a sight to see. The
end of his nose was clipped off, his left
ear was hanging on by a small piece of
skin, his lips were cut, his eyes were dam
aged and his hands Â¦were almost sliced
into mincemeat. Waldorf was game, how
ever, and when Policemen Carney and
Morrissey. attracted by Mrs. Tull's cries,
came on the scene Waldorf, bleeding from
almost Qvery pore, coolly stooped down,
picked up the clipped-off frontispiece of
hi? nose, put It in a piece of newspaper
and took it with him to the Receiving
Hospital.
Waldorf wanted it pasted on . somehow,
but TuTl's razor had done its work too
well to permit of its being replaced. Drs.
Starr and Boskowitz wanted to resort'to
skin grafting, but no one except Tull was
of the proper complexion to permit of a
thorough color scheme. Tull refused to
yield up his epidermis for the benefit of
his late adversary.
Tull says Waldorf is a bad man. and
that he does not know what Waldorf was
doing around his house, especially when
he was at home.
Tull has a couple of scalp wounds and
ie rocked up charged with assault to mur
der. The razor with which he carved
Waldorf's face and which Is booked as
evidence against him is as full of holts
and nicks as an overgrown buzz-saw.

Killing of Din Gun, the Last of Three Crimes, in Which
Blackmailing, Robbery and Vicious, Jealous Love Take
Up the Bloody Work of the Highbinder Hatchetman.
A CARNIVAL of crime has opened
in Chinatown. .This time the
squabbling of tongs has not incit
ed the highbinders to murder, but
robbery, blackmail and jealous
love have brought miserable deaths to
weak women and aged men. The latest
tragedy, the slaying of Din Gun, a young
woman, by her lover, Tong Ton, was ono
of the most heartless cases of butchering
that has come to the attention of the
police since the murder of Yick Yon on
Stockton street two years ago.
The unfortunate woman's assassin
wielded his hatchet with all the vicious
ness of Oriental barbarity. His work was
deliberate. After driving the sharp blade
into each temple he hacked at his vic
tim's skull until the gaping wounds be
came countless, and the room where his
dÂ«-ed was done rt-scmbled shambles.
In the early part of the struggle and be
fore the helpless creature's strength failed
her, she sought to protect herself against
the onslaugnt of heavy blows. She raised
her arms ai'd the blade of the weapon cut
long gashes in them. She was left to die,
but tÂ»f lore the murderer departed from tne
scene he raised the bloody head and
placed a pillow under it. Into a pool of
blood he tossed the, hatchet and then made
his escape.
At the beginning of the season the con
tinuation of hignbinder wars* was pre
dicted. Instead, the police soon found
they had to combat with a different ele
ment. Two weeks ago a woman was shot
because she would not pay tribute to a
blackmailer. 'Last Saturaay night an aged
cobbler was found hacked to pieces In the
rear of his shop. A woman had owed him
money and he pressed a settlement. The
debtor's lover sought to obliterate the
debt by resorting to a foul crime.
Karly yesterday morning Din Gun was
killed. She occupied rooms adjoining
those cf her lover. The latter had been
in China for nearly a year and during his
absence had found new affections which
caused him to discard the woman he so
heartlessly killed. There was a long quar
rel in the rooms at 62 Spofford alley before
the crime was committed. Angry voices
were heard by other occupants of the
house. Then came the piercing screams
of the woman, after which Tong Ton was
seen to hurriedly leave the house.
The first persons on the scene were Po
licemen Allen Frary and Al Holmes and
Special Policemen George and James
Downey and Gus Finn. The door of the
room was locked and they were obl'ged to
break it down. When they entered the
woman was unconscious. She died an
hour after she had been removed to the
hospTtal.

Her.
The troubles of the German steamei
Olga did not end when she was towed ofl
the ocean beach early on the morning oi
the 9th inst. She came in with a list tc
starboard and enough water was seeping
in through strained rivet holes to keep tht
pumps going, but nevertheless she wa;
â¢â¢still in the ring" and her cargo of suga
was not damaged to* any great extent.
When the United States District Court
opens to-day A. B. Spreckels. as agent
for the Spreckels Towboat Company, and
the Ship-Owners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company, will, through his attorney
Nathan H. Frank, libel the vessel and
cargo for $175,000 salvage. The owners
of the Olga will have to. put up bonds tc
cover the amount claimed.
This libel suit is one of the largest evei
brought. It Is generally considered â¢ by
seafaring men and those acquainted with
the nature of the beach on which the
vessel was stranded, that the vessel was
very fortunate in being taken off and
therefore the figure is not too large.

"While we lay at anchor that day three
native boys swam out to us. They had
belonged to Matrke's gang and escaped by
a miracle. All of them had been cut and
wounded In the melee, but they got Into
the bush and hid there until we came
along. Â«. .
"One of the boys told nÂ»e the story of
the massacre as follows: .
"'Some of the men^vere down at the
beach and some were asleep. Chief Rew
and one of his men came along and
wanted to trade some native money for
some cloth.*
"In order to understand what follow?,
said Captain Macco, "you must remember
that In the New Hebrides. Solomon
group and New Guinea all the money is. a

"On August 29 last." said Captain Macco
yesterday, "we were heading for Komuli,
one of our stations in the Admiralty
group. As we made port I was surprised
to see three canoes laden with men mak
ing off to the southward. I was Btill more
surprised to find that when we came wltn
ln range a hall of bullets began to , pour
down on us. The natives had secured
guns from somewhere and were firing at
us from the brush. We have a little 4
pounder aboard, and when I got that to
work the natives tsoon scattered.
"As soon as the firing ceased I got a
boat and went aahore. It did not take
long to f how me that the station had been
looted and that H. Matzke, the agent, and
ten of his boys, brought from the Caro
lines, had been killed and eaten. The
pots were still on the fire and simmering
In them were various parts of the human
body. The devils had evidently beeq pre

prised them. The guns with which they
nred at us were stolen from the traders

The firm of Hernsheim & Co. have over
thirty trading stations In the Southern
Seas, and fully half of them are located
on Islands where the natives are all can

Macco and his men ran narrow escapes,
while the vessel bears the marks "of the
troubles she was in. The foresail and
mainsail are riddled with bullets: the rail

Mauser bullet; two bullet holes are In the

however, and we'll give the cannibals an

"At Matty. Island, in the Solomons we
met with a warm reception. We sent a
supercargo and two traders ashore, and
only landed a firing party in time to save
them, from the pot. Wei were met with a
ehower of spears, but when I opened un
on them with my Winchester they were
scared to death. A firearm had never been
heard on Matty Island before, and when
their men began to drop one by one they

Mauser rifles, six Krag-Jorgensons, twelve
Winchesters and six revolvers. Every one

"When I found out how my country
man had been killed and eaten I went
ashore with my little gun and all my men
and we drove the natives to the hills and
set fire to their village. Then I went back
to Kusai and reported to the captain of

were heard by Judge Bahrs yesterday and
the action was submitted for decision.
Mr. Lowey protested against the action
of the court in taking the case under ad
visement until such time as Count Fes
tetics' deposition, setting forth hi* de
fense in detail, arrived from Vienna. E.
8. Plllsbury, counsel for Countess Fes
tetics, swept aside the necessity of a de
position by Count Festetics by admitting
that the Austrian Count would deny ev
erything asserted by Countess Festetics
and corroborating witnesses, and would
reaffirm every allegation made In his an
swer to his wife's divorce complaint. Un
der the statute there . was no alternative
but for the court to take the case under
advisement, , but Judge Bahra stated,
however. If Count Festetics' deposition
arrived In the near -future he would con
sider the same In/his deliberations on the
merits of the plaintiff's case.
Countess Festetics entered the court
room at the opening of the morning ses
elon accompanied by Mr. Plllsbury. Miss

at St Helena; Lieutenant Frank Brooks

tleman friend. She was dressed in a black

Countess Festetics was immediately
called to the stand by- Mr. Pillsbury. She
Immediately addressed the court and be-
Iran to tell the story of her sufferings
aboard the Tolna during her five years
at sea. the details of which have been
heretofore published. Referring to the
many trials and tribulations of her un
haDDV voyage. Countess Festetics said
her real troubles began at Honolulu.
"At Honolulu," she said, "the captain
and crew of the Tolna deserted and after
we had secured a new crew I was com
nelled to take the post of sailing master.
We went from Honolulu to Tahiti, visit
ed all >of the Islands of the South Seas,
and thence we went to Sydney.
From the time we left Sydney I began to
complain' of my sufferings aboard the
Tolna. I was broken in health, my ner
vous -system was a wreck and I felt that
If I did not die I would go crazy. My
nleadings to my husband were met with
cynical smiles and for three more years
I was forced to comply with his wishes.
"During the trip we .visited Kobe and
there found a message Informing me that
my mother was seriously 111. - 1 immediate
lytook a steamer for home, and did not
join my husband again until early in May,
1898 He was then at Hongkong with the
Tolna. Against my .objection, for I was
In poor health, we set sail for Manila. The
crew i was made up of Malays, Filipinos
and Lascars, while the captain was an
Austrian. In addition to my fear of the
crew and the elements, I was forced to
accept a Chinese boy Instead of a maid.
When we reached Manila we found that
Admiral Dewey had destroyed the Spanish
flotilla, and as things were still In a dan
gerous condition he ordered the yacht
away We went, but my husband insisted
on visiting the other important cities of
the Philippine archipelago. Though we
were In constant danger we cruised around
and among the islands, but finally, with
out injury, we made our .way to Sanda
'kan, in Borneo, where we arrived In Aug
ust of 1898. : -'.. Â¦."Â¦Â¦-"' 'Â¦Â¦âÂ¦Â¦ ', â¢â¢
"We cruised .around' and finally arrived
at Singapore." There the physician ordered

me to the mountains for my. health. Count
Festetics would have none of It. He Bald
square. The Count's desire to go to
Africa hastened my conclusion to quit tha
yacht forever. The dangers with which
such a voyage across the Indian Ocean
were fraught were too much for my
nerves, but he laughed at me. Then ha
deserted me and I am here.
"My husband never supported me.
Though we never had any agreement that
I was to support myself, he compelled ma
to do so. If I wanted luxuries I was
forced to buy them for myself. I paid for
my own washing and my own clothing.
He never gave me a garment in his life.
Once, on a Christmas, he became gener
oub and gave me $20. He forced me to pay
my own physician's bills and meet other
expenses of a similar nature, though he
always had money to expend on himself
when he desired. When he hired a car
riage I was forced to pay the bill, for he
said he only got the horses to please me,
and I must pay for my own amusement.
"He went so far in his demand that I
support myself that he wanted to run
separate bills, one for each of us, at va-?
rious places at which we traded. I told
him it would.look foolish to run two bills
as he suggested. He finally consented
that we should run Joint accounts, but In
sisted that I pay my proportion of the ex
penses. Thus I was forced to pay for all
things purchased by me."
Here the Countess presented a Mil to
bear out her assertion. Opposite each
item purchased by her there appeared a
"tick, while items purchased for his use
bore a cross. One bill, which was* read In
evidence and then pocketed by counsel,
reads something like the following:
Cheese, for the Count, 2S cents.
Hat, for the Countess, $16.
Crystallized fruit, for the Countess, H
Mustard, for the Count. $1.
Coffee, for the Count, 60 cents.
Cruet, for the Countess, $12. and eap for
the cruet, $2. .....
"The Items on the bills," continued
Countess Festetics, "were segregated, and
all purchased by me were paid by mÂ«, and
Count Festetica footed his portion or the
bill. Though the cruÂ«t and a sliver nap
kin ring I purchased were for use on the
yacht, I was forced to pay for the same,
just because I fancied them and suggest
ed that they were needed."'
A letter from Count Kestetics to his wife
was 'introduced in evidence. In this mis
sive the Count sent New Year's greetings
to" his wife. Then he bravely asserted
that he was in search of a commission in
the British army for service In the Trans
vaal. He concluded by stating that If he
didn't get killed In the war he would cer
tainly make a fortune after It was over.
Other letters were Introduced, but In ad
dition to the fact that In writing to her
husband . the Countess always addressed
him in endearing terms they contained
nothing of Importance.
On cross-examination and In conclusion
Countess Festetics said her husband's
mother wrote tc her and expressed her
wonder that she had remained on board
the yacht as long as she did. She further
said that her parting with her husband
was not more affectionate than that ac
corded any gentleman -friend, save that
she was forced to kiss him good-by owing
to the presence of the Austrian Consul.
' Countess Festetics thus concluded her
story, and her cousin. Miss Hooper, was
called to the stand. Miss Hooper simply
testified that Â¦ Countess Festetics was In
poor' health when she started on her trip
with her 'husband In the Tolna In 1S93.
Lieutenant Brooks followed Miss Hooper
to the stand. He said he met Countess
Festetics at Honolulu, again at Yokohama
and again at Hongkong. At Hongkong

In her deposition the witness testified that
she visited the vessel. "It was dirty an-i
unkempt," she said, "and in the cabin
there were creepers and cockroaches," but
she and other visitors were too polite to

THB COUNTESS FESTETICS DE
TOLNA AND SOME WITNESSES
IN HER DIVORCE SUIT.
THE preliminary examination o*
Dr. Ralph Addison Huntington
and Dr. J. D. Hill, charged with
the murder of Miss Jennie Mf-
Kown on Saturday. October 27. in
Pr. Huntington'p office, was commences
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday after
noon. The courtroom Â¦was crowded. Dr.
ITuntlnjrton was represented by ex-Judge
Ferral and Dr. Hill by Mr. Floumoy.
District Attorney Byington . personally
conducted the prosecution. The defend
ants had lost the nervousness that char
acterized them on their previous appear
ances in court and seemed quite cool.
The principal Interest was centered In
Mrs. BÂ«Â»lle McCottrey. the sister of the
<?*>ad rirl. When she took the stand she
â¢was visibly agitated and several times she
Ff*>mc-d on the verge of fainting. After
giving her evidence she was so weak that
F he had to be led from the courtroom,
but a mouthful of Ice water revived her.
Ehe showed that her feelrng toward Hunt
ington was very bitter. She declared that
Huntlnpton and her sister had been de
voted lovers for about two years prior to
hrr sister's death.
Dr. T. B. W. Iceland, autopsy surgeon
at the Morgue, was the first witness ex
amined for the prosecution. His testi
mony was entirely devoted to the result
of the autopsy and the duties of a phy
ridan while performing an operation and
administering an anesthetic.
Mr*. McCottrey testified that she lived
fit 2711'-4 Sutter street. The sister, prior
to hf-r death, had lived with her. She
had known Dr. Huntington for about two
>earp and had met Dr. Hill peveral times.
Fhe knew Huntington intimately and he
was a lover of her sister. He used o
call at the house very frequently, some-
Huntington and Hill called at her house
Saturday evening, October 27. They both
seemed excited and nervous. She asked
Huntington if Jennie was sick. He shook
his head and said "No." She then asked,
"Is she dead?" and he said, "Yes." She
asked how did she die and he told her
he had been treating her for an illness
and he had told her the Monday previous
that she would have to undergo an oper
ation. Jennie objected at first, but finally
consented and on Friday evening he took
her to dinner and they went to Dr. H'll
and arranged for the operation to take
place the next day. Jennie had asked him.
not to tell Mrs. McCottrey and as a phy
sician he could not break confidence with
her. The witness told him that he had nu
right to do euch a thing as he knew shÂ«
was an experienced nurse and should
have been consulted. He knew how she
loved Jennie and Dr. Hill remarked. "You
could not have loved her more than Dr.
Hui;tlngrton." She asked Huntington if
there had been anything -wrong and he
said, "No; Jennie was as 'jua a ?irl as
ever lived." For the sake of what the
public might say she suggested that It
should be given out that she was present
at the operation and Jennie suo
cumbed to the chloroform. They con
tented. They ?ald they had worked for
three hours over her. Mr. Davis was pres
t ent at the interx-iew.
Jennie came home with a chill Wednes
day evening and she put her to bed. Dr.
Huntington telephoned and seemed dis
tressed when told that Jennie had a chill.
He asked if he could call and when ehÂ«
told Jennie she said he could come if he
liked. He did not come that night, but
called to pee Jennie Thursday evening.
Friday evening he took her to dinner.
Saturday morning Jennie appeared sick
times two or three times a day. He and
her sister had been going together lor two
years and they were devoted lovers. No
one else went out with her sister or paid
her any attention.
Hill was put through a severe cross-ex
amination by the District Attorney, chieflv
as to his experience since he graduated In
July last, the questions being prompted by
Dr. Leland, and more than once the Judge
Interposed. As there are witnesses to be
called to testify on behalf of Dr. Hill the
examination was continued until this
morning at 11 o'clock. Dr. Huntington
will probably reserve his defense until the
case Is heard In the Superior Court.
This cloeed the case for the prosecution
and Dr. Hill was called to the stand. He
testified that he had not seen Jennie on
the Thursday or Friday before the opera
tion. Dr. Huntington came to his office
Friday evening and asked If he would ad
minister an anesthetic for him next day
at 2 o'clock. Hill suggested 1 o'clock and
It was so arranged. Hill was at Dr. Hunt
lngton's office at 1 o'clock Saturday and
In about fifteen minutes the young lady
came in. He carefully examined her heart
and respiration and found both in good
condition. She seemed a little nervous.
He asked her no questions. He adminis
tered the chloroform for a few minutes
and then told Dr. Huntington that he was
ready. In about three-quarters of an hour
he noticed signs of syncope, which were
observed at the same time by Dr. Hunt
ington, who remarked, "She Is sinking."
He immediately began artificial respira
tion and they worked on her for nearly
three hours. They then called upon Mrs.
McCottrey and witness told her that Dr.
Huntington had something: to pay to her.
Huntington took Mrs. McCottrey in his
arms and witness left the room. He di.1
not recollect anything being then said by
Mrs. McCottrey as to suggesting that she
was there, but- next evening Mrs. McCot
trey and Dr. Huntington called at his of
fice and she made the suggestion. He aH
vlsed her not to do so.
Miss Kate Degnan, 1135 Folsom street,
testified to having known the dead glri
very well. She had often seen her and
Dr. Huntington together. He always
seemed very attentive and devoted to her.
On cross-examination the witness admit
ted that Jennie was always a delicate,
sickly girl. She was 21 years of age. ShÂ«
had been suffering for four or five months
and Dr. Huntington had been treating her
oft and on. Mr. Davis did not pay Jennie
any attention. She asked him often to
take Jennie for a drive or to dinner and
had also told him to write to her when
ehe was In the country. Both she and
Jennie looked upon Mr. Davis as a father.
Jennie never went to see Mr. Davis at the
college except with her permission.

headache and felt as If she were going t

the night. The Oceania went down to the
st-a and behind her the darkness close'd
round the little yacht Tolna at anchor in

launch her action for divorce against her
titled and characteristically negligent

Divorce Action, Supported by a Sensational Chapter of
Abuses She Suffered at the Hands of the Austrian
Nobleman, Is Submitted for Decision by Judge Bahrs.
Health Board's Investigation of Com
missary's Suspension by Suss
dorff Develops Niggardly
Policy.
' Â¦ â Â» Â¦ Â¦ .
The features of last night's investiga
tion into the milk-watering scandal at the
City and County Hospital were the tes
timony of Commissary Magulre that Su
perintendent Sussdbrff told . him to cease
testing and rejecting milk and delegate
that duty to Peter Teyssier, a kitchen em
ploye, and that the cream was skimmed
off many of the cans of milk daily and
six pints of it sent to the superintendent's
table; the acknowledgment by Daniel
Richards, one of the "affidavit makers,"
that Mtigulre had never given him in
structions to water the milk, and the
statement by Dr. Bazet that he himself
had charge of one of the wards in which
it is alleged the diluted milk was served. .
The investigation was resumed with thÂ«
same "dramatis personae" that took part
at Tuesday's session. It developed that suf
ficient milk was not provided for the re
quirements of patients and employes and -It
was watered so that it would go around.
It would appear that this was a matter of
common knowledge among the officials
and subordinates, but no one- thought It
incumbent upon him to report the matter
to the Health Board until Dr. d'Ancona,
chairman of the Hospital Committee of
the Board of Supervisors, had awakened
sufficiently to take a slight look into mat
ters at the big institution.
Miss Patton, superintendent of nurses of
the hospital, testified that it was pos
sible for any the nurses to dilute the milk
In the pantries, which were not kept
locked. The diet nurse, who was in
charge, was called away at various times,
leaving the milk and other food unpro
tected. There had been frequent com
plaints, previous to Maguire b appoint
ment as commissary, that the milk was
bad. Prior to the present investigation
Miss Patton was satisfied that the pa
tients were receiving more milk, but 8he
could not judge of its quality. She had
heard no word of complaint about the
milk since Maguire had been commissary.
There was nothing to prevent con
valescents or attendants from entering
the pantries and abstracting milk and
substituting water. She could not tell
who had put water into the milk from,
which samples were taken and pro
nounced below the standard by Chemist
Green. Miss Patton had a hazy remem
brance of once being informed that some
one had turned the nose into a milk can,
but whether to clean the can or dilute the
milk she did not remember. Louis Lioo,
the head cook, had once told her that li
was customary to mix three cans of wa
ter with five cans of the lacteal fluid,
but he told her that before Maguire's
regime.
Daniel Richards, a former patient, but
now a servant In the institution, had been
entry clerk for several months under
Commissary Maguire. Richards attributes
his dismissal from the post of entry clerk
to a complaint made by Magulre to Suss
dorff. Richards had told Maguire that the
milk was poor and was called "blue milk"
by the attaches. Magulre had never given
him direct orders to water the milk, but
had instructed him to reduce the quan
tity of the milk to be supplied to em
ployes. Richards said he had signed the
statement that he was willing to swear
that Magulre had given him orders to
water the milk at the request of Dr. Suss
dorff and Dr. Buckley. Richards had
heard complaints from â¢ nurses, patients
and especially from employes about the
poor milk. It was possible to have adul
terated the milk in the wards after it
left the commissary's department.
On cross-examination Richards said he
did not know if Maguire had complained
of his being drunk to Superintendent
Sv-.ssdorfr, but Magulre had lectured him
(Richards) for drinking too much. Rich
ards had seen Peter Teyssier manipulate
the milk, but some of the complaints made
by patients were made without ' Just
ground. He had heard Maguire say that
the milk for employes and officials ehottld
be adulterated, so as to reduce expenses.
Resident Physician Maher had never
heard any complaints from patients about
their food, nor had he ever heard Magulre
give orders to water the milk. ,
Dr. Bazet here broke In and said that
the reason why, patients did not complain
about their food was because -they were
afraid to do bo.
"If they . complain," said Dr. B,azet,
"their lives are made unbearable, so they
prefer to keep their mouths shut, even If
the food Is bad. In the ward over which
I have control I endeavor to have the pa
tients freely tell -whether the food is sat
isfactory or not."
Maher explained the erasure of the
word "patients" In Teyssler's affidavit
that Maguire had ordered him to water
the milk, that Tevssler stated Magulre
had always told him to give patients
pure milk. Maher testified that Richards
was an "alcoholic," but Dr. Buckley ob
jected to the testimony on the ground
that the information was gained profes
pipnally. Maher. however, had seen Rich
ards under the influence of liquor In thÂ©
last six months -when he was not his pa
tient He considered Richards mentally
incompetent as a result of drink. Dr.
Bazet said it was the habit of the ward
tenders as soon as they received their
wages of $5 to disappear, presumably to
go on a spree.
Commissary Magulre was put on the
stand and entered a general denial of the
charge that he had watered the -milk.
"When Maffulre took charge he lenrned
from his predecessor'that the last Board
of Health had ordered him to reduce the
number of cans .of milk served to the.
patients and employes from thirty to
twenty-five cam.
"On taking charge of the office." said
MapuJre "T set about to determine how
to live within the limited amount of
money allowed the commissary's depart
ment. By rneans of a lactometer I ascer
tained that some of the milk was below
standard, which I rejected, ordering new
milk In Its stead. This continued for sev
eral weeks and on the advice of Dr. Suss
dorff T delegated that fluty to Peter Teys
sier and instructed him how to use the
lactometer and. to report all shortages.
After the patients had been supplied, the
remaining cans were skimmed. Six Dints
were sent to the maternity ward and six
pints to the superintendent's table. I
noticed that Teyssier then poured water
Into the cans to make up what was taken
out. I cut down the supply of the em
ployes' milk from ten cans to what I
thought was proper. The head waiter was
in the habit of skimming the milk for
favored nurse's and employes, and I put
an end to that practice. From this dates
the commencement of my troubles.
"T learned then that there was a strong:
combination aralnst me among the em T
ployes because of my methods of econ
omy Teyssler said he was called a 'scab*
and" I a miser because T reduced the al
lowance of milk to employes. I never
issued an order to water themilk. T never
watered it mrÂ«elf . nor do I believe that
any of the ml'k senfto the patients was
diluted In my department."
At this point the Investigation was post
poned until 4 o'clock this afternoon.

NEW TORK, Nov. < 14.â There .was less ac

was a decline ', of 3^7 points under adverse

movement. The market here promptly ' rallied
and ' advanced â¢ 60?9 i>olnts . from , the - low level
of the opening. In the afternoon the local con

spinners would not pay present prices for cot

was sufficiently heavy at least for the time

NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â The striking fact
about to-day's stock market was the decreased
volume of trading. Yesterday's reaction was
checked and quite an imposing show of
strength was made afterward, but there wag
so ' renewal of the inordinate buying demand
which carried pric** up with a rush all through
last week. The market. In fact, dropped back
Into u aSalr of ordinary Importance, business
continuing on a large scale, compared with the
normal, .but, the movement of prices obviously
depending on artificial stlmula'nts. Yesterday's
decline Induced some selling' orders from out
side sources this morning, but the powerful
support by the bull pools, who are etill operat
ing for an advance checked the decline and
secured control of the market almost Immedi
ately. There waa some small buying for Lon
don account, but it was not a potent factor In
the market. It is probable also that there was
eome buying from speculative Interests which
have b**n watching for a reaction ever since
the election. The buying fell off as prices rose
Â«.bove yesterday's level. The most effective
movements of the day were In Pennsylvania
endâ Northern Pacific, There were vague
rumors afloat of further deals by the Pennsyl
vania Company of the same character as the
series of acquirements* of stock In other com
panies earHer in the year. The accompanying
etrength of Baltimore and Ohio. Norfolk anl
Wettern and some of the coalers was Intended
to give color to these rumors, but no authori
tative' confirmation *u forthcoming and the
stock of Pennsylvania was highly manipulated
all day. The buying of Northern Pacific, both
Â«temon and preferred, seemed Of a more sub
stantial character. The statement of the con
Â£ftion of the company, issued by the trustees,
in fiipBolvJng the voting trust and the desira
bility of additional holding!* for centralized
control following the dissolution of the trust
offered plausible motives for the buying. The
movement In .the local tractions and In Gen
eral Electric grew out of the statement in the
annual repcrt of the Manhattan Elevated Com
pany, as to the proirnfw being made toward
radical equipment and the friendly co-operation
of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company.
TbÂ» advances extended all the way from 1% In
Pennsylvania to 7Â«* in General Electric. These
stocks about measure the dimensions of the
upward movement, gains elsewhere being for
the most part in sympathy. Consequently,
when heavy realising developed In Northern
Pacific ar.d Pennsylvania, which practically
wiped out their earlier gains, and in Manhat
tan the whole market fell weak again and fell
back to an average level about as low as that
of the morning. There was a final rally, but
lt was lacking In map and was not well main
tained, the market dosing Irregular. Pacific
Mall. Linseed Oil preferred and one or two
of the steel stocks were actively reactionary.
Call money got up to â¬ p*r cent arain aad the
time money market continued firm and rather
active. Apprehenticns of a money squeeze axe
an Influence In the more cautious altitude of
the speculation, but the fact that 'the public
Omend for stocks has evidently been sated
for the time being. Is the preponderant fact of
thÂ« (peculation.

j CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â The heavy wheat llqul
i dation of yesterday was continued to-day with
| few Interruptions. The market opened with a
! show of steadiness, December V*Â©H to a shade
higher, at 73'i(g73c, on covering by ehorts. who
were influenced by tha comparatively slight de
cline at Liverpool In the face of l'.-bltflHc slump
here yesterday. The market held for only a
moment, however, as there was plenty of long
wheat waiting to be dumped Into the pit.
Bearish feeling was encouraged by a further
decline at Liverpool, a slump at Antwerp
equal to lUc and Minneapolis reports claiming
two-thirds of the flour mills there had been
closed. Late the aniall clearances, 101,000 bush
els In wheat and flour at the seaboard, caused
further alarm among holders. December
slumped from the opening to 72V4C, where the
market steadied on profit-taking by shorts and
rallied to 72%c. This support on the. reaction
ceased and the market again dragged. . Decem
ber dropped to 724c, closed weak. He under
yesterday at 724Â©72Â»jc.
Corn exhibited a moderate degree of activity
and entire independence oi the wheat weakness,
save at the outset of trading. Business was
small In volume and the strength was due to
a scarcity of offerings. December .closed 4c
higher.
Oats were dull and bare of feature, but steady
with corn. December closed a shade lower.
Provisions were easier earlier on the unex
pectedly heavy receipts of. hogs and lower
prices at the yards. Receipts were 11,000 more
than had been estimated. . Later early sellers
joined by packing interests caused a good rally.
Their buying was Influenced largely, by cash
demand. January pork closed 2Hc higher; lard
6c' higher up and ribs 24@<>c up.
The leading futures ranged # as follows:

Weather Report.
"The Improvement In trade noted 'CTedae*
tay oontlouea, and. In eplte of the lack of
real cold, enappy weather, the regular holi
day buying is getting under way In qultt
good rt}~lÂ«. More out-of-town grocery men
were about yesterday than for some time
and mall business Is also of good proportion*.
There is a fair demand from the consuming
trade for nearly the full line of dried fruit
and nuts. The raisin situation Is not very en
couraging. Seeded are going out wtll. but
loose are in a bad way, as a. result of cutting
by holders of outside goods. Two-crown loo*Â»
are scare* and steady, but 3-crown and 4-crown
are weak and unsettled. Currants are In quite
rood demand at quotations. Prunes are un
ch&nfred, with on!w a moderate demand from
Jobbers.- Evaporated apples are firm and quite
active on the spot. Increasing Interest Is taken
In nut*."

The board of trustees of the Mechanics'
Institute decided to extend the member
ship of the institute library out into the
country and make arrangements whereby
clubs may be formed In the interior towns
fÂ£ r purpo 2Â£ of obtaining books from
the library. The arrangement Is that a
group of ten or more persons may Join
the Institute., paying the same dues as
Â»Â£ members and once each month a box
of books will be sent to some one person
charged with their distribution. This
same party will attend also to returning
the books once each month. The charge
for freight on the books will be borne by
the country members, but this will be so
slight that It will be an enormous advant

had to pay postage both ways on all bookb

Captain's Victim During 1 the
Murder Trial.
STOCKTON, Nov. 14,-The Jury which is
to try Captain A. F. Williams for tha kill-
Ing of ' Conductor William Martin was
sworn in Judge Jones' court to-day, and
the taking of testimony began: Williams
betrayed an interest in the proceedings,
but no excitement. His. wife, however!
was intensely nervous. Mrs. Estelle Wil
liams, the divorced wife of the accused
sat with Mrs.' Martin, the widow of Wil
liams' victim, until both were excluded
under the rule governing witnesses. Mrs
Williams the first signalized her entrance
Into court yesterday by kissing Mrs. Mar
tin. She was with Martin at the baths the
evening he was killed and has caused her
former husband all the trouble she could
since their divorce. Her movements in
this case are anything but : indicative of
'sympathy for him; ; " -
The defendant's present wife, his mother
an'd his sister had places beside him to
day and, not being witnesses, were allowed
to remain. The :f act that Judge Budd ad
mitted Williams to. bail Is regarded as a
point vin his- favor, as fixing thedegree
of murder,- If any, of which he may be
guilty, but it looks as though the District
Attorney Intends to press.- the Â¦â¢ case - for
capital punishment. In his address to-dav
District Attorney Ashley said; he would
attempt to prove that the killing was will
ful and deliberate.. ;; - ' ..Â¦; Â¦ .-..:.-.Â¦
.Williams' defense Is -based on the claim
that, Martin on entering, the: barroom ad
vanced toward : him , and ; attempted to
strike him, when. In self-defense, he drew
his revolver^ and. fired. Dr. .Sargent was
the only .witness called to-day.^

"Work has been started on some import
ant improvements to the Southern Pa
cific's central division between Ogden and
Sacramentc. The construction depart
ment has about 200 men and 400 horses at
work grading â and relaying portions of
track in Utah and* Nevada. Curves are
being shortened and grades that have
heretofore prevented locomotives from
making good time are being reduced
wherever practicable. It is expected that
the improvements will shorten the time
schedule between here and Chicago very
materially.
The changes have long been under con
templation and. .the announcement that
they are to be pushed along without fur
ther delay will prove of no small interest
to patrons of this road as well as railroad
men generally. Chief Engineer Hood said
yesterday that It was impossible to tell
when the work would be finished, as the
department Is acting under orders from
the New York office. Later, If It is thought
best to speed the work, the present force
will probably be doubled.

Another letter from French to his sweet
heart reads as follows: "
Seymour and his men while searching
for the mysterious box which was shipped
here from Chico by French and Tessf er
and was consigned to a man named Wolf,
ascertained that Seigieman was the per
son who received the plunder. . Yesterday
he was located at his home at Twenty
second and Minnesota streets and placed
under arrest. Seigieman at first denied
that he had received the box which is sup
posed to have contained the plunder of
the- desperate pair, but finally he admitted
that it had been sent to his house by a
friend. After conFiderable questioning he
caid he was acquainted with Tessler, but
he Etrenuously denied that he had assisted
him and French in blowing up safes. He
also declared that he had never been In
trouble, even to denying that he had been
en inmate of San Quentln. When con
fronted with his picture in the Rogue's
<;.i;,i-ry he broke down and admitted that
he had served a term in San Quentln.
Seigieman, so the police claim, is the
man who shipped the tools used in open
ing safes, to French and Tessler. The
tools, which are considered by the police
the most complete kit that has come
under their notice for some time, were
foiÂ«nd on the F.afecrackers when arrested
by the Marshal of Chico. It is positively
known that French and Tessier shipped
a box containing Jewelry and other stolen
articles to Seigieman. and after receiving
thÂ» box he took it to his home where he
broke it open and subsequently disposed
of the plunder. Seigieman will be taken
to Chico to-Â«iay where he will be tried
jointly with the safecrackers.
Yesterday the police gave out a letter
which was written by Seigieman to Tes
eier. It was found on Testier when he
wa.s arrested. Seigieman wrote him that
he had received the box and that every
thing was all right. He warned him to
be careful as he was likely to serve an
other term- in the penitentiary. French,
who Is considered one of the most ex
pert eafecrackers in the country, was in
lore, as shown by the following which was
found on his possession.
Through the efforts of Captain of De
tÂ«?ctives Seymour, the go-between for
French and Tessier, the eafecxackers who
are tinder arrest at Chico, is safely locked
up In the tanks. His name Is William
Seigleman. He is an ex-convict, having
served a five-year term In San Quentln
for a burglary committed In Los Angeles.
While in the penitentiary he became ac
quainted with the safecrackers. who were
also serving- terms for burglary.
"I have been thinking all along that
when ballot/ were costing half a cent
each, before there was any printing . on
them." said the Registrar, "that the price
for the paper must be exorbitant. I there
fore visited reliable paper houses In thlg
city and secured statements from them
concerning the prices at which they would
furnish the same paper. I found that
the rates ranged from 4.5 cents per
pound to 6 cents, which was the" high
est. The offers were as follows: Bone
stell & Co., 5 cents per pound for 300 to
400 reams and 4.C3 cents per pound for a
carload; Blake, Moffitt & Towne, 4&
cents per pound for two carloads and 5^,
cents, per. pound for a. less quantity
Santa Clara Valley Paper Company, 6
cents per pound. The price charged by
the Secretary of State was $2.50 per ream,
which is at the rate of 12^4 cents a pound
I have received the following letter from
Bonestell & Co., to whom the ballot
paper was shown as the sample that they
refer to:

you on 300 or 400 reams of, paper, as -per your

"The bill was passed by the Election
Commissioners before they had any
knowledge that anything was wrong in
the price. After I had investigated I
told Mayor Phelan about what I had dis
covered and he then said that he would
veto the bill. I have seen his communi
cation to the Board of Supervisors.
Mayor Phelan wished me to be sure that
the facts were right.- I have written
communications from the three paper
firms that I have mentioned. I did not
call upon Zellerbach, because I am in
formed that he furnished the ballot paper
to the Secretary of State's office."
Mayor Phelan has vetoed the bill for
the paper, cent down from the office of
the Secretary/of State from Sacramento,
upon which the ofllcial ballots were
printed at the general election. He will
bring the matter before the Board of Su
pervisors at the meeting to "be held next
Monday. The bill has been approved by
the Election Commissioners. Since then
Registrar Walsh has been investigating
the paper market and he has been con
vinced that the county was charged at
least twice what the paper was worth
and could be bought for. Upon his In

Mayor, that official has based his veto.

Expert Adams Cnds room In hia esti
mates for some big items, the presence of
which gives Mr. Hayne room for much
examination. Adams figured that during
the first nineteen years of the Contra
Costa. Water Company's existence it suf
fered, a loss of $500,000. -At least he calcu
lated that as the difference between a to
tal of on bonds, dividends on
stock and outlay on new construction and
what would be the~ return from the cur
rent rate of interest on the capital stock.
By further calculation of losses and de
terioration of plant, which Adams claims
the consumers should be compelled to ;
meet, the engineer reached the enormous
total of $2,592,523 for the Contra Costa
plant, and excluding the Alvarado sys
tem. It is In the evidence that this forma
33 1-3 per cent of his total valuation or theÂ»
entire system upon which the water "com
pany asks the court to make a Judicial'
decree. This tremendous figure Is about
the same as the valuation which Adams
placed upon the Alvarado (Dlngee) plant.
In response to Mr. Hayne's questions,"
Mr. Adams said his figures on the Dingee
system were simply those for which It
had been purchased, namely, $1,500,000 in
bonds at par and $1,500,000 in stock worth
70 cents on the dollar. He had not calcu
lated the value . by actual cost ot the
works. â¢
He said the Alvarado system was worth
$2,550,000 to the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, because that was what the company
had paid for It.
The' Contra Costa plant up to 1883, Ad
ams said, had earned 5.62 per cent, but
he claimed It should have' earned 7 per
cent. Without estimating the so-called
losses and deterioration, Adams deter
mined that the plant would be worth 12.
592.000'by one estimate and $3,017,000 ac
cording to another that he had made. In
cluding the two omitted Items, his esti
mate ran up to $4 .600,000.
This Alvarado â¢ supply, which cost the
Contra Costa Company $2,550,000, has been
worked up to nearly its full limit, accord
ing to Engineer Adams. But the expert
thinks the supply is fairly well protected,
although he admitted . to Judge Hayne
that extensive development of the same
underground sources might Interfere with
the supply.'
Adams did not 'think there was much
danger of an Incursion Into the artesian
belt at Alvarado by other capital,- so upon
that ground and the . fact that the com
pany- controls 360 acres of land there he
thought' the supply* would not be Inter
rupted. . â¢ â¢ â¢ _ . â¢ . . '
1113 Broadway. Nov. 14.
The difference between an estimate of
value and actual cost based upon the ad
mitted meager records of the Contra Cos
ta Water Company has resulted In a wide
difference of opinion among the few ex
perts who have already testified for the
water company as to valuation of Its
plant. It Is purely a matter of specula
tion how much wider differences will de
velop as the small army of experts as yet
unheard are given a chance to exploit the
results of their Inquiries.
To-day was the third day of Expert Ad
ams' appearance on the witness stand,
and Attorney Hayne was not ready to Â«ay
at the close of the session when he would
be through with his cross-examination of

Accident Before Their Wounds

* Three Chinese injured in a railroad ac
cident some live miles below San Lucas,
Monterey County, early yesterday morn
ing were bumped around the streets last
night, fourteen hours after the accident,
until some place could ' be found where
their injuries might be treated! Â¦'-
The injured Chinese were part of a sec
tion gang employed by the Southern Pa
cific Company. They left their camp early
yesterday morning and some hours later
were found lying on the side of an em
bankfnent. They say their car was run
Into by a train. â¢ - â¢
The sufferers were placed on an incom

end streets about 6 o'clock. They in
gaged a wagon to take them to China
town, but could find no place to receive
them. The doctors at thfe Railroad Hos
pital 6 Id not know anything about iho
affair so declined to receive the Chinese.

the finding: by detectives of one of the

Temple block. The outfit was provided
with a moFt elaborate paraphernalia, for
The transmission and handling of elec
tricity in operations direct upon the big

The police believe that French and his
partner. Tessler. who were caught with
much the Fame port of an outfit, placed
the kit In hiding while making their pre
liminary ananperaents to attack tho
bank.
On the night of August 5 the bank was
entered by burglars, who opened tnÂ«
Washinirton-street door and wedged a
small jimmy at the bottom to steady the
door against pressure.
That jimmy was found In the morning,
end later the remarkable electrical out

was brought to light.

PRINCESS NEVER
LEGALLY ADOPTED
J. M. Bassett: Says That
C. P. Huntington; Told
Him So. .
Princess Hatzfeldt was never adopted by
the late C. P. Huntington' as his daugh
ter, and that the only relationship she
bore to him was that of the niece of. the
first Mrs. Huntingtonâ the child of the
sister of the railroad magnate's first wife.
Mr. Bsssett certainly knows much of the
affairs of the railroad and its builders,
and his statements are of Interest in view
of the threatened contest of the magnate's
will by the Princess.
"The Princess Hatzfeldt is the daughter
of a sister of the first Mrs. Huntington,"
said Mr. Bassett. "The first Mrs. Hunt
ington-was a Miss Stoddart. and her sis
ter married a man named Prentiss, and
they had one daughter, now the Princess
JIatzfeldt. Mr. Huntingdon told me in
18S2 that he had never adopted her and
did not intend to, but that he 'would do
well by her.' He told me that her father
was drowned in the Sacramento River,
and that her family was poor and that he
intended to take care of her.
"Mr. Huntington told me that he had
frequently consulted with his first wife
as to the disposition of their property,
and that they had agreed upon a list of
relatives to be remembered, and that he
had carried out her wishes, and that the
Princess Hatzfeldt was not Â¦ on the list,
she having received large sums during his
life.
"There was some little trouble over her
husband, the Prince, who was Â¦ loafing
around New York with a title and lots of
debts. It became unpleasant, and Hunt
ington finally told them that ne would
give them $3,000,000 if they would go to
Europe and stay there. They got $1,000,000
In his will.
"Frora what I know I am satisfied that
there was never an adoption of the Prin
cess, and If she should break the will it
would only 1 , result in the widow taking
one-third of the estate and his adopted
son, the child of his second wife by her
first husband, woui> <ret the remainder."

THE steam whaler Grampus got
back from the Arctic yesterday
after spending two seasons in the
frozen north. During that time
thirteen whales were taken, so
that in round figures the ship haa a $150,
000 catch. Only 27,000 pounds of bone
came down on the vessel, the remainder
having been sent home on the whaling
tenders.
One of the most remarkable of tha
Grampus' crew is Tommy George. He
went to the Arctic on the Mary D. Hume
in 1893 with Captain Leavitt. On that
occasion the Hume remained three years
In the ice and made a phenomenal catch.
When she was coming home In 1836 Tom
my transferred to the Newport at Her
8chel Island, and in 1897, when he was on
his road home, the Newport was frozen
in off Point Barrow. When In August,
1S38, the Newport, got clear Tommy left
her at Point Hope and went whaling on
the beach with the Esquimaux. In 1833
Captain Leavitt of tha Grampus picked
subscribing members of the Harbor Re
publican Club and a few other . Invited
guests on board the steamer Carolina In
a ratification cruise Tuesday night The
steamer, gaily decorated with flaes and il
luminated with ChinesÂ© lanterns, left
Jackson-street wharf at 8:30 o'clock and
cruls?d along the front and down the bay
past Hunters Point, reaching the wharf
on the return shortly after. 11 o'clock.
About forty guests were aboard.
The after deck was inclosed and pro
vided with chairs and a piano. Refresh
ments were served and a "jinks" was
given, of the kind for which Captain Leale
and the Caroline are famous. Robert
Lloyd sansr several songs. Captain Leale,
Captain Iko Smith, Charles Pratt, the
Pilot Commissioner, and Captain J. E.
AlcCulloch told stories. Henry Madison
gave several piano solos. A quartet
composed of Messrs. Lloyd, Wilson, Mad
ison and Pratt sang popular sonprs, the
company joining: in the choruses. The hit
of the evening was made by John Lund
berg, chief officer of the Caroline, with
his sailor shanties.

BLANCHE PARTINGTOX.
The chorused; "Hymn to ' Ptha," the
measured and. massive march, the hymn
ing priestess psalm in the. distance, were
given most beautifully, and the orchestra
was wonderful throughout. A most inter
esting feature is the work of thfe ballet,
the symbolic dances and mysterious evo
lutions of a large corps of* perfectly
trained danseuses. In fact we have every
thing that "they" have in Europeâ stars,
staging chorus, orchestra, ballet, every
thing â let us enjoy while we may and be
grateful to the strange and wonderful
chance that has brought these things to
our distant door.
on the whole, rather conventionally con

Journet. and Miss Bauermelster was well
heard as the > priestess.
Last night two of the men occupying a
tent in Camp 5 were wakened by a slight
noise. Slipping out of their blankets they
tried to crawl noiselessly from the tent,
but unfortunately one of them struck. a
box, making considerable racket. A form
Was seen rushing from the rear of the
tent, and the disturbed occupants started
in pursuit. The pursued was fleet of foot
and would have made his escape had ho
not fallen over one of the tent ropes. Be
fore he could regain his feet the pursuers
were upon him. On being brought to the
light it was discovered that he> was
Charles Nelson, a colored recruit from
Camp 1. By this time all the upper por
tion of the casual camp had been dis
turbed, and the men were out of the
tents. On being informed of the cause of
the great amount of noise, and that at
last the thief had been captured, an im
promptu lynching party was organized. A
rope was quickly secured and thrown over
Kelson's neck. Fortunately a colored
trooper ran to Sergeant Henderson's
quarters and told him of Nelson's serious
predicament. Not stopping to dress, but
grabbing his revolver, the sergeant ran to
the scene, arriving Just in time. Only
when the sergeant threatened to shoo;
would the irate soldiers give ux> the negro.
He was finally released by the crowd and
escorted to the guardhouse and locked up.
A serious affair was averted last night
at the Presidio by the prompt action of
Sergeant Henderson, who Is In charge of
the casual camp. For some time _ past
many articles belonging to the reÂ«ruits
have been stolen from the tents, and ev
ery effort to catch the thief proved fruit
less.

T0 LYNCH THIEF
he should say that "Aida" Is an old story
to him, but there was nothing lacking in
vim and verve in the work and the wou
derful sextet and ensemble in the thlr.1
scene were given with smashing effect.
Nordica was the "Aida" of the evening,
and at first a little disappointing. Her
voice seems to have sharpened since hor
last visit here a few years ago, and her
curiously unsuitable make-up â another in
the long list of Aida-in-her-variety with
which we are familiar hereâ rather added
to the feeling of disappointment. Italian
opera is not Nordlca's metier. Her great
work has b^en done in Wagnerian opera,
and that is where we shall ereet again the
great artist whose Iiiunnilde save so
much delight when last we heard her. But
as the evening progressed Nordlca's voice
freshened and sweetened, and In the Nile
scene her solo and duet with Radames
was exquisitely given and vociferously ap
plauded.
Mme. Louise Homer Is new to us. AjÂ»
Amneris last night she created a very fa
vorable Impression, being fair to look
upon, exceedingly graceful and with a
contralto voice of extraordinary compass
and smooth, fine, if rather cold, quality.
She Is an intellectual rather than emo
tional actress, and leaves the impression,
both as to acting and singing, that" slie
has not yet reached the height of her pos
sibiltles.
Much dramatic power has Imbart de la
Tour, Radames for the nonce, and a ro
bust tenor voice, not alwaye smoothly
managed nor always quite inÂ«tune, but he
rises to a nne climax arid is a very suf
ficients Radames. Plancon has a -rare
voice, a vibrant, regnant voice, and a
magnificent presence, which 'showed to
fine advantage In the splendid ' robes' of
Ramfis. And how he does sing!
Amonasro is undertaken' by>M.i. Scottl,
and a noble barbarian he is.' He has a
good barytone, warm-blooded and of dra
matic timbre: but it is not very even in
production 1 and has a certain roughness of
fiber, which latter quality, however, seems
to suit the role. He has his moments'of
dramatic intensity, but, the Amonasro Is,

BfiL performance of "Aida" which Mr.
Grau gave us for the evening's
programme. Not that the au
dience was large, the ribuse being only
moderately filled â and oh me! -I fear for
the fate of any future season In j San
Francisco: But this is a Verdi constitu
ency. , For long years the old Italian
maestro has had the musical freedom 'of
the town, and everything he has written
goes, willy-nilly and without question.
And I mean nought of disrespect by this
to the grand old man of Italy, who ' has
linked the past and present of Italian
cpera in his own person, and written best
what he has last written."* But it Is suffi
cient that '.Verdi's name heads the pro
gramme to insure an inevitable enthusi
asm in San Francisco, no matter what
the opera.
For one thing Italian opera is a sort of
encore-made-easy affair, the high note the
cue, and one must be stupid indeed not
to be able to win some small, inexpensive
glory at least once in an evening by lead-
Ing the palm symphony. It is different
with "Wagnerâ most things are different
with Wagnerâ but the "rounded period "
is not in evidence and applause is a
finicking quantity with neither- high note
nor tonic to guide! Therefore the com
parative ease â¢ of â¢ applausto between last
evening and Tuesday evening with "Tann
hauser" for temptation is no sure, crite
rion of enjoyment, especially when the
vigor of the Damrosh curtain calls is re
membered, r
"We had Mancinelll on the stage, too,
at the end of the Nile'scene, by long odd*
the finest part of the performance. The
Italian conductor is a master of -his work,
handling the huge orchestra and chorus
with supreme skill and utmost ease. He

Through Provisions of Which the

in Investigation.
The condition of the Pilarcltos plant also
eeemed to be surrounded by a maze of
doubt. Mr. Ames was unable to testify
as to the condition of the property or
what portions were now In use. Reed's
constant probing caused Ames to show
some temper, which l^d Brandrnstein to
supgeet an abandonment of the line of ex
amination until the engineering depart
ment of the company could be subpenaed.
Reed unwillingly complied. and Mr.
ForbeF, an engineer, was put under fire.
Forbes knew nothing about the PHarcitos
plant and Assistant Engineer B. II. Hen
derson was nought out of the crowd and
put on the stand.
Outsit'e of the facts that the old dam
wa5 of no use at this time, and that the
T.ater flowed from Pilaroitos through a
tunr.el and thence into a pipe line, he
knew nothing. As to the uses to which
the %3(f)fi"0 flume is being put he. was In
total lg;iorance.
Engineer Forbes was recalled and his
c-vider.t knowledge of the affairs of the
corporation, coupled with his evident in
clination to retain his knowledge within
hi? bosom, led to some debate among
members of the board as to the authority
10 direct Mr. Forbes, personally, instead
of the corporation, to furnish a complete
lnvÂ«"rtory of the properties in u=e by the
company. The mattrr was disposed of by
requesting, not ordering, Mr. Forbes to
eupply th.s inventory.
Reed, Brandenstein and McCarthy took
up the matter of the Point Lobos Creek
property, purchased In the early days by
the Spring Valley Company, but which,
owing to the danger of contamination
from the graveyards in the vicinity, has
been abandoned for five years. Mr. Ames
testified that $20,000 was expended on this
propertv in Improvements Jufit prior to its
"abandonment." Mr. Kellogg, who repre
sents the corporation, didn't like the word
"abandon," and asserted that the prop
erty had not been abandoned in fact, but
vr&p only lying idle until such time as the
engineers could devise a plan to place it
in operation. Mr. Reed asked Kellogg if
he wi^h~d to so testify. Kellogg refrained
and asked that the board fonlinue the in
vestigation of the Point Lobos property
until the return of the engineers.
Ames mounted the stand with a written
statement of affairs, but after a minute's
reading- he gave way to D. J. Bassett ot
the Rlsdon iron Works, who was called
upon to give the cost of the Lake Merced
pumping plant. Bassett said the plant
cost tne Spring Valley Company J',5.200.
McCarthv had found a plant in the Mast
of but slightly smaller capacity which
could be purchased for $5200. Baesett went
into a recitation on "weight of metal,"
â¢'Â¦wearing properties"' and â¢"reliability" and
was soon dismissed. Ames tÂ«ok his place
on the stand.
Keed came forward with another resolu
tion providing lor the appointment of an
cxpt-rt bookKeeper and an engineer to aid
the board In its investigation. Reed ad
mitted that Just at this tljie the experts
ini-re not necessary, but, he. said, he was
ol the opinion that it was Just as well
to provide Jor their appointment at this
time. Hotaling suggested that although
ell would neea a col tin in time he knew
of none that was providing for the same,
8no he suggested that the experts be
provided for when the time came. Mc-
Carthy came to Reed's support and de
t-I-ite Hotallng's protest the resolution
passed.
Reed also presented a resolution provid
ing for the .Board of Public Works secur
ing data on all water plants throughout
the United States which supply l.'JW.uOO
or more gallons a day. McCarthy sug
gested that both pump and gravity sys
tems be included, and as amended the
i evolution passed.
This ended the resolutions. By them
positions were prepared for filling 'Â¦ and
more responsibility was laid on the shoul
dtrs of the Board of Works.
Braunhart iollowed Keed with a. resolu
tion providing lor action on the part of
the cierk to ascertain the assessed valua
tion of the real and personal property of
the Spring- Valley Water Company under
the asses-snienc levied on the nrst Mon
day in March, 1:WO, in the counties in
â¢which the property is situated. The reso
lution was adoptea.
Reed presented the Jirst resolution. It
provided for the presentation of a state
ment of the amount of money actually
expended by the company since com-
Diencing business in purcba&ing property;
Â«Jso the amount of money expended for
th& maintenance of its plant and the
amount expended in construction, the
items in each case applying to property
necessary to conduct the business. The
company was also asked to give the gross
receipts for each year since the organiza
tion of the corporation. This resolution
v.ajÂ» ordered adopted by Mayor Phelan in
the absence of a protest.
Sitting as a committee of the whole
the Board of Supervisors continued their
investigation of the affairs of the Spring
Valley Water Company last evening for
ihe purpose of fixing water rates for the
ntxt fiscal year. Prior to continuing the
examination of Pelham W. Ames of the
wstcr company various members of the
board, led by Mr. Reed, augmented the
record with sundry resolutions, the pro
visions of which, it is believed, will aid
the board in reaching Its conclusion.

Chairman Mark yesterday directed -"W.

mandamus proceedings to compel Super
intendent Webster to sign P. M. Wel
lln's demand as inspector of building
repairs. This action is the result of a
change of base on the part of City At
torney Lane and the Auditor's attorneys,
LJoya & Wood, who rendered a verbal
opinion last week that the signature of
the Superintendent -was not. necessary on
demands for schoolhouse repairs. After
further investigation Wells' *v attorneys
filed a written opinion, which is concurred
in by Lane, in which they say that after
a careful examination of the various pro
visions, of the code they are satisfied thaÂ»
the Auditor cannot audit the demand of
P. M. Wellln without the signature of the
Superintendent of Schools. After quot
ing the provisions of the charter on the
subiect. the opinion concludes: '
Â¦ "Hence It would appear that a demand

by .Superintendent "Webster and his depu
ties in order that they may arrive at an

Rules for Promotion.
The board met yesterday and adopted a
plan for the promotion of the advanced
eighth grades to the High School. The
principal rules provide that pupils of this
grade who have made an average of 70
per cent for the current term shall be
eligible to enter the examination for pro
motion to the. High School. For promo
tion an average of 70 per cent shall be re
quired, which shall be found by averag
ing the term's standing with that ob
tained in the examination.
Superintendent Webster objected to pro
moting pupils on their average standing
in all subjects. He took the ground that
pupils should.be required to make a stipu
lated average in each subject. The board,
however, believes that a pupil who fails
in one subject, for example in * arith
metic, and passes In all the others is de
serving of promotion.
"I protest against these rules for pro
motion," said . Webster, "because they
fall to specify some minimum percentage
necessary to secure promotion in indi
vidual subjects. I would fix that miml
mum at 60 per cent, because under your
rules a pupil could get zero in arithmetic,
for* Instance, and yet his percentage in
the other studies would bring his rating
up to the average of 70 per cent required
by the board. I do not believe this plan
will result in good work or good school
ing."
The other rules of promotion are:
The examination for girls will be held In
the Girls' High School and for boys . in the
Lowell High School and shall be conducted by
the principals of said high schools. Papers
shall be kept on file under the direct care or
the principals of the said high schools for a
period of six 1 months.
All teachers of the advanced eighth grade
In schools the names of which begin with the
letters of the alphabet, from A to H Inclusive,
shall report at the Girls' High School on the
morning of the examination and shall assist
the teachers of said high schools in correcting
the examination papers.
All teachers of the advanced eighth grade
in schools the names of which begin with the
letters of the alphabet from I to Z. both In
clusive, shall report at the Lowell High School
on the morning of the examinations and shall
assist the teachers of said schools in correct
ing the examination papers. ' .
The order of examinations shall be as fol
lows, five studies, 100 credits each: Monday,
December 17,' 1900, 9 a. m., arithmetic; Tues
day, December IS, 1900, 9 a. m., language.- In
cluding literature and grammar; Wednesday,
December 19, 1900, 9 a. m., geography, through
eurasla and spelling; Thursday, December 20.
1900, 9 a. m., history (through topic 43), in
cluding civil government.
Alt advanced eighth grades not promoted to
the high schools become a part of the eighth
grade and shall be eligible for promotion at
the close of the school year with the other
eighth grades.
The average standing of pupils must be pre
pared and certified to by Principals Morton and
Brooks In triplicate, one copy to be filed witd
the secretary of the Board of Education, an
other to be sent to the principal of each school
represented in the examination and the third
to be kept on file In the office of the high
school principal conducting the examination.
These reports must be ready to be delivered
Friday, December 21, 1900, 12 m.. at which time
the Janitor of each school represented shall
call for the required list, so that : principals
of said schools may notify advanced eighth
grade pupils of promotion or non-promotion
and make proper classification of their schools
before 3 p. m. Friday, December 21.
In all grades except the advanced eighth
grade for the term ending December 21. 1900,
principals, after consultation with the class
teachers, shall promote pupils to the next sec
tion of the same grade or the next grade.
Cost of Cooking Schools.
Director Kincaid submitted a state
ment of the cost of fitting- up cooking
schools as follows:
