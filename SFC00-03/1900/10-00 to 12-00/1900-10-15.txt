POPE FAVORS AMERICAN
RULE IN PHILIPPINES
Insurgents Make Three Futile At
tempts to Open Negotiations
With the Vatican.
GENEVA, Oct. H.-Bellamy Storer.
United States Minister to Spain, in the
course of a conversation here to-day re
garding his recent interview with the
Pope, said:
"Leo appeared to be in much better
health than when I saw him two year*
ago. He is full of life and has lost none
of the interest he has had from the first
in matters relating #> the church of
Rome.
"Since Archbishop Ireland's visit to the
Vatican It Is deeply understood there that
the best interests of the Roman Catholic
church demand American rule in the Phil
ippines. The United States and the Cath
olic church have the same aims there, and
hope to work together for order and
peace."
Mr. Storer asserted that the Filipinos
had made throe attempts to open nego
tiations with the Vatican, all of which
were refused.

Mr. Bryan's chances of setting the elec
toral vote of New York. Herald will
to-morrow publish the results of a return
postal card poll of voters of New Ybrk
City, made with a view of ascertaining
Jhelr Presidential preferences. A similar
poll, made by the Herald In 1S35, enabled
It to predict In August that ilcKlnley;
would have 281.000 plurality In the State*
The canvass which Is detailed In thÂ© Her
.ald now was conducted under exactly sim
ilar circumstances, but took in a larger
number of voters, more widely scattered
through the boroughs of Manhattan and
Brooklyn than in 1S36.
Deductions from the postal card poll In
dicate that the city of New York may
not grive a majority of more than 10,000 to
either Presidential candidate. The Great
er City is In doubt. Returns from the
borough of Manhattan seem to show that
Bryan will have about 13.030 plurality. Mc-
Kinley had about 21.000 plurality in Man
hattan and Bronx four years ago. Re
turns from Brooklyn indicate 24.000 plural
ity for McKinley. He had about 32,000 ta
1K>5. :V" ":iÂ»t-
If the poll foreshadows the result In the
city, then New York St^te is certain for
McKinley.
A number of Interesting facts were dis
closed by replies received by the Herald-
Gold Democrats who voted for Palmer
are almost overwhelmingly la favor of
McKinley now. The majority of new vo
ters are also for McKinley. The Pro
hibition vote does not show any signs of
Increasing. Debs. Socialist Labor can
didate, will poll mpre ' votea than Mal-
Ione>V the Democratic Labor candidate
for President.
' O'Dell.' Republican candidate for Gov
ernor, runs behind McKinley. There la
more Indecision about the Governorship
than about the Presidency. Many voters
say that they have not made up their
minds. So many blanks on the head of
the State ticket were returned that results
are not at all satisfactory as fonnlnsr a
basis for prediction. An analysis of the
figures of the first two day3 of registra
tion shows that increases downtown ara
small and that they have grown In Iar?s
proportions In the northern districts of

he must know that there is no warrant In fact
for the, statement as to the ice trust.
.In my message to the New York Legislature
I recommendedecrtain action about trusts. The
Legislature did not act along the line I sug
gested, but it did. pass a very stringent anti
trust bill " introduced by a Democrat, and I
signed It. The 'Attorney General Is now pro
ceeding asainlt the ice trust under this bill.
Mr. Croker and his fellow stockholders in the:
Ice trust, through their attorneys, ure fighting
us on technical legai points through ever}' stage
of the proceedings. - Â«.
Now. as I . said. Mr. Bryan knows all this
from my previous answer. He knows perfectly
v.e\l that I cannot "suppresisi the ice trust'*- In
any manner save by dne process of law. -and
that the Attorney General Is proceeding against
it under the law and is being hampered by the
delays Inevitable in attacking 'a corporation
well defended by able lawyers, retained, as la
natural, when the corporation contains stock
holders as wealthyias Jlr. Croker and his as
sociates. Mr. Bryan knows that where the
Attorney General Is undertaking these proceed
ings I have absolutely nothing to do with them.
He, therefore, knows that I have taken every
step that can be poÂ«?ibly taken in the matter.
Under these circumstances it is unnecessary for
me to comment upon his continual repetition of
a statement which he must know has not thÂ»
slightest foundation in fact.'. â - -
Whether the Ice trust can leeraUy be dissolved
is a question which, must be settled by the
cturts. .and. slml!arlj\ It Is a question t-> be
decided In accordance with'the law whether or
not any of the. Tammany leaders who hold
stock, in It' are amenable under the law. ThÂ«
trust Itself Is certainly one that can be iaid
to be a bad trust, dealing, as it does, in an
article of necessity for the poor of New York.
I. hav<; no doubt, however, that most of the
stockholders have Invested In It simply as they
would Invest In any ether corporation. ._.
.âThe striking point is that among the heaviest
6f< these Investors appear thÂ» Tammany Bryan-
It'* leaders who, in conjunction with Mr. Bryan.
ar? loudest In denouncing trust?. Hypocrisy
could j be carried no farther than it hut Â¦ beta
carried by these men and their defenders. In
the Tammany State Convention- in New York
.they artuatly denounced the Ice trust In their
political capacity. Â¦ while In their private capa
city they were stockholders In It. and through
their, counsel were dotn? everything to pre
vent its dissolution by the Attorney General.
Mr. Bryan i? now jroing to New York to be
the political (ruest.'of Mr. Croker. the Ice trust
tx-neflciary- He Is going there to try to help
Mr. Croker get control of the State of New
York and brtnsr It down to the level of irjfamy
to which the Tamnjany government has reduced
th* city of New York.
Again It comes to ras that this needs no fur
ther comment than is implied in the statement
of the' facts." Faithfully yours.

Here since early morning, eigh

situated in the center of a farm compris

out that the train would proceed at once
to Lexington, but a secret order directed
that It stop over Sunday In the country
to enable the Governor to recover from
the fatig-ue caused by his hard work of

from Mr. Dickinson:

done to throttle the ice trust? Answer m*
that. But then you know thÂ« Republican. Gov

was* understood when the German j
mander consented to it? occupancy that j
it would be given up on demand, but th: j
demand caused the American army oftl- :
cials no little embarrassment and incon- j
venience.
As a result the American force? are
row scattered. The Fifteenth Infantry.
Colonel Moale. commanding-, and at pres
ent senior American officer in Tientsin. Is
located in the buildings and compound of
the American Methodist Mission. A quar
ter of a mile further down the Taku road
is the camp of the Third Artillery, in the
compound of the property of Mr. Drew,
an American. The marine battalion Is
quartered in the buildings of the British
concession, the officers occupying several
houses in Victoria terrace. The commis
sary and quartermasters' depots are on
the Bund in the old Tier.trln hotel.
Two events of this week which were
pregnant with possibilities have been
pleasantly adjusted and have left no ap
parent trace of feeling. One was the kill-
Ing of Corporal Hughes of D Battery,
Third Artillery', and the wounding of a
private of the same battery by a French
sentry. The whole affair was unfortunate,
but an "investigation disclosed that the
sentry wa-s not to blame. It appears that
the Americans were out after dark and
had been drinking. They were halted by
a pentry on the French pontoon bridge,
and. disregarding his challenge, they tried
to rui=h him. One of the men fired his re
volver, discharging four chambers, when
the- sentry firM. killing Hughes. He was
attacked by the second American, whom
ho bayoneted, inflicting a slight wound.
The other instance was a slight tilt be
tween th*Â» British and Russians. The
former had posted a guard over a pile of
wood and hoisted a British flag. A Rus
sian guard, according to report, made an
attempt to seize the wood, also hoisting a
flag and threatening to cut down the
British colors. General Lorne-Campbell
happened to be on the scene at the time,
unaccompanied. Seeing the gravity of
the situation, he asked an American offi
cer to assist him, explaining that.he~feax
ed that tho two guards, who were Indians
of the Bengal Lancers, might precipitate
trouble. The American consented to re
main while the general sought the Rus
sian commander. Admiral Alexieff Imme
diately recalled tne Russians when the
matter was explained to him and apolo
gized for their action. It Is reported all
the men were punished.

interpreter of the legation that the repre
sentatives of his Imperial Majesty the
Krr.peror cf Germany were not receiving
social calls at present from Chinese offi
cial?. At the Spanish legation, where,
also, the French Minister resides, as his
residence was destroyed, the call lasted
only twelve minutes, and at the Austrian

tion over an hour Â¦was spent.
From there the American legation was

Mr. Conger and the members of the lega

he felt ashamed to look him In the face.
Personally he had done all in his power
to prevent the catastrophe that had oc

ed tco much for him. Ching said that he
had merely come to pay a visit of respect

It isÂ» stated on reliable authority that at
the Japanese legation Ching was informed
that Japan v.as utterly opposed to Any
division qf China by tue powers, and that
both England and America would stand
by her in this demand; that China would
have to pay very heavily for the trouble
she had caused, but it would not be in
loss of territory.
The consensus of opinion of the Amer
ican and British Ministers and generals
is that seldom, if ever, in the history of
the world has any city been more com
pletely looted than Peking, and it Is
mainly due to the influence of General
ChatTee and the British general. Caselle.
that the sacred city Itself has not suf
fered the same fate. In fact most of the
members- of the embassies, their families
and even* the missionaries think that a
great mistake was made in not looting
it and burning It to the ground. They
argue that if all the property of the mer
chants, bankers, pawnbrokers, and even
tne houses of the very poor, have been
looted and burned, why should the prop
erty of those mainly responsible be saved
and held sacred for their future use?
It is an every-day sight to see soldiers,

Frederick. Reports now, however, are fa

BERLIN, Oct..l4.â Last week the Bourse
had a severe setback, which wiped out the
advance made the week before. There
were numerous factors exerting an unfa
vorable influence upon speculation. The
Chinese situation is now considered unfa
vorable. The rise in New York exchange
and the unsatisfactory condition of the
Iron and coal trades depressed values
generally.
Coal shares had the worst week perhaps
of the last six months. "Westphalian
newspapers have asserted that the sup
plies are likely to outrun the demand
after next April. Many standard coal
shares fell more than ten points. The
money market has grown apprehensive
that German gold will go to New York
exchange having reached a point at which
the demand cannot be satisfied. Never
theless, "nothing is known here of exports
of gold to confirm the report cabled from
the United States, although it Is admitted
that New York bankers were making in
quiries here during the early part of the
week. There is high authority for the
statement that no gold has been taken
from. the Reichsbank for export.
Private discount rose to 4^4 on Friday,
in sympathy with London, but call money
remains abundant at from 3 to 3y^ per
cent. While the Reichsbank state'ment
showed a more unfavorable movement
than In 1S99, the status remains much
stronger than then. The bank does not
contemplate advancing the rate.
Government funds showed little change
Three-and-a-halfs improved slightly and
threes remained about stationary. The
loan is at 100 6-10, but no sales are report
ed at that figure. Bank stock fell from
two to four points during the week. Do
mestic railways declined heavily during
the early part of the week, but regained
somewhat yesterday.
Northern Pacific shares rose sharply
yesterday, more than refraining the
ground lost earlier in the week. Other
Americans attracted but little interest.

on Thursday arrived here by river boat
at 10 o'clock to-night, in consequence of
the washouts which occurred on every
branch of the Canadian Pacific in New
Brunswick on Thursday. The eastbound
express was caught at Green Point and
for three days could not move a mile. The
passengers were taken into Fredericton
Junction and cared for. To-day the twen
ty-mile Fredericton branch had been par
tially repaired and the passengers were
taken into Fredericton with a transfer at
Glaziers, where there is still a 200-foot
gap. At Fredericton. the passengers were
put on a river boat which made the eigh
ty-two-mile run to St. John in six hours.
If will be at least a week before the
damage on the forty miles of the main
line between St. John and Fredericton

permit the resumption of traffic and the
river route will be used until then.

ST. PAUL, Minn.. Oct. 14.â A remarka
ble series of experiments was conducted
here to-day by Henry Floyd of New, York,
who successfully accomplished the feat
of dairying 30.200 volts of electricity
through an Underground cable three miles
long. The highest voltage hitherto attain
ed with this olass of conductor was 20.000
volts, which was secured at Niagara
Falls, ajid electrical engineers have long
been experlmentinc with a view to at
taining a maximum of 25,000 volts.
The cable consists of three copper con
ductors, each about the size of an ordi
nary lead pencil, each being enclosed in a
paper tube and the whole encased in a
lead sheet and drawn through vitlrifled
clay conduits. The cable is part of the
system by which the St. Paul Gas. Light
and Power Company will utilize the water
power at Apple River, Wls., the other
twenty-four miles of wire being overhead.
As a result. of this experiment they will
carry an average voltage of 25,000 volts,
furnishing 6000 horse power for lighting

States, having 115 electoral votes, certain
for Bryan; 6 States, having 38 electoral
votes, in which the chances of Republi
can or Democratic success are even, and
3 States, having 24 votes, in which the
chances are CO to 40 in favor of the Dem

on the last reports received from all
the States, and is as follows: I

Our company will be glad to discuss the mat

to meet us ivlth, a view of going 1 back to work
without regard to what SchuylklU operators

Before giving the statement Mr. Wa*

among them Superintendent Lathrop c{
the Lehigh Valley Coal Company ac
"Wllkesbarre. and it received unanimous
approval. The fact that J. P. Monran

Pennsylvania Coal Operators Not in
Favor of Granting Further Conces
sions to the Unions.
SHAMOKIN. Pa.. Oct. 14.â The terms of
the Scranton convention are not accept
able to operators and representatives of
coal-carrying companies in this place and
Mount Carmel. The Reading officials do
not think the sliding scale will be abol
ished by the company, while operators are
averse. to slening â¢Â» contract binding them
to pay the 10 per cent Increase until April.
There Is a fear prevalent in this region
that if some of the men do return to work
trouble probably would arise through the
efforts of the strikers to persuade the
men to remain on strike. All the collieries
that are working . still retain heavy
guards.
HAZLETON, Oct. 14.-The Individual
coal operators who could be seen here to
day declined to discuss the action taken
by the anthracite miners' convention at
Scranton yesterday. Neither would they
gay what steps the employers would prob
ably take. It is evident from their retl
cenctf that the individual mine-owners are
awaiting to know what the mine carriers
will do. It is reported iri the coal region
to-night that the presidents of the com
panies will hold a conference In Xew York
to-morrow for a discussion of the action
of the convention. *
There was a story afloat to-^ay that the
operators would accept the convention's
decision, but nothing has come to the sur
face in thi3 region on which to base the
report.
The United Mine Workers' officials say
they are now again waiting on the oper
ators and that they will continue to close
the collieries that have been In operation
since the strike began, several weeks ago.
There are many reports In circulation
that If the strike continues much longer a
break in the ranks of the idle men will
occur. President Mitchell and his asso
ciate officials, however, reassert their con
fidence that the men, both union and non
union, will remain away from the mines
until after the strike Is declared off.
Superintendent Chase of the Lehigh
Coal Company said: "Not much de
pendence can be placed on the men when
it comes to arbitration. This was shown
in tho case of Mr. Markle.- He favored
arbitration, but at the behest of Mr.
Mitchell his miners repudiated the agree-,
ment they made with their employer. The
demand of the strikers that the operators
should agree to pay the Increased wages
for a fixed period is too arbitrary, and the
operators will hardly agree to It."
Despite the views of the operators, the
Impression here Is that the strike will be
ended this week.
WILKESBARRE. Pa., Oct. 14.-A can
vass of the operators of the Wyoming
Valley to-day shows that there Is consid
erable opposition to granting the miners
any more concessions than those outlined
In the original offerâ namely. 10 per cent
increase without any conditions. The In
dividual operators especially are opposed
to tying themselves up* to any agreement.
One operator said the only way the strike
could be settled was for the strikers to
accept the 10 per cent without any pro-
Visions.

Brooklyn last night. Mr. Walmsley has
in his possession a draft for Â£4S0 on the
London and San Francisco Bank at 71
Lombard street, London, besides* a gold
watch and chain and some valuable se

When found on the street last night Mr.
Walmsley acted so erratically that he was

STILL HAVE FAITH IN
THE PANAMA CANAL
Officers of the Company Believe They
Have a Better Route Than
by Nicaragua.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.-M. Hutin, direct
or general and president of the board of
directors of the Panama Canal Company;
General Abbott, chief engineer, and w!
N. Cromwell, counsel for the canal com
pany, were passengers on the steamer La
Touralne from Havre.
. "The Panama Canal Company," said
General Abbott, "is waiting for the rec
ommendation of the Walker Commission
to Congress and for the action of that
body. I believe that the decision will be
in favor of the Panama canal as being'
more feasible, economical and giving bet
ter results. If the decision is against the
Panama canal the company will never
theless go on building it. I believe that
Jf both the Panama and Nicaragua canals
are built nine-tenths of the vessels will
choose the Panama canal as being the

NZED NEW MACHINERY.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.-A letter re-
celved at the United States I>epartment
of Agriculture from Penrith College, New
South, Wales, Australia, calls attention to
the great need of improved types- of
agricultural machines In that colony. The
writer states that there are not half a
dozen machines for cutting and collecting
maize in New. South Wales, and a ma
chine for cutting sugar cane would be
ereatly appreciated by the cane growers
in the north of that colony and in Queens
land. He suggests that there are great
opportunities there for American manu
facturers of agricultural machines who
are desirous of .extending their business
outside of the United States.

TACOMA. Oct. 14.â That the middle fork I
of the Koyukuk River will become famous
for its cold diggings is claimed by Thom
as E. MeNamer of Forest Grove. Ore.,
who has arrived with news of another !
rich creek there. Emma Creek Is the
stream located by him. Through his de
velopment work and that of his a3so- '
elates It has bÂ«>tn demonstrated to be a |
great treasure producer. This creek is a j
tributary of the middle fork of the Koyu- |
kuk. It lies in th*Â» same locality as llyr- I
tie Creek, which Is referred to as Jihe El â¢
Dorado of the new district, and Is about
nine miles lens, with a number of cold t
producing "pups." or short creeks, as
tributaries. !
MeNamer brought out about $300 worth I
of nuggets, which he and his friends took
from Emma Creek gravel. They consti
tute as pretty a collection of gold speci
mens as ever came from the north, rang
ing In value from $5 to $1CO. The largest
nugget is a curious product of erratic gla
cial action. It Is bent and twisted into
fantastic shape. MeNamer reached' the
district June 25 and left August 20 for the
outside. Considering the dlsadvantages
under which he labored, his work in the
Koyukuk district cculd hardly have been
more remunerative. Jn twelve days he
and six other men took $90<v> from claim
No. 2. They prospected the creek for
some distance, finding everywhere pros-

TELEGRAPHIC BREVITIES.
Yet another of the princely domains be
longing to the Napoleons is about to pass
out of the possession of this family; for
the Chateau de Pranginp, which was for
merly the residence of Jerome Bonaparte,
and afterward that of Prince Jerome Na
poleon, is offered for sale, together with
the magnificent estate which surrounds
it. This Is due to the fact that Prince
Louis Napoleon, who has been ever since
he came of age the scapegrace member
of his family, has recently lost such enor
mous sums of money at cards that he can
only find the wherewlthall to pay ' his
"debts of honor" by celling this 'truly
regal estate, of which his father and
grandfather . before him were so proud.
The Empress Eugenie, who, if she had so
willed It. could have with tho neatest
ease helped Prince Louis out of these
new financial difficulties, is by no means
inclined to do so; not only because she Is
the reverse of generous, but also because
she simply abhors both Louis and Victor
Napoleon.â Pittsburg Dispatch,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 14.â With her
decks swept of all but one of her life
boats and all the movable gear carried
away, the tramp steamer Buckingham
arrived this afternoon from the Orient.
She had a cargo of East India sugar
on board for the British Columbia relin
ery, ZIM tons in all, which Is the largest
sugar cargo ever brought to this port.
The Buckingham left Tjiltjap, Java, on
August 31 and coming across had one of
the roughest trips on record. Captain Wil
liam Cole says that on two occasions he
expected that foe vessel would founder.
On September 10 a typhoon came up and
lasted until the 12th, but it was completely
outshadowed in violence by a typhoon
which began on the morning of the 16th.
Th-sy were just on the outer edge of the
China Sea, steering uf> toward tne Japan
Coast in the great semicircular steam
ship rcute across the Pacilic. All night
of the lbth the storm continued, one of
the heaviest ever seen by those on board,
fcarly on the morning of the 17th, when
the steamer was wallowing through the
troughs of mountain seas, great damage
was done. The engines were reduced to
half speed and the steamer was not mak
ing two miles an hour.
Three lifeboats were swept off within
ten minutes, and another went away half
an hour later. The waves swept tho
steamer from stem to stern.
TYPHOON ON FORMOSA.
Just before daylight, when every one
on deck was dodging the flying timbers,
the second mate. J. Stevenson, was swept
overboard. It is believed that he was
struck on the head as he went over the
rail, as he made little effort to swim. To
launch a boat was impossible, and the
officer sank within fifteen feet of the side
of the ship. He stayed above -water about
four minutes, but made no attempt to
grasp a life buoy that fell â¢within four feet
of him. He was a native of Glasgow and
23 years of ace.
Captain Cole places the damage to his
vessel at between $S000 and $10,000. Dur
ing the remainder of her ions voyage the
ship met with very heavy head seas, and
had more than her share of bad weather.

RALLY AT MAYFIELD.
HANFORD, Oct. 14.â E. T. Cosper. Re
publican nominee for Superior Judge of
Kings County, delivered a spech here last
night that was confined almost entirely to
those whom he calls - his enemies, lie
commenced by giving his opinion of Tbe
Call and trying to explain how it was
that he voted for Burns for United States
Senator. He said that Bulla was his man
for Senator and he voted for him until
Bulla himself requested him to desist. Af
ter leavine Bulla he went to Scott. At
that time. Cosper declared. The Call be
gan to urge upon the Bulla and Scott
men to vote for The Call's candidate.
At first it cajoled, then it begged and
finally The Call began to threaten and
tried to coerce the Representatives to
vote for its man. When he refused to
support or have anything to do with Its
candidate. Cosper declared. The Call
threatened to ruin him. .l-ow well it was
keeping Its word could be seen, he said,
in an editorial recently publisned by that
paper, which was nothing more than an
article written for the purpose of re
venge because he refused to vote for The
Call's man for United States Senator.
To show The Call's bitterness, Cosper
said, when Bard was finally mentioned It
used every means to block his election,
so that California would be under a
cloud and the Republican party would be
censured for eross dereliction of duty,
and The Call could then spring that old
but homely phrase, "I told you so."
Cosper roasted one of Hanford'a lead
ing merchants, saying that he was giving
out Calls containing the recent editorial.
He also went after the Republicans who
are not supporting him for Judge and
was especially bitter against Republican
officials who are supporting Judge Short,
declaring that two years hence they
would.be looking for a place to light.
The speech was confined almost exclu
sively to abuse of his enemies and it will
act as a boomerang, as men who were nls
supporters before the speech was deliv
ered are now working- for his defeat.

yesterday with a buggy-whip was the
result of a punishment which he had ad

to play truant that afternoon. He said
the lad was always unruly, and a leader
pmong such boys. It was either for him
to gÂ«et the best of these boys or lose his

he whipped the child in the presence of
two other teachers, and the stick was a

not more than two feet long. Professor

to the flame of gossip.
A Call representative had an interview
with both Mrs. Taylor and Professor
Martin to-day. Mrs. Taylor said she had
a clear conscience, and had done but a
mother's duty. When a teacher, she said,
goes so far as to beat a boy until he Is
black and blue and the court does not
punish that teacher. It Is high time the
mother takes it in her own hands. She
eaid her boy had never been a bad boy
in school and never played truant In his
life. She had waited for an opportunity
to get even with the professor, and when
she noticed him in the crowd she took
the whip from her buggy and walked up
to the professor and cave him two lashes
across his face. Mrs. Taylor said the
professor had used more than a light
stick on her boy. It was a dried palm
branch two inches '.vide and about two
and a half feet Ions, beins as hard as a

one of the party's national leaders. To

there or elsewhere. As ihe phrase Is, he
is out- of politics. He is giving his whole
time to the practice of law. One of the
ablest of our public men, developed since
the close of the Civil War, a Rood lawyer,
a great parliamentarian, a most convinc

perience in national affairs, and while
still an active and comparatively a young
man. he Is lost to the public service
through the operations of as radical a

try. In Kentucky the men, with but few
exceptions, who co-opfrated with Mr.
Carlisle in srivinB to the Democracy of

In the political campaign now going on in Canada
the Conservatives attack the Lauricr Ministry for
granting a preferential tariff to British goods without
exacting a similar advantage for Canadian goods in the
British market. â¢ They argue that if Canada demand
such advantages the British Parliament will grant
them; and as a proof of the accuracy of the contention
they quote from a recent utterance of the Imperial
Trade Defence League the declaration:
"If the incoming Government fails to pass meas-
Of the two statesmen Chamberlain has unquestion
ably the larger political ideas and the greater personal
force. Holding the comparatively subordinate posi
tion in the Cabinet of Secretary of State for the Colo
nies, he has managed to make himself more potent
even than the Premier, and is to-day more talked of
than any other man in British politics. In that office
he has developed a programme of union between the
mother country and the colonies that, if carried out
with vigor, may lead to consequences of great impor
tance to the whole world.. It has even been said that
despite his training in the Birmingham school he is
ready to surrender Britain's free-trade policy for the
sake of arranging a commercial and industrial union
with Canada and Australia.
Salisbury is old, is in bad health, and in the nature
of things can hardly hold the Premiership much
longer. Long before the expiration of the seven years,
for which this Parliament was elected, he will prob
ably give way to some one else. There arc two can
didates for the succession, and they represent widely
different ideas of government. One of them, Balfour,
Salisbury's nephew, and an exponent of the traditions
of Toryism, is anything rather than a jingo imperial
ist. Should he attain the power to shape the policies
of the Ministry, Great Britain will remain compara
tively indifferent to what is known as "imperialism"
and will devote her energies to the carrying out of an
elabroatc programme of domestic reforms. On the
ether hand, Chamberlain, who was once a reformer of
the aggressive kind, has become just as aggressively
an imperialist, and in effice would not hesitate to sac
rifice domestic policies to far-reaching schemes of
empire.
In the very sunrise of their new power, however,
there arc clouds upon the prospects of the victorious
Conservatives. The battle has been won by what arc
known in Britain as "khaki tactics" â that is to say,
the voters have been induced to vote for the present
Ministry as an expression of their support of the
Government in the South African war. Beyond that
general approval nothing appears to have been clearly
determined by the voice of the people, and conse
quently a good deal of speculation is going on over
the question whether the fruits of victory will fall to
the lot of the Salisbury wing of the party or to the lot
of Joseph Chamberlain.
OUT of the general elections the British impe
rialists emerge with a triumph even greater
than they expected. The Liberals having"
neither a platform, a policy nor a leader have hardly
managed to elect members enough to form a faction
in Parliament; and unless the course of events should
develop something to strengthen Liberal Sentiment
in the country the great party of Gladstone may vanish
altogether and leave a free field for the formation -of
a strong Radical party to contest with the Conserva
tives the control of the Government.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
According to the reports, india-rubber is not, as is
generally supposed, the product of a single tree, but
on the contrary is produced from a variety of trees and
plants. Some of these flourish only in a moist soil and
atmosphere, while others thrive on stony soil, pro
vided they receive ample though intermittent rain
fall; but in all cases a tropical or subtropical cli
mate is requisite. Most of the india-rubber of South
and Central America and India is from trees, but in
the islands of the Indian archipelago the supply of
rubber is chiefly from a gigantic creeper, which in
five years' growth attains a length of 200 feet 'ani
from twenty to thirty inches in circumference, and
which yields annually from fifty to sixty pounds of
caoutchouc. Java, Sumatra, Penang, Singapore and
French Indo-China are already large producers of
crude india-rubber, or caoutchouc, and its production
111 the West Indies has been sufficient to indicate the
entire practicability of its being made an important
industry in Cuba and Porto Rico, as well as in the
Hawaiian, Philippine and Samoan Islands.
There has been received by the Treasury Bureau
of Statistics a publication detailing the efforts made
for the cultivation of the trees and plants in the British
colonies and particularly in those of Africa. The
publication is of interest to us because it tends to
confirm the expectation that we may yet produce
rubber in our own islands instead of having to import
it from foreign countries. Southern Mexico and
Central America are natural producers of india-rubber
in considerable quantities, and in our islands cultiva
tor will doubtless be profitable.
The cause of the rapid increase in the importations
i~, that manufacturers are continuously extending the
application of rubber to new lines of industry. A few
3 - cars ago rubber goods were of a comparatively few
kinds, now almost everything can be made out of
rubber; and many articles are much more serviceable
when of that material than when made of anything
else. Consequently the demand for rubber grows
faster than unassisted nature could supply it, and
human intelligence and energy have been set to work
to increase the output.
The value of the industry may be estimated from
the fact that more than $100,000,000 worth of india
rubber has been imported into the United States dur
ing the past four years, and more than $60,000,000
worth in the last two years. A decade ago the annual
importations of rubber amounted to about $15,000,000:
now they exceed $30,000,000 and are steadily in
creasing.
REPORTS from Washington announce that the
Department of Agriculture has begun ex
periments and inquiries in the direction of pro
moting the cultivation of india-rubber trees and plants
in the tropic islands now in our possession. It
appears that the British, have long been propagating
the cultivation of rubber in several of their colonies,
and the results have been such as to encourage similar
undertakings on the part of our Government.
THE CULTIVATION OF RUBBER.
A good feature to the situation is the lack of spec
ulation all over the country. All sections send in the
6ame report. Whatever business is being done is to
fill actual wants, and is therefore safe and legitimate.
Under this condition it is almost impossible to pro
duce any serious financial or commercial disturbance.
Our local markets continue in good shape. Aside
from the sharp decline in wheat, which was purely
sympathetic with Chicago, most staples are firm. The
export business of the port thus far this year shows
a material increase over the same period last year, and
the transports continue to take out- large quantities of
merchandise and forage to the Orient. This trade
has been a great blessing to San Francisco and Cali
fornia, and has kept business active, whereas it might
otherwise have been dull. The farmer is profiting
largely by the military operations in China and the
Philippines, as witness the rise in hay, oats, horses
and other products of the ranch. There has not been
a dull season in this city for nearly four years, and if
the election results in a continuation of the present
financial conditions . there is no reason why trade
should rot be good for another similar period.
The money market, too, showed interesting symp
tcms during the week. The unfavorable statement of
the New York banks at the close of the preceding
â¢week, coupled with large demands for money for the
South and West, raised rates somewhat and tended to
contract loans. The supply of funds in the New York
market for loaning purposes has been somewhat cur
tailed, but this condition is thought to be temporary,
as gold is again heading this way from Europe, and
the equilibrium is therefore automatically readjusting
itself.
General business is tame. The only event of the
week worthy of mention was the placing by the Penn
sylvania Railroad of an order for 150.000 tons of steel
rails at $j6 per ton. The order was divided among
half a dozen large companies. The production of iron
is being continually reduced, but nevertheless stocks
continue to gro;v here and there, showing that the
rroduction is still ahead of the consumption. It is
supposed, however, from the hand to mouth buying,
that supplies in consumers' hands are low. If this
prove true there i? a chance for a reaction in this in
c'ustry before longr. The ether staples run along about
the same. Sales of wool were rather larger last week,
and the shipments of r.cots and shoes also showed an
increase, accompanie-I by a firmer leather market and
nn advance of ]'iQ in hides at Chicago. The boot
and shoe trade is making rather the best showing of
s:ny line at present, s; orders are steadily increasing
and many of them are for immediate delivery. Some
of them are urgent, showing low supplies at many
points. The mills are also short of wool and are
buying more liberally. There is no speculation, as the
purchases go immediately into the mills. Cotton de
clined during the week, owing to improved crop pros
pects indicated by the official crop report. There was
feme commotion in the wheat trade, owing to a sud
den drop at Chicago, due, it was thought, to specula
tive manipulation there, as there was nothing in the
general condition of the market to cause a sharp de
cline.
THE condition of trade showed little variation
last week. The country's bank clearings fell off
again, losing 14.3 per cent against the corre
sponding week in 1899, but while the loss was larger
than for the preceding week there were more individ
r:al gains among the smaller cities. As far as thes^
clearings are an indication, this shows that the job
bing arid retail business of the country, otherwise
known as the distributive demand, is improving,
though the great wholesale trade of the important
centers rr.3y be quieter. The distributive improvement
is not likely to amount to much at present, however,
for nobody wants to branch out until after the elec
tion. The failures for the week were 223, against 164
for the same week last year.
A1ONEY flND MERCHANDISE
Some very. Interesting and eminently
practical trials took place some weeks
ago, in wfilch eleven of the principal ships
in the British squadron in the Mediter
ranean took part. The object of these
trials Is of such practical value as to
suggest that the plan was originated by
Rear Admiral Beresford. Similar trials
in our navy would give a more correct
Idea of the actual speed and coal con
sumption of warships than the four
hours' trial under forced draught now
conveys. In the following table are giv
en the original trial data of eight
hours' duration under full power (not
forced draught), which, with the figures
under four-flfths power, taken from the
London Engineer, furnish data of com
parisons that are very rare:
Experiments have been made at Shoe
buryness with 9.2-inch lyddite shells,
tired at a target 1500 yards distant from
the gun. When the shell burst frag
ments of it were hurled back 800 yards
toward the gun, and other pieces werÂ«
scattered over a distance of a mile, or
1760 yards. The detonation was , like a
clap of thunder, and persons a mile
away felt a heavy blow across their face*
from the concussion. While lyddite may
burst against armor without doing seri
ous harm, a well-planted shell of this
kind would annihilate a vessel without
considerable armor protection. The 9.2
inch lyddite shell will be introduced in
the naval service, with a further proba
bility of extending It to the 12-inch guns.

The British torpedo-boat destroyer Bull
finch, which has been undergoing repairs
since July 21 of last year, when an acci
dent occurred to her machinery result
ing in the less of eleven lives, had her
trials last month. The vessel developed
6022 horsepower and 29.46 knots speed dur
ing a three hours' continuous run, falling
short .54 knots of her contract speed.
Eleven armored gunboats, denominated
as the Insect class, have been struck
from the German navy list. Their names
are: Basilisk. Blene. Camaleon. Croco
dile, Hummel, Mucke. Xatter, Salamand
er, Skorplon, Viper and Wespe. They
are of 1109 tons, have an iron armor belt
of S Inches and carry one 12-inch and
two 14-pounders. They were all built at
the Weser yard, Bremen, between 1876
and 1SS0. and have long since become ob
solete; in fact, they were never of much
use. as they drew more water than in
tended.

Every workingman has many strong reasons why
he should vote for the party of prosperity, but organ
ized labor has a stronger reason than any other ele
ment in the country, for in the stronghold of Bryan
ism there is now going on a fight waged by Bryan's
supporters for the absolute extermination of labor
unions.
The men who are doing these things are support
ing Bryan in this campaign. They, with the Demo
crats of the other Southern States, constitute the most
potent of the many forces that are back of Bryan,
and should he be elected they will control his admin
istration. Thus to Crokerism in New York, Altgeld
ism in Illinois and the general viciousness of Bryan
ism everywhere we have this determination of the
new manufacturers of the South to prevent the estab
lishment in the milling towns of that section of the
Union any of those organizations that have done and
?re doing so much for the benefit of labor.
We have thus from North Carolina in rapid suc
cession two illustrations of the temper and disposition
cf Southern Democracy. First they deprive the negro
of the right to vote and second they deprive the work
ingman of the right to organize labor unions. The
aim is clearly to produce the political suppression of
one race and the industrial servitude of the workers
of both races. ' .
A RECENT dispatch announced that the manu
facturers controlling the mills in Charlotte,
North Carolina, had given notice to their em
ployes that they must cither withdraw from labor
unions or from the mills. The workers were given
until to-day to make up their minds. Unless, there
fore, some respite or concession be granted the work
ers in the cotton mills of that city will wake this
morning to the hard alternative of deserting their
unions or losing their jobs.
* That is an example of the way the Bryanites of the
South deal with labor. They have begun the upbuild
ing of a great manufacturing industry in that section
of the country, and their cotton mills are becoming
strong competitors of those of the North. The suc
cess of the mills is largely based upon cheap labor,
and the Southern manufacturers have evidently deter
mined to keep it cheap. What has been done at
Charlotte will be done elsewhere, if the plan prove
successful.

Chamberlain has not pledged himself to any such
policy as that, but he has been moving steadily toward
it. To him the federation of the British empire has
become what a united South Africa is to Cecil
Rhodes; and if the colonies demand tariff preferences
as a price for similar favors we may see the strange
event of the establishment of a protective British em
pire brought about by a Birmingham manufacturer.
There is but one "Joe" Chamberlain, and it will be
remembered Disraeli predicted he would die a duke.
ures of fiscal reconstruction, giving the wheat, lumber
and fruit of Canada, the wood, wines and minerals of
Australasia, the tea and rice of India, and the products
of South Africa, an advantage over competing goods
from foreign sources, it will amount to a criminal
abandonment of the best fruits of the intertrading
power of the empire."
The estimate that Democrats will gain a Congress
man in this State shows that the writer is not <o
well posted as he claims to be. but nojie the less his
statement should have the effect of putting every Re
publican on his mettle. Republicans are counting on
making gains in New York, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey. California should be among the States where
such gains are given. to the side of Republicanism.
In each and every district let there be made a strong
fight for the Congressional ticket. Let us send to
Washington a solid delegation for McKinley and
prosperity.
"In Minnesota the Republicans are apprehensive of
the loss of a member or two from the Scandinavian
vote, which is strongly opposed to the policy of th^
administration toward Porto Rico and the Philippines.
The Republicans concede the probability of the elec
tion of a Democrat in Wisconsin, while they are not
sure of solid delegations from Michigan and Iowa.
In Ohio. Indiana. Illinois and Missouri both parties
are counting on gains for Congress, with the better
prospect in favor of the Democrats. There is only
one Democrat in the present delegation from Califor
nia, but he is not likely to be so lonesome in the next
House. In the other States of the West there is little
prospect of a change, except in Colorado and Nevada,
in each of which the Democrats now expect to gain a
member."
It is not in the South only, however, that there is
danger. Reports from the East are to the effect that
even in States counted as sure for McKinley, there
are possibilities of losing Congressional districts. A
recent review of the subject, by a writer claiming to
have made an impartial study of the situation from an
independent standpoint, says:
From the Southern States Bryan will get upward
of ioo Congressmen without taking the trouble to
make a contest in a single district.* In the present
delegation from Texas there is one Republican, but a
Democrat will almost certainly succeed him. There
are two Republicans from North Carolina and two
from Tennessee whose chances of re-election are
slight. There are two others from' Kentucky whose
prospects are but little brighter. Here, then, are
seven seats that are likely to be taken from the Repub
lican side and added to the Democratic side in the
South alone.
It is to be borne in mind that the Republican ma
jority by undisputed title in the present Congress was
only thirteen. The settlement of contested elections
resulted in seating enough Republicans to raise the
majority to nineteen. Such a margin of control is
very narrow and the danger of losing it is not to be
overlooked. Bryan may be defeated utterly and yet
his parly may dominate the House of Representatives.
BRYAN is rapidly weakening. If the campaign
were to last two months longer he would hardly
h'avc any following whatever. His own speeches
are killing his chances and offending those who a
month ago had well nigh resolved to vote for him.
The vanishing of Bryan, however, does not imply a
weakening of opposition to Republican principles and
the policies of protection and sound " money. It is
fairly certain that all over the Union a considerable
rumber of old-line Democrats who will vote against
Bryan will, nevertheless, vote for Bryanite candidates
for Congress. Such action will be illogical and a po
litical absurdity, but none the less it will be adopted
by many a Bourbon. Consequently the fight for con
trol of the Hov.se of Representatives is the point of
chief interest in the campaign. Republicans who de
sire a sweeping and decisive victory for their party
and McKinley's administration should be earnest and
vigorous in making the fight for their candidate for
Congress.

San FTancisco Fleet Holds the Clos
ing Cruise of the
Season.
The San Francisco Yacht Club gave the
closing dance of the season, the year and
the century on Saturday nisht at the club
house In Sausalito. Nearly one hundred
members and euests wore present and a.
pleasant time was passed until the whittle
of the ferry-boat summoned the dancera
away.
The last cruise of the season took placo
yesterday. Toward noon a fine breezo
carried the fleet away from tiausalito.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy on the
schooner Ramona setting thÂ« s!gua! tor
Fort Point. On the way out three or four
whales were observed spouting, some of
them coming at times quite nrar to tho
yachts. The San Francisco fleet was ac
companied by the Corinthian sloops Aeo
lus. Truant, Emma. Harpoon ami Eilna
and the yawl Arcturus. The San Fran
cisco fleet comprised the flagship Ramona,
Vice Commodore II. R. SlmpKln-s, yawl
Tramontana. the sloops Siren, Nixie. Cys
nus. Thetis and Surprise and the schooner
Chlspa. After cruising out toward Fort
Point the fleet turned toward the upper
bay, the sloops Cyjrnus, Thetis and Sur
prise dropping anchor in a little Inlet to
the south of Paradise Cove. Here were
anchored the sloops Jessie K. Aloha and.
Thelma of the California Yacht Club.
On the homeward trip the wind waa
very light, most of the yachts having to
send men out In small boats to tow. A3
they neared Sausalito they came Into a
little breeze, which took them to their
moorings. George D. Campbell has taken
the cutter Folly up to the marshes near
Sulsun. where she will t>e during the win
ter. The yachts will soon be stripped of
their canvas and some of them will eo
into the lagoon behind Tiburon. The Cyc

which have been chartered during the
season, will go back to their owners.
the sacks, but he cared not. Two Frisco
diamond scrapers were already under the
Bod, and Sullivan and Rube Levy were on
the third and second bags, respectively.
During this tnnlng the score had been
raised by FVisco from 2â5 to 4 â 5. The
situation was edgy, and it looked as if
Hank's cohorts would repeat their latter
day performances by purloining another
victory. "Sapho" would not rattle yes
terday, so he deliberately sent Heine,
who had his eye with him, to a base and
took his chances with Josh Reilly, who
was next up. Harper grabbed the future
by the forelock. Reilly sint the spheroid
heavenward in McGucken's direction.
When the ball descended "MacG." had
his mits lovingly around It. This made
three dead and the side retired; three men
left on the sacks and the game lost.
This eighth inning was the sauce of the
game. Brockhoff led with a hit, but he
was soon put out of the game when Hilde
brand forced him at second. Schwartz
followed with a hit, and on an error by
Johnson Pabst was put into the running,
all three bags being congested with run
ners. At this point Sullivan slammed a
hard grounder through Courtney to Mc-
Gucken, who acted in slippery style.
When the ball was returned to the dia
mond Hildebrand and Schwartz were
shaking hands on the rubber, while Pabst
was on third base. This Is where Levy's
advisers were et fault. Ancient Rube
bunted the ball just hard enough for his
own safety and the fearful loss oi Pabst's
life at the plate. Krug followed Rube
with the stick, the result of which has al
reauy been told.
In the fourth Jnning, when Pabst and
Levy were on the bags, Heine consider
ately swatted out a double, scoring h!s
fraternal friends. The fourth and the
eighth were Frisco's innings. Outside of
those spells their time was not for shln
lns.
The Millers did their fruitful work in thÂ«Â»
third fifth and sixth inninps. In the third
"Sapho" walked to first, but finished his
bag-coursing on a triple from McCarthy's
bat. A wild throw of Relily'a to first.
when the outs were two, Rave McCarthy
a run. In the fifth inning McCarthv was
guilty of another three-bagger, and he
added another run to the !i?t on McGuek
on's hit. Later on McGuckcn scored on
McHale's PingJe. In the seventh McGuck
en scored again.
In the ninth inning, with two men re
tired, Hildebrand rolled out a two-bagger,
but Schwartz flew to Johnson, who saved
a possibly prolonged game. The score:

The Â»Â»""Â»" and Russian hath athletes
of tlie Oljropio Club have returned to life
after a four months' hibernation. During
that period of time they took on adi
pose, several tons In the aggregate, all of
lvfclch they will cast oft by a process of
quiet, perspirational labor in the new
baths at the Olympic Club.
The formal cpening of the new bath
eyotem was held yesterday morning. On
Saturday evening a few of those who
could \raJt no longer gave an Introduc
tory art. just to try the apparatus. The
â¢word rpread and early the next day the
entire band of "hot-air" athletes was on
haÂ«d In "nature's fitting costume," ready
for their course of training.
And nothing like those baths have ever
been built in the West. With their tiling
end marble they recall pictures of the por
f*ct bathing systems of the ancients.
Over four months of time and (21.000
h&ve been expended in making the baths
at the Olympic Club all that any ablu
tlor.aJ lover could fancy in his drt-ams.
Not to miss any of the conveniences and
facilities offered, the "hot air" exercisers
tried every kind of bath yesterday.
Fred Butz led the revelers. In order to
make up time that was lost ho took no
less than four baths, going the full round
such time. Hutz haa twenty or lifty sur
plus flesh pounds, for which he I'et'ls no
particular affection. "1 guess the*e v.re
bad." was all the grand-jury man -was
heard to pay as he walked Into the hot-air
room, tapping the marble and playing
with the showers. Tom Walsh wanted to
know If cleanliness wasn't brought a
point or two nearer godliness, and this
whole business wasn't a section of heav
en's bath house. Harry V. Ramsdell, a
director of the club, couldn't say a word.
He was lost in rapt admiration and fell
asleep In the steamroom. After being par
lvMled and nearly ablaze with heat. Chief
Sullivanâ the firemanâ played the cold salt
water spray on the director and saved hia
life. Then the crowd looked for Johnny
Hammersmith, who talked so much about
the baths while they were In process of
construction that his Idends say he has
really grown an orator's vocabulary and
the speech of the eloquent. They did not
find him. so he wns fined by the H. A. A.
O. C which mrans Hot Air Annex, Olym
pic Club. This organization passed an or
dinance yesterday that all the ancient
members must try the baths before 11
o'clock this evening.
An order has gone out that all political
discussions should be barred from the
meetings of tlxÂ» H. A. A. O. C. This Is
done out of self-protection, as a dozen or
more candidates of jarring parties are
mpmbers of the organization. What the
new annex wants is complete harmony.
In the near future the Olympic Club will
hold a public reception for a general in
spection of the baths. The H. A. A. O. C.
will be in full attendance, but not in work
ing clothca.
At Union Park yesterday In a close and
exciting course D. Toland's clever sprinter
Pleasant Girl won the deciding run of the
big 112-dog open stake from J. H. Perigo s
old campaigner Controller. Up to the
fifth round the winner had comparatively
easy cours.'ng and beat her opponents
quite handily. Against Silver Wings In
the sixth, however, she had a narrow es
cape from defeat. Silver Wings led and
took the turn. She pressed the hare
closely, but In making a drive she missed
and gave her opponent a chance to get in.
Before she could recover Pleasant Girl
had scored the kill after securing three
turns.
In the final Controller was a decided fa
vorlte, the talent offering 5 to 2 on his
chances. Toland's hound had a good fol
lowing, and In consequence a strong p'av
was made on the result. The Girl led.
but In a mixup Controller held a slight
advantage on clever work, the score fig
uring six to five In his favor, when the
Girl got the kill and won the stake by a
single point.
Master Claire performed well and
reached the sixth round, where he was
beaten pointless by the runner-up.
In the third round Liberator gained the
applause of the crowd by a clever kill.
Rusty Gold, favorite at 5 to 3, was his
opponent, and together they closed in on
the game. In an effort to escape from Its
pursuers the har*Â» leaped high in the air.
and Liberator, following suit, sprang for
It and caught it on the jump, scoring th?
kill.
The short ends made a good showing
and averaged at better than fair odds. In
the second round Master Rocket led Ka
naka and won at 1 to 1: Lowlander. a'J
to 1 favorite, led Moonbright. but was
outworked. Liberator led Sleety Mist by
three lengths and won at 3 to 1. St. Helen
beat Ca?h, who led but was outworked,
at 5 to 3. Beer Brewer, after being led,
outworked Sliver Cloud at 2 to 1. as did
Tyrone Prince to Auckland at the same
odds. Random Aim in a closft race beat
McKinley at 3 to 1. Forest Queen led and
beat Lorina at 2 to 1.
In the third round Rest Assured led and
beat Miss Skyrocket. Sollicking Airs out

and Veto eutworketl Olita. all at 3 to 1.
Echo beat Beer Brewer at 5 to 4. Iowa
Boy outworked Tyrone Prince at 2 to 1.
Favorites won every course in the fourth,
fifth and sixth rounds.
The stake resulted In good coursing
throughout and was witnessed by a large
crowd.

LIVERMORE. Oct. 14.â Mrs. A. G.
Young of Altamont had a narrow escape
from death from the bite of a tarantula
a few tiays ago and was only saved by a
furious ride to Livermore and tbe natural
inclination to thrusting a wounded finger
into the mouth.
Mrs. Young needed a few light chips in
crder to get the fire well started a few
days ago and went to the woodpile to
gather some. While so engaged she felt
a sharp stlr.g on the end of her finger.
With a sharp cry Mr?. Young put the
finger Into her mouth in order to soothe
the pain. It is to this fact that she prob
ably owfs her life.
Mrs. Young was a little curious as to
what had caused the pain. and. taking, a
small stick, she began a search in the
pile of chips and wood. It took hut a few
moments to dig out a tarantula, bristling
with anger and ready for another attack
for the intrusion upon his habitation.
With a proper regard for the poisonous
quality of the bite of a tarantula Mrs.
Young summoned her husband, and they
hastily harnessed a horse and drove rap
idly for Livermore. some miles away. By
the time Mrs. Young arrived in Livermore
her arm had swollen to twice its natural
fizr, and she was suffering great pain.
She at once applied for medical aid, and
after several days' treatment was report
ed out of danger. It is believed that Mrs.
Young extracted much of the poison from
tho wound when she put the finger to her
mouth immediately after the sting of the
insect. The tarantula was captured and
is now preserved in a bottle in the Young
residence.

The Czar's home life is simple, says the
Golden Penny Magazine. He likes plain
food at dinner and he seldom has many
guests at his table. He eats quickly,
"like all men who are accustomed to
work a good deal." and he drinks very
little wine. He drives about In a small
two-horse carriage and he wears a uni
form almost always, for he does not like
civilian attire. Indeeu. it is said that he
had no frock coat until he visited Paris
a few years ago, and that the court
tailor, who was only accustomed to mak
ing his uniforms, was in despair because
he knew that his imperial master would
be obliged to wear civilian's attire in the
Â¦Parisian ceremonies. Being a man of re
sources, however, he went hastily to
Paris to study the latest fashion in men's
dress and he finally purchased a suit for
700 rubles. ThiÂ« suit the Czar wore during
the festivities in Paris and the story goes
that he felt %'cry uncomfortable In it.

Evidently the smooth and obliging prsss
agent isn't appreciated by Franz Josef of
Austria, says the Boston Herald. It is
related that the venerable Emperor re
cently spoke at a political dinner. Ac
cording to his wont, he said a very few
words, and these were poorly expressed,
as he is not a good speaker. Next morn
ing the Emperor, on looking over the
ppper, noticed that "his Majesty had
madÂ© a most impressive and important
speech." and in flowery language followed
the Jiddress he was supposed to have de
livered. The Emperor, turning to one of
his attendants, at-ked. "What does this
mean?" "Sire." replied the attendant sol
emrily, "that is th*> f-peeoh it pleased your
Majesty to deliver last night." "The
speech I delivered!'' returned the Em
peror. "Kindly go to the axa who wrote
this and tell him that I may be an Em
peror, but I am not an orator!"

OAKLAND. Oct. J4.â The winter season
of hold-ups opened In Oakland this even
ing at the corner of Twelfth and Union
streets, where et .9:40 o'clock two foot
pads held up G. Palmer, residing at 525
Thirty-second street, and E. Crowley. who
lives at 1357 Broadway, and relieved them
of their money, amounting to about $S.
As soon as Palmer and Crowley had
been searched by the highwaymen they
were ordered to disappear as rapidly as
possible, under penalty of being shot if
they faltered. The men obeyed instruc
tions, but half a dozen blocks away from
the scene they met a policeman, into
whose ears they poured their tale of woe.
There was nothing extraordinary in the
affair. It was a plain case of highway
robbery. Crowley and Palmer were wait
ing at. the corner for a Twelfth-street
electric car -when two men suddenly ap
peared from the dark shadow of the build
ings. One of the new-comers stepped up
to the waiting men, and, thrusting a pis
tol under their noses, commanded "Hands
up. and be quick about it." Up went two
pairs of arms high In the air.
The pistol-wielder's companion then
proceeded to make a hurried but complete
search of the help-up men's pockets. Tho
search yielded so little that a curse or
two dropped from the raiders' lips, but
the proximity of the pistol warned the
victims to accept the situation without
protest.
The footpads worked rapidly and gave
Palmer and Crowley but lit^-j opportu
nity to see them, standing in the shadow
as much as possible.

In "Lnve's Labor's Lost" we find the
schoolmaster of Shakespeare's youth, as
in another play we have found the dis
guised Sir Thomas Lucy. Lilly's Latin
grammar was evidently one of the text
books used In the Stratford .guild school.
The guild was dissolved about -the year
154S. The school, however, wes continued.
It was re-founded '>y Kdward VI.
Shakespeare certainly read the Latin col
loquies so commonly used in the sixteenth
century. He could not have escaped
them, for the common schools In those
days were I^atln schools. The school
master in "Love's Labor's Lo.Â»t" Is very
Latinized. Indeed. In act 5. scene 1 fThe

It is a delight in Stratford to know- that
the old school and the old church, the
Avon and the tanks of the Avon, are so
little charged. New Place â the glory of
his manhood â is no more; what is left of
its foundations is covered by a -wire
screen, but the things that impressed his
senses when he was young, which come
out unconsciously In his writings, are still
there. One, be it noted, is his revererice
for religion. Living at a time of religious
storm and stress, he does not gibe at the
new form of opinion just cotr.e in or
sneer at the old faith which Englishmen
were discarding. The walls of the guild
school were painted v.-ith rude pictures of
the crossâ "The History of the Cross" the
series was ca.lfM}â and the early plays crr
formed in the town hall were nearly all of
a religious character. The spirit of rever
ence is one of those characteristics which
surprises many o? the critics of Shakes
peare. Because nowhere in his plays does
he indulge in polemics, as Spenser does,
he is accused by some, but r.ot many, of
irrelipion. As if the best guarantee of a
man's piety is that he should sneer at
pome form of religion! To the old religion.
as William Black says, he was ever gen
tle. And one can very well understand
this when one lives in Stratford for a
while and becomes saturated with the
local traditions that still preserve the
color of that elder time of guild schools
and great cathedrals when the Maypole
was reared and the convents were not
"mere ruined choirs In which the sweet
birds pang."
Nearness to nature begets reverence in
high minds. William Shake^ptare was
very nr-ar to nature. Besides, down to
his time there had been no divorce be
tween the myths of the fairies and the
teaching? of faith. Amiable belief in the
little people was not looked on as ac
cursed by the theologian, and that very
plainness of speech which moderns so
much and so unreasonably condemn in
Shakespeare was not regarded by the
pulpit with the horror it occasions" now.
A visit to Stratford, an examination of its
history, and a loving consideration cf the
typical plays of Shakespeare will show
that the reverence of God and for aspira
tions toward Him was the outcome of his
youthful surroundings.
The only flowr of the neighborhood not
mentioned in Shakespeare's works was.
according to a very severe old botanist,
the cowslip. When this exquisite allusion
to that flower was pointed out to him h<*

the footpathway that leads from Sttatford
to Shotteryâ you may go to Stratford to
day to see them all. for even the descend
ants of the Lucys are still at Charlecote.
You will remember that it was for poach
ing among Sir Thomas Lucy's deer that
tradition says Shakespeare was obliged to
flee to London. Charlecote is about five
miles northeast of Stratford. Shakespeare
"took it out" of Sir Thomas by represent
ing him as Justice Shallow and making
sorne puns on his name and the "luces"
(pikes) on his coat of arms.
To the lovers of Shakespeare Stratford
on-Avon must be a delightful placeâone
of those Meccas for which the heart
thirsts and in which it is not disappoint
ed. You may read Shakespeare as a task,
as a necessity of culture, or you may read
and love him until he becomes a veritable
part of your life. In the first case. Strat

study; in the second, it will be the abid

We infer that the schoolmaster at
Stratford In Shakespeare's boyhood wa.1
a pedant, but rot unejenial. When he went
to school, in 1S71. Walter Roche wai the
master; six years later Thomas Hunt -was
appointed. Whether Shakespeare read,
Homer. Seneca or Plautua carefully. It is
certain that the scnoolmaster introduced
them to him. Of a knowledge of Greek
we find no trace in his plays. A3 Sydney
Lee* says:
It is Just pc?Â«iblÂ» that at thÂ» most efilcler.t
country schools the more advanced scholars.
b*forÂ« the passage cf some neighboring: mag
nate or the existence of a colleKe scholarship
enabled them to proceed to the universities.
learnt somethir.e of the Greek grammar. witlÂ»
the Greek te*td:rur.t and Socrates or Demos
thenes. But Shakt>.Â«peare was doubtless with
drawn from school In consequence of hla fath
er's tecuniary misfortunes.
Holofernes may have tx'en partially a
remini.srer.ee of Mr. Roche or Mr. Hunt:
if so, Shakespeare had r.ot an unkindly
remembrance of his schoolmaster*, who
were doubtless severe In their in^dstenc9
on a very pedantic pronunciation â a cor
rective which r.o doubt speakers of the
Warwickshire dialect badly needed.
We all know that the "best influences
on a boy's life are not frora books.
Shal*cspeare's country rambles, his even
| ings by the fireside listening? to tho old;
tales of fairies, of England's giories, of
Guy of Warwick, of the kingmaker, that
other Warwick, of the grewsome doings
of English kings, as seen through the
popular fancy. If the schoolmaster,
through his declensions and conjugations,
trained his mind, the sight3 about Strat
ford trained his imajrir.a.tton. And tha
sounds, too. for Stratford and all Ens
land were places of singing In the tima
of Elizabeth. His was a quick ear, and he
easily caught the cadence of the popular
music. The old Shakespeare house, with,
Its chimnev seats â there are closets for
smoking bacon in itâ may yet be seen.
! Here the boy sat o' winter nights and
roasted the chestnuts he had gathered In,
his precious lesson time, while the crab
apples simmere.l in the bowl. He recalls
the winter nishts in the final song oÂ£
â¢'Love's Labor's Lost":
When icicles hans by thÂ« wall.
And IMek the ?herh<*r-i blows his call.
And Tom bear* logs into the hall.
An'I ir.Hk comes frozen home la pal!.
When blood is niprÂ»-d and ways be foul.
Then nightly *:r.g3 tnÂ« sfarins owl.

Xu-whoo, a merry n. >te.
While greasy Joan duth keel the pot.
WVn all alout! the vtad doth blow.
And ciughlr.R drowns the parson's sa.Tr,
And birds Bit brooding In the Â»now.

V.hen roasted crabs hl?s in thÂ» bowl.

The "daisies pied and the violets bine"
you will find about Stratford In their sea
son. Shakespeare's flora and fauna giva
no shock to the accurate when they are
the flora and fauna of Stratford. ThÂ»
gnarled oak, near the stream, the very
deer on which the melancholy Jacques
meditated, may be seen there to-day aa
they were impressed on the receptive
senses of the little Will. There, too. ars
the peas-Mossom. the reeds by the river
and the "sweet mu3k ros^s" In their sea
son, that Titarla loved. You may find the
"luscious woodbine" and in the spring tr.n
flowers and herbs that Ophelia offered in
her gentle madness, the fennel, the col
umbine, the rue and the rosemary- Ir I*
not hard to find th* very willow and thÂ»
brook which Shakesueare saw many
times and which he pictured forever in,
Ophelia's dying scene:
Therp. with fantastic garlands, A\i she come.
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies and long pur-
Sles.
Ophelia's willow has gone th- way of
the great mulberry tree at New Place.
but there are willows and brooks in War
wickshire that make you understand how
this sad willow and brook looked, if you
need such aid.
No man can escape from his early Im
pressions, and it is fortunate that Shakes
peare lived his early life in the bcautv
and simplicity of Stratford. In nearly
every play of his? 1m goes bark to it In
thought, as ho finally went back to It. not
as one wearv of life, but as one who had
worked in order to enjoy life, bven In,
the plays of Italy he returns to Stratford.
Hamlet lives In Denmark, but Denmark
la Shakespeare's England, and the at
mosphere out of the court is the atmos
phere of Stratford. Navarre of "Lov-'a
Labor'? Lost" is certainly not in Spain,
except in the scene that glve3 u* castlea
In Spain. There are glimpses of Stratford
all through it. And Arden. the fore3t of
"As You Like It." Is replete with the
fragrance of these forest farms about
Stratford, which we know Shakespeare
loved. Permit me to recommend to the
general reader Sydney Lei?'? 'Â¦Stratford
on-Avon." William Winter's "Shakes
peare's England." William Black's "Ju
dith Shakespeare" and the chapter on
Shakespeare in Halleek's "Education of

Sighing Is but another name for oxygen
starvation. The cause of sighing Is most
frequently worry. At Intervals of several
seconds often follows moments of mental
disquietude, during which time the chest
walls remain rigid until the Imperious de
mand is made for oxygen, thus causing
the deep Inhalation, It Is the expiration
following the inspiration that is properly
termed the sigh, and this sigh is simply
an effort of the organism to obtain the
necessary supply of oxygen. The remedy
is to cease worrying. One may be anx
ious, but there is no rational reason for
worrying. A attle philosophy will banish
worry at once. Worry will do no good; it
will rob one of pleasures when blessings
do come, as one will not be In a condition
to enjoy them.â Ladles' Home Journal.

Of all odd schemes I think the student
barber's shop plan is the queerest. I ran
across one in Boston yesterdayâ but never
fear. I did not patronize it. You could get
shaved there by a full-fledged barber for
10 cents; if you had only a nickel -you
could get shaved by a member of the
graduating class; if you did not have as
much as that you could get shaved for 3
cents, for 2 cents, and even for 1 cent by
beginners, according to the grade of their
proticiency. In fact, I noticed that from
the lowest class in barberisrn you could
obtain, not only a shave for 1 cent, but a
shampoo for 1 cent and a haircut for 2
cents. Think of the courage of undergo
ing that ordeal.â Boston Journal

Porterhouse steaks have gone out of
fashion, according to one of the uptown
butchers who supplies meat to a lot of. the
families in the fashionable districts on
Riverside drive and We3t End avenue.
For years and years the porterhouse steak
has been considered the best cut of beef
and has fetched the highest price. Now
the demand is for the Delmonico steak,
which is the porterhouse with the bit of
tenderloin cut out of It. A dislike for
the tasteless bit of tenderloin seems to
have developed unless the tenderloin Is
served separately, either as a roast or
fixed up as one of the fancy steaks that
the accomplished chef knows how to pre
pare. There Is more flavor to the sirloin,
and so the demand Is for either the bone
sirloin, as it is called, or the Delmonico
steak, which follows it in the carving of
a "critter."- This fancy has generally put
out the butchers, who have now to find a
new way to carve their meats to advan
tage. Even when the tenderloin is cut
away from the bone it is said by the
dealers to be the hardest piece of the
beef to now dispose of to advantage. â

"Halt of the people who wear glasses
and complain that their sight Is gradually
diminishing owe the idea to dirty glasses,
remarked an optician. "Spectacles and
eyeglasses are much benefited by a bath
now and then, as people are. It Is strange
how many people there are who think
that by wiping their glasses now and then
they keep them clean. The fact is they
want a bath just as frequently as does a
human being. Tou see, it is this way:
The face, and especially the eyes, all the
time give oft a fine vapor. This clings to
the glasses and the dust collects on them.
As soon as they become dean â that Is,
apparently cleanâ the wearer is satisfied.
So the process goes on. But while wiping
the glasses cleanses them and is neces
sary, a bath is also required. Every time
the glasses are wiped a fine film of dirt
is left on them, and this gradually accum
ulates, and no wiping will clean ft off. In
time this coating gets quite thick enough
to blur the vision, even though at a glance
the glasses may appear clean. When this
occurs the sight Is diminished and they
come to me or some other optician. What
they ought to have done was to give the
glasses a bath in warm water, well scrub
bing them with a small toothbrush and
soap, and afterward wipe them. This
should first be done with chamois leather
and then with tissue paper to polish
them."â Boston Transcript.

For more than sixty years the existence
of the Boers has been the epic of continu
ous and immense adventure, in which
nothing has been so amazing as the last
struggle and the final defeat. There is no
such example of a hard and stubborn peo
ple, dimly led by destiny, in their flight
from civilization, to revolve in a circle
which brought them back at last face to
face with the most overwhelming environ
ment of all theMdeaa and forces of civil
ization, in the shape of the British empire.
When the Dutch farmers resolved upon
their exodus from Cape Coldny and
plunged with their long teams of lumber
ing oxen and cracking wagons into the
wildernesses of the north, wandering over
veldt and mountain, tnrough bush and
river, seeking from decade to decade for
some further home and abiding rest fro"m
their pilgrimage, and fighting their steady
path as a handful against hordes through
a thousand miles of savage continent, the
Boers commenced a story of heroism not
to be equaled out of Exodus. It will never
be adequately described, if not by the pen
of some second De Quinc^y in pages of
such supreme eloquence and power as
those which immortalized the flight of the
Tartars. â London Telegraph.

proved himself worthy of respect and ad

nature, evincing th*Â» utmost pleasure in
the society of superior man and that of
his own race, and assumes the role of a
genial host on occasions with marked
success.

generosity hitherto unsuspected by his

since he was seen trotting busily down
the street in his usual free and airy man
ner; everybody knows him in the place,
partly because of his Interesting person

since his earliest puppyhood, and an ob
server instantly thought something im
portant was on his mind. Presently be

with him a companion of about his .owr
pize, another bulldog, whom he conducted
with much ceremony to a retired spot in
the garden where reposed a- delicious
heap of beef bones. It goes without say
ing that the guest required no special
urging to partake of the Irresistible ban
quet, and he fell to with great gusto,
while his host demonstrated his ability to
sit by and watch the proceeding's, not
only calmly, but with a smiling counte
nance, every atom of his small body
evincing: keen pleasure at the satisfaction
of his friend, who crushed and gnawed
those bones to matter. Xo mean moral
feat that. This done, the little fellow still
further enacted the attentive host by
escorting the stranger to his home. In
view of such facts as these, it seems that
persons who are prone to deny the exist

label it blind instinct, may be obliged to
reconsider the matter."â Boston Herald.

The question of the registration of trade
marks has been taken up also by United
States Consul Freeman at Copenhagen,
who says that in order that an American
firm may get a trade mark registered In
Denmark it is necessary to have the same
registered in the United States.
"A prompt action," says the Consul,
"should be taken by American manu
facturers to prevent the appropriation of
their trade marks by unscrupulous firms."
The Consul General says that the ob
vious course of all American exporters Is
to have their name and trade mark duly
registered in Germany before exporting
any kind of merchandise covered by a
well-known name to that country.
There are other instances of these
fraudulent appropriations, and the abuse
haÂ« become so notorious as to elicit the
remark from a" leading German patent
attorney that "the effect of the law Is to
legalize and facilitate the theft of a
trade mark."'
As an instance of how readily such a
provision can be abused, several years
ago, when American bicycles began to be
Imported into Germany, certain persons
interested in the Berlin bicycle trade got
trade marks of two or three American
makers registered in their own names
and either i obliged the legal American
owners of the trade marks to buy them
offâ in other words, to pay a species of
blackmail â or suffer a loss of trade. ,
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.-A very pecu
liar, provision of the German law for the
registration â¢ of trademarks Is not Infre
quently used to the great and unjust ad
vantage of Americans and other foreign
ers, according to a report to the State .De
partment by Consul General Mason at
Berlin. Under the German statute any
person may register and secure right to
any name or device used as a trade
mark which has not been registered pre
viously in Berlin by some other firm or
person. In other words, the officials be
fore whom the application is brought
make no inquiry to ascertain whether tne
applicant has authorized the proposed
trade mark or has any right to it, but
only concern themselves as to whether
it has been registered in Germany. Tho
latter point settled, it is admitted to
registration without further inquiry.

It may be stated that durlnr the years in
which the course of wages declined the rates
of 1891 and 1892 In many Instances remained
unchanged and In like manner during the la^t
years, In which the general course of wages
has been upward, the wages In these Instances
have not of course responded to the general
rise. In other instances the per cent was no
tably large during the. years of depression,
while during the last two years of the period
the reverse is true and a much larger increase
really took r>lace than that Indicated by the
table. In other words, wages in some Instances
show but little fluctuation, while In other In
stances they are much more sensitive, respond
ing quickly to general "conditions of depression
or activity. The average condition or general
level only 13 shown In the table and while, for
the reasons stated, the fluctuations during the
period have not been so great as popular opin
ion would Indicate, the figures for 1899 and 1^00
show a gratifying average Increase Over the
condition of 1SS1 and 1S92, when wages In gold
were higher than at any period In the history
of the country prior to the present year.

WASHINGTON', Oct. 14.â Carroll D.
Wright, Commissioner of Labor, has
Issued a bulletin giving a summary of
data In a previous, publication on "trusts
and industrial combinations," - showing
the rate of wages in various occupations
for a period extending back -In most cases
from the present year to 1S91.Â« The data
was secured directly from the payrolls of
establishments in all sections of the
country. The information contained per
tains to 143 establishments, representing
twenty-six industries and '192 occupations.
Those items for which data for the whole
period were not given were excluded
from consideration in the summary. All
the data included, except those for min
ing, relate to manufacturing industries,
the data relating to steam railways and
street railways having been excluded
from the industry. 1'ne bulletin says
that while the data from which the table
of wages was prepared does not afford
the basis for a strictly scientific calcu
lation of relative wages, a careful examin
ation of the figures leads to the belief
that they are fairly representative and
undoubtedly approximate verv closely the
actual conditions of the whole country.
The summary shows as follows, the
average wages of 1S91 being taken as a
basis and representing 100: â¢

soon begin at "Washington. The data
gathered comprises careful studies and
measurements of young growth in three
different localities, one In Del Xorte. and
two in Humboldt counties, as well as re

most the entire belt. A large number of
acres were surveyed in the green timber,
and the trees in each counted and meas

the volume and component species of the
average trees in the different locations
and the rate of growth per acre in height,
diameter, etc., will be expressed in tabu

These facts with others about the de

The first explosion was about 9:30 o'clock
and the second an hour and a half later.
Shortly after the second explosion a citi
zen wJio was passing saw two men leave
the office and hurriedly walk down l)o
lores street. They both wore overcoats
and slouch hat?, which were pulled. down
over their eyes, concealing their features.
Captain Seymour is satisfied they are the
same men who have blown open several
s=afes~in this city during the past . ten
days.
The burglars then re-entered the office
and found the door of the safe blown
from its hinges and the "strong box" in
the safe shattered. They found no
money, however, and left the place In dis
gust, taking: the books and papers, evi
dently for spite.
The explosion that followed aroused the
sleeping occupants of the house next door,
and rushing into the street they met one
of the safe-crackers, who on being asked
the cause of the explosion said that the
noise was occasioned by the Wisconsin
firing a ealuts. This explanation ap
peared to satisfy the neighbors and they
retired from the scene.
The men made two attempts at blowing
open the safe before accomplishing their
purpose. They entered the office shortly
after 9 o'clock Saturday night, and after
boring a hole in the door of the safe in
serted a quantity of powder. A fuse was
then placed in the aperture and ignited.

Hutchings denies that he drew a re
volver or that he insulted Livingston in
the manner alleged. He says that he met
Livingston and that the latter persisted in
speaking disrespectfully of Captain Witt
man. Hutchings says he resented this,
and told Livingston he should respect his
superiors. "When Livingston refused to
cease Hutchings became angered and a
dfspute followed. He says they did not
come to blows.'
This report was submitted to Chief Sul
livan, and Hutchings was requeste<t to
give his version of the affair In writing.
Livingston says that in reply Hutchinga
called him a vile name, and told him that
the Information he solicited was none of
his business.
This, according to Livingston's report,
aggravated him, and he started at Hutch
ings with closed fists and demanded an
apologry. Hutchings then drew his re
volver and warned nis opponent that if he
took one step nearer he would blow his
head off.
Livingstqn answered that Hutchings
could think about that at\any place, and
that that was no reasonable explanation
for his presence at that particular cor
ner. He then repeated his question.
j In Livingston's report he states that he
met Hutchings at the corner of Dupont
and Union streets, and was surprised at
finding him In that locality. He says he
asked Hutchings what he was doing there
and received the reply that he was
"thinking."
"Thinking about what?" asked Living
ston.
"Why, I'm thinking about what \ con
dition this little Irishman (meaning Chief
Sullivan) ' is throwing the town in," re
plied Hutchings.

Chief of Police Sullivan is investigating
two reports made by policemen of a row
that occurred betwe.en them at the corner
of Union and Dupont streets early Friday
morning. The policemen are Luke Liv
ingston and Hiram E. Hutchings. The
former accuses the latter of having kept
him at bay with a drawn revolver when
he attempted to make him retract abusive
| language that he used? Hutchings denies
; this in his report, and says that Living
i ston persisted in applying vile epithets to
I Captain ,WIttman, who was not present
and that in resenting this a struggle re
sulted. Both men were in uniform and
on duty at the time the trouble happened,
and the department will probe deep into
the affair and ascertain the true facts. -
Last Friday Livingston appeared before
Captain Wittman and made complaint
that Hutchings had drawn, his gun on
him. The captain requested a written re
port from both men and then turned the
matter over to the Chief. â¢
