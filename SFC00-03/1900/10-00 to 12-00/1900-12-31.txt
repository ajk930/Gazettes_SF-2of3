Repeating his statement that the Ger
mans are preparing for an expedition to
SInganfu in the spring' and also fomenting
trouble In the Yangtse Valley, Dr. Mor
rison says:
In a dispatch dated December 23 Dr.
Morrison sends a long protest against
German harshness, which, he says. Is cre
ating instead of checking disorder. He
accuses the Germans of punishing the In
nocent and the guilty indiscriminately In
order to levy fines for defraying their own
military expenses and to form an excuse
for continued hostile oppression. He also
charges Count von "Waldersee with a
breach ' of faith, on the ground that he
gave Li Hung Chang a map defining the
area of the occupation In the province of
Chill and Indicated the' district beyond
which the allies would not operate, and
yet allowed the German troops to inflict
severe punishment upon the Chinese -at
Tsangchau and Yungchlng, both of which
are outside the area. &9S
"Five expeditions are now operating.
Every report tells of Increasing unrest.
The policy of-rteprivlng the Chinese of all
power to exercise authority is spreading
disorder broadcast and forcing peaceful
Chinese into opposition."
LONDON, Dec. 31.â Wiring to the Times
from Peking yesterday Dr. Morrison
says: "The Chinese have accepted all the
conditions of the Joint note. They are
sending formal acceptance by an envoy,
and ask . that . negotiations should com
mence forthwith and military operations
cease. LI Hung Chang is much better,
although greatly shaken.

astonished at receiving the imperial in
structions. Neither Li Hung Chang nor
Prince Chlng had expected success In
persuading the court under ten days.
The Emperor's lnstiuctlons are to agree
fully to the note, but to endeavor to get
the best terms possible, particularly In the
matter of limiting the number of the lega.
tlon guards and also as to the places
where these are to be located.
The plenipotentiaries are Instructed to
endeavor to limit the number of army
posts along the line of railway to as few
as possible and finally to request tua
powers not to destroy the forts but merely
to disarm them.
Li Hung Chang's health is bad and it is
doubtful whether he will be able to do
more than affix his ..signature' to an in
strument delegating hra powers to Prince
Chlng until another plenipotentiary shall
have been appointed. He was dressed
this morning and' earned In a chair to thu
residence of Prince Ching, with whom he
held a "long 'consultation. Prince Chlng
then called upon the dean of the diplomat
ic corps, the Spanish Minister, Senor de
Cologan, and requested him to notify the
other envoys that instructions had been
received from the Emperor to sign the
note. '
ThÂ« foreign communities in Peking are
satisfied at the decided tone of the col
lective "note and " the assertion that 'the
powers are determined to entertain no

John Smith, an employe of the Schneld

Pat Crowe was positively connected with

LONDON. Dec. SI.â The "War Office !
has received the following dis- |
patch from Lord Kitchener:
-PRETORIA. Dec. 30. 7 p. m â
General Littleton reports that our i
post at Helvetia was captured yesterday
rr.orr.irg by thÂ» Boer?. About fifty were
killed and wounded and 3M taken prison
ers.

Liverpool Regiment. An asking for fur- j
ther information."
Â¦While Lord Kitchener sends Ubrfa bad j
news for England on the closing day of |
the year, the press continues to take a ;
surprisingly hopeful view of a grave sit- !
nation and of revelations of an enormous* i
2y wide field of Boer activity. General \
Dewet is Etill at large. Kimberley is iso- j
lated. The Boers are in force enough to
have captured a strong position at Hel
vetia. In the Lydenburg district, while
judging from lord Kitchener's very re
cent advices no progress is being mfcde
against the Boer Invaders in Cape Colony.
According to further telegraphic advices

five months. The garrison at Ottoshoop ;

there, the ground being particu'arly
&<3aptPd to their methods of warfare."
The Boers admit that In their fight with
Grreral Clements at Nooltgedacht they
lost 130 men.
"It- is understood that Lord Kitchener
cannot ask the colonies officially to send
troops," says a Durban dispatch, dated
December 29. "but he desires It to be
known in Australia and Canada that Aus
tralians and Canadians arriving In Natal
will be eligible for immediate enlistment
In the irregular corps, which is proceed
ing to Johannesburg for five months' ser
vice.** â¢
To emphasize Lord Kitchener's covert
edmisslon that no progress is being made
against the invasion of Cape Colony, a
correspondent at Burghersdorp, wiring
Saturday, reports as follows:
'Two fresh commandos are entering the
Colony. One has already crossed near
Knaapdaar and the arrival of another Is
momentarily expected In the Steynsburg
district. The Boers are said to have two j
or three horses each, though in bad con- !
d'.tion. They have no gnns or transport. |
tat are well supplied with Lee-Mctford |
rifles and ammunition. Captured Boers j
ray that the Intention of these com
mandos Is to roam about and wait until
Dewet appears on the scene."
All dispatches arriving in London agree i
that the Cspe Dutch show no* inclination j
to rise, but. on the contrary, appear to â¢
be tired of the war and desirous of peace.
Many refuse to supply the Boers with
food, and are willing to give Information j
to the British regarding Boer movements. I

Lord Kitchener Reports Fifty Men Killed or Wounded and

The report of Lieutenant Colonel E. A.
Garlington. inspector general, who mada
a careful investigation of the beef ques
tion, sustained General Miles' assertion
that the beef was treated with preserva
tives, and the testimony of officers before
the war commission and court of inquiry
will also be quoted in substantiation of
General Miles', attitude.
Surgeon Daly's delay In submitting his
report to General Miles arose from the
fact that he became ill after returning
from Porto Rico and the necessity of
making a careful . analysis of the beef
which he had secured.
In his reply tc General Alger It Is un
derstood the commanding general of the
army will not hesitate to publish certain
facts which. It Is said, will not be credita
ble to the former Secretary of War. Gen
eral Miles will take up fn detail the
charges of General Alger and make a spe
cific answer to each- With respect to
General Miles' delay In bringing the facts
In connection with the beef furnished to
the troops to the attention of the Secre
tary of War, it Is explained that he did
not care to make serious charges, which
would cause such Indignation throughout
the country, unless he believed the facts
warranted their submission. He therefore
Instituted a qu!et Investigation and gave
consideration to the reports made to him
by subordinate officers. His duty as com
manding general required that he should
take steps for an Investigation as soon as
he became convinced that the Government
had been defrauded and that the troopti
had been compelled to eat nauseating
food, which was responsible for so much
illness. Had he failed to take this action
he would have been derelict and unfaith
ful to the obligations of his position.
General Miles deeply regrets that the
beef controvery has been revived. He re
garded it as closed, his charges in his
opinion having been sustained and the
country having passed final Judgment.
General Miles' action after the Spanish
war In calling attention to the character
of the meats rupplled the a*rmy was not
dictated by any desire to call down public
odium upon General Alger or upon Gen
eral Eagan. In fact, he studiously avoid
ed mentioning their names. He feels that
as a result of the charges then made and
the investigation and publicity which fol
lowed there has been a vast Improvement
in the rations 5upplied the service, with
a corresponding Improvement In the
health o* the soldiers. The beÂ«f packers
are more careful, the Inspection Is better
and the rations of the troops superior to
what it was during the Spanish war. -
General Miles' determination to answer
General Alger Is regretted by his Imme
diate official and personal friends. They
believe that In the interest of the general
and of the array at large be should let
General Alger's charges go without com
ment now, and write a book when he re
tired fully dealing with' the Spanish war
and the beef controversy. General Miles
will not. however, wait so long. He will
commence the preparation of his reply,
and when ready he will make It public.
"As to the statements which Mr. Alger
makes wblch are untrue, I cannot discuss
them. I do not propose to go Into detail*
now. I Intend to answer the article, but
I will do so In my own time. That Is all 1
care to say now."
This Is the answer Lieutenant General
Nelson A. lilies, commanding the army.
consented to make to-day to the charges
of General R. A. Alger In his North Amer

WASHINGTON, Dec 30.â The report
that the Chinese Plenipotentiary had been
directed to sign the joint note is a source
of satisfaction to officials- here, as indi
cating a disposition on the' part of the
Chinese Government to heed the'deslre-of
the, powers that negotiations shall be en
tered'on at once -and the present unsat
isfactory condition 'of affairs terminated."
The Emperor, it, was expected; would'in
struct his agents to obtain the best terms
possible. One of the principal objections
said to have been made by the Chinese
to the location of any great number of
legation guards in Peking is that these
guards would be a menace to the existing
Chinese Government. As had been al
ready stated In , these dispatches, -"" the
United States Government does not de
sire the absolute demolition of the Taku
forts, but simply their dismantlement, so
that ready access of a foreign force to
the Chinese capital would not be pre
vented. ! The demand of the powers in the
note, however, was for the destruction of
the fcrts. The inquiries said to have been
made by the ChinesÂ© Government of thÂ©
envoys, of which inquiries, however, no
official intimation has been received from
Mr. Conger, have been regarded by the
officials of this Government as reasonable,
and because of this more delay than has
occurred was I expected In the court's di
rection- for the signature of. the note.
Nothing has come from Mr.* Conger re
garding the status of r the note since a
cablegram from . him some days ago an
nouncing that It had been presented to
the Chinese. "r^* **VI1lil Ilil
â¢ Mr.- Wu, . the Chinese Minister, is some
.what puzzled as to just .what construction
to place on the Peking dispatch. He has
regarded . the demands 'Â¦'Â¦. conveyed in ; the
joint 'note . as : harsh and - severe and : the
statement that it had . been; signed' caused
him' surprise. He 7 Is inclined to believe
that* in all 'probability what- the Emperor
has agreed .to Is that the Chinese envoys
should discuss . in a friendly ; manner, with
the other, envoys thelterms of the, agree
ment with a view,! as stated in the, Peking
dispatch,'to obtain. the best terms possible

of Emperor's Action.
Washington Not Officially Informed
In Peking. China Is anxious that it shall
be reduced to as small a number as the
powers can be induced to designate.
Cnina regards the American force con
stituting the American legation guard as
altogether too large. It numbers only
1800 men, but the Chinese diplomats here
point out that if each nation maintains
a guard of this strength Peking will be
under the control of a force of 14.000- for
eign' troops. There are now in China
about 100.000 allied. troops.
Ofllcials of the administration Insist
that It is absolutely necessary to main
tain in Peking the force now there, de
claring that the interests of the united
States could not bo. protected with a
smaller number. 'General Chaffee is in
control of a section of Peking, and a few
days ago sent out an expedition to a point
south of the city. Adjutant General Cor
bln denied to-day most emphatically that
this column was in any sense punitive.
There are to be no executions nor inter
ference with Chinese officials and people.
The duty of the column is to rescue some
missionaries and return with them to
Peking.

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 30.â The Rus-

0MeF?a with 1500 recruits for the maritime
provinces. She carries, also, numerous
preeents from the Empress to the Red
Cross Society officials and nurses in' that
rHstrirt.
The company ordered a tug to accom
pany her, but none was available here.
Tugs will be sent from Liverpool to meet
her. There will be considerable anxiety
as to her safety in her present disabled
condition, especially as the weather has
again broken in a high northwest gale.
It was impossible to interview any of
the Lake Megantlc's people, and the com
pany's agents are reticent, but It Is un
derstood that there were indescribable
scenes among the passengers, who are
tald to have howled In despair expecting
that the steamer would founder at any
moment. '
When thÂ© storm moderated Captain
Taylor decided to return to Queenstown.
It was difficult work to steer the big ship,
but she managed to anchor hero without
assistance. Her officers and men were ex
hausted.
To everybody's surprise, the Beaver
Company directed Captain Taylor to take
the Lake Mesrantlc to Liverpool, and ho
proceeded there with all her passengers
and mails, to be transferred to the Lake
Superior, which will leave the Mersey on
Tuesday.

QUEENSTOWN, Dec. 3Lâ The British
Fteamer Lake Megantlc, Captain Taylor,
from Liverpool December 25 and Queens
town December 26 for St. John, returned
to Queenstown yesterday (Sunday) morn
ing after a terrible experience In the gale.
She left Queenstown Wednesday carrying
thÂ© Canadian mails, forty-five saloon and
twenty-eight cabin paBsengrers and about
BOO steerage passengers, principally for
eigners with many Jews among them.
She had reached a point about forty miles
west on Thursday night when she encoun
tered a merciless gale. Behaving splen
didly, she would have got through had
not Â« the steering gear become damaged
badly, placing her in a dangerous position.
The crew worked bravely and rJgged the
hand-gear, and thÂ© vessel was again
broug-ht under control.
Unfortunately the hand-gear also be
came damaged. ThÂ© gale lasted twenty
hours and an Immense sea broke over the
vessel, smashing the booby-hatch and
flooding her between-decks. where the
uteerase passengers were located. It also
washed away the greater portion of the
fittings and did considerable deck damage.
Three lifeboats were smashed. Some of
the crew were seriously injured and one
seaman was killed on deck.
30.â Of especial interest to tha country Is
the forthcoming naval register for . the
year 1901, which is being prepared under
the direction of Rear Admiral Crownln
shleld, chief of thÂ© Bureau of Naviga
tion. It will show thÂ© remarkable growth
of the navy^during the nineteenth cen
tury. From a few olRcers and still fewer
ships the navy has grown to a total of
1838 commissioned officers, 17,500 enlisted
men, 2500 apprentices and 232 ships of all
classes, with 61 under construction. The
new register will also present the name
of an officer bearing the rank of admiral
of thÂ© navy, while the highest grade of
thÂ© navy of 1800 was that of co-mmodorb.
The senior officer of the navy is still Ad
miral George Dewey.
While, compared with the foreign ser
vice, the material of the navy is small,
it has as high a position as the ships of
1800 had established for themselves after
their battles with French and Tripoli
tans.
The battleships in commission number
sevenâ the Alabama, Kearsarge, Ken
tucky, Iowa, Indiana. Massachusetts and
Oregonâ and this number is shortly to be
Increased by the addition of- two other
vessels of this classâ the Wisconsin and
the Illinois.
The armored cruisers number two â the
Brooklyn and the New York.
The protected cruisers .number fourteen
âthe Columbia and Minneapolis, laid up
in ordinary; the Olympia, San Francisco,
Baltimore. Cincinnati. Raleigh and Bos
ton, undergoing reconstruction: the Chi
cago, Philadelphia. Newark. New Orleans,
Albany and Atlanta, in commission.
Lastly, there are the second class bat
tleship Texas, six modem monitors and
many unprotected cruisers, converted
cruisers, torpedo-boat destroyers, torpedo
boats, tups, colliers, training: ships and
receiving ships.

IN a speech before 200 Harvard and
Radcliffe students at his annual
Christmas eve reception. Professor
Charles Eliot Norton declared the
United States to be the worst of all
nations. He said that for the past two
1 Christmases there had been a sad gloom
banging over this country. We have not
been at peace with the world, and we
have not shown good will toward man.
of a thorough knowledge of the teachings of our
Holy Book, combined with loyalty to the prin
ciples of obedience to established rulings, which
shall not be amended except by the best attain
able wisdom of experts. And perhaps we differ
from wme upholders of one form of orthodoxy
in our conception of what constitutes orthodox
Judaism which seems to us to require a per
manent council to record the Interests of our
religion by defining Jewish duty in response to
new conditions, which so frequently arise.
The evil of reform Judaism is that changes
are made frequently by men who do not claim
to be experts. The standard of learning among
the older ministers was very high, but among
the younger ones who have received their He
brew education in this country only the stand
ard Is not so high as it should be. Even lay
men, an trustees of congregations, presume to
Introduce Innovations, and the logical result of
this is that as individuals they carry the prin
ciple of liberty to do as they please into their
home and personal lives. The Jewish features
of orthodoxy are gradually, omitted and sooner
or later nothing Jewish remains.
The necessity of a synod that should be a
permanent body and composed of representa
tives from all parts of the world, sÂ» that Juda
ism in one country will be the same as Juda
ism In another country, becomes apparent when
we. read of the action taken by the eighteenth
council of the Union of American Reformed
Hebrew Congregations, held in Richmond In De
cember of last year. At that session they
adopted resolutions declaring that "the Jews
are not a nation. America Is our ZIon."
Against such * radical departure from the
teachings of Jeramlah we must emphatically
protest, for such gross misrepresentation of
Judaism and its Ideals will mislead many He
brews, as well as many of our neighbors of an
alien faith, by causing them to believe that we
no longer entertain tbe ideal of Jewish nation
ality. Â¦
Dr.. Mendes then dwelt on the fact that
many Jews are content with such divorces
as they can obtain from the civil courts
of the country, the custom of widow*
marrying the brothers of their deceased
husbands and of the intermarriage of
Jews and Gentiles, all of which he de
nounced as being Inimical tn LL# Latcresta
of Judaism. V.
Dr. Mendes spoke of correspondence he
had with Seth Low of thÂ© American Peac-3
Commission to The Hague concerning the
proposed action of the peace conference
in connection with the Geneva Red Cros*
convention. The letter to Seth Low and
another to the President of the United
States were in relation to the substitution
of another emblem than the red cross for
Jewish physicians, surgeens and order
lies, who had conscientious scruples
against wearing what is an emblem asso
ciated with a religion whose doctrines
are antagonistic to their own.
Seth Low replied that the commission
would do what they could to carry th*
idea Into effect and the President replied .
saying the matter had been brought to
the attention of the Secretary of State.
The following resolutions were adopted:
That a committee be 'appointed to form
unions for the purpose of instructing the young
In Enclish. .
That on the eve of all Jewish festivals and
holidays an explanation of the significance of
the same be sent to the Associated Press, to
gether with a request that they, publish, th*
same.
' 'That the executive committee talcs such steps
as they may deem advisable to further Sabbath

That a committee be appointed to communi
cate with the National Government at Wash
ington, asking them to provide chaplains in the
United States Army,, and Navy to minister to
religious Instruction of the , Hebrews in that
branch of the imblic service.
A resolution providing^ for special ser
; vices for the Instruction of <iie young
brought forth a storm of opposition and
the resolution was finally referred to the
executive committee for such action as
they, may deem proper after careful con
sideration. The majoiity of those who
spoke on this resolution were of .the opin
ion that any -special service would tend
to lessen the respect . â¢ which the children
would have for the repular." service ani j
that -In no way could tncy be so effective

death of Mrs. Nora Hammers, who was

Hoff, who has been acquainted with
Mrs. Hammers since July, admits that he

of Hoff. and Mrs. Qrlswell, a sister of the

These two maintain that the woman killed
herself because she feared Hoff, who has
a wife and daughter, intended to cease

Hoff's revolver was found In one of the
dead woman's hands. Hoff claims that
when Mrs. Hammers fired the fatal shot
he picked up the weapon and ran for a

It was the custom of nurses on duty at
night to sleep. If any of the patients

When -he recovered hly senses , he com

"One man was admitted to the ward af

him down the corridor, threw him down

him to keep quiet. At the table he made
some remark and got up to leave. 'What's

was a Russian boy about twenty years
old. He was covered with bruises from
head to foot and his face was a sickening
sight. He was accustomed to sing, as a
result of his mania, and this angered the Â¦
nurses extremely. The head nurse would
come behind him, seize him by the neck,
hit him in the back with his knee and
throw him to the floor, where he would

at Usang, Korea.- Mr.. Hunt was the first
foreigner to obtain mining concessions in
Corea. He went there eight years ago
and obtained an audience with the Empe

The scruples of the Government were
overcome by transferring a- portion of the
capital stock to the Imperial household,
which is receiving a share of the month

Mr. Hunt decided later- that the railroad
was not -then practicable and returned all
their money.

Saturday in the lake in front of Nelson
by Frank P. Graves, a prominent mer
chant, and his son, who were out fishing
in a row boat. They hooked the sea snake
and the way he made tho water foam
around the boat showed his tremendous
power. They tried to pull him in. but he
turned the tables on the two men and
they were nearly thrown out of the boat.
The serpent threw several feet of his
length over the boat and snapped at the
frightened fishermen with the vidousness
of. a mad dog. A tug finally came to
the assistance of the fishermen and tha
big serpent was lassoed and towed Into
town. Now he is on exhibition in a bis
vat of water. His Jaws are very power
ful, and he snaps a cane In two as if
it were a toothpick. No one has yet at
tempted to classify the big snake accord
ing to scientific formula. He is the first
one of the kind seen in this section. HlÂ»
head Is flat, like a black snake, and about
five infches across, and has the general
appearance of a wolfs face. â¢
Two small horns at the top on either
side give the expression of the snake's
face a particularly ugly appearance, and
the set of the mbuth is hideous.- The
mouth extends from the bases of thÂ«

are more than forty teeth. Those of thÂ»
lower jaw are twice as long as the teeth
of the upper. They are set far out and
are sharp and powerful. The exhibit is

Dawson soubrettes are happy once

SanThe discussion as to when a century begins will
now go over as unfinished business, to be taken up
again in 1999. Until that time we can rest.
San Francisco is about the only city of importance
in the country that has made no preparations for a
k-rand celebration of the beginning of a new century
but after all we may have as good a time and as big
an uproar as Â»ny of them.
San Francisco is famous for the manner in which
has paÂ«sed nights chosen by her as incidents of
-ignal interest in her history, but it is safe to say that
she will mark the death of one century and honor
:he birth of another in a way which in its extravagant
enthusiasm will surprise herself.

open for all venturesome comers,. the lessons are cost

by them as best he c?.n. It is therefore a matter" of
passing interest to note that much of the moral of
all Wall street instruction has been embodied in a 1
song and was sung with hilarity by the brokers at
the Christmas eve jinks in the Stock Exchange. The
chorus of the song runs thus:

ONCE more we remind our readers *of th<*
"watch meeting" to be held by the Ameri
can National Red â¢ Cross this evening at
Golden Gate Hall, on Sutter street. Arrangements
have been made by the society for similar meetings
in upward of fifteen thousand cities, towns* and vil
lages in the United States, consequently those whvj
attend will be in sympathetic touch with the grandest
of all demonstrations made in welcome of the twen
tieth century. ,
The meetings are to be held for the purpose of
obtaining contributions to the funds of the society
As has been pointed out, the Red Cross societies in
other countries have received endowments from vari
ous sources which supply them with means for prompt
action whenever an emergency calls for it. The
American National Red Cross has no such endow
ment. When in peace or in war a call is made upon
it in the cause of humanity, to which it is devoted,
funds have first to be raised before help can be given
So long as that condition of affairs lasts the Red
Cross of the -United States will be less fitted than
that of Europe to perform its charitable and humane
work. It is right and fitting that the beginning of
the new century should be marked in this country by
such liberal contributions to the Red Cross fund as
will enable it. to act as swiftly as the emergency de
mands, and to follow with hÂ«lp immediately upon the
occurrence of disaster. Bear the meeting in mind,
and be among those-who watch the old year out an.i
the new century in at Golden Gate Hall under the
banner of the Red Cross and in sympathy with its
work and its aspirations.

For a long time past there have been forebodings
of financial troubles in Great Britain and also in
Germany. These forecasts have undoubtedly had
some effect in preparing the public mind, and 'Conse
quently the evil of the London failures will not bÂ»
so great as would have been the case had they come
Iiyholly unexpected. The disaster will throw gloom
over London, and will cause some anxiety elsewhere,
but will hardly occasion anything like a general panic.

extent dim the bright prospects of the new year. '
The fact that Lord Dufferin has been involved in
the failure of the London and Globe Finance Corpora

"Call no man fortunate until he is dead." No English
man of his time was more successful and more for
tunate through a long series of years kthan Dufferin.
He is the most distinguished of the living Governors
of Canada and of India, in both of which countries
he is honored for his ability and his service; and
moreover as a diplomatist at Constantinople and at
Paris he attained a reputation as high as that gained
by his service in the colonies. Now in his old age
one evil after another falls upon him, and he has to
face the wreck of his fortune as well as of his happi

In San Francisco the century goes out brilliantly.
All kinds of trade report a good movement at profit
able prices, if we except those farm staples which
rre always dull at this time of the year. The export
trade of the port was never better, and the demand
for the northern mining regions and the Orient keeps
the ship* and shippers busy. The domestic distribu
tive trade, too. is active, and the noteworthy develop
ment of the oil fields in different parts of the State
is exercising an indisputable influence on general
business. Money continues plentiful at easy 'rates of
interest and collections have been exceptionally good
t- ver since the Spanish war, now two years and more
in our wake. No complaints are heard from any
quarter of merchandise trade, and our local failure?
are few and generally unimportant. We thus begin
the new year and century in exceptionally good shape,
?nd the weather thus far this season has been such
that there is a general feeling of confidence in the
rtsults of the year 1901.
Wall street, however, as before mentioned, was Hve
i> last week. There was a sharp demand for bonds
and stocks, chiefly for investment, and from this it
was be'ieved that the public had^ again entered the
market as buyers. Continued good bank statement
encouraged the belief that there would be no
stringency in money, and this stimulated speculation.
London bought largely of American securities. The
demand for gilt-edged stocks and bonds for dividends
ha<= heen so keen ever since the election that thÂ«y
have become scarce ?nd buyers are now limited *o
new stocks and second-class bonds. The demand is
still for dividend payers, however.
Business last week was featureless, as was to have
been expected. Thee is never much life to trade
during the closing week or two of the year. There
was nothing new in the staples worthy of remark,
but the feeling is that all ought to do better after the
ti rn of the year. *?'.:/
These figures are gratifying as showing a healthy
condition of spot business, but the record of failures
for 1900 is not as satisfactory. In round numbers
the commercial collapses last year amounted to total
liabilities of $170,000,000. represented by 10,600 fail
ures. In 1899 there were 9393 failures, with liabilities
of $123,132,000. This exhibit shows more failures in
1000 than in 1899, with .$47.ooo,ooo more liabilities.
As the foreign export trade this year has been very
l2rpre and domestic commerce more than good, this
n-arked increase in failures is peculiar. Some ef
fort is being made to explain the inconsistency bn
the ground that there was a boom in 1809 with rising
price?, and a reaction with falling prices in 1000, and
perhaps this view is correct.
THE closing week of the year and of the century
was distinguished by noteworthy activity in
Wall street and an increase of n.g per cent
in the country's bank clearings. New York showed
s gain of 16.2 per cent and Pittsburg one of 11.5
p<r cent, and all the leading cities of the country ex
cept Philadelphia, Baltimore and Minneapolis showed
an increase, something that has not happened fo"
months. The failures were 213, against 220 for the
corresponding week if 1899. *

PERSONAL MENTION.
EVERYBODY Is en the tip-tea ef
expectancy concerning the "cen
tury, ball" that is coming, off at
the Jewett home thin evening.
The wide latitude allowed by thÂ»
invltattons-gueÂ«tÂ» to. come In character
representing some fail or fancy of the
old century or some anticipated wrinkle
of the new yearâ are sure to be productive
of much merriment. I confess lam anx

ner home for the affair, r She Is nothing If
not original, and I have an Idea that on
this occasion ahe will surpass herself.
Then, again. I am nore than curious xXO
see what she will w*ar.
On Christmas nteht Mm. Jewett gave a
deHehtful little dinner that Must bristled
with new. pretty and effective Ideas. Six
teen people sat down to a table that was
beautiful to behold." with its arrangement
of fruit and holly. As the jruests entered
the dining-room they were showered with
fine white confetti, until they looked as
though they had just come in from a
snowstorm. Another surprise was the
string of dolls dangling from the central
chandelier. One wÂ»nt to each guest, and
with them went a dainty present con

A Christmas house party such as you
rpad about In sweU novels Is the kind they
nnd over at "Casa Boyd." the lovely
â¢untry seat of Mr. , and Mrs. Colin M.
Boyd. at Frultvale. on Christmas day
The Boyds are idealentertalnersy Their
Rnests are always frÂ»e to follow their own
sweet will. If they so please, or else they
may enjoy the many good things that are
always arranged for their entertainment.
When I tell you that en Tuesday last they
surpassed even their own high standard,
yon may get a faint Idea of their merry
Christmas. I -think there never was such
a Christmas night. First came the good
cheer, then the dances, in which the fea
ture par excellence was the Virginia reel,
and then the fire. The fire was not a
part of ; the programme, but when all the
excitement was over we all concluded that
it- certainly ended a merry day in just
the proper way.
tt was past 1 when the two and hap
py guests bid each other good night. It
was hardly 4 o'clock when dear Mr. Boyd
was roused from his pleasant dreams by
the cry of' "fire!" In less than five min
utes all the members of the household
were rushing through the smoke-nlled
house to the cellar, where a defective
chimney was causing all the mischief.
Each and every one fell to work with
bucket and hose, and danger was speedily
averted. Then all went back to thÂ«
downy beds and took up. the thread of
interrupted dreams.

time at the Ames vaudeville show on
Thursday night. The performance went
off without a single- hitch, and the actors
covered themselves with lasting glory.

bright, snappy lines and clever situations.
I hear It Is to be done by truly actors,
but I don't believe they will do it one
whit better than did North Ames and
beautiful Norma Preston.
In the midst of all the fun. though.
there was a sweetly sad side to the even-
Ing. We all said "good-by" and "bon
voyage" to Edith and Norma Preston.
They left on Saturday for a trip around
the world, and It will be a few months
before we have them once more with us.

I never saw anything half as pathetic
as was the soldiers' Christmas festival
That is the record made up by the yellow journal
in dealing with' the first number of Porto Ricans en
gaged to work in Hawaii: and now another company
of Porto Ricans are on their way toward this city.
Surely it will be worth while for the public author
ities, the labor unions and all concerned to see to it
that none of Ihem be stopped in this State to bt
either placed as competitors with our* own workers
or else made charges upon public charity. One fake
of that kind is bad enough. Let us not have another.
After a further exposure of the methods of the yel
low jdurnal. the Coast Advocate goes on to say:
"Many times in the past people who could not afford
to give- five cents without imposing hardships upon
their own. have been cajoled into giving five or
more dollars',' to some protege of the yellow journal:
and concludes by saying: "It is time this'incubus
upon the American journalistic world should be called
down. It is nauseating." . . .â¢ *
Commenting upon the action of the yellow faker,
the Coast Advocate "It created a hullabaloo,
stopped the men and women from going to occupa
tions where they could have earned a comfortable
livelihood, and where they' would doubtless be much
better oft" than in the land they left; and now appeals
to the public in well turned phrases to assume the
care of the unfortunates whom its grasping lust for
trade has thrown helpless and penniless among a
strange people, of whose ways and customs they are
intensely ignorant. â¢ 'â¢â¢-.*.â¢ * _ * If this bpmbastes

All such considerations were as nothing, to the yel
low journal. .Having made a fake display of philan
thropy by provoking the Porto Ricans to refuse to
go to Hawaii, it then undertook to make another by
providing work for them. The means by which k
sought to do.that without, expense to itself are shown
by the following, telegram' which it sent to the editor
of the Coast Advocate: -
- SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 18.
That little item of news is a matter of some con
cern to the people of California and particularly to
those employed as workers in our farms and orchards.
Not long ago, as will be well remembered, a number
of Porto Ricans engaged for work in Hawaii were
brought across the continent. From the time it was
known they were 'coming, a yellow journal of this
city began working* up a sensation, charging that the
Porto Ricans were being carried into slavery- By
the exercise of its peculiar tactics it managed to in
duce a good many of the number to break their en
gagement to go to Hawaii, and to stop in this State.
They were without money, without skill in our kind*
of labor and could speak only Portp R^can Spanish.
They thus, became competitors with California labor
and were of necessity compelled to accept any wages
offered. Moreover, ns may be clearly. foreseen, they
are likely to become charges upon the charity of the
communities that receive .them.

SOCIETY: READY FOR SURPRISES AT
JEWETT BALL
The twentieth century will have very different ideijs
from those which have so intensely influenced human
life during the whole of this one. .It promises to b
much more nearly a Christian century than this. It
is therefore one to which all men and all nations can
look forward with hopefulness.,
- We cannot expect men of future ages to have any
greater respect for our science and art than that which
we have for the beginnings of those things in former
centuries; .it is therefore probable that when seen
from a distance our chief characteristic as an epoch
in history will be our -Napoleonic ideals of individual
success. For the whole century we have been living
under the stimulating influence of that marvelous,
man who showed that by talent, tireless energy and'
dauntless courage a man can attain to leadership and
mastery, and gain for himself all the prizes of life.
That example has been inspiring to thousands, and its
benefits to the world have been large, but its influ
ence of it is already waning. Men are coming to
have less regard for individual glory and more fo"
the general welfare. The spirit that found a stern
joy in strenuous competition is giving way to that
nobler one which finds its joy in co-operation and
helpfulness.
Each of these views of the century is in a measure
accurate. Compared with the past, the nineteenth has
been indeed a century of science, of invention, of in
dustrial and commercial expansion, of material im
provement in the conditions of all classes, of a deepeÂ«
and broader sympathy of man for man. and of an in
creasing liberality of thought and Â«entiment. These
noble things, however, are not likely to make any
deep impression upon the minds of people of the
clo?e of the twentieth century. Measured by their at-,
tainments our inventions, science, industry, com
merce, social conditions and liberalisms will hardly
appear much better than those of the eighteenth ap
pear to us. The developments of another hundred
years of endeavor are going to make our marvels
show as very little things. It is great, indeed, for man
within a single century to have passed from the days
of comparatively small sailing vessels beating their
way slowly against. th: winds to these days of mighty
ccean steamers that have converted the Atlantic into
a ferry; but what will the noisy steam-driven, machine
racked, laboriously-going, wave-tossed steamship
appear like to a man in the next century, who looks
down upon it from his swift, quiet, aerial flight, far
above the storms, in an airship?
To us it appears as an era of revolution bringing
about such marvelous changes in government, in
dustry, commerce, science, art and war as to have
virtually created a new social organism; a civilization
the like of which was never before seen or heard of.
To one it wilLappear zs distinctively an age of science
with Darwin as its foiemost man; by another it will
be deemed the century, of humanity with Lincoln as
its type;, a third- will look upon it as the age of ma
terial improvement through the combined forces of
commerce and industry, having its greatest men
among those who have compelled steam and electric
ity to serve human needs and make better the con
ditions of all human homes from cottage to palace; a
fourth may regard it as a century of liberalism in re
ligion, politics and society, the age in which the
human mind has well nigh thrown off all the old
shackles and bandages of ignorance, superstition and
caste, and stands forth with something of that intel
lectual freedom necessary to its dignity and its hap
piness.
THE CLOSING CENTURY.
AS great men are never fully understood by those
who see them nearest, so the great human
movements of any particular century can not
be rightly appraised by the people of that century.
In this as in all things else it is necessary to stand at
a distance from an object of much magnitude to be
able to perceive it in perspective and so obtain an ac
curate view of the relations of its parts to one another
and their comparative proportions. That which is im
mediately in front of the eve and is ever present to
the mind naturally appears larger and greater than
that which ts distant and seldom thought of. Conse
quently the nineteenth century seems to us much
largerÂ»and grander than it will to those who look back
upon it from the distance of a hundred years. ~"

Mns. Emma A. Young, an elderly woman

brought to the Receiving Hospital last
night, suffering from asphyxiation by gas.
When tbe ambulance from the. hospital
reached the house the woman was found
on the back porch of the dwelling, par
tially disrobed. Neighbors, police officers
and a doctor called from the neighborhood
were trying to resuscitate her. Their ef
forts will probably asRifi in causing her
death. Heroic treatment had to be re
ported to at the Receiving Hospital by Dr.
Dray in order to bring her Into anything
like a proper condition for treatment.
' Mrs. Young wa* found in the bathroom
of the residence, a portion of which Is oc
cupied by the woman and her husband,
when the latter returned about 9 o'clock
from & brief outing. The odor of gas per

President Hirsch, In addressing the
meeting, said that It was a matter of con
gratulation that the association assem
bled In so noble an edifice to celebrate
fifty years of charitable' work. He dep
recated the falling off In membership and
income of the association and urged that
radical steps be taken to* remedy the loss.
The wealthier members of the community
could more readily respond to the needs
of the association' than they have been dy

a change In the law by which rich and

The familiar scenes of "Shenandoah, '
with more soldiers, more burning powder,
more horses and more thrills than ever
before, are being played at the Alhambra.
It always was a noisy play, both before
and behind the footlights, but all the
noise Is of the patriotic kind and there
are hundreds of thousands who have been
the better for the sentiment that "Shenan
doah" gives. There was a good audience
last evening to cheer the tattered flag, to
laugh at Sergeant Barkers quaint humor
and to weep for the generals son as he
dictates his last message, and there was
no lack of each .sentiment as the piece
progressed. , ' . .
The play is well cast and well acted.
The ladies are particularly good, the Ger

Scusa is the poseur by preference. Strauss
is ihe unwilling and unconscious poser.
From head to knees he is the Strauss who
graduated as a philisopher: but from the
treacherous knees to the mercurial heels
he is son of old Strauss, who made the
merry magic of the modern waltz and In
whose steps the erstwhile philosopher, by
force of imperious heredity, was com
pelled to follow. A curious combination
of dignity and abandon he is. as. handling
his vlriUn like a rirtuoso. with the upper
half of nim. and* waltzing -with the rest,
he leads his devoted hand. He is well
worth whi!p without the rest, and his
work is unexceptionable. Hail, Strauss,

with a picturesque "Caucasian March" by
the conductor, of irresistible swing, thu

There is ro question that in his own
line Strauss is incomparable. Froth it is,
doubtless, but champagne froth. It is the
coquetry of music, the laughter of lit-;,
the jeweled moment ii;at is here caught
and crystallized. t One can almost see the
fair Yiennes* floating round on her patri
cian tres to its enchanting rhythms or
catch the substantial twat of happy Ger
man h*els in its merry movement. As to
the manner of its playing it is above com
ment. Shading, intonation, ensemble are
perfect, and the orchestra answers as one
man to the baton of the leader.
A brilliant rendering of the Liszt "Hun
garian Rhapsodie," So. 12. perhaps the
most jMctun-scjue number given, opened
the second part <>f th,? programme. With

SÂ«Â«n Leaving Place by Citizen,
Who Has Given ;the Police
a Description of
That a sang of clever crooks is operat
ing in this city is eviaenced by the
numerous burglaries' reported to the po
lice. Scarcely a day passes that one "or
more houses ai*e not entered and valua
ble booty taken. It was thought that by
the arrest of the three Eastern crooks.who
were no cleverly appienended by De
tectives Ryan and O'Dea. house breaking
would temporarily cease; but judging
from the reports of burglaries sent to po
lice headquarters a more more dangerous
gang is at work in the city.
The latest burglary reported to the po
lice was committed Friday night at the
residence of E. C. Downer at 6SB Geary
street. Mr. Downer and his family went
to a theater, and on returning home they
found that the house had been entered
during their absence and a lot of jewelry
taken.
An entrance was effected by prying: open
a rear window with a "jimmy." Among
the property taken was a valuable dia
mond ring which belonged to Mrs. Downer
and whifh she prizta very highly, as it
was an heirloom.
A citizen who was passing at the time
saw two men leaving the house. ,One, he
claims, had a revolver in his hand, as if
ready to shoot the first one that attempt
ed to stop him or his pal. As they walked
down th* street they were Joined by an
other man. who evidently had kept watch
while they were rausackjng the house.
The description given of the house
breaker? tallies exactly with the three
men who have been operating in the
Western Addition, plundering private res
dences and stealing valuable property.
Yesterday a man who answered the de
scription of one of the daring burglars
was arrested, hut as he satisfied the head
of the Detective Department that he was
innocent he was at once released.
It is thought that the same gang entered
a lodging-house at 112 Geary street a few
nights ago and stole a purse of money,
which was in the pocket of a gossamer
and which belonged to a Mrs. Reynolds.
A number of other daring burglaries are
attributed to the gang but for some rea
son the police are strenuously endeavor
ing to suppress them.

To Consolidate Fair Districts.
"WOODLAND, Dec 30.â It is conceded by
all who made, the rounds of the district
fairs this season that Woodland held the
most successful fair - In the State, the
State ' Fair alone - excepted, although the
State appropriation Is only $2100- for two
years. With a view, of getting an In
creased appropriation and thus enabling
the directors to offer larger premiums and
thereby enocuraging representative ex
hibits of all the industrial products of
Yolo County, a movement Is on foot to
so amend the district fair bill that the
Fortieth District will be comprised of
Yolo and Sacramento counties.

Another Fleet Coines In With. Hard
The British schooner Enterprise came
In from sea yesterday for repairs. She
left Victoria, B. C, on a sealing cruise,
but during a heavy gale off the Vancou
ver coast had her decks swept, . boats
smashed, cabin flooded and other damage
done. '
The barkentlne Monitor had an unevent
ful trip, but the bark Theobald, 32 days
from Port Blakeley, caught it on Decem
ber 21. She was in a terrific south-south
east gale and a mountainous sea running-.
The vessel labored a great deal, and fin
ally Captain Henderson put her about and
ran before It.
The echooner Jennie Stella, 24 .days from
Grays Harbor,- came, near going down
on December 16. She was â¢ swept by the
waves again and again, and the ' rudder
was damaged. In order to save '.the crew
and the vessel 100,000 feet of lumber had
to be Jettisoned. This lightened her up
considerably and she rode out; the sale.
Still yesterday eJfce looked like a featured
wreck, and It will be several weeks before
she Is ready for sea again.
Bell Buoy Shifted.
The steam schooner Mandalay, which ar
rived from Coquille River yesterday, re
ports that the bell buoy at Crescent City

A PARTY TO THE SUIT
Disclaims Connection 'With. Attempt
of Tax Deputies to Restrain
Civil Service Board.
Harry Baehr, cashier in the License Of
fice, is not to be a party to the suit which,
is to be brought by some of the deputies
In the Tax Office against the Civil Service
Commission to restrain It from certifying:
the names of eligiblea for positions as dep
uties in the Tax Office. Baehr'a name
was published* ii an article outlining tho
suit proposed to be brought.
Baehr eays that the reason he did not
take the civil service examination was
because his position is not classed as a
deputy, but as cashier. While the char
ter provides for but one cashier tn tha
Tax Colector's office, now held by O3car
Curtaz, Baehr has been advised that as
a cashier is absolutely necessary for the
License Office, his place will be exempted
from civil service provisions. Baehr says
he has never been present at the confer
ences of the deputies and has at no tlma
been desirous of attacking the Civil Ser
vice Commission in any manner. Â»

double laurels to tho record of Emin
Pasha by beating the get of St. Lawrence,
whose name stands second as a winning
sire.
While the winner of yesterday's stake
worked his way to first place by good go

performances, it was well for him. that
the hare did not stand ionger. When the
game escaped Ireland had about exhaust
ed his chances and Honesty was In gool
6hape to pile up. a. few more points. The
hare, by the way, was, the now celebrated
Gazabo. He seemed to know Just what
was expected of him in a deciding course
and after having given the- dogs a hard
run got far enough ahead of them to
make a safe exit at bis favrrite escape
door.
Emln Pasha closes the season with his
whelps of 1S98â Palo Alto Little Sister,
Reannex, Bona Fide, Lady Granard and
Irelandâ annexing stakes which put him

the turn, followed it out and killed.

end. After taking: the decision from Mas

Opening of a New Track
Will Be the Cause of
the Trouble.
ST. LOUIS. Dec- 30.â Racing will b-s re
sumed at the St. Louis Fair Ground? on
May 11, to continue for ninety days, the
limit fixed by the Mlssouir Breeders' law
for any single track. [ Although the Turf
Congress permits the St. Louis course to
open on April 1, tne State law does not.
It fixes the opening of the season oa April
15, and the close on November 1. Between
April 15 and May 15, when the Fair
Grounds opens, it is considered likely
that Klnlcch Park will have a season of
twenty-three days. If the Tilles-Adler-
Cella syndicate track is completed by the
end of the Fair Grounds season and the
Klnloch people seek to resume at that
time, a fight between it and the syndicate
would undoubtedly result.

Australian Election.
Australia is to hold her first federal
election this year, and the old party divi
sions of the several colonies do not ex
actly meet the new conditions ushered In
by the consolidation*. For example, fed
eration destroyed the free trade move
ment of New South Wales, for the need
of revenue renders a tariff a matter of
course. The various free trade elements
have accordingly made common caose
with the tariff- for-revenue school, to pre
sent a solid front to the protection advo
cates. Though this is the leading issue
in the Impending election. It will not cut
much of a figure. In time, no doubt, the
federation will call Into existence strong
national parties with well-defined pro
grammes and policies. There Is room for
such under* the 'constitution recently
adopted and ther-scoto* of activity assign
ed to the Federal Government. But -the
first election viJi be somewhat chaotic.â

peare had crossed the Thames and tried
his fortune as an actor and playwright In
the theaters of the Bankslde. Of this fa
vorite playground of the Londoners In
Shakespeare's day a word must now be
said.
London In Shakespeare's time was a
long, narrow city drawn out along the,
northern bank of the Thames. The river,
flowing crystal clear, covered with swans
and spanned only by the famous London
bridge, was easily reached by a short
walk from any part of the city, and
served as a public highway and the chief
means of communication between district
and district. The public carriers of the
day were the watermen, as they were
called, an almost Incredible number of
whom, estimated In 1S13 at 40.000. piled
their trade along the stream. Their most
profitable occupation was transporting the
crowds of pleasure-seekers across the
Thames to the Surrey side. That district
was verv dlffernt from the grimy, crowd
ed suburb of to-day. Beyond the little
cluster of houses at the end of London
hridge. known as Southwark. and already
in Shakespeare's day Incorporated with
London proper, a thin line of buildings
ran westward along the> Thames, and thÂ«n
came the gardens and the green fields.
Hither the Londoners nocked on Bandaya
and holidays for a ramble In th* country.
a trial of skill In archery at the butts or
the more exciting sports of ball or bear
baiting. Plays too. were frequent on the.
Surre/ side. Before the suburb pused
under the control of the London antnori
ties they were given In the Inns of Sotrtb
wark. afterward in the taverns of re
moter suburbs, especially those of tit*
strip along the river called thÂ« BaaJc
slde, or the Liberty of the Clink. About
the year 1587 It entered li.to thÂ© mind or
Philip Henslowe. dyer, lumber merchant
and money-lender, to build a playhouse In
this district and thus divert Into Ms own
capacious pockets some of tno goMen
streams that flowed so freely there. For
some reason the building of this theater,
the Rose, seems to have been deferred till
about 1592. but In the meantime Henslow*
had undertaken, perhaps tha construction,
certainly the management, of a theater
not far away, beside' the old archery
ground. Kewlngton Butts. At these two
theaters Shakespeare made bis debut as
a skillful reviser of old plays and an orig
inal author of the highest drawing power.
In 1591 Henslowe seems to have leased his
theater at Xewlngton Butts to Burba**
and his m?n. and here In March of that
year a "King Henry VI." probab.y
Shakespeare's re-vision of an old chronl-"
cle play, was given to crowded houses.
Ten thousand spectators at least are said
to have seen.'ts performance, and when
we consider the very limited capacity o<
the early theaters we can guess how fre
quently this play must have been given.
Some years later we find an entry In
Henslowe's diary of another- play of
Shakespeare's, again apparently a revi
sion of an old favorite, "Titus Andronl
ous." whose performance at Newlnrton
Butts brought In the largest sum received
for a long tim* by the worthy manager.
Among the other plays produced about
this time at one or the other of theae
theaters were a "Lear." a "Hamlet" and
a "Taming of the Shrew"; all three crude
performances enough but of Immense Im
portance to English literature, since they
suggested to Shakespeare the glorious
dramas which now bear those names.

plays within the city limits. It was not
altogether a puritanic hatred of art an<l
pleasure that prompted the Mayor and
Aldermen to such a step. The public per
formances of the plavers undoubtedly
drew together the most disorderly ele
ments in the city. Pickpockets riled the;
profession In the crowded vard. courte
sans thronged the galleries and the wild
apprentices of London not Infrequently
stormed the stage itself. Worst of all.
the plague hung like a pall over the city.
Its cause unknown, but Its effects too
terribly seen In the closed houses andÂ«the
swollen death list. And the plague waÂ«
thought to have an Intimate connection
with the performances of plavs. As a
preacher of the day aptly put It: "The
cause of plagues is sinne; and the cause
of sinne are plays; therefore the cause of
plagues are plays. Quldquld est cauw*
cnusae est causa causati." No doubt In
plague timeâ and there were five great
epidemics In London, not to speak of
minor attacks during Shakespeare's llfo
â the.conco'jrse of people at the plays con
tributed to the spread of Infection: one
of the first precautions taken on an out
burst of th& pestilence was to suppress
not only plays hut all similar public as
semblies until the death rate had fallen
again below a certati; mark. But the
grave nvxgistrates of the city deMre-1
something more than the mere restriction
of dramatic performances. To nlay In
plague time, they argued. Is to increase
the plague by Infection: io play out or
plague time 1Â» to draw the plague by of
fending God. Ergo, plays should never b^
performed at all. Hence the order of 137i
prohibiting all public performances of the
drama within the walls of London.
The Theater.
But the pleasure-loving Londoners were
by.no means ready to abandon their fav
orite amusement at the bidding of city
magistrate Â¦Â¦ or Puritan preacher. Plays
they would have. If not within the clty
then just across the line; and an oppor
tunity was soon afforded them of seeJng
plays in a better fashion than ever be
fore. James Burbage. a quick-witted and
versatile man. an actor In Lord Leicest
er's company and the proprietor of a tav
ern and livery stable outside of the city
wall's, conceived the original Idea of build
ing a house which whould be devoted
wholly to popular amusements â tumbling,
rope-dancing, fencing and plays. He se
cured trie lease of a bit of ground opening
on Flnsbury fields, half a mile or <o
north of the city wall, borrowed sufficient
money from his father-in-law, and In 1576
built the "Theater" himself, being, among
his other occupations, a joiner or carpen
ter Here for the first time an admission
fee was charged: the old appeal to thÂ»
liberality of the audience was abandoned
in favor of this surer and more profitable
method. A certain system of profit-sharing
between the owner of the theater on the
one hand and the actors on the other was
adopted along with this innovation. With
our scanty knowledge of details It Is lm
cosslble to define this system exactly, but
we know that all the great Elizabethan
actors made handsome -fortunes â n fact
which could be predicated of no Elizabeth
an poet as such. â¢
In Burbage'a company, variously known
as Lord- Leicester's. Lord Strange's and
the Lord Chamberlain's men, we find to
ward the close, of 1594 the name lot William
Shakespeare. /His mode of entrance to the
company is probably explained by the old
tradition that he began life In London by
holding horses In front of a theater.
Shakespeare must have ridden up to Lon
don, and his first step on arriving at the
city would have been to sell his horse. He
may very well have disposed of It to Bur
bage the Inn keeper and. liveryman, and.
when the money was spent, have accepted
an offer. from Burbage. In his capacity of
theater-owner, to look after the horses on
which the gentleman patrons of his play
house rode through the fields to Its dOor.
The step from holding horses without to
waiting on actors within was H?robably
soon made. Shakespeare's gentle man
ner* ready *it and adaptability must
soon' have attracted their notice. He
joined the company.' tradition tells us. as
a "servitor." perhaps a prompter's attend
ant or call-boy; -but wtthin a few years
we find him a leading member of the com
pany playing with Richard Burbage. son
of James and the greatest tragedian of his ,
dav and" Kemp, the famous clown, before
Que'en Elizabeth, at -Greenwich. Some at
least of Shakespeare's. early plays must
have been brought out at the Theater, but
we have no record of the fact. Two plays
we know were given there that must have
been- of great Interest to himâ the old
"Hamlet," on which 'he was to found the
most wonderful of all tragedies, snd the
superb play of "Dr. Faustus" by Shakes
peare's predecessor and master in tragedy,
Christopher Marlowe. gBjMa
Close to the -Theater stood the Curtain,
the second of the English theaters. It is
mentloned : as 'early as 1577. but when or
by whom it was built we do not know.

"The knowledge of how to work in the
name of God for the good of man is the
ideal of the religion of the future. It Is
not a new aim or object. It has been the
purpose of Judaism all through the cen

they will blot out injustice. Intolerance
and Iniquity. Judaism will be In the fore

as an epoch, and if Judaism has a mes

centuries of old."
"Israfrl" (Klng> was rendered bv Clem
ent Rowlands. Then Rabbi Jacob Voor
panger of the Temple Emanu-EI, San
Francisco, preached the sermon, from
Exodus, 3clll:13. He said:
"All cerrmonlal is dry rot unless the
rabbi teaches his congregation the Illu
minating strength of the symbol. The
Ideals of Judaism are not straw men, to
be threshed out In the pulpit; they are not
distant on the mountain tops; they are
not worth a snap of your finger unless
they begin among men and women right
here under them. I will not glorify the
achievements of the twentieth century un
less they begin here to-day. Never mind
about patting each other on the back
over Ideals. They have no value in the
orthodox or the liberal point of view un
less that polnt'of view Is among us now.
Dpople of the First Hebrew congregation,
you must resolve that there Is something
In Judaism to keep, or let us dissolve and
adjourn.
"It Is the fault of the Jews themselves.
They have been glorifying the future and
'forgetting the needs of the hour. We can
not discharge all of the duties of religion,
but we each can do something. Let re

THE TWO UPPER PICTURES ARE OF THE FIRST AND PRESENT
PASTORS RESPECTIVELY OF THE FIRST HEBREW CONGREGA
TION OF OAKLAND. "vt : 'v; ," ' '^ a â¢
OAKLAND, Dec. 30.â Amid a syna
gogue's brilliant decorations the
songs of Israel and the eloquent
words of learned rabbis mingled
to-day in celebration of the First
Hebrew Congregation's twenty-fifth anni
versary. The silver jubilee of the pioneer
Jewish church of Oakland was attended
with ceremonial and worship that called
out the attendance of hundreds of fol
lowers of the faith. The congregation's
ample and elaborate arrangements for
the festival were marked by the superb
programme of music that â¢ vied w".th the
strong appeals from the rabbis to awaken
and quicken the hearers In their adher-.
ence to the faith of their fatherSV
The exercises were begun promptly at
2 o'clock this afternoon. The synagogue,
with its symbolical lights glowing from
masses of ferns and evergreens and glis
tening upon the golden fringed adorn
ments of altar and candelabra, was a
beautiful picture of religious setting.
With Mendelssohn's orchestral "March
of the Priests" (Athalie) for accompani
ment the rabbis and the church officials
took their places at the altar. Then the
greeting of choir, organ and orchestra In
Psalm cxviii. was rendered. After that
came the invocation by Rabbi Isidor My
ers of San Francisco. James Coleman
gave a 'cello solo and a solemn Mincha
service was read by E. Bernstein, the ven
erable secretary of the congregation.
Bpohr's Forty-second Psalm was
chanted by the choir with Miss Mary
Chester Williams as soloist.
Rabbi Nieto's Greeting.
Rabbi Jacob Nieto of Congregation
Sherith Israel. San Francisco, in his greet
ing from sister congregations said:
"It seems fit and proper that I should
be selected to greet this congregation on
this auspicious occasion, because a for
mer rabbi of Congregation Sherith Israel
was the one that consecrated this syna
gogue to God, and Sherith Israel was the
first to offer assistance and to hold out
Its hands twenty-five years ago to the
struggling men of the faith who founded
this synagogue. This congregation is to
be congratulated upon its growth,
progress made despite the small
population and desplts little fac
tional differences and despite its uphill
traveling this quarter of a century. If
sister congregations greet you they have
reason to be proud that your members
have been true to the faith. Oakland has
been an example in a great many ways
for other congregations. In greeting you
to-day I say look well to the future gen
erations, strengthen the youth In the
faith, that it may not be one of the lips
alone, but that actions as well may carry
the name of Jew proudly forward In the
vanguard of progress."
Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus" was sung
by the choir, and Rabbi M. Friedlander;
pastor of the First Hebrew Congregation,
gave a brief history of the organization
during Its twenty-five years of life. He
paid that men in Judaism, like Nathan
Rosenberg, Jacob Letter, Rabbi Levy,
David S. Hlrechberg, Abraham Jonas,
Max Mareuse. Sol Kahn, George Samuels,
George Mersbacher, E. Bernstein, Jacob
Rosenberg and many others, had been the
firm supporters and upbuilders of the con
gregation. He dwelt upon the differences
and troubles which arose about the
adoption of the reformed ritual, and de
clared that the story of twenty-five years
was the story of a struggle.
Continuing Rabbi Frledlander said:
"We want a presentable position in the
community. We want in the service of
God all the brothers of our faith.- We
cannot have these unless we? are united.
If that be accomplished we shall stand as
one of the leading congregations of the
country. The great need !s to fill the
membership roll of our congregation. The
reason you have not orthodoxy is because
the -women want to dress and be among
the people of to-day, that our men want
to live, that wo want culture. Influence
and education. How long are we to mourn
over the old forms and symbols, when
we should be bringing the young genera
tion into our congregation? Do not look
at the past and say we are going down
ward. Our mission at the beginning of
the new century is to build, so that our
children and our children's children shall
be of us and with us."
First Pastor's Kind Words.
A/ter an interlude, "Alma Virgo"
(Hummel), sung by Miss Mary Chester
Williams, with full choir, organ and ori
chestral accompaniment. Rabbi M. S.
Levy of Ban Francisco, first pastor of the
church, delivered an address upon "The
Religion of the Future." He said:
VIn listening to the appeal of your
rabbi, who has wen fit to designate m<s
as the father of this congregation. I feel
that none could have a better right than

When Shakespeare came to London in
15S6 he found the first regular theaters,
or, as the Elizabeth-ins called them,
playhouses, already established. Com
panies of professional actors, Indeed, had
been in existence for over a century.
Richard III, while Duke of Gloster. i=Â»
known to have had a troupe' of actors in
his play; his successor had two distinct
companies, and with *he beginning of the
sixteenth 'century it became common 'or
noble natrons' of art and letters to lend
the authority of their names to fellow
ships of players and thus rescue them
from the 'clutches of the law, which
threatened unlicensed players with flog
ging and imprisonment as "sturdy rogues
and vagabonds." For a long time, how
ever, these companies were content to
confine themselves to performances 'n
private houses and to such public shows
as could be given in the courtyard of an
inn. Indeed, the court of the old English
inn, with Its paved yard open to the sky
and its surrounding galleries, was the
first home of the popuiar romantic drama
and the model of the earliest English
theaters.
It was not only on their travels through
the provinces that the actors made use of
these Inn courtyards. Even in London
as late as 1575 all public dramatic perform
ances appear to have been given Jn such
places, and the names of several of these
inns have been preserved for us â the Crois*
Keys in Gracious street, the Bull in Blsh
opgate street and the Bell Savage on Lud
gate Hill. But in that year the growing
hostility of the municipal authorities
came. to a head In an order forbidding all
well as at the Theater: and here his first
original tragedy, "Romeo and Juliet."
came out and took the town by storm.
Here at Shakespeare's intercession Ben
Jonson's first comedy of manners. "Every
Man In His Humor." was produced, and
It was here, probably, rather than at the
Globe, as is usually stated, that Shakes
peare crowned his "Histories" with ttte
heroic play of "Henry V." apologizing to
the spectators for his boldness In dar
ing to bring forth so-great an object "on
this unworthy scaffold."
Blackfriars Theater.
There was yet another theater In Lon
don at which Shakespeare played and In
which he had a certain financial interest.
This was the Blackfralrs Theater. It
seems to have been built by Burbaxa
about the year 1598. when his lease of the
ground on which the Theater stofid was
threatened. His establishment of a new
playhouse on the northern bank of the
Thames in the center of a most aristo
cratic quarter was at once at anchor to
windward and a thorn In the side of his
enemies, the civic authorities. For al
though the Blackfriars district lay within
the walls of London, it was a "Liberty."
preserving from the time when It had
been the domain of a great monastery a
certain Independence of the city govern
ment. The playhouse erected there by
Burbage was soon leased out to a chil
dren's company, composed of the boys
who sang in the Royal Chapel, and it
soon became the most fashionable the
ater in London. It is spoken of as a pri
vate theater, and was smaller but more
commodious than the large public play
houses: completely roofed over, with seats
in the pit and on the stage, as well as
In the galleries and in the "rooms," or

A discharged soldier's unpaid debt for

may result in the arrest of the limb of
the law itself. F. I,. Heywood of 119

busied himself paying debts that he had
been able to contract on the strength of
giving two prices for the goods purchased.
Saturday night when he fell afoul of the
law as represented by Felix Dutran,
deputy Sheriff, he had just $2 50 left of the
$159 P2. Hi? arrest was due to his light
hearted, Filipino way of answering
"Manana" to the repeated attempts of one
creditor to collect $52 50 due for goods
purchased.
Chapman admits that he bought cloth
ing to that amount of Brick & Co.. a firm
of soldiers' outfitters doing business on
Greenwich street. He also admits that
one of the firm was on watch for him at
the foot of the elevator in the Phelan
building Wednesday when he came down
from the paymaster's office with $159 92
jingling in his pocket.
"I told him," Chapman said last.nlght.
"that I would come out and pay the bill.
He wanted me to go right along with him,
but I told him I didn't need a guide.
Then Friday 1 found that they were
watching me for fear I was going to leave
for Tennessee without paying them, and
I decided to let them get the money as
best they could."
"They got the money." and their way
was a rather good way so far as effec
tiveness was concerned, though the forms
of the law were somewhat strained.
Chapman has a friend In F. L. Heywood.
who Is an outside salesman for the Golden
Gate Tailoring Company. Heywood Bays
that Chapman did him many good turns
during his business dealings with the sol
diers. Heywood was dining the hero of
two wars at his home, 119 Ninth street,
Saturday night, when the deputy Sheriff
and an ex-soldler named Thompson, who
is working for Brick & Co., pushed the
door open and entered, and after some
words between Dugan and Heywood,
Chapman was arrested on a warrant
charging him with embezzlement. The
deputy Sheriff took him to the police sta
tion at the City Hall, and then started
with him on a hunt for a Justice of the
Peace to fix ball. Justice of the Peace
Dunne was not at home, but Justice of the
Peace Cook was, and he accommodatingly
fixed cash bail at (100.
- Heywood started out to tÂ»*cure that
amount, but finally loaned Chapman J45.
and the latter added to it his J2 50 and
paid over the $47 BO and was given a re
ceipt In full and released . from custody.
"Dugan forced his way Into my rooms,"
Heywood said last night, "without any
explanation of "his being- an officer or hav
ing a warrant. He said he had come for
Chapman and was going to have him.
and he emphasized what he said with
oaths. I told him my wife was present
and I would not allow him to Insult her.
I ordered him to show his authority or
get out, and was going to put him out
when my wife interfered, and Chapman
said he would go along. Dugan had no
right to come into my house after dark
to serve the warrant, and his behavior
was most Insulting. I shall certainly
Fwear to a complaint in the morning and
cause his arrest.
"Dugan and Thompson both kept urging
Chapman to raise the money in some
way, so that he would not have to go
to JalL Finally I agreed to let him have
$45, and he has telegraphed to friends In
Tennessee for money."
Deputy Sheriff Dugan denies that ha
used profane language In the Heywood
home. He asserts that he trampled on
no one's rights In the discharge of his
duty, and that he will have no trouble
in proving his innocence if he shall be
arrested. ' * i: t; ' ' '

OAKLAND LOSES
ONE TAX SUIT
Supreme Court Holds That
an Increase Was
Illegal
First Final Decision From the Su
, prenie Court Upon a I/ong Line
\ of Railroad Tax
Suits.
\ Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Uroadway. Dec. 30.
Thn- city of Oakland has finally lost the
Srst fof a series of railroad tax suits that
havo\bff>n on a snaill'ke progress through
thp courts for half a dozen years. Th^
:;rst Oectaloa that has tome from the Su
preme/ Court is in ihe case of the rail
road raise that waÂ« nude in ISM when the
upsoFPnfcent upon the Central and South
era Pacific Railroad companies was near
ly fioublVd under the then existing anii
reilroad sentiment.
In thav year the railroad was in deeo
trouble. The water front seizure had
fust been made, ordinances were before
the Council reg-ulating the speed of the
trains running througa the city, taking
:hÂ© p&.tes off the local trains, putting flag
men en all street crossing, and when it
c-ame to the taxes of jUie corporation the
City Council, sitting as a Board oi Equal
ization, raised the assessment of the rail
road a considerable figure over the return
na4f by the County Assessor.
The speed onUnance was modified and Is
now in force as modified. Mayer Pardee
vetoed the ordinance removing the gates
from the local trains. Flagmen were or
dered on the important crossings and they
have been cf great benefit to the travel
ing public and have prevented many an
accident. The water f*ont suits have not
yet been finally settled as to street open
lnÂ». though practically settled as to the
rrenerai title of the wa.ter front lands.
Now the emit over the taxes of the cor
poration has been settled by the Suprem-
Court. The corporation pleaded that the
method of procedure laid down by the
itw iiad cot been followed by tfce Board
cf Exroa21Â«atlon In making the increase.
Instead of dtlnjr the railroad properly
and taking testimony upon the value of
the property the Supreme Court holds
th*t the !ncre&Â«e was made arbitrarily
asd without the proper process and test!

DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
COMMITTEE TO STAND
J. G. Johnson, Chairman of the Body,
Says There Will Be No Re
organization.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 30.â J. G. Johnson,
chairman of the executive committee f of
the National Democratic Committee,
passed through Kansas City from Chi
cago en route to his home in Kansas. He
said:
"I am not In a position to say what will
be done toward maintaining the Demo
cratic organization perfected during the
last campaign, but! will say that there
will be no reorganization of the national
committee. Tfce committee is organized
until 1904. and: will remain practically as
it is until that time. I believe that the
present precinct organization can . be
maintained ' and made entirely self-sup
porting."

inches of snow had fallen during the

Currlgaa to-day was perhaps the largest

conducted by Father Duffy at the Church
of the Sacred Heart, after which Rev.

LONDON, Ky., Dec. 30.â Four men have

while two other Clay County men were
killed and two wounded in a flaht Just

Winona Quarantine Raised.
ST. PAUL.. Dec- SO.â This local Health
Commissioner, satisfied that ; the new
Health. Board, formed at Wlnona, has
taken proper measures to guard against
the spread of smallpox said to exist there,
has raised the .quarantine between the
twocities. .
WICHITA, Kaa., Deo. SO.-Mrs. Carrie
Nation; "" the Woman's . Christian Temper
ance Union "joint wrecker,'' has refused
the bail obtained by her co-workers. She
now says that under no circumstances
will she step out of jail until cleared of
the charge against her, and the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union committee,
which had taken up the matter, has prac
tically abandoned its efforts to obtain
her release. V .'Â¦"â¢
The County Attorney, it is â¢aidris se
riously considering a suggestion made by
the saloon man_to withdraw the charge
of xnalicio-us destruction of property and
prefer one of insanity against her., There
is no doubt in their minds that' they can
hold her upon the present charge and
they are bound to punish the woman' In
some form for the mischief she has done.
When spoken to on this matter Mrs. Na
tion laughed and said:
."I expect they will resort to this as a
last means to make me abandon* my cru
sade against the . liquor â¢. dealers, , but* I
will appeal to every liberal â¢ minded per
son and let them judge in any argument
with mo and my conversation whether
or not 1 am crazy. As I sit alonÂ» la this
cell and think of how many boya are
â¢going- to the dog's' because of this evil
traffic in liquor I am ready to endure
anything for the cause. When I leave this
prison 1 will not be conquered; I will go
on to other cities and there do Just what
I have done in Wichita. Tl^ere are thou
sands of joints and open saloons taking
the money and manhood from our young
men and officers stand by and take fines
and bribes to allow such awful work to
continue. I appeal to the . people in the
Cast to stop such abuses -of the law. I
admit that my method of wrecking- sa
loons has been rather out of the bounds
of the general custom, but something des
perate Is necessary. â¢
"If the people of the East who are for
temperance will lend me their moral sup
port and Influence with the few hard
working temperance women of Kansas
we will be able to get rid of the joints
in Kansas, and I don't think they would
ever come back. All I want Is people to
help me out of these scrape3 - when I
wreck saloons. . I need money to pay my
fines so I can get out and go at It again,
instead of lying in jail. True, I can now
get out on bail and go to Fmashingr
saloons again, and I may yet decide to
do such work, but I want to make a clean
sweep as I go, and not have fines hanging
over my head. Quick aid is what is need
ed. Money to prosecute this work must
be forthcoming immediately, i I will make
the saloon men sjrry, and in three months
there will not be one joint in the State.
I point with pride, to what work I have
already accomplished in Medicine Lodge
and Klowa. Both towns are devoid of
joint* because of my work, and no one
will deny it."

There is a quaint little fish which
haunts the weed tracts of the gulf stream
and there builds its nest and lays Its eggs
like a bird rather than a llsh. This ani-
malâthe antennarlusâ imitates in color
the weed it lives it, and, like the chame-
leon, constantly changes its color.

\ Everything on this train is real. i
Begins January i st % ! ;The rival factions of the Sam Tups and
Bee Tups, the two most powerful organi
sations of Chinatown, are on the verge of
a bloody war. Yesterday Chief of Police
* Sullivan received word tha.t hostilities
were imn-inent between the two societies,
and he lost no time In sending an extra
squad of policemen Into Chinatown with
instructions to prevent the threatened
clash at all hazards. Orders were Issued
to all the policemen in the Chinese quarter
to hold up the fighters of both organiza
tions and search them for weapons. The
Chief Intends to take every precaution to
prevent the threatened war, but realizes
the hopelessness of his task.
It is known that a number of desperate
highbinders have arrived here in the past
few days from various interior counties,
expecting to take a hand in the inevitable
conflict.
"The threatened clash cannot be avert
ed," remarked a Chinaman who is friendly
to the police, yesterday, "as both sides are
anxious for a battle, and no power will
stop it. despite the precautions taken by
Chief of Police Sullivan and his men. The
threatened shedding of blood would have
taken place a week ago but for the inter
position of the more influential Chinese,
who were waiting the decision of the
Police Commissioners on the proposition
of licensing gambling in Chinatown.
"As I understand it. the members of the
See Yups, Incensed at the killing of one of
their number at Marysville some time ago
by a Sam Yup man, declared war against
that organization. The usual rewards
were offered for the heads of the various
members of the Sam Yup Company, but
as the matter of licensing gambling in
Chinatown was then before the Police
Commissioners it was decided not to open
hostilities until final action had been
taken by the board on the gambling sub
â¢'Kow that the matter has been decided
the warring factions are arming them
selves and are ready to do battle. The
Sam Yups have Imported some of the
best fighters in this State and are conn
dent of vanquishing their deadly foes. The
See Yups, evidently expecting a hard bat
tle, have summoned their most trusted
warriors and are eagerly waiting for the
first shot to be fired."

The celebration of the thirty-seventh
anniversary of the emancipation procla
mation * was held at the First A. M. , E.
Zlon Church last night. I Rev. T. Brown,
pastor of the church, presided, ,and the
address 'of the i evening was delivered by
George "W. Dennis Jr. , Mr. 'Dennis spoke
of, the .wonderful growth of -the United
States;during the past century, and told
of the great possibilities of the next. Hp
then outlined what had been accomplished
by the negro during the thirty-seven
years I of : his Jf reedom.
"The negro race," said Mr. Dennis, "has
demonstrated Its fitness for civilization
and that it is worthy of the progress and
prosperity which has visited our glorious
country. The negro has sat In the Senate,
in Congress, has held judicial positions,
and has taken a front rank In the â¢ busy
marts of commerce, and on the battle
field he has not been* found, wanting. He
has: shown., that he has aims and ambi
tions that are as honorable and compara
ble with- those of other men whose skin
Is lighter In color."
.Mr. Dennis" then exhorted his. hearers to
equip themselves for the battle of life,
and to be honorable in their dealings with
their fellow- men. ,
During the evening Miss Pauline Bryant

Vivian Simmons recited "Lift the- Black
Man's Burden,". Professor J. H. Â¦William

TRIPLE TRAGEDY
OVER CARD GAME
Not Being' Permitted to Play,
In 1S93 the Sea Breeze and W. H. Meyer
were lost, and the rept of the fleet about
paid expenses, f In 1894 McKenna only
sent out the', barks Reindeer and James
Allen. When they weie gone he started
for ; Europe and purchased the Fearless.
The James Allen and Reindeer were both
lost, and In 1895 Captain , McKenna is
found .wintering in the Arctic Â¦ with Â¦ the
Fearless ' and bark Northern Light. In
1696 they were still in -the frozen north,
but in 1897 the Northern Light came home
without '; having made expenses. In 1893
the Fearless- came home "clean," The
steamer was taken by the creditors and
sold by the United States Marshal. Cap
tain McKenna's friends came to his res
cue and thought the, vessel in. They ad
vanced the money to fit her out, and
again the plucky' mariner sought fortune
in the frozen* north. Â¦; This year â¢ he has
done fairly well, and it Is to be hoped that
the back of his bad luck is broken.
In 1892 the Sea Breeze came back with a
fair catch, as did also the James Allen.
,The John P. West was burned at Hono
lulu, and the Northern Light came in
"clean." The Hunter made a splendid
catch, but the W.- H. Meyer, was "clean,"
and the Bonanza had only 5000 pounds of
bone..
It is seldom -that bad luck pursues, a
man as it has Captain McKenna. He has
striven against ill luck since 1891 and ill
luck has won. In the beginning of that
year he sent out the brig W. H. Meyer,
the bark Northern Light, bark Hunter,
bark Sea Breeze, bark James Allen,
schooner Bonanza and bark John P. West.
Not one of the fleet made an unusual
catch and some of them came home
"clean." < .

CAPTAIN McKENNA'S STEAM
WHALER FEARLESS AND
SOME OF HER PASSENGERS.
+- -Tâ V
stopped off Cape Nome, and then had to
run for Unalaska under stress of weather.
At the latter place she remained ten days
and took in a good supply of coal. Heavy
weather and light winds alternated all
the way down, and the provisions soon be
gan to give out. When the whaler was
off Coos Bay there was nothing left but
"salt horse" and coffee, and no water with
which to make the latter. Each man's al
lowance was cut to the lowest peg. and,
sooner than make them suffer, the captain
decided to put into Coos Bay.
No sooner was the whaler alongside the
wharf than the .carpenter, two firemen,
nine sailors and the cabin and steerage
boys deserted. This left Captain McKen
na with three boat-steerers, one sailor and
the steward outside his officers with
which to bring the ship to San Francisco.
Nothing daunted he made the attempt
and landed the Fearless in port yesterday
morning.
The Fearless brought down an Involun
tary passenger. Dick, an Eskimo, board
ed the vessel at Point Barrow and asked
for a passage to Point" iiope. He was re
fused and bundled aahore. Watching his
opportunity he Etowed himself away and
came on deck when the Fearless was well
under way. \ At Point Hope there was an
unusual quantity of ice for. that time of
the year, and besides it was blowing a
gale and icicles were in the air. There was
nothing for it but to, bring Dick to San
Francisco, and he is now aboard the steam
whaler. Captain McKenna .will care for
him until next spring and will then' take
him bnck to the Arctic. !Â£Â£*Â§Â£&Â£Â£&â¢â¢ â¢
WHEN the steam whaler Fear
lees left here on April 6. 1S99.
Captain James McKenna told
his friends and backers that
he would not come back from
the frozen north until he had captured
enough whales to pay all his debts.
The Fearless returned to port early yes
terday morning, but Captain McKenna's
hopes have not been realized. During her
first season the Fearless went well to tho
westward, and not a whale was caught.
Two whales that had been caught by the
natives were secured 'for "trade," how
ever, eo that evened up matters a little.
The Fearless then went Into winter quar
ters, and in the spring secured four more
whales. In all 6he secured about 10 000
pounds of "bone,"' which will more than
pay expenses, but it will not net a great
deal for Captain McKenna.
While in the Arctic a.id again along the
coast the Fearless met with nothing but
hard luck. Off Point Barrow whales were
again and again seen. spouting, but they
were always In a hole In the ice and the
fcteamer was in another. In a clear sea.
with the water as calm as a mill pond, a
whale would spout a mile away,, but as
soon as he heard the dip of the 'oar he
would sound, and that would be the last
seen of him.
The whales are well trained in Arctic
waters, an3 they know the sound of an
oar in the rowlock' as well as an old
sailor. . â¢ Â¦ .
Then th* Fearless was caugrth in some
heavy seas and lost three bf her whale
boats. Harry Spencer, 18 years old. was
taken sick, and In spite of everything that
could be done for him he died in the
spring and was buried at Cape Bathurst.
Captain McKenna refused to throw the
body overboard, but went ashore with a
burying party and saw the remains placed
under the frozen sod.
After leaving Point Hope the Fearless
There was one item m "Whitney's favor
to-night when he made his heroic stand
and saved a trainload of passengers from
a frightful death. He was moving cau
tiously across the approach and the slow
speed enabled him to more easily check
headway when the poundidg over the
roadbed commenced. But even then the
intrepid knight of the throttle had all h<5
could do to prevent the engine from run
ning upon the bridge, where surely, the
trainmen believe, it must have ended in
the toppling over of the locomotive intu
the brink and carry wUh it the cars that
were trailing behind.
Three tracks meet at the point where
the derailment occurred. One is the long,
straight line from Alameda across the
marsh. From the west comes the curved
combination narrow* and broad gauge
tracks from Alameda mole. The three
meet within twenty feet of the junction
of the southern approach embankment
and the bridge. At that point an inter
locking automatic "point switch, oper
ated from the bridge bignal station, is lo
cated. This switcn controls the tracks
and is utilized for either broad or narrow
gauge service from the west. At 6:30 last
night, shortly before the train that waÂ»
derailed came along from Alameda, a nar
row-gauge freight tram bound for Four
teenth and Webster streets Oakland,
passed over the switch safely and ran on
jo its destination. That switch, accord
ing to the telltale evidence at the point
of Â¦ derailment, was not thrown back,
either from carelessness of the operator
or because it failed io work. Whitney ran
down the mile of straight track to a sig
nal post a hundred yards from the draw,
where he stopped.
"The signal was set against me," he ex
plained last night, "and I had to stand
there for live minutes. Tuen I received a
band signal from the bridge to como
ahead. The towerman for some reason
had ordered his assistant down to flag me
ahead by hand. , As soon as I got that
signal I started up. As soon as I struck
th^ switch I felt a sudden lunge and
pounding ofÂ»the engine. Realizing; that
â¢I v?as off the track. 1 shut dov.-n as quick
ly as possible. The engine ran down to
the I edge of the approach before wo
stopped. We were derailed by running on
the [narrow-gauge track, the switch be
ing (pen.
"Gt course I do not know" why the
switch was open. The hand signal from
the bridge should not have been given un
less the towerman knew that the switch
was closed. But I don't know anything
about that. All I do know is that the
signal to go ahead was given and ahead I
went. Both the hand signal and a set
signal on the north side of the bridge gave
me the right to go ahead."
Whitney modestly disclaimed any hero
ism in his act. Fireman John Barnes
thought the engineer was a hero, rating
Al. Barnes was making ready to take a
flying leap for safety when the crash on:
the ties occurred. Conductor Alexander
Buchanan steadied tho passengers, who
were startled by the sudden stop of tho
train at the bridge end. They were sub
sequently transferred .to a train that
backed down to Alameda mole. The ex
planation made by -Assistant Division Su
perintendent W. S. Palmer, who was early
at the scene, follows:
"Until a full and complete investigation
can be held I am unprepared to place tho
responsibility for this- accident. Th2
throwing of the broadgauge , engine by an
open switch upon the narrow-gauge tracks
naturally derailed the - locomotive. But
the speed under which the local was run
ning prevented anything Berious. The ten
der wheels did not leave the track nor
did any of the passenger coach trucks.
The most serious feature of this affair is
the blocking of travel. There bÂ«>ing only
a single track here everything must be
held up until we can get this train out of
the way." Â¦"
As soon as Whitney felt the pounding of
his locomotive" wheels over the ties he
realized his danger. Instead of looking
for a place to leap and save himself from
the disaster he telt was upon his train,
the brave engineer stuck at his post and
coolly brought his ) derailed engine to a
standstill. Tnere was just room tor a man
to crawl around the pilot without stand
ing on the drawbridge itself when tha
engine was brought to a full stop. One
side of the big locomotive was careened
and within, a couple of feet of the de
railed driving wheels was a plunge of
twenty feet aown into the waters of the
estuary, where ten vears ago, by an al
most similar accident, thirteen lives were
lost in a submerged local train.
A /railroad horror, parallel to. that. of
Mayday, 1890, when r u Southern Pacific
narrow-gauge train ran through the open
draw at Alice street bridge,' in Oakland.
was averted last night at the new Harri
son. I street railroad bridge only by tho
coolness of Engineer 'W. H. Whitney, in
charge of the 6:30 o'clock broadgauge local
train from Park street. Alameda, headed
for. Oakland pier. Hid engine. No. 1220,
hauling three crowded coaches, was de
railed at the brink of the southern ap
proach to the bridge, a misplaced switch
causing the accident.
