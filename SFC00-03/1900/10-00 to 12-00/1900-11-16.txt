Correspondence has passed recently be

resuming the work and. now that the
e'.f-ctiot.s en bcth sides of the border are
over, there is felt to ."Â» more time and op
portunity to devote to the serious ques
tions involved before this commission. It
is understood that the American Commis
sioners desire to remove the possibility of
ruch ineffectual results as occurred at
th<?!r last Pitting. The Indications are that
this can be done through the co-operation
of the State Derartmont by omitting the
Alaskan boundary question from thoÂ«e to
be considered, thus removir.gr the chief ob
starle to rrÂ°?rress.
On the Alaska question the commission
was practically deedloeked. and It made
no report of progress on other questions,
because of the Inability to Include this
question. Since then, however, a modus
Vivendi on Alaska has been agreed upon,
and vhllo this iacks permanency It is felt
that the question can be best left to direct
negotiation between the two governments.
thus r^rmittlPK the commission to pro
ceed with the nr.any other important ques

rrafie In this particular will depend upon
the conferences now going on. The pur
pose of the commission Is to frame a new
treaty between the United States and
Great Britain covering the various
questions arising along the Canadian bor

controversy. The questions before the

KILLED IN A DISASTER
To-night Dr. Ross has no further state
ment to make nor has he anything to re
cant. He still stands by his original
statement and says that It covers every
thing he had to say. As to the future hÂ«
has no definite plans, except that he will
continue his work In sociology wherever
he may be called. ,
To-day the members of Dr. Ross' sem
inary, which is composed of the fourth
year students in the economies depart
ment, drew up a strong testimonial, in
which they expressed their sincere regret
in the loss of Dr. Ross. They paid a glow
ing tribute to his character and personal
worth, as well as to his ability as a
teacher and investigator.

To-night, while he is as firm as ever in
his championship of the right of Intellect
ual freedom, he sees more clearly the po
sition of Mrs. Stanford upon the matter.
"When told of the current report that nÂ»
would resign his "position because of Dr.
Ross' dismissal, he denied It flatly, say
ing that he had no such intention. Ho will
remain at Stanford.
Another thing, which shows that the
general attitude toward Mrs. Stanford is
changing is Dr. Howard's position to
night. This morning. Instead of delivering
his regular lecture, In his French Revolu
tion class on' Voltaire, he spoke upon the
presence of bigotry and intolerance at the
present time, claiming that the example
of Dr. Ross .was parallel to that of Vol
taire.
. The fact that Dr. Ross was eminent in
his science did not solace her wounds.
Other professors In the Stanford faculty
have spoken as freely on public question*
as has Dr. Ross, but not one word of dis
approval has she raised. As In her state
ment to President Jordan In the letter
written from Geneva, October 2S. she says
that she -has tried even prayerfully to
forgive Dr. Ross, but that she could not,
therefore It was best that he should go.
This letter was received by President Jor
dan on November 12. Just three days ago.
The same day he notified Dr. Ross that he
would accept his resignation. It will thus
be seen that there was no delay in accept
ing the resignation until after the election.
for political effect, as the letter which de
termined Dr. Jordan's action did not
reach here until six days after the elec
tion had been held.
"When it is considered that Mrs. Stan
ford is a woman of Intense feeling and al
most ultra sensitive as to reflections upon
the memory and honor of her dead
husband it can readily be seen
why she should object to Dr.
Ross' presence on her faculty. How
ever, she was Inclined to be generous with
him. A year's leave of absence, with full
pay, was at his disposal while he might
be on the hunt for a new position. It was
not a Question of free speech or Intel
lectual bondage with her. She had been
offended by what she could not believe to
be otherwise than direct attacks upon her
husband's memory.
It develops that her real objection to Dr.
Roes' lecture upon Asiatic immigration
was not due to the fact that she differed
from him In his conclusions, which. It is
sa!d. she does not. but because she was
led to the belief by false reports and state
ments, that seemed credible, that he had
made a covert attack upon the Senator,
whose memory she feels should be In
violable.
Mrs. Stanford Is aware of the fact that
other professors at the university have
expressed similar views under similar cir
cumstances. The personal reasons for
Dr. Ross' dismissal consist In part of
what she interpreted as derogatory refer
ences to Senator Stanford. Some oqe rep
resented to Mrs. Stanford that Dr. Ross
had frequently In the classroom jharac
terlzed the Southern Pacific Railroad
deals as "railroad steals," and otturwiaa
held Senator Stanford up as a dangerous
example before the business world
appears that none of these offenses con
stitute the real motive for Professor Rosa*
dismissal.

In answer to these remarks, which
throw a somewhat different light than th^
first upon the. whole unfortunate contro
versy. Professor Ross said this morning.
"Dr. Jordan' known vastly more
than I do rm to Mri. Stanford's mo
tives, and whatever he says Is con
clusive as far as I am concerned.
In my original statement, .which
warn carefully prepared and In
strictly correct, I said I have loner

persons and interests In . San Fran

(tlad to know It.
,"It Is absolutely certain, however,
that freedom of speech Is Involved:
not my appearance, personality or
character, but solely my non-pnrtl
Â«an, scientific utterances, have been
the root of .Mrs. Stanford's distrust
of me."
To-night sentiment at the university
seems to be gradually changing. Not that
Dr. Ross is being condemned, but there
is a growing sentiment of sympathy ta
Mrs. Stanford.' This change Is due in a
great measure to the opinion among tte
Stanford alumni, or especially those who
were here when 'the first signs of friction
between Mrs. Stanford and Professor
Ross arose four years ago. From state
ments made by the alumni it Is 'earned
that' Mrs. Stanford considered the expres

of the university rule that members of

Sheriff Jones, however, agreed to keep
the prisoner for ten days, and Porter was
rushed through the mob to the County
Jail before the gathered crowd realized
what was being done. Sheriff Freeman
paid that District Attorney McAllistf r had
threatened to hold him on a charge of
murder if the negro were *aken from his
custody and lynched. He was told that
as he had a warrant for Porter the Dis
trict Attorney had no authority to Inter
fere to prevent him from serving 5t and
taking his prisoner to Hugo Jail. Free

When the father of Louise Frost heard
of Freeman's decision he sought out the
Sheriff and cursed him fiercely. Mr. Frost
Is now under the care of friends. All his
composure Is gone and the thought that
vengeance may not be meted out to his
child's murderer has driven him tempor
arily Insane.
At Llmon to-night a mass-meeting of
citizens voted unanimously that it was
the duty of Sheriff Freeman to his con
stituents to bring the negro back, and the
resolution was telegraphed to him.
Seventy-five leading citizens of Lincoln
County wired Governor Thomas, who is
the head of the police power of Denver,
that they proposed simply to tie a rope
around Porter's neck and to drop him off
the railroad bridge. They "promised that
there would be no atrocities, and demand
ed, the sending of the negro, naively add
ing: "Please send on to-night's train, as
we want to go home. .Will' wait ten days
if necessary."
Young Porter sent two notes this after

them read. "I am guilty, but offel sorry,"
and the other. "Please pray for me."

These words, startling and radical, were
greeted by tremendous applause from the
listening students, and the incident has
been ever since the subject of excited
comment. The excitement over the main
incident of which this is a development is.
however, dying out. The first thought of
the student body to hold some sort of a
demonstration to express regret and in
dignation at the retirement of -Professor
Ross has been abandoned. The faculty
will, as a matter, of course, take no ac
tion, and as far as university opinion is
concerned the incident seems to be closed.
The more conservative students feel that
only added harm to the university can
come from further agitation and discus
sion, and there is a general disposition to
let the matter drop. The student body It
Is expected 'will, however, present to Pro
fessor Ross a testimonial of Us good will
before he leaves Palo Alto.
In the present controversy, created by
the enforced resignation of Professor
Rcss, much interest attaches to the ques
tion whether or. not Mrs. Stanford has
the legal right, under the terms of the
endowment of Stanford University, to dic
tate absolutely her opinions of the char
acter and scope of the Intellectual field "of
the great school.
By the terms of the endowment of the
institution; the sole management of the
university and its properties is vested In
the grantors during their lives, or tho life
of either of them. This provision assevers
the problem. Mrs. Stanford has absolute
ly the right to do as she pleases with the
institution at Palo Alto. The trustees of
the university are powerless to act in any
vital matter until the death of Mrs. Stan
ford. Eventually the entire management
of the institution will be In their hands;
at present it is exclusively under the con
trol of Mrs. Stanford.
To President Jordan,' however, practical
control of the educational features of the
institution was given by the late Senator
Stanford and by Mrs. Stanford. President
Jordan was given power to choose his as
sociates; to! hold them responsible for
their educational work. To him was given
the right to dismiss these men. The res
ignation ot a professor., forced by Mrs.
Stanford and not by. President Jordan,
has necessarily excited considerable com
ment, more particularly by the fact that
President Jordan announces his complete
confidence" In Â¦ the man who has been
forced to retire from the university.
In an authorized description of Stanford
University the following I b said: "What
characterizes Stanford is that, finding it
self untrammeled by the limitations, the
vested rights, the ultra-conservative in
fluences which surround the older col
leges and universities, tt has had the cour

tain lines of educational progress further

>s^ TANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 15.
(^^. â New fire was added to-day to the
of agitation which Is sweep-
over the university, involving
' the faculty and student body alike,
because of the forced resignation of Pro
fessor Ross. It seemed until this morning
that all had been. said in reference to the
matter, but Professor George E. Howard
has added new words to the bitterness of
the affair, and the entire college commu
nity Is discussing what the outcome of his
position will be.
Professor Howard is a close personal
friend ...of, .. Professor Ross. Both have
.shared the same independence and the in
tellectual radicalism which have brought
such a storm around the university. "When
Professor Ross" resignation was an
nounced Professor Howard was outspoken
in his censure of the conditions which had
forced hla friend out of the university. He
was one of the lew members of the facul
ty here who accepted the opportunity and
the consequences of speaking his opinions
and to-day he supplemented his remarks
by a performance which is without paral
lel in the history of Stanford.
Professor Howard is the head of the
department of history. of the university
and this irornlnj: he gave up his custom
ary lecture ami devoted himself to a dis
cussion of the Koss incident. He declared
that Professor Ross was a martyr to a
principle which cannot be sacrificed, and
that his forced retirement from the uni
versity will work immeasurable evil to the
institution. He declared that in the retire

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â Secretary
l^ng to-day announced the conclusion of
the long controversy over the price of
armor plate for naval vessels and an.
agreement with the Carnegie and tho
Bethlehem companies for Krupp armor at
W20 a ton, with the possible addition of
royalty fees, making the maximum price
$455 E2 a ton. Tho amount of armor in
volved Is the largest ever placed at onÂ©
time by the Government and is said to
equal all the armor purchased by the
Government up to 1S'J6. It cover* th<*
armor for seventeen ships now In various
stages of construction, including eight
battleships, six armored cruisers and
three protected cruisers.
The following official statement was
given out concerning the agreement:
"The Navy Department has come to aa
agreement with the Carnegie and Beth
lehem companies for Krupp armor of the
first class, amounting to -i.Sio tons, tot
$420 per ton.
"Tlie Kxupp process Involves the Har
vey patent, the validity of which Is now
under consideration by the courts, and It
is further agreed that the Government
will assume in addition any liability for
the Krupp process not exceeding Â£5, cr
$2\ 32 a ton fcr Krupp royalty, and not
exceeding the United States license fee of
$11 20 for Harvey royalty. The maximum
price to the Government is therefore
{455 52 a ton. subject to diminution, in case
of any reduction in the foregoing royal
ties. The bid of these companies for this
elas3 of armor was $490 and the pries
originally asked was $543.
"The MIdvale Company some time ago
withdrew their bid. but they would have
been unable. In any event, to furnish
armor Jn due season for the Maine class
of battleships. Had they not withdrawn
their bid, it Is probable that some ar
rangement might have been made for the
distribution among the three companies of
the manufacture of armor other than for
the Maine claes. Their bid, however, waa
of value in enabling the department to
secure the above large reduction."
Admiral O'Neill, chief cf the Bureau of
Ordnance, said cf the result:
â¢"The agreement Is most satisfactory.
The terms are reduced not only to a rea
sonable point but more than reasonable.
We get armor cheaper than any other
country in the world." .
The armor contract covers not only the
24,950 tons specified In the official state
ment, but also some 10,000 tons of armor
of the second and third class which has
not been in controversy, but has been de
pendent on the disposal of the first class
armor. The entire amount, approximate
ly So. 000 tons, is now made available.

to be. built at the works of the Eastern
Sh!p-Eulldi:.g Company at Groton, oppo
site New London, and from this date the
work of putting together the hulls of the
ships will go rapidly on. .
There was issued from the office of the
company to-day an authoritative state
ment regarding the Bize of the ships,
which shows them to be the largest ves
sels in the world now building 1 or planned.
The new vessels will be of 20,000 tons reg
ister and 33,000 tons displacement, or 10,
0C0 tons more displacement than the new
Atlantic greyhound Deutschland. The
new steamers, which are being built pri
marily for cargo carriers, are not so long
as many Atlantic liners, but are much
wider and deeper. The following are the
principal dimensions of- the vessels:
Length. CO feet; beam, 73 feet; depth, 56
feet. ! They - have each five continuous
decks extending the whole length of the
ship, with three additional partial decks
amidships.
Passengers as well as freight will be
carried and accommodations are provided
for nearly 1000 passengers in three classes
The vessel wfll have a speed of fourteen
knots an hour and will carry over 4000
tons of coal in the bunkers. They are
designed to carry cattle, chilled or frozen
meats in refrigerator chambers, fruit or
any kind of cargo that may appear for
transportation.
It Is estimated that when completed the
(steamships will ' cost - f Hlly $5,000,000 â¢ and

WASHINGTON. Nov. 15.â News was re

phoid fever of Mrs. McKlnley's nephew,
Assistant Paymaster J. S. Barber, at
Hongkong. The news came in the form
of a dispatch to the Navy Department
from the commander of the Monterey, to
which young Barber was attached.
News of the death was conveyed to the
White House personally by Captain
Crowles, acting chief of the Navigation
Bureau, and caused great grief to Mrs.
McKlney and ihe President. â¢
Mr. Darber entered the Ohio volunteers
at the outbreak of the Spanish war as a
private with his cousin. James McKinley,
and was commended for gallant conduct.
He was mustered out at the end of the
war and when he recovered his strength
which had been shattered by the expo
sure and hardships to which he had been
subjected, he was given a commission in
the navy as an -ns.s'stant paymaster. He
was sent to the Phllppines at his own re
quest, being attached to the Don Juan do
Austria. Afterward he was transferred
to the monitor Monterey, but in the lat
ter his health again Rave way and he had
been lying ill with typhoid fever at Hong
kong for several weeks past.
Mr. Corea called at the State Depart
ment during the day and paid his respects
to Secretary Hay, in particular express
ing his pleasure at the announcement that
President McKinley hod Invited his Cabi

other four years.
"So that," he added In conclusion. "I
am happy to say, Nicaragua in free to ne
gotiate with any one ready to negotiate
concerning the canal and especially the

Concerning the Eyre-Cragin canal con
cession, Mr. Corea said the Nicaraguan
Government had declared officially that
this concession was nullified in connec
tion with the provisions of the contract.
The old concession, he said, has ceased
to attract attention.
When asked as to the nature of his In
structions, Mr. Corea said it was inexpe
dient to discuss them In detail, but It
could be said they were sufficient to meet
conditions ns they might arise In connec
tion with the progress of the canal affairs
in this country and co-operate in such
new treaty relations as might become de
sirable. When Inquiry was made as to
the long pending misunderstanding be
tween Nicaragua and Costa Rica In con
nection with the canal, Mr. Corea said
that by a fortunate arrangement this had
been entirely removed.
"There never has been a time," said he.
"when the relations between the two
countries has been more close and cordial.
On July 24 there was celebrated the con
clusion of a boundary line which has
been for years the cause of misunder
standing. President Zelaya is anxious
to sustain at any cost the peace of Cen

CALX. BUREAU, "WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.-Although
the administration, In the Interest of
maintaining the concert In China, agreed
to several propositions incqrporated in the
list of demands to be made by tha pow
ers to which it had objection, it disap
proves decidedly of the suggestion that
the tombs of the Ming dynasty be de
stroyed. It has been asserted that this
will have a lasting effect upon the CM

else prevent recurrence of the recent out
rages. But Its adoption, it Is feared by
administration officials, will cause a vio
lent upheaval In China and cause the re
newal of Chinese resistance, which ap
parently at least one power of Europe is
earnestly endeavoring to accomplish.
The reverence entertained by Chinese
for the, tombs of thÂ«"!r ancestors is well
known, but the feeling felt for the tombs
cf tile dynasty Is even more profound and
an attempt to destroy them may cause
serious trouble. A high official said to
day that the effect on the Chinese would
be the same as the effect on the civilized
world should barbarians destroy Bethle
hem. The proposal is placed on a par
with the vengeful propositions fathered

friction does exist between the Ministers
and military, and some friction has been

corrected, are of another character. There
was some complaint that the pauses be
tween the acts were too long, and the
police decided that these waits must not
last over fifteen minutes. The police also
discovered that certain actors were being
applauded far beyond their real merits.
They therefore decided that In future no
actor may bo applauded more than three
times during the same performance.

SEATTLE. Nov. 15.â The steamer Ruby
A. Cousins, which sailed from this port
several weeks ago laden with a general
cargo of Government supplies for the sol
diers at Port Valdes, now lies a total
wreck in the Narrows at the entrance to
Prince William Sound. Captain F. L.
Dowell. her master and owner, returned
from the north to-day, bringing details of
the disaster.
The Cousins was wrecked while trying
to pass through the Narrows without the
aid of a tug. Captain Dowell was en
tirely familiar with the waters of the Nar
rows, but encountered adverse currents,
and the vessel rapidly drifted on to the
shoals, where she was pounced to pieces
before any attempts could be made to
save her valuable cargo, which was to
tally ruined. The wreck was attended
with no loss of life. The crew escaped in
small boats and were later picked up and
taken to Port Valdes, from which point
they took a steamer to this city.
BEGEROW ON THE STAND.
ing of Cech and Berger.
Sticks to His Original Story of Shoot-
SAN JOSE, Nov. 15.â The cross-exami
nation of Frederick Begerow, on trial for
the murder of Joseph Cech, was taken up
at the opening of court this morning. The
defendant reiterated the details of the
double tragedy at the brewers' picnic. He
stuck well to his story. Begerow claimed
he only fired in self-defense. Cech and
Berger had taken a prisoner, "Bis
marck," away from him. They followed
him up. beating him and threatening to
kill him. He warned them he was an of
ficer and for them to desist. At last he
was compelled to shoot. Before doing so
he fired one shot in the air. 0
The prosecution offered some testimony
In rebuttal. John Duncan said he saw the
parties in the crowd that congregated
after the shooting trip up and hit Bege
row. He said the blood stains on the
clothes of the Constable were from these
attacks.
Ralph Peters, John Maloney and Tom
Stone gave some Immaterial testimony.
William Gresslnger declared he had
struck the Constable after his arrest -at
least half a dozen times. He contended
the bruises on the officer's face were made
by himself and others, and not Cech and
Berger.
An attempt was made to show that
Begerow was quarrelsome when drinking
by testimony of Mrs. Emerson of Alvlso
and Tom Sourrlsseau, but the court ruled
it out.
Hugo Liebenthal, Victor Baumgartner,
Caspar Shale, Jailer Dreischmeyer and
Deputy Sheriff Gruell were examined, but
they did not alter the -story of the defend
ant to any extent.
The case will probably go to the Jury
Monday, afternoon. *

Special IMspatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 15.â Mill Valley is
ablaze with indignation. A bold counter
feiter has ornamented the legs of the tur
keys, ducks and geese of the town with
spurious license tags, thus delivering a
eolar plexus blow to the pound ordinance.
The startling discovery was made by
Poundman Charles Cline early yesterday
morning, when he captured a goose and
two roosters which were wearing the han
diwork of the counterfeiter. Mr. Cline
was on his usual morning tour of the
town, when his attention was attracted to
a large -willowy necked gander, whose tag
had slipped from his knee and was slap
ping around on top of his expansive foot.
Not wishing to see the owner lose the tag
Mr. Cline got out his goose call and de
livered several mandatory "honks,"
whereupon the intelligent bird came to a
halt and allowed the poundman to handle
the tag. No sooner had Mr. Cline's hand
touched the metal than he realised that
he was toying with the handiwork of a
dangerous counterfeiter. Upon inspection
the tag showed much Ingenuity, though it
bristled with faults. Instead of being
made of 104 proof aluminum, like the gen
uine, it was coined of 14-karat brass and
thinly plated with tin.
After making the discovery Mr. Cline
sought the services of Constable Richard
McDonald and his riata. Together they
lassoed and threw many of the tagged
fowl. Seven bogus tags rewarded their
efforts.
When Police Judge C. T. Conlan re
turned to San Francisco from his summer
home in the valley he left a large asth
matic rooster, upon the advice of his phy
sician, who told him that the bird would
never survive the fogs of the metropolis.
This morning Cline and McDonald pur
sued the rooster into a hollow tree and
found that he was passing the "queer"
upon the poundman. Ho was placed in a
Back after his leg was relieved of its bo
gus tags. Half an hour later Professor
George Miehllng's wrestling rooster
"Olympic" was found roaming the streets
and scratching worms with a limb that
carried another bogus tag. He joined
Conlan'B rooster in the sack and both are
now in the Cline barn.
Cline and McDonald have organized a
secret service bureau and the guilty man
will be hunted to earth. No' expense will
be spared. Once a week from now on
Poundman Cline will line up the fowl of
the valley for inspection and examine the
tags.

STOCKTON. Nov". 15.â The defense In
the case of Captain Williams, charged
with the murder of Conductor William

testified positively that Martin struck
Williams just before the latter drew his
revolver and fired. Witness declared that
he was standing at the bar at the time,

SEATTLE, V.'ash., Nov. 15.â The Cor
oner of King County will to-morrow lm
panel a jury to investigate the cause of
the < death of Mabel L. Ingalls, a younyr
.girl lately resident of the suburban town
of Ballard, who died suddenly November
3 and was buried next day. There is
every reason to believe that evidence of
the most sensational character will be
presented to the Jury, upon whose find
ings another human lile may depend.
Saturday afternoon, November 3. Mabe!
Ingalls was alive and .well. That after
noon she and a young friend and neigh
bor, Miss Adams, were invited to the
house' of Mrs. Laura M. Laurie, who
operates an employment agency in Bal
lard. The two girls were treated to cake
and wine just before leaving the house,
and before she could reach home Miss In
galls was taken violently ill. The. usual
home remedies for cramps were admin
istered, but without giving relief, and
during the evening a ynyslcian was sum
moned. He diagnosed the case as cholera
morbus and so treated it. The girl be
came rapidly worse. Late at night three
other physicians were called in, out their
efforts were of no avail, the *irl dying
early Sunday morning. The death certill
cate shows the cause as cholera morbus.
The remains were burled Sunaay after
noon.
In the midst of their first grief Mr. and
Mrs. C. G. . Ingalls, the parents of the
dead girl, accepted the physicians' state
ment as to the cause. Then they heard
the story from Miss Adams of the lunch
of cake and wine, and recalled o^her cir
cumstances which aroused their suspicion
of foul play.
Miss Ingalls had been engaged to marry
Krnest Carstens, a business man of Se
attle, and the wedding was to have taken
place in December. She had met Car
stens at Mrs. Laurie's home and their
acquaintance had ripened into love. Car
stens and Mrs. Laurie had been friends
long prior to his acquaintance with Miss
Ingalls and there were rumors of a more
intimate attachment. These facts Indi
cated to the parents of the girl a possible
motive for crime, which coupled with the
story of Miss Adams moved them to ap
peal to Coroner Sparling.
The facts In the case were laid before
the Coroner, who proceeded at once to in
vestigate.. The testimony of Miss Adams,
who accompanied Miss Ingalls to the
house of Mrs. Laurie and who there saw
her drink wine from a cup given' her by
Mrs. Laurie and who herself drank some
of the wine, determined the Coroner to
probe the case to the bottom. Miss
Adams' story that the woman had poured
the wine drunk by Miss Ingalls first into
a glass and then into a cup, and had her
self refused to drink the wine remaining
In the cup, Together with the fact that
Miss Ingalls, young and In perfect health,
was almost immediately taken violently
ill and died within a few hours, gave the
Coroner the clew upon which the chem
ists went to work.
Early yesterday morning the body of
the dead girl was exhumed from what ten
days before the clergyman had pro
nounced to be its last resting place. The
work was quickly done and the casket
conveyed to Bonney & Stewart's morgue.
On the casket being opened It was
found that the body had undergone not
the slightest change. Owing to the con
tinued cold weather and the presence of
an embalming fluid, the remains were in
a perfect state of preservation. The au
topsy was performed by Dr. Powers and
Dr. Bowies. Owing to the facts which
had come to their knowledge they re
moved more of the vital organs and 'soft
tissues of the body than is usual in such '
cases. When they had finished the body
was replaced in the casket. It was to-day
replaced In the grave.
Dr. Powers explained the reason for the
removal of more than the contents of the
stomach. Arsenlous acid, he said, had
been used by the undertaker in preparing
the body for interment, the fluid con
taining arsenic being introduced through
the nostrils. It was entirely likely, he
said, that the fluid had found Its way
into the stomach, thereby rendering it
Impossible to detect the presence in the
stomach of arsenic swallowed before
death. It was imperative to examine
other organs and tissues of the body for
traces of that poison.
It happens that arsenic Is the very
poison that it is suspected caused the
death of Miss Ingalls. It was the belief
of the physicians who attended here that
she died of cholera morbus. The symp
toms of this disease and of poisoning br
arsenic are so similar that it is practi
cally impossible for a skilled physician to
distinguish them In the absence of a his
tory of the case.
Naturally Drs. Powers and Bowles re
fuse to make public the result of the au
topsy. That they discovered something
that warrants the suspicion of foul Dlav
Is evident from the fact that on the
strength of their private report to Coro
ner Sparling an inquest has been ordered
From the outset Miss Ingalls' relatives
have refused publicly to discuss the mat
ter, further than to admit that it was at I
the instance of the father that the inves
tigation was held. Mrs. Laurie, who has
been discussed by the local press as the
woman in the case, was yesterday for the
first time mentioned in a local newspaper
by name, -together with the facts that
brought suspicion upon her.
A day" or so after Miss Ingalls' death
Mrs. Laurie left Ballard, going to Pres
ton, in this county, where her husband is
employed in a shingle mill. She returned
to Ballard yesterday, accompanied by her
husband, and to-day made a statement
for publication.
She states that the facts related by Miss
Adams are. substantially correct. She In
vited the two girls to her house and gave
them the cake and wine -of which both
partook. She Insists, however, that she
did not, as related by Miss Adams pour
the wine intended for Miss Ingalls from a
glass into a cup, and also says that she
herself drank of the same beverage. The
wine, she says, , was left with her as a
sample a few days previous by a travel
ing salesman.
She asserts that she and Miss Ingalls
were the dearest friends and .that no one
had rejoiced more than she- in the ap
proaching marriage of v Miss Ingalls to
Carstens. She also intimates that Mr. and
Mrs. Ingalls - have ; reasons to dislike her,
but refuses to discuss that phase of th*
matter until the inquest. *
Miss â¢ Ingalls was 22 years old and a
beautiful .girL She was trained for, the
profession of teaching, but" had been em
ployed as a- clerk In a Seattle store until
a few weeks prior to her death/ when she
left her place to prepare for her marriage.
Her father Is a jeweler in Ballard and the
family is ' considered highly respectable."
Mrs. Laurie is 38 or 40 years of age. and
In no way of a prepossessing appearance.
She conducts an . employment agency at
Ballard and lives npart from her husband,
although both state that their separation
Is merely a business arrangement and not
due to any matrimonial infelicity. . Mrs.
Laurie declares ,that she will face the In
quest In perfect confidence of vindication,
but the Sheriffs , office . is maintaining a
constant watch upon her, movements.

A LAW UNTO HIMSELF.
Every Man Must Be That, to Retain
Sis Health and Digestion.
There are thousands of people In this
world would eat no meat from one year's
end to another, and certain savage tribes
in Africa and Polynesia are almost ex-
clusively meat eaters: but while there are
thousar.ds cf these, there are millions who
live upon a mixed diet of meat, vegetables
and grains, and if numbers is a criterion
it would seem that a mixed diet Is the
Lt-st :"cr me human family.
The fact that you will find many vege-
tarians who appear healthy and vigorous
and mÂ«-at eaters equally so, and any num-
ber -of robust specimens who eat both
meat and vegetables and anything else
that comes their way all goes to show
that ;he old saw is the true one. that
every man must be a law to himself as
to what he shall eat and drink.
To repair the waste of tissue in brain
workers as well as to replace the muscle
and sinew of the laborer, can only be done
through the process of digestion.^
Every nerve, muscle, sinew, every drop
of blood, is extracted from the food we
cat and digest.
In these days of hustle and worry, and
artificial habits of life, scarcely one per-
son in a thousand can lay claim to a per-
fest digestion: dyspepsia is a national af-
fliction and Stuart s Dyspepsia Tablets a
national blessing.
Most cases of poor digestion are caused
by failure of the stomach to secrete suf-
ficient gastric juice, or too little hydro-
chloric aci-1 and lack of peptones, arid all
of these important essentials to perfect i
digestion are lound in Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets in convenient palatable form.
One or two of these tablets taken after
tneals insure perfect digestion and assim-
ilation of the food.
Cathartic pills and laxative me<licines
have no effect whatever in digesting food
and to call such remedies a cure for
dyspepsia is far fetched and absurd.'
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain pep-
ein free from animal matter, diastase and
otner digestives, ajid not only digest all
wholesome food, but tend to increase the
flew of gastric juices and by giving the
weak stomach a much needed rest bring
about at healthy condition of the digestive
crsans and a normal appetite.
Nervous, thin-blor>ded. run-down people
should bear in mind that drugs and stim-
ulants cannot furnish good biood, strong
muscle and steady nerves; the.se come
only from wholesome food, thoroughly
digested. A fifty-cent box of Stuart's
TuMfrts taken after meals for a few
weeks will do you more real good than
drugs, stimulants ar.d dieting combined.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is probably
the eafrst. most popular and ruccessful
cigestive on the market, and sold by drug-
gists ever^-v-here in the United States,

SILVER WINGS BEATS McKINLEY
IN A FIERCE AND FAST COURSE
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
Tjl it ODE8TO, Nov. 13.â J. H. Rosset
/AV/\l ers Ra ndom Aim and Erwin &
//W \\ L >' on>s Silver Wings divided the
A V iJLflrst money of the sixth open-
plains meetlrs of the Interstate
Coursing Assooij.tlon. The last course of
a three-dsys' running; was Random Aim
and-Lcdy Davenport a bye. Previous to
this Silver Wings met the redoubtable
Curtis & Sons' McKinley. a 4 to 1 favorite,
and ..to . the surprise of bt-ttors and form
experts the statesman trailed In clouds of
defeat. This course was the sensation of
the entire meet.
The result of it was full of m!sery to
Silver Wings and provocative of coursing
history. A year ago, on the Texan plains,
near Dallas, where the great American
"Waterloo was held, this same fleet and
grame hound worked her way down to the
finals, as did Emin Pasha, J. H. Rosseter's
representative entry. At that time Erwtn
& Lyon refused to force Emin Pasha, who
had just gone. through very severe work,
to try for the stake honors and insisted
upon a division of the purse. Since then
J. H. "Rosseter has been handling the
Texan greyhounds for Erwin & Lyon on
this coast. To-day the opportunity for a
leturn of courtesies occurred. Silver
"Wings, blown and Â»xhau*ted by the ter
rific course with McKlnley, was in no
shape for the final and deciding event.
The field stewards and Judge Grace, after
a careful examination, reached this con
clusion. They then advised Mr. Rosseter
to withdraw the dog. This ht mignt have
done, but he n.topted a different measure.
He divided the first prize onrl did not put
Silver* Wings, a used-up hound, to the
test. Far ami away the third day of the
meeting on the Modesto plains was the
most successful of all. In the flm place
the weather was decidedly more favorble
for good coursing, the hares more plenti
ful and the courses themselves were not
enveloped in clouds of dust impenetrable
to th3 sisrht of the spectators. No diffi
culty was found in running: clown the card
and there was a snap and precision that
was v.-antingr in the first two days" cours-
Ingr. Five dogs figured prominently in
this, the last day's sport on the plains-
Random Aim. Silver Wings, Sleety Mist,
Mekinley.and Royal Anne.
In the fourth round Sleety Mist met
Tommy Rex. It was all Sleety Mist. For
three minutes they tore over the plains
and then the official timer, glass In hand,
could follow them no longer. The sever
ity of the work ended Sleety Mist for fur
ther participation in the stake. In the
next round she was withdrawn. Royal
Anne, a Pasha Kennels entry, was a
strong performer until Silver Wings was
met. and then Erwin & Lyon triumphed

WHOSE DEPARTURE FOR THE PHILIPPINES WITH A GOVERN
MENT SURVEYING PARTY TO-DAY IS DEEPLY REGRETTED.
Hill; the Bliuie and Gold Emd 9 Qolog to PMJappiiiines, amd
Raitt 9 Cardinal. Quarterback, Called Home.
ps-r|-^HE last hope that the University
I of California student body had of
I retaining Joseph S. Hill on the var-
JLL sity eleven until after the annual
game against Stanford on Thanks
giving day was dissipated yesterday when
It was announced that the clever football
player "would sail on the transport Sher
idan tq^day. For the past month strong
influence was brought to bear on the par
ents of the young man to allow him to
don his footba'.l armor and once more do
battle for his college. When victory was
about to crown their efforts Hill and two
other California students were appointed
to join a survey party going to the Philip
pine. Islands for the United States Gov
ernment. Despite this the enthusiasts
continued their self-appointed task in the
hope that Hill might delay his passage to
the islands until after the Thanksgiving
day game. This was made impossible, as
Hill received peremptory orders from his
superiors to take passage on the Sheridan,
While the university will lose an expe
rienced end in Hill, the blue and gold men
are congratulating themselves that they
have a good substitute in Hudson. The
latter has been doing excellent work at
left end and bids fair to develop Into a
worthy side partner to "Wreck" Womble,
who is looked upon as being the cleverest
end ever seen on this coast.
Hill comes from Dixon. In his freshman
year he played on the "baby" team and
won the good will of his college mates by
his brilliant tackling and running down on
kicks. Garry Cochran took Hill in hand
and taught him many new tricks and last
year he and Womble surprised the cardi
nal players and the Carlisle Indians by
their splendid work. Hill, was anxious to
play again this season, but his parents
entered serious objection. His father, who
is a sport-loving rancher of Dixon, was
won over, but his mother, backed up by
his grandfather, ex-State Senator Mc-
Cune. were opposed. Mrs. Hill was proud
of her boy and was on the point of re
lenting, but the grandfather was obdu
rate. Committees from the university stu
dent body visited Dixon and tried to sway
him. but Senatcr McCune could not be
made to surrender. He had watched Hill's
course through college and wanted to see
the young fellow rise in the world. He
feared that his protege might be pre
vented from doing so by injuries received
on the football field.
Alexander Colt and Henry O. Plxley,
fellow students, accompany Hill to the
Philippines. The three were selected at
the recommendation of Professors^A- O.
Leuschner and Frank Soule. They will as
sist George Putnam and F. W. Edmonds,
engineers of the United States Coast and
Geodetic Survey. The three appointees
are members of the junior class in the
Engineering College. Their appointment
is for a year, with the option of continu
ing the work. They will each receive ?45
a month and found.
There is also gloom at Palo Alto. The
student body Is bewailing the probable
loss of Charles B. Raitt, its crack quarter
back. Raitt was suddenly summoned to
the bedside of his father, who is seriously
ill at his home in San Bernardino. Raitt's
absence from the big annual game would
be even a greater loss to the cardinal
than Hill's absence will be to California.
Raitt has been playing fine ball all season
and had the quarterback position
"cinched." He ran his team with the
skill of a "Daly" and knew his signals
.nd the possibilities of his men as no one
>n the field, unless it was Coach Yost.
The Stanford students hope that the
father of Raitt will quickly recover, so
the sturdy quarterback may rejoin hl3
comrades at the training table. In the
event Railt cannot return the important
duties of quarterback will devolve on
"Billy" Erb. The latter has been doing
great work at half. He is perfectly fa
miliar with the position and passes the
ball with accuracy.
Lean Will Not Train California.
The football eleven of the University of
California will not have the watchful care
of Trainer Al Loan thiÂ« season before the
all-important championship game on
Thanksgiving day. Through the efforts of
the Alumni Association Lean was engaged
to condition the men, as 'he had done for
four years past. All seemed well until
Lean had a conference with Reno Hutch
inson, manager of the football team.
They differed at once on some questions
as to the methods to be employed in the
conditioning of the team.
Lean, with his wide practical knowledge
of the needs of the men, would not ac
cept the views of Hutchlnson and an
nounced he would not be identified in any
manner with the handling of the Berke
leyans. This is considered a distinct loss
to the team, as men handled by Lean are
usually able to withstand the hardest of
knocks without sustaining severe injuries.

QTTTE the most peculiar Incident?
In connection with the racing at
Oakland yesterday, aside from
the victory of nve straight favor
ites, was the unexpected Ions
price laid against Saum Hlldreth's GoldÂ«.-n
Age in the dash for two-year-olds. The
son of Golden Garter was a powpr in the
far East, ihe pcalp oÂ«* Garry Hermann
and other' fast ones donRlingr at his bei'.
But it is paid the stable did not think him
ready. In consequence Bedeck came m
for liberal backing, and a world of 9 to 10
was obtainable about Hildreth'f- entry at
post time. Strang-e things happ<?n in rac
ing. Off in the lead and sprinting on
nearly equal terms. Dominick. astride
Andrattus. and "Monk" Coburn. piloting
Bedeck, left a yawning abyss for Buliman
to paf=f= between on entering the stretch.
Buliman failed to bite at the baits; but.
going around the pair, stepped over the
line a length and a r.alf ahead of tne
others, in 1:60 flat. Andrattus. carrying
only 103 pounds and displaying splondia
speed, downed Bedeck a neck for place
honors. When Golden Ag-e is ready lie
should be hard to beat-
None of the climatic conditions favored
the inhabitants of the ring, for the book
ies bumped against a "bloomer" at the
very commencement of things. Pat Mor
rlssey a 9 to 20 choice, won as he fancied,
and Jingle Jingle, with bells on. Jogged
Jrto second place, just as Â»ne bettors had
figured.
Miss RoTrena. the consistent and game
mare from the Bums & Waterhouse
stable, though asked lo carry 117 pounds
in the five aiid a half furlong dash, ruled
a â¬ to 5 choice over her field. She strolled
away in the lead, ana her backers never
felt "worried. Almoner finished well, lead
ir.Â£ out Matt Hogan for the place.
Then dainty Flush of Gold led her com
pany a stern chase in the mile and a six
teenth run. A 9 to 10 favorite. Lhe
daughter of Royal Flush ran under re
straints nearly the entire route. Tappan.
coming from the far lear, secured second
place from Expedient by a neck.
Little Dominick made Ja^3c Martin look
like an overdone ham-and-egsr sandwich
when it came to a finish in the mile and
a sixteenth selling affair. Jack, on Sir
Kingston, had been in front from flajgfal'..
and it took hard riding on the part of
Dominiek. with the leg up on Goldone, the
favorite, to catch him. Once on equal
terms Dominick outgeneraled and out
finished Martin, getting the decision by a
nose.

contained rifles and shotguns valued at
$S0O. The next day he returned to the
baggage-room and asked that the trunk
be shipped to Los Angeles, which was
Whitney appeared shortly after the
trunk had been shipped and demanded his

covered and the railroad detectives were
at once put to work to run down the
youthful crook. Through the efforts of

Bowler and Detective Tom Ryan of this
city, Eddo was arrested as he was, leav

When taken Into custody the boy crook
readily admitted his guilt. He was
brought to this city last night and locked
up in the tanks.
Eddo is also wanted for getting away
with about $100 worth of silverware from
a boy employed by Vandersllce & Co. The
silverware was purchased by C. F. Grif
fin, who lives at Twenty-fourth and Shot
well streets. A boy employed in the store
was given the package to deliver to Grif
fin and as he walked up Sutter street he
was followed by Eddo. In some way the
latter had learned that the package be
longed to Griffln. and walking up to the
boy, he represented that he was Griffln s
brother and offered to receipt for the
silverware. The boy gave him the pack

After a Varied Criminal Career.
YOUNG CROOK WITH REMARKABLE
RECORD LOCKED IN CITY PRISON
Locked up In the tanks at the City
Prison Is a seventeen-year-old boy, who,
according to the police, is one of tho most
daring crooks In the country. Hla name
Is Harry Eddo. Despite his tender years
he has committed at least a score of bold
crimes that would do "credit" to the most
experienced crook.
Eddo's home is In Connecticut. Last
January he ran away to New York, where
he Joined a notorious house-breaker and
assisted him In committing several
burglaries. He went to London and en
listed in the Royal Marines for service in
South Africa, but before the sailing of tho
transport deserted and stowed away on
the Bteamer Manhattan for New York.
After arriving there he committed several
burglaries and with the proceeds came to
th V S isUink a jewelry store on Market
street, near Seventh, he pretended that
he was anxious to buy some diamonds.
While the clerk iwas showing him some
precious stones Eddo managed to see the
name on a watch which had been left for
repairs. The following day he returned,
arid representing that he was the
brother of the owner of the watch, said
that the latter had sent him to get the
U The watch was delivered to him and It
was not until the real owner appeared
that the deception was discovered. Eddo
managed to work at least nine other
Jewelry dealers by similar means.
Last Friday the youthful crook went to
Sacramento. He had a small valise,
which he checked at the Sacramento depot.
While the baggagemaster's attention was
temporarily distracted Eddo stole the
check on a large trunk and substituted

"I may say that the relations between
the two roads are at the present time as
harmonious as those of any two compet
ing railroad companies in the country.
At the same time a break might occur
any day, although the sky at present la
quite clear."
Considerable Interest Is manifested lo
cally In a statement recently made In
New York by President Mellen of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, which was re
ported to be negotiating for the South
ern Pacific's Oregon lines. Mr. Mellen
says there is nothing to the story, and
adds:
"Mr. Hill, president of the Great North
ern, and I have had a conference and we
find that our ideas are much more similar
than we had supposed. We traveled on
the same car over the Northern Pacific
from Seattle to Butte, and from there on
we rode over the Great Northern.
Southern Pacific Property.
Mellen Says His Road Doesn't Want
NOT AFTER OREGON LINES.
"We have simply got to do something to
accommodate our constantly Increasing
patronage and the first step In that di
rection will be taken with the beginning
of next month, ; when an additional
through train between Chicago and this
city will be put on. This will give the
Santa Fe two trains a day into San Fran.
Cisco, also two to Los Angeles and three
as far as to Barstow. This additional
service ought to relieve present conditions
and will no doubt be appreciated by our
patrons."
Mr. Bissell was asked for an opinion as
to the rpobable outcome of the St. Louis
rate case, which comes up for final argu
ment before the Interstate Commerce
Commission In Washington December 10.
"Of course, as we look at it," replied
Mr. Bissell, ''there Is only one verdictâ a
verdict in favor of the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific. The St. Louis business
men In bringing this suit are attacking
existing conditions that cannot very well
be avoided."
The object of the suit Is to force the
overland lines to lessen their carload
rates so that Eastern firms can do a Job
bing business in the small towns of the
coast in competition with San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Portland, Tacoma and Seat
tle. The case is one of the most impor
tant that the commission has had to set
tle, exceeding in importance even the
routing case of the Southern California
Fruit Exchange against the Southern Pa

annual direct loss runs up into many millions of dol
lars, and the indirect losses are incalculable. ! No
section of the State is free from such disasters. Dur
ing- the dry season reports of- fires follow one an
other almost as regularly as "the days. We are per
mitting bur' great timber; resources to be burned up
without making; an intelligent effort to save them;
Such wastefulness ; and â¢ carelessness are unworthy of
a civilized people; and it is to be i hoped something
willbe done ; this winter to put an end to them. Â¦
DURING the warm days that followed the first
rains the woods of many parts of the State
became dry enough to furnish another illustra
tion of the urgent need of some system of forest pro
tection. These lessons come at a most opportune
time, for we are to have a Legislature in session this
winter, and it is well to have the importance of this
subject thoroughly impressed upon the public mind
so that the desired legislation may be adopted.
The dispatches of November 11 from San Diego
reported a forest fire raging in the mountains back
of El Cajon and threatening to devastate a wide re
gion of country. On the same day reports came of
another fire in a different locality of the same moun
tains. On November 12 dispatches^ from San Ber
nadino reported the destruction by fire of a lumber
mill, and added: "The further damage will be the
burning of the forest beyond the mill. The flames
are sweeping up the canyon, which is covered by
heavy' timber." On the same day came dispatches
* om Salinas ; announcing : "Forest fires are raging
in the foothills east of this city. Great damage has
been done. Already several thousand acres have-been
burned over."
FOREST FIRES AGAIN.
A cause of this kind needs no commendation. It
is probable that in the rich East it will not be diffi
cult to raise the sum desired for the fund, but it is
possible Californians may desire to contribute to it,
:tnd therefore, it is to be noted the announcement has
been made that all contributions should be sent di
iect to the treasurers, J. P. Morgan & Co., New
York; agreements for ' subscriptions payable at
a future date may be forwarded to W. * O. ; Holway,
secretary, 3 West Twenty-ninth street, New York.
It will be remembered that after the battle off San
tiago Rear Admiral Philip, whose ;hip had taken 1
distinguished part in the fight, assembled his crew
to join in thanksgiving for the victory and addressed
to them the memorable words, cheer, bovs
the poor fellows are dying." That phrase is destined
to live as long as men cherish noble sentiments 1 of
generosity in the hour of victory. It was significant
o-" the character of the man, and we proudly believe
it is alÂ«o significant of the character of the nation.
Hardly any claim now made upon the liberality
and patriotism of the American people is worthier
than this. Admiral Philip, after a service. of forty
years in the navy, during which time he upheld the
noblcsl ideals of American manhood, died rich in
honors but -poor in fortune. Th e pension of his
v iaow is said to be only $30 a month, a sum far from
sufficient for her wants even upon the humblest scale
of life, to say nothing of her dignity -as the widow
of an admiral of the rravy of the United States.
Q MOVEMENT has been started in the East to
y\ raise a fund of $100,000 for the double purpose
of providing for the widow of Rear Admiral
Philip and establishing a permanent memorial of the
hero himself. In ordtr to accomplish the double ob
ject it is the intention to invest the fund so that dur
ing the remainder of her life Mrs. Philip can have
the income, and after her death the revenue will be
dt voted to a seamen's home, where it will be known
as '"the Admiral Philip memorial fund."

A CHANCE VTO SMILE.
BY the action of the meeting at the Hopkins In
stitute of Art on Wednesday evening the Pa
cific Commercial Museum has taken another
step forward in that career which promises to speedily
realize many of the most sanguine expectations of its
founders and promoters. The resident Consuls of
various foreign Governments were at the meeting,
and through them the attention of their Governments
was called to the establishment of the museum and
the scope of its work. Thus the commercial activity
of the museum has been begun, and we may expect
ere long to sec something in the way of trade re
sults.
In this connection it will be worth while to note
efforts now being made in Boston to attract trade to
that city, as it may be of advantage to us to imitate
them so far as they are applicable to our conditions.
There is no commercial museum in Boston, but some
of the railroads centering in the city have perceived
the benefits, certain to accrue to them from increased
foreign trade at the port, and have had agents abroad
seeking to procure it.
Speaking of the work of one of these agents, Mr.
Crane, who has been traveling in Europe working
ur. trade for the city, the Boston Globe says?
"He visited not only London and Liverpool,
and Hamburg, Glasgow and Hull, but Rot
tci dam, Antwerp and Copenhagen. Direct re
sults of gratifying character were reached in
the assurance of an increase in steamship service to
Boston in the near future, and the likelihood of th?
speedy establishment of new lines of commerce hav
.ing Boston as the American terminal. From the
officials of the Rotterdam line, for instance, there is
already the promise. of a regular service to Boston of
three sailings a month. The Elder-Dempster service
will be improved as soon as opportunity offers, while
the 'Dominion Iin e is soon to receive "the accession of
a new steamer and must prove more efficient than
ever." .
Cheered by these promises Mr. Crane appears to
be quite sanguine that Boston may yet receive much
of the foreign trade that now goes to New York, and
consequently her railroads will obtain the traffic that
has helped to enrich the New York, roads. 1 He is
quoted as having said: "Owners who are looking
around for profitable routes for their steamers are
also coming to understand that if is much better to
send their: tonnage to the second important port on
the Atlantic, where steamers can sail right up to the
dock and find plenty of room, than to send their ships
to New York," where, to begin with, they find compet
ing^ lines ahead of them and will have to fairly fight
for s. chance to dock their vessels."
In. those statements there is a lesson which rail-

The investigation which the Board of Supervisors
is now making into the financial affairs of the Spring
Valley Water Company indicates that the corporation
is conveniently ignorant of the value of its own prop
erties. It would be reasonable to suppose, therefore,
that it would not object if the public took advantage
of the same convenience if the time ever comes to
make the municipal acquisition of public utilities a
rtality.
Thct purpose is understood to be the storing of
storm waters for distribution to the irrigable soil ;o
make it fertile, open it for settlement and furnish a
field for occupancy by our citizens, who in agricul
ture can found independent homes', draw their sup
port from the soil and add to the country's surplus
for export to the food consumers of the world.
Collateral to the subject of irrigation is forestry,
the preservation of our timber area and its. extension
by planting, and the restoration of its vegetable cover
to tlic grazing area by renewal of the natural forage
which has been destroyed by overgrazing, due to
occupancy of the range in common by herdsmen
and flock-masters.
Addresses will be delivered to the congress by Mr.
Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture; General Miles of
the army; Senators Foster, Carter, Beveridge and
Perkins; and by business men such as Charles A.
Mallory, A. C. Bartlett, George F. Stone, J. J. Hill
of the Great Northern, and John E. Springer,
president of the National Livestock Association.
It is estimated that 75,000,000 acres of land may
be made fruitful by irrigation. That is 470,748 quarter
sections, capable of supporting a population of 2,353,
740 people. Such an addition to the producing and
consuming power is of great importance, but it does
not represent all the results of irrigation and the for
est and range policies which are impinged upon it.
Leasing the ranges and preservation of the forests
mean the sustenance of many more millions of
people.
All the West will look with interest for the conclu
sions reached by this congress.
The congress will consider the whole irrigation
question as affecting the country -.vest of the ninety
ninth meridian, and will continue to urge such meas
ures of local and general legislation as will forward
the purpose of the promoters of the congress.
THE first session and organization of the Irriga
tion Congress occurred at Salt Lake City. The
ninth session will be held in Chicago on the

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A contrast of that kind cannot be put aside lightly
as a mere accidental occurrence. The New York
demonstration, being of a partisan character, might
have been expected to occasion fights here and there
between pugnacious supporters of different parties,
but nothing of the kind occurred; while the Lon
don celebration, being of a patriotic character, ought
to have been thoroughly good-humored and har
monious, but it was the reverse. The most notable
point of contrast, however, is the revelation of the
attitude of the men of the two cities toward women
who joined them in the. frolic. In New York the ap
pearance of the women on the streets kept the crowds
orderly and respectful, but in London the opposite
happened.' We can feel a just national pride in this
evidence of American manliness and rejoice in the
knowledge that it is. not in New York only that such
respect for womanhood is displayed on all occasions.
The excitement In the streets, particularly from Fleet
street to Piccadilly, last night surpasses anything yet
experienced. Even Mafeking night, though perhaps more
boisterous, was not equal to this volume of surging hu
manity. Unfortunately there was only too much of that
unseemly horseplay which threatens to become an un
governable factor on such occasions. The hope is ex
pressed that London has grown weary of this kind of
festivity, and that" it will die out soon. It is sincerely
to bo trusted that thlshope has justification in fact. The
drunkennes'a among women and young girls was a par
ticularly noticeable and deeply regrettable phase of
the street scenes. Enormous throngs surged along Fleet
street, the Strand. Piccadilly, 'Praed street and the Edg
ware road, flying peacocks' feathers, beating respectable
pergons with bladders Btrung on strings and sticks, roar
ing out the coarsest of songs and indulging in wantofi
ribaldry. The well behaved who came out to see the
decorations and Illuminations had to suiter at the hands
of these riotous Individuals.
This brings us to a notable feature of the celebration
âthe vast number of women who took part in it, vying
with the men, the college boys and the street urchins
in blowing horns and megaphones, swinging rattles and
waving flags and campaign devices. With few excep
tions, too, they were obviously respectable women, most
ly young, but includingalso many of matronly appear
ance and not a few crowned with the dignity of gray
hairs. It was a great spreÂ© and these women, making
up probably a quarter or a third of the crowds, were as
demonstrative in their, enjoyment of it as were the
men themselves. A contagious spirit of comradeship
prevailed among them and the conventional feminine re*
serve was cast aside for a liberty of Intercourse which
was not abused. They were like boys out for a frolic,
? â¢ â¢ "What was the consequence? Was not the prev
alent good temper and considerate behavior of the
crowds directly due to the presence of so great a num
ber of women, many unaccompanied by men and many
others with such escort? At any rate, In all that boister
ous crowd and that wild frolic there was no clash of
rude and coarse behavior. Political enmities were for
gotten in the prevalent spirit pf fun. Nor were the high
spirits manifested the product of artificial stimulants,
except in small measure; yet never and nowhere has
there been more complete abandonment to merrymaking
than there was by the men and women who thronged
Broadway from Twenty-third to *Forty-second street on
election night. Evidently women have come out of the
seclusion of homes to share in the tumultuous frolic of
men; and if the -consequence Is always to be as it was
on election night. It will be goodâ certainly for the men.
The Westminster Gazette in describing the wel
come of the City Volunteers in London says:
That the contrast may be fairly presented we give
accounts as published in papers of the two cities, and
written by reporters who were eye-witnesses of the
facts. The New York Sun in describing the celebra
tion of the McKinley victory in that city says:
I 1â m.
LONDON recently celebrated by a popular out
burst of delight the return of the City Impe
rial Volunteers from the war in South Africa,
and New York a few days later had a similar demon
stration over the great victory for McKinley and
prosperity. In both cities the streets were thronged
with tumultuous* crowds, and v it was noted that" a
considerable number of women shared in the uproar
and took the jostling with a frolic welcome.
There was, however, a wide difference between the
tone of the two celebrations and a wider difference
in the manner in which the women of the two citie3
acted and were treated. The contrast is so striking as
to be worthy of note as an illustration of the national
characteristics of Americans and Britons as displayed
in great crowds.
e TALE OF TWO CITIES.
The latest reports from China indicate that the
allied powers are now most pressingly concerned
with the serious problem of how, after having forced
an entrance into the Orient, it is easiest and safest
to get out. .
There will be a simple funeral, yet It
will be the grandest yet held by the Gypsy
nation. According to the rites of the Gyp
sies, a prince of the royal and reigning
dynasty must be buried in royal ground.
As the Gypsies have no reservations In
Chicago cemeteries, the funeral will be In
the country, but where the leaders would
not Bay.
A canvass of the nation brought out an
accordion and a violin and a player for
each. By the flare of torches there were
dances such as are frequently seen only
in Sicily and along the Mediterranean
shores.
While the death may terminate the pres
ent dynasty in the rule of the nation, the
Gypsies were none the less glad that the
royal child had been spared the trials of
a nomadic existence similar to the one
they themselves are leading. The mother
rejoiced that her child had been spared
those tribulations, but the mother's heart
compelled her to weep.
Prince Leon, heir presumptive to the
throne of Stanley, King of the Gypsies, Is
dead.says the writer of a recent article
in a Chicago newspaper. His body lies in
stateâ all the state which can be gathered
about a small bier In a miserable hovel In
the throneroom of the Gypsy nation at
Forty-seventh street and Archer avenue.
The Prince, a tot of five years, was try
ing to feed a fire In the cook stove of his
mother, the Queen and consort of King
Stanley, his father, when the paper car
ried the flre to his imperial kilt robes and
ignited them. Before her Majesty, the
Queen, could reach him from the fortune
telling booth. which she occupied he had
been fatally burned.
There was no sadness In the Gypsy na
tion last night. No remorse.. save in the'
mother's heart, was felt for the dead.
Their theosophy taught them to 'believe
that he^had gone to a happier life, and
they unselfishly rejoiced.

NEW YORK WORLD-^It will strike us
as strange that after the long straggle for
electoral reform Great Britain, with a
population of nearly 4D.CO0.00O. can cast
only 4,31tJt703 votes. From this it would
appear that fully one-haif of the Briti3n
freemen are still disfranchised. And while
the average vote required to choose a

are still boroughs with only S000 voters,
while in other election districts there is a

PHILADELPHIA LEDGERâ Some edu
cators encourage self-depreciation in the
child, whereas he needs the assurance
that he is well worth improving and en
nobling. He can easily be led either to
self-contempt or to self-respect, and may
soon learn to distinguish what tends to
the one from what tenda to the other. To
be convinced that mean action is beneath
him is a great safeguard: no one wishes
to sink, and the sense of honor is a con

roads having terminals in San- fcrancisco ought to
find profitable. If the comparatively [Â¦ small lines
which center in Boston find it worth their while to
work up* the foreign trade of the city at their own
expense, surely the Santa Fe arid the Southern Pa
cific can perceive an advantage to themselves in co
operating with the Commercial Museum in promot
ing trade with this port. It is a good thing to have
called the attention of foreign Consuls to the work
the museum has undertaken, but.it would be bette.^
to deal with merchants and traders direct. The Bos-'
ton plan has had good results there, and Would doubt
less be equally profitable here..
If this be so, Germany should be undeceived. The
people of this country want peace in China. They
want the integrity of that empire preserved. They
v.-ant the open door through which to reach its trade,
and other nations may as well be informed that this
country will not permit the ignoring of its rights in
these particulars, though reached round-about by
contempt for the rights of China.
He may be merely the agent of the hidden purpose
of other Continental Governments besides his own.
He may not be acting on his own initiative. It may
be that Germany is encouraged by the unchristian
expressions of American missionaries, who have been
in the Middle Kingdom by virtue of the forgery of
the treaty of i860, and so may be proceeding upon the
theory that American sentiment does not back up the
administration of the country in its humane and pa
cific views.
All of this prospect of permanent peace on a basis
that China can assent to without destruction of her
self-respect is destroyed in the germ by the merely
ruffianly course of Von Waldersee.
Americans protest, to a man, against this making
of offensive warfare while diplomacy is trying to se
â¢:ure peace. We have entered into negotiations with
China, and that alone is an admission of the right of
that nation to speak for itself and to be heard with
respect. On any other basis negotiation is a farce.
Distasteful as occupation of any part of another
country may be to us, we may be compelled to insist
on a legation guard at the Chinese capital in order
that our Minister may not be again exposed to the
danger that beset him from June until August. But
the necessity for such guard will disappear if Peking
be made an open city, in the same sense as the treaty
ports. If the negotiating nations proceed on the line
of reason, and with the purpose of doing justice to
China while exacting it from her, there is no doubt
that this open policy could be finally .secured.
Von Waldersee's present course in sending out
what he calls "punitive expeditions" to raid the coun
try and murder non-combatants is a crime comparable
only with the original Boxer outrages. It is an in
sulting defiance of the known policy of the United
States and is intended to make impossible of accom
plishment the world's desire for peace in China, and
on terms that will not be a reproach to the Western
nations.
Before the Count embarked from Germany for the
sceneof his duties the reduction of Peking was over,
the legations were relieved and the whole issue was
shifted from the military to the diplomatic stand
point. Negotiations for settlement were on, and any
further military aggression became wanton and
malicious, calculated to impede a settlement and im
peril that peace which is the object of the pour parler
into which the nations have entered with China.
GOUNT VON WALDERSEE is in China at all
only as the commander in chief of the allied
forces, which marched to the reduction of Pe
king and the rescue of the legations. The powers,
joined in that emergency, felt the need of a common
action and that the expedition should have one head.
The French commander was a* half-caste negro, and
there were objections to him. Japan waived her right
to ask supreme command for her very able field mar
shal, who was on the ground and in command of her
excellent army. So, finally, it was settled that a Ger
man officer should take command, and the Kaiser
named Von Waldersee, who was accepted by the al
lies. Instead of proceeding to his post of duty and
taking command of the relief column he remained on
exhibition in Germany, catching and throwing bou
quets and mistreating the spirit in which his com
mand had been accepted by the other nations. That
acceptance was no admission of the superiority of
German military organization, and it was not cour
tesy to so treat it. Yet it. was treated in that spirit,
which was a distinct affront to the assenting powers.

ern Italy arose tho Cisalpine republic,
south of the Po; the Clspadane republic,
and from the wreck of the old Govern
ment of Genoa the IJgurlan republic. At
tho opening of the next year the rule of
the Pope gives place to a Roman repub
lic, revived and organized with fidelity to
the classical model of old Rome, and tho
year following the Parthenopaean repub
lic was established at Naples, comprising
the mainland territory of the Kins of tha
two Sicilies.
Although these republics were short
lived, it was this wholesale parceling and.
reassembling of the Italian states that
kindled the flame of an Italian patriotism
and planted the seed of Italian unity. In
union only could Italians effectually resist
foreign oppressors. The idea of a single
Italian republic, advocated by enlightened,
leaders as early aa 1796, gradually filters
down among the people. No doubt the
tremendous energy and power displayed
by the French republic in Its great strug
gle against the European coalition con
tributed to this result.
In dismembering Venice, too, with aa
little compunction as Prussia and Russia
had felt toward Poland, Bonaparte left
the Italians no illusions in regard to his
policy that would mislead them to rely
on any onj but themselves for seeming
their freedom. The policy of creating a
protective fringe of republics around
France was extended to Switzerland,
where a confederation of states with
much that was feudal and aristocratic in
their constitution was melted Into a
single centralized republic, modeled after
the government of Franca.
The continued activity of the French In
Italy after the treaty of Campo Formio
and the absence of Bonaparte on tho
Egyptian expedition offered the provoca
tion and the opportunity for a new coali
tion against France. The results of the
war that followed on political geography
were Inconsiderable outside of Ger
many. After the battles of Hohen
linden and Marenso, Bonaparte was able
to exact a treaty (Luneville. W)l) from the
Emperor, which retained the essentials of
the treaty of Campo Formio and was in
addition made binding on the empire. It
was no slight humiliation for the Roman
Emperor of the German nation, the em
bodiment of monarchy, to have to Join
with France in guaranteeing the Bata
vlan. Helvetian, Cisalpine and LIgurlan
republics. The Roman and Partheno
paean republics were not revived. In
Tuscany the short-lived kingdom of Etru
ria was erected for the Duke of Parma,
the son-in-law and nephew of the Kins
and Queen of Spain, in compensation for
the compulsory cession to Franca of
Louisiana tho year before.
The treaty of Amiens negotiated with
England In 1S02 brought peace to Europe
after ten years of war (1792-1SQ2). but tha

by absorbing: the city republics, which
are thereby "mediatized"â L e., deprived
of their former position of immediate de
pendence on the Emperor, 'which was sub
stantial independence.
The first results of tha war as seen In
political geography were the conquest
and annexation (1792) of the Austrian
Netherlands (Belgium) and the opening of
the river Scheldt to trade. The Â¦ naviga
tion of this river, on which the great
commercial city of Antwerp is situated,
had been prohibited by the treaty of
Westphalia in 1643 as a concession to the
United Netherlands In the Interests of
the commerce of Rotterdam and Amster
dam. In the south, Savoy and Nice wel
comed the entry of French troops, and
the hold of their ancient rulers was
broken. By the opening of 1795 the
French armies were in possession of the
left bank of the Rhine, from Basle to the
North Sea, and the republic found itself
confronted with the problem of expan
sion. A war for humanity had resulted
in conquests and the question arose what
should be done with them. In the midst
of the discussion a member of the con
vention was commissioned to inspect the
lands and to learn the wishes of the peo
ple. He gave a glowing report of the In
dustrial resources and the strategic Im
portance of the territory, and the French
readily believed that the inhabitants were
In favor of incorporation with France.
The pregnant theory of ' "natural boun
daries" now makes its first appearance in
history and the Rhine and the Alps are
declared the "natural . boundaries" of
France.
During this discussion. in regard to the
rightfulness and expediency of annexing
those territories* the treaty of Basle with
Prussia had been -concluded (June. 1795).
Prussia had heen easily induced to relin
quish her claims to her small territories
on the left bank of the Rhine and to
recognize the river as the natural boun
dary of France, provided she were as
sured Indemnification, with some ecclesi
astical states east of the Rhine. The
next year the bishopric of Munster was
agreed upon as the compensation to Prus
sia. The provision of the treaty of
Basle was secret.
The most significant provision of the
treaty, however, so far as Germany was
concerned, was the separation of the em
pire into two parts by a line of- demarca
tion. The states or the empire north,
roufrhly speaking; of the forty-ninth
parallel and of the boundaries of Bavaria
and Bohemia, were to share with Prussia
in the peace, while those south of the lino
were left exposed to attack as *ong as the
war should continue with Austria. ThN
division of the empire Into two parts, one
attached to Austria and the other to
Prussia, was a premonition of its disrup
tion and of that course of events which
seventy years later should culminate In
the North German confederation. Such
an ominous move galvanized Into tempo
rary life the Bentiment of German unity,
and a storm of pamphlets issued from the
press denouncing: the selfish and treason
ably policy of Prussia and declaring a
separate peace perjury to Emperor and
empire.
By' the treaty of The Hague Holland
was stripped of he* territory south of the
Meuse except Zealand and transformed
Into a democratic republic, a pendant and
an ally of France. After following In the
wake of England for a century, her for
tunes for twenty years are now linked
with those of France. "With Belgium an
nexed and Holland under control, tho po
sition of France toward England was Im
mensely strengthened, and the" triumphant
republic; having fulfilled the dreams of
Richelieu and Louis XIV In Kurope, re
solved to ; repair the losses of Louis XV
in America; and demanded, from Spain
Louisiana. The dexterous Godoy was ablo
to parry the stroke by yielding the Span
ish part of San Domingo, which waa ac
cepted as a useful preliminary step to the
greater object. .
Within two years the terrific blows of
Bonaparte brought Austria to her knees,
while the campaigns in Germany had
forced the smaller South German states
to seek for terms by themselves.
In the treaty of Camoo Formio Austria
follows I the example of Prussia and con
cludes an . Individual . peace, leaving to a
congress to discuss the conditions of peacs
between France and the empire. Like
Prussia, too; Austria assents to the estab
lishment of the Rhine as the boundary of
Prance, thus recognizing the Â¦ annexation
of Belgium and receiving as an Indemnity
the city of .Venice and the portion of her
territory east of, the Adiee and north of
the Po.with Istria and Dafmatla. The Em

The Pennsylvania Limited Repre
sents the Cost of Several
â¢ '.< Fine Farms.
r
AH the Conveniences of a Modern
Palatial Residence. .
Few people have a correct Idea of the enor
mous investment represented by a train of
cars. One passenger coach costs as much as a
comfortable home, while the price of a sleep
ing car exceeds that of a palatial residence.
Even the ordinary freight car Is worth con
siderable money, and the usual string of them
represents the value of a large farm. Loco
motives cost well up In thousands of 'dollars,
and Individuals who have never given the
subject any thought will be surprised at the
figures. .
The highest grade of train service In j the
world is maintained on .the Pennsylvania
lines. Coaches used on this vast system do
not cost less than $3000 each. Every part,
metal and wood, is carefully selected and put
together by experts in car building. Ten thou
sand dollars Is certainly a large sum to Invest
In one car. but that amount represents thÂ«
price of a sleeping car.
The equipment of a through train. In ad
dition to the locomotive, usually consists of a
baggage car, an express car and a fast mail
car, followed by a 'compartment parlor smok
ing car, coaches and sleeping cars. Only the
best locomotives,* strong and marvelous pieces
of mechanism, run over the Pennsylvania
lines, and each costs fully {10.000. The bag
gage, express and mall cars are each worth
several thousand dollars; the coaches one
half as much as the locomotive, and the Pull
mans the same as the locomotive, making the
value of a regular train exceed $00,000.
But a $50,000 investment is small when com
pared to tha outlay required to place In
service one train running over the Pennsyl
vania lines. This train, the world-famous
Pennsylvania Limited, Is composed exclusively
of Pullman cars of the highest degree of mag
nificence, and is the most luxurious and most
costly train In service in the world. The money
Invested In It will buy a dozen fine farms.
Persons who' travel on the Pennsylvania
Limited have an opportunity to see to what
extent genius and skill have developed rail
way transportation facilities. The character
and comforts of this famous train represent
the highest standard of excellence attained In
the art of car. construction. The combination
parlor, smoking and library car, the Initial
link of this chain of vestibuled luxury, is
practically a metropolitan club on wheels, com
prising the dolce far niente smoker, buffet and
library, equipped with plush, leather and wil
low loungers, corner cheffonlers supplied with
embossed stationery, card sections, barber shop
and bath, all done in mahogany and gold relief
and damask draperies. -Electric buttons at every
elbow, and ubiquitous attendants emphasize the
club-like convenience.
The second link Is the dining car, mahogany
mirrored, the canopy a dream of decorations in
relief, subdued by stained-glass transoms and
silken window blinds. The snowy tables,
gleaming silver, glinting cut glass, dainty
wares and tempting menus are particularly in
viting. The bill of fare embraces every con
ceit in and out of season. It were superfluous
to say more.
Two drawing-room sleeping cars of the pro
nounced Pullman type follow the dining . car.
Then comes the latest. Pullman triumph â the
compartment sleeping car. with private rooms
and suites, containing lockers, shelves and in
dividual lavatory arrangements, and affording
all the privacies of home. The new compart
ment car. In fact, has provided American tour
ists with all the privileges and pleasures of a
private or special car. The Pennsylvania Lim
ited compartment cars are not only Improve
ments on those exploited at the World's Fair,
but they are finished In still richer woods, dra
peries and carpets. Two spacious drawing
rooms en suite occupy the ends of these cars
boudoir staterooms between, alternating in
woods and colors as to their finish and fur
nishings.
~ The last car of the Pennsylvania Limited Is
the combination drawing-room, parlor and ob
servatory, the two latter-named appointments
comprising the social rendezvous of the passen
gers en route, where frequent fast friendships
are formed, and the "highest types of American
travelers come into casual contact. The library
and the observatory apartments are provided
with the latest : literature, including the stand
ard monthlies and weeklies and dallies of the
principal cities. Writing desks and society em
bossed stationery, are likewise provided in both
apartments, with typewriters and telegraphers
available, and mall-boxes in reach, mail being
collected en route.

he emigrated to Missouri and engaged In
farming in Franklin County, his land
holdings being extensive.
About thirty-five years ago Me. Apper

â¢ Plans for readjusting the Congressional
and Legislative districts of California will
engage the attention of the Republican
caucus- of the incoming Legislature.
Should it be deemed advisable the Equal
ization Railroad districts may be changed
by the Legislature. The chief interest of
the apportionment for the next decade
will attach to the readjustment of Con
gressional district boundaries. Every pol
itician who aspires to a seat in Congress,
as well aa every member" of Congress
elect, has an apportionment scheme. The
caucus will find the task of pleasing the
politicians a most difficult one, but the
people will be satisfied with a plain, sim
ple apportionment, in which constitutional
requirements of equality as regard* popu
lation and compactness of contiguous As
sembly districts shall be recognized.
There cannot be much juggling bo far as
San Francisco is concerned, because the
constitution (section 27, article 4) says:
Bee. 27. When a Congressional district shall
be composed of two or more counties it shall
not be separated by any county belonging to
another district. No county, or city and county,
shall be divided in forming a Congressional
district so as to attach one portion of a county
or city and county to another county or city
and county, except in caaea where one county,
or city and county, has more population than
the ratio required for one or more CongreeB*
men; but the Legislature may divide any
county, or city and county, into as many Con
gresalonal districts as it may be entitled to
by law. Any county, or city and county, con
taining a population greater than the number
required for one Congressional district, shall
be formed Into one or more Congressional ills
trlcts, according to the population thereof, a*id
any residue alter forming such district, or dis
tricts, shall be attached, by compact adjoining
Assembly districts, to a contiguous county or
counties, and form a Congressional district.
In dividing a county, or city and county, into
Congressional districts no Assembly District
Â¦hall be divided so as to form Â»â¢. part of more
than one Congressional district, and every
such Congressional . district shall be composed
of compact contiguous Assembly districts.
It is the impression of leading politi
cians that Congress, in providing the ap
portionment under toe new census, will
not increase the numerical strength of the
House of Representatives. The number
will probably remain as it is and the ratio
of population be increased. San Francisco
has not a population sufficient to entitle
her to two Representatives in Congress.
Los Angeles County falls short of the
requisite number of inhabitants for one
member. For purposes of representation
in the Legislature the Chinese population
cannot be reckoned. Thia practically de
prives San Francisco of one Senator and
two Assemblymen. In computing for Con
gressional representation the Legislature
has the right to include the Chinese pop
ulation.
"Will Receive the Banner.

liance Club of Oakland will bring to this

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1900.
This treaty sounded the knell of thÂ«
holy Roman empire, and made its disso
lution only a question of time. The deg
radation of Germany was complete when
the empire was recognized as the com
mon spoil of Austria and France. The
process by which it was to be swallowed
up is so clearly stipulated in the seventh
of the secret articles that it must be
quoted: "It Is understood between the
two contracting: powers that If. in ar
ranging the pending peace with the Ger
man empire, the French republic shall
make an acquisition in Germany, his Ma
jesty the Emperor. King of Hungary and
of Bohemia, shall obtain an equivalent
there and conversely, it his royal and im
perial Majesty makes an acquisition of
this kind, the French republic shall simi
larly receive an equivalent" Article
twelve, too. provided that the different
princes and states of the empire which,
should suffer losses of territory in conse
quence of this treaty or the one with' tha
empire should obtain "appropriate in
demnities in Germany." No wonder Na
poleon wrote: "If the German empire did
not exist it would have been necessary to
create it expressly for our advantage. A
sentiment the Emperor might echo, for
Austria, defeated in five campaigns,
emerged with territories enlarged and
compacted, and provided with access to
the sea by the Adriatic
In Italy the changes were no 1ms mo
mentous. Bonaparte broke loose from the
control of the Directory and silenced oppo
sition by the success of his campaigns
and the richness of the plunder he sent
back. The Directory were satisfied with
the results of the peace of Basle and did
not design the wholesale reconstruction of
Italy, but Bonaparte conceived the plan
of protecting the territory of France by
an outer line of buffer states, "sister re
publics," and from the states of North-
The war which broke out in 1732 be
tween revolutionary France and . Austria
after the establishment of the French re
public in September of that year took
on the aspect of a crusade for liberty.
On November 19 this decree was Issued:
"The national convention declares in the
name of the French nation that it will
assist and recognize as brethren all peo
ples who want their liberty, and charges
the executive to give the generals the
necessary orders to . assist these peoples
and to defend citizens who have been or
are likely to be maltreated for the cause
of liberty." In less than a month this
offer of assistance becomes compulsory
and peoples whose lands are occupied by
French troops must be given a French
and a republican administration whether
they want it or not.
In the face of such a policy every mon
arch in Europe felt threatened and in
secure. Old Europe confronted the revo
lution, massed its forces for resistance,
but was forced to bend to the storm,
which cleared the ground of much vener.
able rubbish, sweeping clean out of exist
ence the ecclesiastical states of Germany
and hundreds of its petty sovereigns.
Repeatedly we see AuBtrla and Prussia
rising from defeat with enlarged terri
tories. This curious result came about
by the peculiar process of transformation
in the empire represented by the words,
"indemnification, "secularization" I and
"medlatizatlon." If Prussia or Austria
lose provinces contiguous to France they
indemnify themselves by annexing some
of the smaller states of the empire.
Again the secular princes indemnify
themselves by acquiring ecclesiastical
states, which are thereby ''secularised," or

! CHICAGO. Nov. lB.-At the beginning of the
j tension the talent beheld a paradox, the market
J steadying on bearish news. Liverpool fully
I reflected the decline here yesterday and short*
1 taking advantage of the liquidation which was
renewed in a moderate way on this fact cov
ered to insure profits. Thus December, which
had opened Jie lower at 72%c to ,72V4c. rallied
I to ,2Â»Â»c. This brought out more wheat, with
j the result that December dropped to 71?ic the
1 low price for the day. Here the market gave
j evidence of having been sold to the last specu â¢
, latlve- bushel and prices steadied with a Jerk.
The long wheat which shorts had grabbed at
the start was less In evidence. An Argentine
cable reported forty pÂ«r cent damage to the
crop of that country, and while this was de
nied by others later, lt had its effect among
rhorts. The opening of recently closed mills
at Minneapolis also had Us effect, and Decem
ber advanced to 72=K,@729ie, around which fig
ures the market held steady the remaining
hour of the session.
Corn was able to stand alone and did so.
helped by a good shipping demand and stiff
backed attitude maintained by a younr opera
tor c-edlted with being In control of the mar
ket. December closed a shade higher at 35ftÂ®
26c.
Oats w*re quiet and firm. December closed
unchanged at 22c.
Strength and fair amount of acttvlty held
sway In the provisions pit. Packers and com
mission houses were liberal buyers, largely to
cover shorts. The market was Influenced by a
run of hogs 7000 under the estimate, nnd a
Fharp advance In prices at the stockyards.
January pork closed 32V4c over yesterday; lard
He higher and ribs 20c up.

NEW YORK. Nov. IS.â Etrength was renewed
In the etock market to-day, but there Â»Â«
nothing like a resumption of the speculative
enthusiasm of last week. Th~re were ctockk
that moved strongly upward yesterday anj
there were fewer that cloeed the day lower
than they left off last night, but thÂ«re waj
nevertheless a continuance of the ii regular
tendency In the market. The points of stienistn
though more numerous, were still someÂ»n*{
Isolated or deserted and the market <Md not
at any time show permeating and vigorous
etrength. The gains seemed to be due eithrr
to the operations of speculative pools working
for an advance in fip*-clal stocks or to cauoea
affecting the Individual stocks. General Elec
tric duplicated 1U rain of yesterday with an
other 6-polnt riÂ«e. carrying It to 160% on thÂ«
large earnings reported. Yesterday's strength
In the coaler* became largely localized in New
Jersey Central, which was up at one time 4>4
points on reports of coming Increase in divi
dends. The movement of broadest scope for
the day was In the winter wheat grangers,
which advanced between. 1 and 2 points oil
e round on good weather fpr thÂ« crop in that
territory. The movement 'In Sreat Northern
preferred and Union Pacific was attributed to
reports of a working agreement looking tÂ«,
extension of traffic In each other's territory.
Northern Pacific, after a Blight advance, fÂ»il
back to about last night's level. Consolidated
U11, Continental Tobacco, People's Gu. Ten
nessee Coal, nrooklyn Transit and some other
*l*Â»cialtJes were etrcng In the same way. Lon
don bought a email number of stocks on bat
enoe. The professional pressure against the
tnarket was relaxed and there were no furtner
r'.gns of urgent liquidation, although profit
taking was In evidence at *ome points all
daj*. Money was appreciably easier and a
favorable bank statement Saturday is begin
ning to be discounted. " The sub-treasury oper
ations have contributed about 1500,000 to the
market by reason of the falling off In internal
revenue collections and large disbursement for
I -melons. There have been light currency ship
ments to New" Orleans, but Chicago exchange
rose to par to-day. Reports from interior
money markets are of easy conditions, due to
a process cf unloosening after the election
similar to that which occurred In the New
York market. Arrivals of over {3,000,000 In
Australian gold are expected In San Francisco
In a few days, which can bÂ« made available

CLOSING.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
1 he markets here were again fairly astlva to
day. It Is now rumored that the Government
borrowings have been postponed until next
year, when presumably the condition of the
money markets will be more favorable to the
fetation of a large issue. This, lt Is reported,
Â¦will tfcke the form of a Transvaal loan. Amer
icans opened dull under parity on the news of
the Czar's illness, which caused some depres
sion, but Berlin buying again set the ball roll
ing. New York bought in the afternoon and
the. close was good, though under the best.
Northern Pacific and Baltimore and Ohio were
yery lively. The former was bought in well
informed quarters and lt la generally believed
here that eome Important deal is pending. Call
money was in strong demand and was very
n rrn. ThÂ« bank reports a good business in
short loans. Berlin exchange was lower at
London Market.

If ants give us an example of Industry

The California Society of. the Sons of
the American Revolution gave a banquet
last night at the Merchants* Club ln cele
bration of the one hundred and twenty
third anniversary of the agreement to the
articles of confederation. Women graced
the occasion with their presence, and song
and the wit and eloquence of famous post
prandial speakers made It memorable.
William H. Jordan presided and acted
as toast master. The banquet began at
6:30 o'clock. and at 9 o'clock Mr. Jordan
began his introductory remarks. Mrs.
John Madden sang "My Dreams," by
Tostl. The banqueters, charmed by tho
exquisite purity and sympathy of her
voice, demanded an encore, and she sang
"Take Me, Jamie."
Mr. Jordan read a letter of regrets from
Van R, Paterson, who was to have spoken
on "Conf deration to Nation." The toast
master said he had since learned that
Judge Paterson's Illness was serious and
fear was- felt that he would not recover.
General W. H. L. Barnes spoke with his
usual eloquence on "American Citizen
ship." Once he lapsed into politics and
received apparently unanimous applause.
He said in part:
Truly when the American citizen looks about
him and sees this magnificent country with Its
76,000,000 of free men and not a serf among
them not a town without its school, not a
home without its fireside of hope and faith, his
heart may well be fired with patriotism. We
go back through all our country's history of
achievement and It Is the source of our grand
est and greatest pride and happiness.
I have never doubted the average common
sense, of the American people. We have too
many school houses, too many churches, to let
any man this side of Lincoln. Nebr.. doubt this
common sense. The political flght has ended.
If we can realize that we have been ln a nght,
and the people have spoken. The result of this
contest has been worth more to America than
the victory of Dewey at Manila or of Samp
eon and Bchley at Santiago. It has told the
world that this nation moves upon the lines
of sound money, of political good faith, of na
tional honor and responsibility.
Robert Lloyd sang the prologue of
"Pagliaccl" and responded to an en
thusiastic encore. Â¦
Judge John Hunt spoke of the Influ
ences of Colonial Dames," and his ad
dress, adorned with wit and with grace
ful tributes to woman's influence, was ln
many respects the feature of the evening.
Rev Bradford Leavitt. Â¦ speaking on
"The Old Days and the New." made a
plea for high living. Ho said In conclu
sion:
"What the nation needs is more men of a
contemplative spirit, more men who have
tlmo. ft Is a shame for a man to have no hap
piness but in money, to acknowledge that he has
no time for other thinss than business. If
year by year you are conquering these ma
terial . tendencies", you are preparing a tran
quillity of soul which after all is the only thing
for which you have occasion to be thankful.
Mrs. Madden and Mr. Lloyd sang a
duet, "Repeat Again," by Badia. The
closing address was made by Commander
F. J. Drake, United States navy, on "The
American Navy of the Revolution."
PAY TRIBUTE
TO FOREFATHERS
A convention of California oil miners
was held last evening In the assembly
rooms of the Mills building, at which two
important decisions were reached. The
first was to fix the commission to be paid
to brokers engaged by the California Pe
troleum Miners' Association to sell stocks
of the companies at 10 per cent. The sec
ond was to authorize Colonel L. P. Crane,
the chairman, to appoint a committee of
seven to wait upon the Southern Pacific
Company and also upon the Santa Fe
Railway Company to ascertain if a lower
transportation rate on oil from the several
districts could not be obtained. In ac
cordance with this authorization General
W. H. H. Hart was made chairman of the
committee to wait upon the railway peo
ple and E. P. Heald and E. D. Berri were
also named as members of the committee.
The remaining members will be appointed
later.
Colonel Crane, ln calling the convention
to order, eald that one of the most vital
things to be considered was how to get
crude petroleum to the point of con
sumption. He also advocated co-operating
strongly with the California Miners' Asso
ciation.
There was much debate before any con
clusions were reached. Among the speak
ers were E. D. Berrl, Dr. C. T. Deane, W.
B. Wlnn. Sylvaln Solomon. L. P. Crane.
D. S. Thompson, J. B. Toplita. W. H. H.
Hart. Dr. J. 8. Potts and D. F. Belden.
The general opinion of the speakers was*
that the rates charged for the moving of
Oil from the districts were too large. Gen
eral Hart and others spoke of a pipeline
ln case the railways should not extend
their Hne9 to the places now lacking
transportation. General Hart said that 30
cents was about the proper rate for bring
ing the oil to San Francisco, as against 42
cents per barrel, the present rate. The
assembly room was filled with representa
tives of the oil companies. W. B. Sim
mons acted as secretary-

COBXNTHIANS^GIVE
GBEETTNG TO HYNES
Taking advantage of the appearance of
"Billy" Hynes the Corinthians thronged
the Orpheum last night to the exclusion
of every one' else from fifteen rows of
the center section. It was a greeting they
had prepared for their favorite and they
allowed three nights to go by to Jet him
get over any nervousness that he might
feel before greeting his old comrades from
the professional stage.
Hynes' appearance was the signal Â¦ for
enthusiastic applause from every good
Corinthian who could stamp a foot or
thump his palms, and right well did he
respond to nls welcome. He talked and
he sang and he chose for his songs those
his old comrades of the yacht club had
known and loved and laughed over, so
that the applause had as much of mem
ory as of Rppreoiation in its racket, and
to end it all a huge, floral- Corinthian flag
was sent up to the stage and passed over
the footlights to the new star of vaude
ville. The yachtsmen were loth to let
their favorite go and he would be prob
ably doing his turn yet but for the edict
of the stage manager and an unfeeling
dropcurtaln that fell and would not rice
again.

Mr*. H. O. TrowbrMee. one of the
daughter* of Frederick Delger. the de
ceased millionaire of Oakland, has en
tered the medical department of the Uni
versity of California as a student, and in
tends to take a full course and secure a
physician's degTee.
This will be a great surprise to the many
friends of Mrs. Trowbridge. who never
eutpected such a step upon her part; and
of these friends there are many in Oak
land, for Mrs. Trowbridge was one of the
leaders of the beau mond> of Oakland.
Her beautiful home on Vernon Heights,
rear that of United States Senator Per
kins, was the center of the social, philan
thropic, artistic and literary Jife of Oak
land, and many of the most important of
Oakland's functions took place there. She
took a moft prominent part ln many of
the Oakland philanthropic and charitable
aspociaUors, such as the kindergartens,
Fabiola Hospital and others. She is one
cf the daughters of tho man who ownnl
more land ln Oakland than any other
tingle person, whose wealth was ln the
millions and whose inrome from his rent*
*'Â«( enormous. She had plenty of money
and used It in many charitable ways.
During the parly part of the Paris Ex

Â¦went to Europe and toured the Continent
for several months. Mr. Trowbrldge thÂ»Â»i
returned to Oakland, while Mrs. Trow

Manager Grau and Madame Schu
man-Heink Speak From a Bit
ter Experience.
"St Louis is no longer a musical town,"
bo Bays Maurice Grau. The music-loving
public of St. Louis on November 10 of
this month opened a musical festival sea
eon. They arranged with Impresario
Grau to include in the programme such
well-known artlsta as Mme. Nordlca.
Mme. Schumann-Heink, both of whom are
at present in this city, and Charles Gau
taler and Mme, Lilian Blauvet. Mr Grau
may have a fine ear for music, but he
alao has a very keen business sense, and
as he bade good-by to Mme. Nordica when
she started for St. Louis he also told her
that she was not to sing until she saw the
color of the coin. Her engagement price
was 11900, and when she appeared at the
concert hall she promptly told the man
agement that she would not go on until
she was paid. The management had to
go Into the highways and the byways to
get the money, but at last they scraped
together the amount. The, other three
artists were not so fortunate when they
arrived a day later. Business was very
much to the bad. and acting under Grau's
instructions Gautaier. Mme. Blauvet and
Mme. Schumann-Heink returned to Chi
cago without the St. Louis public hearing
them sing.
Manager Grau was seen last night in
the Palace Hotel, and was very willing to
talk on the subject.
"I told all my people to not sing â¢with
out getting their money in advance. Mme.
Nordica was paid, but the other three art
lets did not see any money in sight, and
acting under my Instructions they did not
sing. I am the loser on the proposition,
as I had to pay their railroad fares from
Chicago to St. Louis and return."
Mme. Schumann-Heink was engaged to
sing one night for $1000. She haa this to
say:
"It Is awful. I went there to sing and
there Is no place to sing. They promised
me 11000, but there Is no money. I ring
for a boy at the hotel; there is no boy.
I want to get a train; there is no train.
Say. tell me what is that place San
Loois."
Telegrams from St. Louis say that the
festival was all right, but that the people
did not appreciate It. The charge is open
ly made that the management to swell
the receipts sold peanuts and chewing
gum during the concerts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Nov. 15.
Because of a auarrel about a woman
Virgil Dimmick, a Southern Pacific
switchman, was seriously stabbed this
morning by Oran Watson, a waiter, who
has rooms at the German House, Wash
ington street, near Seventh, where the
cutting affray occurred. Watson is in
custody to await the results of the In
juries he inflicted, and Dlmmlck was re
moved to the woman's house, on Fifth
street. She Is known as Stella Walker.
The row occurred in Watson's room
shortly after 3 o'clock. Dlmmlck and the
waiter met in the woman's place. Later
they separated, Watson going to the
lodging-house. The waiter told the de
tectives that he had trouble with the
woman, and that she fald she was going
to force an apology. He saw Dimmick ac
companying her to his room and departed.
Later he returned, to find his unwelcome
guests still waiting for him.
There were words, and Watson says
Dlmmlck knocked him down twice. The
waiter gathered himself together, grabbed
a blackjack from under his pillow and hit
DImmick on the heaO. The weapon was
a piece of rubber hoso loaded with shot,
but the plug slipped out and the leaden
filling rolled out. Dimmlek rushed upon
Watson, and then the waiter pulled a
knife and stabbed his assailant repeat
edly. ' One cut that reached the right lung
is very dangerous, . according to the Re
ceiving Hospital surgeons, who attended
the wounded man.
Watson fled after the assault, but was
arrested by Policemen Sill and Lynch at
the rear of the German House. He was
not regretful, but declared he had been
compelled to defend himself from DIm
mick, who had been kicking him.
The woman's statement to the police
was in the main corroborative of the
waiter's story.
Dimmick is married and has a family.
He resides at 1524 Fifth street. Watson
has been employed at the Piedmont res
taurant.

OPENING NIGHT OF ART
ASSOCIATION EXHIBITION
lery of the Hopkins
Mansion.
Well Dressed Crowd Throngs tho Gal-
I^ast evening was the opening of the
fall exhibition of the Art Association. It
was a private view for the members of
the organization, and they took the full
est advantage of the occasion. The ex
hibition this year is limited to the works
of California artists.
The main gallery of the Hopkins man
sion is hung- with canvases portraying
every subject known to the painter's
fancy. The pictures are not particularly
numerous, but they have been well se
lected and there is a notable absence of
pictorial wallflowers. Nearly all the local
artists are represented and amonsr them
are some new names that may follow the
worth of their work into public favor.
Of the old ones Keith is there and La ti
mer and Gamble and Miss Froellch and
CadenaBSo and Stanton and Mrs. Chltten
den and half a hundred others. Keith has
several landscapes which attract much At
tention and Mrs. Chlttenden has two
flower pieces characteristically beautiful
and a portrait of a little girl which even
as early as last evening In the hum of
the social distractions of opening nlarht
found favor enough to hold a crowd bo
fore it.
A feature of the exhibition is a number
of designs for the monument to the vol
unteers to be erected In Golden Gate Park.
The designs are exhibited in the main
hallway and divide honors with the pict
ures in the gallery.
The opening night was distinctively a
social affair. There was soft music to
lend its charm to the place and the oc
casion. The exhibition will be open every
morning, afternoon and evening until De
cember 13, and on several of the evenings
between this and the closing promenade
concerts will be added to the general at
traction.

PHOENIX. Ariz., Nov. 15.-C. W. Har
ris came to Phoenix very quietly about
two weeks ago Â¦with C. M. Binford's run
away wife. The pair will probably arrive
in Los Angeles to-morrow,' but not to
gether. Mrs. A. C." McComas. mother of
Claire Blnford, will also be on the train.
Harris stopped In Phoenix after his ar
rest long enough to plead not guilty to the
charge of unlawful cohabitation before
United States District Judge Street to
day, when he bought a ticket, for Los An
geles.
Mrs. McComas and Claire left on the
same train, the former stating that she
â¢would go through to the coast, but re
fused to give the destination of her
daughter. Charles Binford, she said, has
arranged for the future disposition of his
wayward wife, and she Indicated that Mr.
Binford, firmly believing in the Innocence
of his wife, has agreed to a family re
union.
Elnford's orlglnnl plan was to secure the
acquittal of his wife and offer no opposi
tion to a divorce. It now seems probable
that In case of her acquittal she will re
join him In Prescott.
A large crowd thronged the courtroom
to-day to witness the arraignment of.
eight United States prisoners, seven of
whom are charged with violating the
Edmunds act. Harris. Claire and Mrs.
McComas formed the,center of attraction.
Harris pleaded not guilty, and his case
was set for December IS.
Claire, closely followed by her mother,
walked down the aisle and they seated
themselves opposite Harris. They were
noticeably harassed by the gaze and
whisperings of the spectators. The fixed
expression on Claire's face gave way to a
smile as she remarked the reporters, but
she resumed her grave demeanor after u
stolen glance from Harris. Her case is
also set for December IS. â¢
"Although we are all convinced of
Claire's Innocence," remarked Mrs. Mc-
Comas upon leaving the courtroom, "still
it is awful to be compelled to face a
crowd of Idlo curiosity-seekers, whose
ideas of my daughter's troubles are
greatly distorted."
Harris walked within a few feet of
the mother and daughter and looked as
though he would like to explain to the
couple how It happened.
"You may Bay," continued Mrs. Mc-
Comas. ."that I have been with my daugh
ter constantly since my arrival, and I
am polnsr to etay with her. I -was in San
Francisco when I heard of the affair, and
although they wanted me to continue my
trip to New York with my daughter Alice
I am now more than repaid, since Â£ am
now satisfied of her Innocence. She did
not know much about thÂ« world and was
very susceptible to hypnotism."
Mrs. McComas then proceeded to give
her views on hypnotism, "Which some
people scoff nt," she said, "but which is
a stern reality. Mrs. Blnf6rd went to
Harris for treatment when she would
have been unable to tip the scale at 95
pounds. A few weeks' hypnotic treatment
Increased her weight to 125 pounds, al
though Los Angeles doctors told her be
fore she adopted Harris' treatment that
she could not live three weeks." â¢
' "Then Harris saved your life," asked
the reporter of Mrs. Blnford. "Yes," she
replied. "But I wiph I had died."
Since Harris" admission to ball he has
grained considerable sympathy and won
friends. It was a case of infatuation mis
taken for love, think many people, and
most of them express the wish that both
Harris and Claire Blnford will escape the
wrath of Uncle Sam.

EQUITABLE UNABLE
TO PAY ITS DEBTS
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Nov. 15.
The Equitable Building and Loan Asso
ciation of Oakland cannot pay its debts
and Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, for
Prank H. Gould and E. D. SlcCabe. State
Building and Loan Association Commis
sioners, has commenced suit against It to
force it to close its doors.
In the suit which was filed in the
Superior Court this afternoon the com
missioners ask that a perpetual Injunc
tion be issued against the corporation and
that, a receiver be appointed to take
charge of the property.
As grounds for this action the complaint
states that the Equkablo Building and
Loan Association is conducting its busi
ness in an unsafe manner and hazardous
to those having funds in its custody. It
also eays that unless enjoined from con
tinuing the business further Jt will result
in irreparable injury to the people of the
State of California,
These allegations are 'founded on the
report of the Commissioners of the
Building and Loan Associations, which
was made after an examination of the
books on October 6. The commissioners
then found that 'the corporation was con
ducting its business at a loss. The assets
were found to amount to $57,069 21. while
the liabilities amounted to 159,240 03
The cause Qf this condition is stated to
be an unwise loaning of large amounts of
money on real property which had re
verted to the corporation In default of
payment of the loans. The property com
ing into the hands of the corporation in
this way amounts to $27,414 91. It. has*
greatly depreciated in value and. is hard
to realize upon for the reason that It Is
still depreciating. Besides this large sum
there is outstanding on loans on real
estate $25,433 39.
There is at present a suit pending
against the association to recover some
$2700. which was invested by a Mrs. Corn
stock. She claimed that she could not get
her money even after repeated demands
and was finally forced to attach the prop
erty of the association. Â¦; "â¢â¢.-. -;.Â¦â¢

A SECOND DISH
Showed the Value of Condensed
Food.
"It is a delicious novelty and very
grateful to the palate. I found, about
midway in my second dish, that I had
sufficient for a meal and realized for
the first time that I was eating a con-
densed food that supplies one s wants
with a few spoonfuls and does not re-
quire anything like the volume to
furnish the amount of food required
as when any of the ordinary forms of
cereals are served. Grape-Nuts are
an elegant food and the Postum Cereal
Co.. Lim.. are to be congratulated
upon the discovery." said a well-known
fancy grocer of prand Rapids.

The Orlftinol Little Louisiana Company of
San Francisco, Drawing November
10, 1900.
Goat Island have heretofore had to draw
their water supply from wells on the
Island that produced water that was
hardly fit to drink, but In the future they
will have something more wholesome. A
pipe line has been laid on the bottom of
the bay from the end of the Oakland long
wharf to the Island and now the supply
comes from Lake Chabot. Uncle Sam
has put himself to all the accompanying
expense for the comfort and health of. his
various employes on the island.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15.â The residents of
FRESH "WATEH TO BE
SUPPLIED GOAT ISILAND
And so the investigation closed. S. M.
Shortrfdge, who was present in case Dr.
SussdorfC should need his advice, and
Matt Sullivan. Magulre's attorney, shook
hands cordially, and their clients showed
signs of decreasing hostility.
"It seems," said Attorney Dunne, "that
there could have been no motive on your
part for watering the milk. You were not
asked to â¢retrench in that direction, and
no one accuses you of carrying the milk
away in a paper bag."
"This increase runs through nearly ev
en' article of diet," the commissary said.
"Under the present administration the
subsistence expenditure has been consid
erably increased and other Items dimin
ished."
Witness presented a statement showing
that ninety-nine cans more were pur
chased In October this year than for the
same month last year, with twelve_ fewer
patients, making 2.78 cans per patient as
against 2.42 for October of 1899.
"It impure milk was served," Magnlre
testified, "the dilution occurred after the
milk was sent to the wards."
The commissary testified that the chief
cook, whose affidavit is part of the evi
dence against Maguire. was an enemy of
his. He had reported the cook to the su
perintendent for receiving quarters of
beef with the choice cuts removed. He
had also reported him for smoking while
ho was cooking and for the general unti
diness of the kitchen.
The evidence presented before the com
mittee has shown conclusively that the
milk was liberally wateredâ the milk
that the patients got, not the milk
that went to the superintendent's
table or was supplied in generous quan
tities to employesâ but no witness has In
any degree fixed the responsibility for the
dilution. It is evident that Commissary
Maguire will be exonerated and allowed
to retain his position. On the surface
there is evidence of a willingness of all
concerned to avoid Â¦ delving further into
the mystery of who worked the pump
handle or bringing to light any other
abuses that may exist within the hospital.
That the watering of milk has gone on
for months has Deen clearly demon
strated, and this in face of the fact that
two members of the Board of Health are
chiefs of wards in the big institution and
that Dr. d'Ancona. chairman of the Hos
pital Committee of the Board of Supervi
sors, is supposed to know what is going
on in the hospital.
The investigation has certainly demon
strated that the patients have not much
protection from those who are supposed
to see that they are properly cared for.
Dr. d'Ancona was the first witness yes
terday. He told of his visit to the hos
pital on October 31 and of taking samples
of milk from cups on the patients' table
and In Ward D. He had heard some com
plaints and an interne had told him that
the quality of milk furnished for the pa
tients was poor.
Dr. Buckley asked how it happened
that the City Chemist's report was made
public before being submitted to the
Board of Health. The witness explained
that he was acting for a committee of the
Supervisors, all of whose transactions
were supposed to be open to the public.
More harm was done by secrecy in pub
lic affairs, even If publicity should thwart
the investigation.
On cross-examination by Matt Sullivan.
Dr. d'Ancona said that the commissary
Impressed him as thoroughly devoted to
his duty, competent and honest. He had
met few men in public life that had im
pressed him so well. He had heard no
complaints whatever as to the character
of the food entering the hospital.
Maguire took the stand, and in reply to
a question of Sullivan's said that since
May he had ordered samples of milk sent
to the City Chemist three times a week.
He had received no reports from the
chemist.
The Investigation of the milk-watering
scandal of the City and County Hospital
came to an amicable conclusion yesterday
afternoon. The Hospital Committee of
the Board of Health took the case under
advisement and will make its report at a
meeting to-night.

It was my pleasure to hear the good
little Italian band now at the California
Theater last Sunday evening, In company
with the enthusiastic Latin crowd that
always greets the artist among their
countrymen. Immediately in front of me
sat a black-polled, swarthy Italian with
his' bright-eyed, wife and a child. They
were not innocent of garlic, the woman's
gown was ancient of cut and the bimbo's
pudgy fingers might have been cleaner,
but man, woman and child were Joying
in the music with all their hearts, and
they had given their six bits apiece for
the privilege, for 1 saw the man pay the
money. ,
That's not the end of the story. The
next day I saw the man, smudge-faced
and aproned, tilting a rubbish barrel into
a garbage wagon, but with still something
of the joy of the Sunday harmony In his
pleasant eye?. He had eaten and drunken
with the gods, and the whole week was
saner, sweeter, sunnier for the feast.
Xow what proportion of his income had
the wi.Â«e Italian devoted to the Indulgence
of his higher needs? Two dollars and a
quarter from say ten or, at the outside,
fifteen dollars a week. Who among you
of the grand -opera audience last night
served art at such bji apparent sacrifice?
And who among you who might have

FATHER AT THE TEACHERS' ANNUITY ASSOCIATION BENEFIT.
ALICE NIELSEN, the popular oper
atic prlma donna, will open an en
gagement at the Columbia Theater
on Monday, November 26, follow
ing Frank Daniels. Miss Nielsen
returns to what may be termed her native
heath with the largest and most expen
sive traveling organization in this coun
try. N'ot enly does she bring a supporting
company of nearly one hundred people,
but In ordeÂ» to properly Interpret the in
tricate and difficult scores of her two
operas. "The Singing Girl" and "The For
tune Teller." she is accompanied by a spe
cial orchestra of fifteen expert musicians,
Â¦which, augmented by th<Â» Columbia Thea
ter orchestra, will make a band almost as
imposing as that now playing at the
Grand Opera-house.
Miss Nielsen's supporting cast is, it is
claimed the strongest vocally and in its
comic elements that has ever appeared in
light opera In Americaâ not even except
ing the Bostonians.
In her support is the great basso pro-
fundo, Eugene Cowles, who has no equal
off the grand opera stage. Richie Ling,
the powerful dramatic tenor. Is also in her
company, together with Viola Gillette, a
beautiful and accomplished contralto.
Miss Nielsen also has three comedians.
They are Joseph Herbert, who attained
fame as the loading comedian of the Au
gnstin Daly Company; Joseph Cawthorn
who at one time was a star in farce-com
edy, and John Slavin, who was formerly
associated with Delia Fox.
The' cost of Miss Nielsen's Western trip
for salaries, railroad fares and other ex
penditures is said to be s-o great that It
will be impossible for her to reap any
financial gains from her visit to San
Francisco. Miss Nielsen, however, does
not forget that this was the city where
she obtained her first encouragement and
made her first successes. Since her ap
pearances here, in "Robin Hood" and the
Serenade, with the Bosfonians, she has

Tou don't know what you are missing.
Every performance that Mr. Grau gives
is a high artistic festival, a series of
glorious pictures, a magnificence of sen

gratification of every esthetic sense with
which we are gifted. You cannot go

W. B. Hamilton Is slated for the posi
tion of special deputy Collector of Cus
toms for the port of San Francisco. The
appointment will probably be made Im
mediately after Collector Stratton as
sumes the duties of office. The special
deputy has authority to sign for the Col
lector when the latter is absent.. The sal
ary of the office is JC600 per annum. The
position is at present filled by Stanley
Jackson. - 'â¢
Mr. Hamilton was Senator Perkins' first
choice for Collector and among those who
called on Senator Bard and indorsed Mr.
Hamilton for Collector was Senator Strat
ton.
It is presumed ] that Senator Perkins*
wishes were consulted when Collector
Stratton slated Mr. Hamilton for the spe
cial deputyship. In due time some one
will be selected for cashier of the Custom
house, the place now held by. Mr. Hamil
ton. Residents of Alameda County who
have favorites to recommend should wait
on Senator Perkins or Collector Stratton
at tho earliest opportunity.

A man, supposed from letters In his
possession to be Arpad Haraszthy, son or
the well known manufacturer of a brand
of California champagne, was found
shortly alter midnight lying on the side
walk at the corner of Hyde and A^ash
ington streets by Special Office Mahnke.
Mahnke was on the car and saw the man
lying on the sidewalk. with his umbrella
opened over his' head.'".-. ; ' ,, .^
A medical student named Moron, who
was on tho car with the officer, examined
the man and claimed his pulse was still
beating. He was hurried to the Receiving
Hospital, but was dead when that place
was. reached. *
In his pockets was found a purse con
taining a small amount of coin, a receipt
on the San Francisco Transfer Company
for flve pieces of baggage, and a letter ad
dressed to Arpad Haraszthy, 528 Washing
ton street, and signed "Frencme. \ins
letter was written apparently by an inti
mate friend, and expressed hopes- for the
safe return of the recipient from AlasKa.
In another pocket a memorandum diary
cor.taining entries concerning the. owner s
trip to Capo Nome and Â¦Â¦Â¦ other Alaskan
points was found. It described the trip
and the return trip. Evidently the de
ceased had arrived in this city on Wed
nesday on the steamer Kimball.buthad
not as yet received his baggage. . .
He was dressed in ia newly purchased
blue serge suit; with- overcoat to .match.
He wore a black fedora hat and a, blue
and white negligee shirt, but no.sus
penders. He was apparently as man or
about 40 years of age: his mustache and
imperial were of an intense black. Heart
disease was apparently the cause of his
death. -. His body was" removed to the
Morgue.- , - ,-, â¢"*â¢ " v. .

The controversy existing between the
Board of Education and Superintendent of
Schools "Webster, over what should con
stitute the required percentage for promo
tions Cf pupils, will be partially settled by
the establishment of an ungraded class In
each of the large . primary or grammar
schools. I Chairman Mark stated yester
day that this plan had been agree upon
by the board and would be inaugurated as
soon as it was deemed necessary. It is
highly probable, Mark says, that the un
graded classes will be formed in January,
In these ungraded classes pupils will be
assigned "who Imve signally failed in one
or two subjects. Mark is of the opinion
that no pupil who gets a very low mark
ing in two subjects will succeed in re
ceiving ,the. average standing of 70 per
cent in all studies. He therefore believes
that, with possibly; a very few exceptions
the ungraded classes will be composed of
pupils who have totally failed in one sub
ject only. A pupil's average percentage
may.,be 70 for example by .receiving 80
each in spelling, grammar, penmanship
and geography and only 30 in arithmetic
In that case the pupil will be advanced to
the next highest grade in the four studies
named, but he will be obliged to become a
member of the ungraded class in the par
ticular study, arithmetic, in* which he has
failed.' 'Â¦'-.
;Â¦ Mark believes that Superintendent Web
ster's j opposition to the rules for promo
tion because they do not specify a mini
mum percentage of 60 under which a pupil
may not be promoted will be done away
with by : the establishment of ungraded
classes. . By the exercise of a little appli
cation a pupil may perfect himself in the
study In which he is deficient and be pre
pared at the end of the six months to
enter the grade -to which, he was pro
moted in his other studies. .
"The board cannot agree entirely with
Mr. Webster on his minimum percentage
plan," said Mark, s "For Instance, it ap
pears to us that it would be manifestly un
fair to a pupil who has probably received
but 40 in spelling to keep him out of High
School because of that deficiency. Spell
ing is to a great extent > a , gift and it is
certain that in the -four years' term in
High i School ; the pupil's ; ability In that
study will have greatly ;. Improved. The
injustice of this would increase if the pu
pil ,r should receive. ; we will say, 100 per
cent in each n{ the other four studies,
which would; : according to our rule of
average standing, "give: him Â¦â¢ S8 per cent.
The plan of having ungraded schools is in
successful operation in Oakland and other
cities and I am sure It will succeed here.".

R 3?t T5SV m5nary examination of Dr.
Ralph Addison Huntingdon and Dr. J D
Hill charged with the murder of Jen^
tile McKown on Saturday, October "7 was
concluded before Judgre Cabanlss yester
day morning The charge against Dr.
Hill was dismissed and Dr. Huntington
was held to answer before the Superior
Court on the charge of murder In the
tfu?u U / t esTee< hla bonds beIn & fixe <* at
JlO.OuO. He was almost immediately re
leased from custody, his sureties being
the same as on the former occasion when
Sueâ¢ 3 released after "Â» Coroner's in"
When the case was called yeeterdav
morning Attorney Klournoy, for Ur Hill
called or. J. K. Laine to the 8tanu\ He
described the duties of a physician who
was called to administer an anesthetic
to a patient undergoing an operation The
physician, he said, had enough to do to
look after the patient. It was not his
duty to make a diagnosis of the case un
less called in as a consultant. He could
not watch the progress of the opera
tion.
Dr. W.F. Southard testified that it was
the practice to engage a nurse or student
to administer the anesthetic. The sur
geon who was to perform. the operation
was supposed to know tnoroughly the
condition of the patient and the adminis
tering of the anesthetic should occupy the
whole attention of the nurse or student
doing it.
District Attorney Byington raised a
storm by asking the witness: "If Dr
O Donnell were to ask you to administer
an to a patient would you
He got no further, as Attorney Flour
noy Interposed an objection that the ques
tion was irrelevant.
"It is not only irrelevant." said the
Judpe. "but it is an insult to the witness "
There was applause In court, which was
promptly suppressed.
v. ".Tho. District Attorney." said Flournoy
hotly, should be made to publicly apolo
gize for asking the witness such a qups
tion." . â¢ ;"-?"
The Ju-Vje said he did not think any In
sult -was intended and he was backed up
by Bylnffton and the matter was dronned
Dr. Charles A. Rosenthal alÂ«. o testified
as^to the duty of a physician adminis
tering an anesthetic, and said it would be
malpractice for him to watch the opera
tion.
This was all the evidence for the De
fendant Hill and no evidence was offered
for Huntington. Attorney Flournoy ask
ed for a dismissal of the charge aralnÂ«-t
Hill, which was onpo?eÂ«l by the District
Attorney. Ex-Judpe Ferral also areuod
that there was nothing actually proved
against Hunt inglon beyond the suspicion
of Dr. Inland and moved for a disrniÂ«;<?il
The Judge said that the* tÂ«t?mSSv
against Huntington was Â¦â¢ infinitely
stronger than that against Hill and it was
strong Â«Â»nounh, in his opinion, to Justlfv
him in holding Huntinpton to answer be

The announcement that the Rev. Father
W. D. McKinnon, formerly chaplain or
the First California Rcgiraent but now of
the regular army, would deliver a lecture
before leaving again for the Philippines
was sufficient to very comfortably nil
Metropolitan Temple last nlghc. The rev
erend gentleman told of his experiences in
the tropical isles, particularly in Manila
and Honolulu, and was listened to with
earnest attention.
The lecture was divided into two par. 9.
the first being devoted to a description of
the inhabitants and customs of Hdbolulu.
the Corregldor Islands and Old Manila,
while In the second the lecturer spoke at
some length of New Manila, The lecture
was illustrated with some very beautiful
stereopticon views, which caught the
fancy of audience. These views had an
additional Interest from the fact that
they were taken in the places described
by the lecturer himself.
In opening his talk last night Father
McKinnon embraced the opportunity to
tell his audience with vhat pleasure it
is he will return to his army duties in the
"return to the field of my past
labors," he said, "with a cheerful andH
strengthened heart, deteimined to do m>
utmoft. whatever work it shall become ,
my duty to undertake. '
Father McKinnon continued speaking,
in part as follows: "The East, so far as
those islands are concerned, has suddenly
become of great Interest to the whole
world. Three years ago the people of the
United States knew but little and cared
still less about that group of j islands,
later the theater of stirring circumstances
of war, the Philippines. Now. however,
this lack of Interest has become trans
formed into an eagerness to meet with,
information about our new possessions,
which, by many capable books and maga
zine articles, has been partially met.
The lecturer then introduced his audi
ence to Honolulu, showing many views
of the harbor and surrounding country,
with a view of the Lake of Fire, which
elicited much applause from the audience.
"Too much cannot be said of the hospi
tality of the residents of Honolulu, said
the lecturer. "It is open handed, grace
ful and lavish. Honolulu Is the most hos
pitable city in the world."
"Corregidor Island was thÂ» next placw
described, and much Interest was excited
by some excellent pictures of natives and
their huts in the palm groves. "They are
people of small Intellect " said Father
McKinnon; "the lowest, in fact in all
these islands. They live on wild game,
which they shoot in the woods of the in
terior with arrows.
-"The Archbishop was delighted to see
our soldiers enter the city." said the lec
turer "for. as he told me afterward, he
recognized that the American Government
was the one which he would desire for
the growth of our religion. -He is a'corts
ous man, deep student and able priest.
He is beloved. by his people:"

abounding and astonishing cast of prin
cipals that it seems possible to get â¢ to
gether.
Â¦Melbaâ well, It has been seriously ques
tioned If the audience of Monday night â
the "Romeo and Juliet" audience â were
not the victims of some Incredible Jest on
the part of the famous diva. Frigid, In
flexible, Irresponsive as Juliet, Melba cer
tainly was, if one may believe eyes and
ears, but this pitiful, tender, lovJng, hu
man figure â¢which Meiba as Marguerite
gave to us last night was a revelation and
profound surprise. She was not the same
creature. Her very voice was different.
Nobly pure, exquisitely modulated and of
the utmost pearliness of tone. Melba's
voice has always been, but there was the
tender thrill, the note of almost unbear
able pathos, color, passionâ all that one
may ask of musician, actress, woman.
Hall! Melba. queen of song!
"What a lovely devil," I heard my
neighbor say as Plancon strode about the
stage dominating everything by his over
whelming personality. And so say I. He
is a "lovely devil." Almost would he per-
Buade one to a return to the brimstone
imaginations of one's childhood, though
he has too much of a royal good humor to
be amply convincing in sinister sugges
tion. His voice has every desirable quality,
depth, compass, warmth, power and an
amazing flexibility. He Is eminently sat
isfying. His acting, too, was delightful.
The touch of comedy when he tucks the
little Bauermeister's (Martha) arm into
his, and fools the fatuous widow for a
passing moment, was a boon and blessing.
I feel like, the picturesque critic of the
Criterion. I should "like to herd up all
humanity within hearing" of Pol Plancon!
Saleza's Faust was a 'Signified and
graceful figure. He has a smooth, virile,
finished voice, a fine pianissimo, riellfrht
ful enunciation and he sinprs with vigor
and conviction. His Faust :a a good one.
Valentine was excellently sung by Cam
panarl, who has a pure, clean barytone
of very pleasing quality. Mr. Dufriche
did a good Wagner.
