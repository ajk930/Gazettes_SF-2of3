Besides. M. Trelat holds that ths hori

from pure, being vitiated by passing
through layers of dust and vapors escap
ing from tho soil. According to this vle-w
houses should be built so as to receive the
light at an angle of 30 dejn-ees. and to ob
tain this light houses should not be higher
than two-thirds the width of the street.
If a street were thirty feet wide, for ex
ample, the houses on either sid* of It
should not be higher than twenty feet.
As there are few houses comptying with
the3e requirements, tho suggestion Is
made not to cut down the buildings, but
to widen the streets, a sustention upon
which every one would be slad If tho mu

if the light were admitted properly on all

THE SUNDAY CALL
2
MY STRUGGLE TO
GET ON THE
STAGEAs soon as the gold has been weighed
and a receipt given it is sent into the
first melting-room, where the heterogene
ous mixture of quartzy nuggets, sandy
dust and lead-colored amalgam ts melted,
by itself in a plumbago crucible and cast
into a homogeneous brick, or bricks. as>
the quantity may be. As soon as this is
cooled two chips are taken from eac.i
Vrick and sent to the assay-room, where
an assay Is made of each of the pieces
Separately. If the results of the two as
says tally, then It is known that both are
correct, the value of the bricks are de
termined by their weight and fineness and
the owner receives minted coin In return
for his receipt. â¢ ..'
After this the gold, having become the
property" of the United States. Is again
melted, mixed with Ibh metal and poured,
melting hot into tuba of cold water to
granulate it. so that the base metals can
be dissolved out completely by acid. The
gold remains as a fine livery looking pow
der, which Is pressed into cakes and cast
into ingots of pure gold. Each of these is
then weighed and with It is placed enough
copper to reduce it to the proper alloy for
coin, which must be hard to resist abra
sion. The gold is then melted for the
third time with the copper and cast Into
billets cf proper size to be passed through
the rolling mills in the coiner's depart-"
ment. This is the third and last k'.nd of
gold brick which is made at the mint.
The present season has been a lucky
one with the minor;? and the mint shows
It. for in the pictures on thfs page over
$K).0CO.00O worth cf go!d bricka have posed
and looked pleasant. â¢ Â¦_.'Â¦â¢
There in always a smal! ncrcemaye al
lowance for loss In handling the g^ld and
this is charged up to exrenses. In ear
lier times methods .were cruder, and less
w">.s known about the peculiarities of tha
precious metal. The wasts \'ha then
ana araw interest to tne kimount or twD
hundred dollars a month, at which rate
it would not take the brick so very many
years to buy itself a gold pedestal.
That shows the reward which comes to
anything for being good and pure. It
pay3 to be pood. An imitation gold brick
could not earn itself a pedestal if it tried
till the end cf time.
San Francisco's Mint melts more virgin
gold direct from the placer nuggets than
any other mint on earth, and its coinage
for thin year v.iil probably amount to
more than sixty million dollrsrs in twenty,
ten and five dollar gold pieces.
This is not exclusively American gold,
as the British Columbian. Mexican and
South American mines ship the greater
part of their product directly here, and
a hundred million dollars of croid reserva
on hand all the time, and those two pipes
are part of the reserve. They /ere mads
out of 20-dollar gold pieces and have al
most paid for themselves in the saving of
expense for broken glass, cpllled ac!d and
corroded lead pipes, whlc'.i ~re amonx

made to abate.
The most beautiful sight In the world Is
a eold brick.
Its beauty is not skin deep, either, for
it is just thÂ» fame all the way through.
It is as wonderful as It is beautiful, for
its possiHliMâ Â« arc as unlimited as human
attairment. .t has a pleasant expression
âa sort of SSO.000 smile that iz fixed and
pet.
When you realize what a gold brick caa
do you will see the truth of the forego
ing.
To bppln with, it !s worth $30,000; that Is
more thr.n most of us are or ever hope to
be worth. Tf you happen to be an average
farmhand setting $30 rt month it will take
yo:i just ninrty years to earn the price of
onv of them if you navÂ« no such bad Juck
a? iosing your health and if you manage
to bold your place that long.
If you are a more .Â«kl!led le borer or a
clerk wttl: some yearn' experience you
may be getting $2 a day.ir $G0,a month,
which Is a very comfortable sum. On
that salary, if you live at home, wear old
clothes and don't spend anything, forty
f.vc years of steady work will put you In
the position of being worth as much as
that brick which you see smiling at. you
so pleasantly from thr center o the page.
A gold brick, then. Is worth more than
the avrage man. either in actual coin or
in potential possibilities. See what it repre
sents when other standards are taken In
place of the human, which is highest 'of
all.
Farm horses are worth about $30 apiece
at the present time, take them as they
run, young and old, good and bad. The
gold brick could buy a thousand of them.
Or If the gold brick did not .want to buy
things with Itself It could just sit down
\>y the coiner. There n'.-e at present over
twenty million dollars' worth of them
piled In the different treasure caverns
Fcattered through the big stone building
or. F*ifth street, where over a thousand

this, dealers have established a taiiff
which makes old gold as hard to get rid

Jl AJackson's masterpiece, "Ramona,"
has Just been published by Little,
Itrown & Co., Boston. Although Mrs.
Jackson died in San Francisco some six
tcfn years or more ago, this classic from
her pen will undoubtedly live among the
best romantic fiction for all time. It is
a nory that nearly every Califorr.ian has
roadâ !f not they should delay no longer,
for the y hive missed the lj<?s=t novel of
the old CaUfornlan days before the Amer
ican invasion that has over been written.
It vroula be a real pleasure to dwell at
lrngth upon the graceful charm and poÂ«Â«t-
Icai earnestness cf "H. H." as exempli
fied in this her greatest work; to recall
fifrain her sympathetic treatment of Ra
mor.a. the Indian Alcssandro. and Father
Salvirrderra; but t--pace forbids nor is it
necessary now for any voice to be raised
In praise of a work so generally accepted
as rnatchless in its own peculiar field.
"Itair.ona" would be Just as good reading
from a paper covered book hs done into
exquisitely bound and printed volumes,
hut aside from the ehame it would be
to ask such a work of genius to appear
in unbecoming garb, the present edition
gives something more than tho text. It
contains photogravures from the brush
of Henry Sandham, the famous artist
who studied his. subjects with Mrs. Jack
fon, and whose work is here reproduced
by the best of modern processes. These
illustrations make the volumes^oubly In
teresting and valuable.
Mr. Sandham has written a brief intro
duction explanatory of his work, in which
fce says:
I was fortunate enough to trai%l In com
rasy with Mrs. Jackson at the time that she
TvaÂ» .acc.MTnulatir.s hÂ«r material for what has
Bince become the bÂ«-st-known of all her books,

Vnew neither the name nor the exact details
of the Tiroj>os<-d book: but I did know that the
prneral plan was a defense of the Mission In
dians, together with a plea for the preserva
. tioa of the Mission buildings, and so on, the
Â¦ whole to be enveloped in the mystery and
pootry of romance. I had thus sufficient knowl
i edee ; cf the spirit o f the text to work with
: ker-ner zest upon the sketches for the illustra
tion?âf-kttches. which it may be of Interest to
Know, were always made on the Â«"j>ot with
Mr?. Jackson close at hand supgestin? empha
sis on this object or prominence to that, as it
was .to have tm-clal mention in the book.
Thus it can readily be understood what
c. \aluable acquisition the present edi
tion will make to any library, for these
pictures are properly as much a part of
Â¦the complete romance as the text itself.
.They are pictures created under the guld
ir.g hand of the author herself. Her spirit
has been breathed into them and they
give the finishing touch of reality to her
words. Besides the large number of full
page drawings each chapter is decorated
with a pen and ink sketch heading of
real life or existing place.
An able introduction ie given by Sarah
C. Woolsey, better known as Susan Cool
idgei who was a personal friend of Mrs.
Jackson and therefore writes as one with
authority. She gives a most delightful
picture of the author â one full of the sym
pathy ar.d understanding made possible
only by long acquaintance. In speaking
of Mrs. Jackson's personality she says:
Several winters she spent In New Haven,
Â¦ a^d it was thore that I first made her ac
quaintance. She was Ftill a young woman at
that time, under thirty, and. without exactly
' being pretty, she was remarkably attractive.
Symmetry rather than beauty was her charac-
W-riÂ«!c. Her hair, of the palest blond and fine
as nn Infant's, rirpled naturally round her
tnrehead. Her eyee, of a greenish gray, were
full of dance en<l mlsclilef. There seemed al
ways a laugh in them, even when the rest of
her face was grave. She had a. slender, ex
i restive hand and a pretty foot. A eort of
eacer eparkle distinguished her manner, and
hf-r whole personality was full of charmâ that
. < Juf'.ye Quality which all feel, but none can
Â« xplain. Her dress -has always becomlni? and

ot time to such matters, later she became more
indifferent to them, but there was always

Mrs, JÂ»ckson had no exact persoi.s in

Mr. iSandham holds to the contrary^ Here

Tolstoi Letters ar)d Essays.
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. ofNcw.iork
have Just published an admirable collec
tion of the essays, letters and miscellanies
of Count Lyof N. Tolstoi. Nothing is
moro Interesting Â¦ in the world of blogr
raphy than the logical consistency of
Count Tolstoi's moral development. Ths
beginning of its evolution may be traced
even in the earliest of his romancesâ
"The Cossacks"â and all through the
more serious parts of his later novels,
culminating, of course, in "Resurrection."
This evolution has been in the direction of
Christian socialism. He has evolved his
code of ethics directly from New Testa
ment teachings and* he has iterated his
belief in the propriety of every man earn
ing his bread in the sweat of his face, in
sharing his goods with those poorer than
himself, in doing away with courts, and
all forms of government and in disband
ing armies by the natural process of all
men refusing to bear arms. These and
similar tenets he has emphasized In the
form of parables, letters, to friends and
newspapers and . carefully considered es

and the power of, sarcasm. Great as he

his band of reckless adventurers and the
various things they did. Â¦ The second is

certainly will delight the children. In the

D.D. The object in the three chapters of
his exposition Is not to cover the whole
ground of the spiritual or religious teach

Browning, which would probably require
a larre volume; but rather he takes, in
the case of the one, the -poem entitled

the other the central teaching of "Aurora

William Hemstreet is the author of a
work. "Electricity and the Resurrection,"
which purports to l>e a demonstration of
the real and objective existence of Paul's
"Spiritual Body." He discards all mysti
ticism in religion and theology and claims
that to find the one religion the human
race must abandon a metaphysical God
and a metaphysical soul for a soul and a
god that are connected with science.
Proceeding upon this postulate, the au
thor searches for the material substancfl
or organic essence of the soul, and is
forced to admit that he can find no other
than the luminiferous ether, the motions
and phenomena of which are known as
electricity, and fill the human body, as
life. The book is written for the masses
as well as the discriminating student.

Mr. P.uoll has written with his heart
and soul in the work, and the result is a

Electricity and tbe Resurrection.
"It is by no means enough that an offi
cer of the navy should be a capable mar
iner. He must be that, of course, but also
a gmit deal more. He should be as well
a gentleman of liberal education, refined
manners, punctilious courtesy and" the
nicest sense of per?onal honor."
Jones' own idea of what a naval com
mandor should be applies well to his own
case and gives the spirit in which he is
treated in the present work. He says:
Paul Jones has long been such a famil
iar object in romance and fiction that his
name has come to be Involved in an nir
of uncertainty and mystery. He is re
garded rather for his personal prowessâ
a man of action with the bold, chivalrous
dash of the buccaneerâ than as the found
er of the American navy. In reality he
was a man who not only possessed all
the bravery of a daring personality, but
combined as well the wise head of an
experienced seaman and a well-educated
mind.
.In two volumes just published. "Paul
Jones, the Founder . of the American
Navy," Augustus C. Buell has by the
uid of his technical knowledge brought
out these very points which have been so
long neglected and given to the. naval his
tory of this country a most important ad
dition, lie has brought in plenty of new
material to give life to his work and com
bined the whole in the form of a story
as interesting to the general reader as to
the lover of history pure and simple. He
gives us Paul Jones as a historical char
acter, as a living personage who can be
compared with the men of that exciting
poriod. The author, being a man famil
iar with the building and sailing of ships,
possesses to just the happy degree the
power of selection and discrimination nec
essary to present a clear statement of
facts and at the same time make a read
able story without verbosity.

The author cannot be accused of lack
ing in the strength of his convictions. At
times he expresses his opinions with
such force that they seem to savor rather
of a personal tirade against the man than
an impartial criticism of his work:

Mr. Peddlcord accounts for the pro
found interest of the world in Mr. Kip
ling's recent severe illness as follows:
Mr. Kipling's period of greatest popularity
will, no doubt, be found by future writers of
literary history to coincide exactly with the
period in which England and America were
vying with each other In their efforts to bring
about a strong Anglo-Saxon alliance, such, as
the world had never known before. â¢ â¢â¢ â¢
Kipling's Illness was but ah Incident, a link In
this golden chain of circumstances so happy
in their result?. Had his popularity been a
result of hla genius, the many tributes show
ered upon him by both prince and peasant. In
prose and in verse, raid at a time when he
wan literally incapacitated for doing any lit
erary-work at all, and long after works had
issued from the. press for which he has been
most, complimented, seem rather inopportune
and -fall little short of being too late. They
should have been paid at the time the pro
duction*, eliciting them issued from the press,
if meant eolely as a tribute to his genius.
From the foreging perspiration of
words, which Mr. Peddicord sheds in hjs
efforts, it will be seen that criticizing
Kipling Is hard work. . (Whitaker, Ray &
Co., San Francisco. Price, $1.)
"Calm-eyed he scoffs at aword and orown,

Blatant, he bids the world bow down,

The book in hand Is replete with the
choicest literary expression and the hap

is optimistic. Whatever of necessary

It is probable that this active and

to be basic in the sense that the popular

ecclesiastical dogmatics. With unerring

His keen appreciation of the best in life

Lovers of Irish sketches cannot fail to
appreciate and enjoy the writings of John
J. Jennings. Hi3 book containing the re
marks of the talkative Widow Magoogin
and her cronfes has been recently pub

her neighbor, Mrs. McGlaggerty. as far
back as 18S2. and continued her conversa
tions, first in the St. Loul3 Critic and
later In the New York Sunday Mercury,
until 1P94. Some conversations â not more
than half a dozenâ on topics of recent in
terest have been added. Otherwise the
collection consists of reprints of the Irish
widow's previous utterances. (Published

The central thought which connects the
papers is that the modern world is in a
condition of instable equilibrium: that the
center Is shifting toward this country;
that the struggle of the future will force
America and Great Britain to act as allies
to maintain themselves against the grow
ing power of Russia. The writer holds
that the British have overtaxed their
strength; that decay has set in; that the
British islands will eventually be only an
Anglo-Saxon outpost facing Europe. The
forces which tend to shift the center of
dominion he considers to be Irresistible
and inevitable. The various papers are
short and have all the defects of maga
zine articles written for a momentary in
terest, and it Is to be regretted the au
thor did not have the industry to revise
them all and work out hia theory in a
more satisfactory manner. (Published by

By this time the allotted half-hour was
up and the President retired to his office
for a stretch of* some three hours' hard
work.
The morning work in the White House
seems to move on the better every day
for that short chat in Mrs. McKinley's
room. When she ts not well enough for
it a great solemnity hangs over Presi
dential shoulders and* extends over the
whole household. It reaches past the
Cabinet to the clerks and on to bellboys
and even to stablemen and gardeners. %
The^e times are happily infrequent. For
the most part Mrs. McKinley is able to
supervise her home, to do her own shop
ping and discharge many social duties.
The morning chat is more often given
to Mr. McKinley's affairs than to any
thing else. He gives her a sketch of the
past twenty-four hours in his official
world and she listens eagerly. .
"I always wanted to be able to go cut
and work for you, as some wives have
done for their husbands, but the next
best thing is to encourage you. Isn't It?"
she says. And he always assures her that
no wife ever before did so much to help
on a husband as she does in the depths
of her big armchair.
"I don't want you out stump-speaking
or canvassing," he says. "Here is the
place where you are needed; right here,
near at hand, where I can run to you with
my troublesâ as if you hadn't enough of
your, own, when you have just dropped

world Is waiting to hear about the day'g
trials â her sympathies ready to be extend

sympathies, however.
"Has there been all kinds of trouble
some matters to attend to this evening?**
she will say.
And the chances are he will reply:
"Possibly â I really can't quite remem
ber. I never can rcmemb- .- troublesosM

Then he tells her some good Joke on
Secretary Long or an attractive bit ot
gossip about Hay, Instead of the cares

Perhaps her unusually broad education
has had something to do with developing
her sense of humor. She says that ana

at It. Part of her young ladyhood was
spent as cashier In her father's bank. Sha

During this busy season she Is obliged
to depend more than usual upon tea-table

to make demands upon hl3 time; she
knows that he would respond to those de

to make up for it. She recalls the time

Mr. and Mrs." McKlnley lunch together.
All the morning's doings are talked over
and the afternoon's plans discussed.
Sometimes the President has the happy
news that he will have a little spare time,
and he deferentially asks if he may have
the pleasure of her company for a drive.
Once In a while he proposes an evening at
the theater and that is always delightful,
for she is very fond of the theater. She
likes comedy best: "There Is enough
trouble In the world without seeing aad
plays and reading sad books," she says.
During the President's busy forenoon
hours his wife drives out on shopping ex
cursions or visits with the little folks who
are often gathered In the big house, or
reads and knits if the weather is too bad
for driving and if there be a dearth of

grayish-blue eyes, with dark sweeping
lashes, and eyebrows that marked a low,
well-knit forehead. A genial mouth, but

"Which threat shall be addod to the
charge sheet." said the superintendent,
"though 1 don't think Mr. Glover need
fear your threats any more than your
courage; you are a bully and a brute.
Now get!"
The next moment Abner Digges waa
literally lifted into the nearest vacant cell
and the bolts drawn upon him, to the
blatant music of his execrations. Never
theless, he was a much more dangerous
character than the superintendent was
willing to believe of a creature who. being
rebuffed by a woman, could draw a knife
upon her.
"Come and have a drink," said the de
tective, buttoning his ' heavy overcoat,
when they were once more in the street;
"you look cold."
"I feel cold," said Glover. N
"There's a 'special bottle' for old friends
at the Grand Pacific."
"I am staying there," said Glover.
"Lucky man! Then you know the 'spe
clal bottle.' ".
"I don't drink," said Glover, shivering.
"Sometimes I call that special brand a
naedlcine. You must let me prescribe for
you. You shall have snow in an hour or
two. Don't you foel it In your bones?
They say spring comes In severely In Eng
land. I reckon we can match it."
"Spring is lovely in England," Bald
Glover. â¢ Â»
"Just wait till you have seen ours. Been
staying long at the Grand Pacific?"
"Two weeks. I am advised to take a
room in a boarding house. Perhaps you
can tell me of one?"
"There are so many. I should prefer
the Grand Pacific." >
"Beyond -my means, I fear," said
Glover. â¢
It was by this time nearly 4 o'clock.
The night cleaners were washing the mar
ble floor at â¢ the Grand Pacific. Others
were busy polishing the white counters
and the chairs that were arranged along
the spacious hall. At the desk the night
clerk was smoking a cigar and talking to
a belated visitor.
"Drop of the right sort," said the de
tective. *
"Why. certainly. Mister Joe." said the
clerk, bringing from beneath the countei
a -black bottle and pushing toward him a
couple of small tumblers.
Ned Glover was a nturdlly built fellow,
of medium height, square head, â¢ square
shoulders, square chin, Blue eyes, a
mouth that did not close firmly and a
light mustache that partially hid Its
weakness. His manner was that of a
frank, genial, middle class Englishman.
He watched the night clerk hand over
the bottle of old rye whisky In a half
frightened, fascinated- way, then made as
if to reject It. ,
"It's all right; don't you be afraid.
They know me at the Grand Pacific," said
the detective.
".Vermouth la about the lightest stuff
sudden wa? his appearance, though he
had only within a few minutes emerged
from the adjacent pre?s club.
"Thank you; I can protect myself." she
f=aid,' turnjng toward him a handsome
face with flashing eyes, that seemed to
reflect a jrlint of the electric light.
As the newcomer advanced to her as
ristance the bully, whose drunkenness
was partially assumed, drew from his
breast pocket not a pistol but a knife.
Before her friendly ally or the plain
clothes officer, now on the spot, had real
ised what the ruffian had done, Zella had
caught sight of the flashing steel. The
knife, as we have to learn later, was the
man's favorite weapon. It was a "bowie"
nnd had seen much real service on the
frontier. Xo ruffian who prefers a knife
to a revolver under certain given circum
stances flourishes Itâ as you see assassins
on the stage or In the pictures of murder
ous affrays â above his head, stabbing
downward, but delivers his deadly thrust
upward; and this was a fact not unknown
to Zella.
"Back! back for your life!" she ex
claimed, thrusting the stranger aside, and
at the same time catching the murderous
arm by the wrist with her left hand and
striking the would-be assassin a stinging
blow full on the face, backed by the
weight of her whole body, that sent him
reeling to a rattling fall.
"Well hit," said the officer, coming for
ward.
Several other men now appeared upon
the scene from the passageway that had
prlven their fellow bully to the street. And
Zella and her intercepted shadow disap
peared.
"Served you darn'd well right, you ugly
brute," said the officer.
"What's he done?" asked the man; while
the others simply stood around and said
nothing.
"Insuljed a woman going home after a
hard day's workâ but that is something
you wen't understand. Now, then, clear
cut!"
He drew a revolver and with the butt
end struck three quick blows upon the
pa\-ement. which almost In an Instant
were answered as if the signal had called
forth an echo.
"Get up." said the officer to the beaten
bully, pushing him with his foot. "Haul
him to his feet."
The last command was addressed to a
couple of policemen In uniform, who had
responded to his summons.
"Tha'sh all rlRh*. pard," said the man
staggering In the clutches of the police
men. "What in thunder'sh the matter?"
"Now. then, straighten up."
The man straightened up.
"Where's his knife?"
The third person who had come to the
relief of the woman picked it up.
"A nice weapon to draw upon a
woman!"
"Only meant ter frighten her," eald the
prisoner.
"And it didn't frighten her worth a
cent." cald the officer.
By this time a patrol wagon had arrived
on the scene.

"Don't say so?" remarked the detective,
sympathetically. "Feel bad?"
"No; as you people say, I feel good; but
another glass and I am ruined. Take it
away, will you?"
The Englishman leaned back in his chair
?.nd covered his eyes with his hands.
The detective rose and returned the bot

be out in the Chicago streets after mid
night, without a friendly escort. There Is
not much protection in the escort of your
shadow. It is companionable in a sense,
as a winter's fire is, especially when the
crackle of the winter's fire Is accom-
Cfliiled by the music of a cricket on the
earth.
A police officer In plain clothes standing
within the doorway of a great dry goods
store watched the woman curiously as she
sped along. "The grace of a sylph," he
s-aid to himself, "and the stride of an
athlete." He had been a newspaper man
before he entered the detective force of
Chicago, and had won his journalistic
laurels as a descriptive reporter and the
Â¦olver of one of the most mysterious cases
of criminal enterprise In the annals of
thr Prairie City.
Presently Zeila's nimble shadow had a
rival that leaped suddenly into the road
way, then mounted the side of a tall
building, to come down again In fierce
competition with the figure of the wo
man's graceful escort.
In the midst of this silent demonstra
tion a slouching fellow In a pilot jacket
and jack boots, emerging from a dark
passaevvay. confronted the woman.
"Hello! my beauty! What'sh yer game?
A walktn' ms'Fh?" said a coarse voice
with a hiccough.
Zella stood still, confronting the obsta
cle in her path.
The twii shadows stood still.
Tho officer on the other side of the
street moved up a door or two, without,
however, noticing another shadow that
began to pay tribute to the white pave
ment lower down.
"I said !sh It a walkin' ma'sh?" re
marked the ungainly brute, advancing
upon the woman.
She did not speak, but endeavored to
avoid him. He moved as she moved, and
hitched ur> his trousers, that were tucked
into a pair of heavy boots. He wore a
pilot jacket and a soft hat. He was a
miner, taking a vacation that he would
call "going on a bender."
Zella planted her feet firmly upon the
ground and measured the brute with the
coolness her father was said to assume
under fire. The moment he was within
touch of her she thrust htm from her
with an energy that bewildered him
"Begone, you brute," she said, "and let
me pass."
"Not likely," he replied, staggering to
ward her.
"Xo American insults a woman at any
time, much less alone and unprotected,
and at night. You must be some low
foreigner."
"If he's a foreigner then let a foreigner
protect you!" said the new comer, who
might have sprung up from the earth, so
"Meanter say you ain't goin'ter le 1 me
go home ter my lodgin'?"
"Not to-night," said the officer; "the
streets are dangerous at this hour; you
might get hurt. Come, step In."
"Somebody'll get hurt for this," said the
prisoner, suddenly peering into the face of
the man we at'.U call "the third person,"
"ef I don't quit Chicago for a year fu'6t."
CHAFTER II.
THE GEKMS OF LOVE AND HATE.
Zella's defeated assailant, haled before
the sreneral superintendent of the first di
vision of the police headquarters, gave the
name of Abner Digges. The charge being
entered, he stated that he was living at
the Dawson House; could refer them to
the State Bank. Denver: came to Chicago
to have some fun; net been In what they
called the tents of civilization for more'ii
a year. The scratch of a woman, he al
lowed, was not unknown to him. but a
blow worthy of a blacksmith's hammer
from one of the favored sex, he confessed,
was a new experience. Why he should be
arrested on that account he didn't rightly
understand; but he allowed the game was
thar's, if they liked to call it. He was
willin' to put into the pot any tine the'r
regulations imposed. He had no kind of
feelln apen' the officer in plain clothes:
it was his business to make trouble for
tho court. As for tho other kyote he'd
no call to come between him and the lire
lady with the sledge hammer: ho nnrt him
ud meet apron' over another kind of game,
and then there'd be music.
The superintendent, a bluff official,
looked up from his desk, where he was
making notes on the charge sheet, and an
swered the prisoner to the effect that his
knife was the most important witness
against him: that the police reckoned to
protect citizens lawfully using the street
at any hour: that it was not their busi
ness to consider his excuses. These' he
could make to Judge Keppel in the morn
ing: meanwhile he would go to the cells.
Thereupon Abner Digpes assumed a cyn
ical air, ordered his breakfast, asked If he
could leave his boots out to be blacked,
as he had to do at the Dawson House;
where he was rooming with a city mate;
could ho have a lock of the plain clothes
officer's hair? And so on. his hands thrust
deep into his breeches' pockets; but when
he was being removed he pointed an ugly
finger at the independent witness to em
phasize his threat.
"You say your name's Edmund/ Glover.

"Don't you care for whisky? Try our

tive. "Allow me. We drink it straight,
and the water after. You prefer a long
drink? "Why, then, here's water and a
tall glass."
"Thank you,", said Glover, his eyes
sparkling as he lifted the tumbler In com
pany with his newly found friend, who
simply remanded, "Jtiere we go," and emp
tied his small glass of spirit and his glass
of water to follow.
"Good, eh?"
"First rate," said Ned. "Puts new life
into a fellow."
"There's mere wit in a bottle of old rye
than you'll meet with fn the brightest
comedy, and valor enough for a regiment.

"Yes," said Glover, filling his glass in
a furtive, sly kind of way.
"Old rye, is it? Never tasted old rye

"Never lived, then, before to-night. By
gosh, what a night it'll be for you!"
"Think so," suiu Ned, laughing and
tilting his chair against the wall, after
the manner of his companion.
"My name's Joe Williams." said the de
loctive. ."I am an American, but my fa

"Yes," said Glover, sipping his whisky
with a keen relish and handing his cigar
case to the detective. "1 am a press man.
They got tired of me in London. I
thought Chicago would be easier to

"So you come over. Well, and how do
you like it?"
"It's line." he said, with a smile. "No

"You're down to it mighty quick; make

"The journalist takes his chances, and
makes his bed as comfortably as he can

"Where had you been when you
stopped into State street?"
"I was just prowling around. You
never know what a city's like until you
have seen It by night."

"You're Just too lovely, my dear!"
"I hope I'U be as lovely as you, Biddy,

"Yes, I mind." said Zella. "It's not
womanly to have a muscle, is it, Bridget
dear? Feel mine."
She tucked up the sleeve of her gown
baring a white, shapely arm. and. bend
ing it upward, ' placed Bridget's hand
upon it.
"A marauding giant he looked In tho
light of the street lamp that revealed aa
wicked a face as ever was invented to

O'Hagan.
"A girl who Is a bit of an athlete knows

into the road."
"Heaven be praised:"
"Then I might have run, but I didn't. I
think It was because I heard somebody
coming. Anyhow, the next minute the
brute was facing me again. I tried to
stop him with words of scorn; they didn't
stop him worth a cent."
"The base and brutal Saxon!" said
Bridget O'Hagan. her hands on her hips,
her eyes ttasning with patriotic Untu
ning.
"No, he was an American. I taunted
him with being a foreigner. Then a fine
young fellow appeared. He must have
dropped from the clouds."
"Tne Lord be praised!" said Bridget,
joyfully. .
" 'If he's a foreigner, then let a for

Zella did. Indeed, appear to be dwelling

the vanity of thÂ« lady athlete.
"Well, just as he was drawing his hand
back to plunga thÂ© knife upward into
the body of the stranger who had come to

he had recovered from his surprise. I
struck him in the face with my right,

gether, as women will when there is noth

"And didn't ye have a BllmpÂ«<e of the
champion who came to yer aid?"
"Never a glimpse. But he had a pleas

"Said he was a foreigner. Bad luck to

Twice during the night Zella awoke aa

And there were tears In her eyes Â¦without

IN THE BENIGNANT SHADOW OP
HIRAM DEXTER, MILLIONAIRE.
"Thank God, I am all right." said Ned
Glover as he rose the next morning, his
hand steady, his head clear. "Williams'
antidote and the Russian bath saved me.
Strange there are no Russian baths In
London. Far ahead of the Turkish. Eyes
rather red. Must get shaved. I have had
a narrow escape. One more glass and I
should have been a candidate for a sec
ond dismissal."
Ned sat In a high chair and gave himself
over to a deft manipulator. His hair
dressed, his mustache trimmed, he en
tered the breaKiast room looking all ha
could desire, a compact, sturdy English
gentleman. Instead of what he might have
been, a disheveled, unkempt, haggard
wreck, after a deoauch of drink. He was
Jn high spirits, the buoyancy of gratitude
for his escape from a worse fate than tha
blow of a ruffian's knife.
Presently he received from thÂ© hands
of Sir. Storey himself an assignment to
Interview Mr. Hiram Dexter, the million
aire and mine owner.
"About three thousand words." said
the editor-proprietor. "Ring in a sketch
of his early career; get him to talk about
thÂ© days when he kept shop; sample hl3
opinions upon the commercial prospects
of Chicago and finish with an account
of the new mines they are opening in
the Platte Valley. We're had enough of
the Klondike and Alaska. The valley dis
coveries and the new camps are fresh
ground, a welcome revival of American
interests within two or three days of the
western railway tracks."
Glover, his English hat cocked a little
to one side, his gray trousers correctly
creased, his brown overcoat complement
ed In color by his tan gloves, stepped
out into the crisp air.
The sun was making short work with
the early morning's fall of snow. The
pavements were wet with the remains of
it. The lines of the street cars glisten
ed. Here and there a pool flashed in the
roadway like a dropped mirror.
Glover passed through the handsome ro
tunda of the Palmer House, busy with
coming and parting guests, and, guided
by a colored attendant, was shown into
Mr. Hiram Dexter's room on the first
floor.
"Mr. Glover?" said Mr. Dexter, coming
forward from a desk, a gen'al smile on
his face, a heavy cigar in the corner of
his mouth. â¢ â¢Â«. ' Â¦ .

"Yes, pah," responded a colored gen

"Champagne cocktails. And give Mr.

"Yes. sah." said Sam, handing Glover a
box of cigars.
"Thank you," said Glcver. "If you will
not think me ungracious. I would prefer
not to have the cocktail."
"Would, eh? Well, Sam makes a cock

CHAPTER VII.
BREAKFAST AT MRS. O'HAGAN'S
BOARDING HOUSE.
They called it "the annex." ' It was a
large, lofty room, that had been added to
the long, rambling timbered home, known
as the Parkside boarding house. It was
something more than what is called a
frame house, though there are wooden
cottages still exlBting In Massachusetts
that were brought over from England by
the first settlers. Therefore, It does not
follow that a frame house Is a ram
shackle place. The Parkside boarding
house/moreover, had a brick foundation,
and its surrounding veranda looked out
upon a garden with shade trees and a few
ragged flower beds. It was situated In a
street of curious and detached houses that
had escaped attack from the great fire.
Its sidewalks were wooden, and its road
way unpaved; In spite of which, however,
it was generally clean, having a surface
of sand and gravel. Since the erection of
the annex, Mrs. O'Hagan's establishment
was the most important-looking place in
the district.
The saloon or dining room was paneled
In a light wood that had been varnished.
The panels were decorated .with lith
ographs of Washington, Lincoln and
Dewey: for the American-Spanish war
had only just been concluded. There were
also, la tidy frames, newspaper eucrav-

reckon, would be in the streets at tha

"Oh. I don't know." said Zella. "I was
out quite as late myself that very night."
"Ah! my dear, you're different." said
the bartender's widow.
"Of course she Is," said Mrs. O'Hagan.
"And I happen to know that she was out
on a mission of mercy, an errand of lolfe
and death, the saints be praised!"
She looked across the table with a frown
at Zella. and went on straightway to
change the subject.
"Ye all know that Miss Zella Brunnen
acts as private secretary to ould Mr. Hi
ram Dexter, the millionaire. Did ye see
the interview of him in the Chicago
Mail?"
"I have not seen the paper," said Mr.
Glencce.
"Then don't see It, dear Mr. Glencoe,"
said Zella.
"Why not, me darlint? Ladles and gin
tlemen. It's jest a testimonial to wlmmln,
that should plaze the community at large.
It was to interview Misther Dexter on the
new discoveries of gould the reporter
called upon him: but Misther Dexter could
only talk about the wonderful rise and
progress of wimminklnd and the great
merits of a young lady in his employ. She
happened to be out at the tolme. by which
token he was able to do her honour. He

"Our Zella, of course!" exclaimed

"Of course, of course. God bless her!"
said Mrs. O'Hagan, greatly to Zella's em

"Then let him. How do I know if I

bartender.
"But if I go. ye'll none of ye finish yer

"Oh. yes we will!" said Mr. Glencoe.
"And Indeed we will," echoed Mrs. Fer

\
MR. HIRAM DEXTER'S CONCESSION
AND THE MORAL THEREOF.
"Well?"
"Quittlng the Mail?" asked Williams in
response to Ned Glover's hasty "Good
morning."
"What do you mean?"
"Mr. Hiram Dexter is not only the prin
cipal stockholder, but Storey's most Intl
vnate friend."
"Well!" repeated Williams almost with
a sneer. "You left Mr. Dexter standing
on tho sidewalk with as much indifference
as if you were the greatest stockholder
and he a loafer in search of work." l -
"Did I?" said Glover, looking round in
time to catch sight of Mr. Dexter's coat
tails, as his would-be patron disappeared
In the hall-way of the Chicago Daily Mail
building.
"I don't think that Is how he felt. I
begged him to excuse me."
"You shunted him with never as much
as a suggestion of apology in your man
ner; and he stood and watched you across
the street, as amazed as if one of his
safest speculations had suddenly gono
wrong.'.'
"I'm very sorry; I'll amaze him with
apologies presently. Meanwhile, what's
the news? Have you found her?"
"Her! Whom?" replied Williams, with
well-acted surprise.
"Whom?" in his turn, repeated Glover.
"You know whom I mean."
"Oh! The woman who didn't require
your protection? No. I'm gplng to look
up the circus people. There's a new side
show down in Halsted street, with a
strong lady; breaks paving stones with
her fist, and " ,
"Then you don't mean to help me?" said
Glover, interrupting him, in an offended
manner.
"Help you?" replied the detective, rais
ing his eyebrows. "I didn't know you
were broke. I see now. Dexter wouldn't
part, eh?"
"You are not going to make me angry.
Williams." ! - ? -Â«
"Very well, then." replied the American.
"Just you follow Mr. Dexter, and tell him
what a fool you are. and meet me at the
Grand Palace to-night, and I'll tell you
you reached your homo last night?â or
rather, to be correct. I gues3 we had bet
ter say this morning?"
"Yes, sir. And what then?"
"I was a witness of the insult that was"
offered to you, and of the punishment yot
so skillfully administered to the ruffian
who profanes the name of man."
"Then why did you not save me the risk
and indignity of having to protect my
pelf?" said Zella. seeing that, even if she
had been inclined in prevaricate, the offi
cer had discovered her.
"You were too quick for both of us â
for the loafing thief as well as for mv
self."
"And there was another person on the
spot," she said with a smile; the color
that had paled when Williams declared
himself coming back to her cheeks and
with It her customary self-possession.
"You scorned his protection. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
He thinks you saved his life."
"You are making a romance of a very
trivial matter." she said, pleased at the
time to learn that the stranger considered
himself so deeply indebted to her.
"Your friends are leaving the club,"
paid Williams, as several ladies began to
pause at the exit. "I want you to be
good enough to give me your address;
and, furthermore, to appear against the
prisoner to-morrow."
"I will give you my address, but I will
not appear against the prisoner," said
Zella.
"Don't say you will not; that 13 as the
law may decide."
"No law shall make me appear, Mr.
Wijliams. bo assured of that. Is It not
bad enough that the police cannot keep
the streets free for a woman to pass
along without being molested, and, when
molested, one of their leading officers
looks on and leaves her to fight her own
way against a horde of ruffians?" said
Zella. hotly.
"My dear young lady, that is a most
unkind exaggeration, and you must not
speak to me in that way. Don't say you
will not do what I request; I can compel
you."
Williams was not angry, but he held It
diplomatic to appear fo.
"Very well, Mr. Williams," said the
young lady, altering her tone to one of
sweet appeal. "Dear Mr. Williams, I do
not wish to appear."
"Very well. Miss Brunnen." said the of
ficer after some hesitation and appeal on
the part of the girl; "it shall be as you
wish. W e will send Abner Digges to the
House of Correction without your evi

"Thank you, Mr. Williams: thank you
very much," said the girl, her eyes rest
ing on his with a grateful expression.
"I am repaid in having won the thanks
of so brave a lady." said Williams. "Good
day. Miss Brunnen."
"One moment, please. Mr. Williams.
How did you find me out? How came you

"Quite easily, Miss Zella. I knew you

"Why, certainly!" remarked tnÂ» bap

"That is exactly how we all feel. Mr.
Glencoe."
In the midst of this pleasant council of
friends and fellow boarders, the voice of
Mrs. Bridget O'Hagan could be heard, as
she was leaving her private parlor, evi
dently addressing a visitor.
"But bedad. I Insist! Any friend of:
Mlather Amos V. Storey Is welcome at
the bord of Bridget O'Hagan." .
"I can hardly say friend: I am In his

"Which is the more to yer hornier. It's

ABOUT.
HOW THE MEET1NT, WAS BROUGHT
It was Mr. Amos V. Storey, the editor
proprietor of the Daily Mall, who recom
mended Ned Glover to take a room at the
Parkside boarding-house. Neither hÂ» nor
Ned Glover had any Idea that Miss Brun
nen was domiciled under the roof of Mrs.
Bridget O'Hagan.
Since his coming thither was. therefore.
a mere accident, so far as his discovery
of Zella was concerned, it would seem as
if Fate had a hand in their meeting. Joe
Williams had told him that the lady who
had declined his protection on tho
memorable night in State street was Mr.
Hiram Dexter's typist. This had consider
ably disconcerted him. It had not blurred,
in his imagination, tne face he had seen
in the brignt rays of the electric lamps;
but It haa given an unhappy significance
to the confession of Dexter, and the moral
that was pointed thereon by Storey.
Glover had pleased his editor. There was
a feeling for color in his work. Hi3
pictures were not overladen with pigment,
but they sparkled, they were fresh, they
held the reader, they were the very best
form of Journalese. Glover's was an edu
cated pen; not the pen, however, for seri
ous editorials or argumentative essays,
but a pen that talked famfliarly. a pen
that saw and made the reader see: a pen
that could depict a landscape as sharply
as it could sketch a mob, that could tell
a humorous story as well as it could lay
in the heavy shadows of a tragedy. Storey
was pppreciatlve. and when Glover asked
the cashier for a certain amount of sal
erjr in advance, and the cashier referred
him to Storey, the editor-proprietor, while
not objecting, availed himself of the op
portunity to talk to him in a friendly way
about nis mode of life.
"The truth ia." satd Glover. "I find I am
spending more than I earn. I have not
had time to s< ek a modest lodging and
don't know where to lind one, if I had
leisure to seek it."
"You have worked hard and well," said
Storey, "and. if you have resolved to set
tle in Chicago. I think I can put you In
the way of a boarding house where you
will be fed as princes are supposed to be
fed. and taken care of with motherly ln
lerest."
"Not to heat about the bush, let mÂ« ai
vtse you to go straightway to the Park
side boarding-house. You'll have to cross
the bridge on the way to the water works,
then bear to the right. Mrs. O'Hagan is
an odd creature; called it Parkstde he
cause It's more lake-sldfl than park. But
that's a detail. 5?he thinks she is an Iriah
woman, but she's American: supports her
5dÂ»a of bting Irish by keeping up tho
brogue, and believing that she hate3 ev
erything ard everybody English. It's
quite Iriah to live in America and fight
imaginary battles for a land they've de
serted and r.evcF want to see again. I'm
half Irish myself, and know; but no
warmer hearted, pig-headed, lovable, con
trary. happy-50-lucky people ever existed
to make life romantic and politics the
scramble of a few for the hard-earned
dol'ars of tho many."
"I must interview you. Mr. Storey* on
'Ireland in America.' said Glover, amus
ed at Storey's description of the Irish
character. "It would mako a capital
sketch for the Sunday paper."
"Heaven forbid 'Â¦" says Storey. "I lovÂ©
the besrsars too much to run the risk of
hurting their feelings in the mass, though
it's fun to take them individually an.1
b>>at the Anglo-Saxon drum about their
ears."
"Almost thÂ«Â» only friend I h^ve In the
world is an Irishman," said Ned. "You
may have heard of him. He haa been oyÂ«Â»r
here once or twice in connection with
mining and trust companies. He is a law
yer; the firm is Straker, Love- & Lorrl
iner."
"A cute notion to get Love into the firm;
must seem encouraging to wouid-be suit
ors. No. I have never heard of your
friend that I can caM to r:!r.d."
"Lorrimer Is not exactly a young man,
though the junior partner. He woulil

It was love at first sight. Whoever has
not loved so. has not loved at all. To Zel
la there was a message to the stranger's
voice. It touched a responsive chord In
her heart, and at night awoke her la a
dream. In Ned Glover's soul, hitherto un
ruffled by even a breath of love, a pair of
eyes Ignited the smoldering tinder of a
young man's fancy, and afterward there
followed, with all speed, the flame of
Jealousy, to neutralize the first blissful
emotion.

"1 think 1 understand what Mr. Storey

â¢"Â¦Don't care lor my society, eh? Now,
I 'Â¦Â¦ was thinking how I'd kind of taken a

."I lave you ever been in England?"
"Never,- and yet the English money

"Are you? Why?"

Â¦While they were walking alÂ«ng the
rtrr-et rriany"hats were raised to Mr. Dex

Â¦'heartily returned. .â¢Â¦,
Â¦"If you were a borrowing man, Mr. Glo

On the other Fide of the road Joe Wil
liams, the detective, was passing, a flower
in his buttonhole and a contented smile
on his face.
"Excuse me, sir; I will rejoin you In a
minute or two," paid Glover, all the gold

"Well, well, old fellow, keep cool, said
Storey, rising and advancing towards
him. "Dash my boots, old man, I honor
your sentiments, and I respect the great
soldier's daughter. Shake!
They "shook," after which symbol of
friendship Dexter offered his cigar case,
first to Storey and then to Glover. While
they lighted up he chewed the end of his
weed, and, thrusting his hands Into his
pockets, walked about the room, not at
tempting to disguise his agitation.
"See here." he said, presently facing
them as they sat. Storey at his desk, Glo
ver by the window, "I may be a fool. It
is not given to every man to be always
ahead of his market. If I had met a Miss
Brcnnen, twenty or thirty years ago I
would have reckoned myself the luckiest
man in the United States If she would
have given me the right to protect her
and the privilege of being her slave. But
it was never my lot to meet a woman
I would have cared to marry. And now
I can only cherish the hope that I may
be a kind father to her. . . . But do
you think she will all>w me to do more
than employ her and pay her a fair wage?
No; by gosh! She is too independent even
to permit me to make her a present. She
Is as accomplished as she Is beautiful.
. . . I had never felt my loneliness â the
loneliness of an old bachelor â until she
entered my services as a clerk. . . .
That is the honest truth. . . . 3ust as
I loved and honored my mother, one of
the best women God ever put the breath
of life into, so do I feel toward this young
woman: this rrotherlÂ«-ss. this fatherless
child of America, a soldier's daughter.
. . . That's how it is with me. . . .
So let it go at that, you two. . . Excuse
me. now. ... I will see you later."
Thereupon he took up his hat and left
the place.
Storey looked at Glover. Glover looked
at Storey, as Dexter's retreating- foot
steps echoed along the corridor and the
outer door closed upon him.
"There's a fellow for you!" said Storey.
"The moral of which is. Mr. Glover, get
married while you're young, and don't
wait until sixty to contemplate the possi
bility of another man's happiness, when
you might have been blessed! Were you
ever in love. Mr. Glover?"
"Never, until a few hours ago."
"Why. what in thunder has come over
this office! How do you mean?
"I met her en the street at midnight."
"On the street: And at midnight!
. . . A nice confession!"
"It's true. I only saw her for an in
stant. Didn't know who she -was: don't
know now. A rufflan attacked her. I
went to her assistance. She felled the
brute with the dexterity of a pugilist and
fled."
"Is that a story you are getting up for
the Mail?"
"No, sir. It's a story I am getting up
for myself. But you will have a note of
it, no doubt, in your police reports for
tomorrow's paper."
"VÂ»"ho Is tte womaji, did vn " -Â«â¢"'"
Ings of tbe defeat of the Spanish fleet,
views of the Lakes of KlUarney, and a
picture (from the Illustrated London
News) of the blowing up of Clerkenwell
Gaol In London, with otner pictorial re
miniscences of the Irish revolt. Mr. Glen
coe, who was a Scotchman, and Mrs. Fer
guson, who hailed from Belfast, occasion
ally found it difficult to put up with Mrs.
O'Hagan's Fenian sentiments; but, as she
equally annoyed her American boarders
with her claims that America was only
"Ould Olreland, under another name,"
that Ireland had made tbe United States
and kept the country going, both sides goc
into the habit of smiling at the old lady's
extravagances.
Moreover, it was easy to be self-deny
ing in the matter of nationality and pa
triotism and the rest. In consideration of
the O'Hagan cuisine. A breakfast, for ex
ample, at the Parkside Boarding-house
was only equaled by the best restaurants
in the city. The bill of fare might be
more varied and Include a more numerous
array of side dishes, but Mrs. O'Hagan
presided over a meal that was not only
pleasant to the eye and comforting to the
olfactory sense?, but as whojesome as it
was dainty. She vowed that porridge was
an Irish dish. Indeed, everything that
anybody praised, anything that was
worthy of praise, was Irish. She declared
that tomatoes -were Irish: that cranberries
grew wild about Drogheda; that the
pumpkin was common enough In every
part of the "ould counthry"; that apples
grew on the hedges about Killarney;
while the lake was crowded with Spanish
mackerel, and the shore with terrapin!
Only Zella knew the dear old woman well
enough to observe the sly twinkle in her
eye as she made these declarations; and
/the stanchest American patriot would be
mollified at the tribute paid to the na
tional foods by the way in which they
were cooked and served. Tomatoes sliced,
with a small mountain of ice in their cen
ter: a fine dish of Spanish mackerel: a
preparation of chicken after the manner
of Virginia: sweet potatoes; squabs; hot
cakes; a fine bowl of fruits; and hot coffee
In a great, old-fashioned urn: a snow
white table-cloth: and what did It matter
whether Mrs. O'Hagan vowed that 'twas
the Irish won the victory of the North
against the South, or that she repeated
the libels of England's bitterest enemies
that the wounded dervishes at Omdurman
were tortured by Tommy Atkins.
"Did you hear of the street brawl,
ra'nm?" asked Mr. Glencoe when the
morning appetites of the boarders were
fairly well appeased, and they were tak
ing their coffee leisurely.
"I did that," was the reply.
"One paper says the woman was a lady,
though she struck the villain a blow that
knocked him down."
" 'Knocked the wind out of him," Is the
ipsissima verbat." said Mr. Glencoe.
"A vulgar affair, anyhow," was the
comment of the widow of a bartender,
who hnd retired on a small income and
cccun'ed Uie humblest of the Park-ide
night's adventure, and the hope that Wil
liams might have discovered her.
CHAPTER V.
LIAMS.
ZELLA AND MR. DETECTIVE WIL-
Zella Brunnen was the heroine of the
prize meeting at the Athletic Club; a Iier
oine among women, for only the members
of the c'.ub and their female friends were
permitted to be present.
Now. the case of Abner Digges Â¦was
postponed, on the application of Mr. De
tective Williams, for the attendance of
the chief witness:, whom he said he hoped
to produce on the following day. A\ hen
Glover accosted .him and was answered
with a rebuke; Williams was making his
way to the Women's Athletic Club build
ing, with no other clew than the handsome
face tÂ«f the strange illusive woman of State
street, and the something in her manner
that denoted Â»he lady, as he understood
the type, rather than the professional ath
lete, or circus girl, as he chose to reckon
her in order to tease Ned Glover.
When the trials of grace and strength
wore over, and Zella had been awarded
the two prizes for which she had con
tested, she retired to dress and go home
with Mrs. O'Hagan. That devoted slave
of friendship and motherly feeling Â«iad,
during Zel!a's> comi>etitlons. sat in a cor
ner of the gallery, exclaiming under h<?r
breatn snatcnes of Biblical invocations
and Anglo-Irish-American blessings on
her divine Z<?lla. Just as she was kissing
her and loading her with affectionate
congratulations in the vestibule Joe Wil
liams made his appearance.
"Beg pardon, lanies," he said; and the
girl turned toward him an inquiring face
â a face, once Been, not likely to be lor
gctten. Williams was counted one of the
most lucky men in the Chicago force. But
"Williams always gave his luck the sup
port of a shrewd intelligence and a never
resting energy.
"You don't remember me"" he said, with
a courteous bow.
"And if I don't." was the calm r-r-ly,
"perhaps you will inform me who you
are and why you have addressed us?"
"My name is Williams. I am a detec
tive officer."
"And phwat of It?" said Mrs. O'Hagan.
"Nothing obieclionable. I hope," he paid.
"Very well, then." answered Mrs. O'lia
gan; "phwat do ye want wid us?"
"I would like to speak with the young
lady for a few minutes."
"Then, spake." said Mrs. O'Hagan,
standing in a protecting attitude toward
Zc'la. who had Leon unable to disguise
her alarm.
*"It is a private matter." saUl Williams,
"There is nothing you may have to say
in me that Mrs. O'Hagan may not hear,"
Bald Zella.
"Does Mrs. O'Hagan know at what time
Women's Athletic Club."
"Very kind of you to know that I was
not a circus girl." said Zella. with a
mock curtsey. "And. by the way, who
was theâ t-r â the gentlemen who said, "If
he's a foreigner, then let a foreigner pro
tect you?' "
Williams smiled at the evident embar
rassment of the lady and at her recalling
the exact words of his friend.
"You remember his very words? he
said. - ,
"The occasion was rather remarkable,
she answered.
"He remembers your face just as acute
ly." said Williams, "and raves about your
eye's." , , ,,
"Then I don't want to know his name,
she said, hurriedly: "but I thank you
again. Mr. Williams. Come along. Mrs.
O'Hagun; dear; we shall be late."
"God be wid ye." Bald Bridget, nod
ding a quid: larewell to the detective and
taking Zella's arm a? they left the build
ing. Zella striving in vain to check a
blush that save an extra shade ot pink
to her Bunnj complexion.
In a private interview with the magis
trate and his clerk. Joe Williams had no
difficulty in having Miss Brunnen excused
from attending as u .witness against the
Iliftlun â¢
The magistrate, with quick .sympathy
for the gin. fell in with the young lady's
wis-h not to l>e called, and Abner DIgges
wiia sentenced to a month in the House of
Correction for being drunk and brawling
In the streets, and using a bowieknlfe to
tha common danger, etc. . .â¢ . Mr. Ed
mund Glover supported the evidence of
the detective and the sentence was the
more lenient that DIgges had evidently
onlv been in the town for a week and was
taking a vacation after many months of
prcspectirg and mining in Colorado. . . .
Dirges asked that his knife might be re
stored to him. It was, he said, a rare
blade, made for him way down in Ken
tucky, by a smith whose father had made
knifes for "the Bowles" in the old days.
. . . "When .->. man would have had
tweinty knives usainst him. if he had been
coward enough to draw upon a woman."
the magistrate had remarked; to elicit
the rejoinder from Digges that he
had not drawn upon a woman,
but upon that cursed kyote, who
called himself Glover;" nor did
ho believe, he said, that the individual
who had strurl' him was a woman, but a
man in woman's clothes; he'd lay a hun
dred that Glover was a "confederate of
the pugilist in petticoats." ... At
which Jud?o Koppel winked at the de
tertive and 'riughed. . . . And, when
i he prisoner bad been removed, the Judge
Faid, "She h:\s not studied'the noble art'
for nothing, this Mips Zella Brunnen; a
wolf in Bheep's clothing couldn't have
surprised liini more. I guess. And that's
all about the circus gal. If you don't
square things with Dexter, and keep your
position pn the Chicago Daily Mail, you
can wipe me off your visiting list. Under
stand." .
Williams hailed a passing car, and
waved his newly made friend a parting
salute. Glover, biting the ends of his
mustache, crossed the road and entered
the office of the Mail.
"Go right in," said the Janitor who
guarded the editorial portals.
"Mr. Dexter, 1 beg you will accept my
abject apologies for leaving you abtupily.

i attnt automatic desk, that was loophoiect
with dra\seia,ar.d echoed the tick of an
aujin-ent tape, that was telling him tho
latest news from London. Berlin, Paris
and HoEkosh, with Impartial indifference.
"You gave me the go-uy, as one mlgnt

Dexter, tilting an easy chair in which he
was seated against the wall, and contem

Athlete Unable to Lift Him.
One of the most interesting exhibitions
given by Mack during his stay in Boston
was conducted at the Charlesbank Gym
nasium. Here his feats were a source of
astonishment to the athletes that frequent
that popular outdoor resort.
achievements. Hi? extraordinary control
over his pulse has mystified them. He can
increase pulsation up to a flutter or de
press it to a point so low that it cannot
be detected.
One of the most astounding feats ac
complished by t2.is young New Yorker
is the test on the beam scales. Hack can
actually reduce his. weight or increase It
at will while standing on the scales. This
experiment Is conducted by simply allow

with Mack's full permission the doctor
tried repeatedly to hypnotize the young
man, but without su:cess. He did. how
ever, achieve partial control over his sub

from llftins him. When almost overcome

power over his subject.
Dr. Charcot, the noted French specialist
who first used hypnotism in connection
with his surgical work, became Interested
in Mack, and when the American arrived
In Paris he at once, with the consent of
Mr. Mack, conducted a series of what he
called "scientific tests of Invisible
strength."
Mack does not believe, as has been fre
quently claimed, that he causes a partial
paralysis of the nerve centers. His belief
finds support in the fact that the Boston
athletes who have lifted or tried to lift
him have complained afterward that they
not only lifted but lifted so hard that they
strained muscles that were thought to be
eo well trained that no amount of exer
tion could make them sore. No one who
has ma.de theaests will admit that he did
not exert his full strength.
In Berlin Professor Virchow made a
three weeks' study of Mack. Every after
noon several hours were spent In the
latoratory of that famous scientist. After
these experiments Virchow gave it as hi?
opinion that Mack exerted a "force of
nerve resistance." Just what the learned
professor meant by this is understood gen
erally only in a vague way.
On the Continent the scientists who had
been reading for a year the articles in the
English medical journals and periodicals
devoted to things psychological were
ready to make examinations, and they at
once began a series of notable tests.

Mack placed his index fingers on tha

test, but the force did not seem to get be

Standing four deep the first man placed
h!s hand en Mr. Mack's neck. Each
man behind him assumed a similar posi
tion, so that there was a chain of the neck,
touching operation to the end of the line.
Four men then tried to push Mack
through a plate glass window across the
street from the Charles Bank. Some hes-^
itation on the part of the experimenters
brought forth the question as to who was
to pay for the window. Without waiting
to settle this question the attempt was
made. Â¦Â¦Â¦'.Â¦ . .

"It seemed to me," said one of them,
"that when I started to lifting I would
feel something in him pulling down. I
could feel It steadily dragging me down."
This time Mack's feet stayed flat on tho
floor. The men exerted themselves to tho
utmost. Back and forth they swayed an.l.

ger never left the neck of the man In

were where he grasped the hands of two

make the dog move a. muscle. A low.
piteous whine escaped him and Mack
lifted t!ie finger from the canine's neck
and the pup bounded av. - ay, as 1( de

After conducting a few experiments
himself the elder Mack called the atten
tion of Dr. Marlon L. Simms, a specialist,
who was at that time the family phy
sician, to the discovery he had made. Dr.
Simms at once conducted a series of ex
periments and among other things found
that the lad could transmit the mysterious
power through direct application only. He
never made public his theory as to what
the gift really was.
After leaving school young Mack was In

One day his father was displeased w"th

The trouble the bey had caused the Har

"When the father attempted to carry the
youth into the house he felt the boy's>

was unable to lift him from the ground.
He repeated the effort several times and
the application of the shingle was for

William Mack has been doing this Â«soit
of thing since he was five yrars old. He
has had many curious experiences. Th.2
discover}* was an accident-

Â¦was demonstrated when he had the foot

then, by simply placing a finger on the

use an expression overheard, "to weigh

Lots of suggestions were made, but
none of them was practical. The question
arose as to whether Mack could teach
any one else how to exert the strength
or power, and thoughts of having him
engraved as a trainer were abandoned
â¢when he said that he could not teach them
how he did the things they had seen, or
even explain them. The only way he could
transmit the power to a second person
Â¦was v/hen he was within reach.
"If we 'had a man like that on the tears

WILL William H. Mack succeed In

regarded as an unsolvable phe
nomenon by some of the leading: scienti&is
cf this cour.try and Kurope. He is only

yet by seme strange power he delles ;ha

firar.ge thing about Mack's mysterious
power is that he hiir.self oannot under

Professor Virchow, -iean of the Univer

and the answer to it is obtained
much more readily than Is possi

deadly peril through some of the
common accidents of life. J. Crow
tner Hirst, an Englishman, has written
a book detailing the experience of big
game hunters and others while under the
attack of wild beasts. He relates the adven
ture of Lieutenant Vanderzee with an African
lion, one of three which were found by the lieu
tenant's party. The lions were 400 yards away
and one of them, being shot in the hind leg. turnl
ed and made for its assailant. As it approached
-It received two other bullets in the chest,
which failed to stop its advance. It threw the
Lieutenant to the ground, bit him severely on
the legs and arms, and then-but not till then
-It died of the wounds it previously had re
ceived. Lieutenant Vanderzee says: "I had
no feeling of pain whatever, although there
was a distinct feeling of being bitten-that
is, I was perfectly conscious, independently
of seeing the performance, that the lion was
gnawing at me, but there was no pain. To
| show that the feeling or, rather, the want
c of it. was in nowise due to excessive ter

"I most certainly felt the most awful
pain I have ever experienced -when aha
was biting my neck, but not afterward,
as far as I can remember. The old mili
tary doctor who attended me mentioned
the case of Dr. Livingstone, and said that
he thought the pain I felt was due to tha
fact of the nerves all* meeting In tho neck.
I felt none of my other wounds at tho
time, but they were painful afterward."
S. T. Hansard of Ceylon had a conflict
with a man-eating tigress which had been
the scourge of the neighborhood. He and
a friend went to seek her, each taking a
different side bf a certain ravine. Mr.
Hansard says: "I suddenly felt what
seemed to me for the moment to bÂ» a
man's hand on each of my shoulders, Uk9
a heavyweight playing leap frog. Glanc
ing over my. left shoulder I saw, to my
horror, the open mouth of a huge tiger
within an inch of my neck. Then all was

say, but I believe that it 13 a fact that In
mest cases the victim has been struck;
Bfr.seless with the first flap of the paw.
The next thing I remember was slipring
down the ravine with my head downward,
my face to the ground, and the tigresa on
my back, biting my neck. The agony I
felt wa3 something fearful; my whole
skull felt as if it was being crunched to
atoms in the Jaws of this great brute.
Twice the Jaws seemed to meet and I
thought it was all up. The next thing I
it-member was a sudden relaxation, feel
ing the brute off my back, and seeing her
roll down toward the stream.
E. C. S. Baker. F. Z. S., tells of a wt>
man who was attacked by a man-eating
tiger, but suffered no pain, although she
was bitten twice through the muscles of
the arm; also of a man bitten through the
neck and shoulder, who . dlÂ«*d In three
days, but suffered no pain at all. either at
the time of the bite or afterward; also of
another man bitten through the thigh,
who suffered no pain at the time, but en
dured agonies afterward. * ,"Â¦.-. . Â¦;
The Rev. J. G. Kerry, a Baptist mission
ary in Bengal, tells an odd story about an
engineer on the Assam-Bengal Railway
who went out after a tiger that had done
much damage. He found it. but his gun
missed fire, and before he could fire again
the tiger was upon him and knocked him
down. The tiger at once began to crunch
the man's right arm, whereupon, although
he felt no pain at the time, he gave tho
tiger a severe blow In the face with his
left. Strange to say, the tiger was so dis
concerted that he walked away.
Mr. Hirst gives several Instances of
wounds Inflicted by bears, and In every
instance the testimony of the wounded
man is that he was not conscious of pain.
One says: "I was not conscious of any
pain, though severely bitten." Another
writes: "In the moment of desperate
struggle for life the intense excitement
and anger did, as a matter of fact, render
me insensible to the feeling of actual pain
as the bear gnawed my left hand, Â¦which
was badly torn and perforated with holes,
most of the bones being broken." In an
other case there was no pain, and the pa
tient afterward said that he felt "as If
the bear had simply hold of hla trousers, '
In another case the man's courage failed
him when the bear sat up. His face bones
were smashed and his face lacerated, but
he "did not feel any pain while being
mauled." . t
An Indian sportsman who had killed
many wild beasts thus records his dreams
In the days that followed one particularly
frightful experience. He says: "I well
remember how, in my frightful dreams,
the panther constantly came at me again
and how fiercely I struggled to get my
hands and feet (which I imagined tied)
free, and how ultimately I awoke, bathed
In perspiration, having got rid of my hor
rible nightmare."
Mr. Inverarity says that four men have
been seized by tigers either In his Imme
diate presence or when he was close by.
In one instance this was what happened:
"Ponce came acros3 a man who had been
seized by a man-eater by the nape of the
neck. Strange to say. he recovered. He
was the last of a single file of several vil
lagers, and on the tiger seizing him his
companions turned and drove the tiger off
him. He was insensible and had no Idea
when he came to his senses what had
happened to him."
Mr. Inverarlty, speaking of his personal
experience with a Hon. says: "So large
an animal coming at full speed against
you of course knocks you off your legs.
The claws and teeth entering the flesh do
not hurt as much as you would think.
The only really painful part of the busi
ness Is the squeeze given by the Jaws on
the bone. I felt none of the dreamy stu
por Livingstone describes, but. on the
contrary, felt as usual. I never felt tho
slightest shock."
The lion by which Dr. Livingston* was
attacked crunched the bone of his arm
into splinters and had left eleven teeth
wounds upon It; yet the doctor declare:!
that he had "no sense of pain nor feeling
of terror."
I saw through the dense smoke In which
I was enveloped the form of the lion
standing almost above me. Instinctively
I prepared to kick him off, and finding;
myself, as It seemed, uninjured, I sprang
to my feet with some Idea of clubbing him.
with my rifle, now empty, when I found
he had bolted. I was considerably splash
ed with blood and my hand felt power
less. I was bitten in two places, ons
wound being, as I was Informed, through,
and he had clawed my left elbow, tearing

though Protestantism had been one of the
strings upon the Queen's marriage at the
time her partial freedom descended upon
her.
What the Hollanders' thought had nothing
to do with the matter. "I shall marry for
lovÂ» -*nd not for ptate reasons," she repeat-
trothal. The pala banquet never came off
and Wilhelmina's cousin William is still
her <ousln, no more.
He was a jolly boy, but that was as
much aa she would grant. She did not
consider his horsemanship more graceful
than other men's.
"His nose is too long," she complained,
And then in the next breath she would
declare that good looks counted for noth
ing In the choice of a husband.
"She doesn't know her own mind two
minutes In succession," whispered the
family, and the whisper crept to court
circles and on and on until society hid
It behind fans and peasantry clacked It
over milk pails.
"The Queen doesn't know her own
mind. She flirts."
"Take my word for It. she'll never
marry; that kind never does,", prophe
sied an inhabitant of the flat lands.
â¢ Tho^e that play are played with. It's
the punishment she deserves. She'll grow
old and fat and nobody will have her
then."
"But a Queer* never grows too old to
marry," argued another matron of the
flat lands.
"Do you suppose that being a Queen will
keep her young? Her figure is not so good
as my Anna's now and by the time she Is
Â£? she'll be a fright. Anna digs in the
turnip patch every morning to keep her
weight down, but there's no turnip patch
around the palace for the Queen, poor
thing."
So for want of a turnip patch Wil
helmina continued to employ three maids
at her laces and the result was so suc
cessful that her twenty-one and a half
inch waist continued to excite admiration.
Her leported engagement to 'William of
Wied satisfied the public for a month and
sixteen days and then came a new an
nouncement. The Frankfurter Zeitur.g
gave forth the news in May that Prince
Alexander of Teck was rumored to be the
fortunate man. This whisper was copied
until it became a spoken word and it
grew in volrme from a shout to a roar.
Alexander seemed so probable a choice
that ?ome time was accorded him by the
public and it was not until October that
the papers chose Joachim Albrecht to be
Prince Consort.
Wilfcelmina has not chosen him, though.
She had no more thought of him than of
any of the other?, so far as appears now.
She handled him very much as a cat does
a mouse, and she treated other lovers no
better.
If only the remote public talked, people
would not blame WHhelmina, perhaps.

at last.
She has laid her net for all the
eligible crowns of a continent, and she
has captured most of them. Now she is
to find out herself how the meshes feel.
TVHhelmlna Is a leap year girl. Not that
she Is a brazen missâ don't think itâ but
by reason of her queenship she has to do
the proposing. So all the suitors who are
moping within range of her flouts are
waiting, not for the answer, but for the
question.
She has played with every Prince and
Duke that comes her way. She has lured
them on to dare for her, to die for her.
Some were better men and some were
worse for knowing her; at any rate, all
were baffled.
All. until Prince Adolph came along. He
Is Adolph Frederick of MeCklenburg-
Schwcrin. Prince of a long name and an
old one. He knew that all the reÂ»t had
tried and failed, but that was no reason
why he should give up. He wasn't that
kind. Ncr did he set Welhelmlna down
as a heartless wretch because sh*. had
met fire with ice.
"She can't marry everybody Just to be
obliging," he said.
He decided that she had as much heart
as ar.y other girl, and that all she wanted
was the rifht man.
He proved himself correct.
Wilhelmina has for two years been the
reigning Queen of Holland. She was 13
years old when the crown was placed
upon her head and the report thereof
p pread over the world and her pictures
went along' with the story. Everybody
knew that she had come of age and had
been crowned, and they knew just what
she wore and how she looked and how all
the royal family looked, too. But noth
ing was written at that time about all the
fun she was getting ready to have.
"As soon as I come of age, I shall do
what I please," she had threatened a
thousand times when an altercation be
tween her and her mother resulted in a
slammed door and a storm of words flung
against it.
"In a year I shall be my own mistress,"
the cried at IT.
"In a month you will not dare say I
shall wear alpaca instead of silk," she
fumed later.
Then it grtw to be three weeks and then
two, and finally only seven days were left,
when a difference of opinion resulted in
strong expressions from both parties. It
was on this occasion that the Queen told
Wilhelmina she had never had a- graceful
carriage, one really befitting a Queen.
Wilhelmina replied, "Heredity is re
sponsible for so much."
The 31st of August came after plenty of
waiting and the new Queen stepped out
more than ever before the public eye. She
was ready for her good time, and she be
ga.n it as soon as the tiresome ceremonies
were over. She flirted, it is said, on her
way home from the coronation, and she
has kept it up ever since.
In August, '58, she was proclaimed
Queen. During the fall and winter fol
lowing court gossips were kept buzzing
like a hive of bees, as the young Queer
beckoned here with a fan, tethered there
Â¦with a smile. Now and then came a

"Trust her not; she is fooling

The Duke of Abruzzi was one
that could not- be fooled with, peo
ple said. He was none of your
drawing-room ornaments, none of
your figurehead officers, they ex
plained. He was a real man, who
did not depend upon his title for
distinction. His love for the girl
Queen brought out all the man in
him.
She has always said that sho
should marry for love, and that she
could never love a toy man. And
for this the young Duke of Abruzzl
plowed his way through Arctia

their Queen should not. He was
the bravest of all her suitors, and
he was an Italian besides, which

of singing. But voice alone would be of
little value to the young student for op
eratic honors. A national conservatory
that would hi of any use to beginners In
the field of music would have to Include
in its staff of teachers not only professors
who knew thoroughly the . voice and Its

at once that the King was in uniform. '
"Why," he exclaimed unhesitatingly In
pretty much the same tone he had used
to the chamberlain, "I said I didn't want
to paint your Majesty in uniform!"
"I Heard nothing about It," declared the
King, with a glance of surprise at ihe
indiscreet artist.
"Well, well well!" muttered Zorn while
he put his easel In order. "But then I'll
tell your Majesty something. If I have
to paint your Majesty In uniform I shall
have to charge my large price."
"How much is that?" Inquired the royal
customer.
"It Is 25.000 francs, your Majesty." ex
plained Zorn. "But If your Majesty will
change clothes I'll only charge my small
price, which Is 10,000 francs."
"Well." mused the King, trying to look
very serious, "that's a very big sum

Â«. national conservatory established on
proper lines would do a great deal for the
young aspirant for vocal honors In assist
ing 'her to iind out definitely what line of
professional work she Is best equipped to
undertake. It is a gradual processâ this
finding out. The singer learns her points
of strength and weakness as she pro
gresses in her studies. It is at this criti
cal stage of her career that a good teacher
can be of great value in guiding her steps.
Physique, temperament, health, dramatic
instinctâ all these must be regarded in
choosing one's special line of work as well
as vocal equipment and inclination.
I can easily' illustrate this from my own
experience. When I went abroad to study

this novitiate of a singer's art It is only
because I want to Impress on the young
aspirant the fact that to be successful she
must persevere and work, work, always

witn a mind entirely to snch lates
choice of specialty as developing condi
tions should leave open to me. I wanted
to become a prima donna of the opera, of
course, but I resolved from the very first
that If experience should demonstrate tho
impossibility of fulfillment of that ambi
tion I would willingly and cheerfully turn
my entire energies into whatever other
channel my equipment seemed best adapt
ed to suit. I would become an oratorio
or a concert singer if I found that I was
better adapted for one of these profes
sions than for the hard and longed for
line of work first chosen. I resolvedâ
and I adhered to these resolves through,
all the long, dull, hard years of prepara
tory workâ that if I were obliged to turn
to oratorio or the concert platform I
would work just as hard and Just as per
sistently to perfect myself for either as
I would in case my operatic ambition
turned out to be not entirely unjustified.
That is just the first part of the road
which every singer must travel toward
success. It is the discipline of the soul,
of the mind, and the rewards of It come,
but after long waiting, if at all. And even
after success has been achieved there i3
still mere hard work ahead. T,he acquisi
tion of new roles, the constant study to
retain them all when one has already
memorized many roles; the earnest desira
of every true artist to broaden and per
fect her conception of every part in her
repertory, to constantly improve her ex
ecution and dramatic Interpretation â these
are seme of the necessities not to be for
gotten, neglected or set aside even after
success and fame have come to reward
the long and arduous struggle of prep
aration. The prima donna dare not for a
single moment rest upon her laurels. ShÂ»
But artists who are proud of what they
Vi.-i- done in their careers would never
be willing to go through the amount of
wire-pulling and ceremony necessary to
pet those places. They would not stoop
to It. So the result Is that those In the
various departments are there more be

Some of them can teach finging. But
the Instructors In the Conservatoire
should be the great singers who have had
their careers and, above all. are able to
give young students who want to learn
how to sing on the stage the benefit of
their own experience.
I. have seen a great deal of the work
ings of the Paris Conservatory, and I wish
I had Influence enough to undertake a re
formation of certain abuses that exist in
that institution to-day. It Is absurd to
think that of all the professors in the
Conservatoire, a very small percentage of
them have ever been on the stage. None
of the teachers of singing there has ever
made a success in opera or had any expe
rience that would qualify him to teach
singers what they should do in order to
prepare themselves for the operatic s>tag<-.
But before the finishing process is neces
sary, the linger must have gained abso
lute mastery of all the muscles of the
throat, tongue and chest which produce
and control the tones. The young stu
dent must have so studied and practiced
these muscleii that he or she can depend
upon them as certainly as upÂ«yi the ear
for absolute accuracy of tone production.
A good singer must be ablo to "feel" a
tone as well as to hear It. This can only
be gained by an infinity of toll and pains,
and then the singer need never bother
about the size or shape of the room she
pir.gs in. She will know absolutely her
tones, however they may return to her
distorted by poor acoustics of the theater
or concert-room.
The "finishing" of a voiwâ the educa
tion In facility and brilliancy of execution
â would have to be left to whatever teach
er is moft proficient in the handling of
the type of organ which the student has
developed under the first teachers.
To have a voice wrongly posed Is a mis
fortune which is almost a tragedy, so dif
ficult is the correction of the basic error.
To have the voice correctly posed in the
beginning makes the subsequent acquisi
tion of range, volume, style and brilliancy
matters only of constant work.
Uut there are good teachers in America
â excellent ones; I do not know them, but
pome of the young voices I haye heard In
American cities are excellently posed, and
showed the effects of completeness and
conscientious instruction.
I do not know many American teachers
who could be secured for the conserva
tory. 1 have in mind, and I know but few
in Europe whom I would care to recom
mend for this most vital foundation work
cf voice culture. To pose a voice, one
must be equipped with knowledge, expe
rience and temperament to start the
young students aright and to teach them
all the mysteries of the voice and the
thousar.d delicate muscles and vibratory
chords which control it.
But this is not enough. America has
r.ot reached the stapo where it can afford
to have a Minister of Fine Arts, and
therefore it is almost useless to hone for
e conservatory of music endowed by the
Government. Still, however. It seems to
me that in lieu of an official subsidy a suf
ficient amount of money could be raised
by private subscription to assure the
fuccess of the enterprise. There is no
country that spends more money for mu-
Fic than America does, but it requires the
best. AVhcn you consider the fact that
the subscription for the last season of
grand opera in New York amounted to
nearly SiiX'.OOO. it would seem that a num
ber of wealthy and public spirited citizens
could cas'.ly band themstJves to found a
school of music worthy of the name-
It would take a volume to enumerate
all the benefits of a good conservatory of
music. The greatest obstacle in my mind
in carrying cut such en enterprise to a
successful iff'Je would be in securing a
staff of efficient teachers. These would
rave to be selected with the greatest care.
for upon thtlr intelligence, honesty and
careful individual guidance everything de
pends. The prerequisite to any vocal de
velopment is the "posing" of the voice,
and that is the most essential thing to the
young aspirant for vocal honors.
It is for this reason that I have always
advocated the foundation of a national
conservatory of music in this country. Of
course, I thoroughly realize all the obsta
cles that present themselves in organiz
ing an institution that would compare fa
vorably with some of the European con
servatories. Mrs. Jeanette Thurber has
done some pood work in this direction.
and the school she founded in Xew York
has even received official recognition from*
the American Government.
NOWADAYS an exacting public asks
. much from singers. Not only tltet
they should have a fise voice, but
also that they should bring brains
behind the voice to carry it en, to sup
port it, to round the career of the artist.
Indeed, we have come to this, that pure
intelligence and fine, sensitive, dramatic
capacity sometimes go for more than the
grandest voice treated merely as a ve'ee.

room he had determined upon a course of
action. He must go away. His young
blood, his Impulsive r.ature. his intense
love, all made It irn:)os?lb!e for him
calmly to settle down to study. He had
heard of the discoverv cf go.d in Cali

The old ?cen?s could not brmg anything

Across the street from the academyâ

The house stood close to the pavement,
and waa separated from the academy by
a large yard. The hou^e was locked, and
there was no response to the knocker.

thought. "Til "ust ilrop in and see her

After that first call he found himself
trying- to remember every word that the
beautiful Cr.rolir.e had said and manufac
turing excuses that would take him to tho
house. He recognized the symptoms and
knew that he was In love. Miss Scott also
knew before many days had elapsed and

the subject. Jenkins was as impulsive ass

Among the bevy of demure, little Puri

The roprbud garden of girls." Those who
r<-m<-mbpr her remember that she was a

States. {Tor it was Benjamin Harrison
who v;rn Miss Caroline Scott and succeed
ed, while hin rival, with as glowing pros
pects in tarty manhood, lost his suit;
and. aritta that loss, the fire of ambition
le't him, the glowing coals died out while
he lived en.
The rivals were equipped for life in
the ssse college â Miami University at
Oxford. Ohio â early in the fifties. John
W. Scott had a professional role In the
university a:id was also manager and
president cf a young ladles' academy in
the town of Oxforii.
He did not make the mark In the world
entitled him. but If his great love was so
much stronger than his other ambitions
we can only pity the helplessness of the
situation. . xV Inver whose devotion goes
on unchansin* for over half a century has
a fidelity In his character which, had It
bfen otherwise directed, might have been
of great service to the world.
Every ray of brightness faded out of his
life, and with it vanished every hope and
ambition for the great future of a great
can. Again he crossed the plains to work
and forget in California, Ever restless,
he turned to otner goldflelds and scenes.
Fortune followed and smiled again, but
what did he care for gold? Only that it
might contribute to the pleasure of others
Therefore, the generosity of this great
heart permitted those about him to enjoy
life In his stead. He found an artificial
glow, however. In his wines, and, as he
went on toward the afternoon of life, he
cared little for consequences and looked
for solace In his cups.
A lonely little wayside inn was finally
selected by Ben Jenkins as a resting place
In his old ase. Few people came along
that quiet road and he could easily do the
honors of host and act as chef as well.
The busy little town of Redding was
shocked a few days a^o. however, by the
arrival of a courier who said that old
Ben Jenkins had b<Â»*n found dead In his
brrt on the mnrninsr of October 12.
So. the llvlr.s death is over and the
tragedy of one more life Is finished. This
Romeo was brave enough to live and face
despair, which require* Infinitely more
courage than to die and *Â»nd it all. Ben
Jenkins lived on as rwst he could "to see
the came out." na he exprrssed It. and
looked on Indifferently to the close. -
Few people will ever know what Ben
Jenkins suffered. These who can under
stand deserve much pity, for such natures
must have the same capacity for pain
themselves.
"The hearts of some women, like leaves.
arc stirred by every breath of love which
reaches them, and then are still again;
other hearts, like the waves of the ocean,
are moved only by the force of a stojin
and are not so easily lulled to rest."
And he knew that she belonged to this
latter class.
Once alone, he Installed himself In a
room in the little tavern and read the
particulars about Cnrrle Scott's marriaco
to h!s rival. He read that the wedding
was a very quiet one, attended by. only
a few intimate friends of noth families.
The Harrison family had com? up from
North Bend for the occasion, with tho
exception of the widow of General Wtl-
Hara Henry Harrison, she beir.s too feeble
at the time to take the journey. The
ceremony had been performed by the
bride's father in her own home. The
newspaper' article described the couple
standing In ono co-ner of the spacious
parlor, the bride attired in a soft gray
traveling suit and the groom in bfack.
He read further that they had gone for a
little trip, which wou.d Include the old
Harrison homestead at North Bend, and
that later they would begin their new Ufa
at Indianapolis, where Benjamin Harri
son intended to build up a law practice.
Jenkins knew that ' his rival had grad
uated in June of 1=32 and left the town to
finish his law cours?. Then Carrie Scott
must certainly have Joved him to have
waited nearly a year and a half for him
to return and take her as a helpmeet, be
ginning life as they were obliged to with
many privations.
"Did you know that Carrie Scott wa3

You . were always pretty close to thÂ©
throne. Now. weren't you? Do you know.
Jenkins, I always felt dead certain you
iwo would make a match. I'm a pretty
close observer myself, and think I have
pretty good reason to believe you think
your eyes of her. Now. on the square.
Jenkins, isn't It a bad case with you? OC

way or the other. It's a matter of no

How Een Jenkins disposed of his In

nished to the Associated Press to-night the following statement, giving "the outlook fpr Tuesday from the Republican
standpoint: "Our latest, advices from New York are conclusive that the State will give a large majority for McKinley.
Local conditions in Greater New York, better known to the country, will Increase Mr. Bryan's vote In the metropolis, but
we believe that a majority for McKlnTey in the State is a most conservativoiestlmate. Lately there has been some ques
tion as to the result in Maryland. -Mr. Bryan's visit to that State proved injurious to his cause, and there has been In
the last three weeks a great revival of feeling among sound money Democrats, and especially in Baltimore which pre
sages a majority for McKinley of between SOOO and 10,000.
"As to Ohio, while there will be some losses in Cuyahoga County and in Cleveland, and perhaps one or two large cities,
this will be made up in the rural dlstrcts of the State. We predict with the greatest confidence a larger majority In the
State than was given in 1S96. Undoubtedly Indiana, has bf-en the great battleground In the States' of the Middle West.
Every vote has been thoroughly contested. The Republicans will suffer losses in a' few of the larger cities, but there will
be gains amorg the farmers and thf f.rst voters of the young men. Developments show that the young men of the State
are almost unanimously supporting McKinley. It Is understood In Indiana that the majority for the Republican ticket
will ho in excess of 20,000. VÂ£ '-V-
"In the Rocky Mountain States, those that four years ago were almost solidly for free silver, there has been a revolu
tion in public sentiment, and it will not be surprising if all. or nearly all, of them reverse their positions of four years ago
It Is as certain as anything can be that Kansas. 'Wyoming, South Dakota and Washington will be carried by the Republ
Means by decisive majorities, and the States of Nebraska, Utah and Nevada are more likely to'give their votes to Mc-
Kinley than to Bryan. \ Â£* ;." .â¢;. ."â¢.-Â¦

question whether the Democrats, acting under the provisions of the Infamous Goebel law, will be able to steal it."
CHICAGO, Nov. 3.â Chairman Jones of the Democratic National Committee. furnished to the Associated Press to
night the following statement "covering the outlook from his standpoint:
"The fight is won. Bryan and Stevenson will be elected.' The Democratic majority. In'the electoral college will be
ample. The Democrats will hold all > the States they carried in 180C. with the possible exception of Wyoming. We will
also carry New York. New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland. West Virginia, -Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio- and' Illinois. The
chairman "of the State committee of California has just wired me ' that we will' carry, ithat! State l^y 10,000 â¢ majority.
Jn a general way, I wonld say that there will be somewhat of ,a falling off In Bryan's vote compared! with 18S6 west of
the Mississippi, and: that east of the Mississippi he will make overwhelming gains.- The campaign has been a spirited one
from the start. The Democrats were somewhat, handicapped for want of funds, Awhile*, the Republicans, as four years
ago, had more. money than they could use. J The Republicans have endeavored to intimidate laboring men and alarm
business men, but not with the fierce opposition they -brought to bear In 11896. It : is i my opinion "that' intimidation has
been a" failure this year, and that both workingmen and 'business men will' vote accordingto the dictates of conscience.
Of course the trusts, the great aggregations of. combined: capital, the seekers 'for : franchises In Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines, the prompters and. exploiters generally^ have spared no effort, and will spare no effort, to re-elect McKinley. It*
Is my firm belief, however, that the electorate cannot.be debauched this year -to a sufficient extent to throttle the pub
lic will. The country- is aroused as It has never been' since 'the days preceding, the civil (war. The "existence of the

CRY OF "FRAUD" :
FROM PARTY THAT
IS ITS SPONSOR
CHICAGO. Nov. 2.â Congressman
Babcock. chairman of the Republi
can Congressional Campaign Com
mittee, gave to the Associated
Press to-night the following state
ment covering the expectations of
the Republicans as to the next
House: â
"The Congressional campaign has
reached a point where the only
question Is the size of the Republi
can majority. In the statement
given to the press on the 2Sth'I said
that the Republican membership
would not be less than 1S7. This
number I considered at the time
was sure beyond any reasonable
doubt. Since then conditions have
continued to Improve. The Croker-
Jones advice to Democrats suggest
ing fraud by the Republicans has
done us much good, for no one can
point to a single instance where a
Republican member has been elect
ed by fraud either In the votes cast
or the count after they were cast;
while the majority of the Demo
cratic representation In the House
comes from districts where the Re
publican vote Is driven from the
polls by the shotgun, or If In any
cases it is cast it is counted for the
Democratic candidate and the will
of the people defeated. This cry of
wolf coming ' from the party that
stands sponsor for fraud of the
worst' type will be resented at the
polls. And I have every reason, to
believe that fully 200 Republicans
will be elected to the Flfty-seventli
Consrrcss. J. W. BABCOCK."

Nearly seven hours later the last di

cold, raw wind for the formation to move.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the head of the

"We run up against some people with
odd notions," said a suburban real estate
man; "we certainly do. I had a man out
looking at houses last spring, a moony
sort of a chap he was. but a nice man.
and I tried hard to nail him; I thought
he'd be an addition to the community,
and I thought I'd got him finally, but then
he said he'd have to see how things were
there at night. Now that, you know, was
the oddest request I had had in the course
of a long experience. There was the house
and there was the- country: better seen by
day and by night, and what he should
want to see it at night for I couldn't even
guess. But. of course. I said all right,
and he came out from the city again the
'same night and we went around to the
house that he was looking at and sat
down on the veranda.
' "It was a beautiful moonlight night, full
moon. Our place had never looked so
lovely, and I thought it was a question of
when we'd sign the lease, but pretty soon
the man says:
" 'No bugle!'
"Well, now do you know you could have
knocked me down with a broom splint?
Easy. Because it was only that day that
I'd .got rid of a bugler, and here was a
man who wanted to hear one. We'd had
In our town probably the worst suburban
bugler that ever was; a man who could
play 'Oft in the Stilly Night' and that
sort of thing on a key bugle in a way to
make people go Into the house and shut
all the doors and windows on the hottest
summer nights. To my great delight this
man had moved away that very day; and
now here was a man that wanted to hear
him!
"You can never tell. Here was this man,
nice a man as ever was, but chock full of
romantic notions. Freak notions, you and
I would call 'em â maybe we've got some
that he'd call freak notions. But anyhow
he'd lived in the suburbs somewhere be
fore, where he'd heard the familiar key
bugle that you always hear in these
places, played by somebody in the dis
tance; and he'd got the sound of that dis
tant bugle Indelibly associated In his mind
with pleasant memories of suburban life.
The moonlight and that sort of thing
didn't seem right without the bugle. He
missed It and I had to do some quick
thinking. .
" 'We've got the greatest player here
that ever -was,' I said to him. 'but it just
happens that he's gone to the city to
night. You'd hear him here, though, to-
morrow night, no doubt. If you should
happen around.
" 'Well, I think I'll come,' he says, 'be
cause I must say I rather like this place,
and if the bugler seems natural I'll take
this house.'
"There was a friend of mine that played
a B flat cornet In a band in the city and
I got him out the next day and instaliul
in the house that our local bngler ha...
as I thought so happily, left. It was an
other beautiful night, simply beautiful,
the moon plumb full, a little fuller if any
thing than it was the night before; and
my prospective house renter was even
more impressed than he had been by thÂ«
beauty of the place; and it all rested now
with my friend with the B flat cornet:
and when night had fairly settled ha
started up. '
"And. say! He could, you know, he
could play the bugle. I thought as I heard
him that if I could close out my business
there I'd start a suburb of my own some
where and give, to sell the lots, moon
light excursions only and have him, aa
early settler there, blowing the bugle on
excursion nights, as the people strolled,
about before the sale.
"He played 'Oft in the Stilly Night.' and
the 'Last Rose of Summer" in the most
beautiful fashion and I thought he"d for
gotten the contract, but the next minute
I thought he must have blown a hola
through one of the bends of the instru
ment and that the wind was escaping
there, because of all the unearthly bugit*
notes I ever heard that certainly was tnu
most awful.
"My friend on the veranda was mani
festly pleased, and my friend with the
cornet did not disappoint him. Of all the
bad playing I ever heard, this was easily
the worst. â¢
" 'Hra-m,' my friend on the veranda
continued, sort of musing like, as my
friend up the hill went on. 'Is that figure
you named the best you can do?'
" The very best,' I says.
" 'Well,' he says. Til come and sign
the lease In the morning.' And he did.
"Ten days later he moved In. That
night he heard no bugle. He wa3 at me
about it the very next day. And I hal
to tell him that the bugler had had an
attack of hay fever the day before, and
the doctor had ab-so-lute-ly forbidden
him to touch a bugle again before winter,
or late in the fall, at the earliest.
"You see you don't hear the bugle in tho
fall and winter at all. when the windows
are shut, and. not expecting to hear it
then, you don't miss It. What I am hop
ing is that by the time .spring comes my
new tenant will have become so pleased
with the place Itself that he'll forget
about the bugle entirely." â Sun.

"It is an Interesting study at this time

salesman in one of the fashionable Chest

great many, of them can't afford to buy
diamondsâ that is, first clas3 diamondsâ
and yet they want something nice. When
they feel that way we always show them
opals; and then you ought to hear them.
'Opals!' they exclaim. 'Why, opals are
unlucky!' Then we have to explain to
them that the old superstition about opals
was exploded years ago. As a matter of
fact, a great many young men In moder
ate circumstances prefer an opal ring to
a diamond. One young man who had an
eye for the beautiful sent a cluster the
other day made up of thirteen opals.
There's defiance of superstition for you!"

in Robes of Dazzling Failure/'
LANSDOWNE TAKES
FOREIGN PORTFOLIO
MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE. WHO HAS TAKEN CHARGE OF THE
â¢ BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE. IT IS GENERALLY PREDICTED THAT
HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVE A FAILURE.
LONDON, Nov. 3.â "Clad in the
robes of dazzling failure," is the
way one Liberal newspaper de
scribes the Marquis of Lans
downe's entry into the Foreign
Office. This undoubtedly expresses the
opinion of a preponderance of the British
public. Irrespective of party lines. Even
among those organs feebly upholding the
advisability of Lord Lansdowne's appoint
ment there Is a tendency to allocate to
him the portion of a mere nominal head
of the Foreign Office, blindly following
out every wish of the Premier. This, the
Associated Press learns. Is quite opposed
to Lord Salisbury's own idea. He does
not share the general belief that In the
War Office Lansdowne did badly. In fact,
the Premier Is so convinced of the reverse
that he gave Lord Lansdowne the option
of continuing in his former office or tak
ing the new billet. Lord Salisbury was
delighted that Lord Lansdowne was wlll-
ing to accept the Foreign Office portfolio.
He believes he will make a strong foreign
secretary and had long contemplated Lord
Lansdowne as his successor, should the
doctors refuse to allow him to continue
the severe duties he undertook during the
last Parliament. One of Lord Salisbury's
closest friends said:
"Lord Lansdowne, by his training and
social career, is more fitted and available
to meet diplomats t.ian decide large Is
sues. Should he fail It will only be be
cause he Is too much of a gentleman."
The Under Secretaryship in the War
Office and Colonial Office, vacant through
the chanpes in the Cabinet, must now be
selected, which Is no easy matter. R. W.
Hanbury, the Financial Secretary of the
Treasury, is believed likely to succeed C.
T. Ritchey as president of the Board of
Trade; and George Wyndham. the Parlia
mentary Secretary of the War Office, Is
frequently mentioned as the successor of
Gerald Balfour as Chief Secretary for
Ireland, though the tetter's resignation Is
by no means certain/at present.

Miss Helen Murphy, a popular society woman of Oshkoeh, WIs., Is an ardent
friend to Peruna. The following Is a letter written by Ml?s Murphy, and gives
her opinion cf Peruna as a preventive as well as cure for catarrh ailments:
The Peruna Medicine Company, Columbus, Ohio:
"We keep a bottle of it on hand all the time and when I have been out
in inclement weather, I take a dose or two of Peruna end it prevents my
taking any cold and keeps me perfectly well." Yours very truly,
HELEN MURPHY.
Gentlemen â "About three months ago I contracted a sevore cold at an
evening reception, which settled on my lungs and threatened to be very
serious. As my mother has used Peruna with good results, she sent for a
bottle for me and I found that it gavs me blessed relief. Before the sec-
ond bottle was consumad I was well. Â¦

HOW A PRETTY SOCIETY GIRL
ESCAPED DREAD CONSUMPTION.
Peruna Used in Time Saved Her Life.
All's Well That Ends Well.
It is the same old story of exposure to
cold. The cold passing down the bron-
chial tubes to the lungs; the developing
of a settled cold on the lungs, coughing,
expectoration. This, Is a short road to
consumption. Thousands of people have
traveled it. Thousands more will travel
it and the coming winter will, develop an
untold multitude of new cases.
In the case of Helen Murphy, the end-
ing was a happy one.- She started on
the road to consumption after catching
cold at a reception. Instead of waiting
until she became incurable, Peruna was
resorted to and her life was saved.
It Is a pity that every one else In this
wide land could not know of this very
effective remedy in such cases. Â¦ The news
Is spreading fast but a great many peo-
ple have not yet heard that Peruna Is a
sure cure in these cases. -
Â¦ Perur.a cures acute catarrh and chronic
catarrh; catarrh of the head and catarrh
of the lungs; catarrh of the throat and
catarrh of the stomach. Wherever ca-
tarrh may have located itself, whether
in the digestive organs, kidneys or pelvic
organs, Peruna is sure , to eradicate the
disease promptly.
Â¦ Another case where consumption was
cheated of its prey occurred in the State
of Iowa. The report of the case created
considerable attention at the time and
was furnished us unsolicited by Mr. Hen-
rickson. In a letter to Dr. Hartman he
sets forth some interesting details of his
rescue from consumption, lie made use
of the following language: Â¦ .
"I have been for years a constant suf-
ferer from chronic catarrh of the head
and throat, which finally worked down
into the air passages. In the spring of
'98 I took a severe cold and coughed all
summer. I thought I had consumption.
Then I had a bad attack of la grippe.
After' taking a course of Peruna I feel
cured of all these troubles.
"Whenever any of our children get sick
we give them Peruna, and it never fails
to cure them. I most heartily testify to
the value of Peruna in cases of catarrh
and la grippe. I hope this may be the
means of others suffering as I did to take
Peruna and be cured. We would not be
without it in the house."
HENRY HENRICKSON.
Generally the first cold of the season is
caught in November. With some people
this lasts all winter and lays the founda-
tion of chronic catarrh. In the beginning
a few doses of Peruna is sufficient to
make a permanent cure.
Send for Dr. Hartman's latest book on
chronic catarrh. Address The Peruna

Only One Pile Cure Which Can Be
Considered Such.
The Pyramid Pile Cure la strictly scien-
tific both in Its composition and in its
therapeutic action, and the best feature is
that it is perfectly harmless. No ill effects
ever result from Its use.
The cure Is accomplished painlessly by
the astringent properties and healing: oils
contained in it, which cause the little
tumors and congested blood vessels to
contract and the obstruction to the cir-
culation to be removed. '
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is In suppository
f,orm and far superior to any salve or
ointment for convenience.
It is applied at night and absorbed into
the sensitive rectal membrane, acting:
both as a local and a constitutional treat-
ment.

I often been effectual, even in cases of many
years' standing:. '

BERLIN, Nov. 3.â The second trial of
the rich banker Sternberg (sentenced last
April to two years' imprisonment for a
crime against morality) this week again
showed incapacity, illegal methods and
traces of corruption in the Berlin crimi
nal police, and the press is vigorously de
manding thorough reform of that body.
During to-day's proceedings the Stern
berg case assumed more sensational fea
tures. The evidence showed' that Crimi

Sternberg 30,000 marks as a mortgage
upon his house and a number of other
loans Also that Privy Councillor Romen
while State's Attorney accepted favors
from Sternberg.

Sternberg was convicted on his first trial,
made a full retraction yesterday charg
ing Officer SU<=Tstackdoter and Criminal
Commissioner von Tresckowthiel with
having, by Intimidation, induced her to
testify falsely.
The handling of the mysterious Konitz

San Luis Obispo County Grand Jury
Finds That the Homicide Was
Justifiable.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Nov. 3.-Simon
Morrillo, who on September 19 shot and

Moreno's attempt to draw a pistol when
Morrillo was approaching him. Morrlllo,

and killed Moreno. Moreno had not only
usurped Morrlllo's place in Mrs. Morrlllo'a

SEATTLE, Nov. 3.â The steamship Sen

day with 333 passengers and $500,000 In
gold. Among the Senator's passengers
was Receiver Alexander McKenzie of the
Nome Gold Mines, under arrest and in
charge of Marshals Shelby Monckton and
George Burnham of San Francisco. As is
already known, he Is in custody for al
leged contempt of an order Issued by the
Circuit Court of Appeals of San Fran
cisco. McKenzie declined positively to
discuss his case. T. J. Geary, his attor
ney, who accompanied him from Nome,
said that the contest would be waged to
a finish before the United States Supreme
Court. â¢
"It is positively untrue," said Geary,
"that McKenzie is short in his accounts.
When Ltndblom stated that there was a
shortage of $40,000 he knew he spoke false
ly. McKenzie had not made a report of
his receivership to Judge Noyes up to
the time of his arrest, but the whole mat
ter will be shown in its true light in the
higher courts. McKenzie is guilty of no
wrong.
McKenzie. accompanied by the Marsh

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. Nov. 3.â Advices have
been received here of the- recent outbreak
of tribal war In the Admiralty group of
the South Sea Islands. The outbreak was
quelled in a bloody fight. In which a land-
Ing party from the German corvette
Moowe defeated the belligerent natives.
The corvette was on a surveying cruise
through the Bismarck archipelago when
word was brought to her commander of a
tribal war on one of the Islands of the Ad
miralty group. In which one section of the
natives had, literally speaking, painted
the /Island red with the blood of their
rivals. It was reported that 150 natives
had been butchered, and with a view of
stopping this bloodshed the corvette was
headed for the island. One side had it all
their own way. being materially assisted
by the rifles looted from the stores of the
island schooner Metze, which had been cut
out by them some months prior to the
outbreak and its officers and crew of sev
en murdered.
The Moowe was dispatched by orders of
the German Governor, Herr von Bonning
sen, whose headquarters are at Herbert
schoeh. It arrived off Tavi, Great Ad
miralty Island, and ran close in to the
village before dawn. Two cutters, each
with a Hotchkiss gun mounted on Its bow,
were quickly lowered and a force of 120
Germans and forty native police, under
four German officers were put ashore. The
entire party, which was under the com
mand of Lieutenant Captain Herring, was
armed with rifles. Â¦
It was intended to surprise the villagers,
but, unfortunately for the success of this
scheme, the cutters ran upon a reef, and
It was broad daylight before they were
extricated and headed for the village. It
was expected that the natives pn catching
sight of the cutters would make oft to the
bush, but In this the Germans miscalcu
lated the daring of the islanders. No soon
er were they in range than a volley of bul
lets whistled around their heads. 4ft was
then seen that the natives had ascended
the trees and from these points of van
tage were using their stolen Winchesters.
Fire was opened by the Hotchkiss guns
with good effect, while the guns of the
Moowe played en the natives from her an
chorage. A landing was effected and the
natives broke and fled, leaving 1 a large
number of their dead behind. Of the at
tacking force but three of the police were
killed, having been struck by spears In
close fighting, ar.d two sailors were
wounded, the aim of the natives not hav
ing been good. The village was then razed
and with a few parting shells the Moowe
steamed away.

PHOENIX. Nov. 3.â Deputy United
States Marshal A. J. Porterie this
morning placed under arrest Mrs. C. M.
Binford, daughter of Judge C. C. Mc-
Cornas of Los Angeles, and E. W. Harris
of that city, who were charged with
maintaining illicit relations. The couplo
arrived here last Monday from Los Angre
les, registering at the Hotel Adams as
C. W. Long and wife.
About a year ago C. M. Binford, then a
clerk in the First National Bank of Los
Angeles, fell in love with Miss McComas.
They ran away and were married, going
to Prescott, Ariz.,. where Binford obtained
employment with "the Bashford-Burmister
Mercantile Company. For some months
their married life ran smoothly, but
amicable relations were finally broken
and the husband sent his wife back to her
Los Angeles home about live months ago
It is said in her defense that since then
he has contributed nothing to her sup
port.
Recently E. W. Harris, who poses be
fore the world as a magnetic healer and
vkho is himself a married man, met the
woman. An attachment sprang up, with
the result that about a week ago they
suddenly left Los Angeles, coming to
gether to Phoenix under assumed names.
The information on which their arrest
was made came from the office of the
United States District Attorney in Pres
cott and probably was given by Binford.
They were placed under $500 bonds to ap
pear for examination on Monday morning,
and pending the supplying of the bonds
they are in the custody of the Sheriff.
They seem to be happy In one another's
society and the woman says she is des
perately in love with Harris. She is an
attractive girl of only 19 years. Harris ia
about 30 years of age.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 3.â Mrs. C. W.
Harris, wife of the runaway "magnetic
healer," is almost prostrated by the news
of her husband's arrest. She was in a
highly nervous condition to-night and dis
played more grief than anger. She said
she would go to Arizona at once if she
could be of any assistance in extricating
her husband from his position, and rather
condones the offense than blames htm.
She had little to say detrimental to Mrs.
Binford, her enly anxiety being for the
safety of the man who has wronged her.
The present elopement is the second one
In which Mrs. Binford has figured. About
one vear ago. after she had married C. M.
Bln/ord without the knowledge or con
sent of her parents, the youthful couple
obtained parental forgiveness. Carroll
McCbmas, a sister of the recreant wife, is
whistling her way to fame, having recent
ly gone East to appear in vaudeville.
Judge McComas. the father, had not
succeeded at a late hour in obtaining the
$500 necessary to telegraph for his daugh
ters release, but hopes to do so In the
morning.

NEW HIGH SCHOOL STRUCTURE OF
LOS BANOS IS OF UNIQUE DESIGN
Spanish Mission Style of Architecture Adopted and Arrange
ment of the Rooms Is Most Convenient.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1900.
V U the Board of Education of Los
I Banos. in Merced County, must
jj be given great credit for erect
u. ing a new high school building
which is an innovation and cer
tainly a decided improvement over other
buildings of this character. Instead of
the old-style red brick building, the con-
tract has been awarded for a building in
the Spanish mission style, the walls being
of brick. The rooms will all be on one
floor and there will be a high basement
for heating and ventilating apparatus,
sanitary work and play rooms.
The study room is in the center of the
building and will have a seating capacity
of 250. This room is light and lofty. The
other portions of the floor are divided into
five recitation rooms and offices, all open
ing into the main large study room, thus
dispensing with passageways and corri
dors.
The building complete will cost $15,000,
and will certainly be a handsome orna
rnont to the town. Louis S. Stone of San
P rancisco is the architect. "

on to cure diseases of the organs of
respiration. It cures obstinate, deep-

says : n There is nothing more that we

There is no alcohol in "Golden Med-

The dealer, tempted by the little more

will sometimes try and sell a substitute
when the J Discovery " is asked for. No
substitute medicine will 6atisfy the sick
like "Golden Medical Discovery." It
always helps. It almost always cures.
Â« Two years ago a severe cough started on roe

Mr. F. Skjod, of Danewood, Chisago Co.. Minn.
"I could not sleep nights, a* the cough was

cines, but to no avail, until a year ago, when I
got so bad I could not breathe through my nose
at times. I thea tried Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-

REWARD OF MERIT.
A New Catarrh. Cure Secures National
Popularity in Less Than One Year.
Throughout a grreat nation of eighty
million it Is a desperate struggle to se-
cure even a recognition for a new article,
to say nothing of achieving popular fa-
vor, and yet within one year Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets, the new catarrh cure, has
met with such buccess that to-day It can
be found in every drug store throughout
the United States and Canada.
To be sure, a large amount of adver-
tising was necessary in the first Instance
to bring the remedy to the attention of
the public, but every one' familiar with
the subject knows that advertising: alone
never made any article permanently suc-
cessful. It must have in addition abso-
lute, undeniable merit, and this the new
catarrh cure certainly possesses In a
marked degree.
Physicians who formerly depended upon
Inhalers, sprays and local washes or oint-
ments now use Stuarts Catarrh Tablets
because, as one of the most prominent
stated, these tablets contain in pleasant
convenient form all the really efficient ca-
tarrh remedies.- such as red gum, Guaacol
Eucalyptol and Sanguinarla.
They contain no. cocaine nor opiate and
are given to little children with entire
safety and benefit.
Dr. J. J. Reitiger,of Covington, Ky
says: "I suffered from catarrh in my head
and throat every fall, with stoppage of
the nose and nritation in the throat af-
fecting my voice and often extending to
the stomach, causing catarrh of the stom-
ach. I bought a fifty-cent package of Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets at my; druggist's
carried them in my pocket and used them
faithfully, and the way in which they
cleared my head and throat was certainly
remarkable. I had no catarrh last winter
and spring, and consider myself entirely
free from any catarrhal trouble." .,
Mrs. Jerome â¢ Kllison of Wheeling, W.
Va., writes: I suffered from catarrh near-
ly my whole life and last winter my two
children also suffered from catarrhal
colds and sore throat so much they were
out of school a, large portion. of the win-
ter. My brother who was cured ' of ca-
tarrhal' deafness by using; Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets vrged me to â¢ try them so
much that I did so, and am truly thank-
ful for Â¦: what they have done for myself
and my children. Â¦ I always keep a box
of the tablets In the house and at the
first appearance Â« of a cold or sore throat
we nip it in :, the bud and catarrh is â¢ no
longer a household affliction â¢ with Â¦ us.' -. -

T7hat to Do.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy fulfills every
wish in curing rheumatism' pain in the
back, kidneys, liver, bladder and every part
of the urinary passage. It corrects inability
to hold water and scalding pain in passing
it, or bad effects following use -'of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-
ordinary effect of Swamp- Root Is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.
If you need a medicine you should have the

Plymouth place and Jackson boulevard.
from which he had Â¦watched to-night's
Democratic parade, and left for his home
1n Lincoln, the Democratic campaign in
Chicago, Cook County, and the State of
Illinois was practically over. For hours
after Mr.' Bryan had gone the cheering
thousands swept down the boulevard, for
it was a great parade â the greatest and
most successful affair of the kind ever
managed by the local Democracy. It Â¦was
intended to be the crowning effort of Mr.
Bryan's followers in Chicago and the
county of Cook, and It proved in realiza
tion all that the most ardent Democrat
could have desired.

were filled with cheering multitudes that
packed the sidewalks and the windows
and found points of vantage upon tops of
street cars and the roofs of buildings. It
would be difficult to tell which cheered
the more, the crowd of marchers or the
crowd of onlookers; but while the parade
was in progress the streets gave forth one
continuous roar of human voices punctu
ated by shrill blasts from tin horns and
tbe crash of music from the bands. All
along the line of march, which was con
fined entirely to the downtown streets,
men had been stationed with unlimited
supplies of red fire and positive instruc
tions to "keep her burning." The orders
were obeyed to- the letter, and the pale
yfllow gleams from the torches of the
marchers were throughout many portions
of the route made insignificant by the
bright crimFon glare from the many fires
along the sidewalk.
Slakes Five Speeches and Reviews
Long Procession at Chicago.
CHICAGO, Nov. 3.â With four addresses
In Chicago and one at Harvey. William
Jennings Bryan to-day practically closed
his long campaigning in the struggle for
the Presidency. To-night. from In front of
the Union League Club, on Jackson boule
vard. Mr. Bryan reviewed, amid a din of
cannon and slare of fireworks, an Im
mense parade of Democrats, which
marked the close of the campaign in Chi
cago, and late to-night he left over the
Burlington road for his home in Lincoln,
where, with his family, he will receive
election returns next Tuesday. To-day,
the third of Mr. Bryan's speech-making
in Chicago, was marked by tremendous
crowds at each of the five meetings ad
dressed by him. and the parade to-riight
developed into one long ovation, the cheer-
Ing for the Democratic Presidential candi
date being almost Incessant from the time
he stepped on the reviewing stand until,
rather weary from his arduous work of
the past three days, he stepped Into* his
carriage and was driven to the. Union sta
tion.
At noon to-day the'Iroquois Club grave a
banquet in hpnor of Mr. Bryan, at which
many of the members who opposed him
In 1836 pledged him support on' next
Tuesday.
At 10 o'clock Mr.' Bryan began. his day's
epeechmaking at a big open-door meeting
In front of the Transit House, Forty-sec
ond and Halstfad streets, . the center of
the stockyards district. Three other meet-
Ings were also addressed by Mr. Â¦ Bryan
during the afternoon. At 2:30 p. m. he
spoke at an open-air meeting at Maxwell
and Union streets. At 4 p. m. he addressed
an open-air meeting on the lake front.
Washington street and Michigan avenue.
From there Mr. Bryan took a suburban
train to Harvey, where he addressed a big
meeting of foundrymen and mill hands.
The final meeting of the day and the last
of Mr. Bryan's remarkable campaign out
side of his own State was at the Calumet
Theater, in South Chicago. From there
Mr. Bryan went at once to the reviewing
stand, on Jackson boulevard,. where for an
hour he.' stood and bowed as the. hosts of

number, of lesser lights of the Democracy.
The greetings extended to the Democratic
candidate by the men in the lino of march
were enthusiastic in the extreme.
The parade was divided into three corps
âthe first corps, which held the right ot
the line, being composed of men from the
west side -of the city, under .the leadership
of Alderman John Powers of the Nine
teenth Ward." -who for this special oc
casion was dubbed Major General Pow
ers, a title assumed also by John S.
Cooper, who commanded the second corpn,
men from the north side, and M. C. Mc-
Donald, who led the third corps- ' the
voters from the outside. The three corps
were given precedence in the line of
march according to the number of men
they were able to bring into line, and as
the west side Is as large as both the north
and south sides combined the corps of
Major General Powers easily secured tbe
post of honor. Directly behind the com
mander of the first corps came a band
of sixty pieces and then the Cook County
Marching Club, an organization that al
ways presents a magnificent appearance.
It was given the first round of cheers,
and from its first appearance until the
rear of the third corps had passed thu
cheering was without cessation.
There were Bryan clubs, Bryan league.-,
Alschuler clubs and leagues and Bryan
and Alschuler clubs and leagues seem
ingly without limit. The great strength
of the parade lay, however, in the ward
clubs, which turned out with overflowing
ranks. Even in the command of General
McDonald, whose men came chiefly from
wards which In all â¢ elections are hope
lessly Republican, the members of the
ward clubs were present In full force.
Great numbers of transparencies were
carried, many of the sentiments evoking
much laughter and applause. i . . .

RECENT CASUALTIES
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 3.-Carl
Martens Is dead. .The man who
-a few years ago was one of the
best-known Orchestra leaders in
the" United States, whose name
was on every tongue in musical circles
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, passed
away early this morning alone in his room
in a lodging-house at 242Vi South Broad
way. His' death was due to quick con
sumption, aggravated by dissipation. He
had no relatives In this country but his
wife, from whom he had separated. Shu
is said to be In San Francisco. He was
only 3S years of age.
Martens was a native of Hesse Darm
stadt. He studied In the conservatories
at Leipslff and Brussels, and at the con
clusion of his course came to the United
States. He was'a tine performer on the
cello and piano, but his specialty was or
cnestra leadership, and he at once took
a place in the front rank as a musician.
He was leader for Emma Abbott for sev
eral Reasons,", besides being a symphony
leader â¢ in . New York. He came to this
coast as leader for the Tavary company.
Martens hy late year3 became addicted to
drink artd finally lost caste among the
musicians. Several .months agfo'he came
to Los Angeles, and for a time was leader
of- the orchestra at the Imperial Cafo.
His health continued to decline and as he
was apparently unable to control his ap
petite for liquor, he- lost his position and
went to Arizona. . -;
- Last Sunday Martens again appeared in
Los Angeles. ; He was a physical wreck,
broken down and penniless. The Imperial
management told him he could have his
board, while the members of the orchestra
rented a room for him, where they could
look after him. During last night lodgers
Carl Martens came to the Pacific Coast
with the Tavary Opera Company as con
ductor for that organization and wielded
tne baton during the season of three
weeks in February. 1836. In that position
ho, attracted the attention of the manage
ment of the TIvoll Opera-house and vai
offered an engagement, which he accept
ed, dating from February 22, and which
continued for some time thereafter. He
had previously been connected with the
management of the Emma Abbott Opera
Company and had toured the country from
end to end as conductor. At the Tivoll
Opera-house he succeeded Adolph Bauer.
Upon leavlnp the Tavary company he was
Kiven as a testimonial by his old musical
associates a baton of ebony, on which, was
inscribed a mention of the last season
with that company. He was also banquet
ed by the >Tavary orchestra and received
many flattery marks of attention.

WHO TASSED AWAY UNATTENDED BY FRIENDS IN HIS ROOM.
IN A LODGING-HOUSE AT LOS ANGELES.
Both the Policy 'Board and the Board of
Construction, however; have gone on the
theory that it is wise to take advantage
of the existir.R sentiment of th? country
in favor of a larger navy- and they have
besides. in their view large programmer
adopted Â¦ by Germany and other nations.
There is no desire on the part of any offi
cer to emulate the 'example of Kafsef Wil

navy should be established which will
place enough ships at the disposal of the
United States not only to protect the At
lantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts but outly
ing American possessions.
This programme Is not so comprehen
sive R3 that formulated by the Board of
Construction of the Navy Department,
which also considered the programmes of
foreign nations, especially Germany. Sec
retary Long has called on officers not at
tached to any' of the boards for their
views as to the programme to be submit
ted to .Congress, and when he returns to
Washington will determine what meas
ures he will recommend.
Before the Secretary left the city an Im
pression gained ground that his recom
mendation would be confined to gunboats.
Eleven armor clads and three protected
cruisers, authorized during the last and
preceding sessions, have yet to be con
tracted for. and the Secretary fears the
shipbuilding yards will not be able to ac
commodate any additional vessels of great
displacement.

Nothing Is So Safe and Pleasant
as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Thousands of men and women have
found Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the Bar-
est and most reliable preparation for any
form of indigestion or stomach trouble.
, Thousands of people who are not sick,
but are well and wish to keep well, take.
Stuart's Tablets after every meal to In-
sure perfect digestion and avoid trouble.
But it is not. generally known that the
Tablets are just as good and wholesome
for little folks* as for their elders. . '.
Little children who are pale, thin and
have no appetite, or do not grow or
thrive, should use the tablets after eat-
ing and -will derive 'great benefit from
them.
Mrs. G. H. Crotsley, 533 Washington
street, Hoboken,. New Jersey, writes:
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Just fill the
bill for children as well as for older
folks. I've had the best of luck with
them. My three-year-old girl takes them
as readily as candy. * I have only to say
"tablets" and she drops everything . else
and runs for them.
A Buffalo mother a short time ago, who
I despaired of the life of her babe, was so
delighted with the results from giving
the child these. tablets that sho went be-
fore the notary public of Erie County, N.
Y.. and made the following affidavit: . .
CJentlemen: : Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
were recommended to me for my- two
months' old baby, which was sick and
puny and the doctors said was suffer-
ing from indigestion. I took the child to
the hospital, but there found no relief. A
friend mentioned the Stuart Tablets and
I procured .a box from my druggist ana
used only the large sweet lozenges In
the box and' was delighted to find they
were just the thing for my baby. . I feel

Gold to Paris.
LONDON. Nov. 3.â The Statist says that
the short supply and continued outflow of
gold induced the market to adopt a cau
tious attitude at the beginning of the
week, but no appreciable gold exports and
a better supply of money caused bills to
be taken freely since Tuesday. The prob
abilities are that the Bank of England
will be compelled to take further Imeas
ures to protect the reserves.
French bankers think London will have
to Bend mere gold to Paris in consequence
of the larjre pums due France. Money is
still wanted for New York and the indi
cations are London will have to ship more
there.

concerned. Many Spanish soldiers who
formerly served in Cuba and the Philip
pines are among the revolters, who also
nave a number of strikers in their ranks.
Poverty, it is believed, is the true cau^o
of the outbreak."

As to what is transpiring in Spain I
only know what the papers say. But I
can say that Spain is thoroughly Carlist.
Deep discontent reigns throughout the
country against the Government. This
discontent is justilied, especially by ths

outbreak is encouraged by Don Carlos or
else he would have issued a proclamation.
Had he taken the initiative armies would
have been raised where oniy bands arc

Such a. fellow has the same place in politics that the Chinese stinkpot has in war. After this election
is over and Brvan is beaten, he will be found declaring defeat' was due to his party's abandonment of the
Democratic principle of expansion. ' . \
The only serious result that can follow his incendiary advice will be getting an occasional fool into
trouble by attempts to steal ballot-boxes or murder election judges. T That apostle of purity in politics. Mr.
Dick Croker. has advised violence also. But what right has either to talk about the sacredness of the frani
chise? In States ruled by the party of Bryan a free ballot is unknown.. If the franchise were free:;Mc-
Kinley would carry Mississippi,, Alabama and the twoCarolinas. When the majorities in those States sought
expression at the ballot Hearst's beloved "apostle of liberty. Senator Tillrnan," said in '[the United States Sen

Nice people these' to do the flamboyant act in favor of a free ballot and a fair count!
He declared that Democrats had voted the Republican ticket in order to give victory to the Demo
cratic principle of expansion, and that the people had "repudiated the Democratic party and its leadership."
All this and much more this fellow said in approval 'of the result of the, elections in 1898. Now he issues "a
feculent proclamation declaring that the same States will have to-be bought to indorse the administration
which he then declared deserved indorsement! - :
.On November 10, i8g3, after every one of those States had gone Republican, this Hearst, over his own
signature, said in the Examiner: "The vote of this election is a vote of approval for the war and the prin
ciple of expansion, and for the greater conservatism of the Republican party. It is both right and reason
able that the administration which carried this glorious war to a successful conclusion should receive a vote
of confidence. It is both right and reasonable that the Â¦policy of expansion, ever the policy of the Ameri
can people since Jefferson annexed the Louisianas. should receive the approval of the American people Re
publican and Democratic."
Two years ago those States all gave large Republican majorities. .Were they bought then? If not
what reason has any decent man for saying that they will have to be bought now? The issues are the same'
There is no change in the political situation. . â ~
The special, idiotic infamy of this Hearst is illuminated by quoting him against him
self. On November 12, 1898, less than two years ago, this defamer of the President said
in his Examiner, the same journalistic cuspidor which now slops over with his drool:
"The powers, even if united, would have their hands full if they tackled\this aroused
country, and they would know very well that they had been in a fight before they got
through with their job of coercion. , But with England our friend, we can laugh at the
fulminations of all the other powers and go right ahead settling our little war with
Spain in our own sweet way. And that is just what we propose to do. We have made
up our minds to take the Philippines, and we are going to take them, paying a fair price
and wronging nobody. BUT JUST LET ANY OF THOSE POWERS TRY' TO STOP US
WHEN WE ARE CARRYING HOME THE BUNDLE and we'll show the world one more
example of a power getting thumped and mauled and thrown into the gutter SO GO
RIGHT AHEAD, PRESIDENT M'KINLEY. DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU A BIT THE
ELECTIONS ARE OVER, THE COUNTRY IS BEHIND YOU and the people are really spoiling
for a little more diversion before their blood cools. Tell the powers to mind their own business or you'll
teach them how to do it." Â¦
This creature says now that the Republicans will buy the election in Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Il
linois, Kentucky. New York, Maryland, Michigan and California.
The whole thing would be laughable were it not infamous. He charges that the
President of the United States has sold his official action for "a substantial considera
tion." The craven creature who makes such a charge should be treated seriously
enough to be kicked out of the company of decent American citizens. In the counts of
his indictment of the President he charges him with assuming "the right to govern ter
ritory of t!ie United States without reference to the constitution.'/ Softly there, young
man! That is an admission that the Philippines are the territory; of the United Slates and
that Bryan intends to give away such territory if he is elected. Which is the more
heinous offense â governing territory of the United States outside the constitution, as
Jefferson governed Louisiana, or giving such territory away?

WR. HEARST; president of the National Association of Bryan Clubs, has
â¢ kindly taken charge of the destinies of the republic and has issued a screech that
is a fine example of several things which decent men execrate and avoid. In
its style this production is suggestive of that unnatural malady known as "he-hyster
ics." He sees the republic "tottering" and is 'trying to keep it on its feet. As he thinks
in dollars and cents and by heredity knows no influence but money in politics, before
his red eye rises a specter of millions given "by the trusts and their confederates" to buy
the election! Therefore he orders out the guards and instructs the members of his clubs
to resist with violence the declaration of any poll where the result is not agreeable to
him. That his opinion may be taken, he desires telegrams sent to him in order that he
may direct the proper number of votes to be counted.
HEARST, HIS SCREECH.
The Legislature of this winter will have to appor
tion the State into Congressional, Senatorial and As
sembly districts under the new census. The
railroad and the bosses of both parties desire
to make that apportionment to suit them
selves. It is mainly for that reason the railroad
has so actively interfered in politics this year. The
menace is serious enough to arouse everj' thoughtful
citizen. The change in the management of the rail
road gives promise that it will soon be taken out of
politics. Therefore if it be beaten this time we shall
probably be rid altogether of its corrupting influence
in our political affairs. Let every voter resolve to
down the boodlers. Let us have an honest Legisla
ture.
During the campaign the bosses and the railroad
touts have been busy trying to induce decent Repub
licans. to vote for such men as Dibble and Woife, by
pretending that their election is necessary to give Re
publicans control of the Legislature. Such argu
ments are worthless. They are weak with the weak
ness of a double defect. In the first place there is no
danger that the Republican majority in either the
Senate or the Assembly will be dependent upon the
election of these crooked ones. In -the second place,
these tools of the bosses cannot be counted on to up
hold Republicanism: They are in politics for the
spoils and will vote as the spoilsmen of the bosses
and the railroad dictate.
OUT of this campaign California ought to
emerge with an honest Legislature. Not a sin
gle man known to be a "crooked politician"
should be elected, no matter upon what ticket he runs.
Corr.parativelj- few such men have been nominated on
the Republican side, but in this city the ward bosses,
backed by the managers of the Southern Pacific cor
poration, succeeded in getting control of the Repub
lican primaries in some districts and were thus enabled
to force the nomination of their tools. Fortunately
these men are few and are well known. It will be no
difficult task to pick them out for defeat, and it is tho
<Jut3' of the voters, regardless of party, to defeat them.
AN hJONEST LEGISLATURE.
Tou would like to know what hast be
come of the city editor who set me that
task? I may not conceal the dreadful
truthâ he has since become an actor.
The actors should know best whether
their standard of acting is rising or not.
I am sure the standard for criticism is
though slowly. For proof: X can distinct
ly remember than in my 'prentice days I
was once instructed by a city editor to do
the South Metropolitan Police Station, a
Daly play and the Moreue. all In the same
evening. Such a detail was nothing un
usual then; to-day, I think, ft wouli be
rare.
I have delineated appear to other eyes a-*

This Is a little incoherent, but I suppose
that by the "murderers" Mr. ManafieM
means his old enemies, the critics. Too
strong, my Richard and my King: had
you said, now, "manslaughterers" 1 contd
cheerfully have agreed with you. For the
number of critics vrho x sre anrl willfuMv
lie is, I believe, very small. Most of them
simply don't Fee. because they have n>
more been trained to see than has the
average actor been trained to act. Wher.,
therefore, they are confronted with supe
rior acting, such ns Mr. Mansfield's, they
are incompetent even to report correctlv
what he giver, them, much less to criti
cize it. They kill or attempt to kill hi-,
reputation, not from willfulness, but
from ignorance. But this. Â«j I said at tin*
outset, is not murder, but munÂ«lau.(;htor.
The remedy? A School for Critics. I
cannot deny that this la as necessary as
Is a School for Actors.
He denies the Diderot paradox that the
more the actor seems to feel his part the
less he must really feel it. "I suffer every
night," he says, "all that Richard suf
fered, and so I AM Richard the King
when I PLAY Richard the King."
After he has created a part the question
often arises in Mr. Mansfield's mind:
"Have the people felt and seen the picture
I have painted? Do they see and feel what
I feel? It must be that they do not. for I
read reports which are in direct contradic
tion to what I thought and desired to ac
complish. And so I fail. That is terrible:
to have painted a picture where the angels
Mr. Mansfield has a curious article on
"Audiences" in a recent number of Col
lier's Weekly. Judging from his appar
ent self-possession on the stage no ono
would Imagine that he troubled his head,
much less. his heart, about what was be
ing thought and done on the other side
of the footlights. Yet. according to thlj
sejf-revelation, the auaience 13 projected
in his consciousness as "a black mass, a
monster outside there on the other side
of my little world. It seems to me to be
waiting there to devour me. I suppose
some day it will kill me because I shall
have nothing more to give it. That mon
ster waiting there every night has to bo
fed. Sometimes I think it is insatiable.
I give and I give and I give, and it sin
there intent, waitins for more."
The play should be announced as by
Augustus Thomas and Dr. Oliver Gold
smith or there should be a line on every
programme wherein Goldsmith is allowed
at least the honor of collaboration In the
third act. Mr. Thomas* second act is so
good that he need not fear his glory will
thereby suffer detraction. â. . >
That Mr. Thomas should have acknowl
edged all this by merely a verbal (?)
statement at the Initial ' performance
seems to me very lnauequate. Probably
not less than two hundred and fifty thou
sand people will have i;een tne play when
it closes its run. How are the two hun

not at the initial performance to know
that for the most striking characters,

Meantime the Wells-Fargo wagon will go on as usual and the people will go on pay
ing Wells-Fargo's taxes, while Mr. Valentine keeps his contempt for the paltry dollar
exclusively for political purposes.
But we have no doubt that when Spitzer barks his shins against a pedigree that was
planted in 1640 he will be sorry that he spoke. Hereafter let all such be careful and in
quire who had the honor to be born in the same State as Valentine before they refuse
their express packages to his company and buy and lick their own stamps.
However, Mr. Spitzer may ''call" Mr. Valentine's pedigree and show. one^hat reaches
back to the patriarchs, and then Mr. Valentine will have to lay down his raw and recent
1640 article and fall back on Lincoln, Birney and Cassius M. Clay. This will send Spitzer
to the cyclopedia of biography to see who was born on his native soil, and he may raise
Valentine out of the game entirely. . \
Anyway, whatever his motive, he rises and defies Spitzer. remarking in his letter that
no one has a right to threaten him because, as he puts it in a fine pedigree style: "My
ancestors came to Virginia in 1640; there were born in my native State of Kentucky
three illustrious apostles of libertyâ James G. Birney, Cassius M. Clay and Abraham Lin
coln, and these men taught that the rights of man are of more importance than the
paltry consideration of the dollar." This makes one regret that Mr. Valentine did not
begin paltry dollaring sooner in the campaign and pay his taxes and not compel their pay
ment by the people. v . â¢ â¢ ' " Â¦ - Â¦
We know that Mr. valentine is a busy man, and has long been occupied in making
YVeUs-Fargo's customers pay a war tax that Congress intended should be paid by the
corporation. He is a benevolent man and desires that his customers should support the
Government.
Can it be possible that his motive in waiting so long was to offer himself as a roor
back at the end of a campaign?
, Was properly forwarded." Does that mean promptly forwarded, or is it possible
that Mr. Harden carried this incendiary document on his person until late in October?
Or was Mr. Valentine engaged with scissor* and mucilage in the composition of another
pamphlet and taking a fall out of the human race by circulating it, so that he got ready
to punch Spitzer with a letter only after he had been blighted by intimidation for the
space of two months and ten davs? . .. V.v â¢
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. ist. iqoo.
Mr. Ceilan M. Soitzer.of Messrs. Spitzer & Co., Brokers. 21 Nassau st., New York, and Toledo. Ohio:
My Dear 3ir:â Your letter of August 22nd, 1900, addressed to Mr. C. M. Haydcn, agent Wells. Fanzo &
Co.'s Express. Toledo, was properly forwarded to me. and to explain what follows, is reproduced here ver
batim ct literatim:
The intimidator, Spitzer, did not persecute Mr. Valentine in the first instance. He
administered the by proxy to Mr. Hayden. a humble and we hope faithful agent
of Wells-Fargo. at the mouth of the Maumee River in Ohio, in the town of Toledo.
The 22d of last August this frightfuf Spitzer wrote Mr. Hayden that he objected to Val
entine's support of Brvan to the extent of withdrawing his patronage from Wells-Fargo
and paying war taxes on his packages to some other express company. This appears .to
have been a personal letter to the inoffensive, Hayden. Two nionths and ten days later
Mr. Valentine mustered courage to beard Spitzer in his den. His letter printed in the
Examiner, with his intimidated picture, exposes dates iii its first sentence, which reads:
. An examination of the correspondence and the dates does great credit to Mr. Val
entine's nerve and shows that it takes a long time to scare him, but when he is frightened
he is frightened all over. &
A CRISIS, has arrived. Goddess of Liberty wobbles on the dome of the Capitol,
and her sister,, the well-beloved Goddess of Justice, hovering- over several courthouses,
has torn the bandage off her eyes to hide her indignant blushes. The lesser -lum
inaries of Olympus and other places are all torn Up, and even Boreas holds his breath in
appalled surprise. John J. Valentine has been intimidated by a man of the plebeian name
of Spitzer, who has threatened to divert his express packages to a rival company, or carry
them himself, to the injury of Mr. Valentine's Wells-Fargo octopus, unless the "gentleman
resigns either as president or politician. Mr. Valentine is alarmed to the extent of a two
column letter, and is hiding under Mr. Hearst's printing press.
? â¢ ?
Mr. Stuart Robson has been kind enough
to write the following lines:
"Since you want me to say something
in respect to the liberties taken by Mr.
Thomas in the construction of the third
act of 'Goldsmith,' I may mention that
the act is entirely original, with the ex
ception of several lines spoken by the two
bailiffs, said characters being taken from
'The Good Natured Man.' These two
worthier, were undoubtedly suggested to
the poet by Shakespeare's Dogberry and
Verges In 'Much Ado About Nothing,' sÂ«>
that Mr. Thomas would appear to have as
much claim to their use as 'Qoldsmith.'
In the initial performance of our play, Mr.
Thomas acknowledged his indebtedness" to
tne lesser dramatistâ an admission In
which 1 think he was wrong, as the credit
was really due to tne immortal master
himself."
I am sorry that I cannot agree with Mr.
Robson's conception of what constitutes
an "entirely original" act. The re
semblance? between the third act of
"Oliver Goldsmith" and the third act of
"The Good Natured Man" go much fur
ther, I think, than is suggested above.
The character of Thomas' Goldsmith is
identical with that of Honeywoodâ an
eany. careless, good-natured fellow, no
body's enemy but his own. Mary Horneck
is Identical with Miss Rlchman, the beau
tiful, clever young lady who is in love
with Honeywood. Honeywood loves Miss
Rlchman and is too diffident to confess It,
so she has to make love to him: Gold
r.mtth and Mary Horneck ...re placed in
exactly tho same situation. Honeywood
is arrested for debt, palms off on Miss
â¢ â¢ â¢
Among the many clever touches in
Augustus Thomas' "Oliver Goldsmith,"
few are more clever than the way in
which is Introduced the little love affair
between Garrlck and Katherlne Horneck.
Vet this is a case where ignorance is in
deed bliss, for Garrick's real love affair,
though not less happy, was far different
from the one set forth in the play. In
the year 174t> there came to England from
Vienna a pretty little dancer named Vie
gel, better known by her stage name of
Violette. She brought letters to Lord and
Lady Burlington, who secured her an en
gagement at Drury Lane.' where she be
came a favorite. Garrick fell in love with
her, but his suit was frowned upon by
I^ad'y Burlington, who wished the young
lady to marry a nobleman. Garrick per
severed and after much opposition suc
ceeded â¢ in obtaining Lady Burlington's
consent to his marriage, which took place
en the 22d of June, 1749â somo twenty-four
years before the time at which Mr.
Thomas represents him as being in love
with Katherlne Horneck:
La Violette not only made Garrick's
home happy, but was also of great service
to him in*, tho conducting of his theater.
She lived until after the battle of Water
loo and was a sharp critic of younger
actors who attempted Garrick's parts.
After seeing Kean in "Abel Drugger," she
wrote to him: "Dear Sir: You cannot act
Abel Drugger." To which he replied:
"Dear Madame: I know I cannot."

With his undoubted gold Mr. Shaw has
mingled much undoubted clay. True, tho
dramatic element is just as distinct in
this early work as in his latest play, but
in this as in that the situations 'often tend
to degenerate from the really dramatic to
the purely farcical. One could make an
entertaining play out of "An Unsocial
Socialist," but like "You Never Can Tell,"
it would lack, unity of impression ; it would
be a mixture of comedy, farce and ex
travaganza. And there is a worse fauit
in the book than this; the hero, with aÂ»".
his cleverness, isâ like Valentine in "i'ou
Never Can Tell" and like Charteris in
'â¢The Philanderer" â an unmitigated cad.
NOW thatGeorgeBernard Shaw's
plays and criticisms have made
him well known he Is begin
ning to suffer the penalties of
distinction. Publishers are
bringing 1 out in attractive form the novels
ho wrote during his 'prentice daysâ those
novels which brought him then nothing
more "than an cneournslne; compliment or
two from the most dignified of the Lon
don and" American publishers, who unani
mously declined to venture their capital
upon, me." Small wonder, for Mr. Shaw
is a Socialist of the Socialists. The eco
nomic principles v.hich he sets .forth so
brilliantly in chapter five of "An Unsocial
Socialist" are five hundred yearsâ perhaps
nearer a thousandâ ahead of the time: tc
the average publisher of to-day they must
seem distorted, chimerical, ruinous. One
might wonder, then, at the temerity of the
Messrs. Brentano in extending over Mr.
Shaw the aegis of their name did one not
believe that they realize the extreme tar
diness With which, new ideas Infiltrate
downward, and still the greater tardiness
with which these ideas get themselves em

The gross faults which have marked the recent work
of the local Civil Service Commission have been ex
cused on the ground of ignorance. His Highness the
Mayor is evidently not yet ready to admit the un
comfortable fact that ignorance in public affairs is as
reprehensible as crime.
When officers of the State, holding confidential
and responsible positions in the government of Cali
fornia, pawn themselves to racetrack gamblers ani
pool-sellers there is reason for the suspicion that the
creditors will exact concessions which will not con
tribute to the public welfare.
But the Examiner boycotts Judge Daingerfield be
cause he decided a case against the owner of that
paper. If boycotting a corporati&i is persecution
and threatens to destroy the firm foundations of the
republic, what is boycotting a Judge for deciding that
the law is the law?
THE Examiner i"s excited to the extent of pictures
and two columns of type in several sizes, mostly
large, because a business firm East has foolishly
proposed a boycott of Wells- Fargo because the presi
dent of that corporation supports Bryan and financial

The sentiment of the community must
be in sympathy with the object of the
prominent lawyers who have taken upon
themselves to answer the nameless circu
lar, which is understood to be issued at
the expenre of a millionaire litigant who
was defeated In Judge Daingerfield's
court, but the nobility of American citi
zenship and the manhood of San Francis
co is too great to suppose that the people
will tolerate the attempted assassination
of an honest Judge by unknown and con
cealed foes. The sense of honor charac
teristic of the American citizen insures to
the anonymous circular an opposite from
the intended effect.
San Francisco voters are Independent
and manly people and their sense of fair
play ls strong, and they cannot think that
attacks made by people afraid to sign
their names are fair, honest or designed
for other than a bad purpose. The con
science of the American people revolts at
the Idea of -an anonymous attack on any
person, official or private. Assaults by
persons afraid to give their names or to
father their work are* always repudiated.
The unsigned attack coming from -no
where carries with It the presumption of
untruthfulness and dishonesty, as well as
the proof of cowardice. A statement made
by anybody ashamed to sign it must be
taken as untrue and designed for evil. No
honest man fears the light or ls afraid of
his own name. - ' .Â»,
These documents purport to quote the
utterances of Judge Dalngerfleld and to
recite hla actions as Judge.
To offset these anonymous publications
leading lawyers of the city, regardless of
politics, have issued a signed statement
giving facts, which statement is being ex
tensively distributed. The statement of
these leading attorneys is sufficient evi
dence that no otrier defense of a man like
Judge Daingerfleld. who has twice been
elected a Judge of this city by large ma
jorities and whose official and private con
duct has even been above reproach, is
necessary against an anonymous attack
of this character.
The intelligence and enlightenment of
the citizens of San Francisco is too high
to suppose that an anonymous circular at
tacking an honest Judge can have any
other effect with a decent man than to
condemn its sender, proclaim him a cow
ard and defeat its purpose.
The lawyers ot San Francisco have been
much surprised during the week to receive
through the malls an anonymous circular
attacking Judge William R. Dalngerfleld.
Inquiry has ascertained that the same cir
culars, bearing no signature and purport
ing to emanate from nowhere, have been
scattered broadcast through the city.

the First Infantry Regiment
of the National Guard.
Inspections will occupy the attention of
the National Guardsmen of the Second
Brigade for some time to come. These
will commence to-morrow, and the ques
tion that is asked by those who are posted
as to previous inspections is "Are there to
be bona fide Inspections or are they to be
simply a snow ot men, many of whom
may be 'stutters' placed in the ranks to
bring the company up to the standard?"
They are anxious to know if Major Margo.
the brigade. inspector, will ask each com
pany commanaer upon honor if each man
in the ranks at muster is a bona nde en
listed member of the company. It is
claimed that if that course is pursued no
captain will dare to vouch for men he
does not know, helng aware of what pen
alties are provided. It is claimed that if
this procedure is adopted the exact nu
merical strength of each organization la
the brigade will be ascertained and that
there will be an actual and not a paper
muster.
Lieutenant Colonel O'Nell will assume
command of the First Infantry Regiment
as soon as his commission is delivered to
him. In his capacity as colonel he will
have no easy task in reconciling the mi
nority to the majority and receiving the
hearty co-operation ot all the line officers,
for it is asserted that notwithstanding
the promise he made not to disturb the
comoanlea of the Ellis-stieet Armory
there is not in that armory that feeling
which ought to exist for the good of the
service between the commanding officer
and those under him. The four companies
In the Ellis-street Armory do not feel
happy in the fact that the field officers
were selected from material outside of
their armory. Whether Colonel O'Neil
will be able to win the sixteen officers
from Ellis street over to him time alone
will tell. He will also have to arouse a
spirit of enthusiasm among the officers to
the end that they will enlist young men
into the companies and bring the regiment
up to within 15 or 20 per cent of the max
imum strength, and to do this he will have
.to use all the policy at his command.

The case of Mrs. Helen Saunders, the
wealthy widow of San Rafael, who is ac
cused of defrauding Mrs. Lizzie Kearns.
1409 Leavenworth street, out of $10 for
board and lodging for herself and daugh
ter, was called In Judge Conlan's court
again yesterday morning. Many ladles
were In the courtroom expecting some In
teresting developments, but they were dls
appointedÂ«
Attorney Hawklna for the defendant
arose when the case was called and asked
for a continuance until next Thursday, as
the witnesses who had been subpenaed to
testifyâ to the defendant's character were
mostly engaged in the political campaign
and could not be present. The prosecution
offered no objection and a continuance
was granted until next Thursday.
Meantime the prosecution is busy hunt
ing up landladies â¢whom the defendant and
her daughter have defrauded. There wero
several of them in the courtroom who ex
pressed their willingness to testify against
the defendant, whom they had recognized,
although she bore another name while
boarding with them.
One of them. Miss Bessie Still. %i Geary
street, swore to a complaint before Judge
Conlan charging Mrs. Saunders with de
frauding her out of $10 due for board and
lodging for herself and daughter. They
went to her house on July 27, the day
after leaving Mrs. Kearns' house. Mrs.
Saunders gave the name of Mrs. Ander
son and introduced her daughter as Miss
Anderson. She told a sad story about her
dead husband and said she carried with
her one of his fingers, which she had pre
served In alcohol.
Mother and daughter remained for a
week and suddenly disappeared. It was
supposed, because a. young lady had rec
ognized them at table. They forsot to
liquidate their board bill. Miss Saunders
did not offer to teach Miss Still elocu
tion and the delsarte movements for a
reduction of the board bill.
Another lady, who lives at S2S Powell
street, called at police headquarters and
expressed her readiness to swear to a
warrant for Mrs. Saunders' arrest for de
frauding her. She said Mrs. Saunders was
then known a;? Mrs. Wetmore and her
daughter as Miss Wetmore. Judge Conlan
had taken his departure, and she promised
to be on hand to-morrow morning to
swear to the complaint.

PHILLIPPI. "W. Va., Nov. 3.â Thirteen

along the main I channel and about the
opening were the arms, legs, hands and
othor portions of the bodies of the dead
miners. The miners insist that the ex
plosion was caused by. fire damp.
As the work of removing the dead pro
gresses things look worse. Four men
have been brought out during the last
hour and the searchers report that dozens
are yet in the mine. Most of those
brought out are mutilated beyond descrip
tion.
A messenger Just reutrned from tho
mines states that the bodies of twelve
men have been brought out, eight of
whom were recognized. Four men are in
the hospital and not expected to live until
morning. Twenty men are unaccounted
for. The men are mostly negroes and

cars were blown- forty feet from the track.
One man was blown in two at the loins
and his body thrown against a pile' of
lumber at the mouth of the mine.
The night shift went on duty at 7
o'clock. Everything went smoothly until
about midnight, when the explosion oc
curred. The dead were mutilated beyond
recognition.
The explosion was probably the result
of an accidental discharge of dynamite,
caused perhaps by concussion of a blast.
The property loss Is llKht. Operation will
be resumed at the mines as usual on Mon
day.
The force of the explosion 1 was so great
that two men were found sixty feet from
the mouth of the mine. An hour after the
explosion hundreds had visited the mine.

MANY WORKMEN PERISH IN
A WEST VIRGINIA MINE
THERE was a sad ending yester
day morning to the pleasure
trip of the Leonardo family of
Sunol, two of its members, lit
tle Joe Leonardo, aged 13 years,
and Joe Marshall, aged 19 years, being
found dead in bed, asphyxiated, in the
New Orleans lodging house at 1237 Stock
ton street.
The boys came down from Sunol on Fri
day morning with Mr. and Mrs. A. M.
Leonardo. Joe Marshall was a brother of
Mrs. Leonardo, and little Joe, who was a
bright boy of gentle manners, was her
sen by a former husband. They were on
a visit to Mr. Leonardo's married
daughter. Mrs. J. Silva of 33S Green
street. With the party were three
younger sisters of little Joe. They all
went to the Chutes on Friday night, and
there not being sufficient spare beds in
the Silva household to accommodate all.
It was nearly 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing when they returned from the Chutes,
and the boys were shown to their room
by G. Cllscagne. the landlord. According
to his testimony given at the inquest yes
terday forenoon, he lighted the gas jet
for them and Instructed them as to the
manner In which they should extinguish
it. Following his usual custom, he shut
off the gas supply at the meter at C:30
o'clock in the morning. At 8 o'clock he
detected the odor of the illuminating gas
coming from the room where the deaths
occurred and opening a window overlook
ing the fire escape saw the two boys In
bed, the elder's head and shoulders hang
ing down and almost touching the floor.
The pas key was turned fully on. Neither
of *the boys had had any experience with
gas. Both bodies were rigid, showing that
death had come several hours before the
discovery of the remains.
the two Joes, uncle and nephew, took a
room on the fourth floor of the New Or
leans House.
In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. Leon
ardo and Mrs. Sllva waited for the boys
to come to breakfast. As the hours
passed away they concluded that the boys
had lost their way or been taken, sick,
and they proceeded toward the lodging
house. When they came within a block
of the place they saw the Morgue wagon
standing in front of the door and a black
coffin being placed In it. At the same
time an acquaintance met them and ab
ruptly told the unsuspecting mother that
her brother and her son were dead.
The poor woman collapsed on the side
walk, and on being raised to her feet went
into hysterics, moaning and calling
plteously for her boy Joe. Her three lit
tle girls were screaming with fright and
a crowd of several hundred people gath
ered while Deputy Coroner Flynn and a
policeman were waiting for a bupgy to
take the frantic woman to the Sylva resi
dence.
A verdict of accidental death was ren
dered.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.-Tbe report of
the auditor of the Postoffice Department
for the fiscal year ending, June 30, 1900,
shows that the total revenues for the de â¢
partment for that period were $102,354,5?J
and the expenditures $1OT,249,29S, leaving a
deficit of $4,894,718. Â£
The amount of stamps, stamped envel
opes, newspaper wrappers and postal
cards sold during the year was $94,013,699.
The- amount of second-class postage ob
tained from publishers and news agents
was $3,351,386. The inland mail shows an
expenditure for transportation of $54,781,
590 and the foreign account an expendi
ture of $1,935,701. The receipts from the
domestic money order system during the
year are shown to have been $1,915,462 and
the expenditures 566S.SG7, leaving a net rev
enue of $l,246,a!Kl. Notwithstanding this
favorable showing, the auditor says that
if charged its proper share of the expenses
of the service there would be shown a net
loss of at least $100,000 annually.
The report shows that the population of
the United States in 17.30 was 4.000,000; in
1900 it is over 75,000,000. The wealth of the
people In real and personal property prob
ably aggregated $2,000,000,000 in 1790, and is
conservatively estimated at $80,000,000,000

In 17M) and 7G.ii91 In 1900. The postal reve
nues were $37,975 in 1790 and $102,354,579 In
1900. Therefore, while the population of
the country has increased 19 to 1 in 119
years and the wealth of the people 40 to 1,

AN OFFICIAL VISIT
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1900,
agent of John M. Chretien, was heard by
Judee Dunne yesterday. The defense con
tends that the same Grand Jury that
found the first indictment, which was de
fective, found the second, and hence had
a fixed opinion before hearing the evi
dence in the case, which renders its acts
illegal. Judge Dunne Intimated that the
objection was well taken. Further argu
ment on the Issues involved will be heard
next week, however.
Nevlll was arrested and sent to the Hall
of Justice, charged with disturbing the
peace. After completing his run Ander
son was taken to the City Hall station

cause They Found Stock
ton's Twirler.
Oakland 7, Stockton 5.
A big red disc, set In a hazy western
sky, looked down upon Mr. Johnson, who
turned them loose yesterday afternoon at
Recreation grounds. ; Johnson . did stunts
upon the slab for the Millers. . He was a
bad actor in several ways, and, when the
casualties, of . battle .were segregated the
scorer found- that the; Dudes had hit Mr.
Johnson Just. thirteen times.V
* Before the game ; Johnson, who has an
extensive flesh adornment on his frame,
weighed two hundred and more. After it
was all over, he tipped ' the scales at 193.
To this strain^ he assigns the errors of his
pitching. ways. ; . ...
. The end of the third and the beginning
of the fourth were full of streaks. Man
gerlna and jDrennan, having earned
bases on hits, were smiling on the bags
when Francks. rolled out~ a deep center
field fly. Some fancy juggling when the
ball was : passed in gave all three men
golden opportunities and the boy at the
bell a chance to ring thrice when the in
ning., Â¦was over. - Â¦
But .this was tame compared to what
happened later on. With the bases
crowded by Streib, McHale and Graham
Courtney smeared his bat on the sphere'
which went so far it Jumped the fence'
That meant four runs and put Stockton
in the lead for a time.

smashed for many and the jrame was
clinched for the Dudes. The error column

Easily the most sumptuous restaurant
before tho remodeling in thi3 city, the
"Poodle Dos" must now be Acknowledged
the peer of any in the great West. Two
yeara ago the "Poodle Dos" restaurant,
corner Eddy and Mason streets, opened
its doors to the public, and such has been
the popular appreciation of Its service
that increased business has demanded in
creased accommodations. To that end the
proprietors, Messrs. Blanco and Brun.
closed' the place for two weeks, during
which time a complete transformation
has -taken' place. The capacity of the
main . dining-room haa been increased by
the addition of forty feet of space and
tho kitchen has-been removed to an ad-
Joining building specially constructed for
the purpose. 1 The kitchen has. been vastly
improved, and Its equipment greatly en
hanced. Not alone Is the Improvement
confined to the first floor. Each of tha
five upper stories has undergone a thor
ough renovation and new carpets and fur
niture of the most modern types hava
been added, with the purpose of keeping
this restaurant thoroughly representa.tlva
of all tha.t Is latest ana best. Special at
tention will hereafter be devoted to cater
ing - to theater parties, after-theater
luncheons and banquets. A new banquet
hall of ample space has been added on the
upper floor, as well as two elesant suites.
A new feature is an orchestra of eight
pieces that will render music at dinner,
supper and at Saturday's luncheon from
12 to 2 p. m. The decorations and orna
mentations of the "Poodle- Dos" are
worthy of extended description. They
are unequaled in richness and good taste.
The art centers of Europe have supplied
some rare selections, among: which may
be mentioned the crystal candelabra from
"Venice and some very choice specimens of
French statuary. The aim of the pro
prietors haa been to appeal not alone to
the physical - sense, the appetite, but to
the artistic sense of its patrons as well.

Drs. Louis Bazet, A. P. O'Brien and
Charles D. McGettigan were called by ths
District Attorney to testify as to Kelly's
condition. They had examined him in the
County Jail and found that he was suffer
ing from an incurable disease, but there
was nothing in his condition to lead to
the belief that h!s life would be shortened
by remair.lrg where he was at present.
The Judge reserved his decision till to
morrow, when he faJd he would probably
either order Kelly'* removal to the
branch County Jail, where the air Is
purer, or reduce his bonds.
Ke!ly Is in Jail awaiting the decision of
the Supreme Court on his appeal from
the. sentence imposed upon him for forg-
Jngr the name of a. man named RIley to
a bond he accepted. There Is also a
charge of perjury against him for swear
ing that Riley qualified before him on the
bond.

honesty, ability and firmness. M. C.

Mead his promissory note for the sum
named; that Root has not paid the same

commencement of this action. Judgmen:

The aspirants for stake honors In the
big- 12S-dog event at Union Park were
given much harder work than was looked
for in the run down yesterday. The hares,
which were thought to be of the ordinary
class, turned out to be a lively lot. As a
result many long courses were run and
on eight occasions the help of relief dogs
was necessary to put an end to the going.
The outlook for to-day points to Royal
Union and Palo Alto as the best. dogs on
the top of the card. This pair of fast
ones cannot meet until the fifth round,
which fact gives Reilly's hound the better
of the argument. Palo Alto, while un
doubtedly a fast one, has not established
himself a stayer in big stakes and the tal
ent's decision figures Union at that stage
of the game. As an outsider Mayflower
might get well along on the card, though
the hard go she had with Gold Hill, which
went over the two-minute limit, may af
fect her chances. Her first course against
Forest King looks doubtful.
Narcissus and Rocker at the bottom. of
the card are in strong favor. Like the
top favorites they cannot meet until the
fifth. The wise ones look for Narcissus
and Royal Union to contest in the decid
ing course. These hounds belong in the
high class and are about even on speed
and staying qualities. If the dogs do
come together it is predicted that they
will furnish a course worthy of any stake.
Slipper Jomes Grace sprained his ankle
during the early part of the day and will
probably be confined to his home for some
time. Charles Griswold finished the stake
and handled the dogs well.

APTAIN SEYMOUR Is satisfied
jf * that the two burglars arrested in
B , Chico last Thursday are the men
X^, J who attempted recently to crack
the safes in the offices of the
Brooks-Follis Electric Company, 523 Mis
sion street, the Bauer Lamp and Reflector
Company, 529 Mission street, and the Pa
clric Rolling Mills, 418 Mission street. At
these three places the cracksmen operated
by stringine wires from those used for
lighting purposes to the safes, where a
cartxjn attachment was arranged and so
designed as to burn its way through the
steel doors. At one place the operators
were disturbed before being able to com
plete the job and at the other two places
they had not enough wire to make the
necessary connection.
Captain Seymour saw the report of the
arrests in a dispatch from Chlco in The
Call, and at once wired to James Chub
buck, City Marshal, to send on a descrip
tion of the men. as he believed they were
Clarence FTench and Charles Tessier, â¢ex
convicts, whom he' had been wanting for
the safecracking Jobs here. Yesterday he
received a letter from Chubbuck confirm
ing his suspicions. French gave the name
of Charles Freeman, but Tessier gave his
true name. They are charged with break
ing into the residence of James Finnell, a
rancher In St. John, Glenn County, on
October 17, and stealing about $500 worth
addressed to W. Wolf, who Is supposed
to be a confederate in this city. Seymour
at once detailed Detective Byram to find
the case, but Byram learned, that It had
been called for and taken away the day
before and he could not get a clew to the
identity of Wolf. Detectives Harper and
O'Dea are now making a search of the
various pawnshops to find a trace of any
of the Jewelry or other articles stolen, ot
which they have a full description.
"I am convinced," said Captain Sey
mour yesterday, "that the prisoners are
the men who operated here and that they
had also planned to make an attempt on
the premises of the First National Bank,
Oakland. A valise containing electrl*
wires, nitro-glycerin and other instru
ments was found under the sidewalk at
the bank, evidently planted there for &
favorable opportunity. They have appar
ently a good case against the cracksmen
in Chico. but If not the men will ba
brought here. French is an electrical ex
pert, and that was why I suspected him."
French was sentenced on April 28. 1S93.
to serve ten years in San Quentln for
burglary. He broke into the store of D.
M. Hawley and blew open Beveral safes
besides carrying away a sample lock. He
was arrested by Detectives Bee and Har
per. He was released from San Quentln
October 13, 1899. He is about 27 years of
age. Tessler on May 31, 1893. was sen.
tenced to serve ten years in San Quentin
for felony embezzlement and was dis.
charged December 2, 1899. He had pre
viously served a short term in the County
Jail for petty larceny. He is about 37
years of age.
of Jewelry and also of breaking into J. J.
Hubbeli's hardware store In Chlco on
October 22 and stealing a large assort
ment of articles. They are also suspect
ed of having broken into Arend's saloon
in Chico and Miller's store In Butte City.
The men had been living at the Bidwell
ranch, near Chico, and their actions had
aroused Chubbuck's suspicions. Ho ar
rested French last Thursday morning and
locked him up In Jail, but through the
carelessness of the jailor the prisoner
managed to escape. Chubbuck was noti
fied and succeeded in rearrestlng him
after a hot chase. He also captured Tes
sler, who was found at the Bidwell ranch.
In their room at the ranch Chubbuck dis
covered a quantity of silverware, cloth-
Ing, gloves and other articles, besides four
revolvers and a shot gun that had been
stolen from Hubbeli's store. There 7 were
three valises In their room and Chubbuck
was paralyzed by what he found In them.
There was a pint bottle filled with nitro
glycerin, eleven sticks of giant powder,
caps, fuse and electrical apparatus for
making quick connection with electric
wires, an alarm bell and small battery,
hand drills and other drills, a pair of
brass knuckles, a black mask, a heavy
hammer, steel chisels, and about 100 skel
eton keys, besides a collection of general
hardware stolen from Hubbell's store and
an air pump for extracting the air from a
safe before blowing it up.
Chubbuck had notified Captain Seymour
that French had shipped a case to this
city marked "dried fruits," which was
supposed to contain a portion of the plun
der secured by the two burglars. It was

Rock then replk-d that Herman and
Wtnsloir were the absentee members.
The point made, however, was valueless,
as any thirteen jurors can find an lndict
ment.
Mrs. Craven, though outwardly more ro
bust locking than she has been for some
time, appeared terribly nervous and emac
iated. Yesterday morning she sat in an
apathetic doze, apparently oblivious to all
&mund her, waking up at intervals to
look wildly around and ask for water, of
which she drar.k at least a dozen glasses.
She still us. s h<?r orutche*? and her som-
T.'-r mode of dressing does not detract
from her generally wrecked appearance.
"I myself had thought of that," replied
Riordan, "but was afraid Mr. I>euprey
would object to It."
Ju.ipe Cook asked Riordaji if it would
not be simpler to find out the two who
were abst r.t.
Hit memory refreshed, all went merry
as a wedding bell, until in reply to Rior
dan's qupsilon Rock said that seventeen
Jurors had been present on the day the in
.ictment had been found.
"Ah:" said Riordan. "Now tell us, will
you. who these were?"
"I object to that, your Honor," eald
Dcuprey.
Tne testimony of T. H. Parrish. a Grand
Jury ir.an, was unimportant, but caused
much legal wraiiKllne between the two
aitcrueys and served to till the time until
Rock reappeared with nis records.
John \V. Carmar.y, the foreman of the
Grand Jury, was even more unprofitable
th&ji ha.d been Rock. Riordan tried to
bring out the point that the indictments
found apalr.st Mrs. Craven. Adolph Sylva
and Judge Simpton were all made on ev.
dfiKe obtained at the same time, the three
cases bein^r taken collectively, and not on
c-vidtr.ee heard indivjduaJiy.
The first witness the defense put on the
stand was K. R. Rock, the secretary of
i he Grand Jury which found the indict
ment agair.M the defendant, lie proved
exceedingly cautious". To questions put to
him regarding the time of day when thÂ«
indictrrent w^s found, the number of jn
rors present and others of the same na
ture he professed an entire lapse of mem
ory as to anything connected with tha
matter. . Tliordan then asked him if he
thought C â¢> .'k at the records would en-
Iiehten hi* mind. Rock said that ho
thought \K nkely. After numerous objec
tions from Attorney Ueuprey, all based
on the assumption "that to introduce the
Grand Jury records in court would be to
l>robe in the secrets of that body and
tgainst the code, Rock was dispatched to
get his books.
Mrs. Xettla R. Craven sat In Judge
Cooks courtroom yesterday morning in a
ftate of apparent unconsciousness, while
h^r attorney. Thomas Riordan. fought
hard to get the Indictment of the Grand
Jury charging her with perjury set asiae.
Riordan undertook to establish that tiie
Grand Jury Â»ss prejudiced by newspaper
articles and outside influences. To prove
his case Riordan called to the stand the
secretary, foreman and one of the mem
bers of the body in question! It was an
uphill fight against the thickest objections
of Assistant District Attorney EugesÂ«
Deoprejr. and Riordan lost. Judge Cook

ar.d to-morrow morning Riordan will tile

THE SUPPER-ROOM
AT THE PALACE
TO BE REOPENED
Superintendent Webster says he recent
ly recommende-d on additional teacher in
the Bernal School owing toMts overcrowd
ed condition. The board, however, Web-
Hter says. Is bent on dissolving the class,
and for that reason keeps sending substi
tutes to Miss Keating instead of giving
her a regular teacher.
The board met in the morning and
passed the demand for labor of P. M.-Wel
lin, inspector of repairs to public school
buildings. The Board of Public Works
had previously employed Wellin for one
day in order to test its power to repair
school buildings and pay for thÂ« same out
of the common school tund. "W'ellin's de
mand was taken to Superintendent Web
ster, who has questioned the method of
making school repairs by the Board of
Public Works to be paid for by the Board
of Kducation. Webster stated that he
would refor the matter to his attorney
anÂ«l be guided entirely by the latter's ad
vice.
"I must insist on having a teacher regu
larly assigned to the class," said Miss
Keating, who was apparently excited, but
Elncere in her appeal. "I want a teacher
upon whom I can rely and with whom the
children may become acquainted. As it is
now I am supplie(J"*Â»:ith a new teacher
every week or so. Affairs on that account
are very unsettled in my school, and I am
unable to produce the best results unless
the Board of Kducation is disposed to aid
me In my efforts."
Chairman Mark and Director Denman
both promised that the board would take
action on Miss Keating's complaint at the
next meeting. Mark stated that it was
the understanding of the board that the
attendance in the Bernal School did not
warrant the assignment of a regular
te*acher. but if conditions were found as
Mis? Keating represented them to be a
regular teacher would be assigned to the
school immediately.
Miss Keating complains that one of her
classes, comprising the fourth and fifth
grades, has been taurht by substitute
teachers ever rince the opening of the
school term. No less than live different
eubstitutes had been sent to her during
the past three months to assume charge
of one class. The result was the pupils
were becoming demoralized and the disci
pline had greatly deteriorated.
The Board of .Kducation's persistent de
nial that the public schools are not over
crowded received a severe setback yester
day when. Miss Mary E. Keating made a
vigorous plea to Chairman Mark that an
additional regular teacher be assigned to
the Bernal Primary School, of which she
is principal. .... -

courts and 'stop the progress of '.other
cases, thus causing a great deal of that de
lay in getting final decisions which is so
vexatious to the public and so harmful', to
business. M. < C. .Sloss, Republican candi
date for Judge of the Superior Court,
possesses in himself the sterling requisites
for the position, besides the educational
and professional requirements. Mr. Sloss
is the son of Louis Sloss of the Alaska
Commercial Company of this city; he
therefore comes from sterling Republican
stock and is fairly entitled to some part of
the family good will. Mr. Sloss, however,
is abundantly able" to stand on his own
merits as a candidate from a judicial
standpoint, for no better equipped young
man was ever proposed for a judgeship in
this city. He received his education here
in our public schools, and when the voters
of the city go over the list of candidates
for Superior Judge they will find none
more worthy of support than Mr. Sloss.
Under our system of elections candidates
for all offices are nominated on party
tickets. so Mr. Sloss stands as aRepublican
nominee, but no man will more truly rep
resent upon the bench the desire of the
whole people for an Impartial, non-parti
san and upright judiciary.
Mr. SIofs, while still a young man, 1b
well known in legal and commercial cir
cles. His training for the bar has been
thorough, and in his practice he has been
engaged in some of the most important
cases before the courts of recent years.
Mr. Sloss was prepared for the univer
sity at Belmont. He graduated from
Harvard in 1S90 and immediately entered
the Harvard law school, taking his degree
in 1S93. Returning to this city for the
practice of his profession, he became a.
member of the firm of Chlckerlng. Thom
as & Gregory, and has been with the firm
for seven years. During his study and In
his practice he has given his special at
tention to commercial law and probate
law. two branches of the profession of
great importance In this city, wnere such
large commercial interests are at stake
and such great estates to be administered.
The systematic and careful training
which Mr. Sloss has had at Harvard and
in the seven years of his practice will en
able him to give decisions that will stand
the test of the higher court and thus save
time and expense to litigants. That he
will be impartial and faithful to the best
traditions of the bench is not to be doubt
ed. His election will therefore be a public
benefit, and he merits the support of all
good citizens, irrespective of party.
The people of San Francisco who have
any business with the courts are well
aware of the value to the community of
having upon the bench a Superior Judge
who is well grrounded on the principles of
law. A large part of our litigation is due
to the errors of Judges whose decisions
the Supreme Court has to overrule.. The
new trials ordered in these" cases block the

His remarks were frequently- interrupted
by applause. In a forceful speech he
urged his listeners to maintain the dig

est manifested for the laborer by the Re
publican administration. Mr. Wolf Â¦ told
of the good work done by Congressman

voters of his district were appreciative
and thankful for the good work of a Rep
resentative who had faithfully served
their interest. Several other speakers ad
dressed the meeting.

A RECITAL extraordinary was
the Enid Brandt first appear
1 ance on Thursday evening
last. The little girl, third In
the trinity of child wonders to
appear for the first time before the public
this season, is undoubtedly a prodigy. She
has a phenomenally quick ear. and her
sense of absolute pitch has been given an
amusing and clever turn through the evo
lution of a system of so-called "musical
telegraphy," by which she spells out any
given sentence through the striking of
certain notes upon the piano. The alpha
bet is of course a simple matter, given
the sense of absolute pitch, but little Miss
Brandt's extreme readiness of ear, by
which she instantly distinguishes between
the twenty-Six sounds Included in the al
phabet. 1st certainly astonishtntr and al
most uncanny. . . ..
There is much that is uncanny about the
whole performance. To see the tiny
thingâ she is but 8 years old and not large
for her tender ageâ giving out the Mos
kowski A flat "Valse," the Mendelssohn
"Hondo Capriccioso." the Chopin G flat
"Valse," with ample power and astonish
ing ease of execution, is nothing short of
marvelous. It gives one an almost pain
ful sense of a soul too large for the lit
tle frame, a precocity of development
that shall later spell sacrifice, but the
great masters have early shown their
wonderful gifts, and it may be as natural
and healthful in this case as In theirs.
Enid's remarkable technical facility has
been before commented upon, and there
is already evident a characteristic tem
perament In the renderings which is. not
altogether admirable. Her playing lacks
almost altogether the poetic quality, .the
romantic air, and it is not too much to
expect these of one of Enid Brandt's re
markable development. Her work is of
the brilliant, bravura order, -without pian
issimo, rallentando or any of the instinc
tive tricks of delicate shading, and if it
be not that her teacher has feared for
her a too excessive emotional develop
ment and trained her accordingly In a
mechanical school, then is the little geniU3
lacking In the finer requirements of her
act.
She wilt give two additional recitals at
Sherman-Clay Hall on November 8 and 10.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
The Damrosch recitals have been very
largely attended this week by the Wag
ner cult, and this eloquent, reverent, clear
and simple exposition of the "Ring"
should be heard by every musician who
hopes at any time to hear this most won
derful of all the wonderful Wagnerian
conceptions. The stories, noble, lofty, im
mense imaginations as they are, gain
grace in Mr. Damrosch's telling, and- the
various symbolic themes will find a clear
er bearing, a warmer greeting when the
great trilogry is given for the first time
here during the coming opera season.
The remaining recitals, when "Sieg
fried" and "Die Gotterdammerung* 1 will
be given, are set for Monday, November
5, and Wednesday. November 7.
The prjeceding concise and Interesting
account of the new Symphony Hall Is
pathetically suggestive at the present
turn of affairs symphonic In'San Francis
co; and hear further the celebrated critic.
Henry T. Fink, on the musical virtues of
the good Bostonians. In the Evening
Post he says:
Boston's new symphony hall was opened on
October 15 with a special concert, whereat
Colcnel F. L. Hlgginson made a Bpeech and
Owen Wister read a poem. The new hall Is in
the Back Bay district, on the corner of Mas
sachusetts and Huntington avenues. It cost
$750.000r of which $410,000 was raised by sub
scription and the rest borrowed. Charles Me-
Kim. of Â» New York was the architect. the
acoustics were studied by Professor Sabtne of
Harvard and other wise Boston men helped
In the construction. The hall seats 2500 per
sons. So far as could be judged on the open
ing, night It Is excellently suited to. Its. pur
pose. Colonel Hlgginson. the chief stay and
support of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, for
which the hall was built, is one of Boston's
most useful and public-spirited citizens, and
seems to have an* Incorrigible propensity to
undertake enterprises not promising In a
pecuniary sense, but which Boston needs to
have carried out. He told how the hall had
been built by "certain citizens of Boston,
without retard to return in money," and said
he had leased it from the directors for ten
years, agreelnc to meet all charges and ex
penses and pay the stockholders the rest of the
receipts.
Says Harper's Weekly:
Miss Ernestine Goldmann gave a force
ful and picturesque rendering of a Men
delssohn "Andante" and "Presto Agita
to." Miss Goldmann has a clean, robust
execution and much technical facility.
Others contributing to the evening's en
tertainment were Mme. de Seminario,
who gave the altogether charming "Car
raval" of Spohr, with an effective four
hand accompaniment played by Mrs. J.
X. Odell and Wallace A. Sabin: Miss
Harriette Simons, who sang two songs
by Liza Lehmann, Macfarrcn. and an old
Irish croon; and Miss Beulah George and
Miss Zueletta Geerv. wno gave the
Rubinstein duet, "The Angel."
The Eastern press is concerning itself
to a large extent over Boston symphony
matters just now and as we have sym
phony matters of our own just atÂ« pres
ent some Quotations anent the situation
will' not come amiss.
Mr." Holmes himself gave two numbers,
a Mozart sonata in G, with Mrs. J. W.
Odell at the pianoforte, and the Schu
mann "Maerchenbilder," for viola, accom
panied by Miss Ernestine Goldmann. It
is long since 1 have heard Mozart, with
his exquisite old world qualntness, ren
dered in such graceful and spiriluelle
fashion. Mr. Holmes was at his -best in
the number, with his pure, tine tone, deli
cacy of shading and finished phrasing,
and the hearty applause which greeted
the sonata was a distinctly encouraging
sign of a sound musical taste among the
concert-going community.
An Interesting programme was that
provided by Henry Holmes for tne Britisli
Benevolent Society benefit concert on
Monday evening last at Sherman-Clay
Hall.
Next week a meeting of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Society hoard of direc
tors will bo called, and all musical San
Francisco wonders what will be done. If
only a second Colonel Hlgginson should
arise? And why not? This is one of the
richest cities in the Union; there is here
as much public spirit and Indisputably
more native musical talent (admittedly
crude) to the square Inch than Is found In
any other city In the Union. Carreno sig
nifies her strong desire to play with our
symphony orchestra; ..Gerardy would
bring his cello a small matter of 3000 miles
with the same Intent; Fannie -.iOomfleld-
Zelsler would like nothing better than
to renew her acquaintance with San Fran
cisco audiences under the same auspices,
and we have almost all the necessary in
struments well represented In the town
and little Indeed seems lacking but finan
cial backing. Where is Colonel Hlggin
son II?
â¢ â¢ â¢
Yet one more quotation, by your leave,
dealing with the important financial side
of the question, from the Musical Cou
rier. Alter estimating the season's re
turns of the symphony concerts and ap
parently proving their present paying ba
sis, tho Courier has this to say:
At the lowest estimate Mr. Hlgginson' â¢
protit must be at least 10 per cent of this and
he will therefore find himself very readily re
imbursed for the outlay, the incidental an
nnync<! and the risk, from which he has now
obtained immunity. All this illustrates thai
music can be made successful without gov
ernmental subvention or subsidy if it is man
aged like a coal mine U or a railroad or an
oil company or a clothing factory or a cotton
mill or a piano business. We with to call
special attention of impracticable musical folk
to this important feature of the Boston Sym
phony Orchestraâ its correct - and modernized
business organization, which is the true basis
of Its success and which makes it Impossible
for the orchestra to play for nothing. The
Boston Symphony Orchestra despite its art,
despite its Nlklsch, Us Paur and its Gerlcke,
could not endure one month without equipoised,
scientific business management, its success de
pending absolutely upon this and this alone,
as is proved in the case of Mr. Hlgginson, and
therefore the orchestra could not play without
money to Indorse it, as thÂ« money is the first
ingredient of its existence. So it should be
with every other musical institution and in
dividual living and -working In music; money
for music; no money, no music. Then only
can music nourish.
Boston â¢ is pre-eminently a concert town.
Opera has never flourished here .as it does in
New York, and Mr. Grau usually considers
himself lucky if after five successful months in
New York, which may yield him a profit of
$100,000. .Boston endures his world.-famed sing
ers three weeks without depleting his pockets.
But Instrumental music is more highly es
teemed than in New York. The twenty-four
annual concerts of the Boston 8ymphony Or
chestra, rounded in 1881 through the generosity
of Henry Lee Hlgrglnson, are the great musical
events of the season, more important than a
Paderews=kl recital or a performance of "Sieg
fried": and to have it announced in the papers
that she paid the highest premium for her
seats at the symphony concerts flatters the
vanity of a Boston society woman as much as
it does a New York society woman's to have
it known that she owns one of the most ex
pensive boxes at the Metropolitan Opera-house.

after mature consideration, and none of

equaling his brother Tod. who in my opin
ion, after Tom Lane, in his best days, is
the greatest jockey that the world has
seen, is a good rider. Freeman is a first

not only this. I have often seen an Ameri

customed to the new style of riding,

"The question of 'doping:,' as It is called
In 'the United States, has entered Into a
new phase. 'Dopins' to lose Is ancient his

that he may win is the owner's rights and.

jockeys for whom their own country ow

"My opinion Is that we should strive

LONDON. Nov. %. â The Prince of
Wales' dismissal of Tod Sloan is received
with Joy by the racing -world of England
as a significant indication of the feellnp
against American jockeys and trainers.
The Prince of Wales yielded to the popu
lar clamor. While the methods and, man
ners of a number of self-advertislns
American owners have undoubtedly given
the jockev club an excuse for its present
attitude there is little doubt that jeal
ousy of the continued American success
had more than anything else to do with,
the matter. There are many indications.
too,.that the campaign against the- Amer
ican horsemen was not undertaken with
out plenty of premeditation. This Is
evidenced by the sporting columns of al
most every da,H>" paper in Knsrland. an't
many of the best weeklies*, which are rev
elling in the chance of a slur at American
jockeys.
Truth cannot find words of vituperation
enough wherewith to denounce Sloan and
all the others it can reach. But the great
est glee of all prevails In the London
sporting clubs and cafes where the Eng
lish turf gamblers assemble to settle bet
ting. The gamblers who for years havf>
held the English turf by the throat an.l
who finally found all their calculations
smashed by the American successes,
hope to be able to resume their trade.
Sloan is much chagrined. His retainer
â¢was to have been Â£3000. He had, other of
fers of like amount, but now thai tha
Prince of Wales has thrown him over no
English owner Is likeiy to employ him an

the weather resembled an In
dian summer aiid between seven and
eight thousand person* honored the Cali
fornia Jockey Club by their presence at
Oakland track yesterday. Not unllkt
other first days, the grand stand pre
sented a most animated appearance,
crowded as It was with magnificently at
tired women attended by stylishly
dressed men. Groups of fashionables of
both sexes dotted the lawn surrounding
the clubhouse, scanning the programmes
or watching the warming up gallops, and
politics were quietly, discussed In -shel
tered nooks of the veranda. Â¦ In the ring,
where the twenty bookmakers held high
carnival, there was a surging .mass of
speculators and tips were flying about
thicker, than quills, on a hedgehog. Â«T'ne
big bettors were inciint-d to remain under
cover, though there appeared to be no
dearth of small money. "An old stago
horse never forgets the crack of the
whip," 'tis said. and*the veterans were
mustered in force.
If the unhappy 'start of the handicap
can be excepted, an entirely unavoidable
occurrence, the afternoon's sport passed
off without hitch or accident. It was far
from being a favorite day, for the short
end players were early gasping for
breath. Rolling Boer and Bangor, both
from the stable of Sam Hildreth, proved
the only successful choices, while Miss
Rowena, Mike Rice. The Fretter and Pan
amint sent the "pikeis" home In jubi
lant mood. The track had dried out suf
ficiently to be good, but not fast.
Presiding Judge Murphy and his asso
ciate. Charles F. Price, were asked to do
cide one or two very ciose finishes, which
they did to the entire satisfaction of the
blp gathering. Starter James F. Caldwell
dispatched the fields with the Maxwell
starting machine, his work in general be
ine: highly commended.
Nobody eeemed to get real busy until
the Opening handicap, valued at $1500 and
fourth on the card, was called. Mortgage,
the Burns & Waterhouse entry, with 102
pounds and J. Ranch up. had been cutting
up all sorts of pranks with time over at
Ingleslde. and of the eight starters was
delegated to carry the bulk of the coin,
closing a 3 to 2 favorite. Among the oth
ers Rosormond*. Modrine and Formero
were fancied. In the order named. At the
post Caldwell sent the bunch away ex
cellently aligned, but owing to some slight
misuse of the recall flag all of the riders
with the exception of Jack Martin, on the
10 to 1 shot The Fretter. besnn pulllnj; up
at the first turn. Quickly learning of, the
mistake all sail was set and a stern chasi
began for the leader. It proved a futile
one. for the outsider maintained his lead
to the end.- finishing two lengths before
Modrine and Flush of Gold In 1:41^. No
actual line could.be had on. the horses,
and a race at the same distance with like
weights up would be a drawing card.
The Burns & Waterhouse stable started
off well by annexing the introductory
scramble with Miss Rowena. ' The chest

won all the way. February, with a hard
luck tale to spin, disposed of Novla for
the. place. Backers of Bullman came to
erief In this number. Hlldreth started
.Vulcain. but the horse seemed as anxious
to leave the post as a hungry dog would
a bone; never Ving in it.
On top of this came the advent on the
scene of Mike Rice, a 30 to 1 chance. Mike
figured to finish almost anywhere, and In
a face finish his number was hoisted over
Merry Boy. Briar Hill, the favorite, was
seized with a feeling of ennui before the
tape was reached.
Next came the two-year-old event. Sam
Hildreth had In Rolling Boer, a choice
piece of horseflesh, and the books were
kind enough to lay 9 to 10 about him. Bull
man had the K'K up. and rating along to
the stretch with Articulate there forged
ahead, winning at leisure. Grafter fin
ished gamely, trking the place from Ar
ticulate.
Sam Hlldreth followed this victory up
by capturing the mile and a sixteenth run
with Bangor. As good as 2& to 1 was laid
against the horse, and he was at least
twenty minutes the best. Coming from
the far rear and' tramping, all around the
bunch, the chestnut finished two lengths
In advance of Lena and Castake, both
rank outsiders.
Nearly all of the Easterners spread it
about good and thick on Wooster Boy, an
other Hlldreth entry, to win the conclud
ing ' recital. The tickets once looked
cashed, then the hot one began stopping,
and Panamint, a 15 to 1. shot, scored by a
long length in ordinary time. Pat Morrls

Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD fNlVERSITT? Nov.
3. â The Stanford varsity football
team won the most decisive vic
tory of th^ season here to-day,
literally "wiping up the earth""
with the Reliance Athletic Club team.
Though tne day was hot for fast
'laying:, the cardinal team played I'm
tastett and bc-st game of the season. Re
liance had the ball but little of the time
end -was forced to punt constantly. Stan
ford's work on the defense fhowed mar
velous improvement over that displayed
at any previous time this wason. Tne
forwards were especially actlvÂ« and fstt.
Seeley and Gregory of the center trio were
invincible, while the work of Tracer and
Burnett at tackles was of the briiliant
order. Captain Burnett showed a return
of his old-time vim and tackled all over
the field.
The club men were equal to the varsity
in weight, but did not put up such a
strong cams on the defensive as shown
here three weeks ago. They are to be
commended on the clean, hard game
which they played in an up'.iill fight. To
Hamilton, Dinsmore and Weir is due the
credit of preventing a more lopslaed
ccore.
The feature of The game was Traeger"s
place kicking of seals from the field. Ten
points of the score are due to Ills ac
curacy. One was from the twenty-five
and another frÂ»m the thirty-five yard lint.
As each try was successful; the ball sal*.
lng squarely between the goal posts, it is
likely that he will be tried often during
the Thanksgiving: game.
Sranford'F wonderful showing came in
the nature cf a surprise, as the wise ones
had the clubmen scheduled for a victory.
To-day's game closes a brilliant season
for Stanford against the Reliance team,
u all three game? of the series have gontj
to the college men by a total score o'
Â£5 to 0. Stanford's goal line has not been
crossed this year except by a team com
posed of its own alumni. Gregory, who
played center in to-day's match, gives
promise of developing into a fine center
rush. He is not eligible for varsity hon
ors this year, however, being in special
standing.

eff to Smith, who ran it 35 yards. Two
end runs by Smith netted 40 yards. Hill

tory over the Santa Clara College eleven
a-t the Eixtecnth and Folsom street
Grounds by a eeore of 12 to 0. The game
was played before about 500 spectators
and was uninteresting. Both teams were
composed of crippled players, and after
every scrimmage time had to be taicen
out for ths lads to recover from knocks
and bruise*. Santa Clara was woefully
weak on the- defensive, and Lowell's backs
vere ablo to make thÂ»Â»ir Grains without
trouble. Â¦ The Santa Clara, team had hard
work tryi'iff to pierce Lowell's line. Punt
ing was their only salvation, and they re

LIVERMORE Nov. 3.âCongress
man Victor H. Metcalf deliv
ered his last address of the cam
paign outside of his home city
to-night in Llvermore. It was
the closing of the Republican campaign,
and was one of the most remarkable dem
onstrations of political enthusiasm that
ever took place in this city. The Liver
more brass band was out and played in-
Bpiringly. There were bonfires all through
the city and fireworks and all kinds of
noise. The meeting was held In the Farm
ers' Union Theater and the place was
filled to overflowing.
The meeting was called to order by
Thomas Knox, county commltteeman from
this township. Mr. Knox said a few words,
urging that the Republican ticket be sup
ported from President to Assemblymen,
and Introduced ex-Assemblyman F. R.
Fassett as the chairman of the evening.
Mr. Fassett made a clever address, show
ing the Importance to the country of con
tinuing the Republican administration In
power and calling attention to the neces
sity of sending a solid Republican legis
lative delegation from this county.
Short addresses were made by Superior
Judf?e F. B. Ogden, C, F. Homer, Repub

Mattoft Jr. Republican nominee for the
Assembly. Judge Ogden spoke for his ab
sent comrade. Judge John Ellsworth, and

candidacy. Mr. Homer said a few words
expressing the hope that the people of
Llvermore would look with favor upon hia
candidacy. . , ,.
1 John G. Mattos made quite an address,
that created a very favorable Impression
upon his audience. He told of his life,
how he had been brought up and edu
cated until he was admitted to the bar,
and how he had always been a Republican
and loved the principles of that party.
Then he touched upon the fight that is be
ing made against him because of his na
tionality. "I was born of Portuguese
parentage," he said, "but that was not
my fault and 1 am none the less an
American and I love this country Just as
much as any of those who sit here to
n 6ongressman Victor H. Metcalf was
given a magnificent reception when he
arose to speak, and so interesting were
his remarks that none left during his talk.
He dealt with national questions, with the
condition and future of the Philippines,
Hawaii and Porto Rico.
"Support the whole ticket, exclaimed
Mr. Metcalf, "and elect those true leaders
of the American people, McKinley and
Roosevelt."
BIG BEPTTBLICAN" MEETING.
Presentation of Political Truths by
the Orators Vociferously Greeted.
Pioneer Hall was filled last night with a
crowd of enthusiastic Republicans. For.
an hour before the meeting was called to
order skyrockets, bombs and ' roman
candles were set oft*, attracting a crowd
which soon blocked the street. When the
stock of fireworks was exhausted a brass
band entertained the crowd with patri
otic and popular music. At 8 o'clock the
tand entered the hall, followed by the
hundreds that filled the streets.
The meeting was called to order by
Leon Samuels, who in a short speech
made known that the affair was a meet
ing of the Republicans of the Twenty
ninth Assembly District. Following Mr.
Samuels the Knickerbocker quartet sang
a campaign song and for an encore ren
dered a popular selection.
The speaker of the evening, W. R. Da
vis, Republican candidate for Presidential
Elector, was then introduced and ten
dered a rousing reception. Mr. Davis said
in part;
It U an easy matter to settle the claims of
Democracy as put forth by Democratic ora
tors. Their particular bugbears are imperial
ism, militarism and trusts. These are para
mount Issues of the campaign in the eyeg of
our Democratic friends. The need of a stand
ing army of 65,000 men does not constitute mill
tarlem, aa In this great country the keeping:
of such an army would call for but 86-100 of a
roldler to each 1000 Inhabitants. In Austria,
Italy, France, Turkey, to maintain the stand
ing armies requires the presence of from 6 to
14 men to each 1000 Inhabitants. The army this
country should stand In fear of is the Im
mense army of 600,000 unemployed people who
started to march from San Francisco to Wash
ington In 1&94. Such a spectacle has never been
seen In an administration ruled by the Ke
publlcan party.
The question of trusts Mr. Davis dis
posed of with a few remarkg. He re
minded the audience that the leaders of
tho New York Democracy. Croker and the
Van Wyck brothers, were the principal
stock owners In many gigantic trusts In
the Empire City.
Julius Kahn was then introduced and
addressed the audience for a few mo
ments on national Issues. He was greet
ed with cheers when he announced as his
platform "Get all the benefits possible for
California and San Francisco." Mr. Kahn
spoke of his efforts in the last session in
Congress and outlined clearly his opposi
tion to any measures which would open
the doors of this country to Chinese or
Japanese labor.
A song dedicated to Mr. Kahn waa sung
by Joseph Hanson and greeted with
cheers.
Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy was the next
speaker, and his speech was a reiteration
of the remarks of the orators who pre
ceded him. In regard to his own candi
dacy the Judge was willing that his rec
ord as Superior Judge should stand for
cause for his re-election.
L. L. Loofbourow of Stanford Univer
sity explained to the audience the mean-
Ing of the amendment for the passage of
which the students are so vigorously
working.
Thomas F. Graham, candidate for Su
perior Judge: Thomas F. Dunn, who is
seeking a re-election to the office of Jus
tice of the Peace, and Jeremiah Collins,
candidate for the Assembly from the
Twenty-ninth District, also addressed the
meeting.. Thomas McConnell. president of
the Shipwrights' Union of San Francisco,
spoke in behalf of Julius Kahn, telling
the audience how the mechanics in his
branch of labor were treated by the Con
gressman.
During the evening the drill corps of the
Bear Club marched thpough the hall and
were greeted with cheers. The corps re
turned the salute with three rousing
cheers for McKinley and three more for
the Twenty-ninth Assembly District Club.

terful one. - . â¢ .
Mr. Coombs will undoubtedly be elected.
It Is only a question of majority. This
rally closed the campaign In Sonoma. The
Republican ticket will carry the town and
district beyond doubt. -_

NEEDHAM GETS AN OVATION.
Industrial Parade and Mass Meeting
at Fresno.
FRESNO, Nov. 3.â Fresno County and
city to-night gave Congressman Needham
the greatest ovation ever tendered any
candidate for office In the San Joaquln
Valley. He arrived In Fresno at 6 o'clock
and was met at the depot by the military
band and' a> vast concourse of people. At
7 o'clock an industrial parade, represent
ing every line of business In the county,
formed and marched through the streets
of the raisin city. Among the interesting
features was a uniformed company of 200
Rough Riders.
The Barton Opera-house, where Mr.
Needham and J. A. Barham spoke, was
crowded to the doors and every pointed
utterance was greeted with enthusiastic
applause. The orators dwelt on the so
called issues the Democratic party has
raised in this campaign and showed their
fallacy. Mr. Needham said that there
was only one Issue and that was the issue
of prosperity. The question was whether
or not the people wanted to abandon the
policy that had led up to the present times
of plenty or go back to the Democratic
policy of hard times and soup houses.
Mr. Barham paid especial attention to
the statements made some time ago by
Stephen M. White that he (ex-Senator
White) was responsible for the present
tariff on raisins and declared the claim
was entirely unfounded. â¢
From every standpoint the meeting was
a success and Republicans are now claim
ing that McKinley will carry the county.

TO THE MASS-MEETING AT SCOTTISH HALL, WHERE THE MEMBERS OF BOTH ORGANIZATIONS LISTENED TO ADDRESSES BY PROMI
NENT SPEAKERS.
GREAT Republican rallies were
held throughout the State and
in five districts of San Fran
cisco last night. Indications
are that the full registered vote
cf the party will be cast day after to
morrow. It is estimated by conservative
judges that California's majority for Mc-
Klnley and Roosevelt will exceed fifteen
thousand. Many prefllctJons place the
figure as high as twenty-five thousand.
The defeat of Bryan is practically con
ceded by his supporters. In this city the
Democrats are putting forward special
efforts to win a Congressman in the
Fourth District.
During the past week considerable vita>
lty ha6 been. Infused Into the campaign
on behalf of Porter Ashe. At the noon
hour yesterday he addressed an audience
cf fifteen hundred men at the Risdon Iron
Works. Republicans, however, are con
fident of Julius Kahn's re-election, but
there is always danger in over-confidence.
The normal Democratic majority in the
district approximates four thousand. The
Republican party was betrayed by H. C.
Dibble in 1S91. when the Legislature made
the apportionment for ten years. He got
the railroad company to promise him a.
nomination for Congress and then used
all the skill he.possessed to twist the lines
of the Fifth Congressional District, in
â¢which he lives, so that it would be over
whelmingly Republican. The lines of the
Fourth District were also traced hither
and thither, so as to surround as many
strong Democratic Assembly districts aj
could be put tog-ether in one Congres
sional District. The whole purpose of the
apportionment was selfish. The redistrict
ing was made to serve the political ends
of Dibble. As a result Democrats were
enabled to elect a Representative to Con
gress from the Fourth in every contest
until the pound money Democrats began
to vote with the Republicans.
Dibble is particularly anxious to get
back to the Assembly so that he can have
another chance to dicker with the Demo
cratic bosses and railroad agents on the
apportionment for the next decade. Every
liepubllcan in the Forty-first Assembly
IMstrict who values the future welfare of
the party should vote next Tuesday for
Oscar Eutro, the Citizens* Republican
nominee for the Assembly. The Call un
derstands that the leading Republicans
of the district â the substantial citizens
and property owners who have always
been true to the principles of the party â
arc out openly against Dibble. It is well
kno-vn to. intelligent people throughout
the district that Dibble is the candidate
of Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmlns.
Judge James A. Maymire returned from
the East day before yesterday. He talked
recently with Hanna, Payne and other
leaders of the Republican cause. In
Washington Judge Waymire saw the
President and had quite a chat with him
on California topics. President McKinley
is now confident that the Republican
national ticket will win.
Yesterday Judge Waymire wired to the
President that California would go Re
publican and elect a solid Republican
Congressional delegation. The Judge esti
mates that McKinley's majority in New
York will exceed one hundred thousand.
When the Phelanites and Bryanltes
met In State convention at San Jose last
September they fancied that a clever
etroke of politics to catch the interior
vote would be a plank in the platform
pledging all Democratic nominees for the
Legislature uÂ» vote for the abolition of
tolls on the water front of San Francl.Â«co.
Governor Gape exposed the scheme in his
Tresno speech. Here Is what he said:
And while we are touching upon the flnan-
i dal situation let me call your attention to the
I plank in the Democratic State platform, adopt
! Â«Hl at San Jose In September of this year, which
I IT carried out would raise not only farm taxes
I but all other taxes 10 per cent groes. They de
clcre in the following words in that platform:
"The growing commerce of our State requires
the early completion of the sea wall and the
belt-line railroad on the hajbor front of San
Francisco, and the abolition or all State tolls,
and a material reduction of all other port
charges. Our candidates for the Legislature
are hereby pledged to carry out this policy."
The revenue of that port at San Francisco to
I the Ftate aggregates monthly about $50,000, the
i last month running as high as $60,0u0, as my
| memory now serves me. These revenues are
principally paid and realized from foreign ehlp
! owners and frcm foreign merchandise; and no
| tolls are now collected on wheat or flour or
I cereals, and the State under the present man
j agement does not pay any taxes whatever to
maintain the water front of San Francisco,
j ar.d all cf the revenues are required in order
I to keep pace with the growing commercial ln
| tereet of the water front at San Francisco be
i longing to the State and' to pay off liabilities
Incurred in the past. If these State toll? should
| be abolished, as demanded by this plank of the
Democratic platform (end to which policy every
Democratic candidate for the Assembly and
Senate is pledged), we must of necessity add
to the tax roll of this Btate $50,000 per month,
or at least $600,000 per year, which would in
crease taxes 10 per cent on every bit of prop
! erty within the State, so that every Democratic
I Senator and every Democratic Assemblyman
j should be defeated unless the people are de
j ulrous of carrying out this terrific pledge of the
| Democratic party, increasing our taxes 10 per
'Â¦ cent.
It is evident that some stupid or dishonor
able Democratic politician of San Francisco
thought by this plank he was pledging the
Democratic carty to a scheme which would
compel farmers and other people of the outside
district to pay this tax for the especial benefit
of San Francisco, but the real effect of this
scheme will be not only to burden the farm
ers of the State with a 10 per cent raise in their
taxes, but also to add 10 per cent to the taxes
of San Francisco. Therefore, as before stated,
this pledRe made by the Democratic party
ought to defeat every candidate nominated for
the Assembly and Senate by the Democrats of
this State.
The pledge to which Governor Gage re
fers should eurely defeat Mr. O'Connell,
the Democratic nominee for the State
Senate In the Twenty-fifth Senatorial Dis
trict and cause the election of J. H. Nel
son, the Republican candidate. Hundreds
of families, many Industrial establish
ments, stores and workshops of this dis
trict, which embraces a vast frontage on
the bay, are sustained by the wages of
workingmen. If the tolls were abolished
the employment of labor to keep the
wharves in repair would be abolished.
The Democratic nominee may back and
nil at home on matters concerning his
district, but If he gets into party caucus
of the Legislature he will have to stand
by the pledge of the State platform.
Phelan will be there, if necessary, to
watch him.

ENTHUSIASTIC REPUBLICANS.
Major F. A. Pettus was introduced as
the chairman of the evening at last
right's meeting in Apollo Hall on Pacific
Street between Stockton and Powell,
which was attended by en enthusiastio
audience. The voters of the Forty-third
Assembly District gathered in large num
bers and testified their loyalty to the Re
Â§ublican par;y by cheering the names of
IcK-i:iley ana lioo^evelt and that of Con
gressman Julius Kahn whenever men
tioned. , .
Congressman Kahn was greeted with
cheers and stirred his hearers to a high
pitch of enthusiasm in advocating his
candidacy for re-election to the oflice
which he now holds. He made an elo
quent speed) on the issues which have de
veloped during the present campaign.
"Our frieuois havt raised^ a new para
mount Issue," said Mr. Kahn. "They
say that the Republican party is In favor
of abolishing for all time the exclusion
act when it expires in 1S02. This is a
baseless fabrication which the attitude it
telf of the Republican Senate and Con
gress pointedly denies. 1 am heartily in
lavor of the re-enactment of the act to
exclude yellow la&or from these shores
and If I am your representative In Con
gress I will agree to introduce another
bi'.l more stringent than the one about to
exjire. Not only Is the Republican party
unalterably against the invasion of Chi

received Its attention. I myself Intro- '

months past no Japanese have landed

"But I want to raise a. new issue here
this evening: which I hold to be the "para

A MIGHTY shout for the coming
Republican triumph from tho
brawny chest of laborâ three
ringing cheers ajid "a tiger"â
rang out over the city from
Scottish Hall last night. Statesmen have
dissipated the mist of doubt raised by
Democracy In Its cry against expansion
and financiers have pointed out thÂ« dan
gers in the path that leads to the flood
gates of free silver. But last night was
labor's night and In a mighty demonstra
tion labor made known to the people and
the world that it would stand by its ally
in the pastâ the Republican party. It
made known to the world its trust In the
Republican party to protect it from Asia's
yellow races and by Its approval gave to
tne Republican party the strength to in
sure it that protection It has found for
four years â protection in the home, pro
tection In position, protection from for
eign labor and protection from the ex
ports of foreign lands.
This, the closing demonstration, was
planned and executed by the United
League of Labor, under the direction of
Thomas B. Egan. Shortly after 8 o'clock
the many divisions of the Labor League
at Pine and Market streets.
The Bear Club, that loyal association of
Republicans, grown gray in the service
of their party, augmented by the Califor
nia veterans of the Spanish war. moved
out from headquarters on Eddy street as
an escort for the marching laborers. The
columns met at Market and Third streets,
their bands joined in the same martial air
and the march to Scottish Hall was made.
The flambeaux of the Bear Club were
extinguished, the banners and transpar
encies of the Labor League were laid
aside and the supporters of McKinley and
Roosevelt thronged the hall, which was
already well tilled with ladies and their
escorts. A monster dinner pail, full to
overflowing with sandwiches, was hoisted
to the forum, and to the cheers of the
gathering the Rough Riders' Quintet filled
their pockets as they sang of Democracy s
coming swamp. After three cheers for
McKinley and Roosevelt and three cheers
for Julius Kahn tho Bear Club retired to
look for new halls to conquer.
Ex-State Senator Maher was Introduced
as chairman of the evening. Aa a trades
manâa machinistâ he said he deprecated
loss of motion, and would, therefore, start
the wheels of information on their grind.
Senator Maher introduced Frank B. Mac
beth, candidate for the Assembly in the
Thirty-ninth District. Mr. Macbeth point
ed out the importance of districting the
city and said that undoubtedly the next
Legislature would undertake this . work.
The Republicans, he said, were fair In
their demand for a redlstrlctlng of the
city, though the reverse had been charged
â the fact that such redlstrlctlng would
give, in all probability, another Republi
can Senatorial district north of Market
street doubtless being the cause of the
Democratic complaint. This measure,
the spea.kor said, he would support and
bring ail of his Influence to bear to se
cure Us passage.
Michael B. McBride, candidate for the
Assembly in the Thirtieth District, was
Just concluding: his address to the assem
blage when Congressman Kahn entered
the hall. Mr. Kahn was greeted with
cheer after cheer. He was at once in
troduced, though, as Senator Maher re
marked, he scarcely needed Introduction,
and opened his address. In part he said:
I want in these closing hours of the cam
paign to say a few words about the paramount
issue. The Democrats In all sections of the
country raise the cry that "anti-Imperialism"
is the issue, In Colorado and other States,
where silver is the principal production, they
claim that free sliver is the issue. In New
York and other Eastern cities they cry down
Â¦vvjth the trusts and on this coast, here in Ban
Francisco, at the very end of the campaign,
they have produced a new issue and tell you
that the Republican party is in favor of ad
iriltting the vast hordes of Chinese to compete
with American labor.
I ask you how does the Republican party
stand on the question of Chinese Immigration?
Without waiting for your answer I will give
you mine. When we annexed Hawaii it was
necessary that proper Instruments for this pur
pose should be prepared and therein provision
to exclude the 20,000 Chinese then In the Islands
was Inadvertently omitted. I called the atten
tion of the chairman of the Territorial Com
mission to that fact and he informed me that
action would be taken forthwith If I would sug
gest or draw a proj>er amendment. I drew the
amendment and it was passed by the House,
by the Senate and was signed by the President.
Thus were 20,000 Chinese, lawful residents of
our own possessions, denied the right to come
to the mainland of America. Do you belleva
in view of these facts that the Republican
party is going to tear down the barriers that
to-day protect the American laborer from the
competition of Asiatics?
The Republican party Is on record as having
stood as the friend of labor in another and
similar conditionâ the immigration of Japanese
laborers. When in Washington 1 called on Sec
retary Hay and informed him of the dangers to
this coast In particular from the influx of Ja
panese laborers. He Informed me that the
wishes of Congress on this matter would meet
with his approval and as an executive officer he
would carry out any bill that might be paased
for the restriction of their Immigration. Â¦
The Jananese Minister at Â¦Washington called
upon Secretary Hay and protested against the
proposed action looking toward the exclusion
of his people and placing them on the same
plane with the Chinese. Ke was informed by
Secretary Hay, however, that II Congress so
decreed their exclusion would be enforced. The
Japanese Minister then informed hta home gov
ernment of the condition of affairs and from
this action an imperial decree was Issued pro
hibiting the emigration of laborers from Japan
to this country.
Now on my own motion I will present my
paramount issue. My issue is: Get all advan
tages possible for San Francisco and Califor
nia and exhaust all means to better the condi
tion of the people of both the city and State.
There are many bills Important to the people
of California which will come up during the
coming session of Congress. The Nicaragua
canal bill and the Hawaiian cable bill are
among- these. If It Is In my power I will see
that thÂ» cable that will lay under the sea be
tween this country and our new possessions will
be manufactured In San Francisco and thus
will some $8,000,000 be distributed among you. I
will keep a watchful eye on these bills and see
that there Is given to San Francisco what is
San Francisco's and to California that which
is hers.
Joseph Egan, a high school lad. Inter
ested the audience with a manly discus
sion of the issues and gave .way to Wil
liam R. Davis, Republican Presidential
elector. Mr. Davis expesed the attempt
of the Democratic party to make an is
sue out of the acquisition of the Philip
pines and other territory by the Repub
lican administration. "We have never
yet made an invasion of peaceful territory
for conquest," he said, ''but those lands
which have become ours by right of con
quest in righteous Â¦war will ever remain
ours that our power among the nations
of the world shall stand and grow, not
retrograde."

1118 Broadway, Nov. 3.
The Joint meeting of the. Quarter Cen
tury Republican Club, the National Re
publican League, the Army and Navy Re
publican League and the Young Men's Re
publican Lea?ue drew a big crowd to the
Republican headquarters in the Central
Bank building this evening. Representa
tive speakers, some of them gray-haired
and some young men, entertained the
audience with an arraignment of Demo
cratic fallacies and an exposition of the
high principles of the Republican party.
It was an enthusiastic crowd that listened
to these speeches, every well made point
being vigorously applauded.
J. E. Farnum. president of the National
Republican League, called the meeting to
order and Introduced Judge Charles N.
Fox. president of the Quarter Century
Club, as chairman of the evening. Judge
Fox made a brief address on national is
sues before calling upon the other speak
ers.
"As for expansion," he said, "the coun
try has been expanding for eighty yearsâ
ever since the time of Jefferson, the
greatest Democrat that ever lived. It is
not expansion that Is the question, but
whether it shall be contraction. Shall we
haul down the American flag? Expansion
came naturally and as the result of a war
for the sake of humanity. There la only
one kind of expansion that need be feared
In this country, and that is silver expan
sion. Silver expansion would paralyze the
Industries of the country and the prosper
ity we now enjoy. Bryan Is still the ex
ponent of free silver, and he always will
be."
"This is the fifteenth Presidential elec
tion that I have been Interested In," said
Dr. J. T. McLean of Alameda. "I voted
the first time In 1844. That first vote was
for H?nry Clay, the Whig candidate for
President. But Polk, the Democrat, was
elected. Democracy prevailed then. But
it will be different this time. "We are all
Republicans now. With our flag we carry
our principles. We must retain the Islands
and pive them thÂ© same freedom w"e
have."
G. R. Lukens, candidate for the State
Senate, admonished the voters present to
stand by the national and State ticket.
He said that H was imperative to elect
Republican State Senators and Assembly
men in order to insure the Legislature,
and Republican Congressmen to swell the
small Republican majority In Congress.
He did not dwell upon national Issues,
but spoke enly about the ticket.
Mayor R, W. Snow closed the meeting
saying:
"I see men .-.bout me who stood by the
cradle of the Republican party. You re
member the slogan of 1S56: 'Free soli, free
speech, free men and Fremont.' You were
wise then in the choice of your youth.
Your gray hairs are a crown of wisdom
now. Thousands of young men are
scarcely halting to make their political
choice, seeing your faces set once more
toward the capital of the nation.
"The stars of Lincoln, of Grant, of Gar
field, yes, and of Blalne, have glorified
your banners. Splashed with the blood of
successful war. crowned with the wreaths
of peace, every Republican is a hero.
What wonder that young men fall In be
hind this marching host

VOTERS URGED TO MAKE NO MISTAKES
AFTER ENTERING ELECTION BOOTHS
Republican "State Central Committee Warns
K Electors Against Pitfalls in the
Official Ballots.
' Since The Call pointed out the liability to error that lurked in the official ballot the Republican State Central Com
mittee has been busy devising ways and means to Impress even more "directly if possible upon the voters of Califor
nia the necessity of care in the marking of their ballots. To this end it has caused to be mailed broadcast the follow
ing circular letter:
, SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3, 1900.
Dear Sir: Your attention is called to the following:
The voter can only vote for NINE Presidential Electors. If the ballot is marked with more than
NINE names for Electors NONE of the names voted for can be counted or tallied, but the ballot can b*
counted only for candidates voted for Congressman, Senate, Assembly and Judges.
The voter is entitled to vote for only FOUR condidates for the long term and ONE for the unex
pired term for Superior Judges. If the ballot is marked with more than four names for the long term for
Superior Judges, then the ballot cannot be counted for any candidate for Superior Judge for the long
term: but it can be counted only for the candidates voted for for -Electors, Congressman, Senator, As
semblyman and Justices of the Peace.
To ba plain, the voter can vote for only four Judges for the long term and only one for the short
term.
A voter has the right to vote for less than nine Presidential Electors and less than four Judges
for the long term.
Watch the ballots closely. Examine them carefully before any name is called off. This will save
time and avoid mistakes. GIVE THIS CLOSE ATTENTION. Very truly yours, Â»
Secretary. \

laws on the statute books which, if enforced,
would rid us of the evil of the trusts.
Our platform has been written by the march
of events. The paramount issue was so mad*
that first and foremost in this campaign wÂ«
must insist on the preservation of the republic
and the principles on which It was founded.
v\e are engaged in a campaign in which an
appeal is made to the patriotism of the people:
the significance of the Issues may be under
stood when we recall that Democrats who four
years ago refused to follow our standard have,
for the most part, returned to their allegiance.
undeT the leadership of such men aj Ulchard
Olney and liourke Cockran. and that Republi
cans like ex-Governor Boutwell ot Massachu
setts, Senator Wellington /of Maryland and
Carl Schurz have appealed to their countrymen
to repudiate the policy of the administration
and cast their rotes for the Dcmocntle caas<>.
I would ask you to disabuse your minds of
any prejudice against our candidate. During
the last four yeara he has Ingratiated himself
Into our affections and we have come to regard
him as the very embodiment of Democratic
ideals, as the man who will be able to sava
the republic. He has been lampooned and de
nounced, but accept him as the man and as
twice the candidate of a great party, who will
save the country in its dire peril.
A few months ago in London town I ven
tured to criticize to an Englishman the course
of his country In South Africa. He said,
"Those words do not Â«It well in your mouth.
Your gcvernment is pursuing the same course
In Manila. It is tarred with the same stick."
During the Spanish war the appearance of
troops on our streets was a signal for patriotic
demonstrations. Now soldiers come and go and
we see them In silence. Why? Because wÂ»
know they are bent on a damnable mission.
Upon the acquisition of the Philippines new
problems arose and it is for the blundsrin?
solutions of these by the President that wÂ»
oppose him. He decided to enter upon a policy
of Imperialism, and on this the American peo
ple must sit as a Jury.
The President has decided and th9 Republi
can party Is eupporting him, that the Monroe
doctrine is a relic of the past and that this
country may make foreign alliances and acquire
territory in the Eastern hemisphere; that the
Philippine people are not of right nor ought
to be free and independent: that th* territory
acquired shall not b* carved into States, but
that It shall be maintained as a vassal depend
ency, governed in the interests of this country.
which Is the beginning of a colonial policy an4
the establishment of an empire. This radical
departure we hold in common with patriotic
men like Schnrz. Reed. Edmunds and Hoar
is untenable morally, and in the light of thÂ«
constitution and the law: that it is at ones
both wrong and inexpedient, and that no possi
ble advantage, either of glory nor commerce,
can accrue by it to the United States.
Tht^ chapter, which Is beln< written In blood,
is the most shameful In our history, and in th*
verdict of the future William McKlnley wlli
be found guilty of high crimes and misde
meanors.
Every one under the flag Is a citizen an4
when we acquire foreign territory every resi
dent of that territory becomes a citizen an<i
the guarantees of the constitution apply to him.
The President of the United States entered
into * solemn agreement with the Sultan of
Eulu to protect his institutions of polygamy,
slavery and despotism. We have heard of tho
twin relics of barbarism, but these are the
triplets of tyranny. What a shameful specta
cle, for President McKinley to wed the goddess
of liberty to the Sultan of Sulu. It is almost
as bad as the British alliance.
Remember that up to this point our foreign
policy is only the President's policy. th* Fili
pino war Is only tha President's war. lie has
usurped the powers of Congress. He has
pursued misguided Judgment. He has made a
terrible mistake. This is the first opportunity
the people have had to speak. A grave duty is
upon them. By emphatically condemning a
policy of usurpation and shame, by repudiating
an administration, which has set at naught
the principles which have given us freedom
and made us as a nation what we are you
will have remedied, as far as you are able,
the wrong which has been d*neâ the wrong to
yourselves and to your countryâ Â«md preserved
at a crisis in its history the republic of YCash
lngton. If you fall In this duty you will rue
Ivm^S; Jni y K U ""I* 1 "* Perform it another
e\idence will be given to the world of tho
power, the Intelligence and the patriotism of
the American people.
MAYOR PHELAN was the
principal speaker at tho
Democratic rally at Metro
politan Temple last night.
For over two hours
San Francisco's imperialistic executive
denounced imperialism and reviled Presi
dent McKinley, accusing him of high
crimes and misdemeanors and asserting
that he was directly and personally re
sponsible for the death of 2500 soldier boys
in the Philippines. He made the Presi
dent out to be the very worst bogle man
that was ever conjured up, worse even
than Mark Hanna.
The audience could not have been great
er within the limits of Metropolitan Tem
ple, and the crowd was entirely a Phelan
crowd. It gave the Mayor a most flatter
ing reception when he began to talk, and
it cheered wildly his most rabid utter
ances. If he forgot to criticize policies in
order to assail the President personally,
they hurraher. When he asserted that
November 6 was the Judgment day that
would bring rebuke to the administration,
they applauded as vociferously as if they
had really believed it.
Senator J. C. Sims, chairman of the
State Central Committee, called the meet
ing to order and Introduced Supervisor
Joseph Tobin as chairman of the evening.
Mr. Tobln had some sensational things to
say himself. Some of them were these:
We are here to rebuke the Dolicy of ruffian
ism, the policy of murdering one-half of tha in
habitants of the Philippines In order to civil
ize the other half. We are here to do what
William McKinley promised to do when he took,
the oath of office and swore to uphold the con
stitution of the United States. The constitution
has become a by-word In the army of the
United States. Officers who serve under Its
authority have come to scoff and sneer at it.
I have heard General Merrltt here In San Fran
cisco refer to It as an "outsrrown garment, as
a mere string: of platitudes."'
We are here for high purposes, because we
place the man before the dollar. The Repub
lican party prophesies that the Pacific Coast
will give a Republican majority because we are
â¢ fed fat on the spoils of war. We are here to
reflect on the price we have paid for these ani
mal delishts.
J. H. Henry, candidate for Congressman
from the Fifth District, spoke briefly, out
lining his views on the tariff, monetary,
labor, immigration and other questions.
He asserted that the war against the Fili
pino insurgents was being waged at the
instance of the trusts under the lead of
Mark Hanna. H_e believes In a protective
tariff, and thinks the party does, but it
must be levied for the benefit of the many
and not for the few.
Chairman Tobin desired to say a word
in honor of a man who. breaking away
from influences as strong as steel, "has
come out strong for what he conceives to
be the rightâMr. John J, Valentine."
That Is the way he said it. He /aid more
about Mr. Valentine, and the audience
cheered frantically.
Mayer Phelan spoke In part as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen: After an absence of
about a. year from this hall It gives ma great
pleasure to return to discuss national Issues.
I ventured a prophecy a few weeks ago that
California would cast its electoral vote for Wil
liam J. Bryan. The chairman of the Republi
can State Central Committee offered to wager
$100,000 that It would not be so cast. We put
men against dollars, and do not take the risk
of losing our votes through a violation of the
law.
The flippancy of the press and the usual atti
tude of the people Is out of placa In this cam
paign, the object of which is to re-establish
the republic on its ancient foundation.
The Republican party has constructed its
platform not to stand on. but to get In on. I
hav<Â» found bucollo orators assert that the Re
publican party Is opposed to trusts. *WÂ» have
X""*^ XTTZENS of the Forty-first Ab
m sembly District, irrespective of
1 â¢ Â» party, should make special effort
|J X In this campaign to place Dibble
on the shelf until he reforms. He
never goes to Sacramento without get
ting mixed up in some sort of legislative
scandal that reflects discredit on the
Forty-first District and injures the Re
publican party. He has never been a rep
resentative of the people. He belongs to
the Southern Pacific In making returns
for assessment to the State Board of
Equalization the company does not in
clude him in its franchises or rolling
rtock, but he is the property of the cor
poration all the same and ought to be
taxed as Euch.
Republicans should bear in mind that
Dibble has no right to claim the paxty
rorair.ation. If the Supreme Court had
rot overthrown the primary election ho
would have been beaten out of sight.
This fact Is well known to the taxpayers
and property owners of the Forty-first.
"When the protection of law was removed
and Democrats were permitted to vote at
the open primary Dibble with the assist
ance of Kelly. Crlmmius and Rainey se
cured a delegation favorable to his nom
ination. He counts on the popularity of
the national Republican ticket to pull
him through next Tuesday. He knows
that the foremost Republicans of the dis
trict are opposing him, but he relies on
getting: 60 per cent of the Republican
party vote.
If the Republicans of the district will
take time to fairly review DibDle's past
and present affiliations with the bosses,
his scandalous conduct in the Legisla
ture, his attitude toward General w. H.
L. Barnes and Irving M. Scott In the long
Senatorial contest, they will place him
on the shelf next Tuesday. He refused
to give General Barnes or Mr. Scott the
simple compliment of a single vote. In
explanation of his refusal he declared
time and again that the citizens of the
Fortv-tlrst had expressed a preference
for Dan Burns and he was loud in utter
ing: the cry, "Burns or no Senator." The
welfare of the Republican party was
nothing- to him then, but now he is pro
fessing: loyalty to tha party and appeal
ing: to Republicans for support. He la
beginning to think that the bosses can
not save him from defeat.'

that, while it is a bit too early to forecast Accurately, the indica
tions are favorable to a smiling Tuesday. The records show that
in the past twenty-nine years the average number of rainy days
in November has been seven. The greatest number of such
days in the month of record in any' one year was twenty-one,
in 1885, while in 1890 there was no rain on any day in November.
There were no indications of rain last evening.

' SUITS TO BE BROUGHT
FOB DELINQUENT TAXES
Unpaid Difference in Rate of 1897
Will Result in Many, Heavy
Penalties.
Frank P. Haynes, collector of delin-
quent taxes under Tax Collector Scott, Is
about to begin suits against some 30,000
property holders who are delinquent on
their personal property taxes for the year
1838. This delinquency in many cases is
for a small amount only and represents
the difference between the amount col
lected by the Assessor based en the rate
of the previous year and the rate fixed
by the Board of Supervisors In June, 1898.
In some cases the- amount due is only i
cepts and seldom does It reach the sum
of,$l, but a large number of people will
be obliged to pay In addition to the taxea
due the penalties provided by the Polit
ical Code. These penalties include the
costs of suit, attorneys' fees and notary
public fees, which amount In every in
stance to over $2.
Tax Collector Scott pronounces the law
on the subject an outrage.
"It is about aa unjust a piece of legls
latlon as can be found on our statute
books," said Scott yesterday, "une per
sonal property holder in mos<. instances
.has paid his taxes according to the rate
of the previous fiscal year. In 1S9S the
Supervisors levied a higher tax rate and
the difference became due the city. Many
of these taxpayers know nothing abou*
the increased tax rate of that year
probably never having been notified to
that effect. Now comes the law which
Imposes heavy penalties on those who
have not paid the difference, slight as it
may be. The charter does not permit mo
to cellect the difference, as it places the
full power of collection with the delin
quent tax collector, whom, however, I ap
point. While the taxes due will not
amount to much more than $20,000 the
penalties will aggregate over $50,000."
change on the business transacted on the
floor of that organization during- the
month of October shows that In all 420,700

$51,383 25. Of the total 163,950- shares were
of listed stock and 201.750 of ur...sted. Tho

The storm last Monday did considerable
damage in the Summerla*nd field.. The
next morning broken derricks cumbered
the earth. The Star Company, the Sum
merland Oil and Development Company
and the Woman's Pacific Coast Company
all lost their drilling derricks. Of pump
ing rigs the Newman and the Marine
were- the sufferers, the first named losing
one and the latter two. The wind was
fortunately from the north and off tho
land, In consequence of which the
swharves escaped damage. ~ : J T~ >
* The sinking of wells at Summerland
will go on for some time to come, accord
ing to the present indications. The Sun
set Oil Company has in view five new
wells for the immediate future, which will
average from 600 to 600 feet in depth.
They will be distant from the shore Una
about 500 feet. The Marine and Santa
Barbara Oil companies also give indica
tions of an Intention to expand, "each of
them having had new wharves construct
ed for the promotion of their operations.
Seepages of oil have been discovered m
the Sespe Canyon, Fillmore district, in
pools from two to fifteen feet wide and
from six inches to two feet deep in places..
The district begins about eight miles
north of Fillmore and is of considerable
extent
The Reed Crude Oil Company, in â¢ tho
Kern River district, will have thirty pro
ducing wells pumping In the near future.
Twelve are pumping now and the dally
shipments are from four to six carloads.
The company Is providing a 20,000 barrei
tank and is laying a pipe line.
The Southern Pacific Company -is ex
tending its track in the Mclvlttnck fields
from a point near the old station to tile
Kern River wells. About half the grading
Is done.
The Wilson Oil Company of Los Ange â¢
les has leased a quarter of the southwest
quarter of section 4, 9, 2S, In the Kern
River district and the figures, as reported
are interesting. The lease extends over
a period of twenty years. The royalty Is
37^4 per cent. Derricks must be erected
In twenty days, rigs must be operating in
forty days and a well completed in ninety
days.
The California Petroleum Miners' Asso
ciation has adopted a resolution authoriz
ing President L. P. Crane to appoint
agents in the East "to promote the best
Interests of the members of this associa
tion in the disposition of capital stock."
The association will hold an open session
on the third Thursday of each month for
the discussion of topics relating to tha
oil Industry.
The London Petroleum Industrial and
Technical Review furnishes an account of
the 10,000-mile voyage of the 3teamer Cow
rie, burning petroleum fuel, between Bor
neo and England. She made greater
speed under oil fuel than she had pre
viously made with the, use of coal. She
burned twenty-six tons of liquid fuel per
day as against a former consumption
dally of thirty-two tons of Welsh coal.
The vessel is used for transporting oil
from Borneo and carrying back a general
cargo.
The Desert Oil Company at Indio is
ready to drill, having its derrick and ma
chinery there. The hills will be prospect
ed for oil.
The Los Angeles Herald has the follow
ing concerning the Plru district:
The Piru oil district Is one long established,
and yet with the exception of the two or three
companies which have been operating here
for several years, no strikes to speak of are
being made. Various reasons are given for the
failure of numerous companies which have
and are etlll trying to strike it. but tho ab
sence of oil is not srlven as one of them, be
cause oil is there, and every hillside and can
yon proves it. And It is on account of these
numberless evidences of oil deposits that men
are induced to place their money in the dis
trict. The territory is very treacherous, how
ever, and tho strata are broken and twisted in
a frightful fashion and give evidence of an
exceedingly mixed up state of affairs a million
or more years ago, when these hills were form
ed. But the oil is there somewhere. If a com
pany strikes oil It has demonstrated that oil
is to be found in that particular spot, but
demonstrates nothing else. A company is sure
It has oil lands when it has proven it by strik
ing oil and not until then. It must be ac
knowltdffcd withal that large capital and large
experience are Important factors in getting oil
in the Plru district, the same as in every other
field, and the companies which possess these
requirements arc of course the most success
ful in their work. There are practically but
thrte producing companies In the district and
they have been very fortunate in their opera
tions and are working their claims for all
there Is In them. /.
The Monticello Oil Company, which has
been organized at Monticello. havine its
principal place of business at Napa City,
will develop oil In the Berryessa Valley,
where 5000 acres have been secured. Jo
seph W. Harris has leased to T. A. and
H. T. Flnnell 1559 acres in Berryessa Val
ley. The oil fever is taking hold there. In
the Harris lease it is provided that Har
ris shall receive one-twelfth of the min
eral output, oil, gas, coal, etc.
About 70 per cent of the oil Toduct of
Kern River district has been signed to
the Producers' Oil Storage and Trans
portation Company. The per cent is still
greater in the other districts of the coun
ty. Â¦ The holders of land In the proven
portion of Kern River district could make
all kinds of leases now if they willed.
Every day brings men here seeking such.
Some Fresno parties recently obtained
one of thirty acres on 4, 29, 28, agreeing
to pay 50 per cent royalty. Â¦ Â«;Â¦â¢..,
The most promising part of the north
west extension of the Los Angeles oil
field is reported to be about three miles
northwest from the. Baptist College
grounds. A company controls. fifteen acres

CHICAGO, Nov. 8.â The wheat market tu
inactive throughout the session, the. dealers as

evenly balanced against developments during
the Sunday rest. Operations by scalpers
formed most of the business, but Â¦ there' wo*
some buying by the Northwest rrom local In
terests bearlshly Inclined. December opened a
shade lower at 73*i M 73VAc because of the ex
cellent weather and a decline at Liverpool,
which, however, was- only equal to the drop
here yesteoday. At the' start the market
touched 73%"3 73'.4c, but eased off again to 73',-ic.
At this point shortB were moved to cover their

exportable surplus from the coming -crop ut
4S.000.000 bushels, or 27,000,000 bushels lesa than
the surplus of the crop at present moving.
December advanced to 78%c and closed . firm

XEVT YOPJC. Nov. 3.â The attention of Stock
Exchange brokers waÂ» largely diverted to the
political para/Se to-day and trading was almost
er.tlrcly confined to th* closing up of contracts
over Sunday, or until after election. The
bears were disposed to cover evidently, as
prices moved upward for thÂ« mcrt part. In
rpired statements regarding the heavy earnings

contract in South Africa had been secured by
the rress Steel Company helped the latter

In the call loan market, aa it waa attributed
In part to manipulation. The conditions which
made the manipulation effective are felt to be
temporary and the quick weakening of sterling

The previous high record for the etoek was
Â£00. Last week'* rapid speculative Kalt has
not been continued thin week and the volume
of dealings has fallen off to near tbe point of
midsummer dullness. There Is a disposition in
Wall etreet to attribute thiÂ» to a Judlcioua
curbing proo#*s by what are called the "con

are deeply committed to speculative ventures.
This is â¢Â» far true that the Inordinate manipu

havÂ« fiecaniJfJ additional cash margins from
their client* to hold stocks over the election,
thus forcing tome speculative holdings upon
the market. Some observers have attributed
these measure* to an altruistic spirit on ihÂ«
part of the controlling interests or at least to 1
a commendable eelf-r*Â«traint about tailng all \
the good things in sight. But additional mo- |
tlveÂ« may be discerned, the foremost being the
possibility of pitfalls In the rutura for Â«uch !
a headlong- speculative gait as that pursued i
last weak and previous to that time. The
ispecnlatloo has been based on the assumption I
that a large demand for stocks will spring up
after the election on the part of the public at
larsÂ«. Ta,Â« Industry expended In getting prlcej
to a highrr level has been Intended to ac
commodate this expected outside demand. But
It became evident last week that the outside
public, with a degree of sophistication for
which professional Wall street does not always
give It credit, was Itself discounting the ex
pected heavy buying of stocks. This develop
ment threatened the future In two ways. It
curtailed the requirements to be left unfilled
until after election and It added to the volurat
of long stock which wculd be thrown upon
the market to realize at that time. The
"controlling Interests," therefore, sold large
amounts of stocks to feed this anticipatory
demand and called a halt to the rapid ad
vance In prices, which had been the means
of attracting It. The advance In the money
rate during the latter part of the week shows
the wisdom of the precautionary measures
adopted. Had tbÂ«re bÂ«en much larger amounts
borrowed for speculation the disturbance of
money rates would have been, more severe and
the forcing of liquidation on a much larger
scsJe. The stiffening of the call loan rate Is
attributed to the exigencies of the monthly
e*ttlement and It Is hoped that with the re
distribution of the amounts thus borrowed In
the form of dividends and Interests there will
be a returning ease of money next week. Need
less to ear the "controlling interests" also
hope tsere will be a renewal of speculative
demand for stocks with the easier money mar
ket. Oa the side of the promised e&ee of money
are the further amounts of imported gold which ;
arf still to be recel\*e<I ajid counted In bank :
rÂ» nerves. TbcaÂ« include another consignment
of over t3.O0O.O00 Jn transit from Australia, j
There are larger hums of Alaskan gold also in
sight.
Business In bonds has been on a declining
s?aJe and laj-rely concentrated in a few mort-
Kajres of speculative value*. Prices have re
ceded.

NEW JOUK, Not. 3. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market here was extremely quiet
to-day. Prices were Irregular In their move
ments. The American department was as sMll
as the rest of the list. Everybody Is waiting
for the election. Prices of American shares
were above parity. Southern Pacific Issue*
were again the main feature, but tin closed
below the hlgheet for the day. few dealers
waiting for the opening in Wall street. Money
was eaaier. Call money, l*44f2H Per cent, waa
unlendable at the close.
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â The Financier eays:
The New York bank statement for the week
ending November 3 does not come up to pre
liminary ' expectations, although as a matter
of fact it is not to be regarded as unfavorable.
Instead of a sain in cash the banks show a
loss of $485,500 in reserve, but this was prac
tically offset by the release of funds through
; the shrinkage In deposits. The contraction in
loans, amounting to $1.0f4.300, is a moderate re
flection of the week a operations. The heavy
changes reported by one large bank make a
general analysis of the statement Difficult. The
excess reserve now amounts to $5,950,400. The
principal feature of interest, however, in the
monetary situation Is the cessation of the rea
son's flow of funds to the South and West.
It Is known that there was an actual reversal
of the movement last week, several of the
New York banks having received remittances
from these sections. The crop requirements
this fall have taken more money out of the
clearing-house Institution! than at any pre
vious period. The lofs has been offset in a
measure by the receipts of six millions in gold
from Europe.

DECIDUOUS FRUIT&â ,
Supplies of Oranges continue to Increase and
prices are consequently declining. Lemons and
Limes continue weak and In heavy supply. The
Panama steamer brought up 621 cases Mexi
can Limes.
Grapes are getting scarce and prices are Im
proving In consequence.
A few days more will probably seÂ« the laat
of Melons.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Ebbts are quoted very weak and some dealers j
do not quote over 40c for the very best. Still
lower prices are expected. Receipts are larger
and stocks are accumulating, though they are
not very heavy as yet.
Butter Is also In heavy supply and weak,
though since the market went down Los Ange
les and other points have begun to order, and
this leads dealers to hope that the bottom has
been touched.
Ther* Is no change In Ch*se.

In Louisiana, if a creditor finds that his
debtor Intends to leave the State and stay
away he can, without further botnerlng,
get out an attachment and seize whatever
property the unfortunate may have, says
the Chicago Journal.
/A creditor, who was one. of Colonel
Proudfoofs .clients, performed this oper
ation one morning and the debtor was
so hurt about It- that he fell dead. The
debtor's heirs went to law later .and
claimed the property on the grounds that
the death made the seizure invalid.
."The law in this case, gentlemen. Is
very clear," said the colonel, when hisÂ»
chance came. "It says that if a man ia
about. to leave the State permanently hit
property may be seized. If our late la
