to mount the pony it shied across the

One mischievous Intent of the corre

his argument being that the President's

Admiral Bradford, chief, of the Bureau
of and . Supplies In, the Navy
Department, has a bulletin hanging in his
room which shows the exact amount of
coal available for the United States navy
in different parts of the earth. Bradford
is: a great provider. Before the Spanish
war he bought up every ton of coal ashoro
or 'afloat, that he could find available 'for
fleets,. andyUns^e Sam had coal piles scat
tered from one end of Christendom to the
other.. Coal isc6ntraband of war and
neutral nations are . not : allowed to sell it
to combatants.' Having this in mind. Ad

hostilities actually -commenced, and had
enough on hand to last the navy as long
as Spain could have kept up the fighting.
Believing it to be a good thing to have a
supply, of fuel: available In distant port*
where coal Is difficult to obtain,, Admiral
Bradford has kept all his coal yards and
intends'to keep them permanently, re
plenishing the supply from our own mines
as rapidly as necessary, and thus emanci
pating, the navy;from dependence â¢ upon
the coal dealers of Europe and the differ

Allen tells many funny stories about
himself. One of his funniest experiences,
he says, happened at the Ponce dc Leon
Hotel In Florida. Ten years ago he vla
uted this famous resort and, after regis
tering, was shown to a suite of rooms on
the parlor floor.
"When the bellboy disappeared." Mr.
Allen says, "I looked around and it struck
me at first that. I had bumped up against
a pretty good thing. Why. do you know,
the carpets on those floors must have been
of real velvet and about six Inches thick.
They had silver-mounted hair brushed
and combs and fancy fixings till you
couldn't dress, and the sizq of that room
was about the same as the corner lot that
we used to play town ball on when I was
a boy. Now, I ain't a very nch man, and
when I got to thinking about it. I began
to get scared ,
"'John, old man, I said to myself,
'you'd better investigate this tÂ»ing before
you go any further. So I sneaked down
to the barroom and laying 15 cents on
the bar, asked for a drink of whisky.
The bartender gave me the whisky all
right, but he said it was 30 cents. I
paid it and, going over to the cigar coun
ter, I hauled out a nickel and asked for
a cigar. The young man told me that he
didn't keep anything less than twenty
flve-centers. Then 1 sfeppecT back to my
room and rang for a bellboy. When he
came up I gave him a half-dollar and
said: 'Son, don't say- anything to any
body, but just go down and rubber around
a little and find out how much they
charge a day for these rooms.' You see,
I was getting uneasy. That boy came
back In about tent minutes and toJd me
that rooms were. only worth HO a day.
a "That being pretty nearly all the money
I had with me, I saw I had to do some
thing pretty quick.. I just grabbed my
valise and headed for the counter: When
I got there I looked very serious and told
the clerk that I had just discovered that
it was absolutely necessary for me to be

PORT ANGELES, Wash.. Dec 25.â
Three vessels which felt the fury of the
recent storm are in the harbor. The ship
Yosemite looks as though a cyclone had
struck her, her upper works being almost
demolished. The German ship Carl
reached here this morning in bad shape.
She left Tacoma four weeks ago laden
witlr-wheat. She was compelled to throw
overboard fifty fons of wheat. She is leak
ing badly. The Highland Light, laden with
coal, was bound for San Francisco. The
storm handled her roughly. She is leak
ing badly and will probably be unloaded
here. The captains of all the ships are old
men who have followed the sea all their
lives, and each of them states the recent
storm off the Pacific coast was the worst
they ever encountered In any waters.

Marquette founded in 1671. Father Jacker
found the ruins of the chapel, and dig

has just made a second trip down tho
canyon of the Merced River twenty miles
from Yosemite Valley, where a cable
bridge and foot trail are being construct
ed to aid the mail system and the public.
The major reports that the bridge Is com
pleted and in a short time the trail will
also be finished. He says that his two
forest rangers, Charles Leidig and Archi
bald Leonard, have been doing excellent
work> in the park this winter.
In previous years so soon as the troop
left the park in November for the Pre
sidio, eportsmen from all the surrounding
country would pour into the park and
make a general slaughter of the game.
The soldiers only protected the game in
the summer for the hunters to kill by the
wholesale In the winter. The Government
only .provides two forest rangers to guard
the park during the winter months and it
is not possible for them to do justice to
such a large area of land. It is easv for
the hunters to ascertain their where
abouts and avoid them. This season the
major announced his 'intention of making
trips into the park throughout the winter.
This is the first time any superintendent
has ever done this, and it has had thede-'
sired effectâ to intimidate the hunters^-so

KNEW HIS BUSINESS.
Knew Something Besides What He
Bead in Books.
The wise, up-to-date, modern doctor is
no longer tied down to tho hard and fast
rules of what his medical books say he
shall use and what he may withhold in
treating his patient.
The successful doctor nowadays is tha
one who is quick to avail himself of any
remedy, new or old, which holds out a
chance of cure no matter whether it 13
Allopathic, Homeopathic or neither one.
Dr. Jennison. in an interesting article
on ttjdigestltlon and dyspepsia says:
"Nine-tenths of all people, who apply to
me for advice and treatment think they
have this ailment or that ailment, but I
find on close examination that their whole-
trouble arises from poor digestion.
They have little appetite, and if they
do have an appetite, the food they eat
does them no good. Why? Because It Is
but half digested, causing thin blood,
weak nervea. sleeplessness, aching: bones,
pains in chest, formation of gases, belch-
ing, etc. They tell me they believe they
have consumption, or heart disease, rheu-
matism, nervous prostration, in fact most
every disease but the right one.
In -reality, the whole trouble is in, the
stomach and nowhere else. Now what do
I do with such people? I don't feed, them
on prerdigested foods like babies, nor
"stomach bitters." nor patent nostrums
which I know nothing about. No honor-
able physician will prescribe a remedy
unless he knows what it contains and its
probable effects.
For all such patients I have but one
prescription. I advise them to gro to the
nearest drug store and get a 50-cent box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I use them
with remarkable success in all cases of
indigestion arfd stomach trouble, because
I know what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
consist of and what they win do. They
contain the vegetable essences, diastase
and government test pepsin, which are tha
things every weak stomach lacks to re-
store natural digestive vigor, and if I
had dyspepsia myself it is the one remedy
I should take.
When a patient comes to me complain-
ing of dull headaches, sour stomach, bad
taste, nervousness, belching of gas. or
heart trouble, which is generally caused
from indigestion. I tell him to take one or
two of Stuart's Tablets after each meal
and as often during the day as he has
any trouble, and I feel confident I nave
given that patient the best advice I could
give."
< Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet* are large,
pleasant* tasting lozenges, containing dias-
tase and pepsin, combined with fruit and
vegetable essences. They are not cathar-
tic and do not act on any particular organ
like ordinary drugs, but simply act en-
tirely on the food eaten. They are a nat-
ural digestive, pure and simple. Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents per package through-
out the United States, Canada and Great
Britain. .

Comparing this showing with the volume
of business on hand in the early summer
of 1899 we find a distinct gam of $7,000,009
in the value of contracts, inasmuch as the
commissions in the hands of the builders
at that time amounted to approximately
$62,000,000. That the growth of the industry
Is. moreover, even greater than evidenced
by these figures may bo appreciated by -a
comparison of the sundry items which go
to make up each total. It will thus be
peen that whereas the volume of naval
work fell off $8,000,000, without taking into
consideration the Russian contract, the
value of the shipbuilding on the inland
rivers was almost double, the aggregate
of contracts of the Great Laikes yards wa3
more than trebled and the plants on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts showman in
crease of man}' per cent In the commis
sions on their* books. â Engineering Maga
zine. . *
The contracts in the hands of the Amer
ican shipbuilders afford an equally satis
factory showing. There are now building
or under contract in the shipyards of tho
United States mercantile and naval ton
nage which represents an aggregate value,
exclusive of the armor and armament for
the naval vessels, of $69,000,000. Of this
total the naval vessels building for the
United States Navy Department foot up
in round numbers $34,50'),000; the two Rus
sian war vessels building at the yard of
"William Cramp & Sons Company, $5,000,
000: the mercantile vessels on the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts, $1S,000,000; the mercan
tile vessels on the Great Lakes, $10,000,000,
and the mercantile craft on the inland
rivers. 51.500.000.
That the shipyards of the country are In
a generally prosperous condition is indi
cated by the fact that during the last six
months of 1839 and the first four months
of 1900 there was only one failure among
firms operating plants of any magnitude.
On the other hand a number of shipbuild
ing establishments which had been closed
for some time were reopened, and there
was scarcely one of the more prominent
institutions which did not inaugurate en
largements or improvements, these-exten
sions amounting in some instances to a
virtual doubling of the capacity of the
yard. Most significant of all is the fact
that in the interval mentioned there were
projected ten new shipbuilding corpora
tions, which propose to erect plants en
tailing outlays ranging all the way from
$500,000 to $6,000,000. Some of these new
projects are already well advanced, and
if all are carried out on the lines made

FOR THE POOR
PUEBLO, "Colo., Dec. 25.â ThÂ« police
have failed thus far to unearth any clew
to the whereabouts of Maggie Hoel, tho
young lady who mysteriously disappeared
three days ago from her uncle's home,
near the city. The impression is growing
that she left of her own accord. One the
ory, is that the girl fled to avoid fulfilling
her marriage engagement, which was set
for two Â¦ or three months ahead. Another
is that she has fallen into the hands of
the proprietress of some bad house. In
either case, however, it does not seem
that Maggie. would have gone without
either her hat or wraps. . â¢
There is a probability that the unknown
and well-dressed woman who was in that
vicinity in a coach drawn by white horses
on the morning previous to. her disappear
ance had 'some connection with the mys
tery, though the strange woman gave a
sharp and , repelling reply to Miss Hoel
when" the girl Inquired if she could assist
her. The house is in an isolated place in
the river bottoms, surrounded by thickets,
and the presence there of a fine coach and
richly dressed woman is something very
unusual. : -

of an unknown man was found
hanging to a tree near the town
of Crocket't, In Contra Costa
County. From a description
telegraphed here from San Quentin it is
believed the suicide is C. J. Walden. the
missing accountant of the Jute mill at the
prison. There were no papers on the
clothing by which tho man could be
identified. In his pockets were found an
empty purse and a pipe.
Coroner Curry at once started for the
place and cut aewn the body. He notified
Walden's relatives, but will not hold an
inquest until he hears from them.

SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 25.â The prison of
ficials at San Quentin can hardly believe
that the body 'found in Contra Costa
County is that of C. J. Walden. the miss
ing accountant at the prison. The descrip
tion sent by them this afternoon does not
exactly tally with that of Walden. No
cause that would lead the missing man
to suicide can be found at the prison. His
position was strictly a clerical one and
no money or its equivalent ever passed
through his hands. Up to the time he lert
the prison on his week's vacation, he was
contented and cheerful, and gave not the
slightest evidence of trouble of any kind.
He was a splendid marksman and every
Sunday found him at Schuetzen Park,
competing In the several clubs of which
he was a member. At the prison he was
a valuable and highly esteemed man. As
an accountant he had few equals. It Is
said that it will take several men to do

For weeks the experimenters worked to
ascertain what- qualities salt possessed to
cause this rhythmic beating of the heart
that were not possessed by calcium or
potassium, the salts of which enter into
the composition of the blood. They found
a solution of the problem in the fact that
the action of sodium chloride was due to
the peculiar character of the sodium. In
making the Investigation they - discovered
that .pure sodium chloride solution was
destructive of heart tissues, and by mix
ing calcium and potassium solutions with
the sodium solutions they found that the
poisonous effects of the chloride were de
stroyed. . Â¦ â¢
Dr. Loeb and -Professor Lingle claim
that the fallacy of the early belief that
the heart beats because it. is full of blood
was quickly shown when a strip of the
turtle's heart was suspended in a solution
of sodium chloride and a regular series of
beats began. I Separated from all j nerve
connections, the lifeless strip of heart

ence of the salty solution.

"When' Clark saw him he nearly
fainted, but he managed to get him into
the private office. 'Wnere's that money?'
he demanded; without any preface. 'What
money?' â¢ asked the Colonel, Â¦ in genuine
amazement. 'Good God!' - gasped poor
Clark, 'the money for that draft!' TVny,
I left It for you in an envelope,', replied
the r Colonel: 'I gave it to old John the
night I went Â¦ away.' Old 'John â¢ was i the
porter. They called him In: He was
nearly eighty, half childish, and honest as
the day is long. When they fired a volley
of frantic questions at him he - instantly
became bewildered. ; That envelope! that
envelope!' ; he : repeated, scratching his
head; 'it seems to me I remember some
thing about an envelope! Oh yes!' he ex
claimed, brightening up. 'I believe I slipped
it under, Mr. Clark's table cover and for
got, to mention It. I hope It wasn't any
thing important-' Clark s writing table
-had ; an old Â¦ baize cover that hadn't been
removed ; in a generation. " He - ripped It
off , with one Â¦ wild * snatch ; and there lay
"He kept that up for nve years. Ex
actly how he did it is of no special im
portance. It was a small hank and he
had complete run of its affairs, so the
mere mechanism of making false entries
and carrying fictitious balances over from
day to day was comparatively easy; but
the frightful part of It was the mental
strain Â¦ and knowledge that some slight
Blip might at any moment lead to dis
covery. Of course he made desperate ef
forts to save and his , meanness became
proverbial, but fate seemed to be against
him and he was never able to acrape to
gether enough to make an appreciable re
duction'ln the amount. Moreover, he was
handicapped at the start by~his tnvest
ment in the gas deal, which ' of Â¦ course
went to pieces when Patterson, levanted.
But perhaps Â¦-, the worst: feature" of . the
affair was the change it made in his dis
position. He was ; originally ' a kindly,
even-tempered man/ but incessant worry
and brooding soured his whole nature,
and, I think, estranged him more or less
in even his ovm household. In brief, he
was on the verge of mental and physical
collapse, .when who should- walk Into th*
bank one day but Colonel Patterson him
self, as cherry and chipper as. ever.
"I will leave you to imagine Clark's
feelings," the old detective went on. "The
thing was so incredible that at first he
couldn't believe It; otherwise he should
probably have made a clean breast of the
draft affair at once. But he was confident
that the colonel would turn up and ex
plain everything, and so he concealed the
shortage from day to day, until It was
past all explaining. Strange to say, no
body else had suffered through Patter
son's abrupt departure, but everything
had proved to be Involved up to the hilt,
and he left nothing behind worth taking.
With that it dawned upon Clark that he
was stuck irrevocably for the $7000 deficit
on the draft, and then began a season of
martyrdom that must have been Infinite
ly worse than death. Had it not been for
his family* I am satisfied he would have
taken a short cut out of the dilemma by
putting a bullet through . his brains, but
he couldn't stand the idea of leaving them
to pauperism and disgrace, and, like
many another man In desperate straits,
he started In upon a systematic course of
concealment. Â¦ hoping against hope that
some miracle would happen to enable him
to make good the shortage. - -
- About two weeks later Patterson came
to the bank in i a- tremendous rush and
asked for a statement of his account. Like
all speculators he sometimes had a very
large balance and sometimes nearly noth
ing, and - on that particular occasion it
was less than a thousand. "The deuce!"
he said, "I'm going out of town this even
ing and I'll have a sight draft coming in
to-morrow for JSOOO that simply must be
protected." In five minutes he convinved
poor Clark that he would positively have
the cash there the following day, and, to
make a long story short, the cashier
quickly paid the draft and made a private
ticket for the amount. Patterson didn't
return, and in a week- his disappearance
was the sensation of the town.
The way Note Teller Alvord covered up
his stealings from day to day reminded an
old railroad detective of a little story. "I
found out about this case t'other end to,"
he said; "getting on to the wind-up first,
then the middle part, and then the begin
ning; but I'll tell it to you in the order
that it happened. Back in 'So or '86. when
I was working for a St. Louis agency, a
very decent kind of a man â call him Mr.
Clark for shortâ was cashier of the prin
cipal bank in a good-sized near-by town.
Country cashiers get mighty small pay,
and although Clark had been in service
almost from boyhood and was then mid
dle-aged, with a big family on his hands,
he was drawing $1800 a year. Naturally
he was very anxious to lay by something
for a rainy day. One of the customers of
the bank at that time was a Colonel Pat
teVson, manager of the local opera-house,
president of two or three land companies,
and an all-around hustler and good fel
low. Patterson had been in town only a
few years, but he waa one of those men
who will drop Into a small, sleepy place
and take the community by storm. He
was a big, jovial chap of the silk-hat and
solitaire shirt-stud type, and it was gen
erally supposed that he. had oodles of
money. Clark, who" was a' shy. Simple
minded man, admired him immensely and
went out of his way to do' him small fa
vors. In return the colonel took him
aside one day and offered to let him in on
a St. Louis gas stock deal that promised
to be a big thing. Clark mortgaged his
house, raised a few hundred, gave his
note for a few hundred more, and went in.

features of Christmas day In New York
City and Its /vicinity -was the weather.
Not only wai the sky clear In all direc
tions, save to the southwest, where heavy
clouds acted as a background to the glo
rious sunshine, but the rays of the sun
after 7 o'clock in the morning were genial
and heavy -wraijs -cere uncomfortable and
furs codd not be endured, except as fash
ion dictated that they are the proper
thing at this season of the year. In con
sequence- of this almost springlike weath
er the churches were crowded with wor
shippers and the streets of the city were
filled with merry throngs of men. women
end children, who left their Christmas
trees in their homes and went out for a
breath of invigorating air.
â¢ It Is estimated that more money was
f peat in Christmas gifts this year in New
lork than ever betore. and the same is
true in regard to charitable gifts.
Of all the set Christmas feasts that of
the Salvation Army at Madison Square
oarcen this evening was the largest. A
bountiful Christmas dinner was served to
about 4000 persons, men women and chil
cren. The cost was defrayed from a fund
of about 56000 collected by the army, chief
ij through the kettles which for several
weeks have hung from tripods in various
i>arts of the city to receive contributions
:To keep the Cnristmas pot boiling."
All afternoon 4D0 helpers were busy lay
ing the fifty tables and preparing the food
to make good cheer for tnis army from
'the city's poor, and probably no happier
Christmas crowd could have been found
in the city. .Men and women, drawn from
all walks of life into the ranks of the Sal
vation Army were eagerly enjoying the
pleasure of bringing Christmas cheer to
others, and one of the happiest of this 400
was the grandson of the late Archbishop
Trench or Canterbury, a new recruit, who
made merry as he <>e<?led potatoes.
Miss Helen Gould provided the dinner
to the boys at the 3Voody Crest Sanita
rium, which she maintains near Tarry
town.
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Gould provided a
Christmas tree loaded with presents and
eervc-d a dainty luncheon to the 200 school

At the United Charities offices the dis
tribution of Christmas gifts to the poor
was not finished until late to-night. Vari
ous voluntary contributions of clothes,
food and money had been distributed by
the workers during the past week, and
thousands of presents were received by

NEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE.
A NÂ«w Journal That Will Be Printed
in Â¦â' Seven ; Languages.
One result of the Chinese trouble , is
that Peking, 'for the first. time In Its his
tory, is to have a foreign Journal. . It will
be called The China Times, and the man
ager is to be J.- Co wen, the <Â¦ editor T.
Cowen; the latter of whom ls^ well known
In the # Far. East; for not only has he been
connected with many local Journalsâ the
Kobe ; ; Chronicle. ; the Hongkong ; Daily
Press, jthe Japan. Times and â¢ the 'Hong
kong Telegraph-but he also acted as spe
cial . correspondent of tha : Times during
the China-Japan war, and as special cor
respondent of â¢ the i London .Â¦ Dally " News
and Reuter's Agency, at other times. - The
remarkable feature about , the new- Jour
nal is that it will be printed in ; se*en lan
guages, namely, :Chlnese, Japanese, -Eng
lish, French,- German, Russia and Italian.
That is an . immense undertaking. It In
dicates Â¦ the employment of Â¦ a . large staff
requiring a correspondingly extensive cir
culation. :Mr. Cowen doubtless hopes. to
find the latter in his Chinese and Japan
ese clientele, but we are disposed. to think
that in order to ' achieve that object Â« It
would have been better - for Â¦ him to . fix
the ; price : of the paper at : less ; than $10
yearly. Yet, after all; $10 is only two sov
ereigns, ; and a penny paper costs thirty
shillings per annum. The most expensive
Journal In Japan, the Jijl Shimpo, may be
had for fifty sen, or one shilling, - per
months though we ; admit that no rule ia
to be Inferred from the Japanese charges,
which are quite too small. - Every one will
wish success to this new venture' and aa
rnlre i the courage of Its projectors. "We
suppose that â¢ it will Â¦ absorb : the Tientsin
Times, and we shall.be sorry, to bid adieu
to ! the latter, > which ' has been â¢ excellently
conducted - during -r the past two . years.â

Nearly twenty Englishmen are now at
work on seven umbrellas for an Ashantl
chief and his faithful staff. There Is.noth
ing under the sun a chief can wear, not
even excepting a cast-off silk hat or a
red-lined cavalry coat, so calculated to
strike awe .into the minds of refractory
natives and Â«M> Imbue them with a spirit
of obedience as a gingham. Traders,
when they want to obtain a free access
to the country, of one of the hostile tribes,
make presents of worn-out clothing to the
natives,. or even a gamp to a particularly
obstinate and pugnacious chief. ' A Lon
don syndicate of Gold Coast traders haa
given the order, and Is paying for the
umbrella in question, which will be given
to bribe the. vain, dusky warriors.
When flnlslied the umbrellas will be gor
geous beyond the dream of the most im
aginative negro. For the chief the pres
ent will be nearly fifteen feet across, quite
a decent sized tent. In: fact, on state oc
casions it will be Â«o used. The handle will
then be stuck in the ground and six slaves
will act as tent pegs. The material from
which it Is being made is silk, and the
colors are to be red, white and blue.
Around the . edge ; will be a : deep, rich
fringe, and on the top an elaborately
chased cap surmounted by a British lion,
rampant. For the staff the umbrellas will
be somewhat smaller and less majestic-

brought from Syracuse, N. Y., to take
their places were 6ent home to-day and
two others were Induced to quit and agree
not to eo back to worki One of them was
wllllnK to leave town, but refused to ac
cept money from the strikers. He said
he would walk every step to Syracuse
rather than take money out of . the
strikers' treasury. He also said that be
was told that there was no strike here,
and that if things were not satisfactory
when he arrived here he would be furnish
ed his fare home. " "
. - Only two cars Â¦ were run in the whole
city: to-day. One of these on which Su
perintendent Patterson was motorman ran
off the track at 11 o'clock and* was . so
badly damaged it had to be taken. to the
barn. No other car was sent to replace
It and at 11:30 the other of the two cars
was taken in and housed.
Thirty-one men" arrived to-night from
New York City to take the places of the
strikers. : but seventeen quit at the rail
road station at the . solicitation of the
strikers' scouts and promised to go back
to. New York. They say they were re

N. W., WASHINGTON, Deo. 25.â Fail-
ure of Congress to enact the army re
organization bill before adjournment
menaces the success of the work of re
storing peace and order in the Philippines,
and is giving tho War Department cause
for great concern. This much is certain,
the return of volunteers will bo delayed
and tho Government will be put to addi
tional expense to bring' them back to the
United States for discharge before Juno
SO and to forward regiments tp Manila to
take their places. It had been intended
by Secretary Root . to begin the return
movement next Tuesday, and one regi
ment may start on that day, but it is In
tended to maintain the force in the islands
at 60,000 men. In order not to fall below
this limit it will be necessary to retain
troops which should be on their way to
Ban Francisco.
There is a disposition to criticize the
Senate, | which J is responsible for holding
up the army measures, the President and
Secretary Root having .pointed out In the
strongest possible terms the necessity for
expedition, and the House acted promptly.
Regarding the necessity for Immediate
reorganization. Adjutant General Corbln
said to-day:
"The department is hopeful that there
will be no delay" in,, the subject of army
reorganization Immediately after Congress
reconvenes. There will be considerable
detail involved irÂ»the organisation of new
regiments and enlistment and the dispatch
of additional men to fill vacancies existing
In regiments of the regular a;my who will
remain in the archipelago, but I am satis
fied this can bo attended to with reason
able expedition once Congress gives the
necessary authority."
Secretary Root fully explained 'to the
Senate Military Committee the absolute
necessity of prompt action. With the
present force under General MacArthur's
command it. has been possible to place a
large area under military contraband to
provide protection to Filipinos anxious for
peace and good government. Municipal
.governments have been generally estab
lished-and natives are beginning to un
derstand the beneficial results of Amer- 1
lean sovereignty. Naturally the Filipinos
in arms desire to prevent accession to
the American cause, and will use every
means.. Including Intimidation, to accom
plish this end,. - The Secretary said:
Â¦ "Unless we want to break faith with
Filipinos who have trustfully accepted our
offers pr protection and are .flllms offices,
n? wTthrtJ^ i n d ( an 5 er 2? murde r In case

ond eet was red hot. every point being
fought for and was finally wen by Smjth,

gether in the finals and a good and close
match was played. Smith won the first
set, 6 â 1. and the second and ma.tch,' 6 â 3.
His playing was of high order and at no
etage of the game did his opponent have
a chance to beat him. Crowell was er
ratic at times and could not steady hlm
eelf at critical moments. Smith's smash
ing- and volleying could not have been
better, and it would have taken a cham
pion to have downed him.

THE Easterner marveled at the
beautiful weather, then he
gazed in wonderment at the
great crowd Â¦which filled 'the
grand stand and betting ring
and trampled the lawns at
Tanforan Park yesterday. It
jras a + merry holiday gathering of
fully MM people, just as ready and
willing to toss off a couple of dollars
on a long shot as it was to extend a
hearty reception to J. T. Sloan. And, by
the way, Tod, as he was called here some
years ago. before his triumphal tour of
the Continent, was the bright particular
star of the whole show. All were familiar
with the diminutive rider's troubles with
the English racing ptewards, and every
body seemed anxlods to get a glimpse of
the Jockey who had hobnobbed with
Princes, given Dukes the bloomin" glassy
eye, and by the way of pastime cracked
the "boko" of a "blolmed cockney bar
boy." And so, when the horses were sum
moned to the post for the Christmas han
dicap, snd Tod seated on the back of Ve
suvian left the paddock, the grand stand
rose ea masse, tendering him an ovation.
As the Judges' stand was reached, the
crack rider was presented with an elegant
floral horseshoe, bowing his acknowledg
ments for the gift. And after all this
fuss and eputter, Clem Jenkins with the

leg up on Eddie Jones, the brown Morello
horse, led Sloan's mount past the wire for
the rich $4000 prize. Fortunate, indeed, it
was for the winner that Greyfeld was
practically left at the post, though
through no fault of Mr. Dwyer, for the
chestnut horse would assuredly have
gained all the fame and dollars as well.
Such, however, is racing luck.
So nicely adjusted were the weights and
the distance, one and a quarter miles, bo
popular, that fully half a dozen owners

all Eerved to make the betting good, and
the v 21 bookmakers were kept busy.
Naturally enough, the Jennings pair,
Vesuvian and Andrlsa, the former carry-
Ing 118 pounds, equal weights with Ad
vance Guard, ruled favorites throughout.
Alex Shields felt confident Advance Guard
could do the trick, and advised his friends
to lay It down thick on the iron colt. Pat
Dunne seemed satisfied with the 108
allotted Scales, and with O'Connor In the
pilot house^ his entry received : healthy
support- Burns & W'aterhouse started
both Mortgage, and Eddie Jones, most re
liance being placed on the mare, with her
ninety-nine pound assignment. Phenom
enally fast workouts previous to the race,
and the presence of Bullman In the sad
dle, caused a preat plunge to be made
on Greyfeld. "Bob" Smith said there was
no way his horse could be beaten,' his
price falling gradually from 5 to 34 to 1.
In fact, it could be said he was the real
favorite for the race. At the post Vesu

telling Jenkins^ after the race that Vesu
â¢vlan was beaten far down the stretch.-/
â¢ .There .was a flood of coin In the ring,
but the books reaped no great harvest,
as the three winning favorites were all
well 'backed. Brutal and Gold Or were
also well supported at remunerative bclds.
The , track .while good was far from. being
in Hghtnlng-faat condition, the perform
ance of Eddie Jones being the best of the
afternoon;
A mile- run, decided under selling con
ditions, opened the sport. Dr. Bernays,
carrying Domjnick and 105 pounds, had a
pronounced call in the ring, and through
the excellent handling received, won rid
den out from Owensboro by a neck. Gar
net Ferguson's colt Alee set a fast clip
out In tront to the stretch, when he be
gan fading. av/ay and ran unplaced. So
cialist, it was thought by many, might do
the turn, but he backed up badly after
chasing Alee. ;
Ten maiden two-year-olds next- paraded
with the colors up. Pat Dunnes Tola
was touted as a good thing, and the geld
ing did show quite a flight of speed.
When headed *or the stand, Farrell shook
up. Princess Titania, the favorite, and she
forged to the. front, beating Tola hands
down. Litmus, a 40 to 1 shot, got up In
time to take the show from Infra. Slap
Dash, quite a heavily backed one, failed
to run as well as expected.
Following this the . new steeplechase
course received Its baptism, a field . of
five going over- the tortuous route. 4t
was .a handicap, and L6mo, piloted by
Bob .Cairns, and an 8 to 5 favorite, again
earned brackets. Lord Chesterfield, with
top-weights up, 156 pounds, was the con
tender throughout, but could not over
haul Lomo In the run home., Texarkana
cut a wide swath out in the lead for quite
a piece, coming to grief at the obstacle
following the water jump. â¢ Lomo Is an
extremely safe jumper, and handled his
155 pounds to perfection. Mestor, many
lengths behind, again fell heir to the
*>mall end of the purse.
It begins to look as If Prince Poniatow
ski has a more than useful piece of racing
bric-a-brac In Brutal. Canmore,- from
AValter Jennings' stable, looked a "moral"
on paper for the â¢ Westchester handicap
at. seven furlongs, but proved almost easy
for- Brutal. The Prince's two-year-old
was backed down" from 8 to 4, and through
Mounce's injudicious handling of the first
choice won with O'Connor taking matters
quietly at the close. Bernota got the
worst of the. break at the post, and Selde
ran Into the show. â¢ . -
Burns*&-Waterhouse took the final race
on the card, â¢ a seven-furlong purse, run
with their recent purchase, Gold Or. The
ring laid 9 to 2'about the big sprinter, and
after he had followed In the wake of

v:as the grievance of a score of opera

been compelled to labor fourteen hours a

by the postcface authorities, who suspend

turned to their labors.

Should Go Through Solely
on Its Merits.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec. 25.â Senator
Ilanna was Informed to-day of a state
ment which is In circulation to the effect
that there was a powerful lobby in favor
of the subsidizing of American shipping
at the Philadelphia convention and in
"Washington.
"The only lobby of the kind that I know
anything about." was the Senator's
answer, "is a lobby of foreign steamship
companies who are trying to defeat the
bill. There was no lobbying at Philadel
phia at all. The subsidy bill is a wise
measure, and there is no desire to force
it through Congress. We want it to go
through on its merits. It has been three
years in preparation, and has been
amended twenty times. The President, in
all his messages, has urged the necessity
of some such measure, and It was made a
plank in the St. Louis platform and the
Philadelphia platform. The details are
left to Congress to work out."

WASHINGTON, Dec 25.â The following
notice was posted to-day by the Secre
tary of Agriculture: Milton Whitney,
chief of Division of Soils, reports a suc
cessful termination of experiments con
ducted In co-operation with the Connecti
cut experiment station in the production
of Sumatra tobacco near Hartford. Ono
third of an acre was planted under a
cheesecloth shade three feet high and cul
tivated and fermented under the direction
of M. L. Floyd, tobacco expert of the de
partment. The yield of cured tobacco was
600 pounds, making an estimated yield for
one acre of 2100 pounds. This lost about
10 per cent in the fermentation. The crop
has just been sold by Ij. B. Haas & Co.
of Hartford to Michaelson & Hibbard of
Kansas City for $473 70, making an esti
mated value for one acre of $142L The
cost of production. Including the whole
cost of the shade â the frame for which
will last five yearsâ will not exceed S500
per acre, leaving a net profit of over $900
per acre. This was an average price of 71
cents per pound. The crop grown in the
same field without shade yielded about
the came quantity and brought 27 cents
per pound, or at the rate of 5507 87 per
acre. Deducting cost of cultivation, this
would leave a profit of about $300 per acr*.
The ordinary crop of the Connecticut Val
ley brings the farmer about 20 cents per
pound, or $360 per acre, and deducting the
cost of expenses leave a profit of about
$260 per acre.
The Sumatra tobacco grown under shade
has been submitted to New York and
Philadelphia business men and has been
pronounced satisfactory and fully equal
to imported Sumatra. "
These facts show that we can grow Su
matra tobacco of the highest Quality In
this country and save our farmers be
tween $6,000,000 and $7,000,000 which Is now
sf>nt ahroad annuallv for the foreign
grown leaf. This work is the result of
the soil survey made in the Connecticut
Valley two years ago, and similar results
can be expected only from similar areas
where the soils and climatic conditions
are similar to those In the. Connecticut
Valley and in Florida.

Editor of London Daily Mail
Comments Upon New
Journalism.
Predicts th.e Formation of Great
Meu-spaper Trusts Wltose Power
to Influence the World Would
Be Enormous.
NEW YORK. Dec". 25.-Alfred Harms-
Trcrvh, editor and proprietor of the Lon
oon Daily Mail, who Is a passexiger on the
Teutonic, due in New York to-morrow.
has contributed to the January number
of the North American ReView an article
on what he calls "The Simultaneous
Newspapers of the Twentieth Century."
Mr. iiarnisworth expressed the opinion
that in spite cf all the progress that has
been made in the development of the
newspaper hitherto, we are still merely
at the tringe of journalistic development.
Of newspaper illustration he saye:
"An occasional newspaper illustration.
If It caa be properly produced, is no uoubt
a good Chixut. and is appreciated as help
lui by the reader; but many of the pres
ent cay illustrations are Quite unneces
sary and are merely given as a matter of
habit or because rival journals use them.
cr even for the less urgent reasons that
there is a certain ajnouiit of space to tm
cecoraied and artists or photographers
to bo kept occupied. No daily journal
which relies principally upon its Illustra
tions has been, in any real sense, an over
whelming success. Â¦'
Mr. .Harms worth takes exception to the
hopelessly clumsy shape of tne ordinarv
newspaper.
"With the newspapers of the whole civ
ilized world before me." he said, "each
week I look In vain for any great and im
pressive stroke of originality or daring.
we still cling to the clumsy and awK
ward shape in which our newspapers are
issued, and the man who has attempted to.
manipulate one. of them on a windy day
Â¦will best appreciate the force of my re
marks. Without new machinery' it would
be Impossible to issue the newspaper of
the future in what is obviously its proper
Ehapeâ a small portable and neatly in
dexed publication. Among the news
papers that ara, in iry opinion, now mak
irvg progress, setting aside the entire lac*
of commercial morality, axe some of the
French Journals. Thev have always been
noted for their hiph literary excellence.
The anonymous editorial has never been
a. particularly strong feature of the
3r"rench newspaper. On the other hand,
pure literature in the shape of fiction or
criticism has been one of its chief char
acteristics."
The power of the press is not what it
Â¦used to be, is Mr. Harmsworth's opinion.
This, he eaye, is especially true of Eng
land, where the editorial, or leader, which
was formerly read and Quoted by all men
of intelligence, is now scarcely glanced at.
The great cry is for news. But even in
â¢connected with this dissemination of
Tews, the press, in Mr. Harmsworth's
Jufigment, has lost reputation. He says:
"Lately there has begun a kind of inter
necine warfare between the various
organs of the press, by which they very
largely injure their own positions and
that cf their opj>onentE. An item of news
published in one paper is immediately dis
credited in another, and the public, natur
ally enough, comes to the opinion that
newspapers axe usually inaccurate and too
often dismiss a perfectly correct etate
ment as 'mere newspaper talk.' "
Mr. Harmsworth pays a high tribute to
â¢the press of the United States as being,
in one respect, in advance of the pro
gress of his country. "The question," he
eays, "what to put before the public and
in what manner to place it before them
is one that calls for the keenest and best
judgment on the part of the newspaper
directors. Here, undoubtedly, the press
of the T.'nlt^d States is in advance of that
of Great Britain. Such newspaper Iead
*rs as Pulitzer, Dana. Bennett, HearÂ«t, |
Raymond. Jonef. Childs. Medlll. Lawson.
Eussell. Cummings. Taylor. Halstead,
Patterson. De Young. Slngerly, God kin.
Greelin. McKelway. Watterson and Sto
rpy have had but a few counterparts â¢with j
us. The instinct that tells what is news
and how the public will best take it is not
given to every writer. There is a. great
art in feeling the pulse of the peopie."
â¢ Predicting what the journals of the
twentieth century will be. he says:
"I feel certain that the newspapers of
the twentieth century will be drawn into
the vortex of combination and centraliza
tion. In fact, given the man. the capital,
the organization and the occasion, there
jecms to be no reason why one or two
newspapers may not presently dominate
great sections of the United States or al
most the whole of Great Britain. In other
â¢words, where there are now a multitude
of papers, good* bad, and Indifferent.
there will then be one or two great jour
nals. The method by which such jour
nals would be established would be pre
cisely those employed in the formation of
any "ordinary trust. Possessing its own
ea-b'ee. wires, dispatch boats and special
trains, the simultaneous, newspaper con
cern would ?oon have its own paper mills,
printing ink factories, machinery shops
and the like.
â¢â¢The simultsr.^ous newspaper would
represent a standard of excellence which
has never before been attained, and with
its own vast resources it would be able to
carry out on an unprecedented scale en
terprises outside of the strict newspaper
field.
"Mr. Pulitzer's wonderful stroke of jour
nalistic genius in connection with the
bond issue. Mr. Hearst's successful ap
peal to the people on the war Issue be
tween the United States and Spain and
the work of British newspapers in con
nection with the South African campaign
go to show what can be done In the direc
tion of influencing public opinion even un
der existing circumstances. Imagine,
then, the influence which would be ex
erted if an overwhelming majority of the
newspapers In the United States spoko
with the sane voice, supported the same
principles and enunciated the same policy.
"Such a ftate of things would be a ter
ror to evil-doers and to the supporters of
anything inimical to the commonwealth."
Mr. Harmsworth is strongly of the opin
ion that the newspapers should not be
partisan in a poetical sense, but should |
endeavor to represent the will of the
people.

The advance of civilization threatens to run over
many of our, best industries; the Southern States are
boasting of their increased output of cottonseed oil,
which is frequently sold as olive oil, and along the
Mississippi they have begun canning catfish and
branding them as salmon.
The heroes who Â¦volunteered on such a forlorn
hone as that are men of whom the whole nation m3y
In that connection it is worth noting that an ex
tremely interesting story is told by W. P. Bradley in
an article, on "Submarine Navigation," published in
the Popular Science Monthly for December. In giv
ing an account of a submarine boat used by the Con
federates during the war to attaclc United States war
ships off Charleston, he states that in her trial: trip
the boat sank and her entire crew was drowned; She
was raised from the bottom and another crew volun
teered to test her. Again she sank and all except
four of the crew were lost. On the, third trial she
sank again, and all hands were' drowned. Neverthe
less the boat was again fitted out and another crew
was found ready to volunteer to make an attack with
her upon the Housatonic. That crew succeeded in
blowing up 'the warship, but their boat perished," and
with her alKthe crewwere killed. y
The question of danger Mr. Holland dismisses as
a matter of such improbability it is hardly worth
while taking it into calculation. There will be acci
dents, of course, for they occur in all forms of activ
ity, but -he does not believe they will be so frequent
under water as above it. On that point he jsays:
"Twenty-one years I have been experimenting with
submarine craft. I have traveled in submerged boats
under all sorts of and with all sorts of
crews. AH my work has been experimental, the
mqst dangerous stage of any mode of travel. Yet I
have never had an accident."
In an article in the current number of the North
American Review on "The Submarine Boat and Its
Future," he avows an expectation * of seeing sub
marine boats engaged in regular passenger traffic
within ten years, and goes on to say: "For trans
atlantic travel submarine boats will never be possible
commercially. Here and there no doubt such boats
will cross, but the regular ocean carrying trade will
be always conducted on the surface. For short trips,
however, the submarine boat offers commercial ad
vantages that will render it a dangerous rival to the
surface vessel, if, indeed, it does not drive the latter
entirely out of competition in particular waters. Take,
for example, the trip across the English Channel.
No other water journey causes an equal amount of
suffering. The most hardy traveler becomes sea-r
sick. The fogs and heavy traffic are constantly caus
ing collisions. * * * The submarine boat will
effectually remove all these objections. There will
be no sea-sickness because in a submerged boat there
is absolutely no perceptible motion. * * * There
will be no collisions because the boats coming and
going will travel at different depths. The water over,
bead may be crowded with large and with small craft,
but the submarine boat will have a free and unob
structed course. Storms and fogs will have no ex
istence for the traveler, for weather cannot penetrats
below the surface of the water."
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION.
JOHN P. HOLLAND, constructor of the famous
submarine torpedo boat which bears his name,
is sanguine that the problems of submarine
navigation have been virtually mastered, and that all
remaining to be done is to develop and perfect the
mechanism of the submarine vessels now in operation.
He is of the opinion we shall soon see submarine
boats used for navigation of short waterways, and
argues that under some circumstances they will be
much more advantageous than surface vessels.
ONE of the significant signs of the times is the
appearance in the advertisements of what are
known as "resort" hdtels in the Eastern and
Southern States of the phrase, "Consumptives ex
cluded." It shows how far back the pendulum has
swung from the days not long ago when such hotels
made a special effort to attract people of weak lungs
by describing their localities as well fitted for the cure
of persons afflicted with consumption. \ /
In one of these advertisements now' before us it i?
announced that the hotel is in "the highest and dr>
est section of the long leaf pine region of North
Carolina, an. ideal place for health, rest and recrea
tion." That is exactly the sort of advertisement which
in former years would have added that the location is"
a "natural sanitarium" for consumptives, but now it
notes in big letters "Consumptives excluded."
Humanity, jn its' action and reaction invariably goes
too far in each direction. Undoubtedly considerable
evil resulted to healthful communities by the persis
tent efforts of tourist hotels to obtain the patronage of
consumptives. Germs of the disease were in that way
brought into districts whose people would otherwise
have been in no danger of that scourge. On the
other hand, the policy .of exclusion which is now
threatened is likely to result in evils fully as great.
The consumptive should not be treated like a pariah
nor shut away from' the comfortable hotels that have
been. established in the healthful sections of the coun
try. Advertising for consumptives was a folly, but
the exclusion of them would be something like an
outrage on humanity.
Should the exclusion policy be carried far, it will be
necessary for States to provide sanitariums for those
afflicted with consumption. Some, States, in fact, have
already done so. These institutions > have even in the
short time of their existence effected much good. A
recent report of one established in Massachusetts was
so encouraging in jts nature that* New York set about
following the example. Â»A similar movement has been
started to establish a sanitarium in this State, and it
is probable that like enterprises are under way else
where.
While these movements are good, there is the ob
jection that the campaign of education in their favor
is often conducted in an exaggerated 'way so as to
occasion something like a panic on the subject. Con
sumption is not now any more dangerous than it was
ten j'ears ago when every Southern winter resort was
advertising for consumptives. As a matter of fact it
is not so dangerous, for the world has learne'd, much
in late years concerning the disease, and care is no w\
exercised to prevent its spread. There is conse
quently less reason for exclusion now than ever before,"
and it is hardly likely the intense reaction from the
policy of former years can be maintained very long.
The one good feature of the scare manifest by
these advertisements' is that it will help along the edu
cation of the public mind in regard to the disease and
thus help to check it in e^eryipart of the Union! At
present it is one of the greatest scourges of Ameri
can life. Consumption destroys more > lives in New
England than yellow fever in : the South, and yet "un
til iyery recently little or nothing was -done to; deal
with it in a scientific way. Now there is good prom
ise that the ravage will be greatly diminished within
afewiyears, and it is to be hoped the phrase "Con
sumptives excluded" will not long . be seen [ in the ad
vertisements of any American hotel.*
CONSUMPTIVES EXCLUDED.
It will be seen the white man's burden is heavy and
that it will probably continue so for a long time.
"Pacification" appears to be as costly as war. It
seems, moreover, to be all the same whether at
tempted upon weak men or strong men. We are hav
ing almost as much trouble in toting Aguinaldo's bur
den as the British have in shouldering that of Kruger.
Out of our present troubles good, we trust, will soon
be forthcoming; but we ought tojearn now the lesson
cf what it costs to foice civilization upon even the
weakest of races that piefers freedom to any blessings
we can give in exchange.
In the Philippines our situation is hardly better.
Reports from Washington state that at a conference
en Christmas eve^ between the Secretary of War and
Quartermaster General Ludington it was decided that
no further action can be taken with regard to the re
turn of the volunteers from the Philippines until Con
gress shall make provision for their replacement. The
report goes on to say: "Acting upon representations
made by General MacArthur, the department has con
cluded that it is absolutely necessary to maintain an
army of 60.000 men in the Philippine Islands until the
current policy of establishing municipal government
throughout the archipelago has been executed. It is
stated zt the department that with any reduction of
the military strength below that figure existing condi
tions would doubtless j rove most disastrous to the in
terests of the United States."
For more than a year the British have been warring
against the "Boers. Every city or town of note in the
two republics is now in the hands of the civilizer and
under the British flag. Nevertheless not a single Brit
ish soldier can be spared from the front unless an
other is first sent to take his place. It is said there
are now more men with the British colors in South
Africa than there were at this time last year, and still
the demand is for reinforcements. Fresh troops are
to be sent not only from Great Britain but from the
colonies, and many of them arc now on the way.
There is an immense distance between the Boer and
the Filipino, and that distance is fully revealed in the
contrast between their methods of making war. The
Boers have shown strategy, tactics, skill and darinsr
and indomitable resistance. They have performed
deeds that will shine brilliantly on the pages of his
tory. It is quite possible that Dewet may rank in fu
ture along with the most renowned patriots wl/o with
few and scattered forces have withstood the armies of
the invaders of their country. None of those things
can be said of the Filipinos. They have shown neither
skill nor courage according to our standards of such
things. Aguinaldo is not the sort of man who
realizes any of our ideals of a hero. In one thing,
however, the Boer and the Filipino are alike. They
will neither of them quit fighting. They will neithc r
c{ them consent to be pacified in the interests of civili
zation.
GREAT BRITAIN stands first and our own
great republic stands- second among the na
tions that are at this time bearing the burden
of civilizing recalcitrant peoples. Each is earnestly
<eekinÂ£ pacification and finding it not. Each declares
that war is over, but ench knows better than to with
draw- any portion of her forces from the scene of war.
THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.
tt tt ETTT GREEN, whose latest
=Â«s= I photograph is presented here
1 with, is supposed to be, the rich-
II JJL est woman in America. Yet
Mrs. Green Is not generally
looked upon as an extravagant woman.
A hall bedroom in an obscure boarding
house amply fulfills her ideas of a home.
Her meals are frugal and her gowns are
not made by Worth.
Mrs. Green's cnosen boarding houses,
says a writer in the Brooklyn Eagle, are
obscure not especially (because she is fond
of, seclusion, but rather because of her de-
Eire to escape the attentions of report
ers. If* there Js one thing on earth that
Mrs. Green detests more than a reporter
it is another reporter. They are the bane
of her life, for they insist upon printing
things about her frugality just because
she's rich. These stories are sometimes
more or less interesting, but they are not
exactly of the sort to promote the entente
cordlale between Mrs. Green and the re-,
porters. Up to the hour of going to press
no man who has attempted to write about
! the Inner life of Mrs. Hetty Green has
ever allowed himself to be hampered and
bound down. by a paucity of facts. But
here is one story about Hetty Green,
which has never been printed, which is
absolutely true.
It happened in Chicago in April, 1897.
The Cubans were struggling against great
odds to gain their freedom. A committee
of one hundred prominent Chicago women
was formed to raise funds for Cuban hos
pitals of which Mrs. P. was secretary.
;jlrs. P. took up her work -with unbounded
and energy. She heard that
Hetty Green was at the Great Northern
Hotel.- so she decided to solicit a small
contribution for suffering Cubans from
the richest woman in America. She had
heard tales about Mrs. Green's frugality,
so she fortined herself both with sound
arguments and pathetic appeals. She
meant to overwhelm Hetty with such a
torrent of eloquence that she couldn't re
sist the temptation to part with some of
her dollars. Or. if worst came to worst,
hhe would talk until Hetty would be glad
to purchase silence with a contribution.
Mrs. P. found Hetty In one of the big
business blocks she owns in Chicago, su
perintending the work of a corps of scrub
women. Mrs. P. had fixed up a most elab
orate plan of campaign. She would in
troduce herself first, of course, and as
her family is prominent, that would se
cure a respectful hearing which would be
all the more readily accorded because of
her stunning costume. Having thus car
ried the outer works of the enemy by
storm. Mrs. P. proposed to follow up her
advantage closely by a withering fire of
unabridged dictionaries which would not
give Mrs: Green a chance to say a word
except at the end, when she would faintly
gasp:
"Put me down for a thousand dollars."
It worked to perfection up to the point
where Mrs. P., after Introducing herself,
had stated her business. Then, by a bril
liant flanking movement. Mrs. Green car
ried her assailant off her feet, cut her off
from her reserves and. then poured in a
murderous torrent of small talk at short
range. Hetty began with a circumstantial
account of her war on cockroaches In the
old building of her many reverses and final
triumph ending in a massacre of every
surviving cockroach. She told the history
of the dress she wore. As it was a very
ancient dress not built originally for Mrs.
Green, the tale required much time for
the telling. Then followed with a wealth
of detail the manner in which Mrs. Green
had trimmed her hat and the marvelous
cheapness thereof. From this, by a gentle
and artistic trausition. the richest woman
entered upon a life history of her scrub
women, taking up the biography of one at
a time. This suggested a disquisition
upon the worthlessness of hired help and
the means of combating it hit upon by
Mrs. Green. Combat suggested lawyers
and lawyers called to mind numberless In
stances of the depravity and greed of the
whole caboodle. %
By this time Mrs. P. f 9 head was swim
ming and she felt faint. But, brave woman
that she was, she tried again and again to
stem the torrent of Mrs. Green's elo
quence long enough to work in a word
about the Cubans. As a last resort she
pulled out a Cuban button, which she of
fered to Mrs. Green for ten cents, tha cash
to go to the Cuban hospital fund.
The offer was spurned.
Mrs. P. fled. The footman had almost
to carry her across the sidewalk and lift
her into her carriage.
But the fresh air revived her. She or
dered the coachman to drive to the Trib
une ofnee. called for pencil and paper,
wrote an account of her two hours* inter
view with the richest woman in America,
its object and result, sold the story to the.
paper at space rates, credited the Cubans
with $5 received for the story and drove
home with the serene consciousness of
having taken the last trick.
One of the latest on Mrs. Green is told
by a business acquaintance. He met Mrs.
Green one day and noticed that she looked
very ill. Upon Inquiry he was told that
Mrs. Green was ill. She explained that
she had ordered two boiled eggs for
breakfast at a cheap restaurant that
morning, and, that not feeling hungry^
she had eaten some toast and tea and put
the eggs in her pocket for future refer
ence, as a frugal person should. Later in
the day, when ehe felt the need Of food,
she had opened the eggs. They were not
as good as some eggs sometimes are, but
they were bought and paid for, and Mrs.
Green was not the sort of woman who
could deliberately forego a chance to get
the worth of her money.
- So she ate the eggs andâ

Britons and Boers.
The British policy may be summed up
as. first, peace and submission, and then
extension of self-government as rapidly
as possible. The weak point In this con
structive. policy Js that the Boers may
refuse to accept it. They have not been
fighting for more home rule under the
British crown, but for absolute free
dom. For that vital point they are still
fighting. The success of the British
policy obviously depends on Lord Kitch
ener's ability to convince the Boers that
it is better to yield than to fiarht. The
question Is still primarily a military one.
for so far the Boers are standing fast
by the idea that they would rather be
dead than be British subjects.â CHICAGO

In view of these recent lynching* in

to taunt the South with its outrages
against justice or its contempt for the

more frequently in the South than in the
North. There have been but seven cases
this year izr Northern States, while there
have been 101 in the Southern, most of
the victims being negroes, but, when it
is taken into account that four of the
seven Northern victims have been ne
groes, that they were in three different
States, that the negro population of the
South is vastly greater than that of the
North, and that there are proportionately
a larger number of ignorant and vicious
negroes in the South, further criticism of
its conduct is improper. Those who live

MRS. HETTY GREEK, THE RICHEST WOMAN' IX AMERICA^. CONCERN
ING WHOM THE PRESS OF THE COUNTRY HAS PUBLISHED MANY
STORIES.
The man who has remembered the poor with help
fulness and not with a vain sympathy is the man who
will have the best of the Christmas joys, and if any
have forgotten that truth it is well to remind him it
is"not too late yet to act upon it.
It has been claimed that the House of Representa
tives is already too large, but the claim is not well
founded. In comparison with other representative
bodies it is, in fact, small. The British House of
Commons contains-6/O members, the French Chamber
of Deputies 584, and the German Reichstag 397.
Neither of those countries has anything like so large
a population as the United States, nor has either of
them so much territory, or such diversities of interest
to be represented. It would appear, therefore, that an
increase in the House is not in itself objectionable.
The Hopkins bill is too conservative. California
should have another Representative, and our Con
gressmen should unite with those who favor a larger
House.
The opposition to the bill comes not only from
States that would lose members by it! adoption, but
aJso from States that have expected a gain in the
number of Representatives. A minority bill proposes
to increase the membership of the House to 387, or
one for every 192,676 of population. Under that rule
Nebraska would be the only State that would lose a
Representative. There would be a gain of four in New
York, three each in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas;
two in Minnesota and New Jersey, and of one in
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, , Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Washington, West
Virginia and Wisconsin.
Under that bill it will be seen that New York, New
Jersey, Louisiana, Illinois, Minnesota and West Vir
ginia would each gain one member, and Texas wpuld
gain two. Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Nebraska, South Carolina and Virginia would each
lose one member. California's delegation would re
main unchanged.

It will be seen that in this, as in other trades, ex
perience teaches. The British alone among civilized
nations have had practice in the gentle art of spoil
ing the enemy during the life of this generation. Their
veterans are old hands at the trade. They managed to
obtain more than the soldiers of other nations, and
doubtless they also exerted the least amount of bru
tality and force in extorting it from the conquered,
for systematic looting is better than irregular looting.
It is a species of economy and obtains the biggest re
sults at the least cost. â¢ ;
In this connection it is worth noting that an eye
witness of the looting done by the soldiery of the
various armies in China gives precedence in the busi
ness to the British. 'I his witness, Robert M. Collins,
v.-ho, as a correspondent of the Associated Press, en
tered both Tientsin and Peking with the allies, says:
"Who were the worst looters? Well, the British wer e
the most successful, because they were most system
atic. They went about it as a'regular piece of busi
ness; sent out men with carts and wagons under com
mand of officers. Their experience in India had
made them connoisseurs in things oriental, and they
selected only the best of the silks and embroideries,
the rarest of the jade and the finest of the jewels, and
left the rest for the less expert looters. The Japan
ese did the least looting, and the Americans were next
to the Japs in this respect." /
The looting done by private soldiers and officers off
duty is of course a different matter. Wherever there
is war there will be looting. To the victors belong
the spoils. The. maxim does not mean so much now
as it did in the days of old Rome, but even yet it
means much. Men who fight have an irrepressible
desire to spoil the enemy and obtain trophies, booty
and plunder. For the private trooper such things are
a part of the stakes of the game, and while pillaging in
our time has been narrowed far below what was tol
erated and even encouraged by the commanders of
armies in times x past, it is still something which even
the most enlightened nations have to wink at when
they go to war.
The allied armies marched to Peking as the avowed
supporters of civilization. It was repeatedly declared
on official authority of all the Governments that their
armies were not making war on China, but were
going toPeking to assist the Chinese Government in
suppressing an insurrection of Boxers. Under, such
circumstances and in the face of such declarations they
had no right to take loot. The utmost they have a
right to demand is indemnity for injury done by the
Boxers and repayment of the cost of the military and
raval "assistance" given to the Chinese Government
without invitation.
CZJRANCE, through her Government" has an-
I nounced that she will not accept any share in the
loot obtained by the armies of civilization in
Peking and other cities of. China. Other Govern
ments, it is to be hoped, will follow the example. As a
matter of fact' there' should have been no looting by
any responsible authority, and so /far as the pillaging
of the soldiery could be prevented, that also should
have been stopped.

fctrata of discord that so long xllsturbed thÂ©
. American Government and eoctv<y.
After the Revolutionary war began Con
cress and the United States Government
were living a gypsy existence, wandering
irom place to place, to keep out of the
way of the pursuing "redcoats." They
lound some security In New Jersey be
cause it was between New York and Phil
adelphia, and considerable of the time was
epent in Trenton. There were a few small
-taverns there, but the citizens wtre hos
pitable and placed their beds at the dis
posal of ' the members of the homeless
Government. The Blazing Star was the
â¢Hg hotel cf the little city, and here Con
gress did itfe business. It has not eur
vived as a reminder of those early days.
The Mechanics' National Bank stands on
the eite. The people began to clamor for
Osngrt-ss to settle somewhere and estab
.lish a permanent business btisis. In June.
" I7K3, Congress announced that It would
open bids for a location, and would settle
down in the State that would offer the
best advantages. Trenton bonifaces ,and
tradesmen were convinced that a national
capital was a eood thing, and the whole
â¢ town became a hustling Board of Trade.
Tf idea pleased the New Jersey Legis
lature, and before the other States were
ialrly awake It declared by resolution that
the State would cede a reservation twenty
miles square to the National Government
* and contribute a subsidy of $Â£1,000 in spe
cie, which was a large sum of money, con
sidering the eize of the treasury. TSQ
Southern Congressmen claimed the capi
tal by right, and declared It should not go
above the Mason and Dixon line. At that
time there were 700.000 slaves In the small
Â§ domain then known as the United States.
The population was 3,500,000. The Puritan

In October, 17S3, Mr. Gerry of Massa
chusetts, remembered principally for the

buildings for the use of Congress be erect

of Congress and for the executive officers
and houses for the President and the Sec
retaries of Foreign Affairs, War and Ma
rine and the Treasury. This ordinance es
tablished In Trenton what since has de
veloped at Washington. The South fought
hard to defeat It. Three commissioners
were appointed to proceed under the act
and start the capital. The Southern
States were not recognized in the commls-
Fion. It consisted of Philip Schuyler of
New York. Philemon Dickinson of Tren
ton and Robert Morris, who lived opposite
Trenton. This commission began busi
ness at once. Washington was impelled to
take sides with the South, and, In an open
letter to Richard Henry Lee, then the
president of Congress, declared that the
Trenton location was not a good one. In
part of this letter he cald: "It will be
found that they are very improperly
placed for the Beat of the empire, and will
have to undergo a second erection in a
more convenient one." Washington'6 let
ter had the effect of withholding the first
appropriation of $30,000, which the com
missioners asked for. Mr. Grayson of
Virginia had the resolution recommitted
When It came up again Mr. Gerry moved
that the whole J100.000 be substituted, but
the amount was stricken out. Another
bone of contention between the North and
the South was the funding bill of Mr.
Hamilton. Secretary of the Treasury.
There was a clash over the clause as
suming the State debts. The debta of the
States Incurred for the general defense
during the Revolution were $25,000,000 The
Eastern States favored the Government
assuming all these debts and to include
them in the funding of the national debt.
Because the New England States wanted
this passed the Southern members stood
firmly out against paying the debt* of the
States They held that It was unconstitu
tional. On the funding bill issues Presi
dent Washington was perpetually dis
tressed, and one day he took Thomas Jef
ferson Into his confidence and said there
was "danger of secession of their mem
bers and of the separation of the States."
Jefferson and Ikimilton were authorized
to get out and make the best bargain they
could before the trouble took deeper root.
Hamilton did missionary work among the
Eastern members and Robert Morris took
the Middle States members.
When the bill came up for the appropri
ation* of $100,000 for the beginning of the
building? at Trenton it was found that a
compromise had been reached. Massachu
setts and New Jersey stood together for
the appropriation; the others favored It
being stricken out, and It was, and that
ended thÂ« contest for the location of the
capital at Trenton. v
It was about this time that the land
for the little burlesque "Federal City"
outside of Trenton was surveyed and
placed on the market. There Is no record
of how many lots were sold. Trenton
was caricatured by the Southern Con
gressmen and praised by the New Eng
landers. The Southern members said the
meals were bad â that nobody knew how
to cook terrapin, prepare a canvasback
duck nor keep wine at the proper temper
ature. The argument about the viands
and victuals had its force. The official
table before Washington became Presi
dent was free and easy and continuous.
He established the weekly official dinners,
and the spirit of the time is reflected in
this quoted comment from a memoir:
"The President said gTace, and then we
dined on boiled leg of mutton, with a few
vegetables. After a simple dessert, one
glass of wine was offered each guest, and
when It had been drunk the President
arose and led the way to the drawing
room."
Ing- ZOO acres, situated within three miles
of Trenton, in Burlington County, within
a mile of Lamberton, where it Is expected
the Federal town will be built."
TRENTON'S GREAT

Dr. H. Vandre was summoned immedi

Mrs. Bowers was 32 years old and a na

three children, the eldest being the daugh

Earlier in the day Mrs. Bowers had said
to her daughter, "This is the last Christ

time the girl thought her mother was only
looking ahead to her probable death with

that theVords were a threat of suicide.

The Duke amended his signature to
"The Duke of Norfolk," and quietly
handed it in. The young woman grew
pale as she read It, and paler still when

No notice was taken of him, and the

The Challenge Is Out.
Wednesday, January the 2d, the great
challenge will take place in this city. â¢
Joaquin Beralla, a Mexican woman, who
keeps a lodging-house at 428 Pacific street,
fired four shots yesterday afternoon at
| John Baxter, a blacksmith, whose place of
business adjoins hers; but, owing to her
unsteady aim, no blood was spilled. When
Officer Skaln, who was a short distance
from the scene of the shooting, reached
the house the woman was standing at her
window with, a smoking revolver In her
hand. *
Baxter, who was on the roof of hla shop,
told the officer that the woman had tried
to kill him. and asked that she be placed
under arrest. She offered no resistance,
and In explanation of her attempt tiÂ»com
mlt murder said that the trouble between
her and her neighbor was a feud of long
standing. Baxter, she declared, would,
whenever, under the influence of liquor,
torment and annoy her, and was ever
ready to provoke a quarrel. For a long
while they have had mix-ups, and their
troubles have been aired several .times In
the police courts. Two weeks ago the po
lice were called upon to settle their differ
ences, and arrests followed at that time.
Yesterday afternoon, so the woman
I says, Baxter made repeated efforts to en

vented. Later, she alleges, when she was
in her room In company with a girl who
lives In the house, Baxter made another
attempt to gain admission. The girl was
dressing at the time, and as Baxter tried
to force the window of the room the Ber
alla woman shot him.
Officer Skain took the woman to the
City Prison, where a charge of assault to
commit murder was registered against
her.
At 11 o'clock last night she was released
on a bond of $500.

HIS CURIOSITY , ABOUSED.
This Miner . Had Never Eaten Heed
Birds Before.
. Lnst week the hotel, population of New
York had two . additions in the . shape of
men from out of the West;. . One was a
shrewd â¢; young , lawyer from . Denver, who
had been In the city before. .The other
was a* grizzled, open-eyed miner.' who, un
!til this trip, hadn't been ten: miles away
from the mining camp where he went as a.
small boy. v Tne old man struck it rich
some years ago, but hadn't money to work
his claim. New York capitalists had been
negotiatingaideahwith him and he came
down East. to close the transaction, brlng
ilng the r>enver. lawyer with mm to protect
him from green goods men and capitalists.
Things; went smoothly and; the ueal was
ibrought to 1 a conclusion, 'leaving the old
miner richer by- almost a million dollars.
He, was slightly staggered when, he began
to realize the situation and: to understand
â¢ thp.t he had money to 'burn; but.helng.a
? man, his first Impulse was to set about
Apple Sandwiches.
These are especially nice for evening en
tertainment. Here are several sorts. For
the first, chop fine a pint of firm, full
flavored apples: mix tiiera with one-quar
ter as much chopped celery, sprinkle with
two tea-spoonfuls sugar, two salt spoon
fuls salt, half a salt spoonful whitÂ© pep
per, a little nutmeg and three tablaspoon
fuls of the very best salad oil. If you
wish an especially piquant flavor, put the
whole mixture In a bowl which has been
rubbed inside with the least suspicion of
garlic. Cut brown bread very thin, but
ter it well and spread with the apples.
Lay the slices together, press them firm
and cut to shape.
For the second, chon tart, juicy apples
very fine, then mix with their own bulk
of pot cheese softened with a little sweet
cream. Season well with salt, pepper and
lemon Juice. Butter bread either white
or brown, very thickly and spread with
the mixture. For the third sort, mix the
chopped apples- with either peanuts or
English walnuts, also chopped very fine,
season with sugar, salt, a dash of tabas
co and a very little onion juice and work
the mixture well Into its own bulk of
double cream cheese. Butter the bread
lightly, spread with the mixture, then dot
> the surface sparsely with pickled capers
or shreds of olive.

At St. John's Episcopal, corner Fifteenth
street and Julian avenue, the fine audi
torium was decorated with evergreens,
large ferns * and flowers. The sermon,
preached by the Rev. L. C. Sanford, was
heard with rapt attention by the unus
ually large congregation, and the music,
under the direction of Esther M. Philips,
left nothing to be desired. "Angels from
the Realms of Glory," sung by the vested
choir, was a particularly fine piece of
choral music.
At Trinity tho offices of the altar were
performed by Dr. Clampett beneath a
blazing star of lncandescents, and the
chancel was a bower of Christmas shrubs
and flowers. The vested choir, under the
direction of the organist. Dr. Stewart,
sang the anthem, "Christmas Star," which
has never been heard to better effect.
Dr. Clampett preached eloquently on the
emotions Christmas roueed in the human
soul, dwelling on the Joy of giving and
the various benefits coming from a proper
holiday spirit.
Bt. Paul's, its arches entwined with pun
gent pine streamers was filled yesterday
by a large congregation, who listened with
great attention to the Christmas sermon
of the Rev. Dr. Reilly, the vicar.. Dr.
Rellly reminded his. hearers that In â the
days of feasting and gift-giving they were
apt to forget the holy purpose for which
the day was observed. "We must keep in
mind," he said, "that the greatest gift of
all Christmas gifts was the one given to
the Virgin in the humble manger beneath
the stars of Palestine. As it was the first
gift, so it was, and ever will be, the
greatest and best. The Christmas lesson
we must learn and remember Is that God
bo loved the world that he gave his only
begotten son that we- might have ever
lasting life."

CHURCHES, HOMES AND INSTITUTIONS
IF those who gave to the Salvation
Army this year could have known
the result of their charity they would
have doubled their . gifts; and If
these who gave not at all cculd have
foreseen the dinner in the basement
of tho OdÂ«i Fellows' Hall, they would
have reached deep Into their pockets and
have divided their Christmas cheer with
those who but for the red-shirtea soldiers
of the Lord would have had none.
Nearly two thousand men and women
were the guests of the army at the public
tables yesterday, and nearly a thousand
more found their Christmas dinner
brought to their houses in baskets. For
everyone who had a home and family and
nothing for the holiday dinner, the army
had a weli filled basket, and these were
sent to the various homes Monday and
yesterday morning. But for the rovers
the big tables were laid in the basement
of the Odd Fellows' building and seventy
of the soldiers waited, upon the guests.
A Christmas dinner for the poor is no
new thing for the Salvation Army, and so
there was no hitch and no delay. Every
thing went smoothly and pleasantly and
everyone who sat down at the tables got
up satisfied and that much the happier.
Lieutenant Colonel William Evans,
chief divisional officer of the army In San
Francisco, was in charge of the work.
Under him was Staff Captain Connett.
the last man had left the tables and the
work of cleaning up the debris was begun.
During the meals the band from the
Salvation Army headquarters played, but
there was no singing except at the sol'
fliers" meal before the public was allowed
In.
During the first weeks of December th<j
various barracks hare had their officers
out looking for men and women who
would avail themselves of the Army din
ner, and each of these was given a ticket
of Identification. But toward the holi
days tickets were given to anyone who
wished, and at the last minute one of th-j
soldiers was stationed outside to pass in
anyone who was hungry and wished to
Join the line of diners.
Taking advantage of an offer to print
his comments. Colonel Evans dictated the

and Staff Captain Crawford, who attend

consisted of roast turkey, roast beef, po
tatoes, turnips, celery, cranberry sauce,
pie, plum pudding, nuts, fruit, candy, tea
and coffee.
Befora the first tables were laid at 11
o'clock the Salvation Army people sat
down to a dinner of their own. with the
friends who had volunteered to help at
the feast. There was a blessing asked
and songs were sung, and then the meal
was tastily dispatched so that all should
be In readiness at 12 o'clock. Just before
12 the waiters, formed a line, each with
three or four plates, according to his or
her dexterity, and at the word of Cap
tain .Connett they passed through the
kitchen. First the vegetables were piled
high on the plates, then the roast beef,
the turkey, then the cranberry sauce and
a finish with a spoonful of gravy over

pan to tho next, while the cooks passed
out the good things on the platen.
There was no word spoken, no trouble
and no confusion, and within a few min

BERKELEY, Dec. S.â Eleven men will
undoubtedly be compelled to pay the sum
of $2750 into the county treasury on ac
count of an error in the publication of
the license ordinance In Saturday's issue
of the town official paper. These men
had been fined J230 each ln the Justice
Court for violating the prohibition law.
Their appealed cases will come up before
Superior Judge Greene to-morrow for final
settlement. A3 the points in the law in
these cases are exactly the same as in
the Fedderwitz case, in which the Su
preme Court rendered a decision for the
plaintiff, there can be but little doubt
that the Superior Court will .uphold the
Justice Court's decision. 'â¢
Had the error In the publication of the
ordinance not happened -the license law
would have been passed last night. Then
the eleven casf s in the Superior Court
would have been dropped from the docket.
As it is now the ordinance will not be
taken up for final passage until next Fri
day night, whfn a special meeting will be
held for that purpose.
The mistake in printing was not dis
covered until Monday evening, so that It
cannot be rectified until to-morrow even
ing,several hours after Judge Greene fhall
have rendered his decision. The trustees
who wanted the license ordinance to be
come a law are bitter in their denuncia

account of tha error. B. F. Arnold the
manager of the Gazette, the official or

the misprint until he saw this morning's

fair, and said that the fault lay -with the
foreman, who, in shifting type In three
different columns for a "place advertise

wrong column. H. L. Hubbell, the fore

affidavit to-morrow that he alone was re

Superintendent Smith, of Mountain View
Cemetery, is looking for two men who
made targets out of headstones in the
cemetery, and has apj>ealed to both the
Sheriff's office and the police of Oak
land to assist him. The men thrashed
. one of the cemetery employes and finally
rna<5e their esoape.
Early this afternoon Superintendent
Smith heard shooting at the rear of the
cemetery, and. as the discharge of guns
thÂ«>re is strictly prohibited, he sent a man
out to warn the shooters away. The man
followed the sound of the shots, which
came at regular intervals as at a shoot
ing range, and soon found two men in
â¢ brown hunting suits contentedly banging
away at a target made out of a headstone
on a grave.. The men had become weary
of tramp:'.:jr the hills back of Blair Park,
and had wandered Â«lo\vn into the ceme

and werÂ«? satisfying themselves with try
ing to flatten bullets on a bullseye made
with charcoal on the smooth back of a
stone.
The cemetery employe charged the
kopje and ordered the men off. The
-marksmen would not go, and finally
wound up by thrashing the cemetery em
ploye In right good shape. As they were
two to one. and armed in addition, and
strongly inclined to be belligerent, the
cemetery man had no choice but to *ub
mit.
When tfcp employe reported back to th*

out a squad of men to capture the tres

A case has arisen In New York growing
out of a statute that is worth describing.
A law provided that "no child under tt.-.<
age of 13 should be employed ln any man
ufacturing establishment, and that all
gearing and belting should have proper
safeguards. A boy who was 13 years old
was employed in a manufactory. While
doing his duty he was in a safe place,
with no danger around hm. But at tha
request of another he pulled out a lever
attached to a machine In order to start
it. and ln doing so he placed his hand on
a wheel, which was drawn downward,
and he was injured. He knew that the
machine was not guarded. He failed to
recover for his Injury. The court remark
ing that he knew tha machinery was not
guarded, and furthermore, he had intelli
gence enough to take care of himself and
to understand the danger if he took hold
of the lever. "The absence of guards can
impose no liability upon the employer
when the boy, knowing of their absence,
voluntarily meddles with the machine."
One might Infer from Aha language that
the request to the boy to move the lever
need not have been given; that he waa
perhaps indulging ln a little sport, 'The
truth was. however, that the request to
pull the lever came from another employe
who was engaged in cleaning the ma
chine. Nevertheless, It was cot a part of
his duty to do this, and consequently bid
employer could not be held liable for the
consequences. The boy's act was purely
voluntary, to accommodate another em
ploye, and consequently there was no help
for the Injured boy. We question whether
he could have recovered anything under
the law, even thougii his employer or his
foreman had requested him to move the
lever. The risk was entirely his own,
however good bis motive* ln thus acting.

"Whether an infant is to be treated as
having assumed the risks of personal in-
Jury to himself from performance of labor
attended with danger, and held to exer
cise of ordinary care and caution in order
to recover damages from Ms employer ln
case of personal injury is always an open
question, depending upon the capacity and
fitness for the particular kind of labor
he may be employed at when so injured."
Therefore, the jury in such a case should
be instructed to find a verdict for tha
child unless his age. intelligence and ex
perience were such as to induce a man of
ordinary care and prudence to believe him
qualified and fitted for the labor at which
he employed him. Such is the opinion of
the Court of Appeals of Kentucky on this
subject.
Voluntary Employment.
of His Employment P
There Is another rule too important to
be omitted. Suppose a child Is injured by
the negligence of another employe, an
adult, can he claim that the master must
recompense him for thÂ« injury thus re
ceived through the negligence of another?
We have learned what is the general rul#
with respect to older employe*â each as
sumes the risk of negligence practiced by
those around them and cannot recover if
they are In the same common service.
Does this rule apply to children? I* they
assume anything? Do they know or un
derstand tno risk they run in working ln
a cotton factory or an iron mill of injury
from the negligence of those around them .'
Of course tney do not know, nor do they
knowingly assume such risks, but the law
regards them or their parents as assuming
those risks, and consequently they can
not usually recover anything for injuries
sustained through the negligence of
others.
When Does a Child Assume the Bisk
Adult.
In a Georgia case it was said that this
rule applied to a youth of 1" who was In
experienced in dealing with a machine by
which he was Injured. The case showed
that the machine was dangerous to an
inexperienced person. Nor aid the age of
the person, so the court said, "deprive
him the right . to be warned. The em
ployers, or the man representing them,
ought under all circumstances to nave in
quired of him as to his experience, or
taken notice of the probability that he
waa so Inexperienced as to render It
proper to give him warning." That his
age alone aid not deprive him of the right
to be warned has been often decided.

How long can a child continue to claim
tne right to receive instructions? It U
quito evident that a different rule ought

ereat juagment or discretion is required.
A. railway company would not be Justlfled
in employing a boy as an engineer, how
ever desirous he might be of serving. IS
he did the company would be holden to
the public for injuries sustained by them
and to Its own workmen. Suppose the
boy was 20, a mature, thoughtful person,
would not the company be justified in thus
employing him? Perhaps so. Suppose hÂ»
were 19? It may be, especially ln excep
tional cases where no older or more com
petent persons could be employed, to

BY ALBERT S. BOLLES. LI* D.
The employment of minors raises some
questions of the highest importance con
cerning the duties of employers. Some of
these were considered In our last article,
but others still remain worthy of notice.
When He Knows the Danger He As
. sumes the Bisk.
. We have already set forth the duty of
an employer to instruct those of youthful
years employed by him. It follows that
after. a minor has been instructed or
warned of the danger he Is about to incur,
and undertakes the employment, he as
sumes the risk like any other employe.
This rule was applied by the Supreme
Court of Missouri in the case of a minor
who was a brakeman on a freight train
and was killed while at his brake upon
the top of a freight car In passing
througn a bridge, the cross Umbers of
which were so low that they struck his
head. The accident happened in the day
time. He had been employed by the rail
road company about three weeks and had
passedÂ«this bridge every day during tne
lime. He had been repeatedly warned to
look out for this and other bridges, and
when last seen he was sitting on his
brake and facing the bridge not far oft.
The court said "'it would almost seem
that he committed suicide," his conduct
was so reckless.
When a Child Need Not Be Instructed.
Again, when a child knows of the dan
ger his employer is not required to in
struct him. This point was settled long
ago, although the cases are constantly
happening in which It is applied. In one
of them a boy 19 years old was employed
in a woolen mill to operate a machine to
shear the nap off cloth. He had been,
instructed in the use of the machine,- al
though he testified that he did not fully
understand the danger. The court said
that if . he undertook the work, ' knowing
the danger, his employer was not liable,
although the accident might have been
prevented by having guards to the ma
chine. ' In another case a boy 17 years old
was set to work on a machine for bleach
ing cloth. The operating of it was sim
ple, and he worked for two weeks without
accident. Then a finger was injured by
putting it in between a roll and a hot
cylinder in order to smooth the edge of
the cloth. For the period of six months
he had been at work on a machine quite
similar to this. The Supreme Court, in
reviewing the case, remarked: "In view
of the plaintiffs age and experience prlcr
to the time of the accident no duty then
rested with his employer to give him In
structions in reference to the risk of pos
sible injury. It could not be deemed
necessary at that time to tell him that
11 he should put his hand in between the
cloth and the revolving cylinder Just at
or Just before the place where the cloth
camÂ© in contact with the cylinder, there
was danger that his hand would be
caught."
Outside Instruction.
Another principle may be stated. If the
employer of a minor Is negligent. In not
instructing him, as hÂ© receives all needful
Information from other sources he has no
cause of complaint on this Bcore against
his employer. This rule was applied to a
boy by the courts of Minnesota. 'He was
employed to operate a carding machine in
a woolen mill. There were about forty of
these machines In the room where he was
set to work. The foreman told him to see
what the other operators did and he was
put in charge of five machines. Having
been injured by not keeping his shirt
sleeves out of the clutch of a machine he
sued his employer to recover for the in
jury. He claimed that his employer gave
him no instructions how to do his work,
yet admitted that he knew how to do It
through watching others. They told him,
among other things, to keep his shirt
sleeves rolled up to prevent them from
getting- Into the rollers. He testified tbat
he "did not know that it would alfo pull
in his arm, and did not know but that he
could Jerk his sleeve out." _ "It Is utterly
inconceivable," said the court, "that a
boy of his age supposed that the precau
tion was intended merely for the protec
tion of his shirt and not of his person."
After declaring an employer's duty to
give needful Instructions to youthful em
ployes the court adds: "No duty rests
upon a master to notify even a minor of
the ordinary risks and dangers of hig oc
cupation, which the latter actually knows
and appreciates, or which are so open and
apparent that one of his age and capacity
would, under like circumstances, by exer
cise of ordinary care, know and appre
ciate/'
Positions Which Children Cannot Fill.
Signaling.
There are positions which boys are in
competent to fill and for. which they ought
not to be employed. To employ them,
therefore, for such places is dear neÂ«li
fence on the part of their employers, ren
erinp them liable to other employes who
may -be injured through their lncompe
tency. In one of the cases requiring the
application of this principle a boy 14
years old was employed to signal an en-
Blneer_who ran an engine that' was used
fii unloa'dlng coal in a vessel. There were
men In the vessel who filled buckets with
coal and attached them to a rope, and
when they were ready the boy gave the
signal to the engineer to draw them up.
An accident having happened to one of
them through the boy's neglect or ineffl
ciency he sued the coal company, claiming
that it was negligent In employing th*
boy for such work. The court, remarked
that "no usage Xo employ boys of tender
years to perform, duties Involving the per
sonal safety of others, which require
Judgment, discretion and care greater
than is usually possessed by boys of suca
age, can be upheld for a moment." The
principal Question In the case was, Did
the company knowingly employ a. boy In
competent to do such work? and the court
of review thought the company was guil
ty. "The duty of giving the hoisting sig
nal to the engineer required the exercise
of a good degree of judgment and discre
tion and constant care and watchfulness.
It Is common knowledge that while a boy
of 12 or 13 years of age may possess and
be capable of exercising these qualities
yet a large percentage of such boys do not
possess them, or are not capable of exer
cising them continuously." That the boy
employed by the coal company to give
the signal was properly qualified was not
clearly proved oy Â¦ the fact that . he had
performed the duty In a proper way for
a week;Â«ac$^fifti3&gP*BM&s
. In another case a boy not 14 years old
was employed in a quarry to repeat to
trie engineer the signal given to him by
workmen. One â¢ of them havinz - been
killed through the boy's negligence his
wlfo tried to show that the company was
negligent in employing a boy to do such
work. The court thought otherwise. The
work had always been performed- by boys,
and this one had frequently acted in this
way before, as the unfortunate man knew.
So she failed In her case.
Telegraphing.
An Interesting case has been decided by
the Supreme Court of the United States
relating tc the employmtnt of a telegraph
operator 17 years old by a railway com
pany. ".The tenth night after he went to
work he submitted himself to the charms
of , sleep, 'with . the old result â a serious
accidentâ forgetful of the most familiar
truth that eternal vigilance Is the price of
safety. .The Judge told the Jury that boys
no ' older than he had successfully . dis
charged the duties of day. and night dis
patcher on the road in question and oth
ers, and that it seemed to have been the
custom of the company to educate its tel
egraph operators while serving as mes
senger boys. Nevertheless, the Jury found
that the company was i negligent in : em
ploying him. and the higher court did not
dlsturt their verdict.
Trapping-.
One other case, of an employe In a coal
mine, may be mentioned. A boy less than
15 years old was employed In' such a mine
as a -trapper.. This" consisted of opening
and closing; a door In a mine in obedi
ence, to a signal. - He was declared to be
competent for the purpose. The mine was
in Texas. " The - Supreme - Court of that
State said it was - a universal custom
among. owners and; companies working
mines to employ boys from 12 to 14 years
of age as . trappers. . and i that experience
had shown that they .were as efficient In
that sphere as older persons: at least that
their employment-was "practically satls-

â¢ THE EMPLOYMENT OF MINORS.
Rev. Dwight E. Potter Starts
' ; a Unique Missionary \
company.
Stockholders Hire a Missionary for
Foreijrn Landsâ Prospectus That
Discounts Oil Company
Descriptions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 25.
Rev. Dwight E. Potter of the Union
street Presbyterian Church has originated
an Interesting and entirely new scheme
for foreign missions. He has organized
what he calls "the Missionary Substitute
Company," and he is selling "stock" to
the members of his church. He says that
the preaching of the gospel In foreign
lands is a duty owed by all Christians,
and if it cannot be done in person it can
be done by employing a substitute.
The "company" is for the employment
of substitutes. Each "stockholder" pays
5 cents a month for each share of stock
that he holds. There are to be regular
meetings of the "company," to designate
when and where their missionary, will go,
and each "stockholder" has a vote lor
every share of stock held.
Here is the prospectus, .which rivals any
oil company prospectus in description:
The object of this company is to obey our
"marching 'orders." Christ wished the gospel
preachwi io all the world. He wishes It still.
HUs commands are our charter. 'â¢Â«> into all
the worldâ teach all nationsâ be my witnesses
unto the uttermost part of the earth." Mis
sionary work is therefore a matter of obedi
ence, not of opinion. Some cannot go; they
can send. Hence this Substitute Company.
Our assets are the promises of God to all
who obey him. These are a good bank account.
This bank will never break.
Our liabilities are heavy. . We are "debtors
to the wise and the unwise." We owe them
the gospeL As a church we are free from
debts â no more taxes, no interest, no mortgage.
Yet we are debtors to Christâ servants, wit
nesses. We must pray "Thy kingdom come"
and pay to bring it. The woVk is glorious. Our
opportunity is great. A friend offers $400 to
support one missionary if we raise $4C0 or.
tCOO for another, both to be oursâ chosen by
us, a part of us. our very own. They work
Â»hile we sleep. Help us to select them and
support them..
The dividends are lov*, Joy and peace â
blessing others and being blessed. Pleasing
Christ, obeying him, winning souls, treasure
laid up in heaven. Tou can trust the great
head of the company for the rest.
The capital stock is 2tXX> shares at 6 cents
eech per month. Would you really miss a
stamp a day, or a car fare a week? It would
greatly help us. Our friend, known as "Be
liever," subscribes for 664 snares; the rest is
for sale.
Twelve dated envelopes will be given you.
AH shareholders vote on the use of the funds,
choice of fields, etc. Five cents or more a
me nth makes you a shareholder. The secretary
e.nd auditing committee will consider private
all records of amount given.
â¢ We pledge money for rent, gas, . water, etc.
Why not for missions?
This is independent of all other missionary
societies of this church, and is not to in
terfere with any of them.
As the church committee, we ask for your
prayers that God may guide and use all. and
that there may be a full enrollment of stock
holders (about 250).
Will you not engage two names on the list
âone for your friend? Settle the amount with
the Lord and become a witness for Christ fcy
substitute "unto the uttermost."
Pledges are for the year 1901. to be renewed
if you are willing.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. Dec. 25.
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf has tele
graphed from Washington, that nothing
can be done toward getting an appropria
tion for the Oakland water front mto the
river and harbor bill until the investigat
ing engineers make an estimate of the
cost of the desired improvements. , jj
Unless this report reaches Washington
in time to have an amendment inserted
while the bill Is up before the House, Mr.
Metcalf, .j-ays he will have to make his
fight before the Senate Committee and
endeavor to have It inserted Into the bill
before it is sent back to the House., As
the bill row stands it contains no refer
ence to Oakland.
The Improvement asked for is of vital
and pressing Importance to this port. It
Is the deepening of the harbor to a mini
mum of twenty-five feet at low tide, so as
to allow the docklne of the large* t sea-,
going vessel!. Unless this Is done at once
great loss .will result to Oakland's ship
ping interests.
An important deal just consummated il
lustrates the sudden change taking place
along the water-front. This Is the award-
Ing of the contract for repairing the steel
revenue cutters Bear and Rush at the new
yards of Boole & Son at the foot of
Adeline street. There ' Is unprecedented
activity In shipbuilding all along the es

terday. ,At the time the ferry-boat left
Oakland there was a dense fog on the

started on the long voyage to Salvador.
She will be used towing lighters to and

by John Twigg & Sons. She Is com

Crew of Vessel Escapes Drowning by : Going Up
Town and Captain Just Saves Himself. ;
THE crew of the scow schooner C.
LÂ». Place had a narrow escape
from death yesterday . morning.
Up to a late hour Christmas eve
the crew of the schooner, six in
number, were busy loading her with coal.
The men were feeling Â«o good over Yule
tide that they energetically loaded the
boat down with sixty tons of coal where
ehe lay at the wharf at the foot of Beale
street About thirty tons of coal would
have been a good cargo, but the men de
cided that she could stand sixty and that
was an end of the matter, at least for
that night.
After being paid off the men decided
that they would have a time uptown. This
resolution saved their lives. They had
such a good time; that they forgrot the
bcow, and at 9:3') yesterday morning, in
the presence of the captain, "Black Ike,"
the owner, the boat, the C. L. Place, be
coming tired of her load, decided to go
out of business. She sprang- a leak and
rapidly sank. The captain was the only
one aboard and had just time to gather his
wardrobe and abandon the noble craft.
All day yesterday a crowd with melan
choly eyes viewed the masts that were
the only portions of the craft left above
water. The crew has not yet returned
and the members are still having a good
time. The scow will be raised to-day.

United States by the Inspector of Immi

to be taken J>ack to Victoria. Yesterday
he made a break for liberty and escaped
to the steamship State of California, ly
ing alongside, and attempted to bribe
fotne of the sailors on the steamer to hide
him. They refused, and the Â¦wily Jap
then .returned to the Senator, slipped
down the side cf the ship and started to
run up the Broadway wharf.
The customs inspector on duty ordered
Nature to halt, but this warnine only
made the Jap quicken his pace. The in-
Bpector fired four shots at the fast dis

effect of bringing the Jap to a halt. He
was taken back to the Senator nnd a

Thinks He's a Poached Egg.
Of all the crazy men with queer de
lusions there is none to compare with
that of an individual who is confined in
the Insane asylum in thin city, writes a
Kingston correspondent of the New York
Sun. He thinks he Is a poached egg, and
for twenty years he has been looking for
a piece of toast big enough to sit down
on. \\ hen visitors come and meet him
he always approaches- them with the re
quest for a moment's conversation In pri
vate. As he is perfectly harmless the
keepers do not put any restrictions upon
him. If you grant his request he whispers
In your ear:
"Have you got a piece of toast about
you?"
"No." you say. "What Is the matter
with you? Are you hungry?"
"Hungry!" ejaculates the man. "Why
should I be hungry? I have plenty to eat.
I'm tired. I'm a poached egg. and I'm
looking for a piece of toast to sit on."
Naturally this request leads to laughter,
and the poached egg retires In huge high
dudgeon, but he comes back regularly -on
the arrival of the next batch of visitors
to see if he can't have better luck. All
sorts of things which look like toasts have
,been supplied to the man. but he wants
the real thing, and as chairs and couches
are not made out of toasted -bread he is
obliged to go on making' his perpetual
plea to visitors. In all other respects the
man seems normal, and If this crazy Idea
could only be got out of his head he might
obtain his discharge. As he persists In
his delusion he will probably, spend the
rest of his days in the asylum.

The other day I attended the opening
of the, as yet, unref ormed Parliament of
Sark. says a writer in the London Daily
Mail. There is but one House, and |t 'a
called the Chefs Plaids. So far so good,
for I believe every sane political refiner
agrees that the model state should nave
one legislative body only.
But, alas, this single House is exclu
sively a .House of landlords, exclusively
a House of hereditary legislators. The
people of the island are not allowed to
elect their representatives. Land, alone
is represented; not wealth, nor Intellect,
nor the toiling masses, nor the submerged
tenth. And -the land ia represented in a

When the island, then uninhabited, was
granted in 1665 by Queen Elizabeth to
Heller de Oerteret. Lord of St. Ouen m
Jersey It was stipulated that he should
colonize it and should grant parts of it to
forty of tls retainers or followers as
copyholders or customary tenants under
him. It was also stipulated that these
tenants, though they might alienate their
holdings upon payment to the Lord of a
thirteenth of the value, might on no ac
count subdivide them. Thus there ara
still in the island the original, forty
estates, and the holder of each estate oc
cupies with regard to the seigneur, or
lord, almost exactly the same position as
a "leude" or a baron occupied in the old
feudal days of Normandy with regard to

it is certainly exasperating to realize that
j'ou have stubbed your toe on a genuine
gold brick and then were fool, enough
to walk off and let,, some other chap pick
It up. I had an experience of that kind
once myself. It occurred to me that a
revolving bookcase would be a handy
thing for office use and I had one built to
order. It proved a success and on several
occasions I thought vaguely of having the
device patented, but dismissed the scheme
as 'not worth while.' Nearly two years
afterward a more intelligent gentleman,
up in New England, did what I wouldn't
do and to-day he Is. rolling In riches. I
have been obliged to Duy one of his desk3

so badly in my, life.
Several other instances (in the same lino
have come under my personal observa

friend, for instance, who stumbled upon
the principle of the Bell telephone long
before the war. He waa at college at tho
time and he and a fellow-student actually
went so far as to construct an experi
mental line over half a mile long. Thev
had it In successful operation for several
weeks, when, it was discovered and de
stroyed by a cantankerous professor and
thus vanished what might have been one
of the biggest fortunes in the world. The
incident had- almo3t faded from my
friend's mind when Professor Bell
launched his invention on the public. An
other gentleman, who was formerly a
client of mine, anticipated- the pneumatic
tire years before somebody else patented
it. He Is fond of fine horses and away
back In the seventies he had a light road
cart made that was almost the exact
counterpart : of ' the modern pneumatic
sulky. The big, clumsy-looking tires ex

They . dubbed them 'sausage wheels,' and
I he has told me more than once that that
foolish joke was the Jthing which cause.l
him- to abandon the experiment. . Pneu
matic tires have since made half a dozen
big syndicates rich. Still another ac
quaintance figured out the exact mechan
ism of the self-binding reaper nearly ten
years before the machine was: covered by
patents. - Not being a - farmer he failed to
appreciate the Importance of the thing.
It impressed him as being chimerical and
he pigeonholed his drawings to rather
dust until he awakened to the fact that

Making Great Inventions.
Some Men Who Have Just Missed
BY A HAIR'S BBJEAI>TH.
The Challenge Is Out.
Wednesday, January the 2d, the great
challenge will take place in this city. â¢
The public did not know the true names
of these odd people. John and Mary they
were called and John and Mary were the
names . they always went by, except on
rare occasions
Th/si" landlady in the two-story wooden
bufi'rffeg at 641 Mission street knew them
as John Harrington and Ann Harrington,
and when the old woman was taken sick
a few days following Thanksgiving and
was removed to the Receiving Hospital
the name Harrington was booked in the
register. So when Mary died her identity
was not at the time disclosed. Absence
from her favorite haunts, however,
brought inquiry a* to her Â¦whereabouts
and then came the tidings of her death.
She had lived and died like a pauper, yet
after the end had come the hospital at
tendants found $500 in gold tied securely
to the lining of her cheap calico skirt.
She had saved It out of her meager earn
ingB and had hoped some day to live amid
HAPPY JOHN and ' contented
Mary, the silent pencil sellers,
have taken their last promenade
together along San Francisco's
busy thoroughfares. Poor Mary
Is dead, and John, her one-legged hus
band, la at the City Almshouse, where he
expects to spend the remainder of his life.
The passing of the couple from the dailv
life of this city removes two characters
that for many years have been objects of
much curiosity, sympathy and benevo
lence.
Ann's parents still reside in the old Bay
State and are reported to be Immensely
wealthy. . . â¢
Left to her own devices, Ann drank
more heavily. A few years ago. In one of,
her lowly haunts, she met Jack Harring
ton. Penniless, practically homeless and
together friendless, they joined; misfor
tunes for better or worseâ two earth-tor
tured human souls, hoping nothing, fear
ing nothing.
The woman was the daughter of a
wealthy Massachusetts maji. When 18 she
married, rather against her father s
wishes, a young man of roaming disposi
tion. -They came to California with a $10,
000 check as a wedding present. For a
while there was no happier home in Cali
fornia. Then Mary grrew harmfully fond
of alcoholic stimulants. A divorce fol
lowed, then separation from her child.
A strange characteristic of the silent
pencil sellers was the fact that they never
sought patronag-e; not even by a posture
would they endeavor to attract notice to
themselves and their needs. John always
took the outside. One leg is prone at the
knee â It was shot oft while he served his
country in the Civil war. In his right
hand he carried a cane, his left held the
pencils, the sale of which kept the wolf
from their door. Mary usually kept one
hand tucked under her husband's arm and
in this fa-shion they walked the streets or
stood on the . corner, silent and almost
motionless, waiting for whatever the fates
might bring.
the luxury- that had crowned her girlhood
days.
THE SILENT PENCIL SELLERS. WHOSE DAILY APPEARANCE IN SAN
FRANCISCO STREETS CEASED WITH THE DEATH OF MARY HAR
RINGTON AT THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL.
The Warden at Folsom is not criticized
for giving a hand to help an ex-convict
to make a new start in life, but it is as
serted that his Inclination to obliterate
the line between convicts and free men
tends to impair his strength as a disci
plinarian. The statement is made that
he was reprimanded by Warden Hale at
San Quentin for not observing: the rule
which requires that officers and convicts
should not dine together. If half the
stories told are true, the convicts at Kol
som are performing many responsible
duties which free men axe paid to
perform.
.The story is going the rounds that} the
Warden recently invited fan e'y-convict
named Howard to b6 his guest at Folcom.
Howard was doing time at San Quentin
when Mr. Wilkinson managed the com
missary department of that institution.
The convict's" cjus.:ificat:cr.s as a clerk
were utilized in keeping a record of the
receipt and distribution of supplies. A
short time ago Howard emerged from
San Quentin a free man. having served
the time of his sentence. The opportunity
to visit Warden Wilkinson at Folsom was
not neglected. According to accounts the
best entertainment afforded in the War
den's own house was freely tendered to
and enjoyed by the Warden's guest.
Moreover, a ticket to enable Howard to
go East by rail was purchased by War
den Wilkinson. It appears that Howard
went as far as Redding, and there tarried
to enjoy his freedom. The next thing that
happened was his arrest on a charge of
burglary.
Reports come from Kolsom to t h< ? ef
fect that officers of the prison are fre
quently tibeent. It is said that they often
visit San Francisco, and seldom make
haste to break away from the allurements
of city life. During their absence from
the Institution convicts are called In to
render service that should be performed
by free men. It is reported that one of
the officers', who has been away for a
week, was obliged to, rest for three days
after his return to Folsom In order to
gain strength and composure to attend to
his duties. | .
The lack of discipline at Folsom Prison
is said to be due in a measure to Warden
Wilkinson, who was formerly commis
sary at San Quentin.
Affairs relating to prison management
are freely discussed by members-elect of
the Legislature", the opinion being ex
pressed that official investigation will fol
low. It is said that Lieutenant Governor
Neff has resolved to select men of known
strength and ability for service on the
Prison Committee of the Senate.

FnmÂ» unknown cause and burned off part
of the roof. The entire building waft-bad

to risk their lives in useless endeavor.
An alarm from box 1SÂ«6 at 9 o'clock waÂ« !
followed five minutes latÂ«-r by a second j
Alarm, and for two hours the tiremen bat- |
tied to save the property.

The numbers 'of engine 1 responded quick

blaze broke into a hot Ore. The padlocked '
front door was broken down without cere- â¢
mony and an alarm was turned in. Dis- 1
trict Engine r \\i:ls..who was in charge,
ordered i::s men out of the siore, as they
Â¦were l>eir'K nvcrfoaie with smoke. I The
fiaacs pathered fzreat headway and with
in a few minutes there were explosions
and enough musketry tire to satisfy the j
most hardened soldi* r.
The liofct shafts in the sidewalk were â¢
smutched in by the Srenun and heavy !
streams r.f water were pourt-d Into the ;
cellar. The tlevator shatt was also used :
IX) ffoori purpose. The H::bson House, j
Â¦which is in-,m< iianiy above l^add's gun ;
â¢lore, was tilled with smoke and the lodg- i
Â«re hurriedly left the place. Holes werÂ«i ;
made in the flooring and streams were |
piayed en the flanus below.
The dense smoke which tilled the lodg- ;
irg-house nearly cauF?d loss of life. Many j
cf tlit- lodgers had " retired and were
aroused by the cries .of "fire:" and the ex- j
plosions. Fred Wiggin. who occupied ,
room 31. on the third floor, hurriedly don- j
red some clothes xind attempted to reach
a place of safety. He groped his way j
down the smoke-filled hall gasping for j
breath, and it was with the greatest dif- :
ficuity that he was able to escape. J. G. i
Brow and another man had also retired, !
and seciiig that it was impossible to et- i
Â«ape by the stairway hunted for the tire ,
escape. The red light Â«rulded them to it, Â¦
but on trying the door thev found it lock- .
ed. They tried to batter it down, but with
poor euecess. Their shouts and racket at
tracted the attention of a ttreman who
had ascended the fire escape, and he broke i
down the door with a heavy piece of wood '
Â£nd they made their way. to the street '
fcy means of the iron ladder outside the j
building.
Lieutenant Sayres of Chemical Engine !
No. 1 also had a narrow escape from as Â¦
phyxiatloti. -He was in the basement di- '
recting the efforts of his engine whe;i
he was overcome by the heavy smoke. 'Â¦
Two hcipemen carried the lieutenant up ;
the ladder to the street. He was very i
Â¦weak and in pain and had to be taken to '
a neighboring drug store and later to his
bane.
During the progress of the fire Edwin
H. Lada, proprietor of the gun store, ar
rived on the i^cene. His tirst thought was
cf the powder ttored in the front of tht
e*tablisnment. He knew that its pres
ence endangered the lives of the fire
fighters and he volunteered to enter the
store and carry the explosives out. Chief
Dougherty ha.l to peremptorily order the
plucky man from endangering hiti life.
\Vhon the lire was partially under control .
Ladd was not to be restrained. He
rushed into the place and soon returned
â¢with two cans filled with powder under
his arms. AH tho^e who saw the brave
act applauded hi? nerve.
Mr. Ladd estimated his stock to be va.
Â«f(3 at $20,000. He said it was destroye-1.
He admitted being insured for $5000. He
cannot account for the fire. His clerk,
L. E. Hall, had been In the store in the
morning and was the last one to leave the
place. Ke thinks it was started by the
cooking range in the neighboring restau
rant.
Another theory of the origin of the fire
Is put forth by Poiiceman Sullivan, who
Satrols the block in which the gun store
i located. He said that in passing the
etore an hour before the blaze he noticed
that a showcase filled with pistols and
other exhibits hud l.een pried away from
the wall and its contents were In danger
of boir.?? sti-len. He stood guard for a lit
tie while an<1 as he moved over the side
Â¦walk he received a terrible shock. Ht
said be was nearly lifted off his feet and
for a mom-vnt thought he had been struck
â¢with a club. He now believes that the
fire was started by a live wire and he has
hi* feelings to prove .his assertion.
The building 'is owned by the Hyman
Brothers. It wss damped to thÂ« extent
of $1000. The loss to tlie Hobson House,
vhfch is conducted by Messrs Hobson &
Klllgren. wiM amount to $S00. The Xew
Economy resteuranl 4s conducts by J.
nnd he places hie loss in the nelgh

'Oilef Dougherty believer the fire started
in the basement. He sÂ«y? his men report

nited by a .?park from the range.
