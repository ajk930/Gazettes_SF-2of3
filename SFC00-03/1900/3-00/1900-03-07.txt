FIFTY MINERS LOSE
LIVES IN AN EXPLOSION
Death's Awful Harvest in a
West Virginia Colliery,
CAPE TOWN, March 6. â Nearly the whole of the Dutch popu
lation of the Prieska and Kenhardt districts are in rebellion. Many
of the Dutch from neighboring districts are reported to have joined
them, notably Piet Moolman, who will lead the rebels to Brandbles.
Lucas Steinkamp, commanding the Boers, is reported marching on
Carnarvon. It is believed that Gordonia and Victoria West will
rise. It is thought that the total number of men in arms will
exceed 3000. The general opinion of loyalists is that a strong
force of British will be required as a reverse would spread the
rebellion.
LONDON. March 7.â There is import
ant news this morning from all the
fields of war. General Buller re
ports that Natal is practically
cleared of Boers, which points to
the probability that while a portion
cf General Joubert's burghers fell back on
La!nps Nek and Majuba the main bedy
crossed the Drakensbergr Mountains to aid
In resisting Lord Roberts. Many military
men find It hard to believe that the Boers
have abandoned their strong positions at
Elpgarsberg.
Facing Lord Rcberts there Is a constant
ly Increasing force of Boers, occupying,
according to various accounts, a front es
timated at from ten to eighteen miles in
length. The Boers whom General Frencn
ehelled and temporarily discomfited havÂ«J i
crossed the Modder River and now hold j
a position on its northern bank. Lord ]
Roberts' force, which also occupies both j
bank? of the river with a cavalry brigade i
on each wing, is waiting for ammunition
and supplies before advancing. Fighting
on a large scale is expectt-d shortly. Mean
time the commander in chief maintains a J
rigid silence regarding his movements.
Yesterday's news makes it clear that j
Cape Colony will soon be free from Boers, i
On all three lines on which the British
are working progress has been made, not
always by dint of hard fighting, but by
the gradual retreat of the Boers. General
Gatacre, who siijce h)5 disastrous attempt
has been occupying- himself atSterkstrooraJ
T.-!th occasional marcr.es to Cys3srjpi3 ana -
Molteno. advanced on Monday to Storm
berg and found the strong position there
vacated by the Boers. . >
Thelr retreat was accelerated by the ad
vance of General Brabant, who. starting
from Dordrecht with a force of about ISOO
men, attacked Labuschagnes Nek on Sun
day, and held the position when the day
closed. On Monday .the Boers retired,
taking their guns with them, and when
last heard of they were trekking fast In
the direction of Allwal North. Those re
treating from Stormberg, If they do not
make a stand at Burghersdorp, will
probably make their way to Bethulie.
Whether they will cross the frontier un- i
molested depends to some extent on the
operations of General Clements. Yester
day he was at Jouberts Siding, one sta
tion beyond Coresberg. As he now has
10.000 men, he is likely to make an attempt
to cut off their retirement. Thus the
three Boer forces which invaded Cape
Colony and seized Colesberg, Stormberg
and Dordrecht have all fallen back. They
have failed so far to combine, but in the
Free State they may effect a Junction.- In
each case the Boers managed to take
away all their guns, as they have done in
Northern Natal. Their skill in removing
these heavy pieces of ordnance is one of
the most remarkable achievements of the
war.
Further dispatches from Ladysmith
show that relief did not arrive a day too
soon. Mr. Treevee, a medical officer, has
telegraphed that on his entry into the
town he found its state deplorable. There
were no. loss thaji 800 cases, of typhoid
fever," and as the perioil of Incubation of
typhoid is two and sometimes three weeks
it is feared that there will be a great
many more cases among the garrison.
thoogh Lord Salisbury previous to last
Friday had not considered the . further
prolonging of Lord Pauncefote's term, he
apparently become Â¦so much Impressed
with ' the strength of . the arguments re
garding the " Embassador's acute knowl
edge of the matters pending between the
two nations that he asked him If he were
willing : to remain. . Lord Pauncefote re
plied in the affirmative.
Â« : No â¢ definite, period was mentioned by
Lord Salisbury, so It Is probable that the
dean of % the diplomatic . corps will not
leave Washington ' this year at : any .' rate.
At the end of a year the British Go vern-
ment hopes for a settlement of the vari
ous controversies.
No communications of any kind have
passed ..between the two Governments In
regard to Lord Pauncefote. and not even
any unofficial -Intimation was given to
Lord Salisbury by any -representative of
the United States that Lord Pauncefote's
retention would be .acceptable to the
American administration.

YOKOHAMA, March 6.â No one of
the legation In Toklo nor any of the
Japanese officials will acknowledge
that war with Russia is imminent,
and it Is well, known in diplomatic
circles that at present Japan and Russia
are working secretly to obtain concessions
in Korea against other nations; but this
does not mean that a clash between Rus
sia and Japan Is not coming In the future.
Japan is the only serious obstacle In the
way of Russian Eastern policy. Japan
must have Korea, which already is flood
ed with Japanese coolies, who. are really
soldiers. /
Â¦Russian transports pass through Naga
saki constantly laden with troops for Port
Arthur. The Japanese common people
have a great hatred for Russia and
would welcome war without counting the
cost: but they have little power. Japan
has not money for war and Russia will
vleld to Japan so long as the trans-Si
berian railroad is Incomplete. An Ameri
can engineer. who has been over the road
reports that it cannot be used effectively
for nine months.
* Rumors of an impending war originated
In Shanghai, - not In Japan, and were
based on generalizations, not on facts.
Russia Is now changing her representa
tives throughout Japan. %nd would not do
so if she expected an immediate outbreak.
As during the last three years a crisis
resulting in war might arise at any mo
ment; but for the present It Is not at
hand, and in my opinion Russia can pre
vent it until she Is ready.

LORD ROBERTS'
LATEST REPORT
LONDON, March Câ The War Office has
received the following dispatch from Lord
Roberts:
"Osfonteln. March 6.â General Gatacre
occupied Stormberg yesterday. The lines
of railroad north and west will now be
repaired. General Clements is at Jou
bert's elding station, beyond Colesberg.
The Duke of Marlborough, with the Ox

BOERS ENTRENCHING
AND MOUNTING GUNS
LONDON, March 7.â A dispatch to the
Dally News from Modder River, dated
Monday. March*s, and describing the Boer
position In front of Lord Roberts, says:
"The Boers seem to like to be so busy
entrenching. They have mounted eight
guns on high kopjes. It Is marvelous how
they drag these weapons Into such posi
tions. It is reported here that at a recent
emergency meeting of the Free State
Raad, at Bloemfonteln, a radical differ
ence of opinion developed, the majority
favoring peace at any price, but the mi
nority, including President Steyn, advo
cating a fight to the end."
MONTEREY MAN KILLED.
MONTEREY. March 6.â News comes

which Is being promoted among the
supporters of the Government in
the House of Commons continues to re
ceive signatures. The signatories of the
memorial to Mr. BaJfour affirm that the
time has arrived for plain speaking Inside

Salisbury's words are construed into a
pledge against annexation, and Lord Rob

confiscation of Boer property.
The Transvaal agency at Brussels
threatens a rising of the Cape Dutch in
the event of annexation, though why the
Dutch should rise then rather than now
is not explained.

party In less than an hour, bat they met
greater difficulties after that time. It was
then that telegrams were sent to Mont
gomery. Charleston and other places for
physicians . nurses and caskets, but dur
ing the greater part of the day there was
use only for the caskets.
All work was stopped In the surround
ing mines of the district and the people
within a radius of many miles assembled
on the grounds of the Red Ash Company.
As the victims Were brought to the sur
face and carried away on the hastily con
structed stretchers it was frequently no
ticed that many met their husbands,
fathers, brothers and sons among the res
cuers when they thought these men were
In the mines. The meetings between the
men who had not yet entered the mines
and their families were very touching. AH
those who could not find their friends In
the crowd assumed that they were In the
Inclosed mines.
Grief of the Relatives.
The population of the mining village Is
only 1500. AH are miners and very many
of them are related and they all know
one another. There was great distress all
day among those who could not find their
friends or hear from them. As Tliunnond
Is only three miles from the scene of the
disaster there were some few in the mine,
who lived at that place, but for the most
part the victims resided here, and the
calamity will reach almost every little
house in the mining town. None of the
people here have been at their homes dur
ing the day, but all have remained around
the Red Ash mine. Some have not eaten
during the day. Food was liberally sup-,
plied to the relays of workmen in the res-,
cuing party, but many of the women who
could get no word of comfort refused to
eat or go to their homes.
At a late hour to-night the most relia
ble estimate obtainable put the number
of victims at fifty. The capacity of tho
mine is 173. but there have "been only 130
on the payroll so -far this month, and it
is said that less than half of these were In
Â¦ the mine at the time of the explosion.
The manager, superintendent, bosses,
bookkeepers and others aro very busy
with the force of .rescuers, but at the
same time they are all very reticent a a
to. the extent of the . casualties and any
other information regarding the disaster.
Awful Sights Witnessed.
The scenes around the homes where tho
bodies are lying to-night have drawn some
of the Immense crowd away from the
workmen at the entrance of the mine.
Those working on the rescue relays say
that the scene becomes more terrible as
they get farther Into the mine.
Bodies that cannot be Identified or
recognized have been placed In tho
large . blacksmith shop of the Red
Ash Coal Company, and that place
presents the appearance of a horrible
morgue. Although the bodies are man
gled beyond recognition, they are sur
rounded by those who are in distress and
hunting their lost friends.
The general belief is that the explosion
occurred from contact with dust when
the miners entered, this morning with
their lights, and that it was not due to
fire damp, as had been currently reported
all day. Nearly all the men employed In
the mine were white, only about one-fifth
being colored, and most of the men were
married, and had families in the little cot
tages near the tipple of the great mine.
A special train arrived from Montgom
ery at 7 o'clock to-night, filled with re
porters, physicians, nurses and others,
and one car contained thirty caskets.
After the arrival of the train, an order
was sent back to Montgomery for fifty
more caskets. Another train arrived from
Charleston with physicians, caskets and
relief supplies. Still another train came
In frorn-'Hlnton. but there Is no need of
physicians and nurses, as evidently all of
the vicUins are dead. The work of rescue
is being continued during the night and
will be kept up until the mine is clear.
FIRE CREEK. W.. Va.. March 6.â
The most disastrous mine explosion
ever known in the New River dis
trict occurred at the Red Ash
'mine shortly after the miners went
to work early this morning. Although
the most heroic work of the rescuing
party has been going on incessantly all
day, it Is Impossible to-night to estimate
the full extent of the loss of life and prop
erty. . . -
Ten bodies have already been taken out,
and the total number of victims will
reach fifty. There Is little hope for those
still In the mine, and who number at least
forty. The cause of the explosion can
only.be conjectured, but it is believed to
have resulted from dust, as was. the case
in a Pocahontas mine some years ago.
The Re.d Ash mine is a large drift, and
the explosion occurred near the entrance,
which was thus closed by the falling
slate, entombing a large number of
miners. The scene of the disaster is be
tween this place and Thurmond, on the
south branch of the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad. J. Fred Efflnger of Stan
ton, W. Va.. is the principal owner of the
mine.
Relief parties from great distances ar
rived as soon as possible. State Mine In
spector Plnckney, with a corps of ex
perts, has been on the ground during the
day rendering all assistance possible and
devoting his attention more toward re
lief than to an official investigation as
to the cause of the disaster.
Rescue Work Impeded.
The managers and bosses of all the
mines in this district came to the scene
and joined in the work of rescue, but they
were greatly impeded by the extent of
the enormous blockade at the entrance to
the drift. The large . side tiers of the
entrance were blown out, together with a
lot of heavy timbers. Even -mules were
hurled some distance. The force of such
an explosion caused an immense falling
of slate and other debris, so that the en
trance was filled. As many men as could
work at one time were digging away with
all their might, and these were relieved in
short relays ; by, other men, so as to ex
pedite the . work as much as possible.
t The first successful strike of the rescu
ers was at 10 a. m... when ten men were
recovered. Seven of them were already
dead and the other three were dying.
As the miners had fallen at different
places in the drift, and the explosion had
caused the falling slate to blockade the
rooms In different parts of the mine, the
work of rescue met one. great obstruction
after another. The men reached at 10
a. m. were not far from the entrance,
while others were at much greater dis
tances within the drift.
At the mouth of the mine the scene
was heart-rending. The wives and chil
dren and neighbors of those who were
known to be entombed were there in full
force and their distress was pitiable.,
While they were all seeking to help those
who were rescued and to get the mine re
opened, yet these bereaved people were
for the most part in the way of the res
cuers and had to be held back from the
entrance.
Fail to Pump in Air.
The mine is one of the largest in West
Virginia and was very heavily timbered
In the different drifts. It was for this
reason at once feared that those who had
not been killed by falling debris at the
time of the explosion were pinioned by
these connected timbers and might suf
fer death from' suffocation. Air was
forced into the mine by engines on the
surface, which were kept working after
the explosion, but it was found that air
could be pumped into the drift for only a
short distance, .as the coal, stone and
earth shut off all avenues. The pumps
and all other machinery in the mine were
demolished so that everything had to be
done through temporary arrangements on
the surface.
After the men got under headway In
the work of rescue they reached the first

DEATH ENDS THE TRANCE
OF MI SS ELI DA W I LB UR
After Two Years of a Deep Sleep, From Which the Efforts
of a Score of Physicians Gould Not Wake Her,
She Passed Quietly Away. V
MISS ELIDA WlfcBUR, WHOSEISIiEEP ENDED;IVITH HER LIFE.
mISS ELIDA WILBUR, who " for
two years lay unconscious to all
her surroundings, baffling the
constant attention and efforts of
skilled physicians, passed to the great be
yond yesterday morning. She died at her
mother's home, 2228 California street,
never having regained consciousness since
the fateful day when she was found part
ly asphyxiated by gas.
Full of sad and pathetic incidents are
the last few years of Miss Wilbur's life.
A young girl In the bloom of life, beauti
ful of face and figure, courted by her
many friends and one of the most popular
young women in society, she was cut off
from the world by a single and fearful
stroke of blighting misfortune. When the
which marred her life and re
sulted ultimately in her death occurred,
she was the betrothed of James Dunphy.
the only son of one of California's
wealthiest cattle men. Â¦ From prospects of
a glowing, and happy future she was sud
denly launched into a world of darkness
and all the blessings of nature and the
happiness of her social life gave place to
a misery as complete and perfect as is
visited upon mortal being. y
A Living Death.
The 'accident which made Miss Wilbur
the "living dead" for over two years hap
pened on the evening of February 16, 1803.
She and her betrothed James Dunphy. had
been visiting a mutual frtend. Returning
to the young lady's home at an early
hour, Mr. Duriphy did > not leave for some
little time after. "It was rumored- at" the
time that the lovers had quarreled, and
that he left the house unreconciled and de
termined to break the engagement exist
ing between them. The next morning Miss
Wilbur was found sitting In a large, easy
chair -In her room. A< gas Jet was open
and she was in 'a 'state of complete un
consciousness. : "Â¦Â¦' Â¦- : ' ':. ' : .
The circumstances and conditions of ithe
case scouted the idea or theory rof at
tempted suicide. .'A window 'in the room
was wide, open and. Miss Wilbur's posi
tion, recumbent, and, a book . which s she
had been reading having -fallen at her
side were evidences of accident. â¢ It was
supposed 'that \ the \ light was ' blown , out
by the draught coming!. through. the open
window. .The next morning. Mr. ; Dunphy
visited Miss Wilbur with an intent to es
cort her to Oakland, where she was going
to attend the funeral of a friend. J
Baffled Medical Skill. . ; .
From February 16, 1898, to the time, of
her. death over forty physicians had- been;
called In to attend Miss Wilbur at. one
tlmeor. other. Work as they would, pre-,
scribing every treatment known. to. medU
cal science,, their efforts were of no ."avail.
Specialists with reputations, national in
character took charge of Miss Wilbur; but
success did' not follow. .Varying , diag
noses were made, each physician being al
lowed a sufficient, time to prove or dis
prove the worth of his prescribed - treat
ment. Â»â¢Â» â¢ :*.: * . - .Â¦â¢Â¦'
.Although unconscious, the patient was
not : insensible to pain. When suffering
physical agony she gave way to a spasm
of weeping and when relief came she was
instantly quiet and composed. During, all
this time of unconsciousness Miss Wilbur
was without the power of locomotion or
muscular articulation. At times there
were no indications in her face of- her
great mental disorder. Her eyes were
bright,.' her features composed and the>
expression that marked hqr countenance
was; that of a being with mind and.rea
son. Then 'there would come a sudden
change, and she would lapse Into a par
alytic condition.
' ' During the day the eyes were open at
will.' Nourishment, which was always in
.liquid form,' was administered through a
â¢ tube, that ran into the aesophagus. Until
' two days ago, when Miss Wilbur began to
weaken, she was apparently in compara
tively, good '; health.
She Never Waked.
i The story -that Miss Wilbur regained
consciousness a few days ago and uttered
in a ; semi-delirium, "Nobody to love me,"
,1s emphatically denied by all persons who
have been in constant attention since she
was stricken down. . . â¢
..; The funeral .will be on Thursday morn
ing, no arrangements other than the time
set- having .been made. A- score or.two
physicians ( are anxious for an autopsy,
but Mrs.' Logan, the young lady's mother,
is averse to it.

GENERAL WHEELER WENT

General Joseph Wheeler spent Monday
night, yesterday and last night at the
quarantine station on Angel Island, where
he and his fellow-passengers from the

He may be allowed ashore to-day, and It
may be two days more before he 13 let
go, but he cannot complain, for It ia the
general's own fault.
As reported along the water front yes
terday., the truth of it is that when the
Warren stopped at Honolulu the general
decided he would go ashore, despite the
fact that Honolulu is still under the baji
of the plague. ( He and several of his
party went through the military camps,
through the city, and to several other
places of Interest. He was ashore two or

Father Yorke Discusses Vice
of Divorce and Duties
of Matrimony.
â¢ A most Interesting and elevating address
was delivered last evening at St. Mary's
Cathedral by Rev. Peter C. Yorke. His
subject was "Marriage and Divorce." The
lecture was listened to attentively by an
audience that filled the auditorium of the
big cathedral and overflowed into the gal
leries. In his discourse the eloquent
speaker drew the conclusions that every
family should be Independent within it
self; that the marriage contract should
be between but one man and one woman,
and that it should last until the termina
tion of the life of at least one of the par
ties thereto. Briefly, Father Yorke said:
"Man Is composed of three elementsâ
the body, the soul and the spirit. Between
the body and the soul is a continual con
flictâthe conflict between the higher and
the lower, man. The soul . desires those
things which the body does not.; To-night
I â will discuss the man as a member, of
the family and. the conflict which exists
i within him between the'body.on one side
and the spirit on the other. Naturally,
we would expect to find the soul on ' the
spirit's side. Theoretically, : It is on . the
side of crae*. but practically It is on the

veys. is brought Into the world in the
most helpless condition; and is the slow
est of all ; the members of the .animal
kingdom In reaching his maturity. Hence
the marriage contract should not be fleet
ing, but should be stayed. If It Is entered
Into for the good of the children. It should
last as long as they, do and exist through
out the whole human life. The contract
is not only for the man and the woman
who enter into it, but for the helpless
little ones they bring Into the world.
America's Greatest Vice.
"Polygamy is the first revolt of the
body against the unity of the family." And
then there is the polygamy on the Install
ment plan, which becomes possible by
reason of our divorce laws."
Father Yorke made a scathing refer
ence to the childless couples. "This is a
vice," he said, "in which man and woman
defeat' the ends -for which the marriage
state was designed and live only for their
own pleasures. The Roman ; empire was
rotted out by just such vice." He said
the distaste for children was spreading at
an alarminig rate, until it had become
"America's greatest vice."
"The Episcopalians have' tried to stop
divorce by, urging society to frown upon
divorced people," he continued. . "Society
cannot rise above Its source. Some class
might close its doors against the divorced,
but you will find enough divorced people
to form a society of their own. The mis
ery, that divorce essays to heal la a mis
ery that grows upon us. , - *^
"Unless we have true men and true wo."
men. we cannot, have a great nation. The
polygamy of the Mormon and the divorce
of the American must be destroyed If we
expect; the upbuilding of the , Christian
home and the sustaining of the nation."
This evening Father Yorke â¢ will discuss

tone, remarked that It cost a trifle for de
tectives to dig up such testimony, which
brought forth . the sarcastic reply from
McEnerney that it cost about as much as
transportation to Chicago and hotel bills
for witnesses.
Pence hotly replied that objection to the
question and all similar ones would be
withdrawn if the other side would file a
report of their detective account. After
a little bantering the court adjourned In
order that the deposition of W. W. Foote
might be completed.

Miss Jennie Flood Home Again.
Miss Jennie Flood arrived home yester
day from an extended tour of the East
and Europe. She was met at the Oakland
mole by Mr. and Mrs. James L. Flood
and by Major Rathbone, who had trav

escort her to her home. It Is expected

unexpected departure was turned to mer
riment. Dispatches were sent to promi

and others of his kind, "to arrest one
Horace Platt. believed to have suddenly

The authorities of the- Southern Pacific

passengers like John Rosenfeld to gazo
on his solitary grandeur. On one stretch
of the road, where the scenery Is excep
tionally fine, he allowed ladies to come
Into the car for observation purposes.
IT is not at all surprising that a bril
liant function like the Mardl Gras ball,
of the San Francisco Art Association"
should vanish and fade away in a
beautiful afterglow. It is to be re
gretted, however, that the serenity of
the glow, should be marred by personali
ties, and that orie fepresentative of so
ciety should in resentment -of a real or
fancied slight place a gross indignity upon
the beverage of another representative of
the elite.
! The story goes that Addison Mizner
made a request for an Invitation to the
carnival, which the committee either
overlooked or denied. Presumably the In
vitation was for a friend, as It can hardly
be imagined that Mizner himself should
be denied the privileges of the function.
Whatever the grievance was, Mr. Mizner
fancied that E. M. Greenway, hero of a
thousand quadrilles and a two-step cham
pion of local renown, was the power that
prompted the refusal of the invitation.
The Mizner grievance grew as the after
glow deepened, and he resolved to make
the leader of the Four Hundred feel the
sting of Mlzner's resentment. . He re
solved further that the wrong or slight
should be redressed, as .soon as he met
Greenway face to face. Days elapsed be
fore the meeting took place, as Green
way was busy receiving congratulations
upon the wonderful success of the grand
march and other features of the carnival,
but they met before even the surface of
the Mizner. wrath had cooled. The meet
ing took place in a fashionable cafe.
Happily there was no bloodshed; so so
ciety and even the fair sex of society
may read of what happened without dan
ger of the shudders. The Mizner glance
caught the Greenway formâ the lovely
rotund form which the buds adore. It
was observed by the holder of the griev
ance Vhat the society leader was quaffing
beerâ plain, ordinary beer. It was notea
that the boon companions of the leader
of society were drinking beer. The na
ture of the beverage surprised Mizner.
but the surprise did not swerve him from
the . purpose In mind. Mizner acted
promptly to redress his real or imaginary
wrongs.-vbut he acted deliberately.
Not desiring to create a scene or pro
voke an uproar in a public place he strode
deliberately across the room to the table
where Greenway dat. placed his mouth
near the unquaffed beer in the glass be
fore Greenway and taking deliberate aim
spat in the beer that Greenway was in
the act of drinking. The aim of the
Mizner was true. There was no miscal
culation of distance. Without the aid of
.a range-finder he ascertained the curve
at the first fire. A professional spitter
this is my wife,' and I stepped out."
The witness was then turned over to the
other side and cross-examined. Thomas
explained that he was retired from the
Chicago police force on account of having
been wounded in a street fight with a
burglar while on duty, and in answer to a
question denied having received the injury
In the Clan na Gael trouble. ' He admitted
being under pay as a witness, valuing his
time at J5 per day, his hotel expenses and
transportation.
Attorney Pierson questioned Captain
Thomas closely on the remark made by
Senator Fair when Mrs. Craven-Fair was
ushered to his room, and Â¦ got completely
tangled when pinned to the exact lan
guage whether the Senator had said Miss
or Mrs! Craven. When asked if he did not
think lit queer that In a strict hotel the
Senator's wife was called a Miss and did
not bear his name. . witness â¢ shyly re
marked that he did not think -anything
queer in a hotel. ; Â¦
Thomas next told of his arrangements
made for his services as a witness: "I
met Mrs. Craven-Fair by appointment last
JanuarY In Chicago, and when I told her
that I remembered the meeting with Sen
ator Fair, negotiations - were closed at
once." Â¦ '
Some rather delicate questions by Attor
ney Pierson regarding Thomas' past life
met with a strong objection, which was

traitor to reason In bringing about a com

Society's First Form.
"We are all dependent one upon the
other. It is not well for man to be alone.
In all walks of life we are compelled to
depend upon the exertions of our fellows,
and the more complex civilization grows
the greater becomes this dependency.
"Social instinct in man is naturalâ Jt la
part of his makeup. His happiness de
pends upon how much he can make others
contribute to his wants. Society has two
forms, the tamlly and the civil state. Tha
first form societj; takes is the family.
Both exist on their own merits; both are
independent of the other.
"There is much loose speaking and much
loose thinking about marriage. It is a
contract. Sometimes we read in the news
papers that it is a contract, and again
that it is something that should be. done
in the 'good old Scotch Presbyterian way.'
"The duty which devolves upon those'
Â¦who enter Into the marriage relation Is to
rear . families and bring up their children
In the proper way. The old : maxhn ' that
'every man's home Is his castle' â¢ empha
sizes the fact that the first necessity. of
every family is to be* independent; one
not to interfere with the other."
Interference in the Family.
The speaker went on to exemplify this
by the assertion that upon no matter, is a
marv more sensitive than interference with
his Rimlly affairs. , ' Â¦
Father Yorke argued strongly against
polygamy, stating that if nothing els-*
could be said- against it the fact that a
man had all he could do to I take proper
care of one family was sufficient. He said
the function of the husband .-was not
thoroughly understood; that some consid
ered his duty ended when he provided
bread- and shelter for those dependent
upon. him.
â¢ "This is not ' the true condition,'.' con
tinued Father Yorke. "He should not only
be the breadwinner of the family, but the
friend, protector and guide of his children.
It Is well known that the bad example of
a wicked or careless husband counteracts
all the good the mother. can do,. even If
she wears her fingernails down to the

Morgan J. Thomas, who was chief de

WITHHOLDING TRUTH
When the hearing of Mrs. Craven-Fair's
petition for a family allowance from the
Fair estate was resumed before Judge
Troutt- yesterday morning Mrs. Cosack
was put on the stand for further cross
examination by Attorney Pierson. While
she adhered to her original story, the law

she made her deposition in the case of
Angus vs. Craven she had an interview
Â¦with D. M. Delmas, In which he. advised

She resented the insinuation that she
A Pair of Mrs. Craven-Fair's Prize Witnesses.
The Attorney, Upon Arrival From
Mexico, Flees to His Home in
Fear of Sylva and the Fairs.
LOUIS F. DUXAXD. the attorney
upon whom Mrs. Craven-Fair
placed v so much reliance to back
up her story of the Sausalito cere
mony and to shatter the conspiracy yarn
of Adolph Sylva, has returned from Mex
ico and Bays he is prepared'to substanti
ate the statements of the alltged widow
v{ the late Senator Fair.
He arrived at his home at San Rafael
Â«"arly yesterday . morning, accompanied
by City Attorney Thomas P. Boyd.
Boyd met Dunand on the Aca-
Jiulco yesterday morning and in a
launch the two evaded all inquiries and
went to Tiburon. where they caught the
Crrt train to San Rafael. Boyd says that
Mrs. Dunand requested him to meet her
husband, as she was extremely nervous
and apprehensive that Dunand. might fall
into the hands of Adolph Sylva or the Fair
heirs. Dunand, on his arrival at San Ra
fael, went straight to his hoiue and de
tied himself to visitors until late last
evening. When questioned in regard to
his Mexican trip Dunand ridiculed the
Idea that his Journey had any connection
with the Cravea-Fair case.
"My trip was purely a business one,"
he said, "made In the interest of a local
construction company. It had nothing
whatever to do with securing testimony."
Â¦While admitting the existence of con
tracts between Mrs. Craven-Fair and him
self. Dunand professes Ignorance as to the
particular one to which she referred In
her testimony.
"There are several documents existing
between Mrs. Fair and myself," he stat
ed. "It would not be. fair to her to di
vulge the contents of any of them until
after a consultation with her attorneys."
Dunand gave the following account of
his transactions with Mrs. Craven-Fair:
"I want it to be understood," he said,
â¢that our relations from first to last have
bten purely friendly. The first time I
went to Sausalito with her I was sent by
Mr. Foote. She stated to him that she
had be-en married to Senator Fair in Sau-
Falito by a justice whose name she had
forgotten. I believed her story to be
true."
"Do you believe In it still?" was asked.
"I do implicitly," he replied. "I intro
duced Mrs. Craven-Fair to Adolph Sylva
and there my connection with the case
practically ended. Within the next day
or two Sylva and Mrs. Craven-Fair met
In my office. Sylva said that if he was to
act in Mrs. Fair's interest he must have
a retaining fee. She gave him an order
drawn on Daniel Meyer for $200. I had
â¢several interviews with her and Sylva af
ter that, but nothing was said having any
bearing on the present case. I cannot say
more now. but when I am called upon to
testify I will tell the whole truth," con
tinued Dunand.
"How will that affect Mrs. Craven-
Fair's testimony?" was asked.
"I beiieve that my (statements will cor
roborate her story In every. essential par
ticular," he replied.
When questioned as to his opinion of
Adolph Sylva's pose as a champion of
truth and exposer of conspiracies, Dunand
Fhrugged his shculders and remarked that
"Sylva was a poor judge of the perspicu
ity of human nature."
A "dark horse" in the case Is Walter A.
Frost of New York, who traveled up on
th<9 steamer with Dunand from Panama.
Just wnat Frost's business Is is a mystery,
but he is supposed to be Interested in thÂ«
case as one of thÂ« witnesses to substan
tiate Sylva's etory. Sylva denied abso
lutely all knowledge of the man. Dunand

could ;not shave done a : piece of
work. Then Mizner .turned one glance of
ferocity on the leader of. the Four Hun
dred and majestically strode away.
Greenway was * paralyzed. Recovering
his presence of mind he ordered more bter
in another glass. The onlookersâ Parrish.
Runyon and othersâ expected that the
hurry-up wagon would soon be summoned,
but the expected did not happen. Green
way mused, as only one accustomed to
musing can muse, land then went outsidu
and drank in a large breath of fresh air.
Then he- exclaimed. "The little puppy,"
and vanished -n the gloaming.
Meanwhile Mizner awaited results. Hold
ing in reserve his temper and saliva, ho
was ready to meet the shock of conflict.
He is still waiting.
Various are the comments made by the
Four Hundred. In one set of the smart
people it is contended that Greernvay
should have waited until Mizner ordered
a drink and then retaliated by spitting in
the beverage provided for quenching the
Mizner thirst. Others maintain that
Greenway, as the leader of a wine agency,
could not afford to resent an Insult placed
on > beer, and that the society leader de
served the rebuke for drinking beer in
stead of wine. , . . Â¦
The beauty of the afterglow of the car
nival is marred by these conflicting' opin
ions. '.The code does not state explicitly
what action a wine drinker should pursue
when he is insulted in the act of drinking
beer, hence society has something to talk
about and something to suggest. After
Lent the code of ethics may be amended.

ADVEBTISEIffENTS. ;
ONLY A SUGGESTION,
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense would suggest that If
one wishes to become fleshy and plump
It can only result from the food we eat
and digest and that food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
*ggrs, beefsteak and cereals; In other
words the kinds of food that moke flesh
are the foods which form the greater
part of our daily bills of fare.
. But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally too much, the
etomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not properly digest and assimilate it,
which is the reason bo many people re-
main thin and undÂ«>r weight: the diges-
tive organs do not completely digest the
flesh forming beefsteak and eggs and
similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such who are
really confirmed dyspeptics. although
they may have no particular pain or in-
convenience f.rom their stomachs.
If such persons would, lay their preju.-
dices aside and make a regular practice
of taking, after each meal, one or two
of Stuart's Dyrpepsla Tablets the food
would be quickly and thoroughly digest-
ed, because these tablets contain the nat-
ural peptones and diastase which every
weak etomach lacks, and by supplying
this want the 6tomach Is soon enabled to
regain its natural tone and vigor. Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest every
form of flesh-forming food, meat, eggs,
bread and potatoes, and this is the rea-
son they bo quickly build up, strengthen
and invigorate thin, dyspeptic men,
women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
delicate, use them with marked . benefit
as they contain." no ' strong:, Irritating
drugs, no cathartio nor any harmful In-
gredient. "
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the most
successful and most widely known of any
remedy for stomach troubles because they
are the most reasonable and scientific of
modern medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
every druggist In the United States and
Canada as well as In Great Britain, at 50
cents for complete treatment. .
Nothlr.g further Is required to cure any
stomach trouble or to make thin, nerv-
ous. dyÃpcptlc people strong, plump and
well. ?.,-. .

PACIFIC CABLE
BILL BROUGHT
TO THE FRONT
Favorable Reports Ordered
by Committees of Senate
and House.
Â«
One Provides for Government Owner
ship and the Other for Private
Construction of the
Line.
. WASHINGTON. March 6â The Senate
Committee on Naval Affairs to-day or
dered a favorable report upon the bill to
construct a cable to Manila by way of
Honolulu, Midway Islands and Guam. It
1s to bo under the direction of the Navy
.Department, and la to be. a Government
.cable.
Hale, chairman of the committee, was
nuthorized to prepare a bill and report It
to the Senate. The bill will provide for
immediate construction of the cable from
San Francisco to Honolulu only, but it
contemplates an ultimate extension to the
Philippines and also to Honpkong. It Is
estimated that the cable to Honolulu will
cost between $3jDOQ.OM and W,<\<o.tK'Q.
The House Committee on Commerce to
day ordered a favorable report on the bill
for a Pacillc cable connecting this coun
try with Hawaii, the Philippines and Ja
pan. The measure has been under con
sideration for a lone: time and two ses
sions were held to-day in ordor to bring
the matter to a conclusion. The bill of
Prpresentative Phcrman of New York is
the one favorably actod upon, with a
number, of amendments. This provides
for private construction of the line, the
Government paying $30fl.nno annually for
twenty yÂ«.;irs for the transmission of mes
saprs.
Â¦ The amount of this annual payment
nas the last Question decided. The orig
inal .provision was for $400,009. but. after
extended discussion, the reduction to J300,
(M) whs m:nJ<\ Th.Â» committee had pre
viously inserted a clause that the cable
be of American make and the cableships
shall be under the American flag. An
other provision calls for the completion
of the line to Honolulu by January 1. 1&02,
and to Japan by January. 1303. It was
originally estimated that the cost of the
cable would be $s.O-M.<*>o.- but recent esti
mates submitted to the committee show a
ri?e in pricep of material will make the
cost about WjOOO.OOO. The Government's
ebUgJitloo. however, is confined to the an
nual payment of 1330.000.

MAY PRESENT
TRADE TREATY
WITH ITALY
Commissioner Kasson Is
Now Considering the
Subject."
However, as the Measure Would Fol
low the Lines "of the French -
Treaty, It Seems Doomed
to Defeat. "<
Special Dispatch to The Call.'
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, March G.^-
It Is. understood that Mr. Kassor,,. the
Commissioner whom President McKinley
has designated to prepare reciprocal trade
arrangements with different foreign coun
triesunder authority conferred by section
3 of the Dingley act, is making prelim
inary studies of the Italian exports to this
country with a view to drawing upan
Italian reciprocal trade^rrangement. Mr.
Kasson's efforts with his trade arrange
ments In the past have met with no suc
cess. His latest tattempt with France is
conceded on every hand to be "doomed to
failure, and as the articles of trade In
volved in an Italian reciprocity treaty
would be closely similar to those in the
French and Jamaican treaties there 1c no
reason to believe that the Italian ar
rangement will escape the same fate .
. The members of the California delega
tion have been rt-celvlng telegrams urging
them to continue the vigorous opposition
which has defeated other treaties hostile
to California's Interests, and there is no

Senator, Perkins has discovered a prece
dent which has an Important bearing on
the disputed point of the right of tha
House to;pass on these. reciprocal. treaties.
It has been maintained that these trade
arrangements, .being in. the nature ' of
treaties, require only ratification by the
Senate. The House has conceded that
Fince these treaties all affect' the revenues
of this country, and 'not merely the for
eign policies, the .House must act jointly
with the Senate,' because under the consti
tution all revenue legislation must have
their co-operation. Senator Perkins -has
found that when' the question of abro
gating the Hawaiian treaty came up In
the Senate. Senator -MoitM. then chair
man of the Finance Committee of the Sen
ate, demanded that the bill be referred to
his committee,. because It affected the ie.v
enucs of this country.: A point of order
was made that the proper reference of the
Mil was to the Committee Qn> Foreign Ro
latoins, but the president of the Senate
ruled In favor of Mr..Morrlll. While, it'ia
true that the Senate, by a'majority -vote,
referred the treaty to the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, principally on account- of
Senator Morrill's well-known hostility* to
Hawaiian annexation, â¢ the- ruling- of * the
presiding officer established- a' precedent,
to the effect that treaties r affecting Ihe
revenues of this country are subject tp the
control of committees having jurisdiction

James B. Sovereign Describes Scenes
, in the "Bull Pen'V and~thÂ©--~r
Conduct of Merriam's
Soldiers. - >
'â¢ - - Â«v
"WASHINGTON. March 6.â Before the
Coeur d'Alene investigation was resumed
to-day the House Military Committee held
an executive session , and decided not to
call upon the President for affidavits fi!Â«d
With him relative to the. conditions of the
mining country under ma'rtlal law. This
decision was due to some question as to
the right to make such requests -of tha
President, and, more particularly, because
the affidavits were not considered legal
evidence. :
â¢Andrew Devlin, a miner, was the first
witness to-day. His evidence was directed
to showing that orderly conditions.pre
vailed and that the local authorities could
have dealt with the situation' without re
sort to martial law. Â¦ '/ '
' James K. . Sovereign, former master
workman of the Knights of I^abor, sa'<l
he was in the Coeur d'Alene district dur
ing the demonstration against the Bunker
Hill mines and was editor of the official
organ of the miners' organization at Wal
lace, Idaho. . He attended a labor meeting
at Gem, Idaho, the night before the blow
ing up of the mill; and later that .night
attended a meeting at Wallace, but there
was no talk of blowing up the mill. He
never heard 'that any demonstration was
contemplated against the mining property.
The next morning, while standing in front
of. his office a man on horseback rodo by
and said! - â¢ '
" "Sovereign, they are coming."
V He . asked j who was . coming, and the
horseman answered:
"The Canyon Creekers."
Many Men With Winchesters,
-. He saw a train with a number of men
aboard going down to Wardner. There
were conflicting rumors of what would oc
cur at.Wardper. He went down on the
noon train and reached Wardner. in time
to hear the thrse explosions when the mill
was blown up. He saw many men, some
with Winchesters, and there was consider
able > fighting. To avoid the conflict h'j
stepped upon an engine. . While on th*Â»
engine a man with a revolver boarded the
cab and demanded that the train Ibe
brought to a stop,- and this was don*.
Meantime there Â¦, was some shooting into
the flume of <he mining camp. The train
then proceeded to' Wallace. There was
no excitement there. The same quiet pre
vailed at Wardner, Kellogg and other
points. 'Â¦' Â¦ Â¦Â¦ - -.. Â¦ â¢
Sovereign told of his appearance before
the Coroner, when many soldiers and sev
eral lawyers identified with the mining
interests were present. As the military
was in control; Sovereign applied to mili
tar.y headquarters for a pass.. The wit
ness said he told the major in command
that he was president of a Montana min
ing company. Thereupon the officer
showed excessive affability and said the
military forces proposed to take care of
the mine operators. He heard he was to
be arrested, but this never occurred.
Sovereign said he had advised that the
soldiers be used to assist the local author
ities, but not to enforce martial law. In
stead of that, martial law was enforced
with extreme severity. The conditions
were less acute, he said, than in Chicago
during the great strike, and yet the mili
tary system adopted was far more rigid.
Insolence of Negro.Soldiers.
â¢ Sovereign described scenes, $t .the .Vbull
pen.'-' : He" said Â¦he I heard i negro, soldiers
use obscene language against the Impris
oned, miners. . When ' tha , man were ar r
rested they 'wore light clothwiÃ, such as
Is used in deep, mines, and, although the
weather was very cold, they.' received no
additional clothing. ' " â¢
The witness stated that while one. of
the miners was in the "bullpen," a. per
son attempted to force an entrance to the
room pf the miner's wife. The man com
mitting the offense was arrested by a
local constable, but afterward released by
the soldiers. Â¦ When asked who was the
responsible- official in charge of affairs.
Sovereign* said there was no difference
between - Governor Steunenberg, Gen
eral Merriam, Captain Edwards and Au
ditor Sinclair. 3 . . *
"They all had Krag-Jorgensens behind
them," he declared. '
He added that one of the mine officials
had given the order to "fire" at the time
the demented miner, Johnson, was shot.
Sovereign will continue to-morrow, j

LITTLE Bennle Laws, 13 years
old, walked in his sleep yester
day morning and plunged to
his death through a window
while pursuing an imaginary enemy.
His mother, seeing his danger, had
tried to catch him and for a brief
moment had hold of his heel as he
was falling out of the window, but
the foot slipped from her grasp and
he was dashed to death In the yard
below.
Mrs. Lillian Laws resides at 226 De
visadero street, where the tragedy oc
curred. With her were her son, Ben
jamin H. Laws, and her daughter, her
husband being absent in the East.
The boy was a victim of dyspepsia,
and this disease brought on insom
nia, but he was never known to walk
in his sleep. " At 1 o'clock yesterday
morning Mrs. Laws, whose slumbers
were light, was awakened by the
sound of the boy running around the
rooms. She got out of bed and found
him in the hall pursuing -an Imagi
nary burglar and crying "Stop him,
stop him! Don't let him get away!"
The peculiar sound -of the child's
voice and his actions convinced his
mother. that he was in a somnambu
listic state, and she ran after him to
awaken him and prevent him from
hurting himself. At that moment he
ran into his own room and, vaulting
over his bed, jumped through the
window. His distracted mother threw
herself desperately forward , and
caught hold of one of his heels as he
was disappearing, but it slipped out
of her grasp, and he fell to the yard
twenty feet below. In his fall he
struck the kitchen porch and then the
ground.
M. T. Moses, an uncle of the boy,
picked up the mangled and uncon
scious form and carried it upstairs.
Medical aid was summoned, but the
poor little fellow was past all cure.
He had one moment of conscious
ness, and when he looked up at his
weeping mother and she saw that he
recognized uer she asked him to put
his arms around her neck. With the
last remnant of his fast ebbing
strength he twined his arms about his
mother's neck, laid his head upon her
bosom and smiled into her face. Then
he closed his eyes and passed away.
reau scheme. The men have found little
so far to encourage them in the belief
that their demands will be acceded, to
by the management in San Francisco.
They are. in fact, thoroughly satisfied
that their complaints will be sent East
for settlement. In that event
must elapse before they secure a final an
swer.
Sufficient ha? been made public through
one source and another to establish the
fact that the organized departments of
labor In the railroad service are unani
mously opposed to Huntington's insur
ance proposition. The brotherhoods have
completed their plans for concerted action
in opposition to tho bureau. The next
step, so far as the Western division ope
rators are concerned, has been definitely
formulated. The brotherhoods, it is un
derstood, propose to make a campaign
among the unorganized employes. These
Include the shopmen, mechanics, laborers,
car repairers, car cleaners and the like
who have not been banded together since
the American Railway Union was dis
solved. These men are in a position to
take individual stands for or against the
bureau, because they have no ties of
federation to bind them to concerted
moves.
The argument which appeals to mÂ»n in
the brotherhoods has not the same weight
with these outside employes. The broth
erhoods stand firm in the belief that their
organized existence is jeopardized by this
company insurance plan. Certain It is
they declare that under the provisions of
the* scheme no new employe who is com
pelled to join the Insurance bureau will
feel like affiliating with a brotherhood
which is fundamentally an insurance or-
ganizatlon. The argument the brother
hood men make is that they will be de
prived of the opportunity of Increasing
their membership, and that it will be only
a matter of time when the brotherhoods
will die.; - s -.--"Â¦
Not a few of the subordinate officials
have been approached by the men since
the new scheme was promulgated, but
none of them has been able to overcome
that chief objection to the plan.
Every feature of tho Insurance plan is
being earefuly discussed at the brother
hoods* meetings, that the special commit
tee which is to appear before Genorol
Manaper Kruttschnitt next week will be
full}' fortified to explain the position of
the men. There is hardly a clause In vhe
scheme that meets the approval of the af
fected employes. They see between the
lines the hand of coercion. \VhilÂ»
on the surface there is no
suggestion of compulsion so far
as. old employes are concerned, the
men are so thoroughly satisfied that re.
fusalto join will eventually result in loss
of position that they take no stock what
ever in the voluntary aspect of the situ
ation. It is compulsory that all men en
tering- the service of the company afttr
March 1 must join the relief bureau. The
chief difficulty the men have to contend
against in making- a united front Is the
possible attitude of the unorganized em
ployes. But to overcome this no oppoitu
nity Is being lost to show those workmen
that their interests do not Up in any other
direction than that pointed out by the
brotherhoods.
There is no disposition on the part of the
engineers, conductors, firemen anrl other
train men to unduly magnify the danger

EXTRA POLICE
TO WATCH THE
HIGHBINDERS
Authorities Endeavoring to
Suppress Further War
Among Chinese.
Fighting Tongs Have Not Yet Slaked
Their Thirst for Revenge and
More Trouble Is Ex
pected.
Chinatown is in a ferment and the high
binders have only pocketed ] their guns
and sheathed â¢ their knives until some
fresh imaginary . wrong that demands
expiation by blood lays hold of them. The
complication of the tongs is a veritable
Chinese puzzle, but this time both branch
associations of the See Yups and
Yups are dove-tailed, prohibiting the pos
sibility of a big trade war between these
two societies. '* . .
The murder of two fish merchants Mon
day morning may or may not settle the
present score. Both -men were members
of the Sam Yup Company, but not at
tached to any of the warring tongs. Just
what new alliances will be. made among
the tongs and what blood must be let to
satisfy the highbinders' fury for revenge
may be determined at any day.
An arrest was made yesterday morning
by Detective Ed. Gibson of a Chinese said
to be one of the murderers who shot down
the two merchants. His name is Chang
Chung, but all connection with the event
is emphatically denied by him.
The Police Department is formulating
various schemes to prevent future China
town outrages. Chief Sullivan has de
tailed an extra squad of policemen for
duty in the turbulent quarter. Sergeant
Pat Mahoney has been put in charge. Un
der him will be Patrolmen Mackey, Daly,
Driscoll and Behan, all of whom are stal
wart officers. Sergeant Mahoney was
specially selected because of his rcputa
â¢tion as a silencer of hpodlumism. The
squad will attend to highbinders exclu
sively, assisted by Detective Ed Gibson.
Dong Gong, interpreter in the police
courts, and the man who started a late
highbinder trouble, declares that the ven
geance wreaked upon the two merchants
Monday morning was originally meant for
Dong Gong and his family. The Suey
Sings have laid $500 blood money upon
Dong Gong, he says, and he is ; yet wait
ing.
Consul Ho Vow is of the opinion that
international agreement will alone settle
the differences between the highbinder so
cieties, unless the Chief of Police in
creases the force in Chinatown and beats
down lawlessness by force of arms.
of serious trouble. But many of them rio
not hesitaie to declare that there will be
no stopping until some favorable result is
attained. Not since ISS4 have the men
been so determined to assert their side of
the controversy with the company. ' .
Evidence of the care which Is beinÂ«;
taken by the men to maintain a dignified
yet strong position is manifested in their
refusal to furnish information concerning
the executive meetings which are being
held this week by the various brother
hoods. Orders have been given that the
members shall not publicly discuss the In
surance scheme nor any of the objections
they have *to it. Every move has been
made primarily to organize a represenia
the grievance ermmlttee, which shall be
equipped to make a proper showing beroro
the railroad officials.
If failure shall result then another pro
gramme of attack on the scheme will bo
inaugurated. Whether this will culminate
in a strike is a matter for future develop

Possible Opposition by the Leader of
Brotherhood of locomotive En
gineers Thus Done Away
With.
When the Southern Pacific Company
conceived the new relief department it
did so with a prescience of possible oppo
elUon on the part of the railroad em
ployes. Long before the plans were form
ulated the first step was taken and Gov
ernor Henry T. Gage was called on to
render his assistance. Gage's helpful
Ji* 3^ as raJsed b y the appointment of
iÂ» ' ileVM " as Labor Commissioner.
Meyer was the most formidable man the
railroad company had met in its dealings
with the brotherhood associations, lie
was at the head of the Brotherhood of
l^ocomotive Engineers, the strongest so
ciety of laboring men that came In
active and daily contact with the govern
ing powers of the yellow building. For
tight years Meyer represented the loco
motive engineers with unfaltering zeal.
He knew their power and their influence
and was at all times the champion of their
cause whenever disputes that needed set
tlement arose or differences had to be pet
tied That the railroad company respected
Merer s power and Influence was ' dis
p!aj-ed on more than one occasion.
With the idea of a relief bureau in mind
the Southern Pacific master minds can
vassed the entire field. They scheduled
anc tabulated the obstacles that stood In
the way of ultimate success. H. V. Meyer
was the greatest possible obstruction to
the successful consummation of their
ecfceme, so they found a place which they
theught he might accept- The Southern
Pacific Induced Gage to make the appoint
ment and the strongest man in the broth
erhood organization took the bait. Mey
er's successor in the Brotherhood of Loco
motive Engineers has neither his experi
ence nor influence.
When Meyer received his appointment
there was a batch of applicants for the
position. The Governor had previously
anr.ounced that he would select a man
froai the ranks of labor, and the race for
the appointment was hotly contested. At
the last moment Meyer's candidacy was
announced, to the .utter surprise of all
other aspirants. Without any ado or hesl
tarcy Gage made him his choice and now
thÂ« Southern Pacific relief department
coiceivers simile to think they have de
pr.ved the men who might make an or
ganized stand against the scheme of their

THE CHRISTIAN'S POWER.
Rev. Philip Coombe spoke beforÂ© the
Congregational ministers at their " meet-
Ing on Monday, his subject beinfl "The
Christian's Power Over Opposing Forces."
In part he said:
We are living in an age in which the forces
which arise to arrest the progress of truth are
everywhere in evidence and strikingly in ar
ray. Many Christians, both ministers and lay
men, oftentimes allow thesÂ« adversaries to ex
ert i too (treat an influence over them. In this
materialistic age we are too prone to let that
which Is material have the mastery when we
ought to exercise the authority God has given
us over everything material. It is the Chris
tian's'privilegeâit Is every man's prerogative â
to use the power which God has given to him
over all opposing forces, to overrule them for
the elevation of humanity and the extension
of our Captain's cause. Science and history
and biography teach us that it is by looking be
yond and above the forces that are against us
and grasping them with the power which God
has given us that we are upheld and renewed
in strength, enabled to mount up with Â¦ wings
as- eagles and to lift others as. we rise. Even
when wa seem to be defeated by antagonistic
forces we may grapple them more surely and
rise by - them more securely. We are to oount
It all Joy when we are put Into hard: places
where we are surrounded by hostile forces It
may show, to us that God thinks a great deal
of us by intrusting that which Is difficult and
Important into our hands and by assuring us
that He will make us more than conquerors
through Him Â¦ that hath loved us.

OUR TRADE WITH THE ORIENT.
IZIJROM the Department of Agriculture there has
1 been issued a bulletin of statistics concerning our
trade with China, Japan and Hongkong for the
decade ending with 1899. The showing made of the
development of the trade is remarkable, for during the
ten years it increased from a total of $46,294,167 in
ISB9 to $87,305,688 during the last fiscal year.
Of the total amount of the traffic of 1809 the exports
from China, Japan and Hongkong to the United
States were valued at $47,815,035, while the imports
from this country were valued at $39,400,653. The
showing made by the statistics .is therefore not as
gratifying. as it might be. There are no natural rea
sons why our exports to the Orient should not be at
least equal, to the value of our imports, and there is
some satisfaction in noting that the tendency is in
that direction. Thus on comparing the exports of
1889 with those of ten years later it appears that the
value of our exportations to those countries increased
during the decade by 256 per cent, while the value of
our imports from them increased only, 36 per cent.
Detailed statistics showing the relative quantities
and values of the various exports during 1890, were
not available at the time of the preparation of the bul
letin, but in the previous year 40 per cent of the whole
were of agricultural products, while in 1889 only 25
per cent were of that character. The article which
figures chiefly in the increase is wheat,' the shipments
of which to Japan alone increased from $300,609 in
1889 to $8,969,816 in 1898. , . .'
Taken as a whole the exporta of 1898 consisted
mainly of five leading articlesâ cotton, cotton manu
factures, kerosene oil, wheat flour and manufactures
of iron and, steel. Of these items it is significant that
the importations of raw cotton were- valued at over
$7,000,000, while the cotton manufactures were valued
at but little more than $63,000. It seems the orientaj
people are beginning to use our raw material and do
their own spinning. Â» ,
There is little question butjwhat.we could largely
increase our exports to China if we would follow the
policy which has enabled Germany to enter that mar
ket with .such , success against Great Britainâ
that of employing as Consuls men who can speak the
language 1 of the people. /and promoting steamship
lines to carry on the commerce. The Japanese and
the Chinese are our neighbors and should be . our
customers.; They will . be ko as soon as we enter ac
tively into the task of beating our European rivals by
the adoption of mercantile tactics as wise as their own.

LIGHT ON THE PHILIPPINES.
r\ YEAR ago the Filipino "rebellion" was over.
rA A few days after a Kansas soldier's gun precipi
* * tated hostilities, and after Torres, representing
Aguinaldo, had assured General Otis that there had
been no intention to bring on a war, that it was an ac
cident caused by retaliation of the first shot fired by
our side, and Otis had replied that war had begun
and must go on to the bitter end, official dispatches
from Manila announced that pacification had been ac
complished.
Reference to the files of the daily press prove this.
April 3, 1599, Otis cabled: "Present indications de
note insurgent government in perilous condition; its
army defeated, discouraged and scattered; insurgents
returning to their homes." June 1 Otis telegraphed
thct 30.000 soldiers will suffice for effective control of
the Philippines. August 12 the President announced
that Ajruinaldo was making his last play, and the war
would be over by November I. August 16 it was de
cided to send tp Otis 63.500 soldiers to pacify the

March 3 Associated Press reports interview with
one of our military officers in Manila, that rebel army
has been wonderfully rehabilitated in the last month,
particularly in the northern provinces: that Filipinos
professedly friendly to us are officers in the wide
spread Masonic organization which dedicates itself to
independence. They are circulating Senator Beve
ridge's speech to prove that we mean simply an op
pressu'e commercial exploitation of the islands, and
an editorial from an administration newspaper in
Washington declaring the same thing.
Otis has sent for 1000 pairs of handcuffs to be used
on American soldiers who have been driven insane by
the climate.
March 5 General Wheeler arrives and reports a
banquet by the Sultan of Sulu and return festivities to
the polygamous Mahometan on board an American
nian-of-war. Colonel Barry says there remains but
a scattered fragment of Aguinaldo's forces. Telegrams

and foreigners doing business compelled to live on
ships in the harbor of Legaspi, or in the American

San Miguel Bay: Adjutant Gallagher killed, eight
Americans wounded; same date an amigo led our
men into an ambush and killed Lieutenant Kohler; in
revenge our troops burned a town and slew twenty
four of the villagers. Same date transport Sheridan
sailed from Manila with a large number of convicts
and twenty insane soldiers.
The dullest man must be impressed by the record.
Another rainy season is at hand and the islands are
less pacified than a year ago, except the Sultan of
Sulu. who is reported by General Wheeler to be proud
to be under the stars and stripes with his harem and
his slaves. But at last light is breaking in this coun
try, and at the right point in the political sky. Presi
dent McKinley has appointed a new commission to
deal with the Philippine question. He chose first his
personal and political friend, Judge Taft of Cincin
nati. The Judge's friends banqueted him on the sth
tr.st. The banquet was presided over by Mr. M. E.
Ingalls. who announced himself an expansionist of the
most radical order. A speech followed by Judge
Taft's former law partner. Judge Harmon, who was
â¢Attorney General in Mr. Cleveland's last Cabinet.
Harmon brought a profound hush upon the company
by a carefully worded speech against expansion. In
its course one guest cried out, "There are only four
of you." But its conclusion was heartily applauded.
The last speech was made by Judge Taft himself, and
furnished the genuine surprise of the occasion. He
said: "The Philippine Commission is not yet organ
ised. Its members have not conferred together. I
speak therefore for myself alone. Like Judge Har
mon, and unlike Chairman Ingalls, I am not now and
never have been an expansionist. I have always
hoped that the. jurisdiction of our nation would not
extend beyond territory between the two oceans. We
have not solved all the problems of popular govern
ment so perfectly as to justify our voluntarily seeking
more difficult ones abroad."
So breaks the light. The sycophants, who have
mnde the mistake of thinking that President McKin
ley demanded disciples instead of advisers, will be ad
.monished by his appointment of Judge Taft that: he
proposes not to conclude public opinion on this sub
ject, but to go on the line to which The Call has ad
vised Congress to adhere, by letting legislation alone
as to our external possessions until the facts can all
be known, when a right policy will crystallize. It is
noteworthy that Mr. Ingalls. who presided at the Taft
banquet, is a Democrat. ' General Wheeler, another
Democrat, comes home from the Philippines inflam
ing American greed by putting commercial exploita
tion foremost as the only reason he has for conquest
of thf inlands. So he exclaims, in rapt admiration of
the almighty dollar, "It only requires American brains
and push to make the Philippine*, Guam and Sulus
the most productive islands on the face of the earth."
There are 'to be many international conferences , at
the Paris exposition, but. there will be no attempt to
duplicate the late gathering at the Hague even as a
side show. : v?
THE STOCKMEN ORGANIZE.
IT seems novel that an industry as important as the
livestock interest of the Pacific States has been, up
to this time, without organization. .
The Western tour of the Secretary of Agriculture
last summer was partly for the purpose of inspecting
the condition of the Western stock ranges on the arid
lands of the public domain. His practical eye saw at
once the deterioration of these land:, by destruction of
their natural forage crop, causea by overstocking
through the use' of them in common. He advised a
change in the method of grazing, and that the stock
range?, more valuable for that than any other present
! purpose, be protected by leaseholds, the title remain
ing in the Federal Government, and the lands being
so under Federal control that the Government can
compel the renewal of their forage and the restoration
of their primitive capacity for feeding stock. In the
beginning the stockmen were indifferent. Many^pre
| ferred to let things go on as they have been going, to
I let the forage crop be destroyed, and deciding that
as after them would come the desert and the drought
; they would get all they could off the common range
! for a few years and retire from the business. But the
impulse given to the subject by the Secretary of Ag
riculture was sufficient to induce the introduction of
several bills to effect the purpose he favored. Still the
policy of indifference" and delay was manifested by the
stockmen themselves. It will be remembered that
when the water storage convention met in this city
last November its whole purpose was held up by cer
tain influences which promised that the grazing lands
should be leased and the revenue therefrom, above the
cost of administration, should be given to the States*
and Territories in which the lands lie for use in stor
ing flood waters for irrigation. So "the increase of
irrigating water by preventing the flood waste came to
be impinged upon the leasehold policy for the grazing
lands.
Mr. Irish of California, while in Washington last
January, found the leasing question in abeyance, wait
ing for tfce stockmen to relax their indifference,
withdraw their opposition, or cease their policy of
delay. As he had promoted the water storage conven
tion and plan, he saw the necessity of getting the leas
ing policy in action, and to that end invited the stock
men of the Pacific States to the conference held in
this city on Monday. The results, so far, are grati
fying. All shades of opinion were represented at the
meeting. Many differences were composed by getting
together. A permanent organization was formed,
which already includes a membership in California,
Nevada, Arizona. New Mexico and Oregon. A me
morial oa the subject of the leaseholds was addressed
to Congress and ordered circulated in the arid re
gions, and all indifference was submerged in a most
active interest. Mr. Ifusk. the permanent president,
in declaring the proper features of a leasehold bill,
.^?id that no bill should pass that did not regard
equally the interests of the landholder, the agricultural
settler, present and future, the mineral prospector, the
small herdsman, and all the classes of citizens who
make up the sturdy frontier population of- the arid
regions, where the grazing lands lie. This sentiment
is fully expressed in the memorial. It was the general
iee!ing that the Foster bill, now before the Senate,
offtrs the best basis for the perfection of a satisfactory
measure, which should be passed by the present Con
gress. All agreed that no opportunity should be
offered by the law for the large meat-packing com
bines to get hold of the ranges, and that the lawless
ness that has too much characterized the use of
ranges in common would cease by permitting the
owners of all kinds of stock to lease ranges and then
compelling them to keep their livestock on their own
holdings.
The greatest benefit is likely to follow this organi
zation. Every stockman should be a,membcr of it. and
it shoulci not cease its activities until the lands con
cerned are protected against destruction of their for
age, the meat supply against decline, and the future
settler assured of a home on an agricultural holding,
wherever the possibility may appear.

WHERE THE GERMANS BEAT US.
T \EPORTS from Washington are to the effect
U-/ that the diplomatic and consular reform bill
has been shelved in committee and is not likely
to be taken up in the House at this session. On the
other hand, reports from Berlin announce that the
imperial Government has undertaken a thorough re
organization of the German consular service, with the
intention of making it even more effective than at
present.
It is to be borne in mind that the consular service
of Germany is already one of the best trained and ad
ministered commercial bureaus in the world. Through
ihe efficiency of their representatives abroad, the mer
chants and the manufacturers of the empire have rap
idly advanced to a leading rank among the great com
mercial nations. They are now rivals of Great Brit
ain in all parts of ; the globe, and are one of the
strongest competitors we will have to meet in our
efforts to expand our foreign trade. It is, then, a
matter of considerable concern to us that a movement
toward an improvement in the consular service is
dropped at Washington simultaneously with the un
dertaking of an enterprise toward that end at Berlin.
It may be conceded that our Consuls have done
good work in times past, but the times have changed,
and the class of men in our service has not changed
with them. In the days when our exports were made
up almost wholly of raw material or foodstuffs and
were shipped mainly to Great Britain, and.' when we
had no very active competition to meet, our system
of selecting Consuls did fairly well. Now, however,
we are shipping enormous quantities of manufac
tured goods and have come into direct rivalry with na
tions having a trained consular corps. We must, then,
have more competent representatives abroad than we
have had before. It is a necessity of the times!
The handicap upon our commerce resulting from
inefficient Consuls has been noted by the more inteU
ligent Chinese and Japanese themselves. In his re
cent address before the University of Pennsylvania
Wu Ting Fang. Chinese Minister at Washington,
said: JJ l \ must acknowledge that your diplomatic and
consular officers in China have thus far acquitted
themselves well, considering the -disadvantageous
position in which they are placed. Most of the
European Governments send young men to the East
to learn the language and study, the customs of the
country. After, a residence of two or. three years,
when they prove themselves proficient, after pass
ing a strict examination, they are placed in responsible
positions as student interpreters, consular assistants,
etc. Merit' is rewarded- by promotion. Thus those
Governments have competent men specially fitted for
service in the Orient.* It may not be unwise for your
Government to adopt a: similar system.'.' - -

SPRINKLING OF
STREETS TO BE
AGAIN ARGUED
Merchants' Association About
to Consider Matter
Once More.
Supervisors May Be Asked to. Repeal
the Ordinance That Provides
for Keeping the Pave
ments Dry.
At tho next meeting of the board of
directors of the Merchants' Association a
petition to the board to exercise its influ
ence with the Supervisors to have the or
dinance repealed that was passed about a
year ago forbidding the sprinkling of the
bituminlzed streets in the city will be
taken up for consideration. The matter
has been brought to " the notice .of tho
Merchants' Association by several retail
merchants doing business -on Kearny
street. The ordinance was passed by tho
efforts of the Sflciety for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, their reason being
that water caused the horses to slip.
Â¦ President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association said yesterday afternoon that
the retail merchants on Kearny street harl
quite generally asked for the influence of
the association to have the ordinance re
pealed, but that up to that time he had
not heard that any Market street mer
chants had moved in the matter. lie hod
no idea what action the directors of the
association were likely to take. The argu
ments, as- he summed them up pro arrl
con, were in substance that on one side
were the dangers to horses when the pavo
ments were sprinkled and also the sup
posed damage to pavements due to the use
of water, which was said to rot them. On
the other side the arguments were that
the dust in the absence of the sprinkling
of the pavements in the business sections
of the city damaged storks of goods of
all sorts; also that the dust was a sonrc*
of discomfort to residents and visitors ta
the city, and also might tend to proDa
gate disease. ".There were merchants who
wished to have .the existing conditions
changed, -because the city, had seemingly
taken a backward step in. the matter of
cleanliness in the most traveled and most
used thoroughfares. He had no personal
opinion to express, for he did not wish to
prejudge .. the case. Doubtless the . whole
subject would be discussed at the meeting
of the directors, for it had been placed
upon the regular programme for consider
ation.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals will probably oppose the
repeal of the ordinance, or at least that
was the view of the matter taken by Sec
retary Holbrook last evening. He said
that he would like to be heard by the
Merchants' Association directors and
would probably request the privilege of a
hearing.

A SOUTHERN PACIFIC TRICK.
SOMETHING more than ordinary submissive
ness or stupidity would have been required on
the part of the employes of the Southern Pacific
Railroad to induce them to accept the new scheme of
"relief" without at least as much of a protest as men
dependent upon the corporation for work and wages
can afford to make. The scheme is an ingenious
combination of tricks to defraud the employes and
benefit the corporation. - ? x ,-*j" :
The most salient feature of the plan is the evident
design to break down Â¦ the various "brotherhoods"
which the employes have organized for mutual pro
tection and benefit. An important part of the work
of the brotherhoods is to provide relief for members
in case of sickness or accident. The funds for such
purposes are raised by an assessment upon the mem
bership, and it is, clear that if the members be now
forced to "voluntarily" join the corporation . relief
scheme and pay contributions to that fund, the
brotherhoods will be heavily handicapped and may
be even forced out of existence.
That, however, is but one of the tricks of the
scheme. Another hardly less important is to be found
in the clause by which all who sign the application fo/.
membership in the corporation relief plan release the
company from all claims for damages by reason of
injury or death. As the law stands the corporation
would have to pay such damages out of its own
funds, but b>' the operation of the new relief system
the payments to the injured man or to the family of
one who is killed are taken out of the funds contributed
by the employes. Thus the employes are to be made
to pay for any accident to one of them, although due
to the negligence of the corporation itself.
Collis Huntington has frequently boasted that no
one would ever track him through .the world by the
quarters he had dropped. It might be easy to iden
tify him, however, by the number of quarters found on
him that belong to other people. This latest scheme
of taxing out of the pockets of wage-earners the pay
ments which should be made by the corporation it
self is one of the meanest pieces of thrift of which
even Collis has ever been proud.
Mr. Hess, the gentleman whom Huntington sent
out from the East to organize the relief scheme "vol
untarily," has given a frank statement of the advan
tages which the widow and the fatherless will derive
from the scheme. He said if an employe of the rail
road should be killed and the widow sue for damages
and the court award them the corporation would not
pay. It would appeal from one court to another
court and prolong the litigation until lawyers' fees had
eaten up all that was due the widow. It is a plain
boast that the railroad can use the courts at its pleas
ure to voluntarily defeat justice, and from the boast
the argument is drawn that the employes would better
come into the scheme and consent to pay the dam
ages, for the railroad will not.
There was but one thing needed to cap the climax
of corporation tyranny and fraud, and it was promptly
forthcoming â Mr. Hess called the scheme "philan
thropy." . , - Â¦

"v^TTTHE LITERATURE OF PERSIA.
BY PROF. PAUL ELMER MORE.
In studying Persian literature It Is nec
essary first of all . to have some under
standing of the important historical
â¢changes through whicif the people of Iran
passed. Three strongly marked periods
may be observed: I. the ancient; 11. the
middle, and 111, the new. In the first
period we have records In two distinct
though closely related languages â the
Avestan, which will be the particular sub
ject of this paper, and the old Persian
contained In cuneiform Inscriptions on
stone extending from a few years after
the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus In 53!)
B. C. to the conquest of Alexander. From
the age of Alexander, when Greek influ
ence became predominant In Asia Minor,
until the Sassanian dynasty came to the
throne, in the third century, after Christ,
there is a complete blank in Persian rec
ords. With the Sassanian Kings the old
Magian priests regained their influence,
and the Zoroastrian religion became all
powerful In the state. The sacred books
in the ancient Avestan language became
the Bible of the land. But In the mean
while the language of the country had
suffered great changes, and the religious
commentaries, corresponding to the Pa
tristic literature of tne Christians, were
now composed in the Pahlavi, a tongue
which is related to old Persian much as
Italian is related to Latin. This body of
Pahlavi commentaries forms the middle
period. But Persian was doomed to un
dergo another and more far-reaching rev
olution. In the seventh century the coun
try was subdued by the Arabs, and hence
forth Mohammedanism became the re
ligion of the land. A number of the Per
sians escaped as colonists and settled In
India, where their descendants, the Par
sees, still live and maintain the ancient
Zoroastrian faith. Among them are pre
served the sacred Avesta and the later
Pahlavi books, although their spoken lan
guage has altered considerably since the
days of the Sassanids.
Meanwhile with the Arab conquest
Persia itself entered upon a new era. The
language developed into modern Persian
and was modified by a large Infusion of
Arabic words. The modern Persian lit
erature may be said to have begun about
the year 1000 A. D., with the Shah Xameh,
the great epic of Flrdusl. Intrinsically
and considered as pure literature modern
Persian, including such names as Firdusl,
Saadi, Omar Khayyam, Hatlz and others,
ranks easily first among Oriental litera
tures. The Persian inscriptions and the
Pahlavi books we must, for lack of space,
pass over unnoticed. To-day let us turn
for a moment to the Avesta, which con
tains the ancient religion of Zoroaster.
Of the two kindred people united under
Cyrus into one great empire the Medes
are the oldest In civilization, and it was
arr.ong them that the strange and little
understood religion of the Maglans de
veloped. The Magians themselves were
apparently a tribe of priestly inheritance,
very much like the Levltes among the
Jews. They were the learned men of the
East, familiar to us from the Bible, and if
for a time, under the sway of Persian and
Greek rulers, their authority was some
what diminished, they at last came to
their own under the Sassanian dynasty.
It is not easy to determine what was the
original form of the Magian religion, be
cause in the form in which It has come
down to us it was profoundly modified by
the influence of one dominant reformer.
In general, however. It must have been
largely akin to the polytheistic faith of
the Hindu Vedas, for. In fact, the Hindu
and Iranian religions were sisters derived
from a common mother.
But In the seventh century B. C. there
arose in Media a man of profound re
ligious instinct, a great prophet, who
wrought a revolution in the popular faltb.
From that day to -this the religion of the
Magians is called Zoroastrlanism, r.fter
his name. A few years ago it waa com
mon to speak of Zoroaster aa a mere
myth; Just as Buddha and Christ were
myths to a certain school of skeptlc3. But
reflection and investigation have modified
this view, and to-day Zoroaster is recog
nized as a distinct historic personality.
We even know something of his lif*. \V y e
know how, like other reformers, he be
came dissatisfied with the grossness of the
national faith and for years lived apart in
search of the truth. We know that he be
gan his mission of preaching at the age of
30, and we know the name of the Prince
(Vishtaspa) who finally accepted his doc
trine and became for Iran what Constan
tine was for Christendom. We even know
that the prophet was thrice married
(strange as this may seem) and that he
left children.
The doctrine of Zoroaster Is contained In
the so-called Avesta, the only relic of the
Avestan language, which, as we have
seen, was closely akin to ancient Per3!an.
The Avesta is a collection of rel'glous
laws, myths, litanies and hymns, now eas
ily accessible in translation, and notwith
standing an occasional note of true spirit
uality must be regarded on the whole'as
one of the dreariest and least interesting
ii ".he world's Bibles. It requires an ex
traordinary- effort of Impgina'ion to under
stand how so much childish folly and rw
true religious spirit could be conr>blned.
Essentially the faith of Zoroaster Is a pro
nounced dualism. On the one side stood
Ormazd and the angels of light; on the
other side are ranged Ahriman and the
princes of darkness. Into this ceaseless
struggle man is thrown and must bear his
part in the conflict. His duty is to pre
serve his purity intact; uncleanness Is the
great sin. So It was that death was looked
upon as uncleanness, and the most char
acteristic rite was then, and is still among
the Pariseps, the custom of exposing dead
bodies to be devoured by the fowls of th 3
air, so that neither earth nor water nor
fire should be made Impure by decay. To
us the most Interesting fact In connection
with Zoroastrianlsm Is Its Infiltration lntÂ»
Christianity through Manichaeism and it 3
IMPERIOUS IN
DISGRACE WITH
TURF FOLLOWERS
The Burns Handicap Winner
Ran Unplaced in a Race
at Oakland.
>
Sea Bass, Favorite for the Two-Year-
Old Scramble, Injured at the
Post â Potente a Mud
Runner.
Imperious, the fortunate winner of the
great Burns handicap, started in a seven
furlong free handicap at Oakland yester
day, finishing outside of the money, being
beaten by Potente, Pompino and Good
Hope. He closed equal favorite In the
betting with Potente and never looked
dangerous. The latter horse picked up 122
pounds, winning in a gallop by three
lengths from Pompino, in 1:28, a remark
ably tine performance, and It is to be re
gretted the Racine gelding did not start in
last Saturday's big race.
Although the track was very muddy and
rain fell at intervals,- four favorites
splashed in ahead of their fields.
A said fate befell Sea Bass, favorite for
the. two-year-old scramble. The half
sister to Recreation was bumped into and
injured in the shoulder during a false
breakaway, the accident compelling her
to be left at the post. The winner turned
up in Mamie Hildreth, a 15 to 1 shot,
which downed Irate and Mrs. Brunell
very cleverly the last sixteenth.
The erratic San Tomas started in the
opening five and a half furlong scramble
In the name of Fred Edwards, opening a
2 to 1 favorite over the field. His price
went to 5, when It was swiped to 16 to 5,
Mountebank enjoying the honors of favor
tlsm. Buchanan got San Tomas away
well and the colt proved a wonder In the
mud, running like a ghost. He tried to
bolt in the stretch, just scaling the outside
fence, and then won easily from the fa
vorite. Morella, against which 25 to 1
to show was laid, ran third.
Barney Schreiber's fast marÂ© Miss Mar
ion made her reappearance In the sprint
which followed, over the Futurity course,
ruling a pronounced choice in the ring.
Leading almost from the start, she was
hard ridden at the end to beat the 20 to 1
outsider El Mido.
It did not look very rosy for the back
ers of Essence during the early stages of
the seven furlong run. The Burns & Wat
erhouse entry could not keep up, but stood
a lot of riding, and ridden out earned the
verdict from Tekla by a couple of lengths.
Matt Hogan, after chasing out in front
with Choteau, died away to nothing.
Eddie Ross landed the mile and a fur
long run with Malay. Dr. Rowell's horse
had not shown much form of late, but his
well-known liking for mud made him an
equal favorite with Tappan. Morse,
astride the 20 to 1 outsider Uarda, came
dangerously close to stealing a march on
the field. Getting away in the lead .it
took the hardest sort of riding on the
part of Ross to overtake and beat her a
neck on the wire. Castake ran third."

RATE FOR LIGHTS
WILL BE MODIFIED
Supervisors' Committee and Mayor
Phelan Decide on a Maximum
Flat Bate With No :
Discount.
The Supervisors' Artificial Lights Com
mittee met yesterday In conference with
Mayor Phelan and the representatives of
several light companies for the purpose of
considering certain modifications in the
electric light rates adopted as a result of
the recent investigation. It was decided
to fix a maximum flat rate for electric arc
lights, instead of the high rate subject to
discount as heretofore adopted, and to
permit the discount to apply only to In
candescent lights. No definite conclusion
was arrived at, though the commute*
rather favored an Increase from $1 75 to
$1 95 on electric lamps" lit until midnight.
President Crockett of the San Francisco
Company made a plea that the rate of 11
cents for Incandescent lights In the out
side districts be raised to 15 cents, which,
he claimed, was the maximum rate In
other large cities. Manager E. J. Martin
of the Harbor and Western Power Com
pany said that the $175 rate for electric
lamps until 12 o'clock In the downtown
districts was a competitive one; that in
Oakland, where there was no competition,
the rate Is $2 To,' and in Stockton 52 50. He
argued that the 12 o'clock light cost more
than $1 75, and that the rate should be si
fixed as to comprehend every system ex
cept the direct Edison system. The mat
ter of .depreciation, he said,, had not been
taken into account; nor the loss In thÂ« dis
tribution of current. in the outlying dU
trlcts. '
A. M. Hunt of the Independent Light
and Power Company stated that if the
San Francisco Company had proper trans
formers it would not sustain bo great *
loss in distribution, and that If the 11-cent
rate was adopted it would force the com
pany to secure. a better system to reduce
the waste. to a minimum.
W." G. Summerhayes of the Mutual *7om "
pany s said , that his Â« company charged , In
some cases' sl 50 for 12 o'clock lights, and
made money at that rate. -Â¦ â Â¦ .
: The committee will meet again for the
purpose of arranging a proper modification
of the rates, which will be resubmitted at
next Monday's meeting of the board la
the form of an amendment.

Fly-Casters Swap Many New Tales
Over the Banquet Board During
Their Bimonthly Dinner.
About fifty members of the San Fran
cisco Fly Casting Club met at dinner last
night In a downtown rotlsserte and told
fish stories and discussed an elaborate
repast. It was the bimonthly banquet of
the well-known organization and the
downpour and other attractions did not
keep the members from attending.
An excellent orchestra furnished popu
lar music during the evening and the men
who search the streams for festive- trout
and other, speckled beauties raised their
voices in song. | Between courses the Jolly
devotees of Izaak Walton swapped fish
stories, and although Home of the tales
told would have made Munchausen look
like a selling-plater the narrator's verac
ity was never questioned as his neighbor
at the table had one to tell, that was
equally strong. Attorney Alexander T.
Vogelsang tried to make C. H. Young ba
lieve that he had enjoyed great fishing in
the Dead Sea; "Doc" Watt impressed on
his auditors that in years past he won
many trophies in drop-line tournaments;
President W. D. Mansfield said he thought
he could cast a fly over the Spreckels
building If Â¦ the wind favored htm, and
other members were prepared with simi
lar assertions. The vÃostonian Quartet,
composed of Messrs. Kelly, Wendell,

heard in tuneful selections. Seated at the

Influence in this way on so many of thÂ«
European heresies or the middle ages.
.The great and merited fame of Fitzger
ald s Rubaiyat has made one of the Per
sian poets a true English classic, and
though this version of Omar is so free as
to be a paraphrase rather than a transla
tion, yet the voluptuous and semt-myttl
cal beauty of Fitzgerald's lines la not a
bad representation of the Persian lyrics.
It would be interesting to study at larga
the other famous lyric poets â H&flz. At
tar, Saadi and the restâ but to-day we
must concentrate our attention rather
upon the great epic writer whose work
precedes and outshines them all.
We have seen how Persian literature Is
divided Into three distinct periods, and
how the third or modern period begins
about the year 1000 A. D. with the work
of Firdusl. L*t us look for a moment at
the life of this famous author. Flrdust
was born In a small village near Tus. In
the year WO of our era. Already a poet
of the name of Dekiki had undertaken
to weave the old Persian traditions into
a continuous narrative, but had left hi 3
work unfinished. .Inspired by this exam
ple, the young Flrdusi set himself to re
cover the ancient legends of his land.
Much he found written In books, much
he took down from the oral traditions
among the people, for the people of Iran
had not forgotten the glorious deeds of
their ancestors, and, indeed, to this day
these traditions are handed down by
memory from father to son. This great
body of legends the poet wrought into a
long narrative of some 80,000 couplets.
Having got this vast work well under
way, he set out for the court. There is
a curious story of an adventure on the
road. In a garden near the capital he
happened to come upon three court poeta
drinking wine and amusing themselves
with extemporizing verse. Thinking to
have sport with the stranger, they asked
him to cap a stanza for them. Choosing
a most difficult rhyme, they each pro
nounced a line, whereupon, to their
amazement, the newcomer added a fourth,
which contained a historical allusion quite
unknown to them. As a reward, they in
troduced him to the court, where Flrdusl
soon won the favor of Shah Mahmud.
Never had such verse as his been heard,
and all at first were glad to do him honor.
In the end, however. Jealousy and malice
found him. He was accused of slighting
the Mohammedan faith for the ancient
religion of his fathers; he was cheated
of his promised payment, and. In disgust,
having added a few lines of bitter satire
against the shah at tbe end of his com
pleted poem, he fled from the court and
hid himself in his native town. Here he
died a poor man, but tradition declares
that the shah repented at last and that
the messenger bearing his bounty entered
the gate of the town at the very mo
ment when the poet's body was being car
ried out to his last resting place.
The epic of Flrdusi. "The Shah Na
meh, or Book of Kings." Is well described
by its name. It Is a continuous narrative
of Persian history from Gayumers, the
fabulous first man and king of the race,
down to the invasion of the Arabs In the
seventh century. A great number of epi
sodes are woven Into the thread, and In
deed the poem Is bewildering by Its very
richness of material. In plan It is thus
quite different from the epics of Greece
and India and Germany, each of which
is made to center about one historic event.
Yet If the "Shah Nameh" lacks the unity
of the "Iliad" or the "Ramayana," It haa
another kind of unity of Its own.
We have seen that the old religion of
Iran was strongly duallstlc. and this dual-
Ism Is the central and harmonizing motive
of Flrdusl's poem. Here again we see the
everlasting conflict of light and darkness,
of truth and falsehood, waging on the
earth. History and mythology have been
inextricably confused. The old mythi
cal powers of light are now the Persian
people themselves, while the princes of
darkness are the aborigines and Tura
nians with whom Iran was continually at
war. This religious background lends a
certain moral earnestness to the poem,
and is one of Its most pleasing features.
Flrdusi has changed the fatth of his fath
ers Into history and woven it Into the very
texture of his plot: the doctrine of Mo
hammed, of which he was nominally a
follower, he has for the most part avoid
ed, saving himself by giving a certain
deistlc tone to the work. At bottom fate Is
the power that Flrdusl really worships â
fate that mocks human affairs and raises
up the mighty only in the end to toss them,
into the dust. At the close of each epoch
of events he Is wont to add some such sad
moral as thiss "Look ye! "Who could at
tain a glory like to this man'a? He hath
shown to men how riches are won, but h*
hath not enjoyed riches. â¢ The world Is
but a passing dream: neither happiness
nor sorrow endures." And again: "O
world, cease to raise us up only to gather
us as a harvest at thÂ© end! If thou wish
est that we vanish away, why, then, raise
us up? Thou exaltest a man above the
firmament, and straightway hnrlest him
under the obscure earth."

tempt was made to get her aboard. The
weight was too much for the hoisting
gear, however, and as the launch broke
away she almost tore the davits out of
the ship.' The men on deck threw a rope
to the watchman and he managed to clanj
ber up the Hancock's side. In a few m'n
utes the launch went down stern first, *nd
although a half-dozen boats were out
grappling for her yesterday no trace of
her could be found.
"When the Hancock was being over
hauled and made into a model transput
the new launch was added to her outfit.
Like the Honcock. she was, the finest
thing of her kind afloat, and all the other
transports envied Captain Struve his fine
launch. A few days ago while lying at the
Folaom street float one of the tubes in
the launch's boiler blew out and several
men were scalded. The necessary repairs
were made and the launch was again in
service, but only for a couple of days, and
then came this laat mishap. After th-s
day's work was done the launch was made
fast to the transport and allowed to drift
astern. When the tide turned and the
ship began to swing the boat came around
under the transport's stern and in a very
short space of time she stove holes in her
self on the propeller blades and went
down.
The destination of the Italian man-of
war Calabria has been changed. Ins tend
of coming to San Francisco she is going
to Japan and from there to China. The
Italian Consul received a telegraphic order
yesterday to forward all mail for the
cruiser to Yokohama. Expected trouble
In the Orient over the Chinese question
has called the Calabria to Japan, so tho
Italian colony will not get Its expected
treat.
The British ship Annie Thomas is now
out 221 days from Cardiff for Acapulco.
and yesterday 70 per c*Â»nt was offered to
reinsure the vessel and cargo. The only
thing against the risk is the fact that the
ship has a coal cargo. If she has not been
afire then there is no reason why tlii
Thomas should rot show up all right. Ehe
is a notoriously slow ship, and again
everything is against her making time in
the Gulf of Panama. The schooner Sophie
Sutherland, owned here, is now out seventy
days from El Triumfo for this port, but
no anxiety is felt over her non-arrival;
fo shipping men reason that the 70 per
cent on the Annie Thomas is a good gam
ble.

7Steamer Movements.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, March t.â Conditions were
mixed end the movement of prices was very
much confused on the Stock Exchange to-day.
Fentlment Is correspondingly conflicting among
the speculative contingent. The situation may
be beet described as one of waiting on the
part of the believers in higher prices. Those
having faith in a decline took advantage of
the hesitation of the bulls and the entire lack
of outside interest In the stock market to
make vigorous attacks at vulnerable spots in
the market. The results on the whole were
favorable to the bears. They were very dili
gent in tetklng out stocks which were unpro
tected by supporting orders and in offering
them down belcw the price level where selling
orders were known to be placed in the stocks
for the purpose of having 1<jÂ»Â»Â«s on any sud
cen decline. ThÂ» sudden fall In prices of stocks
thus selected and equally sudden and violent
rallies gave the key to the character of this
selling. Tlie flurry in the rat* for call money
.In the late afternoon to 4 per cent was a
farortna; factor for the bears, but the actual
effect was very small. The early tendency to
!adrance in the railroad list was checked by
the maneuvers cf the bears and tb* more
notable advances were about wiped out. The
railroad list yielded unwillingly and only to a
Flight degree In spite of the light demand and
a sprinkling of gains was retained at the
close. Very earnest efforts were made to
weaken Sngar, but the utmost that could be
achieved was a three-point decline, offerings
cf tb* stock being comparatively light. Third
Avenue was strong, rising an extreme C% and
Imparting tyrspathetla strength to the other
local traction stocks. The most notable ex
amplee of the bear tactics were furnished by
the. international paper stocks, the common
falling 4% and rallying :%. and the preferred
falling 7% and rallying 4; Pressed Steel Car.
which dropped Â«% and rallied 6: American
Hoop, which fell 2 and rallied 1%. and Standard
KopÂ« end Its bold issue, which were raided
down from 2% to S points, with rallies ex
tending from 1 to nearly 4 points, and People's
O*Â«. which fell 1% and rallied 2%. Practically
all the iron and eteel stocks were down from
1 to 2 points and many recovered a good por
tion of the loss and there were other less
striking examples all through the list of spec
ialties. In the railroad list St. Paul, Burling
tun ar.d Baltimore and Ohio showed an ex
treme decline of a point or over, but the net
changes In the railroads are small throughout.'
It 1a evident that the final disposition of the
financial bill by Congress is awaited by the
bull contingent, who are generally confident
that the provisions for additional bank circu
lation will be enacted into law and will re-
FUlt in a notable expansion of the currency.
The large buying of Government bonds by na
if nal banks all ov<>r the country and the ex
j^-rt estimates which ar* current of the profit
<;fi>r*<i on circulation by the new provisions
pre the grounds of this oonfldenc*. Meantime
the money market is working constantly closer
md the favorable factors In the outlook are
ignored In the fear that the available supply
of money will not bridge the interval until the
expected relief.

BOSTON, March B.â The quiet tone in the
last week continued to pervade the wool market
here. Ohio and Michigan X and 'XX 'wools
hare' sold In small" quantities. The calls for
quarter, three-eighths and half-blood stock has
considerably, narrowed. The prices asked for
territory wools for the first of the year have
been shaded and bids on round lots will, with
out doubt, bring a further weakening, although
holders are not taking much lower prices on
their wools. Ohio XX and above are nominal
at about 34@35c, while about 37Â©3Sc will cover
sales of No. 1. Quarter-blood unwashed fleeces
are good calls, while the market for three

NOTEâ The high and low waters occur at

CHICAGO, March 6.â When the day opened
In the wheat pit there was a bare prospect â
nothing of Influence either wayâ and accord
ingly May wheat opened unchanged from yes
terday at Cj%c. So dull wag the situation thatÂ»
the attempt of a discouraged long to dispose
of 250,000 bushels of wheat, which went in the
course of an hour through a score of small
hands, sent the price of May to 65% c. At this
point the signal service prediction of a cold
wave and the Liverpool advance in spot wheat
came as a tonic which Imparted firmness and
moderate activity. Shorts, led by St. Louis in
terests, covered and May rallied to 66c. On
prcnt-taUtng which met the bulge 6Â»%@65%c
was touched, but the market rebounded, re
ceiving further help from a report of a good
Inquiry at New York, the firmness of the
Northwest and a pessimistic view of crop con
ditions In some sections. May rallied to 66% c
and closed strong %Â©VÂ£c over yesterday at ;
66<tf'66Hc. . j
The corn market was strong and moderately
active. Country offerings were very small and
receipts light and apparently the recent at
tempt to break the market had been aban- \
doned, for the gain shown in opening figures
found few sellers and shorts were disposed |to :
cover. May closed at the top, %c over yes
terday. -
The strength of corn lent enough of Its In
fluence to the neglected oats market to In
cline that very dull cereal toward firmness.
May closed %c over yesterday at . 23V4c.
The provision trade experienced the dullest
day In a very dull fortnight, but the declining i
tendency due to a weak hog market and a
poor demand was . checked by the strength of
corn and the dose was steady. May pork
closed Be over yesterday. May lard 2%c up
and May ribs 2%c higher.

FIGHT CONVICT-MADE GOODS.
Western Manufacturers Hope for Be
lief FTom an Unfair Competition.
A movement Is on foot headed by tha
Manufacturers' and Producers* Associa
tion to revive the crusade against the ship
ping into this State goods made by con
victs in prisons of other States of the
Union. When this body was organized the
matter of convict-made goods was about
the first to be investigated, and a vast
amount of data was gathered showing
that the State of California was and Â«3
the dumping ground of the products of all
the prisons in the country. Efforts were
made then to have the national authori
ties pass laws by which the West would
be protected from convict competition,
against 'free labor, but the effort failed.
The matter was not allowed to rest, for
as soon as Congressman Julius Kahn
went to Washington he started the ball
rolling with another bill which the man
ufacturers of the West appreciated, and
urged the other Pacific Coast representa
tives In Congress to support. The effort
does not end here, for the association has
decided to call upon all of the commer
cial Industrial and labor union bodies of
the State to rally to Its support.
road, and will occupy the same field to the
north as does the Haywards line to the
south. Before the Haywards line was built
there was nothing but unbroken fields to
San Leandro. . Now the country is thickly
settled. The. same thing can t>e done to
the north, and the road will make a pa
tronage for Itself that will be legitimate
and profitable.
"The road will be built just as soon as
we get the franchises. We asked for that
in Contra Costa County, first because we
expected that it would take longer to se
cure that portion. We will ask for those'
in Berkeley, Emeryville and Oakland just
as soon as we are assured of getting that
in Contra Costa County. We will probably
locate the power-house In Oakland. [ As
for the line into Oakland, we will have to
take some other streets after we reach
West Berkeley, but there are many rootea
that can be. secured. The total length of
the line will be about fifteen miles, and it
will coat about $6000 a mile to build.
"Of course, the route of our line shows
that we will go to Point Richmond, but
the Santa Fe system Is not behind our
line, and neither is the Southern Pacific.
We may get some patronage from that
source, but our line will be independent. 1
OAKLAND, March 6.â The applica
tion of William G. Henshaw and
A. S. Macdonald of this city for a
franchise for an* electric railroad
between Point Richmond and San
Pablo and Oakland, as was told exclusive
ly In The Call this morning, means much
to Oakland. It means a definite connec
tion between the present terminus of the
Santa Fe Railroad system at Point Rich
mond and the city of Oakland. It means
a, solution of the question that has been
so often and so seriously raised in this
city, "How will the Santa Fe reach Oak
land?" It certainly will furnish a pas
senger connection between Point Rich
mond and Oakland for the Santa Fe sys
tem and can be made to furnish a freight
connection should the road bo wish.
.So the Importance of. the move Is ob
vious to Oakland. No matter whether an
Independent line, built and controlled by
local capitalists or whether t directly
backed by the Santa Fe Railroad system,
It will be the connecting link between
Oakland and Point Richmond for that
road for a long while.
A. S. Macdonald, one of those in whose
name the franchise was asked, finally said
to-day that the road was an independent
affair, backed by neither the Santa Fe
nor the Southern Pacific systems. But
while Mr. Macdonald would not admit
anything but Independent support for his
proposed. road he did admit that it would
be for a while, at least, a connection be
tween . the Santa Fe terminus at Point
Richmond and Oakland.
An Inspection of the map that shows the
route of the proposed electric railroad will
make It rather difficult for people to be
lieve that it has not some very close con
nection with the Santa Fe system. The
most important part of the line runs in a
loop around the big peninsula known as
the potrero of San Pablo, of which Point
Richmond Is a projection into deep water.
i But not only does ..the proposed electric
line make a loop around the potrero, but
!it runs directly down Point Richmond
itself, to . the very ferry terminus of the
Santa Fe system. As Point Richmond and
the land for some little distance back Is
owned by the Santa Fe Railroad It Is
quite evident that It will be necessary to
secure the consent of the big railroad be
fore the electric railroad can construct Its
most important line.
It is so evident that the proposed elec
tric road will be constructed for the pur
pose principally of reaching Point Rich
mond and the Santa Fe terminus and that
It will draw its main source of revenue
from its connection with- that- terminus,
that no matter what the backing of the
road it becomes the Santa Fe's connection
with Oakland. -
This Is all that the people of Oakland
want to know and this The Call told them
before any other paper this morning.
The money necessary to construct the
line has all been secured, but the two
gentlemen who have asked for the fran
chise are amply able to raise the money
themselves without railroad or Eastern
backing. -
This Is the first appearance of both Mr.
Henshaw and Mr. Mncdonald as railroad
proprietors. Mr. Macdonald made his de- â¢
but as a railroad promoter by deftly and
successfully securing the rights of way
for the Santa Fe road f rom Â¦ Antloch to
Point Richmond, a piece of work which
he did to the satisfaction of the road. Mr.
Henshaw has long been Interested in
many enterprises In Oakland, but never hi
a railroad. A. S. Macdonald to-day made
a more detailed statement abqut his pro
posed railroad, saying:
"This will be an Independent line, and
It will be built just as soon as the fran
chises are granted. The road will be built
by the ones in v.-hose name the franchise
was asked, "William G. Henshaw an-J my
self. We believe there Is a legitimate lieM
for such a road, built and operated on thÂ«
same plan as the Oakland, San LeanUro
and Hay wards electric line. It- will not
be quite so long a line as the Haywards

UNNATURAL HUNGER
A Sure Sign of Hidden Dyspepsia.
"It was necessary to eat dinner at 11
o'clock" (says Mrs. C F. Oilman, 1131
Preston St.. Rockford, 111.), "in order to
have strength to prepare the noonday
mealfor the family.
"While I was drinking coffee I felt so
faint at n o'clock that I was unable to
proceed with the work unless I had
lunch. If I missed the 11 o'clock meal
I was attacked with a severe sick head-
ache.
"My complexion at that time was a
sight, great blotches appearine on my
face, and I was so* nervous I could
sleep but a few minutes at a time, and
would wake in the morning more tired
than when I went to bed.
"Our grocer called my attention one
day to Postum Cereal Coffee. This was
about three years ago. I immediately
quit the use of coffee and took up Pos-
ttim, having it prepared properly. The
change produced a remarkable result.
In a week or two I was. able to leave off
the H o'clock lunch and take my dinner
in the regular way with the rest of the
family. My blotchy complexion disap-
peared and a natural complexion took
its place. Now I can go from morning
until night without a meal, if I desire,
and no headache or inconvenience of
any kind appears. I sleep sound as a
babyÂ» and my kidney trouble, which was
more than serious, has entirely disap-
peared. 'i'*j' ;:
"A lady friend was recommended to
try Postum, and a short time after told
me fhe was disgusted with it for it had
no ta?tc. I asked her, if she boiled it
carefully fifteen minutes after the real
bubbling commenced. Shesaid no. and
in reply to another question said she
used only one heaping teaspoonful to
the cup. I explained to her that she
must use two heaping teaspoons to the
cup and let it boil long enough. The
next time I saw her she said she used
Postum regularly and \ liked it very
rhuch indeed, and that it had made a
great change in her health and the
health of one or two members of her
family.'.' Â¦ . Â¦
It'seems plain, from this experience;
that one is justified in the inference that
coffee is an actual poison to* many hu-
man bciofs. and s e*se * s "P a l sorts of dis-
eases. The remedy is plain enoughâ
to abandon the coffee and use Postum
Food Coffee, which is- sold by. all. gro-
cers at 15 and 25 cents a package.

David Meier, a Sick Soldier, Arrested
on a Charge of Grand Lar
ceny. : di^~f.
David Meier, an invalided soldier from
Manila, was taken from the hospital at
the Presidio yesterday by Detectives

City Prison on a charge of grand larceny.
Meier arrived on the transport Grant on

Young Raabe told his father of his ex
perience, and they called at police head
quarters and wanted Meier arrested with
out the formality of a warrant, but they
were not successful, and had to wait until
yesterday morning. :r. . .. j
Meier was taken before Chief Sullivan,
to whom he made- a statement that Raabe
had been playing with Â¦ the dice and
winning before he Joined the game. It
was a case of pure luck with him. He
was seriously ill and thought his arrest
was an outrage. â¢
Chief Sullivan<went with Meier to Judge
Cabaniss and explained the facts to tho
Judge, suggesting that the warrant
against Meier should be withdrawn. The
Judge Bald it was not In his power to do
so, but in the circumstances fixed tho ball
at $100, which was promptly deposited,

ANIMALS SHOULD BE
TREATED WITH KINDNESS
Professor Norris Gives Some Sound
Advice to Amateur Dog Pan
. ciers â How to Train a Â¦
Canine.
Professor Norris of Norrls & Rowe's big
trained animal shows, which Is crowding
the Mechanics' Pavilion every afternoon
and evening, has some sound advice to
give owners of dumb beast pets. He has
handled hundreds of animals In his career
and speaks from experience when he
states that the only way to teach them
tricks is by kindness and patience.
"Of all the animals that inhabit the
earth there are few, if any, subjected to
the variety of treatment visited upon the
dog," said Professor Norris. "Probably
the horse's is the nearest approach to the
dog's life, but the simile Is hardly paral
lel, owing to the matter of dollars and
cents and value, which occasionally stay 3
the hand of a cruel owner for fear that
the result of an exhibition of temper
would make sad Inroads on the pocketr
book in case the animal had to be re
placed. While in many instances the
values of dogs have reached almost fab
ulous sums owing to superior breeding,
bench show or field dualities, yet after
many years of practically educating the
public by exhibition or otherwise, people
exist who only know a dog as simply a
common animal with four legs, which
barks, occasionally bites, and is a pet or
a nuisance as the case may be. The field
of usefulness occupied by the dog Is very
extensive. Its scope depending much on
the variety, its education and subsequent
treatment. â¢ : â¢
Happily, of late years the advancement
of civilization has developed a strong sen
timent in favor of the merciful treatment
of dumb animals and condemning unnec
essary harshness or punishment, its gen
eral effect being a more useful treatment
of dogs and a disposition on the part of
the owner or handler to give man's best
friend opportunities hitherto denied him.
The puppy should be educated in a firm
yet quiet way, the trainer taking pains
to Impress upon the pupil the value of
obedience as a cardinal virtue in the ca
nine reportolre. -While some people take
a fiendish delight in teasing a dog, It ii
not to be expected that they realize what
they are doing, or a different course would
be pursued. A dog should be educated to
become 1 accustomed to the chain only for
purposes of temporary restraint; it bofnÂ«
understood that on practical occasions
perfect freedom Is conducive to good
health and amiable disposition, perma
nent restraint generally resulting In sour
dispositions, which could easily be avoided
if proper methods were employed.
WITH A CARVING
KNIFE SHE CUT
OFF LOVER'S EAR
C. Kruse Seriously Slashed
by Benedicto Guerra
Near Pleasanton.
PLEASANTON, March 6. â Because he
boxed her left ear in a fit of drunken
anger, Benedlcto Guerra, an . Indian
woman, chopped off Charles Kruse's
right ear with a carving knife. The In
furiated woman wielded the big sharp
blade with such accurate aim that she
also sliced off a small' section of Kruse's
cheek. She will probably have to answer
for p.n assault with a deadly weapon, as
Kruse Is not Inclined to press a more
serious charge. Â¦' Â¦ ' ' '
Kruse, who claims to be a German, has
been living with Benedlcto Guerra for
some time near the Indian rancheria, a
short distance from- Pleasanton. It ap
pears that last Friday night, during one
of their midnight orgies, when consider
able cheap red wine was consumed, Kruse
struck the Guerra "woman, felling her to
the floor, and knocked out three of her
front teeth. ' 'Â¦
Last night another â¢ row occurred be
tween the couple, and Kruse boxed one
of the woman's ears, when she hurriedly
left the room and returning with a large
carving knife smote her assailant, cutting
off his right ear and slashing both his
cheeks. . , . Â¦ Â¦
She was arrested to-day and her bail

SCORES OF CONVERTS
MADE BY BOY PREACHER
Master Jack Cook Doing Phenomenal
Work at the Howard-Street
. , ,:. M. E. Church.
Master Jack Cook, the boy evangelist,
who is conducting revival services at
Howard-street M. E. Church, is nightly
crowding the edifice and winning many
converts to his cause. Despite the rain
last night a large crowd waited in front
of the church as early as 6 o'clock to gain
admittance. The services lasted -intl!
nearly midnight, and the boy preacher,
aided by his father, Henry Cook, and his
brother, Hayden Cook, aroused great re
ligious fervor among the audience.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson opened last
night's service with prayer, and at its
conclusion -young Cook devoted half .an
hour to answering complex questions on
the philosophy of the Bible. He chose hls>
text from a suggestion given him by one
of those present, and then delivered an
eloquent sermon, in which he appealed
for converts. He succeeded In inducing
twenty-one converts to. step before the
altar and he then led them in prayer.
The young preacher's services are great
ly in, demand. Committees from Fresno,
Sacramento and Woodland have appealed
to him to come to their respective towns
and lead revival services." Master Cook
will probably remain at the Howard-street
M. E. Church, for. another week. ;' *-"

Chief Dunn of the Chinese Bureau has

him by Lawyer Costello. A Chinaman

Mr. Dunn proved that he had sent an

them were sirk. and that Ho Mun had
denied being sick, because he was afraid

GADSKI AND BISPHAM
IN CHARMING CONCERT
Mr. Damrosch Analyzes and Illus
trates Wagner's "Tannhauser,"
Assisted by the Two
Great Stars.
Although Mr. Walter Damroseh's prelim
inary recital prefaced the present series
of "Wagnerian contorts most . agreeably,
public Interest centered In the reappear
ance of Madame Gadski, which took place
at the California Theater yesterday af
ternoon. In point of artistic Importance,
however, our first hearing of David Bis
pham must take priority.
The cpncert was devoted to an exposi
tion of "Tannhauser," and it was an
agreeable Â¦ surprise to many to find that
Mr. Damro^h again contributed a verbal
analysis ana elucidation of the composer's
art and purpose. This introduction of fa
miliar talks by Mr. Damrosch adds much
to the pleamre that is to be derived from
listening to his admirable illustrations on
the piano and to the singing of Madame
Gadski, Mr. Bispham and Mr. Schott.
The conduct of the concerts Is as inter
esting as it is novel, and the combination
of discourse and vocal illustration is a
substitute for complete operatic treatment
more satisfying than one could anticipate.
Mr. Damrosch compasses on the piano a
degree of orchestral effect that is posi
tively astounding. His execution is dis
tinguished as much by delicacy and a feel
ing for the spiritual as it is by breadth
and vigor. He is not less happy In inter
preting Wagner's exquisite treble sugges
tions of the supernatural and abstract
than-ln the forceful rendering of his stur
dier dramatic themes. ; He alternately
narrates,' declaims, muses, storms, pleads,
defies, laments. In short, runs the gamut
of dramatic and emotional expression.
"Tannhauser" is lacking In point of
technical interest as compared with the
later Wagnerian music-dramas, of which
the complex thematic treatment Is sus
ceptible of more copious analysis; but Mr.
Damrosch traced the thread of the story
and its musical eetting most delightfully,
and again won the auditors by his sincer
ity and charm of manner.
Madame Gadski was graciously wel
comed and sang her portions of the opera
with admirable art. Once regarded only
as a lyric soprano, she has essayed the
heavier dramatic roles with such success
that to-day, although not the first among
the great- Wagnerian artists, she has at
least a versatility that has rarely been
equaled by a German singer.
â¢ It may be said of Madame Gadski that
she is not too faithfully German. The art
that she brings to the music of Wagner
is not so much of a special school as it is
comprehensive, universal. She has com
mand not only of declamatory enuncia
tion, but possesses a beautiful legato style
and a well-defined mezza voce.
Her voice this year seems to be more
symmetrical and the Insecurity of her at
tack In the upper register, which was no
ticeable when. she sang here before, seems
to have disappeared. There is the same
wavering of the pitch that is characteris
tic of her singing, but she compensates
for this fault by abundant artistic quali
ties. Her intense dramaticism is delight
ful, for it springs from a genuine tem
perament and Is utterly different from the
artificial fervor of so many of the Ger
mans.
Mr. Bispham's singing is an example of
what the perfection of method can
achieve when taken Jn conjunction with
fundamental qualities of. more than or
dinary worth. In him the artist is para
mount. .One. finds In him more than
aught else the masterful grasp of the in
tellectual purpose of what he sings. His
voice is naturally full and- resonant, his
art makes it. rich and sonorous. His shad
ing and use of tone color is nothing short
of marvelous, his control Is wonderful and
his phrasing absolute perfection. He has
the mesa dl voce. a generous volume and
equable tone quality. He is unsensatlonal,
sincere; conscious of his powers no doubt
and conscious too perhaps of his defects,
which. If he have any, he cleverly con
ceals with his consummate art. And
that Is art.
Anton Schott sang excerpts from the
muplc of "Tannhauser" at times most ef
fectively. He did particularly well in the
Venus song and the narrative at the end
of the opera, but aside from the fact that
he is very much past his prime there is
evident in his singing of passages that
call for varied vocalization an effort at
color and expression that is rather more
studied than refined.
The Interest and success of the season
promise to grow with each succeeding
concert, " PORTER G ARXETT.

â¢ : The " management ' of -the Columbia- Ath
letic Club Is pursuing a. "policy which will
not be approved by the,follo"wers of pugil
ism ih T thls 'city. Not satisfied 'with hav
ing a monopoly on the small glove con
tests and reaping a harvest through their
semi-monthly boxing exhibitions, the club
management Is attempting to defeat the
plans of its only rival, the National Club,
by T>utbldding it and Influencing boxers
who have entered Into contracts with the
latter club to break them.
A flagrant instance of this conduct was
brought to light yesterday when "Paddy"
Purtell, the' pugilist, refused point- blank
to flght before the National Club, unless
the winner received 60 per cent of the
gross receipts. Manager Glbbs declined
to enter into such an agreement and hotly
told the dictating fighter that he would
not hold the fight on such terms. It was
then that Purtell let the. cat out of the
bag. He haughtily announced that he did
not care a "rap" what the National Club
did, as the Columbia Club had offered
that amount and he would flght under its
auspices. Manager Gibbs was thunder
struck at this statement, and he went In
search of Manager Crowley and demanded
an explanation. A heated discussion fol
lowed, but nothing came of It.
Purtell has acted unwisely In the mat
ter. He came here under contract to flght
before the National Club, but without
even a "thank you" throws it over for
higher money. The Columbia Club Is even
greater . at fault. According to one fol
lower of the pastime, the woods are full
of fighters and that club could easily have
matched two good men without encroach
ing upon the preserves of the National
Club.
"Biddy" Bishop will take "Tonng" Peter
Jackson to Sacramento to-day and place

The controversy . over f the errors and
omissions recently ! discovered in th*Â». rec

was satisfactorily arranged yesterday by
the latter official.* He offered to deposit a
sum â¢; equal to the ,. amounts ; not ; marked
paid on the assessment* roll but for which
taxpayers â¢. hold receipted bills. This will
not be necessary, however; as the sum of
$481,- which he deposited in the city tre&s T

ACCIDENT TO A STRANGER.
George Braham Walks Into an Ele-

George F. Graham, a recent arrival
from Seattle, fell down an elevator shaft
in front of the Young Men's Christian
Association building last night and was
severely injured. The unfortunate man
is troubled with defective eyesight and
walked in thtf shaft unconscious of his
danger. His groans attracted the atten
tion of a citizen, who at once informed
Police Officer Keyes. The latter had him
removed to the Receiving Hospital, where
an examination disclosed that he had sus
tained a severe injury to the left side, a
contusion of the scalp, lacerated wound of
the left cheek, besides having both wrists
sprained. Graham claims that there was
no guard around the elevator, but this
is denied by the manager of the building.

BOXERS in all their varieties took
part in the Olympic Athletic Club
tournament last night, and showed
the sport in all Its phases. There
were no knockouts, but in four of
the bouts the seconds threw up
the sponge, thus- saving their men from
needless punishment. The righting in the
majority of the ten bouts was of the hur
ricane order, the boxers standing up
gamely under the most trying conditions.
John L. Scholes of Toronto, Canada,
champion 125-pound amateur boxer of
America, England and Canada, was the
first of the Eastern champions to appear.
He created a most favorable impression
by his manly bearing in the ring, and was
given an ovation when he appeared first,
and another and. if anything, a more cor
dial one. after he displayed his remark
able prowess as a boxer when he defeated
F. Macdonald of the Reliance Athletic
Club. Macdonald is a stocky boxer of the
Sharkey type. He rushed at Scholes,
head down and swinging wildly, but was
unable to make any stand against the
clever Easterner. The latter is tall and
rather slightly built, being reminiscent of
Kid McCoy. He is a master In the art
of jabbing. An elastic bandage over the
elbow Joint of his left arm heightens the
Impression that he is not so strong as he
m He landed at will on Macdonald In the
first round. The Reliance Club man was
swinging all the time trying to place an
effective blow, but to no avail. Twice
Scboles slipped on the floor of the elevated
ring, and the admirers of Macdonald
thought their man was doing some effec
tive work. This idea was dispelled in the
ANOTHER HOLE
PUNCHED IN THE
NEW CHARTER
Stenographers Are Governed
by State Laws Which
Fix Their Fees.
A hole of considerable size was knocked
In the' charter yesterday by a decision
handed" down by Superior Judge Seawell
in the suit- instituted by Luke Kavanagh.
stenographer of Department 6, to compel
Treasurer Brooks to pay him the fees pro
vided for by the State laws. The court
holds that criminal cases are exclusively
a matter of State concern and that tha
city and county representatives exceeded
their authority when they incorporated in
the charter a provision directly affecting:
the preservation of records of the trials
of criminals, in which the city and county
has no interest other than it has In com
mon with all the people of the State in
upholding: the administration of the laws.
In passing on the issues raised In the
case Judge Seawell, In part, said:
The question presented, for determination is
whether in thia city and county section 274 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. Â«o far as it pro-,
vides for the compensation of reporters in crim
inal cases, has been superseded by the section
of \he charter fixing' stenographer's fees.
While it may be conceded that a provision In
a charter not relating to municipal affairs may
be valid in the absence of a general law upon
the subject, if there is such a general law, the
charter must yield to the general law.
Criminal cases are exclusively a matter of
State concern. They are prosecuted in the
name and by the authority of the people of the
State. A particular county or city and county
has no Interest In them other than it has In
common with all the people of the State In up
holding the administration of the laws. .
It may be observed that the section of the
charter under consideration' does not fix the
salary of reporters in the criminal departments
of the Superior Court at any definite sum, but
merely declares that th#y shall each receive an
annual salary not exceeding $2400. If any board
or officer has the power under the charter to
determine the amount within this maximum
limit it does not appear to have been exer
cised.
Again, the section of the charter, under con
sideration provides for the payment of an an
nual salary to the "stwographers In the crim
inal departments of the Superior Court." Some
of the departments of that court are engaged
In the trial of both criminal and civil cases.
Only a small part of his time may- be occupied
in the trial of criminal cases, and yet the re
porter In such' a department Â¦ would receive his
annual salary and also fees in civil cases from
private litigants, while the reporter In a de
partment occupied with criminal cases exclu
sively would receive only the annual salary
For the reasons above stated, the demurrer to
the petition will -be overruled. Â¦
The overruling of 'defendant's demurrer
leaves him without further defense, and
the provision in the charter regulating
stenographers' fees is now a nullity

AUTHORITIES DECLARE
â¢ THE PLAGUE
Cannot Obtain a Footing: Here
Surgeon General W. X. Van
Reypen of the navy is an au
thority on the bubonic
plague. In discussing the
probability of its reaching
San Francisco he says: "The
climatic conditions of the
United States preclude the
possibility of the plague ever
getting within this country.
It is a- disease peculiar to the
Orient, and seldom, if ever,
attacks Europeans. The bu
bonic plague with reference
to the United States is like
beri beri. A Japanese vessel
once brought a number - of
cases of this disease to New
York. Those afflicted were
isolated and soon recovered.
There is absolutely no danger
of 'the plague ever getting
here."
The acting, surgeon general
of the army,- Colonel Charles
H. Alden, says: "The quar
antine service is so efficient
that the bubonic plague could
never obtain a foothold in the
United States, even though
the conditions were favorable.
I don't know of a single case
of plague in the United States.
It is a disease which flourishes
only where there is dirt and
filth."

Sirs. Erickson Vainly Attempts to
Commit Suicide in the City

While temporarily Insane from the tf-

middle-aged woman, last night made two
attempts to' commit suicide in the City
Prison. Yesterday afternoon the woman
was arrested on a charge of drunkenness
and placed In the cell set apart for in
ebriated females. Several hours later
ehe securely lied Â«. ribbon around her
threat and vainly endeavored to strangle
herf^lf. The screams of another inmate
of the cell attracted the attention of a
trilst y. who hastily summoned Turnkey
I Â»onohue and Desk Sergeant Lindheimer.
Thpy quickly opened the cell door and re
moved the ribbon from Mrs. Erickson's
throat.
â¢ Shortly afterward she secured another
pl*-cf of ribbon and again tried to strangle
herself. When discovered her tongue was
Â¦protruding and she otherwise seemed in
thf* throes of death. She was hastily re
nioved to the Receiving Hospital in the
patrol wagon, where, under the treatment
of the surgeon on duty, she soon recov
ered. When questioned she answered in
coherently, and as it was evident that her
mind was tottering it was decided to
charge her with insanity. She was then
removed to the detention ward, pending
an examination by the Commissioners of
Lunacy as to her mental condition.

POLICE KEEPING
QUARANTINE GUARD
OVER CHINATOWN
Suspicious Death of a La
borer Beings Investigated
by Dr. O'Brien.
Some Doubt as to the Nature of the
Case, but the Locality Has
Been Isolated ' for
Safety's Sake.
Â«Â¦Â¦Â¦''.:'Â¦' .
What is thought to be the bubonic
plague, according to Health Officer
O'Brien, has been discovered in China
town. One Chinaman living at 10M Du
pont street succumbed to the disease late
last night. Immediately after his death
was reported to Chief of Police Sullivan
the Chief detailed all of the available
officers to exclude the whites from China
town. Strict orders were also given to
police officers to carefully guard the va
rious, streets leading to the Chinese
quarter to prevent all Chinese from leav
ing.
By these means the head of, the Police
Department, as well as the health author
ities, hope to prevent any spread of the
disease. .
That the plague existed in the Chinese
quarter was kept a secret until late last
night, when the Chinese laborer died sud
denly under suspicious circumstances. -
A police officer, suspecting that he was
a victim of the disease, at once notified
Health Officer O'Brien. Dr. O'Brien ex
amined the body and came to the con
clusion that the officer's suspicion's were
correct. He ordered a strict quarantine
of the house, after which he promptly
telephoned to Chief Sullivan.
. The Chief was attending a meeting of
the Police Commissioners when he re
ceived the message. Without waiting to
listen to the concluding words of an ad
dress which was being delivered by an at
torney, who with eloquence was vigor
ously endeavoring to save the star of an
offending policeman, Sullivan repaired to
his private office. He then sent for Cap
tain Wittman, who had been apprised of
the suspicious death of the Chinaman,
and hurriedly told him of the message he
had received from Dr. O'Brien.
The Chief was at first in favor of with
drawing his two squads from the Chinese
district, but as he feared that the rival
highbinders would take advantage of the
situation and renew hostilities, he de
cided to keep them there. He, however,
promptly made out a detail of all his
available men to report at once to their
various captains for duty In Chinatown.
They will be assigned to positions along
the narrow streets leading into Chinatown
with strict instructions not to allow any
body to enter or leave. ,' ' ,_ /
The health authorities are satisfied that
they will succeed in wiping out the plague
before it can claim another victim. A
strict quarantine Â¦ will be established to
day and every, precaution will be taken to
prevent a spread of the disease.
The lodging-house where the unfortun
ate Chinese succumbed to the effects of
the so-called plague will be thoroughly
fumigated this morning and the occu
pants will not be' allowed outside.
Realizing the necessity for prompt ac
tion In preventing the disease from
spreading Chief Sullivan intends, if the
gravity of the situation requires It, to de
tail every member of the department to
guard the entrances to Chinatown and
prevent the Mongolians from leaving.

and fell heavily on his face. The sponge
went up this. time, as Milward was not fit
to continue.'
The lightweights showed some of the
best contests of the night. J. A. Rock, J.
E. Britt,. George Eager and W. J. Gooby
all showed to good advantage. Rock has
the self-possessed air of a professional
and he administered a lot of punishment
to James Mulligan. The latter was game
to the end and was on the aggressive the
major portion of the time, although pun
ished badly. â¢ The bout was one of the
most bitterly contested of the night.
Britt did not show to the best advan
tage. His opponent, Harrigan, crouched i
low and kept his gloves in front of his
face. Britt has a dangerous left, which
he ripped in repeatedly on the stomach
to the evident discomfort of his opponent.
In the second round they stood up and
slugged for a spell, Britt having the best
of the little assault at arms. The deci
sion went to Britt. .
W. J. Gooby had F. Ferem nearly scared
to death in their bout- Ferem's seconds
came to his rescue by throwing up the
sponge early in the second round. Gooby
was a slow starter, but once in action he
made amends for any slowness. He fol
lowed Ferem around the ring with glove
poised in air as if prepared to do unutter
able things to him. Once he rushed head
long across the ring and hurled himself
on Fereih. When the round ended ho
strolled leisurely and by a* circuitous
route to his corner. Ferem dazed Gooby
once with a left swing, but was himself
quickly reduced to a state of non-com
batlveness, when his : seconds saved him
by throwing up the sponge to his evident
delight.
George Eager, who bears a striking re
semblance to Champion Jeffries, won rrom
W. H. Hammersley. Eager proved a hard
hitter and clever boxer, although for a
brief moment he was in difficulty from a
hard right. Blood flowed freely, making
both men as red as Indians from their
waists up.
The night's boxing commenced with thi>
feather-weights, and they showed great
sport. Frank . McConnell j Jr. won the
crowd with his cleverness, gameness and
hard hitting.. He won from A. Ramke.

second round, when Scholes peppered his
opponent all over the ring. Macdonald
went to the floor several times to avoid
punishment, but Scholes was always the
gentlemanly boxer and took no. unfair ad
vantage. - - â¢
Early in the third round Macdonald,
whose face was commencing to show the
effects of frequent visitations of Scholes'
gloves, went to the floor. Scholes tried
to lift him to his feet at once, but he
would not permit him to do so, taking a
rest of eight seconds. All the fight had,
apparently, been taken out of the man
from across the bay, and his' seconds
threw up the sponge before the round was
completed. Scholes was cheered as he left
the arena and took a seat by the ring
side, where he could see his next oppo
nent, \V. J. Leonard, in action.
The fighting blood of Leonard was
aroused in his bout with Joe Sullivan and
he heedlessly committed a breach of ring
etiquette, for which he was roundly hissed.
He had Jabbed Sullivan until the latter
showed unmistakable signs of having ex
tracted all the sport there was in the
game for him. Early in the third. round
Sullivan's seconds threw up the -sponge
and Leonard's seconds Jumped into the
ring. But before they could stop him he
rushed at Sullivan, who was badly dis
tressed, and knocked him to the floor. He
apologized for his error, but the specta
tors hissed him from the ring. Leonard
knocked Sullivan down repeatedly during
the bout and the latter usually stayed
down as long as- possible. From appear

familiarity with ring tactics will not
counterbalance this.
Only one bout was fought in the heavy
weight class, J. A. Munroe, the giant foot
ball player, meeting and winning from
Charles Mil ward, who weighed some forty
pounds less than he did. When "Bob"
McGibben. the announcer, said he was a
heavy-weight, a ripple of laughter swept
through the gymnasium, as any one with
half an eye could see he was. The.dis

chance. Munroe hustled him about the
ring and once in his impetuosity he near
ly dashed headlong through the ropes be

was down for six seconds in the first
round and had difficulty in lasting it out.
A left swing flush on the mouth nearly
put him out of business. In the second
round he sustained a badly cut mouth and
went down hard, taking eight seconds on
the floor. There were murmurs among
the spectators that the unequal battle be
