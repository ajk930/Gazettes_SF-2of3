Last December he had an operation per
formed at Fresno by Dr. Davis and since
then he had been In the German Hospital
at San Francisco for relief. Over his con

friends of the family assert that he had
been melancholy for years. .

of the cause of this dreadful affair." said
his father, "than that Alexander was

suicide, none of us took any stock in his

occurred when I heard the pistol shots

Alexander. I thought as the reports

"There Is every Indication," explained
Dr. Kelsey, "that the Insanity of the

smoking. In the room were dozens of
half-smoked cigarettes and his features

that the physical trouble from which he

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 9.
WHILE asleep in bed this morning
Charles Carter, a freshman at
the University of California.
,: was shot and killed by 'his In
sane brother, Alexander Carter, who im-;
mediately afterward committed suicide by
shooting himself in the head. The double
tragedy occurred in the brothers' bed
room at their residence, 2111 Rose street.
North Berkeley, where the family has
lived for six months. The brothers were
sons of George W. T. Carter, formerly an
Assemblyman from Contra Costa County,
and for seven years past a rancher In
Fresno County.
Illness and excessive cigarette. smoking
are the causes which led to Alexander
Carter's insanity. For several- years he
had been suffering from an abdominal
trouble, the result of an accident, and was
low-spirited because of the failure of an
operation to relieve him. His inveterate
use of cigarettes combined to upset his
mind and induced a form of melancholia.
Recently he had told his parents he was
afraid of going insane. They insist, as do
the young man's friends, that Insanity
alone can explain his terrible deeds.
The two brothers occupied a rear
bedroom In the trim cottage which Is
the home of the Carters. In the house
were Mr. and Mrs. Carter and a daughter.
Miss Mary Carter. The father was awak
ened about 6:30 o'clock by two pistol shots.
Miss Carter was also aroused, and they
intuitively realized what was the trouble.
The elder Carter rushed to his sons' room
and found the door locked. His calls fail
ing to elicit a response he attempted to
force the door, but failed. â¢ Then half
dressed Mr. Carter went outside and with
the assistance of neighbors a window to
the room was opened and the aged parent
climbed in. - : . . Â¦â¢. .
A horrible sight met his gaze. In the bed
lay the younger student, the coverings
drenched with -blood, while on, the floor
lay Alexander with a bullet wound in his
head. Blood covered the floor and was
spattered about the room. At the older
brother's side was the pistol with which
he had done such terrible execution.
Wounds Frove Fatal.
Drs. H. N. Rowell and J. E. Kelsey
were callef.but told the horrified relatives
that the wounds of both men were fatal.
Three hours later Charles died, his broth
er living until 1 o'clock this afternoon. As
soon as an examination of the room could
be made It was discovered chat Alexander
had risen and 1 half-dressed himself, evi
dently without disturbing his brother,
who occupied a separate bed. On the floor
at the foot of the fratricide's bed was hla
canvas traveling-bag, open, and its con
tents strewn about.. In the bag, he had
kept i his pistol." an old-fashioned five
chambered weapon, on the model of a
Smith & Wesson.
Alexander had shot his brother evident
ly while the latter was fast asleep, for
he lay under the bedcovers, which were
undisturbed. ; The ; maniac brother - had
stood 'several feet away and had shot di
rectly; at his sleeping brother's head, the
bullet entering a couple of inches back of
the right ear. He, then placed the muzzle
of the pistol in his own mouth and sent a
bullet through his brain.
There was not a particle of evidence In
the room* to indicate that the deed- was
premeditated.' Every appearance was that
the shooting was the result of a suddsu

AFGHANISTAN'S AMEER
STANDS WITH ENGLAND
LONDON, March 9â The Ameer of Afghanistan has auhtorized his agent in
London to publish the following statement of the policy of Afghanistan
toward Great Britain and Russia. After saying that he had devoted much
anxious thought to the possibility of Russia: taking advantage of the
Transvaal war to advance through Afghanistan and India, his Highness
adds:
"I have come to the conclusion that Russia feared Afghanistan, as war with
the Afghans would mean a general rising of all Islam, which would spread
through Russian Asia. Russia had not troops enough to combat such a rising.
Her hold on the Mussulman countries she has conquered is insecure. They hate
her, and with ten times her power Russia could not fight Afghanistan and India
successfully. The Afghans prefer death to slavery, and their women and children
are being taken by the Russians."-
After saying he is willing to send numerous troops to help Great Britain in
the Transvaal, but adding that the Afghans are unaccustomed to the sea, the
Ameer adds: Â¦ <
"But England's troubles are always my troubles; her strength is my strength,
and her weakness Is my weakness. England must remember that I am always
ready to fight for h.er on land here or in India."
of the Boers. All other reports tend to
confirm the state of disorganization of the
Boer forces, Transvaal as well as Free
State. The general Impression Is that the
further progress of the British to Bloem
fontein will not be opposed.
A great amount of ammunition was de
stroyed to-day. This Included several
boxes of explosive bullets, on the out-ide
of which the Boers had marked, "Manu

Lord Roberts having reported that no
more artillery from home is necessary.
This Is the first pause in reinforcements

force until by the time the Transvaal
frontier is " reached he will have 70.003

.-: '.; Â»,. '.' â ! -.- ... ;
WASHINGTON, March 9.â The Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations to-day
agreed to report the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty amending the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty with an amendment granting au
thority for the defense of the canal by
this country when constructed. .... .. -
The committee was practically unani
mous in favor of the amendment. Some
objection was made by Senator Morgan of
Alabama, but he will not oppose the meas
ure In the Senate, accepting, the change
In order to hasten the action of the Sen
ate. Quite an elaborate report has been
prepared by Morgan, which will be sub
mitted to the Senate in executive session
when' the treaty is reported. It is tha
opinion of members of the Senate that
the change will but little delay the ratifi
cation of the treaty as amended.
The amendment is brief. It simply pro
vides that the restrictions in the treaty
shall not operate to prevent the United
States from using its own forces for the
defense of the interests of the United
States and the "maintenance of order.
Senator Morgan was the only member
of the committee who cast his vote
against the amendment, Senators Bacon
and Daniel, the only other Democrats
present, voting with the Republicans.
They also voted with the Republicans to
have the treaty reported as amended.
Morgan's Opposition.
Senator Morgan talked at length dur
ing the sitting of the committee in oppo
sition to the amendment, practically con
suming the entire time of the session. He
contended for the utmost liberality to
ward other powers in the use of the pro
posed canal and held that American in
terests were fully safeguarded by the
treaty as it stands. He also contended
that an effort to amend the agreement
might result in its defeat and Indicated
a purpose to oppose it to the utmost.
Some of the other Senators expressed the
hope that he would not go to this extent,
and before the meeting adjourned there
was felt to be some ground for the opin
ion that the Alabama Senator would con- ]
tent himself with stating his opposition. J
While no member was authorized to j
speak for Great Britain, the opinion was j
expressed that the Government of that
country would agree to the proposed
modification of the treaty.
Adoption Recommended.
The report submitted with the treaty
1b in the main a review of the general
situation with reference to the canal with
comparatively few recommendations. It
says, however, "we are in full accord with
the purpose expressed in article 2 of the
pen/ing convention to adopt as the basis
of neutralization the indicated rules sub
stantially as embodied In the treaty of |
Constantinople for the free navigation of
the Supz maritime canal."
The report then makes an analysis of
the. Suez canal Â¦ treaty, laying special
stress upon article 10, which, the report
say-s, "prescribes limitations of the ut
most importance upon the stipulations."
The committee concludes its recommen
dations by quoting its proposed amend
ment remarking as follows:
"We are clearly of the opinion that if
article 10 did not exist the trua interests
and necessity of the United States require
upon the highest considerations of pru
dence and fight the adoption of the
amendment proposed."
Question of Good Faith.
The committee also concludes:
"The present abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty would not in the least re
instate the rights of Honduras or Guate
mala, as we allege they were in 1850.
Neither do these states ask our inter
vention in their affairs. But we have a
more compulsory reason, one that in
volves our due respect for the history of
our own country, for ceasing to bring Into
further discussion the questions or good
faith on the part of Great Britain in the
execution of the stipulations and the pur
poses of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty."
This reason is found in the ratification
of the treaties of 1860, referring to which
the committee says:
"Congress expressed no dissent to
them or to the President's ', declara
tion 'that the dangerous questions
arising from the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
have been amicably settled.' We cannot
now assert to the contrary, and, for the
purpose of abrogating that treaty, we can
not insist that those questions are not set
tled.
"The conclusion is unavoidable that the
Government of the United States acknowl
edged In 1860 that the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty was an obligatory convention, and
that it had been fully and satisfactorily
executed on the part of Great Britain as
to all questions which up to that time had
been controverted between the two gov
ernments."
Referring to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
the committee says:
It certainly avoided hottile collision between
these two great powere, whatever may have
been Its faults as an entangling alliance or
national humiliation to us or as the cause oC
protracted and heated diplomatic controversy.
Since 1860 the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been
In some way recognized by the Government In
each of the succeeding administrations as a
substituting compact. Strong reasons for its
abrogation have been frequently stated, and
some have always denied Its obligatory force;
but no movement to accomplish that result has
been made either by Congress or the executive.
This treaty Is therefore open and existing as
a binding and unexecuted compact, with the
txprees approval of the United States as to the
question of our control over the canal and our
right to build and fortify, it. It Is executed,
and therefore unrepeatable as to all other ques
tions and matters covered by its provisions.
A question of its abrogation raised at this time
would only relate to the parts of the treaty
that remain to be executed.
The Identical treaties of Great Britain and
the United States with Nicaragua provide for
the protection of the canal and the companies
of construction by the Governments, with the
use of military or civil Instrumentalities, and
they limit the profits of the concessionary cam
panles to IE vvr cent.
In ci-t respects the Governmental super
vision for the protection of the concessionaire*
whether British or â¢ American, â¢is nearly su
preme, and. would soon become absolute in the
dealings of either of these powers with the pro
tection of their citizens or subjects holding con
cessions from Nicaragua. Â¦

CLEVER AS CATS IN
THEIR ROUGH COUNTRY
LONDON. March 9.-A. G. Hales, the
Daily News correspondent, who fell into
the hands of the Boers February 7 and
was released a few days ago at BloÂ«vmfon
tein, telegraphs "some lsside Impressions"
cf the Boers:
"They are clever as cats in their rough
mountain country and nearly as active,
dashing from point to point with marvel
ous rapidity; equally at home on foot or
!n the- saddle, never by any chance expos-
Ing themselves needlessly, but brave
enough when mere courage and Its use
ure necessary.
"They watched our men moving toward
them on the veldt from behind bushes,
rocks and loose earth, often allowing our
scouts to get within a few yards and per
mitting them to ride away unmolested in
order to draw the troops into ambush."
It was into one of these snares that
llalep with eighty Tasmanians rode.
Lamberts, the Boer general, is described
ss "dressed a* a bullock driver, with
patched tweed trousers, a coarse blue cot
ton shirt, a dirty red cotton handkerchief
around his neck and a battered felt hat."
He wore a. pair of boots that were ragged
at the toes, his sleeves were rolled up to
the elbow and he had a short pipe in his
mouth when Hales saw him. But he
eeemed full of dash and energy, and is
paid to be a celebrated hunter. "His men
did not salute him, but-addressed him fa
miliarly.
Hales and the other wounded were cent
into the interior. Whenever their escort
6toppe<j at a farm men and women gave
them milk, fruit, brandy and tobacco
washed their wounds and literally over
whelmed them with kindly attentions
When some of the British prisoners said
they were married and had families the
Boer women would lift their children to
be shaken by the hand.

James R. Sovereign Declares the Mil

WASHINGTON, March 9.-The cross

continued to-day in the Coeur d'Alene in

on Military Affairs. Representative Dick
took the witness over his statements re
garding martial law and the course of the

the federal Government that declared
and enforced martial law.
Mr Sovereign said that a reading of the
official telegrams satisfied him that the

the military telegrams antedated the
oovernors proclamation by one day.
When asked if the military were there for
any other purpose than to maintain peace
arid order, the witness answered that he
believed this was not their purpose, as
their presence tended to terrorize the peo
ple, substituting military dictation for the
usual civil methods. No one ever heard
of martial law before in labor troubles,
Mr. Sovereign declared. As to his approval

REPRESENTATIONS AS
CABLED TO SALISBURY
LONDON. March 10.â The Dally Mall
publishes the following dispatch from
Pretoria, dated Thursday. March 8, via
Lourenzo Marques/ which has been cen
sored by the Boer Government:
"Conversations I have had 'with the
highest state officials show that the Boers
want some arrangement. They say that
if England is waging a war of conquest
they will fight to the finish. Otherwise
they believe that a plain statement of the
Boer intentions will reveal a basis of ne
gotiation, now that England's prestige Is
repaired.
"President Kruper and President Steyn
conferred on Monday at Bloemfontein on
the incorporation of the above representa
tions In a cablegram to Lord Salisbury-
The preservation of the independence of
the two republics is a sine qua non."
PRISONERS BADLY TREATED.
LONDON. March 10.-Mr. Hollawell, In

American Consul, but in vain.
of the canal. One company being installed would
not necessarily exclude any other.
Joint Ownership Dangerous.
The right to a footing In Nicaragua thus ac
quired by Great Britain Is full of peril to this
republic, and could only be disposed of by fur
ther agreÂ«nient,or by war or by uniting the In
terests cf both Governments in the Joint owner
ship and control of the canal. Such an arrange
ment, while It is still desired by some, would
be a fatal mistake that would soon involve the
countries in war. or It. would enlarge and solid
ify the scheme of alliance that Is embodied In
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty Into a practical al
liance, offensive and defensive, in the control
of navigation and the commerce of the world.
It la these latter treaties that present the real
grounl of our present difficulties, fro-u whlcn
the convention of 1900 relieves us.
Coming" to the pending treaty the re
port says:
No other nation except th* United States
could have so great an interest In the exclusive
right to own and control an isthmian canal,
but in this matter, come what may, we are
compelled to assert the superiority of our
right, now for the first time conceded by Great
Britain. It Is wise and Just, therefore, that
the value of this concession to us should be
estimated as a great consideration for anything
we may yield. If we. indeed, yield anything,
in acquiring the exclusive right to control the
canal by a modification of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty.
In the convention of February 6, 1900,' Great
Britain agrees that the restriction as to the
exclusive control of the canal imposed by the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty shall continue to bind
her, while the United States is released from It
This leaves us free to acquire from Costa Rica
and Nicaragua the exclusive control of the
canal for the Government or for our citizens
under the protection of the United States, while
It cuts off Great Britain from any such right.
Referring to the difficulties which have
arisen over the treaty the report says:
"The only objections that have been"
urged by the United States have not re
lated to the treaty as a binding compact,
but to the conduct of Great Britain In
executing its terms and in refusing to
abandon certain islands and coast posses
sions which she. claimed were not held
after the date of the treaty In violation
of its terms."
Exclusive Control.
Â¦ The committee calls attention to the fact
that under existing conditions the control
of the canal is not "exclusive," and adds:
"This magic word has paralyzed the
eager desire of the two great powers to
control this canal for fifty years, and now
Its disappearance leaves us free to con
struct and control the canal, excluding
any right of Great Britain to interfere."
Touching upon, the strategic importance
of the canal the report says:
We stipulate against the blockade of the
canal by any nation. Â¦ . Â¦-â¢
In conditions that may not be entirely re
mote we would find j this provision, in letting
our ships through the canal free from capture
by onr enemy, of great security to our coast
wise trade. â¢ t ...
With our naval bases at Manila. Honolulu.
San Francisco and San Diego on one side, and
at San Juan, Porto Rico, the Isle of Pines and
Key West, with other fortitled naval stations,
on the other side. It is extremely Improbable
that a fleet would cross either of the arreat
oceans and approach the canal to find a gate
way to the coasts of the other ocean. .
If we are not able to handle an Â«n*my un
der such disadvantages to them our poww of
resistance to such a campaign would be tin
worthy of our country, if it would not b* lu
dicrous. Â¦ .-!-..
Easy to Defend. / Â¦. J 'Â¦'.;Â¦ " 'Â¦.
A*s to the prohibition of the fortifications
the report says:
With the military police by the United States
provided for In this convention for the protec
tion of the canal. Its defense can be made per
fect against any foreign power that is not
strong enough to occupy the country and hold
It against all comers. Â¦ â¢. - Â¦ .
In any event. If war is to com* that will in
volve the ownership or control of the canal or
the right of passage through it,' .no battl*
should be fought In the region near to It. i To
make the canal a battleground 1b necessarily to
expose it to destruction, and the erection of
fortresses for Its protection will Invite hostili
ties to IU locality. â¢ â¢ â¢
But the real danger to th*. canal, from the
absence of fortifications. Is so slight and Im
probable that Its discussion appears to be un
necessary. It is scarcely conceivable that Great
Britain will send a fleet across the Atlantic to
attack our western coasts, or across the Pacific
to attack our eastern coasts. . â¢ â¢ â¢
In the event of such wars 'th* neutrality et
the canal, secured by the consensus of all na
tions, would operate to our advantage by bring
ing our ships of. war safely from ocean to ocean
Into quick access to our harbor defenses -
But the canal is not dedicated to war, but
to peace: and whatever shall better secure Just
and honorable peace is a triumph. â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦-
Senator Morgan later In the day filed a
minority report opposing thÂ© amendment
of the committee.
After announcing his concurrence in the
main report referring to the history of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, Senator Morgan
proceeded to the consideration of that
treaty, as affected by the pending agree
ment. He said that the "extreme conten
tion of the Government of the United
States has been that the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty is violable at our option. Not hav
ing exercised :that option, the treaty 1%
confessedly conclusive as. to the parts of
the agreement that have been executed
and is operative as to the parts that re
main in force. - - . . Â¦â¢â¢
"The only legal' effect. from the amend
ment, if it can have any effect upon our
national' rights or powers,", he says "is
to annul the neutralization of the canal
provided for In article two of the treaty
under consideration. If this ia Its purport
It would be more satisfactory to strike out
that article and declare the abrogation of
the unexecuted parts of the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty." - :Â¦..:.

SYMPATHY OF
SENATORS FOR
THE BOERS
Mason's Resolution Causes a
Discussion in Secret
Session.
MEDIATION IS SUGGESTED
Subject of an Alleged Secret Alli
ance "With Great Britain Sobs
Up, but No Definite Action
Is Taken.
WASHINGTON. March 9.â Discussion
of Mason's resolution, expressing sympa
thy for the Boers, was conducted in the
Senate to-day behind closed doors, Da
vis, cnaircnao of the Foreign Relations
Committee, demanding that the doors be
closed.
Jn the secret session the discussion was
mainly upon the question as to whether
discussion of the Mason motion should be
in open or secret session.
Senator Hoar said he was in favor of
passing a resolution asking the President
to offer his good offices in an attempt at
mediation, and if the Mason resolution of
sympathy should be passed it would pre
vent the passage of such a resolution and
6top the President from making the ten
der on his own account.
TiUman then offered a substitute for
the Mason resolution, requesting the Pres
ident to tender his friendly offices for
mediation. The resolution was as fol
lows:
"That the President be requested to
offer the mediation and kindly offices of
the United States Government to put an
end to the war In South Africa and se
cure peace between Gieat Britain and
the Dutch republics on terms honorable
to both parties to the conflict."
Lodg-e made the point of order that a
cub-resolution could not be offered to the
resolution now la committee, and the
point was sustained.
Hale made a speech In favor of the
Boere similar to the one he delivered in
open session some time ago. 'He added
that he was in favor of the Mason resolu
tion, but that it was useless to try to
pot an expression of sympathy from the
Senate.
The eubject of an alleged secret alliance
came up. Mason said we were told every
day that there Is no secret alliance. If
th*>re If not. said he, let us carry out our
usual habit In men cases. "We always
have passed resolutions of sympathy with
struggling republics," continued Mason,
"and we should do so now."
There was nothing: against Great Britain
in the resolution.
Spooner responded that England had
freen our friend in thÂ© Spanish war, and
we should do nothing' to interrupt these
friendiv relation*.
This brought Hoar to his feet. He said
that a irrÂ»-at question of right and wrong
Â¦was Involved, and it should be settled, re
gardless of questions of friendship,
whether it waa of Spain, England or the
Czar o.f Russia,
Df-pew said he had recently been waited
upon by a committee of Finlanders, who
wantfd the United States to take action
upon the outrages perpetrated upon them
t>y the Czar. He asked why It was that
when the Junidr Senator from Illinois was
tiubhling over with sympathy, some of it
had rot swashed over on the Finladers.
Mason responded that he Btill had a
number of other resolutions on tap which
he would Introduce, but Just at present
he was anxious to have action for ths
Bciere. who most needed It.
It is understood that the motion will bÂ«
debated again next week.

RABBI LEVY'S
SON ATTACKED
By THE PLAGUE
Young Man Is Among the
Victims in Hono
lulu.
Hawaiian Board of Health Presents
an Encouraging Beport Con- .
'. - â¢ cerning the Scourge in
' the Islands.
Â»
HONOLULU, March B.â Four cases of
bubonic plague have developed since
March 2. Among the victims Is Herman
Levy, day clerk at the Hawaiian Hotel.
In this case, as in others where white per
sons are concerned, there Is no clew as to
how the disease was contracted. The case
of Levy is of a pneumonic' type frequently
encountered of late.
Mr. Levy is a son of Rabbi Levy of Ban
Francisco, and has been here about three
years. He was visited by his father and
sister last summer.
The schooner Alice Klmball. from Maul,
brings word that there is a suspicious case
of sickness In camp 2, Kihei plantation.
Captain Nicholson of the schooner re
ported to Dr. Wood that four physicians
had examined the case. Two regarded It
as suspicious, while the other two were
of the opinion that it was not the plague.
Who the physicians were was not stated.
However, the house in which the patient
was found was burned.
Encouraging reports come from the out
side islands. No additional cases of plague
have developed In either Hilo or Kahului.
The Board of Health has decided to lift
the quarantine on both places. With re
spect to the former it was voted that if
there are no other cases of plague befors
next Tuesday the town and port of Kilo
will be declared clean and open to com
merce. The same resolution obtained with
regard to Kahului. save that the date In
this case was made March "IS, or thirty
days from the last case in the detention
camp there. â
The present quarantine rules stop almost
entirely the shipping of most kinds of
freight. The Board of Health desires to
remove this restriction as far as it is safe
to do so. It is thought that arrangements
will be made by which everything but
Oriental goods may bÂ« shipped from here
to the other Islands.
'Japanese merchants and merchants
dealing in Japanese goods are considera
bly wrought up over the action of the
Board of Health In relation to the lm-'
portation of Japanese food stuffs. There
is a movement on foot to memorialize
the President not to place the prohibition
on Importations that has been asked for
by the Board of Health, at least without
further Inquiry Into the matter. The Im
porters say that most of the Japanese ar
ticles In this list, and particularly mlzo,
are articles of everyday diet among the
Japanese, as much as meat or butter is
among the Americans or Europeans.
The Japanese Consul has written
to the Government here protesting
against the action of the Board of Health.
Minister Dayman has evolved a plan
to guard against any delay In the proper
appropriation of funds to carry on the
expense* of the Government. The idea
anticipates a failure of Congress to pass
the enabling act or a failure of the Leg
islature to meet In time to avert the
stringency. Before the Cabinet this
morning he made the following self-ex
planatory statement, which met with ap
proval :
I hava prepared a rough outline or ?stlmaj
of requirements so far as my department goes
and requast estimates from the other depart
ments for a special appropriation bill, to bÂ«
paased by the Council of State and sent . to
President McKlnley for his approval, for money
that will be needed In excess of the present ap
propriation bill, or for such special objects as
may be absolutely necessary to bÂ« called for
(luring the present period before Congress shall
have passed our act or our own I>*sr>!atur-Â»
could act under the circumstances. Whether
the bill receives the approval of President Mc-
Klnley or not. I think we should put ourselves
on record aa to having; tried to do something
to relieve the situation.
The twelve sailors of the British ihip
Inverness-shire were ail found guilty of
neglect of duty by the marine court which
met at the British Consulate. In effect
It was an imposition of fines upon all the
men. amounting to nearly all that la due
them from the vessel, an average of about
$200 each. The wages that are due them
will be applied to reimburse the ship for
the loss occasioned by reason of their
conduct. This is the losing of an an
chor and over a hundred fathoms of chain,
and about a month's time. The Inver
ness-shlre is out at least $2000.
The old British bark Sebastian Bach
will probably end her ocean career in Hon
olulu. She Is anchored outside, having
called here In distress, andls in such con
dition that seamen do not think It worth
while to repair her. The bark 13 a very
old one and Is all wood. Captain "Wooley
has written to the owners for Instruction*.
The Sebastian Bach Is owned In Hong
kong, and was on her way from there to
the coast with ballast when she encoun
tered a storm that almost sent her to the
bottom.' Her seams opened, some plates
came off, the bulwarks were smashed in
and she sprung a leak. The captain
steered for Honolulu to get repairs, and
has been anchored outside the harbor for
about a week.

MARCONI PLAN
FOR REPORTING
STEAMSHIPS
Agents of Trans-Atlantic
Lines Urge Its Ap
,. .. . '
plication.
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEW YORK. March 9.â Since the an
nouncement in The Call and the Herald
of the successful operation of the Marconi
system of wireless telegraphy between
the North German Lloyd liner Kaiser WII
helm der Grosse and a station on-Borkum
Island, on the north coast of Germany,
the Interests j of local agents of trans-
Atlantic lines and of shipping men in gen
eral has been attracted anew to the ap
plication of a system between Nantucket
and Nantucket South Shoal lightship.
The need of telegraphic communication
between these points fdr reporting steam
ships hours before they are due at their
piers has long been the subject of Inquiry
and discussion. The lightship Is about
thirty-five miles from Nantucket. and the
stretching of a cable between the points
has baffled mechanical and electrical engi
neering skill for years. The difficulties of
communication, it is now generally recog
nized, can be surmounted by wireless tel-
Inward-bound steamships pass within
signaling distance of the lightship, and If
there were communication to Nantucket
news of the sighting of a fast liner could
be flashed to this city from twelve to fif
teen hours before she could reach her
pier.
The first reporting station Is now on
Fire Island, four hours' run to port, and
to be reported at this station liners have
to make a detour from the track of travel
to the north. The advantages of an early
report of incoming steamers are of incal
culable value.
Emll L. Boas, general manager of the
Hamburg-American line here, was ap
pointed at a conference of trans-Atlantic
interests several months ago to urge upon
the Lighthouse Board the establishment
of a station on Nantucket lightship. The
success of the Marconi system at that
time led to the suggestion for its use at
the station in a letter from Mr. Boas to
Rear Admiral Higginson. chairman of the
Lightship Board. In which he cited the
varied advantages of such a system.
In reply Rear Admiral Higginson stated
that he had already taken up the subject,
having recognized its great importance,
and was not only ready but anxious to
put the Nantucket lightship at the dis
position of one competent to conduct the
svstera. Since that timeâ last Juneâ the
matte- has been In abeyance. One cause
of delay Js said to be the question of the
.validity of the patent rights of wireless
telegraphy., -'
ton Riggs. noted as a football player, had
committed suicide In a lonely camp In the
heart of Mexico.
The news was sent to his father, H. B.
Rlggs a well-known clubman. In a letter
from D. F. Buckingham, who was Rlgg3'
tentmate.
Stanley Riggs went to Mexico as a civil
engineer two years ago with a party com
posed of Tale and Princeton graduates. '
PREPARATIONS TO OPEN
THE PARIS EXPOSITION
Engineers and Directors Insist That
Everything Will Be Beady for
the Inaugural by April 14.
Special Cable to The Call and tha New Tork
Herald. Copyright, 1900, by thÂ» New York
Herald Company.
PARIS, March 9.â Everything .indicates
that the opening of the exposition will
not be long delayed. Engineers and di
rectors Insist that everything will be in
complete preparation on the evening of
April 14 and ready for the entry of the
public by next day. The last vestige of
the portico of the Palace de l'lndustrie
disappeared this week and the magnifi
cent avenue from the Champs Elysees to
the Invalides is being rapidly cleared.
Already it offers a beautiful perspective.
Between the two fine palaces are pylons,
surmounted by gilded statues, from each
end of Alexander bridge to the buildings
on the Esplanade dcs Invalides devoted
to French national industries, and tho
view is closed in the distance by the great
dome over Napoleon's tomb.
The foreign buildings along the Seine
toward the Champ de Mars are in very
different stages of completeness. That of
the United States could ba opened to
morrow. Next to it is that of Turkey,
the least advanced of all.
The Prefect of Police first wanted 1600
additional policemen for the whole year,
but the Municipal Council refused to
grant more than 1200 for the period of the
exhibition. A ftreboat with steam up will
be kept moored along the quay at the end
of the Champ de Mars during the entire
period of tht> exposition ready to go to
any point.
One of the most picturesque parts of the
exposition will be in the Trocadero Gar
dens, where colonial pavilions are erected,
liere will be gathered natives from all
parts of the worldâ savages from Da
homey, some of Queen Ranavalona's late
subjects, Siamese, Japanese, Chinese,
Ainfos, Tunisiansâ in fact a bizarre col
lection of aboriginal races.

the order for the execution was given,
but before it could be accomplished the
Spanish lieutenant suddenly appeared
from a gap in the jungle and bade his
men lay down their guns.
"It was only a bluff." Bald the sailor sol
diers yesterday, "but It left some lines In
our memories that never will be effaced."
Insulted and Abused.
From the point of attack the captives
were marched to San Ysidro, then the
capital of Agulnaldo. where they were all
thrown Into the common Jail and sub^
Jected to infamous treatment during nine
days. Aguinaldo was there at the time,
but he was preoccupied with other things
âthe war against this country. General
Tinlo, a truculent, brutal native chief,
was made their master. From him noth
ing but insults and indignities could be
obtained.
The next place reached was Vigan, and
one 'month was consumed in the journey
from Ysidro to this village. Along th* line
of march the treatment accorded by the
natives to the Americans was of the va
ried order. Insult would follow hard upon
a welcome, but the cruel Tinio stood over
them all the time.
Abandoned to Fate.
Led out from Vigan in the mountain
fastnesses and in the thickest of
Jungles, the party,' which numbered about
twenty at this time, having been rein
forced by other prisoners, American and
English, gathered together in Vigan, was
abandoned. The captives pleaded for
rifles, for ammunition and for food, but
they were refused in every instance. For
two days they traveled, their clothing
torn from their backs and their frames
racked with poignant hunger. The entire
distance covered was three miles, and the
end of their land Journey was bounded by
a river unknown to the whites. Here,
where despair was the keenest, the be
draggled band of captives was rescued by
Colonel Hare with 140 men and officers
from the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth
Infantry.
Rescued by Colonel Hale.
When found the party was in the act of
building rafts to use on the river and
were at the point of being molested by
the natives, who withdrew at the sight
of the approaching army.
"I cannot say enough of the rescuing
army," said Lieutenant Gillmore. "Colonel
Hale meant what he said when he gave
utterance to the words. Til follow Gill
more If I follow him to hell.' The men
who saved us were exhausted when we
met them. They were without clothes,
without food and crippled from their ar
duous march. The provisions which gave
out forced us to live on the country." In
all we constructed thirty-five rafts, and
our experience In this water ' chute was
terrific. The river ran ten miles an hour
in some places and the shooting of the
rapids was the most dangerous of all our
trip. .
"Three times my raft was overturned
and once I was rescued from a watery
grave. We lost arms and ammunition In
this Journey, but it was finally over when
we reached Arbaloque. From this place
we went down the coast to Manila,"
And, puffing away at a cigar, with a
restful, satisfied manner, Lieutenant GUl
more confessed, unasked, that his present
condition was more enjoyable and com
fort-giving.
"Why, I lost fifty pounds on that trip,"
was his concluding remark.
He will go to Washington in a few days
to report to the Secretary of the Navy.
WAS RESCUED
WHEN IN THE
LAST STRAITS
Lieutenant Gillmore Arrives
on the Solace and Tells
His Adventures.
SENTENCED TO BE EXECUTED
Story of the Capture, Escape and In
tense Physical Suffering Ex
perienced by the'York
town Officer.
When the Solace, the United States
navy transport, steamed through the
Golden Gate yesterday morning there
was a group of officers standing on
the for'ard deck, craning for a view
of San Francisco on the hills. In the
group was Lieutenant J. C. Gillmore, a
hero of the insurrection in the Philip
pines, the man whose name has appeared
In every newspaper in thli country as the
central figure of a tale of adventure that
is without parallel In the history of the
late war. His is the story of a capture
by fierce natives and an escape that con
tains all the elements of romantic ad-
venture with grim-vlsaged war as its
background.
Lieutenant Gillmore Is a young men, full
of the spirit of the adventurous soldier,
yet he tells his story with a becoming
modesty and reserve, disclaiming all pre
tensions to the heroic. The hairbreadth
escapes by flood and breach, the untold
suffering and mental torture through
which he passed are narrated in a plain,
unvarnished way. His manner is that of
the man of arms making his report. Sit
ting in an easy chair In the wardroom
of the Solace, Lieutenant Gillmore spoke
of his hardships, of a six months' cap
tivity, with death by starvation staring
him in the face, of indignities forced upon
him by a weak but barbaric people, of
the many dangers that beset him and his
final rescue when hope was at the lowest
tide.
Attacked and Captured.
"There were fourteen of us in all that
left the Yorktown on the east coast of
Luzon," be said, "on a reconnoissance up
the Baler river. In the province of Prin
cipe. We manned a cutter and worked
our way up the river far out of reach of
the ship. Without any foreknowledge of
an enemy we were surprised and taken
prisoners after showing all the resistance
possible under the circumstances.."
Of the party of fourteen who were with
Lieutenant Gillmore on the expedition
there are two members who returned on
the Solace. They are Paul Vaudolt, a
mate, and William Walton, chief quar
termaster. Both these men have 6een
service at sea for many years, and are
packed to the eyes with memories of
their seven months* captivity. They also
tell a story of deep Interest and color
Identical in dates and incident.
The attacking party numbered some sev
enty men, fifty on one side of the river
and twenty on the other, under thÂ© com
mand of a lieutenant, wh* was a Spanish
renegade. Whan Lieutenant Gillmore saw
that prolonged resistance would be futile
he surrendered, and under the guard of
the Spanish officer hÂ« and his men, or
what was left of them, were removed to
a tent some little distance from the river.
In the struggle four men were killed and
three severely wounded. Lieutenant Gill
more received a slight wound in the
knee, which gave him little inconvenience
and pain. The Americans were thus re
duced to one-half their original number.
Sentenced to Death.
A day and a half they remained in the
camp of the enemy, waiting with most
'fearful anxiety for the sentence of their
captors. It came at last. Bound hand
and foot, the seven Americans were lined
up on the bank of the river and they were
then told that sentence had been passed
upon them. They were to be shot to
death. Then followed another half-hour
I of strained waiting, at the end of whlca

NEW HAVEN, March 9.-Hon. E. J.
Phelps, former Minister to England, died
at his home In this city late this after
noon, after an Illness of two months. The
end was peaceful and for several hours

side the wife and son, Charles Phelps of
Boston, and the daughter. Mrs. Horatio
Loomia of New York, and his physician.
Though , Professor Phelps recovered
from the attack of phneumonla he was so
weakened that he was unable to regain

But Three Rounds Needed
I in Which to Do the
NEW YORK, March 9.â Terry McGov
ern of Brooklyn knocked out Oscar Gardv
ncr, the "Omaha Kid," in the third round
of what was to have been a twenty-five
round bout before the Broadway Athletic
Club to-night. McGoveni was a favorite
in the betting at long odds. Johnny White
was referee. Gardner did some good work
in the first round, succeeding in knocking
McGovern down with a left swing on the.
Jaw. McGovern rushed matters from the
opening of the second round until the end
of the fight. His attack was cyclonic, and
with a well-directed left he put Gardner
to the floor. Gardner's defense proved to
be of no use against the torrent of ftetlc
abuse that McGovern rained upon hkn.
Three times Gardner went down and each
time he almost took the "count." In the
third round McGovern rushed like a bull
dog at his adversary and threw a left
hook to the Jaw, which staggered the
Western man toward the ropes. Then
Terry sent a right to the face, which sent
Gardner staggering in the opposite direc
tion, and seeing that Oscar waa unable to
defend himself the little champion stepped
in and landed a left swinging hook on the
mark, which put Gardner down'and out.
McGovern was a 3 to 1 favorite early li.
the evening. The Gardner people held
back for bigger odds and then took even
money that the Kid would last ten rounds.
"Al" Smith bet $1000 against $300 that
McGovern Xvould win. A well known Wall
street broker bet $200 against $2000 that
Gardner would last the limit of twenty
five rounds.
When the preliminary bout was put on
there was not a vacant seat in the house
and the aisles were crowded.
The contestants in the opening bout
were Dannie Dougherty of Philadelphia
and Al Levy of this city. They met at
105 pounds for a twelve-round go. At the
end of the twelfth round Referee Johnny
White declared Dougherty the winner.

Â¦ Â» ROM the performances of the East
| i em wrestlers in'the- Olympic Club
M tournament last night It is but faint
I praise to say they are in a class by
'â¢*- themselves. It was a liberal .educa-
tlon in the art and pastime of wrest-"
ling to watch their movements on . the
mat. They may have no greater teper
toire of holds than the Callfornlans, but
they go to work quickly and keep contin
ually going during each bout. Max Wiley
of. Rochester played another star engage
ment last night. He was drawn against
O. W. Davis, and weighed 135 pounds to
his opponent s 145. The bout lasted Just
thirty seconds, during which time both
men were aggressive. Davis fairly threw
himself. He tried a head spin to get out
of danger, and Instead spun on his shoul
ders and lost.
In the 125-pound class August Kurzman,
St. George Athletic Club, 125 pounds, met
William Nelson, 105 pounds, of the same
club.' Nelson was the aggressor, his op
ponent apparently not trying to win from
him decisively. The bout was an inter
esting one, as the sinewy wrestlers
showed In quick succession a great vari
ety of holda. Kurzman scored one fall
between the ropes, which, under the rules,
could not be allowed. After being in ac
tion Â«ix minutes Referee Eugene Van
Court ordered an additional bout of three
minutes on the ground that although Nel
son had been the aggressor, Kurzman
had been three times in jeopardy but had
saved himself. Kurzman was the aggres
sor this time, and his superior weight
and strength -were apparent. He scored
quickly a flying fall with a | high back
hold. :
â¢ Joseph F. Renzland, the last of the quar
tet of Eastern stars, won handily from J.
A. -McKenzle, Olympic Club. There was
a lot of. tugging and hauling before the
athletes went to the mat, but once there
the practiced Easterner soon ended -the
trouble with .a half-Nelson and crotch
hold. ; V . '
The special match " between William
Hoethlg and' Da- Mahoney -was slow
after the previous .brilliant work. They
hod strength ' but no science, and when
they secured a hold did not appeaf to
know to what use It Fhould be put. Ma
honey won two straight falls.
Of. the three boxing bouts the sponge
was thrown up In two and the third re
sulted In a knockout. Wegener and Miilet
fought to determine which should have
the honor of being well thrashed to-night
by Rodenbach, the Eastern wonder, In the
middle-weight class. Millet is the .Indian.
This may be Rodenbach's last appearance
as an amateur, as he has many tempting
offers from the East to enter the profes
sional arena. . .
Wepener. and Millet do not show to ad
vantage In the ring. "Wepener has a sleepy
way about him, -while Millet, though will-
Ing, 1b not clever. Wegener surprised the
spectators and his opponent by scoring a

AROUNDTHE BOATHOUSES
The directors of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union will hold
their March meeting next Friday, and the
regatta committee will meet at an early
day and discuss the prospects of the com
ing season. President J. li. Bockman is
strongly in favor of adopting Oakland
Creek for regattas, as the water is smooth
and the facilities for reaching the course
are good.
There is plenty of activity at the Ala
meda Boat Club house on Sundays. The
junior barge crew is going out for prac
tice each week and is expected to do well
In the first open regatta of lÂ»)0. There are
also three junior outrigged skiff menâ J.
Timmons, E. Hainan and C. Hagueâ who
will give a good account of themselves.
The Dolphin Boating Club's Junior barge
crew for the season Is composed of T.
Dixon, E. Kragness, H. A. Swedlund and
II O'Hea, while the senior four are Alex
\Y Pape, George Baker, W. O. Patch and
Dr F. R. Axton or E. Kragness. Pape
thinks he has gained a high enough repu
tation as a sculler in thfe outrigged skiff
and will row in the shell this year.
George Baker is practicing in the skiff
and will try hard to become the champion.
As Dr. C. C. Dennis is reported to intend
to enter few competitions this year and
Pape is going to take up shell rowing the
way seems clear for Baker.
The South End Rowing Club has not
devoted much attention >to rowing mat
ters this year, but its senior barge crew
will get to work soon and will endeavor
to defeat the redoubtable Alameda "Spid
ers " The crew Is made up of Tom Lynch
(bow). Gus Carson (No. 2), T. Lynch (No.
3) and George Bates (stroke). r
The junior barge crew of the Ariel Row-
Ing Club has been regularly organized and
a second Junior four will be made up. The
intermediate barge crew has also been
going out for practice. On McKenna's
return to the city the senior barge crew
will be got together. B. Brown. J. Smith
and M. Morris of Australia were recently
elected members. t
At the regular. monthly meeting of the
Triton Swimming and Boating -Club it
was decided to move the clubhouse from
its present situation to the foot of Larkln
street where there Is ready access to deep
water. Some of the Tritons would like to
see a race between George Baker of the
Dolphins and Stanley Adderley, who won
the junior outrigged skiff championship
last year at the regatta at El Campo.
NHAS NO COMPETITOR.
One Patent Medicine Which Has tha
Field to Itself.
A prominent physician was recently
asked why it was there are so many,
"blood purifiers," "nerve tonics" and
medicines for every ill except one of tha
most common and annoying diseases, viz.,
piles.
He replied there are two principal rea-
sons: First, physicians and people in gen-
eral have thought for years that the only
permanent cure, for piles was a surgical
operation, and that medicinal preparations
were simply pollatlves and not a cure for
the trouble.
Another reason is that plies, unllka
many other diseases, is in no sense an im-
aginary trouble. A sufferer from piles la
very much aware of the fact and for this
reason the few pile salves and ointments,
etc.. have been short lived because the pa-
tient very soon discovered their worthless-
ness.'
He continues: However, there is a new-
pile remedy which, judging from its pop-
ularity and extent of its sale, will soon
take the place of all other treatment for
piles. It has certainly made thousands
of cures In this obstinate disease, and its
merit, repeatedly tested, h*as made it fa-
mous among physicians and wherever in-
troduced. The remedy is sold by drug-
gists everywhere under the name of Pyra-
mid Pile Cure.
It Is in convenient, suppository form,
composed of harmless astringents and
beating oils, gives immediate relief in all
forms of piles and a radical cure without
resort to the knife and without pain or
interference with dally occupation.
One strong recommendation for the rem-
edy is that it contains no cocaine nor
opium and is absolutely safe to use at any
time.
One of the suppositories is applied at
night, is absorbed and the euro is natural
and painless.
It permanently cures itching, bleeding
or protruding 1 piles and is the only remedy
except a dangerous surgical operation
that will do so.
All druggists sell a complete treatment
of the suppositories for 50. cents, and tha
Pyramid Drug Co. Â«f Marshall. Mich., will
mall free to any address a little book or*
cause and cure of plies, which may be of
assistance in chronic cases.
It is supposed that the average depth
of sand in the deserts of Africa is from
thirty to forty feet.

COMPETITION
FOR PATH AND
FIELD HONORS
University Athletic Team Will
Be Chosen Shortly at a
Public Meet.
BERKELEY, March 9.â Again has the
freshman-sophomore field day been post-
poned-because of the rain. As four field
days will have to be run off in three Sat
urdays, there will be some doubling. On
Saturday, the 17th inst., the freshman
sophomore and Affiliated Colleges will
come together for the championship.
Those days will be gala days for ath
letes, as baseball games will be played on
tne same afternoon. For two weeks the
successful men in the triple meet will
have an opportunity to get in condition
for the university champlcfnshlp. On
March 24 the cinder path will be turned
over to the Academic League. With the
exception of an .ODen 220-yard dash, the
events will be entirely for high schools
and preparatory academies. March 31, if
the-weather is propitious, ought to have
a prominent place in the annals of ath
letics at the State University.
Then the most likely candidates for the
team which is to go East will come to
gether. Already the records of a half
dozen men give them first call on the
team. There are new men and men who,
although they have never run here, have
reputations for other colleges, who may
surprise even the most conservative.
Events like the 220 and 440 yard dashes,
with Drum and Cadogan and maybe a
dark horse or two, will be worth going
miles to see. The distance runs promise
to.bring out the keenest rivalry, "as the
men are about on a par in their records.
Â¦ Manager.Decoto, upon whom the burden
of the trip East rests,, has sent East for
two vaulting poles and for a new patent
ed hammer. These Eastern apparatuses
are said to be vastly superior to tho3e
used here. As the men are to be given
every nsslstance and advantage possible,
new materials are being sought continu
ally. . , . Â¦ Â¦
Fora week the baseball team has
not been together on account of the
slushy diamond. . As the batting and field
ing of-the team "was good, the rest may
prove of great benefit to the men. The
batting record of this year's team Is, far
ahead of that of last year. .
Saturday the big team will; play the
Santa Clara College team on the campus
at 3:30 o'clock. The line-up will.be as fol

TRAINING AT STANFORD.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 9.â
Stanford's corps .of : athletes ' have 'been
confined mostly to indoor work during the
past week. The track men were placed in
the gymnasium, where they wers given
enough exercise to keep them in condition,
as the excellent results, of the handicap
field day held yesterday shows. : On a
track soggy from", the rains of the past
week the sprinters were able, to make rec
ords only the fraction ot a second slower
than those oorf r the . last intercollegiate
meet.- â¢â¢ Nourse, Stewart and, McCaughern
gave the- most -promise in -the sprints,
while ' Chadbourne, Baker; â¢ Smith , and Ni
klrk were ;the leaders in the distances. In
the broad jump Symonds and Lyons both
did better, than twenty feet. The field
events had to be postponed until the
ground dries.
Coach Murphy takes no pains to conceal
his disappointment with the work of the
baseball men. In a public interview he
scored them for not keeping training rules
and an inexcusable ignorance of the game.
The interest of the week has been cen
tered upon the selection of next year 3
football coach. The opinion as to the wis
dom of Manager Gildersleeve's appointment
of Yost of Lafayette College seems to be
evenly divided. The manager claims that
his choice ia the best that could be mado
from the material in the Held, while Cap
tain Burnett is not satisfied that such is
the case. The latter mentions such men
as McÃride of Yale, Forbes and Rogers of
Harvard. Outland and OverfleUl of Perm
sylvanla. "Pop" Warner and Starbuck of
Cornell and others who are equally well
known who could be secured. With him
are most of the football men and all the
graduate coaches, with one exception. The
objection to Yost is that he does not know
the game as it is played by the big East
ern teams, and that he is practically un
known to the men of football rank. The
matter is before the Associated Students,
where it is expected the differences will be
adjusted without further trouble.

THE SMALLEST STERN WHEELERS AFLOAT.
THE Pulton Engineering and Ship-building Works has Juat completed two of
the greatest curios in marine architecture ever seen on the bay of San
Francisco. They are stern-wheel launches, each of which is thirty-five feet
long, with a twelve-foot beam and only twenty-four Inches depth of hold.
Loaded they only draw six inches of water, and under trial have made seven
knots an hour. The little river boats are perfect in every detail and would de
light the heart of a curiosity hunter. The engines are marvels of lightness, com
pactness and strength. A longshoreman could easily pick up one of the ma
chines and carry it away.' 7
The two boats are intended for the Amoor River (Siberia) trade. They have
been built to the order of a Russian firm and will go from here to Vladivostok
on the tramp steamer Leander.
LAWLESSNESS ON THE RANGES.
AS if to emphasize the position of the Secretary
of Agriculture and the proceedings of the
Pacific Stockmen's Association in this city,
comes news of the renewal of violence and bloodshed
on the common ranges of Arizona. The same system
has been followed there that has destroyed the forage
of all the arid West. As an overstocking of cattle
has reduced the crop of natural forage, sheep have
followed to obliterate what remains. Twelve years
ago the situation was acute in that Territory. Vast
flocks of sheep were driven from one part of the
country to another, leaving the ground stripped and
dusty behind them. On the pastures of the Tonto
basin they found great herds of cattle and destroyed
the pasture upon which they were feeding. In the
feud which resulted between the cattle and sheep
men forty lives were. lost.
Since then there has been no restoration of good
feeling, and the cattle interest has every year become
more enfeebled by the impoverishment of the ranges.
The whole community has been compelled to take an
interest in the issue.. It has been discovered that
when the soil is stripped of its vegetable covering and
the roots are killed sheep tramp it into dust. The
rain falls without penetrating the ground and turns
this surface dust into a sort of cement, which glazes
the surface and holds the water for evaporation or
compels its speedy drainage into streams that be
come torrents, and the water is wasted. The people
are now startled to discover that in twelve years the
average annual run-off of the streams has decreased
one-third, with the same annual average rainfall as
before. Hundreds of springs are going dry through
the dehydration of the earth's crust, and the whole
Territory is likely to suffer in consequence. In view
of these facts it is not to be wondered at that the wa:
of the Touto basin is about to be renewed. The Secre
tary of the Interior has granted permission to drive
sheep upon the Black mesa, which is part of a forest
reservation, and the shepherds have mobilized their
flocks and started to feed them across the Tonto basin
again. The general increase in aridity from the cause
stated has greatly reduced the forage of that basin,
and there is hardly enough to carry the cattle
through. The cattlemen have turned the sheep back,
and each side is gathering an armed force to fight it
out. This is no novel situation. In some degree it
is chronic throughout the arid belt, and common
over the whole grazing domain of the West. There
is no law for the range except force. It is commons.
One man has as much, and as little, legal right to
its use as another. Cattlemen and sheepmen want
the forage crop of the present season, and in one
form or another they fight for it.
While this war goes on its cause increases by rea
son of the rapid deterioration of the pasture. Vast
tracts have already been fed back to desert and will
support neither sheep nor cattle. These exposed and
btear surfaces add to heat and evaporation, injuriously
affecting the whole region by increasing its aridity.
Agriculture, present and future, is smitten vitally by
these conditions, and an indifferent public looks on
at the destruction of life and property as if there
were no remedy.
The Secretary of Agriculture has suggested the sole
remedy. It does justice to cattle, horse and sheep
rangers alike, and protects the mineral prospector
and the agricultural settler. This remedy is leasing
these grazing lands, and compelling each lessee to
keep his cattle, horses or sheep on his own lease
hold, to avoid overstocking it, and to renew as rap
idly as possible the natural grasses, white sage and
other forage plants which clothed it in its primitive
condition.
We can conjure no objections to this sane and law
ful and orderly policy. It will end strife and murder.
It will increase the moisture of the arid region by
covering the ground again with vegetable growth.
It will restore the annual lun-off of the watercourses
and make dry springs again affluent. Its revenues
will go to the States and Territories to he spent in
irrigation works to increase the breadth of their sown
lands and add to their taxable valuation.
It is indeed pitiful that men should look with in
difference upon existing disorder and murder and
less on the ranges, when a remedy for it all, so en
lightened and in line with prudent government, is in
sight and so easily attained.

The offer of the huge reward for evidence as to the

tempting, and as soon as some one' is arrested against
whom there â¢ appears a chain of circumstantial evi
dence, or whose record is in any way clouded by sus
picion, there will come forth a ready perjurer to tes
tify against him and gain the coin. Rewards that
lead to the conviction of criminals. may be necessary
at times, but whenever they are offered great, care
should be exercised to guard against the perjury to
which they tempt the vicious.

INDUCEMENTS TO PERJURY.
I |DR the purpose of bringing about the arrest
j and conviction of the assassin of Goebel the
Kentucky Legislature has offered the enormous
reward of $100,000. The magnitude of the sum has
given rise to a good deal of discussion upon the ex
pediency of offering such large rewards for the con
viction of offenders, and the prevailing opinion ap
pears to be that they tend not "so much to promote
justice as to defeat it by the inducements they hold
out to persons willing to commit perjury for coin.
A recent case in Missouri is cited as an illustration
of the wrongdone in that way. A reward of $3000
was offered for evidence that would convict the as
sassins of a Mr. Bennett, a prominent citizen of St.
Louis. Three young men were arrested because of
circumstances which led them to be suspected. Then
a negro woman came forward and identified them as
the guilty persons. She swore she had seen them
running away from the victim; she had seen the
face of one (McDonald) distinctly, and heard the
others call him by name. McDonald was able to
prove an alibi and was acquitted, but the other two
were convicted, and would have been hanged, had
not the Governor distrusted the woman's testimony
and commuted their sentence to life imprisonment.
The rest of the story is told by the Philadelphia
Kecord. thus: "A few months ago this same woman
as a witness in another murder case swore to what
was a physical impossibility, was tried for perjury
and sent to prison for seven years. A detective, who
looked up her record, discovered that she had been
a professional perjurer for years at Kansas City; and
had fled to St. Louis to escape prison. She was two
miles from the scene of Bennett's murder when ' it
occurred, and all she knew of it she learned from the
newspapers. When the reward was offered. she told
several friends that she intended to get the money."
It is not likely there have been many cases of that
kind in the United States, for the number of persons
willing to commit a perjury that dooms an innocent
man to the gallows is small. Still there is abundant
evidence that perjury has become an altogether: too
frequent crime among us. We do. not have to go
away from San Francisco to find that evidence.' In
fact,' perjury has become so common as to constitute
a menace to the community. Moreover, it is to be
As two successive Boards of Health have now tried
to work the city for money by getting up a bubonic
plague scare, and each attempt has failed, there will
piobably be no further resort for some time to come
to that particular trick. One of the effects of the
fr.ilures. however, will be a feeling of incredulity on
the part of the people at any announcement of pes
tilence, even if it should happen to be true.
WHEELER'S NOTIONS.
GENERAL WHEELER, who has just returned
lrnm the Philippines with a military commis
sion and a certificate of election to Congress
among the honors that blush upon him, has pre
sfceted his plan for the government of the Philippines.
Like many other expansionists, he looks upon the
islands as old-fashioned bee-keepers used to look
t'l>on tbe hive, as full of honey and easy to rob. He
tslks about American push in a climate where there
is no push and no productive labor except that of
Chinese coolies, and he wants the islands, including
liie domain of his friend, the Sultan of Sulu, ad
mitted as a Territory and set in the path that leads
to statehood.
Tins i' undoubtedly to be the plan on which the
Bryan Democracy will compromise. The people
should never assent to it. None of these tropical isl
ands should ever be put in line to be States. It will
hr better to sell them as torrid junk in the second
hand markets of the world than to incur such a peril.
I'ut them up at a national rag fair, make an interna
tional St. Audrey auction, get rid of them in any
vyay. rather than permit them to cherish any hope of
.American statehood.
Just how much the people are going to stand in the
line of expansion and insular nonsense and folly none
car. tell now. We are putting a tariff of 15 per cent
on Porto Rican products and are to hand the whole
proceeds, a tax levied on the American people, back
to the Porto Ricans! It is compelling Americans to
pay Porto Ricans a bounty of 15 per cent on their
products! As the capitalists of Porto Rico hire la
bor at 20 cents a day, cheap wages at home and an
American bounty of 15 per cent ought to make them
quite comfortable.
A look into the maze of contradictions, plans,
propositions and schemes that hovers over this ques
tion is like looking into the jjrimacing faces at the
windows of a madhouse. A Southern Democratic
Senator is shouting. "Hold the Philippines; magni
ficent market for Southern cotton," when the islands
can produce all the cotton and garment fabrics they
c? n consume. " Another breaks into a smallpox of
enthusiasm over the opportunity to establish manu
factures in Manila to compete with the home manu
fr.ctTires. while a third is assuring the home manufac
turer of a great market among the Tagals, Pampan-
Koes and Negritos. While the merry madness goes
on. the people of the paradise of the West Indies
are reported to be starving to death on account of
their surplus production of the necessaries of life!
General Wheeler adds his recipe to the list of nos
trums already on file, and will soon appear in Con
press to add to the Democratic situation his vast
Â«tore of nmviÂ«dom on the subject.

The Harbor Commissioners made a
thorough inspection of the water front
yesterday. They took one of Peterson s
launches and went under all the struc

to be badly in n^ed of replling. but it was
a pelf-evldent fact - that nearly all the
piers can be lengthened at little more ex

DARKNESS, PLAGUE, BANKRUPTCY.
SAN FRANCISCO in reality stands at the dawn
of a new day. All the natural conditions of the
time are brightening in the glow of an increas
ing prosperity, not only in the city itself and in the
State, but in the East, where her present markets
are, and in the Orient, where her developing trade is
rapidly expanding. Very different, however, is the
aspect of the municipal administration. Under
Mayor Phelan and his combine our affairs have been
so administered that it would seem the new era be
gan not with the dawri, but the twilight. Steadily the
shadows have darkened and the gloom increased.
Now, with streets unlighted, we have the city re
ported to be infected with the bubonic plague, and
steps taken which tend to produce the impression it
is financially bankrupt.
The Finance Committee of the Supervisors have
under consideration a proposal to borrow $250,000
from public-spirited citizens to relieve the "financial
stringency." For the purpose of carrying out the
plan it is proposed the citizens shall advance the
money, and then $20,000 of the amount be used to de
fray the expense of an election to authorize the is
suance of bonds to repay the loan. The project, it
will be perceived, is a very pretty one. The citizens
are to loan the money and take chances on an elec
tion to authorize the city to repay it.
If the scheme be carried out we trust the public
spirited citizens will fare better than did the man who
advanced money to the State to relieve the farmers
of the drought-stricken sections of Monterey and
San Luis Obispo counties. That money, it will be
remembered, by the spite of Governor Gage, remains
to this day unpaid, and if citizens are going to put
their trust in the city on a similar venture, they would
best assure themselves beforehand that Phelan will
not work the Gage gouge ,on them in the end.
The fact that this scheme for raising money has
been brought forward will of course be taken advan
tage of by yellow journals to discredit the city. It
is another blight which Phelanism has put upon the
community. It .follows close upon the sensational
scheme of taking a diseased Chinaman and turning
his dead body into a means of getting up a scare over
the bubonic plague. Through the organ of the Mayor
snd his Board of Health the world at large has been
induced to believe that San Francisco is infected wit'n
pestilence, and now we are to have the further ill re
pute of being unable to pay our debts.
The evil effects and influences of these repeated acts
of municipal maladministration are far-reaching, and
the full extent of the injury they have inflicted will
perhaps never be known. The absence of street
lighting at night, for example, entails much more
than the discomfort it gives to. the public and the
advantage it confers on criminals. It has seriously
incommoded the Fire Department, for the engines
cannot with safety be driven through dark streets at
full speed. Thus the danger of fires is greater and
insurance companies begin to look upon city prop
erty as a more doubtful risk than before. So the evil
spreads from one interest to another, and the total mr
jury is enormous. ,
A striking illustration of the effects of Phelanism is
to be seen in the contrast between the black dark
ness of the midnight streets of the city itself and the
lighted water front. During his campaign Phelan was
loud in his claims that the water front and the docks
should be under the control of the municipality in
stead of the State. It was his frequent declaration
that under municipal administration the water front
would be better managed than by the State officials,
and many believed him. The water front under
State control is lighted, while the city. under Phelau
is in darkness.
Thus at the very beginning of the new era Phelan
ifm has brought upon the community three blight
ing cloudsâ reputed plague, reputed bankruptcy and
actual darkness. It is a dreary record, but, fortu
nately, there is in the situation itself the consolation
that it can be no worse. The wild Examiner reports
of bubonic plague will die out, the street lamps will
be relighted after a time, and the financial stringency
will pass away. Even in the better times, however,
the effects of the present evils will linger to the in
jury of the community, and we shall suffer many a
day from the consequences of Phelan's method of
"doing politics."
Pleased with the prospect that the census of this
year will show that South Carolina is the second
largest cotton manufacturing State in the Union, the
people of Charleston propose to hold a grand inter
state exposition in 1901 to advertise the fact and show
the world what the South is doing.

slder himself entitled to a "look In" when
the glory for the preservation of tho
groves Is being apportioned. Even tht-
President himself, as he affixes his auto
graph to the resolution, will probably have
the effrontery to consider that in so doing
he has been in some measure Instru
mental in staying the ax.
Not so, Mr. President. Not so, all and
singular, the rest of you. In the city,
perched on the extreme outer rim of the
Sunsetland, the throbbing, presses have
blazoned to the world the legend:
"Through the Examiner .the big trees will
be spared the woodman's ax."
And now. Mr. President, and the rest of
you, will you be good and allow us to
concentrate our gratitude upon the man
who alone stood off the woodman's ax ?
It is all the more ungenerous to attempt
to subdivide and divert the credit thua
declared to be all his very own at a time
when, thrusting aside his editorial writ
ers, he is personally wrestling with the
Hay-Pauncefote business In an agony to
which great primer Is hardly equal to the
task of giving adequate typographical ex
pression.
It will be observed that the Examiner
man simply claims that his "efforts to
save those natural wonders, the giant
trees of California, have been successful."
Mark the limit beyond which his modesty
would not go. What, had it not been for
this limit, was to have prevented him
claiming that at some remote period of
previous Incarnation he had Influenced the
Creator in planting those trees, or even
that he had sown the seeds himself? Ab
solutely nothing but that exceeding mod
esty which permits the dead heroes of the
Maine to share with him the distinction
of precipitating the war with Spain, and
which alone stands In the way of his con
testing the other William's exclusive cl<um
to partnership with God.

A2TDSEMENTS.
BECAUSE her husband had ceased
to love her, Mrs. Thomas Costigan,
a comely young woman living at
343 Jessie street, attempted to com
mit suicide in Crowley & Green's saloon,
14 Mason street, yesterday morning by
Ewallowing a dose of carbolic acid. She
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Bunnell applied the usual rem
edies, and it is probable that she will re
cover, although she would prefer to die.
The case is a pitiable one. Mrs. Cos
tigan was married to her husband, Tnom
as Costigan. a rambler, eight years ago.
She is a pister of James Lally, a deputy
Assessor. They lived happily together,
and two children were born to them, a
girl now -seven years of age and a boy
two years. That her husband was un
faithful to her never occurred to her till
a few days ago. He had gone to Seattle,
but returned recently. A letter that had
been sent him by a woman to Seattle
was re-directed to this city, and when it
came to the house Mrs. Costlgan's sus-
Eiclons were aroused for the first time,
he opened the letter and her suspicions
were confirmed; her husband had been
untrue to his marriage vows. She
had still faith in him. as she thought the
woman might not know that he was a
married man, but a subsequent letter
which she opened yesterday morning dis
pelled that Illusion, as reference was
made In it to her. She was driven almost
crazy by the fact, and as she had not
seen her husband since Monday night she
determined to go In search of him and
try to win him back.
She sent the little girl to the Lincoln
School, and taking the baby to her sister
in-law, Mrs. Lally, started out on her
quest. She went Â¦to several places, but
could not get any Information as to her
husband or the woman, whose letters to
her husband had. not been signed. Then
she went to a drug store and purchased
two bottles of carbolic acid, a one-ounce
bottle and a four-ounce bottle, and called
at Crowley & Green's saloon as a last
chance. She could get no Information
there, and going Into a side room she
swallowed the contents of the one-ounce
bottle.
"I cannot live without my husband's
love,'" she said, "and want to die. We
lived so happily together, and if an angel
from heaven had told me he was untrue
to me I would not have believed it. Oh.
why did I open that letter? I have
done everything a wife could for him and
it is cruel for him to deceive me so. What
are my children to me without my hus.
band?" Shn would not be comforted and
declared that If she recovered she would
be more successful next time.

WORLD FAR TOO
REBELLIOUS FOR
SPIRITUAL GOOD
Father Yorke Discusses
Prosperity Gauged by
Man and (rod.
Eloquent Divine Asserts That Reli
gion Is to the Soul What
the State Is to the
Body.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke lectured last even
ing at St. Mary's Cathedral on the "Can
ons of Prosperity." The speaker dwelt at
length on the natural and supernatural
faculties of man. and of that continual
conflict which cannot be termed the ret
Eistance of the body to the spirit, but ia
more properly reason's rebellion against
the spirit's influence.
"We are persuaded," said the speaker,
"that what the spirit tells us Is correct.
If the reason was left to itself and was
not in continual conflict with the body
the dictates of the spirit would prevail.
The world Is on one side of the great
conflict, the spiritual kingdom on the
other*. The latter is composed' of those
who have left the world, and the world
hates them. If they were still of the
world the world would .love them. The
great majority on this earth are scattered,
like the flock without a shepherd, not
knowing the image pt the Lord, and in
continual conflict wltn all that Is spiritual.
"The mind belongs to the world. It
thinks according to Its ways and Judges
everything and everybody by . its own
canons. The world does not believe in the
kingdom of God. It says that It is not of
the world, and consequently the world
does not believe In it or love it.
"The world is merely the name applied
to man, organized for his own needs. It
Is the human race organized for its own
benetlt. We must give up part of our
personal liberty for the good of allâ in
other words, for the benefit of the State.
The man who minds his own business
need not bother his head about the laws
of the State. The laws are made for
those who break them. The result of this
is tranquillity. When men are not satis
fled with the conditions which surround
them they are privileged to say so. Free
speech Is a kind of safety valve that lets
off the surplus steam of public discontent.
"Peace, order, quietness and a certain
amount of prosperity are needed for the

"Ancient- Legends and Modern Facts"
was the subject of an eloquent discourse
delivered last night In Temple Emanu-El
by Rev. Dr. Voorsanger. He told of the
beautiful legends to be found in the his
tory of the Hebrews and drew special at
tention to Queen Esther, who saved her
people from persecution and probable
death. He told the legend In all its beau
ty and took occasion to dwell on the per
secution of the Jews through succeeding
centuries, despite which the race has
thrived.

rimanded last evening by Chief Sullivan
In the presence of all the members of the
Southern station' for having arrested re
spectable citizens without cause.
Deeley was recently fined $100 by the
Police Commissioners for the offense,
and In addition was ordered to suffer the
humiliation of being reprimanded in the
presence of his fellow-officers.
A few minutes before 6 o'clock last even
ing the members of the Southern station
were lined up in the assembly room, the
men forming a cordon around the offi
cer who was to be reprimanded. Chief
Sullivan then appeared, and, addressing
Deeley, said: - ,
"When I assumed command of the po
lice force of this city T addressed the
men and made particular reference to
the very offense of which you have been
found guilty by the Board of Police Com
missioners. At tha,t time I earnestly tried
to impress you and the other members
of the department with the necessity of
treating all citizens with the utmost cour
tesy and of using common-sense in mak
ing arrests. Within a week after I thus
spoke to you I find you in discharge of
your duties as a police officer arresting
three menâ one a veteran of the Civil
Warâ without the slightest provocation:
Why you should have done so I am at a
loss to explain. In reprimanding you I
want to impress on your mind that such
offenses will not be tolerated in the Po
lice Department. I therefore, in the pres
ence or your fellow-officers, administer
the reprimand In the hope that it will be
of - benefit -to you in the future, as well
as to the other members of the police
Deeley listened to the words of the
Chief unflinchingly, but seemed relieved
when It was all over. .

afternoon in his room in the lodglng-houss
at 6T,7 Bush street.
Deceased was in the employ of the real

land are named as legatees, and which
reads: "All my parents are dead. There
is no one lirlng who has any claims on mÂ«*
for support. I was never married, and my
only relatives are those mentioned in my
will." Deceased left bank books showing
accounts with theHlbernla Bank, Savings
and Loan Society and San Francisco Sav
ings Union, and a certificate of deposit on
the Bank of California for $285. He was

fully that she was commissioned to palift
twenty-nine more portraits of the gay
young queen. As painter and subject
were about the same age, they soon dis
covered many tastes in common. Mme.
Le Brun had a silvery voice and frequent
ly sang duets with the queen when the
latter was weary of sitting for her num
erous portraits. Marie Antoinette soon
became truly fond of the unassuming,
simply dressed little artist, who in turn
felt the more romantic affection for her
royal patron, whom she declared to walk
"better than any woman in France. hold-

whlch denoted the sovereign in the midst
of her court, without this majestic bear
ing detracting in the least from the

Mme. Le Brim's friendship with royalty
naturally subjected her during the revo
lution to many terrifying experiences.
Sulphur was thrown into her cellar, and
ominous murmurings and fist-shakings
plainly hinted that if sne would escape
the scaffold she must leave France at

Here her busy brush reaped for her the
same golden harvest that she had gar
nered In Paris. Orders, for portraits of
distinguished foreigners poured In upon
her, not least among which was one
from the Pone. Pius ,VI. When Mme. Le
Brun learned, however, that she must be
veiled while painting his Holiness, she
doubted her ability under such trying cir
cumstances to do justice to the subject.
BIOGRAPHICAL STUDIES F"OR GIRLS.
IV. MMB LE BBUN.
(1755-1542.)
BY CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN
When a reader happens upon the name
of Mme. Le Brun he is aware of a pleas
urable feeling, at first indefinable but
which, traced to its source, is generally
found to have been produced by some one
of the many pleasing portraits of nerself
now so widely and favorably known. Each
gives an impression of a vivacious and
winsome personality, whether â¢it be the
portrait which she painted of herself as a
turbaned young woman looking out with
smiling countenance from her easelâ the
one. which, in the Ufflzl gallery. Florence,
elicited so much notice from Goetheâ the
similar painting in the Hermitage at St.
Petersburg or those charming pictures ct
herself and daughter known as the "little
idyls on canvas," which hang In the Lou
vre.
In her Ingenious autobiography she has
supplemented these brush portraits with
accounts of the brilliant court pageants
which she witnessed in the various coun
tries of Europe in sharp contrast f> the
meager poverty of her home surroundings,
of the terrors of the revolution, ot' thÂ«
wit or peculiarities of those whom she
met, together with shrewd little charac
ter sketches and impressions of her trav
els. This self-illustrated autobiography Is
something unique in the history of art
and throws a curious side light upon the
circumstances attending the palntln? of
the Immense number of pictures, nearly
1000 In all, which make the best monument
to the lifelong industry of Mme. VigÂ£e Le
Brun.
A less pretentious painter than her fair
contemporary, Angelica Kauffmann, the
greater .beauty and simplicity of her worn
have better stood the test of time.
Daughter of a third-rate Parisian copy
ist whose chalk studies and pastels after
Watteau were pleasing, but strikingly de
void of originality. Mile. Vigfee attracted
notice by her precocity while a very tiny
child. At the time of her father s d*atn.
a girl of 13. she was a portrait painter oi
no mean ability, already beginning to ful
fill her father's prophecy: "^ou shall be a
painter, my daughter, or there never was
one!" Vernet. the eminent marine palnte. .
urged her to present an excellent portrait
of her mother, which she finished at the
age of 15. for admission to the Academy:
but her application was refused on ac
count of her extreme youth.
Besides the fond encouragement of her
father, the young girl was favored in h-vv
ine Brlard, Davesne, Doyen and Clnude
Joseph Vernet as her teachers. The last
named frequently cautioned .her against
following the methods of any Particular
school "Only consult, my child, tha
works of the great Italian and Flcm sh
masters: but. above all." he urged "do
as much as you can from nature. Nature
fs {he best master. If you study It dili
gently you will never get into manner
isms /' This sensible advice had much to
do with the formation of Mile. \ig^. s
orielnal style, which waa quite apart from
the Tcontempo'rary academic Jnfl^nc^ Â£Â«
self-improvement was largely Â«"f Â» her
untiring copying of Rembrandt. \ an D\ck

miraculous) and Greuze. Much of this
work was quickly sold in order that the
young artist might support her bjanttful
but Indolent mother and clothe and edu

who greedily wore the old clothes of the
dead artist, but refused to provide the
n^Â£xÂ»aries of life for his new family.
S^lUnf the already overworked Eline
to^edoubfe her efforts for their mainten
ance On account of that superb health
which enabled her to work unceasingly
until her death in her eighty-seventh
year, the young girl's beauty did notfade
under this 111 treatment, but developed so
charmingly that between the ages of 14
andlo 'sitters flocked to her studio and
her orders multiplied amazingly, chiefly
that her admirers while posing might en
joy her vivacious society. This Implied
flattery never cost the young artist the
loss of her simplicity or reputation, her
mother's enforced presence preventing
any suggestion of stain upon her name.
At that time the family lodged in the
house of a picture dealer. Jean Baptlste
Pierre Le Brun. a man whose Judgment
upon pictures was considered the most
reliable In Europe. His unusually flne
co ection of paintings and prints was
obligingly placed at the service of the
eager young portrait painter. JVhen Le
Bimn offered, himself in: marriage six
months late? Mlle..VlgÂ«e yielded to the
persuasion? 'of her worldly mother,
who fancied the picture dealer to
be very rich, and reluctantly con
Â«fTnt*<l to a secret marriage until Le
Brun could clelr himself of certain obli
gations to the daughter of a picture trader
in Holland. Meanwhile the Influential
friends of the artist, not knowing of this,
stronelv urged her not to marry the man.
insisting that she would better cut her
throat or drown herself than ally her In
terests with those of a man whose low
tastes weuld make happiness an Impos
sibility. All too late the young wfe
learned the bitter truth of their predic
tions, and found that she had simply ex
changed her slavery. to her stepfather for
a â¢ lifelong servitude even more galling.
Her husband compelled her to take pupils
and gambled with herjmoney as fast as
she earned it. -Â»o that : In 1789. thirteen
years after her marriage, she left France
without 20 of the .1.000.000 francs which she
had meanwhile earned. ' Â¦.
The birth of her little girl. Jeanne, two
years'after her marriage, was the one ray
of sunshine In 'the deplorable life of this
111-treated wife, who. worked uncomplain
ingly from dawn till dark, declaring that
her whole life i was henceforth devoted to
two Â¦ objectsâ her daughter and- her art.
During the Infancy of little Jeanne the
artist mother â¢ while walking in the park
was accosted by Mary f Antoinette.' who
invited her to paint her portrait. ' This
Mme. Le Brun accomplished so neemmm.
and therefore declined the honor. Be
sides many other famous portraits she
painted two noteworthy ones of Lady
Hamilton, one as a bacchante reposing on
the seashore, another as a sybilâ fine pic
tures of a beautiful subject, which as
works of art afterward sold In London
for many times their original value. In
Rome she also met Angelica Kauffmann.
with whom she was most favorably Im
pressed.
Leaving the Eternal City, the artist-ex
ile traveled over Europe, everywhere re
ceived with distinction, and admitted into
the membership of the- Academies of Par
ma, Rome, Bologna, Berlin. Geneva. St.
Petersburg, Rouen and Paris.
In Prussia she painted a portrait of
the much-loved Queen Louise. In Brus
sels she had painted (1753) the famous
portrait of herself In a straw hat after
Rubens' much-admired "Chapeau de
Faille," which gained her admission to
the French Academy.
In Russia a palace was placed at her
disposal, and here she painted many por
traits of the royal family. The Empress
Catherine the Great also engaged a por
trait of herself, but mvhÂ» stricken with
apoplexy before the day appointed for her
sitting.
England was not behind the rest of the
Continent In conferring honors upon MmÂ©.
Le Brun, whose portraits Sir Joshua Rey
nolds declared "as fine as those of any
painter, not excepting Van Dyck." Geor-
E in nsi, the witty and bwiutiful Duchess of
levonshlre: Mrs. Slddons, Herschel and
his gifted sister, and the Prince of Wales,
afterward George IV, also showed her
great honor.
In spite of all the distinction and wealth
heaped upon her she was never truly
happy, although Invariably cheerful. She
who was reported to be so rich that she
lit her fire with bank notes and fed It with
aloes wood was in reality always poor,
dressing most simply In the muslin gown
and kerchief popularized by her portraits,
because of the immense sums which she
constantly sent home to support her hus
band, mother or daughter. In Russia she
managed to save during the first month
of her stay 45,000 francs, but the banker
with whom she deposited them failed and
she lost all. Later on 15.000 francs was
stolen from her.
Her greatest erief. however, was the
unfortunate marriage of her only daugh
ter, to whose education she had devoted
so much time and money. This child bad
always been a great comfort to her
mother, because of her sweet disposition,
but at the age of 17 she conceived a ro
mantic affection for an Impecunious sec
retary. When Mme. Le Brun assured her
that the man was merely attracted by her
beauty and was "without talent, fortune
or family" the daughter became so ill
that the mother was forced to consent,
giving her as a marriage portion the re
sult of her St. Petersburg earnings. With
in five years this daughter ceased to carÂ©
for her husband, refused to return to Rus
sia with him. and lived a gay life In Paris,
while her mother was working on the
Continent.
She died five years before her mother,
and grief over her death, preceded by that
of the artist's mother and brother, so
preyed " upon the strength of Mme. Le
Brun that she died at the age of 87, after
a life of extraordinary energy.
Tn spite of the drudgery of her unappre
ciated servitude for others. Mme. Le Brun
was always generous and cheerful, lov
able In her old age as in her youth, and.
like her picture, always pleasing.

heavy Argentine shipments of 3.2-0,000 bushels.

Exporters expected Rome orders of fair vol
ume to-day and, Â¦ together with lighter receipts
than looked for, tended to develop firmness of
undertone In the market for evaporated apples.
But as advices from country sources were un
favorable mey served to check any advance in
prices here. At the close, however, the market
was firm, - with the tendency toward a higher
level of value. â¢
California dried fruits were quiet and barely
steady, owing to liberal off erings - and a light
supply. Prices, however, remained unchanged.

London Market.
NEW YORK. March 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Details of the war loan were announced to-day.
It is for Â£30.000.000 at SS\i, with Interest at
2% per cent, redeemable at par in 1910. Post
offlcec are not mentioned for the reception of
applications, but bids have been received at all
the London banks and leading brokers' offices.
The Drospectus was not issued during business
hours, but there was considerable dealing In
options at 2 per cent premium. Pronounced
success for the Issue is certain.
The markets here were dull and featureless
to-day. It Is expected that the public will
begin to take an Interest in the markets again
when the loan is out of the way. Consols
were up %d. despite the fact that the war
loan was due. Americans were particularly
idle and heavy in tone on overnight cable or
ders to sell. Paris bought Spanish 4's and
Tintos, but Anacondas relapsed 3-16 after yes

There was no gold movement. Call money
was easy and bills were flrm but plentiful. A

during the week that the payments of pensions
would decrease the absorption of funds by the

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW TORK, March 9.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
A certain hesitation In business with shrink
age In its volume Is not unusual nor unnatural
at this season. It is not necessarily'disheart
ening, therefore, if business is no longer as large
In volume as ever, but falls behind that of
February or January or of the corresponding
week last year. Strikes in building trades or
of machinists and others ,at Chicago affect
many industries and the wages of 50,000 hands.
The remarkable rise in cotton has apparently
met the expected reaction, which tends for the
time to repress business. A few great cor
porations are striving to hold prices without
regard to present demand, hoping that the needs
of the consumers may prevent reaction and re
new the rise of last year. Wide differences of
opinion also exist regarding the reports of
monetary action by Congress.
Special causes are not needed to account for
some pause after a year of unprecedented buy
ing. That such trade could not continue with
out a cause is evident, as there is not the
speculation which threatened monetary trouble
a year aso.
The outDut of iron furnaces March 1 was
192,643 tons weekly, . against 298,014 February 1,
and unsold stocks increased 35,516 tons in Feb
ruary, making consumption 40.920 tons daily,
against 41.642 in January. Temporary stoppage
of four furnaces near Plttsburg.by a strike and
the â¢ reduction of output of many . furnaces \n
blast, perhaps In part desired and in part the
effect of scarcity of coke, have supported prices
of pig and of finished products, the only change
being a slight decline In plates." Much busi
ness Is evidently deferred Just now because of
doubt regarding future prices. Connellsvllle
coke ovens are producing 219,221 tons weekly,
with 200 more ovens soon to be added, but coke
is hard to get even at $3 50 for furnace. Cotton
sold on Monday at 9.81, the highest point slrfce
January 10. 1593, when the crop suddenly fell
from 9.000,000 to 6.000,000 bales. A sharp reac
tion came Wednesday and the price dropped
3-16 that day and closed U below the high
est, point. While the demand for immediate
use has held goods strong there has been for
some time small desire to make contracts
ahead. â¢
Estimates of wheat In farmers' hands March
1. 1C4,000,00i> liushols, according to the American
Acriculturist, do not indicate a lack of supply
this year, for with 54,000,000 bushels in visible
stock? there is in sight nearly as much as a
year a:o, when foreign demands were extraor
dinary and yet the crop year ended with over
33,000,000 bushels In visible supply. This year
net exports In seven months, flour included,
have been 111.221,835 bushels, against 149,916,407
last year In February, Â¦ enough to make about
125,000,000 bushels, . against 168,000,000 last year,
with po indication of a future foreign demand
approaching that of last . year from March 1
to July 1. Returns as to condition of winter
wheat are also satisfactory, but of late prices
have been very low and have advanced this
week nearly 3c for spot and lc for May op
tions.
Â¦ London sales, so long awaited by speculators
here to lift up prices again, opened with a se
vere decline of 7%Â®10 per cent, causing such
disappointment that much selling Is likely, es
pecially as manufacturers who have held out
of the market for some months have still I too
large stocks of wool and too uncertain a mar
ket for goods to be in haste. Prices had dix
vlously declined a little her*," but with small
transactions. The business in goods,, though
less active than has been expected. Is at fairly
steady prlcesvas yet. In boots and shoes there
It no change in quotations, though not an
eighth of the usual orders for boots has been
given and not a quarter for men's or women's
heavy shoes, while the demand for light shoes
has been the smallest in flve years. Shipments
on former orders have been less than in 1898,
but larger than In the corresponding week of
any other year. , Â¦ :â¢Â¦
Failures last week TÂ«rere In amount $3,482,827,
manufacturing $118,651 and trading $2,161,211.
Failures for the week have been 205 in the

late . spring and summer of the present year.
Nor does Wall street give ear to the migges
tlons of a dangerous inflation for this cause,
but Is Inclined to take a favorable though
conservative view of the probabilities. Lon
don has continued to be a purchaser of secur
ities in the market, although upon a rather
moderate I scale. The announcement by the
British Government of the war loan Issue of
2% per cent for Â£30,000,000 had been fully dis
counted and there seems to be no anticipa
tion of financial . pressure In the foreign mar
kets from that cause. In fact the hardening
of money in London has been vÂ«ry slight and
It may be noted that foreign exchange at New
York fell sharply, this week .on account of
the heavy offerings of bills against European
purchases of cotton. Railroad earnings con
tinue to be of the most favorable character. ?
CHICAGO. March 9.â The wheat market was
active, irregular and Influenced by two strong
but opposing Influencesâ the Indifference of ca
bles and the enormous Argentine shipments
against the strength of the Liverpool spot mar
ket and the big cash business here. The record
breaking exports from the ether side of the
equator and the indifference of Liverpool to the
advance here yesterday were felt early. May
opening %c depressed at 65%<f?66c. The selling
was Â¦ probably a little too heavy.' for the news
of the spot advance at Liverpool caused liberal
covering by shorts. The prediction of a cold
wave was also an â¢ Incentive : lor buying, and
as a big . cash business was reported under
way May shot rapidly up to 6C%c The bulge
was met with liberal profit-taking, but the sales
were readily absorbed at reduced prices.
The " close caught the market on the return
trip from 66Â«S66ttc, where it had been forced by
the desire for profits, and the close was %@%c
down nt 66%e for May, which, despite the fact
that it was under last night's close, was con
sidered , a good Indication of strength. The
cash business here was put at 290,000 bushels,
200,000 bushels of it for export.
The corn market was strong and active. The
opening was easy with wheat, but later there
was a recovery, nearly all of which was held.
May closed %c over yesterday.
. Oats were flrm, apparently In sympathy with
jcorn, but quiet. Shorts were buyers, and there
was a fair demand for shipment. May closed

The provisions market was quiet, but steadied
in sympathy with the strength in corn, and the
Liverpool advance in hams ami. lard. May pork

NEW TORK,. March 9.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say: \ Relieved from the hamper
ing effects of stormy weather general trade
distributions have shown a tendency to ex
pand this week, prices^ of many staples are
firmer and higher and generally there Is a
better tone than noted for some weeks. Easily
holding first rank in the matter of speculative
activity cotton early in the week touched the
highest level, not only for the, present season,
but for at least six years past. A sharp breaK,
due to" realizing, has brought the level down
again, however, to a point where new buying
by sold-out bulls Is Invited.
Print cloths and In fact all classes of man
ufactured cotton have sympathized in _tne
strong tone of the raw staple and the nrst
mentioned product reached 3V4c this week, the
highest ' po!Â«t for several years past. Com
plaints of backward deliveries of cotton goods
continue, pointing to the urgent demand for
supplies.
Wool is rather weaker following the drop In
prices at the London sale and the rather slow
demand from American manufacturers, who,
being apparently well supplied at present, are
content to let the raw staple take care of
Itself while obtaining a good market and fair
prices for the manufactured product. â¢
By i another one of the short swings which
have distinguished wheat prices for a long
time past quotations have been advanced this
week from the low level touched some time
ago partly as the result of less favorable re
ports from the winter-sown crops In the several
Western States and partly because of the ap
parent unwillingness of country holders to fol
low the market down. The checking of in
terior receipts has apparently been sufficient
to allow of the steady demand for wheat and
flour, and In a lesser degree corn, to be re
flected In floating stocks. Other staples also
showing reactions from late weakness are lard,
coffee, butter and cheese.
Among staples showing declines and weak
ness might be particularly mentioned sugar,
which is lower both- for raw and refined grades.
Boot and shoe manufacturers are actively em
ployed and leather Is flrm, but hides -are
weaker or lower at most markets. Building
materials are flrm, except at cities where labor
troubles are apprehended/ , â¢
Despite a rather smaller production In Feb
ruary, due partly to disturbances growing out
of weather conditions, stocks of some classes
of pig iron are larger, but no appreciable
effect appears to be exercised upon prices.
There is a steady distribution of hardware,
both light and heavy, at many points. : Among
other metals copper is firmer, the mainspring
of activity being apparently located In London,
which market is reported cornered.
The industrial situation Is rather Irregular
owing partly to the combined strike and lock
out of 60,000 building hands, building material
workers and machinists at Chicago and partly
to isolated strikes of small numbers of men
throughout the country. OnHhe other hand
especially encouraging features are found In
the iron and fcteel industry, whfre 35.000 em
ployes have had their wages further advanced.
Agreements between employers and employed
have resulted In a further advance of the
puddling rate at many Western works. Wages
are now nearly 60 per cent higher than a year
ago and for this particular class of work are
at the highest point reached in twenty years.

Harrison's circular says: "There have fcÂ»m
the following arrivals of Coal this week: Six
from Washlngtonr 17,193 tons; four from British
Columbia. 4900 tons; one from Oregon, 540 tons;
one from New York, 402 tons; one from Japan,
3600 tons; one from Australia, 3371 tons; total.
30,008 tons. The amount at hand is fully equal
to our weekly consumption, so the situation Is
unchanged, and there Is now a general filing
that henceforward consumers will have but lit
tle cause for complaint. Prices remain as be
fore; there Is but little anticipation of any in
cline, as Coal carriers are demanding extreme
rates from all coal-producing ports on th*
coast: hence, there will be no shrinkage of
values while the present schedule for freights
prevails, which It certainly will atl this year.
"Freights from Australia are softening, which
they certainly must In the early future, as thcr*
is every inducement for ship owners to seeic
this port, if the vessels are adapted to carry
grain, while the present outward freights su3
taln themselves. The present asking coal
freights from the Colonies preclude Â»hlpment.i.
as consumers can fill their requirements mora
economically from the coast products, and de
liveries are more regular, â¢ and are assured;
whereas, there Is always an uncertainty about
the arrival of sailing vessels. Shipments frnm
Great Britain are Impossible, as coals are not
procurable."

MRS. DARNEAL IS
NOT RECONCILED
TO THE WEDDING
Her Daughter to Be Married
To-Morrow, but She Will
Not Be Present.
â¢ALAMEDA, March 9.â Mrs. Harvey
Darneal has not become reconciled: to the
marriage of her daughter. Miss Susie
Darneal, to Alan Bowen, and she, will not
lend her . presence to the occasion when
the wedding takes place to-morrow morn
ing in the parlors of the Unitarian church.
Rev. George R. Dodson- will officiate and
10 o'clock is the hour set for the ceremony
to be performed. Only the immediate rel
atives of the groom-elect will be present.
Immediately after the wedding the young
couple will depart' on a honeymoon trip,
and upon their return will reside with Mr.
Bowen's parents, 900 Union street.
Miss Darneal's parents, but particularly
Mrs. Darneal, are very much opposed to
their daughter's marriage to -young Bow
en. Mrs. Darneal i 3 said to be a stickler
for lineage, being herself .a Daughter of
the Revolution and descendant of notel
Southern families, and as the Bowens do
not claim to be able to trace their atock
back to Revolutionary times she affects to
have reasonable grounds for her objec
tions. Again, young Bowen Is said not to
be desirable because he is a member of a.
San Francisco firm which deals In wines.
The announcement of the 'engagement,
coupled with the statement that Mr?.
Darneal was making 1 every effort to turn
her daughter from her purpose, pet lecal
society, of which the young couple am
prominent members, agog, and the affair
was the subject for much gossip.
The wedding was first planned to take
place February 19. but when that day ar
rived the announcement was made that It
had been postponed to March 10. Mrs.
Darneal was thought to. have become re
conciled and asked that the wedding be
put off until a later date, but It has turned
out that she Is still obdurate. -
I haTe piTeu persoaal inspection to the working: of M. I. S. T. on the human system, and

ARRESTS MADE IN
LEEPER MURDER CASE
Mrs. Brouhard, Her Divorced Hus-
band and Clerk Held on War
rants Sworn to by Sheriff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 9.â The murder
of R. R. Watts, an Idaho miner sojourn
ing here, remains a mystery, although the
officers cling to the theory published in
The Call In advance of the other San
Francisco papers that his assassination
arose from the fact that he possessed In
formation damaging to the interests of
Mrs. M. E. Brouhard in the case brought
against her in San Francisco by J. M.
Leeper. So pronounced Is. this belief that
Mrs. Brouhard, her clerk, George W.
Odell, and the woman's divorced husband,
Charles Brouhard, are being held here on
complaints charging murder on the Infor
mation and belief of Sheriff Johnson.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Brouhard, Watts had been hanging about
her place of business, and she had given
orders to have him thrown out. She said
that he sought to have her buy some
mining stock from him for $50 and threat
ened that unless she did so he would In
jure her in her San Francisco case. She
said that Wednesday night, on her way
from San Francisco to Sacramento, she
supposed that Brouhard was at work up
at her Amador County mine, and she was
greatly surprised when, at Elmlra, he
walked into the train and sat down with
her. Brouhard accounts for this Incident
by saying that he had started from Sac
ramento to walk to San Francisco, and
finding that Mrs. Brouhard and Odell
were on the train, he decided to accom
pany them to Sacramento. The officers,
however, appear to believe that Brouhard
had gone as far as Elmira to apprise the
woman of the discovery of the body of
Watts.
It should be said, however, that while
Brouhard's actions prior to the discov
ery of the murder were more than sus
picious, nothing has yet been learned
pointing to the guilt of the woman.
At the inquest to-night no new facts
were brought out. and the jury returned
a verdict that Watts had come to his
death at the hands of parties unknown
to the Jury. -
WHEELER'S RESIGNATION

WASHINGTON, March 3.â The state
ment attributed to General Joe Wheeler
In a recent interview in San Francisco

quit the military service to resume his
legislative duties the matter will be con
sidered by the President after a personal
conference with him. It is said at the

was ordered home from the Philippines at
his own request as reported to the de

FINDLEY CONVICTED BY
SAN LUIS OBISPO JURY
Defaulting Tax Collector Was Cap
tured in Peru Through Pinker
ton Detective Agency.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 9.â This
morning at 9:30, after having been out
all night, the Jury reported that it found
Samuel M. Findley, late Tax Collector of
this county, guilty of embezzlement^ His
shortage to the county is about $8000. The
jury recommended the extreme mercy- of
the court.
On November 17,' 1898, Findley disap
peared. Frank L. Gilbert, Pacific Coast
manager of the Fidelity and Deposit Com
pany of Maryland, who were on Findley's
bonds, at once placed the matter in the
hands of Superintendent Vannatta of the
Plnkerton's National Detective Agency at
San Francisco and steps were at once
taken to overhaul Findley. He was traced
as far as El Paso, Texas, by the, San
Francisco office and at that point the
matter was referred to the Denver ofneo
of the Plnkerton National Detective
Agency and so J. C. Fraser, the superin
tendent of the office, took up the trace
at El Paso. Findley was traced first to
the City of Mexico and then to various
places In Mexico and finally traced to
Lima, Peru, at which place he was over
hauled and. finally consented to return to
his native State for trial. .
Findley's first trial occurred in Novem
ber, 1899, and resulted In a disagreement;
the Jury stood evenly divided on acquittal
and conviction. The second trial has been
going on for the past week and has re
sulted In his conviction.
All credit is due to the officers of the
Fidelity and Deposit Company and to
their Pacific Coastf manager, F. H. Gil
bert, and their local legal representative
in San Francisco, C. H. Wilson, for mak
ing it possible to bring Flndley back from
Peru and securing his conviction. . .

Report Probably Emanate* From
Some Scheme Vice President
Stubbs Is Trying to
Work.
The local representatives of the differ
ent railroads are worrying themselves but
little over the report that was published
yesterday to the effect that. their roads
had agreed to abolish all agencies' out
side of their respective territories. .If
this were a fact it would mean the closing
of dozens of offices . in this city and the
throwing out of employment of a great
number of men. .
As the dispatch read. . the various roads
were contemplating the closing of their
agencies here and giving their clientelo
into the hands of the Southern Pacific
and Santa. Fe to be adjusted and . dis
tributed in, an equitable manner to the
different connections of these two great
systems.
This report is credited to an interview
with a vice president of one of the "bis
Western roads," which was obtained in
Chicago. .The name, of the vice president
was not given, but according to the opin
ion of the different agents who were seen
yesterday, he is either an official of some
little jerk- water line who Is rushing into
print for the sake of reading his own elo
quence or he is speaking with the delib
erate purpose of furthering some .cinch
scheme of his own.
The latter theory is most generally ac
cepted, and the man who gossip holds re
sponsible for the statement is no less a
personage than J. C. Stubbs of the South
ern Pacific Company. The way local
agents construe the matter is that Stubbs
in speaking to some representative of the
Chicago press voiced what he would like
to ccc, and possibly what he is working
to accomplish, but not what will be done.
Said a prominent railroad man yesterday:
"Stubbs would like nothing better than
to have all the different roads close out
their agencies in this city and let him
manage their concerns. Nothing would
suit him so well as to sit at his desk and
say what this road shall have and what
shall go to that one. But his goatee will
have grown into a full beard before the
thing shall come to pass. - - Â¦ Â¦ â¢
"Do you suppose the managements of
the different Eastern and Western roads
represented in this city are foolish enough
to relinquish the patronage that they
have been working years to obtain and
place it in the hands of the Southern Pa
cific to be used as a. whip to lash them
Into line? Not much. The whole thing is
laughable. The Southern Pacific gives us
no -business now. We have built up our
own business and we route it over our
own' road. Would not our superiors bo
wise ones to turn over to Southern Pacific
control that which they have employe.!
men for years* to gather together? The
whole matter Is a cock-and-bull story and
not worthy serious consideration.
"Ac a matter of economy it.' would not
answer.. True,, many dollars, might be
saved In office rent and salaries. But
would that compensate the outside roada
for the chances they would be forced to
take? Of course, Stubbs would talk of a:i
equitable pro rata distribution of the pas
senger and freight traffic, based on the
business done by the different roads In the
last year or two. But would he keep to
tho agreement? As soon as some one of
the roads dared to rebel against the dic
tates of C. P. Huntington the attempt
would be made to force them to knuckle
under. Of course, this might bring on a
row, resulting in an annullment of tho
agreement. But where, then; would be
the business that we have been years in
acquiring?. Our roads*, would .lope more~ln
twenty-four hours than salaries will cost
them in as many years. You can safely
say 'nothing will come out of the matter If
it had any foundation to start with. The
interview is merely so much mouthing."

Musicians Opposed to Darkness.
Delegate A. Dljeau of the Musicians'
Union scored the Supervisors at the meet
ing of the Labor Council last night for
leaving the city In darkness after 12
o'clock. The musicians, he said, as a rule
are detained at their labors until after
midnight, and then they find themselves
at the mercy of thugs, obstacles on the
sidewalks and other evils too numerous to
mention. On his motion, a committee was
appointed to wait on the Supervisors ai>d
recjueat them to restore the street tights.
The cloakmakers who were locked out
by the non-union shops reported that the
boycott was working satisfactorily, and
that several of the non-union shops wÂ«jre
compelled to discharge quite a number of
their hands because patronage had been
withdrawn.

Petersen From Drowning and
Succumbed to Pneumonia.
Albert Sims, the captain of the scow
schooner Lizzie Theresa, died at the
City Receiving Hospital at half-past 1
o'clock yesterday morning and the body
was taken in charge by the Coroner. An
autopsy by Morgue Surgeon Iceland dis
closed double lobar pneumonia as the
cause of death.
The deceased, in company with Olaf
Petersen, his partner, started in a
rowboat last Wednesday night for the

waters of the bay. They drifted off
toward the . Intersection of Second and
Townsend streets, where their boat was
upset by a violent gust of wind and they
were left struggling in the water. Their
ehouts attracted the attention of persons
on the wharves, who rescued them -in a
very soaked and shivering condition.
Captain Sims collapsed as soon as
he was brought ashore, and he was taken
to the City Receiving Hospital, where he
afterward died.
Only for Petersen Captain Sims would
have drowned before both men were
reached by their rescuers. The deceased
could not ewim and Petersen held him up
and swam with him for several hundred
yards. .
BROKER SMITH LOST
SHINING TWENTIES
While' His Clerk Was Talking With
the Confederate the Sneakthief
Went Behind the Counter.
F. M. Smith, a broker doing business at
316 Montgomery street, reported to the
police yesterday morning that he had been
the victim of a sneakthlef, and that, the
experience had cost him $400 in twenty
dollar pieces, which was the sum taken
away by the thief.
At the rear of Mr, Smith's office a door
leads to Pauper Alley, and It was through
this door that. Mr. Smith says, the thief
came. The broker's aged clerk, M. W.
Weston, was the only person in the office
Just before the thief and his confederate
entered, and Mr. Smith was upstairs.
Lee D. Craig, a Notary Public, has a
desk in the office, but he was absent at
the time, it being 8:35 o'clock in the morn
ing. At that hour a man came in with a
cent piece having an eagle on the reverse
side, which coin the stranger said was
worth $40. He asked Weston Â¦ whether
such was the fact, and while Weston was
examining the coin and talking with the
man the thief came in by the back door
from Pauper Alley, sneaked behind the
counter to a. tray of gold twenty-dollar
pieces.took as many as he could carry In
both hands and sneaked back again. As
he was going through the swinging: door
leading from the office back of the coun
ter Weston caught sight of him, and was
so much astonished- that he was stricken
speechless. The thief ran into Pauper Al
ley. Weston yelled for the police, who. at
the time were maintaining quarantine in
Chinatown, and the man with the precious
cent ran out of the front door into Mont
gomery street, leaving not a scent behind
for the detectives to work upon. Mr.
Weston described the man with the cent
as being, a rather hard looking customer,
with light complexion and a black Derby
hat and coat. The thief wore a reddish
brown sack coat and â¢ vest, with gray
pants and a black stiff-rimmed highbinder
hat.

Pemocratic party, which will absorb the
Hflquit-Harriman faction of the Socialist
Labor party by agreement. The Social
l.'emocrats were happy to-day. They say
the candidacy of Deba will attract hun
dreds of thousands of voters to their
party. They profess to Â»=ee the beginning
of a great national victory.
The convention In agreeing to unite with
the Socialist Labor faction retains the
party namÂ»>â Social Democratic party.
The candidates and the. amalgamation are
to he approved by a" majority of each
party according to thÂ«Â» referendum.
Mr. Debs had previously refused to ac
cept the nomination, but finally suc
cumbs! to persuasion. It seems from the
explanations of friends that Debs has
h<*r-n applying his earnings to the extinc
tion Â«{ a debt against the American Rail
way V'nion and that he did not want to
c*aa*e until the dÂ»bt was paid. The debt
amounted to several thousand dollars.
Debs received assurances that the debt
wÂ«uld be taken off and that he would
rf-r^ive a rest of three months before en
tering the Presidential canvass.
At thfs morning's session of the con
vention the nominations of Debs and Har
riman w<Tf confirmed.

SILVER JUBILEE OF THE
REGTOR OF ST. BONIFACE
REINFORCEMENTS
ARE HURRIED TO
YOUNG AND HOOD
Rebels Make an Attack on
Aparri, but Are Driven
Away.
Spanish Prisoners Report That In
surgents Under Legaspi Have
Divided Into Small Bands
. in the Mountains.
Â«
MANILA. March 9.-Generals Young
and Hood are asking for reinforcements,
and a battalion of the Forty-eighth will
be sent to Aparri. Other troop*? will fol
low. The rebels recently persistently at
tacked Aparr* for several hours, but wen
finally driven away. Details of the affair
are lacking.
The rebels are holding reunions in the
province of North llocos. and the Red
Katipunan cross, symbolic of resistance,
is again appearing among the natives.
It is believed that the insurgent gener
ais, Tlnlo and Florhes. have been driven
by General Youne Into General Hood's
ttrrltory. soith of Aparri.
The fact that General Young Is unable,
owing to lack of troops, to maintain gar
risons in all the towns occupied has had
a bad effect on the natives.
General Bates has returned here after
leaving garrisons in the provinces of
North and South Camaiines. The expedi
tion lost seven men killed and ten wound
ed. On entering New Caceres, province
of South Camarlnes, General Bates
learned that 2000 insurgents had departed
the same day. The Americans imme
diately sent out three pursuing columns,
encountering the enemy in three email
engagements and killing a total of forty
men.
The Spanish prisoners report that the
enemy has divided into small bands in
the mountains under the leadership of
General Legaspl. The town of Irlga has
been burned by the enemy. Both prov
inces were thoroughly scouted. The in
habitants of the district of LibniAiian. in
cluding Abella, the Provincial Governor,
and other officials, are returning to their
homes. Abella has issued a proclamation
calling upon the natives to submit to the
Americans.
The liberated priests from New Caceres
report that the insurgents killed sixty
eight Chinese and forty Spaniards at the
town of Calabanga. It is estimated that
there are 100,000 bales of hemp in tho
Camarlnes provinces. Twelve hun
dred well-armed insurgents, formerly of
Cavite province, with a Chinese colonel in
command, surround the towns of Albany
and Legaspi. They have effected three
night attacks, and continually cimeu tb<j
Forty-seventh Regiment, which has . lost
eight men killed and twenty wounded in
defending- these towns.

WILL CONDUCT
A CRUSADE FOR
CITY REFORMS
Rev. Mr. Sheldon's Policy
for His Week of
Editorship.
Advance Assignments Given to Re
porters by the Minister Who "Will
Conduct a Newspaper as
Christ Would.
TOFÂ£KA. Kans., March 9.â Although
Ser. Charles M. Sheldon continues to
maintain :ibsolute silence In regard to his
plans :n edit'ng the Topeka Capital next
â¢week several significant facts came to thÂ«
surface to-dey which tend to indicate
whet ills policy will be.
RÂ«v. Mr. Sheldon to-day made several
advance assignments to Capital reporters,
one reporter wa*. instructed to locate Â«nJ
secure the naxue of the proprietor ot
e\ery joint and sampling den in town, also
the houses of ill fame. Although Dr. Shel
don refuses to diecuss the matter it Is
practically certain that he Intends to in
stitute a crusi.de arainat theee people in
his Christian daily next week. There are
V ver }^ irl >" Peaces in Topeka where liquor
!s sold contrary to the prohibition law.
nearly a doztn gambling houses art- doing
an open business. It is charged that all
such resort* arÂ© "assesoed" monthly by
the police, and It Is believed by Rev. Mr.
fcneldon'B friends that he is preparing to
institute a general crusade for municipal
reform. Â¦ .
About a year ago Rev. Mr. Eheldon dus
rulsed himself as a labcrlng man. went
*nto a drugstore and bought a bottle of
beer. The following S-.tnday he took thÂ«
beer Into his pulpit and preached a sen
sational 6ermon on how the prohibitory
law was being violated. On his testimony
the druggist was convicted and sentenced
to several months in Jail.
Another reporter for the Capital was to-
Gay assigned to write an article on the
political situation in Kansas, dwel'dng es
pecially on "ring rule." "bosslsm" and
â¢machine methods in Kansas politics."
Another reporter was assigned to investi
gate into the workings and cost of the
Topeka city government. The reporters
were Instructed to have their material in
ha^id by the beginning of next week.
Rev. Mr. Sheldon during the past few
days has epent a great deal of time in the
Capital office familiarizing himself. with
the details of the various departments,
frequently remaining at the office until
after midnight- He knows how many
words can be put in a column story and
now long It takes to set a column or page
of stuff. He has Informed himself about
the news sources of the city and State,
learned when the Associated Press reports
come in and the quantity of matter trans
mitted. The regular news writers of the
Capital who will work under Mr. Shel
don's dictation have no idea what they
will he called upon to do except as indi
cated by the assignments to-day. He has
had two conferences with them for the
purpose of learning the routine of the re
porters' dally grind. At these meetings
Mr. Sheldon asked a great many ques
tions and to all replies t-aid "Yes" and "I
Me/* tic. but did not give out much in
formation ropardinp his plans.

THE past week has been one of un
usual dullness in real estate circles
so far as actual transactions * are
concerned, although this statement
should not be taken : to Indicate any
falling off In the business of the brokers
or a weakening of the demand for good in
vestment properties. A â¢ number iof sales
have been recorded, several of them In
volving sums around the 120,000 mark and
two or three deals were practically closed
which will foot up into the hundreds of
thousands." That there was somewhat
less inquiry than during the previous week
was undoubtedly due to the, rain, but
brokers are very well satisfied; with the
existing conditions and no complaints are
heard.
There Is considerable speculation as to
the character of the building which Mr.
Flood will erect on the Baldwin Hotel
site, and while the opinion is freely ex
pressed that Â¦ a great hotel would be thÂ«
proper thing and the best paying Invest
ment, the owner of the property has as
yet given no indication of his intentions.
Market-street property Is receiving con
siderable attention these days, both from
would-be investors and owners desirous
of improving 'their holdings. In
this connection the March f number o j
the Real Estate Record, published by
G. H. Umbsen & Co.. says: It is be
coming apparent that the Interest In
upper Market street which was checked
by the period of dull times has revived.
Investment is once more taking p ace be
yond , the old Baldwin Hotel section and
Improvements in the way of new build
ings or in the renovation of old structures
are being pushed. The Ede purchase at
Market and Ninth streets, the Urge oulld
ing being erected by the Hale brothers
on the main thoroughfare near Sixth
street and the tearing down of the Wil
son buildings adjoining' ln order to make
place for a better class of construction
are among the marks, of the times. To
these may be added the Macdonough
building and the magnificent structure
contemplated by James L. i lood on the
former site of the Baldwin. Investment
and improvement are also making .them
selves apparent on streets contiguous to
Market street, as in the case of the pur
chase for construction by General Clunle
of the property on the southeast corner
of Golden Gate avenue and Leavenworth
street and the building up of the Callag
han estate gore on Market and McAllister
streets. It is a healthy sign when owners
Improve their property and when pur
chasers make investments for the sake of
construction. In the case of upper Mar
ket street it is to be regretted that the
changes under way in the splendid Barron
gore are not of substantial and liberal
order but apart from this and one or two
other exceptions the march- of progress
has again been taken -up In earnesv' â¢
According to Thomas Magee & Son s
Real Estate Circular, during I the past
month $1,763,143 was lent In all on city real
estate and $2,074,980 was released. "Of
these sums private lenders put out $481,
068 and released $932,373. The Hibernia
Bank lent $512,955 In February and released
$510 207- the German Bank lent |361,400 and
released $314,600: the Savings Union lent
$33 400 on city real estate and released
$o6!o<JO. It continues to be a marvel how
on an improved real e3tate market there
is no Increase of demand for money on
mortgage. "
"A loan of $157,000 was last month made
on the Odd Fellows' Hall property, south
corner of Seventh and Market streets, at
6^i per cent a year, the estate lending the
money paying the mortgage tax. This
year, with a tax rate for city and State
of $1 63 on each $100 of assessed value, the
net rate to the lender will be only 3.87 per
cent. On the tax rate of the previous
year, ?1 SO. it would only be $3 70., We hear
that one of our savings banks was willing
to take this loan at hVi per cent a year,
but it was too late in making the offer,
the agreement with the new lender hav
ing already been made at the reduced
rate. A reduction to B^i per cent a year
was not unexpected on large loans, be
cause of the fact that borrowers at 6 per
cent are simply not to be found."
The same publication has the following
of interest to builders:
"Before the close of 3S9S rough lumber
dropped to $14 and in the early part of
1899 it was raised to $17 and $18. At pres
ent rough lumber is $13 per thousand feet.
Building is very active In spite of the high

PRESIDENT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SAYS:
THE city has without doubt been injured greatly by the recent scare
created by the Board of Health. That commerce has suffered I will
not hesitate testate, because it is a reasonable conclusion that when
you blockade a portion of a city the interests and trade of that " city at
large must feel its destructive effects. I have been absent from San*
Francisco for a number of days, and since my return have not had an op
portunity to study the situation closely. I do not know yet to what ex

NEW WITNESS APPEARS
FOR MRS. CRAVEN-FAIR
Mrs. E. Roy Tells Grand Jury of a
Conversation She Had With
Simpton.
The attorneys for Mrs. Craven-Fair
played a trump card yesterday Â»n the
Grand Jury investigation by producing v*
witness in the person of Mrs. Elizabeth
Roy, who testified that former Justice
Simpton of Sausalito had Informed her
over four years ago that he knew some
thing about the marriage of Mrs. Craven
and Fair. Mrs. Roy said that in April,
ISS6. she was grand secretary of the Com
panions of the Forest, and on one occasion
Simpton came over from Sausalito to pay
over the per capita taxes collected from
the members of Bonita Circle, C. O. F., of
which he was then the financial secretary.
After the business had been concluded the
conversation drifted to the published re
ports in the newspapers regarding the
case of Mrs. Craven against the Fair
estate. Simpton. with a significant smile,
said:
"I know the woman who is after Fair'a
millions very well."
To this Mrs. Roy claims to have in
quired:
"Now, Mr. Simpton. do you think that
she was Fair's wife?
"Why." said Simpton. "I don't think so,
I know It and I could swear to it. You
know. I was a Justice of the Peace in
Sausalito, and you may bo sure tlm I
know something about Fair and Mrs. Cra

AFTER three days of theatrical pos
ing the San Francisco Board of
Health decided yesterday afternoon
to ring down the curtain on the
farce of its own making and slink
away from the stage before the carrots,
turnips and malodorous eggs of a justly
incensed public could reach its members.
First they would, and now they
wouldn't. With a blowing of horns they
set up a Quarantine of Chinatown be
cause a poor disease-eaten Chinese was
found in a cellar.
-The bubonic plague!" they cried In a
Eingle breath. "Let's tie up Chinatown
with rope, and for the benefit of science
ar.d our own public notoriety Practice
upon guinea-pigs, rats and other inoffen-
and the guinea
pigs inoculated. When this was done to
The satisfaction of all the members of the
Health Board they simply waited, haxing
Ixed a day for the limit of the small
beat's life* But the guinea-pig refused
to shuffle out of the world before the time
limit was reached and the members of the
Board of Health, becoming impatient at
the obstinacy of the animal, decided at
last to lift the quarantine. This was done
yesterday afternoon at a meeting of the
board, so Chinatown Is once again an
open door.
Experimenting With Germs.
From the very beginning of the farce
the Health Board has been consistently
inconsistent. Without having examined
Into the pre%-ious history of the case the
board physicians pronounced the cause of
death bubonic plague. Acting with a vir
tuous promptitude. Chinatown wa3 put
under an embargo at once. But the symp
toms of bubonic plague were not positive
enough lo satisfy the minds of the
learaed physicians, so they began experi
menting with bacilli, microbes, cultures
and other pet playthings of medical sci
ence declaring with one voice that their
judgment would have to lie in suspense
till Saturday or Sunday, at which time
the effect of the transplanted germs would
surely be shown. Seizing time by the
forelock, they called the deal oft a day in
advance.
Bubonic plague scares are no longer
treated as something to laugh at by the
public of San Francieco. Last year s
Board of Health took a fling at the sport
and was treated to an overflowing cup
of derision. The present allied band of
physicians labeled with Health Board au
thority was thirsting for notoriety and
something else. If scorn and contempt,
sneer and derision represent the former,
the members of that band have every
reason to be supremely happy.
Some rare juggling was indulged In at
the meeting yesterday afternoon. The
roll call showed the presence of Doctors
Williamson. Bazet. Baum, McCarthy and
Chief of Police Sullivan, who is an ex
offlcio member. Colonel Mendell. the
other member by virtue of his office, re
mained away. The tenor of the entire
meeting was apologetic and self-exculpa
torv â very much like the bad boy who
cried because the milk that was in the
pitcher was somewhere else after the
fall. A great deal of self-gratulatlon.
with a touch qf consolation thrown In
gratis, is shown in the speeches and the
resolutions.
Embargo Is Raised.
Dr McCarthy is responsible for the
lifting of the "blockade. The following
resolution introduced by him was unan
imously adopted:
Resolved. That the quarantine of the Chi
nese quarter now in effect be lifted on this
date at 4 o'clock p. in., providing that in the
meantime no further bulletins or Information
ar* received neceebltatini? its continuance, said
quarantine being subjected to re-establlshment
should future Investigation warrant.
Dr. "Williamson wished to gro on record
as saying that the Health Board did not
enter into the quarantine fiasco for
amusement either to the board or the
public at large, but for the purpose of
protecting the people of San Francisco.
At this time the board began to realize
that its dignity was offended, so the fol
lowing resolution was adopted, all be
ing an outgrowth of microblc revelry:
Resolved. That all Caucasian physicians at
'.endine cases in the Chinese quarter and
*mong Chinese be instructed to furnish clinical
histories of suspicious cases and also such
cases as may die while under their care, and
that the City Physician and his assistants and
the sanitary corps be instructed to make Â«.
house to house investigation of the Chinese
quarter with a view of determining the nature
of ailments from which Chinese under the care
of physicians of their own race may be suffer
ing, and to render complete reports to the
Board cf Health.
Then the board adjourned, no longer in
terested in barnyard stock.
Chinatown is breathing again with a
sense of restored freedom. Although the
quarantine was not rigidly enforced and
those who wished might go and come with
the exercise of a little ingenuity, the busi
ness men held celebrations last night be
cause the embargo was removed.

about the quarantine, and he voices the
sentiments of his people:
"Too much cannot be said In condemna

recently taken by the Board of Health.
The Interests of my countrymen were sac
rificed and the proceeding involved the
loss of thousands of dollars. I cannot un
derstand how such farces are tolerated,
and I sound the warning that should such
a thing ever be attempted again I will
make it a matter of international conse
quence in Justice to the people whose in

THE effects of the recent plague scare, and attendant quarantine have
been most serious. It would :be difficult for me to state the amount
of damage donef so great has it been, not only to trade, but to the
reputation of our city. Strangers have refrained from visiting us. and the
rumors, although they have been proved to have been without founda
tion, will, I fear, have a lasting effect. ;
I consider that the action of the Board of Health was altogether pre- .
mature. When; so much is at stake great care should be exercised before
creating scares and allowing impressions to go abroad that a dread disease
is possibly in our midst. A. A. WATKINS,
President Board of Trade.
â¢ * --â¢Â¦* ' Â¦ â¢. Â¦ , '
PRESIDENT MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION SfJYS:
THE plague scare/ as started by the Board of Health of this city, has
done irreparable iniurv to trade. It is to be deeply regretted that it
happened, and the extent to which merchants have suffered may
never be estimated. This is a time of the year when strangers are inclined
to visit this place, but thousands have been turned away by the plague
rumors and their money spent elsewhere. I hope that the newspapers
and trade organizations of the city will take action and^ explain the mis
take as clearly as possible, so that we may in part regain_ our standing
and recover a little of what we have lost. P. W. DOHB.MANN,
President Merchants' Association.
Y CONSIDER the action of the Board of
I Health aa one of very bad Judgment,
I â¢* considering the doubtful nature of the
Chinaman's death. It would have been
time enough to declare a condition of
plague when the result of the autopsy
had been ascertained beyond a doubt.
The people of this city may thank those
newspapers which pulled the scare mask
from their eyes and permitted them to
see the true Inwardness of the scheme to
extract money from the pocket* of tha
taxpayersâ nothing lees than to provide
soft . positions j for a horde of political
heelers. No man or body of- men hav
ing the Interests . of the city at heart
would wantonly cry "mad dog" where
there was no dog in sight. It was a
false alarm raised for an ignoble pur
pose. EDWARD L. CLAPP.
President San Francisco Labor Council.
WHAT the quarantine may do in
the next few days in affecting
travel here I can't say. The
only reason that it has not had
an effect thus far is that the
time has not been long enough for the
news to get abroad and be heard by the
traveling public.
In my opinion the action of the Board
of Health was hasty and ill-advised. Of
course 'if the board was certain that
bubonic plague existed it should have
acted, but not before it was certain.
Hysterical action such as that of the
last few days can never accomplish any
good, and may, do an Immense amount
of harm.
Th* manner in which The Call has
treated the whole matter from beginning
to end is worthy of the highest com
mendation. J. C. KIRKPATRICK,
Manager Palace Hotel.
warrant such proceedings ever existed
but grant that it had, discretion could
have been exercised and the city would
not have been made so severe a sufferer
"There was' no necessity of placing all
of the Chinese quarter in quarantine. An
embargo on the premises where the death
occurred would have been sufficient
Neither was there any excuse for alarm-
Ing the land with a plague cry, for an in
vestigation could have been conducted
quietly with just as satisfactory results.'"
