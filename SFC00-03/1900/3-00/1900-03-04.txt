A few years' ago the Klondike was the
place, to go, for there was gold thereâ it
was. saidâ by the ton. It Khone in the bot-

to the grasping worldâ XÂ«me, with all her
beach-laden wealth; a place of golden
s-ands where they handled the goJd with
scoop shovels. The Klondike was. for
gottenâforgotten by those who desired to
obtain wealth by scoop-shovel methods.
but not by those who were real, practical,
scientific miners, who'- knew that a great
deal that did not glitter was gold. These
men have stayed by the Klondike, and by
perseverance and new methoas have
brought about wonders "so great that cli
mate and geological conditionsâ nature's
handicapsâ have been overcome. J. E.
Doherty. the private secretary of Alexan
der McDonald, the mining king, has lately
returned from Dawson, and has much to
say regarding the conditions now present
in the Klondike and what the coming sea
son will bring forth. He is greatly inter
ested in the new process of thawing which
has been ir.aucurated and which enables
mining operations to be carried on the
year around. In ypeaking of things con
cerning the Yukon Mr. Doherty said:
The greatest drawback encountered
when the Klondike was opened up was
the difficulty of mining, arising from the
conditions above mentioned, and this,
added to the isolatlon'of the place, made
it hard indeed. Kvery one knows that the

In January. ICB. lhe Amv-rkens :n Texas declared war against Old Mexico
for the .independence of Texas. Along :n February tne war began in
earnest, and every day- we heard of .shootings by the Americans and
Mexicans. 1 v.as too frightened during those weeks to have a clear idea
of the order of event*., 1 remember, however, that w<Â» who knew nothing
of any part of the world outside of Mexico believed the Texans?' cause
hopelers. Would not Santa Anna and his big army come and annihilate
the ambitious and disorganized Texas men? we thought. 1 recall, aa if
it were >esttrday, how feiand aiid powerful General Santa Anna and hia
uniformed troops cf oWjQ men looked when they marched toward the pueblo
of San Antonio. . 'â¢>-;'. ..â¢:;.-
"Then Home one came and told me at my home that Colonel Travis.
Davy Crockett ami ColObel Jiowie and the squad of Americans who had
held that locality ajrainst the mother Government of Mexico for several
wfcfcs. had suddenly barricaded themselves in the old unused stone mis
sion khuich building on the approach of Santa Anna and his troops. Then
thp news came to our home 'that there was going to be an awful battle
between : that handfni pf Americans in the Alamo mission and Santa
Anna's armyâ the biygess. ana most powerful, po v.-c young people thought,
the world had ever sseen. That took place between the last day of Feb
ruary- and March 4.
*^bf crturhc. we were- hourly informed of the war r.ews. We knew
ihat the Texans in the Alamo were surrounded by 500 soldiers constantly
while -5500 more soldiers were in camp out on the plains. We learned that
four days had bren given the Texans to surrender. We heard from
the soldiers that the imprisoned men had not even so much as returned
a reply to ihiÂ» demand for surrender, and that on the morning of the 6th
Â«>f March. Santa Anna was going to bring matters to a crisis with the be
leaguered rebel*.
"Tiic mornins of Sunday, the Cth of Marchâ ahl/indecd, I could never

"Xext we saw that ladders were brought, and in a trice the low roof
of the church was crowded with the screaming; maddened throng of men
armed with suns and sabers. Of course we knew. then that it" wbb all up
with the little band of men In the Alamo. I remember, that Â¦, the priest
drew vi away from tho windows and. refused to ltt us look longer, not
withstanding the fascipation of the scene. , Â¦ ... ;
"We could hear the shouts -and yells, ar.d severnl; booms of the brass
cannon shook thq.prie3t's house and rattled the window-panes. '
; "Along about 9 o'clock, I should judge, the s-hooting and swearing and
yelling had ceased, but the air was thick and heavy with blue t>owder
smoke. A" Mexican coionel came running, to the priest's residence and
askedlhat-we ko down to the. Alamo to do what , we could for the dyinir
men. The colonel sai3, seml-contldenflally.' that in spite of the efforts of
the general and other officers the troops had given no quarter to the men
whom they had found still alive in the old church when the doors were
burst in; and that horrible scenes were instantly cnactr-d on every hand
The colonel assured us that he had, a guard, and that there 'would be no
danger to any of us, and that the services of the priest and of women
were never mor^ badly nteded. We snatched up all the linen and cotton
bedding we could find, and in the midst of a dozen soldiers we went to
the old stone mission. . ; Â¦ ..
"Such a dreadful "slffht! The roadway was thronged with : Mexican
soldiers.- with smoke and dirt-begrimed faces, haggard eyes and wild in
sane expression. There were twelve or fifteen bodies of Mexicans lyine
dead and bleeding here and there, and' others -were being carried to an

"The dead Tex#ns lay , singly and -in heaps or three ior .four or in

they had fallen when a ball reached a vital, part or they had dropped to
their death" from loss of blood. . Of. course we: went .to work as soon as
we got to the mission, at helping the blt*eding and moaning men who had
but a few hours at most of life. But in'the few:minutes:thafwe. looked
about the corpses all about us R.ive*a mind picture that has always been
as distinct as one before my very eyes. 1 So thick were the bodies of the
dead that we had to step over, some to get to a man in whom there wa*
stillUfe. Close to my feet was a young man who had been shot-through
the forehead/and who had dropped dead, with his eyes staring wildly open
as he seemingly gazed. up into. my. face..' A yard away. was a grizzled. old
Texan, whose beard and long,* unkempt hair were clotted with- blood that
trickled from- his mouth and ears. ,; Over there was a handsome young
man, whose determined resolution 'was shown in hls'corpse," for he died
grappling tight to a musket" in one : hand,- while ;he heldr a ramrod with
the other. He was in the act of loading* when shot down. Next to him
was a man whom I had partially known, : He had had business deals with
my husband, and death had evidently overtaken him as he was trying to
raise himself to his feet after he had been, wounded several times. ' I re
member . seeing poor old Colonel Davy ; Crockett; \ as ; he lay dead by the
side of a dying ! man .whose bloody and Â¦ powder-stained . fa.cc I . was wash
ing. Colonel Crockett was about 50 years old at that time.- His coat and
rough woolen ehirt were soaked, with blood so that the original color-was
hidden, for the eccantric hero must have died of some ball in the chest or
a -bayonet thrustsfrom the miserable.* low-lived cutthroats who swarmed
Into tho Alamo and spared not one of the Texans. . - ? â¢
I see ColonÂ«l Bowie dead? -No, but I remember his body was the
first laken from; the Alamo for burial, and that the priest said h* waa
as nne a gentleman as ever came to Texas. He was sick In the Alamo
bÂ«fora the fight, and hla face was thin -and pinched in death, and his eyes
were deep in their sccketi. The cot upon which he lay when be was killed
was drenched with blood. : â¢ -
;. " W Â» stayed with- the dying men until late that evening:, and- by that
time all-had expired but two young: men, named Lyon and Randall,- who
came rrom Louisiana. They were carried out under an umbrella tree, and
everything that could be done for their help was done. Eut they had tx*en
snot In the neck and chest and they died the next day in great agony.
When we tame to get the bodies ready for burial we found the wiUd of
many of the dead Texans in their pockets. Some were written on the
leaves or blank books, on used envelopes, and some on- thq inside of haver
sacks. - It all showed the preparation the men Inside the Alamo had mad*
tor death, and their determination to se.ll their lives as dearly as poÃsiblc."
-.The aged senora said that the only authentic knowledge of what took
pIMCC nmong theTexans in the Alamo, in getting ready for their battl*
with the, overpowering Mexican army, was gained from young Randall,
ono or the young men who lived until the 7th of. March. It wa3 he who
told how Colonel Travis had addressed the 173 men of Texas in the old
mission a few days before March 6. It was this young man who reported
how Colonel Travis told the intrepid men that all hope for rs^ef from th*
outside must be abandoned, that the army of Santa Anna, by which thÂ«y
were surrounded, numbered over 5000 men. and that to. surrender meant
savagery, and. perhaps, an. ignominious death. Young Randall, when
dying, related how Travis said coolly and calmly that he- himself- had de
cided to stay by the fort as long as he could move, and that he meant to
sell his life as dearly as possible to the Mexicans. Then how Travis with
his sword drew, a line across the church floor f rom â¢ wall to. WaHÂ» . and
stated that all who meant to stay by him in his determination TBlght
come over to that side of the line, while all who wished to. surrender to
Santa Anna might remain on the other side of the .line and would be at
once released:.. from the Alamo. It was this snrae young .Randall from
Louisiana who told with pride, even in excruciating pain from his wounds,
how every man in the,Texf>n band moved by a common impulse to the -side
of- the line with Colonel Travis, and therfby gave a token of their wish
to fight for their lives, with the tremendous odds -against them. It was
this same young man. Randall, who left for historians the only record they
ever had of the silent and prayerful preparations of the 17$ resolute men
in v the old stone mission to meet death. as patriots, and to fight for thÂ»
independence of Texas as long as physical strength was given them. Â¦

ting through this moss was no easy matter and. required two
men thirty days to make the excavation, which is generally
dug six feet long and two wide. The pay dirt is alwaya
found in a frozen condition and has to be thawed; before
the. gravel, can be sluiced. The early method of . thaw-
Ing, and one, which Is employed now to some extent, was
. a simple wood fire built at the bottom of the excavation.
It can be readily seen that even the matter of pfospect
k ins: would entail nollttle expense, as two men for thirty
days, at $10 per day each, would cost a pretty sum.

W^\,^^^^^^ " By the introduction of the new pro-
cess, steam thawing, sluicing is not
only reads possible the year around, but
the cost cf production is lessened and a.
great deal more may be accomplished
with the same amount of time, .labor and
capital. ..'._' . ' â¢
This new method is the invention of Mf.
Stiles, who haY been in the employ of Mr.
Alexander McDonald, the' Klondike kintr,
for a number of years. Mr. McDonald wis
the first^. ta"-;use/ the new process, and
since a great-- many miners
have-Vtaken it up. The method is quite
simple and" is easiljvput into operation at
a comparatively small cost. â¢A steam
boiler ;isÂ». placed upon the surface and a
shed built abdve it- as a.protection againnt
trie'weather. From the boiler, which nvw
be of any size,' according to the magni
tude of the operations. pipes--radiate, and
lead down the 'main shaft, which is cut as
the thawing progresses, until the gravel
bed. is reached, and then a tunnel is cut
at right angles . gome 400 to 500 feet in
length. Down the shaft and through the
tunnel a three-inch pipe Is run, which
carries the steam from the boiler above on
the surface. To the end of this pipe ?3
attached a rubber hose especially made
for the conveyance of steamâ this ose
branches out into eight or ten smaller
tubes, each of which has attached at the
end an iron screw, wedge or point. These
points are driven into the frosen gravel or
moss; the "steam S3 -turned on and the
surface, there to be run -through . the.
sluice bc^es. In these, tunnels and Â«haftÂ«
no timbering* Is required, as the' decayed
vegetation Is frozen so solid that there
is not the wllc-htest chance, of. a' slide.
However, after, thawing, some of turn
| mofs becomes loose -and falls away, but
as the miners, work 'backward the fallen
material does not crt off the exit. The
tunnel is dug and then, coramencinit: at
the end, the dirt above, below and at the
sides, 13 taken from' the extreme end first.
'Â¦ to that, as the miners work, enlarging
the tunnel all the time; the earth which
falls In occupies a space already gone
over by the miner?. With the attendant
heat, of â c steam and the length" of the
tunnel the air becomes scarce and foul.
To avoid this air is supplied through a
sepa.rate shaft dug from the 'surface
down to the tunnel and rising perpendicu
lar to it. , . . *Â¦â¢â¢
Â¦ . A ten-horsepower boiler will; run eight
â¢ or. ten points, or nozzles, and .will thaw
ten times as much' as the ordinary wood
lire. The process is as cheap- as wood,
the fuel used is closÂ«i jat hand, all that is
necessary to obtain it being the cutting..
Quicksilver Is used very- little in these
placer mines. The sluice boxes arc mad *
long and narrow.. with the ripples placed
in the bottom of the boxes, running pa
rallel. These ripples are made of two
inch scantling and to prevent the wear
and tear of the. water and era vel they
are covered with sheetlron. They are sÂ«t
two inches apart and are blocked at each
end to prevent the gold from running out.
Conditions have changed at Dawson
within the past few months and . thera
has been a great ;reduction in prices, both
for labor and supplies, the reduction be
ing brought about mainly, through in
creased transportation facilities and th*
good effects' of competition. And then
again, the newness of the Klondike has
worn off. It is no. longer a venture. It
is a certainty. It has lost its excitement
and has settled down into a' position of
evenness and advancement. Â¦'â¢ '.'<Â¦ .{: -
Though the Mohammedans in London number.no more than 200. they
are building 1 a mosque, at a cost of J30.000. to accommodate from 300 to

New Metropo-iC MWB
Musgrave raised- his chair and set it down "again one
ihch'necrrr his visitor.. .:\
"Captain." he said in an undertone. "I suppose you
know that .it's all up with the company?"
"Weil. 1 fruessed thzt things weren't over brisk."
-"Bri'k! They're brisk enough, but it's the wrong
Â»'Â»y. We are in â¢ liquidation. The boats arc to tn
:-old and in a few day's the North Brazilian will have
. I:o. further Tisc for your valuable services or mine."
"Humph! that's bad!"
"â¢'â¢ "Bad as it can be as regards the company. That's
why I wanted you to come and talk things over."
;.Thc captain shot' : an inquiring glance at Musgrave.
. "I've an idea that will yield a few thousand pounds
within twelve months," Musgrave went on. "I wan:
a captain to go in with me on haft shares.'*
"What is it?" came the sharp inquiry.
"Take a solemn oath that you won't divulge and T'A
toll you everything." SbfiS
"Oh. that's all right: you can trust me."
"Give me your hand."
Th.c captain's .arm s-lowly rose.
Musgrave grasped his hand and held it- firmly.
"Give me your solemn oath that you won't repeat a
word that I say to any one." â¢
. "Right. I sw.ear." â¢
' "Good. Then here's the -trick. I'm going to bluff
tij.? underwriters. I've paid them thousands, and it's
quite time I made a call on them."
. Hermann looked back and moved uneasily.
"You needn't beafraid: it's not a scuttling job. We
can <!o better than that," said Musgrave, reading the
captpin'.s thoughts.
] "Go-.0n," was the impatient rejoinder.
I VWe can get one of the company's boats at our own
price., Suppose we take one of the best, fill her up with
what we can get or with rubbish; insure the ship .an i
rwrgafor a top sum, and let her go and play chameleon

"Ycs^: th?.t you want -to send me to penal servitude?"

"Bosh ! â¢ Don't you see the play. .Twenty-four hours
out your boat becomes some other boat. You paint her
dc.vr. and give her the name of some boat she's like.
Musgrave collected enough cargo to give a look of
genuine freight and business to the boat while she wways y
loading, and Captain Hermann helped to make draught
by taking all of the water he safely could into con
venient parts of her. Except for appearance, on insur
ance account, they wanted no cargo. Every ton put on
board was an incumbrancc and added to the risks of
the undertaking.
When the Madeline steamed easily down the Thames,
bound nominally for. Rio Janeiro, she had every appear
ance lof being as well found and honest -a trading
steamer as ever carried a. house flag. But the piece of:
deep -'Llue â¢Â¦bunting bearing the large yellow M; which
fluttered at her maiy truck and : her freshly painted fun

colored body, bearing *afclÂ«ar: arid evasive letter M on
each sideâ standing tor Madeline or "'MusÂ»rrayeâwere^
new and caused' many a speculation as to whose the
steamer might be.
Hermann knew, his business as well as any man who
ever paced a steamer's bridge, and knew just as well ho'v
to get any work connected .with his steamer done by the
time and in .the way he -wanted. When therefore the
Madeline had been six days out she had become another
craft. ; Her funnel was: dark blue with :a: single' black
band at the top>. Her hull .was glossy black 'with ;a
good breadth of biight salmon pink curving away above
the water line. At each side of the , bb'vy% â¢in Â¦ large yel
low; letters stood out. the) name of Sicilian and on
the sweep of the stern; were neatly picked out the words,
Sicilian, London. ; ~ii -, '.
"Wonder if;' Musgrave would know .us if he came
alongside now," "chuckled Hermann to his second oi â¢'
ficer ' as they 'stood on : the- bridge \watching 'Â¦-. a couple

Â¦ Instead of ; steaming . yv'est Â¦ for ; RioTthe " Sicilian ' took Â¦ a

Rio on that â¢ trip. Musgrave had made '< up such papers'
as Hermann would require and had Riven them tohim
with letters j of ; consignment â¢to two 'j Colombo ' aeencies.

Hermann sat silent, looking hard at the fireback.
The scheme was as audacious as it .was simple, but he
saw difficulties. There were the cargo, and the papers
and the crew. The cargo would have to be got rid of
and the crew would see all that was done above board.
"Won't it work?" asked Musgrave, - di^jppointed.
Hermann shook his head. ;'lv ;'
"Why not?"
"What about the cargo and the papers and the men?"
queried the captain.
"I'll see to the papers. The cargo, you'd put out
where we'd arranged, and you would have to keep the
men on board until you had got rid of the boat." said
Musgrave confidently. ;
Hermann thought again: ' :'..';
"What would a boat fetch at Calcutta or Bombay?"
he asked after a long think. SllP^
-""More than the cost of the venture." "v
"And how much Â¦ would you make out of the insur-
''Can't tell: perhaps thirty thousand; perhaps more."
"And would you be willing to make it an equal 'share
"Yes, v.c would divide equally." , . . â¢
"How about petting a boat?"
"I can work th3t. The company will be glad to get a

Hermann, took a sip at his whisky, and then thought
for a minute. "Pay all costs and guarantee me isooii
however the thing goes and I'll go in vnth.you," he said
decisively.
'Â¦ "Why Â£2000?" Musgravc asked with a disappointed
Â«ir.
"Because I take the risks. If the thing! fails I'm
done." â¢
"Tut! nonsense!" , . '
"Ruined, ruined! Nothing'but penal servitude for it,"
the captain said emphatically.
They talked for ten minutes more and -then Mus
grave yielded." The captain agreed to join him in the
venture oh the understanding that he was to 'have -half,
of the net profits, or Â£2000, whichever sum might be
the greater. He was to command such steamer as could
be got and jointly withMusgrave was to exploit the un
derwriters. The cool effrontery. of, the project made it
the more lighter and more attractive to" him.. He parted
from Musgrave . in a lighter and more hopeful Â¦ mood
than -he had known for many a day.
Musgrave bought; the North 'Brazilian Company's
steamer Madeline at a price, which some of the share
holders .of the company correctly described. as ."little
more than the price of old iron." But as the company
had been working at a ruinous loss and was retiring
Henry/ Musgrave, -its old manager, to make way for a
liquidator, and as the Madeline and two other steamers
were swallowing up the, little remaining capital of the
company, the directors were glad of an opportunity <of

Charlie Danson and -Joe Gregory stepped into ..the
boat and she was pushed off. The four oars dipped and
she shot quietly through the still water. 'â¢ -.' - :Â¦" '..Â¦"
Hermann stood on the quay red with rage.: He would [\
have hailed the boat and brought her back, but some
how he dared not. One of the three, strangers who had
gone in her was evidently, a captain, and the other two
were officers. It wotrlvi have looked bad to bring the
boat back. And one of the three was suspicious as 'it-.
.was. Reproaching himself-for his folly in .telling 'this '
man to go in his own boat'and see. the ship', he walked .
to and fro along the quay, a strange feeling of impend
ing mischief creeping over him. . ' . 'â¢;. [ {

up to the bow of the steamer. "S-i-c-i : l-i-a-n! Isn't that j,

In half a minute Dick Fairburn stood on the deck of;

and Charlie Danson stood beside him. The deckhands
came around, looked at the strange officers and ex- i
changed glances. . " 'â¢ - - '. - ' : . .;'Â¦'
"It's all "rfght, men.. Your captain sent us aboard;' :

"Come on. captain, and you, Mr. Danson^ this.way."
Dick Fairburn walked toward the midship deckhouse,
the other two and some- of the ship's hands following.
Enterins the starboard alleyway,- he walked on until he
reached the fourth door on the port hand. There was a
little plate bearing the words "First. Officer" over the
door. Dick grasped. the handle; turned it and gave a
push. The door opened inward. A coat hung from a
rail and other articles lay about. Across the narrow end
of the room *here was a short seat. â¢ ; X .
Dick Fairburn entered the room and walked to tha
seat and sat down. Joe. Gregory and Charlie Danson
followed him mi .Â¦â¢'.'. f Â¦ # ..
"For nearly three years this" was my room," said Dick.
"When I got sweet on Madeline. Musgrave I thought I
would 1 like to have her. name before me when I was sit
ting in here. So I did this: see."- "- . .â¢... / \
He stepped to the other end of the room and placed
one hand upon each edge of a raised panel on the space
by v the door. With a light upward jerk the. panel came Â¦
away in his hands. On the woodwork whichlhe panel,
had covered was carved the . word "Madeline" in clear

"There! I carved that when I- was first officer of th:Â»

replacing the panel on the little 1 concealed hook which
supported it and hid the revered name from'an idle gaze.
. Dick led the way from the room, pushed through the
men who now thronged the allejrway, and made for the
ladder. The boat was stiU alongside. ' . .

and had been taking a few turns on' the bifndar- before
parting for the night." ,-*-'â¢ Â¦
Suddenly Dick became silent and looked intently at a
steamer with a blue funnel and black smokestack lying
out in the harbor.
"What's .up, Dick?" said Joe Gregory, seeing that
something had taken his old comrade's attention.
"I'd bet six months' pay that that's my old ship," said
Dick, pointing to the steamer.
"That's; the Sicilian, a London boat; I saw her name
*s we came ashore," said Gregory. â¢'
"It's' the Madeline if the Madeline's afloat. I ought"
to know her," Dick said dogmatically.
["â¢Well, what does it matter?" . Â¦ .
Dick turned to Gregory with a queer, sheepish smile
which changed in an instant to a look of furious wrath.
,: "What in heaven's name's. up, Dick?" said Gregory,
struck by the change which had come over his old mate.
' The look of anger melted and the look of sheepish
confusion came back to the face of Dick Fairburn. He
stood like some school boy who had been the victim of a
mean trick and knew it. .
"Queer that we should meet here at Bombay,. Joe,
after so long and this thing crop up," he said; with
feeling. "You'll say I'm a fool, but I don't mind tellinj?
you," he added as he stopped and looked down at his
boots. /
"Go on, man," said Gregory, impatient. ...
Pick looked up again. He was red as the setting sun
on a wild March day. ; ' .',' 'â¢ - .
. - "Five years ago," he began unsteadily. "I joined
that boat as 'second.' She belonged to a new company,
the North Brazilian Shipping Company.; The manager
was named Henry Musgrave. He used often to come
on the boat and would bring his wife and daughter and
others to see her. Once he went-with us to Montevideo,
and took his. daughter. I was 'first' then. She. was the
jolliest girl I ever met. She was interested in every
thing about the shipand Ihad to tell her all aboutthe
compasses and the navigation. And, by heaven, before
we got back to Londonâ they came back with vs â that
girl was dead gone oh meâ"
"And you?" interrupted Gregory.
"Was deader gone on her. Ton ray life, I couldn't
help it. Joe; she was such a merry lass, you would have
fallen in love with her yourself."
"What was her name?"
"MadelineâMadeline Musgrave.; The ship was called
after her." Â¦ .- â¢'
"Why didn't you marry her?" asked Gregory, laugh-
4
lightening their burdens by disposing of one of 'the
steamers. And to take the grace of a virtue out of what
was almost a necessity, some of the shareholders' viewed
their retiring manager with condescension and said:
"Give him a chance: let him have the boat to see what he
can do for himself." Â¦ . r .
So Musgrave got the Madeline, a handy, modern boat
of over 2500 tons, named after his only daughter as a
compliment to him five years before.

THIS Is the story of a little girl who paid for her own edu
cation. - Her capital was seven lambs.
Laura Chalmers was just eight years old when she
started out to be a shepherdess. She was living at 611
ver Creek, up in the mountains of Alpine County, when
â¢lie arrived at the decision.. and Alpine County Is an appropri
ate place In which to be a shepherdess.
When her eighth birthday came she put on a pair of over
alls, a blue and white checked sunbonnet and a solemn face.
Her black curls would tumble down under the sunbonnet and
would look undignified in spite of all she could dc> But she
made herself as stern as possible and called her lambs together.
"Lambs, I have something of importance }.o communicate
to you," she said. She had learned the phrase in a big gilt-edged
bock that stood on the whatnot. .
â¢ With her lambs gathered about her and seeming to listen
the told them a long story as if they understood. She was only
a little girl, but ehe knew the story well enough herself, though
it was the kind that Is usually read only in the grown people's
botik of "life. She told how poor her mother was, now that the
mine in which her father's fortune had been sunk was no longer
tÂ«elng worked. . How they themselves, the lambs, had been
given the little girl by sheep men # who now and "then passed
Uure on the way to grazing land. How they were all her very
own. tfÂ» do as sh<? pleased with, and how she had decided to call
them lur flock and go Into sheep raising. . .
"You .wouldn't have to work, poor lambs, if papa was still
alive," she apologized to them. It was little enough they knew
about work, to be suro. They were frisky and fluffy with youth
â r/o friskier than Laura might have been except for the great
trouble which had made her much older than tight years.
There had been aUime when Chalmers" mine at Silver .Creek
Â¦was keeping the whole place humming" with the excitement of
its prosperity. . Then the crash had come. If the- lambs; had
been able to look back upon all these changes .they might have
done some moralizing on their own account, but they were very
Â¦ycting. I â¢,*'â¢. --. " Â¦ ' * ; '. -'
So -, they simply put their shoulders "to / the wheel without

Place Where Prayer Never Ceases.
There Is one spot in the United States
where the voice of prayer 13 never still.
For more than twenty months the "turret
of prayer" that surrounds the "Temple

never for an Instant been without the
sound of a human voice in supplication.
It is the intention of the people who at
tend to this remarkable form of worship
that prayer in the turret shall never cease
so long as the building shall stand.
-The author of this custom is the Rev.
Frank TV. Sandford, leader of the "Holy
Ghost and Us Society." The society af

in a few years achieved such success that
it ha 3 built four buildings, the "Temple
of Truth" among, them, . which form a
rectangle capable, of seating 20,000 persons.
The life here Is quite- in the spirit of a
religious revival. Conversions are made,
and.tha slcktaealed by prayer every day
in the year. .The students of religion who

The sheep were all of Laura's companions. Sometimes - a

Ter Creek for a day or two, but these strangers were always so
disobliging as to bÂ« grown up and therefore very uncompanion
able. Laura did not know what a real boy or girl was. She had
speculations on the subject, based upon herself, but self is a
risky basis. BhbESPSSv^I
As time went by Mrs. Chalmers did a great deal of thinking.
This thinking was about Laura and school. It would never do

a pile of sheep money laid away for. a rainy day. 'â¢&â¢â¢': . -

have talked with men who used to hunt
egrets and herons in the marsh lands and
bays of Peru, the United States of Colom
bia and Ecuador for the Paris and other
European markets, and they tell me that
the birds have been so thoroughly wiped
out down that way that it Is a loss of
time and money to try to get a living by
hunting egrets and herons. A millinery
feather-buyer from Paris who came down
to the City of Mexico last January told
me that he will never come out this way
any more to buy feathers, for there were
so few good plumes to be had that it wa<j
a losing proposition for him. He said that
his firm In Paris was going to turn Its at
tention to peeking Its ornamental feather
supply in Africa, but that it was by no
means certain that It could get egret
plumes in that part of the world. The
house he was with in Paris used to buy
$23,000 worth of egret feathers In Mexico,
Central America and' Peru every year. So
you can see how the business on this con
tinent haÂ« diminished.

I had four good shooters at work for me
among the lagoons of Nicaragua.: I got
about $6000 that year clear after seven
months' work. I cold the whole feather
crop to a buyer from Brussels, Belgium,
that year and he paid me $30 an ounce
for my finest plumes.
"Only a very few feathers are available
on the egret. On the heron there are
three times as many, but heron feathen
by apparently honest saleswomen for gen

Madison avenues in New York, and It Is
seldom that I have seen first-class egret
plumes worn. I know, too that many of
the fashionable women whom I passed
thought they were wearing the best
egrets.
"You want to hear about how we hunt
egrets and herons? Well, we have to live
sn the outskirts of civilization when we
have canned foods and metal boxes for
our feathers and our ammunition in the
boats with us. We use the best shotguns
and No. 5 shot, which does effective work
without mangling the birds. An egret
hunter must be the foxiest kind of a
hunter.
"Talk about the artifice and skill of
duck or squirrel hunting! Why, both are
boy's play by the side of shooting, egrets
or herons for a living. These birds are
the most cautious and wary of any I have
ever known or heard of. I have known
herons to even desert a whole nest of
young because they- saw an old hat lying
near the reeds where the nejst had been
made and their suspicion* were thereby
roused. Egrets seem to almost smell the
presence of a man with a gun. I knotv
of no decoy that could be used for egrets

used that would be the last of that trick
In that locality, for by some sort of Free
masonry all the bird's family and cousins
for miles around would be warned of the
delusion.' .

much a plume and so much for smaller
and discolored feathers. The Parisian
milliners, who. rule the ornamental
feather market of the world and make and
unmake all the fashions and create de
mands in our line of business, began to
buy egret and lueron feathers by the
ounce, and that practice was quickly fol
lowed by the New York and Philadelphia
ornamental- feather dealers. Under tho
McKlnley tariff law there was a duty of
10 per cent ad valorem on all my egret
feathers sent to New York, but now they
are admitted free of duty, and we hunters
get the 10 per cent difference. The price
for my feathers depends upon the con
dition of my stock and the manner and
place In which I market it. I have to take
reveral things into consideration in selling
a season's shooting of some $3000 or $1000
worth of egret feathers.
"If I >ro to the. City of Mexico and wait
for a buyer from Paris I may get $24 an
ounce for plumes and $9 an ounce for
"srret feathers. If I send the stock to
New York or San Francisco I sret $28 an
ounce for my plumes. If I am dealt with
fairly, ar.d from Sf* to $11 for the common
feathers. Years ago I used to have some

v.-holeÂ»a!e feather dealers of New York,
but now that I have learned to know
my men and have made a reputation for
ray Â¦wares I seldom *et cheated. Tn 18S4

are worth less than half as much as egret
feathers. Tho experienced feather buy
ers know the. difference at a glance, and
many feet away, too. It Is useless to mix
heron and egret feathers together and try
to palm them oft on a buyer that knows
his business. A full-grown. egret will yield
about one-fourth of an ounce of feathers
and one-sixth of an ounce of plumes.
None of the other fenthera are touched,
and it takes much experience for a hunter
to know lust what will be marketable. All
the available egret plumes* are on the
bird's back. Just back of the tall, but the
heron nas marketable feathers on both
the back and the breast. We ' generally
reckon that an egret that la got without
damage to the feathers is worth about
$3 20 and each heron $135. Although- the
wholesale feather buyers are wonderfully
exacting and: share with the hunters -as
to. the different prices for the egret and
heron feathers, there Is almost universal
deception of the consumers and the gen
eral public. on these points. I have been
In first-elaas millinery stores in San Fran
cisco, New York and -other cities, and
have seen heron feathers and plumes sold
. go after these birds. For days and nights
at a time we make our home In little row
boats. I built canoe shape for fast t ravel
. Ing, and we lived among the marshes and
reeds of the lagoons and bays; under a
fierce. semi-tropic sky. It is the hardest
sort of life, and no one, however robust,
could keep It up for more than a few
months at a, time. The miasma of the
.water, and 4 . the 'poisonous atmosphere all
about us at night soon fills one's blood
with rheumatism" and fevers. We hunters
take our potion of quinine and whisky at
regular Intervals several times a day. We
' Â«ren for an hour. "We get our birds
either at early evening or at the first
break of day. We seldom get birds at
evening and then at the following dawn,
for at the report of a gun every egret or
heron: in the region flies 'straight away
and will not come back to that_partlcular
spot for four or live days. Even then
they return with wonderful caution. So
we move from one part of a bay or lagoon
-at midday, when the birds are off feeding
at. the shoals along tho shore. We get
our craft in position, one man In a boat,
before 4 p. m., and conceal ourselves
with reeds and foliage, just as Â¦ duck
hunters do. Along about 5 or 6 o'clock
the birds come back to their nests and
camping grounds. . Then we . watch our
opportunity for shots, and by long expe
rience I have learned Â¦ perfectly when it
comes. Just at the proper moment I will
shoot, and in a fraction of a second my
hired shooters will follow with their
guns. Generally I; can get three or four
successful shots at the frightened birds
before they are out of range, for they are
so easiiv frightened that they are power
less of flight for a moment and make good
targets of themselves. Sometimes we get
aa many as fifteen birds at one evening's
shooting, but moro . often . the number Is
seven or eight. Years ago. when egrets
and herons were very plentiful in Central

from, discolored water or the stain of
weeda - 4V Ever y -week we have to throw
away, the carcass of an egret or heron
.because the' feathers or plumes are. blood
stained or twisted out of shapeâ¢
"After we have got our birds and have
picked the few feathers we want from
; each, we plan. another onslaught In an
other locality. If we are lucky we may
soon get located four or five miles away
'amid reeds and- foliage under covert of
darkness, so as to be ready . for more
shooting the next morning.* . We -row
about with rare caution, we seldom apeak
ln.loud tones, and we do not even smoke
when we are hunting, because of tne
extraordinary wariness of . the birds!
Many a time I, have lain in one position
for hours beneath my little roof of tulee
and rushes, because I saw that a flock
usually measure four feet -from bill to
tip of the tall. Their expanse of wings la
often seven feet, and they stand about
forty Inches high. Their weight la from
three to four pounds. The hunting sea
son for both egrets and herons begins In
February and closes In September. It Is
now at Its : very heisht. and I shall go
back down the coast In a few days to
resume shooting operations. After Au
gust the feathers of- herons and egrets
become coarse and hard and are in no
demand In the best markets. Both vari
eties of the birds are as white as snow so
far as I have ever seen.' but people from
Peru and Argentine Republic say they
have seen blue and red and even black
herons. Herons are slow of flight, and
like the cranes that are known all over
the world, they have a very graceful
dignified way of drawing their attenu
ated legs up under them and sailing away
to lofty eminences by an occasional flap
of their wings. The egretd are more fussy
and nervous* creatures. Â¦ They are as
watchful as weasels, although one who
sees them for the first time would b*
v f ry Â«^ ap . t .,' to tnlnk e &ret3 dumb and
stupid, like ostriches. Both herons and
egrets feed on small, fish, frogs, and In
fects that they find close inshore. where
the birds may wade about in the marsh
and pick up their victims at will. The
egret s feathers are much more beautiful
and delicate than the heron's. All egret
plumes come from the back, and they
droop gracefully over the tail of the bird.
The heron prefers to make a nest in the
top of some tree along the edge of a bay
or a lagoon, or particularly on the upper
most part of a rock or promontory that
may rear itself up from an inland bay.
tgrets make nests among driftwood or
in a dry spot among rushes, accumulated
seaweed or brush in a lagoon as far from
shore as possible. Â¦ Both varieties of birds
make nests of sticks and large twigs, and
both have been known to keep their
nests for several years at a time, al
though I myself have never been able to
observe that point because my advent in
a colony of the crane family means war
and death In short order. Egrets usually
lay six eggs and herons four. The ergs
or both are of a sea green hue. "A heron
doea not have its best feathers until It Is
ten months old. and the* plumes of an
egret are not worth |CS an ounce until
the bird is over a year old."

the .latest years of the life of Goethe and
those of :Herbert Spencer. Goethe died at
83, and spent the last three years of his
life in revising and giving the final
touches to a complete edition of his own
works. Herbert Spencer Is now 80, and
since the publication of his last volume,
over two years. ago. has devoted his time
to making Tsuch changes in'hla writings
as will conform . them to the discoveries
and advancement of -scientific research
made.inahe years intervening since the
publication of his volumes. Few men have
been permitted so fully, to round off and
complete a- literary career. Generally the
work of an author, like that of most other
men, is cut short: by, death, and that
writer^is singularly. fortunate who is able
in. the .maturity of his experience to give
his works that 'form in which he desires

this fact alone gives a most fairy

short story "of early Illinois life. Abra
ham Lincoln and Richard Yates, after
ward War Governor of Illinois, appear as
the defenders! and protectors of a young
Spanish girl, who has been adopted by an
old Indian.' Even within the brief Ilmlt3
of the little book room is found for, vivid
dramatic realization of a large number of
characters. The purpose of the book is in
large part to give a picture of the whole
pome, rough, and heroic life of "Young
Illinois"; in part to give a view of Lin
coln displaying his great tender nature
even in youth. The book appears to rest
on some historical basis. It would have
been a" kindness to have -informed the
reader just how complete this basis is. It
Is certainly a skillful story; but it might
be maintained that it is too romantic
either as history or as a setting for the
heroic personalities which appear in It

tlon and . political machinations will be
the principal elements â the outcome of
the bitter enmity between the two indi
viduals. Daly cannot reconcile himself to
his --enemy's success, and nothing would
persuade him to let him enjoy It in peace.
"I don't like him, nohow," Daly is
quoted. â¢ "He ain't rightâ he. ain't rightâ
I don't like him; nohow." That is the sum
total of his reasons for his, vituperations.
The two. have been battling over copper
of late years, and the vast copper trust of
3899, .under Clark's control, was waged
against by the mighty influence, of the
Standard Oil Trust, at whose wheel Daly
is installed.
In appearance the two men differ vastly.
Clark is slender, elegant and. cultured in
appearance." He takes great Interest in
art and curios, and his family have been
Eent to France and Germany, where they
have been educated in the languages of
the Continent. He has an enviable collec
tion of paintings, rare tapestries j and
artistic et ceteras. His appearance is sug
gestive of the clubman and the traveler.
Daly, on the other hand. Is not at all"
fastidious in matters of dress, the plain
est'of business suits sufficing for all oc-
ness affairs. And, finally, both ara alike
In their cordial hate of each other.
They are both growing old. Clark Is
60, though he looks oply 50, and Daly Is
three years younger. With the coming of
old ago there has been no slackening of
their antagonism, and; there,- is not the
slightest likelihood of a decrease in their
cordial hate for each other, from the
standpoint of twenty years of enmity.
They are waging their battles in the
United States Senate at present. With the
persistence and tenacity of his bulldog
nature Daly is attacking Clark's qualifi
cations, and the outcome Is not yet at
hand. , "% :*>

"How long has that ship been the Sici

when they were close to the landing.
"This voyage," answered the mate,
without thinking.
"There you are. What about the five
sovereigns?" said Dick, with a laugh, to
Charlie Dansan.'
"Here, take them." replied Charlie, as
his hand slid to his pocket. - â¢ . â¢ w

In looking over the first Â¦ newspaper
which came into his hand ; after thÂ«
Leonldas reached London Dick Falrburn's
eye fell upon a list of missing vessels.
Fourth In the list was the name of the
Madeline of London; owner, Henry. .Mm-.
grave. . .
Like a lightning flash the troth about
the Sicilian broke upon Dick's mind." He
knew the Madeline was not lost, though
missing under, her old name unquestion
ably she was. He had left her out then*
at Bombay, safe and sound and known as
the Sicilian. -He saw that a, rascally
game was being played and that tha
prime moVer In it was' Henry Musgrave,
the man who scorned him when he had
loved his daughter and she had loved him
In return.
Dick Fairburn's first , Impulse was to
take a cab for Bow utreet or the under
writers' and inform them that the Made
line was afjoat. all taut and trim. Then
a thought checked him. If he did that
Musgrave would be prosecuted and ruin
ed, and then what would became of the
girl he loved. He might marry her, truly;
but he would be marrying- a felon's
daughter. - No. that would not do. ' â¢ "
Early on the" following morning Dick
Fairburn was ushered Into Henry Mus
grave's private room. He waited pa
tiently until the owner of the Madeline
thought proper to give him an audience.
"Well, what's your business?" said
Musgrave. curtly, as he recognized the
old' first officer of the Madeline.

Musgrave was dumfounded. His face â¢

went. At last he broke down utterly.-.

THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT CLARK-DALY FEUD
ual fusillade of political bullets, and now
Clark In turn repaid them wlth= Interest.
As a consequence the fight for the site of
the Montana capital Is one of the blackest
pages of Northwestern history. Boiled
down and simmered to direct issue, it
narrowed to a fight between two men, a
personal conflict, and a venting of private
spleen. When Clark came out victor he
was a hero in the eyes of the people. He
was escorted through the city In 'a car
riage magnificently decked with ; floweret
the horses having been taken away and
prominent citizens substituted In their
places. k '
For a few years after this culmination
of enmity It seemed that the feud had
been abated. Each contestant had retired
from the fight, apparently satisfied for
the time being. In IS9B, however, the old
storm again broke loose over State poli
tics.
' The unscrupulous use of money, and lots
of it, and the machinations of politicians,
reached a disgraceful climax. The scan-
election of the. Senators for the Legisla
ture,of the new State. Clark was a can
didate from a district that was In a curi
ous muddle, which enabled both political
parties to nominate a prospective Sena
tor. Daly managed the affair so that the
district was unable to settle its contro
versy and the decision was left to a Re-,
publican United States Senate. Of course,
Clark was not seated. Tiiey did not ap
proach Daly for further compromises.
The two nren ever since have thrown
their "vast resources against each other â
the powerful sway of the political con
trol of laboring men, their Interest in
the welfare of cities where their capital
was invested, their personal and business
friendships, their social and political
standing. ! It became an essential of every
resident of Montana to be enlisted on onÂ©
side or the other, and those who went into
the State with the intention of remaining
neutral either had to leave it or give '.up
their intention. The attitude of all new
comers was canvassed and centralized' to
Dalyistn 'or Clarkism as assiduously as
was the favor of the older residents mar
shaled or their. enmity made uncomfort
able. So. bitter was the spirit between the
two factions that all social intercourse
was avoided, a^id did a disciple, of one
party get over the established traces so
far as to entertain in any way one of the
other party the offender was absolutely
certain of financial and business .ruin.
Daly was so enthusiastic In this partic
ular matter that it is said he removed ono
of the employes of a banking institution
in which he was interested from Butta 1
the fact that he was not slow to match
each act of his adversary, not always
with retaliations which are in accordance
with the code of ethics.
In the question of a selection of the
capital city of the new State the two
enemies -found a fresh and lively bone of
contention. Helena was championed' by
Clark and Daly selected Anaconda as his
center of opposition.' , ; Clark has a* vast
incomeâ estimated as one million a month.
Daly had less capital, but a fertile brain
'and an unparalleled shrewdness."The-bat
tle meant much to both/'. If Anaconda
won Daly would Irrevocably become the
master of the destinies of Montana. The
thousands of men In the employ of his
mines there would form the balance; of
power.ln all matters of moment. â¢" It was
much the same with /. Clark and j hUi
Helena. The advantage of capital ' swayed
the battle in Clark's favor and It is said
that, the determined ( lrishman made i use
of trie last resortâhe went to Clark with
the offer of a guarantee for the Sena
torial nomination if Clark | would throw
his influence ' in behalf oÂ«. Anaconda.
Clark, however, had. Just; come' ,to the
liking -of the taste of vengeance and re
fused flatly and v began to indulge in some
playful, little .sallies against .his enemy.
For ten years Daly had kept up a contin-
to Anaconda because the wife of the em
ploye had extended social courtesies to
some friends of Clark in an unwitting
moment.
Daly is represented as having given th a
bank employe Instructions to have the
association stopped.' The natural spunk rf
the. nonconformist wife prompted her to
remove to Spokane, without the bounds
of the State, where she could select her
own guests.
Another Incident, so says Alnslee'e Mag
azine, was that of an awkward funeral
of one of the miners in the copper dis
trict, In which both -factions were largely
represented. The pall-bearers were all
Daly men, and by some oversight the
master of ceremonies happened to bÂ«'a
Clark man. When the master of ceremo
nies gave the order to take up the coffin,
the black looks that had been threaten
ing culminated In a flat refusal, and a
deadly battle over the remains was avert
ed only by the, intervention of a priest.
Daly Is reputed as being a man of ma
licious'temperament and never forgetfiV
of a chance to "get back" at an offender.
While Clark Is not of that reputation the,

Clark drove Into Montana with an ot
team, and no money. About the earae tinsÂ«
en Irishman named Marcus Daly began
the life of a j>rosp.eetor in the Montana
mines. The two men were destined to \
life-lor.g- enmity, as the result of which
the entire population of the State of Mon
tana became of necessity divided against
Itself and was compelled to enlist with cm
faction or the other, carrying financial,
social, industrial and political Montana
into the war of private spleen and per
sonal grievance. The two men, once till
<rs of the soil and venders of potatoes
and drivers of street wagons, became rival
financial mapnates. and their antagonism
xvae carried from State politics into that
r.f the republfc. when Marcus. Daly of
Montana devised and set In' motion .th*
TnÂ»Â«-hin*-ry by which he hop*ed to disqual
ify William A. Clark, for his office in thÂ«
United States Senate.
Daly as s. prospector soon developed a
natural and far-famed shrewdness, and in
time cime to be practically the controller
of the ontire mining district of the State.
Acting for syndicate? a.nd private capital,
hp became the locator and operator for
the rich corporation composed of J. B.
HaÃgJri. I-loyd Tevis and Georpe Hearst
(afterward Senator). Clark had developed
Into a prosperous merchant and banker,
with money to invest in mines. Clark's
cpfcitaV-and Dal>'s keen-wittedness com
bined to form a most effective partuer-
Fh'.p ?nd soon Montana's early mining
business was influenced largely by the
Clark-Daly movements, and the Clarjt-
Daly combination grew to have a hand in
every important turn of mining affairs
Mining interests extended into landed In
tertsts, and widened out Into the forma
tion of new mine sites, and hence of r.*w
town*, eventually ending in railroad-*.
Fme'.tir.R works, banking establishments,
bunding enterprises, and naturaly. in poli
tics By the time their quarrel was rlpa
there- was hardly a phase of the State *
KCtiVttte* in which they were not either
Jointly or individually interested.
Jiijt how the o.uarrel came about tnÂ«
public does nat know, and no one knows
why their elope association began to
breAk. except it be Clark and Daly. From
the genesis to the revelations of the bit
ter feud which sprang up the inside work
ings were better understood by the prin
cipal* than by any one else. There are
different and differing stories told of the
source of the vendetta, but throughout
each of the narratives the individual Daly
is hopelessly confused with the Daly of
Eradicate interest, and Clark is accredited
v'ith seizing an opportunity for his own
private intcrc-usâ the opportunity having
been worked up for the syndicate interest
by Duly. At any rate, Clark's handling
of the opportunity was such that he was
â¢cabled to command an extortionate price
frÂ«n the syndicate, and the syndicate was
compelled to buy. J;^' ; :

mR. J. J. O'BttlE>J toache* the
breaking of arm* and lag*. It !a
an accomplishment that any ona
may acquire.
Not that we all need to acquire It.
Some of us are well content to leave all
the arms and legs vo know in unbroken
peace Instead of in broken pieces. But
w.Â«e never knows what may happen.
For instance, suppose you are a police
man. You may be of bull-dog build and
yet have mere trouble in settling some
hard case than a mite of a Jap wouldâ
a Jap who knows the tricks that Mr.
O'Brien learned while he was police in
spector in the land of the Jap. Or sup- â¢
pose you are the other person in â¢ the
policeman occurrence; it will be very con
venient for you to know how to dispose
of the dfflcer.
Mr. O'Brien's whole method of self
defensa is a mechanical proposition. He
places his opponent in a position where
his strength is vsed against himself and
where only his weak muscles are left
free for aggressive activity.
"The whole system is like that of kit-
tens," he says. "Watch them play . and
Mcuffle and wrestle and you'll see what I
mean."' He, and K. Inoue, the Japanese
who has come to assist him, have been
Â¦bowing forcibly what' he means. "
The grip is convenient to use In case a
1 man should be Impolite enough to raise

his flit' tM nur your fac*, There ii no
neÂ«d of turning tho ether check to be
(Â¦mitten. It is -much better to graap his
wr!Â»ti turn his arm over, outward, bo that
the weak outside muscles are brought up
v.-ard and the strong muscles cannot bo
brought into play.
Quickness is indlspensabla in every
move. In this point the kitten simile is
perfect. You may _vratch Mr. O'Brien
make a spring: upon his opponent and you
can no more tell how it is done than when
a cat springs, but you see the opponent
feeing resuscitated a few minutes later.
.He uses one hand in many of his moved
to turn aside the face of the opponent.
Any man is half helpless with his neck
bent back and his face turned so that he
cannot Bee his adversary's motions. There
are many tricks that have to do with the
leg. But beneath all, the mechanical law
of the armâ the law of the leverâ ls the
basis of operation.
The dictionary says: "A lever Is a me
chanical device consisting of a straight
bar turning freely on a fixed point 'and
serving'to Impart pressure or motion from'
a source of power to a resistance." This
is the principle of the arm's action, and
the Japanese scheme is to turn aside this
"pressure, or motion,", .to - make the
"power" either inactive or active' against
its owner.
The latter is Illustrated tn slipping tIM
arm B'.raight through tho opponent's,
bringing it upward so that the hand can
bÂ« placed on. the back of his neck. Hia
instlnctivq resistance Is mad* by pushing
his own,' arm forward (or freedom, and

to bo pressed*
Footpads are nald to have a little habit
of carr.i-rr upon you from behindhand sets*
Ins you in an embrace that pins yoai
arms to your sides. Mr. O'Brien's remedy
for this is to kneel Quickly, slipping
throuch the footpad's arm. Then ha Is

arm at the shoulder, twisting him forward
and over his head.
Box a man on one ear and. he retreat!
from the blow. Bex. him on both at once
and he is warranted not to trouble' you
further. There are odd little points about
the head and throat, where the prod of
one flnjer may settle an affair.
"It's just like this," concludes Mr. |
O'Brien. "By any of these tricks a man, J
woman or child can break a man's arm
or leg or perhaps ; injure - him internally.

to mediate when the tender may be rejected. The State Department has no reason to believe that Great
Britain desires mediation to end the war. The South African republic, while it has not directly invited the
President to mediate, has indicated its willingness that he should do so. Until the British Government, how
ever, conveys a similar intimation to the United States no action, in the view of the authorities, can be taken.
v PARIS, March. 3.â The Courier dv Soir, which is usually regarded as an inspired organ touching polit
ical matters, states that there is reason to believe Emperor William is disposed to offer his services in favor
of mediation in the Transvaal difficulty knowing that he is no longer isolated, and all the powers recognize
himas jhe most fitting sovereign to act the part of peacemaker. His telegram to the Queen after the vic

Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Preu.
PARIS, March 3.â Even- the MardiOras
carnival supplied an illustration of French
Anglophobia and of the Gallic admiration
of tho. Boers. - The news of the capitula
tion of General Cronje arrived on Mardi
Gras | and served as an occasion . for > a
demonstration against the British. The
crowds parading the boulevards in the
evening raised unceasing shouts of "A baa
Anglais!" "Vive les Boers!" Two En
glishmen who were indiscreetly seated on
the terrace- of a cafe in one of the boule
vards . were noticed and denounced by
some fanatics and ln a few moments the
merry throng of carnival makers was
metamorphosed into- a howling 'crowd,
yelling "Gonspuez les Anglais!"
The Englishmen were struck and forced
to take refuge within the cafe, which the
mob besieged .for an hour, until a strong
body of police arrived. The police charged
and dispersed the crowd, arresting six
person, who will be prosecuted for as

Boer Reverses Deplored.
The turn of the tide ln favor of Great
Britain in the Transvaal has produced a
painful impression here, although all the
best organs, while eulogizing the heroic
conduct of Cronje's army, pay tribute to
the splendid soldierly qualities shown by
both Roberts' and Buller's troops. A ma
jority of the newspapers urge Great
Britain to seize the present opportunity,
now that her military prestige is restored,
to make peace on the basis of the Indepen
dence of the Transvaal.
'A large section of public opinion de
mands that the European powers shall in
tervene and compel Great Britain to'ac
cept their mediation for the sake of the
two : plucky republics. President McKln
ley is freely, spoken of as the only chief
of state whose intervention could be ac
cepted by Great Britain, but at the same
time the ungracious character of such a
task is fully appreciated and the unlike
liness of . such a step is recognized. The
Figaro says:.-/ , / Â¦ .
"Anything is' possible from across the
Atlantic, but the President of the United

however, and* must be considered aa such.

The most important org-ans in the
human body are the kidneys.

Teller, Declares In the Senate That It
Confers Too Much Power Upon
â¢ the Secretary of the
' ; Treasury.
WASHINGTON, March B.â The Senate
held a brief session to-day, adjourning on
account of the death of Representative
Epes of Virginia. . During the session
Ross of Vermont spoke in opposition to
the seating of M. S. Quay and Teller
spoke in criticism of the conference re
port upon the currency bill. A number of
private pension bills were passed during
the day. i -.'.'Â¦ 'Â¦ V- " \ '
When the Senate convened Pettlgrew
Introduced and the Senate passed a reso
lution instructing the .Secretary of War
to send to the Senate the court-martial
proceedings of 1564 against Lieutenant
Colonel Corbin, now adjutant general of
the army. The resolution calls for other
information bearing upon General Cor
bin's military record. â¢
The Quay resolution was then laid be
fore the Senate and Ross of Vermont
argued against the seating of Quay. He
announced that his conclusion had , been
arrived at only after a careful study of
the constitution, and his argument was
based entirely upon his construction of
that instrument. He contended that un
der the constitutional provision- a va
cancy in the Senate could be tilled only
when it occurred during a recess of the
Legislature. The Quay case did not; to
his mind, meet this requirement.
Attacks the Currency Bill.
At the close of Ross* speech Teller of
Colorado took the floor to discuss the
conference report on the financial bill.
He maintained that too much power was
given the Secretary of the "Treasury and
he was opposed to all the provisions of
the measure, which he discussed in de
tail. Teller said he did not believe, it
was a good thing to extend the public
debt, but he did not think the gold stand
ard could be maintained without It. Tel
ler asserted that no effort Had been made
in the last twelve years to .reduce the
public debt, nor would there be by the
Republican party. Teller asked why, with
all the money In the treasury, it could
not be used to pay current. expenses In
stead of. lssuing, k-onds. ." ; Â¦
Allison replied that 1 this would prevent
any evil effects from a possible endless
chain and was to prevent a , drain upon
the treasury.
Teller said the power conferred upon
the Secretary of the Treasury under the
proposed law was practically unlimited.
He thought that except In extreme cases
it was a mistake to give unlimited au
thority to an official. He did not. there
fore, believe the Secretary should have
power to suspend the issuance of certifi
cates. There was. to his mind no reason
for ' the ' provision for the exchange of
bonds. Â¦ Â¦' .
Referring to the 'premium of 6 per cent
on the proposed bonds; Teller argued that
they would still gd' higher the
holder could at any time get the full face
value of them In money, drawing a per
cent interest while holding the bonds,
meantime paying no taxes, lie predicted
that under the operation of the proposed
law the banks could control 'the volume
of -the currency. When they wanted to
create a fall in prices. or to coerce Con
gress thpy- would have nothing to do but
go to â¢ the . treasury with their notes, get
the currency and? return them when they
got ready, thus forcing' contraction or
expansion at will, and thus, he supposed,
flying us that promised elastic currency.
Jnder this provision the banks would
practically control the business of the
country. ...Â¦;.. â¢
Believes Gage Is Honest.
Referring to the recent act of the treas
ury in coming to the assistance of the
banks in an emergency, he said that the
money then deposited could not now be
taken out without creating disastrous ef
fects. He did not mean to criticize Sec
retary Gage for his action in the matter.
He did not- believe him to be dishonest,
but under the power, given a dishonest
man in his position could have made un
told wealth out of the transaction. He did
not blame the banks, he said,. but the sys
tem which allowed the Government to go
to their relief when. asked for- relief. Why
should the Government sustain a bank
any more than any other institution?
Teller criticized the bimetallic declara
tion of the bill as silly, and' weak, because
It meant nothing. No man. who had voted
for the bill as It passed had a right to call
himself a bimetallism > Senators who had
etood here for years calling themselves
bimetallists had accepted the -gold stand
ard bill at the dictates of a caucus and the
probability was that they would. co to tho
full length demanded by the banks.
At 3 o'clock the pension appropriation,
bill was taken up, but on account of the
slim attendance of Senators .its final con
sideration was postponed. The Senate
then went Into executive session.
Â¦ After the executive session â¢ the doors
â¢were reopened and the Senate took up
private pension bills, of which thirty
seven were passed. â¢ - .
Martin of Virginia announced the death
of Representative Epes. and the following:
Senators were appointed a committee, to
attend the funeral on behalf of the Sen
ate;. Daniel, Martin, Perkins, Scott and
Harris. As a further mark of respect the
Senate then nt 3:45 p. m. adjourned.

ANONYMOUS ATTACK ON
CHARLESTON'S OFFICERS
Unknown Writer Says Drunkenness
Was the Cause of the' Loss of
the Cruiser.
WASHINGTON. March 3.â Sensational
charges are contained in an anonymous
letter which has been received at the
Navy Department from Manila. The
communication relates to the wrecking of
the Charleston and makes the serious
statement that a number of officers of the
vessel at the time of the disaster were
under the influence of liquor. The corre
spondent who furnishes the information
claims to have verified the allegations by
dillgient inquiry among the officers of the
Charleston.
The letter was not placed on the official
filee, on account of the peculiar nature of
the charges, but It has been referred to
the'Judpe Advocate General of the navy
with instructions from Secretary Long
that the matter be Investigated at once.
This inquiry probably will not take, a
more formidable aspect than that of a
note of inquiry addressed to the comman
der in chief of the Asiatic station.
Naval officers here who have seen the
letter say there was nothing to Justify
the charges, and they believe the depart
ment's inquiry will relieve the accused of
ficers from the unwarranted allegations.
Captain Pigman, who commanded the
Charleston at the time of the wreck, is
not involved in any of the charges.

Has Congestion, of the
Lungs, With Symptoms
of- Pneumonia.
Her Condition Considered So Grava
That Physicians Order That No
One Be Permitted to Enter
the Sickroom.
.
NEW YORK. March 4.â Tho Journal and
Advertiser says: Mrs. Leland Stanford,
widow of the late multi-millionaire Sena
tor from California, is dangerously 111 at
the Fifth-avenue Hotel. Mrs. Stanford
came to this city from the "West two
weeks ago to attend to business affairs,
with the object in view. It is said, of con
verting some of her Southern Pacific Rail
road stock into cash for the Leland Stan
ford University.
Ten days ago Mrs. Stanford contracted
a cold while out driving and the next day
was confined to her room. Physicians
were sent for and advised caution, al
though at the time the illness was not
thought to be serious.
Mrs. Stanford, in spite of remedies,
however, grew worse. The fact of her
illness was telegraphed to her brother In
California, with consoling assurances, but
the daily bulletins were such as to glva
him the greatest alarm.
Mrs. Stanford's condition did not be
come really serious until two days ago.
when the lungs became congested and
symptoms of pneumonia developed. As
soon as these alarming symptoms became
apparent the physicians instructed the
nurses and Mrs. Stanford's secretary that
no one under any circumstances should
be permitted to see the patient- for at
least four days. In that time It Is hoped
to discover if the illness had been- compli
cated and is of so grave a character that
relatives must be summoned to the bed
side.

WASHINGTON. M*rch3.-Ed ward Flan

a. number of women secretly carried flow

was no organized demonstration they
Â¦were not arrested.
Â¦Flanigan explained the "permit" sys

ADMINISTRATION BLOCKS
HEPBURN'S CANAL BILL
Would Prevent Its Passage Until the
Hay-Pauncefote Treaty Re
Ratified.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 3.âRepresenta
tive Hepburn may find Speaker Hender
son standing across his path next Monday
when be tries to get up his resolution
setting a day for the consideration of the
Nicaraguan canal bill. Administration In
fluences are being exerted to the utmost
to prevent consideration , of the bill be
fore the ratification of the pending Hay-
Pauncef ote treaty by the Senate. It is
believed that If the House should pass
the bill without regard for the convention
It would complicate matters In the Sen.
ate. The passage of the bill by the House
at this time would be considered by
friends of the administration as a reflec
tion on the President. .
The Hepburn bill proceeds on the theory
that the " Clay ton-Bulwer treaty Is no
longer binding. The administration be
lieves that it is, and acted on this belief
in. negotiating the new treaty. If the
House should now pass the Hepburn bill
it would be construed as a condemnation
by the House of the course of the admin
istration in negotiating that treaty. For
this reason Speaker Henderson Is being
urged not to recognize Hepburn on Mon
day to call up his proposed resolution, and
It Is said that the Representative will
not be recognized.
Ludlow to Remain at Havana.
WASHINGTON. March 3.â lt Is said at
the War Department that' there is no Im
mediate Intention to make any changes in
the military commands in Cuba. A spe
cific denial was made of the story that
General Fitzhugh Lee is to succeed Gen
eral Ludlow as military governor of the
city of Havana. General Ludlow's ass'gn
ment as president of the Military War
College is not intended to interfere with
his duties .In Havana, and, so far as
known, he is likely to continue to act 'in
this capacity until the War Department
has formulated Its plans for the with
drawal of a large portion of the military
forces in Cuba.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, March 3.
âThe House to-day passed Representa
tive de Vries' resolution authorizing the
Secretary of the Interior to open negotia
tions for the purchase of. and, if possi
ble, to bond the Calaveras big tree grove.
Speaker Henderson recognized Mr. de
Vries Immediately after the first routine
work of the- day was completed. As the
result of excellent missionary work done
yesterday by the California representa
tives among the members of the House,
not an objection was heard when unani
mous consent to the passage of the reso
lution was asked.
On Tuesday or Wednesday Senator
Perkins will call up the measure In the
Senate, where It will pass with equal
promptness. Mr. de Vries hopes to lay
the engrossed bill before the President
for his signature not later than Wednes
day. . '
Under the terms of the resolution, an
amicable effort for the purchase of the
big tree groves must first be made. Rob
ert Whiteside of Duluth. Minn., holds the
bond for Mr. Sperry for the sale of these
trees. Correspondence has already been
opened with Mr. Whiteside to learn his
disposition In the matter. It is believed
that he will consent to the sale of the
groves. If he does not consent, or if
he evinces a disposition to raise objec
tions, with a view to Increasing the price
of the groves. Mr. de Vries will follow
up to-day's resolution with another, au
thorizing and directing the Secretary of
the Interior to institute condemnation
proceedings to acquire the property. But
as a matter of fact it is believed Mr.
Whiteside will co-operate with Mr. de
Vries and that the groves will be pur
chased speedily and at a reasonable fig
ure.
The California delegation has acted as
a unit in the matter and has been great
ly assisted by the earnest work of the
California Club and other organizations
in the State.

LONDON. Ma^ch 3.â "With the triumph
of the British arms the bogy of Conti
nental Interference has passed Into se
clusion and now a new and more curious
(and, to Americans, more interesting)
phase comes over the fascinating web of
international relations as portrayed
through the press. This consists of sup
positions regarding the attitude of the
American Congress toward Great Britain;
the possibility of its recommending Inter
vention, voting sympathy with the Boers,
refusing to ratify the Nicaragua treaty,
and lastly, but chiefly, refusing to con
sider the Canadian contentions in a spirit
of friendliness. The great public interest
in aU, this is mainly the result of many
special cable dispatches from English cor
respondents, stating that the administra
tion, being severely attacked for alleged
friendliness toward Great Britain and in
view of the coming election, might be
forced*, to make some sort of an anti-
British demonstration in order to offset
such accusations as that of forming an
alliance.
To cap this climax comes a strenuous
appeal in the Times to-day that Lord
Pauncefote, the British Embassador at
Washington, should be retained, at any
rate, until the election is over.
Chamberlain Has Protested.
Inquiries reveal the fact that the Gov
ernment's attitude, which is the only ons
worth anything at present, must be con
sidered from two points of view â that of
the Foreign Office and that of the Colo
nial Office. Between these there is a
great gulf, daily widening, not so much
personally between Lord Salisbury and
Joseph Chamberlain, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, as between their
departments.
For weeks the friction has been growing
until the Colonial Office is almost at log
gerheads not only with the Foreign Of
tice, but with almost every other depart
ment. To such an extent has this gone
that any minor detail of business sub
mitted to the Colonial Office by outsiders
but requiring the sanction, say, of the
War Office, is almost certain to fail to go
through owing to Chamberlain's unwill
ingness to co-operate with other heads.
Alliance Not Possible.
It Is the Foreign Office and the Colonial
Office which may be said to be chiefly con
cerned in the relations with the United
States. The former meets all the situa
tions broadly, as It would in dealing with
any Contine'nial power. The latter looks
at "all United States matters through the
eye of Canada. Hence, between the two
departments there are differences of
opinion and sometimes friction. Regard
ing Lord Salisbury's point of view the
Associated Press is able to say that he is
averse to any form of Anglo-American
alliance, believing that the constitution
is unsuited to such a bond. To use the
words of one who is in the closest confi
dence of the Premier the. politics of the
United States have, such an influence on
foreign policy and -render the duration of
supreme power so uncertain that any alli
ance would kill Itself Quicker than any
one could kill it. He feels under no obli
gations to foster pro-English sentiment
in the United States. -In - fact, for the
most part, he remains in profound ignor
ance as to the trend of American public
opinion. His idea, as represented by the
speaker just quoted, is to trade fairly and
squarely without embroiling himself with
any extraneous matters, nor does he de
sire to sacrifice the good of the whole em
pire for the sake of Canada alone. In the
case of Lord Pauncefote, Lord Salisbury
has taken no steps and at present does
not contemplate doing anything to pre
vent Lord Pauncefote from retiring April
1, in accordance with the age limlit of the
diplomatic service. '
Chamberlain Iff akin g Trouble.
But while Lord Salisbury and the For
eign Office confine themselves to the bread
issues at stake and marvel at the account
attributing to them a desire to form an
American alliance the Colonial Office bus
ies itself with minute considerations, and
apparently conforms its opinions and a;
tions to meeting:, in behalf of Canada, the
political feeling in the United States as
cabled by the English correspondents.
Thus Mr. Chamberlain several times has
protested against projected agreements
with the United States, and has sometimes
prevailed. At present there prevails In the
Colonial Office an overwhelming dread of
American complications, Fenian raids into
Canada and wrat not. while there are
hopes of getting the Alaskan and other
disputes settled. The lew ebb of this feel
ing is not shared in the slightest by tho
Foreign Office. Mr. Chamberlain also
exhibits almost painful anxiety to keop
in touch with the party in power in Cana
da, the latest instance of which is in his
cable to the Australian governments ask
ing if they could raise 23Q0 troops. As
published here, the report said "in the
event of imperial troops being needed else
where," and several papers interpreted
this to mean that the Government fsared
European hostility. But it is learned that
Mr Chamberlain merely asked for troops,
neither mentioning, nor contemplating any
such contingency as conveyed by the er
roneously reported addition to the request.
It was originally intended that these
troops should come from Canada, perhaps
augmented by many Britishers from the

MRS. LELAND STANFORD.military cabinet. Several members of the
President's household were also present.
General Porter introduced Mr. Thomp
son to President Loubet, and the pre
sentation of the dollar was then made by
Mr. Thompson. He said:
Mr. President:; In the name, and on behalf
of the President of the United States, I hare
the distinguished honor of extending to you,
the high representative of the republic of
France, salutations and greetings of friendship.
From the 17th of October, lS9B,;the anniver
sary of the victory of Yorktown," won by thÂ«
French and American arms in the cause of
liberty, the American school youths were in
vited by ; the President and Governors of the
several States of the United States to contrib
ute their pennies toward Â¦ the erection of â¢ the
monument ln Paris to a son of France, our
great and venerated ally. General Lafayette.
The response of the children was universal,
the movement a splendid success. In further
aid and in honor of the work an Issue of 50.000
souvenir sliver dollars ! was appropriated and
ordered struck by Congress.
Of these 60,000 Lafayette dollars the first to
issue from the Mint was especially preserved
for your Excellency by the President of the
United States, and I have now the distinguished
honor, Mr. President, of presenting to you this
coin, a simple and sympathetic token in his
name and for the people of the United States.
I voice the sentiments of my countrymen
â¢when I express the hope that this memorial
dollar, etamped with the likeness of Wash
ington and Liafayette, may remain always, as
it is to-day, an emblem of the amity and the
unity of purpose of the two great republics of
the world.
Loubet Deeply Touched.
In reply the President said he was deep
ly touched by the kind thought of Amer
ica's President and people, and particu
larly by the gracious manner in which the
coin had been presented to him by Mr.
Thompson. He begged the latter to be the
interpreter to the President of his warm
est thanks and sentiments toward Presi
dent McKinley and the American nation
which animated the President and Gov
ernment of the French republic. M. Loubet
added that he congratulated himself on
receiving this souvenir, which was a frseh
pledge of the reciprocal ties of esteem and
friendship which had so long united
France and the United States and which
he hoped to see draw closer and stronger.
President Loubet concluded by saying
that it was especially agreeable to him
that the mission was intrusted to Mr.
Thompson, in view of the initiatory part
which the latter took in the subscriptions
of the school children to erect a monu
ment to General Lafayette in Paris.
The French President then invited Gen
eral Porter, and Mr. Thompson to stay to
luncheon, at which Madame Loubet and
M. Delcasse were present., ,
During the luncheon'which followed, M.
Loubet engaged ln animated conversation
with General Porter and Mr. Thompson,
in which he accentuated and amplified
what he had. previously said ln his formal
response on the subject of the historical
and sentimental ties between the two re
publics and his sincere desire for a good
understanding. He alluded to the Franco-
American reciprocity treaty now before
the two parliaments, and dwelt upon the
mutual advantages he hoped would ac
crue therefrom, expressing his opinion
that not? merely the articles directly af
fected by the treaty would benefit, but
that the whole trade between the two
countries would undergo sympathetic ex
pansion, and that the channel of com
mercial Intercourse would widen inevita
bly ln the course of time.
Mutual Trade Relations.
"We both have reasons to desire a de
velopment of mutual trade," M. Lou
bet remarked. "You want our luxuries
and we need your articles of necessity."
The President then spoke of the great
wheat production of the United States
and its enormous agricultural possibili
ties.
Mr. Thompson told the President there
was a movement on foot ln Chicago to
found a branch of the Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution among the descendants of
French soldiers who had fought side by
side with, the American colonists in the
war of independence. President Loubet
showed keen Interest ln the idea and Mr.
Thompson left with a confident feeling
that the French'authoritles here will give
the fullest assistance to the establish
ment of a French Â¦ branch and in search
ing the military records for the names of
those who participated In the war.
General Porter and Mr. Thompson were
delighted with the exceptional cordiality
of their reception. The function differed
from- the usual ceremonies of the kind
in the absence of chilling, formality, : M.
Loubet putting his visitors at complete
ease by the affability of his greeting. .
The President placed the Presidential
box at the Theater :Francaise on Monday
and at the opera on ' Wednesday at | Mr.
Thompson's disposal. The latter will send

First of the Lafayette Dollars Pre

PARIS, March 3.â Robert J. Thompson,
secretary of the Lafayette Monument
Commission, as special commissioner of
the United States, representing the Presi

Loubet this morning the first of the La
fayette dollars, which was Inclosed In a
casket costing $1000. The presentation toon
place at Elysee Palace.
Mr. Thompson, accompanied by the
United States Embassador, General Hor

palace in the.Embassador's carriage. On
arriving at the Elysee. at 11:45 a. m., they
were received by M. Mellard, sub-direotor
of the protocol, and Captain Haguet of
the French navy, who was the officer 01
duty. The Americans were conducted to
the President's study, where M. Loubet
was awaiting them. By his side were M.

and General Baillaud of the President's
This photograph shows the residence, barn and surrounding grove of Mr. Lowentrout, which are situate on section
25 and are on the opposite side of the street from the land in controversy, namely, section 30. The printed inscription on
the bottom of the picture is declared to be absolutely false.
1891; that the section 30 contest cases had
been tried before him. and that he was
familiar with the premises in dispute.
Witness was subjected to a rigid exam
ination by Houghton with a view to es
tablishing what knowledge he had of the
premises to Justify certain passages of his
written decision. Houghton asked witness
whether counsel for Gage or any other
counsel opposed to Atwater, Gunther and
Newman had called attention in court to
any error In the photograph or inscrip
tion known as exhibit 57. The objection
was overruled. Witness could not remem
ber.
H. Newman was next called to the
stand. He testified that he resided in Riv
erside and was one of the contestants for
section 30. Â¦ Witness remembered photo
graphs taken in 1595 by Corl & Sanborn.
He was not with Corl when the pictures
were taken. He testified as to who was in
Houghton's room when the affidavits were
made. He said there were Houghton, At
water, Gunther, Corl and himself.
Houghton on the. Stand.
At the afternoon session Houghton took
the stand ln his own defense. He test'
fied that he was the attorney for contest
ants Atwater, Gunther and Newman in
the section SO case. He said that the af
fidavits in question were made ln connec
tion, with the petition by Gage for a re-re
vlew of the proceedings before the Land
Department. "Witness said that the pnoto
graphs were made with the view of show
ing the improvements on the homestead
claims and that the property was subject
to homestead filings. There was no inten
tion of deceiving any one or of gaining
any unfair advantage over Matthew Gage.
He had suggested the idea of having pho
tographs taken. The department had lim
ited the time and everything was done ln
haste. No careful examination was mado
of the photographs, but witness supposed
instructions had been complied with.
witness first knew of the error after
Gunther's testimony when he told him at
his room that Atwater's house was not
shown in the photograph. His insistence
upon the point when Gunther was testi
fying was inspired by his own certainty
at that time that the house was there.
He had made Gunther correct the testi
mony as soon as he had learned that it
was wrong, and as far as he knew tha
explanation had been satisfactory to op
posing counsel.
On cross-examination by Attorney
Adair, witness admitted that he had seen
the property several times, but never to
make a close inspection. He said the
Secretary of the Interior could not be de
ceived because he had exhibit 56, which
showed the Atwater house. Plaintiff tried
to introduce certain evidence going to
show that Houghton had used Influence
with the Secretary of the Interior. Some
witnesses were recalled by the court. Ar
guments were heard in the evening and
the matter was taken under consideration
by the court.
History of the Case.
Matthew Gage was the constructor of
the canal which waters higher Riverside
lands. Section 30 was taken up by Gage
under the desert land act, and was to have
been patented by him when water from
the canal was turned on. By alleged com
plicity of the engineers, the water was
not turned on in time. The claim was
then Jumped by Gunther, Atwater and
Newman on homestead filings. The long
litigation over the ejectment suits was
finally decided in Gage's favor by Judge
Noyes. Disbarment proceedings were
then Instituted by Gage.

nished another unmistakable proof of the
existence of this feeling. Referrence to
the event in the French Journals of all
political shades have been invariably of
the most sympathetic character and the
ceremony itself is treated as if destined
to prove another link in the historical
friendship of the two nations. President
Loubet himself is charmed with the
whole affair and the manner in which it
was carried out. Prior to the ceremony
he privately expressed these sentiments,
and also his view that the way the
scheme had been taken up was an indi
cation of the attitude of the great body
of American opinion toward France:
Another expression of the feeling in the

viewing the inception and . execution of
the idea, concludes by saying:

RtVERSIDE, March 3.â The retrial of
R. E. Houghton for disbarment was
resumed in the Superior Court at 9
o'clock this morning. Matthew
Gage. was recalled to the stahd by
the defense. In connection' with Mr.
Gage's testimony Mr. Houghton intro
duced the testimony of Gage in relation
to certain deeds taken at a previous trial
evidently with the intent of discrediting
the witness (Gage) and showing fraud on
the part of Gage and his wife. After this
was read Mr. Houghton said this was of
fered to show the lengths to which Mr.
Gage would go when section 30 was at
tacked. The attorneys for the prosecu
tion objected to this testimony going in,
and the objection was sustained.
P. S. Corl was recalled and the negatives
of the photographs identified and offered
in evidence. On cross-examination by Mr.
Houghton witness said he had put his
name on the negatives merely because
they were his work. He didn't tell defend
ant what description to put on the nega
tives. Plaintiff closed at 10:30.
Motion for Nonsuit.
At this point the defense moved for a
nonsuit and that the case be thrown out
on the ground that the plaintiff had not
shown facts sufficient to warrant the
court in considering the question on its
merits; that the plaintiff had utterly
failed to prove that defendant Houghton
had used photographs with the purpose
of deceiving the Land Department or of
gaining any unfair or unconscionable ad
vantage over Matthew Gage. The motion
was overruled.
Judge J. S. Noyes was the first witness
called by the defense. Judge Noyes testi
fied that he had lived in Riverside since

16VICTIMIZED BY SOLDIERS
Two Young Men Systematically
Work Coast Towns.
gpÂ»-{Â«I Ditrateb to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, March 3.â The citi
zens of this town have, through their
eyrapathy for the unfortunate. Just been
subjected to one of the most despicable
cases of fraud ever known hereabouts.
Two your.g men fvearins Uncle Sara's uni
form and carrying the badge of the hos
pital corps, arrived in town about six
veÂ«?K.E ago. One Of therh was sick and the
other was in attendance upon him. Their
jtorv was teat, they had b*en discharged
trom the United States Hospital Corps at
Manila on account of illness and given
transportation only as far as San Fran
tlsco and were trying to secure .sufficient
coney to get back to their home in the
Eaet. The one who was well went to sev
tral cf the clergymen ol the town, show
2t his discharge papers and letters and
Â»tner papers, and succeeded in making
leverai people (among them some mem
eerfi cf the newly organized Woman's Re
lief Corps of the G. A. R.) believe in the
renuineness cf his statement and secured
ce.p in various ways.
The nrabÂ»r? of the Woman's Relief
rorps "were carried .Â«o far in their sym
pathtes as to arrange a benefit tnusicale
to take place next week. The posters for
;h!s benefit came cut and a large number
Â»f tickets were sold, when news came here
trom Salinas that pseudo Red Cross
c-rÂ«** had tried the same, game in that
-l'y and bring discovered to be. frauds
ind'epium fiends had been run out of
â¢own. The same thing occurred at Castro
rtlle- and Watsonville and then the pair
tried it on Pacific Grove. It now tran
nires that they tampered with their dis
rharge papers, changing "disability" to
â¢â¢dvjentery." to excite sympathy.
' The ladies who arranged the benefit re
'us* to believe that they have been im
oo?ed upon and intend going on with their
)rigi!na> plan, though it is doubtful if they
i-ave an audience, the townspeople feel
â¢rg greatly incensed at the abuse prac
ticed upon their patriotism and sympa

CHANCES OF

BERLIN". March 3.â Most Important
natters werÂ© transacted during the week
la thÂ« Reichstag before almost empty
benches. Friday's opening cession saw
;preclsely twenty delegates in attendance.
Herr Eugene Richter. in tte Fressinnige
Zeltung. holds that the fact that members
of the Reichstag received no remunera
tion in any form for their services is re
sponsible for this state of affairs. Cer
tainly, in the Prussian and other German
state Diets, where liberal compensation
;* paid, there never is such a scarcity of
delegates. â¢ The consequence was that
Herr Richter and other Reichstaeers re
peatedly during the week compelled the
Reichstag majority to do their bidding
.on threat of ascertaining whether a
cuoruzn was present, a quorum in the
Reichstag meaning half cf the delegates.
The Foreign O&ce budget being taken
W. a variety of matters came under dis
cussion, even the query as to why the
Prussian Government gave a Prussian
deccratlon to a German of Chicago. How
ever, Count yon Buiow. the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, made a good showing and
t . t his salary voted.
Naval BUI.
' ThÂ« chances of the naval bill have
grown rather worse lately. The
Center, the Conservatives and the A-grar
ians are demanding compensation for
their votes, the former asking for the re
call cf the Jesuits and the latter demand
ing a meat law to suit their convenience
and guarantees from the Government
that Agrarian Interests will not be neg
lected in the projected commercial treat
ies. There will evidently be a hard pull
to get the bill through, though there is
every indication that popular sentiment
against the electors is rising for the naval
Increase. One such indication was in the
Reichstag bye-election in the Catbe-
Aschersteben district, when the National-
Liberal candidate wrested a seat formerly
held by the Socialists evidently under a
strong Sect issue.
Reichst&g Programme.
The prorrasmae fixed for thÂ« Reichstag
is as folows:
Thursday is fixed for the reading of the
neat bill, then the currency bill and the
r.nal readies of the Lexheinze. against
which there is strong opposition by artists
and writers. Later there will be the
tir.ai reidir.g of the meat bill and some
other measures of less importance, thus
carrying the sessions to the Eastertide
adjournment. To carry the meat bill the
right side cf the Center will summon all
its defaulting: members during the coming
Â¦week to the Reichstag.
The National Zeitung-, speaking about
the meat bill to-day, expresses the belJff
that the Government will not approve the
Â¦bill as now constituted and thus tie its
hands regarding the coming commercial
treaties, r.ot only with the United States
but also with Russia, Scandinavia, Hol
lir.d, etc. It says:
"A general tariff war would be the re
fuit if the bill became a law ail to ap
pease the insatiable Agrarians. The total
proportion cf meat imports after the new
year of 130* would be tantamount to meat
usury."
Rail-way Service Poor.
The Prussian Diet this week considered
thÂ« railroad budget. It was plainly shown
that the Prussian Etate railway system
Is fearfully behind in cemfert and the
latest improvements, all because cf fear
cf diminishing the annual surplus. Herr
Macco, a National Liberal civil engineer,
demonstrated that even Russia, Austria-
Hur.fary and Bavaria were ahead of
Prussia' in this respect. The Minister of
Put?::c Works. Herr Thleien. w^uld not
even promise a passenger fare reduction,
although certain Prussian fares are five
tiirus higher than those charged in Hun
g*r-.- for the same distance.
The South African war continues to
hc'.d the attention of the public here.
"While sympathy for the Boers continues,
resp*ct "ior the British has risen under
their latest successes. Lieutenant Gen
eral Becher. in the Lokal Ar.zeiger, to
day says the wÂ»U-p!ar.ned action of Lord
Rciberts has brought about a total change
at the seat of war, a chance such as a
lavrrsan would not nave thought. The
.Â¦writer concludes that the war for the
Boers is row a hcpeless struggle, for they
lack that which alone could have given
their victories a permanent valueâ that is
to say, the capacity of fructifying victory
-by pursuing the enemy to the point of
annihilation.

BOSTON. March 3.â Whitelaw . Reid,
member of the late Paris Peace Commis
sion, and Dr.- Jacob G. Schurman. presi
dent of the first commission to the Philip
pines, were the guests and the principal
speakers at the meeting of the Massachu
setts Club in Young's Hotel this after
noon. Representative Republican business
and professional men to the number of
seventy-five were present.
Reid spoke of the Paris treaty of peace
as an act accomplished and that must be
lived up to. The question now was how
to deal with the territories acquired un
der the treaty. He declared that the ad
mission of the mixed races of these Isl
ands to full rights of American citiren
ship was beyond question, and that the
impracticable demands of those who were
harrassing the administration to abandon
the Islands must not be listened to. Reid
believed the administration was pursuing
the right course, and the present duty," he
said, was : to render . the Government full
support. ~ Â» ~gMBBBjWwfeBIJgM33BBIByWgBtÂ»Â»t

The cross-examination was directed
mainly to snowing- that the witness had
no personal knowledge of the facts and
spoke only from general hearsay. He pre

receipt of letters from Rev. Mr. Clemen

DOMINICANA.
J~\ N attractive addition to the periodical literature
,f~\ of the city appears this month with the first
* â¢ * number of a magazine bearing the title,
"Dominicana." It is to be devoted mainly to the af
fairs of the Dominican Fathers and the interests of
lhat order. It is announced, however, that it will be
.-: family magazine also, and "a means of communica
tion between priests and people, a chronicle of events
interesting to the members of our different congre
gations, and a sympathetic advocate of the educa
tional work with which the Sisters of St. Dominic
are so honorably identified."
. Among the notable articles in the first number are:
"Dominican Missions in the Philippine Islands,"
"St. Thomas Aquinas," "The Rosary â Mary's Gift."
r.iid a continued story, "The Secret of Grossmeister
Gin's." by Margaret D. O'Brien. There are also
â¢. several original poems of rare merit, that add con
siderably to the literary interest of the number.
; The magazine will be found of particular value to
all who desire to keep posted on the affairs of the ad
ministration of the Roman church, as close attention
will be given to such matters by the editors, and, as
iÂ« stated in the introduction, "The establishment of
a permanent bulletin guaranteeing to the people pre
cise and accurate information concerning "the feasts
end celebrations of the church, the work of societies
and general organization of religious life among the
young and the old, is an enterprise which can justly
count on the cordial approval of those for whose
benefit it is inaugurated."
.". The dispatches announce that the war in the Philip
jpines it practically over. There must be a dreadful
skfeasm in the announcement to those that have
wiitched the little army of the dead lowered body by
body from the coffin ship Hancock now in the har
bor.

AN EXPERIMENT OF THE KAISER.
KAISER WILLIAM, in addition to writing a
drama for the purpose of elevating the stage,
pushing a railway project in Syria for the pur
pose of expanding German commerce, and. promoting
an extensive naval programme for purposes not yet
declared, has undertaken to prevent large department
stores in Germany from driving the smaller traders
out of business. To that end his Ministers have in
troduced into the Reichstag a bill imposing a heavy
graded tax on the big stores, and it is being sup
ported with all the strength of the court and the
administration.
A correspondent of the London Chronicle, in giv
ing an account of the measure, says it divides staple
articles of merchandise into four groups â first, eat
ables, drinkables and drugs; second, drapery and
clothing; third," house furnishing; fourth, gold, silver*
stationery, objects of '/Â¦ art and instruments and

Sacramento Bee to the People of the Town of Washington Across
the River.
A proposition has been made that if you will permit the iniquitous poolroooms
to nourish In your midst the owners of these dens of Satan will either light
your town or pave your streets.
Good people and neighbors, can you afford to put your homes in darkness,
wring your hearts in sorrow and anguish, in order that your town may be Il
luminated?
"Would it not be a fearful price to pay for paving your streets if your own
aons were started on that path which is smoothly macadamized to hell?
And, good people and neighbors, who would really pay for lighting your town
or paving your Btreets?
Not the poolroom owners. That money would be wruns; from the fathers
and mothere, employers and employes of Sacramento and Washington. It would
be taken from the family hoard, would be wrested from wives and babies, would
be stolen from tills.
Your town might be illuminated, but by Its light you would see some promis
ing young men on their way to State prison, disgraced and damned for life.
Your streets might be paved, but it would be hell's own pavement.
â¢Be warned in time, good friends and | neighbors. You have homes of your
own. You, good women, have husbands whom you love, sons whom you idolize.
Are you willing to see your homes blighted as many a good and happy home In
Sacramento has been? \ .
Are you willing to pay the terrible price for street illumination or street
paving?
The Bee knows what it la talking about. The people of Sacramento know by
bitter experience. Not all the faro games that have flourished in California
since the early days have done the work of the devil to such an extent as have
these later day poolrooms. '
Good people and neighbors: Do you want Sacramento's experience repeated
in your own little town? Do you want your sons ruined, your homes devas
tated by this curse?.
Slf not. stand firm and stand fast against the iniquity that Is seeking to
fasten Itself on your community. 'Â¦.'..

What you are good enough to add of
the interest I feel in the present position
of your country emboldens me to say
that the news of the opening of your

are those even in Rome who feel with
you in the delicacy and difficulty of
your position, as a nation with a right
to self-government which is in danger
of becoming only a name. It seems *o
us that it is an anachronism to limit the
powers of the people, and that the ten
dency of the age is to enlarge, not to
lessen the bonds of freedom. Let us
hope that the militarism which is now
passing over Europe is only a tempo
rary distemper, and that the rulers of
nations will come to see that countries
are not made great by great armies, but
by the just laws which, make happy and
contented peoples. If this hope were

THE BEE'S BUZZ SAW.
THE Sacramento Bee harks back to the con
ventions, platforms and personalities of 1896 to
explain its position on non-constitutional gov

it the early approval of such government by the San
Francisco Examiner, and in turn we receive with
philosophy the attention of the Bee's business end to
The CalL As we don't store honey in the same hive
that is legitimate. But the Bee socks it* stinger up
to the hilt into the Examiner. We had supposed that
the two hummed in the same hive, pastured on the
same blossoms and were ready at any time to swap
bee bread and wax. We must have been mistaken,
for the Bee buzzes and says: "While the San Fran
cisco Examiner to a certain extent supported Bryan,
it never was in favor of the silver clause. It is not
now in favor of it. The Journal, which is the New
York end of this journalistic Siamese twins, is daily
sneering at Bryan's loyal devotion to the cause of
silver. Neither the Journal nor the Examiner wants
Bryan to bt the people's nominee this year. But the
Journal and the Examiner and all other enemies put
together cannot compass his defeat at Kansas City.
If The Call hereafter desires to point out to the Bee
its duty in any matter it had better quote from tome
more respected authorities than Grover Cleveland or
the San Francisco Examiner."
All right. We won't do it any more. We supposed
that harmony, quiet, heavenly harmony, like that of
the morning stars or two babies sucking the two ends
of the same stick of candy, prevailed in the Bryan
camp. It is a painful disillusion to be told that the
Examiner is opposed to Bryan. Not only is it dis
agreeable as removing a fixed impression, but it is a
distinct advantage to Bryan on which we had not
counted. We had treated his candidacy as handi
capped by the Examiner's support, but it seems that
he goes into the running lighter than our estimate.
The Bee will consult our peace of mind and
strengthen our conviction of Republican success if it
will shuffle again and see if it can't bring Bryan out
burdened by the Examiner's support.

THE COST OF TRACK GAMBLING.
SUPERVISOR TOBIN'S argument in favor of
the racetrack gamblers is made up of two
countsâ first, that the gamblers have made a
large investment of money and are entitled to such
privileges as will enable them to earn a revenue
from it; second, that the license fee fixed by his reso
lutions will bring to the city a revenue of $100 a day.
For the sake of these monetary considerations he is
willing to give the Eastern gamblers full liberty to
encourage vice and to bring as many men, women
and boys as they can to those dishonorable practices
that lead to crime and to suicide.
There may be others in the city who, like Tobin,
look upon money as the supreme thing in the world,
and regard profit and interest as matters superior to
all the virtues combined. It is therefore worth while
to point out that even from their point of view the
aigument of Tobin is invalid, because it is based upon
an erroneous calculation of the financial results of
track gambling. Mr. Tobin has taken into consid
eration only that side of the ledger which shows the
credits due to the gamblers, and has ignored that
which shows their debts to the community.
In the first place the investment made by the gam
blers is not an industrial nor a commercial invest
ment. It produces nothing that adds to the wealth
of the city. On the contrary, it is in the nature of a
sponge. It absorbs wealth and gives nothing. The
money which passes into the hands of the gamblers is
drawn from the community, and the community re
ceives in return for it no single thing of any value.
The gamblers grow rich and disport their ostenta
tious vices in our most expensive hotels and saloons,
but their dupes sink steadily downward to the poor
house or the Morgue.
The amount of money which the gamblers draw 10
themselves by their nefarious trade is enormous. The
drain is so exhaustive that it soon empties the purses
of the victims and compels them first to borrow, until
they can borrow no more, and then to steal. Through
the Widber defalcation alone they drew into their
coffers $116,000 out of the city treasury, and that was
but one of the many defalcations caused by their so
called "sports."
In his protest against the resolutions Dr. Dille
pointed out to the Police Committee that Chauncey
Depew stated not long ago that the large business
failures, defalcations and embezzlements of the past
year have been wholly due to . racetrack gambling;
that $250,000,000 is spent annually in the maintenance
of the track gamblers, with their following of tout 3
and toughs.
It is to" be borne in mind that in the gambling the
public has no chance to win any more than just
enough to entice them to further gambling. The
Eastern sharpers did not come to California to en
courage horse-breeding nor for the benefit of horse
men. They came here to enrich themselves, by prey
ing upon the vices of the community. They arrange
the races so they can win, and they do win.
Against the amount of the investment made by the
Eastern gamblers, which Tobin regards as something
sacred, there is to be set the vast sums of money the
gamblers have already taken in from the city. Against
the $100 a day revenue to be derived from the li
cense must be set the cost of extra police work,
court trials and the heavy array of thefts from the
city and from private parties. Thus, then, waiving
consideration of the morality of the issue and the
deep concerns of honor and of life, the proposed
licensing of track gambling would still be a thing to
be condemned by the intelligence of the people, be
cause on Tobin's own ground of.finance it is a blight
and, a curse to the community.

When "The Christian" was performed as a drama for the first time at Helsmgfors, Fin
land, on January 26, 1900, the enthusiasm was so great that Professor Setala, who holds the chair
of Finnish literature in the town university, rose in his place and asked the audience if it did

weapons of all kinds.- It then provides that any con
cern engaging in trade in two or more of these groups
of articles is a "universal store" under the bill. The
tax begins to be levied on concerns with a turnover of
Â£25,000, and the annual tax which such a firm would
pay is Â£375. A business with a, turnover of Â£40.000
pays Â£625. with *a turnover of Â£60,000 a tax of Â£1100,
and so on.
It is said that in Germany^ the bill is regarded as
another illustration of the Kaiser's desire to govern
the affairs of the people in a paternal manner, but it
is not deemed of much importance. The proprietors
of the universal stores are not making much opposi
tion to it, and the belief prevails that should it be en
acted they will be able to take care of themselves by
compelling the manufacturers to pay a part of the tax
and the consumers the other part. It is also noted
that as the bill does not impose the tax upon stores
dealing in a single line of* articles, no matter how
huge it may be, it will be of little value in protecting
the small dealers after all: â¢ â¢
It is very well known that the development of uni
versal stores in all parts of the civilized world has
been due to economic law, and is based upon the fact
that it costs less on the average to produce or to
handle a large number of articles of a particular kind
than a small number. The object of the Kaiser in
seeking to interpose and prevent the operation of
that law in the domestic trade of Germany is reported
to be due to a desire on his part to preserve the small
trader as a social class. In the meantime the British
are watching the experiment with a good deal of sat
isfaction. The Chronicle says: "We doubt whether
such efforts to confine commerce within the lines of
a social ideal are likely to be successful in the long
run; but, nevertheless, we need not grumble at any
legislation which is likely to make Germany a less
keen competitor in our markets."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 4, 1900.
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.
IN the spring a young man's fancy seems to turn to
thoughts of orator}'- Colonel Bryan does not wait
for the buds to swell, but keeps in action the year
round. Just now his voice is merged in a great
chorus of speech-making that rolls over the continent
like a diapason of the spheres.
We are proud and happy to state that the one in
dividual voice that has recently been identified above
all the rest is the voice of a Californian. For the
time it so overgrew the whole choir as to make the
performance seem like a solo. It is needless to say
that the Californian was General Barnes. The Gen
eral interrupted his sentimental journey to New York
long enough to electrify the Union League Club of
Chicago on Washington's birthday. He was easily the
star orator of an occasion upon which oratory ap
pears and coruscates in constellations. The occasion
was a pro-expansion affair, illuminated by opalescent
dreams of glory and trade, and the General easily
carried off the honors and plucked the laurels to bring
home.
There was. however, one feature of his discussion
that passes beyond the interest taken in a speech
made by an orator who studies to please. Viewing
the balm-breathing islands that are now ours, lifting
their fronded palms in air from where the cross
hovers over Porto Rico to the shimmer of the cres
cent in the sunshine of the Sulus, the General clasped
them all and all their various breeds of people to his
bosom, which served vicariously for the constitution,
and with raised vision saw them sitting under the
shelter of the flag, panoplied with American citizen
ship and parading in that birthright which he pro
poses to share with them. Since Ossian E. Dodge,
in his tropical and erotic serenade, proposed to antic
up a tree for the bia's nest and to twang his guitar
where the mango apples grow, there has been no
more lover-like and generous proposition made to
the dusky sons and daughters than that flung upon
their necks like a string of jewels by General Barne3.
In its climax he exclaimed, "I do not know the race
that is incapable of American citizenship." The type
of the Chicago press seems to carry to the printed
page the gas heat of the casting process of a hundred
Mergenthalers in recording the "cheer after cheer",
that "rent the air" with a regulation rent at this ut
terance.
Getting down to cold, sober facts, we venture an
inquiry into the extent of General Barnes' ethnologi
cal knowledge. He goes abroad to declare the policy
of the open door of American citizenship to all races,
and uses it in an argument in favor of expansion
everywhere and on all sides. We are to take the land
into our domain and the people into our body politic,
for he knows of "no race that is incapable of Ameri
can citizenship." We file a demurrer, right here. To
be consistent the General must not wait for annexa
tion of a job lot of races. We have a variety on
hand and ready for experiment. Our own Indian
races were first on the ground and should be the first
to be escorted to the ballot-box. The negro follows.
He was once a slave, and is now a helot. The Fed
eral constitution, without lifting its fundamental
voice in oratory, a whole generation ago declared
him capable of American citizenship and endowed
him with it. But the ballot handed to him by the
supreme law of the land has been snatched from him
by his white partners in citizenship, and he attempts
to make effective use of his citizenship at the peril
of his life. Next in the line come the Chinese. They
are far up -in the scale of intelligence. They have
been long with us, but our laws declare them inca
pable of American citizenship and specifically exclude
them from the operation of our laws of naturaliza
tion. Will General Barnes come home to California
and advocate, personally or as a party measure, the
Chinese capability for American citizenship and start
a campaign for their legal admission to that privi
lege? Next are the Japanese, our more recent para
sites, who are already beginning to swarm in appre
ciable and unpleasant numbers in the midst of us.
Are they to join Hole-in-the-Air, Sambo and Ah Sin
in the harlequinade that will make an election booth
look like a museum of races? Next are the hybrids
of Porto Rico, all shades of color, from jet to jaun
dice, all as capable of American citizenship as Gen
eral Barnes himself I
Nor is this all. We have in Hawaii, Samoa and
the Philippines about sixty tribes, embracing every
race, from Polynesians to Malays, and sub-tribes,
septs, clans and factions ot more shades of yellow than
the robes of a Buddhist priest, but none of them in
capable of American citizenship and all to be made
equal in a black and tan republic that will be made to
look like a kennel filled with litters, running from the
milk white bull terrier, the spotted Dalmatian hound,
to the various shades of rat catchers and linked
sausage-like Dachshunds.
California will not pay a cent nor cast a ballot to
see the General's show. He may open it successfully
in Chicago, where its mere prospectus wrung "cheer
upon cheer" from his audience, but out here there
is less disposition to immerse American citizenship in
any darker dye stuff than has been heretofore used
to color it. A change of citizenship by consent, or
allegiance by force, works no change in racial char
acteristics. Oratory even cannot change the skin of
the Ethiopian any more than it can relocate the spots
of the leopard. If the witchery of General Barnes'
art could do this he could by oratory transform a
horse into a cow, or vice versa, and after a spin in
the park behind his favorite roadster milk him in the
stable and secure cream for the morning coffee. In
deed he could go further and charm himself out of
his known and well-beloved personality into that of
a Mandarin of the coral button or a Pasha of five tails.
He can do all these protean turns as easily as change
the racial nature of men, using a naturalization paper
as a poultice or a bleacher.

TUBE BLOWS OUT
OF TRANSPORT'S
STEAM LAUNCH
A Sailor and a Chinese Were
Slightly Scalded by the
Steam.

ganize on April 6 â Small Eire at
Drydock â Sugar Boats
in Quarantine.
â ?
There was considerable excitement
around the army transport wharf early
yesterday morning when one of the boiler
tubes of the transport Hancock" â¢ launch
blew out. No onÂ© was dangerously hurt,
but It did not take long for the -news to
spread along the front and in a short
epace of time It was authentically stated
that twenty men had almost been scalded
to death. Some of the injured sailors had
been taken to the Harbor Hospital. Some
were carried aboard the hospital ship Mis
souri and the rest were taken out to the
Hancock, so the reports said.
When the facts of the casÂ» were run
to earth it was found that only two men
had been scalded. One was Quon Jung,
the Chinese fireman on the launch,
and the other a tailor named C.
Keneflck. The latter was slightly
scalded about the knees and on
the right hand, but was able to walk to
the Harbor Hospital and then go to his
home at 2432 Mission street after Dr. Deas
had dressed the wound. Quon Jung had a
lot of superficial ecalds en the legs, arms
and face, but Dr. Deas says none of them
are- serious. Tom Kayer, cockswain of
the launch,* got a blast from the escap
ing steam, but his clothes saved him.
How the Mishap Occurred.
The launch was making her first run
from the ship when the accident hap
pened. -She was alongside the south side
of Folsom street wharf and about twenty
men had grot aboard to go out to the
transport. Just as the Chinese fireman
opened the furnace door to put In some
coal the tube blew out and the after part
of the launch was at once enveloped in es
caping steam. The men then began to
tcramble ashore as quickly as possible.
Officer Sylvester, who was on duty, quick
ly ran a gangplank down to the boat and
in a few minutes all were ashore. There
was another wild rumor around to the
effect that there was no water in the
boiler and that the pumping in of a fresh
supply caused the tube to blow out. Had
this been so the whole boiler would have
gone and carried launch and everybody
aboard with It- After the accident the
launch was towed out to the Hancock
by the tug Reliance. It is a new boat,
having been built by the Union Iron
Works about the time the Hancock was
overhauled.
The Port Wardens will be reorganized
next month. By April 6 all of Governor
Budd'e appointees will be out of office
and the men whom Governor Gage ap
pointed will have their seats. E. R.
N'ickell Is now keeping warm the chair
vacated by Senator Braunhart, Charles
Spear took the place of Captain H. R.
Atwood, who died in Oakland a few days
ago, and when Captain Provost retires on
April 6 Captain Walte will succeed him.
John Harrigan, who has made such an
efficient secretary to the board for many
years past, will in all probability be
elected to another term by the new Port
Wardens.
May Flint Lost Her Charter.
Owing to the length of time the May
Flint took In getting from Hongkong to
Tacoma she lost her charter. The big
four-master will now load coal at Seattle
for San Francisco and on her arrival will
probably get a grain charter for Europe.
The American ship I. F. Chapman ar
rived from New York yesterday after a
good passage of 156 days. Captain Carter,
who brought her into port, was formerly
master of the E. B. Sutton. The Chap
man made the run from 50 degrees to 50
degrees in twenty days and came from
the equator to port in thirty-five days.
The voyage was an uneventful one. The
Chapman brings a general cargo, which
she will discharge and go to Honolulu to
load sugar.
The bark Roderick Dhu arrived from
Hilo after a splendid passage of fifteen
days, beating the barkentlne Irmgard,
which also came In from the same port,
by five days. The schooner Robert Lew
ers also came in after a passage of
twenty-six days from Koloa. All three
vessels were placed in quarantine. There
are sixteen cabin passengers on the Rod
erick Dhu. -â¢Â¦;'*.
There was a small fire at the Main
street drydock early yesterday morning.
A caldron of pitch boiled over and it
was some time before it could be smoth
ered out. The fire tug Governor Mark
ham was called out, but her services were
not required.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company
has purchased the gasoline fishing boat

Big Seizure of Game.
Wild game of several hundred dollar*'
value was seized yesterday by Deputies
Vogelsang and Kercheval of the Game
and Fish Commission and turned over to
the" City and County Hospital and sev
eral orphan asylums for the benefit of
the Inmates. Early in the day the depu
ties obtained search warrants and on the
authority of the documents made a
search of the National Ice and Cold Stor
age Company's premises on Eighth and
Townsend streets. In the apartments
rented by Lemolne & Co. they found ISO
dozen quail and twenty dozen ducks. A
large number of grouse were found in
the apartments of Fodera & Co. This
is the largest seizure made since that
in the cold storage plant at Coronado.
The possession of wild game out of sea
son is prohibited by the law. which has
been upheld by several decisions of the
Supreme Court. In fact It is unlawful
for the storage people to have the pro
hibited game on their property.

Assessor Instructs Taxpayers.
Assessor Dodge has issued a circular
in which h.e informs taxpayers that when
the valuations of their personal property
are placed too low they will be subjected
to examination under oath with a possi
ble rerating. The law states that per
sonal property must be returned at Its
full cash value. All persons must file a
sworn statement and If one has no prop
erty to assess he must make oath to that
effect ; otherwise he is liable to be arbi
trarily assessed. All taxpayers are re
quested to make their statements prompt
ly on March 5 and return them to the As
sessor as soon thereafter as possible. v;Â¦

M. V. Morrison, alias Mumm, was sent
to the County Jail for eight months by
Judge Fritz yesterday. He stole a hand
cart, and when Policeman Royston ar
rested him he assaulted the officer. He
got six months for petty larceny and two
months for battery. At one time he was
bookkeeper for the San Francisco ! Gas
Light Company, but drink has ruined him
mentally and physically.
Sheehan Called Upon to Explain.
Auditor Wells yesterday sent a 'com
munication to former Tax Collector Shee
han requesting him to explain several er
rors which have been discovered in his
records. These errors consist in not hav
ing marked the taxes as paid on the dupli
cate assessment roll, when in fact tax
payers have in their possession the tax
receipts signed by one of Sheehan's depu
ties. Tax Collector Scott has discovered
a number of these discrepancies and un
less Sheehan can explain them satisfac
torily he may be called upon to deposit
a sum equal to the amount in dispute in
the city treasury.

MARDI GRAS BALL A
FINANCIAL SUCCESS
Artists Are Looking Forward to the
Spring Exhibition of the Art
Association.
The Mardl Graa ball given at Mark
Hopkins Institute last Tuesday evening
under the auspices of the San Francisco
Art Association was not only, a triumph
as a society function, but was a success
in a financial sensÂ©. The association
comes out with a profit of nearly $1500.
Next Monday the decorations will be re
moved to make epace for the spring ex
hibition.
The San Francisco Art Association was
never In a more prosperous condition. The
school of. design Is doing excellent work
and attracting students from every sec
tion of the Pacific Coast. The adminis
tration of Joseph D. Grant, president, has
been highly successful, and his successor,
who will be chosen within a few weeks,
will find it no easy task to surpass the
achievements of the outgoing regime.
The spring exhibition Mill open In the
hew gallery on Thursday, March 22, and
last one month. The exhibition will be
representative of the work of living Cali
fornia artists, and those who have been
identified with art in California. The
previous exhibition of a picture or other
work of art will not exclude It. Each
exhibitor may submit ten pictures. The
works of each painter will be grouped
by the hanging committee, and no one
exhibitor will be allowed more than
seventeen feet of space on the line In any
one section of the exhibition.
Exhibits will be received at Mark Hop
kins Institute until 6 p. m., Thursday.
March 8. Every work for exhibition must
be submitted to a duly elected jury for a
decision as to Its acceptance or rejection.
The hanging and placing of all accepted
works will be under the exclusive con
trol of this Jury and no changes will be
made in the arrangement nor can any
one work be withdrawn before the final
closing of the exhibition.
The reception for members of the asso
ciation will take place on the evening of
March 22. The public exhibition will be

CREDITABLE
APPRECIATION
The Prompt Response of
the Masses to Patto-
sien's Bargains.
BRUSSELS CARPETS 50 CENTS
Perhaps the best feature, like the
best foot, of any business enterprise
cught to be put foremost. Thus it is
that Pattosien'a have put forth the
enlargement, the improvement in
methods, in detailment of the im-
mense Furniture Exposition build-
ing, corner Sixteenth and Mission
streets. With this new year, this new
era in the true progress of the city,
Pattosien's ambition is not only to
keep up with the times, but to keep
a long way ahead of them.
Yes, Â¦with the improved machinery
in the manufacture of Parlor Furni-
ture, Couches, Mattresses, etc, which
â¢wras put in last year (so as to de-
velop, bit by bit, the possibility of
this expansion), this improvement re-
veals itself to the eyes and to the in-
terest of the Furniture-buying
masses.
Ahl but there is another feature.
The rise in lumber, the rise in oak,
mahogany, cherry and all the articles
that go into the making of Furniture
has been enormous, and, foreseeing
it, Pattosien's have filled up their
tig building, their warehouses to the
fullest capacity. Yes, acres of it â so
that the rise in cost of Furniture will
not affect any buyer at Pattosien'o
big store for at least another six
months, and places them at least 25
per cent below the lowest price Furni-
ture house in California.
These are a few features of this new
era which reflect great credit on the
management of this enormous estab-
lishment- For who gets the benefit?
You who get the bargains get the
benefit, you who get the Chamber
Suit and Parlor Suit, you who get the
Dining-room and Library Set, you
who get the Tables and Chairs, the
Carpets and Curtains, and the Bed-
ding and Blankets, you get the bene-
fit.
Pattosien's big Furniture Exposi-
tion Building, corner Sixteenth and
Kission streets, is open every day
from 8 until 6 o'clock. Saturday until
10 o'clock.

H. WEINSTOCK, the Well-
Known Sacramento Mer
chant.
SACRAMENTO, March B.â For some
months past H. Welnstock, a merchant of
Sacramento, has been occupying the pul
pit of the synagogue of the Congregation
B'nal Israel, one of the oldest temples of
worship in this city. During this period
Mr. Weinstock has delivered a series of
sermons, or, more properly, lectures,
which many of the congregation have not
locked upon aa consistent with the true
Jewish faith. It has been known for some
time that an element was growing in the
congregation which stood for a more strict
interpretation of Judaism than that
preached by the merchant In such ser
mons as "Jesus the Jew" and "Shall Jew
and Christian Intermarry?" Until now,
however, this element contented itself
with argumentative but none the less
pointed protest In the religious press oi
the Jewish denomination.
A step has at last ocen taken which
threatens to separate the followers of the
Jewish faith Into factions. Articles of in
corporation have been filed by the
Chevrah Tohras Moishe, the purpose of
which is set forth to be the holding of
prayer meetings In this city which are to
conform to the traditions and customs of
Israel and the* laws of Moses as Inter
preted in the Talmud.
In a statement In The Bee to-night M. S.
Wahrhaftig, attorney for the new organi
zation, asserts that the dissension is
mainly due to the extreme radical lectures
recently delivered by H. Weinstock in the
Eynagogue. Says Mr. Wahrhaftig: .
"The utterances of Mr. Weinstock have
for some time created a feeling of uneasi
ness among the Jews. With every suc
ceeding sermon he became bolder and
bolder. Last week's, for instance, was a
long-drawn interrogation point. The sub
ject was, 'Shall Jew and Christian Inter
marry?' The only conclusion the Jew
could gather from the sermon is that if
his or her Judaism might interfere with
conjugal happiness the remedy was at
handâ turn Christian. The same of course
applies to the Christian, whose remedy
under a similar embarrassment Is to turn
Jew."
It Is declared also that many of the
Jewish people of Sacramento desire their
children taught In Hebrew, and again that
while many are not orthodox they do not
credit Mr. Weinstoek's doctrines as even
acceptable from the standpoint of re
formed Judaism. It is only fair to remark
In this connection, however, that Mr.Wein
stoek's views seem to have met with the
favor of many Jewish residents, particu
larly among the younger generation/and
there is no doubt that should the new
organization open a temple a considerable
number will be - found ranged on both
side*. - Â¦ - .;..

HIGHWAYMAN
BAFFLES THE
BLOODHOUND
Covers His Tracks With
Pepper When Almost
Captured.
Officers Who Were- Pursuing Him
Obliged to Sleep Out All Night
j in a Pouring
Bain.
?
CALJSTOGA, March 3.â The stage rob
ber is still at large and his chances of
escape are pretty good. The dog tracked
him last night to within about four miles
of Oathill, and In fact was within about
400 yards of the bandit at one time. He
heard the dog barking viciously at his
heels and at once covered his tracks with
red pepper and the dog, after getting a
few whiffs of this refused to work any
further. The country is very rough and,
besides being very dark, rain commenced
to fall and kept up a steady downpour
until morning. With all this disadvantage
nothing could be. accomplished and not
even at daybreak could the dog take up
the scent. The officers slept out in the
rain all night in the thick woods, some of
them and the dog returning to town this
morning.
The Sheriff, District Attorney and Napa
Constables are still in the vicinity of Oat
hill and Paper Valley, and while still be
ing hopeful their chances of capturing
the robber are slim. The express box was
found last night about 100 yards from
the scene of the hold-up. The lock had
been blown oft with powder and all the
money, which is said to amount to $400,
was taken. A dollar and a bogus quarter
were picked up near the box. The box
contained quite a large sum in internal
revenue stamps, but these were not
touched.
It 13 now thought by the officers that
this is the same man who held up the
stage last September, as his actions are
very similar. He is thought to be an ex
pert at the business.
INDIAN KILLS
A WOMAN AND
THEN HIMSELF
Double Tragedy on the
Round Valley Reser
vation.
COVELO, March 3.â This community
was thrown into a state of excitement
this afternoon over a double tragedy at
the Indian headquarters in Round Valley
reservation. William Henry, an Intelli
gent half-breed Indian madly Infatuated
with a young Indian woman named Net
tie Smith, who was recently separated
from her husband, shot her. killing her
instantly, and after satisfying himself
she really was dead committed suicide
with the same weapon. Nettie was known
as Henry's mistress, but had threatened
to leave him.
The crime was committed in a build
ing known as the Brick House. Henry
and Nettie were the only occupants of
the house, who had temporarily taken
apartments there. The tragedy occurred
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. The reports
of the firearm attracted the attention of
Henry's father, who hurried to the house
and found both dead. Young Henry was
seen hunting in the woods early this
morning, and it Is believed that he re
turned about noon with an empty gamo
bag. wet and cold, as the room where the
tragedy occurred showed he had removed
his shoes and damp clothing. Some angry
words must have passed between them
to cause Henry to execute his oft-re
peated threat of shooting her should. she
desert him. Nettie must have thrown up
her hands to ward off the shot, as the
thumb of the left hand is missing. The
shot then struck the breast, passing
through the body and lodging in the wood
work.
Henry evidently hesitated long before
he became sufficiently nerved to make
way with himself, as her body was cold
and rigid when found, while his was
warm. From the position of Henry's
body, he must have placed the stock of
the gun against the fireplace casing, hold
ing .the muzzle in the direction of his
heart. He then stooped and pulled the
trigger, the bullet passing through the
body and embedding itself in the plaster
ing. The weapon used was a 41-caliber
Winchester. ,
Coroner Cummins, assisted by Comman
dant Llston, held an inquest this evening.
The jury found that Nettie was murdered
by William Henry, and Henry came to
his death by a gunshot wound, self-in
flicted. The testimony showed that Henry
had repeatedly threatened the life of the
murdered woman. Henry was only 19
years old and his victim was over 40. His
relatives at Lakeport, Upper Lake and
Sacramento have been telegraphed for.

ADVERTTSE2IENTS.
VERY FEW PEOPLE
Are Frea From Some Form of Indi-
gestioa.
Very few people are free from some
form of indigestion, but scarcely two will
have the same symptoms.
Seme euffer most directly after eating,
bloating from gas in stomach and bowels,
others have heartburn or sour risings,
etin others have palpitation of heart,
headaches, sleeplessness, pains In chest
and under shoulder blades, some have ex-
treme nervousness as in nervous dyspep-
cia.
But whatever the symptoms may be,
the caus<Â» in all cases of indigestion Is the
Â¦ame; that Is, the stomach for some rea-
son fails to properly and promptly digest
what is eaten.
This is the whole story of stomach trou-
bles in a nutshelL The stomach must have
rest and assistance and Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets give It both by supplying
those natural digestives which every weak
etomach lacks, owing to the failure of the
peptic glands In the stomach to secreto
eiifficient acid and pepsin to thoroughly
digest and assimilate the food eaten.
One grain of the active principle In
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or other whole-
eome food, and this claim has been proven
by actual experiment which any one can
perform for himself in the following man-
ner: Cut a hard boiled egg into very
email pieces, as it would be If masticated,
place the ef;g and two or three of the
tablets in a bottle or Jar containing warm
water heated to 9S degrees (the tempera-
ttire of the body) and keep it at this tem-
perature for three and cne-half hours, at
the end of which time the egg will be as
completely digested as it would have been
In the healthy stomach of a hungry boy.
The poir.t of this experiment is that
what Stuart's DyEpepsia Tablets will do
to the egg in the bottle it will do to the
egg or neat in the stomach, and nothing
else will rest and invigorate the stomach
so -safely and effectually. Even a little
child can take Stuart's Tablets with safety
end benefit If its digestion Is weak and
the thousands of cures accomplished by
iheir regular dally use are easily ex-
plained when it is understood that they
ere composed of vegetable essences, asep-
tic pepsin, diastase and Golden Seal,
which mingle with the food and digest it
thoroughly, giving the overworked stom-
ach a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neither
do pills and cathartic medicines, which
simply irritate and inflame the Intestines.
When enough food Is eatea and prompt-
ly digested there will be no constipation,
nor in fact will there be disease of any
kind, because good digestion means good
health In every organ.
The merit and success of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are world wide and they
are sold at the moderate price of 59 cts.
for full-sized package In every drugstore
In the United States and Canada, as well
as in Europe.
For the Information of those Interested
a little book will be mailed free by ad-
dressme F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall,

various forms or stomach weakness,
causes and cure.

BERLIN, March 3.â Herr Kunert, So
cialist Deputy, on Thursday commu
nlcftted to the Reichstag; a secret circular
of Minister yon Rheinbaben, Issued by t'ae
latter while he was Governor of Dusse!
dorf. In this his subordinates were in
structed to maintain a special attitude
with regard to American Consuls, and to
refuse to give them any information as to
the manufacture and sale of articles of

formation regarding any articles of com
merce, including toys.
The Incident has caused the greatest
sensation here. The Neueste Nachrichten
says in regard to it:
"It would be Interesting to learn \t the

Ministers of Commerce or Interior In
spired this circular, which affecta the In
ternational relations of Germany, or If it
was issued by order, inspiration or at leaÂ«t
with the knowledge of the Foreign Of
fice. The language in which the circular
was drawn up does not exactly bear wit
ness to the diplomatic training of the
writer."
I made Inquiries at the Foreign Jfflce,
but all explanations were flatly refused,
which seems to point to the fact that
Count yon Bulow was not a party to the
circular.

Scientific research discovers that the
life forces that make intelligent selec-
tion from food to build different parts
of the body, when ready to build and
rebuild the brain, seize upon the delicate
particles of Phosphate of Potash, which
is furnished in certain portions . of the
wheat and barley kernals, and setting
this element into active vibration uses
it to amalgamate with albumen.
This new combination is carried by
the blood to all parts of the body and is
absorbed by the nerve centers and
brain, to rebuild the delicate cells of
which brain is made, and which must be
renewed every day as the brain is used.
Use of brain burns up and destroys
small portions, of it, which .must be re-
built or "brain fag" results.

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, March 3.â
Senator Carter of Montana presented in
the Senate to-day a roemorial signed by
the Governors of Colorado, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana and Ari
zona, as follows:
At a conference held by the undersigned In
Washington, on the 22d day of February, 1900,
to consider the merits &f pending measures lor
the leasing and reclamation cf the arid lands
of the West by the Land Department of the
general Government, it was unanimously re
solved that. In view of the preat Importance
of the subject, especially in the effect of such
legislation uoon the people of the arid land
States and Territories, a conference of the
Governors of said States and Territories ba
called at Salt Lake City for the- ISth day oÂ£
April, ISOO, to discuss, consider and respectfully
report to Congress | a plan or method for a
satisfactory solution of the problem of the dls
ptsltton or management of the arid public do
main, In the general interest and for the gen
eral welfare of the -people of said States and
Territories, j , "y .
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
delivered to the Senate and to the House,
which are respectfully requested to suspend
action in the premises until the holding and
adjournment of the said conference.,'
Mr Carter said: "The communication
manifestly relates to the bill introduced
by the Senator from Washington (Mr.
Foster), entitled "A bill to provide for
public grazing lands and to produce reve
nue for agricultural development.
"This bill has excited widespread atten
tion throughout the entire Western coun
try wherever public lands are located. Its
purpose seems to be to lease public land 3
in large tracts to large stock owners for
a given rate of rental and for terms or
years. Likely to Pass.
"For the benefit of persons who have
become so profoundly stirred by this prop
osition before the Senate, it is but fair to
say that It is improbable that Congress
will at this late date consent to begin
leasing public lands in large areas to cor
porations and laige stock owners, thus re
tarding legitimate settlement of the pub
lic domain and giving that domain for a
trifling rental to a few individuals who
may desire to monopolize it. I do not
think that any apprehension need be reit
in any quarter with reference to the pos
sibility of passing such bill through^ the
Senate or through either branch of Con-
IresV The public domain of the Un'.ted
States has been held In trust by the Gov
ernment for the people of the country,
and actual settlers have always been pre
ferred. It has been the policy of the Gov
ernment to establish homes to build up
communities, to establish States and to
bring out well ordered society where
waste places exist. To turn what remains
of the public domain into cattle ranches
under barbed wire fences, with-a monop
oly of land and water. ln the hands of a
few individuals In the respective States,
*is not seriously entertained as a proposi
tion anywhere. I do not anticipate that
any committee of this body contemplate*
reporting favorably upon such a measure.
"This much I will cay, to the end that
well meaning persons who desire to settle
upon the public domain may have their
apprehensions quieted with reference to
any possibility of legislation on the part
of Congress on the lines of the bill re
ferred to.-' Â¦

SECRET SOCIETY FORMED
?
Jtany of Its Leaders Are Men Who
Pretend to Be Supporters of
the American AHmfTiiÃ
tration.
MANILA, March 3.â Reports reach the
Associated Press from various sources.
Including army ofScers and the head 6 of
commercial houses, with agents through
out the Islands, of continued activity
among the Insurgents, who are endeavor-
Ing to keep alive the armed opposition to
the United States and are planning to
continue the Insurrection with guerrilla
warfare on a larger scale when the rainy
season begins. A person holding a posi
tion second only to that of the Governor
General tells the Associated Press he is
convinced that the Insurgent organiza
tion has been remarkably rehabilitated
during the past month, particularly in
the northern provinces. He says the in-
Furpents have a secret organization pat
terned after the Katlpunan methods even
in the Ftrongest garrisoned towns, afford
lr.e perfect means of communication, and
that the machinery is managed from Ma
nila tome of the leaders being Filipinos
pretending to be supporters of the Amer
ican administration, many of the munici
pal eovernments installed by the army
forming part of the machinery-.
I*>yal to Aguinaldo.
Two correspondents of leading Ameri
ear. weeklies, who have traveled for a
month in Benrai and Ilcocos with letters
from insurgent chiefs, going alone fifty
miles from garrisons ajnd being every
where hospitably received, say the peOp!e
make no secret of their sympathy with
the insurrection. Though admitting that
the Filipino soldiers abuse them tbey still
protect these soldiers from the American
Koutinr parties. They claim to have
communicition with Aguinaldo. Paterno.
in the northern mountains of Man.la. is
full of civil and military officials of all
ranks of Aguinaldo's povernment. who
were captured or surrendered and who
were brought here and released on prom
ises to refrain from agitation.
While many of the insurgent municipal
officers were continued in office on taking
the oath of allegiance, residents who are
acquainted with them have little faith in
their adherence to their promises. All the
citizens of Tarlao. capital of the province
of that name, numbering eleven persons,
have been arrested and charged with
plotting, and two Insurgents have been
captured at Malabon with incriminating
papers and $4000 collected from the na
tives. Borne of the municipal govern
ments appear loyal and efficient. On the
other hand, one American general de
clares he believes that the majority in his
province are atrents of the Insurrection.
Pamphlets Circulated.
A fresh 'issue of Insurgent pamphlets is
being circulated, asserting that the Amer
ican promises of good government are
merely a mask for commercial exploitation
of the Philippines, quoting Senator Bev
eridpe's speech and an editorial from a
Washington newspaper headed "Let Us
Be Honest."
The trial of the guerrilla charped with
murder is finished, and it is believed the
commission's verdict will be guilty. In
dictments against others have been pre
pared. .
Xo report has been received from Gen
eral Bates' expedition. He haa probably
moved Inland, where communication with
him is impracticable. The army through
out the Island of Luzon is working hard,
scouring the country for Insurgents and
killing a few dally. The section from
Manila to Dagupan has been thoroughly
cleared, the scouting parties- being unable
to find any insurgents. General Funston
and Colonel Keenan took 200 men through
the mountains to Baler, on the eastern
coast, without meeting an insurgent. But
they are active along the northern coast
from Dasrupan to Aparri. Occasional re
port!" come of an American soldier being
killed or disappearing. . ..
In the southern provinces the Insurgents
continue to harass the American garri
sons by night demonstrations.
NON-UNION WORKMEN
ASSAULTED BY STRIKERS
Scenes of Violence Attend the Walk- j
out of Machinists at
Chicago.
CHICAGO. March 3.â Two non-union
workmen are being cared. for at the
County Hospital as the result of assaults
made upon them by a mob of strikers at
Canalport avenue and Seward street this
noon. They are L. S. Gondy and Aaron
Myers. Two other non-union men were
assaulted and badly beaten by strikers at
Sixtieth and Klmbark avenues earlier in
the day, and it was only when a woman
of the neighborhood came to the rescue
with a revolver that the strikers were
driven away. Warrants were sworn out
for tha arrest of the assailant of Gondy
and Myers.
Work was carried on with non-union
men by the United Contractors to-day,
and it was planned to send out many
more non-union wjorkmen on Monday.
In the strike of the machinists National
President O'Connell and Business Agents
Brown and Roderick were busy during
the day extending the defection of men to
the smaller shops. Nearly every shop of
importance in the city has been tied up to
some extent by the union. At the Deer
ing Harvester . "Works Superintendent
Kennedy said that only twenty-two men
had gone out, and it was probable that
the strike would have no noticeable effect
at the plant.
The Siemens & Halske Electrical Works
in Cicero did not close this evening, aÂ»
was expected by the strikers. Instead a
notice was posted announcing that the
firm was a member of the Chicago Asso
ciation of Machine Manufacturers, and
that the demands for recognition of the
Machinists' Union would not be granted.
It further stated that all employes could
return to work regardless of connection
with the unions, and that they would give
promotion, but no discrimination would
be made between union or non-union
workmen.

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, March 3.â
Senator-elect Bard arrived here this
evening. In his party were his sisters,
the Misses May P. Bard, L. K. Bard and
Blanche Bard of Chambersburg, Pa.
These ladies had met their distinguished
brother this afternoon at Harrisburg and
had accompanied him to Washington to
see him take the oath of office as Senator.
Other members of his party were his son.
Dr. Cephus L. Bard, and William M. Hlll
ikan, who is acting as his private secre
tary. Mr. Bard has selected as his per
manent secretary R. Woodland Gates of
Los- Angeles, whose long experience as
private secretary to former Senator
White will make him a useful assistant.
Mr. Bard and his party drove at once to
the Normandie House, where the Senator
will remain for the present. His son will
remain here several weeks. .
During the eveaing Senator Perkins and
members of the Callfornlan delegation in
the Hotfse welcomed the Senator to
Washington. The credentials of Mr.
Bard have already been presented to the
Senate and the oath of office will be ad
ministered to him on Monday.
Senator Perkins to-day called on Secre
tary of the Navy Long to persuade him
to recommend an appropriation by Con
gress for making repairs on the Marlon,
which is now used by the California
Naval Reserve. . The department holds
that Inasmuch as the Marion has been
turned over to the State of California for
the exclusive use of her militia all ex
penses of keeping her in serviceable con
dition should be paid out of the appropria
tion which that State presumably makes

SOUBRETTE ATTEMTS SUICIDE BECAUSE HER CLOTHES
WERE GIVEN TO HATED RIVAL.
LYDIA RAYMOND, a soubrette now performing at a local variety thea
ter, attempted suicide last night by stabbing herself In the body in her
room at the Berkeley house. 15 Mason street. That her
act met with failure is due to the dullness of the weapon. She did,
however, succeed In inflicting a number of painful wounds, and now
lies in her room sorrowful and penitent. The young woman is the wife
of "Billy" Murphy, a well-known Irish comrdlan, and because her husband
refused to remain under the same roof with her she took this means of end-
Ing her unhapplness. For the past week a marital difference had existed be
tween the couple, but her action resulted In bringing about mutual forgive
ness.
The trouble that led to the eeparatlon had its origin in Stockton a few
weeks ago. Both were doing a "sketch" and were meeting with unusual suc
cess. Mrs. Murphy was jealous of her husband's attentions to a young lady
who trod the boards In the GamÂ« theater, and, sad to relate, the husband
harbored the same feeling because of the smiles which his wife showered
on a resident of the Slough City. Both were at sixes and sevens, and at last
the repeated quarreling brought about a mutual separation. The wife hur
ried to this city and accepted a position at a local resort, while her husband
rrrnainc-d and finished his engagement. The wife In her hurry to get out of
her husband's presence forgot to take her wardrobe with her, and the hus
band, like a cruel villain in the play, wreaked vengeance by giving his bet
ter halTs lingerie, waists, skirts and all to her hated rival.
No end of writing could move her husband to send her clothes to her, so
Mr?. Murphy bided ncr time, and when her vengeful spouse returned to this
city the went before Judge Fritz, demanded and procured a search warrant.
This was Ferved by a big policeman and Mr. Murphy returned to his lodging
house in time to meet the bluecoat coming down the stairs with his trunk.
The comf-dian expostulated with the minion of the law, but to no avail,
and with deep sorrow watched his belongings depart for the police sta
tion. A* every article of wearing apparel he posseted in the world was
stored in the trur.k. Murphy found It necessary to lay In a new supply to
tide him over until the court decided ownership.
The coldness and cruelty of her husband so affected her that Mrs. Mur
phy derided to end it all. She procured a stout rope and tried to choke her
pelf. Failinig in this, ene resorted to a knife, but only succeeded in inflict
ing painful cuts. Word was sent to the would-be suicide's husband, and as
snon as he learned of his wife's plight he hurried to her bedside. Tears of
forsiver.ess were shed by each, reconciliation followed and the curtain was
rung down on a happy pair.

LOS ANGELES, March 3.â Sufficient
rain fell this morning to lay the dust.
The sun then broke through the clouds
and the weather continued clear through
out the afternoon. There are slight indi
cations of rain to-night in Southern Cali
fornia, but even if rain should fail it will
be of little benefit to crops, which In some
localities are past saving.
SAN DIEGO. March 3.â lt has been
cloudy to-day and the sky is heavily over
cast to-night, but up to 10 o'clock no rain
has fallen in this city. At Escondido to
day three hundredths of an inch fell.
SAN JOSE. March 3.â No rainfall was
ever more welcome than that which came
to-day and which has not yet ceased.
Wliile the orchards will receive great ben
efit, the gTain will be most materially as
eisted. Large crops are now a foregone
conclusion. In town the effect of the rain
has been shown in the increased business
done by the Cured Fruit Association.
Since noon fruit growers who had been
holding back, fearing a dry season and
a short crop, came pouring in to sign
contracts. There seems to be no doubt
that the requisite 75 per cent of the prune
acreage of the State will be secured, and
that the association will be on its feet by
the Ist of April. The rainfall for the
storm amounts to .45 of an inch; total for
the season 11.39 against 7.53 for the cor
responding season last year.
SALINAS, March 3.â Monterey County
in general, but Salinas in particular, Is re
ceiving a copious rain at present and all
indications point to a continued storm.
Reports from all outlying districts are to
the effect that rain came Just in time to
save crops. For the past two weeks the
weather has been very warm and as a re
sult much of" the grain has been badly
blighted, but if the rain continues it is
thought that the damaged crops will come
out all right.
PACIFIC GROVE. March 3.- s Rain has
fallen throughout this district since mid
night last night in a continuous gentlo
downpour. It la very welcome to farm
ers hereabouts.
JAMESTOWN, March 3.â Eighty hun
dredths of an inch of rain fell to-day up
to 6 p. m., making 20.33 inches since Sep
tember 1. Last season to date the total

Sagar it has been snowing all day. To

fidence.
NAPA, March 3.â Rain bÂ«gan falling
early this morning and continued through
out the day. It is much needed and wel
come.
PLACERVILLE, â¢ March 3.â A heavy
rainstorm, accompanied by a high wind
from the southeast, began in this section
at 1 o'clock this morning. The storm is a
very cold one and messages received by
telephone from the stations on the line of
the El Dorado canal report that snow is
falling heavily in the mountains east of
this city. This storm will be of great
value to the mining industry of this coun
ty, for it will insure an abundance of
water for mining purposes during the
summer months.
STOCKTON. March 3.â Rain has been
faling here all day, and reports indicate
it is general throughout the county,
though In no locality has the fall been
very heavy. It was welcome, however,
and some benefit will accrue wherever It
has fallen. Grain was- not suffering for
moisture, however. The indications are
that the storm is passing to the east.
TRACY, March 3.â The first rain In two
months began falling this morning. "While
crops arÂ« not suffering, rain is welcome.
GILROY, March 3.â A light rain has
been falling steadily since 6 a. m., with in
dications of a continued precipitation.
MODESTO, March 3.â Early this morn
ing rain began falling and this evening
the fall registered .46 of an inch. Total for
the" season, 9.39 inches. Grain was begin
ning to show ne*nl of moisture, but none
of It was suffering. Crop prospects could
not be better than at present.
PASO ROBLES, March 3.â After two
months the dry spell was broken to-day
by a good fall of rain, which commenced
at noon. Prospects are good for more
rain. All are jubilant, as a good rain
now insures a large yield of grain. The
amount of grain sown is larger than
ever before, and it is in splendid condi
tion, notwithstanding rain has not fallen
before for two months.
FRESNO, March 3.â This evening rain
began falling and has continued since in
a steady, heavy downpour. Up to 5
o'clock .01 of an inch fell, making a total
for the season of 6.23. The rain is badly
needed, and the present precipitation will
do a great deal of good. Rain is pre
dicted for to-morrow.
SACRAMENTO, March 3.â Rain fell
here for a few hours ihis morning. While
it was . not needed, it will not do any
harm except to strawberries, which are
now being marketed. The ground in this
vicinity has been too wet all winter.
MILTON; March 3.â Rain has been fall
ing since early morning, and the indica
tions now are for a continuance of the
storm. Grass and grain are looking ex
tremely well, and the present storm will
do much to insure a crop. â¢ <?;Â¦-â¢
SAYS SHE INHERITED HER TALENT
FROM HER PREACHER FATHER
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 4, 1900.
STUBBED HERSELF AND
THEN WON FORGIVENESS
MRS. LOUIS MEYERS.
MRS. LOUIS METERS, whose maiden name was Oza "Waldorp, Is well qual
ified by nature and training for playing 1 the parts to which she aspires â
ingenue. She is but a little over rive feet in height, well formed, blue eyed,
flaxen haired, and with voice, temperament and looks to correspond. She has
made the start and is determined to go on in her career, as she has met with
much encouragement in her several appearances this past week at the Califor
nia Theater.
Mrs. Meyers' father, the Rev. Mr. Waldrop. is the Baptist minister of
Healdsburg who caused such a stir among his flock and in the councils of his
church by his defense of the stage. It is said that he rather approves of the
course of his daughter, though she protests that he knows nothing of her in
tention. Â» ' *
"Papa should have chosen the stage instead of the pulpit for a profession,"
she says, "as he is a born actor and very dramatic at times in the pulpit.
From the time I was able to talk almost he encouraged and taught me to act
parts and was very proud of my Buccess. He is largely responsible for my
great love for the stage, and It is too late now to make me turn back."

Lutheran Ladles' Guild.
NEW YORK, March 3.â Because Benjamin Doblln. a Broadway tailor, did not
know the recipe for making a pair of Etage "pants," according to Edna
Wallace Hopper. hÂ» has been forced to bring the actress Into court to
collect/ what he claims to be a Just and moderate bill. Stage "pants," like
"artels', food,*' are a delicate creation. You Jlrst supply about four yards of
heavy srtflte outing cloth, stir In an equal amount of white China Ellk and
ftren^then Its taete with white silk thread, buttons and buckles. Crease thor
oagbly before serving. When the concoction Is finished It will be discovered that
the China ellk acts as a lining for the white flannel.
Bc-r.jan:in Doblin, tailor, forgot the China silk, but he did not forget to send
Mrs. llopp*r a till for $100. She complained that the trousers were useless to
her on account of the rldpes at the seams, and she sent them back as she would
n toupb sirloin at a Broadway restaurant. Then she ordered another set of trou
*Â¦< re from another tailor. All this occurred at the time of the opening of "Chris
arid the Wonderful Lamp" at the Victoria.
Now Mrs. Bopper is ready to leave town, and so, through his attorney, Wil
liam Klein. Benjamin Doblin. tailor, served a summons on the actress on Thurs
day right to appr-ar in the City Court and show cause why she should not pay a
tailor' f bill of $100 for two pairs of riding trousers. It took ;be process servers
two <iayÂ« to catch the actress.
She has referred the matter to a lawyer.
men of all parties and' sections and creeds and
races and nationalities, and Its stars are only
those of radiant hope to the remote peoples over
whom It floats.
Imperialism Impossible.
Thtr* can b* no Imperialism. Those who fear
are against it. Those who have faith In the re
public are against It, so that there is universal
abhorrence for It and unanimous opposition to
it. ThÂ« only dlfferenc* Is that those who don # t
agree with us have no confidence In the virtue
or capacity or high purpose or good faith of
this free people as a civilizing agency, while
we believe that the country of free government
which the American people have enjoyed Has
not rendered them falthlsxs and Irresolute, but
has fitted them for the great task of lifting up
and assisting to better conditions those distant
peoples who have, through the issue of battle,
become our wards.
Let us fear not. There Is no occasion for
faint hearts, no excuse for regrets. Nations
don't grow in strength and the cause of liberty
and law is not advanced by the doing of easy
things. The harder the tack the greater will
be the result, the benefit and the honor. To
doubt our power to accomplish it Is to lose
faith ' In the soundness and strength of our
popular institutions. The liberators will never
become the oppressors. A self-governed Â¦ peo
ple will never permit despotism- in any gov
ernment which they foster and defend.
Gentlemen, we have the new care and can
not shift It. And, breaking up the camp of
care and Isolation, let us bravely and hope
fully and soberly continue the march of faith
ful uerviee and falter not until the work is
done. It is not possible that seventy-five mil
lions of American freemen are unable to es
tablish liberty and Justice and good govern
ment in our new possessions. The burden is
our opportunity. The opportunity Is greater
than the burden. May God give us strength
to bear the one and wisdom to embrace the
other us to carry to our distant acquisitions
the guarantees of "life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness."

ern Pacific.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, March B.â Several of the pub
lic spirited, men of this city have eub
scribed toward the building of a fine large
first-class hotel.. This Is something Mer
ced has , needed ever since the closing of
the El Capitan Hotel by the Southern Pa

man avenue the same distance. It will oe
two stories high, the upper floor contain
ing eighty rooms, while on the lower floor
will be the office, dining-room, kitchen a:vl
several store rooms. The building will
contain a theater, which has also long
been needed. El Capitan is the name that
has been selected. It being the name of
the hotel the place of which it is designed
to fill as a first-class house. â¢

SPLENDID EVIDENCES OF
THE STATE'S PROSPERITY
WOOLEN MILL SOON TO
BE STARTED AT EUREKA
A- W. Berr Is the Projector and Be
lieves There Is Room for the
'.'l.'if Enterprise.
An effort is being made to establish a
woolen mill at Eureka, Humboldt County.
A. W. .Berr of this city, who was former
ly superintendent of the woolen mill at
San Jose, has Just returned from the
north, where he has succeeded in Interest
ing the people of Humboldt in the pro^
Ject. He received offers of several sites
free upon which to place the mill and
there also were offers of lumber to con
struct it.
Stock to the amount of $55,000 has been
subscribed in Eureka and $10,000 has been
subscribed in this city. This week Mr.
Berr will go to Eureka to incorporate the
new enterprise. Then lie will proceed
East to get the latest machinery and the
expectation Is that the mill will be in
operation very soon.
Mr. Berr cays that the cheap fuel to
be had In Eureka will be equal to a sav
ing of $25 per day ojs compared with the
cost of coal, which has been one of the
drawbacks with woolen mills in this
State. The conditions at Eureka were
carefully examined and all found to be
most favorable for wool manufacturing.
The county produces about 500,000 pounds
of wool annually. The representatives
of 350.CÂ«Â» pounds are In tne list of stock
holders, so that it is expected that there
will be an abundance of raw material
for the manufacture of blankets and
caeslmeres.

PRESIDENT KRUGER TO
MEET PRESIDENT STEYN
LONDON. March 3.â President Kruger
1b said to have left Pretoria with the in
tention of meeting- President Steyn. The
place where they will meet Is not men
tioned, but is believed to be somewhere in
the Orange Free State., Those in South
Africa who are conversant with the Â«ffect
the recenf reverses have had^on the Boers
express t!he opinion that the meeting of
the two Presidents is preliminary to a
suggestion of negotiations for peace. But
if this is the case it must be due to the
pressure brought to bear upon the Presi
dents by the burghers and Afrikanders
in the British colonies rather than the
personal inclinations of the Presidents, as
all the available information depicts them
as being as determined as ever to persist
in the war until the resources of the re
publics are much more enfeebled than
they seem to be at present, although some
signiiicance is attached to the consulta
tion in view" of the reported visit to Eng
land of Chief Justice de Villieres, Mr.
Hofmeier and Dr. Tewater ostensibly on
private business and for their health. But
the closest observers do not anticlpatt
any sudden cessation of hostilities, and
certainly the reports from the theater or
war do not tend to encourage the advo
cates of immediate peace. The Boers are
apparently rallying with their accus
tomed ability to repair a temporary re
verse, and Great Britain has yet to test
their force as a defensive power under
the new conditions of warfare.

citizens here last night, in which he spoke
of Governor Lind as a "blatant politi

with the Beers was prostituting his office
for votes. Governor Lind has been urged
to make complaint to the Federal authori
ties. He has declined, however, to take
notice of the incident. Morphy declares
that he is an American citizen and spoke
last night as an American citizen, as was
his right. He looks after the Consul's

SAN DIEGO. March 3.â Prominent capi
talists who are Interested in the advance
ment or the trade of San Diego have. It Is
understood, entered into negotiations with
a Los Angeles milling company for the
erection and operation here of one of the
largest flouring mills in this section of the
country. The mill and plant will cost
close to $100,000, and it Is to be erected near
the site of the Spreckels Brothers Com
mercial Company's warehouse, at the foot
of G street. A large portion of the block
on which the warehouse Is located is un
occupied at present, and being near the
water front and already supplied with
railroad tracks it would be an exceedingly
fine location for such an enterprise.
The large demand for flour in the Orient
and the fact that the steamers of the Cal
ifornia and Oriental line have had to go
north each trip for a partial cargo. has di
rected the attention of the people to the
possibility of supplying the Â¦ deficiency
here. The last steamer of the line out of
here had 1780 tons of flour from San Fran
cisco, and took . another 100 tons here.
More could be taken by each steamer if
space. did not have to be furnished for
cotton and other shipments.
The arrangements for the construction
of the buildings have progressed so far
that if the coming week brings rain to
Southern California the work of construc
tion will be commenced. If, however, It
Is found that wheat will have to be
brought here from the East there may be
a little delay in getting the work started.

SUPERVISOR THOUGHT
HIS VOTE WORTH A JOB
Tried to Hold Up the Tax Collector
for a Clerkship for a
Friend.
The officials in the Tax Collector^ of
fice are chuckling over the discomfiture
of a" certain Supervisor, who started out
on a still hunt \t or patronage a few days
ago.
At the last meeting of the Board oi
Supervisors the Tax Collector was grant
ed twenty-four extra clerks in accord
ance with the desires of Auditor Wells,
who holds that though the charter pro
vides specifically for the twenty-four ex
tra clerks it is necessary for the Super
visors to adopt resolutions to that effect.
The clerks are already employed In thÂ«
tax office, but the particular Supervisor
alluded to did not know this. He only
"knew that twenty-four clerks had been
allowed and visions of a sinecure for onÂ»
of his constituents floated through his
brain.
The next day he hastened to the tax
office and greeting Collector Scott In a
cordial manner, confided to him that he
had voted for the measure and thought
that to givÂ«>' him one of the clerks would
be about right. Scott good humoredly In
formed the Supervisor that he was labor-
Ing under a delusion.
"The clerks," said fcott. "are already
employed and Instead *of putting on any
more I have had to discharge two owtn?
to the fact that the former License Col
lector and hi 3 twenty-eight deputies were
paid out of our funds for their services
from January 1 to January 8, 1900. when
the new officials look office. I am very
sorry I cannot accommodate you. but call
atrain Mr. . I'll always be glad to see
you."
With this partln? shot Scott bowed the
city father out and the latter retired a
sadder but a wiser man. The identity
of the Supervisor *- not disclosed.

MORE HELP
NEEDED AT
THE MORGUE
Public Neglected While the
.Deputies Are Absent
on Cases.
COMPLAINT FROM POLICE.
Presence of a Matron, as Under the
Last Administration, Would
Serve to I>ispel All Dif
ficulty.
; There has been much complaint recently
owing to the scarcity of employes at tha
public Morgue. As matters stand at pres
ent the wide scope of work obliges tr-j
neglect of persons who have business with
the city's deadhouse. and the principal ob
jection made is that sometimes for aours.
while the deputies are called out on cases,
public business cornea to a standstill.
The deputies themselves are not respon
sible for this condition of affairs, and tl**y
do their best to attend to all matters ap
pertaining to their department. They are.
handicapped, however, and the only relief
for the situation Is to give them ample as
sistance that their work may be properly
performed. A matron who under the laiÂ»t
Coroner attended to the office whil"* the *
deputies were absent has been eliminated
from the staff, and the necessity of her
presence, not only as a substitute for the
deputies, but as a companion for wonw
who are brought by the force of unfortu
nate circumstances to visit the institution
when some relative or friend rests on a
slab within, has been greatly felt.
The corps of deputies is so small that
but two can be placed on the night watch-
In the daytime either the Coroner or fclJ
first assistant Is present. In addition to ta<Â»
regular day watch, and diClculty seldom
arises then. In the evening, however, only
two men take up their vigil, and wlierj
cases call them away from the ofSce th<*
doors are locked, the room darkened and
the public must wait. Ordinarily therÂ«Â»
are one or two calls for the Morgno of
ficials each evening. Fe-w cases come trom
point 3 closer than the City Receiving Hos
pital, and manytlmes the wagon is obliged
to go to residences In South San Fran
cisco or to the City and County Hospital.
Both deputies are required on each eaafr.
and no official remains on duty during
their absence.
When an unidentified body is brought t->
the Morgue many persons whose frterulÂ«i â¢
are missing call to view the remains 'n
the hope of getting a clew as to the
whereabouts of their lost ones. The even
ing Is chosen by most of the working peo
ple, and these have to be admitted to th*Â»
room In which the bodies are kept by on-*
of the deputies. While the officials ar<Â»
out on cases these people are obliged tQ
wait for hours or return to their homes,
thus delaying the Identification In many
Instances for days. A few days ago 3
complaint was n-.ade to Coroner Cole trar
during the absence of his deputies on a
call to the City and County Hospital an
attempt was made to turn away a party
of ladies who had come from Oakland at
the solicitation of the chief deputy for tha
purpose of viewing the remains oi .in un
known suicide, after having Just learned
their business, by misinforming them as
to the time when the deputies would re
turn. Â¦ .
In cases of death, either sudden or mys
terious, the police and public gen-rally
complain, as they are often obllge-i to
wait some time before they can summon
the Morgue authorities. No one is pres
ent to answer the telephone who has au
thority to act In an official capacity nntl
confusion arises. Undertakers, who have
orders for bodies, are Inconvenienced antt
additional grief is caused friends and rela
tives of the unfortunate.
One of the most serious results
may arise is the abuse of private nfor
mation which may be given by mistake to
persons who may happen to be present at
the Morgue during the absence of the
deputies. A telephone call which was an
swered by an outside party last week
caused much trouble, and threats wera
made that serious charges will be pre-

â¢raplSyes of the railroad corporation
trampling over one another in their eager
ness to be the first to Join the new al
leged benefit scheme are heard mutterlngs
cf dissatisfaction and threats of resist
ance to what Is regarded as a move on the
part cf Huntington to coerce them Into ac
cepting, his dictum In the matter of in
eurance.
An ominous cloud is gathering on the
railroad horlxcn. and unless the temper
of the men undergoes a decided change
the cloud Js likely to burst into a storm
that will eweep over the entire Southern
Pacific system, tying up traSc from one
end to the other In the greatest railroad
strike ever witnessed west of the Rocky
Mountains.
See Veiled Compulsion.
The men ccc In the circular only a. plain
eoimn&ad to join the relief department
created by Huntington. They regard the
phll&nthropic wording of the document
and the benefits to members which axe
co carefully enlarged upon as merely a
clo&k end a subterfuge to hide the real
purpose of the Southern Pacific's auto
cratic president. That purpose, it is
claimed, is to undermine and ultimately
wreck the railroad brotherhoods and de
stroy the last vestige of unionism among
the men, thus putting it beyond their
power to ever in the future offer any or
ganized resistance to the exactions of
their masters. This In itself is bad enough
to contemplate, and it is probably the
worst feature of the whole scheme in the
Â«yes of the railroad employee, inasmuch
as. if successful, it will place them abso
lutely at the mercy of the corporation.
Eut the scheme aims f.rst to compel the
men to pay a higher rate for their In
surance than they are at present paying,
Â¦while at the same time tht benefits prom
ised are less. Nearly all the railroad em
ployes in California are members of ber.e
r.t organizations, paying aa average of
SI 50 a month, which entitles them to sick
teneSts. The rate demanded by the South
ern Pacific Relief Department average*
i: TO a month, the exact figures ranging
from SO cents to $5 40. and ever}' employe
Â¦when vaa.k:r.g application for membership
must eign Â«â¢. paper releasing th<" Southern
Pacific Company from all liability for ac
cidents. This last provision offers an in
tErmountable barrier to employes who
might seek damages for loss of limb, and
has created much bitter comment.
Fear Loss of Employment.
The fact that the circular states that
menubership is voluntary in the case of
the presei.t employes of the company
counts for little. The men declare they
will be forced to join "voluntarily" or
Â¦wake up some fine morning to find them
eÂ«rlves out cf employment.
The employes of the railroad company
declare they will not join the relief de
partment. Thr -.jitter has already re
ceived a great .Â»al of attention anO
grievance corr.rnittees will shortly be
appointed to wait upon the railroad offi
cials and discuss the subject. From tht
temper of the men there is no doubt tha:
xr.ar.y of them will advocate a Etrike i:
an attempt Is made to force them to joic
the new order. The circular affects the
engineers, conductors and telegraphers,
Â¦who were not in the last Etrike, bu 
should another walkout occur they
â¢would. It Is claimed, be found In line with
their fellow employes.
A number of railroad employes called
t:pon Attorney George W. Monteith yes
terday to discuss the matter. In speak
ing of their visit last night Mr. Monteith
eaid the men were very much In earnest
end determined to prevent the consum
mation of the latest outrage proposed by
Mr. Huntir.gton.
"While the circular says It Is wholly
â¢voluntary' with the employes to Join or
rot. still ever}- railroad man knows tha:
that Is a mere subterfuge and that h:
â¢will have to join to hold his job." saiÂ«'
Mr. Monteith last night. "A great many
of the railroad employes who belong t<"
various fraternal orders will be com
pelled to give them up. as they cannot
Keep up the heavy exaction of this ' 're

The Men May* Strike.
"Will the men make any organized re
tistance." In other words. "Will they
strike?" was asked.
"They did not .tell me so In words, bu?
personally I have not th* slightest dour
that unless the railroad abandons thl;

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March J.â At this
morning's meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California Citrus Growers'
tariff committee much was presented to
encourage the members In the belief that
the battle against the ratification of the
Jamaican and French treaties would have
abundant fruit.
The fact that United States Senator
Perkins had introduced yesterday a peti
tion of protest signed by 15,000 Callfor
nlans and thirty-five commercial organi
zations against . the treaties received fa
vorable comment. The committee thinks
that the publicity the presentation gave
overrides the statements previously made
by Chairman Davis that few protests had
been filed from California, --â¢ Â¦ Â¦- Â¦Â¦:
This felicitation was heightened when
a telegram was received from M. J. Dan
iels, the delegate in Washington repre
senting the committee. Captain Daniels
says the California Congressional dele
gation yesterday stirred the Senate when
the solid delegation protested against the
treaties. Daniels further says the oppo
sition may have a majority vote but that
It lacks the two-thirds vote necessary to

has left its mark upon rich and poor alike.
The dreadful shame and distress of dis
honorable acts have entered exalted
homes as well as the habitations of the
lowly. Sadness and sorrow have come to
all classes alike, and the pastors of the
city are begging the Supervisors not to
disgrace themselves by submitting to the
gamblers.
It seems almost incredible that honor
able men should seriously consider the
proposed scheme, which has not a single
honest or reputable advocate to advance
its cause. - The -gamblers have taken no
pains to disguise their plans and their
hopes. They are boasting that they have
"fixed" twelve of the Supervisors. There
was a time when the "nxlng" of Super
visors was an ordinary business trans
action. Then it was that Supervisors had
a marketable value. They were quoted
on 'Change and were bought and sold as
cattle are bought and sold. It created no
comment then to declare that Supervisors
had been "fixed." but the champions of
reform have educated the people of this
city to a higher standard of public mo
rality.
. People believe now 'that' Supervisors
cannot be ."fixed," that .they are not for
sale and that they are honorable men who
resent a reflection upon Â¦ their personal
honesty. The boast of the gamblers there
fore that twelve members of "the board
have been "fixed" to vote for 'a measure
which is notoriously inimical to public
morals and policy shocks -the people of
this city more than it formerly did. The
gamblers' have been given a full and im
partial hearing. Indeed, they have been
greatly favored, for Supervisor Tobin,
who appears to be the only member of
the Police Committee of the Supervisors
having the right of independent action,
considers that the pleading .of men for
their homes and loved ones Is a huge joke.
The gamblers -have said frankly and
plainly that they are willing to pay San
Francisco *SOO for the privilege of preying
upon the city. Supervisor Tobin thinks
that the bird to be plucked is worth $4000.
but such a difference of opinion > is imma
terial. The loss. of one man's honor can
not be repaid by JSOO or $4000. . and ' San
Francisco has registered the disgrace and
utter ruin <tf scores of men and women,
whether more men and women are
to be dragged down rests with the Super
visors, and to-morrow the decision will
be made. : -
TO-MORROW the Supervisors will de
cide whether the people of San
Francisco are to be cursed by
the tvil of racecourse gambling. The
lesue is perhaps clearer than it ever
was before in the history of the
city. The measure which Supervisor To
bin has Introduced and which he will rec
ommend for adoption has no sponsor ex
cept himaelf and the gamblers. Mr. Tobln
has aeeured the public that horse owners
and horse breeders favor his resolution,
but he has produced nobody to support his
assertion. On the other hand, every de
cent influence in San Francisco is emphat
ically opposed to the resolution. Men of
&11 classes realize that the future of the
city la in danger and they will do all in
their power to prevent the perpetration of
the proposed outrage.
To business men the question presents a
serious financial problem. Through the
influence of the racecourse this city has
lost many hundreds of thousands of dol
lar* In actual thefts, robberies and em
bezzlemente. Employes in every depart
ment of trade and commercial life have
proved recreant to tbÂ£ir trust and have
aiesipated the money of their employers
on the racetrack and in the poolrooms.
Demoralization has overwhelmed many
bui>ineÂ«6 institutions, and merchants and
bankers have been forced to employ de
tective agencies to shadow the men In
their service.
Enormous sums have been expended by
the people in prosecuting men and women
who have fallen through the racecourse.
Eastern gamblers and blacklegs have been
Induced to come to San Francisco with a
hope of profit and ill gotten gain through
the track. The people of the city have
been made the victims of Â¦ the. cleverest
sharpers on the continent, and the result
has found expression in the reportn of vio
lent deeds and desperate acts. The mer
chants and the entire commercial commu
nity are united therefore in a protest
against the reopening of the track and the
revival of its gambling.
Equally vehement in their protest
agalnet the contemplated outrage are the
ministers and clergyman cf this city.
Neither class ncr creed forms a part of
this agltatloa. The evil of the racecourse
TWO thousand circulars, which arÂ»
likely to cause a clash between the
Chinese Consul General and the Six
Companies on one side and a number
of wealthy and influential merchants
on the other, were distributed
throughout Chinatown last night. In sub
stance the document accuses the two first
parties with dereliction of duty and makes
suggestions as to how the present high
binder war could be brought to a dose. Two
Important hints are given in the circularâ
,the first that when Chinese are arrested for
carrying, concealed weapons the Six Com
panies should prevent their friends from
furnishing ball money, employing attor
neys or paying fines; ar.d the second that
when highbinders are convicted for such
offenses they should serve a Â¦ long term
and afterward be deported to China. The
â¢xpense of such deportation, it Is claimed,
should be paid by the - Six Companies.
There are but thirty; or forty highbinders
who do murder in this city, and the en
tire expense involved would not amount
to more than 14000. Th* circular la anony
mous, except in stating that it was In
spired by wealthy merchants whose trade
has suffered by tong vars and who wish
to see peace reign.-
The Chinese Consul stated yesterday
that every assistance is being given to the
tongs against the Suey Sings to crush the
latter. They have â¢ terrorized Chinatown
for years, and now that odds 'are against
them efforts. will be made to stamp -them
out of, existence. The statement that tho
tongs of, the Sam Yups and See Yups
would combine and . engage . in open war
fare is ridiculed.. not only by the Consul,
but by every one conversant with Chinese
matters. While the =- warring tongs . are
factions of either, society, many of their
associate tongs are on friendly. term's and
have thus far showed a" disposition to
bring about peace. ; : ;. ,

the schooner Chispa, J. R. Savory of the
sloop Juanita, L. Q. Haven of the launch
Alberta and George D. Campbell of the
cutter Folly. Commodore . W. N/ McCar
thy was busy fixing gas rates and was
unable to be present. No business was
transacted. ->' '
On the same evening at the same place
the yachtowners o, the Corinthian Tacht
Club met to draw up a sailing programme
for the season and to discuss some propos
ed changes in the racing rules. Commo
dore H. D. Hawks occupied the chair and
offered a programme of events. The open
ing will be April 28, on which day there
will be a ladles' reception in the after
noon, with dancing and a variety enter
tainment. The ladles will return to the
city by the 5:40 boat. In the evening there
will be a Corinthian supper and jinks. On
Sunday the opening cruise will J-ake
place under signal from the flagship May.
On May 12 there will be a cruise to Val
lejo, returning next day, and on Decora
tion day the annual regatta will take
place over the channel course. Other
dates were arranged In their sequence.
The one-gun start was adopted for all
races and the racing rules of the club
were amended. The bridge will be raised
on March IS to let out the yachts and arks
which have been moored there during the
winter. The flagship May has already left
the lagoon and has been taken up on
Swanson's ways for a drying-out and gen T
eral overhauling. She will be stiffened by
the insertion of a. false keel. _ The .newly
elected board of the Corinthian
Club held a meeting on Thursday evening,
at which the business connected with, the
entertainment . recently given In Native
Sons' Hall in this city, was settled. The
net profits of the show are nearly $800.
E. C. Bartlett, recording secretary of
the San Francisco Yacht Club, has sold
tho yawl Frolic, which was at one time
owned by Commodore C. H. Harrison of
the Pacific Yacht Club. She was modeled
by Herrlck and built :by Somers, and.
though one of the oldest yachts on the
bay. was so well built, that when she was
overhauled last year It was not found
necessary to replace any of her Planks.
She has an over-all lengthy of 48:10 feet
and a beam of 16:03 feet. The purchasers
readily acceded to Bartlett s price and
will sail to- Cape Nome as soon as they
have provisioned her.

SCULLERS PREPARING
FOR ACTIVE PRACTICE
Anticipate Busy Season In Barge and
' Shell .Racing â May Change
; Lines of Skiffs.'
The Alameda Boating Club gave a suc
cessful dinner to about fifty of Its mem
bers last Saturday, at which a pleasant
time was enjoyed. Last Sunday was an
active day at the clubhouse and on the
creek, four barge crews and half a dozen
outrigger skiff men being out for practice.
The ciub * for some tund contemplated
making considerable additions to its quar
ters, which are- inadequate to accommo
date its increasing membership, but it has
been decided to spend its available funds
in getting more boats. Al Rogers, tha
boat builder, is of the opinion that a skiff
to be fast; ought- not. to have more than
three laps on the sides. He thinks that
six laps, as at present required by the
rules of : the Pacific Association, are too
many, as they must be much tapered at
bow and stern and are consequently weak.
So far as can be seen there is nothing in
the rules to prevent the seams being
lapped inside- the ' boat, thus leaving a
smooth outside: surface. John A. Ham
mersmith Â¦ and Herbert Randlett were
elected members of the Alameda Boating
Club at its last meeting. S. J. Pembroke;
the well known Alameda sculler, will closa
up his business in this city in about a
month and go to Cape Nome. He
already has a son at Dawson. F. W.
Ayers, stroke of the Alameda champion
barge crew, intends to enter for the out
rigger skiff championship this year and
expects to make A. \V. Pape and Dr. C.
C. Dennis work to retain their laurels.
The Olympic Boat Club will display
more activity this season than it has done
for some time past. Already, several mem
bers are going over to the Tiburon boat
house on Sundays, and Captain Charles
Letghton hopes to get together a crew
that can- do good work in the four-oared
shell owned by the club.. The Arlels also
proposo to take up shell rowing, and the
Pioneers have a four-oared shell in their
boathouse that has seen little service in
recent years. It is reported that the oars
men of Stockton are showing signs of
awakening and hope to send a good crew
to the Astoria regatta. This Important
aquatic event is held under the manage
ment of the Pacific Coast Rowing Asso
ciation of Amateur. Oarsmen, which was
organized at Astoria on August 24 of last
year. The president is G. C. Fulton or
the Astoria Rowing Club, and the board
of directors includes S. J. Pembroke, Dr.
Â£. C. Dennis W. C Espy. A. P. Roth
kopf John R. Bockman, George James
ana James Hopper. Â¦ â¢Â¦. p
The Ariel Rowing Club Is in" a prosper
ous condition, and If It has to seek new
quarters will build a handsome boathouse,
with a gymnasium and a handball court.
The club will probably be able to raise all
the money necessary for this purpose
among its own members without seeking
aid from outsiders. -

MATRON BANDY
ATTACKED BY AN
INSANE WOMAN
Kittie Peterson Planned to
Kill Her With a Heavy
Cobblestone.
Alarming Increase, in "Weight Drives
a Woman Violently Crazy and
Results in a Murderous
Attack.
â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 3.
Mrs. E. E. Bandy, matron at the County
Infirmary, was murderously attacked by
Mrs. "Kittle" Peterson, an inmate who
had suddenly become violently insane.
Matron Bandy had Just entered the wom
an's ward to look after Mrs. Peterson's
wants, when the latter delivered her a
Jslow in the face with her clenched fist,
felling her to the floor, and then securing
a large cobblestone she had secreted she
tried to kill the matron.
The commotion brought several attend
ants to the scene, and Mrs. Peterson was
finally overpowered. She was promptly
taken before the Lunacy Commissioners
Drs. Tlsdale and Legault adjudged her in
sane, and later Superior Judge Greene
committed her to the insane asylum at
Mrs. Peterson is about 60 years old. She
was admitted to the Infirmary nearly two
years ago and her affliction was most pe
culiar. She had previously enjoyed good
health at a weight of 150 pounds. Sud
denly she took on flesh at an alarming
rate and soon she tipped the scales at 2*o
pounds and her mind became affected and
has gradually been falling, while her
weight Increased.
HE WANTS HIS
PRESENTS BACK,
SO BRINGS SUIT
W. A. Brown Desires His
Land Returned by His
Hypnotic Bride.
Declares She Defrauded Him Out of
Half His Property and Much
Money Under Protestations
of Love.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 3.
After squandering about all his fortune
on the object of his love, William A.
Brown says that he has been the victim
of the hypnotic powers of Anna Marie
Whitney, whom he has presented to the
world as his lawful wife for over two
years. He is now satisfied that she Is
flickle and he wants his presents back by
way of a suit in the Superior ' Court.
The hypnotic romance of Brown's love
dream had its Incipiency in September,
1897, when he and Anna Marie Whitney
conducted a lodging house on Golden Gate
avenue, near Polk street, San Francisco,
where the innocent William furnished her
with every necessity of* life and, as he
asserts, "treated her in every manner as
his wife." And as for her, "during all
the time and up to September of last
year she expressed great love and affec
tion for him and his welfare." Frequent
ly, he declares, he promised to marry her,
and his love grew so strong under the
powers she exerted over him that last
May he executed and delivered to her a
bargain and sale deed for an undivided
one-half Interest In his Golden Gate ave
nue property. At divers times he also be
stowed upon her Jewelry and money
amounting to $6000.
In a suit begun In the Alameda County
Superior Court thla afternoon . against
Anna Marie Whitney, he says he made
the conveyance of part of his real estate
to her, "because of the undue Influence
and power exercised by her over him:
that all her expressions of love and af
fection for him were false: that at no
time did she have any feelings of love
or affection for him, but all such expres
sions and statements were made for the
purpose of fraudulently and wickedly ob
taining his property." ,
In his prayer Brown appeals to the
court, to have Anna M. Whitney adjudged
guilty of fraud: that he be given Judg
ment for the $5000 she has on deposit in
the banks and which money he claims is
identical to that he gave her. He also
asks that the court declare the Fruitvale
tract as being held by her in trust: that
all his gifts be revoked: that a receiver
be appointed to take charge of the per
sonal property, and that an injunction is
sue to prevent her disposing of any of it.
I. J. Truman Jr. and J. E. Segur appear
as Brown's attorneys.
ATTACKS ON
CITY ENGINEERS
STILL CONTINUES
Rowe Is After Clement and
Schaffer Out for
M.K. Miller.
President of the Council Declares the
City Engineer Negligent and a
Councilman Declares Miller
Incompetent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. March 3.
The bombardment of Consulting Engi
neer M. K. Miller and City Engineer R.
M Clement. In the line of battle now
waging at the City Hall, still continues
and there is no cessation to the hostili
ties. When the fight was in Its Infancy
It was so conducted one side would fire
a shot, and then there would be a few
days of rest, followed by a shot from the
other side. Now the bombardment is con
tinuous on each side, and there are Indi
cations that It will be brought up In the
Council on Monday evening and the courts
President H. D. Rowe of the City Coun
cil has been slugging City Engineer Clem
ent and accusing him of not finishing city
work and drawing money for work which
he was instructed to do but which he has
not completed. Mr. Clement replied, ex
plaining some of the delays as due to his
sickness, and asserting that his apparent
ly large fees were caused by the platting
of the annexed district for new sewers,
which was a large and expensive piece
of work. While this was going on. Coun
cilman Louis Schaffer was throwing shot
into the camp of Consulting Engineer M.
K. Miller, and Miller was replying as the
occasion warranted.
To-day President Rowe returned to the
bombardment with the charge that City
Engineer Clement has neglected his du
ties and a demand will be made at the
Council meeting on Monday that he shall
report the exact condition of all work
that has been ordered by that body. In
his letter to-day Mr. Rowe says:
My letter was not an attack ea Mr.
Clwnent. but â¢> plain statement of fact* to
refuu the statements of thoss who were
not pleased with the action of the City
Council In employing Mr. Millar as coniult
lnÂ«- engineer- Many were of thÂ« opinion
that It was all aa extra expense. I deslr* to
show that It Is economy to employ Mr. Mil
ler on a salary rather than to hayÂ« th* work
dona by the City Engineer and his deputies
under the feÂ« system.
My figures from tha City Auditor** effle*
show, that the amount of his bills for en
gineering work presented In the name of thÂ«
By EDWIN MEESE, Councilman Fourth Ward.
TO MY mind the question of bonds
or no bonds is a plain business
proposition. If the city of Oak
land is to maintain its place
among the "progressive cities of
this coast it must show the outside
world not only that it possesses nat
ural advantages, making It a desirable
place of abode for the retired gentle
man as well as for the merchant, the
artisan, the laborer, all struggling for
a home, but also that it is alive to its.
future possibilities and willing to con
tribute toward attaining the same.
The only question then" arising Is,
What can and should be done In this
regard? That nothing in the way of
"betterments" can be done with funds
received from the tax' levy has been
abundantly shown. I believe, to the
satisfaction of every taxpayer, the
only avenue open to accomplish any
thing: bein? the Issuance of bonds.
As to the nature of the Improve
ments for which bonds should be Is
sued, the contemplated sewers. Inter
cepting, continuation of main lake
from Adeline west, east side outlet,
etc.. appeal most strongly to my mind.
EDWIN MEESE.
perhaps because as chairman of the
Street Committee I have become familiar with thÂ» present condition.
The salt water sprinkling plant speaks for Itself. Any venture which will
return the outlay In a very few years because of the difference in cost from
the present system need? no urging.
Bituminous crosswalks will suggest themselves to every pedestrian, while
the merchant delivering his wares, the business man In his buggy, the wheel
men wending their way along our streets, will all be a unit for street Im
provements.
Oakland has never appealed In vain to Its citizens for funds to carry on
the educational department and the including of school houses and sites In the
proposed list will meet the approval of the public, while more engine houses
and sites are a matter of protection.
Our western shore offers splendid inducements for wharves. Had this been
taken advantage of in former years Oakland would now have competlns
railroads and would undoubtedly stand farther ahead In the ranks of com
mercial cities.
Could our voters, before casting their ballots for or against a new City
Hall, be Induced to take a survey of the interior of the building In which the
business of the city Is now transacted, noting the Insecure manner in which
records of Incalculable value are now of necessity kept (records which could
not be replaced in the event of their destruction by fire), noting further the
fact that ladies having business with the city officials are compelled to wade
through a throng of Police Court habitues, and still further noting the apol
ogy for a City Prison and the rooms of the Police Department. I feel confi
dent the ballots In favor of a new municipal bulldlntr would far outnumber
those against.
I have taken up the main propositions which might be Included In an
election held under the general Improvement bond act and claim that In all
these matters a vote for bonds means a' vote for progress. -X,
Municipal ownership of water works is an assured fact as soon as a cer
tainty of a sufficient source of supply Justifies the submission of this propo
sition to the voters. :. . , : EDWIN' MEESE.
WALKED TO HIS
DEATH BENEATH
HIS UMBRELLA
Frank King, an Aged La
borer, Killed by a Back
ing Special Train.
Gross Carelessness on the Part of the
Railroad Regarded by Friends
as Responsible for the
Sad Affair.
Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 3.
Frank King, an employe at the Judson
Iron Works, aged 60 years, was run
down and killed this afternoon by a
Southern Pacific special train that was
backing up from the Oakland mole to the
racetrack at Emeryville. .
The aged man had quit his day s labor
at the iron works shortly before a
o'clock, and. with his umbrella spread to
protect him from the rain, was walking
in a southerly direction between the rail
road tracks, near B street station. He
was bound for home, and had his um
brella against the wind and rain. He did
not hear the approach of the backing
train and was struck full force. His body
was horribly mangled. ,Â¦'â.
W. T. Burns, L. Alveres and Manuel
Ross, who were eye-witnesses to the ac
cident, state that a brakerhan was sta
tioned on the rear platform of the ap
proaching train and that he tried to sig
nal to the engineer to stop the train, but
all to no avail, and that before they could
apprise King of the rapidly approaching
danger or reach him to prevent its fatal
culmination the train was upon him.
They attribute King's death to the gross
carelessness of the railroad company In
backing Its trains from the mole to
Emeryville. -^
The body was removed to the Morgue
and Coroner Mehrmann has ordered that
an Inquest be held next Monday evening.
Deceased was a native of Portugal and
leaves a widow and several children re
sidinf at 38 Helen street. North Oakland.

as ha claims. Including his own and his
deputies' salaries the total cost to the city
was J&33 SO; and I repeat that, exclusive of
sawer plans for the annexed territory, which
he promised to present to the Council six or
eight weeka ago. and upon which he has
been at work more than six months, thera
has been no work of Importance to show for
all this money. The city records prove my
statement, and I challenge Mr. Clement to
deny It.
If Mr. Clement desires a controversy la
regard to his official acts I shall bÂ»
pleased to present to the public at least a
partial list of his shortcomings. Tha Coun
cil has tolerated his official nezlect until
patience has ceased tobea virtue, and now
that we have a large amount of engineering
'work which must be done In connection Â¦with
tha bond Issue and have employed a maa for
tha purpose. I do not propose that he and
his political and official supporters shall
-successfully Interfere with It. The Council
desires to submit the bonding proposition to
the people, and It appears that Mr. Clement
and his friends would tie the whole thing up
because he has not been given engineering;;
and I think I have shown good and suffi
cient reasons for not doing so.
H. D. ROWE, President City Council.
Councilman Louis Schaffer attacks the
proposed fee system for Engineer Miller
and attacks Miller as an engineer. He
says:
The Irrepressible tax eater. M. K. Miller.
Is again trying to tret another and a larger
hold upon the public treasury. HÂ« found
his hold at $290 a month upon tha public
treasury was slipping away from him. Tha
public as well as some of the Councilmen
were trying to break his hold, owing to the
extremely low ebb of the city treasury, but
he Is apparently not to be shut off. as ha is
advocating a fee system for preparing plans
and estimates for contemplated Improve
ments.
That Is a cood plan for M. K. Millar. HÂ»
would manage with thÂ« assistance of the
chief knockers of the city to mill dowa
from ISOOO to $10,000 with the pretense that
It would only cost J*CO or 5500.
Thla Is common history, as can bÂ« rerlSed
by hundreds of taxpayers, who were be
g-uiled by his Slppact statements, to hayÂ»
streets Improved In front of their property
that he said would only cost 13 cents per
front foot, but had finally to pay |3 SO. Soma
have threatened him with suit for tha differ
ence, aa he guaranteed the cost to be nine
tenths less than they had to pay. They
found that his ruarantees were about as
unreliable as the many statements that hÂ«
made on the platform at the last election,
when hÂ» was defeated by an honest, com
petent graduate for the position of City En
gineer.
I think the Council should decline to act ia
this matter until the committee of one hun
dred, composed of some of the bÂ«st and
most practical men In our city, who have
mors Interest In putting our city in the front
rank than they have In doinz politics and
providing soft soars for Incompetent polit
ical bosses.

WHIRLED DEATHWARD
ON A FLYING WHEEL
COUNCIL COMMITTEE TO
CUT THE WATER RATES
Income Allowed Only Upon the
Original Contra Costa Plant
Refuse to Recognize the Consolidation of
the Two Plants and Will Make a
General Reduction.
:. O&klaad Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway. March 3.
THE FlrÂ» and Water Committee of the
Oaklajid City CouncU held a secret
meeting last evening and fixed the
water rates for the coming year. But
the members of the committee pledged
each other that they would say nothing
about the new water rate ordinance until
It was presented to the committee of the
whole on Monday evening next, and so a
doee watch Is being kept In order that
the proceeding* may not leak out.
The Fire and Water Committee settled
one thing, as far as they are concerned,
that Is most Important. They refused to
allow the contention of the Contra Costa
Water Company that payment should be
made upca the combined Contra Costa
and IMngee artesian plants, and the rates
that will be reported by the committee
will be based upon the value of one plant.
The committee took for Its basis In the
fixing of the new rates what Is known
as the "original plant" â that is, the Con
tra Costa Water Company's plant, which
originally fumls-hed Oakland with water
ts.d which Is considered sufficient to fur
r.ish the town with water stilL The value
Of the artesian plant at Alvarado. which
has been absorbed by the Contra Costa
Water Company, was entirely discarded
and was not considered In the fixing of
the new rates.
When the water fight began this year
the Contra Costa "Water Company wanted
the city to allow Interest upon the amount
Invested In both of the plant* that they
now own and arguments were presented
by President J. H. T. Watkinson of the-
Contra Costa Water Company to show
that two plants were advantageous and
necessary to the city. This would have
nearly doubled the Income of the com
pany, for one plant Is considered nearly
â¢Â¦qua! to the other.
The Cret thine that the Fire and Water
Committee of the Council decided at their
secret session of last night was that they
Â¦would allow an Income upon only the
. riginal Contra Costa Water plant, with
<r-;ch additions and betterments as had
b*en made during the last year. Then tho
:":xing of the rates was proceeded with and
there was little difficulty in harmonizing
the opinions of the different members of
the committee.
Substantially the same form of an ordi
nance was prepared this year as last year
ar-d the came method of figuring water
rates was adopted. There were some ad
<-.:stmentÃ and changes made which will
amour.t to a cut In the aggregate Income
of the company, but to what extent these

WILLEY WILL CASE
FINALLY SETTLED
Supreme Court Benders a Decision
Upholding the Contested
Trust Deed.
The Supreme Court has. played havoc
with the decisions of the Superior Court
in che now famous Willey estate cases.
The estate was valued at over a quarter
of a million dollars, and since the death
of Mr. Willey many complications have
arisen. The disinherited son, who con
tested the will, was divorced by his wife
and ordered to pay alimony, and then
ended his life by the gas route. Three
cases ln litigation have gone through the
courts, and finally the trust bequests of
the elder Willey have been held valid.
Amasa P. Willey made a deed of trust
of all of his property, amounting to J300,
000, to E. W. Carpenter and Dr. William
Boericke. He also provided that his son,
Charles Walter Willey. should have J5OO
a year for life, but otherwise the son was
disinherited. The old man also made a
will to the same effect as the trust, by
which the proceeds of his property should
be disposed of to certain charities and
relatives. _
Upon the death of Amasa illey his
son filed a contest, claiming the trust
deed was void, the same issues being
raised in the Fair case. Judge Hebbard
decided that the trust was void and the
case was appealed to the Supreme Court.
Yesterday the Supreme Court decided
that the trust is valid, thus reversing; the
decision of the lower court.
Pending the appeal to the Supreme
Court Charles went into the Probate
Court and obtained a decision by Judge
Coffey that the will and deed were both
void. The Supreme Court also reverses
this decision.
Before young Willey died he made a
will leaving his property to Mrs. L. M.
Muirhead and others. This will was con
tested by young Willey's relatives, who
lost their suit, as the will was upheld by
the lower court. This, however, was a
barren victory/ for the decision of the
Supreme Court upholding the trust deed
wid giving the entire property of the
Â«&er Willey to the trustees leaves no es
taMk in the name of the younger man.

hung in most graceful and artistic folds

a large number of electric lights, which
added much to the effect. Pots filled with
peach blossoms set on the floor ana
around which the danuers moved In the

This celebrated medium, the clairvoyant of
all clairvoyants, who sees It all, tells you all
and Instantly gives you peace and happiness.
She never asks a question, but before you ut-
ter a word Bhe tells you In full of all that
you are Interested In, all dates, facts, etc. Sha
tells you who are true to you and who are
false, what hopes you may have of winning
your desires and what obstacles are In your
way and how to remove them; how to make
the best of your talents and prosper: how to
get meney. Bhe finds lost articles and locates
HIDDEN TREASURE.
Before entering info business, law, divorce or
marriage, consult me. Drive away evil spells,
stumbling blocks, bad luck and habits and
overcome all evil works, rivals and enemies.
Phe never fails. She baa brought about more
happiness than all other mediums. Others are
helped, why not you? If you are going to sea
a medium, why not see the very best? It costs
no more.

! out and how to make them successful; she pre-
i diets important events long before they hap-
, pen; In fact, there are no hidden mysteries so
deep that she cannot fathom.

IN COMPANYâ X. L., City. A husband
in speaking to his wife in company or in
public should address her as "Mrs." (us
ing her name). The wife should likewise
address her husband as "Mr." (using his
name). To style each other "My dear,"
"My darling." "My duck" and the like in
public is simply to become ridiculous.
Neither should address the other by the
Christian name In such cases, nor by the
initial letter, as "Mr. A.." "Mrs. C." but
use the family name, with the prefix
"Mr." and "Mrs."
COLLECTIVE NOUN-C., City. It is
proper to say "the committee report" and
"the committee reports." Committee i 3
a collective noun. Collectives as subjects
can have their verbs either in the singu
lar or the plural, the latter by preference
in familiar style; but usage varies as to
different words of this class, according
as they express) more prominently a unit
or a complexity. They take attributives,
however, In the singular, as "the commit
tee recommends" or "recommend," but
"this committee recommends."
A LATIN QUOTATIONâ PrITSita Stu
dent, City. The Latin quotation, "Ne su
tor ultra crepidam" â Let not the shoe
maker go beyond his lastâ was a censure
addressed by Apelles, a distinguished
Grecian painter who flourished In the
time of Alexander the Great, to & certain
cobbler who found fault with an ill-paint
ed slipper in one of his pictures; but
when he presumed to extend his criticism
to other parts of the painting he betrayed
so much ignorance as to elicit from the
painter this rebuke, which, freely trans
lated, means that no one should, presume
to give his opinion in a province of art
in which he is only a dabbler.
HER TRUE SENTlMENTSâSubscri
ber, City. This correspondent writes:
"For nearly two years I have been very
much in love with a lady (I of course
think her charming), and she says that
she reciprocates; yet, while being entire
mistress of herself and affairs, she re
fuses to allow me to call on her and she
very seldom calls on me, although our re
spective places are not more than a
stone's throw apart. What do you think
of her true sentiments toward me?" It
looks very much as if the lady's reclpro
cative feelings are not as strong as you
think they are, and if, during a period of
two years, she did not permit you to call
upon her, it is about time that you gave
her to understand that "there is Just as
good flsh in the sea as ever was caught."
DUTCH AND GERMANâ Dutch Is the
language of the Netherlands, as it is
called in America and Britain, but by the
Netherlanders it -is called Nederdultsch
or Nederlandsch. It is one of the Low
German language* or languages of the
Aryan family spoken in lowlands of the
Teutonic part of Europe, in contrast with
the High German of Upper Germany.
"Low Dutchman" and "High German"
are terms that are used only by those
who are ignorant of their application
when used in connection with the Nether
lands and Germany. They are used only
to designate the language of the two
countries, and the expressions arÂ« "Low
German" and "High German," the latter
expressing the highest and jpurest Teu
tonic language and "Low German." or
Dutch, that which is spoken In the low
lands.
HUMMING IN A THEATERâ B., City.
This correspondent has a grievance which
he sets forth in these words: "If & gen
tleman and lady who are well acquainted
should attend the theater and the lady
should persist In singing or humming
while popular airs are being played or
sung, would it be improper for the gentle
man to ask her to please refrain from
humming or singing, or indicate as much
by a slight movement of the elbow?" la
the first place no lady would be guilty of
such conduct, for it is not only an annoy
ance to her escort, but to all close to her,
for they undoubtedly would prefer to hear
the professionals sing or play than listen
to her singlnsr or humming. In such a
case the gentleman would be Justified In
reminding her, ia any gentlemanly way,
that such conduct waa very annoying, and
if she persisted he would be Justified on
some other occasion in taking to the play
Â¦ome one who would not slug and hum.
NATIONALITY OF SOLDIERSâ X. T.
M., City. There are no exact flgurea of
the nationality of the soldiers who served
in the Civil "War. either of the Federal
or the Confederate armies. Figures) have
been published, but they were only based
on guesswork, and therefore are not re
liable. In reply to a question in relation
to this matter submitted to the office of
the adjutant general of the United States
army, the reply was that no official com
pilation of nativity has been mads
and it cannot be made for the reason that
in the enlistments, in very many in
stances, the nativity of the men does not
appear on the muster roll of the com
pany. That being the case, the number
of desertions by nationality cannot be
given. The estimates of nationalities in
the Union army that have been given are
as follows: Native American, 1,523,3v0;
German,. 176.800; Irish. 144,200; British-
American, 53,500; English, 45,000; other for
eigners, 48,400; nativity unknown, mostly
foreign, 26,500. The total number of de
sertions were: Union army. 199,105: Con
federate army (partial compilation), 104,
428.

In the bid price of raw sugars, thus widening
the gap between the cost of raw and refined
sugars, was an influence. The movement In
these stocks had a sympathetic influence upon
other industrials, and there were general re
coveries from the opening weakness during the
first hour. A p-eriod of dullness and heaviness
succeeded while waiting for the bank state
ment, and upon the publication of that state
ment the market displayed increasing anima
tion and strength until the close, which was
generally at the top and Â¦ with net gains In
nearly alt stocks. Part of the buying was on
the principle that when bad news is out a rally
It due. But the return was, in fact, cot so
weak as had been feared. Receipts of cash
from the Interior were larger than anticipated
and the loss in cash correspondingly less. An
other loan expansion, so formidable as 53.C21,-
OW. was apparently viewed with complacency,
as the feeling has grown up In Wall street that
much cf the recent loan expansion will firjj
a quick return to the money market. So long
as call loans are made at 2g24 per cent there
will be no acute alarm over the money mar
ket prtEpects. v
The stock market this week has been torn
ty the conflicting influences of violent con
trary movements in different groups of stocks,
affected by Individual causes. There have
been sharp losses in the departments of indus
trials and so-called specialties, including the
stocks of corporations operating the New
York public utilities, and there have been
notable gains in some railroad stocks, based oa
large earnings reported.
The strength of railroads has at times
checked the fall In the Industrials, and at
other times the tudien breaks in the indus
trials fcave unsettled the whole market and
have been a drag en the movement In the rail
roads. Neither the gains, on the one hand, nor
the losses, on the other, have been fully main
tained, and it is impossible to determine the
dominant tendency of the market or to de
termine how far the apathy of the public de
mand for stocks would be changed if the mar
ket were relieved from the special disturbing
influences. The principal disturbing element
has been Third Avenue, which has sold over
SCi points lower than last Saturday's closing 1
price, and very nearly 200 points lower than [
the highest price of the corresponding period j
of last year. Such a development in a stock
long closely held and regarded as a safe in
vestment security has "an Inevitable effect on
other securities, however peculiar to itself
nsay be the circumstances which* affected it.
There were old rivalries and animosities be
tween bold and powerful speculative interests,
which the misfortunes cf the stock afforded an
opportunity to gratify. The long standing con
flict for centralized control of the New York
1 public utilities was- also iavclved, not only In
the movements of that group but through sym
pathetic connections of other stocks.* â¢
There has been furious j speculation In the
certificates of the sugar refining company,
based en ambiguous utterances of the presi
dent of the company that he should oppose
the payment of dividends unless the company
earned them. This riddle will not be solved
for the public until after the directors have
acted en the dividend next Wednesday, when
speculators will be able to foot up their gains
or their losses. The lroa and steel stocks have
iiro been a disturbing influence without any
very clear explanation beln? given of tbe large Â¦
selling of them. One current but not very j
plausible explanation is that the earnings of I
these companies are proving so large that {
; effective competition is invited and Is being
organized.
The reports cf authorities in the trade, show
ing large consumers- still halting over the
making of future contracts for material, ob
viously with the expectation that prices will
go lower, eeenr.i a more rational explanation.
These disturbing Influences have partly off
set but have not whclly prevented the effect
of the extraordinary earnings reported by
many of the treat railroads /or January. It
Is feared that the prices of material would so
far extend the cost of operation and rer<alrs
en the railroads teat their net earnings would
fall to be benefited by the large Increased
pross earnings. The statements published
during the j week effectually refute this sup
position.
Even where the actual cost of operating has
greatly Increased, the ralto of operating ex
penses to frross is so far reduced as to leave
handsome increases In net earnings. Su Paul
is an exception, owing, it is explained, to ex
traordinary Improvements charged to ex
penses. Taking the most striking examples,
the great Pennsylvania system of lines, dt
rectly operated east and west of Pittsburg, .
gains In January 7J per cent In net earnings
over last year; Atchlson, S5 per cent: Read
ing, a per cent; Erie, 44; Wabash, 42, and
Lfhigh Valley, 143 per cent.
The balance of earnings after deducting the
month's proportion .of fixed charges was In
creased over tenfold by the Cleveland, Cin
cinnati. Chicago and Et. Louis Railway and
172 per cent by Burlington. Wall street's
skepticism over the explanation that the re
cent enormous loan expansions by New York
banks h&s been taken out to meet commer
cial demands has been Justified by tbe news
developments of th* week. Special transac
tions have become known which account for
large loans, notably the anticipatory payments
by the Central Pacific of a J3.000.000 note to the
Government, the taking up by New York
capitalists of a lo&n to a Russian railroad
guaranteed by the Russian Government, said
to amount to 525.000.000, and the proceeds of
which are by the terms cf the lo&n to be ex
pended In this country, and large borrowings
by interior banks for the purchase of Govern
ments bonds, with a view of taking out ad
ditional note circulation under the provisions
of the new refunding law when It Is enacted.
It does not escape notice that even for Feb- j
ruary the national bcr.k note circulation has |
been increased some 82,447, 4 M. The British
successes in South Africa have resulted In
buying of stocks In New York for London ac
count, which, coupled with the urgent foreign
demand for cotton at the high price prevail
ing, has depressed the rate for sterling ex
change co that gold Imports are considered
within measurable distance. These consider
ation* must explain the comparative equanim
ity with which Wall street contemplates the
rapid Inroads r*-Icg made upon the surplus re
serves of the clearing-bouae banks. The mar
ket for railroad bonds ha* shown decreased
movement has been irregular. United States
new 4s advanced -!Â« and the old 4s and new is
14 per cent In the bid price.

The Lumber Market.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron for March says:
"The last twenty-eight days have been ex
ce'.ient ones for the Pacific Coast lumber cir
cles ar.S March bids fair to eclipse the record
cf the past one. Redwood receipts have been
numerous ar-d heavy alike from all three north
era counties, and current prices have been
f-rra. with a slight and apparent tendency to
nee. The market conditions amply Justify such
ar. action on the part of the manufacturers, but
the old competitive rale of indiscriminate cut
ting cf prices would Efain take its pernicious
hail on the local San Franrieco commercial
circles. It Is extremely difficult now fcr some
f the dealers ard manufacturers to abstain.
-st from force of previous habit: co perhaps
:: wiJl be Just as well not u> advance the exist-
;r.g price lisis.
"The redwood efclngle is taking up the even.
sssocth-rur.aing course of last year, and East
tra mijnr.ents through Newport Wharf aad
â unii^r Cotr.i^ny at Ana will be heavier
by r.ar.y '.....-ar.;! than la lilfi. Should tbs

pansion Is the ilogas &r the redwood . shingle
manufacturers, but It Is the development of
the markets of the Eastern Ur.lted States anl
not <j! the lately acquired Islands.
"The shlpmests cf pir-e, spruce and fir were
heavier even fcr crly the twer.ty-e'.ght days of
February than tfcev were la January and prices
are as they ruled In the latter month. There
must be an advance eocn in the lumber cf the
Northwest, If ociy to cover ttM e^-er-recurring
rise in fr^irht rate*, for the go; 2 excitement
cf Cape Nome and other extreme northern lo

Associated Banks' Statement.
TO SAIL.
NEW YORK, March I.â The New York Fin
ancier fays this week: A decrease of {6,037,000
In the surplus reserve of the clearing-house
banks of New York City for the current week
has reduced the excess cash holdinjrs to J13.641,-
KO, a shrinkage of more than $17,000,000 In one
month. The feature of the statement ' is the
continued rise In loans. The Increase for the
week In that Item has been IS, 621.000. : One
month ago the total was -455, C00. 000 lower than
now reported. This exceeds last year's record
very materially, although tne Incentive which
brought about the - IE9S . expansion Is lacking
now. The explanation for the rapid increase
In loan commitments lies In the heavy volume
of - commercial business which* the country Is
doing. .Lately there. has appeared another fac
tor â the absorption of Government bonds by
banksâ and > this accounts in part for the con
tinued addition to the ' loan item. ThÂ« banks
are etlll losing cash to the treasury. The state
ment reveals a decrease of 54, &07.000 In specie.
5767.400 for the week; This Is a little less than
had been expected, as the treasury had drawn
more than that during the week. The Inference
Is that the banks rained, rather than lost, on
Interior account.. The Increase of 53.050.400 In
deposits was much below the average . expan
sion over the past few weeks, and requirements
for additional reserve were not as heavy as has
been the case from week to week since the be
ginning of February. As It Is. the lessened ex
cess reserve for the past six days Is due almost
entirely to loss of cash from . banks, the de
posit Increase being responsible for only three
quarters of a million cf the total. Viewed as
a whole the exhibit of the banks is not aa un
favorable as had been anticipated, but it cer
tainly favors the prediction that money ratea
are now about as low as they will be for some
weeks to come. The money market in the Im
mediate future will be governed largely by the
amount which the banks will lose to the treas
ury, and the passage of the refunding bill may
also complicate matters temporarily. , The banks
are still adding to their circulation and the to
tal !Â¦ now in excess of ' any amount reported
during the last year.

Chicago Grain Market.-
CHICAGO, March B.â ln the wheat pit bull
ish feellwr was awakened early by the firm
ness of Liverpool and further encouraged jby
the strength of Paris and reports of a severe
frost in France. There was considerable pes
semlstlc talk concerning domestic crop dam
ages. The report of Statistician Snow making
farmers' holdings of wheat 40.000.C00 bushels
less than a year ago was also an Incentive to
buyers, who in some instances overlooked the
fact that, last year excepted, the quantity now
In reserve Is the largest since 1594. With this
encouragement and. backed by reports of 3)0,
000 bushels cash business done here yesterday
ehorts hurried to cover. Foreigners and the
Northwest were also buyers here and the trade
generally became animated. May opened a
shade up at EiHgSohCt touched 65Hc, and then
rallied to 65T4566C. The bulge was met by
profit-takings sales, which caused a break to
654 c, but , the market rallied ' quickly. May
ascended to Ce^t'cUc, and closed strong-, 40 to
He over yesterday at 65T4Â§65c.
Corn was heavy. Country offerings were a
bit freer from some sections. The estimate of
Statistician Snow making reserves of corn 151,-
OuO.ooo bushels over last year had a depressing
effect. Longs liquidated throughout the ses
sion. May closed weak, He to Uc lower at 344
631HC.
Oats were barely steady, the weakness of
corn having a depressing effect. The market
to-day was a small one. Cash oats have lm
rroved %c to He over May this week. May
closed unchanred at 23?j5134c.
Provisions enjoyed a j fair trade and held
steady. The corn weakness was felt somewhat,
but as packers were fair buyers and offerings
were not large the price did not suffer. May
pork closed 5c up. May lard unchanged and May
ribs a shade hlcher. Â¦ .

PICKPOCKET BURNS
CANNOT BE FOUND
His Case Called In the Superior Couit
and His Worthless Bonds De
clared Forfeited.
The case of James Burns, alias "Skln
ney" Ryan, the notorious pickpocket, was
called in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday,
and as he did not make his appearance
the bonds were declared forfeited and a
bench warrant was Issued for his arrest.
â¢ The bonds, as stated exclusively in Fri
day's Call, were accepted by Judge Ca
baniss on false representations ; made to
him by "James Gorman" and "Charles
Bishop," who qualified as sureties and
were found to-be worthless. The detec
tives have been diligently searching for
Burns, but he has gone East. Burns "was
a "pal" of "Kid" Young and James Mer
rill, alias Meehan, and It is peculiar that
each has escaped punishment for hi*
crime through being released on "straw",
bonds. â¢ Merrill was the first to escape
about five months ago. Young followed
three months later, and now Burns has
fled. It will, be a lesson to Judges. to be
careful In future in -accepting bonds for
pickpockets..*
