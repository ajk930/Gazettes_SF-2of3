SAN JACINTO. March 19.â A remark
able natural phenomenon has fol
lowed the recent series of earth
quakes that shook the southern end
of California. One of the giant
Fpurs of San Jacinto peak has moved its
millions of tons of^earth and rock into
the valley beneath, and where the valley
â¢was Is now a yawning abyss. Seemingly
It has sunk hundreds of feet inter a sub
terranean cavern which undoubtedly un
derlay this peak, once 4000 feet above the
eea level. ...
BÂ« it the effects of an earthquake or a
landslide, it is of such tremendous propor
tions as to benumb the Intellect for a
moment. There it lies eleven miles south
east of San Jacinto. a tumbled mass of
Â«>arth, 600 acres of trees and rocks, with j
Immense crevasses and cracks running
zigzag in all directions. There are Jammed |
neaks of sandstone where hills were torn
asunder: there are slanting precipice?
Â¦where the mountains parted company. In
other places are great funnel-shaped holes
Â¦w here the soil was sucked Into the interior
of the earth and spots scarce six feet
across run through with crevasses whose
depth the eye cannot fathom. .:" â¢--. ; >
The news of this great mountain slide
Â¦was slow in reaching town. The peak was
visited on Christmas day by Grant I. Tag
taxt forest supervisor and formerly clerk
of the Supreme Court of California, to
gether with Forest Ranger Rouse. Their
horses were tied at an elevation of 4000
feet to a manzanlta tree, and Rouse pro
ceeded to blaze a trail across this Iden
tical 600 acres to be utilized in case of
mountain fires.
Terrific Seismic Shock.
The terrific seismic shock that leveled
Fan Jacinto's brick buildings occurred at
4 25 on Christmas morning. At 10 o'clock
these forest officers saw the peak trem
bling and vibrating constantly with inter
nal rumbling, but as temblors had been
constantly recurring since morning the
men were not alarmed. They left that
particular spur after an hour s work. Mr.
Rouse lives about two miles below the
fountain, and although shocks were as
frequent as six each day he did not re r
member any except one which occurred six
days later at 1:31 p. m. At that time a
great booming as of blasting came from
The B pur above him and every dish In his
house was shaken from the cupboard
ehelves. He is of the opinion that this
was the date of the collapse, for clouds
of dust could be seen issuing from the di
rection of the mountain. The great
Christmas earthquake must have caused
the roof of the subterranean cavern to
split and. the constantly recurring tem
blors caused the mountain peak to blip
into the cavity. *
Mr. Rouse did not revisit the spur until
a few days ago. and when he sought bis
xnanzlnita tree at the head of the trail to
tie his horse to he found that the tree lay
uprooted fifty feet below over the edge of
a wide crevasse and the gently sloping
mountain aides lay In a Jumbled mass of
roots, rocks and deep fissures. The south
eastern edge, a half mUeaway, stood in
tact, but a long slant of blue shale,
smooth as glass, at. an Wangle of forty de
gTees, showed Just where the great masa
of earth had moved into the suddenly
opened abyss to the northwest-
Nature Turned Topsy-Turvy.
The temblors still occur weekly, and one
occurred last night. On Sunday every
body In this city drove to the foot of the
spur and on horseback completed . the
Â¦leep ascent on * narrow, precipitous
bridle patch to the scene. It is like climb-
Ing the Alps.'
Once there, however, the view that is
obtained â¢ well repays- the visitor for his
weary trip. What was once a gentle in
cline, running from a ridge' to a* small
valley, is now a cavern, separating the.
ridge from the valley. There are crevices
every few feet in the earth, some as, wide
as six feet and over twenty feet.^deep.
Bushes and small trees have been torn
up by the roots and - hurled .down ; for
many feet. In one place an oak tree
about fifteen feet high and three feet in
diameter was moved a 'distance of fifty
feet. The soil is so broken and cracked
that every few steps one is apt to sink
up to the knees. For three-quarters of a
mile all that can be seen is a mass of
upturned bushes and broken banks. What
were once the lowest basins are now the
highest.
Molten Matter Ejected.
But the most remarkable thing to be
seen on the tract is a half-mile-wide
stratum of ejected material. The composi
tion is black and of very fine grain. It
shines and Is even glassy. Beneath the
surface of this cryst^line rock, mica is
found. This is no doubt in Igneous rock.
A short time ago It was surely molten,
for beneath "the hardening crust It is soft
enqugh to be molded Into any shape with
the hands. Two or three feet below this
Is an intruded rock, coarser grained and
probably granite. This .condition of the
earth was first discovered on March 8
by D. W. Rouse. Â¦
There was some great heat connected
with the disturbance, f or'the earth on the
whole 500 acres has been rendered almost
Identical to ashes, and. every, sign .of
plant life has been visibly ' affectedâ in
fact, in most cases, killed.
the enormous and corrupt power of thÂ«
railroad behind him he not only failed to
accomplish the schemes intrusted to him.
but he submitted h!s employers to a hu
miliation worse than the exposure of de
feat. And in his place Jere .T.. Burke, very
well known and by no means 'unfamiliar
with the peculiar duties' of the position,
has been 'chosen." * ' "" Â¦*" " " .
This, revolution In the mauagenient of
the political affeJrs of the Southern Pacific
Company .will come, as a profound sur
prise to all but a vepr small clique of rail
road officials. * Several "months 'ago, when
Herrin's -blunders were' covering the rail
road with chagrin. The Call predicted the
significant ! change which has" now Â¦ been
effected.; Blunder after, blunder .was com
mitted by. Herrin. He failed to carry ou*
railroad plans at Sacramento, and he was
sent in defeat from the. Board of Super
visors. Stri'yinc. still to hold "his position,
he misrepresented the facts, led the rail
road company into an indorsement of an
extra session of. the Legislature, 'covered
if with the'; odium of Â¦ public contempt as
well as of defeat and. concluded an Inglo
rious campaign'with unenviable notoriety.
That was the climax,; and Herrm's-em
ployers resolved^ to â¢ remove 'him Â¦ from a
sphere In .which his activity had been any
thing but that^of usefulness. But It was
necessary to go slowly. . While Herrln was
a mammoth mistake as political manager,
making , enemies J instead lof friends and
recording defeats. lnstead of victories, he
could not be J thrown , out ' of ; th# railroad
service altogether, ; as he possesses rail
road ' secrets which at the present . time,
would ' make : highly interesting reading.!
So it was determined , to -take his yellow
Jacket away from: him piecemeal.
H. E. Huntington 'was .the -'diplomat
chosen, to .let Herrin drop easily, and the
nephew, it is admitted,, accomplished the
trick cleverly.- Huntington is, : by, author-,
ity of his uncle, the autocrat of the South
ern Pacific Company, on the coast. For a
long time he had been disgusted with the
clumsy 'operations of Herrin las political
manager.*; Over a: year ago, -Herrin, arro
gating to himself ?the, ownership of the
Republican; party,, promised ; the railroad
people that Burns should 1 be elected
United States Senator. : Herrln spent a
sack of : railroad ': money â¢ and Â¦Â¦ Burns ] was
beaten. .- - .;--.. ,'..*; . -, . . :
A series of defeats followed this big
failure. The â¢ Southern * Pacific Company
lost the "grip ; It had held upon the Super
visors of .this city for. years. -The "cork
screw" ' plot ? was ?'expbsed' and , the cora
nany retired in' the dismay of failure and
of i exposure. . The i: burlesque manipula
tions of ' : Herring with .the State .Board of
Railroad: Commissioners -made" the South
ern Pacific Company ;the laughing stock
of the State. 'Ap olitical clown sat In the
chair of .authority : and ; everything -he
touched i became a Jest. '/*.
: 'Then" came* the . fiasco . of the
extra ' session â¢ of I the " Legislature. . Herrln
persuaded .. Huntington ', that \. he h ad t he
votes > necessary ,' to i elect the I man from
Mexico a United States Senator., He was
so sure of his ground that he scouted the
idea" of skirmishing for Ja J second ' choice.
The (Southern - Pacific ; Company r believes
that icharity begins at home and 1 while It
wanted ' Burns It wanted more ' than any
particular aspirant \ any,- man , who i would
take his . orders ;f rom â¢ the " company^ ? â¢Â¦',
"But Herrln laughed! at -the thought'of
failure.', '- He had I the "votes,"* he; said.' and
nothing was ; left : but I', to " register " them.
So ? Gage i was /ordered * to"? call \ the r extra
session' and' the" result Is political ' history.
At a recent secret conference of Southern Pacific officials H. E. Huntington- carried Â» out -a. plan which he had al
ready .formulated. '.William! F. Herrln was deposed as political manager of the company and Jere T. Burke, assistant
manager of the Clearing-house' and secretary of the Los Angeles Electric' Railroad Company., was given his place. In
order- to' deceive, the public and to keep Herrln from an explosion of wrath in which 'he might, expose Southern Pa
cific methods and secrets Burke' will assume contror gradually, undertaking small contracts, assuming greater manip
ulations arid maklpg' progress Wtll he secures control. His first contract Is to . defeat John H. Dickinson In any polit
'." leal ambition . he may . possess*.' '.

40.000 men, with 120 guns. He will : thus
be stronger than the whole Boer army
now in the left field. His task will, be to
turn the Blggarsberg defenses .and then :
advance direct upon the Transvaal, oc
cupying the attention' of a large number
of Boers to the. east, while Lord Roberts
m,oves on Pretoria. By- that time* Lord

will have about 60,000 men and 200 guns.

Up to 4 o'clock this morning no definite

WILLIAM F. HERRIN t has jj at
â¢ last been deposed 1 as the head
of the' political bureau.of the
Southern Pacific -Company. - He
has' been shorn of his power to
manipulate the political schemes of the
corporation. ' He -will' have influence no
more to 'interfere: in the, politics, of the
State " or ; to. tamper i with': Legislatures ..or
Boards of Supervisors. He has been re

and of unfaithfulness upon him. With all
HUNTINGTON MAKES BURKE THE SUCCESSOR OF HERRIN.
Herrin had added the offense of deceit to
the crime of failure and his career as
political manager for the Southern Pa
cific Company was over. But the task of
removing, him was a delicate one. He
knows too much and the Southern Pacific
Company cannot afford at present to
drop^ him "altogether.
H. E. Huntington undertook the deli
cate, diplomatic task himself. He did so
with grim pleasure. He remembered the
day when his feathers of authority had
been plucked and only a lonely seagull
perched on the boat rail signaled bis de
parture. He remembered, too, the wel
come that had accompanied his triumph
ant : ret urn, and he decided to treat Herrin
in kind. . - - .
1 He called a conference of the wise ones
of the company, among them J. C. Stubbs.
Julius - Kruttschnitt and J. A. Flllmore.
Herrln himself was Invited to be present,
and understanding the virtue of a joke,
even on himself, accepted the Invitation.
The meeting, which the officials were cau
tioned to keep absolutely a secret, was. as
a matter of course, simply a formality.
Herrin's fate had been settled before the
conference took place. It had been decided
to take ' away : from him one by one the
political - prerogatives which he had
abused, to give him still the semblance of
power and to give to some one else Us
substance.
There was a double motive In thisâ to
placate and deceive Herrln and to impose
upon the public, to let Herrln remain as
the mark of criticism and have some one
else do the work of the company. At
the conference Herrln was told that he
had too- much to do and that It would bo
wise for him to' confine himself more In
future to his legal duties and to delegate
the delicate functions of political manager
to some one else. Herrin saw that his
peacock feather had gone and that a slash
had been made in his yellow Jacket.
Then a pretense was made of looking
for another man to perform the duties
which* Herrln had undertaken with such
signal failure. The search was short, as
Huntington had already chosen Jere T.
Burke, assistant manager of the Clearing
house'and secretary of the Los Angela
Electric Railroad Company. As a atrate
glc preliminary Huntington sounded tho
praises -of Burke, whom he knows from
that association which delicate manipula
tion of delicate affairs produces. Hunting
ton pronouncad Mr. Burke to be a very
virtuous man and. Incidentally, very valu
able. ' He possesses the tact of making
friends Instead of creating enemies, and.
of course, no reference, even Implied, wa*
made to -Hex-Tin. Â¦ -
; Mr. Burke. understands the route which
leads from a man's stomach to his brain
and Â¦heart, and knows how to -lift out of
the bottom of a wineglass that warmth of
feeling and good will which makes the,
other fellow, do 'as you want him to Jo.
Mr..' Burke gives good dinners; not the
kind that . Herrln , gave to the Railroad
Commissioners. 1 , but like those that on Â»
never hears a word about- And Mr. Burke.
Huntington said, combines economy with
generosity, as he does tact with Industry.
He has done some diplomatic service for
the company, and Mr. Huntington assured
his associates that Mr. Burkes expenses
never' exceeded $150 _ a dayâ a mere trtft-i
when one considers^ what Is at stake In
Southern Pacific- diplomacy. .

GERMANY'S ALLEGED APPEAL.
LONDON, March -20,-The Times, com
menting editorially upon the report that

antee the. safety of Johannesburg, say a ;
"We decline to believe that any respon
sible German statesman would make such

tion."
KRUGER'S ADMISSION.
LONDON, March 20.-A dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph from Bloemfontein g.iya:
, "In a speech which he made here a few
days before the British entered the town
President Krugtr admitted that his men
would be unable to keep in* the field for
another month."
estimate of Burke was made from the fact
that Burke had been uniformly successful
in everything he had undertaken. So
Burke was given the pÂ«acock feather. He
will have his office with Huntington, and
from that fountain of diplomatic wisdom
will^draw'his inspiration. Gradually he
will work his way until all the power of
Herrin is his and the name of that worthy
will be forgotten.
Burke is already Impressed with the re
sponsibilities of his new duties, and he
has decided to take up a town residence,
abandoning the home he has occupied for
a long time at San Rafael. He has told
his friends In secret that he must come
to the city, as his new duties Impose upon
him considerable night' work. Â¦ There is
no fun in Inviting a man to breakfast. It
is only at dinner that confidences flow
freely. Mr. Burke has also j delegated to
a subordinate the clerical part of his
duties as assistant manager of the Clear
lne-houso and as secretary of the Los
Angeles. Electric "Railroad- Company, re-,
serving of course the authority of super
vision in both cases. Thus freed from
hampering details he is ready to begin.
An.d it IS* perhaps natural that his first
important duty should be connected with
the locality which has been his home for
so long and where he has made so many
friends. He has been. ordered by Hunt
ington to defeat^ John- H:":. Dickinson in
every political aspiration 'he may ' : have
whatever it may be. Dickinson is at pres
ent the State Senator representing Marin
County and It Is understood i -that
he now "seeks election to the â¢ As
sembly". At the extra session of- the
Legislature he did not perform to the
satisfaction of Herrin and the Mexican
and has since been in the category of
traitors. For that reason Burke has, been
ordered to Instruct him in the blessings
of private life. It will be interesting to
watch with what success he proceeds in
the game. -
Interest will naturally be Increased
from the fact that Burke is a Democrat.
He served with distinction once.;as a
Democratic member of the Board of-Edu
cation, but he has been sufficiently liberal
to accept a non-partisan nomination.
Huntington has a pronounced liking for
Democrats and in deposing one Democrat
as political manager of Southern Pacific
affairs he probably meant, In choo"sing
another Democrat, to pay a delicate com
pliment to the party.
â¢Herrin's Democracy, however, will avail
him nothing. The only schemlng^whlch
he will be called upon to do in connec
tion with the Southern Pacific interests
â¢will be over legal briefs. His career as
political manager has closed and his suc
cessor has been chosen. â¢
That successor, however, as already^an
nounced, will not assume . his ? complete
duties at once. He will work gradually
Into the position which Herrln has: lost,
concerning himself, with small -deals at
first, gradually, working into largermanip
ulatl'ons and finally Into, complete 'control
of the bureau. >.This plan U absolutely
necessary to carry out the â.' orders : of
Huntingdon, enjoining *' absolute, 'secrecy.
Under no circumstances were the news
papers to obtain the secret, as, as it. was
feared that Herrin, - seeing # the trick by
which he had been deposed' and stinging
under what was expected to be ridicule
at his deposition, would fly into anger and
take revenge by ; r exposing some -of the
railroad secrets which he possesses. ; So
Burke will move gradually toward *pos-
Besslon of the yellow jacket.

BOWERS MAKES DENIAL.
Says the Story Told byRH. Benja
min Is Palse and Malicious. '
Special Dispatch to The Can".
SEATTLE. Wash., March 19.â Deputy
United States Marshal L. L. Bowers of
Unga, Alaska, one of the passengers on
the 111-fated Wolcott, emphatically denies
the . charge* of cowardice made against
him by Edward H. Benjamin in The Call
of last Saturday. Mr. Bowers states that
he had bis prisoners locked up because
it was expected that a landing would be
made at Karluk and Uyak that night.-
Furthermore, that the charge that ha was
the first over the aid* of the ship and
pushed Mrs. Mayon aside Is malicious and
absolutely untrue, as he was among the
last in the boat. - '
In an interview this afternoon with Cap
tain Snow, J. H. Rand and E. B. Wood,
first and /second mates of the Wolcott,
they . all declared that Benjamin's I story
concerning Bowers was without i founda
tion In fact, i Captain Snow states ; that
Mr. Bowers was one of . the most cour
ageous men on board the steamer, who
early volunteered his services and materi
ally assisted him In the hour Of peril.

LJXCOLN. Neb.. March 19.â 1n effect W.
J. Bryan announced to-night to the Dem
ocratic party and to the nation at large
the platform which he considers best fcr
the DemoÂ« ratlc party and practically upon
which he desires to stand if nominated a;
the Kansas City convention.
The platform, which was adopted by
the Nebraska Democracy with the great
est enthusiasm, reaffirms the Chicago
platform, declares for \"l6 to 1." op
poses a large ttandlng army, denounces
thÂ«Â» action of the Republican party on the
Porto Rico tariff bill, declares against
trusts and "Imperialism" and favors the
choice of United States Senators by popu
lar vote. The platform Is practically the
creation of Mr. Bryan. He did not write
it personally, but he was consulted con
cerning It, and before It was read to the
convention ha fcad approved It through
out.
The platform adopted by the Populist
convention was substantially the same as
that adopted by the Democrats. It differs
somewhat in fcrm but conflicts In no es
sential point.
Both conventions tcwlay were enthusias
tic for Bry&n to the last degree, and
every mention of his name was greeted
with cheers of delipht and approval. In-
Ftructions were given to both delegations
to stand for Mr. Bryan in the Kansas City
and Sioux Kails conventions.
The Democratic convention was called
to order at S:l5 by James Dahlman, chair
maii of the Slate Democratic Committee.
He announced that Thomas J. Nolan had
been selected as temporary chairman. Mr.
Nolan took the chair and the temporary
organization was made permanent. The
committ. 1 * on resolutions presented the
following report, which was adopted amid
great enthusiasm:
Democracy's Platform.
We. the Democrats cf Nebraska. In conven
tion assembled, do hereby affirm and Indorse.
In wh..le and in lart. in letter and in spirit,
the platform adoj.ted by the Democratic
National Convention held in Chicago in I^6.
We favor amendments to the Federal consti
tution specially authorizing an Income tax,
and providing for the election of United States
Senators by a direct vote of the people.
We o^Dose judgment by injunction and the
blacklist and f*vur arbitration as a means
of iwttliiut disputes between corporations and
their Â«-mi>lcyes.
We observe with approval the support given
by IÂ»enii>crats throughout the country to the
movement leaving them in the municipal own
ership of municipal franchises.
We favor the principle of the Initiative and
referendum wherever It can be applied.
We are in favor of liberal pensions to de
eervlng soldiers and to their dei>endents; we
believe that names upon the pension rolls
â¢shouid not be arbitrarily dropped, and we be
lieve, as stated in the last national platform,
that the fact of enlistment and of service
ehould be deemed conclusive evidence against
disease and disability before- enlistment.
We are in favor of the Immediate construc
tion nad fortification of the Xicaraguan canal
by the United States.
We concemn the Dingley tariff law as a
trura-breeding and extortion-inviting measure,
Fkillfully devised for the purpose of giving to a
few favors which they do not deserve and of
placing uiK>n the many burdens which they
should not bear.
We welcome the opportunity offered this year
to take t^e Federal Government out of the
hands "f the Republican party, which has
abandoned American ideas and American
ldealu anl at the command of corporate
wealth, has i,lmtted against the financial in
dependence Â«t the nation and menaced the in
dustrial independence of the individual, and
now contemplates the nullification of the decla
ration of American independence.
We pledge ourselves to wage an unceasing
warfare against all the trustsâ the money
trust.- the Industrial trust and the Interna
tional land grabbing trust. â¢
Sixteen to One.
Â¦ Instead of a system which would chain our
nation to the gold standard and compel it to
participate in disturbances which come to
'Europe, we <itmand an American financial sys
tem, made by the Anserican people for them
selves, to be secured by the immediate restora
â¢ tion of free and unlimited coinage of gold and
sliver at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1.
without waiting for the aid or consent of any
otfcer nation.
' The Republican administration has admitted
the gold standard to be unsatisfactory by ap
pointing a cummiKsiun to solicit foreign aid in
. restoring the double ptandard. and a Republican
Congrfss, even while trying to make "the gold
standard permanent, has confessed judgment
-against the standard by attempting to revive
the delusive hope of international bimetallism.
Instead of the system favored by the Re
publican party, under which national banks are
to be permitted to Issue and control the vol
ume of pajx?r money for their own oroflt, we
reiterate our demand for that financial sys
tem which re^ocnizes the Government's sov
ereign right to issue all money, whether coin
or pai*-r. and we demand the retention of the
greenbacks as they now exist and "the re
tirement of national bank notes as rapidly as
greenbacks can lÂ»e pulnstltuted for them.
We believe that private monopolies are in
defensible and intolerable, and we condemn
the national administration for its failure to
enforce the cresent law atrainst the trusts or
to rwommerd a more effective law.
We favor a Ptatf constitution which will
prohibit the organization of a monopoly within
this SWate and alÂ»o prevent a monopoly or
ganized Â«-lwwhere from dilng business within
the State; Â»<? further lxÂ»liÂ«>ve that Congress
rtiould supplement the efforts of the State by
legislation which will require every corporation.
DEMOCRACY'S CREED AS
DICTATED BY MR. BRYAN
Leaders Views Embodied in the Nebraska
Convention's Platform.
Sixteen-to-One Theory Reaffirmed and Trusts,
Imperialism and the Porto Rican
Tariff Denounced.
â before engaging in Interstate commerce, to
show that It has no water In Its stock and It
has neither, attempted In the past nor is at
tempting to monopolize any branch or busi
ness or the production of any article of mer
chandise.
Porto Eican Tariff Assailed.
In its platform of IS6O, the Renubllcan party
declared that the maintenance of Â¦ the prin
ciples promulgated In the declaration of in-
I dependence and embodied In the Federal con
i Ptltution (viz: That all men are created equal;
| that they are endowed with Inalienable rights;
! that governments are Instituted to secure their
: rights, and that governments derive their Just
t powers from the consent of the governed), it is
i wisential to the preservation of republican ln
1 Htitutlons, but the Republican party, under its
I present leadership, is endangering the preser
j vatlon of republican institutions by placing the
j dollar above the man In the construction of
government, and of violating the principles
; that It once declared to be essential.
\\> condemn the Porto Rico tariff bill, re
cently passed by a Republican House of Rep
resentatives, as a bold and open â¢ violation of
the nation's organic law, and a flagrant breach
ot faith. Â¦ - '
We fcssert that the constitution follows the
flag, and denounce the doctrine that an execu
tive or a Congress, created and limited by the
constitution, can exercise lawful authority be
yond that constitution or In violation of it.
Believing that a nation cannot long endure
half . republican "and half emptre. we oppose
wars of conquest and colonial possession.
The Filipinos cannot be citizens without en
dangering our civilization; they cannot be sub
jects without endangering our form of gov
ernment, and *s we are not willing to sur
render our civilization or convert a republic
Into an empire, we favor an Immediate declara
tion of the nation's purpose to give to the
Filipinos, first, a stable form of government:
second, independence, and .third, protection
from outside Interference, as it has for nearly
a century gl\-en protection to the republics of
Central and South America.'
We favor the expansion of trade by every
legitimate and peaceful means, but we are
opposed to purchasing trade at the cannon's
mouth with human blood; neither do we be
lieve that trade secured and held by force
is worth the price that must be paid for it.
We are In favor of extending the nation's
lnflu<~ice, but we believe that that influence
should be extended, not by force and violence,
but throueh the persuasive power of a high
and honorable example.
Opposed to Militarism.'
oppose militarism. It Imposes upon the
PÂ». j)le an unnecessary burden and is a con
stant menace. A small standing army and
well equipped State militia are sufficient In
time of peace; in time of war, the cltizen
soMier should be a republic's defense.
We believe, with Jefferson, in peace. In com
fnrt and honest friendship with all nations and
entangling alliances with none, and we regard
with apprehension the doctrine, advocated In
some quarters, that this nation should in Its
dealings or diplomacy show partiality toward
any of the European nations.
Not because of hostility to England, but be
cause we believe In the principles of a re
public and reject, as did our forefathers, the
theory of a monarchy, we sympathize with the
Boers in their attempt to preserve their
national Integrity. The failure of Republican
leaders, who four years asro expressed sym
pathy for the Cuban patriots, to feel an in
terest in the struggle of the Dutch in South
Africa, shows the paralyzing influence of the-
Imperial policy to which the administration is
now endeavoring: to commit this country.
1 While the committee on resolutions was
out -Richard Metcalf of Omaha, "W. D.
Oldham of Kearney, W. H. Thompson of
Grand Island and A. G. Tibbets of Lin
coln were chosen as delegates at large to
the national convention at Kansas City.
While the convention was In the midst of
a hot row over the choice of alternates to
the delegates at large Mr. Bryan appeared
in the hall. The sight of him put a stop
to all business, and' the delegates went
wild as he mounted the platform.
Speech of Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan's speech dealt almost entirely
with the three questions which he has
been discussing in various parts of the
countryâ the money question, the trust
question arid imperialism. He Charged
the Republican party wltn having .prac
ticed a deliberate fraud upon the voters
in IS&6 by holding out the hope of Interna
tional bimetallism when the leaders nei
ther expected nor desired the restoration
of the double standard, either by Inde
pendent action or by international agree
ment. Hie denounced the currency feature
of the financial bill and said that the Re
publican party had never in a campaign
advocated the retirement of the green
backs and that it would not be able to
defend that bill before the country. He
said that a national bank currency se
cured by the Government bonds could not
be a permanent settlement of the cur
rency question unless, we had a perma
nent and increasing national bank.
On the trust question he reiterated his
condemnation of the Republican party,
saying:
The trust is bo bad a thing that the President
felt it necessary to denounce trusts In his mes
-aase last year, but he did not recommend a
remedy. â¢
Taking up the Philippine question, he
referred first to the Porto Rico bill and
said:
The desire to impose duties on goods coming
from Porto Rico comoelled . the Republican
party to disclose its Imperialistic tendencies.
{This bill has aroused a storm of protest from
Republicans in public and In private life.
But why fhouU any Republican be surprised?
imperialism means that the people brought un
der the nag are not to share in the guarantees
of the constitution. It is amailni; that Re
publicans have contemplated the permanent ac
qulÃltion of the Philippine Islands without
stopping to consider the future status of the
Filipinos. Are tKe Filipino* to be citizens?
Are they to be allowed to come to the United
States with their Oriental methods of living
to compete with American labor? What good
does it do to exclude a few Chinese and then

Strife Among Populists.
The Populist Convention was somewhat
turbulent from the start. There were nu
merous candidates for every position, and
objectors to every measure. Roll calls
were frequent and consequently progress
slow. The meeting opened with a spirited
contest for the . position of temporary
chairman, which finally fell to W.-D.
Westover of Chadron. â¢ Â¦ . . â¢
The committee on credentials decided
against the claims of the middle-of-the
road Populists from Omaha to be classed
,as delegates and barred them Â¦ from - the
convention. * t Â¦-. .- ...
The position of D. Clem Deaver of
Omaha as member of the Populist Na
tional Committee from! Nebraska was de
clared vacant a"nd E. E. Thomas of Omaha
was chosen in his place. Mr. Deaver was
ousted for the reason that he "was not
considered a member of the Populist
party."
After having denied admission as'dele
gates to the Populist Convention' the
"middle-of-the-roaders" held a small con
vention of their own and appointed a 1a 1 Ne

OMAHA. March 19.â Rev. Charles W.
Savidge has Just returned from Topeka,
where he had a long Interview with Rev.
Charles W. Sheldon on church matters.
He said:
"Mr. Sheldon Is a ' very unpretentious
man, dresses simply but neatly, and car
ries a silver watch which could not have
cost over Jo. The Immense amount of
money which he has earned during the
past few years from his books' has been
almost wholly spent in building up his
kindergarten. Before the first edition of
the Capital had appeared Rev. Mr. Shel
don received an oiler from the Â£Â£ew York
World of a position as editorial writer oiÂ»
that paper at a salary of $15,000 a year.
He refused the offer.
"In speaking of his plans for the future
he said that he expected in. a short time'
to take an eight months* trip to Europe,
where he would study and rest. After
that he would return to this country and
establish headquarters in the East, from
which point he would make trips through
the country and establish 'Sheldon bands.'
These bands were to be non-sectarian,
and their object would be to lead lives
which would be guided by 'What Would
Jesus do?' This will necessitate his giv
ing up his church at Topeka."
Mr. Savldge says that while the Capital
could not continue as a newspaper in its
present form Mr. Sheldon's experiment
would undoubtedly result in a thorough
awakening of the public mind as to what
a newspaper should be and would have
a lasting result on the people of the coun
try. " - .

SENATORS DISCUSS
PORTO RICAN TARIFF
WASHINGTON, March 19.â Two meas
ures of national importance, and many of
slightly lesser Interest, were passed by the
Senate to-day. The legislative, executive
and Judicial appropriation bill, carrying
more than $25,000,000, was passed without
debate. The measure providing for the
appointment of a commission to adjudi
cate and settle claims of the people of the
United States growing out of the war
with Spain was also passed without oppo
sition. Â¦ ', r- v
For a brief time the Porto Rican gov
ernment and tariff measure was under
consideration. Mr. Foraker, in charge of
the ' bill, submitted ' some committee
amendments. A few of them were agreed
to, but the important ones are still pend
ing. A free trade amendment to the bill
was offered by Senator Beveridge. It was
as follows: "c"*>;.^
All articles coming Into the United States
from Porto Rico or going Into Porto Rico from
the United States snail be admitted free of
duty, but this act shall not be construed as ex
tending th"c constitution of the Unled States
or any part thereof over Porto Rico, and it Is
hereby declared that the constitution of the
United States Is not extended over Porto Rico.
Foraker then called up the Porto Rican
government and tariff bill for the purpose,
as he explained, of perfecting the. bill so
far as possible from the standpoint of the
committee, in order that a reprint might
be had of the measure. .
The first amendment suggested by For
aker related to the citizenship of the in
habitants of Porto Rico. As reported, the
bill provides that the inhabitants of Porto
Rico shall be "citizens of the United
States." The amendment offered by For
aker inserted some words after the term
"citizens," making the paragraph read:
"Shall be deemed and held to be citizens
of Porto Rico, and as such entitled to the
protection of- the United States." The
amendment was objected to by Bacon of
Georgia and went over.
Another amendment eliminated entirely
section 5 of the original Senate bill and
Insorted In lieu thereof the following:
The Commissioner of ; Navigation shall make
such regulatlona, subject to , the approval â¢ of
the Secretary of the Treasury, as he shall deem
expedient for the nationalization of all vessels
owned by Inhabitants' of Porto Rico on April
11, 1899, and which continued to be so owned up
to the - date of such nationalization, and Â¦ for
the admlrslon of, the same to all the benems
of the canting trade of the United States. And
the coantirs trade between the United Sta:es
and Poi io Rico Â¦ shall be regulated - with â¢ the
provisions of law. applicable to such trade be
tween any two great coasting districts. .
This amendment waa agreed to. After
some further amendments, principally
changing the phraseology of the original
measure, had. been offered, the Senate
held a brief executive session, adjourning

BLOCKS THE
PORTO RICAN
RELIEF BILL
House Refuses to Concur in
Amendments Made by
the Senate.
Republicans Vote Solidly in Opposi
tion and the Democrats in
Support of the
Changes.
WASHINGTON, March 19.â The House
to-day refused to concur in the Senate
amendments to the Porto Bican relief
bill. The Democrats supported a motion
to concur on the ground that It would
avoid further delay in extending relief to
the Inhabitants of the islands, but the
Republicans stood firmly behind Chairman
Cannon In his demand that the House
should insist on its original provision to
appropriate not only the money collected
on Porto Rlcan goods up to January 1,
1900, but all subsequent moneys collected
or to be collected. The remainder of the
day was devoted to District of Columbia
business.
Cannon called up .the Porto Rico appro
priation bill- and moved that the House
non-concur in .the Senate amendments.
McÃae of Arkansas moved concurrence.
Cannon explained the changes made in the
bill by .the : Senate which, he said, re
stricted the appropriations to the duties
collected to January 1. 1900. The House
provision appropriated also the duties col
lected after that date and those to be
hereafter collected. . The other change
made by the Senate, that designating the
purpose to which the money should be
he said, was only a change of form,
le House provision having left the expen
diture of the money to the discretion of
the President. â¢ '
Pell of Colorado advocated concurrence
in the Senate amendments, because,- he
said, the language of those amendments
distinctly assumed the installation of a
civil government In Porto Rico in the near
future. *
Ball Chides Cannon.
Ball of Texas said he waa astonished to
hear the gentleman (Cannon) move.non
concurrence in the Senate amendments.
When the bill was originally before the
House Cannon had appealed for "storm
swept, starving Porto Rico." Concurrence
would send to the island immediate relief.
Non-concurrence would cause delay. â¢Â¦ Ball
paid his respects to the "anonymoui Cab
inet officer" who some days ago attacked
as crafty politicians those who had re
fused to support . the Porto Rlcan tariff
bill He said he could hardly believe that
one who assailed others In such an under
hand way could be a member of the Cab
"Moody of Massachusetts supported Can
non's motion and said the conflict of the
two members had absolutely .nothing to do
with the question of free trade between
the United States and Porto Rico. >
McCleary of Minnesota, in advocating
Cannon's motion, declared that the Porto
Rican tariff bill proposed to treat the
people or the Island better than the peo
ple of any territory -of the United States
ever were treated. . *Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦
. Swanson of Pennsylvania denounced the
Porto Rican tariff bill as "Infamous" and
said the pending bill to give back- the
duties collected under the Dingley .-. law
was an Â» attempt to "sugar-coat the out
rage." . The power to fix the duties on
goods coming into and going from this
country was, the power accorded by Eng
land prior to the revolution and was one
of the main . reasons why the colonies
threw off the yoke.
Democrats Inconsistent.
â¢ Hemenway of . Indiana said the trouble
with the Democrats was they talked one
way and voted another. The Republicans
proposed -to deal with the situation in a
practical way. They did . not propose to
give the .Porto. Ricana free, trade and Im
pose . Internal revenue taxes upon ; them.
They proposed to give the ; people |of the
islands every < dollar heretofore , collected
under the Dingley law and every dollar
under the 15 per cent rates. ........ ; . Â¦?-.
.. Cannon said words were cheap. Action
was the ' material ; thing. * His motion was
designed to turn over, to the Porto Rlcans
every dollar heretofore and hereafter col
lected. The motion of McÃae was designed

WASHINGTON, March 19.â The Coeur
d'Alene investigation was resumed to-day
by the House Committee on Military Af
fairs, with J. H. Forney, special prosecu
tor at tho scene of the disorder, on the
stand. Representative Hay of Virginia
directed the examination with a view, of
ilisclosing how far the United States
troops were under the control and direc
tion of Governor Steunenberg and his ex
ecutive official in Shoshone County. Bart
lett Sinclair. Hay asked if General Mer
riam was the responsible commander not
only of the troops but also of tho affairs
cf the district in general. The witness
Bald General Merriam was not the respon
sible commander, as the Governor and
Sinclair directed affairs. To a certain ex
tent they controlled the United States
forces. Forney said that the troops were
tent there to aid in suppressing the insur
rection, and they did this by co-operating
with and assisting the State officials.
Hay paid that while he did not question
the right of the Governor to call for
troops or the right of the President to
tend them, he maintained that the Presi
dent had no authority to place the United
States troops under the control of State
authorities.
Questions by Lentz brought out that
Bartlett Sinclair was a civil officer under
the law, but that he exercised certain
military authority in order to make ef
fective his civil authority.
Forney stated that in his opinion the
trouble between the union and non-union
men in the Coeur d'Alene district was ir
reconcilable and that one or the /other
class would have to leave. Trouble had
been going on since 1692 and the camp was
too small to permit both elements to re
main in peace. Lentz sought to develop
that the union men were being systemati
cally driven out by the permit system, but
this the witness denied.
On redirect examination the witness
said that In his opinion, based on all the
circumstances coming under his observa
tion, the Governor was justified in pro
claiming martial law. Forney's testimony

WILL ADJUDICATE WAR
CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN
Senate Passes the Bill for the Ap
pointment of Commissioners
by the President.
WASHINGTON. March 19.â The Senate
to-day took up a bill to carry into effect
the stipulations of article 7 of the treaty
between the United States and Spain. It
provides for the appointment by the Pres
ident of three commissioners to receiv*,
examine and adjudicate all claims of citi
zens of the United States against Spain
which the United States agreed to adiudi
cate and settle. The sum of $50,000 annu
ally Is appointed for the expense of'lhe
commission, the life of the commission be
ing fixed at two years.
Davis, in charge of the measure, ex
pressed the belief that substantially all
the claims had already been filed with th"s
State Department, and they aggregated
about J20.000.000. '
An amendment proposed by Hoar was
agreed to, extending the time for filing
claims with the commission from s'x
months to one year after the organization
of the commission. At the suggestion of
Cockrell the right of appeal offered by the
bill, to both the United States and the
claimants, to the Supreme Court of the
United States was stricken out. The bill
thus provides for but one appeal, namely,
from the findings of the commission to the
United States Court of Appeals. As
amended, the measure was passed with
out division.

HOPES SENATE
WILL RATIFY
FRENCH TREATY
Davis Will Work for Its

Is Preparing a Statement Showing
the Advantage to American In

From Its Operation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, "WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March 19.
â Senator Davis, . chairman of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations in charge
of the French reciprocity treaty, said to
day that notwithstanding the purpose to
extend the time for the exchange of rati
fications, he proposes to do all he can to
obtain a ratification during the present
session. â¢
The Senator is preparing a careful
statement showing the advantages to
American Interests which will follow the
operation of the treaty. He expects to
complete his statement in the course of
a week and will. ask that it be printed, so
that each Senator may be supplied with
a copy and at his leisure consider the
beneficial results which it shows will flow
from its ratification. Senator Davis
will state that the French treaty Is a fair
bargain for both powers. Only In eight
cases has there been a reduction of 2t>
per cent and in no Instance to the detri
ment of American industry and labor.
The average ad valorem duty remaining
after several reductions (which apply only
to France) are sufficient to fully protect
the American producer.
The French treaty will expire In four
days unless an extension should be agreed
upon by the two governments. It is un
derstood that Secretary Hay proposed to

On the Verge of a Clash.
Reports have reached diplomatic quar
ters here respecting disturbances in Cen
tral America, which, show that Costa Rica
is in a state of complete preparedness for
war. Her troops have been placed in
strategical positions along the Nicaragua
frontier, under instructions to resist an
invasion either by revolutionary forces
under Senor Mora or an expedition organ
ized and dispatched by Nicaragua, Mora
1b said by some reports to have only a
.few followers, by others to have 600 sol
diers under his command, ajxd it has been
reported that he has 2000 men under arms.
The last report Is believed to be exag
gerated. It is the purpose of Costa Rica
to remain ready for war until she has re
ceived assurances from Nicaragua that
her soil will not be invaded.
It is understood that one of the objects
of Minister Merry's visits to Managua is
to Induce the Nicaragua government to
abstain from any act of hostility and to
assure Costa Rica that her fears are un
founded.
It is further understood that an alliance
in fact, though it is not certain whether it
exists on paper, has been formed by
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras, and
Costa Rica and San Salvador are bound
to resist together an act of aggression on
the part of the three governments named.
It is reported that San Salvador has en
deavored to effect an alliance with Mex
ico asainst Guatemala, and, therefore,
against Honduras and Nicaragua. Just
what foundation there is in this report
cannot be ascertained here. The authori
ties are not only desirous of ascertaining
if this report is true, but also if there is
any connection between it and prepara
tions which are being made for the con
struction of the canal.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March 19.
âIt can be stated authoritatively that the
State Department has been informed that
all of the governments of Central Amer
ica are opposed to the Davis amendment
to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. In the
opinion of the governments designated,
the amendment places an entirely new
pha^e upon the designs of the United
States in connection with the construc
tion of the canal. Neutrality of the
waterway would, to a certain extent,
have deprived the powerful republic of the
north of an incentive to .'inquire their ter
ritory. Since the war with Spain and the
consequent expansion of the United
States, some apprehension has been ex
pressed by the southern countries that
the United States would next turn it 6 at
lenticr. to them. The Hay-Pauncefote
treaty was, consequently, hailed by the
Central American nations as a guarantee
that they would' not be molested, as the
international neutrality of the canal
Â¦would prevent interference in isthmian af
fairs by other governments. The Davis
amendment, however, places in the hands
of this Government the right to not only
I take measures for Its own defense with
reference to the canal, but permits it to
use force "for the maintenance of public
order.' 1
"That is to 3ay." said a diplomat to
day, "supposing a condition to exist in
Central America such as is now reported,
the administration in power, desirous of
extending the boundaries of the United
States and of securing permanent control
of the waterway, could send an armed
force to Central America to maintain pub
lic order. And this force, on the-i>lea of
preventing a renewal of trouble, need
r.ever be withdrawn.
"Naturally the powers of Central Amer
ica object to the â¢ Davis amendment,
though they have made no official repre
sentations on the subject to the State De
partment. But while this> Government
Ing dally and he has handled them . all
with discretion. One thing is evident, and
that is that the Filipinos are in no condi
tion for self-government. If a civil gov
ernment were imposed it would need a
large military" force to maintain it.
"Several friends of Aguinaldo," contin
ued the Bishop, "called upon me in Hong
kong and told t me that they were satis
fled that thereVcould be no success for
his undertaking. The better class of Fili
pinos are satisfied that American occupa
tion means increased prosperity and are
not raisins any objections."
Bishop Potter told of a visit he made to
a factory in Manila, where about 450 Fili
pino boys and girls were spinning cotton
cloth. The overseer told him they had
learned to work the looms in about six
weeks, whereas Irish and Scotch children
took as many months before they were
of any service. The natives seemed to
take kindly to the confinement of factory
life, but they objected to the orders
against smoking in the factories.
Asked about the future of the Anglican,
church in the islands. Bishop Potter said
he saw no reason why it should not be
successfully introduced to the natives.
He had found, he said, no evidence of
any pagan religion. The Roman Catholic
religion was pretty generally observed,
and as education spreads the tenets of
the Anglican church will receive general
acceptance. Much of the good order ex
isting and the many manifestations of
good will to the Americans Bishop Potter
attributes to the high moral character of
the American soldiery.
NEW YORK, March 19.â Bishop Potter,
who has just returned from a five months'
tour which Included visits to the Philip
pines, Japan and India, talked to-day re
garding his Impressions. The trip was
made at the instance of the committee on
increased responsibilities of the Protestant
Episcopal church. He was most inter
ested, he said, in the condition of affairs
in China and Japan. He noticed a grad
ual friendliness between the two nations
and prohpesied that when Japan has
taught the Chinese the art of war neither
England, Russia nor Germany will decide
the fate of the East. The Chinese do not
love the Japanese, but, recognizing that
they have nothing to hope from the Euro
pean nations, are gladly establishing an
entente cordiale with the Japanese.
Referring to the Philippine " situation.
Bishop Potter said he went to the islands
in an attitude of antagonism. He de
clined to say if his opinions had altered,
but said he recognized the question as a
purely academic one.
"Whatever we might have done," he
said, "a year or more back, there is but
one thing for us to do now. and that is
to hold on to the islands and assume the
responsibility for their future. The mili
tary administration of the islands is be
yond praise. General Otis has not re
ceived half the recognition to which he Is
entitled. His position has been one of ext
reme delicacy. New questions are aris-

ANTI-TRUST
LAW OF TEWS
IS UPHELD
Decision Handed Down in
United States Supreme
Court.
JUSTICE HARLAN DISSENTS
Â»
Case in Question Was That of the
Waters-Pierce Oil Company, In
volving Its Bight to Do
Business in Texas.
WASHINGTON. March 19.â 1n tho
I'nited States Supreme Court to-day an
opinion was handed down In the case of
the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, Involv
ing Its right to do business in the State
of Texas, contrary to the provisions of the
State anti-trust laws of ISS9 and 1896.
It was charged, among other things,
that the Waters-Pierce Company waa a
member of the Standard Oil trust as or
ganized in ISS2. and various other allega
tions were made, but tho court did not
enter upon a general discussion of the
trust, contenting itself with" a discussion
of the Texas law as applicable to this
case. The opinion sustained the decisions
of the State court to the extent of affirm
ing them, and was thus opposed to the
contentions of the oil company, but It does
this on the ground that the State laws
imposed a condition which the oil com
pany had accepted, and hence was with
out ground of complaint.
The case involved the constitutionality
of the anti-trust law of Texas, which was
sustained by to-day's opinion.
The opinion was handed down by Jus
tice McKenna, who. reviewing the case.
eaid that the Waters-Pierce Company was
a private corporation incorporated In Mis
souri, which had begun business in the
State of Texas in liS9. The suit grew out
of the charges that the oil company vio
lated the statutes of the State of ISS9 and
IÂ£S5 against Illegal combinations In re
etraint of trade, thereby incurring a for
feiture of its permit to do business In the
Slate.
History of the Case.
The trial was first had In the District
Court of TravU County. In which the ver
dict was against the oil company. On ap
peai to the Court of Civil Appeals of the
State this decision was affirmed, and it
was brought to this court on a writ of
error. The basis of the action was the
Standard Oil trust, organired in ISS2. and
it was owned that its intention was to
control and monopolize the petroleum In
dustry of the I'nited States in various
subdivisions, awarding Texas to the Wat
ers-Pierce Company. The decision of to
day was based upon the propositions
which were submitted to the jury in the
original trial. Judge McKenna said:
The transactions of local commerce which
ttri- held by the State courts to be violations
of the statute provided in contracts with cer
tain merchants In which the plaintiff in error
required them to buy of It exclusively, and
from its other source, or buy exclusively of the
complainant in error and not to sell to any
person handling competing oils, or to buy ex
clusively from plaintiff in error and to sell at
a. price fixed by it.
The statutes must be considered In reference
to these contracts. In any other aspect they
are not subject to cur review on this record
except thf power of the State court to restrict
their rejrulation to local commerce upon which
a contention is raised.
Contract Violated.
He eaid the propositions raised by the
State courts had been broadly discussed
and many considerations transcending
them had been presented, relating to
grievances which do not enter Into the
case as affecting the oil company. The
court felt constrained to connne Itself to
this particular grievance. Stating this
grievance he said that It was that the
statutes of Texas limit its right to make
contracts and take away the liberty as
sured by the fourteenth amendment to
the constitution of the United States. Be
sides, it was asserted that the statutes
made many discriminations between per
sons and classes of persons. On this lat
ter point the court did not fpel called up
on to pass. The oil company is a foreign
corporation and its right of contracting
In the State of Texas was the only sub
ject of Inquiry- On this point the opinion
held that "the State prescribed the pur
poses of a corporation and the means of
executing those purposes."
In this cape the oil company could not
claim an exemption from the principle
"on the ground that the permit of the
company was a contract Inviolable
against subsequent legislation by the
State. The statute of ISS9 waa a condition
upon the plaintiff In error, within the
power of the State to Impose, and Â¦what
ever its limitations Â¦were upon the power
of contracting, whatever Its discrimina
tions were, they became conditions of the
permit and were accepted with it. The
statute was not repealed by the act of 1835.
The only substantial addition made by
the latter act was to exclude from its
provisions organizations of laborers for
the purpose of maintaining a standard of
wages.
Question of Constitutionality.
Further, as to the act of IS&S, he said:
"It is either constitutional or unconstitu
tional. If It Is constitutional, the plaintiff
in error has no legal cause to complain
of It. If unconstitutional it does not af
fect the act of 1839 and that, as we have
Feen. imposes valid conditions upon these
plaintiffs In <Â»rror and their violation sub
jected its permit to do business in the
State to forfeiture." . .
Justice Harlan dissented from the
opinion.

Nob Hill Property Wanted
by Florence Blythe- j
Moore. *
Price Offered Said to Be About Three
Hundred Thousand Dollarsâ Flood
May Sell the Baldwin Hotel
Site.
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Moore is negotiat
ing for the purchase of the block of land
owned by the Fair estate on Nob Hill,
bounded by California, Powell, Sacra
mento and Mason streets, and It is
rumored that she contemplates the erec
tion thereon of a splendid residence. It
cannot be said definitely that Mrs. Blytho-
Moore Intends establishing herself among
the nabobs on the hill in a house of her
own. It is a fact, however, the she ex
pects soon to become the owner of the
Fair block, which was considered a few
years ago one of the most valuable resi
dence properties in the city, adjoining as
it does the Flood property and being
within a short distance of the Stanford
and Huntington properties. In fact the
deal is practically closed; that much was
admitted by Manager Lee of the Fair
Estate Company yesterday, but Mr. Lee
declined to. divulge the price that is to.be
paid or give any other Information until
the deeds are passed.
"Negotiations for the sale of the prop
erty to Mrs. Blythe-Moore are under
way," said Mr. Lee, "but a sale is not a
sale until it Is made and I can give out
no Information on the subject. I would
prefer that nothing be said about it un
til the i deal Is consummated."
It is understood that the purchase price
will be in the neighborhood of $300,000, but
as there have been no large sales in that
locality for several years- there is little
data from which to make an estimate of
the value of the property. C. P. Hunt
ington paid $250,000 for the Colton house,
including a half a block of land, a few
years ago and land in that vicinity has
certainly not advanced In value since
that time.
There is but one building on the Fair
block, the old Porter residence, on the
corner of Powell and California, now oc
cupied as a boarding-house. It is stated
that tlfe present tenants have been noti
fied to vacate, which would seem, If true,
to Indicate' that extensive improvements
are contemplated In the ; near future.
Another^ rumor of a more shadowy
character, ! however, that has been cir
culating in real estate circles during the
past few days,, is to the effect that James
L. Flood has under consideration an offer
from a syndicate, of .local capitalists for
the Baldwin Hotel site on Market street.
Mr. Flood paid Mr. Baldwin something
over 11,200,000 for the property and rumor
says he has been offered an advance of
something like $100,000 or $150,000. Mr.
Flood is saying nothing and I. W. Hell
man, who was mentioned as one of the
members of the syndicate, says he knows
nothing about It.
NOTED CHIHESE
REFORMER WILL
VENTURE HERE
Circular Issued Tells of
Leong Xi Chew's Bold
Plans. .
Chinese Merchant Claims That a
Most Baring Attempt Was
Made to Kill Him in â¢
His Store.
A circular distributed throughout China
town two nights ago announced that
Leong Xl Chew, one of the famous Chi
nese reformers, now at Honolulu', will be
in this city next month. The document
was written by Chew and issued at the
instigation of the Chinese Empire Reform
Association, whose headquarters are on
Washington street.
In substance the handbill declares -that
if the dethroned Emperor is not rein
stated the powers of Europe will soon in
vade China and eventually control It.
Chew implores the Chinese of America to
use their efforts and money in behalf of
the young Emperor.
The reformer also states that while he
is cognizant of the fact that the Chinese
Government has placed a . large price on
his head, he is willing to. brave all danger
and come to stir up an agitation id Amer
ica. ; He says that he has but one life to
live and is ready to sacrifice it In the
cause of his Emperor. Should Chew come
to San Francisco he may experience some
difficulty In landing, as the Customs
house officials have received positive In
struction to refuse him the privilege of
setting foot on American soil. Chinese
Consul General Ho Vow, in discussing the
circular, said it was a bold piece of work
and believes that the reformer Is brazen
in publlcally announcing his Intention of
visiting this coast.
Ho Chee Ying, a liquor merchant at the
corner of Clay street and Spofford alley,
claims that a daring attempt was made
to take his life yesterday morning. Ylng,
who is a Suey Sing, says that a Hop Sing
man entered his establishment, and after
purchasing 10 cents' worth of whisky,
drew a long revolver, and, pointing it at
the merchant, pulled the trigger three
times. The cartridges failed to explode,
however, and the would-be murderer fled.
me highbinder difficulty is still far
from a settlement. The police look for
crime at any time and tbe work of search
ing Chinese for weapons still goes on.
Chinese Consul General Ho Vow Is work

UNITARIANS TALKED
ABOUT THE CHURCH
Several Speakers Estimated the Po-
sition That It Occupies in Rela
tion to modern Conditions
and Society.
The Unitarian Club last evening at the
Merchants' Club discussed "The Place of
the Church in Modern Life." Sheldon Kel
logg presided. The speakers "were Rev.
Bradford Leavitt, pastor of the First Uni
tarian Church of this city; S. M. Augus
tine,- who spoke, from the position of a
business man; Professor Kendrick C. Bab
cock of the University of California, who
has been engaged in the work of the jouth
Park settlement for two years, and Rbv.
Mr. Hosnier of Berkeley. Rev. Dr. F. "W.
Clampett, pastor of Trinity Episcopal
Church, was to have spoken, but he sent
a letter of regret, in which he wrote that
he was suffering from tonsilltis.
Rev.' Mr. Leavitt Â¦ said that one of the
problems of the time was whether the
church had lost its influence in any de
gree in the world. He thought tbat It
was true that the church was less influ
ential in certain parts of the world than
it had once been, but the. need for religion
was never more strongly felt, nor was re
ligion ever stronger than It was at this
time. People doubted much that the
church held to be dogmatically true; but
Christianity was not losing Its grip, nor
was the world approaching a refined kind
of paganism.- â¢ Immortality could noi be
proved. There was truth underlying ag
nosticism. But man was not all intellect.
He had an ethical-and religious nature
that must be taken into account. There
never had been as much need of a true,
real church as now.
S. M. Augustine said that God did not
need the love of man, but man did need
the love of man. The church should teach
optimism and fit men to live rather than
to die. In closing he eulogized "the sweet
religion of humanity." â¢ â¢
. Professor Babcocfc said that there were
thousands of men in the city who never
gave any thought to God or to religion.
Nevertheless true religion would awaken
a response among them. What thoy
wanted was that church people should
show love in their lives ana dealings with
men as well as in their talk.
Rev. Mr. Hosmer said that all the criti
cisms of the church were true, but the
church would exist as long as society ex
isted.

HEART STILLED,
YET HE LIVES A
WHOLE HOUR
The Strange' Case of Frank
V. Savage at the Re
ceiving Hospital.
Continues to Breathe Long After the
Vital Organ Ceases to' Perform v
Its Functionâ Death Due
< - 'to Excitement.
y . â¢ ' S)
Prank V. Savage, a one-armed man, died
at the City Receiving Hospital last night
from j shock' superinduced by excitement.
A peculiar, feature of the case is that the
man's heart ceased to beat nearly an hour
before death ' ensued. ; " Â«â¢'
Savage had been drinking heavily for a
long- time and under the influence of li
quor displayed a disagreeable and quarrel
some disposition. Early last night he en
tered a Market-street saloon and acted in
a boisterous manner. He threatened any
one who attempted to stop him and his
actions became so -unbearable that the
barkeeper was compelled, to call for' the
police. Â¦ Officer J. N. Beach responded and
after a hard tussle managed to subdue the
drunken man and get him into the patrol
Â¦wagon. .â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦ â¢ Â¦: ' Â¦ â¢ Â¦ -Â¦ .
Savage was a cripple, his left hand hav
ing been amputated and an iron hook
strapped to his arm. On his way to the
prison he gave the officer a great deal of
trouble and it was with great difficulty
that he was held in the wagon.
On reaching the City Prison Savage
stepped from the wagon and walked to
the sergeant's desk. In response to a
question from Sergeant Bidwcll, he gave
his name and immediately after threw up
his arms and fell, to thÂ£ Moor.
It could be seen at once thn.t the man
had fainted and he was hurriedly taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where Dr.
Starr applied the usual restoratives. The
man was breathing faintly, but the doc
tor was absolutely unable to find the least
heart beat nor any perceptible pulse in
the wrist. Respiration continued, but re
gardless of the application of all sorts of
te.sts, even hypodermic injections of
ammonia and coffee and artificial respir
ation, not one beat of the heart could be
located.
Savage's condition remained unchanged
for an hour, when respiration finally
ceased. The case is a strange one, very
few of a similar character having been
noticed by the medical fraternity.
Savage was arrested a few months ago
for assault to murder. In a moment of
passion he shot his wife In the arm at
their home. 42s Twenty-fourth avenue.

Alhambra.
"The Three Musketeers," a drama in
eight tableaus, from the French by Dumas
pere, a play that has made prominent, if
not the fortune of. at least one young
American actress, is on this week at the
Alhambra. Harry Glazier is presented in
the play by E. D. Stair and George H.
Nlcolal. The prominence several stars In
the histrionic world have attained through
this play is sufficient in itself to draw
good houses, but, taken together with its
merit- and the manner in which it is bo
ing presented, additional interest is cen
tered In the success of its run on this visit
to the city. Harry Glazier takes the char
acter of Philip d'Artagnan in the produc
tion and carries the various climaxes to a
satisfactory end. Warren F. Hill. John
P. Barrett and Blanche Stoddard also
take prominent parts in the play, and
their acting Justifies their selection to fill
the important roles assigned them.
OTpheum.
There are five new specialties at the
Orpheum this week and they are all good.
The house was crowded to its utmost ca
pacity last night and the applause was
liberal and hearty. W. C. Fields, an ec-

centric juggler, at once established .him
self as a prime favorite. His tricks are
exceedingly clever and amusing, and the
way in which he manipulated the three
rubber balls was a ma^yel. Walter Jones
and Norma Whalley, comedian and com
edienne, in their specialties at once caught
the fancy of the audience, and Jones' im
itation of Sousa' literally "brought down
the house." His make-up was perfect,
and the mannerisms of the famous band
master and composer were given to the life.
The Misses McCoy and Sam Marion, re
fined acrobatic dancers, gave a very neat
and graceful performance,, and the Niel
sen sisters sang well. Charles H. Weston
and Harry E. Yost gave something new
and fetching in songs and dialogue. Of
the holdovers Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Drew
in their clever sketch, "When Two Hearts
Are Won." were warmly applauded, and
fo was the SI Hassan Ben All troupe,
Flatow and Dunn and their cute . pick
aninny and Howard "Thurston, the card
manipulator. The show Is one of the best
seen at this popular pleasure resort.
Grand Opera-House.
One of the old comic opera favorites,
Offenbach's "The Grand Duchess," was
presented at the Grand Opera-house last
evening after an absence of about four
years. The scenery and settings are
bright and fresh and the costume? are In

piece. The leading parts were taken by
Edith Mason, the Grand Duchess; Hattfe
Belle Ladd as Wanda, Thomas H. Persse
as Fritz and William Wolff .as General
Bourn. All were in good voice and pleased
the audience. There were several, recalls
for the "Sabre" song, rendered by Miss
Mason. Next week "El Capitan" will bt

This is the last,. week i of | "The Idol's

"Because She Loved Him So" opened. its
second week last night at* the Columbia
Theater to a good house. Annie: lrish. J.
E. Dodson and Kate Meek were called be

second act.
Beginning next Monday evening Wiilie
Collier and his special company will ap
pear in his new farce entitled ."Air.

York, Chicago and Philadelphia and has
been flatteringly criticized by the press.
California.
, "Pudd'nhead Wilson" drew another
good house at the California last night.
The experience of another night on a new
stage seemed to have lent greater con
fidence to the company and the play was
interrupted by frequent bursts of applause
Burr Mclntosh. as Pudd'nhead. justified
the encomiums bestowed on him and his
support rose nobly to the occasion.
"Pudd'nhead Wilson" should draw well
throughout the week.
Olympia.
The chief Interest in the Olympla.show
this week seems to center on a woman
with a phenomenal voice, whose name is
withheld from public knowledge. Snc it
advertised as "the lady with the velvet
mask." As such she appeared last' night,
but judging from her voice there was but
little excuse for the disguise. The "rryss
terlous one," whoever she is. made
quite a hit last night, and the rest of the
bill is good.

THERE is Just one word In the En
glish language that will fitly de
scribe the performance of "Diplo
macy" at the Alcazar and that word
Is "Wow!"
If, after the first rehearsal, the com
pany had gone In a body to the managers
office and said feelingly and sincerely
"We can't do it," we would have been
spared the Infliction of a thoroughly bad
performance and would have been suffered
to retain a moderately exalted opinion of
the Alcazar company, which has been
covering itself with credit for these many
Â¦weeks.
"Diplomacy" as a play is almost invul
nerable in point of interest, and there are
many old-schoolers that â¢ are fond of the
play for its own sake or lor the sake of
the actors and actresses gone before, who
have made it memorable. Sardou's cun
ning hand is never more cunning than
when delving in intrigue and "â¢Diplo
macy" is replete with his peculiar con
structive cleverness. But it is by the very
adroitness of the author's manipulation of
plot and character that the Alcazar peo
ple fall, and fall hard.
The play Is rich with opportunities, but
effectiveness in this production is conspic
uous by its absence, and the company acts
Â¦with unrelieved amateurishness. I should
except Howard Scott in the part of Baron
Stein, for he displays not a little of that
faculty for character work of which he
has at other times given proof.
Mary Hampton's classification as an
emotional actress Is what in all probabil
ity prompted the powers on O'Farrell
etreet to produce "Diplomacy." but no one
â¢would think the Countess Zicka, as she
Â«icts it. to be a part of particular possi
bilities. Jeffrey Williams, who does Henry
Eeauclerc. is conscious, I am sure, of how
sadly he is miscast, and I would be will
ing to make the same allowance for
Ernest Hastings if he were amenable to
the conviction that in certain lines of seri
ous acting there are some things that he
cannot do.
George Webster has one of those parts
In which his ponderous mouthlngs are
Eiven full play; he is bo maliciously bad
in some things that I cannot believe he is
aware of his own cleverness when he
occasionally gets away from himself and
does a bit of good acting.
The best these three men can do ac
cording to their lights and restrictions is
to act earnestly and fall utterly. "Di
plomacy" is not intended to arouse the 'Â¦
risibilities, but the audience last night
was a-churkle at the- frequent episodes of
mock acting and ineptitute that 'marked
the performance. Miss May Blayney was
as ever pleasant In voice and demeanor,
but in her efforts to act she more than
half succeeded. In doing this much she

use in this school Is so complete In all Its
details that the students become as effi-
cient as Prof. Weltmer himself in this
great art to cure In .ten days. This noble
profession is taught either by mall or per-
sonal instructions. Any one who desires
can learn it, and any one who learns can
practice it. This has been abundantly
proved by the great number who have
been Instructed and who nre in the active
practl.ee of healing by this method. This
is beyond doubt-the best paying profession
of the age, as students who have learned
this method throuth the American School
of Magnetic Healing are earning from 110
to $50 pei day.
By addressing Prof. J. H. Kelly. Secre-
tary. Nevada. Mo., you will receive full in-
structions free of charge.
Prof. S. A. Weltmer, the eminent scien-
tist of Nevada. Mo., who originated that
Method of Magnetic Healing known ; as
Weltmerism, and which is indorsed by
both the press and the pulpit, has demon-
strated that disease is a crime. In a re-
cent interview he stated: "A crime is a
breach. Whether a breach of moral prin-
ciples, of law or of nature, it is still a
crime. Now, disease -is a breach of na-
ture, brought on by either an abuse of
nature or by not following nature's edict,
and whether this breach be in commission
or in omission, nature, like the State, de-
mands a penalty. Now I wish to demon-
strate that at the present time the, exist-
ing of disease is a double-headed crime â
first by its appearance, second by its con-
tinuationâfor there is no disease, no mat-
ter how hopeless it may seem or of
how long Etanding, that cannot be
cured. Therefore, to continue in disease
1b a crime not only to oneself but to pos-
terity yet to come. Now w*e have demon-
strated by scientific researches that dis-
ease is a product produced by human
hands and is unnatural, therefore it can
again be remedied by human hands. The
reason that the . method which I have
originated has had such phenomenal suc-
cess Is because it acts In a perfectly nat-
ural manner, without the aid of either
drugs or the surgeon's knife, by "going
to the very seat of the trouble and placing
the constitution, in a robust condition. It
cures ail disease, no matter whether
chronic or acute. Take, for instance,
woman, who In the majority of cases is
placed upon the rack of torture simply
because those organs which make her a
woman are in' an unnatural condition.

HEALTH BOARD'S
CREMATORY WILL
EMPTY A HOTEL
Burning Ch inatown Garbage
Under the Windows Is
Astonishing Fact Is Developed That
Nuisance Exists Only Because
of Persistent Ignoring, of
â¢the Law. '&Â£'.
The Board "of Health may have a dam
age suit on its hands as a result of the
huge nuisance it is maintaining in -. a va
cant lot on Pacific street, between Stock
ton and Dupont. Night. and day. for some
time, a fire has been kept burning on the
lot to destroy - 4 the -.refuse of Chinatown.
Yesterday there was a stir on Broadway.
The open-air crematory is directly behind
and ' adjoining a large lodging-house
known as the Colofnbo Hotel, of which
F.'. Zeiro is the proprietor. Yesterday Mr.
Zeiro,' wearied at .having 1 ., his 'lodgers
smoked tout, and realizing that his . busi
ness will inevitably be ruined .unless the
nuisance is abated, sent for the owner of
the property and notified him of his in
tention to vacate the - premises. , : *
For many days it has been impossible to
keep open any, windows in the neighbor
hood either on Broadway, Pacific or on
any adjacent street,* for the fumes have
penetrated everywhere. The fact that the
refuse all came from Chinatown has not
tended to soothe the feelings of: the ag
grieved residents of .that populous section.
The, owner of the Colombo -Hotel prop
erty remonstrated with the landlord, but
Zeiro was firm In his determination to get
out. 'Later in < the- afternoon the aston
ishing' fact -'-was- developed" that the; only
reason existing for converting the vacant
lot into an open crematory- for Chinese
garbage is the negligence of the Board "bf
Health in not enforcing the ordinance
making it " obligatory for scavengers â¢to
keep their carts tightly : covered. Atten
tion was called ' to Â¦ the fact by The Call
last week that the law was being ignored,
and yesterday afternoon Dr. Chalmers,
chief sanitary i inspector, 0 who is i supervis
ing the burning of the garbage, : admitted
that the work was â¢ done : on the open lot
simply because the Board of Health did
not wish, to; move: the; stuff through the
business Â¦ streets in '; open carts I because of
danger from bacteria."- He. seemed Ignor
ant of the existence of the ordinance re
quiring; the carts to : be > covered. Â¦Â¦: The or
dinance; referred â¢ to : providing ' for covers
for the scavenger carts is about two years
old : and has been studiously ignored. â¢

that condition which nature and God
meant them to be, thereby dispelling the
pain and agony which so often comes
with the monthly period; it also dispels all
danger during that critical period known
as change of life. In fact, it is the only
positive cure for all female troubles.
"Then.again.take man in that weakened
condition which is called Lost Manhood,
and In my experience I have had thou-
sands of men place themselves under my
treatment who have. been almost drugged
to death by nostrums they saw advertised,
and I am proud to say that I have been
able to perfect a cure in every instance*"
We cannot but believe with Prof. Welt-
mer that to allow disease' to continue is a
crime. Our reason for coming to this be-
.lief is that it has now been demonstrated
that there is a cure for all diseases. For
Weltmerism has been given more severe
tests than has any curative power known
to man, and the fact that it ha 3 cured
more than 100.000 men and women from
every disease known is positive proof that
Weltmerism will cure when all else fails.
The most remarkable feature about Welt-
merism is that part known as the Absent
Treatment, which annihilates space and
cures disease, no matter at what distance
the patient may live. We take great
pleasure in publishing here a few of the
many thousand testimonials that are in
the hands of Prof. J. H. Kelly, the emi-
nent co-laborer of Prof. Weltmer:
T. T. Rodes of Paris. Mo., the Prosecut-
ing Attorney of Monroe County, suffered
for years with Sciatic Rheumatism. Tried
everything without benefit. Was in-
stantly cured through Prof. - Weltmer's
Absent Treatment.
Mrs. C. P. Graham of Boise City, lowa,
was afflicted for nine years with rheuma-
tism: she could not walk without crutches
or lift her hands to her head; she paid out
$300) with doctors before coming to Jye-

STATE OWNERSHIP.
/^ALIFORNIA entered upon a small experiment
\ in State ownership of lands, somewhat on the
single tax line. ' It is in the form of an amend
ment to our State revenue law, which makes the State
the sole purchaser of lands sold for delinquent taxes.
Before this law^was passed such; lands were sold to
tax title -buyers.. The theory of the change was, of
course, that the oppressed delinquent taxpayer could
redeem his property from the State before expiration
of his equity, without paying a speculative advance
which the tax title buyer might exact from him. The
Teaf motive behind this theory appears to have been
to introduce the State into the real estate business as
a land-owner. Of course if the State could succeed
in amassiifg a considerable landed estate it would be
practically withdrawing that much property from
taxation, since it cannot pay taxes to itself. This
would increase the burden of taxation upon, the pri
vate owners, and this would naturally be followed by
an increase in delinquencies and further additions to
the State's holdings. Of course to- utilize its lands
and realties the State will have to become a renter
and take the rental value of its property .as public
revenue. The real projectors of the law, the single
taxers, would then have their system in actualopera
tion.
It never occurred to any one that the delinquent
taxpayer could be protected against abuse by legally
limiting the advance that the tax title buyer could
put on the property for. redemption. The law could
protect the treasury, the delinquent and the buyer
equally, so that the treasury would get the taxes, the
buyer a reasonable return on his money, and the de
linquent a chance to redeem without being oppressed.
The change has furnished no better protection to
the treasury and has introduced oppression, not of
the delinquent, but of the payer of taxes.
As is usual when the State goes into paternalism,
there is less scrupulous exactness in the transaction
of business by revenue officials. The result is that a
great many taxpayers all over the State who hold re
ceipts for their taxes find that without their knowl
edge the State has become the owner of their prop
erty through purchase under this paternal law. The
entry of their payment has not been carried forward
to the final account and they have been sold out as
delinquents. Their troubles do not stop there. Un
der the old system when such a mistake occurred the
presentation of a tax receipt canceled the claim of
the tax title buyer. If hehad any way of getting back
his money from the treasury that was his business.
The property-owner got the advantage due to his vigi
lance and civic spirit in the pronjpt payment of his
tax. Now this is all changed. The citizens who hold
tax receipts, and find that through neglect their prop
erty has gone to the final account and
been sold to the State, are compelled to pay their tax
over again to get back their own! On no other terms
will the State let*go its grip. . It is confiscation and
nothing else. We believe the oppressed taxpayer has
recourse in the Federal courts, where a State may be
sued. It is depriving a citizen of his property with
out due process of law. But suing the State is ex
pensive. The State pays its lawyers out of the treas
ury, with the raonqy furnished by the taxpayers, so
that the suitor, when he goes. to law with the State,
is, in a certain sense, suing himself and has to pay
both sides of the fight.
Therefore it is cheaper for the average sufferer to
pay his tax twice and get his property back than it
is for him to fight for his rights in the Federal courts.
The law was unsound in principle, and therefore
proves a failure and an oppression in administration,
and should be repealed.
NERVING GREAT BRITAIN.
IN prospect of victory Lord Roberts is doing his
part in the politics of the war by reporting "Boer
â¢outrages" and other things defamatory of ..the
brave but few in South Africa who have held an em
pire at bay for half a year.
The course of his Lordship is deliberately taken to
justify the crime of politics that is to follow the trag
edy of war. The sinister purpose of Cecil Rhodes is
to be .accomplished, and duality of government in
South Africa is to cease by the destruction of the re
publics.
There seems no ground for holding the least hope
of any other result. ' Of course we leave out of the
calculation things not in sight now. The Transvaal
may stubbornly resist so long that complications else
where will change the whole aspect of affairs. That
England feels how little might turn the scale is shown
by the official prder to make the display of the Irish
flag and adulation of the shamrock an effusive offi
cial ceremony, under the patronage of her Majesty.
While the Irish have never been formidable, this in
cident is evidence that the right little, tight -little isl
and will feel safer if the Irish are flattered into re
pqse. But, including all the visible and probable fac
tors, there is in sight no help for the assassination of
the two republics. That which Rhodes attempted in
the Jameson raid Chamberlain will accomplish by a
war that was begun upon another pretext, but for the
same purpose. . Â¦
Not even the British Liberals will present a united
front against the destruction of the republics. In "his
speech in the Commons on February 15, after re
peating the history of the American Civil War, which
began with a call for 75.000 soldiers and required a levy
of 2,750,000 men before it was over, Lord Rosebery
replied to a member of the Ministry who said, "This
is not a great crisis like that; that was a matter of
life and death," as follows: "I say this is a matter
of life and death. I completely adopt the words of the
noble Lord opposite. Take the hypothesis for one
moment, though we will not admit it, that you should
not be victorious in this war. Then you lose South
Africa. You could not show your face there. You
lose the principal colony of your empire. You lose
the mtfst important base you have outside these isl
ands. But if you lose South Africa you lose a great
deal more than that. This empire rests largely upon
prestige. These colonies, that have come so en
thusiastically to our "support, have done so because
they believe' they are associating themselves with the
most powerful empire the world has ever seen. If
you deprive them of that feeling the life of your em
pire is short. You will be shut up in these islands,
one of which, I fear, does not love you, and your
empire outside will break away from you, and where
it is without defense will fall a prey to other nations.
In the meantime you alone, with your fleet, will be
in the midst of a Europe which has many, scores to
pay off and will be only too ready to begin."
It is impossible to see in this declaration by an
opponent of the war any other lesson than the ne
cessity of destroying the republics whose existence
has caused a menace to the life of the empire. The
British feeling is practically universal that the pres
tige of the nation requires the wiping out of the
Boer governments. And as Lord Rosebery admits
that prestige is the foundation of the empire, what
ever maintains it is necessary to imperial life.
A world power then becomes greatly like a world's
champion pugilist â must respond to every challenge
to fight, and win in every battle, or give up the belt.
English Liberals are as much committed as the Con
servatives to the maintenance of the empire, and so
there is no room to hope for any effective opposition
to Mr. Chamberlain's programme for making- a
crown colony out of the two Dutch states.
Still Lord Roberts finds it necessary to fire the
British heart, and even Parliament encourages mobs
to break up anti-war meetings, and free speech is
checked throughout the islands, not by law, but by
lawlessness.
Standing over against Lord Roberts' report de
faming the Boers maybe put this sorrowful bit from
a letter by a Royal Army Medical Corps officer,
written from near Ladysmith: "One of the Boer
medical officers rode in to us under a Red Cross flag
and asked us to go and bury our dead, which we did.'
But the sight of those poor fellows lying on the hill,
some of them dreadfully riddled with bullets, I can
never forget. The Boers were very good; in fact,
one would hardly have thought they were enemies.
They talked to us quite freely and helped us to dig
the graves and to carry our dead. There was one
very touching incident. After our major had read
the burial service one of the Boers stepped out and
said a short prayer, hoping the war would soon end,
and while we stood with uncovered heads they sang
a hymn in Dutch. It cut our fellows up very much
indeed; in fact, we could hardly speak for some
time."
Incidents of that sort are not widely circulated in
Great Britain, where a political emergency, incident
to the prestige of empire," makes it necessary to pre
sent the Boer as an unfeeling savage.

Croker's Best Story.
I have heard a good many stories In my
time, said Richard Croker.the Tammany
"boss." .the trouble : is . to remember
them. I enjoy them " when I hear Them,
but they go in one ear and out the other.
The best one I can- now recall is about
Sheriff Dunn. : Perhaps you . know that
there is a Thomas â¢ Dunn Â¦ Association,
named after the Sheriff. It Is a social or
ganization and gives a ball every. year.
Last year the Imll was givqn Boon after
Mr. Dunn* was elected and there- was a
big attendance. One man, an old friend
of the Sheriff, got himself up 'â¢ in great
shape for the occasion, appearing for the
first time' in his life In evening dress. '
He went -up to Dunn at the ball.
"Hello. Tom," he said;; "how do I look
in a dress suit?'.' . Â¦ " ' Â¦ . ~ \
"First rate." said the Sheriff, "why
don't you get . one?" ; - : -.--
On another occasion ' a certain Tam
many man came to' Dunn's office' and
told him he was Â¦ going i to ' be . married.
"That's good news," . said { the Sheriff,

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AT WORK.
I ATE reports of experiments with wireless
â¢ telegraphy made by officers of the German
â * navy are to the' effect that such improvements
have been made in the system that it is now avail
able for use at distances of upward of fifty miles over
water, when the messages are sent to a fixed station,
but that for some reason communications are not ac
curately received by a ship at a distance of more than
thirty-five miles.
The experiments were conducted by officers on the
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, .communicating with a
land station. When the steamer was fifty miles away
her signals were distinctly and correctly read at the
station, but the. return signals were not clear at that
distance. These results, while 'not equal to the ex
pectations of the more sanguine portion of the world,
show a wonderful accomplishment, considering the
recent beginning of the system.
Less than a year ago. when The Call received re
ports from the international yacht race off New York
harbor by wireless telegraphy,* the announcement that
such messages, amounting to many thousands 'Â¦â¢Â¦ of
words, had been received across fifteen miles of water
was met in some quarters with incredulity and scoff
ing. The yellow journals' in particular were sure the
reports were the result of faking. The Examiner in
this city, for example, actually declared there was no
such thing possible as wireless telegraphing. Now
the feat accomplished by the Germans shows the sys
tem to be practicable for fifty miles under good con
ditions, and "available between ships for a distance
more than double that covered by the telegrams sent
last summer. .-â¢ '{y,

TWENTY LESSONS IN FRENCH
PARIS has made herself more radiant than ever,
and during the summer will entertain visitors
from aU parts of the globe by an exposition of
the wonders of human industry and the marvels which
the arts and the sciences of- the nineteenth cenlury
have accomplished.. To visit the city thousands of
people in the United States are now preparing, and
therefore the series of lessons in French conversation
which are now appearing in The Call are to many
the most interesting and most instructive of the entire
spring course of the Home Circle Studies.
These lessons, twenty in number, have been pre
pared especially for Americans who have no-knowl
edge of the language by Professor Benno Kirsch
baum, a distinguished French scholar and teacher.
All ; readers'.' of -The Call who wish to make a begin
ning in French conversation will findit to their ad
vantage to follow these studies. The ability to use
ten French words "to the point" will help to make
"touring" easier, and a working vocabulary of one
hundred words will surely cover up a ' multitude of
embarrassments. Professor- Kirschbaum \ has -con
ducted European parties, and is thoroughly familiar
with the initial language needs of an American .in
Paris. . ... â¢--' . % -
Several papers of the series have . been published
and have received warm commendation from persons
who are not. only familiar with. the French language
but have had considerable experience in teaching it
to Americans, and, therefore are well fitted to judge
of the merit of the lessons as home studies. ""â¢ â¢
Even to' persons who are not going to Paris the
course will be found an agreeable as well as a useful
study, for in a cosmopolitan city like San Francisco it
is always of advantage to know something at least
of that which has been called "the polite language of
the world/ These French lessons therefore deserve
the attention 1 of all, and. will well repay the time^and
study gjjven them. " .

The McCarthy resolution
SUPERVISOR MCCARTHY has taken the first
?tep toward remedying the defect in the char
ter which leaves the telephone company free
from the municipal supervision provided for- every
ether person, company or corporation having a fran
chise for operating a public utility. . Thus the trick
which the telephone company, through its astute at
torney, perpetrated upon the charter-makers is in a
fair way to be defeated as promptly as the machinery
of the law permits.
The resolution declares:
That the Board of Supervisors of the city and county
of S?an Francisco hereby propose .to the qualified elec
tors of the city and county of San Francisco that sub
division 14, section 1, chapter 2, article 11, of the charter
of the city a.nd county of San Francisco be amended to
read as follows:
Subdivision 14. To fix and determine by ordinance In
the month of February of each year, to take effect on
the Ist day of July thereafter, the maximum rates of
compensation to be collected by any person, company
or corporation in the city and county for the use of
water, heat, light, power, telephone, telegraph or pneu
matic service, supplied % to the city and county or to the
inhabitants thereof, and to prescribe the quality of the
6*rvice.
Further resolved. That the attention of the Election
Commissioners be and is hereby called to this resolution.
The resolution having been referred to the Judi
ciary Committee, is now to be considered upon its
merits. It is to be borne in mind there is nothing
in it which savors of any injustice to telephone com
panies or corporations. The amendment merely puts
them on the same plane with light, heat, power and
pneumatic service companies and other organizations
of the kind. It does no more than remedy a serious
defect in the charter. That is all.
That some form of supervision over telephone cor
porations is necessary to protect the rights of the pub
lic is beyond a doubt. The demand for the supervision
is not confined to San Francisco. In Massachusetts
it is propose^to place all such companies or corpora
tions under the control of a State commission, be
cause the aggressions of the telephone corporations
in that State have been found intolerable. Congress
has found it necessary to interfere to protect- the
rights of the people of the District of Columbia
against such corporations. Supervision here will
therefore be in line with the policy adopted else
where.
There is no reason to be given why the charter
should not be amended in the way proposed, and
therefore it can hardly be doubted the Supervisors
will promptly adopt the McCarthy resolution. That
being so, the Election Commission c^n submit the
i^sue to the electors in time to have it ready for rati
fication by the Legislature next winter. That pro
gramme is one on which there should be unanimity
among all faithful officials and intelligent citizens.

CLUBMAN WHITTELL'S
HOME IS IN DOUBT
Judge Morrow to Decide Whether He
Lives in New York or San
Francisco.
Nearly the whole time of tha session of
the United States Circuit Court was taken
up yesterday with the hearing of the ar
gument in the matter of the application
of Mrs. Ellen A. Fife ( to return to the
Superior Court the suit of herself against
George .Whlttell for $790,000 damages for
alleged . mismanagement of her share o,f
Â¦ the Nicholas Lunirig estate, the reason
alleged for the application being that
Whitteirhas not abandoned his residence
in this State.
William S. Wood of LJoyd & Wood made
the principal argument for Mr. Whittell's
contention that the- Federal Court had
jurisdiction and sought' to show that Mr.
Whittell had changed his residence to New
York City and because that metropolis
offered more opportunities than did San
Francisco for the investment of capital
and the enjoyment of the social amenities
of life.
Ex-Superior Judge Slack, for Mrs. Fife,
quoted numerous decisions of the courts
to show that a man could be a citizen of
one State and a resident of 'another. Ho
argued that Mr. Whittell's admission that
he would continue to reside in San Fran
cisco until the case was disposed of was a
virtual acknowledgment of his residence
here within the meaning of the law, so
far as it affected the jurisdiction of the
courts.
Judge Morrow took the matter under
advisement.

11. WIRELESS TELEGBAPHY.
. (Continued.)
The "Work of Hertz.
The idea of the electro-magnetic char
acter of light was advanced by Clerk
Maxwell about 1564. and the theory was
fully developed In his book published in
1573. The identity in character of all other
: waNes was generally accepted as a fact
before it was demonstrated experiment
ally, and many investigators had worked
in thi3 direction In vain before the solu
tion of the problem was hit upon by
Hertz. ->kii . â¢ \_
It is easy to. start waves In the ether.
In fact almost any natural phenomenon
starts them. The difficulty was In detect
ing their presence when they lay outelde
the range of light and heat effects.
Bapid Discharges Oscillatory.
When an electrically charged body is
discharged the character of the- discharge
depends upon the properties of the dis
charging circuit. If that circuit has mag
netic properties In any marked degree it
acts as a- damper and the charge runs-off
with comparative slowness as a current
In one direction only. If. however, the
magnetic properties are absent or of very
small" value the electric charge surges
rapidly out, past the point of equilibrium,
then back again and oscillates in this way
until the energy I has been dissipated as
heat. A spark discharge, of which light
ning Is. an example on the greatest scale
known to" us, oscillates while it lasts at
the rate of perhaps many million times a
second and starts waves in ether of a cor
responding frequency and length. The
rate of oscillation depends upon the prop- ;
erties of the discharging circuit and by a
proper adjustment of that circuit the
length of the wave may be regulated. _
The oscillatory character of such a dis
charge was known many years before
Hertz but as no method was known of
detecting such ether waves In space the
experimental investigation of their prop
erties was impossible. Hertz discovered a
method of detecting these wave 3, and
armed with this detection he pushed
through a rapid and thorough series of
experiments which placed this branch of
science at once on a sound basis of fact.
Spark-Gap Detector.
It was while experimenting with a pair
of similar coils of wire Intended to show
Induction effects, that Hertz noticed .that
if a small Leyden Jar or small induction
coil ; was discharged through one of the
coils current could be induced In the other
provided the circuits - were not complete.
There must be a short < spark-gap. This
spark gap in the first coil furnished the
means for exciting the very, sudden dis
turbance of the ether, and th y e second coil,
similarly arranged, became. a detector of
ether waves, responding most strongly to
ether vibrations of its own natural period.
. In all : his experiments Hertz made use
of sympathetic or resonating action. The
exciter was the spark passing between
t wo â¢ polished balls .on either , side of the
break In discharging the circuit, which
was fed by the action of an ; ordinary
Ruhmkorff coil. The detector, or "elec
trical eye," as Lord Kelvin has called it,
was usually a simple rectangle or circle
of zinc- In this wire , there was a break,
with a knob or ball on each side, and the
distance between the knobs could be reg
ulated by a micrometer screw.' Although
this detector t would respond within a con
siderable range, ; the Â¦ sparks reached a
maximum i for a particular, adjustment at
which the natural periods ; of < the exciter
and' the detector .were the same. An Im
provement "made by later :. investigators
consists : In . keeping the spark terminals
Immersed in oil. This prevents the rough
enlng of the surface and seems to makÂ»
the discharge more regular, probably by
the same action as that of the electrolytic
interruption.
Properties of Ether "Waves.
By means of these simple devices Hertz
made a complete Investigation of tho
properties of electric waves In the ether.
He found that they were reflected by me
tallic surfaces, but passed through wood
and stone and other insulating sub
stances; and he succeeded in refracting
them by a great prism of pitch Just aa
light is refracted by a prism of glassy Ha
measured the length of waves and their
speed, which was the same as that of
light. In the coursff of a lecture deliv
ered not long after this Lodge said, refer
ring to ether waves of this kind: "They
can be reflected by plane sheets of metal,
concentrated by parabolic reflectors, re
fracted by prisms, concentrated by lenses.
I have at the college a large lens of pitch,
weighing over three hundredweight, -for
concentrating them to a focus. They can
be made to show the phenomena of inter
ference and thus have their wave lengths
accurately measured. They are stopped
by all conductors and transmitted by all
Insulators. Metals are opaque, but even
imperfect Insulators, such as wood or
stone, are strikingly transparent, and
waves may be received in one room from
a. source in another, the door between the
two being shut." '-.-Z'.'Z
Space Telegraphy.
This was the germ of space telegraphy
In its present form. The wave is started
by suitable apparatus, travels through tho
ether with the speed of light and Is re
ceived by other devices much more sensi
tive than that used by Hertz. These will
be described later.
As the ether waves are absorbed by con
ductors, the action In the usual method
of signaling with wires is evidently only
a special case, in which the ether waves*
started at the transmitting end are re
ceived by the.wire of the circuit, the di 3Â»
turbance penetrating the wire from tho
outside, and In this way a much larger
proportion of the energy la U3ed where It
Is wanted than In any system In which
wire circuits are dispensed with. The
two actions may be roughly compared to
the transmission of sound waves from one
point to another by shoutimc In the open
air and by talking through a speaking
tube.
A method of signaling, through Â» pace
which may.be considered to lie between
the ordinary system with a wire circuit
and the modern wireless telegraphy is
that which has been used to signal movlnjr
trains. The car containing the receiving
apparatus was fitted with a wire running
the length of the roof or the side, and tho
message was transmitted from the polÂ»
lipe running alongside the - track to thÂ»
wire on\the car by Induction through thÂ«
space separating the two. , This wa* the
propagation of a true ether wave, differ
ing from* the, latest methods chiefly in the
period. and wave length of the disturb
ance and In the sensitiveness and ar
rangement of the apparatus responding
to it.
The development of the , method Â¦ new
generally designated by the name ''wire
less telegraphy" will be described In thÂ«
next paper. .

Fast Voyage of the Ameri
can Ship From New York
to This Port.
Sugar Fleet Quarantined â The Bark
Alaska to Take Passengers to
Norne â Brig W. Q. Irwin
Sold.
Five vessels came in from the southern
seas, one ship from Central America and
another from New York yesterday. Of the
island fleet four were sent into quarantine
and will be kept there until fumigated.
The only one that escaped was the
schooner Eliza Miller from Apia, Samoa,
with a cargo of copra. She made the run
up in the good time of forty-eight days.
The vessels put in quarantine were the
German ship H. F. Glade, twelve and a
half days; bark R. P. Rithet, eighteen
days, and a schooner, twenty-seven days,
all from Honolulu, and the bark C. D.
Bryant, fifteen days from Lahaina,- H. I.
All the vessels had fine weather through
out, but the Glade got a fine slant of
wind, which she carried with her nearly
all the way to San Francisco.
The British ship Jessomene made the
run from Acapulco in thirty-three days.
She came here in ballast and will load
wheat for Europe. The other arrival was
the American ship Susquehanna. This tine
vessel made the run from New York here
in the fast time of 114 days. The run to
the equator in the Atlantic was made in
30 days. When 56 days out she was off
Cape St. John and the next day passed
the British ship Sierra Podrosa, now out
32$ days from Antwerp. The run from 50
in the Atlantic to 50 in the Pacific was
made in 16 days and when 97 days Out the
Susquehanna crossed the equator in the
Pacific. From the equator to San . Fran
cisco the run was made in 17 days, a
splendid performance. â¢ Soon after cross
ing the equator on this side the Susque
hanna ran into a number of severe
squalls, accompanied by very heavy rain.
A number of sails were blown away and
some other damage done, but nothing se
rious. Â¦ j
Captain M. T. Bailey, who commands
the Susquehanna this trip, is well known
in San Francisco. He was here last year
as mate of the Erskine M. Phelps, with
Captain Graham, .and made a host of
friends. As master of the Susquehanna
he has made a record for that vessel and
shows, that the confidence of the owners
in him was well placed.
The steamer Cdquille River reports
speaking the sealing schooner Alllo.l. Al
ger on March 15 off Cape Blanco. The
master of the schooner reported picking
up a white skylight and a spring mattress
and also having passed a quantity of lum
ber. The Coqullle River subsequently
passed the lumber between Cape Blanco
and Umpqua. This is probably the deck
load and wreckage washed overboard
from the steamer Tillamook. The latter
vessel is now at Hay & Wright's ship
yard undergoing repairs and her captain
reports losing just such stuff as was seen
by the Allie I. Alger. â
The rush to Nome has begun. The bark
Alaska will be the first of the regular
line to get awayâ on April 10. Gold-hunt

DESPONDENTAND
BENT WITH PAIN
HE CHOSE DEATH
Milkman Ruhland Blew Out
His Brains With a
Shotgun.
o
Had Been Sick for a Year With an
Incurable Disease and Finally
Lost Both Hope and
Courage. ,
Â»
Christian Ruhland, a milkman, residing
at 4306 Point Lobos avenue, blew out his
brains with a shotgun yesterday after
noon. -N
He had been sick for a long time, and
Dr. Lorina had been attending him for
enlargement of the. heart for the past
year, during the greater part, of which
period Ruhland had been confined to hia
bed.
A few moments before the fatal shot
was fired Mrs. Ruhland was in his room,
and he said to her: "If a horse or a cow
suffered as much as I do they would kill
it to put it out of its misery." This re
mark so affected Mrs. Ruhland that she
burst into tears. ,
A few minutes later Mrs. Ruhland went
downstairs tc get some firewood, and
while thus engaged she was startled by
the report of a shotgun. Rosie Ruhland,
who was in the kitchen preparing dinner,
ran into her father's bedroom and saw
his dead body on the floor in a great pool
of blocd. At his feet lay the shotgun.
The â¢ whole of the upper portion of hia
head was blown away.
Ruhland had got out of bed, sat on the
window sill, placed the muzzle of the
shotgun in his mouth and pressed the trig
ger of the right-hand barrel with his toe.
Deceased was a native of Germany, 63
years old. He leaves a widow, two daugh
ters and a son, the children all ijrown.
He had been a partner in the ' Richmond
dairy with a man named Zimmerman.
The remains were taken to the Morgue,
and an inquest will be held.
her, but Captain Cogan will not take an
other passenger for love or money. Those
going north on the Alaska are D. R.
Dwyer and a party of eight- from Seattle;
L. Herman, S. Marsen, C. Ross and a
party of eight from Oakland; J. Y.
Thompson, Tom Marsden, M. Cham
pion, R. Champion; 8. H. Johnson and
wife, J. W. Poston and wife, H. Fielder,
M. Mulane, C. A. Anderson, H. Asmus,
D. W. Bass, J. N. Thompson, J. P. S.
Johnson, Gustafe Anderson, A. Sogren.
J. Doud, J. Dahl and two others, and
C. E. Westlake.
A man named John Schuyler, of the
Schuyler Hardware Company at Ocean
side, wrote asking for a berth, but Cap
tain Cogan sent him back word there
was no berth left: Yesterday Captain
Cogan received a letter saying Schuyler
was coming anyhow, and would take
his chances of getting away on the ves
sel. On the whole bark there is only
room left for fifty tons of freight, and
that will fill up in a day or two. There
will therefore be no trouble in getting
the vessel away on time.
If the Alaska does not make a quick
run to Nome it will not be for lack of
experienced Arctic navigators. Along
with Captain Cogan goes Captain Lew
Williams and Captain Green. These men
have spent nearly all their lives in the
frozen north and know every turn
like a book.
The transport Columbia will move from
Folsom to Harrison street, and the War
ren will go alongside the Missouri to-day.
The remains of the dead soldiers were
taken off the Duke of Fife yesterday and
that vessel will dock at Union street to
day, while the Hancock and Grant will
both dock at Folsom street. The Grant
will sail for Manila on May 1.
The barkentine Catherine Sudden, now
fitting out for the Nome trade. -is going
to take north thirty surf boats, each of
one ton capacity. A company formed
here is going into the lighterage busi
ness and is sending the surf boats north
for that purpose. Â¦
Another of the Spreckels fleet of sugar
boats has been sold. Yesterday the brig
William G. Irwin was purchased, by
Scammell & King for the Nome trade.
The Irwln is now on nor way here ana
on her arrival will be turned over to her
new owners. The Spreckels Bros. Co. is
selling all Its small vessels, and will re
place them with large four-masted
schooners. One of these, the Helene, Is
now on her maiden trip in command of
Captain Christensen, late of the brig J.
D. Spreckels. â¢ . â. '" .
The new schooner Churchill, built at
Coos Bay for; A. M. Simpson, is expected
here in a few days. Some years ago Mr.
Simpson announced that with- the com
pletion of a barkentine then on the
stocks he would stop building vessels.
Following out this plan, the barkentine
was named Omecra. Some years later Mr.
Simpson built another vessel, thus break
ing his resolution. This schooner he
christened Addenda, and now comes still
another fine big vessel which he will call
The steamer Newport sailed for Central
American ports yesterday with a very
large cargo and quite a number of pas
sengers in the cabin.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 1900.
TWENTY LESSONS IN FRENCH CONVERSATION.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
. Note. â These lessons have been prepared for
The Call's Home Study Circle by Professor
Benno Klrsehbaum of Philadelphia. They are
intended . primarily for Americans who pur
pose attending the Paris Exposition. The les
sons will Include (1) common French words and
phrases, (2) easy conversation and (3) simple
reading lessons. __â
LESSON NO. 5.
Something About Pronunciation.
Â¦- 1. There are certain vowels which,
though double, as ai, eu, ou, etc.. have the
sound of only one vowel. Theso vowels,
when double, are called "compound vo-w
els." The most important of these are:
al, ae. are pronounced like ai in hair, as
clalr (light), clare; bouteille (bottle), boo
tay.
au, eau, are pronounced like o in note,
as aurpre (morning glow), oh-rore.
eu, oeu, are pronounced like v in but, as
peuple (people), pup-le; soeur (sister),
suhr.
ou is pronounced like oo In wood, as
route (road), root.
A Few Practical Hints.
2. As there are but ' two genders In
French, masculine and feminine, ihings
which are neuter in English are either
masculine or feminine in French. It id
hard to give a positive rule as to which
nouns are masculine and which feminine.
We will try to give as far as possible a
guide to gender in each lesson. In case of
doubt, however, consult your dictionary
and memorize the noun with its proper
article.
3. The following few useful notes will
materially aid the student in confronting
some difficulties he will meet. Therefore
remember that â
(a) the name of God and all supernat
ural beings are masculine.
God; Dieu; dee-yeu.
Angel; l'ange; ang-zj.
Demon; le demon; day-mong.
(b) nouns which designate man m his
different conditions are also masculine.
Brother; le frere; frare. â¢/. >
Soldier: la eoldat; sol-dah.
(c) furthermore, nouns designating the
males of animals, as
Horse; le cheval; chev-val.
Lion; le lion; lee-ong.
(d) the seasons and cardinal points are
masculine.
The spring; le printemps; luh pran
tong.
The summer; l'ete; lay-tay.
The fall; I'automne; 10-tonne.
The winter: Thiver; lee-vair.
The north: le nord; luh nor.
The south; le sud; luh suud.
The east; Test; lest.
The west; l'ouest; l'west.
In the next lesson we shall give a few
similar notes regarding feminine nouns.
Memory Exercises.
1. I am hungry.

Vous^avez tort; voo-zav-ay tor.
6. They are right.
Ils^ont raison; eel-zong ray-zong.
Note.â ln French we say: I have hunger:
have you thirst; we have sleep, etc. As this is
the only way of expressing oneself, without ex
ception, try to remember this peculiarity.

their nouns, as: A white dress; una rob*
blanche: uhn robe btanarsh. A white hat; un
chapeau blanc: ung shappoh. blang.
Noteâ By the above examples the student will
observe that "white" is expressed by "blanche"
and "blanc." This change Is due to the dif
ference in gender, "dress" being femlnlna and
"hat" masculine.
42. A pair of black gloves;
Une paire de gants nolrs;
Uhn pair duh gang nwar.
43. A brown felt hat:

7.Vrct' York Stock Market.
SUW YORK, March 19.â The stock market
Bave evidence to-day of a disposition on the
jart of the ppeculatlve contingent to discount
the p!~jsj>Â«-cis of relief to the money market
for funds to operate with and while there were
pymptoms of relaxation in money rates the
supply is still extremely restricted. Lenders
of money are Inclined to hold ou\ for high
rates 0:1 the as-sumpUon that interest rates
vil! n..t re-lax until after the April 1 settle
ments have ijeen disposed of. The borrowers
take a more hopeful view of the immediate
outli^'k and are inclined to await - ttie ex
pected early easing of rates. There Was an
miprvciaUe stirring of speculative Interest to
da.- which way notably manifest in the rail
road lift, but which was mostly confined to a
few stocks. .Baltimore and Ohio was the most
conspicuous, with a rise of 3 points. Union
Pacific, Baltimore and Ohio preferred. Atchl
Â»on preferred and the Colorado and Southern
stocks were oil in good demand and gained
over a point. Mobile and Ohio and Minne
apolis and St. I>3Uls preferred rose 2 points
each. The bears made attempts to obstruct
the rising tendency of prices. They first made
a raid upon the New York stocks on the ground
that the tax levied under the new franchise
tax law will be so considerable as to threaten
their ability to pay dividends. Later an at
tack 'was made on the Iron and Steel group
tiaÂ»ed on the threatened strike of machinists.
Neither of these was effective in breaking up
the etrength manifest among the railroads.
In fact the railroad list showed more hesita
tion in face of the violent rallies in the local
traction group than in the weakness of the
specialties. It is well understood that the
vicissitudes of the New York stocks are greatly
concerned with a rivalry approaching the char
acter of a feud among come of the most pow
Â«-r:ul financial interests in the street and peace
ru! bystanders have been shown to be as likely
to be injured in this conflict as the actual
partic!j>ants. The chief episode in this conflict
to-day was the severe punishment inflicted
upon the Â»hort interest in Third Avenue. This
â¢stock touched 66% in the early decline and
reached bS% several times in the violent fluc
tuations of the last half-hour of the trading.
Price changes reached as much a* 1% points
between *alej>. Metropolitan Street Railway re
covered an Â«-arly loss in sympathy. London
bought quite freely of American stocks, es
pecially the Atchlnons and Union Pacific. The
toud purchases on account of all stocks were
f-stimated at 00.000 shares. Relief was man
i?eytÂ»Â»d in the London money market to dis
bursement* on Go\-ernment account. Neither
the easier money in London nor the large buy
ing on London account here had any effect
on the market for sterling exchange, which
held Bteady. New York exchange at Chicago
Jumped to 25 cents premium to-day, compared
with a discount last week and the proportion
of absorption of finds by the New York sub
tre.esury ie much smaller than for the same
period last week. Factors for the relief of the
money market are thus outlined without re
gard to the operation of the new currency law.
Operations in the railroad bonds were active
and strong to-day and well distributed. Total
bales, par value, 53.7?5.n"0. â¢
United States bonds scored a further sharp
decline to-day, suggesting the liquidation of
holdings of recent buyers who are Induced to
take profits en the hiph price*. United States
2s. old 4f and Us declined 1 per cent for the
refunding. 2s whtn Iseued % and new 4s Â»4 In

WHEATâ A decline at Chicago weakened fu

Chicago was weaker owing to an increase of
800,000 bushels on passage, and an increase of
214,000 bushels in the visible supply. Liverpool
reported a two week's supply. The firmness in
Corn alone prevented a further decline. The

CHICAGO. March 19.â Wheat at the opening
was comparatively steady. Mild, j damp
weather was reported from the West, condi
tions ideal for the winter wheat, but traders
at the moment were Influenced by firm foreign
markets and the heavy cash business done
Saturday. May opened unchanged at 67%@67%c,
but offerings soon exceeded the demand at
those flugres and prices began to yield a trifle.
May got down to 67% c. A short spurt of cov
ering brought the price back to 67% c. but soon
after the market again turned weak and de
clined slowly and steadily until within a few
minutes of the close. The liquidation during
the session was not particularly heavy, but
support was lacking, "prospective buyers evi
dently being more impressed with . the favor
able weather, the visible Increase and the
heavy Northwest receipts than were holders of
long wheat. The decline, however, was not
rapid until nearly noon, when the price dropped
quite fast. May finally being hammered down
to 66%fc66%c. During the last half-hour of
the session the demand Improved somewhat
and shorts sold and longs renewed their lines.
May advanced to Â«6%c and reacted to 66%@
66% c, where it closed.
Corn was quiet, but fairly steady. There was
a general belief that Important lines of long
corn were In process of liquidation, but the
market was well supported notwithstanding
this and the weakness of wheat. May closed
>ie lower at 37% c.
Oats were extremely dull all day, nothing
of interest occurring In the speculative mar
ket. Small ciuh demand strengthened futures.
May closed a shade lower at 24j?24%c.
Provisions at times were extremely, active,
especially so as regards pork, the demand for
that article being heavy and general. Small
stocks and higher prices at the yards started
a buying movement early which advanced
â¢prices sharply. May pork selling' as high as
$11 55, but later in the session realizing chopped
off a good deal of the advance, the decline
helped along by the weakness of wheat. Lard
and ribs also showed fair advances at one tlm>?,
but lost them when pork declined. At the close
May pork was 10c higher; May lard a shad?
lower and May ribs a shade higher.

THINKS HE WAS
HYPNOTIZED TO
COMMIT CRIME
Burglar Patterson's Queer
Tale of Mysterious
Companions.
Told the Police He Had No Rec-
ollection of His Predatory
Tour in East Oak
land.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, March IS.
The police have a mystery on . their
hands In the person of Thomas Patterson,
the burglar captured last evening by W.
H. Price. Patterson declares he was hyp
notized by a couple of strangers whom he
met on the ferry-boat yesterday afternoon
while he was,. coming to Oakland. Tho
burglar flatly asserts that he has not the
remotest Idea who were the strangers by
whom he was led by "some Irresistible
force" to go to the Price residence, and
he has likewise as stoutly affirmed that
he did not realize until long after his ar
rest what had occurred.
The tale is somewhat discredited by ihe
detectives who have been trying to Ket
Information from Patterson concerning his
companions who escaped. â¢
Patterson was not under the Influence of
liquor when he was taken Into custody
last night. His only statement concerning
himself is that he is a typesetter and ar
rived here from Klngman, Ariz., a f-Â»w
days ago. In telling his story to-day the
prisoner said:
"I met two men on the Oakland ferry
boat whom I never saw before, and they
Induced me, by some power I cannot un
derstand, to keep company with them
after we arrived In Oakland. Ido not ic
member any of the circumstances about
my arrest, and I was as much surprised as
any one could be when I found myself in
charge of the police! I guess I must have
been hypnotized. I never saw the two
men before in my life, and I could not tell
the slightest fact about them which would
give any information about their 'den
tlty."
Such is the remarkable story which Pat
terson has given to the police. The pris
oner was nursing a very sore head to-day,
the wounds inflicted by the plucky Price
with his trusty poker giving the burglar
considerable pain. He would not even
admit that the drubbing which knocked
him senseless had any effect In freshening
his memory after the hospital surgeons
restored him to consciousness.
The police are holding Patterson as a
"small book" prisoner until they have
completed their Investigations. They have
no hope now of locating his companions
in the face of his peculiar statements.

State Textbook System.
The statement recently made by Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the Uni
versity of California that he believes the
State school textbook system Is wrong
is eorrobomted by Superintendent Web
ster and every member of the Board of
Education. Surwrintendent Webster, in
discussing the subject yesterday, said that
he did not think that Mr. Wheeler meant
that he would rather have back the old
competition among rival book concerns
to supply publications to the public
school* with all the evils of lobbying than
have things po on as they are. Mr. Web
ster thinks that if it be deemed better
that the books should be purchased from
publishing houses rather than from the
State Printing Office It should be the duty
of the. JState Board of Education to let
the contracts and then eliminate the local
textbook fights and consequent scandals.
Mr. Webster Is of the Arm conviction that
the books thus adopted would serve the
purpose Involved in the education of chil
dren far better than the system of State
textbooks now In vogue.

HOW AN EGG HELPED
TO DETECT A BURGLAR
Story of the Arrest of Thomas Wil
liams Told in Judge Ca
baniss' Court.
Thomas Williams was yesterday held to
answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Cabaniss on a charge of burglary in
$2000 bonds, and he owed his arrest to the
sagacity displayed by a woman in drop
ping an egg on the sidewalk from tne
window of her room to attract the atten
tion of a hackman.
Williams early on the morning of March
13 went into the lodging-house at &Vs
Kearny street and tried to enter several
of the rooms. Mrs. Holmes, the landlady,
was awakened by Williams trying her
door, and suspecting that a burglar was

dropped it out of her third-story window
in the hope that it would attract tho at

did.
The hackman. divining that something
was wrong, notified Policemen Silver and

place they discovered Williams in the of

cess of the show. In the rings were George
W. Reed. H. A. Melvin, A. P. Leach and
George E. de Golla. Clay H. Hawbaker
was chief announcer, and he won Ills
hearers with his eloquent description of
the attractions of the concert.
The peanut brigade, headed by W. H. J.
Mathews, kept the crowd busy parting
with its money for their canvas covered
popcorn, chewing gum and real circus
lemonade. There was a real sideshow and
menagerie, with even a baby elephant for
the little folks to enjoy.
The concert programme won a thousand
people and more to drop their dimes into
the Elks' fund. There was a combined
orchestral programme under Louis Ho
mler's leadership, and the Elkfc quartet,
Dick Walsh and Adele Legon, T. Valerga.
Frank W. Thompson, D. Mansfield, Eagan
and McNulty, C. H. Johnson and Louis

monologues, club swinging, acrobatic
numbers and the like.
There will be matjnees Tuesday and
Wednesday, besides the evening shows.
On Wednesday evening San Francisco
Lodge of Elks No. 3 will attend the cir
cus in a body, while many Elks from
Stockton, San Jose and other nearby
cities are visiting town to enjoy the circus.

OAKLAND, March 19.â The Elks'
Circus is a success. | The big tent
at Twelfth and Madison streets was
packed to-night and the ticket sell
ers had to close their boxes early in the
evening, turning away scores of people
who sought admission. Hundreds stood
for hours inside the tent and the enter
tainment fully rewarded the thousands
that were crowded Into every available
corner. The feature of the audience was
the large number of society people who
graced the big show. The success of the
circus was complete. Every promise of
the flaming posters got out by the ad
vance agents was redeemed. The Elks
were out in force and working in every
capacity about the tents. From the
grand entry to the last note of the concert
players this show ran smoothly, without
a delay or hitch.
The day opened with a big street pa
rade, the Elks furnishing their celebrated
country band, led by Charles J. Heese
man, who was assisted by Dr. H. B. Mehr

GARDEN CITY WHEELMEN
SEEKING A RELAY RACE
The Garden City Wheelmen of San Jose
are anxious to again put their fortunes
to the test in a 100-mile relay race over
the California Associated Cyclers' course
around the bay. They insist on an un
paced event as being the truest test of
the abilities of the riders. The matter of
outside assistance to the couriers has been
bitterly debated in the past and has
stirred up much unpleasantness. The
Garden City men Â¦want the ten men form
ing each team to rely on their own exer
tions and not accept a helping hand from
any one. The race has attained such a
place in cycling history that It would be
a pity to allow It to lapse for a single
year.
H. Austin Goddard. well known to San
Francisco racing men, who was the first
representative of the bicycle trust to be
sent to Australia, is being received with
high honors by the wheelmen of the anti
podes. He is being banqueted right and
left, and has made a hit with the riders
and trade there.

SUSPICIOUS CASES ARE
WATCHED IN CHINATOWN
Two suspicious deaths were reported to
the Board of Health yesterday afternoon
and the bodies were at once turned over
to the autopsy physician tq ascertain the
cause of death. The board also paid a
visit to Chinatown, where the deaths oc
curred, and late last night met in special
session to discuss the necessity of taking
extra precautionary' measures pending the
result of the autopsy.
It was decided to request Chief of Po
lice Sullivan to prevent swill and garbage
of any description from being removed
from Chinatown until further notice. Ths
Chief issued orders In accordance with
the request, and the Chinese quarter is
being closely watched.
While it Is by no means certain that
there is any danger to Be apprehended, it
is deemed the part of wisdom to use every
precaution to prevent any spread .of a
possible Infectious disease.

WHEELER ASKS
RAILROAD FOR

A Through Express to Run
From the Mole to Berke
ley Twice a Day.
Too Many Small Stations Accom
modated and East Berkeley
People Belayed, Says the
President.
c
BERKELEY, March IS.-Presidem
VS heeler of the University of California
Has asked the Southern Pacific Company
to run special accommodation trains from
the mole to Beikeley each morning and
evening for the students of the university.
It 18 proposed that two through trains, at
7:80 and S:3O o"clock In the morning, and
two evening trains be put on for the ex
clusive uae of the students.
President Wheeler consulted with a
number of prominent Berkleyans regard
ing the proposed arrangements and met
with considerable encouragement. He
then called upon the head of the Alanieda
division and Â»et the entire matter befura
him. A letter was received by Dr. Wheel
er to-day stating that at present the sug
gestions made by him could not be ful
filled. A larger equipment will be neefcs-
Bary and a new time schedule made. Pres
ident Wheeler was promised, however,
that some concession will be made. The
student trains may not stop at any station
before Golden Gate, the other stations be
ing covered by the West Berkeley local.
"The train service is very inadequate
at present," said Dr. Wheeler, "for the
large number of men and women stud
ents v.-ho live in San Francaco and are
compelled to cross the bay each day.
The trains now stop at every little sta
tion on the road, whether there are pass
engers for it or not. The students are
consequently delayed reaching recita
tions.
"We appreciate that the railroad will
be at considerable expense and may not
do anything for some time. I have re
ceived a vÂ«ry courteous letter, however,
stating that as soun as some arrange
ments can be made the accommodation
\rtll be made.
"The railroad people have made the
concession that the East Berkeley local
do not stop at any station until it
reaches Golden Gate. The West Berkeley
local will accommodate passengers be
tween the mole and Golden Gate. That,
of course, is some advantage and may
be accepted by us.
"Arrangements cannot be perfected for
a student express at present, owing to
the limited number of tracks at the mole.
If our express were put on it would have
to be placed ahead of the local In order
to get started first. The local would then
be filled first, so that will not do.
"As soon as equipment can be secured
and tracÂ«i facilities arranged I have no
doubt that a student express will be run."

National Union.
The various local councils of the Na
tional Union have of late been quite act
ive. Golden Gate Council initiated two
strangers. California Council four. Pacific
Council five. El Dorado thirteen and
Union one. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . - Â¦Â¦
The entertainment that was given last
week by the National Union Social
and Literary Club was exceedingly
well attended, a positive proof of the pop
ularity of these entertainments. Under the
management of W. W. Healey. B. A.
Kldd, J. N. Bunting and F. H. Hastings,
who have Insisted that no one shall be
admitted except upon the invitation of a
member of the order, with the under
standing that the party invited must be
such that the one extending the Invitation
would not hesitate to invite to his own
home, the attendance has been limited to
a most desirable class of people. The pro
gramme was an excellent one, decidedly
entertaining and reflecting credit on the
good Judgment of the gentlemen who have
charge of the socials.

OAKLAND ADVERTISEMENTS.
WILL AGAIN
HAVE A CITY
GOVERNMENT
A Call Has Been Prepared
for an Election in-
Placerville.
Owing to Trouble Over Railroad
. Bonds the Municipal Officers All
Resigned Twenty-Seven
Years Ago.
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« CalL
- PLACE RVILLE, March 19. â Hon.
Charles A. Swester. Prentiss Carpenter
and Fred Irwin, -all prominent attorneys
of this city, who compose the commission
recently appointed by Governor Gage to
reorganize the munlciapl government of
this city, will on Wednesday issue their
proclamation calling a municipal election
for Tuesday, April 17. to elect a full set of
cHy - officials.
The reorganization of the city govern
ment ends the long contest between the
citizens of this city and the holders of the
bonds voted by the city of Placerville in
1863 to aid the construction of the railroad
from Folsom to Placerville. Thirty-four
thousand five hundred dollars in bonds
was issued at that time, but the com
pany failed to build the railroad to Placer
ville, stopping at Shingle Springs, twelve
miles from Placerville, and the city gov
ernment refused to pay either principal
or interest on the bonded indebtedness.
Early in 1573 the officials of the city all
resigned, and for twenty-seven years Pla
cerville has had the anomalous experience
of being a city without a single city offi
cial. â¢
In October last 108 citizens of the city
united Id the execution of a joint note for
the sum of $36,315 25, a . prominent San
Francisco bank advanced the money upon
the note and the money was used to pay
the railroad bond indebtedness of the
city. A new series of bonds will be issued
by the new city government, which will
be subscribed for by local capital, and the
citizens' note paid. ,
The railroad bond indebtedness of the
city amounted in principal and accrued
interest to over $281,000. The compromise
was effected on the basis of paying the
principal alone.
Citizens of all classes are overjoyed that
the long struggle is over and all predict
that the historic little mountain city will
now enter upon a new era of prosperity.

BURGLAR HORTON
TRIES TO KILL
A FELLOW-CROOK
Row Over Division of Spoils
Leads to a Shooting
Scrape.
In a Moment of Anger He Whips
Out His Revolver "and Fires .
Three Shots at "E"Â«
\ Pal.
George Horton, ex-convict, crook and
all around bad man, made a desperate
effort yesterday afternoon to add murder
to his already long list of crimes. Sus
pecting that his pal, a crook named Mc-
Callum, had given him the "double
cross," Horton fired three shots at him,
but without effect. The shooting occur
red on Minna street, near Fourth, and
was witnessed by a number of people.
. Horton seeing his intended victim dis
appearing unharmed down Minna street,
passed his revolver to a confederate
named Edward Hawthorne and started
to make his escape. Both he and Haw
thorne were captured after a short chase,
but McCallum got away.
The prisoners were taken to the. City
Prison and booked on charges of* assault
to; commit? murder. . The revolver which
was used was- not found by â¢ the police.
It Is supposed that Hawthorne, seeing his
escape was impossible,--' threw it away in
the hope, that it would not fall into -the
hands of the police. â¢ â¢ . â¢ â¢
Horton . a short time ago was arrested
for .having counterfeiters' -tools in his
possession, but was acquitted after a trial
in Judge de Haven's court. .His confedr
crate, a man named Gray, who was ar
rested with him, was found guilty of t,hÂ«
offense. â¢ After his release Horton picked
up with a desperate crook, who Is known
to the police as the "Squirrel," but whose
right name is said to be McCallum. It
was the latter that Horton tried to mur
der. . ' â¢ Â¦'Â¦"Â¦Â¦
According to the detectives Horton and
McCallum are the men who have been op
erating-in the -Western Addition during
the past month. Horton was recognized
while leaving a house on Sutter. street a
few nights ago after having ransacked it
with the aid of the "Squirrel." The. po
lice were at once notified, but Horton
managed to keep out of their way until
yesterday. , â¢ - !
The police say that the attempt of Hor
ton to murder his pal was the upshot or
a quarrel . between the two men over a
division of booty. . Horton positively re
fuses to make a statement, and In the ab
sence of McCallum., who up to midnight
had succeeded in eluding the detectives,
the real cause of the shooting could not
be ascertained. Some time ago Horton
had a row with a fellow housebreaker
and was shot in the foot. His assailant
was convicted of an assault Â¦to commit
murder and sentenced to ten years' im
prisonment In Folsom. - Â¦ : >
â¢ Late last night - Horton confided ". to a
friend that he would set up the defense
that the "Squirrel" slashed at him with
a razor and thinking that he intended to
kill him he drew his revolver and fired.
A short time before the shooting Police
man Tillman saw s Horton and Â¦ the man
whom he tried to kill quarreling at Fourth
and Minna streets. -They were about to
come to blows, when Tillman crossed over
to where they were standing. They, at
once disappeared* In opposite directions,
but evidently i returned ito the spot after
the officer left, and* the shooting resulted.
ABOLD attempt was made during
Sunday night and early yesterday
morning to rob the vault of the
French Savings Bank at the corner
of -California and Webb Btreets.
Considering the fact that the California
street police station is situated next door
to the bank. It is plain that the would-be
robbers were not lacking in nerve.
Yesterday morning William Koehler, a
collector, who occupies an office in the
bank building directly over the vault, on
entering his office found a large strip of
carpet torn from the floor and a hole cut
through the flooring large enough to ad
mit the body of a man. Koehler immedi
ately notified the police at the station next
door, who In turn reported to the chief of
detectives. Captain Bohen detailed De
tectives Byram and Whlttaker to Investi
gate the robbery, and the officers worked
all day on the case without gaining any
clew that would lead to the capture of the
baffled robbers.
In their report to the captain_the_detec;
tives said the men had evidently forced the
door of Koehler's office and by driving a
bit into the casing fastened the door in
such a manner as to prevent it being
opened or unlocked from the outside. The
crooks were evidently acquainted with the
premises, as was shown by "the aperture
made in the flooring, it being directly over
the vault and In such a position that ac-
hinged cover which can be tightly closed, that
hereafter no garbage be collected or transported
within the city limits except between the hours
of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m.
CORRECTLY QUOTED.
Bey. J. A. B. Wilson Maintains His
Position on the Tobin Ordinance.
Dr. Wilson, being interviewed to know
whether he considered himself fairly
represented as to remarks, published in
yesterday's Call, upon the Tobin resolu
tion, as to whether he wished to modify
his statement, said:
"You reported me with perfect accuracy
and I do not wish to modify the state
ment in any particular.
"The remark was based upon a possible
contingencyâ or rather upon an impossible
one, for I do not for a moment suppose
that a vote by any Supervisor against the
resolution upon its final passage is a pos
sibility. Especially after the frank ac
knowledgment of one of their number
that, though not.a betting man, he should
feel constrained to vote againÃt it lest, he
feared, the sporting traternlty who sup
ported his party might by such action
be driven from it. This is an ac
knowledgment of everything charged in
my severest statement. And the statement
was made to show the logic of this un
tenable position. It is due the gentleman
to say he spoke without preparation and
upon the spur of the moment. In other
words, this was a severe case of 'talking
through his hat,' and was the premise
furnished by himself of my conclusions.
That he means to thus sell out to 'sure
thing gamblers' for either past or future
support at the polls Ido not believe. I
have a better opinion of him and the
others than they seem to have of them
selves. My conclusion is a perfectly legi
timate Inference from such. a speech. I
believe I voted for the unfortunate
speaker and for almost all the others. I
believed them to be honest men who
would give to the city an honest adminis
tration. I know that they know that there
is only one side to this resolution that an
honest man can by any possibility take,
and I believe that every one of them will
take that side next Monday.
"I expect to be there and see them
honor themselves and the city which has
honored them, and so serve notice upon
dead-game gamblers to move on. These
men know that in every poolroom, upon
every racetrack and in every gambling
house and cafe every game Is a clrch
game. These people have long enough
held up the youths of this city and broken
the hearts as well as robbed the wlvea
and mothers and children. .We have no
chance gaming here, but sure-thing gam
bling and the Supervisors know it, ond
they know, when they think It thoroughly,
that their colleague, Mr. Tobin, has fully
covered the whole situation In his resolu
tion, and, like the honest men I bellevo
them to be, they will support the resolu
tion If my remark, which I still main
tain was irritating, it was a legitimate
conclusion from the premise furnished by
one of their own number bringing them
face to face with the logic of the speech
and of the situation. Both the speaker
and his colleagues on the last analysis will
not stultify themselves nor shame their
constituents by playing into the hands of
cinch cut-throats."
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
took the initial etep in what promises to
be a determined effort to bring telephone,
teiegTuph and pneumatic service com
panies under the control of the municipal
government la the fixing of rates to be
charged to the public. A resolution was
Introduced by Reed which is Intended to
supply hii omission in that section of the
charter relating to kindred concerns,
whereby It is proposed to submit an
amendment to the qualified electors of the
city and county. The resolution was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee to as
sure the legality of Its phraseology and
.s as follows:
Resolved. That tse Board cf Sopervltors
of the city and county of Ban Franclsoo
hereby propose to the qualified electors
of the city and county of San Francisco
that Subdivision 11. Section 1, Chapter
S. Article 2. of the charter of the city
and county of San Francisco be amend
ed to r.-ad at- follows:
~Eubdi\t!!ion 11. To fix and determine
by ordinance in the month of February "
of eacii year, to take effect on the first
day of July thereafter, the maximum.
rates of compensation to be collected by
i-ny person, company or corporation in
the city and county, for the use of wa
ter, beat, y.pht. power, telephone, tele
graph or pneumatic eerrice. supplied to
the city arid county, or to the Inhab
itants thereof, and to prescribe the qual
ity of the service."
Farther resolved. That the attention
ef the Election Commission be and Is
hereby culled to this resolution.
The only change in the section Is the
addition of the words "telephone," "tele
graph" and "pneumatic service," which
places such corporations In the same cate
gory as water and light companies. The
ordinance prohibiting pool selling was to
bave coma up for final passage, but
through an error in the official advertis
ing the matter wai postponed until next
Monday. Supervisor McCarthy addressed
the board regarding the published account
of Rev. Dr. Wilson's sermon of last Sun
fiay night, in which the clergyman said:
"Watch the board on the final vote
of Â¦ the poolroom order, for mark my
word, not one man will vote against It
or 6<-ek to have it amended who is not
bribed to do so." Â¦
"I desire to state," said McCarthy,
"that this statement is a malicious lie. I
Intend to vote against this order, not be
cause I believe in pool selling, for I think
that it should be regulated, but because
the prohibition in not well directed. In
doing 60 I deny that I have been bribed."
Supervisor McCarthy was followed by
liutaling, who sternly said:
"1 voted for the order when it was
passed to print, but I will now vote
againfit it. I believe that there are
among pool sellers more liberal minded
men than among some gospel sharps, who
axe trying to run the city."
The ordinance declaring a public nui
sance the railroad operated by the South
ern Pacific Company along Harrison
Ftreet, from" Seventeenth to Twenty-sec
and. thence to Valencia, thence to the
southerly bounflary line of the city and
county, was passed to print. The ordi
nance provides for the abatement of the
nuisance as follows:
That if within thirty days from date of the
j>aÂ»si.Ke of this ordinance tbÂ« Southern Pa
cific Hallway Company afxees to discontinue
the maintenance and operation of said railroad,
tht-n the Southern Pacific Railway Company
may continue the operation and maintenance of
Eaid road between eaid points without hind
rance or molestation, until July 1, IS3I.
It is then provided "that It within thlrtr
days from date of the j>a>taee cf this ordinance
mid Southern Pacific Railway Company shall
not have filed the apreement tfie Board of Pub
lic "Works shall immediately after the expira
tion of said thirty days proceed to take up and
remove all tracks and rails of said railroad be
tween Seventeenth street and the county line,
and prosecute the work of taklrr up and re
moving all tail tracks and rails without de
lay."
The ordinance further provides that If
the company flies the agreement men
tioned, and the rails shall not have been
removed on or t>efore the Ist day of July,
ISOI. then the Board of Public Works shall
proceed to take up the rails, and that It
shall be unlawful for the company or Its
successors to operate the road thereon
after July 1, 1901.
Supervisor Fontana asked that the mat
ter be referred to the City Attorney to as
certain if the Board of Supervisors has
power to remove the rails, but the motion
Â¦was lost. Supervisor Maguire, chairman,
of the Street Committee, stated that the
company had no franchise from Sixteenth
to Twenty-second street on Harrison,
and only a private right of way to Twen
ty-fifth strait. The attorney of the cor
poration had himself admitted to the com
mittee that it had no franchise.
â¢"Eighty thousand people," said Ma
iruire, "are interested in this ordinance,
and it would be an Injustice to them not
to pass it. The company has been Â«ndea
Â¦vortng for years past to get a double
track franchise, because It did not pos
eess one for a single track. Many school
children are obliged to travel in the vicin
ity of the tracks and the street car lines
sxe obliged to' cross the rails at various
points."
Supervisor Reed, chairman of the Public
Utilities Committee, presented a resolution
requesting the Spring Valley Water
Company to offer for sale to the city on

burled, and these were interred In the Na
tional Cemetery at the post. They were
kept, awaiting orders from relatives for
over two months, and they were buried
only after an order trom Washington. Of
the 500 that came on the Hancock and In
diana there remain but a few, and these
will probably, be buried by the end of this
month. i
Target practice, either for small arms or
ror great guns, will not form a prominent
part of this year's post routine. Hereto
fore the special attention of the depart
ment headquarters and also of the army
headquarters has been given to this
branch of the service. Range work with
small arms has been especially fostered,
but this year, by orders from headquar
ters, all target practice will be under the
direction of the post commanders and at
their discretion.
Thls order has been caused by the un
usual scantiness of the various garrisons.
There is not a post in the country that is
even fairly manned, and many of them
have no more than Just enough men to
care for the property. At the Presidio
Just now there are only about men enough
to keep the guns clean and not enough
even to mount the new ones that are
being brought in from the East.
w There are two big twelve-inchers on
hand now waiting to be mounted at
Lime Point, but the garrison at that place
is not equal to the task, as it is not
large enough, and the guns will therefore
be mounted by. contract.
; In the order regarding target practice
it la directed that as much carbine and
revolver practice as may be practicable
be held by the cavalry before May 1, and
as much rifle practice for the artillery as
may be practicable before October 31.
The duties of post chaplain at the Pre
sidio will be temporarily attended to by
Chaplain J. A. Potter, who has been on
duty at Angel Island. For some time
Chaplain Macomber. who was retired In
the middle of February, remained at his
work, but he has been relieved by Chap
lain Potter. It was reported that Chan
lain Pierce, who came from Manila wiTh
the body of General Lawton, would be
the permanent chaplain to succeed Chap
lain Macomber, but it looks now as if
Chaplain Potter will get the assignment.
AFTER a tedious morning session of
the Fair case yesterday, with Mrs.
Gllleran on the stand, a bomb ex
ploded in the afternoon when E. R.
Rock, secretary of the Grand
Jury, was called to produce the
famous contract entered Â¦ into I between
Mrs. Craven-Fair and Louis F. DunanJ.
Mrs. Gilleran, dressed in holiday array
and ready to present an ever ready armor
of resistance to the cross-questions of
Garret McEnerney, proved the same Im
pregnable witness as he battled with last
Thursday. But Mrs. Gilleran was not the
sensation of the day. The afternoon ses
sion, rich in developments, completely
overshadowed the morning, and once
again the contract of Mrs. Craven and
Louis F. Dunand was brought to the fore
ground, this time to be read in open court
and produced tor the cognizance of tha
attorneys of the Fair heirs.
"When the afternoon session began a sur
prise was sprung by Garret McEnerney.
who has lately taken the helm of cross
examination, relieving Skipper Plerson,
who formerly distinguished himself as
chief among the Fair forces.
"We would like to have E. R. Rock
put upon the stand," said McEnerney,
and that gentleman mounted the witness
box to the call. This was unexpected and
the sensation that followed was in keep
ing with the looks of supreme Importance
aftected by the FairÂ«counsel. All that was
obtained from Rock, secretary of the
Grand Jury, was the contract entered into
between Louis F. Dunand on one side and
Mrs. Craven-Fair on the otherâ a paltry
$30,000 was the consideration. The docu
ment was not entered in the records, sim
ply because McEnerney and his auxiliary
force of counsel did not wish it. W hen
Mrs. Craven-Fair appears upon the scene
âThursday is. the day set for her reap
pearanceâthe court will be asked to label
this contract among the exhibits of the
case and then the fight over Silva. Du
nand, Mrs. Craven-Fair et al. will begin
anew.
The Fair attorneys promised to anni
hilate Mrs. Gilleran when she appeared
upon the stand yesterday morning. That
witness, smiling, with a candor that was
outsticking, buffeting the tide of a se
vere examination by McEnerney, cling
ing steadfastly to her testimony given last
week and holding her own fort with a
resolution that did not pale, was the same
intractable person that the defense at
tempted to submerge at the las^t preceding
session. Nothing came of the morning
session but Incontrovertible dissatisfac
tion' for McEnerney.
One thing, however, he did elicit from
Mrs. Gilleran, and that was the admis
sion that Fair asked her to conceal the
knowledge of his admitted marriage. This
seems to be the new tack of the Fair at
torneys. Evidently they have the Sharon
decision in mind, which postulates the
law of contract marriage, declaring that
not only is the contract an essential, but
that the parties must be living in open
and notorious wedlock. This single fact
was established by McEnerney in his
rigid cross fire, but he seemed satisfied
with it and allowed the witness to go her
way soon after his questions secured the
desired answers. â¢
E. F. Rock, bright star of a dull day.
was the next witness called. All that was
wanted of him. was the contract which
Louis F. Dunand and Mrs. Craven-Fair,
by their joint efforts, worked out for their
own mutual benefit. McEnerney, Pier
son. Wheeler. Heggerty, et al. were blis
tered with a i edhot anxiety to see the doc-
PRISONERS ESCAPE ON A
MERE TECHNICALITY
Mrs. Dora Fuhrig, Samuel Newman
- and Stephen Vaccari Dismissed
by Judge Cook.
By virtue of a decision rendered by the
Supreme Court, In which it Is held that
"a dying declaration Is not admissible In
evidence in a criminal prosecution unless
the circumstances show it to have been
made under the belief of impending
death," Mrs. Dora Fuhrig, a notorious
midwife, under conviction on a charge of
murder In the second degree, and Samuel
Newman. and Stephen Vaccari, under In*
dlctment for the murder of Su Ela Tyson,
were dismissed from custody by Judgts
Cook yesterday. The dismissal of tne
prisoners was the result of a motion made
by Assistant District Attorney Deuprey,
who stated that it was impossible to se
cure a conviction of the defendants under
the recent Supreme Court decision in the
case of Mrs. Dora Fuhrig, in which the
Judgment was reversed on the grounds
named.
Mrs. Fuhrig was convicted of the mur
der of Anna W. Walmsley on December
29, 189 S. .The deceased made a dying dec
laration in which she said that Mrs. Fuh
rig caused her death, but as the declara
tion was written by O. H. Heynemann and
only subscribed to by the deceased, whom
the circumstances proved was not in im
mediate fear of death, the Supreme Court
held that It was insufficient upon which
to base a verdict of guilty and reversed
the Judgment of the lower court. As the
prosecution depended solely on the dying
statement of Su Ela Tyson in the cases
against Newman and Vaccari the court
granted ' the motion to dismiss and the
three defendants are now at liberty.
Â¦ Although Mrs. Fuhrig has escaped pun
ishment on what may be termed a "tech
nicality." her conviction. has. to a certain
extent frightened those engaged in a sim
ilar criminal occupation;' and for a time
at least they will refrain from practicing
their, chosen vocation. : ';t- .:
ument and they did seÂ« It. Much xephyr
ous argument waa wasted upon Judge
TtouH about the propriety of having tne
paper read before the court. McEnerney
explained that all he asked for In tha
wide, wide world was to get a copy of this
document. He hoped the court would ad
journ long enough to allow the reporter
to copy it, as counsel on the other alde>
had agreed. The Pence freres were very
much opposed to the reading of the con
tract, but It was finally settled by the
courtesy of one side and the forbearance
of the other, so the contract was copied
and read off for the respondents, that they
might know Just what was the condition
of things.
The arbitrament resulted In the contract
being read. It ran verbatim:
Louis F. Dunand. attorney at law. 603
California street. Clunle building, corner
Montgomery, telephone Main 5332.
SAX FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 1339.
This agreement, made and entered Into
this Bth day of August. A. D. 1339. by and
between Mrs. Nettle R. Fair and LoulÂ»
F. Dunand. witnessed:
That whereas. Mrs. Nettle R. Fair, the
Â¦widow of James G. Fair, deceased, claims
certain portion of his estate, and whereas,
said claim Is denied and the same la litiga
tion, now, therefore, for and in considera
tion of the services heretofore rendered
and to be rendered by Louis F. Dunand
aforesaid ' as counsel and attorney for said
Mrs. Nettle R. Fair now pending In the
' courts of the State of California, the said
Nettie R. Fair will pay. and by thesÂ«
presents agrees and promises to nay to
said Lnuis F. Dunand, or his order, upon
judgment or recovery, compromise or other
wise by her of her claim or claims as afore
said, the full and true sum of $30.0>Â».
NETTIE R. FAIR.
In consideration, of the foregoing. Louis
F. Dunand promises and agrees to render
such legal services in the above entitled
matter as may be' necessary to enforce the
rights of said. Nettle R. Fair.
LOUIS F. DUXAXD.
(Indorsement.)
This belongs to A. Sylva. Sausallto, Hariri
County, Cal.
When Mr Rock nnished his labors on tnÂ»
stand he left with a haste that even the
bailiff could not equal when he tried to
bring him back at the call of attorneys.
The contract Is in writing and Is signed
by both parties. Mrs. Nettle R. Fair and
Louis F. Dunand. It is said that Dunand
testified before the Grand Jury that ha
was not a party to the contract, but that
he acted merely in behalf of Sylva. Tha
indorsement which it was claimed was
a bona fide assignment to Sylva is written
in lead pencil and Is unsigned by Dunand,
but without signature. And so the com
plication becomes more and more muddy.
Louis F. Dunand will have much to ex
plain ' when he appears before the court,
especially as his former testimony was to
the effect of an absolute assignment.
Mrs. Craven was not present yesterday
when the case was pending. Had sha
been there she would have been called
upon to Identify the Instrument. The at
torneys for the Fair heirs have asked for
her presence again and she will soon make
her reappearance on the stand.

Buch an offer of sale must be accompa
nied by the placing in escrow of a deed
to lte entire system, dependent for deliv
ery upon the acceptance of the offer by
the people voting at a special election to
be held in the year 190 L
The resolution calls the attention of the
water company to the fact that any over
valuation of the system will compel the
city to look elsewhere for Its water sup
ply, and that the withdrawal of San
Francisco as a market for the sale of the
company's water will reduce the value cf
the lands owned by it for agricultural
purposes
Keed also introduced an amendment to
his first ordinance regulating boxing ana
sparring entertainments, which v,-as
passed to print. The two ordinances do
not differ in any .essential particular, and

permission to decorate certain streets to
be designated by the Street Committee
on the occasion of the national Chinese
festival In the month of June, 1900, and to

may be adopted.

order that provision therefor may be made In
the next tax levy.
An ordinance was passed to print imposing a
license of Â£3 per year for carrying concealed
weapons, permission for which must be ob
tained from the Police Commission.
An amendment to the license ordinances im
peding a license of ?2Q per quarter on runners
and soliciting agents and fixing the price of
badges at {1 Â£0 was parsed to print.
The Tax Collector was instructed not to issue
a free licence without the approval of the

from the street.
The vault reaches to within four feet of
the -celling:, and' from Its top a wooden

sight- When they quit work, whether
through being frightened away or other
wise, they took time to pack ! most of
their tools with them, as the only things
found by the- detectives were a small bit,
a bundle of wire and a small "Jimmy.
The bank building has many means of
exit, and the men found no trouble in
making their escape.
In their search for a clew the detectives
found a boy who volunteered the informa
tion - that ne had seen a man prowling
about the roof of the building at 504
Kearny street,- which adjoins the bank
building, and when asked his business he
said he was a line repairer. At another
house on Kearny street a similar report
waa made of a strange man on the roof.

found the Job a longer one than they an
ticipated and were compelled to give It up
for lack of time. The damage done is
