BOER LOSSES AS REPORTED FROM PRETORIA.
. NEW YORK, March 19.â The Sun has the following from Pretoria, March 15, via Lourenzo Marques, ' March â¢'â There
Is a large number of Boers on the western border of the Transvaal, in the neighborhood of Mafeking. and that town Is sur
rounded by a very strong cordon, through which, the Boers say;, it is impossible for, the British to break. The Federal forces
are disputing with the greatest vigor an attempted advance toward the Transvaal of a British force from Kimberley. ... 7~

HUNDREDS OF FREE STATERS
HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS
The San Francisco Call/CONSTANTINOPLE, March 18.â After prolonged delibera-
I tions upon the Russian demands for exclusive railroad
I rights in Asia Minor, the sublime Porte has proposed a
**-^ compromise, whereby the railways would be constructed
by Turkey and Russl-i in partnership. The Russian Embassy
insists upon the original demand, which the Turkish military
commission strenuously oppose.
BERLIN, March IS.â The St. Petersburg corresopndent of the
Neuste. Nachrichten says: "Russia, although tacitly encour
aging the champions of Bulgarian Independence, does not con
sider the time propitious for action. She hopes to bring pres
sure to boar upon Turkey in the railroad question, but should
she fail to obtain the required concessions Important events
may be expected In the Balkans. The repatriation of the
Armenian refugees still furnishes Russia with a good diplo
matic weapon wherewith to obtain her demands."
â¢The several lines or railroad now in operation In Asia
Minor, with one exception, are controlled by German compa-
nles that have already obtained liberal concessions for large
and Important extensions. One of these, the Anatolia Railway
Company, will extend Its present line from the Bospho
rus, on which It njw terminates at Konleh, through, via
Marash and Bagdad, to Bassorah on the Euphrates, near the
Persian Gulf. The French company which owns the line from
Smyrna to Afinn-Knr ahlssar. was placated by a grant of 40
fier cent of the shar S in the extension. There is a provision
n the concet-jiui. ...uch gives the Turkish Government the
right to purchase the line at any time.
Few railroad lines can be of greater prospective Importance
than this 2000 miles of railroad which will unite the Persian
Gulf with Europe, forming rapid transit to and from the Far
East, and opening up large tracts of rich agricultural coun
try. The ownership of the road of course earrtes with It the
commercial supremacy throughout the country tributary there
to of the nation controlling it. Germany fully understands the
situation and will undoubtedly hold to the last the advan
tages she has gained. . . -

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG.
Prevents Many People From Trying
a Oood Medicine.
Stomach troubles are s*o common and ln
most cases so obstinate to cure that peo-
ple are apt to look with susplcfon on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acutenefs In never being humbug^e-J, es-
pecially In medicine?.
This fear of being humbus-ffed can be
carried too far, so far, in fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak dices-
tion rather than rick a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's I>yspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different ln one important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines, for
tho reason that they are not a pecret
patent "medicine; no secret is madÂ» of
their ingredients, but analysis shows them
to contain the natural digestive ferments*,
pure aseptic pepsin, the digestive acids!

fore it has time to ferment, sour and c^use
the mischief. This is the only spcrot of
their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure Indigestion and stomach trouble
because they act entirely on the dowels
whereas the whole trouble Is really <n the
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all theie i*
to it. Food not digested or half-digested
Is poison, as it creates gas acidity, head-
aches, palpitation of the heart, loss of

DELEGATES WILL BE
SOLIDLY FOR BRYAN
Very Probable Results of the Demo
cratic and Populist Conven
tion in Nebraska.
LINCOLN. Nebr.. March IS.â While
there may be a few family fights in the
Democratic and Populist conventions
called for to-morrow night to el*Â»ct dele
gates to the convention at Kansas City
and to thp Populist convention at Sioux
Kalis, they are not expected to have any
influence upon the final action of both
gatherings, which will be to select Bryan
delegates and instruct them to vote for
him first, last and all the time. It is ex
pi-cted that there will be sharp struggles
in the afternoon caucuses for the position
of delegate at large ln the Democratic
convention, but whoever wins the result
will be the same. The man who gets a
place on the Nebraska delegations will
be a Fhouter for W. J. Bryan.
Much interest is manifested regarding
thÂ«Â» platform to be adopted by the Demo
cratic convention. It v:IH be drawn up
under the personal supervision of Mr.
Bryan, and is understood to be his
declaration of the platform which in his
opinion the national convention at
Kansas City should place beneath the
feet of Its Presidential nominee. The
platform to-morrÂ«w will be an affirmation
of the Chicago platform, will contain

two rounds. Cass hit Whidden and
knocked him against some weeds. He
tripped and fell and just as he fell time

Cass Is Counted Out.
Whidden wanted to fight for pointa, but
Cass , to a finish. After almost finishing
the f eighth round Whidden struck Cass be

seconds were counted. He was carried to
one : side, rubbed and cold- water poured
upon him. Ray Cass, a brother, got' into

He only lived a short time after the fatal
blow. His death occurred at about 11:43
o'clock.
The body of Cass was then taken to his
home on Windham street and the scene
was a sorrowful one. The parents were
just returning from the Methodist church,
of which their boy was also a member.
Whidden went to town with Dr. Plant
and gave himself up to Sheriff Besse. He
was held by the Sheriff for. about three
hours and released on his own recogni

MAY INCREASE TARIFF
ON AMERICAN GRAIN
Compromise Offered German Agrari-
ans Who Seek to Bar Pickled
Meats.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyright, 1900, by the New York
Herald Company.
BERLIN March IS.â The Frankfurter
Zeitung learns that the Government has
made an offer to the Agrarian party that
if it will abandon its position aa to the
importation of pickled meat, duties on
American grain will be raised after the
expiration of the commercial treaty.
The duty on wheat will be increased
from 3 marks 50 to C marks per double
centner.
On the subject of the meat Inspection
bill a semi-official Hamburg correspond
ent publishes the following leading
article:
"It is certain that Americans will not
quietly accept the, limitation, or, to speak
more correctly, an' absolute prohibition of
the importation of meat.
"We must reckon with counter meas
ures on the part of the United States,
which will do immense damage to our
commerce and shipping. It la true that
for years past American -commercial legis
lation has been run on such lines as to
give us" little reason, when drawing up
customs regulations for Germany, to pay
any particular regard to American trade.
In fact, in certain quarters reprisals are
even called for against the treatment of
German Imports to America, but even If
such reprisals should have any chance of
sucesss It would be a mistake to give ex
pression to them ln the form of prohibi
tion of Imported meat instead of extend
ing them to general commercial legisla
tion, for by introducing special legislation
of this character we give Americans not
only a pretext but a right' to tax German
commerce."

forces. A detachment of ISO men, with
two field guns and two Maxims, under
command of Major Durr, left Kalochau
February 11, with orders to protect the
lives and property of Germans in the
Hineterland. Germany has been prepar
ing for this move for months. Mining con
cessions and other privileges have been
obtained In the interior and Germans
sent there to operate them. They have
frequently been assaulted and Insulted, by
natives stirred up by the great antl-for

Missionaries have received the same
treatment so often that complaints to Ger
man authorities at Kalochau were of
weekly occurrence. The sending of armed
forces Into the Interior will likely result
ln German occupation of a large part of
that province.
NINE PERSONS INJURED IN
NEW YORK TRAIN WRECK
Coal Chute at a Station Drops Down,
Demolishing the Engine Cab
and Cars.
NEW YORK, March 18.â Nine persona
were injured eaxly this morning in an ac
cident to a Ninth avenue* railroad train
near Rector street. Five are'severely'ln
jured, and one, David A. Flndley, fe nt
the Hudson-street hospital suffering: from
a fractured skull. The most seriously In
jured besides Flndley are: Richard B.
Barlow of Yonkers. engineer of the trrJ.ii,
scalp wounds and shock; Thomas* Shelvey,
an engineer, internally Injured: Alfred
Alexander, salesman, Internally injured
find taken to the hospital unconscious;
James Manning, laborer. Injured about the
head.
The train left South Ferry for Harlem
and passed the Battery-place station at its
usual speed, and was- approaching the
coaling station. The engineer did not need
coal for his engine, and so did not signal
to the' man in charge of the coaling ap
paratus. In an unexplained fashion; al
though the coal man says that it was
through the vibration caused by the ap
proaching train, the coal chute dropped
down -almost' at the -moment the train
reached the station. The chute struck the
roof of the cab and tore it off, at the same
time throwing down Engineer Barlow and
Fireman Hutchings to the floor of the
cab. Barlow's hand was on the throttle
at the moment of the collision, and a.-" h*
fell his hand turned on the pressure -till
more, and the engine dashed ahead at full
speed up the track, stopping only when It
had reached Barclay street because of th<*
exhaustion of the steam. Meanwhile the
chute had wrecked the roofs of the pas
senger cars, and the dozen passengers la
them were thrown ln every direction.

MACHINISTS
DECLARE THEY
WILL STRIKE
All Parts of United States
and Canada May Be
Involved.
Chicago Labor Troubles Responsible
for Disagreement Which Threat
ens to Tie Up Many Large
Establishments.
?
CHICAGO, March IS.â After the confer
ence between representatives of -the In
ternational Association of Machinists and
the Administrative Council of the Na
tional Metal Trades Association. Presi
dent Junes O'Connell of the union de
olared that strikes would be called im
mediately in ail parts of the i:nitÂ«*d
States and Canada. Such strikes would
involve 100.000 men and cause to be phut
down for an Indefinite time plants having
an aggregate capacity of millions of dol
lars.
Chicago labor troubles are responsible
for the disagreement which is expected to
precipitate the general machinists' strike.
Were it not for the fact that the lead
ers of the MachlniPl*' I'nion refused to
call cflf the strikes" that now exist in Chi
cago, Columbus, Ohio, and Patterson, X.
J., the manufacturers and the leaders. It
is believed, would have come to an ami
cable agreement and arbitration would
have been permanently established be
tween the National Metal Trades Arso
ciatien and the International Association
<>f Machinists. The members of the ex
ecutive board of the Machinists" Cniott
refused, however, to caU off the strike,
as they declared that if they did the Chi
cago local would secede from the Inter
national association. When the refusal
of the machinists to end the strike was
presents to the manufacturers they is
sued an ultimatum to- the labor leaders,
and on their refusal to agree to Its pro
visions all negotiations were broken off.
Threat of the Union.
Before leaving the rooms in which the
Joint conference was held President
James O'Connell of the International
union declared that th*> union would be
pin Immediately to call strikes ln all
parts of the country. The flrst of these
etrikes will be called In Cleveland, Ohio.
After all the lars;e cities have been tied
up strikes will be called in the machine
phops of all the railroads in tho country.
Representatives of fourteen firms
throughout the country were present at
the conference. After meeting in separ
ate conferences all the afternoon the
manufacturers and the labor leaders be
gan a joint meeting at 6 o'clock, at which
the manufacturers submitted tor the ma
chinists a proposal for arbitration. ThÂ»*y
asked that all strikes and lockouts l>e
called off pending the arbitration of the
difficulties by a committee consisting of
the presidents of the two organizations
and two members from each association,
whose decision shall be accepted as final.
On the second proposition the two as
sociations were united. The labor leaders
refused to agree to the first proposition
and submitted a demand for immediate
and separate arbitration of the Chicago
difficulties. This the manufacturers re
fused to ratify and the conference broke
up. both sides making what amounted to
a formal declaration of war.
RUSSIAN RAILWAY SCHEME
BLOCKED BY THE SULTAN
MANILA NOW
A HOTBED OF
CONSPIRACY
Insurgent Junta Is Giving
General Otis Consider
able Trouble.
Assisted by Spanish Residents, tho
Filipinos Are Reorganizing
in the Province of
Moronga.
MANILA. March IS.â General Otis con
siders Manila the most troublesome center
ln the situation to-day. The Insurgent
junta here, in conjunction with that in
Hongkong, is growing active. The mili
tary authorities have been forced to put
a stop to Mabini's Intercourse with the
public. The local and foreign " press con
eiders his recent utterances calculated to
incite the Filipinos to a continued revolt
and prejudicial to American control.
Florcs, who has just arrived here, says
he conies trusting to American leniency,
and he would not have dared to come to
Manila if Spain were yet ln control. He
cherishes tho hopes and aspirations wh'.ch
actuated him when ln the field, and de
sires to watch Congressional action upon
the question of the Philippines. The in
surgents, he says, do not expect to van
quish the Americans, but are maintaining
a resistance with the Idea of forcing Oou
gress to accord them the best possible
terms.
A number of representative insurgent
leaders from dlffernt parts of Luzon have
recently been In conference in Manila.
Some have been placed under arrest, but
the others thus far have not been inter
fered with. Louis Spitzel, head of the firm
of Louis Spitzel & Co., contractors of the
Chinese Government and himself a sus
pected filibuster, came from Hongkong to
Manila last week and was temporarily de
tained in custody on suspicion.
It is asserted upon good authority that
three loads of arms and ammunition have
recently been landed on the east coast of
Luzon. Captain Taylor of the Thirty
ninth Regiment recently captured twelve
new Mausers near Calnmba.
Atrocities of Brigands.
Reports are current here of active rebel
reorganization in the province of Moronga.
where the Insurgent leaders are said to b>
assisted by prominent Spanish residents.
Inhabitants of this province who are now
in Manila have boen advised not to return
to their homes, but to remain under tho
protection of the Americans. It is also re
ported that the rebels are reorganizing In
the province of Zambales, under Mascnr
do. Brigands are committing atrocities
ln the province of Xueva Eciga, \vhtrÂ«?
they have murdered twenty natives anl
Chinese. Eight other murders have be+>n
committed near Tarlac. The Nueva Kdgi
insurg-ents are heavily taxing local traders
and farmers, with the result that business
is paralyzed and there is a general scar
city of food. The funds for maintaining
this guerrilla warfare are collected from
the various towns of the island, whether
occupied by the Americans or not, even
including Manila.
In the pro%-ince ofAlbay the insurgents
have ceased harrasslng the AmericnnH,
owing, it is reported, to a lark of ammu
nition, but they continue ravaging tl.e
country by burning" and looting. The na
tives are tiring of this sort of, thing and
threaten to . turn against the marauders.'
Already the townspeople of Legaspl, -Al
bay and Donzol are slowly returning to
their homes.
Major Allen of the Forty-third Regiment
has been appointed military governor of
the island of Samar, where Lukban. the
former leader of the rebels In that local
ity, is still in the mountains.
General Kobbe has opened twenty pcrts
in the Southern part of Luzon and in th^
islands of Samar and Leyte. the result of
which is to stimulate trade there, al
though only temporarily, as : the country
opened is non-productive and apparently
non-consuming. Owing to the \^ ! tkul
conditions of the last twelve VR-ntbs
products accumulated during the Dlock
ade. These will be shipped to Manila and
then the ports will be empty.
Treason of Officials.
Evidence accumulates of the treason
and perfidy ot the municipal presidents in
the provinces of General Mac Arthur's
district. The presidents of several towns
in Lepanto and Union provinces have de
clined to continue in their positions, saying
that they do not desire any further iden
tification with the Americans. Travel be
tween the towns garrisoned by the Ameri
cans is becoming more dangerous. AH
wagon trains must be escorted by heavy
euards in order to insure their safety.
Two ambushes were narrowly averted re
cently. Small traveling rarties are at
tacked. Single travelers frequently disap
pear or are found dead.

This is the first time the sentence of
death has been passed upon natives by
Americans. The action of the military
tribunal is calculated to suppress out
rapes by bands of outlaws, but is criti
cized in" some quarters as being prema
ture, owing to the fact that the insur
pent^s have sixty American prisoners in
thrir hands. They may retaliate by. ex
ecuting some of these.

6pÂ«ctal Dispatch to Tho Call.
TACOMA. March 13.â A small British
force tn North Borneo last month de
stroyed three forts ocnpled by the brigand
Matt Selleh and 300 Borneo rebels. The
British constabulary, under Captain Har
rington, dragged a seven-pounder into the
forest with great difficulty.
The rebels had retreated Â¦ before them,
taking a stand ln three forts surrounded
by strong stockades. During a heavy fog
Harrington's men pulled their gun to 'the
top of the hill commanding all three forts.
When daylight opened the gun was* placed
In action, with the result that one fort
was soon on fire. Several shells had pene
trated through the- thin roof, and bursting
had killed many rebels.
The gun was next directed at fi. fort oc
cupied by Selleh. He Immediately ordered
his men to climb up and unroof It In an
endeavor to prevent the fort from catch-
Ing fire. This fcaved Selleh's fort for but
half an hour, as the seven-pounder nearly
annhllated It before the British ammuni
tion became exhausted. In the meantime
Selleh and his men had retreated, leaving
their dead and wounded behind. Another
supply of ammunition has been forwarded
into the Interior from Labuan,. where it
wa3 left by a British gunboat, and the
campaign against Selleh will be continued.

WASHINGTON. March 18.â It now looks
as though the week in the Senate would
be spent largely in waiting upon the spe
cial Republican caucus committee appoint
ed to harmonize the party on the propose.l
Porto Rican legislation. The Porto Rican
governmental bill will continue to hold its
place on the Senate calendar as the un

If there was hope of passing Jt soon.
Senator Mason has given notice of re

sympathy with the Boers on Monday, but
pays he does not desire to speak upon It
The Senate leaders consider his resolution
unwise at this juncture.
To-morrow is District of Columbia uav

NOTED ENTOMOLOGIST
GOES TO HIS LAST REST
Death of Andrew Bolter, Who Was
Recognized as an Authority
on Insects.
CHICAGO, March 18.â Andrew Bolter,
one of the most noted entomologists in
America, and for forty-five years a resi
dent of Chicago, died to-day.
Although regarded as a high authority,
Mr. Bolter contributed no books to scien
tific literature. He frequently, however,
In response to requests for information
from Instructors and students In insect
life, wrote lengthy letters on various
phases of the subject, and his reputation
for practical knowledge was widespread.
He was a member of the Academy of
Sciences In Chicago and of the New York
Entomological Society.
From boyhood until a few years before
his death, at fcO years of age, Mr. Bolter's
uuiei pursuit outside of business hours
was the collection of Insects. His col
lection of beetles, butterflies and other
Insects of Innumerable kinds, said to be
the finest on the continent and one of the
most complete private collections in the
world, will probably go to the University
of Illinois.
Mr. Bolter, who was born in Sigmerin
gen, left Germany because the Govern
ment resented his connection with the
revolution of 1848.

in the summer of 1897 General Lockhart

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"They certainly are." he replied. "Cigar
leaf is grown on a large scale in New
Hampshire. Vermont, Massachusetts, Con
necticut. New Jersey. New York, Penn
sylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida. Geor
gia and Texas. The domestic manufac
ture of cigars represents $100,000,000 of in
vested capital, $150,000,000 worth of annual
product, pays 125.000 persons $60,000,000 in
wages yearly and consumes $50,000,000
worth of tobacco and other supplies,
mostly produced in the United . States.
Under tropical free trade this vast domes
tic industry would be largely transferred
to Havana and Manila, where wages are
but a fraction of those earned by Ameri
can cigar makers.
"The citrus fruit industry ,of California
alone represents $50,000,000 and thousands
of persons. The vegetable Industry rep
resents an annual product of equal value.
Lying at the very door of our home mar
ket, Cuba, Porto Rico and Jamaica could
pay full duties and still undersell domes
tic producers. Cotton culture and manu
facture in the Orient will have great im
petus under coolie labor. Cuba has al
ready asked for a protective tariff against
Louisiana rice. Although -TÂ»oolen manu
facturers are making more money than
ever, lower duties on wool are sought
through a reciprocity with .Argentina.
The culture of sugar beets at the north
and west and of sugar cane at the south,
and the manufacturer of sugar therefrom
would be wiped out by tropical free trade.
This Is one of the most promising agri
cultural and manufacturing industries,
and farmers are determined to have this
home market for $100 .000,000 worth yearly
of this new and profitable crop. Such a
policy is best for the country.
Protest of the Farmer.
"For instance, under the reciprocity
Porto Rico Increased her consumption of
flour only 15 cents per capita yearly for
her 1.000 .000 people, while the beet sug&.r
industry, if developed only enough for lo
cal consumption, would put $2 50 Into the
pockets of the people of Minnesota and
the Northwest. The beet sugar Industry
is now so lar developed in New York,
Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Virginia, Illinois lowa, South Dakota, Ne
bras-ka, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico,
Washington. Oregon and California that
to sacrifice it to tropical trusts would be
a crime. To-day, therefore, the American
farmer says to Congress:
" 'I have supported protection for other
Interests; now I want them to support
protection for the farmer. If fruits, sugar,
tobacco, vegetables, etc.. are to be ad
mitted free from Porto Rico, Cuba or tha
Philippines, then admit free manufactures
from England and Europe. If duties on
the produce I have to sell are reduced 12
to 2<3 per cent by reciprocity, then make
it a like reduction on the manufactures I
have to buy. So long as there is protec
tion I want my share of it. especially on
those things upon which a duty will re;:lly
protect. Don't subject me to free trade
conditions. and expect me to vote protec
tion for the other fellow.'
"The farmer's position is impregnable.
It is just. He asks no special favors â
only to be treated equally as well as the
labor and capita! in other industries. It is
significant, also, that the farmer Is sup
ported in this position by labor, which is
the chief consumer of his products. Work
ers In other vocations know that when
the farmer prospers all industries thrive."
"But how can Porto Rican products be
excluded if it is a part of the United
States?" .
"Domestic producers bitterly resent rs.
tablishing a precedent for Porto Rico that
must inevitably be applied to Cuba and
tne Philippines later. We prefer to avoid
the constitutional issues for a few years
by leaving Porto Rico as a military pos
session, *with a civil government within
the President's direction. The present
military tariff admits foods. Implements
and ether necessities free of duty 'nto
Porto Rico. Instead of taxing these, like
other articles. 15 per cent, as proposed in
the House bill pending in the Senate, we
would let It stand as it present. A jo'nt
resolution authorizing the President to re
duce somewhat the duties on Porto Rlcan
produce shipped into the United States Is
all that Is now needed since the big ap
propriation for Porto Rican relief has
passed. This would afford the Islander*
every facility for getting on their feet
again. As a matter of fact, they can pay
full duties to get into the United States
and still make more money than American
farmers and not work half as hard. This
will also give our statesmen abundant
time to decide upon the government for
Porto Rico."
Not a Party Issue.
"What is the attitude of domestic pro
ducers toward Cuba and the Philippines?"
"Treat them alike. Help the Filipinos
to self-government and nominal indepen
dence, as the United States is doing in
Cuba. This will be vastly better for our
foreign trade as well as for our domestic
interests, and at the same time will wipe
out the economic, constitutional and
moral questions involved In Imperialism.
When this is accomplished Porto Rico
might come In as a territory, but not be
fore. With justice toward all. the whole
mass of complicated Issues growing out
of the Porto Rican affair would thus be
disposed of. An Increasing number of
Senators and Representatives of both par
ties favor this proposition. I believe it
will yet be carried out."
"Will the people approve?"
"The party that walks this plank will
win hands down next November." replied
Chairman Myrick. "The people will never
submit to the competition of yellow la
bor. Some alleged sympathy has been in
dustriously worked by the Porto Rican
lobby at Washington, which is headed by
a British vice consul, who Is not even a
citizen of Porto Rico. When this whole
case is fully understood the American
people will take the position now held by
the League of Domestic Producers. This
is a matter of self-preservation, not of
politics, with the American farmer and
workingman.
SPRINGFIELD. Mass.. March IS.â "The
most serious politico-economic contest
ever witnessed in the United States may
yet grow out of the Porto Rican affair.
The grfat hubbub it has already created
is but a faint prelude to the uproar that
may follow the present effort to sacrifice
American farmers to tropical monopolies.
Yet there is a very simple and Just way
to avoid this and many other threatened
difficulties."
So said Herbert Myrick. chairman of the
League of Domestic Producers, in an in
terview yesterday. The league is a new-
Jy-formed coalition of the various agricul
tural, labor and manufacturing Interests
endangered by tropical competition, and
represents more than 3,000,0Â» voters. The
change of front by the administration at
Washington is attributed largely to the
League's recent petition and memorial to
Congress. Mr. Myrick said:
"The sugar refiners' trust depends for
3ts very life upon imported raw Eugar.
Its death knell is sounded by the devel
opment of domestic beet sugar produc
tion, as well as by other competition; the
trust's shares have sunk almost one-half
in market value. But if the sugar refin
ers trust can get raw cane sugar admitted
â¢duty-free from the tropics it can throttle
the domestic beet sugar industry and
realize profits beyond the dreams of ava
rice.
"The same is true of the tobacco and
cigar trust and the tropical fruit trust.
These powerful interests, together with
the Spanish landlords and speculators
â¢who have acquired lands in Porto Rico.
Cuba and the Philippines, are the influ
ences that are exerting such tremendous,
nut artfully concealed, pressure in behalf
of free trade with the tropics. If th^y
succeed vast syndicates will be perfected
to employ coolie labor on the unlimited
fertile soils of those islands in producing
pujrar. tobacco, fruits, vegetables, rice,
cotton, etc., as well as cigars, cotton cloth
and other manufactures, at prices that
Â¦will frreatly undersell domestic products
unless wages and living in this country
descend to a level with the tropics.
Hawaii's Coolie Labor.
Hawaii afford? striking proof that this
is Just what will happen. She has im
ported T>o.nM coolies and doubled her sugar
production within a f^w years, largely
pince annexation. Java and EfO'Pt pro
duce sugar at a cost that laughs at tar
iffs. Last year about half the sugar im
ported into the United States was pro
duced by yellow laborâ double the propor
tion of five years ae:o. The American
farmers and workiiiKmen realize that
protection against th<> products of coolie
labor is now as essential to self preserva
tion as were the Chinese exclusion acts
of the United States and Australia."
"But are the domestic industries! threat
<pr:ed of any particular consequence?"
Mr. Myrick was ask.-d.

Â¦ Â¦
WASHINGTON. March IS.â Tn official
and diplomatic circles here a denial la au
thorized of published reports that there
have been conferences with a view to the
dispatch of additional warships and
United States soldiers to China, and that
news of the gravest character has been
received from the United States Minister
to China. There Is said to be no fears en
tertained that any serious danger to
American interests is Impending.
It is suggested that the published re
ports have as their basis the recent artlon
of the Navy Department, made public at
the time through the Associated Press,
in directing Admiral Watson, who is
in command of the naval forces
in the Philippines, to send a
warship to the port of Taku. at the mouth
of the Pieho River. This was done as a
result of the representations made to tha
State Department by Minister Conger,
who reported that serious attacks had
been made upon the American missions in
Shantung by the "Boxers." a powerful
and numerous anti-foreign league of Chi
nese. Secretary Long said to-night this
was all that had been done by the Navy
Department, and he was not yet aware
which of his vessels the admiral had de
cided to send to the Chinese port. Tha
Secretary further denied emphatically tha
correctness of the publication, so far as
the Navy Department was concerned, and
added that there had been no conferences
on the subject, such as were reported as
having taken place.
Acting Secretary Meiklejohn of th*
War Department was as emphatic in de
nying the accuracy of the publications a*
affecting his department as Secretary
Long was regarding the Navy Depart
ment. Mr. Meiklejohn specifically stated
that there had been no conference with
Assistant Secretary Hill as to the num
ber of troops that could ba spared from
the Philippines for service in China.
Embassador yon Holleben of Germany,
whose name is -also identified with tbe
publication, was about to go out to keep
an engagement as a reporter met him at
the door of the embassy this evening, rio
acknowledged that he had seen the Secre
tary of State recently, but said that Cht T

Attempted Train Wreck.
CLEVL.AND. 0.. March 13.â An attempt
was made to wreck the Lake Shore fast
mall, west-bound, leaving here at 10
o'clock to-night. At Olmstead Falls,
about twenty miles west of here, a rail
had been laid across the track. The en
gineer saw the obstruction in time to ap

WAR REVENUE
BILL WILL NOT
BE CHANGED
Proposed Amendments Will
Probably Die in
Committee.
Members of the California Delega
tion in Favor of Alterations,
but Unable to Secure Any
Action.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
WASHINGTON, March 18.â It is the
opinion- of the California delegation In
Congress that no action will be taken at
this session on any of the proposed
amendments to the war revenue act.
Great pressure has been brought to bear
on the Ways and Means Committee of
the House and Finance Committee of the
Senate to report favorably to the respec
tive bodies on the large number of bills
and resolutions looking to amend the act,
which have been introduced and referred
to these committees since Congress as
sembled. This has been especially true
with reference to the propositions for the
repeal or amendment of the provisions of
the war revenue act relating to the tax
on express packages, telegrams, proprie
tary medicines and other minor charges.
On the other hand, such strong influences
have been at work, and thus far success
fully, to prevent any modittcation of the
present law or the repeal of any of Its
provisions by this Congress that there is
practically no hope of legislation affect-
Ing the matter during this session
Senator Perkins' Views.
Senator Perkins said to-day: "we are
not so -sanguine aa to favorable action
by either house. There are so many pro
posed amendments before the committees
having the matter in charge affecting so
many different Interests that It does not
now seem probable any disposition will
be made of them and that they will die in
committee. Regarding the express war
revenue stamp case before the Supreme
Court, many good lawyers believe the
court will hold that the express com
panies should pay the tax. It is, quitÂ©
certain, at all events, that Congress will
not now legislate concerning these ques
tions of internal revenue contained In cer
tain provisions of the war revenue act."
Representative Loud said: "Any at
tempt of our delegation to secure favor
able action on any proposed amendments
would prove futile. The sentiment of the
California delegation is undoubtedly
unanimous as to the question of the ex
press stamp tax, but so far as Congress
is concerned it is the policy of the Re
publican party in both houses to favor no
legislation at this session that in any way
affects the war revenue bill."
Representative Waters Bald: "I have
always favored making the express and
telegraph companies pay the stamp tax,
but it is agreed, apparently, by leaders In
Congress that no change in the law- is at
present possible.
De Vries Unsuccessful.
Representative de Vries, > when asked
for his views regarding the effort to se
cure action of Congress, said: "I have
written to Mr. Payne, chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, many times
urging a favorable report on the pro
posed amendments In his committee, and
have always received the reply that no
action will be taken at the present session.
All arguments and pressure possible have
been brought forward, but nothing will be
done by the House so long as the leaders
are oposed to doing anything In the mat
ter."
Representative Kahn has had experi
ence similar to that of others of the dele
gation. He said: "I have appealed to
Chairman Payne repeatedly on behalf of
my constituents, but always got the re
ply that no action whatever would be
taken on amendments to the revenue bill.
I favor making the express companies
pay the tax. but bo far as Congress Is con
cerned nothing can be done about the
matter this session." Â¦
The views of Senator Bard and Messrs.
Barham. Needham and Metcalf would be
only a repetition of those of the rest of
the delegation. . ."

TRADE STILL FEATURELESS.
THE trade situation is characterized by continued
Umeness. In the whole commercial field there
is not a feature worthy of note, except the recent
passage of the currency bill, which, by increasing the
circulation, was expected to immediately enliven spec
ulation in Wall street, but which it. did not do after
all, as the street continues sluggish. Apparently
seme occurrence out of the ordinary would be neces
sary to start business out of its present inanition.
Yet the situation is not unsatisfactory- True, the
bank clearings ,of the country are still falling behind
those of last year, the figures last week showing a de-
crease of 12.4 per cent, but the failures were oniy
190, against 205 in 1899. The markets, however,
lack that snap which distinguished them throughout
1899. There is little desire to speculate and stocks of
2!most all commodities are large and increasing. The
distributive trade is uncertain, being brisk in some
quarters and dull in others. The tendency last week
was toward higher prices for farm products and
quieter markets for manufactured goods. Cotton still
stands at high-water mark, prices for the raw product
being the highest since 1893; but there is less dispo
sition to order goods ahead, owing to this very condi
tion. Wool rules dull, owing chiefly to the recent
decline at London, and the mills are still turning out
krge quantities of fabrics without buying any raw
wool. Hides and leather continue weak, and the
former are quoted demoralized in almost all markets.
Corn, which was remarkably active for a few days,
shaded off somewhat at the close of the week, and a
flight advance in wheat was checked in sympathy. At
the same time, wheat conditions are now rather point
ing to better prices, the weather being unfavorable in
several important countries. Iron and steel show
rrther less easiness, though there is still more or less
talk about lower quotations here and there. The
minor metals are generally firmer.
Conditions in this State remain unchanged. The
south is still looking for rain, while the north is hop
irg for continued clear skies. One condition about
balances the other, so prices for farm products re
main undisturbed, as a rule. Wheat has taken a little
turn upward in sympathy with Chicago, but the other
cereals are dull and nominal, with ample stocks on
hand. Provisions are weak and much quieter than
for some months, and sharp competition among local
dealers prevents the market from improving in sym
pathy with a better feeling in the West. Hides, hops
and wool continue very dull. The livestock market
keeps up better than any ether line in the commercial
list, and this seems to be the stockman's era. Dried
and canned fruits are quiet, but with the exception
<-,i prunes both' descriptions are well cleaned up. The
season thus far has been remarkably propitious for
fruit, and unless we get frosts later cm the crop this
year will probably be too large for ease in handling.
General business conditions remain as before. Money
is plentiful, collections are normal and failures are
certainly not over the average. There is a good ship-
jiing demand for those articles usually exported from
San Francisco, and prices are steacty as a rule. The
city was never on a better commercial footing than

THE SHIPPING BILL.
S-INCE the main contention of the opponents of
the shipping bill has been that its terms would
give advantage to trusts or to large combinations
of shipbuilders or shipowners in competition with
smaller firms or individuals engaged in the business,
it is to be expected the opposition will diminish now
that the House Committee on Merchant Marine and
Fisheries has agreed upon amendments designed to
prevent such combinations.
The hostility against the bill has been the more
bitter because it is the last fight possible for free trad
ers to make against the protective system. To all of
the industries of the country, with the sole exception
of shipping, abundant protection is now given, and
the results have been so widely, so generally and so
greatly beneficial that no political party will ever ven
ture to assail the system during this generation. As
yet the shipping industry remains without adequate
support from the Government, and it is the last strug
gle of the free traders to keep it in that condition.
Our merchant marine is as much entitled to protec
tion as is any other industry of our people. That,
much may be deduced from the principle of common
justice. At this particular juncture, however, the
argument in favor of a liberal shipping bill has a
special force derived from the fact that the rapid in
crease of our exports requires an increase of'shipping
to carry it to markets beyond the sea. At the pres
ent time we pay an enormous tribute to British ship
owners to carry our commerce for us, and therefore it
will be a matter of economy as well as of justice to
build up our industries on the sea as well as those on
land.
In a recent report on the restoration of the Ameri
can merchant marine, a committee of the National
Association of Manufacturers says: "Last year there
were three tons of shipping built in Great Britain for
every single ton built in the reH of the world, and
we Americans would very much like to see that sort
of thing reversed. It would mean the steady and re
munerative" employment; of thousands, of, persons,, it
would mean the profitable investment of millions -of
capital, it would mean immense expenditures for sup
plies and materials. The iron and steel manufacturers
would feel the life-giving influence of the enactment
of the measure. The miner of the ore and coal and
limestone, which are used in the iron furnaces, would
feel the effect of the new policy on the part of the
Government. The farmer who raises the grain and
meat to feed the thousands of additional workmen,
who would secure employment in the process of pro
curing all these various supplies for the shipbuilder,
would receive his share of the benefits."
The issue has long been before the country. \ The
powerful foreign commercial interests in our great
seaports have been hostile to every effort toward up
building an American merchant marine, and the peo
ple of the interior have been. indifferent to a measure
in which they have felt little self-interest. The time
has now come when we may reasonably expect the
foreign antagonism to be crushed and the indiffer
ence at home to be overcome. According to the esti
mates of Senator Frye we are paying 'to foreigners
about $1,000,000 a day for carrying our international
commerce, and since that commerce is so rapidly in
creasing it is surely time to provide for an American
merchant marine to carry it.
"THE PUBLISHERS' BURDENS."
UNDER the title "The Publishers' Burdens,"
there has been sent out from Washington a cir
cular urging newspaper proprietors to write to
their Congressmen protesting against the passage of
what is known as the "second class mail matter bill,"
introduced by Mr. Loud and designed to put an end
to certain abuses which exist under the present postal
laws. The circular is signed "Publishers' Commit
tee," and closes with the announcement: "The pub
lishers have no lobby and no money to spend in pre
senting this matter to individual members, and the
only thing that will defeat the bill is each publisher
writing individually to his Congressman."
If the "publishers" who are profiting by the ease
with which they are now permitted to abuse the priv
ilege of second class mail rates have no lobby nor
any money with which to make the fight at Washing
ton, then all reports on the subject from the capital
have been grossly in error. Some of the publishers
make enormous profits out the privilege, and if they
have not expended a part of them in an effort to con
tinue the privilege, they have been less enterprising
than any other set of men that ever managed to get
the best of the Government.
The circular makes a "cunning misrepresentation of
the nature and the object of the bill. It is described
as a blow at legitimate newspapers and magazines,
whereas it is of a directly opposite nature. The priv
ilege of sending certain classes of matter through the
mails at low rates, known as "second class," was de
signed by the framcrs of the present bill to facilitate
the circulation of newspapers and literary, religious,
industrial and scientific periodicals among the people.
It has been taken advantage of by the publishers of
advertising circulars, cheap novels and other stuff
of that kind. These people issue their circulars or
their novels once a week or once a month, call them
"periodical publications," and under that title get ad
vantage of the low postal rates designed for legitimate
newspapers. and magazines.
The issue is not one which newspaper men should
consider from the standpoint of their trade interests
solely, yet if they should do so they would be none
the less in favor of the Loud bill, since legitimate
newspapers are perhaps the heaviest sufferers from
the effects of the abuses which have grown up under
the law. The cunningly framed circular of the Pub
lishers' Committee, however, is calculated to deceive
editors into a belief that their interests are threatened
by it. Thus it declares:
"The aim of Mr. Loud is to finally model our postal
laws after those of monarchical countries, which Mr.
Loud visited and investigated during the past sum
mer. In foreign countries the publishers have no
privileges not extended to merchandise of all kinds.
The result is there are a few publications of enormous
circulation and practically no weekly papers like our.-,
which have made the United States the most intelli
gent country in the world. The second class postal
laws of the United States to-day are not as favorable
to the publishers as those in force in Canada and
Mexico, and yet Mr. Loud proposes to take a step
backward and toward the usages of imperialistic coun
tries."
For all, that tirade there is no particle of excuse m
the Loud bill. It is not an attempt to set up a mo
narchical postoffice, nor to transform the United
States into an imperialistic country. It ?imply pro
poses to prevent men from loading down the mails
with tons and tons of advertising dodgers, patent
medicine circulars, gold-brick prospectuses and a lot
of other stuff of the kind, under the pretense that they
are periodical publication?.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI* MONDAY, MARCH 19, 1900.
Eski-Sher to Konieh, thus preventing extension of
both the Smyrna-Afion-Karahissar and the Smyrna-
Aidin-Dinair roads. The two great .distributing
pointsâ Constantinople and Smyrnaâ are . thus con
trolled by Germans, and German goods may enter
the interior of Asia Minor and the great valley of the
Tigris and the Euphrates on German controlled roads
at a decided advantage. Germans have obtained the
right to build docks and warehouses at Haida Pasha,

German freight cars may be sent across the Bosphorus
and travel; to Mesopotamia and the confines of India
and Persia without change. Goods from the United
States and other countries will' have to be trans
shipped at Constantinople or Smyrna, and will be con
sequently at a disadvantage.".
These prospects, so brilliant with promise for the
Germans, are now clouded by the swift advance of
Russia upon Persia. It is even said the Russians
have obtained control of a harbor on the Persian Gulf
outside the Straits of Ormuz. If that be true it will
be perceived that the value of the German railways
will be largely diminished. It is therefore not likely
that the Kaiser will maintain the strictest reserve as
to the questions pending between Russia and Turkey.
It is more likely that, relying upon the countenance
of Great Britain, he will support his right to the rail
way concessions and do his best to preserve for them
a free port as a terminus upon the Persian Gulf.

TURKISH RAILWAY CONCESSIONS.
r~"Â«v[S PATCHES from Europe have during the last
I ) two or three days had much to say concern
*â^ ing the movements of the Russians toward
Persia and an alleged attempt on the part of the Czar
to prevent the construction of a railway through the
Turkish empire from a point on the Mediterranean
to a port on the Persian Gulf. While these reports
are doubtless exaggerated, there is probably some
foundation for them, as Persia has now become
a strategic point for commerce as well as for mili
tary or naval operations.
For a long time it has been known that a railway
across Asia Minor, passing down either "thÂ«
Euphrates or the Tigris Valley, would be an enter
prise of large profit to any nation sufficiently strong
to protect it and sufficiently alert to develop the
country along the. route. To obtain a concession for
the desired road Great Britain, France, Germany,
Russia and Austria have long contended. Until re
cently their mutual antagonisms prevented cither com
petitor from succeeding, for the Turkish Government
did not dare to favor one in face of the opposition of
all the'others." S.hortly after the Kaiser's visit to Lon
don, however, the concession was given to Germany,
evidently by arrangement with Great Britain, and now
the Russians have made terms with Persia, which
seem to show a. determination on their part to fore
stall Germany and get to the Persian Gulf first.
White the advance on Persia has been construed in
this country as a Russian movement against India and
Great Britain, it is in reality a much more serious
menace to German interests. It appears to be so re
garded in- Germany itself, for while the' semi-official
organs of the German Government have taken occa
sion to say that the proposed Bagdad railway is to be
wholly international, and that Germany would main
tain the strictest reserve in regard to questions pend
ing between Russia and Turkey, the Munich Neueste
Nachrichten, which is seemingly not bound by offi
cial restrictions, asserts plainly that Great Britain has
consented to co-operate with Germany in upsetting
Russian plans in AsialMinor.
'. The interests of Germany in the matter are much;
greater than those of any other nation. For years part
Germans have taken ah active part in the industrial ',
and commercial development of Syria and Asia Minor,
generally,. and have large interests there. The State
Department recently issued a report from Consul
Jewclt at Sivas,' Turkey, in which, after giving an ex
tended account of , German railway enterprises either
completed or about to be undertaken in that region,
the Consul says:
"It is not difficultto see how German}*, with prefer
ential rates for goods on German lines, will be able to
control the chief markets of Asia Minor and invade
the -East. Germans purchased the Constantinople-
Ismid. Railroad from an English company and ex
tended it to Angola. They also checkmated the
Kh and English by extending their line ; from

; In 1860 it required a crew of fourteen men

the present time four men are all that
are required to handle a 6-lnch quick-fir

The British battleship Glory recently
passed through her eight-hour steam trial
under full power. The revolutions aver
aged 107.6, working up to 13,745 horse
power, or 245 in excess of contract. Four
runs were made over the measured mile
course, giving a speed of 18.124 knots. The
coal. consumption was exceptionally low,
being only 1.5S pounds per unit of horse
power per hour.
The British Admiralty has decided not
to re-boiler the Hecate,' but to strike her
from -the effective list of armored ships.
The" same course will probably be follow
ed In the" cases of .the Cyclops, Gorgan
and Hydra. These vessels, built in 1872,
are useless for . war '. purposes, ; and the
London Engineer suggests that they be
sold to some South American republic,
provided one foolish enough can be found.
The comparative defensive, value of the
several kinds of ship armor is very nearly
as follows: Six-inch Krupp armor as now
being made is equal to 7&-Inch Harvey
lzed nickel, equivalent to 9-inch Harvey-
Ized or 12-inch compound, 13-inch steel
and 18-inch wrought Iron. These relative
values Indicate the vast saving In weight
of armor the Krupp product has resulted
in since IS9O. Armored ships built at the
present time can either save 50 per cent
in' weight of armor or, by; retaining the
former weight and thickness, a protec
tion of 50 per cent more than that of the
Indiana, Oregon and Massachusetts, built
only six years ago, may be. obtained.
The British Admiralty has at last to re
duce its effective fleet on paper by the
removal of the Warrior, Black Prince and
Belleisle, ironclad ships, and the Boadl
cea, cruiser. The Warrior:. was built in
IS6I and has only 4V2-inch Iron plates on
her sides, insufficient _ to prevent a six
pounder, from penetrating : this * alleged
armor at 2000 yards. The Black Prince,
built in 1862, is similarly , protected with
4"i-inch iron, and the Belleisle, purchased
in IS7S, has been a lame duck for the past
ten years. The ' Boadicea was built in
1575 and has been unserviceable ; for ? sev
eral .years. All ; of the vessels mentioned
became antiquated with the : introduction
of improved armor and. modern engines.
.Russia, guards her naval secrets more
successfully, than any other Â»naval power.
.Very few details leak out during the con
struction of ships, -which may- be due to
the fact that the authorities are not quite
sure' how the'ships will turn out until
completed. There is the Askold, building
at Kiel, begun, as a protected cruiser of
b5OO tons,. which. It now appears, has been
increased to 7964 tons,' and the question
presents itself whether the ship is to have'
anarmor belt or is to use the extra' l464
tons for coal carrying. As .this" would
materially increase the draught of 20 feet
8 inches, the only solution of the conun

CAPTAIN JOSEPH B. COGHLAN. U. S. N.
EDITOR The Callâ Dear Sir: In
your issue of Sunday, March 11. 1900,
page 9, there i 3 a very pretty de
scription of the United States reve
nue cutter McCulloch, which as a liter
ary production does credit to its author,
but which as a historical record is en
tirely wrong in its essential parts.
That part which so prettily states that
at Manila the McCulloch stuck her little
WHITE, inquisitive nose into everything,
etc.. Is true, except her "nose I .* was not
white, but the whole vessel was of a light
olive green or drab, the Asiatic squad
ron's war color; "that she simply turned
her guns loose and threw a few pounds
of lead at the Spaniards, which pounds
were, by the way. PART OF THE FIRST
CHARGE FIRED BY THE AMERICANS
IN THIS GREAT BATTLE." That part
in capitals is also pretty, but misleading,
and if it means or intends to convey
the impression that the McCulloch
fired the. first saot .in the Manila
campaign, or even, at. the battle of
Manila proper, then it is not only mis
leading but entirely untrue! My attention
has been called two or three times be
fore this to the fact that several of the
coast papers have credited the McCulloch
with having: fired the first shot In that
campaign, but never before have I seen
It in print. In Justice to the Raleigh I
must enter my protest against your ar
ticle, for the Raleigh fired the first and
also the last gun of the Manila cam
paign. The fleet passed into Manila Bay
May 1, IS9B, at 12:05 a. m.. by the Boca
Grande entrance, passing within 800
yards of El Fraile rock. The whole
force of vessels were strung out In line
at that time. The Olympla was In the
lead, next the Baltimore, the Raleigh, the
Petrel, the Concord, the Boston in suc
cession, and following the Boston and
nearly in her wake was the reserve squad
ron, the' McCulloch, the Zafiro and the
Nanshan. As the vessels were 400 yards
apart, that would have put the McCulloch
(If she and all others were up to their
proper places) 1600 yardsâ nearly a mile â
astern of the Raleigh.
The Olympia and the Baltimore both
passed El , Fraile rock without drawing

The Raleighs, however, desire to hayÂ»
any honor or glory belonging to them,
hence we always are ready to tell any
one whom it may Interest that the Ra
leigh was lucky enough to flre the first
American shot In that campaign, the last

fire but as the Raleigh got nearly abreast
of it I while on the bridge directing th*
turn of the ship, saw a flash of fire on tha
rock and spoke of It. when Lieutenant F.
L. Chadwick told me he had Just before
seen another, and before we were through
â¢peaking of it a gun was fired from that
rock, the shot passing over the after part
of the Raleigh, or between her and tho
Petrel. Two more shots were fired in
quick succession from that battery, when
I gave permission to flre in return, and
the after "5" rapid-fire gun on the star
board side of the poop deck of the
Raleigh fired, the first American shot in
the far East. '
Afterward the Concord and Boston
fired, and as near as I could learn thÂ«
next day or two the McCulloch's small
guns fired while the Boston was firing,
so that we in the lead did not even hear
her guns.
And, another mistake In your article,
there were no guns fired from Corregidor.
The only guns flr*>d by the Spaniards
that night were fired from Ed Fralle bat
tery. The battery on Corregldor Island
was on its north side (we passed its
south side), and was never fired AT ALL.
except one gun In which a shot was
Jammed, fired by Lieutenant Hugh Rod
man, U. S. N., when he was ashore on
May 3. IS9S, destroying the batteries at
tho entrance to the bay.
The Raleigh and Baltimore, under my
command, obtained the surrender of
those batteries on May 2. and tha Ra
leigh and Concord, again under my com
mand, went down May 3 and destroyed
them. Two on the north shore, one on
Corregldor Island, one on Cavallo Island
and the one spoken of above on Â£1 Fralla
rock.
Another thing: which strikes me a*
showing your correspondent rather drew
on his imagination for hla facts Is that
he says "Captain Coulson" assigned
Agulnaldo quarters on board her. This
must have been news to Captain Coulson.
and also to Captain ilodgeson of tha
revenue marine, who commanded the Mc-
Culloch at that time, and continued ta
do Â«o until Captain Hooper went out.
Now, so far as the article Intends to
laud the McCulloch and her officers and,
men for their conduct In that campaign.
I am with It heart and soul; tor In my
opinion, and I am sure in the opinion
of every other naval officer out there,
ho vessel could have possibly been more
alert, more attentive to duty or shown
more zeal, promptitude and efficiency than
did the McCulloch, whom we all learned
to respect and love. She waa always
ready, and, what's more, DID whatever
work was assigned her. and did It WELL,
And the fact that she was not In posi
tion to, and did not fire the first gun in
the Manila campaign in no way detracts
from her more than meritorious conduct
out there.

son and Calhoun were elected In 1523.
National nomination conventions had
been for several years under discussion,
having been proposed by different indi
viduals and newspapers opposed to the
Congressional caucus, but the difficulties*
in the way, together with the lack of.
agreement on the part of the people, had
prevented a general movement in favor of
the plan. Now some of the difficulties
began to disappear aa facilities for com
munication between the States Improved
with the improved roads and with trÂ»Â»
building of railways. State party con
ventions had gradually developed Import
ance and efficiency and the people werÂ»
familiar with their .working.
The First National Conventions.
In IS3O the first call for a national nom
inating convention (if we except a gath
ering of Federalists called in ISI2, which
proved nnimportnt and attracted little
attention) was sent out by. the anti-Ma
sons. Thirteen States were represented
in this first national convention. An ad-
criticism, because it had after all truly
represented the political sense of the peo
ple. It had nominated the real leaders of
the parties. But if it was to be able to
bring forward for election men whom tha
rank and file of the party did not n-I?h
for President, men whom they had not
thought of at all in that. connection, then
its usefulness would not only be in quts
tion.it would beat an end. The people tcolc
alarm and the newspapers voiced their
uneasiness. But the national satisfaction
over the successful termination of the
war and the unity of feeling which pre
vailed suspended active hostilities. Never
theless, when the chairman of the last Con
gressional caucus, by virtue of his office,
called a new one in ISSOthe call brought
together only about fifty members of tha
two houses, and they, in deference to the
general feeling, separated without taking
any action. The voting was by commo-i
consent for the re-election of Monroe anl
Tompkins, and no opposing candidates ap
peared.
The popular dissatisfaction with the
Congressional caucus was still gathering
force throughout the country. Even three
years before the canvass of 1524 the ritatea
began to anticipate the action of the party
representatives at Washington by them
selves recommending candidates for ths
Presidency. South Carolina was first In
the field. Tennessee came next, bringing
forward the name* of Andrew Jackaon,
and as many as twelve States made rum
inations before the meeting of the na
tional caucus. Nor was this all. Many uis
trict and county conventions were held
for the same purpoÃe: resolutions Â¦ -wera
passed, committees appointed and a strong
determination was manifested to super
Â«edo the* obnoxious machinery- Mass-meet
ings were held throughout the lan.l. Â«t
which regular ballots were taken to ratify
nominations made in some one of tneaÂ»
irregular ways, and every effort was maÂ«l-Â»
to discredit the system in vogue. News
papers and public meetings were made
very effective. Argument, ridicule, per
sonal influence, all were brought to bear.
The Legislature of Tennessee passed de
rogatory resolutions and asked the other
States to unite. to break down the power
of the irresponsible nominating body. A
Pennsylvania convention declared: ,If a
link In this chain of dynasties be not
broken now. then may we be fettere 1 by
it forever!" The dread oÂ£ the political
ring at Washington seems to have ben no
less lively than it is at the present day.
The friends of Henry Clay in that cltv
pledged themselves to attend no caucus.
NIW Register deplored the prevalence of
political intrigue, and contrasted the
chirpings of tomtit politicians with th 3
majestic voice of the people " which vctce
was asserted to be "decidedly against the
caucus."
The Second Disputed Election.
Once more and for the last time the
national Congressional '< caucus iwas held,
nevertheless. It met In February. 1821,
with only sixty-eight members present.
Called as it had been for the sole purpose
of giving to the friends of Crawford an
opportunity to manipulate more success
fully than before the nominating body,
it had neither power nor Influence and
did not even command respect. Crawford
as the caucus candidate received in the
electoral college but 41 of the 261 votes
cast The votes were divided among four
Presidential nominees â John Qunicy
Adams. William H. Crawford/Henry Clay
and Andrew Jacksonâ and, no choice hav
ing been made by the electors, the decision
again devolved upon the House of Repre
sentatives. Jackson was plainly the
popular choice, and had received a plur
ality of the electoral votes, but the bal
loting in the House by States (according
to the rules adopted in 1S01) gave thirteen
States to Adams, seven to Jackson and
four to Crawford. -while Clay, standing
fourth on the list of candidates, was in
eligible John C. Calhoun hart received
a large majority of the electoral votes for
Vice President.
The Conventions.
According to â¢ Professor Alexander
Johnston, it Is to Tammany Hall. that we
owe the first suggestion of a nominating
convention, and that so long ago as the
year 1813, when such an organ was pro
posed for nominating a Democratic can
didate for Governor of New York. Though
nothing came of it for that year, the Idea
was soon revived, and. ere long the nomi
nating convention became, as we shall
sÂ«ee, a prominent feature in â¢ State 'poli
tics throughout the Union.
The old Congressional caucus, as has
been shown, had come to an Inglorious
end in 1824, andu nothing had been agree/1
upon as a substitute. : It was felt that
for the next election unusual effort must
be = made -to secure -an expression of the
real sentiment of the jpeople. In 1525 the
State Legislature of Tennessee formally
nominated Andrew Jackson, for President
and during the three following years'in
numerable: State conventions, legislative
caucuses." county, district and town meet
ings of .various composition were held to
recommend I candidates for President - and
Vice President. The result was the re
nomination '; of - John Â¦ Qunicy Adams by
those 1 composing what Â¦ was beginning ; to
be - known as -the .> National .Republican
party, t and / the . nomination > of ' Andrew
Jackson < by ! the Democratic party. Jack-
dress to the people of the United State*
â¢was Issued and nominations for President
and Vice President were made. The con
vention idea was "in the air" and was
promptly adopted by the two great par
ties. The convention of the National Re
publicans, held in Baltimore in December,
IS3I. was called by a caucus of the mem
bers of that party in the Maryland Leg
islature. It l.s notable for the fact that
the opponents of the administration in
the' several States were invited to send
to it delegates equal in number to tha
Presidential electors to which their States
were entitled, while the suggestion was
made that the delegates be elected by
Congressional districts. This Is now the
almost universal method, though for some
time a variety of usage obtained, some
States choosing delegates In State con
ventions, others by legislative caucus,
others by district conventions. The pro
cedure of the Baltimore convention was in
many particulars much like that of a na
tional convention to-day. Eighteen States
and the District of Columbia sent dele
gates. There was the temporary organi
zation, the examination of credentials,
the permanent organization, the address

IL NATIONAL NOMINATING
MACHINERY.
-BY JESSE MACY, LL. D.
Decline of the Caucus.
The Congressional caucus had reacheu
the height of Its power and was novr to
hasten to Its downfall. By the events of
the year 1816 more than by anything that
had 'gone before the people were aroused
to a determined opposition to the system.
A nomination by the caucus had come 10
bej equivalent to an election, and In this
year the honor came near going to Wil
liam H. Crawford of Georgia, a man
whose name had never occurred to the
people as that of one fitted for the head of
the Government. Monroe received a ma
jority of only eleven votes In the caucus.
The caucus had held its place hitherto In
spite of abuses and in the face of adverse

EARNEST APPEAL
TO SUPERVISORS
BY A CLERGYMAN
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson
â¢ Is in Favor of Closing
Poolrooms.
Declares His ; Confidence in â¢ the Pass
age of ; the Anti-Granibling Ordi
: Â¦ nance and Predicts a ; New
Municipal Era. ';
i At the .Howard-street. Methodist Church
laet night, . the \ pastor. Rev. Dr. . John .'A.
B.f> Wilson, was bombarded with a: great
array of questions about the Cookes ; and
other themes . of Interest before his ser
mon,*; "On i Whose Side . Are You?" from
Matt. â¢'.xH:3oT-' I He: That Is Not With Me
Is; Against Me. 1 ' Â¦
Among' the 'questions propounded . were
the 'following: .' "What is your opinion of
the -;Tobln resolution*" against gambÃng
that is^to come up for final passage to
morrow, before the Supervisors? Should It
pass? Will it do any good if it does pass?"
The pastor, said: s ;; -.. .
In' reply .< to this I have to say I approve of
the resolution in every particular. It ought to
pass | unanimously and its enforcement is per
fectly, practicable. -It looks to me like the first
great practicable movement' on the part of the
Supervisors. to get at one difficulty. .San Fran
cisco stands gibbeted before the world as the
most shamelessly wide-open, immoral city. In
Christendom.' Men, .too dreadfully familiar with
the life of Paris and of London, tell me that It
is: immeasurably worse than either.. Personally
I do not know, for I -never go slumming, nor
allow myself to look upon misery I carinot re- i
lleve. With all its faults, I am glad to tie a
citizen of San Francisco. I believe In the in- i
tegrity of the Mayor and the Chief of Police,
and in their earnest purpose to faithfully exe
cute the . ordinances of the city and in their
desire for- the strongest measures from- the
Supervisors that shall comport with public
opinion.. Â¦Â¦Â¦ - . - .Â¦Â¦ â¢' . Â¦ .
Mr. Tobln's resolution is practicable. It can
,be enforced If passed, and If we are to have
something to amount to anything he has struck
what we need.. Everybody knows that the pool
room gambling, is'worse than that which goes
on upon the track. And every gambler knows
that every game is a dead game in San Fran
cisco.. I challenge 'any .gambler to. name one
square game in this city in any house or on
any track anywhere. Even the athletic sports
which are the least objectionable are so gen
erally fakes that no one can tell when one is
honest. Mr. Tobln's resolution deals with all
the scoundrellsms alike, putting all. under the
ban of law, and by so much raislnc a stand
ard of right and wrong that must tone up the
public conscience. ;
There is but one side to the question among
honest men.- Watch the board on the final
vote, for mark my word, not one man will vo/e
against it or seek to have it amended, who is
not bribed to do so. The votes against will be
either for cold cash or for future support of
the robber gang who hold up : the youth 'of
this city.- Indeed, the declaration has been
publicly made by one of the Supervisors who
spoke against it, not because It was wrong, un
wise or impracticable, .but because the sport
ing, fraternity constituted a large part of his
constituency, and it might lose his cause
their. support in the future. That is to say:
"Cutthroats, thieves and sure thing gamblers
elected me to. serve their Interests as against
the Interests of the city and society, and hav
ing been purchased by their votes for this pur
pose I must deliver the goods or lose their votes
In the future." I want to raj- that the gam
blers of this city themselves are ashamed of
such a. tool.
Mark what I say, the tactics of the old days
of a year ago will not be tolerated in this re
deemed city. The actions of other, days, . which
should have called out a reorganization of the
vigilance committee and a ro?e, will not now
be tolerated: But there is no danger: the pas
sage to a reading almost without debate, by a
vote 'of 12 to 5 does not mean defeat or emas
culation of this bill. Its passage will bring San
Francisco before the whole country, as -a city
that means to reform Its municipal life. Not
through making men good by law,- but by leg
islatively making it easy to do right and hard
to do wrong, so far as sure thing gambling lÂ«
concerned. And 1 predict that most if not all
6f the five Â¦will be found In line with the twelve
after giving, the question the â¢ sober second
thought for which the week has afforded them
an opportunity. v* / ;; ,-. 'Â¦â¢Â¦ ,-.â¢â¢â¢:-Â¦Â¦
Let the pulpit help the press when the latter
gets the load as now. and let the press help thÂ»
pulpit if the pulpit should get the start We
both want. and. we all want, not only a cleaner,
but a clean, city. And we want legislation that
.will .make vice 'unprofitable. ; I saw that re
sult achieved in New York. All vice was not
banished, but It was made so unprofitable as
to be reduced to the minimum. And It was *o
outlawed* that it ceased to be respectable to
be a scoundrel: and thousands of the bad ele
ment carried their : trade to other cities, and
many reformed... Â¦ â¢ . ' :v: ..'v. r >
RESPONSIBILITIES OF
OFFICIALS DISCUSSED
Rev. E. A. Woods of the First Baptist
Church last night delivered a strong; ills
course, on the â¢'Respdnsibllities' of. Office
holders"; as a prelude to his regular ser-:
mon. In part -he said:.- --
Those , who 'accept . public office -receive- a
sacred trust and assume special responsibili
ties - By their oath of office they are sworn to
act, for the public's good. For wickedness which
tfcey "ould- prevent, â¢ but do not. they are to a
degree I responsible. \ They are none the less
KUilty because others are, sharers in this neglect
of duty. To seeithe poor, "ignorant children
neeced or -misled .by" deslcnlnK men and not
strivÂ« to protect them is to. share in the guilt
of their ruin. Td protect the health and morals
cf the peopl* â¢Is â¢ a duty of our city officials,
and Â¦no personal or party reasons can excuse
the.neelect of such duty. Indeed, every â¢ irood
citizen, whether In public or prlrate life, should
feel that his responsibility for the. public wel
fare Is limited only by -his Influence.. . ' ' I.:.
Pilate cannot Trash his hands and be Inno
cent- when .he has .the, power to prevent the
crucifixion. Men 1 are resoonslble for the evils
they could "prevent." He who excused himself
by saying "Am I my brother's keeper?' after

Fun at the Chutes and â¢

The arrest of a lone driver of an auto
mobile was the only excitement furnished
the people at the park yesterday. E. A.
Boesete, either through Ignorance of the
existence of a prohibitory ordinance or
through a 'determination to place himself
In the hands of the officers, that he might
contest the constitutionality of the act of
the Park Commissioners, sent his auto
mobile gteamlng through the drives of the
pleasure" grounds until overhauled by Offi
cer N. R. Norton, who placed him under
arrest. Boesete and his automobile were
taken to the Stanyan-street Police station,
and on depositing $10 ball the prisoner was
released, and mounting his automobile
wended his way to -town.
The threatening weather of the early
afternoon kept many people In their
homes who would otherwise have visited
one or the other of the various resorts.
When the sun came out later in the day,
however, the crowds Increased, but an
other change In the weather drove them
home again. The usual jolly crowd gath
ered at the Chutes,- and another was at
Sutro Baths. There were no accidents
or Incidents worthy of mention at either
place., and all enjoyed the outing. Follow

The steamer .Walla Walla arrived from
Puget Sound yesterday. Among the cabin
passengers was Peter Jackson, who has
once more returned to San Francisco.
"Poor old Peter" looks financially - all
right, but phyeically he is a wreck. His
chest has fallen in. his cheeks are sunken
and his eyes have lost their brightness.
He has acquired the slow walk of an old
man and altogether ha* aged a great
deal since he left here. Peter was dress

wore a big ulster, even though it was 70
in the shade. He has no particular object

Final Championship Bound Between
Folger and Hubbard Ends
in a Tie.
The tournament for the championship
of the Oakland and San Francisco Golf
clubs has not yet reached a conclusion,
though the final round over thirty-six
holes between E. R. Folger and C. P.
Hubbard was played yesterday on the
Oakland links. On Saturday E. R. Folger
defeated F. R. Stratton in the semi-final
round and so won his way into the final
round against C P. Hubbard, .who had
defeated his antagonist, P. E. Bowles Jr.
Hubbard and Folger yesterday played a
notable game, being all even at the end
of the first eighteen holes. After the
thirty-fourth hole had been played it
looked like Hubbard's match, for he was
2 up, but Folger won the next two holes
and mado it all square. The tie will be
played off next Sunday .over eighteen
holes.
May had been taken out of the lagoon
about a fortnight ago and the Corinthian
yachts Speedwell, Harpoon, Emilie, Arc
turus. Naiad and Nereid lay throughout
the winter at their moorings in the cove.
The following yachts were towed out yes
terday: Lois, Claire. Klia, Rover, Merope,
Presto, Wawona, Diana, Paul, Lapwing,
Thelma, Emma, Queen, Thetis, Freda,
Truant, Amigo, Mlgnon, Halcyon, Phoen
icia, Cupid, Ceres, Neptune, Seven Bells,
Spray and Wave.
After the yachts the arks La Fiesta and
La Boheme came out, but the rest of the
arks will remain in the<lagoon for three'
or four weeks longer. No mishap befell
any yacht except the yawl Seven Bells,
which struck the bridge and broke her
topmast, causing all the rigging to fall
on deck, fortunately, however, without in
juring any one. Robert Tittel's launch
Crescie and Hugo Keil's small launch did
yeoman service in towing the yachts out
and Bowers' Gypsy was also made useful.
James Kitterman's launch America
towed the following yachts over to Sausa
llto: Sloops Rover, Thetis. Twiliiht and
Juanita and the schooner Outing.
Some delay -was experienced in raising
the bridge, owing to the fact that John
Xorby, the boatkeeper of the Corinthian
Yacht Club, was severely injured by a
man named Rice and is under medical at
tendance. The two men were playing
cards in Tiburon, and a dispute arising
over a small sum of money. Rice drew a
Eenknife and slashed Norby In the groin,
everal of the yacht-owners who had ar
ranged with Norby to prepare their craft
for the coming season will be delayed in
putting them in commission as they will
have to get the work done by others.
CURTIS' FLYING FOX DEFEATS
LUXOR IN THE CHAMPION STAKE
Eugene Geary's Ireland Wins
the St. Patrick's Day
Stake.
LI'XOR, pronounced by many cours
ing men the fastest greyhound in
America, was defeated yesterday at
Union Coursing Park by Flying Fox,
his kennel-mate, in the great cham
pion stake. Eugene Geary's Ireland,
which teems appropriately named, won
the St. Patrick's day stake. He is only
eeventeen months old and showed his re
markable class by winning this 126-dog
stake after the severest competition.
The coursing throughout the day was bril
liant. The best dogs on the coast met in
round after round and the hares proved
sufficiently strong to test the greyhounds
to the utmost.
The defeat of Luxor was the great sur
prise of the day. He had been a pro
nounced favorite all day and when he
met Flying Fox in the final he sold for 8
to 1. He led to the hare by two lengths
and scored the first turn. He placed his
opponent for three turns and then scored
again himself. Flying Fox securing an
other turn, making the score 4 to 4. Luxor
â¢scored one more turn, when Flying fox
went around on the outside and killed,
making the score 6 to 6 in his favor. He
had one more course than the runner-up,
as he ran an undecided course with
Whltehead in the second round. He also
defeated Mac's Melody and Spiteful.
The latter showed well for his first ap
pearance in competition here. He beat
Metallic, "who was not In condition, how
ever, and also defeated Theron in the
longest couree of the day, the score being
In the open stake Ireland, the winner,
Â¦was never In danger until he met Mc-
Ktnley, Curtis & Son's iron dog. in the
lir.al. The latter won the midweek stake
last Wednesday, but showed no bad ef
fects from his exertions. Ireland led him
two lengths to the hare. Ireland beat
Blackette. Uncle Fuller. Royal Anne,
Cash, which he led three lengths, and.
finally. McKJnlcy. He is by Emm Pasha-

of a spare piece of lumber, which Cap
tain Eagles considers a work of art. Dur
ing the live days of enforced detention in

and when the vessel docked at the sugar
refinery yesterday, the score was: Chick
ering 172 games won, 171 <garaes lost;
Swanson 171 gamps won. 172 games lost.
The opinion of both gentlemen is that if
they had continued to play for a year the
ratio would be the same. Mr. Chickering
would rather play crib ashore than in
quarantine within sight of home, how
ever, even though the company was thor
oughly to his liking.
The ship's crew will probably he paid
off before the United States Shipping
Commissioner to-day, but the chances are
that Mr. Chickering will not appear to de
mand his 25 cents. He says the counting
of 1, 2. 3, 4âlo, tally, as the bags went
into the ship's hold, was good mental
exercise, and that, therefore, he is entitled
to no remuneration.
did not go ashore, but fearing detention
at the hands of Dr. Kinyoun on his re
turn to San Francisco he shipped as
"purser" at the munificent salary of 25
cents a month.
Captain Eagles, of course, looked upon
the arrangement as a matter of form, but
Purser Chickering would not have it that
way. He tallied the entire cargo of su
gar, amounting to 27,800 baps, made out
the manifest and ship's papers and did
all the other work that usually devolves
upon the ship's paymaster.
Mr. Chickering's self-sacrifice did not
avail, however, as the Centennial was
held five days in quarantine upon her ar
rival here. Still, time did not hang so
heavy .on his hands after Captain Alec
Swanson boarded the steamer from the
pilot boat Bonita. Mr. Chickering is very
fond of a game of "crib," and Captain
Swanson is an expert at the game. There
was no crib board, but Alec soon over
came that difficulty. He made a board out

When the Centennial left here on Jan

It appears that when the Centennial

STANFORD DEFEATS
SANTA CLARA NINE
An Exciting Game of Baseball Won
by the University Team at
San Jose.
SAX JOSE, March 18.â The frame at
Cyclers' Park yesterday between Stanford
and Santa Clara College baseball teams
was an Interesting, affair and resulted In
a victory for Stanford, after nine Innings
of stubborn contest. Neither side had any
advantage up to the last, the result of the
game being always in doubt. Stanford
was fortunate in getting hits at the right
time, and though some of them were not
clean, yet they resulted disastrously for
Santa Clara. The fourth Inning was the un
lucky inning for Santa Clara, when, with
two men out and two on bases, Hampson
of Stanford drove a long fly to left field.
The ball was lost in the high grass and
three men scored. Santa Clara played a
good uphill game, however, and managed
to score two runs in the sixth inning,
making the score five to four in favor of
Stanford. In the following inning the
score was tied, only to be untied again by
fevrohn who, with tÂ»'Â« out, brought In
Lougheed and Kdwards with a two-bag
ger. Santa Clara secured another run in
the eighth* Inning-, but could get nothing
in the ninth. The game ended with the
score seven to six in favor of Stanford.
The battery work of both teams was good
and the fielding of Ryan was worthy of
mention.

I The fabulously rich gold field extending
from Cape Yorke to Cape Nome Is attract
ing the attention of the civilized world.
Men from all corners of the' earth are
awaiting the breaking up of the ice in
the spring in order to get there. Rumors
of "rich strikes" and "new diggings" have
reached here during the winter and in
consequence everybody is more than anx
ious to be among the first to reach the
new jEI Dorado.
The brig Pitcalrn left here on the 12th
Jr.st. with about thirty passeagers. all
bqund for Nome. It is CapViin JNesbitts
intention to make for "PnnV "of Wales
Island and remain there until Bering
Strait is clear of ice. He will then
cross over and if no -passage can pc
found ho will land his passengers on .the
shore ico and allow them to make their
way landward in sleds.
The greatest interest centers ln_ the
steam whaling fleet, however. inese
vessels are not carrying passengers, but
each owner is sending a vessel away with
one or two representatives, whose objec
tive point is Nome. Nearly every whaler
that came home from the frozen North
brought more or less news gathered from
the Indians while trading and the rep
resentatives" are going north to test the
truth or falsity of these reports.
On the 10th inst. William Lewis sent out
the steam whaler William Baylies. She
cleared for a whaling cruise, but will
probably drop In at Nome when the ice
opens. On Wednesday next the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company will send out
the Mary D. Hume and Roth, Blum &
Co. will dispatch the JeaneUe. Both
these vessels will go to Puget Sound first
of all and after that will make a deter
mined effort to be first to the gold fields.
Albert L.. Blum will go north in the Jean
ette and Cal Dickey and two others will
be passengers on the Mary D. Hume.
A company of ten, just as anxious as
the whalers to reach Cape Nome, offered
Captain Newth of the Jeanette $500 each
to take them along, but he refused. The
Mary D. Hume has been transformed
from a whaler into a tugboat and she has
now only limited .passenger accommoda
tions. In consequence the ten men had
to seek transportation on another vessel.
The whaling bark Alaska is to sail short
ly for Cape Yorke and Nome and Captain
Cogan expects to reach there as soon as
the steamers do. His vessel is fitted to
carry passengers, so the chances are that
the gold-hunters will go on her.
It will be a battle royal between the
Jeanette and the Mary D. Hume, how
ever, with the betting in favor of the
former. Neither captain is very anxious
to pet very far north this month, so
neither vessel will be rushed. As soon as
the ice begins to open the real work will
begin. As soon as the Jeanette lands
Mr. Blum at Cape Nome she will proceed
on her whaling cruise. The Mary D.
Hume will remain on the ground, how
ever, and go into the towing business.
The Government has chartered the
steamer Grace Barton from the PipCr-
Aden-Goodall Company to take the place
of the McDowell on the run betwen the
army posts. The latter vessel will be laid
up for about/ two months for an over
hauling.

BISHOP POTTER HOPES
FOR CHURCH EXTENSION
Fully Explains His Recent Visit to
Honolulu and the Philippine
Islands.
NEW YORK, March IS.-Blshop Henry
C. Potter formally announced at -- the
morning service in Grace Church to-day
that the object of his recent Journey to
Honolulu and the Philippine Islands was
to extend the Influence of the Protestant
Episcopal church In the new possessions
of tho United States Government. He
"My trip to Honolulu and the Philip
pines had for its object the extension of
the influence of the Protestant Episcopal
church in those islands. My observations
convince me that the Protestant Epis
copal church should be extended in both
Hawaii and the Philippines and it is now
the clear duty of the English-speaking
pe,ople to see that the. Christian religion
is firmly established among the Inhabi
tants on those islands."
During his sermon the Bishop took oc
casion to give an unqualified indorsement
to the policy of President McKinley in
the East, especially praising him for send
ing a ship of war to Taku, China, for the
purpose of protecting the American mis
sionaries in the province of Shantung,
whose lives are threatened by the "Box

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B.C., March 18.â The steam
er Tees, just in from Skaguay reports that
a ; letter reached there from Walter
Church, a well-known mining man, dated
OAKLAND, March 18.â Three burglars
were surprised by W. H. Price Jr.
at his residence, 41 "Wayne avenue,
Peralta Heights, this evening. He
had a running fight with the trio
and captured one of them after
knocking him into insensibility with a
heavy stove poker. The captured thief
was turned over to the police. He gave
the name of Thomas Patterson and said
he was IS years old. a printer and recently
from Arizona. The dectectlves had good
descriptions of the two burglars who es
caped, and the entire police force was put
on watch for them. Pbtterson was so
badly disabled after his battle with Price
that he was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital to have several wounds on his head
dressed before he was taken to the City
Prison. Price escaped without injury, -al
though he was confronted by a brace of
pistols in the hands of the two burglars
who got away. The only weapon the
plucky householder could seize In time to
make his struggle to hold the intruders
was a poker, which he grabbed hurriedly
after the surprised burglars broke for lhe
street.
The residence is occupied by Mr. Price,
who is a clerk employed by W. P. Fuller
& Co. of this city, and his father and
mother. Mrs. Price Is away at a health
resort and her husband and son have only
been occupying the residence at.nignt.
About 7 o'clock this evening the young:
man was returning home alone. None of
the family had been there during the day.
As he neared the house he heard noises
upstairs, and stepping inside called,
thinking some relatives were there. Re
ceiving no response he went immediately
upstairs to a rear bedroom, from whence
the sounds issued, and on trying the door
he found It locked. His suspicions- were
aroused, and peering through the keyhole
he saw three men in the room. . Thinking
that they would rush downstairs as soon
as they realized they were dlscoverfU,
Price ran ahead and waited for the bur
glars, who quickly followed him. As they
dashed through the house two of the
housebreakers flashed pistol, and then
the fighting began. With his stove poker
Price set after the thieves, who made
their way out of the front door. The tiio
separated and their pursuer ran for tne
man he finally landed.
"I didn't have time to prepare for a
fight," said the young man, "but I
grabbed the poker and started after the
crowd as hard as I could. The man near
est me could not outrun me, and I finally
landed him with a hard blow on the head.
We were a couple of blocks from the
house when he gave up. I got him back
to the house and kept guard over him
while neighbors called the police.", .
Price deprecated the idea of bravery.
"I was too mad when I saw those men
in the house to do anything else but go

MARION AGAIN GOES
ON A PAY CRUISE
Target Practice Off Bed Bock, a Sa-
lute to the Yacht Clubs and a
Man Overboard.
The Marlon was once more astir yester
2ay, and this time she went as far north
bs Red Rock, then back and through Rac
coon Straits and home again to her an
chcrage off Folsom-street dock. She waj
manned by a crew of enthusiasts largo
enough to do the work and keep out of
each other's way, and her trip was punc
tuated by several incidents of importance
from the standpoint of the naval reserve
man.
The anchor came up clear. This was in
marked contrast to the hook which was
raised last time the vessel cruised, for
that, was as foul an anchor as any one
would wish to see. There was no time
waited over the start, therefore, and the
phip headed up the bay for Red Rock. The
jibtopsail and main trysail had been bent
during the morning, more, however, as a
bit of exorcise for the crc-w Dan for use,
for they were not set during the day. She
went along under spanker and jib as be
tore. with the assistance of her antiquated
tr.pines.
Off Red Rock the after gruns were cast
loose for target practice, but there was
nut time for more than a shot or two and
then the s=hip headed down the bay again
end through Raccoon Straits. Off the
yacht clubs at Belvedere she fired some
blanks, just to let people know she had
t'omething besides sails aboard, and then
ehÂ« returned to her anchorge. Before
coming to her berth again she pet her
number in true man-o'-war style, and she
would have signaled for permission to
anchor if there had been a ship there
senior to her and capable of granting the
request, for warships are not supposed to
anchor in company of seniors without
asking permission.
There was some small excitement when
the Marion was anchored, caused by the
sudden bath of Seaman Hanson of the
Flr*t Division. He was in the first cutter,
hanging at the davits and. with others,
was busy casting her loose and getting
her ready for lowering when he got too
far to one side. She tipped and he fell
into the water, a distance of fifteen or
pixteen feet- When he went over he had
hold of a boathook. and when he rose to
the surface he still had the boathook in
his hand, and he at once hooked himself
into a ringbolt in the ship's side and hung
on. Master at Arms Blythe had gone
down the side after him like a monkey,
and he was ready to give him a hand back
to the ship. The launch of the Logan,
xvhich lies Just beyond the Marion, was
passing at the time and she came to the
rescue, while the lifeboat at the stern
was being dropped. There was no occa
pion for trouble, however, for the luck
less Hanson was towed to the gangway
end came over the side bringing a good
part of the bay with him.
The surpeons in the sick bay gave him
Fomething to keep away chilis. A day on
the Marion durinc a cruise counts as to
drills, so there will not be much doing on
the old ship for two weeks. Then the
friends of the reserve will be made wel
come on board, and then in another week.
or at most two weeks, she will pick her
anchor up again and once more she will
go cutting capers around the bay.
There was no trouble yesterday with
any of the gear. The men. profiting by
thÂ« last exrÂ»erience. knew what to do
â¢when quarters were ordered, and it will
not be lonff before the old ship with her
amateur crew will weigh and get under
way and come to anchor again as pret

BENJAMIN FAY MILLS
SPEAKS ON EVOLUTION
Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills last night de
livered in Metropolitan Temple the first
of a series of Sunday ethical lectures un
der the auspices of the Sunday Lecture
Association.
The title of Rev. Mr. Mills' address was,
"The Germs of a Greater Religion." The
lecture was practically a dissertation and
indorsement of the theory of evolution,
and was listened to with great attention
by an audience that taxed the seating ca
pacity of the temple.
The speaker began by saying he did not
wish any one to think that he was speak
ing of religion in Us narrow sense. By
that he meant that he was no believer In
sect.
"There is," said he, "no such thing as
this religion and that religion. There is
but one religion, as there Is but one ocean.
But there are epochs of religion, as there
have been epochs of scientific thought."
He then went on to say that a new idea
had been received; a new term given to
religion; a fulcrum offered humanity on
which humanity might plant its levers and
raise the world. That term, that fulcrum,
the speaker said, was evolution.

SLAPS AN USHER IN
ST. IGNATIUS CHURCH
Miss Eliza Neuman Acts Queerly
During Mass and Is Removed
by the Police.
Devotions of the congregation at the 9:3Q
mass at St. Ignatius Church yesterday
morning were badly interrupted by the pe
culiar actions of Miss Eliza Neuman, re
siding at C5O GroVe street. The young lady
began acting queerly in the early part of
the service, standing up in the pew she oc
cupied, removing her hat and throwing it
up the aisle.
One of the ushers of tho church polite
ly requested her to withdraw, but she de
clined to do so. On his repeating the sug
gestion she slapped him in the face. She
was then forcibly removed and turned
over to the police. She was placed in a
padded cell at the Receiving Hospital and
her step-brother, Charles Kiernan, was
notified of her condition.
Mr. Kiernan said Miss Xeuraan was of
unsound mind and had been so for sev
eral years. He will, on behalf of the
family, request that she be confined In an
asylum, as she becomes violent at times.
OnJy recently she struck her aged mother,
Mrs. Ellen Kiernan, a violent blow on the
head. The young lady Is a talented
musician, being an export on the violin
and is also a fine vocalist.

A WORD FOR THE BOER
FROM A LOCAL PULPIT
Rev. 11. F. Shepard preached yesterday
in the Olivet Congregational Church on
the Boer war. In part he said:
Our recent conflict with Spain and the con
flict of the Boers with England are events of
national destiny In behalf of republican liberty.
My position in reference to the Philippines is
too well known to need reiteration, and I bei?
leave to differ from an apparently English dally
of this city and to find no inconsistency In the
view of friends of the present administration of
the United States who are likewise friends of
the Boers.
England's fame would be far fairer In the
wcrld to-day if she would honestly own that
under the Influence of a false capitalist and of
a suborned prime minister her policy is that
mipht gives right; and silence of her subjects
becomes connivance and partnership In crime.
Boasted motives of equality and of civiliza
tion needed no war; and progress and edu
cation could have won wisely and well In
peace. The Boers are rt-W and Britain Is
wrong. Sophistry of selfishness and subterfuge
of conquest cannot hide this fact.
The physical health of the Boer Is proof of
his moral livine. Marksmen that have no
equals are not degenerates. A simple pastoral
life that is innocent of urban sin shames
the traducer that calls the Boer low and vile.
The Boers may be helped in America if no
stone Is left unturned to create truthful senti
ment. English/writers are doing their best to
shape our opinion in Britain's behalf. We ad
mit the ties that bind us to England, but no
bond that is sealed by Injustice and falsehood
is worth Its coÂ«t. American lntelllsence does
not IJfelieve England should win. England has
no divine commission Â»o civilize the world by
the "dum-dum" and the "lon sr Tom." England
may win, but the Modder River is better for the
Boers than moral defeat. Right is Invincible.
England Is doomed to be her own Xemesls If
her policy Is not changed.
The time Is opportune for International heart
searching^. Our own escutcheon Is marred and
stained; witneFS the Indian, the negro and the
Spanish pioneer of California. Force has acci
dental value in struggling for freedom, and
with prayer for success of the Boer arms, we
join petition for Britain's awakening to reason
and to love. Humanity's victories In love are
final.
BURR McINTOSH
AS PUDD'NHEAD
THE performance of "Pudd'nhead
Wilson" at the California last night
was a treat. The play is old, but It
Is as Interest.ne as it was when
new; it is not great, but It comes no
ticeably near being so. As a dramatic
entertainment it Is agreeable, enjoyaoie,
admirable. Its yester atmosphere and
p.w^uresqueness are charming qualities
and yet It must be granted they would
not alone make it as fascinating as It is
without the conslstantly artistic treat
ment that it is given by the clever com
pany.
This company came to us quite unher
alded, but it turns out to be one of uni
form excellence with here and there an
accent, a touch of unusual merit that adds
greatly to the enjoyment of the perform
ance. Mr. Burr Mclntosh made his first
appearance here in the part of Pudd'n
head and in a quiet way made an impres
sion that took hold of the audience in the
first act and sank in with each act that
followed. * -
His ability has been a matter of accept
ance in the East amounting at least to a
"reputation," If not exactly to fame, and
some interest attaches to his personality
by reason of his achievements as an ath
lete, a student, a war correspondent and
what not. .
As an actor he is certainly to be reck
oned with, for, although he has been
playing Pudd'nhead but far a short time,
he has a grasp on the subtleties of the
part that is quite remarkable. His char
acterization is almost thorough and prom
ises much to come with use.
His reserve is admirable, unaffected,
genuine, and results in an effectiverosj
that carries conviction with it and com
passes the spell that betrays the real actor
and the true artist. There is something ii>
the Herculean physique of Mr. Mclntoah
that hints at nerolc possibilities, and al
though his picture of the simple soul of
Puda'nhead defies penetration to the man
beneath, yet one instinctively feels that
there is force and versatility under thu
disguise. .
Miss Nina Morris gives .an interesting
and vital picture of Roxy, acting with
discretion and effect. The. part of Tom
Driscoll as taken by Frank Campeau haa
all the necessary nastiness, though he la
perhaps too much the modern "mucker '
and there is the air of the cheap red melo
drama in his impersonation.
Opposite the repellant character of Tom
Driscoll, Manifee Johnstone acts Cham
bers strongly and well. Edwin Nalod has
poise as the Southern magistrate, and
Macey Harlam in a small part seem 3 to
be a clever actor. The Rowey of Miss
Mayo is prettily treated, and a long ilst of
small parts are more than acceptably
done. PORTER GARNETT.

NEW YORK. March 19.â The Sun has
the following from Rome: The Pope has
telegraphed congratulations to the Queen
on her decision to visit Ireland, and ex
pressing the hope that discord may De for

ACTION DELAYED ON
LEX HEINZE BILL
Much Adverse Comment on the Pecu
liar Actions of Count Posa
dowski-Wehner,
BERLIN. March IS.â The so-called "Lex
Heinze," whose third reading was not fin
ished last evening, will not be taken up
until the Reichstag majority has changed
the rules of procedure requiring the fifty
members who move any resolutions to re
main in the house during the vote upon
it, thus rendering impossible the sort of
obstruction that was practiced, last week.
The Easter adjournment will come with
the beginning of April. The Pope's wish,
expressed to the Centrist leaders, that
they should vote for the naval augmenta
tion bill, has not had the expected result.
The miscarriage thus far of the Govern
ment's meat inspection bill, is delaying
the third reading until after Easter. Tho
Government meanwhile hopes to effect a
compromise. Â¦' '"til"'
The situation Is largely due to . the
treacherous activity of Count Posadow
ski-Wehner. Against Prince yon Hohen
lohe's definite instructions and also
against a previous agreement Into which
all the members of the cabinet entered,
Count Posadowski-Wehner raised false
hopes among the Agrarians and pledged
them his word that the extreme form of
the bill, as the second reading fixed it,
would be acceptable to the Bundesrath.
Consequently the Agrarians feel that
they have been unfairly treated and the
relations between Prince yon Hohenlohe
and the Count are very much strained.
Possibly Baron yon Thielmann. who is
thoroughly in accord with the Chancellor,
will soon succeed the Imperial Secretary
of State for the Interior.
To-day's papers vigorously comment
upon yesterday's proceedings in the
Reichstag, which, for vituperation, noise
and unscrupulous obstruction, are without
parallel in the history of that body. The
fact is also criticized that the Chancellor's
son Prince Alexander, spoke in vigorous
condemnation of the entire "Lex Heinze,"
as proposed by the Government.
WHY OTIS FAILED TO
MENTION WHEELER
War Department Omcial Explains
the Seeming Injustice to the
General.
.DALLAS. Tex., March 18.â M. B. Davis,
who served with General Wheeler In the
Confederate army, recently wrote to the
War Department concerning /the reports
that General Otis had intentionally Ig
nored mentioning General Wheeler in his
reports concerning the fighting in the
Philippines. Mr. Davis to-day received
a long reply from John A. Johnston, as
sistant adjutant general, In which ,he
says:
"It has not been usual for General Otis
to cable to this department the particular
service of individual officers unless they
were operating independently. General
Wheeler's brigade was attached to Gen
eral Mac Arthur's division. General Mac-
Arthur was the commander, and all oper
ations in which this brigade participated,
so far as the department has been ad
vised, were personally conducted by Gen
eral Mac Arthur."
The letter then names engagements In
four campaigns from September 9 to No
vember 11, in which General Wheeler's
brigade was In action, and concludes:
"Xo official reports of these engage
ments in which the special performance
of brigade commanders are likely to have
been mentioned have as yet been received
at this department."

which led me to try my best to capture
at least one of them. The others were
too fast, and I didn't stand much chance
with them. They were in too strong
force. I thought by getting downstairs
I would be in better position to give
battle. They had. locked themselves in
the bedroom, and as I didn't have a pis
tol there wasn't much opportunity there
to land them." * - -
When the burglars hastened downstairs
Price was ready to: meet them, but the
sudden display of .pistols disconcerted
him for a second. The three piled over
him to get out, and succeeded in reaching
the street after their attack in force. The
two men who escaped ran away together,
so Price singled out their lone compan
ion. Patterson admitted to the police he
had been in the house and that he had
been knocked out by Price's poker.
After the excitement was over Price
found his visitors had ransacked the
house thoroughly, had packed a lot of
valuables, and from appearances were
preparing to leave with their plunder
when he surprised them. They had pulled
beds to pieces, gone into bureau drawers
and upset every article of furniture
which might have been the hiding place
of jewelry, money or other valuables. In
the hasty examination made this evening
no property seemed to be missing. The
family will look more closely to-morrow.
The detectives are satisfied the burglars
knew what they were doing and were
familiar with the habits of the occupants
of the dwelling.

BERKELEY AT
THE MERCY OF
THE RAILROAD
People Struggling to Have
the City Properly Rec
ognized.
BERKELEY, March IS.â The people of
two sections of Berkeley are struggling
against two railroad injustices. At South
Berkeley the residents and merchants arÂ»
trying to have the gates on the east sido
of the local trains opened and at West
Berkeley the residents and merchants ara
trying to have some of the main Una
trains stop for the receipt and dischargo
of passengers. Â»
The residents of South Berkeley, par
ticularly those who travel back and forth
on the local trains, will begin the circula
tion of a petition to the Southern Pacific
Company this week making the request
that one set of gates on the east side of
the local trains be opened at stations.
The residents of this section have appeal
ed to the Board of Trustees, who offi
cially communicated with the railroad,
but without success. Now the residents
are going to take the matter in their own
hands and will deal directly with the rail
road company.

Large Deal in Trinity Countyâ Gravel Devel

Bring Fortunes to Speculators.
mINING men will be interested in
the terms of a bill which has
been Introduced in the Senate of
the United States by Chaumsey
M. Depew for the promotion of mining,
mineral and metallurgical sciences in this
country. The measure has been referred
to the Committee on Mines and Mining.
It starts with a i preamble setting forth
that as the products of the mining and
mineral industry last year contributed the
enormous sum of $1,000,000,000 to the wealth
of the country, rivaling the product of
agriculture, and as the general Interests
of agriculture are fostered by Government
aid through the provisions of the Hatch
and Morrill acts to the extent of $10,000 per
annum to each State afT& Territory, there
fore it appears but just and proper that
the general Government should endow
and support in a similar manner the in
terests of the mining, metallic and metal
lurgical sciences of the country. One sec
tion provides that for the year ending
June 30, 1900, there shall be appropriated
to each State and Territory from moneys
derived from the sale of the public lands
and not otherwise appropriated the sum
;of $13,u00, this appropriation to be . in
creased and made annual at the rate or
an additional JlwO-per annum until the
end of ten years, when the amount to each
State and Territory will be *,25,0w). lhat
will be the amount thereafter annually
appropriated "for the endowment of and
: maintenance of the department of mines
and mining in all State or Territorial
schools or colleges now established or
which may hereafter be established.
! What the schools are to do in return for
I this assistance is set forth as follows:
It shall be the object and duty of said
Bchools or colleges of mines receiving the
bpiiedt of said fund to .conduct original
i*!>earch or veriry experiments on the min
eral bearing rocks or deposits of the various
economical metals of the several States
an.l Territories: to investigate the build
ing stones, mineral fuels, clays and all
mineral deposits "of whatsoever nature that
may exist in any of the States or Terri
tories; to experiment on processes of min
ing, ventilation, milling and the effective
ness and economy of mining machinery,,
and the various processes of ore treatment
and metallurgy, to give instructions in
assaying, methods of analysis, metallurgy,
mineralogy, petrology, geology and kindred
sciences, which have a bearing on work
necessary to an Intelligent mining and
metallurgical education. It shall bÂ» the
duty of the governing boards of the school
of mines, with the advice of the president
or director, to Indicate and outline, from
time to time, special lines of work to b*
carried on, as the nature of the mineral
products . of such State or Territory may
suggest as being a fruitful field for profit
able research.
Oil discoveries have been made in gold
placer ground in Mohave County, Arizona.
This Is in the Chemehuevis district. The
oil sand is reported to be found any where
in a strip of four miles wide and extend
ing from the banks of the Colorado River
to the Chemehuevi3 range of mountains.
There is a rush into the territory from
Northern Arizona. Speculators from
Kingman and other places have laiid in
the supposed belt. The oil sand is re
ported to be very "greasy."
Negotiations are pending at Salt Lake
for the consolidation of Captain de la
Mar's mines with those of the Mercur
Mining: Company. President Dern of the
Mercur Company has gone to Paris, where
he will meet Captain de la Mar and com
plete the details of consolidation. The
union of the properties has been under
discussion many, months. Captain de la
Mar opened up the negotiations nnd found
the directors of the Mercur Company
ready to meet him half -way. The consol
idated company will start with a capital
of $10,000,000, according to the story that is
sent in from Salt I>ake.
The Paulssen properties in Trinity
County and on the Trinity River have
been purchased by the Philadelphia capi
talists who compose the Last Chance Min
ing Company: also the Union Hill mine,
near* Douglass City, and one-half of the
interest in^ the Dutton. Creek properties,
southwest of Weavervllle. The deal takes
in about 1670 acres of land and ditches
and water rights on Grass Valley Creek.
The price was $125,000, all but $10,000 to be
paid from the profits.. but with the pro
viso that the last payment shall be made
not later than September, 1903. Next
month 100 men will be put to work.
Here is a piece of information from the
Mining Press that is useful. To deter
mine whether a given low grade gold or
silver ore can be profitably concentrated
take a weighed quantity of dry pulverized
ore passed through a 40-mesh screen,
such as will be the average sample of
the bulk of ore treated, say one pound,
after having previously assayed the sam
ple. Pan this quantitly carefully into a
second pan and repan until all the sul
phurets are separated from the gangue:
then dry and weigh the sulphurets and
assay, them. The weight represents the
percentage of sulphurets the ore contains.
A sulphuret, in the old nomenclature, was
a compound of sulphur with a radical ele
ment. -In the latest nomenclature it has
been superseded by the term sulphide,
but is used to designate certain native
undecomposed metallic sulphides, as /fold
bearing pyrites. A sulphate Is a salt of
sulphuric acid.
The Boston and South. Dakota Mining
Company is extensively opening up the
Turkey Hill gravel mine, near Michigan
Bluff. The main tunnel, which has been
driven in 4400 feet in former workings, has
been extended 350 feet* and has encoun
tered blue gravel. The gravel is 2a feet
above the tunnel level. Crosscuts 1 and 2
have been started. The channel Is about
1000 feet in width. The company has pur
chased the Dead Horse ditch and will
soon install an electric plant.
The expectation is entertained that the
Union copper mine. In Calaveraa County.
will 1 be clear of water sbon. All the old
ironwork will be taken out and. as it is
coated with copper, it will be saved for
the copper. It is not settled whether the
old shaft will be used or a new one put
down. By the old shaft and incline it is
1000 feet, and by putting in a new shaft
about 400 feet ran be saved.
A. W Warwick, who has been writing
a series of articles on the subject of ore
dressing, sums up his conclusions prac
tically as follows: Gradual reduction of
ore to the desired size will be a feature
of the medern mill. In the newer mills
the cii-shtiiK department will be regarded
as distinct 'a division as the engine room
itself. Mere capacity of the crushing
plant " and a low cost of handling will
not be the ruling ideas. A well crushed
product will" render the after operations
simpler, cheaper and more efficacious. If
a secondary crushing plant is necessary
the interesting question arises whether it
would not be the best policy to crush the
whole of the rock more coarsely and
thus make more' of the middlings. The
advantages of this scheme are two: At
one operation the large amount of barren
material is removed; also the cost of
crushing Would not be so great.
In July 18S6. the Lost Confidence mine
in Shasta County was bought for $125,000
by San Francisco men, the sum of $00.000
being paid in cash and the remainder was
to bepald from the profits of the mine.
These parties paid out $100,000 and
stopped. The property was purchased by
the Mountain Mines . Company (limited)
of London In 1804. the price being $200,000.
Since ?ipn -the â¢'.' expenditures <have
amounted to about $1,000,000 and the esti
mated annual profit on the matte copper
produced is $500,000. ' T
The oilbelt in the city of : Los Angele3
Is â¢'till so poorly, defined that many more
wells, are likely to be put down in tho
near future. A few years ago the resl
dents of WeÃtlake Park fancied that the
oii industry would never invade that sec
tion : The "Los Angeles Times points out
that they were mistaken and- says that
the same awakening .may. soon come to
the owners of pronerty on Figueroa and
Adams Â¦Â¦'Â¦ streets. * There is no guarantee
that by sinking to the depth of 2000 feet
or so "oil might not be ; tapped in that
S . The > demand for really first-class oil
tends continues. The oil districts in Kern
County and in many other parts of the
San JoaquHn Valley are filled up with
strangers who are looking ; over the land
and listening to: the stories of the con
tractors, stockholders and Â¦ land owners.
Many transfers have been -made in the
last few mnrrths.. Meanwhile the oil con
tinues 'to Â¦ flow and to : give hasis -to the
dreams of the many. Several deals have
beehmadd during the' past week, some of
these Â«in Southern â¢ California. ..-At : New
hall, in Southern California, a . quarter in
terest" in attract'- was sold Â¦at -the "rate
of> $100 -per acre, the land being unde
veloped, although surrounded by wells.
Land was selling in that .vicinity* a few
months ago at $5 to $10 per acre , and wat
not going very fast at those figures. 1
Ten " miles ' of lanfl along the Klamath
River has recently been bonded by J. H.
Barton for tne Postlethwalte Dred^lngr
Company In Siskiyou County. This com
pany .has dredgers on the Feather River.
They will begin to prospect on the Kla
math soon and If their findings are satis
factory will erect a large dredging plant
there. - * Â¦ "

: Intent.
*
The mystery surrounding the death- of
Annie : Schmid, which occurred at 231
Eighth street Saturday, night, has not yet
been solved. Ernest Kilian.whom the
police suspected of having committed
murder by poisoning the woman, is still
In the tanks at the City Prison and he will
not , be .booked until the detectives com
plete their investigation^ At present they
are inclined to the suicide theory.
. Killan Is a. carriage builder employed by
"Warren."& Malley. He-had r been living
with the, woman for the past ten years
and was "arrested in October," ISOB, for
beating her nearly to death. . Since that
trouble, the : couple have been living to
gether apparently very happy. *â¢
Saturday morning. Killan went to work
as . usual and ;when he. returned about
noon, he says, the ' woman " was .in fair
health. When .he \ came Â¦ home . again at
6:30 p. -m.', after his day's' work, -he' went
up in the bedroom and found the woman
lying on the-. bed. Â¦ He went- downstairs
again and says he did not notice that she
was suffering from- carbolic poisoning
.until his attention was drawn to .the fact
by Mrs. Green," a roomer In the ; house.
He immediately went for a doctor and Dr.
â¢J. C: Voje responded to the -call. The
physician had been treating the deceased
for the past five days for stomach trouble.
He'tried the usual treatment for carbolic
acid, poisoning, but he'was unable to save
her and "she died Â¦ in great agony. Dr.
Voje notified the Â¦ Morgue officials, .who
took -charge of the remains. "An empty
b'ottle ; which formerly held .the acid was
found near the bedside, also a bottle of
medicine. Kllian claims that ,he has had
the. acid in : the. house for. the past .five
months,- having bought it to use on a sore
foot. â¢ â¢ . â¢
E Saturday night Sergeant Wolf called at
the house to Investigate the case. , He
heard so many conflicting stories and find
ing a bottle which â¢ had contained- , port
wine which smelt strongly 0f.,, carbolic
acid 'in the bedroom of .the he
inquired â¢.-. where the liquor came from.
Killan stated that he gave the woman the
wine and that, he had done so on the ad
vice of the doctor. Sergeant Wolf then
took him to the City Prison:
Detectives Ryan and O'Day have been
detailed on the case and after a careful
Investigation are satisfied that it was a
case of suicide. They are still working
on the case, however. Killan Is held in
high esteem by his employers. Mr. Mal
ley called at the prison yesterday and
informed Killan that he would do all in
his power to help him. The Inquest will
be held to-day and it is probable that Kil
ian will be released.
Kllian is about 30 years old, while the
woman was twenty years his senior.

Morris Lsp;jmann and Louis Scholl bat
tered each other for two rounds yester
day aftesnoon In a back yard at 17 Mor
ris avenue. The battle -wated furiously
and both men were covered with blood,
but they fought on, amid the shouts- of
the select few who occupied points pf
var.tasre round the ring and the ecreams
of members of the fair s=ex who occupied
choice &oa.ts at kitchen windows. Finally
Llppmann suddenly dealt tscholl a heavy
light on the Jaw and he fell to the boards
a vanquished man. There were more
f-houts and screams and the contest
ended. Not so the enmity between the
contestants. The blows each had received
while the tight waged seemed to have add
eJ fuel to their anger, and a challenge for
a return bout was issued and accepted.
f livery Ught has a reason, and the one
between Scholl and Lippmann was not de
void of one. Both younp men are de
voted admirers of the Martin sisters. Hen
rietta and Reina. and both are frequent
callers at their home. 17 Morris avenue.
As fate decreed they both met In the fam
ily parlor, and it is due to that useful
room that a passage at arms was brought
about. On numerous occasions Lippmann
has gained possession of the parlor by
calling early. Scholl proved a strategist i
of no mean ability, and he on numerous ,
occasionÃ outmaneuvercd his rival by ar- ;
riving even earlier on the scene, and hold-
Ing the citadel. As a result Lippmann and i
Miss Henrietta had often be<>n compelled
to s!t on the Ftairs in the cold and pour
words of affection into each other's ears.
This struggle for possession of the much
us^d room could only have one ending,
and that was a challenge to combat.
Despite the protestations of the jrlrls
the men coolly went about arranging their
meeting. Dave Martin, a brother of the
girls, was taken into their confidence, as
was also Scou Simon, a brother-in-law.
The latter pair erected a ring in the back
yard and set a date for the match. The
men met according to agreement. Simon
acted as referee and Martin as tlme
keepor. Scholl and Lippmann fought from
the sound of the gong. In the nret round
Soholl landed on Lippmann's prominent
"beak" and goro flowed in quantity. The
second round saw the end. Lippmann
found a good opening and swung with
disastrous effect to his opponent.
The referee and the timekeeper after
ward became involved in a quarrel over
the number of seconds counted when
Scholl was down, and they donnÂ«Â»d the
"mitts." In a short space of time Simon's
eyes were in mourning and Martin's nose
â¢was aglow from repeated punching.
Friends then interfered and the second
fight came to an end.
Both young ladles decline to receive
further attentions of the ardent lovers,
and now Scholl and Lippmann are be
moaning their unwise conduct.

PARK POLICE NOW
GENUINE COPPERS
Under the New Charter They Become
Part of the Depart
ment.
The old park police station has been
abolished and now the park patrolmen,
both those mounted and afoot, report in
to the Stanyan-street station, otherwise
known as the Park station. The closing
at the park station caused considerable
surprise among the crowds that thronged
the driveways Saturday and yesterday,
for the change was not made until late
last week. The cause of it is the charter.
Under the old regime the park police
Â¦were separated from the regular depart
ment. They formed a body by therij
eelves. but under the charter they are at
tached to the regular focce. This carries
â¢with it a raise from $75 to $10) a month,
the blue uniform and the added dignity
of a seven instead of a nix pointed star.
They are now full and regular police offl
cert, and directly under the orders of the
Chief of Police. Consequently, the old
station was abolished and the new police
men were ordered to report at- the. regu
lar station.
Th<Â» Park Hospital, which occupied part
of the building used by the police. .has
b^en closed for a long time, but with the
removal of the, police station came the
report that the hospital, too. had i been
removed and that it would open at the
Rtanyan-street station. It will not. how
ever. When the last Board of Health
closed it it was closed permanently.

CELEBRATED THEIR
GOLDEN WEDDING DAY
The fiftieth wedding anniversary of Mr.
and Mrs. Jacob Label was celebrated yes
terday afternoon and evening at 120 Grove
street, the home of Mrs. F. M. Thall. the
daughter of the aged ' couple.
Day and night the friends of Mr. and
Mrs. Label called to pay their respects.
Jacob Label is an old resident of this city,
where he has resided since 1853.
THE fate of the advertising car seems to be resting on the decision of the case of Barnhart & \wasey vs. the Chief
of Police, in which it is attempted to restrain the Chief from stopping the Juggernaut the Market-street Railway
Company sees fit to let run over its lines every day. The Chief thought he would stop it because the company's
franchise calls for the running of cars for the convenience of passengers, not to scare them into buying goods of
those who can fake up the most ornate and sight-destroying poster.
The plaintiffs allege the Chief's action is unlawful and is interfering with their right to initiate gripmen and con
ductors into the mysteries of the advertising business. â¢ '_ â¢ â¢ :
The chief does not see it in that light, however. Visions of conductors and gripmen in the garb of sandwich men,
proffering transfers calling attention to the latest bargains, rushed before his eyes. He saw passengers being compelled,
to assist in the spread of commercial information in addition to paying their fare, and a variety of other things that
might make car riding a source of more profit to the company than the nickel and a more serious thing for the passen
ger than a trip downtown. So he got out in front and stopped the advertising car of the plaintiffs and declareoMt should
go no farther.
The question to be decided is one long and earnestly discussed in the East, as well as here. If a franchise to run
cars for the use of passengers carries with it the right to make the streets hideous with all kinds of shopping advice va
riously displayed, the chief wants to know it and he intends to ilnd out, and he has started by compelling the suit of
Barnhart & Swasey vs. the Chief of Police.
The matter of disfiguring signs upon every available fence has already become a matter for legislation before this.
Board of Supervisors as well as many past boards, but so far the solons have not taken up the Irresponsible and bediz
ened advertising car. The fence is an eyesore*and may be torn down and removed, but even if the cars be run oft
the track they may still flaunt their Invitations to buy and nothing can stop them until they can be cornered before
they leave the carhouse in the mornings. The suit will probably end in some ordinance with that purpose in view.
Mary's Cathedral was kept busy for a
time yesterday explaining to numerous
friends who telephoned congratulations,
that he was not the author of the verses
entitled 'The Battle of Dundee,' pub
lished in yesterday's Call. While admit

HOP SING TONG
PREPARES FOR A
MIGHTY REVENGE
High Explosives May Be
Used to Offset a Rival's
Great Strength.
â¢' The bitterness of the highbinder trou
ble, which has existed in Chinatown for
the past several months, has not abated.
Vengeance is sworn on the heads of the
Suey Sing Tong by the Hop Sings, and
indications are that the battle yet to
come will be long and bloody. The Suey
Sings have already commenced to ship
their members to the canneries in ;the
north, and the Hop Sings, who are great
ly /outnumbered by them at present, are
taking advantage of thi3 fact and will
cause the hostilities to be continued until
but a' handful of Suey Sing men are left
in the city and then they will attack them.
All this was decided upon at a meeting
of. the Hop Sing tong last night. The
organization was greatly; incensed at the
attempt made to murder its president,
Wong Shi Shu, early yesterday morning,
and proposes to take some terrible and
swift means of anniliating its enemies.
Reports that- high explosive will 'be used
wero spread broadcast yesterday, and the
police officials have been more than ever
watchful. " While the Hop Sings are afraid
to; meet their powerful adversary face to
face, at the present time, it may use se
cret agents and take revengejn much the
same manner as the Suey Sings sought to
spite the Wai Ting tong by shooting a
couple of innocent Sam Yup merchants
early in the month.
The police are equally as determined to
stop the wholesale murder which has been
rife in Chinatown recently. Â¦ \
Wong Goey, the Hop Sing man, who was
fearfully slashed by a cleaver in .. the
hands of a Suey Sing man early yester
day, morning, died at the Harbor Hospital
about three, hours after he had received
his injuries. The man's head had been
almost severed from his body and the
police pronounce the affair one of the
most bloody and brutal which has taken
place in the city for some time. As usual,
there is no clue as to the perpetrators
of the heinous crime and*it:is- likely that
they wiir remain at large. v -
:\Vhen the murderous highbinders en
tered the house of the Hop Sings' presi
dent they had no designs on the life of
Wong Goey, who was simply a cook, but
were after Wong Shi. Shu, the presi
dent. The fact that four of them went
there showed that - they expected resist
ance and were prepared to flght to the
bitter end. When a woman who - noUd
their entrance began to scream they
realized that they could not spill the blood
of the 'big game, so they contented them
selves with a-.cowardly attackon one of
his menials when he looked out of a' win-'
dow. - , : . .-â¢.,-
Chinese Consul General Ho Tow regrets
that crime is once more prevalent. He
made all possible efforts to < stop Â¦. the war
and 'assisted the police in every manner.
He will â¢ continue . to give the Â¦ officers '; all
the help they require and use his influ
ence and money to secure peace. - He says
that the Chief of Police misunderstood
his position In. asking, that the perpetra
tors of previous crimes be left unpunished
and says that now everything is straight
ened out. ' Â¦ .:Â¦ . ' - â¢ . .
