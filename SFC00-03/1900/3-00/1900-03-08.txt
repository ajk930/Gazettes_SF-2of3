LONDON, March 7.â At midnight the "War Office posted the following advices from Lord Roberts:
"Poplar Grove, March 7, evening.â We had a very successful day and have completely rout
ed the enemy, who are in full retreat. The position which they occupied was extremely strong
and cunningly arranged with a second line of entrenchments which would have caused us heavy loss
had a direct attack been made. " â¢ â¢ VC ; . .
"The turning movement was necessarily wide, owing to the nature of the ground, and the cavalry
and horse artillery horses are much done up. : ;...,_ ." . .
"The fighting was practically confined to the cavalry division, which, as usual, did exceedingly
well and General French reports that the horse artillery batteries did great execution among the
enemy.
"Our casualties are about fifty. I regret to say that Lieutenant Keswick was killed and Lieu
tenant Bailey was severely wounded, both of the Twelfth Lancers. Lieutenant DeKrespigny of the
Second Life Guards was severely wounded. Remaining casualties will be telegraphed to-morrow. <
"Generals De Wett and Delarey. commanded the Boer forces." ' "
The following was received from Lord Roberts earlier in the day:
"OSFONTEIN; March?, 4:30 p. m.â Our operations to-day promise to be a great success. T/he
enemy occupied a position four miles north and eleven miles south of the Modder River. I placed Gen
eral Colville's division on the north bank and General Kelly-Kenny's and Tucker's 'division, with cav
alry, on the south bank. The cavalry division succeeded in turning the enemy's left 5 flank, opening a
road for the Sixth division, which is advancing without being obliged to fire a shot up: to the present
time. The enemy are in full retreat toward the north and east :, They ,. are being closely, followed by
cavalry, horse artillery and mounted infantry, while Tucker's .'division, 'Col ville's Ninth division aid

USELESS SLAUGHTER,
DUE TO BULLER'S TACTICS
LONDON. March 7.â The aftermath of
Splon Kop , brings countless criticisms
from correspondents at the. front. Ben
nett Burlelgh In .the Telegraph writes:
"You can rely upon It that no one more
than General Buller. deplores.' the mistake
which led to the foolish evacuation of that
key of the Boer position. When the gen
eral retreat was ordered Buller waited by
the . single, part pontoon, part trestle
bridge until everybody was got safsly
across. The day previous be had critically
re-examined the positions held upon the
left, and had been repeatedly under the
flre of the snipers. Indeed, at least one
of the generals and - several of his staff
had to get him to retire behind cover, as
they thought he was unnecessarily risk-
Ing himself."
The Globe's correspondent Is particu
larly bitter about Splon Kop. "No one
knows," he writes "who gave the order to
retire: the whole business Is Inexplicable.
We met a staff officer on the way; he
' asked us what we were doing; we knew
nothing of the order, but presumed we
had better continue on our road. And so
ended a seventeen hours' fight. We gave
j the enemy a victory. The whole of War
ren's division had retired. Call It what
you like, it is a sad and deplorable busi
ness. There is no explanation; no one Was
; more surprised at our action than the
Boers themselves: Indeed, their officers
openly expressed their surprise to doctors.
If, owing to some unknown reason. It was
really necessary to take Spion Kop (al
though it was said to be decided week*
: ago that it would be an act of folly to at
tempt to do so), why give It up after,
sacrificing so many lives to take It? It la
a question which will have to be answered
very soon. A well . planned strategical
movement was to be carried out. and
every one felt satisfied that It would be
successful. In. the middle of It* the' whole
plan Is abandoned, and troops are de
tailed from all sides to perform a hercu
lean task, fraught with danger and disas

FRANCE PREPARED TO
FIGHT GREAT BRITAIN
PARIS. March 7. â An' extreme tension exists In the Anglo-French relations, and French official circles are considering'
the probability of war. An Important. official, who possesses, the. confidence of the Ministry, told a correspondent to
day that It would be useless to longer deny; the fact that Great Britain alms at attacking France.' He added It-had
been: evident some time that the English press was obeying instructions in making the most of .every trifling, offense '
â¢ given by the French press," while Ignoring , the graver Insults from the press' of other countries. . Moreover.- all of
.Â¦-' Britain's late preparations are known to be solely directed against France. Every step England has taken has been ;
met", with a corresponding precautionary-; step by France.- It was not weakness that made the French yield In 'the Fashoda
dispute, but moderation, though apparently -all -the moderation was^wasted In England's present temper. France has been
preparing for years, and is now. ready. to resist British aggression; â¢ 'â¢ f
The correspondent remarked these were somewhat startling statements and added he did not wish â¢to cable anything â¢
likely, to produce ibadblobd.^/ .^ 1,."- *."-Â¦"Â¦ V â¢-,'Â«. 'â¢'.;; . .' \ . . â¢". "-
The diplomatist in reply said: "I have put the case none too strong. Remember we do not wish for war. but England's
disposition is too evident, to be misunderstood. Consequently we .' have made all necessary precautions to avoid ;.being
taken at a disadvantage. Stores arid ammunition have been accumulated In the colonies In sufficient quantities- to enable
them, though isolated, to maintain a long, campaign. There are- 30.000 white troops in Tonquln and 50,000 in Algeria" under',
General Gallien. .who will deal, with any, expedition England may. send against them. In Madagascar there are nearly 10 000 -
and more will be sent shortly. These .will occupy strategic positions from which the whole British army will be unable
to move them. Everything is ready and we can- now. fold our' arms awaiting: England's first move.'.' â¢ â¢-â-â¢,"
.The correspondent . again said he hated to send news of this character, lest it prove mischievous, - whereupon the offi
cial answered:. "We don't mind. the publication of . the fact. â¢ Realizing England's public opinion, we have taken every pre-*
caution and are now. quite -.prepared to meet, her hostility. France Is ready for any eventuality,, and ..courts rather than;
avoids al,a 1 , contest for supremacy.- Publication will do more good than harm. English 'opinion has misunderstood French r "
moderation, "and .'you had better acquaintit with the true fitate of the case. The French fleet possesses' safe ; refuges, from
.which, the opportunities offering, it wlll| be able to cover, movements- against England's weak points," 'which are! perfectly
known, shouldvwar; be declared. ;*, Stranger things have happened than seeing the tri-color in Lbndori and Cairo. Remember.-'
however, we do not. wish- for, war unless It Is forced on us, but once forced we will give a good account : of Â¦ ourselves.'.'.'.
From all' points in .'the Transvaal .and Orange Free State every man and boy able to handle a rifle,
whose presence is not absolutely necessary elsewhere, is hastening to the nearest station to take the train
for Winburg, where the Commander in Chief of the Republican armies' is preparing to resist Lord Rob
erts' further advance,' and where a great, but not necessarily decisive, battle may be looked for at an
early day.' Not a few women are to be found in the Boer ranks.
LONDON, March B.â Lord Roberts has. again outflanked the Boers and Free Staters, and they
are retreating rapidly to the north and east, closely pursued by a strong force of British cav
alry and horse artillery, while no less than. 3o,ooo infantry are following in their track., For
some time Lord Roberts has had a growing commando of Boers intrenched , in his front on both
flanks of the Modder River, about -ten miles east of . Paardeberg. The strength of this commando
has been put at 4000, but as the trenches covered a space of fifteen milesr the number must
have been underestimated. The Boers were faced by the Ninth, Seventh and Sixth divisions,
while General French with his cavalry was at the last moment brought from the extreme; left of.
the British line to the extreme right, facing the Boer left.
The British operations opened with the cavalry working around the Boer left, covering the
march of the Sixth Division. The Boers at once fell back to; the north and east. The cavalry
and horse artillery followed closely, and the Seventh and Ninth divisions and guards brigade also
marched in pursuit. The Boers lost one gun, an immense quantity of forage and a number of
tents. The retreat has degenerated in a rout.
Roberts' headquarters last night were at Poplars Drift, which is probably eight or ten miles
east of Koodoosrand Drift. W
It is known that President Steyn within the last two or three days has been with this Boer
force. He is probably still with it, so that if it can be surrounded he may be captured. The Boer
tactics appear to have been elementary in the extreme, for they had no real defense on either
of their flanks, although their intrenchments were intricate, while" the nature of the country al
lowed the easy progress of the cavalry in whichever direction was deemed advisable. The ease
with which Roberts attained his object strongly indicates that the Boers never intended to make
a serious stand at this position, and that it was merely a screen to hide their real point of con
centration, or was a device to get the British to display their full strength. If either of these
suppositions be correct, the Boer designs were successful.
â¢ From other quarters of the war the reports are favorable to the British, except in the
northwestern province of Cape Colony, where the Dutch uprising is setting the Carnarvon district
on fire. In Natal Buller is pushing up reconnoitering bodies of troops northward and westward,
backed up by reinforcements. Scouts report that there are no Boers on the Natal side of Van
Reenans Pass. A still more heavy casualty list has been received from Buller of losses during the
last two weeks of February, affording evidence of the determined resistance of the Boers in the
final operations for the relief of Ladysmith. The list issued yesterday comprises 123 killed, 575
wounded and 54 missing. Adding these to the returns issued on Monday, it makes a total of
1859 for the fortnight named. Altogether, it may be> estimated that no less than 6000 British
troops were placed hors de combat by the operations of the relief column during the last ten
weeks.
General Clements has advanced as far as Oorlogspoort River. His next move will be to
the Orange River bridge. Gatacre's mounted infantry has gone to press the retreating Boers, who
have two guns in position on Bastards Nek.

HONOLUX.U, Feb. 34.â Kahiilui has had
one more case of plague. The victim was
a Chinaman in the detention camp. He
died on: Tuesday of . this, week and the
body has already been cremated. As the
man had been In- the detention camp since
the first outbreak the case Is not regarded
as a setback, the disease having been con
tracted probably before the quarantine
was . established. Rahul ui is still In strict
quarantine, and vessels calling there have
no connection with the shore. The steamer
Centennial ls In the harbor yet. .
Up to the 17th Hllo had had no more
trouble. The steamer Claudine. which ar
rived after visiting- Hawaii. Maul and
Molokal, was at Mahukona last .Friday
and Saturday, leaving on Saturday morn-
Ing. At that tlmÂ© It waa reported that "
there, had been no mora cases of plague ac
Hllo. Ine town was still In quarantine.'
It is thought by many that HMo^s troubles
are about over, as far as plague within
her own limits la concerned. . .
The Claudine called at Kamtakakal
on the way down and loaded 230 tons of
sugar into the bark lolanl there. The
fever epidemic on Molokal continues, but
It Is said to be lees general than It was.
Dr. McOettigan wrote to President Wood

that no danger is apprehended. .

MRS. H. H. OVERMANITS TWO LITTLE GIRLS
Enclosed find a picture of my two little girls, who couldn't be without their
Pe-ru-na. They have both had the measles since I last wrote to you. but even
through the sickness I gave them the Pe-ru-na.
"We have used Pe-ru-na constantly for the past two years with our .
children and have received the most satisfactory results. We would not >
be without it. The youngest one, Elsie, is the one that had bronchia/
trouble, and had it not been for your medicine she would have choked to
death. It has done wonders for her. Yours gratefully,
'(\f* Mrs. H. H. Overmann,
2865 Winslow Aye., Cincinnati, 0."
Mrs. L. G. Vandegriff. Carrolltoh. Ga.,
writes: "I Indorse your Pe-ru-na, I had
a little girl, afflicted with catarrh and
have had two physicians to treat her and
found, no relief. After -using two bottles
of your Pe-ru-na 6he ls sound and well. I
am now giving it to my other children."
Mr. Joseph Klrchenatelner, 87 . Croton
street, Cleveland, 0., says: "We have
used Pe-ru-na for eight years as our fam-
ily medicine. During the whole of that
time we have not had to employ a physi-
cian. Our family consists of seven, and we
always use it for the thousand and one ail-
ments to which mankind ls liable. We
have used it In cases of scarlet fever,
measles and diphtheria. Whenever one
of the family feel in the least 111, mother
always says: .'Take Pe-ru-na and you
will be well,' or, if we do not happen to
have any. 'We will have to get more Pe-
ru-na.' Pe-ru-na is always satisfactory
In colds and coughs."
Children are especially liable to acute
catarrh. Indeed, most of the affections of
childhood are catarrh. All forms of sore
throat, quinsy, croup, hoarseness, and
laryngitis are but different phases of ca-
tarrh. These affections.- In the acute
form, may, pass away without treatment.
but they leave a foundation -for chronic
catarrh In later years. Even Â¦ a slight
cold ls acute catarrh, and renders." the
mucous membranes of the head and
throat more liable to chronic catarrh aft-
erward. The child ls constantly assailed,
winter and summer, with catarrh. Affec-
tions of the stomach and bowels, colic .
and diarrhea, axe due to catarrhal de-

WITNESS IN

MURDERED
The Mangled Body pL R.

SUSPECT IS UNDER ARREST
â¢
Dead Man Would Hare Been a Strong
Witness for Leeper in His
Cas: Against Mrs.
Brouhard.
Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call.
BACRAMENTO, March 7.â There Is,: a
cape awaiting disposition in San Francisco
In which a man 'named J. M. Leeper
charges Mrs. Â¦ M. E.- Brouhard, "who con
ducts an employment agency near Seventh
and I streets,- this city, with frauS. The
hearing has been postponed to Saturilay
next. â¢;"Â¦ '*$?*$ . Â¦Â¦ . .
An important witness in Ihe prosecution
of the case, it has been said, would be
R. R. Watts, who roomed In the build
ing where the employment office is lo
cated. Watts will not appear at the ex
amination In San Francisco next Satur
day, for he lies at the Morgue In this
city to-night with his skull horribly
crushed and his body disfigured. Late this
afternoon two young men, W. J. Morgan
and D. B. Belt, were in the vicinity of
the overflow north of the Southern Paci
fic shops, when their attention was at
tracted to the dead body of a man, partly
submerged and partly resting on an Im
provised levee, built by the railroad com
pany. The back of the skull was crushed
In and the presence alongside 'of two
heavy pieces of slag, stained with blood
and matted with hair, told the story of
a brutal murder. . â¢
There must have been a frightful strug
gle on the water's edge, for the dead
man's hands were clenched on ' tufts . of
the grass which covers the levee. Sheriff
Johnson and Coroner McMullen took
charge of the body and began an imme
diate Investigation into the case. The ap
pearance of the remains indicated that
the murder occurred a. week ago. Letters
were found on the person of the- dead man
establishing his identity as R. R. Watts
and revealing the fact that he had -a -
mother and a son, Gaylord Watts, resid
ing at Corvallis, Or. : n.
A letter was also found In his clothes
from George W. Odell. the partner of Mrs.
Brouhard in the employment business. In
which he explained how he came to open
a letter addressed to Watts, saying that
he. had done so in the presence of a per
son with the initials M. E. B. These, by
tbe way, are the Initials of Mrs. M. E.
Brouhard. Another letter was. found on
the person of the murdered man from E.
L. Ballard, Sliver City, Idaho, inclosing a
clipping from a newspaper which was a
notice of the forfeiture of Watts' interest
In the Brick Pomeroy mine in Carson dis
trict, Owyhee County. Idaho. The forfeit
ure of the Interest ls to Dr. J. N. Weston.
Mrs. Brouhard and Odell came up from
San Francisco to-night and were subjected
to a searching Inquiry' at the hands of
Sheriff Johnson.
The case in San Francisco In which
Watts ls declared -to have an Interest as
a witness ls one In which J. M. Leeper
of that city charges Mrs. Brouhard with
obtaining money under false pretenses.
Leeper, It appears, owned a lodging house
In San Francisco which he desired to dis
pose of. and, therefore, placed an adver
tisement in one of the San Francisco
papers, which was answered by Mrs.
Brouhard in person, -Instead : ox .' paying
him cash for his property she proposed
that he accept shares In a fabulously rich
mino. which she valued at $150 each. Ac
cording to th*Â» story told by I^eeper he
turned over the, lodging house to the
woman, but when he asked for his shares
she , Informed him that they had gone up
from $150 to $500 each.
He threatened prosecution, but the
woman, so he claims, inveigled him to
accepting compensation for the' loss of
Ijls lodging-house In the shape of a $100
fÂ»er month position, which did not last
ong. The woman was arrested here on
a warrant sworn out In San Francisco,
At 11:30 o'clock to-night Sheriff John
son placed under arrest Charles. Bowen
on suspicion of complicity In the murder
of Watts. So far as the Sheriff can learn
Watts was last seen alive In the com
pany of Bowen. Bowen was a frequenter
of. the employment office conducted by
Mrs. Brouhard. His , story Is not satis
factory to the Sheriff and he will be kept
In custody.

Friends . of the , French reciprocity treaty
In the Senate Intend to make an effort to
secure ratification of the treaty during
the coming week. If necessary. It will bo
made the subject of caucus action. Aa
the matter now stands, the treaty Is prac
tically deadlocked by a motion to re^er
it to the Finance Committee. It has al
ready been favorably ; reported from the
Committee on Foreign Relations. -and was
briefly considered In executive session.
The opponents of the treaty include the
entire New England delegation, which ln
cludes.the best parliamentary tacticians
in the Senate. If a vote could be reached,
it io claimed, the treaty could easily mus
ter the necessary two-thirds to Insure its
ratification, but the opposition has thus
far been unable to prevent decisive ac
tion, f '
So bitter Is the contest over this treaty
that the steering committee has been un
able, thus far, to bring about an amicable
adjustment of the difficulty. At a brief
meeting of that I committee to-day the
subject was under consideration- and it
is understood that it will Â«be referred to
a Republican caucus which Is to be Tield
in a few days "for the purpose of trying
to untangle some of the snarls into which
the Republican party in the Senate has
been drawn by recent events.
Quay Fight Drawn In.
Friends of Mr. Quay are largely re
sponsible for the breach in 'the steering
committee's programme and some plain
talking probably will : be indulged in at
the forthcoming caucus.
In the meantime friends of the French
treaty . are anxious to avoid making a
party question of - It, as they are relying
upon a large Democratic vote to assist In
Its ratification. Opponents of the treaty
are urging political objections to It and
openly declare that its ratification will
be | disaster, hot only to McKinley's . ad
ministration, but to the business interests
of the country. , \
They claim that the treaty ls poorly
drawn and . the benefits to . be derlvci
from It will be enjoyed by a few giant
Interests at the expense of a great num
ber of smaller but equally deserving en
terprises. â¢ Â¦ " Â¦-
Senator Aldrlch. who ls leading the op
Â¦posltlon to the treaty, asserts that he
does not wish to defeat a reasonable and
properly framed reciprocity treaty .be
tween the United States and France, and
only wishes a fair opportunity for the
Finance Committee of the Senate to
thoroughly): analyze the pending treaty
and point out Its defects, with a view to
securing what he believes to be neces

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, March 7.â
Puerto Rico's pitiable plight has again
been brought to the attention of the War
Department by Hrlgadier General Davis,
Governor General of the Island. In an of
ficial report received by Acting Secretary
Melklejdhn, General Davis states thattho
natives are bordering on starvation; and
he fears an outbreak of lawlessness and
illness. Workmen and their families who
are without employment are. coming Into
town and begging for food. It had been
the"; intention' of General t Davis to discon
tinue' the' distribution of "free" ."rations on
March 1, but finding that the people were
unable to obtain the necessaries of life, ha
recently asked the department for 500 tons
of rice, codfish and, bacon, which will bo
sentjon March 16.' A letter received to
day urges- that another shipment of 800
tonÃ be made as promptly as possible.
â¢General Davis suggested ; that he be
given authority ."Â¦Â¦ to â¢â¢ improve . the public
roads. He thinks he, can employ 25.000
men. for three months. I Including wages;
tools and supplies, the -cost of their em
ployment will be about $225,000 a month.
There will be required for this work 15,000
shovels;. 3ooo picks., 6ooo. pick handles, 1000
metal wheelbarrows and 500 hammers: for
breaking road, material. . â¢ â¢ -, Â¦ v â¢
Should the department grant the au
thority Â¦ requested. General Davis - says it
will enable the Island to tide over the pe
riod preceding the new industrial and eco
nomic conditions provided for in the pend
ing legislation. . â¢_* -' - ? Â¦
Acting Secretary Melklejohn ls unable
to authorize General Davis to place the
men at work or* the roads, as the depart
ment has no funds for tnis purpose. PreÂ«.
ident McKinley : recently considered the
advisability of recommending to Congress
an appropriation of J3.000.000 to be. used In
alleviating the Puerto Rican: distress,* but
decided to ask that the customs duties
collected; on products coming- from that
island be made available for expenditure

Massachusetts Senator Supports the

WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Senate
seldom accords to any of its members a
greater compliment than it gave to-day to
Lodge of Massachusetts. The announce
ment that he would deliver a speech. on
the Philippine Question, supporting the
administration, drew to the Senate every
Senator now in the city and to the gal
leries an exceptionally large number of
auditors. Throughout the delivery of the
speech, despite .the fact'that It consumed
three hours, the Massachusetts Senator
was given close attention. Lodge's speech
was based on the bill Introduced by
Spooner of Wisconsin vesting In the Presi
dent authority to govern the Philippines
until Congress should otherwise provide
by legislation. He argued In favor of the
bill- â¢ , -
Soon after Lodge had concluded the Sen
ate adjourned out of respect to the mem

of a threatened epidemic and hinted at
direful results if it were not allowed to
pillage the public treasury.
Men who would plot to plunder the
funds of the taxpayers that they might
be enabled to get both snouts and torelegs
in the public trough can safely be counted
upon to strike at the city itself In their
scheme of (spoliation.
Did the death of a sick Cnlnaman in one
of the hovels in the heart of Chinatown
present the opportunity for plunder? It is
reasonable to suppose that these creatures
of Phelan's would not hesitate at a gigan
tic conspiracy which would mean a death
blow to the Interests of the city and her
citizens. It is reasonable to suppose that
such men would have San Francisco ad
vertised as a plague spot, overlooking the
fact that they themselves were the most
dangerous and most menacing malady
that threatens the community.
It is reasonable to suppose that such
men would strangle the city's commerce,
would cast a blight on the homes and
ruin the prospects of the future that they
might loot the public treasury while the
people were downcast at the outlook and
hiding their heads in shame for having
made such a condition possible by placing
In office a man who has toyed with their
confidence and has attempted to deliver
the city into the hands of an organized
gang of political brigands.
The bubonic plague fake caps the climax
of the Indignities and the outrages which
Phelaniem has heaped upon San Fran
cisco. .
What do the business men and the tax
payers think of a reform government that
plunges the city into darkness after mid
night, placing the citizens at the- mercy
cf thugs and thieves? How do they view
that reform which permits filth to ac
cumulate on the streets and highways?
These things are done under the pre
tense of being in the line of retrenchment
and economy. Can the citizens take stock
In Buch a plea when the very man who
makes It plots through the agency of his
lieutenants to loot the public treasury?
OFFICIAL DELAY.
Board of Health Discusses the Chlna-
town Quarantine.
The Board of Health, at Its regular
meeting last night, discussed the suspi
cious death of the Chinese laborer in the
basement of the old Globe Theater Tues
day night. Dr. Williamson brought up
the subject by referring to the suspicion
that the Chinaman had died from the
bubonic plague, and called up Health
Officer O'Brien to explain the circum
stances attending his demise.
Dr. O'Brien said he had received notice
of the death of the Chinaman, and after
consulting with his confreres, he conclud
ed to make a thorough Investigation. Al
ter satisfying himself that there was some
ground for the suspicion that the China
man had died from the effects of the
plague, he communicated with Chief ot
police Sullivan.
It was then decided to establish a strict
quarantine in the infected district. He
referred to Chinatown as a â¢'magnincent
feeding ground" for the disease.
Dr. Keilogg, bacteriologist of the Healtn
Department, said he had dissected tne
glands in the region of the groin of the
dead man, and found some very suspicious
bacilli. With the assistance of Dr. Kln
youn. Federal quarantine officer, he made
a thorough microscopic examination, i-ut
was unaole to positively say whether or
not the -bacilli were those of the bubonic
plague. He innoculated several guinea
pigs with the germs found in the glands
of the Chinaman and was anxiously wait
ing for the result. It would take from
two to four days, he said, before the ex
periment would prove successful. In case
the Innoculated pigs die within a reason
able time a post mortem will be held to
determine whether or not tne germs are
those of the plarue. , ?
Dr. Coffey. one of the eurgeons of the
Market Street Railway Company, then
addressed the board. After announcing
that the company was only too anxious
to co-operate with the board to prevent
the disease from spreading he said that
the people living in the Western Addition
were deprived of visiting the business por
tion of the city on account of the cars
of the Sacramento and Clay street lines
having been shut off from passing
through the suspected district. He aslted
that the cars be allowed to run through
the district as heretofore. ' .
y "We don't want to interfere with your
efforts in establishing a strict quaran
tine " he said. "On the contrary, we are
very ready to assist you In every 'possi
ble way. As the mattfr stands at the
presenrtime even the mall car Is not al
lowed to pass through Chinatown. Allow
ub to run our cars through the district
and we will promise that no passengers
will be allowed to get on or off within the
proscribed limits of Chinatown.
Chief Sullivan said he had given orders
to Captain Wittman to allow the mall car
to' run through to the ferry. He wanted
the car thoroughly .fumigated on Its re
turn to the carhouse, as, he did not want
to take any chances on a spread of the
disease.
Dr. McCarthy said he thought there
would be no danger If proper precautions
were taken. ;
Dr. Bazet said that the policemen who
are detailed In Chinatown were In as
much danger of contracting the disease
as the passengers on the cars that pass
through the quarter. He suggested that
the company be forced to fumigate i Its
cafs some time before they leave the
carhouse. /
Dr. Coffey replied that the railroad peo
ple were only too anxious to do every
thing that might be asked of them by the
Board of Health. He was in favor of
Dr. Bazet' b suggestion to have the 'cars
two years In accordance with the highest
wisdom and best possible Judgment, but
there should be no question among tha
American people as to the duty and Â¦wis
dom of now uniting in a determined effort
to take- the situation* as it stands, and
to so conduct the affairs of our country
as to add the most to -its glory, honor,
welfare and prosperity. It Is a frier.dly
struggle for commercial supremacy. In
which our rival nations are using their
best efforts, and I say, let us In a friendly
but determined spirit use our best effort*
also."
The Island of Guam.
The general had & most enjoyable visit
at Guam. It was made under orders from
Washington, and he haa his report upon
the island ready for delivery to the Prss
ldent. * .
"It Is a beautiful Island about twenty
nine miles long and from three and a
half to ten miles in width," he said. "I
rode over a great deal of it. traversing ltÂ»
length and crossing It three times. I rls
lted all the towns and was much pleased
with the people. Their hospitality and ap
parent desire to express good feeling to
ward Americans was very gratifying.
"The harbor San Luis de Apra Is very
good and can be Improved by a moderate
expenditure. The climate is very much,
like that of Honolulu, except that it really
has no dry season, the part of the year
of least rain having gentle trade wind
showers nearly every day. and often sev
eral such showers during the day."
BIG DECEPTION PLANNED.

Wheeler were made at a meeting of thÂ«
Blue and Gray Lejrlon at the Great North

THERE la no bubonic plague In
San Francisco. The sensational
etatement emanating from the
Board of Health that there was a
case of the dread disease In
Chinatown 1b looked upon by the dtl
*ens as a bold attempt of the department
to blackmail tbe city out of funds to feed
a horde of hungry office-seekers who
compose Mayor Phelan'B only following.
The most dangerous plague which
threatens San Francisco Is not of the bu
bonJe type. A plague of politics brought
to the city by a Mayor whose chief, char
acteristic Is to bargain and barter In the
powers given him by the new charter and
by him transmitted to a Board of Health
Â¦which haÂ» scandalized the community by
its extravagance and Inefficiency, is the
malady which not only menaces the com
mercial Interests, the prosperity and
future of the city, but Is striking at thÂ«
verx foundation of Its government.

In their efforts to assist the Mayor in
fulfilling his pre-election promises of pat
ronage, the members of this Board of
Health have made dire threats of venge

not submit to their demands for money â
Â»ot to bÂ» expended for the city's good, but
to bÂ« poured Into tha pockets of the
curbttone heeler* who are howling for
their pound of flesh from the man whom
the new charter has made czar of San
Francisco.
Threatened blackmail and a system of
brigandage, planned by men for whose In
duction into office Mayor Phelan is re
sponsible-. Is the plague that San Fran
cisco needs fear the most.
This Board of Health was appointed un
der the provisions of the new charter.
Dr. WT. E. Hopkins, appreciating
that his reputation In the community
would crumble if he remained with tho
hoard In the event of its plans to plunder
the city being- carried into execution, pre
sented his resignation and returned to the
r<->alm of decency.
The old Burns Health Board was a E&lnt

created by Phelan. Hardly had the mem

chairs than they besan to discuss the pos-

MISS SAIDEE WALSH
GREETED BY FRIENDS
Brilliant Contralto Makes Her Debut
in the World of Song at
the Palace.
Miss Saldee Walsh made her debut tn
the world of song under the guidance of
Professor Joseph Greven at Maple Hall.
Palace Hotel, last evening. Scores of thÂ«
young artist's friends greeted her and for
each song she sang they demanded an
encore, and sent her from the stage bear
ing a load of choicest blossoms.
Miss Walsh looked regal in an elegant
gown of green and black brocaded silk.
The Jupe was made en tralne and the cor
sage decollete. A trimming of soft, fluffy
pink chiffon brightened the corsaga and
front of the skirt.
Professor Greven was assisted In pre
senting Miss Walsh by Miss Lilly L. Roe
der, Hugh N. Callender, H. Winfred Goff
and Charles W. Betts.
Miss Walsh is the possessor of an Ideal
contralto voice. It Is rich and full,' and
above all, sympathetic, this characterlstlo
being ever prominent during her rendi
tion of Dudley Buck's "Sunset," her in
troductory song. Miss Walsh also sang:
"He Was a Prince" and "Habanera" and
the gypsy song from "Carmen." In the
selections from "Carmen" Miss Walsh
found an opportunity to use the full
power and exercise the most technical
control of her voice, and her friends werÂ«
happy, as was she. that the opportunity
was present. Mr. Uetts. a basso of great
power sang "Deep in the Mine": Hush N.
Callender rendered Lohengrin's "Declar
ation" and "Good-Night, my Child"; Miss
Lilly L. Roeder" rendered "Agathe's Aria"
(Frelschutz) and "If Thou Didat Lova
Me." Miss Roeder sang with pleasing ef
fect, and on each occasion was compelled
to respond to an encore;
driven from their homes and they have
lived in wagons and under trees and they
are all in tne most abject poverty. I saw
once a band of seventy coming toward
our lines and they had sent a long way
ahead of them a little child carrying a
reed with a white flag bound to it. They
had all been driven from their homes by
their own people.
"As for the soldiers coming home I can
not say anything.- It is too soon yet to
make any prediction. Their work Is near
ly done but the bands of marauders are
still at large and are giving some trouble.
Aguinaldo had at one time 20,000 effectivo
men. but that number has been reduced
until now he has but - a"- remnant of his
former forces.
"About keeping the islands and their
value to us as a possession I can only
â¢ay we have had this war thrust upon us
and now. with the conditions as they are,
eventually good will come to us through
our connection with the vast people in
the Far East.
"We must consider that about one-third
the population of the earth Is concentrated
In the eastern half of ABla and that these
vast multitudes are rapidly learning to
appreciate the advantages, and â¢ I might
add, the necessity of high civilization, and
they are also learning to realize the com
fort which is enjoyed by the people of .the
most civilized nations, in the - possession
and . use of the products, manufactures
and mechanical developments which are
there found.
Commercial Possibilities.
"Europe and America must purchase
the silks, teas, coffee, hemp, spices and
products of the handiwork of the people
of the Orlerit, and this immense popula
tion needs articles which American farms
and factories are producing cheaper and
better than those which are produced
anywhere else â¢on earth. Cotton cloth,
such as is manufactured in Southern cot
ton mills, is needed by the people of the
East to the enormous value of four. to five
thousand million dollars. It will be want
ed by them for clothes, sheets, ' pillow
cases, curtains, sails for their Innumer
able vessels, and countless other pur
poses for which- It 2s used.
"Shoes for their feet and hats for their
heads will be demanded. 'Nails and screws
will be needed for their houses and barbed
wire for their farms; sewing machines,
typewriters, farming Implements., loco

in New York and other great cities. Steel

"Two years ago the noblest emotions

GENERAL WHEELER came ashore
from the Warren last evening and
went at, once to the Palace Hotel.
He looks well after his service in
the Islands, but he has that thin,
gaunt appearance worn by every man who
has come out of the Orient to the home
country. He says he feels well and glad,
both that he went and that he Is back
again. He enjoyed the trip home espe
cially, for the Journey was punctuated by
stops at Guam and Honolulu, and about
both these places the general Is enthusi
astic. But in speaking of Manila and the
Philippines he gets down to facts and
figures, and reasons from them that this
country should hold what It has. He
talks guardedly, however, after the habit
of military men, and he declines to dis
cuss the affairs of the islands Â£ except
where they do not touch upon the policy
of the home Government or the govern
ment of the new possessions.
Seated In his room In the Palace and
surrounded by his trunks and satchels, he
received visitors cordially and seemed
glad to exchange items, for the general
has been forty days on the trip home and
there has been a great deal happening in
those forty days of importance to him
and of which he knew nothing.
It was news to him that Underwood had
been appointed to the place on the Ways
and Means Committee that was being held
for him. It was news, too, that his name
was not being called on the- roll of the
House; but he attributes this to the fact
that he Is absent and not as signifying
that he is no . longer a member of the
body.
"It was understood," said he, "that
when I went to the Philippines I would
return In time for Congress. It was al
ways my Intention to return in time, and
I am still a member of the House.
There is no case where a Congress
man lost his seat. for having accepted a
commission in the volunteer forces."
The. general sent his resignation as a
brigadier general to Washington on No
vember 28 last. This is now in the hands
of the President, but it has not yet been
acted upon. General Wheeler, while irt
Manila, placed himself in the hands of
the Government as to whether or not he
should remain in the islands or adhere to
his original intention, but as. he believes
the rebellion is nearly over, in the absence
of specific orders he followed his original
plan and returned.
His Island Service.
As to his service In the islands, the
general will only say he did all he could.
Not that it. was as much -as he wished,
but ii was as much as opportunity of
fered. He was on the line for five months,
in command of the first brigade of Mac-
Arthur's division, and during part of that
time he was actively engaged in skir
mishing through the northern part of the
island.
About the islands themselves, the gen
eral talks freely and Intelligently. He
has been through some of the
most important provinces, and he
has estimated their value as pos
sessions of this country with the skill
of a trained political economist. He be
lieves their future will pay for their past,
but he adds the -of t-repeated statement
that their position is the result' of a war
thrust upon us, and we cannot turn back
now and he declines, too, to say how
long It will take them to pay for the blood
that has stained their sod or for the rav
ages of their pestilences. Of the rebel
lion he says "it is practically over."
"The rebellion itself is entirely wiped
out, with the exception of a few Dands of
marauders without heads and without or
ganization," said the general. "They can
not come together, and I do not believe
they can reorganize to any extent during
the rainy season. I do not believe Agui
naldo has left the island, although It
would not be particularly hard for him to
do so. -Fishing boats pass up and
down the coast, lines and from them to
the mainland, and any of these could
take him away, but If he reached any
place outside the Jurisdiction of this
country I am sure he would make him
self known. He- is not far off, I. am
sure for Just before I left a Filipino told
me he could put a. communication in Agui
naldo's hands within a short time. We
have captured several of his Govern
ment officers and his family, still I be
lieve he will get away if he can.
"On the part of the Island where
I served the feeling of the peo
ple Is one of friendliness for Amer
ica and the Americans. The cities are
well governed and schools are being es
tablished all over the Islands. In the out
lying districts only Spanish and na
tive languages are taught, but
in Manila English is part of the public
school course. I was not in Manila very
much, but I understand the natives are
taking kindly to the new language.
A Territorial Government.
"I .believe the people are ready for a
certain kind of self-government. They
could be given the power to make laws
under such a system of government as
has been adopted for our Territories.
They are capable of that amount of
general self-government. The munici
pal governments, however, are all
in the hands of the natives, and they
get along without trouble or friction.
Under a Territorial form the Islands could
be well controlled. .
"The military authority is gradually
giving way to the civil. The natives have
no fear of the soldiers and there is very
little trouble between the trocps and the
people. In Pangasinan, Just before I left,
the head men of fourteen barrios, or coun
ties, came to me and all signed a state
ment to the effect that they had no com
plaint against the men of the army, or
against any individual soldier. Every one
of the head men signed the statement^in
a clear hand and all seemed well edu
cated. This was In the northern part of
the Island, about ninety miles from Ma
nila. The feeling Is the same all through
the northern provinces and through the
scuth as well, except in Cavite. It was
in Cavite Â¦ that the rebellion . started: It
was from Cavite that Aguinaldo came,
and it was largely from among the men
of Cavite that he appointed his officials.
As a consequence the friends of Aguin
aldo and his friends' friends are keeping
the bitterness alive. Then, too, there Js
the old complaint that the, natives were
kept out of Manila when that city felL

"Many of the natives are against the

statement that If they will only hold out

CONSUL UTTERS
VEILED THREAT
HO YCW, Consul General and
representative of the Chinese
population of San Francisco,
caused to be posted yesterday
throughout Chinatown about 100 offi
cial circulars, decrying the action of
the Board of Health as unjust and
severe. He states that his people have
suffered without any Justification, and
that should such action be continued
or attempted nsraln he will Invoke tha
Intervention of the treaty existing
between this country and China, for
the protection of the latter's subjects.
This morning representatives of the
Chinese, medical and legal, will appear
before the Board of Health at the In
stance of the Consul and demand their
rights in the premises.
The Chinese Six Companies, com
posed of merchants, held a meeting
last night and ratified' the Consul's
proclamation, also volunteering money
and assistance to prevent a repetition
of any future action of a similar char
acter.
Following Is a translation of the
proclamation:
CONSUL GENERAL HO VOW.
I exhort my people to not become excited because of the recent
action taken by Board of Health and the police. I deeply regret that
the transaction of the past day should have been permitted, and
should thia outrageous conduct be continued I will invoke the pro
tection of the treaty now existing between the United States and
China.
I have investigated the case which has been attracting the atten
tion of the health officials and over which so much flurry has been
made. I find that the man whose death occurred at 1001 Dupont
street had been suffering from a common ailment over a month and
during that time had an operation performed, after which he suf
fered a relapse. Other deaths of a similar character frequently occur
here. There is no excuse for the blockade which has been placed on
the Chinese quarter, and business should not have been stagnated
and merchants inconvenienced until something of a nature to war
rant such proceedings had developed.
I ask that you keep the peace until a thorough investigation can
be made. The authorities have not dealt, fairly with us, "but I hope
that they will soon discover their error and remove the ban they
have placed upon us.
We have sent our representatives before the Board of Health
demanding fair treatment and to see that a thorough examination
of the glands in this case be made. HO VOW,
Chinese Consul General for the port of San Francisco.

of the barn.
Dr. Baum then moved that the cars of
the Sacramento and Clay street lines be
allowed to go throush- Chinatown, pro
viding that after the cars are returned to
the barn they are fumigated, and that
no passenger be allowed to get on or off
any car while it passes through the Chi
nese district.
Chief Sullivan said he would have his
policemen accompany the cars from
Stockton to Kearny street to see that the
passengers did not violate the quarantine
order. He also asked that the passengers

while passing through the infected dls
"I don't want to interfere with the
rights of the traveling public." he said,
"but I am determined to prevent the peo
ple from boarding the cars while they
pass through Chinatown. If the passen
gers alight from the cars within the pro
scribed boundaries I intend to quarantine
them Just as we are doing with the resi
dents of the district."
Dr. Gesford of the marine hospital said
he had received orders from Washington
to do all in his power to assist the health
authorities in preventing a spread of the
disease. He announced that about 300
ounces of Haffelklne's serum was on Its
way here from Washington and would
if necessary be used in lighting the dis
ease.
Another meeting of the board will be
held In a few days to further discuss the
matter.
CHINATOWN BLOCKADE.
Cry of Indignation Rises From the
Chinese.
Chinatown remained in quarantine
yesterday. Ropes were stretched across
the principal streets leading into the Chi
nese districts, and squads of policemen
turned the crowds into other thorough
fares. Under the orders of the Board of
Health no persons were allowed to enter
or pass out of the supposed infected dis
trict, and these instructions were _ car
ried out to the letter by the special police
detail on guard.
At 1 o'clock yesterday morning the first
action of the Chief of Police was to
drive every white person out of the
quarantined section. This being accom
plished, officers took up their vigil, two
at each street leading into the Mongolian
district. The police were placed under
the control of Sergeants Duke, Chris
tlanson, Bush, Campbell, Shea and
Patrick Mahoney. Three watches were
made up and each squad served for
eight hours apiece.
Confusion Among Chinese.
A greater part of the Chinese popula
tion had retired when this action was
taken, and the seriousness of the situa
tion was not realized until after 6 o'clock
yesterday morning. The Chinese found
themselves blockaded, and their first
thought was that the police had inter
fered on account of the highbinder war
now In progress. Many tried to run the
lines, but were stopped and sent back to
their quarters.
About 2000 Chinese . and Japanese
cooks, waiters and servants who are
employed about town, and who en
tered Chinatown last nightâ applied
to be released that they might per
form their duties. Their requests met
with refusal, and consternation reigned.
About town employers waited for their
help, hotels and private families for their
cooks, but the menials did not put in ap
pearance at the usual hour. At the
Palace Hotel the kitchen was In serious
need of help, and relief was sought
from employment, agencies. Other places
suffered as severely, and soon there was
a rush of angry citizens and business
men for police headquarters. At the
California-street station Lieutenant Esola
listened to the troubles of about fifty
employers of Chinese and received the
brunt of their indignation because he was
unable to do anything for them. , ' ,-
Many Chinese had prepared to leave the
city and had purchased tickets days be
fore. Seventy-six were prevented from
sailing on the America Maru and about
four times that number on the river and
coast steamers. Merchants found it Im
possible to conduct their business within
the limits of Chinatown, and closed their
doors soon after opening them. Delivery
wagons carrying milk and provisions for
the Chinese were stopped, and all life
seemed suppressed in the Mongolian ter
ritory.
Police on Blockade Duty.
The two police squads, which were re
cently detailed to weed out highbinders
and gamblers . were added to the squad
doing guard duty, and not a single police
man was permitted beyond the stretched
ropes. Their absence added to the scene
of desolation, and the Chinese had mat
ters of peace practically in their own
hands. The unusual proceedings pre
vented about half of the Chinamen
from appearing on the street at all, and
cannon balls might have been shot from
one end of each thoroughfare to the other
without causing, any disastrous results.
Large crowds of curiosity seekers, hearing
that a blockade was In progress, loitered
along Kearny street all day and took in
the ludicrous points of the situation.
The quarantined district included the
blocks bounded by Kearny, Broadway,
Stockton and California, The cable lines
on Sacramento, Jackson, Clay and Wash
ington streets were stopped, and traffic
was badly crippled. Pedestrians were
obliged to walk over steep hills and many
blocks out of their way. In many In
stances, to reach their destination.
Despite the precautions taken by the
police, the blockade was practically in
effectual. It is said that notwithstanding 1
the fact that 2000 servants were confined
within the quarantine lines at 6 o'clock
yesterday morning, most of them were at
their places of employment before 11
o'clock. Most of the escapes were made
by way of Stockton street. Underground
passages and alleys served to accommo
date many, while others climbed over

roofs and landed In the streets at points
where the officers had not been stationed.
Consul General Indignant
Much indignation was expressed through
the Chinese quarter when the action of
the Board of Health became known. Con
sul General Ho Vow took immediate ac
tion and investigated the case under dis
cussion. He says he discovered that there
was no justification for any rigid meas
ures, as the subject had not succumbed to
bubonic plague, but had been afflicted with
the same ailment as had brought death to
many other of his countrymen during the
years of Chinatown's existence in this
city. The merchants, when they found
the havoc wrought to their, trades, rose
with the cry that they were being perse
cuted and made the sufferers ; fn some
political scheme. The Consul General, who
realized that the crisis had been reached
among the people he represented, lost no
time in issuing a circular which was post
ed In every conspicuous place through
Chinatown, asking 'them to remain com
posed at the same time condemning -the
city officials' action as wrong and unjust.
The merchants, who compose the Six
Companies, met last night and ratified the
Consul's proclamation. This morning the
Consul General, acting In conjunction with
them, will have legal -and medical repre
sentatives before the Board of Health.
They will demand that the rights of the
Chinese be respected* and in the event of
the death of Wong Chut King being pro
nounced a's having resulted from bubonic
plague they will demand that the glands
be given to the Chinese for further exam
ination.
Privileges of Mail Carrier*.
A mall carrier named John Dougherty
was allowed to enter the lines by the po
lice, having mall matter for distribution
in hiÂ« possession* His demand for admit
tance was at first refused by the officers,
but he pointed out to them- that they
were intercepting United States mails, and
he was then allowed to ! continue on his
way. When he went to pass out again ho
was stopped and held within the lines. He
communicated with his superiors and an
agreement was finally effected by wWch
mail carriers would be allowed . to enter
the quarantined section with a health of
ficer, who would disinfect the letters
before they were taken away.
Federal Business Crippled.
Customs Collector Jackson yesterday
afternoon -sent a pointed communication
to the Board of Health, asking whether
the board considered San Francisco an in
fected port, in which case, he announced,
he would, in comformlty with the Federal
quarantine regulations, refuse to grant
clearance to any vessel in this harbor.
He had not received a reply. up to the
close of office hours. â¢
The quarantine in Chinatown demoral
ized Custom-house business yesterday.
There were two large steamers at the
docks discharging cargoes from thÂ© Orient
consigned to Chinese merchants, and the
merchants being quarantined were de
barred from coming down town to swear
to their entries. Not a single entry was
filed yesterday of any consequence. Brok
ers say that the loss to Chinatown mer
chants will be heavy If the quarantine is
continued for any length of time.
Two Chinese Customs brokers made
their escape yesterday morning from the
tabooed quarter by passing along roofs
and landing in a saloon facing Kearny
street. They will reside in the Caucasian
quarter hereafter. *
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock Issued an order yesterday that no
more Chinese habeas corpus deportation
cases would" be heard by him pending the
quarantine.
Chief Dunne of the ChinesÂ© Bureau said
that the business of the bureau had been
virtually suspended, as no- witnesses
would be allowed to leave Chinatown and
the result would be a serious congestion
In the work of landing Chinese.
MERCHANTS READY.
In a Public-Spirited Way They Prof
fer Assistance.
A committee of the Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday afternoon visited the
Mayor and the Committee on Health of
the Board of Supervisors with a view of
suggesting measures and affording assist
ance in the fighting of the bubonic plague
If it were found to exist. On this com
mittee were President F. W. Dohrmann,
Secretary Freud and Messrs. Davis, Mit
chell, Bradford and Sherwood.
After a lengthy talk with the Mayor and
the Supervisors it was decided that the
Merchants' Association should select a
physician to assist in the bacteriological
analyses of the infected blood and glands
of the Chinese. A report will be made to
day at 10 o'clock to the association and
further steps will be taken aÂ» this time If
necessary.
HIGHBINDERS UNMOLESTED.
Chinese Merchants Object to Dong 1
Gong as Police Interpreter.
"With every policeman out of China
town the highbinders were at liberty to
wield their weapons with impunity yes
terday. They had not taken advantage of
the situation, however, up to an early
hour this morning, but still the. air is
laden with bloody rumors and the pop of
guns is likely to be heard at any moment.
The solution of the enigma why the high
binders, left unmolested to ply their craft,
did not strew the streets of the quaran
tined section with corpses yesterday may
resj in the fact that a great number of
the murderous element have been hiding
without the limits of Chinatown, not able
to return after the blockade.
A little stir was caused in Chinatown
yesterday morning when it was found
that policemen guarded the streets." Many
of the- tong men believed that the action
had been taken on account of tong trouble
and they laid the responsibility of the
step at the door of Dong Gong, official in
terpreter and adviser of the police, and
at the same time a prominent man in the
Sin Suey Ying Tong and the person who.
it is alleged, caused the recent outbreak.
The merchants of Chinatown are pre
paring to take some steps which will re
sult in the removal of Dong Gong from
a position with the police which no has
held since Crowley was at the head of thÂ©
department. They claim that Gong is
using the police merely as a vehicle for
his own personal likes and dislikes, and
but for him the trouble, would soon die
out of its own accord. â¢
When negotiations were on between the
Wai Ting Tong and the Sin Suey Ylngs on
one side and the Suey Sing Tons on the
other, over the insulting of a \V ai Ting
woman by a Suey Sing man, Dong Gong
was conspicuous at the conference. The
Suey Sings were willing to make any res
titution for the misconduct of their man
and promptly expelled him, as was re
quested. They also consented to post a
circular setting forth the causes for such
action, but Dong Gong insisted that the
cause be given as highway robbery, a
false charge, and one to which the Suey
i Sings would not consent.
On the night of the conference and after
the war had been declared Dong Gong
misled Sergeant Shea of the Chinatown
squad by telling him that the trouble had
been amicably settled and that no appre
hension need be felt. Shea believed his
Interpreter and went home. He had gone
but half an hour when one of Gong's so
ciety men shot and killed a Suey Sing
1 man.
The merchants, will further claim that
Dong Gong has abused his position of
bond inspector for the police and has
showed discrimination in the acceptance
of certain ball. On the whole they wl'l
complain that a man affiliated with a tonic
at war is scarcely the proper person to
direct police operations in cases where his
tong is concerned. Â¦ It is also stated that
the interpreter has been used as a leak
by his tong. when it desired to gain In
formation of police operations.
Consul General Ho Vow stated yester
day that the trouble had not been settled
vet. He thinks that there will be a tem
porary lull in the hostilities and that un
less something unforeseen intervenes the
war will soon be resumed with much
fierceness. Three of his men were work
ing in Chinatown recently trying to bring
about a settlement, but they have as yet
failed to accomplish any satisfactory re
sults... Â¦ . Â¦ - " -

Â¦ Wrestler Max \\ i]ey, who flies the col
ors of the Rochester Athletic Club, tiÂ«!s
fair to tqual at the Olympic Club tour
nament his recent performance at the an
nual' championship meeting in New I'ork.
He took part ia three preliminary bouts
in the Olympic Club last night and won
them all. He first appmred against J.
W. Rhodes in his natural class,. that for,
ios-pound men. He secured the decision
over Rhodes at the expiration of six min
utes on the mat. Referee Eugene Van
Court awarding him the honor for his
aggressiveness. He met R. S. Wixon in
the welter-weight class, 145 pounds, and
(irepÂ«ed his shou'ders squarely on the mat
after four minutes and thirty-six seconds
cf jtetive work. His third and last op
ponent was William Noethig. whom Jie
also defeated on aggressiveness, the bout
going the full f!x minutes.
Wiley's three companions, also fresh
from triumphs in Eastern arenas, won
their bouts hantfilr. J. F. Renzlar.d, 115
rounds, and Wi'.liam Nelson, 105 pounds,
each gave away weight, entering the 12.">
piund class. Renzlarid won in one min
ute and twelve sc-eonds. while Nc-lsoii took
the limit. Kurzrran. the last of the East
ern contingent, won in the fastest time
of the night, one minute and ten seconds.
The bouts proved a. surprise and a de
light to the spectators, as they went off
Â¦without a hitch, the long programme be
ing completed btfore 10 o'clock. The vis
itors all showed their wide experience In
the game and were alert to take advan
tage of every point. They learned quickly
that the Californians were not accus
tomed to an elevated platform, all the
Â¦wrestling ever donÂ«? here being on a mat
Kpread on the floor. As there was on
chance to fall off the floor if wrestled off
the mat the men did not have to give their
attention to caving themselves. Th-j
Easterners are accustomed to the elevat
ed ring, and at the commencement of each
bout rushr-d their opponents to the ropes
and did their best to disconcert .them*. In
this they were successful in a number of
instances.
The first bout of the night was between
Renzland and L. T. Chalker of the Olym
pic Club. Renzland went to work with a
rush and tried several holds. Chalker was
always on the defensive, but finally suc
cumbed to a crotch and half Nelson after
one minute and forty-two seconds work.
Prntony of the Olympi.c Club next met
l^elson. The order of aggressiveness was
reversed in this instance. Pentony bein^
the aggressor. He bustled the Easterner
about and had him in difficulty once. Pen
tony . tric-d a half Nelson and arm hold
twice, but his opponent broke it each
time. Nelson then assumed the aggressive
and nearly secured a flying fall. He then
tried a half Nelson and crotch hold, but
P^ntony broke it. His next essay was a
pretense of trying a hammer-lock, in the
hope that Pen tony would lea\-e an open
ing for a Nelson. This did not work, and
the bout went the limit. Nelson gettinir
the decision.
August Kuraman and H. Hanstein
proved exceptionally clever,- ' but ' the
former showed the advantage of Eastern
competition. Hansteln was aggressive,
trying flrst a threo-quarter Nelson. Kurz
man was loudly applauded for a head spin
and roll which took him out of da:igÂ°r.
<juick as a flash- he caught Hanstein off
his guard and floored him. Time of bout,
one minute and ten seconds.
Wiley took the full six minutes to win
from Rhodes of Oakland. He was exceed
ingly rough and had Rhodes over tnÂ»
ropes and off the mat the major part of
the time. Ho tried for a hammer held
repeatedly, but without success. Wiley
won on aggressiveness, the bout going the
limit.
C. E. Wilson threw C. E. Cutter i:Â» a
flying fall in two minutes and twenty sec
onds. He flrst raised him in the air wlfi
a catch and arm lock, which he suddenly
changed to a half Kelson.
Davis threw Pray after five minutes and
forty-eight seconds' fast work. Davis
was the aggressor, but Pray withstood
severe pressure until the last, being in
jeopardy several times.
Wiley was more successful in his second
essay, "throwing R. S. Wixon in 4 minutes
3Â»" seconds. Wixon was clever and saved
himself twice with head spins. He finally
went down under a half hammer, which
was first changed to a half Nelson and
then to an arm and half Kelson, under the
pressure of which Wixon succumbed.
Gua Klotz of the Stadum Athletic Club
\va? thrown in 2 minutes 35 seconds; by J.
11. Bpiro. The latter raieed him with a
crotch hold and right arm and then
Jr>ippe<l him.
Wiley won in the 145-pound class from
William Xoothig again on aggressiveness.
F. B. Bayly won after his bout with
Dan Mahoney had gone the limit.
There l^ing only two contestants in the
heavy-weight class, a. Hiltlebrand and C.
Plerson. their bout decided the champion
ship in that class. Lioth were as burly
as piano movers, but did not have much
science. They wrestled two hours of flx
minutes tacli and one of three minutes
without-a fall. Pierson. the Oakland man,
was then awarded the championship for
his aj?sres=siveness.
There are thirteen boxing bouts on the
card for to-night. The names of the men
who will appear are given herewith. They
arp segregated into thf>ir respective
classes, but will not knew whom they are
to me^t until they draw for opponents,
just before they ent-jr the ring. There

home with the money, starting favorites
in the ring. Â¦
A very, warm tip. permeated the. atrro*
phere on Dreadnaught, sending the Ar
tillery horse, to the post favorite for the
opening event. The price was perhaps a
disappointment, for the good thing fin
ished fifth. Leipzig, a 5 to 1 chance, never
further back than second, won easily at
the end from, Hiram Johnson, a 20 to 1
outsider. Garbo ran third. Â¦
Spencer landed the mile selling run with
Durward, The ring laid 4% to 1 against
the jumper, and after alternating in mak
ing the pace with Almoner, he beat tl)e
latter horse cleverly by a length. Tellnc
the 6 to 5 favorite, could never get to the
front, finishing third. 'â¢Â¦â¢â¢"
; Burns Â¦& Waterhouse sent Bernota, a
youngster by Take Notice, to the post for
the first time in the two-year-old das.ii,
and he showed to be quite a spry one.
Breaking first; the novice dropped to third
position, then finishing gamely." led Sub
lime out a /length. - Screenwell Lake; :
backed from 20 to 8, ran third. The win
ner was at one time 7 to 1 in the betting.
With Spencer on his" back, Topmast, a
slight favorite over Cormorant for the
mile 'and a sixteenth run, turned up; an
easy winner. Cormorant made the run
ning for a portion of the route, after
which ho began to stop, losing the place
to Morinel. .
Peace, the 8 to 5 choice for the fifth
event, a six-furlong spin, broke away to
a flying start, and was never collared.
Thorpe rode Novla most vigorously, but
could do no better than finish second,
five lengths ahead of Clarando.
The final milo selling run simmered
down to a drive between Grand Sachem
and the favorite. Charles Le Bel. The
first-named horse proved gamest, getting
the decision by half a length.

â¢
Curtis & Son's gTeyhound Commodore
and A. Johnson's Mountain Beauty met Jn
the deciding course at Union Park yester
day after an eventful day's sport. At the
first attempt they ran up an even score
each, making six points In a course which
took them clear across the field, the hare
being killed just at the escape. They
seemed equally matched in speed, running
stride for stride. Commodore then drew
out. only to be passed later on by his
opponent. Judge Grace sent them back
to the slips. Commodore seemed the less
distressed, and where Mountain Beauty
was favorite before the course at odds
of 2^ to 1, the betting went to even
money. Commodore Justified the confi
dence of the bettors, winning by a score
or S to 1. He led across the field* and
after scoring his points, seemed to have
enough of the running. Mountain Beauty
then took possession and ran the hare
twice across the field. She was so far
behind, however, that she scored only one
point. The hare went through the escape
forty yards ahead of the leading doÂ»;.-

the morning, but In the afternoon they de-

THOMPSON IS THE MAN.
Bio Grande Western Management
Names Its Isocal Passeng-er
Agent.
Fred W. Thompson has been appointed
general agent of the passenger depart
ment of the Rio Grande Wesiern in this
city. Mr. Thompson has been for some
time .agent of the Rock Island read at
Los Angeles and has '.yon for himself
an enviable reputation among* his fel
low railroad men.
The Rio Grande apency was formerly
under the control of W. H. ; Snedaker,
who looked after both the nassengef and
freight business. When Mr. ' Snedaker
severed his connection with that road to
take charge of the San Francisco agency
of the, Illinois Central it was decided to
divide the Rio Grande agency into two
departments. â¢
Mr. Thompson's appointment becomes
effective on the ICth of this month. No
intimation has as yet been given as to
the man who will look after the freight
end of the business.

SACRAMENTO
POOL-SELLER IS
UNDER ARREST
Charged With Open Viola
tion of the New
Ordinance.
Chief Sullivan Has Secured the Names
of a Number of Prominent Citi
zens Who \7ill Be Called
:.* as Witnesses.
â¢â
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 7.â The question
whether the pool-sellers can outrage the
moral sense of the community will ' be
tested in the courts., Frank Daroux, the
most defiant of the gambling fraternity,
was arrested this afternoon for selling
pools; contrary to' the provision " of the
ordinance recently enacted as a result of
one of the most vigorous public crusades
ever waged In Sacramento. Daroux gave
bonds for his appearance In court with
B. W. Cavanaugh and George Davidson as
sureties. Chief of Police Sullivan assured
The Call correspondent this evening that
he had secured ample evidence on which
to effect the conviction of- Daroux. It is
understood that the Chief has obtained
the names of a number of citizens, more
or less prominent, who will either have
to swear that they had Â¦ dealings with
Daioux in violation of the ordinance or
place themselves In a position rendering
them liable to Impeachment. ; . '. .
However this may be. Chief Sullivan
will continue to take down the name of
every person who enters the poolroom and
attempts to violate the law. The stories
of lives wrecked In San Francisco from
the poolrooms there, as narrated within
the past week in The Call, have had their
counterpart in numerous instances here,
not the least shocking of which was that
where a promising young man from the
country attending a school here was ren
dered insane because of the poolroom
habit.
The principal of the high school has de
clared on the public platform his belief
that boys in. his charge were being cor
rupted by the vire, and an instance is
known where a once prosperous young
business man was obliged to mortgage his
home for all It was worth in order to meet
shortages consequent upon the allurement
of the poolrooms. The passage of the
anti-poolroom ordinance against tremen
dous pressure on the other side was too
hard a battle to put the public in a mood
to overlook violations of the law, and
Mayor Clark and Chief Sullivan have the
backing of the respectable, element in
their onslaught on the vice.
With rare effrontery Daroux has opened
up a poolroom in Washington, Yolo Coun
ty, directly opposite Sacramento, despite
the signed protests of the residents of the
village. He has established a branch at
Sixth and J streets,- this city, and there
the horses and prices are posted. Bets
are made .there In whiSpers in a secret
apartment, .but while the business has
been going on since last Saturday Daroux
has not been astute enough to escape the
vigilance of Chief Sullivan, and those who
have had dealings with him must suffer
the shame of being called into court to
reveal the nature of their transactions.

WHEELS OF JUSTICE
COMPLETELY CLOGGED
Felony Cases .in the .Police Courts
Cannot Be Heard for -Lack of
.'._;â¢ Stenographers.
The wheels of justice are completely
clogged In Judge Mogan's court owing to
the lack of stenographers. The case of
L. R. Hare, charged with felony embez
zlement by Dr. St. D. Gvnlais Walters,
had been peremptorily set for yesterday
morning,- and there were five other felony
cases on the calendar. The Judge said
he would have to continue them, as the
Hare case would take over a week, and
the attorneys raised a howl of protest.
Attorney Stafford offered to pay for a
stenographer if a case in which he was
interested was transferred to another
court, and Judge Fritz consenting, it was
transferred to his court. The other at
torneys objected to being mulcted in the
cost of a stenographer, and. accompanied
by the Judge, they called at the Mayor's
office to lay the matter before him, but
he could not be found. Another attempt
will be made to-day to see him.

Coroner Cole received the foregoing let
ter yesterday morning. The writer, had
not placed a stamp upon it and tlie en
velope was marked, "Postage duo. 2
cents." The Coroner had hardly finished
reading the letter when a telephone mes
sage came In announcing that Henry V.
Morey was lying dead in his bed in room
30 at 605 Broadway, and a half empty bot
tle of carbolic acid was on the table near
the head of the bed.
Morey was a waiter by occupation, and
until recently had worked as an elevator
attendant. He lost his position and failed
to secure another. One by one he pawned
all the spare articles of his wardrobe, and
then having no money left, except suffi
cient to buy a vial of the cheap poison, he
wrote the letter to the Coroner and killed
himself.
The inmates of the cheap lodging-house
In which he had resided for a long time
noticed that the old man had been grow
ing more and- more despondent, but as
they were Impecunious themselves, all
they could offer him was their sympathy,
which, though sincere, was not sufficiently
substantial to afford him any relief.
CAPE NOME
TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES.
NATIONAL CLUB MAKES
TWO MORE GOOD MATCHES
Heavy-Weight Lawler to Meet Win
ner of Stelzner-Butler Fight.
"Parson" Bean to Battle
With Green.
Manager Gibbs of the National Ath
letic Club has recovered from the shabby
treatment accorded him by "Paddy"
Purtell and is busily engaged securing
talent for boxing shows to be given un
der the auspices of his club. Last night
he matched Charles Lawler, an Eastern
heavy-weight, to meet the winner of the
Stelzner-Butler contest, and he also se
cured the signatures of "Soldier" Phil
Green and Willard Bean to an agreement
to fight twenty rounds as a preliminary
to the main contest. Both contests will
be held on the evening of March 30 at
Woodward's Pavilion, and, if judgment
can be based on the past performances of
the men, some great sport will be seen.
Lawler is -highly recommended by
"Billy" Delaney, the famous trainer. De
laney has *een Lawler perform in the
ring and in private ana has a high
opinion of his ability to inflict as well as
to withstand punlsnment. The Eastern
heavy-weight arrived here a week ago
in search of a match, and his credentials
were so good that the National Club
management decided to pit him against
either Stelzner or Butler. Lawler stands
over six feet high, has a heavy frame and
the appearance of a man who can handle
himself well in the ring.
The bout between Green and Bean will
arouse great interest in pugilistic circles,
and is therefore an excellent preliminary.
Green has met and defeated some clever
middle-weights during the past year and
has shown in his contests that he is a
man who can give and take a beating.
Bean, who is better known as the "Par
son," because of his eloquent discourses
on Christianity in the streets of various
cities, has met such men as Joe Choynskl,
"Paddy" Purtell. Jim Williams of Utah,
Jack Douglas and other well known
"scrappers," but has never had a decision
go apainst hfm. He is an exponent of
physical culture, and although he looks
meek and harmless in street attire, when
stripped to the buff he discloses muscles
that would be the envy of strong men.
He broke both "mitts" when he fought a
twenty-round draw with Purtell, but they
are in good enough condition now to bat
ter a door down. He has been a teacher
of boxing, lecturer, preacher, elocutionist
and actor, but he relies on his ability to
battle with his fists to gain a livelihood.
Joe Butler, tho Philadelphia heavy
weight, is training hard at Blanken's Six
Mile House for his battle with Jack Stelz
ner. which Is to be fought before the Na
tional Athletic Club on the 14th lnst. He
Is in splendid fettle and feels confident
that he can defeat the local man. He has
Improved materially since his last visit
to this city, when he defeated Frank
Slavin In short order. "Crockey" Boyle,
the lightweight, who Is to meet Harrera,
the clever Southern California boxer. Is
also training at the same place. Stelzner
is preparing for his contest at the end
of Haight street, and la reported to be
ready to enter the ring at a minute's
notice.
The Reliance Club of Oakland will hold
a boxing show night. A fine programme
has been arranged consisting of two try
outs for preliminaries, a battle royal be
tween fix colored men, and two ten-round
contests for decisions. The. main events
will be between Charles Johnson of San
Francisco and William Martin of Los
Angeles at 135 pounds, ringside, and
Jack McMahon and George Simpson at
137 pounds. x- r . .-Â¦;Â¦;.Â¦â¢â¢â
NEW DEPARTURE
AT THE GRAND
THE Grand Opera-house company
has taken yet another tack. This
time it is musical farce and it turns
out to be a very brisk and enjoy
able show.
There is not much to "The Girl From
Paris" besides a very broad German dia
lect part, but It was one of the fad hits
in New York and. ran an unconscionably
long time at the Herald-Square Theater.
In the original cast Louis Mann made
an extraordinary hit on entirely new lines
Â¦and drew an excruciatingly funny, charac
ter In the part of Hans that was abso
lutely fresh to the stage. Except for this
single feature there is nothing memorable
about "The Girl From Paris." and 1 even
found myself forgetting the fact that it
had musical attachments. In point of fact
the music is insignificant and the merit ot
the performance must rest with the action
and comedy. Â¦
Tiie Morosco people. do very well indeed
when it Is remembered that they are
comic opera specialists, and there is
enough g? to at least two of the parts to
make the performance move along very
pleasantly.
Edith Mason does not make an exactly
sparkling French girl, but she contrives
to Imitate her Insinuating wiles with a
sort of mock abandon that might in spots
be taken for the real thing.
A positively chilling sobriety overtakes
her, however, when she Is not busy with
her lines and the same is true of Persse.
who as the explosive major (an imita
tion," by the way, of the New York pat
tern which was itself an Imitation of the
major in "The Gaiety Girl"), utters his
lines between fits of frigidity that take
somewhat from an otherwise clever char-
There is always the need of by-play in
these frivolous jlm-crack comedies, for
they have not enough sound humor to
them to admit a pause in the action. The
stretches of soliloquy by Mr. Wooley in
particular turn the whole thing toward
dullness, and when he comes pn the stage
one immediately begins to be bored.
Edwin Hanford, in an extravagant
French caricature, is capably comic and
carries out his part with more consistency
than any one el?e in the cast. Wolff shows
some mettle in the grotesque part of Hans
the inn-keeper, and his conscientious work
bears good results. The part of Amos
Dingle, which had a value in the original
production, was thrown away on Nace
Honvil'.e, and the presentation of Ruth,
the servant, which was given an interest
in New York that was the talk of the
town, was limited by the modest ability
of Miss Matilda Watt, who is evidently a
beginner. PORTER GARNETT.

e=y=3 HE Old Homestead" will continue
Â¦ at the Columbia for four nights
.- ][Â¦ (Including Sunday) and Saturday
matinee. Next week the New York
success, "Because She Loved Him So,"
will be produced with the original cast,
including J. E. Dodson, Annie Irish, Kate

which is a recommendation In itself.
"Darkest Russia" will finish the week
at the California. Next week "The
Brownies in Fairyland" will be presented
on Thursday night, March 15.
"Never Again" is easily worth the two
week run which It will be given at the
Alcazar. "Diplomacy" is in preparation.
"The Girl From Paris" continues to
draw at the Grand Opera-house, and in
consequence will be continued all next
week.
The -Tivoll -will continue Its production
of "The Idol's Eye" indefinitely. Its
drawing power seems to be on the In
crease.
The Orpheum has an unusually strong
bill, headed by the Smedley Sketch Club,
a company of clever children, and the
troupe of Arabian gymnasts.
This afternoon the second of the series
of the Wagnerian concerts will take olaco
at the California Theater. "The Flying
Dutchman" Is to be the theme. To-nior
row a double bill of "Lohengrin" and "Die
Meistersinger" will be given. Mme. Of-d

will be heard in three concerts next week.
The dates and programmes are as follows:
Monday, "Das Rhelngold" and "Die
Walkure"; Tuesday, "Siegfried" and
"Goiterdammerung"; Wednesday a mis
cellaneous concert, of which the pro
gramme is to be announced later.
Mr. Damrosch's lecture recitals arc ex

forded so much pleasure last year, will
be glad to learn that their leading tenor.
Sig. Badaracco. has returned and will be
heard in concert at Sherman, Clay & Co.'i
Hall on Friday night. Signoras Barduoci
and Pollettini and Signor Wanrell are on
the programme. . ...y
A Wonderful Exhibition.
Norris & Rowe's big trained animal
shows entertained two large audiences
yesterday at the Mechanics' Pavilion. If
one could believe In the marvelous stones
told In Arabian Nights of how Princes
and Princesses were, by some magical en
chantment, turned into ponies and other
animals. It would be easy to understand
the almost human intelligence with which
the animals of Norris & Rowe's shows
are gifted.. A believer In these remark
able tales could readily understand how
Snowflake had been a warrior bold of
noble birth, transformed ' by some evil
genie into this smart little pony. The
imagination in this channel, could trace
another life for each of the beautiful ani
mals with this wonderful show. The per
formance can be viewed as another Illus
tration of the power given to man at the
creation over inferior but hardly less lov
able animals. The show is a meritorious
one. and every boy and girl should see it.
Performances will be given dally at 2:30
and 8 p. m. throughout the engagement,
which "runs .until March 18.
WHEELER SAYS TRACK
TEAM MUST GO EAST
Enthusiastic Meeting to Discuss the
Project Is Held in Hearst ~
Hall.
BERKELET, March 7.â President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the university has
declared that the track team must go
East to compete with the Eastern col
leges, and since the president has taken
such a deep interest in the matter it Is
certain to go through. President Wheeler
made his positive declaration In favor of
the project at the students' rally at
Hearst Hall this evening.
The rally had been called for the pur
pose of raising enthusiasm and money,
and President Wheeler was invited to be
present. The meeting was presided over

track team. There were yells and music
and then a lot of five-minutes speeches.
tverett Brown, who has done more for
student athletics than almost any man
ager that the university ever had; C. E.
ililler, a member of the students' athletic
committee; Fred Dorety. president of the
Associated Students; Ezra Decoto, present
track manager; William Drumm. the fa
mous sprinter; John R. Glascock. ot the
alumni; Arthur North and President
\\ heeler were the speakers.
"The track team must go East," said
President Wheeler, and then the yells and
cheers were deafening. "I want the West
to show the East how to do track ath
letics," continued the president. "I want
you to show the East that we are civilized
out here, and this is one of the best ways
to do it. From what I can hear we have
the best track team that the University
of California has ever nad. and I say the
team must go East." Manager Ezra De
coto explained the financial situationâ how
it was expected that $4500 would be neces
sary for the trip, of which $1500 would
comÂ©, from gate receipt*, $1500 from the
aiumnl and an equal amount from the
undergraduates. William Drumm said
that the university had a better track
team than it had in 1595, when the first
team went East and made such a good
impression. He declared that the present

After the horse has decided that life is
safe within a reasonable radius of the

Overdue Schooner Sophie
Sutherland Reaches Port
After Rough Voyage.
â ? â
Mail Steamers Sailâ The Missionary
Barkentine Morning Star Arrives
Prom Carolines â Sealers
Doing Well.
The British rhfp Clan Galbraith and the
schooner Sophie Sutherland came In over
tne bar in company together yesterday.
The voyages of the two vessels were as
erectly opposite In character as could
we.l be imagined. The Clan Galbroith
made a very- fast run of fifty live dc-ys
-rom Newcastle. N. S. \\\. while the So
phie Sutherland was seventy days coming
T â¢ m E1 Triumf o. in Central America. The
snip had a fair weather passage through
out, while the schooner lost her deck load
and had to up-helm and run before the
gale in order, to keep ircm going down,
i.-c Oa.oraith comes into port in fir E
tc.ass order, while the Sutherland Is leak
ing and will have to go on the dry dock
for repairs.
The Sophie Sutherland left El Trtumfo
on December 'Si last, and for over a month
nothing but light and baffling winds were
met with. On February 6 a very heavy
gale was encountered. The schooner was
thrown on her beams end. and 120 cedar
logs that formed her deck load *vere
washed away. The vessel was finally go*
before the win-J and an examination was
made by Captain Schroder. He found f.ve
feet of water in the hold, the stores near
ly all destroyed, the salt water mixed
with the frcsli water and other damage
done. For five days the Sophie Sutherland
ran before the f,ale. and by that tlmf th"
water had been pumped out of the hold
â¢nd the vessel was once more manageabi*-.
The schooner was so long oven Vie that
20 per cent reinsurance was paid on her
by pome of the owners.
Z he missionary barkentine Morning Star
arrived from the Carolines yesterday after
a fair run of forty-three days. The voy
epe was uneventful and the captain re
ports everything quiet at Kusale and Rule.
The Morning Star will lie up for a month
or so. and will be thoroughly overhauled
and mad* ready .for another South Sea
Island cruise.
The mail steamer Australia sailed for

CHINATOWN QUARANTINED.
police authorities should be mindful of the
effects of a groundless scare about bubonic
plague in Chinatown. Science leaves no uncer
tainty possible. The bubonic microbe has been iso
lated and identified, until H Â»s as easily recognized as
Mount Tamalpais. Our local sanitary i authorities,
acting with the Federal quarantine officers, ought to
be able at once to settle the cause of the "suspicious
death" of the Chinese which caused the quarantining
of the whole Chinese quarter. This should be done
promptly and there should not be here the needless
repetition of the scenes in Honolulu, where science
abdicated control to reasonless fear.
Burning buildings and destruction of property will
not stop the plague if it be present. It was very active
in the Chinese quarter of Hongkong a few years ago,
and the microbe was identified by the Japanese bac
teriologist, Kittisato, and the pestilence was stopped
in ten days by drenching the whole quarter, streets,
houses and all, in a solution of caustic lime. We are
sure that the highly intelligent Chinese Consul. Mr.
Ho Vow, and the Six Companies, will readily co
operate in such a cleansing of our Chinatown, plague
or no plague, and it should be had any way.
This peculiar Asiatic pestilence may be expected to
make a sporadic appearance in every country that is
in commercial communication with the Orient, es
pecially where an Asiatic population is domesticated
under such circumstances as to propagate it. There
are diseases that appear in all crowded populations,
which seem to serve nature's quite benevolent pur
pose of keeping the population down to the food sup
ply. When these diseases appear they prove to be
largely racial, as this plague is, and experience with
it proves that Occidental races are but little subject to
it. They have their own racial diseases to admonisri
them that they are mortal and must not crowd to
gether too closely. Consumption and typhoid,
diphtheria and scarlet fever, are constantly present
among them, performing the same office that the
plague does among the Asiatics,
Care should be taken here not to make use of a
groundless plague panic to effect purposes in China
town that lie far away from its sanitary condition.
San Francisco does not care to turn trade away and
scare the whole country to a diversion of commerce
and travel for a cause that may have no existence, or
that, if it exist, can be quickly identified and removed.
Precautions are always praiseworthy, and no one finds
fault with their promptness, but certainty is requisite
and should be speedily reached.
It is the testimony of science and experience that
in climates like ours, if indeed there be any other as
excellent, the immunity of others than Asiatics is
perfect. Surely "the immunity from plague enjoyed
by Europeans in China, India and Hawaii becomes
no less when they are in their own racial climate.
Therefore no apprehension need be felt by our non-
Afiatic population, if the suspicions raised by the re
ported death of an Asiatic here should prove to be
well founded. We are sure that our public authori
ties will be impressed by the general demand that they
act with promptness, discretion and scientific accu
racy, to the end that the first alarms of a suddenly
developed situation be not suffered to rise to a feel
ing of panic.

MR. KASSON'S TREATIES
/^COMMISSIONER. KASSON, according to re
( ports from Washington, is busily engaged in
'making preliminary studies for a reciprocity
treaty with Italy, and expects to begin negotiating
for such a treaty within a short time. As that coun
try is a producer and an exporter of fruits and wines
and other articles which come into competition with
the products of California, it is likely we shall have
another fight to make for self-protection when the
Commissioner gets through with his work.
Under these circumstances it is gratifying to learn
there is but little chance that the Kasson treaties with
France and with Jamaica will be ratified. It seems to
be now conceded that the opposition to the treaties is
sufficiently strong to defeat them. That opposition
comes not alone from California, but from all parts
of the Union. Even the manufacturers whose inter
ests are not directly threatened by the arrangements
of the treaties have in many instances declared against
them on the ground that they would afford precedents
for breaking down the protective policy of the coun
try, and would lead sooner or later to other treaties
in which manufacturing industries would suffer.:
Mr. Kasson has defended his French treaty by
arguing that we make concessions on only 126 num
bers out of .the 705 of the tariff/ while the French
make concessions on all but 10 of the 654 in their
tariff. He further claims that otir ; cpncessions amount
to less than a' 7 per cent reduction from the tan!?
rates, while the F/ench amount to an average reduc- v
Some of the stories of the effects of the blizzard in
Chicago are as thrilling as a dime novel. In several
cases the cars on the elevated roads were stopped and
the passengers had to get out and walk over the
s!eet-covered ties, with the consciousness that if by
any slip they came into contact with the third rail
they wouid be killed instantly. As a midnight
promenade such a walk could hardly be beaten in the
most adventurous parts of the globe.
It is worth noting that in the whole course of the
fight in New York against Olga Nethersole and
"Sapho" neither Dr. Parkhurst nor Anthony Corn
stock took any part. There seems to be a new era
in New York all round and the old reformers have
been crowded out.
Masc?.gni's dedication of his new opera to "Myself,
with distinguished esteem and unalterable satisfac
tion," affords perhaps the only instance on record
where the recipient of a complimentary dedication
reciprocated the feelings expressed by the author.
Eastern reports are to the effect that Paderewski

THE ORANGE SUPPLY.
SEVERE frosts in Florida during the winter have
given rise to fears that the orange crop of the
State will fail this season and that the supply
in the Eastern market will fall far short of the de
mand. On that subject the Cincinnati Commercial
Tribune published recently a short but instructive edi
torial for the benefit of its, readers, reminding them
that the United States is no longer dependent for
oranges upon Florida, but has a source of supply in
California.
After reviewing the history of the cultivation of
oranges in this State, the Commercial Tribune says:
"Only a few years ago a California orange was any
thing but pleasant to the taste, and the prediction was
general that it would be * impossible to produce
palatable oranges on the Pacific Coast. The fruit was
coarse grained and acrid to the taste. The growers
were not discouraged, however, and after years of
trial they have succeeded in producing an orange as
fine grained and palatable as any grown in Florida.
From a commercial point of view the test has proven
a success, and this is a legitimate criterion. In 1898
it is estimated that about 8000 carloads of the fruit
were sent East from California, and in 1899 about 9000
carloads.. This year the shipments will be 14.500 car
leads and will sell for $4,600,000, of which sum about
half will go to the growers."
. In the meantime the Floridians are speculating as
to the future of orange-growing in' their State. The
Florida Times Union advocates the cultivation of
small groves under protection of some. kind. It says:
"Let , the horticulturist mightily enrich and cultivate
one acre, two acres, or three acres, according to his
cloth; reef it up snug and taut as a ship made ready
for a gale: then it will pay him to protect it, ; any
where in the old; orange belt where geology and to
pography have set up a fingerboard. Trim the; trees
up like a Cromwellian Roundhead, low and solid tops,
like the Dutchman's horse, 'low down and wide out,'
trees from which a man can stand with" his .boot
heels on the ground and pick six boxes. Oranges
grown undercover, unvexed by West Indian gales,
unpricked by thorns, juicy with a conserved moisture,
as fine as silk, as luscious asonly Florida can pro
duceâevery box knocking a big hole in a Northern
$10. bill."
That 13 perhaps as good a suggestion as can â¢be
made for Florida, but in the meantime the orange in
dustry of California, carried on in the open airland
free from. danger, of-frosts, is rapidly increasing its
output, and perhaps the;time is not far distant .when
Floridians will be i saved j: the trouble of ; - growing
oranges, as they can get all they wish from .California.

GOLDEN AGES OF LITERATURE.
RARELY, even at any of the greatest universities
of the world, have students been afforded a bet
ter opportunity to study the whole course of
the literature of the nations, .under able instructors,
than that given to the readers of The Call in the
series of articles on "The Golden Ages of Literature,"
now running as a part of the spring course of home
studies.
The design of the series is to take in the whole
sweep of literature, sacred and profane, from the days
of hieroglyphic writing in old Egypt down to our
own time and our own country. The contributors to
the course include Dr. Edward Everett Hale of Bos
ton, Dr. Parrott of Princeton, Professor Palmer of
Yale. Professor More of Harvard, Professor Smith
of the University of Wisconsin, Miss Vida D. Scud
der of Wellesley, and a number of others hardly less
eminent.
Thus far the course has been carried down to the
days of Homer and the Greek epics, so that it has
hardly more than begun. The series as a whole is to
ir.clude thirty-six studies, covering the literature of
Egypt, Assyria, Persia. China, Judea, Greece, Rome,
Italy, England. France, Germany and the United
States. In addition to the comprehensive summary
given by the writers of each paper of the literature
of the age with which the paper deals, there is added
a list of works which students who desire fuller infor
mation can profitably study. In fact, the course con
stitutes a guide of real value to the wonderful story of
the literature of all nations and all ages, and merits
the attention of all who are interested in literary
topics.

NICARAGUA AND COSTA RICA
war fog between the two Central American
rejmblics seems to be for the time dissipated.
It threatened to interfere with the canal project
md cloud international relations with strife and con
lention. It had its origin in- a very old feud in
Nicaragua. One of the early Presidents of that repub
ic was Senor Mora. He had the genius of a states
man and the constructive faculty of a state-builder.
He has had many successors who were not up to his
level in capacity, attainments and patriotism. Among
h.is descendant?, one, Senor Frederick Mora, devel
oped a turn for public life that promised benefit to
his country and led his countrymen to look forward
:c his becoming President of the republic and renew
tng the beneficial work of his ancestor. The factions
that .-ihertiateiy set up Presidents and knocked them
rtown were not favorable to his ambitions and used
every craft and wile to break him down in the con
fidence <>f the people. All their schemes, however,
i\ere abortive and resulted in increasing rather than
iinnnishing the number of his followers. Finall}- Zc
laya and his party resorted to desperate measures.
Senor Mora was in New York, and his enemies
hatched a conspiracy to involve him in infamy. He
Â»-as charged with counterfeiting the money of Nica
r.-'.pua in New York. Our statutes cognize that of
:t-i]>c. and the men who had charged him with it were
not lacking in testimony to fasten it upon him. He
impoverished himself in a vain defense, was found
guilty and sentenced for a term of years to Sing Sing
penitentiary. After that it was easy to prevent his
pardon through diplomatic representation to our Gov
ernment, and he served his full term. At its expira
tion he found means to return to Central America,
and all there was of the recent war scare was the fact
of his presence in Costa Rica. Zelaya expected re
prisal in any way that Mora could master, and con
sidered the presence of his victim in Costa Rica as
equivalent to a declaration of war. If we don't next
hear of Mora's assassination we may yet hear of a
movement organized around hi? name and the high
reputation of his family which will at once avenge the
\vro:igs he suffered and work changes in the politics
of Nicaragua. While building the canal is pending
the United States have the. keenest interest in all that
* fleets the internal politics of Nicaragua, and it will
be well to keep an eye on the movements of Mora,
for he is sure to be the storm center of the isthmus
for Â«>omr time to come.
been continually held responsible for con
ditions entirely beyond her control, and
if the approach of the new century fif's
her in rebellion it need occasion no sur
prise. The stronger and more philosophi
cal among women are willing 'still to bear
the responsibility, but they demand the
power which rightfully should go with it.
The weaker and more reckless women are
inclined to get rid of it entirely.
But let this be remembered in this tajk
about divorces, that the vast majority are
obtained by wives because of the short
comings of husbands, and not by meu bf
cause women have failed in their obliga
tions. The statutes under which these
are secured are framed wholly by men. In
not one had women any share; it is men
alone who stand sponsor for their val
idity and necessity,
Cardinal Gibbons says women are trying
to usurp positions for which neither God
nor Nature intended- them. We wish these
had been specified. When first they asked
for an education beyond the "three i's"
they were told that neither God nor Na
ture ever intended that woman should
understand Greek and mathematics. When
they wanted a chance to earn a living
they were warned that God and Nature
Intended woman should only cook and
sew. In fact, they never have attempted
anything outside the four, walls of home
without having this admonition held over
their heads, but they have found that
whenever they could circumvent man and
do the things they wanted to they got on
all right with God and" Nature. -
It seems very strange that. God always
should have selected man as the medium
.through, which to express his revelations
in regard to woman, and that these should
invariably correspond so closely with what
man himself wanted her to do. It was
through direct revelation that woman was
compelled to endure the . horrible degra
dation of which we read throughout the
Old Testament. Joseph Smith received s
revelation which was used to persuade
credulous women into the relations of
polygamy for fifty years. The priesthood
of both the Catholic and Protestant
churches continue to declare themselves
the mouthpieces of God to mark out the
boundaries for -women. Thus far and no
further. The masses of women may con
tinue to be coerced for several generations
longer, but the ranks, are beginning to
break. Ultimately woman will settle these
questions with her own Judgment, LÂ«r
own conscience and her. own God, with
out the services of a go-between. Free
dom of choice, liberty of action â God and
Nature never intended that these bless
ings should be granted to man and de
nied to woman.
Dr. Lyman Abbott should change the
name of the "Outlook" to "Looking Back
ward," as far as its attitude on the fran
chise for women is concerned. The noted
divine traveled all the way to Boston, the
other day, to plead with a legislative com
mittee not to report favorably a bill for
woman suffrage. The burden of his argu
ment was that the majority of women
were indifferent or opposed. Then why
did the reverend gentleman try to prevent
the Legislature from submitting a woman
suffrage amendment to the Massachusetts
voters, which would give the women an
opportunity in the campaign to show
where they stood? Every winter when
this question comes up before the Legis
lature of that State the brainiest women
of the commonwealth appear in its behalf,
and every year the opponents skirmish
around and get a man to plead for them
that the voters shall not have a chanco to
pass upon this question.
Dr. Abbott and the rest of the opponents
have been driven at last to the one objec
tion, that the majority of. women do not
Â¦want the -franchise, which they continu
ally shout from the housetops. How are
they going to prove this assertion? Hun
dreds of thousands of women have peti
tioned Congress to grant them the right
to vote, but less than a dozen have peti
tioned that body not to grant this right.
In the New York constitutional campaign
of ' 1894 over 300,000 women of that State
petitioned the convention for a suffrage
amendment, but, "although ' the "antis"
made an active canvass, only 15,000 names
of both men and women were secured in
opposition. Every State and Territory in
the Union has its suffrage organizations,
while in not half a dozen are there any
anti-suffrage organizations. In Wyom
ing, where equal suffrage has prevailed
for thirty years, the official statistics show
that a larger percentage of women vote
than of men. The same was true in Wash
ington Territory during the three years
when -women voted there. In , Colorado,
Utah and Idaho the percentage of male
and female voters is about the same. If
figures can prove anything, these ought
to prove that of the women who have de
clared themselves one way or the other
the majority certainly have Indicated that
they do want to vote and will vote when
they get a chance. .. ..
But even if this were not the case, by
what law of precedent do the opponents
of woman suffrage demand that no women
shall have the ballot until a majority ask
for it? When religious qualifications for
voting were abolished it was not done at
the request of a majority, of those who
were disfranchised. When property re
quirements were done away with and the
worklngmen were enfranchised it was not
at the demand of , a majority of these
workingmen. When the ballot wag given
to negro men it was not by the desire of a
majority n< their number. When Congress
conferred the franchise on all Indian men
who would abandon tribal relations" it did
not do so at the behest of. a majority of
the, red brethren. : Now, by what reason
ing must suffrage for women Â¦ wait until
a majority; of them actually express a deÂ»

IDA HUSTED HARPER
NE almost can imagine he sees the
fine political work of . Susan B.
I I Anthony behind that terrlnc ar
y J _ raignment of women by Cardinal
Gibbons last Sunday. It is Just
what was needed to stir them up
on the eve of the National Suffrage Con
vention. The path of the progressive
woman is made so smooth and flowery
nowadays that there is danger of paraly
sis of the fighting faculties from disuse.
It will give her self-complacency a jolt
to hear his Eminence: â¢Â¦ : ,;^
I regard woman's rights women and society
leaders as the worst enemies of the female Bex.
They rob women of all that Is amiable and
gentle, tender and attractive, and give her
nothing in return but masculine boldnesa and
brazen effrontery.
They are habitually preaching about woman's
rights and prerogatives and nave not a word to
Bay about her duties and responsibilities. They
withdraw her from those sacred obligations
which properly belong to her sex and 1111 her
with ambition to -usurp a position for which
neither God nor nature ever intended her.
Under the influence of such teachers we find
woman, especially in the higher circles, neglect-
Ing the household duties, gadding about, never
at peace unless she is in perpetual motion,
never at ease unless she Is in a state of morbid
excitement :
Her aftlicted husband comes home to find it
empty or occupied by a woman whose heart Is
void of affection for him. Then arise disputes,
quarrels, recrimination, estrangements, and the
last act In- the drama Is often divorce.
f-I speak thy- sober truth when I affirm that
for the wrecks of families in our: country
woman has a lanje share of the responsibility.
There is a keen .satire in this constant
assertion by the dignataries of the Cath
olic church that the home and mother
hood are woman's sphere when there is
no other institution in the whole world
which imposes celibacy upon so many
men ana women, making homes impos
sible and motherhood out of the question.
The Cardinal has so "mixed those
babies up" that we cannot tell whether
it is the society leaders or the woman's
rights women- who have reduced the sex
to a condition of "masculine boldness and
brazen effrontery," yet the precepts and
practices of the two are as wide apart as
the poles. As -this space is consecrated to
the suffragists, I will take up the cudgels
in their behalf and let the fashion maga
zines defend their votaries. "They are
habitually preaching about woman's
rights and prerogatives and have not a
word to say about her duties and re
sponsibilities." What his Eminence
should do is to run down to Washington
to the Woman Suffrage Convention, now
in session, and hear some of the papers:
"Woman's Work in Philanthropy"; "War
and the Work of Women"; "Conditions
of the -Wage Earning Women of Our
Country" ; "New Professions for Women
Centering in the Home"; "The Duty of
Woman Citizens of the United States in
the Present Crisis." Do not these savor
very strongly Â¦of duties and responsibili
ties? The trouble with a great many peo
ple besides Cardinal Gibbons is that they
have no comprehension of what the suf
frage advocates are. striving for. Their
principal argument for the ballot is that
it will give them greater power to dis
charge what they consider their duties
and responsibilities to their homes and to
the State.
"Neglecting their household duties,
gadding about, perpetual motion, morbid
excitement" â that must be the society
women, and yet the same charge is made
against the woman's rights women, and
it- is just as true and Just as false about
one as the other. Mrs. Jellaby, the
famous prototype; of the ' Woman-Who-
Neglects-Her-Home, did it because she
was so absorbed in the heathen of dis
tant lands, and the church always has
encouraged this foreign missionary spirit.
As a matter of fact, households some
times do suffer because women give too
much time to religious duties or temper
ance work or social affairs or club life or
the advocacy of equal rights; and, on the
other hand, there are women who render
valuable services to one or more of these
pursuits and yet reserve always the best
of themselves for their homes and fami
lies. It depends entirely upon the disposi
tion of the- woman, not; upon the nature
of the object which claims her. interest.
'. The general assertion may be made that
homes were- never so beautiful, bo well
appointed,* bo perfectly managed as they
are--, to-day. . The. modern woman could
give her grandmother a -world of infor
mation on- sanitary "plumbing, drainage
and ventilation, prevention of disease, hy
fienlc cooking and correct dress and diet
or chiildren. The percentage of sickness
has greatly decreased and families, in all
classes, never had -so much comfort as
they now enjoy. Any unprejudiced per
son must admit the truth of these state
ments, and at the same time acknowledge
that women are doing a grander work
than ever, before in the . schools, the
churches, the charities, the reforms and
all the varied departments of human ac-
Uvlties.V Â¦:<Â¦Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ -':-.'-> : " -
Â¦ "Her afflicted husband comes. home to
find it empty I or - occupied ?by â¢ a woman
whose heart is void of affection for hltn.
Then arise quarrels, estrangement and
often divorce." Well, 'of course we could
give a more unbiased judgment' in regard
to all this if we knew at .what hour the
afflicted husband gof home. and. whether
he was drunk or sober, and where he had
been spending his time previous to his ar
rival. Under the old dispensation the wife
was .-expected ' to- sit patiently, at-home
twenty-four hours out of the twenty-four,
awaiting -her lord's return, and -then Â¦to
"meet him with a smile." When it was
not lodge- night it was club night, and
when it wasn'teither he had to go down
street toisee a man, and,' finally, it struck
her that she might as well have her lodge
and club and go around the corner occa
sionally to see a ; woman. > St. Paul told
the wife to learn of her husband at home,
and this is what she learned. Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢-â¢Â¦

THE MARKET-STREET PROBLEM.
1~~) ETWEEN the merchants doing business along
\\ Market street, on the one side, and the owners
*Â¦ â and drivers of teams on the other, there has
arisen a controversy as to the best means of taking
care of Market street, and incidentally of, all. other
streets paved with asphalt. The horse-owners and
drivers, backed by the Association for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals," protest against the sprinkling
of asphalt pavement, because when moist such pave
ments become so slippery as to endanger teams that
are driven over them. On the other hand, the mer
chants contend that, to leave Market street un
sprinkled entails a large injury to merchandise and a
continuous annoyance of the public by dust.
Each side to the controversy has valid reasons to
support its contention. It is indisputable that when
asphalt pavements are wet they constitute serious
menace to teams, and indirectly to persons; but it
is equally true that in a city so dusty and so windy
as San Francisco it is absolutely necessary to do
something to lay the dust and clean the streets.
There is but one sure solution of the problem.
The Call some time ago directed attention to the fact
that in Eastern and in European cities the authori
ties sprinkle the asphalt pavements with .sand in the
early morning, while they are wet with fog or dew,
and then sweep the sand away later in the day. The
sand serves a double benefit. In the first place it pre
vents the pavement from becoming slippery when wet.
and in the second place it affords a material which
when swept up carries with it all dust or other refuse
of the streets, leaving them dry arid clean for the
traffic of the business hours.
As the practice of sand-sprinkling has been adopted
in nearly all notably clean cities where asphalt pave
ments have been laid, it may be taken as proven that
such sprinkling is a necessary adjunct . ; to" asphalt
pavements: In no other way yet devised is it possible
at an economical cost to settle the double problem of
getting rid of dust I without making the pavements
slippery.
In San Francisco the cost of sand-sprinkling can
not be large, for there is an abundance of clean white
sand to be had with no further cost than that of dig
ging and hauling. It is to be remembered that the
plan is not a novel one, and does not entail the risk
of an experiment. It has been tried in many places
and has proven so advantageous that it is now in gen
eral use in some of the largest cities on the globe.
Certainly something will have to be done, for we can
not expose the merchants and the passers along Mar
ket street to the dust and the winds of the coming
summer without doing something to clean the street
and keep down the dust: neither would it be right to
resort to sprinkling, which would make the asphalt
slippery. There are times and occasions when cities
need sand, and this is one of them.

tion of 26 per cent. That is a specious and good
showing, but it will be remembered that when the
treaty was under discussion in the Chamber of Depu
ties the French Ministers, with an equal array of fig
ures, showed that all the concessions were on our
side and that the treaty was of vast benefit to France.
It is not .worth while to juggle with the details of
statistics of that kind. As a matter of fact the pro
posed treaty was to admit, to the markets of the
United States a large number of French- products at
much lower duty rates than those fixed by the Dingley
tariff. That would have 'meant injury, if not ruin, to
a considerable number of American industries. Thus
the treaty would have destroyed the universality of
the protective principle. It would have sacrificed
some interests for the benefit of others. Such a pol
icy would of course have been unfair and inexpedient.
There must be protection for the farmer as well as
for the manufacturer, for the fruit-grower as well as
for the cotton-spinner, for the Californian as well as
for the people of Mr. Kasson's State, lowa, for other
wise there would soon rise a discontent. which would
reopen the whole tariff controversy and renew the
agitations and discords that so disturbed commerce
and industry while that issue was at stake between
political parties.

6could 6ay the whole "Iliad" and "Odys
sey" by heart, and his example was prob
ably not unique. The young Alcibiades
indignantly struck a schoolmaster who
confessed that he had nothing of Hom
er's, and Alexander the Great admitted
that he had formed himself on the char
acter of Achilles. The elegiac poets de
velop verse and language out of the epic,
and all the greatest lyric poets show
Homer's Influence â none more than Pin
dar. In an Important sense Homer was
the master of Herodotus and Thucydides;
and Greek grammarians, as well as Ger
man critics, have discussed the Homeric
style and thought in both historians.
Aeschylus called his tragedies "frag
ments from Homer's great banquets."
and Sophocles received no higher praise
than "the tragic Homer." The Homeric
style and language are noticeable In
Plato, as well as the latter';* frequent
citation of the epic poet. Even Demos
thenes la said to have imitated Homer.
In the . Alexandrine poetry Homeric In
fluence was predominant, especially la
Theocritus. Indeed Homer was thÂ» key
to all subsequent Greek literature, as no
other poet has ever been to any other
literature, even the Influence of the Eng
lish Bible being less determinative In. our
own literature.
Who was Homer? When and where waa
he born? What works did he compose?
There I* perfect agreement only as to tho
name. TV edo not know who Homer was.
According to a Greek epigram, seren
cities claimed to be Homer's blnnplace;
but, in fact, far more places on both sides
of the Aegean and among the islands ar
rogated this distinction, and thÂ« state
ments as to the date of his birth range
over more than 400 years. This la Tn
reality perhaps a tradition of the rise and
spread of epic poetry. And what did Ho
mer compose? â¢ Earlier Greek antiquity
attributed to him pretty much the wholo
body of the epic poetry, but Alexandrin*
scholarship denied his title to all except
the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey." Even the
unity of the authorship of these two was
attacked, but the authority of Axistarchus.
the greatest of ancient scholars, silenced
the so-called "separators." Early in the
eighteenth century a Neapolitan claimed
that Homer's poema were * made by a
series of poets and not committed to writ-
Ing at first, but proofs in support of this
view were first given In F. A, Wolfs fa
mous "Prolegomena" (1796). Wolf argued
that our Homer was originally many
small unwritten poems, the unity being
due to a commission In the- time of Plsis
tratus (sixth century). Wolfs followers,
especially Lachmann. attempted to dissect
the "Iliad" Into the original lays. All
great Greek scholars of all lands have In
the last century been arrayed on on* side
or the other of the Homeric question, and
It has been almost, as far-reaching In
philology aa the Darwinian theory has
been In science. By a natural reaction the
trend of opinion is again rather toward an
original nucleus or central poem, greater
or smaller; but critical opinion does not
tend toward unity of authorship of both
"Iliad" and "Odyssey."
Of translations of the "Iliad," Lord
Derby's in verse, and Lang. Leaf and
Meyers, in prose, may be especially men
tioned; but other versions, such as Chap
man's, Pope's, Cowper^s, Bryant's, have
many claims to consideration. For the
"Odyssey." Worsley's translation In verse
and Butcher and Lang's In prose are
doubtless unequaled. though Palmer's
rhythmical prose version merits especial
commendation.
Valuable helps to the general reader In
appreciating Homer are, besides the histo
ries of Greek literature, Jebb's "Introduc
tion," Leaf's "Companion to the Iliad,"
Agnes M. Clerke's "Familiar Studies In
Homer." Jebb's "Classical Greek Poetry."

Menelaus, and most beautiful of Greek
women, and all the chivalry of Hellas, un
der the leadership of Agamemnon, was
besieging Troy to recover Helen. The
poem opens in the tenth year of the war,
and the period of action is only about
forty-two days. With consummate art
the poet plunges at once in medias res,
as If all the previous course of the war
were known. Achilles had advised Aga
memnon to stay a pestilence in the camp
by restoring his captive Chrysels to her
father, the priest of Apollo. The haughty
Agamemnon restored the maiden, but in
sulted Achilles by taking his own captive,
Brisels. Whereupon Achilles, obeying the
goddess Athena, had not slain Agamem
non, but renounced the war. Persuaded
by Achilles' goddess-mother, Thetis, the
supreme god Zeus sent defeats and dis
asters upon the Greek host, and Agamem
non soon recognized that without Achilles
tHe Achaeans could not take Troy. In
vain he humiliated himself by sending an
embassy of the bravest and most honored
chiefs to offer fullest reparation to
Achilles, even Agamemnon's own daugh
ter as a bride. Achilles was inexorable.
Worse disasters follow. The greatest
' Achaean leaders are wounded. Hector is
1 storming the Greek camp, and only AJax
saves the ships from fire. At last Achilles
permits Patroclus to lead out the Myrmi
dons against the foe, but he falls a vic
tim to his own recklessness, and his body,
stripped of Achilles' armor, Is rescued
only by prodigies of valor on the part of
Ajax ana Menelaus. Achilles' grief was
terrific. He threw himself on the ground,
cast dust on his head and . dress and
writhed in agony. Desire for revenge now
took the place of anger. He appeared on
the rampart and gave a battle snout which
dismayed the bravest Trojans and made
their very horses cower and tremble. As
soon as Thetis could procure his other
armor from Hephaestus, the artificer of
the gods, Achilles attacked the Trojans
and slew their bravest, last of all Hector.
Patroclus' dead body then received splen
did funeral rites and Hector's corpse was
restored to the aged Priam.
The "Iliad" and "Odyssey" are not di
dactic poems, but they present a remark
able picture of Achaean life. "In a man
ner, chiefly incidental," says Mr. Glad
stone, "there is supplied to us a mass of
information in history and legend, relig
ion, polity, justice, domestic life and hab
its, ethnical and social relations, the con
ditions of warfare, navigation. Industry
and of the useful arts, exceeding in
amount what has ever at any other pe
riod been brought for use into one focus
by a single mind, except possibly by the
philosophical works of Aristotle, If we
possessed them entire." "The Homeric
poems," says ' Mr. Gladstone again, "have
also through the intervention of the
Greek and then of. the Roman civilization,
for both of which they form an .original
literary base, entered far more largelj
than any other book, except Holy Scrip
ture, into the formation, of modern
thought and life." < . -
In the Greek drama, characters are apt
to represent " types, but in Homer the
characters are marked by the clearest and
subtlest distinctions. In the "Iliad" the
protagonist is easily the most conspicu
ous and attractive figure. Of all the he
roes he is the tallest, strongest, fleetest
and most beautiful, an orator whose su
premacy is acknowledged by Ulysses, and
whose chief. speech (in book 9) Js consid
ered by Mr. Gladstone unsurpassed in the
annals of eloquence for 3000 years. A mu
sician he Is, too, and next to the divine
Paeon perhaps best understands the art
of healing.: His love for Patroclus passes
that of women; he- is the soul of honor,
and above deceit. Irascible and Inexora
ble, yet quick to pity and gentle to the
helpless. He idealizes the youth of the
Greek : race, "a . lustrous figure, Â¦ ever po
tent, ever young, but with the ash-whltÂ©
aureole of coming death around his Â¦ fore
head." Under the hands of the dramat
ists his Immortal character never degen
erated as did even that of- Ulysses.
As Achilles represented the element of
passion, so did Ulysses the function of in
tellect. He Is pre-eminently distinguished
by- forethought,.- presence -of mind . and
self-controlâ the shrewdest and wiliest of
the Greeks,' a profound and astute man
of the ; world. The "Odyssey", especially
glorifies his youthful . curiosity and spirit
of adventure; his resourcefulness and
manly endurance combined with a pas-

committee. If a motion was made to ap
point a Congressional committee It must
nave escaped the notice of the newspaper
reporters.
The foregoing statement of fact is made
because the Republican County Commit
tee will meet this evening, and the com
mitteemen representing Assembly districts
in the Fifth Congressional District may be
able to enlighten the voters on the propo
sition. Again, the Fourth Congressional
District Committee met last night and
adopted a resolution authorizing a confer
ence with the Congressional Committee
of the Fifth District. Mr. Watt's conclu
sions may be correct and proper, but the
record which he refers to should be pro
duced. The Republicans of San Francisco,
San Mateo ana Santa Clara know their
rightÃ and they will have what is right
and regular. It is drue that delegates to
the National Republican Convention can
not meet as delegates to nominate a can
didate for Congress in the Fifth District,
but they can send delegates to Philadel
phia to nominate higher officers.
FOURTH DISTRICT.
Meeting of the Congressional Com-
mittee Last Night.
Initial steps for the selection of dele
gates to the Republican National Conven
tion to assemble at Philadelphia June 19
were taken last evening at Pythian Cas
tle by the district committee of the
Fourth Congressional District.
The meeting was called to order at 8:30
o'clock by Joseph Spear Jr., chairman of
the committee. The following named com.
mitteemen responded by living voice when
the roll was called: Joseph Spear, P. H.
Prendergast, A. Barnard, Dr. P. A. Kear
ney, A. Ruef, William Howe, James Mc-
Cabe, Albert Houston, Charles Metzner,
J. A. Hoey, M. Smith, Martin Brady, J.
H. Nelson and James Snook.
A. Ruef announced that he held the
proxy of J. Levi Jr., R. H. Williams, D.
D. Lustlg, and Thomas F. Lennon did not
respond in person or by proxy.
The secretary read the minutes, which
proved to be a record of the proceedings
of the session of the Fourth Congres
sional District Convention at which Julius
Kahn was nominated for Congress. The
minutes also recorded the fact that the
committee now representing the district
was appointed in open convention at thn
time the nomination for Representative
in Congress was made. The approval of
the record immediately followed.
A. Barnard, obtaining recognition from
the chair, introduced resolutions with a
preamble. In the preamble it is set forth
that the National Committee of the Re
publican party, by its call dated Decem
ber 20, 1899, did provide for the election
and constitution of the next Republican
National Convention. The preamble then
quotes the language of the call relating to
the number of delegates and the manner
of their selection.
The last paragraph of the preamble and
the resolutions introduced by Mr. Barnard
are as follows:
Whereas. Under said call it becomes thÂ«
duty of this, the Republican Congressional
Committee of the Fourth- Congressional
District of the State of California, which
Congressional Committee -was duly appoint
ed by the Republican Congressional Con
vention of the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trlct of the State of California on the
3d day of September, 1898, and was duly
organized and in existence from said last
named date up to and including the said
date of said call by said National Repub
lican Committee and up to and including
the present date, to call a convention frr
the election of said Congressional District
delegates and the'.r alternates for the
Fourth Congressional District of the State
of California In accordance with said call
of the said national committee; now, there
fore, be it
Resolved, By this, the Republican Con-
Krensional Committee ot the Fourth Con
gressional District of the State of Cali
fornia, ' that a Concessional District Con
vention of the Republican party of the
Fourth Congressional District of the State'
of California be called for the election of
Raid Congressional District delegates and
their alternates; that said convention con
sist of delegates elected at an open primary
election to be held under the auspices of
this committee; that the chairman of this
committee be and hereby Is authorized to
appoint a committee of three members of
this committee to formulate and prepare a
call for said convention and said primary
election and to report the said call to this
committee for consideration and action
thereon at the r.ezt meeting ot this com
mittee.
The foregoing was adopted without dis
sent.
P. H. Prendergrast introduced the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted
unanimously: - . â¢
Whereas, The city and county of San
Francisco comprises a part of the Fifth
Congressional -District and the -whole of the
Fourth; and
Whereas. It will be incumbent upon the
Republican Fifth Congressional Committee
to take action under the call of the na
tional committee: and . ,
Whereas, It is desirable that the action
of the Republican Congressional District
committees of the Fourth and Fifth Con- ;
gresslonal districts should be In harmony
and accord. . â¢ Â¦
Resolved, That the chairman of this com
mittee be and he Is hereby empowered and
directed to appoint a committee of three
members of this committee to confer with
the Fifth Congressional Committee with a
view to securing the adoption of a uniform
and united line of action in reference to
the selection of Congressional District dele
gates to the national convention and In the
Interest of the Republican party and the
success of its principles at the coming
* election.
Chairman Spear announced the follow
ing committee in accordance with the res
olutions: P. H. Prendergast, A. Barnard
and Dr. P. A. Kearney. On motion, Mr.
Spear was added to the committee.
The committee then adjourned to meet
at the call of the chair.
VESTERDAT Jam*s Alva Watt sÂ«nt
out -notices for a meeting of the
. V Fifth Congressional District Re-
I publican Committee at the office of
-*- W. H. Cobb, in the Parrott bi'lM
ing, to-morrow evening. This committee,
which was appointed by Mr. Watt In
June, 1899. consitts of the following resi
dents of the district: Â¦"
E. I. Robinson, W. H. Cobb. Frank
French, G. H. Fairchild. Max Goldberjj,
Jesse Marks, F. R, Danforth, Alvinza
Hayward, R. Donovan, Louis O'Neil and
J. D. McKenzie.
The last named three reside in Santa
Clara County. Mr. Hay ward is a resident
of San Mateo County, and the others live
in San Francisco; but all dwell in the
Fifth District. .
The Call is not advised that any ono has
sought to cast reflection on the character
or Intelligence of the men comprising the
committee, yet the fact is undisputed that
there has been a deal of comment In po
litical circles concerning the regularity
of the committee's appointment. For the
sake of harmony and regularity in the
preliminary work of selecting delegates to
the Republican National Convention, this
Journal deems it proper to make a state
ment of the facts In the case at this time.
James Alva Watt, chairman of the Fifth
Congressional District Convention that
nominated EX F. Loud for Congress, as
serts that the convention before adjourn
ment authorized the chairman to appoint
a Congressional District Committee. HÂ«
asserts that he is in possession of the
record of the convention's proceedings,
duly attested by the secretary, E. D.
Crawford, which clearly shows that such
a resolution was adopted. He says fur
ther that he is ready to produce that rec
ord if its production becomes necessary.
He admits freely that he prepared the
record himself, which the secretary read
and approved. He acknowledges that he
did not appoint the committee until the
month of June, 1599, more than eight
months after the convention adjourned
and seven months after the close of the
Congressional campaign. He insists,
however, that the proceedings were regu
lar and that ho will maintain their regu
larity against all comers. Judge Dibble
also vouches for the regularity of the
record.
The recollection of E. D. Crawford of
Gilroy, who performed the duties of sec
retary of the convention, differs from that
of Mr. Watt. Mr. Crawford says in a
letter to The Call that he has mislaid hla
notes, but he recollects that a resolution
was adopted authorizing Mr. Loud, the
nominee for Congress, and the' chairman
of the convention to appoint the commit
tee. He mentions that P. H. Prendergast
assisted in keening the record and re
quests that the latter be questioned. Mr.
Prendergast believes that he wrote the
resolution himself and that it authorized
Mr. Loud and the chairman to name the
committee. , '
Mr. Ix>ud wires to The Call from Wash
ington, D. C. that he knew nothing about
the appointment of the committee. Mr.
Watt, however, asserts that Mr. Loud
does not in any sense question the reg
ularity of the committee's appointment,
as the Congressman representing the
Fifth District was duly advised of all pro
ceeding's in the premises.
Refefenoe has been made to the files of
The Call, Chronicle and Examiner con
taining reports of the convention. The
Call and Chronicle mention the appoint
ment of a committee on purity of elec
tions and publish the names of the men
appointed on this committee, but no refer
ence direct or remote is made to a Con
gressional committee. The Examiner did

manly Ideals of the Hellenic race. Other
clearly drawn characters are the stubborn

Trojans most conspicuous are Hector, the
knightly gentleman and bulwark of Troy,
and his aged father Priam, who has suf

to Achilles for his son's body, saying: "I

m HOMER AND THE GREEK
EPICS.
BY CHARLES FORSTER SMITH, PH.D.
It is a commonplace of criticism that
Homer Is one of the three greatest writ
ers of the world, and Matthew Arnold is
doubtless right in considering the Ho
meric poems "the most important poetical
monuments existing." Homer gives us
an extraordinarily vivid and Interesting
picture of the world's young springtime.
The Greeks were the first people that
came with eyes to see: the world was
young and fresh and fair; things and
Ideas were still in large part unnamed
and the Greeks had the instinct to give
names that would describe. Homer por
trays a life that he knows, and describes
things naively, simply, directly and un
ashamed. The "Iliad" and the "Odys
sey" are the eternal books of youth, and
a perpetual lesson in good taste, because
their form is perfect. But the "Iliad" and
the "Odyssey," though the earliest Greek
poems extant, are not the work of a
primitive poet, nor do they describe an
initial stage of Greek civilization; rather
they mark the close of an epoch. They
presuppose long periods of development,
and the form of the verse was unques
tionably the growth of centuries of liter
ary culture. The great Achaean age,
which Homer Represents, and of which
the siege of Troy was doubtless the most
notable event, culminated before Homer,
and its cataclysm came no great while
after In the Dorian invasion.
The real theme of the "Iliad" is tha
wrath of Achilles. ! Paris of Troy had

Because Miss H. M. Falrchild, principal
of the Golden Gate Primary School, en
couraged the mothers of her pupils to
frame a protest against the action of the
Board of Education in abolishing: the spe
cial study of sewing, that lady at yester
day's meeting of the board was suspended
from the department for five days with
out pay. The board, in its offended dig
nity, passed resolutions which recited that
"Miss Falrchlld had been guilty cf a
grave breach cf discipline in not sustain
ing the board," and thus demonstrated
that teachers must now keep their mouths
closed with regard to any of its official
acts.
Miss Fairchlld's offense, which is con
sidered such a heinous one by the Direc
tors, consisted In presiding at a meeting
of the Mothers' Club held the day after
Miss N. H. Mayberry was removed from
her position as special sewing teacher in
the Golden Gate School, and in drafting
a letter which was copied by the pupils
and signed by their parents requesting
the board to reinstate Miss Mayberry.
At the regular secret session of the
board held last Tuesday Miss Falrchild
came very near to being severely dealt
with. One Director insisted that she bo
suspended for five months. This was re
duced to one month,- but was most stren
uously opposed by Superintendent Wsb
ster, who said that it was the first time in
the history of the department that a
teacher had been disciplined. Finally the
board compromised on a five days' suÂ«
pension. ,
The fact that the petition of the sub
stitute teachers to restore their salary to
$3 50 per diem when employed had been
turned down at the star chamber session
caused the presentation of resolutions by
Superintendent Webster providing that on
and after March 7, â¢ 1900. day substitute
teachers be paid 53 per diem when teach
ing classes of the second, third and fourth
grades; $4 per diem when teaching classes
of the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth
and ninth grades; $6 per diem when teach
ing in high schools and when acting as
vice principals of grammar schools; when
not engaged in teaching $1 per diem for
reporting for duty.
The sum of $2000 was appropriated tor
the purchase of books for the use of
needy children, and a further sum of $2000
for the school libraries, to be apportioned
by the Superintendent according to the
provisions of the Political Code.
The title of vice principal of the Wash
ington and of business evening schools
was abolished and the position designated
as class teachers at $50 per month.
The salary schedule fixing the amount
of $2 50 per room for janitorial service of
the evening schools was abolished.
In deference to a writ of injunction is
sued by the Superior Court, all principals
and teachers were directed to cease using
the text books of the Shaylor system or
vertical round hand penmanship and sub
stitute therefore the California vertical
system of penmanship.
The Board of Public "Works gave notice
of the dismissal of the following Janitors
of the public schools, to take effect March
15, 1900: S. F. Hodgkins, Miss W. 3e la
Fontaine, John Kavanaugh. Mrs. E. Cav

Chicago Grain Market.
New York Stock Market.
NKW YORK. March ".âProfessional bear
operators suspended their campaign for a de
cline In the stock market to-day. TnÂ« bull
contingent on the other hand was hampered
by the continually increasing closer conditions
In the money market and by the determined
Indifference of the outside public. In conse
<juencÂ« dealings on the exchange approached
the point of stagnation and the movement of
prices was entirely without Â¦lg-nlflcJLnce. At
tention T"Â»Tiy money lenders and capitalists
as well a* among stock operators is devoted to
the probable effects of the currency bill and
when It shall become operative. As to the
volume of expansion of the currency opinion
Is agreed that additional note issues will t<
made at once up to the par value of. bonds
at present on deposit to secure circulation,
which is ellghtly over $240,000,003. The IC p*r
cent Increase thus Indicated will be $24,0GC.u00.
As to the extent beyond this to which '.ha ex
pansion is likely to proceed all is conjecture
and opinion is exceedingly varied. On t*ie
present national bank' capitalization, which
amounts to $606,000,000. a further note issue is
IÂ«rmissJble under the Jaw of $366,000,000. but
the totul amount of the bonds to be converted
end which are available to secure circulation
is nearly $Â«40.000.0n0. and the additional capital
which may be embarked in national banks In
nmaller cities undÂ«r the law makes possible
a further extension of circulation as fast a&
national bank capital is Increased. But thlÂ»
possibly Is purely theoretical. The more the
<iuestlon is canvacsrd of the possible effects
at xh" operation of the law the more .it *is
perceived that hindrances may arise to taking
out additional circulation. In the first place
the constant advance in the price of Govern
ment bonds may eat up the margin waicj
would leave a profit in circulation. There li
ft quÂ«*eUon aJw> of the ability of the banks
to keep their notes in circulation. They can
not lx- counted In tlie lawful money reÂ»ervÂ«
required by law and at the same time they
Fw<-ll the deprslt liabilities of the banks. In
<-onHetjuonce unless an active demand exists for
the upe.of currency in hand-to-hand transac
tion* the banks wouki derive no advantage by
lf^r'riK tn * notes in their vaults and rvouM
K'-nd them In for redemption as fast as re
crived. On the other hand even if the notes
k^'-p in circulation there is the question <>f
liov.- â¢ far they would serve to displace ie;al
trnderr. thus facilitating gold exports. Lastly
there is the question of delay in the prepajji
tir>n of the new bonds from purely mechanical
difficulties, which may last sÂ»\-eral months,
Firx-e there is no power in thÂ» Treasury De
parunent to anticipate the operation of the
law by rrerarinÃ bonds in advance. With the
diubt thus Involved of the amount of relief
to iw .afforded to the money market by rl.e
operation of the new law and of the time when
thÂ» relief will be available transactions on the
Stock ICxchange are much curtailed.

London Market.
NEW YORK. March " 7.â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The Inactivity which has characterized the
markets here recently continued to-day. They
began firm, but fell away generally In the af
ternoon on the reported spread of the rebellion
of Cape Dutch, although the real reasons were
probably the complete absence of public sup
port and the coming war loan which Is al
ready quoted at 1 to VI premium, although the
denominations 'and date are quite unknown.
Americans opened firm, but half an hour ex
hausted the business and New York failed to
respond. London seems fairly willing to buy,
but New York avoids giving a lead. Paris put
Tlntos to a fresh recordâ l4â but the close was
unchanged at t>3V
The bank bought Â£30.000 gold In bars and
Â£50,000 has been engaged for Argentina,
Call money and fixtures were wanted and the
bank renewed a moderate amount of loans and
did a large fresh business In them and also

BOSTON, March 7.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has been almost lifeless since our last
.report. There has" been but little inquiry for
any kind of stock, as most manufacturers have
been practically out of the market, being pretty
well supplied for the time being, and will not
be tempted to buy. Those who are not plenti
fully'supplied have been holding oft, pending
the opening of .the London wool sales, and the
fact that these sales opened on Tuesday at a
decline of 7% to 10 per cent has not been cal
culated to Induce them to hasten their pur
chases of the raw material. In such a dull
condition of affairs the market Is naturally
weak, although at this writing owners of wool
have not manifested any marked disposition to
press sales, as they well know that many
manufacturers are so well stocked with wool
that it would require considerable concession
to Induce them to take hold. The sales of the
week In Boston amounted to 1.500.000 domestic
and 85,000 foreign, making a total of :.885.000.
against a total of 2.391.000 for the previous
week, and a total of 3.332.000 for the corres
ponding week last yea?. The sales since Janu
ary 1 amount to 32,501,000 pounds, against 36,
802,500 pounds for the corresponding time last
years.
LONDON, March 7.â There was .a full at
tendance at the second day's session of the
present series of wool auction and trading was
keener all around, the Continent securing the
most medium, greasy wools. The home trade
took principally scoureds, and crossbreds were
well competed for by the home and American
representatives. Cape of Good Hope and Natal
were In small " supply, being mostly short
wooled. and sold at ten per cent below the
January series. The number of bales offered
was 13,440. -

LOCAL MARKETS.
CHICAGO. March 7.â Wheat formed a mod
erately active market at times, but generally
both the speculative and the cash prospect
were bare, resulting In a very narrow range.
May opened at 66?/66%c, and supported by St.
Louis buying and higher cables advanced to
CSSfiGG'ic. An unfavorable report of crop con
ditions In Ohio, conjuring up visions of dam
ages in other States as well, received some
consideration also. Until nearly noon the mar
ket clung steadily around 66c. Then Influences
in the. shape of a break at St. Louis, liberal
receipts and the light demand made themselves
felt, bearing May to 65% c. The close was
barely steady. May Â»4c down at 65%@65%c. The
unusually heavy receipts of flour, Â¦ 175,000 bar
rels, excited considerable Interest here, but it
Is said that most of the stuff was merely in
transit for Liverpool. .
Corn was strong nearly the . whole session,
yielding a bit at the end on profit-taking, but
closing I'.rm. The malfi support was the as
sertion tr-at a Baltimore exporter had taken
1.W0.00Q bushels from here within- tne last two
days. May closed a shade up.
Oats were dull and steady most of the time
with corn, but yielding Anally with the. wheat
break. May closed <Â«i: under. Â¦: , â¢
The provision pit was re;narl:nb'e for Its
dullness. It was half deserted At times and
trades were small and far between. There was,
however. Just enough cash letnand 10 keep
stocks from ..accumulating and this,- combined
with the strength of com.' neld the market
steady as a fashion. May pork â¢ Ics.M i'fec

unchanged. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ' .
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Charles T. Davis' Participa
"i tion in the "Great Short
Deal."
Arrest of the "Wall-Street Editor Be
; calls a Famous Mining Transac
tion of Twenty-Five
Years Ago.
? .. â j â¢ .
New York dispatches announce . the in
dictment by special Grand Jury of Charle3
T. Davis, editor- of the Wall-street Re
view, and five other men on the charge
that they circulated false reports in order
to depress Brooklyn Rapid Transit stock
and profit by the decline. Davis was ar
raigned on three indictments, two alleging
felony and one misdemeanor, and was
held in $11,000 bail. â¢
Charles Thomas Davis was well known
here in the seventies and especially is re
membered for the events of 1875, in which
he was a moving figure In connection with
the great short deal of "Jim" Keene in
"the big bonanza mines," shares in which
the bonanza firm of Flood, O'Brien, Fair
and Mackay were the principal holders.
Many old-timers, now that the rancor of
a quarter of a century ago has passed
away, do not care to antagonize Jim
Keene or to throw, stones at. the grave of
one of the engineers who made what was
popularly styled "the bogus map" of the
big bonanzas. George R. Wells, who was
an attorney for -Flood and was an "in
sider, remembers that there was a. Charles
Davis here. but. he says that he does not
know whether the one in trouble In, New
York is the one he knew.
.Two persons have been discovered
who are sure, that Charles Thomas Davis
Is the one who operated in San Fran
cisco to the large advantage of Jim Keene
in the campaign to short the shares of the
big bonanza. .One of these is Denia Kear
ney; the other is Richard Wheeler, once
a writer for the financial and mining
stock department of the San Francisco
Alta. Kearney recollects Davis because
Davis attacked him' with a cane on a San
Francisco street when the discussion over
the "new constitution" that California
adopted in the seventies was hot. Kearney
had Davis arrested and he was 'fined $100
for the assault. Kearpey' says, that Da
vis was working to bear the shares of tha
big bonanza, and that Keene. was playing
on the same side of the market.
When Davis and Keene were discovered
to be working together in New York a
New York detective agency put the In
vestigation of the antecedents of Davis
into the hands of Curtin's Detective
Agency In this city. Wheeler made! a
statement to Curtin, of which the follow
ing are the salient points: He knew Da
vis well. He was the mining editor of- the
San Francisco Alta In 1875. Davis came to
him and told him that he was connected
with Humbert Brothers, who were min
ing engineers. He also said that he had
inside information â¢ about Consolidated
California and Virginia stocks, and that
there was a party in town who had come
to raid these stocks. Subsequently Davis
made other statements to the same effect,
and the statements were published by
Wheeler in the Alta, which was then the
leading financial publication of the city.
After a while Wheeler found out that the
statements were wholly false and without
foundation.
The Humberts had prepared a map of the
bonanza mines, which was subsequently
denounced as "the bogus map." Wheeler
was under the impression that -Davis, was
then only pretending to act with the
Humberts, but that he was really act
ing with Flood. Keene made much
money on the market eventually. I Davis
was on the side all the time, that Keene
"pretended to be." "Davis was- then
about 30 years old, undersized, medium
build,. fresh complexion, an Englishman.
Friends of Flood do not take the view
that Jim Keene. was playing on the same
side of the market as Flood. On the con
trary, they assert strongly that he was
fighting Flood, and that after the map
made by the Humbert brothers had been
used to > short stocks it. was subsequently
proved to be only enough right to de
ceive. .After the bogus map had shown
that the vein broke off dividends' were
paid for four years and Flood and Mackay
took out dividends at the rate of $1,200,000
per month for a long time. Keene and
Davis both-affected to believe that the
bogus map was genuine. .:. -? _ : Â¦

did not supply with a scholarly and sym

PRESSURE BEARS
ON MEMBERS OF
BROTHERHOODS
Railroad Officials Trying to
Break Down Phalanx
of Opposition.
Under Demand From Headquarters
Three Conductors Said to Have
Joined the Huntington
' Belief Bureau.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway. March 7.
Railroad men find no comfort in the of
ficial announcement from headquarter*
that no compulsion will be used to induce
employes to join the Huntlngton relief
bureau. It Is asserted as the belief of the
workmen that General Manager Krutt
schnitt's proclamation Is nothing- more
than a> device to sway public opinion if
possible toward the railroad company in
the fight which is on over the Insurance
scheme.
That the employes take no stock In tha
manifesto Is evident from the fact that It
has not deterred them from going ahead
with the organization of their union
grievance committee which is to go before
the headquarters officials with their ob
jections to the plan. While extremely
guarded in their statements in public, tha
Oakland railroad men do not hesltata
among themselves to attack every phase
of the proposition. That the officials aru
alarmed over the situation and fear mora
serious results than mere verbal criticism
has been made known to the men from
developments of the past twenty-four
hours.
It is certain now that a lot of spies and
"spotters" have been thrown among tha
men to report upon their bearing toward
the scheme. Further than that It is cur
rent talk among the men that the offi
cials are moving quietly but surely to
create dissension in the ranks of brother
hood members.
In the Order of Railway Conductors
there has been a strong attempt to start
the men toward an open support of the
Insurance project. While the greatest
secrecy is maintained concerning every
move of the conductors and the other
brotherhoods there is a well defined re
port among the West Oakland yards that
the railroad officials have tried to break
into the ranks of the brotherhoods and
have been straining every effort to lnducw
some of the men to openly avow sym
pathy with the proposed relief depart
ment. . - -
The report lacks definite confirmation
because the men are afraid to remove
the ban of secrecy from their meeting
proceedings. It lÂ», strongly declared
among the men, however, that the
â¢ strenuous efforts of the headquarters
officials have resulted so far in no serious
breaks in the ranks. Three of the main
line conductors, it ia understood, have
made application for membership in tha
relief bureau, but this defection Is not
considered- of serious importance, as the
men have expected that a few of the en
gineers and conductors would take such
a step.
With the conductors, trainmen ami
firemen represented in the grievance
committee, there remains yet to com
plete the- committee by representation
from the Brotherhood of Engineers,
which .will meet on Friday evening.
The general committee's meeting. Bet for
Saturday' night, will probably determine
Just what form the combined opposition
to the relief bureau will take.
Division Â¦ Superintendent Agler has re
ceived instructions to use every endeavor
to conciliate the men and to turn the
tide .of disapproval of the Insurance
project. There has been no evidence that
the men have any desire to compromise
at present. While they do not openly
avow themselves in favor of a walkout,
there are many men in the company's
employ- who feel very belHjrerent. But
a strike is a matter of the distant future.
if such a conrsp shall ever bÂ«Â» taken.

Long List of Victims of
the Red Ash Colliery
Disaster.
ONLY ONE MAN ESCAPED
Lone Survivor Declares There Is No
Reason to Hope That Any of
His Comrades Are Still
Alive.
FIRE CREEK, Va., March 7.â The res
cuing parties. continued working hard at
the Red ABh mine to-day and to-night
removing and securing bodies of the vlc
tlmu of the explosion of Â¦ yesterday. The
most conservative estimates of those
connected with the mines places the num
ber kiUed at fifty-two, while it Is gener
ally believed that the number will be
found to be sixty-two. Six more bodies
were recovered early this morning. A re
port from the rescuers at the mine after
b o'clock to-night was that thirty-four vic
tims had been recovered, twenty-nine be
ing dead and five seriously injured.
while the surviving miners and others
estimated that there are at least thirty
nine miners still entombed, General Man
ager Howell says there are only thirty
six still in the mine.
None of the mines in this district are
yet working, and thousands of persons
visited the scene of the Red Ash dis
aster to-day. No definite e4u.se for the
explosion h.-is yet been learned by Gov
ernor Atkinson, or the State and district
mine inspectors, who are investigating.
In addition to the dust and fire damp
theories, it was claimed to-dny that nat
ural gas had escaped into the mine and
that it ignited when the miners entered
yesterday with their lighted lamps.
The work of rescuing parties is retarded
by hot air, and it is feared the mine is
on fire. Air is pumped into the mine by
compression. It will be several days be
fore all the bodies are recovered, as they
arc scattered along for almost a mile
under the ground, and it will require much
time to clear the debris from this long
subterranean course.
The, only person who entered the mine
and who is known to have escaped alive
and without serious injury is Electrician
Evans, who was near the mouth of the
mine. In relating his experience Evana
said:
"I heard a low, rumbling sound, similar
to an earthquake, and 1 realized in an in
stant that lire damp had exploded. Be
fore the force of the concussion reached
me I threw myself down upon my face.
A sheet of flame, rock and debris shot
over my head. I managed to creep to the
mouth and Into the fresh air. My. God, It
was awful! 1 saw that I was the only one
left. Every one of the other fellows was
lost, I know." Â¦ â¢-. Â¦ '
A pathtic feature of the disaster is the
annihilation of the family of B. B. Lone,
fire boss. His wife died some time ago,
leaving to" his sole care two little bo>-s.
Having no one to. stay with them in their
desolate home, the boys begged to go With
their father into the mine, to spend' the
da 3 - -with him. He consented, and .when
the search is finished their blackened lit
tle bodies will be found\beÂ»lde that of
the father.
The unexplained cause Â«f the accident
has terrified miners 'in adjoining looali
â¢ fes. Mnny are afraid to go to work, and
It will- require the most searching inspec
tion by competent men to remove â¢ their
fears and induce the.m to return to their

BROWN APPOINTED
JUDGE FOR ALASKA
Railroad Influence Said to Be in a
Measure Responsible for His
Appointment.
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Presi
dent has nominated Melville G. Brown to
be United States Judge for Alaska. This
nomination came as a surprise to Pacific
Coast Congressmen. Perhaps the most
powerful influence brought to bear' in
Judge Brown's behalf came from New
York. Judge Dillon of New York City,
the attorney in so many railroad reorgani
zation matters, wrote a strong letter to
the President In support of Judge Brown,
whom he had known as attorney, in
Wyoming for the Union Pacific Railroad
when Judge Dillon was its chief counsel
in New York. There were other railroad
influences back of Judge Brown, princi
pally from California, where he. has a
number of relatives. He is a son-in-law
of J. W. Flllmore, superintendent of the
narrow gauge branch of the Southern Pa
cific from Oakland to Santa Cruz, and is
a cousin of J. A. Fillmore. manager of the
Southern Pacific at San Francisco. -
Judge Brown has been a practicing at

years and 'is nearly 60 years of age.
HAWAIIAN LEGISLATORS
ARE IN A PREDICAMENT
Receive No Instructions From Wash
ington Regarding the Holding
of a Session.
HONOLULU, Feb. 24.â According to the
Hawaiian constitution the Legislature
should have been called together on the
21st, but this Government had no instruc
tion from Washington, so the lawmakers
were not assembled. A few members of
the lower house met on the date men
tioned and then adjourned until to-day.
They will adjourn from day to day until
President McKinley is heard from.
The members of the Senate took no ac
tion. They believe that the situation is so
complicated that only a call of President
McKinley could straighten It out. During
the afternoon of the 21st Attorney General
Cooper communicated by telephone with
President Wilder of the Senate and Sena
tor Waterhouse, expressing the view that
the body should meet In some manner ana
adjourn. Mr. Wilder replied that he had
no authority to call the Senate together
acid would not attempt to do so until in
structed by President McKinley.
The action of the House in meeting has
been commented upon in various ways,
but the consensus of opinion seems to be
that the stand of Speaker Kaulukou was
correct. It is agreed that the constitu
tion has been compiled with and that the
House is now in session on proper lines.
Any technicality. in this regard has been
removed. It only remains now for the
sergeant at arms to notify country mem
bers that the House Is in session accord
ing to law and their presence is required.

ADVENTURER IS
HOUNDED AWAY
BY THE POLICE
A. Mongreni de Lassomm,
Under Many Cloaks, Is
Forced to Quit City.
>
Officers Livingston and McMurray
Finish Work on a Pathetic
Story Told by a Young
French Girl.
>
Through the efforts of Police Officer
Luke Livingston of the California-street
Police Station and Officer McMurray of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, Professor A. Mongrenl de
Lapsomm, who has masqueraded for many
\ ears under the guise of an illusionist and
j.restidigitateur, but who really was con
cealing the reality of conducting houses
of ill-fame and the business of import
ing young girls for immoral purposes, has
at last been driven from San Francisco.
It was reported at the California-street
Station last night by Officer Livingston
that the man had taken passage for
Hongkong on the America Maru. en route
to Paris, where he will probably remain.
On the 18th day of last February Officer
Livingston was called to a house at 1709
Powell street, where De Lassomm claimed
that his niece was being held a prisoner
x.g2dnÂ±t her will. Livingston investigated
the ca?e and found a girl, who gave the
name of Gabriel L. Hourenon. sick and in
the care nf a woman named Mrs. Sattler
tSSmon. The girl did not wish to be taken
away by De Lessomm and told the officer
a pathetic story of how she had been in
duced to leave her home in France by the
alleged illusionist, who told her that she
should go on the stage with him in Amer-
She said she was at present but 17 years
of age and had been compelled to enter
a house of 111 fame at 520 Dupont street,
instead of becoming a queen of the foot
lirtata as had been represented to her.
$hr beffged that she might not be thrust
t.iick into the power of the man who had
wrought her ruin, and Officer Livingston
irterested the Society for the Prevention
of Cru'-iiy to Children in her behalf. He
and Officer McMurray had the girl re
moved to the French Hospital after a con
sultation with the French Consul, and left
i-trict Instructions that De Lassomm
should njot see her under any pretense.
They then went to work, on the case,
hoj/i'ng to land the alleged seducer in San
Ouentin Meanwhile De Lassomm did see
tre" girl and after he had visited her a
few times she switched her story and re
fused to prosecute the man. .
LÂ»Â« Lassomm disposed of his house of 111â
fame on Dupont street to Louisa Fay and
pr-pared to leave the city when he found
that the police were on his tracks. Re
rently the officers discovered that the gin
had been taken without their knowledge
by De Laffomm to a house at 515 Kearny
street, and then they realized the hope
lessness of their efforts in prosecuting the
man.
With De Lassomm was another woman,
over age, who he claims is his wife. She
also exerted her Influence with the girl to
prevent her from repeating the story and
at one time they were going to arrest
both women on charges of vagrancy.
They abandoned their efforts in this re
gard and started a crusade which re-
Fultfd in driving the man from this city.
Before he left he purchased tickets to
Paris and it is supposed that that place
will be hi* destination.

MORGAN TELLS
OF GEN. CORBIN'S
COWARDICE
His Actions in Battle Ex
cited Ridicule'' of. Officers*;.'
, and Men.
Seeks to Excuse Him,; However, on
the Plea of Extreme Youth
and Inexperience.
NEW YORK, March 7.â J. T. Morgan,
late colonel *of the Fourteenth United
States Colored Infantry, has written an
open letter to the Tribune with reference
to Adjutant General Corbln's . military
record during the Civil War.
He states that he is prompted to write
the letter by the frequent mentioning of
his name in connection with the Senate
resolution of inquiry as to the military
record oT General Corbln.
Colonel Morgan's letter deals principally
with the battle : at â¢ Nashville. Term.. De
cember-14 and 15, ;1Â«M;\ during- whico he
was in command of, an improvised division
of white and colored troops. The officers
commanding regiments under him includ
ed Lieutenant 'Colonel' Charles 11. Grosve
nor, now member of CorigressT Colonel
(now general) W. Rl Shafter and > Lieuten
ant Colonel (now general) Corbln'. .
Writing of this battle. Colonel Morgan
says:
"Colonel Shafter and Colonel Grosvenor
acquitted themselves with great credit,
Shafter showing special activity and cour
age and suffering the loss of many, of his
men.
"I was not with Lieutenant-Colonel Cor
bin during the lighting, but officers re
ported to me after the battle was ended
that he had betrayed such cowardice as
to excite the ridicule of both officers and
men. I spoke to him about 'it -and he at
once tendered me his resignation, subse
quently, however, withdrawing it.
"In my official report* of the battle I
said that I thought that Lieutenant Colo
nel Corbln did not have the courage requi
site to command brave men. Many years
afterward, when, the.' 'Rebellion records'
were about to be published,, I was. urged
to expunge that sentence before the re
port was published. This -I declined to.do
on two grounds â first, because I did not
feel at liberty to alter the records; believ
ing that such action on my part and on
that of other officers would not only tend
to destroy their historical accuracy and
value; and second, because subsequent
events closely connected with my report
and my record would be; without proper
explanation.
"I preferred charges against Lieutenant
Colonel Corbin based upon the information
I had received and believed to be correct,
and on these charges he was brought to
trial by a court-martial, which, however,
acquitted him._.
"Subsequently he united with others and
preferred charges against me on which I
was brought to trial. The findings of the
court-martial- were set sside. I was given
the â¢ command of a brigade by the per
sonal act of Governor Thomas, .was sub
sequently promoted by. the President as
brevet brigadier general and was con
firmed by the Senate. In August, 1865, the
war being over, I left the service. Lieu
tenant Colonel Corbln became Colonel of
the regiment, and, if â¢ I mistake not. he
has remained continuously in the. army
from that time to the present, a period of
nearly, thirty-five years. 'â¢ " ' >â¢&
" "I regret that any one has seen fit to
bring up this matter, for I am of the opin
ion that the Nashville Incident ought not
at" this time to have weight in determine
ing the question as to whether the.ad
jutant general of the army should be
made major general. Corbin and I were
at that time very .young volunteer offi
cers, with, but little experience in either
life or service, and it seems to me that
neither his act- as a soldier nor mine
as a commanding officer ought " to be
judged in the "severe military standard of
the regular army.' I believed at that ti?ne
that Colonel Corbin had betrayed cow
ardice so reported and felt it my duty
to court-martial him. But the Judgment
of the court did not sustain me. and the
incident should be regarded as closed. -
"The question whether the adjutant
general of the army should be a major
general is one to be determined by ex
perts and ' I do not feel called upon at
the present time to pass any opinion upon
it My object in writing this communca
tion Is to state facts as they occurred, so
as to remove from the public mind many
misapprehensions and ,- misunderstand
ings. -. ;Â¦. __________i__^_ ;, - 'Â¦Â¦ "..,.

PREPARATION OF THE
NEW LICENSE ORDERS
Merchants' Association Bepresenta-
tives Confer With the Super
visors' Committee.
,'A deputation from the Merchants' Asso
ciation was present at yesterday's meet
ing of the Supervisors', License and j Or
ders Committee for the purpose of Inter
preting correctly the provision of the
charter which states that no license taxes
shall be imposed upon any person who at
any fixed place. of business sells or manu
factures goods, wares or merchandise ex
cept such as (require permits from the Po
lice Commission. -Â¦
The object of the conference was to de
termine who should and who should not
pay a license under the ordinances to bÂ«
drafted by the Supervisors. -It was - the
consensus of opinion that resident agents
of concerns whose place of business is in
other States are exempt from, the charter
provision. Inasmuch as the interstate com
merce law regulates that branch of com
merce. Slaughterers of cattle are also
exempted, as are also restaurant-keepers
who do not sell wine with their meals, tt
was decided to grade the restaurants Into
three classes. Tax Collector Scott was
present at the meeting and reported the
results so far obtained In the preparation
of the new ordinances. :

RELIGIOUS LORE
THE TRUE BASIS
OF EDUCATION
Father Yorke Said Intel
lectual Training Alone
Does Not Suffice.
Crime in United States Steadily In
creasing Notwithstanding Very
Small Percentage ' of
Illiteracy.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke's theme at St.
Mary's Cathedral last evening was "Edu
cation." The keynote of the discourse
was his statement that the highest pro
duct of education is the true Christian
character that is able to withstand temp
tations. The mere teaching of reading,
writing and aritmetic was not sufficient to
establish morality. In fact, while the per
centage of illiteracy ln the United States
was infmiteslmally small, crime was on
the Increase. Statistics derived from San
Quentin and other penitentiaries Indicate
that the majority of criminals were edu
cated; that they at least could read and
write. It had once been said that when
the people were intelligent they would re
frain from crime. Vast sums had been
expended on the public school system;
vast tracta of land had been given; the
generous hands of the living and the es
tates of the dead were constantly enrich
ing educational institutions. Had the trial
of making men moral by the public
schools bten a success? His answer waa
in the negative. . *
Living right would be easy If there was
only one way to put pictures before tho
soul; if only the Intellect was the agen
cy. .Unfortunately the senses also zug
gested. No man did anything unless he
thought that he saw good in It.
Theft was committed because men
thought they would profit thereby. Man
should be led from admiring the iower
good to admire the higher good. Men sur
rendered some of their liberty to society
A man might like llmburger cheese and
onions, but society compelled him to sur
render his liberty in that direction. Men
were always trying to get around laws,
not necessarily for the profit, but. to re
gain some of their natural liberty.
If education meant anything, it meant
that a child should be brought up with
a' good strong character. The remedy for
crime would be found ln the proper re
ligious education of the child. A man
might steal a loaf of bread and go to San
Quentin; but. If he stole a railroad, era
bank or several millions of dollars, he
PATHETIC SCENE IN
THE CITY PRISON
Mrs. Nellie^Sanders, After Five Years'
Separation' From Her Son, Finds
Him in a Felon's Cell.
PATHETIC scene occurred In the City Prison yesterday, afternoon when
/L\ Â«Â¦ mother embraced her son for the flrsUtlme In five years and to her
It 1\ sorrow found that he was 1 charged with the crime of burglary^ The boy
is Frank Hazard, 17 years of age. He was arrested Tuesday afternoon,
together with William Ballard and James Curran, and -charged ,wlth break
ing into the toolhouse of John Kelso, - contractor, Sixteenth and Harrison
streets. â¢' â¢-.- ''.'.. ''.;Â¦-.'Â¦Â¦. .â¢:/-Â¦ ...
Mrs. Nellie Sanders, 319 Folsom street, saw an account of the arrest in the
newspapers and it struck her that the Hazard boy might be her son. She was
divorced from her husband, James Hazard,, five years ago and has since mar :
rled again. The father got the custody of the boy, on his promise that he
would educate him and care for him properly, and] the mother had lost all
trace of him. Accompanied by her mother; Mrs.' Dehmah; she went to Judge
Mogan's court yesterday and at once recognized her'son ln the dock. She al
most fainted and had to be led out of court. . .
In the afternoon Mrs. Sanders called at the prison with. her motherland
when the boy was brought from his cell she threw her arms around his neck
and wept bitterly. He did not know her and received ;her embraces â¢ with a
cool Indifference that almost broke her heart. He told her after. she became
calmer that he had been living with his pther grandmother. Mrs. Jane Hazard,
at Twelfth and Howard streets, and soothed her bx telling her that he was In
nocent of the crime charged against him. He said he had been asked by the other
two boys to go with ' them, but he : dld not; know what -they, intended doing-.
Mrs. Saunders declared that she .would stick to him till he got out of bis trouble
and then she would take him home with her and look after him ln the future).

would not come from behind the table he
was sitting at," went on the stalwart
youth, "or else I might have forgotten
now strong I am and how feeble he is.
He didn't say a word in answer to me,
and that is really all there Is to the
story."
Mizner explained his side of the salivary
battle with a minute regard for detail.
He traced the "feeling" that led to the
flnal meeting away back three months
ago. when he met the social leader face
to face ln the dining-room of a Los An
geles hotel.
"I was drinking wine of the Widow
Clicquot," he said, "and Greenway was
drinking wine â the kind he sells. That
my bottle did not have a Mumm label set
him off, and then and there I believe he
vowed to be revenged upon me."
According to the tale. Greenway's re
venge was of a sort that broke out In
termittently in sneering remarks such as
would wound the feelings of any wine
drinking gentleman. Finally Miiner came
to the conclusion that a man with a long
line of Irish ancestors could not endure
such calumny, and he decided he would

TOLD HER HE
HAD TAKEN A
SECOND WIFE
Mrs. Hobbose Says Fair In
formed Her of His
Marriage.
Did Not Tell Her the Name of the
Bride, but Said She Was Prin
. cipal of a Mission
School. â¢
Â» Â¦ .
' The Craven-Fair attorneys sprung a big
surprise yesterday morning by introduc
ing an entirely new and unexpected wit
ness, whose testimony, if not impeached,
will materially strengthen the case of the
alleged widow of the dead millionaire.
The. new â¢Â¦witness is a woman plain of
feature and small of stature, and the im
portance of her testimony lies not so
much ln what she said as in the manner
of .saying it, her apparent sincerity and
simple straightforwardness.
â¢ The name of the new witness Is Mrs.
Julia Hobbose and she resides on the
other side of the bay, in the little town
of San Pablo. Five, minutes after she
took the' stand to tell what she knew
about the alleged marriage of the late
Senator to the school teacher, the lan
guid indifference of the attorneys for the
opposition . bepame suddenly >, transformed
into the most intense interest, while the
crowd of spectators in the courtroom
braced up and, smacking their lips in an
ticipation, craned their necks to catch all
that was said. .
Mrs. Hobbose said she first met Senator
Fair in 1892. when she was living at 217
Seventeenth street.
"How did Fair happen to call upon
you?", asked Attorney Charles Pence.
Asked Fair for Aid:
"My husband . died in 1592," said Mrs.
Hobbose, "from injuries received in the
employment of Senator Fair. In my
struggle to support my children I became
very poor and was forced to seek outside
aid. I wrote .to Senator Fair, inclosing a
photograph of my children, and asking
him for assistance. He came to the house
in answer to my letter and questioned me
about my condition. I. told him how poor
I was and of the Illness of my oldest son.
He gave me $35, which I was to use In
sending my son Into the country." i
"Can you fix the date of the Senator's
visit?"
"Not exactly, but It was about May 20,
1892. I have a letter from my son. dated
May 20, 1892, and it was about that time
that Fair called upon me. I left the house
on Seventeenth street on June 10."
At 'the time of Senator Fair's second
visit he asked her how much money she
had received since her husband's death,
and she toid him she had received from
his lawyers the sum of $350. After talk-
Ing about the children the conversation
drifted to the subject of marriage.
"Senator Fair asked me why I did not
marry again. I replied that I did not be
lieve in second marriages, and that if x
did desire to marry I could not get a
husband of means. To my statement
Fair replied that I was mistaken about
the value of second marriages. *I have
Just married a second time,' he said, 'and
I have obtained a good woman. She is
neither young nor handsome, but she is
kind and charitable. She has more char
ity In her than have all the churches In
San Francisco." . , .
"Did he mention the name of his second
wife?" r ' Â¦'â¢ Â¦
"No, but he said she was principal of a
school in the Mission. â¢She Works as hard
as you do,' said he. 'but In a different
way. She has been a teacher for years.' '
This ended the direct examination and
the witness was handed over to the tender
mercies of Attorney Pierson, representing
"Did you ever visit Senator Fair In re
gard to your husband's death?"
"No, I never saw him until he camÂ© to
"""Do you know" the date of his visit?"
"It was about June 10, 1592."
"How do you fix the date?"
"By a letter which I received from my
son I had sent him to La Honda. San
Mateo County, for his health, and this
was the first letter I received from him.'
"Where is that letter now?"
"T. D. Riordan. my cousin, has it."
Biordan Is Disinterested.
"Is Mr. Riordan employed by Mrs.
Cr&vcri ?* ' Â¦ . . * * *
Pence took occasion to. interrupt Pier
son's examination to say that Riordan is
not employed Ln Mrs. Craven's cause.
"Riordan is just a friend," he said, "and
nothing more. He has all Mrs. Hobbose's
correspondence and will produce itwhen
nÂ£c c s ti r\ r
It was then agreed that Riordan should
produce any papers bearing upon the case
at 2 o'clock. In return for this courtesy
Pierson consented to have Fair's effects
examined. In the hope of discovering the
photograph and letters sent by Mrs. Hob
bose to Fair.
A recess was taken at this point until 2
p. m., but at that hour Attorney Pierson
had not- arrived. At 3 p. m. Attorney

MARINE ENGINEER
BAIL'S HARD LUCK
Claims He Was Robbed by His Wife
and Afterward Arrested
for Assault. .
i Emll F. Ball, first assistant engineer of
the steamer Alcazar, Is in a peck of
trouble. Ball, who Is a cripple, has been
separated from his wife for several years,
but Mrs. Bail has not yet got over the
habit of collecting her husband's wages,
and he says she is invariably on hand on
pay day to relieve him of a portion of his
earnings. - '-â¢ ' .- Â¦
Yesterday, however, Ball secured his
month's wages before his wife hove in
sight. His joy was short lived, however.
Mrs. Bail overhauled him on Main-street
wharf and proceeded, to collect. She waa
accompanied by her mother and a male
friend, and while the latter held her hus
band, so he claims, she went through his
pockets, taking every cent she could find.
Yesterday afternoon Â¦ Ball went to the
house of his brother-in-law, Frank
Donnelly, at 47S Tehama street, and
demanded his wife. Donnelly denied that
she was there and there was a mix-up.
Bail pulled a revolver and threatened to
kill Donnelly.' He was - flourishing the
weapon when Policeman Rlordan ap
peared and arrested him for assault with
a deadly weapon. Bail had a lacerated
wound in his scalp, which was dressed at
the Receiving Hospital
Pierson had not finished his search for the
letters and requested more time. There
was no objection and the case went over
until 10:30 o'clock to-day.

and Curious.
Devout Christians and the curious again

words of the Gospel as Interpreted by the

ing his> hearers to closely follow his ser
mon Master Cooke held the attention of
the congregation for some time with a
general discussion of Christianity and its
many sects and . creeds. He then an
nounced that he was ready to answer pll
Questions that might be asked. In answer
to a question he said there was no doubt
but that there was punishment for the
evils of this world in the life to come.
If fire in fact did not await the sinners
fire of m-ind did await them, he said, for
each misdeed in this world must be paid
for in the hereafter.
After passing over various theories of
the future life and the meaning of various
verses in' the Scriptures the boy preacher
caused some discussion by saying that if
Go.d murder It is no murder, for there is

enough to sin. Rev. Mr. Cooke, the lad's
father, addressed the congregation and
told how his conversion had been wrought

Bible, and that It was the spoken word
of God and must be obeyed. The father

MIZNER IS SORRY FOR
"POOR OLD GREENWAY"
SOCIETY waited all yesterday with
bated breath for the report of the
gun or the clank of the sword that
would make Greenway a- self
avenger and "Addle" Mizner a handsome
corpse. But there were no fearful sounds
to disturb the Lenten quiet. Greenway
went around explaining to his friends,
"Why, lon't you know there Is absolutely
no truth in the report thar Mizner vented
his spite In my beer. We're the best of
friends, don't you know."
And Mizner â well, he Just smiled a su
perior smile and gave out the Information
that he was a "gentleman."
"Two negatives make, an affirmative."
Therefore, In spite of the Greenway and
Mizner "noes," the fact must remain that
Greenway's malt beverage was diluted by
the Mizner saliva.
According to Mizner, It has been a long
standing, feud that finally resulted in the
wet and bloodless encounter. :It Is a sad
story, for it owes its. origin to a wine
bottle and ends ignomlnlously'in a beer
glass.
"I'm first of all a gentleman," said Ad
die Mizner, "so I must really deny that
I spat in Greenway's beer. We Just met
at a downtown cafe and I went ' over to
Greenway and told him that he had better

table and asked him to step aside for a
moment with me. 'Why. what is the use.
Addle.' he said, with a great show of hyp.
ocritical cordiality. Â¦ 'Sit down rigV
here.' " \ Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦Â¦
But Addle did not sit down. He called
to the leader and said: "You have been
passing slurring remarks about me and
if you don't stop I'll knock the liver and
lights out of you. I'll do it right now, too,
of you only give me a chance and come
out from behind that table."
But no Greenway came to meet_ the
Mizner fist, and so instead of any blood
being spilt, a mouthful of saliva spoileit
a good glass of beer. â M .
After reading the cold bare facts of the
battle yesterday, Mizner was in a repen
tent mood.
"Poor old Greenway." he said. Im
really sorry for him. He is 'dotty' and I
would not be surprised to hear In a week
or so that he was working in a nut fac
tory. Come to think of It." he muaed,
"I don't believe I really would have
smashed him. But this holds good if he
talks of.'me againâ l'll spank him."
While Mizner was pitying the "ex
leader," Greenway was positively declar
ing that he knew -nothing whatsoever
about an encounter Saturday or any other
time between Mizner and himself.
"We are good friends," he said. "There
Is no 111-feeling between us, and this talk
about a 'spat' is all bosh."

MERCHANTS ASK
FOR CHANGES IN
PAVING ORDERS
Present Specifications for
Street Work Too
Narrow.
Valuable Suggestions Are Made as to
Several Kinds of Material That
May Be Used to Great
Advantage.
The Merchants* Association has sent to
the Board of Public Works an Interesting
communication, sugrgestine the advisabil
ity of revising the present specifications
so that streets paved with material that
has been tested and proven a success in
ether cities may be accepted.
Some time ago the association's superin
tendent. L. M. Kins, went on a tour of
observation through the Eastern cities.
Â¦with the view of obtaining all possible
data en the cubjeot. It was on* the
strength of Mr. King's investigation that
the foliowlr.g irleas and suggestions .have
been given to the Board of. Public Works*
FlrMâ That there are In use. In Eastern
rlt!eÂ« several pavement* not In use in ban
Francisco and that these pavement* have been
thoroughly tested oiid provrn satisfactory-
Secondâ That In cities where these pa\ - ements
are used the pavements in general are :nuch
superior to the pavements In San Francisco
at present.
Thlrd-That on heavily traveled streets th?
â¢tone block pavements are now almost uni
versally laid on concrete foundations and tne
Joints grouted with asphaltlc compositions and
that on street* subjected to extra * h"?avy
traffic such pavements are generally used in
preference to all others.
Fourthâ That In addition to the above pave
ment asphalt and vitrified brick are the pave
ments In moil ceneral use and that both of
these pavements have been lone used and
thoroughly tested and found satisfactory.
Fifthâ That among all the pavements in Ã¼bo
asphalt is the cne most generally used wnea
new pavements are laid, except on streets hav
ing too much grade or subjected to extra heavy
draying.
Sixthâ That for business streets or other
streets subjected to much traffic and requiring
a smooth and noiseless pavement asphalt Is
much sui>erior to the bituminous rock pave
ments used in San Francisco.
Seventhâ That for streets requiring a smooth
pavement, but not an entirely noiseless one.
and not subjected to heavy draylng, vrtrifiÂ»d
brick on a concrete foundation Is one of the
most desirable pavements.
Eighth â While modern wooden block pave
ments are not in general use in the principal
Eastern cities Inspected, asphalt and vitrified
brick being preferred, our information Is that
Â«uch pavements when properly laid are being
Â«urce*i>fuUy used In Southern cities, an! it is
a well-known fact that they are largely used
in Paris. London and other Europ^ar. cities.
Fuch pavements are noiseless and nou-Eliniwry
and therefore desirable in some locations. They
require, however, great care In laying. WÂ»
believe, however, that if citizens deiiro these
psvements they should be permitted to lay
thÂ»-m. provided they are laid under guarantees
of not less than ten (10) years.
The association urges that in the prep
aration of new specifications that they
shall include asphalt, vitrified brick, small
basalt blocks and wooden blocks on con
crete foundations, and that all of these
pavements when laid en accepted streets
Fhall be guaranteed by the contractors for
ten years and Fuitable bonds be given for
security, adding: Ten-year guarantees are
now generally exacted in modern cities,
and it is the opinion of Eastern city offi
cials that a lon^ term guarantee is a more
certain way of scouring good pavement 3
than the most rigid inspection.
