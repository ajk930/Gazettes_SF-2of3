LONDON. March 24.â Mafeking*s fate
absorbs most of the public Interest
in the war. Four dispatches treat
ing on various columns have been
received. It is plain so far as the
Rhcxiesian force under Plumer is con
cerned that the town of Mafeking is al
most a* far from relief as ever. Com
mandant Snyxnan struck the main body
cf Plunder's force on Saturday. An ar
tillery duel occupied the greater part of
the day and the ultimate result seems to
heve been the retirement of the British
commander under cover of night to either
Ga.berones or Crocodile Pools, twice as
far away from Maf eking aÂ«Â» he was be
fore. Probably by now Commandant Sny
man is bark at his old positions around
Colonel Baden-Powell's garrison,- which,
by the way, has established an ordnance
factory of its own and with its 'own home
made howitzers Is now abie to throw
home-made shells with home-made
powder.
Lemlsch have telegraphed to the Premier,
Dr. yon Koerbe, demanding that he take
steps to stop the exportation of forty
five cannon, which are said to have left
the Skoda factory. Bohemia, on their way

ATTACKS OF BOERS
ON BLUMER'S FORCE
LONDON. March 23. 9:20 p." m.â The War
Office has issued the following: Â¦' 'i
"From the general at Cape Town to the
Secretary of War:
"CAPE TOWN, March 2S.â The follow
ing telegram has arrived from Nichoisen,
Buluwayo. March 16:
" 'LOBATSI. March 14.â The Boers ad
vanced from the south In considerable
force this morning. They first advance.l
Whether the B<ws will be left much
longer undisturbed depends on the move
ments of the flying column moving from
the south. It Is difficult to understand
the precise nature of the operations from
that direction or the extent of progress
of this force.
According to one telegram the Mafek
lng relief force has not yet started from
Kimbericy. .but this probably refers to
a large and substantial force in charge
of a convoy of provisions ;inri other neces
saries for the besieged town.
A mobile column probably consisting of
mounted men. with a few serviceable
gunp. is Fupposed to have started thres
weeks ago. Unless it hajÂ» met with more
difficulties than were expected It must by
this time be approaching Its goal.
Rumors were current In London all day
yesterday that Mafekinj? had been re
lieved from the south, but this did not
receive official confirmation. From the
southern part of the Orange Free State
comes news that dieposes of the Boer
Ptory of the capture of General Gatacre
and his staff. The forces of Generals
Clements and Gatacre joined hands on
Thursday a( Donkers Poort, which Is ten.
or twelve miles from Norvals Pont and
txbout twenty-five miles from Springfon
tein. The rumor current in the Kroon
rtad camp that Commandant Olivier had
fought a successful battle near Bethulie
â¢was two days earlier.
If reports from Boer sources can be re
lied on Presidents Kruger and Steyn are
disputing whether the Transvaal has an
nexed the Free State or not. Apparently
the Boers are finding employment In in
venting romances. President Kruger's
alleged proclamation stating that the
Russians had captured London and pro
claimed it the territory of the Czar af
forded no end of amusement in . London
yesterday and will not soon be forgotten.

' ' slnarionof' William Goebel, began
to-day. before Judge Moore. The Court
house was guarded inside and out by
militia and scares of deputy sheriffs
armed with Winchester rifles to prevent
possible interference from mountaineers;
who were reported on their way to
Frankfort, but their presence was' un
necessary, as the mountaineers failed to
appear and no disorder occurred.
The witnesses, to-day included Warden
Eph Lillard. Detective Armstrong, Sheriff
Bosworth of.Fayette County, who arrest
ed Secretary Powers and Captain. John
Davis, and Silas Jones, who is now under
bonds, charged .with . complicity In the
murder. The testimony tended to show
that the shots -came, from that section of
the executive building In which Secretary
Powers' offlce Is located,'- although no one
swore that the: shots were from the Sec
retary's office.. . .. , â¢
The strongest -evidence perhaps .was

took place.* There v/ere many in Â¦ there

the shots wnre, fired- he walked into' 1 the
anteroom, where he saw Captain Davis
and Governor Taylor -among others. There
was considerable, txcltemf.nt. Governor
Taylor came to the door and wanted to
know who was shot.

"Did you see- any one try. to; open Caleb

said to-night that eufÃcieni. -evidence had

Court, Counsel and Spectators Deeply Moved
by an Incident in the Trial of the
Alleged Poisoner.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
HASTINGS. Nebr., March 23.â The
State to-day rested and the Intro
duction of testimony in the de
fense of Miss Viola Horlocker, on
trial for sending poisoned candy
to Mrs. Morey, commenced. One witness
was called to show that the woman seen
In the flat about the time the candy was
left there was not Miss Horlocker. The
succeeding witnesses ' were questioned as
to her inheritance of insanity from her
mother and her attorney said it would be
shown by testimony that she was insane
at the time the crime was alleged to have
been committed and is at the present
time. Â¦ C-vl:-'
One of the most exciting incidents of
the trial occurred this afternoon when a
number of Hastings women rushed up to
Miss Horlocker and showered kisses upon
her. The fair, defendant was almost over
come by this unexpected demonstration
and the court, counsel and spectators were
deeply moved.
The love affairs of Lawyer Charles F.
Morey and Miss Horlocker were described
on the witness stand this afternoon by
Miss Eva Stewart, an intimate friend of
Miss Horlocker. Miss Stewart testified
that Viola had come to her and said she
had something to confess. She then went
on to tell how Morey made his first ad
vances to her in the office after the others
had gone home. He was sad and lonely,
he said, and wanted a friend. Viola
promised to assume the role, and things
progressed so rapidly tnat on a certain
occasion, when Morey was soothing her
headache with hypnotism, a little door in
her heart flew open and she experienced a
feeling never before entertained for a
man. After that she was frequently in
his company and everything went as hap
pily as a marriage bell until Mrs. Morey
took a hand. Then Morey told Viola that
he must be faithful to his wife and that
she (Viola) must regard him only as a
friend. This caused her much grief, but
the attachment was finally broken off.

gold-bearing bed of the sea' at or in the
vicinity of Cape..Nonle, or. ln other Alas
kan waters, have been made by the Secre
tary of War or any other official of the
War Department, but that permits have
been given, under. the navigation act of
March 3, 1899, to excavate or dredge for
gold at yolnts j where there can be no
hindrance to navigation. He states that
prospectors must secure such permits to
avoid liability to heavy fines under the
act.- The Secretary adds:, â¢ Â¦".t-fv^-
As this statute was designed solely for the
protection of navigation, It has been the prac
tice of the War Department to grant permits
to persons desiring to excavate for any purpose
when the work is not such as .to injuriously
affect navigation and is; otherwise lawful... Per
mitÃ thus granted are not exclusive; they do
not preclude . any number- of .similar permits
applicable- to the same territory; they are not
grants or concessions and they confer no rights
whatever, except Immunity. from prosecution
under the statute. - '
No Application Denied.
As there seems to be no legal reason why all
citizens of the United States should not have
the same opportunity to prospect for gold and
acquire mining rights under the mining laws
upon land under water as they have upon lands
not under water, the department determined
as a general policy In the exercise of the discre
tion of the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of
"War by thts statute to relieve all citizens apply
ing from the obstacle interposed by this statute
as* long as their proposed operations do not in
fact Interfere with navigation. 'All applications
made under this statute have, accordingly, so
far as it^ has been possible to dispose of them,
received favorable action. No application of
this description has been denied. Upon two
permits have been granted. .Upon a third papers
had been prepared and were awaiting the Sec
retary of War's signature at. the time of the
passage of your resolution. Three others were
approved by the Chief of Engineers and were
In the hands of the Judge Advocate General for
the preparation of the necessary papers. Eleven
others are still -In the office of the Chief of
Engineers In process of examination ui>on the
question whether they -interfere with naviga
tion. Four more Just received are in the of nee
ot the Secretary of .War will to-day be sent
to the Chief of Engineers.
Unless otherwise directed by Congress the
Secretary of ' War will deem It his duty la the
exercise of the discretion vested In him by law
to erant permits In all of these cases and upon
all other similar applications by citizens of the
United States, provided that the proposed work
does not affect navigation.

NEGRO PRISONER
THREATENED BY
VIRGINIA MOB
Is Under Arrest for the
Murder of Two Men
at Skippers.
Militiamen Guard the Jail and the
Authorities Hope to Avoid the
Threatened Lynching, hut the
Troops May Be Attacked.
RICHMOND, Va., March 24.â Since
early yesterday (Friday) afternoon the
Governor of Virginia and the peace offi
cers of Emporia have been temporizing
with a mob which threatens to lynch a
negro prisoner. The militia has been or
dered Into action and withdrawn three
times in less than twenty-four hours.
The negro who, with a white man, killed
Justice of the Peace Saunders and Mr.
Welton at Skippers, on Thursday, was,
after ah all-night chase, captured on Fri
day at Stoney Creek, Sussex County. He
confessed to the shooting of Saunders and
"VVelton and to several robberies. He Is
the notorious negro Cotton, who escaped
from the Portsmouth, Va., Jail some
months ago white under sentence of
death.
A crowd gathered at Emporia, the coun
ty seat, bent on lynching Cotton upon hU
arrival. Judge Goodwin wired the Gov
ernor a request for troops, and the Gov
ernor promptly ordered Company )i, the
Richmond Blues, to report at the Coast
Line depot, where a special- had been pe
cured. ' Later the Governor received from
the Judge a telegram stating that his
life was in danger if the troops were. sent.
The Governor asked if he must construe
this as a withdrawal of the request, but
subsequently the Sheriff's indorsemeni
came and the troops ' were dispatched.
They arrived at the- scene early Friday
afternoon and surrounded the Jail.
At 9 o'clock last night It was reported
to the Judge that if the troops remained
at Emporia the mob would attack thorn.
It was then agreed that the Sheriff should
order the troops back, and a local guard
be placed at the jail, the crowd agreeing
that the law should take its course.
At 11 o'clock the Jail was in charge of
the local guard? and the military were
quartered: in^ the courthouse. It was re
ported, however, that a mob was ap
proaching from Pleasant Hill and another
from along the Atlantic and Danville
Railway. , â¢:
At 1:40 a. m. the military were again
called upon to take charge of the jail. It
being reported that a lynching mob was
forming on the edge of the town. Major
Cutchins has wired the Governor for an
other company. .
A second , company of the Bluos was
accordingly ordered to Emporia and a
lynching now seems improbable.
WILL ATTEMPT
TO PASS THE
TARIFF BILL
Friends of the Porto Rican
Measure Fix Upon a
Programme.
Decide to Force Early Action and, if
Possible, to Vote Down All
Proposed Amend
ments;
WASHINGTON, March 23.â The Repub
lican caucus committee of the Senate to
day authorized Senator Foraker In definite
terms to postpone the separation of the
tariff feature from the Porto Rican gov
ernmental bill and to attempt to pass the
House.tariff bill without amendment. The
programme is to vote down all amend
ments, If possible to do so, and pass the
bill as it came from the House without
any changes whatever.
The element In the Republican ranks in
the Senate favoring free trade with Porto
Rico decided at a conference to-day to
oppose any action looking to an early vote
and to ask for further time in case the
question should come up.
During the conference the committee
went over the situation In detail, consid
ering all the points at issue. There were
suggestions as to the necessity of amend
ing the bill so as to suit the demands of
the Republican free trade element, but
these were considered as more than offset
by the situation In the House and the
necessity of maintaining the party tariff
principle. ; .
The opinion was strongly expressed that
any changes whatever in the House bill
would endanger Its acceptance by that
body, and In the end this fact controlled
the committee's decision. There was,
however, a disposition manifested to pla
cate the free traders. by making various
amendments to the governmental bill.
The tariff advocates have gone so far as
to draft amendments to that measure,
which are 1 intended to correct adminis
trative defects in the House bill and also
to meet many objections to the House
tariff measures. One of these amend
ments looks to the ' enlargement of the
free trade list so as to include most of the
articles of export In which the - constit
uents of the free trade Senators are in
terested.- There is also a proposition look
ing to the entire removal of the duty on
articles in the United States going into
Porto Rico. â¢ " Â¦
Free, Traders.
The action . of the conference was soon
made known to the free traders, and It
soon became evident that they were not
satisfied with the situation. A hurried
conference was called In Senator Proc
tor's committee room, which was attend
ed by about ten Senators. These included
not only the iron-bound free traders, but
others who have not yet taken a decided
position against all Porto Rico tariff prop
ositions. . They did not enter Into any de
tailed discussion df the proposition of the
steering committee, but contended them
selves with' a determination to oppose any
proposition looking to the fixing of a time
to vote on either the House tariff bill or
the Senate governmental bill. They. were
unanimously -of the â¢ opinion that delay
meant gain for the cause In the public
good will and In the Senate. A canvass of
the Republican . Senators was made with
the result. , it was said, that fifteen . could
be found who would oppose hasty action.
Of those; it was said, ten were unalterably
opposed -to Â¦Â¦Â¦ aâ¢Â¦ tariff ~on commerce- with
Porto Rico. -It was asserted explicitly
that the proposition made yesterday : . by
Senator Proctor on behalf of the free
traders for a vote next Wednesday would
not be renewed.
When the Senate adjourned several of
the members of the Republican caucus
committee admitted that no great prog
ress had been made. They said there
would be no withdrawal from the deter
mination to press for an early vote, and
to put the House bill through without
amendment. Other members, "however,
expressed the opinion that the bill might
yet 'be modified so as to meet the objec
tions of the free trade Republicans of the
Senate. They admitted that the Repre
sentatives of the House had told them
there was great danger In altering the
House measure In any respect.

Idaho's Governor Takes Upon His
Own Shoulders the Full Blame
for General Jderriam's
Course.
WASHINGTON, March 23.â Governor
Steunenberg of Idaho continued his.testi
mony in the Coeur d'Alene investigation
to-day, being cross-examined by F. C
Robertson, attorney for those prosecuting
the charges. The Governor said that if
any arrests were made prior to the is
suance of his proclamation it was with
his authorization and approval and be
cause of his general authority as chief
executive of the State. Before General
Merriam went to the scene of disorder
the Governor had a talk with' him and
told him to take such steps as were neces
sary to maintain -order. â¢ When further
questioned as to just who was responsible
for arrests Governor Steunenberg said:
"I assume responsibility for every ar
rest made In Shoshone County by Gen
tral Merriam or any one else."
He was asked if he assumed this re
sponsibility in the case of a man brought
from Montana and amounting, it was al
leged, to "kidnaping." Governor Steunen
berg answered that if it amounted to that
he assumed responsibility, for that.
Chairman Hull at this point said that
he had received a letter, from Adjutant
General Corbin saying that the War De
partment was not in possession of the
official rolls of prisoners.
The Governor went on to testify that he
assumed responsibility for any - arrests
made by deputies outside the State, al
though he did not claim authority beyond
the State. He did not know that his dep
uties made these arrests, but if they did
he was the responsible official.
Robertson asked if the regular prison
in which the Federal prisoners were con
fined was not at Moscow, Idaho. The
Governor did not know of this; the use of
the stockade, or "bull-pen." was not the
result of any specific order, but was due
to the requirements of the occasion; Â¦
I Instituted the Permit System.
When asked if he was consulted aa to
instituting the "permit- system" Gover
nor Steunenberg said Attorney. General
Hays reported to him that, after consult
ing with mine owners and citizens in the
Coeur d'Alene district ho had found evi
dence of a conspiracy dating back several
years and that he had accordingly writ
ten out a proclamation forbidding mine
owners from employing men* belonging to
an organization believed to be criminal.
The previous testimony had shown that
the Governor approved the course of Lieu
tenant Lyons in putting union men at
work at the Tlger-Poorman mine. Tho
Governor said he did not consider this a
violation of his own proclamation, as the
case was exceptional and the mine was In
danger of being flooded. He reserved the
right to act aa circumstances required.
DEMANDS CESSATION
OF MARTIAL LAW
WASHINGTON, March 23.â Senator
Allen In" the Senate and Representative
Lentz In the House to-day introduced a
Joint resolution setting; forth the con
tinued maintenance of martial law In the
Coeur d'Alene mining country and closing
with the following:
Be It resolved. That the further use of the
troops of the United States . In aiding or as
sisting in the maintenance of martial law
within the said county of Khoshone la Im
proper, unnecessary and unlawlul, r.nd that
the President of the United States be request
ed forthwith to withdraw said troops now In
Shoshone County, unless the said permit'sys
tem be forthwith immediately revoked, the
writ of habeas corpus restored to the citizens
of said county and martial law declared to be
at an end.
Be it further resolved. That the sense and
purpose of this resolution is in no wise to
influence the President of the United States
in maintaining and keeping said troops within
the limits of said county of Shoshone to aid
the proper officers in the execution of the
civil law therein.
The resolution is preceded by a long
recital of the alleged improper conditions
existing, in part as follows: . .-â¢Â¦-.
Whereas. At all times since the 3d day of
May, 1898, the county of Shoshone has been
In a state of peace and not of. war, â¢ nor Inva
sion nor Insurrection, nor rebellion: and,
whereas., it Is not within the rower or author
ity of the Governor of Idaho or the President
of the United States In a time of peace to con
tinue martial law on account of any fictitious
necessity; and. whereas. In , violation of tho
fourteenth amendment of the constitution, : cit
izens have been arrested -without due process
of law and held for Indefinite periods at the
will of the authorities claiming .to exercise
martial law in said county, without any Judi
cial process of legal warrant; and, whereas,
the form of commitment and warrant of ,; ar
rest Is a revival of the infamous system of
lettres de cachet, by which Innocent citizens
were arbitrarily arrested and held during the
reign of Louts XIV of France- and -his des
potic minister, resulting In the I revolution: of
the people against such despotic tyranny, 'and
the same Is but a repetition of the unlawful
arrests made under the warrant of the early
kings of Enerland,- abolished by the Bill 1 of
Rights and the Magna Charta, and such .War
rants are ' Illegal, unconstitutional and : - un
precedented In the United States and abhor
rent to all classes of citizens, etc.
House to-day was one by Fitzgerald of
Massachusetts directing the Postmaster
General to exclude the book "Sapho" from
the mails. The preamble to the resolution
cays that an indictment has been fourd
against persons in the city of New York
connected with the play "Sapho" as being
immoral and against public decency, anÂ«l
that a publication bearing the same name,
"gapho," and detailing In lewd and lasciv
ious language the features of the play, is
published and sent through the mails of the
United States. The resolution then recitc3
the postal laws againt the carrying of
lascivious books, etc., in the mail, and di
rects the Postmaster General to take such
precautions as are necessary to prevent
the use of the mail for carrying this book.

PONCE, Porto Rico, March 23.â The sit

has been at any time before since the
terrible hurricane. In many places the
poor are starving. The prices of rice,
beans and codfish have increased from

stand the delay and they condemn all
Americans indiscriminately.
Bad feeling is arising which It will take
years to overcome. Even riots are threat

that he had been a bosom friend of the
decedent and that while together in San
Francisco they had spent days in carous

his idea, a habitual drunkard. The case
seems to hinge on the fact as to whether
or not a man addicted to the use of liquor,
with occasional excesses, can be of sound
and disposing mind.
SENATE VOTES
RELIEF FOR THE
PORTO RICANS
Conference Report Adopted
by Thirty-Five to
Fifteen.
Democratic Members of the Upper
House of Congress Solidly .
Arrayed Against the
Measure.
WASHINGTON. March 23.-The Sen
ate to-day adopted the conference report
on the Porto Rican relief bill by a vote
of 25 to 15, practically a strictly party ex
pression. No Democrat voted for the re
port, but Stewart of Nevada voted with
the Republicans. The time of discussion
was consumed mostly by Tillman, who
made a fierce attack on the measure, and
accused the Republican Senators and the
Republican party of indiscretion, hypoc
risy ajid "dirty work." His speech was
quite characteristic and was listened to
with interest by his colleagues on the
floor and the persons in the galleries.
Tinman sharply criticized the method
adopted by the United States of extend
ing handfuls of food to the people of
l'orto Rico as a gratuity.
"As long aa you continue to feed those
people down there," declared Tillman,
"yuu may feed 'them. So long aa the
freedmen'e bureau was maintained in the
South the colored race there attended to
nothing. That's a race characteristic.
This Government will set itself up as an
eleemosynary Institution by the passage
of this bill, and I do not believe we should
ttaiid en any such ground."
In response to an inquiry from Spooner,
Tillman said:
"I'm in favor of free trade with Porto
Rico. 1 don't believe In protecting one '.
part of the United States against an
other."
Perkins Versus Tillman.
Perkins of California inquired if Till
man was in favor of free trade with the
Philippines, knowing that those islands
had the advantage of peon and Malay
labor. Tillman r*-plied:
"If we are to continue to hold the
Philippines, I am in favor of free trade
Â¦with those islands. Those who voted to
bring into the country these islands, with
their cheap contiact, peon and Malay la
bor, were told of the results that would
lollow the ratification of the treaty. And
you could not get the votes necessary to
make that trtuty a law until you had
bought come men to vote for it. If it is
liow proposed to send a horde of carpet
baggers over there, backed by the bayo
nets of soldiers, to long as I have a voice
1 shall protest."
Referring to the recent speech of
Bc-veridge, Tillman declared It had been
distributed among the Filipinos and had
Infused new life and energy into the rev
olution, because it indicated the hypocrisy
and double dealing the United States had
resorted to in the treatment of the Fili
pinos.
Locking over at Allison, Tillman laugh
ingly Aiiluded to the resolution adopted by
the Legislature of lewa, "warning their
representatives in Congress." he said "of
the consequences of their action on the
pt-nding bill." It never rains but it
pours. The whole political structure is
tumbling about their ears.
Continuing. Tillman eaid: "I believe
that Mr. iicKinley is one of the most
lovable of men in public life, but the
trouble with him is that sometimes he has ,
not the backbone to stand up against his
party friends."
Disclaiming any authority to speak for
the President Perkins of California said
that the belief that the sugar trust had !
acquired the greater part of the sugar
product of Porto Rico and his desire to
build up the beet sugar industry' in the
United States had induced the President.
he believed, to favor a tariff if it were
true that he did favor It.
One Trust That Will Suffer.
Gallir.ger of New Hampshire, who is a
member of the Committee on Pacific
Islands and Porto Kico, said in that com
mittee there had been but one thought,
and that was to provide that which would
be best for the interests of the island and
Its inhabitants.
"Destitute and suffering as these peo
ple are." said Gallinger. "we ought to
pass this bill promptly and not deal in
cuch diatribes as we have been treated
to here."
Gallfnger declared that it was a familiar
cry that the trusts were controlling the
Republican administration.
"We heard that when Hawaii was an
nexed and free entry to our ports was
given to Hawaiian sugar. Now it is raised
again when we propose to place a small
duty upon the products of Porto Rico for
the benefit of the Porto Ricans them
telves.
"The trust which is suffering-." contin
ued Mr. Gallinger, "is a trust headed by
the British Vice Consul at San Juan. That
trust bought up the sugar under the full
Dir.gley rates and if they can get it into
this country free of duty they will make
the full hundred per cent of the tariff; but
if we succeed in putting a tariff duty of
33 iwr cent on the Dir.gley rate on that
njpar the trust's profits will be cut down,
by that much ar.d the people of Porto Rico
will benefit to that extent."
In the course of tho debate Tillman
said: "We had some dares here yester
day, but the bob-tailed flush of my friend
from Ohio (Foraker) did not go through."
(Laughter.)
Spooner protested against the making
of political speeches on measures like that
now pending. Having referred to the man
ner in which Tinman had characterized
thp work of the Republican Senate he and
Tillman beenmo involved in a controversy
ovfT the terms used by thÂ«Â» South Carolina
Senator, which developed considerable
heat and ended by Sponner paying that in
view of statements justifying ballot-bax
stuffing and thp employment of the shot
gun policy against the negroes of the
Bomb, he was "tired of hearing all this
prattlf from Senators on the othpr side
of the chamber about the rights of Porto
Ricans and the Filipinos. It ought to bÂ«
understood that the Senators on this side
of the chamber are as anxious to do the
riR-ht and .lust thing as are those on the
other Eid*."

My Li fem
Extreme cases of dis-
ease test the real value
of c Tnedidne. Many "tonic" and
"stimulant" preparations, which have
no real medicinal value, seem to brace
up the users when they are feeling
"played out." Any stimulant will do
this whether bought at the liquor store
or drug store. The true test of a med-
icine is v.-hen life itself is staked on its
remedial power. In hundreds of such
cases Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery has been the means of saving life
when even the "family doctor" had
pronounced sentence of death.
Â¦ I had been a great suSerer for several years,
aad mv faniilv doctor said I would not be a liv-
ing man in two years, but, thank God, I am still

any man. I cannot say too much for the benefit
I have received."
Many diseases, named for the organs
affected, as "heart disease," Â«lung dis-
ease," "liver complaint," etc, are per-
fectly cured by Dr. Pierces Golden Med-
ical Discovery, which cures through the
stomach diseases which originate in the

CHURCH ORGAN
AND FURNITURE
CARRIED AWAY
Bold and Successful Raid
of Two Washington
Thieves.
SPOKANE, "Wash.. March 23.â When the
sexton of the Norwegian Lutheran Church
went to prepare for the evening prayer
meeting this afternoon he found the room
barren of all furniture save the .* pulpit.
The chairs, pews, organ and even the
hymnbooks had disappeared. An Investi
gation led to a discovery of the missing
property in a second-hand store.
The dealer claims that two well-dressed,
dignified appearing, elderly men came to
his store a few days ago and told him that
the church was in financial distress and
needed to raise money quickly Â¦ to pay
taxes. They preferred -to sell the furni
ture rather than borrow. A bargain was
struck for all the seats and the organ for
$50. and the hymnbooks were i put 'ir. 'to
sweeten the trade. The! key was. given
the tradesman ?nd he removed the;furni
ture In the' afternoon, unmolested, al
though the -church- Is in the -heart of a
thickly populated portion of the city.; ..
The property was taken back to the
church amid the loud protests;/ of : the
pawnshop keeper, who claimed he had Ift
the money go out of pure ' charity. â¢ The
swindlers have not been apprehended and
the police can gather no clew from the de
scription furnished. Â¦ .Â¦ - . Â¦ . , .
Between 7:30 and 11 o'clock this moniln?
a bold thief entered the barroom of the
Park Hotel, Barker & Daniels, proprie
tors, extracted from a safe a sack con
taining $264 45 and made his escape with
out being heard or seen and without at
tracting the attention of several men en
gaged, in a game of cards In an adjolninar
room, not twenty feet from the safe The
robber evidently, knew the combination of
the safe, as he turned the dial back to
the proper place for throwing the bolts
before opening the door. The theft \va3
committed while Adolph Peters, the.bar
tender, was getting bottled goods from the

ONE of the most Important cap
tures of a ; crook to the credit of
the ; Police Department was made
yesterday afternoon by Detectives
Ryan and ODea ,of the south
ern district, Â¦; who were , specially . compli
mented by Chief Sullivan on their suc
cess. The prisoner is Robert Collins, alias
J. C. Collins, alias *W. Sweeney, alias
Henry Whittlng, alias W. Smith. He is
only 24 or 26 years of age, and began his
criminal career in 189 L He has been ar
rested several times for petty larceny and
burglary and now he is accused of being
a bank sneak thief. v" â¢
Collins is a native son and his uncle is
a section boss in the service of the Mar
ket-street Railroad Company. In ISSI he
was arrested once for petty | larceny and
once for burglary, and was sent to the
Whlttier School. January 3, 1594, he^y.as
arrested for petty larceny and got thirty
days in jail. A few. weeks later he was
arrested by Detective Ryan on three
charges of burglary. Through his uncles
Influence the charges were withdrawn and
he was sent away on a deep-water vessel.
He returned to the city and Was arrested
for i stealing some money Â¦ from the sale
In the office of the City Front stables on
Clay street. Three years ago this month,
while in- the dock in Judge Low's court
awaiting his preliminary examination, he
tore away one of the wooden slats around
the dock and . squeezing himself through
the hole made his escape. Â¦
He kept away from the city, but
returned about a: month ago and
it - is claimed i started operations by
robbing a saloon -on Third street.
' Then he^ looked after larger game,
and he and his partner are believed to
have stolen $400 about two weeks ago
from Ferdinand Smith, money broker. 316
Montgomery street. He and his partner
are supposed to have then made their
way to Seattle and stole between $3000 and
$4000 from the First National Bank there
last Monday. ' ' Â¦ -Â¦- . .
Ryan and ODea learned of the fact
that Collins had been In Seattle and had
returned to the city with $2000 or $3000 in
his pockets. They notified Chief Sullivan,
and the Chief gave them carte blanche Â«i
effecting his capture. They engaged a
room at Third and Howard streets Thurs
day afternoon and remained there till
yesterday afternoon, when Collins made
his appearance. Â¦ He fought desperately
with the two detectives, and as he is a
powerfully built young fellow , they had
all they could do to put the handcuffs on
him. When they reached the patrol box
at Third and Mission streets ODea, went
to the box to call the : patrol "Wujon
and Collins attacked Ryan viciously with
the handcuffs. Â» Ryan managed to throw
him down, and with O'Dea's assistance
held him pinned 'to the ground till I the
patrol wagon arrived/.
When searched at the. City Prison $340 85,
a diamond Â« ring, gold watch . and chain
and diamond locket, a ruby ring and wed
ding ring were found In nls pockets. - A
key was also found of a safe deposit box,
and an effort will be made to locate It, as
he â¢ is ; supposed to have left his money
there.* Collins was put In the "tanks" and
the police in : Seattle have been notified
of his arrest.
T<ast night Collins was positively identi-.
fled as tne man who some 'Â¦ time ago ' en
tered McCulllgan'B saloon at Tehama and
Third streets and stole $20 from the cash
drawer. â¢ Dan .Toland, Â¦: who : was present,
witnessed the; act, but did not Interfere,
as he was afraid that Collins would kill
him. Although Collins wore a mustache
at that time, Toland picked him out among
a dozen. other men at the Clty.Prlson last
evening.' -- ; "Â«KM^42gP^BÃ*3*flBfcrfeÂ«SEJÃBSsglses
- Collins Â¦ has also - been - identified as the
thief who stole a sack containing $400 from
Smith's j brokerage office at 321 Montgom
ery street several weeks ago. ,: : -, While leav
ing the j place with I the . sack of coin - Col
lins was seen by George Hodgklss, a Jani
tor in the Pacific' Stock. Exchange.' Hodg
kiss visited the City Prison Â¦-. last* evening
and readily recognized the thief. v
- " Detectives : Ryan ; and ODea have Â¦ gath
ered enough :. evidence against . Collins to
land '-him |in I the Â¦ penitentiary for the | rest
of his natural ; life. Â» Prior â¢to his escape
from the dock In the Police Court Collins
broke into a steamship office at the foot
of Jackson street and abstracted $40 from
the safe, which had been left open. A few
days later he entered the office of the Sau
salito ferry and sfole $170 and a bunch of
tickets. He Is also accused of breaking
into a cigar store at East and Market
streets and getting away with a small sum
of money from the till. , .
A short time afterward he entered the
office of the Stockton steamers in broad
daylight and going to the safe, proceeded
to get away with the cash drawer. One
of the clerka detected him in the. act and
grabbing the box, lustily shouted for the
police. Collins, after threatening to blow
his head off if he did not desist, coolly
helped himself to a ten-dollar bill and
left the place. Subsequently he robbed
the office of the.Tlburon ferry of $20 and
a number of postage stamps. Collins is
also accused of visiting the commission
house of J. Everdinsr & Co.. at 48 Clay
street, and stealing $38 from the safe dur
ing the temporary absence of the cashier.
On the same afternoon he went to a sa
loon.kept,by a man named Morsehead, at
22 Clay street. â¢ and robbed the â¢. safe â¢of
about $70 In gold. * The money was in a
secret Â¦ drawer, - but > Collins had no diffi
culty ;in finding ; it,', and forcing It r open
with a jimmy." â
Sergeant Ellis finally landed him and
charged him with burglary in connection
'with the raid on Morsehead's saloon. It
was while awaiting examination in ex-
Judge Low's court that he made the sen
sational escape from the prisoners' dock.
GATHERING OF RAILWAY
MEN AT KANSAS CITY
Secret Conference Bevives the Rumor
cf a Consolidation of West
ern Lines,
KANSAS CITT. March 23.â The recent
rumors of a big railroad consolidation in
volving the Union Pacific, the Chicago and
Alton, the Illinois Central and the Kan
sas City Southern, the latter road being
the reorganized Kansas City, Pittsburg
and Gulf, were revived here to-day, when
it became known that high officials of all
these lines were holding a secret confer
ence In Kansas City.
Among those participating In the con
ference were S. H. Felton, president of
the Chicag-o and Alton: Horace G. Burt.
president of the Union Pacific; E. H. Har
riman, president of the Oregon Short Line
and a director in the Union Pacific, the
Chicago and Alton and the Illinois Cen
tral and one of the controlling spirits in
the management of the Kansas City
Southern. ,

Robert Collins, a Clever Crook.
SANTA ROSA, March 23.-The start
ling allegations contained in the
petition of Robert D. Lodge, who
yesterday began contest proceedings
against the estate of the late John
D. Lodge, the well-known local capitalist,
who died here last October leaving prop
erty valued at a quarter of a million dol
lars. Is the talk of Sonoma County.
Everywhere people are discussing the
matter.
The parties principally affected are all
well known here. Mrs. Mathilda A.
Prince, the principal "heir according to the
provisions of the last will and testament
of the aged money-lender, is his daughter
and the wife of M. Prince, one of the
best-known merchants in Santa Rosa.
Berton Prince, another heir, is teller ,n
the savings bank of Santa Rosa, having
secured his position something over a
year ago through the influence of Mr.
Lodge, who held considerable stock in
that institution. David E. Lodge *is a
brother of Mrs. Prince and is also well
known here. , v' V ...
The most startling feature of the alle
gations made by the contestant is the
effect they will have on the heirs
named in the will, providing, of course,
that the charges are substantiated when
the matter comes to trial. In brief, the
situation is this: Sarah Jane Harris,
Mrs Prince and David E. Lodge are all
children of the dead capitalist and Mar
tha Lodge, the lady always recognized
here as his wife. The contestant claims
that J. D. Lodge and Martha Lodge were
never married, and that at the time they
claim to have been united in wedlock
Mary Ann Redman Lodge, the rightful
and "lawfully wedded wife Lodge married
in England in 1546. and afterward desert
ed to come to America, was still living,
and though she was never divorced lived
in Wakefleld until her death, on Septem
ber 7. 1892.
Documentary Evidence.
It was learned to-day that R. W. &>
J. K. Miller, the attorneys for the con
testant, claim to have some very strong
documentary evidence as to the correct
ness of their position. They have, or
claim to have, the original marriage cer
tificate issued to John D. Lodge and Mary
Ann Redman by the vicar of the parish
church in Wakefield. county of York,
England. This is dated February 23,
1546. They also have a's exhibit No. 2 a
certificate of birth and also one of bap
tism of Robert D. Lodge, the contestant,
the certificate of baptism bearing date of
January 20, 1550. They also hold a docu
ment purporting to be the deposition of
Jane Blades, a sister of the deceased cap
italist, who still lives in Wakefield, and
who, it is understood, alleges that she
was present at the wedding of her broth
er and Mary Ann Redman on February
23 1546, that she was present at the chris
tening on January 20. ISSO, that she has
known Robert D. Lodge, the contestant,
all his life and that she knows him to be
the sole heir and rightful legatee of her
deceased brother.
Petition in Court. |
In the Superior Court here this morning
the petition filed yesterday came up for
hearing and an order was issued directing
John P. Overton, president of the savings
bank of this city and the present adminis
trator of the Lodge estate, to appear on
April 9 and show cause why his letters
testamentary should not. in conformity
with the prayer of the petitioner, be re
voked, and Edwin Reynolds, the adminis
trator asked for by the contestant, be sub
stituted in his place. '
It is admitted that one of the biggest
legal battles in the history . of Sonoma
County is soon to begin in connection with
the matter. All the parties concerned are
prominent, socially, financially and other
wise; there Is a big fortune at stake and
what Is of still more Importance, it will
be a battle for a name and the rlg-bt to
use it .
The story of the Lodge estate as so far
told presents a striking: illustration of
the old adage concerning the frequency
with which the best laid plans miscarry.
During his lifetime Mr. Lodge always said
that none of his fortune would ever be
dissipated in the courts. With that idea
in view, being then in feeble health and
bowed down by the weight of advancing
years." he deeded something like $90,000
worth of hlÂ»- property to his wife in a
lump. Although in good health at the
time, a few weeks later she suddenly took
sick and died, and the old man was forced
to Invoke the assistance of the. law and
the courts to get this portion of his prop
erty back again.
Estate in. a Tangle.
While these proceedings were still pend
ing Lodge himself died and several other
attorneys were called in to help straighten
out the tangle in which this left matters.
A few weeks ago David E. Lodge accept
ed $20,000 in cash from the other heirs as
his share of the estate and entered Into
an agreement to waive all future claim
upon the estate In. consideration thereof.
Less than a week afterward Mrs. David
Lodge, his wife, who resides in Montana,
broupht suit against her husband for
maintenance and demanded that the
agreement referred to be set aside by
the courts. That was less than a month
ago. and now the present suit has been
commenced as a climax to the whole
series of contests.
The big estate over which so much liti
gation has resulted was accumulated prin
cipally in this county. In the pioneer days
old man Lodsre was engaged in the junk
business, and also In merchandising: in
Petaluma. For several years he was a
peddler. He was also a sewing-machine
a^ent and brought the first sewing ma
chinesâthe old "Florence"â into Sonoma
County, disposing of them In all sorts of
Â£ laces at prices ranging from $200 to $275.
>urinp his latter years he confined his
attention to loaning money, collecting
rents, clipping: coupons and receiving divi
dends from different institutions in which
he was interested.
Partnership With Reynolds.
In his business of lending money he was
during the last few years of his life in
timately associated with Edwin Reynolds,
the local capitalist, whom the contestant
now- asks to have appointed in * place of
John P. Overton as administrator of the
Lodge estate. Lodge and Reynolds han
dled most of/ their transactions together
and were very intimate. The fact that
Mr. Reynolds should have . allowed his
name to be used in -the case is regarded
by many, in view of the close relations
which for so long existed between the two
men, as very significant. It . Is argued
that unless Mr. Reynolds knew what he
was doing he would never have allowed
himself to become a party to the action,
and the point Is made that during the
years of his intimate acquaintance with
his now deceased friend he had every op
portunity to learn, if anybody ever did.

SAN BERNARDINO. March 23.â The In
terstate Commerce Commission com
menced its session this morning to hear
the case of A. W. Holdzkom on arbitrary
rates discriminating against local mer
chants in favor of Los Ansreles jobbers.
In this San Bernardino i 3 assisted by St.
Louis jobbers to secure a share of the
trade from this section. The members
comprising the court were J. C. Clements.
J. D. Yeomans and J. W. FUer. who
opened court in Department 2 of the Su
perior Court. Attorney E. E. Katz ap
peared for the plaintiff. W. A. Harris of
Los Angeles appeared for Santa Ana to
assist, and C. N. Sterry appeared for the
Santa Fe road, the Southern Pacific being
a silent witness of the proceedings.
Sterry objected to the taking of testi
mony because the same question had been
decided in . ISS9, when the commission in
session at Washington heard the case
from San Bernardino and gave a decision
in favor of the plaintiff, but was over
ruled by Judge Ross of the Los Aneelea
branch of the United States Circuit Court.
Sterry claimed tins was a similar case
and it had been decided. Katz pointed
out that rates were different and condi
tions different than when the first com
plaint was brought. The rates are on a
different basis and the town now la more
entitled to be called a competitive point
than at that time. I He denied the state
ment of Sterry that water carriers only
are competitive, claiming that two roads
are competitive. The commission took the
same view of the matter and ordered the
taking of testimony.
The point claimed by San Bernardino
merchants that through rates from the
East are charged to Los Angeles and then
arbitrary back again was proved by wit
nesses, even when carload lots were sent
through and back, of wagons, hardware
and other goods. But for this San Bernar
dino would become a jobbing point for a
large circle of territory. Ontario was In
stanced. It is miles from here but forty
from Los Angeles, but the rate from the
latter place Is much. less than from here.
In this manner San Bernardino Jobbers
are discriminated against, although bet
ter located than Los Angeles for a distrib
uting point, being also on two comoetinx
roads. A strong point was made for the
shippers from here when Los Angeles
claimed to have sea competition, making
a lower rate necessary. It was proven
that goods shipped by water to Los Ange
les were landed twenty to thirty miles
away at San Pedro or other points and
reshlpped by rail to Los Angeles, making
these points the real terminal and not Los
Angeles, yet these points . paid arbitrary
rates to Los Angeles the same as San
Bernardino. . . , . ,
General Freight Agent Chambers was
placed on the stand to explain why the
same rates prevailed on both. the South
ern Pacific and the Santa Fe roads. He
stood off the counsel and failed to ex
plain. W. A. Bissell, traffic manager of
the lines west of Albuquerque, was pres
ent to help out. The hearing occupied the
entire day and closed to be taken up again
at Los ' Angeles Monday next.
The Commissioners have their families
with them in special cars, accompanied
by M. S. Decker, assistant secretary, and
Â¦two stenographers and families, making
quite a Junketing party. They will be
taken around .the valley to-morrow and
leave this afternoon for Los Angeles. The
Commissioners say they have no power to
enforce a decision, even if in favor of San
Bernardino, until Congress acts and gives
them power. While the testimony was
taken by three Commissioners the whole
board of five will act upon it. It may
take months to reach a decision, as the
testimony must be transcribed and the at
torneys 'will file arguments in the case.

Special Dispatch to The Call
VANCOUVER, B. C. March 23.-The
steamer Warrimoo. which arrived this
afternoon from Australian ports, brought
news of a horrible tragedy which took
place among the cannibal natives %of
Lmtch New Guinea. .
Three ofiicers of the thousand-ton Brit
ish trading steamer General Pel were
captured by the natives, submitted to
frightful tortures and finally eaten. The
chief officer. Ernest Wiegand, was the
fourth in the party, who landed from the
steamer to take photographic views. He
managed to get away, although he was
cut and wounded by a flight of arrows
that were tent after him as he made his
escape.
Wlegand's story was that they had
taken several photographs and bad pro
ceeded half a mile inland to get a picture
ul the steamer lying in the harbor. There
they were suddenly surrounded by na
tives from a village several miles in the
interior. They were hustled away by a
large party of natives armed with spears
ana in an hour arrived at the outskirts of
the village. There they were undressed
and tied to a stake one at a time, while
the natives danced around and pricked
them with spears.
Two of the officers had been submitted
to this ordeal, and Wiegand supposes his
turn and that of the remaining junior offi
cer would have come next day. He heard
two men being taken away, and in the
evening the bones of their hands, which
had been cut off, were thrown down in
front of him. He -declares the men were
cooked and eaten. He was separated
from his companion during the night and
thinks he shared the same fate. In the
morning Wiegand made his escape, and,
though wounded by arrows, was able to
come up with the relief party sent out
from the ship. The Dutch warship Â¦ Su

tives. â¢ - . i

NEW YORK, March 23.â Frank Erne of
Buffalo successfully defended his title of
lightweight champion of the world
against Joe Gans (colored) of Baltimore
before the Broadway Athletic Club to
night. Erne did moet of the heavy fight-
Ing, displaying greater judgment and
more skill than his opponent. Gans re
ceived his punishment gamely until the
twelfth round., when his left eye was
started from Its socket by a terrific right
hand swing from the Buffalo boy. Gans
was helpless and there was no alternative
for the referee but to award the decision
to Erne." . :.:V -."
The contest drew" an Â¦ enormous crowd
to the Broadway Athletic Club. There
were many Â«bo wagered large sums- of
money that Gans would carry away the
championship. . There was bo much Balti
more money in . sight that Gans was
made a favorite at 100 to 90 a week ago,
and to-night the confidence of the.Mary
land people was so well established that
they Det on their man at odds of 100 to
70. There was a strong money-laden
contingent from Buffalo at the ringside,
and every man of the party bet heavily
on the little lad from their city, taking
every bet offered by the Marylanders. One
hunaerd to seventy on Gans was the
price offered, and the Buffalo people
snapped this up so quickly that the price
rose to 100 to feO. . -â¢ '
Erne's seconds were Frank Zimpfer,
Joe Fitzpatrick and George Salter. Gans
was accompanied by Al rterford. Harry
Lyons and Caleb Bond. Before the men
were introduced it was announced that
George McFadden of this city would
challenge the winner. The men agreed
to have a return match, no matter which
won. Straight Queensberry rules gov
erned. Â¦ ' ' ...... â¢
Erne Forces the Fighting.
Erne began rushing in the- opening
round, forcing Oans into his corner, but
was unable to land a telling blow. In the
second, third and fourth rounds Erne con
tinued to force the fighting, repeatedly
driving the negro to his corner; but Gans
blocked cleveny and avoided heavy pun
ishment. - .
The tirst hard blow was landed In the
fifth round, when Gans put a light left to
the face and Erne returned a jolting left
straight on the face.
In the sixth round, after Gans had been
forced to break ground, he stopped sud
denly and swung his left to Erne's right
eye. cutting It. Gans then went in, send
ing right and left swings to the head, and
Erne surprised everybody by replying
with similar blows. Erne continued to
slam both hands on the negro, reaching
tht latter's head half a dozen times,
stopping Gans' rushing and forcing the
negro to back away. Erne was bleeding
from the mouth and no#e at the bell.
At the beginning of the seventh round
Erne rushea and staggered Gans with a
right swing on the head and then stepped
in and shot his right up to Gans' chin.
Erne sent a hard left to the body, and
Gans planted a good right on the head.
Gans swung his left to the jaw and Erne
staggered but quickly recovered and
rushed back with left and right to the
body. The bell found them sparring, with
Gans on the defensive.
Erne jumped right to his man In the
eighth. He put a straight left to the face
and hooked It again to the ear. Gans
failed to counter, and Erne reached the
body and head with a left, forcing Gans to
break ground. Gans stepped In after fall
ing short with the left and uppercut Erne
on the face with his right.
Erne rushed again in the ninth, sending
his right over to the head. Gans landed
right and left on the head. This started
Erne, and both men let their arms go like
windmills. Erne having decidedly the bet
ter, of the mlxup. Erne hooked three lefts
to the ear, and Gans reached the body
with the left lightly. Erne had all the
better of this round.
Gans Loses His Speed.
Erne tried for the head in the tenth
and Gans slipped and almost went through
the ropes. Erne stepped in. sending a hard
left to the stomach, and Gans failed to re
ply. Gans then swung a left to the head
and Erne countered. Erne rushed his
man across the ring and planted a heavy
left to the wind. Then he sent a straight
left to the face and swung his right to the
face, but too high for a knockout at close

the defense : of- his old opponent. \ The
press : dispatches . tell of Â¦ the ; disagreement
of * the : burly sailor and - his , manager, in*'
which' there are charges ,and counter
charges.' "Jeffries refused to go further
into the matter, except to say, that when
boxers and their ; managers part company
hard things are often said on each side.'
The. champion 1 arrived here from" Los
Angeles yesterday, looking the picture of
a rugged, healthy athlete. : His appear
ance pets at rest all talk about his decline
in physical: condition. In explanation of
how. the reports of his 111 health started
he told of suffering from ringworm on his
face and chest- before the Sharkey fight.
Acting upon .-the advice of. an â¢acquaint
ance, he applied copper cents -soaked in
vinegar â¢ to- the; affected places. <A mild
attack of blood-poisoning Â¦ resulted, which '
gave rise to the stories of his having seen
his best days In the ring. y â¢ a " '
"I am In. better condition now. than at

questions. * "I have .been enjoying myself

condition.. I .weigh * about â¢ two' hundred
and ;.twenty-flve pounds. I have reduced
the size of my. legs by exercise and have
Increased the muscles from' my waist up."
-It is evident Jeffries shares the general
distrust as to the good faith of his pros
pective match with .Corbett. He volun
teered the statement that he would rather
meet Sharkey again,' as It would be more
Erofitable. 'Hesald he would rather meet
harkey than any other heavyweight, as
he knew Sharkey could not whip him and
some of the ;â¢ other heavyweights might
"'cop' him off," as- ha expressed it. : He
explained that Sharkey is not as strong
on his feefas-'Fltzslmmons, or-at least
could not .use his strength to such good
advantage as the Cornlshman. Regard-
Ing his. fight with 'the sailor he said his
poor showing was caused by a 1a 1 dislocation

shortly before the â¢ bout. : He thought It
had healed fairly well, but the first time
he let it go at Sharkey It went wrong

"He told my brother Jack I was too big
for him. I will' fight Fltzsimmons again,
but as champion I must -receive 60 per
cent of the prize money, win or lose.
These were the terms he dlctatedto me."
Of â¢ the possibility of â¢'â¢Â¦ another, trip to
Paris he Is not so- sure. â¢â¢"This country

bouts hardly ever lasted ar ound. I would
feint with my left for, the head and then
land heavily with my. right on the stom

some one else. I would, take: a chance."
Jeffries and his party 'will occupy a box
at the Alhambra to-night and will leave]
for the East to-morrow- night. They go ;
first to Kansas. City, where Jeffries has
an engagement. From there they go to
Chicago, where the big fellow | Is to meet
three men in one night. Two of ' these
are Jack McCormack and Ed Dunkorst
and Jeffries Intimated that they were a
sufficiently strong team to keep anybody
busy without the addition of a third un
known. After meeting aya v boxer named
Finnigan.for six -rounds at Detroit Jef- \
fries will settle down to. regular training
for Corbett. . ..
Tommy Ryan will continue to spar with
him in his training, but Billy L>elaney
will not; be among his handlers.
"Delaney. had a life position with me,"
said Jeffries, "but he acted badly and

The Old Methods of Treating Piles
and Rectal Diseases Supplanted
by the Pyramid Pile Cure. fifK
The old methods of treating; piles by
ligature, by the knife or by the cruel
methods of dilatation, besides causing: In-
tense pain and frequently collapse and
death, are now known to be but mere
makeshifts as far as a cure is concerned.
The liver is responsible for nearly every
case of piles and the mistake has been
made of treating piles as a purely local
disease. Such is not the case, however,
and the success of the new treatment
known as the Pyramid Pile. Cure has
demonstrated It.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is not a calve or
ointment, but a suppository which Is ap-
plied at night and absorbed into the Â»en-
FltU'e rectal membrane and acts both as
a local and a constitutional treatment,
and in cases of many years' standing this
treatment has been effectual.
Thousands of pile sufferers bear wit-
ness to the inestimable value of .the Py-
ramid, and even those who have under-
gone surgical operations without a- cure
hayÂ« been happily surprised by results
from a few weeks* treatment with the
Pyramid.
The relief from pain is so immediate
that patients sometimes lmajrine that thÂ©
Pyramid contains opiates or cocaine, be-
cause the relief is po Instantaneous, but
the Pyramid Pile Cure is guaranteed ab-
solutely free from any opiate or mineral
poison whatever.
The relief Js the result of the astrin-
gent propertle* of the remedy, which
causes the little tumors and congested
blood vessels to contract and a normal cir-
culation is established.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is strictly scien-
tific, both In Its composition and In Its
therapeutic acUon. and the best feature
of It Js that It Is perfectly safe and harm-
less. No ill. effects ever result from Its
u?e. but only positive benefit.
A Fin^ular fact. In view of the lanre
number of patent medicines before the
public, is that the Pyramid Is the only
pile cure of national reputation. It Is the
only pile cure popular, enough- and meri-
torious enough to be found In every druir
store in the United States. It Â«ells at SO
cents a package.

JOE PIGGOTT
PILOTS THREE
WINNING HORSES
Â»
First on Carlonian, Lodestar
and Hard Knot at
Tanforan.
Another Good Day for the Books, as
Pour Favorites Were Slaugh
tered â The Lady Met
With Success.
?
It was Joe Piggotfs day to shine in the
saddle at Tanforan yesterday. The young
man landed first at the wire with Car
lonian, an outsider. Lodestar, a lukewarm
choice, and Hard Knot, while incidental
ly dropping in second astride Florabird.
Owing to a slight accident on Thursday
Henry was not seen in the saddle.
The talent again suffered severely, all
but two choices finishing back in the
i^ir.ch, with hard luck tales as the only
excuse for their showing.
The Baldwin pair of youngsters, Mal
donado and Oscar Tolle, . coupled, closed
favorite for the two-year-old scramble.
Most faith was reposed In the former, but
he again ran disappointingly. Piggott
rushed the 10 to 1 shot Carlonian away
in the lead, and the big fellow lasted long
enough to beat Oscar Tolle a length.
After a somewhat lengthened vacation
Ab Stemler started Lodestar in the slx
furlong run following, and got the money.
Backed from 6 to 4. the chestnut horse
caught True Blue at the paddock, win
ning out by less than a length.
Florablrd. ridden by Piggrott, gave The
Lady, a 7 to 10 chance, quite an argument
in the mile and a sixteenth run. Marty
Bergen piloted the favorite and was com
pelled to ride out to down the Shulte en
try. Prettorne took third place from Red
Cherry, the only other starter.
Why Arbaces on the strength of his re
cent showing was made favorite for the
mile was a mysury, still Stcmler's horse
closed an even money choice. Hard Knot,
with Piggott In the saddle. In front from
the jump, won ridden cut from Scotch
Plaid. The favorite finished a poor third.
A poor start beat Silver Tone, favorite
for the seven furlong Jaunt. Gauntlet, at
5 to 1, moved up from third position, get
ting the decision by half a length at the
stand from Monda. Silver Tone was
fourth, behind Momentum.
Red Pirate, at 5 to 1. captured the clos
ing mile run in a gallop. Perseus took
the place from Espionage.

"PREP." SCHOOL
ATHLETES IN
COMPETITION
Sensational Performances Ex
pected To-Day at Academic
League Games.
rr T A HE spring championship meet-,
J~ mg of the Academic Athletic
league, to be Jield this afternoon on
Berkeley Oval, is an indication of
the marked revival of interest on
this Coast in amateur athletics and
all manly sports and pastimes. The
entry list for this, the twelfth semi
annual renewal of lh* High School
boys' games, greatly exceeds any
prcz-ious list. The performances
ere expected to be almost up to the
sta::dard of those shozen at inter
collegiate games. Ukiah High
School sends an exceptionally
strong team and is expected to win
the championship banner. Its
hurdlers and jumpers are the clcz'
crcst in the league. Stephen A'sbill
of the Lozvcll High School is pro
nounced tl'.c fleetest of the sprinting
brigade. So many new names ap
pear in the list of competitors that
some nczi' star may Hash suddenly
across the horizon and surprise the
spectators. The pupils of the vari
ous schools rri// be present with
their colors and their cheers to urge
on the youths who represent them
in the stirring competition.
BERKELEY ATHLETES
ON THE CINDER PATH
PErKKUT. March 3.â The past week
has been an exciting one in track atti-
Iptir-s: at tho University cf California. The
time is rapidly approaching when the
"lucky ten" who will carry the Blue and
Gold to Eastern fields will be chosen.
Starch SI has beÂ«i set as the U. C. meet,
or better the try-out for the Eastern
fam. Then raen whose records balance
evenly but who have never come together
in a race will meet. When men with rec
ords acd possibilities like Drum and Ca
dogan meet there will be a race worth
going miles to see.
The freshman-sophomore field day last
Saturday did not bring out any new men.
The best performance was that of Powell
in the hurdles and mile run. Cadogan did
not run because of illness and there were
no others who could do notable work with
the exception of Plaw, who threw the
hammer 147 feet, showing that great
things may be expected of him later on.
Sc-ldcm has the cinder path seen such an
Cfrgrefration of athletes as has been out
this week. Bakewell. in the hurdles;
Drum. Cadogan. Symmonds and Lawson
in the sprints; Squires, in the distances;
Hoffman, pole vaulting and high jump
ir.jr; Walsh in the walk and Broughton
in the broad jump. Woolsey. the best.all
around man on the team, who can do the
hurdles, the sprints, the high jump and
shct put. has not been out regularly for
tTvo weÂ«-ki=. Early in the season he began
training with cross-country runs. The
thin tennis shoes he wore made a small
blister on his left foot and a plight touch
of b'.ood-pMsonlng followed. He has not
been out since, but has assiduously doc
tored his wound. This accident was un
fortunate, as Wool s=ey has given up the
eprlnta an<l will po into some other event,
lie will run the 22f>-yard hurdles and put
the fhot. Bakewell will take care of the
1^ and 220 hurdle races. Plaw. the prom
ising hammer-thrower. Is doing his train
ing In East Oakland, as the field Is not
large enough for his throws. There Is
danger of injuring some one.
Track Captain Drum has had the watch
in his hand most of the week, timing the
nip-n and coaching. Some splendid time
has br-en made, considering the time of
The season, the weather and the condition
of the track. None of the men seem to
have any trouble in equaling their records
cf last year. This promises much for the
* season's records. Hoffman received a
n*>w pole from the East yesterday and
tried it for the first time. It is about the
same weight as is used here, but is
toupher, and Hoffman says he has more
confidence in It. He is endeavoring to
imitate the Eastern style of vaulting. As
he has done heretofore his hands have
been a couple of feet apart as he vaulted
the stick. Now. however, in imitation of
the Eastern style, he runs both hands
together as he attains the proper height
in the air. That gives the body better
leverage and more swing.
While the baseball team Is out each
evening, there ha.s not been a line-up of
the entire team this week. The last week
of rain and the loss of two practice games
has *et things backward a little. The
infield remains intact, but the outfield is
very unsatisfactory. Wolf, last year's left
field, may not play again this season, a.*
he has been 111 for two weeks. 'Nothing
definite Is known of the present condition
of the team, and will not be known until
the next match game.

CARDINAL TEAM IS
ROUNDING INTO FORM
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 23.â
The rapid approach of Intercollegiate
contents is spurring the cardinal's ath
letes to renewed efforts. Each day shows
improvement on the part of both base
ball and track men. Nearly a hundred
men are training for some one of the va
rious teams under the guidance of Dr.
Murphy, and in nearly every case satis
factory condition Is belnsr approached.
Stanford's most hopeful outlook this
. f .;non is on the diamond, and this Is
artera Interest naturally centers. The
team work and batting of the men has
shown marked Improvement. More spirit
is being put Into the game, and the men
are finally at a point on the upper grade
for which Coach Murphy has so long
waited The personnel of the team re
mains practically unchanged. Hampson
relieves Lanagan In the minor games and
has done creditable work for a new roan.
Edwards has been put at shortstop. Cap
tain Strohn taking his place at third. Ha
vf-ns continues to hold down the initial
bag in a satlsfactorw manner and seems
a fixture in th<Â» place. Symonds' work
In th^ fipld Ib commanding attention from
the experts. He is sure and is in every
play. His batting is also strong. The final
gam<> with the Fireman's Fund will be
played to-morrow In San Francisco on
the Folsom-street grounds. The last game
of the series w-ent to the cardinal and a
close contest is expected between the
teams, as they are old rivals and well
matched.
The claps contests have done much to
strengthen Interest in track matters. The
victory of the freshman team over the
Oakland High School last Saturday has
given the baby team much encourage
ment. Manager Cantwell is arranging a
meet for them with the University of
Nevada team at Reno. Next Friday will
be celebrated as junior day, when ' the
teams from the four classes will contest
for the college championship.

to the county road, the Sharon estate and
the Burlingame field, the second check
being near the house, of R. T. Coleman.
Resuming the hounds ran through the
Easton and Millbrae properties, finishing
at Millbrae dairy. The chase was for the
most part over level country, and a fast
pace was set. Several or the riders
cleared the fences in their normal condi
tion without taking advantage of the
places where the- top- rail had been : re
moved. The following riders were out:
Mrs. H. T. Scott, Miss Whitney, Miss

MISS HOFFMAN
WINS WOMEN'S
COUNCIL CUP
Tie in a Championship Golf
Tournament to Be Played
Off To- Morrow.
This morning a caddies' golf tournament
will be held on the Presidio links over
eighteen holes, medal play, for sets of
clubs as prizes. In order to restrain the
ambition of the caddlts to hand In won
derful 6cores ladles? will accompany them
as scorers. Eight caddies qualified last
week, of whom Jack Kelly made the ex
cellent score of 49 for nine -holes, not
withstanding the fact that the grass
through the fair green is quite long. The
prizes are presented by C R. Winslow of
the San Francisco Golf Club.
The second competition for the Council's
cup for women oi the San Francisco .Golf
Club 'ended yesterday. The opening round
was played on Monday, ; tiie semi-tinal
round on Wednesday and the final round
yesterday. The eight who qualified were
Miss Alice Colden. Hoffman, whose score
over the eighteen holes, medal play, in
the qualifying round was 53, 63â116; Miss
Mary Scott, Miss Maud O'Connor, Miss
Caro Crockett, Mrs. Ft. G. Brown, Miss
Maud Mullms, Miss Ella W. Morgan and
Miss Edith Cneseorough. The four win
ners in the first round were Miss Alice
Hoffman. Miss Caro Crockett, Miss Maud
Muilins and Miss Ella W. Morgan, the
opponents of the last two defaulting. The
winners in the semi-final round were Miss
Alice Hoffman and Miss Caro Crockett.
By defeating Miss Caro Crockett 3 up, 2 to
play. In the final round Miss Alice Hoff
man becomes the winner of the Council's
cup for the second time. If she wins a
third competition the trophy will become
hers.
E. R. Folger and C. P. Hubbard, hav
ing tied in the final round over thirty-six
holes for the championship of the Oak
land and San Francisco Golf clubs, the
tie will be played off to-morrow over eight
een holes on the Oakland links.
Willie Anderson, who, with Horace
Rawllns, has been Instructor at the Oak
land links since October of last year, and
who has won three out of the four pro
fessional golf tournaments held at Oak
land, Burllngmae and Coronado, will re
turn shortly to the Eastern States. T.
W. Tetley. until recently Instructor at the
San Rafael links, has gone to the southern
part of the State, in company with Mrs.
Tetley, but will return to San Francisco.
David Stephenson, to the regret of the
members of the San Francisco Golf Club,
will leave the Presidio links at the end
of April. No arrangements have yet been
made for his successor. During nis stay
at the Presidio Stephenson has given
great satisfaction, being a fine player, a
good instructor and club maker, and one
of the longest drl% - ers that ever teed a
ball. The San Rafael Golf Club Is at pres
ent without an instructor, but .the direct
ors are in correspondence with some pro
fessionals and expect shortly to conclude
their arrangements. No tournaments will
be played until next month, though sev
eral enthusiasts are regular In their prac
tice on the links. Stephenson has sev
eral times visited the San Rafael course
and It Is hoped that Willie Anderson and
Horace Rawlins will play over it before
they leave California In April. â¢
The Redlands Golf Club has instituted
challenge playing, the ten best players
being ranked from 1 to 10, and any mem
ber with a lower number being permitted
to challenge the player next above him.
If the challenged player is defeated the
two change places, the winner being en
titled to challenge the one above his new
number and the loser being liable to chal
lenge from the one below him. Number
10 may be challenged by any member of

One week from to-morrow the baseball
season will begin. At Eighth and Harri
son streets San Francisco .will line up
against Oakland and In Sacramento that
team will meet the Stocktons.
All members of the clubs were ordered
to report on Tuesday for active practice.
This was done,', and' since that day the
ball has been tailing through the air and
the tats whizzing about the heads of the
fans in their preparation for the season.
The teams are formed and will be In fair
shape even at the Inaugural games.
The way the teams will line up on Sun
day, April 1, is as. follows:

Rube Levy is at it again. If his prac

old-timer will show up in his best form.
The Dudes are taking several doses of
flattery to themselves. They think they
are the team par excellence on account of
the fine array of field talent. :

.with the diagonal . of the square plate
placed to the pitcher's advantage the
rubber will be fixed In the ground on the
square, allowing the pitcher a much
smaller space for strikes. This change
will quicken the game, giving the batter
the advantage.

Considerations of this nature forbid a
demand by us to fortify the canal, ana
It Is safe to say that Secretary Hay. dur
ing the negotiations, never made such a
proposition; to do so would at once sug
gest the Inquiry of old Dr.- Catus, TÂ«rhen
assured by Dame Quickly of the Integ
rity of the young man found lurking in
his closet: "Yes, but vat shall de honest
man do In my closet?" If this work is
neutralized, what do you want of forti
fications? Against whom are they to be
erected? Are not your navy and ours to
gether able to protect It against any other
maritime state that would menace Its
neutrality? Yes. against all the others
put together! Then why fortify? You do
not contemplate breaking the neutrality
yourselves. I would not insult you by
such a suggestion. Do you suspect us of
such a design? You surely would not so
insult us. Then why fortify? I know
no answer to this query, and I think there
Is none.
As to the choice then between neutraliz
ing and fortifying the canal it appears
to me that the guaranty of* the United
States and Great Britain, even if they
stood alone, would afford a better protec
tion to it than any possible- fortifications.
But they will not stand alone for the In
tention evidently Is to establish its neu
trality by the concurrence of all maritime
nations. And to make this Intent plain
and easy of accomplishment the terms
adopted for the purpose, by consent of all
the powers, as applied to the Suez canal,
are Incorporated in the text of the pres
ent document. No nation that agreed to
apply those rules to the. one canal could
refuse them to the other. Thus sanc
tioned the neutrality of both works will
become a part of the law of nations and
the power that would violate It would by
the act proclaim Itself a common enemy
and Invite the hostility of all. It wili
never be done.
I am tempted to press the argument
further and ask what possible good forti
fications can do? Protect the work
against attack? But this assumes it in be
come the theater of hostilities, and th<*
moment it becomes such it will be aban
doned by commerce and given up to the
uses of the hostile fleets which make It
their battle ground. For does any one
imagine that the approaches to the canal
will in such case be neutralized, while the
waterway Itself Is otherwise? Some
writers appear to suppose that we can
keep It neutral In all wars, except aueh
as the United States are parties to. and
an Instrument of war In them. This Is as
absurd as the other suggestion, for while
we might enforce neutrality In the ranal
Itself and its terminal ports, what about
the approaches to those ports? There you
are dealing with the high seas, the high
way of nations, on which we havr. no
right to constitute ourselves peace offlcerj
and where we would be unable to enferca
our mandate if we attempted It. Fancy
a maritime war and United States cruiser*
endeavoring to keep the canal open t;>
commerce by escorting Into and out of It
ships of either cf the belligerent powers.
How long wouta it take us to become In
volved In the war as principals? I repeat,
we have to choose between neutralization
and fortification, and neutralization is on
every ground preferable.

THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
WHEN the operation of the McKinley tariff and
other notable acts of Republican legislation
during the Presidency of Benjamin Harrison
had brought about a high degree of prosperity
throughout the country, many Republicans became
so sanguine that the people would support the ad
ministration" in the succeeding Presidential election
that they neglected their political duties, took no ac
tive part in the campaign, and; trusted to the com
mon sense of the voters to re-elect President \ Harri
son. The result was a sweeping Democratic victory,
the enactment of the Wilson tariff and a period of
industrial depression and financial disaster, from the
effects of which we have not yet fully recovered.
The warning of that "experience should be enough
to rouse Republicans to action at this juncture.
Once more we have had an administration of pro
tection and sound money. Once more the factories
have been busy, work and wages have been abundant,
and a general prosperity pervades all classes of the
population. Once more every prospect of the time
promises a sure Republican victory .at the elections.
Once more there is every temptation to Republicans
to look upon the contest as a foregone conclusion not
worth while for a busy man to trouble himself about.
Are the similarities between this -year and 1892 to be
carried further still? Are we to have another year of
Republican over-confidence, resulting in' a Demo
cratic victory?
At this time it is the duty of every Republican who
has sufficient vigor to take an active part in the cam
paign to unite himself with a Republican club and as
sist in organizing it for effective work; These club
organizations ought to be effected in 'every county,
city, ward and precinct in the State. They should,
moreover, be formed in time to elect strong delega
tions to the convention of Republican League Clubs,
which is to assemble at Los Angeles on April 27.
Before the convention meets there, is ample time for
the formation of clubs in all localities where none
exist, and the election of delegates to represent them
in the convention, but there is no time to spare. The
work of organization, therefore, should be begun at
once.
Since the results of the over-confidence in 1892,
there ought not to-be needed any 'great amount of
urging to rouse Republicans to the performance of
their duty this year. There can be no incentive to
action more eloquent or more impressive than the
warning remembrance of those years, of hard times
resulting from Republican carelessness. This year
there should be activity, organization and co-opera
tion from the start.
POOLROOM GAMBLING CHANCES.
1~) EFORE the New York Legislature there is
r^\ now pending a bill designed to prevent pool
~^ rooms from obtaining betting quotations from
racetracks, prize-rings or any other event on which
bets are made. The main purpose of the measure is
to put an end to betting on races, for that form of
gambling has now become one of the worst evils^ of
the country.
Commenting upon the measure the New York
Tribune says: "Experts say that the average player
at faro, roulette or keno has a better chance to win
now and then and is not in so deep and miry a pit
as the frequenter of the poolrooms. The plain truth
is that a great deal of so-called racing carried on in
Louisiana, in California, in Illinois, in other States
of the Union, and even in the Empire State itself,
is kept up chiefly for the poolrooms, and is dishonest
through and through."
\ The experience of San Francisco with the East
ern track gamblers who have been trying to obtain
a renewal of the' former gambling privileges at Ingle
side track amply confirms the statement of the New
York experts. 7 " The track 'events which are adver
tised as races are virtually put up jobs to defraud the
public, or at least that portion of it that is foolish
enough to bet on the results. It would be just as ex
pedient to license roulette or faro games as the kind
of racing that is now provided by the track gamblers.
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
THE people of this city practically voted for
public ownership of public utilities when 'they
ratified the charter.
Like many other matters, this policy is believed to
be beneficial and to be capable of doing away with
many old vexations without causing new ones in their
place. It has been tried elsewhere, and those who de
sire to try it here are not left without the guidance of
experience. We find one expectation abroad that
will be disappointed. This is the feeling that when
these public utilities are. run by the Government the
people will have their use free of cost. Â¦ Government
does nothing gratis. It protects life, liberty ; and
property, for a consideration, and is the sternest and
firmest of all protectors in exaction of its price.
When it runs the transportation, light and water
supply business of the city they will be run but little
differently from now. The Government way of ad
ministering public utilities may be judged by the way
in which it does those things intrusted to it now. It
has charge of the streets, sewers, Police, Fire and
School departments, of the courts and public charities.
If justice is promptly administered, the schools, police
and fire -service are above criticism, and the streets
and sewers always in fine order, we may anticipate
equal excellence in administering the public utilites
which the Government is expected to assume.
The city erects public buildings. If they are built
better and more .economically than private buildings,
and if their construction moves promptly, without
delay, we may expect the same economy and prompt
ness when the city owns all the public utilities.'. The
people have examples before them and can judge
for themselves. 'Let it be understod as a fundamental
principle that adding more duties to those already
ill discharged never yet produced reform. We are
satisfied that the people intend to adopt the policy
of public ownership. As it will cost a large primary
outlay, that will rest upon the credit of the city, there
should be ample assurance that it will produce effects
in our civic life that will more than offset the in
cubus of a large debt. Information on the subject
should be gathered from all available sources, for
when the step is once taken its recall will be diffi
cult, even if it prove unwise.
We believe Philadelphia is the only city that has
receded from this policy, when once adopted. She
owned her own gas works, and administered them
until the service became so bad and so costly that
it was found expedient to turn the plant over to pri
vate partiesr which was done, with immediate im
provement in the service and the cost.
But a backward step is always hard. The expe
rience of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washing
ton and Chicago, in the municipal ownership of
water supply, demonstrates that public ownership
does not automatically purify water, make it plentier
or cheaper. These things have to come just as they
do under private ownership, by expert management
and close application of business principles.
The president of Yale has pointed out that under
public ownership the administration of public utili
ties will be in as few hands as now, if it is to -be at all
tolerable. The same skill will have to be found and
paid for as is now required, and unless this is done,
regardless of politics and in spite of partisanship, the
system will break down. As far as it can aid, The
Call will assist the people to a right conclusion as to
this policy by giving them exact facts upon which to
base their action. Many proponents of public own
ership make the serious mistake of discussing it with
prejudice toward the present owners of the utilities
to be taken over. This is wrong. The policy should
be adopted not for the harm it will do a few of the
people, but for the good it will do all of the people.
Chancellor McCracken of New York University
nnnonnces that one of the provisions made by the
donor for the administration of the much discussed

from a tour through the South says: "Bryan is a

That may be taken as a striking illustration of the
truth that a man finds what he is looking for. When
Bryan made his recent trip to the Southern States
he was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere. It . is
going to take air the force of another defeat at the

CONGRESS AND THE POSTOFFICE.
Iâ|OR1 â |OR the third time the efforts of Congressman
I Loud to put an end to the abuse of the second
rate mail privilege have been defeated. The
country should now demand of the majority against
the Loud bill the enactment of some measure which
will serve the purpose of putting an erfd to- the de
ficit in the postal revenue. The responsibility is upon
them. The administration, the Postoffice Depart
ment and the House Committee on Postal Affairs
have been thwarted in their efforts to check the
abuses that cause the deficit, and h is clearly the
duty of the opposition to- bring forward a -measure
of their own.
- We hear much in these days of the advantage of
governmental control of the operation of public
utilities, and yet we have in the management of the
postoffice a yearly deficit due solely to the annual
refusal of Congress after Congress to remedy plain
evils. If the National Government, which draws to
itself the services of the ablest politicians of the na
tion, cannot run to advantage so simple a business
as that of shipping mailbags and fixing rates of post
age, what is to be expected if it should undertake to
operate railroads?
There have been two measures proposed for getting
rid of the deficit By the method supported by Con
gressman Loud the postoffice would be placed upon
a paying basis by limiting to genuine periodical pub
lications the privilege of second class mail rates, as
it is known that the yearly .shortage in the revenues
is due to the practice of carrying cheap novels, ad
vertising pamphlets, quack medicine circulars and
other stuff of the kind for less than cost. The sec
ond plan is that of reducing the rates now paid to
railroads for hauling mail.- Either of the plans woukd
be good, but Congress will enact neither. When the
first plan is before the House the majority declares
itself in favor of the second, but when the second is
brought forward there is always a majority against
that also.
The shilly-shally policy of Congress in dealing
with the subject is the more exasperating because
many important and much desired postal reforms and
extensions are dependent upon it. * So long as there
is an annual deficit, we can hardly expect any con
siderable extension of the postal service to the peo
ple, and so the desire for one cent letter postage, for
a cheap parcels post, for the circulation of books from
public libraries through the mails and the establish
ment of postal savings banks will have to wait. Ear
nest as are the promoters of these various plans for
utilizing the postoffice for the general good, they can
hardly hope to succeed until Congress has provided
an economical administration of such service as the
department now renders. ' .
Such being the situation of affairs,. the people will

YELLOW WAR.
I *OR some time the yellow twins of Mr. Hearst
have been trying to alarm the country and call
attention to themselves by sensational publica
tions regarding the assembling of an American fleet
in Chinese waters. These bawling babies of journal
is-m have seen an encounter in those waters between
England and Russia, with the United States helping
England. So the weary drivel has gone on, day
after day. The lack of facts has been no hindrance,
for to the Hearst twins the invention of facts is a
craft that does not require even the use of "the long
est leased wire in the world." So they have cried
"war looms." and have published the register of the
American fleet assembled in those distant and dis
ttrrbed waters. On the 20th inst. they had the
Oregon, New Orleans, Newark, Monadnock, Castine
and. Atlanta '"off China" and ready for a swoop, fell
or otherwise. The same date the Navy Department
was notified by Admiral Watson, at Manila, that the
gunboat Wheeling had steamed for Taku, where she
wonld be relieved May 10 by the Concord, that she
may proceed to her patrol duty in Bering Sea. The
Wheeling is the "big squadron," the "formidable
fleet," the "warships now on the Chinese coast," all
by herself, about which the Journal and Examiner
have been in hysterics for more than a week.
Perhaps it is found necessary to divert public at
tention from the serious consequences of the Ex
aminer's discover}' of bubonic plague in this city.
That combination of lying sensation and official stu
pidity is costing San Francisco dearly, and it need
never have been except for the morbid desire of that
psychopathic paper for new sensation.
This manufacture of news cannot be too strongly
rebuked. A newspaper is supposed to reflect its politics,
its prejudices if you please, in its editorial columns,
and these are read with that understanding. But a
newspaper that is guided by the least sense of duty
to its readers in its news columns gives the facts 'as
they are, without invention or sophistication. Peo
ple read the ne;vs in a paper with a feeling of faith
and belief, which is not present when they read edi
torial opinions. Against these the reader is on
guard, but he is not guarded when he reads the news.
Therefore a paper which digests, dilutes, rejects or
invents matter for its news columns is guilty of the
most serious imposition upon its readers. The only
rule in handling news is to publish all that is fit to
print, and leave to tlie good sense of the reader the
digestion of the mass.
It is therefore a grave violation of the proprieties
and decencies cf journalism and a serious offense
against its readers for a newspaper to tamper with its
news. It was an offense deserving punishment for
the Examiner to cut out of its Washington dispatches
ell reference to Congressman dc Vries ift connection
with the big trees, the vote on the Porto Rico
tariff and the wood pulp tariff. It was a still more se
rious offense in that paper to invent bubonic plague
Â¦when none existed, and to persist in publishing San
Francisco as an infected city, to the damage of our
commerce and business. These fakes are now fol
lowed by the invention of a war in Asia between
Enpiar.d and Russia, with the Unite<l States standing
in with a formidable fleet, when there is no war and
tliis country has ordered one small 'gunboat to steam
to the Chinese coast.
Such journalism is a danger always. Readers- make
tip. their opinions from the reports of events which
they read in the papers as news, and when these re
ports are false, or juggled, or invented, the opinions
formed on them are of course unreliable.

EDITOR of The Callâ There is much
misunderstanding in the public
mind as. to the merits of the Hay-
Pauncef oto treaty now before the
Senate.": lts opponents assume and
havb induced the belief that - the
Clayton-Bulwer convention, which' it
supplements, was Injurious to our Inter
ests and favorable to Great Britain. This
is Just the reverse of the fact, as recur
rence to its terms and the circumstances*
Tinder which.it was made will show. 1
was interested In and familiar with the
occurrences at the time; permit me to re
call them. â¢
The negotiations took place duftng the
winter of 1549-50. under President -Taylor.
Mr. Clayton was our Secretary of State
and Sir Henry Bulwer British Minister at
Washington. Great Britain was then the
most formidable power in Europe. She
possessed all the principal ocean transits
of -the old world, and her statesmen
seemed bent on acquiring those of the
new. Holding Gibraltar, Corfu and Malta,
she controlled the Mediterranean. By the
possession of Aden, at the mouth of the
Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, she commanded
the Red Sea and the overland route to
the East. She held the Cape of Good-
Hope, the half-way house, by the ocean
route, to the same region and with It isl
ands and colonies all over. Singapore was
hers, in front of which passes all the
commerce of the farther East, through
the Straits of Malacca, and those of Tor
res were commanded by Cape York, also
hers.
In the Western Hemisphere, Halifax,
Bermuda, Jamaica and a long string of
Islands between it and Trinidad formed a
chain of naval posts along our Atlantic
Coast, and that of Central America, com
manding all access to the Caribbean Sea,
and enabling her to control the eastern
approach to the isthmus, and the entrance
to any possible intercceanic canal, bhe haj
within a short time seized the island of
Kuatan, on the coast of Honduras, and
had set up a protectorate over the Mos
quito Indians, a tribe living within the
boundaries of Nicaragua. These savages
she treated as an inuependent nation and
recognized their chief as reigning at Blue
fields, just north of San Juan del Norte,
In his name she had seized and held pos
session of the town and harbor of San
Juan, and he exercised the functions of
government, under the guidance of a
British Consul, accredited to him, but re
siuing at that last-named place. This was
done expressly to affirm his possession or
the place, and it was further supported
by the constant presence of a British gun
boat in the harbor. San Juan, under
stand, lies at the mouth of. the river,
which discharges the waters of the lake
into the ocean, and is, for a hundred and
twenty-five miles, to form the bed of the
canal. The Mosquito King thus claimed
and exercised sovereignty over the ter
minal harbor of the proposed canal and
for an undefined distance up its unin
habited banks, and this, under, the. pro
tection and with the armed support of the
foremost power of all Europe! For Eng
land was then at the zenith of her power
and prestige. "Her morning drum-beat,"
said Mr. Webster, "following the sun and
keeping company with the hours, circles
earth with one continuous and unbroken
strain or the martial airs of England."
She was the dominant power of Europe.
, 'The United States, on the other hand,
had a population of less than twenty-four
millions and merely the nucleus of a navy
and army. AYe had ju3t acquired Califor
nia from Mexico, but our. only access to
It was by the ocean voyage round Cape
Horn or the weary six months' "trek"
across the plains. Of all things we need
ed a short route to the Pacific, and the
mind of the nation Instinctively turned to
an isthmian canal. Its power, however,
was more . than , half : paralyzed by our
eternal anti-slavery controversy, 1 ; which
then and through all. the summer of ISSO
raged with unprecedented - violence. â¢ â¢Â¦â¢ Con
gress eat until the middle of September,
and Its debates were as acrimonious and
violent as those which preceded the Civil
War; they threatened the dissolution of
the Union. California was kept out of it
from December, 1849, till September, 1850,
all because of the slavery question. What
might or might not result from a serious
difficulty with Great Britain over Central
American affairs no man could foresee.
At that time the construction of the
Panama Railroad had been commenced
by a New. York corporation under a con
cession from New Granada, and a com
pany called the Atlantic and Pacific Ship
Canal Company, at the head of which was
Commodore Vanderbllt, had secured a
grant from the State of Nicaragua of the
right to build a ship canal across that
country. These parties desired the for
mal protection of our Government, or if
Eossible the joint protection of the United
tates and Great Britain, for their enter
prise, and this led up to the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty. In substance It provides
that neither nation shall ever obtain or
maintain any exclusive control of the pro
posed canal or erect or maintain any for
tification commanding the same or its vi
cinity; that neither will colonize, occupy.
fortify or exercise dominion over Nicara
gua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito coast or any
part of Central America, nor make use of
any protection, alliance, influence or con
nection of either with any State or Gov
ernment - through whose territory the
canal may pass, to obtain for its citizens
or subjects any rights of commerce or
navigation not offered on equal terms to
tho citizens of the other.
In case of war between the contracting
parties, vessels of either nation, travers
ing the canal, shall be exempt from block
ade capture, or detention, and both par
ties agree to protect the canal, when con
structed, from interruption.' seizure or
unjust confiscation. The object of all
thesje provisions was declared to be not
the attainment of a particular end, but
the establishment of a general principle,
which would be extended to any other
practicable communication between the
two oceans. Provisions are added for
neutralizing the canal and its terminal
ports and fpr inviting other nations to
unite in these arrangements.
There Is the Clayton-Bulwer treaty! It
was regarded at the time as a ' signal
triumph of Amercan Â¦ diplomacy, and con
sidering the circumstances, justly so. Its
terms, far from being severe on us. were
ail in our favor, for It constituted Eng
land's final renunciation at all aggrandize
ment on this continent, south of the Can
ada line, and to emphasize this. ' the ex
cnange of Â¦ its ratifications was fixed for
July. 4, ISSO, thus made' doubly the anni
versary of our independence. In pursu
ance of It. atter decent brief delay, Eng
land withdrew her Consul from San Juan
and her gunboat from the harbor; Nicar
agua quietly entered and took possession
pi the place. The Mosquito 1 monarchy,
deprived of British support, relapsed Into
Its original insignificance, and Americans
were left free to build the canal under
the joint protection of the two powers,
which was also extended to the Panama
railroad. The ' canal company failed to
obtain the money to build the work, but
did establish a transit line across Nicar
agua, by which thousands were brougnt
to California, down to lSsti. when it was
broken up by the Walker invasion of that
State., wnlch ruined the company.
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty thus deliv
ered us from all difficulties and compli
cations arising from questions as to sov
ereignty on the isthmus and left our
countrymen free to build the canal, under
the protection of both governments,
neither of which was\ to seek to obtain
any exclusive ownership of or control
over it. It was to be neutral, unfortified
and open on equal terms to the com
merce of the world. Nothiug could be
fairer or more liberal. It has been in
force fifty years, fairly observed by both
parties. Neither has withdrawn from It
or claimed that it is not as binding to
day as the day after its execution. It is
the law of the land and cannot be re
pealed by valiant speeches or defiant edi
torialsâby nothing in short save the con
sent of both parties or an act of Con
gress. The progress 'of events since that
treaty was made has greatly modified the
conditions of this question. The com
merce of the world has vastly increased,
steamers have supplanted sailing vessels;
the size of ocean craft has been quad
rupled; Germany and Japan have been
added, to the maritime powers of the
world, and Great Britain, the greatest of
them, has got a ship canal of her own at
Sues, giving her easy access to her Indian
empiref and the Pacific, for which the
Nicaragua canal was once so desired.
She no longer needs or cares for it. The
other maritime powers want it. and we
most of all. England docs not care a but
ton whether we build it or not. To. us it
has become indispensable, not for com
mercial reasons alone but from, considera
tions of national defense and security of
the highest order. That is just where we
now stand. â¢ . .
Some years since a company headed by
ex-Senator Miller was granted the right
to build the canal, and made elaborate
surveys of the route, on the basis or
which new construction plans were predi
cated. Recognizing modern changes, it
proposed a waterway capable of passing
vessels of the largest class. The com
pany having spent some five million dol
lars In preliminary work, demonstrating
the practicability of the enterprise, came
to Congress for assistance, and, for sev
eral successive sessions, bills for an Issue
of Government bonds for that purpose
were brought forward. These were, by one
device or another, delayed and postponed
until the company's right to do the work
lapsed. During all this time no suggestion
of fortifying the canal was heard, though
it was to be built with Gevernment
money. The objection was to private con
struction or ownership. More information
was asked and new surveys were called
for and ordered. Speaker Reed was op
posed to It and would not appoint a day
for its consideration. Mr. Cleveland was
hostile and General Harrison, though
friendly, rather lukewarm, and thus the
project languished. The Spanish war and
the Oregon's voyage around the Horn,
however, settled the last remaining doubt
in the public mind, and the present admin
istration has urged Congress to action, ac
cepting the idea of Government ownership
and control. This, of course, involved a
new convention with England to remove
the obstacle of our engagement to . the
contrary in the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
The surrounding conditions . had mean-,
time been so changed that no reason ap
peared why Great Britain should refuse
consent to such, and negotiations for that
purpose resulted in the Hay-Pauncefote
convention, to the terms of which I now
turn. They are in substance that England
waives her objection, based on the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty, to our building and
owning the canal, with the understanding
that Its other provisions are not thereby
impaired.
The canal Is to be open to all nations
on equal terms; it is to be protected by
both powers against violence and is to be
neutralized so as never to become the
theater of hostilities between any bellig
erents whatever. The old provision not
to colonize, occupy, fortify or' exercise
dominion over the surrounding territory
Is not repealed and Is retained. I am
unable to find objection to any of these
provisions. The suggestion that if we
build the canal we should be at liberty
to protect It against attack by fortifica
tions is plausible, but a little reflection
will show that it is plausible only. It. is
not consistent wita the agreement that
the canal shall be neutralized and placed
under the protection of the powers. Neu
trality and fortification are oovlously In
consistent with one another. Neutralizing
a particular district or territory, though
an outgrowth of modern civilization. Is
not a new thing In history. Belgium was
neutralized by agreement of the European
powers in 1533; her territory has never
since been the scene of hostilities though
before that time it was called "the cock
pit of Europe." Most of the great battles
of the French and English wars of the
eighteenth century were fought on what
is now Belgian territory, which has prob
ably absorbed more human blood and en
tombed more human bones than any. equal
area in Europe.
Slnce its neutralization not a shot has
been fired there In anger nor a blow been
struck. ~ Sedan, the greatest battle the
world has witnessed since Gettysburg,
was focused within five miles of the Bel
gian frontier, yet In the heat and confu
sion of that dire encounter and rout her
neutrality was respected by both bel
ligerents. Not a man of either army
crossed the line (though only marked by
a row of monuments) any more than If it
had been closed to access by a solid wall.
Switzerland has been neutral ground by
treaties at least since the peace of 1814.
and with like universal respect to her
boundaries. As late as 1863 the lonian
Islands, when ceded by England to
Greece, were neutralized by general
treaty; but preliminary to neutralization
the fortifications were directed to be de
molished. And why? Simply because neu
tralization forbids hostilities while fortifi
cation is a- distinct preparation for them;
the two things are entirely Inconsistent.
The nation that agrees to neutralize the
canal and at the same time proposes to
fortify It practically Intimates Its expec
tation, at some future convenient time,
to violate Its agreement for neutrality. .
And again consider "how oft the sight
of means to do 111 deeds makes deeds ill
done!" and the old proverb that the "op
portunity is what creates the thief."
Fortifications erected on or commanding
the canal would necessarily be under the
command of some military officer, prob
ably of - inferior rank. -whose - zeal might
easily, in case of a sudden call, outrun his
discretion- (as happened to Commodore
Wilkes, in the Trent case) and involve us
in hostilities, arising: from a violation of
our treaty obligations. * Even If we were
willing to trust' such persons impllcity,
we could not expect other nations to do
so. And thus we are driven . to make a
manly choice between fortifying the
canal, and \thus. closing It to. commerce
during every maritime war or neutrallz-

this city has procured the publication of
the Transvaal national hymn, the words
being translated Into English by Charles

The trial of the suit of the Government

Thomas Chandler, a deputy collector,
was shown a check for Jl2 30 as expenses

ANOTHER HOLE KNOCKED
IN THE NEW CHARTER
Judge Cook Decides That the State
Law Governs Issuance of
-;> " Bail Bonds.
San Francisco's new charter is begin
ning to look like the bottom of a colan
der. Still another hole was punctured in
the local organic law yesterday by a de
cision handed down by Judge Cook, in
which he held that the provision of the
charter making it mandatory for all bonds
for the release of persons charged with
crime to be secured by property In this
city and county and for the same to be ac
cepted by the bond and warrant clerk be
fore the prisoner could secure his release
was null. M.. Less, charged with obtain
ing money under false pretenses, appeared
before Judge Cook yesterday on a writ
of habeas corpus, sworn out on his be
half by a friend. His attorney, C. C. Na
gle, said that he had presented a bond to
the bond and warrant clerk for the re
lease of the defendant, but the same was
refused on the ground that the bondsmen
qualified by virtue of their possession of
property In the State, but not In the city
and county. Argument on the writ fol
lowed and Judge Cook decided that the
State law, which makes valid all bonds
legal and sufficient on which those quali
fying own property of sufficient value
anywhere In the State superseded the pro
vision of the charter and bond* in such
cases could only be accepted by the com
mitting magistrate or other Judge of
equal or superior jurisdiction. Judge
Cook instructed Nagle to present the bond
in question to a court of competent Juris
diction and in event of its non-acceptance
the writ would issue as prayed.
Later in the day the bond was present
ed to Judge Mogan. who accepted the
same and released the accused from cus
tody.

CHARLOTTE CORDAT.
her execution, with quill In hand looking
out earnestly from behind her prison bars,
has done much to hold popular judgment
in equilibrium. Was this sad-eyed, pure
faced young girl who deliberately took the
life of Marat a murderer or 1 a heroine?
She would undoubtedly have figured as a
classic, a feminine Brutus, in
"the glory that was Greece,
The irrandeur that was Rome."
But in this unimpaesloned twentieth cen
tury, looking' coldly back upon the fever
heat which burned itself out in France
100 years ago, who shall say whether
Charlotte Corday was sent by God to
avenge her country? In other words,
should the heroes of history be judged by
the standards of the day in which they
lived or gauged by modern criteria?
The youth of Charlotte Corday, like that
of Joan of Arc, was of the kind that fos
ters introspection, feeds imagination and
prolongs childhood Indefinitely. It was*
not 'mid her flocks on the hillsides, but in
the cloistered seclusion of tho abbayeâ
Aux Dames â founded at Caen for the
daughters of the poor nobility by Matilda,
wife of William the Conqueror, that Char
lotte Corday's mystic self-communings
took on that personal shape which beck
oned her to her doom. Here she devoured
whatever books came to her hand, absorb
ing greedily whatever savored of patriot
ism and equality of rights. While her mind
was in this vortex of ill-chosen reading
news reached her of the Increasing in
famy of Marat.
Marat, head of the Mountain, the ed
itor of the revolutionary- press, upon
which so many republican nopes had
been founded, the Incarnation of all that
was evil in the French revolution, had
by means of unparalleled atrocities
raised himself to the highest power in
his party. Danton and Robespierre, the
other members of this terrible triumvi
rate, were unable to satisfy Marat's un
quenchable thirst for blood. Incorrup
tible in money matters, he was neverthe
less one of the vilest of mankind. No He
was too monstrous, no atrocity too san
guinary, to debar his hideous progress.
His brain was turned by his immense
power. Even his adherents abhorred his
leprous body and livid leer, refusing to
sit near the blood-crazed demoniac whom
they had raised to power. He it was who
urged the. lmmediate execution of Louis
XVI and called upon his constituency to
kill 200 000- adherents of the old regime.
He even wished to reduce the convention,
the republican organ of the Government,
one-fourth by this same cruel measure.
The Girondists, who had forced Louis
XVI to become a constitutional king, had
been entirely superseded by Marat's ul
tra-revolutionary party, known an the
Jacobins. And now Marat's venom was
turned against the Girondists and he an
nounced in his Journal that 300,000 of their
head" were necessary to consolidate the
liberties of France. Surely if it ever were
right for men to usurp God's prerogative
of summoning a soul to the other world,
such a scourge upon mankind as Marat
would seem to justify the deed!
Upon the suppression of the convents
by the national convention Charlotte Cor
day returned to her home at Caen. Well
read in ancient history and versed In the
more modern principles of political econ
omy, she had expected the Girondists to
bring about an ideal- pure republic. When
Marat expelled them from the convention
Charlotte Corday, at the head of the
young girls of the city, went out to meet
those returning to Caen, and presented
them with crowns and flowers. \V lth her
father she attended their Indignation
meetings, but was disgusted by their
pusillanimity. Volunteers were called for
upon the field of Caen to lead an Insur
rectionary movement against Marat, but
so intimidated were they by Marat s lim
itless power for evil that but thirty re
sponded to the roll of the drum Then
Charlotte Corday realized for the first
time the terrorizing power of the head of
the French Government. . If he could
make so nerveless these men whom he
had wronged, he must rule by right of
terror alone, and she, Charlotte Corday,
who knew no fear, would rid her country
of this law-murderer, and Justice and
peace would return. It is said that at
first she debated with herself whether
France should be relieved of Marat or of
Robespierre, but the call of the former
for 100,000 more guillotine victims, com
bined with the testimony which the pro
scribed Girondists brought back to Nor
mandy, determined her to seek out Marat
without delay. - Â¦ â¢/
Â¦ She accordingly set forth for Paris, tak
ing no one into her confidence, but deter
mined to shoot Marat in the midst of the
Assembly. Finding that s she could not
carry out ' her ~ intention of killing him
before the people, like the classic heroines
nity, losing her Innocent serenity but
once, when Fouquler-Tinvllle insinuated
that she could not have killed her victim
so successfully had she not been accus
toming her hand to it. "Oh, the wretch!"
she exclaimed, in an astonishment that
took the courtroom by storm. "HÂ© takes
me for an assassin!" When the president
then asked how she could reach the heart
at the very first blow, she replied: "In
dignation had aroused ray heart and
showed me the way to his." The presi
dent tried to induce Charlotte Corday's
counsel to plead insanity, but she urged
premeditation so strongly that the presi
dent again tried to save her by omitting
in his charge to the Jury the clause, "with
criminal and contra-revolutionary de
signs." He was arrested and tried for
this suppression a few days later; but hla
efforts were unavailing, for she was con
demned to immediate execution.
While M. Haver, the artist, was painting:
her portrait the gendarmes entered with
the red robe which murderers wore at
their execution. She displayed no hesita
tion in putting it on. There was nothing
of the savage virago or coward about her.
for she was uplifted by the though*-that
by shedding- ,*he blood of one man and giv
ing up her' own In penalty therefor she
had saved the blood of thousands of her
countrymen. Robespierre. Damon and
Desmoulins, who 'had stationed them
selves on the road to the guillotine, were
amazed at her peaceful ana majesticcalxn
nes;. so unlike that of other victim:*, who
haÂ«l not quailed before tfce guillotine. y*t
had kept up their spirits with patriotic
sreeches and songs. A deputy from May
ence lest his reason â no uncommon ihin^
during the reign of terrorâ at si?ht of her
rcÂ£-robed teauty, radiant In the 3'inset,
and rrquested to be executed immediately
afterward that he might join "the woman
greater than Brutus" in another world.
111-* re-Quest was granted, but Charlotte
CorUay never knew of his singular Uevo
ti.ni
ShÂ« rcr.-iir.**-. 1 . the same unflinching calm
on the scxtfioM and showed no emotion e.x
cÂ«>pt that cf wishing to hurry the execu
tioner after he had arranged her clothing
for the guillotine. A minion of Marat's
struck her face a blow when the execu
tioner held it up to the mob, and it la a
well attested fact that she blushed and
looked with amazement upon his imper
tinence.
Charlotte Cordav's sacrifice fild not
bring 1 about the results for which It was
made. Upon tire death of Marat, who
would have died in a few months of his
loathsome diseases, the blood of Prance
flowed more freely than ever; in fact. It
was followed by some of the worst
atrocities of the reign of terror. David's
portrait of Marat with gaping: wounds
was exhibited on an altar in the
Louvre, and then in the convention, and
kept streams of blood flowing "to the
shades of Marat." For four dreadful
months the ax. grapeshot and drowning
"purged society" of thousands of its mem
bers. Finally friends and foes combined
to overthrow Robespierre and the end for
Â¦which Charlotte Corday had srlven her
life was reached at last. Of the wisdom
of her deed there are many grave doubts:
of her beauty, sincerity and purity of
character there is no question.

PAYMASTER DOWNEY
ATTACKED BY INSURGENTS
Beaten Sack After an Attempt to Rob
the Pay Wagon on a Steep
Mountain Trail.
News was received yesterday from Ma
nila of an exciting fight between Pay
master George F. Downey and his clerk,
Jerome Clark, and a band of Insurgents,
who sought to rob the pay wagon. Ma
jor Downey, with Clark and an escort
from Captain Davis' company of the
Thirteenth Infantry of fifteen men under
a corporal, was on his way from Candon
to Cervantes to pay a detachment of the
Thirty-third Infantry, which was near
Cervantes. The paymaster had over ten
thousand dollars with him. The party
had passed Salcedo, where they were told
the country beyond was clear of insur
gents, and were proceeding up a steep
mountain trail, when from both sides of
the trail the insurgents opened fire.
It was a complete surprise, but the es
cort deployed on either side of the wagon.
Major Downey and Clark drew their re
volvers and joined the troops, and for a
few minutes there was some lively
fighting.
The escort had no cover, nor could they
get any, for the Insurgents occupied the
rocks and underbrush on both sides of
the trail, but in spite of that they all
escaped without injury. The fusillade
came to an abrupt end by the with
drawal of the insurgents. They carried
their wounded with them, but they left
live dead by the trail. The paymaster
and his party proceeded on to Cervantes
without further molestation.
Major Downey is well known here In
San Francisco. He is a volunteer officer
who was assigned to duty with the head
quarters of this department in June of
1898. He served here for thirteen months
and then In July of 1599 he was ordered
to Manila, where he has bee.n since. His
clerk, Jerome Clark, is also known here
as an employe of .Wells. Fargo & Co.
While here he was a noted shot with ' a
rifle and revolver, and It is probable he
joined in the fight with a willingness that
had its effect upon the casualties.
UNION LEAGUE CLUB
NAMES A DELEGATION
Members Appointed to Represent
the League at Los Angeles
Convention.
The Union League Club committee on
political action met yesterday afternoon
to choose fourteen delegates to represent
the club in the State Republican League
Convention, at Los Angeles, April 27.
The delegates chosen were: Lieutenant
Governor Jacob Neff, Speaker Alden An
derson, Attorney General Tirey L. Ford,
J. C. Campbell, J. M. Gleaves. William M.
Abbott. Frank Coombs, D. E. McKinlay,
M. M. Estee, Thomas KJrkpatrick, Thom
as Flint Jr., George D. Clark, Daniel T.
Cole and Charles C Patton.
A. G. Booth, president; S. J. Hendy, sec
retary, and I. \V. Hellman Jr., treasurer,
of the Union League are ex-offlcio dele
gates. The delegation will therefore con
sist of seventeen members.
Tirey L. Ford, chairman of the com
mittee, predicted a big convention, as the
opening gun of the Presidential campaign
in California would be nred at Los An
geles on April 27.
H. Z. Osborne of Los Angeles, chair
man of the committee on transportation,
paid that the rate given to the Kn'ghfi
Templar would apply to delegates to tho
convention. This is a one and one -third
single rate for the round-trip.
Tirey L. Ford presided at the session of
the committee. The members attending
were: M. M. Estee, C. F. Bassett. J. M.
Gleaves, J. C. Currier, A. G. Booth, Part 3
Kilburn. Alden Anderson. J. H. Neff, 11.

AS was to be expected, the scare over
the bubonic plague raised by the
Board of Health of this city has
had its effect upon the business in
terests to such an extent that the
merchants have decided they must put
the matter plainly before the country.
At the time of the discovery of the first
sick Chinaman, it was' then the desire of
the press and the city officials, with the
exception of the Examiner and the Board
of Health, to let the matter rest until it
was seen that the city was infected, be
fore such news was given out. The Ex
aminer forced matters, however, and the
impression of its startling headlines here
and their reflection in the Journal in New
York was that San Francisco was in
fected. As a matter of fact it is not and
never has been infected, and this the
merchants want the country to know.
The matter has been taken up by the
Board of Trade. Its first step will be to
call a meeting of the various commercial
organizations to arrange for the wide dis
semination of the true- facts of the case
and. a refutation of the false reports that
reflect on the health of the city. â¢
A. A. Watkins, president of the Board
of Trade, has the matter in charge. He
says he hopes the newspapers and the
news agencies will support the mer
chants in their endeavor to have the true
state of affairs made known. President
Nelson of the Chamber of Commerce and
President Sbarboro of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association are both in
favor of- holding the meeting, and they,
too, hope for the support of the news
agencies. *
No date for the meeting has so far been
fixed, and there is no definite plan of ac
tion except that something must be done
or the reputation of the city will serious
ly suffer. It is possible, too, that before
the meeting may be called it will have
been decided to enlarge its, scope so as
to include all the members of all com
mercial organizations of the city.
The general sentiment among the mer
chants is that the whole affair has "been
a play to the grand stand and serious
only as it affects the business of the city.
Other contagious diseases, they point
out, are taken to the r Pesthouse without
ceremony or sensation, but in the case. of
one suspect the whole town is practical
ly quarantined, sensational reports are
sent out all over the country and the mer
chants have to pay the bill. They believe
the game has gone far enough and they
are going to have some say in the matter
themselves.

BY CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN. Â¦
VI. CHARLOTTE CORDAY.
(1765-17&3.)
Marie Anne Charlotte Corday d'Armans.
known to history as Charlotte Corday.
was born at Orne in 1768. Her life was
devoid of incident; her history lay in the
events leading up to her self-chosen death.
An example of cne of the many abnormal
accidents of the unnatural conditions en
gendered by tho French revolution, she
would probably long since have been con
signed to oblivion were it not for tho ro
mantic interest aroused' by the appeiling
portrait painted a few hours before her
execution.' The artist, Haver, privileged
to paint this* portrait upon, which the
later idealized pictures have been founded,
bears willing- testimony to the dlgnliled
simplicity of character and sweetness cf
soul which irradiated a countenance nat
urally beautiful. There is no doubt that
hers was an unusually lovely type of
beauty, quite different from that inva
riably ascribed to all sensational hero
ines who pay the death penalty. It is
probable that her most popular portrait,
painted by C. L. Muller, representing her
in the white mob cap made especially for
in the plays of her great-great-uncle,
Pierre CorneHle, she decided to purchase
a new weapon with which to dispatch
him at his home, for Marat was too ill
to go any more to the convention and ad
mitted no visitors. After buying a sharp
knife of a cutler she persuaded one Du
perret, a Girondist, to take her to Marat's
house; but both were denied admission.
She then wrote two notes to her victim,
declaring with the abnormal cunning
which the most simple-minded seem to
develop upon occasion that she had Im
portant secrets to disclose to him. Re
turning in the evening, she gained admit
tance while Marat was In his bath. Re
ferring to the Girondist Deputies- of her
neighborhood, he said that he would have
them arrested and executed the same day,
whereupon Charlotte OGrday plunged thÂ«
knife, which she had concealed In her
neckerchief, Into hla heart.
Having achieved what she achieved to
be a commendable action, she refused all
opportunities of escape and calmly await
ed arrest. She was not only willing but
anxious to sacrifice her life for the good
of her country. She was alarmed, how
ever, at the attacks of the infuriated mul
titude, who would have undoubtedly torn
her to pieces had she not been ably pro
tected by the Chief of Police. "Not that
I feared to die," she said, "but it was re
pugnant to my woman's nature to be torn
to pieces before everybody."
Before the revolutionary tribunal she
showed the same calm and modest dig-

Distress.
Missionary Barkentine Horning Star

Gaelic and Carmarthenshire
Sail for the Orient.
?
There has been some heavy weather
along the coast during the past fortnight,
and in consequence several vessels have
made port the worse for wear. The steam
schooner Tillamook was among the num
ber, and she is now repairing damages In
Oakland Creek. About the time the
steamer was in trouble the bark Highland
Light was catching It oft Humboldt Bay.
A fresh easterly gale was blowing and a
very high cross sea running. There was
in consequence a great strain on the
standing rigging and the foretopmast
backstay carried away. Almost immedi
ately the foretopmast went by the board
and took everything attached with it. The
main from the topgallant mast up fol
lowed the foretopmast. leaving the bark
practically dismasted. Captain McLure
decided to run for San Francisco in order
to make repairs and after much maneu
vering reached port yesterday afternoon.
The Highland Light was on her way from
Nanaimo. B. C, for Lahaina, H. L, with a
cargo of coal.
The American ship A..G. Ropes is ready
for sea and will probably sail to-day.
There is a great scarcity of A. B. s on the
coast and in consequence the Ropes had
to pay an advance on the regular deep
water rate in order to secure a nrst-class
crew. From here to Honolulu, where the
Ropes goes to load sugar for ' New York,
the rate is $25 a month, and from Hono
lulu the rate to New York is or was $20
a month. The Ropes pays $25 a month
clear to New York, and in consequence
Captain Rivers secured the pick of the
men on the beach. *
The missionary barkentine Morning Star
has changed hands, and instead of sailing
for the southern seas with a band of mis
sionaries next month she will leave for
Alaska with gold hunters. She has been
purchased by Captain Sherman, late of
the whaling steamer Thrasher, and with
her the ex-whaleman proposes to make
for a new diggings in the frozen north
known to him alone. Captain Sherman
has been very lucky as a whale hunter,
and now he boldly asserts that he is going
after something better than blubber and
will come home a millionaire.
The Morning Star is an auxiliary bark
entine, the mainmast being hollow and
serving as a funnel. A larger vessel is
required by the missionary society, so the
Morning Star has been sold and a new
vessel built in the East is now almost
ready to take her place. The Morning
Star is in Oakland Creek, and Captain
Sherman intends to begin at once getting
her ready for the voyage to the frozen

NEW YORK. March 23.â Bradstreefs Review
to-morrow will say: Some of the irregularities
are visible In the general trade and Industrial
situation, the results of the working of counter
currents In various lines, but taken as a
whole the general outlook retains the most en
couraging features noted for some time past
In these columns. Reports are favorable as to
retail distribution and as to collections from
Southern, Western and â¢ Northwestern markets
due to better weather. , Continued good rail
road returns, record-breaking merchandise ex
ports from New York, with signs of a re
sumption of heavy shipments of . iron to Fu
rope and good wheat and fruit crop reports
except from the Central West, are also feat
ures. An unfavorable element Is the predic
tion of a general strike of machinists, but it
Is possible more than Its proper weight has
been Â¦ given this threatened trouble. As off
sets to this condition, might Â¦be cited the
settlements of differences 'among 1 - the Â¦ lake
ore handlers, a vital, point in the Immense
business looked , for. the coming spring and
summer. , Advances in wages of â¢ soft i coal
miners, of stove molders and of other -work
ers allied to the Iron and, steel Industry would
seem to ' point Â¦to labor : conditions retaining
most of ' the favorable features which Â« have
made them subjects of * favorable v remark ' on
the present prosperity wave. Â¦ Â¦ , -
Foreign demand â¢ seems likely to play a moat

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 23.â Prices of stocks to-
C&y made continual but unavailing efforts to
etand up under the weight of heavy sales to
realize profits, but in the majority of In
ttances the l&st prices are below those of last
night. The whole list wa.s at one time higher
than last night and several stocks or groups
of stocks made a chow of aggressive strength.
But this Â«-emed to be due largely to manipu
lation to sustain the list in the interest of
those who were selling to take their profits.
This v.as notably the case in Baltimore and
Ohio preferred, which was pushed up nearly
2 poir.tji above last night. While the preferred
was thus rising heavy selling continued in the
common stock. All of those stocks which have
bwn most heavily bought in the last few days
were most largely sold to-day. Selling orders
came not only from the board-room traders,
but from outside sources, and London reversed
Its position of yesterday. London bought
pHg-htly of 6ome stocks, but the balance of
transactions on that account was on the side
c: sales. This had a decided sentimental In
fluence on fcpecuittlve opinion, as great hopes
were aroused by London's active buying that
sustained supjx>rt would be accorded to the
market from that source. There was nothing
In the nfÂ»Â« of the day to afford a clear ex
planation of the weakness beyonfi the natural
Â£et.ire to UJce profits. The local traction stocks
thowed Borne positive weakness and were
something of a drag on the market as was
Sugar. The local tractions were sold on re
nt-wed apprehension that a heavy tax would
L< levied under the new franchise tax law.
A sudden spurt to 164 1 i by Metropolitan after
having sold at 160 a few minutes before caused
rallies in this group, steadying the whole mar
ket. The weakness In Sugar was due to the
explicit announcement that recent negotiations
for a compn :r.ise of the trade war had been
abandoned. The Iron and steel stocks con
tinued dull and rather heavy on account of
the machinists' strike. There was some ap
prehension early in the day that the rate for
loans to carry over Monday would cause a
{â¢inch In the call money market, but this fear
proved groundless. Money continued In good
supply up to the close. The cash changes for
tbe weeic on various accounts t.u estimated
so nearly balance that the fate of the surplus
reserves will depend upon the changes In the
loan account. Tbe Bub-treasury has com
menced to disburse the premium on Govern
ment bonds deposited for conversion Into the
new 2s and as a consequence the lesses by
the banks tor the week on sub-treasury opera
tions are reduced to $1,187,000 and this Is al
most offset by receipts of gold from Canada
and other points. The shipments to the In
terior ere almost exactly offset by the re
ceipts. The profit-taking In governments has
tended to the reduction of loans of the banks,
but the renewed activity on the stock market
has created a demand for new loans. The
â¢ otion of the money market Indicates that the
banks are well within their limit of legal re
serve*.
The bond market was lesj active than yes
terrtay an.l yielded at some points In sympathy
with stocks. Total sales, par value. $2,555.000.
United States 2s advanced % and the re
funding 2g, when Issued, declined % In the
Lid price.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables unchanged.
Butter very weak, with heavier arrivals. j
Cheese and Eggs unchanged. \ yt
Poultry in sufficient supply and quiet.
Fresh and Dried Fruits as previously quoted.
No further change in Provisions.
Meat market stands tJie same.
Important part In the Iron and steel Industries,
judging from the reports of advancing foreign
markets and of increasing inquiries upon man
ufacturers. Some lots of pig iron are being
negotiated for at New York and at Blrmlng-,
ham. Ala., and Southern Iron prices would
appear to be ' on a parity with those abroad.
While some slight concessions might secure
much of the business nothing like a general
easing of values is to be reported. Bessemer
pig Is in fact firmer than ever at almost the
top price reached In the present boom. Foun
dry Irons, chiefly of low grade, are cheaper,
but finished products note little If any change.
Anthracite coal reflects the advanced season in
weaker quotations, but bituminous sorts are In
demand. The famine In coal In Europe seems
to be growing more pronounced, but some
rumored very large contracts for Southern coal
have yet to be placed.
Copper Is in good demand and some large
sales are reported for export demand and
firmer on the week, as are also hog products
on smaller receipts and a reported squeeze of
shorts. Sugar Is higher, mainly owing to the
growing strength of raw material.
Wheat and corn among the breadstuffs have
been . weaker, reflecting another . one of those
short swings in price which have been puch
a feature of the former market. In the Cen
tral West wheat crop advices are disappoint
ing; complaint of winter killing more than
offsetting Increased acreage.
Wool remains one of the soft spots In the
market, and though a great deal more bunlneos
haH been done this week than last concessions
are easier, to obtain and prices are quotably
lower. â¢ Leather, on the other hand, returns
a better report than for some time past, quo
tations of hemlock are higher and business has
been larger at several markets. The boot and
shoe Industry notes some Improvements in de
mand and prices, but hides remain rather dull.
Wheat, ' Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.903.495 bushels, against 2.727,
450 bushels last week, 3.746.761 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1839, 3.898.518 bushels In

Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
In its fair state of operation the new money
blll has given satisfaction at the treasury and
to banks. Applications for new 2 per cents
have exceeded $106,000,000 and the net increase
in bank circulation is already. over $10,000,000.'
As the rate at which- new circulation, can be
Issued is limited, except for banks which gave
orders in advance of the passage of the bill
and' the Issues at first are largely for the In
crease of notes to the par \-alue of bonds de
posited, little can yet be Inferred regarding
the other increase, though applications indicate
that it will be large for Interior banks. The
release of millions employed in preparation for
action under the new measure has caused in
bank returns' considerable changes, which are
nominal rather than real, and the money mar
kets are undisturbed. The reported settlement
of the Carnegle-Frick controversy Is one of
the greatest Importance to the iron and steel
industry. A fight between such forces would
In the end have affected prices and values
beyond calculation, while the combination of
Interests now said to be agreed upon may prove
revolutionary in its influence. Whether the
markets will be Immediately affected Is not
clear. As yet the tendency toward reaction
of prices continues, though in the PlttsburK
region bessemer and basic pig are strong. But
Eastern bessemer, gray forge and Southern
pig are sold there at prices below those gov
erning In large transactions and only the de
mand for steel-making Iron appears to exceed
the supply. Eastern markets are weaker, with
a reduction of $1 per ton at Philadelphia in
some grades. The finished products are gen
erally unchanged, though shots rise at Chicago
with the coming combination, while plates sink
lower at Plttsburg and to the lowest point
since April 6. 1899, at Philadelphia.
The London wool sales have shown a shade
more strength than those of last month and
considerable American purchases of lome
grades indicate the true position of the prices
asked here. Yet the markets here are called
stronger In tone, although of the sales re
ported much the greater part were at con
cessions and manufacturers are doing very lit
tle. Bales at the three chief markets are only
4.800,900 pounds, of which 3.771,500 were do
mestic. The state of the woolen goods mar
ket does not encourage manufacturers to pay
the prices now asked. There Is not only little
ground to expect an advance. In prices, but
in other than leading grades some concessions
are frequently made to secure transactions and
the business Is still disappointedly restricted.
The manufacturers have advanced hemlock
sole lc In spite of a further fall of 1H per
cent in hides at Chicago, making the decline
3 per cent within four weeks.
The advance in wheat which followed'state
ments of the quantity In farmers' hands has
not been maintained and the decline the past
week has been.lHc Cam also yielded about
Â«Ac. Atlantic exports were 1,753,028 bushels for
the week and for three weeks only 4,762.482,
against 8,730,374 last year. Receipts at West
ern points In three weeks have been 11,977,231,
against 10.150.957 last year.' Meanwhile Pacific
exports are heavy and In three weeks .have
been 3,183,543 bushels, against 1,656,277 last
year.
The foreign demand for corn still lessens.
Failures for the week have been 183 In the
United States, I against 200 last year, and 27
in Canada, against 24 last year.
Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK, March 23.â Bradstreet'a Finan
cial Review will say to-morrow:
Speculation has this week developed remark
abla activity and strength, the latter feature
being mainly confined to what Is known as the
standard railroad stocks. The principal factor
in the market has been the disappearance of
fears regarding the money market. -Last week's
bank statement showed a large decrease in the
Item of loans. Indicating that banks which had
purchased Government bonds for -the purpose
of convertinr them into new 2 per cents and
taking out circulation were paying oft these
borrowings. This process Is likely to be a rapid
one and the supply of money available for stock
market purposes has evidently Increased
Rates for call loans were, however only
slightly easier and the activity of the stock
market naturally tends to augment the demand
for funds. The feeling of the street in regard
to the financial outlook la nevertheless one of
confidence, and the disposition 'to discount the
effect of the currency bill upon the bank cir
culation has been marked. Large Interests
have consequently felt themselves able to give
support to their specialties, and at the same
time the public, both here and abroad, has
shown a readiness to participate in the move
ment. The amount of outside buying was con
siderably In excess of anything which the
market had witnessed for some months past
London has taken a favorable view of the
effects of the currency bill and of the position
of American railway properties. All of the
European markets are steady on the belief that
the war will soon terminate and there will be
no political complications of an international
character jrrowlng out of It. Consols have
shown an advance and American stocks were
features in the rise of values. It has been some
time since London has been such a large pur
chaser In this market, its buying of Atchlson
the Pacifies. Baltimore and Ohio and other
London specialties producing an Impression up
on the exchange market, which - has been de
cidedly weak In consequence of offerings
of bills against this foreign buying. The sud
den announcement of the purchase of the
Third-avenue road by the Metropolitan
Street Railway and the sensational^ ad
vance of more than 60 points in the
former stock not only demoralised the bear
party In the street, but created for a time
more or less fear that trouble mleht arise In
connection with the short Interest In the stock
No actual difficulties, however developed In
this connection, and the action of Third-avenue
led tt> covering of shorts In other direction,
and sided materially In stimulating public in
terest as to other parts of the list.

FOUGHT FOR A DAY
ON ETHICS AND LAW
Varney Estate Attorneys Close
Â¦Contest Over Disqualification.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, March 23.
COLD, hard law was doled out in
large packages to-day by the em
inent attorneys in the Varney es
tate case, who are trying to have
each other disqualified from acting in the
trial of the trust contest. Opinion after
opinion dug out of the musty past of
English jurisprudence, supplemented by
tsuch authority from the American
courts, was hurled at the heads of Judge
Ogden and Judge Ellsworth, with whom
It now rests to decide whether the firm
of Bishop & Wheeler has been guilty of
unprofessional conduct which disqualifies
it from appearing for the beneficiaries
under the will of the late Thomas Varney.
ThÂ«re also rests with the same occu
pants of tho bench the Question now sub
mitted whether Attorney William S.
Goodfellow, who made the extraordinary
accusations against Guy C. Earl, has not
placed himself in such a relation to the
contestants that he is interested in both
eldes of the litigation and is therefore
himself legally disqualified from appear
ing in the case. Attorney Wheeler made
good his notice of last evening and by
formal motion based upon a lengthy
statement of position submitted that
phase of the sensational fight to the
court.
Occasionally during to-day'e hearing
there were wordy tilts between Attorneys
Wheeler and Goodfellow, but there was
little to relieve the heaviness of discus
sion on the scores of legal technicalities
which were drawn to thread-like con
clusions on both sides.
During the morning hours Mr. Goodfelr
low found time to give expression to con
siderable Indignation that the opposing
forces had moved upon him last evening
without what he considered ample notice.
Attorney Wheeler sharply replied that
the charges against himself and the other
members of his firm had been made last
Tuesday during his absence from court.
as well as Mr. Karl, who was particularly
attacked.
"I gave due notice to Mr. Rlx and Mr.
Tr*at," declared Mr. Goodfellow.
"Yes, thirty seconds' notice," they re
torted.
"You could have asked for a postpone
ment." he suggested.
Then Mr. GoodfelloW had some mis
Â¦understanding about his position,' and
after everything was fairly well cleaned
up Attorney Wheeler went to the argu
ment he started yesterday in opposition
to the accusations.
He asserted at the outset that the rec
ords of the testimony taken before Judge
Ellsworth in the accounting five years
ago of the Varney estate trust belonged
as much to the beneficiaries of the estate
which he represented as to the trustees,
Mr. Goodfellow's clients. And he hinged
the major portion of his argument on that
point. Incidentally, Mr. Wheeler pointed
out much law which, he asserted, favor
ed his view of the relations existing be
tween the parties interested in the trust.
"The first boomerang has already ap
peared In this matter," declared Mr.
Wheeler, "and the second is in the au
thorities which point out the Indelicacy
of Mr. Goodfellow's position In fighting
STAACKE NO LONGER
MANAGES BELL ESTATE
Bemoved From His Position as Ex
ecutor Pending Investigation of
Charges Against Him.
George EtaacXe. the sole surviving ex
ecutor of the will of the late Thomas Bell,
has been deposed, and Mrs. Theresa Bell
will make an effort to save a email dowry
out of the wreck of the dead millionair'j's
estate. In the order made by Judge Ccf
fey yesterday removing Staacke and ap
pointing Mrs. Bell, decedent's widow, spe
cial administratrix, the court said: #I li
appearing to the court that there Is rea
son to believe that George Staacke has
wasted and mismanaged the property of
the estate committed to his charge, and
has committed fraud upon the estate an!
hap wrongfully neglected the same, hence
It lo ordered that his powers be suspended
until the matters alleged In the petition
are Investigated." â
Judge Coffey gave Mrs. Bell authority
to take up the management of the ent-re
estate. He provided, nowever, that she
take all negotiable securities and place
them in tbe vaults cf the California Safe
Deposit and Trust Company, and ordered
that ail rents coming from estate prop
erties should also be deposited there. Her
bonds were fixed at J25.0U0.
For many months Mrs. Bell has been
complaining that Staacke was managing
the estate of his late partner, . Thomas
Bell without due regard for her and (n
his 'own interest. The charges will now
be Investigated, and if the allegations of
decedent's widow are proved the deve op
rnents will be in .the line of sensational.

HO YOW ASKS FOR FAIR
TREATMENT OF CHINESE
Consul General Claims Merchants
Axe Unjustly Prevented From
Entering United States.
Consul General Ho Vow Ib seeking to
enlist the support of the merchants of
San Francisco in his efforts to secure a
more liberal ruling by the Treasury De
partment in the matter of the admission
of Chinese merchants to this country.
Yesterday afternoon the Consul General
addressed a representative gathering of
the business men of the city, who as
sembled in the rooms of the Chamber of
Commerce in â¢ response to invitations
issued by him.
Ho Vow spoke briefly. Impressing upon
his auditors that his object was primarily
to secure the free and unrestricted entrj
of bona fide Chinese merchants into this
country to the end that the commerce be
tween the United States and China might
be fostered and built up.
Attorney John Bennett on behalf of the
Consul General read an exhaustive state
ment cf the unfair restrictions enforced'
by the Treasury Department to the injury
of the Chinese merchants. He was fol
lowed by Colonel John P. Irish, H. Mc-
Allister, R. P. Schwerin and William
bwain, all of whom advocated a more lib
eral policy In dealing with the Chinese
immigration question. It was stated that
the present exclusion law was not in
tended to exclude the merchant and pro
fessional classes from landing on our soil
and that Its fair administration would ac
complish all that was asked.
It was shown that the Chinese mer
chants of this city pay nearly one-third
of the import duties collected at this port
and that the trade with China is almost
wholly in their hands.
A committee consisting of R. p
Schwerin, William Swain, William Har
ries and John Bennett was appointed to
formulate a plan of action whereby re
strictions against Chinese merchants : may
be removed. â¢ .

ORPHEUM' S BUNCH
OF GOOD THINGS
ft HAVE had only fleeting glimpses of
'the Orpheum stage during the past
II three weeks, but this has been enough
to convince me that the programmes
have been up to standard. When all else
fails one can go to the Orpheum. with the
certainty of being diverted. It is very
handy, indeed, to have such a place to at
tend.
Having been previously denied the com
fort of an evening at the Orpheum I sat
the programme through last night and
found it the best that has happened in
some time. | There is entertainment tucked
away in every act and- ail the laughter
that one may long for.
Only the managers know how difficult
It is to keep up to a high standard of vau
deville and only the out-and-out laymen
rind fault with a bill that is not amazing
ly good from beginning to end. I believe
in crediting the management of such a
house as the Orpheum with a conscien
tious effort to give the public the best at
tractions obtainable.
If there has been an occasional "gold
brick" In the bill of fare the management
is not an accessory, but is more the victim
than you or I. As I said once before, the
bad ones are given short shrift and, un
like the fictional feline, they never come
back. .
The current bill is headed, If there can
be said to be a distinct head, by Walter
Jones and Norma Whalley, who have
much that Is new and comic in songs and
business. Walter Jones' travesty on Sou
sa Is easily the best of many essays of
the kind and Miss Whalley is in the same
class with himâ the first. Â»
The Misses. McCoy and Sam Marion are
dancers with enough grace and original
ity to do more than hold the eye; there is
something more than skill In their act,
which Is novel and Intelligent.
Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew humorize In
a snappy sketch and Weston and Yost
do something quite new in the way of a
dialogue between one of the pair, who has
the stage, and the other, who peddles
songs in the auditorium. Their "stuff" is
brisk and a very good sample of the great
American josh. A little polishing would
Improve the quality of their wit and that
I think may be looked for before they
make the round of the circuit.
If I have not already said that the whole
programme was good I must do so now

Dr. Curry of Tem<?3cal officiated at the
ceremonies held at the Mountain View
Cemetery-
the beneficiaries of this estate, for whom
he is in equity the attorney.'"
In concluding. Mr. Wheeler said: "In
an application of this kind and character
it would not be out of place to make some
allusion to the reciprocal relation of the
bench and bar. To the Judge on the bench
there la nothing more dear than to know
he has the confidence of the community
in which he lives and rears his family.
Does this apply with any less force to
that profession of which confidence la the
keystone? A reputation for unprofes
sional conduct or of even a suspicion
would cause a member of the bar to be
looked at askance by clients, by brother
lawyers and by Judges themselves. On
that ground an attorney should hesitate
long before he steps into court and makes
such charges.
"If there has been anything unprofes
sional or suggesting even indelicacy your
Honors' duty is a plain one. I do not
stand here to say to the court that we
ask for mercy. I stand with the full pride
of my profession, holding my head aloft
with the gentlemen who are my asso
ciates. We ask you for no Quarter. We
ask you for the law."
Mr. Goodf ellow replied that he consid
ered as ridiculous the assertion that he
was appearing for conflicting Interests. He
said he bad announced his withdrawal as
attorney for Thomas H. B. Varney Jr. in
dividually, and that he was confirmed in
his position that his motion should prevail.
Judge Ellsworth made some queries con
cerning Goodfellow's theory about the
transcript of testimony being a priviUgad
communication. The reply was: "I am
grateful to your Honor for asking ques
tions. The trouble with the Supreme
Court is that they do not ask questions,
and then decide a case on some point that
is not argued."
Judge Ogden later during Mr. Goodfel
low's argument said:
"If this motion is decided adversely to
you, Mr. Goodfellow, will you be ready to
go to trial on Tuesday?"
Mr. Goodfellow was rather startled at
the question, but announced that he might
like to ask for delay in such a contin
gency.
Referring to Mr. Treat, Attorney Good
fellow said he was satisfied to take that
attorney's testimony as to his connection
with the case.
"But Ido not apologize." he added. "It
was the inference at the beginning of tlils
hearing that Treat came into the Â¦ case
through' Information given- by Mr. Eari.
I made the motion on facts as they then
appeared to exist."
Mr. Wheeler directed attention to tha
fact that Mr. Treat's testimony upset that
theory, and concluded:
"But we are not insisting that Mr. Good
fellow must apologize
At the conclusion of the argument Mr.
Wheeler presented his motion against tho
appearance of Mr. Goodfellow at the trial,
and after setting forth with much detail
his grounds, had Attorney Goodfellow tes
tify concerning his relations as attorney
for the trustees, showing that since 1595
he had acted in that capacity.
"1 decline to argue or to discuss this
motion as unworthy of notice," announcsJ
Mr. Goodfellow.
"It seems to me it requires no discus
sion," were Mr. Wheeler's last words.
Â¦ No announcement was made as to the
time a decision would be rendered.

DYING SOLDIER'S
MESSAGE TO HIS
PROMISED WIFE
His Mother Seeks in Vain
for Trace of Her Son's
Sweetheart.
Mystery of the Existence and Dis
appearance of Mabel Lowry.
May Have Entered a
Convent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 23.
A mother has been trying for several
months to give the dying message of her
son to 'the young lady, who would have
been her daughter-in-law had not a Fili
pino bullet taken the Jlfe of Corporal Guy
B. Soden outside of Manila. , But though
an earnest search has been made for
many months the mother has been unsuc
cessful in her search. Mrs. Kate B.
Soden, the mother, has finally given up
her search and taken the body of her son
back to her home in Rid&efleld., Wash.
The mls3ing young lady is Miss Mabel
Lowry, and of her not the slightest trace
can be found.
Guy B. Soden was a corporal in the
Fourteenth United States Regular in
fantry, in which, he enlisted at the very
outbreak of the Spanish war. He went
out with the first expedition to the Philip
pines, entered Manila with General Mer
ritt and afterward engaged in the war.
wltn the insurgents. He was wounded at
the battle of Blockhouse 14 and died from
his wound.
When he was dying he asked a wounded
friend who was near him to take a mes
sage to his mother and to the young lady
who he said would have been Mrs. Soden
had he lived. The wounded friend, I Ben
Harbor, came to Oakland pome time ago
and delivered the message to Mrs. Soden.
Together with the mother he searched for
Miss Mabel Lowry, but without avail.
They heard â¢ that Miss Lowry had left
her home in Kansas, where the Sodens
once lived, and had started for Manila to
Join the young soldier, and that upon her
arrival in San Francisco she had been met
with the story of- his death. She was said
to have entered a convent, but there is no
record to that effect. But strangest of all
is that the last letter that Mr?. Soden re
ceived from her son before he sailed out
of San Francisco harbor was indorsed
upon the back, "Mailed by your future
daughter-in-law." This would seem that
Miss Lowry was in San Fmncisco before
young Soden left, but still no trace of her
can be found. Mrs. Soden writes:
"We have never been able" to find Mabel
Lowry, though We have searched in every
direction. Ben Harbor, wiro brought us
Guy's last words, says that that was the
name Guy gave him, but we have never
been able to find her address in any of
Guy's books or papers. We wrote to one
address we found there, but It proved to
be another young lady who had simply
met him. The last letter we got from Guy
was written at the Presidio. On the back
of the envelope was written. 'Mailed by
your future daughter-in-law.' We would
like to find Miss Lowry. so that we can
give her Guy's last message and thank
her for her kindness to our boy."
DRIFTING DOWN
THE COLORADO
ON FLATBOATS
" Â¦ ? Â¦ Â¦Â¦';." - *
Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Moore Jr.
Plan a Very Unusual
Will Visit the Town of Blytheâ Mr.
Moore to Retain His Position in
the Attorney General's
Office.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 111S Broadway, March, 23.
A very small and a very select party will
make a very.' long and a very unusual trip
in a few weeks. The party will be com
posed of A. A. Moore Jr. and his wife,
formerly. Florence Blythe,. and j Dr. . J. P.
Dunn, one of the leaders of the medical
fraternity of Alameda County. The trip
Is a duplicate of x the now famous drift
made by young Lelter of Chicago down
the Colorado River. .â¢;Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦
It is not an idle desire to take an un
usual trip that prompts the party, but an
examination of a map of California will
show that in the extreme eastern end of
Riverside County, almost on the banks of
the Colorado River, there is the town of
Blythe. The map does not show any other
settlements in the neighborhood, and It Is
in a section that is hardly regarded as a
populous one. But many years ago
Thomas Blythe, the father of Mrs. Moore,
invested heavily in that section of the
country. S He purchased something like
50,000 acres of land and spent a small for
tune in building a series of irrigating
ditches through the land. He knew that
It was good land, and that with irrigation
it would be Immensely valuable. He act
ually began to cultivate it, and the town
of Blythe was founded, when he died.
During the litigation over his estate this
great property was almost forgotten. It
was so far out of the usual paths and so
difficult of access that few of the litigants
or managers of the property ' ever : saw it,
and as tp its exact condition there is con
siderable doubt even to-day.
So it is that Mr. and Mrs. Moore have
decided to visit the property and see it for
themselves, and the easiest way to reach
it is to take flatboats and drift down the
river to Blythe, tie up there and then take
to the boats again and continue the trip
to Yuma. Dr. Dunn, the warm personal
friend of Mr. Moore, will accompany the
couple. The trip will occur immediately
upon the closing of the southern session
of the Supreme Court at Los Angeles,
which Mr. Moore will attend as Deputy
Attorney General. Mr. Moore, who has
proven one of the most efficient assistants
of Attorney General Ford, in the criminal
department in particular, has reconsidered
his resignation. Harry A. Melvin will be
come a candidate for the Superior bench
of Alameda County, should Judge W. E.
Greene receive the appointment to the
proposed Federal Judgeshlp of Hawaii, as
now seems probable.
ALAMEDA BOYS
TAUGHT TO SEW
Use of Needle arid Thread Be
comes Part of Their Curriculum
in the Public Schools.
TROUBLES OP RISING! KNIGHTS OP THE NEEDLE.
57T? LAMEDA, March 23.â "Teacher, Johnnie Jones hooked my needle case."
I\\ "Please, may I have the emery bag from Tommy Tompkins?" "Please,
Ir â <\do you cut button-holes on the bias?" : c
These are samples of the questions that now fly back and forth In
Alameda schoolrooms since sewing has been added to /the curriculum of the
department. without regard to whether the pupil be male or female. No one
seems to know exactly how sewing came to be taught to the boys of Ala
meda, for it Is not down in the lists, but seems to have been added by the
principals of some of the schools. ? Now the male youth of Alameda is walk
ing about town, with fingers stuck full of holes, and talking about "O O
needles" and cutting things on the bias, and "darn" has become a popular ex
clamation. â¢ 'â¢ -' â¢ ' .
There Is going to be a series of explanations at the next meeting of the
Board of Education over the matter. ; The people of Alameda are divided upon
the utility of the work. .
"There Is no telling when sewing will come in handy," said Judge A. F. St.
Sure. "Sometimes a button gets off, whether you are married or not, and
It most always come In handy to. know how to get It back." "Sewing Is a
good thing to know how to do. especially In politics," said State Senator Tay
lor. "If you only know how to sew your enemies up you are all right. A po
litical sewing school would be a big thing."
"A stitch .in time saves nine," said Joe Lanktree, "If you only know when
and how to take that stitch. I wish I had known how to take It last spring."
JOYOUS BAPTISTS TO
REDEDICATE CHURCH
Exercises Began Last Evening With
a Beoeption and Will Con
: tinue Sunday.
The members of the First Baptist
Church and their friends gathered in the
church edifice last evening to begin the
exercises of rededication, which will be
continued next Sunday morning and even
ing. The church structure was burned
last' October. The new building looks
much as it did before the flre ana Â« the
programme that was Issued last evening
emphasized this fact, the exception being
the lack of the old tall spire. Last night s
exercises were largely informal. There
was a church reunion and roll can, at
which the pastor, Rev. E. A. woods.
D. D., presided." Then came a reception
and social hour. .
The exercises on Sunday will open at
11 a. m., when the pastor will deliver^ a
sermon. The trustees will report that the
church building is rededlcated entirely
free from debt. Special music will be fur
nished. The first Sunday-school service
will be held at 12:30. In the evening there
will be a praise service and a Christian
Endeavor service. At the praise service
congratulatory . addresses will be de
livered. ' ;
IROQUOIS BRAVES ON
EVIL OF IMPERIALISM
Debaters Insist That United States
Constitution Must Be Supreme
in "All American Territory.
The Iroquois Club discussed Imperialism
last night and came to the conclusion that
the national government must accept the
proposition of giving the newly acquired
territories the same laws and privileges
which the States and Terrtories of the
Union enjoy or retire from the enormous
te . r /ii tory which was acquired in the war
' wl *r s ? am - The particular proposition
under debate was the following: VRe
i?l\i x oohT h . at } he u constitution of the
United States is the supreme law, not
alone in, the States, but also in all the
territories of the United States, whether
organized or unorganized, and any law,
order, decree or regulation*ln conflict with
its provisions Is a usurpation of authority
a r m . enace J fÂ° constitutional liberty."
* The n,,? dln f, participants in the debate
were Clitus Barbour, Charles Gildea- and
A. IJ. Lemon. They advanced no argu
ments An opposition to imperialism that
are not already well known and frequent
ly urged. Their remarks were followed
by a general discussion in which nearly
every speaker contended that colonial de
velopment of the United States must be
njfde within the field left open by the con
stitution of the United States

Future of California.
| Which way. do your intertsts lie? Which
way, do the Interests of California and
the city of. San Francisco He?
Three or four : days ago, Â¦ when your
president .honored me with the summons
I am now obeying, there came back to me
a vague memory of the visions cherished
by the men you rate the highest in Cali
forniaâyour pioneers and forty-ninersâ
as to the future of the empire they were
founding on this coast.
Here, for example, was Mr. William A.
Howard, whom I found declaring not
quite a third of a century ago that San
Francisco would yet be the largest Ameri
can city on the largest ocean of the world.
And here again was Mr. Delos Lake
maintaining that the "United States Is
now on a level with the most favored na
tions; that its geographical position, its
line of palatial steamers established on
the Pacific Ocean by American enterprise,
and soon to be followed by ocean tele
graphs, must before long render this
continent the proper avenue of com
merce between Europe and Asia, and
raise this metropolis of the Pacific to the
loftiest height of monetary power"
There was a reason, too, widely held
by the great men of the day, whose names
have passed into history, for some such
faith. Thus, an old Californlan of high
and happy fameâ Major General Halleckâ
speaking of San Francisco, said: "Stand-
Ing here on the extreme western verge of
the republic, overlooking the coast of Asia
and occupying the future center of trade
and commerce of two worlds Â» â¢ â¢ jf
that civilization which so long has moved
westward with the star of empire is now.
purified by the principles of true Chris
tianity, to go on around the world until
it reaches the place of its origin and
makes the Orient blossom again with its
benign influences, San Francisco must be
made the abutment and international law
the bridge by which it will cross the Pa
cific Ocean. The enterprise of the mer
chants of California has already laid the
foundation of the abutments; diplomacy
and steam and telegraph companies -are
rapidly accumulating material for . the
construction of the bridge." Thus far
Halleck. But have the Californians of
this generation abandoned the bridge?
Are we to believe these men of to-day
who tell us it Is not worth crossing?
Spirit of Forty-Nine.
Let no man fancy that these somo
tlmes exuberant expressions of a noblo
and far-seeing faith by your own pre
decessors and by a prescient foreigner
have been revived In derision, or even In
doubt. Those were the days when, if some
were for a party, at any rate all were for
the State. These were great men, â¢ far
seeing, courageous,. patriotic, the men of
'49. who in such lofty spirit and with such
high hope' laid the foundation of this em
pire on the Pacific. Distance did not dis
turb them, nor difficulties discourage. -
Has the race shriveled under these sum
mer skies? Has it grown old beforo Its
time? Is its natural strength abated' Are
the old energy and the old courage gone'
Has the soul of this people shrunk within
them? Or is It only that there are str'dent
voices from California sounding across the
Sierras and the Rockies that misrepresent
and shame a State whose sons are not
unworthy of their fathers? * .. '. ,

Henry Klint died suddenly Thursday
afternoon a few hours after he had made
a futile effort to save his fifteen-year-old
son Robert from a term In prison. Kline
was subject to heart disease and it is pre
sumed that the excitement and sorrow at
tending his son's trial before Judge Law
lor hastened his demise. The boy was
committed to the Whittier Reform School
until he reaches his majority.

Cause of Our Prosperity.
San- Francisco Is exceptionally prosper
ous now. So â¢is the State of California.
Why? Partly, no doubt, because you are
sh..rlng the. prosperity which blesses the
w-iolo country. But. is that all? What
Is the increase in the shipping â¢at your
wharves? What was me meaning of tnose
crowded, columns of business- statistics
your newspapers proudly printed last New
Year's; wnat the significance of the . in
crease In exports ana imports, far beyond
mere army requirements? Why is. every
room taken in your, big buildings? What
has crowded your docks, filled your streets,
quickened your â¢ markets, rented your
stores and dwellings, sent all this new
blood pulsing through your veins, made
you like the worn Richelieu when. In that
moment, there ! entered his spent veins
the might of France? Â¦
Was. It. the rage you, have witnessed
among some of your own leaders against
everything, that has been done the past
two years; the warning against everything
that is to be done? Was it the proof of
our unworthiness and misdeeds, to which
we all penitentially , listened, as so elo
quently Bet forth from the high places of
light and leading ; the demonstration that
what we needed was to sit under the live
oaks and "develop the individual man,"
nor dare to look beyond; the forgetfulness
that muscles grow strong only with exer
cise; that it Is the duties of manhood that

CHARTER DAY AS CELEBRATED AT THE UNIVERSITY.
there Is happily not a shade of difference
or opinion among the seventy-flve millions
of inhabitants. .- Nor was the free-trade
remedy so vehemently recommended, im
portant enough in itself- to provoke seri
ous objection or delay.
Btyond and above all, give her the best
system for her situation and wants,
whether it be our Dingley tariff or some
other, because it is the best for her and
is therefore our duty: not because it i#
ours, and therefore under. the constitution
of the United States her right. Th* ad
mission of that ill omened and unfounded
claim would be at the bar of politics a
colossal blunder, at the bar of patriotism
a colossal crime.
Admission of the Island.
But it is said that Porto Rico deserves
admission anyway, because we are bound
by the volunteered assurance of General
Miles that they should have the rights of
American citizens, perhaps; though there
is no evidence that he meant more or they
thought he meant more than such rights
as American ' citizens everywhere enjoy,
even in the District of Columbiaâ equal
laws, trial by jury, the writ of habeas cor
pus, local self-governmentâ ln a word, the
civil rights which the genius of our Gov
ernment secures to all under our control
who are capable of exercising them. If he
did mean more, or if they thought he
meant more, did that entitle him to antici
pate his chief and override in casual mil
itary proclamation the supreme law of
the land, whose commission he bore? Or
dld.it entitle them to suppose that he
cftuld? Behind Porto Rico is Cuba and
behind Cuba are all the other West
Indies, and the famous law of polit
ical gravitation which John Quincy Ad
ams prophetically announced three-quar
ters of a cenutry ago will then be acting
on them with ever-increasing force. And
behind them, not ahead of themâ abreast
of Porto Rico Itselfâ stand the Philippines.
Regard, I beg of you, in the calm white
light that befits these cloistered retreats
of sober thought, the degradation of the
republic .thus coolly contemplated by the
men who assure us we have no possessions
whose people are not entitled under our
constitution to citizenship and ultimately
to statehood! The Republican institutions
we have been trained In constitute a sys

eyes of the highest judge a man's life is
of no account if his short space of exist
ence has not tended to make the world
better.
"There, has been founded here at the
gate of the West an institution of the
noblest public spirit. The State has
created the university and left it to the
care and love of Californians. The uni
versity Is not the place for the engender
ing of private power and gain. It does
not exist for private interest, but for the
interest of the community. It does not
exist as the special tool for the use of any
one man. It exists that it may provide
good and noble citizens."
Whitelaw Reid Warmly Greeted.
Then the speaker of the day, Whitelaw
Reid, was introduced, amid the prolonged
cheering and handclapplng of the audi
ence. For an hour he spoke to those as
sembled and held their interest and at
tention to the very end. His subject was
"National Questions." With masterful
treatment and an eloquence simple and
straightforward he discussed his theme
along broad lines. At the conclusion ct
his speech cheer after cheer came from
the students as a tribute of honor to the
university's guest.
In part Mr. Reid's speech follows:
My subject has been variously stated in
your different newspapers as "Current
National Questions" or "The Present Na
tional Question" or "General Expositions;
Not on Anything in Particular," When
your president honored me with his invi
tation to a duty so high and so sudden
that it might almost be dignified by the
name of a draft he gave me nearly equal
license. I was to speak "on anything
growing out of the late war with Spain."
How that war resembles the grippe!
You remember the medical definition by
an authority no less high than our present
distinguished Secretary of State. "The
grippe," said Colonel Hay, "is that dis
ease in which, after you have been cured,
you get steadily worse every day of your
convalescence!" There are people of so
little faith as to say that this exactly de
scribes the late war with Spain!
If one is to speak at all of its present
aspects, on this high day of your uni
versity year, he should do so only as a
patriot, not as a partisan. But he cannot
avoid treading upon ground where the
ashes ere yet warm, and discussing ques
tions which in spite of the present inter
mingling of party lines and confusion of
party ideas, will presently bo found the
very battle-ground of campaign oratory
and hostile hosts. You will credit me, I
hope, witn sufficient respect for the pro
prieties of this platform to avoid marked
partisan argumentsâ even though, fortified
by the express warrant of your dis
tinguished president to discuss national
questions from any point of view that a
patriot can take. â¢ . â¢ .
New Lands Ours to Hold.
The new territories in the West. Indies

On these points I make bold to repeat
what I felt warranted in saying, a
fortnight ago within sight of Bunker Hill
that there is every evidence that the
American people have distinctly and
definitely made up their minda.
The American people know that they'
are thus proceeding to do Just what Jef
ferson did in the vast region he bought
from Franceâ without the consent, by the
way, either of its sovereign or its inhab
itants. They know that they are follow
ing in the exact path of all the construc
tive statesmen of the republic, from the
days of the man who wrote the declara
tion and of those who made the consti
tution, down 'to the days of the men- who
conquered California, bought Alaska and
denied the right of self-government to
Jefferson Davis. They simply do not
believe that a new light has been given to
the present apostles of a little America,
greater and purer than was given to
Washington or to Jefferson, or to Lin
coln.
Past Cannot Be Changed.
So I venture to affirm without qualifica
tion or reserve, that what is past cannot
be changed. Candid and dispassionate
minds knowing the American people of
all political shades and in all sections of
the country, can see no possibility that
any party in power, whether the present
one or its. opponent, would or could now
or soon. If ever, abandon or give back
one foot of the territory gained In the late
war. ... .
But In. all these constitutional discus
sions to which we are referring one clause
in the constitution has been curiously
thrust aside. The framers placed it on
the very forefront of the edifice they were
rearing, and there declared for our in
struction and guidance that "the people
do ordain and establish this constitution
â¢ â¢ â¢ to promote the general welfare."
By what right do statesmen now venture
to think that they can leave our national
interests out of the account? Who and
where is the sentimentalist who arraigns
ub for descending to too sordid a level

INT the new assembly hall of the Uni
versity of California, with a new di
rector of its fortunes presiding over
the exercises and a new spirit of pro
gTPss animating students and fac
ulty alike, the thirty-second charter day
anniversary of that institution was cele
brated yesterday morning and afternoon
In a manner that will nuke the occasion a
memorable one in the history of the uni
versity.
Simple and impressive were the charter
day exercises in the morning. On the pro
gramme was nothing more than a few
musical selections, a prayer, a benedic
tion, an introductory speech by President
Wheeler aud an address by Whitelaw
Reid, the distinguished editor of the New
York Tribune ajitf formerly United States
Minister to France. It was the spirit back
of the prayer, the benediction and ad
dresses that told of a new order and a
new atmosphere.
This charter day was celebrated In a
multiform manner. The exercises in the
morning were but the beginning of a
eeries of specially arranged entertain
ments. On the li*"-ld and track the ath
letic spirit of the students manifested it
self In races and a. baseball game. The
alumni, gathered from all parts of the
State, met in formal session, pledging
themselves to work heart and soul for the
betterment of the university. Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, to whom the work of regenera
tion is in a great measure due, entertained
the regents and Whitelaw Reid, the guest
of honor, at a luncheon. In the evening
the formal reception to Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, postponed for many months,
â¢was a brilliant ending of the president's
first charter day in his capacity as head
of the University of California.
Assembly Hall Packed.
At 11 o'clock, the hour set for the be
ginning of the exercises, the assembly
haJl, which is the Harmon Gymnasium
greatly enlarged by an addition which
Mrs. Hearst's beneficence secured for the
university, was packed to the doors. The
etudents formed in line according to their
classes, marched from North Hall to the
gymnasium and took their specially re
served Beats, being followed by the august
and dignified' regents and members of the
faculty. President Wheeler and White
law Reid led the procession up the -main
aisle a till on to the stage. Among those
Â¦who occupied places on the platform were
IX O. Mills. Rev. Horatio Stebbins, Rabbi
Voorsanper and Mrs. Phebe Hearst.
Both prayer and benediction were de
livered by Rev. Robert F. Coyle, pastor of
the First Pr<?Fbyterian Church of Oak
land. President Wheeler made but a
Fhort address, merely introductory to his
presentation of Whitolaw Reid, but the
few words he spoke were full of moment
end profoundly effective. He said:
President Wheeler's Address.
"We are assembled here to-day in rec
ognition of a pious devotion to the cause
that led to the laying of the foundation
of this university, which has grown out
of a harsh conflict with nature â the unl

to the higher consciousness of which we
are members. We live not by bread alone.
Out of the lion's mouth came forth re

history, repeated over and over again,
that as the tension of public spirit has

universities have set themselves along the
path of the commercial empires.

SPEED AND ENDURANCE
ON THE BERKELEY OVAL
A small crowd attended the freshman
sophomore Affiliated Colleges field day on
the Berkeley cinder path yesterday. While
some of the contests were interesting,
none of the events rose to any degree of
brilliancy. No records were broken nor
were any of them equaled. The games
developed a promising sprinter in Stanley
of the clas of '03, who won his heat and
the final in the 100-yard dash. His tlmÂ«Â».
10 4-5, was excellent when It is taken Into
consideration that he has done little or
no training. In all probability the fresh
man will be encouraged, as he has the
making of a fast man in the sprints.
