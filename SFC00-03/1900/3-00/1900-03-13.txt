CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON, March 12.â A formal appeal
to Great Britain for a cessation of
hostilities and restoration of peace
In South Africa has been made by the
Transvaal and Orange Free State through
the intermediation of the United States
In common Â¦with European governments.
It is the impression to-night in official
and diplomatic circles that the British
Government will reply, submitting terms
â¢vth'.ch the Transvaal will be unable to
accept and that the war will continue.
Upon the receipt of Â»Â¦ fllSPflf eh Qor" ,
Consul Hay containing the Boer appeal
It was immediately communicated to Lon
don, and it is expected that the British
Government, which has been expecting
such proposals, will be able to give an Im
mediate answer. The administration has
been stating that it would decline to use
its good offices in the interest of peace
unless asked by both powers to mediate,
but It has changed its attitude to the ex
tent of laying bofore the British Govern
ment the proposals which United States
Consul Hay, as acting British representa
tive, received from Presidents Kruger
and Steyn.
It is understood that Mr. Hay reports
having attended a conference when Presi
dents Kruger and Steyn appealed to all
nations to use their good offices in the in
terest of peace, but it is stated that he
received a special communication relative
to the proposals that should be made, the
Transvaal well understanding the United
States, as the next best friend of England,
would be the best channel through which
to appeal for peace.
Because of the delicate character of the
negotiations in progress and the important
results which hinge upen them the State
Department is indisposed to make public
the contents of the dispatch which it re
ceived yesterday from Consul Hay. nor
will it disclose whether the message,
which was immediately forwarded to the
British Government through the United
Etates embassy in London, was accom
panied by any expression 'on the part of
this Government urging its acceptance. It
Is believed, however, that the administra
tion did not commit Itself, leaving to Great
Britain to determine, without representa
tion on the part of the President, whether
It ehould accept or reject the proposal of
the Transvaal in the interest of peace.
I am informed authoritatively that Pres
ident Kruger and President Steyn are
â¢willing to end the war on this basis:
First â Reorganization of the inde
pendence and sovereignty of the
South African*' republic and Orange
Free State.
Secondâ Naturalization to be con
ferred upon foreigners residing five
years in the Transvaal.
Thirdâ English and Dutch to be
taught in the public schools and to
be used in the courts. .
Fourthâ Arbitration of . claims
growing out of the Jameson raid, of
the coolie question, of the dispute
growing out of the restrictions im
posed by the South African republic
upon the negroes of the entire Trans
vaal and of all other questions at is
eue between the belligerents.
"My informant, who has very good
sources of information, stated that the
first wish of President Kruger was to re
lieve bis country of the suzerainty of
Great Britain. â¢ Â¦ â¢
"It is his desire." he continued, "that
the South African republic ehoulJ be re
moved from European politics, an<l he is
â¢niiling that its position should be the
tame as that of Belgium In Europe."
A diplomatic authority said to-night
that Germany, France and Russia stand
ready to make representations to Great
Britain In the interest of peace Just as
poftn as they are assured the United
States is using its good offices to that
end. -" -~
LONDON. March 13.â Unconditional
surrender on the part of the Transvaal
and Orange Free State and absolute
declination to consider any â¢ proffer of
good offices of intervention on the part
of any foreign power is, according to ex
cellent authority, the policy decided Upon
by the British Government.
Balfour's announcement that the terms
upon which Her Majesty's Government
was willing to end the war would v-ry
shortly be laid before Parliamentâaccord
ing to some reports to-dayâ created the
liveliest Interest among members of all
ebaflej of politics. It quite overshadowed
pects of the war. The Daily News quotes
Whitelaw Reid as saying in a private let
ter:
"I give you hearty congratulations on
the changed aspect of the war. It is an
Immense relief to us all as well as to
you." â¢ ?.
"This view," says the Daily News, "Is
welcome as expressing with . unusual
measure of authority enlightened public
feeling in the United States." .
Except in the case of Germany the re
plies of the powers to the Boer/ appeals
for intervention are not yet known â¢ pub
licly here, but It is quite certain \ that
Austria-Hungary and Italy will dfcline to
interfere, and there 13 no apprehension
that anything will come of the overtures
of the. two. republics.
. A dispatch from Lourenzo Marques an
nounces the arrival there of ;Mr. Fischer,
the' Orange Free State Secretary, and Mr.
Woolmarans, a member of the Transvaal
executive council. It is not known
whether they are bound on a mission to
foreign powers or to Sir Alfred Milner.
Mr. Woolmarans is In President Kruger's
confidence.
Cecil - Rhodes has issued a statement
that his forthcoming visit to England has
solely to do with private business and Is
In no way connected with the South Af
rican settlement.
COLONIES EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE SUPPORT
: LONDON, March 12.â At the commence
ment of the debate in the House of Com
mons to-day on the "army estimates the
Parliamentary Secretary for.^the War
Office, Mr. p Wyndham, declared 'that re
cent events did not. justify. at, the present
time any diminution in< the. provision for
the fuf ther conduct of the campaign in
South Africa. The financial -cost of the
war, he declared," was.not: immediately
altered by fluctuations 'of failure or suc
cess. It would be rash at present to think
that the number of months the British
army would remain in South Africa was
likely to.be materially shortened. ,So the
Government estimates included what was
believed to ; be enough money, to continue
the efforts at full pressure for another six
months and at â¢- half : pressure â¢â¢ for six
months thereafter. â¢ -
" Continuing, Mr. Wyndhamsald he con
templated that, the . colonies would in
future continue their military support of
the empire, on a 'systematic basis, and
they might live to see this new force rev
olutionize the problem* of imperial de
fense. The colonies, he declared, had hot
fulfilled a. contract, but had obeyed the
instinct of the imperial race. It might be
that in the future the colonies would not
only seek to perpetuate their present ac
tion but would seek to render. a repetition
by some organization Â¦oh â¢ prearranged
lines. The' speaker paid a high tribute to
the -heroism of the troops, who, he said,
had so splendidly contributed to the deep
laid strategy of -Lord -Roberts.
-, Regarding shooting practice,. Mr. Wynd
ham said that r the Government proposed
to expend- Â£140,000 on rifle ranges and in
sending officers to ' Switzerland to study
the subject of ranges.
Discussing the necessity for additional
battalions in order to enable the same
number, of battalions to be at home as
were abroad and the impossibility of re
ducing the forces abroad, the Secretary
incidentally remarked: "No one had ever
found the opportunity or time to with
draw our troops from Egypt and no one
ever would find time."
Regarding garrisons abroad, Mr. Wynd
ham said that only by "more voluntary
system of recruiting could the garrisons
be maintained.

"According to good authority President
Kruger and President Steyn have not made

England Not Likely to Agree to Fur-

LONDON,' March 12.â N0 ; communica
tions have passed between London . and
Washington in regard to the Nicaraguan
canal treaty, and the reports cabled here
that Lord ;. Pauncefote, the British Em
bassador at Washington, had sent dis
patches to the Foreign Office bearing on
this subject are Incorrect. The Associ
ated Press is authorized jto say that . the
attitude of the British Government
is that, having agreed to all of
Secretary Hay's requests without ask
ing Â¦Â¦' for -quid pro quo, "*Â¦ it" can do
nothing more, nor express any opinion
untilnew requests are made through the
same channel." As nothing of the kind
had been done, no notice could be taken
of the Senatorial action. â
It appears that Lord Salisbury has thus
far devoted no attention to the matter.
The United States . Charge d' Affaires
here Henry White, had an interview
with * Lord Salisbury to-<lay, but. . as far
as the Associated Press is able t<S ascer
tain" the Nicaraguan canal ; matter was
not discussed. Under the circumstances,
it is 'Â¦ difficult to definitely say what ( will
be the probable attitude of Great Britain
on this question, but the indications point
to the fact that the adoption of the Sen
ate's amendment will result in Great
Britain's | refusal to further consider any
modification of the Clayton-Bulwer
"The Dally News in an editorial dealing
with the Hay- Pauncefote convention says:
. - : "The â¢* Monroe \ doctrine has ' been < made

ment is a peremptory refusal -to entertain
any such terms, and the statement that
there' must be unconditional surrender.
In the Parliamentary lobbies yesterday
the Idea of entertaining any such pro
posals at the present Juncture was alto
gether scouted.
Military experts believe that the end
of the war is still far distant. The result
of the action of Presidents Kruger and
Steyn in appealing for intervention of the
great powers and also to the Governments
of Belgium. Holland and Switzerland, is
awaited with intense interest.
KRUGER APPEALS

TO INTERVENE
THE HAGUE, March 12.â 1t is learned
from reliable source that President Kru

appealed for the intervention of the great
powers in the Transvaal war and has also"
appealed to the Governments of Belgium,
Holland and Switzerland.
DURBAN. Monday, March 12.â The
Transvaal having appealed to Germany
for mediation in the war with Great Brit

clines to interfere, as she is in no way

Lord of the Treasury and Government
leader, replying to a question as to.wheth

could * state the essential conditions on
which alone the Government would entor
tain peace proposals from. the South Af

this connection would shortly be presented
to the House of Commons.
Being asked if there was Â¦any.founda

had addressed a communication Â¦.*o. the
Government. Mr. Balfour -reiterated ' hia

It is learned that the papers promised
by Mr. Balfour will be presented Â¦ to-mor

news cabled by the Associated, Press on
Friday last, that the peace rumors wore
founded on the fact that President Kru

cessation of hostilities, setting forth at
length by cable the terms which! he was
willing to accept, and also. that the cabled
dispatch to the' Premier was signed by
President. Steyn as well as by President
Kruger.
Lord Salisbury's answer is exactly as
given by the Associated Press at the same
time, namely, that the advances had met
with an emphatic rejection at the hands
of Lord Salisbury, who also said that no
such attempt to retain the independence
of the Transvaal could . be considered for
a moment by the British Government.

LONDON, March 13. 4:20 a. m.â Lord
Roberts is making a very rapid advance,
and he is again misleading the Boers ' by
continuing the advance southward g in
stead of through the flat country due
east of Aasvogel Kop. He will probably
seize the railway south of Bloemfontein,
and, although another battle is possible,
it is more likely. that the Boers are only
endeavoring to delay his advance until all
the rolling stock of the railway and the
stores and troops from the Orange River
district can he got away. Such confidence

BLOOD ON THE SLED.
Pinkerton Detective Finds Important
Evidence Against O'Brien.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 13.â A Pinker
ton detective who Is looking up the Clay-
Bon-Relfe-Olson mystery has made some
striking discoveries, according to a story
brought from Skaguay by C. P. Stone. It
seems that the Pinkerton man in going
carefully through the effects of O'Brien,
held at Taglsh under suspicion and now
on his way to Selkirk to be tried on an
other charge, noticed a round mark on
the sled owned by the prisoner. He found
that it was a plug, and when the plug was
pried out he found in the cavity three $100
Canadian bills. , â¢ â¢ " '; â¢ Â¦
-This led to a still closer scrutiny of the
sled, and splashes of blood, afterward as
certained to be human, were discovered.
The plate in the hilt of the prisoner's re
volver was taken off and two $50 bills were
found concealed there. The police think
the numbers on the bills may possibly
connect O'Brien with the mystery and
lead to new developments./, .

CARNEGIE FILES
HIS ANSWER TO
FRICK'S CHARGES
Denies That the Steel Com
pany's Annual Profits
Were Abnormal.
Â«
Former Manager Was Ousted Be
cause He Insisted Upon Dic
tating the Entire Policy
of the Concern.
Â»
PITTSBURO, March 12.â Late this
afternoon the answer of the Carnegie
Steel Company (limited), defendant in
the equity suit of H. C. Frick, to deter
mine the value of his holdings in that
company, was filed In Common Pleas
Cfiurt No. 1. The answers filed are for
the Carnegie Steel Company (limited) and
thirty individual defendants who are
stockholders and directors of the corpo
ration. The document complete makes
nearly 28,000 words, meeting every aver
ment of the plaintiff In the fullest detail.
The answer goes into the manner in
which Frick ac-quired his interest (n the
great corporation, the statement being
made that he, like the other young part
riÂ«-rs. was permitted to purchase his
stock to be paid for out of the future
profits, and that In February, 18y5, he had
no acquired 11 i>er cent of the stock of
the company, for which he owed Andrew
Carnegie $I>TS.I9I.
That being during the period of busi
ness depression, the answer states, Frick
questioned his own ability to carry this
heavy obligation and asked. Carnegie to
take back 5 per cent of his holdings.
This Carnegit- did, paying for the stock
*t the book value, which is the valuation
Frirk now declines to accept for his re
maining holdings, 6 per cent of the com
pany's stock.
Carnegie and the other defendants fur
ther allege that the remaining 6 per cent
of stock, for which Frick now refuses to
accept the book value of $3.<Â»0rt,000, cost
I'rick but $310,000. after deducting the
credits from the earnings of his stock.
Wanted to Hun the Firm.
As to the value of Frlck's services,
Â¦which Frick claims lanrHy added to the
ruccess of the association. Carnegie says
that since January. 18*j5. Frick's functions
have been merely advisory. However,
the defendants <lo not question his abil
ity and say they would be glad to have
him continue in the business had he not
himself forced the trouble and rendered
Fuch lmpofp'.ble. It iÂ« charged that Frick
is a man of imperious temper and at
tempted to make a personal matter of
business differences, giving away to vio
lent outbursts of passion. The defend
ants state that he demanded absolute
power and without it was not satisfied.
It is denied that Carnegie was actuated
by malevolent motives in demanding the
resignation of Frick as chairman, and it
is stated that the resignation was de
manded In order to preserve harmony in
the interest of the association. The
plaintiff was Informed by Carnegie that
he had better resign for his own sake and
to avoid the necessity of a refusal to re
elect him at the approaching annual
meeting. This, however, it is claimed,
was done In the kindliest spirit and after
all the acting members of the board of
managers had signed a paper requesting
Frick to resign.
Touching upon the profits of the concern
and the attempt to orpanize a stock com
pany, the answer stated that Carnegie,
while at luncheon with the plaintiffs and
others connected with the company, by
way of Jest undertook to make estimates
of the profits of the company for the year
IPX), and that the defendant, Andrew Car
negie, under the conditions then existing,
did make an estimate substantially as
averred in the ninth paragraph of plain
tiff's bill ($42,000,000). such estimate, how
ever, being a mere guess at results to be
ascertained fourteen months In the fu
ture.
It is admitted that th*> profits of the
company for the year 1599 were substan
tially as averred by plaintiff ($25,000,000),
but that the amount so stated refers only
to the difference between the amount of
sales and the actual expenses of manufac
ture, and not by any means Indicates the
amount available for distribution ac divi
dends. Â¦ - ' Â¦ â¢ - Â¦. â¢ :
Assets of the Association.
It Is denied that the association has as
sets which it could transfer worth $230,
000,000, and It is asserted that on Decem
ber 11, 1599. the books showed that the net
value of the assets of the association were
$75,610,104. It Is also stated that from time
to time Frick has been a member of com
mittees appointed to revalue the assets of
the company, and it Is stated that the val
uation now repudiated by him is the val
uation which lie has reported and upon
which more than fifteen settlements have
been made with retiring members of the
company or the estates of deceased mem
bers.
Frick. it is claimed, has upheld and en
forced the so-called "Ironclad agreement"
at all times, opposing an attempt on the
part of Henry Phipps to make a change In
the original. During all the years Frick,
as the active agent of the association, ac
quired the Interests of all retiring part
ners under Its provisions; when a part
ner was deemed unsatisfactory by his as
sociates he was informed of that fact by
1- rick, with a statement that the company
would pay for such interests under the
terms of the agreement, and if not ac
cepted voluntarily he would enforce said
terms. This course continued up to the
time of his resignation as chairman and
manaper of the association, and he was
the first to attempt to 'evade the agree
ment.
It is alleged that during the membership
of Frick in the association in addition to
an adequate salary paid him for services
as manager he received upon his Interest
actual dividends in cash, which not only
repaid him the sum of $310,000. which he
himself paid for his interest, but an ad
ditional sum or clear profit of $935,215.
The proposition made by Frick to ar
bitrate the value of his interests is re
jected because the defendants propose at
all times to maintain the integrity of the
contract under which the relations of the
association and its various members have
been defined since ISS7.
THREATENED
WITH DEATH
BY SOLDIERS
False Testimony Demanded
of a "Bull Pen" Inmate
at Wardner. N .
Firing Squad Utilized in Order to
Compel Him to Give Testimony
Against Innocent
Hen.
WASHINGTON, March 12.-L. B. Simp
kins, an electrical engineer at Wardner,
Idaho, testified in the Coeur .d'Alene in
vestigation before the House Committee
on Military Affairs to-day. He said he
did not participate In the riot, but shortly
afterward was arrested by a .squad of
United States troops, who went about the
streets arresting persons pointed out by.
Bunker Hill mine "spotters." Two per
sons who stopped to see the soldiers and
their prisoners were promptly arrested
and put with the other prisoners.
The witness said one of the prisoners, a
Swede, was attacked by a fit, whereupon
a negro struck him. with the butt of a
gun, the blow rendering him unconscious.
The corporal of the guard came up and,
turning the fallen man over, said: â¢ Â¦ .
"I guess you've fixed that fellow all
right."
Slmpkins said one of the prisoners was
robbed of $90. Another or his recitals
caused something of a sensation. He said
he was taken from the "bull pen" by a
squad of four soldiers and marched to an
open enclosure, where he was placed with
his back against a building. The soldiers
stepped back and cocked their guns, ap
parently making ready to shoot him. At
this point, he said,. a high official of the
Bunker Hill mine appeared and said they
had evidence enough to hang the witness
or to send him up for many years, but
that If he would tell who blew up the
mill he would be turned loose. Simpklns
said he protested that he did not know
who the guilty persons were, and the ef
fort to get evidence from him was finally
given up.
Coin for False Testimony.
The witness stated that at another time,
while in the "bull pen," a person, who said
he was authorized officially, offered him
$10,000 to Implicate two persons in the
blowing up of the mill. The party said It
did not matter much who were Implicated,
but the names of certain miners and the
County Assessor were given whom It was
most desired to implicate, for the purpose,
the witness said, of hanging them or get
ting them out of the country. He said he
afterward learned that the Assessor had
had trouble with the Bunker Hill mine
over their assessments. :
The witness detailed an interview with
an army officer In which the latter de
clined to permit a priest to be summoned
to one of the prisoners who was dying,
and also refused- to allow him to com
municate with his partner as to the,, dis
position of his property. He detailed
many other Instances of alleged cruelty.
.One of his recitals was as to a brief
visit by General Merriam to the "bull
pen" and the refusal to allow prisoners
to communicate with him.
In telling of the shooting of Johnson,
the prisoner who went insane, the wit
ness contributed additional testimony,
saying that while Johnson was running
away a certain mine official shouted,
"Shoot! Shoot!" whereupon the soldiers
accordingly shot. The witness said he
helped dig the tunnel intended as a means
of escape, as he was "dying by Inches."
He also gave his experience on the
"standing line" and while in solitary con
finement.
When Representative Sulzer, who di
rected the examination, asked the witness
concerning 'this Siberia of horrors" ob
jections were made to the characteriza
tion, but. on a': vote the committee permit
ted the question. â¢
IMPERIALISTIC
POLICY MEANS
RETROGRESSION
Senator Rawlins of Utah
Opposes Holding of the
Philippines.
Denounces the Expansion Programme
as a Violation of the Funda
mental Principles of This 5
Government.
â â¢
I WASHINGTON, March 12.â During, "al
most the entire spssion of the Senate to
day Rawlins of Utah occupied the floor
in a discussion of the Philippine question.
He went deeply Into the constitutional
phases of the. question. His argument
was largely legal and technical. He is
opposed to the holding of the Philip
pines.
Rawlins said he had read the bill of
Spooner conferring authority upon the
President to govern the islands until Con
gress otherwise provided.
"That bill," said he, "is but the pro
logue of the swelling act in the imperial
theme." ;
I He also read the act of 1803, conferring
upon the President power to govern the
territory " of Louisiana. " Rawlins read
some opinions of Kent and other English
publicists as a basis for his argument.
In response to an inquiry by Spooner,
Rawlins said. In the course of his consti
tutional argument upon the rights of in
habitants of the insular possessions, that
the treaty of Paris conferred upon Con
gress the authority to 'determine the civil
rights and political status of the native
inhabitants of the islands derived from
Spain by the United States, in accordance
with the treaty. It did not, however, he
said, confer that authority .upon . Con
gress with regard to other than native
inhabitants of the islands. He main
tained, therefore, that the constitution
must necessarily extend over the outly
ing territory and that the Americans,
Germans, Frenchmen and others on these
islands could be governed by Congress
only under the limitations of Â¦ the consti
tution.
Waging a War of Aggression.
. Speaking of the Filipinos he said:
These people never acknowledged their alle
giance to this Government; hence they are not
in insurrection asalnst the United States. A
war of aggression Is being waged against them.
The purpose, I believe, in the drafting of the
bill proposed by the Senator (Spooner) Is to
secure recognition by Congress of a state of
war In the Philippines. It comes to us In dis
guise and for the purpose I have stated and to
relieve this administration from its political
anomalous position.
After saying he presumed that the
speeches of Beverldge and Lodge voiced
the sentiments ana presented tfie pro
gramme of the administration, Rawlins
said:
I am opposed to the carrying out of this pro
gramme. No vote of mine will aid to carry-
Ing into, effect the policy outlined by those
Senators. I oppose the programme because it
is in violation of the fundamental principles
upon which our free Institutions are erected;
because It is in opposition to the constitution,
because It proposes to rule by a despotic
power and not by rlghtÃ secured under the con
stitution, because it Is not expansion but retro
gression of all that we have neld highest and
because It Is unjust. Immoral and a breach of
the plighted faith of this nation.
Rawlins declared the Filipinos had been
deceived by the proclamations issusd to
them by the United States and its of
ficials. He continued:
They have been induced to believe that the
great white republic spoke to them with a de
ceptive and forked tongue and it Is to that fact
that may be ascribed the death of many brave
American soldiers and the - waste and blood
shed that have occurred.
While Rawlins was criticizing the ad
ministration for its conduct of the war In
the Philippines he' remarked again that
the Spooner bill was a recognition of hos
tillties-ln the islands.
Spooner Inquired If Rawlins had not
himself expressly consented to a state of
hostilities In the Philippines by voting to
Increase the army, knowing that the sol
diers were to be employed In the Philip
pines.
Rawlins replied that the proposition
that he voted for was one to supply troops
for the relief of those already in the field.
There was nothing in the enactmunt
which could be construed into a declara
tion of war.
"Open Door" an English Triumph.
Later on his remarks, referring to the
open door In China, for which much credit
has been given Secretary Hay, he said it
was purely an English triumph, not a tri
umph for this country. j
What right has a great trust of nations like
Russia, Oreat Britain and Germany to form a
conspiracy and declare to China: "Our behests
you must obey," and then proceed to parcel out
the markets and possibly the territory of
China. J
The open door achievement of the Secretary
of State is on a par with his achievement
known as the Hay- Pauncefote .treaty.
At the conclusion of Rawlins' speech
the Senate passed eighty-six private pen
sion bills and also the following: Approv
ing a revision and adjustment of certain
sales of Indian lands in the States, of Ne
braska and Kansas; to provide for neces
sary repairs to the steamer Thetis for Ber
vice as 'a revenue cutter.

licans voted, with the. Democrats, enough
were absent and unpaired -to reduce the
Republican majority; upon the final/ vote
from 16, the normal majority, to 7.
.Cannon called up the urgent deficiency
appropriation bill, which carried $1,430.5.80.
The principal, items were $500,000 for the
naval estimate and $487,000 for the public
printing office. In connection with the lat
ter Item Richardson called I attention to
the bill he had introduced to regulate the
product of the paper trust. The advance
in the price of paper was one of the causes
of the deficiency appropriation asked for.
Richardson said the creation of the paper
trust had reduced, competition and \n~
creased prices. He said the number of bid
ders for supplying, paper to the _ Govern
ment for the next fiscal year had fallen
from forty-five to fifty, in former years,
to thirty, and the prices had ranged 50 per

ON THE PORTO
RICAN TARIFF
Stormy Conference Held by
Republicans of the
Senate.
Foraker Threatens to Introduce a
'Measure Giving the Island
the Status of a Ter-
â -â¢ â -
WASHINGTON, March 12.â The Senate
chamber and adjoining committee rooms
to-day were the scene of a conflict of
opinion which found no place in the Con
gressional Record, j The basis of the disa
greement was Senator Foraker's bill pro
viding a form of government for Porto
Rico, and only Republican Senators par
ticipated in it. The controversy grew out
of the efforts to have the bill amended.
There are some Senators who hold that
legislation for Porto Rico, for the present
at least, should be confined to providing
for the immediate needs of the inhab
itants of Porto Rico,' and should not in
clude efforts to establish a form of gov
ernment. These Senators generally be
lieve that Porto . Rico should receive no
favors in the way of tariff reduction, and
are content to allow the present tarttf
rates to' continue until, as they put it,
there is more time and the Senate is bet
ter prepared for the dispassionate consid
eration of the question. Their idea is to
leave the island in the hands of the "V\ar
Department.
Senator Foraker, as .chairman of tha
Porto Rican committee, met the proposi
tion of inactivity with a declaration that
if it were persisted in he would not only
drop ihe bill now before the Senate en
tirely, but would introduce as a substi
tute for it a measure providing for the or
ganization of the island as a Territory,
giving it all the officers and all the'privi
leges and immunities of such Territories
as Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizonaâ
not only making the Porto Rlcaa people
full-fledged citizens of the United State*,
but establishing complete free trade be
tween them and the United States proper.
His further purpose, as he outlined it,
was to introduce It as an amendment to
the bill passed by the House and now
pending in the Senate, appropriating the
revenue collected from the island for the
use of .the people.
Foraker Agrees to a Delay.
When the purpose of Foraker became
generally known among the Republican
leaders the Ohio Senator was immediately
besieged by Republicans. While several
of them supported his proposition as a
wise one, many others contended against
it as calculated to commit the country to
a course which might be more easily re
pented of than remedied. They held that
it would be easier in the future to chants
from a present policy of imposing a tariff
to free trade than it would be to change
from free trade to tariff. Fear was felt
by the advocates of a tariff that such an
amendment could be passed with the as
sistance of the Democratic free-traders.
Foraker himself is wedded to the bill un
der consideration, and on account of this
predilection he decided after conferring
with almost every one of the Republicans
to allow matters to drift for a few days.
After the Senate adjourned a number of
Senators held an informal conference in
Senator Allison's rooms, but they de
clared with one accord that no definite
conclusion had been reached as to a line
of policy to be pursued with reference to
Porto Rico.
When word reached the House as to the
possible course of the Senate It caused
much speculation. Dalzoll, Russell, Taw
ney and others of the Ways and Means
Committee said the reported plans in the
Senate were not the result of any confer
ence or consultation with members of the
House; and considerable- doubt was ex
pressed aft to whether the Senate would
make such radical changes as those sug
gested. Â¦â¢â¢.:'.- â¢Â»Â« Â¦-.
Notwithstanding these statements. It
appears that while members of the House
have not been consulted as to any.com
promise, some of them have been ad
vised of the various plans under consider
ation.
Compromise Proposition.
Representative Moody of Massachu
setts, who took an active part in the
House debate, said the proposition up to
yesterday was to combine the House bill,
the 12,000,000 appropriation measure and a
Territorial bill, doing away with the du
ties on goods entering Porto Rico and re
taining the 15 per cent rate on goods en
tering the United States from Porto Rico.
He expressed surprise and some doubt as
to the Senate's abandoning tha tariff
features entirely, although he said there
was no doubt such a change, if made by
the Senate, would be accepted by the
House. Cooper, chairman of the Insular
Committee, and Crumpacker of Indiana
concurred with Moody that the changed
temper of the House would lead to the ac
ceptance of a free trade amendment If the
Senate made it.
Cooper, Crumpacker and Moody were
engaged throughout the day in perfecting
the bill for a Territorial form of govern
ment for Porto Rico, whjch Is to be sub
mitted to the Insular Committee in a few
days. Â¦ '

"TO SEEK FIRST
THE KINGDOM OF GOD"
Rev. Charles M. Sheldon Editing a
Kansas Newspaper "Just as Christ
Would Have Done."
In taking hold of the Topeka Capital and running it for a week as a
daily Christian newspaper the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon Is not making an ex
periment and not exploiting a new and original idea. For fifty-four years
Montreal. Canada, has had a daily newspaper with a circulation of nearly
a quarter of a million, conducted upon exactly the same lines as those laid
down by Dr. Sheldon- This Is the Montreal Witness, founded by John Dou
pall in ISIS. Although in none of the speeches and interviews accredited to
Dr. Sheldon has he mentioned the Montreal Witness, Dr. Sheldon has been
aware of the existence of such a paper for a long time.
Throughout the country Dr. Sheldon's idea has been accepted as original
from the time of the publication of his now famous book. "In His Steps." No
millionaire Christian coming forward to employ Dr. Sheldon to edit a paper.
Â»c availed himself of the courtesy of the opposition. The Topeka Capital de
cided to give Mr. Sheldon a full and unhampered chance to realize his Utopian
ideals. According to the terms of the agreement the entire plant is placed
absolutely at his disposal for one week, commencing March 13. The author
of "In His Steps" assumes entire editorial and business management.
The Capital turns over its presses, types, franchises and advertising con
tracts without reservation. It becomes simply a plant for the publication of
the paper. The experiment will be an unfettered one and in an open field.
And yet the so-called experiment, which Dr. Sheldon will m.ike, has been car
ried on not for one week, but for fifty-four years by one of the most respected
newspapers of Canada.
TOPEKA, Kans.. March 12.â "The
main purpose of the paper will be
to infiuence its readers to seek
first the kingdom of God."
The Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, who
to-day assumed editorial and business con
trol of the Daily Capital, which he will
retain one week, will make this announce
ment in his editorial leader, outlining his
policy to-morrow morning. The Capital,
during this time, will be a "newspaper."
the word "news" being defined by Mr.
Sheldon as anything in the way of cur
rent events that the public ought to
know for its moral and spiritual develop
ment. The paper will be absolutely non
partisan and partisan political news will
be given scant notice. All editorial and
Important local matter will be signed by
the writers. There will be no Sunday
paper, but instead a Saturday evening
paper suitable for Sunday reading.
"May God bless the use of this paper to
the glory of his kingdom on earth." says
Rev. Mr. Sheldon In concluding his
leader.
The first Item on the first page to-mor
row will be a prayer written by Bishop
John A. Vincent of the Methodist Episco
pal church. It Is as follows:
A tnot-nlng prayer and resolution: "I will try
this day to live a simple, sincere, serene life;
repelling every thought of discontent, self
tetklr.g and anxiety, cultivating magnanimity.
eÂ«L-!f-cor.trol and the habit of silence; practic
ing economy, cheerfulness aj-.d helpfulness.
"Ar.d as I cannot in my own strength do this,
or even with a hope of success attempt it, I
look to thee. O Lord, my Father, in Jesus
Christ, my Savlcr. and ask for the gift of the
Koly Spirit."
Editor Sheldon went to the office at S:3O
o'clock th:s morning and will be on .iuiy
until the paper goes to presa at 3 o'clock
to-morrow morning. At 10 o'clock he had
a conference with the correspondents fo:
Eastern papers, and promised to meet
them each evening at 7:3u o'clock and glvw
out certain information concerning his
work. At 11 o'clock he met the local force
of the paper and gave cut the assignments
for the day.
A page will be devoted to local ne*s,
ana the leading features for to-morrcw
will be reports of a temperance revival
and an anti-cigarette meeting. Mr. Shel
don instructed the police reporter that in
case of a murder or other crime he was To
write a bare statement of the facts. It h<?
had the spac* to spare, instead of follow
ing it up with the usual details he would
go into ... discussion of the causes leading
up to the crime.
During the conference the sporting ed
itor remarked that there would be a bowl
ing contest at the Young Men's Chrisran
Association rooms to-night.
â¢"I rtHnk." said Mr. Sheldon, "that that
Is good, clean sport. You may print it."
The dramatic editor asked for instruc
tions about theaters.
"We shall not want anything of that
kind." Mr. Sheldon said.
One page has been reserved for tele
graphic news, which ordinarily fills about
three times that space. The Associated
Press report is necessarily being "blue
penciled" with a vengeance.
The market reports will be cut from
four columns to one. AH quotations en
stocks and bonds, grain options and other
matter involving transactions in futures
have been consigned to the wastebasker.
and only the actual cash prices of grain,
produce, etc.. will be quoted.
A notable feature of the paper will be
the method of handling advertisements. ]
They will be banished from the news and
editorial pages and will be bunched in
places reserved for them. The censorship
here is even more rigorous than in the
news columns, and a large quantity of thi3
claes of matter has already been cut out.
Including all relating to patent medicines.
The familiar corset advertisements of She
magazines, accompanied by cuts, heve
Fought In vain for space. Xo retail adver-
tisements from Kansas City or other out
of-town tradesmen will be accepted, Mr.
Sheldon holding that this would be an In
justice to home merchants. The $20 suit of
clothes for $14 73 style of advertising is
also barred.
The Capital will appear with a radical
change in style and make-up. Practically
the only feature that will be familiar to
its regular readers will be the title head
line The first page, for Instance, or
dinarily devoted exclusively to telegraphic
news, will not have a line of the current
news of the day. Instead the page will
be given up to discussions of what Mr.
Sheldon considers the most important
questions now before the world. There
will be four leading articles on this psge.
the first being devoted to the famine in
India, under these headlines and the fol
lowing introduction:
Starving India. Fifty million people affected
by the famine. Conditions growing worse in
stead of better. The urgent need of aid from
Christian America.
.The Capital knows of no more Important mat
ter of news the world over this morning than
the pitiable condition of famine-stricken India.
We Five the latest available Information of, the
progress of the story in the following article:
Here follow statements from the Rev.
J. E. Abbott of the Bombay Jblission and
Lord Curzbn. Viceroy of India.
'^Militarism" is discussed to the, extent
of about 1200 words, the leading article
under this head being extracts from a
pamphlet on militarism by a Baltimore
physician. Dr. Richard H. Thomas, who
treats the war eagle as a "disease epi
demic in all latitudes." He discusses Its
causes, dangers and cure and urges the
religion of Christ as the only remedy.
The third page story Is a column, and
a half symposium on the Kansas pro
hibitory law and is made up of brief
statements from leading politicians and
educators of the State, all maintaining
that the law has proved a great success.
The fourth and last- important article
is in the form of a letter to Editor Shel
don from the Y. M. C. A. of Colorado ap
pealing to the Christian people of the
country- to establish a home for consump
tives at Denver.
The editorial matter will be switched
from the fourth to the second page. Fol
lowing the title and the usual business
announcements will appear a list of the
employes of the paper from editor down
to galley boy, which will be kept stand-
Ing throughout the week.
The leading editorial will be an out
line of the paper's policy during the week
and Is In part as follows:
The Topeka Caoital this week:
Last December the owners of the Topeka
Daily Capital staked me to assume entire charge
of the paper for one week and edit it as a dis
tinctively Christian daily.
I accepted the Invitation on condition that 1
receive no financial compensation and that a
share of the profits be used for some benevo
lent work and named the week beginning Tues
day. March 13, 1300, as the week for the ex
periment.
With the hearty co-operation of every person
connected with the paper and with the help of
the wisdom that I have prayed might be given
rr.e from Him who le wiser than any of us, I
shall do the best I can.
If a thousand different Christian men who
wished to edit Christian dailies should make
an honest attempt to da so the result might be
a thousand different papers In very many par
ticulars. In other words these Christian ed
itors might arrive at different conclusions In
the interpretation of what is Christian. It is,
cf course, the furthest from my purpose to at
tpmpt to show in a dogmatic way what Is the
one thing that Jesus would do in every case.
The only thing I or any other Christian man
can do in the interpretation of what is Chris
tian in tie conduct of this paper is to define the
term â¢â¢Christian" the best that can be done
after asking for divine wisdom and not Judge
others who might with equal desire and sin
cerity Interpret the probable action of Jesus
In a different manner. * .-. '
With this understanding of the conduct of
the paper this week I will state in part its gen
eral purpose and politics.
It will be a "newspaper." The word "news"
will be defined as anything in the way of dally
events that the public ought to know for its
development and power in a life of righteous
ness. .
Of necessity the editor of this paper or of
every other paper with thla definition of ."news"
will determine not only the kind but the qual
ity of any particular event which ought to be
printed.
The Importance of one kind cf news compared
with another kind will also determine the place
in the paper In which matter will be printed.
If It sterna to the editor that certain subjects
representing great causes that belong, to the
profoundest principle of human life are | the
most important they will be given the first
page of the paper, whether they are telegraphic
items or not. It might easily become the set
tled policy of a prominent paper similar to this
one to consider the detailed account of an un
usual battle as of less Importance to the reader
than an account of the usual daily destruction
being caused by liquor. The first page of the
Capital this week will contain what seem., to
the editor to be the most essential iesues that
affect humanity aÂ« a whole. , '
The paper will be non-partisan not only : In
municipal and State politics, but also in "na
tional politics.
I do rot mean to say that a Christian dally
cannot be partisan. This is eimply my Inter
pretation of Christian aa applied to this part
of the paper's life. ; ;.-.;â¢>-Â¦
On the liquor question the paper will ad
%-ocate the prohibition of the whole liquor busi
ness from Maine to California and all around
the globe. By prohibition I mean the - total
extinction of the curse of making, selling, buy
ing and drinking intoxicating liquor?: its ex
tinction, by legal enactment, by personal â¢ total
abstinence and by every form of State,' home,
church and echool education that Christians
can devise. *''.-'* ..' '
The great social questions of the age will
be given prominence. The eelSshnes* of man
kind In every form of jcreed. commercially or
politically, will be considered as of more seri
ous consequence, to us as a people than any
other "matter* which too often engage the time
and attention of mankind.
The paper will declare ltÂ» abhorrence of war
as It U being: wa*ed to-day : not only In
Africa, but In the Philippines and everywhere
else.
Â¦On mettcr. of "finance" or "â¢tariff" or
pansion." matters - of public Â¦ concern which
have to do -with measure, of this character,*
the editor haÂ« personal opinions which may or
may not be voiced in this paper. ' If he gives
expression to them It will be In no dogmatic
cr positive manner, : a. , If he knew what . the

In regard to many of these questions I don't

Sir Thomas was disinclined to make the

does Captain "Bob" Wringe. The alter

The building in which the fire broke out
was a veritaole firetrap. It was old. of
frame construction and extended two
stories above the ground floor. Until
three or four years ago the structure had
been used as a church, but it was con
verted Into a tenement. The lower floor,
fronting on 50. 52 and 54 Fourteenth ave
nue, was occupied by three stores, and
the upper portion was divided into twenty
living-rooms. As nearly as can be learned
the structure was occupied by ten fam-
lltes, all Italians. Two of the occupants,
Mto Credanza and one other family, kept
boarders, and though the totaX popula
tion of the rookery could not be definitely
ascertained during the excitement attend
ing the tire, there are said to have been
forty or fifty persona of both sexes and
all ages In the building when the fire
started. , Â«
The police are confident that the flrÂ«
was of iDcendlary origin, and they have
arrested Vlto Oredanza on suspicion.
There mas a disorderly card game in onÂ«
of the rooms that lasted until well Into
the morning. Credanza was a participant,
and la said to have made violent threats
against his fellow players. A few min
utes before 5 o'clock every one In tha
buildlrg was awakened by the flames.
They found them burning at the foot of
the stairs leading from the first to tha
second story. The hallway and stairs wera
burning, entirely cutting of? the egress
from the. upper floor, on which six fam
ilies lived. It also cut off the escape by
the doors for those who lived in the rear
part of the first floor. - Those who could
made for the windows. From these they
leaped or dropped.
The whole neighborhood was awakened
in an Instant, and from the burning build
ing came agonizing screams and calls for
help. Â¦ From the basement and ground
floor, the Inmates of the building poured
naked or almost so. From the upper
stories men and women leaped to the side
walk. . By the time the firemen reached
the scene the building was wrapped in
flames, and those who had not escaped
were dead or doomed. They must ha.vÂ«
died within a few minutes, for the flrv
rushed through every room in the frail
building within ten minutes.
The search for the dead began within
twenty minutes after the alarm sounded,
so quickly was the fire conquered.

senting sixty or eighty churches of dif

quest is entirely on moral grounds. They
feel that the closing of the Ingleside race
track one year ago was a blessing to this
city. â¢ That â¢ the year which has passed
since the closing of the track has Wit
nessed good results was manifest to -all.
It Is, therefore, for us to protest against
its reversal. I am personally in favor of
speeding animals if it has for its object
the development of horseflesh and the
consequent improvement of stock. Any
thing of that kind, It seems to us, might
be conducted In a way that would be of
great value to the State. We are not
protesting against the racetrack, but the
poolselling Itself." -Â¦.Â¦Â¦-:

Mayor Phelan then invited Rev. Dr.
Bell to address the board, and- he .â¢ re
sponded- In part he said:
"If we" are to speak concerning the
propositions which have just been read
from the resolution offered by the chair
man of the Police Committee I am slight
ly puzzled as to its meaning. I do not
think it relates to the object of our com
ing before the board. If it be on the sub
ject of the advisability of reopening the
Ingleside racetrack with all that it means
to our city, we are here to protest against
that action, kindly, thoughtfully and
from a moral point of view. I can say,
as the preceding speaker has said, that
4f the element of betting and poolselling
could be prevented by proper legislation
we think that no special protest could be
made. But the proposition to reopen the
track g'eems to carry with it three or four
points which necessarily call for protest
on our part as ministers of the Gospel,
who represent people who believe that
such a move will affect the general, wel
fare of our city. It ie to.be assumed that
the track was to be opened for the pur
pose of making money. It may also be
assumed that' that purpose carries with it
the making of money on a gambling basis.
.That being true, we .would respectfully
and kindly and as citizens protest against
it being reopened. Under the new charter
this city Is making giant strides toward
reform, and we appeal to the members
of the board not to violate their promises
or the objects of the new charter by re
tracing the steps taken by their predeces
sors. We appeal to you as ministers and
we protest against any such action if It
Is contemplated." . â¢;

not reopen Ingleside. I knew that - this

The Board of Health held a conference
â¢with the Chinese Consul General last
evening at 5 o'clock. They asked that the
Consul furnish eighteen men, whose duty
it should be to reduce the garbage of Chi
natown to ashes within the quarter. The
Consul replied that he could not furnish
men for that purpose, and added that the
proper place to dispose of garbage waa at

health officials then declared that they
proposed to permit no garbage to be car

CHARLES W. REED. I went
before

ter. I believe that the acquisition
of public utilities by the city will
be hurt by the passage of such an
ordinance. at= It is antagonistic to
people in this community whose
support at thÂ« last election
brought a victory to the Demo
cratic party and the new charter.
"The sporting element stood by

and helped to save the day for us.
We cannot afford to antagonize

ality and decency have won In " tbelr
II contest with the racetrack gambler*,
and San Francisco's robes will not be

or encouraging vice.
As an issue of to-day Ingieslde la dead.
The present Board of Supervisors went on
record yesterday as being opposed to tho
resurrection of the felon-breeding epot,
and the citizens of the city can feel secure
in their position that for at least two
years they are safe from the contam
inating Influence of the Institution which
In the days of its reign blighted so many
homes, ruined co many lives and made
such & horrifying addition to the popula
tion of our penitentiaries.
Supervisor Joseph Tobin, who has cham
pioned the cause of the racetrack gam
blers, withdrew his ordinance granting
them a new lease of life, and Introduced
an ordinance prohibiting poolselling or
betting of any description within the city
limits, which, if carried Into effect, will
be the most sweeping law ever placed on
the statute books of the city.
Tobin as a Purist.
Joseph Tobin poElnp as a purist is a
pitiable spectacle â lacking sincerity, de
void of honesty of purpose and actuated
by a spirit of revenge, or possibly a desire
to force his colleagues Into submitting to
his plan, the effect of which would
make San Francisco a "wide open
town," a haven for thieves and thugs
and the breeding place of a generation of
criminals and convicts. This man, defeat
ed in his purpose to pive Ing-leside &
monopoly of the racetrack gambling vice.
Introduced an ordinance so sweeping tfcat
it was calculated to be obnoxious. ; He fig
ured that the Supervisors would ' shy at
his Eham morality, and rather than in
dorse his proposed law would submit to
liis plans for reopening Ingleside. Tobin
misjudged the character of his colleagues.
He underestimated the value they ola.ee
upon their honor. His bluff was called
and his ordinance was passed to print by
the following vote:

Ignored His Colleagues/,.'.
The discussion which prefaced the show.
Ing of the Tobin hand developed, the fact
that the friend of Ingleside had not con-
pulted his associates on the Police Com
mittee regarding the ordinance. He was
somewhat embarrassed upon announcing
that he had a minority report to make,
when Supervisors Reed and Helms, nis
colleagues, stated they were not prepared
to make any report whatever, for the rea
son that Tobin had elected himself the
"whole thing" on racetrack and poolroom
affairs.
Reed's Admissions.
Supervisor Reed opposed Tobin's ordin
ance and in doing so exposed a state se
cret that made even Mayor Phelan bush.
He argued that it would not do for the
party In power to antagonize the- gam
bling element, for, he asserted, it had been
a valuable ally for Phelanism and the
Democratic party at the last city election,
and had virtually saved the day for the
"little Mayor." Phelan attempted to &top
Reed in his wild harangue, but the Super
visor was disposed to tell the whole truth
and there was no power strong enotign
to shut him off. " ...
In marked contrast to the admissions of
Mr. Reed was the bold and manly stand
taken by Supervisor Comte. He said that
it was in keeping with the reform prom
ised by the new charter to crush out every
form of vice that threatened the youth of
the city, and that when he felt that he
had to "truckle to gamblers to secure his
political success he would retire from pub
lic office. , .
Ministers Condemn Ingleside. ;
After a great deal of preliminary spar
ring between Supervisor Tobin. Super
visor Reed and the Mayor, it was de
cided to listen to the reading of the ordi
nance proposed by Tobin. After the read
ing, a number of ministers present were
allowed to address the board. Rev. E. A.
Woods, pastor of the First Baptist
Church, spoke in part as follows:
"Petitions and resolutions have been rs-

San Francisco, where, by the advice or
prominent members of the Iroquols Cluo,
he filed the entry in the San Francisco

Mr. Hollywood about four months ago
was called upon to enter another coal

CHARLES W. REED,
A. COMTE JR.praise In this suggestion, and it !s not
unlikely â¢ that if it be adopted by toma
competitor for the prize his Honor will
convene the judges of tha contest In'se
cret session and commune with them as
he has so kindly done with other com
missions. It would not be unwise for tha
judges to demand an understanding on
' this point; as his Honor, as is well-known.
Is a stickler for plans and specifications
in these things. ,*...- *
# And although he has a very keen knowl
edge of what a stuffed jury Is, he knows
also that the stuffing is likely to - slip
away.- He is likely, therefore, to remove
one of the judges at the last moment for
the public good, and when such humilia
tion can .be avoided the judges should
seize the first opportunity Is an under
standing.
The suggestion of G. A. Bronstrup will
probably also meet with commendation.
It Is faithful to the regal idea, although
Mr. Bronstrup ' has failed to suggest tha
now famous dinners, at one of which iir.
Phelan tilted full at certain towers as
another beclouded knight did at the wind- *
mills. In the proposed Bronstrup flag.
however, his Honor the Mayor is given,
full credit of his "hefting" victory.
Mr. Phelan might issue a supplemental -
- list of contest conditions and impress
upon competitors the dignity of the ban
quet incident. No event in his HonorTs
career won him perhaps so much distinc
tion. The affair possibly will live greener
in his memory perhaps than any other.
' Gordon Ross Is firmly convinced that
fÂ«ll justice cannot be done to the subject
unless-an elaborate color scheme is used.
. He believes, as do the others,
that Mr. Phelan symbolizes San
Francisco, and that Mr. Phelan can
receive ' a pictured reality only On
- a long green background. Without
such a supporting. background Mr. Ross
says that the central feature of the en
tire flag would lose Individuality, become
insipid and fade away. But that U an
opinion to which Mr. Ross is probably en
titled. It Is one of many offered in sug
gestions, and this morning The Call pre
sents them with a hope that they may be
valuable to the competitors for the prize,
to the Judges and to Mr. Phelan. and that
to the ptfblic they are not uninteresting.

SOME THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY J\ FLAG FOR THE CITY,
the Mayor chose deliberately, and with
that keen sense of responsibility which
guides him in the making and unmaking
of Police Commissioners, in the disposal
of public benefits and in the determination
of what shall be for the public good. The
first Judge chosen by his Honor the
Mayor was Colonel Mendell, one of the
Commissioners of Public Works. What
the colonel doesn't know about flags is
not worth knowing. Or perhaps the
Mayor, stunned by the disasters of his
recent combats with public opinion, wants
a battle flax that means success. For
that reason, probably. Colonel Victor-
Duboce was also made a Judge of the
great flag contest and Supervisor Hotal
lng was added possibly to subdue the
fiery tastes of the others. Park Commis
sioner Stanton's well-known position as
art critic in chief to the Mayor assured
him the fourth place.
With such formidable judges the con
testants for the Mayor's coin have good
reason to be apprehensive. They have
cause to think well before they submit
their conception of what the city's flae
should be. In order to assist these pen
tlemen, and perhaps Interest and advls?
the Mayor and his Judges, The Call hn.;
determined to give this morning a few
EUg*estions. The artists of The Call have
combined to help along the worthy cause
by presenting pictorially their views c>
the great subject which so agitates hi.<
Honor's mind.
Without exception these artists have
worked from the same point of view. They
have been inspired by the same central,
overshadowing thought. They form thea
a concensus of public and artistic opiulcr.
which is worthy of consideration. It
fchould not be overlooked by the judges,
who undoubtedly are busy men and ac
cept suggestions as a welcome relief.
Colonel Mendell possibly Is more interested
at present in a municipal sewer system
than in selecting a banner to adorn the
canopy of the Mayor's chair of state. Mr.
?tanton. rumor has it, is puzzling hit
brain over decorated park grass plats
more than over a city emblem/ Super
visors Duboce and Hotaling have been
trying bow to prevent the fastening of an
insolvent debtor's lock on the door of the
treasury rather than contemplating the
glory of raising a flag over the dote- of
the City HalL
And U the Judges flnd^i the designs buljt
mltted by competitors some of the Ideas
of The Call artists due weight will bÂ«
given. It is a matter of general Interest
that the one central thought which in
spired these artists was his Honor the
Mayor. This gentle compliment will prob
ably be appreciated by him in the spirit
In which it was given. All of these artists,
as students of current events, know the
value of perpetuating in some artistic
way the story of incidents which have
made their impression upon the public
mind. They know the historical worth of
emblems that tell the tale of many great
men and some small ones, and in design
ing for San Francisco an emblem that
will at a glance tell the story of the "new
era of reform and progress" in this city
they have without exception turned to
Mayor Phelan. .They have all pictured
his Honor as he Is and not as he ought to
be, although one contributor to the collec
tion has outlined bis Honor as his Honor
thinks he Is.
Harry E. Warren has carried his
thought of symbolization to the point of
perfect success. In his thought new
San Francisco is Mayor Phelan and Mayor
Phelan is his hatâ that famous tile which
revolutionized the city government. The
artist believes that San Francisco can
have no better flag than a small white one
with a silk hat in the very center. With
a liberty which generally characterizes
his work and method, Mr. Warren has
given free rein to his imagination; he
has trifled with the ancient heraldic signs
and symbols, has taken from them an in
spiration for a modern escutcheon and has
In the offering of "William J. Kelly a very
valuable suggestion. Â¦ Mr. Kelly is con
vinced that future San Francisco will ben
efit more by having constantly before her
eyes the Incidents that marked the birth
of the "new" life than by fretting herself
with a never-ending vision of something
severely antjque and classic. Inspired by
that idea Mr. Kelly believes that it la no
dream. He has enthroned and crowned
his Honor the Mayor and placed at his
side that familiar fan-bearer who sought
to wield stars, not fans. Before the local
monarch, set upon a glistening pile of
gold bricks, with that trademark that no
longer deceives the public, is an urn. from
which Issues the Incense of the Mayor's
ambitionâ his Senatorial aspiration.
With an exuberance of klndnes3 Mr.
Kelly has also made delicate reference
to the dead hopes of his Honor. It la
such references as these which will give
historical value to a flag of San Fran
cisco.
Charles IL Owens believes that the tri
color should not be abandoned even in
a municipal flag, but he Is convinced that
no three colors in existence are bright
enough unadorned to picture the era
which Mayor PhHan has Inaugurated.
To show more clearly the development of
"New San Francisco." Mr. Owens has
given a new arrangement of colors â
white, red and blue â typifying, no doubt,
the three stages of mental feeling in the
city as the change was accomplished.
Each color serves as a background for a
panel and each panel Is the pictured
story of local history.

The Call Offers Some Sugges
tions to the Competitors in
the Great Phelan Contest,
And Gives Some Advice to the Worthy
Judges Who Will Make History in Their
Choice ol San Francisco's Banner.
ON* February 20 Mayor James D.
Phelan offered a prize of $50 for
the best suggestion of a flag for
the city. His Honor chose an op
portunity particularly well fitted to excite
the emulation of the people who see in
him their chief executive, as he had just
wen joO in an essay contest. By setting
the money up again as a bait he showed
that while he is not deaf to the call of
competition he is above the cheap rewards
of success. And anyway the Mayor has
been convinced for a long time that the
city needs a flag. He has even so digni
fied the necessity of a municipal owner
ship of an emblem that he has referred to
the matter in his annual message.
So great a need called for a remedy and
the Mayor offered the $50 as a reward,
with a reminder, gently made, of his
cleverness as well as suggestion in
competition. No limit was placed upon
the contest except as to time, next Thurs
day being fixed as the last day upon
which sample flaps would be received.
And in the matter of merit the Mayor
was very critical. He chose the judges
of the contest with that care which at
taches to the consideration of great
events. The selection of a municipal flag
is a serious matter, for the banner will
signify the city to other cities. It is as
the nation's flag to the banners of other
nations.

the chief executive and why should not
the ensign of the Mayor be as gorgeous
as that of a President or an admiral? So

the charm of art and the force of truth.
Few people In San Francisco ever realized
bo keenly before perhaps how much his
Honor the Mayor holds in his hat.

Mayor Phelan as he sees himself and as

Mayor towers above the peninsula, his
face glowing in the light of self-esteem
and his back plastered by the mire of acts
which do not call forth an expression oÂ£

Mr. Cahill is evidently not impressed
with the Mayor's choice of judges who are
to sit In judgment upon the design of
flags submitted. When his Honor selected
the judges he chose neither a saintly man
nor a practical politician, and both would
be absolutely necessary to pass critically
upon Mr. Cahill's suggestion. But It Is
offered for what it is worth. Perhaps Mr.
Phelan. recogniztng as he did in the

THE VOICE OF GORMAN.
WHEN Gorman defeated Bryan's desire to have
the Democratic national convention meet
early in June, and succeeded in having it post
poned to July 4, he gave evidence of his power in
Democratic councils and proved himself to be ; a
leader whom the Bryanites will have to reckon with
and treat with respect. By baffling the scheme to
call the convention prior to the date fixed for the
Republican convention he gained another > month of
time in which to organize the opposition to the
Nebraska man.
That accomplishment, however, is not the only evi
dence given of Gorman's activity and leadership in
the higher councils of the party, however lacking he
may be in influence among the rank and file. The
call issued by the Democratic National Committee for
the election of delegates to the convention sounds
more like the voice of Gorman than of Bryan, and
is an astute appeal, not to free silverites and radicals,
but to the conservative elements of the country.
The appeal says: "All Democratic conservative re
form citizens of the United States, irrespective of past
political associations and differences, who can unite
with us in the effort for pure, economical and con
stitutional government, and who favor the republic
and oppose the empire, are cordially invited to join
us in sending delegates to the convention."
In that address there is much of false pretense, but
there is also much adroitness. It is a foregone con
clusion that Bryan's nomination will mean another
disturbing agitation affecting the financial security of
the nation and of all who have money in the banks,
and that no conservative course on any great issue
will be a part of the policy of his platform. The ap
peal, therefore,- to conservative, supporters of eco
nomical and constitutional government to take part
in electing delegates to the convention can mean
in honesty nothing more than the defeat of Bryan!
If it do not mean that, then it is but a false pretense
and a snare. , Â¦â¢',
Gorman* is 'sufficiently sagacious to perceive that
the silver movement is. dead, and that another fight
for free silver will come very near meaning death. to
Democracy itself.' He sees in the prevailing oppo-

PETITIONS TO CONGRESS.
BY the Washington correspondent of the New
York Sun an interesting account is given of
the quantity and quality of petitions . sent to
Congress, and the manner of their treatment when
thej r arrive there. In these days when every yellow
journal in the land makes a feature of getting up
"mammoth petitions" on all sorts, of subjects, and
then cites them as proofs of its potent influence in
shaping legislation, it will be worth while for the
public to give some passing attention to" "what the
Sun correspondent has to say.
There was a time, of course, when Congress gave
respectful consideration to every petition presented,
but that was in the days when petitions were compara
tively rare, and when it wat not easy to get a bill
providing for some desired legislation introduced
into Congress. In these days, however, Congress
permits the introduction of any and every sort of bill
and authorizes its publication as an official docu
ment, and as a consequence petitions asking for con
sideration of this or that measure are no longer re
garded as of any particular value.
Describing the history of the average petition, the
writer says: "It has its birth- in some reform cru
sade. It is circulated and its growth tenderly nur
tured. Some morning it turns up in the mail of a
member of Congress in Washington. If he followed
his natural impulse it would go to the wastebasket.
Instead it is turned over to the tender mercies of a
clerk. That is generally the last the Congressman
ever sees of it. The clerk hurriedly indorses on the
back, 'Petition of Richard Roe and others, asking
for the passage of a bill,' etc. Congress never hears
of it. It is taken by the clerk to the document room
and joins a hundred or more others on all conceivable
subjects. Here another clerk prepares a brief notice
of it for insertion in the Congressional Record, and
the petition is sent to the committee having charge
of legislation on the special subject mentioned, pre
sumably to be considered solemnly by the committee
and at the end of the session to be stored among the
Government records. From then on the petition is in
constant jeopardy. There is not one chance in a
thousand that it will ever be opened. Observant
persons have noted that an amazingly small propor
tion of the vast number of such documents referred to
the various committees are ever heard of more. Even
after petitions come from committee and reach the
records rooms they have been known to disappear in
some mysterious manner. Nobody seems to know
how, and, as a matter of fact, nobody cares."
Despite the carelessness with which they are-han
dled and the indifference of Congressmen to them,
the petitions stored away in the Capitol amount to
an enormous number. They are piled in the vaults
of the basement, in the attic and in document rooms
on both the Senate and the House side of the build
ing. "The records of some of the great "freak peti
tions" of the yellow journals are curious. Thus it is
noted there was one day presented a monster peti
tion purporting to contain 4,000,000 names request
ing intervention on behalf of Cuba. . "The petition
was mounted in a great reel and was resplendent
with American and Cuban flags. : For several days it
stood in an adjacent room and was viewed by
thousands. Finally some inquisitive clerks took upon
themselves the task of counting the names. When
the petition was unrolled the entire center was found
to be a blank. Instead of millions of names the pe
tition contained, by actual count, but 11,000, and the
most of these were evidently written by half a dozen
persons."
Congressmen who desire to know the will and wish
of their constituents do not wait, for these yellow
freaks to be presented to them. Of course requests
from persons known to the Representative or from
accredited and responsible organizations are given
attention, but the mighty mass of such documents are
of no effect on legislation whatever. In fact,- it is
probable that most of the yellow petitions are as
thorough fakes as the one the inquisitive clerks ex
amined, and were the fading and decaying mass
thoroughly overhauled there would be doubtless
found whole stacks of Examiner-Journals rolled, up
inside of petitions, partly by way of stuffing, and
partly to avoid the necessity of sending too many
to the garbage crematory*.

MARY DID HER BEST.
The public schools of a certain New
England city have recently taken to an ex
acting form of art. The pupils are placed
before a model and told to sketch as they
see.
One day a little girl was seated In a
chair on the platform and her classmates
were given the usual .order.
The results varied. Some of the draw
ings looked like a human being in a state
of repose, others like wooden dolls. But
one little girl had drawn the chair and a
tiny figure standing in front of it.
"Mary," said the discouraged teacher,
"didn't I say, 'Draw Amelia as you see
her?'" â¢
"Yes'm."
"Well, is. she standing in front, of the
chair?"
"No'm. She's sitting 1 In it.
"Then why didn't you draw her Bit
ting?" Â¦
Team came into the child's eyes. She
was misunderstood.
"But I hadn't got to It," she said. "I
was just going to bend her down when
you rang the bell."â Youths' Companion.
"Still," said the old friend, who had
called to converse with the venerable
sage, "in your advancing age It must be
a great comfort to know your fame Is se-
cure."
"Yes," replied the aged scientist; "1 am
told there is a new disease and a 5-eent

EXPANSION AND CLIMATE.
KNOWLEDGE is gaining in regard to the phy
sical conditions of our new tropical posses
sions. It is decided by the medical authorities
of our navy that two years is the extreme limit of
naval service in the Philippines. Those authorities
report that after the first year in that climate its en
ervating effects multiply so rapidly that a three years'
assignment is dangerous. A warship is not an un
wholesome place. Indeed it is as sanitary as a hos
pital. Distilled water is used; artificial ice is manu
factured; the food is the best in quality and prepara
tion; the men are kept from contact with the steam
ing tropical soil, and yet with all these advantages
over land service official medical experts decide that
a longer service than two years is fatal.
There are indications that the medical service of the
army is noting the need of a still briefer service on
land. Already the order is out to return a â¢ large
number of the militar}' commands sent out last suin
irer, and their places arc to be taken by fresh troops,
now being recruited in the East.
We are glad that at last there is this official admis
sion of The Call's contention that a tropical climate is
poison to races of the temperate zone. It will aid in
rescuing our people from the consequences of their
very general self-deception. A year ago, when we
were calling attention to the physiography of the
tropics, others were inviting the "American home
seeker" to migrate to the Philippines, Cuba and
Porto Rico and grow up with a country already o'ver
populated by tropical races and under a vertical sun
that is as fatal to white men as a lethal dose of mor
phine. Our ultimate policy for disposing of our re
sponsibility in the tropics will be largely guided by
the growing knowledge on this subject.
Concurrently with this official recognition of the
physical depravity wrought by the climate, affirming
the rapid degeneration of the constitution of white
men, there is news of the renewal of warlike activity
r>mong the Filipinos and the assurance of an army
officer that at the present rate of progress their re
sistance will rot be subdued for ten years, during all
of which time our military force there must be main
tained at its preÂ«ent figure, of about 70,000 men. The
long struggle will repeat the history of the Acheen
war, which Holland has maintained for thirty years,
at such cost that it has eaten up more than all the
revenue derived from her tropical possessions in the
East. We may look for the same result as to rev
enue, and for still more serious physical results, be
cause we are not as well disciplined in guarding
r.gainst the dcndly effects of a tropical climate.
Official medical authorities are especially concerned
!>y the very large number of cases of insanity among
our soldiers in the Philippines. Lunacy is almost
epidemic in the ranks and is supposed to be the effec\
of the intense vertical sun. A great many suicides
have been caused by it. even among officers.
HIGH SCHOOL PRIVILEGES
DEMANDED BY THE NORTH END
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have aa communications of general interest.
Editor The Call: I am indebted to. my
old friend Joseph Catania and his sons ot
the California market for the Information
that in all the public Bchools of this city
north of Sutter street, from the bay to
the ocean, there is not a single high school
or commercial class. Why this discrim
ination against this important and popu
loub part of the ci^y? Don't the people
of the north end and north central sections
of the city pay their school taxes? "Mo
thinks" they rather do. I will ever honor
the pioneers who first settled around the
old historic plaza (Portsmouth square* of
Yerba Buena and made this city what it
is to-day. They paid the taxes and spent
their money to make the south end. the
Mission and the Western Addition. Shall
their children now be deprived of equal
educational facilities with the children of
the rest of the city? It is a gross injus
tice and deserves the severest censure
and condemnation of the School Board.
Of course, with our little peanut Mayor
from the Panhandle, and his pigeon
brained and narrow- minded School Board
from the Mission, the north end and north
central sections (the most important part
of the city) must be deprived of its lust
and rightful opportunities for the chil
dren's education. There was a high school
and commercial class at the Washington
Grammar School, corner Washington and
Mason streets, but they have been abol
ished by the small-minded persons who
unfortunately misgovern the public
schools of this city. The people of the
north end and north central section should
rise en masse and demand their just
rights, to which they are equally entitled
with the rest of the city. You will earn
the thanks and lasting gratitude of the
parents of the sections named by alvo
cating and insisting upon the establish
ment of a high school and commercial
classes in the public schools therein.
Yours very respectful^

DANGER AHEAD
FROM THE SALE
OF FIREWORKS
Fire Marshal Towe Sounds
a Note of Warning to
Citizens.
The Charter Conflicts With the State
Law in Not Bequiring Vendors
to Pay a Ucense
Fee.
Fire Marshal Towe scents great danger
to the city on the next Fourth ol July
celebration through a conflict between
the charter and the State law as to the
sale of fireworks. Under the State law
no person may offer fireworks for sale
without first obtaining a permit from the
Fire Marshal and paying a license fee of
$10 to the license collector. This kept the
sale within reasonable limits and enabled
the Fire Marshal to keep watch over
dealers. As a result flres decreased from
between forty and sixty on the Fourth to
from five to ten, and the loss entailed was
in proportion. . '
The dealers, chiefly Chinese, begin prep
arations for the event early each year,
and this year the Fire Marshal has issued
four retail permits and one wholesale per
mit for the sale of fireworks, the retailers
paying each the $10 license and the whole
saler a $50 license. Now he has discovered
that the charter does away with the
license fee and he has refused to issue
any more permits till he consults his at
torney. He has also advised Chief Sulli
van of the Fire Department or the dan
ger and the Chief will lay the matter be
fore the Mayor.
There is a clause in the charter giving
the Board of Superiors power "to im
pose license taxes and to provide for ths
collection thereof, but â¢no license taxes
shall be imposed upon any person who at
any fixed place of business in the city ana
county sells or manufactures goods, wares
or merchandise except such as require
permits from the Board of Police Commis
sioners, as provided in . this charter. "
Therefore no license fee is necessary for
any one selling fireworks, and as it was
the only deterrent every small store
keeper will be wanting to sell them, and
if the Fire Marshal can be compelled to
Issue permits to every one who makes
application the danger is only too appa
rent.
Since the thing which the Board of Health calls
"bubonic plague" took over twenty days to kill a
Chinaman afflicted with other diseases, and eighty
two hours to kill a neglected guinea-pfg, it is evi
dently a slow poison in this climate and not at all like
the terror of the Orient
it from Bryanism, and has determined to. profit by
the chance so far as he can. It matters little to him
that imperialism is advocated .by some of . the most
conspicuous leaders of Democracy in Congress and
in the country. He is just now seeking for votes,
and in doing so has spread this appeal to mugwumps
as a fisherman would spread a net to catch gudgeons.
ANOTHER KENTUCKY CRISIS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 1900.
WHILE we are boasting of our equipment for
judgment of the capacity -of other people for
self-government we are furnishing the world
an object lesson in our own incapacity therefor by
the .assembling of. two armies in Kentucky to prob
ably battle over the State government.
the Call long ago pointed out the working and
probable results of the Goebel law. It is an elab
orate statutory mechanism for falsifying the results
of an election, and suppression of the will of the ma
jority. That it was used to deprive Taylor and the
Republican State officers of the places to which they
had been elected was made evident when the State
Returning Board, by Democratic votes, declared Tay
lor and his colleagues to be elected. To overthrow
this decision in the Legislature Republicans were
ousted from their seats, to be replaced by Democrats,
and then a strictly partisan committee was appointed
which reversed the finding of the Democratic Return
ing Board. Before the report of this committee was
made to the Legislature Governor Taylor, who hid
been regularly inaugurated, adjourned the Legisla
ture, having the legal right so to do. Then followed
the assassination of Goebel, the administration of the
oath to him on his deathbed, and the pretended suc
cession of Beckham, who ran and was defeated with
him on the ticket for Lieutenant Governor.
The State now has two governments. Taylor is in
possession of the State House, the great seal and
other muniments of authority. He is in command of
one section of the State militia, and Beckham is or
ganizing another. Both sides are abundantly sup
plied with arms, ammunition and determination.
There is a clash of military authority which may re
sult in fighting for the State armories. The situation
is further confused by the offer of a reward of $100,
000 for the assassin of Goebel. That large sum has
stimulated detective ingenuity, and several Republican
State officers are under arrest for that crime. So
large a sum will make perjury easy and pay for the
manufacture of a case against innocent men, so that
those under arrest feel uncertain about their ability to
secure a fair trial.
The disorder has therefore penetrated every branch
of the government. It has extended like a plague
from the ballot-box to the bench. Potent passion
pervades the legislative, executive and judicial
branches of the government, and free institutions art
being made a mockery and a byword.
In the disturbed conditions following the Civil War
strife of this kind was common in Louisiana, Arkan
sas, Mississippi and South Carolina. But it was then
excused as a necessary part of the vast chaos and
demoralization caused by war. Now, however, there
is no room nor reason for such excuse. Kentucky,
like the rest of the country, was at profound peace
when last year's Democratic State convention met.
All that has happened since began in that convention.
Goebel was a man of vaulting ambition and violent
and unscrupulous nature. Blood was already on his
hands, and he was understood in his own party to be
capable of any act that might be necessary to win his
way, regardless of legal or moral obstructions. His
nomination was compassed by the violent expulsion
of a large number of regular delegates and the cor
ruption of others; the prolonged session of the con
vention was characterized by such shameful features
that the manhood and State pride of the better Dem
ocracy revolted. Another convention was held and
a competing ticket was put in the field, headed by
John Young Brown! These two Democratic fac
tions almost brought the State into civil war during
the campaign. Even Colonel Bryan was warned that
he was in danger of being shot by the members of
one faction if he went into the State to speak for the
ticket of the other.
The Republicans conducted their campaign in an
orderly manner and won. It is estimated that their
actual majority was 40.000. but this was cut down by
the legalized rascality of the Goebel judges of elec
tion, until there remained an apparent majority of
only 3000. In a' well-ordered, self-governing com
munity that majority should be as sacred and in
violable as one of tens of thousands. But the spirit
of Goebel survives him, and his partisans are deter
mined to grasp power by any violation of law or any
misapplication of its principles which may suit them.
There is no doubt that the righteous cause of Gov
ernor Taylor suffers from the murder of Goebel,
though no proof can be found connecting him in any
way with that crime. This feeling, however, should
not obscure the issue, which is one of law, order and
justice, in which there is no doubt Governor Taylor
has been in the right from the beginning.

FLY-CASTING RECORDS.
A Successful Day of Contests at Stow
Lake.
That fly-casting is growing In popular
ity is evidenced by the large turn-out of
members at Sunday's contest at Btow
Lake. No less than twenty-three enthu
siasts competed In the various events,
and there were eight or ten other mem
bers of the club present at various times
during the day who were unable to. com
pete The weather conditions were even
more favorable than on Saturday, and the
scores considerably higher in every event
except distance. Perhaps the large crowd
of Interested spectators added something
to the ginger that was thrown into the
work throughout the entire meeting, but
whatever it may have been, Â¦ the results
were apparently satisfactory to the con
testants and were evidently so to the on
lookers.
One of Chicago's crack lure-casting ex
perts was present and cast as a guest of
the club, but did not equal the.score of
Mansfield, who was high man in the last
three events, duplicating his performance
of Saturday. In long distance Golcher
headed the list with 114 feet. Daverko
sen was next with 103 feet, while Muller
and Brotherton were a tie for third, with
95 feet each.' Â¦ Â¦ .
In accuracy Mansfield was 9o per cent
and Everett and Young 93 per cent each.
In delicacy Mansfield led with 90 5-12 per
cent, with Muller second, with 86 2-12 per
cent. Mansfield was also high in : lure
casting, with 89 1-5 per cent, although he
had a close Becond ln Bluhm, the Eastern
expert, with a score of 88 2-5 per, cent. â¢

11. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
The idea of sending messages from one
point to another without the use of con
necting wires has always been fascinat
ing since the first practical telegraph. It
can be accomplished in a variety of ways,
but all methods fall naturally Into two
classes. The first Includes all those
methods in which the transmission of the
signal is effected by "leakage" of electric
current from the transmitting apparatus
to the .receiving end through the earth
or the water. The second class embraces
all methods ln which the transmission is
by waves traveling through the remark
able "ether" which is conceived to fill all
space. Just as those waves travel which
produce the sensation of light.

raphy yet which Is absolutely "wireless."
Wireless telegraphy, as now understood,
however, employs no line wires, such as
are necessary ln ordinary telegraphy to
connect the transmitter and the receiver.
Transmission through the earth or
water without wires has been accom
plished many times. The earth is full of
wandering currents which need only a
sensitive detector like the â¢ telephone to
become evident. Indeed, the difficulty Is
to prevent any currents which have ac
cess to earth from wandering and to keep
them in the paths marked oat for them.
Without enumerating the attempts
which have been made in this direction
during the last half century or more, a
single example will be sufficient to make
the matter clear. Some years ago Trow
brldge found that the time signals from a
clock in the observatory in Cambridge
could be distinguished four miles from the
line conveying the signals to Boston. A
telephone receiver was used as a detector
in a line about fifty feet long, the ends
of -the line being grounded by means of
rods , which were stuck Into the earth.
The current had spread out to this extent
between the earth plates in Cambridge
and Boston, assisted, probably, by the
water mains and the water in the soil.
The Leakage Method.
On this principle it was proposed that
ships at sea should communicate, a strong
current from a dynamo being sent Into
the sea' through a trailing wire and the
current detected by a telephone connected
to a similar wire trailing from . another
ship. It was even suggested that commu
nication could be established across the
Atlantic by -' sending :; a strong Â¦ current
through a wire running the length of- the
American continent and connecting the
ends of the line to the ocean. A telephone
line running from England to Liberia
would pick â¢up enough current to maks
the signals distinguishable.
. To understand the operation of the sec
ond method It will be best to consider the
action of waves of a similar character.
"When a wave progresses over the Â«nr
face of water it Is not by the onward mo
tion of the water Itself. Each particle ot
water oscillates up and down, communi
cating Its motion to the next, and In this
way causing the wave form to travel on
ward until It breaks upon the shore or is
smothered out by the friction in the water
itself.. In just this way a wave passes
over a field of standing grain. Each stalk
keeps its place, but the wave form moves
onward. A wave may be made to travel
a rope or a long spiral spring; in fact, ln
any substance which for any reason tends
to resume its original shape or volume,
A sound-producing wave in air Is of much
the same character, although the motion
of the air particles Is to and fro along
the direction of motion of the wave, in
stead of across It; for air has elasticity
of volume, but not of shape. These air
waves are ordinarily invisible, but pro
duce the effect of sound within certain
limits of rapidity, if the receiver Is an or
gan* of hearing.
A single sharp disturbance of the air.
like an explosion, starts an air wave
which travels outward ln all directions
from the source; or a regular repetition
of Impulses, like the sound of a siren whis
tle or of a bell, causes a series of waves.
These disturbances are transformed by
the ear upon which the wave strikes Into
the sensation of tnÂ© report of the explo
sion or the musical note of the bell, re
duced to loudness ln accordance with the
distance. For the wave Is spreading out
into greater and greater spheres and the
proportion of the whole wave which is re
ceived is correspondingly reduced as it
recedes from the starting point.
If, Instead of falling upon an ear which
responds to a wide range of vibrations
the waves are received by some appar
atus which responds to but one definite
pitch or rapidity of vibration, little or no
effect Is produced unless the waves are
of the same pitch as that of the receiving
Instrument- Such an Instrument Is called
a "resonator" and the action is known as
sympathetic, resonating or syntomic ac
tion. The resonator selects only the
waves of Its natural period.
To account for the known phenomenon
of light It has been found necessary to
assume the existence of an all-pervading
substance called the "ether." Nobody
can see or feel the ether, but there are
few. If any. now who doubt its existence.
It must be endowed with y very remark
able properties; a rigidity great enough
to transmit waves with a velocity of
156.000 nitlfj a second: a lightness so in
conceivable that all forms of matter pass
through It with little or no resistance;
filling all space, even that between the
molecules of every body. In the ether
are passing at all times and always with
this immense speed of ISS.WO miles a
second waves of all frequencies and of
all lengths. The light-producing "waves
lie within comparatively narrow limits,
from about 40,000 to about 70,000 to the
Inch. -Shorter than these are the ultra
violet waves, which affect photographic
plates strongly, vibrating about 10,000.000,-
OOO.Ow times a second, and the X rays no
body knows how many billions of times
a second. Beyond the visible ray 3 at the
other end the; waves of 10,000,000,000.000 to
20,000,000.000.000 vibrations a second pro
duce the effect chiefly of heat, and still
lower in the scale come waves of all f-e
fjuencies down to a comparatively few
thousands a second, and of all lengths,
from a quarter of an inch to many miles.
The effects of these long waves are
chiefly electrical, so far as yet " known,
and they are generally called Hertzian
waves. Â¦ from the name of the man who
first Investigated them systematically..
All other waves, however, are of the
same general electro-magnetic character,
and our classification into X rays and
Rontjren rays, light, dark heat. Is only
an evidence of our limitations in receiv
ing apparatus. With new methods of re
ceiving and detecting such waves new
effects may be produced

CHILD FATALLY CUT
BY FALLING GLASS
Heavy Window Frames Drop Twenty
Feet on Little Leslie
Forsyth.
Charles Leslie Forsyth, aged 4 years,
met with a peculiar accident while at
play yesterday afternoon, receiving In
juries from which he died a few hours
later.
The child was playing in the yard of
the house at 1 Polk street with two other
children, when the heavy glass windows
of . the conservatory on the floor above
in some unaccountable manner broke from
their frames and came crashing down to
the ground, twenty feet below. A large
piece of the glass struck the unfortunate
little fellow and completely covered him.
â¢ The landlady of the house heard the
crash and the screams of the children and
ran at once to the scene, where she found
the child bleeding profusely from many
cuts on the head and body, the glass fall-
Ing with such force that it cut through
the child's cap and clothing. Dr. Pillsbury
was summoned from the Falrmount Hotel
and did' what he could to alleviate the
sufferings of the boy, but death ensued at
6 o'clock.
Mrs. Forsyth, the child's mother. Is a
resident of Portland, Or., where her hus
band is an Insurance agent, and has been
ln the city but a short time, visiting rel
atives. An autopsy will be held to-day.

JUMPED OVERBOARD
FROM PRESIDIO WHARF
Teamster Bogers, Employed at the
Reservation, Ends a Debauch
in the Bay.
Edward Rogers, a teamster employed ln
the quartermaster's department at the
Presidio, ended a Sunday debauch and
his life yesterday by jumping Into the
bay from the Presidio wharf. Rogers
had been working for the quartermaster's
department for six months or more. He
was a drinking man, but he showed no
evidences of an intention to end his life
except now and then to say he would like
to go away. He asked for a furlough of
a month recently and It was declined, and
with that as an excuse he took to drink
with renewed vigor. Yesterday morn
ing, without saying anything to his com
rades, he walked down to the wharf at
the time the McDowell was due and ln
the presence of the few soldiers who were
waiting there he walked off into the
water.
The body was recovered by two Italian
fishermen an hour or two later and was
brought to the Morgue.
John E. Martin, of Company B of the
Twenty-first Infantry died at the General
Hospital yesterday.
Captain Peter C. Deming, commissary
of subsistence of volunteers, has been as

ment pending his assignment to Manila.

Hints on Pronunciation.
1. In pronouncing a French word put
the stress always -upon the last syllab'e.
This stress, or emphasis. Is very slight;
2. Consonants at the ends of words are
not sounded, except c, f, 1 and r. Theso
are generally sounded.
3. The following letters seem to be the
most bothersome to Americans:
g is silent before n, as In magnlflque;
mahn-yee-feek. V
h is usually mute; hotel; o-tell.
qu has almost always the sound of k;
quatre; cat-tr.
Noteâ As in English, q Is always united
with v. and never stands alone.
r Is harder than In English, principally
at the beginning and the end of words.
s between two vowels is like z; refuser;
rah-fuh-zay.
s at the beginning of a word is hissing;
sept: sett.
th has the sound of the English t;
theatre; tay-atr.
Noteâ The English th has no equivalent in
French. The sound of "th" does not exist at
all.
w Is generally like the English v; this
letter Is not used frequently.
Noteâ Students must r.ot give the sound of
the English w to the v.
x at the end of a word Is mute, as doux;
doo. It has sometimes after a vowel the
sound of gs; exemple; eggs-ample.

REASONABLENESS
OF THE TENETS
OF THE CHURCH
Address of Henry C Dillon
on the Subject, "Why I ,
am a Catholic."
Fourth of the Series of Lectures Be
ing Given Under the Auspices
of the Young Men's
The fourth of the series of lectures
being given under the auspices of the
Young Men's Institute was delivered in
Metropolitan Temple last evening by
Henry C. Dillon. His subject was "Why
I Am a Catholic." .
Â¦ In treating of this theme Mr. Dillon
divided it into three parts. The first part
he devoted to an analysis of the evidence,
from a legal standpoint, In support of the
Christian religion, and he declared the
system could not stand without calling
upon the traditional evidence of the Cath
olic church.
He then took up the subject of Cathol
icism and science, between which, he said,
there can be no conflict If all the acts be
rightly understood and fairly compared
with the truths of revelation. He quoted
from the Vatican constitution where It
declares "The church, far from being op
posed to -the arts and sciences, assists
and encourages them."
Turning then to the practical side of his
subject, Mr. Dillon argued that all the
forms and ceremonies of the church have
a reasonable basis and are all calculated
to stimulate the growth of better men
and women, which, after all, he declared,
is the reform of all reforms. He treated
his subject from the standpoint of a law
yer and a layman.
This part of his address was an argu
ment made in defense of the Christian re
ligion, based upon right reason. Taking
for his major premise the divine origin of
man, he argued that it must logically fol
low that he was created for a purpose,
which he could not fulfill without knowing
what that purpose was, and that this pur
pose God has revealed to man. The Old
and New Testaments are but fragments
of this will, he said, and were written
long after the revelations were made to
the church. He believed It was just as
necessary that such a body as the church
should be created and perpetuated, with
power to declare and interpret this will,
as that the United States should have a
Supreme Court to declare what Is the con
stltulon and give final Interpretation of
its meaning, which all citizens are bound
to receive as Infallible, He claims the
Catholic church has been the custodian of
this will from the beginning, and that tlie
Catholic church alone is competent to tes
tify concerning it; and her decrees upon
matters within her jurisdiction must bo
accepted in the same sense as the de
cisions of the Supreme Court.
"Secular thought and criticism may pull
to* pieces the latest revised edition of the
New Testament put forth by the Protest
ants," he said, "and tear to shreds their
discordant creeds, but their weapons fall
harmless when hurled against the Catho
lic church. Her position is Impregnable,
because she says: 'The sacred scriptures
contain only a part of the Christian re
ligion. It was delivered to me entire by
the mouth of Jesus Christ himself. Lan
the only living witness to all that he call
and did. History shows the continuity of
my life. My testimony has always been
the same. I have never told a He. Perse
cutions have never caused me to vary It.
I am the same witness, yesterday, to-day
and forever. If you want to know what
the Christian religion is you must come
and learn of me.'
"Her marvelous growth and vitality
show that the gates of hell never have
prevailed against her, and never can. The
strong parallel shown between the evolu
tion of truth In the material world and
the decrees of the Catholic church estab
lishing the faith, i. c., truth in the spirit
ual world, affords much food for reflec
tion."
The conclusion drawn by the lecturer
was that evolution in the material and
spiritual world go hand In hand, and show
how wonderfully God has created and pre
served man, and is preparing him for his
immortal destiny.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 1900.
SCHOONER LILA
AND MATTIE IS
A TOTAL WRECK
Consuelo and J. D. Spreckels
Soldâ Czarina to Run to"
Honolulu.
Ex-Transport Columbia Purchased by
Governmentâ Captain Rasmus
sen of the Frolic in
- Trouble.
The well-known coasting schooner Lila
and Mattie is now probably a total wreck
In Tillamook Bay. According to the dis
patches from Astoria she went "sshore at
the head of the bay during a southwester.
The tug Harrison attempted to tow her
off, and later the steamer Tillamook came
along and had a try also, but both failed.
Later advices state that the schooner was
got off at high water, but an hour or Â»o
later dragged her anchors and capsized In
the surf. The crew and passengers es
caped, but the chances are that Ihe
schooner and cargo will be a total loss.
The schooner Sacramento got In trouble
at Tillamook while the Lila and Mattie
was in port, and the crew refused to come
to San Francisco on her. The men tcok
passage with Captain Ostlln and were
aboard the Lila and Mattie when she wjiit
ashore. They worked hard along with the
crew to save the vessel, and succeeded In
getting her off the beach, but when tho
gale came up again and the schooner cap
sized all their labor went for nothing.
There was a strike on the pilot boat
America last Friday, and In consequence
a half-dozen pilots were unable to get to
their station outside the lightship. When
Captain Frank Murphy, who was in com
mand of the America for the cruise, got
aboard one of the deck hands demanded
$40 a monthâ an advance of $5. The de
mand came as a surprise, and the master
of the boat naturally wanted to know ilw
reason. The answer he got was that tho
Sailors' Union was behind the demand.
Sailors on coasting vessels are as a gen
eral rule getting $40 a month. They have
to handle the cargo and do all kinds of
hard work. When business la slack their
wages are cut; when there Is a rush and
men are In demand they ask and get a
big advance. On the pilot boats the sail
ors get a uniform wage of $35 a month the
year round. They are as well found and
housed as on any private yacht In the
world, and in consequence the strike came
as a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. At
the headquarters of the coast seamen it
was learned yesterday that the strike on
the America was wholly unwarranted and
that the union had nothing whatever to do
with it. Tfte crew of the pilot boat acted
on their own individual accounts and had
no order from headquarters.
"The union is not interfering In any
way with pilot boats and yachts," said the
assistant secretary. "On that class of ves
sels the men as a rule have an easy time
and a uniform wage, and there Is In -sonse.
quence no kick coming."
The Oceanic Steamship Company has
sold two of Its sailing vessels, and in con
sequence the steamer Czarina has been
put on the Honolulu run by the company.
The brig John D. Spreckels has been slid
to the Western Commercial Company
(Bennett & Goodall) and will load for
Guam, and the brig Consuelo has been
sold to Charles Nelson and will load for
Mahukona. The Czarina arrived at Seat
tle yesterday, but will receive freight at
Paclflc-street wharf on the 20th insL for
Honolulu and will sail March 25.
The Government has purchased the
steamer Columbia from the Northern Pa
cific Steamship Company. The vessel has
been In the employ of the transport ser
vice for nearly a year and has been carry-
Ing troops to Manila. A vessel is wanted
for the transport service between here and
Alaska, however, and the purchase of the
Columbia was recommended. She will
make trips during the season neiveen
here and St. Michael, and will thssi go on
the regular Manila run for the remainder
of the year.
Captain Rasmussen of the tug Frolfc It.
In a peck of trouble with his wife. Sun
day the gallant skipper was entertaining
a lady friend on his boat, when Mrs. Ras
mussen put in an appearance. The "lady
friend" fared badly during the subsequent
proceedings. â¢ The Irate wife knocked her
down, and repeated the dose when she got
on her feet again. A third blow sent the
"lady friend" overboard, and then Captain
Rasmussen went over after her. Mrs.
Rasmussen thought both husband and his
friend were going to be drowned, and
promptly fainted. After a lot of explain
ing everything came out right, but Cup
tain Rasmussen was around the front
wearing a very sad and pensive look yes
terday.-
The yacht Verona, formerly the Vega,
has been purchased from C. Thornberg by
Henry Lester, Julius Bach and Arthur
Garob. She will fly the California Yacht
Club colors and will be In commission mxt
Sunday. Herry Lester, one of the new
owners of the Verona, and Eugene Flan
ders, owner â¢of the new launch Alert,
which is to have her trial trip next Sun
day, are going to the Paris Exposition
next August. Â¦ -
F A Moore met with a serious accident
at Howard-street wharf yesterday. A door
fell on him. dislocating his left shoulder
and fracturing his spine. He was treated
at the Harbor Hospital by Dr. Bacigalupl.
The collier Benmohr struck on an un
charted rock while leaving Oyster Bay
last Saturday. She was examined at Es
quimalt, but as there was no appearance
of a leak she started for San Francisco
and -will arrive to-morrow.

Chicago advanced slightly, but; the strength
was largely due to the activity of and firm
ness In Corn. Liverpool was lower and Paris
higher. There was an Increase of 4,250.000
bushels on passage and a decrease of 390,000
bushels In the American visible supply. The
Government report was bullish on Corn, but
not on Wheat. It showed the amount of Wheat
In farmers' hands March 1 at 158.700,000 bushels,

CHICAGO. March 12.â Corn took the lead of
the speculative markets at the beginning of
the session, as it did Saturday, and held it
throughout a sensational day. Interest In the
coarse cereal has not been so general In years
as It was to-day. The predictions were made
that the market would follow cotton and "go
wild" within a short time, basing. the predic
tions on the chances of unfavorable conditions
during the planting season. The greater part
of the session- the pit was a struggling 'mass of
frantic men, none more frantic than the shorts,
who were compelled to cover with heavy losses.
Fortunes were made and lost in that wild
scramble for the cereal which the statistics
showed was getting rather scarce In many sec
tions. May opened Â»i&%cs over Saturday at
36%4i3G%c. The Government report, which
seemed to be the main motive In the upward
course of the market, showea 27,000,000 bushels
more in farmers' hands than there was a year
ago. The quantity on ocean passage decreased
2.208,000 bushels and Is now down to 9,848 000
bushels. The visible increased over a mil
lion, but the supply is now 21,b60,000 â¢ bushels
compared with 34,033,000 bushels a year ago'
The world's shipments were small and Liver
pool' was up %d. This array of Information
furnished the stimulus for the Initial gain and
the awakening of shorts and others. , The
price until 11 o'clock did not vary much from
the opening figures. Then it began to shoot
up. Nothing could stop It apparently and
as the anxious shorts bid higher and higher
men In other pita quit their work to look on
If not to participate. The demand seemed
limitless although the advance carried the
cash article out of line with export bids. May
touched 38@38%0 on the bulge and closed lT4c
over Saturday at 37%Â®35c. . :
The corn market began to move upward from
29% c about four months ago. Saturday tbe close
was at 36@36%c for May.
The wheat market was dominated by the corn
strength. The statistics were bearish. There
was a large Increase In world's shipments
and on passage and receipts were heavy. Cables
were steady, making about the only Independ
ent support the market had throughout the
session, when It was drowned out of the com
mercial orchestra by noise In the corn pit.
The cash demand was checked by the advance
and altogether the trade was not Important,
being merely a feeble reflection of the corii
market. May opened unchanged at MT43J Â«(,<Â¦,
touched 65% c and recovered to 4tf%e, with corn!
closing He over Saturday at 6<>Â£c4{S<%c. .
The trade In oats was not lmoortsnt, hut
the market was helped by tne corn strength.

Provisions were strong, and the trade broad.

LOCAL MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 12.â T0-day's stock mar
ket was unmistakably strong throughout. The
demonstrated indifference Â»t the market on
Saturday to the s=wlft depletion of the surplus
reserves of New Y<Tk hanks took the malnstay
nf the bears from l*-neath them. The demand
from Fh-jrt interest was a factor in the ad
vance in prices, especially In the Industrials,
which have recently t>een undt-r pressure.
There- were - several elements of i>osltive
ptrvr-gth in the market also, but the largest
part at the buying was undoubtedly due to
the effort of the vrofessional element among
the speculators to discount the effect of the
currency Mil. Not only the smaller class of
l>rof*-i=j>ii;nals who have recently had the mar-
Ket to themselves but operators of larger
Â¦ mold gave evidence of their interest in the
miarket. The demands made by the increased
activity ot the stock market upon the money
market was evidenced In a flurry in the loan
rate to G i*-r cent. Speculators lÂ»ald no atten
tion 10 this admonitory symptom, apparently
convince that the end Â«f the money market
troubles wa* reached with the enactment of
the new currency law which in to be aÂ«nt to
the President to-morrow. There were occas
ional periods cf dullness in the market, ap
jjarently with a view to testing It. The quick
fubsldence of activity without any reaction in
; rrci and the firmness of the resistance to
decline confirmed the confidence of the bulls
and started prices up again. The closing was
<juite actli'e and strong at near, the top level.
The principal galm were In the active Indus
trials and Hpecialties. Including Sugar, To
bacco, People's Gas, Anaconda, the Iron and
feieel stocks and the New York public utilities
ranged from 2 to over 4 points, tbe latter In
Sugar. In the railroad lift St. Paul was the
leader, both In point of activity and strength,
rising an extreme 2%.. The other grangers, the
Eouthwesterns and a number of the trunk lines
and Southern railroads gained a point or more.
A feature of the trading was the number of
three-day contracts recorded on the tape. In
dicating the expectation of easier money with
tbe operation of the new financial bill. There
was a generous sprinkling of transactions In
fractional lots all through the list. Indicating
an Investment demand, which had no small
part In the feeling of confidence evidenced by
the speculative contingent. A .background of
tci-rr.gth to the whole market was aSorded by
the large absorption of railroad bonds,
especially those of the higher grade. This
must undoubtedly be attributed to tbe pressure I
; for reinvestment of funds which have been ;
rr-alized by investors who have sold Govern
ment bonds at the high prices prevailing, the
dunks buying them to use for security for '
circulation. It â¢â¢ems to escape notice that this
is in a measure an anticipatory employment
.of the extended circulation, since the capital j
Of the national banks which has gone for tbe
j.ayment of these bonds looks to bank note
:.s?uÂ«-s for Its release and re-employment. Lon
don was a liberal buyrr of stocks In this mar
ket and considerable â¢rntimental Influence was
exerted by the largÂ» subscription* reported to
Ye n.U'2- in New York to the new British loan.
It is argueS that thnre subscriptions indicate
an abundance of capital and they will repre
rent also a quickly convertible foreign ;redlt
upon which the country can draw in case of
reed in the n:oney market. Reports of rail
road earnings tor the first week in March were
encouraÃing. A good effect was produce-1 also
by the 6tatcn;Â«-nt of exports for February Â».Â»
agricultural products, the large increase In
value of cotton experts tor tbe month giving
It the record for February.
Tbe bond market was active and strong
throughout. Total ealee, par value, $2,205,000.

istered) declined (i: new 4s (coupon) % and the

There was a happy tone 1 to the markets here
to-day and a light Increase in business for the

as expected, though contangoes were rather
stiffer. Indicating that speculation is Increas
ing. Interest Is now centered in the war loan,

LADIES AT BATTLES.
Man-Killing Spectacles That Go Off
. : Like a Play.
It la reported from Ladysmlth. sayÂ»
London Truth, that Boer ladles, drtsaed
in their best, gather every Sunday after
noon on the hills which dominate the be
sieged.town to witness the bombardment.
ThTa is not by any means the first time
that women have attended the battlefield
an spectators. In La.nfrey's "Hlstolre da
Napoleon I" occurs a passage which pur
ports to be -a conversation which Napo
leon had with Las Casas: "Riding; with,
her* (his mistress) one day In the middle
ot our â¢ positions In the environs of thÂ«
hill of Tenda. -while reconnoitering aÂ»
commander ,' of Â¦ the artillery, the- notion
suddenly occurred to me of: treating her
to the spectacle of a little war. and I or
dered an attack of advanced posts, wa
Â¦were the conquerors. It is true, but therÂ»
could evidently be ho result- The attack:
was a pure fancy, and yet. some men fell
in it. I have bitterly reproached myself
with this affair whenever it has recurred
to me.". Many of our fashionable ladlesâ
hard-eyed,' loud-voiced. firm-stepped, over
dressed, in the day and underdressed at
nightâ might not object to be present at
a battle. Had they lived In Roman times
tht-y could have witnessed these and hu
man sacrifices in the arenaâ but then
there were no opera glasses. Now that
we have opera glasses we have no gladia
tors and no martyrs!

mount the scaffold to-day. He felt that
If r*e did he would stand in imminent dan
ger of death or come great injury.
But he ignored this feeling and bravely
resumed hi? labors.
This afternoon he was taken to the- Re
ceiving Hospital, where Drs. Porter and
Stratton reduced a bad fracture of the
right arm below the shoulder. A board
of the scaffold on which Van Haltren stood
working had given away and the lather
fell a distance of over twenty fe*.t, strik
ing on the Joist below. He was pir-ked
â¢up unconscious and it was supposed he
had struck on his head and that nis skull
wa.Â« fractured.
"I will never again in all my life Ignore
bad omens. When I started to work this
morning I had a presentiment that tome
thtr.g pretty serious was going to happen
to me If I mounted that scaffold, but I
pave it the go by and here I am. with a
broken arm. It's a wonder I wasn't killed.

Plucky Woman Shoots -Into

Dare Her to Fire.
Mrs. A. Brendenmuho, Wife of a
Fruitvale_Florist, Drives Off a
Gang of; Miscreants Who .
Persecuted Her.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. March 12.
Because a crowd of rowdies Invaded the
gardens of A. Brendenmuho, a florist, at
Upper Fruitvale. yesterday afternoon, and
refused to peacefully depart, Mrs. Bren
denmuho made a plucky attack upon the
mob oi unruly picnickers, routing them
by sending a couple â¢of charges -from a
shotgun in their direction.
The florist's wife was alone at home
when the miscreants on mischief bent
piled into the gariiens, which are' filled
with valuable. plants. The trespassers be
gan to tear up Mowers and to wreck the
place. Attracted by their depredations
Mrs. Bror.rienmuho went forth to drive
off the intruders, but moral suasion; was
without avail. The crowd jeered at the
defenseless woman, and dared her to
come on.
'She was unable to find any- men to go
to the rescue of tho plants and to disperse
the gang. As a last .resort she decided to
try something stronger than words. Re
turning to the cottage, the florist's wife
got a shotgun, loaded both barrels and
marched forth upon the crowd. Â¦
A hundred feet from them the woman
stopped ar.d cried;
"You must leave this place at once or
I will shoot.*' s â¢Â¦Â¦.'.
"Oh, that isn't loaded." â¢
"You don't know how to shoot."
And jeers and laughter came from the
crowd, Â¦
They did not realize that they had a de
termined antagonist, even if there was
only a woman with whom to Weal. Exas
perated beyond measure. Mrs. Brenden
muho raised the gun to her shoulder and
"bang, bang." Both charges ffew in the
direction <>f the crowd, which took flight
so quickly that before the smoke from tha
gun had blown away fifteen or twenty
young men woro tearing down Fruitvale
avenue a3 quickly as they could go. Resi
dents of the district hay* appealed for
protection from the crowds who commit
depredations there on Sundays.

AT TANFORAN
Judges Suspected Toribio
Was Not Ridden to
Win by Ruiz. .
Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ...Â¦
Clever Eider, Together With Owner
Stanfleld, Suspended Fending
Investigation â : Three
'"." . r .-' Favorites in Front.
Jockey Ruiz, the Southern California
strong boy, waited so long and patiently
with Toribio. a 1 to 2 favorite for the fifth
number at Tanforan yesterday, that the
crowd let out a mighty roar. The horse
looked "a moral,", and when beaten la
slow time by both Merry Boy and Wyo
ming, to say the least, it did look peculiar.
Buchanan astride Merry Boy took all
kinds of liberties with .his mount, and
then, when ready, won in a gallop. Ruiz
did the same with the horse he rode, but
did not win. So many of these Â¦ Â»hort
priced nags have been shelved at the San
Mateo track that the judges no doubt felt
compelled to take action. They declared
all bets off, which met with the hearty
approval of the crowd, and besides sus
pended Ruiz and W. L. Stanfield. the
owner of Toribio, pending further Investi
gation.
It was reopening day at the Western
Turf Association's track. The weather
was warm and track fast. Three favor
ites managed to earn brackets.
M. F. Tarpey, from the Corrigan
etables captured the two-year-old scram
ble. The youngster ruled a warm choice,
beating Lucldia and Lilly Dlggs with ease.
Marty Bergen had the mount on The
Lady in the seven furlong affair follow
ing, so the crowd backed Decoy, making
the colt favorite. Bsrgen wafted some
time with The Lady, eventually coming
on through and downing the first choice
a neck, amid -tremendous applause. Tekla
ran into the show.
Potente, held at odds on the ring, made
a cakewalk of the mile j and a furlnng
handicap after Anchored bad led to the
stretch. Morlnel -lost the place to Red
Pirate.
For the fourth number Limerick, Miss
Marion and True Blue finished three noses
on the post in the order named. The win
ner, a 6 to 1 shot, received excellent hand
ling at the hands of Jack Martin.
With any sort of a fair start Sardine
could. have taken the closing five, and a
half furlong spin. She was almost loft
and then ran a close third behind the fa
vorite. May W, and Miss Rowena.
Track Notes.
Frank Eckert laid heavily against Tori
bto, and the decision did not suit him a
little bit.
Only thirteen books cut In, quite a fall
ing off from Oakland.
Caesar Young and his crew leave for the
East to-night.
Combermere was not allowed to start In
the opening event because It was claimed
he was ndt registered In time to make
him eligible. The Judges also said there
was some doubt as to his ownership. No
explanations would be listened to, and
with this dangerous customer out of tha
way Corrtgran's M. F. Tarpey won easily.
Combermere can start In future.

8-!LITTLE EVA SULLIVAN, 13 years'
old, was caught in one of. the. re
volving piles of the Fourth-street
drawbridge yesterday morning and
swung round till not a stitch of clothing
remained on her back. Her left arm was
broken and her right arm badly crushed,
and although Brldgekeeper Charles Lou
derback swooned away after he had pulled
the child from her perilous position the
little one never lost consciousness, but re
tained enough presence of mind to direct
those who came to her rescue.
Little Eva is the daughter of Mrs. Pat
rick Foley of 228% Rltch street. Yesterday
morning, the first of her week's vacation '
from school, she started out with a
little friend, Annie Marks,, to get some
wood for her mother. When the children
came to the drawbridge at Fourth and
Channel streets little Eva leaned against
the first great beam, which began 'to re
volve, swinging the little girl, who clung
to It, wildly round. The. revolving of the
first beam set the second,. which unlocks
the bridge, In motion and the unfortunate
child was caught between the two mas
sive poles. The unfortunate girl's com
panion, Annie Marks, tried to pull Eva
from out of her perilous station, but
failed.
Bridgetender Charles Louderback finally
extricated the child from between the
ADVEKTiSiiaTENTS.
SENATOR FAIR'S
SECRET WAS NOT
WELL GUARDED
Many Witnesses Swore They
Knew of His Marriage to
Mrs. Craven.
Alexander McArthur and Mrs. Carrie
Purcell Testify to Having t Seen
the Contract Before the
Millionaire's Death.
?
If the late Senator James G. Fair was
secretly married to Mrs. Craven in 1892
the secret was not carefully guarded, for
It appears from the number of witnesses
who have come forward to testify to the
fact that the schoolteacher was in the
habit of Imparting the information that
she was the wife of the eccentric multi
millionaire to her friends and acquaint
ances on the slightest provocation. Two
new witnesses were produced by- the
Craven-Fair attorneys yesterday who
knew of the marriage and who had been
shown the contract, and each told an ap
parently straightforward story.
The day's proceedings opened with tho
cress-exam! nation of B. R. J^ane, lessee
Of the Leor;a Heights Hotel. He identi
fied a typewritten statement signed by
" him to the effect that he was employed
in the Park Hotel in Alarm-da in 1834,
when James G. Fair is alleged to have
spent one night there with Mrs. Craven-
Fair, and that upon his departure he in
formed the witness that the lady was his
wife and to take good care of her while
the remained.
â¢ AlexanOer McArthur, the husband of
Mrs. Craven-Fair's sister, was the next
witness. He testified that he was an at
torney living in Denver, but that previous
to IÂ£S3 he had boea employed in the
Treasury Department at Washington,
D. C. He .said he met Mrs. Craven-Fair
in June of ISS3 at the home of a relative,
Mrs. Cherry, in Washington. lowa.
"Did you at that time have any conver
sation with Mrs. Craven concerning her
relations with Senator Fair?" asked At
torney Pence.
"Mrs. Craven-Fair eald Senator Fair
was her husband and showed me a con
tract with him as evidence of their mar
riage." was the answer.
Witness was shown the contract and
ideiitififcd it as the instrument exhibited
to him at Washington, lowa.
The- ellorts of Attorney Pence to get
McArthur to repeat statements made to
him ty his eister-in-law at the time she
showed him the marriage contract were
foiled by the objections of Attorney
McEnerney, which were sustained by the
court. The cross-examination of the wit
ness by Attorney Pierson was brief and
brought out nothing new.
Mrs. Carrie Purcell, a dressmaker re
siding at 1630 Howard street, was the first
and only witness examined at the after
noon session, and her testimony was
strongly corroborative of that of other
witnesses who have preceded her rela
tive to the marriage and the existence
of the marriage contract. She' testified
that she had met Mrs. Craven in ISBB. and
had been more or less intimate with her
in both a business and friendly way ever
cince. Mrs. Purcell first saw the mar
riage contract in the cummer of 1592. She
was fitting a dress for Mrs. Craven-Fair,
when a large envelope fell from the bosom

THE more we see of "New Tork suc
cesses" the less cause we have for
acceptance, not to Bay tolerance, of
these metropolitan "hits," "Be
cause She Loved Him So," which
was given at the Columbia last night. Is
the latest," the lightest and least of these
over-heralded offerings.
It is an adaptation by William Gillette
of a farce by Bisson, but the effective
comedy of the adapter's original efforts
and the diverting inconsequence and lively
humor of the French playsmlth are never
effectively expressed.
The first act of "Because She Loved
Him So" is hopelessly talky and dull
and the want of action is felt for a full
half of the evening's entertainment.
There are minutes and minutes that seem
like hours of insignificant dialogue and
one is reminded irresistibly of that flat
failure (also a New York success) "The
Cuckoo." ' :
To make matters worse the players of
the Columbia company do not succeed in
making themselves heard and one - finds
one's self straining to catch an occasional
word and wondering what it is all about.
When the purpose of the plot finally
asserts itself in the second act you begin
to look for a -little acting, and a little
acting is the best you get.
J. E. Dodson, who is almost famous as
a character actor, has an old man part
which he pictures to perfection, but there
is little beyond his admirable make-up to
make him notable. He did things in sup
port of Mr. and Mrs. Kendall that have
not stuck in our memory and we unfor
tunately have not now the opportunity to
judge of his versatility. Could we see
him now in two or three or four parts
he might develop a value that now one
can only guess at, but as far as his work
in comedy and character Is concerned in
the present production his occasional
finesse is very much injured by Inartistic
exaggeration and clownishness that are
not a part of the first-cut comedians.
Miss Annie Irish, who has held our
sympathy with an exquisitely fascinating
picture of Southern womanhood in "A
Virginia Courtship," is thrown away upon
the part of Gertrude West, and Francis
Carlisle was much better in "The l>ark
Secret" than he is in a frock coat and
matrimonial squabbles.
I have no doubt that Messieurs Bisson
and Leclerque made much of the vital
element In the plot of this play, which is
briefly as follows: Owen West, who is
young, andihis wife, who is likewise, are
forced into mutual suspicion and semi
estrangement through the machination of
their servants. The father and mother
of Mrs. West are informed of the calam
ity, and In order to divert the attention
of their daughter and her husband from
their own inimical attitude they agree to
disagree violently themselves. Mr. Dod
son and Mis'a Meek as the old couple do
all that ls^comic in the play, and It Is Miss
Meek that succeeds in giving the true
touch. She is frequently clever.
Maggie Fielding In the part of an inde
pendent Irish maid Is delicious within the
small compass of the character. She does
the most truthful bit of acting in the play.

Sergeant of Police Shea was given in

on Washington street, early on the morn-
Ing of March 6, 1b being held captive by
Chinese in a swamp near Vallejo. This
morning officers will leave this city for
the purpose of bringing him back. Jue
Hok, the latest victim of the man now
wanted by the police, is a Suey Sing high
binder and is at present being treated at
the City and County Hospital. He will
this morning swear to a warrant charg
ing Jung Ah Lock with the crime. Shea
was told that Hok' s friends followed the
man from San Francisco and finally lo
cated him. The Chief of Police was im
mediately Informed and two officers, ac
companied by a Suey Sing man, will go
to the scene this morning.
Strained relations still exist among the
highbinders. Two of tho tongs now at
war. with the Suey Sings have expressed
their intention of settling the trouble, but
a third will not agree to any such pro
ceeding. The obstinate tong is the Sin

bring its 'leader. Song Hung, at present In

Suey Sings are willing that the hatchet
should be buried, and -when the Sin Sue

prevail. It is probable that some time
will elapse before this can be accomplish

held yesterday, that If a settlement was
not soon effected drastic measures would
be employed to stop the trouble and a

KILLED ON THE LINE.
Railroad Commission's Report Shows
Astounding Loss of Life by
Accident.
The principal business accomplished at
the regular monthly meeting of the Rail
road Commission, which was held yester
day, was the perfecting and adoption of
the commission's report for the year end
ing December 31, 1599.
The report, which will be forwarded to
Governor Gage, shows the mileage debts
and earnings of the ' forty-five roads re
porting to the commission; this number
includes all the subdivisions of the
Southern Pacific Company that come un
der the jurisdiction of this State.
An interesting detail In connection with
the report is the number of; accidents it
shows for the year. Of course these fig
ures include those killed or injured on
all the roads of the State, but as the
number hurt ' on roads â¢ not belonging to
the Pacific, system of the Southern Pa
cific is so small as to hardly be worth the
mention, the list may be considered as a
report of Huntington casualties.
The report gives fifty-one as the num
ber of employes killed and 529 as the
number injured. Of passengers and oth
ers not belonging to the road seventy-five
have lost their lives during the past year
and 121 have been hurt. Tht3 gives a
total of 126 killed s and 650 injured, a
greater loss than has occurred in action
In Luzon In the same length of time.
Some Idea may be had of the profit that
will accrue to the Southern Pacific Com
pany from its new Insurance scheme
when It is considered that it will prevent
suits for damage and when the suits pos
sible In one State alone are shown by the
above recorded table of horrors.
The Commissioners will go to Los An
geles on March 26 to meet the members of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
who are to meet there on March 27. The
Interstate Commission, will meet in this
city on April 2. and will be given the
rooms of the State Commission in which

of her dress.
"I made some remark about it," said
witness, "and Mrs. Craven told me she
had been married to Senator Fair, and
that the document was the marriage con
tract. She handed the contract to me
and I read it. It had been recently exe
cuted and was dated May 23, 1592."
Mrs. Purcell further testified that In the
fall of 1554 she went to Mrs. Craven-
Fair's house to spend the night. She
found the Senator there and remarked
that she would not stay, whereupon the
Senator said:
"You may come in; you are all right."
Witness afterward recalled another
meeting with Senator Fair In the Cali
fornia Hotel in . the early part of 1893.
when he referred to the schoolteacher
as his wife and said she was "tied to him
now and could not run away."
On cross-examination Attorney Pierson
tried to tangle witness on dates and facts,
but she refused to contradict herself. Her
cross-examination will be resumed, at 11
o'clock this morning.
Past Grand Fox's Golden Jubilee.
There was a large attendance last night
at the meeting of California Lodge of
Odd Fellows to congratulate Past Grand
Master C. N. Fox on the golden jubilee of
his anniversary in Odd Fellowshp. Thera
were a number of appropriate addresses
and a very pleasant one by the visiting
veteran. /
any who desire to give themselves to God,
will they not rise? Will all those who
are Christians please stand?' This Is
a hard test; the regulars stand,
some remain sitting; some He by
standing, some deny by sitting. The hon
est but unsatisfied inquirer or the casual
visitor feels that he has been placed in
an awkward and unwarranted position."
In conclusion Mr. Watt said:
"So long as the laity Is careless of Its
obligations, personal service and money
contributions; so long as the clergy seek
convenience and income; so long as of
ficial life is preferred to the ministry;. so
long as Bishops shun a residence in a
hard field because it Is hard; so long as
our religion does not make us different in
motive; so long we have little reason to
hope for progress.
"We are mutually responsible for the
present situation. Unfortunately, there Is
a decay of faith, a decrease of vital godli
ness, of religion in the home. This fact
we must recognize. If It were not so our
church would not be living a miserable
existence in this city after forty years of
endeavor and losing ground everywhere."
to call the Bishop to account."
Upon the subject of the control of
church matters, Air. Watt said:
"There is in our church an aristocracy
of officialism. These men hobnob together,
confer with each other and in all respects
act as if they were the masters or the
situation, and as a matter of fact they
really are. The most dominant men in
general conference are General Conference
officers. They largely shape and control
legislation and. worst of all, pass upon
their own work.
"Our revival methods, oh, how stereo
typed! The world progresses, but the an
nual revival never. No one can object to
the songs of praise if they are well sung,
the prayers If they are short and to the
point, the sermon If it is good, nor the
testimonies If they are from honest
hearts and experiences; but the "round
up." the horror of some of the methods
resorted to to get men to a decision, vot
ing, holding up hands, moving for
ward, standing or sitting alternatively q^
directed by the leaderâ how often we hear
the invitation: 'If there are any who
would ask the prayers of God's people.
why? Because we provide for everything
*:?Â»> before setting any aside for G^d's
â¢work."
In discussing the ministers Mr. Watt as
1 scned that there is too much carelessness
in the pulpitâ carelessness In thought, in
expression and In manner.
"I sometimes fear the men now entering
the ministry are not up to the average of
those entering other professions," said lift.
Â¦"If this is true we will soon feel the ei
fects. No preacher ever became so wise
as to need do further study; no preaci'er
<>ver preached so well that improvemÂ«nt
was impossible. Of all people In the
Â¦world the clergyman can least afford to be
Idle or careless or indifferent or ignorant."
The high officials of the church aiso
came !n for a lVw scathing remarks, aÂ»J
especially was the power and authority of
those heads criticized. Mr. Watt said:
"The Bishops have almost despotic con
trol of UjOOO Methodist preachers, fixing
their place? of residence and therefore
approximately fixing their salaries. This
autocratic power, which is sometimes
used arbitrarily. If as a lash held over
the back, and few men have the temerity

OLD MAN RESCUED FROM
A HORRIBLE DEATH
W. W. Cox Snatched From in Front
of a Rapidly Moving Train by
Officer John Young.
W. W. Cox, a man 75 years of age,
residing at 1135 Castro street, was rescued
from a horrible death last evening by Po
liceman John Young, who, at the risk of
his own- life, snatched the old man from
in front of a rapidly moving Southern
Pacific train. The rescue was made near
the crossing at Valencia and Twenty-fifth
streets as the' 5:10 San Jose train was Jour
neying southward. Cox, who is partially
deaf, was walking rapidly toward the
moving engine unconscious of his danger.
Officer Young saw him and tried to attract
his attention, but was unsuccessful.
Young then walked along the track,
thinking the engineer would slow up on
seeing him. On account of a bend in the
track at that point he was not seen by
the engineer, so Young, realizinz that only
instant action would save Cox.-ran toward
him and pulled him oft the track just as
the train thundered by. Young barely got
out of harm's way, while Cox was so
dazed by the sudden shock that he for
a time did not realize how close he had
been to a terrible death. When the truth
dawned upon him the old gentleman was
profuse in his thanks to, his. brave de
liverer.
