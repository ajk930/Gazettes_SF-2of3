LONDON, March 12.â
News from South Africa
this morning, in addition
to the confirmation of the report
that Presidents Kruger and Steyn
have" made overtures to "Great
Britain looking to the ending of
the war, at the same time invit
ing the intervention of European
powers through their consular
representatives in Pretoria, tells
of Lord Roberts' successful at
tack at Drietfontein, driving the
Boers back, and of his successful
advance to Aasvogel, which ,is
only twenty-five miles from
Bloemfontein.
This action practically puts the
Free State capital at the mercy of
the British. Lord Roberts' vic
tor}' over the Boer rear guard ap
peared to have been decisive. The
burghers withstood the cavalry
and horse artillery of Generals
Colville and Kelly-Kenny,. but
were turned and dislodged by' the
infantry. The Welsh and Essex
regiments drove the Boers from
their intrenched positions at the.
point of the bayonet.
The British losses are un
known, as the troops continued
to advance, but Lord Roberts
has telegraphed the names of a
few officers. The Boer losses
must have been considerable, as
102 of their dead were left on the
field. ;3:V
Aasvogel Kop, which the Brit
ish reached last night, was ex
pected to be the last place, at
which the Boers would make
their stand before Bloemfontein.
It would appear that no such
stand was made and that Rob
erts' cavalry are now practically
at the gates of Bloemfontein and
the way to the capital is -now
open to the whole force.
The insurrection in the west of
Cape Colony is spreading. Lord
Kitchener is now on the spot tak
ing steps to suppress it. An inde
; cisive action was fought Tues
day near Britstown .between the
rebels and a force- composed of
! City Volunteers "and .the War
wickshire Regiment. â¢

Half-Orphan Claims Are Contested.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. March 11.â The decree
has gone. forth from the State Board of
Examiners that â¢ the $200.0000 worth of
claims for the support of half Â¦ orphans,
now on file In that office, will not be al
lowed and if the counties which put them
in, either through their own officers or
through claim agents, want their money
they will have to sue for it. Daniel Ke-.
vane, secretary of the Board of Examin
ers, declines to approve any such claim
filed previous to IS9S and 3Jr. Kevane not
only' personifies the entire Board of Ex
aminers, but he is locally, regarded as the
authorized representative of Governor
Gage in matters affecting the finances of
thÂ« ( State. The determination of Mr.
Kevane may therefore be accepted -as
conclusive of the stand of the administra
tion respecting these claims.
Secretary Kevane and the members of
the -Board of Examiners will not affirm
itt but the attitude of this bureau respect-,
ing, these claims is commonly regarded as
a slap at the office of the State Controller.
The connection between- the two may
seem remote at first.. but that It exists is
declared to be susceptible of demonstra
tion. ;:T, ; . > * Â¦.-; :-.
It is now a familiar fact that State Con
troller Colgan ,haÂ» "held up" the claims
of the engineers or the State Department
of Public Works even after their passage
by the auditing board of that commission,
and their approval by the State Board of
Examiners. The Controller maintains this
attitude on the strength of an opinion ren
dered some time ago by Attorney General
Ford as to the tenure of the Commis
sioner of Public Work under the law pass
ed by the Legislature of 1899.
Easy Money in Sight!
- W.""W. ."Douglas Is the chief "deputy In
the office of the State. Controller and has
been for 5 years/ Mr. Douglas has a
brother, J. E.*Doiiglias,' who is a member
â¢of .the firm of Pyburn & Douglas, claim
agents. It is asserted that through the
business of 'collecting, old. claims due thi
.countles_frqm the State for the support of
Indigent* and "half Orphans this firm has
grown rich. In one instance â that of tha
Yolo County claims â It ' is asserted the
firm of Pyburn & Douglas realized a clear
profit of some $6000. In the case of Los
Angeles County, it is declared, another
$6000 .was cleaned up by the firm.
Those who are J commenting on these
matters at this time assert that It Is not
extravagant to say. that, the firm of Py
burn & Douglas have realized some $50,000
or $50.000 ' in commissions from the coun
ties on back claims due from the State.
It Is also asserted by those who think that
the engineers of the Commission of Pub
lic .Works should' be paid, that no legal
obstacle was raised by the State Con-*
troller's office to the payment of these
old claims, on which the firm of Pyburn
& Douglas drew down commissions of 2S
per cent, although with most of them.'
since they ran as far back aa twenty
years, the statute of limitations could
have been invoked by the Controller's of-"
flee were the desire ' present.
Many of the claims now held up in tha
Board . of : Examiners are of the sama
character as those mentioned. Many of:
them. it. is asserted, have been gathered
up by the firm of Pyburn & Douglas.
Legal Objection Found.
The Controller's office declines to allow
the Board of Public Works' claims on thÂ»
ground that a legal obstacle exists to their
payment. The Board of Examiners, as
represented by Daniel Kevane, secretary,
declines â¢to Â¦ allow these back claims - in,
favor of the counties put in by Pyburn-&
Douglas and others because it la declared
the statute of limitations applies to them.
Thus the situation stands, and it gives
promise of some Interesting developments.-
Secretary, of State Curry, a. member of
the Board of Examiners, declares that this-
State Controller, and Deputy Douglas have
acted entirely within their conception oC
the law. of the case. and. in fact, thl*
seems to be the general view. But the
salaries of the engineers are unpaid and
the old claims of the counties, submitted
In part by Pyburn &â¢ Douglas,- are being
held up: and the circumstance- has fur
nished a breezy topic in and about thÂ«*
Capitol. . â¢ â¢ .
If the opinion of M. A. Nurse, chief en
gineer of the Commission of Public Work*,
were to be given, with an attempt at lit
eral reproduction, the â¢ frequent use- cf
dashes would be essential. Said Mr. Nota
to The Call representative to-day: .
Ford's Opinion.
â¢'Attorney General Ford told Frank D.
Ryan, the present Commissioner of Public
Works, that be thought the claims of my
self and Colonel Heuer,. consulting en
gineer, ought to be paid, and was wi',llnÂ«
and anxious that they should be paid. My
salary claim Is JSOu. that of Colonel Heuer
$600: besides there are traveling expense*
of *40 and $100 for the assistant secretary
of the board for four months. In all $lt?ti
These claims' were passed upon by \hÂ»
auditing board and submitted to the State
Board of Examiners. The Governor ap-'
proved jhem and said he would encourage
their payment. One day Colonel H^uer
and I went into the Controller's office t.>
pay our respects to Mr. Colsran. We re
marked something about having to wat
a : while for our pay. whereupon '"Deputy
Controller Douglas said: 'Send the claims
down to us and see how-long we will hoM
them up.' ' From - this remark ' Colonel
Heuer and myself Inferred that the Con
troller, intended to draw warrants for oar
claims. The Board of Examiners approved
them , and a long wait . ensued, 4urin<
which Deputy Douglas went to San Fran
cisco to see the Attorney General aDout
the claims. The latter .said that he waa
willing and anxious to see them paid, hut
he did not wish <to commit himself to a
written- opinion. ' Presently we received
the ultimatum of the Controller's office
our claims wouldnot be'pald. ;' "... :"
: "Our -special grievance is the refusal to
give Colonel Heuer the salary due him. It,
was only "by the most repeated persuasion
that we Induced him to become the con
sulting ; engineer of .'our- board. Colonel
Heuer stands high in the army engineer
ing corps. He has -had charge of big gov
ernmental %work on ;the ' Mississippi and
Ohio, rivers. -We. knew # he would be of
value to U3. ln work on the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers.; since our plans
had to be referred to the; river board of
engineers, .whose members were often far
scattered,- and he was in a position to iur
ther them. -.He declined to accept any sal
ary until Secretary of .WarAlger had aeut
him permission to serve. .
."Deputy Controller Douglas blocked our.
way from the first. He wrote to Secretary
Alicer on. his own account to aak \t Colonel
Heuer. could â¢ accept a salary ; from â¢ the
State while he was on the salary roll of
command in the west from
eral Clements, will collect the
Tenth Division on the Orange

The Morning Post's corre
spondent a,t Drietfontein, tele

I "The fight, throughout was
much involved. The enemy evac

subtly concealing their i inten

outranged ours, the naval brigade
not arriving in time. Our cav

Â¦pRAXKFORT, March U.â The first
more on. thÂ« part of Governor Beckham's
followers toward the formation of a
Btate guard under bis administration
was taken here to-day. City Clerk Ben
Marshall circulated a paper and enlisted
the requisite number of men who are to
compose a new company. The guns for
this company have been provided by dti
'tens here, most of them being either
fieedle guns or Winchesters.
This afternoon a report gained circula
tion that Governor Taylor had given his
soldiers orders to arrest Governor Beck
bam and other officers of the Democratic
State government. On account of this
report the men enlisted by Captain Mar
shall were assembled at the City Hall,
armed and sworn in as special, police for
the purpose of protecting the Democratic
officers who are still quartered at the
Capitol- Hotel. A large number of citizens
rolunteered and were assigned to various
posts in the vicinity of the hotel to offer
resistance in case the talked-of arrests
were attempted.
Governor Taylor's soldiers, who are on
gTJard at the State House, were reinforced
to-< Jay by the arrival of the Barberville
company of seventy-one men, all of whom
are fully armed and equipped. More
troops are looked for to-night. The Pine
vi;ie and London companies are expected
tome time during the night or to-morrow.
Governor Beckham this afternoon ap
pointed Colonel David R. Murray of
Clover Point assistant Adjutant General
wJth the rank of colonel and he was
iworn in. The official announcement was
made that this appointment was only
temporary. This was " regarded as sig
nificant, it being understood that Colonel
Murray accepted the appointment on ac
rount of the gravity of the present situa
tion and with the understanding that he
rould resign when the State became more
quiet.
Harland Whlttaker and "W. H. Culton,
â¢who were confined In Jail here charged
with complicity in the assassination of
Gocbel. were removed from the Jail at an
*Â«;>Â¦ hour this morning-and - taken^, to
Shelbyiille. where they were placed on a
train and s?nt to Louisville under a heavy
guard. It is understood they will be kept
in the Louisville Jail till the April term
of the Circuit Court, when they will be
returned here for trial.
LEXINGTON CALM AFTER
THE STRIFE OF SATURDAY
I^EXINGTOX. March 11.â The Sabbath
day brought a calm to the storm which
for three hours on Saturday night threat
ened to burst over Lexington. The adopt
ing- of a diFjrulse by Davis and Powers in
order to get oat of Frankfort puts an ugly
phase on the matter for the prisoners, in
the opinion of some of their friends here,
although they explain that they did so
merely to get away from the local Goebel
influences, Â¦which they allege would work
to their detriment In securing . a fair
trtaL 'V , -
Both tacitly admit now that In this
they may have made mistakes, as both
strongly urge their innocence of any con
nection with the murder of Goebel and
insist that they bayÂ« no fear whatever
as to the outcome.
Judge Denny, a prominent Republican
attorney, called on the prisoners to-day
and was closeted with them several hours.
He will represent them in whatever legal
eteps are taken. Both men are very calm
and have no further statement to make
than was given out last night.
Judge Denny said to-night that ~ the
prisoners were not averse to going to
Frankfort, but they would . like to . have
arrangements to try their cases here, but
th;s cannot be done except upon a writ
of habeas corpus, which is not likely to be
eougbt in this case.
Bheriq Suter of Franklin County came
here to-day and returned to-night to
Frankfort. He brought the warrants
with him that were issued in Franklin
County. The men were arrested last
night on warrants sworn to before Squire
Frank Graves of this city and returnable
before County Judge Bullock.
Sheriff Bosworth of this county says he
will give the men as speedy an examining
trial as they desire, but he does not think
it proper to have their trial for several
days yet on account of the excitement. "
Sheriff Suter stated that he did not
know when the men would be taken back
to Frankfort; not, however, until the ex
amining trial is over here, which will
simply decide that the local court has no
Jurisd'icUon. and the prisoners will then
bÂ« taken to Frankfort.
All Is quiet to-night, with soldiers still
guarding the Jail. The armory is deserted.
a* all arms are in the hands of the local
Eoltiiery on duty at the Jail. Colonel
Roger Williams of the Second Kentucky
Regiment has been wired to return from
Connorsville. but has not arrived. Cap
tain Ixingmire stated to-night that in case
Colonel Williams comes he will take no
orders from him. In this case there will
be a conflict of military authority, and if
Colonel Williams decide 3 to take the arm
cry he will have to do it by force. This
Is not likely to be pressed, as the prison
ers may be removed by the time Colonel
Williams returns.
Reports from sources high up in the
Beckham ranks are that Governor Beck
ham may move the State capital here,
but this is no more than a rumor.
Ocneral CasUeman is here to-night, but
he cays he has issued no orders and will
Issue none. He pays he will* do all in his
power to preserve the peace.
When "Colonel Roger Williams of the
Second Kentucky Regiment returns from
ronnorsville. Ind.. he will find a clash of
authority In his regiment which will be
difficult to reconcile. Captain Longmire,
under Beckham's orders, is in charge of
the guard about the Jail and the armory
nd its equipments. He said .to-night he
will not recognize any orders from Colonel
Williams. Captain Calhoun of Company
C of the local battalion will make a public
ttatement to-morrow that under Judge
Fields' decision he cannot do otherwise

thority. and will reÂ»ect any order from

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. Wash.. March 11.â At an
early hour this morning at Falling Springs
a terrible struggle took place between
Henry Williams and his wife and mother
in-law, whom he attempted to kill. Crazed
Â¦with drink, Williams broke into the house,
â¢which he set on fire in several places.
When the women awakened and tried to
put out the blaze Williams attempted to
t;hoot them, firing several shots, none of
which struck his intended victims. Then
he placed the muzzle of the revolver to
his own head and with his last cartridge
ended his life. Williams was 2S years old,
and separated from his young wife about
six months. He has been living at Pom
eroy, whiÂ£h is about five miles from Fall
ing Springs, the residence of his mother
in-law, Mrs. James Coleman. Since, the
peparation Mrs. Williams has been living
with her mother.
Yesterday she went to Pomeroy, where
Fhe met Williams for the first time since
the separation. The sight of her seemed
to madden him. He proceeded to fill up
on liquor, although he never drank before,
and to make threats against his wife and
her whole family.
At about 2 o'clock this morning Williams
appeared at Mrs. Coleman's house, where
he set fire to the outbuildings. Then
smashing in a window he entered the
house and proceeded to set it on fire in
several places. " -/ '
His wife was the flrst inmate of the
house to ai>peax. and he fired several shots
at her. She escaped injury. Jumped from
a pecend story -window to the ground and
went after help. Mrs. Coleman attempted
to extinguish the flames, when Williams
fired several shots at her. Then finding
his wife had escaped he stepped into a
closet and ended his life with a bullet
through his brain. Mrs. Coleman, aided
by neighbors who arrived shortly, was
able to put out the fire before great dam
ape had been done the house. Williams
had smashed nearly all the furniture,
broken the crockery and filled the walls
with bullet holes before his end.
EXAMINERS AND
COUGH AT OUTS
Corttinned from First Pare.
the Government. At the regular session
of the Legislature of 1899 the act to re
create the offlce of Commissioner of Public
Works was passed and approved by Gov
ernor Gage. The Controller's offlce pro
ceeded to dig up some irregularity in its
passage, and then referred the matter to
the Attorney General, who declared that
the law was invalid.- I have had the
opinion of many good lawyers thai the
alleged invalidity of the act, as regarded
the term of the Commissioners, did not
affect the auditing board nor any claims
contracted by its authority. But so the
Controller construed the opinion of the
Attorney General, and it was utilized to
hold up our claims for salaries. The
law as pa? fed by the Legislature of ISS9
Btands on the statute books to-day. No
court. Inferior or supreme, has declared it
Invalid; but on the strength of the opin
ion of the Attorney General the Control
ler's office has acted.
Douglas Explains.
"When Deputy Controller Douglas held
up those claims he asserted that he was
only enforcing the rules of that office to
pay no claims unless he had clear and
absolute warrant of law for so doing.
Now her<Â» Is evidence of his inconsistency.
He has not objected to the payment of
clearly outlawed claims presented by the
firm of which his brother, J. E. Douglas,
Js a membor. He could have applied the
Ftatute of limitations to them, since they
ran back twenty years, and compelled the
counties to seek relief at the hands of the
Legislature; but his brother and Pyburn
lece-lved a commission of 25 per cent on
their collections, and Douglas not only
presented no legal obstacle to the draw-
Ing of the warrants, but, I am Informed
by Joseph Gorman, former secretary of
the Board of Examiners, was constantly
before him to secure their approval and
transmission to the Controller's offlce.
"Colonel HeuÂ«r and I will now have to
wait for the next pesslon of the Legislature
before we can hope to recover pay for the
â¢work we have actually performed! To
bring: the matter up through the various
courts would take longer than to wait for
the Legislative session."
Status of the Case.
Thus the situation Btand3. The Control
ler's office will not draw the warrants in
favor of Nurse and Heuer. The Board of
Examiners will not allow the $200,000 worth
of back claims now before. It, on many of
which Pyburn & Douglas claim a 23 per
cent commission.. Friends of Nurse and
the Auditing Board say that the informa
tion as to the counties having back
claims, in the collection of which Pyburn
& Dougrlas have jrrown rich, could have
been obtainable only at the Controller's
offlce. Controller Colcan asserts that he
3s only acting within the law as laid down
for him by the Attorney General, and
There the matter rests.
The Contract.
The following Is a cops' of the contract
or ajrreement by which Pyburn & Doug-las
secured $2fi.Sfii 49 from the State for the
county of Yolo alone, for the collection of
which they received one-quarter the total
â¢sum;
It appears that there Is due this county from
the State money for the support of a*ed persons
In indigent circumstances, as shown by the
3aw approved March 15. ISBI. and â¢by a sub
sequent decision of the Supreme Court, which
allows to the several counties throughout the
State the same pro rata for the support of said
JndlKents, both in and out of the hcwpit&l and
also for th* support of orphans, half-orphans
etc.. as shown by the law approved March 25
38S0. . '
And it further apoearfnir that the claims for
thlÂ« county have jwver been properly orenared
c.nd presented to the State Do&rd of Exam
iner*, thereby securing: to the county every
dollar that Is due. we bee leave to present the
Icllrrwinr proposition:
WÂ« wljl compile, prpiwit and prosecute before
the eaid Board of Examiners the claims of thin
county ai-ainct the gtate for thÂ« support of
mch t>ertonÂ» for a contingent fee of 25 per
rent, and wÂ« further a*ree to present no claim
for Â«uch fee until naid claimii : have been al
lowed by the raid State Board of Examiners
and then only for the 25 per cent thereof. '

Pasadena Police Discover the Build

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, March 11.â The police have
discovered a robbers' nest that is like the

places that have not been cut up into'lots*
there stands an old. house which belongs
to the estate of J. 8. . Hurlbut and has
been unoccupied most of the time during
the past few years. Robert M. Catterson and
James Milk-son chose this place . for': the
storing of the plunder which they secured
in midnight raids. These raids have been
conducted during the past two months
and it is impossible to estimate how many
citizens have been victimized. The fa
vorite foraging of these human magpies
was the dwellings Â¦ of ' absent persons,
which In many cases had. been vacated in
a hurry and left stocked fully with furni
ture. Tablecloths, pillows, beds; â¢ buck
saws and shoes - and stockings were *e

distinction. . â¢Â¦ Â¦' â¢-â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The robbery -which resulted in ferreting

cured a wagon and broke -into th<i store
room of C. C. Thompson, a rancher. They
stole a ton of dried prunes and carted
them to Pomona, thlrtylodd miles away,
in the night.' The Constable at Pomona
was informed 'of the theft and arrested
Catterson. MlHeson had become .fright
ened and disappeared. The officers are still
looking for him. Catterson has been In
dicted on- two charges and has confessed
to robbing three stores and five dwelling

WATTS MURDER
Sheriff Johnson of Sacra

William Westlake.
Brouhard Recently Bargained for a

It to End His Own Life
With.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 11.â Sheriff
Johnson reported to-night fhat there have
been no developments In the investigation
Into- the murder of R. R. Watts on the
levee, Just beyond the northern limits of
the cjty. BMrs.8 Mrs. M. E. Brouhard, her di
vorced husband, Charles Brouhard, and
her clerk, George W. Odell, afe still con
fined In the County Jail on charges *of
murder, although with the evidence now
at hand it will not be possible to proceed
to an examination. â¢
There is little doubt that, as first an
nounced, in The Call, Watts was murder
ed because of his threat to appear as a
witness in the case against Mrs. Brou
hard .in San Francisco. But it is not so
easy to fasten the crime on the guilty
party or parties. Sheriff Johnson has been
indefatigable in his endeavors to run down
every clew, and he has by no means given
tip hope of final success. He is now look
ing for a man named William Westlake,
who is belived to know something about
the crime and in whose room were found
Â«"ome of Watts' effects. Brouhard himself
has been furnishing all the sensa
tionalism. â¢ ,
It now develops that about two weeks
ago he entered Isldor Cohen's cigar store,
near Fourth and I streets, and bargained
for a revolver, which, however, was held
at too high a figure for his purse. Brou
hard admits the circumstance and says he
wanted to buy the pistol to enable him
to commit suicide. Whether such was his
purpose or whether he-wanted the pistol
to murder Watts with Is at present a
matter of conjecture, but Brouhard has
done enough suspicious things to supply a
plot for a melodramatic villain. Mrs.
Brouhard, by the way. declines to talk.

the \ Banning Dis-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, March 11.âFur
ther, investigations Into the case of James
McHaney, - formerly owner of the Desert.
Que^n, mine, give evidence of one of the
strangest counterfeiting schemes ever un
earthed in the- State. In addition to the
coin found. yesterday morning, leading to
the arrest of McHaney, ' inquiry brings' to
light several gold counterfeit coins passed
by him recently, and merchants recall the
time when; McHaney^ ram the -Klondike
saloon a large number of counterfeit dol
lars were- traced to it.
The" United States officers, 'from Los
Angeles arc here following up clews>and
finding plenty of them. It Is supposed
that Hildebrand, who has served a term
for; counterfeiting and who Is now here,
is connected with the case, as he Is an ex
pert counterfeiter; but/although he has
been shadowed;, no evidence against him
has been secured. Manuel Diaz, a Mexi
can, has been arrested as one of the gang
andplaced in jail awaiting developments.
The officers are trying to locate the mint,
bufso. far think it Is across the Mexican
border. ;The coin is made of babbitt metal
and plated over with a battery. ; It was
supposed | that . McHaney, I who has been
making frequent trips to the Desert Queen
mine, stepped from there. across the bor
der when he wanted to stock up.
This, belief was shaken by, the arrival
late last night of Horace Muscott, forest
ranger for the Bannir" District. While
out yesterday near Whitewater 'he came
suddenly upon the camp . of William ) Mc-
Haney, brother 'of the accused and -also
one of the pr6prletors of the Desert Queen
mine. â¢;â¢ William and his nephew seemed to
be, the only occupants of the camp, but
there were Winchesters In profusion, and
the men kept close to Muscott and tried
to get- behind" him, evidently with evil in
tentions,', but he ! turned ! off . his visit as
merely one necessary as a ranger looking
for. camp-fires, and after, a few. questions
made his escape. â¢ . Neither, he nor William
McHaney, had then heard of the arrest of
James, but the camp > was so suspicious
that ' Muscott ' came ; to i town â¢ as ; soon as
possible and told -his story. The officers
think this is the counterfeiters' camp," and
a large posse went back to-day under the
lead of Muscott to bring in William iJc-
Haney*and his nephew, with _ orders -to
take, them dead or alive. Their return is
anxiously awaited. â¢ Â¦ - :
James 'McHaney takes his arrest coolly,
and states that the bogus coins were given
him in change at Redlands and again that
he got them at a saloon here In town. It
Is evident that the officers are on the trail
of a large gang of counterfeiters, and will
probably, bag the game.- -'

REPUBLICANS
FAIL TO REACH
A COMPROMISE
Still No Agreement Over the
Porto Rican Tariff
Senator Foraker Unwilling to Go Any
Further Than to Admit! Food
Products Free to the
Island.
Special Dif patch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. March 11.
V-Al}'attempts. to, unite the Republicans of
the ' Senate on a compromise relative to
the Porto Rlcan bill have thus far failed.
Senator Aldrich and other members of
the steering: committee are trying to bring
about. an agreement, but Senator Foraker
is still unwilling to go any further than
to accept an amendment allowing all food
products to be imported into Porto Rico
from the United States free of duty. He
Is not Inclined to yield the management
of his bill to the steering committee. He
thinks that when he and his committee
have decided upon a measure as proper
they. ought not to yield their Judgment to
Senators who have not given the matter
the same amount of consideration.
Senator Aldrich is . still hopeful that
some compromise may be reached and he
Is anxious to bring it about if possible,
before he leaves for Cuba about tne mid
dle of the week.
The j)lan of -compromise advocated by
some Senators is to have the pending bill
amended by cutting the tariff feature en
tirely loose from the general Government
bill and attaching It to the Porto Ridan
relief apropriatlon bill, so amneded as to
permit all imports from the United States
into Porto Rico free of duty and to re
duce the duty on Porto Rlcan goods im
ported into the United States below the
proposed 15 per cent of the Dingley tariff.
This, it is contended, would still preserve
the principle at the bottom of the pend
ing bill and would enable a test case to
be made before the Supreme Court to
determine the question as to the power of
Congress to impose duties on commerce
between the United States and insular
possessions. *
One of the arguments against accepting
this proposition is that it would weaken
the contention- so strenuously made by
Republicans in the House that a tariff Is
needed to supply the revenue for the In
sular government. It Is pointed out that
ifl no duty whatever should be collected
at the Porto Rlcan end, and if the rate
at the United States end should be re
duced below 15 per. cent, the bill would
yield so little revenue as to make It of
very little benefit to the treasury of Porto
Rico.

ADVERTISEMENTS.IMPERIALISM
AS DANGEROUS
AS SECESSION
Thus Declares Dr. Jordan
in Discussing the New
Policy.
Ex-President Harrison Among Those
Who Applaud the Remarks
of the President of Stan
ford University.
Â«
Special IMs'patch to The Call.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, March 11.â David
Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stan
ford University, has started some vigorous
thinking in the Central States. It is due
to his lecture last night at Indianapolis
before the school-teachers at the Univer
sity Club on "Lessons from the Trans
vaal." Ex-President Harrison was among
those who welcomed him. President Jor
dan said the most dangerous and subver
sive theory since that of secession was
that of American imperialism, exemplified
in the taxation of trade with Porto Rico.
It would be repudiated by the American
people, as it ought to be. If we. were to
retain our new possessions as part of the
I'nited States the constitution gave us all
the ranee an honest Congress needed In j
managing them. They must take care of |
themselves, as the rest of us did, for the
word "sovereignty" was unknown to
American law.
"The time has come.." he continued, "to
decide whether what we want Is expan
sion, extension of American institutions
or holding these inferior nations as in- |
ferlor nations for our own benefit and.
Incidentally, for their own good. There
is oniy one answer to that question, and
tnat is: Expansion Is impossible under
our constitution. Wherever our flag
goes to stay there our constitution goes
to stay. There never can be two kinds of
citizens under our flagâ a regular citi
zen and a three-quarter citizen. The de
sire to add the Philippines to the United
States is based on ignorance of what the
Philippines really are and what we will
ultimately do with them.
Bad Policy but Good Morals.
"To admit Luzon and Mindanao as
States micht be bad policy, but would
not be bad morals. The constitution pro
vided that Import duties shall be equal
throughout the United States. There
shall be none between States. Therefore
any tax levied on Porto Rico provides that
It is not part of the United States. If it
is not part of the United States it is not
under the constitution, hence it is not
under the dominion of the President and
Congress, who are creatures of the con
stitution. Congress cannot do other than
extend the general tariff law to any part
of the United States. To suppose that
Congress can go where the constitution
cannot and yet be a creature under the
constitution is an idea unthinkable.
"When the country of Hawaii disap
peared its people became citizens of the
United States with all the rights and pre
rogatives of our own citizens, including
the right of tariff protection and of free
trade enjoyed by other citizens of the
Union. Congress cannot extend the con
stitution to any place that the constitu
tion does not legally cover. There is no
warrant In the constitution or good
morals for the terms. of possession and
Fovereignty as distinguished from equal
right and ordinary citizenship. It is bad
enough to make negroes and Malays equal
citizens of the United States: to make
them vassals would be infinitely worse.
The tropical economical system which Is
rapidly ruining Great Britain cannot be
fastened on the people of the United
States."
England Guilty of Murder.
In his reference to Transvaal affairs
President Jordan said the forcing of war
upon those people by the British was a
deliberate murder, and the responsibility
of the crime rests upon Chamberlain Â«md,
incidentally, Cecil Rhodes, who, although
undoubtedly a great man. Is utterly devoid
of conscience. While none of us want to
see England actually whipped, there are
many of us who would like to see a good
sized knot tied on the tail of the British
lion Further along President Jorfl.in
said:
"The great Irsson of the Transvaal will
be learned later on. Imperialism, militar
ism, greed, will never strengthen England
permanently. ThÂ« only strength a nation
has is In the hearts of Its people, and that
is what makes the United States as a no
tion what It Is to-day.- Imperialism Is the
slavery of nations. Not until 'Uncle Tom's
Cabin' was written did the people of the
United States realize what the slavery of
men really meant. Some day soineH&^.v
v.iil write the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of Bilt
ish Imperialism, ard it will create a grcar
r-r stir than did the book of Harriet
1 Bcecher Rtowe. Great Britain Is Â»n the
! wrong. The Anglo-Saxon has a mission to
perform. Its influence should be felt In
every nation, its sword In none."
Ex-President Harrison was among those
who applauded Dr. Jordan's- assault upon
Imperialism. i -

AMERICAN CONTROL OF
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL
Captain Mahan Urges an Increase in
the Navy to Back Up the Mon
roe Doctrine.
NEW YORK. March 11.â In a paper on
"The Monroe Doctrine and Our Navy,"
which he has written for the forthcoming
issue of Leslie's Weekly, Captain A- T.
Mahan says:
Â¦\Ve must remember that other nations, and
especially Europeanâ because the *nost active â
are interested likewise . In using the isthmian
canal and, for the support of their Interests,
in talninc -positions. To their doinz so we
oppose the Monroe doctrine.
The navy should strictly be superior to any
which can be broueht aealnst )t, hut this tx
treme conclusion Is qualified by "thY circum
stances, such as our nearness to the Caribbean
Pea. our national power throuch our irreat le
sources, the daneerg to which oar possible op
ponents may be exposed In othor quarters anJ
from other enemies. We cannot la the near
future expect to have a navy nearly as iars"
as that which Great Britain must keep, but It
is easily within our means to rival that of
France "or Germany, the only Kun/pean Males
other than Great Britain whose general inter
ests mlKht lead them actively to dispute the
maintenance of the Monroe doctrine.
Reflection upon this condition will Indicate
the size nrcessary to our own war fleet and
aluo the wisdom of cultivating those cordial
relations to which Great Britain has Invited
us. which our Interests and our Institutions
advise and the existence of which put It out
of t^e power or wish of any other state to
quarrel with us about the Monroe doctrine. It
Id to the interest of Great Britain that we
should take naval charge of the American Isth
mus, provided she can feel' sure that we will
do It effectively or that our preparations and
our deeds will answer to the words oJ Wash
ineton and Monroe.
RAILROADS AGREE TO
STOP CUTTING OF RATES
Practically an Alliance Formed for
Protection Against the Inter
state Commerce Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 11.â It Is rumored
that the great Western railroads have
made an agreement to do no more cutting
of rates between Chicago and the western
coast. The agreement. It Is reported on
excellent authority, practically amounts
to an alliance of these railroads for mu
tual protection against the interstate com
merce law.
According to the Herald's informant, at
a meeting of representatives of all or
most of the continental lines, which
took place here on March 8. an agreement
was made that after March 15 there would
be absolutely no cutting of rates west of
Chicago and to the Pacific Coast. .
Among the roads said to have been rep
resented at the conference were the Chi
cago. Burlington and .Qunicy Railroad.
Southern Pacific. Central Pacific, North
ern Pacific. Atchlson. Topeka and Santa
Fe and Chicago and Northwestern roads.
In fact, it is said that every important
line between Chicago and the Pacific
coast, with the exception of the Canadian
roads, entered into the compact.
Neither Cook nor Raymond or any tour
ists* companies which hitherto have had
special rates will, it Is asserted, receive
any advantage under the new arrange
ment. V^:-'.

Special Dispatch to Tie Call.
TOPEKA. Kans.. March ILâ An un
usually large number of people attended
K<jv. Charles M. Sheldon's church to-day.
It was expected he would say something
in regard to the experiment of editing a
Christian daily newspaper next week, but
In this the congregation was disappointed.
He made no reference to the matter what
ever. The subject of his discourse was
"Discontent." His text was taken from
the seventeenth pealm, fifteenth verse:
"As for me, I will behold thy face In
righteousness; I phall be satisned when I
awake with thy likeness."
The giet of the sermon was to the effect
that discontent exists only with the un
saved and unrighteous. The true Chris
xian, he said. Is contented under almost
any circumstances. The sermon was a
disappointment. It was not up to Mr.
Sheldon's usual standard. He appeared
"worn out. and the sermon Itself showed
lack of caxef ul preparation. â¢ During the
past week Mr. Sheldon has been spending
co much time in the Capital office that
his sermon suffered from neglect. Mr.
Sheldon did not preach To-night. Services
oonslsted in Bible readings, music, etc.
It leaked out to-day that Mr. Sheldon
Tcfused to advertise railroads. Asked
about the matter, the management of the
Capital to-night confirmed the report. Mr.
Sheldon assigned eeveral reasons for re
fusing this class of advertisements. He
Is a socialist and believes that railroads
should not be advertised any more than
public highways should. Another reason
Jor his refusal is the fact that railroads
compel employes to work on Sunday,
fsheldon bitterly opposed any kind of
work being done on Sunday. He believes
railroads should suspend business on Sun
day and aJI trains come to a standstill at
midnight Saturday night or before that
time in cases where stops would be more
Rev. Mr. Sheldon's instructions to the.
telegraph editor of the Capital for next
Â¦week are to the effect that all telegraph
news as It comes off the wire must first
be submitted to him. After he has -kill
ed" the portions of it lie desires he will
turn the copy over to the telegraph editor,
Â¦who will edit and write heads. Then asrain
must the matter be submitted to Sheldon
ff>r approval. A similar system will be
followed in the local rooms. Mr. Sheldon
will instruct the reporters in advance how
he wants each Ftory handled.
Mr. Sheldon has ordered the employes
of the Capital to abstain from the use of
tobacco or liquor in any form. This
morning when "30" (signifying that no
more matter is to be received* went in and
the forms were ready for the press the
entire editorial and report orial force held
a meeting sr.d resolved to quit the tobacco
habit and to abstain from the use of al
cnholiu liquors in future. Mr. Sheldon 1*
greatly pleased with this reform.

BIG DONATION FOR
THE FRENCH HOSPITAL
Meeting at Native Sons' Hall
Preparatory to the Society ?s
Regular Annual Election.
The French Benevolent Society, of
which the French Hospital is an ad
junct, met yesterday afternoon at Native
Sons' Hall preparatory to the annual
meeting for the election of officers, which
is set for March 25.
Secretary A. Labigne read extracts
from his annual report, the most im
port Item of which is the announcement
of the settlement of the A. E. Sabatle
estate. This will bring no less than $102,
000 into the treasury of the society to be
devoted to the needs of the hospital.
Upon the conclusion of the reading of
the secretary's report many were the
eulogies pronounced upon the deceased
Sabatie. A. Goustlaux spoke at length on
the liberality and charity of M. Sabatle
in the most glowing terms. It was sug
gested by P. A. Bergerot that the gift to
the society be commemorated by the ex
penditure of $1000 for a bust of M. Sabatie
to be erected in the hospital. Dr. Oscar
Maver an honorary member of the Insti
tution, proposed that the endowment go
toward the fitting up of a new operating
room, at the. entrance of which the bust
should be placed.
The following directors were placed in
nomination: A. Messager, F. Cediez, R.
M Agulrre, F. St. Denis. A. Miqueu. H.
Falregue, D. Cames. John Burgess and
Emanuel Meyer. James Godeaux will
be judge of election.
CONTINUE THE AGITATION
AGAINST MGR. SBARRETTI
MfÂ«ting of Havana Citizens to Pro- j
test His Appointment to the
Bishopric.
HAVANA. March 11.â Comparatively
few people attended to-day's meeting to
protest against the appointment of Mgr.
Sbarretti to tho bishopric of Havana. A
committee of four, including General
Maximo Gomez, was appointed to visit
the hiFhop a.r.d inform him respectfully of
the wi.<=hes of the Cuban people. It was
argued that it would be better to take
course <in the chance that Mgr.
Ftiarretti would express a willingness to
resign, and thus to save the work of
organizing some forty sub-committees
Â«>f protest from the various parts of the
tUocese. as was originally proposed.
A resolution was offered advocating that
a protest be sent direct to the Pope and
that nothing further be done till his
answer had been received, but this was
negatived by a large majority. It being
argued that the movement might grow
coid were the agitation to be dropped for
cix weeks, the time it was estimated
would be required to get a reply from
Home.
A representative of the popular com
mittee of protest, who was present, said
peceral manifestations in opposition to
the appointment were about to be made in
the provinces of Matanzas and Santa
Clara on the day after the landing of
Mgr. Sbarreiti. but that the letter which
General Gomez published in the Havana
papers was telegraphed to many towns
and had the effect of deterring the intend
ing demonstrations.

as he led the last of the dripping proces
sion from the font to a pew. An ambu
lance was summoned from the Roosevelt
Hospital and three old colored women
who had fainted because of the shock of
Immersion, combined with the poor venti
lation of the church, were carried to their

culmination of a series of revivals In this

prised the Crew of the Wrecked

that the British steamer Cuvier,.com
manded by Captain Quinton, which was
reported Friday last sunk by an unknown
steamer, v/as run down In the Straits of

steamer whose Identity Is not known. The
three survivors who were landed at
Calais, France, shortly after the disaster
say a great hole was torn in the Cuvier,
sinking her in leas than five â¢ minutes.
They further state that the thirty men
comprising the crew . were below at the
time of the collision and were unable to
reach the decks and man the boats, so
quickly did the rammed vessel go' down,
and that the colliding vessel paid no heed
to the cries for assistance shouted to those
on board and steamed away.
The captain and third mate were seen
to jump from the. bridge as their vessel
went down. Two of the survivors clung
to a capsized boat until picked up by the
Windsor and taken to Calais. It is be
lieved all the other members of the crew
of the Cuvier are drowned.

TAYLOR PARDONS ALL
OF THE ACCUSED MEN
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. March 11.âAccord
ing" to a statement made by Governor
Taylor to-night to a representative of tho
Commercial, he has granted a pardon to
each of the persons- for whom warrants
have been issued charging them with be
ing accessories to the assassination of
Governor Goebel, Including Secretary of
State Caleb Powers and ex-Secretary of
State Finlcy. In his statement Gov
ernor Taylor recites the conditions un
der which he claims to have been elected
and charges the Democratic contestants
for State offices with conspiracy to secure
control of the government. He con
tinues:
Notwithstanding these conspirators * ere de
feated at the polls as to the State officers, they
succeeded in securing a majority in each of the
two houses of the General Assembly and in re
taining in power the State canvasslnc and
countmz machine.
While many Democratic members were hon
estly elected, yet others were elected by the
manipulation. of dishonest j.reclnct officers and
County Canvassing Boards before and during
the election, and then after the election by a
syÃtem of countlnÃ in and counting: out until
the majority aforesaid was obtained. As thus
constituted, the General Assembly and Un
vas-slne Hoard have declared that the will of
the people, as expressed at the polls, shall be
net aside. It Is needless to cay that such con
splracres as this almost inevitably* produce
revolution, because a free people will not wlll
lncly be deprived of their right of suflraKe or
concent that the minority Instead of the ma
jority shall rule.
Pending this unfortunate struggle, the Hon.
William Goebel, the contestant for the office of
Governor, was assassinated by some person
whose Identity Is unknown. Thereupon a con- .
splracy was formed to fasten this heinous
crime upon all or some of the State officers
elected by the people, the purpose being to ob
scure and cover the political, robbery and to
terrorize and destroy all opposition. In order
to carry out this foul conspiracy they procured
an act appropriating JIOO.COO. ostensibly for the
purpose of detecting the criminals, and em
ployed a lawyer whose course in the criminal
practice in Cincinnati was so odious as to cause
a riot, resulting in the destruction of the Court
house and the loss of over forty lives.
Following this, an employe of the Cincinnati
Enquirer has made ' affidavits charging that
Hon. Caleb Powers, Secretary of State: his
brother. John Powers, a captain of a company
of State militia: W. H. Coulton, a clerk in the
Auditor's office; Hon. Charles Flniey. ex-Sec
retary of State, and Captain John w; Davis,
policeman of the Statehouse grounds, con
spired, aided and abetted in said assassination.
Wurrants were issued and said W. H. Coulton
was, during the night of March 9, taken from
his home, where his wife and children were
sick, and Incarcerated In the County Jail, with
out ball or being Biven an opportunity to secure
ball On the day of said assassination Har
land" Whittaker, wMose residence Is In Butler
County Ky . was arrested and charged with
said crime and assassination and was placed
In Jail and kept confined without trial for over
one month, in defiance* of law requiring a
speedy examination and that a person charged
with crime shall be brought out every two days.
UjÂ«jn the trial he was held over without bail,
notwithstanding" there was absolutely no evi
dence "introduced showing his guilt. For some
cjiuse or without cause, our courts, composed
almost entirely of Democratic Judges have be
come so partisan that it is practically, if not
absolutely. Impossible for any man not of their
persuasion to obtain a fair trial. As organized,
the courts are courts of conviction instead of
CO Under Ot thlt'Wte of affairs, believing that
each one of said persons is Innocent of any
complicity in said crime, and further believing
tho t the "enormous reward will secure (he- con
viction of these men. however innocent, I
deemed it my solemn duty to Issue pardons to
them in order that these political conspirators
might not be enabled to deprive them of their
liberty or life. The guilty men should be pun
ished but designing men controlling the courts
should not be enabled to shed blood of Innocent
men- and If it is In my power to prevent it I
pledge myself, in the name of God and human
ity, that It shall not be done.
ACCUSED MEN ARE
TAKEN TO LOUISVILLE
LOUISVILLE. K>\. March 11.â An officer
from Frankfort arrived here to-night
about 8:30 having in custody ' Hariaml
Whittaker, who at his preliminary trial
a few days ago was held .to the Grand
Jury on the charge of complicity In tho
assassination of Governor Goebel, and W
H Coulton. who was arrested yesterday
on a -similar charge. The men were
brought here from Frankfort because of
the fear that an attempt would be made
by the soldiers, acting under the Republi
can administration, to liberate them.
MULTITUDES HEAR
THE BOY PREACHER
Three Services Held at Howard-Street
Church and Many Converts
Are Made.
Devout Christians and scoffing Infidels,
the lame, the halt and the. blind, profes
sional men, laborers, the unemployed
and women of all ages and from every
walk of life crowded Howard-street
M. E. Church from door to pulpit at
three different services held yesterday at
which Master Jack Cooke, the boy evan
gelist, officiated. This youth is attract
ing unusual attention. Many believe that
he is as he says, filled with the spirit
of the Holy Ghost, while others believe
that he is what he appears to be, a boy
of considerable learning in his chosen line
and endowed only with the right to
preach If so inclined, a right denied to no
one under the laws of this land. .
The services conducted yesterday were
on the same lines as those that enter
tained the congregation during all of last
week. The boy preacher preached, an
swered questions to the best of his abil
ity and exhorted his hearers to follow the
teachings of scripture. An experience
meeting followed. In which many told of
the sins they had committed in the past
and prayed that henceforth their feet
would always tread the straight and nar
row path. During the day it was found
necessary to remove one of the audience
for his annoying conduct. Another was
denied admittance to church for having
created a disturbance during a prior meet-
Ing These were the only Incidents that
tended to disturb the various meetings.
At the close of each meeting many people
went to the altar and confessed the sins
of their lives. Prayer was offered for
them and- they prayed with those who
had converted them. It was late in the
evening before the last service concluded.
EASTERN ATHLETES TO
BE WELL ENTERTAINED
The Eastern champion athletes who did
such brilliant work In the boxing and
wrestling tournament last week in the
Olympic Athletic Club arena will be tha
recipients of marked attention during the
week to come. They will start eastward
next Monday. In the meantime they will
be lavishly entertained at theater parties
and In sightseeing, being shown all points
of interest in and about this city.
They all express surprise at the hospi
tality shown them by the directorate oC
the Olympic Club, as it has, apparently,
been boundless. When the young men
left the East they were warned against
Western spectators and the referees by
whom their performances were to ba
passed upon. They have had no reason
to feel unkindly toward the referees. Jack
Kitchen and Eugene Van Court, both of
whom dealt out exact justice. The spec
tators have fairly idolized the visitors and
have accorted them the most kindly and,
enthusiastic receptions at every available
opportunity.
The work of the visitors has revived
wrestling and has also placed amateur
boxing on a higher plane. It is possible
the Olympic Club officials will make the*
tournament an annual event working in
conjunction with the officials of the Ama
teur Athletic Union in the East. Presi
dent William Greer Harrison. J. A. Ham
mersmith, John Elliott and their asso
ciates on the Olympic directorate worked
hard and earnestly for the success of the
tournament, in the brilliant outcome of
which they find their recompense.
The athletes are to be the guests of the
Orpheum management tnls evening. When
they first arrived John Morrisey, man
ager of the Orpheum. sent an invitation
tendering them the freedom of the house,
but the cares of training caused them to
postpone an acceptance until their work
In ring and on mat was over.
Boxes have been set aside for the visit
ors, and John Morrisey has promised to
see that they remember their visit to tha
Orpheum with genuine pleasure.

CHRISTIAN CHURCH TO
INCREASE ITS POWER
Meeting of the Angelical Board at
Â¦ Which Ways and Means Were
Discussed.- :
First Christian Church. Twelfth street,
near Howard, was last evenirig the scene
of an earnest meeting, held to devise ways
and means for the furtherance of . the
interests of- the church and to provide for
the establishment iot other churches of
the sect throughout the ctly. Judge E.
A. Bridgford, chairman of the angelical
board. , presided at . the . meeting and was
assisted by Dean S. M. Jefferson of Berk
eley, Rev. Mr. Hathaway of Alameda.
Rev. G. Smith .of Oakland. Rev. W.
White of the West Side Church and Rev.
Frank S. Ford of the First Christian
Church. . . - â¢â¢ -
-"These five churches constitute the
strength of the Christian church in the
bay cities." said Judge Bridgford. "The
purpose of this meeting is: to enlist the
aid of all in the church to join hands and
aid 'us- to gain greater strength-through
out the land. The board of which I am the
chairman was not organized for spasmodic
effort, but for methodical and permanent
labor on behalf of .the church. A few
years ago there were but five churches of
our denomination in . Chicago. To-day
there are twenty-one and the church la
still forging ahead. We are here to
night to enlist you in the ranks of the
workers and provide you with the muni
tions , of war,. for we. are going to lay
siege Â¦to the city. In unity there is
strength and- with proper organization
much can be done."
- In all probability Rev. A. W. Darst of
i Chicago will come to this city and aid in
the fight of the church to enlarge Its
scope. All the ministers present spoke of
the hope, they placed in the new move
ment to advance the interests of the
church : and believed that a few years
hence would see the cljurch as thorough
ly established and as strong as it is to
day in Chicago and other portions of the
East. Several meetings will be held in
the course of the next few weeks to com-
I plete the plan already under preparation
I for the establishment of other churches
throughout the bay cities.
YAQUI BRAVES
SLAUGHTERED BY
THE MEXICANS
Four Days of Skirmishing
Brings Disaster to'the
Indians. â¢ :
Mayas Have Also Taken the War
path and Bands '. of Them Are '
Continually Harassing the
Mexican Troops. 1
AUSTIN. Texas, March 11.â A specir.l
from Potam, Mexico, says that during the
four days ending on Friday the Yaqui In
dians and â¢ the Mexican troops had four
engagements near Cocorlto, Mexico. The
Mexican troops are endeavoring to force
their way Â¦ through this section of the
country so as to keep a roadway between
Torin and that point open for travel.
There are a great' many Indians known
to be in this immediate section, and it is
evident that a very strong force will have
to be in the field at once to suppress the
uprising. The> engagements of the four
days mentioned very disastrously
for the Indians, as in the neighborhood of
200 are known to have been killed, and
possibly more. The Mexican troops.suf
fered very little loss of life, though some
twenty soldiers were wounded.- â¢ -
All the engagements were in the nature
of skirmishes, lasting only a few hours,
when the Indians would retire. The fact
that the Maya Indians have also taken the
warpath arid are harassing the troops a
great deal gives rise to grave surmises as
to how long it will take to bring the up
rising to a termination.
A special- from Ortiz. State of Sonota,
is â¢to the effect that on Friday , reporcs
reached there of a bloody skirmish be
tween a band of some SOO Yaquls-anl
about an equal number of soldiers about
fifty miles west of that palce. in which the
fighting was continued all day. The. loss
among the soldiers was light owing to
their splendid fortifications, behind a nat
ural breastwork of bowlders on a hillside,
with the Indians in the open. It was a
cleverly laid trap Into which the Indians
were led, and while they left none of their
dead on the field it is thought their loss is
heavy, as quite a'number were seen o
fall. Reliable information states that
fully 2500 Yaquis are now in the neighbor
hood of Guaymas. and fully as many more
are prowling between Medano and Potam.

resentatives of the Ottawa Government were, at Daw
son they defended the regulations; by the argument
that the" mines arc worked chiefly by aliens, who
carry United States goods into the 'country, instead of
buying Canadian goods; and who' take the gold away
to' the United States to spend. Commenting upon
such arguments,: one speaker said: "This country
has to be opened up, and # it has to be opened up
by people "who are willing to come and do the work.
That's all there is to that. Canada has no welcome
for the Chinaman. For every white man it has. If
anybody says otherwise or talks of legislation based
on hostility to aliens it is the voice of ignorance and
nothing more." Another added: "I venture to say
that" England will ultimately get her share of the
earth's new gold, wherever it may be dug. Just, as
soon as the authorities see that this country has be
come non-producing they will change their method.
So long as it was rich and juicy they would squeeze it
for all they knew how."
From all this it appears that Dawson is rapidly ap
proaching bedrock and will soon find out whether
upon that rock it be possible to build a permanent
prosperity. There is no longer any desire to shut out
aliens or even to put any restrictions upon their work.
Dawson, in fact, has ceased to be proud, and the Ot
tawa Government will have to repeal its stringent
regulations, or else it will kill the golden goose.

AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
ONE of the series of our Home Circle Studies
for the spring season, most generally interest
ing to all classes of readers, is that dealing
with the history of American political parties. The
course, which has been arranged under the direction
of Jesse Macy, LL. D., professor of political science
of lowa College, is designed primarily for young vot
ers and for the Presidential year, with a view of di
recting intelligent political study and discussion, it
is therefore one which appeals to all who take an in
terest in public questions and the history of the
republic.
The full course is to contain sixteen papers, cover
ing the principal topics of American party history
from the days of the Federalists down to the cam
paign of iB6O. Among other interesting articles will
be accounts of 'the rise and decline of the Whig
party, the origin of the Republican party, the organ
ization of parties on sectional lines, and of the various
minor parties that existed before the war. Not the
least interesting and instructive will be those giving
account of the origin and development of national
nominating machinery, the national convention and
the fully organized party machine.
For the general reader tliere can be no better intro
duction to the campaign of this year than these stud
ies, which embrace an outline of the whole party his
tory of the republic. While prepared mainly .'for the
instruction of young voters, they merit the attention
of all, for they will throw much light upon interesting
periods and events of our national development.

SOME CONDITIONS AT DAWSON.
1 ; ROM the Dawson Weekly News of Febru-
I ary 16 it is learned that the people of that sec
..*: r : Â¦â¢Â¦'-â¢' tion of the Klondike country have obtained at
last something like a fairly good winter mail service;
but, on the other hand, the gold diggings on the
near creeks have been about exhausted, and the
"prominent citizens" of Dawson are trying to in
duce the Canadian Government to make more
liberal terms, not only for Canadians but for out
side miners, so that the region may not be aban
doned and Dawson itself become hardly more than a
way station on the river.
Concerning the mail service, the News announces
that the mail just before the date of publication had
brought to the city a considerable amount of second
class mail, on which there hadbeen paid only second
class postage. As in the past the mails have not de
livered papers or magazines, even though first-class
postage was paid on them, the new order of things is
highly gratifying to the community, and the News
says: "People of the Yukon have been so hungry for
their 'home paper' and the current magazines that the
matter of postage did not figure, they having grown
accustomed to paying extra prices for everything.
But they did chafe upon not receiving the goods, the
price being paid. Now it looks as though the em
bargo had been lifted. The second-class mail is not
only coming, but at second-class rates; so that the
friend on the outside who may do the mailing of these
things may be encouraged to do more."
The information concerning the conditions of the
mines occurs in a report of the proceedings at a meet
ing of the Board of Trade which, we are told, was
well attended by representative miners, "large holders
and operators who follow no other vocation." The
object of the meeting was to provide some means of
adapting the mining industry to the changed condi
tions of th,e, district and to induce the Government to
relax some of its restrictions. _
One of the .speakers at the meeting is quoted as say
ing: "El" Dorado has been practically worked out,
and large parts of Bonanza. We must secure an ad
justment of these regulations to the new conditions.
For the future the camp must lay its chief dependence
on creeks farther away, and therefore still more ex
pensive to. work, while they are not so rich. We
must : make recommendations now looking to the
very " existence of the camp. ' With regulations in
keeping with the conditions â I mean such as shall
encourage the prospecting of ground and the develop
ment of mines â I am* assured that large owners here
would put not hundreds but thousands of men to
work, and the' dying camp would be revived." His
motion was that* a recommendation be made that the
royalty be wholly abolished, but that if a royalty was
still insisted upon it would be placed on the net prod
uct and not on the gross. '
Other speakers referred to the restrictions put upon
slicn miners, and one of them reported that when rep-

THE COUNTRY'S MARKETS.
REPORTS from trade centers last week were
rather conflicting. One commercial author
ity reported some increase in business, due
to clearer weather in the Eastern and Western
States, with a firm tendency in prices for most
lines of goods, while another authorit}-, equally
reliable, reported a general slackening, with weak
ness apparent all along the line, though the great
corporations were stubbornly holding up quota
tions. The statistics rather supported the latter view
of the situation, as the bank clearings showed a fall
irg off of 1 1.5 per cent from last year, and the failures
were 205, against 182.
As a matter of fact, spring trade is not up to expec
tations. There is a halt all along the Hue. It is not
en account of tight money, for money is reported easy
everywhere except in Wall street, where the new
financial bill has naturally created a little hardness in
funds, though it is so slight as hardly to merit remark.
The reason for the halt has been given several times.
It is that the enormous demand for goods of all sorts
â¢which characterized business last year has been satis
fied, and consumption has finally caught up with pro
duction. This is the situation in a nutshell.
If the natural law *5f trade be allowed to take its
course there will be no trouble and the halt will be
comparativey temporary. If manufacturers and pro
ducers will adapt their output to the legitimate de
mands of the public the present healthy condition of
trade will continue indefinitely; but if goods are
t::rr.ed out on speculation, without regard to the cur
rent needs of the country, overstocked markets and
d:il! times will surely result. The former course will
probably be pursued, for the financial storm that bc
pan in 1893 and lasted five years was followed by pros
perity too brief to turn the mercantile head. The les
sons of that famous panic are still fresh in the com
iriercial memory, and no sane man wishes them re
peated. Nor, judging from present indications, will
they be. Speculation is at a low ebb all over the
country, and business men are confining their opera
tions to the legitimate wants of the markets. As long
as this lire of conduct is followed times cannot be
very hard, though they may be dull.
-As for the staples, leather is firm, but hides areftull
and still weaker in most markets. Orders for boots
and shoes are remarkably small. Wool is weaker,
owing to a severe decline at the opening sales in
London. â¢ Wheat has sagged again, and seems to have
r,o friends. Corn, on the contrary, has been enor
mously active. Cotton has touched the highest point
for years, but there are signs of a reaction. Stocks of
iion are reported somewhat larger, though the pro
duction fell off in February. A redeeming feature in
this trade is the advancing tendency in wages. Lum
ber is quoted firm, except in those cities where strikes
2rc under way or threatened. . :
Locally the situation stands about the same. A
week's rain all over the central and northern parts of
the State has further gilded the crop prospect, though
the south is still crying for more. The season prom
ises to be carl}', and, strange to say. there has been no
fiost of any consequence thus far. We occasionally
pet a frostiess spring, and this may be one of those
seasons. If Â«o there will be an immense crop of fruit
this srear.5 r ear.
The local and export trade of this port continues
Â£pod. and nobody is complaining. There is some halt
ir. the provision trade, and some lines of produce are
also dull: but. taking the list of commodities all
through, business is as good as could be expected at
this jime of the year.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETINGS.
MP. WOOD, secretary of the San Diego Cham
ber of Commerce, has issued a circular letter
â¢ suggesting an annual meeting of the secre
taries of the various commercial bodies on the Pacific
Coast for the purpose of conferring on issues with
which such organizations are concerned. It is hardly
necessary to give indorsement to a proposition of
this kind, for its merit is self-evident and will win
favor wherever it is given due consideration.
In his letter to his fellow secretaries Mr. Wood
says: "We arc of course thoroughly familiar with
our immediate surroundings, and some of us are
more or less acquainted with the products and com
merce of the entire Pacific Coast, but undoubtedly we
can all learn of one another, and the results of such
a conference could not but make us more useful of
ficers of the organizations we represent. * * *
My suggestion is that we organize an association for
the purpose above indicated, holding our first meet
ing at San Francisco some time within the next two
or three months."
This proposition comes timely and pertinent to the
movement now under way to provide for the estab
lishment of a Pacific Commercial Museum, on the
lines of the great institution at Philadelphia. It will
be a step in the direction of co-operation among the
commercial bodies of the coast, and will therefore
have an influence tending to advance the projected
museum.
While, however, the proposed organization will
serve to promote the enterprise undertaken here for
the establishment of the museum, its merit is by no
means confined to the service it will render in that
respect. Even were there no such thing as a commer
cial museum under consideration, it would still be of
advantage to have the commercial bodies of the coast
drawn into closer relations and affiliation with one
another, and an annual meeting of the secretaries
of such associations would materially aid in the ac
complishment of that end.
The Pacific Coast, while a part of the Union, has
many interests peculiar to itself, and to some of these
the East is indifferent, if not antagonistic. To pro
cure the legislation needed from the National Gov
ernment to promote the welfare of the Pacific States,
and to promote other coast interests not dependent
upon legislation, there is needed a strong system of
co-operative effort among progressive men. We
cannot have too many Pacific Coast organizations.
The more we have of those associations which incline
men to consider the welfare of the whole coast instead
of separate States the better off we will be, and the
more success we will have in developing the varied
resources of this rich section of the Union. Mr.
Wood's suggestion is therefore well deserving of a
cordial response from secretaries of kindred bodies,
and it is to be hoped the proposed meeting will be
airanged for an early date.
The Senate committee which has just made a report
upon the "extent to which adulterations or substitu
tions are used in food articles in this country has
suggested two methods of checking the evil, but we
notice with regret that neither remedy provides a
short and ready way of sending to prison the rascals
who manufacture the stuff.
NEIGHBORLY CONFIDENCES.
THE -: SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 12, 1900.
ONCE MORE TO THE FRONT.
SUPERVISOR TOBIN, if he keep his word;
1 will submit to the board at its -meeting to-day
the resolutions of the Police Committee con
cerning the reopening of Ingleside'" racetrack with
gambling privileges. It is therefore incumbent upon
the representatives of the people to appear once more
before the board to protest against the gamblers'
schemes and to demand the maintenance of laws in
the interest of private morality and public welfare.
At the meeting of the board last Monday Tobin, as
chairman of the Police Committee, *asked for further
time, as his committee was not ready to make a re
port. That hesitation was undoubtedly a concession
to popular sentiment. The Call had exposed the trick
contained in the resolution submitted by Tobin to the
committee, and the public had become aroused. Many
of the most influential pastors of the city had de :
nounced the scheme from their pulpits, and some
went before the' Supervisors to renew their protests.
In the face of that opposition Tobin did not venture
to make a report. Now we are to see what he will
do to-day.
Let it be borne in mind that the resolutions sub
mitted to the Police Committee, while nominally lim
iting racing and track gambling at Ingleside to a
period not exceeding forty days in any one year,
really authorize racing and gambling every day. The
resolutions, after setting forth the terms under which
authority shall be given for racing and gambling at
the track, say: "No such authority shall be granted
to any one person, copartnership, association or cor
poration for a period exceeding forty days in any one
year." It will be perceived that the track gamblers
have only to transfer the lease of the track from one
to another in order to get new permits for racing and
gambling every forty days as long as the year lasts.
TTie profits of track gambling are large under any
circumstances, but the Tobin scheme would make
them larger than ever, for it proposes to close up
poolrooms down town and give to the Eastern track
gamblers at Ingleside a monopoly. With such vast
profits. at stake the gamblers can afford to be patient
and persistent as well as cunning and unscrupulous in
their efforts to obtain the desired privilege. They
have waited a week for public indignation aroused by
the exposure of their scheme to die down. If before
the board to-day there appears again a strong body of
zealous defenders of morality and public interests to
protest against gambling schemes it is likely the To
bin committee will once more ask for further time.
It looks, therefore, as if this is to be a waiting fight
on the part of the Eastern track gamblers and their
allies. So long as it lasts, however, the representa
tives of the people must keep on guard, ready at all'
times for the fight when it comes. .
Once more, therefore, we urge the business men.
the taxpayers, thc'ivorkingmen, the pastors and rep
resentatives of all the better and stronger elements of
society to have an earnest delegation at the meeting
of the Supervisors to-day, in order that the popular
sentiment against track gambling shall be repeated
and re-emphasized.
The Call has every assurance that the fight against
the gamblers has been virtually won. The experience
of the city with the results of track gambling at Ingle
side under this same Eastern gang is still fresh in the
minds of the Supervisors, j They know the fearful list
of crimes and suicides shown in the records of the
police courts, the criminal courts and the Morgue,
and it is not likely a majority of them will be willing
to renew that blight upon the community. Never
theless it will be well to have them backed up in their
stand for law and morality, and therefore the friends
of good government should to-day show themselves
once more to the front when the issue comes up.

launched last year at the Portsmouth
dockyard. The material In her construc
tion cost J1.520.000 and the cost of labor

Simultaneously -with this ship the Jena,

The cost of material and labor footed up

Is the watchward of men and women who

stagnation arc mental death. Nations, cities
and individuals that progress arc not afraid to
get cut of the beaten path- The aggressive,
earnest, intelligent man or woman ,is not
bound by codes or dogmas. They think for
themselves, and humanity benefits thereby.
As a class, the medical profession is clannish.
The eld school smacks of decay. Bleeding
and blistering died hard, but died nevertheless,
while homeopathy continues to progress. The
great Pasteur was not a physician, yet he

fol!ow. A few bright, active, progressive phy"

CONQUEST OF OUR STATE
"The Conquest of California" Was tho
title of a sermon delivered yesterday
morning by the Rev. Philip Coombe, pas
tor of the Richmond Congregational
Church. lie said in part:
When the Stars and Stripes were raised at
Monterey July 1, I&J6, and the declaration was
made at LosAntcles August 13 of -the same
year that this country belonged to the United
States a great acquisition was made to Amer
ica, a great vldtory was gained for California:
but the true conquest of California will not be
made until all the , people of the entire State
take hold of Its sreat interests and control
them for, the King of Kings. This is the kind
of conquest which the pilgrim fathers came to
America to ; win, and which . their descendants
have nobly, helped California to gain and up
hold by sending men of. righteousness and
money without stint to these golden shores. It
is to this conquest of California I Invite your
hearty sympathy and energetic co-operation.

Â¦Benjamin Fay Mills delivered his lec
ture, "Heaven and Hell," at the Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon be
fore an audience that packed the audi
torium. He said in part:
"We have developed a conscience. As
we learned the value of men we are now
learning the infinite worth of humanity.
We no longer bow before the gods and In
carnations of the myi lologles of the past.
Important as their symbolism may have
been for our ancestors; we will know God
for -ourselves and not another. We dis
cover "tongues in trees, books In the run
ning brooks, sermons in stones and God
In everything.' We are slowly but surely
learning to love our neighbors as our
selves, in that we see that human society
Is one living organization, and that we
are indeed members one of another. We
have fairly stated at last what now seems
to us the ultimate .problem of the race
that we may learn to live each for all and
all for each, and If we have not all learned
its solution we have at least apprehended
it afar off. We have killed the devil and
are filling up hell. We regard as our
greatest glory, the . apprehension of the
glory yet to be." .._ ...Â»
SALE OF LIQUORS IN
PHILIPPINES DENOUNCED
In a prelude to hl3 regular sermon Rev.
E. A. Woods, D.D., pastor of the First
Baptist Church, last night spoke on "The
Saloon in Manila. In part he said:
Whatever may be said of the condltton of
the Filipinos before the islands came Into our
possesslun. they were not addicted to the use
of Intoxicating liquor*. President Schurman of
the American commission says: "I regret that
the Americans allowed the saloon to get a foot
hold on the Islands. That has hurt the Amer
icans more than anything: else. I have never
seen a Filipino drunkard." It Is paid that un
der Spanish rule there were but three saloons
In Manila and they sold only what are called
"soft drinks." Now there are 400 saloons sell
ing whisky and there are 300 dealers repre
senting American firms. The evil results among
our scldiers have been terrible. But If the na
tives are thus made a race of drunkards the
awful responsibility will rest upon our Gov
ernment. They have become our- national
wards and we have pledged ourselves to their
elevation and civilization.

No Truth in the Report of Illness

The Pacific Mail Company's steamship
Newport arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday, bringing twenty-three
cabin passengers and thirteen Chinese In
transit for Hongkong. " Among her cargo
were' 12,187. sacks of coifee, which Is the
largest and most valuable consignment
that has come here for a long time.
While the Newport was In Central
American waters a story came here to the
effect that Captain Saunders had died
while on the way south. As the popular
master had just recovered from a serious
Illness before taking command of the ves
sel his many friends took the news very
much to heart and awaited with fear and
trembling the confirmation or denial of
the story. Much to the joy of all con
rerned Captain Saunders was found to be
in better health than he has been for
month's and gaining flesh every day. He
had a little relapse while the vessel was
in Acapulco, and that : was what probably
gave rise to the story.;

ardent and most able advocates of thÂ«
constitution, and who by the year 1732 had
drifted into sympathy with Jefferson and
his followers, and had become a deter
mined opponent, open or disguised, of
Hamilton and his policy. Madison's con
spicuous position and influence made his
attitude upon public questions an im
portant one. and his separation from old
associates and his antagonism to their
cherished views, led naturally to bitter
personal enmities: but the sentiment
which charges Madison with political
apostasy is largely read Into the litera
ture of the day by writers whose political
ideas and feelings are the outgrowth of>
more modern conditions.
The First National Party Caucus.
In the first and second national elec
tions but one candidate was before thÂ»
people for the office of President. The
whole nation thought only of Washing
ton, and he seems to have been nomina
ted by general consent without any for
malities. The scattering votes for Vies
President in the election of 17S8 showsd
that no candidate for that office had been
agreed upon. But for that of 1732 sora*
understanding appears to have been pre
viously arrived at (though there is no
evidence of any meeting having been held
for the purpose), for all but four of thÂ»
electors voted for either Adams or Clln-
ton for Vice President.
Again, in 1756 there is reason to belier*
that Adams and Jefferson were generally!
regarded as the heads of their respectiva"
parties and were voted for by common
consent without formal nominations. But',
by the year ISOO a simple method for thÂ»
expression of the party will had been hit'
upon. In that year meetings were held
of the party members of the houses oC
Congress, "besides many distinguished)
citizens." as stated In Nlles' Register, for
the purpose of nominating candidates for
President and Vice President. From that
time until 192Â» the "Concessional party
caucus," as this assemblage is called, con
tinued to t*Â» used for placing Presidential
candidates betore the people. It was far
from being the nnly means adopted for
that purpose, for It never won the general
favor of the people and was never accept
ed as the party organ in any such sensa
as the convention has since been so ac
cepted.
Development of the Congressional
Caucus.
In 1804 the Federalists held no caucn*.
but In some unexplained way they did not
put forward candidates. Jefferson an<l
Clinton were nominated by the Republican
Congressional caucus". Four years later.
Jefferson having declined to accede to re
quests from party members of various
State Legislatures that he should for ri
third time become a Presidential candi
date, a Congressional party caucus wai
called by the Senator who had been chair
man of the preceding caucus. "In pursu
ance of the powers vested In him." M?ny
Democratic Congressmen looked a*kapcÂ»
upon this Indication of th* organization of
a permanent party machinery and re
frained from attending the caucus. The
Influence of Virginia was paramount In
this caucus, but Virginia was herself di
vided between Madison and Monroe, and
the friends of. the latter In Congress. find-
Ing themselves in a hopeless minority Li
the Congressional caucus, published short
ly after a denunciation of that method nS
nominating Presidential candidates, as .ar
rogating to a few. members of Congress
a right which belongs to the people alone.
In this year the Federalists again held
no caucus, but voted for Pinckney actd
In ISI2 the parties were divided within
themselves in respect to the war with
Kngland. What is called the "rejruHr"
Republican caucus was far from receiving
the support of all the Reoubllcan mem
bers of Congress, for 51 of the 13* remained
away. Nominations were made in several
of the States. The Legislature of Penn
sylvania nominated Madison and Georea
Clinton, and a meeting held afterward In
Pittsburg declared for Clinton and Fl
bridge Gerry. A mass-meeting" in New
Hampshire put forth a full ticket, lha
Republicans of the New York Legistatura
nominated De Witt Clinton as an anti
administration candidate, and at leact
four State conventions, besides numerous
county gatherings of Federalists, as well
as Republicans, declared for him. No
strictly party nominations were made by
the Federalists, though a secret meetlnff
of representatives of that party frtnn
many States made pledges to support Da
Witt Clinton.
The Republican members of Congress*
who favored the war were determined
that a war policy should dominate their
party and the incoming, administration,
even with the peace-loving Madison at its
head Before the caucus was held thav
communicated their purpose to the Presi
dent by means of a committee, of wnicl\
Henry Clay was chairman. Rather than
to fall of receiving a renominatlon Madi
son reluctantly consented to issue a war
message, and was soon afterward unani
mously renominated by the party caucus
at Washington, with Elbridge Gerry as
candidate for Vice President.
11. NATIONAL NOMINATING KA-
CHINEHT.
BY JESSE MACY, LL.D.
Ths Congressional Caucus.
Much confusion exists among writers
upon American political parties due to
their failure to distinguish clearly the two
quite different Ideas suggested by the
word party. There Is (a) the party of
the present day, a thoroughly organized
machine. Its parts all carefully adjusted
to one another and all working in har
mony to bring about and to uphold a
definite national -policy â that Is to say, to
form and to express in an effective man
ner the political opinions of a large body
of citizens. Quite another thing was (b)
the mere loose, temporary association of
men of like views in respect to some par-
tlcular question or questions of public" In
terest, which was all that the word Im
plied in the early years of the republic.
Many leaders of opinion were then deep
ly distrustful of tendencies to closer par
tisan union. Washington was careful to
declare himselfâ and no do"Â»>t with per
fect sincerity â "not a pa.Lj man." In his
first Inaugural address Jefferson asserts:
"We are all Republicansâ we are all Fed
eralists." He felt himself the representa
tive of the nationâ not of a party. Jack
son himself, whom we now know as the
great promoter of party spirit and parti
san methods, pronounced early in his po
litical career ; against partisanship and
the strengthening of party divisions.
Like any Institution possessed of true
vitality and entering dynamically, into the
life of a people, the American political
party of to-day is a growth, a' plant
whose roots ramify In the soil of the dis
"tant past, and a product far other than
the seed from which it sprung. As little
is the present Republican or. Democratic
j parts 1 like to the Federal or the Republican
party 100 years ago as the full-grown oak
is like to the acorn which gave it birth,
and clear thinking in political history
must sharply distinguish them.
The Federalists who fought for the
adoption of the constitution in 1759 agreed
together only upon one point, viz., that
under existing circumstances, threatened
as the young confederacy was by foes
without ana foes within, a closer, more
efficient union of States was Imperative,
and that the plan set forth in the-pro
posed constitution was the only, plan like
ly to prove acceptable In the existing
temper of the people .of the different
States. Men of opposing views as to the
various provisions of that document sunk
their differences and labored together to
the one endâ that, the nation might live.
The constitution once the law of the land
they were free, to contend with their
former allies upon every practical point
which should arise.
.In like manner the anti-Federalists
agreed among themselves only in their
opposition to the adoption of the consti
tution. They opposed it upon widely dif
ferent grounds and 'Yor diverse ends, and
their later political action had no neces
sary connection with their course during
the great constitutional struggle or that
of their colleagues of that period. It is
an error to Identify the Federalists of
1787-S9 with the Federalists who supported
the administration of , Washington and
John Adams, or to regard the Republican
party of the end of the eighteenth cen
tury as the political hÂ«r to the antl-
Federallsts. "Party consistency," "party
loyalty." were terms not yet In use. as the
ideas which they now stand for did not
yet prevail in America. Certain of the
anti-Federals of 17S0, even though they
dld not become supporters of the Federal
administrations which followed, still
counted themselves among the worship
ers of the constitution and the guardians
of. its integrity. Federalists of the same
year became persistent opponents of the
policy of the Federal party, and ultimate
ly ranged themselves under the Republi
can leaders. No one of them regarded
himself or was considered by others as a
political "ren*Â»Â«rade" or a "traitor." Par-,
tisan rancor did Indeed deal harshly with
Madison, who had been one of the most
WAENER'S BEMEDIES.
FLAMES NEARLY
DESTROY BIBB'S
LUMBER PLANT
. ,-. zr*z â¢
Loss Includes ' Practically
Everything but the
Machinery.
The ; Damage Will Foot Up Fully
Thirty Thousand Dollarsâ Origin
of the Fire Is a
Mystery.
About the only thing saved , in yester
day morning's fire, which destroyed the
furniture plant of the D. H. .Bibb Lum
ber Company at the" corner, of ' Beach and
Stockton streets, was the machinery situ
ated on the first" floor of ,the structure.
Everything in the line of woodwork
went: up in smoke and entailed a loss of
at least J30.000. D. H. Bibb, who owns a
controlling interest . in the concern, was
an interested spectator of the 'blackout d
ruins yesterday, and said that exactly
$82,000 had been put In the plant about two
years ago.
There was some $3000 worth of furniture
stored where the fire started, and this
was on the point of .being shipped to dif
ferent parts of the State. In addition to
this there were contracts on iiand and to
be filled amounting to several thousand
dollars. The machines known as "sur
facers" and "matchers" suffered little
damage, as the burning floor did not fall
In on them. The firm had just put In a
'"sander," which cost $2250. The men from
the underwriters were busy all day yes
terday oiling up the different machines,
and it is thought that with the expendi
ture of a few hundred dollars they may all
be; made available for use. The. work of
the firemen in this instance was remark
able, as the whole building was a mass "f
seething flames, but prompt action saved
much property which otherwise might
have. been destroyed. .
The-offlcers of the company are at a
loss to know what started the fire. Every
Saturday it was customary to turn on a
huge steam blower inside the premises for
the purpose of cleaning up the place of all
shavings and refuse. When- the men
knocked off work at 5 o'clock everything
was clean and apparently all right about
the building. Whether the fire had been
smoldering for eight hours from a care
lessly thrown away cigarette or cigar la
not known, but that theory seems to b3
plausible. Watchman Nelson discovered
the flames at 1 o'clock, and by that tun-*
the first alarm had been turned in. There
was little oil or varnish In the part where
the fiTe originated, but with the dry
woods the flames rapidly spread to the oil
warehouse, and the firemen had a rard
time there. As an evidence of their ex
cellent work, it is noteworthy that John
Twlgg's boathouse, fifty feet away, waa
not even scorched, and not a stick of lum
ber in Simpson's yard, directly opposite,
was charred. . ,
- Mr. Bibb says that there was about SK
000 insurance on the buildings and contents
in several companies. Negotiations ha<l
been opened for an' additional' $10,000, but
the risks were fo high that the idea v;as
abandoned. Fifty-eight men are thrown
out of employment as a result of the nre,
but the company will immediately rebuild
In about three months a fully equipped
plant will be in running order.

pews, aisles, gallery and allâ last night hy
a devout congregation come 10 hear
Father P. C. Yorke lecture upon "Rome."
"It is a peculiar thing," he said, "while
you can mention the greatest cities of the
world without provoking animosity or
feeling, the moment you name the city of
Rome people begin to take sides. To some
the name Rome calls up a feeling of lcy
alty and devotion; to others hatred .md
opposition. It is a name that awakens
everything good and bad in manâ a bless
ing or a curse.
"It was not always so. The time was
when it was merely a great city: the
greatest and the grandest of them all; the
center of the empire of the Caesars, whose
very word was law to all the world. Anil
this proud city, gleaming In the splendor
and beauty of its magnificence, one day
received a poor, unknown and unnoticed
manâ St. Peterâ who changed Rome that
was the city of a military nation *.o the
city of the world. He was sent by his
master in far off Jerusalem and told that
all the glorious pagan splendor would pass
away. St. Peter came to mighty Rr>n:c.
poor and without friends, but mighty \n
hope, and this city, that looked so Dros
perous, was already declining in its bruta'
strength. No longer was it to be wrappe-i
in the purple of imperialism, but in the
purple of the blood of martyrs, spreading
its name by virtue of the cross of Christ."
Father Yorke devoted the latter pa-t of
his lecture to a description of the catne
drals of St. John, Lateran, St. Mary's. St.
Paul's and St. Peter's. In speaking of thÂ«Â»
grandeur and magnificence of the places
of Catholic worship, the speaker said:
"For this reason it has been charged
that Catholicity fosters Ignorance. Go to
Rome and this belief will be obliterated.
The many rooms of the Vatican, the soul
stirring cathedrals, are open to the whole
world; they exist for the visitor, the tour
ist, the scholar and the scientist, thn his
torian who writes of past ages and whose
material can be obtained from no other
source."
leather Yorke closed with a beautiful
word picture of St. Peter's Cathedral and
all that it inspires of religious feeling.
INCESSANT CONFLICT
RAGES IN MAN'S NATURE
Father Yorke's sermon at St. Mary's
Cathedral yesterday morning was on the
subject, "A New Heaven and a New
Earth." In his discourse the reverend
lecturer said that there was an irrepres
sible conilict going on between the natural
and supernatural forces in man's nature,
and from it he drew the conclusion that
in the final victory or defeat lies the soul's
salvation or damnation.
"Man is made up not only of body and
soul," said Father Yorke, "but there is a
supernatural element in him which is con
stantly battling for supremacy over the
insidious attacks of his natural or ma
terial being. Here, in the human heart,
does heaven make its fight against earth.
The angels of light are arrayed against
the ministers of darkness. It is not a bat
tle of flesh and blood, but of principalities
and powers against the spirit of wicked
ness In high places.
"We are not properly equipped to wage
the unequal struggle, and the soul is too
prone to compromise and sink itself in
the dust. Only by the grace of God can
we work out our own salvation. There is
no decisive victory or defeat until the end
comes. The battle goes on with varying
fortunes from day to day. but the result
of the last conflict will seal our fate for
all time.
"There is an end to everything in this
world. In the great enterprises. of man
kind may be discerned. a struggle against
forces that conquor in the end. Every
thing, even we ourselves, lasts for a short
time only. There is the season of growth,
maturity and decay, and the world knows
it no more. Death is active always, and we
eventually realize that the sun is going
down in the heavens and the day is over
for us. Do not leave the settlement of
your affairs until the end, for before you
know it the Judgment begins, and then it
is too late. We are face to face with our
sins, and satan stands before the thrOne
of God to demand his own. God has Kiven
us means .in plenty to carry out his
ideals, and we should take advantage of
them in order to merit salvation."

CHASED THROUGH
THE STREETS BY
HIS ANGRY WIFE
Mrs. Walter Gallagher Gives
Her Husband a Sprint
ing Lesson.
Policeman Joy Stops An jp-y Woman
as She Is Rapidly Overhaul
ing Her Spouse and Is
Roundly Abused.
â â â¢
The spectacle of a well dressed woman
chasing a man, who was frantically en
deavoring to escape, created considerable
excitement and attracted a large crowd
on Market street yesterday afternoon.
The woman was Mrs. Walter Gallagher
and the man who was trying to lose her
was her husband.
Gallagher, who Is an attorney, was
promenading Market street when he
espied his wife standing near Powell
street. Hoping to evade her, Gallagher
darted into a building close by, trusting
that his wife had not seen him and that
she would get tired and return home.
While the attorney was congratulating
himself on his escape his enraged spouse
suddenly appeared, and after charg'ng
him with conduct unbecoming a dutiful
husband she smote him on the wrist. That
was all Gallagher wanted. Without wait-
Ing to explain matters to his pugilistic
wife he picked up his silk hat, which had
fallen from his head, and dashed across
Market street, wlthMrs. Gallagher in hot
pursuit. â¢ '
Breathless and exhausted, Gallagher,
seeing that his wife was fast gaining on
him, jumped on a passing street car, buÂ»,
picking up her skirts, Mrs. Gallagher tooK
a flying leap for the car, landing safely
on the rear platform.
Gallagher happened to turn around, and
seeing his wife elbowing her way through
the passengers, promptly jumped off and
started up Market street. His wife was
after him in an instant and the motor
man, who recognized the attorney,
shouted: "Let'er go. Gallagher:"
Mrs. Gallagher dropped her purse con
taining several dollars In alighting from
the car. but that did not cause her to
stop. She ran screaming up the street,
gaining on Gallagher at every step,
when Policeman Joy, who is opposed to
foot-racing on the Sabbath, appeared on
the scene and stopped her. Mrs. Gal
lagher, seeing uer husband disappearing
tn the distance and prevented from con
tinuing the pursuit, became virtuously In
dignant at the action of the policeman
and threatened to take- him before the
Police Commissioners, but after consider
able coaxing she was induced to go home.
Gallagher may still be running. v v t ;~
awfully offended If he did not."
From that time on until the close of the
Interview Mr. Platt did the talking for
Mr. Artsimovitch.
JUDGE REILLY'S
WARSHIP PROVES
FLEET OF FOOT
Wins Open Stake at Union
Coursing Park From
a Big Field.
? â ... .
Eugene Geary's Young Greyhound
Palo Alto, the Greatest Son of
Em in Pasha, Is the
Judge P. J. Rellly's white and brindle
greyhound, Warship, went flying through
the big open stake at Union Coursing
Park yesterday, winning the big end of
the purse for his owner. He met in suc
cession Brutus, Ireland, Maud N, Royal
Flush, the stake favorite. Royal Union
(from his own kennels) and In the decid
ing course, Palo Alto, pronounced by
many coursing men the most promising
young dog in the State.
The critical point of the stake for War
ship was his meeting in the fourth round
with Royal Flush. They first ran an un
decided course, the score being 1 to 1. In
this Warship led to the hare by a length
ard forced it to Flush, which killed.
Judge Grace sent them back to "slips"
again and another hare was released.
This time Warship led by two lengths,
secured. the first turn and then his oppo
nent killed, making the score 3 to 2 in
favor of Warship. In the next round he
had to go against his kennel mate, Royal
Ur.lon, as Palo Alto, the only other dog
in the stake, was entitled to a bye course,
of which he could not be deprived. War
ship won. Â¦
The final was a sensational course In
which both dogs were thoroughly tested.
Palo Alto led from slips, but Warship
gradually pased him out for the turn. Ihe
followers of Palo Alto then had an op
portunity to cheer as the young dog took
possession of the hare and in an instant
had the score 4 to 3 in his favor. The hare
was a strong one and stood up sufficiently
long for Warship, with his more matured
staying powers, to wirt""uHlmately by a
score of 10 to 7. Palo Alto is a remark
ably fast greyhound, and with more ex
perience is expected to prove formidable
in any company. At present his only fault
is that he steadies himself when near his
game before dashing in to kill. He is ex
pected to get over this with a little more
practice on the field. His hardest course
up to the final yesterday was with Nar
cissus, whom he beat after an undecided
course, and Narcissus was a strong fa
vorite. The detailed results of the run

OLYMPIC PIGEON SHOOT.
Local Wingshots Open the Season at
Ingleside Grounds.
The Olympic Gun Club held its first
phoot of the season at the Ingleside
grounds. The scores were not up to the
usual standard, some of the best men
making poor totals owing, they claim, to
lack of practice. Though the day was a
beautiful one. a light breeze would have
helped the results. Harvey McMurchy
made the only clean score of the day, and
the clever manner in which the celebrated
wing shot dropped his birds elicited much
applauee from the members of the club,
whoee guest he was.

Confides to a Friend That the Cere

MRS. WEBSTER JONES MAY
WED THE RUSSIAN CONSUL
PERSISTENT rumors have been cir
culated to the effect that Vladimir
Artsimovitch. the Russian Consul
In this city, and Mre. Webster
Jones are coon to be married. The
lady has confided the secret to her friends
and the Consul is ca!d to have whispered
the story to his acquaintances. The plans
of the couple depend In a great degree
upon Mr. Artsimovitch's promotion to rep
resent his country in a consular capacity
at Berlin. He has learned from private
sources that he is favorably considered
for the position, and as soon as he gets
official notice of his appointment it is
probable that he will publicly announce
his engagement to Mrs. Jones.
According to the intimate friends of the
couple, the wedding Is not to take place
In this country. Mr. Artslmovitch is so
confident of b<*!ng transferred to Berlin
that he calculates, so It is said, to have
his prospective bride follow him there,
when the marriage will be celebrated.
Mrs. Webster Jones received some un
pleasant notoriety about five months ago
in an action she brought against h*>r husÂ»
hand in Scinta Barbara for a divorce. Her
epouse made no contest, and she was
pranted a derree, since which , time FhÂ«;
ar.d her two children have been living
with her parents. Mr. and Mrs. H. H.
Hobb*. at 202S Bush street. For the past
i>v. days she has been stopping with
i'rt^nds at San Mateo.
Mrs. Harry Sherwood of 1423 Central
avenue. Alameda. is one of the friends to
whom Mrs. Webster Jones confided that
she was to marry the Russian Consul.
When seen yesterday Mrs. Sherwood said:
"Yes. Mrs. Jones and Count Artslmo
yitch are engaged to be married. Mrs.
JonÂ«^ told me so. I know nothing of the
details and do not think the public has
any riÂ£ht to meddle In such matters."
Net long ago the Count w:is entertained
at dinner by some friends across the bay
and on that occasion he is reported to
have told of his prospective call to Berlin
and announced that Mrs. Webster Jones
would follow him there and become his
bride.
The persistency with which rumor had
coupled his name with that of Mrs. Jones
evidently worried the Consul, for last
night he appealed to Horace Platt at the
Pacific Union Club to save him from
newspaper notoriety. Acting- on the ad
vice cf Mr. Platt he consented to be ln
torviewed by a representative of The
Call. When the interview reached Its most
interesting stape Mr. Platt rushed to tha
rescue of the Consul and saved him from
the embarrassment of either denying the
assertions made by Mrs. Jones relative to
their approaching marriape or admitting
that Dame Rumor was correct in her sur
mises.
"I have learned from private sources."
paid the Count, "that my Government
thinks favorably o* promoting me to tha
position of Consul to Berlin. I dare not
say anything about it at this time, ie;
foar my people may think I am too frtsh,
all my chances would be spoiled.
"Now, as to my marriage with Mrs.
Jones, all I can say is that I am not in
the habit of taking the public into my
confidence in my private affairs. If it
vrere so. I " then appeaiingly to Mr.
Platt: "Really. Mr. Platt. what shall I
tell him," referring to the reporter.
"Why, tell him there Js nothing: in it, of

know there Is no truth in the rumor, for
the Count would have taken me into hla

MRS. WEBSTER JOiNES.
CHIEF OFFICER NERVICH of the
American bark Undaunted will not
forget Ji> a hurry the experience he
had on the water front a few. nights
ago. At an early hour Saturday morning,
when, according to the edict issued by
the city fathers, all the lights were out,
he was waylaid and robbed and is now
lying* aboard the ship in a precarious
condition. Two physicians have been in
attendance on him and their opinion is
that Nervlch, although his wounds are
serious, has a. fair chance o? recovery.
The Undaunted left here about a year
ago for Puget Sound, where she loaded
lumber for Australia. After discharging
her cargo on the other side she loaded
coel at Sydney, N. S. W., and sailing on
November 24 arrived here on February 18.
During the voyage there was considerable
friction between the chief officer and the
men. When the sailors came ashore some
of them were heard to say that they
would get even with Nervich, but nobody
paid any attention to them. "When all
hands were paid off there was no friction
and the mate and men seemed to be good
friends.
When the Undaunted docked at Green
street wharf some of the old hands came
around, but they did not speak to Ner
vlch nor did they attempt to board the
ship. While the bark was discharging
they still hung around and the man work
ing the donkey engine told the mate they
were keeping track of â¢ him. Nervlch
laughed, treated the whole matter as a
Joke and said he was able to take care of
himself.
On Friday Captain Davidson went up
town during the afternoon and Chief Of
ficer Nervlch was left in charge of the
vessel. He had nearly $500 on his person
and also carried a gold watch and chain.
As soon as the captain was gone the mate
strolled up the dock, and crossing the
street, made his way through the cars
standing on the belt railroad, entered a.
saloon and had a drink. The journey
was repeated again and again.
About this time the steward of the bark
warned him that the -gang was on the
lookout for him, but Nervich only laughed
and again started ashore to have just one
more drink before turning in. When he
failed to come back In an hour the stew
ard started out to look for him. A dili
gent search of all the saloons in the

neighborhood of Green and tast streets
failed to reveal any trace of the missing
Finally about 5 o'clock Saturday morn
ing Nervlch was found among the freight
cars on the belt railroad more dead than
alive His face was beaten almost into
a jelly and his body was one mass of
bruises. All his money and his watch
and chain were gone, his pockets being
turned Inside out. â¢ â.Â»
Nervlch was taken aboard the ship and
when able to tell his story said that about
midnight he started back for the ship.
All of a sudden the llgnts went out and
he got lost among the cars on the railroad
siding. There some one hit him on the
heart and he doesn't remember anything
after* that. Nervlch thinks that there were
only three men in the gang that assault
ed "him and that none of them had ever
sailed on the Undaunted. The steward,
however, asserts that there were four
men on the outlook all day and that two
at least of them came from Australia on
Chief Officer Nervlch is well known on
the Pacific Coast, having been five years
master of the Gatherer and also having
commanded other vessels.
Paul Vaudiot. who was the mate of the
expedition under Lieutenant Gillmore.
captured by the Filipinos while exploring
the Baler River, was found shortly before
3 o'clock yesterday morning by Policeman
Tracey stretched out on the roadway at
New Montgomery and Jessie streets. His
face was covered with blood, and Tracey
rang for the ambulance and had him sent
to the Receiving Hospital. His upper jaw
was fractured, both lips were cut. the
wound in the upper lip extending to the
nasal cavity, four teeth were knocked out
and there was a deep cut on his forehead.
After his wounds were dressed nothing
could be seen but his eyes and mouth.
He could scarcely speak, but managed
to say that he had been drinking. The
last thing he remembered was leaving the
New Europe Hotel on Sansome street. He
thought some one struck htm on the bacK
of the head, but his recollection was very
hazy. Dr. Starr, who dressed the wounds,
said they could not have been caused by
a fall. It is thought that robbery wa3
the object and that the thieves were
scared away before they secured his
money. The police are investigating the
case.
The other sailor w.-is John E. Day. who
left here on. the Concord for the Orient
nearly two years ago, returning on the
Solace. He went to a theater Saturday
night with two friends, but got sepa
rated from them. He visited some of tho
resorts on Grant avenue and yesterday
morning found himself on the ground In a
lane off Grant avenue. His lip was cut
and he had been robbed of nearly $100.
He called at 40 Ellis street unon Recruit
ing Officer Roydon of the Marine Corps
and asked for the loan of t". telling htm
he had been drugged and robbed. Roy
don gave him the money and he was ad
vi.Â«od to go to the Receiving Hospital to
have his wounded lip dressed. He did so
and then reported the robbery at police
headquarters to Captain Bohen. Unfor
tunately he had no recollection of where
he had been, but simply remembered go

Despite thÂ«Â» evasions of the Count, rumor
persists that the woddlng will take place,

DESERTED A HALF
DOZEN CHILDREN
E. A. Freeman and His Wife De-
liberately Abandon Their
Entire Family.
-OAKLAND. March 11.â A family of a
half-dozen children, one of the youngest
confined to its bed with pneumonia, de
serted by both parents, was found to
night at 1010 Twenty-sixth avenue and 'â¢*-
ported to the police. The report was made
by neighbors, who said that the father, E.
A. Freeman, had left two weeks ago and
the mother on Saturday, and that since
then the children had been shifting for
themselves and that the sick child wus
without medical attendance. - '
The house was destitute of the ordinary
necessities of life, much less any of the
comforts.
E. A. Freeman, the father, Is a painter,
who has been working when he could get
a chance. He had hard luck during the
winter, and about two weeks ago he dis
appeared, leaving the entire burden of the
support of the family upon his wife. Mrs.
Freeman swore -to a complaint charging
him with falling to provide for his minor
children, but the warrant Is still un
served, for Freeman is out of the city.
Mrs. Freeman capped the climax by
dropping out of sight on Saturday, leav
ing the family to shift for itself. To
night, when she failed to return home,
the case was reported to the police as one
that needed their attention. Temporary
relief and medical aid having been fur
nished them, an effort will be * made to
nnd the parents to-morrow, and some
thing will be done for the care of the
children. The police Â»ay that this la a

Funeral.
?
BERKELEY. March 11.â Escorted by
fifty students of the freshman class of the
University of California, the remains of
Charles Carter and his brother Alexander
were taken from the family residence nt
2111 Rose street this morning to the South
ern Pacific 3tation at East Berkeley, for
shipment to the Carters' former home at
Byron, where the remains of the brothers
were interred this afternoon.
Three students accompanied the Dodles
to Byron, where they acted as pallbearers
and a? representatives of the clasa of
which Charles Carter was a popular mem
ber. These pallbearers were Robert SUi
iey. president of the class: Charles Bailey
and J. T. Barry. The class sent a flnr.il
tribute In. the shape of a large pillow with
the monogram "U. C." worked In blue and
gold.
Many other friends of the dead brothers
sent tributes of respect, and everything
possible was' done to soften the blow
which has fallen so heavily upon the fam
ily.
Mr. and Mrs. Carter are so prostrated
from the shock of the tragedy that they
have been constantly under the care of
phyelclans. Charles Carter waÃ'the :"Ol: "Ol
of his parents, who were making â¢every
sacrifice to- give, him a university educa
tion. He was a manly, clean-cut young
student, and his untimely death has
caused a deal of sympathy to go forth to
the stricken parents and sisters.
The Carters will probably give up their
home In Berkeley in order to get away
from the scenes which would recall daliy
the awful tragedy which has blighted
their lives.

Correspondence of the Associated Press.
BORSOGON, Luzon, Jan.- 21. â Colonel
Howe and four companies; of the Forty
seventh Regiment were no sooner estab
lished at Sorsogon than General Kobbe
gave 'orders for the occupation of Bulan
and Donsol. J Bulan is twenty-five miles
south of Â¦ Sorsogon and Donsol"; Is thirty
miles, above it..' They, are both small coast
towns. Companies A and D of the Forty
seventh were transported, by the Helena
to Donsol and Company, B was carried by
the Nashville to Bulan. . " â¢ .-
When the Helena- appeared off Donsol
men and women could be seen leaving the
town,' carrying bundles of household goods
with^them. ' iU '. .-';: .
The beach \ trenches were lined with
peering; faces," and the only: flag over the
town was SDanlsh. Donsol appeared as
a few zinc-roofed warehouses ; and some
long lines of thatthed huts on a low tan
gle of green jungle on the -coast. One
company of soldiers "was loaded 'into the
Helena's small boats. This action was
immediately followed by much ! activity
behind the trenches, whereupon the lead
ers of this â¢' expedition ' decided ' upon
another course of action. The Helena's
launch, with Major Wise and Lieutenant
Kobbe on board, ran in forthe beach,
towing, a small rowboat. When' close to
the shore the launch stopped and the row
boat, manned by three Filipinos and car
rying a big white flag of truce, landed in
front of the trenches. Meanwhile .the
Helena had cleared for action a/id the
soldiers still on "board were sent to cover,
while . those already in the small boats
were waiting just astern in tow of the
tug Nunez: The British gunboat : Clover
had meantime come in from the south and
was now, lying to a few "hundred yards
from the Helena. ... - . .' â¢
It is doubtful if she was recognized from
the shore as other than an American ship.
Sparred for Dslay. â¢ .
The boat with the flag of truce soon re
turned to the Helena, and a. little later
Major Wise announced the result of the
parley, saying, "They want until 3 o'clock
this afternoon to decide whether- tht-y
want to resist us or surrender, but I guess
we'll be going ashore right now."
The company in the boats started for
the beach, and the Helena prepared- to
plow the village up in case our men were
llrcd on.' . - ._â¢Â¦:.
When our men landed on the beach not
a face was to be seen, at the trenches.
We formed In company front and then
small squads were started through the
town. It was absolutely deserted, not a
soul being in sight. In the streets .were
half-pillaged trunks and bundles of house
hold goods, food and clothing.
Finally, on a low hill, about 600 yards be
hind-the town the enemy was discovered
clustered in and about a small trench and
around a last century muzzle-loading can
non. , . ' ' ' '."
Meanwhile Major Wise had gone to the
door of the : house from which fleW the
Spanish flag. â¢ He knocked at the door,
and the commander of the Filipino forces
in that town, the local president and the
civil governor of the district, all in the
person of a brown man in a Filipino uni
form, came and lot him in. :
Flag Hauled Down.
'-'Will you fiaul down that Spanish flasr?
I want to put this one in its place," said
the major, producing the American flag.
There was< no -objection to the. request,
and the stars mnd stripes soon floated
over Donsol.': : Â¦
The Helena. quickly landed the second
company. Â¦
As Captain Hart and a dozen men were
crossing the rice fields between, the town
and the hill, where the enemy were, there
was a sudden volley :of about twenty bul
lets from the Filipinos. Most of the bul
lets sang over Captain Hart's head, on
over the village and so out to sea. The
enemy were firing high. They had left
us a message in town'saylng they would
give us battle on the heights.
â¢ "Send .them word thatif they do not
surrender and bring in their cannon . in
two hours I'll have the navy shell their
position," answered Major Wise. ; '/,.'.-;.
Hilltop Deserted.
The President found 1 a messenger for
this reply, and he was on his way to the
hilltop when the first volley was â¢ tired.
Then began the storming of Donsol
Heights. We had been told there was
but twenty, rifles and a small store of
ammunition among the insurgents, and aa
our soldiers started Â«for" the hill" we saw
the enemy disappearing from -their
trenches at its top. No one thought they
were waiting for us. Our soldiers went
laughing, panting and stumbling through
the jungle that grew on the hillside and
came to the top victorious, for there was
no. enemy in sight. . From beside the old
brass cannon there was a good view of
the country behind the town, and as we
looked the woods began to show our fleet
footed enemy. They^peered out at us from
behind nearly every clump of ; trees. We
caught sight of them in threes and dozens
as the slunk ; through the Jungle, appar
ently waiting to comeb ack Into town,
but not- quite flaring to attempt it. From
a clump of bushes not a hundred yards
away .we presently: flushed two natives.
They came holding out their bows and
arrows and trembling with fear. When
Major Wise told -them later they would
be paid money for carrying water for the
American soldiers these two men asked:
"Is this true, or is it some-joke?"
Harsh tales had been told them of what
the Americans would do to prisoners and
this promise of work and wages could not
be believed ;without special- assurance of
its truth and validity.''
Â¦'..' -*. Chinese Stayed to -Pillage. ;. ;
The Chinese residents of Donsol had hot
abandoned the â¢ town. They hid away in
shacks and warehouses, coming out later
in the afternoon and taking advantage of
such opportunities as the occupation by
our soldiers made possible to loot Filipino
houses. But this practice was -quickly
terminated by- the American officers. ~ ,
There was little enough food ~in <this
town of Donsol and back in the hills there
is still less. The natives , already -have
begun to come back to the village, bring
ing their families and as this continues
Major Wise will soon have a" communi ty
to administer. ; , â¢
Company B and the Nashville. met with
no resistance at Bulan. Â¦ The natives did
not'abandon the town, but Instead crowd
ed down to the beach to witness our land-
Ing. " It seems that about : three : weeks
ago three Tagalos walked Into Bulan and
in the name of thc^ Filipino Government
ordered- the townspeople to construct
trenches'. for c.thee .the" defense of ' the place.
This -the people did. whereupon the Ta
galos Â¦ went * away and that* was i the . first
and ' the , last time . the * people â¢ of . Bulan
ever saw any insurgents. ; Bulan :â¢ has â¢ suf
fered Â¦ much from /lack of food -during

CHRIST THE SOCIALIST.
Dr. Simmons Speaks of the Great
Master's Sympathy for the
J Poor.
The Turk-street Temple was well filled
last evening by a large number of Social
Democrats, who had gathered to hear the
speaker of the evening,"- Rev. L. Wi Sim
mons. . , . . .Â¦Â¦ - - .â¢:.."
Dr. Simmons'. discourse <was entitled
?'The Spirit of Socialism as , Manifested by
Jesus Christ." In this title the speaker
clearly- defined the lines .on . which he
would talk. He started in by saying that
he. himself -was a thoroughgoing social
ist in all that was implied by a correct
understanding of the word." - By a social
ist he meant one who. loved his fellow
man, and^if one-was a socialist and lived
up to its teachings he could not do other
wise than love and endeavor to help his
fellow man; ?jy*3aSaggKÃJtipH|
.The speaker then .went on to review the
life of : the Savior. He showed ! how he
loved the poor and decried the amassing
of riches and how his whole life was de
voted to the elevation of the lowly and the
unfortunate and how ill his sympathies
were forever on; the sloe of the man who
worked with his hands. ' ' : . ~
SCHOOLBOY CAUGHT
STEALING PAPERS
Lincoln Keeffe Gathered Sixteen From
Doorsteps on Ellis Street Yes
terday Morning.
.Heports are constantly â¢ being received
from newspaper subscribers of their pa
pers belng.stolen, particularly Sunday
mornings, and the police, have repeatedly
been instructed to keep a sharp lookout
for the thieves, but owing to the cunning
of the culprits in waiting till the officers
left their beats to report off duty they
have succeeded-ln evading arrest.
About 7 o'clock yesterday morning 1 C.
A. Park/ a paper carrier, saw a'small
boy stealing papers from the doorsteps of
houses on Ellis* street, near Octavia. He
watched him, and when he had gathered
sixteen altogether he thought it time to
call a halt and . collared the youngster,
handing" him over to Policeman Wolters.
The boy was taken to the City Prisoi\ and
booked on a 1a 1 charge of petty larceny and
the sixteen papers were registered as
evidence against him. He gave his name
as Lincoln Keeffe, a schoolboy; 10 years
of age. He intended selling the papers.
He will appear before Judge Cabaniss
this morning. ..

posed reopening of, the Ingleside race
track. He said that while his long ab
sence in the Orient did not permit of his
speaking with any degree of accuracy ci
the details of the matter, yet in a genes al
way he thought it would work untoid
harm to the young men of the city and to
the reputation of San Francisco abroad.
He said that every one knew of the evils
of gambling and of the corrupting Influ
ence of a racetrack on the morals of a
city. That many of the crimes that have
stataed the fair name of this city are at
tributable to the evil influences of rice
track gambling Is as well known abroad
as It is right here, and it would put San
Francisco . in very bad odor when it be
came known that our city fathers had de
liberately reopened this modern casket of
Pandora after they had once succeeded in
getting It tightly closed.
OPPOSED TO THE
REOPENING OF
THE RACE TRACK
Ministers Will Enter Their
Protest Against Any
Such Action.
Large Delegation -of Clergymen Will
Attend the Meeting of the Su
i pervisors To-Dayâ What ,
H. J. McCoy Says.
Â¦..Â¦ â¢ â .
It is a foregone conclusion that .the In
gleside racetrack will not be granted the
privilege of ' adding ! more victims to its
already long list. The unfortunates who
are now serving terms of imprisonment
for crimes brought about through the
temptations of the racecourse will not be
joined by others who might fall from the
same cause, as the members of the Board
of Supervisors have expressed their de
terrhination to vote against any ordinance
which has for 'its object the reopening of
the Ingleside track. -
The score of ministers who, on Monday
last, appeared before the Board of Super
visors and presented resolutions passed by
their ministerial unions will attend the
meeting to-day and ask to be heard in the
matter. They will point out to the board
the dangers which -would' follow the re
opening of the track, the' disasters that
would result,? the sorrow it would bring
to hundreds of families and the curse that
would be, saddled upon the city. An earn
est appeal will . be made to the members
of the board not to sully their reputations
at the outset of their career under the
new charter by countenacing a measure
which is certain to bring down the wrath
of every- good- citizen on their heads.
.Chairman Tobin of the Police Committee
on Thursday last positively declared that
his committee would be ready to report on
the Ingleside track matter at to-day s
meeting of the board, and Mayor Phelan
Invited the ministers to return this after
noon and he would grant them the privi
lege of addressing the board on this ques
tion. Members- of every religious denom
ination will therefore be on hand to pro
test against the passage of the proposed
ordinance. r ..' â¢â¢ Â¦-_'
xa. J. McCoy, secretary of the Young
Men's Christian Association, made the fol
lowing forcible statement yesterday: , -
.. "Nothing is more demoralizing to I the
young men of San Francisco than the op
eration of a racetrack in- the immediate
vicinity. Not only is the vice of gambling
pernicious -in itself, <Â¦-. but - racetrack gam
bling is doubly so because of the fascina
tion it seems to have V for the average
young fellow | when -he once becomes I in
iated Into ; its â¢ vicious mysteries, and ; be-;
cause of tne associations that are connect
ed with it. â¢ - -â¢ , . -.*;
"The proximity of a big racetrack to a
city means that the city will be overrun
by the crowd of thieves, prostitutes, sure
thing , gamblers, : confidence â¢ men and riff
raff that are always to be found following
the horses and the men who make their
livingby running them. , -
"This city in particular has had so many
fearful i examples lof th-Â« ! degrading influ
ences of racetrack, gambling that It should
never | even so much as seriously | consider
a proposition Â¦ to' license the: so-caned
sport. There have been any number of
tragedies that are to be traced directly, to
the; influences of the, races, suicides and
murders.- to Â¦â¢ say : nprning of.:; the lesser
crimes of defalcation and theft. ',...Â¦ "."
Â¦.- "In my opinion it is the solemn duty of
every citizen, "who has' the good name of
the city at heart and'whb Is' interested in
preserving: - the > moral i welfare Â¦ of : his ' chil
dren , to fight the ' proposed Â¦ reopening , of
Ingleside tooth and nail.".: '

, The address of Mr. Carrington, .while re
ligious i In* Its / character" and ; largely * de
voted y to ii the ;,work * that 'â has ' been l done
among . the . benighted ' Inhabitants of â¢ the
far. off Orient, was not wholly on matters
religious. â¢._..- v.. .v, -;-/
In discussing local affairs after . the : lec
ture : Dr. Â£ Carrlnffton . ; referred : to ; the ; pro-
was decided not to allow any refuse from
houses of the district to be carded away.
Instead arrangements will be made to
burn whatever rubbish accumulates.
The . Proposed Inspection-
Dr. Kinyoun advised that when the in
spection is started that It be finished In
one day. It would take at least 250-nvn
to do It in that time he thought. He sug
gested, too, that the inspection be repeat
ed every day for at" least fifteen days,
that being the time within which it Is
supposed any case will manifest itself.
A telegram from Surgeon General Wy
man, chief of the tynited ' States Marine
Hospital service, wad read. He offered to
supply the board with "curt" serum and
"preventive" serum for the disease if it
was found necessary! Chief of Police Sul
livan said he would furnish all the pol'ce
for escort or guard or < quarantine pur
poses that the board should ask. for.
That was the extent of the business of
the meeting. It has amounted to no more
than a decision to inspect Chinatown, and,
if possible, to clean itâ a matter that has
been agitating the public mind for some
time past. The board and the physicians
who met with them last night are unani
mous in the.opinion that there is no cause
for alarm. It was even suggested that
nothing be said of the matter at ail, but
as the volunteer inspectors had to be
called for it was found necessary to pub
lish the matter anyway. And, besides
that, the Mayor sarcastically said he
thought it was "too good a story for the
papers to keep." Unwittingly he gave hla
personal organ another wrap by the state
ment.
It Is not generally known that when
the suspected case was first discovered
the morning papers and the evening pa
pers, with the exception of the Exam
iner, agreed to say nothing about it at
least until It was proved beyond a doubt
that the case was one of genuine plague.
All the other papeVs had agreed, and
when the fact was reported to the Ex
aminer it declined to be a party to the
agreement, and in its fierce desire to
spring a sensation it not only refused to
wait with the report of the case, but it
telegraphed the whole story East to its
yellow companion, tfcÂ» Journal. This was
done while the heads of other papers and
the Associated Press were determined to
wait furtner developments before risking
the reputation of the. city. â¢
When it became known that the Exam
iner was going to work of its own will,
regardless of consequences, the other pa
pers could do no more than print the
news. That is how the East got hold of
the story, that the plague was rife in San.
Francisco. . _
It is not rooted in San Francisco, and
there is no possibility of it being here. The
case reported from Chinatown, ii it really
be the disease, is a single case, growing up
like a mushroom, and it is certain it has
no fellows. -
It is like the case -of typhus fever that
appeared at the County Hospital some
years ago. It ; came from no , one knew
where and it ended when it had claimed
its victim. -And there was Â¦ ay case of
cholera in New York a few .years, back
that started up fn the same way, brought
death to â¢ its - one â¢ victim and then stole
away. r '.....Â¦
No Cause for Alarm.
None of the doctors who discussed the
situation last , night were in any. vway
alarmed. The case calls for preventive
masures, just as would a case/, of fever,
but if only reasonable cleanliness is main
tained there can be no possibility of an
other case. The death of , the animals in
oculated must be taken a* pointing to a
case of the disease, but even without such
evidence the . board has decided it must
use the ounce of prevention, -which may
save the pound of cure. And anyway it
Is time Chinatown had a decent cleaning.

;=== tn i s cc j ty/ tn Â« on iy excuse, given being the deatu^ of . a -.Chinaman
who had been operated on and had been sick for a known period of
twenty days.
It Is well known that almost any Infected wound of the extremities will
cause an enlargement of the glands tributary to that part.
And further, there are several bacilli closely resembling that
said to be the cause of bubonic plague which will cause suppura- â¢
live inflammation of - the lymphatic glands, and further, these bac
teria in sufficient quantity would kill rats and guinea pigs, so
there is still room for doubt as to the disease being bubonic
plague if the animals did die.
In bubonic plague there Is usually an Infection with s'reptococcl as well
as with the plague bacilli, so that material taken from a bubonic gland would
also carry streptococci, to which the lower animals are also susceptible. ;
A careful post mortem examination of the Chinaman by. a
COMPETENT man would have shown "Snore than the foolish bac- v
teriological tests described by the daily papers.
From the manner in which the whole thing was gone about
it is evidently a claptrap political scheme from beginning to end,
and will hold up the medical men of San Francisco to be /the
laughing stock of the world.
The present method of appointing a Board of Health Is radically wrong.
Xo element of politics should enter into the health of a city. The election of
one man by each of the three regular medical colleges from its faculty
would Insure u^ competent men who would hardly inflict the city with a
similar disgrace. Yours respectfully. E. S. PILLSBURY,
Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, College of Physicians and
Surgeons.
Bpect Chinatown and all the inhabitants
In it, and then if any more suspected casei
are found to establish a quarantine.
There were present at the meeting Dr.
Williamson, Dr. Baum. Dr. Bazet and
Dr. McCarthy of the Board of Health;
Dr. O'Brien, the Health Officer; Dr. Kel
logg, the bacteriologist of the Health De
partment; Dr. Kinyoun of the quarantine
service. Dr. Gassaway of the Marine Hos
pital service and Dr. Montgomery of the
medical department of the State Univer
sity. Mayor Phelan and Chief of Police
Sullivan.
Dr. Williamson opened proceedings by
recounting the events of the pas.t week, the
Incident of the quarantine and the raising
of it after the board had become satisfied
there was no immediate danger. Then he
told of the death of the three animals In
oculated and called on Dr. KJnyoun to de
scribe the effect of the inoculation.
3>r. Kinyoun Describes the Plague.
Dr. Kinyoun said the post-mortem held
on the animals showed their blood was
full of microscopic organisms with all
the characteristics of the plague bacillus.
Two guinea pigs, a rat and a monkey
were inoculated, he said. The guinea
pigs and the rat were dead and . the
xnonkev was dying. He said all the ani
mals nhowed the same symptoms and the
eytnptnms were those of the plague.
Dr. Kellogg then described the symptoms
more in detail and declared there was no
doubt in his mind that the disease was
the plague.
Dr. Montgomery also spoke of what he
had observed. He added, too. that the
animals could be killed by the germs of
two other diseases that closely resembled
the germs of bubonic plague, but those
terms would not kill rats and be argued
from that fact that there was no doubt
in this case.
This was the substance of an hour's
desciiption of the effect oi! the inocula
tion upon the animals, and then the dis
cussion turned upon what was to be done.
It appeared at once that the board was
not particularly alarmed about the pos-
Ml.ilitie* of the situation, for the proposi
tion to quarantine Chinatown met with
disapproval at once. It vras considered
neither necessary nor advisable until by
a thorough inspection of the district it
could be ascertained whether or not' the
case of the Chinese was a sporadic one
taÂ«.en sick, whatever he might have con
tracted later.
.And there is no record of his case hav
ing changed its character from the time
he was taken sick- until he died. He was
afflicted with a loathsome disease and
was under treatment by Chinese doctors
about a month before he died. The last
time he called upon a doctor was on Feb
ruary 14. He was given some medicine,
which he carried home with him. A few
days before his death he took some of
this medicine. Vomiting tollowed almost
immediately, then he collapsed and died.
The board has no record of what this
medicine was.
The question of Inspecting the district
was then taken up. It was decided to
ipsue a call for volunteer medical men to
go through Chinatown inspecting every
one, but particularly determining exactly
the disease of every one found sick. To
that end the following call was written
out by Dr. Williamson:
To the Members of the Medical Profession:
The Board of Health is about to commence
ftn inspection of the Chinese" quarter for the
purpose of ascertaining the exact sanitary con
ditions and of taklnz steps to Improve , the
same. All cases of sickness are to be located
and their nature determined, and every effort
made to prevent the development and spread
Owing to lack of funds and the absolute
necessity! of having this Inspection made at
once, the board asks for volunteers among the
profession who may be. willing to -participate
In the work, and also asks all who are will
ing to render eucb 'service to call at the health
office and enroll their names, when they will
be assigned to duty by the health officer.
It was also decided that all employers
of Chinese should be warned of the sitÂ«
uation and urged to see that their help
keep away from Chinatown and that they
are in good health. Dr. Williamson is
sued the following notice:
TO EMPLOYERS OF CHINESE.
You are hereby advised that the Board of
Health Is about to make an Inspection of the
Chlnene quarter and may possibly find It neces
sary to place the district In quarantine. - You
are therefore requested to see that your Chi
nese help is free from illness, and I that they
are requested to refrain from visiting the Chi
nese quarter until further notice.
It was decided also to*ask the co-opera
tion of the Chinese Consul General for the
assistance of one hundred. reliable Chinese
who would go with the medical men and
assist them both to find the sick and ex
plain their errand to the inhabitants. The
matter of garbage was discussed and it
or whether it was the result of infection
from some disease center in the nlthy al
leys around the Chinese quarter.
History of the Case.
The history of the case was read, and
it revealed some peculiar facts, in tne
first place it showed that the man had
been sixteen years a resident of China
town and also that he had been sick for
six months. Inquiries made of Dr. Kln
youn after the meeting was over devel
oped the fact that when bubonic plague
once lays hold of a man it is but a short
time before the disease asserts itself.
Within thirty days the man is generally
either dead or convalescent. It is pos
sible the disease may run sixty days, but
in no case has It been known to run for
six months. Consequently it is plain the
man had not the plague when he was

FROM and after this date the matter
of keeping cool by the'frozen water
process will be a thing of no little
concern to those who have, found ice
the only solace for their greatest troubles.
, The iceman is now a nabob. He has
reached the pinnacle of his ambition and
entered Into a trust with his fellow, and
from to-day burning: humanity must pay
the price or suffer. The toll on ice has
been doubled.
Then think of the hardship to the In
dividual who has become addicted, to the
habit of reducing the circumference of a
swollen head by means of a- cake. of ice.
Like a drowning man who- grasps at a
straw, the swollen-headed individual will
consider himself lucky if he is able to
dampen his brow with a sliver from a
chunk of ice instead of cooling his cra
nium with a whole cake.
The soda-water girl and the rounder
who revels in champagne frappe will Join
hands in condemning the -iceman's trust.
Just think of warm soda water and tepid
champagne! If that is not argument
enough against the grinding combines
for the sake of coolness and comfort,
what more is wanted? '
With the increase in the price of ice
there is one individual who has the laugh
on those who will suffer by the trust. In
a single night the man with cold feet has
been resurrected from the realms of de
rision and scorn and placed on a pedestal
where all Â¦ may do him honor. He can
wink his eye, at the iceman, and heated
humanity may fight for the privilege of
cooling their parched - tongues .on his
frigid toes.
