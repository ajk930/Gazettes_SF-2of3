News of the Kntry of Lord Rob
erts' Army Into the Free State
Capital Is Expected at Any
Hour.
Rumors of the Relief of Mafeking Not Con
firmed and Serious Conditions Exist at
% That Beleaguered Town.
LONDON, March 14.â News of Lord Roberts* entering Bloemfontein is cow ex
pected at any hour. General French on Monday evening occupied tha
two hiUs commanding the town, two and a half miles to tha south of It- Ha
met opposition and was apparently unable to capture the railway station,
which it was important to take on account of the rolling stock found there.
Lord Roberts followed General French with the Third cavalry brigade and
counted infantry and the rest of the army were marching on Bloemfontein
yesterday, mo that, apparently, the commander In chief Is only waiting for the
Infantry to come up before moving into the Free State capital.
The s*ixnre of the railway will Isolate the Boer detachments still In the
south, facing Generals Clements and Gatacre. It la not thought likely that the
Boers will make any further attempt to contest the entrance Into Bloemfontein,
but wtH go eff to the northeast to protect the line to the Transvaal.
It was rumored yesterday that Mafekir.g had been relieved, but up to a late
boer last night the War Office was without any information confirming the re
port. The probability is that the town Is no longer severely besieged. Some re
ports paint the condition of the garrison and Inhabitants In dismal colors. They
are said to be subslftina: on horseflesh and horse fodder, with dysentery, typhoid
fever and diphtheria, epidemic. The defenders were holding cut on March 6 and
had defeated a. Boer attack a few days before.
The- passag-es of the Orange River at Norvals Pont and Bethulle bridge have
not yet been taken, but any day may bring the news 'that the Boers who have Â«
been watching the broken bridges have retreated. A reconnoissance by General
Clements Is probably a prelude to a turning movement.
From Lad-smith It Is reported that the main body of the Boer Natal army Is
holding B'ggarsbcrg In force.
ROBERTS' LOSSES ON

"I directed General French, if there -vaÂ«

The War Office received the following
additional ilepatch frcrn Lord Robert* at

"O*jr march rj; again unopposed. We
are now about eighteen mi!es from Bloera

"There are 21 men wounded and alwut

"Colcnel Umpheley has died cf hl^

Regiment was wounded severely. The
wounds are as a. rule, more serious than
usual, owing to the exr>an<iing bullets
which are freely n?e<l by the Boers."
FRANCE'S ATTITUDE

which It is said has been solicited by
President Kruger. The ofScla! in ques

"We believe it is true the Transvaal has

President Kruger's message has not been

In offering England mediation, neither

that in the present excited state of public

Government would defeat its own obj<?ct

"I had an hour's conversation with Mr.

happy solution of the great problem now

the details of that conversation. I ex

powers all look to this country to take
the initiative. If any European nation
should Intervene It would tend to destroy
the harmony of the continent. Most of

their motives would be questioned, but
the United States would have nothing to

States in transmitting the request did not urge that it be approved, and as it has
"not Indicated that It proposes to urge Great Britain to permit the use of Its good
offices. It his been saved from an affront such as it might have received had It
adopted the recommendation of pro-Boer agitators In the United Btates and with
out solicitation on the part of Great Britain urged that It accept the President's

In his dispatch "to the State Department setting forth the appeal Â«f President
Kruger to both the United Stales and Great Britain. Consul Hay referred to a
conversation he had had with the Boer author! tiea relative to the exercise of
the good offices of the United States. It was apparently the Idea of the Boer
Government that after the-acceptance of Great Britain -of - Its request and the
good offices of. the XTnited States be employed to end the war - there could be a
' discussion of 'terms, for they were not formally presented In the dispatch, for
warded on Sunday by Mr. Hay.
As stated, however. It is understood by the officials here that tho Boers
would bk glad to negotiate with Or*Â»at Britain far peace on the basis of their
complete Independence. â¢SRhich, however. Lord Salisbury has declined to consider.
It had been apparent to the officials acquainted with the temper of the British
officials that the British Government would not at this time accept peace; that
such negotiations would be confined to the military commanders of the hos
tile armies when the British were besieging Pretoria.
Montagu White, the unofficial representative ', of the Boer Government here-.
had not expected that the British Government would hearken to the appeals of
the Transvaal. He states, however, that the Boers are not beaten by any means
I yet, "and they will ' contest the advance of the British strenuously and will strong

ARREST OF MARK WESTLAKE and an Array of Evi
dence Against Him.
RENO, Nev., March 13.â 8hertff John
son of Sacramento last night-tele
graphed Sheriff Mclnnls of Reno
giving a description of Mark alias
William Westlake, who is wanted
In Sacramento for the murder of R. R
Watts, which was committed about the
20th of February. Sheriff Mclnnis and
Deputy Hayes scoured the town last
night, but only succeeded In ascertaining
that Westlake was working as a section
hand on the Southern Pacific road two
miles west of town. This morning J. J.
Hicter, Deputy Sheriff, arrived from Sac
ramento and accompanied Sheriff Mcln
nis to where Westlake was working and
arrested him. Westlake at first denied
his identity, but when taken before Man
ager James Welshon of the Riverside
Mills, who has known him for years, he
could no longer maintain his alias. West
lake came here ten days ago and regis
tered at the Clarendon Hotel as Billy
Brown. He applied to Manager Welshon
at the Riverside Mills for work, but got
nothing to do. Two days later he went to
work as a section hand on the railroad
and has worked there until this morning,
when he was arrested.
In his room at the Clarendon Hotel was
found a valise which the officers state
belonged to Watts, the murdered man,
and when arrested he was wearing a pair
of silk-topped graiters which a!*o belonged
to Wattf. The shoes were three sizes too
large for Westlake and had cotton stuffed
In the toes.
Wectlake was interviewed at the Coun
ty Jail to-night. He appeared to be quite
cheerful and ready to talk, but very reti
cent and evasive when pressed In regard
to exact dntes and points directly touch-
Ing the Watts case.
"I am not guilty, and that s all I can
pay," he said. "The last time I saw
Watts was in Sacramento on a Wednes
day night some time In February- I
could fix the date by looking it up. I
met him on the street. He said he was
poinjr to Fee a young fellow at the Pop
ular Restaurant ana wanted me to go
with him. I told him I would see him
later, and he went away. I never saw
him after that night. I do not know the
man's name at the Popular, but I could
find him in Sacramento. A day or two
after that the man at the employment
office a*ked me where Watts was. I told
him I did not know and asked him if he
had not se^n him.
"I worked the following Thursday and
Friday unloading coal in a coalyard in
Facramento, and on Saturday I went to
Chlco for a number of horses for the em
ployment agency man. I was away four
days. After I returned I came to Truckee,
a*id after one night there came here, and
in two days went to work on the section."
The officers suspected that he rode on
a pass stolen f rcm Watts, and in reply to
a question Westlake declared that he had
paid his fare and had no pass. His pos
session of the valise and shoes, that were
found in his room at the Clarendon and
which are" said to have been the property
cf Mr. Watts, ne explained by .saying that
he had bought them at a store In Marys Â«
vllle. but he could'not remember the name
of the store.
Questioned as to his relations with Mrs.
Martha Brauhard, Westlake declared that
he never knew her except by sight. She
used to come to the placer where he
stopped, but he never had any relations
with her. But be stated very positively
that he knew that Mrs. Brauhard and
her half-brothpr. Maxwell, or Bowen, lived
together as man and wife. Westlake de
nied that he had ever sold a gold watch
in Sacramento or that he had assumed
the name of. "W. R. Roberts," or signed
it to'any paper. Â¦ .' '. ' Â¦ .-â¢ ;':,
W. R.- Roberts was the name signed, to
the bill of sale of Watts' gold watch,
which it is presumed the murderer stole.-'
Westlake this afternoon signed an agree
ment to accompany Officer Hinter to Sac
ramento without the formality of a requi
sition, and they left for that city by, to
night's train, westlake claims to have no
relatives on the coast except his wife and
children, who live at 818 I street, Sacra
mento. He came from Henry County, Il
linois Â¦._ Â¦Â¦:Â¦. Â¦â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ .
WESTLAKE'S ACCOMPLICE
IGNORANT OF HIS ARREST
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 13. â Sheriff
Johnson has deemed it advisable to keep
!rom' Charles Brauhord for the present
:he fact that Mark Westlake, hla sup
posed accomplice, is under arrest. The
Sheriff has given the Jailers orders not to
>ermlt the two men to meet when "West
ake is brought down from Reno, Nev., to
norrow. â¢ â¢ ; - -
The "arrest of Westlake is regarded at.
>f the utmost importance. It. ls believed
hat Cooney, the. pawnbroker, will be able
:o -Identify him as the man from whom. he
purchased the watch, chain and nugget
pin of R. R. Watts, the, murdered miner,
rhe fact that Watts' boots and valise
urere found in Westlake's possession is of
:he most damaging significance taken in
;onnectlon with the finding of some of
Watts' clothing in Westlake's room in
Sacramento after his departure. No date
las as yet been fixed for the examina
tion of Brauhard, Odell and Mrs. Brau
lard.
The body of Watts was found on March
' by some boys who were playing on the
evee along the Sacramento -river. Inves
igation showed that he had been brutal
y murdered by having his brains dashed
>ut with a Jagged rock, which was found
lear the body, and that the murder had
)een ' accomplished some time before the
:rime was discovered.
Watts had been entangled in a mining
tcheme with Mrs. Brauhard. He had been
nduced by the woman to deed to her
:lghty acres of mining land in Shasta
bounty in return for which she trans
'erred to him an interest in her property
n Amador County. After Watts inspect
ed the Amador property he told the
voman that he would .not give her $2 50
lor all she had in Amador County. The
leal . was . consummated before Watts
nade an inspection of the -property she
;ransferred to him.
Mrs. Brauhard conducted an employ
ment agency in Sacramento and Watt*
had rooms over her place. .The woman
gained considerable notoriety recently, by
being arrested at' the instance of J. M.
Leeper. According to Mrs. Brau
nard had swindled him in a mining deal."
She caught him, as it was alleged she had
caught many, others, by the following ad
vertisement: â¢ â¢. .- ' ' â¢ ."'Â¦'â¢ ' â¢ "
A nice-looking;, respectable young widow, no
children, has large real estate and mining;
property, owns also a fine country home within
x short distance of Sacramento, wishes to be
come acquainted with an honest worklnÂ«man.
All letters answered. Intention, matrimony.
'. Mrs.^Brauhard's; plan was to first learn
If a suitor had money. If such was the
case he was permitted to take a share in
her mining property and then dig a. tun
nel in the hills looking for gold. Tho
depth of the tunnel dyg usually was in
proportion to the victim's love.
, Watts was a witness in Leeper's : case
against Mrs. Brauhard and the police of
Sacramento, acting on the theory that it
would be to Mrs. Brauhard's interest to
have Watts out of the way, held her on
the suspicion that she might know much
about the murder. For the same reason
the woman's husband Is still in prison,
while her partner In the employment -of
fice. .George Odell, was also arrested.
' Suspicion was first directed against
Westlake for the reason that he was very
friendly with both Mrs. Brauhnrd and her
husband and when his room was searched
aome of Watts' clothing was found in it.

ate to-day Kean of New Jersey resigned

Thurston of Nebraska from the Commit
tee on Railroads, Simon of Oregon from
the -Committee on the Potomac River

then appointed Bard of California to tne

ators had resigned in order to make com
mittee places for him.,
Â¦Personal explanations were made in the
Btnate by Allen of Nebraska and Butler
of North Carolina of their position on the
financial question. Both announced tbelr
belief in the free and unlimited coinage
cf silver at the ratio of 1C to 1. The bis te
nants were called out by reports o th*
contrary which had gained circulation*
Turner of Washington began an extend
ed speech on the Porto Rican bill. 'If*
maintained that the pending bill clrtirly
was unconstitutional, and Â«xprÂ«Â»ssed his
belief that it would be bo held if lt.w*re
passed upon by tbe Supreme Couru fie
ceclarrd its enactment would result 'n Vac
debauchery of our citizenship or of out
constitution. :_: _
He presumed that the minority in Con
press would be charged with favoring
competition of American working people
with the underfed and underpaid labor ol
Porto Rico and the Philippines; but In
ttals connection he said it would have tc
be remembered that the minority bad op
posed consistently the acquisition of th<
islands. Even now he believed the United
Etates ought to let the Philippines! go In
rx^ice " It ought to be the mlesion of this
country to rive them a start on the. road
tÂ» pood government and then permit
them to proceed for themselves, reserving
uuch ooailnx stations and harbors as we
mlg-ht need. If the commercial interests,
he said, must have their pound of flesh,
this country might make treaties with the
Filipinos affording us such advantages as
their *.ense of gratitude to the United
States might prompt them to give us.
Traditions Thrust Aside.
Turner thought the bill to levy a tariff
on the commerce between Porto Rico and
other portions of the United States was a
poor return for the ready acceptance of
our institutions on the part of the Porto
Ricans. and "no amount of sugar coating
could disguise Its evil smell or nauseating
taste." It was, to his mind, a desperate
assault upon the liberties of the people.
The evident purpose was to break down
the system which had stood the test of
123 years. The bill was clearly unconsti
tutional and -it was repugnant to every
utterance of the Supreme Court bearing
upon the subject:
Turner feared, indeed, that the meas
ure was one of those innovations against
which the fathers had warned the Ameri
can people, and he considered it wise to
stop and consider whither we were drift-
Ing. He did not agree with Foraker that
"we have passed the law-book stage,"
and quoted numerous decisions of the Su
preme Court to sustain his point, which
was that the constitution must apply
equally to all portions of the territory of
the United States and that there could
properly be no discrimination in favor of
one section in the matter of taxation or
otherwise In the interest of another sec
tion.

years, claiming that the promises made in
the last national campnign had been ful
filled. He said: "The Philippines belong
to us as truly as does this little â¢ State,"
and added: ."The conclusion is unavoid

CURRENCY BILL
EXPLAINED BY
SECRETARY GAGE
Intent of the Measure Which
Is About to Become
a Law.
All Forms of Money Issued or Coined
to Be Kept at a Parity "With the
Gold Standard off ;â¢
Value*
' . Â¦ - ' . Â¦ Â¦
WASHINGTON, March 13.â Secretary
Gage to-day made a statement in explana
tion of the provision of the financial bill
that passed the House, in which he says:
The financial bill, which now only _ awaits
the signature of the President to become a law,
has for its first object what, its title Indicates,
the fixing of the standard of value and the
maintaining at a parity with that standard of
all forms of money Issued or coined by the
United States.- It reaffirms that the unit of
value is the dollar, consisting of twenty-five
and eight-tenths grains of gold nine-tenths
fine, but from that point It goes on to make it
the duty of the Secretary of â¢ the Treasury to
maintain all forms of money Issued or coined
at a parity with this standard. It puts into
the hands of the Secretary ample power to do
that. *
For that purpose the bill provides In ' the
Treasury Bureaus of Issue and - Redemption,
and transfers from the general fund of the
Treasury's cash $150,000,000 in gold coin and
bullion to the redemption fund, that gold tq be
usod for the redemption of United States notes
and Treasury notes.- That "fund Is henceforth
absolutely cut out of and i separated' from Â« the
cash balance In the Treasury, i and the avail
able cash ' balance will' hereafter 'show- tC re
duction of $150,000,000 from the figures -that have
heretofore prevailed. This $150,000.000 ' redem
ption fund Is to be used for no other purpose,
than the redemption of the United States notes
and Treasury ; notes, and . these notes so re
deemed may be exchanged for gold in the gen
eral fund or with the public, -so that the re
serve fund is kept full with gold to the $150,
000,000 limit.
: }. f " Power . to Sell \ Bonds. Â¦Â¦â¢ ": ;Â¦ â¢
The Secretary is given . further : power. . If
redemptions go. on so that the gold) in this re-*
serve fund is reduced to bÂ»low 1100,000.000 and
be Is unable to. build up to the $150,000,000 mark,
by exchange for . gold - In . the general fund tor
otherwise, -he is, given power to sell bonds, and
It Is made his duty to' replenish "the gold to the
$150,000,000 mark by such means.-'. 'Â¦â¢"Â¦"- ';â¢ .
', The "endless chain" 'is' broken' by a provision
which 'prohibits the use ' of .:â¢ notes so redeemed
t<>( meet deficiencies in the current revenues.
The act provides for the ultimate retirement of
all the Treasury notes ! issued in payment for
silver bullion under the Sherman act.. As 'fast i
as the bullion Is coined into' silver dollars
Treasury notes are to be retired and replaced
with an equal amount of silver certificates.
The measure authorizes the Issue of gold cer- .
tlflcates in exchange for deposits of gold coin,
the same as at present, but suspends that au
thority whenever -and- so long us the gold In
the redemption fund is below $100,000,000. and
KlvÂ«s to the Secretary â¢ the option to suspend
the Issue of such certlflcirtes whenever the sli
ver certificates and United States notes in the
general fund of the Treasury exceed $60,000,000.
The bill provides for a larger Issue of silver
certificates, by declaring that hereafter * sliver
certificates shall be issued only In denomina
tions of Â»10 and under, except as to 10 per cent
of the total volume. Room Is made for this I
larger use of silver certificates In the way of
small bills by another provision which makes
It necessary, as fast as the present silver cer
tificates of high denominations are broken up
Into small bills, to cancel a similar volume of
United States notes of small denominations,
and replace them with notes of denominations
of $10 and upward. Further room is made for
thÂ« circulation of small silver certificates by
a clause which permits national banks to have
only one-third of Â¦ their capital in denomination
under $10. ,Â¦ _ '.;. .:
Subsidiary'; Silver Coin.
I One clause which the public will greatly ap
preciate is the right that It given to the Secre
tary to coin any of the . 1890 bullion into sub
sidiary silver coin up to a limit of $100,000,000.
There has for years been a scarcity of sub
sidiary sliver during, periods of active retail
trade, but this provision will give the treas
ury 1 ample opportunity to supply all the sutn
sldiary silver thafts needed. Another provision
that the public will greatly appreciate Is the
authority given to the Secretary to recota worn
and uncurrent subsidiary silver now in * the
treasury or hereafter received. The bill makes
a continuing appropriation for paying the dif
ference .between -the face value of 'such coin
and the amount the same will produce . in . the
new coin. . <-'Â¦' â¢Â¦"Â¦-â¢- Â¦"Â¦â¢Â¦ - Â¦ â¢.::'Â¦ "â¢,,'Â¦'Â¦: -
A distinct feature of the bill is In reference
to refunding the 8 per cent Spanish war. loan,
the 2 per cent bonds maturing in 1907 and the
6 per cent bonds maturing in J'jM, a total of
$539,000,000, Into new 2 per cent. bonds. These
new i per cent bonds .will not be offered for
sale, but will only be Issued In exchange for
an equal amount, if aÂ«e value, of old bonds. \
The holders of old bonds will receive a-pre
mium In cash to compensate them' ln a measure
for the sacrifice of interest which they, make.
The cash premium will be computed on a basis
of the present worth -of the old bonds at 2"Â£
per cent and will be, on April l.'the date that
the. new 2 per cent bonds will bear,' $106.6851 for
the 3's. $111.6766 tor the 4' s. and $110. 0751 "for
each $100 of the 6' s. -This exchange will save
the Government," after deducting the premium
paid, nearly $23,000,000, If all the holders of the
old . bonds exchange â¢ them for the â¢ new 'Â¦ ones.
National banks that take out. circulation based
on the new bonds are to be taxed' only one-half
of 1 per cant on. the average amount of circu
lation - outstanding,- while those ! who have . cir
culation based on a deposit of old bonds will
be taxed.' as at present.".. 1: per } cent. Â¦..â¢Â¦ \
Increase of Bank Circulation.
There; are some * other Â¦'. chanjres In. the na
tional I banking- act.' - The law permits the na
tional banks with $25,000 capital to be organized
In places of 3000 Inhabitants or less, whereas,
heretofore, 'the minimum capital^ has- been $50,-
COO. 'It also permits banks to issue circulation
of â¢ all â¢ classes * of Â« bonds -. deposited ? up ; to ' the
par value of the bonds. Instead of 90 per <JÂ«nt
of , their face value, as r heretofore. This 'ought
to . make <an Immediate increase -in < national

PEACE SEEMS
NEAR AT HAND
IN KENTUCKY
Legislature of the Blue Grass
State Adjourns Sine
Die.
Democrats and Republicans Agree to
Refrain From Violence Until
the Courts Shall Have
Acted.
FRANKFORT. Ky., March 13.â The
Legislature of Kentucky adjourned sine
die to-day. A conference between Adju
tant Generals Collier and Castleman re
sulted In a perfect understanding being
reached. Governor Taylor will continue
to act as Governor. Governor Beckham
will. make r.o move toward obtaining pos
t-ession of the State buildings until the
Court of Appeals has decided the matter.
The Legislature appropriated SIOO.OOO for
ihe use of Governor Beckham in reorgan
izing the State militia. The debate on the
bill in the Hou.se naturally took on a
strong partisan tinge, but it went through
amid wild cheers by a vote of 63 to 15,
most of the Republicans refusing to vote.
It was explained by the Democratic lead
ers on the floor that the fund would not
be used until after the decision of the
Court of Appeals. The bill is regarded as
a "war fund" by the Democrats.
Among the more conservative element
In each party the opinion prevails that the
worst is ovwr and that when the Court of
Appeals renders its decision the danger
cf civil war In the commonwealth, which
has been terribly imminent, will have
passed away entirely. To the Democratic
leaders, with a full understanding of the
situation, only one cloud appears on the
political horizon, and that is Governor
Taylor's future course.
Taylor Refuses to Talk.
Governor Taylor himself will not outline
his plan of action beyond the statement
which he made to-day, that he would
"continue to act as Governor." Republi
cans in Governor Taylor's confidence,
however, say that he will remain at
Frankfort in the discharge of his duties
until the court of last resort passes upon
the question at issue. Then, if the de
cision be against him. he will step out at
once and turn over the State buildings to
Governor Beckham. The Republicans will
make every effort to carry the dispute
into -the Federal courts in case the-de
cision of the Court of Appeals and the Su
preme Court of Kentucky is against
them, but, failing in this, they will con-
Eider the question settled, stfll believing
a great wrong has been done them. -
The Democratic leaders assert that they
will cheerfully abide by the decision of the
Court of Appeals. But. should the deci
sion be in their favor, they will insist on
the occupancy of the State buildings,
"peaceably if possible, but forcibly if
necessary," as it was expressed to-day.
Not until that decision is rendered will
further action be taken.'
THREATENED ARREST
OF SENATOR DEBOE
WASHINGTON. March 13.â A rumor
was current at the Capitol to-day that
a warrant was to be Issued for the arrest
of Senator Deboe of Kentucky for alleged
complicity in the assassination of Mr.
Goebel. The Senator said the mere sug
gestion of such a thing was ridiculous.
He attended two of the conferences held
by the Republican leaders of Kentucky
to formulate a policy to be followed in
defending Governor Taylor's right to the
Governorship, but paid that at neither of
these was there any talk of violence to
Mr. Goebel.
FRANKFORT. March 13.â Gabriel A.
Taul of Hardinburg- was brought to
Frankfort to-night In the custody of the
Sheriff of Breckinridge County. He was
arrested to-day for supposed complicity
in the assassination of Governor Goebel.
The Sheriff and the pollcr officials here
refuse to give out any Information In re
gard to the arrest. It is learned, how
ever, that Taul was not in Frankfort at the
time of the shooting and it is said that
his connection with the crime is only in
direct. Taul was not taken to jail, but
spent the night at the Capitol Hotel in
charge of an, officer.

William Henry Is Seriously Injured
at Pinole and Several Workmen
Have Narrow Escapes
From Death.
â¢-*
. Spe:lal Dispatch to The Call. '
PINOLE. March 13.â At this place to
day, where the San Francisco and San
Joaqutn Valley Railway crosses the coun
ty road, occurred. a disastrous smash-up,
which resulted in the serious injury of
William Henry and the narrow escape
from death of a large number of work
men. "Â¦" '
A temporary bridge had been construct
ed and the rails laid up to that point so
as to allow the transportation of heavy
steel material necessary to construct a
permanent bridge. Two flatcars holding
two immense girders were standing on
the bridge and the men were busy ad
justing the tackle to lower the girders
into position when, with hardly. a mo
ment's warning, three heavily laden flat
cars rushed out of the long cut and col
lided with the cars on the bridge. Will
iam Henry was caught beneath the
wreckage and had his leg broken and was
otherwise severely j injured. When the
cars struck the last of tnose which had
run away broke loose and rebounded fully
two hundred yards, but still held the
rails. All four of the remaining cars were
completely wrecked and one large girder
weighing twenty-seven tons was knocked
down to the road leaving one end restlns?
on the bridge.
The accident was caused by three cars
breaking loose from a construction train,
seven miles from the scene of the wreck.
A gang cf men were distributing cross
arms for the telegraph line from the cars,
and when the train reached the top of
the grade and commenced to descend the
other side it was discovered that the
three head cars had broken from the
train. They were soon beyond the con
trol of the trainmen.' There were no
brakes on the three cars and the' men who
were on them wore powerless. After
making efforts to check' the cars by
throwing ties in front of the wheels they
were compelled to abandon them. 7he
men followed as fast as they could, well
knowing that there would be a disaster.
The great derricks used in placing the
steel girders for the bridge were com
pletely demolished, and a number of. per
sons who were near the bridge had nar
row escapes from being caught under the
wreck. Captain Bermingham had barely
passed under the bridge with- his team
when the crash came.
It will be several days before the wreck
will be cleared owing to the great diffi
culty in getting apparatus sufficiently
powerful to move one of the immense
girders now lying on, the cars, which are
too badly disabled to be moved. .All lay
ing of rail beyond this point toward Point
Richmond has ceased.
Porto Rico had come Into the United
States. He said that there was no need
to fear that In extending the constitution
over Porto Rico It would mean like ac
tion when legislation for the Philippines
: was under consideration. Bach island
and group should be and would be dealt
with separately and Independently. It
would be time to consider the Philippines'
tariff when it was reached.
Supported by Perkins.
Senator Aldrlch did not take any par
ticular? side, but counseled ; action which
would: unite ' the Republican majority.
Senator Â¦ Perkins, as well as other mem
bers of the Porto Rican committee, want
ed? the, bill agreed upon without compro
tnlse or amendment. Quite a number of
Senators in this connection expressed the
opinion that a majority would vote for the
bill as reported and took occasion to crit
icise the, unstable policy which was being
pursued, saying that the constant chang
ing - had done more to shake the ' faith
of the country than anything else.
â¢ Senator Simon of Oregon, whose posi
tion was not known, went further than
any other Senator In declaring his un
alterable position in favor of free trade
with Porto Rico. He said that we had no
right to tax our dependencies and that if
we did not infend to treat new acquisi
tions as we treated other acquired tern
tory we should not retain them. He-saw
no menace to labor, manufacturing or
agriculture In free trade with the Islands,
but a promise of far greater Increase of
Â¦ Senator Mason also took strong ground
in favor of free trade with the islands if
they were to be retained as a possession
or part of the United States. He said the
trouble was not with Porto Rico, but with
the Philippines. This could be averted
easily by announcing our determination
not to hold the Philippines, but to grant
them the freedom which many of them
sought, and assist them to form a stable
government. It would not be difficult
then to enter Into satisfactory trade rela
tions with them and our. laboring men
would not then be threatened with cheap
Malay labor, which, he said, seemed to be
troubling a great many advocates of the
present tariff. .-.
Senator Spooner .urged party harmony,
and believed that the Senators could find
some common ground upon which dif
ferences could be adjusted. He was for
the committee bill, as was also Senator
Hale, who- spoke against what he said
were the dangers lurking In our attempt
ing to control and to legislate for the dis
tant Islands of. the Pacific.
WASHINGTON. March 13.â The
Republican Senators were In
caucus for two and a' half
hours on the Porto Rican bill
this afternoon, and at 6 o'clock
adjourned until 2 o'clock to-morrow, when
the discussion will be resumed. : No vote
was taken upon any of the various propo
sitions laid before the caucus, but as a
result of the caucus talk the impression
prevailed that' there was a great deal of
opposition to the bill, which opposition, if
It were not placated, might endanger ltd
passage. It was also apparent that a
numbor of other Senators thought the
legislation was ill-advised,. but, while op
posed to the bill, would vote for it as a
party measure.
Deep feeling was displayed over the
question by a number of Senators, and
especially by those of the Middle West,
some of whom did not hesitate to affirm
that any effort to place a tariff upon the
exchange of business between the United
States and Porto K*co probably would
have an injurious effoct upon the Repub
lican party in these States.
An Agreement Expected.
There were some sharp passages atarms
It was generally agreed, however, that
from a party standpoint almost any bill
was betier than none, and this feeling
gave the friends of the .measure- hope,
despite the apparently unyielding attitude
of the. opposing factions. They are still
holding to the bill as originally introduced
und express the belief that it will form
the basis of whatever settlement is agreed
upon. This opposition is based upon what
-was said in a general way and not upon
any poll of. the, caucus, for there ' was
nothing approaching a vote during the
caucus. One indication that an agree
ment to-morrow is expected is the con
tinued determination of the Cuban sub
committee to leavo here to-morrow for a
tour of Cuba.
Those Senators who favored the propo
sition for a tariff on Porto Rican goods
coming into this country and free trade
for goods going to Porto Rico said that
this course would be humane in princi
ple, since it would afford free entry of
food and supplies needed by the Porto
Ricans, while the tariff on goods coming
into this country would- supply revenue
for the island and retain the principle or
protection. Â«â¢
Several tln-.es during the debate the
course of Â¦ the administration was men
tioned and the statement made .that the
country was aroused -.because it had
seemed that Congress .: was acting con
trary to the wishes of the President. Sev
eral Senators asserted that the President
was now anxious for the proposed : tariff
of 15 per cent.
Senator Foraker talked at considerable
length and vigorously supported the bill,
and was expressly, determined" that " the
governmental features should not ,be
abandoned. He also defended the tariff
provisions as being of advantage Instead
of a hardship upon, the people Â¦of Porto
Rico. He declared that the bill as amend
ed by the committee, levying a 15 per cent
duty on products both ways, was the best"
measure that could- be; passed, but said
he was willing to accept the compromise
levying a duty only on Porto Rican pro
ducts coming to this country. !
Hanna Favors the Bill.
Senator Hanna made a speech that was
listened to with great interest. He fa
vored the House bill, and especially the
tariff provisions. He said â¢ that from a
party view the tariff ought to remain.
This was a Republican Congress and
there should be Republican legislation. If
the bill were. 'defeated, he- asserted, it
would hand the legislation over to the
Democrats. He spoke of the effect a free
trade measure would have upon the work
ingmen, who feared the-effect should the
policy of free trade with the Philippine
Islands be- established by granting free
trade to Porto Rico. He urged the Re
publicans to stand firmly, together for the
bill. ...
Senator Proctor of .Vermont said that he
believed in -ââ¢ free, trade with . Porto Rico,
and thought the matter could be adjusted
by leaving a miliitary Governor and not
attempting either a civil government or
tariff legislation at the present time.
Senator . Fairbanks deplored the situa
tion and expressed hope that there might
be some adjustment. He said there was
no question as to the feeling of the peo
ple in his State, who were for free trade
with Porto Rico.
Senator Davis, who recently Introduced
an -amendment extending that portion of
the constitution relative to taxation over
the island, made quite an extended
speech, taking strong grounds In favor of
free trade with Porto Rico. He said it
was not because the tariff would keep
out or let in certain products that Con
gress should act. but because the almost
universal sentiment of the people should
be heededâ a sentiment' which he said
had. been kindled by the manner in which
Republican Senators Spend Another Day in a
Fruitless Attempt to Arrive at an Agree
ment on the Measure.

BOXERS TO MEET
IN THE ARENA
Stelzner and Joe Butler of

Aurelio Herrera . and t Crockey Boyle,
the Crack Lightweights, to Pro
vide Preliminary â Butler
and Boyle Favorites.
Two heavy-weight boxers. Jack St'elzner
t>f this cltyand Joe B.utler,of Philadelphia,
will meet, to-night in the arena of "thq Na
tional Athletic Club, Woodward's Pavilion,
in a 'twenty-round bant. The clash of arms
between heavy-weights has always proved
attractive to the patrons of the sport in
this city, so that a large attendance is ex
pected. Stelzner is well known 'in- this
city, having been the boxing: partner of
Corbett, FitzslmmonsJ Sharkey and others
of the heavy-weight _ division. He has
taken a lot of punishment and has never
been knocked out.
Butler has met a -lot of the bis: men,
and Is, the only. boxer, who ever knocked
out, Ed Dunkhorst. who has been serving
Sharkey for some time In the arduoun po
sition of boxing partner. Butler has met
Peter Jackson when the latter was in his
prime, Frank Slavin, Peter Maher, Joe
Choynskl and others. He has the reputa
tion of being a bustling. fighter, who is al
ways busy and aggressive. - The bettors
have installed him a 10 to 7 favorite in the
straight betting and he Is also favorite In
the mutuels, the greater number of tick
ets having ,been sold on him. To win hand
ily from a boxer like Stelzner ""hre r must
show form of the highest class.
: The â¢ preliminary bout is attracting al
most as much attention as the main event.
Aurelio Herrera, the young boxer from
the San Joaquin Valley, makes his debut
here, as does "Crockey" Boyle, his op
ponent. The former has a long list of vic
tories to his credit, the majority helus;
won decisively in : short order. He Is -an
exceptionally hard . hitter and generally
retires his opponent before they have gon<?
a- half-dozen rounds. Boyle Is said to shine
as a defensive fighter. It'being' hard for
any one to put a glove on him.. He has
left nothing undone that would send him
Into the ring in first-class condition. He
is favorite in the betting at 10 to 7.
Jack Welch will referee both bouts.

JOHN COLEMAN, bookmaker and

Santa Catalina islands with a record that
Is the envy of fishermen. T\Tiile out In a
launch fishing the deep sea for rock cod
he landed a shark of the real blue variety
that was the largest caught near the
islands during the last five years. This
U not a.nsh story, but a tale of sea ad
venture properly authenticated by the
testimony of three competent and cred

In the early part of last week Coleman
started out for. a day with the drop line.
Behind the launch from which he fished
was a row boat of small pattern. After
pulling in dozen after dozen of cod three
miles from shore Coleman noticed a-sud.

launch. A moment after a big blue shark
appeared at the surface. Coleman was
drawing In his line at the time and the
shark arose from the depths of the sea,
following the small rock cod that were
dangling on the fisherman s tackle. _ _
The boatman who was with Coleman
quickly baited some tuna fishing tackle
which he had with him and gave It to the
ardent sportsman to catch the shark. In
a few seconds Coleman, rod in hand, ex
cited the curiosity of the sea monster, a nd
the bait was swallowed with a portion of
the line. Drawing in the line, Coleman
after a long battle worked the shark to
ward the launch, and when. striking dis

the gill. Both men were .then in a quan

catch. The lift from the .water -to the
gunwale of the launch was too hign, as
the fish weighed more than 300 pounds.
A. young lady who was ~> with the 'party
came to their assistance and drew the

straining every -effort boatman and
sportsman finally succeeded in drawing
the big. shark into the. row boat.
No time was lost that afternoon in fur
ther fishing for cod, but the party turned
homeward. -iColeman was so elated over
hiÂ» -capture that every photographer on
the "bench was brought into. active em
ployment -and a wine dinner was the final
act in the great capture.
The shark -lacked a few inches of ten
feet in length. and weighed more than 300
pounds. Coleman has the jaws as an or
nament to the parlor mantel of his homa,
Trout for the South.
The California Fish Commission Is pre
paring to plant a large number of trcut
fry In the streams of the southern part of
the State this fall. The reason that so
much attention is to be paid to that sec
tion of the country is that during the past
two years there has been a scarcity of
rain and the streams have suffered, to the
great injury of the fish. The fry is to be
taken from the Shovel Creek hatchery,
which will be operated to its full capacity
this spring. The commission is also po
eratlng two hatcheries on Lake Tahoe and
one on the Truckee River, which are ex
pected to yield largely this season. The
open season for trout begins on the Ist of
next month, and the reports from many
localities give promise of fine sport for the
lovers. of rod and reel.
MAY W CAUSES
TROUBLE FOR
ANOTHER RIDER
Judges Suspend Buchanan
for Finishing Third With
the Sprinter.
>
Four Beaten Choices at Tanforan
Park â Flamora Nosed Out the
Heavily Played Ventoro.
Topmast Scored.
Â»
TVhpn May, W won the final event on
the card at Tanforan on Monday it could
be termed a "scratch." for had Sardine
been away on equal terms with the Cal
gary mare Corrigan's three-year-old
would have galleped in first. Don Cam
eron started May W back in the seven
furlong number yesterday, for which
Geyser was Â¦withdrawn and Ventoro
p!ur.ge<l on. Ja<-k Martin, astride Fla
mora.. nosed the good thing out, while
May W brought up an Indifferent third.
The last named mare acted sour and
cranky at the poet, and Monday's run
6howed her to be pounds below true form.
The judÃt-s vtere of the opinion that Bu
chanan put up a listless riae (and possi
bly he. did), "indefinitely suspending the
your.g rider. Once before Buchanan was
ruled off. lÂ»it Inexperience was pleaded
and he was reinstated.
Followers- of favorites in the betting ex
perienced some rough weather, as Af
ghan anU Topmast w<-re the only success
ful inff. There were two or three very
close finishes, all of which were decided
to the entire satisfaction of the crowd.
None of the short priced ones were able
to get a mark in the two-year-old prram
h\e. the favorite, Carilee. finishing fourth.
Floranthe. a 50 to 1 phot ridden by Hen
fon. turned up a handy winner, chased
in by Too Hot and Princess Leota, two
very rank outsiders.
Corrigan's Afghan, with Henry In the
eaddle and a 5 to 2 favorite, defeated a
bunch of nine in the six-furlong run which
followed. The chestnut horse made all
the running, winning with comparative
ease from Momentum. Show honors went
to Vioris.
Waiter Jennings' statuesque filly.
Flower of Gold, received heavy backing
to beat Erwin in the mile for three-year
olds. She led to the stretch, where the
Shinies colt headed her, and had some
thing left at the close. Norford. big and
lumbering as usual, just managed to get
the show from Mortgage.
Al Shaw shot the mile and a quarter
run away with Twinkler. Johnny Camp
bell's horse, at one time 8 to 1, was much
the best, but Shaw succeeded In getting
cut off half a dozen times, finishing a fast
coming third. By superior jockeyship,
Piggott landed Topmast, the favorite,
winner over Chimura by a nose.
In the last number, a mile purse run,
Shaw, astride El Mldo. led from start to
finish. Acrobat, the favorite, ran second,
two lengths ahead of Cromwell.

The Sunset Improvement Club, voicing

ers for the privilege of using the rcuth
drive as an accommodation . outlet for
teams and vehicles delivering goods, etc
to the people. As it Is now, Hstrce" Is
not In proper condition for general traffic
and as a consequence the drivers of 'earns
Into the Sunset Valley are compelled to

were permitted to use the southern drlva
from Ninth avenue to Stanyan street .
A committee from this club has also
waited on Superintendent Vlnlng looking
for a better car service in the Interest of
the many laboring men engaged !n the
park. The need for this is made moro ap

the city have betn placed under the.con
trol of the Park Commissioners." This ad

to . get to their places of : employment* at
regular hours, whereas heretofore they
could walk to.the park in time for duty.

LITTLE BLANCHE TRELEASE. seven
years of age. Is the latest aspirant for
stage honors, and if the opinons of
critics count, there is no doubt of her
success as a clever character imperson
ator. The child's versatility is most re
markable and her impersonation true and
lifelike. In the "Brownies in Fairyland"
the little one will show to advantage in
her laughable Chinese Imitations, songs
and dances.
Offers for the . professional stage have
poured in on Miss Trelease, but It has
been decided that she will devote another
year to study before doing any regular
professional work. Little Blanche will
make her first appearance to-morrow af
ternoon in the "Brownies" at the Califor
nia Theater. -".-';
HYDROGRAPHIC
OFFICE IS TO
BE CONTINUED
Congress Reconsiders Its
Determination to Cut
Expenses.
The Call's Effort to Protect San Fran-
Cisco's Shipping Interests Is
Crowned With Complete
Success.
In the bill which ia regularly Introduced
in Congress making appropriations for
the Hydrographic Office there was in
troduced this year a clause that said "no
expenditure shall be Incurred or author
ized for personal service, or otherwise, un
der the Hydrographic Office during the
fiscal year 1901 except as herein author
ized by appropriations under the Navy
Department, or under appropriations that
may be made for printing and binding."
In other words the running expenses- of
the Hydrographic Office were to be so cut
down that it would have been impossible
to pay the salaries and other expenses
necessary for maintaining the branch of
fices ln the different seaport cities
throughout the United States.
These offices are of great importance'
and the aid they afford to safe naviga
tion cannot be too highly estimated It
appeared that the reduction of the ap
propriation, which would have amounted
to something over $84,000, was a measure
of false economy, which would have cost
the country far more than that sum" in
the long run, through the losses our ship
ping would suffer, deprived of the Infor
mation collected through the help of the
branch Hydrographic Office in this city.
The Call, readily enlisted itself In the
effort to secure â¢ the restoration of the
necessary appropriation, so that the office
here might be continued and the seafar
ing interests in and out of San Francisco
be afforded the much-appreciated help it
has always received. How well The Call
succeeded ln.its effort Â¦ will' be seen, by
the following telegram, which was re
ceived last night: ;
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 13. 1900.
John D. Spreckels, San Francisco Call
San Francisco. Cal.: Appropriation for
HydtOKraphlo Office restored and restric
tions of payment for personal services re
moved by Senate Committee on Â¦ Appropria
tions ln appropriation bill reported to the
6enate to-day. GEORGE L. SHOUP.
United States Senator.
. This means that the Hydrographic Of
fice In this city will be continued as usual
under the direction of Lieutenant Calk
ins, the same who stood on the bridge
with Dewey when the famous fight in Ma
nila Bay was made and won. and that the
shipping interests of the Pacific Coast will
not in the future be deprived of any of
the safeguards they have had to protect
them In. the, past.

CLEVER, CHILD

.Hep Character Impersona
tions Jlpe Said to Be
Truly Remarkable.
WILLIE'S GUN NEARLY
BROKE UP THE SHOW
He Mystified the Trainers, Worried
the Ponies and Got Himself Into
Serious Trouble.
' A small boy with a slingshot came vÂ«ry
near breaking up tho performance of Nor
ris & Rowe's Dig trained animal shew at
Mechanics' Pavilion last night, and there
by disappointing the thousands of iieopla
who had congregated to witness the per
formance.
The boy, whose name is "Willie Brown,
purchased a 10-cent ticket and took a seat
on a rafter In the gallery. He had with
him a slingshot end a pocket full of buck
shot. Everything went well until Mr.
Rumley. the equestrian director, entered
the ring with his twelve Shetland ponie*
to put them through the military drill.
The ponies lined up nicely at the com
mand of Mr. Rumley. and then suddenly
they began to kick and run and Jo ail
sorts of things not on the programme.
Try as he may. he could do nothing with
the ponies. Finally, as a last resort, ha
attached a rope to the ponies, the same
as if he. were training them, and tried to
get them to go through the drill, but to no
avail. Mr. Rumley turned red, mopped
his forehead and gave up In despair.
Finally Mr. Norris was called in. but ha
could do no more than Mr. Rumley.
Â¦ The small boy in the gallery was tha
cause of the trouble. He had hit
rllngshot working all the time, like a re
peating rifle, on the ponies, and his aim
was excellent. One of the shot from the
gallery hit Mr. Norrls on the arm. and
then the cause of the trouble was learned.
Officer Hook was sent to the gallery and
the young culprit was taken to the office,
where his Implements of destruction wcr<*
taken from him and a good spankin? ad
ministered by the officer, who then sent
him home.
Had not the shot hit Mr. Norris no doubt
the audience would have had to be dis
missed, as the little animals were terribly
confused. Mr. Norrls says that this was
the first experience of the kind ha has
encountered during* his career of seven
teen years before the public He sayn Wil
lie Brown has a wonderful Idea of mis
chief.
Sudden Death of Dennis O'Brien.
Dennis O'Brien, a laborer, 65 years old,
was found dead yesterday morning on the

street. He had been subject to epileptic
fits and his death is. supposed to have
been caused from natural causes. An in
quest will be held.

WHY GALLAGHER HIT
MARTINE ON THE JAW
Incidents of a Fight in the Oberon
Belated to Judge Mogan and a
Decision Reserved. ' '
The mistake made by Joseph Martlne
and Dr. D. Kennet, proprietors of tfce
Oberon, last Saturday in attacking James
Gallagher, a piano-mover, was related to
Judge Mogan yesterday, Gallagher having
been arrested on a charge of battery
The evidence showed that.. Gallagher
went to the Oberon, accompanied by
James ODea, and presented an order from
his employers for a piano. Kennet told
him that he could not get it and if he did
not go out he would be kicked out. Gal
lagher replied that Kennet had better
think it over. Martlne then chimed in
and said that If Kennet wouldn't kick
Gallagher out he would. Gallagher made
the same reply to Martine, and Martine
swung for Gallagher's head, but did riot
land. Gallagher was more fortunate and
landed on Martlne's jaw.
Gallagher had to dodge beer glasses for
a couple of minutes, and made for t>e
lunch counter to get crockery to defend
himself. He grabbed hold of a pickle bot
tle,, but ODea advised him to quit =*nd
they left the place. Just as they went out
of the door Martine shouted: "If you come
back here I'll shoot you on the spot." The
Judge after hearing the testimony re

THE attorneys for tha respondents
In Mrs. Craven-Fair's litigation
against the Fair estate, now on
trial before Judge /Troutt. gave
very strong indications yesterday
as to the line of their defense. The man
ner In which they handled the cross-ex
amination of Mrs. Purcell, the dress
maker, or, as she terms herself, "mo
diste," in connection with the bold asser
tion that they would prove the marriage
contract to be a forgery, reached almost
the point of accusing the constructor 1 of
women's garments of being a penwoman.
Mrs. Craven-Fair's New Witness.
When Mr. Pierson exhausted his list of
Questions calculated to mix the mind of
the "modiste" the petitioner Introduced
a new witness in the person of H. M.
Bryant, a migratory individual, who shied
at the Intimation that he was Interested
in "schemes" but proudly proclaimed
himself a "promoter." His evidence did
not fit together very well and on some
points he was so positively strong as to
he extremely harmful to the interests of
Mrs. Craven-Fair's case. For example,
he was positive he became acquainted
with Fair in San Francisco during ISSS,
and no amount of Interrogation had the
effect of making him waver from the as
sertion. Under cross-examination he ivas
equally positive that he never set foot
on the soil of the Pacific Slope until IS9L
Exhibition of Penmanship.
Mrs. Purcell's account books were pro
duced in court during the morning ses
sion. Mr. Pierson discovered entries
in them In both large and small
handwriting and was anxious to learn
which style of chirography the witness
was accustomed to employ. She could
not tell.
The attorney undertook to get some up
to-date samples of 'her penmanship and
had her write names and sentences and
the bodies of documents that apparently
have a very important bearing on the
litigation. â¢
A Shot at Expert Kytka.
Just before she undertook the penman
ship exhibition Attorney Lafe Pence shied
a chunk of sarcasm at Writing Expert
Kytka. requesting that he be instructed
by the court to watch the witness write,
so he could not testify later on that the
samples of penmanship were not hers.
Plerson wanted only specimens of pencil
writing. He had Mrs. Purcell write
"James G. Fair," "Nettle R. Craven,"
"Margaret Craven" and the number
"ISTU." Then he had her copy on two
blanks the written portions of the famous
pencil deeds. This had gone on for some
time without interruption from Pence.
Finally Mrs. Craven-Fair's attorney de
cided it was time to be doing something,
and interposed an objection to further
writing ty Mrs. Purcell unless the re
spondents would indicate the purpose of
that line of examination. McEnerney re
plied that he would define his side of tbÂ«
case when he reached it and did not feel
called upon to do It before.
Declares Contract a Forgery.
Pence was persistent, and McEnerney
strained a point and answered him.
"We always have claimed, we do claim
now and will establish before this . trial
is over that the marriage contract is a
forgery." was the Fair attorney's decla
ration.
"Then we withdraw our objection,"
announced Pence, and the examination in
writing continued.
On redirect examination Pence a^kii
Mrs. Purcell if she had forged the con
tract or the pencil deeds or the pencil
will, and she replied with a laugh that
she had not. Pence also wanted souin
Eamplea of the witness* handwriting, but
it was the pen and ink variety that he
sought. The first sentence he had her
write was:
""How many pruesses does it take for an
expert to tell the truth?"
TCytka flushed a bit at th*Â» shot. The
witness wrote from Pence's dictation the
section of the trust will which provides
that any legatee contesting shall 'orfeit
all rights under the testament. He was
going to have her write some other things,
but the court thought the Irony had gone
far enough.
Denies &he Is a Forg^er.
Replying to Pence's questions, Mrs. Pur
cejl said 6he had not written the trust
will which mysteriously disappeared from
the County Clerk's office; that she had
not stolen it; did not know how much re
ward the executors had.offered for its re
turn, or how hard the Executors had tried
to recover It. She made a couple of in:
material corrections to her testimony of
the day before and was temporarily ex
cused. .
H. M. Bryant was then ushered into the
case. He calls San Francisco his home,
although he resides in Oakland. In tho
last three or four years he has occupied
apartments in no lei's than a hundrfA
hotels and rooming houses, but he could
enly remember the names and locations of
three cr four of them. He was certain
of three dates â ISSB. when he olalms he
â¢was Introduced to Fair in San Franc'sco;
IS9I. when he asserts he first come to CHli
fornia, and the latter part of May, 1592,
when he says he met Mrs. Craven-Fair
and the Senator in the latter's office. His
mind is a blank on all other days and
dates.
Told Bryant She Was His Wife.
According to his testimony he was in
Fair's office during th*Â» latter part of May
or the first of June, 1592, when Mrs. Cra
ven-Fair came In.
"Fair introduced her; to me as his wife,"
continued the witness. "She began talk
ing to him about going away, and as tho
matter was no business of mine I did not
listen to the details of the conversation
After she left the office Fair requpsted
me not to mention about him being mar
ried, as he did not want the public to
know. He referred to his wife as 'Net
tie.'" '.
Bryant testified that he saw the couple
a few days later In a doorway on Sutler
or Post street talking with a third party.
This bit of evidence is supposed to dove
tail with the story of the meeting of Mrs.
Craven-Fair, the Senator and Notary
Craig. . â¢ Â¦
"Touched" the Senator for $50.
He remembered the date of the meetlnj?
at Fair's office from the fact that he went
there that day to make a "touch" '-'or $00
and got it. He needed the money to send
a young woman named June Payne back
tp her home in Salt Lake City. He bought
her a first-class ticket at the Seventh
street depot, Oakland, but he. did not re
member that. her name was on the cou
pon.
A search will be made through the.rail
road's records to ascertain how near Bry
ant Is to being correct. Hia crosa-cxaru
ination will be continued to-day.

THE STARVATION PUN
Of Treating Dyspepsia and ' Stomach
Troubles Is Useless and Un-
scientific
ThÂ© almost certain failur* of the star-
vation cure for dyspepsia has been proven
time and again, but even now a course of
Cietlr.e is generally the first thing recom-
mended for a case of Indigestion or any
etomach trouble.
Many people with weak digestion, as
well as some physicians, consider the first
etep to take ln attempting to cure indiges-
tion is to restrict the diet, either by se-
lecting certain foods and rejecting others
or to cut down the amount of food eaten
to barely enouÃh to keep soul and body
together, in other words, the starvation
plan is by many supposed to be the first
essential.
All this is radically wrong. It Is foolish
and unscientific to recommend dieting to
a man already suffering from starvation
because Indigestion Itself starves every
organ, nerve and fiber ln the body.
What people with poor digestion most
need Is abundant nutrition, plenty of good.
wholesome, properly cooked food, and
Fomethlng to assist the weak stomach to
digest it.
This is exactly the purpose for which
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted
and the true reason why they cure the
worst cases of stomach trouble.
Eat a sufficient amount of wholesome
*ood and after each meal take one or two
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to promptly
digest It.
In this way the system Is nourished and
the overworked stomach rested, because
the tablets will digest the food whether
the stomach works or not. one grain of
the active digestive principle ln Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets being sufficient to
digest 3000 grains of meat, eggs or other
albuminous food.
Dr. Harlandson and Dr. Redwell recom-
mend these tablets ln all cases of defect-
ive digestion because the pepsin and dias-
taste in them are absolutely free from
ar.imaJ matter and otf.er impurities and
being pleasant to the taste are as safe
and harmless for the child as for the
adult.
All drugstores sell this excellent prepa-
ration and the daily use of them after
mea'.s will be of great beneflt. not only a*
en Immediate relief but to permanently
build up and invigorate the digestive or-
gans.

SOME PERTINENT STATISTICS
STATISTICS showing the number of employes
killed or injured in the service of railroad cor
â¢porations, published" in the annual report of the
Railroad Commissioners, are pertinent to a consid
eration of the so-called "relief" scheme of the South
ern Pacific Company and are a timely contribution
to the discussion of the subject.
The report shows that during the year 1809 there
were 51 employes killed and 529 injured. The' deaths
and injuries are attributed to ''coupling, falling from
trains, overhead obstructions and derailments."
During the previous year the number of such acci
dents was smaller, the report for that year showing
32 employes killed and 373 injured.
.The statistics of the Commissioners are of course
taken from the reports of the railroads and are not
subject to . suspicion of exaggeration. .Most of the
killed and the injured were of course employesof the
Southern Pacific system, for that system controls the
bulk of the railroads in the State. It will be seen,
therefore, that the number of emplbycs killed or in
jured for which the Southern Pacific is responsible is
notably large, and that the company will be doing 1
thrifty work for itself, if it. can get its employes into
the relief scheme- by which they will be made to in
sure the lives and limbs of one another, and thus rid
the corporation of the damages which it is now re
quired to pay under the law. â¢
Since the intelligence of the employes of the road
detected the trick in the scheme, and their opposition
to it was made manifest, the corporation has devised a
modified plan, which eliminates some of the evils of
the scheme as at first proposed, but it remains es
sentially bad. Huntington's thriftiness was never put
to a much meaner purpose than that of shifting from
a rich corporation upon its employes the burden of
damages for accidents for which the corporation is
itself responsible, and the reports of the Railroad
Commissioners make plain what is evidently one of
the. chief reasons why the scheme was concocted.
*It appears 'that about everything man knows how
to do will be used in the wars of the future, for it is
now 6aid that in addition to bicycle, automobile and
balloon corps, the French are experimenting to see
what advantage could be gained by having a corps of
skilled stilt-walkers. It is believed they can be ef
fective in placing telegraph wires and in fording
streams j:oo deep for men on foot.
There is therefore a fair prospect that we are to have
an end of delays at last.' Still the. Mayor may object
to this as he^has done to the former ordinance on the
subject. If 'that prove to be the case demand
upon him to frame an ordinance of his own will be
imperative. This is one of the instances in which the
public desire for right action cannot be much longer
withstood. â¢

VEXATIOUS DELAYS
ONCE more the Telephone Company has gained
something of a victory over the people.
Another delay has stopped the movement
toward compelling it to * pay a just portion of tax
ation and give a better service to the public. The
Mayor's veto of the ordinance of the late Board of
Supervisors requiring the corporation to make the
switch desired by a patron of the " telephone slot
machines before demanding the deposit of the nickel
in the machine has been sustained, and the .whole is
sue has to be taken up again.
The Mayor's skill in detecting defects in every or
dinance by which it is proposed to tax the telephones
or to protect the'public against its unfair methods of
doing business serves the corporation excellently
well. By his vetoes delay follows" delay, and nothing
is accomplished. These tactics are becoming as vex
atious and intolerable as those by which the Wells-
Fargo Express Company manages, despite the de
cisions of courts against it, to shirk its taxes and'im-^
pose upon its patrons.
Since the Mayor is never satisfied with any tele
phone ordinance devised by the Supervisors, it should
require him to draw up one of his own. It is time
that his position on the issue be defined. If he pur
poses to veto every ordinance that is passed by the
board, while pretending to be in favor of a better or
dinance, it' is dear the corporation will succeed in
escaping taxation indefinitely. .
Supervisor McCarthy has introduced an ordinance
fixing a tax upon telephone slot machines, and it "is
understood it will be taken up. as soon as the ques
tion concerning the official paper is settled. The new
ordinance is based upon one which has proven suc
cessful elsewhere and stood the test of the courts.

SACRAMENTO CONGRATULATED.
UPON the victory which has been achieved in the
contest against the gambling fraternity in that
city the people, of Sacramento and their offi
cials are to be congratulated. Mayor . Clark, sup
ported by a resolute public sentiment and ably sec
onded by Chief of Police Sullivan, has apparently
cleared the community of open gambling ' and re
lieved it from a form of temptation that leads to fraud
and crime, and not infrequently to suicide.
When the Mayor began the contest against the gam
blers they were defiant and aggressive, and for a time
they were able to make to any reform legislation an
opposition that seemed strong enough to justify their
boasts of ultimate success. The ordinances, how
ever, were enacted, and then came the appeal to the
courts. The result there has upheld the reformers.
One of the principal owners of a gambling-room in
the city was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine
of $100. That, it seems, has been sufficient to put an
er.d to the struggle. Recent reports from the city are
to the effect that the Chief of Police has reiterated a
determination to enforce the law strictly, firmly and
impartially, and as a consequence the gamblers are
moving out of town and seeking quarters elsewhere.
It is to be noted that the victory for good morals
in Sacramento may entail an increase of gamblers in
other communities, but they have no right to com
plain â the remedy is in their own hands. They have
only to follow the example of Sacramento and the
gamblers will have to leave the State altogether.
Mayor Clark has proven himself the right man in the
right place and at the right time.
HAVOC AND WAR DOGS
I~*HE Examiner is at the expense of sending a
man all the way to British Columbia to inspect
and photograph the yard, docks and fortifica
tions at Esquimalt, and because he was denied admis
sion and refused the right to roam at will among the
j;uns that paper is positive that England is laying in
srr.okeiess powder, guns and things to attack the
United States, and demands that we line with fortifi
cations both sides the Nicaragua canaf in order to
repel the attack! As it is a matter of 4000 miles from
the Straits of San Juan de Fuca to the Pacific end of
the canal, an artillery duel between the two points
would cause but little carnage, unless the Examiner
proposes to shoot by telegraph or the long distance
telephone. That paper's idea of fortifying seems to
be that it is like lawn gardening, for ornament, or a
5 o'clock tea, for refreshment or sociability. If its
man had been invited into the Esquimalt works,
treated to a cold bottle and told to run his head in
the muzzle of a big gun and bring home a tompion
for a keepsake, it would have concluded that all is
well between this country and England, and the guns
are there to use in firing salutes while the band plays
'"God Save the Queen."
England has a citadel at Quebec, one at Gibraltar,
and is making one at Esquimalt. These are the ne
cessities of empire. France had a few citadels also,
which became necessary after Louis XIV ravaged
the Palatinate and nailed the flag of the Bourbons to
territory that carried with it a hostile and indignant
population. But in 1870 the Prussians paid as much
attention to those works as they would to so many
cr.b houses, and the French garrison were pained to
pee the stolid Germans march right past into France
Â«Â«nd proceed to help themselves to the stuffing of her,
regardless of frontier forts and great guns.
The reasoning by which the Examiner reaches its
conclusion that perfidious Albion intends to bombard
Portland and San Francisco from Esquimalt begins
with refusing it admission to see the guns and works!
Now if the Examiner will send its expert on guns
and Gibraltars up to the Presidio, where our Govern
ment is placing hidden batteries, disappearing guns.
Zalinski's dynamite rifles and azimuth scales for aim
ing them all. he will be as sternly denied admission
and the rijrht to use his kodak as he was at Esqui
malt. Reasoning on the same line and from the
same premise, the Examiner will be forced to the
concluÂ«ion that it is a naval power of which both
England and America are afraid, and against which
they are building citadels, and buying powder, for
do they not both deny to it the rights of a free com
moner, an amateur photographer and an inventor of
facts?
We have a suggestion to make to the Examiner, in
view of this situation. Let it eliminate England from
the world's politics by refusing to let her name appear
in its news columns, as it does the name of Congress
man de Vries. By the simple use of its disappearing
blue pencil it can make all the works of Esquimalt as
harmless as mud pie. This is its plan of. campaign
with De Vries, and it already gloats over his remains.
If it can wipe him off the slate, it can also in the
same way dispose of its two rivals in the regulation of
ihe world, Great Britain and the United States.
A report from New York announces that Davi<i
Bennett Hill has begun to show signs of political ac
tivity again, but his movement thus far has hardly
amounted to more than a spasmodic wiggle, for the

MAIL STEAMERS
AND TRANSPORTS
IN QUARANTINE
Gaelic Prom the Orient Has
a Suspected Case of
Plague Aboard.
Charles NÂ«lson, From Makaweli, and
Duke of Fife, From Manila, Held
for Inspection â No Chances
Being Taken.
Three steamers were sent into quaran
tine by Dr. Kinyoun yesterday. One of
them was the Occidental and Oriental
Company's steamer Gaelic from the Ori
ent; another was the transport Duke of
Fife from Manila, and the third was the
Bteamer Charles Nelson from Makawell,
11. I. They will be held two or three
days for fumigation and will then be re
leased.
The Gaelic brought up 40 cabin, S second
class, 190 Japanese and I*7 Chinese paa
sengers. Those who are in the cabin are:
H. Arita, Thomas Chapman, Captain J.
McGowan, W. H. Hamilton, Horace In
man, G. Kawata, Mrs. C. Myburgh, Miss
E. J. Newton, General T. Ota, Rev. E. L.
Stevens, W. J. Treat, Colonel Charles H.
Bird, F. Cornehl, Hon. Al Grant. J. Har
wood, H. lkeda, A. Kose, F. J. Mayers.-
E. W. Ogden, Mr. and Mrs. S. A. Perlne
and child, Mrs. M. Stephenson, Mrs. M.
S. Vail and three children, GraiÃln Cook,
William Friedlander, H. S. Goodfellow,
Charles Homey, R. jurnltschek. Mrs. F.
E. Meigs and two children, it. Mayor,
Mrs. A. Ogden,. Rev.. T. Richard, R. Shar
pies, R. H.- Fisher. â¢
Soon after Dr. Kinyoun boarded the
Gaelic he found there was a case of 111.
ness aboard. One of the Chinese was very
sick, some of the symptoms - resembling
those of bubonic plague. Some blood was
taken from the Mongolian's veins and this
will be injected into a guinea pig. Should
no evil results: follow the operation the
steamer will be released to-morrow.
Among those in the cabin on the Gaelic
is Colonel' Charles H. Bird, the Inspector
of the transport service. He has been
for several months in Manila and is now
homeward bound via San Francisco. Gen
eral Ota of the Japanese army also came
over on the steamer. He will make a tour
of the United States before going back to
Japan.
Further news of the accident on the
occasion of the German Emperor's birth
day on the United States gunboat Wheel
ing at Hongkong came by the Gaelic. A
gun misfired, and while it was being ex
amined the ammunition exploded and
burst open the break block. Gunner's
Mate Campbell and Wilson were killed
and Lieutenant Commander F. E. Beatty
and Gunners Conroy and Bite seriously
injured. One thousand dollars was con
tributed by British for the relatives of
deceased. .
The Gaelic reports that the battleship
Oregon arrived at Yokohama on Febru
ary 21. The crew is to be given a char.oe
to recuperate, as they have been In.con
stant service in the Philippines for a long
time. Her marines assisted in the defense
of Cavite and her sailors were almost con
stantly engaged on boat details on the
river.
The Gaelic brought up nearly 4000 tons
of cargo. It is composed mainly of rice,
tea, raw silk and matting.
The quarantining of the Charles Nelscn
was a disappointment to her owners' and
agents. She has a large cargo of sugar
which is badly wanted at the refinery.
There has be^n no signs of the plague at
Makawell, but Dr. Kinyoun would not
take any chances, so the steamer had to
go into quarantine. The Nelson brings*
up thirteen cabin passengers. She would
have been here Monday had she not lost n.
blade of her propeller on March 8. It will
probably be Friday before she is" released
from quarantine.
The Duke. of Fife was thirty-five days
from Manila and twenty-three from Naga
saki. She brought two cabin passengers
and the remains of thirty-three soldier*.
She had a clean bill of health from Japan,
but still she has to be fumigated, as the
plague is raging in Japan.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAKGH 14, lyuo.
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S CHANGE.
A FEW months ago President Wheeler of the
University was in harmony With the imperial
ists. Like many others, he is now brought face
to face with the practical questions of government
and policy, which come to the front along with what
was then hypocritically called our providential des
tiny. Large words and allusions to the flag no longer
answer. Reference to the brave sacrifice of our
troops, as endured "in defense of their country," no
longer suffice to describe an errand of invasion and
conquest. The mud and mire into which a foreign
policy fathered by Morgan, Money and other Dem
ocrats and left as a foundling on the Republican door
step has led the country are now impeding us.
The early and timely warnings uttered by Senators
Hoar, Wellington, Hale and Mason are being daily
justified, and men like President Wheeler are im
pressed by the situation and no longer speak in the
color of thoughtless enthusiasm.
In his address to the Monticello Club on Saturday
last he took new ground and higher than before.
It is now seen plainly that we must inflict harm
npon. constitutional government at home, no matter
which way we turn in providing government for our
tropical possessions abroad. If we admit them to
Territorial status they become possible States and
their fifteen or eighteen millions of people become
citizens of the United States. A resident of New
Mexico. Arizona or Oklahoma, passing therefrom to
any State and fulfilling the residence qualification of
its laws, is a citizen,, with a vote and the full stature
of citizenship. How and where can we draw the line
if we have a Porto Rican, Hawaiian and Philippine
Territory?
It is a recognized constitutional principle that Con
gress in governing Territories exercises both Federal
and State power, but in each case its authority is lim
ited by the constitution. That constitution grants
powers to the Federal Government and prohibits
powers to the States. When Congress, therefore, en
ters a Territory it cannot exceed the grant to the
Federal Government nor the prohibition that is upon
the States. In enforcing State authority in a Terri
tory, therefore, Congress cannot deprive any one of
life, liberty or property without due process of law.
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws.
The Supreme Court of the United States in the
Utah case decided that: "The personal and civil
rights of the inhabitants of the Territories are se
cured to them, as to other citizens, by the principles
of constitutional liberty, which restrain all the agen
cies of government, State and national." The four
teenth amendment to the constitution provides that
all persons born or naturalized in the United States,
and subject to the jurisdiction therepf, are citizens of
the United States.
It is plain that if we accept, the Territorial horn of
the dilemma we are taking in several millions of
tropical citizens of the United States. Can Congress
deny to them free transit and choice of residence any
where in the United States or the elector's right in
any State where they fulfill its law of residence? We
are convinced that to this status the people of this
republic will never consent. They will not- trade their
birthright for the pottage of tropical commerce.
But what follows? Nothing but that straight im
perialism, finely described by President Wheeler as
"a government from without, proceeding according to
lines that take no account of the choice or interests of
those governed."
Of course we may say that while we deny to these
new subjects choice in the manner of their govern
ment we intend to consult their interests, but all stu
dents of history and of civil institutions know that is
meaningless. No government imposed without con
sent of the governed ever considered any interest but
its own.
President Wheeler concludes that: "Spain wrecked
itself by reason of its lust for empire, which domi
nated its entire career and lowered the plane of all
who were subject to it. In that idea of colonial gov
ernment is the lesson of our danger. If any terri
tory shall be attached to this nation according to an
arbitrary bond forced out of the natural course of its
history', that will be imperialism. Its worst form is
that which imposes subjection arbitrarily."
If any one fail to see the rapidly gathering danger
he is blind. Every attempt to legislate discloses it.
Every bill for a law to touch these external posses
sions so far proposed in Congress injures them or us
in a vital spot. What further proof do men need of
the .irreconcilable nature of the issue? Our labor
lawÂ« extended to the Territory of Hawaii destroy its
industries. Free trade bestowed upon Porto Rico.
Hawaii and the Philippines destroys our industries.
It is for this reason that The Call has advised that no
legislation be now attempted, but that the subject be
left to the sober second thought of the people, which
we have no doubt will decide that we want no tropi
cal people, either as republican citizens or imperial
subjects.

fully and with increased fervor observed
this day as one holy, full of beautiful
recollections and abundant of exemplars
of high national endeavor and lofty pa
triotism in the cause of Irish freedomâ
(Applause)â as a day upon which, through
the influence of native songs and soliJ elo
quence, we love to hold converse with the
spirit of our illustrous dead and teaching
through this communion new hope and
courage for the future.
Day We Love to Honor.
"For thirty years the Knights of the
Red Branch have existed in this city as an
arm of a body forty thousand strong
throughout the nation. It Is an organiza
tion non-sectarian In character. It is not
a beneficiary society. Through It no selfish
Interests can be served. It stands alone
for the recognition of Irish nationality.
(Applause.) It stands for rebellion against
all alien rule in Ireland; It stands for the
right of Irish men, and Irish men alone,
to govern the land of their nativity."
(Applause.) ... ,
At the conclusion of his remarks a very
creditable programme of song, in which
M. Merigan. W. H. Ogilvle." Miss Kathe
rlne Black. Robert Lloyd and Miss Daisy
V. Keane took part, was rendered. .
Father Yorke was then Introduced and
a storm of applause greeted him. Time
after time he sought to speak but the
cheers of hundreds upon hundreds of peo
ple drowned his voice. At last silence was
restored and he began his address. He
spoke in part as follows:
Emmet's Grand Patriotism.
"As the chairman so eloquently said,
year after year the Knights of the Red
branch and their friends In the city of
San Francisco meet together to commem
orate tho name of a man who died a
felon's death, whose grave is marked by
no epitaph, whose years seemed cut short
too soon. A young man barely 24 years of
age who had just come into a fortune,
â¢who was betrothed to one who inspired
poets to some of their sweetest music,
suddenly gives it all up In exchange for
what the wise men of that day and the
wise men of this day. for the generations
do not change much would call empti
ness and folly. Yet it is a very strange
thing that of all those who then pitied
him, that of those who sat in Judgment
upon him, there is not an enemy re
maining; there is not one celebrated or
this day celebrated, unless it is old Nor
berry."
The mention of his name brought forth
hisses and above this sound of disappro
bation Father. Torke's voice was heard
saying that Norberry was celebrated in
just the same way as Pontius Pilate is
celebrated in the Apostles' Creed. Con
tinuing he said: Â¦
"Even his very friends despaired of him,
for Emmet had friends. You heard that
sad and beautiful song sung this evening
â'Breathe not his name; let It sleep
In the shade where cold and unknown
his relics are laid.' This was the best
that could be said of him by his best
friends and yet, ladies and gentlemen, we
have this melancholy motto, yet we do
not seem to be afraid to breathe his
name, and we don't find that 1 name sleep-
Ing In the shade; rather the name of
Robert Emmet has become to generations
as bright as when the Creator said in the
beginning, 'Let there be light,' and there
was light. (Applause). It has risen from
shade and gone out to the world to be
to the Irish people not only at home but
abroad as the pillar of fire that led an
other people out of a ' house of bondage
into the promised land and our people
from the long centuries of oppression to
the enjoyment of their own freedom. The
reason, ladies and gentlemen, why Robert
Emmet has not become a mere intrusion
in' some of Moore's poems has been that
it stood for a principle. Nothing in the
world seems so weak as principle, yet
there is nothing really so strong. Prin
ciple to-day Is the spirit of the men of
policy. It is not the spirit of the men
who believe in selling to-morrow for the
benefit of to-day, but a principle is. that
which wins in the 'long run.* (Applause).
Stability of Principle.
"There are men who have no time to
wait. Where are the men of policy of
yesterday and the day before? Sometimes
as you pass along your Btreets you will
notice on a deserted barn or broken-down
fence a weather-atalned banner inviting
you to vote for somebody who was great
in his day. (Laughter.) To-day nothing
remains of It but something that is food
for the mockery of the small boy and
food lor the goats. (Laughter.) Some of
them have periehed by policy, others have
been ruined by success. (Applause.)
"Principle, ladies and gentlemen, is the
vindication of truth and manhood. There
has not been created on this earth any
thing more honorable than ,a man. God
haa made him the head of. his creation,
and when his Son came to be united with
this creation of his, he came not in the
guise of an angel, but he came - in the
guise of humanity. The dignity of a man
does not consist of fine raiment, wealth,
station in life; it consists in the dignity
of the soul; it consists In this that we are
able to call it our own. (Applause^) â¢
"Now each soul is different. God dtd
not create them all alike. We are indi
viduals. Perhaps the very first lesson
that a parent learns when a family be
gins to grow up is that one child is bo
unlike another; that it has its distinct
character and trained in its own way
there Is the â¢ chance thatjt will succeed
where another child might fail. So- you

piece and doubtless stamps Aeschylus as
one of the half dozen greatest poets of
the world.
The "Oedipus Tyrannus" of Sophocles
powerfully sets forth the successive steps
by which the prosperous King Oedipus
discovers that he has unwittingly mur
dered hl3 own father and become the
parent of children by his own mother.
; The inevitable way in which "the action
moves straight and undistracted toward
I the catastrophe" doubtless justifies Aris
totle In treating the "Oedipus Tyrannus"
as the type of the highest Greek tragedy.
Antigone, the daughter of this same
Oedipus. Is in Sophocles' hands the most
interesting woman of Greek, literature,
and hence this is the most celebrated
Greek drama. She defies the law of the
land in burying the corpse of her brother
Polynices and suffers martyrdom in con
sequence. It Is impossible to conceive of
loftier language than her defiance of
Creon:
Nor did I deem thy edicts ttronÃ enough.
That thou. a mortal man, ahouldat OTerpaw
The unwritten laws of God that know not
change.
They are not of to-day nor yesterday.
But live forever.
Of the three great tragic poets Aeschy
lus is the greatest poetic genius. The
legend that the god Dionysus directed
the boy In a vision to devote himself to
tragedy might well have been true. A
very demiurge he Isâ elemental, god-in
toxicated, of sublime Imaginative power
creator of the most splendid lyrics. The
masterful self-sufficiency of his Clytem
nestra, the plastic beauty of his Iphi
genia, the sublime unyieldingness of his
Prometheusâ these things and many more
place him among ancient poets perhaoa
second only to Homer. â¢-Â»â¢Â»'
Sophocles had perhaps the happiest lot
among the ancientsâ health. beauty,
wealth, victory with his first tragedy and
the primacy in letters for all his sixty
years thereafter, such repute for gentle
ness as to make him the idol of the peo
ple and for good Judgment as to induce
the populace to elect him general and
counselor. And so he was the fit expo
nentâartistic and spiritualâ of the age of
Aery different from both was Euripidesâ
the lonely thinker, philosophical radical
Innovator In poetry and music, "prophet
of a cosmopolitan humanity." kinsman of
the troubled spirits of all ages, forerunner
of romantic drama, most appreciative of
feminine worth, realist, and so bringing
his characters down into the everyday at
mosphere, hence charged with replacing
the heroic by the sensational. He is seen
at his best in such plays as "The Bac
chae," "Alcestis" and "Iphigenia in Tau
ris.' Both Aeschylus and Euripides are
nearer to us than Sophocles. The Hebrew
scriptures have -prepared us for Aeschylus,
whom we recognize as akin to Job and
Isaiah: through hia more modern spirit
we can apprehend Euripides most readily
of all. Sophocles is an Athenian of Athe
nians, and fully to appreciate him we
must become in a sense Atticized.

. There were many comedians before Aris

primarily Aristophanes. He belongs to
the second half of the fifth century, was a
contemporary and cordial hater of Euripi

eleven are extant. He represents what la
called old comedy, i. c.. personal and po
litical satire, and was the. great burlesque
critic of Athens. Demagogues like Cleon,
philosophers like Socrates, poets like Eu
ripides were ridiculed and maligned. When
liberty of personal satire was somewhat
curtailed by law, or taste was changing.
Aristophanes tended toward what was
afterward called new comedy, or the com
edy of manners. But the great exporent
In this field was Menander. of whom not
a complete play is extant, though we hay*
adaptations of his comedies In the Latin
of Plautus and Terence. Aristophanes was
and remains doubtless the greatest comic
poet of the world, but the Romans learned
comedy chiefly from Menander. and the
moderns again have learned it especially

comedy of the lost Menander has been not
less far reaching in its influence than that
of Aristophanes.

and taking its subjects from mythology,
held its place â¢ after tragedy and . comedy
had borrowed most r>f its functions, prob
ably through a sort of religious conserva
tism.
Dramatic representations were not given
at Athens at any and all times, as now
adays, but at the festivals of the god of
wine. Tragedy was admitted to the pub
lic festivals at Athens in 536 B. C, com
edy some seventy years later. The chief
glory of the greater Dlonyala. in the
month Elaphebolion (March-April), was
the new tragedies exhibited. Then Athens
made holiday before her allies, whose
tribute was then brought by representa
tives to Athens, before delegates from all
other Greek cities and before the whole
assembly of her own citizens. At the Le
naea, in Gamelion (January-Februaiy),
which was more of a home festival, com
edy had chief place. At the country
Dionysia, in December, usually only plaj'3
were given which had been already ex
hibited in the city. The great Dion>sia,
like a modern musical festival, lasted only
a few days (three or four), and on each
day regularly three tragedies, one com
edy and one satyr were exhibited, which,
with the dithyramb and other musical
features, made a very full day.
If a poet wished to exhibit at the greater
Dionysia he applied to the chief archon,
if at the Lenaea to the second archon. for
a chorus. If his request was granted
there was assigned him a choregus, who
chose from the singers of hi 3 tribe a
chorus, had these trained by the poet or
Chorus leader and provided for their main
tenance and costumes. This liturgy, as it
was called, was at once a burden and an
honor, ana was often performed v'Jth
gTeat magnificence and expense. The
chorus, consisting In tragedy of twelve
(later fifteen) persons. In comedy of twen
ty-four, executed dance movements
(strophe and antistrophe) as they sans,
and indispensable accompanists were the
flute player and the lyrist. The three act
orsâoriginally one. Increased by Aeschy
lus to two, by Sophocles to three â dis
tributed all the roles among them, the
parts of women being taken by men. The
actors were allotted to the parts and paid
by the state. In the costumes of tha
tragic actors especially characteristic were
the long, flowing particolored robes, the
high-soled buskin or boot and the impos
ing headdress and mask, the whole being
intended to lend dignity and increase the
stature. For comedy characteristic was
the soccus or low shoe, but the dresa was
more like that of everyday life, rhert
was not much opportunity for action on
the Greek stage, and none for play of fea
ture so that the prime requisite for nn
actor was a fine musical voice. The audi
ence at Athens, numbering 20.000 to 30.000
and sitting in the open air, had sensitive
ears, so that the actor must have a dis
tinct, musical voice, which could carry
far The people, whose feeling for rnyinm
was probably as nice as that of modern
musical audiences for time, would storm
if the meter was spoiled, a quantity
missed, a syllable dropped or an accent
m The a antique Greek theater consisted in
the main of two parts, the auditorium or
theater proper, and the oval or round
orchestra for the evolutions of the;
chorus. As dramatic spectacles were !
given in the open air the Greeks
generally availed themselves of the
fide of a hill so shaped as to con
stitute a sort of natural amphitheater.
At Athens the Theater of Dionysus occu
pied the southeast slope of the Acropolis,
where the spectators sat with their backs
to the Acropolis and their faces toward
Mount Hymettus and the Bea. Aisles ra
diating from the center enabled the soec
tators to reach the rows of (marble)
benches. The part reserved for the move
ments of the actors, whether higher than
or on a level with the orchestra, was
email, since the actors were few. The
back of the stage represented in tragedy
a temple or palace: in comedy a private
house or a street. The scenery was sim
ple, consisting of; hangings, or painted
woodwork. and- triangular revolving
prisms at either Bide, properly-decorated.
'Facilitated change of scene. The curtain
was pulled up. not let down. The sub
jects of tragedy were taken from mytnol
ojrv or mythical history, and the persons
were the gods or demigods and heroes of
the race, the main outlines of the story
being always known to the audience.
Tragedy was really a religious celebra
tion" Comedy, on the other hand, repre
sented not the solemn but the frolicsome
spirit of the season, and the subjects and
characters were taken from daily life, as
was the language used. ...
In marked contrast with Athenian late
ness of development in general was the
sudden growth of the" drama. li^the
early part of the fifth century coincided
an era of great natural activity and a

begrln to realize that soul differs from soul
as star differs from etar.
"When we begin to discuss educationâ
what Is a good and what is a bad educa
tion; what is training a man for his
world's work; we come to the conclusion
that we will not make all men alike; that
we will not cast them in the same mold,
but will bring out the good that is in the
character and turn it to its highest pos
sibilities.
"Now, ladles and gentlemen. Just as
each individual Jias its character â differ
ent from the character of every other in
dividual, and just as true education con
sists of developing that character accord
ing to its own necessitiesâ so groups of
men have their characters to be so de
veloped.
"Imperialism. I take It, means that sys
tem of government which extends over a
large area and which tries to make of the
people who live in that area common sub
jects of a common government. Nation
ality, I take it, means that state of things
by which groups of Individuals will be
permitted to retain their ancient charac
teristics, to carry out their own ways and
work out their own salvation according to
the laws by which they have been accus
tomed to move. I believe that that con
uition of humanity is the best where the
largest liberty is allowed to the nation.
Of course^ there are objections to this
state of affairs just as there are objections
to political liberty.
"You cannot break down this spirit of
nationality. You may put the whole na
tion into barracks, you may do your best
to mold it into some people, but the soul
that is in nations is immortal. It cannot
be killed; it will survive, it will assert it
pelf, and nations will live when imperial
ism is In the grave, a rotten corpse."
(Applause.)
"Isow, these are mere first principles of
free government. In the beginning and
even now one man has no power over the
other. We are all free and equal. We
remain so to the end. Why should John
Smith have more power over Thomas
Robinson? You cannot find any reason
ror it. The only power given is in such
measure as is necessary for carrying on
the affairs of the state. The les3 power
we have and the less government we have
so much the better for the country. I
suppose you all know that some 300 years
ago kings had a right from God to rule
the earthâ the divine right of God to gov
ern-and it is this theory that the Kaiser
has not altogether forgotten.
No Right to Shoot Down the Boers.
It was called and Is now called the
wm? 6 rlght of Kln es. but that has been
obliterated; it has been cast away in the
old lumber rooms and in its place is the
worse heresy of the divine right of races.
The divine right of races has not given
one race the power to laud it over another.
Last of all, it has not been given to that
mongrel, which we call the Anglo-Saxon,
the right to do so. It has given them no
right to shoot down the Boers in South
Africa. (Applause.) And we have no
right to murder the Filipinos. (Applause.)
That is the reason why we sympathize
and the vast majority of the people sym
pathize with that wonderous and glorious
band in South Africa, which makes this
nineteenth century feel that the days of
chivalry have not passed; that these peo
ple in the desert, fighting with their
backs to their walls, are fighting against
the biggest brutalist and bloodiest bully
that ever walked. (Tremendous applause.)
"The Anglo-Saxons have a number of
arguments to prove their right to their
conduct in South Africa. They claim that
the Boers are impervious to Anglo-Saxon
good government; that they are hostile
to religious liberty. The blessed British
Government which looks upon the Jesuits
in Ireland as felons, shuts Catholics out
of the hio-hest positions In its gift, is high
ly scandalized because the Boers do not
permit religious liberty; that they will not
permit the Catholics to vote. I do not
enter upon this question from the stand
point of facts. I do not know how things
stand in South Africa, but it may be that
the Boers did take lessons from the Brit
ish and did cast off the Catholics.
"Catholics are a far-seeing people and
they know that liberty will correct its own
mistakes, and they believe with John Car
roll and the other leaders of the Catho
lics here that there is a far better chance
of their getting their rights by throwing
In their lot with their fellow-citizens and
trust to a free government, a government
of the. people, by the people and for the
people, than to trust the Government of
England beyond the seas. And I say here
now that it is far better for the Catholics
of the Transvaal to stand by their fellow
citizens, even though they are not allowed
a franchise, because their blood will plead
eloquently, and in the end freedom will
correct one excess, and it Is better to be
Outlanders In the Transvaal under a free
government than helots under England's
heel." (Applause.)
Father Yorke Honored.
Rev, Father Peter C. Yorke hag re
ceived an invitation from Archbishop
Christie of Oregon to preach the St. Pat
rick's Day oration in the cathedral at
Portland. This unusual and unexpected
honor which has been conferred upon the
brilliant clergyman will give gratification
to his friends. Father Yorke has accept
ed the invitation and will leave at once
for Portland.
THE Knights of the Red Branch of
this city have held many celebra
tions In honor of the birth of Robert
Emmet, but never before in their
history perhaps have they held one
which possessed such marked significance
as that which was given last night In Met
ropolitan Hall. These celebrations have
been made a plea for Irish nationality, but
last,, night the plea was more eloquent,
more stirring, more logical than ever be
fore and with It was involved an able dis
cussion of eventÃ that are holding the at
tention of the world. The orator of the
evening was the Rev. Father Peter C.
Yorke and he spoke to an audience that
crowded the hail from the stage to the
ceiling, filling every seat, crowding the
aisles, thronging the corridors and tres
passing even upon the stairs. In the au
dience were men prominent in the affairs
of the cityâ lawyers. Judges, merchants
and mechanics. And as the orator pro
gressed, now sparkling with wit and
sallies of humor, now pleading in pathos
for the causes he espoused, the great
throng interrupted time after time in ap
plause. The address was brilliant.
In opening, Father Yorke paid a splen
did tribute to Robert Emmet, and from
the patriotic lessons of the Irish hero's
life drew a warning against what he be
lieves to be the menace of the policy of
the United States and of England toward
the Filipinos and the Boers. The fearful
heresy of the divine right of kings, he
believes, has given place to the immeasur
ably worse heresy of the divine right of
races, and England and America are act
ing the roles of bloody oppressors by In
vading the lands and homes of people
who have a God-given right of national
ity. Under the pretense of planting in
these lands the Hag of freedom England
and America, he said, are making Cnrts
tfans at the point or the sword and driv
ing into blood-stained fields the flag or
trade. ' . ,
Our Hands Are Stained.
England has no more right, the speaker
said, to kill the Boers than we have to
murder the Filipinos, and the reason that
we cannot answer the cry of agony. that
comes from South Africa is the reason
that Cain gave for his refusal to. answer
for his brotherâ our own hands are
stained with blood. While the address of
the reverend gentleman was brilliant in
its arts of the orator, it was logical to the
severest degree In its exposition of the
principles that establish the right of peo
ples to their own national life. As the in
dividual possesses the inalienable right to
individuality, so the nation has the right
of nationality. Not imperialism but na
tionality is the purpose of human govern
ment.
The worst government a people can give
itself, he said, Is infinitely better than the
best government a foreign power can give
it, and nations will live and thrive when
imperialism is in the grave, a rotting
corpse. To the Boers the speaker paid
the highest tribute. They are offering, he
declared, the grandest spectacle of the
nineteenth century. They are pledging
everything on earth to win the right to
live out their national life to its destiny.
They are proving to the world that the
age of chivalry and manhood has not
passed and the world Is looking idly on
while the biggest, brutalest, bloodiest bul
ly that stalks the earth is crushing tbe
very life out of a little people.
Irish Sympathy for the Boers.
And there is between the Irish and the
Boers, he said, a bond of natural sym
pathy. The Irish have struggled for cen
turies to retain their nationality, to which
by the position of their island, their
blood, civilization and ability to govern
themselves they have a right. They have
liberty in their blood, yet if they would
be free they must fight for their freedom.
If a nation wants to be independent, the
speaker said, it must fight for its indepen
dence. If Ireland wants to be free she
can secure her freedom by force of arms.
England, he said. Is shouting that the
Boers violated treaties, hut England never
kept a treaty that she could break and if
the wise men of America believe that she
will honor one now in connection with the
Nicaraguan canal they will learn their
terrible mistake. They will find that the
only treaty seal which England will re
spect is that' which America will press
upon her by cannon of the latest make.
And to those that urge the civilization of
the Anglo-Saxon as the vindication of
English policy the reverend gentleman
had a word to say. He advised them to
take that civilization to the regions where
it was Invented by the Father of Lies.
In this fashion the eloquent speaker
pleaded for the nationality of the Irish,
the Boers and the Filipinos. He denounced
the harlot of imperialism in every land In
which she has found place, and in closing
begged those that love their native land
and the home of their ancestors to be true
to it, faithful to its cause of freedem and
hopeful of its triumph.
A Splendid Celebration.
The celebration as planned by the
Knights of the Red Branch was of excep
tional excellence. The great hall was 1
temple of green and gold, the galleries
and walls hidden in heavy folds of the
brilliant colors. Flags were unfurled from
the chandeliers and the stage was a veri
table bower of green. In the very center,
flashing, trembling and gleaming in tiny
electric lights, was a harp and above it
that oft-repeated promise given in answer
to Emmet's plea that his epitaph be not
written until his country took her place
among the nation*.
Frank T. Shea, as chairman of the even
ing, opened the exercises in a brllllHnt
address. He spoke feelingly of the pa
triotic spirit which has Inspired the Irish
race fora ges and which found such fre
quent and disastrous consequences In the
martyrdom of heroes. In part Mr. Shea
epoke as follows:
"The pleasant duty devolves upon me
this evening to extend to you. onÂ© and
all, a hearty welcome in the name of the
Knights of the Red Branch of San Fran
cisco. We have assembled to participate
in appropriate exercises lh commemora-

CLASSIC LITERATURE: THE GREEK DRAMA.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
' GOLDEN AGES OF LITERATURE.
VIII. THE GREEK DRAMA.
BY CHARLES FORSTER SMITH. PH. D.
The drama is an original creaturo of
the Greek genius. Here, as in so irany
other forms of literature, the Greeks werÂ»
without models. According .to Aristotle
the Dorians claimed to have Invented the
drama, the Peloponnesians tragedy, the
Megarians comedy, and the very name
drama, by which the Dorians designated
action, was appealed to in proof.
The Greek drama grew out of the cele
bration of the- adventures and sufferings
of the god of wine, who was regarded as
the representative of the reproductive
powers of nature, his sufferings symboliz
ing the decay and sleep (cold and storms)
of nature In winter, his joys tbe reawak
ening of nature in the spring. Of the three
kinds of drama tragedy was named "goat
song," either because a goat was orlginai
ly the prize given, or, more probably, be
cause the chorus consisted of satyrs dis
guised as goats. Comedy means either
"village song". or more probably sons of
the comus, or revel band. The sacyr
drama, named from its chorus of satyrs
cles only seven each, and from Eurlplflpa
eighteen, the "Agamfinnon" and "Prome
theus" of Aeschylus and the "Antigone"
and "Oedipus Tyrannus" of Sophocles be
longing unquestionably to the greatest
dramas of all time.
In the "Prometheus" the Titan who in
defiance of the tyranny of Zeus has
brought fire to mortals suffers such pun
ishment as only a god could devise or a
demigod endure. Everything la on a co
lossal scale, the other characters being
gods or demigods, the chorus sea nymphs
and the scene the bare cliffs of the Cau
casus Mountains. What means Aeschy
lus found to effect a reconciliation Justi
fying both Prometheus and Zeus we can
only guess, since the other plays of the
trilogy are lost. But Aeschylus' reverent
piety would not have been satisfied with
anything less, and the whole was doubt
less fjuite different from Shelley's mag
nificent treatment of the same problem.
The "Agamemnon." which belongs to
the only extant complete trilogy, deals
with the murder of Agamemnon on hta
return from Troy by hU Queen, Clytem
nestra. The characters are all human,
and the character drawing is clear and
powerful. Clytemnestra outdoes Lady
Macbeth on her own ground, and the
scene in which the captive prophetess
Cassandra goes to her death Is without a
parallel for effectiveness in the Greek
drama. 'Â¦ The whole is a great master-

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial nÂ«ye:
'â¢Prurws attract the most attention, and
there are rumors of larg-e sales, with stories
of negotiations pending for still further large
files, but at this writing it has been impossi
ble to obtain jxisitive confirmation of the re
ports. On the Â«=pot buying is limited to small
nni-'re. rar<-iy above 25-box lots, though occa
sionally M> boxes are taken by one man. The
tc.tal MJji;ly -n the coast is reckoned at per
haps 37a cars, and It is expected that these
will ell rr.ove cut before the new crop comes.
About half a dozen cars have gone to Germany
of late, and there is eaid to be an Increasing
KrfrliFh inquiry.
"Raisins are dull, the present condition of
the market promising little improvement at
present. Foreign goods are held fairly firm,
but improvement is slow.
"Peaches are firm and tending upward, ow

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, March 12.â ThÂ« stock market
to-day showed very plainly the effects of the
reduction of the short Interest which accom
panied yesterday's sharp advance In prices.
While yesterday's covering movement was In
part the cause of the sharp advance it waa
alco the result of substantial buying which
was attributed to larga financial Interests.
This buying was not la evidence to-day. Lon
don also was disposed to take profits on the
news of the arrival of British forces near
Bloemfonteln. But notwithstanding the lack
of aggressive strength in the market the bears
showed therr.e-l-.es timid about making fresh
ventures. There was some pressure against
the list at times, especially Metropolitan,
Sugar. People's Gas, Steel Hoop and the New
York city stocks generally. Missouri Pacific
suffered from disappointment over the showing
made in the annual statement and Rubber was
raided down an extreme 2% points. These
and other declines were larpely recovered be
fore the close and in the final transactions a
marking up of prices showed that 'the
rliorts among the traders were having difficulty
in retting back the stock they had sold earlier
in the day. Offerings of Ftock on all reces
sions were In fact extremely light and there
v Tf points of strength which acted es sus
taining factors for the whole market, notably
Third Avenue, the Atchtaon stocks. New York
Central and Norfolk and Western preferred.
It was t!.uÂ« made manifest that while the
market waits on developments in the money
market for a- rise holders of atocks are not pre
pnred to make concessions to sell. Call money
did not command above 6 per cent and fell
to 3 per cent, but this was probably due to
Ibe cessation of stock market demand as myt-h
uf to any. new supply of funds. The locoes
by the banks to the sub-treasury since last
Friday already foot up $3,2*4,000, which is more
than half the remaining furplus over the legal
requireir.ant held by the banks. It Is evident,
therefor*, that relief from the operation cf
the currency law must come quickly If It Is
to prevent a t>inch In the money market. A
feeling of assurance waÂ» cautwd by an Inti
mation from Washington that the first pay
ments on account of bond premiums in the re
funding operation will be made from the sub
treasury and not from the Government de
poslte In national banks. The money market
is expected to show relief from this source
more quickly than from the nutting out of new
circulation. A striking feature of the day's
events was the sharp break in sterling ex
r-hange. demand sterling yielding % and cables
% Sn the pound. Considering the advance in
London discounts the selling cf rtocks for Lon
don account here and the reported lartce sub
scriptions in New York to the British loan
the course of sterling was the more remark
able. The explanation may be found In the
etatement of the merchandise exports from
New York frr the we*oc which were valued
at J18.245.999. against $13,670,162 In the preced
ing week and $9,878,229 In the corresponding

Nnu York Metal Market.
NEW YORK. March 13.â Business continues
very sla?k In the market for metals. There
was a decided decline In the price of tin, drop
ping from $34 50, quoted yesterday, to $32 25
(a 32 75, closing weak at those figures, in sym
pafliy with a Â£6 decline In that metal at Lon
don. Plelron warrants were very dull. Lake
copper unchanged, at $16 25 nominal; lead, $4 70
@4 75, closed steady; spelter eased off 2% points,
closing easy, with prices $4 62% bid and $4 67%
asked. The brokers' price for lead was 14 43
and for. copper $16 CO.
CHICAGO, March IS.â The crowd In the corn
pit was much greater than it has been at any
other time for a year, not even excepting yes
terday, when the 2-cent bulge made the coarse
cereal the cynosure of speculative eyes. The
price was controlled by two influences at
various timesâ sales for profit and covering by
shorts. May opened %c over yesterday. The
excitement then began. Longs who bought
months ago came into the ' pit and took as
much prollt as they deemed advisable at pres
ent. It was estimated that many hundreds of
thousands of dollars were taken out of sales
to-day. Meanwhile May was shooting down
from first figures to 37Vic, a drop of l@l%o
from the opening. At the decline the excite
ment abated to a degree and shorts 'began to
protect themselvea against another ascent.
Under this influence and with the light coun
try offerings and higher cables in mind May
recovered gradually to 3"T4Â®3Sc. Later the
market reacted to 37%e. where it steadied and
closed %Â®%c under yesterday.
The wheat- market was quiet and rather
heavy, subordinate to corn all ' day. May
opened %c over yesterday at 66%<g66%c, in
fluenced by higher cables from Liverpool and
from Paris and with the corn strength. The
break in corn, lower late cables and the heavy
Northwest receipts, together with profit-taking
by traders caused a reaction following the
openlng.^May declining from, 66% c, which the
market Touched shortly after the opening, to
65%i@C5T4c. The close waa I heavy. May %@>/>c
lower at 65% c.
The oats market showed some activity and
strength early. Influenced by corn and wheat.
However, with the break In corn the market
declined and closed rather weak. May closed
%Â®'ic under yesterday. :.. - . ,
The experience in provisions' â¢ was much
similar to that- in .corn â considerable proflt
taklng on. one hand and covering by shorts on
the other. 5 It was a fairly active market, ap
parently < inclined Â¦ toward . easiness. May pork
closed 10c under yesterday. May lard 2%c lower
and May ribs 2%@5c depressed.

Dewitt. They thereupon filed a com
plaint In the United States Circuit Court
asking that Dewitt be enjoined from fur
ther hindering them from carrying out
the contract
Dewitt will get under the contract one
tenth of the profits of the mine.
LET HUNTINGTON
HANDLE RELIEF
BUREAU CONTEST
Kruttschnitt Believed to
Have Passed the Buck
to His President.
Active Work Being Done by South
ern Pacific Employes ln-Prep
'V'"" aration for a Possible
I Struggle.
Â¦ â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. March 13.
The hurried and announced departure
of General Manager Kruttschnitt of the
Southern Pacific Company last week for
the East has led railroad men In OaklanJ
to the belief that the contest over the re
lief bureau scheme will be referred direct
ly to President Huntlngton upon his ar
rival here in April. Employes are of tht*
opinion that the general manager vua
astute enough to pass the responsibility
for any trouble to C. P. Huntington hiir.
self. who has been given credit for in
augurating the Insurance plan on hi*
roads. His closest subordinates on the
Pacific Coast have been chary of meddling
much with the proposition.
Jt has been noticeable since the or
ganized opposition became strongly devel
oped that the headquarters officials have
not been desirous of meeting the em
ployes' committees. In fact, before the,.
could be properly organized the word wa.-Â»
sent forth that the general manager had
left the State. Kruttschnitt departed th*
night before the grievance committee waa
organized which is to represent the tiv^
large brotherhoods before the Southern
Pacific officials. The men were disappoint -
ed when they learned of the general man
ager's departure. His absence delays a
settlement of the contest, or at least a'i
official presentation of the demands of the
men.
This cannot now. be accomplished until
after Kruttschnitt's return, and it is sup
posed he will arrive with the rest of th<Â»
Huntlngton party. That thÂ« officials real
ize there is much strength to the oppo
sition which has steadily developed to tho
scheme goeÂ« without saying. Every divi
sion superintendent on the Southern Pa
cific system has reported that the men
are dissatisfied, and will at least demand
a radical modification of the terms of thÂ»
proposition.
During the interim tho organized broth
erhoods are Quietly but actively securing
reports as to the sentiment of the men
throughout the system. It is known that
the two centers in this State outside of
Oakland, namely. Sacramento and Los
Angeles, are being canvassed, that when
tho grievance committee shall go before
the, officials they will know exactly what
strength Is behind them.
Word has been received in Oakland that
the several thousand employes in' thÂ»
Sacramento railroad shops are practically
unanimous In their opposition to the in
surance scheme, and that they will abso
lutely refuse under any circumstances to
Join the bureau. Reports from Loa An
geles indicate a similar condition of af
fairs. In the Oakland yards it is reported"
that many of the trainmen and minor
employes ara belnjj given assurance that
in the event of serious trouble they will
be taken care of If they shall stand flrnv
to fight the Introduction of the scheme.
In an unofficial way word has been sent
to Oakland that it will be useless for th<*
railroad men's committees to make an;*
move until after Huntington's arrival.
Realizing this situation the main com
mittee Is simply preparing its statement
to cover every phase of the objections
they have to offer. It Is certain that n<*
definite move will be made until aftT
April 1. The utmost secrecy la being,ob
served by the brotherhoods. Their officer.'*
simply stand on the proposition that thev
are not yet ready to make public any o"
their plans. What may be done Is merely
a matter of speculation. The trend of at
fair* Is, however, to force a direct issua
with the company officials, and to wait
for future developments.
WAGNER CONCERT
GREATLY ENJOYED
THE public is exhibiting an increased
interest in the Wagnerian concerts
as the season draws to a close and
the audience at the California last
night was fairly good, although not
commensurate with the value of the
entertainment offered.
"Siegfried" and "Gotterdammerung"
*rere the themes of Mr. Damrosch's dis
course, and the vocal illustratior* of Mme.
Gadski, Mr. Bispham and Mr. Schott. The
fame charm and symmetry that charac
terize Mr. Damrosch's lectures was again
pleasantly in evidence, and his freedom
from cut-and-drled formulae was shown
in the freshness with which he endowed
the themes he had already treated at his
afternoon recitals.
I am moved to say. however, that the
alterations and abridgements of bis dis
course were a distinct loss, and In spite
of the vocal contributions by Mme. Gad
ski and Mr. Bispham the Interest in the
second elucidation of "Siegfried" and
"Gotterdammcrung" was materially cur
tailed by the omission of numerous Inci
dents of the dramatic development and
passages in the score that Mr. Dam
rosch inserted In his more exhaustive ex
planatory recitals.
In handling thus briefly the complex
schemes of Wagner's most highly devel
oped music dramas, it is not an easy task
to decide what shall be presented and
what passed over, but on^the whole Mr.,
Damrosch succeeded in Riving what was
essential to the themes and musical pur
pose of his subjects, and if there be any
cause for dissatisfaction it is in the fact
that we were denied the enjoyment of
some of his interpretations on the piano
which we have learned to like as much
as any of the factors of these delightful
entertainments.
The excerpts of the evening did not af
ford Mr. Bispham the best opportunity to
display his powers, although in "Hagan's
Call to the Glbichungs" his noble voice
was h<>ard to the best advantage.
Mme. Gadski sang portions of Brun
hllde's music with good effect and a happy
condition of voice. There was frequently
evident in nor singing an admirable art
and intelligence and a refinement equal if
not superior to that which has given value
and charm to her previous efforts.
Mr. Schott sang the part of Siegfriedâ
badly. PORTER GARNETT.

conclusion that it was the use of coffee.
So we abandoned the coffee and took
up Postum Cereal Food Coffee, which
I had seen advertised in the daily pa-
pers.
"Since using it I have, to my great
surprise, improved wonderfully. Hus-
band has gained II pounds in two
months since he left off coffee and be-
gan the use of Postum. He sleeps
soundly at night now, which he does
not remember having done for several
years before on account of nervousness.
Â¦It is remarkable that people go on in
ill health and do not discover the cause
of the trouble. . - .
'"You may depend upon it we know
how to make Postum good, and that is
easy if one" will use a sufficient amount
and boil it long enough. It is really an
elegant and delicious drink. I don t
want my name to appear in the papers,
if you should publish this testimonial."

LIPTON CAN BRING
BUT ONE CHALLENGER
Sir Thomas Must Conform to the
Rules Governing Races for the
America's Cup.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 13.â The purpose of
Sir Thomas Lipton in the 'matter of his
next challenge for the America's cup
caused considerable comment among lead
hie, yachtsmen to-day. In. the first place
Sir Thomas', decision to bring over, two
boats, the Shamrock and the new Erin,
if allowed to do so by the New York
Yacht Club, evoked smiles and negative
shakes of the heads. All thought the
deed of gift amounted to something and
j If it does Sir Thomas would not be given
the club's consent to send his two boats
; here for the purpose set forth. The pro
vision of the deed which covers this point
is as follows:
"Accompanying the ten months notice
of challenge there must be sent the name
of the owner and the certificate of the
name, rig and following dimensions of the
challenging vessel, namely: Length on
load water line, beam at load water line
and extreme beam and draught of water."
If, therefore, notice of challenge and
the name, etc., of the vessel are required
by the New York Yacht Club, as usual,
then Sir Thomas' purpose of trying out
his two boats off Sandy Hook and naming
the challenging vessel at the last hour
would fall.
The New York Yacht Club, of course,
has waived the dimension clause of the
provision except in the matter of the total
water-line length of . the challenger, but
that concession, it was held, had no bear
ing on the balance of the requirements
noted. Â¦

PUBLIC WORKS BOARD
CALLED TO ACCOUNT
Addressed Upon the Subject of the
Shameful Condition of Van Nes3
Avenue by a Prominent
Citizen.
Bolld citizens are beginning to rise
against Phelan misrule and the supine in
competency of his servile boards, the
members of which look wise, record Phe
lan's will in making appointments and
straightway forget that they have a duty
to perform. While the city nightly floun
ders in darkness and thugs and sandbag
gers are thereby Invited to commit unlaw
ful and violent acts there are other condi
tions which are giving rise to general in
dignation. The streets were never in as
bad condition as they are now. Dirty, neg
lected, shamefully falling into ruin for
lack of Intelligent care on the part of the
Board of Public Works, the highways and
the very byways cry out against the
shortcomings of those who were to regen
erate the elty and brlns? about a muni
cipal millennium when the charter should
be put into effect. The facts are notor
ious. Every class of citizens has reason
to feel angry â storekeepers, teamsters,
pedestrians, in fact everyone, and a rod
is in pickle which will soon bÂ«Â» sharply
Jaid upon the backs of Phelan office
hoWers.
Within tho past few days complaints
have been common concerning the shame
ful condition of Van Ness avenue. A com
munication has been addressed to the
Board of Public Works and the Superin
tendent of Streets by A. M. Speck which
voices the sentiments of many others on
the subject. The communication is as
follows:
To the Board of Public Works and
the Superintendent of StreetsâGentle
men: I respectfully desire to call your
attention to the frightful condition of
Van Ness avenue and the stone cross
ings in front of St. Ignatius and St.
Mary's churches and at Bush street
and Van Ness avenue.
The streets are in a shamefully neg
lected condition, and I trust you will
pive your immediate attention to

the principal downftwn thoroughfares
for families, church pÂ«^>ple and busi
ness men. Respectfully,
A. M. SPECK.
The same sort of complaint is made con
â¢ernin* the downtown business streets.
'Whpn," it is asked, "will the Board of
Public Works pay attention to the real
n*^*ds of thÂ»> city, even if they have to
for*gr> the luxury of adopting so many
resolutions?"
This calls to mind that there is a certain
plafv? that is paved with good resolutions,
but it is not San Francisco, and all the
resolutions that the Board of Public
Works can adopt, good or otherwise, will
not patch even a crosswalk. The time is
ripe for a crusade on this subject, for the
public is fully aroused.

to her, often in the presence of their'lit
tle daughter' Phyllis,* "who Ib now ifour

Mrs. Stanford Returns to This City
' â¢ After Placing University Con
tracts in the East.
. Mrs. Jane . Stanford returned from the
East yesterday morning and will go down
to Palo Alto after spending a few days at
her home on.Californla street, in this city.
The "recent "reports that came from New
York regarding the healthof the univer
sity's patroness have been greatly exag
gerated. . The pneumonia of which so
much was said was nothing more than a
slight attack of grip," which while , un
pleasant was not at all serious. The cor
respondents in the East sent out reports
that made it appear as though Mrs.
Stanford was on the verge of dissolution.
These statements were as unpleasant to
the lady as they were disquieting' to her
friends.
9 While In the East Mrs. Stanford found
plenty of time to attend to the business
connected with the university. She ha^
given to Mr. Lambe, the cousin of Lambs
who designed the Dewey memorial arch,
orders for the memorial stained-glass
windows which are intended for the new
chapel. Lambe has the reputation of
being the best church decorator in the
United States, and it is expected that ho
will further add to his reputation by the
work he will do on the windows. ,
Orders -for the majority of the statues
of the twelve . apostles which will sur
round the nave of the church have also
been placed, and it will not be long before
some of them arrive at their destination.
Mrs. Stanford will remain on the coast
until May or June, when- she will leave
for Europe and the Paris Exposltion> It
Js her intention to remain in the French
capital for a month or two and then jour
ney In a leisurely manner to the Holy
Land by way of the Mediterranean. She
does not yet know how long she will re
main away, but she will probably be ab
sent the better part of a year, and while
on the Continent' she will keep a sharp
look-out for any works of art that may
help to ornament her beloved university.

DOZEN SMALL BOYS
GET DRUNK ON WINE
Police Are Trying to Find the Person
Whc Sold It to Them in Order
to Punish Him. "; . >
The police are searching for the person
who sold a gallon of wine to about a dozen
small boys lest Sunday. They took tho
wine with them to Mill Valley and drank
till they were all Intoxicated. One cf the
boj'B, named Dunn, living on Brannan
street, was carried home and drugs had
to be administered to him to get him out
of his drunken stupor.
Policeman Koegel. who has been special
ly detailed on the case, discovered some
of the boys In a vacant lot on Brarnan
street, between Sixth and Seventh, yester
day afternoon. The ringleader. Joseph
Lahey. 15 years of age. living at 709 Bran
nan street, had a big revolver and was
playing cowboy by firing at the fences. He
was arrested and booked at the City
Prison for a public instltuion. He was at
one time an Inmate of the Boys rÂ»nd

He positively refuses to say where he got

WILLIAM J. BRYAN IS
COMING TO THIS COAST
Democratic Standard-Bearer to De
liver a Series of 'Addresses â San ,
Francisco Given Overlook.
William J. Bryan, the probable stand
ard-bearer of the Democratic party, will
tour this coast in his own Interests dur
ing the latter part of the present month.'
He so informed J. J. Dwyer, Democratic
National Committeeman, In a letter which'
the latter received yesterday. The visit
of the distinguished leader of the De
mocracy will be fraught with deep inter
est to the followers of his standard, as
he will devote a considerable part of his
speeches to the questions of expansion
and imperialism. His utterances on the
subject will be awaited with curiosity, as
they will be his latest thoughts. Mr.
Bryan will not gratify his local followers
by raising his voice during his brief stay
In ti-s city. He is satisfied with the im
pression he made while here In September,
ISSB, and is certain that the local Dem
ocrats will not have forgotten the words
of alleged .wisdom he dropped in - their
midst at that time.
According to the letter received by Mr.
Dwyer, Mr. Bryan will arrive In Sacra
mento on March 26, and will address the
natives that night, and Immediately after
the meeting will leave for Oregon. He
will spend two weeks touring that State
and Washington, anu is scheduled to re
turn to San Francisco on April 7. He
will not tarry long, but will "just drop In
in an off-hand sort of way" to greet the
locai leaders of Democracy. He will
leave on the night of his arrival for
Fresno, and will deliver an address at
that city on the night of his arrival there.
At the close of the meeting Mr. Bryan
will depart for the southern part of the
State, as he has an appointment to speak
at San Dieco on the night of April 9. The
following afternoon he will address the
citizens of San Bernardino, and the next
evening he will be heard by the people of
Los Angeles. He will depart on April 11
fcr Phoenix, Arizona, where he will bow
a few seeds In the hope that they will
blossom at the next election.
Mr. Dwyer and Seth Mann are making
the arrangements for these, meetings.
DESPONDENT SOLDIER
COMMITS SUICIDE
Went Into the Bathroom of the Con
valescent Hospital and Cut His
: -,-Â» Throat.
Alfred .Kennedy, a private of Company
F of. the Ninth Infantry, committed sui
cide in the convalescent hospital at the
Presidio yesterday about noon. He cut
his throat with a razor. '
Kennedy was one of the men 'who came
home from the Philippines on the trans
port Grant, which arrived here March 5.
He was suffering from rheumatism, but
as soon as he landed here he began to re
cover, and a week ago he was transferred
to the convalescent hospital. He had not
been paid for two months before he start
ed home, and when ho arrived here he
learned that his descriptive) list had not
been Bent on with him, and consequently
he could draw 110 money until it could be
secured from his company commander.
This would take nearly two months more,
and as Kennedy had no money, he be
came very despondent.
He Bald nothing about ending his trou
bles, so no one suspected anything wron?
when he went into the bathroom of the
barracks where the convalescent hospital
is located. Some one I standing near the
door heard him groan soon after he went
In and then heard his body fall, so he
â¢pushed open the door and looked in. Â¦ He
saw Kennedy lying in the bathtub, with
his-head nearly severed from his body. It
was evident at once that nothing could be
done to save his life, and within a lew
moments he died. -: i .-Â¦â¢â¢-
Kennedy enlisted in the army from Ala
bama, where he said he had relatives. Ilia
body will be shipped there. s
It was reported at the Presidio yester
day, that Private Osborn of Battery N,
Third â¢ ArtHlery, stationed at Alcatraz,
was . found dead In hla bed yesterday,
morning at reveille. It Is supposed heart
disease. was what caused his death.
There was a small fire In the quarters of
Light Battery C of f the Third Artillery
yesterday. The light battery occupiep tiie
third or middle building of the row of
brick barracks. Some one had left a cigar
or cigarette smoldering ', among 1 some
papers, and they took fire. There wp.s a

Session of the Board of Regents.
Superabundance of Gold for
a Medal Proves a
Problem.
At a meeting of the Board of Regents
of the University of California yesterday
afternoon President Wheeler made an an
nouncement that will gratify the people
of the State. He said Mrs. Hearst was
engaged in collecting material for the
archaelogical museum at Berkeley, and
he was authorized to announce to the Re
gents that Dr. George A. Reisner has been
employed to conduct archaelogical work
In Egypt for the University of California.
He is engaged for the term of five years.
Dr. Uhle has been engaged to conduct
archaeological work In South America and
Yucatan for the term of live years.
Dr. Philip Mills Jones has been engaged
to conduct the same kind of work in Cal
ifornia. New Mexico and Arizona. -Both
Dr. Reisner and Dr. Uhle were engaged
one year ago, and favorable reports of
their researches have been received.
Dr. Alfred Emerson, recently proff.BSOr
of archaeology at Athens, will confer with
Mrs. Hearst about undertaking explora
tions in Greece and Etruria.
President Wheeler remarked that Mrs.
Htarst accepted the responsibility -for all
expenses of the work accomplished and
the explorations In view. â¢ .
The Kepents expressed their sense of
gratitude for Mrs. Hearst's generosity by
b. vote of thanks.
The Regents in attendance were: Wil
liam T. Wallace (presiding), Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, Albert Miller. K. A. Den'c k*.
John E. Hudd. Dr. Chester Rowell, Dr.
Ocorge C. Pardee H. S. Foote, Lieutcnanr
Governor Jacob H. Neff, Speaker \ldse
Anderson. Charles W. Slack. Mrs. Hearst,
Gerome Houghton, James A. Waymire
and J. B. Reinsitin.
There was some diversion yesterday
from the routine of granting and extend
ing furloughs "without impairment of
salary." 10 the gifted professors of the
groat institution of learning at Berkeley.
Several of the highly esteemed !n the se
lect circles of higher education who are
now romping around the Old World, wait
ing for the Paris Exposition to open, were
of course accorded extensions of time.
Professors Le Oonte. Rising and Strong
ham were accredited as representatives
of the university to various congresses
fa the old country.
When a proposition was submitted to
give Professor Bailey a leave to loiter for
three months without loss of salary Re
gent Fooie called for the reading of a
rule regarding furloughs. The rule en
tities a professor who has served seven
years to one year's leave of absence
"without impairment of salary." It was
found that Mr. Bailey was ehy one year
Â«i the seven, but the board In its liberal
ity Fuspcndt-d the rule and granted the
leave.
This expression, "without Impairment
of salary." is not local. President Wheeler
imported it from Cornell. The elite of
the faculty prefer it to the hackneyed
term, "without loss of pay."
The rtgents were neither entertained
nor instructed by a communication from
Marsden Manson, a Commissioner of
Mayor Phelan's precious Board of Public
Works. As the Board of Works is doing
nothing for San Francisco perhaps the
Commissioner fancied that a letter de
ploring the faults of the constitution of
California would be acceptable to the
publir. He advised the university pro
fessors and students to apply themselves
to the task of framing a new constitu
tion. The conservation of waste water
was mentioned. The voluminous docu
tr.er.t was referred to a committee con
sisting of Wallace. Foote and Reinstein.
The board was highly entertained ovc-r a
relating to the gold medal
which la annually awarded to the most
distinguished graduate. In the days long
gone, when pold was plentiful and hlsjher
education far away, enterprising citizens
of California "chipped in" and raised a
modal fund. It was provided in the gift
to th<- university that the Interest accru
ing from the fund. should annually be ex
pended in th<? i urchase of a gold medal
to be presented to the most advanced stu
dent. It happens this year that the
amount available for the medal is $240.
The academic ci-uncil holds that a medal
containing more than $109 worth of gold
would be too large for the most distin
guished of brilliant students. It was sug
gested therefore that so much of the
money as would bp necessary to procure
a suitable medal should be appropriated
to that purpose and the cash surplus In
the fund be tnned over to the medal
scholar, to be used by him or her in the
pursuit of still higher education.
The discussion did turn upon questions
of propriety as applied to the size of med
als. Californians. and especially the ar
gonauts, will readily agree that gold to the
value of $240 is not too much for a medal
designed for presentation to a chief of a
fire department or the captain of a big
steamship. The academic council, how
ever, holding that knowledge Is more pre
cious than gold, fancied that a small-sized
token would signalize the achievement in
scholarship, and leave the champion some
thing to spend for future Intellectual ex
pansion. .
The lawyers, Wallace. Foote. Slack and
Waymire. did. not discuss the ethics In
volved. Judge Wallace cares for neither
monuments or medals, but he noted the
terms of the medal trust provide that the
money annually available must bo
used to purchase, a gold medal.
Lawyer Foote feared that the trust
might be declared void If there were
any departure from the terms of the
contract. When it began to dawn upon
the minds of President Wheeler and other
Ilogents that the prize scholar of ISM)
would have to sport a medal as big as the
bigrest worn by a champion prize fighter
there was apprehension that the bounty
of the pencrous old Callfornians would
prove embarrassing. The cloud of appre
hension was, however, quickly dispelled
by the Fagaclty of Albert Miller, the
banker and savant of the board. He sug
gested that the medal should be of ap
propriate else and the residue of the gold
FhouJd be wrought Into the case. He even
estimated that the holder could do with
the ca?e as he or she pleased. Surely
lieutenant Governor Neft gained the im
pression that the medal scholar In dire
distress would be Justified under the law
of self-preservation in pawning the case.
Tet Mr. Miller did not go that far In sug
gestion. The lawyers perceiving that the
lsw quoted had no. bearing on the case,
accepted the advice of Mr. Miller. Doubt
less the Academic Council will be in
structed to Invest the available money In
a medal and a case.
Before the board adjourned Professor C
L Corey was excused from all work for
one year by relinquishment of his salary.
He has accepted the position of consult
ing engineer in an electrical company.
President Wherler Is anxious that the
professor's relations to the university
shall rot terminate.

Highbinder Murderer, Held in the

â¢ * â
Murder was In the air' throughout the
Chinese quarter last night. So serious did
the situation look at one time that the
Chief of Police detached an extra body to
the scene to assist the two squads already
there, and ordered the squad under Ser
geant Shea to discontinue its efforts at
capturing gamblers and keep a close
watch for highbinders. ,
Early in the evening groups of high
binders belonging to the Hop ' Sing Tong
gathered at various places on the streets
and prepared to commit murder. Their
determination resulted from the action of
the Suey Sing Tons In sending trailers
after Jung Ah Lock, who was located
In the salt marshes near Nlles yesterday.
Lock was a member of a faction affiliated
with the Hop Sings in the present war
and they , determined to get revenge for
the action. Another matter that hurt the
Hop Sings also was the recent acquittal
of a Suey Sing man who killed one of their
members at Sacramento. When it became
known that the Hop Sings were on the
warpath for the Suey Sings, the latter im
mediately gathered all of their available
hatchet men together and a clash seemed
imminent for a time.
The police^ were given the information
and immediately reported the seriousness
of the situation at headquarters and
asked for more help. This will be given
them with all possible dispatch, and Chi
natown was' well patrolled last evening.
Yesterday morning. Sergeant Shea, in
company with Judge Conlan and an in
terpreter, visited the City . and County
Hospital and Issued a warrant to Jue
Hok, the highbinder shot by Jung Ah
Lock. Immediately afterward the Ser
geant started for the salt marshes near
Niles, where the Chinese were said to
have Lock a- captive. When the" officer
arrived lie lound that the much wanted
man had evaded his guard during the
night and escaped: It appears that when
the Chinese captured Lock they requested
a town constable to place him under ar
rest. This the constable refused to do.
and it was due to this that the man is still
an outlaw. - â¢
