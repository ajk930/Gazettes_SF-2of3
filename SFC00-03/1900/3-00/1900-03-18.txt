"The regulations of. some universities do

J men and, the^'environments are often ?n
Â§ tirely opposite. "In" one" of the clubs the
living. of its members is on a most scien
tific, economical basis. ' There are six
: members who rent a small cottage within
:a few blocks of the university. The mem
bers do their own cooking, washing aal
' house-cleaning, and thereby reduce the
living expenses to the minimum.
They average not more than" JlO each a
month. All take turns at the various de
tails of work. -One will, act as cook for a
month, ' another - washes ; the ' dishes, an
other attends -to 'the- buying,* and- so on,

call upon for money they work at odd
Jobs about the university at 2S cents an,
hour. Th#y attend college regularly and
are often among the best students and
'very popular with their classmates. There
have been Instances where one of these
club men was a leader in class 'politics or
in athletics. Of course the .members of
"other clubs are better off and live in the
â¢ same manner as the average student.
As an instance of the other extreme, thÂ«
members -of -the fraternities are often
compelled to pay $40 to JoO a month for liv
ing expenses. -, The ' majority of "fraterni
ties, however, are managed on a basis as
low as the best boarding'houses, averag
ing about- $30.' Each fraternity employs
from one to thr*><? servants, according to
the size. of the house and the number of
members. A manager, one of the mem
bers, is elected annually, who takes entire
chargcof, the finances. He buys the pro
visions,, hires the servants and attends to
regulating the monthly Mils.

large as their pockets will permit- They

Each fraternity, and there are fourteen,
averages a membership of about twenty,
ten of whom are resident membersâ that

depends the support of the fraternity.
One of- the most interesting features of
fraternity life .la the rivalry which ex
ists. " At the opening of the fall term,
when the freshmen enter, there is always
a struggle for the best and most available
men.' Often a very good man will be in
vited to become a member of several or-
ganizations. Then It is that the fight
becomes Interesting. Each fraternity will
present facts which it thinks will influ

As each fraternity is characteristic of a
certain type of man,' thr- fortunate fresh
men Joins the crowd which he thinks most
congenial or has the most influence on
him. ' This is called "rushlns," and is

and after a long, hard struggle, dragged
the corpse out from the cabin and Into
the coffin and covered it with a blanket.
I then pulled the sleigh about twenty-flve
feet from the door and nailed the cover
on the box.
Kverything was completed by seven in
'the evening, when I tound myself ex
hausted. We were all . heart sick and
Karle was saying, "I suppose I shall be
the next." I tried to comfort and quiet
him, but he grew more excited, and by
midnight he was raving.
I loved Eano and I tried so hard to save'
him. He was a sturdy fellow of twenty-
three years. He always took the heavy
end of tasks. Of all the party he could
least be spared. But all my nursing was
to no purpose. On the morning of the 27th
he gave a few long sighs and passed
away, only cne day after Amsden, his
uncle..
As May advanced McDonald grew bet
ter and I worse. We were In need of fresh
meat, but unable to hunt for It, for al-
how good !t tasted after a long winter's
living on bacon, hard tack and canned
food! ; â¢
We were in need of water. Once I had
cooked some corn meal in the dirty water
contained in our wash dish,. But one day
Mac Insisted upon going outride for' some,
and the effort was too much for him.
After lying outside In the rain nearly all
day. he at last succeeded In reaching the
door \/ith the wattr. .but could get no fur
ther. I mannpred to help him into bed.
when file of h.'s fainting spells came on
and in the night he passed away.
I was alone! There was less Incentive
for me to keep up my strength, yet I
never ceased to light for my life. I was
livjng on the most miserable food, not be
j cause I had no better, but because I v.-as
* not able to prepare anything more than
soaked hard tack. When I managed to
stew some mush and peaches one day I
thousht them a rare treat.
June had come when Mac died. How
damp and cold was that cabin! There had
been no fire In it for fifteen days, though
but some small p!ece3 from the breast,
which I broiled over a candle. With the
feathers I had made a smudge to drive out
the mosquitoes.
With many ups and many more downs. I
grew better as June advanced. The last
day of the month found me out In tho
warm, fresh air. a robin for my compar.
ion. After a cheerful day I slept well, un
til a visitor appeared, at 1 in the morninp.
He was a Kr^ut red-brown bear. He ap
peared and reappeared, making hlmsei?
easily discernible through the cracks of
the wait. My .first impulse was to grab
my rifle nnd shoot. How could I miss such
a prand opportunity? Off came my bed
clothes, when suddenly remembering irv
helpless condit'on Icame to the conclusion
that should I kill him on the first shot I
should be safe, but failing that I was at
the mercy of an irresistible enemy, who
could In a very short time destroy me to
satisfy his hunger. And. further, should
I kill him. he would be near my cabin a:i>l
would in time become obnoxious. Fearing
that he might demolish ray cached fruit
and bacon, I whistled three times, but
could not frighten him. With my 3S-Co!t
drawn from under my plllhw I wan about
to fire, when I considered again. He
might become angry and make a tour of
Inspection. When he finally wandered
away I could n<jt sleep, fearing his returr..
Nevertheless 1 had reached the decision
that a bold breck for life must be made
Immed'ately. Hence, on the morning of
July 21 I commenced storing necessary
provisions and protective covering. I
crawled, and propelled my package*,
pushing them ahead of me with a stick
to the river bank, which, being shaped
like a levee, and five feet hl<h perpen
dicularly. I could ascend only by a fltght
of steps cut to accommodate the condi
tion of my legs and body*
At last, after an encounter with wasps,
I reached my beat, but found her water
loggred. It took several days of work to
make ncr river-worthy. It was on the
night of the 23d that I was ready, with
my cargo of bread, water, dried fruit,
bacon, a revolver, a rubber blanket,
crutch, chair, ax. blocks and tackle. Bs-
Bides these things I had a tent and other
necessaries for campir.gr. *
- I floated down the Black. The short
Arctic night was cold, and still, too. save
Â¦when a- minx, frightened by the swoop of
a pull, swam In a panic across the stream.
I shn and captured the little fellow.
At 7 a. m. of the 25th a happy sight met
my gaze: Indians hunting and flshlnjr. In
exchange for fruit nnd crackers they gave
me fish cooked in moose fat. - Early next
morning one of them delivered me safely
intp the care of some Americans who
were flshirs on the Porcupine River.
These men kindly conveyed me to Fort
Yukon, where "the boys" cafried me bod
ily, to the Mission Home. I was finally
sent to the Circle City Hospital, where
good care was given me at the rate of $3
per day.
In the hideousness of disease, with my
180 pounds reduced to IQO. my hair and
beard grown like a wild man's. I was a
pitiable sight. I was shaved and made to
look like a convict. After two weeks'
treatment the calf of my leg measured
nine and one-half inches In circumference,
little left but bone. My principal remedy
being vegetables, the doctor gave me fre

"I think the saddest experiences I had
were in Cuba. Yellow fever carried off sO
many of th*> boys. There was a hospital
especially for the yellow fever cases, but
any number of patients in our hospital
developed yellow fever. I was the only
nurse in the hospital who was not im
mune to yellow fever. I never gave a
thought to the danger or r.hrank from the
yellow fever ea*cs. and fortunately I did
not Baccunsb to it."
Miss Wheeler fays that she nursed dur
ing the yellow fever, although not im
mune, as though It were the usual thing
tar a young woman to leave the comfoiU
and pleasures Â°' Washington for a life in
c fever stricken cam;*. It wpuld be ira
poMlble to exaggerate her rr.od'-st simplic
ity or the c-fiaim of her soft Southern
accent. Annie Early Wheeler is n.jt par
ticularly.pretty at first sight, lih<>- is "just

look even more fK-ndcr tlian she really is.
A wisp of light-brown hair frames the
Bensttire fare, that grows en you until you
wonder that you Â«lid not discover at once
how delicately pretty it is.
Miss Wheeler insets ihet sh* defcTVea
no credit for giving a year of her. .if* to
lhÂ« needy coMlcrs. "I had a father and
brother at the front," she say*, "and that
was my first reason for wishing tc go.

Then we all looked away until lOn
Wheeler broke the pilence with "Are you

clipped in his plate and Miss Wheeler !ov-
ingly laid her cheek against her father's
head, saying. "I'll cover up the bald ipct,
daddy, dear."
"Do you know." said Miss Wheeler, "the

since they had , never been near the
plague."
"You shouldn't criticize the officials; they
know what they are about," answered
General Joe Wheeler, with the true sol
dier's instinct to obey. And like a truo
soldier's daughter Miss Annie Wheeler
saluted.
"I dread to think of my picture going
into the paper," snid Miss Wheeler. "But
you won't write anything, will you?
There really isn't anything to tell, for I've
not done anything worth talking about."
Other lips told the rest of the story
when Miss Wheeler was called out of tho
room. "Annie Is the most modest girl,"'
said Miss Elizabeth Davis, who has been
visiting in Manila and is traveling with
the Wheelers to her home In New York.
The general and Ms daughter are both
very fond of Miss Elizabeth, although sha
is not a niece, as has been stated. "An
nie says she hasn't done anything, yet
while we girls were complaining of the
Manila heat and dancing and frittering
away our time she was nursing the sick
without even stopping to .rest after her
siege with the yellow fever in. Cuba.
'"Miss Wheeler was the only nurse who
worked entirely without pay. The other
Rtti Cross nurses were all under salary,
but though she lived their life tind did
their work Â»he never asked for or received

ii black, a bit of crape on bonnet and
sleeve hinting at her story. We helped
her into t"he elevator, and it was a grate
ful "Thank you" with a rich c-oating of
the brogue of Erin that she gave the
artist.
We waited outside while the little old
lacy went timidly into the Wheeler apart?
mems. The boll boy caught a glimpse
cf her. "Thai's about the twentieth to
day." ho said. "They all think she's got
some message from their tons. She sees
*em all. too; and lets her other callers go.
Miss Wheeler's a real lady, she is."
"She"s a blessed angel," said the little
ola lady when she came out and a tear
fell on the big bucch of violets that she
brought with her from the flo-aer-laden
room.
"I'm truly afraid of newspaper people,"
laughed Miss Wheeler as she greeted us.
â¢'They don't bite." reassured her father.
"No, but they write such awfulâurn.-exa
ggerations." The idea that Miss Wheeler
could never have come to such a conclu
eion from reading the Sar. Francisco pa
pers was merrily scouted. "Why." she
said, "I've seen two or three accounts in
the papers here of my meeting the Sultan
of Sulu, whom I never saw 3nd never ex
pect to see."
While the artist was busy with his
camera Miss Wheeler *poke of her ex
periences at the front. "It was a sacred
<Juty and pleasure to me." she said. "My
hospital work will always be the sweetest
and saddest memory in my life. 1 fol

and he pointed with his whip to whare in
the distance the two divisions were gal
loping up to join their comrades.
The traveler smiled grimly as he p - .:t
away his rifle and pistols, covering them
carefully from the snow. "That Tas a
narrow shave," he said. "How much far
ther to the posting station?"
"Yonder, your Excellency," and the man
pointed to where, far ahead, a little grouo
of buildings, covered with snow, was
barely visible on the white landscape.
Another half hour brought the sledge
safely into the yard of the posting-house;
and the traveler hurried Into the butldir.g.
."Some supper, a bed and a team of your
best horses by the break cf day." he said
to the host, a stout man, clad in ilir?y
sheepskin garments.
"The supper and the bed, barm: but as
to the horses, I regret that it is impossi
ble. My last troika has just gone on
ahead, and I shall not have fresh ones
until to-morrow at midday."
"How?" cried the traveler, raising h!s
hand, while his face became a fiery red.
"Did I not send you word yesterday that I
should want your best horses?"
"It was your Excellency, was It?" asked
the host,, scratching his head In a per
plexed manner.
"Dimitri Varanzoff." said the traveler.
"Ah, yes. , That was the name they
gave."
"Do you mean to say, son of a serf, that
you have glveh my team to others?"
"I have offended unwittingly, bi:rin.
They gave the name and 1 gave the horses
âan hour or more ago."
"And who are they? Speak,, slave "
"The party that arrived last before your
Excellency. Their horses are still smoking
In the stable and utterly done up."
The traveler glared at him and swore
loudly, to wblch, however, the host paid
not the slightest attention, being rr.Â»b
ably used to the proceeding, 'i'htn Dtm
ltri Varanzoff retired to the irner room,
where he paced up and down, pu'.ilr.s i-.i
his beard, and muttering dispiritedly t.>
himself.

he ex'.laimtd 'vith renewed fury.
Just then the host entered v. ith a di-h
of the stew; which he placed on the table,
with a large loaf of bread ami a bottle
of vodka, and the traveler hc'.nr very
sharp fet. made a hearty meal ue.-pite his
chagrin, and afterward, wrapping hJmse'-f

a second's hesitation. "May I ask you
the same question?" -> â¢
"Here I am called Petnoff; but in Oren
burg my "name was Varanzoff," said the
other laconically and sadly.
The newcomer started. "And you are
here for "
"Charged with Felling plans of Russian
fortresses to the Turks; a crime of which
I am Innocent."
"We are all Innocent," rejoined the
other, shrugging his shoulders; and then,
as the officer turned on his beat and came
toward them, they broke off their con
versation and bent steadily over their
work. From that day these two men di
came sworn friends and allies. So much
so at least as was possible under the cir
cumstances: and being members of the
same working gang they were thrown
much together.
At last Strogoff, whose less robust frame
could not so well withstand the effects of
the work and exposure, fell sick; and his
friend devoted all his spare time to wait
ing on him. The man was indeed sick al
most unto death, and was eventually loft
by the doctor to die.-. But Petnoff fed him
with the choicest morsels he could beg or
steal, and at last cheated the grim mon
arch of his prey. '.
When Strogoff once more got about he
was but a poor, attenuated mortal, and
quite unfit for work. "You have 'oeen my
good ar.scl, Petnoff," he paid, as. his friend
sat beside him one evening when the
day's work was over. "If we are ever set
free from this infernal place you shall
find that my gratitude will be boundless."
I'etnoff smiled somewhat drearily. "I
have heard men say the same things to
their comrades before, many times," he
said, "and when they say it they mean it.
But in the comfort of their own homes
they forget these dreary wastes and tht.
comrade they have left behind pining in
captivity. You will remember me for a
week, my friendâ possibly a monthâ then
I shall be forgotten."
"May heaven. then forget me," said the
other vehemently. "I have In my sickness
be^n busy making: plans for our escape."
Petnoff shook his head. "Do not think
of it," he said. "I have known men to
escape and 1 have seen them brought
back"â and he paused, shuddering. "Do
not speak again of it."
Hut a v.eeK afterward Strogcff broached
the subject once more. "I have friends in
Novgorod." he said, "If we can but get
there we are safe. My brother is an offl
or of the garrison; J am certain that
with skill, patience and secrecy we can
leave this place."

I I two sledges with their troikas of
V. I horses were swiftly traveling. The
X snow was falling in great flakes,
Iriving into the faces of the travelers,
lalf blinding them and covering them
\:;h :i thick white mantle.
â¢How much farther Is it. Ivan?" asked
a voice from the first sledge; and the
driver, lifting his white mustache and
beard from the collar of his capots, an
bwered, "Twenty vems. your Excellency,
r.o more, no less."
A grunt of disgust v/as the response, and
the speaker sank back on his seat..draw
ir.g his iurs closer around him. The sec
ond i-ieigh kept always at the same, dis
tance in the rear of the rirst; the horses
straining at the bit seemed anxious to
outstrip ihe others, but were held sternly
in check. In the sleigh two men with bent
liead? and muffled up to the chin tat

Excellency?" asked the driver, turnlnt,
round, and the man nearest him respona
Â»d in a stern voice, "No; keep them in
j^!j;ht, ami hold your horses. "
The snow descended thicker and faster.
The sledges with their occupants, their
drivers and horses, were now two moving
masses of white gliding swiftly along
over ill'- i-paikling plain.
Â¦Â£Hal! we reach the posting station be
fore nightfall?" the first traveler asked
anxiously, and the dri\er responded with
a rod; then cracked his whip at a horse
which hau stumbled, and addressing it as
"son of v pig" desired to know if their
bor.es were to be left vat on the plains.
Twilight wat falling, but the snow
threw its own light around. Suddenly the
horse* la buth sledges pricked up their
ca:t, a* from a distance borne on the
northern wind came a weird, unearthly
iiowl. The driver of the first sledge
looked buck, and his face became if pos
tibit a. shade whiter. He stood up and
lashed Ins horses, which broke into a
wilder gallop. "Wolves?" asked the trav
eler Quietly, and the driver responded,
"Wolves, your Excellency."
In tht second sleigh no words were ut
tered. L>ut the driver also whipped up his
hors-es and the troika ticw over the snow
in lur nake of the other.
The light declined slowly, and there was
still enough to see. on tne tarthttfi limit
o! the snuv.y piain icanrn mass lullowing
:n the wake of the sledges. On it came
persistently, ruthlefsiy. unswervingly,
and from it came ever and anon the
s-trange. wiid cry which haa reached Me
travelers" ears.
"They are gaining on us," said the first
traveler, aim the ativer leEponded with a
grunt.
Â¦'Cannot you go faster?" asked the trav
eler impatiently, and the driver answered:
'"No. Excellency. 1 am already driving m*
team at their utmost speed. Neverthe
less-, if your Excellency wishes."
And again he lathed the horses unmerci
fully.
Suddenly and as if by magic the second
sleigh shot ahead, end the horses appa
rently heretofore held in now went like
the wind. Mtanwh:le the dark mass in
the distance had grown larger and
darker, and. discovered to the unaccus
tomed eye skirmishers thrown out on
eithtr side as well as an advance guard
in front.
"Hurry on. hurry on." -exclaimed the
solitary traveler in an anxious voice, and
the driver replied. "Your Excellency had
better look to your rifle. You may have
to pick off some of the foremost present
ly."
Just then the horse that had already
f- tumbled fell, and the fledge came to a
dead stop. "Up. up, son of a she donkey,"
Â£<. .-tamed the driver, plying his whip vig
orously on the prostrate animal. "Do you
mean us all to be food for wolves?"
The traveler took out his rifle and a
tsar* cf pistols from under the seat and
looked carefully to the priming. "I have
here jirovender for half a dozen," he said
grimly; and the horse having struggled Io
its feet the race recom
menced. But the delay

This ch^tk had enabled thÂ»* fledge to
make way. although it was always cum

with a loud howl the wolves dashed after
it. and were evidently Kilning. Again the
rifle rang out. this time with both bar
rels, and a couple of wolves lay bleeding
on the white snow; again there was a
<h*-ck and a fight, and some of the num
ber left behind to divide the spoil.
There wre now only nbout twenty Wt

In.the last wagon, concealed under a,
covering of loose hay, arid in the near
vicinity of old disabled guns and daniagea
gunpowder,' crouched Strogoff and Petnoff.
with their Cossack deliverer, breathless
and half naked, their hearts palpitating
with anxiety and fear. The guards and
the outposts were safely passed, after
what seemed to the poor captives an eter
nity of time, and they dared at last to
raise their heads and to converse in low
tones.
"Are the soldiers safe?" asked Petnoft
fearfully,
"All bought," answered Strogoff: and
the Cossack, joining in, remarked that he
hoped there would be no mistake about
payment, as he had given his word that
the promises would be redeemed when
they reached Novgorod. Then be producei
a loaf of bread, a lump of cheese and a
bottle of vodka, and they ate ana drank
and were mightily refreshed.
The day was declining as they neared
their journey's end, and jn the distance
they could see the towers and cupolas of
Novgorod. The horses, which' had gone
all the time at a quick pace, were whipped
up and broke into a gallop, and the half
empty wagons lumbered and banged a'ontc
over mud and ruts, making the joun.ev
anything but an easy one to the occupant-;
of one of them. When they were wtih<:i
a verst of the city they heard the crack
of riiles in the distance, and looking cau
tiously from the wagon, were aware of x
body of cavalry on the verge of the hori
zon. "Our night is discovered." said the
Cossack in dismay, and they looked into
each other's face, which was blanched
with terror.
"But they are yet far off," said Stro^cf.* ;
"and if we are once inside the gates of
Novgorod, we are safe."
The Cossack spoke a few words to th<?
nearest soldier, who immediately galloped
on to the front; and presently they he-aid
the eracklsig of whips, and were mu-'e
painfully aware that the pace had o|uU.lc
cned. â¢ â¢ ,
But- the troop. .of horsemen were com

be within ritle shot: a:ul although the
wagons kept on at' their utmost speed,
their pursuers gained upon l?<e:n.
"Only half a verstâ only half a verst,"
groaned Strogoff. "Holy Saints! 'To be

garrison. It was a poor little room, mean

something covered'over with a sheet. An
officer in rich uniform stood beside It. .As
Petnoff approached he turned back the
sheet and revealed the dead face of Strog
off.
*The escaped fugitive threw himself by
the corpse of his friend and covered the
cold face and hands with tears and kisses.
"He gave his life for yours," said the
officer huskily. "He received his death
wounds in shielding you: and he only lived
an hour after he was brought In here.
"Ah! my friend: my friend!" cried Pet
noff. : Â¦
"Before he died," resumed the officer,
"he was able to converse a littlf, and I
then .learned for the first time who was
the companion of his flight, of which he
had "managed to send me word before

was his expiation."
"Expiation," ' repeated Petnoff. be
wildered.
"Carry your thoughts back nearly four
years to" a journey you made by sledge
from Orenburg to Sanator, when you were
attacked by wolves."
Petnoff nodded.
"You were passed en route by another

Fair Riders.
One of the first requisites, whether the
rider be delicate or strong, is moderation.
Riding for speed subverts the very end of
the exerciseâ it is like rowing or running
or doing anything else for speed; it final
ly, conquers the conqueror â and the most
sickening, harrowing sight is the continu
ous race. The associations of wheelmen
should do ail in their power to suppress
these public exhibitions of human idiocy.
Another essential, especially for women,
is an appropriate dress, and there is no
law against a gentleman also being ap
propriately dressed. I never could under
stand why it was necessary that a man
should wear the garb of a circus clown in
order to ride a wheel. In the past year
or two women have come nobly ;-'.;':Â«
to the rescue in the mat-
tor of genteel dress.

Other hats can be twisted and turned
v.vsi rt'.aJe to be becoming, but not so this
hat. its brim is as unhendable as a New
England c-onscienoe, and it "^tays

do credit to a leech. So the wo-

rioes not do at all '/, N*s*
and they must content "Â¦%*
themselves by spitefully
saying. Those hats are the q.
mest hideous I ever saw." m.
And that comes mighty nfar be- *J&
ir.g true. but. like some ugly peo- *~JL
pie, they have a fascination that is â¢
irresistible, and when on the right ht>ad
they are called prettyâ no, not pretty, but
""dead swell."
Wnen a woman calls another "dead
fwell" she often means that that woman
:s ugly and n~.anagcs in some clever way
to lock well in her clothes. The sarm;
with the hat. swell when on the woman
who can wear it. but uglyâ oh. so ugly,
when not.
The walking ha in the rough straw
are by far the most stylish. They vary in
shape and trimmin n . some of them being
suitable only for young girls. Soft crepe,
odd ribbon in brigh: and dark shades,
with now and then a wing or breast, are
the only trimmings used, but they are
put on in every c -eivable fashion and
have the stamp of man's work. Some are
made of cloth, with rows and rows of
stitching, and trimmed with soft silk
crepe and white wings.
The straw hats are trimmed with the
ribbon. Some of them that are like sol
dier hats have a crushed hand of the
ribbon around the crown and a laree
dnÂ»ihÂ»*> bow tacked securely to the crown
a little to the left.
One hat in this* soldier s-hape has the
bow on the left side with a quill thru=t
through the knot, but this style is not
strictly new. It being very much like the
felt hats worn during the winter.
Another broad-brimmed straw hat ha?
a round crown and no doubt will be pop
ular. It has for trimming broad ribbon.
the double bow tied at tin? front.
A very natty hat is on the Alpine order
with roiling brim and setsÂ«-^-ell over the
face. The straw is rou?h and the ribbon
trimming ties in a loose knot on the left.
A hat made of gray cloth has rows of
stitching around the brim and for trim
ming a roll of white silk and white tail
feathers: with a light gray gown it would
be very stylish. Another hat of cloth has
the stitching, but the crown Is made of
foils of the cloth and on the left side is a
brown wing, which shades into Uglier
brown and tan.
A toreador hat of fine straw has for
primming crepe de chine and a wing or
pomrons of chiffon and two long quills.
A hat that many can -wear Is a round
toque of coarse straw. The brim is cov
ered with winss. two birds forming the
trimming.
You who insisted upon wearing turbans
during the winter, beware of the straw
ones. If p.tsFible they are more unbecom
ing. Of course there are exceptionsâ faces
that c<in stand them, but :hey are far
and few between p.nd t>e sure that you are
one of them before you buy a turban.
A man s-aidâ a man who evidently knows
something: "Before the summer Is over
every woman who can will have one of
these hats and wear itâ becoming or not
becoming â wear it. with any sort of a
pown. and think herself strictly up-to
date, because ' 'tis new. is her bonnet' â
r.nd therefore must be becoming."
Just then a woman went by. Perched
jauntily on her head and touching the top
of the high collar of her sealskin jacket
was a new straw walking hat;
If a prophecy ccme true after uttered,
mid-season will find straw walking hats
and foulard gowns, silk gowns and fancy
waists In a hopeless tangle. Do remember
that walking hats are to be worn only
with cotton shirt waists and tailor gowns,
ar.d are totally out of place with
anything c'.se.
Spring fashions are
coming in so rap- **<?^i&s&.
Sonic of them sre made of very expensive
!aces. but others are of the imitation, and
:Â»re remarkably cheap and exceedingly
pretty. They arc all in one piece, wituoui
rutrtcs. and clean well.
There tire deep cape collars that are y
shape at the throat and arc something
between a bertha and a fichu in eftect.
These are remaikably cheap and make a
po'iii trimming for the summer materials,
as we!! as for dinner gowns.

the light colors are better than the dark.
It blends Itself well to the trimming of

be and is made up without any trimming
whatever excepting itself. Then there are
the chalJis. that later on will be seen in
great nthnbers, for challi is a very good
material for summer wear, and many new
designs are to be seen in it. The old
fashions that have been revived in what
were known as the Dolly Varden patterns
are good in coloring and will be much
Â¦worn during the summer. Just at present
the plain ar.d the striped enects are more
fashionable. There are also the Liberty
silks and satins in many different designs

charming silks and even velvets that

Of course the woman whe Js Inclined to

Â¦ Who-huf.a Frenchman would have con

purposes of ornament? Thesa scales hith
erto have been of little use. except to col

demand in this direction is limited, only

being sought after.- Now. owing to the

there' is likely to be a growing market
for fish scales. The Frenchman has dis

"But here we come on another fact of
even greater slgniticar.ee.
"Not only is there this total dearth in
the British army of men of experience
for the branches of the service just.men
lior.ed, but, in addition to that, It'ls a
Ftrictly accurate statempnt that no officer
in the British army has had any practi
cal experience in handling any difficult
problem of transportation in opposition to
a modern, civilized army.
"The two men who come nearest to
meeting the requirements of the situation
are Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener."
Mr. Stickney then proceeds to show
that their experience in handling any dif
'â¢.-uit ciuestion of transportation has been
very limited. He further. shows that even
In the Crimean war and the trouble in
India, white "the record of the achieve
ments or British valor has been unvaried,
there has been at the same time complete
lack cf variety in the record of the in
competence ar.d ignorance of the British
War Office." .- . i
All of which is very interesting when
compared with the incidents brought for
ward relative to the remarkable mobility
of the American armies in the Civil War
and tho manner in which they handled
problems of transportation and supply.
From a British point of view Mr.
Etickney'B book Is decidedly a wet blan
ket and contains dire prophecies of trou-
Me with India and danger from Russia, in
addition to his bold attack upon English
army methods. In fact, this point is
rather overdone in the way of constantly
lecurring remarks to the effect that:
"The first point to be noted in this con
nection in regard to the British army of
to-day is its lack of braJns," Â«
"Last and not least comes the Immense.
dense. Intense ignorance of the British
p.rmy. as an army, of the principles and
liractice of modern and scientific warfa>>..
'"They have not studied topography. It
is a matter of common report that tha
British War Office has been inadequately
t-uppliecl with maps. This is merely a sin
gle point which chows the Ignorance cn-1
incapacity of the British War Office, and
their ignorance of the fundamental con
ditions of modern warfare. Their meth
ods are still medieval."
There are Innumerable Instances of this,
until the reader forms a hazy Idea th'it
possibly Mr. Stickney has had some ex
perience with the British War Office of a.n
unpleasant nature and is venting a pet
sonal spite. Ho brings plenty of ptoof
forward to show the incompetence which
he declares exists, and his evidence Is
convincing, but his reiteration is tire
some.
The ending of the book is rather dra
matic and #ives a good Idea of the
author's partisanship.

Albert Stickmy in a very clever pro-
Beer monograph on the war has made
this one mistakeâ he endeavors to discuss
in a portion of his work the question of
who is in the ri^ht and who in the wrong.
When the reader takes up a book to help
him in the eoii^iueration of some political
.question he withes to hear the best evi
dence from both sides arid then form his
own opinionâ not to listen to a rehearsal
of one side alone and be obliged to take
the author's opinion for a conclusion. It
is hardly r.s strong as that in this case.
for the author does present some British
arguments, but not at any length, and he
omits mention of the main points claimed
by the pro-Britten to be most convincing.
In the space taken up v.ith the discussion

for Mr. EUckney to bo into a more de

a comparison between the civil war and

Mr. Stiekr.ey does not ?pÂ«re the British
Wer Off.cc. He explains its "ignorance'
and "lneompeter.ee" in the following:
"What is the reason for the ignorance
and the incompetence of the British War
Office?
"The answer to that questi-sn is some
what complex. It Is to be found in Â¦
number of facts taken in combination.
It is an old story. At Its foundation lies
the principal fact of the incapacity of
hereditary klntrs and hereditary classes
to do the severe, steady, hard work which
is absolutely essential,/ to the proper
handling of affairs of state in general and
of army officers in particular. To that
fact is to be added the further one that
e^cient army administration is an abso
lute Impossibility when it re^ts in the
hands of an ever-shiftir.g group of igncr
ant laymen, selected at uncertain' times,
for uncertain periods, from a Legislature

The author further points out the entire

The editors of the Bookman have hign
hopes for the success of their serial story
for the year 1900, beginning in the March
number. It is entitled "Strtngtown on the

writer, yet it is his first venture in fiction.
It is a thoroughly American story in spirit
and in execution. The writer, s John Url

Biography of Thomas Paine.
There has been issued by Small, May
narti & Co. another volume of the Beacon
Biographies. Thomas Paine is the' subject
cf this latest book.
The publication of a life of Paine Is par
ticularly appropriate coming at this time,
when there has arisen a renewed interest
in the meaning of the principles of the
American republic. For although Paine
reached America just before the outbreak
of the Revolution, there were few Ameri
cans who played a more important part
than he in arousing his adopted country
men to defiance Â¦ of tyranny and in
strengthening their flagging courage when
they had once entered upon the war.
Thomas Paine was born in Thetford,
England, in 1737. His father, who was
a -staymaker, took the boy at the age of
13 from school into his 'â¢hop. These few
years of schooling formed the foundation
of the education which I'aine supple
mented by private reading. The trade
Paine's father taught him he practiced
for a few years, but he did not succeed
in It, and, as it v/as hateful to him, he
gave it up. Then he tried several other
employments, in which he was equally
unsuccessful. Finally* he decided to go to
America. Paine had met In London Ben
jamin Franklin and had been given a let
ter from Franklin to his son-in-law in
Philadelphia. "
On Patne's arrival in America In 3774
Franklin's letter procured for him em
ploy/nent and opened for him the career
in America which was successful for so
many years. It was In 1775 that Paine
began this publication of the political
pamphlets which brought him so quickly
into renown and which were of such mo
ment in inspiring with hope and zeal
those who were struggling for the liberty
of the colonies. Paine threw himself heart
and soul Into the struggle for the new
cause he was championing. All through
the war and for several years after Its
termination he. lent his enthusiastic aid
to the new republic. When he felt that
his services were no longer, needed in
America he returned to England on a
visit. There his republican, sympathies
led him Into the attack upon the govern
ment of his . native land which resulted
in his publication of "The Rights; of
Man," and later upon his banishment
from England. . ; Â¦â¢
Paine next went to France and there
played almost as important a part In the
Revolution as he had in America. As a
member of the Convention he allied him
self with the Girondins, and when they

and from its careful study of the charac
ter of the ground, its Interesting points
regarding engineering and transportation
methods in vogue during our civil war,
and its statistics relative to the Boer and
English armies during . this and past
campaigns, becomes a valuable work for
present reading or for library reference
long after this trouble may have become
a thing of the past. (.The Transvaal Out-

2.M17The BcptUt Church In Fredonle. New York." Where the First Kttllnrtffht Woman's
Chrlstlcn Temperance Union Was rjdd-
"* *\HEN history shall have recor'd
\ A Jed the events of the nineteenth
\f XJ century, prominent among them
\ }f will certainly be the woman's
crusade movement which start
ed twenty-seven years ago, gaining added
vigor each year, and whos* strength will
not be spent until the goal has been
reached for which thousands of women
have worked and prayed for over a quar
ter of a century, viz.: the abolishmen 1 . of
the legalized saloon.
Probably few people fire aware that in
Fredonia, N. V., still stands the church
wherein was begun that world-famous
movement, and that the real founder of
the Woman's Christian Temperance Un
ion, Mrs. Esther Lord McNeil, is still liv
ing in that place; yet such Is the truth.
The history of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, written by Mrs. Mary
Towne Burt, for several ! years president
of the New York State division, contains
the following paragraph:- "Hillsboro,
Ohio, claims the birthplace and Docembir
j23 as the birthday of this movement.
True that from this place and day the
Influence and strength "of the movement
deepened and widened/spreading to other
localities with wonderful rapidity, but to
Fredonia, Chautauqua County, New. York,;
is accorded the honor of inaugurating the
work on December 13, 1873." ':;
The starting of this movement- was
brought about as follows: Saturday even
ing, December 13, 1873, one Dr. Dio, Lewis
of Boston delivered a Â¦ lecture on temper
ance in the Fredonia Baptist Church. To
a large and enthusiastic 'audience he out-'
lined a Â¦ course which he thought would
be successful in doing away, to a certain
extent, with the liquor, traffic In that
place. The plan was for the. women to
gather and visit the grog chops and, after,
prayers and hymns, to make an appeal
to the, proprietors to close their places.
Thus was implanted in Fredonia the seed Â¦
of temperance which grew into that;
grand and -beautiful plant, the' Woman's.
rr ' h Hstian Temperance Union, whose in- ;
fluence for. good has spread over the 'en
tire world. ;'..â¢; '-Â¦*. rXi
Dr. Lester Williams was thrn pastor of
the Baptist Church and said that he be
lieved in "striking while the iron was
hot." and asked nil of tho women who
sympathized with the movement to arise,
and In , an Instant every woman In the
house was on her fee.t. A committee Was
appointed to draw up an appeal to bo pre
sented to the saloonkeeper and a meeting
was called for the following Monday'to
decide upon an appeal nnd prepare a plan
of action. On the morning appointed
about SOO women gathered at the. church
and adopted the following appeal:
"Knowing, as we do, that the sale of tnÂ»'
toxicating liquor is the parent of all mis
ery, prolific of all woes, in this . w,orld
and the next, potent alone in evil,
blighting every fair hope, desolating fam
ilies, the chief Incentive to crime, we, the
mothers, wives and daughters,^ represent
ing tho religious and moral sentiment 'of
this town, to save the beloved members
of our households from the temptation. of
strong drink, from acquiring an appetite
for it. and to rescue, if possible, those
who have already acquired an appetite
for it, earnestly,; request that you; will
pledge yourselves to 'stop the traffic here
in these goods, 'forthwith, and forever.
We also add the; hope that you will stop
your gaming tables." V-
The women ; then formed a line of
march \ to' the ; 'i'aylor* House,' that then
stood- where now Â¦ stands the = Columbia.
These women were the wives and daugh
ters of the very best men- in'the place;
they -were venerable and -revered women
who dared to do right and for. the
â¢welfare f. of their .husbands, > son 3 and
brothers, ; e%*en, if < necessary, -to igo 'Â¦ into
the saloons arid be scoffed at and insulted.
The band; immediately. l made known i their
mission and Mrs.* Judge Barker read the
appeal \ to the 1 proprietor.. "A -. hymn 'Â¦ was
sung,Â«after;whlch: all Joined; in' repeating
the | Lord's , Prayer, j followed by a j prayer,
from Mrs. Tremalne. , Mr. ' Taylor, was
then asked to accede to their appeal, and
he finally said he would If the other li
quor dealers in the place would do so.
The work was continued for a 'week -and
one hotel and one drug store closed their
bars. ' Thus was started the" movement
known as the crusade- that swept around
the. world,. carrying its mission of happi
ness to 'thousands of homes. â¢
\On- Monday, December 21, 1573, the women
met to perfect fi permanent organization.
This they named the Woman's Chr'ctlan
Temperance 'Union of : "Fredonia. The
pledge adopted at the meeting was: "We,,
the undersigned women of Fredonia, feel
ing that; God has laid. upon us a work for
temperance," do hereby pledge ourselvrs to
united land j continous j efforts Â¦to suvipre^
the trafficking .cf j Intoxicating liquors in
our village until/ the- work Is accom
plished;'and that we stand- ready for.
united effort 3 upon' any. renewal of the
traffic. We .will also do all in our power
to : alleviate the sufferings of . drunkards'
: families and to rescue ; from drunkenness
all : who 'are pursuing/ Its ways." Soon
after this unions \ were ! formed in ; various
places throughout the State, and the work
"assumed "\ far Â¦ '. greater than '
everi'the most sanguine had thought pos
sible, and it was decided to hold a meeting
for the "organization of a State union. Thi3 '
Â¦meeting was held in Syracuse,' October 10,
1874. The- work . steadily ; advanced,' not .
only !in this ? State, but; spread -through
every State In/ the United States, an i
finally a national union ! was formed, nn<l
later an" International Woman's Christian
Temperance Union. Â¦' . . :
? Most; prominent among the workers In
this first crusade was:' Mrs. Esther Lord
McNeil, who Is known throughout the en
tire country as "The Veteran Crusader,"
Mrs. McNeil was born in Carlisle, Schoha
rie County.- New York, in 1812,- and at tha
age of 10 years she was left fatherless lum
family of ten children. At 20 she was mar
ried to J ames McNeil ; and moved to Fre-~

have set people to questioning as to
Â£ whether the climate of California
nay not be undergoing a change.
lian) think that they have detected a
slowly growing aridity in different parts
of the State iir.rt tear that parts of Cali
fornia now fertile are do.-tine<l ta become
deserts. In all probability such fears are
groundless. The weather bureau reports
havfi been kept too few years yet for us
to draw any safe conclusions from them.
I: is. however, undoubtedly true, from the
ptundfi'iint of the geologist, who is ac
customed to view with complacency !onir
stretches of time, that the climate o-f
California is really changing. It has al-
been chancing and always will con
tinue to d-j so. but whatever this change,
whether toward a more moist condition
or a drier one. it is certain that it is co
s=l<rtv that none of us can detect the
or-arisre in a lifetime or even in a dozen
liietimes.
We need net fear that our rivers will
iti the course of each succeeding: year
carry noticeably more or less than the
average amount of water. But we do
r:eed fczr and should take great care to
prevent the grassed and forested areas
be:np so disturbed that the water of win
ter will quickly run off and leave the
pround dry and parched the remainder of
the year.
The climate of this State, geologically
speaking:, has recently been very different
from what it is? now. During the placial
period, which perhaps was not more than
â¢ 10JOM years ap,o, the precipitation upon
the Sierra Nevada Mountains v;asÂ» very
niuch greater thÂ»n It is now, and the
nu-itins: snow and ice of the glaciers pup
s>li*-<i a vast amount of water for the
prcat lakes, which filled the large valleys
of Nevada and portions of Eastern Cali
fornia. So numerous and c-xtensive were
th<".Â«e lakes that v."c would not have recog
nized the country. The former size anil
level of these lakes Is Indicated by ter
races Ftretchir.g around th<* ' borders of
many of the deserts. At the time of which
Â¦we are speaking the marshes from wnich
our salt and borax come were lakes.
I have recently examine;! some very In
teresting things of this kind in Inyo
County: that region of strange contrasts;
of scorching deserts and moun
tains. Owens Lake, at the lower end of
the long valley of the wme name, is a
large body of water, perhaps eighteen
miles long. Though receiving the" waters

above the present lake. We trace this for
miles In and out around the ' hills " and
mountains, till at last we find that'thls
old beach corresponds to the upper end
of the old river bed. For thousands of
years, perhaps, the la>:e was high, and the
river flowed south and tumbled its waters
into the Salt Wells Desert. There It col
lected and finally overflowed Into what is
now the borax marsh in San Bernardino
County. ' Then another lake was formed,
and lasted for a long time, as the,beauti
ful terraces along the Slate and Argus
ranges show us.
Go where we will through California, we
find traces of a once heavier rainfall or
snowfall. The country . v-p.s moist and
lakes were everywhere. Old river beds,
no.v dry. are to be found in many places,
and jntrlfied trees where now there are
no forests. â¢ -'>'4- ;^^
/California was then very much more,
moist, but that parts of it are so dry now"
docs not prove that it is still becoming
'dryer. Our climate depends largely, upon
the Pacific Ocean and the height and po
sition of the. mountain rangrs. . The posi
tions of mountain ranges vary, with time.
If they are lifted. higher, more rain and
snow will fall upon them, and if they are
lowered, less will fall. Which of.these two'
processes Is in the ascendant In the Sierra
No.vadas at present we do not know. ThÂ«
geologist and the meteorologist will have
to work together for many years to de
termine this momentous question. In the
meantime we may go on as usual planting
our crops, feeling sure that though it may
rain a little less one year, it will make up

Abraham Lincoln's Private Car.
PETITIONS are in circulation among
prominent colored people of Omaha
asking the City Council to make an
effort to secure as the permanent
properly of the city the famous old Lin
coln car. now slowly falling to pieces on
n siding down at the Union Pacific shop*.
They feel that any relic so closely associ
ated with thfe great emancipator should
be better treasured, by the community,
lest it go into decay entirely or pass into
other hands and be taken from the city.
Overtures have been received in times
past by the Union Pacific from private
parties, but always dfclined. It la be
lieved that the road will feel differently,
however, were it approached by repre
sentatives of the city.
This old car was built at the United
States military car shops in lS&t especially
for President Lincoln on plans approved
by him. It was peculiarly constructed, in
that heavy armor plate that would resist
the heaviest rifle bullet was set between
the inner and outer walls, so that the
President could with safety go to. the
front. The car was thus used on several
trips to visit the army of the Potomac.
Although it was a monster then, it looks
like a pygmy by the side of the modern
Pullmans. It is 42 feet long and S^i feet
wide, and is divided into three compart
ments. There is but one entrance, that
leading into a narrow hallway -the entire
length of the car. The interior of the car
was richly upholstered in crimson silk
and furnished with easy-chairs and a big
sofa that could to unfolded and was used
as a bed by Mr. Lincoln. The larger of
the three apartments was used by him as
an office and reception room.*
Then, again, the car was used on a most
memorable tripâ that which conveyed the
remains of the martyred President from
Washington to Springfield. 111., for burial
âa trip that included every State capital
on the way and many large cities, lasting
from April 21 to May 3, 1865.
After the . war, when the Government
was selling unserviceable property, the
car went at auction and was bought by
Sidney Dillon, then president of the Union
Pacific, and General Durant and brought
to Omaha. For several years It was used
as a Union Pacific directors' car. but on
account of Its heavy armor its grea.l
weight was an objection.
So the old car was retired to the "Lin
coln shed" in the yards, to remain till
;iKuin called to public notice by the Trans^
Mississippi Exposition, where it was
placed in view and visited by hundreds of
thousands of people. Then it went back
to the shop yards, to disappear In decay
unless the colored p*Â»ople or some other
enterprise rescues It In time.

False Teeth of Antiquity.
Tho manufacture and use of false teeth
Is undoubtedly a pract.'ce of great an
tiquity. The ancient Egyptians were no
mean df-ntl.-us. Jawbones of mummies
have been found with false teeth in them,
and also with teeth filled with gold. The
ancient Greeks also knew how to fill
teeth with gold and how to make falsa
teeth.
There Is plentiful evidence of skilled
dentistry among the Remans, for many
of the old Latin authors have reference*
to false teeth. In the "Roman Laws of,
the Twelve Tables" there are distfnet ref
erences to artificial teeth. - The first part
of No. 10 forbids useless expense at funer
als in general, but an exception is permit
ted by No. 11, which allows that the gold
fillings of false teeth or the gold with
which they were bound should ba burled
or burned with the deceased.

From the homes on our hilltops and our

other things sacred to the teachings <:f

Mystery of Dreams Revealed.

timÂ«. There was no discernible order to
the cortege as it passed along the hot
rond f<;r six miles, group after group go

Tho Indian burial ground is a mound
in the lov.er end of the valley, called Lit

Colorado River. It covers scarcely an

the valley, with a background of sandy

it in line and shook hands with the dead
medicine man. Some gave the cold hand
a hearty grip, but the touch of others was
noticeably gingerly. Then the hand was
covered again, and a young fellow, dress

crbockeis that a Pullman tou.-lst passing
through the Needles had given him some
years ago. and shod in worn-out Indian

the coffln with their knuckles, passing
their hands up and down over it. howling
and moaning all the time. Then some
forty old and wrinkled bucks came for
ward with handfuls of dust. and. sur
rounding the- rude coffin, threw the dust
over themselves, at the same time pros
trating themselves on the ground. Their
cries were piercing shrieks, so much so -
that the host of little, Indian children on
the outskirts of the. mournful throng put
their hands to their ears because of child

The grave was lined with new rush

much difficulty and many experiments,

grew louder, and always the voices of the .

One evening recently there came the

He was about 60 years old. and he had

end back again the next morning. Early
next day the rop.ds were dotted with
groups wending their way as rapidly as
possible toward the camp of the big
Spring, the home of the deceased. Sonv;
r->de on buckboards. or rattling spring
Â¦wagons, e'rawn by measly dwarfed horses,
and followed in every case by one or more
mangy dogs. Women and children
crouched In the bottom of the wagons,
and some of them were uttering the fu
neral wail, with heads hung down on their
breasts. Others were striding along bare
footed through the middle of the dusty
road. Sometimes the buck rode horseback,
while his squaw and children fo.iowed him
on foot carrying the family dinner In a
greasy, dirty bag or a torn, decrepit knap
sack that had once done service In the
army.
The Hualipi tribe, growing lazier each
year, long ago discarded all signs of dis
tinctive Indian costume, and now dress Â«n
the cast-off clothing of white people or in
some imitations as the skill of the squiw i
can accomplish. On this funeral occasion
the wome-n were attired in the eddest com
bination of suits, gathered from the dona
tions cf the various kindly disposed fam
ilies in the Southern California, towns and
from overland tourists on the cars to and
from the Pacific Coast. A light calico
skirt, trailing Its ruffles in tne dust at
every step, a waist cf bright plaid gW
haml patched with unbleached muslin an-l
ornamented with brass pantaloon buttons.
and a headgear or red and white cotton
handkerchiefs, made up the costume o:
the favorite daughter of the deceased.
"Old Boaxum's" squaw, who Is distin
guished as the owner of what was once a
sewing machine and some paper patterns,
wore a tea gown of cheesecloth, trimru'r''
d'.wn the front with curtain lace and ruf
fled up the waist in the back. On her bactc
she carried a papoefse, and by her side
trudged her ten-year-old son, whose
"par.ts" and coat had previously been the
much-worn property of an Italian miner,
anu had been cut -*r as to the legs and
sleeves. He was barefooted and barehead
ed, but he wore a vest constructed o*
white flour sacks bearing the words
"XXa Flour" and "So-and-Sos Mills."
and something in tin intended to imitate
a watch chain. Another old and wrinkled
buck in the tribe strode solemnly along
the hot, sunbaked adobe road, arrayed
only in a discarded military cap and a
duster that was kept together by several
ropes tied about the waist.
The most primitive looking member of
the tribe was an old. fierce looking squaw,
whose exciting behavior conveyed the im
pression that she was chief mourner. She
had on a short blue skirt that scarcely
reached her knees and a blouse waist
girded by a leather belt. She carried a
tall walking stick, and her head was cov
ered only by her shock of black unkempt
hair, which was cut off square at her
shoulders. Her gesticulations and loud,
pafcEionate talk made her suggestive of
the "wild Indian." Just ahead of her her
husband was carrying a papoose â a most
unusual state of affairs.
Some distance behind, out of reach of
her voice, came a group of young girls,
laughing and kicking up clouds of dust
with their chubby feet as they went, each
laden with a bag of provisions slung over
her shoulder. One, however, carried no
bag and kicked no ddst. for she had St.
Vitus' dance and could scarcely keep pace
with the others. We recognized several
small children as belonging to a "campoo
die" in Snake Valley, twelve miles away,

A great deal of activity Is belnjr shown
in India to build Irrigation works and
thus . protect it against * famine - from
drought. Â¦By means "of irrigation it is
hoped to turn barren lands to fruitful
fields. But It takes time and a vast
amount of money Â»â¢Â» accomplish this.
The famine specter that for centuries
has stalked through India will be crippled
by modern methods, but It will be years, if
ever, before it is entirely laid. law.
*% "X OT many weeks ago 1 came upon
I \l a lmn<i of children merry making
IV in a leafy canyon of the Berkeley
I V foothills. They were happy,
\Â» healthy youngsters. as rosy
cheeked and lusty lunged as any
that ever romped up hill and down dale.
Tired of this nook, they made for the
next green knoll, leaving the remnants of
their pjcr.ic luncheon behind them.
I watched them scampering off so full
of life and health. I looked at the partly
filled boxes and bags left behindâ a dozen
or more sandwiches, a hard-boiled egsr,
bits of cake an.l scraps of the odds and
ends mot her 5 tuck into the picnic basket.
Then somehow my mind went back to a
scene in India that I witnessed Just be
fore I left that country. I was passing
through one of the famine-stricken dis
tricts with several other people. By the
roadside cuddled a heap that on nearer
view proved to be several children. They
Â¦were lying almost naked, too weak to sit
t;p. their hungry-looking bones showing
pitifully, their faces drawn and gaunt.
We save them a luncheon which we
Â¦were carrying for ourselves. At the most
they had expected a coin or a bit of bread.
To them our simple fare was a repast fit
for the gods and as unexpected as though
it had fallen from heaven itself. They de
voured it greedily, even searching the
ground for a stray crumb. We ourselves
went without food until the next stopping
place, when we satisfied our hunger, but
never have we been able to erase the pic
ture of those emaciated hunger-mad chil
dren. Whenever I see children cramming
their little "tummies" full and gayly leav
ing the rest to the birds, I think of tho?e
hungry miles in India, who are grateful
for a morsel.
Why should India be subject to such Cre
quent famine?? Is nothing done to miti
pate them? -These ouestioni* are con
stantly asked by the uninformed.
There are many causes of the Indian
famines. Vnder former native govern
ments famines were regarded as visita
tions from the pods, and therefore beyond
the power pC man. So the officials did
nothing to prevent or lessen the ravages
of famine. "There-i.-- no remedy but the
mercy of God," the officials. Famine
gathered itÂ« frightful tieatii harvest un
checked. People left to die did not com
plain against the officials, for, being fatal
ists themselves, they believed that human
efforts were powerless against the anger
of the gods.
ThÂ« first great Indian famine of which
there is any authentic record is the. fam
ine of l~<). Prior to that year the stories
of natives and casual references In native
chronfcles are the only sources" of " in
formation. In 1770 tbe records say that
owir.g to a sudden failure of the periodic
rains "the fields of rice became like fields
of dried straw." The stock of seed
grain was equally devoured, and when
this was exhausted, leaves, grass and
linally the dead supplied sustenance for
the livir.g. Official accounts further state
that this famine resulted in the death of
more than a third of the population.
The recurrence of famines in Southern
Ir.dia. at intervals of about eleven years
has suggested the ingenious theory that
this periodicity accorded with the period
of sun spot variation. Though ingenious.
The theory is not credited by scientists.
A report of an expert says that famines
In India have arisen from several differ
ent causes, but the most general cause
has not been failure of the usual rains.
Storms and flood?, swarms of rats and
locusts, and the immigration of the starv
ing people from distant distressed parts
ir.xo districts otherwise well provided
Â¦wfth food supplies ar<? some of the causes
enumerated br this scientist. - i
If I were asked to give what I consider
the chief cause of the famine I should
promptly Kay â fatalism. Fatalism teaches
Them to believe that whatever Is must be.
a.r.!i they accept plague or famine without
stirring hand or foot to stay its progress.
Their sufferings are beyond imagination,
but death holds no fear for them, so they
offer no resistance to the scourges that
plow through their ranks and carry off
friends and relatives.
This indifference, founded on fatalism,
runs through all classes. The Rajah or
. Nawab !r. a famine-stricken district will
pper.d a fortune fcr his personal and
Eelf.fh gratiflcatlcr:. while around him his
for lack of. nourishment. The Rajah's
creed 'teaches him that the gods have sent
the. famine, so why should he open .his
coffers to allay It? Nor do the people 'ex
pect it. No hungry mob stones a prince's
palace. They take the good days and the
bad day? a<j evidence of the pleasure pr
wrath of the gods.
An English lady, a physician, was rnllod
to the palace of a Prince who ruled ov-. r
a famine-stricken district. She saved the
life of one of the newly acquired women
in his hairm. of whom he had not yet had
time to grow tired. He begged her to L*
allowed to show his gratitude, and to htj
surprise the lady asked that he (five a
public dinner to the people in the imme
diate neighborhood, numbering several
hundred souls.
The Indian Prince could not understr.nl
such a request; but hÂ» acceded to It. after
ward, however, sending her the mary val
uable n:jr.Â» and hangings which had d*?c>
rau-d the apartment in the pa!ace givtn
over to her use.
Through Jier pleading this Indian P r 'r.re
was finally made to partly, see that human
intervention Is possible In a famine visita
tion. She Induced him to put Fuch a strict
watch over the native overseers that they
"could not pursue the dishonest methods
in that district by which they flaurlMi on
others. The native overseers are given i
certain* amount of grain to pay the pce.r
who labor In the fields. The pittance of
grain is measured out at the close of trie
day, and the wily overseer adulterates it
with sand, bo that the people only get a
fraction of their dii*. In famine tlnsvs
grain Is almost worth It* weight in golJ,
mitigate famine suffering, and also the
outside world has put it? hand deep into
its pocket for this stricken nation. Mis
takes have been made, but they were not
through carelessness, but rather ignor
ance and lack of co-operation of the na
tive dignitaries. To reduce to order and
method a gigantic organization for the
distribution of relief has' been a herculean
task. " . . , .
The the humanitarian work
is shown by comparing the d^ath rate
during the' recent famines with that of
JS7S-7*. Although the area and population
affected in the earlier famine were some
what smaller than In tin* recent one, the
death rate was much greater.
It is often said that foreigners li\-insr in
India soon become . thoroughly unsym
pathetic and hardened to suffering. .It is
true that we become hardened to sights
of suffering, for suffering in all Its forms
is ever before our eyes. But it. is not
true that the majority are unsympathetic.
A. calm exterior often hides an aching
heart, but where there are so many calls
on sympathy one must husband It and
give it judiciously.. I saw In a recent In
terview with Mrs. Harriet Tytler. who Is
now In New York -trying to ral.se funds
for an orphange in Tncin. the following
example N of selfishness. I quote'- Mrs.
Tytler exactly as she is quoted in the New

son, and daughter. They were emaciated
beyond description and seemed too weak

All of < the nobility not in the

It is impossible to estimate the amount
of wealth which is scattered through the
different rcgiment3 of the British army
as represented by that part of the nobility
which has gone to war. It is stated by
some that it Is far greater than the wealth
of the South African mines all told. A3

tached to the Cheshire Yeomanry, is now
Â¦with Sir Alfred Milner's staff, and those
who know say that he will have to pay

Rev. Mr. Bean has. several times been
taken to task by committees and ministers
of ihe gospel, who have endeavored to
whow him that he' is committing a eacri

..Naturally Rev. Mr. Bean and his pecu

comment, and he has often been called
upon for an explanation of his philosophy.
In an article which he wrote for the cur
rent Xational Review he sums up his idea
in the. following words: '.-..'/-,
"When the body, was intrusted to my
care it was" perfect in its organism. I am
supposed to keep it free from, all contam

A few of them are heated by hot water,
but the majority use warm air. supplied
by the heat from a kerosene lamp, and to

kept up day and night, and the only time

during the short time they are set out on
a table every day to allow the necessary

Every Sunday a new brood is added, to

Once a Week in Peace or War Comes the British
Soldiers' Pay Day.
Gentler weapons than ball and bayonet are now to be used In the concilia
tion of the people of the Orange Free State. The 60,000 soldiers with whom
Lord Roberta fought his way to their capital are to be armed with an agent
whose power the British Government well know and appreciateâ gold. The
British commissaries are to pay cash for everything had from the burghers,
as also are the soldiers, under heavy penalties. Once a week, at home or
abroad, "Tommy Atkins" gets his moneyâ averaging say J3 80 per week for
the non-commissioned officers and soldiersâ a sum whose expenditure will go
far toward reconciling the burghers to the presence of their conquerors.
LQXDON, March 18.â The
force under General Pole-
Carew which was sent by
Lord Roberts to join hands with
Gatacre and Clements has ac
complished its mission, having
reached Xorvals Pont. General
Gatacre is reported to be as far
north as Springfontein. This
was the chief item of war news
yesterday and added to the re
joicing here in honor of St. Pat
rick's day. It is evident that the
resistance of the Free Staters
south of Bloemfontein has com
pletely collapsed. Even to the
northward the Boers are showing
little apparent activity. The
bridge across the Modder River
has been found untouched.
It is thought probable that
within a week Lord Roberts will
be able to commence the march
northward to carry the .British
flag into Pretoria. When any,
military man is asked how long
he thinks it will take to capture
the Transvaal capital he will
venture no opinion except that
even' day is bringing the Boer
downfall nearer. Although the
correspondents are not permitted
to wire any details as to the
movements of troops it is clear
enough from the hints let drop in
more than one message that im
portant steps are in progress.
News is expected soon that the
little towns of Ladys Brand and
Wepener, close to the Basuto
land border, have been occupied
by the British mounted troops
and that, the whole country, be
tween them and Bloemfontein is
being closely watched by patrols.
In this manner the march north
ward of any organized body of
Boers will' be effectually pre
vented.
It is also counted on with con
fidence here that the guns arid

While a lenient and conciliatory policy has been inaugurated by Lord. Roberts'toward 4 the people of the Orange Free
State, those of Cape Colony who have taken up arms will -be dealt with 'as rebels against .their Queen." Already as fast
as the British troops have reoccupted the disaffected districts of Cape Colony' those ;- susjpfeted '-, of - rebellious acts or
sympathies have been arrested and senV to Cape . Town - for confinement and - trial at a later day. . ? . . . ..
The first beset and the last relieved will be. the story of the siege of Ma
feklng: if the long-expected and yet delayed succor reaches the little band of
defenders before their last ration Is gone and their last shot has been tired.

'LONDON. March 17.â The mouths of
the panic-mongers have been stopped and
by a Frenchman. It Is a curious commen
tary upon a certain side of the British
character, which has lately been much
In evidence. Several papers of fair
standing have seriously been putting for
ward the probability of war with France
and their sensations have been gulped
down eagerly by a small section of the
British public though well-Informed peo
ple are only amused. France, however,
was not the only nation which, it is
asserted, meditated an immediate in
vasion of England. Russia, Germany
and Austria, according to the manufac
turers of panics, had designs to take
advantage of Great Britain's troubles in
South Africa. With the cries for home
defense in ascendent, Great Britain might
have duplicated the Bcenes when the isl
and awaited the prospective invasion of
Napoleon. But M. Delcasse, the French
Foreign Minister, spoke, and the bogle of
European hostility and Interference van
ished.
The hand of the Frenchman restored
calm to Great Britain. Without, the bias
of friendship, he disclosed, the "common
sense with which France and the other
European powers were . [ governing their
relations toward Great Britain, and bore
home what has frequently been set forth
in these dispatcnesâ i. c., that no power
had the slightest intention of going to war
with Great Britain at present and Ino
power was anxious to intervene in be
nalf of the Boers.
Trouble in Balkans.
The pacinc condition which European
matters assume is far more likely to be
disturbed by trouble in the Balkans than
by the South African war or anything in
which Great Britain is chiefly concerned,
tnough the Balkan difficulty is most un
likely to result in a Continental war. This
latest trouble consists in the apparent de
termination of Prince Ferdinand to de
clare himself King of Bulgaria and re
nounce Turkey's suzerainty. He would
scarcely contemplate this without the
backing of Russia, whence come Prince
Ferdinand's generals, guns, and this
week, his national loan. As the Spectator
points out, for the Sultan to refuse abso
lutely the request of. Prince Ferdinand,
supported by Russia and not negatived
by the triple alliance, would be a very
serious event indeed, "and it may occur
sooner than we, who are all looking
southward instead of eastward, are ready
to suppose."
However, there Is no reason to suppose
it will not blow over, as did the friction
between Great Britain and Germany over
the seizure of the latter's ships in South
African waters. To what extent . that
friction went was only known this week,
when a blue book giving the correspond
ence.of the Governments concerned was
published. The tart demands of the' Ger
man Embassador and Lord Salisbury's as
tonished comments at being thus ad
dressed by a nation whom Mr. Chamber
lain but a few weeks previous had lov->
ingly included in the so-called "new drel
bund" came as a revelation. Had not the
matter been completely settled, thanks to
Lord Salisbury' giving way, and had not
GrÂ«at Britain been so completely en
grossed by the progress of her, arms in
South Africa, it would have raised a
storm of indignation against Germany
fifty times greater than did Emperor Wil
liam's celebrated cable message to Presi
dent Kruger after the Jameson raid. The
correspondence Itself shows no evidence
of reconciliation, but it is learned that this
has been effected and also that rather
curious conditions attended the negotia
tions. . Â¦ . -V. .
Germany's Double Play.
Whenever the German Ambassador saw
Lord Salisbury "butter wculd not melt in
his mouth," and his words were honeyed,
vet when Count yon Bulow, the German
Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke pub
licly he was anti-British, and when the
dispatches which would in the nature of
things be published were written by the
German side they were formulated in the
same strain. To quote a British Foreign
Office official, "Germany flaunted us in
the face of the world and- curried favor
privately."
The will -of Isaac Gordon, the notorious
money lender, who died recently, cannot
be found and is being advertised for. It
appears this well known name in the
English courts, .though Gordon himself
rarely appeared, was borne by a man of
only 33, who is credited with leaving
$5 .000 .000. On his body was found $20,000
and in his office {133,000 in cash. This ac
cumulation was due to the fact that the
bank? finally would not have anything to
do with his accounts. - â¢

said a responsible official to a representa

what was the feeling of the French Gov
ernment regarding - President McKinley' s
offer, of his good offices to England. .
Â¦ "We felt," continued the official in ques
tion* "that our own;positlon with respect
to England, in view of the present state
of public feeling there, was too delicate
to admit of ever acceding to Mr. Kruger's
appeal, and as this reluctance appeared
to be shared by every other power the ac
tion of the American Government In tak
ing the initiative came as ' an agreeable
surprise. That it did not succeed does
not detract from Its merit." ;
The Associated Press .representative
here called the Interlocutor's attention to
'the complaints of a portion of the French
press that President McKinley refrained
from backing up his offer, which was
necessary to its success, some papers hav
ing openly stated that his action was a
mere electoral maneuver and not intended
to be successful.'
Â¦ "In our view," replied the official,
"these criticisms are utterly unjustified.
President McKinley did -even more than
up to the last moment was expected over
here. Only .the members of chancellories,
who realize the delicate nature of such a
step, \ can appreciate j America's Â¦ effort -at
its proper value. The French Government,

mines, as predicted by Montagu White, is
regarded as a serious matter here and is
not merely possible, but probable. The
French Government has received infor
mation to the same effect from another
source, " and It considers the descendants
of : the Dutchmen who flooded their own
country in order to repel an Invader quite
capable of following this historic preoe
dent in the case of foreign-owned gold
mines. The French press has taken up
the matter and points out the enormous
amount j of French savings sunk In - the
Rand goldflelda. It Is stated that If the

YOKOHAMA. Feb. 28 (via steamship
Idrui XLa.ru at Victoria, B. C, ilarch 17).â
The persistency with which the Western
press clings to the imminence of war be
tween Russia and Japan is attracting
n.uch attention, where thus far there has
â¢â¢eemed to be no foundation whatsoever
for the rumor. The fact which now im
presses the public is the arrival of repre-
Fentatives of some of the prominent New
York papers, they having been sent for
the express purpose of being upon the
rpot when the outbreak comes. This, to
cetber with the activity prevailing in the
Russian squadron in eastern waters as
sembling in force as It Is In the Korean
Straits and the reports constantly coming
in of extraordinary doings at Port Ar
thur, has at last forced the conviction
that where there is co much smoke there
must be some fire, and the people and
i'ress are correspondingly on the gui vive.
In official circles, however, the utmost
caJm is manifest, while everybody else is
wondering what it all means. In the
meantime one of the Chinese papers act
ually propounds the theory that Japan
will be likely to take the opportunity fur
nished by the approaching naval ma
neuvers in the Korean Straits to strike a
Middon blow at Russia.
The question as to land titles held by
foreigners here under the old treaties has
nX last been settled by an authoritative
communication from the Foreign Office to
;he French Minister, which is entirely
satisfactory to the holders, and therefore
one. of the chief causes of friction under
the new order of things has been re
in oved.
Yokohama has been visited by another
prrcat fire, sweeping away some 300 houses
in the native town. Comparatively little
destitution has been caused by it, as
the Japanese are now largely availing
Themselves of the resource of insurance

In addition to numerous objects destlneJ

In the work of the exhibition, in the
French as well as the American section,
but as no one will be ready on April 15.
whatever the Government may say. the
time lost by the non-arrival of the chip
probably will Â»oon be regained.
The exhibition probably will not be com
pleted until May 15. From that date it

LONDON, March 17.â Shamrock ,day
promises to vie with Primrose day. Judg
ing by the enthusiasm with which, for
the first time in the history of the nation,
loyalists all over the United Kingdom
celebrated, while everywhere the "green"
was conspicuous. From Windsor Castle,
where the Queen observed the day by
wearing a sprig of genuine four-leaved
shamrock, to the East' End of the* slums
of London, where the ragged urchin glo
ries in his morsel of green weed, nearly
every one sported something in the shape
of a green favor. A word from her Ma
jesty has turned the emblem of semi-dis
loyalty Into a badge of honor and has
made the shamrock the most prized of all
plants in the British Isles. â¢
By the Queen's order the bells in the
curfew tower of Windsor Castle honored
St. Patrick thiÃ morning, Lrish airs played
by the Grenadiers enlivened the Queen's
luncheon, and on London's Mansion House
floated a new royal Irish flag, with the
Union Jack in the upper corner, and a
crowned harp in the center of a green

which bears the harp without the Union
or Crown. The. street venders dio.
a roaring business with flags, moss spin
ach, bits of green ribbon, etc. Houses
and stores lavishly displayed green flags
and bunting, and Irish soldiers . and sail
ors showed special pride in wearing the
national emblem.- The supply of genuine
shamrock was so scarce that half a dozen
leaves sold readily for half a crown.
The ancient ceremony of "trooping the
colors at Dublin castle" was especially
picturesque. -It was: performed to-day in
the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, Earl Cadogan; the Duke of Con
naught, commander in chief of the forces
In Ireland, and a brilliant assemblage. All
the troops wore the shamrock. ';Â¦; Â¦ Â¦
The second <~Â»y s sale of the Irish In
dustries Association was opened at .tne
London Mansion House this afternoon by
the ; Lady Mayoress, with princesses,
duchesses, countesses and commoners
attending the stalls, which conducted 'the
bisgest kind of a trade.-
Most of the Government officials hoisted
the Irish flag and the clubs w*re sim
ilarly decorated, the officials all wearing
Wie green.
In the churches the preachers referred
to the occasion, thanking Providence that
the English had learned to love and re
spect their Irish fellow subjects as they
never knew them or respected them be
- The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Russell of
Killowen, set the example in the law
courts and all the Judges followed his
example of wearing the shamrock below
their ermine collars.
On the Stock Exchange the enthusiasm
shown in celebrating the day gave the
room the appearance of a green house.
The shamrock was everywhere and there
was more toasting of health than work.
As a result prices were better, though no
body knows why. - â¢ , "
The scenes at Aldershot were character
istic of the celebration of St. Patrick's
day and in all the other garrison towns
, the- shamrock was -onned by .all Â«the
troops privileged to wear it. At reveille
the Irish bands made a tour of the. bar
racks playing "Garry Owen," "St. Pat
rick's Day in the Morning" and "The
Boys of Wexford." In front of the offi
cers' mess they played the national.an
! them and cheered the Queen. *."-,
It is understood the Queen, having ap
proved the proposed formation of a regi-'
ment of Irish Guards, will make the an
nouncement on the subject to-day."
St. Patrick's Church, London,, was
densely packed when Bishop Brindle, D.
1 8.1 0. (Distinguished Service Order), late
chaplain of the British = forces in South
Africa; officiated at a pontifical high mass
in the presence of Cardinal Vaugnan. All
the clergy and the congregation wore the
shamrock, and the scene, as the Cardinal
in his red* and white robes slowly moved
up the central aisle blessing the congre
gation was very impressive. It was ex
pected that the Cardinal would deliver the
St. Patrick's day address, but : this de
volved on Father Aidan, who remarked
that both friend and foe were unstintedly
"praising the Irish bravery, heroism and
generalship lust .now 'Â¦ so conspicuous on
the battlefield." and- added that the
"wearing of the shamrock, emblem of

against female employes. This { evidence
was drawn from published reports about
the results of an Investigation made by a

When the opposition toward the most
illiberal paragraphs of the bill found that
the majority, consisting of Conservatives,
Centerists and Nationalists, meant to
squelch the speeches and argumentations
against this condition an obstruction pol
icy was adopted, under the leadership of
Herren Richter and Singer, the intention
apparently being to wear out the majority
âparticularly y the Centerâ and render .it
ready, for a compromise. This obstruction'
policy. whichVwas skillfully carried -out
during the latter half of the week, being
a novel feature in German parliamentary
life, caused-the greatest sensation and- the

speaking of it as a "parliamentary breach
of the constitution" because of, a certain

Nobody seems! able to tell precisely for'
how long or why, although different state

International politics have been, rather
quiet this week. The South African .war
was not followed with the " close 'atten

of embroiling Great- Britain and Germany.

morning of the thirty-seventh day, having
eaten six of his dogs and suffered

Attacked by ' Natives.
That night La Joie was awakened by
the barking of Jiis dogs. He jumped to
his feet and found that he was surrounded
by a tribe of copper-colored natives/who
were shooting at him with bows and ar
rows. La Joie was armed ; only ; with, a
knife and club, but his double suit of skin
protected him from the arrows/
The next day they were willing- to treat
for peace. La Joie held two wounded-na
tives as hostages, and the fact, that; hÂ«)
treated them kindly allowed him to put
himself, through a little diplomacy, on
good terms with the remainder of the
party, which consisted of about forty-five.
He describes the men whom he Joined as
belonging to a strange race, speaking Â¦ a
tongue entirely unlike that of the, other
natives whom he had met on' his. travels.
Their complexion, he states, was of a red
dish brown hue and their eyes and- hair
were either black or brown. The men
were very large, averaging more than ' 6
feet in height. Their clothes were made
of skins and shaped after a strange
fashion.
They took him to their camp, in which
was' a big tent framed of whalebones and
covered with whale skin. He remained In
the camp five months and learned a few
words of their language. .
"I lived two years among the natives,"
says La Joie. "and learned In that time
their langaupe and how to read their
hieroglyphics. I then determined to re
turn to civilization. I ordered the people
to build me a boat. This was constructed
of whaleskin. It was thirty feet long, five
wide and four deep. ' i .
"I set upon the return Journey with two
of the natives. To go over and detail my
hardships during the subsequent period
of five months would be merely to repeat
in lesser degree the sufferings of the trip
to the island. The gTeat change of; cli

two faithful fellows who were with -me
that both died before I reached the main
land. .
"I reached Nekalek, Alaska, in the fall

He was raised to the life of a hunter and

ships and exposures of northern winters,
he yet inherited the warm blood and love
of adventure which pertain to people of
Latin descent. was bred to maintain
existence undeflconditions which can be
endured as a rule only by the Eskimo.
In December, 18S6, according to his nar
rative. La Joie and his father started
from Montreal for Battleford, Northweft
Territory. Leaving his father in Southern
Canada, La Joie started on a hunting and
trading expedition out into the far north
west. After three years' hunting throur-jh
British Columbia and Alaska he arrivo>l
at Great Bear Lake in the fall of ISS?.
Game having grown scarce, he determined
to push further north with a partner, "a

Adrift on an Iceberg.
Leaving thÂ» mainland, they crossed un
ion Straits to Wolloston Land. With sleds
and dogs they pushed across the. frozen
straits and Island during the following
three years to Grant Land. Toward the
spring of 1892 they found themselves near
Cape Brainard. Hunting In this vicinity,
they learned from the natives of an iron
post left by some explorer. On this they
found the following- marks: â¢
"Eighty-two degrees of latitude north.
83 degrees longitude west."
To the north of this a few miles they
made their camp In May, 1592. This camp
was established at the Junction of two
immense icebergs, and White proposel
that they separate and each take a ten
days' Journey on these diverging points of
ice to find the best hunting. La Joie,
while returning, felt on the seventh day a
tremendous shock, like an earthquake It
meant that the ice had parted and that he
was adrift. ' â¢ . â¢
(Admiral Melville the other day In Wash
ington agreed that La Joie's description
of this phenomenon was accurate.)
The berg drifted to the north. For three
days he lived on fish, hoping against hope
that a wind that had sprung up from the
south would drive him back to .the main
land. For a period of thirty-six days he
was adrift, he says, amid terrible storms
of snow, hall and sleet.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 17.â Two sevens,
fortified by a bet of $30,000 and such a dis
play of nerve as was almost successful in
carrying to success the greatest wheat
deal of modern years, .Â¦ won for Joseph
Leiter a "Jackpot containing about 180,000
and turned the tide â¢ of ' fortune his way,
with thd result that the young Chicago
plunger pulled himself out of a bad hole
and evened up an old score '- with his
bosom friend John W.-Oates, president of
the American Steel > and .Wire Company.
That Incident in which thÂ« two : sevens
figured bo conspicuously was only one of
many that occurred in what was prob
ably the most sensational- poker game
ever played,: East .or West. - f
Unlike many famous poker games, this
one was played for' cash. The game was
played at the Waldorf-Astoria , Hotel.
The participants were: John W. Gates,
Josepn Leiter, L. -L. Smith, John A.
Drake and two . others, whose names
could not Â¦be learned. The proposition
was made and accepted that a . jackpot
should be formed with $1000 "ante" by
each. Tnat started things off* with $6000
In the center and the deal passed twice
without Vopcners" being out. At each
deal each of the r players "sweetened
with a check valued at $100 and when the
pot was anally "broken" there was $7200
in sight. : . ' - Â¦' â¢"â¢ â¢ '.-â¢"â¢ '*Â¦ "
Â¦ Mr. Gates, being first to speak, guessed
that his hand was worth $5000, and after
Mr. Drake had dropped out Mr.'- Smith
opined that , bis cards * also were worth

Leiter Scares /Em Out.
' Young Mr. Leiter ;,was seen to be ner
vously fingering the hand that had been
dealt to him. He showed symptoms of
having received a smile from Dame For
tune. He offered the opinion that his
friends could each Â¦ have another - guess.
Then he pushed $15,000 to the center. Soon
there was more - than $50,000 In the pot.
Leiter looked across at his old friend, and,
remembering - the wheat deal . and Mr.
Armour, remarked: *:,;?: > Â¦Â¦"Â¦
"John, when a man has reached your
age he should quit his bad habits.- There
is only one way to break a man of play
ing poker, and that Is to make it
expensive k f or him. It will cost you Just
$30. 000 to see my. cards. .-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦- /.
His opponent : then looked at the card

was beaten. >/ He had known . Leiter Â¦Â¦> to
"bluff" before, and it- took him quite five
minutes to. make up his mind to "" 1 l a . y

showed down two sevens.an ace. a trry
and a king. : It had been a superb blirJ,
successfully carried out. Â¦. .:
From that moment -the game went Lel
ter's way. 'It continued, with enforced in
termissions.'for. five days and five nights.
During â¢" that ! time ;Â¦* millions iof ?, ; dollars
changed hands, .. being Â¦ shuffled I back * and

llnally.broken about two weeks ago,.when

to (ro to Chicago. , vi
When" a ifinal reckoning was made* J
oseph Leiter | had : recovered . about all that
he had lost on the train on the way East.
Perhaps ; he , had, a , trifling , balance to his
credit. Mr. Smith, Â¦who had played in
uniformly pood luck, was $100,000 .winner;
Mr. Drake and the two unnamed players
aggregated winnings of about $60,000.

Laboratory of Dr. Kilmer & 00.. Horns of Swamp-Root, Tha "VTorld-Faaoia Kidaey TLssiaij '
You know what happens to a sewer
when it becomes clogged, don't you?
Do you know what happens toâ¢the
human system when the kidneys be-
come clogged?.- They are unable to
throw out the Impurities from' the
blood . and become Infected -with
poisons"; they decay, fall apart, and
pass out in the urine; the blood, un-
flltered, carries the poison all through
the system and if not checked death
follows. The kidneys are the eewers
of the human system. :
When your kidneys are not doing
their work, some 'of the symptoms
which prove it to you are pain or dull
ache in the back, excess of uric acid,
gravel, rheumatic pains, sediment in
the urine, scanty supply, scalding irri-
tation in passing it, obliged to go often
during the day and to get up many
times during the night to empty the
bladder; sleeplessness, nervous irrita-
bility, dizziness, irregular heart,
breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the
eyes, sometimes the feet, limbs or body
bloat, loss of ambition, general weak-
ness and debility.
"When you are sick or "feel badly,"
no matter what you think the name of
your disease la, the first thing you
should do Is to afford aid to your kid-
neys by using Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy. â¢
In taking Swamp-Root you afford
natural help to nature, for Swamp-Root
is : the most perfect healer and gentle
aid to the kidneys that is known to
medical science.
Perhaps you are in doubt about your
kidne t ys and want to find out. Here's
a simple test. Take, from your urine
passed when yon arise in the mornlas
about four ounces; place It In a glass
bottle and let It stand for twenty-four,
hours. If. upon examination, you find
any settlings or sediment. If It la milky
or cloudy, or If particles float about In
it, disease has gotten a foothold In your
kidneys and nature la calling for help.
If you have the slightest symptoms
of kidney or bladder trouble, or If there
Is a trace of It in your family history,
you would profit by taking Swamp-
Root every now and then as a pre-
ventive and thu3 absolutely forestall
kidney and bladder troubles.
The famous new discovery, Swamp-
Hoot, has been tested In so many ways.
In hospital , work. In prorate practice,
among the helpless too "poor to pur-
chase relief, and haa proved so success-
fulln every case, that a special arrange-
ment has been made with The Call by

NEW YORK. March 17.-The Herald
to-morrow present the
Â¦trangest and most remarkable
narrative of Arctic adventure and
discovery that has ever come out
of the mysterious land which surrounds
the north pole. Were it set forth in fic
tion It would be noteworthy In the last
degree and would rank .for vividness of
detail and for daring range of human
imaginative power with the beat products
of the brain of Jules Verne.
A French Canadian, Joseph ZoUque la
Joie by name, believes that he has dis
covered the north pole To this he is will-
Ing to go before a court and take solemn
oath. Around the pole he claims to have
found a people differing in language. In
custom. In habits and in appearance from
any who inhabit the" known world.
From his first appearance in the United
States, some five months ago, he haa been
most carefully guarded In order that the
knowledge in his possession might not
become public property until a thorough
and searching investigation was set afoot
as to the probable truth or falsehood of
his statement. La Joie's story is simple.
It contains the additional -elements of con
sistency and straightforwardness. ' More
over. It is Impossible to conceive that he
â¢WilLfibtaln from it aught but unenviable
and rnalodorots "notoriety, providing that
it is proved false. But against it stands
the prior history of Arctic explorations
and all of the myriads of predictions and
conjectures put forward by* theoretical
astronomers, cailors and Arctic explorers
Eince the time when man first attempted
the exploration of the polar regions.
Questioned by Scientists.
First In Boston, afterward in New York
and last week in "Washington the most
celebrated of Arctic explorers and men
of science have met and conversed with
La Joie. At present he remains in Wash
ington by the suggestion of and at the re
quest of Professor McGee of the Smlth
eonlan Institution. La Joie is now un
dergoing the most rigid and searching ex
amination from the experts of the United
States Government, men whose opinions
one way or the other will prove almost
beyond the ground of contest the truth
or the falsity of the astonishing story of
this remarkatle man.
La Joie is a son of the frontier. He
hails from the province of Quebec. Ula

STRIFE IN THE
OFFICE OF THE
CHRISTIAN DAILY
Stockholders. Quarrel . Over
' the Future Policy of
tie Capital.
. - Â¦ â¢ t
Attempt to Perpetuate Rev. Mr.
Sheldon's Methods May Lead to
: Injunction and Damage
Special Dispatch to The Can.
TOPEKA, Kan., .March 17.â Rev. Charles
M. S Sheldon's experiment of conducting a
Christian daily newspaper reached a sen
sational and spectacular climax here to
day. Some of the stockholders want the
Topeka Capital continued permanently as
a Christian daily. Other stockholders op
pose the Idea and insist that the papet-j
lesume its former, methods. Several con- j
ferences , between ; the directors were held
to-day,- but no agreement . was' reached.
Each conference augmented the bitter
feeling. Both sides are standing firm, and
several damage and injunction suits are
threatened.' Indications to-night are that
endless litigation will ensue. '
Â¦ Rev. Mr. Sheldon endeavored to act as
peacemaker, to-day, but his efforts. were
futile. After several attempts to come
to some agreement It was finally arranged
to hold a stockholders' meeting on Mon
day. . - ;
. However, no adjustment of the difficulty
outside of court is probable as both sides
declare that no compromise is possible.
Popenoe Will Not Recede.
The trouble was'brought on by F. O.
Popenoe, president of the company and
majority stockholder, who announced
last night that the Capital Company had
decided to adopt Rev. Mr. Sheldon's
methods and continue the paper as a per
manent Christian . daily . newspaper. He
said the stockholders considered Rev. Mr.
Sheldon's experiment a success and, be
lieving, the time ripe for a religious daily,
had decided to adopt his idea.
It seems that Mr. Popenoe did not con
sult all the stockholders, neither did he
mention the matter to General J.-K. Hud
son, editor in chief of the Capital; Harold
T. Chase, associate editor, or Dell Keizer,
business manager, who are also heavy
stockholders. It is these men who are
creating the trouble to-day. All three
threaten to bring suit If the Christian
daily idea be pressed." .
Mr. Popenoe was seen to-night and ask
ed'lf. he had ariy additional statement to
give out. He replied in the negative.
"Do you stand by your statement of last
night?" he was asked.
VI do."
'.'Will the Capital be continued as a per
manent Christian dally?"
"It will." . ,:Â¦''. i'j?
Others Are Indignant.
: General Hudson, Mr. Keizer and . Mr.
Chase are equally positive in their asser
tions that the Christian daily Idea will
not be - consummated. General Hudson
claims he has a contract with the Capital
Company; the provisions of which are to
the effect that he is constituted editor in
chief of the Capital and has absolute con
trol of Its politics. The contract, he says,
covers a period of years and calls for a
salary of $5000 a year. He . says he not
only was not consulted in regard to the
proposed change of policy but that ho pos
itively disapproves of it. He is extremely
indignant and declares he never will sub
mit-to, an abrogation of his contract:
neither will he surrender his editorship.
In other I words, he declares he proposes
to hold the Capital Company to its con
tract to permit him to dictate the policy
of the paper. ,â¢
Mr. Keizer assumes a similar attitude to
that of General Hudson. Next to Mr.
Popenoe, he is the heaviest stockholder in
the company. "He declares it would bo
suicidal for the Capital to attempt to, be
come a religious paper.
"I will never consent to Jeopardize my
stock In such a foolhardy scheme," he de
clared to-night. "The scheme was all
right for a week, and proved a money
maker: but as a regular thing it would
ruin Â¦ the : paper. The other stockholders
can't work any 'con game* on me. If
they want to run a' Christian daily news
paper let them buy my stock. If they do
not I will fight the scheme to the bitter
end."
For the Money There's In It.
/The scheme of having 1 Rev. Mr. Sheldon
conduct his experiment with the Capital
here this week, it now develops, was first
conceived and clovcrly planned by Mr.
Popenoe. He Is tw financial end of the
Capital and he Is an adept In the art of
judicious advertising. His idea now is to
take advantage of the free advertising the
Capital has 5 been receiving and establish
a religious paper. that would have a cir
culation throughout the United States. It
Isn't a matter of religious principle with
"him. He is looking out for the almighty
dollar. ...â¢Â¦ Â¦ . ,?

NEW YORK, March 17.â Maud S, the
famous trotter, died at Schultz<s farm;
Port Chester, N. V., this morning. She
was brought to the farm from New York
a week ago, and it was intended to use
her for breeding purposes. She- was sick
when she arrived here and had been un

gradually became worse, however, and all
efforts to save- the life of the valuable
animal werÂ« fruitless.

March 17. â At a special meeting of

It' waa ' decided 'to' close 'all busi

enable the merchants to. attend an open
air meeting on the plaza with the object
of drawing up a petition to Governor Gen

gressional decision on the tariff, ona way

to all towna throughout Porto Rloo re
questing like demonstrations. ' , , "
The feeling of uncertainty regarding 1 the
tariff holds business practically ut a
standstill, the merchants -being afraid to
order goods or to advance funds on the
planters' accounts. The ' meeting to-day
was conducted In a calm and businesslike
manner. | The merchants will be satistled
to accept any decision of Congress, .either
free trade, the 26 or the 15 per cent tariff,
but they ask for a settlement of the ques
tion so that business activity may be re
sumed. They decided to take this un
paralleled step only after mature delibera

Slxty country women marched from Na
ranjito. arriving last evening, and 'peti
tioned 1 Governor General Davis to Â«avt
them from starvation and to provide work
and food. Â¦ The women presented a most
pitiable sight. They were barefooted and
ragged, half-naked, dust-covered r and
weary from . their journey. Some of them
were lb.me; all were discouraged.- .
The petition which they presented to
the Governor General tells the story of the
depressing times, no work and the price of
rice, beans and bread beyond reach, fruits
destroyed and , the relief supply dlscon-
tinned, bringing them, and others where
they came from, to starvation.
General Davis promised relief to tht
party and requested thÂ» Mayor to pro
vide transportation. Hl9 reply wax that
there was not a peso ln the treasury an 1
that the police were yet unpaid for their
last two months' work. The party of
women dispersed quietly, some retracing
their steps afoot, others begging easier
conveyance to Karanjlto, which Is twenty

being almost Impassable. /

Pasadena Burglar Who Never Takes
Away Valuables.
PfK-cial ni^ratch to The Call.
PASADENA, March 17.â This city has a
freak rurg'.nr who goes the rounds late
at n : ght and steals nothing except things
to eat. He carries nothing away save in
!:is stumach. At about 1 o'clock the other
evening Miss Alice Talcott awoke to find
a man in her room. She spoke and the
burglar told her he would not hurt her if
rh<! kept still. She kept quiet, but a small
dog barked, awaking Mr. Talcott, and he
<hased the man away. The burglar, it
was found, had passed all kinds of silver
ware and other articles of more or less
value, but had only helped himself to a
lunch. He was Just strolling around the
houi^ when accosted.
To do this be had gone to the tro-Ã¼ble
of cutting the screen ventilator of one of
the handsome houses on South Orange
'irove avenue, the show street of the city,
lie is no cheap burglar, for he chooses
only houses where he knows pood things
to eai are kept. The same hungry burg
lar entTod the hrme of L. J. Merritt, r>4
North Madison avenue, Tuesday night.
He cut his way into the screen porch,
opened a window leading to the kitchen
;>.r.d ciimbÂ«Â»d over the sink. He ate cold
meat, tread, cake and rreserves. He act
ually used a salt cellar that was /made of
fc : .lver. but did not steal it. Last riight
the unknown epicure entered the home of
Miss Root on Center street, but left hun
gry because he stuck his Jimmy in the
door and couldn't loosen it. It was found
sticking there this morning.
If it were possible to con Cense all the
wisdom in thy world into one short sen-
tence it would be Impossible for a young
man in love to remember it five minutes.

GAVE NO HEED
TO THE PROOF
OF INNOCENCE
Military Officers Would Re
lease No One From the
"Bull Pen."
Held as Prisoners Hen Known to
Have Been at Work at the Time
of the Wardner Ex
piosions.
WASHINGTON, March 17.â The Coeur
d'Alene Investigation wad continued before
the House Committee on Military Affairs'
to-day. The cross-examination of Forney,
which was in progress yesterday, was not
resumed to-day on account of the illness
of thÂ« witness.
Allen F. Gill of Spokane, Wash., a me
chanical engineer, wai called to the stand
by Lentz. He held various public posi
tions in Spokane and was master mechan
ic for the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company before he became (master me
chanic for the Tiger and Poor Man Min
ing Company at Burke. In that position,
among other duties, he was charged with
the employment and discharge ot men in
the mine. He testified that he was at
Burke on April 29. 1599, the day the Bun
ker Hill mine was blown up. The town,
was unusually quiet.' On April 30 .all the
men were at work except four. They con
tinued to work until the 3d or 4th of May,
when a number of them, including him
self, were arrested by the military. Ha
testified that he had attempted "to con
tinue at work. He had explained to the
orticer in charge of the troops that the
manager of the mine was absent and that
great property interests depended upon
him. The omcer, Major Morten, replied
that martial law had been declared and
that he would have to go to Wardner.
Gill heard Major Morten order some of
his troops to break into his house. The sol
diers broke in the door. He noticed other
instances of a similar character. He testi
fied to general rude and harsh treatment
suffered by the arrested miners at thÂ©
hands of the troops. Later in the day he
waa released and went back to the mine
with eigrht miners and worked all night
with them to get the water which had
accumulated out of the mine. The only l
disturbance made in Burke that day was !
the disturbance created by the soldiery.
There was no necessity for the soldiers,
he said, as civil processes could have been
served. In his opinion the advent of the
military defeated the ends of justice. The
guilty persons escaped into Montana. Had
the military not been there many of these
would have returned and could have been
arrested.
"Czar* Sinclair's Methods.
Gill testified that he had been informed
that- no releases from the "bull pen"
would be made except on the order of
Uaitlett Sinclair. He had had an inter
view with Sinclair and had presented ani
davits regarding men who had been at
work at Burke when the mine at Ward
ner was blown up, but Sinclair refused to
release them, gaying that he took no stock
in affidavits. Sinclair inforired him that
it was the duty of reputable citizens to
bring affidavits to convict not and not to
acquit.
The witness described conditions ln the
"bull pen." his testimony being similar to
that of other witnesses on this point. He
testified that the â¢ deputies had some
trouble with the firemen under his control
and that the former had -informed lieu
tenant Lyons that the firemen had applied
opprobrious epithets to them. Then Lieu
tenant Lyons had complained of this- to
him (Gill) and said that if such epithet*
had been applied to himself he would have
shot the offender. . Lieutenant Lyons
threatened to send the firemen to the
"bull pen" unless they apologized. The
dignity of the State officers must be
upheld. Lieutenant Lyons said. Later thfc
firemen apologized and the trouble was
amicably settled.
Gill said that the men in' the Coeui
d'Alene district were law abiding. They
were not as a clas9 inferior to those in
any other mining community. There were
some bad men amongr them, but as a class
they were exceptionally good men., The
bad men were not permanent. residents of
the district. So far as the Tiger and Poor
Man mine was concerned, the relations
between the miners and Mr. Culberson,
the active manaerer, were very cordial.
Without disposing of the witness the
committee then adjourned until Monday.

pleasing disposition, and those of the
inhabitants who preserved the traits of
the original owners of the soil were of fine
phveique.
Considering the extensive reforms Cap
tain Leary Ead been obliged to Institute,
he had succeeded very well in boldine the
regard of the remainder of the people of
the inland. *

ments declares the Sherman anti-trust
law to be "specifically applicable to the

further prevent combinations either be
tween ship owners or builders are as fol
lows:

and entitled to compensation, have entered into
any contract, combination or conspiracy, what
ever be the form thereof, for the purpose of
controlling the terminal facilities for shipping
in any port or port* of the United States or for
regulating or increasing the rates or fares for
freight or passengers in trade of commerce
among the several States or with foreign na
tions, or for granting any special rebates or

TRACTION ENGINES FOR RUSSIA.
ONE of the most impressive evidences of the effi
ciency of a protective tariff in building up the
manufacturing industries of a country is af
forded by the recent shipment from San Leandro of
two of the largest traction engines in the" world, to
gether with eight , steel carriages, for use in the
mining districts of Siberia. It is but a short time ago
the free traders were asserting we could not manu
facture any kind of goods as cheaply as we could
buy them from abroad, and that by imposing a pro
tective tariff we imposed a burden upon consumers
for the benefit of a favored class of manufacturers,
thereby committing the economic folly of taxing
profitable'industries to_ support unprofitable 'ones. s*ln5 * In
the face of the recent rapid expansion of our exports
of manufactured goods, that argument has been aban
doned, and the inveterate free traders are now /clam
oring -that since we can compete with any manufac
turing nation on the globe we no longer need protec
tion. " .
The intelligent voters of the United States are* not
likclyvto be deceived by the new arguments of the
foes of protection. It is but a short time ago since
we tried a Democratic tariff, and we have not yet fully,
recovered from the effects of that disastrous experi
ment. Under our present tariff we have revived in
dustry and have so developed our factories that. we
are supplying manufactured goods for all parts of the
world. From our Eastern States there have been
furnished electrical engines for London, locomotives
for railroads^ in India and in Great Britain itself, and
iron bridges for the Soudan. Those shipments froni
our old manufacturing centers were cheering enough,
but now California begins to share in the prosperity,
and : in addition to building ships for Japan we are
supplying engines and cars for Siberia.
The shipment from*san Leandro . will \ serve as the
best advertisement possible in those parts 'of Russia
for California machinery, and as a consequence there

A PLEDGE THAT MUST BE KEPT.
rROM a considerable number of Congressmen,
representing nearly all sections of the Union,
and from every one of those who represent Cali
fornia, a pledge was given last fall to support an
amendment to the war revenue act which would ren
der it impossible for express companies, to continue
the practice of shirking taxes imposed upon them by
the act. So far as the California Congressmen are
concerned the pledge was plain and strong. Up to
this time, however, no step has been taken toward
its fulfillment. â¢ It will be well, therefore, for Boards
of Trade, Chambers of Commerce and other bodies
organized for the purpose of upholding the interests
of merchants and shippers and the community gen
erally to at once remind our Representatives in Con
gress that the people have not forgotten the pledge
and that they_ expect it to be kept. . f
As it stands, that clause of the act which requires
express companies to affix a revenue stamp upon all
receipts or bills of lading is sufficiently straight and
clear to be understood by any intelligent man. The
courts have taken the same view of it as the public,
and by repeated decisions have declared it to be the
duty of the companies to provide and affix the stamp.
Nevertheless, the companies have been 'able to find
lawyers who pretend there is some ambiguity in the
act, and they have succeeded in using the courts to
defeat the courts, and under one pretext or another
have so delayed action that up to this time they are
still able to shirk the tax and impose it upon the
public.
Such bold evasions or defiance of the law as are
shown in this case tend to bring the law itself into
contempt. The people note with growing discontent
the ease with which powerful corporations can make
use of the courts to defeat the laws. Only a short
time ago an official of the Southern Pacific Company
boasted that even if a court were to award damages
to a widow whose husband had been killed by the
negligence of the company, the corporation would
not pay, but would appeal the case from court to
court and prolong it under one pretext or another
until the widow was reduced to starvation or depen
dence on her friends, and all the money due her from
the corporation had been eaten up by attorney fees
and other expenses of litigation. The same course
has been pursued by the express companies in their
aggressions upon the public. They have not openly
announced their contempt of courts and their ability
to stand them off indefinitely, but they have put the
plan into practice, and for two years have continued
to shirk the taxes imposed upon them.
The people of California require their Congress
men to keep the pledge given last fall. They ask that
the revenue act be amended in such a way' that no
shadow of excuse be given for further tax .shirking
by express or other corporations, and that a method bo
provided by which all legal questions arising under
the act can be speedily brought before the -Supreme
Court for prompt adjudication.
If any Congressman regard his pledge as something
of no importance, if he have forgotten it himself or
think the people have forgotten it, it is time for him
to free his mind from such illusions. The pledge
was given in response to a widespread demand. It
was a promise to the people that a grave evil would
be remedied. The evil continues. The public is still
exposed to the aggressions of the express company.
The corporations continue to mock at the courts^and
to shirk the tax. It is a live <issue, and when Con
gressmen meet :hcir constituents this fall they will
iiave to give an account of how they kept that pledge.
It behooves them, therefore, to take action at once.

FATHER DEMPSEY
on the
BATTLE OF DUNDEE.
I have been reading much about ths war
between the "English and the Dutch" in
South Africa, but lately I have com*\
across a new phase of the conflict. I see
by late reports in the. daily papers thai, the
Irish Transvaal Brigade in the first
engagement at Dundee, capturedâ or
"bagged," to use their own words â several
hundred of the Royal Irish Fusiliers.
Now, sir, the last event has interested me
so that I have written a poem on the sub
ject, "a poor thing, 'tis true, but mine
own," as the bard of Avon says. It might
be called "How the Irish Fight For the
Queen," but I have christened it
THE BATTLE OF DUNDEE;
Or,
How President Kruger's Irish Took In
Her Majesty's Hibernians.
Rev. I. Dempsey.
(With apologies to the Ancient Order of
Hibernians, the Knights of St. Patrick,

On the mountain's side the battle raged,
there was no stop nor stay;
Mackin captured Private Burke and En

Fitzgerald got Fitzpatrick, Brannigan
found O'Rourke; â¢
Flnnigan took a man named Lynch and a
couple of lads from Cork.
Sudden they heard Martin cry. "Hands up

McGarry took O'Leary, O'Connell Uok

Rlley captured Cavanaugh while trying to
make a steal.
Hogan caught McFadden, Corrigan found

Dacey took a lad named Walsh; Dooley

Spillane then took O'Madlgan; Shanahan
took Magee; _
While chaÃing Jerry Donovan, Clancy got

cursed the English race, -'
Then found the man who tired the snotâ
'twas a cousin, Martin Grace.
Then Maglnnis caught an A. O. H. who
came from Limerick town,
But Sullivan got an Orangeman from
somewhere in County, Down. .
Hennessy too O'Hara; Hennigan took Mc-

That's how the "English fought the

The sun was - sinking slowly, the battle
rolled along; â
The man that Murphy "handed In was a

Then Rafferty took in Flaherty; O Con

a Belfast lad or two. .' â¢
Some swore that "Old Man Kruger" had
come down to see the fun; _
But the man they thought was "Uncle

Dunn. '"' " - Â¦-Â¦'Â«
Though war may have worse horrors,
'twas a frightful sight to see ;
The way the "English fought the Dutch"
at the battle of Dundee.

A TAX-SHIRKING CORPORATION.
ASSESSOR DODGE is seeking a means of so
increasing the assessment of property in the
city that the administration can raise a rev
enue sufficient to meet the expenses of municipal.'
government under the new charter without imposing
a tax levy much in excess of the dollar limit. To that
end he has under consideration a project of adding
$100,000,000 to the assessed valuation of last.year. It
will therefore be worth his while to take notice of the
extent to which Wells-Fargo Company has shirked
taxes in the past, is shirking them now, and will
shirk them in the future if it can.
Wells-Fargo Express Company- is capitalized at
$8,500,000, and the stock sells from $120 to $122 a
share. The company probably pays taxes in other
localities upon some portion of its capital, but it is
safe to say it does not pay much. The Assessor has
the right ; to require the corporation to show where
it pays taxes and to what amountSi and it is his duty
to exercise that right. When the amount of such out
side taxation has been discovered it should be de
ducted from the total capitalization of the corporation,
and upon all the remainder taxes should be levied in
San Francisco. For example, if it be found that
Wells-Fargo pay taxes in other places upon prop
erty up to a valuation of $2,000,000, that sum should
be deducted from the total capital of $8,500,006, and
it should be assessed for taxes here at $6,500,000.
The extent to which Wells-Fargo Company prac
tices tax shirking constitutes a grave scandal.^ It has
for two 1 years shirked the Federal war revenue tax,
and for more yearsjthan that has shirked State and
county taxes. . Witli the Federal tax Assessor Dodge
has nothing to do, but it is a matter of official con
cern to him that the shirking of local taxes be no
longer" tolerated. There is a deficiency in the treas
ury, and it is imperative the municipal revenues of
the coming year be larger than those which have left
us without street lights after midnight. Before the
Assessor sets about raising the .. assessments upon
property already sufficiently taxed, however, let him
give heed to the tax-shirking corporations and study
the case of the Wells-Fargo Express' Company." â¢
THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
THERE is a deal of loose talk afeainst the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty as an abrogation of the Mon
roe doctrine.
It may be of interest to trace the history of that
doctrine and its cause. "The National Intelligencer"
in 1832 published the following explanatory article on
"The Treaty of Verona": "Among the papers lately
introduced into the discussions in France is the treaty
of Verona, which, having laid our hands on' a copy
of it, it may not be amiss at the present time to bring
to the recollection of our readers. With that view
we offer them the following translation of the treaty,
the authenticity of which cannot be doubted, as it is
recognized- by Chateaubriand, one of the signers to
it, in a book recently published in his own defense.
This translation is from the Journal dv Havre, March
17, 1831. Diplomatists pretend that France is bound
by all the treaties, without exception, that have been
concluded by the late expelled Government and the
other powers. Is it also bound by the following se
cret treaty of Verona?
' The undersigned, specially authorized to make addi
tions to the treaty of the Holy Alliance, after having
exchanged their respective credentials, have agreed as
follows:
Article I. The high contracting parties being con
vinced that the system of representative government is
equally as incompatible with monarchical principles as
the maxims of the sovereignty of the people with the
divine right, enragre mutually In the most solemn man
ner to us<> all their efforts to put an end to the system
of representative government in whatever country It
may exist in Europe and to prevent Jts being introduced
Into those countries where it is not yet known.
Article 11. As it cannot be doubted that the liberty of
the press is the most powerful means used by the pre
tonded supporters of tire rights of nations to the detri
ment of those of princes, the high contracting parties
promise reciprocally to adopt all proper measures to
suppress It not only in their own States but also In all
the rest of Europe. ,
Article 111. Convinced that the principles of religion
contribute most powerfully to keep nations in the state
of passive obedience which they owe to their princes,
the nigh contracting parties declare it to-be their inten
tion to sustain in their respective States those measures
which the clergy may adopt, with the aim of ameliorat
ing their own Interests, so Intimately connected with tho
preservation of the authority of princes; and the con
tracting powers join in offering their thanks to the Pope
for what he has already dene for them, and solicit his
constant co-operation in their views of submitting the
nations.
Article IV. The situation of Spain andÂ» Portugal
unites, unhappily, all the circumstances to which this
treaty has particularly reference. The high contracting
parties, in confiding to France the care of putting an end
to them, engage to assist her' in the manner which may
the least compromit them with their own people and the
people of France by means of a subsidy on the part_pf
the two empires of twenty millions of francs every year
from the date of the signature of the treaty to the end
of the war.
Article V. In order to establish in the peninsula the
order of things- which existed before the revolution of
Cadiz and to insure the entire execution of the present
treaty the high contracting parties give to each other
the reciprocal assurance that as long as their views are
not fulfilled, rejecting all other ideas of utility or other
measures to be taken, they will address themselves with
the shortest possible delay to all the authorities existing
in their States, and all their agents in foreign countries,
with a view to establish connections tending toward the
accomplishment of this treaty. /
Article VI. This treaty shall be renewed, with Buch
changes as new circumstances may give occasion for,
either at a new congress or at the court of one of the
contracting parties as soon as the war with Spain shall
be terminated. . .
Article VII. The present treaty shall be ratified and
the ratifications exchanged at Paris within the space of
six months.
Made at Verona, 22 November, 1522.
(Signed) For Austria, METTERN'ICIL
For France, CHATEAU I3RIAND.
For Prussia, BERRISTET.
For Russia, NESSELRODE.
The Spanish colonies in this hemisphere had re
volted and their independence had been acknowledged
by the United States and Great Britain. The treaty
of Verona foreshadowed the purpose of the signa
tories to aid Spain in their recovery. Great Britain
obtained knowledge of this secret treaty and com
municated it to the United States. President Mon
roe met the emergency in this clause in his message
of 1823:
"We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the
amicable relations existing between the United States
and the allied powers to declare that we should con
sider any attempt on their part to extend^their sys
tem to any'part of this hemisphere as dangerous'to
our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or
dependencies of any European power we have not in
terfered and shall not interfere,. but with the Govern
ments who have declared their independence and
maintained it, and whose independence we have on
great consideration and just principles acknowledged,
we could not viewany interposition for the purpose
of oppressing them or controlling in any other man
ner their destiny by any European power in any other
light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly dis
position toward the United States."
That checked the designs of the Holy Alliance as
far as this hemisphere was concerned, and perusal of
the treaty of Verona will show how all of its purposes
have been negatived by events.
are. likely to be further orders not. only -for traction
engines and cars, but for other iron and , steel ma
chines and implements of all .kinds that our shops can;
furnish. At the present time the condition of; the
commercial routes of the f world is adverse to ; our,
trade in that: direction;- for while it is hardly' more
than 500o v miles in a straight line from California to
the "Siberian district where the engines are to be
used, they will have to traverse more than 20,000 miles
to reach their destination. They go from San
Leandro to New York td be "shipped from that port
instead of from San Francisco. With the completion
of the eastern end of the* Siberian railroad, however,
the" situation will be changed. "T nen California ; will
have advantage over the East in 'the Siberian mar
kets', and instead of San Leandro goods being shipped
from New York, the products of the Eastern manu
facturing districts will be shipped from San Fran
cisco. ".' .. '. " '-?".. . â¢ -,/,
In the , meantime the incident serves to^show.the
vast benefits which have accrued to the industries of
the country from the election of: President McKinley
and the establishment of prosperity upon the firm
basis of protection and sound money. The tunes to
which Republican campaign songs will be set' this fall
will be gathered from the : whirring of spindles and
the sonorous music of forges and looms. We have
assured our own markets with the best manufac
tured goods in-the world, and now we go forth to fur
nish the machinery that is 1 to help civilization for
ward in all parts of the globe, froni the deserts of the
Soudan to the frozen fields of Siberia.

DEAF AND DUMB
BALL PLAYERS
BEAT DENTISTS
Tooth-Pullers Are Unable
to Score Against the
Silent Lot.
Bert Blosser Breaks His Leg Wile
Trying to , Reach, a Baseâ Noisy
Coaches Are Noticeably
"Absent.
Â¦ _*.
The baseball game. between, the dentists
and deaf mutes at the Sixteenth arid Fol
som street" grounds , yesterday afternoon
was brought to a ; summary conclusion at
the end' of the eighth inning by an acci
dent to one of the players, the score at
that time being. 5 to 0 in -favor.. of the
deaf mutes.
Bert Blosser, a young student at the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, was
the victim of the accident, his leg being
broken by a fall received while trying: to
reach his base.. Blosser was a member of
the college dental department nine -which
was lined up against the Deaf and Dumb
Institute nine. .
Â¦ Blosser lined the ball to second and trien
to beat the spheroid to first. First Base
man Brink of the opposing team had his
foot on the bag, and when Blosser rushed
past the base the runner tripped and fell.
On attempting to -rise he discovered that
his ley was broken. Dr. J. D. Hill, who
was umpiring the game, came to Ills as
sistance and placed some temporary
splints on the Injured limb and sent the
young man to his lodgings at 111 Twelfth
street. Blosser comes from Santa Maria,
Santa Barbara County.
When the game ended so suddenly the
deaf and dumb team had five runs, whlls
their opponents were without a tally. The
contest was ' highly interesting and un
usual. On one side were pitted nine young
men whose chief ambition in life is to
wield forceps, and opposed to them were
the Â¦ same number who - were unable to
voice their protests against the decisions
of , the umpire or hear the shouts of,ap
proval that the spectators gave whenever
a good play v was made. Despite their af
fliction the students from the Institute
were able to play the national game in a
manner that would ' have done credit to
those possessed of all their faculties, i
Gloved and ungloved fingers were busily :
engaged during the contest explaining the
points of the game. The wideawake deaf
and dumb players were never caught off
their guard, on bases or in the field.'. A
feature of the game was the absence of
noisy. players on the coaching lines bawl
ing to ' their clubmates to run, slide or
hold their bases. The. man who twirled
for the tooth-pullers was not "rattled" by
the coaches, but was nearly hypnotized
by their moving fingers. . , *
But for the accident to Blosser the name
would have been devoid of Incident, Many
good plays were made by members of both
teams, but nothing -sensational : was re
corded.
The teams lined up as follows:

him without his knowledge or consent. I had
read how Mrs. Kate Lynch of 329 Ellin St., San

using a remedy secretly in his coffee and food
and I wrote to Dr. Haines for a trial. . When
it came I put come in father's coffee and food
and watched him cloeely, but he couldn't tell
the difference, so I kept it up.
"One morning father got up and said he was
hunrrry. . This was a good sign as he rarely ate
much breakfast. He went away when he
came home at pocn perfectly sober I was al-
most frantic with Joy as I hadn't seen him
sober for half a day before in over fourteen
years. After dinner he sat down In 1 the bit;
eacy chair and said, 'Edith, I don't know what
has come over me. but I hate the sight and
smell of liquor and am going to stop, drinking
forever.' This was too much for me and I
told him then what I had done. Well, we both
had a Rood cry, and now we have the happiest
home and the kindest father you can Imagine.
I am so clad you will publish thla experience

The Republican party Is now face to face
with problems of importance not only to us

of the Ideals which were ever before Washing

great men to accomplish works which have re
ceived the commendation of all men and will
receive that of all aces. That I have no fear
as to the results of this work which the party
has to do Is because I know that a high and un.
selfish aim dictates and will dictate the course
pursued. . In . the President, who has carried
the republic triumphant through one great
crisis and who will guide 'it through the un
certain light of the future,' -we find the stead
fast aim to be the right and the ever present
ideal to be a republic which shall be as Just
as if Is powerful. A party with such a leader
will-not fall to perform work to which the
world ;will- give its approval. >;

SUSPECTED OF

Annie Schmid. who resided at 231 Eighth
6treet, died under peculiar circumstances
last evening, and Ernest 'Klllian, a man
with whom ehe has been living, wan ar
rested and taken to the Central police sta
tion, suspected of having murdered her.
Mrs. Schmld became separated from her
husband a number of years ago and has
been living with Klllian for some time.
Last evening the Morgue officials were in
formed that the woman was dead, and
when they reached the scene of her death
they were told by Klllian that she had
taken carbolic acid by accident whllef
treating a stomach complaint.
The man stated that Mrs. Schmld was
dead when he entered the house, about 8
o'clock last evening. * â
An Investigation made by the police
later ehowed that Klllian had been en
gaged in filling bottles with. wine during
the early evening. They found an empty
wine bottle, and on taking out the cork

man was immediately placed under arteat

THE STARVATION PUN
Of Treating Dyspepsia Stomach
Troubles Is Useless and TJr>-
6cientiflc.
ThÂ© almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure for dyspepsia has bÂ«en proven
time and again, but. even now a* course of
dieting Is generally the first thing recom-
mended for a, case of Indigestion or any
stomach trouble. â¢
Many people with weak digestion, as
well as some physicians, consider the first
etep to take In attempting to cure Indiges-
tion Is to restrict thÂ© diet, either by se-
lecting certain foods and rejecting others
or to cut down the amount of food eaten
to barely enough- to keep soul and body
together, in other words, the starvation
plan Is by many supposed to be thÂ© first
essential.
All this Is radically wrong. It Is foolish
and unscientific to recommend dieting to
a man already suffering from starvation
because indigestion Itself starves every
orpan, nerve and fiber In the body.
What people with poor digestion meet
need Is abundant nutrition, plenty of good,
â¢wholesome, properly cooked food, and
something to assist the weak stomach to
digest it
This la exactly the purpose for which
Stuart's Dyspepsia. Tablets are adapted
and the true reason why they curÂ« the
worst cases of stomach trouble.
Eat a sufficient amount of wholesome
food aad after each meal taks one or two
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to promptly
digest It.
Ia this way thÂ© system Is nourished and
the overworked stomach rested, becatisÂ©
thÂ« tablets will digest the food whether
the stomach works or not, one grain of
the active digestive principle In Stuart'Â«
Dyspepsia Tablets belns sufficient to
digest SOOO grains of meat, eggs or other
albuminous food.
Dr. Harlandson and Dr. Redwell recom-
mend these tablets In all cases of defect-
ive digestion because the pepsin and dias-
taste in them are absolutely free from
r.r.tmal matter and other impurities and
being pleasant to the taste are as safe
and harmless for the child as for the
adult.
All drugstores sell this excellent prepa-
ration and the daily use of them after
meals will be of preat benefit, not only as
an immediate relief but to permanently
build up and Invigorate the digestive or-
gans.

at the Cathedral to a large and approv

were freely reviewed. Introducing his
subject, Father Yorke said:
On this day the world over Irishmen and the
sons of Irishmen celebrate the memory of him
who first brought their fathers tidings of the
great Joy. The day has ceased to be merely
the festival ot a nation and has become tha
festival of a race. As the Irish people and
their sons have scattered all over the world
they have carried their reverence for this day
with them. As in olden times the scattered
sons of Israel, whether on the banks of the
Nile or In Babylon, turned their faces toward
Jerusalem and God's holy mount when they
lifted their hearts In prayer, so all the world

ritory than that bordering upon the seven seaa.
Irishmen and the children of Irishmen worship

nor the observance of the day seems to de
crease. In cpite of sneers and In spite of Jecra,
In sÃite of .the promptings of a false pride and
of avarice, the children of the Gael ktlll do
honor to the day and do honor to it with in
creasing solemnity. - The reason that the day Is
immortal Is that It represents something that
cannot die. It Is not a mere sentimental ob
servance: It Is not merely a political or a mere
patriotic observance. The day stands for great
truth It stands for a principle that Is above
all earthly policies, and It Is because the Celtic
race feels and understands that principle that
the day still continues and grows more popu
lar.
Â¦ In .unfolding the mission of the : Irish
race the speaker said It was not military,
not fundamentally patriotic nor commer
cial. Â¦- The .Celt always had and always
would stand for right and Justice. The
Celt Is willing that the glittering attrac
tions of the world should be enjoyed by
others, that, he might reserve his strength
and energies for, expounding the laws of
' the great Master and prepare for the
glories of the kingdom to come.
â¢A beautiful picture was drawn of the
lone Â¦ lad from Gaul carried into the Em
erald his captivity there, escape,
education and final call for the great spir
itual work that crowns St. Patrick one of
the immortals: In .answering the charge
that Catholics were v intolerant and dis
posed to Â¦Â¦ keep - the Â¦ masses in Ignorance
the speaker -became ,- quite : fiery. He
brought to the Â¦ attention of his hearers
the facts of early. Protestant -Intolerance,
in j both â¢: England . and Â¦ America, and said
If ever the time came. that Catholics pre
dominated Protestants would pever have
to : suffer from t such : penal - laws as . they
had i enacted ' for . Catholics.
-Father Yorke was . unmerciful in speak
ing of those: of the Queen's soldiers who
had been , granted the right , to wear the
shamrock. They were "mercenaries who,
hired by English gold., did :England's

oppose also : the effort ; of another flag to

ing upon them a ''rotten government and

LOS ANGELES. March 17.âWhat
ever enthusiasm the hearts of the
younger element of 'the Republican
party of Los Angeles contained was
allowed full vent at the banquet
that was to-night given by the Toung
Men's Republican League, attended by
423 guests. Contrary to expectations.
Governor Henry T. Gage accepted the In
vitation to' attend and became the first
speaker, responding to the toast, "Party
Danger." Governor Gage's remarks were
enthusiastically received as ha declared
himself in favor of expansion and that
the flag should remain where planted.
He scored the newspapers for the as
saults that he declared had been made
upon him by the bosses,' in editorial
chairs, but in the face of these he called
a special session that triumphed In select
ing a United States Senator. "
"Shall these newspaper bosses be al
lowed to dominate the State or shall the
people be allowed to triumph and have
their own thoughts?" he asked. This
was received with shouts of "No, no."
The coming contest was dwelt upon by
Hon. Robert G. Evans, national commit
teeman from Minnesota, The speaker
directed his remarks to the duties that
devolved upon them as young Republicans
and warned them that adherence to prin
ciples and constant battling assured^ suc
cess. , Â¦ * .....
M. H. de Toung, in speaking on "The
Future of California," answered" Gage's
/tirade by saying that he had been com
pelled to listen to a lecture as â¢ a news
paper man on how to conduct his,busi
ness, but when an attempt was made to
cram down the throats of. the. people of
the State a manâ meaning Burnsâ that
they did not want, he is one of the forty
three newspaper men of the State that
refused to submit to it and he pleaded
guilty to having bitterly fought against
this attempted fraud.. .
Organization of the Club.
The Young Men's Republican League of
Los Angeles is one of the noted Institu
tions of the southland. It was established
in 1&02, and has the distinction of being
the first club in Southern California to
affiliate with the National and State
League. A. \V. Kinney was its first presi
dent.
The best attended politico-social func
tions of Los Angeles are the annual ban
quets under the auspices of the club. The
banquet to-night in Elks' Hall was at
tended by many men of brilliant accom
plishments. After the dinner the follow
ing programme of exercises was observed:

HOW TO SEPARATE
THE GOLD FROM
CAPE NOME SAND
The ease with which a. person can roach
Cape Nome "and the ' fact ' that; gold has
been found there mixed with the sand^ of
the beach. will cause a large immigration
to that locality during the coming spring
and summer. The primary object of every
person going to Cape Nome is to get 3ome
of this gold, and the fact of its existence
under the conditions found has caused an
endless : number of 'devices to be dffered
the public for separating the gold from tho
foreign bodies associated with it.
To find a ablution of this problem the
first l consideration should be the condition
in wiich^lt exists, and we find that though
fine, it is "freeâ that is. it is not found an
part and parcel of any other mineral cr
rock, but is found In separate and distinct
particles, generally very fine but always
by themselves. These particles have been
settled by nature In layers, or strata, be
neath the surface, of the soil in this local
ity. It was the great specific gravity of
the gold which produced this condition.
In conjunction with the gold, and In tho
same strata, is found a black and ruby
sand of very nearly" the same specific
gravity as the gold, but the three bodies
are Â¦. always found separate and distinct
from the loam and clayey soil of the re
gion. -- ; Â¦ ,v . ' '' â¢ â¢
Common sense suggests a machine whicH
would put this gold through an operation
similar to that so successfully completed
by, nature, which would settle the gold in
another place, viz.. the, sack of the miner.
The Krogh Manufacturing Company, 9 to
17 -Stevenson street. San Francisco, has
built a machine on lines which accomplishes
this obie.ctr-a'ma-chlne which will handle
200 tons of this sand a day, requires but
one horsepower and -one miner's
inch of water. The machine is simple In
construction 1 and can be seen in operatloi
daily at their shops. An exhaustive book
let has been Issued explaining the details
of construction, the use of centrifugal sand
pumps in connection with this work,
which the Krogh Manufacturing Company
would be pleased to give any person wish
ing .the same.. TJut the Krogh Manufac
turing Company., guarantees this machine
to save 95 per cent of the free gold in any
sand that will settle or amalgamate, and
their guarantee Is good. â¢ â¢

National Editorial Associa
tion Arrives in San
Francisco.
Eastern Newspaper Men Are Enthu
siastic Over the Natural Rich
ness and Beauty of the
Golden State. '
â¢ ?
The mejnbers of the National Editorial^
Association who have been touring the'
southern part of the country, starting
from New Orleans, arrived in this city
yesterday morning from Bakersfieid. The
delegation, consists of about one hundred
people, who are being taken over the'
country -undar the direction of C. A. Jack-
Mm of the Southern Pacific Company.
They travel* in three Pullman sleepers",
Â¦w hich are their hemes in whichever city
they may be visiting, as well as tneir_
means ot transportation while on the rails.;
The entire party is onthusfastic over Cali
fornia and the treatment 4.hey have re
ceived while journeying through the State.
Said Charles J. Berrylield of the St. Paul
Review yesterday: "We are simply en
raptured with California and the people
ire have met on our tour of the southern
part of your splendid State. We have
seen Los Angeles, Riverside, Redlands,
Bakersfieid, Fresno and, in fact, alt of the
principaJ cities between here and San
i'if go. and I must say that there is noth
ing like it in the Kast. One could hardly
bflieve that one was still in America and
that It w*s winter time. Your valleys,
larming- and fruit lands, in fact, every
thing you have is about as near perfection
as it is possible for nature to create any
thing, and the hospitality of the people Is
en a par with the fertility of the lands
th*y till." o
'â¢yes.' broke in F. H. Hall of the Jollet
Daily News, "we have had an exceedingly
enjoyable trip ami have learned much that
WÂ« did not know berore. We knew, of
course, in a general way of your wheat
fields, your mines and your cattle ranges,
and we had heard of your fruits and or
Â«nge groves. Hut what we did not know
was that you had oil in addition to your
other treasures. While at Bakersfieid and
Fresno we inspected the oil field* of that
section of the country and were astound
ed at their richness. They will In time,
in. my opinion, prove almost as much of a
bonanza as your mines. As to your cli
mate and scenery there Is nothing finer
in the United States." t
The visitors spent yesterday visiting the
different points of interest about the city
and the evening was passed inspecting
i.Tiinatown. * '
To-day the editors will leave for Mon
terey, where they will remain until to
morrow. From Monterey they will visit
Santa Cruz and San Jose, spending a
couple of hours in each place and return-
Ing to Oakland mole in time to leave at
S:l5 in the evening for the East. .

acted ! reasonably In taking Christie into
their, employ, as he -bore a good reputa
tion, but nevertheless the. amount of his
peculations and the sum of $850 paid to
P. T. Barclay for expert ing his books
must not be charged against the trust
fund, but against the trustees. Judge
Hebbard ; further finds : that the whole
property of the trust-estate which cams
into the hands of the trustees under the
decree of distribution 'ln the estate' of
Alexander Montgomery on the 15th day
of April, 1895, was of the value of W,o4<j,
243 99. It consisted of notes and mort
gages of the value of $581,894 18, bonds of
the value of $10,5u0; cash, $858 39; stocks,
$7675; book, accounts, $137 10, and lands
valued at $442,179 32. On April 6, 1899,' the
estate was valuer 1 , at $1,201,976 35, exclusive
of $23,000. paid to Annie A. and Hazel O.
Montgomery. Judge Hebbard finds that a
reasonable compensation to be allowed
the trustees for services rendered is $40,
000, to be apportioned as follows: .
For the period ending with the death of
W. F. Goad, $33,041 10, and for the period
extending from the death or W. F. Goad
to the time" Annie Montgomery attains her
majority the sum of $6058 90. From this
amount $5000 heretofore paid the trustees;
$12,339 32, the amount embezzled by Chris
tie, and $850 paid the expert must be de
ducted, leaving a balance of $14,851 78 to
be divided between Foster and the Goad
estate and $6955 90 extra compensation to
Foster as surviving trustee. To the at
torneys for the, trustees, Platt & Bayne
and van R. Paterson, the court allows
Â¦ $12,000. The amount now in the hands of
the trustees belonging to the estate of
Annie Montgomery amounts to $10,092 15.
Judge Hebbard's decision was rendered
In the case of A. W. Foster, as the sur
vivor of W. F. Goad and A. W. Foster, as
the trustees for Annie A. and Hazel -G.
Montgomery, and Ella Goad Hooker as
the executrix of the will of W. F. Goad,
against Annie A. Montgomery and Hazel
G. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Rodgers and
Arthur Rodgers, in the settlement of the
account of â¢ the trustees under decedent's
will. ; â

People hesitate at the statement that
the famous food Grape-Nuts yields as
much nourishment from one pound as
can be absorbed by the system from ten
pounds of meat, bread, wheat or oats.
Ten pounds of meat might contain
more nourishment than i one pound of
Grape-Nuts, but not in shape that the
system will absorb as large a proportion
of, as the body can make up from one
pound of Grape-Nuts.
This food contains the selected parts
of wheat. and. barley', which are. prepared
and by natura! means predicated,
transformed into grape sugar, ready for
immediate assimilation. People in all
parts of the country can testify to the
value of Grape-Nuts food.

Norris & Rowe's big trained animal
show will give performances at Mechan
ics' Pavilion at 2:30 and 8 p. m. to-day.
This will conclude the j most remarkably
successful' engagement ever experienced
by a similar attraction In this or any
other city. For the past two weeks the
huge building's seating capacity has been
tested at every performance, and on sev
eral occasions many people were turned
away, unable to secure even standing
room.- This Is a record Messrs. Norris &
Rowe may well feel proud . of ,- for when
the people of San Francisco put . their
stamp of approval on an 'entertainment
by patronizing it. It must have merit.
Norrls & Rowe's show Is without ques

its kind ever seen on this coast, and the

The rush to the gold fleius of the frozen I
north and the departure of the cannery |
fleet for Alaska will begin about the same |
time. There will be fifty-three vessels
of all rips engaged In the salmon busi
ness and probably the same number will
run from San Francisco and Puget Sound
to Nome. Between eight and ten thou
sand men will be employed in the can
neries and on the vessels, while the
transportation companies expect to land
25,000 gold hunters in Nome before the
spring is over. Every fisherman who goes
north on the cannery fleet will come home
with a'comfprtable bank account.
Of the cannery fleet the Alaska Pack
ers' Association owns forty-one vessels,
as follows: Shipsâ Servia, St." Nicholas,
Tacoma, Oriental, Slntram, Bohemia,

and Undaunted; steamers. Excelsior,
Equator and Jeanie. and schooner Queen.
Of these the Kate Davertport has sailed
for Prince Williams fiound, the Jeanie for
Prince Williams Sound via Seattle, the
Equator for Chignik Bay, the Prosper for
Bristol Bay and the Premier for Bristol
Bay via Blalne. The Thistle also nailed
for Bristol Bay, but had to put back on
account of a slight break in her ma
chinery. All the other vessels are now
being rapidly got ready and the next ffew
weeks will be very busy ones with the
salmon packers.
The bark Agate is the latest addition to
the salmon fleet. She came out here from
New York during the first rush to the
Klondike with the members of the Kings
County Mining Company of New York.
After landing the gold hunters she went
Into the coast trade and has been carry
ing lumber and coal ever since. She was
sold to the owners of the B. P. Cheney
and has been overhauled and refitted for
her new venture.

HIM TO LEAVE
A HAPPY HOME
Frank Adams, a Mere Child,
Beats His Way From.
Pittsburg.
Mayor Will Place Him in Boys'; and
Girls' Aid Society and Inform
His Parents of His .
\ Whereabouts.
' > '
Frank Adams, a boy 14 years of age,
visited the Mayor's office 'yesterday and
made a'pitiful appeal to Secretary Fay to
be returned to his home in Plttsburg, Pa,
He stated that he had run away from his
parents', home. on October 6 of last year,
and reached this city day before yester
day by beating his way on cabooses of
freight trains.
The boy ascribes his sad plight of being
alone and penniless in a strange city to
his inordinate love for reading dime nov
els. He says his father is OScar E. Adams,
a compositor on the Pittsburg Chronicle-
Telegraph, residing at 2407 Wylie avenue.
The Mayor decided to send -Frank to the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, and in the
meantime the boy's parents will be com
municated with- with a view to sending
him back home. .. .
"I left home last . October," said the
young runaway, "with $10, which my
mother gave me to buy, a suit of clothes.
"I read so many dime novels that I had
an Idea that San Francisco was a mining
camp and that gold could be picked up on
Goat Inland. The men In the cabooses
were good to me and I went to. Chicago.
From there I rede on the tender of the
fast mail to Omaha. The engineer made
me help passing the coal and do other
work for my passage.

"THE SPIRIT OF THE CELT."
St. Patrick's Day Ode by Charles D. South.
Â»
HAIL, blest day of Irish glory, crown of Erin's age of gold,
Radiant with St. Patrick's story, gemmed with precious thoughts
of oldâ
When the Bel-tin flickered, dying, as he lit the Paschal fire.
And the Druids whispered, sighing, "Baal, behold thy funeral pyre!"
When his mystic leaf expelled the lingering spirit-host x of Night,
And the Celtic soul beheld the Triune God's transcendent Light!
Tara** saint-sown seed hath flourished, wondrous plant, Time's path
along.
By the blood of martyrs nourished, by the storms of hate made strong!
Fruit it bears that, through the -ages, strengthens hero-souls that lead
In the battles Justice wages that the millions may be freed;
And the magic of that manna hah the Irish spirit felt,
Till, where Right unfolds her banner, there shall Glory find the Celt!
.Â¦'Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦; ';Â¦:**' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ .
He hath faced the despot's power on a thousand gory fields.
Loud in Freedom's cause this hour rings the faithful brand he wields:
For he treks the rugged regions of the Afric kop and veld.
Where the handfuls teach the lecions that the tyrant's doom is knelled!
Where Oom Paul, grim Afrikander, steadfast stands, but not alone.
In his simple faith far grander than the Queen upon her throne!
Fell he smiteth for his sireland 'mid the volkstrand battle's roar â
There is triumph for. old Ireland in each victory of the Boer!
Though remote the strujfÃrlirisi nation, yet each bolt for Freedom hurled
Speeds mankind's emancipation in the monarch-ridden world I
Speeds old Cronje's prayer the breaking of the day when morning's
win gs *
Flash o'er sovereign peoples shaking down the thrones of cast-off
Be Saint Patrick's name our omen, and the Sunburst yet shall flame
O'er that isle by Saxon foemen cursed with rule of blood and shame!
Then, beneath its rays of glory. Art and Science, hand in hand.
Shall repeat old Erin's story when her land was Learning's land!
Innisfallen's sons shall greet her as in classic days of yore,
Shandon's joybells ring the sweeter.Tara's harp be mute no more!
"Lord, how long?" a voice appealeth. in oppression's doleful night:
"Lord, how long?" on darkness stcaleth the invisible light!
The republic's dawning glimmers over Irish hill and lea;
In reflected beauty shimmers the bright Emerald of the Sea!
Rise, O Sun, redeem our sireland; Emmet's tomb, the shamrock's sod!
Speed the Freedom-light" on Irelandâ Thou, our Hope, Almighty God!

terms of eulogy and endearment, while
the United States, the adopted country of
Erin's loyal and devoted eons, came in
for the lion's chare of the glowing tribute.
There were no decorations in the ban-
Quet-room other than a large American
nag at the head of the table, on either
side of which were suspended two beau
tiful flags Indicative of the Irish nation
and surmounted by the white flag with
embossed shamrocks, co dear to the Irish
heart. The music of the evening, ren
dered by an excellent string orcnestra,
was devoted principally to the sweet se
lections for which the Emerald Isle is
famous all over the world, and were in
terspersed with American national airs,
that excited the enthusiasm of the Irish-
American citizens present.
The guests of honor were Major General

Kr;lgbts of 6t. Patrickâ Dear Sir: I wlEh It was
within my hopes that I could accept the kind
invitation of the Knights of St. Patrick to
their anniversary dinner In San FrandÃCO on
the 17th of March. Many years have passed
since I last saw San Francisco, but I still re
tain the brightest and most genial memories
cf the days I spent there.
The condition of my hÂ«aJth renders It impos
sible for me to travel just at present and I can
only send you this written expression of my
deep and heartfelt sympathy with the objects
cf your celebration.
I am full of hope for the new chapter of
Irish national history, which opens with the
restoration of our unity as a political party
and I am firmly convinced If that we ourselves
hut stand together, even the veterans among
us m&v expect to see the complete triumph of
our home-rule cause. Very truly yours,
JUSTIJC McCARTHT-

affair was admirably conducted, the
programme elaborate and Interesting
throughout and the occasion was a mem
orable one. Â¦- Â¦ v ' . ".
While honoring the memory of their
patron saint the Irish-Americans took ad
vantage of the opportunity^ to express
sympathy for the struggling Boers of
South Africa, and with the open-hearted
generosity that has always been charac
teristic of their race donated the entire
proceeds of the day's entertainment to the
alleviation of the sufferings of those who
are fighting under the leadership of Oom
Paul for their country and their freedom.
The decorations of the Pavilion were a
distinctive feature of the celebration.
Streamers of buntingâ the emerald of Ire
land and the orange of the Transvaal
covered the bare boards of the galleries.
The flag of Old Erin, the stars and stripes
of Uncle Sam and the banner for which
the Boers are fighting were everywhere
In evidence. Over the platform was a por
trait of the. President of the little South
African republic. Above It were the words
"God Save Ireland," and beneath "Liberty
or Death." . . Â¦'â¢Â¦Â¦<Â¦
. The afternoon exercises opened with an
overture by the band, "Salute to: Erin.'.'
This was followed by the address of the
president of the day, Thomas F. Barry,
who spoke in part as follows:
The celebration of St. Patrick's day has pecu
liar significance this year. While its religious
aspect is not lost sight of there are two , ele
ments entering into it of unusual importance.
The claim or belief of an influential portion of
the American ! people that we are an Anglo-
Saxon nation makes it necessary that* those
who are racially: distinct from that ambiguous
conglomerate should Insist, upon the 'true Idea
of Americanismâ that It Is a happy union and
fusion of all the best elements of the noblest
and best European- peoples. â¢-, - ...
The studious endeavor of Great, Britain's
rulers to misrepresent the Irish attitude toward
the empire and Its wanton aggressions in South
Africa renders It- Imperative that an earnest
protest, should be recorded by men of Irish
birth or sympathies all over the world wherever
they are free to express it. The order of .the
Queen that the shamrock be worn by Irish sol
diers on the 17th of March Is a national humili
ation; the display of the green flag over the
Mansion House in London will show the con
tempt which the Briton feels for the attempt
of the Celt to spurn his yoke; and the plaudits
for the. lrish soldiers. by the British public ex
cite the same abhorrence that Christian fathers
must have " felt Â¦ when the ' Ottoman ; empire
crowned . with laurels ; their - sons who filled
the ranks of her Janizaries. ' .-â¢.;Â¦Â¦ â¢ , -:
â¢Â¦Â¦" Believing., that all true Americans are -still
loyal to the principles of the Declaration of In
dependence, and that the worst republic is bet
ter than the best monarchy, ~we have thought
that no more powerful protest ' could be. made
against English policy, and no more noble cause
could be served, Â¦ than by ; devoting the proceeds
of our celebration to the aid of the widows and
orphans of the valiant Boers."
Tlie Programme.
A programme ; of â¢â¢ literary and musical
numbers and specialties followed. The
participants were forced by the applause
that greeted them to to encores
The features [of the evening's celebration
were the poem by Charles D.' South, the'
oration . by Thomas W. Â¦ Hickey and the
ovation that was given Miss Sannie Kru
ger, niece of Oom Paul.:-: _Â¦ ,: Â¦ ,-.-
Mr.tHlckey's address was a masterpiece
and whatever S enthusiasm | slumbered -in
the audience was " awakened by 1 his elo
quence. Portions of his oration > follow: : '
Mr. President. Ladies and â¢ Gentlemen: On
the feast of the Tabernacles the sons of. lsrael
come together to , commemorate their desert
wanderings in the old time. - With a common
ir.ntlr.ct they bring' up the : memories of past
glory, of centuries of suffering. ln many lands,
and they murmur with a sadness deep as Jere
miah's, "Thou shalt no more be called the
Lady of Kingdoms. Thy pomp is brought
down to the crave and the worms cover thee.
Thy sun is gone down while It is yet day.
Irishmen, I call upon you to testify. Tou

you have fled by night from the land that was
yours; have hidden by day in the mountain

v : Ireland's Woes.
O peasant men , and women of . Erin, what
words shall? I find to paint your. woes or give
your injuries utterance?; On you has fallen the
heat and burden iof these , eight centuries of
strife and bitterness. Tour leaders might, face
the scaffold with calm eyes, for beyond it they
saw everlasting fame and a nation's gratitude.
Tour generals gave up their lives In your de
fense, but Â¦ they knew that monuments . would
rise where their blood wet the earth. But you.
the heroic common people of Ireland, what was
there to compensate you for the confiscation of
your 'crops, Â¦ the burning of Â¦ your homes; Â», the
starvation of your families, the dishonor by Â¦ a
brutal soldiery of your pure â¢ wives and daugh
ters, the murder ! of ( your sires and your sons,
the desolation of your country and the exile of
your kindred? On you fell the weight of these
penal laws that made it a felony for you to go
to school or to church; that gave you no rights
against' an ''Englishman; : that \ laid* you open
forever ito . the caprice lof foreign masters I and
the' extortion of foreign landlords.- ;.-.-'<
-Wonder not, \ then.- that Erin's sons,, who have
peopled the earth, ' have carried | with them I the
love of freedom. In every clime, . under every
sky -.wherever Celt has set his foot he has been
an apostle of liberty. Wherever the battle of
freedom has raged, there the Gael, has been in
the foremost- rank.-. Wherever a -few; brave
hearts Â¦ have 1 made -a i stand against " oppression
and tyranny, ' there has been the Celt, inspiring,
encouraging, p consoling,'/ fighting, *â¢ dying, sr No
matter what the odds; no matter, what the flag;
no matter though I the | people |be I strangers and
the language of his tentmate unknown to himâ

Hope for the Green Isle.
Â¦ Gentlemen, there : Is. hope for â¢ Ireland, hope
: for liberty. Remember the cheering words of
the > old church. . "Sursum : corda, lift up ; your
heaj-ts, take courage." God Is. working on our
aide. His plans take in centuries as though
they; were moments. England in her panoply
of cold and steel is yet a temporal thing and
her prosperity may pass away like a cloud.
Her empire is built upon wrong principles and
cannot endure. England is a vampire sucking
the blood of subject colonies. The germ of
rottenness is in her tissues and the huge body
must : in time < disintegrate. ,
- The measure -of England's '. Iniquity is full.
The . Belshazzar of nations, drunk I with power
and ' vainglory. -Is Â¦ silting . at the last banquet

FIREMAN'S FUND TEAM
DEFEATS COLLEGE MEN
An Unexciting Contest 'at Recrea
tion Parkâ Manner in .Which. .
the Garnet Was Played. %r '
The University of California nine was
defeated yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Park by the Fireman's Fund team by
a score of 4 to 1. â¢ Two hours were devot
ed to playing the game, which was as un
exciting as a game of marbles. Berkeley's
representatives showed up to disadavan
tage and will have to overcome many
faults if they hope to 'defeat the wearers
of the cardinal when they next meet. '
The football battery, composed of "In
dian Pete" Kaarsberg and "Lodombtor"
Smith, was not as brilliant as expected.
Kaarsberg lacked speed and Smith
dropped the ball so often that spectators
thought it was too hot to hold. Braley
played the game for the college team. He
stopped a number : of hot grounders and
shot the ball over to Hamlin on first with
the speed of a bullet. Collins, the dimin
utive right fielder of the Insurance team,
distinguished himself .by anaking a cir
cus catch and nailing five difficult fly
balls. â¢ i
Nurse went into the ; box for Berkeley
in the latter part of the game. He had
a etraight, speedy ball with ', fair control.
Follansbee, the auburn-haired first base
man of the Fireman's Fund team," practi
cally.won the game . for â¢ his ; side .In â¢ the
first inning. After two players had been
retired on a double play Krug and Mos
kiman reached their, bases on a hit. and
a base on balls. Follansbee then lifted the
ball over short for three bases, scoring
two runs and coming in. himself -on.; the
next play. Hammond added another in the
third, after which there was a void.
The only exciting incident In tbe entire
game presented Itself in the ninth inning.
Berkeley was taking its last inning at bat
and two men had been retired. The insur
ance players then woka up to the fact that
the ball would go toto t the last r man
who handled ' it. McKeown hit to
Dunn who started . to ; run across
the diamond to ,: score the out, but
seeing that he would" not make It
threw to Follansbee. Moskiman cast
coveted eyes on the . sphere and Jumped
In time to block . the ball and McKeown
was safe. Hunter followed with a hit and
there was another wild , scramble. - Ham
lin hit Â¦to short. Hunter s was blocked at
second and Berkeley was defeated.

then he became proud.
The gentle art of boxing, he thought,
was quickly learned and he smiled as he
planned to teach his instructor a few
points in his own game. Now Brandon is
a past master in that ministry where a
jolt on the jaw Is a sermon and the solar
plexis is the seat of wisdom. Brandon has
tried conclusions with Corbett and when
in action is something like an animated
battering ram. But Dr. Voorsangtr didn't
know that until after it all happflned.
A few days ago he rallied his instructor
on his mildness with the gloves. "I'm
afraid you are getting a little stale," hÂ»
said. "You'll have to warm up or I*ll have
to get somebody else who is in my class."
The reverend gentleman madÂ« a lunge at
the head of an imaginary foe, side
stepped, ducked and smiled triumphantly.
The boxing Instructor looked at him and
returned a Quizzical smile. "You're all
right, doctor," he said. "You are getting
along famously as It is." '-jf'ri

Brandon let himself out, but perhaps it
is best to tell the rest of the story. Dr.
Voorsanger proved himself to be no mean
antagonist. He landed, two or .three .stiff
rights and rushed his man, who ducked
to save himself from a Jolt on the point.
That was all Dr. Voorsanger remembered
for a while. lie felt as if somebody had
hit him on the jaw with a telegraph 'pole
and the boxing instructor -was bending
over him beseeching him to believe that
it was all a mistake: that his hand slipped
and that positively under no circum
stances would it ever happen again.
Dr. Voorsanger did not hear all theso
entreaties, as he was busy trying to pre
vent himself from swallowing his two
front teeth.. He saved the teeth, but
promised his Instructor never to get gay
again, but to confine himself strictly,
rigidly and humbly to that sphere in
which he is admittedly an ornament. He
fays, though, that he lost more flesh in
that little affair than he did in a whole
month of exercise before.

Prince of Veronia Finishes
First in ; the. Crescent
City Derby.
Schorr's Colt, Heavily Backed to An
nex the Prize, Finds the Lumpy
Track Too Great a
Handicap.
Â¦ >
NEW ORLEANS, March 17.â A home
trained horse' and a stable with strong
local- affiliations to-day won the richest
prize of the local racing season, when
Prince of Veronia, owned by A. H. and
D. H. Morris, galloped home first in the
Crescent City Derby. Save by his trainer,
the colt had 'not' been figured a ..winner.
Sidney i Lucas and , F. â¢'.W.. W. Brode â¢ divided
favoritism in the betting, though the sup
port accorded the former was the best
and his price shortened from 2^ toM
to 11 to 6, while Brode's went back. from
twos. Â¦ \.} '
The start was good and prompt. Bo
land took The Conqueror to the front with
a rush and, rounding the first turn, opened
up a gap of a length and a, half. Brode
following closely. Before the half mile
was reached The Conqueror had shot his
bolt and yielded to Sidney Lucas. Brode
struggled to the front again in the next
furlong, but as ' they passed the three
quarters they, were neck and neck, Sidney
Lucas gaining at every ; stride. Burns
rode Brode with might and maJn.'but the
colt was in the worst of the going and
he could never get up. McJoynt had
placed Prince of Veronia fifth all the way
and kept him- on the best part of the
track.-In the last sixteenth he found'an
opening and. coming through with a rush
caught Sidney Lucas,. who was tiring.and"
beat him out a head. v Lamplighted would
not try a foot: of the way.
victory in ., the St. Patrick
handicap was the first of the surprises

lay. There were in all eighteen courses
which had to be run twice because of
tricky hares or where dogs became un

SLAUGHTER OF
FIRST CHOICES
AT TANFORAN
Sardine at Short Odds Fell
Easy Prey to Vesuvian
; in^Fast Time.
St. Patrick's day at Tanforan Park was
celebrated by the defeat of all six favor
ites. By far the biggest upset of . the
afternoon, and one which proved very ex
pensive to the heavy bettors, was the col
lapse of ! Sardine In the seven-furlong run.
Corrlgan's filly carried 107 pounds and was
made the medium of a plunge -at short
odds.. The only other starters were Vesu
vian, the three-year-old half brother to
Geyser, with * 112 pounds In the saddle;
and St. Anthony, against which 75 to 1
could be had. "When sent away from the
post Piggott at once went out. with Vesu
vian, and despite Henry's urging Corri
can's fleet filly could never get her head
in front, going to pieces altogether at the
finish., Vesuvian covered the distance in
I&PAt in the face of a stiff breeze which
swept the stretch, stamping him as a very
promising colt. ' - . . .- - .] â¢
In the mile handicap Ventoro, about the
only starter whose price came down in the
betting, beat The Lady out by a narrow
margin. The Fretter opened favorite, but
it did not seem to be his day, for- after
getting cut off at the turn the chestnut
horse ceased to be a contender.. Ventoro
led throughout, just lasting long enough
to beat The Lady a neck. Constellator
ran a close third, his race being a marked
improvement over ; his run on Thursday.
Houston, the youngster who . piloted The
L*dy. cut half the field off at the tlrst
turn, for which action his mount was dis
qualified. â¢ This gave Advance Guard j the
show. -
Kingstelle, favorite for the two-year-old
dash, failed to get a mark. Driving hard,
Thorpe landed Bernota first, a length be
fore Intrepldo. Chaste, a 100 to 1 shot,
was "third. . .
With 15 to 1 against his chances Uni
versity made . a runaway race of the
hurdles handicap, reaching the wire ' six
lengths in front of . Durward. : Duke of
York, played down to favoritism, finished
in the show. Monlta fell just after taking
the last obstacle, and McKenna, his rider,
suffered a fracture of the. collar-bone. -;â¢
Al Shaw, on Twlnkler, lost the mile and
a half run by a nose to Chimura. The
latter mare at first ruled 'favorite, -but
Twinkler had the call at post time. . There
was no speed among the five starters,
compelling Shaw to cut out the running.
When challenged the last furlong by Ross,
on Chimura, Twinkler was outsprinted,
losing by - a nose. * The ' decision ' did : not
suit many, ; who seemed to . think â¢ Corri
gan's mare had been favored by; the
Judges, and . some hissing resulted. - To
those right over the wire, though, no mis
take seemed ' to have been made. ; "
Another heavily . backed Â¦ choice lost by
the narrowest of margins in the last num
ber. With his price forced down from
threes to 9 to 5 Catastrophe was nosed out
by P. Corrigan'a Racivan, a 6. to 1 chance.

ATHLETES DO GOOD WORK
ON THE BERKELEY OVAL
HOW DR. VOORSANGER WAS
TAUGHT A NEW LESSON
THE Rev. Dr. Jacob* Voorsanger haa
learned the wisdom of humility.
San Francisco does not boast a
more eloquent preacher or a more
learned clergyman than he. but he
can't box. There would be nothing
*t range or unusual in thai deficiency in
the manly art of Eelf-defÂ«iM> were it not
for the fact that the reverend gentleman
labored under a hallucination that he
r^uld box. Now he knows better, is minus
two front teeth and handles the gloves
mor* wisely and more humbly than be
fnre.
It all happrnM in this way. Dr. Voor
lar.Ff-r was getting Ftout. He had passed
the Interesting etage of the robust and
va? approaching thÂ«t Â«f the rotund. He
determined io call a halt in the progress
of flesh snd decided to take a severe
course In physical exercise and training
from Julian R. Brandon, a prominent local
instructor in the art. Under his guidance
Dr. Vooreanger advanced with rapid
? â¢rides. He lost twenty pounds in a sin
pie month, became an adept with the
gloves, knew all about upper and lower
FLEET GREYHOUNDS CHASE ELUSIVE HARES

the open stake at Irgliside
Coursing Park and the hounds
In consequence were given Eorae lons runs.
The last course of the day, that between.
Eylv&nus and Master Gordon, proved
rather exciting- and required the release
of three relief dogs before it was finished.

of the grand stand, making the excitement
more intense. Favorites as a rule ran true

SAN QUENTIN . PRISON, March 17.â
But little business of importance was
transacted at ihe monthly meeting of the
State Board of Prison Directors, held
here to-day, only three members, of the
board, Hayes, Wilkins and Ray, being
present. 7 . : :
The jute mill report shows that the de
mand for prison-made grain bags still con
tinues, and the output of the mill, which
turns'out 15,000 bags per day. Is sold up to
August 10. In connection with the -Jute
mill report Director WllMns remarked
that San Quentin was not getting its
proper quota of prisoners, there being,
owing to this, reventeen idle looms in the
jute mill. "If," said Director Wllklns,
"we were able to put men to work on
these looms the supply of bags would be
able to keep pace with the demand, and
the price per t>ag 'would be much lower,
thereby benefiting the farmers and as a
consequence the State." On motion of Di
rector Wllklns it was ordered that letters
be addressed to the Superior Judges of
San Francisco, Alameda and -the counties
south of Tehaehapi, all centers of crime,
petitioning them to commit all able-bodied
criminals to San Quentin. 'There are on
hand at the prison 1,441,000 grain bags,
while 416,000 hav^. been carried over â¢on
orders from last year. Since January I
2,813,130 grain bags have been sold, 6100
of which have already been shipped;
1,783,030 more bags will be required to fill
orders up to August 10. ? .
The credits of F. J. Ross, forfeited In an
attempt to escape, were ordered restored.
Ross is the Inventive genius who has sev
eral times improved and repaired the JutÂ»s
mill machinery, and has by his scheme
for repairing wornout "fliers" saved -the
State a large annual sum. Ross claims to
have discovered a chemical process by
which he can manufacture an expioslva
capable of wrecking the prison. A few
months ago he threatened the board and
penitentiary with annihilation if his cred
its be not restored. Ross is serving eight
years and two months from Merced .on
charges of burglary and grand larceny.
Fred Coleman, the man who thrashed 'a
fellow-prisoner for swindling 1 his aged
mother out of her hard won earnings on
pretext that her son was in ,,. need of
money, and thereby lost his credits, was
restored to favor, and will be able to cele
brate the Fourth of July, on which day
his term expires, In civilian's clothes.
Attorney George W. Jones, on behp.lf of
F. S. and Charles Markanion, two broth
ers serving nine <and .five year 3, re
spectively, for arson from Fresno, filed
letters with the board petitioning for the
parole of the two prisoners from several
prominent men, among them being Attor
ney General Tlrey L. Ford.: The two base
their application for paroles on their good
(Characters previous to the commission of
their crime. As the full board was not
present the question was laid over. The
petition for restoration of credits made by
"Rebel" George, the veteran .confidence
man, was denied. Pierre Cassajou. an
aced French convict, who has become
completely blind since his incarceration,
will by order of the board be operated
upon by Dr. Cornwall, the eye specialist,
who has consented to undertake this ense
at the request of Warden â¢ Aguirre. Dr.
Cornwall, on account of the penniless con
dition of the man, will perform the opera
tion for a nominal fee of $50, which sum
the beard voted for the purpose.

Directors of Pacific Association Dis
cuss Merits of Various Bay
Courses for Regattas. > '
â¢ At* the regular monthly meeting of the
board of managers of the Pacific Associa
tion, Amateur Athletic Union, held on
Friday evening, there was a good attend
ance. A handsome banner of blue silk
embroidered in gold -letters was: exhibited
to the directors. It is to be presented Xq
the University of California as a memorial
of Its victory in the intercollegiate football
match of 1899. ;."
. Much dlscussion"Â«ensued with regard to
the place at which the. association should
hold Its regattas. I It was pointed out that
El Campo is only available up. to April 1,
as on that day the picnic season,.com
mences and tne grounds are 'engaged
every Sunday. It wa9 further staged tnat
spectators who go over to El Campo dur
ing the summer season to witness a .re
xatta may fail to see one, as .the water is
likely, to be so rough as to render* rowing
races impossible. Other objections to the
El Campo course are the , difficulty or
measuring ithe distance accurately and
keeping correct time. On the other hand,
the North Pacific Railway has always
treated the , oarsmen ; fairly ; and has â¢ of
fered them considerable Â« encouragement.
President J.R. Bockman and Dr.'C. C.
Dennis are both strongly in favor of giv
ing Oakland Creek a trial, as there it is
possible to take accurate times and secure
at least moderately smooth water." To ren
der the course available it will.be*neces
sary to erect a dressing room for the
oarsmen, a grand stand for judges and
spectators and a shed : for houstng the
boats. It is not unlikely the first regatta
of the season will taTte place on the Oak
land Creek. A third place suggested is
the lagoon behind Tiburon, but to make
this available it will be necessary to
dredge it somewhat and to construct a
gate by which the tide water may.be kept
In. A suggestion was made that each
rovdn? club in the association should put
up a certain sum to purchase trophies,
which would be held by the clubs from
which the winning crews come. : â¢
leaps for life, trapeze and athletic per
formances and leaves; room for 1 a- bit of

a big display of trained animals. And all
this wÂ».. be under - ; thel guidance of a

is the fact that the I four gentlemen are

ELKS' GREEN TEA.
About four hundred of San Francisco's
prominent citizens gathered last night In
Elks* Hall in response to that number of
invitations extended by San Francisco
Eodge Xo. 3, Protective Benevolent Order
of Elks, to attend their green tea party.
This function was remarkable, for the
reason that no tea was served, but the
lack of this was made up by the serving
of an excellent collation and refreshments
by members of the order wearing . long
white aprons and green silk caps after the
pattern of those worn by chefs." At- 10
o'clock the fun commenced and continued
until the clock struck 11, when the lights
were turned low and there was drunk the

LEFT THE BODY OF AN
INFANT ON THE ROOF
Sensational ; Charges Are Made
Against the Matron of the
Foundlings' Home. '-- >.*{i '-
The nurses of the Foundling Home, on
Golden Gate avenue, appeared befors the
Board of Health yesterdayand complained
of the matron in charge of the home. Â¦ The
principal complaint was based* upon tho
manner in which she had treated the body
o# a deceased infant.
: It is customary for the attendants to
place the bodies of the dead, children -on
the roof of the home until the undertaker
calls for them. The nurses said the body
of the child in question was: left on" the
roof In the rain for several days, until it
finally became a nuisance. Then, by, the
matron's orders, so the nurses say, it wan
taken and placed among the soiled linen
of the establishment, and left there until
sortie one removed it. â¢
The nurses also complained that they
were being restrained .of their liberty.
Several of them went ; to the theater . aev
eral nights ago without the permission of
their superior. Later, the matron discov
ered the stubs- of thÂ« ; theater, tickets ' In

ANOTHER TRIUMPH OF
THE YELLOW SHEET
Reproduces a Story Which Was Pub
lished a Year Ago in ThÂ«
Call.
The local yellow sheet is at last learn
ing that It Is more profitable to print the
truth, even If it has to steal It and adorn
It with a fabric of lies of its own manu
facture. In the mendacious sheet yester
day there appeared a very pretty story
of the sudden rise to wealth of Miss Elsie
Tyson, a ( mald who lived in drudgery on
a Humboldt farm until a lawyer came
from across the world to tell her that she
was heiress to an enormous fortune. The
story was true, but it is a year old. It
was told and told better in The Call on
March 26. 1899. Shortly after the publi
cation Miss Tyson went with her attor
ney to Scotland and has not returned. The
Examiner, however, placed her in a mys
terious house In a mysterious street in
this city and made her say on Friday Just
what she said to a representative of The,
Call a year aeo.
There was absolutely nothing new In the
story nor excuse for its reproduction ex
cept to impose upon the public. It seems
unkind of the Examiner to keep Miss
Tyson locked up for a year waiting for her
money. Coupled with this unklndness,
however, is a generosity which is com
mendable. When Miss Tyson left here
she was heiress to J10.000.000. The Exam
iner was not satisfied with that sum, how
ever, and when It awoke yesterday to the
fact that a year ago a California girl had
left the State with a vision of J10.000.000
before her the yellow sheet fixed the sum
at J13.000.000. While the sheet deserves
praise for republlshlng the news it should
strive to keep nearer to the truth. .

ONE MORE LINE
TO STRIVE FOR
MEXICAN TRADE
New Vessels to Compete
With the Pacific Mail
Company.
Steamship and Railroad Corporation
Formed for the Purpose of Con
trolling Coast and Gulf
Business.
The latest gossip In railroad and eteam-
chip circles is speculation as to the per
sonality cf the men who are behind the
pigantie steamship and railroad scheme
that is being engineered to compete with
the Southern Pacific and the Pacific Mali
Steamship companies for the freight and
passenger traffic business of Lower Cali
fornia and Mexico.
The new line is to be known as the
Mexican National Steamship Company
and will be operated under an act of the
Mexican Congress.. The vessels of the
company will fly the Mexican flag, carry
Mexican marines g.nd in every way be un
der the laws governing Mexican vessels,
but while the Mexican acts as a cloak to
hide the real backers and financiers of the
enterprise, the scheme alms at nothing
less than a monopoly of all the business
selves In a magnificent display of eques
trian movements. The programmes have
exhausted Webster in adjective de?crip
tion of these pentlemen and their fearless
and artistic riding. The names, according
to the bills, speak for themselves. - Here
they are: J. F. Rooney. J. Cal Ewlnjj.

cf the ports bordering on the Gulf of Cali
fornia and to tap the territory tributary
to th# Colorado River.
The route of the new steamship com
pany will be from San Diego south to
Cape St. Lucas, thence up the Gulf of
California to Puerto Isabel at the mouth
of the Colorado River, where the steam
ers will connect with river boats running
down from Yuma and touching at all in
termediate points on that Inland water
way.
From Puerto Isabel the steamers will
run down the gulf as far south as Salinas
Cruz, where they will connect with the
Tehuantepec Railroad, which crosses the
isthmus and connects-with the Ward Line
steamers at Coatzacoalccs on the At
lantic seaboard.
Thus the passenger from San Diego to
New York will be enabled to make the
trip, via the Gulf of California on this
side and Porto Rico and Havana -on the
Atlantic side, without patronizing one of
the Huntingdon vessels or railroads. The
time in which it will take to land a pas
senger from San Diego in New York by
the new line will be from twenty-five to
twenty-six days, or about six days shorter
than the present running schedule of the
Pacific Mail route.
The first steamer of the new line will
leave San Diego on March 28. From fhea
on vessels will be added as the traffic de
mands, and it is expected that before fall
there will be six ships of the National
Mexican Steamship Company in full oper
ation. These vessels will be chosen with
reference to the trade they are destined
for. They will run from 1000 to 12S0 Â»ona
burden, and will be fitted with every
modern appliance that may conduce to the
comfort &nd safety of the passengers. The
rates for both n&ssenger and freight busi
ness will be much lower than those per
taining on any of the other coast lines,
as it is the Intention of the promoters of
the new company to make their play for
patronage on the cheapness as well as the
excellence of the service they offer.
In connction with the steamship com
pany is a contemplated railway Jine.
which will run two branches out of Yuma
through Mexican territory. One branch
will have its terminus at San Diega and
the other branch will run down along thÂ»
banks of the Colorado River to Puerto
Isabel, a distance of 145 miles, and from
there forty-eight miles along the gulf to
Georges Bay, where it will connect with
the ocean steamers. There will also be a
branch in American territory, runnine
from Yuma to Phoenix. Ariz.
The Fteamship company is already an
accomplished fact, and the final surveys
have been made for the road, and the
work of construction will commence a*

these parties have been organized, and the

There will be amusement for old and

Lee -Yot-Guln, the" Chinese woman In

Every possible effort to straighten out
the difficulty was made, but without avail.
The Consul General even offered to raise

ground rice put in boiling water and
boiled to a thin paste, a half-pound of
powdered Spanish whiting and a pound of

A CLIPPER SHIPâ I_B. 8.. City. A dip
per ship Is one that is built with a view
to speed at the sacrifice of carrying ca
pacity. It is a vessel built with very
sharp lines, more or less raking masts and
great spread of canvas with a view to
speed. It Is the development of a model
for the mercantile* marine, first built In
Baltimore Md., and called "Baltimore
clipper." In 1552 the following claim waa
made for the clipper by the compilers of
the "Annals of San Francisco": "The cl'p
per ship is virtually the creation of San
Francisco. The necessity of bearing mer
chandise as speedily as possible to so dis
tant a market, one that was so suddenly
overstocked by goods, forced merchant.*
and shipbuilders Interested In the Califor
nia trade to Invent new and superior mod
els of vessels. Hence the modern clipprr,
with her great length, sharp lines of en
trance and clearance and fiat bottom.
These magnificent â¢ vessels now perform
the longest regular voyages Q known in
commerce along both coasts of the Amer
icas in about four months, while the or
dinary ships of older models used to take
six and seven months to cover the pamÂ»
distance." The Cyrus Wakefleld and Tll
lle S. Starbuck are not classed as clip
pers.
THE DRAGON FESTIVALâ Enq.. City.
The dragon festival which the Chinese pro
pose to celebrate in this city in the early
part of June is celebrated In China during
the first five days of the fifth month, and
there It is known as the "Festival o* the
Dragon Boats." Early on the first day of
that month every householder nails a few
leaves of artemisa and of sweet flag eight
feet from the ground to expel noxious in
fluence and bad odors. Then follows tna
dragon boat races on the rivers and lakes.
The boats are about fifty feet long and
are shaped so aa to represent a dragon In
gaudy colors. 'as the Chinese understand
a dragon. The . festival has Its rise, ac
cording to legend, in an event that oc
curred about 3200 years ago. Kluh Yuen,
a high Minister in the time of the Chan
dynasty, proposed certain salutary re
forms to the Prince, who was his relative,
but was refused. He proposed again, but
was once more refused. Nothing daunted,
he made a third appeal, when he was again
refused and dismissed from tho service of
the Prince. Kluh Yuen, not wishing to
survive the ruin of his country, which. he
foresaw, plunged Into a river and was
drowned. His countrymen, among: w^iom
he was very popular, on learning of the
circumstances of his death traversed tnÂ»
river in all directions in the hope of re
covering his body. The boat race Is an
imaginary search for the body. On tha
other four days there Is a grand festival,
according to what the Chinese consider
grand, and about the middle of the fifth
day there are various superstitious and
Idolatrous performances in the houses of
each family, according to established
usage. . . >.\

The trolley ride by Bay City Parlor last
Wednesday night was a very pleasant af
fair that was attended by a large num

going over the electric lines the party
went to the ocean beach, where there
was dancing for more than two I hours; -
The charter members ol the Army and
Navy Parlor will meet in Native Sons'

Native Daughters.
Last Saturday night the Married La
dies' Club of La Estrella Parlor enter
tained the^slngle ladles of that bright sub
ordinate and one of the features that had
been announced was that "there should
be a man for every old maid of the par
lor." The fact that there were but two
men present is proof that there are but
two old maids in La Estrella, There was
a very enjoyable programme of instru
mental music and literary numbers, the
feature of the programme being a pa
thetic recitation by Miss Perron in a man
ner that demonstrated that the lady h,as
the power at will to move an audience
to tears. Little Baby Vincent charmed
with an exhibition of fancy dancing. Dur
ing the evening Laurance Vincent startled
the audience by igniting a large dish filled
with alcohol and raisins and 1 eating the
burning fruit. He then added a compound
to the liquid which changed the color of
the flame and that reflecting on the com
pany in the darkened room produced a
weird effect, for each face looked like that
of a corpse. This was followed by danc
ing and the serving of refreshments,
cakes and icecream. .
The members of San Lusita Parlor of
San Luis Obispo recently gave a bonbon
anniversary party, which was a great so
cial success, the large hall in which it
was given being crowded to its limit.
There was an excellent programme of va
ried selections, instrumental and musical,
and then a comedietta entitled "A Kiss in
the Dark," which was followed by danc
ing. The parlor is in a prosperous condi
tion and It has an active membership and
energetic officers.
. Darina Parlor gave another of its popu
lar "at homes" in Franklin Hall last Mon
day night and a most interesting . pro
gramme of entertainment was presented
by the social committee, of which Miss
Frances Edwards was the chairlady.' This
young lady decorated the hall with a pro
fusion of golden poppies, which she her
self collected in the vicinity of Inglesldo.
The banquet ball and the tables were also
decorated with these beautiful flowers.
There were present Past Grand President
Miss Mac B. Wilkins of Santa Cruz Par
lor and representatives of nearly all the
local parlors, who came to. admire the
beautiful girls of the Western Addition.
The members of this parlor are not only
entitled to be called beautiful, but they
arÂ£ entitled to be called most enjoyable
sisters of the order. After the programme
there was an adjournment to the banquet
hall, where an hour was pleasantly spent.
To-morrow night the parlor will initiate
two candidates, which will bring the
membership up to eighty.
Improved Order of Red Men.
The recent visit of the great chiefs to
Cosumnes Tribe. Sacramento, will long
be remembered by all who attended as a
most pleasant .one. This tribe, which has
the honor of several past great sachems,
is the home tribe of present Great Sachem
E. B. Wilson and of J . "W. Crone, the
great sannap. The visitors were met at
the train by a committee which escorted
them into the wigwam, where they were
received with that enthusiasm and good
fellowship that always characterizes the
Red Men of Sacramento. After the
quenching of the council fire there was an
adjournment to a banquet hall where
there was served up a feast of, corn and
venison, followed by responses to toasts
by the visiting chiefs, District Deputy O.
N. Cronkite. Past Sachem G. W. Whit
lock, Clarence Crouch of Winnebago Tribe
and Edward Close of Althomas Tribe.
Last week . Great Sachem Wilson and
Great Chief of Record* Bliss left this city
for the south for the purpose of institut
ing a tribe at Riverside and a council of
the Degree of Pocahontas at Los Ange
les. Since the previous visit to these
hunting grounds by the " great sachem
there has been a revival of activity in tho
order that, if kept up, will do much to
place the Red Men in a leading position in
the fraternities of Southern California.
They instituted Leola Council at Los An
geles with forty members and on Wednes
day they instituted Riverside, Tribe with
sixty charter members. The work of the
evening was by the team from Con hull a
Tribe of San Bernardino and the degree
work was excellent. The credit for the
perfection is due to Sachem Hanford, who,
Bince the institution of the tribe last No
vember, has worked very hard to make it
letter perfect.
The great sachem has appointed Past
Sachem V. V>'. Kewell of Bald Eagle dis
trict deputy great sachem for Seneca
Tribe, and Past Sachem H. O. B. Byer'ey
of Manhattan Tribe deputy for that tribe,
which is located ,ln San Jose.
Five new tribes are in process of organi
zation.
George F. Brackett, sachem- of Pohona
chee Tribe, will soon leave this city for a
visit to the East and Europe. He. has
taken a very active interest in the tribe.
AU who know him wls.h him a pleasant
and enjoyable trip and safe return.
Â¦ George N. Farren, past sachem of Cher
okee Tribe, reports the order as progress,
ing in Alameda County, and that he is at
work organizing a new tribe for Oakland.
Yosemlte Tribe is still advancing, and
at its next meeting it will have ten pale
faces to adopt. Those who at this time
are working industriously for the welfare
of the tribe are J. H. Olandt, W. Goldman.
Dr. J. J. Keefe, W. J. O'Connor Â»ni
George fit Stein.
The social to be given i.ext Tuesday
night by Kaweah Council in the Alcazar
building will be a tissue paper social, and

Hattie A. Trundle's t Bequest
Is Sued For by Her-
Heirs-at-Law.
. â¢ - â ? â â
Alleged Slanderous Statement Hade
by the Dead Millionaire's Wife
. Years Ago Will be In "
.vestigated.
By the death of Hattle A. Trundle the
bequest to her of $50,000 in the willof the
late Adolph Sutro "tor a great wrong done
her" will not merge "Into the -bulk of tho
estate, as was supposedâ at least not
without a legal struggle in which the best
known of the Sutro family skeletons will
be dragged forth and inspected for the
edification of the public and th-j gratifica
tion of the gossipsr Suit was tlle<i yester
day by John A. Drinkhouse, administrator
of Hattle Trundle's estate, ag-aiiisst Emma
L. Merritt and W. R. H. AdamJbn, execu
trix and executor of the will of thta late
Adolph Sutro, to force the payment of the
legacy in question. , ,'
In the complaint it Is averred that the
bequest was made by Sutro in lieu of
damages which had been Incurred by Hat
tie Trundle for abuse ahe had received at
the hands of Mrs. Sutro in Virginia City
In 1879 and for the slanderous statements
Mrs. Sutro Is said to have made regard
ing her at that time, j It is claimed in the
complaint that Sutro persuaded his lega
tee not to sue him for damages, on his
promise that he would say her as mud,
If not more, than she fi-ould.be able to
recover by a Judgment of court. This
promise was never fulfilled by Sutro in his
lifetime, but he ultimately kept his word
by bequeathing her $50,000 in his will.
Administrator Drinkhouse say* '.hat he
has never been able to collect the bequest
on behalf of Mrs. Trundle's heirs on ac
count of the objection made by Sutro's
children, but he believes that, the court
will compel the executors to obey the wish
expressed in the will of the deal million

cepted in Wall street. Much conflicting opin
ion continues to be offered from more or less
expert sources regarding the extent to which
bank circulation will be expanded under the
new law and as to its effect on prices and busi
ness. The ponvlctlcn is general that there will
be a liberal expansion of bank note issues and
that the effect on the money market will
promptly be felt to the extent of the 10 per
cent increase in the circulation of bonds at
present deposited to secure outstanding circula
tion and of the premium -n the same bonds,
payable upon their : conversion into the new 2
per cents. Assurance is felt that the payment
of this premium will be made out of the funds
in the Treasury, if necessary, to avoid dis
turbance in the money market, rather than by
drafts on deposits in national banks. But
even in the event of draft on those deposits,
It is evident that the Government bonds placed
by the banks with the United States Treasury
as security for these deposits will be thereby
released and made available as a basis for
additional circulation. The circular iseued by
the Treasury Department explaining the pro
visions of the new law clearly demonstrates a
margin of profit on circulation, even at the
present high prices ruling for Government
bonds, which is equivalent to upward ! of IW>
for the new twos, when issued. Ruling
prices for the bonds havÂ«vjiroved sufficiently at
tractive to bring larpe offering* from invest
ment holders, including savings banks," to
whom they are not available to take out cir
culation. The proceeds of these sales peeking
reinvestment have made an unusually active
market for high-grade railroad bonds and are
likely to continue to do co If prices do not
reach prohibitory figures. 'It has been argued
that the bank notes are likely to go quickly
out of circulation when the demand for hand
to hand use of currency fall* off and the flow
of money turns from the Interior toward New
Tork, owing to the fact that they cannot be
counted to make up the required reserve of
lawful meney egalnrt deposit liabilities, while
at the same time going to swell deposits. But
it must be remembered that even at times
when the net shipments of currency are large
ly In favor of New York, there continues a
large volume of shipments in response to in
terior demands. This In January and Feb
ruary of ISBS, while the net receipts of cur
rency from the interior by New Tork banks
amounted to J39.665,000, there were actual ship
ments of currency to the interior of $ 19. 474. 000.
This allows a margin for & process of sorting
and selection which would 'afford opportunity
for keeping the bank "notes out. These prom
ised benefits of the new law are the potent in
fluence in keeping the price of stocks firm, in
eplte of the Immediate exigencies ' of the
money market. -7 Â¦-Â¦." I â¢; â¢-
Funds are not available for large speculative
buying, but holders are unwilling to make con
cessions to sell. The result is dullness and
firmness. Confidence tn the business outlook
is unimpaired and is strengthened by the Feb
ruary foreign trade statement, showing both
the total volume of exports.And-Xha-exc&s of
exports over imports beyond all precedents for
that month. Events of the week Indicate that
a termination of the war in South Africa has
been brought measurably near and the resump
tion of the gold supply, from the South African
mines, whenever it shall be In any *ort as
sured, is bound to have a stimulating effect on
all the markets of tbc world.
The market for bonds has been more active
than that for stocks, for the reasons already
stated, and prices have advanced. Â¦-.â¢ Â¦ Â¦

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 17.â The stock market
.conUnued almost In professional hands to-day.
There were erratic fluctuations and active
rpeculation in Third-avenue over a range of
l*-4 pointa and Sugar continued to share with
that stock the largest amount of attention.
Tennessee Coal advanced t point* and gave
pympathetic etrenxth to other iron and Â«eel
FtoekJ On the action of the directors In plac
ing the common stock on the dividend list by
ordering a disbursement of the 2 per cent, after
providing for the claims of preferred stock
holders to accumulation of Â»everal years' divi
dends. There was a good market for Amer
ican, stocks In London and an early advance
!n sympathy here, but the weakness of the
local traction stocks and uneaslnet.* over the
bank statement caused a sagging market up to
the time Â«f the appearance of the statement,
when there came a emart rally. A sudden
"drop in Third-avenue to below 68 and renewed
weakness in the other traction stocks checked
the advance and eettled sentiment. But the
closing wa* fairly steady and showed net
gÂ»in* except in a few stocks. The bank state
ment was a surprise in many particulars.
Wsgers had be*n freely made that the surplus
would rÂ«? entirely wiped out. The- fact that
it was reduced tr> little more than half, there
fore had a fwntlmental effect against the bears.
But the surplus is so email In any event as to
leave DO ere** difference in the condition re
flected by the hank*. What was of special
Fit-nificance wes the loan contraction of $1L-
S'l 4Â«0 This can only mean that the process
'o* 'liquidation has commenced of the extensive
loans taken out by the banks here and else
where to buy Government bonds for the pur
rose of taking advantage of the new refund
ing law fhiefly from this cause the loans of
the New York Clearing-house banks were ex
panded from January 31 to March lft to no
Iras than $56,9 CÂ£.000. The large applications
malting to the Treasury. Department, for the
conversion of present bonds into new twos
give promise of prompt relief for the money
n^rkets by the disbursement of the premiums
on the old bonds. It is highly significant also
that the New York Sub-Treasury begins to re
flect the paynwit of pensions in its reduced
drain on the banks, thus promising relief from
the factor that has caused the most uneasiness
regarding the money .market. On these ac
counts the belief is held that to-day's state
ment marks the culmination of the decline In
the surplus retservee. The quotations made in
to-days money market were hardly more than
nominal as loans made on the Stock Exchange
on Friday afternoon carry over until Monday.
Not the least surprise in the bank statement
Vas the fact that, as a result of the first
t M k the new bank currency law is in opera
tion, there is an actual decrease recorded In
th* circulation of New York banks of $62,600.
Simulative sentiment In the stock market
has been suspended during the week between
a conviction that the new bank currency and
Oovernment bond refunding law was bound to
result in aa Invigorating flow into the veins of
the circulating medium and a doubt whether
the eeSctt would become operative soon
enough to counteract, the factors, constricting
xh- money supply in New York and threaten
ing a pinch in the immediate future. The con
tinued dullness of the demand for stocks dur
ing the latter part of the week has prompted
sorae throwing over of stocks by tired holders,
who had bought to discount the effect of the
new -law and were dUappolnted at the tardi
nm o! the effect In manifesting Itself. There
was some calling of loan* on account of the
diminishing reserves of cash by the banks and
some selling of stocks in consequence. But the
â¢elling seemed to be confined to professional
trader* in stock* and those of lesser !mi>ort
encc. Only part of the week s gain* were
lo*t and the general- lÂ«*el Â«f prices remains
somewhat higher. While speculation has been
quiescent, there has been investment buyinj.
e*i>ecially in the bond market, affording an ef
fective support to confidence in the intrinsic
value of securities, however they -may be af
fected by the immediate : exigencies of the
money market. The difficulty In the New
York money market JÂ« due to the continued
drain *>f rash Into the United States Sub-Treas
ury. This week It has amounted to $4,300.< M),
bringing the total for the three weeks lant past
to over $16,000,000. As the total surplus of
Government revenues for the month of March
thup far amounts only to between - six and
seven million dollars, it I* clear that there
have been liberal disbursements on Govern
ment account at other points than New. York.
But there It a continued demand, neverthe
less, f sotn Interior points on â¢ New * York for
currency. These evidences of an active de
mand for money, as well as the continued de
mand for loan* upon the . New ' York hanks,
really go to show the strength of the business

CHICAGO, March i7.â The opening in Wheat
was marked by. a good deal of activity - and
strength. Liverpool ehtfwed a good advance,
following the gain in prices here yesterday, but
the chief factor for the time being was the con

damage reports and a corresponding advance in
the price of Wheat. May opened at 67%@67Hc.

NEW YORK, March 17.â The Financier says:
'"The. associated banks of ' New Tork lost $6,
825,700 cash lait week, as the outcome of their
operatiens with the treasury and the Interior,
but .this; decrease,' instead of comlns alto
gether out of surplus reserve as has been the
case for a month or more past, was partially
made-up' by reduced reserve requirements,
traceable to lower deposits. The statement
was a ""Surprise, in -several respects, the calling
tn of $11,311, 400 of loans. furnishing an example
in this respect..' To what Influence the shrink
age'ln loans is due Is rather a difficult prob
lem to answer, but as more^than half the de
crease originated with one largre bank, through
which the twenty million Standard Oil divi
dend was paid. â¢it Is quite probable that the
Incident .named had more or less to do with
the change In the combined showing. The re
funding of bonds, involving as it does some
complicated operations, possibly figures In
the same connection. As a result of the outgo
of cash and trade expansion In loans, deposits
fell off $15,343,000. This of itself reduced re
serve requirements $3,625,750.
The excess funds In bank are now $2,686,425
above the 25 per cent limit, but the fact that
exchange at interior cities Is hardening fore
shadows net only a cessation of the flow . of
money from New Tork, but fresh accessions
to the local 'supply. The most interesting
problem Just now concerns the Issue of new
note' circulation. The only expansion looked
fcr here at present Is the 10 per cent extra
granted on existing amounts Â¦Â¦ outstanding.
Bankers expect that the new notes will trickle
into circulation slowly and not . come in a
flood, as has been predicted. .There is a preva
lent impression that a test of the" new law's
possibilities will not be afforded until the de
mands of the crop season are felt. . Corres
pondence with country Â¦ bankers Indicates a
movement toward additional circulation", .both
by old and new banks, but on the other hand
many conservative Institutions have improved
the_opportunlty to sell their old bonds at prices
that gave them as much profit as they would
have realized on circulation for one year or
more, according to prices paid for the bonds
originally.
London Market.
NEW TORK, March 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were busy to-day celebrat
ing St. Patrick's day. Otherwise they were idle,"
but the tone was hard on the reported collapse
of the Free State resistance. It Is hoped that
the Transvaalers will follow suit. .
The war loan was at 1 1-lSd premium. The
allotment is expected on Wednesday.
Â¦ Americans were very -quiet, but no moves
were upward. Paris strongly supported Tlntos
which rose one. Â»The bank bought , Â£30,000 cold
m bars, i Money was a shade easier.- Half of
the large amount due the bank was repaid.

POLICE ASKED TO
COMPOUND FELONY
Before Declaring Peace the Chinese
Want No Action Taken Regard
l Lv; Ing Recent Murders.
Ho Tow, the Chinese Consul, has taken
a peculiar stand regarding a declaration
of peace among the rival highbinder so
cieties and the result is that a settle
ment of the war Is further off than ever.
Chief Sullivan was notified Thursday
that the Consul and the Chinese Six Com
panies were to meet and satisfactorily
arrange for a suspension of hostilities.
Yesterday morning the Consul saw De
tective Kd Gibson and informed him that
before declaring peace the warring tonga
wanted the police to desist from search
ing for the men who committed the re
cent murders. Gibson notified Chief Sul
livan of the Consul's request and the
chief emphatically declined to be a party
to any such illegal proceedings. ; He in
structed Gibson to -Inform the Consul to
that effect and also that he was tired of
hearing of promises that meant nothing.
The idea of appointing four > Chinese de
tectives to co-operate with the police In
suppressing the . highbinders, so far as
the chief is concerned, is now a thing. of
the past.
The arrest of Lucy Pay on suspicion of
being implicated in the murders of Low
Son and Ton Quey on March 5 is looked
upon, as a trick to Â«ret him out of 1 the
way because he informed the - police of
the whereabouts of the men suspected of
committing other murders. He was'ar
rested on Information ; supplied by Wong
Sing, alias Wong Guey. who has been
recognized as a man released : from Fol
som penitentiary June 15 last, after serv
ing a sentence for assault to murder in
Lassan County. Tne police; are investi
gating the case and it is probable that
Lucy Poy .will be released from custody.
SCIENTISTS SEE
DANGER IN THE
SCAVENGER CART
Protest Against Carrying of
Garbage in Streets in
0
Bacteria of Many Contagious Dis
eases Conveyed by the Air.
Threats of Epidemic
Considered.
Professor Eisen of* the Academy of Sci
ences yesterday added his testimony to
that of others that the passage of uncov
ered scavenger carts through the streets
in business hours is fraught with danger
to the public health. Sputum, perspira
tion upon . clothes, disease germs from
houses where contagious diseases have
been harbored, the sweepings from sick
rooms â all go into the ash barrel and are
tossed upon the scavenger's load, to cir
culate by day through the thickest part
of the city. In all these substances pro
lific In bacteria Professor Eisen found
danger to the health of the people. ;
R. H. Freund, one of the best known
bacteriologists on the coast, said: "Tu
berculosis bacteria are conveyed in the
air. Sputum dried is still a danger. . Con
sumption may be occasioned by the trans
portation of dangerous matter uncovered
through the public streets. Old cloths
and handkerchiefs from sickrooms find
their way into the ash barrels. Outside of
hospitals disinfection is unsatisfactory.
Private persons hardly ever think of thor
ough disinfection. The sweepings of
houses and all decomposing matter con
tain disease. Naturally all sweepings of
houses get into the scavenger carts.'
Diphtheria, scarlet and other fevers may
be conveyed by the air. Any bacteriolo
gist will tell you that there is danger^Jn
the way the garbage of the city is trans
ported through the streets.- People, are
too lenient, too hazardous. The carts
should not be used when the streets are
throng.-Â»d." .
I Dr. Lane, founder of the Lane Hospital
and dean of the faculty of the Cooper
Medical College, said: "The carts should
be' covered "at all times when they are
moving through, the streets, so that' the
people may be protected. The proper time
to collect garbage is when there are the
fewest on the streets."
This was the sum of .what all persons
who were interviewed yesterday said
about the garbage collection = in , the city.

PROPERTY WRONGFULLY
SOLD TO THE STATE
Supervisors Powerless to Afford Re
lief, but the Controller Will Be
Appealed To. ' . -, -.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee is
experiencing considerable trouble with
taxpayers whose property . has been sold
to the State for nonpayment of taxes,
when in fact the owners are in possession
of the receipted tax bills for the same.
The error arises because the Tax Col
lector, .to whom the money was paid, has
through his deputies failed to enter the
amount as paid on the assessment roll.
This neglect has occurred under different
administrations and ia confined to no one
official, being simply a clerical error.
When the taxpayer discovers that his
property has been sold to the State the
practice has heretofore been for him to go
to the Auditor's office, where he redeems
the property -by paying the tax a second
time, in addition to certain penalties. This
is an injustice to the taxpayer, whose first
payment, through no fault of his, has not
been recorded. The taxpayer then peti
tions the Board of Supervisors for the re
turn of the cost of redemption, but the
Judiciary Committee Is powerless to rec
ommend such action, because there is no
fund out of which the money can be paid.
In all cases the committee has reported
that the petitioners must look for relief
to the Tax Collector in office at the- time
the taxes were originally paid. This would
necessitate an expense in many cases
greater than the amount involved.
Under the old law; when property was
sold wrongfully to individuals for non
payment of taxes when the owner had
actually paid the same, the matter was
remedied by a resolution passed by the
board directing the Tax Collector to can
cel the sale. It is suggested as a. way out
of the present difficulty, and it will be
brought to the attention of the Judiciary
Committee, that when a taxpayer has
discovered that his property had been sold
to the State and he holds a duly signed
tax receipt that he petition the board to
adopt a resoluticn calling the attention of
the State Controller to the facts, and the
latter, finding that the evidence submitted
Is conclusive, may order the cancellation
of the sale.

AUDITOR WELLS IS
FRIEND OF TEACHERS
He Will Follow State Law in Appor
tioning Funds for Payment of
Their Salaries.
It is regarded as almost- certain that
Auditor Wells will take the same position
as Superintendent of Schools Webster re
garding the estimate to be submitted to
the Board of Supervisors for the expenses
of maintenance of schools upon which the
next tax levy will be based. Mr. Webster
in preparing his figures will follow the
State law, whereby J1.090,000 will be avail
able for salaries of teachers and other em
ployes in, the School Department. The
Auditor holds that this position is tha cor
rect one as has been determined by a
court decision that the State law Is para
mount to city statutes. --*.
The Board of Education's Intention to
adhere strictly to the terms of the char
ter providing for the setting aside for
salaries of $28 for each pupilln dally at
tendance, which, at 37,000, will amount to
$1,036,000, is meeting with considerable un
favorable comment, as the deficit must
necessarily fall on the teachers. The
other salaries, including those of the four
School Directors, are statutory, and there
fore unassailable. . â¢ :
"You can quote me." said Auditor Wells
yesterday, "as saying that I for one will
oppose any action that will tend to rob
the teachers of one cent of their hard
earned money. . I shall base my estimate
on the actual needs of the department
based on last year's figures according to
State law. The greater part of the school
moneys come from the state and I shall
be guided accordingly, notwithstanding
the provisions of the charter."

SUSPECTED BURGLARS
PLACED UNDER ARREST
William Jacobson and John Durah
denwald in Trouble for Acting
Suspiciously.
Two man suspected of committing barsr
laries In tba Western Addition were ar
rested Friday night by Detectives Crock
ett and Reynolds on Geary and Gough
streets and locked tip In tha "tanks"
pending Investigation. Yesterday they
were shown to the various watches.
Crockett and Reynolds observed tha
two men lounging around a building on
the northeast corner of Geary and Gough
streets; and waited for developments. Ona
of the men went around to the yard and
the other remained In front on the look
out. Recent burglaries in the Western
Addition . have been done with tha aid of
a hatchet, and the detectives surmised
that the man In the yard was looking
for one. The cook happened to go to tha
rear and, seeing the man. asked him what
he wanted, and he replied that he thought
a friend of his was employed there. Just
then the detectives appeared and placed
the men under arrest. They gava various
reasons for being there and also various
names, but they were identified as Wil
liam Jacobson. a petty larceny thief, and
John Durehdenwald. a recent arrival
from Tacoma. They will probably gat off
with a charge of vagrancy.
