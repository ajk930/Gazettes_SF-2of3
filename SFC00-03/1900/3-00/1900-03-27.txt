Mr. Watklns agreed.
.Mayor Phelan then prepared : and ; sent
and warmth with .which the American doctors,
nurses 'and. attendants v> ere received tn South
Africa. ; .The stories of Internal dissensions on
the Maine are: quite unbaaed. Lady Randolph
Churchill antagonized no one. On the con
trary. It was owing to her tact that several
little threatened annoyances were ; avoided.
She wished the Maine .to stay at the seat of
warfare and I agreed with Ser. but It had been
arranged .by the British Â¦ authorities that she
was to* leave after the relief of Ladysmlth. and.
though, Lady Randolph Churchill believed this
action would diminish the ship's sphere of use
fulness, she was too good a disciplinarian and
diplomat to question the decision of the com
mander-in-chief. Another reason ' prompting
the sending of the Maine home 'Is that tnÂ«
troop ships returning are not well equipped to
take wounded soldiers. The British Govern
ment is behind our own Is this respect, for
while the hospital ships at Manila and In Cuba
were able to transfer to transports the wound
ed and remain on the scene of action, those In
South African waters must needs return them
selves with their human cargoes.
We were very fortunate on the Maine with
cases. - Only one. man died before I left, and I
believe none have died since.
Â¦ Perhaps our most remarkable case was that
of 'an officer 'of the Gordon Highlanders who
was shot clean through the brain and who
completely recovered on board the ship. Mauser
wounds in the Intestines, which. If made by
the Springfield or Remington, would sorely
have been fatal, healed without operation. I
had seen some similar cases In the Philippine-
Islands and avoided operations on such wounds
with comolste success, the Mauser woond be
ing so clean and small that It heals better
when left alone.
I saw no case of explosive bullets, j and I be
lieve that the reports that the. Boera are using
such bullets are greatly exaggerated. Â¦ Front
my experiences In Manila and South Africa I
believe It ts almost Impossible to distinguish
between the explosive bullet and that of thÂ«
ordinary Mauser when the latter Is fired at
point-blank range.
The Maine will return to South Africa
Infmediately after landing her wounded
here. ;'* '."Â¦'

of the British ts best explained In a dis
patch from ' Bloemfontein dated Sunday,
March 25." and published In- the second edi
tion of the Times to-day. It says;

prolonged halt at Bloemfontein. It is
necessary, that the effect of the proclama-
THE bubonic buncombe of Mayor Phelan, his .Board t of Health and his yellow associate, the Examiner, reached .
yesterday a climax and a rebuke. The outrage committed on this city by: this precious ; triumvirate , could no
longer be endured. Added to the dlstre^ brought upon: the people of San Francisco by dread of a terrible dis
ease came the terrible affliction of unwarranted and lying advertisement to ev<iry other city in the. Union. '
The merchants of San Francisco could no longer, tolerate the. criminal m!sreprese.*Ation and they- appeared yes
terday before Mayor Phelan ; to protest. They demanded U that i redress be given and at once. 'Â¦'". You have proclaimed
us," as one of them said, "as a community waving a yellow flag In a cave of death." . v
Mayor Phelan, as is his custom, was. conciliatory. 'He penned a telegram to ' forty American cities and declared'
that in San Francisco there is not a single case of bubonic plague, that there has not^beenVone for three weeks, that
there is not a suspicion or a fear of a case, and that there never was more. than the suspicion of a case. - - .
This telegram was sent to these forty cities as a measure of scant Justice. to San Francisco after, the commission of
an outrage that is without parallel in the history of the city. i . ':'Â¦Â¦'â¢ Â¦Â¦ *'â¢ ;
Mayor Phelan, truckling to the merchants, propitious to the Board of Health,' for whose actions he stands respon-"

GENEROUS TREATMENT V
OF REBELS IS URGED
LONDON. ~ March 27.â Spencer Wilkin
son In the Morning Post to-day warns the
public against blinding themselves to 'the
magnitude of the task which has -yet to
be performed in; South Africa. He the^
refers to the fact/that an Immense dis
tance has to be traversed and points out
that only the smaller portion of the Free
State has yet been touched by the British
advance.' He continues; â¢
'It 'is quite possible that the Boers may be
able to prolonc the campaign for several
months, and the British advance, thousrh It
must ha\ - e a crushing effect, can.be carried on
only ty the persistent exertions of those In
the a>ld and those at home.
Another task which doÂ»s not appear to rrow
easier on nearer acquaintance Is the (settlement
of the districts disturbed by * rebellion. The
pacification of these must be difficult, owing
to t*elr vast extent. Little can be done until
Sir Alfred Milner Is authorized to announce the
Government's decision as to how rebels should
be treated and as tc how loyal colonists are to
be compensated for loeses.
â¢ There should be. of course, no policy : of re
venge, nor will the Government forget that Us
first duty, to itself is to vindicate Its-author
ity. The sooner these decisions are announced
the sooner, will the trouble diminish.
Winston Churchill, in a dispatch- this
morning from Cape Town, urges a gener
ous and forgiving policy toward the rebei3
instead of yielding to the demands of the
loyalists for severe treatment."-',' He < says:

not take this action voluntarily. He was

FRANKFORT. March 26.â The most
thrilling event of the examining
trial of Republican Secretary of
State Caleb Powers occurred this
afternoon shortly after 3 o'clock
and for a few minutes it looked as though
Furious trouble could not be prevented.
Judpe Georpe Denny, for the defendant,
in an argument upon the competency of
a question said:
"It is perfectly lawful for people to
come here and to come armed. I came
here several times myself."
He was referring to the crowd that was
present at the mass-meeting held in the
fitate House yard Just prior to Governor
Goebel's assassination. *
Colonel Campbell for the prosecution re
plied that he did not consider it lawful
and was surprised to know that Mr.
Denny had come here armed. Denny de
nied having made such a statement and
said that he did not come armed. Camp
bell insisted that hÂ» had made thÂ« state
ment. Both men were very much excited
and epoke with vehemence, and with arms
Fhaking commenced to advance toward
one another. The courtroom was crowded
and the spectators evidently thought a
fight was on and made a mad rush for
the doors and windows, falling over one
another in their wild efforts to get out
of the room. Several policemen and
deputy sheriffs were crying for order and
Judge Moore was bringing his gavel down
with terrific force and urging the people
to take their seats. After five or ten
minutes of the most exciting scenes since
the assassination quiet was restored.
Just as soon as the room began to grow
orderly ex-Governor urown, one of the
attorneys for the defense, whispered to
Colonel Campbell, who promptly arose
Bnd apologized to Denny and the court.
Judge Denny replying In a very happy
tpeech. On an inspection of the record it
was found that Colonel Campbell had mis
construed Judge Denny's statement.
Mrs. Golden Not Called.
At the conclusion of the examination of
Golden th<? commonwealth rested its case.
It was stated last night that Mrs. Golden
â¢would also be introduced as a witness.
but she was not put on the stand. It is
eald that she was an unwilling witness.
The attorneys for the defense asked for
en adjournment of court at 4 o'clock for
the purpose of a conference with the de
fendant as to the witnesses that will be
placed on the stand in "his behalf to-mor
row. The court adjourned for this pur
pose.
When court convened at 1 o'clock Gol
den was immediately placed on the stand
and the cross-examination commenced,
â¢with ex-Governor Brown Interrogating
the witness. Golden said- he learned about
two weeks ago that he would be arrested
Jf he did not tell what he knew about the
assassination, while, if he did tell, the
attorneys for the commonwealth would
try to save him from prosecution.
Thomas B. Cromwell, who swore out the
warrant against Powers, was the first
person be talked to about the assassina
tion. Cromwell had been to the moun
tains and heard that he was connected
In some way with the murder and sent
for him. Golden told Powers of his con
versation with Cromwell, and -that he
wanted to get away from the State
House. He got a leave of absence from
Republican Assistant Adjutant General
Jones and left.
Golden said he told Judge Fleming of
Wisconsin that he intended to tell all he
knew about the affair. While he was in
Winchester, he eaid. he was stopped by
two menâ Dr. Foster and William Stelleâ
who grabbed him by the arms and cursed
him for exposing the Republican party.
Golden replied that he had not exposed
the party.-
Governor Brown asked him If he had
not told the two* men that he knew noth
ing about the affair. Golden said he
might have told them that, as he would
have said anything they wanted him to.
Governor Brown asked him if he made
a habit of saj-lng anything a person de
e!red him to, to which the witness re
sponded:
"Not when I am on equal terms with
him."
Colonel Campbell, for the prosecution,
objected to the way Governor Brown was
questioning the witness. While the ques
tion was being "argued, Golden asked to
be excused for a few minutes, as he said
be was growing weak, and he was taken
out of the courtroom by a Deputy Sheriff.
Powers Denounced the Shooting.
Golden resumed testifying a little after
2 o'clock. He could not remember that
he ever heard Powers say that he in
tended to harm any one. , Dick Coombs,
the alleged assassin, was brought to
Frankfort, he said, by William Culton.
one of the defendants. "Culton told Jbim
that he had brought Coombs down.
The witness said that when he had
beard on his way to LoulsvJUe with Pow
ers that Governor Goebel had been shot,
he told Powers what had happened, and
Powers said that It was a dirty shame
and outrage.
When asked about the man who was
LONDON. March 27.â A j strong | col
umn is now moving on Griquatown,
whence", after scattering the Boer
force at that place, it .will advance
to the relief Â¦of Maf eking. i
Reports that the Boers are abandoning
Kroonstad are . regarded generally as
false. Many here also -hesitate to believe
the stories of sudden-, violent, quarreling
between the allies. In the view of the
Globe's expert all the Transvaalers and a
considerable minority, of Orange Free
Staters show every sign of an intention to
make the coming military operations of
the British army as difficult as possible.
It would seem that the Boers are ac
tively Intrenching at- Kroonstad and pre
paring to make a stand there in the hopC
that Roberts will ,â¢ attempt a frontal at
tack. Their problem 13 a difficult one. If
they do not make a stand there for bat
tle they virtually abandon the whole of
Orange Free : State. ' If they offer resis
tance in force they. run serious risk, since
Lord Roberts has now fully ten thousand
mounted men to use in a flanking or turn
ing movement, while he has at least twen-'
ty-flve thousand infantry to spare for a
direct attack. , ;
The Boers In Natal appear.to.be falling
back from Biggarsberg Range to Laings
Nek. It Is a question whether there are
more than ten thousand burghers in Natal
at present. The main force of the repub
lics seems to be concentrated at Kroon
stad. where reinforcements from -the
north have arrived. Â¦_**Â¦ _\ âÂ¦
It is not likely that General Buller will
attempt to make a move until Lord Rob
erts Is ready. Any advance In Natal will
be a sign that the commander-in-chief is
again prepared to move.
The pacification of the southern half of
the Free State Is evidently not yet com
plete. Some of .the dispatches from Eng
lish correspondents indicate that when
General' Pole-Carew and the Guards went
down the railway to Springfontein . and
met Gatacre. farmers close to the .rail
way-submitted-and gave up their arms,
but that on either side of this belt there
were great tracts of territory where Brit
ish rule is not yet acknowledged. "

; Hanna, who Is chairman of the National
Republican Committee, rose to a Question
of personal privilege. He directed the at
tention of the members to an 'article pub
lished in a Washington newspaper to the
effect that a member of the; House of
Representatives had said to a representa
tive of the paper \ that the Porto Rlcan
tariff bill had been agreed upon as a part
of a "deal" by which the Republican party
was to receive a large campaign .contri
bution. Â¦ , " â¢'.â¢ ":';Â¦' :
"I don't believe,", said Hanna, "that any
Republican member of the House of Rep
resentatives ever made the statement at
tributed to him." . v ..'Â¦
He said the statement carried on its face
evidence that it. was false and added:. *
"I hope : measures will be taken to in
vestigate this statement. I brand it as a
malicious lie."- Â¦ â¢ ; -.
A resolution offered last Saturday by.
Allen of Nebraska was taken up. It called
upon the Secretary of: War for the num
ber of soldiers who have been' killed or
have died of wounds ? in . the Philippines
since August 1, 1898; the number who have
died of diease; the number, who have been
wounded; the number who have commit
ted suicide, and all other similar informa
tion in possession of the War Department.
In order that- the resolution might be
amended, it was, on his motion, referred
to the Committee on- Military Affairs.
; * Alaska Bill Taken Up.
The Alaska civil code bill was then
taken up. Perkins proposed a , long
amendment ; to the measure, - providing
for licenses in various amounts to be
assessed upon nearly all lines of business
and trade. ! Among the amounts assessed
arc the following, the Â¦ sum being the an
nual collection: ' â¢ \
Abstract offices, $50; banks, $250; brok
ers, |10O; â¢ breweries, $250; bottling works,
$200; drug stores, $50; electric light plants,
$300; gas plants, $300; jewelers, $25; itiner
ant physicians, $50. All transportation
and manufacturing companies and almost
every line of business are required to pay
a license. - The amendment was discussed
.by Perkins, Galllnger and Shoup. Dur
ing the discussion it. was developed that
since a license system of regulating the
liquor traffic had - been adopted by Con
gress for Alaska, there was only about
one-fourth the number of saloons In ex
istence as when Alaska was under a
prohibition law. Moreover, smuggling of
liquor into the district, it was stated,
practically had ceased. The amendment
was agreed to- .
Â¦ Hansbrough proposed the following
amendment as a substitute for section 73
of -the Alaskan bill:
V Aliens shall not be permitted to locate, hold
or convey mining claims in said district of
Alaska, nor shall any title to a mining
claim acquired by location or purchase through
an alien be legal. In any civil action, suit or
proceeding to recover the possession 01 a mln
lne claim pr for the appointment of a receiver
or for, an injunction to . restrain the working
and operation of a mining claim. It shall be the
duty. ot. the court to inquire into and determine
the question of the citizenship of the locator. -
In explanation of his amendment Hans r
brough said, that in the Cape Nome dis
trict many mining claims had been lo
cated by a party of Laplanders who had
been 9 sent north by . the United States
Government In charge of a herd of rein
deer: -The expedition had been,, sent to re
lieve some whalers who were supposed
to be suffering for food near Point Bar
row. Having the advantage of the rein
deer the Laplanders " made fast time Â¦ and
reached the - Cape Nome district In ad
vance of the American miners. They
promptly i located the best of the claims
and to. this day hold; them to the disad
vantage ,of â¢ American miners.
As a substitute for' the pending amend
ment Morgan offered the following, which
he thought would meet, any objections
likely to be urged against j the pending
amendment:
The rlEhts and privileges of mining for gold
in Alaska shall be extended to the subjects of
Great Britain and Russia on the sa/ne terms
and conditions that are cranted by said Gov
ernments, respectively, to the citizens of the
United States In the provinces or departments
of eald Government that border on the Arctic?
Ocean or Behrlnff v Sea. v- . . : '.Â¦
The amendments were pending when the
Senate, at 3:20 p. m.; had a brief executive
session and at 3:40 p. m. adjourned. .

PREAGHER-EDITOR SHELDON
SCORED BY JOHN J. INGALLS
PREACHERS OF
SAM JOSE OUT
FOR REFORM
Decide to Enter the Political
Arena and Down the
Bosses.
After a Spirited Debate the Mem
bers of the Pastors' Union Agree
to Support the Citizens'
Ticket.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. March 26.â The Pastors'
tnion will take an active part In the city
campaign. This was the unanimous senti
ment expressed at a largely attended
meeting of that organization this morn
ing, when all virtually agreed to work in
the interest of the citizens' ticket. These
are the nominations: Mayor, Harry J.
Edwards; Clerk, \V. J. Dougherty; Treas
urer, William Fischer; CouncilmenâSec
ond Ward, Byron Millard; Third Ward,
Tobe Lord.
The meeting of the Pastors' Union had
been set apart for the discussion of poli
tics, and about tweny-five prominent min
isters of the city were present.
Rev. H. Melville Tenney of the Congre
gational Church opened the meeting. He
stated that the citizens' movement in the
interest of better government was not a
partisan one. but was made up of all par
ties and creeds. It was not for temper
ance nor in the jnterest of any particular
cause, but was to free the city from the
evils that exist in municipal affairs as con
trolled by the political manipulators who <
have so long dominated the city govern
ment. The city schools were cited as an
example of what boss rule was doing.
Political bosses, and not the Board of
Education, declared Itev. Tenney, are giv
ing out the p'/sitions to the teachers, and
that patronage is used to pay political
debts and to maintain the politicians' hold
on citizens who are friends of the teach
ers. If. a janitor is appointed, he said, one
of the two political bosses must be seen â
lit a or Mackenzie â and he understood that
the latter now had the largest pofTer.
Teachers seeking positions from the Trus
tees' had time and time again been told
they must see Jim Rea before they could
be given any encouragement.
Mr. Tenney paid his attention to the po
lice. He said they obeyed Rea's orders
Implicitly. In closing be said:
"Under the present administration dur
ing the golden jubilee gambling was run
ning full blast on our streets, and the side
entrances of saloons were harboring lewd
women and everything evil. When re-
Fpectable citizens approached the police
and asked them to stop gambling they
said they had orders not to interfere. I
pay, hold the Mayor responsible for this.
You don't want to re-elect any man who
will debauch the community In such a
manner. Since I have become active in
this movement looking to the betterment
of the city attempts nave been made to
get my congregation to demand my res
ignation. I believe In thorough organiza
tion to bring these reforms about. You
can't play at Sunday school politics, but
must organize on common sense principles
. and fight the devil with weapons that will
beat him."
Rev. Dr. Maclaren of the Second Pres
byterian Church followed. He sanctioned
everything Mr. Tenney had said. Politics
had entered the schools and hurt them.
When he had made the High School trou
bles his text of a sermon the politicians
were greatly i>ut out. Rea met him on
the street one day and told him that un
less he refrained from attacking the
schools he (Rea) would head a party to
tar and feather him. Mr. Maclaren said
he told the irate boss if he and his gang
who came to help him would only give
him a few minutes' notice, so he could
sound the bells of his church he would
have enough helpers so that he (Maclaren)
could treat Rea and his followers to a tar
and feathering. â¢
Rev. F. S. Young. F. B. Sapp, Dr. Scud
<3er and others followed. They all said
they would do their utmost to advance the
interest nt the citizens' ticket and against
a continuance of the corrupt politics that
have existed here for years.

Jlt was expected_'.by several Supervisors
at yesterday's meeting that; a recommen
dation allowing . the Health , Board $7500
wherewith to cover CJrfnatown wi^h chlor
ide \of | lime \ and other germ destroyers
would be introduced. Though nothing has
ever been given " out regarding the recent
conference, at which the Mayor; Dr. Wil
liamson and | the members of the Finance
Committee were' present, it Is understood
that it was tacitly agreed to allow the
Health Board additional funds. - ;
Supervisors McCarthy and Heed were on
the Â¦ alert to ;blo<jk any such action. Each
was primed .with a lot of facts and figures
by which , to expose the little game. The
matter,*;, however,' was not : brought ! up,'
probably owing to the fact that opposition
was j scented. In discussing * the matter
Reed said: 'i--* r . -- .
- "This contemplated move to give the
Health Board , more Â¦ money is ' downright
robbery. â¢We 'Â¦ have given -it $24,000, . and
they are assuming obligations which they
have' no legal Â¦ rights to Â¦ do. ' Neither'the
Mayor nor any single member of the board
has any right to guarantee the furnishing
of more. money to be squandered. at will."
"If the i Health Department .was accom
plishing 'anything,'.'- said Supervisor Mc-
Carthy, '?H would not be so bad, but I fail
to see ; any substantial results in the em
ployment of so many inspectors. I was in
Chinatown from, 10 o'clock until 12:30 last
Saturday morning, 1 and out of that army
of employes I saw exactly four men work
ing.": One . was driving a- two-horse Â¦ team
while two others were scattering chloride
of lime . on \ the. streets. : ; The fourth was
tending i the burning of the : garbage | heap.
There may have been others inside of the
buildings, but, of i course,- 1 could not see
them. Â¦-:* I think * though that eight â¢ men
would be a sufficient force to scatter dis
infectants. According , to section 3028 of
the Political Code the expense of abating
a nuisance in -buildings is a Hen ,on * the
property,* and should entail no expense on
the city. - This plague scare J9 l sheer non
sense. Why. during the epidemic in ! Can
ton," where 30,000 Â¦ Chinamen died, not one
of the 300 white residents was afflicted."

QHICAGO, March 26.â J. C. Johnson,

opinion of articles published to-day in

I have read tbe articles in Question and am

unfair, and are only a sample of very. many
Hlmilar articles which have been and prob
ably will be published in papers with whose
managers the wish is very probably father to
the thought If -these articles are read with
care it will be seen that while they shrewdly
connect various men. Including : General
Weaver, with the proposed movement, there
is in reality not a word of authority for the
proposition ,in the articles from beginning to
end from . any of the members whose names
appear therein. So far as Senator Jones. 1 , Mr.
Walsh. Mr. Abbott or myself rare concerned,
none of us has ever had a thought or uttered
a syllable which would warrant the suggestions

metrically opposed to the Â« position in which

It is said that the danger of annoyance to

by the fact of the enemy breaking up Into

exercised In dealing with persons appa

ATTACKS IDAHO
LABOR UNIONS
Says Their Real Policy
Is Dominated by
Strong Statements Made by the Chief
Executive of the State Testify
ing in the Coeur d'Alene â¢
Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â Governor
Bteunenberg's cross-examination 'con
tinued to-day in the Coeur d'Alene Inves
tigation before the House Committee on
Military Affairs. Representative Sulzer
of New York directed the cross-examina
tion, Inquiring how the Governor Justified
the continuance of martial law. .V Vi
The witness said there had been a con
tinuous state of rebellion in - the Coeur
d'Alene districts, and while it did not take
the form of armed resistance, there was
at all times opposition to the policy of the
State authorities, an effort to thwart
them and to bring a renewal of th* old
condition of affairs. .
Sulzer pressed for a specification of
names and events in this disorder, but the
i Governor said it was general in character
and specific outbreaks were not likely to
occur while the authorities continued to
act with firmness. The Governor said he
was not in favor of solitary confinement
of prisoners â¢ unless they were i guilty Â¦Â¦ of
some infraction of prison [ rules. If such
Imprisonment had occurred, he 'said, he
was responsible for It, although he did
not favor It except on the conditions
stated. - .- ; . . Â¦ ' :Â¦-:-Â¦Â¦
W hen asked If he had conferred wfth
the Bunker Hill mine officials and others,
with a view to breaking up the. labor or
ganizations, the. Governor. said he had not.
He added that. In his Judgment.- the labor
organizations in Shoshone existed only in
name, their real policy being "dominated
by criminals." / Â¦: :. : .-. .
When asked to specify the . so-called
criminals, the Governor said he did . not
care to give names. - Governor Steunen
berg was asked why he did not' resort to
the posse comitatus, calling on citizens
to- aid the Sheriff â¢In â¢ maintaining > order.'
He said I he . did not I believe the ordinary
procedure was - sufficient to deal with the
situation.-- He : was confronted with- the
crisis, he-said, and he acted to the best
of his ability and Judgment to: meet the
crisis, although" it was -.- possible, he ~ an
swered Sulzer,' that he might have erred
Representative Cox of Tennessee asked
the Governor why. he did not call the citi
zens of adjoining counties to. his assist
ance... Governor Steunenberg replied that
he had a far better, way â to secure Fed
eral aid in the absence of the State troops
In the Philippines. Citizens, if called out
would have gone to the scene in a disor
ganized state. * He denied Â¦ that â¢ this was
a reflection on I the citizens, ' and \ said it
was his choice as the best remady avail
able.* . ;Â¦ ---Â¦/Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦:Â¦/-..-:;Â¦Â¦-- Â¦ ,
Besents Insinuations.
When Cox asked why: the Governor did
not send the Lieutenant Governor to rep
resent him at ' Coeur d'Alene, instead of
'.'that fellow Sinclair," Governor, Steunen
berg took exception j to ; the characteriza
tion . of . Sinclair. ? Cox explained i that this
was merely an' lnsinuation, to which the
Governor replied that he was not answer
ing Insinuations. He had not chosen the
Lieutenant Governor, to act,, he said,-be
cause; he "(the; Governor), -and t;not -the
Lieutenant Governor,' was the responsible
officer." and he chose Sinclair on his. own
responsibility: l^jgggMÃat>Sa^Bj^teÂ»>aÃiaat

these fisheries and laws governing
them on the same plane as those In

Mr. Bryan spoke of President McKin

ing army from 25,000 to 100,000 men, and
said he* had imperialism in view when he
made It, inasmuch as there: was then no
rebellion in the Philippines. While a
standing army of 25.000 men had been suf
ficient for 70,000,000 people who governed
themselves, it was estimated that an army
of 75,000 would be necessary to hold In sub

governed without their consent, j

The Republican party sprang into ex

Mrs. Sarah Kellogg has not obtained a
share of Mark Hopkins' millions she made
a find in California, where the foundation
of his fortune was laid, that is far rnoro
precious to her than gold. She welcomed
home to-day her son. V. KellogST. who had
been absent for almost thirty-five years.
No information about him had come to
his family until a month ago. when ha
was located in Fort - Jones. Cal. . Hia
"mother at once communicated with him.
He replied that he was willing to return
home, but although he had a sold mina
he had no capital with which to work 't
or even to purchase a ticket. Mrs. Kel
logs telegraphed a ticket and some money
to her son and the two met to-day In her
home, 303 East Onondaga street.
Mr. and Mrs. Kellogg lived in Fayette
ville at the outbreak of the Civil War.
The boy at that time was 14 years old. Ha
ran away ficm home when 17. came to
Syracuse and enlisted in the army. At
the close of the war he went West and
for a long time had been given up as
dead.
Mr. Kellogg, the father, was a cousin of
Miss Kellogg, who married Mark â¢ Hop

Senate Republicans Give Up
the Attempt to Reach
an Agreement.
FREE TRADERS OBDURATE
It Is IV-lded Not to Separate the
Tarin Feature and the Har
mony Committee Is
Discharged.
WASHINGTON. March 26.â The
Republican members of the
Senate spent two and a half
hours in caucus to-day In an
effort to reach an agreement
upon the Porto Rican legislation now
pending in the Senate. The caucus was
apparently, however, without material re
sult, the only accomplishment being a de
cision to proceed with the general bill as
it now stands, without separating the
tariff feature, and to discharge the har
mony committee from further efforts.
During the sitting, the free traders on
the one hand and the Iron-bound tariff
men on the other were quite as obdurate
es they had been at the previous meeting.
This condition of affairs was made so
manifest that Senator Allison, acting as
chairman of the caucus, declared at the
close of the meeting that there was no
necessity for putting a motion to continue
on past lines, as It was very evident that
no other course was practicable.
Senator Foraker was Instructed by the
caucus to press the Porto Rican bill as it
now stood, the governmental bill incor
porated with the tariff measure, to as
Epeedy a vote as possible. The under
standing- at the tlnfe this Instruction was
given was that Senator Foraker would
offer an amendment to the tariff feature
of the bill, adding the free Hat named by
the President in an executive order to
the exports going from the United States
to Porto Rico duty free, but that the 15
per cent of the Dingiey law carried in
the House bill upon goods coming from
Porto Rico to the United States would be
retained.
Many Senators Opposed.
There are a number of Senators who
Â¦will oppose the bill, even with the amend
ment recommended. They afe, it Is stat
ed. Senators Davis, Be-veridge, Hoar, Wel
lington. Mason, Simon. Proctor and Nel
son. It is also said that Senator Kyle,
who heretofore has acted with the Re
publicans, and Senator McCumber of
North Dakota will not vote for the House
bill unamended, but It is believed that
they will vote for the amended proposi
tion.
Two Senators named In the list of the
eight as given are claimed by friends of
the tariff measure as almost sure to vote
for the amended bill, leaving six Repub
licans who will vote finally against the
measure. It is claimed that two or three
votes will be secured for the tariff meas
ure from the ranks of the opposition par
ties in the Senate, and that in this way
a majority will be secured. "While there
has been a great deal of discussion among
Senators as to what the House will do
when the amended bill is sent over there.
the only result has been a decision that
the Senate must act as seems best under
the circumstances, and the bill If it
passed must take its chances in the
House.

While much evidence on this point will
be taken here, the greatest amount of tes
timony will next week be developed at
the San Francisco session. The commis
sion also Is expected to thoroughly can
vass the citrus fruit question in its as
pects of routing rights and private car
line abuses. The opposing companies and
fruit men are prepared to make a vigorous'
fight for their respective. interests. It is
said 'that the real object of the filing of
complaints before the commission by the
fruit men is to secure an annulment of the
contracts between the railroads and the
car lines, that still have two years to run.
The shippers will hold that the contracts
are void.
The California State Railway Commis
sion will sit as an act of courtesy with the
Interstate Commissioners, but the State
Commissioners will have no jurisdiction In
the cases to be heard. Commissioner
Blackstock of Ventura is in the city and
Commissioners Edsoh and Laumeister are
expected to arrive to-morrow morning. -
When the State Railway Commissioners
return to San Francisco they will hold a
meeting toiconsider the recent raising of
the Southern Pacific's San Joaquin Valley

ON Friday evening next the Colum
bia AthleUc Club will hold another
of its boxing exhibitions in Wood
ward's Pavilion. "Soldier" Phil
Green Is scheduled to box twenty
rounds with Professor Willard Bean, the
versatile Utah pugilist. Aside from
the fact that the latter has met and
shown well against such men as Choynskl,
Williams, "Paddy" Purtell and others.
Bean will be a great drawing card be
cause of his interesting history. He is a
boxer, preacher of the gospel, actor,
teacher of physical culture and many oth
er things. He relies wholly upon his two
big "mits," however, to earn him his live
lihood, and those who have seen him "go"
while in training are greatly impressed
with his ability. He will surely make it
interesting for "Soldier" Green. Bean has
trained since his arrival at Blanken's Six-
Mile House and is now in splendid condi
tion. Green has prepared himself at Croll's
Gardens, Alameda, and Is reported to be
in better condition than he has been in
any previous battle.
Preliminary to the main bout Jimmy
Lawlor and "Jack" Kane, twajwell-known
local men. will box twenty rounds at 135
pounds. As great interest attaches to the
latter bout as there is in the battle be
tween Bean and Green. This will be their
second meeting and will decide who is the
better man. Lawlor gained a decision over.
Kane after twenty rounds of stiff fight
ing a month ago, and as the decision was
a close one the club managers decided to
match them over again. Both men have
trained hard for their bout and are in fine
fettle.
As a curtain raiser "Kid" Dobson. bet
ter known as "The Alligator," because he
moves around like the reptile, is to box
eight rounds with "Mike" Walsh, the
"Tipperary Slasher." Wool is likely to fly
when the colored man and the native of
the old sod some together, and ring fol
lowers anticipate a hearty laugh..

pace was only a warming up trial, with

drew up on equal terms. She did not give
up without an effort, but the colt proved
more than her equal, winning cleverly the
last few yards in 1:53 V&, an excellent per
formance. Zoroaster was third. "
Walter Jennings, trainer of Andrisa,
appeared nettled over the filly's defeat
and offered to match her against the win
ner under the same conditions for $500 a

will meet on Tuesday of next week, the

FLAT RACING
SEASON OPENS
IN ENGLAND
- Â»
Sloan, Martin and the Two
Reiffs to Have Many
Mounts.
Presence of the American Jockeys
Lends Interest to the Meet and
Their Performances Are
~. s , Closely Watched.
LONDON,' March 26.â ThÂ« flat racing
season opened to-day jat i Lincoln. â¢â The
weather was cold. \ The presence of Sloan.
Martin and the two Relff s, Lester and
Johnny, and the fact that they were en
gaged for most of -the races of the meet
ing and were to ride promising sprinters
added . interest and. gave international
flavor, to the sport. -
The first ' race of the . meeting was the
Trial plate and was secured by Johnny
Relff In somewhat hollow fashion, his
mount winning by three lengths. The
horse ridden by his brother Lester fin
ished third. The result In detail was:
W. T. Robinson's Portiers, three years
old, won; Ernest Dredden's Jocose, three
years .old, second; J. A. Drake's .Good
rich, 4 years old, third. Seven horses ran.
The betting was: Portiers sto 2 against.
Jocose 5 to 1 against, Goodrich 5 to 3
against.
Between the first and second races there
was a -sudden change in the weather and
the race for the Carholme selling plate
was carried out in a blinding snowstorm,
through which little could be seen of the
race. Lester Relff, mounted on Stuck Up,
was third in a field of sixteen. Dark 'Un
was the winner. . â¢ *
b Sloan did not ride in any of the races,
as he had to go to London on business,
but he will be in the saddle to-morrow. Â¦
' Beyond" Johnny Reiff's victory in the
first event the American "jockeys did not
score any wins, but Martin finished third
twice in fields of twelve and thirteen
horses respectively, while . Lester Relff
took another third place in the last race
of the day. -"Â¦ - .
â¢ Sloan, Martin and both of the Reiffa will
ride in the Lincolnshire handicap to-mor
row. ;T$SMttSH&{tfn&MKÂ«aMHMOa
Under the new rule the race for the
L-athwell stakes for two-year-olds, run to
day, was . started by; the Gray machine.
The horses did not mind the gate and an
excellent start was effected.
the boxers deposited $500 each as a sign of
good faith and then signed articles of
agreement to meet on the 27th of April in
a twenty-round bout, each to weigh not
over 154 pounds at the ringside, and If
either fighter exceeded that v/eight he was
to forfeit 1500 for the first pound and half
his share of the purse for any overweight.
Manager Gibbs has been congratulated
for securing the match, as It will undoubt
edly prove a drawing card because of its
international importance. Murphy was
practically unknown to the followers of
the fistic game until he arrived on this
coast, and he is extremely, fortunate in
being pitted against a man of Neill's cali
ber. The Australian middle-weight may
enjoy a reputation on his native heath for
skill with his "dukes," but the sports of
this city want to see him perform before
according him. their stamp of approval.
He may be a second Fltzsimmons, but
even the lanky Cornishman was tried out
before he was given the cream of fighters
to contend against. In Justice to the pub
lic the National Club should hold a private
exhibition bout between Murphy and some
man in his class. If he proves himself the
fighter he is said to be he will prove a
great drawing card. The public has be
come chary of fighters with big reputa
tions. "Crockey" Boyle came here from
Philadelphia burdened with a great ring
record, but when he entered the arena
he proved an utter failure as a' fighter.
Manager Gibbs will do wisely . if he ar
ranges a private tryout, so that the public
can learn whether Murphy is worthy of
Netll's mettle.
Sol I^vlnson, the well-known boxing
glove maker, last night matched Frank
Rafaell to meet Rufe Turner, the colored
pugilist, before the Stockton Athletic As
sociation on the 18th of April. The men have
agreed to fight at 133 pounds and weigh in
at 5 o'clock. :-.-* .Iy'^
Frank McConnell's father has written a
letter to the Columbia Club In which he
thanks the managers for the fair way In
which they treated his son before and
after his bout with Nelll. Seldom if ever
has such a thing occurred, and it speaks
well for the club's manner of doing busi
ness.
"Biddy" Bishop, manager of "Youngf
Peter Jackson," writes the sporting editor
from Sacramento that his colored protege
is training conscientiously for his fight
with Purcell and will surely defeat him.
He is doing his. work at the Sacramento
Club's gymnasium, where the bout will
take place. ' Â¦ . â¢ : ..o . . Â¦ Â¦>.Â¦Â¦Â¦

of â¢ the : Columbian * Banking Company "t" t in
the : Claus Â¦ Spreckels' building. > The i work
of : the j past month was I ] reviewed land
passed upon. : It developed -that during
that period eighty-six deserving families
had :A>een rendered assistance, \ . which.
necessitated the expenditure - of ' $352 28."
The accounts?- of Â» the, late-f C.!>V.--;S.
Gibbs- were passed . upon , and , resolutions
of regret for his 'loss were adopted. - Sec
retary J. 8. Spear. Jr. resigned and Robert

WANT TWO MUSEUMS
MANAGED AS ONE
Very Significant Visit of W. P. Wil
son and William Harper of .
: Philadelphia. ,
W. P. Wilson, one ', of the directors of
the Philadelphia : Commercial Museum,
and William Harper, chief Tof the bureau
of Information- of- that - institution, are
coming to this city and will be here within
a few days. This information ' was ] re
ceived yesterday by Manager Goodwin of
the - Manufacturers', and Producers'^ Asso
ciation. .Their, trip to the coast has more
than. a passing significance. ' , ';.? '
When the proposition was first made to
establish . in San Francisco ; a commercial
museum to be conducted on the lines gov
erning the management iof j the Philadel
phia institution Mr. Wilson was the first
to offer to do all in his power to aid the
project. He stated that there ; would Ibe
considerable material not really = needed
there, which he was sure would be = sent
to the Western museum. ! - ';Â¦ V ;
-Since the .Western project has been, un
der such successful headway, efforts â¢ have
been made at Washington to have $50,000
appropriated by. ; Congress to ; . further I the
scheme, and the matter is now under con
sideration In the I form of an amendment
to a bill appropriating $200,000 for the Phil
adelphia museum.' Some of the local com
mittee have signified â¢ a ". desire ; to . make
theWestem museum entirely, independent
of the one In the East. The purpose of
. Mr. 'Wilson and : Mr. - Harper, coming, here
Is to confer with the local committee." and
it Is l believed that I they ~ are I desirous J of
showing the San Francisco men that the
best thing . that : can be * done is Â¦to make
. the - Pacific Â¦: Commercial ? Museum? a | part
and branch of the Philadelphia Museum.

MISUNDERSTOOD THE
OBJECT OF THE POORBOX
GÂ«orge*H. Richards, a despicable look
ing tramp, was caught in the act of pil
fering the poorbox In St. Charles Catho
lic Church, on Shotwell and Eighteenth
streets, yesterday forenoon. Richards
was seen by some of the worshipers who
were passing In and out of the- sacred
edifice hanging about the entrance with
no apparent object in -view. -When he
found an opportunity he entered the
church and- proceeded to ' the poorbox,
which is located In the vestibule, and with
a small sized screwdriver pried open the
cover and extracted Jl SS. He was seized
and held until Officer John Morrow ar
rived from the Seventeenth street station
and took him Into custody. t ;
When searched at the station he -had
upon his person $2 05. On being confronted
with the evidence and the heinousness of
his guilt In robbing a poorbox ' in a sa
cred edifice, he explained that his kriowl
edge of the American language was so
limited as to convey the impression that
the offerings In the box were for the poor
who needed assistance and, as he was
stranded, he understood he. had' a right
to take what was in the box and apply
It to bis own use. as he was among the
poorer classes. He will be given an op
portunity of enlightening one of the Po
lice Judges on his construction of the
word "poorbox" to-day. * -. ' ..,:â¢
SAN FRANCISCO. Is to have another
' great ship-building plant, with mil'
' lions of dollars of capital behind it
and capable of turning out any kind
of a ship from a sloop to a llne-ot
battle ship.- The new plant will be ope
rated entirely independent of -the big
combine known as the ship builders' trust,
which Includes such famous concerns as
the Cramps of : Philadelphia, the Union
Iron Works of this city, the Newport
News Ship Building Company and, in fact,
almost every plant of any size In the
country.
The Risdon Iron Works Is to branch
out, and It has already practically com
pleted a deal whereby it is to absorb the
big plant of the Pacific Rolling Mills. In
fact, negotiations have progressed so far
that a big forfeit/sufficiently large to in
sure the consummation of the deal, has
been posted and nothing now. remains but
to arrange for the - legal transfer of .the
Immense property from its present own
ers to the pQrchaser. â¢ Captain Taylor,
president of the Risdon Iron Works, yes
terday confirmed the story of the deal,
but was averse to giving a detailed out
line of his plan until the formal transfer
was made.. which will be in a few days.
"It is true we are preparing to branch
out," said Captain Taylor. " and . we ex
pect#to absorb the Pacific Rolling Mills,
but I prefer not to discuss the matter,un
til the negotiations are completed."
> In acquiring the Pacific Rolling Mills
plant the. Risdon Iron Works will get 1700
feet of water front,* frith water Â¦- of : suffi
cient depth to accommodate the largest
ships. Â¦ The plant covers thirty-two acres
and affords facilities for the making of
one of the most complete . ship building
plants in the country. In the neighbor
hood of $3,000,000 will be expended and
the money has already been secured, so
there can be no hitch for . lack of finan
cial backing. It Is expected the Risdon
Iron Works will employ at least three
thousand men in addition to its present
force when all its plans have been per
fected.
The proposition to establish a rival 'to
the Union Iron : Works lln this city has
been under ' consideration for some time
but only within the past few days did it
finally Â¦ assume such shape as â¢ to Justify
a publication of the; facts. Among the
first of the ' improvements contemplated
by the Â¦ managers 1 of the Risdon Iron
Works when it Is ; In complete possession
of Its new plant will be the construction
of &*glgantic drydock, capable of accom
modating the largest ships that float.
The deal -means a; great deal for San
Francisco, as the new shipbuilding plant
will not - only be an employer of thou
sands, of skilled mechanics and laborers,
but it will enter the field as a bidder for
contracts to 1 build merchantmen, passen
ger steamers and warships, as an active
and I aggressive â¢ competitor <â¢'Â¦ of the trust
and one that will have sufficient backing
of a- financial character to fight the mo
nopoly to a' finish,- should the latter at
tempt :to throttle the enterprise.

lnal libel to be a publication of defamatory
matter, willfully and with malicious Intent to
injure another. In this complaint it Is alleged
that the defamatory matter In question was
published by defendant "knowingly and will
fully"; and that said article "tends and was
intended to Impeach the honesty, integrity and
reputation of plaintiff, and expose htm to public
hatred, contempt and ridicule."- In every pub
lic offense there must exist a union of act and
Intentâ that Is to say, an unlawful act must' be
committed with an unlawful purpose. The pub
lication of libelous matter, with malicious in
tent is a public offense. In this case the mat
ter published, if untrue, was defamatory; and.
if willfully published, with intent- to injure
plaintiff as is alleged in the complaint." then we
have the commission of an unlawful ' act
prompted by an unlawful purpose; and in these
particulars we also find the elements which con
stitute a public Â¦ offense. ... . . Â»
Furthermore, section 239 gives a right of ac
tion, not to the party "aggrieved," but to any
person whomsoever; thus indicating that, in the
legislative Intent, the offense In question vlo
latee the rights of people in general.
In Thurston vs. Clark, 107 Cal. 255. proceed
ings were Instituted by the Informer to remove
from effice the Sheriff of Glenn County, and it
was again held that a proceeding instituted un
der section 772 was, in all its essentials of
cause and effect, a criminal proceeding; and the
court, in support of its opinion, cited the case
of Bovd vs. The United States. 116 U. S. 616,
wherein, under a Federal statute, relating to
the importation of aliens under labor contracts,
it was held that the proceeding, "though an
action civil in form, was unquestionably crim
inal in its nature." to such an extent that de
fendant therein could not be compelled to bear
witness against himself.
In Kiibur vs. Law, 111 CaL 237. where a sim
ilar doctrine was maintained, the court said
that the circumstance that section 772 was in
serted in tiie Penal Code "was of Itself suffi
cient to indicate the legislative intent to con
etltute it a criminal proceeding." And it was
further said that the judgment Imposing a fine
which, in whole or in part, shall go to the ln
lormer. Is not euch an anomaly in criminal
practice as to require discussion. Perhaps the
prosecution of this action ought to be in the
name of the people."
It would thus aeem that the publication of
the article in question was in effect an omis
sion on the part of defendant to obey the man
date of a public law; and for such omission the
Legislature has imposed a fine of }1000.
It thus appears, first, that section 253 is ex
presely made part of the Penal Code; eecond.
that in legal effect it ordains that "a fine"
shall be imposed uron the offender: third, that
a portion of such fine shall be paid into the
State treasury; fourth, that an action may be
instituted by any person: and fifth, that in this
particular case both of the elements of crime,
naraely. an unlawful act and an unlawful In
tent, are charged. For these reasons and un
der the cases cited. I am of opinion that the
proceeding in question can only be maintained
in the name of the people of the State of Cali
fornia.
Upon this ground the demurrer to the com
plaint !Â« sustained.
POOLROOM ORDER

Substitute Offered to Prohibit

Board of Supervisors Invite Proposals for Sale
of Water Supply Systemsâ Many Meas
ures Are Finally Passed. :
THE session of : the Supervisors yesterday was deeply significant to
the ; people â¢of this city. The meetlng.of the board was remarkable not
for what the members accomplished, nor for what they did not do, but
for the exhibition which his Honor, " the . Mayor, exercising j the prlvi
,-lege of -his personality, was- permitted to make. - Mayor Phelan . donned
his > armor. yesterday In the discussion relative to the Tobln ordinance, which
was designed to. prohibit In this city all forms' of public gambling. The or
dinance and Its merits were at the disposal of the Board of Supervisors, to
be determined as. the judgment of. the board dictated: < Mayor, Phelan Inter
jected himself-; Into the discussion "and took the opportunity to observe that
"The 'Call' for two days, "through some peculiar circumstance,"- had been si
lent In reference to the merits or demerits of the proposed ordinance. Â¦
, That the Mayor drew a false conclusion from a false statement of facts
, every- one who has followed current events must' know. But the Mayor In
sisted in dragging Into the affair a newspaper which -had no proper place In
the controversy. In doing this the Mayor, perhaps,-. was Justified. The Call
will admit a compensation for its pains if It has taught Mayor Phelan the
meaning and the responsibility of actions that are peculiar.
,If The Call has proved to Mayor Phelan, what it has proved to every citi
zen of San Francisco, that he has been.dereliot In his duty as a public offi
cer; that he has been guilty of a felony- which submits him to the penalties
prescribed in this State; that neither- his; public nor his private life Justifies
, him In the arrogance of censorship of morals or citizenship, then the task
has been rewarded by a benefit, which even Mayor' Phelan must recognize.
The Tobin ordinance was presented- to' the- Board of Supervisors by one
of Its own members. The proposed. law was to be adopted or. rejected by the
board, not by The Call. Supervisor, Tobln had his own reason for introducing
the.measure. His name has been too often lri the weekly press of this city
for any one to doubt that he knew the ground upon which he Is standing.
He knows the value. of a name and of a reputation, and when he gave a
reason for the false 'assertion that The' Call has been silent In reference to
his proposed . ordinance he has. surely a; bitter, knowledge of "ways that
; are dark and tricks that are vain.'-' ...
Supervisor Tobln has been taught quickly In the school of his master.
He has seen Mayor Phelan exposed to public shame as the barterer of the
greatest institutions In this city. - He has . seen Mayor Phelan ' false to .pri
vate promise and public pledge. He has seen .the results of a compact be
tween a politician and' a blackleg. "He has witnessed : the disastrous conse
quences of a greed for power. He has witnessed the expose of a plot which
left the Mayor of this city and his.coconspirators naked in their shame. He ;
Â¦ has heard the swish of the lash of public scorn, but he Is yet to feel Its
*.tlng upon his own back. "When he thinks therefore that "ways that are ;
V^ark and tricks that are vain" will explain the actions of. others, not him
.tÂ»lf or his master, let him drop his latchstring and reflect. Supervisor To- !
lÂ«n is not driving at a polo ball when be Is considering questions that affect
t?ie welfare of this city. ?-,;.- '.':. <
fHE Tobln poolroom order, by which
it was proposed to prohibit the, sell-
Ing of pools on contests of any de
scription, was Indefinitely postponed
by tne Board of Supervisors yesterday.
In putting his motion to postpone Reed
stated that the Police Committee desired
to file a majority report prohibiting pool
selling on horse and dog racing. He con
sidered the Tobin ordinance as too sweep-
Ing, and besides it might be declared il
legal because it contained two provisions
In tha same orderâ one prohibiting gam
bling and the other making it a penalty,
to vl'sit gambling places. Â¦
"Well." said the Mayor, , "Is not that
one Subject?"
: "Yt/u may be of that opinion,' retorted
Reed? "but I am not. I desire further to
state! that there appears to^be a unani
mous â¢ opinion In this board to close the
poolrooms. I think, however, that an ex
ception should be made in the case- of
pool^sold on legitimate boxing contests
and'-regulated by. proper restrictions. -I
do rot think that betting on . prize-fights
ever ruined anybody. All cases , of em
beÂ»'Â«ment are directly traceable to bet
ting on horse racing."
- Brandensteln opposed Indefinite post
ponement, saying ,that the vice was as
meretricious- in one form as the other.
Toblh held that the only objection to his
ordinance ' was that It â¢ was too sweeping.
He rtgarded It as absurd to brand a man
as a criminal who made a wager on a
football game while a virtue was made of
betting on horse and dog races..
"At this point the Mayor, who apparently
had been waiting for an opportunity to
put his foot In it. Interposed:
"Mr. Tobin, do you know what in
fluence has deterred one of the news
papers from interesting itself further
in this ordinance? I notice The Call
has been silent for. two days on the
subject and it looks rather peculiar."
"I do not know the reason," . re
plied Tobin, following in the foot
steps of the miniature Mayor, "but I
suppose it is on the principle of the
heathen Chinee, who 'for ways that
are dark and tricks that are vain,'
etc.," which brilliant "sally was
greeted with a laugh of the feeblest
description.
On the motion for Indefinite postpone
ment the following was the vote: . - .
Ayesâ Booth, Boxton,; Curtis, Connor,
Duboce," Dwyer, Helms, Hotaling. McCar-
Noesâ Brandensteln, Comte, d'Ancona,

Reed' then' asked permission to submit
two ordinances designed to .put an end
to poolselllng on hor.se and dog racing,
but several objections being made he pre
sented them later during the regular or
der, and they were referred to the Police
Committee. The first ordinance provides

SAN QUENTIN PRISON. March 26.â
John Phillips, alias "Frisco Slim." one of
the most desperate criminals. wearing the
stripes, this afternoon made an attack on
Guard Patrick Connelly,' who had inter
vened between him and two other con
victs. > v
"Frisco Slim," as he is known through
out, the State, is serving a life term for
the murder of a night watchman in a de
pot In Contra Costa County. "Slim" was
Interrupted by the watchman in the act of
cracking a safe, and shot and killed the
man on the spot. He .was shortly after ar
rested and the trial resulted in a life sen
tence. He has since a month ago worked
in the Jute mill here, and it was there
that the assault occurred which may send
him to the incorrigible cell till death re
leases him. Â¦':Â¦:: . \
Bad blood has existed for some time be-
tween Frank Harp and Jose Sanchez, the
men he attacked, and Phillips. To-day
they met In, the jute mill, and without a
word of warning the desperate man
raised a heavy steel spool used for wind
ing Jute and aimed a blow at the head of
Sanchez, which cut- his scalp :In -two
places. Harp attempted to avoid the
murderous impact of a second spool, only
to receive a gash in the back of the neck,
which almost severed the jugular vein.
Guard Connelly, armed only with . *
heavy cane, rushed at Phillips, who when
he saw the - guard coming snatched up a
third spool, at the same time shouting,
"I've got.it In for you; I'll do you up."
following the -words with a swing at the
guard's head. Connelly ducked and
caught Phillips a blow on the head with
his cane that felled him to the ground.
Phillips was immediately bound and
thrown* Into the "black hole," where he
will remain till the Board of Prison Di
rectors decide as to his fate.
Under the name of "Frisco Slim" Phil
lips has. attained a criminal reputation
extending throughout the State.. He was
transferred from Folsom to San Quentiu,
and since his incarceration at. the latter
prison has been foremost among the des
perate felons confined there. About a
year ago he attempted to kill > Superin
tendent Butterworth with a seventy-pound
weight used for weighting jute.- "Frisco
Slim" has a- grudge against Connelly, as
the latter .was the official appointed' to
search the- prisoners' cells, and on one
occasion got. "Slim" in. trouble by discov

MOREHOUSE'S LAW
SHAKES THE CODE
Freak Anti-Newspaper Act Was
Put in the Wrong Book by
Wise Legislators.
Charles A. Bennett, a Corporation Sole, Finds
His Suit Against The Call Was an
Expensive Luxury.
MOREHOUSETS law requiring every
writer In a newspaper to sign each
article from his penâ the law that
6o thoroughly tested the Intel
lectuality of the majority of the
late assembled Legislatureâ has failed to
stand the test of the law, at least In the
manner la which the "father of the bill"
Intended It should. Various reasons for
the enactment of this legal freak were
assigned at the time of Its passage and
various theories were advanced as to the
great reform It would work in the publi
cation of metropolitan Journals. Its use
fulness for the desired purpose was even
despaired of by the odorous lobby, but
confidence came to Its promoters and they
believed that they had furnished the
means for the accomplishment of a great
end when Charles A. Bennett, a corpora
tion sole, doing business under the firm
style and name of the Western Dairy
men's Exchange. 22$ Clay street, filed suit
against The Call to recover $1000 damages
for the failure of a writer whose pen
picture of Bennett's dealings contained a
strong intimation that he was a swindler,
was not signed as required by the More
bouse law.
Bennett represented to various dairy
men of Gllroy and that vicinity that he
was the manager for the Western Dairy
men's Exchange. On his false represen
tations he secured various consignments,
but finally, when the profits did not ma
terialize, his victims became suspicious.
An Investigation resulted and the Western
Dairymen's Exchange was found to be a
myth. Many cheeses and other produce
were found at nls house, 4124 Eighteenth
street. He was arrested and returned to
the scene of hla operations at Gilroy, and
later filed suit against The Call as stated.
He refrained from suing this paper for
libel, for to recover Judgment In a libel
action it Is necessary to prove that the
article was malicious and false. The
Morehouse law suited Bennett better, and
under it he proceeded. A demurrer to his
complaint was interposed on behalf of
The Call by Attorneys Lloyd & Wood.
Garret W. McEnerr.ey and E. F. Preston.
In which It was contended that the law
on which the action was founded was
penal in character and Intended for the
benefit of the people at large instead of
for the remuneration of any individual for
damages he had sustained through the
neglect of a writer to sign his name to
an article in which the plaintiff was the
subject. _
Notwithstanding the fact that Senator
Morehouse upheld his creation to the last
and liled a brief with the court In support.
Judge Hunt yesterday decided that de
fondant's contention was correct and the
demurrer was therefore sustained. Judge
Hunt's opinion in full reads:
The defendant published of and conoemin*
the r>!aimiS a certain article, which, if false,
was libelous. The article was unsigned.
section 2i9 of the Penal Code, as amended In
ivs, provided that every article printed or
published in thie State, which tends to im
peach the honesty or Integrity of another, and
th<*-ety exposes him to public hatred, con
tempt or ridicule, must be supplemented by
th<Â» true name of the writer of such article:
and for an omission thus to sign said article
the publisher "shall forfeit the sum of $1000.
whi'-h cum may be cued for and recovered
arÂ»!nrt muJ Duhlisher in a civil action in the
name of try person who may bring an action
thorefor: one-holf of the amount to be paid Into
the treasury of the State and the other half
to' be retained by the plaintiff." â¢
This action is brought to recover said sum
of VJ&).
A corr.x>!a!r.t Is demurred to upon the ground
"that lualnUff has no legal capacity to sue;
that the omif*<ion charged vat a public offense,
and any protr-cution therefor, or proceeding
thereon, must be had In the name ofthe people
of California,
The State constitution provides that all
prosecution* for public offenses shall be con
ductf-d ra the name of the people.
. Section tf of the Penal Code defines a public
offense as "an act committed or omitted in
violation of a law, forbidding or commanding
it. to which U annexed, upon conviction there
of. thÂ« following punishment*:" and among
the jjunishmects thus provided for Is a fine.
ThÂ«? amendment In question was by section 1
thereof adJed to the Penal Code of the State
Â«t California: and it Is to be found In the
charter relating to criminal libels; this chapter
Is c-ontained in part Â£ of the Penal Code.. which
relates to crimes against the person.
Wheeler vs. Dcsnell, 110 Cal. 655. was a rro
ceeding instituted to 6ecure the removal of a
l>istrict Attorney from office, under section 722
of the Penal Code, which authorized the prose
cution of such proceedings against the officials
guilty of official misconduct upon information
presented by any person: and further provided
that upon conviction the accused should be
re-moved from office and a Judgment for 1509
should be rendered agalnrt him in favor of the
informer. The court held that the proceeding
was In its nature a criminal proceeding; and
that the arnonnt awarded upon conviction to
the informer was '"nothinc more nor less than
a fine." Under section 722 It will be observed
that the sum recovered and denominated "a
fine" went to the informer; while. In this
<-ase. one-half of the amount recovered must
be oaid into the State treasury, which gives
It more then ever a complexion of a fine.
If the sum of SIOOQ mentioned in section 2SS is
to be regarded as a fine, then the offense for
which the fine is imposed is a public offense
w-thin the mining of the Penal Code.
This conclusion is strengthened by the fart
that the section in question was expressly made
part of the Penal Code and part of a chapter
which relates to criminal libeL ..â¢:_.-Â¦.

BRITAIN'S MILITARY PROBLEM.
DEBATES in Great Britain over^the proposed
increase of the military strength of the empire
are growing bitter. It appears to be conceded
that no great increase of the army can be attained
without conscription of some kind, and it is upon the
issue of compulsory service the strife rages. There
are those who maintain that enforced service in the
army would be a benefit to the youth of the natiefn.
while others with vehemence assert it would be
ruinous at once to the welfare of the people and the
ancient constitution of the realm.
At present the army appears to be totally inadequate
to the defense of the widespread empire. In a recent
debate- in Parliament Lord Rosebery, alluding to the
claim that Great Britain, besides the men at that time
in South Africa, had 409,000 available troops, said:
"How is that body composed? It contains 9^,000
regulars. These regular troops cannot stand a very
searching analysis at the present moment. They are
men too young to be sent to the front and men who
are required for the depots. The next item is 12,000"
reserves. Have they been called outi or are : they at
home? Then there are 7000 yeomanry and 77,000
militia. These cannot at present be embodied be
cause we have no barracks to put them in. Last "we
have 215,000 volunteers. * ".* * Can these volun
teers by any stretch of imagination, be called soldiers'" 1
in the scientific sense of the word? It is perfectly
certain that they cannot be. . It has been suggested
that they have a month's training when the weather,
permits. How has that proposal been received? -I
venture to say with the unanimous condemnation of'
all the people whom it affects and concerns. There
is no large employer of labor in the country who
sanctions such a proposal or believes it' workable.?
That is the showing of,, the military force Great
Britain would have to rely upon at this time shbpld
she be confronted by^ a war with a foreign .pow^r, or
by insurrection in India. Â» It is not strange, therefore,
that some of the most conservative of her statesmen
advocate conscription. Â¦ In . tlje same debate in which
Roscbcry's speech was : made Lord. Blythswood,' one
of the most influential Tories in Scotland, 'declared
himself in favor of the adoption of -compulsory serV
vice,- and added. "All classes must be treated alike ;
there must be no exemptions." .
Against the pi oject," however, the protest is strong.!
Frederic Harrison has recently pointed Tout that com
pulsory service in the : British ; army would [ be a very
different thing from that in the armies of 'Continental
Europe. ] "The British conscript," he says, Â¦ "will ' Â¦be
dragged to the] ends of the earth, 1 among savages, 1 in
deserts, , swamps and mountains. : He cannot .come
back in a year or twoâ foreign -service must beVpro-

God forgave his sins, . and what he felt
he began to tell others. Methodism was
then born and its mission is to promulgate
a knowable religion. - The witness of the
Spirit in the individual believer is the very
heart and soul of Methodism. So . that
the trouble with the church is a disease
of the heart. What began by the skipping
of a beat has resulted in some cases in
heart failure. We have not been true to
this great depositum of doctrine and ex
perience. We have been running wild on
catholicity and have got so broad that our
cutting edge is gone. And the effect of
that sort of thing is seen in the fact that
the Unitarian year book gives the num
ber of church buildings in the United
States in IS3O as 133. and in 1599, nearly
three-quarters â¢of a century later, they
report only Â«Â»â a pain of 256 churches in
nearly seventy years. If a religion of ne
gation and doubt is what. this age wants
why do the churches that preach that
style of doctrine gain but 256 in seventy
years while the churches that preach
Christ, the atonement, sin and hell have
multiplied by tens of thousands; have
given hundreds of millions to missions
and have increased in membership by
millions?
Another slipped cog in our church life
is a lack of passion for souls. There Is a
little disposition in some Methodist circled
to carp and cavil at revivals of religion
and' at our methods of promoting them.
The fact is. however, that most of our
congregations do not need a wet blanket
to put out wildfire half as much as they
need a -fire of some kind to keep them
from freezing into an ice ' pack as did
the Fram. Of all the people in the world
Methodists ought to believe in revivals.
Methodism was born and cradled in a
revival and nothing -can withstand her
when, putting on her garments of salva
tion, with holy flre in her heart and re
vival songs on her lips she preaches and
witnesses to the old Gospel.
"Â¦ We are sometimes proud to say that
Methodism was born in a Greek class in
Oxford University, . and that the early
Methodists could all read the Bible in the
original tongues. But we ought to be
prouder that Methodism did not stay lin

A CONTRIBUTION S ON THE CONDITION OF THE METHODIST. CHURCH IN- WHICH ROLLA V. WATT AND
REV. HORATIO STEBBINS HAVE ALREADY ADVANCED OPINIONS.
the Greek class In college, but went ont
into the fields, the mines, the potteries,
the slums and* carried the l!?ht of the
Gospel Into the dark places of the earth.
Methodism has a great deal of machin
ery and it Is very perfect and very highly
polished and perhaps a little complicated.
Every four years we run it into the
roundhouse of the general conference and
give It an overhauling. We tap all the
wheels and inspect all the 'bailers. 1 But
what is the good of all thia intricate ma
chinery if It has lost connection with the
central source of power? All our ma
chinery cannot turn out a single Christian
unless it is geared on to the Infinite.
Brethren of the laity, you share with
the ministry the responsibility for the
church's ' decline In revival power. -We
need more of the co-operation of our lead
ing laymen in the, revival work of the
church. No regiment ever won a battle
in which the colonels did all the figatlnv.
Laymen can carry the Gospel as no one
else can into the occupations and homes
of the pe.ople. Paul had his . trade and
worked at it. but what a soul winner he
was. "This one thing I do" with him did
not mean tent making. The church ought
to double itself every year, but thousands
of the laity have never won a soul or
lifted a finger to bring any one to Christ.
Another thing the Bishops deplore is
the lack of deep-seated conviction of duty
among the ministry and laity of the
church.- How few "hold sacred the ordi
nances of God and endeavor as much as
in .them lies to promote the welfare of
their brethren and the advancement oÂ£
the Redeemer's kingdom," as we solemn
ly promised to do at the altars of the
church. -The church commands but little
of the time of many Methodists, and that
only when it is convenient. Business is
first, pleasure second, and the church Is
generally a bad third in the race.
I make 'these' 'comparisons between
thlygs that are lawful and right.- It Is
proper to attend diligently to business,
to keep your social engagements: it is
proper for you to be interested in poli
tics. But these are not the highest con
cerns of a Christian, if our profession is
an honest one. We do not profess that
they are: we do profess that religion is.
And when our -unsaved friends see us put
religion first in our profession and last in
our practice, what is their Just and logical
conclusion? Why, that the whole thing
is. In the language of the street, a "falsa
alarm."
Finally, what is the future of Metho
dism? Isaac Taylor, the great divine, said
in the days.of Wesley. "I will give Metho
dism 100 years to run its course." Well.
the 100 years have passed and Methodism
stands at the threshold of the twentieth
century rejoicing as a strong man to run
a race, with 3,000,000 members in America
and 25,000.000 of adherents In the whole
world. If she will be true to her history,
if she will seek for the old paths and not
remove the ancient landmarks that the
fathers have set. if she keeps her ban
ners ever waving in the front of every
conflict against wroni? and for humanity,
if. above all, she remains the church of
the common people, she will live on blessr
ing and blest, and our fathers looking
down from heaven shall see her during
the twentieth century doing more than
any other church to roll the old globe
into the light of the millennial day.
The Committee on Public Utilities of the Board of
Supervisors is displaying a childlike confidence in
human nature that is refreshing. The members of
the committee are inclined to think that the telephone
monopoly will name a fair price at which it will sell
its cinch -on the public. .
It is said that the Railroad Commissioners intend
to discipline the Southern Pacific Company for its
gross freight rate exactions in the San Joaquin Val
ley.' It is probable, therefore, that we will soon hear
that William F. Herrin has decided to entertain a
select jjarty at dinner.
Ed Corrigan, the gambler, boasts that he has a
blacklist of his enemies. He* might save himself
trouble and the expense of pen and paper by making
a list of his friends.

BAD SYSTEMS Of TAXATION.
T~} EFORE the New York legislature there Â¦ is
\\ pending a mortgage tax bill which has justly
Â¦ ... â^..aroused the opposition of all persons who have
given any study to the subject of taxation. The bill
exempts all mortgages already made at less than 4 per
cent interest, but imposes a tax upon air others. The
opponents of the measure are therefore not far wrong
in declaring it should be entitled "An act to place the
burden of State government upon the owners ; of
small. properties, and boom the bond issues of cer
tain corporations." . â
The people of California have had experience with
the taxation of mortgages and know what the effects
of such- taxes are. Capitalists naturally and: rightly
expect to receive for their money the rate of interest
that prevails in the community at the time the Ib^n is
made. . If, therefore, they know they have to pay â¢ a
tax upon the mortgage given as security for the loan,
they exact a rate of interest sufficiently high to cover
the tax. -There can be no escape from the operation
of *that method f of doing, business, and accordingly! a
tax like that proposed inyNew York would have, the
effect of^increasing, the burden of taxation upon men
who own mortgaged property and pay ; high rates'
of interest, while leaving. untaxed the great corpora
tions or large: land-owners whose credit is so high'
and who borrow such . large amounts .that they, can
obtain money for less than 4 per cent. 1 .'
California, "however, has mor no right as yet to con
demn New -York on a score of this kind.. ,We impose
taxes not only on mortgages ' but upon , bonds issued
by counties and by municipalities for purposes of pub
lic improvement. As-'a result of that tax our" bonds
have to be.sold in the East, for local banks and capi
talists- can -hardly afford to buy them and:pay : the
taxes on theni: The ; result ' is ; that '. as : . the! bonds^are'
held outside the, State we not only lose the tax; on
tHem, but the annual interest has to be sent abroad,
so that we are doubly losers by the folly.
; The incidence of: taxation is a subject of : which ithe
average legislator .â¢ apparently knows , little and cafes
less.' Thus a^ large. number of taxes are levied whose
effects. are, just ; ; the;;opposite of; what, was- intended.-
New York will .find .the proposed bill *. will impose a
; tax Inpt upon . the rich man, ; who lends" t money ,* ; but
upon the poor man, who has to borrow, and the tax
will be the; more unfair because it will be imposecl
not upon all \ land-owners .alike, but ; only* upon \ those
whose lands are rnortgaged.*^Tht people' of Â¦ Califor-^
nia have learned at last the folly of taxing' local bonds,
and ; accordingly the ; Legislature has provided to sub
mit_^at_'the,corningelection an amendmeht to the^con
stitutioniepealing that form of taxation, r and the pros- :
pects are .it[will_;be'carried;by an^overwliielming.Vote/

POLITICAL ARTIFICE.
T T was expected that the Populist National Con-
I vention would nominate Colonel Bryan outright
lor the Presidency. But it seems that since he
wrote the Democratic national platform at the Lin
cola meeting: there has arisen objection to the Popu
list nomination outright. The desire for -fusion is. no
less than it was. The search for votes, wherever they
may be had and on whatever terms, is as active as
ever. The ambition of the Colonel is vaulting and
acrobat-like as ever. But there is a feeling among
his alleged Democratic supporters that his recent
platform, embracing ail known Populist doctrines,
should be suScient grounds for fusion and should
be adopted by the Populists. This would rid Colon ei
Bryan of ali embarrassment. Instead of riding two
hcrses under two saddles he would perform the
widely known and justly celebrated feat of riding two
horses under one saddle. But if there is any pleasure
left in Populism it is in drafting platforms. It is
a mistake to suppose that cither the Ocala, Omaha or
St. Louis platform of that party anywhere near ex
hausts the possibilities of its mud pie genius in pre
senting issues. Several natural laws besides gravita
tion remain for it to attack by resolution, and it is
eager for the chance. Making a platform to make up
do-wn and down up, to reverse the points of the com
pass shift zenith and nadir, repeal the Gresham law
and likewise the laws of Keppler, all by statute in
snch cases made and provided, is the loved pastime of
the Popuiist philosophers. This spring their fancy
lightly turns to this favorite occupation, and they
don't propose to have their party victuals chewed for
them in advance, even by a jawbone as distinguished
as that of Colonel Bryan. "*- -
They will have a platform which resembles a*house
built of fecond-hand lumber, that has the colors har
lequin matched that were laid upon the many houses
from which- it was taken. Adopting strange principles
and assimilating untamed ami untried policies has
been Colonel Bryan's political dissipation. He said
once that he could never see four or five people to
gether without wanting to make a speech to them.
So he warts to taste and .try everything new in poli
tical cookery. This habit is disordering his political
liver and begins to give his political complexion the
tint of jaundice. His friends are fearful of the effect
upon a liver already in a morbid, torpid, inactive con
dition, if he should swallow the minced mystery of the
promised Populist platform.
To avoid this an artifice is proposed. Senator Al
len of Nebraska is to be nominated by that party for
President, and in due time is to resign in favor of
Colonel Bryan. In this way there will be fusion.
Colonel Bryan will be the candidate of both parties,
but will not have to sit down publicly and swallow,
digest and assimilate the Populist platform.
It is amazing that men of any political experience
fhould adopt such transparent, artifices. They de
ceive no one. There is no mitigation of any of the
aversion to fusion in cither party. Colonel Bryan
will be under exactly the same obligation to the Popu
lists as if he swallowed their platform, washed it
down and swore that he liked it

THE SIGNATURE LAW.
BY the decision of Judge Hunt sustaining the"
demurrer of the defendant in the case of Charles
A. Bennett vs. The Call the newspaper signa-.
ture act, of which so much was heard last year, has
been virtually declared to be invalid/ and it will now
scon pass into the limbo of forgotten things.
The suit was brought against The Call because it had
(to use the language of the "decision)?"published. # of
and concerning the plaintiff a certain article. which, if
false, was libelous ; and the article was unsigned."'
Complaint was made by the plaintiff that the publica
tion was a violation of section 259 of the Penal Code
as amended in 1809. The section provides that every
article printed or published in the State which tend 3
to impeach the honesty or integrity of another and
thereby expose him to public hatred or contempt 6.'
ridicule must be supplemented Â¦. by the true name of
the writer of such article, and for an omission thus to
sign said article the publisher shall forfeit the sum of
$1000, which sum may be sued for and" recovered
against such publisher in a civil action in the name
of any person who may bring an action therefor, one
half the amount to be paid into the treasury of the
State and the other half to be retained by the plain
tiff. â¢ :\ '
The complaint was demurred to upon the ground
that the plaintiff had no legal capacity to sue, that
the omission charged was a public offense and that
any prosecution therefor must be had in the name
of the people of California; In an elaborate review of
the law and the precedents bearing upon the case
Judge Hunt sustains the demurrer. The decision. in
full can be found in another column.- The conclusion
declares: "It thus appears, first, that section
259 is expressly made part of the Penal Code;
second, that in legal effect it ordains that a
fine shall be imposed upon the offender;
third, that a portion of such fine shall be paid into
the State treasury; fourth, that an action may be in
stituted by any person ; fifth, that in this particular
case both of the elements of crime, namely, an un
lawful act and an unlawful intent, are charged. -For
these reasons and under the cases cited, I am- of
opinion that the proceeding in question can only be
maintained in the name of the people of the State of
California. Upon this ground the demurrer to the
complaint is sustained.". .
Thus ends one of the pettiest bits of spitework ever
attempted by a legislative body. "The object ; of the
act was to gratify the anger felt toward the press by
certain members of the Legislature because of the
fearlessness with which it exposed their rascality. v. It
was as futile as it was foolish, for it has never had
any effect, and is now shown to be worthless.. Among
the legislators who voted for the act were many who
practice law, but it is . evident they permitted their
spite rather than their brains to direct them in the
matter, for they devised the act in such a manner, as to
render it incapable of defense in court. -
A howl of indignation has gone up from the north
ern part of the city at the great smoke-pile which the
Board of Health is maintaining in Chinatown} That
is always the way. People can't have a little fun with
out somebody raises a protest.
THE Methodist church has been called
to its knees by it 3" chief ministers.
The great advance which had char
acterized the; preceding decade has
halted. The column wavered and
during the .last year it has actually
fallen back. This does riot apply to
: .every, individual church and confer
ence in Methodism. :,This church has made
substantial gains ; and ; this conference
shows a small; balance 'on the 'right side;
but as a, denomination ' Methodism has
lost. It should be said, however, that the
reported loss is not really In membership,
but in candidates for membership called
probationers. She has not ; entered as
many of these upon her lists as In pre
.vious years' and this makes an apparent
loss of. 21.000. .
v There are some who object to the ac
knowledgment of ' the condition of . the
church In this public and official way.
They think our commanders should cen
sor the dispatches when * there is : a de
feat. ; But i what our Bishops state of a
loss of aggressive power in our church is
true of , all the denominations and the
world knows It. Taking all the denomina
tions together the net gain during the
last year was only 1.3 per cent, while the
average net ] gain ; for the past decade is
a little over 3 ; per cent: the Methodist
gain in the \ last decade being two- thirds
as much as the Baptist, Presbyterian
and Congregatlonallst gain together. ,
I hold that it is â¢ best to be frank and
honest about the condition that confronts
us. I ; fear,, that as : Methodists '., we have
said so much about the past that we have
become" careless of the present. We have
spent so much time in glorifying our an
cestors that we have done. nothing to give
our descendants a chance to glorify us.
We need to stop pointing complacently to
the; goodly stones, in the structure of our
great church." The Jews said, pointing
to the splendid temple, "See what goodly
stones and buildings are these!" But,
alas, the holy fire had disappeared from
the temple altars and Jesus said, "There
shall not one stone be left upon another
that shall not" be thrown down." We
need to talk less about the splendor of
our altars and more about the fire upon
them. â¢. Â¦ - * Â¦
Some things must be avoided, some
gloriously attempted. If ye are to win
The Bishops call their address the ."Seal
of the Covenant" and emphasize the fact
that Methodism ,Is ; experience â vital
Christian life: and that the witness of the
Spirit is the heart-beat of that. life. One
hundred and seventy-five years ago there
were hot 100 men in Christendom who
would have dared to say that they knew
their sins forgiven.
God wanted that truth, long burled un
der the dust of formalism and ritualism,
to get currency in the world once more.
In. 1729 in. a little prayer-meeting In Al
dersgate street, London, while . hearing
one read Luther's preface to the epistle
to the Romans, John Wesley felt -his
heart "strangely warmed," and felt that
longed. And when he comes; back from the Punjab,
Hongkong, the Congo, Uganda, the Soudan," he will
come back perhaps by disease and unfit for
civil and industrial life at home. He will not be like
the German or the French soldier, learning his' drill
to defend his native land. He will be fighting with
colored people to coerce some free people or to con
quer goldfields for foreign speculators. I A worse edu
cation for a useful tradesman cannot be devised. -All
the fine talk about the moral advantages of soldier
ing is stuff." . ?
Altogether the problem is of a nature to perplex
more sagacious brains than those of the present
Ministry. From the war with the two small republics
of South Africa the great empire is receiving many
valuable : lessons, but as' yet her statesmen and her
people are far from understanding how to profit by
â¢;em.
THE CALL OF THE CHURCH TO PRAYER
THE SAX FBA^GISCO GALL, .TO^D^^-^M^^^T^iyiOOO^
A BOSTON EXPERIENCE.
T""YOSTON is one of the oldest and most highly
K\ organized municipalities in this country. It
~^ has a superior order of population and puts re
markable intelligence into its public administration.
In line with what is known as advanced thought upon
the subject of municipal duty, that city entered upon
an extensive programme, of municipal ownership.
The Cochituate water works have long been in public
ownership, and the advance movement in Boston
simply extended and'projected that policy to other:
things. Under Mayor Josiah Quincy, who is a radi
cal municipal reformer and a very energetic officer
and citizen, belonging to one of the oldest and most
honored Massachusetts families, municipal ice works,
a city printing office, an electrical construction divi
sion, a city repair shop and many other public utili
ties were established. In its initiation this policy was.
highly satisfactory, and still further social experi-,
racnts were waiting impatiently to follow the lead of
these pioneers. These were expected to be in line
with the Glasgow policy, where the city owns not only
the lighting plant, street railways and public baths, but
the washhouses, lodging-houses, model homes for
widows, model homes for widowers and a number of
other paternal provisions for the wants of the people,
which in a thrifty country they are in the habit. oi
supplying for themselves.
The Scientific American and other American jour
nals claim that Glasgow, from the operation of her
public utilities, derives all the public revenue "she
needs and levies no tax whatever upon her people,
except what they pay for' the use of the utilities.
It is no wonder that Boston, with the most or
derly and intelligent of populations, entered with high
hopes upon a policy imitative of Glasgow. The New
York Nation has studied the results, and, according
to that very reliable authority, it will be a long time
before Boston gets all her .revenues out of public
ownership and can dispense with other forms of taxa
tion.
When the market price of ice in Boston was $3 a
ton, it cost the city $60 a ton to procure ice through
the municipal department. Printing in the city print
ing office cost from 20 to 50 per cent more than when
done in private offices by contract.
In the electrical and repair departments the same
excess of cost appeared. Work which a private con
tractor offered to do for $40, when done by the city
in its own shop cost $300.
It has been found necessary to abolish two of these
new departments of public activity, and the other 3
must demonstrate their utility or they will also go.
The Nation seems to regret this outcome, but sug
gests that in large American cities, under universal
suffrage the operation- of public utilities is attended
by features incompatible with its success.
Certainly Boston has shown quite unusual nerve in
confessing and abandoning the further prosecution of
a' failure. It would be very useful to the people of
other cities if Mayor Quincy would make public his
opinion of the reason for the* failure.
The American mind is now in a plastic condition
on this subject. If it be true that the fine government
of Glasgow is supported entirely upon the revenues of
public ownership, Americans will not be contented
until they have amply tried an experiment which has
had such desirable results. If they are incompatible
with universal suffrage, it is a very important thing to
know why.
Politicians may be expected to encourage any view
of the policy that will make votes. Issues upon which
they are elected change or are forgotten. They arc
seldom held responsible for the failure of their
prophecies.
But when a policy is entered upon its effect on the
public is permanent, unless, as in the case of Boston,
a retreat is ordered. - t
Collectivism is a comprehensive term and there be
advocates of it who begin with public ownership of
water, light plant and railways, and end with a general
public kitchen and a municipal assumption of all
housekeeping"and all domestic cares.

Progreso Mining Company's Trus

session of All Their Books
and Documents.
Mrs. Theresa Bell is confident that she
will wrest fortune from the wreck of. the
estate of her lute husband, Thomas Bell,
and she has opened the preliminaries with
a rush. Some time ago Mrs. Bell shook
off the spell Of inactivity that' resulted in
so much loss to her and made: her start
toward recovering her estate by ordering
"Mammy" Pleasant out of the "House
of Mystery" forever. Now rid of the aged
negress sne is Â¦. making her: fight for her
property." Last Friday she secured an
order removing George Staacke. as exec
utor of decedent's will and appointing her
self as executrix. Yesterday she appeared
in court to contest .the application made
by H. M. A. MHler and John W. C. Max
well, trustees for the - creditors of the
Progreso Mining Company, to modify
the order made giving them possession ot
all estate papers .that they might secure
the possession of papers relating solely to
the mining properties under their charge.
As the estate of Thomas Bell is on-j-ot
the big creditors of the mining company
Judge Coffey decided that testimony must
be taken before he would permit the re
moval of ' the papers â¢Â«n question. â¢ . Mr.
Miller was called to the stand and went
through the entire history of the Pro
greso mines and told of the manner in
which he came into possession of the pa
pers and documents. : He said that the>
had been in his possession for live years
last past and were not a part of the prop
erties of decedent's estate. Judge Coffey
finally granted the order, providing, how
ever,. that Mrs. Bell be permitted as a
creditor of the company to examine the
papers at any time the court may so or
der. ' -'?-Â¦. ..._-'- Â¦. 'Â¦- '- - -
The effort made by George Staacke to
recover - possession of the letters written
to him by -Laura J. I Thompson was not so
successful. Mrs. Bell claimed -that these
letters- substantiated her charges that
Staacke had committed fraud upon the
estate, and Judge Coffey, although order
ing her to deliver the same to .Staacke,
granted her the right to photograph such
of those as she saw fit or would assist her
in her management of decedent's estate.
As soon as these preliminaries 1 have been
concluded Staacke will be made. to defend
himself . against Mrs. Bell's : charges, and
the proceedings will . doubtless develop

Hints on Pronunciation.
1. We have In French diphthongs as well
as in English. The French diphthongs,
however, are formed and sounded alto
gether differently. A plain rule, therefore,
is that a diphthong is formed in French
by the double vowel â¢ sound,' slightly ex
tended by the last vowel.
The following five diphthongs require
our special attention:
ay sounds like the English ay-ec ln
ayant (having); ayee-yang.
oi sounds like the . English wah, as ln
mlroir (mirror); roeer-wahr. .

Noteâ The student will do well to repeat these
and previous sounds; those of the compound
vowels - and the nasal sounds over and over
again until he is thorouehly familiar with
them.
Every new lesson should be preceded by
a full rehearsal of the entire text and
translation, including the pronunciation,
of all previous ones. Compare eacn trans
lation of the English text with the French
reading exercise, and vice versa. Write It
out again and again until thoroughly fa
miliar with the spelling of words and
construction. To work systematically,
translate the exercise of one language into
the other/and when thoroughly familiar
with both compare according to the text
given in each lesson.
A Pew Things to Remember.
The following will serve as an Incom
plete though as far as possible practical
guide for the gender of feminine nouns.
There is no positive, fixed rule for gen
ders in French. The best and only way
to determine It is to commit each noun to
memory, with its proper article. (See les
son No. 5.) ' " Â¦
. (a) Nouns signifying woman ln all her
conditions are feminine, as
Mother: la mere: mair.
Wife; l'epouse; lay-pooz; (also femme;
fahm.)
Cousin; la couslne; koo-zeen.
(b) Names of females of animals:
Cat; la chatte; shatt.
Ewe; la brebls; breb-ee.
Mare; la Jument: zhuh-mong.
(c) Names of qualities, virtues, vices are
usually feminine, though the word "vice"
(vice) "is masculine and the word "virtue"
(vertu) is feminine.
Beauty; la beaute: boh-tay.
Goodness; la bontÂ£: bong-tay.
Laziness; la paresse: pah-ress.
' Noteâ There are a . few exceptions, however,
to this last rule.
(d) Names of fruits are, with few excep
tions, also feminine:
Cherry; la cerise: say-reez.
Orange; la orange; o-rahnge.
Apple; la pomme: pom.
(c) Nouns ending ln an "c mute are
usually feminine, with but some few ex
ceptions: . . '.
Earth; la terre: tairr.
River; la riviere: ree-vee-air.
Experience; l'experlence; l'ex-pay-ree
ahnce.
Noteâ The proper articles to use with the
above mentioned and all feminine nouns are
la the (Iah): une. one, a or anjoon). Those
: to be u*ed with the masculine nouns given In
lessons 5, and all masculine nouns are: le, the
'Â¦ (luh); un, a, one or an (uhn).

- (Continued.)
The Coherer.
The spark-gap detector used by Hertz
was extremely simple but of lÂ« m^ed sen
sitiveness, failing to respond at distances
greater than about 200 feet. The first
requisite, therefore, to make space teleg
raphy ofV practical value was a detector
which should be reliable and sufficiently
sensitive to respond at a distance of miles
instead of yards. This was found Jn the
â¢"coherer," which has been ascribed to
Branly. though it was knownand used l In
one form or, another long before his
"Wince "thÂ© first use of the- microphone as
a telephone transmitter the fact was well
known that a simple microphone contact,
like the Blake, If the; prints were both
made of metal, becams, faintly welded to
gether under the action of the current;
and this, a defect ln a telephone, was one
of, the principal reasons , for the use .of
carbon. A single metallic contact of this
sort is the form of coherer which has been
used by Lodge. Hughes noticed this pe
culiar sensitiveness of a microphonlc con
tact., either single or multiple, to a dis
charge through it. and the same effect
appears to have been observed by others.
Onesti," however/ seems to have been the
first to make: use of this property, and
Branly Increased the sensitiveness of the
coherer by modifications in: the design.
As at present used the coherer consists of
a small glass - tube â¢in which â¢ metallic
pistons fit tightly. The space between
theÂ°e pistonsâ one-twentieth to one-quar
ter of an" Inchâ ls filled somewhat loosely
with * filings - of ; metal. The : ends of the
pistons are smeared .with mercury, and
the filings, which mustjie sharp, are
worked up with a little!\nercnry^for the
best results. " In addition to this Marconi
has used coherers in which the space be
.tween the pistons Is practically, or wholly
exhausted of air. Filings. of any metal
will work, but . the best results are ob
tained- with : a mixture :of about . 96 per
cent nickel and 4 per cent silver. .The
tightness with which they are packed in
the tube must be ' carefully adjusted by
moving the ? pistons- , .
â¢ .'Action ' of Coherer.
When' a discharge, of electricity passes
through the mass of filings, which are or
dinarily in no particular arrangement, but
lying In random : positions, the filings ' at
once marshal themselves in regular order,
point to point.' and the chains thus estab
lished are made more perfect by the slight
welding^ action; at the; contact.' The ;â¢ re
sistance of the mass of filings, .which be
fore was infinite," becomes finiteâ from 100
ohms to 500 ohmsâ and . if . a ' battery. Is in
connection ; with : the ' coherer -a - current
may ; be ' made to pass and actuate â¢: a
P The cause of this behavior of the filing?
Is - probably.' the well-known action * of , a
t tatlc ' change;-, which ; is .' most intense tat
sharp * points. t ; : Each V individual:.; filing,
therefore, is most intensely and oppositely
charged Â» by, induction . at opposite points,
and < each , positively^ charged point is \ at
' traded * to - the I negatively | charged | point
of a! neighboring filing." ".- As : soon , as : con
tact Â¦ occurs : the Â¦ charge ; passes â¢ and â¢ welds
the points, i the whole - action "â¢ being - prac
tically Instantaneous.,.' , : . * '
"To . restore the coherer to its sensitive
condition these welds must b# broken.
This is actually accomplished by causing
the tongue of a vibrator or buzzer to tap
the tube and shake up the filings. The
fame thing may be effected by rotating
the coherer or by placing it in a rapidly
alternating magnetic field. Â¦
Sensitiveness of the Coherer.
The extraordinary sensitiveness of the
coherer may be dimly appreciated when
the conditions under which it works are
known. It has been computed by Abbott
that, working at a distance of thirty-five
milesâ lt has responded .to more than
twice â¢ that distance â the coherer has an
efficiency of only one five hundred-mil
lionth of 1 per cent. That is. It uses only
one fifty-billionth of the energy put In at
the transmitting end. Even then the sen
sitiveness will probably be increased.
Marconi's System.
The simplest form of transmitting de
vice consists of an induction coil 'or
other ' alternator, with spark gap ln the
secondary and battery and key in the pri
mary. Â¦ '-When the key is closed a stream
of sparks passes across the gap, setting
up corresponding ether waves which ra
diate ln all directions and are detected by
the receiving apparatus. *
The spark gap may be simple or a
Righl oscillator may. be used, in which
two larger brass balls, very close to
gether, are placed between the terminal
balls of the coil.
â¢To send these waves ln any particular
direction: a. parabolic reflector of metal Is
so placed that the spark gap Is at the
focus and the open side of the reflector
points in the desired direction. So far as
has yet been announced, . no distance
greater than two miles has been covered
by the use of reflectors. The receiver, for
directed waves has a similar reflector
with the coherer ln the focus, and neither
transmitter nor receiver is connected with
a vertical wIre.3MOMkMMMsW
In the method by which the greatest
success has been attained, however. Mar
coni "uses a vertical wire of height ad
justed to the distance over which the sig
nals are to be sent. One side of the spark
gap. ls connected to the vertical wire, the
other to earth.~J^BWWÂ»i**4BS3BÂ«ftHÂ»*Â«S > "'W
The receiver, circuit In less simple. One
side of the coherer Is connected to the ver
tical wire, the other side to earth: and the
coherer is also included in the circuit of
a local battery and sensitive relay..
y .,When â¢ a discharge passes through the
coherer. Its resistance is -so- far lowered
that the local battery actuates the' relay.
This, mi turn. '.closes Â¦ another circuit" In
which is a Morse recorder or. other regis
tering instrument." ..The tapper is also con
nected, in Uhis second local: circuit and
keeps up its Â¦ hammering â¢ on : the Â¦ coherer
so long as the discharge ia passing. Every
contact Is shunted by a non-lnductlve re-,
slstance to prevent sparking. <mCMM
"Thai light. armature of the relay is In
more or less continuous vibration, but the
heavy armature of the Morse Instrument
does not respond so quickly and remains
down ' as â¢ long as the transmitting : key Is
closed, recording the regular Morse char
acters. Jl >WTfcrii'y*TTtfflflTlli JI lUstfÃiwlUlfl

NAVAL RESERVE
BOAT MARION TO
BE OVERHAULED
Went to Navy-Yard Yester
day in Tow of State Tug
Governor Markliamr
â 0 *
Benmohr and A. 6. Ropes in Colli-
sion â Ship Edward Sewall Ea
ters Montevideo in Dis
tress.
The naval reserve steamer Marion went
to the Mare Island navy yard yesterday.
Ever since she was turned : over by. the
Navy Department to â¢ the State ' she had
J>een either out in the bay or alongside
Howard street wharf. Barnacles gath
ered on her from the keel to the water
line, untllnow It is almost impossible to
get her through the water. A few, Sun
days ago, when a cruise around the bay
i was In. order. Captain W. T. James found
that the old sloop-of- war's bottom was so
foul that a speed of five knots an hour
could not be obtained.. He notified . the
Secretary of the Navy of the state of af
fairs and yesterday at 10 a. m. a tele
gram came ordering the Marlon to be at
Mare Island at 10 p. m. yesterday ln order
, to be ready to enter the navy yard dry
dock on this morning's tide. '
As soon as Captain James got the dis
patch he went to the Harbor Commis
sioners and those gentlemen at once
placed the State tug Governor Markham
at his disposal. Then he had to get a
â¢ crew together, but this also proyed an
easy job. . At 2 p. m: the Marion was
hove short and a few minutes later the
Governor Markham went alongside. It
was some time before the tug and her
tow got under way, however, as the Ma
rlon's anchor was foul and had to be
cleared. . - '.
The Marion was recently inspected by
Commander Drake under orders from the
Navy Department, and he sent a long re
port to Washington dealing with her con
dition and making recommendations for
changes and additions to her. All of .these
were on small matters, however, for the
Government cannot afford to spend much
money on the old ship. . It Is in her engi
neers' department where most of tne
work will be needed, but it is quite,, possi
ble to put her engines -in fair, condition
at small cost. It is probable that some
of the repairs suggested by Commander
Drake will be made on the vessel before
she leaves the island again.
While the Marlon was being got ready
for her trip to the navy yard the tide
was running like a mlllrace. The ship A.
G. Ropes began to drag and for a few
minutes it looked as though she would
drift down on the naval reserve boat. She
took a sheer, however, and ranged up
alongside the British steamer Benmohr.
The tug Liberty and Sea King came along
Just in time and separated the vessels be
fore much damage was done. The Ropes
is in ballast and was lying in the stream
awaiting a crew in order to start for Ho
nolulu to load sugar for New York.
The new steel ship Edward Sewall is in
Montevideo in distress. She is on her
"maiden" from Baltimore for San Fran
cisco, and the dispatch to the Merchants'
Exchange says that the. cargo of coal
heated. The Edward Sewall is a sister
ship to the Arthur Sewall and Erskine M.
Phelps.
The transport Columbia Is on the dry
dock getting a thorough overhauling pre
paratory to her cruise to Cape Nome with
soldiers. Captain Dobson will remain ln
command and Purser Robinson will have
charge of the ship's treasury. Both gen
tlemen have made enviable records foi
themselves while ln a private capacity in
the transport service to Manila.
The transport Grant sails for Manila on
April 1. the Hancock, with the Philippine
Commission, on April 16, and the Warren
on May 1. The Badger, as soon as she is
turned over to the transport service, will
be made into a first-class . hospital ship,
while the Missouri will be made into a
freight boat. The Warren was to have
been thoroughly overhauled and made
Into a model troop ship, but the work will
not now be done until she comes back
from Manila. â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ' '. Â¦ - â¢
The Kimball Steamship Company will
not have its fine, palatial steamer John S.
Kimball ready for the first rush to Nome.
The vessel was to have been ready to have
gone into commission on the 15th lnst., but
as she was not launched until that/ day
it Â¦will be impossible to get her ready for
sea before June next. Quite a number of
people were booked to sail on the Kim
ball, but the company at once notified the
passengers of the delay and offered them
the return of their. money or passage on
the steamers Sequoia. Albion or Aloha. In
every Instance the offer was accepted, and
the vessels named will go out with every
passenger they can carry- The Albion
will sail Aprtl 25, the Aloha May 10 and
the Sequoia May 15. '
The steamer Czarina is now loading gen
eral merchandise at Pacific-street wharf
for Honolulu. She will probably get away
early to-morrow, as all her cargo is : en
gaged. The Czarina has been put. on to
"help out," as a number of the Spreckels
sailing fleet have been sold recently and
the new vessels are not ready to go on
the run.
The Annie Thcmas, now out 241 days
from Cardiff for Acapulco. went to 85 per
cent, and the Henry Clement. 241 days out
from Hamburg to China, to. 30 per cent
yesterday. The Lydgate, on which 15 per
cent was paid, arrived at Shanghai yes
terday.
Just before the old Professor Morse was
condemned, in 1898, Captain Fisher tried
to buy the engines. of the Eastern Oregon
for her. When the Inspectors refused to
pa"Â«s the hull he proposed to dismantle her
and tow her to Seattle as a hulk. On the
Sound, he confidently asserted, he could
get a license for her. Even as a hulk the
Inspectors refused to . allow, her to leave
port, Â¦ but it now appears that Captain
Fisher and Captain Handy secured some
body ln Seattle to put $10,000 into the
wreck.

..The fact, ls not generally known 'Â¦ and
appreciated that candidates for Congress
must be nominated by conventions chosen
under the provisions of the primary elec

expect to take an active part in the next
campaign are impressed with the idea
that the conventions chosen to select dele

at Philadelphia June 19 may at the direc

mittees t go further and: place in the field

. Voters should clearly understand that
the election "laws were amended at the
last regular session of the Legislature in
1599, and the old custom concerning Con
gressional nominations cannot be ., ob
served. A candidate cannot have his name
printed on the " official ballot unless he is
the nominee . of a convention chosen as
the law requires. Moreover, the election
of delegates to such . convention must.be
held on the second Tuesday of August. .â

PRIMARY ELECTION SHALL BE
HELD ON THE SECOND TUESDAY
OF AUGUST, AND AT NO OTHER
TIME.
v Under the reform ballot law as adopted
in IS9I, and amended from time to time, a
convention : whose nominees might be
placed â¢ on ; the ; ofllcial ballot : was . defined
as an organized assemblage of delegates
representing^ a political party,, which at
the last. election polled at least 3 per cent
of the -entire -vote 'of -the State, county,
district or political division. This provi
sion whs contained in section 1186 of the
Political Code. This section was amend
ed by., the , Legislature - of . 1599 .so as to
conform to the primary election law, and
a convention is now defined:
"As an organized assemblage of
delegates - elected by ballot at a pri
mary election and representing a po
litical party, which cast three per cent
of the votes," etc.
The effect of this amendment, taken ln
connection with the primary election law,
is to absolutely require that all delegates
to nominating conventions shall be elected
under the primary election law.
" Section 13C7 of the primary, election law
defines conventions ~ to nominate candi
dates for Congress as distinct conventions.
â¢ If is left,' under, the provisions of sec
tion 1370, v with the , Congressional district
committees to elect whether the delegates
elected under the primary election law to
the State convention shall nominate Con
gressmen, or '.whether separate delegates
shall be elected in such .Congressional dis
tricts for that purpose. Â¦ \ .
If the Congressional district committee
decides : that a - separate â¢ convention ; shall
be assembled, to be composed of delegates
other than those elected from ; the district
to the State convention, notice of such de
cision must -be given to â¢ the Secretary of
State forty days prior. to the primary, elec
tion.. â¢ If : such â¢ steps ! as the law Â¦ provides
for â¢' a separate convention : are not taken
by the Congressional district 'Â¦ committee,
then I the delegates i chosen; on the second
Tuesday of August to i represent the dis
trict in the State ; convention must nom
inate the 'Â¦ candidate â¢ for; Congress. These
provisions i are ? made: applicable -toto t the
nomination of candidates for the Railroad
Commission and State Board of Equalisa
1 The primary election law. does not rec
ognize - proxies. A delegate to â¢ a
convention is a commissioned I officer, c and
therefore 'Â¦ cannot ; appoint > another : person
to perform his official duties. -,
I There Will be Congressional District con
ventions i and a , State convention ; in i May
next ' to ; choose : delegates , to i the â¢ Republi
can National I Convention Â¦at s Philadelphia
on June 19. :<Men elected to comprise these
earl y conventions may Â¦ Indorse,- commend
or -/criticize Â¦ . Congressional aspirants fto
their ' hearts' content,' but they ; cannot Â¦ do
more :than: suggest' candidates.;' Nomina
tiors can only â¢be â¢ lawf ull y Â¦Â¦ made , by i con
ventions chosen on the second .Tuesday of
August r under ' the -provisions of the pri
mary; election' law. 1 ;-- . , " Â¦Â¦- Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦"-Â¦.:Â¦Â¦Â¦. Â»
One thing canÂ»now be [done I to -, the ad
vantage Of the Republican party, and that
is active work In the cause of, registration,
so * that every " person j entitled \ to :-: cast a
ballot 5 at" the Â¦ November; election I and : the
August primary s, may be , properly -? regis

taking was overwhelmed" by .: new buying,
which New York assisted by very early buying
of Baltimore and Ohio: New â¢ York realized ;on
the advance at the opening; but offering sup
port In the street, which boomed at top prices.
Baltimore and Ohio was the chief 'feature, but
th*rÂ» was also blgr buying of t Southern Â¦ Rail
way on a house tip. Tlhtos were C 6%;; closing
at 60%. and there is talk of 60 to 70 for them.
The earnings since October ' are said to war
rant the expectation of a .five-pound ; dividend
i.ext year. New York bought "Anacondas
fxeoly. .
The .war, loan was 'easier at 2V4 premium.
The bank got Â£84,000 In gold : from Holland,
Â£10.000 from Australia and Â£10,000- In bars.
Rates for call money Â¦ and fixtures '.were : un
changed, and they were In good demand. All
loans due the banks' were 'renewed, and there
was considerable fresh borrowing. Bills* were
very firm.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 26.â T0-day's stock mar
ket made a remarkable demonstration of
strength In the prices of securities and of
absorptive power in the face of the enormous
liquidation of profits. Sharp reactions from
best prices were made in many stocks and
others which have been the recent favorites
among speculators lor a rise were heavy on
realizing of profits throughout the day, but
the general level of prices was decidedly higher
on the day and a very heavy aggregate of
nocks was marketed. The dealings were more
or less coEÂ£es>ted in the leaders of Stuck Ex
change movements, but there was a very broad
market for usually dormant stocks, some of
which have not made their appearance In the
records of transactions for many weeks past.
London waa an eager buyer In this market
and while there were sales for that account
to take profits where recent advances have
been considerable, the disposition of the for
eigners seemed to be to reinvest their profits
in other Â«ti>cks. They were free sellers of
Norfolk and Western and of Baltimore and
Ohio, but the purchases on London account
far outbalanced the saies. It was estimated
that London bought fully 60,000 shares on bal
ance, principally among the low-priced com
mon btocks, with preferred stock ahead of
them. The coninnscion houses had large orders
tci buy which had accumulated over Sunday,
Â£.nd the pruiessionals took advantage of this
oemand to market their holdings. This, coupled
with the weakness of local traction stocks,
tsuKar and People's Gas. turned -prices back
l*>iore the end of the first hour, but the buy-
Ing continued in unabated volume and carried
the market upward at-air.. Later in the day,
when the buying orders had been executed and
realizing developed in the trunk lines, the
maiket went on* again. The final rally did
not bring iirii'tii back to the bt-st, but it made
the i:Â«>.-:::k firm. 13altimoie and Ohio com
mon rusr an extreme b\ and at one time
crossed the preferred. There was very heavy
realizing in the uther trunk lines under cover
of the rise in Baltimore and Ohio. Special
etrcnglh and act.vity were shown by a number
of the low -priced Southern and South wetterns,
the Pacifies, tome of the coolers, both an
thracite and bituminous. The news of the
day did not receive much attention, the move
neat apparently being based on confidence In
the general outlook for business and values
fejid ::: future ease in the money market. All
departments of the local money market were
appreciably easier to-day in spite .of the largely
ln'.-reaiwd Kpecuiutive activity and the result
ing demand for funds. In Fpite of the large
buying of stocks for London account sterling
exchange advanced a fraction, apparently in
response to the hardening of money rates in
London. A marked falling off was reported In
the quantity of cotton bills offered in the ex
change market.
The bond market continued broad and active
a&d ' higher prices were made for most bond;
traded ill. 'loud feales, par value. (4,810,000.

CHICAGO. March' 26.â The corn market early
assumed a commanding air on the floor of the
exchange and held It by virtue of its strength
and activity, from which other pits were glad
to bcrrow. Wet weather in the West and
small stocks were the only available reasons
to account for the advance from a statistical
standpoint. The buying by a coterie of bulls,
who gave no reasons, was an Influence of im
portance. May opened a shade over Saturday
at 37%@ 37 7 <iC and In the course of ' an hour
had reached 3S%c. The bulge met with heavy
profit-taking, but the price was holding fairly
well until Western reports showed May re
ceips segregating 1.152.000 bushels. An explan
ation of this deluge of corn was that it was
being rushed in to take advantage of the low
rates to the Missouri River, which : expire
April 10. May eased off to 38% c and closed
strone. Â«t^y.c over Saturday.
WHEAT â The strength of corn wu suffi
cient to pull the wheat market away from the
bearish clutch of the big Increases afloat and
in world's shipments, but- the downward ten
dency of the market took the fullest advan
tage of the reaction In corn and closed weak.
Cables were firm, but the export demand was
not very encouraging. Provisions as well as
corn were some support. May opened a shade
over Saturday at 65%Â®65%c, touched 65% c and
then advanced with provisions as the guid
ing factor to 66% c. Primary receipts were large
and this fact with the reaction in corn caused
a decline and the close was %c under Satur
day at 65% c. *
The provision market was active and strong,
helped by the corn strength to Â¦ a degree, but
chiefly by the light offerings, which greeted a
large, general demand. The opening was a
shade to 2%c . under Saturday In sympathey
with weaker prices at the yards, but the de
pression . was only for a moment. May pork
closed 20c up. May lard 6c higher and May
ribs 7% l SlOc Improved.
The trade In oats was not of Importance,
but the market held firmly In sympathy with
corn. The discount between ,oats and corn
at one time was 14<~c. May closed unchanged.

NOTED RABBI PASSES
TO THE GREAT BEYOND
Dr. Isaac M. Wise, a Leader of; the
Bef ormed Jewish Church, Suc
cumhs to Paralysis.
CINCINNATI, March 26.-Rabbi Isaao
M. Wise, probably the most distinguished
rabbi in the Reformed Jewish Church,
died this evening at 6 o'clock of a stroke
of paralysis, which made its first appear
ance last Saturday evening.
Dr. Wise was born in Stelngrub, Bo
hemia, April 3, 1819. He was educated at
Prague University and graduated at a
Hebrew theological . college. He spent
some time at Vienna in study. In 1546
he came to Albany, N. V., and took
charge of a congregation. It was - this
congregation that made the first reform
movement in Judaism in America, j Dr.
Wise led the reformers and the congre
gation divided.
For some time the doctor engaged in
various occupations, part of the time li
brarian in Albany and Â¦ in other occupa
tions, until 1854, when he started the pub
lication of the American Israelite and
Die Beborah, in which he continued as
editor until his death. Dr. AVlse was a
very public-spirited citizen. He always
took <rreiit interest in educational matters
and for many years was an active trustee
of Cincinnati University. He was- the
president and the founder of the Hebrew
Union College and was also the organ
izer of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.
In 1Â»89 the Central Conference of
American Rabbis met ,Â¦ in conven
tion at Boston. Â¦ Dr. Wise was president
of this conference, an â¢office which his
death makes vacant. As a special mark
of honor to Rabbi Wise this conference
met at Cincinnati last year on his eight
ieth birthday instead of at Boston. Tho
bronze bust which the conference re
solved. to present to Dr. Wise is now in
process of construction at Rome, Italy,
by Sculptor Moses Ezeklel. ' Â¦

The Police' Commissioners as a pension
body met yesterday afternoon and consid

Attorney* Joseph Dunne appeared for tho
petitioners. He made an extended argu
ment, citing tha law on the subject, and
concluded by asking the Commissioners to
have the names of Tobln and Alvord en
rolled on the pension list.
Their application wai opposed by Wil

them as being among the wealthiest men
In the city, and announced that In casa
they were allowed pensions he would take
the matter Into the courts. At the sug

WHEELER NOT TO
MAKE ANY VERY
RADICAL CHANGES
President of the University
Only to Enlarge De
partments.
Four Professors Are Away, Howison
and Putzker in Europe, Bradley
Visiting Schools and Moses
Goes to Manila.
BERKELEY, March 26.â President
Wheeler of the University of California
has announced that he will make recom
mendations for a number cf appointments
for positions in the faculty at the next
meeting of the Board of Kegents in May.
No changes are contemplated in the heads
of the departments at this time and only
instructors and thof* for lower positions
Â¦will be nominated. President Wheeler will
not make any radical changes In the
faculty at this time.
Dr. Whteler says that he will probably
go East again shortly in quest of such
material as may be necessary for the new
university. Some of the departments must
be enlarged and new men will be brought
htire from other places. There will be
no general shake-up la the faculty at this
time, however. Regarding the matter Dr.
Wheeler said:
"I do not know of any changes to be
made in the faculty other than the regu
lar yearly appointments. At the next
regular meeting of the Board of Regents
in May I will maiie recommendations for
appointments. That will not affect the
faculty In any way except, perhaps, some
cf the minor positions. The instructors
arÂ« appointed for one year and must be
appointed in May of each year. .If we did
not do that we could not conduct the next
term's work properly.
"As to the displacing of some of the
professors 1 know nothing. There are
only four profe-esors away at this time-
Professors Moses. Bradley, Howlson and
Putzker. Professors Putzker and Howi
son are on regular furloughs. Professor
Bradley is examining schools.
"As to Professor Moses his case has not
been discussed. He has been appointel
to the Philippine Commission and un
doubtedly will not be here the whole of
next year. There are many others in the
various departments who can temporarily
fill these vacancies very well."

Institute was delivered last evening by
Rev. Father Joseph Sasla. S. J., in Met
ropolitan Temple. His subject was
"Catholicism . and Human Destiny" or
"The True Solution of the Greatest Prob
lem of Life."
The mystery of the hereafter the
speaker believed to be the great ques
tion, and he reasoned that the solution
of that question lay in the decision of
who or what had the right to interpret
the revelations and promises of God. It
is unreasonable, he said, to believe that
the interpretation of the word of God had
been left to the caprice of mankind.
There must be some authority direct from
the Master, and this authority, he said,
lay in the Catholic church. He quoted
the words of Christ to Peter when he
told the apostle he would abide by his
church forever, and from this he argued
that the Catholic church was the true
authority to interpret the revelations of
the Lord concerning the life beyond the
grave. There Is no other church or so
ciety, he -said, that has such a promise,
and unless the words be taken as an Idle
boast they must be accepted to mean that
for all time Christ has constituted the
Catholic church as his own.
The history of the Catholic church, he
continued, has been the struggle for ex
istence and the survival of the fittest.
For ISOO years it has flourished through
all vicissitudes and against, all opposing
forces, bearing out the promise of Christ
that the "gates of hell would not pre
vail" against her.
The speaker argued that the body as
well as the soul would share in the after
life, for revelation Included both the body
and the soulâ the soul to seek its reward
at once, the body , to remain until the
Judgment day, when all would rise from
the dead in their own form, to be Judged
as they should merit. He quoted from in
fidel and agnostic writers and authorities
and compared the promise they held out
to the promise of the church. -He com
pared their state of doubt and indecision
to the certainty of the promises of God,
and he summed up their state of mind
in the prayer of the little agnostic: "O
God (if there be a God), have mercy on

FAILURE OF
NATIONAL BANK
AT RUTLAND
Cashier Arrested on Charge
of Misappropriating
Funds.
RUTLAND, Vt.. March 26.â With its
doors closed fast and Its cashier, Charles
W. Mussey, In jail, a defaulter for $154,000,
the Merchants' National Bank of this
city, formerly one of the strongest Insti
tutions in the State, stands to-night on
the verge of ruin, unless Its stockholders
come to Its assistance and help the re
maining assets to pay off the $351,000 due
its depositors.
Mussey confessed his guilt to the entire
board of directors, having come back
from Albany at the solicitation of a local
detective, who traoed him to that city
when he failed to appear before his em
ployers Saturday afternoon. He remained
in close detention all day, practically un
der arrest in a civil suit brought by the
bank for $50,000, but to-night the United
States authorities after an examination
into the bank's affairs, formally arrested
him on a charge of - embezzlement and
lodged him in the County Jail. It Is un
derstood that the United States Circuit
Court has placed his bail at $100,000.
Coincident with Mussey's confession
came the closing of the. music store of H.
A. McClure Jr., tho business of which, ac
cording to the confession of the cashier,
has been supported wholly or in part by
the funds of the bank. Mussey's pecula
tions began six years ago, and were so
well covered up that the national bank ex
aminer was deceived by the cashier up
to only a few months ago, the entire de
ficit being made to appear good through
a large number of forged notes which
Mussey inserted.
The inevitable day arrived last Satur
day, when Mussey was called before the
board and asked for the bank's ' assets.
Mussey put on a bold face and at once of
fered to go across the street to the safe
deposit vaults for the securities. The di
rectors waited an hour for him and then
sent for a-detectlve.
The cashier went from the bank to his
house, where he took a few hundred dol
lars and left the city. The detectives
caught up with him yeuterday in Albany
and persuaded him to return without ex
tradition papers. . Â¦ .-. ; -
Late this afternoon Bank Examiner D.
D. Muir was appointed temporary receiver
of the bank. Â¦ â¢ V
The closing of McClure's music store
accounted for part of Mussey's shortage,
but it is generally admitted here that the
store has been run on far less than $145,
000 during the past six yearÃ. > Many per
sons found themselves unable to | recon
cile Mussey's statement Â¦ that the money
had gone into the business, 'the volume of
which was known.* Explanations are
looked for within a few days. :
KEENE. N. H., March 26.â The Bank
Commissioners for New Hampshire have
filed a petition with the Clerk of the
Cheshire County Supreme Court, asking
that an assignee be appointed for the

for the Keene Five Cents Savings Bank.
The finances of both these institutions
have been considered uncertain for some
time, and neither bank has revel ved de
posits of â¢ late, owing to a â¢ general | belief
that they had sustained I losses through
Western investments. -

HOUSE DISCUSSES THE
ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL
Cox Declares if He Had His Way Not
a Dollar Should Be Spent
Fighting Filipinos.
WASHINGTON, March 26.â The House
entered upon the consideration of the
army appropriation bill, but the debate
was without exciting Incident, being con
fined to the discussion of army matters.
Chairman Hull, in charge of the bill, ex
plained its provisions. Jett of Illinois
criticized the policy of rushing officers
through the high grades of the army Just
prior to retirement. Cox of Tennessee
and Rldgeley of Kansas opposed generally
a permanent increase of the army aa pre
judicial to the best interests of the coun
try and Meyer of Louisiana discussed the
Philippine policy, opposing the retention
of the islands.
Cox of Tennessee introduced the Philip
pine question into the debate, criticiz
ing the policy of the administration In
using the army to put down the insur
rection there and announcing that If he
could have his way not one dollar should
be voted to subjugate the Filipinos. The
soldiers serving in the Philippines he ac
quitted of all blame. They were doing
their duty and deserved well of their
country. The fault lay with those who
had inaugurated the unholy war. Cox
predicted that not In the memory of the
man now living would the army ever get
back to Its peace footing of 25,000. When
he came to Congress the appropriations
for the army were $20,000,000. Last year
they were $120,000,000.

tion of the Philippine Islands, but if they
were to be retained he argued that Amer
ican products should be protected against
free competition from products of the
Island. His remarks had not been com
pleted when the House adjourned.

CLEVER FORGER
GRIMMELL HAS A
TOUGH RECORD
Through His Smooth Work
He Has Easily Victim
ized Many People.
Glib of Tongue, He Plied His Voca
tion in All the Large Cities and
"No Favorites" Was His
Motto.
>
Edward Grimmell, the forger of checks
on the United States medical disbursing
department, was subjected to the sweat
ing process yesterday by United States
Secret Service Inspector Hazen in the
Appraiser's building, and practically re
peated the confession of his guilt he had
made to the Federal officials In the East.
This morning Assistant United States At
torney Banning will ask Judge de Haven
for the appointment of a new Federal
Grand Jury and Grimmell's case will be
laid before them.
Grlmmell's career of crime is a long
one and commenced when he was an un
dergraduate at Washington, D. C, where
he was convicted of fraud and sentenced
to the penitentiary for three years. On
his release from â¢ prison he came to San
Francisco, enlisted in the army and went
to the Philippines. On account of his
knowledge or drugs he was given a good
position in the hospital service and on
his return to San Francisco secured em
ployment in the medical supply depart
ment. His money melted rapidly in an
endeavor to win a 'stake at the Ingleslde
races and to make good his losses ne did
what many other trusted employes hayÂ«
done before him, committed crimes and
after retting beyond hope of recovery de
faulted.
When the police were looking for Grim
mell in British Columbia he was forging
checks in Eastern citiea. At Chicago he
victimized his father's frlend-and forged
his name to a check which was honored
and then he skipped to new fields. Four
hundred dollars were added to the swind
ler's funds in Cleveland, where with the
ever-ready pen he forged the Indorsement
of a college professor to a worthless ctleck
and cashed It.
It Is related of Grimmell that he formed
the acquaintance of a revivalist at a
church meeting in an Eastern city and
pretending, to seek religion he allowed his
story to be drawn from him of his being
agent for a large drug house which had
heavy contracts with the Government and
endeavored to have his new-found friend
cash a Government check for him. On
his refusal Grimmell passed the matter
carelessly, but continued his visits to the
revival meetings. The old man was an
officer of the church and passed the con
tribution plate. Into which Grimmell
would always drop a sum much larger
than the other contributors. He finally
won the old man over and did the grace
ful by giving him a worthless check in
exchange for $400.
Grimmell haa worked many places, his
smooth, glib way making it an easy oper
ation to land a victim. It 13 estimated
that he has in all cashed over $20,000
worth of forged checks, and if he had not
fallen into the hands of the secret service
agents in Philadelphia there is no telling
to what extent he would have plied his
smooth work.

to be in a very serious condition. '.but his

GERMAN EMBASSADOR
TO RUSSIA MAY RESIGN
Possible Action That May Come as
the Result of a Joke at a
Recent Balli
Special Dispatch to The Call.
/ NEW YORK, March 26.â A dispatch to
the London Dally News from Berlin says
that a story of a quarrel, which may pos
sibly end in the resignation of Prince yon
Radolin, German Embassador to Russia,
comes from St. Petersburg. The story Is
that at the last ball of the season, in the
pavilion hall of the Hermitage, Grand
Duke Vladimir was about to take a lady
to supper when . he was ' told that jit | had
been arranged that she should be taken in
by a member of the German i embassy.
The Grand Duke thereupon humorously
assured the lady that there was nothing
slower than a German diplomat.
. The remark was made loudly and Jovi
ally and was repeated about the room. It
finally reached , Prince yon Radolin In a
distorted form and he took the Incom
prehensible step of complaining to Grand
Duke Vladimir's wife, who is a Princess
of Mecklenburg, concerning her husband's
joke. Prince yon Radolin received a re
buff, whereupon he informed Count Mura
vleff, the Russian Minister of Foreign
Affairs,- who tried to adjust the trouble.
He requested the Embassador to apolo
gize to Grand Duchess Marie, Vladimir's
wife, who apparently - was very angry
with Prince yon Radolin. - . . ' . . ,:â¢'''â¢'
The Grand Duchess refused to accept an
apology, and ' declared that! she did not
wish to see Prince yon Radolln again,
adding that she intended to .avoid all bo
dety where he would be present, s
It is generally presumed In court circles
that the Embassador will soon leave. The
German Foreign Office has caused an
inspired paragraph to be printed declar
ing that rumors of Prince yon Radolln's
resignation are utterly unfounded. The
correspondent admits that the story needs
confirmation.

HASTINGS, Nebr., March 26.â The fea
ture of the Horlocker-Morey poisoning
case to-day was the appearance of Miss
Horlocker on the stand. She was greatly

Morey called on her at the Blue River
resort three times &nd that at one time
when Mrs. Morey was away from home
she at Morey's solicitation, accompanied
him to his room.
Miss Horlocker protested, however, that
there was at no time any immoral rela
tions between them. She also identified
a locket containing Morey's picture and a
lock of his hair which she had worn next
to her heart. At times Miss Horlocker
found it well nigh impossible to answer
the questions put to her, burying her head
in her hands and sobbing aloud.
Depositions of insanity experts were
also read. In which the opinion was ex
pressed that the defendant was insane
when she sent Mrs. Morey the candy.

Teeth Made From Paper.
Teeth of papier mache are the latest in den
tistry. By a peculiar process they are rendered
better than; any other material. Paper teeth
may be fine, but we will venture that most
people prefer their own, and this may. best be
accomplished by keeping the stomach healthy
with Hostetter's Stomach Bitter*. The condi
tion of the. Stomach Invariably affects the
teeth. The Bitters will strengthen your stom
ach, cure dyspepsia and biliousness.

REV. T. H. GILBERT WILL
PROBABLY BE DISMISSED
Bishop Moreland Discusses His Case
With the 'Â¦Â¦ Vestrymen of the
Church at Red Bluff.
RED BLUFF, March 26.â Bishop More
land- met with ' the -vestrymen of the
Episcopalian church here to-day and dis
cussed with them charges preferred lately
against Rev. T. H. Gilbert, formerly rec
tor of this church, of certain Immoral
conduct. The Bishop stated that Gilbert
had been allowed time to bring a civil ac
tion against those charging him and that
the time would elapse this week, and If
no action" were taken he would probably
be dismissed from the ministry.
The Bishop said that he did not think
that the people would be satisfied with a
trial in the ecclesiastical courts, hence
his dismissal would be necessary- Mr.
Gilbert, it Is understood, made threats of
a libel suit if 'forced to leave Red Bluff,
but since his departure so much new evi
dence has come to light that he is prob
ably content to let matters be a3 they are
at present. : .Â¦ -_.' - 'Â¦ ; Â¦

BITTER CONTEST
BETWEEN UNCLE
AND A NEPHEW
Controversy Over the Estate
of Emma Davis Grows
Interesting.
Edmund W. Davis Says His Uncle
Squandered an Allowance and
Is Unfit to Administer
on the Estate.
Â¦Â¦ Â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ :Â¦-'-. 111S Broadway, March -26.
A bitter contest over the estate of Mrs.
Emma C. Davis Is promised between a
nephew and an uncle.
To-day Edmund Watson Davis, grand
son of Mrs. Davis, filed written objections
to the appointment of .his uncle, Fred A,
Davis, as executor of the will. *. : Â¦
Fred A. Davis 'was recently appointed
special administrator of the $10,000 estate
on the strength of a showing that the tes
tratrlx's, property : needed Immediate and
special care. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.. / . ,
: . In his opposition and petition for letters
with the will annexed Edmund W. Davis
alleges that his uncle "Fred" is Â¦ "unflt to
act as executor because of his dissipation,
improvidence and want of ' integrity" ;
that Fred A. Davis for the past five years
has been addicted to the use of intoxicat
ing drinks to an extent that it unfits him
for business. Â¦
The nephew further alleges In his ob
jection and petition that his uncle, by un
due Influence, obtained $2000 from Mrs.
Emma Davis while she was feeble from
old age and- illness, and which he squan
dered in riotous living. He asserts finally
that, his uncle "removed from this county
valuable personal property belonging to
the estate,. which he is keeping concealed.
When the case comes to trial some inter
esting developments are expected.

LITTLE CHILD
ACCIDENTALLY
TAKES POISON
Swallows a Grain or More
of Deadly Bichloride
of Mercury.
â ?
BÂ«scued From Almost Certain Death
Through the Quick Witted
Efforts of Druggist
Waller.
Pearl Eatran, the IS-months-old child of
James Eagan of 611% Minna street, swal
lowed a grain or more of bichloride of mer
cury last night, and would have died but
for the quick work of Druggist J. L-
Waller of 131 Seventh street. It was 7
o'clock when the child took the terrible
poison and the frantic mother ran with
her to the drugstore. Dr. X. Dodel was
Fummoned. and upon his arrival three
quarters of an hour later expressed the
opinion that the case was hopeless. The
druggist refused to give up, however, and
by 10 o'clock had so far succeeded in his
efforts that Dr. Dodel thought the child
would pull through. *~r.\i
The mercury compound which the child
took was in tablet form, each tablet con
taining one grain of the deadly poison.
The tablets were in a plain pill box
marked "poison." and were gtven to the
father. James Eagan. at the Southern
Pacific Railroad Hospital gome months
ago when he was being treated there for
a smashed finger in which blood poison
ing had set In. The surgeon did not tell
him the nature of the poison, and that
carelessness nearly cost Baby Eagan's
Eagan had Just stepped out of the
house, leaving the baby playing on the
floor. The child discovered the white tab
lets on the floor, the box having fallen
from the mantel and broken open. No
one has any idea how many she took.
Mr*. Eapan he-ard the baby scream, took
in the situation at a glance, and- seizing
the child In her arms, ran to the drug
fctore. half a block away. -
Druggist Waller was. at first' at-loss to
know what antidote to give, but after a
few experiments with the tablets that re
mained, discovered the presence of mer
cury and then knew what to do. . Dr.
Dodel said that a delay of ten minutes In
Kit-Ing the proper antidote would have
cost the child's life.
Late last nicht Baby Eagan was resting
easily, with good chances for recovery.

Alcazar.
"Aunt Jack," a farce comedy which has
found much "favor In all parts of the
United States, was given at the Alcazar
Theater last evening by the regular stock
company. It is a three-act production,
full of all kinds |of laughable entangle
ments, which keeps the audience in good
humor throughout the evening. Miss
Mary Hampton as Aunt Jack won the
hearts of the people with her ability to
keep the fun going. Unfortunately she
has. a severe cold. Ernest Hastings and
Jeffrey Williams as barristers added to
the: general amusement. Frank Deni
thorne as an English dude received his
share of the applause. Miss Laura Crews"
appearance showed that she is one of the
Alcazar favorites. The others In the cast
filled their parts well. The great histori
cal, play, "Quo Vadis." is in preparation
for next week, and the management ex
pects it to be one of the "real successes of
the theater.
California.
"Pudd'nhead "Wilson," presented by the
late Edwin Mayo's sterling company, with
Burr, Melntosh In the title role, will be
presented again at the California Theater
to-night and for the "rest of the week.
The production is one of the best seen In
San Francisco ' for many a day and : the
audiences have been large In consequence.
There. la. not a bad actor In the company,
which Is saying much for a traveling

' Manila Bound," which displaced "The
Idol's Eye"- at the Tlvoll last night,
packed the house from stage to door, and
If applause counts for anything, made a
decided hit. The- chief character in
"Manila Bound" Is Anthony- Busch. a
wealthy retired Chicago brewer, and Fer
ris Hartman in that character easily held
the center of the, stage. -Tom. Green as
Caotaln Moreland, U. S. N., was In ex
cellent voice. and-Mlss Myers, Miss-Mer
rill and Miss Graham maintained their
reputations as clever vocalists and
actresses.
The choruses were exceptionally well
trained and contributed largely to the
success of the performance, the Highland
ballet and the sailer's hornpipe features
being splendidly executed. Branson and
AVheelan were as usual funny and enter
taining. The only criticism to be mada
Is that the performance drags slightly
and the waits are seeminsrly Intermin
able, but these faults will probably dis
appear after a few performances. .
Grand Opera-House.
"El Capltan" was revived at the Grand.
Opera-house last night and Sousa's mas
terpiece went with a swing and vim that
fairly electrified the audience. All the
popular numbers were encored and "El

success as it was at Its Initial perform
ance.
Olymipia.
The Olympla management â¢ has ' a good
bill this week. Alice Raymond has few

Identity. Her voice is one of the best
barytones heard here in some time.

HUNTINGTON
NAILS LAST
YELLOW LIE
Denies That the Company
Has Abandoned the Re
lief Bureau Scheme.
INTERVIEW ; UPON ARRIVAL
Â¦ . â¢ ... Â» â â _ Â¦
Railroad Magnate Will .Remain in
This City Until the Middle of
Mayâ Freight Rates
Are. Discussed.
Colllis P. Huntington, accompanied by.
his wife, H.E. Huntington and Julius
Kruttschnitt; arrived in this city about 8
o'clock last night and . proceeded imme
diately to hi 3 home on California street.
It is now ten. months since the president
of the Southern .Pacific has seen ' San
Francisco,- yet he is the same in appear
ance as to health, dtsplte his 80 years.
"f "The relief bureau seems to be giving
the morning: papers . "ofi San. Francisco a
great deal of worry." he said last night.
"According to the Examiner, why, we
have abandoned the scheme. -If so, that
Is the first I have heard of it. and I think
that I would have been Informed of It,
don't "you?" Then the "patriarch of the
Pacific iron ; network smiled and said
something uncomplimentary about yellow
Journalism and consistent unveracity.
The . story referred to by Huntlngton
was published on the front, pajre of the
Examiner Friday morning, March 16.
With>self-laudation and fulsome, blatant
horn-blowing the Examiner in that issue
claimed to have won a victory- for the
employes of the Southern Pacific in the
flÃht against the relief bureau. Hunting
ton's new insurance scheme. All through
the article Is the recurrent "We did it.'
But at this time Huntingdon was far
away. The story of the abandonment of
the relief bureau was denied by Julius
Kruttschnitt, who as general manager
controlled the new adjunct to the com
pany's business. And now comes Collis P.
Huntington himself, stamping the seal of
falsehood upon a self-erected and - as
sumed victory which the. Examiner boast
fully claims to have secured for the em
ployes of the railroad company. , .
Only a chosen few, that little recep
tion party which crosses the bay In an
nual pilgrimage to extend the hand of
welcome to the chief, were at the Oak
land mole when- Huntington's special
rolled in. R. P. Schwerin. E. O. Mc-
Cormick and Assistant . Manager Foster
waited with much patience for the arrival
of the president. With Huntington were
his nephew, H. E. Huntington, and Krutt
schnitt and Engineer Hood. Sproule, Her
rin, Stubbs and company are now In LOl
Angeles, busy with the affairs of the In
terstate Commerce Commission. Their
pardonable absence was felt and forgot
ten.
"Really. I can't see why there should
be any organized or unorganized opposi
tion to the relief bureau. We thought tho
matter over very carefully and It was to
benefit the employes of the company that
the scheme .was proposed. I did not wish
to. force any one- to join If they are op
posed to It. It is all for the benefit of
the employe and I think he will realize
it very soon." .
That is all C. P. Huntington had to add
to, his denial that the scheme of insurance
had been abandoned. He looks forward
to a speedy acceptance of the relief-bu
reau and a general resultant harmony.
Jn regard to freight rates the chief be
wailed the present condition of things and
declared that if the lower: rates were de
sired with such fierce longing why, he
would be content to allow them to remain
as they were, although they were at such
a a figure as to preclude any profit there
from. This may foreshadow a retraction
on the part of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and a reduction of freight rates re
cently â¢ elevated, contrary to the law of
the State and In the face of the prohibi
tive . action of the State Railroad Com
mission. According to the great mogul
of the company there will be no sweeping
changes made this spring. He expressed
himself as beinp -most- heartily satisfied
with the workings of things, loving all
his employes -with a deep.tender affec
tion. The road he Just rolled over he pro
nounces the finest in .the world." To-day
Collis P.. Huntington will Inspect the
yellow building, which has undergone a
cleaning and .polishing during 'the last
few days in anticipation of his visit.
Huntington will: remain in this city un
til the middle of May, when he will return
to New -York.

JUSTICE TO BOTH
PARTIES HIS AIM
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
Decides an Interesting Point
. in the Reavis Case.
; United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday, rendered an .opinion in the case
of .Thomas. M. -Reavis and others against
David M.' Reavis and others,' denying the
motion for a â¢ decree. "Tb.6 complainants
had moved for a decree pro confesso on
the ground that .a i motion to dismiss
(treated as a i plea in abatement), filed
after answer, waived answer. ' â¢
This is an action in equity â¢ brought on
January 20, 1596, by the complainants, res
idents of Missouri, as heirs at law of An
drew Reavis, . deceased, the - respondents
befng citizens and residents of California.
The bill charges that- the respondents
have . acquired : through . ' fraud certain
property, and, .rents and : profits formerly,
belonging to the Â¦ deceased.*" A: plea" of
abatement was filed on March. 4, 1896; by
the respondent Clark, alleging: that the
interest of David M.; Reavis, a. citizen of
California and a corespondent in the suit,
was '. united with . and â¢ not separate from
or adverse to or against the interests of
the complainants; and that the court had
no jurisdiction by reason of a lack of di
verse citizenship of the -litigants. Upon
this Issue a motion was made- by. Clarke
to dismiss the amended bill. This motion
was denied. Thereupon the complainants
moved for a default and I for a r Judgment
and for a decree pro confesso against the
respondent Clarke. ; In . the ! course â¢of his
opinion Judge Morrow^ said: .
I'< The motion , of : respondent Â» Clarke to dismiss
the bill is thus regarded as a plea In abatement
by complainant' h counsel. ( But it will be ob
served that this, motion : was i based upon the
special defense of a lack of jurisdiction raised
by the answer. To turn . this â¢ issue :of . the
answer - into a plea In abatement - and dispose
of the case upon the rules governing a:Judg

far have been unable to get the faintest
clew which would lead to the rounding up
of the dangerous characters. Regarding
the French Bank case of last week, under
exactly similar conditions, the same de
tectives have learned nothing of any im
portance, and the chances of apprehend
ing the men are slim. In the language of
the press censor, the robbers have the sit
uation well In hand.
California and Montgomery streets Is soon
to be torn -down,- and two of the stores,
one next to Sutro's and another at 442
California street, have already been va
cated. It is through the latter place that
the robbers gained entrance to where they
did the work. A simple springlock on a
hard-closing door was probably unlatched
by them on Saturday without attracting
notice. Once In this store it was a simple
matter to- reach. the yard of the Montgom
ery street place, and a <couple of newly
bored holes in the rear door, tell the story
of how the. old-fashioned lock -was killed
to complete their entrance.
Once inside the men were f ree to work
without fear of observation -from passers

THE reappearance of Paderewski
may be considered in one sense the
climax of our musical season, for
no other musical eventâ and there
" have been many of late â can claim
tho same importance if we are to consider
the question of true greatness.. ; Pade-'
rewskl, the pianist, is a figure in the per
spective of nineteenth century music that
stands out with no uncertain prominence,
and he is to be regarded not as one among
many but as an artist whose genius and
accomplishments have made a page in
history that, will endure -as long as the
art they, stapd .for is cultivated.
His pre-eminence is in part a result of
the enthusiasm that his unique personal
ity has . created and which has been nur
tured by device on. strictly business prin
ciples, but there Is abundant ability in the
man himself, and his mastery â¢ is, aside
from all extraneous considerations, a mat
ter of fact. '
The audience at the California last
night seemed to be about equally divided
between those whose Interest in music
is honest and sincere and those to whom
the' "occasion" was of the chief est im
portance/ It Is a noteworthy fact, how
ever, that the playing of Paderewski had
a compelling value and brought from all
his auditors the most genuine applause. I
hesitate to say that the approval was at
all times spontaneous, â¢ for I have never
known him to arouse his listeners with
his first number and keep them enthralled
throughout the programme, but apprecia
tion is so largely a question of mood that
there is no accounting for thÂ« effect that
even the most brilliant performance will
have upon" the individuals of an audience.
Saver enraptured me from the first item
to the last of several programmes, for in
mine own opinion his spirituality and
spell surpass that of any other artist;
but I have never warmed to the playing
of Paderewski until : at least a third of
the concert has been ' sounded Into mem
ory. Â¦ Â¦' " . Â¦ Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢
It was so last night. The first number,
"Etudes Symphonlques," by Schurmann,
was the only thing of any severity on the
programme, ' and Â¦= although they form a
contribution to pianoforte literature of
unquestioned importance, they^ do not
charm as much as they, excite admiration.
Paderewski played the Etudes | with bril
liant skill and used the pedals : with the
admirable effect he always compasses In
this Important feature of piano playing.
Beethoven's "Sonata Appaslonata" - was
the first item of the decidedly popular
programme that followed.- There was evi
dent in the first. movement the exquisite
sinKintr tone that one always associates
with Paderewski's playinsr and in the sec
ond movement* he -negotiated the fluent
variations with consummate art and fin
ish '.'Hark! Hark! the Lark!" -arid the
"Erl' King" were well given, the latter
with a.technique .that was admirable, if
not absolutely perfect. . . _ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
The Third Ballade was the first of a
group of familiar Chopin numbers and
displayed some Interesting fingering and
a notable velocity. The Nocturne.- op. 47,
wbs interpreted with that poetic quality
of expression that Paderewski brings to
compositions of the kind and came nearer
to being 'truly spirltuelle than anything
I have ever heard from him except a
