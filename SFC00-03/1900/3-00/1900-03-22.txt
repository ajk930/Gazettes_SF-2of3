"March ZLâ There are good reasons for. .believing that Great -Britain will ac
cept the Davis amendment to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, under which .tha
United States will have. the right to place the saras safeguard around tha NI- ;
caragua canal as. the' British Government enjoys In respect to the Sues*
canal. I It was strongly intimated to me to-day by a diplomat usually well In
formed'that Great Britain. . with . some - show Â¦of reluctance at first, will in Â¦
the end sdopt the amendment. My Informant also expresses- the opinion
that all the European nations .will join In the neutrality agreement contem
plated* by the treaty, notwithstanding the Davis amendment. - -, ,
Senator Davis will urge consideration of the treaty at an early date, as it
is his belief that Great Britain will agree to the amendment. There seems to
be no doubt of the ratification of the treaty in its amended form.
:- The object of the Davis amendment: to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty Is la
effect to place in; the, hands of the United States the same authority for con
trol of the Nicaragua canal as Great Britain enjoys In respect to the Suez
canalâ that Is, the United States. shall have the right to take what measures
it may; find necessary: for securing by. Its own forces the defense of the
. United States and ; the maintenance of public order.
.Â¦ . The \ Central > American < .' republics " heartily applauded thÂ© Hay-Paunce
fote. treaty ."because It, seemed to assure prompt building of the canal by tha
United States, with 'its; neutrality assured. Representatives of both Nicara
gua and Costa Rica, however,* expressed regret . when the Davis -amendment
was offered." They said -that -'their Governments would certainly opposa a
' modification which would make it possible for the United States to take pos
session of their territory, whenever .'it deemed such action necessary.
Since the, war with Spain,' and the acquisition of Porto Rico and tha Phil
ippines by the United States, the Central American republics have developed
- a fear that - this Government . may Â¦ acquire a desire for further expansion and
that they may suffer as a result. Â¦ t>" Â¦

' IV I Passengers who arrived to-day on

Canal Commission, lieutenant R. >12

in this city. for. a day or two. and then
Join .'General Haines In Washington. Com
missioner Noble â¢ said that they did not
bring with them any portion of the re
port, but that they might be called upon
to. go before the Congressional commit
tees. Seven of the Commissioners, he
said.were now In Costa Rica, one of the
objects of. their visit being to call upon
the* President of that State i and find out
what concessions : could be obtained.
Commissioner George C. Morrison of New
York, he sate, was on his way to the
Darlen -country with a surveying party
looking-for a 'possible route in that re
gion. Commissioner Noble declined to In
dicate the Impression he or the other
Commissioners - received- as ,to the Â¦<Â¦ best
route for a" canal or "to- forecast what the
rec6mraendktlonÂ«'^rm;be. The only thing
he' would say was: '"* Â¦Â¦'' â' "
" I A think "the ".American "people willjwant a,
route. across the Isthmus, but the work of die--
Kin* . the canaP on any , route will take longer
: than' anybody seems to think." Â»
Feasible : Boute Selected.
- Before his departure for Baltimore Gen
eral Halnes said: ;
The present commissioners report will not
only decide upon a practical route for an Isth
mian canal, but will demonstrate conclusively
that the mute selected is the most feasible one
that could have been chosen. W e have at pres
ent about 300 surveyors in the field under the
charge of competent engineers. They are go
ing with the greatest care over the Nicaragua
route Â» the Panama route and all the other
routes ' suggested by any of the former Â¦ sur-
Ve Beglde9 this we have a number of exploring
parties out. . in the hope of discovering sites
that have been hitherto, overlooked. . Our object
Is to do the work with such thoroughness that
our results cannot Dossibly be questioned at
any future time.. We have the reports of all
previous surveys, but we. shall cover every
mile of ground through which we think it pos
sible for the canal to be run. The country is
varied and the work of the surveyors is diffi
cult and progress slow, especially In the section
about Darlen.
For this reason tt Is impossible to set even
an. approximate date for presenting oar formal
report to the State Department Unless Con
gress especially requires one, we shall submit
no preliminary report. Until our work la done,
therefore, it is Improper for any member of the
commission to â¢ speak in regard to the merit ot
the several routes' proposed.
Commissioner Noble was asked If tha
commission had found the representations
of the Panama canal people who wero at
Washington before thÂ» commission lelt,
to be .true. He replied:
I think they have the number of men em
ployed that they eald they had. It Is a fact,
too. that they have done the dredging and arÂ«
cutting down the hill. Things are much as they
said they were. |
The present Panama Canal Company hat
been spending the money It has mainly la mak
ing a narrow, deep cut through the great dlvldÂ«
that it has to get through to reach the other
coast. -The work. ls betns well done. la re
gard to the Chagres River, we have found that
the Panama people have a feasible way w
manage that, although everybody laughed at
them when they said they could do It. We hayÂ«
a surveying party at this point now making thÂ«
necessary survey on their plans.
Ex-Secretary Evarts' Views.
"WASHINGTON. March 21.â 1n response
to. a resolution of the Senate the Presi
dent to-day sent to that body the cor
respondence between the United States
and Â¦; the I Government' of Colombia, rela
tive, .to the Panama canal. Â¦ The corre
spondence covers the period from 1373 tÂ«
1397. and much of It has been heretofore

ISBO. from Secretary Evarts to. United
States Minister Emart - Dychman, con
cerning the Panama canal concessions. In
which the Secretary says:
The Governnwat of the United State* might
be willing in the matter of the mere mercan
tile Interests of its citizens to trust to the In
telligent self-interest of those who undertake
Its construction, to see that reasonableness and
equality of tolls, simplicity of regulation and
perfect â¢ Impartiality of treatment . should ibÂ«
made the inducements to draw the commerce
of all nations to its channel. Bat It cannot be
concealed, and the Government of the United
States does' not attempt to conceal, that Its
relation to this enterprise must be governed by
larger and more serious considerations. ' This
enterprise, once achieved, works more than a
commercial Â¦ revolution. It touches the. condi
tions under which the security of the United
States may need to be maintained. While thÂ«
United States feels . no concern as to the ade
quacy of Its power to meet any exnersendei
that may arise, while there Is no Issue In tha
world's politics which at all threatens lti
tranquillity. . while its relations with all na
tions are of peace and' rood .will, yet it Is not
unwise- to antlcioata possible contingencies

LONDON, March 22.â Possibly
the most important war news
of the day is contained in this '
dispatch from Cape Town to the Daily.
Mail: " â¢ . '
"I have just arrived here from
Bloemfontein. I was informed that
no further movement was probable
for three weeks, as some negotiations
were proceeding. I was unable to
learn the nature of these negotiations
or whether Sir Alfred Milner's de
parture from Cape Town had any
connection with them. - . â¢ -- <~,
"There is, however, every sign
that the Free Staters are anxious to
give up, and it would not be surpris
ing if the* war collapsed quickly,-for
though there are no definite indica
tions of the feelings of the Trans
vaalers many stories are afloat to the
effect that they are anxious to cease
fighting."
LONDON. March 22.â The opinion is
held by some here that Milne r's mission
relates to the forming of a temporary ad
ministration for the Free State. The:
whole of the southern Boer republic, ac
cording to the dispatches, Is believed to
be willing to submit. It is not thought
probable here that the negotiations re
ferred to concern the Transvaal Govern
ment.
From Bloemfontein come reports of
Free Staters surrendering and returning
to their farms, and of British forces ac
cumulating stores and making prepara
tions for the nexts tep in" the campaign.
North of Lord Roberts' headquarters the
Boers are busy in the destruction of
bridges and culverts on the railroad.
Three bridges have been blown upâ one
over the Modder River, fourteen mfles
north of Bloemfonteln. another at the Vet
River, between Brandfort station and
Ventersberg. and a third over the Valsch,
Immediately in front of Kroonstad. The
Transvaal Boers are reported to be de
termined strongly to oppose the British
advance at the latter point.
On the western border of the Free State
Lord Methuen found the Boers In a forti
fied position at Warrenton. Colonel Pake
man had several days' fighting at Four
teen Streams. The burghers are said to
have retired twenty miles northeasterly to
Christiana.
It is reported that the British occupied
Christiana, which, if true, would consti
tute the first invasion of the South Afri
can republic's territory. It appears more
and more likely that these engagements
are torerur.ners of an advance of a third
army of it least 20,000 men on Pretoria" by
way of Kircberley. where the Teomantry,
Colonials and fresh troops from England
are concentrating as a base.
At ANwal North General Brabant is still
opposed by an apparently determined
body tf Boerc. but General French Is be
hind them and the British columns are
creeplrg around them by w ; ay of Roux
vllle and Smithficld. General Clements
and General Gatacre are well advanced
on thrir march to Bloemfonteln and are
receivinf. according to the dispatches to
the Lonfion papers, the surrender of num
erous bodies of Free Staters.
The establishment of a train service be
tween Cape Town and Bloemfontein
chows conclusively that Lord Roberts has
male himself the, actual master of the
Free State territory weet and south of
Bloemfontein. He is In effective military
occupation of more than half of the total
curhstahces, nothing but. to '.express Its

which may expose our systems to trial not now
obvious or i>robable.
He then dwells upon the changed con
ditions which would be made apparent in
case of war and pays:
All the treaties of neutrality In the world
mlrht fail to be a safeguard In a time of great
conflict.
He. therefore. Instructs Dychman to say
to the Colombian Government "that It is
a source of profound regret to this Gov
ernment that the Government of Colom
bia hitherto refrained from communiear
tion upon the subject of the recent com
mission, as the treaty relations between
the two countries Justified us In expect-
Attitude of This Nation.
He added that the United States would
demand that the construction of an Isth
mian canal "should be the subject of Joint
consideration, with a view to the protection
of those interests which bind the South
and North American republics together
as closely as other interests and relations
bind the European powers." He also gave
Instructions to add that the United States
Government did not consider itself ex
cluded by an agreement to which it was
not a party. On this point he said:
You will add that this Government cannot
consider itself excluded by any arrangement
between any other powers or individuals Â¦ to
which it Is not a party, from a direct interest,
and, if neceshary. a positive supervision and
interposition in the exploitation of any project
which by completing an lnteroceanlc con
nection throuarh the isthmus would materially
affect its commercial interests, change the
territorial relations of its own so\-erelgnty and
Impose on it the necessity of a foreign policy,
which, whether in its feature of warlike prepa
ration, or entangling alliance, has been hither
to arduously avoided. .Â»â¢Â¦'.Â¦
Concluding a long communication, he
Â¦aid:
Should this lntM-oc^anie connection ever be
Achieved and should ita control become in the
complications of International relatloc* a mat
ter of Importance to any power it will surely
not be deemed by the Colombian Government
either dlFreFpectful or unfriendly- to -Miriest
that the military rtrenjrth of the Government of
Colombia would he Inadequate to maintain - Its
feetirlty or neutrality and the enforcement of
the guarantee of the L'nlted States would prob
ably be sought, as It' has been heretofore.
Should the possibility of such a necessity be
come a Drobable ocenrrence It would be the
ixiiy of the L'nited States, not only to them
ivlves, but to the Government of Colombia, to
wÂ» that they were In a position to enforce the
fruaranteee which existing treaties Impose upon
them and which their feeling of sincere friend
ship for the Government of Colombia would In
duce them to fulfill with scrupulous fidelity.
Ex-Secretary Foster's Protest.
Another communication of some interest
is that of ex-Secretary Foster to Mr.
Ccrughlln of December 22, 1592, relating to
the request of the Panama Canal Com
pany for an extension of one year. He
opposed the concession, saying that the
company was bankrupt and hence the ap
plication for an extension was not bona
fide.
"In view of this." he said, "the United
States Government earnestly trusts that
no such extension will be granted without
substantial guarantee*." r
Reporting later that the extension had
been granted Minister Abbott said:
"The time will never come, in my judg
ment, when the Colombian Government
will refuse to grant canal concessions to
European companies until a definite prop
osition for the construction of the work
shall come from the government or a re
liable company of the United States."
The last document of the series Is a
remonstrance from Charge d'Affaires
Rengifo of the Colombian Legation at
Washington against the attitude of the
United States Government toward the
Nicaraguan canal. He said the new
Panama Canal Company was well
equipped and reminded the Secretary of
State that there were doubts about the
practicability of^ the construction of the
Nicaragua route. - He expressed doubt as
to whether, with the two canals con
structed either would pay and reminded
tha United States that the support given
by this country to the Nicaragua route
would be injurious to Panama. Hon.
John Sherman was then Secretary of
State and the record shows that he only
!ormally acknowledged the note.

Sj*clal Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, March 21.â William F.
, Michener and Mrs. Mary V. Miller, both
;of this city, to-day married themselves
. without the aid of any preacher and wlth
,out even having previously secured a cer
'tiftcate. Their, marriage must be recog-r
nized -by the' law, too* It was the first
marriage of -the kind : which * was ever
solemnized in the State of California, ac
cording to the claim made by the parties.
It;was made under the law of the Quaker
:church, originated by George Fox, the
founder of the Quaker church in Kngland
250 years ago. " -
â¢ Several other States of the Union, after
a strong effort had been made, recognized
this form of ceremony and in 1887, through
the efforts of Senator C. M. Simpson,
California legalized it. The groom .did
not have to procurea license. On Satur
day, February 17, the bride and groom in
formed the Quaker church that they con
templated marriage. A committee was
appointed to see that there were no ob
stacles. Thirty days later the committee
reported that there were none. ' . The
couple then informed the church that they
were still In the same mind and another
committee was appointed by the congre
gation to see. that' the Â¦ ceremony- was
properly performed. ,
This morning at 10:30 o'clock .was the
time set. At the. close, of the prayer
service bride and groom stepped before
the congregation, facing â¢ the groom's
brother. Dr. J. C. Michener, a prominent
physician, was the first waiter or grooms
man, and Professor and Mrs. I. N. Vali;
the nearest relatives of- the bride, were
her attendants. The couple Joined their
right hands and the groom said: Â¦Â¦' .r-"Friends,. r 
"Friends, in the presence of the Lord
and before this assembly I take Mary V.
Miller to be my wife, promising -with di
vine assistance to be unto her a loving
and faithful husband until death shall
separate us."
The bride repeated S this formula and
they inscribed their names upon a certifi
cate reading:
"William F. Michener and Mary V. Mil
ler of the 'county of Los Angeles. State
of California, having made known their
intentions of marriage with each other In
a public meeting of Friends held in Pasa
dena this 21st day of March, in the year
of our Lord 1900, declared that in the
presence of our Lord they took each other
for husband and i wife. And as a further
confirmation thereof they did then and
there In this presence subscribe their
names, she, according to the custom of
marriage, accepting tne name of .her hus

The witnesses signed the certificate.
There was no ring and no music.
MYSTERY OF
CLAYSON-OLSEN
PARTY SOLVED
Their Dead Bodies Frozen
in the Ice Near
# ' Minto.
? . â
Further Evidence Against O'Brien,,
the Suspect, Who Is Now Serv
ing a Term for Stealing Â¦
i . Scows.
Â¦ VICTORIA, B. C, March 21.â The mys
tery surrounding the Clayson-Olsen party
promises to be cleared up, the bodies of
the missing men having been found in the
river three miles on the Skaguay side of
Minto. The rlews was brought by the
steamer Amur, which reached here this
morning from Skaguay.
Several days before the Amur left the
Alaskan port Pinkerton Detective Mc-
Guire and Captain Scarth of the mounted
police sent messengers to Fort Selkirk in
hot haste to get ice saws, stating that
they had located a hole In the Ice through
which three men had been pushed and
that they were sure they had at least one
of the murderers in :jall at Selkirk. The
reference is of course to, O'Brien, who is
now serving a term for stealing scows.
The point where 'the 'bodies were located
is not close to the trail, showing that the
theory that they had been traveling on
bicycles behind one another, and through
an accident were precipitated Â¦ into tho
river, is untenable.' 'On the lower
stratum the Ice is discolored with human
blood.'
' The Alaskan says:
"There is other evidence. Near the spot
of the burial was found a broken
"brother*/ sleevelink and a pocketknlfe,
both of -which are particularly identified
as belonging . to young Relfe. Further
than this, a closer examination of the
cabin". near Minto, occupied at the time
of the .tragedy by O'Brien, has led to
other i discoveries. He had evidently
burned up a lot of wearing apparel, and
in* the embers have been found, buttons
that will probably be Identified.".
The Coroner's jury in the cases of Burt
Horton and his wife have returned a ver
dict of murder by Indians.

FRESH STAMPEDE
TO STEWART RIVER
Special Dispatch- to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 21.â Arrivals
by the steamer Amur, which reached here
this morning with the startling news of
the finding of the bodies of the murdered
Clayson-Relfe-Olsen party, tell of astam
nede to Stewart River. That gold bear-
Ing stream, which has more fluctuations
than the majority of northern rivers. Is
now the Mecca of a great crowd of min
ers, who are rushing from near and far.
The people of Stewart have gone In a
body to a new find up the river. The dis
coverer lsÂ» W. Suttle, who was. grub
staked by some Dawson parties and who.
in a spirit of pique at alleged mean treat
ment by them when he was ill, has made
the news of his find public: 1 He Is now
hurrying In, guiding Humboldt Gate* and
a large paTty of Dawsonians to the find.
Suttle says his discovery is on a tribu
tary of the Stewart and he claims to have
taken out J5OO In a few hours.
R. R. Rae and F. H. Nagle, with nine
Malamoot dogs and a basket sled, have
reached Skagway from Cape Nome. They
made good time, reaching Dawson from
the Arctic In thirty-four days' running
time and fifty-two days actual time, leav

rttn Â»AiN JuA^CISCb ;cXLL, THURSDAY^ MARCH 22, 190 U.
The Eminent Kidney Specialist, Discoverer of Swamp-Boot, in His Laboratory.
Just as sure as the break of dawn
Â¦neans another day, so does pain In the
back indicate kidney trouble.
When your kidneys become weak and
are unable to throw off the waste In the
blood they clog up with poisonous mat-
ter, break down, cell by cell, and the
particles pass away in the urine. Then
the albumen, which makes rich, red
blood, leaks out, your system breaks
down and you have what is known to
ail mankind as Bright's Disease.
Bright's Disease is taking away more
lives to-day than any other known ail-
ment, except possibly consumption;
and yet with a little attention you may
prevent such a calamity at Bright's
Disease befalling you.
Are you fortified with the necessary
knowledge about Bright's Disease? Do
you know how to find out if there is
anything the matter with your kid-
neys? Here is a simple but sure test:
In the morning, on arising, take of
your urine about four ounces and put
it In a glass bottle; let It stand about
twenty-four hours, and if, on examina-
tion, you find any settling or sediment.
If it Is cloudy or if small particles float
in it, then you may be assured that
nature has warned you, and that your
kidneys need attention.
The mild and immediate effect of the
famous new discovery, Swamp-Root, Is
soon realized. It stands the highest for
its wonderful cures of the most dis-
tressing cases.
Swamp-Root is the discovery of the
eminent kidney specialist, and is not
recommended for all diseases, but if
you have kidney, bladder or uric acid
troubles, or diseases depending upon
these disorders, you will find SvC'amp-
Root Just the remedy you need.
Swamp-Root is used in the leading
hospitals, and is taken by doctors them-
selves who have kidney ailments, be-
cause they recognize in it the greatest
and most successful remedy for kid-
ney and bladder troubles.
Swamp-Root will set your whole sys-
tem right, and In order that all afflicted
may know its benefits, a special ar-
rangement has been made with the
San Francisco Daily Call by -which all
readers of our. paper who will send their
names and addresses to ,Dr. Kilmer &
Co., BinÃhamton, N. V.. will be sent
absolutely free, by mail, a sample bot-
tle of Swamp-Root. Also a book of
vaJue treating of. all kinds of kidney
diseases and containing some of the
thousands of testimonial letters re-
ceived from sufferers cured.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root Is what you need you can
purchase the regular 50-cent and $1 size
bottles at the drup stores.

claimed that natives of Nicaragua in the
confidence of President Zelaya are buying

part of the country in lots of from 30<W
to 4000 acres each. These operations, It
is pointed out. have become active since
the recent conferences between the Isth

dent and it is declared they indicate a
willingness on the part of the Government
to sell to the United States at an accept
able price a belt of land across Nicaragua
from ocean to ocean, having the canal
route as its long axis. Heretofore, it is
further said, the friends of the President
have been careless in regard to securing
lands at low rates in view of the con

ception of havingsecured several hundred
thousand acres extending north from the

PROBING MICHIGAN
MILITIA SCANDAL
Trial of ex-Inspector General Arthur
F. Marsh Begins at
Lansing. % . ' - ;
LANSING, Mich., March. 2l.â The first
testimony was taken ' to-day in the trial
of Arthur F. Marsh, ' ex-Inspector : . Gen
eral, for alleged complicity: In the State
military clothing . frauds. Two deputy
Attorneys General swore to-communica
tions between the Indicted ex-offlcers and
the Attorney General's office In reference
to the disposal of the clothing in; ques
tion.- The witnesses testified that the in
dicted military officers did not follow the
Attorney General's advice, which was to
turn over such clothing as the military
board desired to dispose of to the Board
of State Auditors. Records of the mili
tary board's proceedings were introduced
as evidence.
Governor Pingree was sworn as a wit
ness this afternoon and a letter which
had not heretofore figured in the case was
produced in evidence. It was signed by
the Governor* and addressed to Quarter
master General White, directing White to
enter into two contracts for equipping the
National Guard and to advertise for bids.
Governor Pingree said the letter was
genuine. He could not remember the cir
cumstances, nor could- he remember any
thing about it, nor recall .that any one
ever asked him to sign the letter. He
eald, however, that he would sign such
a letter s to-day if the Quartermaster Gen
eral asked him to do so. He did not know
that such a quantity of clothing was on
hand, nor that the board . contemplated
purchasing $60,000 worth of goods. Â¦'Â¦Â¦
The prosecutor produced a letter read
before the Detroit corporation counsel,
which- 'is the office in which ' Colonel Sut
ton, one of the indicted men, is employed,
and had the Governor compare it with the
paper on which the order was written.
The paper appeared similar, the printed
letter-head having been torn from the or
der. - . -
The Governor stated that he ' never
dreamed that any . improper use was to
be made of the money received from the
tale of State clothing and Judge Cahill
stated on behalf of the prosecution that
no one ever entertained the slightest idea
that the Governor had any knowledge of
the affair.

RESIGNATION OF
WHEELER HELD
IN ABEYANCE
President in No Hurry to
i Let "Fighting Joe"
Withdraw.
"WASHINGTON, March , ' 21.â General
Wheeler called at the War Department
this morning and officially reported, his
return/ from the Philippines to Secretary
Root, <in ; accordance with the orders of
the department. It was expected that The
question of General TVheeler's ' future
military status would be determined at
this meeting. Secretary Root was bu
busy, Â¦ however, with other Important
questions that it was concluded best to
defer the consideration of General Wheel
er's case to a more opportune time. The
matter probably will be 'settled within a
few days. Meanwhile the resignation of
General Wheeler from the volunteer army
will be held in abeyance t and the ques
tion as to his eligibility 'to a. seat In Con
gress will beneld up pending the settle
ment of his military status. Â¦--Â¦Â¦-- Â¦.:Â¦ -
. There Â¦is a strong desire '-to' put the
names of General Wheeler and General
Lee on the retired list of the army with
the rank of ; brigadier general, ;but v the
carrying out of this plan requires special
legislation. ; The ; existing law 'prohibits a
man, 64 years of age from serving on, the
active list in the army. General Lee Is
over 64 1 and General Wheeler wlll.be 64, 1n
September. Only the , latter,\ therefore, is
eligible to appointment In the regular
army. - ' The short time he would have to
serve In case of appointment' ls made an
argument against such action. . Moreover,
the â¢ desire of the President is to honor
both of the distinguished volunteer offi
cers in the same way. : .With | the conesnt
of Congress Â¦ Jt ; would be possible to '. ap
point them : brigadier generals on " the re
tired list. \ Such action would enable them
to relinquish their present duties and In
sure their future welfare.
: - Following the precedent established in
the case of ? General Shatter, General
Wheeler may, continue on active duty in
definitely under his commission;*
but in case of his transfer to the regular
army Â¦he would >be l obliged to relinquish
active duty Â¦ upon ; reaching the age . of 64
years. Â¦ There is reason ! to ' believe i> that
General Wheeler would be willing, to fore
go his rights to a seat in Congress under
existing conditions, providing, he" were;as
sured of an appointment â¢to the Â¦ regular
army.* As " an officer on â¢ the ; retired iist
there would be no question as to his eligi
bility to a seat in the national legislature
in case his former constituents desired: to
elect him.
Alpha May Not Sail.
Special Dispatch to The Call
VANCOUVER, 8.-C, March 21.â Ftom
a telegram received by United States Con
sur Dudley this afternoon from the Secre
tary of the Treasury at Washington It ap
pears impossible that the Canadian
steamer Alpha will be able to Ball for
Cape Nome at all. Two days ago the
Consul asked the department at Washing
ton if the Alpha would be allowed to
carry a Customs Inspector from Seattle
or Dutch Harbor to Cape Nome to act
there as a temporary Collector of Cus
toms and take duties due on goods shipped
by the Alpha. The reply to-day cited sec
tion 2971 of the Revised Statutes, which
provides that no foreign steamer shall
"unlode" at other than a port of entry,
and added that (he steamer Alpha cannot
carry freight to Cape Nome **under any
conditions." Consul Dudley says that It
appear* to him now that the only way the
steamer can go to Cape Nome is by spe
cial permit, such as she received from thÂ»
department at Washington last year.

The Mayor of Portsmouth has received

and Cuban interests of the people of any
of the "dominant nations.
Situation Misunderstood.
.So little is the situation understood in
the United States that it . Is necessary to
explain the wide difference between Span
iards /and Cubans. The Spaniards "are
very largely the property-owning
and business class. They constitute 'the
conservative element 7 and the .worthy.
Things may go very badly and' they, raise
no clamor. The Cubans are professional
agitatorsâ ne'er-do-wells, men with taint
ed records, largely negroes, fellows who
won't work and want office. They are the
restless, irresponsible element of the. coun
try. And they seem to make the public
sentiment â at least that which customar
ily gets diffused In the United States. The
Cuban, having drawn the assistance of
the United States, by his shrill alarms in
the name of patriotism, and having stood
by and drawn his rations while our sol
diers drove from his island the people in
power, is now furious that Uncle Sam
does not turn the reins of power over to
him without limitation and himself get
out. To that end the Cuban pressâ and
the distinction is always to be made be
tween Cuban and Spanishâ is filled dally
with vituperation of Americans, and .the
Cuban . agitator finds . a Â¦ favorite . epigram
in the expression that, Cuba, In the pro
cess of getting rid of one tyrannical Gov
ernment, has taken on another. Enter
prise Is pretty well at'a standstill.. Even
planting is not being resumed to its old
time extent. There is more encourage
ment to capitalists- from other countries
to come in and invest In enterprises than
to : Americans to do so. "With the well
defined antipathy, of the classes that are
likely to get control In the event of com
plete American, withdrawal. American in
vestment would be much more likely to
suffer, and so It comes about that Ameri
cans are getting no foothold and the peo
ple of other countries are taking greater
chances in the business of ', the island
than those who have the greatest right.

WASHINGTON, March 21.â The exami
nation of S. A. F. Gill was continued be
fore the Coeur d'Alene Investigation Com
mittee to-day. In response to Inquiries by
Representative Lentz, the witness told of
a visit to the "bull pen." '.At that time a
prisoner chanced to put his fingers
through n hole in the. side of the prison.
Thereupon, the witness said, a colored
soldier, who was on guard on the outside,
shoved his bayonet at the protruding fin
gers, inflicting a bloody wound.
A copy of the permit required of those
seeking work In the Cover d'Alene dia
trict was introduced. It recited at length
the facts concerning ,the holder, that he
was not a member of a union, and that he
took an oath to obey the law. The wit
ness said he had not taken out a permit,
regarding it as a badge of servitude and
unAmerican to require an oath to Â¦ obey
the law. Representative Jett made ' the
point that the law; presumed that a citizen
obeyed. the law until otherwise proved.
â¢The cross-examination, was directed to
showing that the permit system was de
signed to .secure an orderly force of
workmen in the mines. The witness main
tained, however, that its effect was to
blacklist those who did not take out a
permit and also to make an "oligarchy or
aristocracy", of those in control of- the
permit system. - He said the class of min
ers had deteriorated under the system,
so that now women did ". not take the
night trains, as many drunken men carry
ing dirks in their, belts were on board.
i Representative ILenz 'produced a form
of warrant, which the witness identified
as the one in general use. It was in type
writing.'with blank spaces for the inser
tion of. names,* and directed that the per
sons named should be taken- and held for
violating the proclamation of the Gover
nor of Idaho, declaring martial law,- and
the rules and regulations of the military
district established thereunder.
Innocent Man Arrested.
Â¦â¢TV.- R. Shields, a commercial traveler,
testified to having been at St. Rogls.
Mont., 'some distance from the' Coeur
d'Alene trouble, when a miner named
Francis was placed under arrest by sol
diers. Shields said the townspeople stated
that Francis had worked there for many
months, including the time of the riot,
but he was. nevertheless, arrested ar.d
taken to the "bull pen."- The witness
testified to the harshness of the soldiers.
Lentz asked that Bartlett Sinclair tak-i
the stand. Sinclair Is the official appoint
ed by Governor Steunenberg to take
charge' of affairs in the Coeur d'Alene
district and his name has been most fre
quently used during the course of the in
vestigation. Chairman Hull said Sinclair
could not be called at this point as the
committee -had heretofore . determined to
hear all witnesses to support the chaiges
and there were several yet to be he.*rd.
An animated discussion followed. Sulzer
declared that the minority would not pro
ceed further if the committee insisted on
calling Young instead of ' Sinclair at thin
time. Capron of Rhode Island character
ized this as a threat.
By a vote of 9 .to 4 -the committee de
cided not to call Sinclair as a witness for
the prosecution.
Sulzer thereupon ' announced that the
prosecution would rest Its case. This
cleared the way for the opening of the
defense, but as". the hour was late the
committee adjourned , until to-morrow
morning, .when. It Is expected. Governor
Steunenberg will tbe called.
MORTALITY IN
PHILIPPINES
OVERRATED
Sensational Statements De
nied by the War De
partment.
Actual Average Death Bate Is Less
Than One Hundred a Month,
Not a Thousand as
Published.
WASHINGTON. March 21.â War De
partment, officials deny recently published
statements that General Otis' campaign
is costing upward of 10U0 men every
month. Recording to the official records
since the American occupation, June' 1,
ISMS, to February 17, 1900, the actual mor
tality in the army in the Philippines was
Co ofiicers and 1460 men, a total of 1525, or
at the rate of 74 deaths a month.
More details are contained in the report
of Colonel Woodbull, chief surgeon. His
report, however, does not extend beyond
the end of - the last calendar year. It
shows that up to December 1, IS9Â», the to
tal number of deaths were 58 ofticers and
12G3 men. Of this number 42 olttcers and
570 men died by violence and lb oincera
and tÂ»3 men died of disease. Most of the
deaths by violence occurred in battle.
There were, however, 137 deaths from vio
lence outside of actual hostilities. It is a
singular fact that more than one-half of
the latter class were caused by drowning.
The total number of wounded without
fatal results during the period covered by
the report was 1767.
Surgeon General Sternberg says that
many of the alarming statements of dis
ease and death in the Philippines seem to
be based on the fact that large details of
contract surgeons are being issued to the
Philippines. The fact of the matter is
there is no particular increase of the num
ber of medical ofticers in the Philippines.
The contract surgeons now being sent
there are simply to take the places of
others whose contracts Have expired and
who are entitled to come home. He ad
mitted that twenty-four officers of the
medical department were on the transport
which sailed from San Francisco a few
days ago. but explained that they had
been gathering at San Francisco for sev
eral weeks, awaiting transportation under
orders issued in the" usual routine. Â¦
WINSLOW'S ANSWER
TO BISHOP POTTER
BOSTON, March 21.â The statement
given out by Bishop Potter of New York
as to conditions in the Philippine Islands
as he found them has drawn forth a
letter from Irving Winslow, secretary of
the New England Anti-Imperialist
League, in which he says:'
The Anti-Imperialist League proposes to
stand loyally by the republic. As for the in
habitants of the Philippine Islands, we have
positive reasons for knowing that" the elements
that composed the admirable congress and
administration with which we should have
treated fourteen months ago still exist and can
easily be eathered together In sucn a manner
as to promise a reasonably rapid evolution to
ward native self-government, assisted by an
American alliance established by the neutraliza
tion of the islands. Permit, me to demur to
the conculslon to which you seemed to have
arrived In a very short space of time (four
days) and under circumstances not quite fa
vorable to fair Judgmentâ the environment of
an enemv*s camp. The majority of the civil
ized people of the Philippines, especially the
middle class, are neither friendly to the Amer
ican Government nor ready to come under It.
Notorious circumstances In the Island of Luzon
to-day contradict your Inference. We have rea
son to believe that our opinions are those of
the great mass of the common people of Amer
ica, thouch the "better" or commercial class
with us. as In th* Philippines, may be satis
fied with what is going on. Ignoranily hoping
It will bring them "Increased prosperity." In
short, our cause Is the cause of the plain peo
ple, whit* or brown, against avarice and am
bition hiding under the cloak of pseudo-philan
thropy. ,

SALOON-KEEPER SHOT
BY A HIGHWAYMAN
Robber Secured All His Victim's
Beady Cash and Hade. His Es
cape Into the Woods.
Special Diepatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 21.â At Buckley a self
possessed young highwayman shot and
killed a saloon-keeper he had just robbed,
rather than allow the latter to seize his
gun and turn" the tables on him, to-night.
At 9:30 o'clock Nels Moe, proprietor of the
Senate Saloon, was leaning over his bar
talking to Ole Foside. Foside finished his
glass of beer and started home by . the
back door. Just as he reached it a stern
voice from the rear commanded him to
halt and throw up his hands. Turning he
saw a robber leveling a gun at Moe. The
robber ordered Moe to give him all the
money in his till and pockets.
Moe hesitated, but another look Into the
muzzle decided him. The robber received
every cent. As the latter turned to es
cape Moe reached over the bar and en
deavored to seize a- gun. Quick as a wink
the robber pulled the trigger and fired. A
ball went crashing into Moe's brain, strik
ing him In the forehead over the left eye.
Frightened at his crime the robber turned
and fled. Foside then took down his up
raised hands and hastened to Moe's side,
at the same time giving the alarm. Moe
had staggered out from behind the * bar
and into the street. Feeling himself too
weak to go further he turned back and
fell dead on his threshold.- Large pools of
blood were found where he fell and behind
the bar.
The robber had crossed the railroad
tracks and got Into the forest beyond be
fore any start could be made to appre
hend him. All nearby towns were fur
nished with his description by telephone,
and it is believed he will be captured. An
hour after the shooting Â¦â¢ a large posse
started out to search for him, headed by
James McNelley. Justice of the ' Peace.
The robber was dressed, smooth
shaven and wore no mask.
' Moo was about 30 years old and unmar
ried. He had lived in Buckley for eight
years, being well liked by the loggers and
miners, who are anxious to avenge his
death. The highwayman secured about
$100.

wise the debate was without incident.
Both friends and opponents of the meas

be close. Loud has agreed to accept two
amendments, one to increase the Â¦ number
of sample copies which newspapers may
send out at second-class rates from 500 to

requiring the newspapers to *Â¦ separate

ELEVATOR FALLS
WITH THIRTY PERSONS
Occupants Injured by a Drop From
the Third Floor to the Basement
of a Chicago Building. _
CHICAGO, March 2Lâ Thirty persons
were Injured shortly after 6 o'clock this
morning by the falling of a freight ele
vator in the rear of the building at 128
Market street, where the victims of the
accident were employed by the Blakeley
Printing Company. It is thought none of
the injured will die, although several were
badly hurt. Following are the most se
riously injured: George Hale. Albert
Christian. Joseph Hoffman, Albert Selfert,
Ernest Hems, James Delaney, Walter
Hartwig, Patrick Foley, Edward Levl,
James Thomas, George Wenkes, John
Rambo. John Hall, Edward Tavill, Ed
ward Wolf, Edward King, Louis Stan ton
and George Cotnpton.
The men had worked all night in the
printing shop and had crowded into the
elevator at the top floor. The big ele
vator moved slowly down until the
third floor was reached. Then, according
to Harry Olson, who had taken hold of
the rope which set the machine going,
something snapped, and an Instant later
the lift, filled with its mass of agon
ized victims, crashed Into the basement.
"First aid to the injured" work was
toon given In a neighboring building, to
â¢which the victims were taken, but it was
some time before a sufficient number of
ambulances were procured to remove the
Injured to their homes, or, In the more
serious cases, to the hospital.
The accident was caused by the
breaking of the engine In the base
ment.
Free Coinage Amendment.
WASHINGTON, March 2Lâ Senator
Morgan to-day introduced' an amendment
to the Porto Rican bill providing for free
coinage of silver. It is limited to the

HAVANA, March 10.â Secretary of
War Root has paid a visit to Cuba
which is believed by many Ameri
cans residing here to have more
significance than a simple official
dropping in to see how things are getting
along.
As the time for the elections approaches
It is becoming more and more clear that
the United States Government cannot
wholly withdraw its forces and turn Cuba
over to the Cubans for self-government
upon their taking their first step in that
direction. The Cubans see that as well
as the Americans, and are becoming
restive, while the Americans in civil life
are becoming uneasy. It is plain to
everybody that should the United States
withdraw all but its moral support, there
would very soon be an Infinitely worse
condition on the island than prevailed
in the darkest days of Spanish i rule.
There have been such open mutterings at
this palpable fact that It Is more than
likely thai Secretary Root has made the
tour for state reasons. Certain It is that
the opportunity was improved to have a
series of military reviews, the first and
by far the most pretentious that; have
been had since the soldiers of the^ United
States were first quartered in Cuba. â¢'_Â¦_.
The military camp at Havana is located
at Quemados, about eight miles from the
city. It is on high ground, where a cool
ing breeze blows from the ocean, a mile
or two to the, west. The Spanish . bar
racks were in the heart of the city, but
the Americans Went down the west coast
to a most airy and well drained location,
and there established a permanent post
and named it Camp Columbia. At this
nost there are now 4000 or 5000 troops, and
they appear to find the climate agreeable,
for a finer body, physically, certainly
nev<Â»r fell under the eye of the Secretary
of War. .
Impressing the Cubans.
General Lee, commanding the district,

has" headquarters at Quemados, in a fine
Spanish house, and General \ Wood occu
pies the Governor General's palace in' H
avana. Both , the generals, and Ludlow,
Rathbone and a number of lesser digni
taries, accompanied Secretary Root, and
the occasion was, made a gala day by the
residents of Havana!*
Two infantry regiments, a battery and
a cavalry regiment passed -in review.
After the formal review the troops were
put through evolutions, which Americans
believe were Intended especially to im
press the Cubans. The cavalry ma
neuvered and the" artillery â¢ showed un
common proficiency in unllmbering and
firing volleys. The Infantry went through
a setting-up process that betokened great
proficiency in drill, all of which is be
lieved to have had effect on the Cuban
understanding. . .-"Â¦Â¦. y t~ y :j :
The situation here. ls one that is about
as unsatisfactory to Americans as it- is
possible to be. The United States Govern
ment finds itself in the position of guaran
teeing everything and benefiting in noth
ing. In the first place there appears to
have been an entire misconception in the
American mind of the nature of the Cu
ban insurgents. There" was a class of
half-informed people which delighted to
expatiate upon Cuban "patriots," ground
under the heel of despotism; of a- people
seeking freedom even as did the "Ameri
cans in 1776. The national sentiment' was
thus worked up and ; intervention pro
voked. When. the American soldiers land
ed and attempted to co-operate with the
insurgent forces they saw how very far
from ideal heroes the men were who were
making pretense of - liberating a Â¦ nation.
These people were found to be of no use
In real fighting, such as was necessary to
vanquish the Spaniards. About all the
military relations, with the Cubans that
could be sustained by our forces was -to
issue rations to -themâ and. the American
Government has been doing that in ef-
feet, ever since. As | recompense it has
gained the undisguised hostility of the
Cubans, and its people to-day stand In
the most unsatisfactory relation* to Cuba

UNITED STATES
ACTING ON ITS
OWN INITIATIVE
Berlin Rumor of a Naval
Demonstration Off Taku
Denied.
Â»
This Government Will Continue on
Its Policy to Work Alone in
the Protection of Its
Citizens.
BERLIN. March 21.â An official agency
to-day gave out a Washington dispatch
setting forth that the American warship
sent to Taku Is Intended to participate
in an eventual joint naval demonstration
should China persist in her refusal to
suppress the sects hostile to Christians.
A high official of the German Foreign
Office made the following statement this
evening:
"Germany does not Intend for the pres
ent an extension of the German sphere of
influence in the Shantung province of
China. Certainly, however, she will en
deavor to maintain order there and to
prevent her own and also the American
and French missionaries in the province
being disturbed or interfered with, but
just at the moment everything in Shan
tung is quiet and no expeditions are oc
curring or being planned."
LONDON. March 21.â The Foreign Office
to-day says there is no truth in the story
emanating from Berlin in regard to an
alleged joint naval demonstration should
China persist in refusing to put -a stop
to the hostilities against Christians in
that country.
America Is Acting Alone.
WASHINGTON. March 21.â The fact
that the State Department has consist
ently, throughout the many uprisings in
China, necessitating the presence of for
eign warships, adhered to its policy of
acting alone, is quoted here as sufficient
to indicate the error in the statement
connecting the presence of the \\ heeling
Â¦with an internatnonal demonstration. It
is pointed out that in the past the United
States has undertaken to protect all
Caucasiansâ European and American
near the port where they might be in
time of disturbance in China. Thus the
little gunboat Petrel was kept all of one
winter at Newchwang guarding not the
resident Americans alone, but Europeans
as well. The warships of foreign powers
have looked after the protection of Amer
icans as well as of their own people dur
ing the operations of one of the Chinese
secret societies. But in each case the
rule has been observed that the United
States was acting on its own motion, and,
therefore, it cannot be stated that in the
present instance the commander of the
Wheeling will act upon directions from
his own Government without being a
party to any international demonstra
tion.

It developed yesterday during the trial

eeeks to recover damages from the West
ern Turf Association that 60 long as they
contribute to the coffers of Tanforan race
track Corrigan and his associates c&re
not who occupies their pool boxes or hovr
brazen they become in their systematic
fleecing of the gullible portion of the pub
lic. Fred H. Green, secretary of tho
Western Turf Association, was on the
Et&nd again yesterday and contributed a
lew Interesting facts regarding the mac
tpement of Tanforan. Plaintiff, was will
ing to contribute additional facts of a
similar nature, but on the vigorous ob
jections of defendant's counsel he "was
not allowed to tell his story in Its en
tirety.
When the case was called Greenberg
was put on the stand and examined at
length by his attorneys, Edward C. Har
rison and Matt Sullivan. Greenberg U>l4
again the story of the manner in which
he was thrown out of Tanforan and how
he was even denied the right of entry into
the Oakland race track, "for the manage
ments of the two tracks had agreed to
enforce rules made by each." After con
cluding his story of the treatment he had
received at the tracks in answer to coun
sel's questions Greenberg proceeded to set
at rest Secretary Green's assertion that
the reason witness was denied the privi
lege of getting information at the track
upon which to compile his racing guide
was "that the Western Turf Association
was anxious that only reliable news
ehould go out to the public.
The court, however, refused to allow the
matter to be gone into in detail, ruling
that it was not an issue in the case at bar.
Green was the next witness, and al
though somewhat hostile gave some rare
Information, lie explained his action in
Issuing orders for the exclusion of Green
berg by saying "the managements of the
two tracks adhered to their agreement to
enforce the rules made by each other."
Mr. Sullivan asked Green If It was not a
fact that Joseph Rose had been ruled off
the Oakland track, but was now occupy
ing a prominent position among the
bookies at Tanforan. Green said Rose
was not ruled off the Oakland track, but
simply warned away because he had been
charged with having bribed Jockeys. As
he was not convicted of bribery the man
agement of Tanforan took no cognizance
of his alleged offense and allowed him to
cell pools at Tanforan. Green was then
asked to produce the books of the corpor
ation of which he is secretary, that the
daily receipts and expenditures of the
track might be definitely determined. He
did not heve the books in court, but this
morning he will bring them and make the
f.gures tell the true story of the financial
condition of the Western Turf Associa
tion.
Captain Callundan next took the stand
and told how he arranged his troops to
exclude Greenberj? from the track. George
H. Green, one of Callundan's men, who
threw Greenberg *ut, after tossing: several
bouquets at his prowess and great phys
ical strength and casually remarking that
had hÂ« hit Greenberg the latter, would
have been carried out hors de combat,
Â«aid that when he saw Greenberg at the
track he took him by the collar and an
other portion of his clothes, while Officer
Newman grasped two other portions, and
they dragged him to the gate and put him
out.
George \T. Pranks, a traveling man. tes
tified that he saw the officers put Green
berg out. Franks said the officers tore
Greenberc's clothes, and after cutting his
reck with their nails in search of a firm
rrip dragged him backward to the turn-
FtJles and hurled him out of the track.
Mr.' Briggs testified to the same facts,
after which an adjournment was had un
til this morning.

PETER JACKSON RETURNS
TO HIS FORMER HOME
The Veteran Will End His Rapidly
Waning Days Among . Friends
in the Australian Colonies.
Peter Jackson, one of the most finished
boxers that ever stepped Into a ring, left
last night on the steamer Mariposa for
his old home In Australia. It Is only a
mockery now to allude to him as an ath
lete, as the ravages of* disease" "have
racked his herculean frame and. left him
a wan, hollow-cheeked wreck. Unless na
ture comes to his relief and buOds up, his
wasted tissues it will not be lons ' be
fore the obituary will be written ot one
of the greatest boxers the ring has ever
produced. . ,
Peter was sick almost unto death in the
north, when friends went to his assistance
anrl arranged for him to return. 'to the
warmer climate of the Australian colo
nien. In which it was thought Jay the
only chance of prolonging his^ life.
Jackson was one of tho most popular
tnent that ever entered a ring. , He could
not be Induced to discuss his own prow
ess and ne\-er belittled an opponent. 'Al
though not well educated he had ' mixed
so much with men of the world that he
had acquired a polished manner. He was
possessed of a quick wit and was a clever,
well-informed conversationalist.

CHARLEY THORPE
GETS A FULL AT
TANFORAN PARK
Nilgar Goes Down at Start
and the Veteran Is
Badly Hurt.
Bendoran Gave the Talent a Fright
ful Reverse â The Lady Likewise
Went Wrongâ But Two
Favorites Won.
After experiencing along run of luck.
Charley Thorpe, the "grand old man" of
the saddle. â met with a mishap at Tan
foran yesterday, which will cause his re
tirement for some time. He had the
mount on Nilgar in the final event, and
as the big field broke away from the dan
gerous seven-furlong post, there occurred
a general go-as-you-please Jostling match.
In the mix-up Nilgar went down. After
tho^race his unfortunate rider was carried
to the paddock on a stretcher and later
removed to his home In town. An exam
ination revealed the fact that he had Buf
Â¦fered a broken shoulder blade and a pos
sible fracture of one of his ribs, with
lesser minor bruises. r Much, regret was
expressed over the accident, as Charley
is a general favorite, not only with the
public but with his brother riders, sev
eral of whom ran to the scene after
weighing in under the stand.
Four favorites were mowed down and
the books continue getting richer and
richer at the, San Mateo frack.. Quite the
most astounding .'downfall 'of .the entire
racing was that. of Bendoran,' in the five
and a half furlong eprlntT The big horse
carried a mint. of money at. 7 to 20, \ and
displaying no 'â¢ great amount of speed, fin
ished third. Frank*. Bell led â¢. from the
etart, just 'beating out Sardine a heck in
1:06%. The- winner wa3 8 to 1.
The win of Imp. Clonsilla in the closing
number partially atoned for some of tho
lost money. "Still there is no' gainsaying
the fact the 'talent is badly warped and
the track Is losing caste fast. . Â»Â» /
The colored boy, Bassinger, astride the 7
to 1 chance, â¢ Uterp, managed to beat the
big bunch of maidens away from the post
in the opening run, winning all the way.
Morelia, another outsider, downed- Miss
Soak for the place.' Henry on Jaxabel suc
ceeded in getting badly placed next v the
rail,' never being prominent. Â¦â¢ Â¦-'â¢'
Louis Ezell's filly. The Lady, had such
a ready money look that 7 to 10 was con
sidered a long price against her, beating
Limerick, Tekla and Sam Dannenbaum in
the mile and a sixteenth run. Marty Ber
gen dallied along with the first choice to
the stretch, only to be outflnished and
downed a head by Thorpe, with the leg up
on Limerick. , ' _/..-'.,_
Corrigari's mare, Daisy F, found another
soft berth; in the mile selling run. . Every
body, played her at short. odds, and she
galloped in ahead of Opponent. Merry
Boy finished- third, but was set back for
fouling Casdale down near the , furlong
pole; . â¢ . ; . Â¦ \
Â¦ Burns & ' Waterhouse's two-year-old
Bernato kept up the prevailing Tanforan
.fashion- t>y finishing third in the four and
'a half furlong dash at short odds. Moon
bright, owned by.Jghnny Weber, assumed
the front position on the turn for home,
breasting the tape six lengths !n advance
of Jntrada. The favorite was sect away

lieve' the bout will go the limit, basing their judgment on the
fact that both men are cautious when In the ring and take no
chance of being stopped by a wild swing. Nelll's showlnsr with
Jack O'Brien and his close attention to training when under
going the conditioning process have had some effect on the
betting. In this, however,' . he Â¦ will have little advantage over
McConnell. who has been trained by Tim McGrath. Neither
man has left anything undone that would help him In the' ring.
A sharp, scientific battle is expected. In the preliminary
bouts, which will bo of ten rounds' duration, Eddie Toy will
box Toby Irwln and Henry j Lewis will meet Al Hamilton of

better boxer. Each learned the rudiments of the . game
here, although McConnnell had the advantage of an Eastern
trip recently, when he saw the highest development of the
sport. Nelll la the favorite at odds of 10 to 8, although Mc-
Connell has a big following which Is ready to back his
chances. In the mutuels Neill has a plight call over his oppo

OFFENBACH AS
GOOD AS EVER
TASTE has changed and the popu
larity of Offenbach, once the king
of comic operators, has been seen
to cease; yet the invention, the art
and the good music are there, and it
does not take an old-fashioned ear to find
abundant melody In those familiar scores,
melody that Is still fresh and combined
with a musical treatment that makes the
frothy operas of these later days sound
like thirty cents rattled In the circulating
cup of a ferry-boat fiddler.
"The Grand Duchess" Is but one of the
many good things that old Offenbach did
for us. not the greatest, perhaps, but.lt
Is entitled to the place It fills In the cata
logue of opera comiques. It loses in
translation and suffers In being chanced
froto an Intimate satire on the little Ger
man principalities that existed prior to
the Franco-Prussian war to a' quite sim
ple and motiveless story supported. I
might say carried, by capital music.
"The Grand Duchess" is being given at
the Grand quite unpretentiously and well.
None of the. principals sins In singing or
acting to an unforgivable extent, which
being the case, there Is comfort and en
joyment to be had in the hearing of an
opera In which all should find, and I think
all can find, pleasure.
The part of the Grand Duchess Is rather
well adapted to Edith Mason, and I have
nothing but praise for her truly good
singing of "Say to- Him" In the second
act. Persse, of the tired voice, supple
mented this solo with a bit of singing that
was quite discreditable by contrast: If he
made the same conscientious effort to
sing his best that Miss Mason does his
performance would be much better than
It is. However, he does not seriously of-
Wolff, as General Bourn, Is the stereo

chestra Is even and compact and the per
formance moves along very smoothly.
The ensemble at the end of the: second
act was particularly well executed.

then Â¦ Just . above , the trunnions are two
handles In the form of dolphins curving
up from the barrel of the gun. It is Just
forward of these that the inscription of
dedication Is â¢ engraved. -It is in these
words: -...â¢.-
"Captured at Santiago de' Cuba July 17,
lS9S,bythe. Fifth. Army Corps, command
ed by Major General William R. Shafter.
and presented -by him -to 'the city and

Native Sons of the Golden West, and ac
cepted by them as a token of the valor
and patriotism of the army' of the United
States." . â¢. - -,Â¦-â¢-,... - -Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
Then every one .who had been In the
speakers' stand went to lunch with Mayor
Prelan and the police Â¦ withdrew â¢ and let
the crowd surge around the gun. It was
an object of interest to the . passing
crowds all the afternoon and evening, for
there were few who did not stop to sco
and to read the inscriptions If, bears. It
Is ten feet long and weighs six thousand
pounds. It was cast March 23, 1754. What

make an Interesting story, but it has

metal heart may reflect upon the past and
where It can do no more harm. .
Spanish weapon, but because It had been
captured by the conqueror of Santiago, a
citizen of California. '
"This cannon," the Mayor continued, Vis
a monument to historic associations^ and
as such is most acceptable to the city
of San Francisco. It will be a reminder
of the close connection between the his
tory of this State and that of Spain, and
it will be inscribed with the names of
those who have made this State possi
ble â those of Sloat and Montgomery and
Fremont and of such men." -
Frank Mattlson, grand orator of the
Native Sons, then spoke In behalf of the
order. "We will be glad to accept the
gun which speaks so eloquently of , Amer
ican valor and we shall always prize It as
one of our dearest possessions" were the
eloping words of his address.
This ended the ceremonies and then the
gentlemen came out of the stand and
gathered around the gun. the. army men
explaining to the civilians some of its
virtues as a weapon. Of Its beauties as a
work of art there Is no need of explana
tion. .It is carved with all the. fantastic
mottoes and names and crests with which
the joinmakers of the last century loved
to decorate their best work. All along
the chase there are names and crests and
army officers, public officials and officers
of the Native Sons that issued from the
Mayor's office and made its way through
the crowd to the stand, the band greet
ing their appearance with "Hall to the
Chief."
General Shafter was the first to speak.
He referred to the capture of the gun,
with a great many others, when Santiago
fell, and he told how eleven of the finest
were picked out and sent to Washington
for distribution among the States. He
applied for two for California and the
Government granted his request. One .of
them Is in Los Angeles; the other was
in the square.
"This gun," said General Shafter, "is
brought here and presented to the city
as an evidence of the valor and the glory
of the army of the United States in the
war of 1898. and, Mr. Mayor. I transfer
It to you as representing the city, that
the youth of this State may be reminded
of the patriotism and valor of the Ameri
can soldiers."
In reply Mayor Phelan made a grace
ful acknowledgment of the gift, saying
it became doubly valuable from the fact
that the gun was presented by the gen
eral who had captured it. It was not so
much, he said, because the gun was a
Morosco's ultimate recovery. A second
abscess has formed, and this will necessi
tate extreme measures. There have been
many sympathetic callers at the hospital,
but no one has been allowed to see the
patient.

THE COMMISSION
Southern Pacific Gets Into
Hot Water by Its Ar
bitrariness.
Cut Fares to Meet Competition and
Then Raised Them in Bold
Defiance of the
Law.
Â«
The Southern Pacific Company has
again overlooked the fact that there Is a
State Railroad Commission and as a con
sequence of this forgetfulness Is In a fair
Â¦way to have a large bunch of trouble un
loaded on Its hands.
Some three years ago the Huntlngton
people reduced their passenger rates from
San Francisco to San Joaquln Valley
points In order to meet the competition
that threatened them from a combination
of Valley road and Stockton ferry service.
The reduction was based on a 25-cent rate
from Stockton to San Francisco that had
been put In by the opposition. This rate
did not affect travel from valley polnta
to Stockton, but It did hit, and hit hard,
the traffic business from places like Mer
ced, Fresno and Bakersflcld to this city.
It did not only affect the opposition car
riers, who had an all-night trip on the
boat to their disadvantage as against the
quicker and more comfortable trip on the
Southern Pacific cars, but It did a great
deal of damage to the business interests
of Stockton and those places In the San
Joaquin Valley that acted as distributing
points for the consumers of the surround
ing- country-
II a. rancher or small storekeeper on the
line of the Southern Pacific was In need
of supplies he would consider that It
would cnly cost him a quarter more to go
clear through to San Francieco for his
supplies than It would to go to Stockton.
The consequence was that he would al
most Invariably come to this city and do
the purchasing that the Stockton mer
chant looked forward to for his profits.
This naturally raised a storm of protest
from the Stockton people, which was
backed up by the big wholesale bouses In
this city, whose revenues were derived
from the eales that they made to the
smaller traders In the interior.
Finally these protests became bo strong:
that the Southern Pacific Company was
forced to heed them, which it did In a
circular issued the day before yesterday
informing the public that on the 22d of
this month the limited rates between San
Francisco, Stockton and all intermediates
on main and branch lines, and from San
Francisco to all points south of Tracy
would be withdrawn and the regular com
mlspion rate once more put In force.
This action, the Southern Pacific Com
pany fancied, would do away with the
protests and complaints of the Interior
merchants and the city wholesalers, and
would at the same time allow the com
pary to profit by the increased returns
that* it would derive from higher fares.
There was one element thai the South
ern Pacific Company forgot to take Into
consideration, and that was the Railroad
Commission. It went right ahead read
juFtirg its passenger rates as though such
a body was not in existence, and In con
sequence will probably be unpleasantly
reminded that there is such a power and
that it will not brook interference with
its prerogatives, no matter from what
source the interference comes.
There is a law that says that It shall
lie with the Railroad Commission to make
and determine rates and that roads oper
ating within the jurisdiction of the com
mission must conform to the commis
sion's grading of charges. It is also pro
vided that when a road reduces its rates
in order to meet competition it cannot
again restore them to the first and
hijrher fipure without notifying the Rail
road Commission and getting such per
mission from that body.
This is ju.Â«t what the Southern Pacific
has dor.c and the Commissioners propose
to call it to account. Just what action
will be taken is not yet determined, but
will soon be. either at the regular meeting
next month or at a special one that may
bp railed to consider this particular case.
When seen last evening Commissioner
Lnumeister J=a.Â«d that he had, as yet. re
ceived no official notice from the South
ern Pacific of its having readjusted Its
valley rates, and did not think the road
would take such a step without consulting
the commission, until yesterday after
noon, when he had been Informed of the
issuance of the circulars announcing the
railroad's arbitrary act. He at once tele
phoned his associates, and Is now await
ing a conference with them, which will
probably take place in the near future..
Until the Commissioners meet nothing
definitely will be known of the step they
intend to take in order to bring the Hun
tinjrton peoj-le to a real'zation of the fact
that there is a power in the State that
even they must at least make a bluff at
bowing to.

to ask in return for the unrestricted admission of Chi
nese to any British territory upon- the same terms ;is
the subjects of other 'nations with which Great
Britain has diplomatic relations. It is safe to say
that the Australasian colonies would ; sooner sever
their allegiance to. the mother country than consent
to open their ports to the Mongolian hordes. It is
fpon questions such as these that the colonies seek
for representation in the direction of the empire's
policy. They wish to have a voice in steering the
empire clear "of entanglements which directly affect
them, and that will not be attained by a mere friendly
and informal discussion with the Australian delegates
who are to advise on the commonwealth bill, and
who have no authority to deal with matters out
side it." Â¦ > v. ' , .
It will be seen the Australians are not so loyalto
the mother country as ! to be indifferent to Australia
itself. In fact, they are in favor of the empire pro
vided they have a share in the government of the em
pire. They are not content that Great' Britain should
be the whole thing. In a short time," therefore, the
British will be called upon to decide whether they
will surrender their empire or abandon their claim
to have the exclusive right'to govern it.'
TWO TREATIES THAT SETTLE THE RIGHTS
OF PARTIES BATTLING IN THE BOER WAR
STATUS OF THE ISLANDERS.
/V/V ORGAN of Alabama, the evil genius of the
/ \ Senate and of the country, has been Â¦ heard
-,'j"t*i again. He declares all the inhabitants of our
island possessions entitled to full citizenship, and that
resistance to our authority in Cuba will be rebellion
against the United States, the same as such resistance'
is rebellion in the Philippines.
Readers of The Call will remember that we printed
signed interviews with'many hundreds of the volun
teers from many States who returned from the Phil
ippines last year. Almost without exception these
volunteers discussed fellow-citizenship for the Fili
pinos and answered "Never" to the proposition. -
The expansionists have gone from folly to folly in
;his business, and Senator Morgan has invariably led
the procession. .. . â¢ . .â
The American people will not have the islanders as
fellow citizens and free commoners. That, may as
well be understood now as later- on. To admit, them
to such status is probably the shortest road to de
struction of the republic that can be desired. It does
not mean that we will wait and put the evil day afar
oft by making them Territories, for if citizens of the.
United States in a Territory they become citizens of
any State to which they choose to resort upon fulfill
ing its law as to length of. residence.
That all of these islanders will swarm into the ex
isting States, if they be citizens, there is no doubt.
/They can spare annually the surplus of their eighteen
millions of people in such numbers as will leave far'
behind the highest annual immigration we have ever
had from Europe. If they are not fit to govern them
selves in Territories, they will come to the States and
help govern us, whether we like it or hot.
Morgan's position on Cuba is in line with his
foreign policy ideas. He and Money of Mississippi
are original annexationists. A large number of the
Democrats in both branches of Congress intend to
hold on to Cuba. For that they urged on the Span
ish war. If that party were in power we would have
full citizenship for all the islanders, as Morgan says,
"without regard to race or other conditions," and we
would have unlimited free trade with the islands.
If there is anything to be learned from experience
this incorporation into our body politic of these peo
ple will bring disaster to us, with no offsetting bene
fit to them.
i The declaration as to Cuba will probably bring
things to a head there. A strong party .follows Mor
gan in breaking our word and seizing the island, or
rather suppressing its people and staying there.
It is discovered now that the Spanish residents who
own the property want to be annexed to the United
States, and that it is only the masses of the people,
principally negroes, who want independence. But
those masses are the force that fought Spain. They
were the insurgents. They were the concentradoes;
they were the people of Cuba declared to be indepen
dent, in whose name we demanded that Spain with
draw from the island.
The Spanish residents were loyal to Spain. They
did not revolt and did not wish the independence
which we said belonged to the Cubans.
Yet Morgan declares that if the masses attempt to
gain the independence we said was already theirs, it
will be rebellion against the United States.
At least the country is thankful for these occasional
exposures of what Morgan's party will do. if it get
the power to do anything. Colonel Bryan said two
months ago that whenever we see a people fit for self
government this country can take them in. Morgan
sees eighteen millions of tropical islanders ready to
be taken in.
Sensible Americans see in this no safe solution of
the dark and dreadful problem presented to us by the
results of the Spanish war. Such Americans don't
want to govern these aliens of the tropics from with
out, nor permit them to govern us from within. Bet
ter let them profit what they may in our protection
and example, and govern themselves. â¢

AN ACT THAT HAS FAILED.
SOME time ago we directed attention to the sat
isfaction expressed by the British press in the
operation of the act requiring all shopkeepers
to provide seats for their assistants. The law went
into effect with the beginning of the year, and the ex
pectation was it would be promptly and universally
obeyed. It now appears the situation is by no means
so pleasing as was believed, and that the. shopgirls
are not much better off than they were before.
.The London Social Gazettej.iri describing the work
ing of the act after the two months of trial, says: "It
is true that when one in authority calls to inquire into
the matter he finds nothing to which he can take ex
ception. But yet no Jone ever sees the girls - ; sitting
down. The explanation is .simple. Seats are pro
vided, but no one is allowed to sit on them. The act
only says that seats must be provided. It does not
say, that assistants must be given an opportunity of
pitting on them. So - their comfort is sacrificed to
appearances, and the seats* are only used for orna
ment." Â¦:',:_' '. y:V
,On that showing a question arises as 'to what the
Government. ought to do or can do' next. The West
minster Gazette,, in commenting upon the statements
of the Social Gazette, says' if that paper knows of any
shops where orders ar e |giyen".that'the seats must not
be used it should publish them,^ in' order that "the pub
lic might refuse to patronize them. * 'That /remedy,
however, bears a closer,resembiance to" a ! boycott than
to Government regulation,, and it : is -doubtful ; if ; it
could be made effective.; Â¦'Â¦' "Â¦'-,' ' ;
The ; operation in California of the law requiring
seats for women employedrin ! shops and stores has
been more fully regarded by employers than that in
Great Britain. ' It is true there have been violations of
it,. and complaints have at times been made that it
was not fully '; enforced. Only f a : short time ' ago ' a

AUSTRALIA AND THE EMPIRE.
rROM two correspondents in Australia the Lon
don Chronicle recently published letters which
show that notwithstanding the prevailing enthu
siasm of imperial loyalty -in the colony due to the
war feeling, the Australians are by no means satis
fied with the position they occupy in the empire. They
desire "a revision of the imperial system which will
place that colony more on an equality with Great
Britain in determining the course of imperial affairs.
One of the writers declares there has been a feeling
of "alarm and unrest" throughout Australia on ac
count of a report that the Australian federation bill
is to be considered and possibly altered by the im
perial Parliament. The report was. due to a cable
gram from Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary for the
Colonies, to the Hon. Alfred Deakin of Melbourne
requesting. him and other Australian leaders to come
to London and "give assistance when the Australian
commonwealth constitution bill comes before the im
perial Parliament."- . '
Commenting upon the feeling aroused by the re
port the writer says: "So keen is the edge of public
opinion on the matter that any serious amendment
to the bill would go far to mar the 1 spirit of liberal
imperialism which the departing Governor of Victoria
so strenuously fostered during his four and a half
years of office." As an evidence of the temper of the
people he quotes the Age as saying: "Does the im
perial Government contemplate making any radical
changes in the bill, and are these delegates to assent
to such changes in the name of the colonies? That
is not to be thought of. Would Australia, as a whole,
be willing, after all the work that has been done in
convention, conference and two referendums, that the
final provisions of the Australian federal constitution
are to be assented to. by any two or three Govern
ment appointed delegates? That is outside any con
ceivable conditions. The commonwealth bill is the
accepted constitution of the Australian people. Mr.
Chamberlain knows this, and we cannot think of his
cable message as meaning more than it says."
The other correspondent sounds a still bolder note.
He not only denies the right of the imperial Parlia
ment to alter or amend a constitution adopted by the
Australian people, but he claims for Australia a right
to be heard in all imperial affairs, and representation
in the imperial Cabinet. In the course of his letter
he says: "Australasia feels _that it has been cavalierly
treated in the Samoan settlement, but a question of
far greater importance to her may at any time arise
out of the growing/desire for expansion in China-
All the Australasian* colonies put heavy restrictions in
the way of Chinese immigration, and the tendency
15 to make them even more stringent than they now
are. If Great Britain desires an open door in- China
and the free entry-of her subjects into that country.
it is perfectly reasonable for the Chinese Government
William F. Herrin seems to be in a most unfortu
nate predicament. The lawyers in the Southern Pa
cific Company think he is a politician, and the politi
cians believe that he is a lawyer. H. E. Huntington
is convinced that he is neither.
EVIDENCE PROM ARIZONA
I \ ECENTLY we called attention to the destruc-
Iâ / tion of the stock ranges ot Arizona, caused by
overstocking and using cattle and sheep as free
commoners. At that time we noted the permit, by
the Secretary of the Interior, for sheep grazing on the
Liack Mesa. Since then it seems that demand has
been made to reopen the Arizona forest reserves to
the grazing of sheep and goats. This proposition is
Leing resisted by the irrigators, who show that by
giazing the forests large areas have become barren,
the soil is washed off, and the exposed rocks increase
the aridity of the country. The rainfall has remained
rormal, but destruction of the reservoir capacity of
the forest land has wasted the water in floods and
evaporation. Maricopa County has irrigated land in
jured by the decreased water supply that is assessed
at nine millions, while all the sheep in the Territory
are assessed at less than one million.
There is but one effective remedy for this state of
things. Until it is applied all others are merely pal;
ttring with the matler. The stock ranges should be
leased and every man compelled to keep his stock on
his leasehold. He will then have a motive for pre
serving rather than destroying the natural forage
which preserves the porosity of the soil and enables
it to store wat%.r.
A Nevada sheepherder ' named Nelson has ad
dressed a letter to the National Irrigation Associa
tion. .He is president of the Nevada Wool-growers'
Association, and declares that he is opposed to irri
gation and to leasing the ranges. Two paragraphs
from his letter reveal the issue. He says: "The
proposition is to let the cattle run at large same as at
present, on the range of the sheep man, but to con
fine the sheep man to the ground he actually owns or
rents. While I believe that any law of that nature
will be ruinous to Nevada, still I will not complain
if the law applies to all alike. But to confine me to
a limit and permit my neighbor to occupy my land
and his own and the unleased public domain is giv
ing him an unjust advantage."
Of conrse no one ever proposed any such law, for
N'fvada. Arizona or anywhere else. But the people
who want to raise crops and want water to irrigate
their lands for that purpose insist that the ranges
Â«hall he leased and that all owners of cattle, horses
;ind sheep shall keep their stock on their own lease
holds. President Nelson may rouse prejudice and
cupidity by such misstatements, but he should not be
able to impede legislation thereby.
He denies that there is any water to store iri
N>vada, and says a man cannot make a living on
Nevada land, and adds: "If any one doubts let
him go to California, in the rain belt, where they do
not need irrigation, and see the heartbreaking fail
nres that have been made.' See the deserted houses
-'Â¦nd improvements." We are at a loss to know what
he means by that, unless he thinks that there is no
'awful nor gainful occupation left in the world ex
rept shecpherding. He evidently looks upon this
Stale as a proper field for monopoly by that business.
His letter, and events in Arizona, give further point
zn the warning we have uttered from time to time,
that the men of the West who want a. proper grazing
policy, and the irrigators who want agriculture and
horticulture, should rouse from their indifference and
move Congress to action.

REPUBLICAN LEAGUE CLUBS
ON April 27 . the convention of Republican
League Clubs of the State is to assemble at
Los. Angeles. It is therefore timely for all
clubs of the league throughout the commonwealth to
begin preparations for the occasion. Nor should the
activity be confined to members of existing clubs, but
Republicans in districts where there is no club should
set to work to organize one and raise its membership
to the highest number possible.
In politics, as in every, other department of endea
vor," it is organization that wins. The enthusiasm of
individual's- and the stimulus of able leadership no
doubt accomplish much, but they cannot make up for
the lack of that co-pperation which comes only from
well disciplined organized masses. The efficiency of
clubs in campaign workhas long since been demon
strated, and some of the most notable victories of the
Republican party have been due largely to the efforts
of the Jeague clubs. . â¢' . < .
At the present time the .outlook of the coming
campaign shows a bright prospect for republicanism
in all parts of the Union except in the Bourbon dis
tricts of the South. The only menace of danger which
political experts can see upon the horizon is that the
rank and file of the party may be over sanguine, of
victory. and in their assurance fail, to make the efforts
required to win it., * Against that danger the party
must now be on guard. Preparations for this strug
gle must be made as amply and as comprehensively
as those for the contest against Bryanism in 1896, for
it is to be the same fight over agaiu. and will be
waged by the Bryanites with less hope, perhaps, but
not with less passion than before. The supporters of
protection and sound money and that general Repub
lican policy upon which our present prosperity de
pends cannot afford to take chances of a reverse in
any State. They must organize for victory.
The Republican League clubs, it must be borne in
mind, have no affiliations with party factions, nor are
they supporters of the candidacy of any man or set
of men for any office. They are banded together for
the purpose of upholding Republicanism, but for no
other object. No member of the party can have any
objection to allying himself with them if he be suffi
ciently 1 earnest to desire to take an active part in the
campaign. Â¦ ' .
It is desirable there should be an efficient party or
ganization in every county, township, city, ward and
precinct, and to that end there should be in each
locality a well organized club composed of a large and
vigorous membership. It is, moreover, important
that the league convention be attended by representa
tives of the party from all parts of the commonwealth
and of all sections of the party. Existing clubs
should therefore set at once about the task of reor
ganizing and renewing tbeir activity, and new clubs
should be formed wherever they may be needed, so
that strong and influential delegations may be sent
to the league convention. That is the first campaign
work to be undertaken, and it should be entered upon
with the vim and vigor that assure victory.

London) I came across a verbatim copy of these treaties, and was delighted, as now I could seevhat the rights ot tne
parties were. Thinking that your readers may be equally interested I venture to inclose to you a copy of the essential
provisions: .. . _- _ â¢
'On examining the treaty of 1884 I found it stated it was to be "substituted for" the treaty of iBSr (see its pre
amble), so it becomes unnecesary to consult the former, as the latter thus completely takes its. place, and hence De
comes the only compact to be considered. I have added to this two English statements of England s posiUon-7-one _Dy
Sir William Harcourt and the other by Mr. -Chamberlain, expressed before the House of Commonsâ and, by taking
English views, it hardly seems that injustice could thereby be done to England. The debate was as follows: y^ '.
Sir W. Harcourtâ â¢â¢ "This amendment challenges the
Government to give an accountâ it challenges their policy in
entering upon the war. â¢ â¢ It is the object of the amendment
to extract from them some adequate explanation of the causes
-which have led to what Lord Salisbury calls our '.state of hu
miliation.' â¢ â¢ . .- : , .
â¢ - "And what a preposterous doctrine this is that the greater
the disasters In which the Government involves the country
the more certain they ought to be of Impunity. (Opposition
cheers and laughter.) â¢ â¢ . Â¦ - . - .
"The policy of 1881 and 1884 lies at the root of the whole mat
ter. â¢ â¢
"I am quite sure the Colonial Secretary has not forgotten
that I was his colleague at that time, because I was his most
earnest and constant supporter in the policy which was then
pursued. (Hear, hear.) I hope I may be allowed to state; in
words characterized by all the force and lucidity which always
distinguish the statements of the right honorable gentleman
what was the policy of 1881: Mr. Chamberlain (at that time)
went on to say: 'But these were not the main reasons making
it, as we submit, impossible to maintain the annexation of the
Transvaal.' Â¦ He thought that course was Impossible for any
Government caring for the honor as well as for the interests or
this country. It was contrary to treaty engagements. It was
contrary to the best traditions of a free country. When they
found out that the wishes and the sentiments of the Boers were
entirely misunderstood and that they had gained the Transvaal
under false pretenses, they were bound in honor to withdraw
from a position which they had ' unwittingly and wrongfully
taken up, and he could not understand how those who talked so
glibly of the honor of the country should fair to see that the
greatest pain and humiliation would be in maintaining a high
handed breach of faith and destroying the Independence ot a-peo
ple whom they had solemnly engaged to respect. (Opposition
cheers.) That was the policy of 1881 as declared by Mr. Cham
berlain. Ido not know if he has altered his opinion, but I ad
here to mine, and I am as proud of the policy to-day as I was
then. (Opposition cheers.) ....
"There have been other governments since then. There was
the government of Lord Salisbury, and by the mouth of Mr. W.
H. Smith it decried that they could not pretend to interfere
with the internal government of the Transvaal outside the con
ventions. Thesame thing was said by the late Under Secretary
for the Colonies in the government of Lord Rosebery, and that
was the situation In 1895, when this government undertook the
management of affairs. It might be said that, a great deal had
happened between 1881 and 1895. , (Hear, hear.) There had
grown up the population of Johannesburg, the grievances of
the Uitlanders had become acute, and the conventions were no
longer applicable to the situation. Was that the view taken by
this Government in 1895? In 1896, by an almost singular coinci
dence, the policy of the Government was declared by the same
voice which declared the policy of the Government of 1881. The
Colonial Secretary was then again the organ of the party which
he had Joined, as he had been the organ of the party he had
left. (Laughter.) His view was precisely the same. In 18S1 ne
pointed out the dangers and perils which would arise from a
war to enforce the internal reforms in the Transvaal, the Infi
nite dangers and perils which would accrue to this country; and
he said In 1596: 'To go to war with President Kruger to enforce
upon him reforms In the internal concerns of the state which
successive Secretaries of State have repudiated all rights of
Interferenceâ that would have been a course of action as im
moral as It would have been unwise.' (Hear, hear.) He- then
proceeded to explain the exact relation between the British ana
the Transvaal Governments created by the conventions, and
said that the only right Is one. of friendly representation. In a
formal manner he also declared that 'since the convention of ISS4
her Majesty's Government has recognized the South African
republic as a free and independent Government as regards all
Its internal affairs ', . . . .
"It la quite plain, then, that In 1895 and 1896 the present ad
ministration regarded the situation in that respect as In exactly
the same position as it was placed fifteen years before. That
was the policy of the Government up to 1896, but it has been
radically altered since, and it is to the reversal of that policy,
in my opinion, that this war is due. (Opposition cheers.) Ne
gotiations went on for a time, but at last they were broken
off and you (Mr. Chamberlain) said, 'We will inform you what
our terms are.' It has been said that you thought peace was
possible and even probable under those circumstances. How
came you to think that? True, the phrase was used, 'We will
respect their Independence,' but that was a mockery. -The
leader of the House said he In common with all best opinions in
South Africa expected President Kruger to yield. Where did
you -collect 'the best opinion in South Africa' from? We have
been told that we are to place implicit confidence In the man on
the spot. . The man on the spot was not 'the best African opin
ion.' (Opposition cheers.) He was a newcomer to South Africa,
with little experience. The 'man in the street' â many men in
the streetâ knew a great deal more about the situation than the
man on the. spot. The great misfortune was, and one of the
causes of this war, that the only men consulted were men on
one side of the street (opposition cheers)â that side which was
inhabited by the authors of the raid. (Renewed opposition
cheers.) There was one other source of 'best African opinion'
at homeâ l suppose the helots who inhabit Park lane. (Laugh
ter.) In my opinion that was not 'the best South African opjn
icn' which misled you." â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢â¢.-
Mr. Chamberlainâ Does the right honorable gentleman mean
to assert that the persons to whom he refers were consulted by
the Colonial Office and no others?
Sir W . Harcourtâ l have asked what was the best South
African opinion,' and I say that is not the best. (Ministerial
laughter and Irish cheers.) There was another South African
opinion which was a great deal better. The Prime Minister of
Natal pointed out the alarm that was felt at the prospect of
war and at the injury It would impose upon. his own State, and
he asked you, if you could, to avoid it. Then there was the
more Â¦ remarkable protest of President Steyn. who said. "For
God's sake tell us what your terms are and do not menace us
by placing troops upon the frontiers of the Free State and the
Colony " But you would not state terms, and you did place
troops there. The whole spirit In which military preparations
and everything else have been made has been contempt for .the
character of the Boers and their resources. The â¢ Governmnt
dealt with them as If they were inferior people, whom they had
only to Intimidate. Your experts told you of their /military
forces but there seems to have been an element which above
all ought to have been taken into accountâ namely, the Indom
itable energy of a free people fighting for their Independence.
(Irish cheers.) â¢ â¢
"You will have 200,000 men in the field. Of course the victory
is In your hands; you can subjugate the Dutch race in South
'Africa. (."Hear, hear," . and "No, no," from the Nationalist
"Lord Salisbury in his speech pointed out the dangerous na
ture of the doctrine which suggested that It was our duty to
take everything we could, to fight everybody and make a quar
rel of every dispute, and warned the country against that rash
ness which had more than once been the ruin of great nations.
We have been told that we shall derive many. le3 , son^ f J2??JnL

But there Is another lesson which far more concerns the ' 8afÂ«y
of this country, and that Is not to exasperate by an arrogant
and Insulting demeanor those whom we desire to De our
friends." (Opposition cheers.) â¢ â¢ â¢ ' ,w._
Mr. Chamberlain said: "Every man who addresses us In this
debate must form his own judgment of what it J 9 a flt * ln * f"**
useful and patriotic to say on such an occasion, at aucn a time
and In such an assemblage. The right honorable senVem&n
who has just sat down has no doubt Formed his own standard.
i will only say that I think to-morrow the country will diner

tv hat Is the message which the right honorable gentleman
brings to his country? â¢ â¢ He enters upon a critical examina

and unjust. (Irish cheers.) , ' . "..^ â¢__.â¢_â
"How shall I deal with these criticisms against the PÂ«Â»cy

I might leave right honorable gentlemen on. the front ben en

answer to Sir R. Reid and Sir Edward Grey to answer the right
'honorable gentleman who has Just sat down. I might refer to
the fact that these right honorable gentlemen who have taicen
' this critical view of the proceedings of the Government have not
added one new fact or argument or suggestion to what tne.
said at great length and' to which we replied at equal length

to be dragged through that issue, when we have more important
and urgent matters to discuss? (Ministerial cheers.) Although
I refuse to be drawn into a discussion of petty details (Minis
terial, cheers), yet I do feel that those who are losers by this
war. those especially who have lost friends or relatives, are
entitled to have it Insisted upon again and again whenever the
question is raised that this war Is Just and necessary. (Irish
cries of "Oh. oh." and Ministerial cheers.) I want the House
for a few minutes to look at the matter broadly, and not to stop
to consider shreds and patches of the subject, but the general
drift of events and the general current of policy.
' '*. PEDDLING IN EDDIES. ,Â£* !
"We have to watch the river as it flows to the sea and not to
waste time in peddling In eddies, which seem to but do not de
lay Its course. Speaking from that point of view, I say that the
issues as between Boer and Briton, between this country ana
the South African republics, are great and real issues and not
technical issues. , They do not stand upon the trivialities or de
bate and are not to-be considered as if it were a civil case in a
civil court. (Hear, hear.) The right honorable gentleman, I
will do him the Justice to say, saw that these issues cannot be
discussed as they are sought to be discussed by the terms of
this amendment, by confining yourselves strictly to the year
1895, when the Government became responsible for South
African affairs. These Issues were there long before 1595. even
before 1881, before the raid, the Bloemfonteln conference and tha
franchise question. - Â¦Â¦Â¦ _ .Â¦
". And I want to point out that their (the Boers ) remedy for
the difficulties which I found the moment I came Into office was
a five years* franchise. â¢ â¢ â¢â¢
"The difficulties between ourselves and the Transvaal are
not the work of one Government. â¢ â¢ They are Inherent in
the circumstances, in the great differences which exist between
the Boer character and the British character, between Boer
civilization and British civilization, and between Boer education
and British education. (Cheers.) There you will find the root
cause of all that has happened. What has been the Boer pol
cy? lam not talking of conspiracy. The Boer aspiration from
first to last has been to get rid of every shred and vestige of
British supremacy and substitute for It a Boer supremacy. â¢ â¢
A CONTKST FOR SUPREMACY.
"But this must be marked. It was a contest for supremacy.
Yes; but what kind of a supremacy? The supremacy of thÂ«
Boers means, as we know, the Inferiority of every other race.
(Hear hear.) Our supremacy, so far as wÂ« have been able to
use it, has been used and will be used in order to secure the
equality of the white races and justice for the black. (Cheers.)
There was the issue then. It was a contest for supremacy dat-
Lng back I know not for how many years and for a different kind
of civilization. That issue had got to be tried: that battle had
got to be fought; one or the other party had to give way if
peace was to be preserved. (Hear, hear.) â¢ â¢ â¢
'^Vhen we came into office we felt very quickly that a solu
tion must be found. (Hear, hear.) Things could not go on with
a rapid and daily increase In the hostility between the .two
taces. That was the worst feature of the situationâ the growing
feeling of dissatisfaction and irritation between people who
ought to have lived amicably together, and who had as a rule
previously done so. The time had come when in some way or
ether this long-standing difference must be settled. We believed
then and we hoped to the last that a peaceful settlement could
be attained. We hoped that when President Kruger saw how
little it was we asked and how determined we were to have It
he would give .way. (Hear, hear.) â¢ â¢
"Our demands were moderate. â¢ â¢
"Now. this is my proposition. The war la a Just, a righteous
and a necessary war. (Cheers and Nationalist dissent.) The
opinion of the Irish Nationalist members Is nothlnp. (Hear.
h<?ar.) â¢ â¢ Ido not. therefore., appeal to them. But I do appeal
to the party opposite, and I ask them. Do they say that this
â¢war is just and necessary and righteous? (Some cries of "No.")
â¢ â¢ w> know they are divided. â¢ â¢ When you 'deplore a want
of Judgment, foresight and knowledge' you Imply, if you do not
say in words, that the war mljcht have been prevented. (Irish
cheers.) A war that could have been prevented is an unnecea
jtarywar, and I am not here to anrue that an unnecessary war
can ever be a just war. That beinsr the case, I proceed to ask
a" question. Why have not the gentlemen who entertain these
views the courage of their convictions? Why do not they vote
against the war? â¢ â¢
VBut I take it that like us. having regard to what has hap
pened, having regard to' the evidence that we have been dally
increasing as to the enormous preparation* of the Boers, and to
the evidence of a carefully prepared plan for the Invasion of
British coloniesâ (lrish laughter.) .â¢ â¢
"I Â»ay, speaking for the Government, that in so far as In us
lies there shall be no second Majuba. (Ministerial chÂ«ers.)
Never again with our consent if we have the power, never again
shall the Boer be able to erect In the heart of South Africa a
citadel whence proceed disaffection and race' animosity to en
danger the paramountcy of Great Britain. (Ministerial cheers.)
Never again shall he be able to treat an Englishman as If hÂ©
belonged to an Inferior race. (Ministerial cheers.) â¢â¢ â¢. Â¦
"We are advancing steadily, if slowly, to the realization of
that great federation of our race which will inevitably raako
for peace and liberty and justice."

SOCRATES.
His father was Sophroniskus, a sculptor.
It was said that he modeled a group of
graces exhibited in . the Acropolis.
Diogenes tells us that while he worked
with his father he also attended the lec
tures of the philosophers, Anaxagoras and
Archelaus. So diligent and interested was
he that a rich Athenian, recognizing him
in his father's shop, determined that a
philosopher should not be lost In a carver
of images and supplied him with money to
pursue his studies. I He did not live, how
ever, above the earth, though he loved
abstract speculation. . He accepted his
place as a citizen and performed his duties
as a soldier admirably. He served in the
army of Potldaea (B. C. 432) and at Delium
and Amphlbolus (B. C. 424). His fortitude
under privation and his courage before
danger were as marked as his loyalty and
high purpose. When his pupil, Xenophon,
was In grave danger he bore him in â¢ his
arms from the field of battle. He married,
as- we know, though his wife, Xantlppe,
may have suffered in -popular estimation
much In the same way as her husband
did. She has become a type of shrewish
GOLDEN AGES OF* LITERATURE.
wives, as he was made a type of preten
tious philosophers. Her side of the story
will never be heard. ,
Socrates became more and more con
vinced that he ha* a spiritual mission to
fulfill. He believed that the Deity apoke
to him through the medium of his genius,
or daemon.. He felt that this daemon
directed him unerringly; he was earnest
and sincere, and he desired to Influence
society by bringing the young to him. The
greatest of his pupils were Plato, Xeno
pnon and Alcibiades. He waa a teacher
to those who were Intimate with him, but
his position was that of a public lecturer
to constantly chansring crowds rather
than that of a professor who delivered
lectures, systematically arranged, to onÂ»
set of students. He was the founder of
no school, but his Influence permeated
many schools. We know his teaching
best through his wonderful disciple.
Plato, who represented the speculative
side of his mind as Xenophon, as Dr.
Brown In his excellent "History of Greek
Classical Literature" says, showed the
practical side.
The satire aimed at Socrates by Aris
tophanes. In the "Clouds.' had nothing to
do with the persecution of the philosopher
by his political enemies. He was sup
posed to be against democracy, although
he had been neutral In politics. The son
of Pericles, executed by the state, had
been his friend. Alcibiades and Critlasâ
Innovators against the constitution of So
lonâwere beloved by him. But when he
had Interfered in politics it had been to
save the shedding of innocent blood. He
had refused to consent to the death of the
younger Pericles; he did his utmost to
save both Theramines and Leon of Sala
mls from the fury of the mob. It was
not strange that he waa hated, for he
never hesitated .to tell unpleasant truths.
He was satirical, therefore he "mocked
the nation"; he did not reverence the old
poets as sacred, therefore he corrupted
the education of the youth of the nation.
His enemies accused him. and by a vote
of 2SI to 276 he waa declared guilty. He
might have bought hia liberty for a.heavy
fine; he refused; nor would he violate the
law by escaping. His apology, so ele
vated, dignlned and manly, is one of the
masterpieces in the literary records of the
world. He drank the hemlock and died
a- martyr to rlghteonsness. needing only
the light of Christian revelation to be a
perfect example tcr all coming ages*.
The influence of Socrates * resulted In
the formation of fixed systems; It perme
ated the teaching of the stoics and cynics
and the schools of Plato and Aristotle.
As Plato was his pupil, so Aristotle was
Plato's, though they differed In many
things. He was the first to Introduce tlia
element of accuracy into Investigation.
He insisted on definition and classifica
tion. Every term in. philosophy or ethics
must be distinctly defined. He asksrt
questions till ignorance grew weary and
gave up the ghost. This unrelenting
search for the essential meaning of s
thing is. the basis of the Socratlc method
of continues qnjstlons. He found all
previous attempts at philosophy vatrua
and unsatisfactory. Socrates held that
the soul Is vital; that It has a mortal as
well as an Immortal element, and that
truth and morality are real. He accept:?
the existence of a supreme being without
inquiry. The intellectual part of the soul
Is a part of the supreme mind. Socrates
held that knowledge was virtue and that
no man would willingly remain Ignorant
if he knew that Ignorance was wrong or
that ignorance kept him from knowing
what waa right. To perfect the intellect,
to know, was the aim. of life. Aristotle,
later, refuted thi9 doctrine, which
Socrates had never clearly explained. To
Socrates ethics and the study of human
ity were much above the study of the
physical sciences.
The teaching of Socrates Influenced not
orly the systematic scholastics of the
Roman empire, but the great systems of
St. Thomas Aquinas asd Duns Scot us.
Aristotle's philosophy waa practically
adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas, and the
tendency of the best thinkers of the mid
dle ages to put moral and ethical ques
tions first was Influenced from Socrates.
The Cyrenalc school of Artstlppun.
which held that present pleasure wu the
end of life, was the offspring of thoea
Socratic theories which were dangerous
because Socrates had not sufficiently ex
plained or developed them. The school of
the cynics was founded by another pupil
of Socrates, whose name was Antlsthenes.
His school combated the' tenets of Arla
tippus; his teaching wag ethical and gen
erally composed of objections. Ha â¢ as
serted firmly, against the opinions of his
time, that there was one God without an
earthly body.
The study of the Ufa and lessons - of
Socrates, especially as presented by Pla
toâand here let me recommend all Pro
fessor Jowett's translationsâcannot fall
to broaden the mind and make one more
in love Tfltb. "divine philosophy."

PROVING WELBURN'S
OFFICIAL SHORTAGE
The Trial . Against Bondsmen Willey
and Farmer in Progress Before
Judge Morrow.
The suit brought by the Government
against Stanley Willey and Henry Fr-rm
er, bondsmen of O. M. Welburn as.a dis
bursing officer of the Government, to re
cover $16,000, the alleged shortage of Mr.
Welburn, was Â¦ on; trial before . United
States Circuit Judge Morrow and a jury
yesterday. According to the rules 3f the
court, thÂ§ United' States Attorney must
Â¦ prove the shortage by witnesses, &iA
therefore the case against Welburn must
be practically tried over again.
" Nellie F. O'BÂ»ien and Miss M. E. Con
nell were on the stand during the fore
noon session. Their testimony tended to
show that they signed vouchers for, seJ
aries larger than those that they actually
received.
In the afternoon Mrs. A. G. Drlscoll
was Called by the counsel for the Govern
ment to show that Miss Mary McCarthy,
since deceased, was sick, and confined to
her room during certain months when
vouchers for salary were filled out for
her. Mrs. Driscoll testified .that Mis?
McCarthy was not paid at all.
George E. Dabovich testified that he
signed a blank voucher for services from
February 14 to February 28, 1895, and that
he was paid $15. The voucher was after
ward filled In with the figures $58 33.
E. C. Aiken testified that he worked
under Welburn as a Deputy Collector of
Internal Revenue and received $25 per
month during the whole period from Aug
ust 1896, until June. 1597, with the excep
tion of May, 1897. when he did not re
ceive anything. The vouchers showed
payments averaging from $79 to $85 per
.month. . .

TEN SCAVENGERS
WITH UNCOVERED
CARTS ARRESTED
Police Found Health Order
Defied in All Parts of
Disease Cterms Were Blowing With
out Hindrance From the Garbage
Wagons, Loaded to Their
Fullest Capacity.
The police had no difficulty yesterday in
finding scavengers who were violating the
ordinance concerning the collection and
transportation of refuse and 'garbage.
They were discovered in all parts of the
city and their defiance of the plain pro
visions of the ordinance was so glaring
that . it could not Â¦be overlooked. \
The Call directed attention to the dan
gers to which the public have been wil
fully subjected and the authorities have
begun to attend to their duty. The mer
chants of the city are loud In their praises
of The Call's action in this matter. They
are now wondering how the Board , of
Health can square itself with the public,
for all the blame of letting uncovered,
vile smelling carts travel through the city
distributing germa of disease Is laid at
the doors of. that Incompetent body.
The scavengers' licenses are issued in
the months of January -and July and the
present Board of Health is trying to. shift
its responsibility to the old board. The
fact is. however, that licenses have been
recommended improperly since the pres
ent * board came into office. The provi
sions of the law are plain. First the
board must have every scavenger cart,
for which license is asked, thoroughly
examined before issuing a license. - Then,
the license having been issued, the law
provides further, that the Health Officer
is empowered to notify the Collector of
Licenses to cancel the license in case of
infraction by., the holder of the sanitary
regulations imposed by the Board of Su
pervisors and the Board of Health.
As heretofore stated, the ordinance con
taining these provisions was adopted July
13, 1898, and was approved by the Mayor,
but there has never before been any effort
to enforce it. The Board of Health has
been blind to. what every one else; could
see. The arrests made by. the police yes
terday and Tuesday amply prove that The
Call was correct .in all its statements
made concerning the violations of law.
The greatest interest /will- now attach to
such action as the courts may take. .It
is hoped, that the scavengers will be com
pelled to obey the law.
Ten scavengers have been arrested In
two days. Those arrested yesterday are:
G. B. Paganinl, arrested on City Hall
avenue by Policeman Naylor ; D. Bozzo
roni, arrested at Ninth and Folsom streets
by Policemen Kelly and O'Connor; Lulgi

SUGAR BOAT WITH AUXILIARY GAS ENGINES.
The auxiliary schooner Eclipse, which Is to sail shortly for Honolulu, has
the largest gasoline engine aboard ever built in the United States and probably
in the world. It was built by the Hercules Gas Engine Company and 1b a three
cylinder, vertical type of 150 rated and 178 actual horse power. , Coming- â¢ down
from Benlcla the schooner made six knots against the tide and with the en
gines only running half power. Â¦ ; . . >
The Eclipse is fitted with a two-cylinder vertical engine and hoist, with con
nections to capstan, which will handle cargo, sails and anchor.
The Eclipse is a sister boat to the Surprise, whlch^was also fitted with a
Hercules engine. Both vessels are for the inter-island trade and will "carry sugar

XI. SOCBATES.
BY MAURICE FRANCIS EG AN, LUD.
If you read the "Clouds" of Aristophanes
you will find a " caricatureâ a very amus
ing oneâ of the philosopher Socrates. This
comedy was played 423 years before the
coming of Christ, and many translations
have been made of it. In it is presented
the popular impression of what Socrates
was. Aristophanes attacks the sophists
in the "Clouds," and makes Socrates their
representative. The truth is that Socrates
waa really the enemy of the sophists, who
made it their business to teach young
men how to get on in life. Their motto was
that "the end justifies the means." They
taught rhetoric as well as the methods of
business; they were expert in sharp prac
tices, and aimed only for material suc
cess. They called themselves philosophers
in the sense that they perfected the sci
ence of how to gain the advantages of
material life, while leaving high morality
out of the process. And. they were philos
ophers who developed the art of trying to
make black appear white if it suited their
purpose. Socrates was opposed to all this;
he was a philosopher, for he loved wis
dom and he sought to find laws that gov
ern human minds by the examination of
his own; but he was more a social re
former than a philosopher. In B. C. 423 it
was generally acknowledged that Athen
ian society needed reformation, and Aris
tophanes was right in attributing much of
the degeneration to the immoral teaching
of the sophists. As a comic writer It suit
ed him to assume that all philosophers
were sophists, and that Socrates, who
was suspected of not believing in the
puerile gods of Greece, was the chief of
them. As sophist had become a name for
all teachers of philosophy, Aristophanes
had some. excuse for his thoughtless rail
lery of the barefooted, carelessly dressed
and absent-minded Socrates.
Socrates was born B. C. 465, at Athens.

SEEKSDEATH
FROM DECK OF
A FERRY-BOAT
Unknown Man Ends His Life
at the Bottom of the
Bay.
The Schooner Maid of Orleans Col
lides With the Revenue Cutter
Bear and Both Are Some
what Damaged.
Another unfortunate . has sought sur
cease from sorrow In the waters of the
bay. An unknown man Jumped overboard
from the ferry-boat Oakland during the 1
p. m. trip from this city yesterday, and
although all efforts -were made to rescue
him they were without avail. He was
never seen after . striking the. water and
the supposition is that he had weighted
himself before making the fatal plunge.
The only clew to his identity was an old
weather-beaten Fedora hat; which he left
on the after deck of the Oakland. , Â¦.'.Â¦Â¦;-. â¢* ;v!; v!
The Oakland left this side at 1 p. m.
Almost simultaneously the tug Vigilant,
bound for the naval station at Goat Isl
and, and the sternwheel steamer Emma
bound for Oakland; left Jackson-street
wharf. The tide was flooding at the time
bo the Oakland had to head toward Alca
traz. In consequence, when the man
jumped from the Oakland all three boats
were close together. The Vigilant and
Emma bore down toward the Oakland,
while the latter lowered a boat. .A- thor
ough search, lasting nearly a* quarter, of
an hour was made, but no trace of the
suicide could be found. Eye-witnesses of
the disaster say the man was shabbily
dressed, but looKed like a gentleman down
on his luck. â¢
The schooner Maid of Orleans was In
collision with the revenue cutter Bear
yesterday. The Orleans was coming in
from Port Blakeley with a load of lum
ber, and while rounding to off Powell
street wharf, crashed into the Bear. The
latter" s.mizzen rigging was carried away
and a couple of piantcs on the starboard
quarter were stove In, while the schooner
lost her bowsprit, Jibboom and all her
headgear. All the damage was done In a
few minutes and the vessels then. cleared
themselves without assistance.
The French bark Emilie Galline arrived
from Swansea yesterday atter a passage
of 257 days. On September 30 and- October
1 she was caught in a succession ai gales
oil the Horn, during which the "oreyard
was carried away and the wheel 'damaged.
On October 29 the bark put intu Rio de
Janeiro for repairs, and was not ready to
get away again until December 1. She
was 110 days making- the run from Klo to
San Francisco.
The Harbor- Commissioners met yester
day and made Senator Sam Braunhart,
ex-Port Warden, a wharfinger. , He re
places Colonel Tom 1 Deasy, who has ef
ficiently held down the post at Fremont
strtet for a number of years. John S.
Hogan, a brother of Henry Hogan, once
District Attorney of Napa County, was
also made a wharfinger, vice J. D. Wal
kup, who has resigned. The contract for
erecting a shed over the new Santa Fe
ferry slip was let to Newson & McNeil for
$1437. The bid of H. R. Rood & Co. for
supplying the piles required by the com
mission for the next six months was ac
cepted.
The steamer Marlposa sailed for Aus
tralia last night. She could not take all
the freight that was offering, but there
were not many passengers. Among those
who went away was W. E. Mlghell, man
aging owner of the California Shipping
Company. About eight of the fleet newly
purchased by the company will be In
Honolulu during the next five weeks and
Mr. Mighell wants to inspect them. The
Henry a. Hyde:, which was damaged by
fire during the voyage from Baltimore to
Honolulu, will also receive his attention, j
1 The California Shipping Company mode
another purchase through -Mr. Mighell
yesterday.' It now owns the ship Rence,
now -on her way from the Orient to New
York. She is a good, stout vessel of IS2B
tons net burden and will be a welcome ad
dition to tht> coast fleet.
Captain Goodman of the schooner Rob
ert Lewers is to take command of the ship
Wallace B. Flint, recently purchased by
Alexander & Baldwin for the sugar trade.
She is now on her way to Honolulu, and
Captain Goodman will probably meet her
there on his arrival in the Lowers. The
latter vessel has been detained here nearly
three weeks, owing to quarantine and a
death. The cabin boy, a Japanese named
Hernano, was dying with consumption
when the schooner reached port. Quaran
tine Officer Kinyoun instructed the immi
gration officer not to land the man, so he
remained aboard and died Tuesday night.
Captain Goodman wanted to send the re
mains to the Morgue, but the officials

to be remembered that such a movement is
a necessary forerunner of the broader and
more comprehensive advance which comes wlth^
an active speculation. The reversion of the
Third Avenue railroad to the strong hands of
the Metropolitan affords not a little relief to
all circles in Wall street as not only removing
a disturbing Influence from the stock market,
but business circles generally. The speculative
movement of to-day has some basis in the
relief, afforded by this development in Third
Avenue affairs. The shorts in this stock spent
another bad day, the price running up to 112
and fluctuating between that and 100. The
other local stocks were active, but showed a
notable tendency toward relapse late In the
day. The convincing evidence that Third Aye- |
nue stock is cornered leads to diligent efforts
on the part of the bear operators caught short
to effect a private settlement. The possibility
of such a result makes the professional traders
timid and cautious about operating in the
stock after the recent violent advance. There
was a aisposition to refrain from action on I
the operations elsewhere in the list while
Third Avenue was going through its erratic
changes. It was after the stock had become
rather quiet that the aggressive demand de
veloped for the Paclflcos, including Missouri
Pacific. Southern Pacific, the Baltimore and
Ohio stocks and Norfolk and Western. Balti
more and Ohio and Union Pacific were easily
the leaders of the movement, the former ad
vancing an extreme 4% net and the latter 2VÂ«.
There were sharp gains In less active stocks,
including Wheeling and Lake Erie, Great
Northern preferred. Chicago Terminal Trans
fer. Minneapolis and St. Louis and a few ,
others. London bought stocks here llberally
and sterling exchange eased off as a result.
New York exchange at Interior points was
rather easier, but the local money market
showed no hardening tendency.
Dealings in bonds were small and price
changes were irregular. Total sales, par value,
$2.0Â«l.000.
United States 3s, old 4s and 5s advanced %.
and the new 4s declined % in the bid price.

Dried Fruit in Nezv York.
The New York Commercial says: "Prunes
are quiet, with sales limited to â¢mall lots,
rarely exceeding 100 boxes. Most orders are
for from twenty-five to fifty boxes. The sup
plies oa the Coaet are held to be compar
atively light, except large sizes, and the
probability is that everything will be cleaned
up before the next crop is ready for distribu
tion, with the exception previously noted. The
conditions under which business is carried on
are unchanged, and no Immediate Improvement
is expected.
â¢â¢Raisins crttlnue dull, with small orders
received only. There are said to be about
115 cars in association sweat boxes, but most
of them will go to the wineries. The bulk of
toe supply is composed of the lower grades.
Orient* and Pacifies, and demand for them Is
light at present. It is expected that there will
be a better trade later, but at present the
situation presents no encouraging feature.
â¢Teaches are barely steady at about pre
vious rrtcee. but movement Is slow and buy
ers are not prepared to make large purchases.
Holders are under the impression that buyers
will be compelled to accept their terms and
therefore refuse to make concessions though
eiight reductions in quotations would cause
a good many orders to be placed. No cheap
caches have been found yet.
â¢Apricots sell only in a retail way. but
prices are well maintained. Nearly everything
It in second hands and second hand holders are
net urgent tellers."
Xezv York Money Market.
Henry Clews 1 New York circular says: "Con
ditions affecting general business are unusually
satisfactory. Industrial, agricultural and trans
portation interests are all actively employed,
and there are yet no Indications of abatement.
The most significant event of the week was,
of course, the enactment of the geld standard
bill into law. That buries the sliver Issue;
puts the stamp of honesty upon United States
obligations, and removes forever the distrust
which had for years threatened to undermine
American credit, and which Just four years
ago brought us to the verge of disastrous
panic. The effect "of the bill upon the money
irou-ket will be felt gradually; the first result
being the Increase of circulation from SO to 100
per cent of par value of bonds. Much harm is
being done by sensational calculations of the
amount of inflation the new bill will permiL
Usually these statements have been put out
by unscrupulous or irresponsible parties who
wieh to stimulate public buying of stocks
through spreading exaggerated Ideas of the
probable additions to our currency. As al
rtady stated in these advices It will be some
time before the amount of new circulation
reaches J100.000.000. if it ever touches that in
rress- under present conditions. In view of
the enormous expansion of business and the
Increased demand for small notes for retail
t.urpoM* there is not much Inflation in this
Juni This addition, however, is likely to
aSord important relief at a time when most
ne'-Jed, viz.: for the crop movement next
au.umn. The high prices of Government bonds
Jftsen the inducements for Eastern banks to
tÂ»ke out additional circulation; but this will
be a smaller factor in the West and South,
where higher rates of Interest prevail. In
those sections circulation can be Issued with
greater profit than here, and it is precisely
there where considerable additions are most
needed Should this prove the course of affairs,
as seem* most likely. It will lessen the de
mands upon Eastern banks to that extent and
so diminish the possibilities of tension here.
The monetary situation, however, will bear
watching when the ui-ual fall demands assert
themselves. At the moment the money mar
ket le adverse to increased buying of stocks;
a poor bank statement being anticipated; and
more comfortable conditions cannot be expected
until the April settlements are over."

was not very broad, the demand being re-,
etricted to comparatively few stocks and there
nxÂ« not much evidence of what is called . in
Wall street public interest in the stock mar
ket. The buying was undoubtedly based, how
ever, on the expectation that the public will
shortly come into the stock market. It is con
trary to the custom of this outside public . to
come in and buy stocks when prices are at
an invitingly low level. They wait until a
rise is in full progress and apparently the
present movement has been inaugurated with
a view to affording an object lesson ' In in
creasing values. The price movement to-day
war actively manipulated and- was carefully
nursed. It is based primarily upon. the gen
erally prosperous condition for business, the
lilrb level of railroad earnings, which is be

relaxation in the money market. ' 'While ' the
movement thus far is confined "to the taking

Boston . Wool : Market.
BOSTON. March 21.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
There has' been more Inquiry for wool during
the -week under review and the tone of the mar
ket Is rather steadier.? There, has been no ad
vance in price, but the downward tendency Â¦in
values appears to be temporarily arrested, at
any rate. The market seems to have settled
udod a basis on which actual, business can be
consummated to some extent and the general
feeling pervading the trade certainly shows
more hopefulness and Â¦ confidence. No* great
amount of business has been done, however,
and If it were not for a large sale of a million
pounds reported by a certain well-known house
the business of the week would foot up a pretty
small total. On the average there has been a
decline of 6@7% per cent of domestic wool from
the top edge touched by the market . last No
vember/but for the time being the market is
In a steady position as to prices.
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
3.007.000 pounds domestic and 588,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 3,595,000 pounds, against
a total 0/ 1,907,000 pounds for the previous week,
and a total of 2,390,300 pounds for the corre
sponding week last year. Â¦
Sales since January 1 amount to 38,030,000
pounds, against 41,064,000 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year.
London 'Wool Sales. '
LONDON, March 21.â At the wool auction
Fales 13,055 bales were offered. The attendance
was good and there were fairly representative
catalogues.- A good collection of merinos and
crossbreds were taken by the home trade..
American reoresentatives were the chief pur
chasers; Continental buyers were cautious.
There were large withdrawals of scoured locks
and pieces, which attracted the attention of the
French and German representatives, . and sold
at slightly Improved prices. Cape of Good
Hope and Natal wools were fairly competed for
at a farthlnz decline.

W. S. Goodfellow s
Startling Charge
Met by a Perfect
Storm of United
Opposition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, March TL
THE charges of unprofessional
duet aad breach of confidential re
lations made by Attorney W. S.
- Goodfellow against Attorney Guy C.
Earl of the firm of Bishop & Wheeler
Â¦were met to-day In Judge Ogden's court
hy the full strength of the accused attor
ney's legal connections. Mr. Goodfellow
reiterated his belief that there had been
Ir.fonnation divulged by former Senator
Karl which led to the filing of the action
against the Varney estate trustees, while
The attorneys on the accused's side piled
In. evidence to show that Attorney Earl
had no knowledge that the litigation
would be brought untU after the com
r>!aint was filed by the Varney heirs
Â£ gainst the trustees.
Because of the eerions nature of the
charges aad the eminent position at the
tar of both sides, and at special request
cf counsel. Judge Opden had Judge Ells
worth to sit in hearing on the motion to
disqualify Bishop &. Wheeler from trying
the Varney contest.
The result of the day's work was to
rrfr.c out in full detail the history of the
vay the Varney estate litigation got into
The office of Bishop & Wheeler, according
in the statements of Ctoarles S. Wheeler,
the testimony of Attorneys Archie J.
Tr'at and Senator Earl. Mr. Wheeler,
a?f=iFted by Attorneys William Rlx. A. J.
Treat, Anderson and Ear?, made the fight
*!{rainst Attorneys Goodfellow and J.. H.
Ilnbeson.
Mr. Goortfrilow Tras examined at length
conr^rrAng the complaints in the present
tuit against the trustees, and he pointed
f>;it allegations which he said must have
bÂ«^en made upon Information Senator Earl
had procured while attorney for the trus
tP<>s and imparted to Bishop &. Wheeler
â¢when he joined the firm.
"Do you rlaim to know this of your own
lcn'">tvle^jre?'' queried Mr. Wheeler.
"Of <*Â«urse. I have no positive knowlAdVe
rf what goes on in your ofSee," replied
trie witness*, "but from the data, I con
fend that Mr. Karl was familiar with the
farts of the Varney trust a long time be-
fore the complaint was filed and I infer
from examination of the complaints and
other circumstances that he must have
furnished the* Information."
"Then It is only an Inference upon
which your charges are based?" asked
Attorney Wheeler.
"Inferences which I believe the court
will take from hearing the testimony,"
was the reply.
"The documents," he continued, "which
were turned over by me to Hall and Earl
are now being used adversely to' the trus
tees. My theory is that it makes no dif
ference whether these be public records
or not, and I have authorities which so
state.
"I believe that the Information necessary
to bring this action could not be derived
from the transcript of notes taken before
Judpe Ellsworth which were gi\*en to
Judp* Hall in the Pitcher- Varney suit,
and by him turned over to Senator Earl
when the firm was dissolved.
"What I complain about is that the tes
timony given to them contained all of the
facts relating to the condition of the
trust."
Mr. Wheeler secured from Attorney
GoodfeUow the admission that there were
no antagonistic points between the pres
ent suit and Ihe former suit against Trus
tee Varney over the 123.000.
Mr. Goodfellow under cross-examination
of himself said:
"Concerning the inrjulry about my in
ferences as to the use of documents or
the confidential relations between John
Taylor and H. H. Pitcher I would say
that whenever a client employs an attor
ney and glvÂ«s him documents, whether
public records or not. he calls attention
to the particular facts therein contained.
An attorney who gets information that
way must hold it as the confidential se
cret of hi* client in the meaning of the
Code of Civil Procedure."
"I am not disputing that. I hope," said
Attorney Wheeler. " I will not let that
nasÂ« for a moment. We do not stand
here on any technical ground of defense.
If your Honor find anything that Is not
nice professionally, we will Ftep out, but
the question of- whether this be nice or
not depend? upon our examination here."
Attorney Treat testified that he had
never heard of the Varney estate until
it was brought to his attention by Har
ry Varney, son of John W. Varney, a
beneficiary under Thomas Varney's will.
Some time In 1535 he had commenced work
on the case and had labored on collection
of facts for several years. He had made
copies of many papers on record, and had
done a large part of his work before go-
Ing Into the firm of Bishop & Wheeler.
He had derived much of his Information
about the funds of the Varney estate
from Stephen G. Nye, an attorney for one I
of the heirs-at-law.
Treat said that he had never examined
anjÂ»papers which related to the Pitcher-
Varney litigation, had never secured a
particle of Information from Senator Earl,
and that the complaint had been prepared
by Mr. Wheeler and himself.
Pressed upon cross-examination by Mr.
Goodfellow, Attorney Treat said: "I have
no doubt that at some time or another I
spoke to Senator Earl about the case, and
perhaps told him the facts and my theory
of the matter. I had gone to Mr. Wheeler
with the case because of the abstruse law
points involved."
Senator Earl declared on the ' witness
stand that the Pitcher- Varney suit came
to his former law office while he was at
Sacramento. He had nothing personally
to do with the case before the dissolution
of the firm of Hall & Earl. "The firm of
Bishop & Wheeler never had any interest
In that case." said Earl. "I never-dis
cussed- it with Mr. Wheeler, and never
showed him any of the papers which I
kept In my private desk. The transcript
of testimony referred to here was gtven
to Attorney Garret McEnerney in 18SS, and
I saw nothing of it again until in court
to-day. The documents I received from
Judpe Hall were simply court records, but
whether they were or not. I conveyed no
Information to Mr. Treat or to any mem
ber of the firm of Bishop & Wheeler about
the case. The complaint -drafted
without my knowledge. The Varney trust
suit was In the office before I knew any
thing about it." : â¢â¢â¢â¢
"Did you tell Mr. Wheeler you were
disqualified from taking part In this
case?" queried Mr. Goodfellow. .
"No, sir/
"Do you claim you are entitled to take
part in the trial of this case?"
"I do."
"Do you rnslst on the right to take part
in this trial?"
"In my judgment aa an. attorney I see
no reason not to go into a case which con
tains no antagonistic position to that In
the cause of action in which -I represented
the two trustees. The action here em
braces the accounting demanded from T.
H. B. Varney Jr. for $23,000.
"I am not trying this case and do not
intend to try it. I should- not be In court
now but for the scandalous declarations
made here yesterday by Mr. GoodfeUow."
"Do you Insist," interrupted Mr. Good
fellow, "that you have a right to take
part In the trial of this case on the part
of the plaintiffs?"
"Yes, sir, that Is my Judgment."
"The information I had regarding the
suit of Trustees Pitcher and Taylor, ex
plained Mr. Karl, "was in no way used
to foster or to institute the present liti
gation. The documents which Mr. Good
fellow obtained in open court a3 attor
ney for the three trustees were not priv
ileged or confidential matters. If Mr.
Goodfellow as attorney for the three trus
tees had the right to hand over the testi
mony for use In a trial against one 1 of
those trustees without that one's consent
I cannot conceive how these papers could
be held as confidential." <Â¦
"I should say I would have a right to
examine both Trustees Taylor and Pitch
er in this case or to â¢ use the transcript
of testimony over which this controversy
Is made. It Is a copy of the stenogra
pher's notes which have been filed as a
record of court and' as such are a public
record."
The hearing will be concluded to-mor
row morning. A decision Is expected by
the attorneys during the day.
Students Who Will Take-Part in the Ce!ebratfon.
Mrs.- Smith his â¢ parents at Pacific Grove
cared' for her and are doing so now,- which
does not reflect much credit on the minis
ter. Of course all these "little 'incidents
are recalled since Brother Smith has been
openly charged with wrongdoing and
serve as links to a chain of unfortunate
circumstances, which must result In the
First Church looking around for a new
pastor." .. . , â*; :"-*':.'.*â¢
Smith Is Agitated.
Rev. Mr. Smith was seen by a Call rep
resentative at the home of Craigie Sharp,
one of - the trustees of; the Christian
Church. 718 - Sycamore street. Oakland.
He was very much agitated at the dis
closures concerning him and was at first
vehement in his denunciation of those
who he claimed had been inf>f rumental
in exposing him; With the same old
whine with which he sought to delude the
public when he attacked the good name
of his wife, he asserted that he had con
tinually been the object of persecution,
attack and misrepresentation. In a gen
eral way he Insisted that he Is still the
holiest of the holy and the purest of the
pure, but when pinned down to a definite
statement concerning his antics at Prince
ton, Colusa County, -he slid. from- under
with the assertion that he would neither
deny nor affirm the charges until he goes
before his congregation in his own de
fense.
He feigns to believe that the young
woman in the case did not make the con
fession accredited - her, basing* that belief
upon the assertion that "she is too sensi
ble a girl to confess anything." Â¦
Threats Against the Wife.
Without a blush Smith claims that he
has endeavored to shield his wife through
all the sensational developments of his
domestic difficulties. - but forgetting his
masquerade and allowing the real Smith
to assert himself, he declares that since
the name of his new lady *Â¦ love has been
attacked it may become necessary for
him to make a full statement of Mrs.
Smith's actions. His wife Is not to be
spared now that she becomes a factor
liable to interfere in Â¦ his latest love
affair.
The courts of Alameda County will not
grant Rev. Mr. Smith's prayer for a dlÂ«
vorce as the case now stands. Yesterday
Judge Ogden referred the matter back to
Court Commissioner Babcock. His de
cision is that he will not issue a "decree
on Smith's unsupported statement that
his wife had confessed that she had been
untrue to him."
Earmarks of Conspiracy.
This action following so closely upon
the publication of the Princeton con
fession creates the Impression that the
courts do not take a great deal of stock
In Smith and see In his divorce litigation
the earmarks of a conspiracy. The only
testimony before the court Is Smith's
statement that his wife had made a con
fession to him. He gave the details of the
alleged confession, branding Mrs. Smith
as a social outcast at the very time when
she -was a guest ' at the- home, of his
parents, who are still giving her the
shelter and protection which he denies
her.-
Those "fetters" which so annoyed the
Rev. Mr. Smith are being drawn tighter
and in his desperate straits he Is deluding
himself, but not the public, with the be
lief that some one is jealous of him and
therefore "talking him to death." This
Is what he says on the subject:
"As we all know, there are people in
every section who are willing to talk one
to death, and owing to the Jealous nature
of some in Woodland Rev. Mr. Reagor
has been able to arouse considerable feel
ing against nw and I am satisfied that
he is responsible for the publication of
that article in The Ca11.".. --. ?. .. -
Loving not wisely but too many is what
has happened to Smith.

IN ; unmasking the Rev. â¢ Guy Smith,
pastor of the First Christian Church
of Oakland, and exposing him" in all
the nakedness of his Iniquity and du
plicity, The, Call' has seriously ham
pered the plans of this gay wolf in the
gar* of the sheep.
His Oakland congregation will take im-"
mediate action in the matter and speedy
steps will be taken to rid itself of "his
leadership. Judge Ogden, before whom
his , divorce suit has been pending, has
taken cognizance of the charges made
against the minister and yesterday re
fused to grant him a decree on his unsup
ported statement of his wife's infldellty-
Rev. Mr. Smith himself, like the guilty
driven to a corner, takes refuge behind
the statement that advantage has been
taken of some unfortunate circumstances
to blast his future. He charges Rev. Mr.
Reagor of . Colusa and ' Mr. Browning of
Woodland with being responsible for the
stories about him, claiming they were in
spired by Jealousy.
- Ignored His Father's Warning. \
The parents of the man, as evidence of
disapproval of his treatment of his wife,
are caring for the woman in their home
at Pacific Grove. It is also stated by. a
member of the Oakland church that Rev.
Mr. Smith's father remonstrated with
him for hl3 conduct toward women of
his congregation long before he relin
quished charge of the Woodland parish.
A most decided sensation resulted from
the* exclusive publication in yesterday's
Call of the gay minister's "doings." Oak
land was' shocked at the revelations.
Members of the First Christian Church
were aghast when Rev. Guy Smith was
presented, to them as heis with his mask
of piety and purity pulled aside. There
was a hasty consultation between the,
trustees and the elders and the conclu
sion was reached without delay that dras
tic measures should be taken or the
church would crumble under, the weight
of scandal which its pastor has nut upon
it. Smith will be given a chance to ex
plain his actions to his congregation, but
it is a foregone conclusion that he must
relinquish his pastorate* or the -First.
Christian Church will fall.
Church Will Investigate.
W. T. Gibbs. president of the official
board of the church, said:
"I have always been very careful not to
do any man an injustice, but if the stories
concerning our pastor are true it calls for
a most thorough Investigation. --. .<
"I have written several letters to-day to
parties up the country for information on
which to base a reason for Investigation.
If Mr. Smith has been guilty of the scan
dalous conduct I read about his duty is
readily seen, and if proved he will cer
tainly be requested to tender his resigna
tion/ '..- ' -
The women of the congregation are par
ticularly outspoken In their denunciation
of Smith and demand that he must go.
Must Pay the Penalty.
Mrs. W. T. Glbbs, wife of the senior
elder of the institution, said: '
"Brother Smith will have to go. Ha has
committed a grievous error, to say the
leaEt, and ho must pay the penalty. -While
the story published in The Call was a
great shock to us and deeply regretted hy
every member of the church, we can but
be thankful that the whole affair has been
exposed before it developed into a greater
scandal. , - â¢â¢ â¢
"The treatment Brother Smith accorded
his wife was open to much censure and
a great deal of . comment. His father. I
am told, scolded him for his conduct, es
pecially when his actions at Woodland
were creating gossip.. When hecastoff

PARENTS OPPOSE
SEWING FOR BOYS
ALAMEDA, ' March 21.â The parents of
Alarheda boys are â¢ not In favor :of the
idea^ of their being taught Â¦ sewing in the
public schools. They think that air the
fine embroidery, Hemstitching and drawn
work should â¢ be left , for the girls to | do.
School Director J, R. Sloan stood sponsor
for a- number . of protesting^ parents at a
meeting of the Bpard of Education last
night. I 'Â¦**. â¢ ' : ' ;.j; .j
In the. absence of the necessary, imple
ments with which to establish r manual
training .; in the . schools the principals
sought to ' occupy ! some" of , the time ;of
pupils by introducing sewing. , Pupils, up
to the eighth grade, boys as welt as girls,
receive daily instruction In the gentle art.
Until the school department has a i Buf
flclent appropriation given to it to estab
lish manual | training . the sewing â¢ will Â¦be
taught at least among the primary pupils.
The : protests against boys < being ' taught
sewing ' come , principally . from . parents
whose children attend the higher gram
mar grades.- , â¢ . â¢ -
- "I - don't believe S that -boys -should be
compelled -Â¦ to .do ,Â¦ sewing.'.V said Director
Sloan. "They do not take kindly to that
sort of thing. The work , is too arduous
for their clumsy fingers and I don't won
der at the complaints. -If we cannot have
manual training we ought to purchase a
few tools at a .; small i expense and -start
the boys on something that . will , be . useful
to their future." : ; Â« â¢-â¢ , ; : ; â¢ ? :
As a new course of study is soon to go
into effect which will:make definite pro
vision J regarding ; the , teaching â¢of s sewing
no action was taken ; upon r the Â¦ protests.
In 1 the - meantime the *. boys .will continue
to stitch j and prick holes . in their, fingers.

ROEBER MEETS
HIS MUSTER
ON THE MAT
Olsen, the Danish Wrestler,
Defeats the American
Champion.
Each Obtains One Fall, but the Euro
pean Giant Succeeds in Dig- â¢
abling His Smaller
Adversary.
NETW TORK, March 21.â Beck Oloen of
Copenhagen "met^ Ernest Roeber, the
champion heavy-weight wrestler of Amer
ica, at Madison-square Garden to-night
In a Graeco-Roman match for, the world's
championship, and Olsen was : declared
the Â¦victor by Referee Sara Austin.
This match differed from recent contests
of this order, Inasmuch as It was to all
Intents and purposes "on V the. level."
Roeber ' gained the - first fall In twenty
minutes and twenty-four seconds with a
half-Nelson hold. The ' Dane won the
next, fall, which proved to be the last, by
a front body hold and throw. .Roeber was
unable to come to the center at the call
of time after a ten-minute Intermission
and Olsen , therefore, was given tlie
match. .
-Olsen looked big enough to eat Roeber,
but .was very nervous. Bob Fltzslmmons
was one of Roeber's seconds. Soon after
they shook hands the Dane secured a
wrist hold, which Roeber broke in twenty
seconds. Both then' secured wrist locks,
but neither held on for more than a min
ute. Roeber. finally got a strangle hold,
and with a back lock threw Olsen to the
floor on all fours. Then Roeber tried to
?;et a half-Nelson, but failed,' as -th* big
ellow sprang -to hiÃ feet. After *H>m<j
fiddling Roeber dropped to the mat pur
posely. Olsen secured a three-quarter
Nelson on Roeber, but Ernest broke away
from it by spinning. Roeber then floored
his man and attempted .a half-Nehion,
which was broken after a few seconds
work, and both men struggled to * their
feet. Roeber's arms encircled Olsen's
waist, and the Dane In his efforts to break
this hold appeared to be attempting to
dislocate each of Roeber's thumbs.
Roeber's efforts to maintain his hold
caused the blood to rush to his head and
his eyes to. bulge from their sockets. The
Dane's nose bled profusely because' of his
exertions.
Olsen Forces the Attack.
Shortly afterward Olsen obtained a
half-strangle hold, which was broken, and
Roeber treated a three-quarter Nelson
similarly. The German then took up the
work and got a half-Nelson on the. Dane,
which the latter broke quickly. Then fol
lowed a succession of half-Nelsons gained
by the Dane, but all of them were broken.
Olsen persisted in forcing the attack for
fully live minutes before Roeber got' a
chance to work on the offensive.
With the Dane, on the mat Roeber
winked at his seconds and smiled confi
dently.. His carelessness caused him to
very nearly fall into a strangle hold, out
of which he spun. Roeber's hands became
dyed with blood which flowed from the
Dane's nose and he repeatedly wiped them
on the mat bo that he might get a good
hold. Roeber's efforts to encircle the
Dane's body with both arms proved fruit
less and Oi3en, with seemingly little ef
fort, pulled himself loose. After each
mlxup Olsen presented both arms In a
confident manner, as if inviting attack.
He grappled the German with a two-arm
necklock. which Roeber spun out of.
Immediately afterward followed a sen
sation. Roeber obtained an arm-and
neck hold, which pinned Olsen with right
Bhoulder and ' hip to the floor.- There
seemed to be ; no escape for the big fellow,
as Roeber. still maintaining his hold, re
peatedly Jumped a foot into the air, land
ing each time on the Dane's body and left
shoulder with terrific force. Olsen broke
the hold, only to fall a victim to another,
Roeber- securing a half-Nelson, which
slowly but surely forced the. bigger. man
to succumb, and Roeber. gained the first
fall, in twenty minutes twenty-four sec
onds. .","â¢ - ' - â¢
Roeber left the ring for a rub-down dur
ing a ten-minute intermission, but Olsen
remained in the ring and was attended to.
there by his seconds, â¢ â¢ ,
Roeber Shows His Cleverness.
Opening the second round, the prelimin
ary play was brief. Olsen attempted to
gain a .necklock, - which* Roeber easily
evaded. The Dane's efforts seemed di
rected to throwing Roeber over his shoul
der.' Roeber dropped to the floor and
after a little work Olsen' obtained a full
necklock. which Roeber wriggled out of
immediately, putting Olsen on the defen
sive. Ernest's offensive tactics were of
short duration, as Olsen again obtained a
necklock, . which Roeber broke cleverly.
Directly after this the house went" wild
over Roeber's aggressive work 'as he
chased the big fellow all over the ring in
his efforts to obtain a hold, to the evident
worriment of the Dane. The latter gained
another necklock, which Roeber success
fully broke, and Olsen followed with an
arm-and-neck hold, which; put- Roeber in
jeopardy. . . ; :
The German was being slowly pushed
over, the Dane bearing down on him, but
to the surprise of the Dane's followers
Roeber , wriggled out of the hold. Roeber
was equally successful during the next
minute, making a beautiful head spin in
evading what looked like a certain fall.
Roeber then took up the offensive, mak
ing repeated efforts to get a body hold
on the big man so as to- throw him down
and he was finally successful. He secured
a one-arm hold and tried to get a half-
Nelson .on tho right side. The Dane
worked himself out of the difficulty and
took up the work. This did not last more
than . five seconds as ' Roeber suddenly
Jumped for . his man and endeavored to
obtain a neck hold to throw the Dane
over his head from his shoulder. The
Dane came right bs,ck and after grappling
the German with a front body hold picked
Roeber up and threw him on his back to
the floor with great force. The Dane
then fell on top- of his man with 1 his full
weight, and having the right shoulder
pinned tt became but a question of a few
seconds when ' Roeber should succumb.
The referee tapped Olsen. < on- the back,
signifying that Â¦ the .Dane had gained a
fall. Time 14 minutes 30. seconds. ' .
Â¦ . Defeated Man Badly Injured.
Roeber lay -on his back and had to be
carried in a limp condition to his corner,
where two doctors were summoned 'to at
tend the German, who seemed to be in
jured severely. :
Roeber claimed to have = : sustained a
fractured rib on the right side. The doc
tors who examined him said that he might
be Internally Injured, but that no ribs
were broken. They refused to permit him
to continue .the bout. : Olsen was there
upon declared the ; winner -while Roeber
sat in his corner, crying like a child.
Bob Fitzsimmons then jumped Into the
ring, : . and," while admitting Roeber's de
feat, challenged the Dane â¢on behalf of
the German for another match : for $1000.

Meets This i j
Afternoon.

VWill Not Figure' in the Selection !
of Delegates to the Na
. tional' Convention... . --..".
The members of the executive commit
tee of the Republican State Central Com
mittee will', meet ' to-day at the Palace
Hotel to take preliminary steps for open
ing the convention season. 'Â¦'; ' ;
General talk is to the effect.that:noth
ing* . will be " done ' In the several Congres
sional districts in the way of electing dis
trict delegates to the national convention
at Philadelphia until representatives of
the ; State " Central Committee have - con
sidered the subject. Suggestions may be
made by - the central \ body, which, if ob
served, will render proceedings uniform
and harmonious in the Congressional sub
divisions. . - - .
The duty of selecting- four delegates-at
large and . two from each Congressional
District to â¢ represent California In the
National ' , Republican Convention to as
semble in Philadelphia on j June 19 will be
performed without embarrassment spring
ing from ; the contests : for the honor of
representing Calif ornians in Congress. In
fact delegates to the conventions . which
will be called to nominate candidates for
Congress must be chosen under the pro
visions of Â¦ the primary election law and
therefore according to law cannot.be
elected before next August. Aspirants for
service in Congress are particularly anx
ious to keep out of entangling alliances.
They - regard the - national convention -as
a McKinley ratification meeting and will
applaud the loyalty -and enterprise of Re
publicans who twill ' bear the expense of
attending' the convention. â¢â¢ -
Politicians, s however, talk freely of the
coming fights for Congressional nomina
tion in the First and Fifth districts. It is
understood that John A. Barham, now
representing the First, will not be a can
didate for re-election. State Senator Gil
lette of Humboldt, who ' made a splendid
record in the Legislature, has a strong
following. District Attorney, Webber of
Sonoma is also in the field as a candidate.
Frank L. Coombs is anxious to go to Con
gress, but is .waiting for the people of the
district to arise in their majesty and call
him to ' the front. ' .Thomas Carothers of
Mendoclno has friends and claims.
Present indications point to a stubborn
contest in the Fifth District. Rumors are
circulated that Eugene F. Loud is Elated
for a Â¦ high position in the Postofftce Â¦ De
partment at Washington and will, there
fore, not 'be a candidate for re-election.
These ' rumors, > however,- are not credited
by the supporters of Loud, who assert
that- his -candidacy will be announced in
definite terms at the proper time. Aspir
ants for the honor of representing the dis
trict are legion. Among them are Sheldon
G. Kellogg, Henry C. Dibble, Charles M.
Shortridge. Alfred Bouvler, Frank Mc-
Gowan.vH.- V. .Morehouse, Edward I.
Wolf and Assemblyman >H. W. Brown.
In case none of the foregoing should prove
acceptable there is Â¦an available reserve
list,' embracing W. H. Cobb, Charles Pat
ton and Zenas U. Dodge of San Francisco
and a few statesmen. from San Jose. â¢â¢ Â¦
It is not a sure thing. that Jim Rea and
Johnny Mackenzie will gain possession of
the works in Santa- Clara. County. Al
Bouvler has been surveying the field in
Santa. Clara County and- saying pleasant
words to the leaders of the Good Govern
ment Club.
Collls P. Huntington usually takes' *
hand â¢ in * the fight > for Congress in " tha
Fifth District. He will be in San Fran
cisco next week.- If he frankly announces
a purpose, to give some one'of "the-can
didates active support for the nomina
tion, two "or three of the other aspirants
who- are now counting on his favor or
neutrality will retire from the field. Poli
ticians recognize that Herrin is easy game
in a political battle, but view the situa
tion in a different light when Collls i P.
Huntington enters. the arena. The Re
publicans of 'the Fifth District are. stroi.g 1
enough, however, to smash a Huntingtnn
programme. | The candidates who are now
so eagerly seeking the support of the rail
road chieftain may wish beforethe cam
paign closes that they had appealed to the

ADROIT SCHEME
TO BRYANIZE
PEOPLE'S PARTY
Time and Place for Meet
ing of Populist State
Committee.
Leaders of the Party Suspect That
Bryan's Followers Aim to
Gobble the "Works" at
Los Angeles.
Democrats of the Bryan stripe, togeth
er with some scheming â¢ Populists Â¦ of
Southern California, are putting up a"job
on the People's party of California. -The
first step of the scheme is to. open an
easy way for Bryan and his followers to
grain possession of the Populistic works.
A call has been issued for a meeting
of the Populist State Central Committee
at Los Angeles on April 10. Leading men
of the party fancied at first that It was
a rather Queer proceeding Â¦to summon
nine-tenths of the eommitteeroen to.
Southern California when a central point
might be designated as the place of meet
ing. Later on the. fact came to light that-
Brvan would happen to be .in Los 1 An- '
geles at the time the Populist leaders
were assembled there. At first it was sur
mised that schemers had \, planned (. the.
meeting in Los Angeles in qrder to ex
clude from attendance many committee
men who could not afford the expense of
a long journey. Later on and in the light
of subsequent developments the suspicion
arose that the Democratic managers of
the Bryan campaign were the chief ma-,
nipulators of the meeting- and that' the
real purpose was to absorb the Populis-t
executive committee or merge it into a
Bryan party.
No doubt considerable enthusiasm will
be created when Bryan swings into South
ern California and scatters his platitudes !
over the land. If Bryan does not kick' up
a dust and make a big noise his followers
will force a hullaballoo in hts honor. Even
the calm and ordinarily serene middle of
the road Populist may be turned from the
center of the highway by clouds of dust
ami tumults of shouting. Democratic
politicians in the wake of Bryan, there
fore, count on capturing the Populist or
ganization in the midst of the April tur
moil.
The members of the People's party in
Northern and Central California are ap-
Freher.si\"e of danger. They are faith
ul to the principles of their party and
do not fear defeat as much as they dread
disgrace. Intelligent and sensible men
of the party readily concede that Presi
dent McKinley will be re-elected next
November, but they desire, nevertheless.
to preserve the People's party organiza
tion for use in future campaigns. The
plan of surrendering the works to Bryan
in advance of the contest is not accept
able. In order to defeat the cunning
scheme of the Bryanites members of the
People's party have resolved to select
resolute and fearless representatives 'from
Northern and Central California and arm
them with proxies and send them to Los
Angeles to attend the State committee
meeting on April in.

HUNTINGTON'S COMING
IS CAUSING UNEASINESS
â¢â¢--â¢s-.V. . â¢ *
Southern Pacific Employes Look For
ward With Apprehension to the
Meeting of Directors.
There is an air of .anxiety noticeable in
the big yellow building on Montgomery
Ftxeet as the time for the arrival of
Collls P. Huntington draws near. The
esed president of the Southern Pacific is
now on his way here from the south and
is expected to arrive on Saturday or Sun
day. He is*travellng in his private car,
and with him are Journeying Mrs. Huiit
ington. Miss Campbell, J. C. Smbbs. Ju
lius Kruttschnltt and Secretary Miles.
The regular annual meeting of the board
of directors of the Southern Pacific if hot
for April 6. and the probability of changes
that may then ensue is the reason ot the
uneasiness that- is now felt by the em
ployes who in the past have trained under
the shadow of either the Stanford or
Crocker banner. What will happen to
thorn now that these supports have been
withdrawn is enough of a matter of con
jecture to make them anything but com
fortable.
There will be only fix of the eleven di
rectors at the meeting this year. These
fix are C P. Huntinerton. General Thomas
H. Hubbard. H. E. HunUngton. J. C.
Stubbs, D. O. Mills md Julius rtrutt
frehxiltt. As this is practically z. solid
Huntington beard. It is safe to assume
that as far as Jhe chief executive officers
are concerned the meeting will re-elect
those that are now in office to serve for
the ensuing year. . . â¢- â¢
As eight -of the eleven directors are
rTidrnts of New York or the immediate
vicinity, it is not improbable that the an
nual meetings of the future will be held
in that city instead of here. If that is so
it -will result in making New York the
hfflrtJquarters of the road and will prob
ably cause several changes in the heads
of departments in this city. For instance.
It is not unlikely that the New York di
rectors will insist on putting New York
rmn at the head of the treasury and re
rorrting departments, thereby reducing E
C. Wright and N. T. Smith to the rank of
assistants.
As to what will become of J. A. Fill-
HAD Harry. D. M. Cobb been in the
habit of sleeping in a room with
windows hermetically, sealed or
had his fair young bride been ac
customed to slumbering in a ' chamber
where the air was invited to circulate
freely, they would to-day be living in
happy harmony. Instead of fighting out
their honeymoon differences in a divorce
court.
Of course there were several other trN
fling matters that separated the couple
after six weeks of wedded bliss, but they
do not amount to much. The young ben
edict wanted his shaving mug polished
daily and Mrs. Cobb showed no inclina
tion to do so. Cobb wanted the bird cage
to be treated to a matutinal massage
and this also the bride objected to. The
only thing Mrs. Cobb desired was to wear
her husband's neckties and this the
wretched man forbade her to do.
Mrs. Cobb, since she left the roof that
shelters her spouse, has been making her
home with her mother, Mrs. Egan, at 1609
Golden Gate avenue. Mrs. Cobb's parent
would not allow her daughter to be seen
yesterday and referred all inquirers to
Mrs. Cobb's attorney. Mr. Cobb was to
be seen at the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company's office, but had nothing to say
for publication. "See my attorney," Is all
he would say.
Mrs. Haight, mother of . the deserted
husband, with whom the young couple
spent their honeymoon, was not as reti
cent In regard to the affairs of .the young
couple as they were themselves. She told
the touching tale of their differences with
sorrow and deplored the fact that a sep
aration appeared.t o be inevitable.' .
According to Mrs. Haight, young Cobb
and Josephine Egan were schoolmates,
and Harry used to carry "Joey's" books
to school. "They decided to marry when
they were children," said â¢ Mrs. Haight.
"Their marriage was a grand affair. The
church was crowded and there were four
policemen in front of the sacred edifice to
keep the crowd off."
It afterward developed that the officers
of the law who officiated with such great
success at the nuptial ceremony would
have found plenty to keep them' busy had
they been admitted to the Cobb home dur
ing the'honeymoon.'
"Harry and Joey began to" quarrel right
away," said Mrs. Haight. "Their differ
ences were over trifles. Harry was wroth
because Joey did not polish up the bird
cage and his shaving mug. When I saw
what trouble these little things made,"
continued the tearful mother, "I took
them and polished them up myself. That
evening when my son returned and com
plimented Â»hls wife on the brightness of
the catre and the 'mug, she paid: 'Don't
thanK me; thank your mother, she did it';
and thereupon they quarreled again.
Then "Joey" would wear Harry's neck
ties and soil them for him and she per
sisted in upsetting his bureau drawers.".
"The culminating quarrel 'of the Cobbs
came on the eve of the day that a social
function was. given in their honor by the
young lady who served: as bridesmaid "at
the Cobb-Egan nuptials.
"When they Came '-home from the
party; given -in their honor," said Mrs.
Haight, "they appeared to be happy and
loving. But they had 'not retired ten
minutes when they began to quarrel.
Harry is in the hablt'of sleeping withhls
window wide open and Joey wanted the
window closed. . Every time Harry open
ed " the â¢ window Â¦ his wife would ,. close it.
Finally they compromised by leaving the
window half open and Harry's tying > a
silk handkerchief around Joey's ears." :
In Mrs. Cobb's complaint she alleges
that among the other cruelties she has
had to submit to was her husband stand
ing . guard over her with a shotgun; and
she goes on to pray that her husband be
compelled to return to her $SQO, which, she
says, she loaned him.
"There is absolutely no truth in the
statement that Joey lent Harry $500," his
mother explained. "The $500 she refers to
is. the gift of Harry's father David Cobb
of San Jose. He gave that sum to Harry
to. furnish the home for. his bride. "When
Joey left him and there was no more
any: question- of 'a home Harry . returned
the .: money to , his father. - The shotgun
episode happened this way," Mrs. Haight
continued: "Joey told her husband nho
was going home to her mother. He begged
her to stay with him and try and bee if
they could not begin all over again. Then

LEGALITY Of
BOND ELECTION
HOW IN ISSUE
Capitalist Fritz Files Suit
vto Settle Its. Many Un
certainties.
?Â¦Â¦;-.-
. .
Complaint Sets Forth Six Grounds on
Which the ' Court Is Asked to Is
sue Injunction Against thÂ«
Supervisors.
"With the object of definitely determining
the legality or illegality of the recent bond
election 'suit was filed yesterday by Eu
gene N. Fritz, a well known capitalist, to
enjoin the Board of Supervisors from pro
ceeding to issuo bonds under the
in question for the , acquisition of. lands
in the Mlssioh-for' a public park and for
the so-called "panhandle extension." Mr.
Fritz, who ia represented 'by Attorneys
Arthur Barendt and Charles E. Naylor.
favored the acquisition of the lands in
question, but realizes that the legality of
the issuance Â«*>f the bonds must be" first
determined before capitalists and banks
purchase, the bonds. Hence he has- filed
suit to determine this important question.
The suit attacks the legality, of various
resolutions passed by the Supervisors in
relation to the acquisition of lands for the
purposes named; 'particularly the;resolu
tion passed on January 23, 1599, providing
for the acquisition of .Western Addition
blocks 72. 141. 147, 210, 220, 287, 298, 369, 378,
437. 445, 516 and 525; outside land blocks 84,
169. 194. 271. 296 and 293, and outside land
block "I": the : - resolution ..of 'October ,l6,
1899. providing 1 fortho acquisition' of "Mis
sion blocks' B6 and 87 ! for a: Mission. park,
and the resolutions providing or the spe
cial bond election on December. 27 last.!
â¢ The plaintiff, who holds', the right to sue
by reason of being a : taxpayer,' says all of
the resolutions referred to are hull and
void, and that v bonds. Issued pursuant
thereto will "also be illegal and Void.* for
the reason that no provision :is made In
the proceedings for .. the kind of money in
which the proposed Â¦ bonds are payable:
second, that the three propositions. for the
acquisition of three distinct tracts of land
in** three" widely separated , districts : were
consolidated and voted upon as one propo
sition when they .should . have been .segre
gated; third, that at the time of the elec
tion the city and county government was
working under ' : the '. consolidation : act;
fourth, that the sale will- take place under
the charter. \ which was not Â¦> in force at
the time of the. election: fifth, that; only
29,972 votes were cast at ; the election. ~ a
number Insufficient under .the law making
it .necessary, for such* a". proposition to be
carried by. a- two-thirds vote of the quali
fied electors of the city, the total number
being 70.681; and. : sixth, that the purpose
expressed in the ordinance, designated as
'.'Order No. 231 (Second Series)/; that'of
connecting" Golden : Gate Park with ' the
United States military reservation,* is not
such a purpose as could justify said Board
of Supervisors in declaring or determining
that "public and necessity de
mand" the acquisition of ; land " therefor;
nor. such . a purpose : as ; would Justify the
purchase or acquisition of land by, said
city and : county under the public -parks
act, approved March â¢ 16, 1889. ..
