TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March
B.â Senator Aldrich and the ' New
England Senators who are acting
with ' him in _.ppposlng the ratifica
tion of the "French" treaty are asserting
to-day that they have practically secured
a stay_of proceedings which will prevent
action on the treaty before March 14, the
date upon which the treaty must either
be approved or rejected. As "the subject
Is still pending In secret session. Senators
are prohibited from discussing it. for pub
lication, but enough Is known of the situa
tion to Justify the prediction that the
treaty will not be ratified within the pre
scribed limits, and negotiations have been
cpened with the French Government with
a view to securing an extension of time
in which to obtain ratification.
The opposition- to the treaty has been
able to convince the several Senators that
Its provisions are defective In certain re-
Fpects, and certain modifications are sug
gested which may make it more accept
able.
It is understood the conditions in the
Senate were explained to the President
and Secretary of State to-day, and not
withstanding the urgent request of Â¦ the
President that the treaty In Its present*
shapÂ« should be ratified the opposition
Is stubborn enough to convince him that
the desired results cannot now be ob
tained. ,
Some of the friends of the treaty are
disposed to Insist upon making an open
fight, but the more conservative Senators
who favor ratification realize that with the
limit extending only until March 2t and
the elastic rules of the Senate to aid the
opposition an open fight will avail nothing
for the treaty.
The question now to be determined Is
whether the treaty shall be killed in
secret session by prolonging its con
sideration beyond the time limit, or
whether it Â¦ shall be allowed to go
to the Finance Committee for examlna-;
tlon and report, providing France is will
ing to grant an extension of time.. It Is
freely predicted that unless the treaty is
ratified now the opposition will see to It
that It Is put safely and securely to~Bieep
In the Finance. Committee room and it will
never be heard of again, except- as a^bun
dle of waste paper. .The strongest kind<of
pressure has been brought to bear upon
the proposition without avail, Â¦ and the

FORTIFYING

by Davis.

May Be Incorporated in the

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March S.â
Amendment of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
by the addition cf certain sections from
the convention of free navigation of the
Suez maritime canal would seem to be
likely In defiance of the wishes of Secre
tary Hay. Senator Darts, who will mike
the argument in committee to-morrow fa
vorir.g the adoption of articles from the
Constantinople convention, thinks he has
a strong case. The advocates of amend
ment are not extremists who have been
making the fight for fortifications of the
Nicaragua canal. They are conservative
Senators, who have been defending the
State Department's work, but who appre
ciate force of sentiment for American de
fense in time cf war.
Snez May Be Fortified.
In the Hay-Pauncefote treaty It Is ie
dared in article II that the high contract
lni? part Vs. depirlng- to preserve and main
tain the general principle of neutrality es
tablished In the Clayton-Bulwer conven
tion, adopt as -.h* basis of such neutrali
sation rules substantially as embodied in
the convention between Great Britain and
certain other powers with reference to the
Suez canal. Now it Is pointed out by Da
vis that every article and rule contained
la the treaty signed at Constantinople in
ISSB for the free navigation of the Suez
has been adopted by Secretary Hay and
Lord Pauncefote except those which "grant
to Epypt and the Ottoman power the
right of self-defense In the event of war.
Mr. Davis cannot understand why this
emission should have been made. It is
heM by him that If the Suez canal treaty
w Â»s Felecterj as a model for the Nicaragua
rar.al treaty then its provisions thould
have Y-^en followed exactly. It is under-
F-ood that Secretary Hay holds the condi
tions to b* aUEoeat with respect to the
Ottoman possessions and those existing In
the territory of the proposed Nicaragua,
waterway. Th** Suez canal connects th.Â»
MediterraneAn and Rea seas and Is wholly
en Egyptian soil. The Nicaragua canal
JÂ» to be cut through Nicaragua^ and
C^fta Rlcan territory, which. In the treaty
Â¦with those countries, is not ceded to th<s
United States as American territory, but,
en the contrary, sovereignty Is to be re
tained by them. The members of the For
e'.pn Relations Committee argue that It
the articles omitted have no application
to the Nicaragua canal, as Secretary Hay
contends, there will be no harm In adopt
ing them. They certainly must have some
bearing on the treaty as a whole, or they
would not have been Incorporated. It is
Insisted, despite the opinion from thj
State Department, that article X. which
Is to form the basis of Davis* amendment.
is the most important In the whole treaty.'
It also Is held to have special application
to the Nicaragua canal and to furnish the
United States with exactly the power re
s-Ired "to Insure, by Its own forces, de
fense cf Its other possessions."
Rights of Egypt.
The Bum Canal fil<3 not cost a dollar, yet
!t Is said Egypt, whose rights have now
came Into possession of Great Britain,
may take any measures thought neces
rary to Insure by its own forces the de
fense of Kgyptian territory. Th<? Nlcar
eyuan canaJ. on the other hand. Is to cost
th* people Â©f the United States alone $150,-
OOQ.OOO. In tnts sense, therefore. It must be
considered aa American enterprise, built
under treaty rights from Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, and consequently an Ameri
can possession. The United States Is
charred with th<Â» duty of policing the
canal, of protecting It against destruction
ana of enforcing the provisions of nej
trallty. The American Government must
maintain garrisons at several locks, which
rhall hâ¬ under the American flag. The
right of the Government to take such
zneasnres as It may think necessary in
order to insure by its own forces on land
or sea the defense of the Pacific Coast, in
particular against Invasion by way of the
canal. Is held by the Davis school of
statesmen to be paramount.
Benator Morgan Is against the Davis
amendment. He agrees with Secretary
Hay that the omission of article X Is of
no ep*dal consequence so far aa the eafe
ruardlns of American rights is concerned.
Morgan takes the view that strict neu
tralization of the canal Is all the protec
tion the United States requires for the
Pacific or Atlantic coasts.

TACOMA. March S.â Mrs. Guy Gale. â¢
farmer's wife, aged 25 years, was killed
yesterday at Stones Landing by a man
known here as John Hammond, who ar
rived on Tuesday from Buffalo. N. T.
â¢ lammond had formerly been a suitor for
Mrs. Gale's hand and was rejected. Ha
had sworn that she should not live with
another and carried out his threat.
He went about the deed in such a busi
nesslike manner as to leave no doubt that
he had coolly calculated killing her be
fore he started West. After reaching here
Tuesday afternoon he seemed Impatient
on finding that no steamer Â¦would go to
Stones Landing until yesterday morning.
This steamer he took. It is reported from
there that he proposed that Mrs. Gale
should accept his attentions and go East
with him. She turned a deaf ear to his
story of devotion, only to find that he
was prepared to take her life.
Almost before she was aware of his In
tentions he whipped out a new revolver
and began firing. Three bullets are said
to have entered her brain and body. Sha
died almost instantly. Hammond then de
liberately took hl3 own life, firing a. bullet
into his brain.
A neighbor's child, who heard part of
their discussion, gave the alarm. Mr.
Gale was In Seattle. A messenger was
sent to Inform him. as well as the King
County Coroner. Gal* passed the mes
senger on the road and did not know of
the tragedy until he reached home.
He married Mrs. Gale last year after
the death of her first husband, whom she,
had married in the East In preference to
Hammond. She was a. pretty woman of
the blonde type.
Hammond's body will be buried; at
Stones Landing. Mrs. Gale's will sD a

CHEER FOR

Victoria Given an Ovation on
the Drive From Buck
ingham Palace.
JUBILEE SCENES RIVALED
Vast Crowds Line the Boute and
Greet With Boisterous Ac
claim the Royal
LONDON, March B.â Queen Victoria and
the people of the greatest city in her em
â¢ plre to-day celebrated the victories which
they believe have transformed the cam
paign in South Africa from one of reverse
into one of success. That is the only ex
planation of the unbounded, the unpar
alleled enthusiasm with which hundreds
of thousands hailed their sovereign. In
many ways these demonstrations outdid
those of the diamond Jubilee, although
there were no glittering pageants, no tri
umphal arches, no procession of princes,
but only a dozen life guards followed by
a little old lady in the plainest black cos
tume, who had come for a few days' stay
at Buckingham Palace, as she has done
many a time before. Tet. her hoi* upon
the hearts of her people was probably
never : more strikingly manifested. Un
like that of the diamond jubilee, to-day's
popular outburst was almost Impromptu.
The fierce pride In the strength of a
mighty empire that pervaded London ex
ultation when the Queen last drove
through the streets in 1597 had vanished,
and in its place there were thankfulness
and rejoicing for the victories which had
succeeded months of gloom. The depth of
feeling which this demonstration repre
sented could only be gauged by those who
mingled with the crowd. Mothers In deep
mourning for sons killed on the far-off,
veldt struggled bravely with the most
hilarious to catch a glimpse of the Queen
whose womanly sympathy and thought
fulness for the soldiers had topched their
hearts. Often the long cold vigils were
rendered futile by tears that dimmed the
eyes and blurred the vision as the royal
carriage passed. As one very old woman
said: "I've seen her many a time, but she
said she was sorry for my boy and 1
must see her again before I die."
Thousands Wait Patiently.
Thousands braved" the raw east wind
and stood for hours waiting patiently who
have often seen the Queen and who. In
ordinary circumstances, would scarcely
budge to watch her pass. Among those
were many personal friends of the sover
eignâfor Instance, the Countess of Brown
low., a great' friend of Victoria and a fa
vorite at court, who sat on the curb shiv
ering ' for hours Â¦ with .the crowd outside
Buckingham Palace. In short. It was not
so much a desire to see the monarch as
it was an overwhelming need of an out
let for jubilation over the war and a nat
ural inclination to let the Queen see and
share the gladnes3 of her people, that
prompted London spontaneously to make
to-day one of the most memorable cele
brations of Victoria's reign.
It was quite different from the mad re
joicings that marked the relief of Lady
smith. Rowdyism was conspicuously ab
sent, although the crowds reached such
proportions that the number -of police
would have been quite inadequate had the
people been obstreperous. Moreover, in
termingled with the rejoicings of patriot
ism there was a particularly keen appre
ciation of the Queen's personality, her
womanliness, her great age. This little
touch of reverence for sex rather than for
sovereign rendered the huge crowds tract
able in the hands of the good-natured po
lice, and It was not a hard task to Induce
them to surge back and to make way for
the royal carriage. When the Queen of
Great Britain and Ireland and Empress of
India did pass, nodding as if to many
friends, intsead of bowing with royal re
straint, there echoed under the roar of
cheers many heartfelt expressions, such
as *'God bless her." "God keep - her."
"She's a brave woman." and scores more
like them.
It was small wonder that now and again
tears of Joy rolled down the cheeks of the
aged sovereign.
The semi-official duties undertaken by
the Queen during the day would have
tried the resources of many a woman un
der 81 years of age. Starting early from
Windsor by train she reached the metrop
olis shortly after noon. Until she reached
Buckingham Palace there was never a
moment of quiet. Cheers spread .along
her' route like prairie flre.' Previous to
her arrival Lord Roberts, General Buller
and other heroes of the war had monopo
lized the lung power of the waiting crowd,
and such crowds were never seen In Lon
don even on Jubilee day. Whenever a
soldier or a sailor appeared he was al
most mobbed, so anxious were the people
to show their patriotism. The staid equip
ages of nobles that never before were
guilty of 'displaying anything more start
ling than a crest, were gay with colored
streamers. Every house along the route
to the palace made some attempt at decor,
ation.
"When the hoarse volley announced the
royal approach children and women were
hoisted on'the shoulders of men. The art
students at Kensington, male and female,
as on Ladysmith'day, were again to the
fore, bareheaded and singing patriotic
songs, while throughout the day medical
students in large bodies led the cheering
and singing.
"Unprecedented Scene.
The scene In the quadrangle of the pal
ace after the Queen's arrival, when Lords
and Commoners joined" In singing the na
tional anthem* was unprecedented and
will probably never be repeated during
the present reign. Viscount Cross and Mr.
Chamberlain acted as spokesmen, and
graciously greeted the royal visitor, but
It was to Lady Buller ; that the Queen
quickly turned with a grateful smile.
Then, in the presence. of the legislators of
the United Kingdom, drawing the wife of
the reliever of Ladysmlth closer to her.
she.whlspered. words of. thanks. After
scarcely three hours of rest her Majesty
made a tour of the. city proper, amid the
greatest enthusiasm.
\lt is impossible to estimate the extent
of the crowds through which she passed
before returning ; to Buckingham Palace,
but the numbers were well up in the hun
dreds of thousands. After it was all over
and while a cheering crowd of 10,000 people
still hung outside the , palace, the Queen
dined 'with - the ;Â¦ Prince and Princess of
Wales. : the Duke and ; Duchess ; of York
and the other members of the royal fam
ily.-The Prince of "Wales had been absent
during the day, owing to the sale of the
late Duke "of race horses
at Klngsclere.ibut the Princes had come
in for a~ large share of the ovations.

In November, 1862. he was elected a
member of Congress, his term commenc

until . December 5, 1863, when he entered
Congress still holding the commission,
but. as a matter of fact, he had filed his
resignation . with the Secretary of War
and President Lincoln, with the distinct
understanding that he might at any time

of Congress, still holding a commission

said that such were the facts, and that
a similar plan was- made- with General

that Representative Bailey was the leader

PRESCOTT, Arix., March B.â Parties
who arrived in Prescott to-day from the
Tonto basin country state that another
war Is threatened there similar to that of
1887 and ISBB. when forty people were
killed in what waa: known as the Tewks
bury-Graham feud.
While not over half a dozen men of
those engaged In the former feud are alive
to-day, the causes which brought It about
still exist, and new men seem willing to
fight on the same old lines.
The trouble Is between the cattlemen
and the sheepmen. Large herds of sheep
from Northern Arizona are driven south
for the winter, returning to their, northern
grazing grounds again in the spring, and
one of the favorite routes Is vla^Tonto
basin, which Is usually well watered and
abounds In good grass. The drouth of
the past year has caused a shortage of
both water and grass, and the cattlemen
have served notice on the sheepmen that
on account of these conditions nicy would
not be permitted to return north by this
route this spring. The latter sent back
word that they were going through Tonto
basin If they had to fight their way.
The advance guard of the returning
flocks was met by the cattlemen ami
turned back and scattered. Several cases
of arms and ammunition are known to
have been shipped into that section re
cently. Open threats have also been made
by the interested parties to shoot each
other on sight.

quired by Captain J. R. Delamar. Tho

Mr. Dflamar. Work will be commerced
â¢within ten days. The Bully Hill mire is

miles northrapt of Redding. It wa3 re
rfruly purchased by Delamar from James
Eallee for J2T.0.000.
It had been believed that a Smelter
Â¦would be etecteJ at the property, but th^
thoupht of a refinery had not entered th*
public mir.d. The refinery will be the/u;ly
one In California. It will provide fo" the
turning out of cepper bullion. The product
of the Keswlck smelter, known as matte.
is shipped across the continent to New
Jersey to be refined. Mr. Cohen says his
company enpares In no other business
than mining. It dors not conduct board
irp-houses. stores or other establishment,
leaving those pursuits to the residents j!
the county.
The company will erect schoolhouses
for the benefit of the families of em

EXPLAINS THE
POSITION OF
THE PRESIDENT
Statement Given Out With
Reference to the Porto
Rican Bill.
Dogma That the Constitution Carries
With It Free Trade to the Isl
ands Controverted by Re
publican Tenets.
WASHINGTON. March B.â A member
of the Cabinet to-night pave out an au
thoritative statement. In which It is said:
There has been a wide misapprehension of the
P<rto Rican tariff bill, of the attitude of the
President, of the action of Congress and of
their relatior.s~Ho each other. The criticism
which has come from some quarters is due
almotii entirely to a misunderstanding of the
real facts. The attempt to represent that there
has l.een a disagreement between the President
and Congress is wholly unfounded. The Presi
dent In hit annual message of December 4
urged that the customs duties on trade between
Porto Rico and the United States be removed.
Porto Rlro. severed from Ppnin. had lost her
old markets and had palnM none In their
places Humanity dictated every effort to lift
her up and to give her a new market. f This
was the President's plan, and what need of
such a plea if the constitution of itself carried
free trade to Porto Rico? In that case free,
trade goes u> her. whether or not. Had the
President's suggestion been adopted all would
have been well. But when the time came for
action In Congress two tendencies were seen.
On the one hand there were good men and
some business and agricultural interests that,
while not objecting, or little objecting, to free
trade with Porto Rico alone, feared that free
trade with Porto Rico would be made a prece
dent for free trade with the Philippines. They
felt there should be a distinct assertion and
exercise of the power to Impose duties, how
ever small, as an assurance that this power
was reserved for other cases.
Scheme of Politicians.
On the other hand, what the President pro
posed as a worthy act of national generosity
and liberal policy was seized by political oppo
nents and claimed as a necessary and Inevitable
measure of inherent constitutional right. They
Insisted that the constitution, by its own force,
extends to Porto Rico and all .the new island
possessions and spreads all its provisions over
them, including uniform taxation. They sought
to hind the Republican party to this policy.
It was a cunnlns game, but if did not *uc
c**"d. The apprehension of the honest obiectorn
who feared that the concession of full free
trade with "Porto Rico would lead to mistakes
and the designs of the exaftv partisans who
meant that It should, were both met and frus
trated by the bill which paused the House and
which levied 13 per cent, or less . than one
sixth of the- Dlngley rates. : â¢ ..â¢....Â¦ -Â¦â¢â¢ Â¦
There was another point which was not gen
erally understood. The bill provides that the
whole amount of duties on goods coming from
Porto Rice shall be paid hack to Porto Rico
for the benefit of the island. Thus It fully
harmonizes with the object at which the.
President aimed and absolutÂ»ly no ground Is
left for nny pretense that the policy of the
President and Con*rreÂ«s was In the slightest
degree harsh and oppressive. â¢
But One Real Issue.
Nc one can understandlnrly object to the 15
per cent duty, all paid back to Porto Rico,
on the rround that It Is unfair and hard
toward Porto Rico. He can understandlncrly
object on the claim that there Is no power to
levy any duty at all and such a claim would
loave the President and Congress powerless
and helpless in the Philippines as well as In
Between a 15 per cent duty as provided by
the Congressional bill, every cent of which is
to be return*^! to Porto Rico, and the removal
rf customs duties as suggested by the Presi
dent for humanity's sake, there Is absolutely
no difference whatever In practical results'.
Hut between a 15 per cent duty and free trade
ns a constitutional right going necessarily and
instantly wherever new land may be acquired,
there Is t*iiÂ» worldwide difference between I re
serving full dlscretlonarv power to deal with
new possessions as their varying interests
nnd ours may require nnd leaving no discre
tionary power In Congress whatever. And thtÂ«
Is the real Issue which hnn bÂ»en forced. by the
attitude of the mlnorltv in Congress.
As for the welfare: r>f the new peoples who
have come under our flair we should leave our
selves free to deal with each case as Its own
merits demand. The claim which leslsts that
free trade iroes Â»>v legal right to Porto Rico
wrwld liln.l us hand And foot.
The partisans who sought to put the Presi
dent and Congress In a hole will find that they
have take a position which would estop them
from carrying out the policy they have pro
posed for the disposition .of the Philippines.
It Is enough for the present to Â«iy that our
contention that the constitution does not by
Its own force extend over the new posjesslona
without legislative action Is in harmony with
the general tenor of judicial decision and legis
lative action from the acquisition of Louisiana.
dÂ«n to this time.
The Republican party had Its birth In an
lesue very like that which h.now presented.
The Palhoun doctrine van that the constitu
tion V>y Its own force carried slavery Into the
territories of the United States. The Repub
lican party sprang- Into tx-lng from the upris
ing of the public conscience against this doc
trine.
The political helm of thnsÂ« who put forward
the dnrma that the constitution of Its own
forr* carried slavery Into the territories of the
I'nltr'rt Plate* now maintain the dogma that
the constitution of Its own force can-leu free
trad" oven Into the new island territory of
the United States without legislative Action.
It is an Interesting circumstance that In this
new epoch of our history the Republican party
1Â« again battling for a principle kindred to
that which Rave tt birth. .

WOODLAND.' March B.â The poolroom
agitation at Washington is likely' to result
In some sensational developments.
Supervisor T. C. Snider appeared before
Judge Rug-gles this afternoon, and swore
to a complaint against R. H. Buckingham
of Washington, charging that on or about
the sth of March. 1900, the said Bucking
ham willfully, maliciously and unlawfully
committed the. crime of criminal llbei, as
follows, to. wit: , y '
The said._ R. ,H. .Buckingham did. then
arid there, at a public gathering of many
people, utter, publish and cause to be pub
lished, and did declare and publish of nnd
concerning one T. C. Snider the following
false, malicious, defamatory and unlawful
words: "I am not sure that Snider signe-1
the petition, but I am convinced that that
official has signed some document tl::Â« t
was presented to him by Ed Krlpp and the
latter's lieutenant. Duffy; that a man as
crooked as Snider Is would vote for and
sign almost anything." Â¦ â¢ - -
The complaint further alleges that the
paid T. C. Snider was at the time of thÂ«
utterance 'and publication' of the â¢ said
Buckingham, aforesaid, a member of the
Board of Supervisors of Yolo County; ami
the said Buckingham, there and then, re
ferred to certain petitions that were then
being circulated In the town of Washing
ton for and against the licensing of pool
selling in Yolo County: and the said Buck
ingham, there and then, by said utter
ances above set out did charge, and did in
tend to charge, the said Snider with being
dishonest and corrupt, and that he would
corruptly vote on said petition If. the same
were ever presented to the Board of Su
pervisors of salo. Yolo County: and the
said Buckingham, then and there, well
knew the said utterances to be malicious
and false.
Judge Ruggles promptly Issued a war
rant of arrest ard put It in the hands of
the Sheriff.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC TICKET
INDIANAPOLIS, March B.â The Social Democratic National Convention held a
stormy session this afternoon and this evening: At. the morning: session tho
committee from the Social Labor party and the sub-committee from the con

mittees locked horns on a name for the united party. The name Social Demo
crat was finally chosen. : '
Then came the question of a ticket. E.:V. Debs waÃ placed in nomination, but
he arose and said that under no circumstances would he be a candidate.' Ho said
that he had private reasons for declining. Mr. Stedman of Illinois named Fred O.
McCarthy of Massachusetts for President, and Representative Carey of Massachu

Cleveland for Vice President. â¢ Mr. Harriman declined,' and in the confusion that
followed the convention was adjourned. â¢ â¢ ,

deliverance of the olden time is the same
God now."
The speech of the venerable President
brought tears to the eyes of men and
women alike. The Free State's Volkluad
(national anthem) was then sung. The
visit of President Kruger has done much
good and has cheered the despondents.
President Kruger more recently has been
visiting the commandos south of Bloem
fontein.
Fighting is proceeding at Mafeking. All
the outside forts except one have been
taken by the.Boere.
Much satisfaction is expressed at the
courtesies extended to General Cronje by
the British.
Secretary of State Reltz has Issued war
bulletins, in which, after saying the Gov
ernment has no official tidings of the sur
render of General Cronje, but must accept
it as a fact, however painful, he adds:
"The Government' remains assured that
the surrender will not discourage the
burghers in their defense of their inde
pendence and standing as a nation. The
struggle thus far has shown that the re
publics have vindicated themselves as an
independent people. This reverse will not
stagger us. In the struggle for our cher
ished rights our belief remains that what
even happens, the Lord still reigns.'
"Owing to the invasion of the Free State
by a large force of the enemy and other
circumstances, it becomes necessary to
take up other positions; hence the-burgh
ers in Natal have retired to Blggersberg.
All the commandos' have reached there
safely, except a few who retired In the
direction of Van Reenans Pass. Thus
Ladysmith and Kimberley are no more
besieged. In retiring the enemy was time
after time driven back, so that our
laagers were not cut off. In these fights
a few men were killed or wounded and
enemy lost heavily. ,
"In spite of all reports, the spirit of the
Bethulie, so that at any moment we may
hear of his reaching the latter place or
the bridge over Orange River, just south
of it. This bridge has certainly been de
stroyed and will have to be replaced.
The fate of Mafeking seems trembling
in the balance. Those who hope for the
best must be beginning to lose heart now.
If the Boers Insist on continuing the siege
the place will probably fall before it can
be relieved. If Mafeklng falls, the Boers
will get a prize that will please them, for
among Baden-Powell's officers are Lord
Cecil, son of the Prime Minister, and Lord
Charles Cavendish-Bentinck, brother of
the Duke of Portland and a great-grand
son of King William IV.

Transvaal From t.e Hand
of the Oppressor.
PRETORIA. March B.â A- special dis
patch from Bloemfontein says that Presi
dent Kruger, addressing a crowd of peo
ple, said: . .
"Although God is testing our people, my
personal opinion is that the limit of the
test is nearly reached. If the peopie are
sustained by faith in the time of adver
sity God will soon again turn the tide in
our favor. If we have strong faith in
God he will surely deliver us. The God of
LONDON. March 9.-Lord Roberts'
turning movement yesterday effect
ually dislodged the Boers from their
position, but they eucceeded in mak
ing good their escape. They were
not surrounded. They took alarm too
soon for the British cavalry, which, ex
hausted by the wide sweep necessary to
turn the Boer works, could not cut them
off or bring them to action. They are said
to be gathering at Abrahams Kraal,
Â¦.bout thirty miles from Poplar Grove and
c.bout the same distance from Bloemfon
fcefn.
With the great number of men, horses
and oxen that move with headquarters,
Â¦Â»ater In large quantities Is a necessity.
.Therefore, Roberts' advance is likely to be
either by Modder River or Kaal Spruit.
From General Buller no news has been
received, but we hear Indirectly of some
x>t his doings and of those of the com
mandos opposed to him through bulletins
Issued at Pretoria on Monday. The relief
of Ladysmlth Is alluded to airily as "other
circumstances which obliged the BoÂ«r
army to take up different positions." The
bulk of their commandos are reported to
have retired to Biggersford Range, where
In epite of Sir Redvers' report as to the
practical clearance of Natal, they prob
ably still are, while 'a few retired in the
direction of Van Reenans Pass.
If Boer reports can be accepted, Big
f;ersberg will be strongly held for a time,
while Van Reenans Pass has been practi
cally abandoned. The movement of Butl
er's troops, as far aÂ» can be learned from
British sources, supports this view.
As expected. General Gatacre has ex
perienced no opposition and ha? been able
to occupy Burghersdorp Junction, where
the railway line into the Free State by
â¢ray of Bethulie and Springf ontein meets
the Aliwal North branch. There are no

SAD PLIGHT OF
THE GARRISON
OF MAFEKING
Typhoid Malaria Has Broke
Out in he Women's
Laager. ;.
MAFEKING, Feb. W.â What may. be
typhoid malaria has broken out in the
women's laager, and dysentery, due to the
absence of vegetables, 'is rife among the
garrison. We are thrown, upon our own
resources. Such luxuries as we had are
exhausted or have been commandeered
for the hospitals, which are fllled to
overflowing. The children's graveyard,
close to the women's laager, grows week
ly as the young llvea are cut short pre
maturely by shell and fever. We look
with hope deferred for relief.
The cheerfulness which was character
istic of the early days of the siege has
almost deserted us, the men preferring to
remain at their posts rather, than move
about and v,-ork up an appetite which
cannot be sat'sfied. The natives are in
the worst plight. Those who are unable
to obtain work arÂ» allowed a small hand
ful of meal dally. Many; braving the dan
ger, wander about the town with gaunt
and hungry facs In search of work,
which entitles them to an extra ration of
meal. If they find work I they are gener
ally too weak to perform it. â¢ : . â¢'
From their advanced posts the Boers
rake the streets and market square. ' It is
impossible to dodge their bullets. We
have taken remnrknble precaution, how
ever, and the casualties, though heavy,
are not what they might have been had
les3 able men been at the head of affairs.
Even the headquarters mess fares scant
ily. Like saints under the altar we cry,
"How long, O Lord, how lonpr?"
Two hundred and ninety-two persons
have been killed, wounded or died of dis
ease. The jrarrlson is so small that it
would be criminal to make its weakness
public, but there Is never so much as a
whisper. If any one sueÃested the possi
bility of surrender it is because we do not
mean to get beaten, and we are cheerfully
enduring the hardships of to-day rather
than* to make surrender in any
possible to-morrow.

NORVALS PONT
NOW OCCUPIED
BY CLEMENTS
Lord Roberts Repor's the Cap
ture of a Krupp Gun, Tents i
and Wagons
LONDON. March B.â Lord Roberts tele
graphs he has captured a Krupp gun and
a number of tents and' wagons. He also
announces that General Clements has oc
cupied Norvals. Pont. The following is the
text of Lord .Roberts' dispatch:
"POPLAR GROVE. March B.â Two bri
pades of cavalry, with horse artillery anl
Kelly-Kenny's division, marched to-day
ten miles eastward.
"The Boers were quite taken by surprise
yesterday. They moved oft* so hurriedly
that they left cooked dinners behind. ,Wo
captured a Krupp gun and several tfnts
and wagons. The total casualties were:
"Killedâ Lieutenants Keswick and Frlos
llck. .
"Woundedâ Lieutenants Bailey of . the
Twelfth Lancers and De Crlspigney of th<?
Second Life Guards, both severely, and
Lieutenant Smith of the Shropshlres, wlÂ«o
is believed to have been picked up by a
Boer ambulance. Two men , were killed;
forty-six were wounded and one man \a
missing.
"Gatacre reports he Intends occupying
Burghersdorp to-day. Repairs to the rail
roads toward both Stormberg and Leyna
berg are being pushed. Clements now oc
cupies Norvals Pont, on the south bank of
the Orange River. The bridge was blown
up March 6 and the enemy is holding the
north bank of the river, but not, it is be
lieved, in, any great strength."
The fufl extent of Roberts' success yes
terday is not clear, but the best Informed
appear satisfied that it brings peace per
ceptibly nearer. The experts expect that
the burghers will make no further itand
west of the Free State capital, and some
of them even deduce from the fact that
the Boer forces are divided and have re
treated in different directions that demor
alization has set in, and the Transvaal
forces will next be found carefully in
trenched in positions north of the Vaal
River, where the bulk of the Free
Stater* will abandon the contest and sue
for peace. Elsewhere the news indicates
that the conditions continue hopeful from
a British point of < view, the telegrams
from Mafeking alone showing any de
spondence. : Â¦â¢_'Â¦Â¦ Â¦% '.Il;.7Â«>>JY:. 1 l;.7Â«>>JY :

against a high mountain occupied by the
Transvaal' troops, who were now fleeing-,
in consequence of the flight of the, Free
Staters, south of the river. It is impos
sible at present to give the Boer numbers,
but.lt is estimated that they reach 14,000,
all of whom are now in flight.
In the course of the operations the
Ninth Lancers attempted to get close to
the Boers' right, with the object of charg
ing, but the Boers came out in great force
and the Lancers were compelled to' re
tire. A battery was then sent forward
to hold the enemy in check while the Gra
hamstown Volunteers and a company of
mounted infantry supported by another
battery engaged the Boers on their right
flank. The Boers fired shells, falling short,
however, and they made a stubborn de
fense of the kopje on our right,' enfilading
the battery: and killing, eighteen- of thÂ«
battery horses. The mounted infantry
gradually repelled the Boers and the bat
tery then took a position and expelled
them from their laager in confusion.
The Boers held a strong position on the
north bank of the river, but the flight
from the southern bank compelled them to
retreat. They showed great adroitness in
getting away the wagons and displayed
a bold front while the rest of the force
was busy in-spanning.
General French's division consisted of
three brigades of cavalry, two of mountea
infantry and seven horse batteries.

of America. He would then deserve the
thanks of the Christian world.' " ;

Questioning the merit of the decisions ar
Fincke had a lead throughout the greater
part of the bout, and Dukelow only saved
himself from a complete knockout by
hugging his hard-hitting opponent about
the waist. Fincke was the stronger and
showed considerable cleverness. His fa
vorite move was a side step and then a
quick cross with the right for the bead.
He scored with this repeatedly. He land

round, and Dukelow staggered aimlessly

Dukelow sent out signals of distress

about the legs. The latter was landing as
he pleased, but the Easterner was game
and took a lot of punishment. The fight

Dukelow scored first with a left on the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March B.â Cries of help from
Mrs. George Bruch brought the guests of
the Russ House to her aid this morning:,
and according to her story prevented the
murder of herself and son by her hus
band. A year ago Mrs. Bruch was the
widow of Joseph Kohlbecker, and was left
with sufficient money and property to care
for herself and child for the rest of her
days. â¢
George Bruch had been employed about
their place, the Seven-mile House, near
Lob Gatos, and in a few months he had
wooed and won the widow. Then he be
came indolent and lazy and would do no
work about the place. He constantly de
manded money of her to spend in dissi
pation. Mrs. Bruch refused to stand this
and sold her property, and with her son
made a trip to Switzerland, leaving her
husband to shift for himself.
On Monday ' Mrs. Bruch returned and
she and her Bon engaged apartments at
the Russ House in this city. Bruch heard
of his wife's return and yesterday called
at the Russ House to see her. She refused
to open the door of her room. He asked
her if she intended to live with him, but
she declined to further support him
This morning Bruch returned and was
admitted to the room. He took off his
coat, grabbed Mrs. Bruch and placed a
loaded revolver to her cheek, saying he
intended to kill her and then her 18-year
old son. The woman screamed, and this
brought the guests of the hotel to her aid
The police were summoned and Bruch was
locked up. This afternoon Mrs. Bruch
charged him with assault to murder be

idly, but the bout ended before Dukelow
could regain much of his lost ground. The
winner was cheered as he left the arena.
W. J. Rodenbach, another of the East
ern contingent, made his debut and made
as favorable an impression as that made
by Scholes. He met George Tantau, who
is apparently a better bicycle racing man
than boxer. Rodenbach scored the only
clean knockout of the tournament. He
outclassed Tantau aa a boxer and admin
istered as little punishment a 6 he could
consistently, letting many openings go by.
Tantau was trying all the time, and, land
ed one blow on the head which made
Rodenbach blink his eyes. In the sec
ond round he went in to end matters,
knocking Tantau down several times. A
right on the stomach caused Tantau to
drop his hands, and then a right and left
on the head caused him to sink quietly
to the floor. He was dazed for some time.
John Scholes drew against Robert Law
rence, unattached, and gained the deci
sion in one and a half rounds. Lawrence
was not knocked out, but he stayed down
on hia knees until the tenth second was
counted, and thus lost. He was aggres
sive in the first round and tried rougnlng
it with Scholes. The latter quietly cau
tioned him, and when he persisted went
at him and quickly took all the fight oujt
of him. Lawrence went down frequently
to avoid punishment.
The attendance was unusually large and
the sport the best ever seen here among
amateurs. The poorest boxers were, with
few exceptions, weeded out on the first
night, leaving in the clever ones.
Daniel Danziger, Olympic Club, made
quick work of William Schoenbein, unat.
tached. In the first bout of the night. He
went at his opponent from the Bound of
the pong and soon had him in difficulty.
His blows were clean and he landed them
at will. Schoenbein went down several
times and finally stayed down ten seconds
and was declared the loser.
The second bout was the sensational one
of the evening. It was between Frank
McConnell Jr. of the Olympic Club and
N. T. Gilfeather of the South End Rowing
Club. The Judges named McConnell the
winner after three remarkable rounds.
Mingled cheers and hisses greeted the de
cision. Kach youngster scored so often
and so effectively that only the judges
keeping their scores could decide which
was entitled to the decision. McCon.ell
was the first to lead and started to mix
things at a lively rate. His favorite blow
was a left swing, which invariably landed
on head or body. Gilfeather was busy
all the time. The second round was a
whirlwind affair, both lads standing
gamely to their guns. The spectators
were in an ecstasy of delight at the bril
liant showing, their applause being con
tinued throughout the interval of rest.
Both tired In the last round, but did their
best to put each other out, standing up
and giving blow for blow.
Britt and Gooby started a trifle slowly,
but soon woke up and had a merry time.
Britt was much the cleverer and won on
points. Just as the bout ended he floored
Gooby with a hard right.
J. Doyle won from J. J. Groom, a tall
youth from the Academic Athletic
League. Neither could hit much.' Doyle
appeared later In the middle-weight class
against F. C. Wegener. Neither boxed
fast enough to brush flies off each other,
both acting as if half asleep. Doyle re
ceived a blow on the head early In the
second round and, waving his arms In
a graceful Delsarte movement, fell to the
floor. He seemed completely out, but as
the referee counted off the last of the
fateful ten seconds he jumped to his feet
and ran blithely to his corner.
The spectators did not agree with the
judges' decision In the Pallas-Berger bout.
Pallas Is muscled like Sharkey, while his
opponent was a thin youngster with a
quaint humor. He poked fun at Pallas
for his wild rushes, the while Berger
Jabbed him in the face. Pallas sought
the assistance of Referee Kitchen, saying
Berger was fouling him. The Judges final
ly gave it to Berger on points.
There will be both boxing and wrest
ling on the card to-night.

The Park Commissioners met last even-
Ing and considered the question concern-
Ing the admission of automobiles Into
Golden Gate Park. Commissioner A. B.
Spreckels put himself on record as op
posed to admitting them, saying that they
would frighten horses, endanger children
and were generally a source of danger

matter had. , been talked . over It
was voted Â¦ by all the Commissioners

WARM DEBATE
ON THE PORTO
RICAN BILL
Various Senators .Engage
in Colloquy and Ar
gument.
Pettus Speaks of the President*
Changed Views and Foraker Dis
cusses Possibility of For
eign Complications.
WASHINGTON. March B.â Formal dis
cussion of the Porto Rlcan tariff and civil,
government bill began In the Senate to
day and continued uninterruptedly for
four and a half hours. The principal
speakers were Foraker. in charge of tha
measure, and Pettus, but at various times
during the debate lively colloquys oc
curred. In which other Senators were par
ticipants.
After Mason ef Illinois had entered hi*
motion to discharge the Committee on
Foreign Relations from further considera
tion of a resolution expressing sympathy
for the Boers, end it had gone over until
to-morrow under the rule. Pettus deliv
ered a carefully prepared speech In oppo
sition to the penolng bill. Said he:
Defends the President.
No sordid politician's fingers had bean put
Into the Ink of that message. The President
waa honest and sincere when he distinctly ad
vised free trade between the United Statea and
the Island of Porto Rico.
The public press is now trying to make uÂ»
believe thÂ» Secretary of War Is the author of
the pending bill and that the President has
acceded to the provisions of the measure. For
one I refuse to believe this charge against tha
President. Though he may desire re-election,
he was a brave soldier and Is an able anil
generous man. For him It Is not everything In,
life to be re-elected to the Presidency by his
party. He has acted for the common good of
all the people. If he approves your bill then
I may believe any vile story against any good
man.
Pettus called attention to the amend
ment proposed by Davis, which, he said,
was a most Interesting specimen of the
product of Inventive gtjnius. He said: ;
The Senator proposes to send over to ths Porto
Ricans the constitution In Installments â a lit
tle now and a, little then.
Foraker, In charge of the pending bill,
replied to Pettus. Adverting to the criti
cism aroused by the bill, both In tho
newspapers and among the people, For
aker said that so far as he had been in
formed no Intelligent and appreclatlva
man In Porto Rico had dissented from thw
propositions of the measure. There may
have been some criticism on the part of
the Porto Ricans. but generally it waJ
accepted as an excellent bill. Lindsay In
quired if Governor General Davis himself
had not recommended free trade with Por
to Rico. Foraker replied:
Yes he did make such a recommendation, but
the committee, after full consideration, de
cided against his proposition. We are thÂ«
Legislature for the whole Ignited States and
we were forced to consider the question from
all points of view. The tariff provision waÂ»
conceived in mercy to the Porto Ricans. and
in Its generosity It 13 without precedent In thÂ«
Territorial legislation of the United Statea. .
Foreign Complications.
Foraker discussed the probability that
this Government would be asked by other
powers for an open door in the Philip
pines, and declared that It was an Im
portant and perhaps imminent contin
gency, of which account would have to
be taken. We wanted trade in the Orient,
and after we demanded an entrance Into
China we must grant one In the Philip
pines. He thought the Philippines could
not to be dealt with as It was proposed t.>
deal with Porto Rico.
Mr. Tlllman â Then the contention Is that wa>
can take Porto Rico under our wing and pro
tect her to the utmost, but that we cannot do
the same thine; for the Philippines.
Continuing, he asked why the President
had originally recommended free trade
with Porto Rico and the House ha.i
brought In a bill to that end. only chang
ing the course of Its policy after hearing
from Mr. Qxnard. the sugar king. Reply-
Ing. Foraker referred Tlllman to his col
league (Hanna) and said:
1 am not the keeper of the President"" con
fidence. I have no doubt, however, that thÂ«
President spoke from his highest conviction
and best sentiment. No doubt he would pre
fer free trade with Porto Rico, as woul4 I.
but he probably knows more than ha knew
when he promulg-ated that messase. and. know
lnar more. It Is his duty as a man and as aa
official to change his recommendation.
The discussion of the question of consti
tutional law was continued until 5 o'clock.
Hoar made the closing observation, in
which he took sharp Issue with the prin
ciples enunciated by Foraker. He hel<t
that the doctrine proposed to be appil.-.l
to Porto Rico and the Philippines would
result In a despotism, and it would bo
none the less a despotism because It was
to be carried Into effect by moral mea of
high civilization. <'â¢:

ENCOURAGING BOYS
TO COMMIT CRIME
After Hearing a Pawnbroker's Evi-

to Be Arrested.
Hiram Edwards, a pawnbroker at 29
Folsom avenue, was a witness fqr the
prosecution yesterday in Judge Conlan's
court In the case of Edwin Smith, charged
with burglary for breaking Into the store
of E. H. Mitchell, 225 Post street. He
testified that he had purchased from
Smith fifteen purses, part of the plunder,
for $1 25, although they were worth over
$20.
The Judge, after holding Smith to an
swer before th<? Superior Court In J2OOO
bonds, ordered that a warrant be Issued
for Edwards' arrest on the charge of re
ceiving Btolen goods, declaring that it was
such men who encouraged boys to steal.
The warrant was sworn out before Judge
Mogan. Mitchell being the complaining
witness. There, ls a doubt as to whether
Edwards can be prosecuted, as he made
the entry of the purchase In his books,
thereby conforming with the law.
ATLANTIC LINERS TO
USE MARCONI'S SYSTEM
Steamships of North German Lloyd
Company Will Be Fully Equipped
for Wireless Telegraphy.
NEW YORK. March S.â The North Ger
man Lloyd line will adopt the Marconi,
system of wireless telegraphy on its fast
vessels as a means of communicating with
the land on each side of the Atlantic.
Gustav H. Schwab, general managing
agent, will urge the erection of a lofty
mast on the Nantucket south shoal light
ship, about 240 miles from Fire Island.
This will enable steamships to communi
cate with New York fifteen or sixteen
hours before they reach their pier. â¢
A series of experiments conducted on
the Kaiser WJlhelm der Grosse, which
has arrived here, was successful in every
way. From a sprit which had been run
up from the mainmast until its tip was
135 -feet above the deck one of Marconi's
electrical engineers, who was on board,
communicated satisfactorily with Borkum
Island, in the mouth of the Ems. On the
Island of Borkum had been planted a mast
185 feet high. Owing to the disparity In
the height of the spars the Borkum sta
tion received messages from the. Kaiser
Wllhelm der Grosse while the ship was
fifty miles away, whereas the ship re
ceived messages from the Island only at a
distance of thirty-five miles. Greetings
and business messages were exchanged
by Captain Bartelmann with the officials
of the line In .Bremen.

INLAND CITY SEEKS
FOR TERMINAL RATES
San Bernardino Has Secured Hearing
Before Interstate Commerce
Commission.
San Bernardino will try to have the In
terstate Commissioners establish It In
business as a terminal point, which would
give It terminal rates. Before the Inter
state Commissioners listen to the defense
made by the Jobbers of Los, Angeles
against the suit of those of the Middle
West the San Bernardino terminal mat
ter will come up. It Involves the question
of graded rates based upon mileage, which
Is one of the points In the St. Louis pro
gramme to which the Jobbers' and Manu
facturers' Association has strongly ob
jected. San Bernardino is not a tide water
point. It has not the geographical posi
tion to permit it to claim to be a com
petitive point by sea. It stands in pre
cisely the same attitude, so far as the
question of competition with other points
is concerned, as. any other Inland town.
For this reason the Pacific Coast Job
bers' and Manufacturers' Association will
be Interested. 'If the mileage basis Is ap
plied to San Bernardino It must also apply
to Salt Lake and other, places. The claim
of the Pacific Coast generally to differen
tials rests upon the foundation of geo
graphical location and sea competition
that has been' the chief argument ad
vanced In justification of them. Once the-
Interstate Commerce Commission, sev
eral years ago, ruled that San Bernardino
should be a terminal. That was over
turned by a decision In the Federal court
at -Los Angeles.' .
WHEELS OF JUSTICE
WILL NOT BE CLOGGED
The Mayor Has Promised to Bec

grapher.
The congestion of business in the Police
Courts owing to the lack of stenographers
Is practically at an end, the Mayor having
promised to recommend to the Board of
Supervisors at Monday's meeting that an
additional stenographer be appointed.
He was waited upon yesterday by the
four Judges and Attorneys Kstee, J. J.
Dunne. Salomon, Stafford. Graham and
Gallagher, and the facts as already pub
lished were laid before him. He acknowl
edged the justice of the demand, pleading
as an excuse for action not having b*en
taken sooner the financial stringency. The
etf-nographer to be appointed will have to
take his rhances on getting paid.
The Judges will meet this morning,
Â¦when a stenographer will be chosen.
TherÂ»Â» are several applicants for the job,
but Hovard Yerr.on will In all probability
be the lucky man.

BISPHAM'S ART
IS UNDENIABLE
The general verdict after yesterday's
concert at the California Theater must
have been that it surpassed the first hi
Interest and effect. Mr. Damrosch was
more than ever happy In his exposition of
Wagner's thought and purpose, and both
Madame Gadskl and Mr. Bispham exceed
ed themselves In their singing of the
music assigned to them.
The theme of the afternoon was "The
Flying Dutchman," which, like "Tann
hauser," is among the composer's earlier
works, but Mr. Damrosch demonstrates
how, even at the period In which the
opera was written, the Wagnerian princi
ples of theme-expression and the subserv
ience of the melodic to the dramatic ele
ment were in more than an experimental
stage. How. much these doctrines were
developed and amplified In the later
music-dramas needs not the telling, but
the extent to which they are used in the
very beginning of Wagner's career Is a
matter of historical and educational In
terest. â¢
After a few remarks of the legendary
character and origin of the story of the
"Flying Dutchman," Mr. Damrosch began
his setting forth of the Wagnerian ver
sion by an interesting analysis of the over
ture, In which are embodied all the lead-
Ing motives of the opera. He spoke with
pertienco and simplicity, but also with
a certain plcturesqueness of diction that Is
admirably adapted to the poetical charac
ter of his subject.
His ability as a lecturer is balanced to a
nicety by his skill as a pianist, although
he deprecates the applause that his mas
terly playing evokes. In illustrating the
"spinning chorus" yesterday he gave a
brief planlstic Impression of the music
which he ended rather abruptly, and In
lesponse to an enthusiastic demand for a
completion' of the passage said: "If
I had my orchestra with me I would
play It for you, but I am not a pianist
and cannot." And yet this man who says
he Is not a pianist makes more of these
piano scores of Wagner than any ordinary
artist could, and displays the evidences
of an absolute virtuosity.
Mr. Bispham's singing of the Dutchman
was finely artistic and noble in "Its
superb effectiveness. The Intensely dram
atic music of Vanderdecken Is well suited
to his powers and nothing could be better
than his interpretation of It. The high
order of his art is sustained throughout
each and all of his numbers. There Â¦is
never the suggestion of weakness nor
careless execution, but Instead.a.contin
ued charm, brilliance and Impressivenesa
that command unlimited admiration.
Mr. Blppham Is not perhaps the greatest
singer that has ever visited San Fran
cisco, but he is without doubt the most
absolute artist. . - ;
Madame Gadskl sang with great charm
yesterday. She was at her very best,
which is saying a great deal. Her inter
pretation of Senta's music is one of sym
pathy and insight. 5 .â¢.-"'".Â¦â¢Â¦>
There will be a concert at the Califor
nia Theater this afternoon at 2:15. The

ing schemes of sandwich men. caricatures
iuid others now being inflicted upon the
public. The ordinance provides that It
phall be unlawful to maintain a fence, or
other structure of a greater height than
ten feet from the street level for the pur
rose of painting thereon any sign or ad
vertisement or posting thereon bills of any
description. H. L. Green appeared In be
half of the bill posting advertisers. He
presented a communication setting forth
the merits of his side of the case. He was
followed by W. J. Martin, business man
cger of The Call, who represented th<?
publishers and printers of this city In
their petition requesting the passage of
the order. Mr. Martin argued on the
broad lines of beautifying the city and the
elimination of everything that would in
any way mar that beauty. He stated that
the ordinance under consideration was
Â¦imilar to the San Jose measure. He
favored the passage of an ordinance
similar to one now In effect in New York.
Mr. Green replied that he was willing to
remove all fences over twenty feet high
End agreed that his fences on public prop
erty be restricted to ten feet In height.
Protests were also read against the pre
vailing advertisements in the nature of
cement barrels, unsightly clocks, parties
on stilts and arrayed In various absurd
costumes, ar.d as a result the ordinance
*ill be redrafted to include the prohibition
of those objectionable displays.
The committee also decided In favor of
recommending the conversion of the Hos
pital Park lot into a public park at the ex
pense of the property owners in the vicin
ity, provided the Park Commissioners pre
serve It as such. .
Resolutions will be recommended provid
ing that the Spring Valley Water Works
be directed to take up the four-Inch

Old Presidio Prison to Be Torn Down.
Two Prisoners Escape From
Their Guards.
â¢ It has been ordered that to-day the
guard at the Presidio will take quarters
in the new guardhouse at the foot of the
Inner parade ground. The new guard
house has been under course of construc
tion for some months, the delay being
caused by various difficulties in getting
the stone and dressing it. It will hold all
the prisoners the Presidio will furnish for
years to come.
It is somewhat difficult to see where the
new guardhouse will flt In the general
plan tor the rebuilding of the post. Tho
plan of rebuilding contemplates a broad
parade plane extending from the present
brick barracks on the west to what is now
officers' row on the cast, with all the
wooden buildings now standing removed.
The headquarters Is to be at the base ot
the hills to the south, as is the hospital.
The flagstaff will be in front of the Head
quarters, and It has generally been sup
posed that the guardhouse . should be
near it so that the guard might be parad
ed at the colors with the prisoners, but
the new guardhouse will be at the other
end of the parade plane and half a mile
away from the headquarters. The new
guardhouse is a modern structure In every
way and is in Its present place for good.
The old guardhouse will probably be torn
down as soon as the quartermaster's de
partment can have it condemned.
Two prisoners brought over from Alca
traz to work on the grounds of the general
hospital escaped from their guards last
Wednesday and have not since been
caught. The guards responsible have been
placed under arrest.
The wall raised over the placing of some
of the dead from the Hancock in the old
volunteer officers' kitchen has resulted In
havine the bodies removed and piled on
top of those already in the old i. M. C.
A. building. Whether It Is better to have
the bodies two deep and making It corre
spondingly- hard to get at those on the
bottom row or place them by themselves
under proper guard In an unused building,
even though at one time It was a kitchen.
Is what the post commander Is waiting to
see decided.
Orders excluding enlisted men from the
UHe of the board walk from the cars to the
officers' quarters have been- revived, and
now the men must use the road or stay
in barracks. The order is a relic of the
times whÂ»n the volunteers, fresh from
the equality of civil life, took possession
of the walk originally intended for the
officers and made it a trysting place and
a convenient locality for an evening stroll.
The order excluding the enlisted men from
the walk was first put in operation then,
but It coon lapsed Into a state of lnopera
tlon. It was revived for a while a few
months ago and again dropped out of
sight. Now It has been brought up once
more. The regulars of the garrison never
abused the privilege allowed them, but
they have to suffer for those who did, for
the order makes no discrimination.
AUTOMOBILE SPECIALTIES BY CLUB MEMBERS.
f"" it the Smiling Public Will See When
Our New Horseless Carriage Drivers
Roll Through Golden Gate Park to
Slow Music and Active Mishaps.
SCORE of men. automobilious of
temperament :- and daring â¢of
I \ spirit, forgathered at . the Cliff
I^4 House on Wednesday afternoon
I 1 with the set purpose of organlz
,m Ing an automobile club. Without
? much , ado they, accomplished
their design. And now let the public look
to Its safety, for these men know no fear.
If necessary they will ride the very devil
to the ground and smile at the wake of
their sport.
"Why shouldn't we organize," said J.
M. WJlklns. "We need protection, and
think of , the fun when we all steam on
parade behind Bweet music. Of course,
there'lHbe an accident or two, but what
of that? I may run Into a lamp post and
put it out of business, but what of that?
Lamp' posts only work half the time now,
and we'll furnish enough stars to light
the city."
"What I do not understand," said Her
mann Oelrlchs, "Is the absence of a strong
automobile organization. You have your
automobile coats, and why not the car
riages? With aJI this fair weather we
might enjoy a parade similar to our swell
Fifth-avenue show in New York. Noth
' Ing would please me more than to take
my dear friend, Alec Hamilton, out for
a ride. If the machine jumps the trol
ley the seal rocks would serve as a sta
tion en route to the land of the Geisha,
girls. Alec's fishy tales on the home
coming would at least have a semblance
of truth."
No more talk of fleet-footed "Our Dick"
like again? 'Twas the only horse that
ever won my love, "and I gave her away.
I'm horseless now, so I'll take to the tall
timber and buy an Ought Mo Bill. Some
night when the Maud days are forgotten
I'll go up Strawberry Hill and then come
down again, talking to the dashboard for
company."
The club has expressed Itself as being
on a friendly footing with all equine road
sters. There is no malice prepense in
these riders of the electric or steam cart.
When the park Is studded with the heav
ily tired automobiles every effort will be
made by the owners to court the goodwill
and companionship of the fleet-footed
pacer and trotter. ,
" 'Side by each' we will go together," Is
the refrain to all their songs. "Nay,"
cries the horseman, "you will not."
In the days of the future, when the
crowd gathers on the Cliff House porch,
long coats, pearl buttons and all, the taJk
will not be of . "skivers," "getting away
left foot first," "wigglers," "side-wheel
ers," "went up in the air" and "breaking
thimble straps." It will be "foot pound

WHITE STRIPES
TO BE WORN ON
THEIR TROUSERS
Changes to Be Made in the
Uniforms of the Police
Force.
The lle\r Rules to Bs Adopted by
the Commissioners Will Have
a Tendency to Smarten
the Men Up.
The new rules compiled by the police
eaptaisa .it the request of Chief Sullivan
v.lii be formally adopted by the Com
missioners at their next meeting:. Each
Commissioner was furnished with a copy
at the meeting last Tuesday night, so
as to make himself conversant with them
Lefore their adoption.
Tte most important alteration Is in re
gard to the uniforms. The Chief had no
ticed that as a rule an officer's coat was
In good order, but his trousers were
shabby, which was accounted for by the,
?act that the coats are put away in the
Icekers when the men are off duty, but
the trousers are constantly worn. To put
Â«n end to this discrimination against the
trousers In future they will have a white
etripe, something like those worn by the
officers In tne regular army. Therefore.
â¢when a policeman reports off duty he will
have to doff his trousers as well as hla
coat.
The blue chevrons and service stripes
Will also be changed to white, as there
Is difficulty in distinguishing them, ow
ing to the fact that the uniform Is blue
also. The gold service stripes now in use
Â¦will be retained. The men's coats will
also be worn a little shorter, to within
three Inches above the bend of the knee,
co as to present a smarter appearance.
Captains Instead of wearing a double
breasted coat will wear what is known in
military circles as the service uniform
coat.
The other rules are about the same as
before, although In come instances they
ere made stricter In reference to the men
talking or loitering- on their beats, en
tering saloons and attending theaters.
A notable change has also be?n made
regarding the detectives. ThÂ«Â»y have been
in the habit of going and coming at their
own pleasure, and often when they were
In demand for a case they could not be
found. Now they have to write on a
Flip where they have gone, the time of
leaving the office and the time of their
return. These slips are kept by the cap
tain, so that he knows at once where to
find any of his men. The detectives for
merly had every alternate Sunday off
duty, liut that is now stopped.
The men must also drill for half an
hour each day. under the supervision of
the new drill instructor. Gaughran. He
ha.Â« reported to the Chief that the new
pysttm is working well and some of the
heavy-weights are beginning to lose their
rotundity of form. The men are taking
kindly to the exercise.

PURE FOOD REGULATIONS.
BY the Committee on .Manufactures there has
been submitted to the Senate a report showing
the results of investigations into the adultera
tion of articles of food or drink, together with recom
mendations as to the best means of providing a rem
edy for the evil. The report declares that the practice
of selling adulterated foods and artificial substitutes
for pure foods is widespread. Many of those engaged
in the selling or the manufacture of such adultera
tions or substitutes franjkly admit it, but claim they
are forced to resort to it by the competition of the
market.
Two methods of applying a remedy for the evil have
been proposed. One is to place all important articles
of food or drink under the internal revenue law, as
has been done with butter, cheese and flour. The
other is the establishment in the Department of Ag
riculture of a bureau with authority to fix the stan
dard of purity for foods, drinks and drugs. A part
of this plan provides also for an examination of all
imported articles of food or drink, as it is said
large amounts of adulterated foods of foreign manu
facture are imported and sold here, although their
sale to consumers is forbidden in the countries where
they are manufactured.
Of the two plans proposed the committee favors the
latter. It is conceded the first has worked well so far
as it has been applied, and it is said the pure flour
law has absolutely prevented the sale of adulterated
flour in this country, and, moreover, has so increased
its reputation abroad that the sale of American flour
in foreign markets has increased 25 per cent. Never
theless the committee thinks it would be inexpedient
to put all articles of food under the internal revenue
law, because it would be cumbersome and vexatious
to the trade and to the consumers to require a stamp
to be affixed to every package of foods of all kinds
offered for sale.
The people of the country are not devoted to any
p?rticular plan of action on the subject. Almost. any.
well devised law will suit them, provided it have a
national scope and be fairly enforced. State statutes
or. local ordinances on the subject have proven ut
terly inadequate to deal with the evil. As there is no
way of preventing the import and export of goods
from one State to another, a suppression of the manu
facture of impure foods in any commonwealth has no
other effect than that of conferring an advantage upon
the manufacturers' of, impure foods in other States.
A bureau of the Department of Agriculture having
authority to fix the standard for all articles of food
and drink, and to require all such articles to be rightly
HUMANITY TO THE BOERS.
IN another column we print an appeal to the people
of the United States by the New York committee,
of which Hon. George M. Van Hoesen is chair
man. ,
Judge Van Hoesen is of an old New York Knick
erbocker family, dating from the -first Dutch settle
ment in New Amsterdam. After a successful expe
rience in journalism in lowa when a young man, he
returned to New York and entered upon the success
ful practice of the law, and in due time was elected to
the bench, and served in the judicial office with high
distinction for a long term of years.
We give this sketch of his career to properly dif
ferentiate him from the crowd of self-seeking poli
ticians who use the Boer question merely as a useful
play upon the sentiment of hereditary enmity to Eng
land. Judge Van Hoesen, like the majority of Ameri
cans, would feel no differently toward the two South
Alrican republics if their enemy were Germany, Rus
sia or France.
It must be remembered that the Boer population is
not numerous. Women are in the trenches fighting
by. the side of their husbands, fathers and sons for the
liberty of their country and the integrity of their fire :
sidesi Want, illness and suffering are abroad among
them. No cause has ever appealed more strongly to
the humane sympathies of the world than theirs.
Some Americans, with much ostentation, have con
tributed a hospital ship and stores to Great Britain.
They, are going up to the help of Goliath against
David. Let the masses of our people show their
sympathy with the weak against the strong. 'This
great republic should not hesitate to succor the dis
tressed farmers of South Africa who are in. straits and
misery in the midst of the agonies of defense against
the world's greatest empire. .
The people of all nations have been thrilled not
only by their courage and endurance under suffering,
but by. their; own humanity toward the soldiers of
their mighty enemy. English authorities have been
compelled to disclose the kindness shown by Boers to
the British- wounded on the battle-field. Boer sol
diers have given their last mealie and drop of. water
to suffering English soldiers who fell smitten in -ac
tion.
They have shown no spirit of revenge, nor have
they been careless of the demands of a humane spirit,
in the midst of their own misfortunes.-
Surely that widespread sympathy for the abused
Cubans which swept over this country in 1898 was not
a fleeting show, a passing fashion! : Pity's sweet foun
tain in the hearts of our people" must still be affluent,
and we count surely upon the extension of substan
tial aid and comfort to the people embattled upon the
far veldts of j Africa, whose stout hearts have not
quailed in their awful loneliness among the nations.;
It is a pleasure to certify the high character, of the
New York committee and to assure Californians that
whatever funds are intrusted to Judge Van Hoesen
will produce for every dollar a hundred cents' worth
of benefit to the people who need from the people of
the world that friendship which is denied to them by
the nations of the world. Â¦>

A PARADOX.
Herr Muller was a Government clerk,
and when he retired on a pension ths
newspapers published a paragraph tQ this
effect:
"After working thirty years in Govern
ment offices Herr Muller retires to private
life, and will, with his wife, enjoy a well
earned rest."
This shows Herr -Muller at work, and
SANITARY POLITICS.
THE straining for effect on the part of Mayor
Phelan's board of political health and his
Chief of Police has provoked the whole city,
outside ihe bum brigade which spends its time in al
nrnately tom-toming the Mayor's fame and kow
towing when the little great man walks abroad.
The Chinatown quarantine proceedings and the evil
repute of the Board of Health have put the city in a
very embarrassing position. The motives of that
Luard have been exposed, its threats of coercion of
tho Supervisors to get more money are made public,
and now there is a feeling that it is entirely capable of
falsifying the revelations of a scientific investigation
01 the deiid Chinaman's glands, if, indeed, it have the
ab ; lity to make any scientific investigation at all. The
board stands discredited and under permanent sus
picion. San Francisco is advertised to the ends of tha
c:rth as an infected city, before there was a single
fact known to justify it. Ships for other seaports will
b< refused a clean bill of health from this harbor, and
travel will be suspended or checked at a season when
it- presence is most desirable.
As far as the Chief of Police is concerned his
blockade was a dress parade, a false pretense and a
fham. Hundreds of Chinese escaped it. passed his
r<*pe barrier and his line of sentries, and. if there were
infection in the Chinese quarter, had the chance to
c: rry it to thousands of white people all over the city.
Tiic blockade, therefore, served no purpose as a pro
tiction to the city. and. was a sham of the flimsiest
kind. But, .vhile it served no good purpose and was
no protection to our population if the pretext for ii
really existed and the plague were present, it inflicted
th* ultimate of harm upon the city by flashing abroad
a< a certainty that pestilence was upon us. The
Mayor's organ, the Examiner, was quick to spread
the news throughout the East and to back the follies
of its political pets to the utmost. Bad news travels
last, and while San Francisco is being posted all
around the world as a plague city, the Mayor's Board
of Health is leisurely doing politics. It has taken the
platids of a Chinaman who died after a month's ii 1 1 â
ikss. supervening upon a chronic ailment of longer
standing, and has inoculated a guinea-pig with them
and is waiting for the pig to die! It is highly prob
able that infection with either the chronic or acute
diseases that were in partnership in destroying the
Chinaman will kill the guinea-pig. The microbe of
bubonic plapue is as discernible in the glands of a
humr-n victim as in the body of a guinea-pig.
One does not need to isolate Mayor Phelan's Board
of Health and Chief of Police and inoculate a hog
with them to identify them as political microbes in
the body politic of San Francisco, who are under sus
picion even when they are right. If the Board of
Health had good reason for the scare and quarantine
the blockade maintained was without efficiency,
through the failure of the police to maintain it"". If
the Hoard of Health found the plague in Chinatown
the Chief of Police allowed it to escape and roam
the whole city at will. If the Chinese carry it about
tbem. it entered the kitchens of hundreds of homes
and hotels all over town, in the person of Chinese
cooks and waiters, who found it easier to run the
blockade than to win at fantan against a white player
who had never seen the game before.
INSURANCE SCHEMES
of Railroads.
The Call does. not hold itself responsible for
thÂ« opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general Interest.
Editor The Callâ l have noted with care
all that has been published regarding the
independent â¢ Insurance scheme of the
Southern Pacific Railway Company, lim
ited to its employes. Certain recent oc
currences, not necessary to detail here,
called my attention to the , fact that up
to this time no employe of that com
pany aged or disabled in its service has
ever become a public charge in the State
of California nor been compelled to enter
a' poorhouse.
Its present Insurance scheme is of in
terest to me as a taxpayer and to all my
fellow citizens of California who are tax
payers. It takes in all present employes,
without medical examination, regardless
of age and physical condition, though at
least 60 per cent of them would be barred
out of participation in any other form of
insurance. If killed in the service of the
company I believe the indemnity is S3OOO,
and the ordinary death Indemnity Is $1500.
I believe, also that hospital facilities go
with the system. The great Pennsylva
nia Railroad has for years operated a
similar scheme, and out of its experience
and accumulations has now. been able to
add a pension system to aged and inca
pacitated employes, who retire from ac
tive service upon a pension that assures
their support and makes them independ
ent of charity.
Now, as a citizen I approve and applaud
the institution by a great corporation of
such a scheme as assures to ita thousands
of. employes immunity from pauperism, no
matter what accident and incapacity may
befall them. By enforcing the habits of
temperance and thrift necessitated by
such a system it becomes an ally of pub
lic morals and by securing Its employes
against the need of charity it relieves the
taxpayer. Â¦:
I wish that such a system might be
made 1 common to all corporations and
companies and individuals which employ
large numbers of men, for it would in
crease the number of perfectly independ
ent-men and families in the community
and decrease the numbers of the needy
and dependent.
I hope that eventually a Southern Pa
cific pension system will grow out of this
and that thereby the lives of its thousands
of employes may be delivered. of much of
the care which is upon men.

GETTING READY FOR WORK.
WHILE Republicans in all parts of the Union
are confident the coming election will result in
an overwhelming defeat of the Bryanites, they
are not going to take any chances of losing a single
Congressman through a neglect of organized . work;
All reports are to the effect that throughout the East
the party is preparing for an earnest and -vigorous
campaign, animated by a desire to rid the country of
the mischievous free silver agitation for the rest of
this generation. . .
;It T is not yet clear upon what issues the coming
contest will be fought, although it is certain the re
nomination of Bryan will give ah immense importance
to the money question, and that it may be again, as
it was in 1896, the dominant question in the minds of
the voters. It is well known, however, that many
Democratic leaders are groping for a new issue, being
sagacious- enough to know that another fight for free
silver will be equivalent to marching through a
slaughter-house to an open grave. It is therefore
likely the tactics of the opposition will be to confuse
the campaign by a multitude of issues, leaving' the
candidates and stump speakers in each district to give
prominence to the one most likely to be favored in
that locality. .
Â¦'Â¦Â¦ Such being the case, we shall probably have the sil
ver question put prominently forward in the silver
States and in the. South, where the Democrats are
generally in favor of imperialism, while anti-imperial
ism and anti-trust* issues will be made conspicuous
in the East. Thus the Republicans will have to con
front something like a guerrilla warfare, and must be
prepared for it.
It is evident that such tactics on the part of the
Bryanites will be more dangerous to candidates in
Congressional districts than to Presidential electors.
It is quite, possible: the .election should result in an
overwhelming victory for the national ticket and yet
leave the Republicans with a minority in the House
of Representatives.- By carrying one district for free
silver and imperialism, and another district for anti
trust and anti-imperialism, the Democrats, while
being divided among themselves, might after all pre
vent that complete Republican victory which is essen
tial for the best interests of, the country.
The important point of the campaign, therefore, is
to assure victory in the Congressional districts. To
that end 'everything shouldbe done to provide for
thorough 'organization and complete harmony in the
party ranks. The greatest care should be taken 10
assure nominations for Congress that will be satis
factory to the rank and file of the party. Nothing in
the way of snap judgment, boss rule or faction trick
ery in the selection of candidates for Congress should
be permitted. The party must put forward as its lead
er^' strong, able and upright men in every district, or
we, may have the chagrin of seeing a Democratic ma
jority in a Congress elected in a year of Republican
prosperity.

President Wheeler is quite right in - desiring the
Berkeley team of track athletes to go East to com
pete with the teams of Eastern universities, but his
argument on the subject, "I wish you to show the
East we 'are civilized out here, and this is one of the
best ways to do it," is rather curious. Why send a
team to show the Easterners we are civilized? Why
not send it just fibr the fun of licking the tenderfeet?

ANOTHER IMPERIAL PENSIONER.
THE country has become reconciled to paying
the ' Mahometan Sultan of Sulii and his chiefs
a pension of $10,000 a year for consenting to let
the stars and stripes float- over his â¢harem and his
slaves. General Wheeler has visited and dined with
our Sultan and reports the feed good and hi 3
Majesty's hospitality fair for those parts.
This being settled, we are now extending our.im
perial pension system to the ex-Queen of Hawaii.
The diplomatic appropriation bill provided for pay
ing her a lump sum of $250,000. On the motion of
Senator Hoar this has been amended to a cash pay
ment of $20,000 and an annual pension of $10,000.
We heartily approve of this pension, for it. is an. ac
knowledgment of the illegality and injustice of our
overthrow of her sovereignty, and theft of her coun
try.
The so-called revolution of 1893 was nothing more
nor less than the overthrow by an American naval
commander and man-of-war of a Government with
which we were at peace and in diplomatic relations,
and the independence of which we had guaranteed by
solemn treaty. There was no revolution. There was
a conspiracy between foreigners domiciled in Hawaii
and the American Minister and the commander of the
Boston. It was an exact counterpart of the Jameson
raidÂ»upon the Transvaal, with the sole difference that
our Government made no pretense of disavowal,
while England did have sufficient regard for interna
tional decency to call Rhodes and Jameson to ac
count.
But we then proceeded upon the pretense that the
people of Hawaii had by revolution overthrown a
dynasty and proclaimed a republic. That genius of
evil, Senator Morgan of Alabama, made his cele
brated speech about crowns that fall in this hemis
phere lying where they drop. Dole took over to him
self the Queen's estate in the crown lands, and as pub
lic property captured the regalia and muniments of
the ancient royalty and sold them at auction for junk.
He seized the great Hawaiian flag, made of silk and
presented as a personal gift to the Queen by the na
tive ladies, and gave it to the daughter of Congress
man Berry of Kentucky.- If it were public property
he had no right to give it away. If it were not pub
lic property Miss Berry is in possession of stolen
goods.
After all these acts and pretenses have ended in an
nexation of the islands as something their sovereignty
in the Dole Government had a right to do, the United
States Congress admits that it was by robbery and
not by right that the Queen was despoiled, and com
pels our people to pay her conscience money down
and a pension of $10,000 a year!
It is an act of justice to her, though there is, no law
nor constitutional authority for such use of the public
funds. It is an admission that we wronged her, that
we took from her that to which we had no right. It
can bÂ« justified on no other ground. If the annexa
tion of Hawaii were what the Government pretended
it was, an agreement with a justly established foreign
sovereignty that had a right to merge with ours, we
would be under no legal nor moral obligation to pay
the Queen any sum whatsoever. The resolution of
annexation neither created nor recognized any such
obligation. By it we agreed to pay President Dole's
debts, amounting to about $5,000,000, and that was
the sole financial responsibility which we assumed by
law.
The Call has held to this view of the proceeding
from the beginning, and is amply justified ' by thi*
proposition to pay a pension for a sovereignty which
this Government pretended had passed to it by as
sent and not by purchase. It is an admission that the
honorable course for the United States would have
been to replace the Queen in possession of her sov
eteignty, of which our Minister and our navy had de
prived her, nnd then negotiate with her Government
for annexation, if that policy were desirable. But we
did not do this. We treated the Dole Government as
of right in power, and according to the theory upon
which we took over the islands we should pension
Dole instead of the Queen.

LOS ANGELES. March B.â The long
drought was broken on the 4th instant by
rain, which was general in Southern Cali
fornia, and although it varied considera
bly in different sections, It was of inesti
mable benefit wherever it- fell. A partial
grain crops at least is promised in many
places where total loss was feared. Feed
and hay, which had been suffering se
verely, Â¦ are greatly benefited and in
creased.
Deciduous fruit trees continue to bloom
freely, considerably earlier than usual,
and po far there has been no damage to
them from frost. Fair weather is pre
dicted for to-night and to-morrow.
Santa Barbara Countyâ lndications of
another dry year are stimulating water
development.
Ventura Countyâ Rain on the 4th Instant
has retrieved Â¦ barley In some localities,
but late sown grain, like the early sown,
is in some places drying up.
San Bernardino Countyâ A good rain
fell on the 4th, with snow in- the moun
tains. Some early sown grain wa* past
help, but with a few more showers there
should be a fair" crop. Fruit trees are
bldoming freely.
Riverside Countyâ ln the Immediate
vicinity of Riverside grain is almost a
total failure. In other localities late
sown grain is still looking rairly well, but
rain must. come soon to save even the lat
est. Pastures are drying fast and irriga
tion is being resorted to. The rain of the
4th inst. revived crops to some extent
Fruit buds are advancing.
Orange Countyâ The rain which fell last
Sunday will carry considerable grain in
good condition for about two weeks
longer. A portion is beyond recovery.
San Diego Countyâ A light rain on the
4th instant helped grain greatly, but much
more is needed. Some grain is a total
failure and will not. yield even pasture.
Grain is looking well in the mountain
valleys. Peach trees are in .bloom.
FRESNO, March B.â The crops In this
vicinity have been greatly benefited by
the recent rain,' amounting to .83 of an
inch. .
SAN JOSE. March B.â Warm I showers
and rain have been falling here at in
tervals for five days, aggregating for' the
storm 1.75 inches and for the season 12.70.
The winter has been characterised by an
unusual amount .of' warm,' growing
weather, and vegetation of all kinds is
more luxuriant. than it has been for. many
years.
STOCKTON.. March B.â San Joaduin
County never had a better crop outlook
and the season is almost sure to be one
of the best in the history of the county
Everywhere the reports are favorable and
in some of the reclaimed districts it has
been found recessary to cut back grain
that stood a foot and a half high. The
rains of the present month have been
sufficient for all sections and on the west
side of the San Joaquin River where the
crops were a bit backward the downpour
was all that was needed. Fruit men also
give cheering reports and no fear of
trouble from frost is felt at "this time
The rainfall for the past twenty-four
hours was .30 and for the month 1 67
.inches, making 12.67 for., the season
against 4.08 at the same time last year '
SALINAS. March 8.-Salinaa Valloy in
particular and Monterey County in gen
eral has been treated to a most copious
rain in the last week, and the storm still
continues. All crops are now assured
while in some Instances an enormous yield
will result from the present storm. The
Spreckels Sugar Company will plant a
Jarge acreage of sugar beets.
E BAKERSKIELD; March 8.-The rainfall
to date Is 4.10 inches. It has been heavier
in the northern part of Kern County anÂ«i

that his ship would beat the entire fleet
to Queenstown. Last year the Kelburn
made a fast run to Liverpool, and Captain
Jones figures on making as good time
this year, bo he lost no time in covering
Captain Shapland's bet.
Before the Kelburn. Peleus and Lyder
horn were out of sight of the lightship,
the Cromdale, General Gordon, Heath
field and Paul Isenberg were under way.
Among these vessels it is a toss-up as to
which will win. Out of the ten vessels
now on their way to England the Celtic
Monarch. Aristides and Peleus have the
best records and have the call in the bet

The transport Warren, which was re
leased from quarantine yesterday, is to
receive a thorough overhauling before she
again sails for Manila. She went into
commission on July 25, 185S, and has been
in constant service ever since. On that
day ,the German flag was hauled down
CHIEF OFFICER F. E. MAGUNE.
from the main top of the Scandia and a
few minutes latar the American flag went
aloft on the Warren. Captain Hart took
command of the transport and the en
gines were turned over to Chief Engineer
French. These gentlemen have been at
the head of affairs in the Warren ever
since.
On this last voyage the Warren has
covered 18.000 miles without a breakdown
or stoppage of any kind due to an acci
dent. She sailed from here on December
2 with part of the Forty-ninth Infantry,
and after landing the men at Manila she.
went to Hollo with Colonel Bird and
Major Miles. From Iloilo she went to
Jolo, an island near Borneo, and from
there she went to Samboango, and then
back to Manila. Another start was made
from Manila and the transport went to'
Hongkong to coal. From there she went
to Guam, Honolulu and then to San Fran
cisco. . Â¦
Chief Officer F. E. Magune of the War
ren was the recipient of a very flattering
letter of thanks from the lieutenant col
onel of the Forty-ninth when the vessel
reached Manila. It was as follows:
On Board U. S. A. T. Warren.
New Tear's Day. ISOO.
F. E. Magune, First Officerâ Dear Sir: I
do not wish to leave the ship without express
ing to you my appreciation of your ability and
attention to duty. We all feel a sense of grati
tude toward you for your faithful performance
of duty in your department.
I sincerely hope that your next trip Â¦will be
as master of a fine transport, as it would be
to the best Interests of the service to have such
a man as you In charge of one of its valu
able ships. You have more than shown your
ability, and all In a modest and unpretentious
way which has endeared you to both officers
and men alike and has made us all your
friends. Yours very sincerely.
A. C. DUCAT.
Lieutenant Colonel Forty-ninth Infantry.
Mr. Magune has been. master of vessels
Railing in and out of San Francisco for
years, and ship owners know him as one
of the most honorable and careful of sail
ors afloat or ashore. Â¦ . .
The brig Pltcairn and the steamer Point
Arena were In collision early yesterday.
The Point Arena came in ahead of time,
as she was unable to call at a number of
ports on account of the southeaster.
While making her dock at Mission street
she ran ahead on her line and crashed
into the Pitcalrn, carrying away the lat
ter's bowsprit. The Pitcalrn was all
ready to sail for Cape Nome, so the acci
dent Is an unfortunate one for her, as It
will delay the sailing at least a week.
The steamer Ellhu Thomson has
changed hands again. She was purchased
a month or so ago by Scammell & Kink
of this city, and they In turn have sold
her to Charles P. Richardson of Taeoma.
The sale was conducted through Williams,
Dlmond & Co.
The transport Meade. which was sched
uled to *all on the 16th lnst., will proba
bly be detained a few days. Boiler tubes
necessary for repairs have not arrived
from the East and they will be respon
sible for the detention of the vessel.

TO ARRIVE.
rponse in the market a* It haa been fully
foreshadowed by the large absorption of gross
earnings in operating expenses. The reported
agreement of Western railroad presidents on
recommendations designed to harmonize dif
ferences over freights, the determination to
advance bituminous coal rates to the lakes
and additional gains reported in railroad earn
ings were all without effect on prices. The
published report of a proposed increase in the
next dividend on the preferred stock of the
Pittsburg, C. C. and St. Louts was met by
a drop in that stock of 3% points. Rio Grande
Western was notable for a Jump of nearly 8
points. There was continued doubt and appre
hension over the capacity of the money market
to get through without a pinch to the period
of relief by the operation of the currency bill.
The possibility was canvassed of action by the
Treasury Department to resume the deposit
of internal revenue collections with the banks,
but no authoritative sanction was given for
such possibility. The absorption of funds by
the New York sub-treasury since last Friday
had already reached $5,631,000 up to the close
of business last night. The total revenue sur
plus taken up by the Government since the
first of the month up to the same date
amounted to only $2,066,245. The special drain
thus indicated upon New York banks is due
to the large customs payments by Importers.
Imports at present are running very high as
an incident of the active demand for com
modities and the payment of the duties is
diverted from the New York banks Into the
sub-treasury. The demand for loans for the
purchase of Government bonds continues large.
These two factors threaten the early oblitera
tion of the surplus reserves of the New York
banks.
The bond market was not as active as yes
terday, but prices were firmly held. Total
sales, par value. $1,590,000.

4s % in the bid price.

London Market.
NEW YORK, March B.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were quiet and featureless
to-day, but the tone was cheerful on Lord
Roberts' advance 'and rumors of peace nego
tiations. A story was current that 3000 Boers
were offering to surrender. The Queen's visit
to London checked business. There was eager
blddinz on the new war loan at 1% to 2 pre
mium, although nothing is yet known of the
denomination or rriee. The expectation is for
a 2% loan at &8 or 98%, applications to be re
ceived at the postofflces in small sums. A
Treat rush Is certain. Americans werÂ» inac
tive and dull, collapses in the industrials be
ing feared. The bank bought Â£6000 of gold In
bars.
Call money was firm and bills were also firm,
though more plentiful. The bank renewed a
large amount of loans and did a fair fresh
business in loans and discounts. Silver reached
27 9-16 d on outside buylnr.

The New Financial Bill.
HOW IT IP REGARDED IN WALL STREET.
The Npw Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"Ati advance movement in this market is held
In check by the prospect of firm money for the
next three or four weeks and the Indisposition
of the big holders to pull together on the long
fide. There is no question whatever but that
the heavy operators are bulls for a long pull;
but for various reasons, Fuch as the troubles
In the traction and gas stocks, they are not
a unit; hence the market fails to respond to
thf many favorable conditions which are crop
ping to the surface almost dally. For the
I-rfsent the new gold standard law has little
effect, V.Â»oause its enactment has been a fore
gone conclusion for months. Later on. pos
eitily within a few months, it will have a still
further f-rtfet owing to the expansion of the
currency, which it will facilitate. There is
no r.e^d to fear undue inflation. By allowing
the bank* to issue circulation up to the par
value of the new 2 per cent bonds and re
ducing the tax on circulation from 1 per cent
TÂ«>r annum to % of 1 per cent. It is conserva
tively estimated that the bank note circula
tion may be Increased $100. 000,000 and possibly
more. This 1? an Important addition, and Is
likely to be much needed next autumn when
the usual crop demands pet In. Another ex
cÂ»l!*nt feature of the new bill Is the raising
at the treasury reserve from $100,000,000 to $150,
(KlO.Of'O gold, together with additional measures
of protection for thÂ» came. The treasury Is.
still taking funds from the banks. Since Jan
uary 1 there has been an expansion of about
JG0.000,000 in the loans of the associated banks."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March B.â The market waa
practically relieved to-day of all disturbing
factors in the way of acute weakness of special
stocks. Reports all continued favorable re
garding the outlook for values, but the de
mand for stocks was almost unappreclable.
Even the email buying for Investment based
on large earnings of railroads which has been
In evidence fcr some time past dropped out of
sight to-day. Speculators are refraining en
tirely from commitments for the advance.
On the other hand the bear operators of any
considerable caliber seemed to become dis
couraged by the futility of their efforts and
the culmination of events counted upon for
a. reaction. They made some demonstration
against People's Gas, Consolidated Gas and
Metropolitan Street Railway, but no effect was
produced on the general market. The room
traders tried to *et the sluggish train of prices
in motion In vain. The price changes were
scarcely, Â¦uillclent to cover a broker's commis
sion and the inertness of th* market increased
In proportion to the distance from last night's
level, the tendency being to come back to that
level from either below or above It. The iron
and eteel stocks were generally firm on en
couraging opinions expressed by authorities in
the trade. The maintenance of the St. Paul
dividend at the existing rate found do re-
CHICAGO. March B.â At the beginning of the
session in the wheat pit to-day there were two
considerations which were shortly afterward
lost sleht ofâ easier cables and the Price Cur
rent assertion that the marketable supply of
wheat was much greater than could be dis
tiibuted before a new crop. With these things
in mind the market opened easier. May %@V4o
down at 65%865%c to 65%<g65%c. The factors
in the easiness were soon eliminated, however,
by the strength of Liverpool for spot wheat'
under which the market reacted. As the ses
sion proceeded the bull position was further
fortlftfd by the strength of New York for cash,
talk of a big export businessâ so boatloadsâ
which was reported to have been done late
yesterday, and some uneasiness over reports
of more platrue cases In Argentina. May ad
vanced to 6Sc early and clung around that fig
ure for some time. Near the end of the session
renewed buying pressure resulted in a bulge
which carried May to 66% c. The close was
strong. May %c over yesterday at 66%@66%c.
â¢ The corn market was strong and fairly active
The opening was easy. May He lower In sym
pathy with the early dip In wheat, but there
after the course was upward. May closed %@
Me over yesterday.
Oats were dull but steady with corn and
closed firm. Receipts were moderate and the
shipping demand slow. May closed a shade
improved. '
The provision market opened unchanged, but
the development of a good cash demand, both
domestic and export, together with.light-offer
ings and the strength of grain, caused a rally
and some activity. Liverpool was 6d higher
for lard and the demand here was especially
good. May pork closed â¢ 17%@20c -* over yester
day. May lard 6Â®7%c up and May ribs 7%@10c
improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
The Day Was Hers.
For a good many years a modest young
man with a clean public record had a
praiseworthy ambition to be the Governor
of his State, said the Ohio State Journal
the day after Judge Nash waa inaug
urated. %
Upon more than one occasion the prize
seemed to be his, but another man won
The man was as patient as he was mod
est, and she who was the partner of his
hopesâ the sharer of his joyg and disap
pointments â consoled him with a wifely
tenderness that robbed defeat of its stinir
and kept alive the flame of his honorable
ambitions. She believed In him, thoujrht
the exigencies of politics overlooked her
hero. She knew him worthy of all honor
and when he seemed to falter it was her
whisper that recalled him to the goal She
never doubted the future. She knew the
nobility of the man herself and was con
fident. Â¦MnuÃjriÃ
â¢ Time went on and the greatest Brief
came to him. The wife died. More years
passed. The cycle of events swung a
gubernatorial nomination to him. A spirit
ed campaign of national importance fol
lowed, and then a triumphal victory Mo
mentous happenings crowded Into his life
He was the central figure of one State
with a nation of other States looking on.
The preparations for his induction into
office were elaborate and ceremonious.
The capital swarmed with a multitude In
hla honor. Inauguration day was his
day. â¢ â¢ â¢
_ As the sun camÂ© up a man drove
through the city Just awakening to the
important functions of the memorable
day, the greatest; and most brilliant ever
accorded a Governor of the State.
There was nothing, in the , modest con
veyance to excite attention. The man
took his way along the quiet streets and
across the city to the cemetery.
The Governor-elect stood alone beside a
grave that was sacred to him. There was
a- smaller- one beslde.it. The glorious
warmth of a gorgeous sunrise bathed the
earth.

OAKLAND, March B.â All of the furor
created over the possibility of Mrs. Laura
Smith lighting the divorce suit brought by
her husband. Rev. Guy W. Smith, pastor
of the First Christian Church of this city,
has gone for naught. Mrs. Smith has al
lowed the case to go by default, and to
day Court Commissioner Babcock heard
the testimony of the plaintiff and his wit

SHERIFF IS SUSPICIOUS.
Will Investigate the Alleged Suicide
of William Schwan.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March B.â Henry
Schwan, who resides on the Home Ranch
adjoining the Petrified Forest, arrived in
this city early this evening and reported
to the Sheriff that his brother William
had committed suicide. According: to the
story told by Henry he had heard the re
port of a rifle In the room occupied by his
brother, and rushing to the scene found
that ho had placed the muzzle of a rifle
in his mouth and In some manner pulled
the trigger. As the front of Henry s coat
was covered with blood the Sheriff be
came suspicious and he, with the District
Attorney, has gone to the ranch to make
a thorough investigation.
It Is known that both of the men have
been drinking heavily of late. It is also
known that a woman named Fields has
been living on the ranch for some time
and that William, the suicide, recently
had trouble over her with another man.
which ended in a fight. Considering all
these facts the Sheriff deemed It advisable
to go out to the ranch and make an in
vestigation In order to preclude the possi
bility of evidence of a crime being ob
literated. _
STEAMERS OVERDUE.
News of the Wolcott and Excelsior
Anxiously Watched For.
: SEATTLE, March B.â To March 4, the
date the Cottage City, which arrived In
port to-day, sailed from Sitka, no word
had been received from the . westward
steamer Wolcott,' and nothing had been
heard of the steamer Excelsior, which
wan then long overdue from Valdes.
The Cottage City's advices do not tend
to allay the anxiety which has prevailed
for weeks past concerning the Wolcott.
There la much uneasiness despite the re
port brought by the bark Mermaid to the
effect that the Wolcott sailed from-Una
laaka on her return to Sitka January 24.
These advices disclose that the Wolcott
had already consumed thirty-nine days In
the voyageâ more than twice the time she
ordinarily required In running from Un
alaska to Sitka. The Wolcott, under any
thlnir like favorable conditions, should
have reached Sitka ten days before the
sailing of the Cottage City. -
The perplexing situation Is intensified
from the fact that nothing is known tof
the Excelsior. That vessel was scheduled
to sail from Seattle March 1 for Alaska,
and even four days later she had not ar
rived at Sitka from the westward.

but it has been the experience of the
writer that beginners make better pro
gress by removing the diaphragm from
the lens part before focusing, to be re
placed after the focusing, it would, of
course, be an impossibility to lay down
any Ironclad rule for choosing the stop,
as different subjects will require different
depths of focus. It must be understood
that the diaphragm ia used for two pur
poses. First, to secure greater depth of
focus. The smaller the diaphragm the
greater the depth, or the farther back it
will cut the picture sharp. But the draw
back in making too small a diaphragm
is that It will require a considerable In
crease In exposure.
Â¦ The second consideration !n using the
diaphragm Is that it corrects spherical and
other aberrations that are In the lens.
The chief point to be remembered In us
ing the diaphragm Is to use the largest
possible, for It requires le6s time and the
picture Is better. The smaller the dia
phragm the flatter the field, or, in other
words, the more sameness the picture will
have. It should be the aim to secure as
Perfect perspective or distance as possl
le, and if too small a diaphragm Is used
It will bring the distance into nearly tha
same focus as the foreground, thus cans
ing the flatness spoken of above. About
the simplest rule that could be given for
the choosing of a diaphragm Is to focus
on the central figure or object In the pic
ture with the diaphragm out and then
put In different sizes until the one Is
found that gives the effect of the dis
tance receding gradually until the farth
est distance la of a misty appearance;
but even the distance farthest from the
camera should be distinct enough to show
what It Is composed of. It will be found
that the diaphragms are all numbered
and run in numbers like thinâ xi or xVi
or xIC and so on. These numbers are
only to indicate the size of the diaphragm,
but It Is best not to rely on any number,
but to educate the eye to see all that la
in the picture to be made.
Timing the Exposure.
After the diaphragm has been placed in
the lens a careful examination snoufd ba
made of the object as It appears on i the
ground glass to decide upon the time of
exposure. This Is another point where It
will take experience to become anywhere
near accurate. One method that Is sug
gested for the beginner to follow Is to
look flxedly at the object to be photo
graphed, keeping the eyes as near the
center of It as possible for twenty-five
seconds, and then, without looking at any
thing else, to put the head under the
focusing cloth, examine the image on the
ground glass and count the number of
seconds it takes to see the detail in the
very deepest shadow. Whatever that
number may be will be the time it will
take to get a good negative. However,
some plates require less time than others.
This method Is good if the regular land
scape plates as put out by the different
manufacturers are used.
If It has been decided that a landscape
Is wanted It will require close study to
find out Just what will look well In such
a picture. A bit of scenery which looks
very attractive to the eye may make a
very ordinary picture. When we look at
a view we can see more with the eye than
the lens will take in. The landscape,
should be broken in ltÂ« nature. Over
come "sameness" as much as possible.
Select the bit of scenery that will cause
one to examine the picture closely.
After the view has been decided upon It
is then necessary that the light fall Just
right to bring out what we want to show
to advantage and to cover up those things
which we should like to remain In tha
DIAPHRAGM. SHOTTING RE
VOLVING DISK.
background. As In the case of photo
graphing a building; the sun should never
fall upon the lens. Select a time of day
when the iuq is off to the side and back
of the camera. See that the sky Una Is a
little above the center of the picture. If.
however, the view to be photographed haa
an especially pretty cloud effect It would
be well to drop the line a trifle to secure
the clouds, as they are sure to add to the
beauty of the view. In the choice of a
piece of scenery, tho selection should be
made. If possible, fiom a point where tha
immediate foreground Is of a pleasing na
ture. It is this part of the picture that
will catch the eye of the beholder at the
first glance.
To bring out the perspective better and
to help one judge better of the distance 1c
a landscape it Is advisable so to arrange
the point of view as to have some object
such as a tree, bowlder, stump or some
thing of like nature in the middle fore
ground. Be sure to have It off slightly to
one side of the plate. This will give some
thing by which distance may be measured
with the eye. If there are to be figures
or stock or a house Included In the land
scape these should never occupy the cen
ter of the picture. "Where they come di
rectly In the center they become the "cen
ter of attraction." to the detriment of the
remainder of the picture. .; \
V. â THE FIRST PICTURE.
BY GEORGE W. GILSON.
It Is sometimes almost Impossible to get
just the light that Is wanted. For in
stance, it would be out of the question to
make during the middle of the day a suc
cessful negative of a building facing the
north, for we would be facing or pointing
the lens directly at the sun, which Viould
never be done. In addition to the reflec
tion on the lens we would not be able to
secure the proper amount of definition or
detail In the front of the building. It
would be In shadow, while all the other
surrounding parts would be In strong
light. These parts would be too white for
the front of the building, giving what is
known as too much contrast. In the case
of a house facing the east it would bÂ« bet
ter to make the exposure when the sun
has reached the point where it falls Just
a little off to the side of the front. Of
course. If we have a house to photograph
that Is facing the west tho exposure
should not be made. until after the eun
has passed the meridian far enough to fall
on the side and front. A house facing tho
south is the easiest of all' to handle, as It
can be made either in the morning or aft
ernoon.
For the first trial let us agree that a
house be chosen for the subject. Let us
suppose that the proper light Is now on
the subject. We proceed by setting up
our camera on its tripod. It should bo so
placed as to be perfectly steady. The best
way to secure the most desirable results
and at the same time have the tripod so
that It will not interfere with the move
ments of the operator in focusing Is to sÂ«H
up the tripod so that one leg of it point*
directly toward the object to be photo
graphed. By this means the remaining
two legs will be In such a position that
one may stand between them In arrang
ing the camera.
After the camera Is In position and tho
sort^v of the tripod which holds the cam
era has been tightly set, the cap Is taken
from the lens, the shutter opened by U3lng
the "time exposure," and we are ready to
focus our picture on the ground-glass
screen at the back of the camera.
The opaque focusing cloth Â¦Is then
thrown over the back of the camera and
brought closely down over the head In
such a manner as to shut out all possible
daylight from the back of the camera.
The only light we want is that which
comes thrcugh> the lens at the front.
Focusing is generally done by means of
a screw at the front of the camera, which
racks out or in, as the case may be, thus
increasing or decreasing the distance of
the lens from the screen. This focuses
the ray of light passing from the object
through the lens to the screen, making
the picture clear and distinct upon tha
glass. As the picture becomes sharply
focused upon the screen we notice first
that it Is reversed, or upside down. (The
reason for this is given in the chapter on
lenses.) We soon get accustomed to soelug
our pictures and focusing them in this
upside-down position."
While focusing we have opened the lans
wide, and having now focused the image
on the ground glass as sharply as possi
ble, paying particular attention to a point
about one-third the length of- the plate,
we must make use of the diaphragms, or
stops.
If our camera has a shutter the dia
phragms are fixed In the shutter, and
either represent a revolving disk with dif
ferent sized openings or open and close by
means of little winga pivoted together,
called iris diaphragms.
If the camera has no shutter, what are
termed waterhouse diaphragms are used.
These are sets of metal plates with open-
Ings of different diameters. Any particu
lar plate or diaphragm may be placed in
the H. diaphragm slot which is cut in the
lens for the purpose. ,' *
One reason for selecting a house or
building for a first trial of focusing the
Image correctly on the plate Is to demon
strate the use of the sliding front and the
swing back. If the camera is set up per
fectly leyel we will probably find that we
have quite an expanse of foreground, but
only one-half or three-quarters of the
house (or height) on the ground glass.
This is caused by the house being so
much higher than the camera. If one
could ascend a platform that would place
the camera on a level with the center of
the house this trouble would be avoided,
but this, of course, Is Impossible. â¢ The dif
ficulty is overcome .by having the front of
the camera so that it can be raised or
lowered. There is a thumbscrew on the
side of the front of the camera. This
needs only to be loosened, when the whole
front can be raised to the height required.
The screw should then be tightened, thus
holding the front in place. It sometimes
happens that even by raising the sliding
front to Its greatest height the -. entire
building cannot be focused upon the
ground glass, a portion ofthe upper part
of the building: still being cut off. In this
case we have to resort to lifting the cam
era upwardâ l. c., pointing the lens slight
ly toward the top of the buildingâ as one
of the fundamental, rules of the photo-
MISS MATTIE OVERMAN.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 1118 Broadway, March 8.
OUT of a sea of scandal and shame which seemed bound to overwhelm
her, Mattie Overman, the central figure in the celebrated church trial
of the Rev. Charles O. Brown, onÂ© time pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church of San Francisco, has risen as a leader in reform and
philanthropic work among girls and young women.
Friends of the young woman in Oakland, who have been watching her
rapid advancÂ« in her chosen field of charitable labor, have received news that
gratifies them beyond measure. Miss Overman has attained bucÃ promi
nence that she Is now at the head of the Washington, D. C, branch of the
Florence Crittenton missions, whose rescue work has attained an International
reputation.
Her career has been one of remarkable success and Revivalist Crittenton,
the millionaire founder of the missions, has given the young woman every
opportunity to develop herself as one of the most active workers in, the
country- Her ministrations and labors have, it is claimed, saved scores and
scores of girls from destruction. Her work, undertaken after she sought
refuge from the public gaze in the Crittenton home at Los Angeles, has pros
pered to a remarkable degree, and it has demonstrated her peculiar fitness
for the field of labor she has chosen.
Many of the Incidents which marked her hard path after the trial and con
viction of the Rev. Dr. Brown have never been made public. Driven from
pillar to post, the ostracized woman finally sought shelter at the Southern
California mission. Then came her confession to the Rev. J. K. McLean of
this city. Miss Overman determined to enlist in the band of Crittenton res
cuers. For a time she remained In Los Angeles, and at the outset her mar
velous success speedily attracted attention from those In charge.
Later Mr. Crittenton became directly interested In the newcomer. She was
sent to the Northwest, remaining there for a time, and subsequently Miss
Overman was transferred to Chicago, where she accomplished much g-ood in
the slums and among the fallen sisterhood.
There was need of some such worker as herself at the national capital,
where is located one of the largest branches of this mission work In the
T'nited Slates, and Miss Overman was sent there, where she maintained the
reputation which had preceded her, and under her practical and well-directed
efforts, many a girl has been turned to the right path.
Miss Overman's friends say she was attracted to this field largely by the
suffering ehe endured after the exposure of her relations with Dr. Brown.
They declare that she was denied even the privilege of occupying rooms in
a public hotel at Stockton; that under assumed names she was compelled to
-peek a home far away from a.ll who had known her, and that whenever her
Identity Mas disclosed she was compelled to depart.
Driven to the verge almost of suicide, the helpless and contrite woman
had only two courses left open, and she chose to ask the sheltering protection
of the mission home. Her companion In much of her trouble was Mrs. Mary
F. Tunnell, known as the missing witness in the Brown case. She has taken
up her reslder.ee In Oakland and still keeps In close touch with Miss Over
man In her work among the unfortunate.

Officials' Efforts to Quash Opposition
Meet No Encouragement From
Oakland Employes of the
System.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 8.
From the point of view of the brother
hood employes of the Southern Pacific
Company the situation with relation to
the relief department has assumed a very
unsatisfactory i-haee during the past for
ty-eight hours. On all sides it is now rec
ognized that the railroad officials are en
gaged in an active campaign in an effort
to offset the agitation among the men.
The insurance scheme is said to be one
of the pet plans of President Huntlngton,
and there appears to be unusual desire on
the part of subordinate officials to have
matter* straightened out before Uncle
Collls" arrival next month in San Fran
cisco.
Despite the carefully promulgated assur
ances from headquarters, the men here
feel that they should not relax one whit
In their efforts to make out a strong cÂ»ee
aeainst the relief bureau. The brother
hood* have kept closely to their original
programme of organization, the meetings
of the various orders having been held
this week according to schedule. The en
gineers on Friday evening will consider
â¢what stand to take. It is certain that
Iceland Stanford Division, the local lodge,
will follow in line with the other brother
hoods and s>end a r< presentation to form
part of the general grievance committee.
That there must be a modification of the
rcherne as now presented before the pre.it
majority of workmen interested will iw
*-atisfled Is definitely settled among thÂ«
mÂ«rn The question of deepest import is
to what lengths shall the men go to make
*-ood thplr demands for a chanpe in the
Slan There Feeme to be a general desire
In Oakland railroad circles to make no
xnove until the result of the conference
between the general roanap^r and the
CTlevanee committee Is known. If neces
sary the men will try to lay their objec
tions directly before President Hunting-
There is no doubt that the men feel that
& strike could or.ly bring trouble and dis
tress to them, as well as great loss to the
company. The situation has not reaeh<vl
tuch an acute stage as to warrant them In
conslderingthe feasibility of an organized
walkout. There are, however, many em
ployes who are so seriously concerned In
the fight agalr.st the relief bureau that
H would be no difficult matter to gvt a
large number of men to agree to Etrik* In
case the company gave a flat refusal to
heed any of the men's demands. There sÂ»
a belief prevalent that rather than take
chances on a strike the company will ac
cede to certain modifications.
OPPOSE NEW PLAN.
Meeting of Southern Pacific Em-
ployes in Los Angeles.
LOS AJCGELES. March B.â Employes of
the Southern Pacific in Los Angeles are
bitterly opposing the proposc-i scheme of
insurance. A meeting of over 100 of the
men was held in East Los Angeles, at
which the matter, as outlined In the cir
cular, was discussed. Every one raised a
voice against the measure, while the teree
addresses thai were made received hearty
applause. The more the matter Is dis

the defendant furnished.
graphing of buildings is that the back
part, or ground glass, and consequently
the plate, when placed In position, must
be vertical. We must now use the swing
back. As the camera Is lifted up we must
swing the top of the back of our camera
forward. In this way we are enabled to
get all of the building In our picture, pre
serve the proper lines of the building and
get uniform sharpness of focus. The
swing-back is also used to bring distant
and near objects in a landscape Into focus
at the same time. This Is often necessary
from the fact that the focus is shorter for
objects at a distance, than for those near
the camera. For the distant objects the
lens is moved nearer the ground glass,
while for objects near us the lens must
be moved farther from the ground glass.
The Choice of a Diaphragm.
After the focus has been taken and all
the lines are straight we then decide on
what diaphragm or "stop" should be used.
Some Operators recommend that the
focusing be done with the diaphragm In,

OAKLAND, March B.â William J. Down-

ELECTRIC MOTORMAN
WAS NOT TO BLAME
James McCauley Was Panic Stricken
at the Time He Was Bun
Over.
A verdict of accidental death and no
body blamed was the result of Coroner
Cole's Inquest yesterday into the death of
James McCauley, who was run over by
a streetcar on Folsom .street, between
Twelfth and Thirteenth, last Monday.
McCauley was a laundryman and resided
at 228 Twelfth street. He was 69 years
old and rather feeble.
The testimony was to the effect that
McCauley started to cross the track In
front of the car, which was about forty
feet away. When he stepped between the
rails he looked toward the motorman and
stepped back again. Then he changed his
mind and stepped in front of the moving
car. He was struck and knocked down
before the brakes could be put In opera
tion.
A verdict of suicide was given In the
cape of Henry V. Morey, the old man who
killed himself with carbolic acid last
Tuesday night In his room at 605 Broad
way.

ARCTIC HOSTELRY AS IT WILL APPEAR COMPLETED.
AMONG the many plans for money gathering at Cape Nome none are of
greater magnitude or fairer promise than those outlined In the pros
pectus of the Nuivak Hotel Company, recently organized in this city.
The company Is capitalized for $100,000, and contemplates In the scope
of Its operations nothing less than the acquirement of a monopoly of
the entire hotel business of the mining districts of Northern Alaska.
The head of the new company Is T. C. Healy, who ha 3 long resided In
the Yukon district, and who has made his pile in the same lines at Dawson.
Such success has attended his ventures there that he now contemplates en
larging the sphere of his activity and striving for the business of Nome or
any other mining camp that gives promise of permanency.
The Interest in his present venture arises not so much from the amount
of money involved as from the manner in which the affair will be conducted.
People build and operate hotels every day, but this is the first time that a
first-class hostelry, with every modern appliance, has been built In one place
and shipped nearly 3000 miles In the hold of a vessel to the site upon which
it will stand.
The lumber will be all cut, shaped, fitted and fashioned In California.
Every_detail of necessity and comfort will be constructed and completed here.
When this Is done every plank, beam, shingle, bolt, nail and screw will be
separately marked, and then the entire structure will be taken apart, stowed
away aboard ship and carried to Nome, where it will be unloaded and set
up. In storing the building the upper stories will be loaded on board first,
so that when it Is broken out the foundations will come first, and the car
penters, of whom there will be a number taken up, may begin working on
part of the building while the balance is still being floated ashore.
The magnitude of the undertaking will be appreciated when the follow
ing description of the edifice given by Architect Curtis Tobey Is gone over.
The designs and working plans for the new hotel are about completed
and the work on framing and construction will be begun immediately.
All of the building is to be of frame, even. to the foundation, which will
be formed of cross timbers en pile. Great care had to be exercised to se
cure a permanent base for these foundations owing to the fact that the
ground is perpetually frozen from two to three feet below the surface, and
any thaw would have a tendency to heave the footings unevenly.
The building will be five stories high. Including the attic, with a ground
space of 60x100 feet. The first or ground floor will contain a large office and
lobby, a barber shop, saloon and gentlemen's grill, a ladles' parlor, ladies'
grill, commodious kitchen and wine and store rooms. The bar will be of hard
woods, 34 feet long, and will accommodate four bartenders. At the end and
between the two grills is a raised music stand representing an open shell,
which will hold eight pieces and piano.
The second floor will contain a large central drawing room or reception
hall, opening directly from the main stairs leading from the office and la
dies' parlor. This room Is provided with ample light from a large skylight.
A dumb waiter from the kitchen below affords ample facilities for using the
reception hall for banqueting should the lower rooms be used for public gath
erings. â¢-"'
The balance of the second floor and all of the third, fourth and fifth floors
are devoted exclusively to sleeping apartments, numbering In all 102 rooms.
Each of these rooms Is provided with outside light and double frost-proof
sash, clothes closet, electric light and call bell service. Each floor Is pro
vided with separate lavatories and baths for men and women, linen closets.
Janitors' hoppers and all modern hotel plumbing appliances.
The building will consume in its construction approximately 300,000 feet of
Oregon pine lumber, which will all be framed and marked and bundled up
before shipping from this city. All of the walls, floors and ceilings will be
deadened, and the walls and ceilings sheathed with tongued and grooved
stuff covered with canvas duck painted, to represent rough tinted plastering.
As to the profits that will accrue from the Investment, Mr. Healy fig
ures on from 50 to 73 per cent on the capital employed. He bases these fig
ures on what he has already accomplished with a twenty-room house at
Dawson, and those who know the country Bay. that he ia very conservative
in his estimate. Some idea may be had of the returns from a hotel business
In the far north when It is known that the clear profits from the bar of Mr.
Healy's Dawson house run from $10,000 to $13,000 a month. This does not in
clude the revenue derived from the rent of rooms, grill and other sources.

MARSHALL LAW
LOOKING FOR
A NEW PULPIT
Former Rector of Church
of the Advent Departs
for Oregon.
Vestrymen With Whom the Clergy
man Had a Lively Battle Seek
Information as to His
Whereabouts.
> ' -
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 8.
The Rev. V. Marshall Law, late rector
of the Episcopal Church of the Advent,
has shaken the dust of Oakland from his
feet and has gone to new fields In search
of fresh ministerial experience. The de
parted rector is now looking for a pulpit
In Southern Oregon. His family is wait-
Ing In San Francisco for word of success
or non-success in his efforts to find a new
location.
Hector Law had an up-and-down career
In Oakland, beginning with a summons to
court In a suit of his Chinese laundry
man to recover for services rendered. A
secular constable attached the Sabbath
morning contributions to secure the .claim,
and several other unpleasant financial epi
sodes led the vestry to start a campaign
to oust their clerical leader.
The struggle between the vestry and the
rector disrupted the church temporarily.
John J. Valentine, president of Wells.
Fargo & Co., one of the main stays and
senior warden of the vestry, resigned. The
rector defied the governing body of the
church to evict him from his pulpit.' He
was finally Induced to take a vacation.
From Boston came the welcome news to
the vestry that the rector had found an
other charge. But on the heels of that
announcement came the rector himself,
prepared to resume his pastoral functions.
Much to the surprise of the vestrymen
Dr. Law Insisted upon preaching. In viola
tion, the vestry said, of an agreement
that he would leave the Church of the
Advent forever. And preach he did, al
though the large vested choir went on
strike and refused to furnish music for
the services.
The warfare culminated finally In the
retirement of the rector. He declared that
his troubles were all due to his discourses
on Christian Science, delivered from the
pulpit. To many of the church members
ft seemed as If their rector were making
a defense of the cult, which was repug
nant to the ritualistic worshipers In his
flock. Dr. Law also introduced In his
church what he termed a sanitary com
munion chalice.
Shortly after his resignation the story
was floated among the parishioners that
Dr. Law had leagued himself with the lo
cal organization of Christian Scientists,
but this the rector denied, although ad
mitting he saw much which was com
mendable In their doctrine of "divine heal*
inc."
The vestrymen of the church are mak
ing an effort to learn the whereabouts of
their former rector.

SAN TOMAS IS
A WONDER IN
MUDDY FOOTING
Bolted at the Start, and Then
Finished Close Up at
the Stand.
Three Choices Show in Front at Oak
landâNone Such Beats His
Field Out at Long
Odds.
About the only Incident bordering on
the sensational in connection with the
sport at Oakland track .yesterday was the
phenomenal run made "by San Tomaa in
the opening event. The erratic actor went
to the post favorite . over the other nine
starters, and his behavior was most ex
emplary until a start was accomplished.
Then he bolted toward the outside fence
with Buchanan, looking to be completely
out of. the race. A crack over the head
from his rider's whip straightened him
out again, and running like a scared wolf
he actually finished well up In the bunch.
But for his crankiness the Brutus horst
would have won by himself. As it was,
Espirando, ad to 1 choice, ridden by
Powell, downed Bamboulla a neck.
While only three favorites crossed the
wire first, none of the other winners were
neglected, the 15 to 1 shot None Such es
pecially carrying considerable support.
Very few of the books laid away much
money.
The Pueblo stable's Intrada captured
the two-year-old dash. The filly enjoyed
a decided call in the betting over her
field, and breaking in front was nevei
headed. Buchanan landed On Time in the
place, a couple of lengths ahead of
Socapa. >
A poor start contributed. to ta# defeat
of Essence, 4 to 5 favorite for the mile
selling run. Bullman, who had the leg up,
was apparently asleep when the barrier
went up, getting several lengths the worst
of it. The heavily played Tekla then went
out, winning easily. Essence got up In
time to take the place from Choteau.
None Such, a lS to 1 shot, played to 8,
furnished the surprise in the mile and a
sixteenth run. First away at the start,
he went through the mud like an ice-cut
ter, having speed to loan at the finish.
The hard-ridden favorite Stuttgart lost
the place to Don Luis, the second horse
throughout the running.'
W. L,. Stanfield's Toriblo has developed
into more than a shifty ! selling plater.
Starting a stanch favorite for the second
mile selling run, he raced head and head
with Boundlee to the stretch, when T.
Walsh cut loose, winning in a romp.
Scotch Plaid overtook Boundlee on the
way home, beating Schreiber's colt for the
place. Erwin was never a factor.
It was not such a bad day for the tall
Texas horseman, for the Stanneld colors
were again conspicuous in the final event.
Castake, at odds of o to 2, trailed Miss
Marion to the stretch turn, where he as
sumed the lead, finishing first, seven
lengths in front of Montallade.
Track Notes.
Bullman objected to riding Cyril In the
opening event until ordered to do so by
the Judges, Barney Schreiber having made
the engagement. The horse has bad un
derpinning, and his entry will not be ac
cepted In future at Oakland.
Fred Edwards, trainer of San Tomas,
was requested by the stand to put up a
strong boy In future on his horse.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman, who Is
having- a try at the gamo from the ground,
was fortunate enough to get aboard the
long shot None Such.
It was quite generally supposed that
weight packing was the "long suit" of
Momentum. The horse received strong
backing to win the first number and fin
ished fifth.
There was considerable "kicking" over
the start to the mile run, captured by
Tekla. Bullman had the mount on Es
sence and looked fully as much to blame
as the starter for not getting away.

The reports show that during the year
thirty-one new members were added to
the rolls and that the number of little
wards received at the shelter was greater
than it has ever been. There are now sev
enty-five little ones there, in addition to
a number of day children, who are placed
there during the day while their parents
are -at work and for which service , the
parents pay a small sum. The Income
from the parents of day children was $900
ln ' excess of that received the previous
and that, .with the contributions
from members, supported the shelter. The
expenses during the past year were within
$100 of the amount of expenditures.
Larger accommodations are needed, and
a proposition was discussed to either erect
a suitable building or seek larger quar

for. the little ones, and they will be pleaded
to receive donations |of cast-aside books

Lane's testimony, while he was manag
ing the dining department of the Park
Hotel ln Alameda.
' "I met Fair and a female companion in
room 17 of the hotel." said Lane. "They
sent for me to give an order for their
Â¦upper. I did not know who the .woman
was at the time, and did not learn that
she was known as Mrs. Craven until
many months afterward. The couple
stayed at the hotel for several days. Fair
left before his companion. JuÃt before his
departure he said to me in the presence
of Mrs. Craven, or Mrs. Fair, as I sup
pose she is: 'I am going away now and
I want you to Bee that my wife is, well
taken care of.' I suppose he meant ln
the way of feeding her, of course, as I
had nothing to do with any other depart
ment of the hotel."
, Mr. Pierson put Lane through 'a severe
cross-examination, but did not succeed in
shaking his testimony. The whole pro
ceedings apparently bored the witness, for
he yawned between every answer, until
the Judge became infected with. the "tired
feeling" and almost went to sleep. ' v
During the morning session of the court
Mrs. Hobbose was on the witness stand
for further cross-examination, but no ad

that he had searched through the private
papers of the dead millionaire, but could
find but one letter written to him by Mrs.
Hobbose. He had not succeeded in locat
ing the picture of the Hobbose children
which Mrs. Hobbose had testified she had
sent to him. She identified the letter, but

ALHAMBRA TO REOPEN
WITH A CLEVER FARCE
Sunday afternoon the popular new Al
hambra Theater will reopen with ore of
the newest and brightest farce-comedies
that has been presented to local theater
goers this season. "Have You Seen
Smith?" is the title of the new play, which
will be seen for the first time on the coast
at the Alhambra. coming here direct irura
a very successful tour across the conti
nent. It is a very bright comedy and will
be elaborately rtaged in- the coming pro
duction. The piece is replete with clover
specialties and catchy music, while. a dis
tinctive feature is made of the spectacular
effects. The company Is a strong one and
much more pretentious than Is usually
seen in a farce-comedy. It is headed by
the famous comedian John Tlerney, who is
very favorably known in this city. The
leading lady is May Donohue, who crcatc-d
the original Mis. Murphy in "Chimmle
Fadden."
The advance sale opened yesterday
morning at the Alhambra box-office, and
despite the rain continued brisk.through
out the day. From present indications
there will be crowded houses at both per
formances on Sunday.
Whereas, The Republican
National Committee has is
sued a call for a National Con
vention to be held June 19,
1900, and
Whereas it is the desire of
this, the Republican County
Committee of San Francisco,
that in the organization of the
State Convention for the selec
tion of delegates to the Na
tional Convention the com
plete harmony and best inter
ests of the Republican party
be conserved and fostered,
and furthermore believing
that, to this end, it is neces
sary for the Republican State
Central Committee to take
early action in the matter of
the issuance of its call for a
State convention, it is there
fore by this County Commit
tee
Resolved, That the chair
man of the Republican State
Central Committee be re
quested and is hereby respect
fully urged to call said State
Central Committee together
in meeting on or about the
17th of March of this year,
and that the said State Cen
tral Committee be and is
hereby respectfully requested
to issue at said meeting
or immediately subsequent
thereto its call for the State
convention.
It is further , resolved,
That a copy of these resolu
tions be forwarded at once to
the chairman of the State
Central Committee. v -
A. J. Martin asked the chairman, Alfred
Bouvier, if the records of the Fourth and
Fifth Congressional conventions had been
transmitted by the old County Commit
tee to the existing committee, and J was
Informed that the * documents had not
been secured.
- The secretary read a courteous ! letter
from United States Senator Bard, ac
knowledging receipt of complimentary
resolutions adopted by the committee.
In the regular order of business, A-
Ruefs amendment to the by-laws, pro
viding for increasing the number of the
executive committee from eighteen to
twenty-five and taking the additional five
from commltteemen at large, was called
up. After discussion, the proposed
amendment was rejected.
August Tilden's amendment to increase
the number of members of the advisory
committee from five to ten was also re
jected.
Alex B. Truman moved that the chair
be authorized to appoint the five mem
bers to constitute the advisory commit
tee, as provided for in the existing by
laws, before the next regular meeting.
The motion was carried.
Adrian Smith introduced the following
resolutions:
Whereas, The State primary law doe* not
throw Its valuable safeguards around the com
mon primary elections; now, therefore, be It
Resolved, That .the executive committee of
the Republican County Committee be and here
by Is instructed .to communicate with the
Democratic County Committee of this city and
county to the effect that this county committee
advocates the holding of both Democratic and
Republican primary elections on the same
days, said days to be selected after mutual
conference, and said primary election shall be
under the control and direction of such Demo
cratic and Republican county committees; and
be It further ;
Resolved. That our executive committee be
and hereby Is instructed to communicate with
the Republican committees representing: the
Fourth and Fifth Congressional districts re
questing their co-operation ln effecting such
an arrangement.
In advocating the adoption of the reso
lution Mr. Smith held tnat it was neces
sary that all possible safeguards should
be thrown around the primaries. If pri
mary elections of both parties be held on
the same day Republicans cannot vote for
Democrats and Democrats cannot vote for
Republicans.
' A. Ruef said that he was in favor of
the plan proposed,- but expressed doubt
as to its practical operation. For exam
ple, he remarked. Democrats may not
elect delegates to their National Conven
tion by Congressional districts. ..Again,
he suggested, that the RepuDllcan Con
gressional'district committees might be
Jealous of their rights.
A. J. Martin advised the committee that
care should be taken in sending delegates
to the National Convention. He remark
ed: "We sent two delegates to St. Louis
four years ago because we failed to start
out right."
After further discussion the resolutions
were adopted. If was understood that the
executive committee would take no action
toward conference with the Democrats
until the Republican State Central Com
mittee fixed a time for holding the Repub
lican State Convention.
Mr.lTilden; Introduced a resolution ex
pressing the. sense of. the county.commit
tee that no. member thereof should hold
membership "in any organization or asso
ciation of persons hostile to said commit
tee.
Discussion prolonged and animated en
sued. Messrs. Ruef and Buckley admitted
that they were members of the old coun
ty committee, but declared that they had
not attended a meeting since the new
committee was created.
â¢ Mr. Cox asserted that members of the
old county committee. deserved credit for
voting . for Horace Davis. He remarked
that some of the members of the present
committee who voted for Jim Phelan
wished now that they had voted for Hor
ace Davis. The remark called out a round
of applause. 1
Adrian Smith eaid the talk to the effect
that the old committee claimed the right
to act as the regularly constituted county
committee was all nonsense. So far as he
knew, the old members were going to
stand iln for Republican success.
The suggestion was made by several
speakers that the adoption of the resolu
tions would /produce discord rather than
harmony in . the party, : hence the i subject
matter -.was ; laid on the table and the
meeting adjourned. .'illljgfe^Ss
CARED FOR THE LITTLE ONES.
What the Directors of the Infant
Shelter Are Doing.
HER REMAINS WERE
REDUCED TO ASHES
Before Incineration a Post Mortem
Examination of Miss Wilbur's
Brain Was Made.
Simple and impressive were the funeral
services held over the remains of Mlas
Elida Wilbur yesterday afternoon at the
family residence, 2228 California street.
The home where she had passed her
happy girlhood and where for two long
years she had lain in that profound sleep
was decked with roses and lilies and vio
lets ac for a bridal. There was nothing to
suggest that the dread reaper had made
his appearance.
The snow-white casket that held the
mortal remains of the unfortunate girl
was completely hidden from view with a
pall of violets and pink and white roses.
The family was not present at the ser
vices, and so the usual depressing back
ground of somber-clad figures was wcr.t
lng. Rev. Dr. George C. Adams of the
First Congregational Church read tho
funeral service, and there was Blnginjr by
a quartet, which added to the impresplve
ness of the ceremony.
At 3:30 o'clock a train bearing the re
mains, the relatives of the deceased, Mr.
Dunphy, Miss Dunphy and a few imme
diate friends repaired to Cypress Lawn
Cemetery, where the body was inciner
ated. Six old friends of the family lifted
the casket to the hearse; they were F. B.

SAYS FRAGLEY GOT
HIM TO PAY BILLS
Ex-Superintendent of Streets Defend-;
ant'in a Suit Filed by B. F.
: Tracy.
Ex-Superintendent of Streets Martin J.
Pragley has-been sued by B. F. Tracy
to recover $1818 50, money loaned and un
paid. . In his complaint Tracy alleges
that at divers times within the two years
last â¢ past plaintiff paid to divers persons
divers sums of money, for the .use and
benefit of defendant at defendant's special
Instance and request, amounting to
$1818 50. Just whom the persons . were to
whom the money was paid the complaint
fails to state. Neither does it intimate for
what purposes the money was paid.
Attorney Curran, who is associated with
Stephen O'Keeffe, plaintiff's attorney,
says that Tracy advanced the money to
pay various bills during the recent cam
paign, in which Fragley was a candidate,
and now demands a return. Fragley, he
says, probably claims that as he "took
care" of Tracy after his election the obli
gation was liquidated, but Tracy denies
that any agreement to the effect existed.
PLAGUE FARCE
PLAYS HAVOC
WITH BUSINESS
Many Suffer From Quaran
tine Which Is Maintained
in Chinatown.
Federal Government and Commercial
Houses Lose Thousands of Dol
lars on Account of Board
of Health Embargo.
Enoiigli farcical Incidents mark the bu
bor.ic plague scare generated by our su
premely wise Health Board to furnish
material for a series of microblc comedies.
But the laughable and ridiculous phase
of it has given way to the serious.
Had thÂ«Â» sporadic effort of ,the Health
Department been conceived for the merÂ«
purpose of furnishing amusement and ex
citement or to "hold up" the Supervisors
the public might have passed it by with a
condemnatory shrug of the shoulders, but
the dire effect upon business is another
matter. To continue the fareÂ© the quar
antine woe so far relaxed yesterday as to
allow the streetcars to pass through that
portion pronounced infected. Passengers
werÂ© not permitted to get on or off, how.
ever, between Kearay and Stockton
streets, nor were they permitted to rlda
on tbe dummy between thfse streets.
Rarely does a Chinese show any ebulli
tion of temper, but there are now enough
angry Celestials in Chinatown to fill an
asylum. Hundreds of servants were
caught ln the meshes of the Quarantine,
and they all want to go home. The few
polloe officers m-ho stand guard are not
Ã¼biquitous and escapes and rescues are
Jreqoesc Many a family accustomed to
Its Chinese cook to manipulate the pots
and pans at home yesterday was without
the imported article.
Quarantine No Joke,
Ttila ocaractine Is no JokÂ» to the Chl
atrne merchants, whose business Ik put in
Jeopardy. In order to remove the embargo
Louis Quong will to-day apply to the
United States District Court for a writ of
Injunction restraining the Board of Health
from continuing the embargo in China
town. Consul Ho Vow has caused bulle
tins to be posted in Chinatown reiterating
his announcement of the previous day.
He will also apply to the authorities to
have the quarantine raised.
What effect the embargo has had on
business cannot be determined in an off
hand manner. Few people know of the
great congestion of trade that has fol
lowed the quarantine of the Chinese quar
ter. The action of the Board of Health,
which ordered the quarantine, has in
fringed upon many business concerns and
lost to them many thousands of dollars.
one of the chief sufferers from roped-in
Chinatown is the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. More than fifty Chinese were
booked to sail on the America Maru which
left this port Wednesday. On Tuesday
r-ight they were in Chinatown bidding
Eoodby to their friends and paying their
last respects to their gods. The Maru
sailed without them and the Pacific Mail
Â¦mm* up its traffic loes at no less than
12000. liad the company known that the
llfty odd Chinese were not to eail the
epaee allotted to them would have been
tised for Ireight. which is piling up on the
lianUs of all oriental shippers just at pres
ent.
Revenues Fall Off.
The Federal Government is a great suf
ferer. By the Quarantine of Chinatown
wtween one-fourth and one-third of the
revenues collected at this port have been
cut off and the business at the Custom
house practically stagnated. Three Fed
eral Interpreters who assist In the conduct
or t,hines,e business are locked up within
the sacred jirecincts and business which
needs immediate transaction must be post
poned until the embargo is raised.
At present there are two ships in the
harbor the Warren and the Carlisle City,
laden with goods invoiced to Chinese mer
chants. L'nless the embargo is raised very
soon these goods must be bonded ln ware
houses, entailing additional expense upon
consignor and consignee. Besides this
there are consignments in the Customh
ouse that are ready for delivery- What
the _ c revenue derived from the Chinese
traffic tw-ars to the gross receipts may be
seen from the following report:
Duties in October, 1899. $503.644 66, of
which 1175.8^6 til was paid by Chin*Â»Â«Â«.- jfo

the Board of Health had not answered
Collector Jackson's letter, ln which he
asked whether or not the district had
been declared infected. Until he receives
an answer he will refuse all outgoing
Fhips a clean bill. When these ships
reach their destination they will perforce
be obliped to go into quarantine and un
told needless inconvenience will result
In a Sea of Doubt.
The physicians of the Health Board are
wallowing in a sea of doubt, talking mi
crobes, bacilli, cultures and practicing on
guinea p!rs and rabbits which have been
inoculated with the poison from the
f lands of the dead Chinese found Tues
ay night ln the basement of 1001 Dupont
street. According to Dr. Kellogg, the bac
teriologist of the board, the result will not
be known, until the end of the week. In
the meantime the community may anx
iously juvait the result and study plague
eymptoms simultaneously with the
learned physicians of the Health Board
One condition which tends to generate
disease ln Chinatown more than any
other, perhaps, has been overlooked by
the Board of Health on its dally rounds
through the district. Kver since the In-
Euguratlon of. the blockade the garbage
has not been removed and barrels heaped
with the offensive stuff stand as a menace
to health on every corner. Merchants are
complaining and they fear for a siege of
eerioue Bickness if something Is not done
to better the sanitary conditions.

RASCALS ARE
THE CHILDREN
OF POLITICS
Father Yorke on Man as a
Social Animal and His
Relations.
Social, Business and Political Condi
> tions of tne Present Day Are
Analyzed by the Eminent
Priest.
â¢
"Ye cannotserve God and mammon." Rev.
Father Peter C. Yorke further Impressed
this truth on the minds of a vast congre
gation at St. Mary's Cathedral last even
ing and pointed out to his listeners why
the Lord had spoken and said that It was
"easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven." Father Yorke
confined his address to "Man as a Social
Animal." In part he said:
"There are three relations In the life of
manâ society, business and political. In
Holy Scripture we \ find that the word
â¢world' is applied to man in his three rela
tions, and we must also accept the truth
that between God and the world there
now exists truceless. irreconcilable war.
Let us Bee what it ia in the world that
causes tne Lord to stand against us. Man
in the first place is a social creature. He
must dwell in a community of people.
Loneliness will eat away the heart, and
the closer men are bound together the
moie their wits are polished; the more
urbane they become. From these commu
nities of men reason makes plain to us the
three relations that make up his life, and
we find that each are for bodily good
alone. No government or condition among
men has as its object the control of the
mind, the soul and the spirit of man. It
is the idea of our Government that man
should give up as little of his personal
liberty as possible; to steer the ship of
state as close to the breakers of anarchy
as is commensurate with safety. We give
our courts, our officers and politicians as
little power as possible, and a fundamental
principle of our constitution gives to all
the right to be free, to follow their, own
ideals and objects of happiness so long as
a like pursuit of others is not interfered
with. All of this is for the bodily welfare
of man. which is the object of ail society,
of all government.'
Â¦ "In my opinion nothing is more charm
ing than a politician clothed in his white
robes of candidacy. How he greets his
friends and the passing stranger and tells
them of the good that he can do, but when
the votes, have been, counted and he is
given his certificate of election he counts
those he greeted with glad smile before
among the trying annoyances of office
When he is ready to leave for private life
again his immaculate. gown 01 candidacy
is spotted and torn like those which have
been spread in the market place since we
were old enough to. vote.- It is great to
enter on a plan of political purification
but as a rule the man who is blinded with
the prospect of a political Job will drive a
coach and four through the ten com
mandments,-but'all must answer unto'
God. Our political liberty consists in the
right to throw one crowd of rascals out
of office and put another crowd of rascals
in, or if, rascals are not put in it is safe
to say that they will go out rascals. 'But
I say to you again. Tfe cannot serve God
and mammon. "
