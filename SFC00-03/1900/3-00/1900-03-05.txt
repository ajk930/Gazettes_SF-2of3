T"\ORDRECHT, Cape Colony, March 4â General Brabant's colonial d;
\J vision, after a night march, is now attacking the. Boers in: a strong
position. at Labuschagnes Nek, on tha road from Dordrecht to James-,
town. The engagement is proceeding with great vigor and th > Boers are
gradually retiring before the British shell fire from threes -positions. *A
heavy rifle fire is being exchanged where, the British are engaging the
Boers on the right flank. So far the Beers have had no big guns'] in.
Eveningâ General Brabant's advance, to-day was' most .satisfactory.
After marchingr and bivouacking overnight the force reached the;strongly
intrenched positions which they occupied andÂ»n6w;hold,' the.Boers being,
on the opposite hill. The British will remain tc-nightin/the captured
positions, although the Boers brought .two guris .into' action]' and. made
determined efforts to retake them. The British losses are six killed. and
eighteen wounded. . . -"" '*

LOXDOX. March 5.â The
long period of idleness in
Northern Cape Colony is at
an end. The British are ad
vancing and the Boers are re
treating ail along the line. Boers
retreating from Colesberg are be
ing followed up rapidly. General
Clements is now at Achtertang,
the last station but one before
Xqrvals Pont. The British are
trying to seize the Bloemfontein-
Xorvals Pont Railway, when the
Boers Li the southeast and
southwest of the Free State
would be cut off frohfthe main
body at Winburg.
There has been "fighting at
Labuschagnes Xek between Gen
eral Brabant and the Boers. The
nek was captured, but the Boer
force proved larger than had
been anticipated. The British
did not score any success.
Lord Roberts and Lord Kitch
ener have returned to Osfontein.
The Boers are now* ' within five
miles of the British position, but
.there is no intelligence at hand
regarding the British comman
rler-in-cbiefs intentions or move
ments. Reinforcements are ar
riving daily, so that he must have
between 50,000 and 60,000 men,
if not more. The force in. Natal
numbers 40,000 and there are
50,000 elsewhere in Cape Colony.
The Boer force now, of all arms,
is placed by good judges at 5,000
men, but it is still much scattered.
The force facing Roberts prob
ably consists of local comman
dos and* the first detachments
sent to Cronje's help.
At Ladvsmith Generals Buller
and White are busy carrying out
the changes rendered necessary
by the removal from Ladysmith
of the garrison* so soon as fresh
troops take their place and the
sanitation of camp is accom
plished. There has been a skir
mish at Besters, half way between
Ladysmith and Van Reenans
Pass, which shows that mounted
men are following up the retreat
ing Free Staters.
The inactivity of Ladysmith
garrison and its failure to co-ope
rate with Buller is now explained.
General White's . troops are so
exhausted from want of food that
the men could not march two
miles. Artillery endeavored to
harass the retreating Boers, but
could not get near enough to
them to inflict any damage. The
Boers' big 5.9-inch. gim on Bul
wana Hill, it is reported, has
been captured by the British. At
tempts had been made by the
Boers to remove it after the^ar
rival of Dundonald's force, but
they were defeated by the last of
the few shells which remained to
the naval guns at Ladysmith.

STRONG OPPOSITION
TO THE MEAT BILL
Resolutions Adopted by the Execu
tive Committee of the German
Commercial Convention.
BERLIN. March 4.â Regarding the re
port eabJed from Washington that Secre
tary Hay had received- assurance from
the German Government that the meat
bill would be changed. United States Em
bassador White said to-day that he had
no Information to confirm it, but he ex
pected this assurance would be given. -
The executive committee of the German
Commercial Convention yesterday'adopted
unanimously a resolution against â¢ the
committee report .on the meat bill, de
claring that such -a prohibition of meat
imports would considerably injure meat
consumption on the part of a'large'sec
tion of the nation, particularly the - in
dustrial masses. The protest concludes
as follows: Â¦;..?.-* - ;
"We protest on behalf of the industries,
of tbe commerce and shipping of the Ger
man fatherland." ; ; , - , Â»Â¦*. ' Â¦ 'Â¦-
The influential Weser Zeltung â¢ points
out forcibly that the meat imports, at a
conservative estimate, amount to only
50.000.000 marks, whereas the exports to
the United States reach 365.000.000 marks,
all of which would be threatened by the
prohiliJtion of the bill. It says:
"A tariff war would make the British
and the Belgian successors to the Ger
man trade wltn the United. States. More
over, the Americans Â¦ themselves '-would
develop those industries which , Germany
now supplies." Â¦ â¢ â¢ "

Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, March 4.â
Legislation providing for the construction
of a sutwnarine telegraph cable connecting
the, United States with Hawaii, Guam, the
Philippiist-s, China and Japan is one of the
projects; which the Republican leaders
propose to carry through the present Con
gress. It UÂ»* probable that with the pres
sure of ocher important business this
measure may go over until next session,
but bills will be tavorably reported in both,
houses during the present session.
There are tew men in either house who
are opposed to the construction of the
proposed cable. The only difference of
opinion is as to the jnanner in which it
should be done. Bills have been intro
duced in both houses providing for the
construction of tha cable directly by the
Government, and these have been stnontrly
urged by Brigadier General Greely, cliief
of the signal corps. By the Navy Depart
ment and by other departments of the
Government, Other bills have bÂ«en "intro
duced providing for tJie construction .of a
cable by a private corporation and for the
payment of an annual subsidy by the Gov
ernment in return for the free trasmlsslon
of all Government mtssages.
In the Senate theee bills have been re
ferred to the Committee on Xaval Af
fairs, and in the Hocse they are before,
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce. Hearings have been given by
both committees to officials of the Gov
ernment and to representatives of various
companies seeking authority to lay the
cable.
The House committee has already jjone
so far as to decide by a. majority vote in
favor of the conÃtructiatn by a private
company rather than by the Government.
It has also been decided tJiat the franchise
shall be open to competition and shall be
awarded to the company offering 1 to take
the lowest subsidy withm the limit of
$400,000 per year for twenty years, and
puaranteeinp the completion or the iable
within the shortest limit* of time. ' The
committee has also derided to. provide
that the cable shall be of American manu
facture and that it shall be laid by> ships
of American register and flying the Amer
ican flag.

NEW YORK, March 4.â Although Pres
ident McKlnley waa up late last night at
tending-the banquet of the Ohio' Society,
he arose about 8 o'clock this morning.
Later, accompanied by his brother Ab
ner and Secretary Cortelyou, he attend
ed morning services at the Fifth-avenue
Presbyterian Church.. Quite a crowd
gathered on the avenue after the service
and greeted .the President and his party
with vigorous handclapping.
The remained in the > hotel
until about 4 o'clock, when he went out
for a drive with Mr. Hawk, proprietor of
the hotel. They went up Fifth avenue,
through Central Park and Riverside
drive. -Â¦ . . -. -
Mrs. McKinley remained at the hotel
all afternoon receiving callers. . Some of
those who called were former Governor
and Mrs. Morton and Misses Morton,
General Anson McCook and United States
District Attorney Burnett. ' â¢
At 10 o'clock the President Â¦ and Mrs.
McKlnley and party left the hotel on the
way to Jersey City, where the President
and his wife took the train, leaving at 12
o'clock.
"I enjoyed my trip immensely: I ' am
enjoying perfect health," the President
said a3 he left the hotel.
Part of the sermon of Bishop Andrews
to-day to which President McKinley lis
tened has been pointed to as a criticism of
the President's Philippine policy. Bishop
Andrews discoursed on charity and love,
taking as his text the fifth verse of the
lirst chapter of the first epistle to Timo
thy: "Now the end of the commandment
is charity out .of a pure heart and of a
good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."
"Whatever may be the reason of de
pravity." said Bishop Andrews, "what
ever may be the doctrine of depravity,
man loves his family, his- neighbors and
his country. This love makes society pos
sible. We should, love our friends and
neighbors and country, but we should love
the people of every other race as we love
ourselves. What is patriotism but a nar
row care of one's own land and city, such
as the Romans had; when they trampled'
out the lives of whole nations? 'Â¦Â¦..-.Â¦< .>-Â¦
"There are indications of a tendency not
to value men of other "races as we value
those of our own.v We cannot recognize
the excellence of the man 'with' almond
eyes, or whose hair is curled a little too
much. We find it hard to recognize that
these are all children of' one, great
Father." ' â¢ : . ?--._Â¦

Correspondence of the , Associated^ Press. ..*..
STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Feb. 12.â As was !
cabled at the time, a representative of. the"!
Associated Press was. recently accorded;
an audience with King Oscar, of Sweden,
and Norway.. The following details of- the
interview are Interesting:
The correspondent arrived at the royal
palace' at 10 o'clock in the morning.
Mounting five nights of. stairs, he entered
an ante-chamber, where one non-commis-
sioned officer from each of the, regiments
of the Life Guards stood at attention.
Several lackeys helped the correspondent
to take off his overcoat! He kept his hat,
as it is the custom to carry it in the hand
when admitted to -the presence of; the
King. In the next room the correspondent |
was. received by the King's L adjutant.-
After a short conversation Â¦he took" the
correspondent into another room, a. grand
salon, one of the most beautiful and gor
geous rooms in the palace. There- the ad>
jutant introduced the correspondent to the
Chamberlain, who thereupon went into"
the King's private rooms. Returning in a
minute ne told the visitor the King was
ready to receive him.
King Oscar was standing in the center
of the room, dressed in the uniform, of a'
general of the Swedish army. ; His Ma
jesty is more than six feet tail. His face
nas an expression of -sympathy, and intel
ligence. From his sprigntly movements
one would never dream that he is a man
of 71 years. The King advanced a few
steps toward the correspondent, extended
his hand and bade him welcome to Stock
holm. His Majesty was very much inter
ested in hearing about conditions In Amer
ica. Nothing mat has hapened there has
escaped, him. He spoke- of the feud In
Kentucky and about the educational; in
stitutions with, the same knowledge, of
facts. He regretted very much to hear
of the death of General Lawton In the
Philippines, showed a great interest- in
what Was taking place on the islands and
asked many questions in regard to. tho
progreeÃ of the campaign.
Naturally the King w-.m much concerned
about the war in South Africa. It must
be remembered that Graat Britain, though
in nowise sui ally of Sweden and Norway,
is the best guarantee for the independence
of the I two northern countries. . â¢ Great
Britain's power once broken it would not
be long before' the little nations would be
swallowed up by their mighty neignbors,
in the East. â¢.
From King Oscar's conversation the cor
respondent believed his Majesty," was in
favor of " the British in Soutn Africa.
However, he spoke in the highest terms
of the great strategic ability of the Boers
and expressed a fervenfwlsh that war In
the -Philippines and "the Transvaal war
would soon be over.
â¢ As to the internal troubles of his two
countries, the King naturally would not
speak for publication. Toward the end of
the audience the King took the corre
spondent into his private writing room,
selected t a splendid , likeness of himself,
said it was the best portrait of him and
wrote his name across it and asked the
correspondent to keep it as a memento of
the audience. i .: Â¦-.-.
The King then sent through the Asso
ciated Press the greeting to the Scandina
vians of the United States which was con
tained in the cable dispatch.
i A few days later the correspondent was
received by the new Minister; of Foreign
Affairs, Mr. Lagerheirn, who in the course
of a conversation " talked of the troubles
between Sweden and Norway. He said, in
part:-- â¢Â¦ -. Â¦ - -_... ?-. Â¦ ? ' .. .Â¦. - ... '
"I think both countries might meet each
other half way on many of their differ
ences and thus by mutual concessions
take* away the bitter feeling that exists
in; some respects.. You doubtless know
that in several instances, as. for example,
to the nationality of the Minister of For
eign Affairs, Sweden has made concessions,
but I repeat all concessions must not come
from one quarter." â¢ Â¦ :-. \-Â¦ ? â¢..Â¦
Mr. Lagerhelm said he was sure that
most of the talk of unfriendliness between
the two peoples was only on the surface,
if even there, adding that If the time ever
came when It would be necessary to make
a common stand in defense of the union
he had . no doubt that the .world .would
find the ' Swedes and Norwegians united
as one. -._Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢:Â¦Â¦ ..Â¦-,-, ;.-. â¢: - .;Â¦.-.;;. , ,â¢-,Â¦-Â¦..,,...,

which Â©vent" was celebrated to-night at
ih^, Academy, of Music by the combined
OJan-na-Gael organizations of the city,
XV. fÃourke Cockran bitterly denounced
the attitude of the administration at
Washington toward England in her af
fairs In South Africa. Ha said in part:
j England sreks to .some extent to Justify this
war by our exampleâ the example set by this
'Government, not by' the people. Now, it Is
'said again, thmt the peoyl* of this country must
remain neutraj. That Is as it should twÂ». But I
deny that this country haa been neutral. There
was. long, befoite this war in South Africa be
gan, a question . between . England and the
United States regarding the Alaskan boundary.
There was a claim- pending. I don't say that
the moment this, war began In South Africa
we should have made a claim against England,
but I do say that the advancement of a claim
, should not have been delayed' one moment.
I WÂ« ceased |at tbat 'Â¦ time to be neutral, j If
the United States administration had gone on
enforcing . that claim this war would â¢ never
have been begun. The'Canadlan troops would
have had abundant business at home. ! Â¦-Â¦.'.
In his. speech last night, "President McKlnley

temptation and crime, all under the guise
of legitimate racing. Dr.' Ford said:
"I. am' very much opposed to our clty
entering into partnership with any kind
of crime. There is no question that the
Ingleside' racetrack and the poolrooms
are great evils, and when this city at
tempts to make revenue out of the crime
breeding spots it is particeps criminls.
When the old Board of Supervisors closed
the track its action met with the appro
bation of the . entire city, and the new
board will fly in the race of the better
element of this city if it nullifies the work
of Its predecessors.
"The fact that certain men have In
vested capital in this vice-breeding evil
does not enter into a consideration of the
matter. It Is a question of whether it is
right or wrong, or whether it is for the
best interests of this city to reopen the
racetrack. Ingleside has ruined more
young men than all the poolrooms of this
city combined.
."To open one and close the other is not
remedying the gambling evil. Both should
be closed and temptation kept out of our
midst. I am very much In sympathy
with any paper or public organ that will
oppose such evils.".
COMMUNITY IS
ENDANGERED BY
THE RACETRACK
IN a prelude to his sermon last evening
Rev. H. T. Shepard, pastor, of Olivet
Congregational Church, spoke strongly
against the reopening of Ingleside
racetrack. His attack on the "hydra-
gaged in, he denounced the racetrack and
the poolrooms. He 'points out the danger
to our. growing: youth, and adds hla ap
peal to the members of the Board of Su
pervisors to keep closed the' infamous si.ot
that has brought ruin to hundreds of both
sexes. Dr. Stephens is unalterably op
posed to the reopening of Ingleside, arid
when he speak 3 against the evil he voices
the opinion of his whole congregation,
which is composed of the most Influential
citizens of this city. He said:
"When the late Board of Supervisor*
voted almost unanimously to . close the
racetrack and the Mayor at once attached
his signature to the ordinance the moral
element of the population most hearttiy
approved. Nothing has since occurred to
reverse the Judgment of those who think
the public morality should be the first
consideration of our municipal Â¦ authoi-J
tles. Horseracing is conducted now just
as it was then, and all its evils still re
main. The racetrack people depend upon
the profits of gambling to keep the- s:>
called sport alive, and any institution tbat
can only exist on the proceeds of ' vice
ought never to be legitimized, and will not
be with the consent of people that have
a sense of Christian morality. The clos
ing of the poolrooms should be effected
without reference to the racetrack. There
is no superfluous merit in this to justify
the contemplated evil. To permit either
one is to compromise with the devil.
"San Francisco has nothing to do with
Tanforan or the Oakland track. San M:j
teo County and the people across the bay
are responsible for them. If they wish to
incur the guilt of condoning such an cf
fense we ought as a city to be self-re
specting enough to refuse to follow their
bad example. One 'can hardly see what
multiplied? This question was decide! nnÂ»
year ago. and that decision has justified
itself before the public. Who are th.">s"
who demand a reversal of this decision?
Are they parents anxious for their boy.--;
teachers and guardians of public mornls;
business men engaged in honest traffic?
Do these classes unite in the prayer that
poolrooms should be licensed and gam
bling legalized?
"Our honored Mayor has done and said
much for which our city gives him praise.
The people will not soon forget those
words in one of his messages: . "Pubilc
gambling is a great evil, leading to pov
erty, disgrace, degradation and death,
which the rocords of this city abundantly
prove, and its practice should be discoun
tenanced and suppressed.' Under our new
city charter the people have been prom
ised and they expect honest, decent gov
ernment. Surely our Supervisors will not
trample tho message of the Mayor jr;der
foot, disregard the wishes of the people,
reverse the action of their predecessors
and commence the boastful reforms of ad
ministration by legalizing public gam
bling." Â£,
TOO MANY LIVES
ARE RUINED BY
CORRUPT EVILS
REV. JOHN STEPHENS, pastor of
Simpson Memorial Episcopal Church,
does not mince words in diicugs'.ns;
the racetrack evil, that should bo
and must be. suppressed. Like every other
member of the sacred calling he is on-
i ; . . . :Â¦â¢Â¦:. -
i ring address to his congregation on tho
subject last night, and at the clos=e of thu
services prominent members of his con
gregation congratulated him on the str.n-1
he has taken. The sermon was a preludo
to his regular Sunday evening address,
and the subject of the discussion was:
"Shall Public Gambling be Legalized?" He
said in part:
"Let the good people of San Francisco
take notice that to-morrow the Super
visors of our city will probably decide
whether public gambling shall be :Â«;Bai
ized. They are to face the question,
'Shall the speeding of horses be so con
ducted that respectable people may htrve
part in and patronize it, or shall such
events be under the control of profession
al gamblers with all debauching associa
tions? ..-.â¢
"It is claimed that the owners of the
racetrack have made large investment 1 ? in
it, and that without the gains of pool
selling these investments will be unproiit
able. But Is it the duty of our city to
guarantee profits on all investments? This
is not done for those who are engaged i.i
legitimate business. Shall it be done for
i those who take the earnings of others
' without giving an equivalent, who corrupt
the morals of society, ruin the lives of our
young men and gather to our city a hor.ie
i of professional criminals?
"Which Is the greater evil, that a ri?b
association which in the past has made,
fabulous profits should make less in the
future by doing a legitimate business, or
that our city should be made the gather
ing place of professional criminals and
gamblers, public morality, be debauched,
homes destroyed, families broken up. our
boys and young men be unlitted for busi
ness, trained in a school of dishonesty,
and the number of criminals and suicides
headed monster" was a violent one and
vrill certainly have weight with the Su
pervisors when they consider the impor
tant question of reopening or forever clos
ing the nefarious resort. In speaking on
the subject Dr. Shepard tn part said:
"Surely there is no valid reason why tha
hydra-headed monster of Jngleslde should
be permitted to unroll his ungainly length
again 'within the confines of our fair
suburbs. It is inconceivable that an hon
est Board of Supervisors â¢ would sanction
the opening of this track. Gambling in all
Its forms Is dishonest and the power for
evil of a great racecourse is alarmingly
increased by the proximity of a great city.
I am eternally opposed to this hell ot
fraud and destruction.
"I would as soon think of defending
theft, prostitution, suicide and murder as
of resuscitating this inquiry. I am heart
ily in favor of athletics and of moral
sports, but when extortion- and vice In h.
thousand forms have become Inseparable
parasites upon the body of stock breeding
and amusement every friend of our city
must say in the name of our day of rest
and of the peace and purity of our homes
that this leviathan of crime haa too few
redeeming qualities to live. I have too
much confidence in our Supervisors and
in our Mayor to believe that they will be
tray their trusts."
CONSIDERS THE
RACE TRACK A
FESTERING SORE
rj^HE congregation of tho Memorial
I Presbyterian Ohurch. which la located
on Eighteenth street, near Railroad
avenue. South San Francisco, has
been apprised by its pastor, the Rev. Her
bert X. Bevier. of the attempt beinsj mads
by unscrupulous men to reopen the Ingle
side racetrack. Dr. Bevier has raised his
voice in the past and denounced the cor
rupting influences of this city and ones
more he has spoken from his pulpit In nÂ»
uncertain terms against the racetrack
and the poolroom evil 3. In an address de
livered yesterday on the subject he said
in part:
"So words can be too strong to express
the sense of outraged decency that arises
in every honest and pure mind over tha
proposal to permit by municipal sanction
another season ot racetrack gambling.
Ingleside was once a festering sore and
once was removed by legal surgery, and
now it Is proposed to relnoculate the city
suburbs with its poison virus. Let us
have none of it; lei the same enlivened
conscience that halted the polygamlst at
the door of our national Congress stop this
great evil from pouring into our city pre
cincts; let the public virtue arise. Gam
bling is an evil and only an evil, and
racing when It leagues itself with, crlmÂ«
becomes partlceps crimfnls, and so equa'
ly guilty. Let our Board of Supervisors
hesitate before they open the flood gates
of iniquity which municipal righteousness
has once closed. Public office is a public
trust. He is false to that trust who fears
to forbid the bans when such unholy alli
ances are proposed as licensed iniquity;
and legalized crime.
"Gambling Is one of the worst of evils â
it is a sucking whirlpool of the most dan
gerous vices. It has wrecked thousands
of precious lives and starved the regis
tration rolls of scores of our best citizens.
It is right that the press should take up
the battle. It is true and loyal so. to do;
it is untrue and disloyal not so to do.
"All honor to The Call for its fine fight.
The ministry la back of and will atand
with it to the end."
EVIL INFLUENCES
OF RACETRACK
LEAD TO RUIN
THE Los Angeles Record, referrins
editorially to the racetrack evil,
*ays: *:â¢Â¦;
The temptations of thÂ« racetrack hayÂ»
driven two morÂ» victims to ruin. The Saa
F*ranclsco Emporium, one of the largest general
stores In the State, has discovered, when It Is
too late, that absolutely no confidence la to
be placed In employes that patronizs- the race
courses.
The criminal records o* San Francisco durlns
the last five years show that hundreds of hon
est young fellows have taken the first step on
the road to ruin at the track. Confidential
clerks have embezzled money, trusted city of
ficials have robbed the city, wives and families
have starved while the head of the family
ruined himself both In body and mind at the
races, in more than one 'case It has beta
strongly suspected that the evil Influence* of
the racetrack have led to- murder. For years
It has been an axiom In San Francisco news
paper offices that every great crime committed
within a certain radius of the city had what
Is known as a "racetrack end." The situation,
became so critical that the beads of business
houxes paid regular salaries to private detec
tives to watch their employes. And yet the
racetrack was allowed to flourish and added
every week to Its list of victims. The races,
with their gambling adjuncts, seem to have a
marvelous power in dulling the moral sens*
of those who patronize them.
No community has a right to lead the weak
Into temptation, no government has a right to
wink at the existence of agencies for the pro
motion of crime. But the authorities in Saa
Francisco apparently wouH rather see tha
young men and often the young women of their
city ruined In body and soul than lift their
fingers against the powerful Interests that con
trol the money-yielding racetracks. If It had
not been for the racetrack. â¢ the Emporium em

APPLAUSE FOR
REAL MELODRAMA
THERE was another eruption of melo
drama'at. the California yesterday
afternoon. "In Darkest' Russia" is a :
mass of megaphone heroics, siren
sentiment and situations of. the "sample
copy"; kind that .are, usually capped .by
tho legend, "continued In our next.'.'
Nothing like' it has been seen Binee r the
palmy days of the blood-sponge drama
when it flourished on Mission street.
Defiant : virtue and discomfited villainy
abound and arouse the hysterical, sympa T
thies of the sentimental enthusiast to
deeds "of handy work and floor thumping
that surpass in' sustention and fervor any
display of approval that, l can recall.'
Judged from the applause, Vln Darkest
Russia" is a. success. The multitude of
trite s sentiments and bits of- bait .in.-the
form of soul-claiming climaxes gave the
audience, which responded clamorously to
each and all, a severe- afternoon's exer-"
else. -The muscular energy expended in
consistently applauding a four-act melor
drama should offer a field of research for
statisticians of physical force.
But agaln-.I say, in view. or in hearing
of the applause, "In ; Darkest Russia" ;is
a success. It was so voted by acclama
tion yesterday afternoon. The villains
(there arc several) were. behissed and the
heroes and heroines (there are several of
these also) were cheered wildly. (Line after

CITY FATHERS
ARE WARNED BY
REV. F. S. FORD
REV. F. S. FORD of the First Chris
tian Church strongly believes that
â¢ no better way of cleansing the city
of evils and temptations is to be
found than in closing the poolrooms and
preventing the reopening of the Ingleside
racecourse. ' He warns the newly elected
Board of Supervisors that by reopening
the track they will fly in the Â£ace of the
better element of the city; that the citi
zens approved of the action of the old
board when It passed resolutions closing
that den of vice, and if the city fathers
do not wish to place a blot on Â» their es
cutcheons at the very outset of their'ca
reers they, must down the measure which
will be Introduced for the purpose of en
riching the treasury with a revenue of
$4000 for forty- days of heart-breaking.
DECENCY BACKED BY PUBLIC OPINION
WILL WIN TO-DAY AGAINST INGLESIDE
THE .SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 5, 1900.
THE Supervisors will decide to-day
whether or not San Francisco is
to be given over to the gamblers
of Ingleside. The issue is of
vital importance to the people of the
city. Realizing the danger and eager
that nothing shall be left undone to pre
vent the consummation of the outrage,
some of the most prominent of local
ministers entered their pulpits to pr<x est
spin yesterday against the scheme of
the racecourse sharpers. These clergy
men knew well the vast injury which
has been worked in San Francisco by
this evil, and they called upon their con
gregations to exercise every endeavor
of persuasion and entreaty upon the
Supervisors not to permit the reopening
of the track and a revival of its crimes.
The Call is in a position to announce
that the battle for decency is almost
won. It knows that there are enough
men in the Board of Supervisors with
sufficient respect for morality to vote
down the proposition to flood the city
with crime through the open gates of
Ingleside. Notwithstanding this assur
ance, the people should not relinquish
their efforts to down this menace once
and for all. Let them appear to-day
before the Supervisors, protesting by
voice and presence against the consum
mation of an infamy. They will carry
the day beyond peradventure.
DR. MACKENZIE
DELIVERS SOME
SOUND ADVICE
NO minister in San Francisco has a
wider knowledge of the dangers
that beset the coming generation
than the Rev. Robert Mackenzie.
D.D.. pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church. For the past two score years he
has preached to thousands, and during his
long career in this city he has watched
Us growth and tainted out the dangers
that besot its path. His advice has often
been heeded in the past and will surely
be heeded at this time, when another
great evil is pending.
In his sermon last night Dr. Mackenzie
made allusion to the racetrack and pool
rooms of this city, and when he said
"election to public office does not neces
eartly commit men to the baser side of
lifÂ© or remove them from the require
ments of the moral law," his congrega
tion knew that he was alluding to the
Board of Supervisors, in whose keeping
the welfare of the municipality had been
given by the citizens of San Francisco. In
part he said:
"That our children come into the world
with pure minds may be admitted; that
The influences of the home aim to main
tain that purity of mind is also admitted:
that a hundred corrupting influences are
in the social atmosphere of our commun
ity, seeking to pervert and "rostitute that
purity to their own selfish ends Is not de
nied. Our community is not alone in this.
It but shares the perils incident to all
large cities.
"Our particular temptation is to he too
Indulgent toward these influences or too
Indifferent in protecting our youth from
power. We cannot prevent the birds from
flying over our heads, but we can prevent
them from building nests in our hair.
Th^re are hardened old victims whose
\rry fond this vice is. If the means of
vice were removed they would follow it.
But there are thousands of young hearts
yearly coming to our city, the hope, or de
spair of its future, who have not yet
learned the nrst evil lesson. As that gen
eration is to-day this city will be to-mor
row. The. intent and desire of this com
munity is. on the whole, on the moral side
of that army of youth. What illicit evils
prevail, exist in spite of this moral ele
ment. They exist in contempt of public
conscience, public morals and public opin
ion. If our governing bodies know their
constituency: if they have any regard
whatever for their opinions and wishes
they will at least prevent the increase of
opportunities for vice, even if they do not
lessen those now existing. It Is a simple
question of fair deal in respect to the
actual moral intent of otir people.
"Why should we not be as fairly dealt
by In politics as we are in all other
epneres of influence? Election to public
efflce does not necessarily commit men to
the baser side of life or remove them
from the requirements of moral law. We
surely can appeal to them as still the
fair-minded, honorable men they were be
fore election, and we do so appeal. We
sre Blow to think that the appeal of rea
fon la of. less effect than the agitation of
passion. The end aimed at will come one
way or the other."

THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION.
TRADE conditions continue about as previously
reported. Last year's boom has finally disap
peared below the commercial horizon, and in
it. :-tead we have easy and halting markets through
cm, the country. The nation has woke up to the fact
that the enormous production of 1899 has finally
caught up with the consumption, and in some lines
is now running ahead of it. The public has also dis
covered that prices for many commodities are too
high, and buying has fallen off in consequence. In
f;.ct, as remarked last week, the rush is over.
This is reflected by the decrease in bank clearings,
which fell off 20 per cent last week, as compared
with the corresponding week in 1899. The same curi
ous condition still prevails in these clearings â i. c.,
that it is the largest ten cities which show the most
loss in the volume of business. The failures last week
were 222, against 188 last year, and were most numer
ous in the Middle and Northwestern States.
In spite of this unfavorable showing, however,
there are no signs of seriously hard times. The lull in
trade simply means that during the past year and a half
we turned out an enormous quantity of goods which
the public, flush of money, bought furiously until the
expected halt. This is that halt. There is no longer
sny scarcity in anything, and the closing down of
mills and factories here and there shows that we will
have to consume present supplies before turning out
more. This has a tendency to weaken prices, which
are lower in some lines, notably hides and leather,
boots and shoes, wool, some kinds of iron and. steel,
etc. The hide market shows especial depression, the
r.i.rket being oversupplied and very dull. Wheat
continues to disappoint everybody in the trade and
ie about the weakest and dullest commodity in the
commercial list, considering its importance. Nothing
seems to have any effect on the slow and sure decline,
which is general throughout the' world. The only
important staple to show any ~ strength is cotton,
which is having a little boom all by itself, much to
the benefit of the Southern States. .
The situation in Wall street is unsatisfactory. All
sorts of bait, from increased railroad earnings to Brit
ish successes in South Africa, have been held out to
tempt the public, but to no avail; the public can
not be induced to enter the market, so the profes
sionals have it all to themselves. The industrial
stocks were soft all the week, with evidences of un
loading by several long pools. The railroad stocks
showed as much strength as any securities, but even
they were listless. Â¦ - .
The weather is beginning to cut some figure in
California. The southern half of the State continues
dry. and unless sufficient rain comes pretty soon there
will be a partial crop failure in that section. The
northern half of the State is all right and will con
tinue so with an occasional shower from now on.
There is a drought in Arizona, which is causing drafts
on this State for sundry lines of produce, and the
San Francisco markets for these goods are showing
rather more firmness in consequence. The early and
open spring lias thus far caused no damage to any
thing, and there have been no frosts to injure the
blossoming fruit. Farm work is well up to datc^ and
the crop outlook in the northern half of the State is
flattering. The merchandise markets are quieter than
for some time, but the outward movement of goods is
very fair, and but few complaints are heard among
the merchants.
A CENSUS TANGLE.
BY reason of the vast cost of the census of 1890,
the many inaccuracies it contained, and .the,
long time required to digest it and publish it,
a radical change will be niadc in taking the census
of this year. It will be simpler, and will not under
take to cover many of the points upon which efforts
v.ere made to obtain information in the former count.
It appears, however, that in the eagerness to reduce
the expense the process of simplification has been
carried too far. Thus it is reported that no provi
sion has been made for taking a separate census of
the Indian population, and as a consequence the Cen
sus Bureau has quite a perplexing little problem on
its hands.
It is evident there should be an enumeration of the
Indians, for they are a part of the population, but. if
they arc not to be treated and described in a sep
arate report, how is the enumeration to be made?
An Indian tribe is in many respects a distinct na
tionality. The members of it cannot be justly
counted as citizens of a State, and, moreover, the
reservations upon which they live are not legally parU
of the State or Territory which surrounds them.
To add to the difficulty of the question it is ex
pressly provided in the constitution that: "Repre
sentatives shall be apportioned among the several
States, according to their, respective numbers, count
ing the whole number of persons in each State, ex
cluding Indians not taxed." That fastens upon the
census officials the duty of enumerating Indians in
some fashion, whether it be done separately or not.
Out of that duty, moreover, comes the further
problem of determining what is meant by the phrase
"Indians untaxed." The Indian, like every other per
son in the United States, is subject to internal rev
enue duties, and to the various stamp duties. Are
such duties to be counted as taxes? If they are, can
the Indian who pays them be regarded as "untaxed"
within the meaning of the constitution?
A recent circular issued from the Census Office, in
discussing the question, says: "Whether or not a
stamp duty is a tax, and, if it is. whether it is a direct
tax, whether 'Indians not taxed' means Indians not
directly taxed, or whether it may not mean Indians
not taxable! are questions that must be decided by
the Census Office before it can form its plan for the
Indian enumeration. The last question has been a
subject of debate ever since Indian censuses have been
taken. In 1890 there were about 50,000 civilized In
dians living among the general population of the
United States. Such Indians are citizens of the
United States, but many of them "arc too poor to pay
taxes. Are they to be excluded from the population
according to which representation in Congress, is
apportioned? We count every Chinese and other
alien of whatever sort or condition. Before the war
we counted every negro slave as equivalent to three
fifths of a white man. It seems manifestly absurd to
believe that the framers of the constitution meant to
exclude a class of citizens who are also natives be
cause of their poverty. In other words, the framers
of the constitution must have said what they did not
mean. What they really meant was to exclude all
Indians belonging to a class riot subject to taxation."
It appears the officials have not yet decided the
question, but the problem, : fortunately, is more,
curious than important. In the end some way will
be found to enumerate the Indian population without
mixing them with the citizens of States or Terri
tories. This census, in fact, promises to be much bet
ter than any^ which has been taken, and will be free
from many of those troublesome features which were
so objectionable in that of-iBoo.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
British naval experts claim that vessels
built in France, Germany and Russia ex
ceed the cost of vessels of similar type
built in Great Britain by 20, 30 and 40 per
cent, a condition of affairs which seriously
handicaps those three countries in catch
ing up with the British naval strength.
The Russian battleship Slnoyse of the
Black Sea fleet is to be reboilered and re
ceive Belleville boilers. The vessel whs
launched in 1887 and has performed little
or no service during her ten years on the
active list, and the record of boiler en
durance is probably the lowest In any
navy. ' ; _____
The First Lord of the Admiralty recent
ly offered a brief explanation in Parlia
ment of the causes which have led to the
practical failure of the Queen's yacht. Mr.
Goshen explained that the weights had
been underestimated and that Sir William
White, director of naval construction, ad
mitted that mistakes had been made, for
which he (White) was' at present unable ti
account.
The German nation is evidently .begin
ning to take a lively interest in naval af
fairs. The German Navy League had on
January 15 last a membership of 101,546,
of which 9590 had joined since December
25, 1899. Affiliated with the league are a
large number, of naval clubs with a mem
bership of 152,976, making a grand total of
254.522 directly or indirectly members of
the league. '
The Shikishima fired her twelve -inch
turret guns with Intervals of forty-five
seconds between rounds. The shell welj;hj
850 pounds and the explosive charge is
cordite weighing 145 pounds, giving a muz
zle velocity of 2300 feet per second. The
gun crew was untrained, and with a l'ttle
practice two shots per minute is antici
pated, the best record hitherto being six
rounds in 1 minute and 47 seconds, on
board H. M. S. Illustrious.
A remarkably speedy steam launch lias
recently been "built in England. The beat
is built of cedar, thirty feet in length, six
feet beam and three feet draught, and
weighs complete with steam up only 423'J
pounds. The boiler is a modified Thorrey
croft, aÂ«id the machinery weight is only
twenty-eight rounds per horsepower.
With 300 pounds of steam and the screw
making 1100 revolutions the boat made an
average speed of 14.75 knots.
The Koeningin Regentes, armored coast
defense ship, building at Amsterdam for
the Dutch navy, is an enlargement and
improvement of the Evertsen type. belnÃ
5000 tons displacement, against 3400 tons
for the Evertson. The. vessel Is 312 feet in
length, '4B feet- beam and 18 feet draught,
and with 5300 horsepower is expected t ?
steam sixteen kpots. The armor belt is of
Harveyized nickel steel six inches ?hick,
the two barbettes are ten inches j and the
protection deck two inches. The arma
ment consists ,of two 9.4-lnch 45 caliber,
four 6-inch 43 caliber, eight 3-lnch guns
and two one-pounders. * The normal coal
supply is 680 tons. Yarrow boilers are
solely used, in the Koeningin Regente*.
and this type of boilers has been adopted
entirely, for the navy of Holland.
The^ scarcity of sailors is felt in all'r.a
vles, and even the great steamship lines
are inconvenienced. Hitherto the Scandi
navian countries and German provinces on
the Baltic have supplied the deficiencies
of other countries," but the increase of for
eign trade of those countries has; given
employment to ; all native seafaring men.

SCRATCHING POSTSâ W. F. O'D.,
City, i There never was In Scotland a post
designated as "scratching post." The
Duke of Argyle at one time had a number
of tall mile posts erected, and a country
man once wishing to dislodge a flea that
had settled between his shoulders, rubbed
against one of the posts, and exclaimed:
"God bless the Duke of Arglye for putting
up scratching posts," and from that arose
the statement that there were scratching
posts In* Scotland.

new leaves. If that will not do place a
five-inch board edging around the beds tr.
the . garden and occasionally coat the

TO SAVE THE BIG TREES
GRATIFYING, indeed, is the announcement
from Washington of the passage by the .House
of the resolution of Congressman de ( Vries
authorizing the Secretary of the Interior, to- open
negotiations for the purchase of the famous groye
of big trees in Calaveras. Early'during the week the
measure will be called up in the Senate by Senator
Perkins, and there is every assurance it will receive
there an attention not less prompt and favorable than
in the House. - -
With the passage of the measure the redemption of
the grove from the destruction which threatened is
virtually assured. It is not likely the Secretary
of the Interior will delay in acting upon the authority
given him, or that the lumberman of Duluth who
holds the bond upon the grove will interpose any
serious obstacles in the way of the purchase. The
big trees, which as a living grove are invaluable,
would be of no great value when reduced to firewood,
lumber, shakes and shingles. It will, therefore, be to
the advantage of the owner to dispose of them to
the Government, and no doubt he will gladly do so.
If, however, for any cause he should be foolish
enough to desire to destroy the grove, action will
be taken by Congress to authorize the Government
to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire the
land.
In the satisfaction felt over the prospect of pre
serving the grove the public should not neglect to
give due credit to the energetic men and women of
the State to whose public spirit and action the present
good results arc primarily due. Every notable work
performed in this way for the general good is a mat
ter for congratulation. It will encourage further ef
forts for State improvements by co-operation and
lead to many results hardly less important than the
preservation of the wonderful trees.

It is customary to extend all possible
courtesies to visiting naval officers on
board ships of war. All parts of the ship
are open, for inspection and admiration,
and there is only one particular locality,
that of the submerged torpedo room,
which by a common understanding is con
sidered terra incognito. Thus when the
visitor in his tour of inspection comes to
this particular room there is considerable
vexation in discovering that the door !Â¦
locked; the officer in charge of the visit
ing party makes frantic efforts to find the
man to whom the key has been intrusted,
but there is no record that he has ever
been found. Apologies are offered and gra
ciously accepted,' and the party wends its

Inspect and sample the small stores, the

Shikishima was recently visited by British
naval officers it was found that the nisn

Let the workingmen's unions and industrial associations have delegates, before the

WAGNER is upon us with all
its .thundering harmonies.
The greatest American dis

composer, Walter Dam

nerian singer, Mme. Gadski, arrived in
this city yesterday afternoon from Los
Angeles. The third member of the
party, David Bisphara, will arrive this
morning. This is Damrosch'e first
visit to the coast, but Mme. Gadski Is
well known here since her visit last
year with the Ellis Opera Company.
"Ah, this is such a beautiful place,"
said Mme. Gadski In her rooms at the
Palace, "and the memory of my suc
cess here a year ago has urged me to
return to San Francisco."
Mme. Gadski was thinking of "Aida."
and her husband, who was sitting by.
her side, arose and finished the speech
for the prima donna. He is Herr
Taucher, the American agent of the
Mauser Rifle Company.
"Ach," continued Herr Taucher.
"when madame was last here â well,
there was too much Melba and too
much Jealousy. But I shall say noth
ing about it. Melba would not allow
madame her proper chance, and Ellisâ Â¦
well, I shall say nothing about It. On
the show bills Melba's name was In

his hands apart to show the size.
"And then De Lussan. she came next.

Gadski, was the third on the bills and

"Ach, the people of San Francisco

THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE GAMBLERS.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 5, 1900.
WHEN the Supervisors to-day take under consideration the Tobin resolutions pro
viding for unlimited race track gambling at Inglesi de, l the gamblers and their at
torneys should not be permitted to have the field wholly to themselves. The rep
resentatives of the people should be present to denounce the wrong, to protest against any
toleration of race track gambling, and to uphold public morality and the welfare of the
home.
The Police Committee, of which Supervisor Tobin is chairman, treated the pro
tests made by eminent pastors of the city against the resolutions with scant courtesy.
Nevertheless the protests were not ineffective. Having been published by The Gall, they
were widely read and have done much to strengthen popular sentiment on the issue.
Therefore when the Supervisors meet to-day they will give a more attentive hearing to
advocates of protection to the home than was given by the Tobin committee. In fact,
despite the boasts of the gamblers that they have a majority of the Supervisors fixed, it
is certain they will be beaten on the issue if the people show themselves resolute and
It is to be borne in mind. the people enter the. contest with the prestige of victory
on their side. The gamblers were defeated a year ago and track gambling at Ingleside
was suppressed. The forces which attained the reform can maintain it undiminished if
they continue to act with vigor. It is not credible that a majority of Supervisors will fly
in the face of public sentiment and nullify a victory for morality for the sole purpose of
affording a gang oft Eastern gamblers a- legal means of fleecing the city.
The importance of the issue is well known. Track gambling has been tried in San
Francisco and there is hardly any class of society that has not suffered from its effects. It
has led men to abandon their families, women to neglect their homes, boys to commit
petty thefts, clerks to practice embezzlement, public officials to become plunderers of the
public treasury, confidential employes to betray the trust reposed in them, and it has
brought many a victim to the Police Courts, to the criminal courts, to prison, to the
morgue and to the grave.
Let every man who has had a friend ruined by race track gambling go before the
Supervisors to-day* and denounce the Tobin scheme. ,
Let every business man whose employes are exposed to the temptations which
have led so many others of their class to commit defalcations make protest against a re
newal of the gamblers' license.
Let every pastor within whose congregation some family has suffered from the
blight of the widespread curse stand among the representatives of the people to-day
and demand its suppression.
Let the taxpayers have their representatives before the board to oppose granting a
license to an evil which entails upon-the municipality so large a cost 'for the maintenance
of police, criminal courts, coroner's fees and the morgue.
Let the civic improvement clubs protest against a "scheme which will enable a
gang of Eastern sharpers to carry from thecity the earnings which should be expended
in the erection of homes, the support of families and the advancement of the general wel
fare.

the Hannon property, on the CalaveraÂ»
River below Petersburg, this county, has
been leased to a San Francisco company
for twenty years for mining purposes.
Twenty thousand dollars' worth of ma

party something of his .own far-seeing
statesmanship.
Jeff erson's Administration.
The party of State sovereignty entered
upon the conduct of national affairs
strong in the support of the masses of the
population. The people were just.awak
ing to a realization of their own power
and a sense of their own responsibility
for the government of the country. Jef
ferson stood for this new sentiment, for
this rising spirit of democracy; for the
passing away of privilege, of the domina
tion of the. men of position and wealth
and dignity; he stood for government by
the common people. Republicanism of a
new sort had appeared In the world and
was becoming conscious of itself. Against
this new spirit the old Federalism made
but feeble resistance. Many of the party
members retired from political life In dis
gust. Those who continued active in af
fairs conducted themselves with little
party wisdom. They did Indeed resist
with justice and with credit to them
selves the repeal of the judiciary law
passed by the Federals in their very last
days of power creating twenty-three new
Judgeships: but they also opposed the pur
chase of Louisiana and other popular
measures.
In - ISO 4 Jefferson's re-el*ctlon was a

ONLY A SUGGESTION,
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense would suggest that if
one wishes to become fleshy and plump
it can only result from the food we eat
and digest and that â¢ food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
eggs, beefsteak - and. cereals: in other
words the kinds of food that make flesh
are the foods which form the greater
part of our daily bills of fare.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally I too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not properly digest and assimilate it,
which is the reason so many people re-
main thin and under weight: the diges-
tive organs do not. completely digest the
flesh forming beefsteak and eggs and
similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such who are
really confirmed dyspeptics, although
they may have no particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
If such persons would lay their preju-
dices aside and make a regular practice
of taking, after each meal, one or two
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the food
would be quickly and thoroughly digest-
ed, because these tablets contain the nat-
ural peptones and diastase which every
weak stomach lacks, and by supplying
this want the stomach is soon enabled to
regain its natural and vigor. ,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest every
form of flesh-forming food, meat, eggs,
bread and potatoes, and this Is the rea-
son they so quickly build up, strengthen
and Invigorate thin, dyspeptic men,
women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
delicate, use them with marked \ benefit
as they contain no strong/irritating
drugs, no cathartic nor any harmful in-
gredient,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the most
successful and most widely known of any
remedy for stomach troubles because they
are the most reasonable and scientific of
modern medicines. < ,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
every druggist in the United States and
Canada as well as in Great Britain, at 50
cents for complete treatment. .
Nothing further Is required to cure any
stomach . trouble or to make thin, nerv-
ous, dyspeptic people strong, plump and
well. " :

Four years later, under the dissatisfaction
due to the embargo act and the injury
which It worked. to business, a small ad
ditional number of votes were counted
for the Federal candidates, but the party
was not really strengthened. The Re
publicans, meantime, through the Irre
sistible force of events saw that their
predilection for strong State governments
along with a weak National Government.
If carried to Its -logical conclusion, would,
doom the Infant nation to disaster and

Madison's two terms covered the rerlofl

Longing for peace himself, ho could not
resist the general feeling which demanded
war. -The provocation was very great,
and, except in N<Â»w England, the country
supported the war policy. New England,
as the wealthiest and the most commer
cial section of the country and the last
stronghold of Federalism, endured, with
growing bitterness, the injury to her busi
ness prosperity and the oppressive exac
tions necessitated by the war. The dis
satisfaction culminated in 1314 in the call-
Ing of the Hartford convention, whose
proceedings, though secret, were believed
to look to the secession of New England
from the Union. The complete journal
of the convention an.i report of Its action
was afterward published and was found
to contain nothing treasonable or sedi
tious. (See "History of the Hartford

I. THE FEDERALIST PARTY.
(Concluded.)
BY JESSE MACY, LLD.D.
The First Disputed Election.
The campaign of IMO, with Adams and
Pinckney at the head of the Federal
ticket again Jefferson and Burr. Republi
cans, was an exciting one, and the result
turned upon the-methods of choosinp elec
tors in the various States. Those methods
being regulated entirely by each State for
itself differed widely and Rave a variety
of opportunity for political intrigue. In
the Electoral College Adams received
sixty-live votes, Jcl'ferson and Burr each
seventy-three. By a. constitutional provi
sion the tie" between the two names on
the Republican ticket threw the choice of
a. 'President finally into the House of Rep
resentatives, which had a Federal major-.
ity. There was .no doubt that Jefferson
had been intended' by. his party for the
Presidency and was the people's choice;
but the Federalists in tho House delib
erated with the purpose of either permit
ting no election or of selecting the man
likely to do their party the least mischief.
They strove to extort promises from both
candidates, but without success, though
Burr was disposed to hold out Induce
ments. Hamilton's influence was thrown
in! favor, of Jefferson, whom he consid
ered likely to be less violent and more
temporizing in his policy than Burr, and
Bayard of Maryland is credited with hav
ing finally determined the result. Tho Ion?
contest over our first disputed Presiden
tial election ended, therefore. In making
Thomas Jefferson our third" President,
with Aaron Burr art .Vice President. The
Federal party now surrendered the offices
of government, never to return to power.
Its after history Is that of an opposition
party growing ever more feeble and hope
lets. The old ideas and the old issues
were passing away, and the death of
Hamilton in the fatal duel with Aaron
Burr removed the greatest of the Federal
leaders who might liave been able, had he
survived, to infuse into the conduct of his

TEXAS REPUBLICANS TO
SEND TWO DELEGATIONS
Split in the Party at County and Con
gressional Conventions Has
Not Been United.
WACO, Tex.. March 4.â lt Is believed
that the Republicans will 'send two dele
gations from Texas to the next national
convention. They will open their conven
tion in this city on' Tuesday. Up to the
present time nearly every county and
Congressional convention held in th.Â»
State has split and sent two delegations
to the State convention. It has been ex
pected all along that there would be an
opposing leader to State Chairman E. 11.
R. Green at the coming convention in the
person of John Grant, who led the Mc-
Kinley forces four years ago in this State.
The fact, however, that Mr. Grant has re
cently issued a card In which he states he
will not participate In the convention
leads to the surmise that the anu-Green
ites will have to look to other sources for
a leader. Prominent Republican leaders
.in this section say that the party friction
*is not due to any antagonism to President
McKinley. ,

SAN DIEGO, March 4.â The San Diego
Chamber of Commerce has passed a reso
lution requesting Congressman Needham
of this' district to do all that he can In
support of the bill for the national appro
priation of $50,000 in aid of the proposed
Pacific Coast Commercial Museum which
is planned by the. University of Califor

to the Congressman and the bill will re
ceive his hearty support. The museum,
which is to be on the same lines as the
Philadelphia museum, will show the raw

is handled.
SACRAMENTO., March 4.â The election of Lieutenant Colonel H. I. Seymour
to the colonelcy of. the Second Regiment, infantry. Third Brigade. National
Guard of California, gives satisfaction to military men. with whom, the new
colonel has long been popular, and insures the retention of regimental head
quarters in Sacramento. â¢ ' - '
The newly elected' colonel enlUted in Battery E, First Artillery. Novem
ber 11, ISS4, became a sergeant on. March 30, ISBS. was advanced to second lieuten
ant on December 17, 18S5. became first lieutenant November .ll, 18S6, and was chosen
captain of Company E. Second Infantry, on October 12, 18S7. and continued as srch
until June 14, 1595, when he was elected lieutenant colonel of the regiment. He was
placed on the retired list 1 February 15, 1305, but he has long been spoken of as a
desirable head of the regiment. When the election occurred last night Colonel Sey
mour was absent from -the city, but at his direction a banquet had been prepared
for the officers at the French restaurant, and Lieutenant de Finnes ably presided
in his absence. Â¦. . .. ......
The story is that at the. former attempt to elect a colonel E. A. Forbes of
Marysville had promised to support Seymour, but when he reached town he
thought he had enough votes to elect- himself, and therefore went against Sey
mour, with the result that there was no choice. I^ast night, however, he decided
to cast his strength for Seymour. a!:. 1 Seymour's friends, who had intended this
time to vote for, Colonel J. W. Guthne. returned to their original favorite, w'Â»h
the result of Colonel Seymour's election.

PERKINS IS
IN FAVOR OF
SEATING QUAY
Will Speak in Support of a
Resolution in His
Behalf. ...
Work Laid Out for the Senate This
Week Includes a Debate on
â¢ the Porto Bican Gov
ernment Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The question
of seating Senator Quay, the conference
report on tho currency bill and the Porto
Rican government bill will divide the at
tention of the Senate during the present
week. By agreement .the report on the
currency bill will be voted upon at 4 p. m.
Tuesday and will have practically the un
divided attention of the Senate until that
time if there are Senators who desire to
speak on it.
After Monday the Quay, resolution will
be the uppermost topic during the morn
ing hour each day, and the Porto Rican
bill for the remainder of the day. Among
those who will 'spealt on the Quay resolu
tion are Senators Penrose, Spooner, Per
kins and Carter favorable to Quay, and
Senator Burrows. in- opposition.
Senators Culbertson. Turley and Petti
grew will make set arguments against tht
Porto Rican bill on constitutional grounds,
and Senators Nelson and Depew will talk
in support of it. The question of expan
sion will be raised in connection with this
measure, and it will provoke much run
ning debate as well as many set speeches.
Seriator Foraker, who is in charge of the
bill, says there is no disposition to accept
the House bill and drop the Senate meas
ure, as has been reported in some quar
ters would be done.
The diplomatic and pension appropria
tion bills probably will be passed during
the week. .
The House will devote this week, ex
cept to-morrow, which is District of Co
lumbia day. to contested election cases.
ThÂ» debate on the Aldrleh-Robbins case
will be resumed Tuesday. After it is dis
posed of the Wlse-YounÃ contest from
Virginia will be taken up and probably
will consume the remainder of the week.
In both cases the majority has reported
against the sittlnsr members, who are
Democrats, and the House will probably
sustain the reports.

FIRST PICNIC
OF THE SEASON
A BIG SUCCESS
Crowds of Pleasure Seekers
Go to Shell Mound
Park.
Skilled Marksmen at the Shooting
Ranges Compete for Many Val
uable Cash Prizes and
Medals.
?
It required four special trains to trans
port 5000 people to Shell Mound Park yes
terday, the occasion being the first picnic
of the season given by Captain L. Slebe,
the proprietor of the East Berkeley pleas
ure grounds. The threatening stata of
the weather failed to keep away the Im
mense throngs, who were amply repaid
for their temerity by a fine day's enjoy
ment. Dancing in the two big pavilions
under the direction of Julius Evers and
Fred Pinkham was indulged in by a ma
jority of the pleasure seekers, though all
of the many. sources of amusement came
in for a large share of attention. It was
after 6 o'clock when the merry-makers
reluctantly dispersed and the returning
trains were taxed to their utmost capa
city-.
A large number of marksmen gathered
at the shooting ranges during the day,
though but three organizations were- rep
resented at the targets. The day was not
favorable for good results, the following
scores being only a little above the aver
age:

the day. The distribution of prizes was
held at the close of the shooting.

PRESIDENT WILLIAMS
ON CALIFORNIA RACING
Praises the Local Game in an Inter
view With a Chicago Turf
Correspondent.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢CHICAGO, March 4.â Thomas H. Wil
liams, the California sportsman, reached
Chicago from San Francisco this morning
and registered at the Wellington Hotel.
Although Mr. Williams has raced no
horses 3ince 1893. he is president of the
California Jockey Club and still retains
his fondness for thoroughbreds. Mr. Wil
liams will remain In this city for a couple
of weeks. His trip here was made simply
for pleasure and to obtain rest from busi
ness cares. It had been the intention of
the Westerner to join this year's ranks of
American turfmen who have invaded
England. He had been offered the pick
of some of the best California stables and
had purposed taking n string of four or
five high-class horses across the water.
Recently, however, his uncle died and in
creased business pressure. obliged him to
give up the project. When seen at, the
Wellington Hotel to-night Mr. Williams
said:
"I am sorry to have to give up the idea
of taking a few good horses to England
next summer, but business prevents me
making the trip. I had hoped to take a
good vacation abroad, and thought per
haps * I might be able to win -one or two
; minor English turf events. 1 believe in
entering American horses ,in Â«' foreign
races. : We have plenty iof good ; animals
; over here, and there.is.no reason- why
many English events should not fall to
American : owners. American 'Â¦ horses and
American -jockeys are better than the ani
mals and boys in England, and ; therefore,
it seems to me the foreign- tracks offer a
good field for enterprising American own
ers; :;:Â¦.' ' â .r Â¦ .-,. .."j :% , '..- ' Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦,Â¦ : >â¢ *Â«
/â¢Racing in" California- is very good
thia season. There are plenty 'of speedy
horses on the Pacific Coast and the tracks
are fa st. It was â¢ too Â» bad that the . rain
bpoiled the Burns handicap yesterday. It
would have Â» been a I erand l race I had l the
track been in good condition.- No, I shall
not race in the East this year,"
In the Handball Court.
The attendance at Phil Ryan's hand
ball court, K>S Howard street, was above
the average yesterday afternoon. Much
enthusiasm was manifested over the
game between Kilgallon, Linehan. Rior
dan and White, who are looked upon in
the local court as being among the crack
players. The other games were also well
contested and brought forth much ap
plause from the spectators. The scores

CITY OF MEXICO, March 4.âProfes
sor Marshall Saville. representing the
American Museum of Natural History of
New York, has left for home, taking
many unique objects discovered by him
at the ruins near the prehistoric city of
Mitla, in the State of Oaxaca. The prin
cipal work -of the professor was the un
covering of many ancient mounds over
grown with forests, to which a road had
to be constructed.
Duke de Loubat, himself Interested in
archaeological research, describes the
work of Professor Saville as most Im
portant. Half of the objects discovered
go to the Mexican Government under the
agreement made previously.

SANTA CLARA. March 4.â ln the
eighth inning-, with the score 2 to 1 in
favor of, Santa Clara and three men on
bases. Havens, the hara-hittins outfielder
of Stanford, struck out. This was the only
chance Stanford hikl of winning - In â¢Â¦ the
Bame played on the Stanford campus
Thursday. A large crowd was present and
witnessed one of the finest games played
on the campus this season. The work of
the Stanford infield was somewhat
ragged, while that of Santa Clara could
not have been improved. .The hitting of
both sides was rather light, due, no doubt,
to the fact that both Lanagan and Kelly
pitched in excellent form.

Exciting Ccurses Between Closely

T-IItANK McCOMB'S black wonder.
L( Royal Flush.? justified the confidence
{ of the betting men yesterday by win*
v.iv.g the valuable open stake at
L'rior. Coursing rarU. He seemed stronger
sr.d fa?ter than on the previous Sunday
in th<* John Grace Gup stake. Only two
poir.ts were scored against him in the five
courses. Th^ss were to the credit of Cur
tia <Â£.- Son's Narclstu?. In the others he
defeated J L Ft, C-0; Handom Aim, 4-0;
Maud S, 5-0; and In the all-Important de
cidlr.jr course. Flyirg Fox, 5-0. For a Time
it seemed Master Ciair or Flying Fox
would win. The former weakened In the
r^xt to the last round and was retired
before i:e could get into the final. In the
fourth round Flush stumbled and
Tvrer.chfd his r'.sht shoulder. He was
taken off the f.e!d slightly lame, but came
back gamely for the two additional
ccurses which determined the possession
of the long end of the purse.
Dcgs Evenly Matched.
Thf dops vrerc so evenly matched
throughout the day that betters seemed
e.Vt ai sea. In the tlrst iwcrsty-four
courses eleven favorites 10.-t. The raosc
cotable tit:'i-ais were these of Kecording

3r. the rext to the last round Master
Â«;a:r and K!yirs Fox v.ere unfortunate
Irs rurmiiis: an undecided course which did
not improve either of their enances in the
final. The coursing went on without ln
xeiruption. althougn thore were a number
of sharp Boowers which drenched the Held
officials a:i<l the handlers of doss.
The surprise of the ttake was the run

ROWELL'S NAME
IS SYNONYMOUS
WITH GOOD LUCK
Many Thing 3 Favored Impe
rious, Winner of the
Burns Handicap.
Marty Bergen Signs to Bide for Louis
Ezell â Bannockburn Will Be
Shipped East â Entries
â¢ at Oakland.
Thegood fortune of Dr. Rowell, owner
of the Burns handicap winner, Impe
rious, was food for much gossip among
turfmen in general yesterday. Surely
the fates contributed to the victory of
his horse iln many ways. The gelding
was well treated by the handicapper, and
in answer to the weather signals which
the doctor had been displaying over the
stable, it began raining on the morning
of the race. Burns & Waterhouse made
a dicker to get the services of Tommy
Burns, and J. \V. Schorr purchased Acro
bat Just previous to the race. Pat Mor
rfssey was ridden by Thorpe, carrying
Beven pounds overweight, it Is said. At
this the gelding led his field to the sad
dling paddock, and with 102 pounds, his
allotted weight in the saddle, what might
he not have done? Then again. Spencer
refused to ride Topmast, lie was per
fectly willing to pilot Advance Guard, the
three-year-old, which nobody thought
had a chance at the weights, but not the
older horse. Three furlongs from the
wire Topmast, last but one of his field,
made a phenomenal run, and was beaten
but two lengths and two heads for the
long end of the prize. Dr. Sheppard, one
of the top weights, ruined his chances by
running out with T. Walsh, as well as
bursting one of his hoofs. And finally
Devin, who rode Imperious, had become
so saddle stale, being unable to ride a
winner, that h'.s services were In no de
mand. However, Dr. Rowell is a most
painstaking and popular horseman, ami
no one begrudged him the victory. With
the capture of the Burns his stable win
nings foot up the handsome sum of $17,
295.
Within three weeks Barney Schrelber
will ship Bannockburn back to his stock
farm at Woodlands, near St. Louis, where
the great brown horse will serve a short
season in the stud. He will then receive
a preparation for the summer campaign.
Marty Bergen has signed a contract to
ride for Louis Ezell. With plenty of work
In the saddle to do Marty may regain his
old time form. /; Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢>-,
From all accounts the Jockeys ball,
held on Saturday evening, was a pro
nounced success. Tommy Burns carried
off the gold-headed whip awarded the
most popular rider, with Spencer a close

Seven Amateur Champions Who Will Contest at the Olympic Club.
1 wrestling wonders of the East,
I who are champions in their
| elapses and who will take part
"*â¢ in the big Olympic Club tour
nament which opens Tuesday night,
arrived yesterday afternoon. Al
though on the road during the last
five days, the men are in splendid
condition and show no lack of train
ing.
Tho party consists of three boxers
and four wrestlers. The men of the
"mighty mil" are John IS. Scholes
Jr.. feather-weight; J. J. Dukelow,
welter, and \V. Rod^nbech, middle
weight. William Kelson, Joseph
Renzland, August Kurtzland and the
cyclonic Max Wiley are four wrest
lers who wiped off everything else
jroni me mais in me ii>asi. \\ ney
and Scholes are the men whose ath
letic â¢ prowess has earned for them
the backing of every Eastern ath
lete. When these men meet the West
erners there will be a clash that will
please the lovers of both the glove
and mat sports, for both are hard,
game little athletes.
John Hammersmith and H. V.
Ramsdell formed themselves Into a
reception committee to go up the road
and meet the visiting athletes at Port
Costa. "Leader" John became knot
ted up with telegrams and time-tables
and, forgettinp that there is a differ
ence between the Atlantic Express
and the Sunset, piloted the crowd over
to the ' Sixteenth-street station four
hour 3 in advance of the arrival of
me train, ai i>ean, wno win xaite
charge of the Easterners, was one of
those who waited.
On this side of the bay a delegation
from the Olympic Club and a large
'bus were on hand. The visitors
were taken to the club and generally
introduced.
The seven athletes who arrived yes
terday are a sturdy lot of young ath
letes, rather inclined toward the
stocky in build. They say they are
in perfect shape. At any rate they
are confident and will not shirk work,
having . gone through tournaments
that meant constant fighting and
wrestling ', for several days. While
in this city they will live near the
Olympic Club, taking their meals at
the club. * â¢Q Dr. G i bbo n's Dispensary,

scrape, which may yet prove a murder,
occurred to-night at Emeryville, beyond
the racetrack. One man, cut and slashed
so that death will probably result, has
been brought to the Oakland Receiving
Hospital; another, nearly as badly hurt,
has b**n taken to his home at West
Berkeley, while the men who did the cut
ting have escaped and there is not the
slightest possibility of tracing them, for
the wounded man refuses to talk, ana
those who witnessed the affair are shield
ing the men who did the cutting.
The trouble occurred in the saloon kept
by a man by the name of Giblin, between
Emeryville "and Butchertown, and Is said
to have been the result of a quarrel over
a crap game. Emeryville, the racetrack
town, having no police force and no hos
pital facilities a telephone message was
gent to Oakland, asking for the police am
bulance to bring a wounded man to the
hospital. The man was found in Giblin's
saloon on a table, with some temporary
dressing applied by a local doctor. His
companion lay on the floor beside the ta
ble, and blood was splashed all over the
place, showing that a struggle had oc
curred.
The man most seriously Injured was
taken to the Oakland Hospital. Â¦ where
he gave the name of Arthur Inwood.
while the other man was taken home.
The men about absolutely refused to say
anything, and as It was outside of the
Oakland city limits it was a case for tho
Sheriff's office.
At the hospital Inwood refused to say
anything or to even give the name of his
wounded companion, who had been taken
home by some friends. Inwood and his
friends were formerly employed at the
Judson Powder Works and stopped work
last week. They had a little money and
went to the saloon near the track where,
it is said, they got into a crap game.
There was trouble over the game, and
as nearly aa can be learned two negroes
drew raxors and literally carved Inwood
and his friend to pieces.
Inwood received half a dozen great
gashes across the stomach and side. His
companion was cut about the head and
arms. Inwood is so badly cut and lost
so much blood that he will probably die.

AFRO-AMERICANS DISCUSS
SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE LAWS
Will Institute a Case in Louisiana to
Test the Validity of the Meas
ure Affecting Negroes.
WASHINGTON. Marcn 4.â An impor
tant conference of Afro-Americans was
held here yesterday, at Â¦which the test oi
the suffrage law legislation of the South
ern States, especially Louisiana, was
thoroughly discussed. Arsons those pres
ent were T. Thomas Fortune of New
York, chairman of the executive commit
tee of the National Afro-American Coun
cil: Jesse Lawson of New Jersey, chair
man of the sub-executive committee:
Representative White of Nor t -Â» Carolina,
Thomas" L. Jones of Virginia. W-aam
Calvin Cha?e. editor of the Washington
Bee; Edward E. Cooper, editor of the
Washington Colored American; Daniel
Murray of the Congressional Library.
Professor William R. Richards, dean oÂ£
the law department of Howard Univer
sity: Profeeaor Bruce Evans and others.
The conference was not held under the
auspices of the National Afro-American
Council, but it was decided to indorse the
action of the council in determining to
bring to a rtnal test the constitutionality
of the suffrage clause of the Louisiana
constitution, and a sufficient amount of
money was raised to insure the institution
of a proper case in Louisiana and to see
that it reaches the Supreme Court of the
United States for final adjudication, if
necessary. The test caee will be brought
at once.

Peter's Penitence.
Key. E. Nolander, pastor of the First
English Lutheran Church, last night
preached on "Peter's Penitence." In part
he said:
The fall of Peter If a sad story, and wÂ«
search in vain for extenuating circumstance?.
Bring it before any Jury oi tried men and true,
and their verdict would bÂ« "gulltr." Â¦without
any recommendation to mercy. The fall was
due primarily to thoughtlessness. This Is a
common lault. We vote the-wron? ticket on
election day for want of thought. We fall
into evil bablts until :h-y bind us as with
adamantine chains for want of thought. An
other cause of his downfall was evil compan
ionship. He stood la the open court araons the
enemies of Jesus and warmed himself by the
fire. Vi'f cannot avoid associating with evil
men. We must mingle with them more or leÂ«s
closely in the street. In business. In society.
But we have no business to warm ourselves at
their fire. Associate with horsethleves, you
will become a horsethSef. Clan with gamblers,
and you will become a frainbler. Go among the
unclean, and you will be unclean. "A com
peslcn of fools shall be destroyed." Peter was
plucked as a brand from the b-jrniag.

side at a Successful Meeting in
Ho-vrard-Street Methodist
Episcopal Church.
The first of the series of revival service-3
to be held in the Howfrd-street Methodist
Episcopal Church ui/.er the direction cf
the Cooke family was held last evening.
Many more people than the church would
hold tried to gain admittance, but after
the aisles had been filled with people
standing and the halls had been packed
the ushers at the doors turned the lits
comers away.
The center of Interest was little Jack
Cooke. a lad of 13, who preached the ser
mon, answered the questions and brought
a crowd cf people to their knees befcrs
the chancel rail. All over the house peo
ple stood up, some to give testimony, of
their certain salvation, some to ask fo.
prayers and some to announce that they
would try to lead better lives in the fu
ture.
The young evangelist is a rapid, force
ful speaker. His words are well chosen
and clearly uttered. He never hesitates
for a phrase or expression, and altogether
he Is a wonder on the platform. He iias
all the ease and self-possession of a vet
eran speaker, and already he seems to
have caught the knack of Interesting an
audience and swaying it to his will.
The services will be held every night
this week at T:S) o'clock. Henry Cooke.

DRINK-CRAZED MAN
TRIES TO END LIFE
Wealthy Young Traveler Hacks His
Throat and Wrists With
a Razor. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. March 4.
With his throat gashed to the windpipe
and both wrists nearly severed by self
inflicted wounds. Ethtlbert F. Smith, a
scion of one of the wealthiest families of
New York City, was found wandering
about Wtst Oakland early this morning.
The young man was drenched to the
skin, having been exposed to last night's
storm, and was half craxed from the ef
fects-of a long drinking bout. He was so
weak from the severe hemorrhage from
the ugly cut? that by the time the police
ambulance had taken him to the Receiv
ing Hospital the demented wayfarer was
In a state of extreme collapse. The sur
geons with difficulty dressed his wounds.
for the patient was very violent.
After he was placed in a ward. Smith
gave battle to Hospital Steward Borchert
and made desperate efforts to tear the
futures and bandages from the cuts.
That he survived the insane attempts to
end his life was considered by the hos
pital attendants as remarkable.
Young Smith's efforts at suicide are the
result of his condition, bordering on in
sanity, which is the culmination of sev
eral "years of hard drinking. For two
vears'he had been with reiatlves in Japan,
where a brother-in-law. John Taylor, has
extensive importing interests at Kobe and
Nagasaki. Smith left Kobe on February
a, arriving here on the America Maru.

WITH the close of the season of fleld shooting the men
who are experts at the traps have taken up that pas
time with vigor. On all sides are heard predictions
that this will be the banner year for the gunmen on
this coast. The season was inaugurated yesterday on the
grounds of the San Francisco Trapshooting Association, In
gleslde. Many veterans were present, although all did not
participate in the shooting. Among the well-known gunmen
were J. K. Orr, Ed. Fay, "Johnny" Coleman. Otto Feudner,
A. M. Shields. "Pop" Verr.on, Edgar Fomer, Fred Feud
ner, A. T. Derby. I. R. D. Grubb. Herbert Ku'.lman. R.
Llddle, Henry Justlns and others. The members of the Cali
fornia Wing Shooting Club, who use only live birds, yester
day held the first of their meetings, which will extend over
the r.ext seven months. Otto Feudner started well, grassing
all his birds in clever fashion. A. M. Shields was unfortun
ate In some of his birds and just missed having a clean
score.
After the live bird shoot the "bluerock" grounds were
thrown open to the shooters. Edgar Forsier showed himself
in form by smashing M of the clay disks "without a miss.
Lugee broke 20 straight: Wilson, 3S out cf 40; Zeimer, Ti out
of 30. Among the others who shot for practice were: Jack-
Eon, Westover, Wagner. Reilly. Rickie. Clausen. Fuller.
Sweeny. Jansen, Sage, Fllckinger, Esfeldt, Brockbank and
Schrocder. A strong wind interfered with the shooters and
made it difficult to run up a big score unless the man was an
unusually good shot.
The greatest opportunity ever offered in San Francisco to
procure the Best Works of Modern Masters at purchaser's prices.
Sale commences at 8 o'clock Monday Evening, March sth,
and continuing during the week.

the very evident reason that such a
union of these two departments would
give the telegraphers absolute control of
the situation in the event of a lockout
cr a strike. With the key men and the
tower operators combined they could dely
the raiiroad company to move a single
train out of Its numerous terminal sta
tions, every one of which is under control
cf the block system of switches.
Since the strike of ISS4 the tower men
and block signal men have not been or
ganized.
Every means has been taken by the
Southern Pacinc Company to weaken the
influence of the employes' organizations,
which slowly were reinvifcorated after the
strike. The old brotherhoods and orders,
dormant for to long, have not been ag
gressive until very recently. Their new
life has been manifested, nowever. in a
sudden and apparently determined light,
which has been opened against the pro
j>osea "reiitf insurance auntzne," launch
ed by the company March 1.
The Southern I'aciiic employes are up !n
arms against the plan. There is not a
single nuÂ»n m tne employ of the Southern
Pacific company who will be affected by
this iMurance proposition who dees not
believe that one ol the prime reasons for
Jts Inauguration is to weaken the frater
nal organizations the men themselves
have for years conducted. AH of the great
railroad Drotnerhoods have an insurance
plan which is the very foundation of the
organization. Built upon this are the
many other Leneadary projects which
hold the men together, chief of which is
the ability to prÂ«rsect their various griev
ances and troubles solidly before the man
agement of the company.
With ihis situation confronting the men
and the officials there Is extraordinary
significance attached to the proposed re
habilitation of the telegraphers' order
upon the broader lines wnich have beci.
suggested.
That the move had not been underlain
tion of this relief department plan has
created. With the union of telegraphers
and towermen the company would find
an order which would have absolute con
trol of the situation in the event of trou
ble. The block signal men occupy most
responsible positions. A slight error on
their part might cause most disastrous
wrecks. But neither the towermen nor
the telecraphers have anything to gain
by the company's insurance bureau, be
cause to realize the full benefit from it a
man must be killed in the discharge of
duty. There is little risk of life In either
gosition. Of course a towerman might
c electrocuted at his switchboard, but
that is only a remote possibility. Other
wise he takes no risks, and the telegraph
ers have even less hazard In their places."
- The preliminary steps for a mass
meeting ot the representatives of the
various railroad brotherhoods to dis
cuss and protest against the pro
posed Southern Pacitlc relief bureau
department, was taken in West Oakland
this evening at the regular annual meet
ing of the West Oakland division of the
Order of Railway Conductors, and after
listening to the regular reports of the offi
cers the division indulged in a general dis
cussion of the proposed relief bureau
scheme and the effect that it might have
upon the brotherhoods in general and the
Brotherhood of Railway Conductors in
particular.
That the conductors regard the matter
with suspicion is evidenced by the fact
that they discussed the proposed mass
meeting to protest against the bureau,
and by a unanimous vot<> of the division
th? president was authorized to appoint
a committee of five members to consult
with likeicommittees to be appointed from
the other brotherhoods, these committees
to use their judgment in regard to iht
form that the proposed mass meeting of
protest shall take.

Mayor Johnson Resigns.
Special Diypmtch to The Ca.!L
MONTEREY. March 4.â R. F. John
son. Mayor of this city, has resigned his
municipal office, his resignation, which
was presented to the Board of City
Trustees at their last regular meeting,
Fnuay night, to take effect at once. This
action comes as a surprise to the towns
people, and it is stated that it is likely
no action toward appointing a successor
will be taken until after the coming mu
nicipal election, when the new Board of
Trustees will meet and elect its president,

. before this is due to the fact that only
; within a very short time was th<r discov- j
' cry made that the constitution of the tel- I
; trgraphers' union was broad enough to in- I
'. elude the block signal men. That this j
'Â¦ ihculd be brought to light at this time is i
: another evidence of the unrest which ex- I
I lsts among the railroad employes. It is a Â¦
! strong indication that they are reachinj* j
j out to strengthen th^ir lines and to make j
: a eland against encroachments upon what )
j many of them opf nly assert are their per- j
toral rights.
I The block signal men are not loth to j
' accept the proffered hand* of the teleg- |
j raphers. To be taken into a union of that i
character would, they assert, greatly im- j
prove their opportunities and would give I
them a standing they have not had with
the company when they made efforts to
adjust their grievances. There are paid
] to be from two hundred to three hundred
i j-icnal men in the company's employ.
i While unorganized they would not give the
i railroad any cause for special considera
tion, their affiliations with the telegraph
ers would mean, they assert, immediate
recognition as an important factor in the
settlement of grievances. Speaking of the
movement toward amalgamation with the
tel'irrapher*. a towerman said to-<lay:
â¢Â¦Both sides can rain materially by the
union of forces. It seems to be in the
air Just now. Railroad men are very
much wrought up- over the Insurance
scheme, and I suppose this proposed
amalgamation has been on# outcome of
the noticeable unrest which th* Dromul*a-

SANTA ROSA. March 4.â The post
mortem examination of the remains of
Mrs. Barney McNamara, which was
found floating in a well on the McNamara
place Friday, was completed this morning
ny Drs. 8. 8. Bogle. P. A. Meneray and
Coroner J. G. Pierce. No evidence of vio
ler.ee or foul play could be discovered,
and while several suspicious circum
stances yet remain to be investigated, the
general opinion is that little will come of
it and the tragic death will always re
main a mystery.

ANDREWSâ In this city. February 22, IXO, to
the wife of Nelson Andrews, a daughter.
one other of importance, the Mountain
Copper Company practically monopoiizia<
the product.
The development of copper properties re
mains very active, but few are produc
ing. Those that are producing do so by
making small shipments of- ore to S?lby"Â«.
These shipments are reported to be In
creasing somewhat, but they do npt meas
ure the activity of the copper field. Most
of the copper prospects being develojM?J
are being opened to sell or bond. Ihe
owner often ship? a little ore to help him
along, but most of it at such mines is left
on the dump. A good ore dump is not i
bad thing when investors and promoters
come smelling .around. If the price of
copper stays up for a year longer several
copper producing mines, will be add**', to
the liet. The urwaterinsr of the old Cop
peropolis mine goes on, but It is not known
whether the Boston owners figure on
working or selling it. The Copper King
mine, on the same belt as the Ne Pl'Jd
Ultra, Is being developed by its Engjlsh
owners, who plan a smelting plant. ,
There is and long has been a smelter
proposition announced here or there in t-e
State with each new. moon, but the plans
are generally to be traced to a windy
promoter. One recent announcement in
cluded a cattle ranch to -furnish beef t>
the worknien. . '
As the Kern River oil field develops
it promises to be'large and steady, but
not a prolific producer. It will soon be
shipping a considerable quantity of oil,
much of which the Santa Fe has con
tracted for, and will doubtless add largely
to this year's oil product.
Only very general information about
this field has been furnished. Little scien
tific study has been given it. The wells
which have struck oil so far show it to
be nearly four miles square, lying a little
northeast of Bakersfield, close to the,
Kein River. It is peculiar among Cali
fornia oil fields in that its oil-bearing
strata are not steeply inclined, but lie quite
flat*, pitching to the west at the rate of
only about 120 feet jto the mile. There
are several strata of oil in which the
oil Is retained by strata of clay no shales
occurring. The succession of formations
is shown by the log of the latest and one
of the deepest producing wells., the third
driven by the Peerless Company, and fur
nished by Attorney J. M. Wright of the
California Miners' Ass&eiation. This Is
the first definite report of the kind made
public. This is the way nature has piled
her layers by the Kern River: Earth,
gravel and dry quicksand, 242 feet; blue
clay. 35; water sand,. 20; blue clay, 3;
water sand. 40; blue clay. 18: oil sand, 42;
blue clay. 13; oil sand, 50: blue clay, 31;
oil sand. 101; blue clay and gravel, 13; oil
sand, 31; blue clay, 2; total, 74L
The drill has stopped in two feet of
blue clay. This is typical of all the other
-wells of the district. In this well oil was
struck at 458 feet. To the east it is found
sooner and to the west later. To the we9t
of the present oil area a well 1000 deep
has failed to strike oil yet. The oil rises
high in the wells and stands there. No
tests of the flow have been made. What
lies below the record 1 given is for fu;urÂ«
and deeper borings to tell. Just now ev
erybody is after the oil in siirht, and the
conditions are fine for hustling in pumps.
There are no compartments below corre
sponding to property lines above. A man
may have all the oil below him and one
welV could in time pump the whole dis
trict dry. So it is a big grabbag. and the
more wells a man gets through his acres
and the faster he pumps oil drawn from
under his neighbor the more ojl he will
get So they are going It strong- down
there and thinkin* more about pump*
than geology and laboratory, tests This
is a heavy oil, reported to afford 60 per
cent of lubricating oil and to be of high
fuel value. â¢ '-Â¦'< Â¦' â¢
California- mining, men take especial in
terest in thÂ« bill for creating } a Cabinet
department of mines and mining because
the movement for it was begun nnd long
supported by the California - Miners' As
sociation â¢as ; well a* because this State
would rereive great benefit from the ope
ration of such a department. A Urge
share of- its activity would be expended
on California. -.. "\ -'Â¦ Â¦";
The * recent favorable report of the
measure by the committee on mines and
mining to the House described the nature
of the bill and urged strong and interest
ing considerations in its favor. Tli e de
partment is placed on the same plane as
other Cabinet departments. "and of it the
report says that its design and duties
"shall be "to â¢ ucnuiro. by/; examination,
practical and. scientific experiments, geo
logical research nr otherwise. -useful In
formation on the subject of mining in the
comprehensive sense of the word, includ
ing mines and mining-,- â¢Â¦â¢ " * Â¦; ;Â¦* and all
other minerals ami mineral waters, as
well as waters used in mining, manufac
turing or developing . electric- power, and
to diffuse such information among the
people of the i United States." - -
. The department < is given the Geological
Survey and* everything in other depart
ments belonging to: It so that it could
make an enrW start fairly well equipped.
It ia-providÂ«d'-'that'the-act shall go into
effect March 4, 1901.
California. ; in spite of Its f Mining Â» Bu
reau,* presents strong corroboration of the
following "':Â¦ observation: " '"The : : want of
practical and ; scientific * Information: on
the j subject* ; connected * wlthVmlnes ; and
mining by the people of the United States
be of incalculable industrial value. There
is nothing of the sort now. The work of
the Geolcsrical Survey- has been of much
value to the mining industry. It would be
vastly increased under the new depart
ment. . .
The splendid work the n*w Department
ojt Agriculture, for the industries it rep
resents suggests the help such a depart
ment could be to the mining interests.
The first named department has opened
markets, stimulated and guided produc
tion for them and pushed products into
them, irhas taught what, to grow and
where.. It has taught the Western farm
er in semi-arid regions all th* ways of
building a home-made windmill out. of
barrel staves and things for Jl 50 and up
ward. The mining field is filled with prob
lems. The West is full of mountains now
as unproductive as the middle of a desert,
but rich in industrial potency. If Uncle
Sam shall come to California, etudy the
mountain torrents, map their power and
measure their possibilities, he will bless
the State. If he takes hold of the hy
draulic mining problem It will be solved
sooner. A comprehensive report on the
possibilities of gold dredging here would
stimulate that promising industry. Study,
experiment and recommendation as to the.
treatment of our refractory ores would
increase their development. Reports on
our mineral resources would draw atten
tion and capital.
The petroleum lands bill has been - In
troduced in Congress by Representative
Waters upon request of J. M. Wright,
chairman of the minera-1 lands commit
tee 'of the California Miners' Association,
and has been referred. It will receive,
strong backing by correspondence and
otherwise, and will likely become a law.
The San Joaquin Valley oil field? are be
ing investigated by two representatives
of the land department, -whose report will
largely Influence the course of the Inte
rior Department In the conflict between
the oil men and the scrippera.
The new three-compartment vertical
3500-foot shaft at the Kennedy- mine is
progressing at the rate of twenty feet a
week, andls down 1063 feet. It will take
another year or so to get down to thÂ»
2000 or 220U level, where tne first cross-cut
to the vein will be run.

ment falling on the gas pipes tore them apart. One of the pipes supplied
a street lamp and the other a dwelling just opposite the hole, and both ran
from the gas main on the south side of the street.
The immense hole in the pavement attracted a 6rowd of small boys, and
finally one of them, who smelled the gas escaping, decided to, have. some
fun. He succeeded wonderfully well. He got a match and, going to the
edge of the hole just over the brokeeri ends of .the gas pipes, dropped the
blazing brand in. The effect was instantaneous. "With a roar and a flash
the gas burst into flame, singeing the hair of the adventurous youngster and
scattering the crowd of urchins in all directions. It was much- more of a
fire than they had calculated on, and there was no way'of stopping it either.
The office of the Board of Public Works had been notified of the break in
the sewer, but the workmen sent to repair it could do nothing until the
gas company was notified and sent some one to turn off the pressure. The
gas was burning for some time, nciting the bitumen and burning the sand
against which the flame nlayed until it turned to brick. It was quite an
object of interest while it lasted, but It did no damage except to the hair
of the boy with the match.
Another interesting sewer break occurred on Sacramento street, near
Webster, Saturday evening. In. some way the sewer became choked and
the pressure from the hill accumulating finally lifted the bitumen between the
car' tracks for a distance of forty feet right into the -air and scattered It in
all directions, while the water spouted as if from a geyser. The sewer ex
ploded with a report like that of a gun.
like the average Christian of to-day, for
when he went out of the presence of
Christ or out of the house of God he still
found that there was some pride in his
soul.
"Christ told Peter," said the speaker,
"that the time would come when he would
deny him. Peter replied, 'Though I die
with thee, I will never deny thee." It was
but a brief time after that when Peter
was asked if he were not one of the apos
tiea of Jesus of Nazareth, and he said no.
Such silence, which is practical among the
Christians of to-day, is treason to the con
science, treagon to our religion and
treason to our God. To be good Christians
we must trust ourselves and trust in God.
or otherwise our lives will -be a series of
broken vows." _
The sermon was followed by the bone
diction and the blessed sacrament. There
was special music for the occasion. The
cathedral was crowded.
Another interesting event in Catholic
circles yesterday was the particular coun
cil of the Society of St. Vincent de Baul.
The first general meeting of the year 1900,
Â¦representing all the conferences of San
Francisco, was held yesterday morning :it
7:45 o'clock in the hall of the Church of
St. Francis d'Assisl. Mission Dolores. At
the S o'clock mass the members marche.l
to the church to receive holy communion.
The. conference reassembled in the after
noon, when the term reports were . reud
and other business transacted.
RUSHING THE
LOADINC OF
GRAIN SHIPS
Merchants Eager to Avoid
the Tax on Wheat That '
Is Due To-Day.
TO SAVE A SMALL FORTUNE
Nine Vessels Loaded. Saturday and
the Bush Was to Get Cargoes <
Into Nine More by Mid
night Sunday.
British ships in port chartered to load
wheat were kept busy all of yesterday
and up to midnight. There was a rush to
load them that kept everybody on the
Jump, while the boss stevedores were In a
fever of excitement for fear the rain
would come down and stop the work. The
owners of the wheat were also . on the
tenter hooks, as a shower meant the loss
of several hundred dollars to them. The
State authorities were also Interested,
but they took the matter very philosophi
cally, as the money was. not to come out
of their pockets.
- At midnight of March 4 every merchant
in the State has to make a sworn state
ment of the merchandise he has on hand
and "on which he Is liable for duty. On
wheat the export; rate is about, 2s cents
per ton, and it was to save this tax that
the grain merchants were so anxious to
get the stuff afloat, as once in the hold of
a foreign-bound vessel it is not liable to
be taxed. â¢ . /
Within the past forty-eight hours the
French bark Marie, the British bark Me
rioneth and the British ship Cleomene
have sailed, while in the stream loaded
lie the Peleus, Lyderhorn. Pass of Killia
crankie, Kelburn, Cromdale and Celtic
Monarch. These Vessels carry from 25,000
to 30,000 tons of wheat, the duty on which
would be between $5000 and $6000 were it
only ashore instead of afloat.
It was up around Port Costa that the
rush" was greatest, however, and it Is safe
to say that not a stevedore or longshore
man in that neighborhood saw the Inside
of a church- yesterday. .'At McNear's
there was the Caithness-shire, Canrobert,
Paul Isenberg and Samoena. At Bal
four's there was. the Combermere, 1 Gen
eral Gordon and Godlva, At Eppinger's
was the Clan Graham, and at the Nevada
dock was the Heathfleld. If all these
vessels were loaded last night they took
aboard between 25,000 and 30,000 tons, and
another $5000 or $6000 was saved to the
owners and lost to the Government.' The
entire fleet will probably get away during
the week and there will then be fewer
British and foreign ships in the bay than
there have been in years. In fact, all the
foreigners left in port will be the Bala
sore. Caithness-shire, General Roberts,
Lynton and Reliance. These vessels are
all under charter and will be loaded with
wheat just as soon as their inward cargo
has been discharged.
SWARMS OF DEPUTIES.
Eighty.of Them Will Start Out
From the Assessor's Office .
To- Day.
This morning eighty deputies will start
out from Assessor Dodge's office, to. see
what assessable property the people will
admit having In their possession. It will
not be left to the people altogether, how
ever, for there will be a number of depu
ties whose business it will be to look
around for movable property, such as
grain in the warehouses and car 3 upon the
Southern Pacific tracks. It does not take
lorig to roll a train of cars out of the
county, and the Assessor means to see
that they are tallied as completely as pos
sible before they start away. .
Everything a man owns at 12 o'clock to
day he may be taxed for unless the law
makes an exception. United States bonds
are not taxed and they will go up a point,
for much money will be Invested in them
before 12 to-day. ' Then the purchasers
will swear they hold only untaxable
bonds and that they did not purchase the
bonds to avoid taxation; and then when
the ass><sment has been made against
them 'Aey will sell the bonds again. De
posits/in the .United States Sub-Treasury
will take a sudden Jump, for these de
poi/ts are not taxable, and then after the
u'Zositors have sworn the money, was not
â¢eposited with the Sub-Treasury for thÂ«
purpose of avoiding taxation they will go
and draw it out again. The banks have
'already made their statements to the
Bank Commission, and upon these state
ments their assessments will be largely
based. Their statements to the commis
sion were made last Saturday, and it is to
their interest to make a.s large a showing
as possible before their inspectors; there
fore their statement to the Assessor will
be about right. It is the private individ
ual, however, that the Assessor will have
the hardest time . to- reach. Men with
three or four hundred thousand dollars
out on notes will' not have to pay a cent
ef taxation upon their loans, because they
cannot be located, and millions. of dollars
in stocks and taxable bunds will be over
looked for the same reason. . .'. -. ?. ;
The personal property tax Is the bane
of every civil financial system. It is well
known that in cities the personal property
is fully if not more than equal to the real
property, yet the percentage of collection
is seldom more than 12 per cent as com
pared with, the realty tax. In this city
the percentage, it is said, amounts to 29
per cent, making San Francisco the sec
ond in the collection record in this coun-"
try. â¢ ' - â¢ Â¦*'â¢ ' - ~
"Â¦Deputies have been out for ten days or
more delivering blanks to be filled in by
property owners. This has been done for
the dual purpose of making it more cer
tain that the property is properly listed
and also to hurry the making of the re
turns. Under "the charter the tax levy
will have to be fixed by the last Monday
in June, or before the fiscal year opens,
instead of in September, as formerly. Â¦

ASSAULTS A LAWYER
Henry Hamilton, -who is employed in the
law office of Rodgers, Paterson and Slack,

front of the Hotel Langham, at Ellis and

whom he had seen in the saloon following
them. On observing that ; he was-discov
ered the man rushed up to Hamilton and
struck him with brass knuckles.' Hamil
ton was rendered insensible by the blow,
and when he came to some time after

were gone. Convinced that his 'assailant
was bent on robbing the old man Hamil
ton hurried to police headquarters and in
formed Lieutenant Birdsall of what had
happened: Two . police officers were -* at
once sent to the scene of the assault,.but

A rotten fence gave way early yes
terday and' a man somewhat under
the t influence of liquor was hurled
down the slope to the street seventy feet
below. When picked up the unfortunate
fellow was unconscious, and the people .
who gathered around him thought he was
dead i Sqme wanted to" send him to the
Morgue/ but it "was finally decided to send
him to the Harbor Hospital. The ambu
l lance was called and by the time It ar
rived the man was groaning, but had not
â¢recovered consciousness.
i " When the injured man reached the hos
pital Dr. Bacigalupi made an- examlna
l tlon and found that in sliding down the
hill the man had been lacerated in
'many places. He struck. on the point of
, his chin when he reached the street, and
in consequence his lower jaw was dlslo-
I cated, the end of his. tongue was almost
cut off, there were two long lacerations of
'the scalp and a possible fracture of the
| skull and a rupture of the drum of the
ear. â¢ \

-The .proposition to 'give Lees a testimo
