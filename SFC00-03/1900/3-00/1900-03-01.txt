LONDON, March i, 4:15 a. m. âGeneral Buller's distinct successin storming... PietersVljill
brings the rescue of Ladysmith near, biitthe War Office .intimated late last evening that
immediate announcement of relief need not be expected. The goings to and fro at mld-Â°
night of officials and messengers suggested that important news had been received^ ! If this were
the case Lord Lansdowne obviously desired to sleep on it before taking the'public into his con
fidence. V
As his message reveals, General Buller's successful attack came after the.hard fighting > of
Friday, and it was improvised and its execution begun during the armistice of Sunday.. In pro
posing the armistice the British commander stipulated that both sides should be free to move, but
that neither should do any shooting. He was therefore within his privileges in immediately >be-
General Buller's tidings come weighted with'a long list of casualties. . His losses in J the
four attempts to get General White out aggregate 4000. '
Ladysmith is in desperate straits. Charles Williams, the military expert, says he learns on
very high authority âpresumably that of Lord Wolseley âthat "General White's' force. is almost
at its last gasp." Â¦ .... .... ' ' ., -^~: ..i P

Mr. Williams adds that when news like this passes under thvo thumb of the censor it more-
than offsets whatever jolly news may be heliographed from Ladysmith: -* * \ â¢ .
There is no authoritative indication yet of what Lord Roberts will do next. It seems likely
that a branch railway will be built across the veldt to lessen the difficulties of transportation.
Colonel Girouard, who built the Soudan railway, is with Lord Roberts. t The strain on the. west
ern railway is seen from the fact that the population of Kimberley, two weeks after the relief, con
tinues on reduced rations. Lord Roberts' troops thus far have been only partially fed-
It is quite clear to the technical heads that those who talk of an immediate and rapid ad
vance far intp the Free State do not realize the transport conditions. The Boers, as it now appears,
have built a "railway from Harrismith to Kroomstadt to facilitate the movement of their troops
between Natal and the Free State.
Mafeking was holding out on February 16. At that time the.-Boers were showing unusual
activity and firing inflammable shells. . . : , , '
The Boers who hold positions south of the Orange River have been weakened.
Lieutenant Barentzen, writing on behalf of himself and of other Scandinavian prisoners,
affirms that there are no mercenaries in the Boer army and no volunteers who receive a penny for
their services. . â¢_']
Gibson Bowles, Conservative member of Parliament for Kings Lynn, who was much struck
by the statement of Cecil Rhodesthe other day, that the profits of the De Beers Company last
year were 2,000,000 pounds sterling, and that there are diamonds in 'Kimberley now valued at
167,000 pounds sterling, intends to suggest to Mr. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, that the
rescued property.be distributed among the troops as salvage, or at least be applied to the relief of
the widows and orphans of the iallen.

This i movement was followed by a cessa

Suddenly a regiment stationed on the

burst into cheers, thus first announcing
the surrender of General Cronje.
Shortly! afterward a note reached Lord
Roberts bringing tidings of the Boers' un

face was absolutely impassive, exhibiting,
no sign of his inner feelings.

the war, must end In a British victory
They i had never before believed that the

by railways, and they had supposed that
the efforts to relieve Kimberley were due
to the necessity of securing the Kimber

into the heart of the Transvaal would be

steadily refused to believe it possible that
the British would make a long march
away, from a ; railway, and therefore he
totally misconceived ! the object of the

agining, that it was merely a change of
direction, in order to attack Magersfon

TERRIBLE CONDITIONS
AT THE CAMP OF CRONJE
LONDON, March I.â ln a dispatch from
Paardeberg, dated Tuesday, February 27,
a- staff correspondent says:
"On my first visit to General Cronje's
camp I was admitted Inside, even before
the British guard. At every ten paces- 1
came upon' the swollen carcasses of horses
or mules tainting the air." It seems im
possible that thousands could have ' en
dured, such a .frightful stench. The river
banks were honeycombed with trenches,
such as had never been seen before in
warfare. These were really underground
dwellings. Unless a shell were .to drop
straight down into the opening, It would
not reach the interior. Flat trajectory
projectiles would be bound to fall to reach
them.
: "The Boers were lying or sitting on the
ground. Their faces were haggard and
wan. They said there was not a drop
of spirits in the laager. Every counten
ance showed Joy at the end of the dread
ful qlege. Some of them laughed and said
they hoped they would soon get whisky.
"Nearly all the Free Staters spoke Eng
lish, but there was not a word j about
fighting for liberty, the only expressions
being of Joy over their present deliver
ance. One man. shaking his fist in the
direction of General Cronje, exclaimed :
'That man deserves to be shot.'
â¢'Not a woman or child in the camp had
been hurt, except one girl, who showed
an Injured finger tip. There were heart
rending partings between several men
and their wives, and many of the women
cried bitterly. Several youths of from 16
to 18 years of age were in the camp. The
Transvaalers appeared to have lost their
former truculence."

You know what happens to a sewer
when it becomes clogged, don't you?
Do you know what happens to the
human system when the kidneys be-
come clogged? They are unable to
throw out the impurities from the
blood and become infected with
I'oisons; they decay, fall apart, and
pass out in the urine; the blood, un-
filtered. carries the poison all through
the system and if not checked death
follows. The kidneys are the sewers
of the human system.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work, some of the symptoms
â¢which prove it to you are pain or dull
ache in the back, excess of uric acid,
{Travel, rheumatic pains, sediment in
the urine, scanty supply, scalding Irri-
tation in passing: it, obliged to go often
during the day and to get up many
times during the night to empty the
bladder; sleeplessness, nervous irrita-
bility, dizziness, irregular heart,
breathlessness, callow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the
eyes, sometimes the feet, limbs or body
bloat, loss of ambition, general weak-
ness ar.d debility. Â¦
When you are sick or "feel badly,"
no matter what you think the name of
your disease if, the first thing you
ehould do is to afford aid to your kid-
neys by using Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy.
In takins Swamp-Hoot you afford

REDDING, Feb. 28.â Eight miners
employed in the Iron Mountain
mine, between the Copper and Lane
tunnels, were entombed by an im
mense cave-in this morning. The.
mine is owned and operated by the Moun
tain Copper Company, Limited. Five hun
dred men are employed. Great caverns
had been discovered in the mine, making
it impossible to timber safely, and this
caused the accident.
Of the unfortunates caught by the cave
in two were rescued alive before night.
Those known to be yet imprisoned are:
J. OATES.
A. OATES.
J. M. McBROOM.
A. VAN BUREN.
H. CASTILLION.
R. McCALLIEP.
Within a few minutes after the accident
occurred every available man at the mine
under the personal supervision of Man
ager Lewis T. Wright was toiling to reach
the entombed men. The rescuing party
could hear the Imprisoned miners beating
on the walls. There was great excitement
at the mine, the Keswick smelter and ln
this city. The men were well known at
all these places. Persons having relatives
working in the mine were anxiously in
quiring by telephone and telegraph after
their safety and hundreds hurried to the
scene.

One poor fellow, D. E. Ross, was un
covered at 4 o'clock this afternoon. He
was in a semi-conscious condition. His
external injuries are slight, consisting of
a broken arm and some bad bruises, but
it is believed that he is seriously Injured
internally. Ross was conveyed to the
company s hospital. He has a family liv
ing at Iron Mountain. Besides the com
pany's physician there are physicians
from. Redding at the mine to attend the
men as fast as they are rescued.
At <6 o'clock A. Cavanagh, another
miner, was taken out. ' He is seriously in
jured. A large rock had been resting upon
his head.
Noises are being heard by the relief
workers. They are believed to come from
J. Oates and A. Oates, timbermen, who,
according to the positions occupied by the
workmen just previous to the cave-In,
were Just beyond Cavanagh. The loca
tion of the other four men is unknown.
They may be alive ln some niche formed
by crossed timbers within ten feet , of
where Cavanagh was found. Again, their
lifeless bodies may be found yards distant
from that spot. At 8 o'clock this evening
men acquainted with the mine and the
circumstances surrounding the cave-in
The level is being retlmbered as fast as
the debris is cleared out. In the cases of
both Ross and Cavanagh the men were
raised by an improvised hoist through ore
chutes to the rock level above the copper
level and then brought out.

CANADIAN ROAD
AGREES TO STOP
RATE CUTTING
Victory Gained by the Rep
resentatives of the
American Lines.
Agreement Promptly Entered Into
When a Threat Was Made to'
Establish a Trans-Pacific
Â¦Line of Steamers.
Special Dispatch to The CaU.
CHICAGO, Feb. 28.â The threat of f the
executive officers of the American trans
continental railroads to establish steam
ship lines from the Pacific Coast to the
Orient has induced the Canadian Paoiflo
to abolish the practice of making the
transcontinental freight rate 10 per cent
less than that charged by lines in the
United States.
At the session here tor-day of the execu
tive officers and leading traffic officials of
all the transcontinental lines the Cana
dian Pacific's representatives attempted
to evade the real issue on various pre
texts, while the officers of the American
lines demanded an unequivocal answer to
the question, "Will you strictly, maintain
the same transcontinental rates as we
do?" They declared that unless the Cana
dian Pacific stopped trying to secure dif
ferential rates on traffic originating in the
United States and in some cases destined
to points in it efforts would be made to
secure legislation which would debar the
Canadian Pacific from participating ln
such traffic, and also to establish steam
ship lines to compete with those of the
Canadian Pacific. The last threat moved
effective, and finally the Canadian Pacific
gave satisfactory assurance that it would
stop cutting rates and maintain those of
competing lines to all Paclflo Coast
points. '
The American lines did not bind them
selves to give all freight for the Orient to
the Canadian Pacific steamship lines in
case other lines are established, but the
understanding was that the railroads in
this country would not establish rival
steamship lines.
This is regarded as a victory for the
American lines, and is in reality the first
acknowledgment on the part of the Cana
dian Pacific that the findings of the board
of arbitration at the hearing held in Chi
cago and which resulted against the Cana
dian Pacifio contention shall become ef
fective.
It is believed that this result has been
largely brought about by the determina
tion of the railroads to endeavor to re
spect the rights of one another and that
it has been contributed to some extent
by the action of the Pacific Coast mer-
chants, who have for the past year ac
knowledged the Justice. of the contention
of the Americas transcontinental roads.'
It is also understood that the f fact -that
Congress is in session and is likely to
place certain restrictions on the Canadian
Pacific in case they did not comply more
strictly with the law has had some bear
ing on the matter, v ; . i .

GAMBLERS FROM
SACRAMENTO
Mayor Clark Intends to
Rigidly Enforce the
New Law.
Fool-Sellers Have Already Prepared
to Move Into Yolo County and
Will Endeavor to Evade
the Ordinance.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call. \
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 23.â This is thÂ«
eve of a decisive battle against the pool
rooms. | To-morrow the ordinance recently
enacted for the eradication of the evil
will go into effect. Frank Daroux. one of
the poolroom-owners, has rented Quarters
in Washington, Yolo County, across the
river -from Sacramento, with which com
munication is readily had by bridge. But
Daroux does not figure on the use Of
the bridge to keep up his establishment.
The belief is general that he will make
his headquarters in Yolo and telephone
over the results to Sacramento, where,
under the guise of a commission business
pools on the races will be sold.
But -Mayor Clark is equally determined
to thwart any such effort to defeat the
intent. of the measure which was passed
at the behest of the law-abiding elements
of Sacramento. Meanwhile Yolo County
proposes to have a hand at the game. One
faction in the Bomnolent burg of Wash
ington wants to license the poolrooms and
use the proceeds for the illumination of
the streets, the grading of the highways
and for other affectation of city airs. On
the other hand there is a Btrong ele
ment, especially ln Woodland, against
Yolo County permitting itself to be used
as a sort of back yard for the rubbish dis
carded by Sacramento. â¢
Exciting developments are looked for
to-morrow, since it is believed the pool
sellers will not surrender their profitable
business wlthcfcit a struggle.

Miss Ewald was continually dosing her

mixed with glycerine, she was using as a

jshe thought contained her throat gargle.
Without consulting the label of the vial
the unfortunate woman put the bottle to
her lips and drank of the contents, which
happened to be carbolic acid without tlie
glycerine. The cries of the unfortunate
woman brought the members of her fam
ily to h*r bedside. Two medical studentn.
R. R. Root and R. C. Cholson. who live
in the adjoining house, were summoned
and did all they could for the sufferer,
who lingered for nearly two hours and

"Her husband sltteth ln the gates." This
impressed him because that would seem
to be all that was necessary for a man
having such a wife. He would have no
other place to go when she was house
cleaning.
ROMANCE IN
THE LIFE OF
MRS. BARNES
Weds First Husband in Paris
Where She Was Known
as a Beauty.
MEETS GENERAL IN : DENVER
Comes to San Francisco to Attend
Knights Templar Convention.
Second Marriage Follows
. j Divorce in the Bast.
Â¦ â¢ '-+Â¦ â â '
THE marriage of General "William H.
L. Barnes to Mrs. Anna M. Scott,
telegraphed from the East Tues
day evening, was the ruling topic
of conversation in San Francisco
clubs yesterday afternoon. To all but a
very limited chosen few the announce
ment came as an utter surprise, and eren
those who knew of the general's matri
monial intentions and his unshaken at
tachment for Mrs. Scott were in complete
Ignorance of the romantic incidents which
mark the association of both parties to
the marriage . .;-..'rV
From the first meeting to the final, con
summation there is hardly an episode in
the life of the two that is not tinctured
with the colors of romance. Their ac
quaintanceship began with a railroad
.Journey. Then followed an association
which was characterized by the slow,
sober and, staid pace of a friendship of
people in the fall of life. Love, more ar
dent and with a quicker beat, came in
train. Still faster, was the consummation
when General Barnes and his present
bride were railroaded across the continent
and in New York City became husband
and wife.
All Bohemia â at least the bachelor end
of itâ is mourning its loss; yet at the same
time congratulations are speeding across
wires to the' mariicd ccnple. General
Barnes numbers his friends by the host,
and wherever he appeared, on the forum,
the political rostrum or in a corner of his
favorite club, surrounded b.' his friends,
he was always the favorite. ''Â¦ ;",â¢';;Â¦ .'-'
Famous for Her Beauty.
While the association of General Barnes
and Mrs. Scott is replete with incidents
of color, light and shade, the real Interest
centers in the Hfe of the newly made
bride. Early in the sixties an American
woman known as Mme. Welsh was estab
lished ln Paris and was well known to the
American colony. She had two daughters,
one of whom, "Marie Antoinette," a girlof
14 at that time, was famous for her child
like beauty and was the talk of all Amer
icans who made the French capital their
temporary home. Frank Scott, a young
architect of Toledo, Ohio, was then study
ing art in Paris and took up his residence
with Mme. Welsh.
His Parisian . education' finished, Scott
returned to his native city, but he did
not forget the fair face of "Marie Antoi
nette." Paris and its associations still
clung fast to his memory and he returned
to Europe, this time to bring "Marie An
toinette Welsh back to Toledo as his
bride. In that city Mr. and Mrs. Scott
lived the life of people of fashion, the
husband acquiring a clientele in his pro
fession that proved both remunerative ;
and socially advantageous. Occasionally
Mrs. Scott would take trips either to the
East or California. . .
First Met in Denver.
Mrs. Scott's meeting ' with General
Barnes was accidental. . In 1883, at ; the
time of the Knights Templar crusade to
this city for their grand triennial conclave,
Mr. and Mrs. Scott were in ' the party.
General Barnes, chosen asa delegate to
receive the 'visitors, went to Denver to
meet the advance guard. There he. was
introduced to the Scotts and on the trip
west passed most of his time in their
company. Captivated by Mrs. Scott's
charm and brilliancy, the general per
suaded both husband and wife to be his
guests during their stay in San Francisco.
All the hotels at this time being packed
with the army of visitors who came to
the coast for. the convention. General
Barnes' invitation was graciously ac
cepted. . â¢
The convention over, Frank Scott re
turned East, but his wife remained in this
city, living at the Palace at first and sub
sequently- at a private hotel on Sutter
street. General Barnes' and Mrs. Scott's
acquaintance had ripened into a friend
ship and the. two saw very. much of each
other. ;.-v'.'.
Scott Gets a Divorce. X; t [\
Three years 'after the celebrated en
campment of the Knights Templar, Scott
secured a divorce from his wife in To
ledo. He Is now living in Buffalo, a man
of hlÃh position and reputed to jbe very
wealthy.
Mrs. Scott, save for short journeys, con
tinued to make this city her residence.
Then came the death of Mrs. Barnes a
few years ago. Shortly after the general
had laid his wife to her eternal rest his
affection . for Mrs. Scott asserted it
self. To those who knew them well
but one ending to their romantic Â¦ at
tachment was expected. Both of General
Barnes; sons knew of the attachment and
were on moat friendly terms with Mrs.
Scott. William S. was the recipient of
many conpratulations . yesterday. The
other son John Is now a commissioned
officer, fighting the Filipinos for Uncle
Sam. The marriage had been expected by
them for many months.
In a few days the general and his bride
will arrive in San Francisco. His friends
are now in the midst of preparations to
seal his romance with a fitting welcome.

POLICE BOARD APPOINTS
A NEW DRILL MASTER
Ex-Sergeant Major Gaughran of the
Regular Army Captures
the Plum.
Andrew J. Gaughran, ex-sergeant maior
of the Third Artillery, U. S. A., was last
evening appointed drill master of the Po
lice Department at a special meeting of
the Police Commissioners. He was ordered
to report for duty to-day.
The new drill master, was a member of
the regular army for over ten years and
was favorably mentioned for his bravery
ln leading' a platoon of fifty men in an
assault before Manila. He was warmly
indorsed for the position of drill masttr
of the department by Chief Sullivan and
several officers of the regular army.
Mrs. .'Wright and Mrs. Fabian were ap
pointed matrons of the City Prison. Mrs.
Wright has occupied the position for some
time and on account of her strict attention
to her duties she is held in high esteem
by the prison officials.
K. Conway was appointed secretary of
the Police Relief and Pension Commis
sion.
The board deeded not to give its con
sent to the presentation of an elaborate
testimonial to ex-Chief of Police Lees.
Shortly after the latter's retirement from
th? service several members of the de
partment formed themselves Into a com
mittee and arranged to present the ex-
Chief with a suitable testimonial. An ar
tistic tribute to the worth they held him
in wag prepared at a cost of $350. \*hich
came from the i-ockets of the members of
the force.- The Commissioners were ai>
prlted of the testimonial and asked to
give their consent to its presentation.
After a brief discussion the board decided
not to give Its official sanction, as such a
course would be in direct violation of on-;
of the provisions of the charter.
The proposition to reorganize the detec
tive force was not taken up, and Chief
Sullivan is engaged in comparing the
records of his sleuths with a view
of strengthening the "upper office." The
aduUional detectives allowed by the new
charter will not be appointed for some
time, owing to the lack of funds.
ADVEKTISEMENTS.
V^HjXps Farmers
T^jEXgg and
Furrows
A fanner is known by his furrow as
" the carpenter is known Sy his chips." It
takes a firm hand and a true eye to turn
a straight furrow. No wonder the farmer
â¢wears out, spite of exercise and fresh air.
One day's work on the farm would tire
many a trained athlete. And the farmer
works hardest of all. The first up and
the last to bed, feeding his team before
he feeds himself, his work is practically
never done. Why does not the farmer
treat his own body as he treats the land
he cultivates? He puts back in phos-
phate what he takes out in crops, or the
land would grow poor. The farmer
6hould put back into his body the vital
elements exhausted by labor. If he does
not, he will soon complain of "poor
health." The great value c-f Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery is in its vital-
izing power. It gives strength to the
stomach, life to the lungs, purity to the
blood. It supplies Nature with the sub-
stances by which she builds up the body,
just as the farmer supplies Nature with
the substances that build up the crops.
Â¦ I write to tell you of the great benefit I re-
ceived from the use of Dr. Pierces Golden Med-
ical Discovery." writes Mr. G. B. Bird, of Bjtc-

He advised me to try the "Golden Medical Dis-

FAIR TOLD
HER OF HIS
MARRIAGE
Mrs. Craven-Fair's Daughter
Objected to It Being Kept
From the Public.
SENATOR ASKED FOR TIME
Said He and Her Mother Were as
Much Man and Wife as Though
the Ceremony Were Cried 1
From the Housetops*.
..";'Â¦;"- * '*>' Â¦
Mrs. Margaret Craven-Koehler testified
in behalf of her mother yesterday ln the
Craven-Fair litigation, now pending be
fore Judge Troutt. There waa a simpli
city about her manner and an entire
frankness about her general demeanor
that at once created the impreÃslon that
she was telling a straight, truthful and
unvarnished tale of the relations said to
have existed between her mother and the
late Senator Fair. '
If her story is true her testimony would
go a long way toward proving absolutely
that Mrs. Craven-Fair is the widow of
the dead millionaire and therefore entitled
to a share of his vast estate. It is hard
to believe that one who so completely dis
arms, suspicion as to her veracity and who
is so charmingly simple in her manner
isms is a conspirator ln league with her
mother to plunder an estate upon which
they have no legal claim.
If she is all that the Fair attorneys hint
she is they can make up their minds after
their experience of yesterday that she is
one of the most dangerous subjects with
which they will have to deal.
Charmed Attorney Pierson.
Eliminating any suggestion as to the
truth or falsity of Mrs. Koehler's story,
she was an ideal witness. Even Attorney
Pierson, who has conducted the cross
examination for the Fair side of the liti
gation, treated her with marked consid
eration. Once or twice when he evinced
a disposition to be unduly severe ln his
questions she -swayed him from his pur
pose with a smile or completely discon
certed him with a little by-play of words.
There was considerable comedy ln the
proceedings yesterday, especially when
the witness was being cross-examined as
to her theatrical career. Asked what
company she was connected with during
the latter part of 1593 she took time to
refresh her memory and then without cal
culating the effect her answer might have
on the Judge and the audience she frankly
replied:
"Oh, now I know. I played with 'Tne
Other Man' that year."
"And how long did 'The Other Man'
last?" inquired Mr. Pierson.
"He did not last very long; he was not
very successful." By this time the court
room was In an uproar.
At another time she stated she was
playing in "Settled Out of Court." Mc-
Enerney suggested the subject was hara
on the lawyers, but easy "on the Judge.
"Was there a mother represented in that
piece?" inquired Mr. Pierson.
"Or a trustee?" added Lafe Pence, with
a great deal of sarcasm.
Resents an Insinuation.
Much that Mrs. Koehler wanted to tell
about the Craven-Fair marriage was not
admitted in evidence. The Judge would
not permit her to relate any of the con
versation between herself and mother
concerning the contract or. the circum
stances under which it was shown her.
She testified that she had known Sena
tor Fair as far back as she could remem
ber anything. The contract was identitled
and the witness said she saw it for the
first time in June, 1892, when her mother
handed it to her In New York City.
.Arguing against the admission of evi
dence on the conversation that occurred
between the witness and Mrs. Craven-
Fair at the time. Attorney McEnerney
took occasion to refer to the "bogua
widow clause" in the Fair will whicn was
recently the subject of a Supreme Court
decision. This aroused the anger of Mrs. .
Koehler, and she resented the lawyer's
remark.
"Senator Fair did not write that clause,
Mr. McEnerney, and I know it," she
snapped, and by way of emphasis stamped
her foot on the floor.
Much legal quibbling resulted from Mr.
McEnerney's objection, but the Judge
finally ruled his way. Attorney Pence of
fered to prove by the witness that ac far
back as 1892 Mrs. Craven-Fair had t>>W
her daughter of the Sausalltq ceremony,
and said his purpose was to" contradict
the statement that the story was a con
spiracy of recent hatching. Judge Troutt.
however, stayed with his ruling. Â¦ and
would not admit the testimony. .
Fair Admitted the Marriage.
VI returned to California during the lat
ter part of 1832," continued the witnesr.
"I saw Senator Fair -a few days later in
our apartments. I remember it as dls-7
tinctly as though It were yesterday. Ho
stepped up to me and, extending his hand,
said: 'How do you like your new father?"
I replied that I did not like the idea of
secrecy, and refused to shake hands with
him. He told ire It would be all right ln
a little while, and so it would have been
had he lived. I remember also that ho
said he and mother were as much man
and wife as though it were cried from the
housetops."
According to Mrs. Koehler, Senator Fair
offered her money and letters of credit on
many occasions, but she never accepted.
She visited once at his office to get him to
sign a document for her mother. When
she first entered he was overjoyed that
she took enough Interest ln the "old man"
to visit him. and was greatly disappointed
when he learned that she called on busi
ness.

witness stand when the case is called this

Special Dispatch 'to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb.' 28.â Excitement over the
tragic death of Bessie Evans and the train
of sensations following it has not sub
sided in the least. The residents of the
little town of Madera,- including mer
chants, bankers, business and professional
men, women and even children have but
one topic of conversation and that is the
death of the popular waitress. The ghost
oflittle Bessie Evans will .: not. down. ii/.C
Louis Kutner, the young man whom the
citizens' mass-meeting denounced as be
ing responsible for the girl's death, was
on close terms with the waitress, but no
body suspected that their relations were
more than those of ordinary friendship.
He talked to her frequently and she, hav
ing a bright word for all, usually replied
ln a light vein.
Conversation Overheard.
The true story of the suicide brought
out many facts not heretofore published.
Bert Bliss, who was sleeping in a room
adjoining Kutner's, heard a. scream and
some one say, "Lou,- I've done it." The
next instant he heard Kutner say, "My
God, Bessie, what have you done?" The
girl had swallowed the deadly carbolic
acid and made her way, aresseu in night
clothes and with bare feet, from her own
room to Kutner's. This was early in the
morning. I
Friends Called "Buzzards."
The feeling against the young man re
sulted in a meeting of - women at which
little was said or done. Next day the
Weekly Times appeared, and in a column,
under the: heading of "Snapshots," re
ferred to the women who held the meeting
and other friends of the dead girl as -"A
gang of human buzzards."-.
In the same column the paper declared
that Miss Evans was not the first girl
that had died for love and would not.be
the last. Further on it advised the gos
sips "of both the hemale and . shemale
variety" not. to express opinions deroga
tory of their neighbors.
The publication in the Times was the
first printed comment on the suicide and
it. goaded the friends of the girl and the
women of the town almost to desperation.
They could no. longer conceal their pent
up indignation. The pastors of the town.
Rev. W. B. McElwee of the Presbyterian
Church. Rev. W. S. Phillips of the Meth
odist Church and Rev. D. Jenks of the
Episcopalian Church, preached sermons
upon the suicide and the movement the
women were making to set a better moral
standard for the community. The man
who betrayed the Innocent and confiding
confidence of a young girl and he who
condoned were denounced In unsparing
terms. In his pulpit Mr. McElwee was
unsparing ln his expression of contempt
for the paper which sought to condone
an uncondonable offense and so viciously
outraged the moral sense of every decent
man and woman in the town. , In all the
pulpits . announcements were made . of
Monday evening's meeting and : the con
gregations were urged to attend and lend
their support.'
Meeting of Citizens.
The meeting was attended by many of
the leading citizens of Madera and was
thoroughly representative. Â¦ The Presby
terian Church was crowded to the doors
and people who could not secure admis
sion stood outside in the hope of hearing
what was said. The resolutions condem
natory of Kutner and J. E. Nugent, edi
tor of the Times, were adopted /without
opposition. -
. Nugent is taking an active interest in
Kutner's defense and claims that he has
secured â¢ affidavits ; from - reputable physi
cians to prove from a medical standpoint
that Kutner is free from blame. Accord
ing to the statements of the physicians
themselves, however, the affidavits are
not conclusive. Nugent says the mass
meeting was intended to ruin him. Kut
ner's'friends say there has been no evi
dence of a positive : nature to show that
he was in any way responsible ,for the
death of the girl. They say the notes
written by her do not indicate anything
more than love for Kutner.
Kutner has not yet returned to Madera,
The excitement is growing rather than
subsiding. r Threats are openly made on
the streets. : The sentiment of the com
munity is undoubtedly very strong against
Kutner and Nugent.^
KUTTNER DENIES
ALL RESPONSIBILITY
Leon Kutner came to San . Francisco
nearly, a week ago to attend the wedding
of his sister, which was celebrated last
Sunday, and he' is still in town. While
naturally disturbed over the charges
against . .him he i declares 'Â¦ he was never
anything more than a good 'friend to the
girl -who ' is said to have taken her life
because of her; love for him. '
"I 'had â¢ known Miss Evans for about a
year," said Mr. Kutner yesterday, "and
always considered her a respectable, vir
tuous i girl, and her : untimely death -; has
caused no change in my opinion. There
was never any , talk of ; love between us,
however, and my relations with her were
only those of a friend. She was of; a
somewhat melancholy disposition and
often said she would like to get out of the
hotel business because people looked down
on her as a waitress. I told her it was no
disgrace' to be a waitress and tried to
cheer her up. About a week before this
thing occurred . she told me she had de
cided to kill -herself. I- talked her out of
the idea, for good, as I , thought. Â¦ Bhe
asked me .to take charge of .her money
and I did so. after trying- to r get her to
place It in the bank. I think she gave me
$60 and afterward drew $5. . , ?. ,
report printed in the papers this
morning to Â¦ the effect that . she had ad
dressed a letter and a poetic quotation to
me before - swallowing the poison* . Is < not
entirely correct.; The letter probably was
addressed to me, although I have not seen
it. The poetry she had. copied from some
publication a week or. two previous to her
death and > she . showed Â¦; it -toy me \ at :- that
"I repeat I never had any relations with
the girl â¢ except â¢ those of t friendship. V She
waa a good girl and the only reason ' I
can assign Â¦ for her act -is 1. that f of de
spondency resulting from continual brood
ing over her > position ln society." â

however, that the San Francisco Gas and

; Uor. to give rates. E. J. Martin volun
teered this lnfoimatlon. and with it ir-e
i entire Inquiry ended, the committee of the
j whole adjourning to await the report of
j the light committee of the board, and to
j fix rates.
President Crockett Protests.
j The ordinance fixing the minimum
j standard quality and illuminating -power
!of gas. and the maximum price to be
! charged, tÂ«.s read at the evening session.
i President Crockett obtained permission to
' address tho board, and entered a strong
; protest against the adoption of the order,
i Up s>a!d that during the investigation no
: testimony whatever was taken on strset
i lighting, its cost or anything about it, and
i he wanted to enter his protest against the
; rate hxed by the board.
, The Mayor attempted to defend the
I committee, but Mr. Crockett hotly replied
1 that the Mayor never asked about the
j care of the lamps, the cost of the glass.
j the etreei signs that the gas company was
called upon to place on each lamp, and
| in fact the board had not taken up the
I question of street lamps. In closing. Mr.
| Crockett vehemently said that he pio
i tested against the rate on the ground that
! the board had not investigated the sub
! Ject.
; Despite his protest, the following ordi
nance was passed to print with but ore
dissenting vote, and that was recorded by
Supervisor Tobln:
Bill No. â . Ordinance So. â . Fixing the
minimum standard quality and Illuminating

Brandenstein Grows Sarcastic.
Supervisor Brandenstein, after thinking
the matter over, felt Ihat he had taken a
wrong stand on the foregoing ordinance
and bepged a reconsideration on the
ground that the lamp lighting referred to
by Mr. Crockett had not been investi
gated. A vote was taken and Mr. Bran
densteln's motion was lost. Nothing
daunted, he asked leave to change his vote
to no. He said that while he was satis
fied with the SI 40 rate he was not satis
fied with fixing the rate for gas lamps at
9 cÂ£nts.
Supervisor R?ed objected to Mr. Bran
densteln's course of procedure and cast a
Plight on the latter's knowledge of parlia
mentary rules. Supervisor Brandenstein
evidently disliked to be reproved and he
said:
"Well. I withdraw my request. Some
of us make mistake's; Mr. Reed does not."
The following ordinance fixing the maxi
mum rate and price to be charged for ln
cana>seent and electric lights and for
HÂ«Â»ctriolty for heat and power purposes

DICKINSON RESIGNS AS
AUDITOR WELLS' COUNSEL
Gives His Reason in a Letter to the
City Official â Reuben H. Uoyd
May Be Appointed-
It Is not always the unexpected that
happens. There are many good reasons
for the impression that the following let
ter to Auditor Asa R. Wells from General
John H. Dickinson was expected:
Hon. A. R. 'Wells, Auditor. San Francisco.
My Dear Sir: It has come to my kaowleds*
that you arÂ« being criticised for employing me
as your attorney, because I am a resident of
Marie County, and not wishing to embarrass
you In any particular. I beg leave to and da
hereby tender my resignation as your attorney,
to take effect immediately. I thank you for
your kind consideration In the past, and trust
that our relations may always continue to be
as pleasant as they hare been. IT I can Â«ervÂ«
you in any way at any time in the future. I
shall be very glad to do so. With best wishes
for your success, officially I and otherwise. I
am yours very truly, ; JOHX H. DICKINSON.
On the face of the foregoing proposition
one not familiar with the subtletle3 of the
political world might infer that the resig
nation was a voluntary sacrifice on the"
general's^art toshfeld lhe"AÂ«dilor from
criticism. The friends of General Dickin
son, however. Insist that he received a
direct intimation that the resignation
would - be highly acceptable to Auditor
Wells. The fact Is considered that Gen
eral Dickinson was a resident of Maria
County, having a law office In San Fran
cisco at the time he was selected as legal
adviser of the Auditor and since that time
he has not changed his residence or pro
fession.
As a State Senator representing Marln
and Contra Costa counties In the Legisla
ture, he did not feel Justified In casting bi3
vote for United States Senator In favor
of D. M. Burns. The friends of the Marin
Senator have no hesitation In asserting
that Dickinson was Invited to resign, not
because he resided In Marin County, but
because he did not cast a vote for Bums.
S Auditor Wells was seen last evening 1 and
acknowledged "that the resignation had
been previously discussed between him
self and General Dickinson. The Auditor
could not name any person who criticised
Dickinson or objected to the Marin resi
dence. He asserted, however, that the
vote cast In the Legislature by Dickinson
had nothing to do with tva affair. To
make good the assertion t iat Burns and
the railroad had no hand ; ?Â» the business,
he paid that he had in view the appoint
ment of Reuben H. Lloyd to succeed Gen
eral Dickinson. .
SCHOOL BOARD INDORSES

THE Supervisors followed their re
duction jat water rates last night
by m&kir.g material reductions in
the rates for gas and establish
ing, for the firet time in the his
tory of the city, rates for lncan
descect and arc electric lighting. Gas
rates to private consumers were reduced
from $1 50 a thousand cubic feet to $1 45 a
thousand cubic feet and for the city and
public buildings the rates were allowed to
remain as they are, at $1 25 a thousand
cubic feet. For street lights the rate will
be S cents a lamp instead of 11 cents,' the
prevailing rale. The gas must be cf sev
enteen candle power, this low standard

tion which has marked the inquiry in re

Hunt's Sliding Scale.
A. M. Hunt, engineer and general man

to explain his suggested sliding scale of
rate* for electric lighting. Mr. Hunt came
armed with a chart and elaborate expla*.

Big Increase in Values.
. When asked why thÂ« city Bhould fes
asked to pay interest on property which Is
not in use for purposes of water supply,
Schussler replied that the system muÂ»t
necessarily provide for future necessities
and development as well as present needs.
It is only a question of time, he declared,
before the city will own the Spring Valley
Water ComDany or some other water
company and every foot of land now held
will oe nefded and valuable.
Supervisor Brandenstein insisted that
the Clear Lake property could not be con
sidered in any way a necessary part of the
system and tnerefore should not bear in
terest. The company should have dis
posed of this property long ago and ap
plied the proceeds to Its indebtedness.
Schussler replied that it is not easy to dis
pose of property at will and he believed
that In fairness the- company should be
Kl\ - en time in which to sell the property
with the .understanding that every effort
will be made to do so.
In connection with the valuation of $1000
an acre placed on reservoir sites. Attor
ney Kellogg asked leave to offer the testi
mony of City Engineer Grunsky, given on
the point in an action for condemnation
proceedings. In that suit Grunsky gave
an expert opinion that land "wanted by
the Spring Valley Water Company at
Crystal Springs was worth $1250 an acre.
This opinion, which when given was
against the company, was now decidedly
in its favor, the attorney admitting that
the company wanted to give $250 an acre
as its real. estate value, but the court in
siÃted that the property should be valued
as a part of a water supply system. This
is now the contention of the company in
asking for a- valuation upon Its Interest
bearing property.
Mayor Phelan suggested that perhaps
the Crystal Springs property possessed a
value as a villa site.
"Perhaps it did," was Kellogg's reply.
"It would have been excellent for the 10~
cation of a balloon. -
The Supervisors again wanted to know
how.lt was that the operating expenses
had so greatly increased in 1539, and Mr.
Schussler declared that the Increase, was
largely due to the Increased expenses of
pumping caused by successive dry sea
sons. "If you cut our rates," he declared,
"you will cripple us. This will result in
danger and Injury and the responsibility
will be upon you." Â¦. -
Colonel yon Schmidt Testifies.
During .the afternoon session colonel A.'
W. yon Schmidt became a witness at the
invitation of the Mayor. The witness re
cited in some detail his own figures on
the value of the property of the Spring
Valley Water Company. He made an es
timate several years ago and decided that
the property was worth $13.642,000. ' Since
then the records of the company show
that $5,000,000 has been expended in im
provements. Accepting these figures as
correct. Colonel yon Schmidt declared
that the property which the company val
ues at over $30,000,000 is really worth $IS,
642.000. He asserted also that Schussler
had accepted his estimates as correct, an
assertion to which Schussler voiced a
most emphatic protest. He claimed that
he had objected to many of the -figures
on the ground that valuable properties
had not been considered at all. " .
The witness then declared that a supply
can be obtained from Lake Tahoe in a
single pipe for $15,000,000. This does not
include a distributing system, which will
cost $3,000,000 more. If a two-pipe system
were established from Lake Tahoe it
would, in the opinion, cost twice as much.
With this announcement the entire In
quiry ended. The board decided to meet
again at 7:30 o'clock to establish the. rates.
The Water Committee had been in session
during the recess and expected to be
ready at night to submit Its conclusions.
Schussler's Final' Flea,
"When the board met for the evening
session Mr. Schussler arose and asked to
be heard:
Mayor Phelan said It would bÂ© out of
order as the board was ready to listen to
the report; that testimony was all In and
every one had been given a hearing. 'Mr.-
Schussler was so earnest in his endeavor
to be beard, however, that the, chairman
asked if there would be any objection to
listening to him, and nona being heard the
water company's expert was allowed to
proceed. .
"I saw In one- of the evening papers,"
he said, "that a protest had been sent to
the Committee Â¦on Fire Department
against the removal of ICO hydrants. The
board has asked for 160 hydrants in addi
tion to those which have been ordered re
moved. The latter order was made during
December last but we have delayed their
removal. We are ready to cut them out.
What Is your pleasure about their, re
moval? If the ratÂ© is allowed to remain
as it has been, .we will leave them in un
til the next fiscal year, when we expect
to be paid for them. If you reduce the
rate, which I hope you will. not. we will
be compelled largely to discontinue the
work of highway, which was the laying of
a pipe line for the benefit of the Fire De
partment. We had it In view to go on
with a fair ratio of that work, but if the
rates are cut we cannot do It."
As soon, as the speaker concluded the'
Mayor directed the clerk to. read the re
port of the committee. This was done,
the ordinance was passed to print and .the
discussion of water was over.
THE Supervisors have at last fixed
the rates for water consumption
which will prevail for the fiscal year
beginning on July L? After a long
inquiry the board adopted last night
the much discussed schedule, in which the
rates for the city government are left un
touched and the charges for private con
sumers receive a horizontal reduction of
10 per cent. The summary of the schedule
as submitted by Supervisors Connor, Jen
nings and A. Comte Jr., the water com
mittee, and adopted by the board, is as
follows:
Pursuant to section 14, chapter 2, artlcl* 1,
of tbe charter, which provides teat the Board
of SuDervlbors shall sflx, in the month of Feb
ruary of each year, the rates to be collected
by any person or corporation In the city for
the use of water, we beg to report the sub
joined schedule, which we recommend for adop
tion by the board. It will be observed that the
reduction proposed Is 10 per cent of the general
rates, meter rates and other rates now charged
by the Spring Valley Water Works, excepting
the rates for supplying water to the shipping
and the rates charged aeainet the city and
county. This effects a reduction to' the rate
payers of the city of approximately J154.0G0. and
a corresponding diminution In the company's
revenue on the basis' of last year's rates.
This schedule will enable the company to pay
iv taxes, its reasonable operating expenses, in
terest on its bonds and a fair dividend on Its
etock. We have taken into consideration all
the evidence adduced at the investigation, and
we believe that the- revenue under this order
will realize s per cent upon the true value of
the company's property.
We estimate that these reduced rates, with
the natural increase of the company's business,
will yield 51. 250.000 for Interest and dividends.
We have recommended a horizontal reduction
because wÂ« believe that all the classes of con
sumers are entitled to the benefit that will ac
crue therefrom and because the company has
failed to show us the aggregate amount re
ceived from each class of consumers.
When the votÂ« was taken Supervisor
Fontana was ebsent. It was explained
that he is out of the State on leave. All
of the other members of the board, except
Supervisor McCarthy, voted for the ordi
nance and he explained his negative vota
by saying-that he believed that the rates
should have been established much lower
than they were. The vote was taken after
a day of interesting proceedings.
Spring Vallej Bealtj.
The inquiry opened yesterday with Her-
Mann Schussler, the chief engineer of the
Spring Valley Water Company, on . the
witness stand. His testimony was devoted
very largely to an estimation of the value,
of the real estate of the company, consid
ered in its aspect of a system of properties
devoted to a specific purpose. From thU
point of view, and the testimony of
Schussler was supported by the sworn evi
dence of .Engineer Grunsky In another
matter, the real property of the Spring
Valley Water Company, which is being
used specifically for supplying water, is
$]2.030.0u0. Â¦'Â¦: . .
Schussler wanted it to be distinctly un
derstood that this Included nothing aot
used In the water-supply system. Nor
did he wish this. valuation to b? confused
with his opinion that the entire value of
the Spring Valley Water^Company prop
erty is over $3Q.w0,00O t and probably could
not be purchased for $35,<W9,0v0.
In opening his testimony, Mr. Schusslor
related what had been done in reference
to the plea of residents of Bernal Heights
and the SunEet Heights district for water
and 'fire protection. He declared that he
had gone over the ground in both ca.3es
and was ready to report that the company
Is ready and will Bupply Bernal Heights
with water whatever tne city authorities
may do in regard to fire protection. He
declared that the company will put in a
four-inch pipe line, but this will not give
fire protection. If the company can be
assured of six hydrants in the district It
will put in an eight-inch pipe line and
take its chances on the city shutting olf
hydrants somewhere else.
In reference to the Sunset Heights dis
trict, which is south of Golden Gate
Park, the witness declared that the dli
trlct is greatly . developed and the com
pany is ready to put In an eight-inch pipe
line If the city will grade three blocks o.i
one of the streets and give a guarantee In
reference to hydrants within reasonable
limits.
Householders Who Use Water.
Mayor Phelan asked Mr., Schussler if he
could give the board some idea of the
number of consumers occupying one-story,
two-story, three-story, four-story, or flve
story houses. Schussler replied that he
could not, but >he gave the following
enumeration of families: Â° One-story
houses, 16,502: two-story houses, 34.61j;
three-story houses, 10,441; four-story
houses, 373; five-story houses, 25; total,
61.561 families. Tha Mayor asked his ques
tion; he eald, to avoid forcing the board's
making a horizontal Increase or decrease
in rates.
Engineer Schussler then turned to the
main theme of his testimony, the value of
the real estate and some of - the Improve
ments of tho Spring Valley Water Com
pany. He declared that reservoirs in cit
ies cost, without price of real estate, $50,000
an acre, white in country places they, cost
T2500, just twenty times less. The witness
then enumerated In detail the various
properties of the company, giving his esti
mate of their values. In outline these es
timates were as follows: San Mateo Coun
ty, 23i0 acres at -JlOOO an acre, $2,340,000;
water sbeds 17,300 acres at $100 an acre,
$1,730,000; water rights. $(WO,000; total. $4,
670.000. Alameda County, 1550 acres at $1000
an acre, reservoir site, $1,350,000; 3SOO acres
water sheds at I100Â«n acre, $380,000; water
rights. $1,000,000; total. $2,730,000. San Fran
cisco County, water sheds, 21S0 acres at
$1000 an acre, $2.1S0, 000; reservoir, ' Lake
Merced, 450 acres at $1000 an acre, $450,000;
Point Lobos, Richmond property, $500,000;
other real estate In the city, reservoirs,
offices, etc., $1,500,000; total. $4,630,000. Re
capitulation, in 'totals, San Francisco, $4,-
C 30.000; San Mateo, $4.<>70.000; Alameda.
$2,730,000; grand total. $12,030,000.
Schussler declared that while the San
Mateo property had- been purchased for
much less than It Is now estimated it
should be considered now as a water pro
ducer and .water container near a big
city; This property has a storage capac
ity of 2500 million gallons of water and a
daily capacity of two million gallons of
water. He declared that in previous years
the cost to build had been considered and
now the present value should be allowed.
.He asserted also that the property of. the
company not in actual use will not exceed
$300,000 In value. In -this Is Included prop-

It is important that the Republicans

It is essential, in view of the importance

The Health Board last night passed res

members of the board earlier in the day
and had decided to allow it the sum of.
J4Â«00 for the Harbor Emergency HospitaL
Certain unexpended balances amounting
to some JiOuO had been discovered, whicn
would be used for the maintenance of the
Central Emergency and Insane Detention
hospitals. The balanca left from .the orig
inal $20,000 appropriated by the board,
amounting to about VÂ£tf>. would be utilized
for other expenses, and the Health Board
was compelled to dismiss all its employes
except tne assistant secretary, clerk to
the health officer, stenographer, chief
plumbing inspector, messenger, chief
sanitary inspector and chief plumbing In
spector.
As soon as the resolutions had been
adopted Health Officer O'Brien arose and
in a neat speech volunteered his services

4PORTO RICAN
BILL PASSED
IN THE HOUSE
Republicans Victorious by a
Vote of 172 Ayes to
161 Noes.
DE VRIES SUPPORTS TARIFF
Srownlow of Tennessee Arises From
a Bed of Sickness to Stand
With His Party's
Leaders.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. 28.â The battle
royal over the Porto Rican tariff bill end
ed in the House to-day in a sweeping
\lctory for tha Republicans. The bill was
amended as agreed upon at the conference
cf Republicans on Monday night, so as to
reduce the tariff from 25 to 15 per cent of
the American tariff and limit its life to
two years, and was passed by a vote of
172 ayes to 161 noes. Six Republicansâ
Crumpaeker of Indiana. Fletcher of Min
nesota. Heatwole of Minnesota. Littlefleld
of Maine, Lorimer of Illinois and McCall
of Massachusettsâ voted with the opposi
tion against the bill; and four Democrats
â Davey and Meyer of Louisiana. De Vries
of California and Sibley of Pennsylvania
âVoted with the Republicans for the bill.
In addition, Warner, (H.) of Illinois paired
against the bill with Boutelle. (it.) of
Maine for it. Two other Republicansâ
J^ane of lowa and Karris of Indianaâ were
absent and unpaired. They were under
stood to he against the bill. Four Demo
crats, who were opposed to the bill â
r]Â»*mir.R; of Georgia. Small of Xorth Caro
lina, Smith of Kentucky and Stallings of
Alabamaâ wr-re absent and unpaired.
Alter votiiijr, Mr. de Vries made this
statement: "I cast my vote in accordance
with what I detm to be for the best in
terest of the district I have the honor to
represent and the best interests of the
State of California."
Herculean efforts had been made to get
olu the full vote and this led to some re
markable incidents. Six men were brought
from beds of sickness, two of them from
hospitals. Browr.low of Tennessee was
brought in a carriage, accompanied by his
wife and a physician, lie sat bundled up
near :he entrance until his vote was given
and Lben withdrew. It was felt that the
Ft rain would be revere upon him. but
when Tawney, the Republican whip, urged
that the bill might be lost by this one
vote, Hrownlow said:
"1 would rather lose my life than see
this bill defeated."
Tawney and three assistants were out
in carriages until midnight la?t night ac
counting for every vote, and Underwood,
\Y\f Democratic whip, was similarly ex
erting every means to g<-t out his vote.
Three Democrats were brought from sick
beds.
The first test to-day was on a substitute
offer^<i by McCall on behalf of the oppo
piiion. It was the original Payne bill for
free trade with Porto Rico and was de
bated. 10D to 174. Only live Republicans
voted for the substitute. Fletcher (R.) of
Minnesota, who subsequently voted to re
commit and against the bill, voted against
the subptitute. A motion to recommit it,
which followed, shared a similar fate, be
inc lost. I<M to 172.
There was great excitement throughout
the roll calls, which were followed with
eager interest by thousands of spectators,
who packed the galleries to suffocation.
The Republicans indulged in a demonstra
tion of wild jubilation when the final re
cult was announced.
DE VRIES EXPLAINS HIS
VOTE FOR THE MEASURE
fperjal Disratch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 28.âRepresenta
tive De Vries. who voted for the Porto
Rican bill to-day said:
While the bi'.l in its terms applies to Porto
Rico alone, the course of debate has made
the powers of Congress under the constitution
the rt-a.l isyue. I r^sret that Porto Kico should
liave be*n made th^ subject of the test. On
the one hand, it was asferted In this debate
thst the IVdo.-al statutes wÂ«-re de facto extend
fd tn all j>oF*?!=sionF; on the other, this was
drnied and the power as.^erted to legislate
Â»r*c:fi<-aily for each under the constitution.
>lÂ»le lawyer* contended for each position. The
courts alont- â and. In this case, 'the Supreme
Â«v,urt â can effectively decide the controversy.
The bill is temporary in character, extending
f<^r two years. The tariff duties are far less
than were imposed by ?pain. We have given
tliem ereat relief and at the same time ap
frerted the principle of government in euch
form that Its constitutionality may be deter
mined.
As a Representative from the coast. I deem
!t of paramount importance, before proceeding
to the final d'.Fp'ffUlon of the Philippines, that
the pTwers cf Congress thereover be fully an
nounced by the Supreme Court. Questions of
supreme importance with reference to these
it!andÂ« have beÂ«-n developed by this debate.
Are the laws of ConeTfSf>. by treaty so ex
tended to these Islands, de facto, that Congress
CSOBOt prevent without some protection the
lnuniat'on cf the Pacific Coa?t with the prod
uct* r-f cheap Oriental labor? Are the Chinese
exrluMon laws, by the treaty of peace, de
facto and beyond the powers of Congress to
otherwise legislate, extended to the Phillp-
I-ineii *o that hundreds of thousands of coolies
therein can pass freely within the gates of
Fan Francisco? This bill asserts the prin
ci; le that fucn is r.ot the case, and that Con
irrWÂ« may legislate otherwise.
A* a Representative of California I conceive
my sworn duty to assert this principle of gov
err.mer.t for the protection of the industries
. and lab^r of that State. By passing the bill
to-dÂ«y. we take a. step for an early decision
upon "these pointsâ a decision that will, to my
ralnd. b* a great factor In molding the future
course cf Congress with reference to the Phil
ippines, a decision without which ro intelligible
Â¦ ction can be had by Congress with reference
thereto. Â¦ w â¢" .

THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT.
r~NOLITICAL conditions. are such that about the
Ly only feature of the approaching campaign that at
-.â¢':Â¦ tracts much of popular interest' at this time is that
of the selection of candidates for the Vice Presidency.
It is conceded that McKjnlcy wijl-be reriominated
virtually by acclamation, and that .Bryari, will be again
the Democratic nominee; that the platforms will be
in the main the same as those of 1896, arid the issues
before the people not: widely different. Who shall be
chosen, for Vice President is thus .the . only matter
about which there is any room for speculation or a
contest. .-;.;'Â¦.: :- 'Â¦ Â¦'. 'Â¦'. .."Â¦â¢Â¦.' â¢:'â¢â¢â¢â¢""Â¦â¢ â¢" ''â¢'..
."â¢ As to the choice pf the Bryanites of a running
mate for their leader, it matters little. He had two in
the last campaign and may have a half-dozen this
time if hcj feel like it and thinkit will add to his
chances. The selection of the Republican candidate
is a different thing altogether. That choice should
be made with care, for, while the office is not one of
political power, it has high prestige, and its incum
bent is, in the uncertainty of human life, close to the
Presidency. It is therefore of high : importance that
the nominee for the Vice Presidency should be a
man whom the people would not be unwilling to see
in the Presidency, itself. . ...;.. ... ;:
It was the custom before the war for both parties
to select the candidate for the Vice Presi
dency from the South if . the : Presidential nominee
were from the North, or from the North, if the leader
on the ticket were from the South. Since the war the
custom has been to select one from the East and the
other from the West, for now the two great divisions
of the Union are marked by lines of longitude and
not of latitude. It is right it should be so, but it is
now high time for the division between East and
West, to be rightly drawn. â¢ The Allcghany Moun r
tains are no longer a proper dividing line. President
McKinley is not a* Western but an Eastern man. The
Vice Presidency should in this case, therefore; be
conceded to the section of the country lying west of
the Mississippi River. It is time for the Greater West
to be recognized in political conventions. : 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦. V
A strong sentiment existed in the East in favor of
Roosevelt for .Vice President on the McKinley ticket,
hut since he has emphatically declared he will not ac
cept it there has been no agreement among the East
ern people on any candidate from that section. ; The
field is therefore free and open to all aspirants. Here,
then, is a good opportunity for the Western States to

amount asked for is Â£30,000,000 (about $150,000,000)".
He then went on to say there is nothing sensational
in the Government's naval programme. Nothing in
the estimates has been put ;down. for the purpose of
providing for the mobilization of the fleets of the em
pire, as the Ministry does not: believe the expense
would be. warranted by the situation; The Govern
ment, however, understands that the.' nation expects
the navy to be prepared for emergencies, and .the es
timates . have been made accordingly. If : anything
should occur tÂ« render mobilization necessary Parlia
ment will be promptly asked to vote the -money. â¢
After an address of that kind it was hardly needed
for the orator to declare that the Hague convention
is a thing of the past. When a Government asks for
$150,000,000 for a naval programme in which there
are to be no sensational features it is evident the trend
of affairs among nations is toward anything rather
than disarmament. The peace conference has, in fact,
had less effect upon Europe than the usual morning
prayer has on a debate in the House of Representa-
tives. '. â¢ â¢
Of the total amount asked for the Ministry pro
poses to expend in this and the succeeding year
Â£8460,000 in the construction of new warships. Mr.
Goschen stated that during the same period the Rus
sians would expend Â£4,300,000 for additional war ves
sels, and the French. Â£4,ls4,ooo, so tnat the British
naval increase would be something in excess of that
of Russia and France combined. Thus the estimate
is in accord with the old policy of Great Britain to
maintain a navy equal to that of any alliance likely
to be formed against her.
These statements of the programmes of expendi
tures for the next two years give, however, but an
inadequate idea of the full extent of the naval s plans
now under consideration among the great nations.
The German: Emperor has for a long time been striv
ing to induce the Reichstag to consent to the expen
diture of $10,000,000 a year for the next twenty years
in constructing new ships. Of course each addition
to the number of ships will entail'an addition to the
annual appropriations for maintaining the navy, so
a vote in favor of the policy would mean a much
larger outlay for naval purposes than the. $200,000,000
which is directly asked for.
The French Ministry has asked for $150,000,000 for
a plan of naval expansion to cover a period of seven
years, and about one-third of the amount is to be ex
pended in new ships. The remainder is to be used
in constructing and fortifying ports in various parts
of the globe. A member of the Cabinet is quoted a3
having. said recently: "To have a fleet is nothing.
What is wanted are harbors for the fleet, dotted about
the coasts of the whole world."
It will be seen from these estimates for naval work
in France and Germany that Goschen's estimates for
Great Britain are not sensational. Imperialism costs
money. It is not a cheap fad, nor can it be followed
along lines of economy, or with any regard for tax
payers. In r the meantime it is to be noted that France
and Germany can with difficulty pay the interest on
their, debts and maintain their military establish
ments, and Great , Britain leaves a udozen important
domestic reforms ; untouched for '; lack . of .-money to
defray the expense. ,' Clearly there is nothing in im
perialism to attract and please anything in the
United States except the imagination of a jingo.

AN INVASION OF SHEEP.
IT is announced that the drought in Arizona is
causing the expected shipment of thousands of
sheep thence to California. They are to be located
in Ventura, Los Angeles and Kern counties.
While we have no sympathy with John Randolph's
spiteful declaration that he would walk all the way to
\ ermont, barefoot, to kick a sheep, we are impressed
that some change in the methods of sheep ranging is
reeded, or the Western ranges will soon be perma
nently eaten out and their forage destroyed. The
sheep is a producer of aridity. Sheep are the great
est denuders of the land of aJI foliage known among
our domestic animals. The plains and mountains of
Spain are bare and the rivers of that country are al
ternately torrents and dry beds as a result of free
ranging of sheep. The northeastern shore of the
Adriatic was reduced from the finest forest conditions
to a dry and dusty desert by sheep. When the Aus
trian and other Governments concerned in that re
gion began to reforest it they found it necessary to
use soldiers to keep oil the sheep and goats, in whose
presence reforestation was impossible.
The experience of every country where sheep have
been numerous confirms the conclusion that they are
a paddock animal and should not be free rangers.
This is so well understood in Australia, arid and semi
arid, like Western America, that all the sheepwalks
are leased by the Government! which compels the
leaseholder to paddock them, so that the, flocks are.
changed from one paddock to another before. they
have destroyed the forage. In this way the natural
grasses and other food plants are preserved and mad
permanent. Â¦ . -, "â¢..". â¢â¢ Â¦â¢'.â¢â¢ .
.Using the sheep as a free commoner in our .arid
regions is the worst possible economy. The invasion
of â¢California by Arizona sheep ' means -that the
drought in the Territory has been Â¦ aggravated by
fchfep grazing, and the' results flow in. upon Southern
.â¢California to. multiply.. the disasters. arising in.' the
prolonjred drought :t hat JiaÂ«..pre%-ailed south .'of the
TehacHspi. -r' â¢ * â¢â¢- ' '*"., Â¦/. 'Â¦..â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ ;' Â¦
. .Out of the experience of other countries and : the
rapidly accumulating disaster to pur arid ranges in
this country .issues an impressive lesson. in favor, of
leasing the public domain that is. valuable only .-for
grazing, so- .that the. flockmasters will fence their.
leaseholds,; paddock and protect them,, as; on the
shfcpwalks of Australia.'. The. stockmen of the West
who ar<Â« showing an. : indif7erence.tq this subject which
threatens to let this session of Congress go by. with
out action would better rouse themselves, for delay
now in all probability means that such action will
never be taken, and that the spoliation will go on
until neither sheep â¢ nor cattle have left' any fresh
range on which they may take refuge, and the whole
prazinsr business, will disappear. Â¦'-.'
We. are quite sure that neither the sheep nor cattle
men of California will look amiably upon the inva
f.i'>r! of this woojly. starved and bleating army of de
stroyers from Arizona. Let them see in it not the
passing conditions of an emergency, but what is soon
to be, the permanent status of the whole grazing re
gion,. fed to a Â«tandÂ«till. from which nothing can
rous-'it aeain. and they will appreciate the wisdom
and ntility of the policy which the Secretary of Agii
cuifure is attempting, for the salvation of the ranges,
by leasing them and compelling the herdsmen and
florkmasters to confine their stock to their own lease
hold". ;Â¦Â¦Â¦:.

SAVING THE TREES.
THERE is now no doubt that Congress will act
on the lines suggested by The Call for. 'the
preservation of the Calaveras big trees. The
resolution of Mr. de Vries is unanimously favored by
the House Committee on Public Lands, and the re
port of that' committee suffices to give it an impetus
that will impress both branches of Congress.
Too much credit cannot be ascribed to the ladies of
the California Club for their remarkable intelligence
and energy in planning this campaign and pushing it
to a successful conclusion. The result indicates that
the club is a force that must be reckoned with in the
consideration of large public questions ' related to
economics and civics in this city and State.
The next step, after the big trees are saved, should
be the extension of.the mountain forest reservation so
as to include this- grove. Dropping the existing
reservation down about four townships will accom
plish this, and will not only merge the big trees in a
Federal' reservation but will protect- an-interesting and
valuable .forest tract from spoliation t by fire. This
tract is now covered by yellow and sugar pine forest,
with. much fir, cedar and other .timber. ; ;'.
'.The .private owners of. timber- land need not object
to the- present sequestration .of more forest It in
flicts no harm on them and brings', in' sight a profit
to them to arise from to) carefully, lumbering their
forests as to preserve the oncoming crop of timber
and give permanent value, to their property. Then,
too, when the Federal Government has completed its
policy of reservation, it must enter upon an intelli
gent system of. preservation by scientific forestry. . A
necessary part of such system is the harvesting of all
trees that are ripe, for the saw and the preservation
for the future saw of the growing crop.
Owners of sugar and yellow pine tracts know by
experience that a percentage of the timber is found
to be overripe; it has passed the period at which it
should have been felled, and after the cost of cutting
it is found to be useless for lumber. Nature in this
way indicates as clearly the ripening of trees as she
does that of grain or fruit. Therefore those who
make and those who use lumber should be made to
understand that scientific forestry does riot mean the
prohibition of the use of timber when it is in its best
condition for conversion to, the needs of man, but di
rectly requires such use,- and 'provides for a perma
nent: supply by treating the forests as a constantly
growing crop. /
To destroy all future crops in the ' harvesting of
one is as wasteful and foolish as it would be for an
orchardist in. the Santa .Clara Valley to chop down
all his prune trees for the sake of getting this year's
crop off them conveniently. i ,
These simple principles of .forestry.- should be kept
in mind, and there will.be nowhere any opposition: to
forest reservations, nor to their proper administration
which will secure their permanence. Â¦'

THE MYSTERY OF MODDER RIVER.
IT is natural that joy in England should be rather
hysterical. The surrender of Cronje in Modder
River bed is the first success of British arms in
South Africa that afforded opportunity for reaction
from the gloom that fell with the successive defeats
of White, Gatacre and Buller.
Now that the tragedy is ended it is merged in a
mystery. According to British authority Lord
Roberts, with a force of 45,000 men and one hundred
of the best modern cannon, has received the surren
der, after ten days' pursuit and battle and bombard
ment, of a scant 4000 Boer patriots, and less than a
dozen indifferent cannon! A victory is a victory, t<y
be sure. Lord Roberts appreciated the bumptious
opportunity that it offered for an appeal to the long
brooding spirit of revenge when he added to his dis
patch announcing that with a force of more than ten
British- soldiers to one Boer,. and ten cannon to one
third rate Boer gun, he had avenged -Majuba Hill.
The Boer reputation for steadfast fighting and brave
defense will not suffer by such boasting. The mili
tary world is asking how long will it take to com
plete the assassination Chamberlain has planned, if it
take ten British soldiers, ten days, with one hundred
fine cannons, to capture one Boer soldier with ten
poor guns?- Â¦ Â¦ V*- ; ". : 'â¢ â¢V.':
While the fight was on and Cronje stood at bay,
grimly defending the weakest position on the whole
line;between Kimberley and iÃloemfontein, an enor
mous overestimate of his force and the casualties it was
suffering was made public by the British commander.
Now that concealment is no longer possible the
startling fact appears that Cronje had only one man
to ten and one gun to ten, that his losses were insig
nificant, that he held his ground until some military
purpose, that is yet a myitery, was served, and then
surrendered his little force and supplied the British
commander an opportunity to send a flamboyant dis
patch and Cecil Rhodes to disclose the sordid motive
for the assassination of the two republics.
And still the military world is asking if one Boer
hold out ten days against ten British soldiers, in the
least defensible position, how Jong will it take to
complete the conquest?
There is hardly a parallel in the history of cam
paigns to the address and endurance, the courage and
spirit, of Cronje and his men. His retreat from Kim
berley was begun with ox teams. The pursuit was
with cavalry and mounted. infantry and the best horse
trains. Yet his rearguard held back 45,000 men until
he had covered more than half the distance to Bloem
fontein, and when he was brought to bay at last the
pursuit was checked until he built such defenses that
the fire of a hundred cannon, incessantly maintained
day and night, caused but little damage. Its sole
military utility to the British was that it prevented a
further uncovered movement forward. While he
sheltered his force from British shells Lord Roberts*
force kept well away from range of the rifles in the
hands of the Boer sharpshooters, and made no ap
proach to the Modder bed except in the burrows
bored by the sappers and miners. Had Roberts
ordered an open field assault there would have been
left alive more than one Boer to ten British^
It was a gallant defense. The Boer General was
cut off from communication, from all source of sup
plies; his food and ammunition were of necessity in
short supply. His stand was made in the river bed,
with a wild country around on either bank. There
is no evidence that he expected succor or reinforce
ments, or that his rescue by such means was any part
of the Boer plan of campaign. Examined externally,
and in lack of any knowledge from the inside, the
military, value of his brave adventure seems to have
been the luring to the pursuit of his ox-drawn train
of Roberts' 45,000 men and 100 guns, in order 'to
leave Buller to. cross and recross the Tugela, advance
and retreat, without help from his chief. In other
words, it resembled the brave sacrifice of the" few
Boer soldiers in one of the earliest actions of this
war, who stood in the open and faced; the fire of
twenty times their number that the main body of their"
comrades might have time to change and-better their
position. Â° -!'."-Â¦"" Â°
History walks behind all human actions, in the path
of all armies and in the smoke and blood of o all bat
tles, making impartial record of what men do. She
will not disarrange her page with the frantic exulta
tion that rages in London. But she will illuminate it
with the story of the brave old commander, under the
flag of a republic, who withstood manfully more than
ten times his force in men and guns while his country
men and their allies- gained time to perfect plans for
the- more perfect defense of their, freedom and their
firesides." Â¦â¢/Â¦ . ' â¢ -â¢".- : - * -

MAGGIE MOORE'S
IRISH COMEDY
WHEN in the course of theatrical
events there comes a ray of sun
shine in the form of a good,
wholesome, honest, modest com
edy we may be thankful for the small
fgLvor * * "~ r J ' ' * '"
Of such are the first two acts of Maggie
Moore's Irish farce. "Mrs. Quinn s
Twins " It is not dazzling, but there is
something very refreshing In the atmo
sphere of those Irish yesterdays that
Boucicault used to serve us in his com-r
edies and of which we now get so little.
This being true. Maggie Moore's reap
pearance last night was not a disappoint
ment, except to her. perhaps, for . the
house was not what it should have been.
It was a mistake to open with "The fai
lence of Dean Maltland ", in which she did
not appear and in which the company, in
cluding Mr. Roberts, was variously defi
cient But to err is managerial, and I can
do no more than say that a very poor
show has been succeeded by a very good
Â°The third act .of "Mrs: Quinn's Twins"
is weak or worse, and would be bettered
by the omission of -a lot of mediocre spe
cialties. And If Miss Moore, did not sing
one's enjoyment, would not suffer. Her
acting is capital, and her characterizatiori
is sound and. sincere; -It is. never broad
and always humorous:" I do not know or
a woman on the stage who can do an Irish
character in the Â¦ same straightforward*
natural way without exaggeration or vul
garity. â¢ -.--.-'â¢
â¢ A failure is a serious handicap and Mr.
Roberts has that to contend with. He was
negligible as the cleric in "The Silence of
Dean Maltlaod," but as an Irish lad .with
honesty in his heart and wit on his tongue
he is something of a revelation. In the
part of a schoolmaster he is humorous
and intelligent 'and his â¢ acting is well
poised, reserved and effective. His dance
with Maggie Moore is one of the pleas
ant episodes of the play and goes a great
way to make one forget his meretricious^
Maltland. -. .â¢-'Â¦â¢ ; ,' . ' , Â° ; .
' The company redeems itself In the male
department, Mr. Ward doing particularly
good work as Qulnn, the -fiddler, and Mr.;
Cochrane, separated j from his " impossible;
Sydney-made clothes, is in good charac
ter as Sou ire O'Donnell. â¢ â¢ , Â¦
"Mrs. Quinn's Twins" Is not a preten
tious comedy, but It has a quality that
reaches out over the footlights and keeps
one pleasantly Interested. I found it quite
enjoyable, children and nil. :Â¦ , â¢ .

LOS ANGELES. Feb. 28.â An . Important
decision, affecting â¢ street, opening and

umns to the page. There are: twenty-one
lines In each column. The : consonantal
features are identical with 'those- Just con
sidered. The peculiar forms of certain
consonants are repeated here. Thero . is
less scribal annotation, and with the one
column less the page looka freer and:
cleaner.-. This codex is .' also :;-from the
Sephardic school.. Only one familiar. with
the Hebrew text would discover any nc
tlceable difference. Such, a difference
there is, however^ for. In this, codex, the
supralinear. vowel punctuation is ,em
ployed.: .There : were rival; systems of
punctuation among thescribes. one school
writing the vowel points below, the other
above the consonantal. text. The suprau
near Is the Babylonian style. It is the
more complex, and although it maintained
itself untilthe seventeenth century it was
destined to give- way to -the. Â¦ ln
fralinear-system,'which the printed Bible
employs. This codex contains the later
prophets, i. c.. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel
and the twelve minor prophets. It .s tor
the critical study of the prophets what
the earlier codex is for the study of the
and all. simply reproduction* of the orig
inal Massoretlc text. Some MSS'.- have the
supralinear. others the lnfralinear system
of . vowel punctuation. : Some ' MSS. have
the.Chaldee In alternate lines wlth'tha
Hebrew text. There are peculiarities. In
the shape of one or more- of .the conso
nants that have their significance to tho
scholar. : The marginal notes present- a
great variety of minor differences, but
these variations afford but little help In
the. correction of errors and. throw but
little: light - upon the obscurities of â¢ tho
text. -, In the Massoretlc text- we have an
exact :: reproduction of the Hebrew scrip
tures as they were In the .seventh -and
efghth centuries A. D. To get \ back of
this* text it is necessary' to make use of
the: different versions, and especially the
different' editions of the Greek" version.
This Greek translation ; was . completed
about 150 B. C. and repeatedly gives evi
dence that it has underlying It a different
text.. -.'Â¦Â¦ â¢ Â¦â¢' . . â¢
The great majority of Hebrew MSS* be
long to a period between the. twelfth and
the sixteenth centuries. They are for the
most part fragments. That they should
be so late, so few and so fragmentary
finds, ready explanation. The revival of
learning in Italy, that secured and pre
served for us the classic text, was a re
vival outside of. the church, and.' at heart
antagonistic, to- It. By Its discovery , and
.Acquisition 'of the- originals of, the Greek
and Â¦Â¦ Roman classics it reveals what
might- have . been, done for the Jewish
literature as well. .. =â¢" I
Â¦ Then. too. the blind hatred and persecu
tion of the Jews by the Gentiles, tended
directly to the destruction of the Hebrew
MSS..; the Jews were compelled to conceal
them In order to keep them, and they pre
ferred to burn them rather than see them
In the hands of their deadly foes. Â¦

V. HEBREW MANUSCRIPTS.
BT CHARLES HORSWELL., PH. D.
The oldest known manuscript of the He
brew. Bible is In the. British Museum.. : It
has no date upon It, but the original por
tion of it is supposed to have been writ-,
ten about S2O-SSO A." D. Il ls written on
vellum. The page measures sixteen and
a half Inches in length and thirteen and
.an eighth inches in breadth. As the MS.
now:is, lt : consists pt 186 pages, of three
columns each, and twenty-one lines in the
column. \!-pf the IS6 pages, 129 exhibit the.
original portion. The remaining fifty
seven leaves are a later addition,' written
on paper and dated 1540 A. D. The entire
MS. contains the first five books of the Old
Testament. . The original portion begins
with. Genesis xxxlx, 20, and runs on con
tinuously, with the exception' of --two
pages, to Deuteronomy 1,-. 33.' '-The hand
writing ls the. Sephardic, the Spanish-
Portuguese Bchool. It is written -in a
large, clear letter and presents a beautiful
page. The consonantal, line Is .'about one
half inch in breadth and the space be-
Pentateuch: A glance at a third MS. will
show what artistic skill the copyist gome
times displayed in the lettering, and par
ticularly in the arrangement of the mar
ginal notes. -This MS. bears the date 1300
A.. D.:. -The marginal notes are artistically
arranged in the form of conventional hs
urea. of dragons and reptiles. .The first
.word of each book Is written n consptc
uouslylarge letters.
These three M 33. illustrate fairly well
the form and character which the varying
.codices present. -They- are all reproduc
tions of a single text. They have all pro
ceeded from one and "the same original
type; ' In the seventh and eighth centuries
A.. r>. Jewish scholars, by a complete sys
tem of vowel points and accents, perfected
what they believed to be a definite and
accurate edition of the text. Their addi
tions to the consonantal text are called
the Massorah, or tradition. The scribes
themselves who made the text are called
the Massorltes and their text Is known
as the Massoretlc text. AH extant Hebrew
MSS. are copies of this text. These re
productions have been collected from dif
ferent countries and are In the handwrit
ing of different schools of copyists â Ara
bian, Sephardic. Italian. Franco-Italian
and German; and they present, naturally,
many minor differences. But they are. on*

MURDERED FOB

The. body I; if.'. "Billy";
Simpson, ..an . Indian;, who v has: .â¢ .for
many '; beeri', ; 'a- ' resident ': of- - a
rancheria oni. : .Rancho Chico, was' found
at about ' 6:SO o'clock this mprriingr. That
murder had â¢;..::. been y. done- ;â¢ was \ Â¦;Â¦; evlf
derit â¢ 'at a 'glance/- and "V that the
motive- which: prompted., cold-blooded
murder- "of .an.-. inoffensive -Indian -.was
robbery â¢ was -recognizable Â¦'Immediate
ly after the- body and clothing were ex
amined: Some brutal thug or thugs had
for a few dollars Simpson might have in
his pockets literally beat the Indian _to
death,-; carried, the, body' into: the- dense
shadows of. the trees near General Bld
well's mansion^: and- rifled '; the .pockets.
How: much the: murderers secured; will
probably. I . never Vbe known; but It is sure
they only, left a couple of keys and a dime,
the latter -being.. caught In a . fold of the
trousers : pocket ; which .had. been; turned

â¢:Â¦-.> As to who committed the murder there:
â¢Is Very little, for the officers to work upon,
although there .will be a search made for
r a : strangrer who, appeared. at. the rear door
of the Bidwell mansion at 8:30 o'clock and
asked to see General Bidwell.: The strang
er appeared to be somewhat Under the In
fluence^ of liquor, and ho was told that
General Bidwell was busy Â¦ but .-to .call
again and he could. see .the general.' I The
man went away biitdid not. return. About
a half or three-quarters of an hour later
One of the women employed there heard
the: dog growl fiercely and Jump from -.the
porch. . The woman was- quite 5 nervous
after the visit of.thfe: drunken man and
called, the '--dog: .back to the porchu : -: This
morning the. tracks of the' dog show 'that
he had started Btralght for the spot where
Simpson's body was found and- it. is: con
fidently believed that he wis aroused by
the scuffling of the two men.-: Â¦Â¦::-'. -J Â¦â¢.Â¦Â¦-. â¢.'
There are. numerous theories regarding
the murder. .Some -are of.- the Â¦ opinon
that the murderer was lying in wait for
some other -person -and when Simpson
came along attacked him believing him- to
be the Intended victim. It seems to be
generally known,' however; that Simpson
always had from $10 to $20 in his pockets
and some thugs knowing this may have
waited for him. Sheriff -Wilson, : with
Deputy Sheriff Goe and Constable Potter
are ;making a thorough search, of the
grounds in the hope Of finding the weapon
used to -.commit- the murder and In- the
meantime effort wlll.be made to locate the
man who called at the Bidwell mansion
about 8:30 o'clock;. ;.. .'Â¦ . . â¢: .. '-..

THE STOCK MARKET.

Shipping Intelligence
Nczv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2S.â Evidence accumulated
as ihe day progressed In the stock market that i
the phort interest in the group of Fpecialties!
which has recently been declining had become j
unwieldy and betore the day had closed an
urgent demand developed for these stocks from
the bears who had over-stayed the market and
who were eager bidders for stock to cover
short contracts. Thus the apparent anomaly
was presented of a buoyant rise In stocks con
cerning wtilch recent unfavorable news was
Â¦till uncontradicted or new facts developed of
a etill more unfavorable character. Additional
mechanics' liens were piled up on the assets
of the Third Avenue and a receiver was ap
pointed, yet the rtock .offered firm resistance
ml yesterday's low level and roee at one time
as much as 84- - The franchise tax commis
sion which recent rumors by professionals have
credited with a purpose to. practically confis
cate the net earnings of local corporations
began its Fitting to-day and the stocks of the
New York public utilities rose from 24 to 6
points. Published -reports alleged continued
demoralization and cutting of prices of Sugar
and the conviction of professional speculators
remains unshaken that the next dividend will
be cut; but Sugar shows a net gain of 214.
The pimple explanation' is that bear traders
have been selling these stocks without hold-
Ing certificates with which to make deliveries
and when they tried to buy they found a
horde of traders t ln the Fame situation and a
lively competition rprang up to secure the
floating supply. People's Uas. the Tobacco
nocks, a number of the metal stocks. Western
T'nlon and come others which have been under
rt-cent pressure moved upward under the same
Influence. The Leather stocks weakened on the
yearly earnings reported, which were much be
low recent sanguine estimates and the bears
endeavored to create a diversion In thÂ»lr favor
by raiding stocks. The rest of the market re
fused to respond. Relieved of the elements of
acute weakness which have recently dragged
It back the railroad list rose strongly and quite
uniformly, the exceptions being stocks which
have already advanced in face of the recent
weakness. The advance was rather marked In
a rroup of low-priced common stocks of com
panies whose preferred stocks have already re
flected their improved prospects of dividends
by reason of Increasing earnings. Foremost
of the group were Atehison and Southern.Rail
way, which rose JTifil respectively. There
were rood rises also In St. Louis Southwestern,
W abash preferred. Chicago Great Wetern,
Colorado and Southern second preferred and
North American. The movement of grangers,
led by Burlington, m-as based on the fall of
â¢now In the 'Northwest, which is believed to
afford security to the wheat In the ground, as
reflected by the downward tendency ef that
cereal on the grain exchange. This movement
Is of rpectai Interest as being the first of any
tnoroept Jn the etock market founded on the
prospects of this year's crop, thus ushering In
Â¦ new Influence and hazard which will play a
prowing part In the problem of values. The
closing was active and strong at about the
bÂ»st. \
The bond market was not very active, but
was firm. Total sale*, par value. $1,095,000. c
United States 6s (coupon) advanced 4 and 6s

Trade in Nezv York.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
'â¢The, railroad situation continues eminently
Â«at if factory, -for' earnings are showing steady
pains over the Increases of last year, and every
Indication points- to the maintenance of this
Improvement for a long time to come. Gen
eral trade is in excellent condition and this
week is witnessing the largest rush of buyers
tc New York that was ever known. The
wholesale stores and hotels are filled with rep
resentatives of ' big Interior business houses,
who -are here enthusiastic o\-er the outlook in
the West and South, a-nd ready buyers at ad
vancing : prices for â¢ merchandise. : In the dry
#?Â»ods market there .is oftener .a scarcity of
rr>ods than of buyers." This means a large
West-bound traffic for: the railroads during the
next few weeks. Last week's East-bound
traffic was the blg-gest on record. ' During the
la>t five weeks the East-bound tonnage ajr-
Rrepated 795.000 tons, against 624.000 tons same
time Jn IW>9 and 431.V-0 tons in .1898. A better
luill ar(rum"nt for railroad stocks could not
be conceived. We Ftitl believe that many of
the medium and "low priced railroad issues
<nir.hii>e the, greatest profit and safety of any
in the '.Ist. There are now no class of proper
ties better crpanize.l. better managed, in bet
ter financial condition, in better physical con
dHion. and -with sreater stability of earning
l"iuer than the railroads of the. United States.
The hiirh-prlced issues are now so completely
absorbed by institutions and rich men or held
at euch figures that they offer no- attractions
to the ordinary investor and speculator; but
there remain a number of Issues which have
juct entered nr nre about to enter the dividends
raying pile and thpse will undoubtedly be the
speculative favorites." ; . â¢

NEW YORK. Febi 28.â The wildest excite-"
ment witnessed on the Cotton Exchange in
recent years prevailed Â¦ to-day, . transactions
reaching the enormous total of about pne
million, bales.' The shorts were' nothing' less
than. furious to cover. At tlmes-so great was
the excitement brokers, would -.be buying at
2 or 3 points above what- others were offering
to sell: While the demand was general, and
largely from European Bources the feature of
the local Â¦ market was the. Insatiable demand
from a Wall - street concern reputed to be
heavily short of March' contracts and also re
puted to have been -a heavy . seller yesterday
In keeping with a large number of bearish
dispatches--. which they -sent forth yesterday.
This concern bought enormous quantities of
cotton, especially for August delivery. At the
best point the. market showed the unusual ad
vance of-18<Â§39 points. The record of transac
tions overflowed the large board .provided for
their, accommodation and an auxiliary board
was provided to complete the record of the
day*-s transaction*. Just before the close there
was a selling movement to secure profits and
the market finished Irregular and easy at a
net advance of HSU points. â¢ ; ' \ -.-.

CHICAGO, . Feb. 28.â Up to fifteen ''--minutes
of. the close of.. the session the. wheat market
was dull arid with a fractional decline from
yesterday's close. Business was almost en
tirely In the. hands of scalpers. The heavy
snowfall over the wheat' belt was "the bearish
influence, but the market bore up ftgalnst It
with great fortitude until the patience of hold
ers was exhausted and they utilized the last
quarter of an hour in ridding- themselves -of a
burden which nobody seemed to want. May
opened at 65%Sj6tic, and touched 66V4c
early, but. the major portion of the rest of the
session fluctuations were between 65%J?66c
The slump which wound up the day varied
May from i 65% c. to 654 c. and the close was
weak, %@lc under yesterday, at 65%@65>*ia
Â¦The delays and embarrassments of the -storm
had a dulling effect on the corn market and
the pit was j very quiet. Â¦ â¢
:.The -.break in wheat cost the coarse cereal
only a- shade at the end. May closed a shade
reduced from yesterday at 34%(g v 3sc.
Oats were inactive, remaining at one price,
23%e for May, throughout the session. The
clone yesterday was 23%@23>4c..
- Provisions were weak. . There was scattered
liquidation throughout the day and little out-
Bide demand. On the decline there was con
siderable stop-loss selling by commission
houses, which helped along the weakness.
There was come demand for lard early against
foreign acceptances, but this was soon satis
fled. May pork closed lie under yesterday.
May lard 24R5e down and May ribs 6c de
pressed at $5 75Â®6 774.

Mr. Mel\in had been using an eye lo

dentally-he picked up a small vial'of.car

dropped a small quantity of the burning
fluid into his eye, only, then discovering
by the intense pain the ' mistake Â¦he . had
made. Rushing to the wash basin; he tried
to cleanse the. poison, from -his: Â«ye,. and
while applying a soothing lotion an ocu
list was summoned.. who by prompt treat

been keeping the eye lotion. Without pay
ing attention this morning I reached for
a vial and the glass dropper. I did not
know how serious a mistake had been
made until I felt the burning In my eye.
I nearly fainted from the eudden Inten
sity of the pain, but kept my senses to
gether, realizing what was the trouble. !
"Being enough of a druggist to know

McCurdy is Â£3. years old. and until a few
Â¦â¢ -"Jtr ego held nightly vigils !n the capa
< .:Â¦â¢ of wwermnn at the Southern -Pacific
Company's railroad crossing at Seventh
and Webster streets, this city. It was
there In the tower during the long winter
nights while operating the signals for the
local trains with the use only of his left
hand that the fancied horror seized him.
He had been previously employed about
the engines In the West Oakland railroad
yards. -. Ono day about a year ago, while
occupied in wiping between / the driving
rod and wheel, of a mogul locomotive that
was ready to start out on a run, the big
ma-chine suddenly moved about a foot,
and before McCurdy could . escape his
right arm was crushed so badly that the
surgeons at the Receiving Hospital found
it absolutely necessary to amputate the
injured member at the elbow. .' .- .
/ When McCurdy recovered the railroad
company assigned him to have charge of
the Webster: fcjid Seventh, streets' -tower.-:'
house.:- But "soon McCurdy began com
plalninr that the/ dismembered and In
terred hand: still pained him. This weird
idea so preyed upon him that he con
cluded: nothinu les6 than a further ampu
tation would relieve him...;.. /..' Â¦ Â¦Â¦'. ' Â¦Â¦-.-Â¦Â¦."
\McCurdy was admitted to the Southern
Poclflc Company's hospital in San Fran
cisco; and there : several weeks ago; he
submitted to an operation for the removal
of about two Inches of the stump arm.
Still the .awful hallucination : of the
cramped hand in the grave remained en
graved on his mind.-. -Yet determined to
shake his own belief and ultimately ap
pease- forever his imagination, the unfor
tunate:, young towerman & few days ago
araln submitted to an ' operation. Â¦ This
time Drs. Gardner, Lane and Miller am
putated the stump arm at the shoulder
socket. . Marvelous as It appears to relate,
McCurdy declares to-day that the pain
from the cramped and?..buried hand, his
Imaginary,. Nemesis,- has disappeared. In
a. few days ; McCurdy : will be able to re
turn to hlg home; 1319 Ninth street, Ala

geons consider It-one of the most peculiar
cases that has come to their attention.
My son us"cd to: say that his amputated
hand was cramped In the (rrave, and that
the flnpers pained him continually. We all
tried; to disabuse /his -mind of . the Idea,
but he would say. that the pain of his
buried hand would drive him crazy. We
hoped that after the. two : Inches were
amputated from the crippled arm :Carle
ton would be relieved, and were surprised
when he informed the doctors that he
was still troubled with the cramped fin
gers. Even the physicians at the Oak
land Recelvlnf. Hospital tried"- to: con
vince xny son that when; his -amputated
hand was burled It was laid flat on a piece
of board co that the fingers could hot pos
sibly draw up or: clench; but It ..was all. in

tire confidence of their- employers," so
much so that they were not required to
furnish bonds, and their employers were
loth to believe that the young men; had
absconded until confronted with indisput

How the Theft Was Managed.
Jt has. been the custom of the Empo

Bryan. On receipt of the statements the
cashier would on the. day -before the last
of the month hand the amount of salaries
In a lump sum to the paymaster, who,
with the assistance of Bernard, the cash
sales accountant, would segregate the
salaries of all the employes, place- them
in envelopes and lock them in the vault
in the cash boxes of the different de
partment*, ready for distribution on the
fallowing day.

after a quick oxamination of the missing
