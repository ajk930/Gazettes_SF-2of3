BLOEMFONTEIN. March 13.â Lord
Roberts entered the Free State capital to
day (Tuesday) practically unopposed. He
lay at Venters Vlei, fourteen miles away,
last night, with General 'Kelly-Ker.ny'a
and General Colville's divisions, the
Guards brigade and the mounted infantry.
Gf ::eral French, having cut the railway
and tÂ« lepraphs. experienced a slight skir
mish with some Boers holding the cepjes
couthoast of the town. Early In the morn
ing the cavalry brigade moved forward
and occupied several kopjes which ion
mandr-rj the Boers.
A few well placed shells from the rlorse
Artillery drove off the enemy. Genera!
French thr-n sent out scouts to feel their
way toward the town, perceiving which
the corrcsjondents of the Sydney Herald
and the London Daily News, with one
ether, galloped forward and entered Â«.he
town, which wore an everyday aspect.
The people wore out shopping or for morn
ing walks, and at first the three news
paper men w^re regarded as townsfolk.
Later, when it became known that they
were the forerunners of the British army,
they were greeted cordially and conduftci
to a club, where they met Mr. Fraswr of
the Executive Council, the Mayor and
ether officials. These they persuadc-d to
take carriages and go to meet Lord Rob
erts.
As the party drove out of the city the
British cavalry were closing around like
a high net. The deputation soon arrived
opposite the kopje where Lord Roberts
mired, and â¢ sometimes abandoned. Dot
after so- many hard and sometimes cruel
experiences she can no longer admit that
her duty to the world should stand. beforo
her obligations to herself.

British Generals Under
Lord Roberts Uniting
in a Movement That
Places the Republican
Forces in a Difficult
Position.
Joubert Is Now Concentrating His Forces
Thirty-Five Miles North of Bloemfon
tein, Where He May Make an Effort to
Check the Advance of the Imperial In
vaders.
? â â
LONDON, March 16. â Lord Roberts has already started
his movement to crush between the forces of Generals
Clements, Gatacre and Brabant and his own army the
Boers who have held the line of the Orange River for many
months. General Gatacre has crossed the Orange River at
Bethulie and simultaneously General Pole-Carew, with the
Guards Brigade, two guns and mounted infantry, has been sent
south from the Free State capital by railway. He was at Beth
any, twenty miles below Bloemfontein, yesterday. The object
of this move is to secure for Lord Roberts' army control of the
railway between Bloemfontein and Cape Colony, which will im
mensely shorten the British lines of communication.
The Boers are in a difficult position. If they fight General
Clements is ready to advance from Xorvals Pont, General Bra
bant from Aliwal North and General Gatacre from Bethulie,
while General Pole-Carew will be threatening their rear. .
Lord Roberts is evidently under the impression that his
force is ample to meet any resistance which he is likely to en
counter in the Free State, as General Warren's division has been
ordered back from Durban to rejoin General Buller.
The Boers have been locatted in several strong positions
close to the junction of Drakensberg and Biggersberg Range,
from which it would be impossible for General Buller. acting
alone, to drive them without heavy loss of life and a repetition
of the terrible encounters among the hills of the Tugela. But
with Lord Roberts moving north along, the. .railway General
Joubert will be obliged to divide his forces. Should he suffer
defeat at the hands of the commander in chief General Buller
would then seize the opportunity to advance.
General Joubert is now concentrating his forces at Brand
fort, thirty-five miles north of Bloemfontein, where he may
make an effort to check the British.
All the dispatches to the London newspapers describe at
great length the enthusiastic welcome given to the British
troops by the inhabitants of Bloemfontein. It should be borne
in mind, however, that a large percentage of the residents of
the Free State capital are English, most of whom remained
there after war was declared.
CORRESPONDENTS FIRST IN BLOEMFONTEIN
was stationed, and this correspondent rode
forward and had the honor of announcing
to the commander In chief that Bloem
fontein would surrender.
A little later the deputation began to
approach and Lord Roberts went forward
to meet them.
The scene was picturesque In the ex
treme. A few yards away the guns of a
battery pointed their grim mouths toward
the late position of the Boers, while the
tin roofs of Bloemfontein shone In the dis
tance.
After salutes had been exchanged a
member of the deputation stepped forward
and declared that the town wished to sur
render, hoping that Lord Roberts "voulJ
protect life and property. He replied that,
providing there was no' opposition, he
would undertake to guarantee the security
of both. The interview was very cordial,
without a sign of solemnness. It 3truck
this correspondent that the deputation
seemed relieved by the presence of thi
British troops. Lord Roberts notiflei the
deputation of his Intention of entering the
town In state, and they withdrew to in
form the townspeople.
Lord Roberts then made his military
depositions, ordering the First Brigade to
follow him and to take possession of the
town. With his staff and the military at
taches he descended the kopje and arrived
on the plain, v.-here he waited until the
cavalry approached. Then he entered thÂ«
city, followed by his personal staff.- the
general staff, the military attaches and
the troops. Â§SmllseÃ*
BRITONS SATISFIED WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
LONDON". March 16, 5 a. m.â Events are moving In the South African cam
paign In a epwdy and satisfactory manner from both the military and political
points of view. It could hardly have been expected by the most sanguine Eng
lishmen that they would take a turn so favorable.
It appears that when Major Weston cut the railway north of Bloemfontein
he thereby Intercepted General Joubert, who. far from having retired from the
campaign, was then coming southward with 3000 men. presumably to superintend
the defense. Elaborate defense works three miles long had been prepared out
side the town.
No Boer wounded were left In Bloemfontein. When asked this reason by Lord
Roberts'. Mr. Frazer replied: "The burghers do not like fish and would not care
to co to Cape Town." V '.â¢." : ...- *
The evidence goes to Fhow that, so far as the southern part of the Free State
is concerned, there will be no further resistance. It is understood that Mr.
Frazer. Mr. Wessels and other leaders are quite prepared to accept the position
of a pelf-governing British colony. ";".â¢Â¦
The cheers which greeted the reading in Parliament yesterday of the corre
spondence with the United States are re-echoed throughout the country. The
ppeech of M. Delcasse has Increased this satisfaction and, taken with the general
belief that Emperor Nicholas Is personally averse to any intervention, these inci
dents spread the Jdea that there will be no further serious attempt to interfere
from any quart' r.
Mr. Montagu White's threat. In an American newspaper, that the Boera will
cacrifice Johannesburg and raze It to the ground if necessary, is not taken very
seriously. Mr. Chamberlain's statement that President Kruger has already
been warned as to the consequence of such conduct. Is regarded as showing that
sufficient precaution has been taken. The Times suggests that the burghers
should be warned that their farms will be taxed as a guarantee against any dam
age to British property, but no serious apprehensions are entertained of such con
duct as 3ux. White is said to have foreshadowed. J. B. Robinson, the milllion
alre mlne'owner, says he does not believe the Boers would be so foolish.
By the time Lord Roberts reaches the Vaal River he will command some 80 -
000 men. while General Buller will have 40,000. From the military po!-t of view
the critics now think there Is nothing to fear.
CAMPAIGN AGAINST BOERS ON THE
LINE OF ORANGE RIVER IS BEGUN
VOLUME LXXXVII â NO. 106.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SAX FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1900.
f? ONDON, March 16. â Spencer Wilkinson, in the Morning
Post, commenting upon the very satisfactory nature. of the
==^ occupancy of Bloemfontein, says: "The anticipation that the
Boer resistance along the Orange River would collapse on British
occupation of the Free State capital seems to have been realized.
It will be interesting to await the meeting and perhaps the fight
between the British troops moving southward on the railway/and
the retiring Boers.
"Looking to the strength of Lord Roberts' army by the time
he reaches Vaal River, it is not surprising that Sir Charles War
ren's division is retained in Natal. An advance of the two armies
on separata lines will be quite the best form of operations to crush
the enemy's forces and to bring about his absolute submission.
"The Boers cannot longer afford to divide their forces. Serious
resistance in Natal would enable Lord Roberts to. cross the Vaal
and compromise the Boer force in Natal. Serious resistance at
Brandfort or Ventersberg would enable General Buller to pass the
mountains and threaten the Boer communications."

asked whether the Government of

with the view to bringing about peace In
South Africa, the Government leader, Mr.

would not accept the intervention of. any

Mr. Balfour's reply was as follows:
The United States Charge d' Affaires, March

ing telegram from Mr. Hay:
"By way of friendly and good office Inform
the British Minister cf Foreign Affairs that I
to-day received a telegram from the United

Government of the South African Republic re
quests the President of the United States to In

and saying that a similar request has been
made to the representatives of the European
powers. In communicating this request I am
directed by the President of the United States
to express the earnest hope that a way will be
found to bring about peace and to say that he
would be glad in any friendly manner to aid In
bringing . about the desired result."
"lhe reading of this dispatch was greeted
with cheers from the Irish members.' v
Continuing, Mr. Balfour said:
"Lord Salisbury requested Mr. White
to convey the sincere acknowledgment, of
her Majority's Government to' the Govern
ment of the United States for the friendly
tone of their communication and to say
that her Majesty's Government does not
propose to accept the intervention of any
power in settlement of South , African
affairs."
Loud and prolonged cheering followed
this statement.
Boer Sympathizers Responsible.
Mr. " Balfour. replying to Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, the " opposition
leader, who asked whether, in view of the
numerous recent disturbances connected
with peaceable meetings called to discuss
South African affairs, or directed against
the persons and property of Individuals,
because of their war opinions. : the Gov
ernment' would cause an inquiry as to
how far . and . by whom the 'â¢Â¦ disturbances

that the Government felt the responsibil-

incs In the heated state of public feeling.

Mr. Balfour's answer discouraged the
right of public meeting.
Mr. Balfour, replying, reiterated . that
pro-Boers were- not "justified' in forcing
tholr ideas, though possibly all right, buy
which were not' agreeable to the majority
of the nation. .; He denied, that he had said
anything Inconsistent with the 'principles

FRAZER DENOUNCED
STEYN AS A COWARD
LONDON. March 16.â The Standard has
the following dispatch from Bloemfontein.
dated ' Thursday, March 15: ,
"The civil authorities here definitely
jnade up their minds to surrender on Mon

It had covered forty miles In twenty

Truth had. been taken away a thorough
search of the premises was Instituted.
The place was elaborately, fitted up. The

advertised. In all there were twenty-thre'Â«
girls employed in the place to look after
with extensive correspondence.

sued at the solicitation of the District At
torney's office. It charges that by, means
of his ' representations he I secured g many
paying members of the association to
whom he gave what he called his "absent
treatment." The blanks for these "absent
treatments," called for a first payment of
to for one month's treatment. -
Truth has been â¢ conducting the estab
lishment for about six months and has
had all the business he could attend to.
He took his arrest very calmly and made
no statement. , Mrs. Truth was not mo
lested. She refused to say anything re
garding her husband's arrest.
It is said that his business has brought
him in $30,000 a week regularly.

CAPE TOWN, March 15.â Lord Methuen,
speaking at the Town Hall, Klmberley,
to-day, said:
"Although some of the enemy's men
were guilty of dastardly tricks, we must
remember that their army is not organ

I never wish to meet a braver general
than Cronje and ! never served in a war
where there was less vindictive feeling be

acquainted with the fact of the proposed

designated as a member, and that Rear
Admiral A. S. Barker, commandant of the
navy yard at Norfolk, who served with
credit on the "War Board organized just
before the war with Spain, will also be
attached to the board. Captain R. D.
Evans, Captain H. C. Taylor and Captain
F. E. Chadwick are also spoken of in
connection with membership en the board.
Several officers are of the opinion that
Rear Admirals Hlchborn and Melville
should be selected on account of their
knowledge of construction and engineer
ing. The order, however, recites that the
board is formed primarily for the purpose
of perfecting war measures. Conse
quently construction will not at first cer
tainly be among the board's duties. The
board is axpected to devise plans of strat
egy to be followed, the distribution of
ships and the strength of vessels on for
eign stations and to take all needful
measures for the defense of the United
States in time of war. There is no ex
pectation of course that war will shortly
occur, but it is proposed by the depart

and. to prepare the service for operations
In case of war. Secretary Long has decided
toorganize what will probably be known
as a policy board, of which Admiral
Dewey will be the president. This state
ment can be made upon high authority.
A formal order announcing the creation
ol the board and giving instructions as to
its membership and duties will be Issued
in the coursa of a- few days. It has been
signed by the Secretary after consultation
with the President, and nothing remains
to make it effective except its promulga
tion and the Issuance of the crders desig
nating the officers elected as members to
report for duty when the sessions occur.
" The' order does not state who shall be
the, members of the board, but it speci
fies that officers holding four positions in
the service shall always be attached to
the board. Incumbents holding those po
sitions will consequently be required to
serve. The admiral of the navy, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, chief of thÂ«Â»
office of naval intelligence and the presi
dent of the Naval War College are among
these. There are five other members of
the board whose rank is designated, and
officers holding such rank will be ordered
to report for duty as members of the
board. The officers holding the positions
named above are:
Admiral George Dewey, Rear Admiral
A. S. Crowninshield, Captain Charles D.

EVERT pecular day of the year open

of bandages from eick rooms and hos

tion. pa.Â«s freely througrh the city's most
densely thronged streets when business
compels thousands to be imperiled. The
(senses revolt at the smell of decaying
vegetation and the winds sweep millions
of germs of disease into stores, hotels,
Fchoolhousos and dwellings and taint the
air that the multitude must breathe.
There are closed carts for certain classes
of refuse; but there are many more that
are not closed. They are in motion con
etantly from sunrise until sunset. They
pass along Market street, Kearny street.
Mission street, Howard street, Folsom
street and all other principal thorough
fares of the city. Seventh street is the
scene of continual garbage menace. On
that street carts ; are gathered from all
sections of "the city, going to or return
ing from the garbage crematory, and the
winds have opportunity to disperse the
most deadly part of their contents, the
disease germs. They are covered not at
all or so flinisily covered that they lose a
part of their loads on the journey.
This is also true in ail the streets
through which they pass. It is particu
larly true of all the residence sections,
where the children of the poor and of
the rich are alike needlessly endangered.
While the Phelanized Board or Health

of the city and has been guilty of false
pretenses to fool the public a danger a
thousand times more to be feared than
the one that reached its official apotheosis
in the assassination of a guinea pig. and
a monkey is apparent to all observers.
But no member of the Board of Health
raiHf-s his voice to call a halt; no ap
potntÂ«e of Phelan braves the anger of his
official master pointing out that there
is an easy way to escape evident ills.
This is to have the garbage collected and
transported when the- people are not
stirrir:^; when the thousands of school
children are not on the streets or within
reach of possible infection. The Board
of Supervisors has the power to regulate
tli<- maner. Â«
If any modern scientific fact is estab
lished it is that germs account-for a great
variety of diseases and that the air car
ries the germs and Is, therefore, when it
is tainted, a powerful instrument for the
infection of great communities like San
Francisco. Reporters and artists em
ployed by The Call yesterday went on a
lour of inspection. They found open
garbage wagon* in all the principal
streets. Many of these were permitted to
stand for a long time in front of stores
and rr-s'iienct-s. entirely uncovered, with
the heat of the sun pouring down upon
them and with the wind blowing their
contents about. Crowds of people passed
an<l repasst-<l. Groups of children sported
near by. .Many pictures were taken, Â¦of
which a few are published this morning.
In all parts of the city the conditions ob
j served were practically the same.
On Kearny street. In the center of the
chopping district, in the middle of the
day, when many persons lined thp thor
oughfare, stood a scavenger cart filled to
overflowing. The unsavory contents
towered so high that the scavengers were
compelled to get on top of the load and
trample it down to keep it from entirely
blowing away.
On Folsom street two scavengers ha<l
a mixf-d mass of stuff to deal with, which
they had to level off with forks. The
odors emanating therefrom caused all
fiassers to hold their noses. Directly op
posite was Columbia Square, with hun
dreds of little children at play. In many
i.laces there were crowds of children near
Ihe reeking: scavenger carts and the pic
tures presented indicate the populous con
dition of some of the neighborhoods where
the views were taken.
. No first-class city deals with the matter
of health in this reckless fashion with the
exception of San Francisco. Amonp the
riiseases known to originate from germs
are th<Â» following: Tetanup, tuberculosis,
symptomatic anthrax, malaria, diphtheria,
glanders and rinderpest.
The Board of Health, falling to look af
\fr the collection of garbage under con
ditions threatening the least danger, de
serves to be publicly execrated and it will
be.

Preacher Editor Denounces People
Who Dodge the Tax Assessor
and Gives His Reason for
Doing So.
TOPEKA, Kans., March 15.â The fea
ture of the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon's pa
per to-morrow morning will be a cartoon
opposing the, war in the Philippines.. It is
the work of Myron A. Watterman, an
artist of considerable local fame and a
brother-in-law of, Mr. Sheldon. It repre
sents Uncle ! Sam dressed -in the uniform
of an officer 'of the United States army
with a smoking rifle: ln his hand, stand
ing in front" of an entrenchment in which
are a number of dead Filipinos, numerous
skulls being seen - in the distance.
Uncle "Sam and pointing to the
results of his marksmanship in the en
trenchments stands the Goddess of ! Lib
erty. She is represented as asking: "Is
this what you call your Christian civiliza
tion?" It, Will" be accompanied by a brief
editorial note denouncing war in general.
Mr. Sheldon left the editorial rooms for
an'hour and a half to-night to conduct the
regular mldweekly prayer meeting at his
church.
Rev. Mr. Sheldon, In the Capital, in de
nouncing those people who dodge the Tax
Assessor, made the statement that an At
chison., Topeka and Santa Fe baggage
man in Topeka pays three times as much
taxes as one of the highest officials of
the road." ;Â¦.'Â¦Â¦ Â¦ "Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â«
At the daily conference to-day with
newspaper correspondents, Mr. Sheldon
was asked why he did not publish the
names of those through whom he made
the comparisons, and replied:- "Because
the names are legion. This city is full of
that class of people and I did not think
it right to single out a half dozen Â¦ sin
ners and give their names. If I could
have given the entire list I might do so,
but that would bo impossible. I don t
know that I would print them anyway.
I am looking into the future and beyond
to remedy the evil and to persuade peo
ple to be more-honest in the matter of
assessment." ' '. Â¦
Asked if he holds that more rood can
be accomplished by creating public senti
ment against places of evil and evil
things, destroying the business and not
naming the guilty parties, Mr. Sheldon
said: â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ - -Â¦. .â¢'â¢ - Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢â¢ Â¦ ' "'Â¦*
"That is my idea. , I believe in training
the children right. I take the position
that it is cheaper to prevent crime than
to punish it. That is, the view I take in
my church and parish work. I believe if
we save the children the future is safe.
I don't say that I would not print the
names of evildoers if I were running a
paper permanently, but I do not deem it
best as I am running one for a week

GREEKS OF OLO
AND THEIR GODS
ABLY DISCUSSES
President "Wheeler on the
Unique Religion of the
Ancients.
BERKELEY, March 15.â President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the University of
California delivered an address on "Greek
Religion in Greek Art" before the Art
Association of the University of Califor
nia in Hearst Hall this evening. The lec
ture was illustrated by stereopticon views
of the buildings and points of interest in
Greece as developed through the excava
tiors during^'the past ten years.
Dr. Wheeler showed that the Greeks
made thf ir religion pre-eminent. All livAr
wonderful architectural monuments were
developed by their religious instincts. "No
j>eople was ever great," he said, "without
a religion. The religion of the Greeks was
omnipresent. Everything centered on re
ligion. His entire environment and lift;
was religious. The voice of God was in
everything. Unlike tlie Semetic God,
which is relegated to a distance and be
fore waom all bow, the Greek god was on
a par with his worshipers. The god wai
sought m 1m 1 dwellings and made one of the
family.
"The Greek showed respect to the gods
as fellow members cf the state and as
chief citizer.3 of the state. The state was
a. socio-rtiigious bond. Religion was not
,a matter of creeds and theologies, but
fellowship. To the Greek impiety was
treason and treason impiety. Any one
who offended any of the gx>ds created a
treason against the state.
"In the summer the gods in all their
plorv were entertained in the best style
the Greeks knew. As athletics was thÂ«*
life it was made the entertainment for
thf g-ods at their festivals."
Dr. Wheeler made a comparison between
the old Greek religion and that of to-day.
The Greek was on familiar terms, he
Bald, with his gods. He asked favors of
th^m as he would of a friend. He did not
bos- down to the last to something he
could not imagine. They had no devil as
we understand it. he said, and no god
lift*-*! up. but they always had the god
with them. Evil to their minds always
came mixed up with God in the personal
ity. Ti.rre is no word in Greek that means
good. There is no such thing as good. A
man may be just, but is never cailed
good. There were no good men. and,
above a. I. none who were cailed goody
goody. There, of course, came a time
when Gr.-ece tired of philosophy and a
time whr-ri they made A. distinction be
tween good and bad an we know it. Then
came the iirst intimation of sin. They, un
like us, put their gods on the stage nnd
threw ridicule at them. Gods like Apollo
which brought plenty to the land were
never made mirth of.
Views of the Acropolis, Parthenon and
familiar historical points of Greece, and
Athens particularly. werÂ» thrown on the
screen and described by President Wneel
cr. The beautiful Parthenon, with Its
wonderful cells, was minutely described.
"The builders of these magnificent tem
ples were no ordinary workmen," said he.
"They were of those whose equal for
alertness and architectural ability tb-s
world has never known."
In conclusion Professor Wheeler, who

VICTORIA, B. C, March 15. â On ac
count of the smallpox scare now prevail
ing in the north proclamations have been
published calling upon citizens to have
themselves vaccinated, and the medical
board is considering compulsory vaccina

tificates or marks are vaccinated by doc
tors who meet the trains and steamers.
Of course there is an anti-vaccination
party, and included in this party are the
Zionists, who are against not only vac
cination but doctors and medicines. Last
nignt Rev. Mr. Slddons of Vancouver lec
tured in Zion Tabernacle on the "Failure
and Iniquity of Vaccination." In the
course of the lecture the Zionist minister
began to quote statistics and then came
interrogations and interruptions and some
one shouted "You're lying." There was
an uproar then until when concluding hÂ»s
lecture the speaker said that any others
who wished to speak against vaccination
could have the platform.
Some one shouted, "TOJiat about the
other side?" and when he said that 4jiey
were barred the uproar was intensined.

WITNESS PRODUCED
THAT SLUMPED THE
FAIR ATTORNEYS
Mrs* James Gilleran Tells a Strong Story of
James G* Fair's Admission of Marriage
to Mrs. Nettie Craven.
Placed on the Stand and Subjected to Rigid and
Persistent Cross Examination by McEner
ney She Was Not Entangled.
WHEN Attorney Plerson said
"That is all." after he had
finished with his cross-examin
ation of Mrs. Sarah E. John
sen on Wednesday afternoon,
Lafe Pence, attorney for Mrs. Craven
*a:r, pledged his word to the court that
the attorneys for the petitioner would
Onuh their case on the morrow. The
morrow has come and gone and yet the
oetense is by no means at the end of its
case. Who is at fault is difficult to say.
The last witness of the day was a Mrs.
Janes Gilleran. proprietress of the El
Monte Hotel and formerly the landlady of
the Windsor House. She told a story that
Kept the attorneys for the respondents in
a stew of anxiety. Before adjournment
the had Garret McEnerney, who was in
charge cf the cross-battery fire yesterday
afternoon, in a cold perspiration and
floundering in a sea of confusion.
Never was a witnessâ and a woman at
thatâ more sure of her ground. Trippingly
from her tongue came the story of James
G. Fair's proclamation of the wifehood
cf Mrs. Nettie Craven. With aÂ»good run
r.inj; start McEnerney attempted to beat
tlifr field, but he died at the half-mile post
and reserved the right to further cross
question Monday morning when the case
will be resumed. Mrs. Gilleran left the
stand unperturbed and locke*. "vithin an
armor of apparent truth.
The morning session began with a con
tinuation of the cross-examination of H.
M. Bryant, the man of many homes. At
torney Pierson subjected him to a verbal
gattUas pun fire with, the result that
Bryant was gasping for breath before the
finish. Hardly had the trouble begun be
fore McEnerney. in answer to an objection
of one of the Pence brotherhood, jumped
to his feet and stridently shouted:
"We think the testimony of this wit
ness < s a fabrication and we wish to show
That the declaration that this man gave
$50 to jj U ne Payne, a woman whom he
knew but a week, is preposterous."
"'lf you work along those lines," retort
ed Charles Pence, "we might show sev
eral instances where attorneysâ and I
mention no names â of the c*Â»posite side
have given much more on a thorter ac- '
quaintance."
The cross-examination brought out that
Errant was any kind of a man in regard
to occupation. He delivered lectures on
the labor question, financial problems; '
was the founder of a Grand Army post; j
had serred four years in the war of the
rebellion; was an employe of the Santa Â¦
Ke Railroad and manager of the Pacific j
Grove Bank. His testimony concluded
with the recital of a scheme to secure his
signature to a paper on Wednesday even
ing at his Oakland home by some un
known party, who represented himself to
be an officer serving a subpoena.
"He was a big, corpulent man with a
black mustache, but I fooled him." eaid
Bryant.
"Ti-at's all." said Piexson, and Bryant
vent his way subject to recall.
Louis Whitcomb, reporter of the Chron
icle, was the next witness called. Charles
Pence claimed that the story printed In
that paper yesterday morning was a slur
end a bitter attack on the attorneys for
Mrs. Craven-Fair and likewise a contempt
of court. McEnerney objected to the ex
amination of Whitcomb, as it was a mat
ter extraneous to the case. Some hot !
argument ensued, with the finality that j
Whltcvmb was allowed to resume his re- I
portorial labors just as the trial was ad
journed until the afternoon session.
The matinee battle began by calling
.for several witnesses who did not put in
an appearance. The bailiff cried loud and
lustily for Mrs. Kate C. Plumber, but she
was not on deck to answer. Reuben H.
Lloyd was wanted by the Pcnces, and he,
too, was not within reach, so they quietly
announced that Mrs. James Gilleran
would be the next witness.
Mrs. Gilleran proved the best witness
for the petitioner's cause since the trial
began. She is a woman of strong Hiber
nian accent, with a positiveness of man
ner and speech that admitted of no bom
bardment. In her capacity as landlady
of the Windsor House she said that she
had seen Senator Fair In the rooms of
Mrs. Craven, who was stopping in her
house in July and August of 1592. On one
occasion when she was in the room to
drape a mantel lambrequin Mrs. Craven
and Senator Fair were present. Mrs.
Craven and Mrs. Gilleran were working
over the mantel decoration and Senator
Fair was sitting on the sofa when the fol
lowing conversation ensued:
"Are you married to him?" said Mrs.
Gilleran.
Mrs. Craven then turned to Senator Fair
and said:
"Did you hear that. James? She wants
to know if we are married."
"What's that?" responded the Senator,
and when the question was repeated by
Mrs. Craven he replied, laughingly: "XVs,
we are, and why shouldn't we be? My
children have all gone back on me nnd
Mrs. Craven is a good woman. Didn't I
do right?" And then Pence turned th*
witness over to McEnerney, who conduct
ed the cross-examination.
For two hours that legal luminary kept
Mrs. Gilleran on the prill, eliciting a
wealth of testimony that strengthened the
petitioner's side of thÂ« case. She was
a "hard customer" and McEnerney got
the worst of the bargain. Question after
question, thrown at her with expected de
structive force was repelled with an in
stinctive wit that made the attorneys of
the respondents perspire mentally. Mrs.
Gilleran told of the visits of Fair to Mrs.
Craven in the Windsor House: of a meet
ing on Montgomery street when the pe
titioner and the Senator, arm in arm.
walked lovingly over the pavements; of
money sent through herself to Mrs. Cra
ven, who was stopping at the California
Hotel, and much other Interesting stuff
about the close association of the two.
"I saw him go In her room at least
twenty times," said Mrs. Gilleran. and
she recalled the individual meetings with
great exactness.
Badgered as she was by McEnerney the
witness did not display any confusion or
ill temper. When asked if she had signed
anj- contract for recompense for testify
ing she indignantly remarked that Mr.
McEnerney knew her too well for that.
The attorney said he did not. This aroused
Mrs. Gilleran and she related the visits
of Judge Lawlor. Thomas Flynn and Mc-
Ererney himself.
Disclaiming: any interest in the trial it
self Mrs. Gilleran said it was against her
will that she was called in to testify.
"I foolishly remarked before Senator
Morehouse. his wife and daughter. Dr.
Reickart and Dr. Bardu at my hotel, the
El Monte, that I knew of the marriage of
Senator Fair and Mrs. Craven. That was
the mistake. Soon after I was visited by
the Pence?, but I would not be inter
viewed. Then I was subpenaed and here
I am."
McEnerney persistently fired away at
the witness. She admitted an acquaint
ance with Martin Kelly; but disclaimed
any connection with him in regard to this
case. She said that she had spoken of her
knowledge about the relationship of Mrs.
Craven and Senator Fair to but very* few.
At this point the hour for adjournment
had arrived and Judge Troutt called the
case off until Monday, when Attorneys
Plerson and McEnerney will risk another
sheaf of shafts at the buxom landlady.

SHARP DEBATE
OVER THE BOLL
PEN INQUIRY
First Witness on Behalf
of the Defense
Testifies.
Refuses to Answer a Question Put by
Lentz Which Is Characterized.
by Stevens as Absurd and
Nonsensical.
WASHINGTON, March 15.â Although
the direct testimony In the Coeur d'Alene
investigation before the House Commit
tee on Military Affairs Is not yet closed,
the prosecuting witnesses temporarily
gave place to-day to. the first witness not
identilied with those bringing ,the charges.
This was J. H. Forney, the special prose
cuting officer, who directed the cases be
fore the Coroner's jury and the Grand
Jury at the seat of the disorder. He said,
he had been a prosecuting official for sev-.
enteen years, and. was especially ap
pointed in this case by the Attorney Gen
eral of Idaho.
The witness said the Coroner's investi
gation, which was much criticized on the
direct examination, was conducted in the
usual way and in accordance withy the
law. The jury not only investigated the
deaths resulting from the riot of April 29,
but also the conspiracy leading up to that
demonstration. The theory that a con
spiracy existed gave the inquiry a broad
scope. Mr. Forney said, however, that no
force, violence or intimidation was used
toward the witnesses. Concerning the
prisoners in the "bull pen," Mr. Forney
said they were not held under any specific
charges,- but by virtue of the Governor's
proclamation declaring that the county
was in a state of insurrection.
This was in accordance with the law,
he said, which provided that In case of
insurrection the Governor may appoint a
special officer with an armed force to take
charge of affairs.
The witness was examined at length on
thÂ» legal rights involving the suspension
of the writ of habeas carpus, etc. He said
the writ- had not been suspended In Idaho
although the action of the. Governor and
the holdings of the courts might have had
that practical effect. He maintained,
however, that the denial of a writ of ha
beas corpus in particular cases did -not
operate as a general suspension, of 'the
system. The cross-examintlon by Lentz
and Sulzer was directed to show that
the Attorney General of Idaho demurred
to the application of habeas corpus and
In effect held that the writ was sus
pended.
A heated controversy arose over the hy
pothetical .Question by Lentz as to
whether if a sister of charity: had been
put in the "bull pen" she could have se
cured a writ of habeas corpus. Â¦' â¢ Â¦ '
The answer was that no such condition
could have existed. Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦ . ?:- --. ;
When Lentz pressed the question, Stev
ens of Minnesota sharply- protested that
the question was "absurd and nonsensi
cal." " 'Â¦-;: : . Â¦ - *
Lentz declared the witness was seeking
to evade. the question, whereupon the wit
ness turned to the Ohio member. and said:
"I am perfectly honest In this matter, I
\jant you to understand, sir."
The witness finally declined to 1 answer I
the Question further. v - J
Representative Hay of Virginia raised
the point that this placed the witness In
contempt, and asked for a vote on hold-
Ing the witness to be in contempt.
A controversy of half an hour followed,
bringing frequent sharp and rather per
sonal exchanges between Marsh of Illi
nois and Lentz of Ohio.. The question was
finally changed and the controversy
closed.
When the witness was asked as to his
politics Jett of Illinois Inquired if the in
vestigation was to be on political lines.
Marsh answered that in his opinion the
Investigation was conceived and executed
for political purposes. Â¦ >

TRAMPS ROB A STORE.
Arrested by, Officers and the Stolen
Goods Recovered.
CORNING, March 15.â A party of tramps
gained entrance to B. J. Morey's bicycle
and jewelry store at this place at about 9
o'clock last night and succeeded In carry-
Ing off a large number of watches, rings
and other articles. Mr. Mbrey was ab
sent from his stcre at the time and did not
become aware of the robbery until an
hour or so after the thieves had departed.
The officers were notified and a search
at once began for the robbers. Constable
W. Hart succeeded in finding them near
Tehama. He also recovered nineteen of
the stolen watches. After daybreak this
morning a more thorough hunt was made
for the rest of the stolen goods. Three
watches and seventeen rings were found
near the place where the arrest was made.
The prisoners are now In jail at this place
awaiting trial. The same gang of tramps
resisted arrest at Orland a day previous
to their arrival in Corning, overpowered
the constable of that place, handcuffed
his hands behind his back and pinned his
star on the back of his coat. The evi
dence of their guilt is so conclusive that
a speedy conviction is assured.

tion of a Pacific cable to Hawaii, the
Philippines and Japan were filed to-day

private auspices, the Government paying

A minority report, signed by Represent
atives Adamson. Adams, Shackleford and
Davey. dissents in toto from the bill. An
other minority report signed by Repre
sent atives Corliss, Fletcher and Stewart
opposed the plan of private ownershij
and proposed a substitute embodying the
Idea of Government ownership of thÂ«,
cable. Still another dissenting report is
from Mann of Illinois, giving his individ
ual view that a Government cable woula
prove more beneficial to the public and
the Government.
Sherman'f majority report is an ex
haustive review of the cable question It
fays that the argument for a Government
cabkÂ« thut would be under the complete
control of the I'nited States seems of
fmall Importance to the committee except
in time rt war. and in that event the.
Government Is authorized to assume con
trol of the private cable which the com
mittee recommends.
As to the Government cable being more
economical to the I'nited States the re
port says that this loses weight from the
necessity of establishing a duplicate
cable.

MURDERER WILCOX SAYS
HE EXPECTS TO HANG

Special Dispatch to The Call. *
SANTA ROSA. March 15.-George F.
Wllcoxj the felf-cbnfessed wife murderer,
now occupies a cot In his cell at the Coun
ty Jail and is either feigning illness or is
a very sick man. He seems to have given
up hope and admitted to a Call represent
ative to-day Â¦ that he expected to swing
for his crime.
In his statement yesterday Wilcox said
that he shot his wife three timea, detail
ing with great care the exact spot at
which the. bullets entered her prostrate
form. 'The testimony introduced before
the Coroner's jury was that on examina
tion the body had revealed buf one gun
shot wound. "; Â» :.-â¢â¢ .5-
This morning "Wilcox was taken from

of the Superior Court, where he was ar
raigned. His plea was set for to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock, j Wllcox's father,
who resides at Pasadena, has arrived here
and will do what he can to assist his son.
It is understood that Attorney Emmet
Seawell has been retained to appear for
the defense.
In discussing the matter to-day the old
man said: "My boy fairly worshiped his
wife and I know that he would not have
harmed a hair of her head for the world
if he had been in his right mind. He
loved. her too well for that. - The boy is
sick, and even If he escapes punishment
will not have long to live. He has been
failing very fast ever since a severe at
tack of typhoid fever which, visited htm
last wlntfr."
Sheriff Grace is in somewhat of a quan
dary what to do In the matter of the $100
reward offered for Wllcox's capture. Two
people claim the reward. One of them Is
the prisoner's stepmother, who fays she
notified the Pasadena authorities as soon
as Wilcox arrived at' his father's home.
The other Is Marshal ' Lacy of Pasadena,
who made the arrest. The sum will prob
ably be divided between the two claim
ants. "

THREATEIS THE
POLICY OF THE
"OPEN DOOR"
Attitude of the Empress
Viewed With Much
Alarm.
Warship From Manila Will Be Dis
patched to Subdue Attacks on
Missionaries by Chinese
Anti-Foreijjn League.
SHANGHAI, March 15.â The American
Association here to-day telegraphed to
the I'nited States Government that the
attitude of the Empress Dowager toward
the reformers will upset the '"open door"
policy. They also say rebellion and
anarchy are expected to the detriment of
foreign internets, and advocate prompt
concerted action on the part of the
powers.
The China Association will appeal to the
liritish Minister, Sir Claude M. Macdon
ala. on the came subject,
WASHINGTON, March 15.â The cable
gram from the American Association has
Uven received at the State Department.
It has not yet been acted upon, but is un
der serious consideration. At tirst read
ing it is not clear just what connection
exists between the attitude of the Chi
nese Empress Dowager toward the re
form element lv China and the "open
door' policy, in which the United States,
with tiie remainder of the civilized world,
is interested. It is recalled, however, that
the Empress Dowager is persecuting with
irleiulet-s hatred the reform party, going
Â«= o far as to resurt to the baroarous prac
tice of offering a large sum of money foi
the assassination of leading reformers.
This reJorm element in China is believed
to include nearly all of the Chinese who
are disposed to elevate China into a civ
ilized nation, following in the footsteps
of Japan. They realize that this can only
be done with the help of foreigners, and
tre theretore disposec to the "open door"
as one of the measures to liberalize and
enlighten China through the introduction
of foreign capital and foreign methods.
It Is assumed that the basis of this repre
sentation from the American Association
is an apprehension that the Conservative
party surrounding the Empress Dowager,
in eatisfying their animosity against the
rcfomers, will excite the dormant anti
foreign feeling among the masses of Chi
nese to a degree that will make the "open
door" Impossible of attainment.
Minister Fails to Report.
It is a curious fact that our Minister to
China, Mr. Conger, has so far made no
representations to the State Department
touching this subject. He has reported
to the department that serious attacks
have been made upon the American mis
sions in Shantung by the "Boxers." a
powerful and numerous anti-foreign
league of Chinese. It is this same organi
sation which has attacked some of the
French missionaries in that quarter of
China and hap even carried operations to
the very doors of Kiaochau, the German
holding in North China. Upon the Minis
ter's representation the State Depart
ment ha* decided that an American war
ship fhall be dispatched from the fleet at
Manila to the nearest convenient port to
the seat of discord, probably in this case
Taku. at the mouth of the I'eiho River, or
Wei-H.ii-Wei. It Is expected, however,
that the Chinese Government will be able
to repress the "Boxers" without any ac
tion <m the part of the American warship.
It is distinctly understood that this lit
tle naval demonstration will have no con
nection with the struggle now going on
between the Empress Dowagers party
and the reformers, for this may be regard
ed as a matter of purely internal policy,
with which our Government has no right
to concern itself. It is probable therefore
that this decision on our part indicates
the character of the response that will be
made by the Department of State to the
cablegram from the American Associa
tion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1900.
NEW WARSHIPS
PROVIDED FOR
BY COMMITTEE
Â¦ ? Â¦ â â
House. Bill Ready Making
an Appropriation of
' $22,623,000.
Two Sea-Going Line
Three Armored Cruisers and
Three Protected Cruisers
Included in the Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 15.â The House!
Committee on Naval Affairs reached a
definite and final decision to-day as to the
number of new warships to be authorized
in the forthcoming: naval appropriation
bill, as follows:
Two sea-going coast line battleships of
about 13,500 ; tons each, to cost approxi
mately $3,C00,000 each;, three armored
cruisers of the highest practical speed and
most powerful armor and armament, to
cost approximately $4,000,000 each; three
protected cruisers, to cost about $1,141,000
each. - _ . â j
It was determined not to provide any
gunboats, in view of the opinion expressed
by Secretary Long and Admiral Dewey !
that General Otis' recent purchases of ser
viceable boats of this character met pres
ent gunboat requirements.
The committee decided to authorize the
Secretary of the Navy to contract tor
armor at a price not to exceed $315 per
ton. This applies tQ the emergency armor,
about 7400 tons, required for the battle
ships Maine, Missouri and Ohio, now k
course of construction, and not to the ves
sels authorized but not begun nor to those
contemplated by the present bill.
The question of sheathing ships, which
has excited much interest in naval circles
of late, was determined by adopting a
provision leaving the question of sheath
ing to .the discretion of the Secretary of
the Navy. Prior to the action on the bill
rsaval Constructor Capps, who served
with Admiral Dewey in the Phllipplres,
was heard on the sheathing question. He
urged In particular that vessels to be u?ed
in foreign service should be sheathed, as
foreign drydocks were not always avail
able. ;
'The committee did not provide specifical
ly for the building of any of the new ships
in Government yards, as has been urged
by delegations from Brooklyn and else
where, so that it is expected that the
usual provisions as to building will be In
serted in the bill, with possibly some dis
cretionary power with the Navy Depart
ment as to utilizing Government yards for
this purpose. ' . .
The decisions of to-day practically com
plete the bill, although there is still a
week's work in' preparing the formal lan
guage executing the determination of the
committee as expressed to-day.

4ner out from the moment the latter drop
ped to his knees Instead of directing all
his efforts to keeping me at a safe distance
from my oupnnent. This happened In th*
first round, ana Steizner profited by it as
the g.ov.K saved him; and when it was' re
peated in the second round I shov.-ed my
disapproval of such tactics by insisting on
striking Stelrner as he was about to rise
from his knees. As this occurred after the
sound of the bell, which I did not hear
I was Justly disqualified by the referee
I bet, approximately, my entire end of the
| p-jrse on myself to win in the first flTe
j rounds of the contest, and any fair-minded
I onlooker could readily see that that was
my aim from the moment hostilities com
menced. I am thoroughly satisfied with the
action of the referee, both in declaring bets
oft and In the eentlemanly way In which
he fulfilled his duty to the best of his abil
ity. I certainly object to the methods em
ployed by the manag-crs of the National
Athletic Club in handling their boxing con
tests These. Ido not hesitate to state, are
like those used in highway robbery They
were not satisfied with the proceeds of their
â¢ tricky way of handling the irate receipts
which are the property of the contestants
according to the articles of agreement, but
they jrrasD at the filmsical pretext to de
| clare the event no contest and appropriate
the entire rate receipts, reeardiess of all
contracts and obligations to the contrary
Messrs Gibbs and Grcom will find before
I am through with them what their obliga
tions are and will no doubt profit by this
. experience. JOSEPH BUTLER.
J. D. Gibbs, as manager of the National
I Club, contributed this statement:
The statement that the Xational Club
management played the Rate receipts or
played any sum whatsoever on the recult
of list nicht's contest is absolutely false
! and unfounded. The National club would
| not countenance faking and has tried time
> and aealn to Prevent It. When It was ln
i formed that the bettinc switched In such
a. way ag to make it manifest that a fake
had l-een arranied it Instructed Referee
Jack Welch to declare all bets off. and he
carried out such Instruction. The author
of the statement must have been actuated
by ma.ice. otherwise he would not make
a statement which he knows Is false. If
j the r*-rson lives who can prove the chanre
made acainst the mynngernent of the -Na
tional Club let him step forward.
Th'? statement ttat poolsellers Intimidated
the club Into calllnc bets off is as false as
the rtatement that (fate receipts were played
on the results. We were influenced by a
sense of rlrht and Justice tr> our patrons.
I whom we have catered to for years, and
whom we learn through the press have at
. different times been Imncsed upon by un
scrupulous flchr*rs. The supposed fake on
this occasion was Â«o caloable that we knew
we would be dclnff an Injustice to nobody
and at the r2me timÂ» we would be nro
tectlnir the bÂ«ttlns public by having* all
bets declared o.f. After bets had been
declared off the club directors felt assured
that the men would then put up an honest
contest, but much to our astonishment the
fake was carried out. Hutler. In the ex
citement, deliberately fouUM his opponent.
thereby carrying out his infamous contract
with un?cruT'ilous touts. Under the?e clr-
I cumstances 'he directors decided not to pay
them a dollar for thÂ»lr Jobbery, and we
think it will be a lasting; lesson to men of
Butler's stamp.
The representative of Butler makes the
unqualified statement that he was ap
prnached by J. J. Groom of the National
Club and asked to use his influence with
Butler to have the bout last eight rounds
Whether this was part of the scheme to
rob the betting public he does not *say
Mr. Groom denies making this request, so
the Incident resolves itself into a ques
tion of veracity. It develops that Charles
Newman held thÂ«> gate receipts, which dlÂ«
firove3 the story that this money was bet
n the poolrooms.
TRYING TO FIND
WHERE WHITTELL
REALLY BESIDES
Residence of the Clubman a
Moot Point Before the
Federal Court.
"Is George Whlttell a resident of San
Francisco or of New York?" is the prob
lem which United States Circuit Judge
Morrow will endeavor to solve wlthm the
next few weeks. He has just finished the
taking of testimony and the reading of
depositions bearing upon that important
Issue. The matter in issue is whether
the Federal court has jurisdiction in the
case of Ellen A. Fife and George S FlrV
her husband, against George Whlttell the
well-known society and club man The
suit was brought some time ago in the
Superior Court, but upon a showing made
by Mr. Whitteil to the effect that he had
shaken the dust of San Francisco off bis
feet the case was removed to the L'nittd
States Circuit Court. Now the plaint*if
come in with the contention that Whitteil
has never abandoned his residence in this
city and that therefore the Federal courts
have no jurisdiction.
The case involves the disposition of the
estate left by the late Nicholas Lumn*
who died on August 11. ISM. leaving an es
tate valued at $7,245,000. and Whlttell and
Marlon B. Langhorne were appointed ex
ecutors.
Mrs. Fife, a daughter of the deceased
and sister of Mrs. Whlttell. alleges tint
the value of her portion of the estate was
$1.200.0j0 In money, stocks and bonds pn-1
$200,000 In real estate, and avers that Whit
tell induced her to transfer all her right
title and Interest to a corporation formed'
by the heirs and called the ,Luning Com
pany. She avers that she was afterward
lnformf-d by Whittell that the value of
her Interest In the company had shrunk to
$700,000. She accordingly asks for a judg
ment for $750.362 as damages.
Mr. Whlttell introduced witnesses before
Judge Morrow to prove that he was a
recognized club man In New York City
and a resident of that place. Dr. W. X
Hopkins told of declaration." made by Mr!
Whittell of his intention to remove to New
York and to become a permanent resident.
Mr. Whittell on cross-examination ad
mitted that he went to New York 'n the
first Instance to avoid service In onÂ» of
the Luning suits, but that he at that time
also intended to make that metropolis his
permanent residence.
Joseph D. Grant told about a conversa
tion that he had had with Whittell i* io
the superior advantages oftereVi by ths
Eastern metropolis for a business mun
with great energy and capital.
Mrs. Fife testified that the Whlttell resi
dence, on the southwest corner of Califor
nia and Jones streets, was still kepÂ» up
with the necessary retinue of servants
which was evidence to her that Mr. Whit
tell had not abandoned his San Francisco
residence.

. the Senate.
Trouble Arose Over a Discussion on
the Fixing of a Time. to Vote
on the Quay Question in
the Upper House.
Â»
WASHINGTON, March 15.â "1 assert
most emphatically- that when the Senator
says I told him I should not speak on
w.is subject, he does not state the truth."
This was the sensational retort made
in the Senate to-day by Galllncrer (R.) of
New Hampshire to a statement just made
by Penrose of Pennsylvania. Senators
were astounded and the auditors In the
galleries quivered with excitement. There
had scarcely been the slightest intimation
that the debate would take such a turn.
For nearly three hours the Senate had
under discussion the bill appropriating
J2.095.000 fcr the benefit of the people of
Porto Rico. Fairbanks of Indiana had
just concluded some remarks on the meas
ure and suggested tÃat the Senate pro
ceed to the consideration of executive
ousiness. Pending a motion to that ef
fect. Penrose. who has charge of the case
cf former Senator Quay, suggested that
a time be fixed for a vote on tne case. In
the course of his remarks he Intimated !
that certain Senators were throwing ob
stacles in the way of a vote and Indicated
that Galllnger was one of these Senators.
quietly replied that he desired
to be heard on the question, but had not
had an opportunity to speak.
To his statement Penrose retorted that
the New Hampshire Senator had assured
him he did not expect to speak on the
Quay case.
Instantly Gatlinger was on his feet, and
with evident feeling and with great ve
hemence, replied as quoted in the fore
going.
"I don't know whether I don't speak
the truth." hotly replied Penrose. "or
whether the Senator from New Hamp
shire failed to tell me the truth."
The proposition to tix-a time for a vote
was postponed untU to-morrow, but it was
some time before the excitement subsided.
The debate- on the armropriatlon bUI de
veloped a decided difference of opinion, as
Jones (D.) of Arkansas offered as a sub
stitute for the measure a bill to return
the duties to those who had paid them
and providing for absolute free trade be
tween the United States and Porto Rico.
'me bill had not been disposed cf when
t_e Quay case was called up.
The District of Columbia appropriation
bill carrying Se.COS.SSS was passed by the
nouse to-day and also a b'll granting the ]
abandoned Fort Hayes military reserva- i
tlon to the State of Kansas for an ex
perimental station and normal school pur
poses. I
NEW HAVEN GIRL
ENDS LONG SLEEP
Strange Seven Weeks' Trance Into Which a
Young Woman Fell After an
Extended Waltz.
NEW HAVEN. March 13.â After lying nearly seven weeks In a trance, caused
by excessive indulgence in dancing, Miss Pauline Fitzgerald has awakened and
askM for food. .
"I have had such a nice dream." she said. "I thought I was waltzing for
hours ar.l hours. I never seemed to tire. But now that I awake I feel tired and
hungry."'
Dance music was recently tried with partial success to awaken Miss Fitzger
ald. The experiment was tried at the sugeestion of the Springside Home, whither
the yo-jr.g woman r.-as conveyed from the home of Mrs. Fred Grant.
When tH<? familiar strain? of a waltz fell upon her ear the girl made spas
modic movements and her lips moved in efforts to articulate. But she soon re
lar.-^d ir.tn Â«tupor.
MiÂ« Fitzgerald's ca^e has attracted the attention of several physicians, who
were present when her cot was moved into the parlor of the Springside Home,
while an attendant experimented with dance music at the piano.
The authorities at the Springsjde Home repeatedly tried, hyponotism, but all
efforts of this kind produced no result.
When Miss Fitzgerald finally awoke she was so weak that her physicians
would allow her to talk but little. To a correspondent she said:
"I can't realize that I have been asleep over six weeks. It seems only like a
lor.g night. I have no recollection of my dreams except that I seemed to be al
ways whirling to the sound of music.

ON THE PRESIDIO LINKS.
Qualifying Round of Council's Cup
for Women Will Be Played
To-Day.
A competition- over eighteen holes,
medal play, was held yesterday among
eight caddies of the San Francisco Golf
Club, who had previously qualified by
making the lowest scores over nine holes,
medal play. The prizes offered were sets
of golf clubs, but the contest turned out
unsatisfactory from the lack of scorers to
keep tab on the boys. No award was
made of the prizes, but a competition will
probably be held at some later day.
To-day the qualifying round, over eight
een holes, medal play, of the competition
for the Council's cup, for women, will be
held on the Pres'dto links. All score
cards must be signed by a scorer and
handed In at the clubhouse before sunset
The eight ladies who make the lowest
scores will be entitled to enter the first
round for the cup. which will be played
on Monday, March 13. The semi-finals
will be played Wednesday, the 21st. and
the finals Friday, the 23d.
Trance Shot.
: PETALUMA. March 13.â Imported
Trance, a celebrated mare, was shot at
the Reinhart stock farm. Glen Ellen, yes
terday after breaking a leg.
"This, ladles and gentlemen. Is the cele-
brated trick donkey. Dot." said the clown,
as the animal was being led into the ring.
"After many years of most patient effort
I am able to say that I can make him do
anything he wants to."
FANNING'S NEW RECORD.
Calif ornian Makes 175 Straight Kills
at the Traps.
NEAV YORK. March 15.â Jack Fanning,
the crack wing shot of California, created
a newcontinuous match record at the traps
on Madison Square Garden roof to-day,
breaking 175 inanimate targets straight.
This record was accomplished without a
rest.
Although Farming's record .of 173
straight kills has been surpassed, it has
never been accomplished before in a con
tinuous match. The best record of straight
kills is 213. but the record was made" in
different events, that Is. the shooter made
straight kills in several different events,
resting between each event.
Farming's record is exceptionally brilliant
In view of the fact. that It was accom
plished in -the face of a blinding smw
storm. His miss, the one hundred ani
seventy-sixth straight, was comparatively
easy, but was lost through carelessness.
Another phenomenal record was nuns up'
on the rifle range by L. F. Ross of the
Elite Rifle' Club of Brooklyn. Rosa estab
lished a new record of 2429 out of a possi
ble 2500 points. He held the best previous
record of 2425, made at Madison Square
Garden last year.

The bout between Boxers Butler and

a blew from which it will not recover for

Butler took up his pen and addressed the

Lenny's finish, In the opinion of the fight-
Ing men present', nad the appearance ol
his having quit.
The first knock-down was the only hard
punch of this round, beln? a swinging
right on the local man's jaw. He took the
full ten seconds, and then McGovern
rushed at him with his usual speed and
with a couple -of light body blows sent
him to the floor again. The . local man
again took the full time in coming up.
when after a couple of passes Terry land
ed a light tody blow on Lenny, following
it up with a right on the jaw. Lenny was
then counted out. ,"
The saml-wlnd-up was between Tommy
Feltz of Brooklyn and Jack Landing of
Camden at ICS pounds. It was a spirited
struggle from the start to the end of the
fifth round, when the Brooklyn man
forced Lansing to the edge of the ring
and with a light punch sent Lansing
through the ropes and he fell to the floor.
The fall Jarred Lansing considerably and
he said he was tco weak to continue.
Feltz had clearly the better of the go. his

A MASSACHUSETTS ABERRATION.
piZjROM several of our Eastern exchanges we learn
I k that a Judge in Massachusetts recently permitted
* a young criminal found guilty of forgery to go
free on condition that he would keep out of Massachu
setts for two years. It appears the Judge regards two
years' banishment from that commonwealth as
equivalent to two years in the State prison, and his
action was based upon that view of the case.
Our Eastern contemporaries, published in States
outside of the :New England group, denounce the ac
tion of the Judge in severe ternis. From the tone of
their remarks we- infer that they look* upon the sen
tence of the Judge as conferring a reward upon the
criminal instead of. a punishment, but their main ob
jection is that Massachusetts is becoming altogether
too thrifty and economical in the dealing with her
criminals. Conceding that to a Boston forger an
exile from the State for two years is really as painful
as two years in the penitentiary, there remains in that
form of punishment the objectionable element that
instead of taking charge of the criminal herself for
that length of time, Massachusetts puts him off upon
some other State.
. It appears California has a particular interest in the
case,' for the Baltimore American, in commenting
upon it, states incidentally as a minor feature of it
that the young criminal's father promised the Judge
to send him to California and keep him there for the
full term of the two years. Possibly the young man
may turn out well and develop here a virtue he did
not possess at home. Such things frequently happen.
All the same, we would prefer to obtain our immi
giants in another way.
International law and formal treaties forbid one
Government from getting rid of its criminal class. by
banishing convicts to exile, in another country. We
have frequently had to complain of European Gov
ernments in that respect, and now we keep a close
watch to see that no nation uses any part of the
United States as a dumping-ground for persons con
victed of crime. It will be a sad day. if one Ameri
can State should have to stand on guard in the same
way against another State. It was quite common, in
deed, at one time, for Eastern communities', to rid
themselves of certain kinds of criminals by permit
ting them to go free on condition they would set out
for Texas or California. The customs of that day
have long. since been outgrown, and it is to be re
gretted a Massachusetts Judge has seen fit to under
take to revive them. Had he sentenced the forger to
banishment to Great Britain or Germany, his conduct
would have been the subject of an international con
troversy at once, and it would seem that there should
be some law to protect California as well as foreign
countries from such exhibitions of Massachusetts
thrift. . ; ' \ :
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
ANOTHER BRYAN INVASION.
/"^ALIFORNIA is destined to more'trouble. .We
( have had drought, floods, fires and the San
'^Â¦^ Francisco Board of Health, Phelan's reform
government and the Examiner as an endemic disease
and now it is announced that Bryan impends once
more! I He is to begin in Washington, put his well
worn figures of speech on the Puget Sound market
and then, beginning in Southern California, will go
through the State like a liver regulator.
He selects Southern California at a time when the
tourist crop is harvested and gathered into barns and
the people will have settled down to figure out the ef
fects of a prolonged dry spell. He does' not appear
as a rain-maker. He depends upon an anhydrous
atmosphere and withered fields. Where nature has
foreclosed upon the ordinary fruits and farinacea there
he is with the people, to charge the famine of the fields
to the party in power. The Gulf stream and the Japan
current in their normal position are his enemies. His
allies are the weevil and cut worm, thrips. San Jose
scale, red spider and curled leaf. The Vedalia Aus
tralis he views with alarm and points with pride to the
cushiony cotton scale.
Though the gold standard bill is the law and our 2
per cent bonds are at a premium of 7 per cent and
the money circulation per capita is greater than ever
before, as is the stock of gold, he scents ruin in the air
because our standard of value. is not a silver dollar
worth 50 cents and our bonds are not at a discount
instead of a premium.
Just why Colonel Bryan feels it necessary to quit his
Nebraska fireside in the bracing March weather and
put his gift of prophecy on tap in the cities of the
coast and plains is not explained.
We suspect that the cause may be found in the re
cent cynical and zoological remark of Hon. Sylvester
Pennoyer of Oregon, a veteran in free silver politics,
who says that Bryan is using the same weapon that
served Samson in his little trouble with the Philistines.
Mr. Pennoyer is of the opinion that Samson was the
only artist in the use of that means of overcoming an
enemy and that Bryan plies his jawbone in vain. Bi
this as it may, his visit will greatly refresh the weary
brethren and put life and mettle in the heels of those
who run to politics.
He will diagnose the trust disease and suggest him
self as the only pill which will purge it out of the na
tional constitution. Â¦ After urging on the Spanish war
"because it would be good politics" and securing the
ratification of the purchase of the Philippines when
Republican Senators had it beaten, he will oppose that
imperialism which Senators McLaurin of South Caro
lina, Morgan of Alabama and other leaders of his
party 'declare is the proper caper for this country. His
organ here, the Examiner, which nailed the flag to the
Philippines, and declared that Congress can govern
external possessions without regard to the consti
tution, will lead the claque in favor of his anti-expan
sion oratory and the full band will respond to his
ancient battle cry of 16 to 1.
Meantime sober-minded people, who believe in
principles and not opportunism in politics, will note
that he attacks everything that is and makes no feas
ible suggestion of anything better to take its place.
They will see no remedy for any existing evil in giving
the country over to him and Altgeld, Tillman, Croker,
Fred White, Governor Waite, General Weaver and the
crowd of anarchist agitators whose past records brand
them as incompetent in government and unsafe in
politics. The steady heads and hands of the country
must plan a way out of existing complications and
then carefully work that plan out to a finish. Oppor
tunism never yet furnished good government to any
country, which must be the fruit of the steady and pa
tient application of fixed principles to public issues.
Colonel Bryan admits that the constitution must be
amended to cover an income tax and his anti-trust
legislation. He also adheres to the Chicago platform
attack on the Supreme Court, which requires another
amendment to the constitution to change the method
of choosing that great bench and destroy the life ten
ure of its members. It is plain therefore that Colonel
Bryan's politics is extra-constitutional and that every
policy of importance which he advocates is at war
with our present constitutional system. It Is for our
steady people to say whether they will put into hi?
hands the power to sew patches in the constitution
until it will look like a beggar's gaberlunzie for sale at
Rag Fair.
The wisdom of the fathers who made the consti
tution has been approved by the history of a century
and eleven years of prosperous and successful govern
ment under it. But Colonel Bryan is not pleased with
that great fundamental law and desires to amend it
awry with its purposes. He desires to smash the watch
to make it keep better time. We are persuaded that
the people p-efer to let it stand as great men made it
and not trust its amendment to the clowns and harle
quins who train in Colonel Bryan's perpetual, peri
patetic show. "

THE DOMESTIC SERVANT PROBLEM
\A RS. EMMONS BLAINE, daughter of Cyrus
/ \ G. McCormick, inventor of the reaping ma
* * chine, and daughter-in-law of James G." Blaine,
has contributed to the solution of the domestic ser
vant problem an experiment which shows on her part
something of the inventive genius of her father and
something of the wide-reaching diplomacy of her
father-in-law. Her plan is to provide for her house
hold two sets of sen-ants, one to report for duty at 6
a. m. and to leave 3t 2 p. m., the other to begin work
when the first set leaves and continue until 10 p. m.
Thus each set will work but eight hours a day and
will have ample leisure for work, study, recreation, so
cial enjoyment or anything else in the way of occupa
tion they may choose to undertake on their own be
half.
The boldness of. the experiment lies in the fact that
when put into operation the system will leave the
household without servants from 10 p. m. to 6 a. m.
Should there be need for service of any kind in the
house between those hours the members of the family
or their guests will do it or it will remain undone.
Visitors will be requested not to remain after 10
o'clock, gucsts'will be instructed not to call for supper
or hot water or anything else after that hour' and all
babies in the mansion will be restrained from crying
for nurses or for lollypop until the first set of servants
come on in the morning.
It appears in fact that the Emmons Blame house
hold is to be managed something like a factory or a
shop. The work of its manifold activities is to be car
ried on strictly within business hours. Promptly

DEMOCRACY AND PORTO RICO.
* IGHTEEN months ago the Examiner an
nounced as good Democracy that: "Should it
â * become necessary to administer outside depend-
L-ncits, it is in the power and right of Congress to
ievise any sort of system that may appl., to the con
htions of such dependencies and this power ii in no
.vise limited by the national constitution, nor does its
implication involve any modification in our domestic
?vstem. All these things are familiar knowledge."
On October 3. 1809, in an editorial on the re
ception of Admiral Dewey in New York, the Ex
aminer's twin, Hearst's New York Journal, made it
plain that we are to govern "outside dependencies."
Under the caption, "Expansion in the Air," the
Journal said in big pica type and double-column form:
"What does it all mean? Why has Admiral Dewey,
who thrashed an enemy from whom the country was
never in danger, been welcomed with transports of
enthusiasm that were never evoked by the older heroes
who saved the nation in its struggles for existence?
"What the welcome really means, aside from appre
ciation of the charm of Dewey's personality, is that
the vast mass of Americans approve with all their
fouls the consequences of his victory. As for the
victory itself, as a mere feat of arms, that plays a
minor part in the rejoicings. Suppose, for instance,
that the fleet had been ordered to sail home imme
diately after the battle, as some thought it should have
been, and that the Philippines had been left to Spain,
does anybody suppose that Dewey would have had the
place in our national pantheon that he occupies now?
"Or suppose the masses held Atkinson's opinions
about expansion, is it likely that they would have
worked themselves up to a frenzy of enthusiasm over
Dewey? The reception of the admiral's name in
Atkinsonian meetings is sufficient answer to the ques
tion. The manifest truth is that the people who
cheered for Dewey were believers in expansion, as he
b himself. Compare the seven miles of packed and
howling humanity on Saturday with a meeting in a
third-story hall and you will have the measure of the
expansion and anti-expansion sentiment among the
American people."
The Journal then quotes ex-Democratic Governor
Fattison of Pennsylvania in favor of expansion and
s::ys: "He was twice elected Governor of Pennsyl
vania, a State whose Republican majorities are usu
ally counted in six figures. He is experienced in read
ing the signs of popular feeling, and when he says
that in his recent travels in the West he lias seen no
sign of a backward movement anywhere, and asks
v hether the Dewey outpouring in New York indicated
r:iy abatement in national enthusiasm, Democrats will
do well to give thoughtful attention to his- observa
tions." Remember, this was last October. The
Philippine war was on then, as it is now. There is no
change anywhere in the expansion situation which
the Hearst papers regarded with such approval. But
tlie moment their idea of government unlimited by
the constitution is applied to our "outside de
pendencies" they shriek "infamy" and denounce
tlie Porto Rico tariff because it is unconstitutional!
Such opposition is unworthy of consideration. It is
below contempt. Those two papers demand that we
must have these outside dependencies and must gov
ern them outside the constitution and then denounce
our possession of them and our first attempt at such
government!
Suppose the party they represent get into power,
what policy will it enforce? Will it extend the con
stitution to these dependencies and make equal citi
zens of their eighteen millions of people? Or will it
keep the constitution at home and govern them as it
pleases and how?
Or will it drop these outside dependencies, for the
ownership of which it howled? The people are not to
be fooled. They demand of a political opposition
something more than opposition as to grave issues.
They want a plain declaration of policy. Republican
anti-expansionsists prefer their own party and th-;
prospect of controlling it to a right solution to help
ing into power a mob that can only destroy and has
no ability to construct

HUNTINGTON'S INSURANCE SCHEME CONDEMNED.
Nlles Herald.
IN lies xieiiin.l. tl -_ -
One of the most outrageous infringements upon a man's rights is the reiier
department" of the Southern Pacific Company, which has recently been promul
gated. It forces every employe, regardless of his position or desires, to pay a nign
premium to the corporation for sick and death benefits, and to do so whether ne
has other protection or not. Â¦ , _â-_* lv n
One of the very strongest objections is the fact that the station as" 1 *;?â¢"
is as free from liability to accident as an editor, shall pay the same P re "" u â¢_,^
a switchman, who takes his life into his hands every hour of the day. Tfteomy
classification of risks is the salary, each man being bled for a certain per cent oi
Another strong objection is the clause exempting the company from damage
suits or forfeiture of all claims for insurance. .
This is a free country and no corporation should be allowed to cinch its em
ployes as the Southern Pacific Company is making an effort to do. Its hospital
system is now robbing the men of thousands of dollars per year. The men
should be protected by law, as they cannot do anything themselves at the riaK
of losing their positions. . . . .
If pressed, the men will no doubt strike, and then the State will have to again
go through the scenes of IS!M, but every fair-minded man should stand witn.tne
railroad men and give them every assistance in his power in their fight for per
sonal liberty as to how and where they shall take their Insurance.
The press of the State should take up their battle and see to it that the next
Legislature passes laws which will prevent this highway robbery and force all
corporations to give a public statement of the receipts and disbursements every
six months of all funds collected from their employes. 'v* v -

The Insurance scheme of the Southern Pacific does not seem to find much favor
with their employes. The opposition is widespread and the explanations so far
made by Mr. Kruttschnltt and the heads of the different departments have not
been satisfactory to the employes. The majority of the men are Insured In
some mutual insurance organization, in which they receive all the Insurance
they are in need of at a far less cost than C. P. Huntington's scheme. The
burden imposed is too heavy on their Income; besides the other features of thi3
plan will bring a state of unrest that is bound to lead to serious consequences.
The fraternal part of Mr. Huntington does not seem to appeal to his employes
and we can hardly blame them, as there seems- to be some sinister design which
will probably creep out later. If all the railroad organizations on this coast will
stand together and make Mr. Huntington understand that they do not propose to
be coerced, his pet measure will be abandoned.
San Benlto Advance.
The scheme of the Southern Pacific Company to inaugurate an insurance
and relief department among their host of employes has met with the most
serious opposition. While the general scheme of relief is good, there are features
connected therewith which are unfair, and which if not withdrawn will lead to
serious trouble and discontent. Unless the railroad officials who are Introduc
ing the relief scheme can make a better showing than they have up to date,
it will never become popular with the railroad employes. And in their resistance
to what is put forward as philanthropy, they will have the hearty indorsement" of
the intelligent traveling public.
on the sth of November following. The
"outlay for a poor man who wants to go
there from San Francisco and return*
will be about $600, and that does not allow
him to indulge in many things he might
fancy as mementoes or to visit other
places of interest in the great city.

Small Voice in the jfeÂ«,-LOOX,HERE, UNCLE, WE'VE GOT A WAR OF OUROWN-
THE CLIMAX OF FAKE FIGHTING
HAD. any further evidence been required to con
vince the public that the so-called sport of prize
fighting has in this' city become nothing more
than a fake scheme for fleecing those who are foolish
enough to bet on the contests, it would have been fur
nished by the match between Stelzner and Butler un
der the management of the National Athletic Club at
Woodward's Pavilion on. Wednesday evening. The
thing was so clearly a prearranged scheme to defraud
bettors that the referee refused to stand for it, and
even the club managers became ashamed. The ref
eree declared all bets off as soon as the men entered
the ring, and the managers told them after the fight
that it was so palpably a fake they would receive noth
ing for their exhibition.
While that is perhaps the "rawest" game of the
kind ever put up in San Francisco, it does not stand
alone. Again and again the deluded patrons of the ring
and of pugilism have been treated to similar exhibitions
and have lost their money by betting upon matches
which were fixed beforehand. They were in fact on
Wednesday evening more fortunate than usual, for
by the action of the referee they were saved from the
loss of money bet upon the match and are victims only
to the extent of the amounts paid out to enter the
pavilion and see the fake.
Such a fraud, coming on top of the many that pre
ceded it, caps the climax and completes the exposure
of the whole rotten system of public prize-fighting.
It makes clear the need of the enactment of just such
an ordinance as that submitted to the Supervisors by
the irate Mr. Tobin on Monday. In fact it seems the
promoters of the fake had come to the conclusion the
Tobin ordinance will be adopted and hastily arranged
the Stelzner and Butler programme to make a clean
up before it goes into effect.
Having had this much of an exposition of the tricks
of the trade it is to be hoped the betting public will be
sufficiently intelligent to profit by it and let that form
of gambling alone. 1 The" pugs should.be forced to go
East or go to work. There should be no further tol
eration for them in San Francisco any more than for
the Eastern contingent of track, gamblers who have
been trying to; obtain the 'privilege of operating at
Ingleside. Enough is as good as ; a feast at all times
and in this : particular business there has now been
spread forth enough rottenness to satisfy buzzards.

hours of its allotted time for duty the household will
close up like a California poppy at sunset and not open
its radiant life again until the next sunrise.
â¢There is much in the project to be commended.
Every class of workers is entitled to some respite from
work, to some time of leisure which they can call their
own. One of the chief reasons why American girls
dislike domestic service is the continuous .round of
work it imposes.- When' the factory closes for the
day the factory girl's work for that day is done and
thereafter until next morning she is her own mistress.
That degree of liberty" is 'highly prized. and if, it can
be provided for employes in domestic service there can
be no question but what it will go Â¦' far; toward making
that form of work more attractive than it is.
Whether or not the improvement can be effected on
a basis sufficiently economical to render it. practicable
remains to be seen. Mrs. Eramons Blame will prob
ably find that she needs three sets of servants instead
of two to carry out the work of her household on the
eight-hour plan. She is rich and can afford it. Her
neighbors who are not rich will watch her experi
ment with an attention due to something more than
feminine curiosity. They will wish to see how they
can adopt the system without diminishing their mil
liners' bills or ruining their husbands.

VIâ EXPOSING THE PLATE.
When we are ready to withdraw t!ic
slide so as to expose the plate, that is. to
allow the picture as we have just seen It
upon the ground glass to be thrown ;n the
same way upon the face of the dry plate
in our holder and the image of the picture?
to be impregnated upon the plate. w. e
must again caution against overexposure.
We shall learn later on of exposure
meters for mechanically judging of ex
posure. At present we shall endeavor to
get as correct an exposure as possible by
our own judgment, which after all s the
best exposure meter. This judging of cor
rect exposure is a part of photograoliy
which should receive constant study. Ex
pert knowledge Is secured only through
close observation and long experience.
Suppose that we have a medium plate
in the holder and that our view Is made
up of a clump of trees, a brook, a few
large stones and an old log bridge. It is
a fairly bright day and the sun is shlntiiy.
After studying the time of exposure by
looking first at the view and then at IUJ
image on the ground glass, as already de
scribed, we conclude that with the stop or
diaphragm that we have used to get our
picture at its best five seconds is
about the correct time. Our lens being
closed, either by placing the cap. on th<
projecting hood of the lens or by .closing
the shutter, we take. hold of the slide wltl.
the fingers of the right hand, placing th.
left upon the top of the camera over tro
slideholder in order to steady the camera,
and draw out the slide completely. V-c
must be very careful to draw it over per
fectly straight, for the reason that the end
of the holder through which the slHe is
drawn is protected by a spring or cushion
of black velvet extending the width or the
sliue. If we draw out the slide with a
downward motion the upper end leaves
the holder first, while the lower end. still
In the slide, holds the cushion from pei
forming its function, which is to close up
the slot when the elide is out and thus
prevent the rays of light from pas. rg
through to the plate, which means tlia..
our plate will be fogged, or light struck.
"It ls'then of great importance that we
draw our slide out gently., yet auickh.
and draw it straight. After drawing the
slide it is well to acquire the habit of
throwing the side of tte focuslnff ciotn
over the side of the camera from % h eh
the slide has been withdrawn, thus doully
Detecting the end of our holder from tna
Fff Especially should this be done in
outdoor work. , f ...
Now. to count our seconds and to count
them as seconds: it is remarkaMe hovk
differently as to time this may be "onf.
of course w e may use a watch and get the
time exact but it is claimed, and with
trath. by good camerists that to expose
mechanically is to IoÂ»Â» the soul of the
nirtnre for when once one Is ma3ter
of timing a picture under different phases
tnere 3 an nner feeling of conception of
the depth of the picture that guides the
hand and eye in making exposures. Be
this as it may. it is true that nine people
out of ten expose by rule of eye or count.
V havlfound that by a very little prac
tice almost correct time may be gUen in
seconds by countingâ one secondâ two sec
onds-three seconds distinctly and in the
usual speed of the voice in talking. Â¦To
try to count by saying one. two. three,
will rarely land the beginner within half
Of the time he expects. Begin counting
as the shutter, is opened or the lens un
capped and close the lens at the end of
the last "second." Don't be tempted to
give "just a little more time.' for more
plates are spoiled by the "little more time"
than by almost any other means '
The exposure being made the slide is re
placed, and here we must remember to
place the end of the slide exactly straight
in the opening, and keep it straight, for to
introduce one corner first would ruin our
nlate Just as we have seen above. In re
placing the slide be sure to have the dark
side of the slide on the outside, as this
will show that the plate has been exposed
and will keep us from making the quite
common mistake of exposing the same
P Right here and now is the time for us to
begin a system of "method," by which we
mean' labeling each exposure and Jotting
down a quick memorandum of the view
taken, the plate used, the stop used and
the time or exposure: also whether the
day is dull, medium or light. This tabu
lating will mean the saving of a great
many plates and a deal of wear and tear
on our temper when we come to develop
our pictures, not only on this initiative
; trip but in all our future work. There
is nothing so exasperating as to return
home from a photographing jaunt with
a half dozen choice views, taken and timed
under a half dozen different conditions of
light and speed, only to forget in the dark
room "which are which." Let us decide
now that we shall always carry a mem
orandum book on our trip and jot down
particulars somewhat as follows:
PLATE NO. 1.
View, landscape, dark foliage; brook, log
brldze In foresround.
Lensâ Goers, 4x3. * n
Plate â Cramer, "Banner.
Timeâ Five seconds.
Llirlitâ Bright. 2 p. m.
Result.....
And so on with each exposure. Of course
each plate-holder must .be numbered so
that No. 1 plate corresponds with No. 1
"memo." By keeping a careful record of
each exposure in this manner we soon
learn by comparison and by early mis
takes the proper exposure to give under
any given .circumstances.
We have cautioned against overexpos
ure for the reason that the almost uni
versal failing of the beginner Is to over
expose, but a little overexposure Is more
easily handled In development than is un
derexposure, for we can sometimes get a
good negative from an overexposed plate

Pacific Coast Merchants Endeavor to
Block the Scheme of Canadian
Shipowners at Washington.
For the past few weeks the Chamber of
Commerce and the Pacific Coast repre
sentatives at Washington have been at
work to prevent the authorities at the na
tional capital acceding to the wishes of
British Columbia shippers to have Nome
City a sub-port of entry. It was learned
here that shipowners whose vessels are
flying, the flag of her Majesty have been
advertising, to carry freight and pas&en
gers direct to Nome as soon as the weath
er would permit. No time was lost in urn-
Ing Western Representatives to block the
game, so as to give the owners of Amer
ican coasting vessels the business, which
rightfully belongs to them, vlf Nome is
not made a sub-port of entry British ship,
pers will have to land at Dutch Harbor
or St. Michael iind, send their passengers
and cargoes to the new gold flleds by
American vessels. Senator Perkins and
others have presented the Â¦ matter to the
Treasury Department. - receiving the as
surance that Nome "would be held for
American shippers only. - :
Recently, the Republican Represcnta
tives learned that the Canadian shippers
were working to influence the' Treasury
Department to reconsider, the. mattfr, so
as to allow their ships the same opportu
nities as those owned in the United States.
The claim of the Canadian shippers Is that
there are not enough American vessels to
handle the freight.
Captain Nelson of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday sent the following dis
patch to Secretary of the Treasury GaÂ»e:
r 'Our merchants and shipowners urgently
request you not to make Nome City a sub
port of entry. They are abundantly tble
to furnish transportation' and supplied for

Where a large portion of the subject is
under trees, as in the case of forest glades
or wooded ravines, very long exposures
may be required, because the greater port
of the light has been filtered through the
green leaves overhead, and this holds
good even though the camera itself Is not
under the trees. The color of the objects
also influences the time of exposure; a
yellow. stone building requires longer ex
posure than one of white stone, and a
red brick building will require still longer.
Interiors of buildings always require
longer exposures than ordinary outdoor
subjects, but they show such great differ
ences, according to the size and posi
tion of the windows and the color of the
glass, that the time required varies from
less than a minute to three or four hours,
or even more. Subjects including a large
Â¦proportion of sea and sky require, as a
rule, very short exposures. The time of
exposure In the case of portraits varies
very much, and depends on the conditions
of lighting and also on the character of
the effect desired.
The light is most active and the ex
posures required an vnortesfl tn June, and
on a bright day the activity of the light
remains practically the same between 9
a. m. and 3 p. m., and It is equally active
in May and July from ID a. m. to 2 p. m.
In spring and autumn longer exposures
are required, and In winter the time must
be from three to ten times as long as in
June, according to the hour of the day.
The light is least active in December, and
the exposure required becomes shorter
and shorter as we approach June, and
afterward becomes longer and longer until
the maximum is again reached in Decem
ber. The light increases In brightness
from early morning until midday, when
it attains a maximum, and then falls off
again until sunset, the falling off being
considerably more rapid in winter than
In summer. In very early morning and
toward sunset the exposures are always
long, especially if the light la at all yel
low.
When the sun is shining and there are
white clouds in the sky opposite the sun
the exposures needed are shorter. ot"her
things being equal, than when the sky is
perfectly cloudless. A cloud actually In
front of the sun of course lengthens the
necessary exposure very considerably, and
the same Is true in a smaller degree of
light cloudy that do 'not completely ob
scure the sun. Rain clears the atmos
phere of dust, etc., and, other things be
ing equal, less exposure is required after
a shower.
It will be clear that the estimation of
correct exposure requires Judgment and
experience. The conditions are never con
stant and hence numerical tables are only
very approximate, although they afford
some assistance at the beginning. Not
much help can be obtained from actlno
meters because they only measure the
intensity of the light where the photo
graphor is standing, while what we ought
to measure is the Intensity of the light
reflected from the different parta of the
subject. Now and again, and especially
when dealing with interiors, they will tell
us that the light is much yellower and
less active than we should otherwise have
believed.
The photographer must, learn to rely
upon his own judgment, guided by the
nature of the subject, with a special re
gard to the proportion and depth of the
shadows; the apparent brightness of the
image on the ground glass, the time of
year, the time of day and the character
of the light, especially with regard to the
presence of clouds â even light ones â be
tween the sun and earth. Brightness to
the eye is not necessarily a measure of
activity on the photographic plate, and.
aa already pointed out, any yellowness â
even though slightâ ln the light length
ens considerably the time of exposure re
quired. Sufficient exposure should always
be given for the dark parts of the sub
ject; the brightly Illuminated parts will
take care of themselves. The exposure
given will also depend on the ' character
of the results required: very short expo
sures increase the contrast and long ex
posures reduce the contrast. If, there
fore, you consider that the contrast of
light and shade in the subject is too
strong for pictorial effect, give a longer
exposure, and vice versa. For example, a
view including whitewashed cottages or
other brilliantly lighted objects, together
with foliage, will require a comparatively
long exposure if harsh contrasts in tbe
negative are to be avoided.

COURSE IN AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY.
Cdpyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, Â» FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1900.
Rival Bivalve Diggers Engage in a Quarrel Which Is Settled in Court.
RUBBER- NECK clams, properly prepared, are
morsels of food that gourmands are said to rave
over. Michael Connell and James Connell, brother
clam-digKers, are not gourmands. In fact, if asked
what gourmands were, they would probably shake
their heads and say that they did not inhabit the mud
flats that surround the bay shore at the foot of Thirty
sixth street. The Connells are conversant with big neck
and little neck clams and the' best time and place to
gather them. They are also experts on landing "rubber
neck" clams. The oldest descendant of the Connell tribe
has beenengagedin this lucrative pastime for such a long
period that when a festive clam stretches its neck out of
the mud to gaze at its surroundings Michael snips him be
fore the bivalve can escape.
The fame of the. Connells as clam-dlggers is not confined
to the district In which they reside. When both appeared
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday to answer to charges of
battery against Fred de Crolx, a rival clam-gatherer, the
bailiff of the court whispered to the Judge that they were
"Its," with capital Is.
Judge Cabaniss did not lose his presence of mind, but
greeted the illustrious clam-diggers with proper feeling.
He invited the defendants and their relentless prosecutors
to chairs and then began an investigation that will go down
In Police Court annals as the "clammiest" Investigation
ever held. Mr. de Crblx, who parts his name In the middle,
told a sad story, of prosecution and suffering. He has a
"clam bed" which adjoins that of the Connells. The clams
on his side of the line have imbibed the bitter feeling, that
exists between the rivals' arid they do not visit each other.
The dividing line between the clam beds shifts with, each
changing tide and this results in warm arguments and
oftentimes blows. Â¦
A few days ago De Crolx crossed the dividing line to
remonstrate with 'the- Connells. He was treated unnelgh
borlyâin fact, he was thrown Into the ooze that lies at the
foot of the Connell mansion, and as he sank he heard Pat
Malacky and the Connells Veil derisively at his plight.
When . he succeeded' in reaching dry land and had shaken
the clams out of his boots he hied himself to the Police
Court and swore to complaints against both men and Pat
Malacky for giving him a mud bath and the "ha ha."
Judge Cabannls fourd the Connells guilty as charged and
will sentence them to-d?.y: The Connells will to-day prob
ably swear out a warrant for De Crolx's arrest for stealing
their clams.
SPRING EXCURSION
IS OFF THIS YEAR
The promoters of the Manufacturers'
and Wholesalers' League of San Francisco
have decided to abandon the spring ex
cursion this yeaf. Excursions were 'ar
ranged to bring purchasers from all parts
of the continent west of the Mississippi.
The inducement was that the outside
merchants would be allowed a rebate of
one-half their iailroad fare provided they
bought their stock from members of the
league.
Large numbers took advantage of the
offer, but the league found that the out
siders made purchases only in certnin
lines, and that while the wholesalers and
manufacturers of these articles did tvell
the other subscribing members of the
league sold but little and had to stand
thPlr proportion of tho fxivn>p.

NEW YORK. March 15.â The principal ln
tenct in to-day's stock market centered In
Fugar. Third Avenue and Burlington. The rest
ol the market gave evidence of come disap
pointment over the noneffect of the currency
tnd refunding law. Prices were sustained for
a time by the strength of the three stocks
mentioned and some others lejÂ« prominent.
I-urlir.irton was most consistently strong and
Kave evidence of manipulation, said to be by
c. pool formed to advance the stock. Its ex
trÂ»-n.e rise was 1%. It had the most effect on
the other grangers, but served as a tonic on
the whole of the railroad list. The iron and
rteei siooks at- a group were Inclined to flrm
r-uss on the confidence expressed by trade pub
lkatlons in the maintenance of prices. Third
Avenue was leveribh and active all day. Its
strength was attributed by many to operations
_Â«ainrt a large outstanding short interest,
tnd the stock advanced at one time above 70.
compared with i 9 on a drive at the opening.
The violent fluctuations in the price reflected
the doubtful and conflicting opinions of specu
lators in tho Block. It closed with a net gain
of 2V Sugar was not so erratic and did not
BUM over 60 wide a range, but its extreme
rise uf 3% after tin opening decline gave way
to reaction In the late dealings and it closed
practically uncha.nged. There was a declded
Inollnation to throw over storks by the tired
bolder* in the late transactions and the closing
vas quite acti\e end weak, the early gains
except In a few cas?s being wiped out. Read-
Ing first preferred fell sharply nearly 2 points
on the r-i>'>rts by trad>? authorities of softness
in the anthracite market. People's Gas wan
also eunfjii<-uous in the late break. The gen
Â«tÂ»!.l expectation of a poor bank statement was
the underlying motive of the selling. The
rate for cail loans was rather easier than yes
terday under the influence of the dividend dis
bursements. The prevailing rate was 5 per cent
and Joans were made at 4 per cent. New York
exchange at Chicago hardened sharply to 10
cent* discount compared with 25 cents yoster
day and there was a similar movement at other
jH'ints. liut the sub-treasury made another
la:pe dralt on the cash reeoorcÂ«_i of the banks
bringing its total withdrawals for thÂ« week
thus far up to $4.723.00n. As the xurplus last
Saturday was tjelow $6.000. 0C>0 and the cur
rency movement is generally believe, to have
bf-en In favor of the interior since then, while
the loans of the banks have evidently been
further expended. It Is difficult to believe that
anything ran be saved in the way of a sur
plus far the basics this week. The report of
a dcScit is bound to have an unfavorable
sentimental effect on prices, however soon re
lief may b_ forthcoming from Increase, bank
circulation or disbursement of Government
bond premiums. London sold stocks in this
market, apparently on account of the condi
tion of the money market there, which is called
stringent, and which the statement of the
I tank of England thowK no prospÂ«n_s of lm

CHICAGO, March 15.-The early trading in
wheat was not marked by any degree of ac
tivity or any marked tone. The opening for
May was at 66H@66%c. a decline of . VÂ»Â®%c
from yesterday, the slight loss being" due In
part to disappointment over the reluctant're
sponse of the Liverpool market to yesterday's
advance here. The loss was recovered almost
Immediately. May advancing to 66 T /Â»c under
covering by local shorts, but before 11 o'clock
weakness again developed and kept prices on
the down grade for nearly an hour. During this
part of the session the foreign demand for
American wheat was reported poor, while ex
pectations of heavy Argentine wheat shipments
to-morrow, a feature which has knocked good
fractions off of the price of wheat for three
successive Fridays, resulted In considerable
short selling, the theory being that to-mor
row's opening would show a decline. About
noon, however, the market turned quite strong
on rumors of crop damage and the price which
had In the meantime fallen off to 66 t 4<g6ii'HsC.
advanced to 67c. But this was thÂ» price that
heavy holders had apparently been waiting for
and offerings became so heavy that VÂ«c was
knocked off May figures In a hurry. At 6C?ic
a good demand existed and the market held
eteady at around that figure for some time,
re|>orts of a good demand for export at out
side shipping points having considerable In
fluence. Shortly before the close realizing
sales and uneasiness over the weakness shown
by corn caused another decline and the tone
during the last few minutes was one of weak
ness. May eased off ito 66% c and closed at
6â¬%c.
Corn was only moderately active. Early In
the session there were Indications ' that in
fluential holders were disposing of their May
and buying July, and this resulted in con
siderable liquidation. Heavy clearances had a
steadying Influence later, sellers turning buy
ers, but toward the close the market again
developed a tendency to decline and the 'close
was rather easy. May closed H- lower at
Trading In oats was almost without feature
and was on a small scale all day. May closed
at 23% c.
Provisions were moderately active and rather
Irregular within a small range. Packers were
fair sellers, but pit traders showed a dispo
sition to cover shorts, which, with some com
mission house buying, kept the market fairly
steady most of the session. May pork closed
5c lower. May lard a shade lower and May
ribs unchanged.

BROWNIES IN
FAIRYLAND
"The Brownies in Fairyland" made their
bow to a crowded house at the California
Theater yesterday afternoon and con
vinced the audience that the town is chock
full of precocious youngsters, and that
every one of them is either a "brownie"
or a "fairy." â¢
There is nothing small about the Brown
ies, excepting, of course, the performers.
Everything else Is Immense. The scenery
and costuming are elaborate, and the
vocal gems and dainty dances with which
the meager story is plentifully stuffed Is
such as would do honor to a production
of talented professionals.
Â¦ To single out any of the performers for
special mention would be not only unfair,
but Impossible. There were no "better"
actors; all were "best." Tiny tots who
seemed to be taking yesterday for the first
time steps without the kindly aid of a.
chair broke into the swaying motion of
the Cakewalk.
The "fairies," for once In the history of
the stage, were joung, and the "brownies"
happy and brave, with just the right sort
of ppindle-shanked legs. Last evening
again the "fairies" disported themselves
in sylvan groves and the "brownies" van
quished their formidable foe. The same
performance will, go on again this after

SUMMING UP OF
HOLMES' CONCERTS
THE symphony season Is at an end.
The final concert of the series took
place yesterday afternoon at the
Grand Opera-house, and Mr. Henry
Holmes laid down his baton with
out, it must be said, having wielded it in
any case with the magic of the master.
I know nothing of the internecine war
fare that raged in the camp of our sym
phony, cult at the beginning of the present
season, and from which Mr. Holmos
sprang as a full-fledged and accredited
leader of symphony, in my ignorance of
the causes that gave rise to undignified
display of petty jealousies and recrimina
tion I am ready Â¦to suspect that Mr.
Holmes was forced into a usurpation of
the post of conductor by some over-zeal
ous and undiscrimlnating hero-worshipers
and equally ready to doubt that he him
self sought a position he was so little cap
able of rilling.
In offering an estimate of the work per
formed during the season I have avoided
comparison as a measure of merit, yet the
standard by which we judge must be in
the' mind it it bo not pronounced.
The contrasting of Mr. Holmes and Mr.
Scheel has been, of bourse, inevitable and
there can be but one conclusion drawn.
\Ve have had one musician, who, as a
leader of orchestra, was dowered with a
superb mastership, beside which the in
aptitude of his successor is almost pitiful,
ilr. Fritz Scheel was that man. He was
not granted the pecuniary support that
has stood in good stead of the present
season and he did not have at his dis
posal the admirable array of instrumen
talists that has worked with Mr. Holmes,
but by sheer force of his enormous genius
(a strong term, I admit, but a just one)
he gave a value to whatever he touched
well nigh unsurpassable.
A review of the season would be but a
catalogue of Inefficient interpretations.
Tschaikowsky. Schubert, Schumann, Bee
thoven and Mendelssohn have been suc
cessively butchered, and all of merit that
there has been in the concerts is due to
Mr. Marquart, a not too talented musi
cian, and the worthy workers of the rank
and ille. I believe Mr. Holmes to have
attainments of no ordinary character; he
is equipped with a superior technical
knowledge, but the essential attributes of
the maestro are not his.
Against the formalism and perverted
authority from which he is Inseparable,
there is a want of spirit, passion, tem
perament that renders his grasp of the
bigger things in music so variously inef
fective. He is wanting also in rhythm
sense and the judicious direction of tempo
and he. has at times conducted numbers
with which he was evidently Ignorant of
the construction, much less the purpose
and possibilities.
Yesterday's concert began with Schu
mann's "Manfred," which was very well
executed by the band, particularly in the
finale. The symphony was Mendelssohn's
"Scotch," wherein the orchestra again ac
quitted itself commendably. The ada
gio, thanks to Mr. Holmes, was -posi
tively racy and in the last movement, al
legro guerriero, the secure workmanship
of the muijlrlans hardly availed against
the utter kosence of vitality and spirit
essential to Its proper rendering.
Not only did Mr. Holmes fail to give
force and color to the movement, but he
conducted it with a more than usual
looseness. He indicated his accents In the
most haphazard fashion and frequently
lost the pace and place altogether. The
Tschaikowsky "Scherzo," which is quite
beyond his ken, was Interesting In itself
and the band played It acceptably if with
out sensational effect. The "William
Tell" overture followed, and thus ended
the inglorious symphony season of 1900.

THIRTEEN GRAVES STOP
RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION
Unprecedented Obstacle Encountered
on the Northern Pacific Ex
tension.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
BOISE/ Idaho, March 15.â The railroad
construction forces have, encountered an
unprecedented obstacle on the Northern
Pacific extension from Stuart to the
mouth of Cottonwood Creek. Directly In
the lino of location, from which there can
be no deviation owing to the canyon
walls, are thirteen graves in ' a row.
graves of Indian children whose fathers
and mothers live in the Kamalh Valley.
Just the width of thirteen graves is the
land needed by the railroad. The prog
ress of the railroad ia not delayed by
force qf arms, but by the awe Inspired
by the universal sentiment of grief for
the dead.
The engineers prepared to remove the
dead from their resting places. The boxes
wore brought and unloaded at the graves.
Then came a pathetic scene that stopped
every spade. From the hearts of mothers
burst forth nature's language of grief. It
was an appeal that no man from official
to shoveler could resist. The boxes that
wpre brought to hold the dead lie there
deserted as though a curse had fallen on
the spot.
Cyrus Beede, the Government .commis
sioner, who has settled so many disputes
with the Indians, is appealed to. He has
a new sentiment to combat. No price
will influence these disconsolate mothers.
No court will condemn a right of way
through a city of the dead. The Indians
and the whites, however, have faith In
Beede, but he says this Is the most deli
cate commission ever imposed on him. ln
his thirty years in the Indian service.
WIDOW BOBBED.
House of Mrs. Longmire at Willows
Entered and Money Taken.
Special Dispatch to The Call
WILLOWS, March 13.â Some person as
yet unknown stealthily entered the home
of Mrs. Emma Longmire, a widow, early
this morning and robbed her of $370. The;
burglar entered the building by cutting a
hole through a screen on the window and
crawling over the foot of the bed in
which Mrs-. Longmlra was lying. Having
gained access to the room the thief en
tered a closet, which was within two feet
of the head of the bed, took a small toy
bank from the shelf within, stepped back
Into the bedroom and proceeded to coolly
remove the contents of the bank, which
amounted to $390.
He would have escaped without notice
had he not dropped a $20 gold piece on
the floor. The noise of the dropping coin
aroused Mrs. Longmire and she uttered a
cry frightening the robber, who beat a
hasty retreat through a back door, tak
ing the remainder of the money, $370.
The officers were quickly notified of the
theft and are now working on the case.
They have been , unable to obtain a clue
but are determined to thoroughly investi
gate the affair.
Mrs. Lonemire has been sick for the
past two months, and is yet quite nervous,
consequently she cannot give an intelli
gent description of the burglar. She is
not in very good circumstances and the
loss falls heavily upon her. It is thought
whoever committed the crime was well
acquainted with the house and the place
where the money was kept. ' :Â¦;

WALSH MUST SUPPORT
HIS TWO CHILDREN
Judge Dunne Refuses to Commit
Youngsters Charged With
Crime to Whittier.
InEtead of being sent to prison to pass
their minority among incorrigibles and
criminals, Edward and Willie Walsh,
youngsters of 14 and 16 years respectively,
will. In all probability, be handed back to
the care of their father and he will leave
the court with them after receiving due
instruction as to the manner in which
he should care for and educate his chil
dren. The youngsters were up before
Judge Dunne yesterday on charges of rob
bery. The Information against them was
signed by Nora Coughlin, their grand
mother, and she charged that In the early
part of January last they robbed her of
$13. After reading the information Judge
Dunne requested the lad's father to step
to the bar.
â¢'How long nave these boys been in
Jail?" asked the court, addressing Walsh.
"About two months," answered the
father.
"Such a condition of affairs Is without
precedent," continued the court, "and
such an experience is enough to ruin them
for life."
Walsh admitted that he was aware of
the evils Â©af prison life, but crept behind
the excuse that he could not prevent the
lower court from holding them for trial.
As it was paid that the children were
held at the father's request, who hoped
to send them to Whittlcr Reform School,
Judge Dunne continued the case for a
week. In the meantime, he said, he would
investigate the matter, and at the end of
the week would probably find that - the
children should be supported and educated
by their father, and not be made a bur
den to the State or thrown into prison
to associate with hardened criminals dur
ing their minority.
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF
TELEPHONES FAVORED
Supervisors' Public Utilities Commit
tee Considers Projects to Be
Submitted to the People.
The Supervisors' Committee on Public
Utilities met last night in the chambers
of the board for the purpose of getting in
formation and suggestions regarding the
acquisition of public utilities by the mu
nicipality. The investigation was directed
toward deciding on tho selection of the
first utility to be acquired by the city.
Chairman Reed conducted the questioning
of several experts who were present and
in this way elicited much valuable infor
mation. The report of the Board of Pub
lic Works on the subject, submitted sev
eral weeks ago, was read, after which an
invitation was extended to those present
to give their views on the matter.
City Engineer Grunsky Informed the
committee that the investigation into the
estimate of the cost of supplying munici
pal water twenty years ago did not go
into the details contemplated In the pres
ent inquiry, but contained much valuable
Information. The contemplated plans in
cluded supplies from Clear Lake, Feather
liiver. American River. Lake Tahoe, Blue
Lakes and San Joaquin River.
Commissioner Hanson of the Board of
Works, was of the opinion that any source
of water supply for municipal acquisition
should be capable of supplying at least
Â£.0.000.000 gallons of water. The ultimate
right of acquiring two sources of water
supply should also be considered. Any un
derground supply Is liable In time to be
exhausted. Mr. Manson did not believe
that the proposition of municipal owner
ship could be submitted to the people by
a year from next July. He said he thought
that some of the other utilities could be
taken up first with better and quicker
results. If the Board of Supervisors would
issue a call for a telephone service the
plan could be carried out much more
quickly than the water supply system. An
electric light plant could also be acquired
in much less time than the water project.
Mayor Phelan thought the water supply
was desirable to take up first, because the
sources are being rapidly absorbed and
every year they are becoming more vaju
able and harder to acquire. He thought
that the idea of furnishing cheaper water
to consumers was very important.
Reed said that the municipal ownership
of telephones was especially, desirable.
The local corporation was In receipt of a
larger income on a smaller investment
than any other concern. He deprecated
the fact that the telephone companies had
been omitted in the charter relative to
the supervision and fixing of rates by the
city.

points and says that stampeders to Nome
would stand a. much better chance of get
ting through if equipped with wheels. His
glowing reports caused people starting for
Nome to buy up all the available bicycle*.

cyclists starting down the river.
F. H. Nagle and Robert McÃae are the

CONTRA COSTA
GETS ALAMEDA'S
WATER SUPPLY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 15.
The Artesian Water Company of Ala
meda was finally absorbed to-day by tho
Contra Costa Water Company of this city,
and the deeds and mortgages involving
the transfer were filed. The figures are
not named In the documents, but the rev
enue stamps thereon indicate a valuation
of 5750,000.
There were three documents necessary
to make the transfer perfect. While there
was a corporation under the name of the
Artesian Water Company, it was hardly
more than the personal holding of Captain
R. R. Thompson. Captain Thompson had
never transferred to the water company
much of the property which the company
operated, and in order to make the trans
fer perfect it was found necessary to oeed
a large amount of property from Captain
Thompson to the Artesian Water Com
pany. The water company in turn deeded
all of the property which it held .Â»nd
which it received from Captain Thompson
to the Contra Costa Water Company.
The property transferred consists of
three tracts of artesian well land at Fitch
burg, aggregating 350 acres, on which
thftre are ninety-seven wells, half a dozen
pumps, reservoirs, pipe and engines. I.i
Alameda there is the old pumping plant
and wel'.s on High street, the lot and
building and reservoir on Park street and
a large lot on Santa Clara avrnue. 330,400
feet of pipe. 3037 meters. 247 hydrants and
the franchises, rights and privileges that
have been granted by the town and
county.
There was filed a mortgage to the Union
Trust Company for JGOO.OOO in the f>hap<; of
600 bonds of $1000 each, covering the prop
erty of the company.
This means that the Contra Costa Water
Company has finally absorbed the Ala
meda city water supply. The deal vUt'i
the Alameda Water Company of Berkeley
Is still on. but negotiations have not yet
been finally closed. When this is com
pleted the Contra Costa Water Company
will control every water right and water
company from San Loandro on the south
to the county line on the north.

THE FAMINE IN INDIA.
9
BERKELEY, March 15.â The Berke
ley "co-ed" has decided to promote
the success of "university week"
at the Grand Opera-house In San
Francisco, and she will lend her tal
ents, work and support to the events
to be then and there given. For the
first time, the Berkeley "co-ed" "*lll
take part in a public . performance â¢on
the stage, but It will only be done be
cause It will be for the interests of the
university.
When "university week" was decided
upon and a production of R. W. Tuily's
famous junior farce selected as one of
the events there was a decided ques
tion as to whether the young ladies of
the cast would take part in the public
production. It was one thing to walk
the boards for a single afternoon be
fore an audience of their college mates,
and quite another to appear before a
general audience and have their name*
appear upon bill boards and In adver
tisements.
But the production of the play de
manded the participation of the young
ladles and the success of "university
week" required the production of the
play. The possibilities of getting the
track team East made "university
week" necessary, so when this list of
demands was presented to the young
ladies they decided that they would, in
the interests of the university, make
Just this appearance before the mis
cellaneous public. But chaperon 3
were demanded on the stage, and this
has been agreed to. It may make the
stage audience large, but the demand
had to be met, and Stage Manager
Tully consented.
The farce was pronounced . by tho
university critics as the best that had
ever been prepared In that lnstituion.
It has been slightly modified In order to
make it' more pleasing to the general
public, and it will be presented by the
following cast:

ONE FAVORITE
OF SEVEN WON
AT TANFORAN
Defeat of Constellator by So
cialist, the Surprise of
the Day.
Handicap Easy for The Fretter â Afa
mada Led Out by Flamoraâ M.
T. Tarpey Outgamed Com
bermere in First Event.
?
Six . stanchly backed favorites wert
brushed off the earth at Tanforan yester
day as easily as a Chinese Bervant would
dust flies off the celling with an imported
bunch of feathers. Most of them received
the right sort of backing, and it could not
be said their downfall was due to any
unhealthy foreign influence.
No doubt the spiciest thing of the a'ter
noon was the defeat of the plunged on 9
to 20 choice Constellator. Tne colt hap
pened to be one of three starters in the
mile purse run. Piggott on Socialist went
out and took hold of him from the jump,
until when the stretch was reached the
three-year-old was dead. Socialist then
galloped in first, and what lamentations
his victory did cause in certain quarters.
Corrigan's two-year-old M. F. "Tarpey
outgamed Combermere in the opening
scramble. The latter ruled a pronounced
favorite, and after leading to the paddock
began to "squawk," losing out by a head.
Piggott furnished a perfect ride on the
winner. Lucidla ran a close third.
W. R. Larzalere's sprinter Afamada
dosed a slight favorite over Flamora for
the six-furlong selling number and met
defeat. Thorpe, who straddled the first
choice, got his mount away in the lead,
showing first until a sixteenth from the
stand. Here Jack Martin on, Flamora
drew up on equal terms and in a driving
finish earned the verdict by a head in 1:14.
Show honors fell to Olinthus.
The mile handicap was only a romp for
The Fretter. The track just suited the
Brutus colt, and he won hands down from
the Bto B favorite Ventoro. Erwin, aske.i
to concede too much weight, ran a com
fortable third.
Considering his recent form 8 to 5 looked
a most liberal quotation against Topmast
In the betting on the mile and a six
teenth affair. During the early running
Piggott took the Shields entry bock, but
when ready won as he liked from Sar
donic. Tappan led Wyoming out for the
show.
Afghan, from the Corrlgan string, re
ceived such strong backing at short odds
to win the fifth event that it looked all
over. The chestnut ran in the lead to 'the
stretch, where he blew up. Flamero, Â»n
8 to 1 shot, then downed Perseus a scÂ«nt
head.
In the last, a seven-furlong jaunt, Sister
Alice, at odds of 9 to 2, was never headed.
Gold Baron came from the rear, beating
Rosalbra for the place.
Track Notes.
Owing 1 to a typographical error the win
ning selections given by The Call yester
day were credited to the Chronicle in the
columns of the Daily Racing News.
It seems very strange that Daisy F
should have been entered in the Constel
lator race at all. The conditions werÂ»
certainly plain enough to show she was
not eligible. The only ones to be fooled
by such a mistake would be the. Eastern
poolrooms, which have no copy of the con
ditions of races.

The Mail steamer City of Peking sailed
for the Orient yesterday. She carried a
fair number of passengers and was loaded
to the guards with freight. Quite a num
ber of fair maidens from the Grand
Opera-house were down to see the big
liner sail. Among them was Miss Edna
Farrell, whom rumor says Is going to
marry Chief Officer R. : Bucknam : of the
Mail boat. Everybody knows of Miss Far
rell. and Captain Bucknam Is equally well
known among shipping men. He was for
merly master of the whalebock City of
Everett, but left that vessel to enter the
Mail Company's service. He was captain
of tho port at Panama for a year, and on
coming home on account of ill health was
appointed to the Peking.
Among the passenger* who went away
on the Peking was E. Vonck, the owner
and manager of the largest sugar planta
tion in Java. He has been all over the
world inspecting refineries and picking up
Information. As the result of his travels
he says the finest sugar manufacturing
plant in the world is at Watsonville. Cap
tain Merry, who goes to Honolulu to take
charge of the naval station at that port,
was another passenger, and Miss Me-
Clure, daughter of the chief engineer of
the Peking, will make the round Â¦ trip oa
the steamer. Â¦ :.
A blglleet of vessels is being got ready
for the Nome trade. The well found bark
Alaska is r being fitted out at Harrison
street wharf; the barkentino Catherine
Sudden at Mission-street wharf; the
steam schooner Alliance Is having a deck
house built on her at the Folsom-street
bulkhead; the schooner Volante is -ready
for freight, while the steam whalers
Thrasher, Jeanette and Mary D. Hume
are ready for an Immediate start, for the
gold fields. These three vessels will prob
ably be the first to reach Nome, and fol
lowing them very close; will be the bark
Alaska. The whalers are only carrying
a favored few, and the Alaska has nearly
all her accommodation sold. The other
vessels are'also filling up fast. .
The schooner Sophie Sutherland has
been sold to the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company. She will be overhauled and
may be sent north with supplies to Nome.
There was a chapter of accidents on the
front yesterday. Philip Olsen of the
steamer Hathor had this thumb- cut off.
The hatch fell en it and took the member
off close to the palm of the hand. He was
treated by Dr. Hopper at the Harbor Hos
pital. . Jack Williams, 'a 'longshoreman,
got into a fight with an Italian over the
war in South Africa. Williams, who is an
Irishman, sided with the Boers, and. in
consequence Dr. Dray had to patch up the
side of his face, mend his index . finger
and â¢ sew up a four-inch scalp wound . at
the Harbor Hospital. .

CARRIE C. SANKEY'S
ESTATE IN PROBATE
Her Death Recalls the Interesting
Litigation by Which She Re
. covered a Large Fortune. â¢ ;
Public Administrator Boland has applied
for letters of administration upon the
estate of .Carrie C Sankey, who died sud
denly at the home of K. A. Lundstrom on
Tuesday afternoon. A few Â¦ months ago
Miss Sankey was the plaintiff in a sensa
tional suit brought to compel Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Coggins to reconvey prop
erty valued at $40,000 which she had deed
ed to them under undue influence. The
trial of the case lasted several weeks and
Miss Sankey was the victor. It was
proved that in addition to conveying the
property in question Miss Sankey also
bore the major portion of the expenses of
the Coggins household and furnished the
defendants with other than necessities.
Coggins was Miss Sankey's guardian, and
he contested her suit with vigor, but with
out avail. The reconveyance of the prop
erties in question had not been completed
when Miss Sankey was stricken with
heart disease and died. Public Adminis
trator Boland will now take charge of
her estate and transfer the fruits of her
legal victory to her heirs-at-law, as it is
understood she died intestate. Miss San
key was 29 years of age at the time of her
death. Â¦ Â¦
Heart Disease Caused Death.
The autopsy made last Wednesday night
by Morgue Surgeon Leland upon the body
or Miss Caroline Sankey, who died sud
denly last Tuesday . afternoon, revealed
heart dilation as the cause of death. Ow
ing to the fact that the deceased was only
29 years old and apparently a healthy and
vigorous woman It was thought best to
submit the h stomach for examination
to the city, chemist. That official reported
unofficially that he had not yet finished
his examination and chemical analysis,
but that as far as he had gone he had
found no indications of poison.

ADVERTISING IN
PUBLIC PUCES
IS IN DISFAVOR
Supervisors' Committee Will
Approve Submitted
Ordinances.
Legality of the Measures to Be De
termined â Unsightly and Gro
tesque Signs Under the
Ban.
? The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday took up the proposition to regu
late advertising on fences and public
places. T. T. Williams submitted two
ordinances to cover the existing abuses.
The first ordinance presented provides
that it shall be unlawful for any person
or corporation to build or maintain any
fence or frame of wood covered with can
vas or other inflammable material within
the limits of the city and county without
first obtaining a permit of the Fire War
dens; that no permit shall be given for the
maintenance of such fences over eight feet
in height nor if 'they constitute a menace
to life or property or are liable to Inter
fere with the work of the Fire Depart
ment in extinguishing fires, of which the
Fire Warden shall be the sole judge. The
ordinance also provides that such fences
are declared a public nuisance, which
must be abated forthwith by the Chief of
Police and Fire Department.
The second ordinance is similar to the
first, but is intended to regulate the build*
ing of fences around any vacant lot or
portion thereof, and limits their height to
ten feet.
Replying to a question . of Supervisor
Connor, Mr. Williams said that the meas
ures were sweeping in character and will
prohibit electric signs in front of thea
ters.
"The newspapers," said Mr. Williams,
"are willing to take in every sign and
billboard they now use for advertising
purposes in the, city. The abuse of elec
tric advertising signs was evidenced j by,
the great trouble the firemen experienced
in New York City. The newspapers em
ploy a large number of men, pay high
wages, and their interests should be con
sidered along with the claims of advertls-.
ing companies. The theaters are a nui
sance in their advertising, for they send
out a score of men on a dark night to
paste posters all over the. town. Regard
ing the claim of advertisers that they are
heavy taxpayers, Owens & Varney have
no real estate and pay taxes on personal
property assessed at $1400. Slebe & Green's
personal' property is assessed for $1175.
The ordinance aims to cover cases where,
large and unsightly signs are placed in
front of buildings.
A. Dijeau and E. L. Clapp of the San
Francisco Labor Council opposed the ordl
naces, claiming they would deny, labor
unions the privilege of advertising their
meetings and notices of boycotts on
wagons. They contended it would.be but
fair to deny the right to every business
man to advertise on the wagons he owns.
. Supervisor Maguire stated that the com
mittee desired to adopt an ordinance that
Â¦would be uniform and result in the re
moval of all unsightly advertisements. The
two ordinances presented by Mr. Williams
and another directed at the grotesque ad
vertising features now in vogue seemed
to meet with the approval of the mem
bers. They, were rsferred to the Judiciary
Committee to determine their legality.

/HE SAI* FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1900.
C. P. HUHTINGTON
PARTS WITH HIS
PULLMAN SHARES
Southern Pacific Is Paid a
Big Sum for Its
Interests.
Cars Will Be Leased in the Future on
a Mileage Schedule and Not
Bun Jointly as Here
tofore. ;
A deal has Just been consummated In
New York between C. P. Huntlhgton and
the .Pullman Palace Car Company by
which the latter comes Into absolute con
trol of all the Pullman cars used on the
Southern Pacific Company's lines. Â¦ ,
This" change, which has been rumored
for the last year and a half, involves the
transfer to the Pullman Car Company of
the three-fourths interest in the Pullman
cars used on the Southern Pacific tracks.
Previous to ISS3 the Southern Pacific
Company ran Its own sleeping cars under
the name of the Silver palace cars. In
that year a deal was entered into between
them and the Pullman people by which
the Southern Pacific agreed to sub
stitute Pullmans for their old â¢ car
service on the condition of being
â¢allowed to own a- three-fourths in
terest in all the Pullman rolling stock
used on their roads. They paid three
fourths of the cost of the cars, the same
proportion of the expenses of running
them and divided the accruing profits at
the same ratio. This contract, which was
for fifteen -years, expired in 1898, and nego
tiations have been going on ever since be
tween the two companies for the sale of
the entire interest to one or the other of
them. Pending the culmination of these
negotiations the old contract was by mu
tual agreement continued In force.
The recent sale is the end of the matter,
and henceforth the management of the
whole business will be in the hands of the
Pullmans. The sale affects the transfer of
about seventy-five cars and .the payment
of 11,500,000.
In the future the Southern Pacific Com
pany will hire cars from the Pullman peo
ple in such numbers as they are required.
The ' conduct and entire management of
these cars will be in the hands of the
Pullman Company, who will run them in
all their 'details, merely being paid so
much by the Southern Pacific Company
for the time they are used in the transpor
tation of the latter company's passengers.
Presumably the payment for their hire
will be based on a mileage schedule.
This arrangement will benefit the trav
eling public from the fact that it will
probably result in a better class of cars
being put on the run. Heretofore it was
to the interest of both the Pullman people
and the Southern Pacific .Company to
economize as much as possible and to use
the cheapest and the oldest cars that the
traveling public would stand for. Now it
will be to the Interest of the Southern
Pacific to make their road as attractive
as any other and to get the best the Pull
mans have to offer.

The revenue cutter McCulloch sailed for
Monterey yesterday on a practice cruise.
The Norwegian steamer Leander was
delayed three days owing to the Insurance
companies objecting: to the manner In
which the cargo was stowed. The two
launches built by the Fulton Iron Wonca
for P. W. Mordln & Co. of Siberia were
the bone of contention. They were not
properly placed on deck, and the agents of
the vessel had to go to considerable ex
pense in getting the matter satisfactorily
adjusted.
All of the quarantined fleet are still off
Angel Island. The Duke of Fife will be
released on Saturday and will go to the
Presidio to discharge the remains of the
soldiers now aboard. The Gaelic is still
held because the result of the experiments
with the blood taken from the sick China
man are not yet completed. The Charles
Nelson will be released to-day and the
Centennial on Sunday. The stern-wheeler
Caroline, that went out to the Gaelic
when she came in, was also quarantined,
but she will be released to-day. These are
busy times for Dr. Klnyoun.
