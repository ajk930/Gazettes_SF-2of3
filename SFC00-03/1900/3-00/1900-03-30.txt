In 1383 Edward McMurdo, an American
citizen, obtained a concession from Port
ugal, to build a railroad fifty-seven miles
long from Lourenzo , Marques to Komati
' Poort, on the Transvaal border, there to
connect 'with a line to be built by the
Netherlands Company on to Pretoria, 290
miles farther. McMurdo organized a com
pany In London under the name of the
Delagoa Bay Railroad Company for Its
construction. It was not completed within
the time set and was several times extend
ed, and Portugal, declaring the concession
forfeited, seized and completed the work.
On remonstrance by Great Britain and
the United States the matter was referred
to M. Joseph Blasi. Vice President of the
Swiss Federal Tribunal: M. Charles Sol
dan,' president of the Council of State,
Canton de Vaud. and M. Andreas Heuss
ler. professor of law at Basle University,
for arbitration, the Government of Port
ugal having presented a counter-claim.
To this the company made a reply 'and
Portugal rejoined, with which both par*
ties rested their case.
PREMIER SCHREINER'S
ATTITUDE QUESTIONED
LOKDOX, March 23.â In the House of
Lords to-day the Earl of Camperdown
asked a series of questions bearing upon
the various allegations concerning Pre
mier Schreiner's attitude toward the war.
Th*e Earl of Selborne, Under Secretary of
State for the Colonies, replied that a self
governing colony was bound to do every
thing possible to defend Its territory
against Invasion. Generally speaking, he
added, the land defense lay with the col
ony, while the defense of the coaling sta
tions or attack by sea devolved upon the
motherland.
- tSo part of her Majesty's dominions, the
Under Secretary of War continued, can
claim to be at peace with a power with
Vhich her Majesty is at war. It Is unjust
to say that ihe Cape Government had de
clined to call out Us forces. It had called
out the volunteers to the extent the Gov
ernor considered wise. While the Cape
Ministry had not on even* point held
views identical with those officials respon
sible for the conduct of the war. It was
<juite unjust to accuse the Cdlonial Min
isters of declining to call out troops.
Clearly it was much better that some of
the burgher forces should not be called
out. for it was a, matter of common no
toriety that part of the forces could not
be relied on.
Regarding the question of liability for
damages, the Under Secretary said the
Government aimed to endeavor to- exact
compensation from those who caused the
damage. The question, he added, con
cerned both the Colonial and Imperial
Governments, but principally the Colonial
Government, which was responsible to the
parties injured and ought to co-operate
Â¦with the Imperial Government to see that
those who caused the damage paid for it.

LATEST REPORT
FROM LORD ROBERTS
LONDON. March Â».â The War Office
has received the following dispatch from
Lord Roberts, dated Bloemfontein, March
28:
"General Clements occupied Fauresmlth
to-day . without opposition. One nine
pounder and one Martini-Maxim were dis

HERBERT GLADSTONE'S VIEWS.
LONDON, March 23.â Speaking at the
breakfast of the Liberal agents at Not
tingham to-day, Herbert Gladstone, son
of the late William E. Gladstone and
member of Parliament for West Leeds,
declared that nearly all the Liberals had
agreed in regard to the settlement of the
South African question that it was the
duty of the Government to make recur
rence of the war impossible, and show the
world that British power in South Africa
was predominant and that the British flag
must wave over the whole of South Af
rica.
HOLDING SOUTHERN FRONTIER.
ALIWAI. NORTH. March . 23.â General
Brabant and his staff have returned from
Rouxville and are now actively engaged
in holding the southern frontier of tho
Free State. Detachments are* being sent
to strengthen the positions which have
been occupied. It is evident that Com
mandant Olivier, now moving north, is be
ing closely watched by Sir Godfrey Lang
don, the Basutoland Commissioner, who is
In communication with General French.
NORFOLK'S SUCCESSOR.
LONDON. March 30.â The Standard,
which Is an excellent source of Govern
ment Intelligence, says that the Marquis
of Londonderry will be appointed Post
master General, to succeed the Duke of
Norfolk, who has gone to South Africa.
LONDON, March 30.â Beyond some
indecisive fighting at Warrenton,
where a large Boer force confronts
Lord Methuen, there has been no
news of great importance to-day
from the seat of war. Until Lord Rob
erts begins his advance, which, it is
thought In a well-informed quarter here,
will be early next week, Methuen Is not
likely to make any attempt to drive back
the Boers in front of him.
The recall of the British troops rrom
the Barkley West district and Griqua
town, northwest of Klmberley, would
seem to indicate that preparations for a
general advance northward by the British
armies are nearly completed. One thing
which has been delaying Lord Roberts is
a lack of warm clothing for the troops.
Dispatches from various points In. Cape
Colony, Natal, contain evidences that the
policy of severe punishment of the Dutch
inhabitants who took up arms against the
Queen is being strongly pushed. Winston
Churchill appears to be the only corre
spondent" who advocates dealing with the
co-called rebels in a spirit of conciliation.
The others- all harp upon the great in
justice which will be done loyal colonists
unless Â£ those who rebelled are harshly
dealt with. Some maintain that, a con
fiscation of property, or Imprisonment
even or death is the only ' punishment
commensurate with their offense. . Meet-
Ings* are being organised all over the
colony to indorse the policy of complete
extermination of the two republics. .
There seems to:be some foundation for
found advisable. There are grounds for
suspicion, however. that President
Kruger does not intend to destroy,prop
erty, but hopes by this means to induce
foreign Investors to endeavor to force
their respective governments to intervene.

Wednesday, says: "President Kruger boasts his intention to retake Bloemfontein within a week, and it
appears probable that the Boers are advancing in force southward." . .
A dispatch to the Daily Chronicle from Bloemfontein/ dated March 28, says,: "The Boers are ac

T ONDON, -March 29.â
/ Additional details are at
hand to-day in regard to
the execution of ex-Sergeant
Major Thomas Greener of the
Royal Engineers in South Af
rica for desertion to the enemy.
He did not desert, as re
ported, at the first opportunity
thai presented itself after the
arrival of his command in
South Africa, nor did he desert
to the enemy directly. He de
serted from Aldershot in 1894,
and for the last six years a civil
warrant, with his description,
has been in the hands of tlte
constables and police all over
Great Britain.
Greener was concerned in the wholesale stealing of waste lead
and spelter from the balloon zuorks at Aldershot, and fled in 1894 to
escape arrest. It is now known that he went to America, and after
some stay in the mining district of California went to Australia and
thence to the Transvaal in 1897. c was mploy ed Â°n the Rand,
and on the breaking out of the war took service with the Boers and
was made en officer of engineers. On being captured he was recog
nised and questioned and admitted his identity. A court-martial sen
tenced him to be shot, and he met his death like a soldier.
By many his execution is regarded as unjustifiable; even under
strict interpretation of military law. He is said to have become a
citizen of the Transvaal.

WILD STORY CONCERNING
FOREIGNERS WITH BOERS
LONDON, March 29.â A London Times
correspondent, heretofore considered to
be quite in the confidence of Lord Rob
erts, cables that the Boer forces have
been re-equipped, and he says he is
fully convinced that 150,000 foreign troops
have been landed to aid the republics.
From this the Inference might be drawn
that the London critics have been pre
mature in prophesying an immediate ad
vance, as at Kimberley and Paardeberg.
The 'best based conjecture is well nigh
worthless as to when Lord Roberts con

Just before the beginning of the war Lord Cecil, who had been
for some time in South Africa, was in Kimberley on his way to
Maf eking to assist in preparing for a siege. On inquiry he found
that only a certain quantity of provisions had been ordered to be sent
up to Maf eking, hardly sufficient for six weeks. He at once sought
the contractor, and giving him his personal obligation, amounting to
Â£40,000, for the excess, had the Government order quadrupled and
forwarded at' once.
DENVER, March 29.â -With a special train rushing across the - continent, j the Santa Fe is trying to

ROUTE OF THE FLYER ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
TRANSPORTATION IN : SOUTH AFRlCAâ Finding the Drift in Flood-Water.
The forward movement of Lord Roberts'/army toward the Transvaal border. will doubtless stay for some time on the:
settlement of the question of transportation. The single track railroad running through, the Orange Free State, along
which he will for the most part advance, will fall far short of the requirements of his force, even If left undisturbed by the -
Boer guerrillas. The mules and horses, that have been carried by the thousands to South Africa, are not to be depended
Â¦upon as the fall season is now at hand and they will have to go through a spell of acclimation fever, with a kind of pneu
monia under which a large percentage of them will die. Those that get through all right will be said to be "salted." and
will be as fit for hard service as a "Texas pony." The third and easiest system of transportation, when it can be provided
on sufficiently large scale, is the South African ox team, with its Kaffir drivers. The oxen are slow and the drivers lazy. '
but under the stimulus of threat or reward held out by an officer, who keeps them always under his eye, fairly good work
can be got' out of them. The picture, taken from IHie Spear, shows a train of ox wagons in the act of crossing a river, .
which is enough in flood to hide the regular drift, much to the bewilderment of the Kaffir boy In the lead.

"A short time ago I pointed out that

United" States Charge D'Affaires
Lloyd C. Griscom Lodges an
Emphatic ' Protest Against
thY Embargo.
CONSTANTINOPLE, March 29.-The
Porte has informed the United States le
gation that in future the importation of
American pork will be 'prohibited, giving
as a reason for the prohibition that the
meat Is injurious to the public health.
Lloyd C. Grlscom. United States Charge
d'Affaires. protested energetically, de
manding the Humiliation of the measure.
WASHINGTON, March 29.'â Secretary
of. Agriculture Wilson said to-day that he
had no official information that Turkey
has prohibited the importation of Ameri
can pork. If any steps were taken In the
matter by this Government, he said, the
Staie Department would conduct the ne
gotiations. :
"If.it has been, decided to -bar out all
pork," said the Secretary, "there can be
no cause for complaint, but if American
pork is discriminated against we will have
good cause to protest, as there can be no
valid reason for excluding it, as it is the
best in the world."
It is probable that the action of the
Porte was taken on religious grounds, as
the religion of the Turks prevents them
from eating pork. Statistics oh file at this
department ahow that during the past five
years. the value of, hog. products exported
from the United States to Turkey has
averaged $13 a year.
Mr. Grlscom has acted of his own voli
tion in lodging a protest, for the State
Department has not yet been Informed of
the prohibition of the Turkish Govern
ment. It may be stated, however, that
his action is thoroughly commended by
the officials and he will be supported to
the utmost In his protest. While it can
not be so stated officially, no doubt is en
tertained here that the action of the
Turkish Government is directly attributa
ble to the secret influence of some Con
tinental powers whose position in resist
ance to the demands of the United States
for the admission of American meat pro
ducts might be strengthened could they
point to similar exclusive action by other
opwers based on sanitary, considerations.
CAPTAIN OF
POLICE THOMAS
IS INDICTED
New York Grand Jury Finds
, Three True, Bills w
Against Him.
Convicted Practically on His Own
Testimony for Failure to Close
Â¦ : '*;l Notorious Resorts in the
Tenderloin. . _ *
, NEW YORK. March 29.â The investiga
tion into the charges, that vice flourished
openly in this city under police protec
tion reached a sensational climax to-day
when the Grand Jury returned three in
dictments against Police Captain Andrew
J. Thomas, Tn command of the tenderloin
precinct.
For nearly two weeks the Grand Jury,
of which George H. Putnam, the pub
lisher, is foreman, has been considering
the conditions . of the tenderloin precinct.
True i bills were found against Captain
Thomas under section 154 of the Penal
Code, which provides that the failure of
any public officer to: fulfill his duty id
guilty of a misdemeanor. I'he offense Is
punishable by a fine of $500 or . by one
year's imprisonment or by. both such fine
and imprisonment.
Specifically Captain Thomas is charged
with failing to close the resorts in tfie
tenderloin, such as the Tivoll, Bohemia,
Haymarket, Arcadia, Peking, etc., against
which a public crusade has been waged
for nearly a month.
The indicted man was convicted prac
tically, on his ownr testimony and that of
Policeman Barry, a roundsman of. his
precinct, although on the same case Dr.
Parkhurst, two of his detectives and many
others tesuued before the Grand Jury. '
Ceptaln Thomas admitted on the stand
that resorts complained of. were open
nightly In his precinct. In this he was
corroborated by Roundsman Barry and all
the other Witnesses. .
Captain Thomas was not arrested to
night. He .will, appear . before Recorder
Goff to-morrow. ' Chief of Police Dever/
was informed of the Indictment and whÂ«n
asked if he would suspend Captain
Thomas said:' "L shall not suspend Cap
tain Thomas on such trivial charges, ihe
whole affair is nonsensical."
Captain Thomas himself was not offi
cially notified of the Indictment and he
said he did not believe any indictment
against him had been found.

WASHINGTON. March 29.â The Coeur
d'Alene investigation opened to-day with
no outward evidence of the exciting
events of yesterday, although there was
considerable good-natured raillery among
members as to when the "first round"
would be called. Governor Steunenberg
was again on the^Â»tand, with Representa.
tive Lentz conducting the cross-examina
tion.
The evidence was on unimportant de
tails until Governor Steunenberg ' was
questioned as to a recent petition from the
Coeur d'Alene district asking the Secre
tary of War to retain -Federal troops
there. This petition has not yet been pre
sented to the Federal authorities, and the
committee went Into executive session to
determine what to do with the document.
The committee decided in- executive ses
sion to file the petition from the Coeur
d'Alenes with the Secretary of War, and
in the meantime It will not be made pub
lic. It Is understood, however, that it is
an r extensive document, bearing about
1500 names, and states in substance that
while people at a distance may regard
the policy adopted by the Governor and
military authorities as harsh, yet that the
signers fully uphold the policy adopted,
and consider it necessary to overcome the
lawlessness and disorder, which it states
has existed for some time. It requeststhe
Secretary of War to continue the guard
of troops in the Coeur d'Alene district. .
Governor Steunenberg's â¢ examination
was resumed at the open session, develop
ing little additional evidence, and at the
noon hour the committee adjourned until
to-morrow.
COST OF THE
TRANSPORTS IN
THE SERVICE
Enormous Sums Expended
in Maintaining the .-^
Various Vessels, r- - .
Acting Secretary Meiklejohn Sends a
Beport From the Quartermas-
ter's Department to the
Senate.
WASHINGTON. March 29.â Acting Sec
retary Meiklejohn has sent a report from
the quartermaster general to the Senate
in reply to a resolution of January 9 last,
calling upon the Secretary' of War for a
list of all transport ships and, other ves
sels purchased or chartered by the War
Department since March 4. 1897. together
with their names, from whom purchased
or chartered, the cost of purchase or char
ter, the cost of fitting up or repair and
the number and names of vessels sold and
the reasons for such action.
The department's answer is In the form
of three large, tables, replying specifically
to the various inquiries of the Senate.
From these it appears that only one ves
sel was sold, the steam tug Atlantic,
which was worn out and condemned. 1 She
brought $1509. The transport Hooker,
whien was fitted up for laying a deep-sea
cable in the Philippines, grounded near
Corregidor Island while en route from
Manila to Hongkong and was lost. The
steam lighter .Bessie became the property
of the Government under the terms of the
charter lor $ll',; > 07 und was renamed the
Kearney.
It is shown that thirteen . vessels have
been purchased by the quartermaster's
department since March 4, liSl, exclusive
of those purchased for- the army trans
port service for transportation Incident to
the Spanish war. These included the
ferry-ooat John Hancock, the steam tugs
General Hunt, Martha and John Barry
and ten steam launches, at a total cost of
J112.479, .with $9225 tor repairs. Forty-nine
vessels of all classes were purchased for
the army transport service , during and
feince the Spanish war. Including about
twenty-five . small craft, such as tugs,
launches and lighters, purchased Â¦in the
Philippines. The total purchase price ot
these vessels was $$,074,455 and the total
cost of refitting and repairing was $5,189,
093. The most expensive vessels were the
transports Grant, Logan, Sherman, Sheri
dan. Thomas and Hancock. The purchase
price of the- first five named was $660,000
each, and that ot the. Hancock, $600,000.
The expense of fitting up these vessels
ia stated as follows: ,
Hancock $543,516, Grant $328,459, Logan
$4t3,WS. Sheridan $339,169, Sherman $526.90.4,
Thomas $336,365. .'lt thus appears that' the
Hancock, ' Logan and . Sherman cost | over
one million dollars each and the other
three named a slightly less amount. J The
purchase price for the transport Meade
was $400.000, ; and $374,000 was expended' ln
fitting her up. â¢?.-.:
The purchase price of the Sumner was
$160,594 and $250.0u0 additional was expend
ed in fitting her up. The original cost of
the hospital ship- Relief was $450,000 and
$265,591 was expended in her transforma
tion.
The hospital ship Missouri has cost the
Government so far 1430,612, of. which a lit
tle more than half was expended in adapt
ing her to hospital purposes. Two of the
Urge transports. Burnslde and Hooker,
are captured Spanish steamers.
All the principal transports were ac
quired under the terms of their charters
and were paid for out of the appropriation
for the national defense. There were 147
vessels chartered for the transport serv
ice at a total cost of $10,673,519 for services
rendered, and a total cost of $1,5!Â»4.342 in
restoring them to their original condition
on cancellation of charters. ;. Of the char
tered vessels seventy-nine were attached
to the Atlantic fleet at -a cost for service
of $2.852.254 and for repairs of $175,680. The
remaining sixty-eight chartered vessels
were employed on the Pacific Coaatat a
cost of Jv.749,235 for service and $107,608 for
repairs. -

WORK OF THE
PHILIPPINE
COMMISSION
Primary Purpose Will Be
Establishment of Civil
Government.
Scope of the New Body Will Be Much
More Extended Than Was That
of Its Recent Pre- . :
d?oessor.
"WASHINGTON, March 29.â The Philip
pine, Commission met to-day and agreed
upon the personnel of thÂ» staff that I? to
I accompany the commission to Manila
They. agreed en certain outlines which
they will follow in their work in the Phil
ippines. '," These -will- be submitted to the
Secretary of War this afternoon.
tt By appointment the; commission waited
on secretary Root about 3 o'clock in the
, ajfternoon; and they spent -three hours be
hind closed doors in earnest, conference.
At the conclusion- of the conference the
Secretary said that the discussion had
1 covered the probable scope of the work of
the commission : for: the next two years.
So far he hud not been able to present the
Commissioners written instructions, and
what, passed to-day was rather prepara
tory t'> the reception of those instruc
tions. ; It was not the- intention at this
time to.mrjke the instructions public, but
it.mipht br stated in general terms, the
Secretary paid, that the new commission
would have much broader powers in deal
ing with the problems arising In the Phil
ippines than; had its predecessor. The
primary purpose was the establishment of
local civil government throughout the isl
and. In the selection of the civil officers
the commission would have a free hand.
When asked, whether the civil authorities
would dominate the military, the Secre
tary contented himself with the reply that
as he saw it.no question was likely to
urise on that . point; there . would be no
chance. for friction.
The. commission will meet again to-mor
row and will continue the conference with
Secretary Root, In the afternoon. That
will be the last meeting of the full com
mission In Washington before the depart
ure' for -Manila. The members will dine
with the President at the White House
to-morrow evening, and to-morrow night
three of them. General Wright, Judge Ide
and .Professor Worcester, will go to their

sion, goes to New York on Saturday, but
will return to Washington before starting
on his voyage. Professor Moses also
leaves Saturday, going directly to his
home tn California. The commission will
gather at San Francisco on April 12 and
will sail for Manila on the lath on the
army transport Hancock.
The personnel of the attaches Â£.nd staff
has been practically completed, but Judge
Taft preferred to defer the announcement
of their names until to-morrow In order to
comply with certain necessary formalities.
EVIDENCE TO
HANG GOVERNOR
OF KENTUCKY
Witness in the Goebel Case
Makes Startling States ; ; ,C
ments.
Declares That if Prisoner Youtzey
Should Confess What.he Knows
Taylor's Life Would be.
in Danger. ' . J-
LEXINGTON. Ky. .March 29. â The
Morning Herald of this city will print to
morrow the folio-wing special from Win
chester. Ky. :
"If Youtzey will tell what I think he
knows he can hang Taylor and .destroy
the Republican party. I feel pure that
I can arrange for enough of the appro
priation for Youtzey to make him and
his wife comfortable for the rest of their
lives. Culton is going to confess in the
morning and Youtzey had better get in
while he can. The money is going and
he miffht as w*Â»ll have his phare."
The above is what James AnCrew Scott
said at the Reese House Monday night.
He Â»Â«? addressing N. H. Witherspoon
and Judge C. S. French, respectively
brother - in - law and father - in - law
of Youtzey. Scott had telephoned With
erspoon early in the afternoon, "Meet me
at the Reese House on the quiet," and he
had been promptly met. Judge French
Â¦was later railed, as the head of the fam
ily, who should be consulted in a matter
of such Importance. The party ttayed in
consultation until midnight, Scott Insist
ing that -Youtzey should confess and make
himself rich, while the others listened
passively a nd then replied:
" Youtzey has told all he knows and can
ray. r<i*hinsr more."
Srott dwelt en the point t na t Culton
would confess the next day, and unless
Youtzey pot tn his story first the other
man would pet away with the money, but
neither Witherspoon nor French would ac
cede to the request for Scott to go to
Frankfort and advise Youtzey to tell a
etory which would hang Taylor and darn
age the Republican party.
Scott Bald Youtzey would have to leave
the Btate because of the feeling aroused,
but that he would have money to sweeten
hi* exile. The story' was told freely on
the streets to-day, and It was further
etated that Brott had assured Wither
spoon and French that they would be
further communicated with before any at
tempt should be made to arrest Youtzej*.
The report of this arrest was therefore a.
surprise.

ing affairs here to be watched after by

later by a warrant charging him v.ith
complicity in the Goebel murder. The ar
ie.s=t on the oldcapia's was for the purpose
of preventing him from getting away in
case he Is wanted.
6ince the detectives left last night there
have been all sorts of reports as to whom
they are after. â¢
Combs was convicted in this city two
year* apo of running a blind tiger and
flned $4000. which would have kept him in
jail for more than twelve years. Shortly
after his conviction Combs escaped nnd

Associated with Colonel Holliday in the
founding- of Topeka were the late Charles
Robirson and Samuel J. Crawford, both
of whom afterward became Governors ot
Kansas. After iayir.R out the town site
of Topeka Colont-I Holliday led the flpht
which resulted in the selection of Topeka
as the capital cf the Slate. In the eari>
days the people of Kansas were "hampered
t>y the lack ot facilities to get their prod
uct* to market. Colonel Holliday con
ceived the* idea of a railroad. He imme
diately began work on it ar.d the railway
eystexn that now extends from Chicago
to the Pacific Cotst and the iJulf of Mcx- |
ieo stands as a great monument to his ef
forts. His original idea was to build a
railroad to iht? City of Mexico and San
Francisco. When he unfolded his plans
to the moneyed men of the East they
laughed at him. Their laughter had no
effect upon him. He was indefatigable In
his effort and at last was successful fn
floating sufficient bonds to start the laying
of the rails 1 . The construction started
both ways out of Topeka. When the con
struction pane reached Osape City, forty
miles west cf Topeka.. a jubilee was held.
In a speech Cokinel Hollidajr predicted the
road would become one of the great
transcontinental line? of the country. He
orpanis<Â»d the company and was made its
first president. He has been on the direc
torate ever since, being one of the heav
iest stockholders in the company.
Topeka people refer to him as "the
faxher of Topeka"; the Santa Fe officials
as "the father of the Santa Fe."

LOS ANGELES, March 29.â St Louis
tdbk the Pacific Coast Jobbers' Associa
tion .by surprise' before the Interstate
Commerce Commission - this morning by
the Introduction of J. R. Newberry. a
retail and Jobbing grocer of Los Angeles,
who testified that the freight differentials
have.^been disastrous to retailers.. -He
Btateo..; that the differentials have made
possible a combine among the jobbers in
groceries whereby they raised prices from
5 to 20 per cent above former prices. .He
conforms his Jobbing rates to those set
forth in the printed price list Issued ' by
the jobbers, and illustrated the effect of
the combine by saying that he retails
canned corn at 90 cents per dozen and
Jobs it at $L Many varieties of goods, he
stated, are based on adding the differen
tials to the selling price of Eastern 1 Job
bers.' He stated that when the present
rates were established In June, 1898, prices
of groceries were advanced by the Job
;bers 5 to 20 per cent, and he was informed
that unless he conformed to the rates
established by them they would not sell
to him. The witness agreed to furnish
.the Commissioners with a copy of the
printed price list Issued by the Jobbers.
C. C. Pixley, a retail hardware man of
Orange, testified against the differentials,
which he claimed to be detrimental to
general retail business on the coast, re
stricting the purchasing market.
John McFadden, a hardware dealer of
Santa Ana, testified that when the pres
ent rates were established coast' jobbers
advanced prices, Eastern Jobbers grant-
Ing allowances on freight to offset differ
entials.
Ira Hill, a dealer In hardware in the
same town, testified to the same effect,
adding that the differentials have caused
a restriction of the purchasing market to
such an extent that it Is difficult to meet
the requirements of his customers. He
introduced in evidence a circular bearing
the title Pacific Coast Price List, giving
prices which the witness said Rre enforced
by Jobbers along the entire coast. It was
accompanied with another circular giving
discounts from the prices. No firm or
associated name appeared on either cir
cular.
Fruit Growers' Complaints.
At 11:30 o'clock the case was submitted
to the Commissioners and the case of the
United Forwarding Company and the
Southern California Fruit Exchange
against the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe roads was called. Judge C. A. Sterry.
representing the Santa Fe. said that he
would move that each article in the com
plaints be stricken out, the railroads
holding that with possibly one exception
they raised issues over which the commis
sion lacks jurisdiction.
At the afternoon session he addressed
the Commissioners for about two hours,
taking the ground that the railroads are
simply neutral parties to this controversy,
which is in reality between the car lines
and the citnis fruit shippers. He claimed
that the Commissioners lack Jurisdiction
in dealing with the questions brought be
fore them, particularly the one charging
the roads with maintaining a pool on
citrus fruit shipments.- He Insisted that
the questions raised are unusual ones and
thought the Commissioners were not yet
prepared to. consider them.. He claimed
that there was no charge that the alleged
contract between the railroads Â¦ and : thft
car lines resulted In the roads taking Il
legal profits therefrom and that conse
quently It - was not a matter, for consid
eration by the Commissioners. He thought
the Commissioners should bring the real
parties to the controversyâ the car linesâ
before them. Instead of making the rail
roads the defendants. He denied that
the act to regulate commerce has affected
the right of the railroads to maintain such
agencies for carrying on their business as
Is thought by them to be best-
Attorney Hunsaker replied on behalf of
the complainants, giving citations show
ing: that the responsibility of refrigeration
rests on the railroads, regardless of any
contractB, and arguing that the roads
cannot delegate that responsibility. The
attorney quoted Vice President Stubba of
the Southern Pacific as saying that E. T.
Earle had been the heaviest shipper of
citrus fruits and that he had forced the
railroads to accept and use his car.lln*.
and he maintained that the railroads giv#
undue preference to Earle. He denied
that the commission had Jurisdiction over
the Carolines, who are mere servants of
the roads and not common carriers.
Duty of Commissioners.
Chalrman Clements said that the Com
missioners did' not consider it Incumbent
at* this, time- to decide all .the questions
raised; some of the questions now being In
the courts.. but he thought it best to pro
ceed to take all the evidence possible, as
It is a part of the duty of the Commis
sioners to report to Congress on all mat
ters affecting freights. The fruit busi
ness, he declared, had grown to immensa
proportions during the last fifteen years
and the application of new method* had
been necessary. To the success of this
Industry both the railroads and the grow
ers have contributed. Legislation affect-
Ing freights, as well as the railroad busi
ness, has been the result of common evo
lution, which has Â»eemed at times to move
slowly, but which !s nevertheless con
stantly progressing. As Charles Francis
Adams once said. It is desirable for the
Commissioners to help turn on the Hcht,
allowing all sides to present facts In full,
and It was the opinion of the Commission
ers that they should proceed with the tes
timony. If there Is Injustice in the pres
ent method that should be corrected as
soon as possible under the present laws
and If the laws are defective that should
be ascertained with a view to securing a
correction of them.
Petitions Filed-
Attorneys for Armour & Co. and E. T.
Earle, owners of fruit car linen, filed peti
tions In Intervention, to which objection
was raised by the complainants.
The Commissioners ruled that the peti
tions should be granted.
The complainants gave notice that they
had made a demand on the railroads for
the contracts between the railroads and
the car lines and W. F. Herrin presented
copies of the contracts between the South
ern Pacific and the car lines. The latter
misunderstood a Question of the com
plainants' attorney and replied that there
would be no copy of the contract agree
ment between the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe roads for the" division of profits,
for the reason that no such contract
exists.
To give the attorneys an opportunity to
examine the documents filed the Commis
sioners adjourned at 4:30 o'clock.

FREE TRADE PLAN FOR
PORTO RICO DEFEATED
Significant Vote in the Senate Shows
the Tariff and Government Bill
Will Be Passed.
WASITIKGTOX. March 29.â A direct
vote was taken by the Senate to-day on
the proposition to strike from the Porto
Rlcan mt-asure the proposition levying 13
per cent of the DinglÂ«ry law duties on
Porto Rico products. The proposition was
defeated by a vote of 16 to 33. While the
\*ote Is regarded as presaging the passage
of the pending measure. It Is not regarded
ns Indicating the final vote on the bill.
The feature of the debate was the speech
of Bevcridgre. While he advocated reci
procity between the United States and
Porto Rico, he announced that If all ef
forts to secure free trade should fail he
would support the pending bill. The bill
was under discussion throughout the ses-
Flcn. several Important amendments being
agreed to.
When the Senate opened the conference
rÂ«"i>crt on the diplomatic and consular ap
propriation bill was agreed to.
A concurrent resolution offered by Cul
bertson of Texas directing the Secretary
of War and the Secretary of the Xavy to
fceÂ«>p "seasonably advised the families of
wounded soldiers and sailors of the con
dition of men" was agreed to.
Consideration of the Porto Rlcan tariff
and povernment bill was then resumed,
Beveridge of Indiana addressing the Sen
ate in support of the proposition for free
trade Ix'twpen the United States and the
Islands of Porto Rico. BiÂ»verldge scJd:
For Freedom of Trade.
I faror Immediate reciprocity and I shall
sro on record as voting for amendments giv
ing immolate and unrestricted freedom of
trade to our Island of IVirto Rico. But If we.
In the Senate, who believe that Porto Rico
Fhould have reciprocity at once are not able
to so amend the bill here. I Fhall, after voting
for reciprocity amendments, vote for the civil
irovemment Mil as modified l<y the committee,
because we must tint .!<>ny civil government
to the people of Porto Klco a moment longer,
and bt-cause the bill as mofllfM Insures free
trade with Porto Rico as Â«>->n as the civil
ginernir.rat of that Island provides a sys
Â»em of taxation or Its own. So that the
eooner Porto Woo gets civil government the
Quicker It will get fife trade under the mod
ifications which the committee has made. I
fhould be glad If the bill could be co separated
that we mlpht vote for civil government with
out the revenue feature, although the com
mittee ha* modified that feature so as to ln
eure early freedom of trade. Hut. as the bill
ft&nd>. unless wÂ« can amend It, we must
vote for It as modified by the committee or
elee vote against civil government altogether
end civil government must no longer be de
nied to the people of Porto Rico. Delay of
civil government to these people Is dental of
Justice. And so I shall vote for the civil
government bill because It does establish civil
government at once and because under the
modification by the committee It also estab
lishes absolute reciprocity in the near future.
Master People of the World.
Mr. President, the preat movement on which
the American people have embarked is a move
ment of conscience as well as of power; of
civilization as well as of commerce. Directly
It affects all humanity. We go forth on a
Â¦world career; we must conduct It with a
Â¦world statesmanshipâ a statesmanship that
cr>nelderÂ» the effect of every law we pass upon
the. peoples over whom our Influence Is ex
tending and upon the world at large as well
as upon ourselves.
Sir. administration of #;3Terament means
more than balance sheets: more than- weights
or measure*. It means this, but It also means
the weirtinfc of the hearts of men and the
baJance sheet* of the affections of the gov
erned people. The American masses. In whose
t>rea*tÂ« dwell the purity, power and hope of
the rr-puMlc and of the world, understand this
well. They feel and deeply know that we
are henceforth the master people of thÂ« world;
they d^ubt not that human progress Is one
vast and Fwelllns; harmony, which not even
all the discords of history can destroy, and
they mean that in all thai divine and splendid
corn ;x* it lon. the noblest, highest, purest, the
tenJer^t ncte shall bÂ« that struck by the
American people as the sovereign power of the
earth.
Foraker then asked that the- Senate
proceed with the consideration of amend
ments.
Defeat of Amendments.
The first amendment was one Imposing
a duty of 5 cents a pound upon, coffee Im
ported from Porto Rico.
I'ettus of Alabama moved to strike out
the amendment, which motion involved
the question whether a tax could be lm
po.=oa upon products Imported Into Porto
*ilco which was not imposed on the same
jircKlucts imported Into other parts of the
Vnlt^d States."
Galllnger defended the amendment of
the committee. During the Spanish re
plme, he paid, a tariff had been Imposed
upon coffee Imported Into Porto Rico be
cause the coffee raised there Is regarded
a-Â« the best in the world and It was de
rided to prevent it from being ppoiled by
beinir blended with Inferior brands.
Pettus' amendment was defeatedâ l 3 to
Bacon of Georgia offered an amendment
In the form of a substitute for sections 2
and 3 of the committee bill, establishing
the regular Dlngley tariff rates of duty
on articles Imported from foreign coun
tries into Porto Rico and providing that
no dutiÂ«-s shall be levied upon articles Im
ported into Porto Rico from the United
States or Into the United States from
Porto Rico. Bacon explained that It was
his purpose to establish In Porto Rico the
tariff syptem in vogue in this country-
Gaillrger said the bill as it stood was
Infinitely more liberal than was the
amendment offered by Bacon.
Lindsay offered an amendment to Ba
con's amendment providing for absolute
free trmif between the United States and
Porto Rico.
Bacon accepted the amendment, and at
hip request the amendment went over un
til to-morrow.
FreÂ« Trade Plan Defeated.
Pettus of Alabama then moved to strike
out th* provision in the section providing
for a duty of 15 per cent of the Dlngley
law rat's on products of Porto Rico lm'
ported Into this country. The motion of
Pettus was defeated, 16 to 33, as follows: '

fnUn-wlntf Senators, who wtre absent from the
chamber when their names were called: Allen,
JÂ»aviÂ», McO>ir.J>er. Mallory, Nelson, Proctor,
ttewart, Thurston. Tlllman and West.
Th<Â» next committee amendment was
that which provided that the Spanish or
native inhabitants of Porto Rico and their
children should be citizens of Porto Rico.
and as such entitled to the protection of
the T.'nitr-d States. ,
Morgan maintained that the people of
Porto Rico were citizens of the United
States, and as such were entitled to the
rights and Immunities prescribed by the
constitution. The amendment, he said,
Â¦wiis a vain and empty declaration.
It W-came evident that the amendment
could not be disposed of to-day and it was
jiass<-d over until to-morrow.
Morgan offered an amendment to the
Becttoa of the bill which proposes to re
de* m the Porto Rlcan silver coins In
Unlu-d States money, giving Â£0 cents In
Anurir-an money for the Porto Rlcan
jx-so. The amendment proposed to pay
100 cfnts for the peso. Morgan held that
In th> proposed exchange of coins the
TTnitPd States wag taKlng advantage of
the Porto Rlcans. because the peso con
tained the Fame amount of silver as the
American dollar. The Porto Ricans. he
declared, arc entitled to 100 cents for their
pesos, because that amount of silver in
money would be worth 100 cents on the
dollar.
Jnm-* of Arkansas and Bacon of Georgia
took the same position. Foraker main
tained that the position of the Democratic
Senators was not correct. There was no
Intention to deprive the Porto Ricans of
any value, as the American dollar now
was worth in debt-paying power practi
cally two pesos in Porto Rico. He be
lieved the proposition of the bill was en
tirely liberal to the Porto Rlcans. The
Senate then, at 4:45 p. m., adjourned.
Army Appropriation Bill Passed.
WASHINGTON. March 29.â After four
flays of stormy debate the House to-day
passed the army appropriation bill. As
passed the bill Is only slightly modified
from the form In which Jt came from the
committee. One of the last amendments
adopted opens the soldiers' homes to the
officers and men of the volunteer and reg
ular armies Incapacitated by service dur
ing or since the Spanish war. The chief
incident of the day was a defense of the
War Department against the charge of
reckless" extravagance In the fitting up of
the transport Sumner, made by Drlggs of
New York yesterday. Parker of New Jer
sey produced the itemized expenses fur
nished by the "War Department to show
that there had been no extravagance.
Without opposition the House confirmed
Boreing'p title to his peat. His seat was
contested by Mr. White, another Republi
can, and the report of the committee that
investigated the case was xinanimously in
favor of the sitting member.

McCraryt who will resume and finish his
argument In the morning. It Is the gen
eral opinion that the Jury will fall to
agree or else the defendant will not be
convicted. Much sympathy Is shown for
her and the arguments of the attorneys
for the State give evidence that sympathy
might result in acquittal.
Judge Ragan made a prolonged argu
ment for the State, In which he scored At
torney Morey, who arose and asked the
protection of the court. At the close of
his argument Judge Ragan became ill and
was taken from the courtroom. A phy

Notwithstanding a Heavy Downpour
the â¢ Temple Was Not Large
Enough for the Throng.

Sudden Termination of War
Between Ping Kongs and

Arrest of Ah Keong , Satisfactorily
â¢ Explained and. the Warring
Tongs Agree to Lay Down
Their Hatchets. >
â¢ '
The trouble which existed between tho
Ping Kong Tong and the Sue Dong Tong
was settled at a meeting last evening.
The latter tong became satisfied that the
former was not responsible* for the arrest
of. Ah Keons and through the eftort3 of
Police Sergeant Mahoney and squad, who
have charge' or highbinder affairs In Chi
natown, amicable relations were restored.
The cessation . of hostilities in thi.s case
is significant, Inasmuch as it Is one of
those rare occasions where Chinese tong
difficulties have been settled before blood
has been spilled. Sergeant Mahoney met
the tongs, learning that the arrest mado
by his men Wednesday night had been. a
strong incentive to the declaration of war,
and, explaining the circumstances, se
cured the consent of the highbinders that
the woman affair would be settled by ar
bitration. The sergeant explained that
he had arrested Ah Keong about a week
ago and that the courts had restored him
his liberty on condition that he should
depart for Alaska on last Monday. He
failed to keep his promise and when the
police found him mixed up In the assault
on Ah Fong they rearrested him.
SOON TOY POUND.
Hang Hop's Wife Held Captive in a
Clay-Street House.
Soon Toy, the wife of Hang Hop, a
prominent Chinese merchant, has been
located and restored to her home. The
woman was found by the police yester
day in a room on Clay street, where she
was being held captive by two other Chi
nese women. The reward of $100 for her
recovery was paid to a Chinese who oc
cupied an adjoining room and who gave
the information on which the police
worked.
Hang Hop said last night that his wife
had been spirited away by the wife of
Wong King and another woman, for what
purpose he has not yet determined.

Another Great Day for Long Shots.
Ecrtea-well Lake Left the Maiden

The Pacific Union handicap decided at

rather dry contest. It was for three-year
olds, over one mile aÂ«d a furlong. ar.<l
even wr.h IT7 pounds up Advance Guaxd
looked to so outclass Ids field as to de
prive the race of much interest. Messrs.
i'arruthers &. SMolds rornplaint-d of the
heavy impost allotted their colt when the
Â¦weights were nrst issued, still they
teemed quite content with * to 10, and the
luJciit strung theirs "with them.
Of the other seven starters, LJmerick
and ConeteMator were the favored ones,
the play being divided between the pair
far piece honors. At the start Plggott

vorite, and at the first turn was cut oft".
Then; taking the overland route, he had
Limerick beaded as the stretch turn was
reached. With a little waking up, the
r.r^t choice drew away, winning easily.

riding.- tock the place from Constellator.
In making the stretch turn. liggott, on
Advance Uuard, bumped the last named
colt; tvriously impairi:;? his chances. The
stake was worth Si'J'Ai net to the winner.
With a dearth oftiompetent riders, these
arc days for the first choices, long
trhuts apparently having taken complete
possession of the game. Ork>n and the
stake winner were the only winning
ciiuh-es. '
Poorlands. from the stable of Mike Daly,
barked dour, Â¦ from NJ to 20 to 1, came
wiih!'i mi ace of landing the opening
Bcrzusble over the Futurity course.
Johnny Daly had the mount on his
father's horse and, breaking in front of
his company, it was not until the paddock
wa.- reached that Henry got up with the
tavorite Orion, downing the outsider
something over a k-ngth. Aunt Bird
proved a falFe alarm.
After the Screenwell Lake people had
about worn their bankrolls threadbare,
the Artillery (Illy won a race.' She went
to the post at odds of 10 and 15 to 1 for
the two-yoar-old scramble, and in a rat
tling crive with the 1"W to 1 shot Bavassa
earned the verdict by a head. Bernota,
the lirst choice, with Piggott in the sad
file, Wiis unfortunate in being cut off Just
after tha start, ruining her chances. Ross
rode an excellent race on the winner.
Unlucky Kosirante ajrain met with de
feat in the mile ajid a sixteenth selling
affair. The colored la<l Kauntleroy had
the mount, and this fact was responsible
j.o doubt for the Uuctuatlons in the bet
ting. After opening a ti to 5 chance, the
mar< 's odds went to 11 to 5. though she
finally dosed a flight choice over Goto
b(d and Scotch Plaid. It was the same
uM story. Coffey's mare fell out of the
running" during the early stages, then
made a sujtirb effort through the stretch,
reaching the wire In time to be beaten a
length By tJotobvd. astride which Powell
ro<k; a nicely timed race. Scotch Plaid
firms to have gone stale, dropping the
show to Klamero.
Then followed the unexpected downfall
of ili^s Kowena. The fast Burns &
Wat- rhouse sprinter went to the post a
heavily backed; even money chance, and.
afu-r "showing the way well into the
stretch; was UÂ»wled over in hollow fash
ion by the 15 to 1 shot. True Blue, with
Buchanan in the saddle. After a very
stormy passage. Good Hope finished in
the show. The winner carried 93 pounds,
covering the six furlongs in 1:14 flat.
Buchanan sailed home Jirst on the back
of another outsider in the last event, a
Berea furlong run. The ring laid the long
price of 3>) to 1 against Montallade, and
the despised one overhauled and led St.
Cuthbert past the Judges with pounds to
ppare. Lodestar was practically left at
the- post. _____

CAPITALIST BRADBURY
BREAKS LOOSE AGAIN
Defies Board of Public Works and Is
Arrested for Obstructing the.
Sidewalk.
W. B. Bradbury, the millionaire of ex
pectorating fame, has broken loose agnin
by openly defying the Board of Public
Works. He is raising several of his houses
on Van Ness avenue, between California
and Sacramento streets, without securing
the necessary permit, from the board .or
making the necessary deposit of $20.
T. T. Burnett, an employe of the board
notified the contractors of Bradbury's
neglect, and also called at the million
aire's house and left word with the ser
vant. No attention was given the notice
and Burnett called again. The servant
girl said she had told Bradbury, and he
had remarked that he "didn't care a d n
for the Board of Works." He continued
to team across the walk and deposit sand
and gravel on it. and yesterday Burnett
Hwore to a -complaint in Ju<lgÂ« Conlan's
court charging him with obstructing the
sidewalk. He was arrested on the warrant
and gave $20 cash ball for. his release. <

that his cousin, I. A. McMillan, whom he
had not seen for seventeen years, was
staying In the same house. The two men
had frequently met. but had not recog
nized each other. Both approached the
desk at the same timo yesterday and
asked almost in the same breath of the
clerk: "Any mall for McMillan?" The
clerk introduced the two guests and It
required but a few minutes' conversation
to establish their relationship. I. A. Mc-

Concern Operates With

Superintendent Jaynes of the West
ern Union and Charles.Nap
thaly Ask That an Ordi
nance Be Enforced.
The independent messenger companies
recently established by a number of boys
in the downtown district has attracted
tho monopolistic eye of the big corpora
tions that are enpaged in similar- business
on a larger scale and trouble is ahead for
the infantile concerns. The American
District Telegraph Company recently filed
a protest with the Supervisors against the
violation of an 'ordinance by several par
ties in stringing wires*for messenger ser
vice Indiscriminately throughout the city,
whereas the law requires the wires of the
several companies to cross the streets at
a common point.
The subject was deemed Important
enough to necessitate tho presence of Su
perintendent Jaynps of the Western Un
ion Company and Charles Napthaly of the
American District and San Francisco Tel
egraph companies at yesterday's meeting
of the Kire Committee. : Mr. Napthaly
stated that the competition of the boys
was assuming large proportions and was
cutting into the l>if? corporations' profits.
He said the new scheme had been started
by "Uncle Jacob," the pawnbroker, and
the boys of. the old companies were rap
idly going over to tho opposition. He said
that the boys' Â¦ companies had Installed
rush buttons in saloons and were doing a
large amount of business through senti
ment on the part of their customers, and
were, operating without a franchise. He
asked either that similar privileges be
granted hij companies or that' the ordi
nance be upheld. Tho matter was re
ferred to ' Superintendent Hewitt, of the
Fire and Alarm Telegraph, who will rec
ommend what course should bo pursued.

SCAVENGERS CAN ONLY
WORK DURING NIGHTS
Board of Health, and Chief Sullivan
Have Not Yet Selected a "Wagon
Cover.
The Call's crusade against tha scaven
gers who disobey the law by driving
through the streets without a cover on
their wagons is bearing good fruit. Not
only will the scavengers be required to
have a cover on the wagons satisfactory
to the Board of Health and the Chief of
Police, but they must In future perform
their work between the hours of 10 p. m.
and C a- in. The only difficulty In regard
to the new rule ia that it will give scav
engers a better chance to deposit garbage
on vacant lots Instead of taking it to the
crematory. It has been decided, however,
that those arrested for that offense will
be severely punished.
The cases of the scavengers arrested
last week were again called in the Police
Courts yesterday morning, but they were
all continued till April 6, at the request of
Chief Sullivan. . ,
The Board of Health and the Chief have
not yet been able to decide upon a, proper,
covering for the scavenger wagons, but
it is thought that a selection will be made
in a few days. An oilcloth cover seems
to be favored.
SEVERE BLOW TO A
BENEVOLENT ORDER
Golden Gate Lodge of Elks Loses Suit
in the State Supreme
Tha Supreme Court has decided that
Golden Gate Lodge No. 6, Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks of the United
States of America, is not a lawful cor
poration. The action was brought by the
Attorney General two years ago on the
claim of Lewis G. Weatherby that the
lodge was unlawfully. exercising the fran
chise of a corporation , and to enjoin the
members from so doing. Harry NewholT,
T. St. Clair Jones and a dozen others were
named as defendants. In the court below
Judgment went to the defendants. It ap
peared from the findings that prior to De
cember, 1894, the lodge consisted of about
140 members and 40 associate members,
who decided to incorporate, and the neces
sary articles were drawn and subscribed
to by two elective officers of the associa
tion. The Contention that the. lodge had.
no corporate standing was based on sec
tion 292 of the Civil Code, which declares
that articles of Incorporation must be sub
scribed to by five or more persons.
The officers of the lodge contended that
the foregoing applied specially to corpora
tions of a commercial nature, but that the
Elks was purely a social and beneficiary
order.
The Supreme Court says: TWe do not
think that It was the Intent of the Legis
lature that less than five persons could
Incorporate themselves." For these rea
sons the Judgment was reversed, with di
rections to the lower court to enter find-
Ings In favor of the plaintiff.
r> HAHL.ES NEWMAN, proprietor of
J the Richelieu saloon, was at one time
I the owner of fast horses. Some of his
kind friends took the equine record
breakers right out of his hands and New
man has since taken to dogs. He finds the
latter even more expensive than the for
mer, especially one of his most favored
and petted canines, the blue-ribboned
Sam, a bull terrier with all the points dear
to the kennel-crazed fancier.
Up on Post street, near Mason, the
neighborhood in which Newman lives,' the
residents are forming a vigilance commit
tee, the chief purpose of which will be the
sudden termination of Sam's life. A price
has been set upon his head, and like Pud
d'nhead Wilson they are clamoring for
Just half that dog. Since his advent into
the Newman household there has been a
scattering and a disappearance of every
kind of cat known to back yard fences or
parlor rugs. Sam's star performance as
a feline exterminator happened a week
ago, when he mounted the stairs of a
neighboring house and tore off large pieces
of an Angora cat valued at $50. This cat's
nine lives were snuffed out by Sam's su
perb and rapid Jaw work. Of course
Charlie Newman was called upon to sat
isfy the damage done by his pet terrier.
He offered tho lady the sum at which the
ca.fs life was valued. She refused this,
but was placated with a St. Bernard pup
which Charlie Newman in tears says is
worth a cold ?130 if a cent.
This is not the most picturesque char
acteristic of the bull terrier Sam. He Is
not only a cat eater but also a window
smasher. While his owner was saunter-
Ing along Post and Mason streets Wednes
day afternoon the dog spied a cat lnÂ« tho
window of Slack's grocery store. Win
dow or no window, it made no difference
to Sam, who was on the Jump in a min
ute straight through the glass and tangled
up in a pile of broken bottles. He lost
the cat, but made a bill for his owner
that reached $22 50. The dog bled from
head to foot, and his master has been
doctoring him over since. Anybody who
wants a gentle, docile, children-loving but
cat-destroying bull terrier can get one at
Newman's, without caviling over the
price.

AMERICAN LABOR
MENACED BY THE
DELUGE OF JAPS
More Than Three Thousand
Landed Within Fifteen
Months.
Passports; Taken . Out In Japan for
Seven Thousand More Coolies
and the Invasion Is About
| Due.
â â¢ ",
WorMngmen of the United States
In general and of California In particular
are being brought face to face with a
labor problem that Is growing Into colos
sal proportions day by day. That prob
lem, which may become the greatest In
dustrial evil of the country. Is the unre
stricted immigration of Japanese. There
is no exclusion law against this class of
Oriental cheap labor, before the Incur
sions of which even Chinese coolie labor
is retreating, beaten at Its own game of
cheapness.
Information from reliable sources has
reached United States Labor Commis
sioner North at- this port that 7000 pass
ports have been obtained in Japan for
Japanese laborers intending to take pas
sage for the United States. It ordinarily
.requires from nine months to a year for
a laborer to secure a passport, but under
'the new plan of co-operative companies
passports can be obtained with no more
than a week's delay, the laborer paying
10 yen for the accommodation. The con
tract under which he pays this money
provides specifically that In the event that
it should be proven that he has come; to
the United States as a contract laborer
the obligation of the company to guar
antee that the laborer shall not become a
public charge will cease. This proviso
was inserted as a blind.
. The following statement of the number
of Japanese arrivals since January 1, 1599,
will be found interesting: January, 1599.
62 Japanese; February, 94; March, 215;
April, 324; May, 202; June, 196; July, 166;
August. 230; September, 88; October, 104;
November, 45; December, SO; January, 1900,
62; February, 153; March to date, 470. . To
tal, 2491. Add to these 229 coming in by
way of Victoria and about 400 more who
have come in by way of Seattle and the
total swells to 3120 within the short period
of one year and three months.
The Immigration Bureau has been In
formed that 200 Japanese laborers are due
to arrive on the Belgian King next week,
800 on the China oue to-morrow and 400
on the r>oric, due April 7. making an addi
tion of 1400 to the grand total.

/?=0 APTAIN PETER DEMING, the dls
(( gTaced commissary officer under ar
>^^ rest at Alcatraz. will in all prob
ability have to answer to several
charges of forgery and possibly larceny.
Unable to keep up his end with the
moneyed bibbers of the cocktail route, in
an evil moment he stole a checkbook
belonging to the paymaster at the Pre
sidio and proceeded to fill out checks to
suit himeelf. At least a half dozen saloon
men. thinking that the checks were genu
ine, readily cashed them. It is said that
Deming realized a large sum of money
on the worthless paper.
Since his arrival here Deming has been
going the pace that kills. He neglected
his duties at the Presidio to carouse with
habitues of the tenderloin, and at last,
finding himself in dire financial straits,
he resorted to larceny and forgery to con
tinue In the path that leads to the peni
tentiary.
His arrest was brought about by a
Market-street saloonkeeper, whom he
tried to victimize. Accompanied by a
friend, Deming, who was under the in
fluence of liquor, visited his place of busi
ness, and producing a check tor $110. asked
the liquor merchant to cash it. Suspecting
something wrong the saloonkeeper ques
tioned him, and as his answers were not
satisfactory he refused to cash the check.
The following day word was sent to
General Shatter that Deming was spend
ing money with the lavlshness of a mil
lionaire who had suddenly lost his rea
son and he determined to make an in
vestigation. After satisfying himself of
the guilt of Deming Shafter visited police
headquarters and invoked the aid of
Chief Sullivan in arresting the gay cap
tain. The Chief at once detailed two of
his men to find Deming, who was said to
be preparing to leave the city in the
jiope of escaping arrest.
In their investigations the detectives
found that Deming was in the habit of
visiting a notorious house kept by a
woman named Dollle Ogden. The sleuths
kept a watch on the resort, but were
unable to locate Deming. He announced
to the Ogden woman on the occasion of

Mrs. Elizabeth Saunders Will Cele
brate the Eighty-First Anni
versary of Her Birth.
Mrs. Elizabeth Saunders, once a favorite
actress in this city and in the East, will
celebrate the anniversary of her eighty
first birthday at her home, 510 Capp street,
on Wednesday, April 4.
Mrs. Saunders came to California In 1854.
She played with stock companies at the
old California Theater for twenty years
and acted leading parts under many of
the old and famous actors. She was a
favorite with San Francisco theater-goers
and her retirement from the stage* twelve
years ago was an occasion of regret by
all who knew her. In Boston and New
York, where she was on the bills for
seven years, she added laurels to ' her
fame.
Though old and gray, Mrs. Saunders
still retains much or the wit and clever
ness of her younger days. She delights
in recalling reminiscences of her younger
days, and for the purpose of meeting her
old associates she celebrates each anni
versary of her birth and brings them all
around her. . .

FERRIS HARTMAN
THE WHOLE SHOW
"Manila Bound," the Tlvoll's new offer-
Ing. Is difficult of appraisement. It pleases
the audience, which gives audible sign 3
of approval from 8 o'clock until great,
large hours of the night. So did "The
Idol's Eye," and yet there was a defi
ciency of genuine humor In that produc
tion that I quarreled with In the first
week of its extraordinary run. It seems
that a respectable degree of cleverness is
not the main requisite, and if I make the
same charge against "Manila Bound" that
I did against "The Idol's Eye" I may be
correct In the matter of taste but err as
regards the estimation of those Intangible
and unaccountable qualities that some
times make inanity successful.
"Manila Bound" does please the public,
and the public is very welcome. If I
should search for a reason for this pleas
ing power (and it is necessary to search,
for the merits of the piece do not confront
one with a clarity and force that demand
recognition) 1 do not think I would be
amiss in ascribing the evidently taking
quality of the performance to the indus
try of Ferris Hartman.
"Manila Bound" is, I believe, a distor
tion of a European burlesque In which
the element of local satire and trans-
Atlantic humor have been altered (with
an ax) to fit a different envlrdnment. The
vestige of a plot is of no consequence
whatever, but everything is made to de
pend upon the concentrated comedy of
one part. Ferris Hartman has that part,
and he brings to its enactment as much
cheap wit and persiflage as the lines will
accomodate. He Is very amusing in spots,
for he has a tidy collection of jokes that
;irÂ« not old, and taken as a whole his ex
cursion Into German dialect is not a fail
ure. His make-ups are excellent, as such
things go.
I have preached the necessity of careful
preparation in the matter of extravagan
zas and burlesques to the end that the
stupidity with Â¦ which they are usually
loaded may bo illuminated . and place
given to" moderately clever dialogue, of
which a respectable standard should be
sustained throughout such performances.
I have argued against the dumping of
these things on the stage without their
being subjected to a thorough process of
refinement, but with ample opportunity
for just such discriminate care "Manila
Bound" has emerged from the chrysalis
stage with more than Its share of flat
wordiness. Aside from the interpolation
of Hartman there is nothing . said and
little done that will pass muster, and If
in accordance with the method I suggest
all that is unworthy and dull should bo
cast out there would not be enough left
to keep the people from Oakland from
catching the 8:30 boat.
I am afraid that in staging such shows
}Â£Â»t m Â£ na * e Â£?f nt . soes on the principle
o '?^ t0 Â«Â«'"
The golf ballet is pretty, and Mi*s
Frances Graham sings delightfully, but
1t(1 t ( , here l s - nothing else remarkable, unless
It is the success with which Alf Wheelan
characterizes a bore. Ferris Hartman has
mÂ£nSÂ«ft bUr T d , en , t0 carry . and does Itcom^
mendably. If he were just a trifle better
suited for the part I would say that the
show was worth seeing on his account
alone It is in fact, quite interesting to
see him work as hard and as conscien
tiously as ho does.

Charges have been formally filed

cate of the court.
A dispatch from Washington last night
says in reference to Deming's arrest:
"Although the oflicials of the War De
partment are disinclined to discuss the
case of Captain Deming it Is admitted
that his arrest is merely preliminary to I
his trial by court-martial for violations of
the articles of war. His troubles arose
out of an escapade on the Pacific Coast
while en route to Manila for assignment
to duty. It Is stated that while he may
have misappropriated Government funds,
the sum involved is less than $1000 and
is amply secured by his bond of $20,000.
"The gravest feature of his case is an
allegation that he forged the name of
his clerk to pay an account for. $150 and
secured the money and appropriated it
to his own purposes. General Shatter re
ported the matter to the War Department
and was directed to convene a court
martial for the trial of the officer Cap
tain Deming belongs to a highly respect
able family of Buffalo and hitherto has
borne an unblemished reputation. He en
tered the volunteer army at the outbreak
of the fapanlsh war and up to this time
his record has been excellent."
POLICE MAKE RAID ON
PROJECTING SIGNS
Guide Boards Removed in the Night
Cause Complaints and Fun
for the Bluecoats.
Patrolmen have had instructions from
police headquarters during the past two
days, particularly the night watch, to pull
down all business signs that project over
the sidewalk contrary to the ordinance
regulating such matters. The first raid
was made on Tuesday night, when several
hundred signs were torn down and carted
out to the General Station, where they
were packed away in the property-room.
Yesterday many sign-owners, perfectly
unconscious of the manner in which their
signs had been removed, called at the po
lice station and entered complaint In re
gard to the disappearance of their prop
erty.
"Are you quite sure that you could iden
tify your sign If it were found?" inquired
the desk sergeant of the first complainant.
"Why, in a minute." was the reply.
The victim was then led into the prop
erty-room and requested to pick out his
sign from the big pile stacked up there.
The result was always amusing, particu
larly as the sign owner's discomfiture was
usually witnessed by a crowd of grinning;
spectators.
The work of removing signs went mer
rily, on last night. Merchants can save
themselves much trouble by taking the
obnoxious signs down themselves, and
also save cartage bills from the Central
Police Station.
TRIED TO FORCE
INSOLVENCY ON
WILLIAM THIRD
E. J. and 0. J. Bamberger
Scored in the Report of
a Referee.
. Insolvency proceedings against Wil
liam Third commenced in the United
States District Court are likely to come
to. a sudden conclusion, for by the report
of the referee, Milton J. Green, Third was
unjustly forced into the courts by O. J.
Bamberger, who attempted to use that
method to collect a note for $200 given him
by Third for alleged legal services.
Third had two dry goods "stores â one at
920 Valencia street and the other at 2013
Fillmore street. He had assets to the
amount of $20,000 and liabilities amount
ing to between $13,000 and $14,000. His
creditors were pressing him and he called
upon Bamberger to place In his hands a
claim for collection. According to the
findings of the referee. Third told Bam
berger that his creditors were pressing
him, and Bamberger. after representing
himself and the firm of E. J. and O. J.
Bamberger to be the attorneys for the
Bank or Commerce of San Francisco,
agreed to advise Third as a means of
escape from his financial difficulties.
He advised Third to convey the Valen
cia-street store to Florence Lavlne. who
was then Its manager, she to take up all
Its debts and to open an account with
the Bank of Commerce. He also agreed
to secure the consent of the other cred
itors to such an arrangement. For this
piece of advice Bamberger charged Third
$200, for which Third gave a note.
In the meantime there was a hitch in
the transfer of the Valencia-street store,
for Murphy, Grant & Co., one of the
creditors, objected, so Instead both
stores were sold to Charles R. Havens,
who was In the employ of Murphy, Grant
& Co., conditionally, however, and for
the pole purpose of ascertaining how the
business was prospering and how it was
being carried on. Bamberger at that
time admitted that the assignment to
Florence Lavine was void.
The findings further set tpnn that then
Bamberger secured the elnftons of several
of the creditors of Third, and with these
and his own note of $200 he brought pro
ceedings of Insolvency against Third,
claiming that he had assigned his busi
ness to Havens for the benefit of his cred
itors. None of the larger creditors wished
the proceedings brought and steps were
taken to have them dismissed, but Bam
berger refused to have them dismissed
unless his own claim and the other claims
he held were paid In full. This the other
creditors refused to allow, and so the pro
ceedings were followed up.
By the findings, however. It 13 declared
that the proceedings brought by Bam
berger are against the best Interests of
Third and for the purpose of forcing the
collection of the note for $200, and have
therefore been prosecuted In bad faith.
It is further found that neither E. J. nor
O. J. Bamberger are attorneya-at-law, nor
is Third Insolvent.
The court will probably make an order
in conformity with these finding?, and
Third will be allowed to resume his bust
ness, which by the term 3 of the findings
seemed at no time to be In danger.
man car in which Collins and his escort
were riding the latter were found to be
missing. The porter of the car was asked
where they had g^e, bu t he professed
ignorance as to theTr whereabouts.
It was only by information obtained
from one of the trainmen that the officers
from Washington and their prisoner were
finally located. When this information
had been imparted to the local officers
they had the porter open the smoker in
the Pullman car, where they found the
men they were so earnestly looking for.
Sheriff Johnson read to the Washington
officers the writ of habeas corpus com
manding that the body of Collins be pro
duced in Judge Lawlor's court in San
Francisco at a specified time, and also
served upon them the warrant charging
them with kidnaping.
While the officers were searching for
the men Deputy Sheriff Troy of San Fran
cisco frequently called out Collins by
name, so loud that he must have heard
Troy unless he was asleep, which proved
not to be the case. Collins did not answer
to his name.
The agents of the State of Washington
aaid after the papers had been served that
Collins preferred to be taken back to
Seattle rather than remain in San Fran
cisco, because he had about $400 in San
Francisco and that the legal sharks in
that city were anxious to secure a portion
or all of the money. The fact that Col
lins did not respond when Troy shouted
his name a number of times while search
ing through the car in a measure bears
out the statement that Collins preferred
to be taken to Seattle rather than be
taken back to San Francisco. The writ
of habeas corpus and the warrants charg
ing the Washington officers with kidnap
ing were'telegraphed to this city and were
delivered to Sheriff Johnson shortly after
the arrival of the train.

CONGRESSIONAL
BATTLE IN THE
FIRST DISTRICT
Frank L. Coombs Is a Can
didate for the Republican
Nomination.
Sonoma, Humboidt, Napa and Men-
docino Present Favorite Sons.
John A. Sarham Does Not
Ask to Be Re-elected.
The Call Is authorized to make the defi
nite announcement that Frank L. Coombs
is In the field as a candidate fc, the
Republican Congressional nomination
in the First District. Intelligence
having been received by wire from
several towns in the district to the
effect that Mr. Coombs was considered
as a probable candidate, but that no
direct statement had been made that his
named would be placed before the conven
tion. The Call deemed it advisable to ask
him if the reports of his candidacy were
correct. He said it had been represented
to him by many prominent Republicans
of the district that he could be elected if
he received the tr.Jorsement of the Re
publican cor.vention. He remarked fur
ther that his friends seemed to be con!l
<Jent that he could secure the nomination
and were anxious to begin active work in
his behalf. Mr. Coombs said that he had
given the subject careful consideration
and had decided to become a candidate.
It Is probable that the list of Republi
can entries for the race In the First Dis
trict is complete. No doubt Senator Gil
lette, who made a splendid record in the
Legislature and who is a man of high
character and superior ability, will go to
the convention sustained by a united dele
gation from Humboidt County and will
rally to his support delegates from other
counties. District Attorney Webber of
Sonoma County has been In the field as a
candidate for several months and has
visited many counties of the district. He
teems to L>e confident that he will secure
the nomination. He is positive that he
will receive the undivided support of the
Sonoma delegation, which is the largest
single delegation In ihi district. Rumors
reach The Call that D. E. McKinlay, the
Republican campaign orator, will finÂ«l in
the Sonoma delegation a number of warm
pupporters. He may develop more
strengrh as r candidate to succeed Mr.
Barham than many of the other aspirants
now surmise.
Thomas Carothers of UTriah is listed as
a candidate to represent the district in
Cougrfss. and it may be regarded as a
sure thing that the united support of the
big delegation from Mer.docino County
will be lined up In his txshalf. He has
rendered the party valuable services in
many a hotly contested campaign. Hia
friends in the district are legion.
Frank Coombs will go to the conven
tion with the enthusiastic and ardent sup
port of the solid delegation from Napa
County. His friends assure him that he
will receive aid and comfort from many
other counties. He has served the party
in the Legislature, on the floor of the As
sembly and as Speaker of that body. He
represented the I'nited States as Minis
ter to Japan and served creditably in that
capacity. He Is now holding the position
of United States District Attorney. He
came close to the nomination for Gover
nor the second time that Estee was nomi
nated.
All the aspirants In the Republican fold
have received positive assurance that tha
present representative, John A. Baxham,
will not again apply for renominatlon.
The contest In the district is an open one.
No candidate has a mortgage on the posi
tion. Delegates to the nominating con
vention will be chosen on the second
Tuesday of August, according to the pro
visions of the primary election law. The
delegate* rnav decide to hold the conven
tion in San Francisco, or they may as
semble at Sacramento and adjourn to
meet at some point within the district.
The selection of delegates to represent
the First Congressional District in the
Republican National Convention called
to assemble at Philadelphia on June 19
will be entirely separate and apart from
the Congressional contest in the district.
Neither can the delegates to the State
convention, to assemble In May for the
purpose of choosing delegates to represent
this State at large in the national con
vention, participate in the Congressional
nomination.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 1900.
COLLINS MAKES
A STRUGGLE FOR
HIS FREEDOM
Seattle Robber Is Smuggled
Out of City Prison by
the Officers.
Prisoner and Custodians Taken From
Train at Sacramento and the
Latter Placed Under Ar
rest for Kidnaping.
â¢
John F. Collins, alias Harper, alias Mur
phy, bank robber and all around crook, is
now on his way to Seattle for his partici
pation in the theft of a roll of greenbacks
from the First National Bank of that city.
In order to circumvent his attorney,
George D. Collins, from preventing him
from being taken back to the scene of his
bold crime, Chief of Police Sullivan, after
a consultation with Captain Seymour and
Inspector Venotto of the Pinkerton De
tective Agency, effected a coup d'etat by
which the desperate prisoner was not
only removed from the City Prison un
known to his counsel but was shortly
afterward placed aboard the Oregon ex
press, bound for Seattle.
He was accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
McLeod of Seattle and a detective. The
prisoner was heavily ironed, as it was
feared that he would make a desperate
attempt to escape from his captors.
Yesterday morning the officers arrived
from Seattle ready to take the bank rob
ber back to the scene of his crime. They
were armed with a warrant signed by the
Governor of the State of Washington and
charging Collins with grand larceny in
robbing the First National Bank' of that
city.
When arrested by Detectives Ryan and
ODea, the clever sleuths of the southern
station, Collins was not booked, as the
police were anxious to hear from the Se
attle authorities before placing a charge
against him. Determined to resist any
attempt to have him taken back to Seat
tle, the prisoner sent lor Attorney Col
lins and retained him to defend him.
Learning that Collins intended to sue out
a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of his
client, Ryan and ODea, after a consulta
tion with Chief of Police Sullivan, booked
the daring criminal for a crime committed
in this cily some time ago.
Collins had committed several bold rob
beries, and by order of Captain Spillane
Kyan and O"i)ta were detailed to arrest
Landed in Prison-
After considerable trouble they finally
located him with the assistance of Ser
geant Tom Ellis and charged him with the
crime of grand larceny in stealing a pack
age of money from the safe in Morse
head's stables on Clay street. While his
preliminary examination was proceeding
in Judge Low's court Collins cut his way
out of the dock and made his escape.
On learning that the officers from^ Seat
tle had arrived here, prepared to take the
prisoner back. Attorney Collins sued out
a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of his
client, setting forth that the bank robber
was being illegally deprived of his lib
erty. The writ was made returnable be
fore Judge Murasky at 5 o'clock last even
ing, at which time Collins was produced
in court. He was guarded by Detectives
Ryan and ODea and Sergeant Ellis.
Chief of Police Sullivan, Captain Sey
mour and the Pinkerton inspector were
present to see that Collins did not attempt
to get away. The Seattle officers also oc
cupied seats in the courtroom.
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey ap
peared for the Chief of Police and George
D. Collins for the prisoner. Deuprey first
addressed the court. He reviewed the
case against Collins and asked that he bÂ«j
remanded to the custody of Chief Sulli
van. Attorney Collins argued that inas
much as Judge Low's court went out of
existence immediately after the adoption
of the new charter the prisoner could not
be held on a warrant issued from that
tribunal. Judge Murasky held that the
point was well taken and ordered that
Collins be given his liberty. As the de
tectives heard the decision they arose
from their seats as if intending to rear
rest the bank robber. Attorney Collins,
noticing their action, addressed the court
and asked that an order be Issued pre
venting the police from interfering with
his namesake. This Judge Murasky re
fused to do.
Bearrested in Court.
As the Judge stepped into his private
chambers Captain Seymour directed Ryan
and ODea to handcuff the prisoner and
take him below to the city bastile. Col
lins at once became ugly and half arose
from his chair as if he intended to break
through the cordon of officers. His at
torney whispered to him, which had the
effect of quieting the desperate man. As
the two detectives started to handcuff
him Attorney Collins asked them to wait
as he wanted to draw up a petition for
another writ and which he wanted Collins
to sign. After finishing writing the peti
tion the attorney had Collins sign it. It
was then sworn to before a Deputy
County Clerk, who had been summoned
for ' that purpose. The irons were then
placed on the prisoner's wrists.
On the way to the City Prison he
threatened to "smash" Detective Ryan's
nose, and declared that he would never be
taken back to Seattle alive.
Smuggled Out of Prison.
After reaching the prison Collins was
formally booked for the Seattle bank job
on a warrant issued by the Governor of
Washington. Rather than take any
further chances of losing their man Chief
Sullivan, after a conversation with Cap
tain Seymour and the Pinkerton inspector,
decided to turn him over to the Seattle
officers.
Collins was then hurriedly placed in the
patrol wagon, and accompanied by Ryan
and ODea, the two Seattle officers and
Police Officer A*att Tierney. he was driven
to the ferry. Seeing that he was up
against' lt Collins showed a disposition to
give the officers battle, but he soon
changed his mind on being told that his
first hostile demonstration would result
In his body being sent to the Morgue.
After crossing the bay the officers took
Collins into the back room of a restaurant
and held him there until a few minutes
before the train left. *
He was then put aboard the train, after
an extra pair of irons had been placed on
his legs. - ' .
On hearing of the action of the police
in smuggling Collins out of the City
Prison the attorney of the same name
went before Judge Lawlor and sued out
a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the
Chief of Police and the Seattle officers to
produce the bank robber in court at 10
o'clock this morning. The writ was given
to the Sheriff to serve, and accompanied
by the attorney he vainly searched for
the man against whom it was directed.
Collins, on learning that the prisoner was
on his way back to Seattle, wired the
various Chiefs of Police along the route
to hold his namesake and the Seattle
officers. He threatens that unless Collins
is returned to the City Prison within
twenty-four hours he will have Chief Sul
livan, Captain Seymour and Detectives
Ryan and ODea arrested for kidnaping.

DISGUSTED BIMETALLISTS.
BRITISH bimetallists, who ever since the big
vote cast for Bryan in 1896 have been hoping
that through some perversity of the American
people the free silver champion might be elected this
fall, have now .fallen into the deeps of despondency.
They have come to the conclusion that Bryan has
abandoned the silver cause and is going to make his
contest this year on altogether different grounds.
The London National Review is the principal or
gan of the British silver men, and for the purpose
of keeping its readers posted on the chances of bi
metallism in this country it maintains at Washington
City a correspondent, Moreton C. Bradley, who
every month contributes an extensive article on
American affairs. That gentleman has of late become
disgusted, and in the current number of the Review
mourns over the fall of. Bryan. .
In the course of his article Mr. Bradley says: "The
Democrats have really abandoned the silver issue and
are concentrating all their efforts on anti-expansion.
As Mr. Bryan is conceded to be the Democratic
nominee, he cannot stultify himself by admitting there
is nothing in the cry of free silver, and that when in
1896 he offered silver as a panacea for all ills he was
trying to foist off upon the public a quack remedy.
For the sake of consistency he still touts silver, but
it is one of the most significant signs of the times
that Mr. Bryan says less about silver and more about
imperialism; free trade he no more mentions, but
on trusts he is strong and eloquent."
Commenting upon this statement from the Wash
ington correspondent, the editor of the Review says:
"English bimetallists have watched the career of Mr.
Bryan (who so nearly obtained the Presidency of
the United States in 1896) with interest and admira
tion. He seemed to be a strong, capable and indepen
dent man, entirely devoted to the cause with which
his name and fame are associated, and looking neither
to the right nor the left, but keeping his eye riveted
on the goal. Apart from this personal regard we
"have a political stake in his fortunes. A strong silver
party in the United States is vital to the victory of
bimetallism, whether it be achieved by that, country
single-handed or by a combination of countries. We
are among those who believe that if the American
people have sufficient moral courage they can settle
this great question once and for all, but we doubt
whether Democracy is sufficiently powerful to cope
with plutocracy. Mr. Bryan appears to share this
doubt. For how' can his present pro-Boer agitation
be explained unless it be intended to cover a strate
gic withdrawal on the silver question?"
Thus the British backers of Mr. Bryan, who hoped
that through : him the people of the United States
would undertake to make, fifty cents' worth of silver
bullion pass current as a dollar, have lost faith in him.
Their admiration is gone, and what they most mourn
for, their "political stake in his fortunes," has gone
with it. They now perceive that their favorite is no
more than a demagogue using any cause that seems
popular as a means of advancing himself, and their
disgust is deep. /
EVEN on land, forty miles an hour Is a high speed. Not
many years ago it was the test record of our fastest ex
presses. That it should be accomplished by a boat seems
well nigh incredible. Yet it has been done by the new
British torpedo-boat destroyer Viper, equipped with the Par
sons steam turbines instead of ordinary engines. The first boat
of this type, the Turbinia. created a sensation at a naval review
two or three years ago by reason of her phenomenal speed; but
the Viper^s more than. twice as large as her predecessor, the
principal dimensions being: Length 210 feet, beam 21 feet, dis
placement 350 tons. The indicated horsepower is about 11,000.
The writer of a brief notice In Industries and Iron (London,
February 16) says of the vessel:
"The most nbtlceable feature in a boat engined with Par
sons' turbines Is the entire absence of vibration, which enables
guns to be trained much more accurately than when reclpro-
eating engines are used. Other advantages which will appeal
more directly to engineers are the facts that turbine engines
take up considerably less space, consume less coal per horse
power, require less care and attention when running and are
cheaper in first cost than ordinary engines.
"The turbine engines of the Viper are similar to those of
Goes Forty Miles an Hour Through the Water.
CALIFORNIA LAND SURVEYS.
AT the recent session of the Legislature there was
enacted a joint resolution which, after reciting
the wide difference in the progress made by the
officials of the Federal Government in surveying pub
lic lands in* California and that made elsewhere, and
directing attention to the importance of such surveys,
instructs the Senators and requests the Representa
tives of the State of Washington to urge the comple
tion of the public surveys in California and prompt
filing of plats in local land offices, to the! end that the
public lands be made available for settlement and im
provement.
The facts of the case are such as *o render it impera
tive that our Congressmen inquire into the matter.
Statistics published in The Call yesterday show that
during the year 1889 the amount added to the surveyed
area of public land in this State was only 8387 acres,
but during the same year there were added to the sur
veyed public lands in Arizona, ft 02,658 acres; Colo
rado, 145,213: Idaho, 788,503; Minnesota, 99.021; Mon
tana. 1,893,662; Nebraska, 8057; Nevada, 136,545; Ne\V
Mexico, 342.406; North Dakota. 2,259,095; Oregon,
382,175; South Dakota, * 1,720,404; Utah, 621,174;
Washington, 637,636; Wyoming, 697,449.
A mere cursory reading of the figures shows there
lias been a vast discrimination against. California in
the work of opening public lands for settlement. The
figures, however, do not tell the whole story. In
other States and Territories where there are public
lands there are Land Commissioners or Assistant
Commissioners having charge of the work of sur
veying. In California there is no such officer and con
sequently when surveys have been made here the plats
must be sent to the General Land Office at Washing
ton for approval before they are filed with the local
land offices.
There may be good reasons why these differences
exist between the system of land surveying which the
Government applies to California and that which pre
vails elsewhere, but the reasons are not apparent on
the face of the facts. It is therefore the duty of our
Congressmen to inquire into the matter and find out
if some remedy cannot be found for a condition of
affairs that amounts to a serious evil. The interests
and the welfare of the nation will be served as well by
the settlement of the public lands in California as by
the settlement of such lands in other localities and
something other than public considerations is there
fore likely to be among the reasons why this State is
treated differently from others. Investigation may
therefore result in the discovery of an abuse which the
Government will be prompt to check.
THE DEAD LION OF AFRICA.
JOUBERT, the strong lion of the Dark Conti
nent, is dead. He was born of a family that set
tled in Africa two hundred and fourteen years
ago. What education he had was self-gained and his
military skill was inherent. It is interesting to see
through his lineage and career the close analogy be
tween the Boers and our own ancestors, the men and
commanders of the American revolution. The families
of nearly all the officers and soldiers of that revolution
had been domesticated on this continent more than
one hundred and fifty years. The Boers, like them,
had learned military tactics in the native wars.
Joubert organised the farmers of the Transvaal into
a quick-moving and hard-striking military force, al
most exactly on the lines of the "minute men" of New-
England, who did the first fighting at Lexington and
Concord and at Bunker Hill. We may see his ana
logue in our history, in Putnam, Knox, Ethan Allen,
Greene, Anthony Wayne, George Rogers Clark,
Sumpter and Francis Marion.
In the flush of his powers and the prime of his
years it is doubtful if any cotemporary soldier in
Europe could excel him under conditions of equality
as to armament and resources. His battles were all
fought against odds. At Majuba Hill he was outnum-
bered more than three to one and so through the
whole series of engagements in which his tactics were
used and his spirit inspired the armies of his country.
England understood perfectly the necessity for put
ting in the field in her present campaign ten soldiers
to Joubert's one and ten guns to his one in order to
overwhelm him. In all the history of warfare it has
not before occurred that a commander, isolated from
the sea, with difficulties and distance on all sides, un
der every possible discouragement and disadvantage,
with no substantial help from the strong nations and
enjoying only the covert sympathy of the weak, has
so trained his people, armed them, fortified his
Strategic points and presented them in such form. that
the world's greatest empire is compelled to count ten
of its soldiers only equal to one of his! Now that this
captain of his countrymen, this- watchful lion of the
veldt and kopje^ is dead, one can wish that the British
authorities had omitted the slander and defamation
with which they covered his fame while he was mak
ing his last fight, not against them, but an enemy that
they cannot outnumber. The Boer general, who will
rank with the world's great captains, was charged
by the British correspondents with cowardice and it
was published that his countrymen were about to put
him to death. But the grim old fighter stayed on the
field, in service, at his duty, planning the defenses of
his country to the last possible hour and only reached
his pillow in time to lay_ off his war harness and put
on immortality.
Every good heart in the wide world aches with the
Boer heart in this bereavement of a nation. It is one
of the inscrutable tragedies of life and of history.
His name held the outnumbering enemy at bay. Lord
Roberts, with the military resources of an empire at
command, had planned to lie in safe Bloemfontein
and wait for reinforcements, for the addition of men
and guns to his existing preponderance of ten to one,
hefore moving forward to meet General. Joubert's
forces. But the dirge that sounds for Joubert is
jangled by the charge forward, blown by the British
bugles. The soldier who made one of his country
men worth ten of the enemy will make war no more
and the invader feels safe in moving forward. But
outside of the sordid empire, where Ahab and Jezebel
lust for the vineyard of Naboth, the whole world
stands uncovered in respectful ascription to the mem
ory of Joubert, the soldier, patriot and Christian gen
tleman, the greatest of the Africans.

THE ACTIVITY OF RUSSIA.
r~i CCORDING to reports from Europe, the Rus-
I V sians have swung away from the Czar's aspira
* tions for peace and are now undertaking mili
tary movements upon a scale of almost unparalleled
magnitude. Not content with crushing the ancient
liberties of Finland on their northwestern frontier and
encroaching upon China in the extreme East, they are
said to be menacing the frontier of India, establishing
something like domination in Persia and demanding .
of the Sultan concessions which will give them a para
mount influence in Asia Minor.
The very magnitude of these reported enterprises
casts suspicion upon the accuracy of the reports. It is
hardly credible that any Government would enter
upon a policy of aggrandizement which will rouse so
many formidable antagonists at once. In Finland, in
deed, Russia has been allowed a free hand and may
have the same freedom from restraint in setting up
domination over Persia, but at every other point
where her armies are said to be massing there are
certain to be foes, either one of whom is sufficiently
powerful to compel respect. Over the Indian fron
tier Great Britain stands guard. Germany, with her
important railway concessions in Syria, will not read
ily permit Russia to control the regions through which
the roads are to run, while for the defense of Korea
Japan is ready to fight and will doubtless have the
backing of Germany and Great Britain.
A recent dispatch from Berlin stated the German
Government would preserve a strict neutrality between
the Russians and the Turks in the controversy over
the Syrian railways. It is to be noted, however, that
the German press has been outspoken in its manifesta
tions of a desire that German interests there be care
fully guarded and there is moreover a good deal of
significance in the statement of Count yon Bulow in
the Reichstag on Tuesday that there have been
marked changes in the political conditions of Europe
since 1808 and that an enlarged navy is now more
necessary to Germany than ever.
With such antagonism confronting Russia at three
points of her reported aggressions it is hajdly likely
that her statesmen will push them to the extent of
war in either case. Russia is not yet ready to fight
Japan for the possession of Korea and domination over
the Asiatic side of the North Pacific Ocean. , She may
undertake that war when the Siberian Railway is com
pleted, but she will not force it before that time.
Neither is it at all probable that with her railway
projects in Central Asia on hand she will venture to
rouse Great Britain, while any aggressions in Syria
that would compel the. Germans to take up the cause
of the Sultan would be a folly of the greatest magni
tude.
Russia is always advancing. "She has all Asia for a
field and has been extending her dominion over the
wild tribes and desolations of the vast regions' of that
continent for more than a hundred years. She will
eventually dominate all of it that does not pass under
the control and have the protection of some great
civilized power. The nations, however, are watching
her and two of themâ Germany and Great Britain
have Asiatic ambitions as well as herself. Common
prudence on the part of her statesmen will dictate that
she avoid a contest with both of them at once and

THE EXPERIENCE OF GLASGOW.
THE paper read to the Berkeley Club last year by
Mr. Robert Watt, which The Call published
yesterday, is a very timely and most valuable
contribution to the discussion of public ownership of
public utilities. The time of its delivery and the body
before which it was read join to separate it from the
semi-partisan controversy which will soon occur upon
the question which it discusses and make it rather
an authority that may be safely resorted to for the
facts, upon which all must rely who desire to be
euided by experience.
Mr. Watt makes it plain that we must segregate
%2ter supplies and their cost, classifying them ac
cording to the extent to which the clouds share in
the storage and evaporation in the consumption of

Virginia, 40: Wisconsin, 34; Wyoming, 12.
These figures divide the arid from the moist re
gion very sharply. Arizona with 13 inches, Califor
nia with 21, Colorado 20, Dakota 21, Idaho 16, Mon
tana 13, Nevada ii, New Mexico 13. Utah 16 and
Wyoming with 12 inches of rain annually and a mean
for the entire group of 15 inches annually, present
conditions of water supply that are widely different
from thos* found in regions not only of greater rain
fall, but where it is not limited to a fixed rainy season,
but is distributed throughout the year.
Added to this low rate of precipitation we must
estimate the evaporation during the dry season and
when we apply to water storage the two factors of low
rainfall and high evaporation we find a problem of
supply totally different from that presented in the
perpetually moist parts of the earth like Glasgow and
the cities of this country east of the Missouri River.
The mean of the world and of the United States be
ing 36 inches and of the British isles 44 inches, we
must see at once that allowance must be made- for
the great difference between those means and one of
15 inches, more than one-half less than the mean of
the wor!d and the United States, and but little exceed
ing a third of the mean of the British isles.
If these physical conditions, so vividly suggested by
Mr. Watt's paper, are studied,- they will materially
modify some extravagant expectations that people
are in the habit of having regarding public owner
fhip.
HAVANA, March 26. 1900.
râ¢*\RLY In May there is to be held in
I Cuba a general election. It is to
1^ be the first effort at general self-
government of the Cuban people.
A Mayor and Common Council are
to be elected in each of the cities
of the island, and on .these is to de
volve the duty of electing delegates to a
convention which is to De charged with
the Important duty of framing a national
constitution. There are to be twenty dele
gates from each of the five provinces,
making 100 in all, and there is a growing
agitation over this impending political
event. &VÂ£?2Ji l 'Â£'&
The rights of suffrage have been rough
ly fixed by the United States authorities
for this Initiative in the founding of a
nation. Every Cuban who can read and
write, who owns land or has other prop
erty of the value of $250, or who was a
soldier In the Cuban army, is to be al
lowed to vote. The Spaniards occupy a
rather uncomfortable position. By- royal
decree of their sovereign' they have been
required to register If they desire to re
tain allegiance to Spain. The limit for
registration is April 10, after which time
those who fail to register may have the
legal status of citizens of Cuba, unless an
Inhibition is placed upon them by the new
constitution. Evidently some fear of that
outcome Is felt, as it is estimated that at
least two-thirds of the Spanish subjects
are registering their Intention of main
taining their allegiance. '
As comprehensive as these conditions
are they do not suit the Cuban leaders.
In the impatience of these head men in
this matter a fair reflex of the Cuban
character is afforded. Their impatience
at the slow process that places them in
power is manifest in every move that. they
make. They cannot contain themselves
until such time as they shall come in full
and unbridled control of things. Meet-
Ings are held almost every day and night,
at which the burden of the cry is for uni
versal suffrage. At a meeting of the Cu
ban National party last night, over which
Alejandro Rodriguez presided and Gon-
Â¦ Â¦ _ Â¦-, -.r-.. -â¢-.â¢â¢.Â¦â¢...

zalo Perez acted as secretary, it was im
pressed upon all present that nothing
short of universal suffrage would do. The
discussion Is always fiery at these politi
cal meetings. It is more of the nature of
that which precedes and leads up to a
revolution than of that which is the pre
cursor of a peaceful organization of a new
republic.
The reason for this desire for universal
suffrage is well understood here. The Cu
ban leaders fear that with the ballot re
stricted even to the limited extent pro
posed it will be In such responsible hands
that they may experience trouble in re
taining control. They want the rag-tag
to vote â the off-scourings of all classes
and shades: and nobody can form an Idea
of the unfitness of. this element to exer
cise suffrage unless he is on the ground.
There may be some high-minded Cubans
among those in the lead who are actu
ated by genuinely patriotic motives in
standing out for universal suffrage, but I
have not been able .from quite extended
inquiry to satisfy myself of that fact.
Their whole purpose seems to be to get
control of the government at the earliest
possible moment.
The Cubans now prominent In affairs are
largely those who composed the Juntas In
the li nited States and elsewhere during
the warâ who maintained the bureaus of
publicity and exerted themselves to create
public sentiment in the United States. The
fighting was done mostly by, negroes, and
it is a marvel to. those who are able now
to size up the revolution how the handful
of ragamuffins and outcasts that were
marshaled as the Cuban army were able
to'maintaln any organization, or even to
escape annihilation long before interven
tion was provoked. It must have been
wholly due to that marvelous. Incapacity
cf the Spanish authorities that In the war
with the United States astounded the
modern world. When evacuation was ef
fected nearly 50,000 soldiers embarked for
Spain at the port of Havana alone. When
the war ended there must have been up
wards of ICO.OOO in the island.
The work Is proceeding at departmental
headquarters of preparing for this forth
coming election. There is a great amount
of detail to be arranged. The date has
not been positively set yet. but it Is ex
pected that it will be May 10. Evea the
CUBANS PREPARING TO FOUND
A NEW NATION AT THE POLLS
conditions of the franchise may bÂ« re
vised. The purpose is to afford the great
est latitude compatible with safety. While
the Cubans expect to be given full sweep
very soon after the election Is held, the
United States authorities take frequent
occasion to declare that the election is
experimental. It is plain enough that there
is a desire to see how the experiment will
work, and that added power will not at
once be placed in the hands of the Cubans
unless they demonstrate their capacity to
use this wisely.
â¢ It is believed by some that the elections
will be the occasion for much disturbance
and rioting. The natural bent of the Cu
ban to turbulence is some warrant for
such prediction, but until the terms and
conditions of the franchise are fixed it is
difficult to say what is likely to take place.
It is felt, however, that if any consider
able element is disfranchised, either di
rectly or indirectly, outbreaks are very
likely to occur.
While everybody takes It for granted
that the United States forces are finally to
withdraw, in accordance with the declared
policy of the Government, nobody experts
the troops to be removed for a consider
able time, even after a constitution is got
into working order. Plenty of time is sure
to be taken to see how any effort and all
efforts at self-government will work. The
T United States forces now command the
situation. Though they effected Cuban
independence, they are loved scarcely
more by the Cubans than were the Span
iards. Should the United States withdraw
prematurely, and should anything happen
that would make Intervention again neces
sary, the island would have to be recon
quered. The scenes of Santiago would
have to be re-enacted, either there or
elsewhere, for It is perfectly understood
that the Cubans, once they have sway,
will give no heed to advice or admonition
from the United States. Cuba will be an
unruly and lawless child, to be watched
over and even protected in her quarrels,
but not subject to reproof and not to be
guided so as to avoid the dangers and pit
falls which the headstronar and heedless
are prone to fall Into. The problem in
Cuba is a, greater one than the* American
nation as yet appreciates.

the Turbinia, but in duplicate, and consist of two distinct sets.
one on each side of the vessel. There are four screw shafts In
all, entirely independent of one another, the two shafts on one
side being driven by one high anil one low pressure turbine re
spectively. The two low-pressure turbines drive the inner
'shafts, and to each of these shafts a small reversing turbine Is
also permanently coupled and revolves idly with the shaft when
going ahead. These reversing turbines provide sufficient power
to drive the vessel astern at a speed of 15 knots. The screw
shafts are carried by brackets as usual; and two propellers are
placed on each shaft, the foremost in each case having a
â¢ slightly lesser pitch than the after one. There are thus eight
propellers in all. The thrust from the screw shafts is entirely
balanced by the steam acting on the turbine, so that there Is
extremely little friction.
.â¢ . * "The boilers, auxiliary machinery and condensers arÂ© of
the type usual in such vessels, but their size is somewhat In
creased to meet the much larger horsepower to be developed.
This compensates for the lesser weight of the main engines,
shafting, propellers, as well as the lighter structure of tha
engine beds. The boilers are of the Yarrow type, and the hull
and all fittings are of. the usual design."
The Republicans of Alameda are greatly exercised
over the election of a delegate at large to the national
convention. This is justified by'the fact probably that
there is a natural desire on the part of citizens to
attend what will be perhaps the greatest ratification
meeting in the history of the ; nation!'^

6that part of the film that has been acted
upon by light to turn dark. The sulphite
of soda Is known, as the . "clearing solu
tion." This controls the color In the nega
tive. By .varying the strength of these
chemicals in the developer to be used on
the different exposures different effects
can be obtained. For Instance, suppose it
is known that the plate is undertimed.
more of the carbonate of potassium should
be added, while if the plate is overtimed
more of the pyrogallic acid should be
useo." ,If the negative shows too much
yellow In it there should be more of the
sulphite of soda used. If the negative has
a black or blue-black color too much sul
phite of soda has been used. The best
color for the negative is generally thought
to be a faint tinge of yellowish-green.
>ow that It Is understood what action the
different chemicals have on the film the
developing may be proceeded with.
Place the plate in the tray, film side up.
Grasp the tray with the left hand. Take
the developer In the right hand and Row
it over the plate quickly. Do not do this
roughly, as that would cause air bells,
which would settle on the film and cause
} transparent spots. It is rather a hard
J matter to understand Just when a negative
should first begin to show the image, and
a still harder one to tell when It la fin
ished. However, to make things as simple
as possible it Is suggested that when the
plate has been in the developer from
twenty-four to thirty seconds the imagÂ»
should begin to show in the strongest high
lights. This is what may be called a nor
mally timed negative. If. however, the
high lights fall to appear inside thirty sec
onds It may be considered an undertimed
plate and should be treated accordingly.
First a few drops of the carbonate of
potassium from the stock solution bottte
should be added to the developer. If the
plate 1s not too much undertimed this may
suffice.. If thia, however, falls to bring It
all right make up a fresh developer, using
about twice the amount of water and
about one-third more of the carbonate of
poiasslum. Pour this over the plate and
cover the tray and l<Â»t It sit for some time.
"When the shadows begin to show the
detail pour off this solution and pour on
normal developer and finish the develop
ment. If. on the other hand, the plate
shows In less than twenty-four seconds
the plate should be treated for overtime.
If it is only slightly overtimeâ say It
shows in about eighteen or twenty sec
ondsâa few drops of pyrogallic acid solu
tion will usually make it all right. If it
should be considerably overtimed, say It
should show in ten seconds, the proper
treatment would be to use a few drops of
a 10 per cent solution of "bromide of po
tassium." This solution is made by tak
ing one ounce of bromide of potassium
and ten ounces of water, whlcn make a
! ten per cent solution. If the plate is over
timed add two or three drops of this and
It will help matters. But if too much Is
added it will only make bad matters
worse by causing another trouble, which
is a clogeing of the halftones and high
lights. Therefore, be very careful how
it is added. For convenience, however,
the normally timed plate will be -dealt
with here.
After the plate is flowed with the de
veloper and it has shown in say twenty
six seconds, the next thing that will puz
zle the novice is when to take the plate
out of the developer. One way to Judgf*
when a plate is developed far enough, and
one that has proved very satisfactory, la
to develop until the detail Is all out of the
deepest shadow in the picture when ex
amined by holding the negative up to the
developing light and looking through it
from the back. Another way is to de
velop until the high lights show through
on the back of the plate when looked at
as one would when lookiny at a picture
or when reading a letter. This Is one of
the most difficult things to understand
and can only be acquired by constant
practice. After the plate is developed
take it from the developer and rinse for
at least one minute under the tap or pour
several dippers of water over it. Then
place It In the "fixing bath." This fixing
bath is made of hyposulphite of soda and
water to test So degrees by the hydtn
meter. As the hyposulphite of soda is
cheap. It would not cost much to make It
up fresh for each lot of plates, and this
will be found to be the most satisfactory
in Its results. The plate should remain
in this bath for about five minutes after
all the creamy appearance has left the
back of the plate. Do not expose the'
plate to white light until after all this
creamy appearance has disappeared, as
it will cause the negative to have misty or
fogged shadows. When taken from the
fixing bath It should be washed for at
least thirty minutes under the tap or
flven about twelve or fifteen changes of
resh water of five minutes each. After
this washing the surface should be
"mopped" off with a wet tuft of absorbent
cotton to remove any sand or dirt that
may have been left by the waters Now
the negative is ready to hang up and dry
It should be set or hung In a dry place,
and. If possible, in a cool place, as thia
helps It to dry smoother and gives a more
firm surface.

FEDERATED CLUBS TO MEET.
The General Federation of Women's
Clubs; is to hold its biennial sessions this
summer in Milwaukee. '.Wls., and there is
already a stir in local organizations in
preparation for -the- meeting, which will
call to the Middle West delegates from
nearly all the. woman's clubs that have
sprung into being throughout the country
within the last quarterof a century. Cali
fornia will be represented pro.bably by in
dividual clubs as well as by the delegates
from the State Federation, which was
called into existence this winter in Los
Angeles, with Mrs.- Burdette as charter
president, for the understanding prevails
that- it Is the sentiment of the General
Federation to preserve club Individuality
in' representation wherever desired.

continue the studies

mense amount of solid
reading is done by the
people of San Francis-

felt that some means
was lacking to interest
a still larger public
in the great literary
masterpieces- and in
subjects of importance which lie somewhat but
of the current of everyday discussion.
.â¢ It seems to me that in the admirable arti

VIII.â DEVELOPING
BY FELIX RAYMER.
Now that the negative has been made
and we have our darkroom ready, the next
thing to do will be to develop the image.
It will be found on examination that the
film to all appearances is Just. the same
that it was when first placed in the plate
holder, so that It becomes necessary to do
something that will bring out the image
on the plate as we saw it on the ground
glass when we made the exposure. To do
this It is necessary to combine certain
chemicals and apply them to the plate.
This is called "developing," and the com
bination of chemicals is called the "de
veloper." The developer can be made up
in quantities in what Is called "stock so
lutions." By this it is meant that the
chemicals are mixed to a certain strength
and then each time there id an exposure
to be developed certain quantities are
taken from "stock solutions" for that
particular exposure, the remainder of the
"stock solution" being tightly corked for
future use. For the runateur. making only
a few exposures a month for pleasure, it
would possibly be more economical and
less troublesome to use some one of the
many ready prepared developers, any of
which will give good results when prop
erly used. These ready prepared solu
tions may be obtained from any reliable
stock house and directions for*their use
accompany each preparation. â¢ Believing,
however, that the greatest benefit ana
best work can be obtained by mixing our
own developer it is with that branch of
the developing we will now deal.
Doubtless what is known as the "pyro
gallic acid" developer is the most popular
of all the developers now in use, there
fore th.it will be mentioned first. The first
thing to do is to make up a "stock solu
tion" of the various chemicals used. This
is done in the following- way: Take three
bottles, each holding about one quart.
Number them 1 and 2 and 3. In number
one a solution of "carbonate of potas
sium" should be made to "test" 4) degrees.
This is done by means of a little instru
ment known as a hydrometer, obtained
from some stock dealer at a cost of about
50 cents. This hydrometer is a hollow
glass tube with a bar arranged something
like a thermometer which drops into the
tube. To test any solutfon the tube must
be filled with the liquid and the bar
dropped into it. when the strength of the
solution will be indicated on the scale of
the bar. This method for mixing chemi
cals is far more satisfactory than by
weight, as the chemicals are then always
made at exactly the same strength
whereas if made by weight they may vary
several degrees, from the fact that certain
chemicals when exposed to air lost some
of their strength, while others will in
crease in strength. Now, to get a 40-de
gree solution fill bottle No. 1 about two
thirds full of water and add carbonate of
potassium, a litjle at a time, shaking after
each addition until dissolved, and then
pouring the glass tube of the hydrometer
full and testing until the desired strength
is obtained. In bottle No. 2 a solution of
"sulphite of soda" should be made and
should test SO degrees. This test is made
m the same way as the "carbonate" test.
In bottle No. 3 put 2i ounces of water, in
which dissolve 15 grains of oxalic acid.
After, this is dissolved add one ounce of
pyrogallic acid.
Now everything is ready for developing
the plate. The same light may be used
that was used for holding the plate hold
trs. It will be supposed that the plate is
about five by seven Inches In size. Of
course, a tray of that size must be used.
To develop a plate five by seven inches in
size it will take at least four ounces of
developer to "flow" the plate properly, so
start in by taking one-half ounce of solu
tion No. 1. one-half ounce of solution No.
2 and one-half ounce of solution No. 3.
Add to this four ounces of water. In mix
ing the developers only the \-ery purest
water obtainable should be used.- Melted
ice gives a good, pure water. Now to get
the best results In developing it is neces
sary to understand Just what each chemi
cal does, so that If we find something
wrong it may be remedied. To begin with,
if a plate should be examined under a
powerful microscope It would be seen that
the film is deposited on the plate in the
form of small sacks, or globules. In each
of these little sacks is a tiny particle of
bromide of silver. When. the plate Is ex
posed the light affects any of this silver
that may be exposed to it. and by the use
of developers this affected silver is devel
oped Tip so that we get what we call the
"negative." The action of the carbonate
of potassium on the plate is to break these
\\\X\p sacks that have been acted upon by
the light. The pyrogallic acid is called the
"blackening agent." It Is this that causes

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 30. 1900/
7
Says They Appropriated Valuable
Properties and Took. Out Gold
Faster Than the Mints
Could Coin It.
H. R. de Noon of Rhodesia, South Af
rica, and J. M. L. Henry of Johannesburg,
are at the Russ. Both are mining men.
and left the Transvaal when war broke
out, fearing that if they remained they
would be forced to join the Boer army.
air. de Noon, an American by birth, has
spent twenty-five years in South Africa,
being the greater portion of that time in
the employ of Cecil Rhodes. As a boy he
worked, in the diamond mines at Kimberley
and later headed a party of explorers and
pioneers into Rhodesia. During his career
he came into contact with President Kru
ger, Joubert. Pretorius and other great
Boer leaders. Now he owns important
mining interests of his own in Rhodesia,
which he purposes developing as soon as
the war is over and the country becomes
settled. .
Mr. Henry had been but four years in
Johannesburg. His home is at Truckee.
where he has lived most of his life. In
Johannesburg he was employed in the
famous Summer & Jack mine, the largest
In the. country. ' When the mine is under
operation it employs about 600 white men
and 4000 blacks. When the war broke out
he says the whites were given eight days
in which to leave the country if they so
3esired.. Most of them decided to go, and
Henry fell in with the retreat. A few
men were left behind to work the pumps
and keep the mine free from water, but
it was afterward learned that these men
were driven oft by the burghers and the
mine left to itself. The Boers worked
about eleven of the best mines belonging
:o English and German capitalists, and. it
;s said, took out so much gold that they
fould not coin it and sold it at Delagoa
Bay for Â£2 10s an ounce, when the market
/alue was Â£3 10s.
Both Henry and De Noon remained at
Zape Town from the middle of October
mill February 1. hoping that peace would
oe declared. They then took ship for
\ustralla and thence home by ; way of
Victoria, B. C. They say thzÂ£ the war
;annot last long and laugh at the dispatch
mbllshed last night which said that there
svere 160.000 foreigners in the country
â¢eady to fight under the Boer flag. They
jlace, the number of uitlanders who re
gained in South Africa in order to join
he Boer cause at 20.000, and assert pos
tively that only a few thousand could
)osslbly have entered the country since.There were no fluctuations worthy of note
on the morning session of the Bond Exchange
though trading was very good.

Shipping Intelligence.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 29â The Stock Ex
change atmosphere was rather oppressive dur
ing to-day's session and .the offerings to take
profits were absorbed with less facility than
on previous days during this week. No bet
ter explanation of the reactionary tendency
of the market can be found than the falling
off In the demand for stocks. There was some
manipulation for the decline, which was effect
ive In the industrial* and specialties and
which brought out a volume of offerings that
looked like the uncovering of Etop-lcss orders.
But in the railroad list there was no indica
tion of forced selling. The profit-taking pro
ceeded apparently in orderly manner and any
considerable recession In prices led to a de
cline In the volume of offerings and a dull
market. Stocks which have gone up the most
during the week were naturally most affected,
notably the transcontinental railroads and the
Southern trunk lines. There was some Indi
cation of positive weakness in grangers and
the coalers, the tendency in the latter group
Ixrlng due to the rather disappointing Feb
ruary statement of net earnings for the Read-
Ing company. There were not lacking also
points of strength in the railroad list. The
most notable upward movement of the day
was in ?: Â«.kf of railroads in central traffic
territory and what might be called sub
sidiary Vandtrbllt lines. Big Four led- the
movement and :? was shared in by Chesapeake
and Ohio, Plttbburg. Cincinnati. Chicago and
Â£t. Louis. Canada Southern and the New York,
Chicago and Â£t. Louis stocks. The professed
ground of this advance was a conference of
railroad officials In this city looking to the
enforcement of acreexntnts to maintain rates.
The Atchlson stocks. Louisville and Nashville
and other less consjilcuouK stocks continued !
etrong. Aside from the df-slre to take profits
the halt in the buying demand was due to
epprehenslon over the Â«-ffect of the gloomy
official outgivings regarding the prospect for
the future dividends on the stock of the sugar
company. A eharp break In that stock at the
opening eeemed to have little effect on the
market, but when Its weakness was seen to
persist sympathetic heaviness developed else
where in the industrial list and among the:
local traction stocks. There was no indica
tion of etiffness in the money market, but
probably the relaxed dÂ«-mand for speculative
purposes had something to do with this. The
end of the month and the quarter Involve
rome preparation to meet dividends and in
terest obligations and this factor begot some
eplrit of caution about causing too freely the
facilities of the racr.ey market In speculation.
The sub-treasury for the first time this week
gained a small amount from the banks and
the Government institution's debit balance at
the clearing-house fell to $340,6i)>. as against
a dally average of nearly a million hereto
fore this week. This *ympton attracted at
tention notwithstanding that the rain between
the banks and nub-treasury for.the week still
amounts to considerably over a million dol
lars. London continued to trade actively in
this market, but with much less Influence on
sentiment than heretofore owing to the knowl
edge that the purchases for that account are
carried to a large extent by money borrowed
In New YorJc
The bond market continues active and for
the mon part strong, though there were points
of weakness In the list. Total sales, par value,

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
range and profit taking in many directions. The
tone was fairly good, though not strong. It
wan slightly affected by rumors of. trouble be
tween Russia and Japan over Korea. Ameri
cans were decidedly less active. They started
very sanguine, being a point above parity.
Louisville was strongly bought. Much profit
taking, however, caused sagging. New York
came as a buyer, of Chesapeake, but a seller of
others, and the close was dull. In the street
dealings were quieter than for a week. Lon
don professionals, who are rather overloaded,
are disappointed at New York's profit taking.
Paris is still buying Tlntos and New York
Anacondas. A fresh campaign has opened In
Utahs, Bostons and Avinos, which have been
aeleep for months.
The bank bought Â£30,000 in gold bars and lost
Â£10,000 to Argentine. There was a strong de.
mand for money for the 'big settlement and
requirements to end the quarter. All loans
due to the bank were renewed and there was
a very large fresh borrowing for the week.
Bills were very firm. The British Cotton and
\vool Dyers' Association will be floated next
week with Â£2.000.000 ordinary stock and Â£1,000,
000 debentures, amalgamating fifty firms.

New York Metal Market.
NEW YORK. March 29.â The local market
for metals continued to develop general ac

CHICAGO, March 29.â The wheat market
opened unchanged from yesterday at 66%@
67c. and then, probably because Liverpool was
lower than expected In view of the advance
here yesterday and because some private mes
sages contradicted yesterday's reports of dam
age to the French crop, sold off to 66% c. At
this point New York made an upward spurt
fearing war as an outgrowth of the difficulties
existing between Russia and Turkey, and the
local crowd of shorts covered In some alarm.
A report from Duluth of heavy export demands
assisted In the bulge, aa did the strength of
provisions. May rallied to 67% c. but failed
to hold It, although further cables from France
contradicted earlier ones, reasserting that the
damage In France was serious. There was
considerable profit taking at the top and
shorts apparently took a calmer view of' the
Turko-Russlan situation, for May sold oft to
66% c and closed barely steady a shade under
yesterday at 66ftc. At the advance the pit
was excited and at other times rather nervous.
The provision market repeated Its exhibition
of strength and excitement to a crowded pit.
Hogs were higher at the yards and receipts
small. This, with the heavy outside demand
and the frantic shorts trying to cover In a mar
ket where offerings were light, caused a swift
advance. May pork was the main attraction
opening at 17%@25c over yesterday at $12 65Â®
12 72% and in a wild burst of bidding shot up
to $13. the highest price since 1835. On the
bulge there was heavy profit taking. Lard
Buffered more than pork and ribs In this move.
Pork lost only part of the advance, closing
27% c over yesterday at $12 75. May lard closed
2%@5c lower and May ribs 7%c up.
The corn market was less active than wheat
and did little better than hold Its own, al
though the export business was put at 100
loads and provisions extended an Influence of
strength, while cables were strong. May closed
a â¢ shade over yesterday. ,
The oats market was firm, with July In Bome
what better demand than May. Trade was
without much feature and quiet. May closed
unchanged.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO. March 29.â Deputy Sher
iff Lowder of this place attempted to as
sist the officers of the revenue cutter
Rush in running affairs on board that
craft, and as a result went up against It
in a way that has made him ever since
the water front's standing joke.
The skipper of the revenue cutter had
called all hands to man the whistle cord
and have a little signal practicing. Then
followed a long .series of doleful howls of
varying lengths which came near caus
ing a panic among the hill tribe and water
front. The report spread that mutiny was
rampant on the cutter and help was
needed. Lowder heard the whistles and
the rumor. Buckling on a star and call
ing for volunteers, he pulled to the res
cue. The cutter's side reached. .Lowder
bristling with importance -showed his star
and asked the officer on watch if he need
ed police protection. The .sea rover scru
tinized his questioner a moment and then
intimated in navy blue language that
Lowder would need protection himself if
he did not haul off. Lowder insists that
there was a mutiny, but says the sight
of the majesty of the law, as vested in
him, nipped it In the bud.

DANGERS LURK
IN PHOTOGRAPHS
AND MISSIVES
They Prove Very Important
Factors in Fink's
Divorce.
Husband Found Letters Signed "His
Nibs" and "Ed," and a Pho
tograph in Which He Does
Not Figure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, March 29.
The Fink divorce case occupied the at
tention of Judge Hall all day and the
family quarrels were rehearsed for the
benefit of the Judge who , will have to
finally settle the alimony question.
The letters which Fink threatened yes
terday to produce were not brought into
court, though Mr. Fink told of finding
them In his wife's trunk. One of the let
ters, he said, was signed "His Nibs," and
the other "Ed," and he thought they were
written by the same person. The letters
breathed thoughts of love and good times.
The much talked of "photographs"
proved to be some tintypes taken at some
â¢"flnished-in-ten-minutes" gallery. The
pictures showed some man. very evidently
not Mr. Fink, who had his head on the
shoulder of Mrs. Fink. There was some
discussion as to whether the head was
on the shoulder or being held in Mrs.
Flnk'B arms, but Jiidpe Ogden suggested
that he could see the photograph without
the aid of an argument.
Mrs. Fink denios the existence of any
letters such as her husband described.

TO SHED LIGHT
OH WHAT IS A
VISIBLE MOON
No Precedent Known to the
Law on Which to Base
a Just Decision.
A Witness Who Confessed ; Entire
Ignorance on the Subject of As
tronomical Phenomena and
Similar Things.
?
ALAMEDA, March 29.â Recorder St.
Sure is wrestling with the problem, "Is a
clouded moon as good as any old moon?"
The Judge will have to rely entirely on his
own resources to solve this perplexing
problem, as there is no precedent known
to the law to guide him to a just decision.
Upon this decision hangs the fate of $3,
deposited by School Director Frank Otis
when he was arrested, March 14, for not
carrying a light on his bicycle, as a city
ordinance says everybody must do.
This now famous ordinance allows
cyclists the privilege of riding without
lights when the moon is visible between
the second and third quarters. ' When
Mr. Otis was arrested the moon was do
ing the heavens between the second and
third quarters, but at the particular hour
he was nabbed by a policeman an Incon
siderate cloud obscured its face. He de
manded a trial for the purpose of getting
a decision on the construction of the word
"visible." Last night the trial engaged
the attention of City Recorder St. Sure
and a large number of citizens.
City Attorney E. K. Taylor and Letter
Carrier Floyd were the principal witnesses
for the prosecution. The City Attorney
said he had taken an hour's constitutional
on his wheel on the night in question and
to him the moon was visible. He was
asked if he carried a lantern.
"No. I did not," replied the witness,
"and i thanked my lucky stars the next
day when I read about the arrest of Mr.
Letter-Carrier Floyd confessed that he
was not an authority on constellations,
nebulae, milky ways, orbits and other
astronomical phenomena.
Vlf the moon had been above the horizon
on the night the defendant was arrested,
would you have seen it?" queried Mr.
Otis, who conducted his own defense.
"Well, I never studied astronomy, so I
don't know," was the reply.
Mr. Otis submitted all kinds of testi
mony to show that the moon was visible,
but the City Recorder took the matter
under advisement and will render his de
cision later.

PERCY DAVIS THE
VICTIM OF THUGS
OAKLAND. March 30.â Percy L. Davis,
a manufacturer's representative, with of
fices in the Flood building in San Fran
cisco, left his hotel in Oakland last night
to visit in Alameda. He returned a short
time after midnight this morning In a
dazed condition and had almost lost the
power of speech. He was otherwise In
deep distress. A doctor was summoned,
who, after an examination, gave it as
his opinion that Davis was the victim of
thugs and had probably been sandbagged.
His valuables were found intact, showing
that no attempt had been made to rob
him.
There Is a large lump behind the ear,
which could have been made with a sand
bag, and a cut in the inside of the mouth.
The strange case was immediately re
ported to the police, but up to a late hour
they had not succeeded In finding out how
Davis had been injured.

was melancholy. There were no garish
colors, irome railed it dreary, but to her
it was pleasing. It might be said .that

HURLED INTO SPACE
BY NOVEL CATAPULT
OAKLAND, March 29.â J. S. Scott, a painter, employed at Hay & Wright's
shipyard, was the victim of an accident of a peculiar nature to-day, as
the result of which the unfortunate man lies on a bed of pain at his res
idence, 604 Eighteenth street. The injured painter was made to servo as
a projectile for a novel catapult, and soared to a height of thirty feet before
he began the downward journey to earth. '
Scott was seated on the end of a "falls," or hanging scaffold, and was en
gaged in painting the side of a ship, when several men undertook to carry a
heavy steel casting along the ship's deck. One of these workmen stumbled'
and fell and the others dropped the casting, which toppled over the side of the
ship and struck the suspended scaffold squarely In the center. The plank
broke in two with a loud snap and the painter was hurled into the air. He was
rendered unconscious by the force of his fall.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where an examination by Drs.
Stratton and Ewer showed that he had sustained a fracture of the seventh
rib on the right side, a sprain of the spinal column and numerous cuts and
bruises. The injury to the man's spinal column is regarded as very serious.

FRANCE IS FRIENDLY.
Will Interpose No Objections to the
Purchase of the Danish Indies.
PARIS. March 29, 1:20 P. M.â The For
eign Office authorities make the follow
ing statement regarding France's atti
tude toward American acquisition of the
Danish West Indies:
"France will place no obstacle what
ever In the way of success of the Danish-
American negotiations. On the contrary
in view of her cordial relations with
both the United States and Denmark, she
is willing' to waive her rights over Santa
Cruz, as France values her friendship
with these two countries far more highly
than any claims she may have in the
Danish Antilles."
Municipal Rights Defined.
SANTA ROSA, March 29.â The Supreme
Court has reversed the judgment of the
Superior Court In the case of the city of
Cloverdale against Patrick and Ann
Smith, an action brought against the
Smiths to restrain them from turning sur
face water from their land Into certain
streets of the town. The lower court gave
judgment in favor of the defendants. The
Supreme Court decision is of great im
portance, not only to Cloverdale, but to
other cities, as it settles the right of mu
nicipalities to regulate private enterprises
that inflict public hardship.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 29.â
In a letter to Secretary Clark, received
to-day. President Jordan Bays that the
press reports of his lecture in Chicago re
cently on "The Blood of the Nation" were
grossly incorrect, and apparently had been
written by some one who did not hear the
address. Continuing, he. says: "I have
maintained that England; was a degener
ate nation, but that the decay of nations
was primarily and almost solely due to
military selection and the slaughter of
the available for service In war."

FRIEND WATSON IS A
LUCKY BENEFICIARY
OAKLAND, March 29.â A petition was
filed to-day by John F. More of Santa
Barbara and P. W. Watson of San Fran
cisco for the probate of the will of Elea
nor H. More, in which they are named as
executors without bonds. The property
disposed of amounts in the aggregate to
$oO,lHXÂ». and the terms of the instrument
are of a nature which makes a contest
almost a certainty.
The testatrix, who was a resident of this
city, died at Monroe. lowa, on March 13,
1900. The bulk of her property was com
posed of 2006 shares of stock in the Santa
Rosa Island Company. She was also the
owner of considerable real estate and per
sonal property In lowa.
John F. More, a brother, was bequeathed
$15,000: P. W. Watson, a "friend." $10,000;
Mrs. Martha J. Orcutt. a sister, $5000, and
a large number of relatives, friends and
religious and charitable institutions
amounts ranging from $50 to $500. Eliza
M. Miller, another sister, was bequeathed
onlv'sso. It Is expÂ«>ctefl that -Mrs. Miller
will contest the will, and it is possible
that she may be joined by other relatives,
who object to the size of Watson's legacy.
Miss Annie M. Quince was held at 11
o'clock this morning from her late resi
dence. 559 Harrison street. A large num
ber of schoolteachers and public school
pupils, among whom the deceased had
labored for years, were present. Services
at the house were conducted by Rev. J. C.
Wooten, pastor of Asbury Methodist

CUSHING & WETMORE
SECURE BIG DAMAGES
Gray Brothers Must Pay Five Thou
sand Dollars for the Telegraph
Hill Blockade.
A Jury 5n Judge Hunt's court yesterday
pave judgment for the plaintiff for $5000
damages in the suit of the Cushing-Wet
more Company against George F. and
Harry M. Gray, composing the firm of
Crray Bros.
The case was a peculiar one. At the
time that the damages were inflicted upon
the plaintiff it attracted much attention
Â£.nd the facts formed the basis of numer-
OUS newspaper stories.
The Cushir.g-Wetmore Company owns
a lot of land on Telegraph Hill, at the
corn<r of Lombard and A\ inthrop streets
from which they were engaged in taking
out rock for streÂ«?t purposes. The only
exit nu along I^jmbard street, under the
edge of the cliff, the passage being very
narrow. Last May Gray Bros, blasted out
a quantity of rock in such a way as to
effectually block the roadway, and re
-fus^.i to remove the debris. The Cush
<r.g-W.-tmore Company then cut out a
rough road along \Vlnthrop street. Gray
Bros, own the adjoining property and se
cured permission to buiH a sidewalk in
Fuch a position that heavy timbers tilled
thÂ« road. The obstruction was removed
liy thÂ«Â» <;ushinu-WÂ«?tmore Company In just
Â«-]<*ven minutes. Grsy Bros, enters pnit
atiil speared judgment for $50 damages.
An appeal wa.s taken by the defendant
hut the ease has been hanging fire for
eight months. \
Isy winning the suit the Cushing-Wet
rnore Company will hereafter be protect
ed by an injunction from the court
Wright &. Lukens were attorneys for the
plaintiffs.
TO EXTEND SCOPE
OF UNIVERSITY
Faculty Working on a Plan That
Will Make It a Pacific Coast
Institution.
Believe Berkeley Can Be Made the Educational
Center of the Entire Region West
of the Rockies.
BERKELEY, March 29.â The Univer
sity of California will extend its
scope over the entire coast by ac
crediting high schools outside of
this State, Including those in the States
of Washington, Oregon and Nevada. This
Is the most important move of the
"Greater University of California" that
has been proposed since the plans for the
new university were made and It means a
great deal. It means that the University
of California will become a Pacific Coast
institution and not a State Institution
alone. It means that the State University
is going into other territory for students
and will give the residents of other States
greater educational opportunities. It will
make the entire coast tributary to Berke
ley in an educational way. It means that
the University of California; will become
like Yale, Harvard and other great uni
versities of the East. It means that the
"Greater University of California" will
become the fountain head of education for
the coast and may in time take in all the
great country west of the Mississippi
River.
At present only schools In this State are
accredited to the University of California.
The graduates of the schools outside the
State are compelled to undergo a rigid
examination, even though their curricu
lum is as high as the accredited schools
of this State. The lack of funds at pres
ent prevents immediate action being taken
to include outside schools, but as soon as
the necessary funds can be had an exam
ining committee will be sent to Inspect
the high schools In Oregon. The Portland
High School will probably be the first
school accredited, as its standard is par
ticularly high.
By broadening the policy of the Univer
sity of California it is expected the State
in general and the institution in particu
lar will be greatly benefited. President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler believes many
Eromlnent families will be drawn hither
y the opportunity given their children
to attend college at Berkeley.
"As trade follows the flag," be says, "ao
must business follow education."
Professor Frederick Slate, chairman of
the committee on accrediting high schools,
says:
"The question of groins beyond the bor
ders of this State and admitting second
ary schools to our accredited lists is not
entirely a new one with us, but it has now
reached such & point that It will be put
Into effect as soon as the necessary finan
ces are provided. I think we are all agreed
that we should reach out to other States.
"Ten years ago we began to organize our
high schools Into a system and admit
their graduates to our ranks without ex
amination. That work has been carried
en very successfully ever since, until now
we have nearly a perfect system. Some
time ago It was suggested that we extend
our sphere to Include the neighboring
States. The suggestion met with hearty
approval, but nothing has been done be
cause of the lack of finances. With a
State Institution that is usually a very
vital question. "We cannot deprive our
California schools of our Investigation if
our funds go no further. If there was
plenty of money I would be heartily In fa
vor of going into other States for high
schools. Our field must not be confined
to California, but the best secondary
schools of other States must be given a
place on our lists.
"The Portland High School Is a splen
did one and will probably he among thÂ«
first to be looked Into by us. To send a
committee to examine the school will cost
about $100, which is unavailable at pres
ent. It won't be long, though, I predict,
before representative schools from Wash
ington. Oregon and Nevada are admitted.
"These schools are very anxious to Join
our ranks. It will mean much to our
State. Even now there are a few of our
neighboring States' sons and daughters
who attend this Institution. They are of
the best families and the kind we most
desire. It usually means that where the
children go the families follow. In that
way our population is Increased by the
most desirable people. The State will
therefore be benefited as well as the In
stitution.
"I want to ace the accrediting lists of
the Lnlversity of California soon contain
the names of schools in all our neighbor
ing States."
FLAG EXPERTS
INSIST UPON
NEW DESIGNS
Mayor Phelan's Dream De
velops Into a Disagree- .
able Nightmare.
Competitors Have Been Unable to
Suggest an Emblem More Sig
nificant Than the Stars
and Stripes.
Mayor Phelan 1b la trouble. He has
beta unable to discover any one clever
enough to submit a design for a municipal
flag. The competition consequently has
been reopened and ambitious designers,
who believe that they can improve upon
the stars and stripes, are requested to
1 lace their ideas in the keeping of the
judges chosen by his Honor the Mayor.
After a critical inspection of the designs
presented the Judges decided that none
were satisfactory. The competitors neg
lected to observe one of the first essentials
of flag makingâ simplicity. The judges, In
rendering their opinion, believe that a
white background is absolutely necessary.
Competitors, It appears, followed their
knowledge of contemporary events and
madtf the background mack.
The committee selected by the Mayor to
vj.Jjre the submitted designs for a muni
cipal flag in deciding to reopen
the corni-etltion has ruled as fol
lows: All designs must show a
white field as a background; only two
colors may be usedâ one for the design
nad the other for the motto; the design
must express some symbol emblematic of
the municipality: the motto. "Gold in
peace, < ron j n waT< " must blend harmo
niously. The following competitors were
mentioned as deserving of special com
mendation and the committee suggested
that they try again:. -Foster," "S. A.."

"JACK" WELCH IS IN
DEMAND FOR REFEREE
Selected to Supervise the Bean-Qreea
Fight Before the Columbia
Athletic Club.
"Jack" "Welch, thÂ© broad-shouldered
patron of boxing from the Potrero, is
quite the vogue as referee in bouts with
the gloves Just now. He will be the third
man In the ring to-night, when "Pro
fessor" Wlllard Bean and ''Soldier" Phil
Green settle thefr differences.
The bout will be under the direction of
Columbia Athletic Club, and will be held
in the arena at Woodward's Pavilion. In
addition Jimmy Lawlor and Jack Kane
will meet for the second time* within the
present month. Lawlor secured a decis
ion over Kane after twenty rounds of
hard fighting. He showed to better ad
vantage than at any time in his ring ca
reer. Kane was not satisfied with the out
come of the bout, hence, the meeting to
morrow night.
; In addition to this, forty rounds of box
ing which has beejr arranged for there
will be an eight-round bout between "Al
ligator" Dobson and Mike Welsh, which
should prove an Interesting curtain raiser.
The pool room managers have taken a
stand in the matter of fake fights. They
will not hereafter sell pools on any fight
if either of the principals has been mixed
up in any Jobbery connected with boxing.
The betting at Harry Corbett's last
night showed Green a slight favorite over
Bean, the prevailing odds being 10 to 6.
Bean had a large following at these
figures and there was plenty of money
offered on him. The Kane and Lawler
bout was an even-money proposition, with
more Kane money than Lawler money in
sight. This in the face of Kane's recent
defeat by Lawler.

WOULD NOT REPEAL
THE EXCLUSION ACT
Chinese Consul General Ho Toy Ex
plains His Object in Conferring
With Merchants.
Chinese Consul â¢ General Ho Tow Is In
dignant at the story In a morning paper
implicating him In an attempt to secure
the repeal of the Chinese exclusion law.
The article was based on the appearance
of the Consul before the merchants of this
city, to whom he appealed for better pro
tection for Chinese merchants, who are
obliged to visit China at frequent periods
and who have often been denied a landing
upon their return by the Federal authori
ties. The Consul made the following
statement In justification of himself:
When I met the merchants of this city a few
days ago to discuss tho provisions of an act
which excludes Chinese laborers from the
United States I stated that certain hardships
had been worked on the Chinese merchants. A
morning paper has raised the question as to
what wrongs, tho merchants have suffered, and
I will attempt to explain. While the exclusion
act only prevents laborers from Undlnie, yet
great difficulty has been ' experienced by the
mercantile class in securing admittance to the
country, and many have been held prisoners for
days and. In some cases, weeks. This dlscour
aces trade. . and I asked the American mer
chants to use their influence In recttfyinr the
evil. :
I wish It stated that I am not in favor of an
Influx of Chinese labor, and will make no effort
to accomplish such a thing.
CHINESE WISH TO
DECORATE STREETS
Feast of the Dragon Would ' Bring
Many People ' to This
City.
The action of. the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors in recommend
ing that the request of Consul General
Ho Vow that Market street be decorated
for the Feast of ' the Dragon, â¢ to be ob
served in this - city ; during the month of
June, |be denied, ' has caused ' much com
ment among the Chinese.
Ho Vow says the celebration will be
conducted on a grand scale, and that It
will bring thousands of: visitors and dol
lars to the city. It will be the first ob
servance of such a feast In the United
States and mftch interest will be excited.
The Chinese, he claims, have been active
In assisting in American celebrations, as
shown by their gorgeous display In the
last Fourth of July. parade, and a refusal
to. allow them permission to make a dis
play Buch as they have requested would
be considered a cause of resentment by
them and would discourage any future
enthusiasm. i
. The Consul and the Chinese will petition
the Supervisors to Ignore-, the commit
tee's recommendation and permit their
celebration â¢to proceed. Â¦ Â¦
SIXTH STREET GRADE
TO BE RE-ESTABLISHED
Property-Owners "Will be Afforded
Beliefâ Decorations Will Be Re
stricted to Chinatown.
The Supervisors' Street Committee yes-
terday decided to refer the matter of flx
lng the official grade of Sixth street to
Chairman" Maguire of the committee and
Deputy Donovan, who will confer with
the Board of Public Works with a view
to establishing a grade that will be satis
factory to the property owners. I A num
ber of taxpayers in the surrounding dis
trict addressed the committee regarding
the bad condition of the street. Â¦
Henry B. Russ stated the railroad com-
recently tore up Sixth street and
raised a certain portion of the street
greatly above other portions. Business in
the neighborhood has deteriorated, pedes
trians are deterred -from traveling on the
Btreet and 'the proposition needs immedi
ate relief. Messrs. Napthaly and Gudskall
made a plea for a uniform grade and Bald
that the property owners are willing to
raise the rldewalks and buildings to con
form to the grade.
The committee decided to restrict the
decorations for the national Chinese fes
tival in the month of July to the streets
of Chinatown. The parade will only be
allowed to traverse those streets on the
occasion.
The Board of Public Works will bÂ« In
structed to request the Park Commission
er* to reopen the gates on Stanyan street,
near Walter, so as to give citizens in the
vicinity an outlet for the district south
of the park until such time as funds are
available to lay sidewalks on Frederick
Btreet from First to Second avenue,
â¢which was deeded to the city by the Su
tro f-ntate and the Market Street Railway
Company. '?.:.

An Insolvent Sheriff.
G. -W. Griffln, farmer and Sheriff of
Tolo County, filed a petition to Insolvency
yesterday in tho United States District
Court. His liabilities are $30,051 and
assets $4045. A telegram from Woodland
states that Griffin haa been Insolvent a
long time. Crop failure waa thÂ» principal
cause of his troubles. His action causes
no surprise there. Â¦
the week between the signing of the
agreement contract and â¢ Marceau's de
parture for the south he called each day
at his former wife's home. He lunched
with her and dined with her and on each
occasion shed copious tears.
"On the day he left," said Mrs. Fen
nell, "he brought me up an immense
bunch of American beauty roses. 'I will
tie these with a bit of blue ribbon for
baby's cradle,' I said. 'Put 'them away
in a little box I treasure and keep
them forever.' He understood by that
how deeply I felt his protestation of love
for me. He came toward me. I raised
my face. 'My God, I dare not trust my
self to kiss you,' he said, and then I
kissed him. once. I was satisfied. But
then he took my face between his hands
and kissed me repeatedly and passionate
ly. Then he went away with baby and
my son. Allen Flske accompanied him
across the bay. When he was about to
step aboard the train he turned to Allen
and said, 'Take good care of -your dear
mother,' and shoving three coins in Al
len's hand he begged his indulgence for
the small amount and went away. The
coins he had placed in Allen's hand were
three gold twenties."
When Colonel Marceau and Mrs. Fen
nell made their plans for their remarriage
they decided the wedding was to be a
very quiet one,' but sentiment was to
have full sway at the affair. y
"We arranged to go away to be mar
ried," said Mrs. Fennell, "and Chaplain
Fiske, who united us nearly ten years
ago, was to Join us together again. :
There was very little of the romance of
the past few weeks left in the determined
little lady's heart last evening when she
boarded the Owl train. Her son Allen,
a manly little fellow 12 years of age, ac
companied her, "to look after mamma."
"I'll be back soon, she said, "and I'll
bring baby Theo back with me."
Notwithstanding his protestations by
phone yesterday, Colonel Marceau sang
the same tune last night to The Call re
porter he sang the night before. In. an
interview he repeated the statement that
he did not intend to marry his former
wife. He declared that as his boy was
growing older. In order that he might
properly understand his relation to both
parents, he (Marceau) granted Mrs. Mar
ceau an Interview with the result that
he has the boy. He added that the mother
occasionally would be permitted to see
her child.
The dispatch containing this informa
tion continues: "The boy and nurse are
at this hour in room 134, Hollenbeck
Hotel, and if any intention exists to kid
nap the boy and leave the State no ink
ling of such a plan appears on the sur
face. Marceau was on the streets this
afternoon, In a light suit, dapper and
debonair, telling his . friends that his
automobile would be here Saturday.
Business 13 proceeding at the gallery as
usual. -. â¢>..â Â¦-;:
"The Call story has created wide com
ment, and Marceau has become the ob
ject of . observation. Any extraordinary
move he makes would arouse suspicion.
Her Troubles Increasing.

prietress of a lodging-house at 128 OTar
rell street, are Increasing. Yesterday aha

TO SPRINKLE STREETS
AS AN EXPERIMENT
Supervisors to Aid the Merchants'
Association in Its Endeavor to
Solve Dust Problem.
The Supervisors' Joint committee on
Streets and Health yesterday decided to
recommend that permission be given the
Merchants' Association to sprinkle the
streets of the city in a scientific manner
as an experiment for thirty days. Action
on the ordinance repealing another meas
ure prohibiting sprinkling of bitumlnized
pavements was deferred until the result
of the experiment Inaugurated by the
association has been reported to the com-
C. Holbrook and Jeremiah Deasy argued
against the repeal of the order on the
ground that the sprinkling of bituminized
streets made them dangerous to life and
limb. They were followed by F. W. Dohr
mann, who stated that tha question of
getting away with the dust of the city
was a big problem which the association
was trying to solve to the satisfaction of
all interested parties. _
"The problem may be solved," said Mr.
Dohrmann, "if you adopt a scientific sys
tem of sprinkling the streets. Experi
ments will be soon begun by sprinkling
two blocks with salt water and two blocks
with sweet water, and these might be
extended to sprinkle the macadamized
streets where the dust emanates. I would
advise a light sprinkling, so that the
streets will be moistened only. Give us
permission to do bo for thirty days. We
will do it at our own expense, though the
city should contribute to the plan.'
Supervisor d'Ancona advised the sprin
kling of the streets as a sanitary pre
caution, and believed that 100 horses
should be ruined rather than one Inhabi
tant should get consumption by germs in
the dust. Messrs. Hale, Kelly and King
spoke of the injury the flying dust caused
in dry-goods stores, and the desired per
mission asked by the Merchants' Asso
ciation, which appeared to satisfy both
sides, will , be granted.
CAUGHT IN A
SOUTHWESTER
OFF THE COAST
Horse Transports Bound for
Manila Are Having a
1 Hard Time.
Changes Among: the Captains of tlie
Alaska Packers' Association.
Ships in Heavy "Weather.
Captain Dobson Sick.
Three of the United ,States transports
must have had a very lively time of it
during the early days of March unless the
weather reports of the steamers from this
coast -to Hawaii are all at fault. From
March 10 to 15 nothing but southeast gales
were encountered, and as a terrific sea
was running every Hawaiian bound ves
sel - must have had more or less, trouble.
A fleet of at least forty craft were right
in the way of the storm and the cbanc.es
are that none of them escaped the fury of
the elements. In consequence, long trips
to the Islands are now sure to be in or
der. â¢ J.- ,
The mall steamer Aorangl left Victoria,
B. C. , March - 10, bound for "Australia via
Honolulu. When ; twenty-four hours out
she ran into a heavy, southwest gale, ac
companied by a very ; heavy head sea,
which lasted . five days^b The mail boat
was a day late in reaching Hawaii and
considerable damage v/*3 reported to her
deck hamper on her arrival there.
The United States horse transport Slam
left San Francisco March 10 with 353
horses aboard, while the Lennox with 457
horses- and the Port Stevens with 510
horses left Astoria March 12 bound for
Manila via the Hawaiian Islands. The
mall steamer Australia left Honolulu on
the 20th inst., and at that time nothing
had been heard from the Slam, Lennox
or Port Stevens. Reasoning from these
facts, the Hawaiian Star published the
following:
Tbe transport Slam, with BS3 horses and
mules, was to leave San Francisco on tbe 7th
of this month, . and tbe Lennox and Port
Stevens were to leave Portland with 457 - and
SlO, respectively. The reports brought by- the
Aorangt and other steamers Indicate that the
transports must have struck fearful weather
and a long list of deaths among tbe antmala
would not surprise the army authorities. The
Slam Is now twelve days out if she Is coming
here, and If she was sent to Hllo she should
have been there on Saturday (17th Inst.), but
had not arrived. Tbe Slam Is the steamer that
lost so many horses In a typhoon after leav
ing here. The Lennox and Port Stevens have
both been through rough weather with horses,
the latter losing thirteen in one trip here. The
storm they have probably struck this time,
however, is a worse one than any of them
have met except the disastrous experience of
the Slam, and news of how the animals fared
is waited with some anxiety.
Among seafaring men it is not thought
for â¢an Instant that any of the vessels
named have suffered to any serious ex
tent in the gale, but as to the horses and
mules no one will make a guess as to the
mortality. Captain Harry Struve of the
Hancock thinks that if tbe three trans
ports hove to during the storm the mor
tality may have been slight. Captain
Barneson, superintendent of the transport
service, is of the opinion that the loss of
animals will not be beyond the average.
Still with the list of losses on the Lennox
off Flattery during her former trip and
the losses on the Slam in a typhoon on
her last voyage the Government officials
are awaiting anxiously news from Ha
waii as to the Slam, Lennox and Port
Stevens.
Captain Dobson of the transport Rosen
cranz, formerly the Columbia, is a very
sick man. He Is at St. Mary's Hospital
and tho sailing of his vessel .for Puget
Sound has * been postponed on that ac
count. -While, the best is hoped, still Cap
tain Dobson's friends admit that his con
dition is critical.
Advices received from Buenos Ayres by
tbe Merchants' Kxchange state that the
French bark Eugenia Fautrel, from
Swansea for San Francisco, had put In
there In distress. Her rudder haa been
damaged In a gale and the captain had
to run for the nearest port. - A survey was
held- and the discharge of the vessel's
cargo was recommended. The Eugenia
Fautrel may not be looked for here before
July next. > , â¢ . Â¦ .
Ihe German ship Arethusa, from Ham
burg for Seattle, is also In distress. Ac
cording to advices received by the Mer
chants Exchange, she Is In Montevideo
In a badly damaged condition. Twenty
two of her frames were smashed in dur
ing heavy. weather and the Arethusa will
have to discharge and dock for repairs.
There has been the biggest shaking up
among the captains of the Alaska Pack
ers' Association ever known- In its his
tory. Nearly every vessel in the fleet
has a new . master, ; and . while many of
the men have severed their connections
of their own volition, still one or two
were not acceptable to the management.'
Â¦ â¢Of course everybody knows - that . Cap
tain Wagner of the Premier has gone to
the â¢ gold â¢ fields, ; and , that Captain Gun
nerson, late: mate Â¦of the : Lewellyn J.
Morse, took the vessel out. Captain Verry
of the Indiana â¢ has retired - and Captain
George Bolton takes , his place. -' Captain
Salvesen of the Lewellyn J. < Morse waa
transferred to the George - Skolfleld. Aa
he did not like the change, he resigned,
and Captain Svensen'of the Will W. Case
took his place. Captain Anderson, for
merly mate of the Oriental, takes com
mand of the Will W.:Case and Captain
Stannard takes the Centennial,. vice Cap
tain Marshall,, who takes the Lewellyn J.
Morse. . . . '
- Captain W. Dledrichson of. the Red
Stack Towboat Company met i with ia : se
rious accident yesterday. He was driv

BUBONIC PLAGUE
NEVER EXISTED
IN THE ISLANDS
Honolulu Merchants Com
mence to Realize They
Have Been Bunkoed.
Specialists From Japan and India
Say It Was Typhoidâ Herman
Levy's Relatives May Sue
Government.
Private letters received in the last mail
from Honolulu show that the business
men of that city are Just awakening to
the fact that there has been a large, per
centage of bunko game in the black
plague phantom that has hung over the
Islands during the past three months,
bringing with it business disaster, de
struction of property and the loss of mil
lions of dollars to the public treasury.
A prominent business man of Honolulu
now in this city has received word that
on the eve of the sailing of the last steam
er a call was about to be issued by the
Chamber of Commerce for a public in
dignation meeting.
It Is now openly asserted that there
never has been a case of bubonic plague
In Honolulu. L. E. Pinfcham", a well
known railroad man from the Paradise
of the Pacific, says that many learned
doctors have been studying the alleged
cases of plague, and say that not one of
tiie cases that came under the notice of
the Board of Health was bubonic plague.
The assertion is made that the disease
which carried on" so many of the Chinese,
Japanese and Hawaiians was nothing
more than a malignant type of typhoid
and pneumonia.
Recently the streets of Honolulu have
been dug up for the laying of a sewerage
system. For years, . particularly in the
Chinese quarter, the soil had been satur
ated with filth. When it was turned up
noisome smells camo from the disturbed
ground, and it was predicted that dis
ease- would follow.
A prominent sugar planter, who says
that the plague scare has already cost
him $250,000, is in town, and expresses
great indiglnatlon at the slate of affairs.
In an interview he said:
"Sixty deaths from typhoid fever and
pneumonia In three months' time would
never be considered a very high death rate
in Honolulu. The natives die readily from
almost any disease that takes a tirm hold ;
on them. I believe that many of the Chi
nese patients were scared to death. A
San Francisco paper recently stated that
a Chinese fireman on a transport in thia
harbor who was merely suffering from
beriberi died after having been put
through a rigid examination Dy the quar
antine officials, lasting for an hour. The
ship's surgeon stated openly at the time
that he had been frightened to death. If
a Chinese makes up his mind that he is a
very sick man he will die anyway, even
if he had only a toothache.
"The Board of Health at Honolulu has
pounced upon every case of fever report
ed, and there Is no doubt in my mind that
their method of handling, patients has
often proved fatal. Take the case of Her
man Levy, tho hotel clerk, for instance.
Even to-day the Health Board will not
assert that he .is suffering from the
plague, yet when the board first took up
his case they had him removed, at 2
o'clock in the morning, while he was dan
gerously ill, from his cottage to the pest
house, where he still is. His own physi
cian says that he suffered a relapse under
this treatment, which will likely cost him
his life or make him an Invalid for the
remainder of his days. A"- l -<-' l > S
"In any case, I understand that Levy 8
relatives will bring a heavy damage suit
against the Hawaiian Government. If the
suit comes to trial there will likely be
many interesting developments, and no
doubt all available expert testimony will
be introduced. It will at least be deter
mined whether or not the plague ever did
exist in Honolulu. If the suit is successful
it will set the pace for several score of
similar suits, and the public purae will
have to stand a tremendous drain.
There are now In Honolulu two learned
Japanese doctors^-one sent, it is stated,
by the Japanese Government and the
other by a Japanese emigration society.
Both are familiar with the bubonic
plague in all its phases and both have
been unable to find that it ever existed
in Honolulu. Another physician, who
spent many years in India and -studied
the disease there in all its forms, is now
in Honolulu. He laughs at the idea that
the ' plague has made its appearance in
Honolulu. He saw several cases and pro
nounced them typhoid. He points out.
too, that if the disease had ever existed
In Honolulu over a period of three months
or three weeks it would have become ep
idemic. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦
Such is the evidence that is now being
collected Â¦ by the business men of Hono
lulu and they are getting angry clear
through, according to mail advices. The
Board of Health haa spent $500,000 and de
stroyed $1,500,000 worth of property and
now It is calling for more money. Inves
tigations have been set afoot concerning
the manner in which the money has been
spent, and there have been Rome start
ling revelations. The bacteriologist has
been drawing a salary equal to that of
the President of the republic in its palmi
est days and some of his associates are
said to be doing as well. They have kept
the people in terror by waving the black
phantom over them, but the scare has
played out and the business men . will
now call a halt. A fair estimate is that
the plague scare has cost Hawaii $2,500,
000 and possibly will cost twice that much
in damage to her commercial interests.
The charge is made that the Honolulu
Board of Health has kept in its employ
as guards and. inspectors the worst class
of men in the community, paying $3 per
day to men not capable of earning $20
per month. These men are political roust
abouts. It is charged that they get drunk
an native beer and liquor and carouse
with the very people they have been de
tailed to guard in quarantine. The quar
antine â¢ has been a farce all the way
through, but It has cost the taxpayers a
fortune.. .
Honolulu people now In town are look-
Ing forward to a big sensation when the
business men awaken and - commence to

STANTON WILL NOT
STAND FOR SIGNS
TfOHN STANTON, artist and Park Commissioner, says the "blistering
â¢ abominations"â the advertisements that mar the, beauty of thai parkâ
ft\J] must go.: His artistic sense is shocked every time he thinks of them In
â or about Golden Gate pleasure ground. The last. blow waa the erection
of a sign on the wire netting that surrounds the new buffalo paddock at the
end of the speed track. , - ' . â¢
A ( well-known steel and wire company, primarily - out of pure charity, but
Incidentally with a view to business, donated to the Park Commissioners; a
wire fence for the new paddock, the condition 'attached to -the "gift being: the
erection of a sign showing the munificence of the donors. This was too harsh
a mutilation of the wiry beauty of the fence, and Stanton ordered It to be con
fiscated.
* In speaking of the matter Mr. Stanton says that while the presentation of
the fence .was a very nice thing for thÂ© wire company to do," at the same time
It is not so wonderful, and they should not advertise the fact In such an ob
trusive manner. Their sign was altogether, too prominent,'and'was'objection
able on that account." Then, again, there Is an ordinance which prohibits the
placing of signs in the park. The proper thing for: them to have; done. would
have been to have the Inscription placed on a cornerstone and, then;. buried,
with the usual ceremony,' or something email and neat, say about a foot long,
bearing an appropriate Inscription. This would be the proper spirit to display.
"As the matter, stands," said Mr. Stanton;- lit : looks .as â¢ though .. the . wire
company \ was looking for the advertisement and < not ; seeking . to ; beautify * the
park. Suppose Mr. Sprockets*,-. who t was kind enough -to .'donate theibeautlful
music stand, was to' have placed thereon " a "; large ; sign ; reading, : 'Presented s to
Golden Gate Park by Claus Spreckela.' This .would spoil the artistic effect and
make It simply an advertisement./ : :V' r ; . ,; ' ;;
"If the .wire works people object to the removal of the sign It shows conclu
sively that the fence was not donated In a [spirit iof public Improvementâ they
were simply seeking a 1a 1 prominent , way to advertise."' The' park- Is 'a. 'pleasure
ground." and not ; an- advertising medium. As far aa ;I am "concerned ; they, may

mRS. FISKE - MARCEAU - FEN
NELL left on the owl train last
evening for Los Angeles, whither
she goes to look after her baby
boy. Theodore Marceau Jr.. and to see
that Colonel Marceau, the little one's
father, does not take the Child out of the
State. If the colonel stands ready to ful
fill his part of the agreement of recon
ciliation Mrs. Fennell will return here
once again a wife. If not. she will de
mand that the child be placed In her
charge. No attempt will be made to make
the ex-husband fulfill his promise of mar
riage. The welfare of the child of the
separated couple is Mrs. Fenrrell'B sole
aim. If this object can be gained by a re
marriage the lady is ready to comply.
Should Colonel Marceau, however, seek to
crawl out of his part of the agreement.
sjb his denial to The Call correspondent
Wednesday and again last night of the
approaching marriage would Imply, Mrs.
Fennell will appeal to the law for the cus
tody of Theodore Jr., and the Incident, so
tsLT as the lady is concerned, will be
dosed.
Yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock Mar
ceau called Mrs. Fennell by telephone and
over the long distance wire asked her not
to believe what The Call had published
regarding his denial of their approaching
Â¦wedding.
"If you do not trust me," said the
colonel, "come right down here and you
Â¦will see that I am true to you."
Mrs. Fennell thought it somewhat
etrange that the colonel, who could not
yet have &een The Call, knew the con
tents of the message from Los Angeles
relative to himself, and so in answer to
his call for her to come and investigate
for herself ehe left last evening for the
nouthern country. Although Mrs. Fen
r.ell's departure was hasty, she did not
go unprepared to dress fittingly the part
of a bride if she Is called upon to do so.
Gowns, hats, wraps and many necessary
knickknacks of a woman's toilet were or
dered by telephone, and in the short time
of two hours the lady had purchased such
stunning additions to her wardrobe as are
apt to startle the quiet folks of Los An
geles.
While she "tried on" her various hats
and gowns Mrs. Fennell told between
her tears and sobs for her "baby boy"
and exclamations of childish delight at
the beauty of her newly acquired ward
robe the tale of how Colonel Marceau
won her second promise to be his wife.
"First of all," said Mrs. Fennell, "much
as I should like to believe what Colonel
Marceau has Just told me over the phone,
I cannot. I feel he deceived me to get
possession of our baby. When baby went
south with the colonel he agreed that I
should receive news from the child every
day. On the day of their arrival I got
a telegram and then a letter. For two
days now I have not received a word,
and that makes me feel that all Is not as
It should be."
Marceau's wooing of his ex-wife dates
back to the early days after their di
vorce. In March. 1896. Colonel Marceau
and Amanda J. Fiske-Marceau were le
gally separated. Six months later the
ex-husband forwarded the following lines
to the lady who had been his wife:
SAX FRANCISCO. Oct. IS, 1896.
My "Wife: Since your departure I have
run the gamut of every human emot||ri un
til now I have reached a state of passive
r~s!cnallon that is akin to despair. At
tlmÂ«?s I think I know, dear, that 1 grasp
the true meaninr of this act on your part,
and It seems heroic to me, and you more
than ever are my Ideal of all that Is noble
and true. I believe In your love and have
only sympathy for you In your unhapplnees.
for you must bÂ» unhappy at present. If I
can believe In the past, and I must do that
or die. Then again I think over It. and am
railed by horrible doubts that madden me.
that make eyerythtnr hateful to me, my
f*lf most of all. But. darling-, don't think
that they stay with me long. They can't
w>fn I think and remember how sweet and
adorable you 'have always been to me.
Blame you. I can not: you have given the
deathblow to my happiness, but not to my
love; that is wound less. The memory of the
past year lost and the revelation It has been
to me what life might be to me with you Is
more precious than any happiness I can
hope for in the future.
The future without you â my God. darl
ing-, it stretches out before me on a dark
ness blacker than death. If I could only
turn to son-.* one for sympathy. I feel so
helpless, so heartbroken and so homesick
for you, Hun. You can always be sure,
dearest, that I always hold you dearer than
anything or any one on earth. '
Good-by, Hun. good-by to everything that
makes life worth living-. May God bless you
and always be good to you, my wife. I am
yours, body and soul, THBO.
The later days' wooing, according to
Mrs. Fennell, was even more torrid than
the sentiments expressed in his early
epistolary efforts.
"On March 22 we met In Judge Pater-
Eon's office," said Mrs. Fennell, "and
slpned a legally drawn up agreement of
reconciliation. In this agreement I made
many concessions to Colonel Marceau,
arranging to dispose of my property In
a manner satisfactory to him. It was
the child that brought us together. When
that Interview In Paterson s office was
concluded we were all in tears. I was
crying. Colonel Marceau was crying, even
Judge Paterson was crying."
Tears played an Important role In the
ardent ex-husband's wooing and during
