the three hundred pounds, wouldn't sink.

Altogether the s big suit , was Â¦' snug and

was under water. Just at first, when the!
ringing: In my ears began, there
was that feeling that, one expe
riences when one dreams of falling;
and again upon touching the bottom it
was light, like the way one drops to the
ground In n dream.
The depth of the bay at that particular
portion was about forty feet, and there
must have been a strong outgoing Ude,
for I could feel myself floating away.fiom
the perpendicular. In a few momenta I
felt something beneath. my feet, and the
ringing in my tars stopped. \ I was on the
bottom, and the ringing had ceased with
the '.unlf ormit y of pressure on coming to
a standstill. The windows had grown
darker with the descent, and there were
only. outlines visible. Something big and
black loomed '.up beside me, and I was at
a' loss to know whether It was the hull
of a lost ship or a whale. It seemed sta
tionary; and upon reaching out my hand
I discovered it to.be a rock. Cautiously I
stooped over and touched the ground with
my hands, which were free at the wrists.
The bottom was also rock; . there . was
nothing to be picked up, not even a bit
of sand, and I had counted on an oyster
with a pearl. I grew bolder and took a
step forward. Ihe big shoes, that 1 had
not been able to move unassisted on beard
the boat, seemed fairly to jump up in the
water.
:."The fairy tale giant -with the seven-
iMfm boots earn* to my nrfrt<s.
Coming down I had determined on a sub
terranean constitutional, but after two <->r
three steps around I began to feel a llttl*
uncertain and the breathing wua difficult.
I feared to pull on the air tube for morn
air, because the natural Inference of tha
men at the line would be that I had lost
my head and was trying to get them to
draw me up. So I stood Btill until tha
breathing was easier. Something allva
wriggled under my foot, shaking the big
boot, which seemed as buoyant as a cork.
Down there the floor of the bay runs In
rocky strata. I learned this from looking
at the models of the soundings, not from
personal observation, and the strata run
In a circle around the rock, forming a
kind of merry-go-round for the seals.
I am Inclined to think I came In touch
with one of the merrymakers: something
â¢wished by me and something wlggly
touched my hand. I began to feel the
presence of sea monsters â the sort of
thing one sees In Chinese literature and
In the comlo almanacs, together with
crooked lamp posts and a dozen keyholes.
The breathing grew a little harder and I
thought how easy It would be to smother.
Before I had not realized my position and
Just what depended upon that llttla ma

of the men. I reached for the air tub*
and gave a little tug on the rubber hoÂ»eâ
the signal for more air. It came In abund

were hauling me up.
Up. up I went, thd little window* grow

my ears again. Something alive scurried
In front of the llttla window, then thera
was a glare of light and a roar, then my
head popped out of the water and I began
to get heavy againâ hopelessly and help
lessly heavy.
They dragged me up the ladder and took
off the helmet. Though there were hearty
plaudits I did not respond to the encore.
When it was all over with I began to get
frightened and to realize how much con
fidence I had placed In the sure hand of
the man at the lines, the workmen at the
pump and In the little apparatus Itself.
If that pumping machine had got out of
order, or If the air. hose had been punc
tured, or the man had misunderstood tha
signalâ but none of those things had hap
pened. i-
In reality I was some ten minutes under
water, though the time seemed but a few
moments, and there had been some forty
three feet of line let out.
As they unbuckled the shoes for me and
took off the weights there came a signal
from the barge to look outâ they were
going to shoot off a blast. There was a
strangled roar and the water came surg
ing out to the boat in Big waves.
"If you'd been down there when that
went off." said Mr. Axman. "I think you
would have known there was something
happening." The concussion In the water
was so violent that it would have been
Instantaneous death, though there was
not the slightest disturbance of the air.
"There was nearly 200 pounds of powder
In that shot." said Mr. Streets.
"Guess they'll have â¢ to keep pegging
away with shots like that till they chip It
air off," added some one else. "A llttlÂ»
thing like that doean't fease that rock ta
any extent."
"How do you get the powder to ignlta
under the water?" I asked.
"We use a kind of powder that thÂ«
water does not affect and explode It by a
jar which we bring about through the usÂ«
of electric wires." said Mr. Streets. "ThÂ«
holes are made In the rock under watei
by drilling through a cylinder or pipe, and
when the hole is deep enough we send thÂ«
powder down through the pipe, attach thÂ«
exploding apparatus and turn en the curÂ«
rent. The powder Is a special kind madÂ«
by the powder company for us and comet
in the form of a jelly so compact that thÂ«
water is not absorbed by it."

to the bottom of the bay.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Axman and

hud been given permission to go down In
the diving suit, end Captain Flanders of
the tug Lottie had allowed me a place
beelde hlsj In his little pilot-house.
When the Lottie steamed up and sidled
In beside the big floating barge which
â¢erves as hotel and storehouse for the
twenty-two men at work drilling and
blasting the rock, the men threw a big
rope o^er a wooden post of the barge and
proceeded to unload a lot of pro
visions and tobacco. On the barge
the cook was getting breakfast;
there was a reassuring odor of cof
fee and ham and a fine perspective view
of a row of pies made ready for lunch.
That was In one end of the float. The
center was taken up \ with the big boiler Â¦
which supplies the steam for the drilling.
On the other end and all around the sides
were the bunks where the men deep and
stacks of ropes and tools. I was ad-,
znonlshed to eat lots of breakfast by way
of a stimulant, but was warned against
the cook's biscuits. "There are 300 pounds
of lead on that diving suit already," said
the captain, and the cook looked resentful.
(Presently there was a big boom, a
ecurry of gulls and a rocking of the barge.
They had set off a blast. . Other than a
violent agitation of the water there did
not seem to be much visible effect. The
Old rock stood as firm and exhibited aa
little Inclination to "fly" as did the one
against whose base Roderick Dhu placed
his defiant chieftain foot.
*'31ess me," said Mr. Axman, "It would
take all the powder In Christendom to
blow that ui>."
The mÂ«n climbed out on the derrick ax
rar.gemÂ«-i;t air;iin and went to work on
the drills. The superintendents began
giving orders and taking down lists of
things needed from the shore. The cook
appeared at the door with a plate of left
over scraps of food.
"Want to iwe my poultry?" asked the
old fellow, Â£-ml!!ns. as he tossed It over
board.
There was a v.hirr of wings and a flock
of seagulls clucked down from the derrick,
skimming the water and picking up the
bits of food. On another point that jutted
out from the crater there was an assem
blage of scraggy-looking black fowls,
holding an animated session.
"TlK'in's shaÃs." volunteered a sailor.
"That's why they call this Shag Rock.
They've been roostin' here and ( holdln'
their confabs ever since the year o' 1, and
I reckon they don't like it much seeln' us
bl';\vi:/ uv ihe rock up."
Perhaps be was right, but the shags did
not seem to know what to do about it.
The discomfiture of the black fowls is
probably the necessary "evil Involved In
the "white man's burden" In this case.
YViif-n tho*e rocks are all out of the way,
with their menace to the safety of Fhips
Â«nd boats, the shags will be banished to
Al< atraz or will have to emigrate alto
gether.
At 10 o'clock the Lottie, with the diver
and his assistants, together with his ap
paiutus and his pupil on board, Steamed
round to the other side of the ro<k. An
emhor had been lost and the diver WÂ£.s
going down in search of It. taking advan

liiseoed a buoy, dropped anchor and made
the tug firm. XÂ»ext they got out a bis

on him. and the way they sounded arouna

eerious faces must have made the diver
feel a little squeamish. He eat down on
a coil of rope while they buckled on Ms

five pounds on account of the leaden soles.'
When everything was ready and the aJr
pump going properly he dragged It all.
with himself Inside of It, around to whero
the three steps of the ladder led down to
the water. Laboriously he swung him

while they Buckled another hundred
pounds of weight on his body. Then they
tied ropes around him, coiled the air tube
round his arm and secured It, arranged
the guide line, tested the air pumps,
screwed on the helmet and then dropped
him off into the water. The big canvas
rubber bag was inflated, and ' the three
hundred pounds of weight was not more
than enough to sink the diver pioperly.
The canvas Inflated and swelled cut into
the semblance of a gigantic man, there
was a swish of escaping air and then a
bubbling and he disappeared. Every one
was silent.
After a few minutes under the water
there came a tug at the air tube, the Big
nal for more air.
"Give him all the air you can," yelled
the man at the ropes to the two ut the
pump, and the machine whirred noisily.
Some ten minutes elapsed, the bubblcj
appearing in a little trail, marking the
subterranean course of the man below.
Then came the signal on the guideline to
haul up. The copper helmet with Its lit
tle glass windows presently popped out of
the water and the diver scrambled up the
ladder, announcing that the lost anchor
was nowhere in the vicinity and that they
would have to sound somewhere else. The,

that he was able to retain the favor of

Again, in IS9S, the political situation was
one that old campaigners would describe
as ticklish for Mr. Woodruff. He had
served his term as Lieutenant Governor
and he joined forces with Governor
Black to secure a renomination. It
was on the cards, however, that
Black should give way before the
hero of San Juan. Under these cir
cumstances It seemed certain that the
As a matter of fact, Mr. Woodruff has
been very successful in realizing his po
litical ambitions. Usually he has been
able to get what he wanted, and he has
walked in safely along the thorny road
of factional strife where older men and
politicians with preatT reputation for
astuteness have met their undoing. Mr.
Woodruff first dabbled in politics back In
ISSI. In the Urooklyn Mayoralty cam
paign of 'hat year and also In ISS3 he
was a. member of the executive commit
tee of the Young Republican Club, an or
ganization which enthusiastically sup
ported Seth Low and helped him to be
elected Mayor of Brooklyn. In JSÂ£5 he
was a dclepate to the Republican State
Convention, and in IS.SS he sat in the con
vention which nominated Benjamin Har
rison for the Presidency. In the follow
ing year he became a member of the Re
publican State Committee, and since that
t!mÂ» ho has been prominently and con
tinuously connected with the administra
tion of party affairs.
It was not until Mr. Woodruff had done
his full share of work as wheel horse and
leader in the party ranks that he per
mitted himself to ask for office. Then he
modestly suggested that he would like
to be a Park Commissioner, and he was
appointed. It was during hiÃ incumben

consider Mr. Woodruff's nomination on

that the opposing candidates for President
will be the name as in 183 S. and this fact
lends unusual Interest tv the question of
the men for the second place. Further
more, it is considered likely that the Re

Lieutenant Governor would share his fate,
but such was not the case- Woodruff
supported Black loyally both before and
during tho convention, but when Roose
velt had been nominated he turned. his
attention to saving his own position, and
his personal influence with the members
of tho convention was sufficient to do so,
although his nomination violated the rules
of precedent and the geographical re

Lieutenant Governor Woodruff's Wife Is His Most Valuable
Political Ally.
THE wife of Lieutenant Governor
Woodruf* is one of the very few
American women who take an active
part In helping their husbands to re
alize cherished political ambitions. It is
a curious fact that, although the United
States is the country in which women
have the best prospect of acquiring the
right to vote and to hold ofilec few Ameri
can women are interested in politics. The
wives of candidates for office seldom take
any active part in their husbands' work.
I When Mr. Woodruff first aspired to be
the leader of the Brooklyn Republicans
I Mrs. Woodruff. It Is said, suggested the
'novel method of holding a series of pollt
'ical dinners, at which the. party workers
,of high or low degree should be present.
Mrs. Woodruff herself presided at these
)affalrs and charmed the local politicians
who attended them by her tact and grace
ful attentions. She was able to talk poli
tics in a way that showed an intelligent
study of the situation, and she exercised
>all the nrt of a skilled hostess in making
her visitors feel' at ease. Opponents of
l Mr.' Woodruff referred sarcastically to
(these affairs as "pink teas," but they were
largely instrumental In securing for him
)the nomination for Lieutenant Governor.
Mrs. Woodruff's intere3t In . politics
dates back to the time wnen she was
Mies Cora Kastman. Her father was the
latÂ«: H.tG. Eastman, at onn time Mayor
of Poughkeepsie, and a man of prom
inence In the political affairs of that < ity#
In her girlhood she was accustomed to
seeing politicians meet at her father's
housf for conference and discussion, and,
it is likely that these assemblages K'-ive
her the idea which later on crystallized
in the "pink teas" and '"harmony din
ners."
Notwithstanding her interest in political
affairs. Mrs. Woodruff is not an "ad
vanced" woman, as the term is oidlnarily
understood. She is domestic In her tastes
and finds the center of her interests In
her . homo. Lest year she declined tho
presidency of the Woman's Republican
League, and she Is not what Is known as
a club woman.
Mr. and Mrs. Woodruff are remarka
blyfcongenial in their tastes. They are
equally fond of, .outdoor sportsâ driving,
bicycling and golf. They both delight in
entertaining at their home in Eighth ave
nue, Brooklyn, which Mrs. Woodruff has
made one of the most attractive in the
city. Her particular pride is the music
room, a long apartment furnished in!
Bree:i and red. This apartment and the j
adjoining dining-room. ' with Its oak
panels and .white 'enamel furnishings,
liavc been the scene of many brilliant and
fashionable gatherings. They have been
the sÂ»c<')u- of other gatherings, perhaps
less brilliant, but equally important, at
which, under the skillful -management of
Mrs. Woodruff, most of the booms which *

The school in Philadelphia is filled with
bright appearing boys and girls of ages
ip.nglng from Â»6 to 12 years. The pfioto
graphs reproduced with this article show
the method b>l which the art of speech is
taught the children. The maid who. posed
for the camera is, or was, a deaf-mute,
and her name is Ar.na d'Angells, a niece
of a famous comic opera singer, Jeff
d'Angells. She was born deaf, but Is now
one of the brightest girls In the school.
The photographs show the different posi
tions of the lips and tongue. while. Anna
d'Angells was uttering one sentence. Miss
Renhardt" asked the girl* what sentence
she. would like to say. and have It photo
graphed, and she replied very distinctly,
"I can talk." -'
The elementary syllables of this short
sentence were caught in five exposures
before the camera. Following the photo
graphic â¢ reproductions closely it will be
seen that while each syllable carries a dis
tinct mark several bear a rather close re
semblance.
The elements of which the word "I" Is
composed consist of the 1 and the c. The
mouth assumes a half-oval shape as ; thÂ«
first. half of the word is spoken. Then tha
that conferred by the wearing of many
bued waistcoats.
Â¦In addition to his, predilection for many
colored- waistcoats .Mr. Woodruff ; has
bee n_ compelled to " ' struggle against v one'
otliet. disadvantage In his political ascent
r-that Is, his youthful appearance. Some-,
body- has said that In politics there Is no
crime to equal thatof being young. Mr.
Woodruff long since, arrived at maturity,
but in spite of tbo fact that he has a
grown up son in Yale he retains his boy
ish manner and expression. '
Certainly. Mr. Woodruff possesses tho
qualities that make a man personally pop
ular among his fellows. Is not an im
pressive figure In point of stature, for he
stands only five feet seven Jnehes. What
he lacks In height is made up in girth.
He presents -a peculiarly rotund appear
ance,' and his weight Is ISS pounds, from
which it may be surmised that he amply
fills the one chief requirement of a suc
cessful waistcoat. model. His face is in
variably smiling and good natured: his
manner is genial and hearty: he puts o:i
no airs, and will entertain a ward delega
tion as carefully as he will a national com
mittee. He has a confidential manner in
talking to a man, and can ask for his vot9
in an ingenuous, of-course-you-will-do-it
way that is not easy to refuse. In splto
of the hated appellation of "dude" and
"society man," Mr. Woodruff has been
able to win his way .with all classes of
voters and politicians, and that Is no small
achievement In American politics.
It may be that Mr. Woodruff inherited
his liking for politics. His father. John
Woodruff,, represented the New Haven
(Conn.) district in Congress at the time
when the present Lieutenant Governor
was born. In 1353. When the youngster
wan seven years old both his parent* died,
and he was brought up. under the direc
tion of a wealthy: uncle. Franklin Wood
ruff. He was sent % through Phillips .Exe- ;
ter Academy.i and 'graduated from T/i'Â«
In 1873 Then? he took a brief course In
Eastman College. Poughkeepale, beforo
beginning his business career. Â¦
Whatever else this business coursa'may
have done for Mr. Woodruff, It led to his
meeting the girl he afterward marriedâ
Miss Cora Eastman, daughter of thÂ«
founder of the college.
In ISSI Mr. Woodruff entered thÂ« flna
of Nash, Whlton & Co., now thÂ« Worces
ter Salt Company, of which be- remains
the treasurer. But he did not confine
his Interests to this one concern, and
soon branched out in several directions.
He became a director of the Brooklyn
Warehouse Company, the Kings County,
Hamilton and Manufacturers' Trust com
panies, of the Merchants' Exchange Bank
and the Co-operative Bulldinjr Bank. In
ISS9 he became one of the. proprietors of &
patent malt preparation.
Mr. Woodruff's greatest enthusiasm has
been in promoting the good roads move
ment. His Interest In the subject was
aroused, no doubt, by his fondness for the
bicycle. It is an interesting commentary
<5n the man's naturalness and lack of
affectation that during his first term as
Lieutenant Governor he consented to act
as marshal of a great bicycle parade at
the head of the procession, and when he
was singled out by the Judges to receive
the prize for the best appearing rider la

honor than he had over his elevation ta
the second office In the Empire State.
)llps draw together, the tongue wedges in
.between and the "I" is there. Of course,
'as the child spoke it before the camera
a trifle more care had to be exercised than
'when the ordinary conversation was car

method was entirely successful as far aa
Khe first word was concerned.'
\ "'Can* is a difficult expression to di

Jshaped itself in a peculiar . fashion, the
tongue went toward the roof of the mouth
land 'the half-hissing sound which Issued
, was produced by the obstruction of the
organ of speech. The second part of
Â¦'."can" brought the tongue directly down
ward, but a slight difference was observed
from the position In the first word. '
In "talk," which was best illustrated, by
one exposure, a circlelike Â¦ movement cf
the lips seemed, to. swell. out the word at
once. From the throat the vowel super
seded the more lisping consonant, which
only lasted the; fraction of a second, to ap

In saying that Anna gained "her faculty
of speech," the expression la madÂ© nse oJ

HE Bohemian Club, which
â¢JL has become a popular means
of showing works of our
local painters, is also diverting the
trend of fashionable taste into an
appreciation of local subjects.
TKe spirit of distance lends en
chantment to the view had until the
past few years not only influenced
the art buyer to patronize foreign
artists, but it bezvitched him with. a
love of foreign scenes. There is
cause for devout thankfulness inthe
fact that a reaction Has set in. San
Francisco is at last becoming pat- -
riotic in its admiration of : the pic
turesque peninsula. There is no
community where nature has ever
offered a better field for art.
"I am becoming more and more
impressed, with the color relation
which exists between the sagebrush
and the sand," says Amadee Joul
lin. "Round about San Francisco
you can find every tint of sand from
brilliant white to deep yellow. I am
particularly fond of the iridescent
sands of Alameda. The exquisite

.Miss Feltram had an i lnward trembling
'sense of the near presence of Brown. His
disapproval Beemed' to cloud the bright
new plating before her eyes.'
... Was bicycling really suitable to her age
and position? She had argued "the: point
take place let them, talc* place under his eye, he
r. thought. Also, his whole soul was full of bitter
ness at having his remonstrance thus set aside* and
he . felt he could not possess it in patience In the
pantry. He honestly adored Miss Dot from the
depths of a grim and faithful old heart, and he
honestly thought bicycling entirely degratory to her
. dignity.
I*6 spectacle before him certainly lent color to
his view. ThÂ» man or woman whose first attempt
at bicycling shall be dignified has yet to be born.
Miss Feltram went through all the usual humilia
tions. " She wis pushed up on one side," pulled up
on the other. She swayed hither and thither. with
Kitty Manlsty clutching at the gathers of her skirt
and finally, after much indecision as to which side
phe should fall off, she, cast herself into Cecil Man-
Jsty's arms with a fervor not warranted â¢ by their
â¢very Â«>ay relations. Brown's groan on beholding

\, If there was one thing Brown prided himself

"So you knew Colonel Manlsty before,

growled an affirmative. Denton was young
and quick-witted, and she drew & bow at
a venture.

the Long Walk, was thrown off her

Brown feigned to be occupied with hi*
â¢upper for a moment, then he eald Tery
grimly:
"Whatever they ware, they won't be It
again. I ahall hay* a say In that, so I tell
you."
And It was the purpose conveyed In this
cryptlo remark that was engrossing
Brown'a mind now. .Fifteen years before
Colonel Mania ty had been plain. Mr. Rich
ard Manisty, and a younger son at Fer
ries, where his elder brother. Kitty and
Cecil's father, was master to-day. Fer
ries was two miles from Ftsltram Court,
and one summer, fifteen years before.
"Mr. Richard" had spent moat of his days
and hours at the. latter place. It was not
difficult to discover what brought him
there; Brown, as well as every one else.
knew well enough that he came to "see
Miss Dot." whatever his ostensible pre
texts might be.' Brown's queer old heart,
grim even in those days, thought no one
good enough for Mlsa Dot. lea3t of all "a
young lad with his work to do." So
Brown expressed the fact that Richard
Manlsty's career In the army was as yet
all before him. Suddenly there came a
day when "Mr. Richard's" comings and
goings ended. "When Brown learned that
he had "asked the master for Miss Dot."
and had been peremptorily refused by Mr.
Feltram on account of his youth, he felt
strongly If silently with his master, and
equally silently rejoiced greatly.
That was all In the past. To-day, to
Brown's mind, the whole situation had
reopened Itself and presented the old dif
ficulties. He forgot the passing of fifteen
years; he forgot the difference those yeari
had brought to both man and woman;
he forgot that his mistress was her own
mistress, too, now. nominally, at all
events, and he forgot most of all that the
whole affair did not concern him.
To him Colonel Maniaty was atlll tha
young man to whose suit Mr. Feltram
had objected, and M 133 Dot waa still a
girlâ a 'girl with no father now to guide
her erring fancies aright.
He thought and thought, pondered and
pondered. The pantry lire cracked,
sighed, fell together and went out- Not
until it was black and dead did Brown
rise and lock up the sleeping house with
the air of one who has made up hta mind.
It was the afternoon of the next day
and Brown had brought his mistress some
letters. She took them, but he did not
move; he stood at about five pace* from
her quite still. Miss Feltram. surprised
at his unusual behavior, looked up. -. Â¦'.*
â¢â¢"â¢â¢Well. Brown," she said, "do you wmnt
me?" - ';? \ "Â¦". â¢ Â¦ '
-Â¦ Brown's answer began with the phrase
which with him waa wont to be sur
charged with meaning. . . , . â¢ -
' "Am I to understand," he said, "as Col

Miss Feltram stared at him In still
deeper surprise. "I don't know." *he
said. Her voice had an unusual cold
ness in Its tones. But coldness was as
nothing to Brown. . .
"I wished to " say. Miss Dot," *he
went on, "that Colonel Manisty Isn't
changed, .not In no important par
ticular, from what Mr. Richard
y Manisty was."

Brown made a pause between each word,
partly to Rive due force to each and part
ly because the Intervals were occupied
Â¦with the arrangement of a coffee pot and i
a cup upon their silver tray. He was a .
short spare man upon whom age Â«ecmÂ«l
to have laid a shriveling rather thsn an
enfeebling touch. The fringe of hair that
purrour.dfd his non-committal baldness
was of that sandy hue over which time is I
more or less powerless. The deep lines,
â¢upon his face seemed to be mainly the re
sult of a preternatural solemnity .of ex
pression. His eyen were the watery blue of :
old age. but their glance. If slow, was as
shrewd as that of a young man.
"Lor", Mr.. Brown, what things you do
say:"
The comment came from Miss Feltram s '
maid, who was standing by Brown's r-nn
try fir*- Denton was a young woman,
who. as ehÂ« phrased It, "enjoyed a little
chat."
"And what may that mean In English,
now?" she added. " 'Tlsn't English, by
the sound of It." .
"No." -\ Â¦
Brown spoke with grim superiority. HÂ« j
was at that moment making the coffee, a.
task he would give to no other hand.
"It's Latin," he went on as he put the
coffee pot down. "And It meansâ lt means
a deal; In especial it means I'm going to
let Miss Dot understand my mind about
this bicycle Jarres brought. I can't htve
Miss Dot bicycling: it's not a fit thing for
Miss Feltram to do: I won't have her go
bicycling out of Feltram Court, and that's
the fact."
Brown's was not the type of mind that
moves with the times. It held few ten
ets, but the firmest consisted of the the
sis that every invention to which the mini
of man had attained since he himself had
arrived at maturity was an Invention from
xrhich no good could possibly come. He
disapproved of the telegraph; he disbe
lieved la the telephone. He looked upon
en express train as a new-fangled crot
chet, and he Â«?garded a bicycle as a ma
chine calculated to wreck the very foun
dations of society.
"Won't you?" said Denton. laughing.
"You think you've a deal of a say with
Miss Feltram. Mr. Brown, you do."
"I have," said he, calmly, "And I mean
to have."
"She's as well lntentioned a mistress as
ever I wish to have," said Denton. "But
the meekest has a way of her own, end
you mark me, Mr. Brown, you won't have
your say forever; that's what I think."
Brown only answered this by a dissent
lent cough and the clatter of a cup. -;
Meanwhile Miss Feltram was sitting in
her own rather stately dining-room, which
had remained unchanged to all Intents anl
purposes, ever since she could remember.
She was Just a trifle nervous. It waÂ« not
easy to say how the fact betrayed itself,
for hers was not a physique which lent it
self readily to signs of discomposure.
She was a very handsome woman:
though she was nearly 37 there was no
touch of gray in her thick black hair. It
was drawn softly back from her forehead,
leaving only a few little curls to soften the
outline. In a way which â¢ added to ! her
height and to the effect of dignity pro
duced by a very well shaped and well
poised head. She had particularly bright
dark eyes, a pleasant mouth always ready
to curve Into a smiltf. and a clear dark
complexion, against which the level line
of her eyebrows stood out with an effect
which gave an added character to J her
Jace.
The remains of a banana lay on her
p'.ate and she was carefully cutting It Into
small squares as if the fate of nations de
pended upon the accuracy of this action.
Ard herein, perhaps, lay the one sign of
the nervousness which culminated in a
slight start as the door opened. â¢ "
Brown came up to his mistress, held
the tray while she poured out her coffee,
tthen put it on the table and withdrew a
step or two so that he stood facing her,
respectful, servant-like In every line of
his black-clad figure.
Miss Feltram began to play with her
teaspoon. Apparently she found matter
I for study in her own crest as displayed
thereon. .Â¦*Â»Â¦'Â¦â¢Â¦'
"Well. Brown," she said, at length, "la
there any news to-night?'.'
Br^wn shook his head. His natural
solemnity of demeanor was accentuated.
"Not that I'm aware of. Miss Dot," he
raid, and then he paused. The pause was
fu!l of portent.
Miss Feltram. eipped her coffee with de
liberation.
"Oh. by the by," she said with an as
sumption of having been struck by a sud
den thought which would not have de
ceived an ir.fant and obviously did not
deceive Brown, "has James come back
from the -station?"
"He have. Miss Dot." < Â¦ "*

"There were sime seeds for the garden

"Ah. yes," she said, "that's right. I'm
glad it's come. Did I tell you. Brown, I
can't remember, that I'm going to take to

to btgin. they tell me. The roads are so
rice and it won't be too hot tor a long .
time yet."
"Am I to understand as you know how
to do it. Miss Dot?"
Brown's tone was such as to convey un
mistakably that to his mind the knowl
edge of the art of bicycling was even a
blacker fault than the possession of a bi
cycle. Miss Feltram felt the subtle degra
dation she was undergoing and faltered.
"Well, not yet." she said humbly. "I
ousnt to have taken to it long ago," she
added, growing bolder. "Miss Manlsty
and Mr. Cecil are coming to-morrow to
give me my first lesson. I shall soon

"Do you think co. Miss Dot?" Â«ald
Brown. There was a respectfully veiled

passed to the only form of defense she
could think of.
"And then, you see." she said. "It will
be an Immense convenience. One may not
always want to have the horses out. Be- '
sides, one can go such long distances. Mlsn
Manisty and her brother think nothing of
sixty miles a day. They go like the
wind!"
"Am I to understand that you are think- ,
Ing of going sixty miles in a day. Miss
Dot? And -on them two wheels?"
Brown's tone was perfectly respectful. ,
No one could have accused him at any <
time of taking a liberty with his mis
tress; but there was that in his tone and
manner which reduced blcyling to the
level of a nursery entertainment for chil
dren of impaired Intellect.
"I do not think." he added with the
solemnity belonging to Intense convic

"there would be no danger except that of

"Oh no," he replied, "these little valves

V WAS onÂ« of the barkeepers. Out
1 upon the floor men and women were
| Caneing: at the bar men and women
JL were <?rlnk'.r.g. The barkeepers, each
with a white apron, were busily en
paged in filling: large glasses with
beer and setting black bottles on the dent
ed bar. Their make-up was simpleâ a
sweep of the hair, plastered down over
the forehead, a low collar, a parti-colored
vest and the aforementioned apron. At
titude â one of nonchalance. Speech â quick
end to the point.
Tending har is pimple enough in itself,
as everything is taken straight on the
Barbary. even to the absinthe. There are
r.o dainty decoctions, no Willie-boy drinks
to be found there. The work of a bar
keeper is manual labor, but he is mon
arch of all he surveys. He ejects, re
jects and inflects all v.ith equal empha
tic; the cynosure of all eyes in his im
mediate vii inity. The settler of all dis
putes.. His word is law. Arbitration is
rot in his vocabulary. The open door

The place was small and dincy: sand
was on the fioor. and above lamps, with
Kackened chimneys, swung in the tobacco
tmoke. Here and there were round ta
bles, some with green tops and brass
tacksâ axi alluring sight to the gambler.
One end of the room was swept clean for
dandsig. and at the other end. to one
tide, stood the bar. with gaspipe trim
mings.
Behind the bar and at an angle hung a
mirror â soap-marke<i with Christmas
greetings, underlined and grouped about
with bunches of grapes, also done in soap,
mur h to the admiration of those whose
artistic instincts have been somewhat
hampered by this sordid environment. The
celling was low and black. The small
latticed doors swung to and fro. handled
Impatiently by the thirsty ones entering
end roughly by the satiated ones going
out. A little red light flickered outside,
fanned by the swinging of the doors. The
musicians, two In number, kept up an
Incessant vibration, the main object be
ing-, seemingly, to begin and end the tune
at the same time. Now the violin would
be ahead, the little, fat body of the vio
linist swaying back and forth In his chair,
his <?yes bloodshot and the patched ends
cf his shoe beating a continual tattoo.
Now the piano would tinkle, tinkle, rum
ble, the pianistâ lean, hungry, gaunt
doubled up over the keys, his long, bony
fingers, like the claws of a buzzard, trem
ulously, nervously striking the notes, his
hair dangling In his eyes.

the tables, Â»ome talking, some laughing.

Fight, the men none. The men were the
kind that are ordinarily seen along the
water front and the darker alleys of the
tenderloin, scuffling and crowling along,
dodging In and out of dark corners and,
floors that you never knew were thereâ
men unshaved, unkempt and unsung, who
are born to live and die without leaving
an Impress on this busy world of ours,
not even a grave.
Over by the door sits a man with a
stubby white board, eyes sunken, and
there is an unnatural brightness to them;
lips that are thick and chin that recedes.
He sips nervously at his little glass of
greenâ his life, his allâ absinthe.
With his chair tilted back against the
wall, in easy indolence, sits one who is
big and fat, whose face looks red through
the network of purple veins so distinct
upon his puffed eherks and nose. He
seems content; with hands clasped, thumb
to thumb, over^his greasy vest.
Round and round went the dancei^ in a
mad and dizzy whirl. Square danc*s â
never: they are considered a waste of en
ergy, time and music. It is generally a
waltz, sometimes a galop and then again,
by the higher stratum, "de mazuke." But
all have the inevitable glide and dip.

surface of the bar. The other two left
him to his fate, a fate as Inevitable as
the setting of the sun. It was upon him
soon. The strong arms of the bouncer
went about him and then he was lifted,
his body limp as that of a dead
man, and hurled through tha door,
which closed instanter behind him. Thera
was a dull, heavy thud outside. Tha
bouncer never turned a hair. What be

Is no affair of ours.
"De spoit is Just beginnln'." said she of
the twisted Jersey as she borrowed a light.
Then placing her head between her hands
and her elbows on the bar she blew me a
puff of smoke and asked. "Say, ain't you
de mark that used to sling for de Palm
Leaf on Fourth street?" I dived down be
hind the bar to look for something which I
knew was not thereâ l wanted to get that
language straightened out. After some
little fumbling, both physically and men
tally. I arrived at the conclusion that she
meant to aak me if I had ever served
drinks at the above-mentioned saloon.
"Chure your dead next." said. I. trying
to do as the Romans did.
"I tought so." answered sheâ fllokln*

of the card machine. "I tumbles when I
blows In here to-night. I knows yera

The girl in the twisted Jersey, had fin
ished her dance and straightway walked
with her partner, a sailor man three seas
under, to the bar, calling again for a gin
and soda. Her partner mumbled some
thing. A mumble is always interpreted
as a desire for whisky on the Barbary-
The barkeeper set out the bottles and
glasses. The girl poured hers with an
accustomed naivete. The man's hand
shook and the neck of the bottle rat
tled against the glass. The girl swal
lowed hers In a gulp. The man upset
the glass, contents and all, upon the floor.
The girl took a yellow check from tha
man at the end of the bar. and leaving
the sailor man to croon a song over his
loss, set about looking for another part
nerâfor each dance means a drink and
each drink means twelve and one-half
cents for the girl if she can find a man
to dance and drink with her.
And when the lights commenced to
grow low and when there was more bead
than beer In the glasses. I asked the girl
what she thought of life, anyway.

With this parting admonition he left mo
and helped himself abstractedly to a
drink. Portuguese Joe I found out by dint
of conversation with the bouncer .to be
lomewhat of a terror along the coast. A
sailor by trade and a landsman by selec
tion. His facÂ« bore every evidence of a life
of dissipation, and there was a gleam from
the two little beady eyes that would keep
you walking in the middle. of the street
all the way home. The old man next him,
Comstock Pete, was bent .with age. His
clothes, mere rags collected here and there
from,' places not sacred to the ragman,
hung limply about. him. His. beard, gray
and . ; unkempt, hung down over his soiled
and greasy shirt ', and his ; hands, -cracked
and- creased with the .wrinkles of; age,
clung tightly to his glass. And yet this

STRANGE SCENES THE BARKEEPERS WITNESS
AND QUEER CHARACTERS THEY MEET.ft T feems hard that a man must be dead
for fifty year? before his fame shall
i! reach Its zenith, yet such is the case
with the work of Honore de Balzac. It
Is so with nearly all frreat men of Renlus.
Balzac, it is true, made large sums of
money from his writings and received
much praise during his lifetime, but it
â¢was all as nothing compared with the
universal approval of his work at the
jirefent day. As literary gems and finan
cial plums his masterpieces are now pro
nounced as closely approaching perfec
tion. For example, word eorr.es that with
the subscription aecnts his "ready pale
rivals that of Kipling, which should be
fiatterirsg to the prtat Mr. Kipling, for Bal
zac writes as Kij>!ingr never will; and with
regard to literary standard the critics
of to-d.ny Fir.g loudly his praises. Pro
fessor Harry Thurston Peck, who is
f-omething of an iconoclast in his way,
even offers him glad approval; of course
lie has to give Shakespeare a rap with
c>->ld chisel and hammer to do this, but
then wo rntiFt always smash one idol to
j>u: another In its place; pedestals are
too expensive to allow critics to have two
Mo!s aloft at the same time. He says:
"My own belief is that at the last his name
will be placed higher Ftill than Shakes
peare's, at the very apex of the pinnacle
at literary fame." Mr. George Moore also
made an assertion to the same effect. The
top rung of the ladder of fame Is a plat
form; there is plenty of room for all
when once there, the only difficulty being
the long climb. Shakespeare and Balzac
are both on the platform, so why make
trouble between the gentlemen?
Â¦ â¢ * â¢ Â¦; â¢
Ba!zac"has done some wonderful work
remarkable enough to make even his
most casual reader interested in the life
and personality of the man. In no way
can a man's character and opinions bÂ»
better read than through the letters writ-
Ten by him to the woman he loves. True,
It does sc-em that a man's personal corre
epouiJence should be exempt from the
profanation of the public eye; but euch
a genius as that of 13alzac becomes after
his death in a measure public property.
AYe all feel as thoueh we had an Interest
in him. That is one way of looking at It;
nr.d In any event 1 think not many read
ers will be hold from reading Katharine
Prescott Wormelry's translation of Bal
zac's letters to Mme. Hanska merely on
account of moral scruples of that nature.
In fact, the rea'W will regret that ha
cannot have also the letters from Mme.
Hanska to Balzac.
These letters from Balzac to Mme. Han
ska cover a iieriod of thirteen years and
are a novel In themselves. Mme. Hanska
Â¦was born Countess Kvelina Itzewuska and
Bt the time of her first correspondence
â¢with Balzac was 2i or US yearÂ« old and
the wife of Monsieur Hanr.ki. The letters
thow the devoted but respectful admira
tion of an ardent lover and were written
vith The entire approval of Monsieur
Har.Fla. all of which reveals an apparent
ly inexplicable state of affairs," indeed, but
one that can b<- easily comprehended by
reading the letters themselves. To prop
erly appreciate them one should be fa
miliar with the life of Balzac.
Ba!zÂ«c was Dot a man who sprang Into
.prominence at once. He wrote quantities
of â¢Â¦s-tufT' before he developed into the
I'alzac that we know to-day. Born at
Tours May 16. 1735. he went to Paris in
2Sl* and studied law for three years at
the request of his practical father. He
Then chose writing us a profession and
â¢was given a meager allowance with two
years' probation, lie v.Tote a tragedy on
Cromwell which was accepted by his par
ents as a flat failure and he was as'ted
to retire from the literary field. Here his
lÂ»or>everance. so strong in his after life.
came to the fore and he decided to stand
by his chosen pursuit; so lie went hack
to an attic and with no allowance get
to work to make a living by liis pen alone.
He turned out five dramas, with only one
fairly successful. He v.Tote ten romances
for cheap booksellers between 1522 anil
3)-nÂ«. all very poor. In 1527 came a finan
cial collapse. He had gone Into a pub
lishing business, had failed and was"
heavily la debt. Here he was, 2S> years
oid and owing ]f>o,</>0 francs.
But he had had txpe-riences nbich
proved Invaluable to him in weaving the
plots and delineating the characters
wh!i"li were to bring him lasting fame, lie
possessed the intuition and penetratiin of
the born psychologist and the stubborn
faculty of never bending to a storm of
111 luck.
In IS3O he decided that pomething must
be done, and that quickly. This period
marks the beginning of his great li'erarv
activity. L4ke Homer, Chaucer and
Shakespeare, his characters became living
persons to him. He would even hold con
versations with them as he walked .-.long
the street. Eighteen hundred and Ihlrty
marks the beginning of his most prolific
period. It was then he accepted Mine.
Hanska as his ideal, and her Influence had
the greatest effect upon his subsequent
vork. Their correspondence wa3 begun in
a romantic manner. Miss Wormeley says:
"The simple etory of these letters Is a*
follows: In February. 1533, Balzac re
ceived a letter, posted in Russia, from a
'lady who signed herself TEtrangere'
(Foreigner). This letter is not known to
exist, nor is there any authentic knowl
edge of Its contents; but it began a cor
respondence between Its writer and Bal
rae which ended In their marriage In ISGO.
It does not appear at what date Madame
Haneka gave her name; it muet have
been quite early in the correspondence,

These letters show more of Balzac than
could be told by any other pen than his,
for they are himself.
A few In the present volume are trans
lated under protest and are undoubtedly
not Balzac's, or are filled with Interpola
tions, probably doctored up by M. le
Vlcomte de Bpoelberch de Lovenjoul for
the purpose of establishing the elander
suggested In his book, "Roman d' Amour."
Such stuff as the following we certainly
must hope wa* not written by so great a
mind as Balzac's:
To-flsr, my flower cf fc^a-ren, I send yon a
lock cf my hair; It la still black, but I hasten It
to defy time. I am letting my hair crrow, and
people aÂ«k why. Why? Because I want enough
to make you chains and bracelets!
You are in all ray thoughts. In all the lines
I write. In all the moments of my Ufa. In all
xny being, in my hair that is growing for you.
Adieu: I- have no flowers this time, but I
tend you the end of a cedar match I have been
chewing while I write. I hayÂ» given It a
thousand klsers.
Miss Wormeley offers ample proof to
convince the most skeptical that these
lines and similar passages In some of the
other letters are interpolations and for
that matter the reader is forced to the
came conclusion from the marked char
acter and style of the genuine epistles.
How different are the following lines
and how true they ring of the hand of
Balzac:
It is a gloomy evening. I am seated at my

"Indian Story and Song "
' "Indian Story and Song" is a book of
aboriginal f-br.gs which* have hitherto ap
peared only In scientific publications. At;
the Congress of Musicians, held_ at the,
Trans-Mlssisslppi Exposition in' Omaha,
July. 183S, so much interest was taken In
the essays of Alice Fletcher upon the
songs of the North American Indians that
a number of them arc herewith presented
in their matrix of story.
-' To a student of archaeology they are of
i great value. Many of them have a com
mon motif and -are' parts of one cere
monial action, but the motif is treated
differently in each song.
Their brevity Is noticeable. They. have
no Introduction, being almost abrupt. This
Is owing to the relation of the' song to
some story, for the latter Is always found
ed upon a dramatic circumstance.
'Every song had originally It 3 owner; be
longing cither to a society, secular or re
ligious ; to a certain clan or political or
ganization, or to some individual. Each
society had its peculiar songs, as also the
individual ; and only by . purchase could
the right to : sing be transferred. There
was no important personal experience
where It did not play a part, nor. a cere
monial . where it was | not essential to the
expression of religious feeling." This was
because of, a belief that music was a me
dium of communication between man and
the unseen. -Therefore the Indian used his,
song In every experience from the cradle
to the grave to Insure the assistance of
the unseen power, when confronted by any
undertaking, such aa war, < the, hunt for
game, for sport or for 10ve. .; He sang not
as our modern tenor clamoring for ap
plause, but. poured out. his feelings re
gardless of artistic effect. . -
Indian ) singing was Â¦ always in unison,
and as the several voices moved along in
octaves- the different qualities, of tone pro
duced harmonic effects. There is no uni
form key for any particular song, for the
Indian has no mechanical device by which
he can determine pitch.
Among the songs in this collection Is 'a
stirring dance song, which, like all the
others, has beenharmonlzed by Professor
J. C. Fillmore. It is light and spirited
and is the call .of the people to /their
leader, Ishibuzzhi. v' .
One which might be called rather flow
ing ,in style is a trystlng love song. The
words, "I see them coming," are sung by
a youth .who awaits his Indian lass, and
to her it is the fulfillment of hope and,
love. i~^BHiMiiWÃffiKS^BffyfflSf^T^te l flÃ
The Song of. the Deathless Voice is per
haps one of the most stirring sung. It is
in a majestic . and martial spirit \ and re
counts - the experience of - a number of
warriors and their leader who went forth
to } harass 'Â¦ and drive r a powerful people
from a territory rich in game. '
One day, they ; came .to - a': large grove,
where they pitched camp that they might
rest a while. Some went forth for game,
while j others watched* and repaired their
moccasins and clothing. < : Night came ! on,
and while those whose duty, it was to cook
were busily preparing the meal others! sat
before the burning logs and told stories of
battles and strange Â¦ adventures. Â¦ -

about which you know nothing. This work,

Â¦Walter Bcott . wrote two novels a year, and
â¢was thought to have luck In his labor; he as
tonished England. This year I shall have pro
auced: (1) "LÂ« Per* Gorlot." (2) "I* LyÂ» DanÂ»
la Vallee." (S) "Lea Memolres fl'une Jeune

three parts of the "Etudes de Moeure". for
Madame Bechet. and three parts of the "Etudes
rhllosophiques" . for W'erdet. And, finally, I
rhall have finished the third dizain and "Ser
aphita." But. then, shall I be living or tn my
sound mind In 1536? I doubt It. Sometimes I
think that my brain is Inflaming.' I shall dte
on the breach of intellect. These efforts hayÂ«
not yet saved me from my. financial crisis.
This fearful production of books. Involving; as
It doen fuch masses of proofs, has not sufficed
to liquidate roe. . I must come 'to the stag*,, the
returns of which are enormous compared to
those we get from books. The intellectual bat
tlefields are more fatiguing to work than the
fields where men die or the fields where they
sow their corn: know this. France drinks
brains, as once she cut off noble heads.
I am much fatigued, much tortured, much

Like nearly all men of genius he had
his weaknesses and fads. He was erratic
and egotistic He had no business head
and was always filled with â¢ grandiose
schemes by which he hoped to eventually
surround himself with all the luxuries of
wealth. Bric-a-brac and antiquities were
his special hobby; while he believed firmly
in somnambulism, mesmerism and hyp
notism. Ho cultivated long hair, lost
money in stocks and carried a most re
markable . cane of , which he was -very
proud.' Regarding the cane what he has
to say to Mme. Hanska on the subject is
Interesting and well shows his ebullient,
boyish nature:
I will put In my parcel of April 17 tfet two

one's Â«lf for having wasted one's timeâ thÂ«
precious stuff of which life Is made. It Is not
fo that we reaih the last page cf a novel of

but superior and admitting more dialogue. . lie
Is full of bourgeols^ld'as. He execrates Racine
and conxtd^ri him" a secondary . man.- He Is
crazy in that direction. There is more cf good
than of evil in him. Though the good Is an out
come of vanity, and though all things are
deeply calculated in him, he is. In the main, a
charming man, besides being the great poet
that he Is. He has lost much of his quality,,
his force and his value by the life he leads.
Balzac's opinion of himself, as brought
out In one of the epistles, presents a very
accurate estimate of his character:
I have told you something of my life; I have
not told you nil, but you will have seen enough
to understand that I have no time to"Uo evil,
no leisure to let myself go t.i happiness. Gifted
with excessive sensibility, having lived much
in the solitude, the constant ill-fortune of my
life haÂ» been the element of what Is called no
Improperly talent. I am provided with a great
power ot observation, because I have beÂ«n cast
among all sorts of professions involuntarily.
The foregoing excerpts give a very fair
average of the Interesting points of the
Balzac letters as translated by Miss
Wormeley. W. P. Trent, In a recent ar
ticle upon Balzac literature, says with ref
erence to these epjstles and their char
acter and value:
"They are not spiritual documents, like
the Browning letters,' or documents deal-
Ing with" the amenities of friendship and
social life, like the Stevenson letters, and
it may be doubted whether, in transla
tion, they would appeal to one-tenth of the
readers that have recently been fascinated
with these two epistolary collections: Yet
they set before us a far greater man than
either Browning or Stevenson, and their
value will Increase with the years."
Too much cannot be said of the thorough
and praiseworthy work which Miss Wor
meley has done In this book./ She Â¦; pre
sents in addition numerous footnotes of
great value to the lover of Balzac, and
also translations of several letters from
Monsieur Hanski, together with other In
formation by way of explanation or neces
sary to complete the chain of the author's
correspondence. (Hardy, Pratt A Co.,

Mr. Treland has spent the greater part
of twelve years In the. British colonies.and
the present volume shows the hand of one
familiar' with his subject. The author,
however, is decidedly pro-British in his
sentiments and many bits of evidence Ken
erully considered of Intrinsic worth from
a Boer standpoint are cither wholly omit
ted or slightingly passed over.
In Mr. Ireland's review he divides the
history of South Africa into six periods:
1 (1) From the final British occupation of
Capo Colony in 1814 to 1532, the year in
which the Trar.svpal became a separate
state. (2) From 1852 to 1557, the year .in
which England resumed sovereignty over
Ihe Transvaal. (3) The revolt of ISSO and
the conventions of ISSI and ISSI. (4) The
growth of the Uitlander grievances since
the re-erection of the Transvaal In ISSI.
(5) The Jameson raid. (6) The Interfer
ence of Great Britain In order to secure
redress for the Uitlander grievances.
The author candidly admits and cites
instances of British ignorance and mis
management In the affairs of the Trans
vaal, blaming high offlclalsfof the past
and present for the wars whi*i have been
as well as the existing difficulty. He
warmly espouses the cause, of the Ultland
ers, however, taking up strongly the ques
tion of taxation without representation;
their educational and political grievances
and outrages on person and property.
Mr. Ireland presents his arguments in a
concise and readable form. His book Is not
long and is well worth' reading if taken

author having a pro-Boer, tendency and
who dwells on the arguments omitted In

watched with keen Interest by reason of
the fact that It sets out to be the literary
organ of society â that element of civiliza
tion that is usually supposed to be with
out brains. As a matter of fact, the first
number of "The Smart S?t" Is a startling
refutation of this conventional theory, in
that It Is brilliantly written from start to
finish, and the contributors of social re
nown ho.d their own with those whose
fame is distinctly literary. "The Idle
Born," the leading feature of the number,
is by H. C. Chatfield-Taylor and Reginald
,de Koven, and is a fierce travesty on their
own set. Other contributors are Mrs.
Burton Harrison, Julien Gordon (Mrs.

Julian Hawthorne, Edgar Saltus and Ella
Wheeler Wilcox. The magazine is hand

An experiment of great Interest to read
ers of the Bible-Is announced by the Mac
mlllan Company.- They will publish Im
mediately, in current and popular Eng
lish, the epistles of the New Testamenjt.
The work has been done by Rev. Henry
Hayman, D.D., rector of Aldlngham, Eng
land, Honorary Canon ot Carlisle. The
author's plan has been to keep with the
mose careful fidelity to the thoughts of
the apostles, while claiming a perfectly
free hand as regards the language In
which he has ventured to present them.
In the latter respect he reverses the prac
tice of every earlier version in our lan
guage, but the departure is Justified by
the changes that have taken place in our
native tbngue. The result will be found
to be very helpful in the understanding of
the -epistles. The authorized version Is
printed on the left-hand pages and the
modern English on the right.
. The evolution of the wholesale distrib
uting house into a publishing factor has
received its latest exemplification in the
case of the H.B. Claflln Company of New
York. Early last year the management
conceived the idea of issuing the expen
sive copyright works of popular authors in
moderate price editions. Beginning with!
a limited edition of 100,000 copies of "The
Honorable Peter Stirling," by Paul Lei
cester Ford, the clever author of the pres
ent favorite "Janice Meredith," they Is
sued in rapid: succession ,"The Forest
Lovers," by * Maurice Hewlett; "Tekla,"
by Robert Barr; "A Lady of Quality,"
by Mrs. Burnett; "Trilby." by George dv
Maurier; "Adventures of ' Francois," by"-
S. Weir Mitchell, etc., etc.
The experiment proved to be a complete
success, . the editions, necessarily limited,
being rapidly exhausted. The same policy,
it Is announced, will be continued into
1900.

that it is at last ready. The Authorized
English translation is by ;Mrs. Louise
Maude. This edition is the only one au
thorized by Count Tolstoi, the transla
tion having been made " from his manu
script and under his direction.
Â¦ "Resurrection" Is the only long novel
written by Count Tolstoi since "Anna
Karenlna." It -is most 'dramatic, vivid
and realistic In its study of character and
delineation of Russian life of the present
day. It is a story of the resurrection of
two souls and embodies the author's views
as .to the brother hood . of man. the im
morality of r many of the political condi
tlons *of the time ! and his implicit belief
in the teachings of, the New Testament.
The Russian edition is emasculated.
Mr. R. H. Russell, the publisher, will
shortly start a monthly periodical, which,
unless a more promising title suggests It
self, will be called The New Magazine.
This publication will probably make its
bow to the public with its May number.
It will conform in slzÂ» to the standard
American monthly. Its contents will be
principally short fiction, with a few seri
als. The best artists have been engaged
to make the Illustrations, and the most
approved methods will be employed In col
oring; many of the pictures. Besides the
fiction an effort will be made to carry
features which may be said to be identi
fied with a "monthly, newspaper" In text
as well as Illustrations.
Some of the English critics hare fallen
foul of the dialect of Mr. Dociey. which

tives have enthusiastically approved its
accuracy.

the one Issued in London. The forthcom

v^als the great mind and foul behind it
all. Here is, as Mlbs Wormeley says, "one
of his rare revelations of the soul of his
work:"
If you only knew how, after this solitary life.
I lone to grasD Nature by a rapid rush across
Europe, how my soul thirsts for the immense,
the Infinite; for Nature seen in the mass, not
in detail. Judged cm its grand lines, sometimes
damp with rain, sometimes rich with sun. as
we bound across Fpace. seeing lands Instead of
villages! . If you knew this you would not tell
me to come, for that redoubles my torture; it

Balzac had innumerable financial
troubles, but through them all he never
for one moment allowed business diffi
culties or his poor health to Interfere
with the gigantic labors of his pen. He
had one friend, one Ideal, to whom he
confided everything, and that one was
Mme. Hanska. His letters to her give
the best idea of haw he worked and pre
sent most clearly the remarkable per
sonality of the man. Witness the follow
ing:
Here I rm. once more as poor as Job, and
yet t^is week I must find 1200 francs to settle
another lltieious affair. Oh! how dearly is
fame bought: How difficult men make It to
acquire bsr. No, there is no such thing as a
cheap creat man.

has caricatured all the great men. The chief
point of mine Is the famous cane bubbling; with
turquoise oh a chased sold knob, which baa

As for me, he has caricatured my stoutness.
I look like Louis XVIII. These two carica
tures have had such great success that I hayÂ»
not as yet been able to 'get them. It is true
that I bo out little. and sit at my work for
twenty hours. Ton can't imagine what suo
eers thl3 Jeweled 'cane has had; it threaten* to
become Euroaean. Borcet, who has returned
from Italy, and who did not say he was my
friend, told me he heard of it in Xaoles and
Rome. All the dandles In Paris are Jealous,
and the little Journals have been supplied with
items for six months. Excuse me for telling
you this, but it seems to me it is biographical,
and if they tell you on your, travels that I have

palaces and i>plts diamonds, do not be sur
prised, but laugh as I do. Never did the tall of
Alclblades' dog was; harder. .But I have three
or four tails of the sama kind for the Paris

Balzac was most frank in his expres
sions to Mme. Hanska regarding con
temporary authors, with many of whom
he had a personal acquaintance. What
he thought cf Dumas and Hugo may not
prove uninteresting:

surpassing Interest and pages will be
given to it. The hackney, the French
coach horse and the heavier breeds will
receive attention and the second histori
cal number will prove Just as Instructive
as this one. Finally all the matter will
be revised and bound In one great
volume." 'Â¦'â¢Â¦'
The present edition Is a condensation of
all the principal facts relating to the his
tory of the horse and Is a clean, terse rec
ord of the progress made by American
breeders. The volume is profusely illus
trated with excellent photogravures of
prominent horsemen, of their model
stables and of famous stallions, brood
mares and race horses.

the sky as an offering to that mysterious
power. Suddenly through, the Btillness
there rang a song, the echoes In the hills
and valleys "catching and repeating â¢ the
strain. Each man grasped his bow while
the leader exclaimed, "The fire, the fire!"
At once many hands were rubbing the
flaming wood into the earth. The leader
hastily . commanded his men to form a
ring around the spot whence came the
song, and while the voice stng on the ring
became smaller and smaller until in an
open space the shadowy form of a tree
loomed, up. The song : went . on unceas
ingly, until the tree becoming plainly vis
ible there could be no chance of escape for
the singer. The Indians kept their bow 3
drawn and arrows strung while they
slowly closed In. The song ceased, but no
human being could be seen. Instead at
the bottom of the tree lay scattered the
whitened bones and grinning skull of a
man. Death had claimed the body of the
warrior, but had failed to silence the voice
of the hunter, who when living had often
defied death.
In the book each song is given with the
Indian words and is arranged for piano
accompaniment. . There is also presented
a short explanation and the legend con
cerning the origin of the melody. Miss
Fletcher's work will prove very charming

and crushing it. Their teeth are
like long needles so turned in diag
onally that 'when they begin to
swallow a bird or an animal they have
to keep at it. They have a heap of saliva
that flows over their prey as it progresses
into the snake's mouth. That eases the
swallowing: operation. The rattler's jaws
can be unhinped in some way and their
flesh is flexible, so they can get their
mouths over objects many times larger
than themselves. My snake Doctor one*
got to swallowing a big ground squirrel
too. large for him. He would have died
if Dan hadn't happened to see his distress
and came and helped him get the animal
out. I've found over a dozen dead rat
tlers with a quail or some other bird or
animal in their jaws too large to go into
the snake's mouth. Other men in the
mountains tell me they have found snakes
the same way.
"How long after the venom of rattle
snakes gets in the blood of animals does
it produce death?" asked the reporter, i

"Another thing that the natural history

telling a rattler's age by Its rattles. Now,
I've got in a wire cage in my snakrÂ» farm
two snakes that Dan caught about two
years ago. They were about ten inches
long â¢ then, and I know they had never
tasted food. I fed them a ground mouse

their tails. Go out and see for yourself, if
you don't believe my words, and you'll ob

five on the other. Dan and I believe they
will have several rattles more thts year.
I used to have a rattler, which I finally
killed for his oil and skin. He was a ter
irlble.fast grower. He grew from two feet
to over four feet long In one year. I
know he wasn't over four years old when
I killed him. yet he had eight or nine rat
tles. He is about the average rize of a
California rattlerâ that Is, four foot and
two Inches. When I was In the Union
army I saw lots of Texas rattlers In the
Panhandle of Texas that I'll bet were over six
W feet long. Say, once I got a rattler in the Pu

twenty-seven rattles. Whew, what a racket ha

of old Abe Lincoln, being In Los Angeles. I have
always thought old Abe the biggest and best man

I thought I would take those wonderful rattles
down as a present to old Abe's boy. I stayed
around the Westminster Hotel all one morning,
and a man told me that Mr. Lincoln would â¢xm
come In from a ride. He came back at noon,
and he was pointed out to me. So I walked
right up to him as he steered threugh the crowd

skins only once a year. But I've
never caught on to just how snakes
get the skin cff. I've, gone to bed
at night and left 'Doctor' without his
showing any more signs of peeling him
self than if he'd been a stick of wood, but
In the morning his old clothes would be
lying in one corner of the cage and he'd
be as bright as an old-fashioned patch
work quik in his new ones.
"Lots of folks all over the world be
lieve that when a rattlesnake Is shedding
his skin he Bets blind. There is no mis
take that his ryes do get covered with a
bluish lilm at that time, but just pin a
mouse In his cage and see how quick he
will coil up and s?nd for it and hit it in
the neck every time. I've done it hun
dreds of times.'; A ) rattlesnake always
strikes for the reck, and ho always
strikes his prey before he eats it; but you
may fill his cage with rats or mice or
frogs or anything else he likes, and hell
never touch one of them unless he's hun
gry. He kills only enough for one meal,
and when that is swallowed anything and

Jump on him and tumble

"Another thingâ a rattler never
eats until his digestive machinery if
empty. I've cut open snakes "and
found the stomach empty when I had
seen them hunting for something to
eat, and I've watched Doctor more

A mouse every other day will make

Until starting upon this American tonr
he has been actively engaged upon his
Polish opera, which will be produced at
Dresden upon his return. The tltla of tha
opera is not announced, but the composer
has confided to a friend that it deals with
the gypsies. Paderewskl has studied them
as few In Europe have ever done, and he
knows their life as if he were one of them.
The opera will be produced under Capell
meister Schurch, and the composer ex
pects to overlook rehearsals. Perhaps thia
opera means the beginning of the end, so
far as our personal knowledge or the nsan
is concerned. He is reported as savimc
that he will soon abandon his present pr3
fession altogether and devote htmsel: to
composition. . "I am not as young as I onca
was," he said, "and I see clearly that, no
matter how assiduously I practice, my fin

In, the evening the party;, was Invited up
stairs to the German living-room. They
found the' room furnished In true German
fashion; dark wainscoting, porcelain stove
and loaded table. A group of people
dressed In Tyrolean costume greeted the
guests. 'Â¦':. â¢]Â¦''. "
It was a delightful surprise to the

comfortably, and. leaned back dreamily to
listen to the series of Tyrolean songs that
was passing about the table.
All of a sudden the guests were startled.
A little American girl .was. at the table â
a governess in the German's \ family. The
party had supposed that , she understood
not â¢ a \word of the songs, \ but when her
turn came what was their surprise to see
her .'calmly; stand and sing : In the purest
German Ia v bewitching-, topical song that
left all previous singers eclipsed.
"Brava! â fraulein, braya!". shouted ?.I.
Paderewskl, leaning across the table and
shaking hands with the modest : little
American. 'Then he deliberately forsook

heartily. And together they settled down

past I visited the animals of the park.

OVER three months ago I left the
Indian Normal School, situated at
Lawrence, Kansas, for this city, to
do for myself, and to use the first
clbfs education that I had acquired
through the generosity of good Uncle
Earn. For ten years I had been storing
my mind with useful Information, and
during this period I was a constant as
sociate with Indian boys and girls from
different parts cf the country- In Carlisle
alone there are representatives from over
elxty different tribes. I grew to love them
all and formed an early resolution to
nerve the Indian race Instead of my own
tribe only. This I have tried to accom
plish by creating a public opinion favor
able to the race, and In this I feel that
my efforts have not been In vain; but
there Is much yet to be done. There.are
prejudiced minds that yet believe It lm-
possible to civilize the Indian, and con
demn the Government for maintaining
the large number of Indian schools now
educating between 25.000 and 30.0)0 Indian
children. It was to convince this class
of their wrong that I left my. people. I
wished to show them that an education Is
of use to an Indian, and although I have
to sell papers on the street until some
thing better offers itself, I shall do my
best.
I arrived In this city November 21, 1539,
with money enough to keep me for one
day and without a friend to call upon.
Then the trouble began, and I experienced
the reception of a cold hard world. As
I walked up and down the streets with
an empty stomach, I formed my first opin
ion of civilization, and that opinion was
unfavorable. Never in the midst of my
ov.-p cwt'le dli I -Â»Â«e<i food Â«r she! tec
ways get the best of the bargain."
I have observed the business relations
between the white man and Indian, and
have concluded that the Indian is doomed
to ever receive the worst of the bargain.
In. barbarism he would trade- and the
shrewd white' man would always leave
him in the lurch: in civilization he is
doomed to the same fate. Speaking in
dividually, I never yet came out ahead
â¢in a bargain. A few days ago I was
taken violently ill. While In deep agony
I stepped into a drug store and a slender

profession does not tend to develop publio
speaking as a rule, is a persona grata
with the stenographic profession. He is
said to be one of the easiest men in the
city to take. His language is choice and
he is quite fluent. Dr. Rosenstirn Is moÂ«
rapid, but the merits of his delivery and
language, make him a comparatively eon>
f ortable man to report. Dr. McNutt show*
a defect that Is not at all uncommon to
most speakers. He tells to form his sen
tences as rapidly as his ideas com* to
him. and is compelled sometimes to lour*

brighter colors have their charm by
the way of oddity.
The only walking shape of the
group is by Mme. Herts Boyer. It
tilts forward as if it were going to
slide over the zveare/s nose in an
other minute, but it never does. It
takes several smartly jeweled hat
pins to ward off the catastrophe,
however. It woidd take another
column to tell about the hat
pins of the season. "That's an
other story."
This hat is made of straw that
matches to a dot the shade 'of the
violets that adorn it, and those vio
lets in turn match to a dot the flow
ers that greet your eyes at every
t Market-street corner. They are
huddled in plump bunches against
the rolling brim of the hat, and un
der them lies a bed of their own
green leaves, curled a wee bit at the
edges. High against the crown
stand loops of pastel blue silk that
add unto the picture of the some-*
body beneath.
-w The cherry hat by Camille Rog*
ers is as blazing as ripe July, and
it was created for none but the
Spanish-eyed maiden. From the,:
red velvet folds on the crown droop^
heavy, glistening cherries on slen
der stems, just as they droop from
a summer bough.
The Mile. Held is another whim
of Camille Rogers, and is as bold
a thought as ever milliner harbored*
Mile. Rogers has a fancy for the
fruits made this year of 1900, and
upon the Mile. Held she has tzvined
a grapevine that loads the brim and
falls forward in a mass of fruit
and leaves and tendrils in good
September style. The grapes are
purple enough for the wine press,
and they look, as small Gladys ob
served, "more real than real ones."
An irrational bow of black French
velvet gesticulates jt pan the crown,
and a little novelty in the shape of t
a strazv buckle clasps the folds be
hind. Against the hair comes a
facing of white satin covered with
black tulle.
The Virot design is a garden
party triumph. It began with a
LegJiorn braid, but the braid zvas
soon lost under the lace that the
artist used. Real Renaissance it
is, loads of it, heaps of it, and forth
from the lace blossomed the daint
iest of French roses. They are
pink roses, pastel pink themselves,
and' under the brim is crushed pas
tel pink silk, caught in its folds by
a three-barred jeweled buckle.
They are dreams, all of them.
To be sure, the tints and materials
warrant them fleeting dreams. One
hairing fleeted, the only remedy iÂ»â Â»

rOO know the colors that
the sky wears just after the
sun slips away. Pink is one
of ijiem, the faintest kind of pink.
Then there is a suggestion of blue,
no deeper than the tint of a bird's
egg, and green and yellow and lav
ender that are only hints of those
colors.
Somehow the Paris milliners
have had their eyes opened to those
sky colors this year. Probably they
have seen them from their zeesi
windows as they were shutting up
shop during all their professional
lives, but it has only this season oc
curred to than to use all their com
binations on professional palettes.
The result is an Easter flaunting
of what they call "pastel" designs.
Of these Mrs. Gage has imported
some notable selections.
There is the hat from the Mares
cot Soeurs, for instance, with a
crown of heliotrope. Tuscan straw
as a basis, the artist has piled up a
great drift of ribbon rosettes in no
less than four of these elusive pas
tel tints. And there is no danger
of their not harmonizing; the sky
painter says so.
The Esther Meyer design carries
out the pastel idea in its foliage.
The wreath of leaves is colored af
ter the fashion of little budding
leaves that hardly know whether to
be pink or green under the spring
sunshine, and make a faint attempt
at both. Mile. Meyer twines her
garland about a puffy shape of real
Renaissance lace.
- The forget-me-not garden comes
'from a pattern by Linn Faulkner.
What peep of the hat may be caught
beneath the mass of blue blossoms
is seen to be of Neapolitan blue
braid, and in among the flowers
snuggles a fat silk rosette of the
same shade. A facing of black vel
vet makes the design safe for any
complexion.
A gold c::J y:"j- z>:C. -'."af
fair comes from MLhniczvics Cv- '
vce. It looks to be merely a flurry
of white tulle and gold lace, caught
into a form of possibility by folds
of pastel yellow velvet. But there
is a method in the madness of it
that the amateur might as well give
up trying to imitate. The chances
are that she will throw azvay her
wire and pins in despair, and serve

Mine. Pouyanne builds upon a
simple shape of white straw. It
amounts to nothing more than a

guesses its modest origin when
viadame has done with it. She has
dressed it in great . rose foliage that
shines as bright as a rosebush after

She tore her hand from his hold and

But she spoke to an empty pantry.
Brown had been summoned' to the draw

men act like they did at thi3 wreck It Isn't
so bad after all.
"One of the sailors in our boat had no
more than shouted 'There Isn't any beach*
than we struck against a small cliff. My
husband jumped out in hla big rubber
boots, and in five minutes we were ashoit-,
although the breakers were still dashing
over us.
"I shall never forget how hard thos<Â»
men worked removing the baggage and
provisions. Soon pieces of the shattered
and torn bottom of the wrecked ship
drifted ashore and we built a fire, but
Captain Snow stayed by his ship for over
three hours longer and displayed excep
tional bravery. -."i -;.
"There was only about fifteen feet of
beach between the water and the cliff,
towering 400 feet high. Up this incline we
had to climb as the tide rose, and as wa
clung to the projecting sharp rocks fre
quently pieces would crumble off end
strike us.
"On the third day the men managed to
launch a boat and they rowed nine miles
to the cannery, returning with a big rtory.
Into this we packed everything, and with
high tide and new hopes we started for
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
cannery on Kadlak Island. There we had
to remain from February 2 till the 27th,
when we went aboard the Excelsior up
to Unalaska. for she had to take the mall
up. From there we returned to Unga and
then to Seattle, a Journey of eight days.
From Seattle we came home by rail.

xeemed to me as if there was considerable
prejudice existing against him. But It H
true, he got into the first boat, and after
a while I heard rim say. 'Oh. I've forgot
ten ray three prisoners.' We were tclil

OUR OREGON
SISTERSÂ¦râ^ RANKFORT, Ky.. March 24.â F.
jj Wharton Golden of Barboursvllle
j' was to-day put on the witness stand
JL (n the examination of Secretary of
State Caleb Powers, charged with
conspiracy to murder Senator Goebel. He
I did not hesitate in his replies to questions
and his testimony made a deep Impression.
According to Golden Caleb Powers was
one of the prime movers In the bringing
to Frankfort of the mountaineers Just be
fore the assassination of Goebel; although
Secretary Powers simply instructed him
to "bring witnesses who were mountain
feudists." yet Golden understood that they
Â¦were to come to Frankfort for possibly a
more sinister purposeâ that of "cleaning
out" the Democratic majority In the Leg-
Ilslature. Golden brought In the name of
Governor Taylor In an incidental way;
also the names of Culton. John Powers.
Captain Davis. Charles Flnlay. Judge
Bingham and others, the plan to bring
the mountaineers to Frankfort having
taken on a wider scope than expected. It
1b expected the Commonwealth will rest
st the conclusion of Golden's testimony.
Golden was eelzed with a slight hemor
rhage during the morning and adjourn
ment was taken earlier than usual.
Attorneys for the Commonwealth say
that Golden's testimony Is practically the
capstone of the whole structure of evi
dence and expect to "prove by It not only
that a conspiracy existed, but also who
were implicated.
The courtroom was Jammed long before
the hour set for the examination and a
large crowd remained outside. .
Golden as a Witness.
Secretary of State Powers was brought
into court this morning and Golden was
the first witness. He said he had known
Secretary Powers for about eighteen years
p.nd that he knew Mr. Culton. He was
also acquainted with Governor Taylor and
Captain John Powers. He said he was a
friend to all of the defendants. He was
in Frankfort In January and February
and saw Sfcretary Powers nearly every
day. He was In Frankfort on January. 1*
and went to Laurel County for three or
four days, from there returning to Frank
fort.
"From there where did you goâ to Bar
boursvine?" asked Attorney CampbelL
After hesitating the witness said:.
"I won't answer that.",,'
"When did you have a conversation with
Secretary Powers T' . . -Â¦ . . .
"When Mr. Powers and I left . here . to
gether. Colonel Powers told me to go to
3 1 arlan County and tell Postmaster John
Hirst to send down ter. witnesses in thÂ»
British. If he stands to fight he may be
detained for. some time. Â¦' .-'Â¦ Â¦
-'-'/Lord I Roberts has how.;been more than
ten days " at ;BloÂ»-Â»mfontein. Â¦-Â¦ He seems to
wish r to settle the country-behlnd him be
fore going on. Probably, too. he has ex
tensive X prieparations to ' complete. His
next campaign will go Into the , dry sea
son, when the nights are of ten, very . cold
and the .veldt is : dry and bare. He will
want his men equipped for this. season
and his transport service qualified: to be
as near: independent as , possible of grass
and water.' '.The design no doubt, ls that
General Buller in the next advance will
move, simultaneously with Lord Roberts.
General Buller, perhaps is not ready.
; "Lord Roberts will, shortly have the
eighth division and may also form of the
troops now. available a new tenth divi
sion. He will then hav>i In his own hands
70,000 men and General Buller will have
40.000. â¢ Â¦'^yÂ£&ssS&BBmi&&
"The former force need not necessarily
be moving . all on one line, for It would
be easy to form a third column to cross
the Vaal 'River =at KimbÂ«riÂ«r and turn
any Boer, defense on that river. In view
of these. figures and the known power of
Lcrd.Roberts, as a leader. I attach little
importance to; the Boer declarations that
they will make a big fight. If they stand
before they are driven into Pretoria I ex
pect they will be enveloped. They may
defend Pretoria, but that can help them
but little. It. will be a question of weeks.
Roberts may be looked for. north
of the Vaal at the end of April and be
fore Pretoria/ if the Boers fall back, to
that place, in the first half of May."

This statement was made to-day by Wharton Golden, a frail, consumptive-looking Kentucky mountaineer, while on
the witness-stand In the preliminary examination of Secretary of State Caleb Powers, charged with ' conspiracy to kill
Goebel. Golden told a story of the events leading up. to the murder that. -If substantiated, 'will,' "ln '"the: minds of. those
connected with the prosecution, at least.' probably go far toward proving the contentions of the commonwealth that" the
murder was the result of a plan- In which .several prominent men were involved, j Whether. the_ defense , will seek, to, Im
peach Golden" s testimony in this preliminary examination is not known, as the attorneys for the def ense. will, not ]talk
on the subject: but unless 'such attempt Is made the commonwealth will rest Its case, both County Attorney Polsgrove
and Attorney Campbell being satisfied that enough evidence has been presented to. hold, the defendants on. the charges.
Golden, who claims to have been a friend to Secretary Powers and his brother, John Powers, for years.. gave testimony
that was particularly damaging to John Powers, but. he also brought .in. the, names, of many others, including Charles
FinJey. W. H. Sutton and Governor Taylor, in his story of the bringing of the mountaineers' to Frankfort previous to
the assassination. Governor Taylor, however.-was not directly Implicated, and ; the attorneys for the commonwealth In- :Â¦

The testimony did not show that the alleged plot to kill Goebel was part of the original plan," nor did it'contaln the
names of those who conceived that idea. But the: commonwealth sought to show by Golden's conversations with va
rious people that not only John and Caleb Powers, but others as well, had full knowledge of the alleged plan of as
sassination. - â¢ ...
among the people the impression pro
duced is a most painful one. â¢ >
It Is not exaggeration to say that they
feel they are treated. as a conquest, by a
nation stranger to their race. The dif
ference in - language, though' it accounts
for much; does not account for this feel-
Ing, nor have there been arbitrary mili
tary acts to create resentment. The
military authority in operation is a fic
tion. No one Â¦ feels its weight er com
plains of oppressive actions. . The army
officers are well liked by the people. The
return of many of them to the United
States has brought out evidences of good
will. 1
Not to. know of this and the American
feeling, would be to be without eyes, or
ears. I have of ten. wondered during these
last â¢ few days if .the American officials
are themselves aware of its intensity.
TIME TO DO SOMETHING
FOR THE ISLANDS
' BOSTON, March 24.â "Free trade with
Porto Rico" was the subject for discus
sion at the dinner of the New England
Free Trade ' League, held at the Hotel
Vendome to-night, and i the policy- of
President McKinley In dealing with the
Porto Rico and ' Philippine questions was
severely attacked. Among the. speakers
were Congressman De Armond of Mis
souri, President "David Starr Jordan of
Leland Stanford University and Patrick
A. Collins. ! Congressman De Â¦ Armond
said: Â¦- . - . . -Â¦ . - f " :S'.'yt Â¦ '
"It has seemed to me that the general
sentiment on tariff laws constructed sole
ly; for. revenue Is unfavorable. What we
need -more.' than "anything else Is liberal
trade ' principles." I' don't believe In pro
tection as a doctrine or, policy, j I .don't
believe the present prosperity of thÂ«
country is due to protection. Ton need
free and unrestricted markets. People
unobstructed and left free will buy and
sell where they can do so to the best ad
vantage. It Is not a matter of sentiment,
but commercial Interests. Just so far as
people depend on legislation alone to do
things for them. Just so far will they fall
short of what they wish to do. Tou are
in - the height and glory of your ability
In manufacturing. In the broad field of
manufacturing with a given amount of
money and a given amount of time, you
can compete with the - world. If that be
true the only question Is how you can
pain a broader field; how obstacles can
be removed. All history goes to show that
trade Is a pursuit of peace and that the
great triumphs are gained by the best
equipped.
"Theoretically and practically. I think
free trade Is absolutely correct. At least
it seems to me a- tariff law such as will
bring revenue, and only revenue, is what
you ought to labor for. The Porto Rlcan
question would be a farce If It were not
a tragedy."
President Jordan said Porto Rico and
the Philippines were not the only coun
tries oppressed by us, but that we had
mistreated Cuba, the American Indians
and others In the same way. He spoke of
aristocracy, militarism, slavery and im
perialism as the four great evils of hu
manity, speaking humorously of the "ad
vantages of Imperialism."
Â¦ Patrick A. Collins said we could not af
ford'to break our pledge to Porto Rico
any longer. He said he would like to see
Cuba' and Porto Rico set up for them
selves.' and he believed no European power
would Interfere with either of them as
long : as . our Government attended to its
.business and relied on the Monroe doc

NEW YORK. March 24.â The Herald
correspondent sends the' following
under date of San Juan, March 17:
The American military officials
'told me that the year and a. half
of American, sovereignty had j been a
blight on the Island. This was not the
echo of the Spanish or of Porto Rlcans*
feelings. They spoke their own views
with soldierly frankness and sometimes
with a word of regret for their own po
sition. '
Leaving for the moment the question
of responsibility," no one can doubt the
evidence of the senses/ The blight is
here. It spreads over the town and' out
into the country. Trade is dead and mer
-cantlle and industrial activity Is para
lyzed/ In the isolated mountain districts
where the entire dependence of the popu
lation is on coffee growing there !s still
': much misery and without- aid from some
quarter, the people would starve.
I have asked a number of army officers
who have been . stationed' in. the isolated
I sections and they tell me as much, but
they add that the tendency to pauperiz
ing the inhabitants is becoming pro
nounced, and that in the sugar and; to
bacco regions the relief i should be
stopped. In those districts there is some
work and money could ; be earned with
which Â¦ to buy supplies and a ' little local
trade be set in motion again.".

LONDON". March 23.â Lord Roberts Is
still marking time at Bloemfontein.
"At . least he has .not yet begun
pushing his ' army .northward to

from being wasted ,by' the. British com
mander In chief, as an advanced would be
a risky matter unless the country, behind
him was fairly' settled . and cleared of
armed bodies of Boers before he set out.
This preliminary work is now. being ac
complished. Lord : Roberts ' telegraphs
that the country to the south of.Bloem
fonteln is gradually quieting 'down; that
large quantities of arms , have "been de
livered up to the British authorities, and
that the Free Staters are 'beginning to
recopnize the advantage of ' bringing. In
supplies for sale to the troops. _ * *
â¢Military operations in the western dis
tricts. Lord Roberts adds, are being at
tended with good results. That, of course.
Is another thing for' which- Lord "Roberts
Is waiting. He will doubtless delay also
until General j French -, has-- disposed of
Commandant Ollvler's .. retreating com
mando and is able to . report the country
free from armed Boers. :Â¦â¢Â¦.-'.: Â¦â¢Â¦.-'. : ,-.Â¦Â¦-.

*â¢ ... Special DUp*tch to The Can.
VANCOUVER. B. C. March U.â When
Harry Edwards,- manager of the Oriental,
one _of - the largest hotels In Vancouver,
left three weeks ago for the States, most
people believed his statement that he was
off on, a well-earned holiday. Now. how
ever, Edwards is in San Francisco, and for
the reasons found in the hotel safe, that
was blown open this morning by the pro
prietor. It is not expected that he will ever
again turn up In Vancouver.
Edwards, as manager of the Oriental for
a year, did a large business, and the fact
that- Proprietor Stevens did not receive
large profits was due. as explained by Ed
wards, to the extravagant legacies left by
predecessors in office. Edwards' defalca
ilÂ°Â£. s "amounted to over JoOOO. There is
$3000 missing -according to the books and
how much more was put down by the
dishonest manager is not known. A party
of three Klondlkers left about $20<jO in
gold dust and nuggets in the care of the
manager, and the most of this Is gone. It
Is said that other guests of the house lost
smaller amounts.
Edwards' wife was left here as a screen.
She averred that her husband had desert
ed her, land so took temporary employ
ment In a steam laundry. She left yes
terday,-morning to join Â¦ her - husband in
San Francisco. Edwards Is an English
man of .' checkered career, ' having been
through . several gold excitements In Aus
tralia and ' New Zealand.
Africa she is to go out to him and marry
him there. It is London's parallel for the
Stephanieâ Lonyay romance, with the

KAISER'S NAVAL
BILL IS AGAIN
TO THE FORE
Official Press Panning the
. Agitation for More
Ships.
Argues That the Increase of Popula
tion Will Bender Special Taxa
tion for the Project Un
necessary*
Copyrighted. 1900. by the Associated Press.
1 BERLIN, March 24.â During the coming
"week the naval bill comes up before the
special Reichstag committee. The argu
ments pro and con were pretty thoroughly
exhausted in the plenary debates, but the
question of how the expenses are
to be met will occasion lively dis
cussions. The Government adheres
to . the belief that no special taxa
tion is necessary, but that the natural
Increase of the population, now nearly a
million a year, brings sufficient Increase
in the amount of. taxes to meet the re
quired expenditures, always provided that
the present state of commercial prosper
ity throughout the empire continues.
Against this calculation the Centrists, es
pecially, maintain that it is too uncertain
and must reckon with years of depression.
This party proposes new taxes, placing
the weight of the fleet expenses on com
mercial circles, particularly on Bourse
operators and exporters. Naturally the
Liberal parties object to this.
Since other important questions like the
meat and Heinze bills have focused pub
lic attention for weeks past, the Govern
ment is now re-engaged, through the
semi-official press, in fanning the agita
tion in favor of the fleet Increase, the
official Berliner Correspondenzt to-day
presenting a most potent argument on the
subject, in conclusion expressing the be
lief that Germany, even after the enor
mous naval increase, will not have to
fight a naval war, "as an acknowledged
strong one Is not attacked, but to vouch
safe Germany's further maritime growth
a powerful navy is absolutely required."
One Million Toilers Idle.
A commercial survey for Germany dur
ing the present month appears In to-day's
Tageblatt, apparently based on reliable
figures. Its gist Is as follows:
Germany, for the first time In history. Is un
able to employ about 1,000,000 toilers â not be
causa of lack of work, but because of lack of
fuel and raw stuffs. The Austrian ooal strike
is partly responsible for this, and all the Indus
tries here are overcrowded with orders, the Iron
Industry being the most affected, the Prussian
Government alone having: recently placed orders
for 600 locomotives and $600 cars. The whole
machine Industry Is In a similar condition ex
cectins the bicycle business.
Within a year thirty-six bicycle works have
ceased ts exiet. The German shipyards ara
overcrowded with war vessels in course of con
struction. In thirty-nine yards there ara now
in progress O f construction Â£2S vessels of every
kind. The German foreign trade of IS9S amount
ed to ten milliards, of which seven were marl
time, meaning an Increase In the latter of 1.300,
000,000 marks. The came ratio of Increase Is
maintained. German capital invested in ship
ping amounts to nearly 600,000,000 marks, and Is
yearly increasing. Even the textile Industry is
flourishing, and tha employes' wages ara being
r&Ued without strikes.
The Tageblatt concludes:
AH this would be 'jeopardized If Germany leg
islated antl-ccmmercially.
The meat bill has been shelved until
after Eastertide.
Prince Hohenlohe's toast at the lunch
eon given to the bi-centennial delegates.
In which he deprecated the growing ma
terialism, which, he 6aid. reminded him
"of certain processes of animal life," and
expressed the hope that science would
continue to counteract gross materialism,
is commented on vigorously by the Ger
man press. The National Zeitung to-day
6ays the toast will renew the agrarian
attacks on the Imperial Chancellor, but
unfortunately the Government, whose
head he is, makes concession after con
cession to this same materialism.
The Vorwaerts draws an interesting
parallel between Prince Hohenlohe's and
Emperor William's bi-centenary toasts,
the Chancellor calling upon scientists to
avoid the warfare against threatened
reactionaries, and his Majesty asking
science to keep aloof from politics.
Beconciliation of the Guelphs.
Court circles regrard the engagement of
Prince Max of Baden to Princess Marie
Louise of Cumberland as indicative of a
complete reconciliation of the Guelphs. ,-

FACE A CRISIS
Socialists and Radicals De
termined to Reform the
Constitution.
Belief That Zither the Italian Cabinet
Must Resign or the Chamber
of Deputies Be Dis
solved.
ROME, March 24.â 1n the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the resumption of the de
bate on the motion of Slgnor Pantano.
Radical, first Introduced yesterday, pro
viding for the convocation of the Constit
uent Assembly for the reform of the con
stitution, was marked by scenes of dis-.
order. The President, who yesterday re
fused to put the motion and was sustained
by the House, to-day prevented Slgnor
Pantano making a speech, whereupon the
Socialists abusod the President. His ac
tion, however, was approved by a major
ity of the Chamber.
This gave rise to a tremendous tumult,
the Socialists and Radicals shouting and
cheering for the ConstltuentAssembiy and
the Conservatives and Moderates respond
ing with cheers for the King and mon
archy. Eventually the President was com
pelled to suspend the session. On its re
sumption the President designated a Con
servative as the next speaker. At this the
Leftists violently protested, demanding
that Slgnor Pantano be allowed to be
heard.
A deafening uproar resulted. The Cham
ber resembled a bear garden, each side
trying to howl the other down. Finally
the President pronounced the adjourn
ment of the house.
It Is the general Impression that, in face
of the opposition's determined policy of
obstruction, tha eolution of the crisis Is
the resignation of the Ministry or the
dissolution of the Chamber.

FUTILE ATTACK

Storm.
Interpellations IMrected at M. Mil

Grief in the Chamber of
Deputies.
Copyrighted, 1300, by tti* Ajwooiated Press.
PARIS, March 24.â The Waldeck-Rous
seau Ministry, after enjoying a short
breathing spell, had to sustain another
assault from its Nationalist opponents in
the Chamber of Deputies this week and
came through the ordeal without much
difficulty. Indeed the only result the
Nationalists achieved is to accentuate
the fact that the Government has come
to stay through the exposition. Their
organs beat the air with violent and
ceaseless strictures upon the Govern,
ment's policy and with attempts to.em
broil France In foreign complications, but
Parliament seems determined to leave
the reins of power in M. Waldeck-Rous
seau's hands.
The opposition, having failed In frontal
attacks, tried a flanking movement on
Friday and again came to grief. It
brought forward two interpellations
which were pistols leveled at the head of
M. Millerand, the Minister of Commerce
and Industry, and both missed fire. M.
Millerand is the Nationalist bete noire and
is also the most vulnerable point In the
Government's armor on account of his
socialistic opinions. In Friday's interpel
lations the opposition sought to show that
his action on the questions under discus
sion was prompted "by his personal In
terests and was to the prejudice of the
interests of the country. The success of
the interpellations would have involved
the resignation of M. Millerand â¢â¢ and a
Cabinet crisis, which the opposition hoped
would lead to the breaking up of the
Ministryâ to divide the order of the day
and to overthrow the Government, as M.
Millerand himself described their tactics
in defending his action. " '
Two Interpellations FaiL
â¢ Th Â£., flrst interpellation, which accused
M. Millerand of promising a subvention

withdrawn on M. Delcasse, the Foreign
Minister, replying that the Cabinet had
unanimously decided not to grant the
subvention. ThiÃ declaration showed that
no dissension exited within the Ministry

The eecond interpellationâ regarding the

Considerable interest, not unmixed with

plaster cast of the brain before the Acad

convolutions are remarkably well â¢ de
veloped, the brain closely resembling that
of Gambetta, from ; which he concludes
that Vacher was a neglected genius and
might have been a great leader of democ
racy; while, following the same theory, he
thinks Gambetta, in Vacher's surround

THREE TOPICS
GREAT BRITAIN
IS DISCUSSING
Parliament's Dissolution,
Federation and .Treat
ment of Prisoners.
Salisbury Awaiting thÂ« Triumph of
British Arms Before Appealing
to the Electors of tha
Kingdom.
Copyrighted. 1900, by thÂ» Associated Press.
LONDON, March 24.â Three questions
involving .endless controversy and specu
lation have been rife during the week.
They are the possibility of the dissolu
tion of Parliament In 'the summer, Im
perial federation and the method of treat
ment of the so-called rebel prisoners In
South Africa. So far as Parliament la
concerned it might as well dissolve at
once for all the interest that Is being
taken in its proceedings. Many appar
ently inspired articles appear forecasting
dissolution at various dates, but as a
matter of fact the existence of the pres
ent house depends entirely upon the pro
gress of. British arms in South Africa. If
they meet with quick success there will
be, it is thought, an early dissolution. If
the war drags on Lord Salisbury will re
tain power till the last moment allowed
by the British constitution. With less
than a year in which to go to the coun
try it is only natural that the Govern
ment will seize the most opportune mo
ment, but no member of the Cabinet be
lieves that such a moment has yet come
within the limits of reasonable determin
ation in spite of the fact that the com
mander in chief of the forces. Lord
Woleeley, Is credited with prophesying
that Lord Roberts will be In Pretoria by
May 16. If the forecast of the almost for
gotten chief commander of the British
army would prove correct lt^would not
be at all unlikely that Lord Salisbury
may appeal to the electors In June.
Selieve Peace Is Far Away.

Â«<- sÂ£? I^ord Lansdowne, the Secretary
?L Â£1Â° 1 have emedi h Â°PÂ« that
}ht w " c over before the fall of
this year. With such a diversity of opin
ion prevailing in the best informed circles
regarding the duration of the conflict, it
is evidently futile to prophesy reirardini?
Â«Â«Â» tenure of the present &vlrasS?t!
fv, *}. *r Â°^ v L 0U ? ly dependent upon
the former. Lord Salisbury has no inten
tion of appealing to the voters unUl the
British arms triumph in South Africa and
no one of any importance has yet been
brave enough tl declare over his own
name when emch an event 1b likely to be
accomplished. Hence the guesses at the
date of the dissolution of Parliament are
scarcely worth repeating. When the gen
eral election comes it can scarcely fall to
return the present administration to
power, unless between this time and that
period some miracle effects the cohesion
of the disintegrated Liberal party. So
disintegrated does thU party appear to be
that Sir. Edward Gray, the shining light
of the Rosebery faction, found it-neces
sary this week when speaking at the City
Liberal Club, London, to protest that in
ternal dissension was no just cause for
the death of the basic Liberal principles.
It Is a curious travesty upon truth that
imperial federation and the formation of
some great council of the empire have
been brought more to public notice by
Sir Wilfrid Laurler, the Canadian Pre
mier. In his speech at Ottawa, than even
by the presence In London of the federa
tion delegates from Australia,
Punch's chief cartoon this week Is de
voted to depicting Sir Wilfrid Laurier in
pleasing contrast with Sir Wilfrid Law
son, the English Liberal, who Insists that
the war is not Justified. Yet those who
know the undercurrent* thoroughly are
well aware that the Canadian Premier's
attitude and unwillingness to send out
Canadian troops caused the Colonial Of
fice more anxiety than almost any. recent
occurrence.
Federation Movement Spreading.
, However, the imperial federation move
ment grows daily. The Imperial federa
tion committee has secured from Lord
Salisbury a promise to seriously consider
its proposals for an imperial council to
watch over the interests of the empire as
a whole. On all sides articles appear de
bating the ways and means by which the
colonies which have participated In 1 the
defense of the empire may have a voice
in its councils. What difficulties stand In
the way of this are apparent from Â¦ the
proceedings of the Australian delegates
daily visiting the Colonial Office In the
interest of their federation bill. All sorts
of unexpected hitches have come up and
it is feared the federation may have to be
submitted ad referendum to the Austra
lian people In consequence of the changes
which,. after closer inspection by the im
perial authorities,- appear necessary, . al
though the bill has already been passed by
Australia and the referendum would de
lay action for almost a year.
: It is reported that the Duke of York
meditates paying complimentary visits
after the war to all the great colonies.
â¢ The great question of the colonial pris
oners from being ; the subject of cable
messages exchanged between Lord Salis
bury and President Kruger, has Â¦ sprung
Into general discussion. In this connection
it is understood that President Kruger set
the ball rolling by demanding that colo
nial insurgents and British subjects com
mandeered by the Boers should, when
captured,, be treated as prisoners of, war
or Â¦ else . reprisals ... -would be taken on the
British prisoners at Pretoria." Lord Salis
bury replied, saying he would deal with
the rebels as seemed fit. and would hold
President Kruger personally responsible
for the treatment of the Pretoria prison
ers, whereupon President Kruger Is re
ported to have ; rejoined that lie : would
hold Lord Salisbury personally, responsible
for the rebels, or something of that na
ture.
Leniency Is, Favored.
But on all sides is being discussed what
enould be done: with the Insurgents cap
tured by the British. A commission of
British judges to go out . to the Cape Is
talked of, though this Is scarcely likely to
occur. The predominating feeling seems
to favor the policy of leniency now being
carried out under Lord Roberts' direction,
in spite of 'the fact that both through ca
ble dispatches from South Africa and let
ters , from , English readers â¢In the news
papers ; there has been a bitter outcry
against allowing the Insurgents to go scot
free. But the sober-minded >. newspapers
are convinced of : the â¢ fact ; that Â» the main

In old age the mucous membranes be-
come ' thickened and partly lose their
function. This leads to partial loss of
hearing, smell and taste, as well as di-
gestive disturbances. Pe-ru-na corrects
all this by its specific operation on all the
mucous membranes of the body. One

it didn't do any good. I had no strength

region of the Cordilleras, where, 14,250 feet
above the sea, is a group of large lakes of
very cold, pure water, without Inlet or
outlet. They receive the drainage of the
surrounding hills and conceal it some
where, but there is no visible means of its
escape. A fringe of Ice forms around the
edges of the lake every night the year
round; yet they contain an excellent va
riety of fish, called the pejerray. which is
caught near .the shore and sold at. Puna
and in other neighboring towns. The two
largest , lakes, Saracocha and ; Cachipas
cana, with several smaller ones in the
same neighborhood, are owned by the
family of Mr. Romana of Arequipa, who
has Just beeen elected President of Peru.
He owns immense tracts of land in this
locality, with thousands of sheep, cattle,
llamas, alpacas and vicunas, which are
herded upon it. .-â¢'.:
A curious phenomenon about the lakes
Is that they keep at the same level all the
time, regardless of the dry and rainy sea
sons. Â¦ No amount of rain will make any
difference with their depth, which, how
ever, in the center is unknown. And this
adds to the awe and mystery with which
they are regarded by the Indians.
â¢ There are no boats upon the lakes, ex
cept a few small balas, or rafts, made of
bundles of straw,. which Keep very close
to the shore, for fear of being drawn into
whirlpools that are â¢ said to exist in the
center. There Is some foundation for this
fear, for only two or three years ago a
balsa containing five men disappeared , in
the darkness and was never heard of
again. Of course it may have tipped over
and its occupants have been paralyzed by
the cold water in an ordinary way; but
their bodies never were discovered nor did
the balsa ever float to shore. Therefor*
the people think the whole party ' â¢ was
lured into a maelstrom and swallowed up
by the mysterious waters. Â¦ uafMUÃw ii
ThÂ« whirlpool near the center of Lake
Popo which receives the waters of Lake
TltJcaca is well known, and hundreds of
men have lost their lives by venturing
too near it. Boats that ' are â¢ drawn " into
the current are whirled swiftly around a

ALL EUROPE IN LINE
FOR THE "OPEN DOOR"
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 24.â Beyond as
certaining from foreign governments
whether they would have any objection
to the publication of the texts of their
notes relative to the protection of Ameri
can treaty rights In" spheres of influence
possessed by them In China, the State
Department has completed the "open
door" negotiations and stands i^ady to
answer Cummings' resolution, which was
adopted by the House of Representatives
to-day. The department is entirely satis
fled with the result of the negotiations,
and it is expected that the President will
take advantage of the transmission of the
documents to ' Congress to point out 'the
great â¢ value which will accrue to - the
United States by the establishment of the
"open door" for .American goods.
The assurances received are regarded by
the administration as very liberal indeed.
Great Britain gives the United States the
fullest guarantee; Germany points to
Klaochau, which is an open port," as to
what she has done and proposes to do;
Russia refers to Talienwan, also 'open,
as to her policy, and France asserts that
sho does' not recognize spheres , of Influ
ence. Japan is naturally in favor of the
establishment and -maintenance of the
"open door," and Italy has necessarily
followed the lead of the other European
powers. So far as China is . concerned,
the authorities say its views In the matter
are of no importance, as the negotiations
have Â¦ not been conducted with her, but
with other powers.

"I understood the remark that we had

The witness then took up the events
after the shooting. He said he saw a man

and John Powers had a conversation.
Counsel for the defense strongly objected
to this line of examination and the com

that it was through with the witness.
Golden, who was very weak from his
hemorrhage, requested a few minutes*
rest, and he was accordingly taken out by
a Deputy Sheriff.

Uncle Sam Will Not Interfere.
WASHINGTON, March 24.â 1t was stat
ed authoritatively to-day that the visit
to Washington of Kentucky Republicans
has not caused the administration to
change the policy it has settled .upon re
garding the whole Kentucky controversy.
The members of the committee had pre
sented to the War Department the fact
that the Beckham faction had armed its
so-called militia forces with rifles and
equipments belonging to the United States
Government. It Is not stated that the
War Department requested the delivery
of these arms carried by the Beckham men.
but that fact was laid before the adminis
tration to be considered in connection
with the whole case. No action was tak
en, however, looking to Interfere by the
national Government in the controversy,
even on the basis of a demand for the re
turn of the United States arms, and it
is stated no action will be taken.

About two hundred and fifty nobles of
the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of
the Mystic Shrine, members of Islam
Temple of this city, left yesterday by
various trains on their pilgrimage to the
"holy city" of Sacramento, as their
mecca is designated in the official an
nouncements. A special train of four
cars, three day coaches and the Pullman.
Castille, left the Oakland mole at 4
o'clock In the afternoon and it is doubt
ful if a Jollier lot ever assembled on one
train. The Pullman was chartered
specially â¢ by Nobles Charles Goodall, J.
H. Bennett, O. J. Humphrey, William
Kldston, George Howe, John Tonningsen,
Arthur Piper, Thomas H. Browne, J. G.
Leibold, John Barneson, E. P. Hulme and
M. Martin, who for the occasion had or
ganized themselves into the "Wlsh-It-
Was-Otherwise Club." Why this name
was adopted is made apparent on the
limited number of invitations printed in
blue and gold and issued to the ladles.
This sets forth in bold letters: "Ladies
not allowed to visit Sacramento, but you
are invited to attend a ladles' reception
given by the 'Wish-It-Was-Otherwise
Club' at the Oakand mole - Saturday,
March 24, 1900. leaving San Francisco at
3:30 p. m. and accompanying the A. A. O.

not invited. Flowers accepted." J&hn
Tonningsen, the Beau Brummel of the
party, explained that the cUib wished it
was otherwise, that is that the ladles
could accompany them to Sacramento,
but it could not be.
.The following named ladies accepted the
invitation: Mrs. John Tonningsen. Miss

they brought great bunches of flowers,
with which they decorated the Interior
of the car. While awaiting the departure
of the train the- nobles, through, their
dusky servitors; brought from the wilds
of Araby. 1 served the ladies with a deli
cate collation, cakes, candies and light
refreshments, such as Shrlners only use
at the festal board. The ladies in return
for the courtesies extended delighted the
nobles up to the point of debarkation with
music and songs. tAt Sixteenth street
there was sorrow at parting, but all the
ladles wished the Shriners a pleasant

EARLY VOTE ON
THE PORTO RICAN
TARIFF BILL
Foraker Says It Must Be
Taken in the Senate *
by Thursday.
President Authorized to Appoint a
Commission to Investigate
Trade in the
' Orient
"WASHINGTON. March 24.â For a few.
minutes to-day surprise, bordering almost
on consternation in some quarters, was
created by a request by Foraker that the
Porto Rican government bill be . recom
mitted to the Porto Rican committee. The
request precipitated' a lively colloquy, but
It finally, was developed that the bill For
aker wanted recommitted was the govern
ment measure now on the calendar, and
not the unfinished business. During the
elucidation of his request, however, For
aker plainly, indicated that it was his pur
pose to separate the bills and press the
Porto Rican tariff bill to an early vote,
his desire being to have the vote taken
not later than next Thursday.
Foraker explained that he desired to
have the bill recommitted so that the com
mittee could place upon It certain amend
ments already agreed to by the Senate in
another bill. â¢ Alter some discussion the
request of Foraker that the bill be recom
mitted was agreed to by the Senate.
To Extend American Commerce
A measure was passed providing for the
appointment by the President of a com
mission to investigate the trade and com
merce of the Orient with a view to the
extension of American commerce. â¢ This
bill aroused some debate. Berry of Ar
kansas registered his protest against the
measure, his opinion being that too many
commissions were being created. "Cock
rell of Missouri opposed the measure and
stated the position of the Senate minority
on legislation. . â¢ â¢
"The Republican party is .in absolute
control," he said, "and we on this side of
the chamber are powerless to prevent the
enactment of any legislation coming from
the Republican party and deemed neces
sary by it. I will not antagonize this bill,
although I do not agree with It In princi
ple.- I want it understood novv, and un
derstood distinctly, that hereafter absolute
responsibility must rest upon the Repub
licans for the passage of all resolutions
and bills."
Gallinger of New Hampshire supported
the bill, saying the President had strongly
'recommended Its passage. Germany had
already sent commissions to the' Orient to
investigate trade and commerce. He said
it was now proposed to send this com
mission to China, Japan and other Ori
ental countries with a view to ascertain
ing whether increased markets could not
be found there for the products of Ameri
can farms, mills and workshops. '*
Hoar of Massachusetts opposed the
appointment of Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress on commis
sions or on other similar bodies,
and after some discussion the bill was so
amended that no member of either branch
of Congress shall hereafter serve under
any appointment by the executive depart
ment of the Government while holding
office as such member. Bacon of Georgia
supported the measure. . . ,
Alaskan Code Bill Called "Op.
An effort was made by Carter to secure
unanimous consent for the consideration
of the Alaskan code bill. Â» He made a
strong: appeal for the relief of the people
of Alaska. He said he made his state
ment, in order to shift the responsibility
for the measure from his shouledrs to the
Senate. Cockrell objected to the'arrange
ment proposed by Carter, but promised
to assist In the passage of the measure
when It was before the Senate In a proper
way. After a sharp colloquy between
Carter and Cockrelf the former gave
notice that he would call up the matter
again on Monday.
The closing hours of the session were
devoted to the consideration of a resolu-.
tlon accepting from the State of Indlanst
a statue of Oliver P. Morton. Fitting and
eloquent tributes were paid to the mem
ory of Mr. Morton by Fairbanks of In
diana. Allison of lowa and Beverldge of

Weapon Penetrated an Artery and

Doctor. .
?
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS. March 24.â From facts ob
tained and assertions made Joseph Lial,
a popular caterer of this 'city, evidently
met with foul play some time last night
and is at the present time in a precarious
condition. [ Lial was stabbed in the leg
with a hatpin by a woman who was mad
ly jealous of his attentions to another,
and although the weapon was not large
and only made a very small wound, yet it
penetrated a vital spot and the man
nearly bled to death. In fact, had It not
been that by chance a physician passed
the spot where Lial lay bleeding this
morning there would have been a job for
the Coroner.
From the facts best obtained it seems
that Lial had been keeping company with
a certain woman of the "tenderloin" as
well as with others. She being of a jeal
ous disposition, seriously objected to his
going with any other woman and asserted
that fact to him. On Friday night a meet-
Ing took place between the two and it is
asserted a quarrel ensued. The man be
came angry and vindictive. A struggle en
sued. The woman, being unarmed, took a
steel hatpin from her headgear and drove
it deep into the leg of her 'assailant. The
pin punctured an artery and in a very
short time he had lost a great quan
tity of blood. Realizing his condition he
ran uptown ln search of medical attention.
Before a doctor could be found, however,
he swooned 'and was bleeding to death.
Lial regained consciousness to-day, but
refused to say anything of the affair for
some time. He finally gave out the story
that a vein in his leg had broken and
that he had not had any quarrel at all.
This story, however, is not borne out by
facts obtained and the whole affair is yet
a mystery, but is being thoroughly in
vestigated.

CHICAGO, March 24.â The Record says:
Two men, who are supposed to have
been assaulted by i strikers yesterday,
were taken to the County Hospital in a
serious condition. One of them dledlater.
The dead man is Gustave Smith, 38
years of age. August Hasterock, 35 years
of age, the injured man, is suffering from
concussion of the brain.
Mystery surrounds the manner in which
Smith received his injuries. He Was
picked up at Madison and Jefferson
streets in the afternoon ln an Insensible
condition by the police. He was found
lying in the street car tracks. No one
had seen him fall, and it was thought
that probably he had been struck by a
cable train. This theory, was abandoned
after a canvass of the neighborhood and
inquiry of the railway emplpyes." !
Smith's skull was badly fractured. His
nose was broken and his 'lips cut and
bleeding. The hospital physician said; the
Injury to the head had not been caused
by a fall. In his opinion It had been in
flicted by a heavy blow from a club
Police Inspector Shea detailed several
detectives on the case, but up to late last
night little could be learned concerning
the dead man. .-..,. , VT
. Hasterock'Sj manner of .receiving" his
injury is also shrouded In mystery. ! He
was picked up at Noble and Cornell
streets in an unconscious condition by the
police. At the County Hospital it was
said that the. man was suffering from
concussion of the brain. Hasterock is un
conscious, and his condition Is said to be
serious, j He is an ironworker. â¢

accessibility that the disturbance thus far
has involved missionary interests rather
than those of trade or railway or mining
development. The movement is not so
much anti-Christian as anti-foreign.
Desolation and ruin followed everywhere
In the track of the marauders, who soon
spread over some scores of counties. The
compounds of the foreigners were speed
ily tilled with refugees, whose worldly
goods had been seized or destroyed and
â¢whose very houses had been torn down for
the timber . that they contained. . The
Roman Catholics have suffered far more
severely than the Protestants, the native
constituency of the German and Italian
missions having been harried ruthlessly,
with every attendant circumstance or Dru
tality and torture. Repeatedly, both Amer
ican and English communities have been
for days In a state of practical siege and
days have more than once been set by
public proclamation for their murder.
In October last a great body of tne
Boxers started across the country to sack
the American mission station of Pang
Chuangâ of which the well-known author,
A. H. Smith, is one of the members.
They were met in the nick of time by a
force of Chinese troops sent to the rescue
from the provincial capital. A sharp en
gagement followed and the rioters fled,
leaving a hundred of more of their num
ber dead upon the field. It was a salu
tary check and for a few days spread
dismay among the Boxers.
Government's Attitude Shown.
At this juncture the attitude of the
authorities was displayed. The Gover
nor of the provinceâ the Manchu, Yu
Hsienâ instead of promoting the officers
who had succeeded thus successfully in
carrying out their orders degraded, im
prisoned or punished every man on wnom
he could lay his hands who had been
connected with the affair. The result
was as could be foreseen. The rebellion
instantly was fanned into fresh flames
and spread more rapidly tnan before, un
der the visible assurance that orders for
its suppression were to be taken in a
Pickwickian sense only. The Governor,
according to Chinese reports, sent out in
structions i-at "all petitions and appeals
by missionaries and their converts were
to be considered as so much waste paper.
A body of the gentry called upon him to
protest against the license to pillage and
murder that he had given to the bandit
organizations of the province as likely to
set tire to the whole country if not
checked in time. Tuey were miserably
snubbed for their pains and an audience
v/as refused them. - ._Â¦
Such a policy soon produced further
fruit. In December Mr. Brooks, an Eng
lish gentleman of education and culture,
was returning from a visit to his sister
in Chinafu, when he ran across a band
of these wretches in a village. In the
bitter winter weather, with fifteen de
grees of frost, they stripped him naked,
save for a few poor rags, his nose was
slit, and with a rope through his nostrils
he was led about for several hours like
a. beast, exposed to the insults of the
people. Attempting to escape he was
killed on the spot and his head cut off
and carried away upon a pike.
The man who was directly responsible
for this atrocious deed was the high offi
cial Yu Hsien, the Manchu Governor of
the province, who a little before had been
relieved of his post and summoned to Pe
king. His degradation and punishment
are presumably demanded by the Britlsn
Government. But so far from conceding
this it is he who, according to this week s
telegram, has just been rewarded by ap
pointment as Governor of Shansi. That
there may be no doubt of the Govern
ment's attitude in the matter the former
Governor of Shantung, LI Ping Heng,
whose hatred of foreigners brought on the
troubles that culminated In the murder
of three German missionaries and the
seizure of Kiaochau, and who was "per
manently degraded from bearing office,'
on demand of the German Government,
has been appointed to one of the most
Influential posts in China, and has just
now been elevated to the first rank. Hsu
Tung the most fanatical and malignant
foe of all foreign interests, alike of trade,
commerce and Christianity, was not only
appointed guardian of the newly chosen
successor to the Emperor, but has been,
glorified by the singular honor of the
three-eyed peacock feather. The father
of the imperial successor, by the way, is
reputed to be one of the heads of the
Boxers themselves.
False Promises Made.
Meanwhile our nationals in Shantung
have been appealing steadily by letter and
telegram to our Minister at Peking, Mr.
Conger, for months past, as successive
waves of barbarism have been breaking
around them or fresh attacks planned
upon their premises. He has received
these appeals sympathetically and has un
questionably done his utmost to secure the
needed protection. Again and again he
has secured promises of immediate action
from the Tsungll Yamen. He telegraphs
back. "Soldiers will ba sent at once."
No soldiers are sent. Or, "Immediate, ar
rest of ringleaders promised." No ring
leaders are arrested. He is being thwart
ed and openly mocked in each fresh nego
tiation. Excellent instructions are no
doubt sent out, but it was long ago evi
dent that their effect is being neutralized
by secret Instructions of an opposite tenor
or by the tacitly understood desire of the
Government that nothing effective be
done. Even the newly appointed Gover
nor, General Yuan Shlh Kai, with his for
eign armed troops in numbers sufficient.
If he so desired, to suppress the disorders
within a week, had up to the latest re
ports done nothing that had offered any
serious check to the rebels. S A few friend
less and insignificant peasants are seized
and beheaded here and there, but the ef
fect of such Is lost In the open and gen
eral sympathy shown with the real lead
ers.
Tens of thousands of armed men are
openly drilling day by day. with the
avowed and explicit purpose of exter
minating all the Americans and Europeans
in the empire. The local officials every
where, with this going on before their
eyes, compel the head men of the village
to sign declarations that no Boxers are in
their district, and these declarations are
forwarded to Peking for foreign consump
tion.
Americans Unprotected.
Disorders such as these cannot be suf
fered to run unhindered in China without
the gravest possibilities of widespread
chaos. There was a time 'Â¦ last autumn
when the flame could have been stamped
out easily. To-day it is a conflagration
that will need the strongest measures to
extinguish. And unless pressure of the
most determined sort is brought to bear
at Peking, and this speedily, every inter
est of trade and commerce will soon be
imperiled. The Single American gunboat
at Taku or Chefoo will be five days' hard
journey from. the seat of the trouble, and
so far as any Immediate protection for
American citizens is concerned might- as
well be Hollo. It Is, however, a step In
the right direction. As for Germany's
power, to protect, her sphere of influence
Is farther from the present storm center
than is San Diego from Montreal, time
and difficulty of transit being considered.
The fact Is that, under the present
regime of reactionary Ignorance, China
has practically abdicated her governing
function in certain provinces, and unless
speedy reform ensues the only salvation
for her and for the Chinese themselves
will be In the very "partition" that Amer
ica deplores.

WILL STRIKE IN THE SPRING
Henry Kingman, Recently Arrived
From the Orient, Tells of a Plot
for the Slaughter of
Whites.
Sx>Â«cial Dissâch to Th* Call.
SAN DIEGO. March 24.â The Union of
this morning prints ac an interview with
Henry Klngman, the well-known English
newsp&per writer of the Orient, informa
tion regarding the eitua-tion in Northern
China which in part explains some of the
press dispatches which have recently been
Â¦cat out. Mr. Kingman says that there
Is a deplorable lack of Information in this
country of the conditions of the foreign
residents of some of the provinces of Chi
na and that that lack of information ex
tends even to official circles, though the
reports of the American Consuls in China
are beginning to be believed.
Mr. Kinnnan has lived in China for
many years and therefore knows of what
he speaks. In part of the interview he
cays that when the spring takes the pla.ee
of winter in those provinces there will
be atrocities that will startle the entire
country. The Chinese authorities are be
hind the rioters and their atrocities are
rewarded instead of punished. He says
that American lives and American inter
ests and the whole "open door" policy are
endangered and that unless something is
done to stem the tide every foreigner will
be swept oS the earth in that part of
China.
Lawlessness Unchecked.
Pille-ge and arson and murder have gone
en unchecked for months among the ad
herents of the Christian church, while the
Pekinr Government has been directly re
sponsible for this reign of terror and has
thwarted all the- efforts of the foreign
Ministers to brinp it to an end. A month
Q:o the leading English Journal In the Far
Bait declared editorially that unless strong
and united efforts were put forth by the
great powers it was morally certain that
the opening spring would witness a rising
such ac foreigners in China had never
seen before; that the whole country from
the Yellow Paver to the great wall and
beyond would be a blaze of insurrection
that would not only annihilate every for
eign Interest of every sort in the Interior,
but would drive every foreigner out of
Peking and Tientsin.
Since that time the situation haÂ» dis
tinctly grown worse. By its acts of this
last week the Chinese Government has
definitely defied the powers and declared
its policy of rewarding the high officials
who are responsible for the existence of
these armies of banditti.
Secret Societies Formed.
The situation began to be acute last
cummer. Large bodies of men In Shantung
and Chihli formed themselves Into a Â«ecret
Rocietj'. having as its motto the legend
"Protect the dynasty.exterminate the for
eigner." They are variously called the
*M3reat Sword Society" and the "Fist of
Public Harmony" â or. more commonly,
from this last title, "The Boxers." Their
avowed aim Is' to Sweep the foreigners
Into the Yellow Sea. as General Tung Fu
Hsiang begged to be allowed to do eight
een months ago. As the only foreigners
accessible to the Interior were the mis
sionaries, they have begun with them and
with the Christian converts among the
Deonle. It Is frcm this mere accident of

17A Pugnacious Teamster.
George Homer, a teamster, appeared In
Judge Mogan's court yesterday on a charge
of obstructing the street, and the case was
continued. Friday afternoon W. L. Welch,
driver of the ambulance, was driving along
Ninth street with a patient for the Re
ceiving Hospital, when Homer drove hla
team directly in front of the ambulance.
When remonstrated with he offered to
fight Welch and refused to remove his
team. He followed Welch to the ambu
lance stables on Park avenue and offered
again to fight him. Welch declined and
called in a policeman, who " arrested " the
pugnacious teamster.
Smuggled Goods on the Grant.
Six large packing cases containing val
uable bronzes and other curios from
Japan and China were seized yesterday
by customs Inspectors from among the
commissary stores that were being un
loaded from the Government transport
Grant. The packing cases were addressed
to Captain Buford of the Grant. As they
did not appear on the ship's manifest and
as the officers of the vessel had not notl
fleed the customs inspector in charge that
these dutiable articles were on board
Customs Surveyor Spear ordered the cases
and contents confiscated as smuggled
goods and taken to the Appraiser's store.
PROTESTS AGAINST
SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S
ADVANCE OF RATES
Los Angeles Express.
Th,e Southern j Pacific Company yester
day advanced the passenger rates between
L.os Angeles and San Francisco, first class,
from $13 to $15. â¢This action of the railroad
company came in the nature of a com
filete surprise," no previous intimation hav
ng been given, and the first the public
knew of it was when Intending purchasers
applied for tickets at the office they wero
informed that the new rate was in effect.
This Increase in the rate is an outrage
upon the traveling public," by which be
tween $400 and $500 a day is taken from the
people to further enrich a . corporation
which has grown fabulously, wealthy and
made millions for, its principal owners by
the bounty of the commonwealth.
1 No reason for this advance is given. Ths
railroad company simply holds up ihe
traveler and adds $2 more for a service
that is already liberally paid for.
Fresno Republican.
If the target shooterÃ do not come to
Fresno it will be the first of the series of
negative profits which the Southern Pa
cific will earn by its niggardly policy of
Increasing rates. The reduced fare was a
direct stimulus to traffic and a money
maker for the railroad; the increased fard
is a discouragement to traffic and will be
a money loser.
Nobody claims that the new fare Is ex
tortlonately exorbitant. It Is no more than
Is charged on most railroads, and Is rea
sonable Indeed In comparison with the pre
posterous freight rates we have to pay.
But It Is the established policy of this
State, embodied in its constitution, and is
a sound principle of good morals and good
business, that a railroad rate once put
down to meet, competition â¢ shall stay
down. The fact that there is a way of
evading the law by subterfuge in this case
does, not alter the substantial fact that
the action is against public policy and con
trary to the plain Intent of the law.
Merced Sun.
The raising: of rates by the Southern Pa
cific Company of fares between San Joa
quln Valley towns and San Francisco has
brought forth a storm of protest from the
people of the Interior, and a vigorous kick
is being made all up and down the line.
The increase In rates affects all the towns
south of Lathrop, and none of them seem
to like It. The newspapers are calling at
tention to the law, which says. that when
railroad fares are put down to meet com
petition they cannot be raised again with
out the consent of the Railroad Commis
sion. â¢-.â¢;<.-:..;.: .. " ;>-'.Â¦-.Â¦>.';
Madera Mercury.
The action of the Southern Pacific Rail
road in returning. to the old; rate of fare
between San Francisco and points In the
San Joaquln Valley will not be received by
the people with unalloyed pleasure. They
will feel more Inclined to howl, but ao far
as any good coming from it they may Just
as well save their strength, for the South
ern Pacific does not care much for the ob
jections of the railroad-ridden public.
There Is a lesson In this experience which
it would be well to profit by. It is to put
no faith In railroads: give them nothing
that they will not pay for, and pay well,
too. 'They have no sentiment In dealing
with the people, and the people should
have none In dealing with them.
If local burglars continue to progress much further
in daring it might be wise for the authorities to pro
vide watchmen for the police 'stations. The raid on
the California-street bank was dangerously close to
headquarters.
MR. REID'S ADDRESS.
PERHAPS there is no better illustration of the
confusion of ideas in the public mind as to the
new and dangerous issues raised by the Span
ish war than may be found in Mr. Whitelaw Reid's
charter day address at the State University. Mr.
Reid stands upon a public eminence. He has long
been editor of a leading American newspaper, has
been Minister to France, his party's candidate for the
Vice Presidency, and was a Commissioner to nego
tiate the treaty of Paris, which closed the ' Spanish
war and projected- its results into these days and far
into the future. His opportunity to get an unem
barrassed view of what the masses of the people see
fitfully has been exceptionally good, and yet his ad
dress has no clarifying effect whatever.
It was able in its structure, crisp and antithetical in
form, but vague and unsatisfactory in conclusion.
After all, it added only one more to the uncertain
sounds that are rising from all parts of the republic.
It cannot well be called a discussion of issues between
the two great political parties, for the subject under
discussion does not divide parties. Its cleavage runs
through the people regardless of party. Let cither
party attempt a dogmatic declaration upon the status
of our external dependencies, and it becomes at once
a house divided against itself. This shows that the
issue is fundamental and not partisan.
Mr. Reid declared that he would go no farther than
Jefferson and Lincoln. It is the fashion to plant
every novelty in policy in the authority of Jefferson
and Lincoln. Colonel Bryan has done this with each
monster that he has brought forth and baptized
"Democracy." Mr. Reid follows the same course.
Now Jefferson admitted that we might possess Cuba
and incorporate her into our system, because no en
largement of the navy would be required for her de
fense, and he said let that principle be the limit of
our expansion; add nothing that requires more navy
to defend. The annexation of Hawaii and conquest
of the Philippines are direct violations of the plainly
stated principles of Jefferson.
Mr. Reid's position is no more Lincolnian than it is
Jeffersonian. Discussing the future status of thesi
tropical islands, he scouted the idea of giving their
people political equality or admitting them as States.
As for Porto, Rico, he said: "Give her the best sys
tem for her situation and wants, because it is best for
her, and therefore our duty, not because it is under
the constitution of the United States her right." That
means that we are to judge what is best for Porto
Rico, and she is not to judge. That is autocratic
government in all of its essence, spirit and effect.
Again, he said: "But it is said that Porto Rico de
serves admission (as a State) because we are bound
by the volunteered assurance of General Miles that
they should have the rights of American citizens,
though there is no evidence that he meant more than
such rights as American citizens everywhere enjoy,
the civil rights which the genius of our government
secures to all who are capable of exercising them. If
he meant more, did that entitle him to anticipate his
chief and override in casual military proclamation
the supreme law of the land whose commission he
bore? Behind Porto Rico is Cuba, behind Cuba all
the other West India islands, and abreast of them the
Philippines. Regard. I beg of you, in the calm, white
light that befits these cloistered retreats of sober
thought, the degradation of the republic thus coolly
contemplated by the men who assure us we have no
possessions whose people are not entitled under our
constitution to citizenship and ultimately to state
hood!"
We beg to refer this part of the address to Regent
Barnes of the university, who has recently received
the wild approbation of the Union League Club of
Chicago by declaring that he knows of "no race of
people that is incapable of American citizenship."
But Mr. Reid continued: "The republican institu
tions in which we have been trained constitute a sys
tem only likely to endure among a people of high vir
tue and high intelligence. Such are its complications
and checks and balances, and interdependencies which
tax the intelligence, the patience and the virtue of the
highest Caucasian development, that it is obviously
a system absolutely unworkable by a group of tropi
cal and oriental races, more or less hostile to each
other."
Now, what does this all mean? Obviously that our
civil institutions are racial, and can be maintained
only where our race can exist and perpetuate itself.
It cannot exist in the tropics, therefore our institu
tions cannot exist there. The races found there by
nature will cause "the degradation of the republic" if
given a voice in its government! Verily an' anti
expansionist can rest his case on this expansion ar
gument. It is an avowal that these tropical and
oriental races can never assimilate and work our civil
system. Therefore we are always to . hold them in
dependence and subjection, without their consent
Yet Mr. Reid professes, to stand with Lincoln, who
said: "No man was ever good enough to govern
another man without that other man's consent." Still
we suppose that both Mr. Reid and Colonel Bryan,
having said that they stand with Jefferson and Lin
coln, will to the far end stand by their mumpsimus.

A STATISTICAL ABSTRACT.
rROM the statistical abstract just issued from
the Bureau of Statistics for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1889. it appears the year was in
several respects a record-breaker, the figures repre
senting results in various departments of nationa^
activity being the largest in our history.
The estimates of the bureau are that we had at the
close of the fiscal year a population of 76,011,000, and
on January 'I of this year 77,1 16,000. The census of
the year will test the accuracy of these estimates, but
it is hardly likely they will be found erroneous to
any considerable extent. We are increasing rapidly,
and it will not be many years before we can talk of
ourselves as a nation of 100,000,000, not counting the
inhabitants of the outlying colonies.
1 One of the points in which the year broke the rec
ord was that of governmental expenditures. It cost
us that year $700,093,564 to defray the expenses of the
National Government. To meet the expenditure we
had an income of $610,982,004. So there was a de
ficit of $88,1 11,560.That1 1, 560. That unsatisfactory condition of
affairs was largely due to the war.' Ordinarily of lafe
years the expenses of the War Department have been
about $50,000,000 annually, but in the year ending on
the 30th. of last June the expenditures of the depart
ment amounted to $232,395,365. The Navy. Depart
ment, cost $64,354,735/ or about double the usual
amount.
An interesting feature of the treasury statistics is
the showing that \ the receipts from internal revenue
taxes exceeded those from "customs dutiesâ the baa
President Wheeler of the University of California
is rapidly acquiring a knowledge of our institutions
and of the methods of those that rule us. He asked
the Southern Pacific Company for a student train
to Berkeley, and was told that the request would be
granted at some other time.
Because the drama of "Sapho" as presented in New
York has been condemned as indecent, , some wild
reformers have jumped to the conclusion the book is
equally bad, and now a member of Congress has
moved to have it excluded from the mails. As. the
book has been circulating in this country for
fifteen years or more, and has been universally*re
garded as one of the masterpieces of modern French
fiction, it would seem to be a little bit too late to have
a spasm over it now.
'The New York experts who declare it is safer for
the general public to bet on a roulette or a faro game
than on most of the racetrack events of . the time
evidently speak from experience.' The track gam
blers-do not carry their operations on for. pleasure
nor for the improvement of horses* but for the coin
that is in it, and they, give the public very slight
chances of winning anything worth having.
Three murderers of' this city have been released on
a "technicality." to ply again their terrible /. trade:
The practice of release is becoming common enough
to suggest that some. communities have a habit of in
viting dangerous characters to go elsewhere when the
courts are powerless.
The' more the country considers the problem of the
Porto Rican tariff thestronger becomes the conclu
sion that protection and imperialism cannot be made
to work together without a good deal of friction and
more or less kicking. ._. :. \'' ,

THE YELLOW PLAGUE.
THE various commercial bodies, of this city are
rr.oving none too soon to defend San Francisco
against the far-reaching harm that has been
done by the Board of Health and the Hearst twins,
the Examiner and Journal. It will be remembered
that The Call and Chronicle agreed to omit publica
tion of the sensational doings of the Board of Health
and the Chief oi Police, which occurred between
midnight and morning on the Bth inst., but the Ex
aminer not only refused to join this proper policy,
but wired the lying report to the New York Journal,
and thence spread it broadcast As if this were not
enough, Hearst's New York paper put in the time un
til the iSih inst- in preparing for a "plague edition,"
which it issued with two broad pages covered with
penny dreadful text and execrable pictures, intended
to horrify the reader and inflict the most possible
harm upon San Francisco. In circus poster letters
these two pages are headed: "The Black Plague
Creeps Into San Francisco." Then follow pictures.
One, "Where Wong Chut King Died of the Plague
in San Francisco." is a scene in a non-existing alley,
with a let of milkcans standing on the sidewalk, and
carrying the impression that the scene of King's
death is the source of the city's milk supply. Another
tawdry picture is the "Police Quarantine Cordon in
San Francisco's Chir.atown," representing a file of po
licemen using their clubs upon a surging mass of white
people who are crowding the ropes. There are also
six productions of horrible European pictures of the
plague as Death escorting all sorts and conditions of
men and women to the grave, all set in pious quota
tions from the Bible and other sources setting forth
the horrors of the plague. Under the subhead, "The
Historic Curse of Bible Times and the Middle Ages,*'
the fine writer of this production begins a long ar
ticle with this: "The bubonic plague, which now
threatens America, is the worst scourge humanity has
ever known. It is the plague which has afflicted the
world since the dawn of recorded history. Never be
fore has the black death succeeded in reaching the
shores of the New World, and its foothold in South
America this year and now on our Pacific Coast has
roused the united efforts of the United States hospital
service and the local quarantine officials." Then fol
lows a lot of ghastly stuff, cribbed from De Foe and
Richardson. Around the margin are interviews from
nearly thirty cities, with Mayors and other officers,
answering the Journal's question of what they will
do to protect themselves against San Francisco.
Boston says, "Now that the plague is in San Fran
cisco we shall be more alert than ever"; Fall River.
"All shipping from the Pacific Coast will be quaran
tined." Seattle :s: s not alarmed by "the appearance of
the dread bubonic plague in San Francisco," and
uses it to advertise the superior cleanness and advan
tages of that port. Washington proposes to put of
ficers at the California line to inspect all out-going
passengers by rail and turn back all suspects. And
so it goes through the round robin secured by Mr.
Hearst's yellow twin. They all assume that the plague
is here, and by thousands the vile pictures are sup
posed to represent its ravages in San Francisco.
We know of nothing that would inflict more dam
age upon California. The scare will injure the East
ern consumption of our fruit throughout the season,
and in every possible way that our interests can be
touched by Hearst's sensational lying they will be in-
LIPTON'S NEW CHALLENGE.
P^EPORTS that Sir Thomas Lipton proposes to
Iâ/ make another effort to carry off the America's
cup, and will ask the privilege of bringing two
yachts across the Atlantic to be tested in American
waters, so that he may make the contest with the win
ner of the two, have been favorably received by the
New York press, and it is probable the request will
be granted.
The rules governing the contests declare: "The
challenged club shall not be required to name its
representative vessel until a time agreed upon for the
start." But from the challenger, the deed requires a
ten months' notice in writing, and it adds: "Accom
panying the ten months' notice of challenge there
must be sent the name of the owner and a certificate
of the name, rig and following dimensions of the
challenging vessel, namely, length on load waterline,
beam at the load waterline, and the extreme beam and
draught of water, which dimensions shall not be ex
ceeded, and a custom-house registry of "the vessel
must be sent as soon as possible."
Under these rules the challenged club has consid
erable advantage over the challenger. For example,
in the last race, if in the trials the Britannia ha-d beater*
the Shamrock, Lipton would nevertheless have been
compelled to make the race for the cvp t with the
yacht he had challenged with ten months before,
while the Americans could, have defended the cup
with any yacht that might have proven speedier than
the Columbia. We have now beaten the British so
often, and Lipton has proven himself to be so thoi
ough a sportsman, there is an inclination in New
York to yield the advantage in our favor and let him
bring over two yachts for trial in New York waters
and make the race with the winner.
The request of the challenger has, in fact, been
treated with the best nature possible. The New York
Sun, for. example, says pleasantly: "Two visiting
yachts would make the popular amusement of book
keeping on their; expenses a positive delight. The
bills for two yachts and two crews and two tenders
were paid in behalf of America last year, the De
fender and Columbia having been fitted and tried in
their own waters; but the cost of sending a couple of
contestants across the ocean would be vastly more
staggering. But it would unquestionably increase
the chances of success, and of that we believe our
true-blue sporting friend, Sir Thomas, is more cove
tous than he is of â say half a million" pounds sterling."
The manner in which the request has been received
js a high compliment to Lipton. It is an evidence
that he has completely won the favor of the American
people, and that they are willing to give him every
thing he asks for in the name of fair play. It remains
to be seen whether" the New York Yacht Club has
authority to alter the rules without forfeiting the right
to the cup, but we may be sure there will be nothing
of an unsportsmanlike spirit that will move them in
deciding the point. ;Â¦Â¦./-

past has been, the most fruitful source of our rev
enue,.yielded but $206,128,482. ; : Â¦ ...
It has happened several times before. that internal
revenue taxes have exceeded the income from cus
toms, but on former occasions that result was due to
exceptional circumstances, which soon passed : away.
Now, however, the protective tariff has built -up a
manufacturing industry that well nigh- furnishes all
the manufactured goods required by bur population,
so that in the nature of things our imports will. not
be large enough in future to furnish the bulk of rev
enue required by the National Government. It .ia
probable, therefore that internal taxes will continue
for a long time to come. to hold their present pre
eminence over customs as a source of national in
come.
The monetary statistics are gratifying. At the close
of the fiscal year the amount of money in the United
States was $2,745,350,508, and of that amount there
was in circulation â that is to say, there was outside
the United States treasuryâ sl,oo4.o7l,BBl, "' We ex
ported domestic merchandise valued at $1,203,931,222,
and imported goods to the value of $697,148,489, leav
ing in our favor a balance of trade amounting to
$529,874,813. Of that sum, however, we had to -pay
back. to foreigners a' large portion in payment for
ocean freights, and it is therefore by no means pleas
ing to note that during the year our shipping in
creased only 2.41 per cent, and that of our total ex
ports less than 9 per cent was carried in our own
ships.
Some of the per capita figures are interesting. The
expenses of the Government cost us $9.21 each. We
paid in taxes' 'an average of $8.04 each. The public
debt at the* close Â¦of the year was $15.29 per capita.
The circulation of money was $25 per capita, and
that sum had never been exceeded, though the esti
mates are that on January 1 the amount had been
raised to $25.98 per capita.

General order No. 2. issued from the
headquarters of the First Infantry Regi
ment, shows that there has been a clear
ing up of the rolls. There have been hon
orably discharged from 'the regiment 117
non-commissioned officers and men who
belonged to the regiment at the outbreak
of the Spanish-American war and did not
volunteer therein and whose terms of en
listment had not expired and who did not

November; 136 whose term of service ex
pired, but who did not re-enter the regi
ment, and 840 who served.* in the Spanish-
American war, but did not report back on
or before November 30, 1899. In addition
there have been discharged ten on ac
count of removal, two at expiration of
term of service and one on account of ex
emption. One member has died. .
At their own request the following non
commissioned officers of Company M have
been reduced to the ranks: Quartermas
ter Sergeant Paul H. Sonntag and Ser-
f earns John W. Cobby and Emil C.

Twenty-one men nave been discharged
honorably from the Fifth Infantry for
various reasons. .Â¦â¢â¢Â¦:.:.-
The several brigade commanders have
been asked as to the most suitable time
for the division encampment, and from
the replies received. It seems that the
latter part of June will best suit the con
venience of all concerned.
It is said that the First Infantry will be
ordered out on Memorial day to decorate
the graves of soldiers. A number of the
men who belonged to that organization
are at rest In the National and other cem
eteries of this city. ,
As a result of the recent election for
colonel of â¢ the Second Regiment of In

Captain Bond of Chico, Captain Curson

the position of colonel, of the regiment
before the first' election and that they
have no faith In the statements made that
he had at the time of the first election
promised to vote for Colonel H. I. Sey
mour and had then failed to keep faith
with him. CQlonel Forbes himself, in a

NAVAL OFFICER
WILL WRITE OF
HIS CAPTIVITY
Lieutenant J. C. Gillmore
Offered a Large Sum
for a Story.
The Public to Learn of His Harrow?
ing Experiences While a Pris
oner of the Insur
gents.
Lieutenant J. C. Gillmore, the naval of
ficer who spent eight and a half months
in- captivity in the Philippines, will prob
ably make a small fortune in recounting
his adventures among the insurgents. He
was rescued last December by Colonel
Â¦Hare of the Thirty-third Infantry and a
party of picked men in the mountains in
the north of Luzon, and returned to this
city a fortnight ago on the naval trans
port Solace. '
Just prior to his departure for his home
in Washington last Thursday Lieutenant
Gillmore received two flattering offers for
a recital of his adventures in the Philip
pines. One was from a noted lecture man
ager, offering him $10,<j00 in cash for a
series of lectures through the large cities
of the country, extending over a period of
only a few weÂ«ks.
The other offer was from Appleton &
Co the publishers, for a written account
of Lieutenant Gillmore'B adventures, to
be published in book form. The amount
offered by Appleton & Co., Lieutenant
Gillmore says, is far in excess of that
offered by the lecture manager, and also
far more tempting 1 , because he knows
something about the use of a pen and has
had no experience whatever as a public
speaker. Aside from his disinclination to
enter the lecture fleld, Lieutenant Gill
more thinks that his superior officers
would not approve of such a proceeding.
Lieutenant Gillmore will have to rely
entirely on his memory in relating his
wonderful story. During the fifteen days'
trip down the river after the rescue of his
party in the mountains his raft was often
upset and he lost not only his carefully
kept Journal, but all of his ofilcial corre
spondence with General Tino and other
insurgent Philippine chiefs by whom he
was kept prisoner.
The only picture of special interest he
possesses is a photograph of himself and
party, taken on the day of their rescue by
an officer of the rescuing party who had a
camera and only one film left. When the
photograph was taken Gillmore was
standing on a rock, holding In his hand a
flag. which he and hls^comrades had made
in prison at the risk/ of their lives and
carried with them for months. The other
members \of the party were grouped
around the lieutenant.
Since his arrival in San Francisco Lieu
tenant Gillmore learned that the insurgent
officer who had his party in charge dr
lng the last two weeks of their captivity
had been captured and Is now a prisoner
at Manila, awaiting trial by court mar
tial. This officer, a young lieutenant, had
orders from General Tlno to shoot GUl
more and all of his party, but preferred
to abandon them, without food, in a sav
age country, because, as he told Gillmore,
"his conscience would not permit him to
carry out the order for the massacre."

BEACH MERRY-GO-ROUND
MENACES PUBLIC SAFETY
Machine South of the Ocean Beach
Pavilion Frightens Horses and
Endangers Pedestrians.
A menace to public safety and one that
Is certain to be the cause of, serious ac
cident Booner or later unless special pre
cautions are taken by drivers of teams
and pedestrians alike now exists out near
the Ocean Beach Pavilion In the shape
of a noisy, placard-displaying merry-go
round. This machine. Innocent enough In
Itself, Invariably strikes terror to the
passing teams. It is located across the
etreet Just south \>t the Ocean Beach Pa
vilion and takes up the entire corner
formed by the intersection '- of the beach
boulevard and the avenue leading from
the Market-street Railway Company's
depot to the main drive. Owing to the
fact that no fence or other structure has
been erected on the street side, and
through the fact that it is hidden on the
south side by the walls of the power
house, teams coming from that direction
bound for the Cliff House run upon the
machine without warning. The whang of
the piano-organ and the flapping of the
many placards as the machine Â¦ whirls
enjoyment into the hearts of the young
sters fall on the horses like a thunder
bolt and Invariably they leap from the
road and are plunging through the sands
toward the beach before the driver can
control them. To-day the beach will be
crowded with teams and pedestrians if
the weather remains clear, and It is safe
to say that one runaway caused by the
merry-go-round will leave behind some
Injured and possibly some dying
pedestrian. As the horses come upon the
machine so suddenly and swerve as sud
denly from the road there will be no
chance for escape for those who happen
to be on the beach side of the road, and
the iron roofs of some horse may cause a
death. Drivers in particular should be
careful to rein their horses In and get
them under control before attempting to
pass the merry-go-round, and pedestrians
should seek some other place away from
the road on the beachslde for their en
joyment until a fence or other shelter
hides the machine from view.
As the merry-go-round is Â¦ on private
property the Park Commissioners have no
control over the way in which it Is man
aged. Several complaints have been
made, however, and doubtless the owners
of the machine will be asked to fence
the same in; a request which should be
immediately complied with if accident is
to be avoided. ,

NO BLAME CAST
ON THE BOARD
FOR THE ERROR
Examination for Chief Clerk
of Sub-Treasury Is
"Canceled.
Another Trial to Be Had With Mr.
Jacobs as One of the Civil Ser
vice T^a ml fling Com
mission.
â¢ Â» .
I Assistant Treasurer Jacobs at the Sub-
Treasury In this city has received a dis
patch, a letter and a printed circular from
the Civil Service Commission at Washing
ton announcing that the examination held
recently- in this city for the civil service
position of chief clerk in the United States
Sub-Treasury In this port had been can
celed because it appeared that the'exam
ination papers containing the questions
had been prematurely opened by Manuel"
Eyre through inadvertence. The letter
went on to state that several persons who
had taken part In the examination had
filed protests with the department, but
that the department had found nothing In
the facts that could militate against the
good name or the fairness of the local
board of examiners.
The circular imparted the unexpected
Information that Assistant Treasurer Ja
cobs might add to the examination ques
tions others on such subjects pertaining
to the duties to be tilled as he may deter
mine. . . .
Mr. Jacobs mailed a letter yesterday to
the commission at Washington asking for
more definite instructions regarding his
powers and dutleÃ in the matter of the
proposed new examination. It will be re
membered that at the examination which
the commission has Just canceled a
brother of Mr. Jacobs and a son of Cus
toms Collector Jackson were among the
applicants. When the discovery was made
by Thomas P. Burns, cashier of the Sub-
Treasury and member of the examining
board, that the packet containing the ex
amination questions had been opened be
fore the proper time the class protested
and Candidate Jacobs retired from the ex
amination before its conclusion.
The date of the new examination will be
announced by the commission at Wash

That You Don't Get Killed If You Go
to Wax.
War is not such a dangerous game as
people think. In spite . of all efforts to
annihilate each other, enemies do com
paratively â¢_ slight damage. During the
Franco-German war, with Its 'scores of
battles on a vast scale, only; 19ft '.men In
each 1000 were killed nnd 108 wounded,
while i\i per 1000 were missing. -Thus any
soldier ? engaged had < about - nine â¢ chances
to one that he would not get a scratch;
and over fifty chances Â¦to â¢* one Â¦* that ; he
would not be killed.- Most of the wounds
received were slight â that Is to say, one
fourth of all the wounds were severe and
three-fourths were slight. But It is sur
prising how small a wound disables a man
and knocks him out of the ranks.

Yankee Team Captures the
International Match

Needs but One More Victory to Ee
tain Permanent Possession of
the Sir George Newnes
NEW YORK, March 24.â For the third
time America has *ron the Anglo-Ameri
can cable chess match out of five matches
played. The score of six wins to four Is
the same as was m>ide last year. The in
ternational chess Championship cup do
nated by Sir George Newnes will remain
here for another year, and it takes only
cue additional victory to make It a per
i:ianent possession.
The contest was spirited throughout.
England scored first blood. Then it looked
as If America would achieve an over
whelming victory, but later in the dajr it
was a question whether America would be
able to win the match by one narrow
point. The whole Issue hinged on the
game between Pill'bury and Blackburn
and the contest be* ween Bellingham and
Hodges. Blackburn, by very fine play re
gained a pawn lo*.< In the opening and
finally had the be&cr position; but not
sufficient to win. â¢. 'lodges had been put
on the defensive foi.'a day and a half, but
finally by excellent Splay succeeded in es
tablishing a won g*jne. Seeing that tht>
match would have Ceen won for America
anyhow he offered :a draw, which, how
ever, was not accepted. The gallant Eng.
llshman resigned instead.
Chess clubs from} Boston to California
and from Maine to jrexas were represent
ed by one or more delegates.
Tho veteran Delntar gave an exhibition
of chess prowess v(hich to elder players
recalled the days wlien he was considered
champion of the United States. Playing
with sterling brilliancy, yet with sound
ness, he forced Trenchard to lower his
colors.

LONDON. March 25.â The Cafe Monaco
presented a - brilliant scene this evening,

announced that the fifth match had been
won by the American team by six games
to four, and proposed three cheers for. the
Americans. aaSÃssiCgfiÃS
The rooms were crowded with the lead-
Ing English and Continental chess play
ers, who displayed the 'greatest Interest,
particularly wheji, at 10 o'clock, .. it was
noted that the " match was a tie. Soon
after this Delmar defeated Trenchard,
giving the Americans an extra point. This
left the veteran Blackburn against PlUs
bury and Bellingham against Hodges. The
announcement of a draw game between
Blackburn and Pillsbury gave great satis
faction to the friends of ; the - veteran,
although it decreased Great Britain's
chances of success. Bellingham a . few
minutes later resigned in favor of Hodges,
fivlng the American team the advantage

BRYAN WILL
PROBABLY MOVE
INTO TEXAS
Has Already Expressed a
Preferment for That >
State.
Asserted by Democrats That He
Would Be Welcomed There If
Again Defeated for the
Presidency. â¢ * i '
OMAHA, March 24.â A special to the Bee
from Washington says: There Is seem
ingly good reason for believing that Wil
liam J. Bryan is quietly making arrange
ments to move to Texas in the event of
his defeat for President. Â¦
The Texas delegation in Congress, and
more particularly Senator Culberson and
Representative Bailey, look upon Bryan's
movements with considerable trepidation,
and see in his quiet trips to the Lone Star
State much to arouse suspicion. Bryan's
children are going to school in Austinl
They are in love with the State, bo It is
said, as Is also Mrs. Bryan. Colonel Bryan
appeals to the emotionalism of the South
erners to a remarkable extent; and, In
point of fact, his temperament savors
more of the South than of the North.
A Texas Congressman to-day said that
Bryan was the idol of his people and that,
should he meet defeat at the polls, losing
Nebraska as well as the nation, he saw
no. other future for the Nebraska states
man than for him to move to the Imperial
commonwealth of Texas and take up his
residence with the people who honor him
for the fight he made for silver.
"Should Bryan decide to move to
Texas." sajd the Congressman, "he would
at once take a prominent place in the
councils of the Democratic party, and, so
warm-hearted are our people over wrongs,
It would not surprise me to see him dis
place Culberson, ChUton and Bailey In the
leadership and become the. dictator of
Democratic politics In the Lone Star
State. Bryan must realize that, with Ne
braska lost to him, he stands but little
show for future preferment, and he can,
with honor to himself and to the State,
turn -his eyes toward. Texas, whose Dem
ocracy is unquestionable and unquench
able. * . -.. â

were seized. Mr. Truth to-day asked that
this property be returned to him. Mr.
Casey decided to give him whatever cash
there was, but he held the money orders.

up to the time of his arrest have now
commenced to dwindle away, but almost

"A short time ago I was called to a
patient who had been given up by his
physician: his stomach would not bear
food and consequently he got no nour-
ishment and was slowly dying from ex-
haustion. He was reduced to skin and
bones. I immediately put him on
Grape-Xuts food and Postum Cereal
* Food Coffee; he could keep both ar-
ticles on his stomach and neither
caused him any pain. He has been using
both the food and the cereal coffee and"
has gained so rapidly that I feel he will
be out of bed in about a week." Dr. C.
Leutwein.
The reason a delicate stomach can
take Grape-Xuts food is that it is pre-
digested by natural means during its
preparation, and even a small babe can
handle it. as it causes no heavy work by
the stomach and digestive appara-
tus. _ On the contrary, being prcdigest-
ed, it is quickly assimilated into blood
and tissue.
The food as well as the Postum Food
Coffee contains elements selected 'â¢ from
the grains of the field that are of first
importance to the human body in nour-
ishing and rebuilding it
All grocers keep Grape-Nuts and
Postum.

Grant Accepted the Criticism.
An Interesting anecdote of General
Grant is told In - Sir Edward -. Russell's
book of reminiscences. Just published and
entitled "That Reminds Me," says the
New York Mall and Express.' It seem 3
that when General Grant visited; Liver
pool on his famous trip around the world
the Mayor of the city received : a letter
from an unknown man, asking, with many
apologies for the intrusion, . a ; few mo
ments' conversation with the general. The
Mayor hesitated, but showed the letter
to the great soldier.. "Certainly," said
Grant, Instantly, "let the gentleman
come." .
He came and plunged at once into the
midst of the matter which 'evidently was
of such immense interest to him.
"Now, sir," he said to the general, "ut
ter amateur'as I am, I have followed
every step of the war, and think I under
stand every movement' except one. On
such a day you were there and the South
erners were there"â pointing, to plans on
a map that he" had brought. . "Now, It
seems to me that you ought; certainly to
have gone there, whereas you went there"
âpointing againi â¢ Â¦-Â¦-< Â¦Â«Â¦Â¦< Â¦-- Â¦:?
General Grant, the usually taciturn, and
when not taciturn â¢; phenomenally â¢ terse,
Just took the cigar from his ; mouth and
said : "You're right, sir. Damned - blun
der!", And in a moment the 'Â¦ amateur
strategist, beaming now, was courteously
dismissed. -.^BtHtfitHVSUStSKBSSBtgi

KRUTTSCHNITT
DEFENDS THE
RELIEF PLAN
Says the Railroad Is Not
Forcing Its Employes
Into It.
Delegation Will Meet Him in This
City and Bequest That the
Scheme Ba Aban
doned.
S;*k:lÂ«J DlagtLtea to TtÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 24.-C P. Hunt-
Ingtoh, when questioned concerning the
I>roposÂ«<3 relief Insurance plan, referred*
the Inquirer to General Manager Krutt-
Kchnltt.
"The company has no Intention now and
never contemplated to rÂ«cede from its
position Â«s first taken In the matter of thÂ«
relief plan for our employes," Krutt
echnltt said. "The circulars as posted
speak for themselves, and the additional
circular that was issued on March 6 by
telegraph after the meeting of the divi
sion superintendents, at which Mr. Muir
Â¦was present to further explain the com
pany's plan, emphasizes our position' and
intention. V. r e have not found cause to
â¢withdraw the proposed plan of relief that
benefits the employes."
When informed that meetings had been
held at various towns by Southern Pacific
employes and that they protested against
the action of tne company, Kruttschnitt
eaid:
"No cause for unrest should come to our
Â«*rnployes. Those who do not wish to sign
the agreement need not. We shall not
u.Â«e a cudgel to drive any one. The com
pany is not in this to make money for it
eelf, but is following the plans as adopted
by the Baltimore and Ohio and Pennsyl
vania Central. Not a man on those Une3
would to-day go without the protection
that is offered by the system, that is be
yond the stage of experiment. "The Infer
ence was not disguised that in the future
every man entering the company's employ
â¢would be called upon to sign the agree
ment before his name appeared on the
payroll.
"If A. B and C out of 100 men who apply
do not wish to comply with the company's
known requirements and regulations. P.
R. S and Z will, and you will never find
lhÂ« company at a standstill because it
larks sufficient men to run every depart
ment.** - ;;â¢ -v';
The Call is in a position to state
that es soon as Manager Kruttschnitt
returns to the city he will be waited
npon by a delegation of seventy-five
employes of the road, representing
the various organizations of train
men, shop and yard employes, who
will demand of him that the insur
ance plan be abandoned.

NICHOLSON
WITHDRAWS HIS
FAMOUS SUIT
Has Been Before the Supe

Three Decisions Have Been Given in
â¢ His Favor and Each Reversed
. \ by the Supreme
Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. March 24.â The suit of Mur-
doch i Nicholson vs.. Winifred C. Tarpey
et aL, "which ha 3 been pending In the
Superior Court, of -this county for twenty
years and decided three times for plain
tiff and as [ many, times reversed by the
â¢ Supreme r Court, vvras dismissed Thursday
On motion of : Attorneys Morehouse * and
Hambly for plaintiff.
7 The case has been a sensational onÂ© and
.full . of tragedy. Nicholson's wife waa
shot by John Tarpey, . husband â¢of the
principal defendant, 'and in turn Tarpey
was lynched for the crime. The suit grew
out of a land Â¦ transaction in Monterey
County.: Nicholson, who lived- in San
Francisco, purchased a tract of land from
Tarpey. He supposed, it is alleged, he
was buying. 76o acres of land, but when
he sent his* wife down to occupy It. - it
was found only 320 acres had been trans
ferred |to him. â¢.*: Trouble arose 5 over the
matter and in a quarrel one day with
Mrs. Nicholson , Tarpey shot her. A day
or "two later Tarpey was lynched by the
citizens of that section. Before being
hanged he denied ' any intent of killing
Mrs. Nicholson and said he had flred at
Nicholson's hired man, who had attempt
ed to shoot,. and just as he, pulled the
trigger Mrs. Nicholson stepped in front
of the hired man. - .Â¦Â¦ * :
The suit In question was then brought
against Taroey's widow to recover the
balance of the land alleged to have been
purchased. While this famous suit was
dismissed, it is not the end of this long
litigation, for another suit Is pending in
Monterey County.

HOUSE PASSES
THE PORTO RICAN
RELIEF MEASURE
De Vries of California Among
the Democrats Who_ ] r . r ..
Vote "Aye."
Adoption of a Resolution Looking
Toward the Erection of a
Memorial to General
Grant.
WASHINGTON. March 24.â After a
brief and spirited debate the House to
day took the last Congressional step In
completing the Porto Rlcan bill, agreeing
to the conference report by, a vote of 135
to 67. The bill turns over to the Presi
dent, for the use-of Porto Rico, about
$2,000,000 of customs receipts collected on
Porto Rican goods up to January 1 last,
and such amounts as may hereafter ac
crue until otherwise provided by law. The
debate lasted but an hour, but in this
time the" whole range of Porto Rican leg
islation was discussed.
McÃae of Arkansas, . a member of the
conference committee, spoke in opposi
tion to the report and severely criticized
the general course of recent legislation
toward Porto Rico. He read the resolu
tion of the lowa House of Representa
tives, condemning the Porto Rican tariff
bill, and those of â¢ the New York : Board
of Trade on the. same subject. In every
solemn crisis, he said; the American peo
ple might be ' relied upon to make - their
wishes known in unmistakable terms.
Such a crisis was now at hand' and Porto
Rico, having asiied a fulfillment of prom
ises and an opportunity to relieve her
distressed people's was :to be given this
opportunity in the form of a relief bill.
"Will the American people submit to
this outrage?" he asked. "If the leaders
of the party In power, believe the people
do not understand this question they will
speedily their mistake."
Press Editorials Barred.
Pierce of Tennessee, Wilson of South
Carolina, Cochran of Missouri and Cox
of Tennessee also . opposed the report.
Richardson, the Democratic floor leader,
asked leave to print in the Record some
editorial press criticisms on the | subject.
Dolliver of. lowa objected. Richardson
declared that this was most ungracious, to
which Dolliver answered that he doubted
the propriety of reprinting newspapers In
the Record. - ; Â¦ ; .â¢ â¢
Williams -of Illinois'. Ridley of Kansas,
Levy of New York and Finlay of South
Carolina followed. In opposition to the re
port. Several of the speakers made refer
ence to a published report that the Porto
Rico ; tariff bill was designed to secure
campaign funds. Payne of New "York,
chairman of the Ways and Means ; Com
mittee, denied the, report that any cam
paign fund, was designed , in the' bill, and
Renounced as . false the statement that
such reports emanated from members on
the Republican side of the. chamber. -\ ,
Cannon of Illinois closed .the debate in
support of the conference. He declared
that the . minority, like : cuttlefish; were
trying Â¦to muddy the waters and divert
attention from themselves. But the peo
ple would recognize the fact that the mi
nority opposed - this - practical r measure of
relief to the Porto Rlcans. For a half
century the - Democratic policy ( had ; been
one which would have carried the Govern
ment to anarchy and destruction, y: Now
that party was posturing - and ; asking
power- under false pretenses. ' There -was
great applause and laughter ; as Cannon
closed with the â declaration that .-â¢ the
American people would not be deceived by
this posturing, but "would kick you out

that Saturday afternoon, April 14, be set

Preparations for the street carnival are
progressing so rapidly that every day dis
closes more vividly the Immensity of, the

Justify the belief that the carnival will be
one of great beauty and Â¦ Interest. The
Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden
West, who gave such a successful Dewey
day floral festival last year, have resolved
to combine that feature with the street
carnival this year, and it is over this ex
hibition of Sacramento's floral wealth
that the queen now being voted for with
such spirit is to reign.

SACRAMENTO, March 24.â The vot
ing to-day for May Queen showed
Miss May McAdams In the lead, and
her friends assert that there could
not be a fairer ruler for the floral
parade, which is to be one of the leading
features of the approaching street fair
and trades carnival, j Miss McAdams Is of
a type midway between blonde and bru
nette, and Is tall and graceful. So spir
ited has the voting grown that it Is not
improbable that the choice of to-day will
not be the choice of to-mprrow, although
the lead has been Â¦ shared the past . few
days by Miss McAdams and Miss M.

the list.

VICTORIA. B. C, March 24.â Now that
all the world Is talking of the heroic deeds
of the Naval Brigade at Ladysmith 1 and
all the illustrated papers are printing the
portrait of ' Captain Lambton, R. N.. who
divided the honors with ' General White
for the successful defense of the Natal
town against such large odds, : Victorians
are recalling many stories of the little
captain who was here some years ago in
command of the Warsplte when that ves
sel was the flagship on this station. Lady
smith is not the only siege at which" he
has won glory, although In the otherâ of
which naval men on this coast still talk â
he was not with. the beleaguered forces
and not himself exposed to the shot and
shell. It was in the bombardment of
Callao that Captain Lambton became first,
known to fame, and never will he be for
gotten by the people of that port and
others along the Chilean coast.- Because
of the -part he played in the memorable
tihllean revolution a statue of the captain
was erected some years ago, and still
adorns one of the plazas of Callao. It
would not be well for any one, to profess
Ignorance of Captain Lambton at Callao,
Corlnto, Iqulque or anywhere in that
vicinity, for Captain Lambton Is both hero
and demigod in Chile.
It was when Captain Lambton was sta
tioned at Esquimau as flag captain of the
Warsplte, then the flagship of Admiral
Hotham, that she played her part in the
historical and dramatic events culminat
ing in the revolution. Hostilities were in
progress when the Warsplte , went to Cal
lao and the town was then under bom
bardment by several of the old Govern
ment ships, some of which were after
ward destroyed by the revolutionists.
Scanning the bombarded town with his
glasses, Captain Lambton saw that there
were women and children huddled about
the streets, where shells were shrieking
and screaming, carrying death and de
struction to the Chileans and the women
and children. Captain Lambton'a humane
feelings and his indignation that such
things were permitted under the name of
war were at once aroused and he at once
signaled to the bombarding ships to cease
firing until he removed the women and
children. No attention was paid to the
string of signals flown from the Warspite
and the bombardment continued. Down
came the signals and more were run up.
This time the signal was a command, not
a request. The flags read, "Cease firing
until women and children can be removed
or we shall open flre on you." At the
same time an otricer was dispatched from
the Warsplte to the firing Chilean ship
and then the orders were given from the
bridge of the British ship to clear the
decks for action. The guns were un
masked and ammunition hurriedly brought
up. ; The crew tumbled to quarters with
enthusiasm, naked as the men who fought
with Nelson's fleet.
It was only for a moment. The Chileans
saw that the British: wardogs were
aroused and were prepared to more than
show their teeth. The cannonading ceased
as If by magic and before the boat had
got back to the warship from the Chilean
vessel the harbor was clear of; smoke.
Then a landing . party was formed and
amid the cheers of the town the British
tars, headed by Captain Lambton. saw to
the safe bestowal of the non-combatants.
It was for this act that Captain Lambton
was made a demigod by the people of
Chile and his name made the synonym re
vered as a. knight of modern chivalry. . It
is for this act that the statues. have been
erected in the plazas and for this that
he enjoys the freedom of nearly all the
towns of Chile. A cheery, whole-souled
fellow in the clubs or wardroom, a lion in
battle and as tender-hearted as a' woman
to the weak and helpless, such is the Cap
tain, the Hon. Hedworth Lambton, hero
of Callao and hero of Ladysmith.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 24.-Collls P.
Huntington, president of the Southern
Pacific, who has come to the coast to at
tend the annual meeting of directors at
San Francisco in April, spoke to-night in
no uncertain terms on the question of ex
pansion, nor did he shrink from uttering
a loyal sentiment In behalf of President
McKinley. ,-.%Â£
"It Is never too late to deprecate even
if we would the action of our Government
resulting from the recent war with
Spain," the magnate said. "I am not one
of those who like to put chucks under the
wheels of progress; nor do I believe in
trying to defeat the aims of my Govern
ment after it has taken a decided step
and is committed to a policy. I am not
one of those who, while our soldiers are
lighting under the American flag in the
Philippines, would aid the enemy by de
of the Government. I believe in uphold
ing the President's hands in the march he
is leading, and I am always for tne flag,
whether at home or abroad.
"This country has a great work to do.
War cairn; and . went, and I believe It is
better for the world that the islands that
came to us as the result of that war
should be under the stars and stripes
than that they should have remained un
der the tlag of Spain, as it ought to be â
and 1 believe will beâ better for the peo
ple of these islands to be with us, and
better lor us, provided we should deal
fairly and liberally with them, for the.*
vviij rarely pay us in kind.
"All the islands that we" have taken we
must keep and deal with their people nrm
ly but kindly so that they will not only
love but respect us. Let us give to tne
Filipinos a good government that will be â¢
an object lesson to all the people of East
ern Asia. In doing this we shall widen
our sphere of influence so that the mil
lions of people in China will welcome our
incoming, knowing that we mean them no
harm, l^et us ask all the peoples of the
world to join with us in giving to the
Chinese such moral support, -if nothing
else, as [ will induce , them to build up out
of the material they have a great homo
geneous empire with all the doors of com
merce open to all the nations of- the
earth."
Opposes the Isthmian Canal.
Willie Mr. Huntington favors the open
door and the supporting of the adminis
tration, he opposes the building of the
Nicaragrian canal.
"The time to expostulate," he said, "is
now, before anything is done by the Gov
ernment toward building the Nicaragua
canal, and every citizen has a right to say
what he thinks. With "the first shovelful
of earth to start the work the people will
be committed to a work that will cost
more millions than they dream of and
more lives than all the work done since
man has existed. I place the cost at $250,-
OuO.OOO and can only Bee a small income to
pay the Interest, without reckoning the
cost of maintenance.
"They tell us that the Nicaragua canal
is a military necessity, but I think not;
in fact, I think the arguments against
It on military grounds ought to be con
vincing. With such a canal open to ail
the nations of the earth, in time of war
none of them would have an advantage
over the other. AH the great nations of
Western Europe could send their ships
of war through it so as to reach our west
ern coast, ear in twenty-five days. With
out the canal, they would have to send
their battleships around Cape Horn or
go through the Straits of Magellan, oc
cupying say eighty days, and the enemy
could prevent our using the canal the
same as we could prevent their using it,
so that It would ""seem to me that the
best thing to be done in time of war
would be to blow up the locks in order
that no ships could use the canal.
"I do not believe In the Nicaragua canal,
because I have made a study of the
question after an experience of sixty odd
years in business life. I believe that In
advocating the enormous expenditure re
quired to build the canal the American
people will be making a costly mistake,
financially and commercially, and an
enormous blunder In military policy."
Southern Pacific's Political Code.
When Mr. Huntington was asked
whether the Southern Pacific was out of
politics, it seemed to be a new inning at
the bat that he long had sought.
"The Southern Pacific Is not in politics
has never been in politics, as the term is
used in California," Huntington remarked;
"but when it comes to interfering, with
our Interests or demanding that we sub
mit to wrongful policies the company
meets the occasion with a shotgun policy
and halts the enemy. The principle of
self-preservation is the Inherent right of
all Individuals, and the - theory that it
should not extend to corporations must
have a new Interpretation before it Is
believed on our system. We are not mak
ing politicians, and neither are we break
ing political slates. We have our own ball
of yarn to knit on. We only knock back
when some one bumps our heads."
Huntington says that the coast line will
be completed by November. He declares
that the report of a combination between
the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific Is
too silly to be seriously treated, and says
that as the forfeiture of the San Pedro
harbor contract was made while he was
In Guaymas. he had no flnger in its abro
gation, no matter how" much the public
might believe to the contrary.
Before he retired Huntington conferred
with W. F. Herrin, J. C. Stubbs, William
Sproule. Julius Kruttschnitt and John
Muir of Los Angeles. In reply, to an in
quiry regarding the construction and com
pletion of the Carson and Colorado line,
lately acquired from D. O. Mills, he said
that the line would be constructed from
Mojave to Keeler. While the plans were
well formulated, orogress might be slow,
owing to the high price of steel and the
inability of foundries to take large con
tracts for bridge work.
Mr. Huntington will â¢ leave for Santa
Barbara to-morrow and. may also visit
Santa Monica. A run as far as Goleta
will be made on the new coast division.
It Is commented upon that President Rip
ley of the Santa Fe also is resting at
Santa, Barbara.

terday Mrs. Friedlander sued for divorce,
alleging failure to provide and cruelty as
causes of action.
In her complaint Mrs. Friedlander al
leges that on June 28, 1896. she abandoned
her maiden name of Miss Nora Agnes
Stanton and by virtue of the decree of a
Justice of the Peace became Mrs. Fried
lander. Subsequently, she says, her hus
band began to neglect her, and when on
the 4th inst. he struck her she decided to
strike for liberty, and with her child, Es
ther, aged 2 years, fled from the home he
had provided.
Frledlandor claims that his marital woes
are the result of his wife's relatives' de
sire to interfere in his family, which, he
says, have bÂ«en plainly manifest ever
since his trother-ln-law compelled him to
escape with his bride through a window
at the conclusion of the ceremony mak
ing them irian and wife.

portion of the community property, con
sisting of a black dress, a silver-plated
clock and two rings. Mrs. Gorham se
cured a decree of divorce from her hus
band a few months ago and was awarded
the custody of her property. The cus
tody of the property, however,' rested with
Gorham, and he failed to obey the decree
of the court. Mrs. Gorham was confident
that she would see him go to Jail for con
tempt and also recover the property,- but
her hopes have been blasted, for Gorham
has evaded the Sheriff.
Gretchen Ebellng has sued Helnrich

709 Point Lobos avenue, he cruelly beat
their child, and on August 10 took a horse

formerly In command of the ship Domin

he was enjoying his honeymoon the Do
minion started from Honolulu for Vicio

by Lloyds', Captain Meredith took com

The barkentine Catherine Sudden is now being made ready for a voyage to the gold fields and her owners propose
to revolutionize the handling of freight at Nome. A donkey engine has been placed amidships on the vessel and two more'
are stowed away carefully In the hold. Six surf boats, each capable of carrying thirty tons dead weight, "are to go on
deck, while a large can buoy and a well-tested cable will be stowed in the hold. . ... ,
When the Catherine Sudden reaches Cape Nome the can buoy will be securely anchored about a mile from the beach.
The two Bta.tlonary engines will be landed and placed In position on the beach and then the cable-. will 'be laid. â¢ It will
run from the engines to the buoy, and while tho engine is paying out the other will be hauling In. In this way the barges
will be kept coming and going, and it is figured that a vessel once securely tied up to the buoy will be able to unload'about
750 tons a day into the barges and thence to the beach.
The Catherine Sudden will carry no passengers and only about 500 tons of freight outside of what her owners are
sending north. >:. â¢Â¦

H.S. FOOTE MAY NOT BE
REAPPOINTED A REGENT
X A. Denicke and F. W. Henshaw
Mentioned for. Long Term on
the University Board.
Henry S. Foote's term as Regent of the
State University expired on March 1, but
Governor. Gage. at last accounts had not
appointed his successor. A short time ago
John E. Budd of Stockton was reappoint
ed f or a : f ull term of sixteen years. His
commission was presented at the last
meeting of the board. ;
There '- seems to be an jmpresslon that
Mr. . Foote will . not be reappointed, as
there are several | candidates mentioned
for. the position which he now holds. For
example, Colonel E. A. Denicke, Regent
ex-officio by virtue of being president of
the Mechanics' Institute of San Francis
co, desires to be a real, live, full-fledged
sixteen-year term Regent.
A petition long enough to span the dis
tance from The Call building to the water
front has been signed by Mr. Denicke's
fellow citizens and in , due time will be
presented to the. Governor. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢
But Colonel Denicke is not the only man
mentioned to succeed Mr. . Foote. Judge
F. W.- Henshaw has many earnest sup
porters in San Francisco and Oakland,
who have resolved that the Governor
shall be enlightened as to the special and
general merits of their champion. It is
said that Judge Henshaw is not seeking
tho appointment, but nevertheless his
friends insist that the university shall
have the benefit of , his experience and

trouble, it la. feared, will result
from the arrest In Chinatown last Tues
day of Moon Tong,- a Chinese woman, by
officers from Visalia. . Friends of . the
woman in this city are decrying the ac
tion as the work of kidnapers, and a clash
seems imminent. Advices Â¦ received from
Visalia, where the woman was taken, 3ay
tha sv the Bame condition of affairs exists
at that place. â¢ . ,
It is alleged that the charros on which
tne woman was arrested were trumped
up solely for the puropse of getting her
put of ban Francisco , and then kidnap

procured, -but the woman's friends claim
that she has been a resident of this city

Highbinders were conspicuous in the
streets of Chinatown last night. Most of
them were members of the Suey Sing tong
a "d they were after a wealthy leader of
the Hop Sing tong named Gow Chung,
proprietor of a resort known as the City
of Peking. The police were immediately
notified, and Sergeant of Police Mahoney
watched the place for several hours
searching all suspicious parties.
The Suey Sing tong has recovered from
its crippled condition, due to the arrest of
several of its leading hatchetmen, and
yesterday a number of professional mur
derers from interior points arrived in the
city to take tbeir places. They started
out to do business early, but were. all soon
under police surveillance.
A Suey Sing man pointed out three Chi
nese, Wo Such, .Wong Yo and Hong Fook,
as being the murderers of Chan Sue, who
was killed on Jackson street on March 1.
Detective Ed Gibson arrested the men and
placed ' them on the email book at the
California-street police station pending
