was natural that M. -A.! Dorn should I>q

l^rience with a bank and. with bankers."
He knows what It is to secure Interest
Â«>n an investment, and he wasspeaking-to
a banker. Mr. Dorn knows what, it is for
manipulators to rob and cheat the public
in order that Interest may be regular. He
has heard the plea of defrauded prople;
he has become callous to the cry. of -le-.
celved men and women; he knows of men
who ended ihelr distress of wrecked, lives
in Fuicide. And- he knowe. also, that when
the - clamor of- public . Indignation was
raised against the men who preyed on .the
city And .the lash -of denunciation wan
aimed at the conspirators It struck Vis
liack. Consequently he was In a mood yes
terday to Jter at those who opposed . his
plot and to sympathise with Mr. Tobin
when that worthy gentleman said that be
felt "jo<.ose." .
Mr. Dorn had all the craft of the law
yer in his petition, although he in no way
surpassed the attorney for Mr. Tobin. In
brief, Mr. Dorn asked that a bill closing
all poolrooms and opening Inglesiae for
eighty days at a license of $20 a day be
re-commended for adoption. _ He did not
waxt eighty days, but thought that the
public would be blinded into, a beUef that

in the racetrack represented that they

entitled to reap benefits therefrom. He

"No," replied Dr.. Dllle; "the racetrack

Â¦ And then Dr. .Nelander spoke with an
apology that he came as a clergyman.
But" he wanted the committee to know
that he.has-met all classes', all manner
of men, and . within ' the . last week had
heard a unanimity of opinion, .such. as he
had never heard before,- that lupleside's
Rambling should'ndt again be tolerated In
San Francisco..- He said he spoke with
no exaggeration when he said that 10.000
families In San Francisco do not- want the
irack. reopened andF the -blessing', of .last
year replaced by a curse. â¢ " .
"When you speak of men being ruined
by Ingleside, aren't you thinking of other,
tracks?" asked .Tobin.
"I am thinking 1 "," was the minister's re
ply, "of the men whose career in ' crime
began within the gates of Ingleside and
.ended in the penitentiary."

understood that a gross discrimination
had been made against Ingleside Track:
that it had been closed while the pool
rooms had. been allowed to thrive openly
and unmolested: that the tracks of Oak
land and Tanforan were as accessible as
Ingleside, the reopening of which would
not Increase, gambling In this city. . "Â¦Â¦
"Yes, our poolrooms are â¢Â¦ flourishing,"
added Tobin, who could not resist the
opportunity to support the deliberate mis
representation of Reed. If either of them
thought, to deceive the ministers he was
mistaken. They could not. be blinded to
thf> seriousness of an Issue: which has
made their; life of ministering a solemn
duty to soothe the stings of evil" ln decent
homes. They spoke of Ingleside as they
know It in its results. In the crime and
disgrace which it has bred. They told of
vast Bums of money which, have been
stolen by dupes to feed the vultures of
the track. They called attention to the

PROPOSED ARMY REFORMS.
SECRETARY ROOT'S recommendations made
to the House Committee on : Military Affairs
Tuesday are of such a nature that only military
men can rightly appreciate their merit. Neverthe
less, it would not be wise to 'rely wholly upon the
judgment of such men, for there is a conservatism in
the army as well as in other organizations, and men
are often averse to reform for no other reason than
that of the change it would make in the existing or
der of things. There is likely to be much of that
form; of opposition to the recommendations of the
Secretary, for among other changes he proposes to
break up the present system of organizing: the staiT,
which is so potent at Washington. ;
The objections urged by the Secretary against the
existing organization of the staff appear to be well
founded. He is reported as saying:; "Nothing could
be more unpractical than the present permanent ten
ure of the chief of a bureau. The President, as com
mander-in-chief, is responsible for the efficiency .of
the army. In time of "war he is expected by the
country to produce results by its use. He can ddeterr r
niineAvho shall command the armies and can change
generals in command as often as he chooses, but he
is absolutely powerless as to the heads of these great
departments which, organize and assemble and feed
and clothe and transport and arm and equip and care
for the army. Victory or defeat is organized in the
staff departments before a shot is fired. Inefficiency
in them means necessary disaster at the beginning
and the expenditure of countless treasure and the sac
rifice of countless lives. Yet no matter how plainly
inadequate to the task the head of one df these de
partments may be, the President is powerless to make
a change unless the officer commits some distinct and
heinous offense upon which he can be court
martialed and dismissed from the service." ,
The experience which the country had with the
staff during the war with Spain justifies the demand
for a change. It was in that department alone that
any serious blunders were committed in the struggle.
The people have not yet forgotten the badly selected
camps, the inefficient supplies and worthless food
stuffs provided for the troops. Such mistakes, or
worse, could have been made only by. men unfitted for
the offices they held, and, profiting by the lessons of
that experience, the people will be well pleased to
have the President given* power to change the. heads
of departments whenever circumstances show . a
change to be necessary for the efficiency of the army
and the defense of the republic. .' :;
Another important feature of the recommendations
is that in promotions from the line every third pro
motion to the rank: of major, lieutenant colonel .or
colonel shall be by selection, leaving the other two
to be by seniority, as at. present. By that provision
the President will have authority to advance .officers
of conspicuous merit over the heads of less worthy
officers who may happen to be their seniors in. rank.
As the law stands the President has no power what
ever to reward service of conspicuous. brilliancy, and
ardent and able young officers are unable to' advance
by any merit whatever. .'. ; ..
A third recommendation is that permanent staff
appointments be abolished, and that officers from the
line be detailed for staff duty for periods of four
years. In. supporting this recommendation the Sec
retary said: "The advantages of these provisions, I
believe, will be manifold. I think the change will
break up and prevent the tendency .to bureaucratic
government, of which there is always danger, and will
increase the efficiency of both the line and the staff, by
breaking down the division between them, by giving
to each -'a' more intimate and personal knowledge and
appreciation of the .difficulties and the needs of the
other, and by creating a larger body of all-around
men trained in every branch of the service and com
petent for any command, instead of men who have
been trained in one branch only." - ,
Taken as a whole the reforms appear to.be.well
devised! None of them affect the question of an in
crease, of the army, nor they entail any in
crease in army expenditures. They represent results
of the lessons taught by the Spanish war, and it is to
be hopÂ«d the bureaucratic powers at Washington
will not be able to defeat them.

OVERLOOKED
OLD BALANCES
IN CITY FUNDS
Supervisors Singular Omis
sion in Their Financial
Investigation.
Were in Blissful Ignorance of
Surplus to the Credit of the
City Receiving and Insane
Detention Hospitals.
The. unexpected discovery of unexpended
balances in the city Receiving and Insane
Detention Hospitals, amounting to some
$SOOO, has caused considerable comment in
the City Hall regarding the methods em
ployed by the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee, consisting of Jennings, Hotallng
and Tobin, in adjusting the financial .'dif
ficulties of the city. Xt is argued that if
these balances have been overlooked by
the committee there are others that may
be uncovered by a little proper investiga
tion, which might preclude the possibility
of shutting off street lights. The omis
sion seems to demonstrate- that the city
fathers are but novices in the art of
finance. . '' : ' . 'â¢.Â¦.'.
The Finance Committee has been mak
ing an exhaustive inquiry Into the various
municipal funds for the past- three weeks,
and yet during all that time the members
have been in blissful ignorance of the fact
that $SOOO available for two branches of
the Health Department was left over frcm
two specific appropriations by tne rtÂ»-1
board. This fjrnorance Is peculiar from' the
fact that when the financial inquiry was
first commenced Expert Williams was di
rected to place in the hands of each Su
pervisor a copy, of the statement of the
city's financial condition, which- he had
previously prepared.. Â¦â¢-Â¦Â¦â¢. =.
Under the head of "surplus in funds Dc.
cember 31, 1590,'.' the Supervisors would
have found, if. they had taken the trouble
to look, the following figures, among other
data:: : ; \ Â¦ .
THE PORTO RICAN TARIFF.
AGAIN we return to our advice that there be
little or no legislation as to our Spanish
islands until the whoie situation and subject
are better understood. The attempt already made to
settle commercial and revenue questions in the case
of Porto Rico should admonish Republican leaders of
the soundness of this advice. . ;
In defending the Porto Rico tariff Dolliver, the
Republican spokesman, was driven to confess that it
was a temporary measure. He disclosed, wittingly
or otherwise, the vast complications that lie ahead of
the country', and, though his oratory was punctuated
with patriotic appeals and Bible quotations, the hard
facts projected* through it like the points in a rock
rising above the moss. - . â¢* ,
The facts are that tropical production of tobacco,
sugar and rice, stimulated by a vertical sun and the
fruit of cheap labor, reaches the final market at a far
less cost than that of similar production by our do
mestic labor, at American wages and under a tem
perate zone sunshine. . .
Under the existing military government of Porto
Rico all food staples and other merchandise and tools
and machinery required in the agriculture and horti
culture of the island are admitted free, as are school
supplies, wearing apparel and medicines. All this free
merchandise enters into the cost of production, to
cheapen it, and adds its weight to still further reduce
the labor cost of what enters into competition with
our home labor, wages and production.
The League of Domestic Producers, which resists
and resents free trade for Porto Ricari products, has
proved by incontrovertible statistics that Porto Rican
?ugar and tobacco can* pa y the full duties exacted by
the Dineley bill and still yield to the planters a
larger profit, than is possible to our domestic pro
ducers. ' . . Â¦."Â¦'. â¢ . . . - .
We do not propose any finely drawn constitutional
construction to extricate anybody from the im
measurable bog and swamp of difficulties into which
expansion has led the country- Those who are re
sponsible for it must take the consequences which will
finally follow. But we warned the country in advance
of these difficulties, and we now stand, as we did then,
for the protection of American wages and the Ameri
can standard of life, against the tropical standard and
wages. Le* those who are responsible for the situa
tion find constitutional arguments; we have presented
them long ago.
There is an existing crisis in American agriculture
that involves far more serious consequences than can
fall upon Porto Rico. We affirm the wisdom of, the
declaration of the League of Domestic Producer?,
that: "There is no pressing reason for Congress to
legislate for Porto Rico." Things should have been
left in statu quo, lest worse divisions result than. the
recent one which has called for application of all
means of party discipline and has compelled a com
promise, despite all efforts of the caucus.
Eloquence and oratory are fine things in their
place, and Â«o is the flag; but fine things out of place
are no longer fine. The flag seems to be in that con
dition, and has been "nailed" to ?p many places that
much soberness of mind and much time for study
must determine what is to be done about it.

FOURTH CONCERT
OF THE SEASON
THE Rymphpny concert- at the Grand
Opera-house yesterday afternoon was
the last but -one- of the series.. : The
Â¦ .. programme â¢ woiÂ« interesting j without
being eruditel It comprised Mendelssohn's.
"Fingal'sCave," a master's masterpiece;
the much-commended- Second Symphony
of Schumann; Saint-Saens' diabolical
"Danse Macabre," that stunning bit . of
musical tomfoolery.^ and Weber's gener
ously melodic "Oberon" overture. ' ..."
Passing over the. question of admls
sibillty in the case of the "Danse Maca
bre " which found warranty, no doubt, in
the fact that it received the first encore
of the season, the serious and trivial ele
ments of the programme were well bal
anced â on the Â¦ one hand the sensational
"Danse" and the cheap Weber overture,
and on the other the rigorous Schumann
epic with Mendelssohn's sound but not
severe "Hisperla'V to tone the whole. It
would have been a better arrangement if
this composition had been given at the
end of the concert instead of at the be
ginning. ,- '
The orchestra was as capable as usual,
and Mr. Holmes more satisfying. He was
out of touch with the weird and mystical
"Danse Macabre." but the composition
plays itself. In the Weber number he had
a task well within his powers, and the
admirable work of the orchestra resulted
in a' very Â¦ commendable interpretation.
The symphony also lent itself to his schol
arly temperament, and but for his cus
tomary want of a true feeling for rhythm
and his Inability to endow his readings
with poetic individuality, it was treated
with a very acceptable truth and sin
cerity. '
This very German work is marked by
an undercurrent of somberness that per
vades every movement, even the some
what irrelevant scherzo. ' It is essentially.
Schumannesqueâ recondite, yet suggestive,
deeply poetic, bafflingly beautiful. There
is, strangely enough, more light in the
adagio, with its noble melody, than in the
scherzo or the three allegro divisions, and
it was this movement that -Â¦Â¦ was most
pleasantly given. PORTER GARNETT.

lishes free trade between Manila and Sail Francisco,
as it undoubtedly does between Virginia and Mary
land, then the fact that we have got into a new com
petition is only the least trouble before us. "We are;
in that case disarmed at once in the momentous de
mand which this nation has made for equal rights in
the commerce of Asia. Can we stand before the
Cabinets of Europe protesting against the occupation
of the ports of China. to the prejudice of American
trade when we ourselves, from our headquarters on
the border, being carried away by our own constitu
tion, have deliberately drawn a dead line about- the
Philippines for the permanent exclusion of everybody
else?" ... '-..' , ,- . ..â¢ " ; : '- Â¦Â¦ : -
We should say that this suggests a remarkable re
sult of having become "a world power." If it mean
anything when translated out of . its Dolliveresque
verbiage it means that in deference to the Cabinets of
Europe we are. to make the Philippines free to all
trade except our own. Between them and us there is
to be a tariff wall. Between them and our commer
cial rivals there is to be free trade, because we have
"demanded" an open door in China. Now, while The
Call is willing to assent to any plan that will keep
Asiatic competition- off the backs of American wage^
earners, we may be pardoned for being amused at the
fix the expansionists are in as a result of going con
trary to our advice and what we believe to be proper
American policy. : :
Mr. Dolliver himself perspires under the load, for
later on in his oration he said: "O my countrymen,
we are in the midst of such difficult responsibilities
that I sometimes feel that our resolutions and our pur-,
poses are â¢overwhelmed.- There are two ideas of the
national duty in this emergency. One is that the
nation should take care of itself, and let the world
alone. That is a narrow view. The other ideal of
national life, an ideal born in the heart of the Work
man of Nazareth, is that no nation liveth to itself
alone, but that every real nation pours itself out in
.the service of mankind/ .- â¢
Now. without being gaudy, that is neat. .We have
been' warning these gentlemen for two. j'ears.of the
trouble to come, and they now. find such difficult re
sponsibility ahead that they fly to the consolations of
religion! Pray whathighef duty-is charged upon this
nation than to take care of itself? Â¦-..*Â¦â¢
Our Federal constitution in its preamble -says:
"We thepcopleof the United States, in order to form
a more perfect union,- establish justice, insure *do
me.stic tranquillity, provide for the common defense,'
promote the general welfare and- secure the blessing*
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain
and establish this constitution of the United' States of
America." * â¢
. That looks as though the constitution intends that
the nation shall take care of .itself. But the impis
sioned one from lowa substitutes that for something
he has discovered in "the heart of the Workman of
Nazareth," which certainly appears nowhere in the
THE INGLESIDE GAMBLERS AGAIN
rKQM the tone of the proceedings at the meet
ing uf the Police Committee yesterday it is evi
dent the committee intend to report to the
tJoard of Supervisors a resolution closing the down
own pooirooms and reopening Ingleside racetrack
or unlimited gambiing. The resolutions state, in
ieed, that the racing shall be permitted to any one
'crson or corporation for forty days only in a year
jut it will be easy for the unscrupulous and cunning
uana^ers of the gambling game to organize a dozen
icing associations and pass the lease of the track
jn from one to the other every forty days, and thus
ominuc the gambling privilege as long as they
Against the proposed resolution there appeared
fcrme 01 the foremost pastors of the city. They at
tended the meeting not as representatives of religious
ticci^ but as men having close relations with the
homes of the people and understanding fully the
moral sentiment of the community. It is to the pastors
that people go in their sorrows and distress, and it is
therefore the pastors who know more thoroughly
than any one else how much of grief and shame and
wretchedness the track gambling at lhgleside has
bi ought upon the homes of the city. The protest of
the pastors was therefore the protest of thousands of
earnest men and women, and yet the members of the
Police Committee paid less attention to it than to the
pitas of the gamblers for the privilege to prey upon
the vices of the community and entice not men only
but boys and women on the road to ruin..- â¢; Â¦'-â¢/.
The resolutions submitted to the committee are ab
surdly inconsistent. If gambling is to be licensed,
why is there any distinction made between one chss
of gamblers and another? Why suppress the pool
rooms downtown and open a gambling resort at
Ing!e>ide? Why shut out California proprietors of
poolrooms and confer exclusive favors on the gang
<Â¦} trsck gamblers who have come from the East to
enrich themselves at the expense of San Francisco'
When it was argued that the track gamblers have
I&rge investments at Ingleside and are entitled to an
ii'cone from thei; money, one of the pastors asked,
" WouJd you gi^nt to a man who invested in burglars'
tools the privilege of plying the trade of burglary long
enough every year to get a return on the investment?"
To the question there was no answer.
It was urged. by., Tobin that by licensing track gam
blinp for forty: day* at $100 a day the city would de
rive a revenue of $4000 a year. That statement, is
mathema.ticaJly correct, but track gambling led A. C.
Widber.when City Treasurer, to rob the city of $116,
000 to "play the races." It would be well to have the
city recover some of that mon^y from the gamblers,
J>ut according to Tobin's plan of getting it back by in-
of .S4OOO a year, it will take twenty-nine
years to. recover the money the city lost on track
gambling in that one instance. .
Furthermore, through the defalcations of Norton
;md Welburn the Federal Government lost $70,000 on
the races. It might be well for the rate of license to
be raised in order that some of that money be re
covered Thrre remains, however, the consideration
that while we are licensing gambling for the purpose
of recovering what it cost us in times past, the re
newal of the gambling would lead to other defalca
tions and embezzlements. Before the forty days are
over there might be $46,000 gone and another suicide
added to the record. - ' â¢ V*
The gamblers are boasting they have a sufficient
number of the Supervisors pledged to the resolutions
to assure their passage and the consequent reopening
of liiÃlcside. That boast The Call believes to be in
i'ile one. It is not likely a majority of the Super
visors will defiantly outrage pnblic sentiment for the
sake of conceding a gambling privilege to such a gang
.is is back of this movement. Should it be so< how
ever, there will still be an insuperable obstacle in the
way of the gamblersâ the Mayor's veto. Again and
:>Ez\n has Mayor Phelan declared his opposition .to
gambling and to the corruptions which result from it.
He ennnot consent to surrender now to .the gamblers
without a .total loss of self-respect. Nor can the
ramblers find strength enough among the Super
\isors to pass the resolutions over the veto..
Thus, despite the contemptuous tone with which
the Police Committee treated the protests of morality.
there is ample reason for believing that in the end the
victory will be with the better element of the people.
In the meantime, however, the fight should be kept
up. When the issue comes before the'Superyisors on
Monday there should be a strong representation of
il*r people to reutter, their protests against the wrong.
The gamblers were beaten once, and their nefarious
trade at Ing'e^ide was broken tip. They can be
1 cntcn again if the people are resolute in opposing
this new attempt to' license an abomination which has
led so many deluded men and women to every form
of vice and crime, from theft to suicide.

THE SA-N^iTRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 2, 1900. *
HEROIC CRONJE'S SURRENDER.
The Boer General Warmly Praised by California Editors for
His Magnificent Fight Against an Over
, whelming Force. .
General Cronje has at last surrendered, but It Is a surrender that carries Honor
with it. History will carry the name of General Cronje down to coming ages as
one of the most heroic generals the world has ever known. Even his captors, the
British, are unstinted in their praise of the gallant defense of the Boer gen
eral, who, with an army of 4000 men. held at bay a British army of 43.000 sol
diers equipped with all the modern weapons of warfare, their artillery being es
pecially death-dealing In its construction ond operation.
Â¦ ... Â¦ .Â¦ Fresno Democrat. â¢ .-. .' \ ' .:â¢'â¢ 'â¢Â¦. ; Â¦
â¢-'â¢ The surrender of General Cronje was not unexpected by those familiar with
the situation, and It came as a welcome surprise to the men of all nationalities
who were eager ta seer the brave little band rescued from a fate worse than
death. Cronje's men had done all that was required of them and their heroism
is on a par with the self-devotion. of those who stood with Leonidaa at Ther
mopylae. Â¦'.-Â¦Â¦'-." , Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦ 'â¢Â¦ " ' ."
Whether Cronje'?- disaster will be regarded as a deliberate sacrifice, willingly
made, to save the main Boer army from dispersion and destruction, or as a
noble and desperate effort to delay the evil results of a fatal strategical blunder,
it will go down as. a Crowning* act of military martyrdom and a remarkable ex
ample of the patriotism of a brave and warlike people. .. :â¢:>Â»:â¢

Â¦ â¢ In the surrender of Cronje only the expected has happened.: It has been appar
ent from the outset.that while the Boers might be brave and might fight ever so
determinedly it was only sf question of time before they would be literally over
whelmed by numbers. That la what has happened to Cronje's army and it is
doubtless what will in time happen to the rest of the Boer forces. However,
even though finally defeated, the Boers will have the credit of having made thÂ©
pluckiest kind of a fight and of having caused John Bull one of the most unpleas
ant half hours In all his history. Â¦ 'â¢Â¦.:...'Â¦â¢. ' _ â¢â¢ .".'.Â¦ -'.Â¦.Â¦â¢'Â¦â¢"-'â¢. "-. : '.'"-

Cronje arid his men are heroes. The story of their courage will .lire !n his
tory and be sung In the ages to come. For ten days of the most terrific bom
bardment they, stood off many times their number, of as good soldiers as ever car
ried gun s^ They held out to give time fpr the rallying of their country's troops
at other points. Gloriously did they stop the advance of the British troops and
their arms were not laid down until surrender had become the only alternative
for annihilation. They are now prisoners of war, but their deeds of valor hayÂ©
been written upon the scrolls of fame. 'â¢â¢ No wonder the London Journals speak
highly of them. It would not be creditable for them to do otherwise . .

When it Is. revealed that this handful of men were sacrificing themselves for a
purpose, that while they opposed with bra\-e front and brought to a full stop the
invasion of their territory, 30.000 of their countrymen were rushing to the bor
ders'of the Transvaal arid building a second line of defense to bar the further
advance of the British, then the record of those ten days becomes doubly a heroic

WOMEN OF

AGAIN MEET
Tragic v Death of Bessie
Evans to Be Further
Discussed. -
Openly Suggested That Louis Kutner
Be Forcibly Presented With
a Coat of Tar and ,
Feathers.
Special Dispatch. to The Call. :
FRESNO. March I.â The women of Ma
dera will hold a mass meeting. to-morrow
afternoon to consider further the suicide
of Bessie Evans, the Yosemite Hotel wait
ress who killed herself by taking carbolic
acid. The object of the gathering will be
to decide what further action If any to
take in the matter. The meeting will un
doubtedly be attended by nearly, all the
prominent women of the place. Among
those who are taking an active interest
in the movement, are Mrs. J. F. Daulton,
wife of the Supervisor;. Mrs. Return Rob
erts, wife of the bank president; Mrs. G.
G. Parsons,. Mrs. E. M. McCardle, Mrs.
J. E. Newman, Mrs. R.- P. Mace, Mrs. Dr.
Butin, Miss Fleming and numerous others.
Public sentiment has not abated In the
least. Some of the most radically in
clined talk openly of- "tar and feathers"
and other extreme action, but it is not
likely that any public meeting will in
dorse this policy. : . '-.--,
To-morrow morning the first issue of the
Weekly Times since public indignation
was aroused by the last will appear. It
Is feared that if : the paper assumes a
fighting attitude and antagonizes further
the sentiment of the community trouble
may result. .
The friends of Louis Kutner say that
young man will return to Madera and re
sume his business as soon as- his engage
ment in San Francisco is at an end...

Members of Northwest Mounted Po
lice Seek Enlistment in the.
Strathcona Horse.
Special Dispatch to The Call. . ...f<\ ;
VICTORIA. B. C, March I.â The steam
er Amur, which arrived this morning,
brought a number of members of; the
Northwest Territory mounted police/ who
are down to seek enlistment in the Strath
cona Horse. Among them are Captain
Jarvis, who built and has been in charge
of the post on the Dalton trail since its
construction two years ago, and Corporals
Snell and Sklrving, who were in charge of
the adventurous party which went fiom
Dawson to search for the lost Moffatt
party and cleared up the mystery by find
ing the graves of the lost men. There are
three other members of the police on the
way out from Dawson to the coast, also
coming to seek places in the corps of
horse. They and Corporals Snell and
Skirvlng,. who caught the Amur, started
from Dawson on February 10. One of the
best mushing records ever made between
Bennett and Dawson is credited to the
two members of the police. They covered
the distance, measuring overy foot with
their moccasins, in thirteen' days. -.."â¢
Captain Jarvis brings news of -a rich
new gold strike In the Porcupine dlstnct
The strike is on Boulder Creek. Fifty
cents to the pan, it is said, has been taken
out. The creek has been staked the whole
length on both sides. .
Captain Jarvis says: VI cannot -vouch
for the news of I the strike from personal'
knowledge, but I got it from several per
sons-on my way out 'from the poÃf to
Haines Mission, and several-" impartial
.witnesses are usually held to be sufficient
to : establish a report." : Â¦
Â¦i It seems that Boulder Creek has been
known for a long time to carry some pros
pects of gold; but that the richness was
not learned until- within the last week.
Jake Blgelow, I understand, is the discov
erer. - . -'...". : -. Â¦ . â¢.Â¦-. â¢ .
It seems, he made the rich find' by sink

CHICO. March I.â Sheriff Wilson; to-day
arrested two young Indians named John
Richards and Steve Thompson on sus
picion of the murder of Billy Simpson'
near the residence of General Bid well
Tuesday night. After a series of ques
tions Richards made the following con
fession: . ?'.'-.':
"My name Is John Richards; I am 18
years old. Steve Thompson had often
been after me during the past- two or
three weeks to kill and rob Billy Simp
son, but I have kept putting him off.
"Tuesday night he met me -on the cor
ner, where the Salvation Army was sing
ing, and asked me again and I agreed to
help do the job. We went back of Mc-
Feely's shop and got a heavy piece of
gaspipe. about four feet long, and walked
across First street to a place near the
nursery house and waited for Billy Simp
son. We saw him coming under the elec
tric light; when he came along we walked
with him across the creek. When we got
back of the mansion I walked ahead, Billy
in the center and Steve behind. Steve
knocked Billy down with the piece of gas
pipe, and after he fell Steve hit him twice
more. Billy never spoke after he was hit
the first time. We then carried him under
a tree and took his money and keys, out
of his pocket."
Thompson this afternoon went with of
ficers to the bank of Chico Creek, about
two hundred yards below the mansion
and showed them where he had buried'
his part of the stolen money. He admits
having delivered the first blow, but says
that it was Richards who struck the
blows after Simpson had fallen and says
that it was Richards who went throuch
the dead man's pockets.
Sheriff Wilson has sworn to complaints
charÃing both Thompson and Richards
with murder. ; v Â»;

REDDING, March I.â The last of the
four men taken from beneath the debris' of
the immense cave-in at Iron Mountain' has
died. ' Externally none of . the rescued

There : are' still Â¦ three men in the mine
and no hope Is how held forth of their be

hours, death from suffocation is probably
their fate,*' even if uninjured. . The three
men who 'are' still 'in the mine are' J* Mc-

Three â¢ of ' the Â¦ ...rescued men were

Two-hour shifts. of rescuers are working
day and night, but as every inch of the
way must be. heavily retimbered: progress
is agonizingly slow. . The .scenes at the
mouth of the tunnel, whence the
main work of rescue is carried on, are.dev
oid of. the' heart-rending features, â¢ such
as coalmine horrors know, owing to thÂ«
absence of women and children. Fellow
miners are standing around ready to take
a turnat the rescue work, but except. for
'the unusual silence no one would know
but that ' the men : were.' simply changing
shifts. News is hourly expected that thÂ»Â»
dangerous â¢ ground has been cut through

alive. 'Â¦Â¦..'. â¢ Â¦ â¢
A second cave-in In the copper level this
morning injured four rescuers. They were
brought to the 'surface and were able to
walk to the hospital. Dr. J. M. Read
came â¢ back to town from the mine this
morning, reporting that his services were
no longer necessary, as he believed all tho
Imprisoned men were dead. The work of
rescue is, however, proceeding witn all
possible expedition. Â¦ .
posed have been quarantined. Division
Superintendent J. B. Wright of the South

CAUSE MUCH DAMAGE
Entire Warrnamoo District ir Aus
tralia Devastated and Seven
Lives Lost..
VANCOUVER, March 1.-The steamer.
Â¦ Aorangl, from Sydney, to-day brings an
account of. the most disastrous -bush fires
in Victoria experienced in the last fifty
years. The entire Warrnamboo : district
has been .devastated and the damage is
estimated at $2,000,000. The fire broke out
simultaneously; in various parts of the
colony, and burned for. two days and
three nights, finally burning itself out on
the morning of January 31. The whole
country between Dunkeld and Mortlake Is
a mass of blackness. Seven persons per
ished in the flames, which swept over a
tract forty miles long and thirty miles
wide, consuming 1,000,000 acres of grass
six wool warehouses, 2000 sheep. 1000 cattle
and horses. :â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢
VERY CLINGING GOWNS.
NEW YORK, March I.â The â¢ < Sapho"
hearing was to-day resumed by Magis
trate Mott in his private room in the
Center-street court. William Inglis, a re
porter, described the second scene in the
first act. He identified as correct the pho
tographs shown him of the scene, one be
ing that of Fannie being carried upstairs
by Jean. Inglis said that as Sapho was
being carried upstairs she was utterinc
inarticulate sounds which seemed to de
note intense satisfaction. He told about
the ballroom scene and the contest be
tween Toto. a minor character, and
Sapho for the possession of Jean's favor
Inglis spoke of Fannie Le Grand's gown
as: "a very clinging costume." "She has
to take very tiny steps as she wears it"
he continued, "and -it clings to her very
lightly and reveals her anatomy very
plainly." Court adjourned until to-mor

Cavalry who were escorting a provision
train. The Americans scattered and while
returning to camp o- man was killed.
The insurgents captured four- horses and
a quantity of provisions. A subsequent
recomioissance of the locality developed"
the fact that there were intrenchments
there and a force of Filipinos estimated to
number 800 men. "T-'.V
The â¢ T4.;T 4 .; r d cavalry is preparing to
drive the insurgents out.
The recently purchased naval transport
Alava. sent to Ragay, In the Gulf of Li
berate, for Spanish prisoners, has return
ed here bringing &X) persons, including
priests, officers, soldiers and civilians, and
ten Amc-icans.
The navy officials, being informed that
the prisoners were carelessly guarded,
hurried the Alava to Ragay, manned by
twenty bluejackets. Six officers from the
Brooklyn and fifty marines accompanied
the transport.
WASHINGTON. March I.â Three cable
messages from General Otis were received
at the War Department to-day. One
contained a long list of casualties among
the troops In the Philippines Fince the
last report. A second announced the ar
rival at Manila to-day of a Government
transport from the rast coast of Tayabas
Province with eight American and 410
Spanish soldiers recently released from
captivity among the insurgents. The third
message states that since the recent open
ing to commerce of the island ports 13,000
tons of hemp and 70,000 bales of tobacco
had been received at Manila, and that
large shipments .of the commodities
named will soon be made to the United
States and other countries. The fact that
General Otis has not reported any mili
tary operations since the departure of
General Bates' expedition to Southern
Luzon to complete the plan of opening the
hemp ports in that quarter Is accepted by
the War Department officials as an indi
cation that the campaign is progressing
satisfactorily, .md that our. : forces have
not met with any serious opposition by
the insurgents in recent movements.
Root Is Confident.
Secretary Root has made a positive de
nial of the published report that he is wor
ried at the long silence of General Otis in
regard to military operations In the Phil
ippines and had cabled him to make an
immediate report of the situation. The
Secretary said that, on the contrary, he
was satisfied with the situation. The
officials are confident that the backbone
of the insurrection is: broken and that
there will be no further hostilities on a
large scale and that affairs in the archi
pelago will be in fairly good shape by the
time of the arrival of the Philippine Civil
Commission about the middle of May for
the proposed transfer of governmental
control from the military to the civil au^
thorities. ...-....- , -. . -
General Otis is expected to return to the
Vnited States on leave of absence soon
after the arrival of the Philippine Com
mission. It Is desirable that he should
meet the commission and give it the bene
fit of his knowledge of affairs in the Phil
ippines. ;-. . Â¦ Â¦ .â¢ .
General Mac Arthur will assume tempor
ary command of the military forces of
the islands when General Otis leaves.
Casualties Reported.
General Otis has transmitted to the War
Department the following list of killed
and wounded in recent operations in the
Philippines:

Chicago Grain Market
. CHICAGO, March 1.-^A . splurge of : activity,
due to the reDort from. New York that- fortjx
six boatloads of '-wheat- had been : taken for
export, was the only incident to break the;
monotony of trading In. the wheat pit.'.to-day;
It' was a day. : EeneTally speaking, of. covering
shorts, with thÂ«- undertone steady because of
the steadiness of Liverpool . In' the .face of the
slump here yesterday. The abrupt curtailment
of. the Liverpool session ' was .somewhat of a
damper. on the activity In the local pit. -The
fight was waged around 65c for May. This op
tion opened a shade ' over .. yesterday at 65V*C;'
touched Cs%c and then sold oft to 64% c. ' At 6T>c
some wheat came out on stop-loss or<lern. ' On
covering by shorts . the market Hteodled â¢â¢ and
.fluctuated narrowly until' near the. end. '.The
report t-at fortj>six loads had been taken for
export advanced May to 65V&C before further'
reports less bullish concerning the foreign .sales
arrived. The market then reacted to 65VÂ£q and
shortly afterward closed firm, .May Vie over:
yesterday at- 65ySC5%c. .'Â¦ . Â¦ . â¢
. In the corn market the. selling pressure and
the demand were arrayed against each other,
apparently to see which could be the more In
different. The result wns.a slow and heavy'
market. May closed ;%c down at 34%'534'54c. â¢'Â¦'?
... The oat market was firm, trade quiets- May
closed a shade improved from yesterday at 23^
(&23\ic. -? - Â¦ : .'- ,-.: - . ;-. Â¦ . ' , Â¦'
- Provisions opened steady because hog receipts
were under the estimate, but turned weak on
commission house liquidation. Later In the
day the general demand improved, packers buy
ing, and the market rallied sharply. On the
bulge there was the usual profit taking, which
took off the edge of the advance, but the close ,
was steady.. May pork closed unchanged. May

Patriotic songs were heard everywhere -Instead
of stock quotations, and dealings were infinitely
small. Principal centers were ' slmllatly- ' en?

were blocked by messages of consratulatlon.

RTJPY LANTERN,- V
venient a 'Â¦'perfectly : ; dark room may be
used: and the light obtained from a ruby
Janternâ that is, a lantern made for pho
tographic Â¦ purposes and giving only red
light through red \ or ruby glass. (The.
darkroom :-.- will/, be treated separately.)
New; that '.we have : our. light safe we can
open the box : of plates without any fear
of ruining thenx; The next, move . Is to
load the holder. There are many styles
of hblders On the market,; but as a usual
thing .the holders are arranged to hold
two plates; .They are what we might; call
a thla i box, in which the platea are placed.
They are . from one-half/ to one Inch In
thickness and whatever width and length
your camera is capable of making In a pic
ture:' There; are" two "slides'* .that fit Into
tlte holder^ : When Tve start in to load wÂ«j
will draw the slides and take a. plate from
the box. arid lay in the bolder, in narrow
grobyes that: run round .'the edge of the
holdef. for. that /purpose, -.with 'the film
side of the plate "out,"- or. toward, the
"slide." ':: After '.the.', plate is In the groove*
we theÂ« replace the "slides." ; It will ;be
noticed that side of the slide is black.
When loading the slides the black side
should >Â©Â¦; placed- next to the plate. -~ When
we have : mide an . exposure . we return the
slide ;wlth ; this black side out to denote
that the ; plate it covers has been ex
posed and proceed, to load the other side
of the Holder: ;in the . same : raanner. ; To
tell which is the .film side of -a plate we
should hold It so that we can get a re
flection on the plate; from oar light; It
will be noticed that one side of the plate
shows a strong reflection. 'The other side
has a dull appearance, somewhat resemb
ling ground glass. This is the film side.
Before placing the plate In the holder we
should : dust the .film .with a: soft camel
hair brush, about two Inches wide, The
reason we dp this is to remove any dust
that may be on the plate, and by this
means we avoid "dust spots" In our nega
tive This dusting of the film must be
done in a very careful way. .Only- dust
one way. Do not go from one end of the
plate to the other and then back to the
other end. If you do this you will take
the dust off one .way and bring it back
on the otjier way. The proper way to do
is to take the plate In: the left hand, hold
in c it so that the thumb, is on one edge
and the middle finger on the other edge,
with the film side of the plate up. Take
the brush In the right, hand and dust
fcom the top of the plate down " to the
bottom. - Then go back, to the top and
come down again, and so on, going very
slowly. â¢ If we dust fast .we will electrify
the filmland every particle of dust flying
about In the air will settle on the plate.
Be careful not;to touch, the film with the
HOLDING THE 'Â¦ PLATE.
fingers, or it. will 'leave; grease stains.' It
is just as Importantr too. that we-'da-not.
touch 'the back of the 'plate' with the fin
gers, for It may be "that some tlme^ we
v/lll : hkye . the film of one -plate come In
contact with the back Ot the plate that
the, fingers have been oh. This- will also
give grease stains,. .for, the film. of. the
plate, will take up -the "stains from the
back of the- plate, and. perhaps .spoil , an
otherwise good negative. However. It is
always better to. pack the -plates after
exposure and before 'development -Just as
they are turned out'by the manufacturer,
face to face. Do not make the very com
mon and natural mistake of removing the
black paper from around the . plates be
fore '.they- are all uped. Thla* paper Is
around the plates for two., pur
posesâto-protect them- from ; any -light'
â¢ that -may Â¦â¢ creep "Jn" to" them :around -the
edges of the box and also, to protect them
from the box itself. There is more or less
hyposulphite of soda In the cardboard of
which' the box is., made/ and as will be
shown later on this'chemical Is very ruin

PITTSBURG, March I.â Charles L:
Davis (Alvin . Joslyn), the well-known
character actor, and owner of the Alvin
Theater of this city, died to-night, aged
52 years. He had been sick for several
weeks with peritonitis and paralysis of
the throat and died after much suffering.
Mr. Davis came of theatrical parents
and was born while his parents were .on
the road. He went on the â¢ stage at the
age of five years and was in the show
business continuously 'from that .time
until 1839, when he retired and built . the
Alvin T.heater at a cost of $225.000. ":* At
the time of its building, the AHin was
considered the finest theatrical house in
America, but It was too much of . a
burden and In its second season the Fort
Pitt Bank, which held much of Mr. Davis'
paper, took charge of the house with the
understanding that when . the $170,000 in
debtedness was cleared Its-- 'owner- should
resume charge. The claims had all been
met with the exception of about $20,000 at
the beginning of the present -season and
Mr. Davis expected to be sole owner next
season. .Â¦. Â¦ ' - ' Â¦.-Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢ ,- -
. Mr. Davis was known throughout the
entire country as Alvln Joslyn, the New

BY GEORGE W. GILSON.
That which .we find most advantageous
to a beginner is a plate that will require
at least two or three seconds exposure on
a landscape in good strong light. After
we have worn oft the "scare" which we
feel at first it will be ample ! time to take
up the more rapid brands of plate. The
plates come one dozen in a^box. : When wre
open them we .find they are packed face to
face. That is, the film sides are facing.
They are or a creamy. white and should
only be opened by a ruby light In a room
that is otherwise perfectly dark; See that
. no; light enters the room from cracks
: around, the. doors, or windows!, >' All white
light ' should be completely shut off. ; In
i making your- ruby.l ight :you can use an
; ordinary, window, shutting, off all the light
i except one. pane of glass. â¢â¢ Over this place
; one sheet of what is known . as "postof
.nce" paper. : It-can be obtained from al
; most any postofflce or' -stockhpu'se and Is.
of a deep yellow-color;.'- Over this, paper
place one' sheet of "raby" paper, Â¦ which
can 'be. obtained.', from any-stock house.;
You will find that in most cases th's light
will be perfectly safe, but it should be
tested before using. To test It take ontr
of thevplates from, the box. in total dark
; ness, and wrap ..'a sheet â¢of . perfectly.:
i opaque paper around half of It. (The
! black, paper which comes .^around the
plates In each box will answer the 'pur
pose admirably.) .Now expose, the other
I half of the plate to the light, about one
foot distant from it, for,about:nve:;min
; utes, after which develop (we , will speak
' of developing later on) It in' total dark
ness, 'if there Is no change In the. end of
the plate that was exposed to the Ijght we
may feel sure the light is safe. If, how
ever,- It is found that half . of the Â¦ plate
has developed darker than the end /that
was covered by the paper it Indicates that
the light is too strong...-To remedy It' we
should add one more thickness of the'post

INSPECTOR EXONERATES
TRANSPORT OFFICERS
Understood His Report Finds Them
.'â¢Â¦Â¦/:' .. Blameless for Condition of
/. ;;â¢ -Â¦: '' . . Manauense.
The report of the 'Inspector on ; the
charges against the Manauense is now
in the hands of General- Shafter, and it
is -understood that It exonerates the
transport officers, both on board the ves
sel and in charge of the home office here.
This, coupled with the Investigation be
fore the British Consul, makes it seem as
If It would go hard with the engineer. -
The evidence given before the Consul
was decidedly against the engineer, and
although no decision has been rendered
upon his case, the exoneration of the
transport officers will probably have, some
effect, particularly as the evidence given
before the Consul was but a repetition of
what was given to the inspector for the
army. In fact, a good deal of the testi
mony taken by . the inspector, copies of
which had been retained by the owners,
served as a basis for the charges pre
ferred against McDonald, and for the
cross-examination of the witnesses for
and against him.- . : Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦.-â¢'.. . :

Â¦; J iv.â choice of srrjBJECT; â¢.-;Â¦"â¢;
The selection of a subject is most im
portant and to get a pleasing picture there
are certain principles which should be re
membered so that when, a view is being
selected the finished photograph will maka
a picture worth looking at, a pleasure to
him who looks at It and a source of grati
fication to the maker. V, .. : . . -. :
Briefly, the points for consideration may
be said to consist of balance; contrast,
clouds, lighting and foreground. . â¢ â¢
The first named Is the Inclusion of more
or 4es3 prominent objects to the sides of,
the picture, so that one may have the ef
fect of balancing the other. These should
not be of equal size: the artistic effect
will be more - pronounced if unequal; a
bush,- clumps of rushes or a broken
branch will often be all that Is required
to correct the lopsided look that we too
frequently see in landscape pictures. Sec
ondly,-a picture without con*"-ast always
looks flat and uninteresting, it should bd
the aim of -the artist to make this con
trast gradual, never sudden or abrupt ths
bright lights merging into the shadows
without harsh or decided lines, and both
lights and shades so disposed as to pre
serve, the necessary balance. A bright
whitetobject on one side of the picture
will throw the picture out unless Mma
similar light object can -be- included on
the other side. On --this subject it may
be noted that the contrast given by under";
exposureâor the want of it/the result of
overexposureâ ls not art. What is to be
admired is the soft print, with plenty of
contrast, but with the softness of nature
retained. ...,:.:Â¦Â¦ Â¦:Â¦ -,\.. Â¦:Â¦ :..;...â¢
Clouds may be designated nature's back
ground, and to obtain an effective picture
a proper background is as necessary as a
suitable foreground. Nothing gives a pic
ture such a finished . appearance as a good
cloud effect; it is not always that clouds
can be obtained on the same negative as
the picture itself, but when possible the
effect is always the best \ :.: .-> -.-;â¢- .-, Â¦ -
Methods of obtaining sky and cloud pic
tures will be treated of later on. The *Ã¼b-:
ject of lighting is of the utmost Import
ance,and Is probably the most difficult to
deal with, and for this reason deserve* nil
the more study: "We are aware that a view
will look entirely different at various pe
riods of the day. When the sun is low
in the horizon It throws long, heavy shad
ows both, morning and evening, and when
in the zenith It gives scarcely any shadow
at all except underneath. Then. too. from
the position we take up the sun may fall
on :the object, showing all detail distinct
ly, or It may be behind the object, throw
ing the side next to us Into comparative
darkness. AH these give different effects
to the scene, and we should Btud7 tho
view under the varying conditions so as
to select that lighting which will give the
bast result for the object we have set be
fore us. When the sun. is full on the scene
and nearly vertical the resulting picture
will be generally flat and wanting In con
trast: pood effects, with 'plenty of llpht
and shade, can be had with the sun more
or less to one side of the view: and at
times, with the light slightly behind the
chosen portion, a very pleading effect may
be secured. However, no hard and fast
rule can be laid down, the particular light
that will suit one scene will not suit an
other, "consequently the choice must - be
left to the : individual* whose object in
every case should be the securing of a pic-,
ture conveying in an artistic manner th<
impression Â¦; created In -him by tbe-wyw,
and the better he Is able to show In hlsr
work that Impression the more claims will"
he have to be an artist. .... ':"- ... â¢..â¢

important factor, as without something. tn ;
the nearer view there Is a blank which Ist
at once noticeable. It should, however, not.
be so pronounced as to draw the attention
from the main subject of the picture; but'
must rather be In subjection to It; and if .
possible should be broken up. For eTarn-:

MAN WHO MADE THE

JOHN MORRISEY. the popular lo

brated his fifth year as manager
of the Orpheum. When Mr. Mor
risey took . charge of that playhouse
on February 2S, 1895, its fortunes were
at a low ebb and its future was not re
assuring. Under the direction of Mr.
Morrisey, however, there was a
marked and immediate change in the'
affairs of the - theater. .It: quickly
sprang into public favor, and the pros
perity which has since, followed is
ascribed almost entirely to the ability
displayed by its manager. .,
Â¦ One of the best evidences of Mr. Mor
rtsey's success is the fact that he has
made the Orpheum the favorite resort
of the women and children of the best
families in the city. There is probably
no man In local theatrical circles bet
ter known or better liked than John
Morrisey. In commencing his sixth

lived with her, and together with others
exerted such an influence over her that
she prejudiced Mrs. Â¦ Martin â¢ against her
family, representing that they, no longer

well, in hand, he relapsed Into a reverie,
allowing Clem" Jenkins on Flamora to' steal
through on^ the rail, and, brought t6:a
drive, was beaten a neck. In the' event
'.previous, with the leg up on Acrobat, he
did the same thing, permitting Henry,
astride. Tempo, to down him a head. Spen

some of his recent rides have been very

. An upset marked the running of th?

backing, with a quiet play on Momentum,
at one time 10 to 1. - Just as it looked a? if
little Johnny Daly, would get home first
on Jael, a 30 to 1 outsider, Ruiz droppei
from the clouds with Momentum, winning
by a head. Limerrck tired at ihe last post,
finishing third. " "
Following this came a sprint over tlie
Futurity course, won- by Lost Girl. The

favorite. Mountebank; ran third.
â¢Barney Schrelber's sweet filly Sofola
seemed imbued with more speed than ever,
the four and a half furlong spin being
only a Jog for her. Lucidia took the place
two lengths in front of Beelzebub. ?
â¢At one time during the mile and a quar

saved ground with the chestnut horse
from that" time on, finally downing Acro

favorite, finishing fourth. The start, after
a-- tedious delay, was a ragged one. Viorls

CHAPTER OF BRITISH
REVERSES IS CLOSED
LONDON, March 2.â Spencer ."Wilkinson
in the Morning Post says:
"Lord Roberts has taken the true meas
ure of the Boers and has thereby shown
his mastery -of what Napoleon called 'the
'divine part of the art of war.'
?"N6 doubt the chapter of British-re
verses is now closed. He would be a- bold
strategist' who could now offer to. the Boer
leaders a plan of Campaign prbmlsirig
ultimate success. '. â¢Â¦' "â¢ â¢ 'Â¦,-
"Lord Roberts' will soon have a -force -of
60,000. men. The Boer commander-in-chlef
can'now hope for but little from strategy.
On his Interior lines- he Is not strong
enough, while detaining one British army,
to strike with effect' against- the other.
He may possibly attempt to hold General
Buller at the passes leading out of Natal,
where. a- small force, at some risk to Itself,
can .cause considerable delay. ' Meantime
he may' gather, his . forces In the Free
State for resistance to I>ord Roberts. I
"If. Lord Kitchener is. at-. Arundel it
would . seem to imply an intention to re
store the railways and to open direct com
munication with Bloemfontein. â¢ .
. ."The statement that a force of Boera
under Commandant Dutoit has crossed
the Vaal. River. at Fourteen Streamsac
counts, perhaps; for a portion of General
Crorije's army and portends '. further
trouble for -Maf eking. â¢â¢â¢â¢/-.Â¦ . ' V : ,- ' .. .
"It., looks possible that .the Boer forces
may" now collapse altogether, although
that must not- be counted upon. Lord
Roberts, however, will 'soon have troops
enough to deal with any guerrilla warfare
and- altogether, there is' no- need " for
furtfrer. uneasiness. ". -.!"-.-
"The nation is proud of Its troops'and
of. their commander-in-chlef. It is grate
ful to the colonists for their magnificent
proofs of imperial. unity. There will be
no . relax-atio.n In' the determination, to
carry' the' war through to- the end."'

Roberts' advance, have been removed.
The news of General Cronje's surrender
