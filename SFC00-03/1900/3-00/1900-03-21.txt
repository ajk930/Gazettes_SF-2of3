Captain Stone saw that . the . Alert . was
heading for him he ordered the sail taken
in . and -.Just kept Â¦ steerage way on the
boat. After some .maneuvering the.life
boat was got alongside the tug and in a
few minutes sixteen of the men | were
transferred â¢ to .the Alert, the , remainder
being left in the: boat- to steer and : take
care of- her while Â«he was -being 'towed
Into San Francisco. The only man ~ who
had to be helped aboard the j tug was
Chief Officer Fyfe. who was on the sick
list, having injured his arm about three
weeks aeo.
Rescued Ten. More.
As soon as the lifeboat was safely tow-
Ing astern Captain Trewren turned the
Alert's head for the pinnace and. In a
very short space of time Mate Mold arid
six of his men were on" the tug's deck.
The others were left aboard vto " steer

boat. - * ' Â¦ . 'â¢â¢-.. .-Â¦
."During the run. from Point Pedro to
San Francisco Captain Stone gave the fol
lowing account of the voyage: â¢
Â¦ "We left Iquique on February 2 with a
cargo of niter consigned to Balfour, Guth
rie & C 0.,". said he. . VWe started with a
southerly wind, which soon turned into
the southeast trades. These were moder
ate throughout, but carried us along at
a fair, rate and we crossed the equator
on February 21 in longitude UO west. We
lost the southeast trades the following
day and did not get the northeast trades
until February 21 in latitude' s degrees
north, longitude 112 degrees 30 minutes
west. These were light throughout and
we lost them on March 9 in . latitude 29
degrees 30 minutes north, longitude 12S
degrees 30 minutes west.
"We had light variable winds and 'calms
up to, the 18th inst.. but the next dayâ
the day of our misfortuneâ we had a
strong northwest breeze up to 8 p. m.
The wind then fell light and I put the
ship under easy canvas as I was ex
pecting every minute to see the Farallones
light. Although there had -been a good
breeze throughout the day the weather
was clear and I was able to make good
observations at noon and 4 p. m. I had
and have still every confidence that .my
chronometer was correct, so . the only
reason I can give for the loss of my "ship
is that there must have ' been a : strong
current setting south of which I, was not
aware. Judging from my noon observa
tion the ship was at least twenty: miles
out of her course .when she T struck.
How the Wreck Occurred.
"Chief Officer ' Fyf e \ had - been i'slck for

GOES ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE WRECKED NEW YORK
The City of : Florence^ Just. Befo^;GbingVon Montara Reef.
{From, a Description Furnished by Captain Stone.] '
crpra KOTHER vessel has laid her bones
//\ bes!de the remains of those
If- â A which have gone to destruction in
H y>the vicinity of â¢ Half moon Bay.
The strong southerlj' current and
deadly inset that makes for Pigeon Point
is responsible for many a disaster and
now it has to answer for the loss of the
gx>od ship City of Florence, which, was
wrecked on Montara reef last Monday
eight at 9:30 o'clock.
The captain thought his vessel was off
the Farallones and sent the third mate
aloft to see if be could see the light. The
mate reported "no light In sight," but
eald be thought he saw breakers ahead.
He was ordered to co aloft and make^
sure, but before he was half way to the
masthead the lookout on the forecastle
head gave the warning, "breakers
ahead." The helm was at once put up,
the yards squared and the ship rapidly
paid off toward the cast. Almost" Immedi
ately she struck, but came off. but In an
other minute or so she struck again and
stuck fast. The carpenter sounded the
pumps and found six feet of water In the
hold. The pumps were manned and an at
tempt made to stem the inrushing flood.
Tie carpenter made another sounding and
found ten feet of water in the hold. The
ehlp at this time began to careen to star
board and Captain Stone Â¦ ordered the
boats lowered. â¢ -
Lowered the Boats.
The port lifeboat and the plnnacÂ»Â» were
launched, the former being , occupied by
Captain Stone and eighteen of the crew,
while in the latter were Mate Mojd and
eight men. The men . all saved their
belongings, but the officers got away
with only what they stood In when the
ehlp struck.
Although the City of Florence went
aehore on Monday night it was not until
yesterday about Ip. m. that. the news of
the disaster reached the city. From Half
moon Bay came the news that the vessel
was rapidly going to pieces and that prob
ably all tlie crew had escaped, as two
boats had been seen heading north. As
soon as John D. Epreckels. proprietor of
The Call, was informed of the state of
affairs he at once ordered out ,the tug
Alert and gave Captain "Joe" Trewren
Instructions to 2nd the shipwrecked men
and bring them into port. About two
miles north of Point Pedro the ship
wrecked men were sighted and the tug
at once bore down toward the lifeboat.
Both boats were under sail. The life
boat had a "lusr" set. while four men la
bored at the oars. The pinnace carried
a jib and mainsail and two men were at
work rowing. The pinnace held the bet
ter position and was making good head
way, while the lifeboat was closer -in-,
chore and was slowly but surely being*
carried in toward the beach. As soon as
my: surprise to him that we did not pick
.up the Farallones light and sent him aloft
i to; see ; lf ' he could get \a ' sight of It. *It
.was then 'about 9:30 p. m. and a clear
night: The moon was about half. an hour
above the horizon and all seemed.' calm
and .peaceful.* There ; was just'enough
wind to 1 keepthe upper and lower topsails
and ; the. fore topmast-staysails filled- and
.steerage, way, on ..the. ship. . ". -
.'"When the mate came downrhe iold.me
there was not a lights in -sight, but that
he/ thought ; ! he 'saw" breakers- ahead
through the haze.'-' I * ordered him- aloft
again, to. make. sure, but he had not -.got
as -far as -the foremast head when"".D^ck
McKeever, the man on* the lookout, yelled,
: 'Breakers ". on 'the' port bow.' " -I. at once,
ordered .. th'el helm'up \ and j the Rafter yards

to pay 'off- tdward the east,' .but.- in* a] few
seconds \ she.'. struck. ; Judging from 'Â¦Â¦; the 1
sound. she, must have gone on a rock but
slipped off; into ideep water." again. ; There
must have been, over twenty, feet of .water

In ; two minutes we again and I

LOSSES OF THE BOERS.
LONDON. March 20.â A statement
comes from Pretoria admitting that the
Boer losses during the war exceed 7000.
No fresh news has been received from
Mafeklng, but a Pretoria dispatch ' dated
Thursday, March 15. asserts that Colonel
Plumer- has not been" able to advance
south of Lobatsi.
LONDON. March a.â News from the
front yesterday was favorable to
the British arms. The Dutch re
volt in Cape> Colony is practically
over, and Lord Kitchener has en
tered Prieska without opposition. ICen
hardt, the other center of the movement.
Is likely to submit as tamely.
General Rrabant is moving on Routvllle.
Free State burghers continue to surren
der.
Mafeking is still holding out, while the
relief columns are getting nearer every
day. The blowing up of bridges over the
Modder shows that the Boers Intend to
hamper Lord Roberts' advance as much
as possible.
Meanwhile supplies nre bÂ«?!ng accumu
lated, and Eloenifontein is converted into
a great base for the next advance. When
the right moment arrives, three armies
ere likie!y to be put in movement, the
main force under Lord Roberts in the
center, marching on Kroonstadt; the
light wing, under General Buller, threat
ening the line of RisEarsben?, and prob
ably making a groat turning movement
via Vryheid and to the north, and the left
â¢wing, under either Lord Methuen or
Lord Kitchener, advancing to Klerksdorp
and Pot chef stroom.
In consequence of the Boer threats to
destroy the town of Johannesburg and
the plants of the surrounding gold mines,
h^r Majesty's Government has resolved to
lrsue a proclamation at once In South
Africa, holding the members of the
Transvaal executive council responsible
for acts committed contrary to the usages
of civilized people. The proclamation will
give formal effect to the warning con
voyed to President Kruger by Mr. Cham
berlain some time. ago.
The fact that the proclamation Is is
tued by the Colonial Ofllce is regarded
as a significant Indication that thÂ« re
publics will be administered as crown
colonies. In this connection it Is under
stood that the leaders of the opposition
la Parliament now admit that, no other
fettl^me-tu is possible, since the republics
Insist upon their demand for absolute In
dependence. In view of this the efforts
of the Liberals will be confined to secur
ing in the settlement the best treatment
for the Dutch population. Including secur-
Uy against their disfranchisement.
A Khodesian field force, 5000 strong; is
to be commanded by Sir Frederick Car

WALLACE, Idaho.. March SO.â Peter
Bernier was arrested to-day and charged
with complicity in the murder of Freder

of the Helena-Frisco mill on Canyon
Creek. . On the night of December 2, 1897,
he was taken from his room by masked
men, led down the railroad track and
shot. Whitney came here from Butte,
where he had influential relatives. A re
ward of Sl5OO was offered for tho arrest
and conviction of the guilty men and Gov
ernor Steunenberg offered an additional
reward of fIOOO for each guilty man con
victed, but the reward was never claimed.
The general . impression Is that Bernier
was not a member of the mob, but that
he knows much more than he. told on the
witness stand at the inquest. Â¦.*

"lour Excellency's telegram reached rcÂ»(yÂ«.*

more than that my burÂ«rherp should make them

that you must bav<Â» been mistaken. I have
made personal Inquiry of General Delarey, who

that on Saturday, the date being illegible, the
British troops when they were about fifty yards
from our position put up their hands as well
as a white flag, while at the same time your
cannon bombarded the said troops, with the re
suit that Commandant De Beer was wounded.

"On the contrary." he says, "the opera

the fact that General Buller kept 16,000
Boers occupied. It would be a cruel and
unworthy thing to deprive the Natal army
of their hard won laurels and none would
more vigorously repudiate such a sugges

WASHINGTON, March 20.â 1n the Sen
ate to-day when the measure providing a

Rico was reached Morgan of Alabama an
nounced his desire to speak upon it. The
special topic of his discussion was the
question of the extension of the consti
tution over the territory acquired by the
United States. Comparing our authority
in Cuba and Porto Rico, Morgan declared
that resistance to American authority in
Cuba would be as much rebellion as It Is
iri the Philippines. The national power
must continue to exist in all of the ac
quired islands until Congress shall leg
islate in their regard. .
â¢ "The world," "he declared, "must be
amused at our discussion of the question
whether the Philippines are part of the
United States while we are yotlng armies,

Â»
WASHINGTON, March 80.â The Secre
tary of the Navy has received a cable
gram from Admiral Watson stating that
the gunboat Wheeling had proceeded to
Taku. She will be relieved by the Con
cord about May 10. and will go as usual
In the summer to Unalaska, on the Alas
ka coast .
; The State Department is In a quandary
to devise means to -render effective : pro
tection to the American missionaries at
' Shantung.: The difficulty lies In the fact
that the missionaries -have In most cases
gone as far as 200 miles Inland, and are
thus beyond reach "of any aid that I could
' be extended from a warship. Mr. Conger's
advices show that the situation is fur
ther complicated by the fact that the lo
cation of the present â¢ troubles is so far
Inland as to make It difficult to. determine
whether or not the "boxers" are operat
ing in Shantung or across ' the border In
Pechlll province.' If the threatened mis
sionaries are -in Western Shantung then
a further question arises as to who is
chargeable with their protection. China
or Germany.
The exact extent of the German sphere
of influence is not definitely known here.
It Is 200 miles from Klaochau, the German
seaport, to the western border of Shan
tung, but, inasmuch as the Germans have
claimed exclusive control of railroad fran
chises and like concessions throughout the
whole province, it is presumed that they
have assumed military responsibility as
well. At any rate, the Chinese Govern
ment has been deterred from attempting
to exercise military authority in that sec
tion by the attitude of the German au
thorities, and that is the reason for the
inability of the Peking Government to â¢
'meet Mr. Conger's demand for minatory
measures against the "boxers." The Ger
man Minister at Peking has informed
Mr. Conger: that his Government Is will
ing to extend to the American missionar
ies within the German sphere of Influence
the same measure of protection as Is ac
corded to German missionaries.'
however, Is not very reassuring, In view
of the fact that the Â¦ German ' military
forces In Shantung have not, so far as Is
known, been augmented to- a point where
they are equal to policing the -whole
province. .. Â¦â¢.â¢'Â¦â¢ \J '
The State Department has not been ad
vised that these German forces have ex
tended . their - operations . Into Western
Shantung, where the Imperiled mission
aries are located, nor has there been any
assurance that any expedition Is. organ
ized in that Â¦direction. â¢â¢_â¢- _. -

SAN JACIXTO, March . 20.â The fact
that a mountain has recently fallen
is turning all eyes, scientific as well
as curious, to San Jacinto. This
mountain or spur of the San Jacinto
peak has already been visited by- nun-*
dreds of local people. .The. camera. fiend
is here by dozens, and newspaper corre
spondents drive In dally. To show the i ex
tent of this great natural catastrophe it
is well . to understand that the San"
; Jacinto peak is 11,000 feet above the.
: sea level, and that the fallen spur had
an altitude of "4000 feet until Christmas
day, when the great Christmas temblor,
shattered its moorings, and now it lies, a
fallen giant. 200 feet below the Jagged
peaks it waa torn down. /.
Was It the result of gravitation or was
It a direct _upheaval Â¦ from, the earth's
bowels beneath the huge mass of earth
and granite?
Question for Geologists.
This Is a question for learned geologists
to solve, but in the meantime the mind is
staggered when contemplating the 600 to
1000 acres of chaos, split across with bot
tomless "fissures, small canyons lost en
tirely under millions of tons of earth, and
valleys tipped to the east when, once they
undulated to the west.
It Is not unlike climbing ' the Swiss
mountains to reach . the sunken tract.
Twelve miles from San Jacinto the road
reaches a bridle path or forest rangers'
trail.- There' one's nerves must be strong,
as the trail Is precipitous and as one as
cends the eye gazes down .hundreds of
feet of perpendicular foothills. . _. .
On Sunday the trail was black with peo
ple anxious to see the fallen mountain. It
requires an. hour's hard riding to reach
the mountain's broken rim.' Fully 150 feet'
below He3'an upturned grove of manza
nita trees. Long furrows of fresh earth
attract the attention, and there is: be
held a jumble such as might have existed
during the formative period. A great
slanting side of blue shale on the eastern
edge of the basin indicates plainly where
the mountain shook itself loose ' and
hurled, Itself, at an angle of forty de
grees. Into the space where valleys; and
canyons had been*slnce time immemorial.
Thus the underground explosions, which
occurred after Christmas and which were
heard every few hours for two months at
San Jacinto, In conjunction with strong
seismic tremors, which were always from
the direction of Mount San Jacinto, are
now to a certain. extent explained.

a .vent in this particular mountain and,
blowing up, have caused the earthquake.
â¢"I was of the opinion at first that most
of? the falling in of the mountain occurred

mold together like putty. A week's ex
posure to the sun renders It very brittle.

that it was the explosion of gases and

viewed had theories worth considerable.
He said: ; .

: "When I visited the mountain I noticed
me of my honest, true friend and most
valiant supporter."
All the members of the diplomatic corps
to-day handed in their cards at the resi
dence of the late general.
Up to the appearance of Edhem Pasha,
-with whom rest the laurels of the Greco-
Turkish war of 1897, Ghazi Osman Pasha
was regarded as "the Only" Turkish gen
eral. He was the g-reat reserve force of
the Sultan. Indeed, the retirement in
which he passed the greater part of his
life since the Russo-Turkish war in 1576
was said to be due in a great measure
to the Sultan's habitual suspicious atti
tude toward those who had rendered the
greatest cervices to his throne. Abdul
Hainid, however, from time to time, paid
him marks of regard.
"The hero of Plevna," who Inflicted on
the Russian invaders the greatest check
they suffered In the campaign, was made
chief of the Imperial Guard and Marshal
of the Palace. For a time he held the
position of Governor General of Crete, and
in 157S was Minister of War. when he in
trodure-d many reforms into the Turkish
army.
Three years ago. when the Greeks had
pained a temporary success at Melouna
Pass, in the north of Thessaly. the Sultan,
Impatient with Edhem Pasha, ordered
Osman Pasha to take chief command.
The general, who was then G5. started for
the front, but the rapid development of
Edhem Pasha's plans, leading to the fall
of Pnareala. decided the Sultan to leave
the direction of the campaign in Edhem's
hands and Osman returned to Constan
tinople, where he lived In seclusion to the
time of his death.
Splendid Defense of Plevna.
"1 compliment you on your defense of
Plevna. It was one of the most splendid
military feats In history."
This was the greeting of Grand Duke
Nicholas of Russia to Osman Pasha as
he met him after the surrender.. Prince
Charles of Roumania and General Sko
beloff as warmly acknowledged the gal
lantry of the defense. The Turkish gen
eral had on the flat clay fields created a
fortress which for & time seemed impreg
nable. By the entrenchments he caused
to be thrown up he arrested for four
months the advance of the Russians. In
three pitched battles he overcame the
finest troops of the. Czar's armies.
On July 1. 1876. he inflicted a loss of
SOOu killed and wounded on his assailants.
The next battle cost the Russians 170 offi
cers and 7136 men, and a three days' stub
born assault of Skobeloff. later on, when
the Russian Grenadiers got within 500
yards of the- trenches, but failed to pass
the fire zone, ended in a Russian loss of
from IS.OuQ to 20,000 men.
It was resolved to starve out the army
of Osman, which originally numbered
about 56,<X>0 men, and an army of 120,000
Russians completed the investment. At
length, forty-live days after the close
elege had been established and 144 day^
after his own arrival at Plevna, Osman
determined on a desperate attempt to cut
his way through. The struggle was of the
fiercest sort, but many hours of bayonet
fighting ended in the Turks being driven
back and the "defender of Plevna sur
rendered with the honors of war."
Was a Man of Iron Will.
The title Ghazl (the victorious),- confer
red on Osman by the Sultan, had not been
bestowed on a Turkish subject for nearly
three hundred years.
In his personal appearance. , though not
much above middle stature, Osman Pasha
waÂ« of athletic build, with a superb head.

'if an extinct crater existed under this
great mountain and if by external' dis

RED CDATED
BULLY SCORED
BY DR. JORDAN
Aristocracy, Militarism and
Imperialism De
nounced.
Only Bace Degeneration Ever Known
Is That Due to One or All of
the Above-Named
Causes.
NEW YORK. March 20.â Dr. David
Starr Jordan, president of the Leland
Stanford University, was the speaker at
a meeting of the Patria Club held in the
banquet hall of the Hotel Savoy to-night.
His subject was ."The Blood of the Na
tion." Dr. Jordan began by saying- that
It is recognized that the blood of a nation
in a large degree determines its history,
and that, in a similar fashion, the his
tory of a nation determines its blood. He
said In part:
The only way in -which any rac^ as a whole
has improved has been through the preservation
of its beet and the loss of Us worst examples.
The condition which favors this 1Â« democracy,
equality before the la-w, or the condition which
equalizes opportunity and gives to each man the
rlcrht to stand or fall on the powers God has
tlven him.
The only race degeneration ever known is
that which Is produced by one or all of de
mocracy's arch enemiesâ slavery, aristocracy,
militarism and imperialismâ the four tyrants
of human politics, not one of which appears
without the others.
Degeneracy of the Individual is quite another
thins and has Its own series of causes. . A. lot
of crazy painters, drunken musicians, maudlin
poets and sensation hunter* on the boulevards
prove nothing as to race deeeneracy. Any
man of any race may. degenerate In an envir
onment of vice, disease and absinthe, but he
may leave his race all the cleaner for his de
generation.
War may seem to make men strong when
the hot passions are on, but hot passion is not
inherited, least of all when the warrior is slain
and leaves no Inheritance. War can only waste
and corrupt. If any war is {rood civil war
must be best. The virtues of victory and the
lessons of defeat would be kept within the na
tion. It would protect the nation from the
temptation to flgrht for gold or trade. The rem
edy for most Ills of men Is not to be sought
In war, not in whirlwinds of rebellion that
shake the world, but In peace and Justice,
equality amonsr men and the/ cultivation of
those virtues we call Christian, because they
have been virtues ever since man and society
beran and will be virtues still when the era
of strife Is past and the redcoat bully In his
boots no longer hides the march of man from

outside, edges of the mountain had fallen
outward, ' the force .of gravity pulling
them into two caverns lying at either, side
of i the 600 ; acres. "; .' , -Â¦Â¦-.- ; â¢
: Mr. Daggett, a merchant, said that he
was certain - that the 'Christmas earth
quake was caused, by the falling In of
this mountain. He said: .
."'Consider the 'force of an accumulation
of gas great enough to burst through mil
lions of tons of earth a mile square. Why
would. it not vibrate the State from San
Diego to San Francisco? .The gas ac
cumulated - after great stores of water
were pumped out by the numerous pump
ing plants here and at Perrls. The dry
years have also robbed the surplus. Yes,
the Christmas quake had its origin right
under that fallen mountain, but was not
of volcanic origin."
Professor Davidson's Views.
Professor George Davidson Is familiar
with the general characteristics of the
San Jacinto- Mountain. He said yester
day that he would not like to enter upon
a discussion of the . happenings recorded
as > taking place there/because he did not
really know any of the facts by personal
observation. Evidently there had been a
disturbance on a large scale. San Jacinto
Mountain was 10,987 feet high. He was
once advised to go upon the mountain to
make observations, . but he considered the
mountain too steep to make it possible to
carry a large telescope - to the summit,
consequently he located for his observa
tions upon . "old Grayback" Mountain,
which is twenty-four - miles distant.
The steepness Â¦ of, San ' Jacinto I Mountain
has a bearing In considering the recently
reported disturbance. It was conceiv
able. Prof essor . Davidson said, that a
huge landslide | should have swept down
a vast mass of matter from the peak. He
had seen the path of a landslide in Alaska
that was an eighth of . a mile wide and
half a mile long. It had uncovered solid
rocks and left them bare. "...-' ;i . :â¢ .
'Concerning the -earthquakes he said
that he,, of course, knew nothing. Nor
could he explain the report about the
igneous rock. It would take a mineralo
gist and geologist to speak with authority
as to whether the rock mentioned were
really lgenous. The San Gorgonlo Pass,
he .said, t lies between San Bernardino
Mountain and San Jacinto Mountain. The

LOUISVILLE, Ky.. March Â».â The stor
ies growing out of the conference between
Sergeant F. Wharton Golden of the Bar
boursvtlle company of State militia and
the attorneys who are managing thÂ« In
vestigation of the assassination of Gov
ernor Goebel have caused a sensation
throughout the State. Golden will be
placed on the stand by the prosecution In
the trial. of the persons already arrested
for alleged complicity in the assassination,
but Information as to the exact natur* of
the testimony he Is expected to give la
lacking. Attorneys Campbell and Pos
grove naturally decline to discuss the
matter, and Golden will say nothing. Spe
cials from Winchester say Golden Is *tIU
at that place in company with his attor
ney. The two spend most of the time
about the hotels. They see all callers,
however, and talk freely on all subject*
except that of Golden's reported confes
sion. .
"I will do all I can for my friends all tha
time," Golden la reported as saying, -but
I * must first be true, to myself, whtn
the time comes I will tell all I know.
Whatever else may be said about me. I
don't think I can be accused of being a
liar, a coward or a Democrat, and I want
It i distinctly understood that I am not
here under guard."
The story Is published that Golden bai
divulged to the attorneys the name of the
man who fired the shots that killed Gov
ernor Goebel. Ihe person mentioned is a
mulatto, who formerly lived at Winches
ter, was prominent In the French-Eversole
feud and is known as a dead shot. Tho
man is now supposed to be in the wilds
of one of the mountain counties.
Evidence that he was in Franfcfort at
the time r.f the assassination waa found
among papers taken from W. 11. Coulton.
a 'clerk in the Auditor's office, when the
latter was arrested a week or so ago on
a warrant charging him with being an ac
cessory to the murder. Among there
papers were receipts for board bills
amounting to about $300 Incurred br
eighteen men who were in Frankfort for
some time before and at the time GtJv
ernor Goebel was shot. In one of these
receipts the name of the mulatto men
tioned is given. The receipt in this case
is for money received from John Perkln*
by Bettlna Plttman for the board of three?
men. Perkins Is a porter about the State

GOLDEN'S MYSTERIOUS
VISIT TO LEXINGTON
LEXINGTON*. Ky.. March 20.â Sergeant
F. 'Wharton- Golden, the man alleged to
have made incriminating statements in
the Goebel murder, arrived here. In com
pany with his attorney, Smith Hayes, to
night. They came from Winchester- Their
movements have been kept in the dark
and their presence was not known until
several - hours after their arrival. Â¦ They
did not register at the Phoenix Hotel, but
it is said Golden went through the rear
door of the Phoenix and subsequently to
his room- In the hotel. Another and most
probable story is that they were met by
a carriage and driven to the home of a
Goebel Democrat in the north end of tha
city. As the hotel clerk knew nothing of
their arrival efforts to find Golden proved
futile.
Many rumors are flying. One Is that he
Is trying- to get away from Goebel Influ
ences but is closely watched. It is prob
able that he has given them the slip. â¢ j\.n
other rumor Is that he is here for further
conference with Goebel attorneys to
morrow.

His uniform consisted usually of a jacket

presenting a contrast to that of other
Turkish generals. He generally wore a
loose blue cloak, with no apparent mark

Hack of all this man's domestic difficulties
is a love affair involving with his name
that of Miss Mary Browning, daughter of
a wealthy rancher of Woodland, and super
intendent of the Christian Sunday-school
of that city. The couple became acquaint
ed while Rev. Mr. Smith was guiding the
destinies of the Christian Church there,
about eight or ten months ago. The asso
ciation of the pair, which was viewed
with suspicion by the community, reached
the climax of a scandal early this month
at the little town of Princeton. Colusa
County, where Rev. Mr. Smith and the
joung woman met by prearrangtment at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Hart,
Â¦where they remained" for several days,
during which time their conduct was
euch as to shock the people of the set
tlement." This resulted in the sending of
words of warning to their hostess, who
took the Woodland girl to task for . her
indiscreet actions, forcing from her an ad
mission that a bond stronger than that
of friendship existed between her and the
pastor.

while he was stationed at Woodland, long
before any trouble had sprung up between
liim and his wife. By a strange coinci
dent his protestations of affection became,
more ardent, about the time he filed a suit
against his wife for a divorce, claiming
thai he had made the discovery that they
were cousins. Stranger still, at the very
time when Smith had switched his plea
and was showing his Christian spirit by
branding hi* wife as unfaithful, this min
ister of the gospel was hieing himself to
the trysting place at Princeton to meet
the new love before he had fairJy aban
doned the oldâ at least before the courts
had taken cognizance of his story and
allowed him to dissolve his vow to "love,
honor and cherish" the wife whom he
has now cast aside. Â¦ Â¦ - ;-i '-:, '
Such is the Rev. Mr. Smith,. and in view
of recent developments' in his career it is
hard to believe that he has made any
sacrifice in order that he might "pursue
his Christian work unfettered." but it is
Â«>asy to imagine that he sacrificed the
pood name and honor of his wife in order
to pursue his love-making with less ic
etrictiori.
The Clandestine Meeting. '
Rev. Mr. Smith did more than this when
he ar.d his Woodland love arranged their
clandestine meeting at the ' Hart home,
near Princeton. He exposed- to the dan
ger of public scorn Mrs. Hart, whose hos
pitality he abused and who was innocent
of any knowledge of Smith's visit until
he arrived on the scene, bag andbaggage.
the day after the object of his affections
reached Princeton. When the position in
which the pastor had placed. her dawned
upon Mrs. Hart she was compelled. In
order to protect her own good name and
quell the rourmuringof disapproval among
her neighbors, to go to them, apologize
for the conduct of gay Guy Smith and aU
lady love and tell them that the meeting
at her home was not of her arranging. â¢ â¢
The story of Guy Smith's latest love af
fair runs back many months. In its earlier
stages, when the minister was still In
Woodland, an angry father threatened' to
periouÃly interfere in the matter. Mr.
Browning, shocked at the rumors that
Smith was displaying too great affection
for Miss Mary. and neglecting Mrs.. Smivh.
forbade his daughter to associate with th.Â»
minister, and -by way of emphasis gave
gey Guy to understand that if he -did nut
cease his attentions :Yolo County would
be too small for both families.
A Web of Oily Words.'
When Smith first forgot his duty to hit
wife and his borne and began to ensnare
Miss Browning in his web of oily words
and protestations of affection Mrs. Hart,
who was then Miss Holloway, was super
intendent of the Woodland Sunday school,
and her assistant was the young woman
whom Smith bad marked for his victim. A
ehort time after Woodland congratulated
itself upon the departure of Smith and be
gan to sympathize with Oakland for hav
ing to suffer him to reside within the lim
its of that city Miss Holloway and Fred
Hart, a wealthy young rancher of Pr'r.ce
ton, concluded to get married. ; They went
to Oakland, where Rev. Guy Smith. tied
the knot. On that occasion Mrs. Hart in-,
vited â¢ the minister to visit the - Princeton
ranch when be felt the need of a rest !rou
V
the pair should visit her at the same time,
knowing ihat the father of Smith's Wood
land flame had forbidden her assoc'atlon
with the preacher. She reconciled herself
vrith the hope that it was only a coinci
dence after all and made the best of it
until the murmurings of the country folk
reached her ears and her brother, a
prominent Colusa doctor, warned her to
beware or she would become involved in
the scandal which he was sure would fol
low.
Tne twilight rambles of Brother Smith
and the "sister" of the Woodland Sunday
school along the lonely country roadsides
had not escaped the notice nor the com
ment of the people of Princeton. "Lov
ers, no doubt, was the early verdict un
til the word was passed that the man was
a minister, the Rev. Guy Smith, who was
suing one wife for a divorce and had not
hesitated to blast her life with cruel ac
cusations of infldolity.
Then' came the murmurings of contempt
for Smith; his hostess fell in for a share
of the public scorn, for her neighbors
jumped to the conclusion that she was
cognizant of their "doings" and had ar
ranged the meeting. ' ..-â¢;..â-
This forced her to declare her position
in the- matter and apologize for*, her
guests. She took her Woodland friend to
task for placing her in such an embar
rassing situation and demanded to know
the nature of the bond which evidently,
existed between the -Woodland Sunday
school superintendent and the pastor of
the First Christian Church of Oakland.
Miss Browning's Confession.
Miss Browning confessed that the feel
ing between them- was more than that
which surrounds mere friendship. She
confessed to Mrs. Hart that she and
Smith were lovers and ultimately would
become husband and wife if nothing in
terfered. with their plans. . She confessed
that the Rev." Mr. Smith's motive in suing
his wife for divorce was not "to place him
in such a light that he could, unfetNsred,
pursue his duties as a minister ,ol the
gospel." She confessed that the purpose
was to destroy the barrier which stood
between them and the altar. She con
fessed that the charges brought against
Mrs. Smith by her husband .had no foun
dation in fact, â¢" Â¦ '
. Mrs. Hart was shocked Â¦ beyond ' meas
ure at the revelations and the early de
parture of her guests was' made neces
sary. Rev. Mr. Smith suggested . to I Miss
Browning that" they leave the ranch to
gether. Mrs. Hart pleaded with them not
to give further excuses ' for scandal by
puch action, but Smith insisted and their
departure together on the train for the
south is still the talk of the little town
of Princeton.
Smith's Unsavory Reputation.
Miss Browning. is a member of one of
the most estimable families in Woodland,
I where for years she bore an unblemished
reputation. Rev. Mr. Smith is roundly
condemned for his conduct toward her
and it is the general belief that he ex
ercises some hypnotic influence over her.
As the facts in the 'case have gradually
;become public in C6lusa; Princeton and
-Woodland, the feeling against Smith runs
high and it would.be the height of in
discretion on his' part to repeat his visit
to any of the places named;
. In Colusa, where he was formerly lo
cated, he does not bear a good reputation.
Rev. W. P. Rcagar. the Christian minis
ter there, has for. some time been gather
ing -evidence against him in support of a
request that he withdraw from' the church
for the good "of the institution's . name.
Many of the merchants of Colusa remem
ber Smith to their sorrow. - ,' ; Â¦
Down at Pacific Grove, where he also
held forth at one time, discreditable
stories are circulated i about â¢ him. â¢ Â¦ ;Â¦-' Â¦
Rev. Mr. Smith is either a wolf in
sheep's clothing or he entertains peculiar
ideas of Christianity and, the duties of a
minister of the Gospel. -â¢..â¢â¢ â¢>

of the committee except Senator Pettus,
and.it recommends the adoption of the
following resolution: -
Kosolved. That Nathan B. Scott has been
duly elected as a Senator from the State of
West Virginia for the term of bU years com
mencing on the 4th of March, 1599, and that
he is entitled to a seat in the Senate as such.
The committee discussed all the objec
tions of the protestants, but the greater
part ; uf the report is devoted to the
charge that the two hold-over Senators,
Getzendanner and Pearson, voted for
Scott while they held commissions in the
volunteer army and that the agreement
whereby contests in the Legislature were
suspended while a joint assembly for the
election of a Senator was held was "void
as against public. policy."
The first of these .points is dismissed
upon the ground that . the State Senate
passed favorably upon the qualifications
as members of the two soldier Senators.
On this point the committee says:
The Senate of West Vlrsinia is thÂ» only
tribunal which could hear and determine law
fully these objections to the qualifications of
Senators Getrendanner and Pearson.. Its Judg
ment In their favor is final. The Senate of the
United States has no authority to originate,
hear or determine any objections to the qualifi
cations of those who acted and voted as mem
bers of the Senate of the State.
On the point raised as to the- Joint as
sembly the committee says:
It may be that wrong and Injustice- to mem
bers, and contestants was done and Intended to
be done on one side "or the other, â¢ or on both
sides. . There Is no evidence of , force or fraud

.Secretary Boot's Refusal to Given XTp

,, ered to Have Been

WASHINGTON, March 20.â The House
to-day entered upon the consideration of
the Loud bill to restrict the character; of
publications entitled to pound rates as sec
ond class mail matter. The bill has been
before Congress for several years/ Loud
defended the bill In a long speech. Con
siderable opposition to the measure was
developed. ''..^ -^ V-:
Before the bill was taken up Sulzer of
New York delivered'a denunciation of the
administration in - connection with his
resolution of inquiry calling upon the War
Department for- information as to what
fortifications Great Britain is erectmg on
the Canadian border. The Committee on
Military Affairs submitted a reply of Ad
jutant General Corbin saying such Infor
mation was secret, but that Great Brit
ain was erecting no works which threat
ened our rights. The committee recom
mended that "the resolution He on. the
table. The House sustained the commit
tee's recommendation by a vote of 110 to
97.
Previous to the vote Sulzer, by unani
mous consent, took the floor for five mln
uptes to debate the resolution. He said:
Mr. Speaker, this resolution was Introduced
in good faith and with a popular demand for
legitimate Information, which the; War De
partment should furnish: to -this House, .-In or
der that it can properly consider and transact
its business. There is nothing in the resolution
which calfs for any secret Information from
tho War Department. It is very strange, it
seems to me,' that the Committee on Military
Affairs are so sensitive in regard to the resolu
tion. Â¦ The report from the adjutant general is
preposterous and untenable. He says that this
information is secret. This resolution calls for
no secret information. He says . that Great
Britain- Is' not trespassing upon our territory.
No onÂ» contends that Great Britain Is tres-
I>asstngr on our territory. How ridiculous it
is for the adjutant general to say. that in this
report. . . ' ' -
Attacks the Administration.
What we do declare, and what ' every thlnk
lnjr and . Intelligent citizen of this country
â¢ know*. Is that while Great Britain ispretend-
Idr to be our friend she is sedulously and con
sistently erecting great fortifications; on our
northern frontier which menace the Integrity
of the republic and -which on notice of twenty
four hours could destroy our cities, our towns
and lay 'waste it>* property of >our peoDle. It
seems to me tJWI to-day the administration
Is being humbinpfbd by. the administration of
Great Britain. . .
The gentleman frcm . Illinois the other day
reported to this House the fortification : bill,
carrying' an appropriation of three or four
millions, more than the last appropriation bill.
We want this information In order to Intelli
gently . know what fortifications we ought to
erect In opposition to the. fortifications .Great
Britain is erecting. I think this resolution
should pass. There is a feeling all over the
country that the administration has absolutely
and abjectly surrendered American rights to
British interests. It has done so in Alaska; it
has done so In regard to the Nicaragua canal ;
it is doing so now in the Orient, in the Philip
pines, In China. It has been done by Great
Britain In this war In South Africa, (Applause
on Democratic side.) If it had not been for
what the administration did. the; other day,
after consultation with Lord -Pauncefote. after
being told what to do by Sallsbursv-.there would
have been a concert of EhiropeftrOSgwers which
would nave 'demanded the -oessatfim of war In
South Africa. The administration here Is more
English than the administration .In London,
and it Is time for Roroe < one to stand ur> here

interests? . (Loud applause from the -Democratic!

REGULATES DISPOSAL
OF ESTATES OF ALIENS
Senate Considers a New : Treaty - r Be-
tween - Great' Britain : and the
. United States.
WASHINGTON, March 20.â The Senate
to-day in executive session considered- the
treaty between the United j States and
Great Britain regulating the disposal of
the estates of citizens of one country who
may die in the other country. Senator
Wolcott of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations had charge of the treaty anl ex
plained the legal bearing of the agree
ment, saying that it covered practically,
the same ground- as treaties with other
countries on the 1 same subject. . Senator
Davis, chairman of the Committee.on For
eign Relations, also made a statement In
support of the treaty.' ...
Senator Bacon of the same committee
criticised the treaty as conferring a power
upon the Federal Government In the regu
lation of estates which was an infringe
ment upon the rights of the- States and
Territories." He pointed out that the pond."
ing treaty goes further than any agree
ment with any other power . in- the
fringement of this right, and he especially
criticised the authority granted by tho
treaty to the Queen of England or The
President of the United States to exiend
the provisions . of the treaty to depend
encies. ;%'.:;> â¢
The treaty was amended by striking out
the time limit for ratification, which made
it expire on the 2d inst. No vote was
reached, and -when the. Senate adjourned
there was an Understanding that the
treaty would ng-aln be taken up at 3
o'clock to-morrow.

a -nirTCB.TISE]ttENTS.REV. FATHER SEBASTIAN DABOVICH-
AN interesting lecture was delivered last nlffht at the Church of the Ad
vent by the Rev. Father Sebastian Dabovlch of the Russian Cathedral.
The subject of the discourse was. "The Relations Between Eastern and
Western Catholicism and What the Orthodox Church Has Done For
Russia." Seated on the platform with the reverend lecturer were Rt. - Rev.
Bishop Moreland, Episcopal Bishop of Sacramento, by whom he was lntro^
<JucÂ»*J; Rev. Father Parrish, rector of the Church of the Advent: Rev. Father
Radcllffe Rev. Edgar Lion. Rev. Father Bartlett and Rev. Mr. Monges.
In his lecture. Father Dabovlch spoke of the severe-struggle which the
GreÂ«k church has experienced in this country and Alaska. Ho deprecated
the fact that the Apostolic Catholic Church of Rusela had met with so little
interest and be attributed it to the unfavorable Jtcht ln which the Episcopal
and Ancllcan churches were placed, owing to the attitude of the â¢ Roman
church. The first part of the le-Hure was concluded with an earnest hope
that God will some day unite all branches of the Catholic church..
"Russia owes everything to- the orthodox church." said Father Dabovich,
"v.hlch created her government and endowed It with the breath of life. Rus
sia's strength lies in her orthodoxy and it is impossible to separate the idea
of religion from that of country. In preparing for battle whole armies have
prayed and received the sacraments. In the Mongolian Invasion it was the
orthodox faith that sustained and forted the people and finally delivered
Russia frcm her enemies." v "
At the conclusion of the lecture a collection was taken up* tor the joint
benefit oi the new Russian Cathedral and the payment of the debt on the
Church of the Advent. ' ' - '

verely burned yesterday by an unex
pected explosion. They were at work
ln the after hold of the ship, and to
aid them in their' labors they used a
lighted candle. \ Gas generated in the
hold and the men worked on without
knowing its proximity. "Â¦>
Winslow waÃ the first to suffer. ..He
advanced his candle ' into one of the
recesses of the hold and there was a
slight' explosion. The flames ignited
Winslow's shirt, and before he could
stop their, progress he 'was severely
burned on the left arm. This should
have been a warning to Anderson and
Peterson, but they continued their
work, unmindful of tljeir danger.
A few hours after the ' accident to
Winslow the explosion was repeated
through the same cause, . and both
men were terribly burned about the
head and face, and had to be removed
to the Harbor Receiving Hospital fOlf 01
treatment. Dr. Deaa worked on the
men for over an hour In an effort to
rellove their â¢. sufferings. After the
burns on ' their hands, face : and ; neck
had been â¢ dressed and the injured
parts bandaged .the men were allowed
to depart for, their, home at 703^Davis

Makes a Quick Trip Prom
Tahiti and Brings Lots

The Tropic Bird sailed Into port yester
day laden with 20.000 kilos of copra, 24,220
cocoanuts, one case of mother of pearl
shells, sixty-one tins of vanilla, six
cases of beans and one ton of coral. It
took the vessel thirty-three days to come
from Tahiti. Nothing of Incident occurred
during the long trip, fair weather being
encountered all the way. ?
There Is every likelihood that the City cf
Papeete and the Tropic Bird will be with
drawn from the South Sea trade, as thÂ«
French mails, which both vessels carried,
have been turned over to the Â¦ Ui'io.T
Steamship Company of New Zealand, and
mails from here will be carried by the
Oceanic Steamship Company. News from
the islands in the far Pacific will now be
scarce and far between. When the Tropic
Blid left Tahiti the bark Coldbear was
ln port.
Joe Humbel Missing.
The parents and the police are searching
everywhere for Joe Humbel. a resident of
Los Angeles.. Humbel lately returned on
one of the transports, on which he was
employed as a deckhand. On his arrival
In port he announced that he would leave
immediately for his home ln Los Angles.
Many days Â¦ have passed, and his parents
are very anxious to learn â¢ his where
abouts. Â¦Â¦â¢.Â¦/Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢
Had a Bad Fall.
George Dreamin while at work on the
transport Columbia yesterday fell Into the
hold and broke his arm and was also con
siderably bruised. His Injuries were at
tended to at the Harbor Hospital by Dr.
Thompson. Dreamln's escape from death
was miraculous. He fell a distance of
eighteen feet and struck on a quantity of
Iron stored ln the hold. ,
Rumor has It that the transport Mis
souri will not be used as a hospital ship
ln future, as too large a sum would,have
to be outlayed to place her In proper
shape, and' it is not considered that she is
worth the expenditure. It Is believed that
the steamer Badger, now at Mare Island,
will be substituted for the Missouri and
will be named Law ton, after the bra vÂ»
general who lost his life In the- Philippines.
Two well-known ships have been pur
chased by leading shipping men of Ham

Large Force of Paid Inspectors Will
Be Turned Loose in Chinatown
to Keep Away Bad *
Germs.
The odor of bad fish and decomposed
pork stood but a ghost of a chance in
Chinatown yesterday. Nothing but the
pungent fumes arising from chloride of
lime, 'that had been sprinkled in copious
quantities over the thoroughfares of the
Mongolian quarter, giving them the ap
pearance of Washoe Valley after a snow
storm, greeted the olfactory sense. of the
heathen, who has been afraid to die dur
ing the past few weeks lest the health.
officials would feed his carcass to the ani
mals in Kinyoun'smenageries, and who has
spent his time dodging the alleged germs
of the insidious bubonic plague.
The cause of the alteration in the scent
which has characterized the , Mongolian
territory for so many years was the al
leged discovery of suspected cases of bu
bonic plague, incidental to a "touch" on
the city treasury for additional funds,
which was successfully accomplished at a
dark lantern conference of city officials
held yesterday.
The doctors who have been Inspecting
Chinatown for somo time past are un
earthing corpses, whose mortal-ooils have
been ahuXtleU off for some time since.
They have been stowea away for burial
at a period when the autopsy surgeon's
knife is not so likely to penetrate their
yellow hides. The Chinese fear post mor
tem examinations, and they conceal the
bodies of their friends rather than apply
for a burial certificate. When the bodies
are found they are badly decomposed and
highly discolored, auch bodies are now
being autopsied by the health officials and
termed "suspicious cases'." Two cases
were reported Monday, and immediately
there was a little stir and the wires were
laid to "work" the city for an additional
appropriation, \esterday the work went
merrily on. Disiniectants were strewn on
the streets and more rubbish hauled to
smolder and annoy citizens on Pacific and
Dupont streets, and yesterday the appro
priatipn was agreed to.
The most "suspicious" case discovered
was that of Lew Sung Wong, who died on
Onedla place a couple of days ago. Of
ficers were immediately sent to place the
house under . quarantine restrictions and
an autopsy was performed. The Board
of Health fa!led to make the essential in
quiry in this case, which If they had
taken. the pains to do, might have set
their minds at ease and Drought less
alarm. The case under question was at
tended by two reputable city physicians
six days before death and both the-doc
tors are willing to give the cause of de
mise as natural causes. They are Drs.
Fitch and Atterberg of the Oriental Hos
pital, who, according to the Chinese Con
sul and managers of the hospital, say the
man had been sick for weeks.
As a result of a secret conference held
yesterday morning in the Mayor's office
one hundred men, acting as sanitary in
spectors, will be turned loose in China
town to make a thorough and rigid house
to-house investigation with a view to lo
cating any cases of suspected bubonic
plague that may exist there. There were
present at the conference Mayor Pholan.
Auditor Wells. Supervisors Jennings and
Hotaling of the Finance Committee, Dr.
Williamson, chairman of the Board of
Health; Health Officer O'Brien and Chief
of Police Sullivan.
Dr. Williamson made an urgent appeal
for more funds to conduct the sanitary
inspection of Chinatown- and stated that
his course had been impelled owing to
the fact that there was another suspicious
case of plague and further said:
I would suggest the employment of one hun
dred men to inspx-ct Chinatown. To this might
be added fifty jÂ»?llce otfioers, whom Chief Sul
livan could be requested to press into service.
I think that $7500 - would be sufficient for the
purpose. It would be advisable to erect a de
tention hospital within the limits of Chinatown,
where all suspected cases could be Isolated, and
the undertaking parlors should be all centered
In one locality.
Auditor Wells was of the opinion that
the money could be appropriated as a
matter of expediency and the Finance
Committee appearing to be convinced of
the reasonableness of the demand virtual
ly decided to recommend that an addi
tional sum be allowed the Health Board
to prosecute the work in Chinatown. This
will Include a wholesale disinfection of
the district, besides the ferreting out of all
suspicious deaths.
As an additional 'precaution two men
wllr be detailed by i the Board of Public
Works and one from the Health Depart
ment to erect screens ln the Chinatown
sewers, which sewers will be flushed and
all dead rats gathered up and burned, as
the rodents are carriers of the germs.
The Board of Public Works will be asked
to co-operate with the Health Board in
securing the men to act as sanitary in
spectors and a meeting, for that parpose
will probably be held to-lay.

"THE COST OF ADMIRALTY."
AS the days lengthen the death list from Manila
grows ionger. More Americans are sick and
dying there now than six months ago. The
transports come back laden with the dead. Instead
of argosies freighted with commerce, that tie to the
dock and hail the bustling stevedores, the hearse
ships make fast and the hundreds of coffined dead are
lined from the hold and hauled in a long procession
to the Presidio, whence they are sent afar by trains
steamers to their own for sepulture.
It is for them the end. Is it for the country the
beginning? I* the rainbow of oriental trade, arrayed
i:i ail its primary colors, worth all the misery that lies
siient in the thousands of coffins that have traversed
fourteen thousand miles of sea to bring home the
dead? Is that dream of greed worth the vacant-eyed
btare of the maniacs that come back with the dead?
A thousand pairs of handcuffs have gone to Ma
liila to manacle the lunatics whose brains have been
broiled of their wits by a vertical sun. The hearse
ships give up their dead and take on their return
cargo of coffins and handcuffs, for, every day the
tally of the dead and mad grows longer. The official
list for March 19 fills nearly a half column, in fine
type. Eighteen killed and wounded, and thrice
eighteen dead of typhoid, dysentery, beri-beri, small
j.-ox, malarial fevers and other burning pests of the
tropics, and the pitiless sun and poison rains moving
upon the camps with daily growing ardor.
We are asked to see compensation for it all and
forget the incoming cargoes of coffins filled and the
back freight of coffins empty in the victories which
attend our arms in far Luzon, where women fall de
fending their huts with pitiful wooden swords, -and
the country Â«s la;d black and waste and blear as the
crop of coffins it s*er.ds to us. Every battle is a vic
tory for us. and we slay fifty to one, but all the blood
we have spilled puts not one pulse back in the stark
wrists thr.t are quiet in their coffins. Will some one
post and print the gain set over against all this loss?
We have paid every assessment in death. When will
the dividend come? To put it on the sordid ground
of gain, wh'i are the profits expected?

THE SCAVENGER CART NUISANCE.
* FFORTS on the part of the police to abate the
scavenger cart nuisance resulted in the arrest of
* * one can-driver; that is to say, they were futile
md fruitless. There was more than one cart that
tiled to fulfill the requirements of the law, and
cither the police neglected to obey orders, or the
jrders were very indefinite and lax.
The municipal ordinance on the subject say*: "It
shz'ii be unlawful for any person, or persons, firm or
corporation, to use a cart or vehicle for the collection
and removal of general refuse, taken indiscriminately
;.s house refuse and composed of garbage, ashes and
dirt fro:n householders, stores and other places, and
transport the same along and upon the public streets
nnless the same shall be perfectly tight and with a
heavy cover, to Be approved by the Board of- Health,
tightly fastened on said cart or vehicle at all times
when the owner or driver of said cart or other vehicle
iÂ«. not collecting or depositing the general refuse, as
aforesaid, in said cart or vehicle."
Any person who chooses to give attention to the
retuse carts as they pass along the streets will per
ceive they have hardly even a pretenÂ«c of a cover.
The so-called covering is in most cases no more than
cloth, and is neither heavy nor tightly fastened to the
cp.n as the law requires. If the Board of Health have
criven its approval to such covers as these, it has
Ver-n seriously neglectful of its duty. If it have not
jriven approval, then it is still subject to a just charge
of negligence in not setting the police long ago to
the task of arresting the offenders against the ordir
nunce.
The passape through the principal streets of carts
filled with refuse and not securely covered -\% a
frreater menace to the health of the people than any
to-crJlcd "bubonic plague" the Board of Health may
conjure up out of the loathsome diseases of the in
hnbitants of Chinatown. From the uncovered carts
pestilential germs are liable at any time to be blown
about in the atmosphere of the streets thronped with
people. Moreover, even where there are no disease
jrerins. the dust and the odors of the carts constitut*
a nt:is;nre which should be suppressed. It is the
duty of the police to renew its efforts in that direc
tion, and to make them more vigorous than they
were yesterday.

GAGE AND THE PRESS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAJLi;, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21^ 1900.
Â¦ ... â . , .; â¢
NO ONE finds fault with Governor Gage's choice of a time and place to say what he
has to say in defense of his position and practices in California politics. That he
chose the banquet of the Young Men's Republican League at Los Angeles, and
his position as a guest thereat, is a matter of taste for which he alone is responsible.
His explanation of his own acts came in the form of an attack upon the news
papers which exposed those acts. The Governor forgot that he was paying court to
young Republicanism, and that it was no explanation of his personal defects- to loudly
damn the mirror which revealed them. If that were a remedy for physical and moral
blemish, all could become handsome and upright by the simple process of breaking all
the looking-glasses, and repealing all laws that deal with vice and frailty. ;
The Governor assumes that he was attacked and criticized for calling the extra ses^
sion. and thereupon lays about him with all the stallfed parts of speech at the Republican
newspapers, especially the morning papers of San Francisco and Los Angeles: But his
premise is wrong. No paper, that we are aware of, abused him for calling the extra ses
sion. The Call, especially, favored the extra session' and applauided warmly the conclu
sion of its labors in the election of Senator Bard. What has' put the.Governor under the
ban which chafes him is that he alone made the regular session a failure. He alone
brought the party info contempt and near to death by preventing at that* session the
election of a proper man to the Senate/ From the first he dragged his office into the
fight for Burns. There was not an hour from the first ballot to the last that an election
could not have been had if the Governor had confined himself to his legitimate executive
duties and let the Senatorial fight alone. The most unhappy incident of his intrusion
made that session a failure. He put theÃunis fight into everything that occurred in the
session. It was common talk that his veto and his signature to acts passed were con
trolled by the attitude of the authors of bills toward the interest of Burns. He per
mitted an abject devotion to the cause of an unfit and unworthy candidate to influence his
whole official conduct, from his appointments to his action on bills. . Yet after more
than sixty days' effort by all his influence to elect Burns, hej failed. , -
Â» Had this been all it need not have been a matter of great concern. But it was
not all. He had caused a disappointment in one of the great matters for which the Re
publican party had commissioned a Legislature. He had brought in sight a political re
verse in this State. He had alienated an independent, vote by disappointing it. He and
he alone had started that portentous reaction which routed the Republican party in this
city last November. No newspapers had done this. The evil was the result of the candi
dacy of Burns, which lived and moved and had its evil being in the favor of the Gov
ernor and not elsewhere. The press did not do this. The press deprecated it. The press
exposed even- day the filthy politics by which Burns sought to win, and denied party re
sponsibility for it. The press insisted that Burns could not dominate California Repub
licanism and ride it to the devil. The Governor insisted that Burns should mount ' and
ride, no matter what lay at the other end of the road. Had the Governor had his way he
could not have been congratulating the Young Men's Republican League of Los An
geles upon "the election of that stalwart Republican and able gentleman, Thomas R:
Bard, as United States Senator"; for the young men of the league would not have been
banqueting. Burns would have been Senator, and the young men would have been feel
ing about their party as a house does when one of its lady members elopes with a race
track gambler.
Republicans saw a possible retrieval by an extra session and demanded it. The
Call spoke early for it. An attempt was made to turn it to Burns' account, and that effort
failed through the watchfulness of the Republican press. The Governor remained to the
last steadfast for Burns, and would have perverted the extra session if he could. The Re T
publican press prevented it. He made the extra session necessary. The party press
All that is the plain truth of the matter, about which the Governor talked at the
banquet. He went into a fight on the wrong side, and got the worst hiding that has
ever fallen upon the back of a Governor. It ill becomes the dignity of his office to pro
long the exhibition of his stripes and use offensive language in describing the men who
used the "cat" on him. We beg to assure him that they will stand ready to do it again
and again as long as he attempts to do gutter puppolitics in the name of the Republi
can party. He is the party servant, not its master. If he wants to sit in the kitchen
with Dan Burns or keep company with touts, as a personal preference, all right. But he
can't bring them into the parlor, to offend his employer, the Republican party.
NATIONAL INCONSISTENCY.
SIR RICHARD HENN COLLINS, who was
one of the arbitrators in the international
tribunal before which the Venezuelan boundary
dispute was heard, has recently called attention to the
change which the development of events has brought
about in public sentiment among the people of the
United States and of Great Britain.
In order to establish the claims of Venezuela ex-
President Harrison and his associates warmly com
mended the manner in which the Spanish had founded
and built up their colonies. It was argued that the
beneficent character of Spanish colonization was such
that it was to be assumed the claims of the Vene
zuelans were just. The Spaniards, it was said, are 1
considerate people and would never have committed
an aggression or an unfair encroachment upon the
territory of their neighbors, the Dutch colony of
Guiana. On the other hand the British, who, as suc
cessors to the Dutch, were urging their claims against
Venezuela, maintained that the Dutch were the best
and noblest of colonizers, and that it was not pos-'
sible they could have claimed for themselves territory
which justly belonged to their Spanish neighbors. -
That was the way the argument was conducted over
the Venezuelan boundary, but now see what has hap
pened. The Americans, after asserting the bene
ficence of Spanish colonization, have swept it off the
map of the East and West Indies, and the British,
after vehemently asserting the excellence of Dutch
colonies, are now trying to eliminate them from South
Africa. ' .
This change in sentiment may be attributed to the
irony of fate or the whirligig of time, according, as
one views it seriously or humorously. With nation*
as with individuals, circumstances alter cases. We had
a great respect for Spanish colonization so long as it
was Great Britain that was attacking it, but when it
came our turn to take up the white man's burden the
case at once assumed a different aspect. So the Brit
ish were quite sure that all the Dutch colonists did
was quite right so long as the Dutch claims were di
rected against the Spanish, but when they stood in
the way of British expansion, then everything became
different.
The only strange feature of the affair is that the
change should have occurred so promptly and should
have happened to both the Americans and the British
at about the same time. There may be something of
fun in such a "shifting of ground on the part of two
grave and dignified nations, but it is safe to say that
neither the Spanish nor the Dutch perceive the humor
of it. " .
THE GERMAN MEAT BILL.
ONCE more the famous "meat bill" ; supported
by the Agrarians of- Germany has been
"shelved," and this time the shelving occurs
under circumstances that cause no little surprise.
That the measure would meet with strong opposition
in the Reichstag was foreknown, but when it passed
that body the almost universal belief was it had vir
tually become a law, since the Bundesrath is so much
under the control of the landed aristocracy that any
bill designed in their interests hardiy meets with even
a show of opposition there. â¢ ';"\
Reports from Berlin are to the effect that the shelv
ing of the bill is due to the personal, influence of the
Kaiser, who wishes to hold it back until the Reichstag
has voted on the naval programme. If the Agrarians
vote against the naval bill the Kaiser, it is said, will
see to it that the meat'bill is defeated. Thus we are
presented with a view of the august William posing
in the attitude of a political boss using one important
bill as a club with which to force members of a legis
lative body to vote for another. - ,'
, With the fate of the 4 meat bill we are almost as
much concerned as Germany. The object of it is to
shut: foreign meat out of the German market and
that will mean a heavy lossof-trade fo our meat-pro
ducing States. In view of the impending action in
Germany there is already a discussion in the Eastern
States as to what course we should pursue with re
spect to it. The trend of the discussion is in favor
of retaliation of one kind or another. It is said the
German bill will deprive our pork and beef packers
of a trade which amounts to $20,000,000 annually, and
we should by tariff measures shut an equal -amount of
German trade out of the United States..
The Germans now export j large quantities of wine
and beet sugar to the United States, and these are the;
products of the Agrarian landlords who are demand
ing the exclusion of American meats! lard and oleo
margarine from Germany. It would be, therefore,
something like poetic justice, as well as a good eco
nomic retaliation, for vs -to put a prohibitive duty on
such'imports from Germany. Perhaps theconscious
ness that some such action will be taken is one of the
reasons why the meat bill has been /shelved > in the
house of its friends. The landlords of the fiundes
rath are more renowned for ancient lineage and mili
tary swagger than for statesmanship, but they prob
ably know on which side of their bread the "butter is,
and that tariff-making is a game at 'which the United
States can play better and safer than any other nation
on earth. ' Â¦ Â¦

coasts and soon all the mainland on both
sides of the Aegean, as well as the islands,
had Joined in the general chorus of song.
. The three chief tribes all bore their part
In this lyric development, which lasted
some 250 years. But Athens, which was
to be the center of the golden age of
Greek literature, had, so far, taken a
relatively unimportant part in it. E^en
Sparta had shown during the seventh cen
tury a remarkable tendency to foster let
ters. This enlightened policy, so at vari
ance with her usual attitude, waa prob
ably encouraged by Delphi, and though
; not herself productive in literary lines
. Sparta became a great center of talent
from other Greek States. Tyrtaeus, Ter
pander. Thaletas. Alcman. Polymnestus
and others form a remarkable group of
poets and musicians, who must eventual
ly have revolutionized Sparta's attltu'de
toward letters if such enlightened patron
age had continued. But Sparta's attitude
changed completely, doubtless because the
authorities wished definitely to stamp out
a spirit so at variance with the funda
mental tenets of Spartan, discipline, which
taught that the citizen belonged to the
state, that obedience was his first duty,
to become a soldier the object and end of
his existence.
Sparta's renunciation of possible leader
ship in letters left the way clear for Ath
ens, which had been the slowest of all thÂ»
great Greek states to come forward and
play her role in literature. No rreat *ptc
poet had been an Athenian, and In Â«U1 th
lyrlc period only Solon had attained first
rank, and even he was far greater donbt-
Icpb as statesman and patron of letters
than as poet. But now her time bad
come. The expulsion of the tyrants In the
latter part of the sixth century, and more
especially the brilliant leadership of Ath
ens in repelling the Persian Invasions
early In the fifth century, turned all eyes
upon her. Tradition makes Identical the
birth year of Themistocles, the founder of
Athenian naval greatness, and of Aeschy
lus, the father of the Athenian drama.
Under the one Athens was to become tem
porary mistress of the seas; following the
lines marked out by the other she was to
win the hegemony, perhaps for all time.
In letters and art. "With the return of
peace and with enormously Increased
wealth and power and influence, AthÂ»n"*
set to work under wise leaders to makÂ«
herself the real capital of Greece. Wealthy
public men vied with the state In the en
couragement of art and letters. Not only
was native talent encouraged and reward
ed, but from all parts of the Hellenic
world men of gtnius were drawn to the
Attic capital by the stimulus which comes
from contact with the best minds, and by
the rich pecuniary rewards and still richer
compensation in fame , which fell to ex
ceptional merit. It was not that Athens
struck out new lines in literature. There
was nothing distinctly new to be .'done.
Her task was to'perfect in many lines the
beginnings that had already been mads.
If she might be said to have created any
new form it would perhaps be the drama;
but even here she- rather borrowed and
perfected what the Dorians had invented;
The unique thing was that whereas else
where Princes had patronized art and let
ters as in the case of PolycrateÂ«Â» of
Sam'os, the AlÂ»uadae of Thessaly, Hlero
in Sicily, and even at Athens- the Plsia
tratidae, now r whole people of Athens
became encouragers and promoters of
men of genius. It may be doubted If great
talent has ever anywhere else found ?o
stimulating an atmosphere as that of the
Athenian demoa in the fifth century B. C.
The first great literary achievement of
Athens was the drama. The rule still
held that poetry developed before prose.
The suitable medium for the other great
branches of literary composition was still
to be perfected, since history, philosophy
and oratory could not be adequately, ex
pressed except in prose. The lonian
r 'logographers." or . narrators In prose,
had made beginnings in history. , but
these were crude. Hecataeus of Miletus
and Hellanlcus of Mitylenewere clearly
as Inferior to Herodotus in their concep
tion-of history as in the style they com
manded.: The "father of history", belongs
entlrelv to the fifth century, and, though
from Halicarnassus. in Asia Minor, and
using the lonian dialect, owed much to
Athenian Influence. Atany rate, it was
Herodotus who ; fashioned history " into a
new i artistic ; form, and the , lonic dialect
which he used was doubtless not quite the

THE worthy gentlemen who have been appointed by Mayor Phelan to
choose a flag for San Francisco are expected shortly to make their
flnal selection of a design to be submitted to the Board of Supervisors
for adoption. It was thought that this foolish scheme would fall by
the weight of Its own absurdity, but the Mayor's Indorsement has
given It vitality and It has become serious rather than humorous to the peo
ple of San Francisco. The people of this city already have a flag, and they
want no other banner. They have a standard which represents their highest
and noblest ideals of national and social life. They have' a' flag which binds
them In a union with a great people. It is the flag which means more than
municipal or State life. It has a history and a dignity far surpassing any
other emblem in the minds of citizens.
It Is the flag of Washington and Lincoln. It is the banner which children
are taught to revere in their schoolhouses. It floats over every public build
ing in America and Is sacred -in 'every American home. It Is the flag of the
United States â the stars and stripesâ and It is the only flag that ought to ap
peal to American citizens. The Call offers It to Mayor Phelan as a design
for a flag for San Francisco. His Honor can go further and fare worse in
his selection. > -,
A few American cities have flags, but they shed no dignity upon the
municipalities they represent and they satisfy no need of city life. In some
cities they are objects of derision, as In Chicago, where the emblem of the
windy city is known as the "liver, and lard" flag. â¢ Perhaps Mayor Phelan
would like San Francisco to have the flag of the Phelan. hat. Flags are
needed to distinguish Individuals, tribes and nations. Banners serve no other
purpose. Xo one will say that San Francisco Is a nation, and the city has cer
tainly passed the tribal state. No one, except â¢ Mayor - Phelan perhaps, will
say that San Francisco Is an individual, and his Honor too frequently â¢ In
dulges a habit of introspection to make his judgment valuable.
For what reason, then, does San Francisco need a flag? The heads of gov
ernments, such as an Emperor, a King, a President or a Sultan, have per
sonal flags; but Mayor Phelan Is certainly none of these and can worry
along without a banner. Why not let us have the stars and stripes 'and
change the conditions of the contest? Let the Mayor advertise for sugges
tions for a municipal yell such. as. they have in colleges and universities.
We need a yell more than we do a flag. If the Supervisors, for example,
would open their sessions with an official yell great dignity and impressive
ness would be given to the proceedings. Other departments could do the same
and his Honor the Mayor could have a yell of his own. There Isn't the
slightest 'question: that he has .often felt the need of one, and much would '
be gained by giving It an official character. The Call suggests therefore that
a new competition be started.

Chris Jorgensen Cheerfully
Accepts Decision Relat
ing to Water Colors.
Stanton's Panel Entitled "Evening"
I Was Not Rejected by the Jury
of the Spring Exhibition of
the Art Association.
The San Francisco Art Association an
nounces with pleasure that the spring ex
hibition of works by California artists in
augurating the recently completed Mary
Frances Searles Art Gallery will open to
the public on Friday, March 23. The mem
bers of the association are Invited Â¦to a
prjvate view, and reception on. Thursday
evening. The number of pictures sub
mitted for acceptance greatly exceeded
the original estimate of the management.
When notice was sent. out mvltlng every
artist to submit ten samples of work the
management niust .have fancied .that
many of the painters would not respond
with more than one or two pictures each.
So many pictures, however, were sent "to
the institute* that 100 have been excluded
for-want of wall space. The Jury also
rejected 150 examples on thfe ground that
the work was not up to the! standard.
There is an obvious design in a certain
quarter to provoke dissension and trouble
among the artists and to Involve the Art
Association in an ugly squabble with the
painters. A paragraph In yesterday's Call,
wherein It was announced that Chris Jor
gensen had withdrawn : his water-colors,
was quickly, twisted around to , make It
appear to the public that Mr. Jorgensen
had been ! shabbily treated. The facts in
the case are exactly as -The Call stated.
Mr. Jorgensen ; was not aggrieved by the
decision of the committee. He made no
complaint to any one. He did. not solicit
an interview and > was not interviewed, as
reported. When he ascertained that a
ruling had been made that no water
colors would be exhibited in the main gal
lery .he courteously requested and was
given permission to withdraw his work.
He was disappointed, of course, that his
pictures | could not have the light which
the i new gallery afforded, but -he recog
nized the fairness of the ruling and made
no complaint and manifested no displeas
ure. 'Â¦"' Â¦ V' Â¦'" ' ' "â¢ Â¦Â¦ " * - Â¦Â¦
Some of the talebearers at the. institute
are spreading a rumor that a large panel
painted by John Stanton for the new jinks
room of the Bohemian Club ; was rejected
by the committee appointed to pass upon
the picture presented for the spring exhi
bition of the Art Association. It was Mr.
Stanton's original purpose to exhibit the
panel, entitled "Evening," at the institute,
and permission was obtained to withdraw
the picture from the club, but when the
demand for; space in the new gallery be
came so pressing Robert Howe Fletcher,
curator â¢ of " the â¢ Institute, advised Mr.
Stanton that the panel could not be placed
In proper light without excluding v other
pictures which Â¦ had been accepted. Mr.
Stanton thereupon- readily announced thaf
he ' would : not take the space . from other
exhibitors. By mistake and without ; the
knowledge of .Mr. Stanton the panel was
sent from the club to the Institute.' and as
It was not: placed In the new gallery the
venders of Kossip Immediately Jumped to
the surmise i that -the committee had
"turned-down Stanton.";
separate parts or limbs are, as it were,
disjointedâ as opposed to the periodic In
which the subordinate clauses are grouped
into more comprehensive periods of just
length and proportions. But hla Is the
perfection of a narrative style, and It was
a story of stories that Herodotus had to
tell. First of all, the general subject was
the most thrilling story of Greek an
tiquity, the attempt of the Eastern world
to overwhelm the Western, when Greek
liberty, political Institutions, literature
and art were all at stake. The proper
telling of this great story Involved a clear
exposition not only of what Greece was
and stood for, but of the -character and
motives of her assailant. And properly
to describe Persia it was necessary to
trace the previous history of that great
world power. And so Herodotus' narrative
became really a" history of the world as
the Greeks knew it, for the history of the
Persians led back into that of the Medes;
the contact of the Median empire with
Egypt made necessary a full account of
the country of the Nile; later Persian ex
peditions suggested an account of the
Scythians, as also of the Libyans, and
finally there followed necessarily the
story of lonian A.<ia Minor and the revolt
from Persia, which had prepared the way
for the conflict between Persia and
Greece. Herodotus was a great traveler,
and most of the world which he wrote of
he had himself visited. Those who a few
y_ears ago listened with eager ears to
btanley's account of the country and the
peoples in Africa can have some faint idea
of the interest with which the Greek
world received Herodotus' story of the
great countries beyond the seas. All the
world lovea new stories. Herodotus found
an endle.ss supply of such in connection
with the various peoples of whom he
wrote, and these stories he told in a fash
ion that no historian since has ever had
the art. to equaL And when he came to
tell of Marathon and Thermopylae, Sala
mis and Plataea, even the veterans of
those battles must have felt that the
narration was adequate. The whole re
mains perhaps the most Interesting his
tory in any literatuie.
The next great historian was an Athe
nian of the Athenians. Born about 471,
Thucydides was in his prime when tha
great conflict broke out between the two
foremost states of Greece. He was a pub
lic man of gTeat wealth, an aristocrat,
and connected with the family of the hero
of Marathon, had had the best training
that Athens at her greatest period couM
furnish. He belonged to the best circle*
at Athensâ doubtless to that of the jreat
Pericles himself. He had foreseen from
the beginning the significance of this great
struggle, and he spent twenty years in
collecting the material for its history. His
conception of history was in many re
spects different from that of Herodotus.
Perhaps he- had the other in mind when
he wrote: "Very likely the strictly his
torical character of my narrative may be
disappointing. But if he who desires to
have before his eyes a true picture of tha
events which have happened, ard of thÂ«
like event 3 which may be expected to hap
pen hereafter in the order Of human
things, shall pronounce what I have writ
ten to be useful, then I shall be satisi*ed.
My history .is an everlasting' possession,
not a prize composition which la heard
and forgotten." He regarded the great
struggle between Athens and Sparta,
which lasted twenty-seven years (Wl-KM),
"the greatest evtr known" down to that
time, and he considered It his duty not
simply to narrate the events of the war.
but- to set fortn the causes which led up
to these, and so he became the first philo
sophic historian. He died before his great
work was completed, leaving his account
broken off at 411 B. C; but even thus ajma
of the chief of succeeding historians have
pronounced him the greatest historian of
the world. TbÂ» Earl of Chatham, called
the work "the eternal manual of states
men," and directed that It should oe the
first book which hia son, William Pitt,
should read after entering the university.
Macaulay put the seventh book above
even the "De Corona" of Demosthenes,
as the "ne plus ultra of human composi
tion," and Pericles' great funeral oration
in book two may well be expected to kefcp
its rank as one of the greatest oratorical
compositions in all literature. One passaga
of this oration may properly be quoted
here as setting forth in the words of him
who did most to create the Athens of th.j
fifth century, the spirit that animated the
city and people of Athens at the acme of
the Attic period: "I say that Athens is tho
school of Hellas, and that the individual
Athenian in his own person seems to hava
the power of adapting himself to the most
varied forms of action with the utmost
versatility and grace. This Is no parsing
and idle word, but truth and fact; an.t tho
assertion is verified by the position to
which these qualities have raised thÂ«j
state. For In the hour of trial Athens
alone among her contemporaries la supe
rior to the repott of her. No enemy who
comes against her is indignant at tho re
verses which he sustains at tho hands of:
such a city; no subject complains that hta
masters are- unworthy of him. And wo
shall assuredly not be without witnesses;
there are mighty monuments of our power
which will make us the wonder' of this
and of succeeding ages. We shall not need
the praises of Homer or of any other
panegyrist whose poetry may please for
the moment, although his representation
of the facts will not bear the light of day.
For we have compelled every land and
everj- sea to open a path for our vnlor.
and have everywhere planted eternal me
morials of our friendship and of our en
mity."
Thucydldes* history was completed by
Xenopnon In his Hellenlca; but Xenophon.
however delightful his account of the ex
pedition of the ten thousand with Cyrus
the younger, and however interesting hla
semi-historical romance of Cyrus tha
elder, was no historian. He was a great
writer, but not the legitimate successor
of Herodotus and Thucydldes. The works
of later historians of this period, such as
Ephorus and Theoponipus, have been lost.
Far more than the beginnings of phll
osoohy had been made before the Attlo
period, especially among the lonian.-*.
Prose had been used by Pherecydes of
Svros, Anaxlmander and Anaximenes of
ililetus, Heracllrus of Ephesus and oth
ers but lonic prose was not yet an ade
quate vehicle for. philosophy. Xerwp napes
of Colophon, Parmenldes of Elea and Em
pedocles of Agrigentum chose verse as the
medium of their philosophy, but the true
form for philosophy is not verse, but
prose The great work vu to be dona
here, too. by the Athenians. The great
est Impulse was given to the study of
philosophy by Socrates, who was exactly
contemporary with Thucydides. But hÂ»
left notning In writing, and bis young dis
ciple, Plato, became the great exponent
of his doctrines. But this subject belongs
to a separate study, as does also the ac
count of Athenian oratory, which had m
the Qfth century perhaps Its greatest ret>
resentatlves In Pericles, who left nothing
In writing, and In Antlphon. from whom
fifteen speeches are extant.
To sum up, then: After the drama, ar
tistic prose was the great contribution of
the Attic period in the forma of literature.
The medium which it thuii created is per
haps still unexcelled, as found in the per
fected parts of Thucydldes. In the prin
cipal dialogues of Plato, In the chief
speeches of Demosthenes. The clearness
of perception and the native intellectual
vigor of the Athenians, as well as the nat
ural excellence of the Attic dialect, fitted
them especially for the highest attain
ments in prose literature. But as Greek
poetry had been essentially oral â that Is,
composed to be recited or sung rather
than read â so the excellencies of the best
prose literature were due In large meas
ure to the same cause.

THE GOLDEN AGE OF GRECIAN LITERATURE.
GOLDEN AGES' OF* LITERATURE.
X. THE ATTIC PERIOD.
BT CHARLES FORSTER SMITH. PH. D.
The great creative "period of epic poetry
was practically closed about 800 B. C.
With the development of' individuality
new forms of poetry were required. Out
of -the epic hexameter Greek genius
created in the elegy an instrument not
simply for lament, but which might ex
press philosophic and sententious
thoughts, even political wisdom. .Elegiac
poetry used the dialect and vocabulary of
the epic in the main, and changed the out
ward form only by shortening every other
line into a practical pentameter. The next
step was a greater one. lambic verse
was fashioned Into an Instrument of
satire, and as the verse departed more
from the traditional forms so the vocabu
lary became mpre like that of everyday
life. The new- form was doubtless of
more or less slow growth, but the first
great genius to appropriate it is reputed
its founder, and the Greeks, grateful for
this new literary achievement, hailed
Archilochus as a benefactor second -only
to Homer. But there were other Intimate
and powerful feelings of the heart and
soul still seeking literary expression, and
the 'Aeolians of the island of I,esbos
created melic, or song proper, in various
meters. Passion in all its manifestations,
but especially love, was its burden, and
Alcaeus, Sappho and Anacreon became
its chief representatives.
So far two of the great branches of the
Greek race had been chiefly active in the
development of poetryâ the lonians in
epic, elegiac and iambic poetry, the
Aeolians in lyric proper. The Dorians,
too, were developing a form of lyric suit
ed especially to the worship of the gods
and to the celebration of athletic victories.
These lyrics were to be sung not by in
dividuals, but by carefully trained choirs,
either in procession or with a dance ac
companiment. Of this Dorian choral
lyric, Stesichorus and Arion in earlier
times, Simonldes and Pindar In later, were
the chief representatives. This growth
of the new forms of poetry had been co
incident with the era of colonization in
Greece. ; In the eighth century B. C. the-

Purses came pretty easy for Corrlgan at
Tanforan Park yesterday, his Chimura,
Afghan and Joe McGee scoring at very
remunerative odds. The first named
mare, a favorite for the mile and a quar
ter run, won under most fortunate cir
cumstances. Henry managed to get him
self pocketed behind Gotobed, Red Pirate
and Lothian in the stretch, with his posi
tion looking hopeless. Pulling out, he
went around the trio and. on pounds the
best horse. Won out at the last jump from
Gotobed.
After the entries had closed on Monday
through somebody's carelessness it waj
discovered that Afghan "was not in." He
was added, and the chestnut's victory
could also be termed timely, if not lucky.
Three choices were laid 'away, while
three others met with more success. The
attendance was very light. Henry again
rode a brace of winners, Piggott right at
his heels with a like number to his credit.
Ab Stemler's Eon filly Eonlc defeated
her company in decisive fashion "in the
two-year-old scramble. Going to the pest
a 2 to 1 choice, with Piggott up, she led
almost from the start, winning hands
down. In a hard drive Merida led Princess
Leota out a head for place.
A big bunch of twelve started In the
six-furlong sprint following. Mr. Johnson,
a strong tip, opened favorite, receding
later in the betting to 9 to 2, while Sor
row closed favorite. Shaw on Rosalbra, a
7 to 1 shot, managed to show llrst soon
after the start and was never headed,
beating Monda and Sorrow, the favorite,
out in a hard drive. Mr. Johnson ran a
close fourth.
About the. only starter in the fourth
number that received any backing was
Corrigan's Afghan, which was piayed
down from 4 to 13 to 5. Mocorlto opened
favorite, but warmed up so lame that her
price went to 13 to 5. Piggott on -Afghan
ehot to the front and, never headed, was
first at the wire by a length. In a "Irtve
Glover astride High Hoe landed his mount
in the place half a length before Casdale.
Scotch Plaid, a 6 to 5 choice, experienced
no difficulty in taking the mile and a six

PERHAPS THIS FLAG

The Gall Offers Another Design for
a Municipal Banner.New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 20.â There was a bril
liant display of speculative pyrotechnics to
day which was Interesting and informing as
a spectacle, but which must have been at
tended with unpleasant consequfnees for some
one. The speculative outbreak took place in
the New York traction group and was pre
cipitated by the oScial announcement pub
lished this morning that the Metropolitan
Street Railway had secured a controlling In
terest in the Third Avenue Railroad. This at
once confirmed the fears of shorts, which have
been quite acutely manifested for several days,
that there was not a large enough supply of
Third Avenue stock on the market to enable
them to cover their unfilled contracts for de
livery. In other words, the stock was cor
nered. Tha result, briefly etated. was a Jump
of nearly 17 points in the price on top of yes
terday's rise of nearly IS points. The violent
rise in the stock brought out large lots from
holders, wbicb caused many relapses and made
wide and feverish fluctuations all day. But
when the ehorta attempted to cupply their
needs the price always mounted buoyantly
upward again. The New York public utilities
have been the favorite field of operation by
the bears for several days part and the sym
pathetic Htrensth imparted to the group by
the Metropolitan-Third Avenue combination
drove the shorts to cover with a rush. The
extreme advanoes in the group were: Metro
politan. 11%; Brooklyn Transit, 7%; Consoli
dated Gas, 7; Brooklyn Union, a, and Man
hattan, 4iÂ». The possibilities of economy of
operation and elimination of destructive rival
ries as a result of the combination undoubtedly
improves the Ftatus of the Metropolitan and
Third Avenue properties, but the price move
ment of tha day wfis almost wholly dua to
speculative exigencies. Third Avenue stock
commacded as high as 4 per cent premium for
use on loans. There was furious manipulation
In the stock all day as was evidenced by the
clmultaneous sales on regular transactions and
un sellers flzty-day contracts at nearly 10
points apart, the regular sale commanding the
fcigh price. Other Â«tocks in which the short
lr.terest had been largely reflected by the
urgent demand from the shorts, notably Sugar,
AmeriTcn and Continental Tobacco, People's
Gas aiil Wf*iern Union, which rose 1% to 3>i.
EpeculÂ»Uon in the railroad list was rather dull
during the period of feverish excitement in the
ttpecialties. but later In the day an active and
\Â°igorous demaxd sprang up for Baltimore and
Ohio, the Pacifies, rome of the Grangers,
Wheeling and Lake Erie second preferred and
a r.'jmUr of less prominent stocks. Baltimore
and Ohio was earned up 4>4 points. The blgh
<*i prices were not maintained in any cane,
the violently epeculatfve epeclaltles showing
the sharpest reactions, but the closing gen
erally was rather easy below the best and
the net changes, though mostly gains, were
very ragged as to uniformity. The Iron and
rteel etocks were rather heavy, notably Na
tional at eel and Tennessee Coal. The money
market showed evidences of relaxation. The
continued decline in price of Government bonds
Indicated a procese of liquidation 'which sug
?evla that the recent level of prices prompted
the changing of plans for taking out bank
note circulation acd the Belling out of hold
ir.c-n of bonds.
The railroad bond market continued active,

NEW YORK. March 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram, says:
There was considerable Increase In . the busi
ness In the markets here, although It was
mainly professional. Still, the public Is thought
to be waking up at last. The general , tone was
good. Consols were up on one closing of Dig
bear commitments and Paris buying. The war
loan sold at 2 3-16 premium and 4 per cant is
talked of. . - Â¦ . .
American were good all day. although not
brink. London bought Baltimore and Ohio and
Union Pacific, while New York supported the
rise which the Morgan stocks started.
Paris keeps Tlntos firm, but New Yory allows
Anacondas to droop. The ban? bought Â£62.000
gold in bars and lost Â£10,000 for an unstated
Washington call.
Money was easier. Less than half the amount
due the bank was repaid, but money was more
plentiful.

CHICAGO, March 20.â Early trading In wheat
was marked by considerable liquidation. Cables
were lower at the opening and continued to
decline, which, â¢ with the continued large re
ceipts in the Northwest and the absence of
foreign demand, left the market practically
without support. May opened unchanged at
C6%@66>4c. Pressure to liquidate, which soon
became quite general, forced the price back
to 66Vic. Below this point, however, the bears
could not force the market and shortly before
11 o'clock a good demand sprang up, local
shorts and outsiders giving support to the mar
ket and advancing the price to 66% c. This
demand satisfied the market again relapsed
into a condition of heaviness with the price
fluctuating within a narrow range. During the
last hour of trading strength again developed.
The visible decreased 1,328,000 bushels, which
was more than expected. This stiffened the
market appreciably and when the seaboard
reported an Improved foreign demand the mar
ket became quite brisk. May reaching the
best point of the day. 66% c, at which, price
the market closed eteady.
Corn was dull and inclined to weakness,
prices ruling a little lower. News was such
as not to materially Influence prices and the
market was controlled by scalpers. May closed
Â»ie lower.
Oats showed no indications of recovering
from Its present stagnation. Speculative busi
ness was Insignificant. May closed a shade
lower.
Provisions were active, the market at times
being In a semi-panicky condition so far as
pork was concerned and the price of that
commodity covered a wide range. Small stocks
of pork, the continued advance in the price of
hops and fear that a corner might be at
tempted brought about a strong buying move
ment shortly after the opening and as the
price went skyward shorts tumbled over them
selves In their eagerness to cover. The price
advanced 50c In a very few minutes. Their
offerings became liberal and the market fell
a great deal faster than it had advanced, 1 20 c
being clipped off quickly. Another flurry
chopped off 30c more, but before the close con
fidence had been restored and the price again
advanced to about yesterday's closing figures.
Late in the session there was ' considerable
selling put on lard and ribs and those com
modities suffered in consequence, pork also
weakening somewhat. The close was rather
nervous with May pork 2%c lower, May lard
7%c lower and May ribs 7V4c lower.

Quit Drug Coffee and Uses Postum
Cereal Coffee.
"While on a visit to a relative in New
Hampshire, who runs a fruit farm, I
found on the supper table what appeared
to be a strong cup of coffee. I usually
drank tea at night and they knew it, but
asked me to try the coffee, saying it was
Postu:n Food Coffee, and the reason
they served it was that they found when
they got up early in the summer morn-
ings and drank a cup of coffee to brace
up on they generally had a headache or
tick stomach along about noon, and that
their grocer persuaded them some time
before my visit to try Postum Food
Coffee. After a week's trial they adopt-
ed' it for the family, and had never re-
turned to the ordinary coffee, saying
that it had worked a wonderful change
in all of them â no more sick headaches,
no more sick stomachs.
"For two weeks I used Postum, and
when I returned to Boston I banished
tea and coffee from the table forever.
My complexion has made a decided
change for the better, and it poes with-
out saying that I feel greatly benefited.
My njghts are not sleepless now, as they
were when I was a coffee drinker.

BATCH OF MURDERERS
ARRESTED BY POLICE
Detective Gibson,' With Sergeant and
'Squad, Pick TJp Bad Highbind
ers in Chinatown.
Detective Gibson, in company with Ser
geant Patrick Mahoney and the high
binder sQuad, made one of the best round
ups of Chinese murderers which has been
made In this city for some time. Four
men, who will be tried each on several
charges of murder, a highbinder with a
gun and several more who will be booked
later for capital offenses was ' yesterday's
record. . - Â¦ /
The officers recently gained information
that a number of Suey Sing hatchetmen
were about to return to this city .to com
mence operations. They set a trap for
them and last night the following were
arrested: Lou Fook, wanted for a murder
in the Jackson street theater; Sue Ho
Mon. wanted for the killing of three men;
Ho Mun. wanted for the recent murder
of Wong Yuen on Waverley place, and
Jung Sing, supposed to have- been Impli
cated in a killing In a theater. In addition
to these captures Chung I Sing and Gon
Soom, notorious highbinders, on whose
heads crime may be fixed later, were also
taken.
All the men belong to the Suey Sing
Tong and : this society will be badly
crippled as the arrests mean the taking
away of some Â¦of its . choicest lawless
talent. Witnesses have promised the po
lice to assist in the ' prosecution of the
men and the hired assassins may yet get
their just deserts.
The highbinder war is still far from a
settlement and the merchants speak hope
lessly of bringing about an amicable ad
justment until more lives have been,sac
rificed. That the taking of blood is still
In vogue Is â¢ evinced by > the fact ' that

DAMROSCH LEADS
THE ORCHESTRA
ANEW leaf was added to the musi
cal history of , San Francisco yes
terday afternoon by the concert un
der the leadership of Mr. Walter
Damrosch, which took place at the Grand
Opera-house. The audience. In spite of
the Lenten season, was the largest that
has ever attended such an ' affair in this
city, and it was as generous in applause
as it was In numbers.
The elements of attraction were mani
fold. We were to hearMme. Gadskl and
Mr. Blspham again; ther* was the prom
ise of selections from Wagner's operas,
with competent orchestral accompani
ment; and an instrumental programme of
more than ordinary Interest; but the
most potent factor in drawing the people
was, without doubt, the fact that Mr.
Damroech, whose personality has capti
vated every one, was to conduct, and the
faith that there waa in his ability was,
fully confirmed. Â¦Â¦..â¢'
Mr. Damrosch is not an absolutely com
pelling force as a leader of orchestra; he
Is not so much the titan as the wizard;
he does not command respect, yet wins it.
Despite meager rehearsing he succeeded
in puting his band In good shape and his
work must be considered a creditable
achievement. The orchestral numbers
were given with cleanness and precision,
strength and an abundant infusion of
spirit; above all â¢ there was rhythm and
flow, which speaks not only for a native
quality In the conductor, but for his quite
remarkable faculty for training his men
to his own sense of the requirements. '
The Tannhauser overture and the Vor- :
eplel of Lohengrin were given readings
such as they have never had in San Fran
cisco. It is not for every leader to attain
to the true Wagnerian 6plrlt and those
who have shown the greatest powers in
the treatment of other composers have
frequently fallen short in their Interpre
tation of Wagner.
Mr. Damrosch showed his mastery par
ticularly in these items through the two
movements of Beethoven's Fifth Sympho
ny, the fourteenth Liszt Rhapsodic and
Tschaiskowsky's "Marche Slave," in
which he was not merely satisfying, but
brilliant. The orchestral element of the
programme was rich with color and ef
fectiveness and the admirable security
and delicious rhythm which the band bor
rowed from the clever conductor will not
soon be forgotten.
Mme. Gadski's singing: of Weber's
"Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster," was pos
itively inspiring and when she sang for
encore "The Valkyrie's Cry" she gained
applause such as one seldom hears. Mr.
Bispham was at his best in excerpts from
"Tannhauser," a song -by Brahms, Schu
bert's "Serenade" and the Widmung of
Schumann. Mr. Damrosch's ! accompani
ments of the last two items were most
musicianly. The impression that Mr. Bls
pham has made was attested by a suc
cession of recalls, which were as sincere
as they were vociferous and well, de
served.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the com
mittee who had the recent symphony sea
son in charge and through /vhose Instru
mentality this concert waa arranged and
If our last hearing of these delightful ar
tists was a pleasure we take leave of
them with the keenest regret. They have
done much for the uplifting of musical
taste in San Francisco and it is to be
hoped they have paved the way for a
future visitation.

Savannah's Eeception in His Honor
) Delayed Because of an Attack .
of Indigestion.
SAVANNAH, Ga., March 20.â The pro
gramme for . the entertainment of Ad
miral and Mrs. . Dewey was broken this
morning by the illness of the admiral. A
public reception had been -arranged for
the hours between J> and 11 o'clock and
5000 persons gathered at the De Soto Ho
tel to greet the distinguished visitors.
But the admiral' was too ill to appear and
thus the function had to be called off.
The admiral's attack, which is of indi
gestion, occurred- on board the revenue
cutter Hamilton while the party was on
a trip down the river and harbor. Sur
geon General -Wyman of the Marine Hos
pital service and Dr. St. J.- B. Graham,
Who "were aboard the cutter, administered
to the; admiral, but his indisposition was
so severÂ© that it was deemed best to bring
him back to the city. The admiral is rest
ing easily to-night and his physicians say
he will no doubt be able to go on with the
programme of arrangements to-morrow.
All the shipping in the harbor, foreign
and domestic, was decorated gayly in
honor of ' the admiral. Mrs. Dewey â¢ was
entertained this afternoon by a committee
of ladies at the yacht club, where she
heard . plantation songs by a chorus of

tion from the Merchants' Association of
San Francisco relative to the purchase of
supplies for the army in the Philippines.
The ; Government has been buying large
quantities of goods In Hongkong and
Manila. Formerly : such goods were
bought duty paid In San Francisco, but
now the Government . makes Â¦an apparent
saving by purchasing In -bond in the Ori
ent. Commissary General Weston assured
Mr. Kahn that goods bought in Hongkong
and Manila; were chiefly, fresh beef and
rice and t that San Francisco merchants
would have equal opportunity: with others
to bid on Government contracts for sup
plies. This is what the merchants desire.
They believe goods can be bought aa
cheaply in bond In San Francisco as in

Pachmeyer was formerly a dishwasher for H. Otersen, a

relative of Froebel, the Swiss who instituted the kindergarten

SUBSIDY BILL WILL
BENEFIT PACIFIC COAST
Special Dtayatcb to The OUL
. TACOMA, March 20.â Hugh C. Wallace,
president of the Washington and Alaska
Steamship Company, has returned from a
four months' trip to England and Wash
ington, Â£>. C. It is understood that his
time while away was devoted largely to
negotiations looking toward the organiza
tion of another and larger steamship com
pany, which will absorb the business of
the Northern Pacific Steamship Com
pany and North American Mall
Steamship Company, now operating
out of this port. Mr. Wallace
devoted his energies while at Washington
to the Interests of the latest ship subsidy
. bill, which, as now agreed upon. Is ex
pected to pass Congress very soon. Thia
bill will appropriate J20.000.000 for ship
subsidies on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. Atlantic coast shipping interests
endeavored to so arrange matters that the
entire, amount would be expended on ser
vices out of Atlantic ports. To combat
this proposition the interests of thÂ© Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company. Northern
Pacific Steamship Company and Great
Northern Railway were united in their
defense. The result of their efforts vas
to secure an arrangement whereby 30 per
cent of the total amount, or J0.000.000 an
nually, shall be devoted to Pacific Coast
commerce-It will follow that this amount
will be divided somewhat in proportion to
the number of their steamships between
thÂ© three Pacific Coast companies named.
The bill also provides that British steam
era can participate in subsidy benefits
providing the company operating them
guarantees to expend a certain amount

When the first brood came from the Incubator Pachmeyer
sprinkled "the floor with grreen sawdust to imitate grass and
inserted therein pieces of mirror glass, which might be mis
taken by the innocent fowl for ponds ' of â¢ water. ' Around the
walls' were tacked sprigs of green, which were -secured from
the small boy in the flower store below, that the place- might
don a sylvan appearance. â¢
"I will lot these ducks pick at the sawdust and mirrors for
a while," quoth the master of the school, "then I will bring
them to genuine grass and water. In this manner they will be
taught -to distinguish between the genuine and the bogus."

advantage of his confidential relations

around and commence proceedings against
his former clients.

allowed to take advantage of that breach
of confidential relations between Guy C.

KINDERGARTEN AND NURSERY
FOR DUCKS NOW ABOLISHED
OAKLAND, March M.-Wll!!am S. Good
fellow, representing the trustees of the es
tats of the late Thomas Vamey. yesterday
mAOc a charge in open court before Judge
< ijrden that former State Senator Guy C.
Bui. a member of the law firm of Bishop
<w Wheeler was guilty of having committed
a breach of confidential relations with
clients, which. Goodfellow held, should
preclude the Pan Francisco firm of law
: era from appearing for the plaintiffs in
the euit Instituted by divers heirs of the
late Thomas Varney against the trustees
cf decedent's c-Etata. who are accused of
mismanagement and misappropriation Of
Â£ large portion of the pioneer's fortune.
Goodfellow's Charges.
Attorney William S. Goodfellow, repre
f^nting the trustees, made the accusations
against Attorney Earl and presfhttd a
motion that BiÂ«hop & Wheeler, A. X. Treat
and A. A. Xix, who are Â«Uso connected
â¢with the firm, be excluded from taking
part in the case en behalf of the 1-eirs.
}lis motion was based upon the charge
that the Information upon which the suit
was brought was obtained by Senator
Earl from the trustees while he was the
attorney for two of them during n. suit
hrought some time ago. His former clients
are now compelled to defend charges
Â¦which ere being prosecuted through civil
action by the firm of which he is a mem
ber.
Attorney Treat, who with Mr. Rlx ap
peared for the heirs, strenuously denied
That Senator Earl had furnished any In
formation about the litigation. Treat
euiVe that the case bad been placed in
hi* h&nds before the Gnn of Bishop &,
"Whseler had "been formed, and that he
had individually collected tne tnfqrm&tion
upon which the suit against the trustees
vu brought.
The suit was filed in February of last
year. Mr. Goodfellow 2emaad.ll to know
why so much delay had been permitted if,
ts Attorney Treat said, the case had been
IB his hands for several years before that.
Treat replied that he had gone to Bishop
& Wheeler because the case Involved
heavy law points, and the firm had
teen too busy with other matters to take
v:p the Veraey affair.
Threats of Disbarment.
Attorney Goodfellow flatly declared be
fore the court that lawyers had been dis
barred for conduct which was not nail
tt bad as that of which he now com
plained. He asserted that, while holding
ro animosity toward Senator Earl, ho
was impelled to this action as * matter
of duty toward hie clients.
The point of contention is whether cer
tain documents and information furnished
to Senator Earl as attorney for the trus
tees Â«at not turned over to the firm or
Bishop & Wheeler for use against the
truttfrecs in the present litigation.
Incidtsrtallv t?uvâ¬rior Judge Samuel P.
Hall was dragged into the sensational
proceedings, but in a way whlchin no wi^e
involved him in the charges against EarL
The trouble besen to-day as soon as
Judge Og3en had called the case of Var
r.ev against Varney for trial. This Is a
Fuit of Frank Varney and other heirs of
the late Thomas Varney against Thomas
H. B. Varr.ey, H. H- Pitcher and John
Taylor, trustees, for' an accounting, and
reciting marry charges ngainn the trio.
Cause of the Trouble,

making many bequests axid tying- up a
large portion in trust for various pur
*' Thi- estate )i&s b*Â«i in probatp ten
years Attorney Goodfe-Ilow has handled
the trustees' legal affairs. Hall & Earl
were law partners when Judge Ellsworth,
thrte or four years ago. ordered five of
thÂ« trustees to bring a euit against
Thomas FL B. Varneyâ the third oneâ to
recover ?Â£.<.<XÂ» he owed the estate. Lpoii
Attorney GoodfelloWs request Judge Ells
worth consented to select an attorney for
the two trustees and then Attorney Hall,
partner of Senator Earl, was selected.
Buit vu brought by Hall & Earl.
Judpe Hall was called to testify to-day
as to his status in that litigation and he
*xpl*ix:e4 that while acting as attorney
for Tranws Taylor and Pitcher he had
become a Judge and left the case with the
nther business of the firm In Earl's hands.
Judjre Hall paid he had received a lot of
<jaia an<l documents from Attorney Good
f p'.low &!>out the estate and he thought he
had arrrised Earl of all the facts in the
case with which he was familiar.
Attorney Treat Testifies.
Then Attorney Treat was called.
"Was not Mr. Earl a member of the
f.na nf Bishop & Wheeler at the time you
f.rst Tyoame connected with this estate
cf YaraÂ»v?" queried Attorney Goodfellow.
"I don't think he was. I will not be
"How can you find out and testify to
it'"'
"Well, I purP'**. by inquiry."
Then Goodfellow made an .elaborate
Ftatement to the court. In which he said*.
"When Thomas Varney died he waj?
liable to the Bather Banking Company on
a guarantee given for his nephew, Thom
as H. B. Varney, the trustee. I^ater the
irustÂ«wsj>. who were al.Â«o executors, paid
the $23,000 and there was a complication,
which Judge Ellsworth settled by direct-
Ing suit. I insisted that he should have
peiectJon of an attorney, and he selected
F P Hall. Varney went to Mr. McEner
r.ey. who has nothing to do with me. We
ore not and never have beÂ«Â»n partners,
tJmngh we have offices together.
"Since that cult has been pending Judge
Hall went on the bench and turned over
all the pa.peri> to Guy C Earl. Among the
papers *ri> the pro<-**ed!ngiÂ« had in this
pun b*>for<Â» Judge Ellcworth. The testi
mony wm taken upon the settlement of
the account. Involving all the facts upon
â¢which this present proceeding is based."
Nature of the Proceeding.
The Courtâ What is this proceeding?
I "It is to have certain trusts declared in
valid or construed in some particular way
by these people will get the money
which is nn the hands of these trustees;
&lso to charge Pitcher and Taylor per
sonally with a lanre sum of money."
"The 53,000?" asked Judge Ogden.
"S*o, eir. By reason of their manage
ment, by reason of matters disclosed upon
the face of the papers that were handed
to B. D . Hall."
"Those papers are matter of public
record." Interrupted Attorney Rix.

INDEPENDENCE
Secretary of State Root's
Observations on the
Islands. '
WASHINGTON, March 20.â Secretary
Root this afternoon gave to President Mc-
Kinley the results of his observations of
affairs in Cuba during his recent trip to
the island. Subsequently the Secretary
consented to talk for publication as to ex
isting conditions in the island and the pos
sibilities of the people in the direction of?
self-government.
The Secretary expressed himself as Â«at-
Isheu on the whole with what he saw.
Naturally the question of the ultimate in
dcr>Â«rdence of the island came up for dis
cussion during the Secretary's visU to
Cuba, but he was not prepared to say
Just when the United States Government
would be willing that this should b-Â» a
reality.
Incidental to this matter, which is up
permost in the Cuban mind, are the steps
that will bring it about. The first of these,
viz., the holding of the municipal elections
at an early date, was a subject that Sec
retary Hoot discussed freely, particularly
with the United States officials on the ls
and.
"These elections." said the Secretary,
"will be the Cubans' first effort toward
popular government. Unaccustomed as
they are to these things, they are aa th<Â»
b.ihe unborn and have everything to
learn. The whole plan for making effect
ive the scheme of municipal suffrage has)
been very carefully worked out and the.
people instructed in alt the details. This
involves a vast amount of labor and takes
considerable- time, but ultimately the plan
will be worked out and the elections held.
I hardly believe, however, that the author
ities will be- quite ready for holding the
elections by the Ist of May.

" Edward Fitzgerald, a coal-passer, resid

GENERAL SHAFTER WILL
PRESENT THE CANNON
Ceremonies in Front of the City Hall
at Noon To-Day, When the Old
Gun Will Be Put on Guard.
To-day at 12:30 o'clock General Shatter
will present to Mayor Phelan, as repre
senting the city, the old twenty-four
liounder that was captured at Santiago.
The ceremonies will not be elaborate, but
their military dignity will be enhanced by
the attendance of General Shafter's staff
Jn full ares*, two troops of the Sixth Cav
ulry and Ihe band of the Third Arjlllery.
General Shatter will make the presen
tation adcress: and Mayor Pholan will ac
cept the gun. It will be mounted in front
of the group of statuary on the Market
etreet side.
The gun is a curiosity ln more ways
than one. Its inscriptions show it to be
of high and ancient lineage, made by
the best founder of its time and a cannon
used to good company and plenty of ac
tive service. Its grim old chase is in
scribed with the words "Le Prince de
Conde" and then the significant motto,
"Ultima Ratio Regnum" ("The Last Ar
gument of Kings"). This was originally a
Spanish motto, which form, "Ultima.
Kazon de Reyes," was used frequently on
the Spanish ordnance. Louis XIV of
France saw the beauty of the sentiment
and ha ordered it, rendered into Latin, to
be inscribed on all the French guns of that
period. " "
Farther down on the chase are several
names, perhaps of the commanders under
whom the old gun tought, perhaps of sol
diers whose deeds were gallant enough to
warrant their names being preserved on
the old bronze warrior. The names are:
Louis Charles de Bourbon, Comte d'Eu
and Due d'Aumale. It is certain, how
t-vcr, that they have no connection with
the name of the gun. for by its position
Oor.de's name seems to have that honor.
Ar.d tbe last of all comes another motto,
"No Pluribus Impair" ("No unequal an
tagonist tor many"), which well reflects
the ppirit cast in the metal of the cannon.
It was a big: piece of ordnance in its day,
although now it would have to give the
â¢wall to a one-pounder.
DULL, stale and flat", was the Fair
case yesterday. morning and the lit
tle there was in the afternoon was
of the .same tone. Yet- the day
did not ; pass without' its sur
prise. When court, attorneys and report
ers were preparing, to settle in their. Beats
for the long two and a half hours of
the afternoon session, to the astonishment
of all McEnerney asked that the- case
go over until Monday morning,. April 2.*
Long and eloquently did that attorney
talk, but he -might have spared ' himself
the labor, for n6t only were the. attorneys
on both sides of a mind, but Judge Troutt
also thought that a' continuance would
be advisable. The petitioners '..have now
finished their case. When .Mrs?; Crayen-
Fair is put upon the stand c a'Week from
Monday ehe will be cross-exaiftihed in' re
gard to statements concerning the deeds.
After that McEnerney, Piersdn, Heggerty,
Wheeler et al. will have their. fling, and
the work of rebuttal will begin.. -
The trial opened yesterday morning with
Clerk Janes of the Windsor Hotel in the
witness chair. All he was asked to do
was to identify a small pile of moth-eaten
books which contain the accounts 6t Mrs.
Gllleran during the year 1822 when Fair
made a Mecca of the hotel, the shi-lne at
which he worshiped being Mrs. Craven,
according to allegation. .
Mrs. Gilleran mounted the stand with
alacrity of body and the same frlskiness

of . spirit ' she displayed at her first en
counter with McKnerney. /. Clad in warm
colored velvet and with new and stunning
head gear, she looked thirsty for a fray,
but it came' not: -McEnerney's cross-ex
amination was very -brief. With all* the
hotel business literature in hand McEner
ney began 1 his cross-questioning.
Â¦ "Mrs. Gillerah, 1 does. the item $57 75 en
tered August 11, 1892, purporting to be a
receipt for the amount of Mrs. Â¦ Craven's
bill mean, in full?" SÂ»
.-â¢'Yes, it does," was the ready response.
"Fifty dollars was f or Â¦ board and lodg
ing,.the $7 75. for extras.", The extras were
mostly bottles of beer, with an 'occasional
cocktail,- as the 'â¢ redirect examination
brought out. â¢' - Â¦?Â¦.,.Â« v : -
; Oh redirect examination Lafe Pence was
equally, brief. "When .; Mrs. Craven left
;dfd she pay ] the account ! in full?'.' 1 said
Pence, i <;Â¦,:Â¦ ' â¢ .
'-"I think so; but she' was a little. short,
and she asked me' for a loan," responded
Mrs. Gilleran.
â¢."Did 'she repay : it?"""" *-Â¦.--
: "Yes, when she '.opened -.the package at
the t California- Hbtel." Â¦
: Mr. McEnerney Qbjected r to this answer
going into the evidence, claiming that
Mrs. Gilleran testified pn Thursday last
that the money given her at the Califor
nia Hotel wa? in payment of, a board bill.
Much argument ensued, and Mrs. Gilleran
cut off the attdrneys by .asseverating that
Mrs. Craven had borrowed $15 from her
and -that -it- was -returned the time she
called upon Mrs. Craven-Fair with the
.package. Nothing' that 'McEnerney could
GUARDED HIS WIFE
WITH A SHOTGUN
A Bride of Six Weeks Makes Sensa-
tional Charges Against Her
* Young Husband.
After six weeks of wedded "bliss" Mrs.
Josephine C. Cobb of 1413 Van Xess ave
nue has decided that longer residence
with her husband, Harry D. M. Cobb. a
clerk In the employ of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, would be extremely
unsafe, hence she sued him for divorce
on the ground of cruelty. , In her com
plaint Mrs. Cobb alleges that on the even
ing of February 8 last she forsook her
maiden name of Egan and became Mrs.
Cobb. After a brief wedding; tour the
young couple icturned ; to this city and
took up their residence at 1413 Van Ness
Just seventeen days of the honeymoon
had passed, she says, when her husband
pointed a loaded shotgun at her head. Two
days later, according to the complaint, he
choked her, and on March 5 locked her ln
her room and fctood guard at the dooi
with a loaded shotgun. She retreated be
hind a wardrobe and there remained until
her husband's anger cooled off. Mrs.
Cobb. in addition to a decree of divorce,
asks that her husband be compelled to re
turn her $500 she loaned him and pay her
permanent alimony in the sum of ?tt a
month. .
do shook the witness' testimony in this
regard. . Â¦
Secretary Rock of the Grand Jury, suc
ceeded Mrs. Gilleran on the stand. "Have
you any letter, Mr. Rock, purporting to
be from Mr. Dunand to myself?" began
Lafe Pence. Under objection the letter
was produced and read into the record.
It was nothing more or less than a letter
apprising Pence of Dunand's itinerary on
his Mexican and Central American trip.
Rock admitted that he had no other paper
signed by Dunand, Mrs. Craven-Fair or
Henry Koehler Jr. '
"In whose hands was the $30,000 contract
between Mrs. Craven-Fair and Mr. Du
nand when you . received it?" inquired
Lafe Pence.
To this McEnerney objected, provoking
a long speech from Lafe Pence, who de
clared that it was necessary and import
ant to know in whose . hands the paper
had been. The clock at this stage regis
tered adjourning time.
There was rather a full house for the
afternoon session, which did not last long
enough to satisfy a tithe of the idle curi
osity manifested In the case. Mrs. Craven-
Fair was expected to take the stand, but
again that lady remained away and the at
torneys for the Fair heirs were forced to
content themselves with a few interroga
tory shafts directed against the much
abused Mr. E. R. Rock. . . Â¦
Hardly had Judge Troutt taken his seat
when Lai' e . Pence arose and asked the
court to admit in evidence the famous
"Do you know your name" slip. Of
course, McEnerney battled against It,
claiming that it was not yet proved to
be in the handwriting, of James Q. Fair,
Tho court willed otherwise and the slip
was admitted.
Then Rock was called for the second
time during the day. The Pence brother
hood did not want much, but they wanted
that very badly. "Was the lead pencil
indorsement of the Dunand-Craven con

was Lafe Pence's inquiry. .With an ap
peal to the court before replying, and re
ceiving an answer from Judge Troutt to do
so, Rock, said that it was. Further ex
amination brought out the fact that the
Grand Jury did not have any other papers
with Mrs. Craven-Fair's signature- than
the contract to which she and Dunand had
subscribed their names. . The Simpton af
fidavit, called the "midnight affidavit,"
was produced by Mr. Rock on the request
of Attorney Pierson and read oft for the
benefit of the Pence brotherhood as well
as the phalanx of Fair attorneys.
Here the case came to its sudden and
unexpected adjournment. Judge Troutt
readily agreeing to the wishes of the at
torneys. .
The Assault on Barling.
The preliminary examination of Â¦P. Â¦-. J.
Curtin of Curtin's detective agency on the
charge of an assault with Intent to do
grievous bodily harm upon H. J." Barling,
a friend of Mrs. Craven,' was begun. befora
Judge Cabaniss yesterday afternoon. .
Mrs. Mary Ruggles, 812 Post street, tes
tified that she had gone with Barling to
Judge Troutt's courtroom to listen to the
testimony in the Craven-Fair case. -After
they left the courtroom two men attacked
Barling. They knocked him down and
beat him with their, fists and feet. She
was too excited to take particular notice
of the men.
Barling testified that he was. a salmon
packer. He recognized the defendant as a
man who had been following him around
for about two months prior to the assault
in. the corridor of the City Hall; He de
scribed how the defendant and the other
man attacked and kicked him on the face
and body while he was down. Â¦
E. W. Schmidt, an oil man from San
Diego, testified that he heard a . woman
scream and saw. a fight, but he* could not
identify the defendant. Theodore Kytka
also saw the fiay and heard the woman
scream. Ex-Chief Lees testified to lifting
Barling up after the fight and as to the
condition of his face.' The case was con
tinued till Friday. - %
CORRIGAN HAS
A BLACK LIST
FOR ENEMIES
Greenberg's Suit Against
Tanforan Track Is
on Trial.
Secretary Green Gives Interesting
Information Regarding Treat-
ment of the Un
favored.
Notwithstanding the existence of the
Horton law, Edward Corrigan and those
associated with him ln the mismanage
ment of Tanforan racetrack are now en
gaged ln an effort before Judge Dainger
field to establish their contention that the
pages of their "black l!Â«t" exceed ln power
and ehould be given precedence over stat
utory enactments and the law of common
reason.
The action by which Hyman Greenber*T
seeks to recover $10,000 damages from the
Western Turf Association for his unlawful
ejection from Tanforan track and for the
unlawful action of Corrigan and his asso
ciates, through the medium of Secretary
Fred H. Green, ln depriving him of lliÂ«
common right of entry to the track and
paddock, was called for trial yesterday.
Greenberg was the publisher of the.
Daily Racing Form. It was not claimed
that he sold his papers on the track in
opposition to the guide issued by Egbert
&. iikinner, who were granted the privil^go
of issuing the sheet by the Western Turf
As^ocia'Jcn, but his presence at the Â»xack
permitted him to become the possessor of
information enabling him to make op his
guide. Hence he was denied the pnvil*;ro
of the track, and on one occasion was
taken by the men under Captain Cuiluu
oan and hurled through the gate Into the
outside world. Greenberg filed suit, and
ehortly afterward, as bairn for his injured
feelings, suave Mr. Green informed him that
tilers was nothing against him and that
he would be cared for when the litigav.'jn
was all over, but his suit would be fought
that a precedent might be established
giving them a legal right to exclude such
persons from the track as they desiied.
i'here are several persons Corrigan and
associates would have removed from tn<s
gatesâ persons who watch for the evil do
ir.gs. the jobbery and nefarious schemes
of the racing promoters. So Corrigan Is
lighting for his precedent; but on the
other side the law and the facts exist, an.l
Lbe precedent may be an expensive one
for the track when the verdict is in.
When the case was called yesterday At
torney Edward C. Harrison appeared as
attorney for Greenberg and Attorney*
Gardner & Alexander represented the turf
association. Later in the day Mat Sulli
van was made counsel of record for the
plaintiff and the work of securing a jury
was undertaken. Following are those who
will decide between the law and Corri
gan's "black list":
T. W Collins, J. C. Peters. T. Emery S.
Bowman. J. H. Rosenbohm, John An
drews. H. 6. Field. John Sheehan. George
A. Ciuff. F. Sperling, John P. McDonnell
fend 1~ Bernstein.
The opening statement was made to the
Jury, and in the statement of the defend
ant's counsel their defense was msule
plain. The Western Turf Association
rlalms the power to exclude those whom
It desires, and the following clause ln its
answer to GreenWerg's complaint makes
this plain:
This defendant Is, and was at all times dur
ing the month of December. lSa9, the proprietor
of & racetrack or course situated ln the county
of San Mateo. known as Tanforan racetrack.
and was at all times mentioned herein ln the
pof?esfion thereof, and was, among* other
thlnpE. operating and conducting the name for
J's private business, for the profit of Its stock
holderi! and for the purpose of holding races
thereon; that at all times defendant had and
ptill has the riKht to the exclusive use of aald
rat-Â«-track eirainst all persons whatsoever; and
no person had or lias any right to enter or re
main upon said racetrack, or any part thereof,
except bjr the license of defendant.
Greenberg was the flrst witness, and
after testifying as to the manner in which
he was treated at the track, thrown out
by the hirelings of the association and
even denied the right to join the spec
tators, he left the stand, and Fred 11.
Green, secretary of the association, was
called. Green admitted that he had or
dered Greenberg's exclusion from the
track. He only wanted reliable informa
tion to pet to the public, he said, ani aÂ«
he had given the privilege to run the rac
ing form to Egbert & Skinner he did not
want Greenberg to get information at lhÂ«*
track which would enable him to "make'
a form book."
Finally Attorney Sullivan astonished
Green by asking: "Is it not a fact that
you exclude those people you do not llkÂ«- t
and if those people get on the track they
are put out?*
"Only bad characters are put out." an
swered Green, "unless 1 give special in
structions that an obnoxious party be put
cut."
"Is it not a fact that ther-e Is a black
list on which the names of several people
appear?" * .
"yep." answered the witness, eotto voce.
"Was Greei.berg on the black list?"
"Yes; but now we have no objection to
his coming to the track, if for purposes
other than those forbidden him." .
~What is the dally income of the
track?" asked Mr. Sullivan.
"Gate money, $10)0 a day; pool boxes,
tieSO; bar and other privileges. $412 50;
from the Telegraph companies for Informa
tion which they send to the many pool
rooms. 52T0 a day. The gross receipts are
about 15000 a day. and the net profit is be
tween $700 and SsOO a day."
Green then seft the stand, and Thoma*
F. Boyle testified as to the Â«rood character
of the plaintiff, after which an adjourn
ment was had until this morning.

SCHOOL BOARD STRIKES
BACK AT R.H. WEBSTER
Chairman Mark Replies to Criticisms
on the Methods of the ;*;AÂ«i
Directors. . . I
The Board of Education yesterday,
struck back at School Superintendent
Webster, who, for some time past, has
given expression to some severe strictures
regarding the policy of that body onva-:
rious matters affecting the welfare. of the'
public schools. President Mark presented,
an open letter, in which he says that his
attention has been called: to interviews
that have been published attacking " the
board for its method of conducting the
aflairs of the department. .'" â¢
"The Superintendent has seen fit,". says
Mr Mark, "to criticize us for the recent
consolidations. His statement; that .we
have thereby impaired the efficiency,, of
the schools is false. We have made com
paratively few consolidations and only
where the average daily attendance was
far below forty-five pupils to a class. The
Superintendent further states that In our
financial reports we have purposely mis
led the public by claiming a saving in the
department to our â¢ management and not
giving credit to the last board. If I have
seemed at any time to -take away any.
credit to which it was entitled I desire to
apologize for so doing. I
"The Superintendent further contends
that we have destroyed- the 'merit sys
tem' and substituted a plan of handing
out positions to favorites. I presume by
'merit system* he means observing strictly
the chronological order of appointment.
Length of service does ' not necessarily
make for efficiency, but breadth of expe
rience should be -the watchward. In all
our recent consolidations not one experi
enced teacher has been placed on the sub
stitute list, but all ' have been assigned
Immediately to a class. The base insinua
tion that we are In league with thoÂ»prin
cipals for the sole purpose .of .breeding
out teachers is an Insult to the board; and
any one who dares to make such a state
ment basely "misrepresents the facts of the
case. â¢ Â¦?Â¦-,
'"I deny that the board Intends to reduce
salaries, bu# we are determined to Â¦ con
duct the department on strict business
principles. The fact that the Janitors and
employes ln the : repair - department ; will
be paid by the Board of Public Works will
reduce the salary roll over $55,000 a year.

FISCHER SUCCEEDS IN
PLEASING THE PUBLIC
The New Concert House Opens TJnder
Auspices That Are More Than
Favorable. 1
Fischer's concert house at 122 O'Farrell
street, which opened for the first time on
Monday night, bids fair to become one of
the most popular places of amusement in
the entire city. /" ..
The capacity of the house is about 1000,
but such has been the rush the doors were
closed at a little after 8 o'clock last night,
and from that time until midnight the
doorkeepers had their hands full ln turn
ing away the disappointed ones who had
come too late to get a seat. :
The new concert hall Is beautifully deco
rated in white and gold, the acoustic* aie
excellent and the programme Â¦ that is
nightly rendered includes everything that
is best from ragtime to grand opera.
Taking it all in all the place is Just such
a one as the city has long wished lorâ a
place where the expense of admission is
small enough to allow of one dropping in
for an hour or so without feeling con
strained to remain during the whole pro
gramme in order to get his moneys worth.
The programmes rendered are the best
that musical talent <can produce, and the
regulations that govern the place make it
impossible for objectionable characters to
make their presence felt and give to the
house a reputation that might in time de
bar others from lending their patronage
to It.
The place will remain open every even
ing until midnight,, and matinees will be
given every Saturday and Sunday after
noon. It is the desire of Mr. Fischer to
give to the public a class of musical en
tertainment that will be attractive to fam
ilies, and to offer to the public a pro
gramme that may be enjoyed by the
wives and daughters of our nicest people.
Hence the matinees. :.:.;. , .;

Carts Passed Without Covers Through
th* Streets i and as Usual Dis- !
seminated the - Bacteria of
Di-ease Freely.
The police arrested one ' scavenger yes
terday for violating the -city ordinance,
which provides that it shall be unlawful
to use a cart for the collection and re
moval ..of general . refuse , unless j it
Â¦hall be perfectly tight and with a heavy
cover, to be approved by the Board of
Health, tightly fastened on at all UmM
when the owner or driver Is not collecting
or depositing the general refuse. How It
was that only one scavenger was arrested
does not appear. . All day there were un
covered scavenger carts, the drivers of
which were utterly ignoring the law, mov
ing about all over the city. There are over
200 licensed scavenger carts and all of
them were probably at ; work. There â¢ was
not a street through which they did not
pass at some hour of the day. The man
who I was taken in was C. Caesarevitch,
and he was arrested by Sergeant Tobln on
Powell street. â¢ - ...... ... .
Chief of ' Police Sullivan was asked yes
terday morning why no arrests were made
under the ordinance Â¦ when it was noto
rious that the scavengers were openly vio
lating it and had been doing so for a long
period. The Chief pulled down a copy of
the city ordinances and looked the matter
up, and at once gave an order for the ar
rest of violators of the ordinance in ques
tion. The order seemed to have little ter
rifying effect upon the law-breakers, for
some mysterious reason. Market street
and other principal streets -were crossed
and recrossed and traversed with impu
nity. 'Â¦: Not one scavenger cart in the city
engaged in collecting general refuse'yes
terday, or If ever, had a cover fastened to
it, as the ordinance directs. The nearest
approach to compliance was a' covering
of coarse cloth, partly over the load an-i
not attached to the cart, although tucked
under a part of the load to keep It from
blowing away. As a preventative against
the escape "of disease breeding bacteria It
was utterly and dangerously inadequate.
The ordinance provides for the approval
of the cover by the Board of Health after
Inspection, and no license can issue fur a
scavenger cart until after the Board of
Health has certified, through the proper
officer, that the ordinance has been com
plied with. Nevertheless there are in evl
dence over 200 licenses. The scavengers
have evidently bftlieved that the matter
could all be fixed up with the ~ officials,
otherwise they would not have ignored the
ordinance. A large body of citizens aro
determined that the loose methods of the
garbage collectors shall not be continued.
More developments are expected.
