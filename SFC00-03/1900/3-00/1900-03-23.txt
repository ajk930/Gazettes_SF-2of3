NOW OUT ON STRIKE
Machinists Employed in More Than

i CLEVELAND. March 22.â 1n accord
ance i with ,the i decision reached at the
meeting! wlilch lasted practically through
out the night, the machinists employed in
more, than fifty establishments laid down
their tools to-day. It is stated that 1500
men are out, including non-union. Should
the strike continue a few days several
thousand men in other trades dependent
on the machinists will become idle. The
strikers declare they will remain out un
til their demand for a nine-hour day with
ten hours' pay Is granted by the employ
ers.
In four establishments the machinists
were notified early in the day that their
demands had been granted. In these shops
the men continued at work. '
President O'Connell of the International
Machinists' Union 'has issued the follow
ing statement:
If the nine-hour day Is not wanted by the
employer* of machinists throughout the coun
try by April 1 there will be a. general strike.
Involving 200,000 machinists, and not a wheel
will be turned until that concession Is made.
Telegrams are pouring in from all sections
of the country asking permission to make the
demand. I am, however, trying to avoid the
necessity of a general strike, â¢ and If the offi
cers of the National Metal Trades Association
can be Induced to meet us In a spfrlt of fair
ness, without imposing unreasonable conditions
to their propositions, a general strike can be
averted. ..........

present strikes must = be - declared off for an
indefinite period before they will consider, the
question of arbitration an amicable adjustment
cannot be looked for. -

As to the reported exploits of Snyman* who Is said to have put Plumer's men to_ flight, an ,; account of the 'fighting from '

The often postponed marriage , has taken place- at last, though neither tht

The' little Princess was only 6 years] old when her father, came to his tragic

The mother's turn came when the Emperor decided to marry. his little grand

Stephanie, ; whereupon Elizabeth gave way . to an attack of hysterics. Stephanie
fled from: her 'daughter's, apartment and a physician was summoned. The girl

NEW YORK, March 22.â Justice Blsch
off of the Supreme Court to-day appointed
J. Hampton Dougherty receiver for D.
Appletorf & Co., publishers, on the appli
cation of Daniel Prltchard, a stockholder.
The bond of the receiver was : fixed at
$150,000. The liabilities are $1,110;000. The
assets consist of stock and outstanding
accounts. r V?
A reorganization committee, composed
of James G. Cannon, D. Juillard, Edmund
C. Converse, Warner Van Norden and
Charles Hathaway, has been formed and
will promptly submit a plan of reorgani
zation.
Mr. Cannon, chairman of the reorgani
zation committee, says he is confident the
firm can be liquidated so that there will
be no loss to creditors. The firm will go
on conducting Its business in the same
way, only that it will be under the re
ceiver's charge.
On February 1 Charles D. Appleton &
Co. gave out a balance sheet to the- stock
holders that showed a balance of $3,604,
028, including $190,387 cash on hand. The
liabilities were given the same as the
assets. The balance sheet filed to-day
shows the cash on hand almost exhausted,
while the item of bills receivable has de
clined from $1,140,000 to $1,110,000. owing to
an account which went by default yes
terday, the firm being unable to meet it.
A statement has been issued by D. Ap
pleton & Co. They say:
"The present situation is owing not to
undue business risk or to trade losses, but
merely to the fact that through the , ex
tension of our business on the installment
contract basis (which contracts . amount
to fully $200,000 now outstanding and in
due course collectable) our capital has be

Appleton, the eldest- son of the founder,
opened its London branch. . Other mem

The complaint further alleges that let
ters, of administration issued to John P.
Overton and ever since the said John P.
Overton â¢ has been and now is the duly
qualified and acting administrator of the
estate of the said Martha Lodge, as weil
as of that of the late J. D. Lodge; that
the said estate of the said Martha Lodge
was wholly acquired by her while living
with the said John D. Lodge, deceased,
and was made up and composed entirely
of property conveyed by the said John D.
Lodge directly and indirectly to her.
Letters Intercepted.
That for many years -immediately pre
ceding the death of the said John D.
Lodge he was so enfeebled In both body
and mind by the infirmities of age and
the excessive use of alcoholic stimulants
as to almost wholly incapacitate him for
the transaction of business and to render
him subject to the control and Influence
of the said Martha Lodge and others act
ing in her behalf and at her request; that
while in such condition the said Martha
Lodge, with the full knowledge that he,
the said John D. Lodge, had a wife and
a legitimate son living In England, whose
letters to the said John D. Lodge she reg
ularly intercepted, read and prevented
from falling Into his hands, continually
exerted all her influence on him, the said
John D. Lodge, to procure the transfer ot
his property both directly and Indirectly
to her, the said Martha Lodge, and that
she, by intriguing and conniving, caused
him to convey to her. the said Martha
Lodge, property worth and of the value
of about $50,000 without any consideration
therefor.
That much of the property so conveyed,
under duress and without consideration,
is now inventoried as part of the estate
of the said Martha Lodge, and other parts
of said property have been conveyed by
her to her said children or otherwise dls
pesed of. Wherefore the court wa^s also
asked to revoke the letters of adminis
tration issued to eaid John P. Overton as
administrator of the estate of the Inie
Martha Lodge and appoint Edwin Rey
nolds in his place. . â¢
Allegations Unexpected.
The startling allegations of the com
plaint have caused a great sensation herÂ«\'
where all the parties are well known.
Some weeks ago Davis E. Lodge, men
tioned hi the complaint as one of the
heirs, accepted $20,000 in cash from the
other heirs as his share of the estate and
departed for parts unknown. Some com
ment was caused by this ai the tlm-\ but
no one had any Idea that anything of the
present nature was coming.
The late J. D. Lodge resided for many
ytars in Petaluma, and laid the founda
tion of his fortune there in the junk busi
ness. Ke afterward moved to this city
and resided here until he died, being con
sidered for many years one of the heav
iest property owners in Sonoma County.
ANDREW CARNEGIE.
PITTSBURGH Pa., Maroh 22.->The
Carnegie Steel, Company, Ltd., be
comes a stock company with a cap
ital variously estimated at from
$200,000,000 to $250,000,000, the famous
"Iron-clad agreement" Is wiped out, all
litigation between the partners In the
Carnegie Company is dropped and H. C.
Frick, the former president: of the com
pany, virtually secures all he has con
tended for. These facts are embodied in
an authorized statement issued to-night
by the Carnegie Steel Company, Ltd.
The Atlantic City conferences resulted In
an agreement signed by all the parties in
terested except Mr. Frick and John Wal
ker, the latter the principal plaintiff in
the suit against the .H. C. Frick Coke
Company. The document reached Pitts
burg to-day, and after a comparatively
brief conference between the two gentle
men was signed by both of them.
To President C. M. Schwab is given the
credit for effecting this amicable agree
ment. From the first he was opposed to
be divided equally among all railroad* In
the pool. Some of the best railroad law
yers In the country declared such .an
agreement to be in direct violation of the
anti-trust law and that the raljroads In
the pool also violated the Interstate com
merce law by discriminating in the rÂ«te*
cmered parties, soldiers and actors or base
ball players.
According to the officials of the South
ern Pacific Company that organization ":a,
for once, not concerned in thÂ© generef
trouble. The present contention betweoa
the various roads operating in the West
and the' United States Government over
the transportation of soldiers for service
in the Philippines does not affect the tran
quillity of the Huntington corporation.
Owing to land grants and other arrange
ments entered Into between the Southern
Pacific and Uncle Sam: the former Is
obliged to carry troops over the greater
part of Its system, obtaining for their
transfer only Its regular proportion of tha
through haul. The only exception to tin*
general rule is on the Shasta division,
where the obligation assumed by â¢ tho
Southern Pacific is Increased, and 1* li
obliged to carry United States troops for
nothing.

DESERTED WHEN A CHILD
6ays That the Deceased Capitalist
Was Never Married to the
Woman Known as Mrs.
Martha Lodge,
Special Dispatch to The Call
SANTA ROSA. March 22.â A highly
sensational suit, involving the final dispo
sition of the vast estate left by the la - e
J. D. Lodge, -the well-known capitalist,
was commenced here this afternoon. Mr.
Ix>dge died at his home In- this city last
October, leaving an estate, worth consid
erably more thas a quarter of a million.
At the request of the heirs, letters of ad
ministration were Issued to John P. Over-
ton. president of the Savings Bank of
Santa Rosa, and steps were already 'well
under way to settle the estate according
to the terms of a will duly attested, which
the old man had prepared In anticipation
of his demise.
This afternoon a petition was filed by
Robert I). Lodge, a resident of Wakefield,
England, and who Is now in this city, ask
ing that the letters issued to John P.
Ovtrton be revoked and that supplemen
tary letters of administration be issued to
Kdwln Reynolds, a local capitalist ai-d
rr.cne> lender. In his prayer petitioner
allrges that he is the only rightful, law
ful and legitimate heir of the late J. D.
Ledge, and that he was born In England
on January 20, lttO. as the. result of a
lep.al marriage between J. D. Lodge, now
dr erased, and Miss Mary Redman, sol
emnized on February 22. 1546, in the par
iFh of Wakefleld, county of York, Eng
land: that after said marriage the
rouple lived together until some time In
I>O3. when the late J. D. Lodge left Eng
land for the United States, deserting nis
lamilv in ouest of a fortune.
Amasses a Fortune.
Soon aftor arriving in this country, the
complaint alleges, the late capitalist came
to California and settled in Sonoma Coun
ty, where he remained until the time of
his death, amassing a large fortune.- Dur
ing many years of that time, it Is further
alleged, said deceased 11%-vd with a certain
â¢woman who has long been known In this
<ounty and State as Martha Lodge and as
the reputed wife of the late J. D. Lodge:
that the said Martha Lodge was the
mother of the persons now claim'.ng'to be
the -heirs to the estate, namtl>â Sarah
Jane Harris. David E. Lodge and Matilda
A. Prince: that the said John D. Lodge
and said Martha Lodge were never mar
ried, and that the bonds of matrimony
between the former and his lewl wif-\
â¢ Mary Redman-Lodge, were never severed
until her dfatb. which occurred in 1592.
VANCOUVER. B. C. March 22.â The
little town of Kuskanook, at the
terminus of the Crows Nest Pass
and Nelson and Bedlington lines of
railway, was swept away by fire
just bofore noon to-day. Kuskanook was
one of the towns that grew up early last
year on the new railway operated by the
Canadian Pacific, and had a phenomenal
growth. Its population was something
over 1000, and most of these people are
now homeless from the results of the
quick blase that swept up the mountain
side from the shores of Kootenai Lake
this morning. The fire was all over in
about an hour, and the first news of It
that reached the outside was in a tele
gram to Mayor Garden of Vancouver
;iskir.g for cars of supplies and other
measures of relief.
So far the cause of the fire is a mystery.
It Blasted in the rear of Wright's grocery
store, which is built over the water at the
very foot of the town. The blaze was
not Â«een until it had enveloped practically
vhe whole of the foundation and the first
Fiury of the building. The other buildings
caught and the small bucket brigade that
Kathered could do nothing to stop the.
llames. A stiff breeze was blowing up
the lake at the time and fanned by this
the two larger stores and two hotels were
licked up in a few minutes. Luckily the
fire occurred when every one was out of
bed and the people got away at once to a
safe distance. More than half of those
who were in the town were either tran
sients or railway laborers, bo that the
loss in property will be comparatively
small. Many people went down to Nelson,
the principal city in the Kootenai, during
the day on special steamers, and others
are living in the few houses on the out
skirts that remain.
Mayor Garden of Vancouver and the
heads of other civic corporations In
British Columbia are taking action for
relieving the unfortunate people. Mayor
Garden this afternoon conferred with the
Board of Trade and a carload of provi
sions will be sent through at once.
A later dispatch to-night from Nelson
says that the Inhabitants of Kus
kanook were left absolutely destitute and
their immediate wants are being 'supplied
in both provisions and supplies from Nel
pon. The fire- Is supposed to be of incen
diary origin. Only three buildings in the
depot district were left standing, while
many of the buildings that were burned
were vacant. There was not a dollar of
Insurance in the town, but the buildings
were small and of cheap construction,
none being of stone or brick.

PHICAGO, March. 22.â There is little
prospect that the railroads will sue-
Uceed in forcing the Government to
pay higher rates for the transporta
tion of soldiers than the raih-cad3
have been in the habit' of makin?
for theatrical troupes, baseball ciubÂ«Â»,
brass bands and similar aggregations.
The general passenger agents of the
Western lines met here to-day and racked
their brains in order to devise some
scheme for forcing the Government to pay
the money It Is now withholding from
them, but. failed to reach any agreement
as to the course for them to pursue. Some
of the general passenger agents talked
loudly of a "test case" 'in the United
States Supreme Court, but attorneys for
other roads have given an opinion that the
general passenger agents would better set
tle their claims on the basis proposed by
the Government. It is well known that at
the beginning of the war with Spain the
railroads fought among themselves for the
privilege of transporting soldiers, and In
some cases made rates of only a fraction
of a cent a mile. The Western roads
seemed the first to realize that the Gov
ernment was compelled to transport the
soldiers, so they agreed to stop blddlnsr
against each other for the movement of
troops and agreed that, no matter which
line carried the troops, the profits should

under the "Iron-clad" provisions to resign.
As soon 'as the signatures of Mr. Frick
and Mr. Walker were affixed to the agree
ment to-day word was telegraphed to Mr.
Carnegie and this evening he authorized
the issue of a public statement announc
ing the settlement. ' . .
Mr. Frick refused to discuss the plans
of the reorganized company In detail when
questioned this evening. He said that the
arrangements entered into were satisfac
tory to him or he would not have signed
the agreement. When asked what would
be the value of the stock he would con
trol in the reorganized company Mr.
Frick replied that it was impossble at
present to answer that question, as the
capitalization of the new company had
not yet been determined. He would; like
all other stockholders, be given stock in
the new proportionate with the percentage
he held In the limited partnership con
cern. . Â¦i;
When asked about the "Iron clad" Mr.
Frick smiled and -said that nothing of that
kind could legally exist under an Incor

the matter no concern. The ex-chairman
refused positively to discuss the matter
any further, saying that all the Informa
tion necessary for publication had been
sent out by the company press agent.

head of the big combination, was met In

The spring exhibition of the San Fran
cisco Art Association was Inaugurated
last evening, ? and society and art con
noisseurs assembled to enjoy the \ very
creditable display made by local artists.
It was a ."retrospective exhibition"â that
is the greater number of the paintings on
view had been shown before, ' but hardly
under such favorable circumstances.
ror the flrst time paintings were hung
in the new Mary Frances Searles gallery
and the house gallery was given ovÂ«x to
the display of siatuary
. The ar lists make no claim for anything
startling in the present exhibition. How
ever, tney do claim that they have some
very good work to show, and all who were
fortunate enough to be present last even
ing must agree with the exhibitors.
â any of the most striking pictures at
the exhibition were shown at the Bohe
mian Club exhibition in the fall. Clawson
snows again his portrait of Miss Haden
feldt, and Orrin Peck, that stunning por
trait tnat was one of the features of the
club's exhibit.
. Jules Pages' "A Corner of the Studio,''
a magnificent canvas that captured a
medal in the Paris salon, is about one of
the finest things in the exhibition.
AH the artists who are locally famous
show much to uphold their deserved ar
tistic reputations.
Mrs. Mary Menton has quite a collection
of oils and water colors, and among her
best bits are: "Stretch of San Lorenzo
River," "Street Seene â Monterey," "Moon-
Jlght," "Pajaro Pumpkin Field," "Scene
in Tula, Mexico." "Cinnamon Teal Duck,"
"Ojltas." "Lilacs, Golden Gate Park."
In the statuary room Altkin's "Life's
Flowing Bowl" attracted great attention
and was surrounded the entire evening by
a crowd, both critical and curious.
The music, under the able direction of
Sir - Henry Heyman. was quite a feature
of the evening. The exhibition will con-

A New York Business Man
Discusses Things
Commercial.
W. H. Cranberry, Although a Demo
crat, Praises the Financial Con
fidence That Came From
Republicans.
Among the arrivals of yesterday at the
Palace was W. H. Granberry, one of the
governors of the New York Stock Board
and chairman of the stock committee.
Mr. Granberry is making a pleasure tour
of the United States, accompanied by bis
wife and daughters, and will return to
his home after thoroughly seeing the
sights of San Francisco and visiting the
Big Trees and other points of interest that
he ha 3 not already viewed.
When seen in his apartments in the ho
tel last evening and asked concerning the
condition of business throughout the
United States, Mr. Cranberry expressed
himself as perfectly satisfied with the
way things were going. Â¦-Â¦'Â¦.
"The country." he said, "has seldom, in
fact never, been in a better condition
than it is to-day. On my way out to the
coast I passed along tne Atlantic sea
board ana thence through a large section
of the south, and thus had an opportunity
of seeing for myself the general business
activity that pertains in those parts. of
the Union. Ine South 13 truly a new
South in every sense of the word. The
States that were formerly. content to be
producers have at last branched out and
now, instead of sending their products to
the looms . of the North, do their- own
manufacturing.' And this they are doing
on no small scale, either, let me tell you.
"Take the little city of Charlotte. N. C.
for Instance. It contains fourteen facto
ries within the limits of its corporation,
and within a radius of 1W miles there
have sprung up so many others that
within that small circle there is. now con
trolled practically the cotton industry of
tne entire Unlteo. States.
"New Orleans and Mobile are, of course,
the big shipping points of the South, but
there is springing up under the stimulus
given' to if by the railroad a rival in the
port of Galveston that bids fair to make
the other and older places look to their
laurels. The iron industry of Alabama iÂ»
also forging ahead -and is making Pitts-
Durg look to itself tor the supremacy in
tnat line of business.
"As to the effect these improvements
have had on prices I need merely tell
you that in the last three years the price
of Alabama Iron has trebled, and cotton
In the Carolina* has gone up from 5 to it
cents. This means an Increase of about
â¢0 per cent in the protits of the producer.
"In the East money is pretty high, but
that must '.not -be - taken ~~ as r anything
against the general prosperity of r the
country. On tne contrary. It is from this
very prosperity - that ' the increased rate
of interest arises. . After the panic of 1&93
people were so chary, about putting their,
capital Into 'anything -that one if he had
gilt-edged security could : borrow Â¦at a
nominal ngure, say.l or 2 per cent. Peo
ple were not sure of things and preferred
sinking their wealth in Government bonds
or something of that sort rather than to
chance It in investments. that might col
lapse.- But this uncertainty has been' aK
done away with. People with capital to
spare now know that they: may Invest it
with the certainty of getting 8 or 10 per
cent returns, and therefore they demand
a correspondingly- high rate of Interest
when they are approached for a loan. : â¢
"Am I a Democrat? Yes, I- 1 am; 'but 'l
am also a strong McKlnley man, aa li
I many another Democrat throughout . the
i United States. I think there is no doubt
'of Mr. McKlnley's re-election. The gen
eral prosperity existing under his admin
istration makes Â¦ that â¢Â« almost ' an assured
fact. But I look for a quiet time in the
mercantile^world ,from ; now-: until: next
November. You'see, businessmen always
consider the possibility of their being mis
taken, no ' matter i how remote â¢ that Â¦ possi
bility may s be: " Therefore " they , will not
open out until they are assured of which
way the Presidential cat Is going to Jump.
"The Philippines have been a-.->a -.-> great
stimulus â¢: to trade . through .- the ' Impetus
glvenirto if by.Â»the> immense army the
Government"' has' sent there.*' This,- bow
ever, is. nothing to what will 'come .when
the military has asserted its supremacy
and a civil form of government baa been j
thoroughly established. Then the Islands
will be thrown open' for investment and
capital will flock to them with a rush. I
am afraid, however, that the boom will
be overdone and a reaction will follow
before the prosperity that is bound to ac
crue from their acquisition is fixed on a
Brm and lastine basis."..

whenever he is pitted against- anybody
who can fight he tries to dodge the issue.
"When did be ever try to hedge?" asked
the reporter.
"Why. he dodged Fltzsimmons on Tues

Tom declared be would not leave Stattn

then I threatened to make little Waluott

from euch an act finally shamed him Into

The students of the Normal School de

: LONDON, March 22.â There was consid

tempts. on the part of Irish : members to
secure more of the House's time,- in which
they succeeded after noisy, displays, of

their '; 1 opponents. 'Only the", tact of. Mr.
<Balf our," the Government leader, saved the
uproar* from developing into a. scene of
violent disorder.; . : â¢â¢ ' ' ; !
_ The discussion pf the financial relations
between Ireland and Great Britain was
set down- for to-day and John Redmond,
the Irish leader, desired to obtain all the
time possible.- Therefore, he appealed tq
the promoters of the London water bill to
postpone its second reading for a couple of
days, so that' the Irish side might be thor
oughly discussed. The promoters agreed,
but the "Speaker, Mr. 'Gully, pointed out
that the orders of. the day provided for
the discussion of the London bill, and that
he was bound to see the orders obeyed.
Irish interruptions followed to such an ex
tent that the Speaker threatened to treat
them as disorderly. -Â¦- â¢-Â¦ . Â¦ : â¢
The Irish members appealed to'the pres
ident of the local Government Board, Mr!
Chaplin, to postpone the debate. Mr.
Chaplin said ne saw no objection at first,
but after the attitude displayed by the
Irish members; the position of affairs had
been entirely altered. They had endeav
ored, he declared, "to coerce the House
and to yield would be the worst kind of
precedent.
Further attempts to speak were howled
down by the Irfsh- members and the dis
turbance grew worse each moment, when
Mr. Balfour opportunely entered. -Amid
loud Irish cheers. Mr. John Redmond ap
pealed to Mr. Balfour to intervene and
the latter agreed to Â¦ a postponement,
which was adopted after further noisy and
disorderly discussion, during which Mr.
George G. Hartley, Conservative, depre
cated the House allowing a "rabble to dic
tate to It." Later he was forced to with
draw the obnoxious epithet.
Arthur O'Connor. Irish "Nationalist,
opened the debate on the overtaxation of
Ireland, which, he declared, from the date
of the union to 1890, exceeded the war in
demnity paid by France to Germany. He
moved that the Government take steps to
remedy this state of affairs.
Patrick .T. Power, Irish Nationalist, sec
onded the motion.
The motion of Mr.- O'Connor was reject

Two horses attached to a cart of the City
Street Improvement Company's street
cleaning service fell into a ditch near the
corner of Mission and . First streets last
niffht From this followed a string of
mishaps, including the serious injury of
Robert Stanovich, a watchman, living at
312 Sixth street, several toes of his left
foot being crushed, by a falling derrick
and the breaking of a water pipe that
flooded the ditch and nearly drowned the
helpless horses. A score of persons stand
ing near the derrick when it fell narrowly
escaped serious injury.
The horses took their tumble soon after
9 o'clock. James Egan was driving and
although there was a string of lights
along the eide of the ditch giving notice
of danger he guided the horses so close
to the edge that the earth caved in and
overturned the wagon, precipitating the
horses into the hole.
- The poor beasts landed in the bottom of
the ditch tail to tail and there they lay
four hours kicking each other at intervals
and struggling helplessly. The police
telephoned for the officers of the- Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
to send an ambulance. In about an hour
it arrived in charge of Officer Matt Mc-
Curry, who immediately proceeded to
raipe an iron derrick about twelve feet
high. Ropes were fastened to one of the
horses and a # force of men began to pull.
The other horse ; began >to kick
again and' broke the water main, from
which water began to flow, threatening to
flllthe ditch. The men at this pulled as
fast as possible and got one horse to the
surface safely.
Robert Stanovich had hold of a rope tied
around the horse to swing it clear of the
ditch when suddenly the derrick fell with
a crash. It grazed George Mclntyre in its
fall, narrowly missed several others and
struck Stanovich on his left foot. Stano
vich was taken to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, where it was thought that the
Injured toes might have to be ampu
tated.
After an hour of hard work the, sec
ond horse was rescued. From 9 o'clock to
midnight one track of the Mission-street
electric road was blocked.
for the title and the winner's end of the
receiptsâ about $7500. On the past per
formances of the two men It la safe to
predict that it will be one of the hardest
battles ever fought for the title. The pre
vailing price is 100 to 80 on Gans, but some
big wagers have been made at 100 to 70,
notably one of $2000 to $1400.

HAWTHOBNB VI.
most heavily played dog was Dr. Ruther
ford Harris* Hawthorne VI, which car
ried the royal commission of Â£10,000 ($50,
000). Hawthorne made a good showing
in his first trial, but was beaten in the
Â«>mi-finals. Such heavy betting had
never been witnessed at the Waterloo
cup meeting before, and the dog's ad
mirers must have been extremely confi
dent of his sucopss.
In private trials Hawthorne VI had
shown such remarkable speed and ability
to keep with the hare that a syndicate of
Lancashire sportsmen decided to back
him to the limit. The result was that a
perfect flood of money poured in on the
bookmakers. Experts who had seen Haw
thorne VI perform expressed the opinion
that he resembled the great Fullerton, the
three time winner of the- Waterloo cup,
in speed and action.
While coursing has been popular In Ensr
land_ for , more than 150 years, there Is
every evidence that its popularity is
steadily ifcreasinjr.
A few years ago the successful candi

l)te weight in copper. He is now worth
his weight in gold, either in America or
England. In fact, Mr. J. 11. Rossetter of
this city is said to have refused a $10,00*3
offer for For Freedom. , . ,
- For Freedom was bought when a purjrjy

Clark of Missouri proposed and the
House adopted an amendment which he
said was in the interest of the country
editor, allowing sample copies to 100 per

Snodgrass of Tennessee offered a sub

Very Unlikely That It Will Come Up
Again at This Session, as Loud
mSays He Is Tired
of It.
"WASHINGTON, March 22.â After a
spirited discussion extending over three
days the Loud bill relating to second class
mall matter was Â¦ recommitted by the
House to-day to the Committee on Post
offices and Post Roads. The majority in
favor of recommitting was so decided
that it is considered unlikely that the
measure will again appear during the
present session. Loud said after the vote
was announced that this was the third
time and out as far as he was concerned.
The vote on the motion was 14S to 5(6, with
16 present and not voting.
Moon of Tennessee- opened the discus
sion for the opposition. He discussed at
length the handling and transportation
of mail matter, maintaining there could
be no evil effect' from permitting the seo
ond class matter the privileges it has now.
He made a strong plea for the retention
as. second class matter of certain litera
ture, which he said was so valuable to the
people and such means of instruction and
education to the people.
Th# education of the people was mor*
important, he said, than a small bit of
revenue to the Government.
Talbert of South Carolina declared the
present law sufficiently covered the sub
jects touched, upon by the bill, and said
the country editors would be the heaviest
sufferers by the passage of the bill.
Cummlngs of New York in a character
istic speech opposed the bill in the interest
of every man who wants cheap litera
ture, every typesetter and every book
binder in the city of New York. He de
clared that by the enactment of the pend
ing bill Congress would take work from
every man interested In the printing trade.
Moody of Massachusetts closed the gen
eral debate in support of the bill. HÂ©
carefully analyzed the provisions of the
bill, presenting as he proceeded arguments
in favor of each provision. The weight
of his early argument was in support of
the bill because it would save to the Gov
ernment an enormous sum of money per
annum. With the money which the Gov
ernment 'had lost on second class mail
matter during the past ten years. Moody
declared, it could have constructed the
Isthmian canal or a fleet of modern bat
tleships.
In conclusion Moody made a strong ap
peal for the passage of the bill as a meas
ure "on the side of the people and against
the special and selfish interests."
Rldgley of Kansas declared that the
railroad companies were to-day telegraph
ing members to support the bill. He
deemed this particularly significant of the
interest railroads had in the matter. The
fight, he said, would. never end until Gov
ernment ownership of railroads had be
come an accomplished fact.
Cowherd of Missouri, speaking in sup
port of the bill, said every official who
had investigated the subject, had given

the plague and suspicious cases are
merely sporadic, the period of intermis

Nine days had passed without a new case,
when on Sunday last a Chinese case was

STAMPEDE OF
NOME MINERS
TO KOYOKUK
Rich Finds Reported on
Many of Its Tribu

Old Claims Which Have Been Thrown
Open on Account of Failure of
Owners to Work Them
Being Relocated.

Sl>ec!al Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 22.â Copies of
the Nome ' News received here tell of the
discovery of new and rich finds on the
tributaries of the.Koyokuk and of the
stampede of throngs of Nome miners to
relocate some thousand or more claims
that have been thrown open through the
failure of their owners to do development
work on them.
In its Issue of December 30 the News
says: A party composed of Jack Webster,
John Reynolds and John McLean have ar
rived at Nome from Weare, at the mouth
of the Tanana. Mr. Webster says that a
big strike has been made on Slate and
Myrtle creeks, which run into the Koyo
kuk about 650 miles up that river. This
he learned from Captain White, a steam
boat man he met at Nulato. Captain
White had told him- "that the Klondike
was a grubstake country compared with
the Koyokuk."
Mr. Webster confirmed the report that
the bodies of two men had been seen float
ing down the Yukon at Koyokuk Station.
He said he had been Introduced to. the two
dead men, who were a doctor and a drug
gist, by a man who accompanied them,
before they started on their journey down
the river in a zinc boat. He .believes all
three perished. He could not give their
names. The same paper says:
Â¦ "For several days past scores of men
have been pushing out of town in all di
rections â east, west and north. Several
dog teams left for the Golovin country on
Thursday. The cause of this unprece
dented amount of traveling is that num
bers of claims will be open for relocation
after January 1. hence the anxiety of so
many to be on the ground.
"A. Bertillion, who has just returned
from a trip up the Nome River to the
head and thence back by. way of Anvil
Creek, says there are 300 or 400 men
camped along the route traversed by him.
Some are doing a little prospecting, but
most of them are watching some claim or
other which they propose to jump.
"The stampeders who hopaÂ»to find good
claims to be relocated are not confined to
the male persuasion, for' numbers of
women have started out to find some min
ing property and others are in with the
push. â¢ .
"The number of claims staked this yeaÂ»-
In the Cape Nome mining district Is about
500 and assessment work has been done on
300 claims. Fifty-four quartz claims were
also recorded during 1899, 218 beach claims
and 275 tundra claims. "
"Since the district was organized, en
October. 15, IS9B, 4000 claims approximately
have been recorded."

first witness called in rebuttal of the
charges which have been made. He is a
type of the sturdy Far West of years
gone by. He is of mass!ve build, and his
Indifference to the conventionalities is
shown by a refusal to wear a necktie. A3
he took the stand he spread before him
several hundred telegraphic dispatches
The examination was conducted by J. C.
Cheney, one of the counsel for the de
fense.
Governor Steunenberg said he was elect
ed Governor of Idaho in 1895 on the Peo
ple's Democratic ticket, having accepted
the nomination of the Democratic con
vention. He read telegrams dated several
days prior to the blowing up of the Bun
ker Hill mill on April 29 and leading up to
that event. On April 26 Frederick Bur
bridge of. the Bunker Hill mine tele
graphed that fin armed mob bad stopped
the Bunker Hill men from working, :aid
â¢ he called for protection to the property
interests. He also read many telegrams
to and from the Sheriff and others, show
ing the steps taken to maintain order. The
Governor suggested arbitration of differ
ences, but in answer Mr. Burbridge stated
that there was nothing to arbitrate, and
again called for protection.
On April 29, the day of the blowing up
of the mill. Governor Steunenberg said
he received at 10:37 a. rn. a dispatch from
Mr. Burbridge stating that all the mintT3
of Canyon Creek had laid off and were
coming to Wardner to menace the Bunker
Hill men. This was accompanied by an
other request for protection. At the 3amÂ»
time dispatches were received from A. L.
Mohler of the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company, first stating that an
armed force had taken possession of the
railway tracks at Wardner. and then, at
4 p. m., stating that the rioters had set
fire to the mill, that they had placed dy
namite under it and that it would be
blown up. Sheriff Young also telegraphed
him from Wardner that â¢ the mill tvs.%
blown up and described the gravity of the
situation. At 6 p. m., the Governor taid.
he sent a dispatch to the President calling
for Federal aid. as the Idaho troops vrera
absent In the Philippines.
The Governor said he had been ill prior
to the Coeur d'Alene excitement, ana:bo
ing unable to go in person he sent a repre
sentative, Bartlett Sinclair, to the sÂ«*it f.f
disorder. On April 30 Sinclair telegraphed,
urging that the President be advised to
rush troops from the nearest post. He
also telegraphed that he had thoroughly
Investigated the need of martial law; that
the local administration of the law was a
farce and amounted to maladministration;
that people were afraid to testify and that
masked men were prowling about the
town terrifying people. Many like tele
grams, showing the exciting developments
from day to day, the arming of the citi
zens, the making of arrests, etc.. were
read by the Governor. On this Informa
tion, and on his own knowledge of affclr*
for six years, including repeated outragâ¬3,
with apparently no effort to -apprehend
the guilty parties, the Governor said he
proclaimed that a state of insurrection
and rebellion existed at the scene of dis
turbance.
Governor Steunenberg said he cautioned
Mr. Sinclair not to align himself with
either side, employers or employes. Sin
clair had made speeches in New. York for
Henry George, so that the Governor said
he regarded him as qualified to glVa fair
consideration to the labor situation.
Representative Lentz objected at this
point to the line of inquiry by Mr. Cheney
and questioned the propriety! of having
private counsel direct the investigation.
Chairman Hull replied that the prosecu
tion had selected Mr. Lentz to direct. its
side, Mr. Robinson, an'attorney for , the
miners, having assisted, and said the de
fense was entitled to have counsel. . The
committee voted to permit the question
to stand as the â¢ attorney propounded it.
As there were frenuent objections to ques
tions, the committee agreed : to a motion
by Mr. Sulzer. that the Go\'ernor be al-
lowed to tell his story in his own way,
without interruption.
Governor Steunenberg then related In
detail the steps taken .to carry out the
proclamation. He said arrests were made
of those reasonably suspected of com
plicity in the disturbance.
The Governor said he took such precau
tions.as were possible to look after the
prisoners, but tne conditions of the insur
rection were most unusual and at every
point the authorities were . embarrassed
by the insurrectionary element. He visit
ed, the barn and the stockade occupied by
the prisoners and sought to have the
stockade or permanent quarters com
pleted. He said he talked with the pris
oners, who told him that the bread was
too light, but that everything else was all
right. The chief commissary of the State
Informed him that the parties who fur
nished the bread had been waited upon
by a committee and warned that they
must not continue the supply. A bakery
was thereafter built by the authorities
and good bread sunrilled. . .
Governor Steunenberg was asked where
the insurrection had its inception and
what mining camps were engaged in it.
He said that, in his opinion, the mining
of Shoshcne County had been In a
state of. insurrection since 18S2. The in
surrection of April 2P, he said, started at
Durke. where a meeting was held in the
hall of the Western Federation of Miners.
The participants proceeded to arm them
p^lves and went by train to Wardner. At
Gem, he said, a similar meeting at a sim
ilar hall was held and arms and masks
were distributed. He described the gen
eral concentration of the men at Ward
ner, where, he said, they waited in a dis
organized state until a single engine ar
rived from Wallace. Then systematic.or
ders were given, the first being "Wardner
to the front."
A party secured dynamite which was
placed under the mill and set off. Firing
then began Indiscriminately and one of
the invading party was killed. Some of
the Bunker Hill employes were taken
prisoners by the masked men.
The Governor's description was extend
ed and circumstantial and brought out
frequent objections from Mr. Lenta on the
ground that It was hearsay.
Governor Steuenenberg was asked what
part the United States troops took In
the arrest and detention of Imprisoned
miners. He said the position they occu
pied wap the same as that wh'ch thÂ«Â»
State militia would have occupied If they
had been available.

LICENSED GUIDES.
CHIEF SULLIVAN has .recommended to the
Police Commissioners that all licenses ta
Â¦Chinatown guides be revoked, and is reported
to have declared an inability to perceive the need of
licensed guides for that or any other portion of the
city.
Here is a clear case of zeal outrunning not discre
tion only, but common sense itself. Licensed guides
are a necessity of the age. In our time tourists are
numbered by the thousands. Every city of consider
able size, or of any interest either by reason of its
history or its picturesque location, attracts them. In
the great majority of instances tourists desire some
one acquainted with the locality to show them about
the place in order that they may be sure of seeing
all that is noteworthy and of understanding what
they do see. To meet that demand the professional
guide has come into existence. He is a necessary
part of the population of every city that attract* tour
ists, and is to be found in them all.
So long as tourists continue to travel and are eager
sightseers, so long will there be a demand for
guides, and so long as the profession is lucrative
there will- be persons to follow it. By requiring
guides to take out a license the municipal authorities
assure strangers from falling into the hands of rascals
or the touts â¢of gambling-rooms, and thus render
sightseeing much safer than it would be otherwise.
To revoke all such licenses would give the touts an
advantage they do not now possess, and as a result
many a stranger would be duped and fobbed by
them.
Sightseeing is a legitimate desire on the part of
every one who visits a strange place. Nearly every
one who comes to, San Francisco on business or on
pleasure wishes to see those localities of the city
which are noted as peculiar to it, or are much talked
of. Chinatown is one of the show-places of San
Francisco, just as the catacombs are of Rome or the
sewers of Paris. People like to see them, notwith
standing their gloom and their discomforts. It is
therefore imperative there should be Chinatown
guides, and to refuse to license honest and intelligent
men to perform the work would simply open a way
for rascality to practice frauds upon the tourists who
visit us.

ANGLO-AFRICAN POLICY.
IT. would be interesting to make such an analysis
as will reveal the effect, if any, that modern,.
Christian civilization has had upon statecraft and
the morality of nations. Apparently it is inappreci
able. The course of the United States for the last
two years is full of incidents which show an abso
lute decadence in conscience since Greece and Rome,
and Great Britain seems about to furnish further illus
trations in her African policy. That she intends to
destroy the republics . and forcibly incorporate their
people in her empire there is no longer any doubt.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, announces that policy in the debate which
we. have published. In answering Sir W. Harcourt
he said: "We hoped that whe/i President Kruger
saw how little it was we asked, and how determined
we were to have it, he would give way."
Yet in 1896 Mr. Chamberlain, then, as now, Colo
nial Secretary, said: "To go to war with President
Kruger to enforce upon him reforms in the internal
concerns of the Transvaal, in which successive Sec
retaries of State have repudiated all rights of inter
ference, that would have been a course of action as
immoral as it. would have been unwise." If he told
the truth three years ago, no matter "how little" in
terference he asked last year in the Transvaal, he had
no right to ask any at all nor to impress Kruger with
his determination to get it, thereby trying to intimi
date him into concessions that were declared beyond
the right of England to ask. Mr. Chamberlain makes
it plain that when he asked in 1899 what in 1896 he
said England had no right to ask, it was for the pur
pose of forcing war upon the Boers.
In 1896 he had said to go to war over the very issue
he made in 1899 would be "immoral and unwise." In
the Harcourt debate he said the war over Kruger's re
fusal to permit internal interference in the Transvaal
is, on England's part, "a just, righteous and neces
sary war." If just such a war, for precisely the same
cause, was "immoral" in 1896, what has made it "just
and righteous" in the short space of three years, dur
ing which none of the issues involved has shifted a
single span from the position they occupied three
years before?
What has effected the moral and ethical transforma
tion is perhaps unconsciously revealed by Mr. Cham
berlain in the same speech, when he said: "Never
again, with our consent, if we have the power, shall
the Boer be able to erect in South Africa a citadel
whence proceed disaffection and race animosity to
endanger the paramountcy of Great Britain. Never
again shall he be able to treat an Englishman as if he
belonged to an inferior race."
Translated by the key of the history of the casÂ»,
that means that Great Britain intended from the be
ginning to destroy the republics, in order to be su
preme in South Africa, and that makes a war just and
righteous now that was "immoral and unwise" three
years ago.
The appeal to English bumptiousness is enough to
make the Muse of History laugh as it goes into her
record. The Boers refused to let the English treat
them as an inferior race ( and that is always resented
as interference with the natural rights of an English
man. Denial of his superiority by anybody is taken
to be affirmation of his inferiority! and if he is. a
tourist he writes to the Times about it. If he is a
rabid speculator, like Rhodes, he organizes a Jame
son raid. If he is Secretary of State for the Colonies
he goes to war, if the enemy is weak enough to jus
tify it.
The Jameson raid, the fruit of a conspiracy with
Cecil Rhodes, from which Mr. Chamberlain has
never cleared his skirts, was the beginning of that
''race hatred" of which he complains now. It taught
the Boers that their English neighbors proposed to
respect none of their rights, and the preparations then
begun for defense are amply justified, though they
may prove inadequate, because a state with only about
160,000 people cannot long resist an empire with
400,000,000.

"CY" CONCILIATES.
In the cloakrooms they tell a funny
story at the expense of Cy Sulloway, the
tall Congressman from New Hampshire.
Cy is a picturesque and graphic talker,'
wherein lies some of the point of the
story.
In the campaign of 1836 Sulloway went
to Portsmouth, N. H., to make a speech.
The Republicans there, knowing his flery
nature, waited upon him with a few words
of warning and explanation. "Cy," said
they, - "the Democrats around here will
vote for McKlnley this year if you don't
scare them oft. Whatever you say In your
speech; don't get the Democrats mad.
Conciliate them, Cy; conciliate them."
Sulloway shook his shaggy locks by way
of understanding and approval. "All
right!" he said. v
The speech began. It ran along all
right enough until Sulloway approached
the sins and shortcomings of the Demo
cratic party. Then hÂ« grew emphatic and
eloquent; also-severe. '.'lf before me," he
said, "was a yawning chasm, and at the
bottom of the chasm were the flres of hell,
and if above the chasm was suspended a
basket containing the entire Democratic
party,- do you know what I would do?"
â¢ The crowd listened intently. The Dem
ocrats present were especially anxious to
hear the answer. - p*

MR. SULZER'S CAVORTING.
WHEN at a Tammany banquet last fall Mr. Sul
zer was put forward as New York's candidate
for Democratic leadership in the House of
Representatives, there was an expectation throughout
the country that the new man might prove himself to
be possessed of at least a fair degree of political as
tuteness, even if he lacked statesmanship, and that
he would be able to show an appearance of dignity
even when he failed to manifest the wisdom that
should go with it. All such expectations have been
disappointed. Sulzer failed to receive the support of
any considerable number of Democratic Congressmen
in his candidacy for the leaderships but he has man
aged to make himself conspicuous, notwithstanding,
and as a result he is now known to th^ country as
about the nearest approach to the colt of a wild ass
that ever kicked and brayed in the House of Repre
sentatives.
It appears to be the ambition of Sulzer to pose as
the only American patriot in Congress, and at the
same time to be the mouthpiece of the yellow journals
of New York. No matter how silly be the fake in the
way of politics the yellows may devise out of their
lunatic imaginations, Mr. Sulzer is ready to bring it
before the House and make upon it a speech full of
froth and fury, but signifying nothing.
His latest exhibition has been that of demanding
that the War Department furnish the House with all
the information it has concerning the British forti
fications on this continent and particularly those
along our northern border. It will be remembered
that the yellow journals discovered a few days ago
that the British have a fort at Esquimalt, and that the
officers in charge will not admit yellow artists to take
kodak views of the guns,- magazines and other fea '
tures of the forts. Since the reporters could not ob
tain the information from the British, Mr. Sulzer
undertook to obtain it for them from the War Depart
ment at Washington. Of course the War Department
declined to make its military information public.: To'
the demand of Sulzer the reply- came back: "The in
formation the department possesses on this and like
occasions has always been held confidential, and for
good and sufficient reasons has not been made pub
lic." The reply gave Sulzer the opportunity he de
sired for a wild ass exhibit on the floor of the House,
and strange and wonderful was the use he made of it.
Had a wanderer from a far land, ignorant of our poli
ticsâsome wild man of Borneo, for exampleâ heard
Sulzer's speech he would, have concluded the Ameri
can Government had sold itself to Great Britain and
that the only virtue left in the United States is. that
which lies in the tongue of Sulzer himself. .
Of course the object of all this is something, more
than that of revealing to the public what a donkey
a Congressman - can make of himself when ; he 'tries/
Sulzer is doing Tammany politics as well as yellow
PORTO RICAN POVERTY.
THE Humboldt Standard permits itself to be
excited because it thinks The Call sneers at
Porto Rican poverty, caused, according to the
Standard, by a hurricane.
If our critic will analyze his feelings he will dis
cover that he is in a bad humor on his own account
and not on account of the Porto Ricans. From the
world's earliest knowledge of them, all tropical peo
ple have been poor. Wealth and progress depend on
the exertion of man and not the bounty of nature.
Nature is bountiful in the tropics because the climate
disfavors human exertion. ;, b; /
All this we pointed out to the imperialists long ago,
and they were not, impressed by it. Now as our sev
eral tropical paradises, one after another, hold up
their hands for alms, and we call attention to it, the
imperialists whine that we sneer at poverty! We arc
determined, as far as we can influence the decision,
that poverty in the United States shall not be pro
duced by taking in eighteen millions of tropical peo
ple and giving them free trade, to compete with our
labor. Poverty in the tropics is chronic. It grows
out of climatic conditions. Yet it is not the sort of
poverty that free trade brings to the workingmen of
the United States. Tropical people are poor, but the
poison climate in which they gender and die. produces
spontaneously most of what is needed to supply their
physical wants. They have not the need for exertion
that northern people have.
But poverty among us it a very different thing.
Not being able to buy food, poverty means starva
tion. . Not being able to buy fuel, poverty freezes to
death. ,The horrors of poverty are -found only
among the temperate zone races, for its sorrows and
burdens are mtlltiplied by that very vigor of climate
which puts into man the energy-thai must be exerted
to support* life.
The tropical wage scale is about 25 cents a day.
Labor at that wage competes with ours. "Does the
Standard wish free trade with that motley horde of
eighteen millions?
We don't, and propose to aid in preventing 1 it, no
matter, by whom proposed. ,
As for the Porto Ricans, they, were. not in revolt'
against Spain, but were tumultuous in their desire to
break into this country. , Now, according. to the Stan
dard, they appear to think that they have been ad
mitted to an eleemosynary institution, entitled to their
bed.board and tobacco. We are perfectly willing to
let them return to Spain if they wishi or set up for
themselves* if they can, but we don't want them in
the 'United States in any capacity whatever.

honor of one of their national holidays. The march
of the hatchetmen ought to form an interesting fea

SOME "BUBONIC" EFFECTS
OTWITHSTAXDIXG the prompt exposure
I of the insufficiency of the evidence upon which
the Board of Health started its "bubonic
plague" quarantine in Chinatown, the action of the
board, supported as it was by its sensational yellow
organ, has injured the repute of the city and exerted
a malign influence whose effects are beginning to
be noted all along the Pacific Coast and in the East.
Dispatches from Victoria announce that the Cana
dian Government has ordered the authorities at that
I>ort to quarantine all steamers from San Francisco
until further notice, and the further information
comes that the steamer Curacao has been held in
quarantine at Mazatlan, Mexico. In both cases the
quarantine is based upon the report that San Fran
cisco is infected with, bubonic plague. Thus the folly,
or worse, of the Board of Health has already proven
?. blight upon our shipping interests and innocent
persons suffer loss and inconvenience because of it
Evils of this kind are much more easily started
than remedied. 11l reports travel fast and grow as
rapidly as they travel. A story that originated with
one Chinaman supposed to have been inflicted with
the plague may be spread about the world in the form
of a rumor that the plague is raging here and that
the port is badly infected.
We have a startling illustration of the rapidity with
which exaggerations in cases of this kind get about
among even well informed people in a telegram
which we print this morning from a gentleman in
Rochester, N. V., warning his son to leave San
Francisco at once, as he has information that the bu T
bonic plague rages here and the city is to be quaran
tined by the rest of the country. A telegram of that
kind from such a source shows the alarm that has
been excited in the East by the sensational and reck
less action taken by the Board of Health here. San
Francisco is to be shunned as if it were a pestilential
place, instead of being, as it is, one of the healthiest
localities in the world.
Another illustration of the readiness with which
6uch reports are exaggerated is at hand in a circular
from Grants Pass, Or., protesting against reports that
smallpox is raging in that locality., The circular
says: "We hear that in some places we are credited
with having a number of cases reaching into the hun
dreds, and that we are dying at a rapid rate; One of
our neighboring towns gives the information that our
militia has been called out to preserve the quarantine.
Another has officiously quarantined against us. The
true state of affairs is this: At the present time there
are two very mild cases nearly recovered. * *'",*
The cases are in the outskirts of the town and the
houses are isolated. * * * There is no excitement
or agitation here, nor any reason for any. The ut
ter ridiculousness of the circulated reports gives rea
son for the belief that they are circulated by rival
towns for the purpose of injuring our trade, and
while we hesitate to ascribe a motive so contemptible,
we can imagine no other cause for the persistent cir
culation of utter and complete falsehood."
It will not be necessary to attribute jealousy to the
circulators of the injurious reports concerning San
Francisco in order to explain their action. When our
own Board of Health makes a tremendous display of
quarantining a large section of the city, and its or
gan issues something like a "bubonic edition" to jus
tify the action, it is inevitable that outsiders should
deem our city infected like some port of the Orient
and proceed to establish a rigid quarantine against it.
The evil has been done, and we must take the con
sequences, but the public should bear in mind the
authors of the scare and let them feel the force of
popular indignation.

As a matter of fact, a room to be used

dark-room work at night. The bathroom

plenty of shelf accommodation for stor

sheets of white paper. This will enable
you to see the articles much better in the
dim light of the dark room.
Now as to the utensils required. There

with a shelf outside to hold a lamp, as
previously ' suggested, you will merely
need the necessary panes of glass of the
correct tint. It has been found most ad

this a sheet of deep orange glass. This

convenient and several well washed bot

A -comfortable stool or chair placed be

canister to receive papers, strings, burned

dark-room essentials, though some other

New Business Block.
The trustees of the estate and guardians
of the minor children of Charles F.
Crocker, 'deceased, will soon erect a fine
business block on the land owned by the
estate fronting upon Fremont. Mission
and First streets. No plans have been
adopted, the reason being that the guar
dians are first seeking tenants so that
the income may be insured In advance.
The tract of land is quite large for a
building site, being 137:6 on Mission street,
187:6 on First street and BO feet on Fre
mont street. The frontage of fifty feet
extends through from Fremont street to
First street. One of the parties having
the matter In charge said yesterday that
the building will be arranged for Btorea.
The size of the structure and the other
details have not yet been decided upon.
The land is now occupied by a number of

Permanent Organization of

Is Effected. ;
Irving M. Scott Is Elected Perma
nent Chairman and President
Wheeler Speaks of His
Eastern Trip^
The finance committee' of tho Pacific
Commercial Museum met yesterday after
noon in the rooms of the Board of Trade
and formed a permanent organization.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California was in the chair.
Before the business of, the day came up
In regular order Professor Wheeler, upon
the unanimous request of the members
present, told of his trip, East, his meeting
with President McKlnley and Sedretary'
Hay, of his efforts in behalf of the local
venture and the glowing .prospects of a
successful termination of the plans for
a Pacific commercial museum. Professor
Wheeler while In Philadelphia visited the
Philadelphia Commercial Museum and
spent much time with its officers. He has
been furnished duplicates of many valu
able records which are in the Eastern
museum and which took several years to
collect and order.
Â¦ Professor Plehn, secretary of the finance
committee, reported that he had commu
nicated with all the Congressmen and
Senators of this State, and their replies
speak for an active and helpful disposi
tion on the part of California's national
representatives. Congressman Barham in
particular, who is a member of the Com
merce Committee, pledged that he would
ask for an amendment for a $50,000 appro
priation to the original $200,000 bill In be
half of the Philadelphia Museum, the add
ed amount to go to the California project.
Should the committee fall to report this
measure he will introduce a bill for the
benefit of the California museum.
By resolution it was ordered that a
nominating committee be appointed to
select officers of the finance- committee
and members of the executive committee.
Professor Wheeler appointed W. R.
Wheeler, â¢ Rufua Jennings and Ebenezer
Scott.
The nominating committee then with
drew, and after a few minutes submitted
a report which was unanimously adopted.
For chairman of the finance committee
Irving M. Scott was named; for secre
tary # C. C. Plehn. For members of the
executive committee the following were
selected: Mayor. James D. Phelan, A. A.
Watkins. .George A. Newhall, Isaac Up
ham, Charles Tlolbrook, Rufus P. Jen
nings, M. H. de Young, A. M. Lawrence,
John D. Spreckels. A further recommen
dation of the nominating committee was
that the chairman of the promotion com
mittee be made a member of the execu
tive committee, and. also" that five mem
bers of the executive committee shall con
stitute a quorum.
Â¦ Professor Wheeler then relinquished the
chair to Irving M. Scott, who, after a few
remarks, asked to be relieved from the
duties of his new position for, the day, as
as he was suffering from a severe cold.
President Wheeler again took the chair.
The report of the nominating committee
â¢Was afterward supplemented by the nomi
nation of the Bank of California as treas
urer.
Professor Davidson was called upon to
explain the purposes and the general
character of the museum. Others spoke
at length upon the subject, covering the
entire scope of the new venture."
A letter was read from the secretary of
the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, in
which It was asked that the finance com
mittee call for a general . convention of
representatives of the Â¦ various chambers
of commerce in the big cities. This mat
ter was submitted to the executive com
mittee for further consideration.

The transports Leelanaw and Cone
maugh discharged their cargoes of mules
at Hilo while en route, to Manila. While
the vessels were at anchor the officers of
both were banqueted by the townspepople.
and a most enjoyable time resulted.
The officers of the Hongkong Maru re
port that the cook of the bark Annie John
son jumped overboard when the vessel
was two days out from Hilo. The Annie
Johnson was hove to and a boat lowered,
but no trace of the suicide could be found.
The bark Is expected to arrive here dally.
The new steamer Rainier arrived from
Grays Harbor yesterday In tow of the tuÂ«r.
Astoria. As soon as the cargo of lumber
in her hold is discharged she will be cn
glned and fitted out and will then sail for
Nome under the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's flag.
Shipping men are viewing with conster
nation the fact that another big raft is
being built on Puget Sound to be towed to
San Francisco. In this giant affair "there
will be 14,000,000 feet of lumber, and shoul 1
It ever go to pieces destruction will surely
follow In Its path. Of all the menaces to
navigation there Is nothing that can com
pare with a derelict log raft.
There Is not a vacant berth for phlps
along the front, and Chief Wharfinger
Henderson and Assistant Chief Dryden
are at their wit's end to know where to
place the various vessels applying for ac
commodation. The widening and extend
ing of the wharves along the front has
begun none too soon, as the demand for
space now exceeds the limit of the ac
commodation.

For the opening of plates and the filling
of the holders and for the chemical ma
nipulation after exposure, a room per
fectly free from all light is required. The
light with which to see when performing
the various operations must come' through
a pane of ruby glass or a sheet of ruby
fabric from outside of the room, or It
must be from the flam* of a lantern made
for the purpose.
It Is best, when possible, to have a
room used' exclusively for this purpose.
It need not be large, though the larger
and more airy the better. Almost every
house has a room or closet which will
answer. If nowhere else, a dry and well
cemented corner of the cellar will be
found to be a good place, as it will be
cool In summer and usually free from In
trusion. Around the two open sides can
be constructed a wall of ordinary flooring
or weather boarding nailed to uprights,
with a door at the farthest corner from
where you Intend developing. In build
ing a room it would be well to build a
small shelf supported by a bracket on
the outside, with a small window fitted
with a frame of ruby glass extending nip
from the shelf. A lamp on the shelf will
Illuminate the dark room and keep the
heat outside and save the trouble of a
ruby lantern. It should be built at the
same height as the developing table In
side. The room can be ventilated In the
following manner: Have made at the

isfactory. Another pane of ruby glass, or
a sheet of ruby fabric, should be added to
the others to make the light perfectly
safe. The best size for the window Is 8
by 10 or 10 by 13, and It should be directly
In front of the developing table. If there
Is not a window of this kind a ruby lan
tern will be necessary. This should be a
good one, burning oil. Much of the suc
cess of developing depends on a good, safe
llKht, and a few extra dollars spent here
will be money saved. The very cheap lan
terns are invariably unsatisfactory. They
have an insufficient draft, become over
heated and the solder melts or the glass
cracks. The lamp shown in the Illustra
tion gives a safe 8 by 10 ruby light for
developing by. while the left side door
when open emits a clear white light for
making transparencies and bromide prints
by contact. The right door when open
gives a soft opal light for examining neg
atives or transparencies. The lantern Is
generally fitted with a coal oil lamp and
silvered reflector, but can be readily
adapted to the use of gas or of electric
light.
At least three trays will be required
one shallow, the same size as the plate
you work, and the others deeper and a
size larger. The first Is for the developer,
and should be of hard rubber or papier
mache. The others are for the other solu
tions that we shall need and if we do not
have a fixing box we shall need a tray for
fixing, large enough to take several plates.
This latter may be of any material. Bach
tray should be marked by writing Its use
on a piece of paper and gluing the paper
to the end of the tray. When it has
dried It should be well rubbed with vas
eline or varnished to render It waterproof.
These trays must never be used for any
purpose other than that for which they
are marked. For fixing, however, a reg-

London Market.
NEW YORK. March 22.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was little Increase in general business
in the market here to-day and the tone . was
Irregular. Americans were strong, being an
exception to the rule. They were also more
active than for many months. London bought
steadily and big orders came from Berlin,
Amsterdam and Brussels. New York bought
also and the close was booming, with Balti
more and Ohio the leading feature. Country
support waa apparently influenced by an Econ
omist article pointing out that a new era has
been inaugurated by the currency law, but big
brokers have been "dipping" the rise for some
days. Tintos . spurted to 654 on the dividend
of 45 shillings and the showing of Â£30,000
brought forward and Â£HO,OOO added to the re
serve. This was fully up to well-informed ex
pectation, although under optimistic estimates
about .ten days ago. Anacondas were slightly
harder in sympathy. The Bank of England
bought Â£33,000 gold In bars and reduced Its
buying price to the statutory minimum of 77s
Sd. Money sales were unchanged and half
the amount due the Bank of England was re
paid. Paris cheque. 25.22: Berlin. 20.49.

FRIDAY. MARCH 23.
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, March 23.â The railroad stocks
bad their Inning on the Stock Exchange to
day. The demand for all grades of this claes
of eecm-ltles reached Imposing proportions and
the buying came from all degrees of investors
and speculators, large and small. The Indi
vidual Investor wu In evidence as a buyer of
fractional lots all through the lift and some
of the heavy buying was attributed to the ac
count of banking interests and insiders in the
various properties. The profepslon&l board
room traders on the floor of the exchange have
turned bulls to a man and the speculators of
larger caliber and speculative pools made their
operations manifest in the volume of transac
tions. Individual trÂ«r>Kactlorut to the extent
of 1000 shares were so usual as to attract little
attention, while many lota of 2000 to 5300 were
recorded on the tape. Norfolk and Western
and the Atchlson flocks took the most con-
Fpicuous place in the trading, but there were
Impressive transactions at different times dur
ing the day in Union Pacific. Baltimore and
Ohio. Southern Pacific. Pennsylvania. Northern
Pacific. Chesapeake and Ohio and late In the
Cay Southern Railway. The strength disclosed
In yesterday's market precipitated to-day's
rush to buy and it was made clear that a very
large element must have been waiting and
watching aoroe time for the Bret sign that the
market was throwing off its lethargy and
retting ready to jump. In studying to-day's
market it Is worthy of close attention that
the rush to buy was taken advantage if to
take profits en a very large scale in stocks
which have recently enjoyed a considerable ad
vance under manipulation by professional oper
ators and pools. Practically all of the indus
trial etocka. including the local tractions and
the Iron and steel stocks and also sugar, were
sold to take profits under cover of the specu
lative furor. It was not only in the mer
curial specialties that this process was in evl
dence, but also in the railroad list itself.
Baltlmtre and Ohio and the Pacific stocks
showed its effects very distinctly. Union Pa
cific was advanced early and was held pretty
steady at the advance all day. but it made uo
notable further progmus upward and the stocks
in this category showed posltU-e reaction. But
the current of the buying demand was no
<seep and strong as to carry the whole market I
practically In its sweep. Commission houses
reported orders on a large ncale and London
wan an eaÂ«er buyer of storks here far beyunj
the usual hour when transactions for that ac
count have ceased. The volume of buying for
this account was â¢ estimated at from C&.bOO to
70.000 shares and was a potent infl'Jtnc* in
the general strength of the market, l^cndon
c&bles reported that part of the bu>ing of
Americans there was for Berlin account. A
flurry in call money in the afternoon to* 6 pÂ»r
cent wsa an admonitory symptom, prompting
the reJWtlcn that even the relaxed condi
tions :n the money market might be over-
Ftralned again by a headlong speculation. A
<lro;Â» in New York exchange at Chicago to 20
cent* discount, compared with 25 cenu pre
mium earlier in the week,' pointed the same
moral. Government bonds were also checked
In their downward course to-day and rallied
Indicating that the profit-taking there whl.:h
wiui a factor in releasing funds to the ,r.on-y
market has come to a pause and although the
Â«Ã¼b-treaÂ«ury absorption is cut alir.rst in half
as rornjjun-l with last week it still promiM-s
to run up close to the amount of the surplus
y< remaining with the banks over Ihe ie
quired 25 per cent. Probabiy k. perception of
t>ieÂ«e facts, as well as the violence of Ihe
day's advance, prompted the general move
ment to take, profits in the late fleallngs, which

Northern Wheat Market.
OREGON.
PORTLAND, March 22.â The local wheat
market Is easier in tone in sympathy with
other markets. It is a somewhat uiwsual fact
for this market to exhibit any sympathy with
other markets, but this Is apparently what it
was doing to-day, as but few of the exporters
were quoting over 63c, which is supposed to be
somewhat nearer the export value. This price
will not move much wheat and a small sale
was reported at 54c, with 53@54c being bid for
some choice' valley. Bluestem. We.

NOW A FIGHT TO OUST
LAWYER GOODFELLOW
Counter Demonstration From Forces of
Bishop and Wheeler/
Charges Against Attorney Earl Declared to Have
Been Annulled by the Admissions of the
Accusing Counselors. ' Â«
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 22.
\\ 'W UIIXTU llXT a PP earG< l to be a mere eklr
' W\// mi6h beiween the opposing coun
\f^ sel In the Varney trust contest
has developed into a veritable
l>attle-royal between giants in thÂ« legal
profession of this State. The general en
gagement was precipitated to-day during
the hearing of Attorney W. S. Goodfel
kiw'o charges against Attorney Guy C.
Karl of the firm of Bishop & Wheeler.
Sensation after sensation was developed
and the climax to the day of fighting was
in the notice which Mr. Wheeler gave
that he would move to have Mr. Goodfel
low disqualified from appearing for the
' truetee* upon the ground that he was act
ing in the same dual role of standing on
both tildes of the case which he had Im
puted to the firm of Bishop & Wheelet.
Besides that. Mr. Wheeler declared that
his antagonist has practically withdrawn
liis accusations against Senator Earl by
admitting that the Varney case had been
taken to the firm of Bishop & Wheeler
through the independent action of "Attor
ney Treat. He declared the withdrawal
should be accompanied by an apology,
which Mr. Goodfellow refused to give,
reiterating his allegation and throwing
<iown the srauntlet lor a continuance of
the struggle.
Attorney Goodfellow announced that
he would withdraw as counsel for T. H.
Is. Varney in the latter's Individual capac
ity, but he proposed to fight out his posi
tion as the counsel for the trustee*.
Mr. Wheeler went to the attack upon
Good fellow with the opening of court this
morning. He placed his opponent on the
witness stand and went into a lengthy
examination concerning Goodfellow's re
lations &f attorney for the trustees and
the Varney eetat*. Goodfellow said he
had declined to appear In the suit of
Trustees Pitcher and Taylor against
Trustee Varney to recover the $23,000 there
at Issue because he was counsel for all of
the trustees and the estate. It was shown
that the present suit is one of heirs and
beneficiaries under Thomas Varney's will
against the trustees. During the exami
nation Judge Ogden asked Attorney Good
fellow:
"Yeu appear for the whole estate and
the heirs also, do you not?"
"Yes. I represent the entire estate." re
plied Goodfellow.
"Then. I take It," declared Judge Og
den, "that If Bishop & Wheeler are dis
qualified In this case you also would be
oipQUÃiifled. In the. former case you rep
r*e<yned the trustees and the estate. In
the present action you are appearing"
against the heirs end beneficiaries."
Â¦ "If the court holds that view of the.
rase I am willing to withdraw. If your
Honors will consult upon the matter I
will be Fatssfied if all of the attorneys are
unqualified."
After Goodfellow said he wor.!d not rep
resent Trustee Varney in the tatter's in
dividual capacity because of the 123,000
pending John W. Varney corroborated
Attorney Treat's statement of the way he
was given clarge nf the litigation for the
lieirp. Attorney William Rlx, also asso
ciated with the firm of Bishop & Wheeler,
testified he would be in the-contest.
After the coon recess the attorneys went
to anrument. Mr. Goodfellow dwelt at
length upon the strict rules laid down by
the Supreme Court for the conduct of at
torneys and Bald: "If they were'observed
there would be a higher standard of mor
ality at th* bar than now exists."
He contended that he had shown that
Attorney Earl's position justified his
charges and then added:
"I am pleased to hear of Mr. Treat's
ronneetlcn v/Uh th<? case. He came into
It independently, and I believe It woulfl

THE LATE VOL.NET ASHFORD.
, Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 22.
Volney V. Ashford, who died in this city
last evening, was 'a man I most intimately
connected with Hawaiian history and with
his death closed a remarkable career. ,
Volney V." Ashford was born at Port
Hope/ Canada,' fifty-three years ago. Early
in his youtrr he ' went ' to New York and
took -up the study of law. -He served, In
the Twenty-first New, York Regiment of
Cavalry in the ' civil war and was honor
ably discharged in September, 1865, as a
second lieutenant," when but IS. years old.
In 18S4 he went to Honolulu, where his
brother, Clarence W. Ashford, had been
practicing law for , several years. : There
his capabilities were . recognized by King
Kalakaua, who presented him with letters
of denization and shortly afterward made
him the royal legal adviser. Ashfdrd was
an important factor in the first revolution
in Hawaii In 1886. when Wilcox was striv
ing to overthrow the reign and govern
ment of King Kalakaua.; He was organ
izer of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia com
pany, composed of Americans and English
men, and was for some time colonel com
manding of the Hawaiian- army. - It" was
to him that , Wilcox finally surrendered.
In 1890, when Liliuokalani was In power,
there was < another., uprising and Ashford
always }. afterward i claimed that during
that insurrection he intended carrying out
the very plans that * Dole since executed.
Ashford, even iin' his last' days/ declared
that Dole had -proved traitor to him and
his cause; had betrayed his confidence and
exposed hls'plans.'; ThecQueen, at that
time.t was made $ aware of Ashf ord's mo
tives, and threatened - to. have him. be
headed,, but influential friends : interceded
and managed to smuggle him away from

HOLD UP AND SEARCH
CHINESE MERCHANTS
Consul General Ho Vow Protests to
Commissioners' Against Summary
Action of the Police. -
Attorney Bennett, acting for the Chi

filed a complaint which will lead to a test
case to ascertain If^Chinese can be held
up in the streets and searched for lottery
tickets and other evidences of gambling.
A-merchant named Mow, whose place of
business Is on Commercial street, claims
that recently he was held up and searched
by an officer while he was en route to
the Customs-house with' papers from the
Consul. .
Complaint has been made to the Po
lice Commissioners,' and later the matter
will be tested in the courts. The Chinese
claim protection on. constitutional grounds
and say that the provision declaring that
there shall be no. unreasonable search is
sufficient to prevent the officers - from
standing them up in the streets without
search warrants.- Â¦
UNITED WORKMEN
MUST PAY THE CLAIM
Judge Belcher Decides Rigby's Suit
Brought to Test Validity
of a By-Law. .
Jndge Belcher yesterday rendered judg
ment in favor of W. Rigby Jr. and against
the Grand Lodge. Ancient Order of United
Workmen, of California. . Rigby sued
the order to recover on a policy held by
William McLaughlin, a deceased member.
The order refused to pay the policy on the
ground that McLaughlin had engaged in
the occupation of selling intoxicating
liquors some time before his death, which
was contrary to the by-laws of the order.
Judge BelchÂ«*r holds that at the time Mc-
Laughlin joined the order the by-laws did
not prohibit a member from engaging in
the liquor bu?iness, and furthermore thai
as the laws of the State do not prohibit
the selling of liquor the defendant order
had no right to tack on a condition that
would have the effect to cancel its obli
gation. Judgment was therefore entered
in favor of the plaintiff.

eomewhat painful.: Even the worm will turn, and no
sooner had the Assessor opened up his batteries of ridi
cule than he was seized and thrown on the floor and held
there while "the Coroner cut away one half of the Dalton
lip decoration. - But the mustache clipping did not stop
there. The Elks realized that Dr. Halsey and H. S. Pugh
were becoming somewhat vain, and they were â¢ similarly
shorn. j
The Coroner was In high' glee over the sweeping suc
cess of his campaign of vengeance ,'but his mirth was
shortlived, for his three victims suddenly united against
the common enemy, and while two of them held him the
third cut his hair in the most approved Indian scalping
style. â¢;:; .;. ; "â¢Â¦; V . â¢Â¦Â¦'. -â¢' Â¦-â¢ Â¦Â¦
Â¦ Assessor Dalton swears he will be still further
revenged; that he will make the Coroner pay double poll
tax. The Coroner retaliates by saying he has the last
drop on all men, and the others should beware..
be perfectly right ior him to go on but
JÂ°r the contract he has with Bishop <&
\\ heeler and the heirs. To my mind he
Is disqualified. So long as that contract
exists chere is a temptation to furnish
confidential information."
Attorney Goodfellow quoted from a de
cision of the Supreme Court in the case
ot 3. F. Cowdery and D. H. Whittemoro,
who were disbarred. In replying Mr.
Wheeler said:
At the outset 1 desire to say that it
may ue conceded we agree on principles
or law; that an attorney employed on one
side of a controversy cannot cross over
and take the cause of the other side Is too
clear to require argument. The man who
would announce to the contrary would be
guilty cf such moral turpitude that he
ought to be disbarred. If there be any
analogy between the present case and
those of Cowdery and Whittemore there
is only one duty for us. I and the gentle
men with me have sufficient regard for
our profession to know that duty and to
act. But there is nothing analogous, and
to the credit of the American bar no at
torney has ever before made such charges
as have been made here upon the facts as
they exist."
Mr. Wheeler directed attention to the
statement of his opponent that Mr.
Treat was independently connected with
earing the Varney estate. He said:
There was an outrageous insinuation
and imputation that Mr. Earl had
drummed up this case, made yesterday
by Mr. Goodfellow. The imputation has
not t J? en Publ'cly withdrawn, although
Mr. Goodfellow Is to-day satisfied with
jtne way the case came to our hands,
xhls has not been accompanied by apol
ogy due from one member of the profes
sion to the other as we see it."
"He swore that his theory of the case
was that I had given information upon
which the Varney estate contest was
brought, interrupted Attorney Earl.
"I said that it was inferential," Inter
jected Mr. Goodfellow: "that my examina
tion showed that Mr. Earl had known
about the case a year before Treat
got it."
"\o\x did Insinuate that the information
came from Mr. Earl and that the case
was drummed up by him," repeated Mr.
W heeler.
"I did so by Inference." said Goodfel
low.
"To-day you say Mr. Treat obtained
the case independently and yet you make
no public apology," declared Mr. Wheeler.
'I have none to make; I stand on the
record," replied Attorney Goodfellow.
"Remember, gentlemen," was Judge
Ogdtr'B warning, "It was understood
that you were not to bring your animosi
ties, if any there be, into the courtroom."
With the conclusion of the argument
Mr. Wheeler maintained there was
not a scintilla of evidence to Fhow
that anything confidential had been dis
closed or that there was a particle of
irregularity in the handling of the case
by his firm or any of its connections.
Just before court rose. Mr. Wheeler,
with some sarcasm, said: "In order that
no advantage be taken of Mr. Goodfellow
I desire now to give notice that I will
move to have him disqualified as attorney
for the trustees in this suit upon grounds
which I will later present to the court."
"I think I should know the grounds,''
said Attorney Goodfellow.
Stating the proposition, Mr. Wheeler
said he would maintain that Goodfellow
was In a double capacity because he was
defending the trustees in one case against
the beneficiaries and heirs who were in
terested in the estate of which he was
also the attorney.
BERKELEY. March 22.â E. E. Nichols,
principal of the Lorin Grammar School,
was arrested this afternoon on a charge
of battery for whipping three of his pu
pils. He punished the children with' a
heavy strapâ a piece of old harness trace
âuntil he raised black and blue marks on
their legs. ' . - ,i .
Last Tuesday^ Raymond Rasmussen,
Irving Waterbufy and young Richter
were sent from the classroom by their
teacher to Principal Nichols for a trifling
infraction of the rules.
The boys are about 11 years old and
members of the fifth grade. They had
been throwing feathers with corks and
pins attached to the ceiling, to "the
amusement of the rest of the class, and
were dismissed from the class and told to
report to the principal.
Nichols severely punished the lads with
a heavy strap, two and a half inches wide
and a quarter of an inch .thick, using it
double. He beat the boys about the legs
until young Rasmussen could hardly
stand.
As soon as he got home that evening
he told his parents. They examined him
and found a number of black and blue
welts on the thighs of their son. Imme
diately the father, James A. Rasmussen,
He Is Charged With Having Beaten the Boys Until
They Were Black and Blue, but Says He
Was Not Cruel.
reported the whipping to the police, with
the result that Principal Nichols was ar
rested this atternoon. The fathers of the
other two boys complained to the Super
intendent of Schools.
Nichols says that he did not unduly
punish the children. While- they com
mitted what might be called a serious in
fraction of school rules, he, did not Intend
In any way to maltreat them. He says
the strap used was about the same as is
generally used throughout the school de
partment. He did not. he says, exert un
due force In reprimanding 1 the lads ana
believes he will be fully exonerated by
his evidence. Â¦ . - .
Marshal LJoyd, who did the arresting,
said:
"I have known Nichols for some tlm* x
and always thought well of him. The
strap he used in punishing the boys Â¦was
altogether too heavy. The boys are very
young and did not require as severe a
punishment as was given them to discip
line them. The fathers complained to the
School Department and Mr. Raamussen
signed the complaint for the arrest of
Nichols. He says he examined his son
and found large blue marks where the
strap had left its Imprint."
Nichols was allowed to go on his own
recognizance this afternoon by Justice
Edgar. The case will come up next Satur
day morning at 10 o'clock.

CONSTELLATOR A
COLT OF CLASS
WHEN JUST FIT
Won the Handicap at Tan
foran Galloping From
Some Fair Ones.
Bollick Downed His Field in the
Two- Year-Old Scrambleâ Forte
Is Beaten Out by
"Weller.
The Elmwood farm's three-year-old
Constellator. carrying 19 pounds, disposed
of some average racing hardware in rag
time at Tanroran yesterday. His close
second to Ventcro some days ago had ap
parently beÂ«n overlooked, for 8 to 1 was
freely offered about him in the betting- on
the mile handicap. Johnny Ranch, . who
had the leg up, got away from the post
next to last on the outside, but showed In
front soon after turning Into the back
stretch. From that on it was only a ques
tion as to the place horse. Daisy F, the fa
vorite, securing the position three lengths
before Erwln. Jack Martin, on the latter,
indulged in considerable rough riding, for
which his mount was disqualified and
show honors given to The Fretter.
A perfect gale blew over the course,
rocking the grandstand and greatly re
tarding the progress of the horses In the
sail home. Favorites managed to annex
three purses.
The fast but unlucky Combermere was
again made favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, and once more finished second.
Cut off right after the start, he reached
the wire In time to be beaten a length by
Rollick, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
ridden by Shields. Floranthe, at 50 to 1.
ran a good third.
- Corrigan's sprinter Afghan closed equal
favorite with Peace for the six-furlong
sprint, after at one time ruling choice In
the betting. Henry on Peace outbroke the
bunch, winning all the way. Olinthu3 fin
ished third, behind Afghan. The fir3t
named horse was disqualified and Jennie
Reid placed third.
A squad of four lined up for Inspection
in the mile and three furlongs selling af
fair, with Catastrophe a topheavy choice.
Topmast and Twlnkler were backed to
some extent, but indulged In a fruitless
chase from the start. Henry on the cholca
made all the pace, beating out Toprcast
very cleverly, while Twinkler ran last be
hind Tappan.
, With only five starting In the two-milo
event Barney Schrelber's Forte was looked
upon as a certainty. After cutting out all
the running he had his colors lowered by
Weller, the second choice, piloted by
Powell and well backed. Tom Calvcrt
"showed."
For the final mile run Flamora, the fa
vorite, proved an easy winner over Dr.
Nembula.
Track Notes.
After his rides on Olinthus and Enrln
the Judges suspended Jack Martin for
thirty days. Both of the horses men
tioned were disqualified for show honors.
In Â¦Weller, Marley Klttleman has a very
likely candidate for the Thornton stcke.
A mild "killlngr" was made on the horse
yesterday. . .
Henry, who Is now the kingpin, piloted
three winners yesterday.
Charley Thorpe was reported as resting
easily after his severe accident on
Wednesday, but will be seen In the saddle
here no more this season.

MISS SKYROCKET
WON THE STAKE
AT INGLESIDE
False Flatterer Was Runner
Up After Winning Some
Good Courses.
Shortenders Made a Good Showing
and Captured Eighteen Out of
Fifty-Six Buns, Some at
Good Odds.
The midweek stake at Ingleside Cours
ing Park . yesterday was a great one for
the short ends, the favorites being bowled
over in no less, than eighteen of the flfty-
Eix courses run. The day's programme
was a long drawn out affair owing to the
many undecided course* and "no goes,"
at least twenty hares which refused to
take straight runs being driven to ths
escapes.
The attendance was large for a midweek
stake, and the regulars were treated to a
good card, in which the courses were
close and nearly even almost throughout.
False Flatterer in the third tie beat Hur
ricane after a no go, and in the next tie
beat Twin City Girl, a 3 to 1 favorite, in a

MUNICIPAL PURCHASE
OF PUBLIC UTILITIES
Supervisors Decide to Question Rep
resentatives of Local Corpora- â¢
tions in Reference to the
Sale of Their Plants.
On next Thursday night the corpora
tions that supply light, water, telephone
and other public necessities will be asked
by the Public Utilities Committee of the
Board of Supervisors to tell for what
price they will sell their plants to the
city. The committee met last night to
discuss the problem of municipal owner
ship of public utilities.
Charles Wesley Reed presided, and the
only other member of the committee pres
ent was Supervisor Maguire. In answer
to a request City Engineer Grunsky ap
peared with an advertisement asking for
bids on a water supply for the city. This
advertisement led to an Informal discus
sion of a city water supply and of the six
mountain supplies which from time to
time have been suggested. Mr. Grunsky
was asked also to prepare advertisements
covering the telephone and public lighting
demands. He will submit his suggestions
at the next meeting of the committee.
It was decided last night to send invita
tions to the Independent Electric Light
end Power Company and to the Standard
E'jÂ»ctric Company to have representatives
at the next meeting of the committee. The
Supervisors want to know what these
corporations will charge to supply the city
with power In one instance water In
another. This meeting will be therefore
of considerable importance, as it will in
dicate more definitely than any other
what the cost of purchasing public utili
ties may be to the people of the city.

TH*E SAN FRAN CISCO CALL., FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 1900.
HEALTH OFFICER
REPORTS DEMISE
OF MOTHER RUT
Inspectors Making a Clean
ing Tour Through the
Chinese District.
Three Deaths of the Second Plague
Scare Are Said to Have Been
Caused by the Beal
Thing.
New religious rites have been forced
upon the Chinese of San Francisco by our
"next to godly" Health Board. When
ever a Celestial goes to the realm beyond
nowadays a sacrifice is prepared for him
by the health authorities and a rat, mon
key or guinea-pig dies upon the altar of
science for the absolution of the Mon
golian foul.
The three Chinese who left the earth for
parts unknown and provoked the second
plague scare by reason of their "suspicious
deaths" were afflicted with a disease
which the bacteriologists of the Health
Board seem to think is the "real thing."
At any rate, the menagerie at Angel
Island was put in requisition, dosed with
bacilli especially extracted from the Mon
golians and watched by the learned phy
sicians with a care that is only exceeded
by their zeal. Word came from Angel
Island .yesterday that another inoculated
rat succumbed to the treatment inflicted
upon him. The rest of the menaperie is
suffering travail from loss of appetite and
Injectlonal disorders.
Chinatown is no lonper what it was
since the Health Board began its arduous
labors. With the fifty extra policemen,
an army of health Inspectors and filth ex
terminators on the rampage and physi
cians ready to examine any Chinese who
stumbles across their pathway, there is
life and activity In that district at the
present time. Garbaee by the ton is being
turned to ashes, while the smell of disin
fectants is playing a strong second to the
old characteristic odor that was thourht
to be Inseparable from the quarter. The
Inhabitants of Chinatown do not like the
indignities they are subjected to, yet
they offer little resistance and in many
cases do some of the cleaning without
much objection.
If the scare does not soon die out there
will be a sweeping epidemic of health
boards. In another day the Federal,
State and city officers will be having a
love feast, and for once in their respective
careers harmony will prevail. Dr. W. P,
Matthews of the State Board arrived from
Sacramento yesterday and was in con
sultation with Dr. Williamson of the local
board. The State authorities will tele
graph to all the country health boards
and urpe their members to use precau
tionary measures against the Introduction
of the plague.

Among the 256 Japanese immigrants who
arrived on the Hongkong Maru only one
was denied a landing. He is Heisaburd

INSANE JAPANESE GIVES
DE LA T ORRE A SCARE
Wanted to Look at an Automobile,
and the Officer Thought He
Meditated Assault.
The steamer Colon brought In Tuesday
an insane Japanese passenger, who wai
turned' over to . the Immigration Commis
sioners. The long-haired, bewhlskercd
and wild-eyed. lndividual was assigned to
Deputy A. de la Torre for deliverance to
the Japanese consul, as he had brought
with him a letter from the American con
bul at Mazatlan. Mexico, containing 'n
structions to that effect.
De la Torre â¢ cautiously handed his
charge into the official immigration, car
riage and courageously followed him.
The drive to the consul's office was beset
with misgivings on the part of the officer,
but he did his duty bravely with one
hand on his hip pocket and an eye alert
for indications of. violence. ?
Once the insane, immigrant made a
movement as- . if .to begin . hostilities. : hin
long hair flying to the March breeze and
his wild eyes glaring fiercely. De
Torre thought it was all up with bsm.
but he intended to be faithful to his
service. Grasping his revolver and flash
ing his authoritative star, he Jumped -to
his feet and commanded the Jap. In terri
fying Spanish, to be seated. The effect
was Instantaneous. The cowed maniac
sank back In his seat subdued, only mut
tering "Me like see wagon/ no hosse. A
festive' automobile' had occasioned -the
outbreak. : .. ' . .
No further trouble occurred, but It was
with some relief that the brave officer
delivered his charge into the hands of the
consul, who is now endeavoring to dispose
of his guest.' By reason of having been an
American seaman at the time of ;lapÂ«.lni<
Into Insanity, the Jap Is a burden on the
United States Government and must . b.
entertained until arrangements can be
made for shipping him back to the Orient.
SCAVENGERS ARE
FORCED TO OBEY
CITY ORDINANCE
Attorney Waits on Chief of
Police and Promises
Compliance. Â¦; .
Sample Closed Cart 'for Transporta
tion of Garbage Will Be Sub
mitted in a Few Days for
Official Approval.
There will be no more uncovered scav
enger carts in the streets of San Fran
cisco. That was the substance of .an
agreement presented by the attorney of
tho Scavengers' Protective Union, .Ed
ward B. Learning, in an Interview sought
by him yesterday morning with Chief of
Police Sullivan. The events of the past
few days' have convinced the scavengers
that they can no longer openly defy the
law, which provides that they shall use
only Vovered carts , in conveying garbage
and refuse through the., streets. Mr.
Learning consulted with the Chief and
the result was that the police did not ar
rest any scavengers yesterday.
: Mr. Learning said- that the Scavengers'
Protective Union had instructed him to
promise- that" the" scavengers would be
willing' to dp anything necessary Â¦ to con
form to the law. .; In order to show that
they were in earnest, Mr. Learning said
the scavengers were, having' a" cart pre
pared to be submitted . for the ; approval
of. the authorities. Â¦' If â¢ this proves to be
satisfactory, the scavengers will be pro
vided with similar outfits, at once. Chief
Sullivan announced that he had no desire
to -persecute the scavengers.^ Â¦--'Â¦
\ There were nine cases against as many
scavengers which were to ' have come
up yesterday in the Police Courts,
but at the request of the Chief
Of Police, they all went over for one week,
the understanding . being that -the pro
posed covered scavenger 'cart should be

AL NEILL THE VICTOR

McCcnneil Shows Marked
Improvement, bui Meets
His Master.

Defensive Fighter and Too

Â¦ >
BOXER AL NEILL defeated Frank
McConnell last night in the arena
of the Columbia Athletic Club,
at Woodward's Pavilion, after a
scientific battle of eight rounds. The vic
tor showed marvelous cleverness as a
defensive fighter, blocking and ducking
blows which meant defeat and oblivion
if landed. For the vanquished the spec
tators had nothing* but praise. He showed
the remarkable improvement made in his
style by his fighting pilgrimage to the
East, but his blows did not have the
sting in them which his adversary's pos
sessed.
The gong seemed to save McConnell at
the end of the second round and hgaln at
the end of the sixth. In the first Instance
a right on the Jaw sent him staggering,
while In the second a smash on the body,
followed quickly by one on the head, took
all the fight out of him. It was this cruel
body blow, supplemented by others, which
was the undoing of McConnell. They took
all the pugnacity out of him, so that once
he started on the down grade to defeat
his descent was rapid. A broken rib, sus
tained In one of nls fights In the East,
left a weak spot which could not with
stand the blows which Neill landed on
that portion of his body.
The end came unexpectedly in the eighth
round. The men and been fighting ncaily

he stepped in quickly and fought McCon- ,

SOLACE TO CHANGE
FROM NAVY TO ARMY
Hospital Ship to Be Taken Into the
Transport , Service â Another
Prisoner Escapes.
The army has been casting a covetous,
eye at the naval hospital ship Solace, and
as the navy does not care particularly to
keep her, it is next to certain that she
be transferred from one service to the
other. Â¦
She will make a fine hospital ship, for
she was fitted up with ' the best a hos
pital ship needs. There never has been
any scandal about her and she has not
cost the Government any more than a
reasonable purchase price and a fair bill
for repairs. A board of survey, which
will Include Colonel Bird, the head of
the army transport service, will visit
Mare Island this week and the ship will
be gone over. If found satisfactory she
will be turned over to the army, and, aa
Bhe has never had any criticism, it is cer.
tain she will meet with favor. , '
, The Badger, which will also be turned
over from the navy to the army, will re
ceive inspection by the same board. She,
too, has always proved Â¦ aâ¢Â¦ satisfactory
Colonel Forwood, chief surgeon of the
department, visited Lieutenant Colonel
Field at Livermore Monday. He says
Colonel Field is physically In fair health,
but his mind is still diseased and he could
not say when the sick man would be ready
for duty again, even if he recovered suf
ficiently to return to the service. He will
probably be retired within a short time.
The retiring board was in session on
Tuesday and passed upon the cases of
Colonel Field and Captain George E. Sage
of the Sixth Artillery, who has been mili
tary Instructor at the Mount Tamalpala
Academy for some time, but Is now on
sick leave.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Howard "W.
Beal has been assigned to temporary duty

Â¦ Another prisoner escaped from the
guard at the Presidio Wednesday, and up
to last night he had not been caught. His
name is Doherty. and he was one of the
general prisoners brought over from Al
catraz every day to work at the Presidio.
The prisoners were all in the convalescent
hospital, where they were being given
their dinners, when Doherty seized an op
portunity when the guards were not look
ing and made his escape. He managed to
find some soldier's unlronn and this hÂ«Â«
put on, leaving his prison clothes with the
telltale "P" upon them behind one of the
doors of the hospital. : . .
! The escape of Doherty has caused the
orders to prisoners' guards to be materi
ally altered. It-was the. custom for* the
guard from Alcatraz to bring Â¦ over the
prisoners in the morning and take them
uaw in the evening, receiving or giving a
receipt for the number at each transfer,.
The garrison of the post furnished the
guard for the prisoners while they were at
work, but they had no means of Identify
ing them, nor did they know their names.
The only mark to Indicate who the pris
oners are is a "P" upon their clothes.
Now, however, the prisoners will be divid
ed into squads of ten or less, each squad
under a non-commissioned officer. He will
receive the names of the men in his squad
from the island guard and will be.respon
sible for his prisoners all the day. They
will not be allowed to mingle with the
*Â»ther prisoners," nor will they be permit
ted to eat with them, as was the case
when Doherty escaped. In this way no
"guard for prisoners will have more than
ten men to look after at any time. When
Doherty escaped the forty-five prisoners
brought over that day were all eating to
gether and his escape was not discovered
until the prisoners were checked up after
their dinner.
: Post orders have been changed so that
hereafter guard mount at the 'Presidio
will be held every evening at twenty min
utes to 6 Instead of at 10 In the morning,
as heretofore. . .. .'

Mr. Whittaker argued that as this was
the only source of outlet for European
and American capital, that was accumu
lating a* such an enormous rate, the shut

WEATHER PROPHET McADIH
has a long story to tell about
the Â¦windstorm that played up
and down the streets of this city
yesterday afternoon, toying with dust and
small rocks, hats and whiskers. The pub
lic may feel that something is being
passed to it when it drinks in the wise
explanations of the prophet with unques
tioning belief. That is the wrong spirit.
McAdie is paid to tell the truth, and he
does it scientifically.
The storm was born In Arizona, but
early in its history left the native heath
and strayed through the Colorado Valley.
Dissatisfied with this browsSig ground It
sported over the Sierras, shooting north
west into Idaho, where it is nowplaying
before crowded houses.
The high winds in this city came out of
the northwest on the trail of the genuine
blasts from Arizona. "It Is nothing more
nor less than a dry summer storm, with
no particular significance. In the city

Twelve representative citizens named;
above, by virtue of their authority aa
jurors in an action at law, have, Indelibly
placed" the .stamp of disapproval on tho
outlaw methods of Corrigan and his asso
ciates at Tanforan racetrack. Late yes
terday, afternoon these citizens came into
court and. entered judgment In favor of
Hyman Greenberg and against the West
ern Turf Association for $3000 damages,
incurred. by the defendant through its un
lawful, exclusion and ejection of plaintiff'
from. the corporation's fleecing ground. It
took'the jury but a few -minutes to agree
upon. the verdict. Only three ballots were
cast, and the . reason that ' an agreement
was not reached on the first ballot was
that four of the jurors were of the opinion
that' Greenberg should be given $5000 for
the wrongs he. had suffered. at the hands
of the Tanforan managers, and two of the
jurors Â¦ voted to award the plaintiff $4000.
On the third ballot, however, the jury
found a unanimous .verdict in favor OMII3
plaintiff ; for the sum named. - .
i Â¦ When the Case was called yesterday Sec
retary Green was again placed on the
stand and an effort to wrest additional
information from him - regarding his
knowledge of the alleged crookedness of
the men to whom he granted the privilege
of printing and circulating a form card
was made. Mr. Green was a hostile wit
ness, and objections to many of the ques
tions were sustained, with the result that
Green did not tell all he knew." Witnesses
then testified as to the good character of
the plaintiff and the case was submitted
for argument.
Attorney Harrison on : behalf of tho
plaintiff made a brief opening argument,
in which he fully covered trie law and
facts of the case. He was followed by
Attorney Alexander on behalf of the de
fendant. . Mr. Alexander made an effort to
convince the Jury that the rights of the
defendants within the confines of their un
holy racetrack were as sacred as thos-3 of
the citizen at his fireside. He said that
Greenberg had no more right to enter tho
track and carry away information to pub
lish for his own benefit than had the
newspaper reporter to force his way into
a private reception, and against the wish
of the host and hostess carry away the
names of the guests and other matters for
publication. He also said that in tho eye
of the law Greenberg's, action in continu
ing to visit the track when his presence
was not desired was boisterous conduct
and should preclude him from recovering
judgment. â¢'-. â¢ . " , '
Attorney Matt Sullivan made the closing
argument on behalf of the plaintiff. After
covering the facts of the case at bar he
pointed to the wealth of the corporation,
gained, he said, through the vices of the
peopleâ vices that did not exist until de
veloped by the unlawful methods and
questionable actions and schemes of the
managers of the defendant corporation.
He was unable to find where right existed
on the side of the defendant and he was
unable to see the logic of the comparison
of opposing counsel between the sanctity
of the home and the notoriety of the race
trsclc
When Mr. Sullivan had concluded his
argument Judge Dalngerfield charged the
Jury The court quoted the law which
prohibits the exclusion of any. person from
any public place of amusement unless the
person is under the Influence of liquor,
boisterous or of known bad character.
The law in the case left no loophole of
escape for the defendant corporation, but
still the management was strangely
shocked when the verdict was announced.
Jurors L. Bernstein and .H. S. Field,
both well-known business men, expressed
themselves freely about the case after
leaving the courtroom. Both said, they
believed the verdict to be .the only one
th>rt could have been found consistent
with the law and common reason. ' The
defendant corporation, they said, had sus
tained a Just and they hoped a lasting
rebuke for its unlawful methods and es
pecially for the attempt made by its man
agers to override the constitution provid
ing for the liberty of the press by closing
the track gates on a man because he
chose to. use. the information obtained
there for his private uses and gain.
