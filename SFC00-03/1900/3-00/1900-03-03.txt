water company's reservoir. A. rlcketty old
building, a veritable hovel and filthy air.
most beyond â¢ description, ' serves as "a
dwelling.- The ranch,: which lies far back
and is -only reached by a winding rocky
trail, is supposed: to be devoted to the
raising of grapes. â¢. A few straggling vines
clustered around two or. three tumble
down buildings, a tired looking horse blind

his story. : It. was practically as-follows:.

The entire- affair : has- caused- - a great

was almost 'blind, And ;the fact .has -been

fnio the" well accidentally, there are many
circumstances which discredit the.thebry.-
She was perfectly familiar with the place,
haying lived there many,. many :years;and
was'in .the :habit? of working"' her = ,way

capable of sustaining any, weight such as.
must have : been placed -upon : them had
she wandered onto the platform unawares
and they are still uninjured. .:'
â¢ The fact that-, the body floated on the
water is : regarded -as : a very suspicious
circumstance, In Â¦ view: of; McNamara's
statement that his Â¦ wife .was -alive last:
night. The well is thirty-seven feet deep
and Was full to within about ten. feet. of
ths 'surface; so It had. plenty of oppor

not have th*> poirfr to remit or modify duties

The Republican leaders, however; had a
bill ready to carry the President's recom

mediate consideration for it. and this was
given. . .It- was only ' when- , the -debate
Opened, it having been agreed that tweni.v
minutes should be allowed on a side that
under the. lead of Bailey. .of Texas the
Democrats began lining up against the bill
because It placed no limitation upon the
President's discretion In the use of the
money. The bill was passed by a vote of
162 to 107. thirteen Democrats (including
De Vriee of California); two Populists &nd
two Silver Republicans voting with the
Republicans in the affirmative. :_'. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.

Resuming the examination of Gage,- Mr.

was no resemblance between, the Lowen
trout house and the one on section 30, and
that ' one could not be mistaken ; for the
other. Houghton then took Gage in cross
examination.-: Hough.ton: brought out: the
fact that all the first hearings and decis
ions- went against Mr: 1 Gage, and these de
cisions -Houghton offered- in ;â¢ evidence.
Houghton ; then 3 took Â¦' up a Â¦-- line . of ques

statement , that *he Â¦ had used > Influence *to
Induce " Atwater to deed to - Gage his : In
terest in section 30, and to begin the pro

University of California Ath
letes. Are Training, for a
* Notable Engagement.
BERKELEY,. . March. . -âWith the Im
petus . given Â¦ the ,work of the . track men
by the prospects" of an Eastern trip new
life has developed in : that branch "of ath^
letics. All week every man who "signed
the first roll has been' out for practice. A
number of new men Lave also put ln a
few 1 hotirÂ» In the hope, that some shcrw
migbt be given' them " among the . chosen
few. .' .Â¦Â¦â¢â¢;Â¦ - ' â¢.- â¢ : :
Although- seven men whose records glvo
them first . call have, practically -been,
chosen- there are still three or four pl<ic-es
vacant and also al chance- -to- supersede
some other man.- There aro' at least : eight
good men wttb could make a point or two
If there was sufficient money to send them
all East. -As it is all-round men-^thosa
who can , compete ; ln several : eventsâ will
be chosen. The seven fortunate, one* are
Drum, Hoffman, Cadogan,. Broughtonr,
Plaw, -Woolsey and Bakewell. Those who
have the best chanco to make the vacan
cies are -Squires. Walsh and Scott In the
distance runs; Hamlin and Powell for the
hurdles.- and 'Symmonds- for the dashes.
This - week 1 has been set. aside particu
larly for post starting. It. ls. Drum's pol
icy rather to get the men accustomed to a
starter and to develop their; wind. The
segregation of possible candidates for' the
Eastern trip or the Stanford-California
field day will be attempted before the
sophomore-freshman field day,- March It).
The 'best men will be given a chance for
the Intercollegiate meet -and the best men
of that day ln turn will compose the crack
Eastern team.
â¢It wu brought out at the athletic com
mittee meeting last Tuesday evening that
the record of the men who will compose
the Eastern team (his year is better .than
the record'of the men of the '95 team.'be
fore they- met the Eastern athletes. In
the limited field which the Pacific Coast
affords the real ability of a man cannot
be brought out. He must meet a man hi s
equal or superior before a line- on his
work can correctly- be bad. All the '93
men did much, better work' ln the East
than they did here. Then, again. In the
East there will be warmer, weather, which
is always conducive to better .records.
The baseball men are encouraged by the
splendid showing they made against San
ta Clara last Saturday. The game
Wednesday with the Dental- College team
did little or no good by way. of practice.
The dentals were easily defeated by 19 to
4. -The moet noticeable Improvement ln
the team as a whole is ln batting. The
Infield Is also- steadily Improving. The out
field Is the hardest place, to fill and la at
present the weakest place. . - 'â¢ â¢ â¢
Kaarsbun? and Smith, the regular bat
tery, is Improving' day by day and will
undoubtedly- hold its own with Stanford's
crack ' battery, ' Strohn ' and Lanagan.
Kaarsburg is pitching steady ' ball, as
usual, and never goes', to "pieces. -.- Hl3
curves and; speed- are better .than . eve?
before. . Smith has corrected h's one week
point of throwinghiffh to DPjses and covers
the field ln clever style. . '..;â¢â¢
The. game. between Use. Fireman's Fund

to be interesting. It should afford a com

Tally-Ho Coach May Run From

The San Mateo County Hun^ had so
desperate a run on Washington's birth
day that a smaller number of members
than usual followed the hounds last Sat
urday. The meet was at. the Hbbart
farm, San -Mateo, and the run finished at
the Burlingame Country Club's 'home.
Frank J. Carolan was out and was ac
companied by E. -D. Beylard, J. Downey
Harvey, J. . J.s Moore, Peter Martin. C.
Dunphy and the Misses Brlttan. It has
been suggested that a coach should run
from San- Bruno to the points where the
meets take place, and If the plan is
adopted the coach will, probably be Â¦driven
by E. iD. Beylard. who is a ..fine whip."
until further notice the hounds will meet
every Monday at 8 a. m at UxÂ» polo field,-
Burllngnme. 'â¢ â¢ â¢
The card containing the fixtures for
March has been issued and Indicates that
on several Saturdays during the month
the members will be entertained at lunch
eon. The meet this afternoon will take
place at 3 o'clock at Reid's school, Bel-c
mont. being preceded at 1 o'clock by a
luncheon given by E. Duplissis Beylard.
On Wednesday the hounds will be laid on
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at the Six
teen Mile House on the San Bruno road.
Next Saturday the residents of this city
will be afforded an excellent opportunity
of witnessing a meet of the club, as the
rendezvous is at Ingleside racetrack at
2:30 p. m. The members will be enter
tained at luncheon by the master of the
hunt at 12:30 p. m. Theflnlsh will be at

ON the eve of the fifth renewal" of

track .this afternoon, the talent are all
at seaas to the ultimate result At the
present time of writing twenty horses
are eligible to face the barrier for the
$10,000 prize, and everything depend* on
â¢ the condition of the weather to-day as
to how many of them. will respond 1 to
post call. While half a 'dozen owners
are hoping for rain, they are in the
minority, for .'the others are burning
Chinese punks and doing all sorts of
things to allay the frowning wrath of
the weather god. -Then, too, the Jock
eys occupy the position- of a prince of
the royal blood, being in greater dc
: mand than a boss politician at election
â¢time. Fabulous sum's have been offered
to secure the services of two- or three
of the cracks.- For gameness in: this
respect W. J. Spiers, owner of Acrobat,
Js probably entitled to the plum.- Mr.
, Spiers once lost, the" greats Suburban
â¢handicap with Major Domo, and is well
aware of " the- fact that : a competent
'Jockey is a.' necessary commodity. ; If
rain should fall in sufficient- quantity
to makij . the course muddy ; Bai ney
Schrelber will not start Forte,- and the
bookmaker, accepted ' an . offer of $2000
.(from Owner Spiers for second call on
Bullman'.. Several other bids were In
! for the lad's services if Forte was' a"
non-starter, but this bold one far ex
ceeded them all. -

become unruly F. W. Brode, Advance â¢

As the time for the. race approaches
-a. review r.of 'the weights assigned by
Handicapper Brooks will show that- he
was not so severe with that one or so
. lenient with, this one as a first glance
would Indicate.- Indeed, the thing now.
-wears a very hard look. Dr. Sheppard
apd Arbaces, two of the top weight's Â¦
supposed to> be anchored, have started
â¢ "since the publication of the allotments
and ; created '"a' favorable- impression.'

Park has arranged a special stake to be
run-on the 18th lnst., which is expected to
attract widespread attention among the
followers of the sport. The stake' is lim
ited to eight entries, selected as follows:

West, â¢ Golden â¢ Rule, Flora McDonald,
Hawker, Rocker and either Luxor; or
Beacon from the kennels of Curtis & Sons.
Luxor, the winner of the John Grace chal
lenge cup, is the one most desired,' but his
fall in the â¢ sensational final * course left
him stiff and sore and he may not be in
condition to defend bis great reputation.

management will . all be * run < during i the

at the Chutes, who was arrested Thurs
day night by Detective Tom Gibson and
Corporal Williams, was booked at the
City Prison yesterday on four charges of
felony embezzlement. He Is accused of
getting a gold watch and chain from each
of. the firms of Vandersllce & Co. and
Shreve & Co. and musical Instruments
from Wise & Co. and Mauvais & Co. on
the pretense of selling them to a friend.
He pawned the articles and spent the
money on liquor.
.When he was booked at the prison yes
terday.- afternoon Blanchard seemed
to : be .on ' the verge of delirium
tremens. After being about an hour
in his cell he staggered and fell.
inflicting an ugly wound in his scalp.
While being driven to the Receiving Hos
pital â¢ in the patrol* wagon he remarked 1
that he had 'taken his Vlast drink," and
that was construed into the fact that he
had swallowed poison. He declared vehe
mently that he had hot poisoned himself,
but Dr. Cherry would take no chances
and applied the stomach pump. His
wound was then stitched and dressed and
an officer detailed to watch him!

.The tdtal loans fqr " February were
$1,770,378 -and the releases 'were $2,305,051.
The unusual spectacle is presented by last
month's figures of the satisfactions ex
ceeding the loans, and thaf lÂ»y a consid
erable amount. Fora long time past the
mortgages had about offset the' releases,
but it. had. been hoped that the reduction
in the rate of interest would cause a
greater demand for money in real estate.
This has proved to be the case only in
the- Instance "of. a few savings banks.
Others have . positively reduced their
loans on realty, .while (during the last
month the ! mortgages Â¦ made by - private
capital and miscellaneous corporations
have actually diminished about the dif
ference'between, the two cqlumns of :fig
ures. In one notable {instance in Febru
ary- a^large loan was, Â¦ however, taken
from one of the savings banks and placed
with ah estate at the low rate of 5% per
cent. Â¦ Interest' and .other favorable con

Seventeen new building contracts were

March 1 and their, aggregate value was
$102,200. Among the more prominent of
these contracts were those of L*evi Sirauss
with Joshua Hendy Machine Wows, tor
iron and- steel material, to cost $11,450;
with Western Iron WorKs, for same mate
rial, to cost $2600, and with Chris.- Chis

connection with -the construction of a
four-story and basement brick and steel
building on the east line of Battery street,

â¢'The number of new building contracts
filed for the month of February, 1900, was
lifty-flve, of the aggregate value of $224,
267 against fifty-nine contracts, valued
at $208,267, for February. 1899. The con
tracts-filed during the first two months
this year was 129, valued at $5.93,645.
against eighty-three, valued at $428,015, for
the first two months last year. The
Building News and Review , says: "No
fault can be Â¦ found Â¦ with the : increase of
building activities. In round numbers, the
totals show that the amount of work for
the first two months of the present year
exceeds the totals for same period In ISSW
by $165,633. Number of liens filed during
the month Is very small as compared with
many other monthÃ. .We note a'tendency
to shade; prices for several > articles used
in building construction. It would take
but a slight decline in prices to start own
ers on a progressive movement. Labor
promises to be well rewarded during the
year to come. In fine, prospects of al!
kinds are exceedingly brlitht. From near
ly every - county In the State ' assurances
have been . received that a goodly
quantity of. mechanical work will be start

The Park Commissioners are considering
the, remodeling and improving of Uiiion
Square, bounded by Powell, Stockton.,
Post and Geary streets. It Is proposed to
have a large oval-shaped lawn In the ccn
.ter, with walks leading from each of tho
four corners toward the center. One-half
of the distance between the corner and the
center of the square Is to be planted an
ovat-Bhaped group of shrubs, which is to
be carpeted with flowers. Around each of
these four groups the Walks will branch,
meeting again in the center. Alonsj thi>
line of Post street will be planted a row
of handsome palms. Phoenix; and alter
nating with idracaenas along the entire
front. Where the walks curve groups of
shrubbery will be placed, find also carpet
ed with flowers. I There will be in all thirty
groups of shrubbery. Along the Powell'
street side a heavy belt of trees win l.c
planted as a wind-break for the protection
of the square. The principal feature of
another. plan is fpr a great open lawn In
the center, flanked with groups of shrubs.

The Calaveras trees have been one of the principal factors by which the State
has been' made known throughout the world, and the advertising alone that we
have received from them is worth ten times the $100,000. for -which they have now
been sold.' Then there are the historical and botanical features to be considered
âthe fact that the trees belong- to a genus found nowhere on earth but in Cali
fornia, and if we permit them to be destroyed the sequoia will .pass from the
face. of creation forever. With these varied considerations â all valuable to "the
State's welfareâ at stake it does not seem possible .that there wHl.be aught "but

The people of the entire West should urge, and in terms Congress cannot fall

as a national reservation that its treasures may be ' preserved for all time." If
this plan falls, the property, should be purchased, by popular subscription, and" we

THE JOKER IN THE GAME.
LyXDEB trie" pretense of limiting racetrack gani
| bling .at Ingleside t.o a season of forty days in
. ; the year the resolutions which the Police Com
mittee, of which : -Supervisor Tobin is chair
roan, has provided for submission to the Super
\:~firs on Monday open avvay for racing every day
in the year and unlimited gambling at. the track upon
the so-called races to be".- .held there! iThe opening
fcr the gamblers is so plain it cannot' be mistaken,
n..ir can it be explained away by; any astuteness on the
jr rt of the special pleaders for ihe Eastern sports.
â¢ The resolutions, after setting forth the terms upon
which authority for racing and gambling may be per
n.iu'ed. say: "Xo such authority shall be granted to
at;V one ;pcrson,' copartnership, association or cor
poration for a period exceeding forty days in any one
year." That is the whole extent of the limitation put
upon the continuance of the racing. No one person.
of .-firm,, or corporation, can have the privilege for
more than forty days; .but there is nothing in the
resolutions to prevent the.- Eastern gamblers from
passing the. lease of the track from one to another,
?nd thus obtaining a new privilege every forty days
SO lone as the year laVt*' â¢ â¢ 'Â¦ 'â¢
â¢ In the?e days the formation of corporations has
been made so easy it would not be difficult for the
unscrupulous sharpers from the. East to form them
selves into a dozen corporations for racing purposes
were there any need of it. The resolutions, however,
save them even that .slight trouble. They can take
up the lease one. after another as individuals," or : as
partner's, or as associations, and work the game in
definitely: â¢ : : V" . ' Â¦ "- - ' ".
It is. to- be. borne in mind the gamblers will have
.strong inducements to tr.ke every possible advantage
.of the way that, has been provided for continuing
their games.-; The profits to the managers of track
gambling ar .c large under any conditions, and will be
a veritable bonanza under the terms of these resolu
tions'; which close all the! downtown poolrooms and
give a irhanopory. to the Eastern gang .that controls
.Ingleside track. The. city and county of San Fran
cisco, lost the gamblers through Widber's defalca
tion alone;sit6.ooo T and there is no telling how much
more was lost by banks' and businessmen through the
embezzlements or petty, thefts of their employes,
tempted- to dishonesty by the track gamble*;.
ConsWefed iri any light,, the. proposed resolutions
come close to being ah^.actual infamy. The specious
show of vjrtue in the pretended restriction of garhr
blipfef to a' season of forty days adds to; the vile de

THE REV. J. S. THOMAS.
Â¦jp=SNEV. J, S. THOMAS, pastor of the
L^/ Howard :Presbyterian Church, and
|p^_ the Cymrodorion Society of Call-
fornia have' had a falling out.
It Is . all over dancing. .The : Cym
rodorions are the Welsh society. Last
Thursday evening they, celebrated St. Da
vid's day, the exercises taking place in'
Pioneer Hall. One of the addresses on the
programme was . to ' have been made by
Rev. Mr. Thomas and : he was duly an
nounced to speak. While the proceedings
were in progress Â» the ; chairman of the
Cymrodorions, Taliesin Kvans.-rose. and
said that the second address of ; the . even-
Ing would not'be delivered, as Rev. ' Mr.
Thomas at the eleventh hour had decided
that he would not take part because there
was something on the. programme that
he did. not like. - .^' . â¢ â¢
The members ! of the .society looked up
surprised when this announcement was
made, as the â¢programme > consisted of
only addresses and -songs of the most .ex
emplary sort and was .'to wind up 'with
a dance, for which an orchestra had beep
engaged.' The people talked- the -matter
over a little, but soon were merrily danc
ing and seemingly had forgotten the epi
sode. Â¦ ... â¢- â¢ .
Rev. Mr". Thomas heard what had .been
said by the chairman publicly and yester
day told a reporter for The Call why it
was that he did not appear to make- the
expected â¢ address. "For ten years," said
Mr. Thomas, "I have been preaching
against dancing. When the Cymrodorion
Society inyited me to address them . l con
sented. Â¦Â¦Something was said that there
might be dancing after the exercise,- "I
was surprised .when I saw the ; printed
programme which announced , a concert
and dance on St. David's day, the dance
being as much a part of the- programme
as the literary- exercises and .concert. I
could not consistently' address the society
under the circumstances: That is all there
is to the matter." " â¢-. '
The presidential campaign.
SINCE the accession of President McKinley ;o
oiiice, the enactment of a protective tariff and
the nrm maintenance of the gold standard have
been followed by an era of unexampled prosperity in
all parts 'of the Union, an impression has prevailed
among Republicans and business men generally that
the Presidential campaign this year is virtually a
'walkover for the Republican candidate, and that the
crushing defeat of Bryanism is a foregone conclusion.
.Others have argued that since the Senate is
strongly Republican there will be no danger of a sil
ver bill even should Bryan be elected. From that
they have proceeded to draw the conclusion that th?
Bryanites will be not only indifferent to a calamity
agitation in a year of prosperity, but, perceiving the
hoplessness of the silver movement, will be despond
ent and inactive in the contest. , To these sanguine
citizens the re-election of McKinley seems, therefore,
to be doubly sureâ first, by reason of his own
strength, and, second, by reason of. the weakness of
his opponent. ? ;Â¦Â¦-.â¢ . v y
Such views are in the main correct enough, but
now as the campaign is approaching it .will be well
for Republicans to take note of the strength- as well
as .of the weakness of the adversary. We had an era
of prosperity during the operation of the McKinley
taritT under the Presidency of Harrison, but none the
less the Democrats elected their candidate at the next
election. The warning of that year should not be for
gotten. If the Republican leaders be not wise and
the rank and file animated by a resolve to work. to
win, the campaign will not.be so easy a walkover as
is now believed!
In the. first place it is to be remembered that in
1896 Bryan received over 6,500,000 votes, being about
a million more- than were cast for Cleveland at the
previous election. That immense vote was given to
him despite the fact that a large number of conserva
tive Democrats forsook the party after -his nomina
tion, and that he had to make the contest without the
aid of many of- the most eminent Democratic leaders
arid without the help of its best organizers. â¢
.There is a .spirit of radicalism behind the Bryan
movement that gave it strength to capture the Demo
cratic party, merge it with Populism, and poll a. vote
that will be forever memorable in the history of our
politics. That radicalism will not. have in this peripd
of prosperity the same power over the masses it had
in the hard times, of 1896, but it will still be too pow
erful for any patriot to despise. The fact that in spite
of the efforts of so many Democratic leaders to de
pose him, Bryan holds unshaken his control of the
party, is a proof that he has on his side a host that
will' make a vigorous fight for him and his platform
from the time the campaign opens until it closes.
Moreover, it^is unsafe for Republicans to rely too
much upon the Senate. The Republican majority in
that branch of Congress is lgrge," it is true, but there
is danger that the seats now held by Wolcott of Colo
rado, Carter of Montana, Shoup of Idaho; Baker of
Kansas and Thurston of Nebraska may be lost to the
Republicans when, the next Congress meets. The
margin of security is therefore narrow, and it is evi
dent the Republicans and sound money men generally
can afford to take ro chances. It must' be a campaign
of work from start to finish. ''Â¦/'Â¦

the constituents of Mr. de. Vries want to know how
he voted and his reasons for it, and as a public man
he is entitled' to publicity of both his vote and his
reasons. Does the Examinemhink it can do a very
large business in politics by attacking the President
for lack*of consistency, or for, his policy in govern
ing external, possessions, while it is" afraid to let its
readers know how .the only Democratic Representa
tive from the Pacific Coast voted on the first roll
call in the House which involved that policy? Hay
ing nailed the flag to Porto Rico and the Philippines,
what will the .Examiner have? Does.it want our
gates opened to an invasion of ten millions of Asiatic
coolies to overwhelm American white labor? -DoÂ«s
it want these tropical people endowed with the .Ter
ritorial status, with the prospect of speedy' statehood?
We say frankly that rather than either 'we would
draw out the nails and bring the flag home, where it
belongs, under the shelter of the constitution. '
.While Colonel Bryan might be dreaming: about
President McKinley. perhaps he will say, or, the Ex
aminer will say' fcr him, just what policy he proposes
for these external possessions? He is responsible
for their presence in our problems. Senator Hoar
had the Paris treaty beaten, and would have forced
its amendment in the- matter of~ the Philippine pur
chase, but Colonel Bryan. persuaded' enough Demo
cratic Senators to. vote' for it to ratify it, and, ac
cording to the constitution, make it the supreme law
of the. land. What will Mr. Bryan do in his cam-,
paign? Will he favor statehood for the islands he in
sisted upon taking? Will the Examiner use its
"longest leased wire in the world" to get a state
ment of his policy? As things stand now the only
Democratic Congressman from this coast agrees with
The Call, and the Examiner is afraid to publish his
vote, and mutilates its own news dispatches to
avoid it. ' Â¦

ABOUT DREAMS.
THE Examiner, suggests the great luck that is
just now coming to Colonel Bryan. It says
that if he had dreamed of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty four months ago and of the Porto Rican tariff
bill he would have been put under treatment for de
lirium. ,
No one will dispute that Colonel Bryan is a
dreamer. His campaign in 1896 was composed of
reveries, involving prophecy that never came true,
and perhaps the only reason why he did not dream
about the treaty and the tariff is that they are facts,
and his dreams run to pure fiction and fancy.
But some one had a chance to dream about the
Examiner longer ago than four months. It was early in
the field with the proposition to take Porto Rico and
nail the flag to* the Philippines, and to govern them
and all external possessions non-constitutionally. It
attacked Mr. Cleveland for saying that the whole con
stitution must go. wherever the flag was "nailed,"
and declared that everybody knew that.the constitu
tion need not be applied to external regions that fell
into 'our hands. This it affirmed to.be a matter of
common knowledge, known to everybody but the
ex-President, over whom. it poured, a bucket of bil
lingsgate! Who would have dreamed that now .it
would be hugging the constitution and insisting that
it must be nailed up with the flag?
So acute is its change that it suppresses news in. or
der to conceal its inconsistency.. The Examiner's
party has one member. of Congress- from this State.
Mr. de Vrics, and he voted for the Porto Rican. tariff,
land therefore for the non-constitutional government
of external possessions.- He gave his; reasons .for this
vote, and it .sufficed as the reason for .the votes of the
three Democrats who agreed with him. In its report
of the vote.' "over the longest leased line in .the
world." the. Examiner excludes Mr. -de Vries' : .nan:e
entirely,, and refers to: the Democratic defection in
this paragraph:." "As for. the four Democrats* .who
voted for the bill, it is obvious that Messrs^ Davey
and 1 Meyer of Louisiana did so because of 'the .sugar
interests' of their -State. ;Mr, Sibley'is to all intents,
and purposes a Republican in. everything except the
Congressional Directory." But What influenced the 1
fourth bolter? Who is he? . Where is -Mr! -di Vries?"
Is he also a: Republican, or was he influenced by the
sugar interests r of California? The ..Call and the
Chronicle gave him the henefit of his statement of his
reasons. ,buf he is as completely lost in the Exam r
inefV news pis Colonel . Bryan will be in -the returns'
next -November. .. ; â¢", ' â¢; . '
Now what is the use -of having "the longest leased
wire in the world!' il^the news is either manufactured
or suppressed at the Examiner end of it? Perhaps

"Public gambling is a great evil, leading to

message to the present Board of Supervisors.
COMPLIMENT TO CRONJE.
ITcomes as news from English sources that Cronje
is to be exiled. Great Britain is an artist in
. exiling." Bonaparte, the King of Delhi, successor
to the Moguls/, Arabi Pasha and the King of Bur
niah have been successively the victims of her policy
of punishment by a living death. We have been -her
partner in one small job of that kind in the banish
ment'of. a Samoan chief for the crime of being pre
ferred by his countrymen for their ruler.
While the banishment of Cronje may â¢ never be
effected, that it springs up first of all propositions in
the" English mind, as a proper disposition to make of
a brave foeman, is a revelation of the mean spirit of
.revenge .that goes along with the larcenous politics
â¢of Chamberlain and Rhodes.' Cronje's crime, to be
punished -by exile,- consists in manfully defending his
country.' Beset by a British force that outnumbered
.his, in men and gun's* more than ten to one, he held
the empire in action, ten days, fighting until powder,
food and water were gone before he surrendered, not
to Lord Roberts, but to the necessities of nature and
the demand of- famine. Instead of appreciating the
manhood, of such a foe, Lord Roberts subjected him
to humiliation .by compelling him to wait at the flap
of his" tent until that representative of British gal
lantry chose to receive him and grant terms of sur
render. Washington did not treat Cornwallis that
way at Yorktown, nor did Jackson insult the .suc
cessor of Pakenham at New Orleans.
The conduct of Roberts toward his brave prisoner
has touched- the quick of soldierly honor throughout
the world. It was the insolent forerunner of the
proposition to send its victim into exile, to fade un
der a strange sun and die broken in spirit and in
heart.
: The gentle, the Christian spirit of Great. Britain is
further shown in selection of the spot to which
this manly soldier is to be sent to punish him for with
standing her legions ten hard days and nights, though
they outnumbered him ten to one. The place selected
is Mauritius, formerly known as the Isle of France,
and wrested from France with other small plunder
during the Napoleonic wars. It is located in the
middle of the hot hell of the- Indian Ocean, and is
only about 470,000 acres in extent. It is a tangle of.
poisonous tropical verdure, and is crowded by a
coolie population, which steams and stews in the sun
and evaporates quickly. It is the Devils Island of
the British empire, the black, hole of that widespread
greed which is called imperial power. Its population
is periodically swept away by pestilence. In 1854
17,000 died of cholera. In 1567 malarial fever carried
off 30,000. Before the first and between the two
epidemics and since the last pestilence worked in that
choice, steaming, tropical culture bed of plague and
death. The number of victims is - never reported ex
cept when depopulation cuts off the revenue of the
British exploiters, who wring pounds, shillings and
pence out of the brawn and blood of the coolies by a
"benevolent despotism," compared to which chattel
slavery in the United States was an eleemosynary in
stitution. To this scat of plague and pestilence, this
hole of horror, where a vertical sun sweats poison out
of tropical growth that rots and grows and grows and
rots without ceasing, making air and water toxic
agents of death, it is proposed to send brave oid
Cronje. because he defended himself and the liberties
of his country as long, as food, water and cartridges
held out.
We do not .flatter ourselves that there is enough
sense of justice in the world to rise and shame Eng
land out of this purpose; if that Government enter
tain it. for the world's public' opinion is not enough
to have made the proponent of the scheme ashamed
to propose it. '
It is a compliment to Cronjc. It is confessing that
Roberts and Kitchener will; feel safer in completing
the assassination of the republics if they know that
Cronje is a safe -prisoner in the midst of the Indian
Ocean.

the' accusations- of neighbprs^and friends
'.that' the Kauff manns pushed their. idolized
only'.chlld ' with Undue": severity, -.in/ theiP;
efforts -.tty njake her. an infant; prodigy.
Although. "Angelica's: unusually sweet-'dis
posltlpn enabled her to Rly her brush With
irifinlie content, her Â¦ powers must :have
been "taxed- to. the . utmost, to have led
her- to- take up portrait painting at the
age. of 101 â¢ It Is a well authenticated fact
that at that age she -executed a portrait
of the Bishop., of Como, not at all af
frighted at the magnitude of such an un
dertaking/ and achieving a most pleasant
pastel of .her venerable friend which gave
satisfaction to- aIL Her two years' stay
at Como,. to .which she always, referred
as .the happiest period of her life, made
such a profound impression upon Angelica
that she was loth to 'exchange the ro
mantl-c lake for the benefits, of. an.un
known city. At this tender.age she had
already developed that power of pleasing
which amounted almost to genius. She
soon- found at Milan, however, a circle of
friends as devoted as hercoterle at Como.
Her parents took her to Milan In ord'^r
that she might study directly from the -jld
masters. Leonardo da Vinci .especially
fired her girlish ambition, and she set her
self so dilfgently to copying his power and
delicacy that traces of this study arc dis
coverable In all her subsequent work. The
city life, the old cathedrals and the art at
mosphere of Milan made a profounJ yet
stimulating Impression upon -the Sensitive
childartlst and developed prematurely. lier
natural Â¦ aptitude, and., the popularity. ' : of
her work soon followed. This is not the
first instance of that - premature - success
which, eventually prevents. the full devel
opment oi a great power by curtailing th<*
helpful discipline of early and persistent
drudgery.: : - -. Â¦ . . ,â¢â¢ - : > '-Â¦ .â¢ Â¦'
. When it reached the ears of the Duke of
Modeha, Governor of -Milan, that alktle
girl was copying from dawn to dusk: the
masterpieces In his gallery he and his
wife sent .for- her, and so pleased; were
they with her winsome simplicity that the
Duchess ordered her portrait of thelltUe
14-year-old. -and an obsequious court pre
cipitately followed suit.'- Â¦ Angelica's per
sonality developed to great advantage In
the Milanese court. Tall, slender. Inter
esting: but not beautiful, she soon proved
that. she was. mistress of the of keep
ing friends as well as' of making them. Â¦-
â¢ Fortwo years: she busily, piled her Brush,
having "more orders than she "could" fill..
Then. In her sixteenth, year, she lost;her
mother. .*This first ; great : blcT? made" her
feel an-averslo.n.to Milan and ; all Its.; a*-:
s,ociatl6ns," so Angelica and her: father'dis
consolately turfled their" course Â¦ toward
Bregem; -Kauffmann's native home. Here,
she decorated the parish church with gi
gantic pictures of the apostles," taken- from'
oldi engravings.:: Soon she was appointed
to paint â¢ the portrait of Cardlnal.'Rnth, :
Bishop of' Constance, arid from his castle
at Mprsburg she- wandered, with her father
back-to Northern Italy. ..-. . ;' â¢
-At the age of' 2o came the great crsls of
Angelica Kaufrmanri's life. .Her piayiuc

vlted her to assist in the decoration of

purpose were assigned her. but the Bishop
of London.. In face of the hearty approval '
of: the. King and the Archbishop of Can

Â¦ Some critics have attributed to vanity
Angelica's numberless portraits of herself,
but If- so. then Mme. Le Brun. Rubena,
Rembrandt and many of the old masters
must come under the same. ban. She
probably resorted to this expedient, as did â¢
they, in order to practice upon an ever
present model. This was especially neces- ":
sary in the eighteenth century, when pro- '
fessional ; women models were unknown
and women artists were never admitted
to the life classes. .
. Such, exceptional honors as were show- .
ered upon Angelica Kauffmann necessar
llv aroused much Jealousy, and her un
fortunate marriage with the valet of
Count de Horn, who panned himself off as'
his master, is thought by: many to- have
been the result of a plot hatched by Jeal
ous artists, or discarded lovers. Lovers,
she always had. for she was: fond of at
tention: yet' she made two loveless mar
riages notwithstanding. Although Imme
diately separated from her adventurer
husband, she felt very keenly the blight
upon her life,, and would not consider any
more congenial marriage until his death,
ten', years later. . . . - . . " â¢ .
At that time her father, being !n fall-,
ing health, negotiated a marriage for her j â¢
with Antonio Zucchl. an elderly artist of
upright â¢ character. Her unsentimental â¢â¢
second husband looked upon the marriage
as a . successful commercial speculation,'
his special -.province being that of steward
to -the- breadwinner of the family.
With Zucchl she left London for Italy.
where she... passed- the remainder of.h er.
life, the Idol of literary, friends and royat- ,
patrons. 1 She received the- title of court
painter to! her Majesty of the two Sicilies/
and. refused offers of other', positions -. at '.Â¦"
court. At- the time- of the : - French oos-'
session- of Rome (1793-99) /General Kspl- -.

Indications are that "the "higrhbinder ttar
in Chinatown will be fought to.' a bitter
end. The ultimate object of the struggle
will, be: to crush the Suey; Sing -Tong. out
of â¢ existence. :In this : acilon - the" Suey
Sings" foes are said tQ have the support
of nearly every tong and element in tne
Chinese, quarter, â¢ extending even to- the
commercial . bodies ; themselves. For a
number of years this tong has been troub
lesome, always' involved in some difficulty
and bringing distress to the better ele
ment of Chinese- while its struggles con
tinue. Its members ace principally Hsher
meh who seek the northern climes when
the canneries are running, and who return
to this city in the winter, throwing the
burden" of their keep on their. white, em
ployers and spending little- money. . Â¦
Odds are. greatly against the Suey
Sings ' Three tongs, are banded against
them, and the bulk of their members will
shortly, leave fpr the summer fishing .sea
son In Alaska,- leaving but few here to
bear the- battle's brunt. The members of
the Wai ling Tong. the Sin Sue Ying and
the Hop Sing Tong are principally serv
ants and cooks about town, and the Suej
Sings' opponents will retain their numeri
cal strength. Under these conditions the
latter tong Is likely to meet its AY aterloo
and be-stamped out of existence for some
time in San Francisco.'â; â¢ . Â¦Â¦:
The" Hop Sings were, obliged yesterday
to pay to the Ping Kong Tong about $200
for a man they shot by mistake during
the last trouble; on. Stone street. If this
action had not- been taken the Ping Kongs
had threatened to assist the Suey Sings
In the present trouble. Last night the Six
Chinese Companies offered- an additional
fcWO reward for the arrest and- conviction
of the murderers. This makes -a. total, re
ward of $600, Half of which will.be given to
the person/who- arrests the-, criminal, and 1
the other half to the person whose testl-.

Harrison's Circular says: - "During the week
there have been three arrivals of- Ccal from
British ' Columbia, with 10,507" tons; two from
Washington, 4940 .tons;' two from Oregon SSO
tons; total. 16,427. tons. This is considerably
less, than the actual quantity consumed here
this week, hence our position Is not improving
besides, the Alaska fleet has commenced to take
delivery of its fuel for the season at British
Coltimbla. thus necessitating some delay in get
ting what Coal is -demanded for our local uses.
Prices are unchanged, with no apparent desire
on the part of producers to advance same For
tunately for some of. our factories, crude oil
Is .being substituted temporarily, thus easing
the strain-that would otherwise exist for Coal
"Australian and English products are seldom
asked . for now by large consumer*, as their
prices, have become almost prohibitory, j Coal
quotations in the' colonies have riot been ad
vanced, but freights are high and carriers' are
not procurable, as Honolulu is a more 'profitable
port for vessels to seek.. Freights on Coal from
England are less than from Australia but Coal
values have 'been in some cases advanced over
ICO -per cent, which shuts those' ports out for
future fuel supplies. -Before . the end of this
month there will be some new steam collier*
drilled into the service; these combined with
a decreased consumption for Â¦ house purposes
will ease ud our present congestion"

Bradstreet 's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. March 2.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial â¢ Review to-morrow will : say: In spite of
the, continuance of favorable- factors bearing
upon the position of the stock markets here,
and abroad speculation continues to be limited
and: dragging. The public here does not re
spond to the remarkable Increase In earnings
by purchasing stocks at the present level iif
prices,, and In London, while the succession . of
Brlttsb victories In South ' Africa i has caused
an- Improvement In prices,. It has. failed to
stimulate any decided influence upon the course
-of values. It nan continued to be a profes
sional market and the activity by commission
bouses, - which shows the. extent to which, the
public Is Interested in current, speculation, has
been Intermittent and timid. .The most strik
ing. Incident of the week was the placing of
the .Third Avenue aurface road In the hands
of a recclvsr. This actlcn, however, appeared
to", relieve the anxiety otHttiOi street as to
whether .the troubles of that property might
not hflve far-rcaclilng effects In oertaln finan
cial quarters. . The fate of the road â¢ had - been
indeed hanging over the market for a fort
night or more and the announcement that ihe
courts had -at last, taken -It In charge resulted
In h. general rally, in prices Wednesday. Third
Avenue, after a recovery from !U depression
sold down again later < In the week â¢Â¦ to still
lower figures and all of the . local New York
stocks which possess f ranchliet taxable under
the new State law were -.lnfluenced more or
less unfavorably hy the fact 'that the assess
ment of these franchises Is now In progress
Th* industrial stocks were for the most part
heavy and Â«eemed to be affected by liquida
tion .of long' holdings. This wits In some quar
tern'attributed to the possibility, of anti-trust
legislation being considered In Congress. There
w ji s M.lr*Q 111 hÂ« iirHr* instinofi) > c v lilc nc** of nilâ
loading by pools In these stocks. Sugar was
a weak nml disturbing feature, : the price 'of
the Ktock dropping on the : unfavorable antici
pation* about the next dividend. There' 'was
no .luck of bearish- activity on the part of
the traders 'iii these and other Industrials and
special stocks. Selling pressure .of that de
scription also extended to -portions of the rail
road share list, -notably :. Baltimore, smd Ohio
At the same time railroad stocks, showed . a
considerable undertone of strength and In some
cases, notably the Atchlson. which has been
heavily bought for foreign account, a moder
ately bullish tendency was exhibited . -'

V'NEW TORK. I March 2.-R. 'Â¦ G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review. of Trade to-morrow will say:
Besides the BSI commercial failures for $9,931,
045,. which .'were reported to-day, there Vere
in February; six > banking failures for . *620,1-i.
and ' receivers- were appointed for "Â»Â« i l^ l *Â°
States Flour Millln? Company with $20,000,WW
of stock and ; $15,000,000 of bonds authorized at
Its organization last April and for the Third
Avenue Railroad Company a tier Hens for sev
erÂ»! millions had been placed upon the prop
erty.; Unless separated lrom such events com
mercial failures .could not be compared with
benefit. The manufacturing failures for $4^
257,638 were larger than in February of ISÂ»6
or .1895, but more than half the amount was
In .two: classes, one clothing and four large
lumber failure* i making 3Â« per cent of the
whole. The trading failures were larger than
in February of last year, only; but. 20 per cent
of; these defaults were made In nve failures.
In most branches r (he oomparlson wltn pre
vious,'years is â¢ encouraging . and an analysis
brings out in .strong light theremaritably low
average of liabilities in the' smaller : failures
which constitute the great majority, indicating
Â¦sound business Â¦ conditions and unusually sat
isfactory collections. The rise of cotton to
i 9Hc. .the highest, point since January, 18*3, has
done much to stimulate business, drawing from
Southern plantations and country towns more
than double the quantity marketed last year,,
distributing millions to producers, whose pur
chases of supplies are thus increased and
swelling beyond all â¢ expectation the purchases
for export. Heavy selling of cotton by people
who had none.- but felt certain that 8c would
mark the limit of the rise,- had placed them
quite at the mercy of holders.- But pie mar
kets both for goods and for cotton have been
affected all over the world- and. the country
will reap some benefit In a larger excess of
merchandise exports over Imports.' Â¦ â¢.-.'.
The market" for goods has been pushed to
sreater activity, though they have risen only
3, per cent Blnce the year" began.- while- the
material has risen over 25 per cent. : â¢
Â¦Except across, the ocean, -where events in.
South Africa caused nearly all business to
be forgotten, changes In the stock market rank
next In financial interest to the rise in cotton.
It wasr a reVelation of the appreciation la
which: American railway stocks are held to
see them strongly supported, with Third Ave
nue-falling to about 50 and Flour Milling dis
missed to the. hands of receivers. :
Â¦The small rise in wheat; though the price
is quite low, sufficed to- call from the farms
such receipts. 4,105.661 bushels, against 3,1j9.437
last year, as to Indicate that supplies are not
nearly exhausted.- Exports from Atlantic ports
continue small . for the week, flour included,
only 1,812,306 bushels, against- 4,069.984 last year,
and in four weeks from both coasts, exports
have been 11.639,260. against 14.823.373 bushels.
Though exports ran behind last year,, whiph
were -almost unequaled. they have already ex
ceeded In eight-months those of the full-years,
and the exports of corn, in four weeks, 12.724.
655 bushels, against 12.051,053 last year, explain
much' of -the .difficulty, corn rising three
quarters of a cent during the. week, while
wheat declined l^ic.
The "Iron and steel Industry continues the
greatest weekly . output ever known, even
while. ir.en speak of it as waiting for more
definite atsjrance about the future. Price
of pig yielded a little, some sales of.bessemer
having been trade at Plttsburg for $24 and
anthracite No. 1 Is quoted here at $23 50. Bil
lets have been sold at $33 at Pittsburg. For
most finished products prices are stronger than
a week ago, or as strong, bars and sheets
being strengthened by large business while
oniy plates appear weaker, $2 10 being quoted
for sizes not the widest. Coke Is scarce and
higher In spite of the largest output ever,
-known and the wages ! of â¢ hands have been
raised 12V4 per cent to the highest ever paid.
The decline in hides at- Chicago continues,
having been over 2 per cent the past week
and 9 per cent from the. highest point -in, De
cember. Leather -ha* declined only 3 per cent
from the -highest point. Boots and shoes have
yielded ' very little and ' many dealers ended
their Eastern trip without buying and Intend
to wait until April -as they did last 'year,
when they paid rather less than the price
asked in February. Yet . shipments on past
orders have been in February 380,214 cases,
about 50,000 more than . in IS9B or any other
year. .
Failures for the week have been 222 "In the
United States, against ISB last year, and 2S In

GOLFERS ARE HAPPY.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March 2.â The last
skunk has vanished from the San Rafael
Golf Club's links and left no trace behind
him, and while hoot mons and women
are rejoicing over the retreat of the mal
odorous enemy the caddies are planning
a banquet which will make any previous
festivities look like thirty cents.
For weeks skunks and coyotes have
avoided the swats of the pursuing brassies
wielded by the caddies, cheered on by the
hoot mons, and skunk hunts as an amuse
ment threatened to supersede golf. But
now all is changed. For two whole days
no skunk or coyote has shown himself,
and the links once more are beginning to
resound to the mashing sound of the
learner's Vbrassie" as it tears largechunks
out of the ground in a misdirected effort
to make a record drive.

DECLARE THEIR
FRIENDSHIP FOR
MAJOR ARTHUR
Statement Prom the Officers
of the Hospital Ship
Missouri.
The feeling among the: officers on the
hospital f?hip Missouri, despite statements
to the comrary. is devoid of bitterness or
malice. The friction between Major Ar
thur, the ffureeon In command, and Cap
tnin Dillon, the navigating captain, has
ttf-en exploited, but it has also been aa
te:ted that there was much 111 feeling
among the medlcaj officers and Junior offi
cers of the ships company. In answer to
tills the officers both of the ship tind the
medical department huve drawn up a
Fta'cuient which they intend to have pub
lished in the army journals. In this they
jedare there is no I}l feeling between
themselves and Major Arthur, and any
report to the contrary i* without foun
dation; that there has been perfect har
mony and ffood feeling : throughout the
trip from New York to Manila and then
to San Francisco, and that they regard
Major Arthur with Ihe : highest esteem
and the warmest friendship. This state
ment, has been Figned by: all the medical
oftiecrs and by ail the officers of the ship's
company. . .
The statements that the ship- is- unsea
:worthy are eaperly denied by the officers
or the ship. She Is said to have a repu

WHY THERE IS A BIG
TREASURY DEFICIT
Besult of the Merchants' Associa
tion's Investigation of the
City's Finances. .
At a recent meeting of the Merchants'
Association a committee was appointed to
look into the deficit in the funds of the
city. Yesterday at a special meeting the
committee presented a long report to the
effect that by the end of the fiscal year
the deficit will amount to $211,661 11. The
report says:
When the present officials of the city gov
ernment took office under the new charter on
January 8, 1900, they were confronted with a
deficiency of $139,281 11. This deficit was main
ly owlns to a deficiency of $18,039 37 for elec
tion purposes. The expenditures for the munic
ipal election on â¢ November 7, 1899, and the two
bond elections on December 27 and 29, 1899,
aggregated $124,533 37, while the appropriation
for elections during the fiscal year was only
$66,500. Furthermore, the appropriation for
the expenses of the Health Department
amounted to $46,960, while the last Board of
Health expended during the six months end
ing. December 31. 1599. $46,572 47. Moreover, the
appropriation for â¢ stenographers : In criminal
cares was $13,200, while the expenditures Â¦ for
this purpose during the first six months of. the
present fiscal year amounted to $23,424 95.
There was also appropriated $10,000 for I pur
chasing furniture and making repairs to pub
lic buildings, whereas there was spent for this
purpose during the first six months $11,557.
In the Judgment of the Finance Committee,
the only departments In which reductions
could be enforced were those not mentioned
in section 5. chapter 11. article 111, of the
charter. The^e departments are the Board of
Public Works, â¢ Board of Health ? and street

he married her she told him that her
first husband, William Beaver, had met
his death in a railroad accident. Believ

her, but has since learned, so he alleges,
that Beaver is still alive. Hence the suit

Mrs. Mary McCarthy At

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.1118 Broadway. March 2.
Smarting under the imagination that her
neighbors hated her and believing, that
they were conspiring to railroad her to
an insane asylum, Mrs. Mary McCarthy
came over from San Francisco this after
noon to end her misery on this side of the
bay.
After wandering about Emeryville sev
eral hours she walked over to the wharf
at the rear of the Parafflne Paint Works
and Jumped into the bay. Fortunately
several of the employes at the paint works
witnessed the woman's rash act and res
cued her in the nick of time. Â¦ "
She was turned over to Deputy Constable
Ed Kowland, who took her to the County
Jail, but the Jailer refused to receive her
as a prisoner and on his suggestion she
was taken to the insane ; department of
the Receiving Hospital. When , Warden
Page requested the officer to appear as
petitioner to have her . examined for in
sanity, however, Rowland declined and
escorted the woman to the address she
gave as her home. 522^ Grove street, San
Francisco. . . . . , Â¦ : . .
"My neighbors see everything I do,"
she explained to the officer, "and. they
hear and say lots of things. They would
like to have me in an asylum and so I
concluded to end my life.
Mrs. McCarthy is about 45 years' old.
She was well dressed and has a husband
and daughter.

Small Boys Are On Hand and Play Havoc With Animals Along the Line.
WITH Just enough red fire to please the small boy and
some real circus band music that pleased every
body Norris & Howe exhibited last night some dozen
or more gayly painted circus wagons drawn -by
ponies and packed with dogs. It was a circus pa
rade up and down Market street, and the usual crowd lined
the streets as It passed by.
Norris & Howe own a diminutive circus, and all their para
phernalia harmonize with the central idea of smallness. The
vehicles were of all description, from the miniature patrol
wagon toa fanciful fire engine worked by a quartet of dogs
that put the band out of noise business at the drop of the flag.
Every variety of the species canine was in. the procession. They~
divided honors with the ponies, whose breastplates bespeak
their foreign origin.
A zebra and an Infant elephant were the features of the anl
maldlsplay. The baby with the tusks was in sore straits, for
the small boy was on deck to make his tail ache. Crowding
around the thick-skinned but sensitive creature a mob of yo.uth
ful animal teasers played a star . engagement behind the ele
phant along the line. The elephant's name is Fargo, and. he
served notice after the procession last night that he would re
fuse to appear hereafter In shows of the like . kind. At the
Mechanics' Pavilion the drivers and the driven and the band
, went to roost.

There is comedy in every turn at the
Orpheum this week, even the acrobatic
features with which the programme be
gins and ends being of that character. The
Dancing Passparts are among the new
comers, and it is the comic element in
their act that saves it from being quite
ordinary. The female Passpart is agile
but graceless, and after her whirl at
legitimate dancing, in which she is a dead
failure, she takes to the grotesque with
huge success.
Trovollo is a super-average ventrilo
quist, and Pauline Moran an infraordinary

Kathryn Osterman presents her second
sketch and proves herself pleasing. There
is an idea in the skit that is decidedly
original and fairly well handled until the
time comes for untangling the complica

up with some skill, but In getting them
out of their difficulties he has apparently
resorted to the first expedient that came
to hand. . ,
"To-Morrow at Twelve." as the sketch
is called, has to do with two art students,
who ply their craft in the same studio.

false that they deserve comment and need

SMITH DIVORCE
INVOLVES A BIG
CHURCH SCANDAL
Accused Wife Arrives From
Nebraska to Defend Her
Good Name.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, March 2.
Â¦ Mrs. Laura Smith, who is being sued
for a divorce by Rev. Guy.W.* Smith,
pastor of the First Christian Church, on
the ostensible ground of desertion, has
arrived from her Kebraskan home and
threatens to fight the suit. She is at
present sojourning 1 at the home of her
husband's father at Pacific Grove, and if
the suit comes to trial it will prove most
sensational, involving a Xebraskan church
scandal.
It was published some time ago that the
alleged ground of desertion was but a
ruse, that the main cause was that -the
parties had discovered they were blood
relatlpnsâ that they were cousins. These
facts were vouched for by Rev. Mr. Smith
and. the public was compelled to-be con
tent with the statements.

FOUR CHOICES
FISH FIRST
AT OAKLAND
Castake Led in Some Slow
Ones at Good Odds and
Heavily Supported.
Matt Hogan Defeated Orionâ Game
Warden Beat a Big Field of
Followers of favorites undoubtedly salt
ed away some coin at the track over the
bay yesterday, as four well-played ones
reached the wire first. Of the other two
winners, Castake in the mile and a six
teenth run carried more support than
either the first or second choices. Backed
down from 6 to 4^, W. L. Stanfield's geld
ing sailed away In the lead and, strangely
enough, was only asked to beat Einstein,
a rank outsider, at the end. The latter
came to life so suddenly that the judges
ordered his entry refused in future at
Oakland, Wyoming, the favorite, ran
third, and Perseus, second in demand,
fourth.
Ivy Powell landed Mountebank winner
of the opening event, at odds of 9 to 2.
Louise Hayman, the Dallas stable repre
sentative, showed a high turn of speed,
leading to the stretch, where she "blew
up." Mountebank then won cleverly from
the favorite. Coming Event.
Matt Hogan, a 6 to 5 favorite, captured
the six furlong sprint that followed. After
Mafada had led to the bend for home
Orion, a 10 to 1 outsider, took up the run
ning and In a long, hard drive was beaten
but a neck. Morse kept Mafada going
long enough to take the show.
The firm of Burns & Waterhouse cap
tured the two-year-old scramble with
Game Warden,, which went to the post an
9 to 5 choice. Follow Me, a 60 to 1 shot,
led the bunch for half the way, when he
dropped back. By dint of hard riding
Thorpe reached the wire first a length
ahead of Aphrodls. Glrly Ducat was a
close third.
Florabinf carried the smart money In the
fourth number, winning easily. Rachel C,
which opened favorite, received a wretch
ed ride, losing the place to Waterwlck.
The final six furlong spin went to Re
vanna, the favorite. True Blue downed
Peace for the place.

To his disgust and dismay the men who
asked for the reopening of Ingleside re

of the legitimate horsemen for j a short

Dr. Edwin E. Hill, ' ex-Coroner of the
city and county, has been ordered- by
Judge Bahrs to pay his wife, Mrs. Mary
Hill. $75 a month during the pendency of
her action against him for maintenance.
A short time ago Dr. Hill filed suit
against his wife to set aside certain deeds,
on the ground that they were placed in
her hands in trust and that she refused
to reconvey them on demand. Mrs. Hill
forthwith sued her husband for mainte
nance, and the action was partly heard
yesterday. Mrs. Hill admitted that her
husband had paid some of -her bills, but
contended that the sum he gave her was
inadequate for her support. Judge Bahrs
said that the testimony satisfied him that
Mrs. Hill was entitled to -alimony, pen
dente lite, and in addition allowed Mrs.
Hill $100 for counsel fees and $50 costs.

EMPORIUM ROBBERS

Near San Mateo. .';'â¢Â¦
The police are still looking for Bryan
and Bernard, who gof.away with a'largc
sum of money from the Emporium, where
they were employed. It Is believed that
they are in hiding not far from this city,
and their capture is momentarily expected
by Chief Sullivan.
Burnett Sheehan of 1197 Bush street,
who is a grandson of ex-Judge Wallace,
reported to the police yesterday that' while
he was picking popples in San Mateo
County, near the Union Coursing Park,
about half a mile from the electric car
line as it passes to the park, .yesterday
morning he saw two young men sitting on
the- ground: -One of them called to him.
and said. "Here, sonny, get me a paper,
will you?" Sheehan replied that he did
not know where to get a' paper; and then
the man said: "All right; we will get one."
Then the man asked him it the Emporium
was closed to-day. , Sheehan said he did
not .know. Then the second man. said to
Sheehan: "Don't say anything about this,
now." Sheehan then became frightened
and walked away, and when- he waa a
short distance from the men he heard on*
of them say: "Hurry up, now; hurry up."
Sheehan looked back once and saw - the
two men standing up, facing away from
San Francisco. Â¦Â¦
Sheehan says the man who did moyt of
the talking to hhn looked like the picture
of Bernard shown him by the police. That
man had dark curly hair, dark gray,
trousers with holes in them, shoes without
strings, dark complexion, dirty face; black
soft shirt, sleeves ripped, brown soft hat
with full .crown. The second man wore
blue overalls, all torn;. white shirt, Com
plexion and- hair lighter than the other,
man and stouter. Both men were about
five feet nine or ten' inches^ Each man
carried a sack on his back. The men were
putting on false mustaches when He lirst
saw them. " Wren and Dinan -were at once
dispatched' to the scene, Â»but up "to a iatÂ«*

ADVERTISEMENTS.
coin has been actually collected from the
banks on which the urait.s are drawn. It
has been the custom upon receipt of these
checks to pin them to the tax bills they
are intended to settle, and pending their
collection and ' for' the lack of a. better
place' to put them they have been thrown
into a waste paper basket attached to the
counter near the cashier's desk.
Took Checks While Curtaz Figured.
Quite a number of checks were taken in
Thursday by Cashier Curtaz, and when
the lime arrived to balance his accounts
for the day -the waste basket contained
paper representing teverai thousand dol
iars. â¢ ZZ4,<-"- .
â¢While Mr.. Curtaz . was busy adding a
column of figures the new Janitor put in
an appearance. He was intent upon mak
ing a. record and boasted that he was go
ing to keep the Tax Collector's office
cleaner and neater than any other depart
ment in the building. ' -.--.
TneV baskf tiul ot checks was the first
thing that attracted his attention. .He
lifted it from its hook, dumped its con
tf-nts :into the furnace in tlie basement
and returned it to its 'peg without being
noticed. Then he went about raising the
dust in total ignorance of the fact that he
had consigned a small fortune to the fire.
The Loss Discovered.
It was not until Curtaz prepared to lock
up for the night that the olunder was dis
covered. When he peered into the waste
basket and saw no checks his hair stood
up and he had to grasp the coupter for
support. Inquiries were made of the of
fice force, but none of the clerks knew a
thing about the checks. The banks and
the Clearing-house were hurriedly noti
fied of the loss, and for a time it was
thought that the Tax Collector's office had
been robbed.
A force of clerks was put to work
checking up the tax stubs to ascertain the
amount of the loss and the names of the
taxpayers whose checks were missing.
The task was nearly completed when th*,
record-breaking Janitor was questioned.
It was thought that he might possibly
have seen some stranger around the office
whose description might lead to the detec
tion of the supposed thief.
Janitor Confesses.
The Janitor had seen no suspicious
Btranger and knew nothing about any
checks. Then he was shown the basket
from which it was thought the precious
paper had been abstracted.
His confession and a tableau followed.
All the taxpayers whose checks wen
burned were informed bright and early
yesterday morning. Several of them
drew new drafts during the day and set
tled their accounts. Others are expected
to do likewise to-day. A fresh janitor
took charge of Mr. Scott's office yester
day. .
The Tax Collector says that the blunder
wus almost inexcusable, and that while Ix.
caused him the loss of considerable sleep
it will be straightened out without injury
or inconvenience to any one.
WHETHER Slmpton of Sausallto
is a perjurer or a saint Is- the
question now before the Grand
Jury. The Inquisitorial body
.commenced an investigation
yesterday afternoon of the sensational
charges and counter-charges growing out
of the Craven-Fair litigation now pending
before Judge Troutt and in which is- in

adviser and guardian, and Mrs. Nettie R.

One Oath Too Many.
;As Slmpton has sworn to two state
mentsâone that he did and the. other that
he did not perform a marriage ceremony
making Senator Fair arid Nettie Craven
man and. wifeâ it would appear that from
any point of view he has taken an oath
once too often. If his latter story that
Mrs. Craven-Fair offered him a bribe to
swear to his first declaration is true and
the Grand Jury takes that view of it,' the
central figure in the Craven-Fair litiga
tion stands a chance of being forced to
defend herself in a criminal- action. On
the contrary, if her story is given credr
ence, all the Fair attorneys, all the Fair
heirs and all the friends, acquaintances
and employes of the Fair heirs and Fair
attorneys may awaken some morning and
find themselves In jail, for she says .they
are all conspirators, striving to crush her

was such that it should be watched, but
being watched is just what the gamblers
do not want. But when the provision
giving to any and every association that
asks the privilege of racing and gamb
ling was read the gamblers said nothing.
This concession was something more than
they had dared to ask. The resolution is
carefully worded, and provides for con
tinuous racing and track gambling from
one end of the year to another. Such an
outrage has never before been attempted
upon the' people of San Francisco.
Competent lawyers have looked into the
matter and they are of one opinion that
the ordinance provides for continuous rac
ing. And this is the measure that Tobin
uses as his first distinctive act and policy
in public life. It is charitable to believe
that .he has been made the victim of
some crafty schemer's _ imposition. The
proposed law In whatever aspect it may
be. viewed is simply intended to create
for the local and Eastern track gamblers
a monopoly of their vicious and criminal
trade in San Francisco, shutting out all
other gamblers and giving to the Ingle
side sharpers the entire field in which
to pluck the' gullible and ruin the un
wary.-
It is little wonder therefore that the
community is aroused in protest and in
dignation. The boasted reforms of char
ter administration are turning into the
reality of new evils and greater outrages
upon the city. The promise of an honest
and decent government is being made in
the fulfillment of public crimes. The re
establlshment of Ingleside means an in
flux of Eastern gamblers to this city, an
increase in dives and public immorality,
a tremendous stimulus given to crime
and new temptation placed in the way of.
the youth of this city. For these reasons
the men of business, merchants, com
mercial-men, bankers and tradesmen are
emphatically in opposition' to the out
rageous proposal. Ministers, clergymen,
men of affairs, people who are in touch
with the moral currents of the city are
raising their voices and exercising their
influence in protest. One class of men
sees the terrible loss that will be inflicted
on the city in thefts of money and the
trial of criminals. Another class know*
of the far greater evil of wrecked and
dishonored lives, homes destroyed, fam
ilies disgraced and men led to the pen
itentiary or the morgue.
And the men who are making these pro
tests insist upon being heard. They will
appear before the entire board on Mon-

day to state their cause and plead that
the welfare of the city be not Jeopardlzea
by this far-reaching and powerfully vi
cious institution. The men who will plead
will have much on their â¢ side. They will
have the support* of the Mayor, who is
an open, aggressive and uncompromising
opponent of public gambling. They will
have: the recorded admission of Super
visor Tobin himself that the racecourse
is a great.; evil, which needs constant
municipal supervision and regulation.
They will have the admission of the peti
tioners that they represent nothing but
that which means profit to them through
the bookmakers and through them the
deluded public. . â¢"' . . _
. The men who will plead to _ the Super
visors not to disgrace themselves and dis
honor their administration can: say that
the advocates of the proposed measure do
not represent a single horseman or
breeder or legitimate sport. Armed with
these arguments they will have Â¦ influence
before the board and may be sure that
they will be received with that considera
tion to which their cause is entitled.
WHO PAYS THE LICENSE?
HTHE only argument of -
JL fered in defense of the
revival of the gambling den.
of Ingleside is that the city
will be made richer by $4000
a year in licenses. Ingleside
has already, cost the people of
San Francisco a sum reach
ing into the hundreds' of
thousands of dollars in the
trial of men alone zvho
owed their downfall to the
snares 'and temptations of
the track. Leaving utterly
out of consideration the :
enormous amount of money
which has been stolen from
public offices and private
firms the municipality has
suffered a tremendous loss.
Is a repetition of the outrage
worth the price?

â¢-: constantly changing and early corners will have the E
I best chance to secure what they want, you cannot ; B
I fail to find something; you need here, for the stock ; 1
