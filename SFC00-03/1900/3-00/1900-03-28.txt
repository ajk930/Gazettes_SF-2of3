CONTINUED BOMBARDMENT
OF BESIEGED MAFEKING
MAFEKING. March H.â The Boers re
commenced the bombardment of this place
March 12, a six-Inch gun which had been
comparatively silent for a week firing the
ehrapnel used against the troops in the
open. The projectiles were ineffectual
against cover, but were dangerous to pe
destrians. One shell bu*t in the court
bouse, killing several natives and wound
ing four persons. Several women were
also slightly wounded. The steel plate of
the shell passed through the hotel office
and spent Itself beneath a table, where It
was scrambled for by employes. Another
Ehrapnel ebell burst above the bomb
proof occupied by the Reuter Telegram
Company's correspondent and sprinkled
the wall with bullets.
There has been little development since
the dispatch of March 10. A detachment
of colonial nati\es commanded by Mac
kenzie advanced to Jackal Tree Fort, the
position originally occupied by the siege
run, on the southwestern heights, but the
Boers discovered the plans and evacuated
it. Previously a detachment of Barrelong
natives had been dispatched against a new
fort threatening our western position and
succeeded in creeping up to within a few
yards of the sleeping Boers outside and in
ijie rear of the fort. They fired three vol
leys and then retreated in accordance
with their instructions. Sunday. March 11.
Â¦was observed as a truce. The British
troops eat on the parapets conversing with

maintained until dark.

The counsel for the defense held a consul
tation, after which ex-Governor Brown
announced that no testimony would be
introduced for the defense and that he
would waive further examination.
The pardon Issued to Powers by Gov
ernor Taylor was then tendered by ex-
Governor Brown. as a bar to the prosecu
tion, and he asked that the 'defendant be
dismissed. Colonel Campbell said the
Commonwealth denied Governor Taylor's
right to Issue a pardon at the tme it was
granted. Governor Brown moved that the
prisoner be dismissed upon the evidence,
but the motion was overruled. ' -?
Bail was then asked for.
Judge Moore said: "It Is not my belief
that Powers fired the shot which killed
Governor Goebel. but, from the evidence,
it is my opinion that he was connected
with the conspiracy to kill him. I shall
therefore order, that he be hel<? over with
out bail to the Franklin County Grand
Jury that the case may be further inves

that the cases of Captain John Dans and
William H. Culton. who are also charged
with being accessories to the murder, be

figures, however, do not make evident the

had at the time only twenty-four officers
and 1600 men fit. for duty out of a total of
thirty-seven officers and 3000 men. Hard
marching, bivouacks in the open and other

INTERSTATE
COMMISSION IN
SESSION AGAIN
Hearing of Two Important
Cases Is Commenced in
Los Angeles.
Complaints of the St. Louis Business
Men's League and the Shippers
of Citrus Fruits to Be
Passed Upon.
IjOS ANGELES. March 27.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission began the
hearing of two important coast freight
problems in the Federal courtroom at 11
o'clock this morning. To-day's proceed
ings concerned the complaint of the St.
Louis Business Men's League against the
transcontinental roads. About three years
ago the roads greatly increased the differ
ence between carload freight rates to the
I coast and rates for broken carioads. This
! action was favorable to coast jobbers and
I against Eastern Jobbers, and after con-
I sWerable discussion the league named
I filed a complaint against the roads, asking
for a reduction in the difference between
the two rates. At 6t. Louis last Novem
ber the complaints were heard, and to-day
the defence was given an opportunity to
rebut the complaint. After the session
here the Commissioners will give another
nearing in San Francisco.
To-morrow morning the complaint of
the shippers of citrus fruits against the
i Southern Pacific and Santa Fe roads will
'be given a hearing. These complaints are
j four in number and relate to the lnde-
I pendent fruit express lines, the object of
! the complaint being to annul contracts
I existing Detween three car lines whereby
I other snippers are barred from the roads.
The complainants In this case are the Con
solidated Forwarding Company and the
Southern California Fruit Exchange, rep
resenting a large portion of the Â¦ citrus
fruits of Southern California. The vari
ous interests are represented by attorneys.
Judson C. Clements presidea, the other
Commissioners present being J. D. Teo
mans and J. W. Fifer.
Will A. Harris, representing the Santa
Ana Chamber of Commerce, asked to In
tervene In the St. Louis case against ter
minal differentials, permission being re
' The first witness called by the Pacific
Coast Jobbers' Association was F. W.
Braun, a wholesale druggist of Los An
geles, who testified as to his experience
as an importer, of goods from Europe and
Eastern States. He stated that he found
It Impossible to do a large business in New
Mexico, finding that he can go but three
tenths of the distance to St. Louis until
the freight advantages of the latter city
prohibit the extending of bis business. He
added that in consequence of freight ad
vantages enjoyed by the Middle West his
purchases of goods in that section have
very materially Increased In the past five
years. Local jobbers, he stated, now meet
with keen competition from the jobbers of
the Middle West, that competition , affect
ing prices, profits on many goods being
less than the actual differentials. A
change in these freight rates would com
pel him to buy a number of articles In
Europe Instead of the Middle West.
After the noon recess cross-examination
of the witness continued, the -defense
maintaining that the contention of the St.-
Louis merchants 1b for a lower rate to
Intermediate points than to Los Angeles,
which, the witness said, would be a.se
rious menace -to his business. - Â¦ :
W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific
participated in questioning the witness,
the contention of that road being that it
Is Impossible to grant" lower rates -from
the Middle West to California than those
from the Atlantic to the coast, "as It , is
necessary for the road to get revenue
from some source." as he explained, "the
transcontinental rates "being governed by
ocean rates." . Â¦ . .
J. A. Lothian,. local manager of W. P.
Fuller & Co.. was called to the witness
stand, testifying. to Â¦ the ; effect of the
freight rates on oil, glass and paints. ' He
eaid that his house could not sell goods
east of Lordsburg.'New Mex.. because of
freight rates beyond Â¦ that point being- .; In
favor of St. Louis. He did not believe ' It

NEW MILITARY
DIVISIONS IN
PHILIPPINES
Changes Relieve Otis of
Many Minor Details of
Command.
Judge Taft Calls His Commission
Together and the Members Dis
cuss the Flans and Scope
of Operations.
Â«
WASHINGTON. March 27.â Secretary
Root took a step long contemplated In
the,' administration of the Philippines by
directing the creation of an entirely new
military division to be. known as "the
division of the Pacific," embracing _ all
of the Philippine archipelago. The divis
ion in turn Is to be divided into four mili
tary departments as follows: The De-
Eartment of Northern Luzon, commanded
>y General Bates: the Department of the
Viscayas, commanded by General Hushes,
and the Department of Mindanao and
Jolo, commanded by General Kobbe.
Major General Otis will retain the su
preme command over these departments
as division commander, occupying toward
them a position corresponding closely Ito
that occupied by General Miles - toward
the military departments In the United
States. It Is said at the War Department
that * the purpose of the new order of
things Is to free General Otis of many
minor details Incident to the administra
tion of the islands, leaving him at liberty
to devote more time to large questions
of policy and civil 'administration.
Commission Meets.
The new Philippine Commission held a
preliminary meeting to-day at the.head
quarters of the old commission on Ver
mont avenue. Judge Taft, the president,
called the body- to -order and the plans
for the movements of the committee were
thoroughly canvassed.' Upon reassembling
the commission proceeded in a' body to
the War Department to pay their respect 3
to Secretary Root. Unlike the first com
mission, which received Instructions di
rectly from the State Department and re
ported through that department, this
commission will deal' solely with the War
Department. - .- -t -â¢Â¦; â¢â¢--**Â£**
Â¦ Secretary Root welcomed i the commis
sion and Jn answer to their question as
to when they . might expect to receive
their instructions, suggested that they as

pected ' to be able to communicate with
them further. -SSSBSSKSS*

WASHINGTON. March rT.-Secretary
Hay to-<iay sutn-Jtted to Congress the
correspondence had with the governments
of other nations respecting the mainte
nance of *.n "open door" in China. The
correspondence extended over a period
from September last to the 20th lnst.. the
' last date marking the successful comple

dressed on this tubject by the United
States were Great Britain. France. Ger

On September â¬ tfce State Department
addressed our Ercbassadors at London,
Berlin and St. Petersburg copies of a
"formal declaration" setting out the de
sires of our Government in the matter of
the "open door." Italy and Japan were
similarly addressed about a month later.
While the "lormal declarations" sent to
the Einbassadors were similar in each
case, yet each of the officer* adopted a
dirTere-:t phraseology in addressing them
teves to the goverr.mer.ts to which they
are accredited, the dominant note being
best set forth, perhaps, m the form of
conveyance chosen oy Embassador

that England subscribe:

. Just a week after the receipt of this
important communication Lord Salisbury
tckn-owledged its receipt in a note, prom

vocated by this country is one of securing
equal opportunity for the subjects ana

policy her Majesty's Government has no

Judson Seager. local manager of the
Crane Company, said that his house had
not been able to do business east of Ari
zona because of freight rates. He declared
that the differentials exceed the profits on
the goods. The price of goods Is fixed by
Eastern competition, and in case of the
wiping out of differentials his house would
be forced to ship mainly by water or
would eventually be forced to close Its
doors In this city and would rely on trav
eling representatives of Eastern branches
of the house.
H. C. Reynolds of the Harper & Rey
nolds Company, hardware dealers, testi
fied that his company ships a large por
tion of its goods by vessel from the Atlan
tic coast. It is possible for his house to
do business as far south as Guaymas, on
account of water transportation, but
freight rates prevent shipment further
east than Arizona. A large increase has
taken place In purchases in the Middle
West during the past few years, while
trade with the Atlantic coast has dimin
ished. His house encounters competlton
from the Atlantic, but not so sharp as
that from the Middle West. He thought
that the annulling of differentials would
greatly Interfere with his business, forc
ing heavier shipment by water from the
Atlantic coast. The local rates per mile
going East are higher than those coming 1
West, giving Eastern dealers a large ad
vantage, which has resulted in driving his

"KID" PEEPLES SLIDES TO
SECOND BASE.
IBERG READY TO LAUNCH
THE BALL.
THE opening of the baseball season
always recalls Colonel T. "Prunes"
Robinson and the great parades he
gave in the halcyon days of the na
tional game. Manager "Hank" Harris
and other magnates Interested in the Cali
fornia League do not contemplate march
ing at the head of their picturesque play
ers, as they care more to give the public
the best quality of baseball than circus-
show parade.
On Sunday afternoon the initial game or
the season of 1500 will be played at Rec
reation Park, corner of Eighth and Har
rison streets. The San Franclscos and
the Oaklands will start the ball rolling
and the spheroid will not stop until a
pennant winner is developed. The game
will bring out the "fans, who will howl
and kick at good and bad plays and de
cisions and try to keep warm. "Uncle
INDIANS THREATEN TO
GO ON THE WARPATH
Roughly Handle a Teacher and
Threaten to Take the Life of the
Agent of the Reservation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE. Idaho. March 27.â Fifty armed
and painted Indians of the Lernhi reser
vation have defied the authority of Agent
Yearian. who is cordially hated by moet
of the braves on the reservation. Trouble
has been brewing for some time and it
was feared there would be open war when
fifty of the ?Â» warriors on the reservation
painted and armed, tore down aa ob
jectionable fence which the agent had
built. The agent was warned by one of
the Indian school boys not to Interfere
with the Indians or they would kill him,
so be discreetly locked himself up In his
house. One cf the Indian scholars was
corrected by one of the teachers. Miss
Lyons, and she received rough treatment
at the hands of one of the chiefs. Other
occurrences have served to arouse the
Indians and serious trouble Is feared, al
though the Indians appeared to have
abandoned any idea of bloodshed, if they
entertained such after they tore down the
fence.
Agent Yearian has placed the matter
before the department. If the Indians
should decide to go on the warpath they
could kill ail the defenseless settlers be
fore troops could fee g-ot to the scene.

SEATTLE INFESTED WITH
MANY HARD CITIZENS
Bush, to Cape Nome Brings an Tnflnx
cf an Undesirable Element,
. Causing Police to Act.
SEATTLE. March J7.â The fact that a
saloon was held up, that a citizen had a
bloody struggle with a burglar who used
a razor, and that a murder and suicide
were attempted Sunday night within four
hours of each other, caused Mayor Humes
yesterday to declare that an "emergency
exists that demands additional police pro
tection, and the Chief of Police was au
thorized to appoint ten additional police
men. A week ago the force was Increased
by the same number.
Mayor Humes says that the Cape Xome
rush has brought with it a large number
of criminals, and thai he proposes to rid
the town of their presence. Last night the
city Jail was filled with suspicious char
acters.
The Chief of Police ordered that no more
prizefights be allowed in the city. Public
gambling has also been suppressed.
LIBERIAN REPUBLIC

LONDON', March 27.â Ma1l advices re
celTed here from Monrovia, the capital
of the African republic of Liberia, an
nounces the destruction of the Llberian
navy, consisting: of two gunboats. The
Rocktown was sunk In the harbor of Mon
rovia on March 10, while the Gorronomah
was capsired in the St. Paul River, where
she was going to be overhauled. The loss
cf the gunboats which cost about $149.

unable to replace them.
Drops Deed in His Garden.
Special Dispatch to The Call
MARYSVILLE, March 77. â Adams
Hubbs. a pioneer resident of Sutter Coun
ty, dropped dead last evening at his home
near Pennington while mowing grass in
the garden. He came to this section from
Canada In 1554. A widow and five children
survive him. He was 72 years of age.
Henry" promises a good sample of ball
playing for the opening contest. He has
nad his young men cavorting around the
diamond every afternoon during the past
two weeks, and now all they need is to
trim their batting "lamps" and they will
be ready to create great dust on the dia
mond. â¢ Â¦ .
Manager Harris thinks he has strength
ened his team by the acquisition of two
new men. One of them is Cnarley
Schwartz, an athletic representative or.
the Canadian League, who is to perform
behind the bat. Schwartz is a likely look
ing man and shows up well in practice.
He has a batting record of .314. which h<s
expects to materially improve before the
end of the season. He played ball with
Petey Lohman and the latter bad such a
high opinion of his ability that -ie placed
every obstacle, in Schwartz's path in the
hope of retaining him for hi 3 team. Spen
cer, the new shortstop, has not arrived
and it is likely that "Kid" Peeples will fill
his place in the opening game.
The "small boy" is happy in the knowl
edge that Rube Levy, their hero and de
light, will don a baseball suit again. In
the old days at the Haight-street grounds
Rube used to entertain the inhabitants or
the bleachers with fairy tales while wait-
Ing for the ball to fly his way. Rube has
shown up well in practice and will in all
probability play left field, his old position,
for your "Lncle Henry." _^
In the opening game the local team will
probably be made up of Iburg. Schwartz,
Reilly. 'Brockhoff. Peeples. Levy. Krug
and HUderbrand. Oakland will turn out
the following aggregation: Steffanl, Ham
mond. Franks, Lange, Schmeer, Moski
roan, Drennan and Dunleavy.
FRFSNO. March 27.â Word was received this morning that a desperate
finmkea affray occurred last night in the mountains back of Sanger among
a tribe of Indians, and that two squaws were killed by them. The Indians
are stid to be surrounded in a cabin by a Constables posse from Sanger,
and tle question is whether the besieged shall be burned out or whether to
await reinforcements and make an assault on the cabin. The locality of the
siege Is on the road to Trimmers Springs, back in the mountains.

THE interesting operation of . trans

has Just been accomplished In New

formed in gold for. the Paris Exposition.
The figure is nearly six . feet - high and
weighs 700 pounds. The gold jis fourteen

$160,000. , ,
It is. the only solid gold statue in exist
ence. The statue will typify ','An Ameri

Miss Adams was chosen as the model
last summer, and Miss Bessie O. Potter
made the original figure. So at least says
the firm which has developed the scheme.
It would require the wildest imagination
to discover the trace of a likeness.
- The gold bricks or ingots were sent from
the assay office on Thursday. They were
carefully guarded by two detectives.
A - mold of the model ,. was . made in
French clay. Meanwhile ' the gold was
simmering in fiery retorts. When it was
ln liquid form it was poured Into the mold
In a most unceremonious sort ot way by
the workmen. After the. Paris Exposition
the statue will be exhibited ln the large
American cities. The promoters had in
mind the money made out of the Ada
Rehan silver statue shown at the World's
Fair.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 27.âRepresenta
tive Needham to-day conferred with First
Assistant Postmaster General Heath re
garding free delivery service In the cities
of his district. He learned that Visalia
was the only city which had any prospect
of free delivery. The requirements of the
law are that the cross receipts of the post
office must be at least $10,000 a year. The
gross receipts of the Visalia office for the
first half of the present fiscal year>were
HjOO. Mr. Needham Informed the depart
ment that' Visalia was growing ' rapidly
and the postal receipts were bound to In
crease In proportion, and he requested
that the office be examined with the view
of ascertaining the probable increase In
the receipts during the remainder of the
fiscal year. General Heath immediately
telegraphed to the Visalia office for this
information and for the figures of the re
, celpts for March. If the result is satis
factory to the- department an inspector
will be sent to Visalia to investigate and
report, with a view of establishing a free
delivery system there. â¢
Mr. Kahn to-day received a letter from
the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
requesting him to use his best efforts to
have one member of the Board of General
Appraisers, whose headquarters is in New
York, assigned permanently to San Fran
cisco. Mr. Kahn conferred with the treas
ury officials and was Informed that the
proposed arrangement was not practica
ble. Many simliar requests have come to
the Treasury Department from the large
cities of the country, but the department
has determined that the best interests of
the Government demand that the Board
of General Appraisers sit permanently in
New York, Individual members making
visits to such sections of the country as
the interests of the service from time to
time demand. One member is now on his
way to San Francisco on business of the
Board of Appraisers.
Chairman Cooper of the House Commit
tee on Insular Affairs to-day assured
Representative Kahn of a hearing next
Friday on Kahn's bill providing for a
library at Manila and appropriating $5000
therefor.

CHICAGO'S MAYOR WILL
PREVENT THE FIGHTS
Declares Jeffries Shall Not Enter the
Ring With Three , Men in
One Night.
CHICAGO, March 27.â Mayor Harrison
ha* determined to land a knockout blow
on the proposition. to let James J. Jeffries,
fistic champion of the' world, try conclu
sions with three men atiTattersall's. The
Mayor Insists that Jeffries must box six
rounds with one opponent or -not put on
the gloves at all. Â¦ 'Â¦ . ?
"I have given orders that the fights be
called off, eaid Mayor Harrison, "unless
Jeffries boxee -with Â¦ but Â¦" one %man \ and
keeps within tbellmlt of six rounds. I
understand that â¢; he is booked to 'go'
against three men on the same evening,
well, that simply means that they can let
him fight for eighteen roundsâ six rounds
to a fightâ and hammer 'these 'scrubs'
within an inch of their lives. I don't pro
pose to allow any of that sort of work.
If they want to give a boxing, exhibition
simply to show Jeffriei' cleverness, why,
all right, but In that event one man would
be sufficient, - and * they must not keep It
up for morÂ© than six rounds.. Unless this
demand Is followed there will be no fight

WIDE RANGE
OF THE DEBATE
IN TRE HOUSE
Porto Rican Tariff, Boer
War and Philippines
Discussed.
Consideration of the Army Appropri
ation Bill Affords an Oppor
tunity for Much
Oratory.
?
WASHINGTON. March 27.â There was
come lively debate In the House to-day
during th* consideration of the army ap
propriation bill. A little of It was perti
nent to the measure. It covered a wide
range of topicsâ the Porto Rlcan tariff,
the Boer war and the Philippines. The
charge that the Porto Rlcan tariff bill
was the result of a deal for raising a Re
publican campaign fund was again re
ferred to by Pierce of Tennessee, but
Hull declared that the anonymous author
of the charge would never dare to avow
himself and be branded as a falsifier.
Sulzrr of New York made an appeal for
the extension of official sympathy to the
BÂ«ers in their Btrupgle for independence,
and Ltntz of Ohio delivered a scathing
denunciation of militarism and the war in
the Philippines. His attack aroused the
Indignation of Marsh of Illinois, wlro In
a bitter excoriation of the Ohio member
declared the latter's speech was' a dis
prace to the American Congress. He de
clared that he was responsible for what
he had said both on and off the floor of
the House. His heated language did not
draw a rejoinder from Lentz.
Senate Makes Little Progress.
Little progress was made by the Sen-
Etc to-day with the Porto Rican tariff
and government bill. It was under dis
cussion for nearly three hours, but the
greater part of the time was consumed
in the consideration of a free coinage
amendment offered by Morgan. The
amendment is still pending. The Alas
kan civil oode bill was considered dur
ing the morning hour. An amendment
offered by Carter setting aside permits
hitherto granted by the Secretary of War
for the mining of gold under the sea on
the Alaskan coast precipitated a lively de
bate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 1900.
GREAT DAY FOR
LONG SHOTS AT
OAKLAND TRACK
â ? .
Bagdad, Laura Marie, Glen
Anne Finish First at
Lengthy Odds.
The sport at Oakland yesterday was
! one big blow-out and celebration for out
siders in the betting. Backers of favor
[ Hes early took on a saffron hue, looking
; as if they had been feasting on a diet of
j embalmed beef. Bagdad set the ball in
motion, then skipping one Laura Made
stepped home at fancy odds. Next Glen
I Anne nosed out Lena with 30 and 40 to 1
i about her In the ring, followed by the
| victories of Gotobed and Momentum at
; mellow prices. Of the different winners
; Laura Marie, the two-year-old, and.Mo
, mentum were the only ones to command
any noticeable amount. of support.
Bagdad, a 15 to 1 outsider, captured the
first event from a field of cheap ones, for
which Dreadnaught II was installed fa
vorite at post time. Bassinger, who rode
the long shot, shook his field oft in the
stretch, beating out Garbo over a length.
, Harry Thatcher, which .opened first
choice, failed to show any speed.
Alter an absence from turf circles for
some weeks, "Daggie" Smith's mare Tor
slda came from her retirement and
downed a ragged bunch of platers in the
second number. Three to' four looked a
liberal price and she won all the way.
Chappie, a 75 to 1 shot, finished strong,
getting the place from -Los Prletos.
Lucidta was installed a 4 to 5 chance for
the two-year-old scramble, and. after
showing speed for a quarter of a mile
flattened out completely. Laura Marie,
ridden by Eddie Ross, then won very han
dily f rom â¢ Intrepido and the favorite. El :
Karn, an outsider, ran as if his future
races would bear watching.'
The ring laid a very short price about
Obsidian in the betting on the mile selling
run, and a raft of coin was lost on his
poor showing. Loading to the paddock,
the brown horse there went all to pieces,
running unplaced. In a very close finish
Bozeman landed the' 3o to 1 shot. Glen
Ann, first, a nose before Lena. Sorrow,
after running second the entire route,
j took show honors.
Johnny Coffey's mare Rosinante again
played out of luck in the mile and a six
teenth run, finishing third after a stormy
passage. A sixteenth from the stand
Malay seemed to have the purse in sight,
when Powell, astride Gotobed, came with
a rush, downing Dr. Kowell's horse a
length.
Don Cameron's Flamero was backed
down to favoritism in the betting on the
last race, with a smart play on both Mo
mentum and Merry Boy. The latter horse
took the lead from Jingle Jingle at the
stretch turn, only' to be passed in turn
and led out a. head by, Momentum, excel
lently ridden by Piggott.
Track Notes.
The Judges were not satisfied with the
showing made, by Lucldia and suspended
Hennessy, who rode the filly, pending fur
ther investigation.
A little "spiel" from the stand now and
th6n works wonders with some -of the
saddle talent. Ivy Powell, a very capable
lightweight, was hard to keep outside of
the money yesterday.
J. W. O'Nell & Co., owners of Gussie
Fay and the fast Frank Bell, ship their
horses East on Thursday.

Forty-ninth Infantry Is to be court-mar r
tialed for discourtesy and- disrespect to
Archbishop Chapelle on the way to Manila
is not given much credence in army circles
here. In the first place, it Is said on all
sides that Klrkman is not that kind of
a' man, and again, that discourtesy of the
kind alleged is not fit grounds for a court
martial. . i: 3(S^tfi
! That there was some friction between
the Archbishop and . the major* even
before the transport left this port Is
well known. Archbishop Chapelle,
with three priests, one of whom was
Father McKinnon, went down to the
islands on the Sherman. The Sherman,
besides some casual troops, carried a bat
talion of the Forty-ninth Infantry, under
command of Major Kirkman,: who : was
senior '.officer on board and consequently
in command. Just before the - Sherman
left the*- dock Archbishop ., Chapelle, with
his attendants, came on board, ; and after
looking around, he selected the quarters
of the commanding officer, - Major Kirk
man's stateroom and office, and took pos
session: His baggage was moved in .at
once and he made himself comfortable. /
Major Klrkman was busy, with the work
of getting the troops assigned to quarters
and the hundred and one other things at
tendant Â¦ upon the , sailing of a Â¦ transport,
and he did not see what was going on un
til just as the; lines were cast off. When
the last person left him he was on his way
to order the Archbishop's baggage to be
removed to -the quarters provided for. him
and he himself notified that he -would
have to- vacate the quarters of the com
manding officer. . ,
What happened after that Is not known
here, for Â» the Â¦ ship drew out : into the
stream, and whatever else passed was on
blue water;: nor has any one who was on
board on that \ trip returned '.to tell. It is
certain," however, â¢ that between the "Arch
bishop and" the major there was a coolness
that made Intercourse between them only
of j the "most, formal; kind, and it may. be
that* there was " some .Incident "which has
called : for a court-jnartlal, . but it Is not
believed that the reason alleged is the
true one." :Â¦ . . Â¦Â¦ ;
Â¦: Orders for the men to leave for Manila
on the Grant are beginning to appear. She
will sail on the Ist, or perhaps on Satur
day next, with eighty Hospital Corps men, 4
a number of acting assistant surgeons and

* T 'n\e well known Channel Â¦ street tug
Amelia 1 is at the bottom of the bay, ana
just how the accident happened neither
captain nor owners can tell. The tug was
on her way to Kneiss' shipyard to tow
down a small schooner, but somehow
Captain ;Lucht- got In among the Â¦ Union
Iron Works Blips. . The tide was falling,
and before he Knew what had happened
the Amelia was hard and fast on the ways
laid down for one of the'new torpedo
boats. An upright piece of timber. driven
as a guide - when Â¦.. the ways , were -being
built held the tug upright for nearly hall
an hour, but when the tide left her high
and dry the strain became too great and
the Â« upright snapped. The Amelia then
rolled over and over and finally landed in
the mud at the , bottom of the bay. An
attempt will be made to get her up to-day.
Alec Helman, a sailor, lost' his life- In
the bay yesterday morning. He was re
covering from a protracted spree, and in
company with John Tulkala went down to
the steamer Del Norte to look for a Job.
He sat down on the rail of the vessel; and
losing his balance fell backward into the
bay. In his fall he struck his head against
the side of the ship and sank as soon as.
he entered the water. Late in Â¦ the after
noon the body was recovered and* taken
to the Morgue. .' .
Eddie Poole, a son of Sergeant , Poole of

follows. ' The -i second .-; bosun, "Yank"
Carpenter,- met * the \ pig \ in ; San '> Luis i de
Apra and took quitp a fancy to the ani
mal. He asked the price, and not having
enough | money appealed to Purser Frank
Bucklln and Commissary- Clerk Center.
These gentlemen advanced the necessary
funds and Carpenter purchased the pig
and brought him aboard the Warren.
Ever since "King Leary" has lived on the
fat of the land and once a day his faith
ful attendant gives him a bath. While
his Majesty was tin quarantine "Yank"
sent him over a sack' of meal to suppll
ment the rations issued by Dr. Klnyoun,
and when the pig was restored to the ship
the biVsun wept tears of Joy. Purser
Bucklin now asserts that half the pig is
his. Commissary Clerk Center lays claim
to ; the other half, while Boastwain Car
penter makes no bones about saying that
the King and his golden crown are his
and his alone. Until this dispute over the
ownership of his pigship Is settled, there
is no chance of the animal being put on
exhibition.
The little sloop Impossible has been
placed on the run between here and Bo

schooner Nettie Low, which capsized dur

Captain Jack Low Is having a new gaso

Is completed the Impossible will carry the
freight and passengers.
The brig Tanner came down from Val

street wharf. From here she goes to New
Whatcom to load lumber for Cape Nome.
The brig is under charter to the Klmball

The little fourteen-ton schooner Bonita

c~ Â»râ )HE method of looting the public
treasury by getting up a tremendous
R bubonic plague scare at an Imminent
risk of driving away trade and tour
ist travel did not originate, it seems, with
Mayor Phelan's Board of Health. They
even stole the idea. Advices received
from Honolulu by the steamer Australia
yesterday say that the taxpayers are In
dignant there over the enormous expense
to which they have been put to rid the
island of a few cases of the plague. It Is
stated that less than half of the deaths
attributed to the plague could really be
charged to that cause, while the others,
according to reputable physicians -who
attended them, were due to pneumonia
and kindred ailments.
Prince Cupid Kalamanaole, who came up
on the Australia, openly and emphatically
asserts that the evils of the plague have
been magnified by the Honolulu health
officers in order to loot the public treas
ury. "The whole .thing has been a great
rh&me," he said when seen at the Palace
Hotel last night, "and. some of the of
ficials are certainly lining their pockets
at the expense of the gullible public. It
Is true that there have been some cases
of bubonic plague in Honolulu, but the
disease was never epidemic, and if they
had been carefully and quietly handled
there would have been no burning of
blocks of houses and .military interfer
ence, giving rise to all sorts of newspaper
stories . spread broadcast over the world,
Injuring the trade and practically destroy
ing for years to come our great tourist
business. There has never Deen a time
that people could not have landed at and
left Honolulu In perfect security. The
loss of tourist trade means much to poor
Hawalians, who sold visitors native ar
ticles and took them about the islands as
guides. '.' . ";
"The taxpayer knows not yet the enor
mous cost entailed directly by the official
scare. Already $500,000 has been spent,
and the health officers are clamoring for
more, threatening another Â¦ 'quarantine'
and 'epidemic' When the taxpayers have
been mulcted to pay for the destruction
of Honolulu's Chinatown and other fire
damages they will then understand what
an expensive luxury a board of health is."
W. H. Mclnerney, a prominent mer
chant of Honolulu, who Is at the Occi
dental, In an interview. Intimated that
the state of things depicted by the Prince
actually does exist. He said that the
plague scare had been greatly exaggerat
ed and that very many cases reported to
be plague were nothing more than pneu
monia. He cited as one instance the case
of Herman Levy, chief clerk of the Ha
waiian Hotel, who was pronounced a
Elague victim and sent to the pesthouse.
everal prominent physicians said that
Levy had pneumonia and stuck to their
opinion. Levy Is getting well.
Much publicity was given to Levy's case
because he is a white man,- and the fact
that he was attacked by the plague could
be used as a lever to get more money
from the white taxpayers.
R. M. Meln of Oakland, who has Just
spent four months in Honolulu and re
turned home on the Australia, says the
opinion is becoming general In the island
metropolis that the Board of Health has
made much capital out of the plague
scarÂ© In order to loot the public treasury.
They are now laughing at the tax-eaten
people of San Francisca for falling such
easy victims to the same game. Â¦ ,

LATIN QUARTER NEXT.
Health Board Will Continue
Disinfecting Process in That
Locality.
The Board of Health held a special
meeting last night and decided to begin
its official inspection of the Latin quar
ter to-day. The session was a secret one,
but the main topic of discussion was the
announced intention of Supervisors Mc-
Carthy and Reed to oppose the granting
of any further funds In a fruitless -itfort
to discover the phantom plague. At its
conclusion Dr. Williamson stated that
whatever was discussed did not require a
vote, bo a public meeting was not held.
Health Officer Williamson said that the
work of cleaning out Chinatown would be
practically concluded this morning and a
number of the present sanitary inspectors
would be retained to visit the Latin quar
ter, which includes the district bounded
by Montgomery avenue, j Sacramento
street and the bay. The tactics employed
in Chinatown will be modified to a con
siderable extent, but the residents of that
locality will be required to place f their
dwellings in a sanitary condition. Chloride
of lime will be freely spread in the dis
trict. Asked as to how many lay inspect
ors would be retained to carry on the
work Dr. Williamson replied that he was
not prepared to say. There will be no
cordon established in the district and dur
ing the process of disinfection the resi
dents will be allowed to come and go.
Some of the Inspectors will be Imme
diately set to' work posting notices i n all
the underground lodgings of Chinatown
in accordance with a resolution recently
passed by the board suppressing them.
The notice, which is signed by the Health
Officer and secretary of the board. Is a.3

ANOTHER instance of ths incalculable harm to this city be
ing wrought by Mr. Hearst's yellow journalism, in dissem
inating false health reports, is afforded by the following article
which appeared in the Denver Republican on the 24th inst.:
TOURISTS FLEEING FROM
PLAGUE STRICKEN SAN FRANCISCO
Thousands are fleeing from the plague. That is the reason so many are
coming East who usually remain in California and along the Western
coast until a month later than they are staying this season. In these words
Sylvester Rogers of Albany, N. V., explained the fact that Denver hotels
and all the hotels at stopping places on the way East are now crowded
from basement to the roof, whereas the rush of travel from the West does
not ordinarily come until a month later than it has this year. "On the train
from San Francisco," said he at the Albany Hotel last evening, "I was
surprised at the large number of those with whom I conversed who frankly
admitted that they were simply fleeing from the Asiatic plague which, with
out -any doubt at all, is now to be found in San Francisco. It Is true
there may be only a few cases of the plague, but that there is even one
case Is enough to frighten away many tourists who, all their lives,' heard
of how deadly this plague is and how rapidly it spreads when Introduced
Into any country.
"Every precaution Is being taken, I have been informed, to guard against
its spread and even to make light of the fact that there are now cases of
plague In San Francisco, but Just think of the mortality which would re
sult from carrying the contagion to every part of the country by tourists
who have until a short time ago crowded the hostelrles of the principal
cities in the State. On the very train on which I came eastward there
was represented almost every State east of the Missouri. If on that train
or on any like train there was the least contagion the bubonic plague
would spring up in practically all the principal parts of the country sim
ultaneously. The danger, though small, is great . wuen the seriousness of
the disease- is taken into consideration. '/.';;
"The authorities in all probability will stamp out what little of It there
Is. In San Francisco, and prevent those affected from coming into the city,
but as we open our doors wider and wider to the East the danger will In
crease of allowing the plague to come in through the Golden. Gate along
with the commerce which comes from the same general locality as the
plague. Discretion, you know, is the better part of 'valor, and the scores,
the hundreds, who wrote that sentence in their copy books at school a gen
eration ago, are putting 5 it Into practice by shortening their stay on the
Western coast and hurrying home. I am one of the number."â Denver Re
publican, December 24. 1900.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call. - *
SAN JOSE, March 27.â A caae of too
much mother-in-law is the basis of a
complaint In a $20,000 damage suit filed In
the Superior Court to-day by Mrs. Emma
Grlbner against Mrs. Phlliplna Grlbner.
The complaint recites that prior to Janu
ary 21, laou, plaintiff lived with her hus
band at his mother's home on Willow
street in this city. - On that date things
had reached such a crisis she packed her
trunk and '.eft "because of his cruelty and
because of his threats to commit bodily
harm upon' her." But previous to that
time, dating as far back as November IS.'
lsS6, her mother-in-law, Mrs. Pnillplna
Uribner, had called plaintiff by vile and
vulgar names and opprobrious epithets.
On August 11, 1899, when plaintiff desired
.to take two young children of her husband
by a former wife out riding Mrs. Grlbner
attacked her and struck her several blows
with her fists. At that time the mother
in-law threatened to knock the plaintiff
down, ordered her away from the homo
and declared "I intend to make it as mis
erable as possible for you as long as you
stay here.
This belligerency on the part of the de
fendant, ... Mrs. Emma . Grlbner declares,
caused her a great nervous shock, from,
the effects of which she became ill. For
four weeks she was compelled to employ
a physician, and still continues to suffer
from the assault and battery. She places
the extent of her damage at $20,000. Mrs.
Clara Folta Is the attorney for plaintiff.
Mrs. Phillplna Gribner, the defendant.
Is the widow of George Grlbner; a pioneer,
and is worth over 1100,000. She Is nearly
SO years of age. Her son and plaintiff
were married about four years ago.
Mrs. Emma Grlbner also filed a suit
against her husband, George Grlbner. for
divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty.
She demands alimony and a division of
some property.

GOVERNMENT IN ALASKA
SENATOR CARTER has of late been making
earnest efforts to procure for the people of
Alaska something at least of the improvements
they have been asking for in their governmental sys
tem. The rapid increase of the white population
since the rich gold discoveries has brought about a
condition of affairs that cannot be properly controlled
under the existing forms of government, and as a re
sult there is a good deal of justifiable discontent with
the situation. . v
In commenting upon the urgent need of the
Alaskan code bill now before the Senate, Carter is
quoted as saying: "The district of Alaska has yielded
to the treasury of the United States and to the peo
ple of the country a million dollars for every thousand
invested in purchase, and is destined to be the great
unfailing gold supply for this country, I am anxious
to see the people of Porto. Rico and the Philippines
taken care of, but the people of Alaska come home to
us. They are of our own flesh and blood. They go
there from every State and Territory in the Union.
Do not force them to protect themselves as best they
can from the strong arm of'mob law. The Senate
should pass the bill providing for their government."
There can be no question of the soundness of the
statement that the Alaskan people should be pro
vided with a government strong enough to save them
from having to resort to the rude law of mining
camps, but it is doubtful if the code bill will wholly
satisfy the adventurous element that has recently en
tered the gold districts. Like all Americans, they
have high political ambitions, with a strong desire for
local self-government and representation in Con
gress.
There have been several schemes put forward in the
way of providing a better government for the Terri
tory. One of these is for the establishment of a Terri
torial form of government similar to that in other
Territories of the Union. Another proposes the ad
mission of Alaska as a State. A third advocates the
division of the Territory into two parts, one to
bear the name "Alaska" and the other to be called
"Seward," in honor of the statesman whose diplo
macy added the territory to our possessions. .
In 1884 there was established in Alaska a district
government, with a: Governor and a .district court.
Recently a new military department of Alaska was
created, and it was stated at the time that this fore
shadowed the. establishment of military rule in Alaska
temporarily ' for the purpose of forming a precedent
for such government in other remote possessions;
should it be deemed expedient to resort to it. Military
government will be of advantage until something of
order has been brought out of the situation, but then
the other projects will have to be discussed and acted
upon.
Alaska is large enough not for two only but for
half a dozen States, and therefore the suggested divi
sion will find many supporters. It is probable that
one section of it may so rapidly advance in, popula-'
tion, industry and wealth as to deserve a Territorial
if not a State government, while the remainder con
tinues unfitted for anything betty than the govern
ment which now prevails. If that be so, a division of
the territory is quite likely to occur, and it may, not
be long before the question of the admission of
Alaska as a State will.b e an issue, of practical politics.
shot that was addressed to in by the en
emy, until â until z-z-s-00-woof ! went a
shell into the R. A. limber, and two horses
fell,- one minus a Jaw and the other with
its stomach torn out.
Somebody began the remark that "That
Johnny had got the range,'-' when z-z-oo
woof! came a shell straight under the first
of the naval guns. Every man around it
stood* his ground, and death licked - his
lean chops as he reached a bony hand to
ward them, butâ the shell did not explode.
"No. 1 gun" was quickly hauled back a
hundred yards, and the while it was mov
ing a shell < chased It up and exploded
thirty yards behind It.
"I get no pay for this." said the hand
somer and younger of the correspondents.
"Let us go over and see what the heavy
rifle firing Is about on the far right."
An hour later each sat upon his sep
arate anthill on the extreme right of the
battlefield, where an endless, awful vol
leying of rifle fire had sounded ever since
daybreakâ for hour upon hour. The cor
respondents were 2500 yards behind the
firing line of the British, who lay in rows
upon their bellies firing at unseen Boers
In an invisible trench, which spat out bul
lets as a needle-bath sprays water.
I fancy the younger correspondent was
congratulating himself- upon his safety,
but as he did so there came a sound like
heavy hall upon a tin roof, and bullets
whistled, pinged and spatted all around
him. The sound came from behind his
back. The Boers had â¢ made a flank
movement, dashing furiously toward the
ambulance and transport wagons, bang
ing at them with a volley and setting all
the drivers and horses in a panic In the
same panic, the two correspondents ran
straight into the danger zone of the main
battle.
They fell when they found the air as
thick with bullets as ever a pudding was
with plums, and when, wherever they put
down, a foot, there was a spurt of sand
from a falling shot.
"There was no other way to run, they
said to one another. "It looked as if the
Boers would cut us off in the other direc
"Putt-putt-putt-putt," sounded the aw
ful Vickers-Maxim quick-firer, and Its
tornado of one-pound shells raked the air
over their heads with seven screaming
missiles at a time. Zizz-zit! hummed the
Mauser, and the Martini-Henry bullets,
like magnified bees in Â»warms. The air
was thick with flying lead. Bits of the
friendly anthill were clipped off. Spray
from the dust Jets thrown up by bullets
fell softly on the hands of the . corre
spondents. Thicker and thicker came the
hall, for the Boer sharpshooters had seen
the two men run' and drop and were
sending a cross-fire where they lay. They
buried their noses in the red sand and
talked and thought. _
They talked and thoughtâ about what?
"I wonder what's become of our
horses?" Â¦ - _
"Hello! Here's the guards doctor. Doc
tor, how can that mule stand there 100
yards ahead of us where the bullets are
like raindrops in a slanting rain? I'll bet

it. Perhaps we are, too."

HURT BY OUR OWN FOLLY.
r~* EVERAL times since the outbreak of the war
in South Africa we have had occasion to note
* â ' evidences of the loss suffered at our Atlantic
ports by reason of the decreased facilities for ship
ping caused by the withdrawal of so many British
vessels from that trade for use in the war. Not long
ago we noted the complaints made of delay in trans-
Atlantic mails, from that cause, and now there come
still more serious complaints of a lack of facilities for
handling the freights of. the country.
The Boston Herald, in commenting upon the situa
tion as viewed from that port, says: "The pressure
for freight space on the steamers that are left behind
has been so great as to materially raise ' the price
charged for transportation, and thus both reduction
in accommodations and increased cost -of transports -;
tion have stood in the way of the progressive develop
ment of our export trade. -Whether merchandise
shall be sent out of this country for sale is determined
to quite an extent by the price demanded for trans
porting it thither, and when this price is exception
ally high it must in many cases trench so far upon
possible profits as to make such shipments an unat
tractive venture. By having this barrier^ raised
around our frontier our-trade must suffer to some
extent, just how much can be better determined when
the.reports of a term of- six months or: so of these
new. conditions have been compiled."
It needs no elaborate argument to show that what-:
ever checks or diminishes our. export trade injures the
whole : nation. Â¦ Farmers and manufacturers, whose
products are 1 largelydependent upon foreign markets
for, profitable sale, are directly affected by a decrease
in transportation facilities, accompanied by an Y in
crease in rates, and through them other classes of
citizens are indirectly affected. Consequently we are
now compelled to suffer a considerable diminution of
prosperity because the British are at war with 'the
Transvaal.
It will not do to shift the blame for that loss upon
either the British or the Boers. Neither of those peo-

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
RELYING upon the Scientific American and
certain statements in Rev. Mr. Sheldon's re
ligious daily newspaper, The Call said yester
day that if the people of Glasgow were by public
ownership relieved of all public taxation other than
the price paid for. water, light and riding on the
street cars, oar people will not be contented until
they know whj' they cannot enjoy an equal immunity
from public .burdens. Within a few days Senator
Jones of Arkansas, who is a man of leisure and
spends his vacations in Europe, has said that the peo
ple of European cities, relieved of public burdens by
municipal ownership of public utilities, laugh at us
for plodding along under the same old yoke.
We have now examined the question of fact in
volved, and find that not Glasgow, nor any European
city that we can discover, has been able to shift pub
lic taxation upon the income from public utilities.
The municipal reports of the city of Glasgow show
that the people of that municipality are taxed in the
ordinary way, on an income basis, on the annual
rental value of property. The levy in Glasgow for
1898-99 for general municipal purposes, schools, poor
mte. etc., on Â£10 rentals, was 3s 3d 9-16 per pound,
or l6l_ per cent on the rental value; the owner of
the property pays also is yd 7-16 per pound rental,
equal to SVÂ£ per cent. The owner who occupies his
own premises pays both taxes, equal to 25 per cent
on the annual rental value. Added to fhis the general
government, through its inland revenue department,
collects a tax on land and an inhabited house tax.
ihe two amounting to 4 per cent of the rental value.
Every person having an income of Â£300 per annum,
from whatever source derived, pays another tax of Sd
per pound, or 3 1-3 per cent on his income.
This is pretty stiff taxation, beside which San Fran
cisco's favorite "dollar limit" seems light as air. Our
dollar limit, however, is not levied on annual income,
but on estimated cash value of property, and our per
sonal property is taxed separately from realty. In
Glasgow the tax on annual rental value and the in
land revenue taxes are in lieu of all other forms of
tax. We estimate the Glasgow tax to be about $14.50
per $1000 of cash value of the property, which as
sumes the rental or income value to be 5 per cent per
annum. The difference between the Scotch town and
American cities of similar situation and population is
not great, with perhaps the average advantage in
favor of the American cities.
We don't know how the idea became fixed in this'
country that Glasgow is free from municipal and pub
lic taxation as the result of owning public utilities.
That such idea'has no foundation in fact admonishes
to a cautious examination of all statements made on
thr side of public ownership. Each case is individual

situation or structure of government, that cannot be

looking at him. They seemed to follow
him as he turned away, sick at stomach

was like the sound of frying fat.
The bullets sang all around him, like

he fell * flat on his face and said ' to him

were with the naval men in their broad
rimmed straw hats covered with khaki
with their loose, crouching attitudes and
movementâ so different from soldiers,

ference. When they saw anything at

ute or two, but between whiles they
lounged about like a picnic party. '
It was I one-sided warfare . till the rank
and hairy Boers got one of their batteries
into position behind a ridge a mile and a
half away. Then It . became two-sided,
like a game of pitch and toss, in which it
seemed that every time we sent them a
shell they sent it back. A Royal Artillery
battery rumbled up and unlimbered near
us,- sending Its limber of horses a little
way back and opening heavy fire on the
unclean foe.
Opening heavy fireâ and meeting heavy
fire. Z-z-z-o-00-woof ! came the shells,
ripping the air. gashing the ground and
throwing up . fountains of red earth and
broken iron. The correspondents and one
or two officers, who appeared to have no
part in the work of . the battery, stood
near a railway culvert of solid masonry
and strolled into its shelter every time
they saw the flash and smoke of a Boer
gun. .It may not have been very brave,

BRYAN THE PROPHET.
COLONEL BRYAN is again in the midst of us,
displaying his opportunism in politics, search
ing for the microbe of discontent, and breeding
it in the culture bed of his. facile speech. His place
in national politics very much resembles that of the
San Francisco Board of bad Health. He pretends
to discover social and financial epidemics, which he
only can eradicate. He is the cholagogue required to
purge the public system of the ills which he diagnoses
with such offhand freedom.
It is quite amazing .'hat he 'is able to put an entirely
new lot of prophecies on the market to 4 succeed M 3
catalogue of 1896, and find people who are willing
even to pretend to have faith in his prevision.
In his book, "The First Battle," published after the
campaign of 1596, appear many of his speeches of
that year. In one of these he shut his eyes and
opened his mouth and raised his voice to the
prophetic altitude, and said: "The gold standard
means dearer money; dearer money means cheaper
property; cheaper property means harder times;
harder times means more people out of work; more
people out of work means more people destitute;
more people destitute means more people desperate;
more desperate people means more crime."
The gold standard has been maintained ever since
1896. ever since this house-that-Jack-built prophecy
was uttered. It has in that time been definitely fixed
by affirmative legislation. Every dollar of currency
in the country has been by express law made re
deemable in the gold standard, and its value is par
with gold. The condition which Mr. Bryan talked
about has been upon us ever since, but not one re
sult that he prophesied has come to pass. Property
has a rising and more stable value; times have
grown better every hour since his defeat four years
ago; more people are employed than ever before in
the history of the country; fewer people are destitute;
fewer people are desperate, and crime is on the de
crease, notwithstanding the demoralization of war.
The only serious public disturbance is in Ken
tucky, caused by Colonel Bryan's partisans attempt
ing to reverse a Republican majority of 40,000 by
force and fraud.
Every manufacturing center is a humming hive of
industry. Instead of making money dear the gold
standard has made it so cheap that the Government
can refund all of its outstanding bonded debt at 2
per cent, and the new bonds, at that lowest rate ever
touched by a public security in the world, command
a premium of 7 per cent.
Colonel Bryan is out again prophesying. Let him
face the failure of all his predictions made four years
ago. He spoke two hours and a half at Sacramento
this week, and when he descends from the north in a
few days will talk a streak through California. He is
marketing a new lot of predictions. What guarantee
can he give that they are any better than the old lot
which failed?
. ' He and his partisans fail to see that he is fallen to
the plane of a mere agitator. He seizes upon the
burning issue of the hour, whatever it may.be, treats
it empirically, appeals to that side of it on which he
thinks there is the most prejudice, appeals to the
heavens, the earth and the waters underneath the
earth, and tells what will happen, direful, dangerous,
dark and dreadful, if he is not elected President. Be
tween him and Debs and General Weaver and old
Solon Chase and his steers there is not the slightest
difference in methods, ideas or capacity. That he is
able to retain the leadership of the Democratic party
is merely evidence of the decadence of that organi
zation. Debs or Weaver would do as well as he.
Parties may be composed of politicians, but they
must ibe led by statesmen. Statesmen adopt certain
fixed principles and adhere to them. They have a
correct idea of results that will follow the success or
the failure of those principles in government. They
do not go out guessing at results to catch votes, a3
Mr. Bryan does.
No man ever appeared in our public life as full of
warnings, of forecasts, of predictions, as he. His every
utterance in 1896 was of that character, and not one
has been justified by events. Not one of them is
even dormant still and likely to sprout in fulfillment,
for they have all been specifically negatived. Now it
is not in the nature of things that a public man
whose views have all failed, have all been negatived,
have all been shown worthless and imsound, should
be trusted when he appears so soon with a new set
of views, which he presents with equal confidence and
backs up with the same pretense of insight and parade
of prophetic gift.
pies is bound by any; form of obligation to furnish
shipping for our exports.' - If we' have goods we wish
transported to foreign markets we should provide yes-:
sels to carry them. In the loss we are now sustain
ing, therefore, we have no right to blame anything
except -the folly of our own Government, which for
so long a time has excluded, the shipping industry
from the scope of its protection.
In a recent address on the condition of thecountry
Senator : Frye said : ; . "Last year, with" all our-enor
mous imports and exports to and from Europe, our
ships did not carry quite 2, per cent, and in all the
world they did not carry quite 9 per cent. The Prod
uce Exchange a few 'years ago made a' report that
1750 ships in that* year, cleared from New York for
foreign markets loaded with our products, and seven
of them carried the American flag."
Consider .the complaints; of , a lack of shipping, fa
cilities because of the South African war in the light
of the statements of Senator Frye. arrd it will be seen
at once where the responsibility for the loss lies: We
have*neglected our own interests and been content
to depend upon the British, and now we see the in
evitable consequence. It is. to be remembered, more
over, that Great Britain is at war with a very small
power. What would have been the loss upon the
transportation of our exports this season if she had
entered upon war with a great power? If Congress
be wise it will learn the lesson taught in this case
and not postpone the enactment of a liberal merchant
marine bill until a heavier loss and a more disastrous
lesson teach us wisdom.

While the'nobles had some shadow or

GOLDEN AGES OF LITERATURE^
XH, DANTEAND HIS RELATION
TO MODERN LITERATURE.
BY C. W. BENTON, PH.D.
: The philosopher Giobertl ' has : compared
Dante to the acoatha tree in India, which,
by Â¦ throwing out ; from Its branches new
shoots into the ground, becomes of Itself
a forest. "The middle ages,", says Lowell,
"were reflected in his soul as the universe
in a drop of dew."
As the materials of different geologic
ages entered into the composition of his
favorite church of San Giovanni, the gates
of which Michael Angelo declared were
worthy to be the gates of paradise, so the
."Divine Comedy" embraced earth and
heavenâ a cul a porto mano c clelo c terra.
Italy had been the center of the cru
sades. Her Popes had given the order to
march. Her ships had furnished the
means of transport. The enthusiasm ot
that conflict -of centuries hnd not fallen
with the heroic figure of St. Louis, but
was turned in other directionsâ to the
building of cathedrals and great systems
of thought..- Armies as well ' as . ldeas . had
crossed the national boundaries. The con
flict between Gregory VII and Henry IV
of Germany was still shaking the Conti
nent, a distant echo of which was recent
ly heard in- the Â¦ remark Â¦of a German
Prince that there was no more going to
Canossa. â¢ . Â¦ , - _

OMAHA, March 27.â The outrage per
petrated Â¦ upon Mr. and Mrs: "Louis Figg
by. a â¢ frenzied mob :.Â¦ at Â¦ Gretna': Friday,
night la : the ;'second Instance .wherein j a
woman has received a coat ' of tar and
feathers in Nebraska in recent years. ;Â¦ In
the last instance the deed ' was far \ from
Justified; in the former 'case : at Osceola
no sympathy; was wasted upon the scar
let woman who was' made black by. a
party of prudish women prominent in so
cial circles. "~
It was a comparatively light coat which
the Gretnaltes spread. upon Mr. 'and Mrs.
Figg, for both were able to be about ! the
next ; day." In fact, Mr. Fire hurried to
the county seat, where , he filed Informa
tions before* the County Attorney and the
Sheriff went to Gretna to serve the war
rants, which called for three well-known
men, said to have been - the leaders â¢of
the mob which Invaded \ the sanctity of
the Figg ' home, .dragged Mr. Figg and
wife out of bed and noiselessly but quick
ly doped them with tar and feathers. It
was plainly the intention of the men to
warn but not , to injure their victims.
Should the warning not be heeded the
outrage may be repeated in true Westerfl
style, .
The Figgite sect has . caused a great
deal of public scandal in the little village
only a few miles south of Omaha. It was
founded four ' or five years ago. To de
scribe its adherents as fanatics is not
overstepping tha bounds of truth. Mr.
and Mrs. Flgg are the acknowledged
leaders and they have gradually won over
quite a number of well-meaning persons,
mostly women, to their, beliefs. Tbey be
lieve that every I unsanctifled person â¢ pos
sesses a personal devil or is the personi
fication of satan. They claim to have the
power to discover in sinners the existence
of a devil and upon making such Â¦ dis
covery they hold, it to be their duty â¢to
chastise the body holding it until the
evil spirit shall be driven out." Three
years ago several husky citizens of Gret
na objected to having! the devil driven
out of them in this manner Â¦ and after
certain enthusiastic Figgltes had gone to
the hospital they began doubting the ef
ficacy of their methods and quit the chas
tisement feature. *
But it was in the power of a Figgite
to discover the devil while he was yet in
visible to the unsaved. So a delegation
of them went' to one of the Gretna
churches and during the middle of the
service suddenly saw the devil standing
out on the edge Â¦of the platform just in
front of the preacher. Three or four
women -at once began screaming and
made a dash for the devil, who sought
safety up one aisle and down another till
he finally escaped from - the church and
across a corn field, where the women
soon became exhausted from running over
the soft ground. Regular, members of
the church, who didn't see the devil at
all, were much incensed.
These remarkable demonstrations by
the Figgltes.. continued at succeeding
church services and. camp meetings in
Sarpy County, until finally the Figgites
; came over into" Douglas County and dis
covered the devil at one of the meetings.
The preacher, . however, preferred the
devil to the Figgltes, and had the women
arrested for disturbing a religious meet
ing. At a trial Justice Cockerell
In Omaha each woman in turn entered
the plea "Guilty .in the eyes of man, but
Innocent in the sight of God," while
shrieks of "Glory to God" and . "Hallelu
jah" made the courtroom ring. The Jus
tice, ' however, viewed the situation with
the eyes of man, and heavily fined the
women, each of whom refused to pay, and
served out her term in jail, living mar
tyrs to the undying faith within them.
Fanatical Demonstrations.
Rev. Charles W.Savidge.i pastor of the
People's Church, Omaha, tells of an epi
sode in which the Figgites figured.
"I first knew the Flggs in 1884," said
Rev. Mr: Savidge, "and at that time they
were recent converts to religion. They
started out on the right .track and were
highly regarded. That was at Spring
field, Sarpy County. The next I- heard
of them was three years ago when I went
to Gretna to hold a meeting. I noticed
that my ; audience was inclined to watch
the church doors throughout the service.
I asked. the reason why. The reply was:
The Figgites are likely. to come at any
time and break up the , meeting." 'Who
are ; the Figgltes ?' I asked. On being in
formed I announced that . I would go to
see them. ' I called at their home the next
morning. Mr. Figg was not at home, but
Mrs. Flgg admitted 1 me. â¢ We talked
pleasantly for < a while,- but : when a dif
ference of â¢ opinion was expressed she be
gan -to scream ; at the top of her 'voice
she ; shouted : 'You've got . the devil In
you.' She carried : a young babe in ' her
arms, and as she danced about the room,
in what I would call a fanatical can-can,
It was to me a most shocking sight. ,1 ex
cused 5 myself, . saying I would â¢ call again
when I could see her husband. -
"A few nights later the Figgs came to
my meeting. I saw at once that I had to
deal with combustible material. | foe they
were - tinctured with .wildfire. There was
no violent demonstration. ; however, ; until
just before the close of the service, when
Mrs. Figg . went into a hysterical fit of
screaming and reiterated her charge that
I had the devil in me. y. I acted as calmly
as " I 'could â¢ and announced to her that
while she had broken up the meeting that
time, she must never do it again. I told
her I expected to have her arrested, which
I did, after consulting legal authority.
"That ended my experience with the
Figgs for the time, but a year later I was
at Gretna and \ somebody broke my.: car
riage to pieces. . It was the general opin
ion of my friends that the followers of
the Figgites were responsible for the van
dalism. The carriage was cut loose from
: the horses and broken up one night
W"lW "l fbelleve the people lof Oretna had
sufficient provocation to cause .them jto
take extreme measures against the Flggs.
IÂ¦ do not i say that I ! Indorse the tar .and
feather plan, but I do say that something
ought to be done to rid the State of such
people. m They,,, have^ been a menace to

"I propose to stay in Gretna and will not

I have done in i the *< past. â¢ Threats Lwill

to lynchme for adhering to my religious
convictions, all .well and good. '
was In this alone that thÂ© common people
could be fed the bread of life. The "Di
vine Comedy'" contains a record of all
that concerned Europe In the middle ages,
a complete system of what was thought
and felt on politics, on art. on astronomy,
on religion. These elements which each
existed separately would probably hayÂ»
disappeared, certainly would* have been
outgrown or. supplanted, were they not
combined through the mysterious prin
ciple of life by the personality of the poet.
It was this faculty of harmonizing what
were opposing tendencies of civilization,
the power of expressing the thought of
all time in the language of to-day and
in faultless form that make an era In
literature, for Dante first showed In an
eminent degree that . openness of mind
which appreciates and appropriates the
good wherever it is found, ana which al
ways must remain the mark of the high
est culture. It Is this universality which
characterizes the work of Dante which
has given so many theories as to the con
tents of. the "Divine Comedy.". â¢-\ -' ?
It Is a -textbook on astronomy and
medieval science. . All these and other
theories have been given, and all are true.
It depends on the side from which tha
work Is approached. Like the Bible, every
one found in it what he wished to find.
Some read It because it placed their ene
mies in hell; others with the hope of find
ing their friends in- heaven: others be
cause they find there the thought and
feeling of many centuries, compressed,
like the gifts to humanity in Pandora's
box. Into the compass of one "mystic, un
fathomable song. Xo danger that the
spirits of the deep or the odors of the
celestial plains : shall ever evaporate, for
they are held secure as by plates of triple
steel. Each perfect in Itself, they follow
each other, like the waves of the sea.
those shafts of glowing rhyme revealing
the wonders of the deep until the travel
ers have reached the further shore. And
when they ascend the laborious mount, and
later. In company with a heavenly guide,
the poet continues his flight through cir>
clea of Infinite space, there is no touch of
weariness until the great song is done and
ends with the word stelleâ the stars.
"The central man of all the world."
says Ruskin, "as representins In perfect i
balance the Imaginative moral and Intel
lectual faculties all at their highest."* MgS
We receive from Dante the same im
pression of universal Intellect as from
Shakespeare. . with this . difference: â¢ that
while Shakespeare conceals his own per
sonality behind a moving multitude ,as
broad as humanity. Dante himself is al
ways ' present with his undying love as
"transcendent as his scorn."
"A little philosophy." said Bacon. Heads
away from religion, but much philosophy
brings - back to â¢ religion." Salnte : Beuve
has similarly remarked: "There is a cer
tain degree of poetry. which carries away
from reality, and there is a Â« greater
amount of poetry which brings back to
it,- which embraces all history." Such is
'he poetry, of .Dante. From him poetry
i the very. soul and". utterance of truth,
his is the character of; Hebrew poetry;
he prophets and the psalmists and th"
, Ã¼blime author of the book of Job did
lot write history as such. They had an- â¢
other motive." But this view was so vast
.and so deep that it Includes all history tn
one ' lasting lesson for all the centuries.*
And so in Dante are contained In germ
air the forms of modern literature. : He
lias Inspired the artists and the thinkers
of the modern world. The dramatics the
realistic, the- romantic, the psychological
school of art are all there. As he Is the
father^ of - the â¢ romantic school by thÂ«
power of his imagination and the abund
ance : and intensity : of . his personal feel-
Ing, yet as he always subordinates fancy,
to Â¦ reason."' he : has . reached that - simplic
ity, and Â¦ perfection of . form which is the
mark of the classic genius. -Both of these
tendencies which have divided all litera
ture and; art uniteiln.him.- This? ls t why
his book is. of interest to all classes of
menâ the historian, the artist, the dramat- 1
Ist.", the philosopher. , His statue holds the

MISS DARCHY SPOKE
OF THE ANTIPODES
Described Australian Peculiarities
and Told How Washington Could
Have Lost â¢ Reputation.
Mlss'Darchy of the Sydney Daily Tele
graph staff delivered. the first of two lec
tures on' Australia in Golden Gate Hall
last evening. She has a melodious voice
and a pleasing stage presence, and these
qualities lent interest to her treatment of
the subject. Her theme was ."Australia
Civilized." She began with an account of
the old convict days, then came to bush
ranging, then passed to the time when the
wilderness was subdued. Finally she de
scrjbed Melbourne "the marvelous." and
picturesque Sydney." In describing the
physical characteristics, of the land she
dwelt on the great plains, which after the
rains are covered with grass that grows
higher than the head of a mounted horse
man, and in Â¦ the dry season are barren,
parched and cracked. In a time of great
drought as many as a million sheep were
ascertained to have perished from hunger
and thirst. The Australian, she said, was
not a provident man. . The country pro
duced so plentifully that there was no in
centive to economy. The land was large
and the population small. Manufacturing
was backward, but would largely increase
in the next decade. She described the
pests of goats and rabbits. George Wash
ington, in her opinion, if he had tried. to
supply the people with statistics .about
the Australian rabbits, would < not have
been able to set up as the father of his
country because he would have forfeited
his reputation for truth. Rather would
he have been thought fit for a mining ex
pert or real estate boomer. The . lecture
was interesting and Instructive. Â¦ "

RECOMMEND RAISE IN
ELECTRIC LIGHT RATES
Supervisors' Committee Regards the
Sum of Eleven Cents Per Lamp
as Too Low.
The Supervisors' Committee on. Artifi
cial Lights yesterday decided to . recom
mend that the maximum rates* to be
charged on electric' lamps be raised j from
11 cents to 13 cents.: This decision was ar
rived at after Attorney, Bishop of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company, W.
G. Summerhayes of the Mutual Company
and Expert A. M. Hunt of the Independent
Light and Power â¢ Company had : been
heard on the subject .There were present
Supervisors Hotallng, : Dwyer and * Bran
densteln of the committee, Supervisors
Jennings, Tobln, Helms, Connor and Box
ton and City Engineer Grunsky, who were
present by invitation. . ... , . ,
Attorney Bishop represented that the 11
cent rate for each electric : lamp in . the
district west of Larkln street and south
west of Tenth street was too low, as it cost
9 8-10 cents to distribute the current The
rate had been reduced from 20 cents, and
he made an urgent plea for a 15-cent rate
because of great loss owing to the iso
lated service in the outside district . â¢ :
Expert Hunt opposed the proposition on
the ground that the rate established was
fair and equitable. â¢ ?
"I will grant," said Mr. Hunt, "that it
costs' 9 8-10 cents to supply each lamp with
the electric current, but that could be re
duced were the San Francisco Company
to. Install adequate transformers in their
Bystem. The plant is inefficient on its al
ternating current plan., and the loss in
electricity is due to antiquated trans
formers. It is not right. that the people of
San Francisco should be saddled with the
blunders and losses of the company."
- Mr. Summerhayes said that Â¦it was ' not
fair for the company to charge inhlbitlve
prices, and contended that the 11-cent rate
was sufficient for residences in any part
of the city.
Chief Engineer Grunsky was of the
opinion that theprofitin the downtown dis
tricts might compensate for the loss in
outside localities, > and â¢; he asserted that
the stated cause of the increased cost in
the latter portions of the city, was not
definite. ' '. â¢ ' Â¦ " -.'.;â¢
The committee went Into executive ses
sion and at its conclusion announced that
It was convinced. of the merits of the pe
tition for an. increased raje and had de
cided to recommend that it be raised to
13 cents per lamp throughout the city. It
was deemed Inadvisable to set a rat* of
11 cents for downtown and 15 cents for the
residence district, so the compromise rate
was agreed upon. The minimum rate to
be - charged for electric service was fixed
at JI 50 per month, a reduction of 50 cents
on the old rate.

Greek literature and art. His ideals were
realized in the beautiful forma of Phidias

and the Ideas of -Plato. Then came the
third period, which ends with Aristotle
and the -search for the true. Greece had
accomplished her work and the torch
passed on to other bands. - ,
â The same three i periods appear in
Italy. From the sublime in Dante art
passes on to the beautiful in Petrarch and
Raphael, when the whole noonday glory
of the- Italian renaissance burst * upon
Europe and kindled the flame of devotion
to art and letters which, beginning with
Italy, surrounded the world. Then came
the third period, with the search for new
worlds by Galileo and Columbus.
It was In the "Divine Comedy" that all

combine in one living and perfect whole.

In an artistic form that no one thought of
using. He takes the common dialect
spoken by the women and children of
Italy," thought unworthy for a/iy serious
work, and in it he treats the great
themes of science and philosophy hitherto
confined to Latin and the, quiet of the
cloister. There was the fine wheat of ths
Latin, he said, but there was also the
barley bread of the vulgar dialect, and it

A r ezu York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 27.â The etock market
continued very active and varied, to-day, but
there was an appreciable check to the up
ward movement cf prices and a distinct falling
off in the volume of the demand. The dispo
sition to realize made Itself felt In additional
ttocks and as a consequence the market be
came dull and the weight of profit-taking
proved too much for many stocks which have
been most prominent in the recent upward
movement, conspicuously so in the Southern
group of trunk lines. Including Pennsylvania,
Norfolk and Ww<tern and Baltimore and Ohio.
The stocks of the latter company fluctuated
widely all day and were under very palpable
manipulation. The common and the preferred
rtocke were aÂ«ain brought to a parity In the
late dealings. The purpose of the maneuver
was evident from the suggestion set afloat that
If Baltimore and Ohio common without pay-
Ing a dividend could crocs the preferred stock
other common stocks In the fame situation
might do likem-ise. The Pacific stocks had to
absorb a large amount of realizing and the
6outhern and Southwestern frroups were af
fected by the same cause. The bituminous
coal road ctockc also came to a halt. Other
points of strength developed In the list and
the net change* show a large proportion of
fralns. The general tone of the market, how.
Â»v*r. was by no means so strong as yesterday
and the transactions were on a smaller scale.
The coalers, tbe high-priced Industrials, the
iron and steel stock* and local tractions all
ehowed evidence of etrenÃth and there were
come conspicuous advances In stocks. It
would be difficult to assign a cause In any
news of the day for the check to the advance.
but speculative sentiment accorded more action
to unfavorable possibilities even of a contingent
nature. Thus pome quextlon was allowed to
rise of the future of the money â¢ market, al
though the present tendency Is all toward
greater ease, rates for call loans dropping to
2 per cent lat* in the day. The banks are
(raining cash on sub-treasury operations and
the interior continues to remit to New Tork
la payment of loans Incurred for the purchase
cf Government bonds, but the completion of
payments of the premiums on Government
bonds offered for conversion will result In re
newed drains to the sub-treaÃury so long as
the Government's revenues continue Â«o largely
in eicets of expenditures. A suggestion of
another drain on resources for Government ac
count Is contained In the sailing for Manila
to-day of the transport Sumner, taking out
J1.3u0.000 for the paymaster's department In the
Philippines. London's operations in buying
ptorks are due to money loaned In this market,
which explains the flrmnens of the sterling ex
change In face 'of Lnndon buying and In face
cf the London speculative movement. London
took profits on a large scale to-day and Its
celling of stocks about equaled its buying. A
number of strong returns of net earnings for
February was disregarded In the trading.
The bond market was not so active as yes
terday, but a larjre business was done at ad
vancing prices. Total sales, par value, $4,
555.000.
United Etates registered advanced % and
coupon and new 4s U In the bid price. The
old 4s declined % and the Ss % per cent.

London Market.
NEW YORK, March 27.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram _ says:
Americans were again the main feature In the
market here to-day, although the volume of
business was smaller than yesterday. TheJ
opened strong, well above parity, Paris and
Berlin -also buying. .This movement was met
by heavy .realizing and prices reacted, but
rallied somewhat and remained dull until 3
o'clock, when New. York opened with a spotty
tendency, selling most- things and later every
thing. In , the house prices closed weak, but
there was some rally In the street, most securi
ties showing gains on balances. Southern Pa
cific was a London : favorite,. ln .the morning.
Rates were stiff, 5%Q 6, but takers of Balti
more, and Ohio, were, pretty: numerous. Con
sols and the war loan were weak, the tendency
In money being to harden, . though t loan Â¦ and
discount rates .were unchanged and there were
pome signs of an -early break. The Bank of
England did a considerable j fresh business In
discounts. Silver was Â¦ firm, the East buying.
The Bank of England bought Â£11,000 gold In
bars and got Â£19,000 from Holland. ,

CHICAGO, March 27. â The volume of busi
ness transacted in the â¢ wheat pit was hot
large, being mostly of a scalping nature. The
cash business was slack, only SO, 000 bushels
being reported sold here last night for export.
The market acted somewhat like an oversold
one, as It took but little to 'send shorts to
cover. May opened a shade down at 65H@65%c,
Influenced by lower cables, and shortly after
ward touched 65% c. The moderate receipts
caused covering at the decline and May rallied
to 65% c, but on profit-taking eased off to 65% c.
The decrease In the world's visible came as a
further support and May again advanced to
C6c. At the top there was more profit-taking,'
but the lofs was slight, the market closing
firm, with May He up at 65% c.
With Liverpool %G%& higher at the close
the local corn market persisted In going down,
closing easy. Country acceptances were small.
Trade 'was less active than yesterday. Longs
let out a few lines which materially assisted
In the depressing of the price. May closed
%c down.
Oats were ' firm without being very ' active.
There was a fair demand for domestic ship
ment and the export demand was somewhat
Improved In order to work cargoes before the
export rate advances on April 2. May closed
%c up. . . ' Â¦
The provision market was active and strong,
opening higher In sympathy with stlffer prices
at the yards and advancing on a good de
mand. Packers were the best buyers of lard
and ribs, while the demand for pork seemed j
to be quite general. May pork closed 10c over
yesterday. May lard 2%c Improved and May
ribs 2%ff?sc better. . .

THE DIVORCE D COURT
OAKLAND, March 27.â AJonzo W. Fink,
a prominent commission merchant of San
Francisco, was put on his defense' to-day,
before Judge Hall at the trial of Mrs. May
E. Fink's suit for a divorce. * -. .
Upon request of both sides the case was
tried . behind closed doors, although , the
accusations are only embraced under the
general head of extreme - cruelty. Mrs.
Fink i related : her story of domestic i infe
licities - this afternoon/ citing /many? In
stances of â¢ abuse, physical - and ; vocal, to
which she alleges she had been subjected.
The couple have resided in Alameda for
many \ years, .s. Fink < denies -Â¦, his wife's
charges, and each , side has : opened a vig
orous contest, : Mrs.- Fink's counsel j being
H. . C. â¢'. McPike and R. E. â¢ Ragland , while
her husband is represented by, George W.
Bankrupt Merchant.
James G. Gorevan Jr., merchant, Ban
Francisco; liabilities, S4ISB 16; no assets.
DEEP SEA PRESSURE.
The temperature at the . bottom of the
ocean is nearly down to freezing point,
and sometimes actually below It. There
is a total absence of light, as far as sun
light Is concerned, and there Is an enorm
ous pressure, reckoned at. about a ton to
the sauare inch In > every 1000 fathoms,
which Is * 180 times greater than that of
the atmosphere in which we live. At 2500
fathoms the pressure Is thirty, times more
powerful than the steam pressure of a lo
comotive when drawing a train. â¢
As : late as 1880 a leading â¢ zoologist ex
plained'the existence of deep-sea animals
at â¢'Â¦ such"; depths - by : assuming that their
bodies were composed of solids and liquids
of great | density,^ and â¢ contained "no air.
This, however, is not. the case with deep
sea flsh.' which â¢ are provided with air-in
flated swimming bladders.
If one of these fish," In full chase after
Its prey.'s happened to ascend '_ beyond - a
certain level Its bladder becomes distended
with the decreased pressure and carries it.
In * spite of ; Its efforts, still higher In its
course ; In c fact, > members of ; this unfor
tunate class are likely to become victims
to the unusual accident of falling upward,
and Â¦no doubt' meet. with a violent death
soon after leaving their accustomed level,
and long before their bodies reach the sur
face * in ; a distorted ' and ? unnatural Â¦ state."
Even ground ' sharks, brought up from I a
depth Â¦ of -i no â¢ more t than 1 605* fathoms, ex
pire before they sain the surface.
POSTTJM CERE AT-
Agreement by Telephone Valid.
The Jury In the case of James A.; Mo
rrow against the Franklyn Fire Insurance
Company, in which the plaintiff sued to
recover on a : policy alleged to ; have , been
secured in the defendant company through
the medium of a " contract entered into
over the telephone wire, has given Judg
ment for the defendant. Although Judge
Paprs decided that an : agreement made
by means of the telephone was valid and
bo instructed the Jury, the fact that such
an agreement was made was not proved
to the ; satisfaction of . the Judges of the
facts and Judgment was entered accord
ingly. Â¦>Â¦-:_.Â¦- Â¦"-'
man toppled over backward, at the same
time throwing up his hands. His condi
tion was such that he could not save him
self, and the back of his head smashed
with a thud against the edge of one of the
concrete steps which lead into the saloon
from the street. Several bystanders as
sisted Conrad, as he was unable to rise,
and from a contusion on the scalp the
blood was observed to flow. He was taken
to the office of Dr. A. A. Stafford, in the
neighborhood, who said the skull had been
fractured but that the wound was not a
serious one. Conrad was in a stupor,
but it was thought that his condition was
due to liquor. â¢ Later Conrad was removed
to the homo of his mother, 1013 Eagle ave
nue. Joseph and the witnesses to the af
fair went to their homes, unaware of the
fatal nature of the wounded man;s In
juries. At 1:30 o'clock this morning he
passed away.
"When I was told this morning that
Conrad was dead I couldn't believe it."
said Joseph in the City Prison to-day. "I
hadn't any idea that he was so badly hurt.
He was of a quarrelsome disposition and
always looking for trouble."
Conrad "has frequently figured In the
courts, and the police have listened to
many complaints. from housewives whom
he insulted. No pistol was, found In. the
clothing of the body when it was searched
by the. police, but- it is known that Con
rad was accustomed to carrying one. He
was a native of California and 84 years of
age.
Joseph bears a good reputation and is
foreman of the Sherman Hose Company.
His story of the affair ia corroborated by
a number of- witnesses, among them Mrs.
Josephine Reigelhuth. Richard and Her
bert Noy, Fred Castro and Cyrus Russell.
The Coroner held an inquest this even-
Ing. The Jury found that Conrad's death
was caused by fracture of the skull, but
whether accidentally or not the Jury
could not determine.
TEACHERS TRY TO

Concerning Changes in
the Programme.
Dr. Fredericks Presents a Paper on

1113 Broadway. March 27.
Tha course of 3tudy to be uaed In thÂ©
Alameda County public schools after July
1 was the subject of much discussion at
this morning's session of the Teachers'
Institute. The only definite action taken
by the teachers with relation to the sub
ject was to adopt a resolution that the
half-hour devoted to science be made nn
asslgned; so the teacher may use that pe
riod as deemed most necessary to the
class.
The efforts of the County Board of Edu
cation to arrange a better course of study
were acknowledged by the adoption of a
fitting resolution.
The following teachers were named as a
committee to present the views of the In
stitute to County Superintendent T. O.
Crawford: George EdgJir. William Green

Dr. Harold W. Fairbanks of the faculty
of the University of California gave a dis
course on methods of teaching geography,
the present system, he said, failing to
arouse the child's Interest. The collegian
added: "Geography Is being taught In tha
schools as bo much material to memorize,
and cannot be a success until It Is brought
before the child so that it shall mean
something to him. There Is a remedy for
this. In every Bection of the country there
are certain features of landscape differing
from that of every other section. If the
topography of the section is explained It
will appeal to the child and he will more
closely observe the small ravines, moun
tains, valleys, hills and rivers. Facts that
are related in no way to the dally life of
the child have no meaning to htm. He
should be made first to see understand
ingly the things that are near him,. and
then he will have sufficient Imagination to
grasp much about the things of which he
knows . nothing.
"The different mountain ranges and con
tinents and oceans will not then stand out
as Isolated facts, but will be drawn near
and will be appreciated by the child stu

FOOD RULES COMPLEXION.
Medicines of No Avail When Im-
proper Food Is Persisted In.
A voting lady whose first name is
Blo?Â«om, and who was for many year 3
misnamed, but is now properly named,
teth some interesting facts about her
efforts to clear up her complexion,
which in spite of all sorts of medicines
and washes, face bleaches, etc. etc., were
ineffective, because the root of the diffi-
culty was not removed.
Her own story is interesting: "From
childhood up, I, with my sisters and
brothers, have been allowed the use of
both tea and coffee. After I became a
young lady of course it was no more
than human that I should wish for a
beautiful complexion like several of my
companions, but which I did not have.
Many different courses were taken jo
accomplish my end. such as applying
face bleach, taking bottles and bottles of
cleansing medicines, etc., all to no pur-
pose.
"My older sister had learned before
me that coffee was the root of the diffi-
culty and urged me to begin taking hot
water. I tried it, but could find little
satisfaction in so weak and unpalatable
a beverage. While visiting a friend one
day I accepted a cup of coffee (as I
supposed), when I noticed that this par-
ticular coffee had a hundred per cent
better taste than the coffee we had been
in the habit of using. Upon inquiring
for the receipt of this very pleasant bev-
erage I learned that I had partaken of
the noted Po;tum Cereal Food Coffee.
"I had struck the goal at last. This
was the morning beverage that I want-
Â«d, and this, it turned out, was the se-
cret of the beautiful complexion of my
friend. Of course we immediately com-
menced using it in our ,. home, and I
want to say that to-day not a more
healthy, robust family is to be found in
the United States, and the fact is at-
tributable to our abandonment of coffee
and the use of Postum Cereal Food
Coffee." We do not feel to
publish the full name of Miss Blossom,
but the name can be given to those in-
terested by letter to the Postum Cereal
Co., Ltd.. Battle Creek, Mich. The
young lady lives in Traverse City, Mich.
It may be of interest to know that
many of the young ladies' seminaries
throughout the country have discon-
tinued the use of coffee and are using
Postum Food Coffee. A letter from
Rev. Alex. Burr. Secretary of the
Seattle (Wash.) Young Ladies' Semi-
nary, recites: "We are using Postum
Cereal pood Coffee on the table, greatly
to the satisfaction of the faculty and a
large number of boarding students."

AMERICAN HUMOR
MAKES THIS PLAY
. . COLLIER'S "Mr. Smooth"
1 I' | is a farce of manners. American
111 manners larded with American
humor. It is racy of the soil and
In Its up-to-the-moment way it is
very amusing.
It is brim full of keen colloquialism, and
although the structure of it is far from
firm, the incidents are articulated and
carry an interest equal to that of most
flippant farces. It is " the peculiarly
American cast of the dialogue that makes
"Mr. "Smooth" modestly important as a
vehicle of our typical humorâ humor that
can be understood in no country but this.
The play would be considered dull in
London and tame in Paris, for it has
neither the romping satire of the Gaiety
Theater productions, nor the risque levity
of the Palais Royal. If was written by
Willie Collier for Willie Collier and it fita
like the paper on the fence.
There have been other comedies and
other comedians that gave us that subtle
Inconsequent sort of wit that lies curled
up in some American brain like the hair
spring in a watch and is gradually gain
ing a specific classification in the King
dom of Humor, as the "American Josh,"
but where they have been cheap and vul
gar the present play and players are
quaint and clever.
Peter Daly portrayed an impossible per
son of the bunko brand, but Collier gives
us a flip character as Mr. Smooth, who,
in spite of his peccadillos, one would not
mind knowing. It is his touch that car
ries the play; it Is variously adroit and
there are innumerable little things in ges
ture, pose voice and expression that take
one's visible function by surprise.
Collier has the wisdom and good luck to
surround himself with an excellent com
pany, and the result is a performance as
smooth as the title of the play. Thomas
Evans "makes good", as Mr. Hlckey, a
bookmaker, and "hands out a line of
horse slang that is "all right" ,
Alfred Hickman wears very good
clothes and does it well. He also shows a
pleasing comedy Instinct, i which mod
crate and < genuine ? praise may be also
given to Mr. Ward, as Arthur Chlllelgh,
an elderly caricature, and to Mr. Her
kert and Mr. Sheehan, who carry out
Collier's quite original conceptions in the
parts of valet and butler. Louise Allen

Two masked men set upon J. B. Baxter
at the gate of his home at Emeryville on
Saturday evening and beat him badly in
an effort to rob him. Mrs. Baxter alarmed
the neighborhood by her cries and the
masked men were compelled to retreat
without securing their booty.
Mr. Baxter Is the proprietor of the Ca

Emeryville and lives on Watts street,
some little distance from his place of
business. On Saturday evening Mr. Bax
ter asked his wife to come down to his
store In the evening and return home with
him after business hours had closed. To
this fact Mr. Baxter owes his escape from
being robbed, if from no worse a fate.
When Baxter reached a short distance
from his house he stopped to speak to a
man for a moment and his wife preceded
him home. When he reached his gate
he was alone and two men stepped sud
denly out. from a clump of trees and with
out ceremony struck him on Â¦ the head
with a club or sandbag. - Mrs. Baxter
heard his groan as he fell and set up a
cry that brought help. Mr. Baxter was
found on the ground and was taken to his
house, where he was soon revived.

threatened to kill, last night felled
Alexander, Conrad, a fruit peddler,
in, such a manner that his head landed
squarely on the edge of "a concrete step,
crushing his skull so badly that he died

day, when he furnished bonds In the sum
of $5000. -
Conrad and Joseph, according to the lat

former, business associates. â¢ Joseph dis
solved the partnership on account of Con

heavily, and when in his cups would utter
threats against Joseph on account of a
fancied insult. Mora drunk than usual last
night, he demanded to see Joseph while he
was at supper, at 7 o'clock, in the rear of
a store owned by Mrs. Josephine Riegel
huth, corner of Sherman street and Rail
road avenue. He applied vile language to
Joseph and made a feint .to draw a^pistol
from his right hip pocket. Mrs. Reigel
huth interfered; and Conrad â¢ was per
suaded to leave the place..'
After Joseph had finished his supper he
started out for a walk. Conrad was wait
ing for him on the opposite corner, in
front of a saloon. He accosted Joseph and
began Mb â¢ vile use of language again.
Joseph told him he had better go _home,
and in reply came threats from Conrad
that he would fill his ex-partner full of
bulletholes and another attempt to draw

much that he finally struck Conrad a blow

WAR OF THE
LAWYERS IS
FINALLY OVER
Judges Deny All Motions to
Disqualify the Varney
Estate Attorneys.
Goodf ellow, Representing Two Trus
tees, Withdrawsâ Contest Over
Trust to Be Tried by an
Outside Judge.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 27.
THE charges of unprofessional con
duct made by Attorney William ; S.
Goodfellow .' against the law firm of
Bishop & Wheeler have been de
clared to be unfounded ; by: Judge Ells
worth and Judge Ogden, who handed
down a decision to-day denying the mo
tion to disqualify that firm from appear
ing as counsel f or Â¦ the plaintiffs Â¦in the
contest over the Varney estate trust. The
decision likewise declares that Mr. Good
fellow .has perfect standing to represent
all of the trustees, but that the question
of his right to appear for TvH.'B. Varney
individually rests upon the point whether
Varney's liability on a note now in liti
gation shall ; be drawn into the present
controversy.
There were exceptions taken by both
sides to the decision, Mr. Goodfellow ask-
Ing for the customary twenty days In
Â¦which to prepare his bill,' the same motion
coming from Mr. Wheeler upon denial of
his motion to have Mr. Qoodf ellow ex
cluded.
This preliminary battle has ended In a
new turn to the ease. Mr. Goodfellow has
settled all doubt as to his appearance for
Varney Individually by withdrawing In
that capacity. -
To-day Garret McEnerney was substi
tuted. Mr. Goodfellow also created sur
prise by withdrawing as counsel for,Var
ney as trustee and also for H. H. Pitcher,
a second trustee. Reed & Nusbaumer and
A. A. Moore were substituted respective
ly. This action leaves Attorney Goodfel
low the representative in the contest of
only Trustee John Taylor.
On top of all these turns in the per
sonnel of the legal forces for the trus
tees came the announcement by the court
that for various reasons it would be de
sirable that an outside Judge should try
the case. None of the four Judges of the
Alameda County Superior bench could sit
in the trial, and the attorneys, after a
long 1 conference in -chambers, gave way
and cast about for some other Judge. The
name of Judge A. Z. Rhodes of Santa
Clara County was suggested, but Illness
prevented him from accepting the invita
tion. Appeal will be made to either Judge
Hunt or Judge Seawell of San Francisco,
the trial being continued - until to-mor
row afternoon to discover a Judge who
can hear the contest.
The situation from a legal aspect ia In
teresting in that the counsel now arrayed
against each other represent the flower
of- the bar of Calif ornia.,. On the side of
the beneficiaries- who seek. to have- the
trust funds accounted for and a distribu
tion made of a large portion of the es
tate are Bishop & Wheeler and A. J.
Treat, with all the forces of that eminent
firm. :
The three trustees have as representa
tives W. S. Goodfellow, A. A. Moore, Gar
ret McEnerney and Reed & Nusbaumer.
There Is involved in the contest from
$350,000 to $400,000, a large portion of which
is invested in the Bank of Livermore, of
which Trustee Pitcher is the manager.
The beneficiaries of the estate of the late
Thomas Varney, who complain, i declare
that a" large amount of the estate is un
necessarily tied up to meet provisions of
the trust, which they claim requires only
$3500 annually to meet its requirements.
In their decision on disqualification
Judges Ellsworth and Ogden agreed on
all points. After reciting a general record
of the litigation and the connection of the
attorneys with it, the opinion reaches to
the time Mr. Goodfellow turned over t to
Attorney (now Superior Judge) S. P. Hall
the transcript taken when the second ac
count of the trustees was settled and suit
on a note for $23,000 was ordered against
Varney. In this transcript, the court
says Varney'B reasons were fully stated
for his repudiating the note and why he
thought he was not liable on it. .- Refer
ence is made to the transfer of the suit
brought by Mr. Hall to Mr. Earl, and the
latter's later connection with the firm of
Bishop & Wheeler. The decision says:
"Mr Earl took necessary steps to bring
to a close this case of Pitcher and Taylor
airainst Thomas H. B. Varney, and during
the progress of the litigation had a con
sultation with Mr. Pitcher of about
thirty minutes. There is no pretense made
here that any matter, save this note and
the attendant litigation over it, was" dis
cussed or that at this or any other time
either of the trustees ever consulted with
Mr Earl or Mr. Treat or Messrs. Bishop
& Wheeler about the management of their
tF As to Mr. Treat's standing the court
said: .;.,-Â¦
'Mr Treat examined into said estate,
nhtninlnr what' information ; he - could from
papen. interviewed Judee Nye. and a.
well in regard to the testimony upon nettle
_ mt O f the second account. No Information
waii conveyed to him by either Hall or Earl,
but on the s contrary, .It was obtained fairly
and' In the proper conduct -of an attorney's
business. Thereafter Treat consulted "with
Wheeler with reference to the law point! In
volved In the present action and thereafter
the firm of Bishop & Wheeler, with Mr. Treat,
were retained to prosecute the present action.
Mr Earl had never consulted with Bishop &
Wheeler with reference to thÂ« suit of Pitcher
vs. Varney and the firm had no Interest In his
* *AltoÂ«ther the' facts so disclosed show the
utmost rood faith onr ttÂ» part of Mr. Treat.
Bishop & Wheeler and Mr. Earl , in the trans
action of the various businesses committed to
So far as appears from the evidence here thrf
action of Pitcher - et al. vs. Varney was upon
a Â¦ promissory notÂ«; the - facts relating: to =. its
execution and the defense of Varney to It were
not matters of secrecy or concealment. Varney
testified fully concerning it upon the < settle
ment of > the - account in the - Probate Court.
No issue could be made In Â¦ that case Involv
ing 'â¢Â¦ the administration of the trust estate ior
calling ; for any Investigation ' into the action
of the I trustees ! with ' reference to : the benefi
ciaries ' under the I trust." â¢ It . was â¢ an ! action In

PRINCIPALS TO THE ENGAGEMENT
CONTRACT. .
COPY OF MISS GREEN'S ACKNOWL
EDGMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT
WITH MR. LYNCH AND HER SUBSE
QUENT NOTICE THAT IT WAS
BROKEN OFF. '
HENRY H. LYNCH and Miss Ma
rian G. Green are the hero and
heroine of an absolutely new deal
âan engagement contract. Lynch
eigsed the contract. Miss Green drew It
up. These facts are admitted by Lynch.
But in epite of the fact that therein
Lynch promises to marry Miss Green as
soon as he is free to do so, the engage
ment has been annulled. Lynch's wife
died two months ago. He is a free man,
but be says he will not place a plain
golden circlet on Miss Green's third finger,
left hand.
Ban Francisco has had its Sharon mar
riage agreements and its Craven-Fair
contracts, but the Lynch-Green engage
ment document is the city's very latest in
that line.
The Call has been in possession of the
Information for some time, but did not feel
Justified in malting the matter public until
the signer of the document could be seen
and was given an opportunity to make a
statement concerning the part he played
in the creation of the new matrimonial
industrj'-
Mow, however, that there are prospects
of legal complications arising from the
compact the attair becomes a matter of
pubUc concern. Miss Green has already
consulted an attorney 'to ascertain the
ctrexieth of her claim against the railroad
p-mn
In an Interview yesterday he admitted
having signed the contract, told the cir
cunxbtancesj under which it was executed
&n4 aÂ«ua thai now he had no idea of rul
xunni me agreement.
Lynch, wno is the superintendent of
construction of the Marnet Jstreet Rail
way tiyetem. wooed and won Miss Ma
rian Green more than three years ago. At
that ume there was one serious oDstacle
to the union of the fond coupleâ a wife,
and co the wedding day was, perforce,
postponed until such a time as the law
or Providence would make the union leg
ally possible.
It was at this stage of the proceedings
that Auss Green thought of an engage
meat contract and the ardent wooer
signed it. The contract was legally built,
and should the matter be brougnt to a
court of law Mr. Lynch will nnd that
though he has withdrawn his promise to
wed. Miss Green is still his betrothed
wife. ...
Miss Green's object In getting an en
gagement contract was simply a matter
cf guarantee that Hymen finally awaited
her. Wooers the young lady had by the
score, but to all she gave a ' tirm, low
"Nay, nay," reserving her hand for Mr.
Lynch when he should be free to claim it.
A particularly persistent euitor brought
matters to a climax. Miss Green's people
favored his suit. They brought all tne
force of their love and powers of persua
sion to help matters along, but their
daughter would have none of him. Then
the anxious parents began to tell the
daughter fables about fastidious girls
who waited too long for the right man to
come, and finally . found themselves
passee, unsoupht for and "left."
The force of these parental arguments
did not go unheeded. Miss Green drew
up her engagement contract, the railroad
nian signed it and the lady took charge
of the agreement, which decreed that the
lot of an old maid was not to be hers.
Finally, in the course of human events,
the wedding of the pair who had loved so
long and secretly was to be a happy pos
sibility. The divorce court was not to be
the stepping stone to their happiness.
Mrs. Lynch passed away two months ago

CITY IS OFFERED
NEW WATER SUPPLY
Hot Rival of Spring Valley Proposes
to Tap Lake Tahoe and Fur
nish a Fine Article to the
Municipality for Twenty-Five
Million Dollars.
SAN FRANCISCO may yet own its
, water works. The call issued by
the Board of Supervisors for a
water supply has borne fruit, as
a number of Eastern and local
capitalists have offered to supply this mu
nicipality with water from Lake Tahoe,
by means of canals and pipe lines, and
furnish the Inhabitants of this city with
double the supply they are now receiving
from the Spring Valley Water Company.
They offer to construct the works and
turn it over to the city when completed
for $25,000,000, and they will not ask for a
penny until the city's engineers have ac
cepted the plant.
The foregoing was developed at a meet
ing held in the offices of Colonel yon
Schmidt, In the Pioneer building, yester
day morning. The members of the Com
mittee on Public. Utilities, composed, of
Supervisors Reed, Hotallng and Maguire,
and City Engineer Grunsky, Commissioner
Marsden | Hanson of the Board of Public
Works were present at the meeting, which
was held at the invitation of Colonel yon
Schmidt. ' There were also present ' E
ngineers A. M. Hunt and Dillman, who rep
resented the capitalists who propose to
carry out the gigantic scheme.
The meeting was brought about through
a statement made by, Colonel yon Schmidt
while a witness in the water company
Investigation. At that time he Informed
the Supervisors that the amount of water
supplied by the Spring Valley -.Water
Company â thirty million gallons â could be
brought down - from Lake Tahoe for fif
teen or sixteen million dollars. Â¦ This state
ment in the face of the testimony given
by the. engineers Â¦of the water company,
that their plant was worth thirty million
dollars was deeply considered by the Su
pervisors. At that time Colonel â¢ yon
Schmidt was invited .by Chairman Reed
of the Committee on Public Utilities t .to
appear before the committee and give a
further explanation, of what: he stated on
the witness . stand. Â¦ He therefore Invited
the members of the committee to his of
fice, as he could better/ submit , his data
and maps on the subject..' Â¦ -v . ' .-., â¢Â¦Â¦ â¢ :
When ; the ; members of ? the committee
arrived at the office they found | Mr.' Dili
man and A. '.- M. Hunt, engineer of the
Independent"" Light " and: ~ Power Com-
Sany. who appeared before . the board on
londay last in the Interests of that cor
poration. ' In a conversation with --Â¦- Mr.
Reed and others at that ! time , Mr. Hunt
took occasion to discuss the Yon Schmidt
scheme and said that the proposition to
bring water from t Lake Â¦ Tahoe was : feas
ible; that he had gone over the;project
and was perfectly familiar with -it and
had made estimates. of the cost, and < that
himself and another engineer named Dili
man had been instructed to look Into the
matter and make their estimates and see
whether, the scheme was a practical one.
what the cost would be and whether the
right was reserved kin â¢ Colonel ; yon
Schmidt's company. , - i. jWv. -. =
The -meeting was an informal one and
practically developed Into a discussion of
the proposition. ; . â¢ ...
Colonel yon Schmidt stated that he had
the backing of capitalists, who were
ready *to put up their money to go ahead
immediately, if the city gave them v en
couragement. ;He ; told * how : i he j and ; a
Colonel . Simpson, In ' 1872/ had - built a . dam
at the outlet of Lake Tahoe, by which he
. had ; raised the : entire surface Â«of Tahoe
five feet; that * every foot added to . the
surfaco of the lake represented 147,000,000
ganons a day for a year, and five feet
represented a -five years' supply. As the
water in the lake is filled up every winter
by violent storms and the melting of. the
perpetual snows of the Sierras, it was im
possible to conceive of any state less than
a full lake once a year, while the over
flow goes into the Truckee at the rate of
over 100,000,000 gallons a day, and can be
used by any' of the riparian owners on the
Truckee River without interfering in the
slightest degree with the rights of the
Yon Schmidt Company. . Â¦
. Messrs. Dillman and Hunt stated that
they, and the people they represented
were satisfied that the scheme was a feas
ible one; that there is 147,000,000 gallons of
water a. day at the disposal of any com
pany; that . will take up v Von Schmidt's
rights. Â» v *
â¢ "We will offer in response to the call
issued by- the > Supervisors," said Mr.
Hunt, "to sell to this city and county our
rights to 147,000,000 gallons a day for five
years; .will construct dams, ditches, tun
nels and pipe lines necessary to. bring 60,
000,000 gallons a day to San Francisco and
discharge it 300 feet above the sea at any
point in '.this city; guarantee the volume
. of: water and ViO: the work according - to
the plans and. specifications of the Board
of Public Works and guarantee the title,
for $25,000 000, no money v to be paid until
the work is completed.
' Â¦ The v plan , which r- these engineers out
line Is to build a new. and: more perma
nent plant on .the > site I of , Yon Schmidt's
present dam on the Truckee River, thence
carrying the water three miles along the
bed of the Truckee River, thence by canal
five miles > in ' length, thence through the
Sierra Nevadas In a tunnel five miles long,
thence in another canal to one of the up
per channels of the American River and
to carry the water in the bed of the river
for some miles and take it out by another
canal to Auburn and from Auburn to San
Francisco in pipe lines." ;,: v
-Â¦The full 147 million gallons a day will be
brought to Auburn by ; this system of
canal and tunnels.- From Auburn. to San
Francisco the i water , will Â¦; be - brought ', In
either - by; one ' or; two ' pipe lines. â¢ Sixty
million gallons a> day will be twice -the
total capacity of the Spring Valley Water
Company as . it | Is ; at â¢ present I constituted.
The i total ) consumption of I water -in | this
city at the present Â¦ time Is ; about twenty
five million gallons : a day, ' so . that this
proposition is to supply the city with more
than;- double 1 actual dally needs, and
with a right to almost six times its actual
needs. : '^-->.Â«jÂ«>;fyÂ«pÂ°Â«r,'ffj>fat|Â«jaÂ«iÂ«UÃiWjMayq
MVhen this city doubles In population, so
that |it will need more than 60,000,000 gal
lons a day,* it will only have to .build an
other Â¦Â¦: pipe . line\; and i draw upon ; its tre
mendous reserve force," amounting, to near
! ly 97.000,000 gallons a day. v. ln other.words.
1 the proposition of Engineers Dillman and
Hunt: is. to sell to thia city" practically a
supply of water adequate i for a?, city ; of
2,000,000 inhabitants, and -actually ."deliver
within the t city limits. ; at v 300 - feet above

pleted beforelt Is accepted, by, the city.-'
Identity Is known, and if the plans of the
police do not fall they will be In custody
within a very short time. Both Jobs were
done by three men. who have traveled all
over the country, robbing safes and in
cidentally holding up belated citizens.
They are Eastern crooks, and are said to
be expert safe crackers.
It has been learned by the police that
the reason the desperate trio did not suc
ceed in boring into me vault of the French
bank was due to a policeman who hap
pened to be standing in front of the Cali
fornia-street station at the time. While
two of the men were making vigorous ef
forts to reach the bank vault the third
remained outside to warn them in case
their operations were discovered. Seeing
a "copper" standing in front of the police
station, and suspecting that he was await
ing an opportunity to arrest his confed
erates, he gave a warning whistle and dis
appeared down the street. Shortly after
ward he was joined by the safe crackers,
who had left the bank on hearing the
whistle.
After the Job had been discovered the
"wise" policeman who stood in front of
the station recalled seeing the third rob
ber and hearing him whistle the warning
to his companions. He explained that he
did not know that the safe crackers were
at work and paid no attention to the
stranger and his queer whistle. He de
scribed him as being well dressed, about
35 years of agre. and as clean shaven. The
officer Is positive that he wore a light box
overcoat of expensive material. As the
"copper" worked in a tailoring establish
ment prior to his being appointed a mem
ber of the police force the description he
gave of the overcoat that the robber wore
has not been questioned.
The same methods were used by the rob
bers while trying to reach the vault 1 in Su
tro's Bank. The man with the "box over
coat" remained outside while his compan
ions vainly endeavored to dig into the
bank. While they were at work a citizen
happened to pass by, and thinking he was
a policeman in citizen's clothes the look
out hurriedly gave the alarm. As his con
federates emerged from the bank they
saw a man standing on the corner, and
taking him 'for the third robber they
crossed over to where he was standing.
To their surprise the man was a police
man, and after realizing, their mistake
they quickened their pace and disappeared
down the street.
After the attempted Â» robbery was dis
covered the police officer remembered see
ing the two men in the -vicinity of the
bank, but as they were well dressed and
did not look like crooks he paid no atten
tion to them. He, however, has furnished
the detectives with a meager description
of them. . -
Yesterday the sleuths of the "upper of
fice" were engaged In examining the reg
isters of the various hotels in the hope of
getting a clew to the daring robbers. As
they patronize only the best hostelries
Captain of Detectives Bohen is satisfied
that they are stopping at one of the lead-

PRINCE CUPID
WILL MAKE HIS
HOME IN LONDON
His Hawaiian Home Has
Lost All Attraction
for Him.
Prince Kuluo Kalanlanaole, better
known as Prince "Cupid," the younger
and better looking ; of the two surviving
Princes of the Hawaiian house of Kala
kaua, arrived from Honolulu on the Aus
tralia yesterday. His wife accompanies
him, and they have taken apartments at
the Palace hotel, where they will remain
during a stay of a fortnight or more In
San Francisco.
Prince Cupid 1b setting out on al ong
deferred tour of the world that will ex
tend over an Indefinite period of time.
It is now about two years since the Dow
feger Queen Kaplolanl made over the bulk
of her property to her nephews, Princes
David and Cupid. It was a bis fortune
then, but since it has increased many fold
and both young men are very rich. Prince
David is well known here, having spent
the greater portion of the present winter
In this city. He made his mark as a
swell * dresser and dignified - man of the
world, and spent money like a Prince.
It has been ten yearn since Cupid visit
ed this city. ,He was last here while on
his. way from London, where he had been
at school, to Honolulu. Now, with money
to burn, good looks, good health and a
host of friends, he Is going out to see the
world. And he may never return to his
native land. His people are broken â¢up
and scattered, he says, and Hawaii â¢ has
no longer ' any - charm for him. On -. the
other hand, his recollections of ; London
are so pleasant that he seriously contem
plates buying a fine place there and set
tling down for life. . ? - .
But Just now Cupid is going sight -see-
Ing. After doing Chicago and New York
he and his wife will visit the World's Fair
and then travel through Europe, continu
ing on arounrt the world,*. visiting . India,
China. Japan, Australia and every other
land that can -be reached by steam.
MORGUE WAGON STRUCK
BY AN ELECTRIC GAR
Deputy Flanagan, Unwarned by the
Bell, Besorts to His Wit to
Prevent Disaster.
As a result of what appears to be crim
inal neglect on the part of motorman No.
1060, on the Fillmore-street line, the pub
lice, morgue wagon was struck by a car,
badly wrecked and- Deputies Brown and
Flanagan had a narrow, escape from
death yesterday afternoon at the corner
of Post and Fillraore . streets.
The Morgue deputies were answering a
call to the Â¦ French Hospital and drove
along Post street until they reached Fill
more. Hardly had they started to cross
the latter street when they saw that
electric car No. 1022, which was dashing
along at a high rate of speed, was almost
upon them. No warning had been sounded
by the motorman and for a minute a col
lision cemed unavoidable. Deputy Flana
agan, who held the reins, with presence
of mind suddenly cramped the wagon and
swung the horse off the track. The car,
however, Â¦ struck . the Â¦ left side of the
wagon Injuring a horse and breaking a
shaft and wheel. ~
The deputies are positive that the mo
torman, who refused to give . his name,
did not warn them of his approach by
ringing, his belL . In this statement they
have the corroboration of the passengers
on the car, among whom were Miss E.
Lahey, 1028 Treat avenue; Miss Mary
Rhodes, 1333 Eddy street; M. Quirk, 17V4
Mission street, and Miss Downs, 13 Eliza
beth street. ,
The firemen of engine No. 22 were also
witnesses to the affair, and Driver O'Con
nor-made -the- statement that accidents
frequently happen from the failure of thft
motormen on the electric line to ring their
bells when ; they ' pass by at a high rate
Of speed. The firemen. say that they;ex
pect their apparatus to be demolished
some day when they are responding to an
alarm of fire and , 'only two nirjhts ago a

secret of her engagement contract and
with the exception of . her mother, a
lawyer who was consulted in the matter
and, of course, Mr. Lynch, who signed
it, no one knew of its existence. Miss
Green herself was not inclined to discuss
the matter. She answered questions as to
the engagement contract in the most
evasive manner, and neither positively de
nied nor admitted that she was a party to
it. She claims to still have a warm place
in her heart for Mr. Lynch, and hopes
against hope that the clouds between
them will pass away and that he will
make good his bond.
Mrs. Green, the astute young lady's
mother, was not as discreet as her daugh
ter and freely discussed the contract
which she hones will result in Miss Green
leading Lynch to the altar. . â¢
"It is this way," she said. "I don't see
how the engagement can be broken off.
Lynch has signed a contract which my
and Miss Green decided to publish the an
nouncement of her engagement to the
widower.
Lynch did not look favorably upon the
idea of the world sharing his secret, and
forbade Miss Green to maktt their engage
ment public. Matters went on in the old
secret way for some few more weeks, un
til Monday of last week, when Mies
Green informed the society editor of this
Eaper of her engagement to Henry H.
ynch. When Lynch heard that his be
trothed had given the secret of their at
tachment to the world he was furious. He
declared that after only two months of
widowerhood it was unseemly to announce
his betrothal to the lady who for nearly
three years held his contract to wed. The
result of it all was that Miss Green wrote
another note to The Call's society editor
in which she declared the engagement of
herself and Mr. Lynch was off.
Miss Green has carefully guarded the
daughter holds In which he promised to
wed her just as soon as he is free to do
so. He is free now, and I do not under
stand how he is going to get around that
contract. Miss Green took that engage
ment contract to' a prominent attorney,
and when he read it he* whistled, threw
up his hands and said he did not see how
any man could beat that.
"If Mr. Lynch had secured a divorce
from his wife there would have been none
of this trouble. As a divorced man he
could not have his pick of a bride, but as
a widower with position and means he
probably considers himself a prize in the
matrimonial market.'.'
Miss Green, to whom * belongs the honor
of being the originator of an engage
ment contract, is a handsome, stylish
blonde, attractive and accomplished. She
is the daughter of the late Edward Green
of the O. and O. S." S. C 0 .,. and resides with
her mother at 98 Devlsadero street.

Detectives Attempt to Locate" Money
and Wife of. a Prominent Shoe
Merchant in the Chinese
Soon Toy, the pretty wife of Hang Hop.
one of the most prominent' merchants In
Chinatown,' has disappeared and' under
circumstances which : have led the police
to suspect that ; foul * play has been re
sorted to. A mysterious letter received by
her husband yesterday and placed In the
hands of the police caused the officers to
work energetically last night In an effort
to clear up the mystery .and gain some
clew as to the whereabouts of the woman.
Two years ago Hang Hop purchased his
now missing .wife from; a Chinese slave
dealer. The woman passed into his pos
session under a ban,. due to much trouble
she had< had. with Â¦ previous , owners, ; and
Hop's marital state did not afford much
in the way of felicity.- Several times at
tempts were made to kidnap her, and her
husband had always to . fear evil from
Jealous lovers."
. On Thursday, March 17, the woman dis
appeared from her home at 919 Stockton
street. She left the place early in the
evening and was not seen again. Her ab
sence became suspicious when she did not
appear on the following morning, and an
investigation disclosed the fact that dur
ing the . night a private : safe had been
opened and. robbed of an amount of
money approximating nearly $1000. The
safe had been secured with keys which
were last In the possession of the woman.
The case was immediately reported to the
California street police station and Detec
tive Ed Gibson was detailed to recover
woman and money. 1 The officer has been
unable to strike â¢anything in the nature of
a clew." . Â¦ Â¦- .- .Â¦ . Â¦ .
Yesterday a peculiar letter was received
by the merchant. Â¦ It purported to have
been written *by his missing wife, but
was not in her handwriting. It assured
her. friends that she was all right and in
one of the Interior towns, but the missive
had been mailed In uus city. The letter
was immediately handed over to the po
lice and a diligent search to discover Its
author was made last night.
The Chinese are of the opinion that the
woman was waylaid by some of her for
mer enemies and disposed , of In . some
manner. The keys of the safe were taken
from her and the robbery committed.
Her captors, learning that the police were
making an Investigation, sent the letter
â¢yesterday to mislead the police. If . the
woman Is alive It Is believed. that she Is a
prisoner In some of the dens in the Chi
nese quarter. A reward of $100 has been
offered for her return or for Information
leading to her whereabouts.
There Is a chance that -the woman may
have eloped and herself committed the
robbery, but the husband claims that such
a thing is not probable.
