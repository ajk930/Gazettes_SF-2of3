DUTCH SIM PLY WANTED
TO BE LET ALONE
BALTIMORE, March 25.â An enthusias
tic mass meeting of Boer sympathizers
held here to-day" was addressed by Mon
tagu White, representing the Transvaal
in this country, and Philip Louter Wes
sels, a native of the Orange Free State.
Mr. White said In part:
"The Dutch simply wanted to be let
alone, to live by themselves and remain
free and Independent, the same as Ameri
ca. The war is far from being ended.
Events will follow shortly which will star
tle the world.
"General Cronje's defeat was nothing
for the English to be proud of. The Boer
general was outnumbered ten to one, and
had it nbt been for the terrible situation
he was placed in, the intolerable etench
of dead horses and mules, which was fast
breeding disease, Cronje's gallant band
would have been in the trenches to-day."
Among other things, Mr. Wessels said:
"I want to emphatically deny that there
Is anything like a religious persecution of
the Catholics, Jews or any other denomi
nation in the Transvaal or Free State.
The Roman Catholic church is one of the
most prosperous religious denominations
in South Africa. A Jew is our chief sur
veyor of the Orange Free. State, and an
other JewMs master of 'transportation of

IMPORTANT MISSION

Erx^cial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. March 26.â 1 had a long talk
resterday with a distinguished Boer,
n-hose name 1 cannot disclose, though I
may state that he Is a relative of Presl-
Jent Krugcr. has held political positions
in Transvaal, is one of the . well-known
Boer generals and is very rich. He told
ne many important things, some of which
I am not allowed to repeat, but I can
itate that President Kruger's delegates
rto are coming to Europe bring with
:hem a proposition from the small repub
acs to the great republic of the United
3tate?. My anonymous Boer also de
rlared that there was not the least dajj
fer of the Boers destroying the mines.
"That report," he said, ''must have been
nvented by our enemies. It would mean
\o us merely destroying our own property.
But the war for us hae reached a very
rrttical period. That is why we have hur
ried our delegates over here."
At this point he told me in confidence of
the minion of these delegates. All I can
lay now is that they will, with the utmost
ipeed, repair to Berlin. Brussels and then
Â£o the United States. Their mission is
all Important and of the utmost Interna
:lonal Interest, IV*. .-"Â»; Â¦â¢Â¦.
I asked this relative of President Kru
per what slsnificance he gave to the
"stagger humanity" statement, and he
â¢"The President means that the loss of
3fe will be stupendous. Pretoria has
itrong forts around it, built on the most
modern principles. To take these forts
will be well nigh impossible. Let me tell
you. the Boers will never give in. They
will, when pressed, go north into their
Â»wn territory, a sort of a desert which is
full of brush wood which furnishes end
iess shelter."

Pretoria is being prepared for a siege.

now receive better treatment. They have

At Waterfall, where there are over 3000
prisoners, the camp is unhealthy. Shelter
for the men is insufficient, and there Is
therefore considerable' sickness. The spir

4 Narrowly Averted.;
Special Dispatch to the Call
BOSTON. March 25.â Chile and the United States have trembled on thm
verge of war, over the case' of Fred Moore, .the Boston, absconding- bank
teller. Â¦ This startling fact was disclosed to-day for the first time by Ho- Â¦
ratio N. Allln. the well-known Boston lawyer, counsel for Moore, who has â¢
just returned from".. Chile. Police Inspectors Andrew Houghton and ' John
Harris of Boston were marked as victims of Chilean retribution for the "Balti-'
more incident." Hundreds of. natives awaited the opportunity to assassinate
them while they were In Chile In connection with the Fred Moore case. The
authorities were notified that if harm came to them the deed might precipitate
International hostilities. The Chileans are bitterly hostile to tne United States
in consequence of the "Baltimore massacre," and never have forgiven it.
Inspectors Houghton and Harris were marked men before ever they set foot
on South American, Â¦Â¦oil. All that the. Chilean natives knew of them, was .thati
they came as ' representatives of the. United States, to claim a fugitive who had
sought refuge "on Chilean soil.
-So bitter is the. feeling between the United States and Chile that the Fed- â¢
eral authorities hesitated for a considerable time over the wisdom of further. Irri
tating the Chileans by asking for Moore's return. - They had not misjudged the
situation. ' It had been a long time since two United States officials placed them
selves so recklessly at the mercy, of a Chilean mob as did the two Boston inspec- â¢-
tors. - They laughed at -all precaution- at first, and their,, escapes were many.
The city authorities and the. Chilean- newspapers both threw their sympathy with.
e Mr? Allln said to The Call, man to-night: , . . -.. ?
"They cared â¢ nothing for. peril or threats, yet they, were in a city where ev
erythlng conceivable had been done to inflame the mob against any representa
tive of the United States Government. The natives of European nations residing
in Chile had not permitted the opportunity to be lost to stir up feeling against.*
the United States. The two representatives of our Federal authority. thus were
easily marked men in a city teeming with a species of men that would calmly
hire out to commit a murder for $25. The officers kept the big five-shooters on . "
their hips primed and well. oiled, and they avoided going slumming at night."
""What was the nature of the notice to the Chilean statesmen?" Mr. Allln
was asked. .' *
"They were notified that if the threats of wiping out the 'blot on Chile's
honor* by making victims of the Boston men were carried out. there would be a
new 'Baltimore affair," with all the disagreeable. detailsâ and perhaps a few more
âthat attended the original one, when war had been the alternative if Chile did
not settle our. claim for damages within a limited period of time."

PORTO RICAN
QUESTION TO
BE SETTLED
White House Edict. Goes
Forth to Republican
Leaders.
Compromise Programme Likely to Be
Put Through Before the End
of the Present
Wfeck.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, March 25.
To avoid utter demoralization In the par
ty, the edict has gone forth from the
President and his spokesmen at the Capi
tol to the rank and iile in both houses
that the present week must bring an end
to the muddle over the Porto Rican tariff
question. This determination on the part
of the party leaders to do something,
coupled with the fact that a pretty defi
nite understanding has been reached as to
what should be done, though the method
of procedure remains to be determined,
makes it probable that the tariif question
will be finally disposed of bcfor<? the end
ct the week. As a common ground irotm
â¢which all factions In the party may unite,
thes* general points have Ot?en determined
upon as the party progrjimmts, huvins;
the full support of the President:
A tariff of 15 per cent of Dingley rates,
as proposed by the House bill.
Continuance of the present free list,
â¢which includes all food products, estab
lished by executive order.
Absolute free trade to commerce In two
years or earlier, if the proposed new Leg
islature determine upon some other meth
od of raising revenue for the support of
the government in the meantime.
The method of carrying out this pro
sramme is to be a subject for discussion
at another caucus, or conference, as the
leaders prefer to call it. to be held at 4
o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
PORTO RICAN BILL TO
TAKE UP MUCH TIME
Senate "Will Devote Most of the Week
to a Discussion of the
Question.
"WASHINGTON. March 23.â The Senate
will Â«rive the greater share of its time
again this week to the Porto Rican ques
tion. However, at the beginning of the
week Senator Carter will be given an op
portunity to secure consideration for his
.Alaskan code bill. It is not likely to arouse
any general debate.
The Republican caucus will take the
Porto Rican question in hand again to
morrow. The Republicans who support
the House Porto Rican tariff bill hope to
get the measure out of the caucus after
one sitting, but the free traders are not
so anxious on that score, and the latter
element may delay matters there, as it is
disposed to do in the Senate, with the
hope of receiving Â«ill further encourage
ment from the country at large. Some of
the members of the free trade Republican
element declare their purpose to vote
against the bill if reported without amend
ment. They threaten to offer many
amendments and to make speeches in op
position, and do all in their power to pre
vent the passage of the. bill as it stands,
but the caucus, of course, 'may find a
means of preventing, this open rupture. At
any rate a strong effort will be made in
that direction.
The Democratic Senators will support a
free trade amendment when presented,
but they prefer to have the bill voted
upon unataended. .- . '
The army appropriation bill will be
taken up in the .Mouse to-morrow, and
doubtless will serve for a text for a wide
latitude of discussion on military affairs
in general and the cost of the war es
tablishment under the new condition of
affairs. Three days will be given to the
bill. The bill itself carries no legislation
on the organization of the army, but is
Ftrictly a f upply measure for the army on
its present basis. The latter part of" the
week will be devoted to the naval, the
agricultural or the fortifications appro
priation bill. â¢ ?

ends thus:
"Independence or death! Long live the

There is serious danger of complications
between the State Kuvernment of Ama

The people of the State of Para are bit

of Para and Amazonaa, bended by Dr. In

as in the recent elections.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MO
BRYAN MAY NOT
BE NOMINATED
BY POPULISTS
Likely to Be Saved Embar
rassment of Subscribing
to Their Doctrines.*
It Is Proposed to Have Senator Allen
Named and Then Resign in
Favor of the Democratic .
' Leader.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. March 25.â Should plans now
being considered by leading members of
the Democratic and Populist national or
ganizations ripen into agreement. Colonel j
William J. Bryan will be saved the possi
ble embarrassment of ' being forced to go
before . the country as the regular nomi
nee of the People's party, and therefore
as a subscriber to doctrines which, per
haps, might prejudice his candidacy.
U is proposed by several members of the
People's party national convention to
nominate Senator William V. Allen of Ne
braska for . the Presidency and empower
the executive committee of the party to
fill any vacancy on the ticket that may
result from death, resignation or other
wise. -After the Kansas City convention
of July 4th. at which the promoters of the
plan expect Colonel ' Bryan will be nomi
nated, it is proposed that Senator Allen
withdraw from the People's party ticket
and the executive committee of that or
ganization shall name Colonel Bryan to
till the vacancy. It is provided, further,
in the reported scheme that one condi
tion be made irrevocable in consideration
of the Allen demonstration. It is insisted
by the People's party managers that the
Democrats shall include a direct legisla
tion plank In their platform.
As for the second place on the People's
party ticket, it is said the Populists would
be satisfied if the Democrats select one of

2CUBANS OBJECT TO
THE TAX ON SUGAR
Urge That Seventies Be Baised by t >
the Assessment of Valuable f
Property.
HAVANA. March 25.â Governor Gessral
Wood has recently had Interviews with.
persons of Influence -who have strenuously
urged tha taxation of valuable property
rather than each bag of sugar as It la
manufactured. ' Those who hold this view
contend that under the present system Im
pediments are thrown In the way of pro
duction. They point out that many valu
able estates have been lying Idle and un
productive for years, some even bavins
complete sugar plants. The owners, who
are rich men. are living In Paris, Madrid
and other European cities, quite untaxed
for their property In Cuba. General "Wood
feels that if these properties - are taxed
their owners will be forced either to sell
them or to make them productive.
The meeting called to-day of those fa
voring universal suffrage resulted in a
failure. The only persons present wera
about fifty negroes and several small
boys. ' .

MAY BUILD RAILWAY
THROUGH NAPA VALLEY
W. B. King of Oakland Projects Ban
ning a Line From Vallejo to
Lakeport.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. March 25.â W. B. King of Oak
land has been In this city and tbe upper
Napa Valley for some, time past pushing
a project with a view of building a broad
gauge steam railway through Napa Val
ley from Vallejo to Lakeport, In Lake-
Countyâ that is, If the people of Lake
County will give, the schema the proper
support. :
Mr. King is a practical railroad builder
and has superintended the construction of
railways in Southern California and the
State of Washington. He Is at present a
member of the Independent Transporta
tion Company of Oakland, in which or
ganization E. H. Winship of this city is
also Interested. Mr. King has been trying
to float the bonds of the Clear Lake Elec
tric Power Company for the purpose of
building the proposed electric road In this
valley agitated by that company, but In
this he has not succeeded very welL He
has approached the directors cf the Clear
Lake Company and they have stated that
they will sell the right of way privileges
owned by them to film.
Rev. Richard Wylie, E. H. Wlnshlp, R.
Raymond and T. B. Hutchlnson of this
city are directors of the Clear Lake
Power Company, and have in two years
secured franchises In Napa. Lake. Sol.mo
"and Sonoma counties , for their proposed
electric j railway.- The residents of Lake
County are very desirous of having a
railroad run Into that section, and Mr.
King thinks that it can.be accomplished.
Big Catch of Seals.
ST. JOHNS. N. P.. March 25.â The seal-
Ing steamer Leopard, which took shelter
at Welseyvllle yesterday In consequence
of the storm. Is due here to-morrow morn-
Ing, and other steamers are expected to
arrive during the day. Judging from re
ports thus far received the total number
of seals actually taken by the fleet Is
about 296,000. and the prospect is that this
total wiy be increased by some 60,000 be
fore the season closes. As the entire catch
last year was only 247,000, this year's fig
ures promise to be the best within twenty

KTEKCED, March 24. â The workmen employed In clearing
away the brick foundation of the El Capitan Hotel unearthed a hu
man skeleton this afternoon. It vras found under the oven, and just
how it got there is a mystery. Upon examination it was found that

USES the committee appointed by
the California Miners' Association
reaches Washington Its first busi
ness will be to try to secure the
construction of restraining dams
to permit of thÂ© early resumption of
'hydraulic mining on a large scale* There
â¢is {MO.OOO on hand for the beginning of
th* work of dam building. The commit-
HtoÂ«Â» which consists of Attorney General
t Tlrey t*. Ford and A. Camlnettl. will urge

â¢xrf the mineral lands bllL The bill for
ithe protection of the mineral claimants
'-zo oil lands will also be urged.
The mining news of the week In this
Btate Is rtcn In promises of Increased de
velopment. In tne northern part of the
'State one striking piece of news follows
-another. New oil companies are con
tirmaJy forming in various sections to
?exploit new fields. All the Elgns are hope
; *uL The limit to electrical development
Sb far from being reached. For Instance,
: a writer In the New York Electrical Re
view tells this week of a scheme in Mex
ico to transmit 1000 horsepower over Â£Â»
ijnlles to a group of silver mines. The
rwriter. Louts Bell, thinks that the propo
sition is feasible. Itit> plant would cost
â¢only $250,00), he says. News of the ex
"teopion of dredge mining and the ex
tremely low cost of cheap mining and
milling are signs of the time. There are
Â¦many others familiar to all concerned in
mining development. Some account has
been given of the low cost of operation
of the Spanish mine in Nevada County,
four miles from Washington. Horace F.
Brown has been looking the matter up
and he writes that probably the record
of this mine has never been equaled and
certainly never broken for cost of opera
tion and the tonnage worked In propor
tion to the labor employed. It is credited
mith paying a prom, from ores carrying
but 65 cents per ton ana has a special
record for work still more phenomenal.
Superintendent Kimble of the Klmble
gravel mine in El Dorado County, which
is about a mile south of Placervllle. says
he has kept a record and has been able
to mine and mill jjravc-l at the rate of
&. oÂ»Â»ntE per car-load of 13VJ pounds. How
the latter is effected is expia'ned by the
Xl Dorado Republican as lollows:
At present they are taking out a hard ce
mented blue gravel irom breasts 40 to 71 feet
wide and from 2Vi to Â» feet deep, which Is car-
Tied over T rails an average distance oÂ£ 2000
feet to the ore bin. Thence it passes through
i^lf-feedera to the ten stamps. The gravel is
' composed of quartx, flate and rhyollte lava
r-ebbles imbedded in the cementing material.
â¢It is ail blasted. The bedrock is slate of
medium hardness.
The stamps are 6SO pounds, xrith from 5 to 6
inches drop and a speed of from V 6 to 110 drops
rer minute. A coarse screen and high dis
charge are used. The discharge Js 6 inches,
with a. four-hole screen. 14 Inches wide. When
Â»-t!ie crushed travel conies from the mill after
this process, the cementing material Is en
tirely dissolved into its constituents of sand,
â¢ nujd. etc., and the pebbles of slate and quartz
.are crushed to about the fineness of grains
tci wheat. A caving is effected In getting rid
Cf this hard material without crushing it urÂ»
Â¦ aeceeearlly fine, as it contains no gold. No
culckeilver Is used In the battery and no plates
:are used anywhere. The tailings flow over a
; seriee of riffles perhaps 60 feet in length. They
are wooden â¢'cross riffles." that Is. at right
anrles to the How. each beveled from the upper
' tif> of Its lower elde at an angle of 4a degrees,
fine result Is a peculiar action of the water
rj,y which It dances as though a heavy rain
â¢ Â¦no-re falllnc In It and the sand between the
: riffles never packs, but remains open to gold
' deposit and amalgamation.
The mill can dispose of 322 carloads. 1300
â¢pouadÂ» eachâ the capacity of the ore-binâ ln a
iron cf twenty- four hours. Power Is developed
'by a six-foot Hendy wheel under a pressure
â¢of ITS feet. Wages In the mine are 12 50 for
Ijnlnere and *2 for car men. working shirts of
' nine hours.
The Standard Electric Company's work
on the Mokelumne River at Big Bar is
Â¦ now employing several hundred men, and
'there will "be a force of 500 soon. The
mountain road to the site of the new plant
Â¦ B.t Whites Bar has been completed. It
â¢lollows the river grade. The work on the
trench for the pipe line is under way
Â¦This trench will be 4000 feet long and will
carry two thirty-Inch pipes laid in cement.
The site for the plant will be on the old
"Whites Bar mine, and the surface Is to bo
hycraulicked off to. expose the bedrock
for the foundation of the new plant, which
Â¦will be of 15,000 horsepower. The company
*ls also constructing a reservoir from

Indian Valley will soon have In opera
tion one of the largest mining plants ever
established in Plumas County. It will be
located on the north arm of Indian Val
ley, on the ranch of W. T. Peter. The
shaft is 170 feet below the level of that
part of the valley, or 490 feet below the
apex of the vein. There are now 425 feet
of cross-cut tunnels and 475 feet of drift
ing on the veins. In prosecuting the de
velopment work 1400 tons of ore have been
placed on the dump. The Bulletin says:
"The property will be operated on a scale
rivaling that on which the Plumas Eu
reka was mined for a quarter of a cen
tury. This, with other propositions now
opening up, means a renewal of prosper
ity In Indian Valley, the garden spot of
Plumas."
The Mount Shasta gold mines on Clear
Creek, are reported to be about to resume
operations. Preparations are making for
sinking the shaft below the place where
it stopped when the mines were closed
down. Nearly 100 men were employed
there last year. The Texas Consolidated
gold mine in Old Digging, according to
the Redding Free Press, is also about to
resume work. A gang of men has been
busied getting ready for the reopening.
The mill on the river bank will not be
used for the present. The ore will be
transmitted by cable tramway to the
smelters. The Texas mine was turned
over to the trustees some time ago by R.
G. Hart for the benefit of his creditors
and by them bonded to H. C. Woodrow
and C. C. Bush for eighteen months.
The site of the De Lamar smelter has
been selected. It will be placed on the
claims purchased by Captain de Lamar
some months ago, about five-eighths of a
mile southeast of the Bully Hill mine and
about two and a half miles northeast of
Copper City. The smelter will have a ca
pacity of 150 tons per day, which was the
capacity of the original smelter at Kes
wick. The Mountain Copper Company
now has three of these furnaces. A re
finery will be constructed In connection
with the emelter. The site is upon what
has been known as the Popejoy placer
claims. The local papers are predicting
that a second Keswick is about to arise.
Porter L>alrd r a prospector, is dry wash-
Ing what was once the main street of La
Paz, Ariz., about 125 miles north of Yuma.
This was once a prosperous mining camp,
but for twenty years or more has been
only a little cluster of adobes, in little
better condition than are the ruins of
Casa Grande. Several millions of dollars
were taken out of the heaps of sand and
then the claims seemed to peter out. Por
ter Laird says he has found that there Is
enough gold In the streets to make mining
prontable and he is making wages. The
gravel banks along the Colorado are sup
posed to contain considerable gold and
several companies are preparing to op
erate dredgers to bring the auriferous
Fands from the river bed and extract the
dust by means of the usual sluices and
riffles.
There Is a curious condition of affairs
at Randsburg. The Jim Crow mine is in
the middle of the most used thoroughfare
of the town and takes, up 600 feet of
ground ln^ne direction and 1500 feet in
another. Tnis land has been patented by
the owners, who are laying it off into
town lots and asking a fixed price per
front foot for it Many stores and other
buildings are on the ground and the oc
cupants are making a lively kick over
what they style extortion. They have
held undisputed possession of the prop
erty about three years. They do not dis
pute that the owners of the claim have
the right to the minerals in the ground,
but they stoutly assert that they have a
right to the surface. The matter may
rind its way into court.
G. L. Carr of Carrvllle, Trinity County,
has just purchased a concentrator, mill,
rock breaker and engine and boiler for
the Yellow Rose of Texas mine on Coffee
Creek. James Connors has purchased a
fifth interest in the Happy Thought,
Rockery and Hawkeye quartz mining
claims from Earl D. Blowers, James
Drennan, William Schweitzer and M. L.
Barker. The Herzog. Morley and other
claims on French Creek, about eight miles
south of Etna, -Slsklyou County, have
been bonded by Q. V. Green, Davld ; Jones
and others, who will erect a smelter. E.
D. Boyle has bought a two-thirds interest
in the Stevenson mine in Lower Gold Hill,
Nev., from Theodore Washburn and Jo
seph Mills. One-half of the Blrdlnia
quartz mine at Campe Sece has been sold
to James Corrigan.
The substance of a recent ruling: of the
Commissioner of the United States Land
Office at Washington, D. C. is that a
patent on mineral land must be carried
through without delay. The person who
makes his application for entry must pro
ceed with his case or he loses all his
rights after a reasonable time has elapsed.
The custom has been to apply for Â¦ a
patent and then in many cases to allow
the matter to rest for years. The Com
missioner ba?es his ruling on section 2324
of the Revised Statutes.
The use of dredgers in mining is rapidly
increasing. There are eight dredgers
launched near Oroville. A dredger la at
work on the Trinity River at Poker Bar.
Pittsburg capitalists are interested in
a dreglng proposition twenty miles further
up the river. Other portions of Trinity
County and parts of Sisklyou are to be
come tleld6 for dredger mining. A dredger
has Just beea launched at Yreka Creek
at Sisklyou and machinery is now being
placed.
The total production of metals In the
Dominion of Canada as Just reported by
the Geographical Survey of Canada dur
ing the year 1839 was r25.533.717. The gold
output of the Yukon district was $16,-
CKW.oOO and the gold from all other parts
amounted to $5,049,730. The copper output
amounted to J2.653.319: silver, J1.533.371;
nickel. J2.0C7.840; iron. 5248,372; lead. $377,
250. The total production, metallic and
non-metallic ores, wÂ«s $47,275,512. as
against $38,651,010 In 1898. an increase of
22.2 per cent. Of this 15.52 per cent is cred
ited to the increased output of gold from
the placers in Yukon. 2.52 per cent to the
increase in other metallic products and
3.84 per cent to the growth of the non
metaJllc mineral Industries. Gold I leads
the way with 44.53 per cent, coal 19.12,-cop
per 6.62, silver 3.88. nickel 4.37 â¢ and - lead
2.07 per cent. With the exception of a
slight falling off in the value of the asbes
tos all the other chief minerals show con
siderable advances, both in amount and
value. Inspection of the figures shows
this especially to be the case in the ce
ment and coke making industries.'

CARTER'S PLEA FOR THE
RESIDENTS OF ALASKA
Montana Senator Will To-Day Call
. Up the Territorial Code Bill
. for Consideration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March JS. â Senator
Carter will endeavor to call up the Alas
kan code bill for consideration to-morrow.
Speaking of the great mineral wealth of
Alaska and the necessity for the passage
of the bill; he said to-day:
. "The Transvaal, Australia and Califor
nia and all gold producing fields known
to history fall into insignificance as com
pared with the volume of precious metals
to flow from the Alaskan mines. The dis
trict of Alaska. has yielded to the treas
ury of the United States and to the peo
ple of 'the country, a million dollars for
every thousand invested, in purchase, and
is destined to be the great unfailing gold
supply for this country. I am anxious to
see the people of Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines, taken care of: but the people of
Alaska come home to us. They are of
our own flesh and blood. -They go there
from every State and Territory in the Un
ion. Do not force them to protect them
selves as best they can from the strong
arm of mob law. The Senate should pass
the bill providing for their. government."

TWO MEN ARRESTED
FOR STEALING CATTLE
Accused of Systematically Disposing

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, March .25.â A warrant was
sworn out by H. C. Simmons for the ar
rest of William Swearinger and Albert
Myers Saturday, " charged with cattle
stealing. Swearinger and Myers were ar
rested this morning by " Deputy .' Sheriff
Redwine and are now in his custody.
Both the accused were in the employe of
Simmons on his ranch, twelve miles east
of Covelo, and while thus engaged, they
made way with their employer's stock.
Some fifteen or twenty head of prime cat
tle are missing, and it is alleged the cat
tle were taken off the ranch and sold to
transient stock buyers by the prisoners.
This morning Swearinger and Myers en
tered a plea of not guilty, the magistrate
holding- them both under J5OO bond,, which
is not yet filed. Swearinger is the young
man who waa recently implicated In â¢ a
horse stealing affair. He Is about 24 years
of age and bears a hard reputation. Nu
merous recent depredations of this char
acter have aroused stock owners and
every effort will be made for a convic
tion. The date of the hearing is delayed
to enable stock men from outlying ranges
to be present. The evidence is expected
to disclose a system of nefarious traffic
on the wholesale order. Other arrests are
expected to follow. - -Â»> Â¦'â¢ ; 2

Condemned Professor Morse
Sold in Seattle for
Nome Trade.
New Steamer for the Mexican Trade.
New and Welcome Regime at the
Ferrics â Grace Barton Be- ,
places the McDowell.
The old Atlantic liner Professor Morse
recently sold to Puget Sound parties was
the one topic of conversation on the water
front yesterday. A vessel with a more
varied career it would be hard to find
on the Pacific Coast, but the crowning
point in her history came when she was
sold to Seattle parties to carry passengers
to Nome, when in fact she lies at the
Presidio a condemned hulk.
The - Prof essor Morse was built in 1866,
In Scotland, for the Marine Investment
Company jof Glasgow. . She was chris
tened the Aline, and for a time ran be
tween England and America. She was not
a success even in those days of early
steamboating and the Marine Investment
Company, getting tired of its bargain,
sold the steamer to South of England
parties, who changed her name to Suf
folk. Under her new cognomon she ran
to New Orleans from Liverpool for a long
time and was finally sold to S. Oterl of
Louisiana. Just about the time her li
cense was to expire the Klondike boom
burst forth and vessels were wanted at
any price. Parties in San 'Francisco of
fered a good price for the old hulk and
It was promptly accepted. Providence
had a great deal to do with her final voy
age, febe had to stop at Sand Point for
repairs and only got through the Straits
of Magellan by a scratch. On her arrival
at Coronel it was never thought she
would get away again, but once more the
boilers were patched up and she flnally
reached San Francisco, "a complete
When "Pat" Galvln, the head of the
syndicate that had purchased the vessel,
looked her over beat once said she was
not fit to go to sea again and sent her
to .".ie Presidio, where she has lain ever
since. A board of survey passed on her
in June, I&3S, and condemned her as un
seaworthv, and ever since the vessel has
been rotting at her moorings.
The Klondike boom has passed, and now
vessels are in demand for the Cape Nome
rush. Captain F. N. Handy, who was in
on the sale of the Professor Morse, waa
one of those caught during the Dawson
excitement. He and others purchased the
old side-wheel steamer Tiger and the
schooner Mary Bldwell. The Tiger used'
to haul the Sausalito freight boats across
the bay and was still in good condition
when purchased by Handy. ' The Inspec
tors of hulls and boilers would not allow
her to take an ocean voyage, however,
and the ojd side-wheeler is still lying in
Oakland Creek.
Handy's brother was an ex-Collector of
Customs at Unalaska, and both of them
formerly lived at 306 Pine street, in this
city. Captain Handy met Dr. F. E. Ad
ams of Seattle here and between them
they purchased the Professor Morse.
Then they got Dr. J. E. Jordan into the
scheme of running her to Nome, and he .
put up $10,000 to secure a managing own
er's share. He sent an agent to San
Francisco and that gentleman, to fore
stall Handy, put the following ad. In the
dally papers:
NOTICE
Is hereby given that no one Is authorized to
order any work done on the Professor Morse
except myself. All work done without a writ
ten order from me j will not be paid for.
J. L. FISHER,
Master and agent for managing owner.
The notice was published on March 13,
and it only took Fisher twenty-four hours
to discover that the Professor Morse was
a wreck. He' telegraphed the facts to
Seattle and now. Dr. Jordan has a war
rant out for. the arrest of Captain Handy.

SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
WHEN the historians" of the future undertake to
analyze the "complex characteristics of our time
they will probably note it as an age of scien
tific discovery. Almost everything else we have done
has been but a result of the scientific advance. The
wonders of telegraphs and telephones and other me
chanical inventions have been due less to the mechan
ism through which they operate than to the discov
ery of the natural forces /which enable us to use them.
It is to the scientist, rather than to the inventor we
owe most of our recent progress in every direction^
from war to industry ; and, moreover, the man of
science is far in advance of the inventor, for he has
made known to us a number of forces which our me
chanics have not "yet devised a means of applying to
useful purposes. .^ â¢-. >4 - - : \> ;

report is interesting as a part of the talk of the day,
but the plan is too far-reaching to be counted as prac

battery on the southern shore of entrance opened fire at thÂ«
phips astern and the McCulloch and the Boston returned the
fire. It will be noted again that the Raleigh is not mentioned.
The official log book of the McCulloch states that at 12:15 a, m.
the Boston fired two shots and this vessel three shots at El
Fraile. The consensus of opinion from such eye witnesses as
I have conversed with on the subject is that the Boston and
McCulloch fired simultaneously, the difference in time, if any.
being in favor of the gun on this vessel.
Exception is also taken to Captain Coghlan'a letter -where h*Â»
says Lieutenant Rodman destroyed the batteries at the en
trance of Manila Bay on May 3, IS9B. Ido not know which
batteries Lieutenant Rodman destroyed, but I do know that
under orders from the Admiral the McCulloch destroyed, and
dismounted the guns at El Fralle, Cabello and Corregidor. thÂ»
guns at El Fralle being thrown into the water. The enclosed
photograph shows a working party from the McCulloch dis
mounting the 8-Inch guns at Corregidor.
The McCulloch has always been modest regarding the small
part she played at Manila, and has never endeavored to usurp
any of the glory 'which belongs to the brilliant record of thÂ»
Raleigh, but it is her due when she claims the first shot rather
than the Raleigh, a" the circumstances go to show tnat thÂ«
honor either belongs to the McCulloch or Boston, but all things
considered. I think the former has the right to claim the honor.

NEW FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS.
WHILE little or nothing is seemingly being
done at Washington to promote the Western
movement for the creation of a Department of
Mines and Mining, to be presided over by a Secretary
of Cabinet rank, the Eastern project for. the estab
lishment of a Department of Commerce and Indus
tries appears to-be well advanced and may be at
tained before the close of this session.
The arguments in support of the Department of
Commerce are undoubtedly strong. It is said there
are now no less than twenty bureaus in the various
departments of the Government that hay? charge of
affairs relating either to manufactures or to commerce.
Of these ten are under the direction of the Secretary
of the Treasury, and the others are scattered among
the remaining departments. It would of course be
advisable to combine all of these bureaus under one
head, so that all of them could act together along
established lines of policy instead of being out of
touch with one another, as at present. ; ! ; v
Our exports have now become so enormous it is
time the Government should recognize the importance
of industry and commerce to the welfare of the peo
ple, and use its powers to promote them. Nearly
every great nation in Europe has such a department,
presided over by an officer "with a seat in the Minis;
try. ,As we have now become exporters of manu-*
factured goods* as. well as of raw materials, and need
foreign markets for our products, we shall have to
emulate European countries in : all that tends to ad
vance trade. The creation of a Department of Agri
culture has vastly benefited that industry, and it is
not to.be doubted that' equally good results will flow
from a Department of Commerce.
All of these arguments for the advancement of com
merce and manufactures can with equal if not greater
force be urged in favor of the creation of a Depart
ment of Mines and Mining. At the present time our
mineral affairs are managed or mismanaged by va
rious bureaus having no connection with one another,
and the result is confusion in many subjects that
should be free from any manner of doubt. The min
ing industry, moreover, is common to all sections of
the Union, and is one of, the most productive and
important of our interests. The bill for the estab
lishment of the Department of Commerce has been
favorably reported to the Senate, and it would seem
that the Department of Mines bill might be taken up
at the same time and the passage of both assured by
a co-operation of forces. ..
The Kentucky offer of $100,000 for evidence to con
vict the assassins of Goebel is very large indeed, but
the State seems to be getting the worth of its money,
for the evidence given thus far is sensational enough
to cost double the amount.
The appeal of the Transvaal Republic tp the nations
for intervention might as well be called back. Every
nation on earth has troubles of its own, and not one
of them is looking, around for a chance to" get into
other folks' troubles.
BUSINESS RATHER SLACK-
ALL trade reports continue to point to an enlarg
ing business throughout the country. The
bank clearings last week indicated a falling otf
of 14.9 per cent, and the failures were 192, against 182
during the same week last year.
There is a contradiction here. If business is in
creasing all over the country; if, as the weekly com
mercial reports assert, foreign exports from New
York are breaking all previous records, why should
the bank clearings, which are accepted as the only
correct barometer of trade, show a decrease from
week to week, with now and then an exception?
The fact is business is not increasing. What it trny
do later on is another thing. Prospects for a good
spring and summer trade are satisfactory, and as
money is comparatively easy and abundant there are
no reasons why these prospects should not be real
ized- But as long as the six or seven principal cities
of the country, from New York and Chicago down to
Baltimore, show a loss in current trade, it is evident
that spot business at the great centers is not what it
â¢was a year ago. It would be singular if it were, for
the rush last year was unprecedented.
Some weeks ago it was pointed out that trade con
ditions were irregular, and this condition prevails to
day. Some lines are doing better and others worse.
Thus wool shows rather more tone, but wheat and
corn are lower. Leather is reported in rather better
demand, but hides are depressed and declining. Some
kinds of iron are meeting with more inquiry, while
others are dull and weak. Provisions are advancing
under increasing activity, which is a very good sign,
as brisk times are apt to follow a rise in provisions,
and vice versa. Crop prospects are reported brilliant
except in the central West, where cold weather has
done considerable damage to the. growing wheat. .
Wall street reflects the general unsettled condition
of trade. The public, which has been looking cross
eyed at the market for months, has regained confi
dence, and bought more freely last week than for a
long time. Great interests, too, seized the opportu
nity presented by the new currency bill to further
their stocks, and London appeared as a free pur
chaser. Continued good railway earnings helped
things along, and thus Wall street exhibited more
tone las* week than for some little time. The Pacific
Coast is much more even than the other parts of the
country. Here trade is running along without a
break, except in those lines directly affected by the
Eastern markets such as provisions, wool, hides, etc.
Seldom do the weekly bank clearings fall below those
of last year, and the failures are few. As for the crop
prospects, they are more than flattering. The har
vests this year will be immense unless some unex
pected setback occurs. There is some talk of a light
yield of peaches in <ome localities, but otherwise all
reports from the fruit districts point to large crops.
As for hay and grain, the problem this year is not
how to raise them, but how to get the most money
cut of them. The mining interests have been favored
with sufficient water, and are rapidly making up for
the losses in the .dry years. He is a hard man to
please who is not satisfied with the present outlook'
in California.

MEN FROM THE McCULLOCH DESTROYING GUNS AT CORREGIDOR.
EDITOR of the Call, Dear Sir: Referring to the letter of
Captain Joseph B. Coghlan, U. S. N.. which appeared In
The Call March 19. in which hÂ» endeavors to show that
the U. 8. S. Raleigh was the first ship to fire on the
Spanish battery located at El Fraile on the morning of
May 1, 1898, as the United States fleet steamed into Ma
nila Bay. and while not wishing: to enter into a controversy
with Captain Coffhlan, for whom we all have the greatAt es
teem and respect, I deem it but Justice to the McCulloch to sub
mit the following: facts.
It is a matter of historical record that the gases in the
smoke pipe of the McCulloch ignited, causing a red flame
to extend several feet above the top of the pipe, and in so do
ing disclosed her position to the enemy. Is it not natural to
suppose that under the circumstances she was the object to
draw their fire, and is it not natural to infer that if fired upon
she would be the first to return it? Referring to the report of
Admiral Dewey to the Secretary of the Navy, he says: "After
half the" squadron had 'passed," a battery on the south side of
the channel opened fire, none of the shots taking effect. The
Boston and McCulloch returned the fire."
It will be noticed that the Raleigh is not mentioned, and if
she fired, as Captain Coghlan has asserted, she was so far
away from the rest of the fleet that the report of the gun was
not heard on the flagship." Referring also to the official report
of Captain Ch. V. Gridley, U. S. N., to Admiral Dewey, in which
he says, "After this ship (U. S. S. Olympia) had passed in the
MANUFACTURERS AND THE SHIP
PING BILL.
'lIIIJOR a good many years the manufacturers of
I . the United States were indifferent if not
* antagonistic to shipping interests. Content
with the home market, whose rapidly increasing
demand it seemed they never .would be able to
fully supply, they looked upon foreign commerce
as something which was more or less hostile
to themselves. Ocean ships brought foreign goods
into the country , and took out in return large
quantities of raw material which, the manufacturers
thought should be worked up at home. Consequently
when' they entered upon the campaign of education
in favor of the protective policy they neglected to
include in its scope a system of protection to the
shipping interests of the country.
The recent expansion of our industries has in
creased the output of manufactured goods beyond the
home demand, and we are now shipping such goods
in vast quantities to all parts of the world. The goods,
however, have to be shipped mainly in foreign ves
sels, for we have not a merchant marine equal to our
needs. Our manufacturers and our merchants are
therefore at the mercy of foreign shipowners, and we
lose a good deal of trade that would be ours if we had
as large a merchant fleet as our export industries call
for. Such being the case, the manufacturers are no
longer indifferent on the subject of protection to
American shipping, but are now among the most ear
nest and vigorous workers for it.
A committee of the National Association of Manu
facturers has recently submitted to that, body a report
on the merchant marine bill now before Congress,
and in* doing so has presented one of the strongest
arguments yet made on the issue. The committee
quotes and indorses the statement of Senator Frye:
"It is my opinion that the immediate effect of the
passage of this bill will be to insure, within five years,
the construction of approximately half a million tons
of new ships in American shipyards; to increase the
efficiency of our shipping in the foreign trade at least
threefold in "that time; to largely and permanently
reduce rates of ocean transportation; to thus increase
our export trade; to eventually bring the cost of con
structing ships as low in the United States as it is
elsewhere; to place at all times at the immediate com
mand of the Government effective ships and trained
men; to have our mails carried free, and to gradually
â and I hope rapidly â to put an end to our present
payment of $175,000,000 a year to the foreign shipping
how doing our foreign carrying."
Furthermore the committee adds:
"It is self-evident that American ships can only se
cure cargoes by meeting the rates of their competitors
who now enjoy the trade; thus a competition must
arise, which will insure to American exporters excep
tional 1 opportunities to increase their foreign trade by
reason of reduced rates of transportation which will
follow. Foreign Governments at the present time pay
annually to their merchant ships in subsidies, mail
pay, bounties and other aids " more than j $26,000,000.
During the past fifty years Great Britain has paid to
British ships for 'mail pay,' or subsidies, over $250,
000,000. At the present time vessels are built abroad
more Â¦ cheaply, than in - the United States. They are
operated unde^ the flags of other nations for less
money than under the American flag. The compensa
tion provided in the bill will barely equalize these ad
vantages possessed by foreign over American ships."
It is to be borne in mind that the upbuilding of our
merchant marine will benefit not the manufacturers
only, but the farmers of the country, for the products
of the farms continue to be in need of foreign mar
kets. In fact, there is no great interest of the people
that will not be benefited by it. The products of. our
industries arc increasing rapidly/ and we must have
ships to carry them to the markets of every portion
of the globe.

CHIEF ENGINEER CHALKER
TAKES ISSUE WITH COGHLAN
THE SAN FBANOISCO OAlilj, MOin>AY; MARCH 26, 1900.
ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS.
U! NDER the call for the convention of Repub
lican League clubs at Los Angeles it is pro
-'''vided that "each Republican club in California,
including those of the American Republican College
League, shall be entitled to one delegate at large and
one delegate additional for every twenty-five members
upon its rolls. Organizations of Republican veterans
are especially invited to participate. No club shall be
entitled to representation in the State League con
vention unless it has been organized and in existence
at least ten days prior to the date of the convention.
No person shall be counted for representation in more
than one club. All delegates shall file with the sec
retary of the convention certificates of election signed
by the president and secretary of their club."
The attention of Republicans in districts where no
club exists is directed particularly to the provision
that no club shall be entitled to representation in the
convention unless it has been organized and in exist
ence at least ten days before the date when the con
vention meets. As the convention is to assemble, on
April 27, it will be seen that while there is ample tim-i
for the organization of clubs if prompt action bi
taken, there is no time to spare. Therefore Repub
licans who desire such representation should set about
thÂ« work of club organization at once.*
Another clause of the call which must not be; over
looked is the provision that "each club shall furnish
the secretary of the State League a statement on or
before April 20, 1900, attested by the club secretary,
giving the name of the club and its officers, the names
and addresses of delegates and alternates elected and
also the number of members on the roll of the club."
The work of the convention will be of considerable
Importance to the party and to the campaign. The
clubs represent no faction of the party, nor are they
organized to advance the interests of any candidate
for any office. Their work is that of preparing the
rank and file of the party for a vigorous and loyal
support of Republican principles and policies and
Republican candidates for all offices at stake in the
elections. It is therefore a work in which Repub
licans can harmoniously engage, whatever may be
thetr differences of opinion on minor matters or on
the relative merits of aspirants for Republican nomi
nations.
It is desired that the convention shall be thoroughly
representative not only of the State as a whole, but
of every county and district in it. To attain that ob
ject there mast, of course, be club organizations every-:
where, and consequently the formation of such clubs
is now the work of most pressing urgency upon Re
publican leaders. The one danger that menaces the
party in the coming campaign is that overconfidence
in Republican success may lead to indifference and
apathy in the work which will be required to achieve
victory- Against that danger the local leaders and
workers of the party must guard, and there is no bet
ter way of doing it than that of club organizations.
If there be a strotjg club at work in every voting pre
cinct it will be safe to count California in the Repub
lican column as a foregone conclusion. *

The Democrats held a national conven
tion-In May. 1832, also In Baltimore, and
in similar fashion selected candidates. The
proposition for this convention originated
in New Hampshire, and the object of
those issuing the call was declared to be
"to concentrate the opinion of all the
States." "They believed â¢ â¢ â¢ that the
people would be disposed, after seeing the
good effects of this convention in concil
iating the different and distant sections of
the country, to continue this mode of
nomination.
The national convention did. indeed, be
come from this date a permanent part of
the great "machine" of American party
organization, but there were at first some
lapses and Irregularities. The Democratic
party held diverse views as to the wisdom
of calling a convention before the election
in 1836. It was understood that President
Jackson was determined to manipulate
the convention, if one were called, in the
interest of Van Burenâ the adroit politi
cian who had been the successful "man
ager" of Jackson's political canvasses.
Some of the State Legislatures thereupon
proceeded to nominate a President of their
own choice. The convention was held nev.
ertheless. but nearly half of all the dele
gates present were from the two States of

NAPA SODA WATER.
Important Legal Decision â Trade
Hark Sustained.
For some time past several parties have
been selling water in this market as Napa
Soda,' which waters do not come from
"Napa Soda Springs," . which are the
original fountains "of the genuine "Napa
Soda." : Under these circumstances Col
onel Jackson has brought suit to . enjoin
one of these parties, who, under the cor
porate" name of "Phillips Napa County
Soda Company," has been selling water
as . "Napa Â¦ Soda,'.' which does ' not . come
from his springs, and the following de
cision has just beer! rendered in the case
by.- Judge Hebbard, after an exhaustive
trial running through some weeks: ,
In- the Superior Court of the City and
County of San Francisco, State of Cali
fornia, Department Fourâ J. C. B. Heb
- bard, Judge.
John P. Jackson vs. Phillips Napa County
. Soda Company (a corporation) and 3.
" A. Phillips.
OPINION.
Plaintiff Is the owner of certain mineral
springs in Napa County, California. Ho
has on file in the office of the -Secretary
of State ' his claim to the words, "Jack
son's Napa Soda Springs," as applied to
the property, and the words, "Napa Soda"
as applie- to the waters thereof.
" These words plaintiff . has had for many
years imprinted upon.* the bottles and
boxes used in his business. He claims
that he has a right to the exclusive use
of ? these. words as trade marks or trade
names.
Defendants have, since the adoption by
plaintiff of said names, been selling min
eral yater under the name of "Phillips
Napa County Soda" and "Walters Napa
County Soda," and have had said names
Imprinted upon the bottles and boxes used
in their business, such bottles and boxes
being Â¦of similar size and character aa
plaintiff's. "
Defendants have also sold their product
as "Napa Soda."
" Plaintiff claims that the use iot said
words by defendants constitutes an in
fringement of his trade mark and has In
jured him in his business. He therefore
asks for an Injunction. No certain
amount of damages,, if any. were proven
on the trial, and . plaintiff in his closing
brief waives claim thereto.
Defendants' principal defense Is that the
word "Napa" Is a geographical name and
cannot be made the subject of* a trade
mark. â¢ .
It seems unnecessary to' discuss the
many cases, . some of them conflicting,
wherein Is decided the questions whether
or not a geographical name may be made
the : subject of a trade . mark . at all. or
whether or not a geographical name may
acquire a "secondary. meaning." so as to
become entitled to protection as a trade
.mark,' because : the evidence in this case
shows the "adoption of the name for the
Springs and for the waters before there
was ' such a subdivision '* of the State as
Napa County, or before the name "Napa"
came into our geography. *
It appears that prior to the admission of
California Into the Union as a State there
was a tribe of Indians living 1 in the neigh
borhood .of what : is now : Napa County,
who ' were ; known , as the Napa Indians.
These Indians were the . first patrons of
these springs. ; camping In their vicinity
and drinking the waters, and the springs
were Â¦: then called "Napa Soda! Springs,"
after that tribe. :' '
Whoever .first ; appropriated - these
springs as private - property - does r not
plainly ; appear, but ."it is known ;: that Â¦in
1855 one J. H. Wood was the owner of. and
in possession of said springs, bottling and
selling: its -waters, then and ever-slnce
known' as "Napa : Soda." and that -^thÂ©
title -. thereto. ; together with the right â¢ to
use" the -. name . of "Napa v Soda".; came to
plaintiff ,by irrant,; bargain,- sale and con
veyance in ' 1872/ an d: ever since has been
and. is. now his rtrnprrtT â¢ VpnTrnn' l 'fcl7ilW m
This brief- history ;of the , case Is suffi
cient to show appropriation of the names

FIRST GREAT SEAL. OF THE UNITED STATE 3.
(In use since 1752.)
Virginia and Maryland, while Tennessee,
having appointed no delegates, was repre
sented by a single Tennesseean, who
chanced to be in Baltimore at the time
and took upon himself the responsibility
of casting the vote for his State. The del
egation from each State, whatever its
number, cast that number of votes to
which its State was entitled in the Elec
toral College. Van Buren and Johnson
were nominated. Â«
No convention was held by the Whig
party in 1536, but several nominations were
Irregularly made by conventions In States,
by Legislatures or by Legislative cau
cuses. From that time to the present na
tional conventions have been regularly
held by both the great parties.
Development of the Convention.
The Democratic party has had a longer
and more consistent party history than
any other similar organization, and was
the first to provide itself with, a complete
ly organized and efficient party "ma
chine." All the early conventions, as well
as many of the' more recent ones, 4 have
contributed something to the final settle
ment of vexed questions at rules and
methods, and are all worthy of careful
study.
The national convention of the anti-Ma
sons in 1830 had little political significance,
but is Important as the first and as con
tributing to conventioofjerganizatlon the
suggestion that each SuÃe should send as
many delegates as it had electoral votes.
It was called by a small number of dele
gates, representing ten States, and Its
members were appointed mainly by State
conventions. -,
The national convention of the Na
tional Republicans held In 1831 was called
by the party members of the Maryland
Legislature, the call being addressed to
"those who deprecate the election of An
drew Jackson." The States were asked
to send delegates equal In number to their
Presidential electors. The delegates were
variously chosen; in one State by legis
lative " caucus, In four by State conven
tions, in eight by Congressional districts.
As the role of delegates was called every
man of them, one after another, rose to
his feet and gave the name of Henry Clay
as his candidate.
What is called our third national con
vention was a gathering of young men
which met In May, 1532, in the Interest of
Clay's , candidacy. It might perhaps be
more properly called a ratification meet-
Ing,' but It is made Important In the his
tory of â¢ convention development by the
fact that it adopted a series of resolutions,
"constituting." as Mr. Bryce has said,
"the first political platform ever put forth
by a nominating body." â¢
Later in the same month a national con
vention of the Democratic party" met In
Baltimore and effected a more complete
organization than had any preceding con
vention. The campaign which followed
resulted in the re-election of Jackson.
National Convention Bales.
The history of national conventions Is
henceforth largely a history of their rules
of procedure. These have been adopted
from time to time as the necessity has
arisen, and will be found to vary in "the
two great parties in accordance -with the
fundamental principles which have divid
ed Federalists and Anti-Federalist*. Fed
eralists and Republicans. National Repub
licans and Democratic Republicans,
Whigs and Democrats, and, finally. Re
publicans and Democrats, from the begin
ning of our national history. Upon the
one side Is a jealous fear of encroachment
upon the rights of separate. States; upon
the other a disposition to strengthen the
powers of the Federal Government. Mul
titudes of other questions have at differ
ent times entered Into the contests be
tween the parties and the wrangles be
tween factions within the parties, and on a
few" occasions in our. history the great
jrulf fixed between the parties had seemed
for the time being to be obliterated, but
only to reappear as the shifting of minor
problems clears the vision. It is this one
basal question which has persisted from
the days of -the constitutional debate in
1787-89 obscured now and again, only to
return in its full decisive force. Mr.
Bryce has pointed out a second principle
of opposition between the parties which
he regards as deeper and more pervasive
than- any other. It Is that between two
tendenicesâ "the love of liberty and the
love of order." the Democratic party
standing for the first: the Federalist, the
Whig Â¦ and the Republican party for the
Â°TtÂ°is to' the Democratic convention that
we must look for the most complete and
characteristic development. Jt has had
a continuous history of sixty-seven years,
while the Whig convention was only
achieving a satisfactory organization
when the party came to an end, and the
Republican Â¦ party, which succeeded in
1556 has /had a less uniform and less
striking party history, as .well as more
brief, than has had its opponent. . TgUffit
Choice of Delegates and Their Number
Various' lrregularities In respect to the
choice of delegates . and their admission
to the convention prevailed in ' both par
ties ' for - several - years. Â¦ The â¢"Whits fa
vored in general ,the choosinjc . off dele
gates by = the Congressional districts, "as
being â¢ most democratic - and best calcu
lated to brine â¢ out -'Â¦ the . real sentiments
of the people." (Niles' Register.) The
Republican â¢ convention =of IS92* passed a
rule obliging every State to so elect Its
delegates. . With the Democratic : party
the State convention has been more popu
lar Â¦as ,the organ for. choosing delegates
and is still. in use in some of the States,
the party tendency, to exalt the State in
fluencing â¢ action â¢ here <as elsewhere. \_But
the | Congressional | district convention has
been ' most i widely adapted > for â¢ choosing
the two â¢ delegates to which, the ; district
is itself entitled, while the mat* conven
tion elects * only â¢ the four Â¦ "dtltpatt* at
large" - tor . thÂ« - whoU State. Tn* nuaa-
tional Institution is shown by their re
peated discussions as to the expediency j
of holding such a convention even as lata
as 13U.
The Unit Bule.
The first Democratic convention adopt
ed a rule which, though somewhat vague,
has been- understood to give to the ma
jority of the delegation from any Stata
the right to cast the vote of the State.
This disregards the wishes of the minor
ity in any particular State and at the
same time makes It possible for candi
dates to be nominated who are approved
by a minority only of the party voters of,
the country. But as tending to exalt tha
rights of the State as such, the unit rule
has been much favored by Democratic
State conventions, which have often In
structed their delegates to national con
ventions to vote as a unit. Under some
circumstances the national convention
permits individual voting, but never over
tides State Instructions.
The Whig convention of 18S9 adopted a
cumbrous form of unit rule, but It never
became a part of the regular Whig pro
cedure-
In Republican national conventions tha
unit rule never gained a foothold, though
efforts have been made to impose It upon
the party. In ISSO a rule was adopted
which has since been in force. It requires
that In case any delegate objects to the
announcement made by the chairman oÂ£
his delegation, "the president of the con
vention shall direct the roll of
of such delegation to be called and tha
result recorded In accordance with tha
votes individually given."
The Platform.
In the national convention of the* pres
ent the "platform" occupies a conspicu
ous place. It also has a history and &
growth along with the development of tha
convention Itself, and especially In con
nection with the growth of the idea of tha
authority of the convention. Three Ideas
are now seen to enter necessarily Into a.
political platform. There is first a state
meet of the general fundamental princi
ples for which the party stands. These
having been once formulated, and as not
changing' from year to year, may bÂ»*
merely referred to or assumed In subse
quent documents. Secondly, there is a
conscious effort to set forth a specific
policy to be pursued under existing cir
cumstances and conditions. And, third,
the platform carries with It a pledge,
stated or implied, that the party will be>
true to its historic principles and will
carry out the policy outlined. A modern
platform does not appear in convention
history until 1340, and its development will
be traced in connection with our further
study of party history. Before that time
there were, indeed, many lons popular
addresses put forth by local meetings con
taining statements of party principles;
many criticisms upon administrative acts.
upon- personal' qualities and conduct;
much expressed admiration or reproba
tion of men and things: but nothing
earlier than IS4O will be found to contain
the three elements now deemed essential.
The document which Mr. Bryce calls our
"first political platform" sets forth a spe
cific policy advocated by the national Re
publicans as demanded by the time and
the circumstances, but neither formulates
nor Implies the party's basal principles
nor offers any pledges to the people.
The Convention Established.
Until the national nominating con
vention had become a self-perpetuaang
body it could not be regarded as an es
tablished institutionâ a permanent party
organ. This completion of national party
organization may be conveniently associ
ated with the year 1532. when the Whij?
convention appointed a national central
committee . with power to call the next
national convention. Similar action had
been previously taken by the Democrats.
For nearly half a century no significant
alteration in the procedure of national
nominating conventions appears. -Con
stant criticism has followed the conven
tion and Its rales of action, as It followed
the Congressional caucus, but no system
at all likely to b* successful against It has
yet been proposed.

SCENES AND INCIDENTS DURING THE ELECTION.
CONTRARY to general expectations,
the annual meeting and election of
the French Mutual Benevolent' S
ociety yesterday at Native Sons'
Hall was extraordinarily quiet and
the proceedings were not marred
by a single unpleasant incident. Six hun
dred and thirty-three members cast their
ballots for fifteen directors and three
physicians to administer the affairs of
the hospital during the ensuing year.
Thirty-one ballots were rejected for be
ing Improperly marked.
The names of twenty-four members,
candidates for election to the administra
tion committee, had been printed on the
ballots and the members were cautioned
to cancel the names of nine. There was
no opposition to the election of Dr. de
Chantreau as visiting hospital physician
and Drs. J. Masson and F. R. Orella as
city physicians.
Considerable electioneering was done in
the contest for positions on the adminis
tration committee. Sample ballots with
the names of R. Aguirre, P. Cames, -J.
Bergez, E. Semaine, E. Messager and H.
Fabregue canceled In pencil were circu
lated by those who sustained the old ad
mlnlstratjon committee in having ousted
Dr. O. J. ilayer from his position as sur
geon of the hospital. Considerable oppo
sition also developed against R. Chartrey,
vice-president, who had antagonized cer
tain interests:
The election began at 3 o'clock. The
members formed in line and were handed
pink tickets, the voting being done at
twelve booths erected on the stage. At

Contrary to Expectations the Election of Administration
Committee Is Very Orderly.
ber of delegates from each State was la
the early conventions not limited, though,
the number of votes was restricted to
the number of electors. The number of>
delegates from each State to Democrat la
conventions was for twenty years, from"
1852 fixed at double the number of elec
tors, and each delegate was given half,
a vote. A change in this rule was made*
in 1572, giving each delegate a whole vote.
while the number of .delegates remained
double that of the electors. The Repub
licans adopted this latter- rule twelve
years earlier, and it is still In force Irr
both parties. Two delegates from each
Territory are admitted to Republican'
conventions, with the privilege of voting.
This is designed to develop party feel

votes to Territorial delegates. M[
The Two-Thirds Sole and tha Major

The first Democratic convention adopted
a rule declaring "that two-thirds the

shall be necessary to constitute a choice."
This rule has been reaffirmed (against
strong opposition In 1535) by every sub
sequent Democratic convention. "Whig
and Republican conventions require a ma

adopted by the Whig convention of 1340.;

WARNER'S REIHEDIES.*
THE SAir FRANCISCO CAI/L, MONDAY, MARCH 26, 1900.
CHINESE WANT BONES OF
THEIR DEAD SENT HOME
Threatened Bevolt of Laborers En
gaged for the* Alaska Oanner
ies Is Averted.
"What threatened to prove a carious
disagreement between the three thousand
Chinese- who are employed In the-Alas
kan canneries during the summer months
and the commercial companies was amic
ably adjusted at a meeting of -the Six
Companies last night; and an impending
slrike of the heathen laborers was avert
ed.
The Chinese â¢lairrfed that for a num
ber of years they have been obliged to
bury their dead at the place where death
occurs, and in many instances the bodies
of Chinese are weighted and sunk in the
sea. Before the Chinese would depart
this year they Insisted that a specifica
tion be placed in each contract^ to the ef
fect that should any deaths occur while
the Chinese are out of the State the bones
of the dead shall be shipped to China at
the expense of the commercial companies.
As many of the Chinese were to sail to
day for "the North the sudden revolt ap
peared for a time serious. The f commer
cial bodies employing the Chines* re
fused to accede to all the demands, and
at the meeting last night the Six Com
panies agreed to make up any monetary
deficiencies that might exist, in order
that peace should reign.
The highbinder situation is still serious.
The Hou Sing Tongr are determined to
prosecute the Suey Sing highbinders now
under arrest, and to spill some blood in
revenge for the recent murders of mem
bers of their tong.
A large number of the men who are to
leave for Alaska to-day are members of
the Suey Sing Tong. and their absence
may seriously cripple the society.

BRAIN FOOD
Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is Di-
gested.
Xearly every one will admit that as a
nation we eat too much meat and too lit-
tle of vegetables and grains.
For business men, office men and clerks,
and in fact every one engaged In seden-
tary or Indoor occupations, grains, milk
and vegetables are much more healthful.
Only men engaged in severe outdoor
manual labor can live on a heavy meat
diet and continue in health.
As a general rule, meat once a day Is
sufficient for all classes of men, women
and children, and grains, fruit and vege-
tables should constitute the bulk of food
eaten.
But many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion, and it is of no
use to advise brain workers to eat largely
of grains and vegetables where the diges-
tion Is too weak to assimilate them prop-
erly.
It Is always best to get the best results
from our food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meals to assist the relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years' experience have
proven Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to
bo a very safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive and a remedy which may be taken
daily with the best results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hardly
be called a patent medicine, as they do
not act on the bowels nor any particular
organ, but only on the food eaten. They
supply what weak etomachs lack, pepsin
diastase, and by stimulating the gastric
glands Increase the natural secretion of
hydrochloris add.
People who make a dally practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal are sure to have
perfect digestion, which means perfect
health.
There Is no danger of forming an in-
jurious habit as the tablets contain ab-
solutely nothing but natural digestives;
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
no place In the stomach medicine, and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are certainly
the best known and most popular of all
stomach remedies. - ,-
Ask your druggist for a flfty-cent pack-
ace of Stuart's Dyspepsia* Tablets, and
after a week's use note the Improvement
In health, appetite and nervous energy.

BEACON WINS THE STAKE AT UNION
PARK AND PEPITA AT INGLESIDE
Representative of the Lopez'
Kennels Shows High- .
Class Form.
RE. de B. Lopez & Son's Paplta won
first money in the non-winners*
ftake yesterday at Ingleslde
Coursing Park, with Joe Perry's
I Commodore Nash as runner .up.
The ghort-ends made a great
showing, and the talent suffered severely.
In five courses Commodore Nash got
the flag, winning each time on merit and
In every case the wise ones had the dope
figured wrong, placing the Commodore
on the short end. The dog was beaten
out In the final by Papita. Nash led to
near the hare and then slowed down. Pa
pita took the turn, placing Nash for one
turn, when she drove by him, taking the
turn and kill. One Spot showed well all
day, winning twice on the short end In
good shape, a favorite in the third tie and
beaten by the stake winner in the fourth.
Kid McCoy, considered the fastest dog
in the stake, seemed too keen and lost his
chances by wild running In the second
tie. Little Fullerton and Rocker showed
well and for a while both looked like can
didates for the final. In the second tie
the short ends came In a bunch, favor
ites losing six of the first seven courses.
The hares were fast and strong enough to
make good tests. Following are the day's
results with Judge P. J. Rellly's official

Curtis & Son's Blue Grey
hound Has Great Speed
Possibilities.
PURTIS & SON'S blue greyhound
Beacon went through the open stake
Lat Union Coursing Park yesterday
in flying style. He led all his oppo
nents some five lengths to the hare.
Among the flyers to go out before
him were Lucretla Borgia, Miss Grizzle,
Random Aim, Royal Flush, 'Whitehead
and. In the deciding course, Brutus. In
the latter course Brutus became unsight
ed after leaving the slips. If anything,
this proved to be to his advantage as the
hare bent s^harply to him. He did not
show . sufficient speed to withstand the
flyer from the Garden City, as Beacon,
putting on all speed, passed him out for
the turn, and after that never let him
score, defeating him five points to noth
ing. .
There were many surprises during the
day, -chief among them being the defeat
of Palo Alto by Master Clalr. The young
dog had been backed off the board by the
bettors in their eagerness to have a ticket
on him. He again showed great speed
leading up to me hare by four lengths.
As Is his habit he hesitated an instant be
fore driving in for the kill, and Master
Clalr, fast and clever, had him beaten al
most before the spectators realized what
had happened. - , ,
The most sensational course of the day
was an undecided one between Royal
Flush and McKinley. The. two big dogs
ran nose and nose to the hare, there be
ing little to . choose between them in
speed. At the second attempt the run-up
was equally close, but Flush was more
successful in working up the hare and
won easily. In the succeeding round Bea
con led Royal Flush, which Is showing the
effects of continuous coursing, Â¦by six
lengths. . "
Whltehead ran Into third place, scoring
two clever wins In his courses, with Mac's
Melody and Bad Boy, both of which ran
in their best form.
â¢ * In . the .first round ' a number of warm
favorites were retired. Cavalier, a 10 to 1
favorite, was defeated by Miss ' Grizzle
The Exile ran a brilliant course, defeating
Rona, a 6 to 1 favorite. Bad Boy defeated
Bohe at 3 to 1; Master Clalr beat Palo
Alto, 5 to 1, and Blackette beat Rollicking-
Airs, 4 to 1. . . " Â¦ ... ,--*Â¦
The puppy. stake waa won by Julius
Horn's Bona Fide after an " undecided
course with Grafter. In the previous
round she ran an 'undecided course with
Pennegrant. The two extra courses did
not seem to harm her, as she shut out

BECAUSE he refused to part with 25 cents, the body of Joseph Murphy, a
teamster, now lies on a slab- In the undertaking parlors of Carew & Eng
lish, and John de Bono, a florist, is held in the City Prison on a charge
of murder. Murphy died yesterday morning at St. Mary's Hospital after
lingering between life and death for two days as the result of- wounds
Inflicted by De Bono during a scuffle In F. G. Jaeger's flower store, 236 Sutter
street. ' Â¦ â¢
The quarrel which ended in the death of Murphy was an accident of hap
hazard fortune. He was at the time employed as a teamster by the American
Fish Company," and while In the pursuit of his duties - on . March 13 he stopped
his team In front of Jaeger's flower store. On the sidewalk were several palms
which came within reach of Murphy's horse and they began to disappear. Do
Bono discovered that his plants were being eaten up, so he rushed out of the
store to cut the* operation short.
The team was without a driver and in order to secure recompense for the
damage done, De Bono untied the reins and took them with him when he went
back to his work.
Murphy was not long In discovering his loss. Jumping on the seat with a
friend, he reached for the reins in vain. De Bono came out of the 'store at
this time and demanded 25 cents for his injured palms, promising to return. the
reins If that sum were paid. Murphy was inclined to conform to the florist's re
quest, but his friend advised him not to do so. At this stage both 'florist and
teamster gave vent to torrid tempers and a battle enyued. Â¦ 'â¢ â¢. - â¢
Flower pots, plants In boxes, roses, pinks, lilacs, violets, in bunches and loose,
were scattered about the store in anything but artistic profusion. . As De Bono
tells his story, he dodged one vase of flower*, and seeing his assailant approach-
Ing with a small pot ready for use. he dodged behind the counter, at the same
time picking up a big pair of shears. :Â¦ ,
The pQt whizzed by and then De Bono let fly the shears, which struck Murphy
over the left eye. Soon after De Bono walked out and threw the.reins back to
Murphy, who had bandaged his head while mounted on the box. Â¦ : /
Murphy did not attend to his wounds with any degree of care. They were
dressed soon after the accident, but it was not until last Friday that ho was tak
en to St. Maryts Hospital. His condition was so precarious that Dr. Theodore
Rethers was called in by the family. He found it necessary to trephine the skull,
but a, congestion of the brain had already shown Itself.
Murphy did not tell his story to any of hl.s family, who were in constant at
tendance at the hospital. Until they heard from the physician last night they
imagined that his death was due to heart disease, from which he suffered. Mur
phy was 30 years of age, and at the time of the accident resided at the Winches
ter House. As soon a.Â« the death was reported to the police a search was made
for De Bono, who was arrested in the afternoon by Sergeant Kills of the Har
bor police station.
JACK McGRATH, BANK ROBBER.
THE third man Implicated in the robbery, of the First National Bank of [
Seattle has succeeded in eluding tho vigilance of Detectives Ryan and (
ODea of the. southern district. but his liberty will be .
short-lived, as they know where he has gone and will soon have him be- (
hind the bars. They have been working steadily on the case, and ascertained Â¦
Saturday night that the accomplice in the bank Job of Robert Collins, now In <
"the tanks" at the City Prison, and Parker, arrested In Victoria, B. C, was Â¦
Jack McGrath. a well-known pickpocket, who is also believed to have been
with Collins when he stole the $515 from the store of Ferdinand Smith, the "
money broker. 316 Montgomery street.
Chief Sullivan was so satisfied that Ryan and ODea would have McGrath (
In their clutches before morning that he wired to Seattle to that effect, but the .
bird had flown. . . -' : {'~'-l <
The detectives and Policeman Harry O'Day kept watch on the house of -
McGrath's parents at 483 Ninth street all Saturday night in the hope that he (
would make his appearance. About 5 o'clock yesterday morning, as McGrath â¢
did not appear, they entered the house and searched it from top to bottom, <
but the crook could not be found. His sister admitted that he had been there -
and that he had $2500 with him. of which he gave her Â«00. She handed over
the $400 to the detectives, and it is now In the hands of the police property J
clerk. She was asked to call upon Chief Sullivan, and did so later.
It was learned from her that McGrath knew a woman in Phoenix. Ariz., to (
whom he was attached, and the presumption was that he had gone to her.
Chief Sullivan at once wired to the Chief of Police at Seattle informing him of (
the fact and advising him to communicate at once with the authorities at .
Phoenix. The Chief also sent to the Chief of Police at Phoenix a photograph (
of McGrath and the woman, so that he could be on the lookout for him. Me- .
Grath fled as soon as he learned of Collins' arrest. . <
The detectives also found the satchels that McGrath and Collins brought .
with them from Seattle in McGrath's room. In .Collins' satchel was the re- <
volver which he had with him when he robbed the bank. The detectives -
showed it to him in the prison and he admitted that it was the weapon that <
he threatened to use on the bank president. The detectives are still searching j
for Collins' share of .the spoils.
A dispatch was received from Seattle last night stating that James !<.
Parker, one of Collins' accomplices in the robbery of the First National Bank
of, that city.had arrived there from Victoria, B." C," where he was captured,
and lodged in Jail. Parker's Infatuation for a variety actress led to the dls- 1
covery of his whereabouts. He denies his guilt. ' . ' â¢

mWeinstock Lectures.
Colonel H. Weinstock delivered last
night a very # interesting lecture at 117
Turk street on'"Some Points on Which I
Cannot Agree With Socialism." In his
lecture he stated that the trusts were
not to be feared as they were never known
to be operated in a successful manner.
Some people were prejudiced against la
bor-saving devices, but that when a ma
chine was invented that lessened the
number of workers new avenues of work
were opened to the employe that had
been affected. In socialism, he claimed,
there was too much of personal interest
for the few and not enough of "one for all
and all for one." ; : -f /
DEEDS TO BIG
TREE GROVE TO
PASS THIS DAY
i
Deal Covering the Change in
Owners to Be Ended
in Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 25.
The deal Involving the purchase of the
famous Calaveras grove of big trees by
R. B. "Whlteslde, a lumberman of Duluth,
Minn., has not been fully closed, and Mr.
Whiteside will not be the owner of this
grove and the south grove, in Tuolumne
County, until to-morrow. The deeds to
the two groves have been placed in the
Union National Bank of this city, and
will be handed to the Minnesota timber
dealer when he pays over $100,000 in gold
coin, which Is the purchase price. ' The
owner of the groves Is J. L. Sperry of
Berkeley.
The transfer of title carries with it full
possession to 2360 acres in both groves of
what Mr. Whltesides declares is the most
wonderfully timbered country In the
world. He asserts that his purchase is a
bona fide transaction on his own account;
that he is the sole purchaser of the two
groves, and that . these tradts are only a
small portion of timber lands ln that lo
cality which he has already purchased or
on which he has secured options.
Mr. Whiteside exhibited maps to-day
at his apartments at the Hotel Metropole
to Indicate the extensive nature of his
holdings. ,In speaking of the big tree
groves purchase he said:
"If the people of California are under
the impression that I have bought these
groves simply on a speculation with the
United States Government, they are very
much mistaken. I have held an option
of purchase on the tracts for several
months, having secured it as the result of
a personal investigation of the timber.
'T had planned as soon as the deal was
completed to go ahead with my business
and get ready to take out timber. I had
partiesâ my brother and another manâ out
here six months ago looking over the
timber lands of the State for me. In that
way I have received favorable reports
upon a great deal of this- land. . In the
vicinity of the big tree groves are two
large tracts which I have purchased, one
from a Mr. Weston and the other through
the Union National Bank. This big tree
purchase was Incidental to my other buys,
and I proposed to handle this timber as I
will the other that covers my lands.
"Since the purchase was made it has
come to my knowledge that the Govern
ment may purchase or condemn the
groves to save them from being cut into
lumber. Well, I stand ready to part with
the tracts at a fair valuation. I do not
want to 'cinch' the Government, and I am
willing to meet it half way. Yam not
ready to name any specific amount. ?It
would not be business to do so at this
time. Suffice it to say that if my ideas
of the value of the property to me are
met the Government will not' have to
condemn any of the lands. I shall not
do anything at present to injure either the
Calaveras or the south grove.
"My other timber lands are mainly cov
ered with pines. Now the sugar pine of
California has got to take the place of
white pine ln the East. I am satisfied
that within eight or ten years the Eastern
white pine will all be cut out."
Mr. Whlteslde said the people of the
State could rest assured he would leave
the big trees intact, and that the Gov
ernment would be given ample opportun
ity to make the trade. The groves are
the only tracts of redwoods ln Mr. White
side's holdings in Calaveras and Tuolumne
counties.

IS CELEBRATED
AT ST. IGNATIUS
Calvarian Society Holds
Lenten Services at the
Cathedral.
The feast of the Annunciation of the
Most Blessed Virgin Mar)' was observed
yesterday by special services at St. Igna
tius Church. At the solemn high mass
at 10:30 a. m., the Eervices were very im
pressive. The celebrant was the Rev.
Vincent Testa, who was assisted by the
Rev. Richard Bell as deacon, the Rev.
Patrich Ityan sub-deacon, and the Rev.
iaiher Cuiiigan as master of ceremonies.
I here were over twenty-five acolytes in
attendance.
The nermon was preached by the Rev.
i atiier MaJaony and the subject of the
discourse was taken from the gospel of
the day. lie said the blessen Virgin was
epecialiy chosen as tne Mother of God on
account of her great humility. Humility
*'Â»s explained as truth. This was exem
pllned uÂ» the life of the blessed Virgin.
An appeal was made by the reverend fa
tner to his listeners to seek after the same
virtue of truth co that they all might live
more to the glory of God.
I here were special services ln the even-
Ing in commemoration of the opening of
the twentieth century. The sermon was
preached by the Rev. Henry Woods, the
celebrant being the Rev. J. P. Frieden. S.
J.. father euperior of the Jesuit order on

The Calvarian Society held special Len
ten service yesterday afternoon at St.
Mary's Cathedral. The service opened
Â¦with the devotion of the Stages of the
Cross. The Rev. Father McGough
preached the sermon. He said ln part:
"My dear brethren, let us follow to-day
the life of Caiapbas, the high priest. He
was the highest Jewish minister while
Christ was on earth. He had no business
In the oQce he held, as it was a position
that was banded down from father to con,
but he was placed in the exalted position
by the Romans. Calaphas was a cruel man
and can be blamed for the de-ath of our
Lord by his unmerciful prosecution. A
young man sprung up from Judea and he
came on earth to establish God's word on
earth. Gathering large crowds wherever
he went he was a dangerous man to the
Jewish religion. Calaphas, with other offi
cials, tried to establish evidence against
him. without success. He was at last
brought before the high priest and
charged with three different offence?
which they were unable to prove. Christ
was not allowed counsel or any chance of
defense. Calaphas was unable to condemn
J*^us to death himself, so he sent him to
Pilate and there appeared himself not as
& Judge but as a prosecutor."
At the close of the sermon the solemn
r>ened!ction was celebrated by the Rev.
Father Ranun.

flgTsifytnjr a flower. Is situated on one of tne
bills of Galilee, about twenty-three miles from
the Mediterranean Sea and sir miles from the
village of Cana, where thÂ« marriage feast was

As* Mary Is mother of God by reason of the
Incarnation, the faithful should pray to her
constantly; however. I am not to be under
stood as saying that ehe Is either goddess or a
divinity, but only God's most privileged crea
ture. In invoking her Intercession use the truÂ«
forms of prayer that are particularly conse
crated by the church, namely, the Holy Mary
and the Anrelus. In reciting these prayers
you will be. honorlnc the Blessed Vlrrin and
yon will be reminded cf the wonderful myttery
of the Incarnation, wherein God became man
that man might become God and enjoy the hap
piness of the anuels.

Divorce Suit Against Alan
Ward Has Not Yet Been
Settled.
I AIÂ»AMEDA, March 23.â 1n a few days
Alan Ward of 723 Paru street, former
leader in society and son of A. H. Ward,
the wealthy mining man, . proposes to
leave for Siberia, to be absent for an in
definite length of time. His destination
will be Irkutsk, the northermost and
coldest city of the Asiatic Continent.
There he will engage in mining in a dis
trict which is said to be immensely rich
In gold. The divorce suit which his wife
commenced against him and is still pend
ing may restrain him from carrying out
his intention just now. Though he has
allowed the action to go by default, the
little matter of alimony has not been set
tled, and that will have to be reckqned
before he can take his departure.
Young Ward was a favorite in society
and much sought after, until a hasty mar
riage, and divorce proceedings soon after
ward, achieved for him unpieasant no
toriety. On last Thanksgiving day Ward
and Miss Dicka. Cool, daughter of Dr.
George A. Cool of San Francisco, were
married with little ceremony at San Ra
fael. Before very long Mr. and Mrs. Ward
drifted apart. The humdrum of matri
mony became too oppressive for the gay
young husband and he began to frisk
about In his restlessness. Mrs. Ward ob
jected seriously to the attentions he was
paying to other women, and finally a
month ago commenced a suit for divorce
against him on the ground of infidelity.
He. was willing that she should have the
divorce and has allowed the action to
go by default, only seeking protection ln
the matter of alimony, which has not yet
been settled. -
GEORGE W. REED
CANDIDATE FOR
HIGH HONORS
Says He Is in the Fight to
Go to the Republican
National Convention.
- . â¢ Â¦ Â¦' - . - - â¢ .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 25.
George W. Reed Is absolutely Â¦In Â¦Â¦. the
fight against Dr. Geor&e C. Pardee for
delegate-at-large to the National Repub
lican Convention, and he is going to con
test with Dr. Pardee for tne delegation
from this county. Alameda County will
probably be allowed one of the delegates
at-large, and the man that can take the
Alameda County delegation to the State
convention will be accorded that honor.
Mr. Reed returned to Oakland to-day and
positively declared his candidacy,- which
was announced by proxy yesterday.
Â¦ "I am a candidate for* delegate-at-large
to the Republican National j Convention,"
said Mr. Reed to-day. "I am in the fight
absolutely and to stay, without reference
to any one else who may be a candidate.
To be a delegate-at-large to the Republi
can National Convention is an honor to
which any one who has been a consistent
Republican from his boyhood up has the
the right to nspire. It is an honor with
which come no emoluments, and for that
reason a man Â¦who haa always been loyal
to the party has a right to seek it. My
candidacy means simply that I would like
to go to the National Convention if the
Republicans of this county want me to go.
It nas no reference to the Congressional,
fight or any individualâ it is simply a de
sire tn represent the party that I have so
long served in one of their national con
ventions. My service to the party ln all
of its branches is too well known to need
elaboration, and there can be no question
about'my Republicanism."
This means a flat fight against Dr. Par
dee. It is a fight for the control of the
county and it means that there are warm
times In prospect for the Republicans of
the banner Republican county of the
State.
Dr. George C. Pardee is very non-com
mittal over the candidacy of Mr. Reed,
and still more non-committal over his own
candidacy. While Dr. Pardee has been re
garded as a candidate for that position,
and while he has been announced in sev
eral papers as such a candidate, the doc
tor himself is not ready to make the an
nouncement.
"I don't know anything about Mr.
Reed's candidacy for delegate-at-large to
the Republican convention?' said Dr. Par
dee this afternoon. "I presume that he has
a right to be a candidate if he wishes to."
"Have you officially announced your
candidacy?"
"I have not yet said that I was going
to be a candidate," replied the doctor.
But despite this uncertain position Â¦ of
Dr. Pardee his candidacy has been regard
ed as certain by the politicians of Oak
land, and the announcement of Mr. Reed's
candidacy is regarded as a direct assault
upon Dr. Pardee's position ! ln Alameda
County. If It comes to a direct contest at
the polls it will be the biggest fight for
an honorary position that ever took place
in the county.

NO HELL WANTED,
SAYS B. FAY MILLS
Unitarian Preacher Tells of Causes
That Influenced Him to Become
a Liberal in Religion.
"Why I became a Liberal ln Religion,"
was the topic of Benjamin Fay Mills' lec
ture last night at the Metropolitan Tem
ple. The speaker of the evening waa In
troduced to the audience by ; the Hon.
James O. Maguire. Mills prefaced his re
marks by saying that the topic was not
of his own selection, but .that he had re
peatedly been requested. to give his ex
perience in reference to solving the fun
damental doctrines . of religion, and that
he would relate them to the audience. .
"I think a man should Â¦ choose his own
religion," he said. "A man can be gauged
in his religion by his intellect. I cannot
see what you see, and you cannot see
what I see. I have had a splendid oppor
tunity to observe all the churches in
America and I have come to the conclu
sion that there Is too much social life
ln the churches and not enough of Christ.
I have also found out that there are Just
,as good people that do not - attend
churches as those that go.
"I attended a lecture once given â¢ by
Henry Ward Beecher on the subject of
eternal torture, and : after attending ~ I
thought considerably on the subject and
came to - the conclusion that It does not
sound feasible for the rood and kind God
to have made such a place- for his chil
dren. I see no use for any - hell, as men
are jetting better every day. and are cen
tury after century becoming Â¦ more : en
lightened. It cannot be possible that after
Adam and his wife Eve had partaken of
the forbidden fruit under the romantic
tree that death should be the punishment
for us all. Man Is becoming more perfect
every day. We have proof of that, taking
for one example the colony of Australia,,
where there were convicts years ago, and
their sons and daughters have become as
enlightened and as progressive aa any
race in the world to-day. '.'. , Â¦

PULPIT LOSING ITS
HOLD ON THE PUBLIC
Bey. Dr. E* C. Foute Names Causes
Leading to the Spread of
Atheism.
Taking as his theme "The Importance of
Christian Example." Key. Dr. R. C. Foute
cave utterance to a few Individual senti
ments at Grace Episcopal Church last
evening which cannot fail to excite wide
discussion among both clergy and laity.
In the opinion of the preacher there is
entirely too much talking- done from the
pulpit, which has "almost lost its influ
ence on the masses," while the example
set by many co-called Christians is so
â¢widely at variance with the precepts
taught by the Savior that many honest
observers have been driven Into atheism.
"There hae been ro much empty talk
from the pulpit," said Dr. Foute, "that It
haÂ» almost lost Its influence with the
masses. The acts of Christians generally
constitute the latter-day Bible, and many
people read no other. Be earnest ln your
Endeavors to be faithful disciples of the
master, for the eyes of tne world are upon
you. Every flip Is noticed and weighs
against us.

WIZARD OF THE PIANO
HERE ON SECOND VISIT
Paderewski, Looking Much the Same
as Before, Comes to Charm '-*'>'
San Franciscans.
Paderewski, looking much the same,
hair and all, as he did when he was here
four years ago, arrived in this city yester
day morning ln his private car "Rlva,"
with six attendants. After spending the
afternoon in his regular practice on the
piano, which is his Inseparable compan
ion, he was driven last evening to the
Palace Hotel, where his manager, Hugo
Gorlltz, had secured apartments earlier in
the day. ' -
The "Wizard of the Keys" comes from
the City of Mexico, where he electrified
large audiences with his admirable tech
nique. He also played in Los Angeles and
San Diego, with success, and no' doubt
will duplicate the furor he created in this
city on the occasion of his last appear
ance. . Â¦
The pianist had a series of mishaps dur
ing his present tour, which began Decem
ber 12 last, and though he was subjected
to considerable inconvenience at the time
he enjoys recounting them now with evi
dent relish. In Galveston, Texas, one ots
the grand pianos which travel with him
was irreparably ruined through the stu
pidity of the baggage hands. It seems
the case was too large to admit its en
trance in the freight car, so it was taken
off and the piano was put in by itself and
was co knocked about that Paderewski
was obliged to order another one in its
place.
When seen at the hotel last night Pade
rewski pleaded fatigue after his Journey.
He expressed himself, however, as being
delighted to be in San Francisco once
more, his last visit having been such a
pleasant one.
"I desire to correct the impression,"
said Paderewski, "to the effect 1 that I
have taken on weight. .That story aug
mented in New York, - where a reporter
who interviewed me asked, me how I felt.
I replied that I was never better in my
life and said, 'Don't I look robust?" And
a story appeared next day stating that I
weighed 100 pounds more than I did for
merly. I am delighted to say that my
weight Is Just three and a half pounds
more than when I waa here last."

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
CELEBRATE THEIR
SILVER ANNIVERSARY
Sir. and Mrs. Sigxnund Begensburger
Receive the Congratulations of
Their Many Friends.
Slgmund and Mrs. Regensburger of 1306
Ellis street celebrated the silver anniver
sary of their wedding yesterday after
noon and evening at their home. During
the afternoon a large number of friends
called at the house to congratulate the
couple who for a quarter of a century
have journeyed together through life,
during which time they have been blessed
with three children â two sons and a
daughter. The majority of those who
called brought as tokens of their sincere
friendship presents of silverware, to serve
ln after years as reminders of tne pleas
ant occasion.
In the afternoon the members of Colum
bia Lodge, Independent Order of B'nal
B'rith, of which Mr. Regensburger is a
past president, called at the house in a
body. President G. Nathan, on behalf of
the lodge, in an eloquent address, pre
sented the bride and groom of twenty
five years with a case containing a solid
silver table service.
Later in the day the membership of
Bay City Lodge, Independent Order of
Odd Fellows, of which Mr. Regensburger
has twice been noble grand, called and,
through Treasurer Albert Steiner. pre
sented its congratulations and a large,
heavy silver punch ladle appropriately in
scribed. In addition to these presents
were a number of beautiful floral pieces
and the happy couple received many con
gratulatory telegrams from New Mexico,
the East and various parts of the State.
In the yard at the rear of the house there

of young folks, who .danced and made
merry in the parlors, and after the dance

COMMERCIAL BODIES
WILL TAKE ACTION
San Francisco Business Men Desire to
Correct False Beports of
Bubonic Plague.
The harmful effect of the bubonic
plague scare Epread throughout the coun
try by our Board of Health has made it
self manifest to San Francisco shipping,
and as a result the NornÂ« travel which
this city foughi. so hard for Is in a fair
way of being driven to the Puget Sound
cities. A number of shipowners of this
city had, before the scare, held off on
charters, with the intention of having
their vessels carry passengers from this
port to the northern goldfields. depending
on passengers mostly on the influx from
the Eastern States.
The sensational reports that San Fran
cisco was infected with the plague, pub
lished througnout the East, have done
much to scare the would-be prospectors,
and in consequence the tide of travel has
turned, the Kasterners avoiding California
and wending t~eir way to other shipping
points, to our financial loss.
Unless thÂ«? false reports regarding the
health conditions of this city are soon cor
rected it is the Intention of those shipown
ers whose interests are being thus de
stroyed to send their vessels to the Sound
ports to catch the trade driven from San
Francisco by the nefarious work Of, a
band of scheming politicians.
The commercial bodies of this city will
meet to-day to take action in an endeavor
to set right the wrong that has been so
shamefully done to San Francisco and Its
commerce. The Kxaminer's yellow part
ner, the i<ew York Journal, in its anxiety
to give the trade of this city a setback,
has overreached itself, and its lying state
ments show to what extreme its owner
will go to serve his own ends.
CHINESE BEATEN.
New Tactics Employed by the Health
Board in Its Purifying Process.
The farce which has been recently
placed on the bills in Chinatown by the
Board of Health is developing into trage
dy. A complaint was made last night that
not only is property destroyed, commerce
stunted and inoffensive citizens menaced,
but that brute force is being used to in
flict personal Injury upon those with
whom the health officers come in contact.
Phelan's taxeaters, regardless of the
Sabbath, continued thfir little game yes
terday. Into their hearts seems to be In
stilled the old Chinese adage of "walk-
Ing in trodden paths," and the same
ground that was gone over on the first
day the mob of inspectors set out on their
rounds continues to receive their visits.
The same doors have been smashed in.
the same cobblestones polished with
chloride of lime and the same walls
smeared with whitewash. Xo thought is
given to the police officers who are obliged
to tow the officials from house to house,
and some of the squads serve from 9
o'clock ln the morning until midnight.
Yesterday a Chinese named Sum Woey,
one of the lessees of a building on Du
pont and Pacific streets, complained that
he had been severely beaten by some of
the inspectors without any provocation.
The man said he was called upon to open
the door of the building, and while at
tempting to do po was knocked down and
brutally beaten. A broken nose Is evi
dence of the severity of the treatment ac
corded him. He Â¦was also booked for bat
tery and vulgar language after he had
been returned from the hospital. Sum
Woey has employed an attorney and will
file charges in a couple of days.

CHAMPION JEFFRIES
BOXES AT THE CHUTES
Puts His Brother Through, the Hopes.
At the Park, Beach and
Sutro Baths.
It was a quiet day. yesterday at all of
the city's pleasure places excepting the
Chutes. The announcement that Cham-
pion James :J. Jeffries | would , appear ln
the ring In a three-round contest with his
brother Jack attracted over 10 ,0W people
to the Chutea. The women took a special
Interest ln the event, as it is not often that
they can witness a fight without making
some sacrifice, and they took advantage
of the opportunity. Jeffries and his bro
ther boxed on a platform erected over the
lake, near â¢the electric fountain. Billy
Jordan was master of ceremonies and in
troduced the champion and his opponent.
Jeffries was well received, and after smil
ing at his admirers went to work. The
first and second rounds were without spe
cial Â¦ interest." The champion showed his
usual strength and hitting powers and
seemed -.to be abandoning his crouching
method of fighting which has occasioned
so much comment. His brother made a
good stand against his rushes, but is
plainly outclassed. The third and last
round ended with considerable excite
ment.. The boxers had been sparring for
some seconds when Â¦ Jim saw an opening
and landed a crushing blow. Jack sailed
through the ropes of the arena, struck
the narrow platform, rolled off and fell
five feet on to the edge of the electric
fountain. -He Immediately Jumped up and
assured" his brother that he was unin
jured and together they returned to the
dressing room. The 'onlookers indulged
in the usual "autopsy" of the event, after
which they enjoyed the mrlous attrac
tions. The three Cherry sisters will be
the attraction at the Chutes thl3 week. Â¦
The unpleasant weather kept the
crowds away from the park and beach.
But few vehicles were on the road near
the Cliff House. Notwithstanding the
weather there were many people who
passed .the Sabbath splashing around the
tank? at Sutro Baths or enjoying the
aquatic contests. The results of the con
tests follow: â¢

was not the object of Mr. Tobin and his
friends to make a Sunday school out of
Ban Francisco, but to make it hard to rob
the unsuspecting and the unwary. He be

Every one knows that the gambling of this
town Is of the "sun-thing" variety, and that a
voi? against tfai rÂ» tolution is an indorsement
of "dead tame" gambling. As to the ordi
nance being too sweeping, breaking up all
t>port, etc., if any of these gentlemen know of
tt square game in this town let them make an
exception. The plea of broadness - and liber
ality la a very taking one, but good men can
not afford to mistake it for license. They know
that to sustain the present sporting system
ts It la represented by its own votaries is . the
narrowest kind of narrowness and the greatest
violation of liberality. Why talk of liberality
Jor thieves and cutthroats when the unwary
and innocent must suffer? Why sustain a sys
tem that sends annually half a hundred and
more to penal Institutions? The Supervisors
have It In their power to lift this city' in the
Â«t!mation of the whole civilized world. I am
concerned for a better and safer condition for
those who suffer. Let the laws protect them
fend not the wrongdoers. I am concerned for
the honor of this city, its Mayor and Board of
**iIÂ»T-rlÃorB, whom I helped to elect. I . was
told by eotne that I was making a fire for my
Â»<-lf. They will prove or disprove that charge

CHANGES IN THE
POLICE FORCE
ON THE TAPIS
Pension Board Will Meet
This Afternoon to Dis
cuss Matters.
Speculation as to Who -Will Succeed
Captain Bohen as Chief of Be- -
tectivesâ Esola on the
"Slate,"
The new Police Commissioners will meet
this afternoon for the first time as a Pen
sion Board. The meeting will be an in
formal one, but important matffers will be
discussed, so that when the regular quar
terly meeting jls held - next- Monday the
' Commissioners "will- be prepared to rush
through the business. Â¦&&&,
It is no 'secret that several-, of the old
bar. <ss will be retired to,, give place to
younger and more energetic men; and
among them are Captain Bohen of the
detective department. Captain Dunlevy of
the harbor district and several sergeants
and others who are eligible for retirement
even with the Increased age limit of 65
years, as required by the charter.
Three names have' been prominently
mentioned for the position of chief, of.de-.
tecUves, which carries a salary of $3000
per year. They are Captain Seymour,
J_>ete-ctive Robert . Hogan and â¢, Captain
Wittman. As between the two captains,'
Seymour's chances are considered the
more favorable owing to his years of
training and experience under Lees and
his admirable record. But Detective Ho-:
pan's friends say that his chances are
good, and thoee who know him appreciate
the fact that he Is sufficiently capable to
Sill the responsible office with ability and
Intelligence. - . Â¦.
If Captain Seymour should be promoted
It Is considered certain that Lieutenant
Eeola will be made a captain and as
signed to the City Prison. If Hogan
Fhould be appointed chief of detectives
Ksola will get his captaincy anyhow and
l>e assigned to the harbor district, vice
Dunlevy. retired. Esola Is on the "slate"
to be made a captain to placate his
friends. This surmise is strengthened by
the remark of President Newhall when
Ksola's letter of withdrawal from his can
didacy for Chief of Police was read at the
meeting of the board. , -V - :
The applications of ex-Commissioners
Tobin and Alvord for pensions will also
form a fruitful theme for discussion. The
Commissioners have received written pro
tests from citizens against the applica
tions being favorably entertained, as it is
pointed out that the petitioners were not
members of the Police Department ac
cording to the McCoppin act: that they
did not contribute one cent to the pension
fund, which is compulsory upon all mem
bers of the department, and that they
received their appointments from the
Governor of the fatate, and not from the
ilayor of the city.
It Is understood that coincident with the
retirements by the Pension Board, Chief
Bulllvan will Issue his order No. 3, mak
ing important changes in the personnel
of the "upper office.". The report, has
been current for some time that several
detectives will be relegated to the ranks,
und men who have been doing special
duty and others in the ranks will take
their places. The issuance of the order is
looked forward to with much trepidation
by those concerned.

ABSCONDER GRIMMEL
ADMITS HIS GUILT
Confesses in the Broad-way Jail,
Where He Was Placed by the
Federal Authorities.
Edward K. Grlmmel, who absconded
from this city Jast December with a num
ber of checks belonging to the United
States medical disbursing department, and
who was recently captured In Philadel
phia, was returned to the scene of his
crime last night and placed In the Broad
way Jail.
Grlmmel, who was a civilian clerk In
the medical department, took a check
book containing 400 checks and during the
month of January drew checks payable
to himself to an amount approximating
110.000. He operated in the East and
South, and represented that he was pur
chasing agent for the Government.
When seen last night Grimmel admitted
his guilt, and said he gave the officers a
chase before they landed him. He visited
most of the States and operated wherever
he could. *: . ;:

Perhaps to-day, or maybe to-morrow,
CoIUs P. Huntington will slip Into town
on his special train, and the first any one
will know of his presence will be from the
lights flashing through the long-darkened
windows of the California-street residence.'
He always comes that way, and he will
not depart from his usual custom. A few
trusted retainers will be in the secret and
will meet him at the boat, or; It may.be
at Sixteenth street, .Oakland, so that he
will ' get the .news properly colored from
the start off, but ; there will . be no cheers
nor handshaking nor noticeable gathering
of officials. . > \
?; As "on, every Â¦ previous, occasion ; of the
Southern | Pacific president's visit, rumors
of. probable effects are rife in railroad cir
cles. Â¦ There is a great deal doing Just now,
and the old railroader Is not- going to -let
anything pass without having something
to do with it. The coming election of di
rectors is, of course, the principal business
in 1 view,- for the -results ;of all the wire
pulling and coonublating will show there.'
The last ' vestige ' of the â¢ Stanford and
Crocker interests will ' vanish ' with : this
meeting, and Jluntington Â¦ will have su
preme control.' .Who he will have In the
board .to represent' him is the interesting
question under discussion; Â¦ Â¦
The relief fund -business is not yet dead,
either, and there Is some fine work for the
old -man 'tot do there,- too. Â¦ The employes
of the road are not yet willing to give up
their legal rights, and how to make them
do so. with a glad heart and a blithe mien
is also up to the chief. â¢ V
There Is a. cloud Inthe direction of the
telegraphers as . well. -:: For - nearly ; three
weeks the board of control of .the Order
of Railway Telegraphers has been in quiet
session in this city discussing grievances
and how to mend Â¦. them. ; They i wish: to
have established ; a system by which â¢ the
rights of the older operators will be recog
nized. -As If is now,: length of service; is
no guarantee that a man will advance pro
vided a younger : man Â¦ has i friends i In . the
inner office.;: Time. and' again' the old op
erators â¢ have Â¦ seen â¢ favorites . passed over
their heads to higher positions and higher
salaries, and they arc beginning to think
something ought to be done. ; Some sort of
a satisfactory system has been put in op
eration in , the East. ; and : an : attempt will
be made to put something of the kind jn
operation here. ; Huntington : wiir have
something to say about that, too. :
I The Impending competition of the Santa

a field 'for: the 'chief's 'scheming, > and the
fact that on. his .way .out 1 here the presi

a run over there to look at the harbor he
didn't get, but hopes to secure some day,"
that is all.; But it is probable some work
will , be done on ; that Â¦Â¦ question - too I before
the magnate goes Â¦ back ; East. .>

commission is still unserved and

else has rusted its seal off. It. will be re

benefit. It became Inquisitive and the pres

York and then go East to look out for it
He was in contempt of tho commission,
but it seemed not to, be the kind of con
tempt that common people indulge In,, for
he has been back once since then and no
one has heard of the outraged t feelings
oT the commission. They will probably
not be paraded this time either.
.Another rumor, Interesting as any of
the others, says Huntington will this time
arrange for a permanent residence In Cal
ifornia. But on that subject he has said
nothing so far. Â¦
The yellow building Is all agog over pos
sible changes, not the. least of whichT as
was announced in The Call,' will, be the
appointment of, a new man to.the posi
tion now held by William F. Herrin. The
prospect of more trade with the Orient is
another question the president will be
called upon to handle, and altogether his
visit should be a momentous one, unless
he decides to quit work and go East again
just after the meeting of the board.

FIRST BA PTIST CHURCH
SOLEMNLY REDEDICATED
Impressive Services In the Recon
structed Edifice Which Was
. Partly Destroyed by. Fire.
The reconstructed First Baptist Church
was yesterday solemnly consecrated to
the service of God with prayer and song.
Not a vacant chair nor an inch of stand
ing room was to be had when the morn
ing services began. It was an important
occasion to the congregation, as it was
the . first time services nad been held in
the church since it was partially de
stroyed by fire In October fast. Fortun
ately the fire was confined to the upper
portion of the structure, and it was pos
sible to roof over the lower story with
dome and skylight, so, that the edifice is
now more comtor table and .commodious
than before."
The services opened with the singing of
the Doxology. after which the .Lord's
prayer was recited. The choir I then ren
dered the > anthem, "Praise Â¦ the Lord, O
My : Soul," after which there .was i respon
sive reading of Psalms 98 and 100. â¢ The
"Gloria" was sung, followed by the report
of the board of trustees, in which the
chairman told of the present standing of
the church. He was pleased to state that
the . church was rededicated Â¦ free from
debt, so that the usual collection was un
necessary. : :
Rev. E. A. Woods, pastor of the church,
then preached - the dedicatory sermon
from the words In II Chronicles, 7:1: "The
glory of -the Â¦ Lord filled the ; house." . In
part he said:
' At i the dedication of the temple the sacrifices
were placed upon . the altar . and as Solomon
closed . his prayer the : fire came down from
heaven and consumed * the * offerings and ' the
glory of the Lord filled the house. Â¦ The scene
was Impressive and inspiring." r . ,

fact that ' worship lis an instinct of tho human

William Zingg of Alameda, whom Miles
claims was in league with Leet to get pos
session of Lowry s money, makes the fol
lowing statement:
Lowry and I never had any business rela
tions whatever. While I yas running a shoot
lnKKalleryin Portland. Or., In 1389, we be
came acquainted. While Lowry appeared to
have plenty of money, I never saw him spend
much of it, and he always complained of, his
poverty. I I conducted the shootlnr srallery at
Portland for six months, at the end of which
time I returned to Alameda and started a cigar
store. I did not meet Lowry again for at least
six years. Then about a year ago we met In
Ban Francisco and I Invited him to come and
see me, which he did several times. He was in
my â¢ store about two weeks ago, but only
dropped In to pass. the time of day.
F. J. Leet was employed by me when I was
running the shooting gallery .In Portland.
When I left Portland .he started an
other gallery, . but he ' j gave that up
and when . he . came back â¢to Â¦ Alameda
I gave him employment by sending him to Va
llejo to run a . shooting gallery there. . He
fleeced me out of some money and I discharged
him. , I haven't seen him for five years.- wÂ«
don't speak as we pass by. I understood that
he was also engaged in the aluminum plate
glass letter business, but whether or not he
was associated with Lowry I don't know.
by these names and his familiarity with
the handwriting of the deceased that
Miles was enabled to clear up the mys
tery surrounding the suicide. In addi
tion Lowry sent a letter to Miles which
the latter received the day after the sui
cide, and in which Lowry said:
V_ THURSDAY. March Â».
Dear Tom: It cannot be helped. I drank too
much on account of love for. my dear sister,
Dossie, and the only girl I ever loved, Maud.
"Lowry was an 'Englishman," said
Miles, "who has been knocking about In
this â¢ country for several years. 'Dossle,'
mentioned in his letter, is his half -sister,
who resides at Carlisle, England. A few
days ago she sent him $200. expressing the
hope that It would assist him in starting
in business for himself. He f 6ll in with
a man named Leet, who undertook to
sell him a half-interest in a shooting gal
lery contrivance known as 'The Soldier's
Dream,' and belonging to "William Zingg
of Alameda. After he, had paid his money
he found that he had 'been led into a bad
bargain and had practically lost " all his
sister had sent him. He became very de
spondent In consequence and told ,me
Thursday that he had made up his mind
to jump into the bay."
THE young man who committed "sui
cide Friday afternoon by jumping
into the bay from the ferry boat
Oakland, displaying a pistol to keep
back several men who sought to
pre\-ent him from carrying his in
tentions Into execution, has been identi
fied as "Jack" Lowry, who worked for
Cook Brothers, decorators, on Sutter
street. It is claimed that he killed him
self because he lost all he possessed in
a Questionable transaction with some
contrivance known as "The Soldier's
Dream."
The Identity of the suicide was disclosed
by Thomas E. Miles, who- operates a pat
ent printing machine on Grant avenue,
and who claims to have been a lifelong
friend of Lowry. According to his state
ment Lowry showed him a card Thursday
afternoon on which he had written his
message of farewell to the world.
The letter which was found In Lowry'B
hat after he Jumped overboard makes
mention of "Dossle" and Maud, and it was

AGED RESTAURANT
KEEPER BEATEN
BY TWO THUGS
Enter His Place of Business
While He Is Alone and
-Try to Rob Him.
After Taking His "Wallet They
Throw It Away So as to Avoid
Being Arrested-â Police on
v" Their Trail.
One. of the boldest robberies reported to
the police : for: some time was ' committed
late Friday night in a restaurant owned
by Thomas Healy at 148 Fifth street. That
the thugs did not succeed In carrying out
their purpose was due to the screams of
the restaurant proprietor, who was the
victim.- Â¦ .
Healy Is a very old man and Â¦is emaci
ated from sickness. Shortly before mid
night . Friday an " evil looking young man
entered; the restaurant and called for a
cup of coffee. .' Healy was alone at the
time and had just - hnished counting the
cash preparatory to closing his place of
business tor the night when the stranger
appeared. After being served with the
conee the stranger asked Healy to show
him to the rear. Not suspecting anything
wrong, the old man led him to the kitch
en anu then opened the rear door leading
to an . alley off . . Natoma street. As he
reached the alley Healy was attacked by
another man, who was lying in | wait for
him, and dealt a stunning blow In the
face. * - .
As ha staggered against the door the
thug caught mm by the throat and threat
ened to strangle him if he made an outcry.
The young man whom he had escorted to
the alley then searched the helpless vic
tim, taking a wallet containing $110 and
some valuable papers from an Inside vest
pocket. Seeing his earnings disappear in
the robber's pocket Healy, despite his old
age, bravely resolved to recover the
money or die in the attempt. Summoning
all his strength he succeeded in freeing
himself from the grip of the thug who
held him by the throat, and seizing the
robber who relieved him of his precious
wallet he attempted to forcibly regain
possession of it.
While he was struggling with the fel
low the second robber dealt him a terrific
blow on the side of the head,* almost tak
ing him 'off his feet. Realizing that the
men would not hesitate to kill him, Uealy
shouted at the top of his voice for help.
A citizen who was walking along Natoma
street heard his screams and hastened to
his rescue. Becoming alarmed for their
own safety, the pair left their victim and,
running, through the restaurant, made
their escape.
. Healy was almost exhausted when dis
covered by the citizen who was attracted
to the scene by his cries. He briefly told
the story of the struggle with the thugs
and the loss of his wallet. The citizen
lost no : : time in finding ' two - policemen,
who searched for . the' thugs, but in vain.
After giving a description of the men to
the omcers Â¦ the citizen â¢ returned .to > the
restaurant and assisted | Healy . in . locking
up â¢ the place. Before leaving Healy,
thinking that the robbers might have
dropped the wallet In their anxiety to es
cape, procured a light and searched the
alley. To his intense surprise, he found
the - wallet intact lying on the ground a
few feet away from Â¦ the i scene of the
struggle. The next morning Healy visited
police headquarters and I told Chief Sulli
van of .the robbery. The latter immedi
ately detailed two of his best men on the
case, but thus far they have been unable
to locate, the robbers.
