SAN iFRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1900.
LONDON, March 6. â Mafe
king is to be relieved. It
is interesting to note that
a movement is in progress from
Kimberley. A strong force, in
cluding the Canadian Mounted
Infantry, a portion of the artil
lery and the Kimberley Light
Horse, which has commenced to
march northward and expects to
find opposition at Fourteen
Streams, where the railway
bridge has been wrecked across
the Vaal River, and push onward
up the line, can have one object
only. There are doubtless scat
tered commandos of Boers who
used to be at Spytfontein and
around the diamond city in this
direction, but the ultimate reason
for the expedition is without
doubt the relief of Mafeking by
active co-operation with Colonel
Plumer.
It is not to be expected that
any stirring news will be re
ceived from" Lord Roberts' army
for a few days to come. So far
as can be judged, the situation in
the neighborhood of Modder
River is unchanged, the British
camp being still at Osfontein, a
few miles southeast of Paarde
berg, and the Boers occupying, a
position extending about eight
een miles. It may be assumed, as
the Boer left rests on some kopjes
not far from Osfontein and their
right on the river, and this army, :
roughly estimated at from 4000

to 5000, extends in some sort of
thin formation as far as Abrahams
Kraal, about seventeen miles
east of â¢ Koodoosfand, they.can
hardly have any serious intention
of disputing Roberts' advance,
for their numbers are not suffi
cient for such a purpose, but they
obviously hope to delay matters
and give time for Joubert to col
lect his forces from Northern Na
tal and elsewhere to make a stand
either at Brandfonfor Winburg,
north of Bloemfontein:V -1;
French was skirmishing on
Saturday last with a party of
Boers trekking in a northwesterly
direction, a fact which seems to
prove that. Delarey and De Wett
are not going to intrench.them
selves at Osfontein or even Ab
rahams Kraal; beyond what im
mediate occasion requires.
In the : north 'of Cape Colony
all - three generals have been
showing many signs of activity.
â¢Gatacre reports that the number
of Boers lias palpably dwindled.
Stormberg is a strong, position,
which they seem most loth to
abandon, â¢ but in the east
and west the British ; are
driving,' the Boers -before
them with steady persist
ency. Brabant has secured La
buschagnes Nek after a stiff fight,
while Clements on the west has
occupied Achtetang,; apparently
without molestation 1 from the re
treating Boers. It would' seem
- . - - â¢Â¦ . -
tnat- the- wagon- Dnage nortn 01
Golesberg is in the hands of the
British troops.
There is no fresh news in
Northern Natal, save that no
Boers seem to be found witninja
radius of thirty, miles of Lady
smith".'The opinion is expressed
regarding Abrahams Kraal as a
possible point for Boer resistance
against.- Roberts' afmy, as that
place*, if not ideal, has no draw
backs.' It enables the flanks to
.be covered by a comparatively
â¢small force,' but can be readily
turned by either cavalry or infan
try, and the plain country behind
it, as well as its communications,
can be swept, but if well provi
sioned, it may prove a veritable
fortress and may not be quite so
rapidly either assailed or invested
as. those imagine who forget that
besides ' eight or ten thousand
men in position the Boers can
probably -support it a num
ber of field forces, aggregating
six or seven thousand . mounted
burghers. These could not be
brought into action against their
will, except by cavalry, and it is
doubted whether French has cav
alry enough, even including all
that is to be yet brought over the
Orange River, to force to a fight
the five or six mobile commandos
operating in combination with a
fixed position so long as; these
bodies have a supply basis on the
railway for their limited needs of
food. â¢
In other words, Roberts will
probably have {to strike at the
railway :Â¦ far behind Abrahams
Kraal, and if he does, he will have
to take exceeding care of his own
communications with the Kim
berley railway and even those of
the diamond city, as far as
Orange : River., The problem,
presupposing the . conditions
mentioned, is not an easy /one;
but it does not look by any
means impossible.

and .persistent are' the gamblers 'in their
crusade. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ â¢
-When Supervisor Tobin first introduced
his ordinance It was. believed that he was
sincere; " though mistaken* in* his * purpose.
The proceedings in and about the Board
of Supervisors yesterday- showed -to-^-a
demonstration, however, that Supervisor
Tobln knew thoroughly the character lof
his proposed l ordinance,' and -was acting
solely In behalf of the gamblers. . When
he found that â¢ his associates - would ; not
submit- to his outrage upon the communi

member, would not-- tolerate \ his j scheme
to legalize the depredations of.the.'gam
blers.'Tie asked Mayor Phelan'to announce
that the Police Committee 'was not ready
to report upon the licensed thievery, which
It had already indorsed. .':,. i
There Â¦ has seldom r been ; in - a ; - public
body so thorough and complete a humilia
tion as Supervisor Tobin , 'suffered yester

man of decent reputation," and to that Bup
posltion .he , owes his position in ' public
life. He is a, 'representative of an. Insti

certainly its success to the patronage of
the middle classes of the city. "Yet he at
tempted, in defiance of the, wishes of those
who make" him. possible, to set upon them;
a human vulture which. will devour. them.
As far as , the scheme of the gamblers
was concerned; the session of the ' Super
visorÃ yesterday was one of the most re
markable In 1 the ' history of the city.' The
proposition .* to- reopen r lngleside was Â« the
only matter of -moment; before thebqard.'
Long before, the. members ;- arrived r the.
Chamber was crowded -by citizens. -It was
known>that the Police Committee had de
cided' to; recommend the adoption -of â¢ the
Â§roposed ordinance, which had been lntro

Yet the people of the city were not dis
couraged. They were present through their
representative's to protest against the out
rage which had been planned. They ,wer^
determined ;,that they \ should"* be heaid,
and they filed into the supervisorial cham
ber to await the hearing which was due
In the congregation of protestants there
were several ministers of 'the Gospel.
Among them were the following: ' _ ' ;
Rev F. S. Ford, representing the Chris
tian ministers; Rev. E. A. Woods of the
Baptist ministers. Rev. John A., 8. Wilson
of the Methodist Episcopal ministers,; Rev.

report .which' It was expected to present ,
would not be submitted. The committee,
he said, desired further time and had not
been able. to agree upon a decision.
"Am I right, Mr., Tobin?" he said.
Tobin was resting. his head upon his
hand. Without changing his attitude. he
replled;"'You are right,- sir.";
The answer was 'interesting, in view, of
the fact that Supervisor Tobin had Intro
duced the ' gambling J ordinance - and I bad
forced the Police Committee to indorse It.
When he -was -asked later to explain his
conduct and. to tell why he" had not.lntro
duced the resolution which his' committee
had adopted- he declined to talk. Super
visor 'Reed ' said that he was not a free
agent; in; the -matter and that all inter
views, must be obtained from his princi
pal, Mr. Tobin. Supervisor Helms replied
in a similar vein, declaring that the whole
â¢matter â¢ was in the hands of Supervisor
Tobln.
Â¦ But'the incident was not by any means
closed: -The ministers present felt that
they had. a' duty to perform. The reopen
ing of ; lngleside Is a serious matter to
them.*. It cannot be dismissed, with a
smile such as accompanied Mayor Phe
lan's " announcement of postponement..
These - ministers had assembled in the
morning, each in the conference repre-'
senting" his people and their various pas
tors.. The outrage contemplated and
planned by. the.- gamblers had Â¦ been dis
cussed' and each congregation, i represent
ing a religious denomination, determined
to memorialize the Supervisors and pro
test against the gambling ordinance.
! In each conference a series of resolu
tions was prepared and adopted and when
Mayor Phelan announced that the gam
bling ordinance would not be acted upon
the Â¦ resolutions of protest were presented.
Those of the Presbyterian ministers and
churches of this city were typical and
were as follows:

"One cannot speak too h&rsbiy if the

leads many to the wayward path in life.
"In every community there is a certain
element among which gambling Is a habit
and the unfortunates, who compose this
element cannot resist temptation when it
Is before them. The only salvation we
have to offer such Is to place bad influ

Supervisors should think twice before

"The racetracks and the attendant gam

evils they incur cannot be overestimated
and are most detrimental, to the Interests

VAST SUMS VOTED
TO CARRY ON THE WAR
LONDON. March 6.â The House of Com
mons was crowded to-day in anticipation
of the budget statement. The report of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, Introducing the
budget, shows that an expenditure of
Â£154,052.000 has to be provided for in the
budget of 1&W-0L The statement shows
that the exchequer account of 1899-1900
would have given a surplus of upward of
Â£5,0u0,<i00. but that the supplementary .war
estimates of Â£23,0iÂ»0.000 make the ex
penditure exceed the revenue by Â£17.
770.0U0.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after
laying the figures before the House, point
ed out that the country has to face a total
estimated expenditure in consequence of
the war at no less than six times as much
Â«i> had been estimated in October last.
Against the estimated expenditure of
Â£154,0b2,000 for the coming year the Chan
cellor at the Exchequer estimated the rev
enue on the basis of taxation at Â£116,900,
Â©JO. or a deficit of Â£37.000,000.' i
Dealing with the war expenditures, he
said the Government had made the best
calculations as to the amount it ought to
ask from Parliament with the view of a
successful prosecution of the war. But it
was impossible to be certain when the war
would be concluded, and the expenditures
might be larger. On the other hand, how
Â«ver. a happy change in the military situ
ation and the fact that the season now
fast approaching was, in the opinion of all
the authorities, favorable to Boer opera
tions, had to.be considered. He might be
obliged in July or August to ask Parlia
ment for further relief, but he believed he
was fairly Justified in hoping that the in
ttnded expenditures would suffice to suc
cessfully conclude the war. He estimated
the total war expenditure, including
the deficit of Â£17,770.Cw0, at Â£60,000,000.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer char
acterized the suggested methods of fresh
taxation as in no way impracticable, say
ing the Government felt Justified in rais
ing a portion of the war funds by a loan,
but. he added, it was also Justified In call
ing upon the taxpayers for an immediate
and substantial sacrifice.
In this connection he thought they could
reasonably anticipate that the more acute
and more costly phases of the war would
not last long. He asked the taxpayers to
rubscribe to the cost of the war by an in
crease of the income tax to one shilling
in the pound, producing an additional
Â£ti .500,0 ft).
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach also said that
In order to meet a war expenditure of
Â£60.000.000 he would propose that the
etamp duties on stock exchange contract
notes be extended to sales on the produce
exchange; that the beer duties would be
increased a shilling a barrel of thirty-six
paHor.s; that there would be an increase
in the duty on spirits of 6 pence per pouno"
and tea 2 pence pÂ«r pound. He anticipated
that the foregoing changes wculd increase
the revenue .Â£12.217,000, and he proposed
to save Â£<.Â«lOjOOQ by suspending the sink
ing fund in relation to certain annuities.
He proposed to borrow the rest of the
necessary fund. A total of Â£43,000,000 had
to be raised, of which Â£8.000,000 was now
in thf. treasury and Â£25.000.000 would be
raisr-d by bonds or stock, repayable in a
term not exceeding ten years.
During the course of his remarks the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to
his previously expressed opinion regarding
the capacity of the Transvaal to bear a
responsible share In tne expenditure of
the war. said he etlll adhered to that
opinion, but he was bound to say that
the events of the last five months and the
claims which would undoubtedly be made
by the local colonists of Natal for com
pensation for losses sustained at the
bands of the Boers and the enormous in
crease In expenditure since he last spoke
had made him feel that the capacity, of
the Transvaal to bear the cost of the war

was a less Important factor, though It
was still an Important factor, "than he
estimated In October last
There has been a remarkable increase
In the receipts from the death duties,
totaling Â£17,471.000. of which Â£2,271,000 was
from the estates of millionaires, Including
Â£900.000 from the estate of one man, a
foreigner, who lived on 15 shillings a day
in a West End London club. The person,
he continued, however unwillingly, "had
contributed to the exchequer more than
the cost of an. ironclad. The foreigner
referred to is It* lÂ»te- George Smith, the
pioneer banker of Chicago, who died on
October 7. 1E99, In his rooms at the Reform
Club, London. . . . . .
Explaining the proposed Joan. | Blr
Michael Hicks-Beach said he believed It
would be a mistake to try to raise It by
a new Issue of consols, as It would create
a permanent debt which the nation could
not pay off at par until 1923. He thought
It would be better that part of the Â£35,
000,003 be reserved, say an. amount not
exceeding Â£5,000.000. for a further issue of
treasury bills. The rest he proposed -to
raise by bonds or stocks. He had reason
to believe it was possible to place such an
issue on very reasonable terms, and he
hoped to do bo in a way not to Insure
profit for a few great and wealthy per
sons, but to bring the whole -public into
the war loan and enable them to come to
the assistance of the country.
Timothy Ilealy, Irish Nationalist, pro
tested against Ireland having to pay any
thing toward the war expenses, asserting
that not a penny had been expended in
Ireland. The tax on whisky, he further
asserted, was an attempt to bleed Ireland.
"Let the diamond stockers," continued
Mr. Healy, "those who are making money
out of the war, pay the cost." ; .
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal,
complimented the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer on the soundness of his financial
principles, but said the country would like
to know how the Government intended to
insure that the Transvaal would ultimate
ly pay a large part of the cost of the .war.
He added: "It is said we are fighting for
liberty and freedom, so that, then there
Is a prospect of millionaires like Mr. Beit
and Mr. Hhodes having the taxation of
the Transvaal at their disposal. Of course,
the Government could not think of oppos
ing by a centralized taxation from Eng
land, and while England is being taxed
for the war it would be interesting to
know how the Government Intends to
realize. on the vague, misty expectation of
the gentlemen who will .be putting mil
lions into their pockets as a result of the
war. How are these men to be made to
pay?" "
John Redmond, the Nationalist leader,
said the Irish members regarded the war
as immoral and were therefore bound to
protest against the proposals of the Gov
ernment. He characterized the proposals
as "an Iniquitous budget, designed to up
hold an Iniquitous war."
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, In closing the
debate, thanked the House for the recep
tion given to the proposals and said the
Government hoped for an early conclu
sion of the war.- . : "V â¢ "Â¦'â¢.-"
After further argument the House
adopted the budget proposals.

2persons of his officials, has been captured
and he alone Is at large. Colonel Barry
says It will be hard for Agulnaldo to leave
the island, although not impossible. He Is
still in the northern provinces and the
troops are close after him.
The city of Manila Is quiet and trade
has been resumed not only In the town it
self, but In the surrounding- provinces and
along the Pasig River. The 8 o'clock or
dinance has been extended for citizens
to half-past 10. but the stores and saloons
close at 8 as before.
Colonel -Barry will go East without de
lay. He reported by telegraph to Wash
ington as soon as he landed, and he hopes
to receive orders to proceed this evening.
He is in excellent health, but he says the
work down there Is hard. It is probable
he will meet the President, the Secretary
of War and the commanding general with
the Philippine Commission and they will
discuss the Information he brings of the
state of affairs In the islands before the
commission leaves for the new possessions.
Colonel Barry says there Is no talk In
Manila about the recalling of Otis.
First Lieutenant Batson. who also
came up on the Grant, was the organizer
of the Maccabebe scouts. He and his men
chased Agulnaldo until they brought him
to bay, and in the engagement that fol
lowed Lieutenant Baston was wounded.
He organized the scouts at the Instance
of General Law ton. They proved a great
success. There are now five companies,
composed In all of 640 men, and Lieuten
ant Baston says they are the bravest set
of fellows he ever commanded.
Of the discharged soldiers who came up
on the Grant four were discharged with
out honor and eight dishonorably.
The Grant again comes Into port a
credit to the transport service. Chief
Officer Croskey and Chief Steward Her
bert kept the men in their respective de
partments v at work, and -In consequence
the ship is as clean as the day she left
San Francisco nine weeks ago.
A Lost Island.
Chief Officer Croskey reports that on
February 3 the ship sailed over the spot
where Morrell Island has generally been
supposed to be located. It is on all sailing
charts, but at 11:30 a. m. on the date men
tioned the Grant sailed over the position
in latitude 29 degrees 57 minutes north,
longitude 174. degrees 31 minutes east, and
not a trace of the Island could be found.
At noon any land forty feet . above the
level of the sea could be seen for a dis
tance of twenty-five miles. "The island
therefore cannot be in any latitude twenty
to twenty-five miles north or south or in
any longitude fifty miles east or west of
the position assigned."-, is the conclusion
reached by Mr. Croskey.
When the Grant left Manila Colonel
Bird and Major Mills of the transport
service were on a tour of Inspection. They
went to the islands via the Sues canal,
and every transport was thoroughly over
hauled by Â¦ them. Colonel Bird Is on his
way home via Hongkong, but Major Mills
will remain some time longer in the
islands. It Is said that Colonel Bird has
advised the Government to purchase the
chartered transports Indiana and Pena*
sylvanla to use as . interisland ships.

QUARTERMASTER'S FIX
Befused to Allow the Customs Offl*
cials to Board the Transport
Grant.
Quartermaster Baker of the Govern*'

serious trouble with the customs official*
at this port, and the indications arÂ» that
before he gets out of it his annual salary
will display a very large hole in the shapa
of a fine.
When the Grant arrived herÂ© several
months ago a large quantity of Manila
cigars were found concealed on board, tha
evident intention being to smuggle them
ashore. They were confiscated by tho
customs official?. On that occasion Quar
termaster Baker did conslderablo bluster-
Ing around the Custom-house ajid Igno
mlnlously failed in his attempt to bully;
the Government officials.
The memory of the past was no doubt
strong upon him, yesterday when tn<*
Grant steamed In through the Golden
Gate, for when the revenue cutter Golden
Gate came alongside with the customs
ofilcers Baker refused to Bl&nal to stop
the transport or to allow tbem to go on
board. When she came to anchor she was
boarded unceremoniously by the angry of
fflcials. and charges against Baker of hin
dering and obstructing customs officers in
the discharge of their duty were preferred
against the quartermaster. These charges
were filed with Collector Jackson, and It
the evidence shall be fmind to sustain
them Mr. Baker will be called upon to pay
a fine ranging from $50 to JMO.

ADELBERT GALE
WINS HIS SUIT
FOR DIVORCE
Proven That His Wife Was
Not Legally Entitled
to Marry.
She Fails to Substantiate. Her Claim.
Thai He Had a Wife Living
When They Were
Married.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March s.â The sensa
tional suit of Frances Grant Gale
against Adelbert Gale, proprietor of Gey
ser Springs, wherein the plaintiff asked
for the annullment of marriage and ali
mony upon the ground that at the time
Gale married her he already had a wife
living, came up for trial here to-day be
fore Judge Burnett in Department 1 of
the Superior Court. Prayer for alimony
was denied In short order, both sides unit
ing in a request for a speedy trial of the
annullment proceeding. The case was
called at 2 o'clock.
Mr. and Mrs. Gale both took the stand,
the latter in support of her claims and
the former in support of his counter
claim for a divorce upon the ground that
at the time the plaintiff had married him
she had not been divorced from her hus
band the required statutory time of one
year. After hearing the evidence Judge
Burnett granted the divorce to Gale as
prayed for in his cross complaint, it hav
ing been established that the plaintiff was
divorced from her former husband In Col
orado In December of 1898 and married to
the defendant at the (JeysSrs in this
county some eight months later, or on
August 5, -1899.
While on the stand Gale testified- that
he had admitted to the plaintiff shortly
after their marriage that he had been liv
ing with a woman whom he had introduced
as his wife, but. he denied that she was
ever such in fact. Gale is well known,
both in San Francisco and in this county.
His marriage, which was celebrated just
at the* height of the summer season of
last year, was a very dizzy event. If cur
rent reports are to be believed. Cham
pagne flowed like water and high revels
were held for a day or two. But the mat
rimonial bark, so auspiciously launched,
soon ran aground on the shoals of in

ment of to-day was the result. "Â¦

SAN JOSE, March s.â The city campaign
U opening up and from indications it will
be . the hottest one ever experienced in
San Jose. It will be the old light renewed
against the Rea gang, which tor so many
years has dominated and mismanaged
city affairs. The citizens are better or
ganized this year than in previous elec
tions, and they will have as their leader
a practical politician in the person of H.
J. Edwards as candidate for Mayor.
The committee of one hundred, repre
senting the best element of the city, will
conduct the war against the gang, and an
especial effort will be made to rid the city
of gang rule so that San Jose may be in
line to enjoy the "boom" benefits that will
come with the oompletion of the coast
road. The committee meets in two weeks
to make full nominations for the election
which occurs May 21. Back of the com
mittee of one hundred and giving it full
support will be the Republican Good Gov
ernment League, which has a county
membership of 2000 and which scored a
victory at the last county election.
Harry J. Edwards will be the citfzens'
nominee for Mayor, and his progressive
career as a resident of San Jose will give
him hundreds of votes from both Repub
licans and Democrats. William Fisher
will probably be nominated for Treasurer
and \\\ J. Dougherty for City Clerk. W.
G. Alexander is talked of for Councilman
in the Third Ward and J. W. Borchers
and Dr. Davy for the same position in thÂ«*
Second Ward.
The gang will support the incumbents in
office: C. J. Mayor; Thomas J.
McGeoghegan, City Treasurer, and J W
Cook. City Clerk. Councllmen Chase e.i
the ' Second Ward and Hatman in the
Third Ward, both of whom were appoint
ed by Mayor Martin to vacancies, have
declined to be candidates at the election,
and the members of the "push" are accus
ing them of having, "cold feet." Macken-'
zle, '.. who was always the brains of the
Rea push, and has succeeded the latter
as boss, will give the nomination for Coun
cilman in the Third Ward to Avery Por
ter. Selection has not yet been made for
Councilmen in the Second "Ward," but there
are no less than a dozen willing. **> 'Â¦;Â¦ Â¦Â¦
The "gang" is going to make a fight on

tion, and to open the campaign will spring
a lengthy., expert report showing the

Every -point will, be stretched to show a

the Coeur d'Alene investigation to-day.
He testified to the circumstances of his
removal from office shortly after the min
ing demonstration, his arrest and his Im
prisonment in the County Jail for five
days. '*...Â¦
A sharp controversy occurred between
Chairman Hull and Representative Lentz,
who conducted the .; examination, as to
whether or not the witness should state
his opinion on the necessity for martial
law. On a vote' the committee sustained
Hull and excluded this line of inquiry.
William Powers testified that he was
night watchman and constable at Mullan,
Idaho, at the time of the demonstration
at Wardner. He disclaimed any knowl
edge of the blowing up of the mining
property. . He fbw , two wagon-loads of
men returning from Wardner late in the
day after the explosion. The town was
entirely quiet and men went about their
work as usual. A week after the demon
stration the witness was arrested by sol
diers, but later was released. Â¦ He was
summoned to appear before the United
States Industrial Commission, when he
was again arrested by a deputy., He de
manded to know what charge was against
him, whereupon, he said, the deputy drew
a pistol and an exciting affray occurred,
In which the deputy lost his "gun." A
soldier interfered and Powers was arrest
ed and put into the "bull pen."- He Bent
word to the- Industrial' Commission that
he was there.' and they notified him that
the commission' would come to the "pen",
and take the testimony of all prisoners.
But the, witness said this testimony was
never taken, < and he never learned the
nature of the charge 'against him.
-Powers said the families of Imprisoned
men suffered until a commissary store
was established at Mullan and about $11,
000 .of the charitable contributions from la
bor organizations and the Anti-Trust As
sociation was distributed. The military
terrorized the people and the women com
plained-that the negro soldiers attempted
to enter their houses. One woman whhose
husband was in the "bullpen" had a note
signed "A Colored Soldier" put under her
door. * ' ..
On cross-examination efforts were made
to get the names of. the men who returned
after the blowing. up of- the mining prop
erty. Lentz protested to this as in the line
of "intimidation," Â¦:Â¦ as the " information
could be used to make military r arrests.
Representative Lentz said he had about
concluded ; the direct presentation of the
case, and after, hearing one witness to
morrow would, yield to General Merrlam,'
Governor Steunenberg and others denying
the charges. Several witnesses.- including
Former Master Workman Sovereign' of
the* Knights : of Labor, he said, would be
reserved for rebuttal. Lentz asked that
the committee again call on the War De
partment for all telegrams connected with
the subject, : and particularly .the original
instructions to . General Merriam. PThin
was agreed to. ~ -'. Â¦ ." Â¦*Â¦".- . â¢ ?. â¢ Â¦*--? >,-,
, Lentz asked that President McKinley bÂ«
asked to submit affidavits alleged to have
been filed by citizens of Idaho -showing :
that there was no need of martial law ana
that ; abuses i were - recurring Â¦* under n the
military system. This request went over.

On the matter of his home-coming and
his reasons ' for leaving t the 'Philippines
the general had nothing to say. Any
question he did not want to answer he
simply failed to hear. This was a thing
that could be done with great ease ' and
without any appearance of discourtesy,
as the general was on the hurricane deck
of the transport while the questioner was
away below on the deck of a tug.
In speaking of his voyage home General
Is delighted with the Americans and Is
very glad to be under the shelter of the
stars and stripes.
From Sulu the Warren went to Hong
kong and there General Wheeler and his
daughter were the guests Â¦of the Gov
ernor. A stay of four days was made,
during which time the shlD was coaled.
The next stopping place was- Guam: and
there none of the crew of the transport
were . allowed 'to land. ? The Warren re
mained five days and during that time the
general and his party visited all the points
of interest in the island. From Guam the
Warren went to Honolulu, where another
stop of five days was made, and then the
prow ,of the good ship was turned for
home. - . Â¦
There were no new cases of plague In
the islands since the Australia â¢ailed, but,
nevertheless, the quarantine officer would
not take any chances and 'the Warren
was ordered to Angel Island.
Praise for the Islands.
General Wheeler is enthusiastic over
the new possessions of the United States.
He says it only requires American brains
and American push to make the Phlllp-

GILDERSLEEVE CRITICIZED
Stanford Men Object to the Appoint-
ment of Yost as Coach.
Special D*^>atch to The Call. , Â¦
STANFORD UNrVERSTTT, March 5.â
A storm that bids fair to seriously Involve
the leaders in football matters is gather
ing at Stanford University. The cause of
the trouble Is -Manager Gildersleeve's ap
pointment of F. H. . Yost to' coach th<Â«
cardinal squad this fall. Many . of thÂ«
athletes feel that if Chamberlain is not
to come back his successor should at least
be a man who brings with him the pres
tige of, one of the big Eastern colleges
The objection to Yost Is that he comt-a
from a small college, and â¢Is not . known
to the leaders of -the college game -in the
East..' â¢- ?-s 'Â¦ â¢. , f-. ; . v-:
The leader of the discontented faction
is Captain Burnett, who ; is 'to lead the
cardinal team through.thet season, and
on whom â¢ more Â¦ than i any other man ' the
outcome of next -year's game depends.
With him are the graduate coachers and
a large part of the student body. They
feel that . Glldersleeve should Â¦. have can
vassed the. field more thoroughly .before
he made his choice.- ,. " Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦ .
Burnett stated:hls complaint before the
student executive committee to-day, and
was unofHclally 1 promised' that the-con
tract with Yost will not be-authorlzed
without hiss having a hearing.- At the
meeting next Wednesday both captain
and manager! will be present," when it is
hoped the differences-, will be.a micably
settled. .: . -. :â¢ ?

SPENCER HAS
NIGHTMARE ON
COMBERMARE
Eases the Fast Colt Up and
Is Beaten Out by Thorpe
on Lucidia.
Spencer, the frapped saddle artist, cre
ated a mild Ber.sa.tion at Oakland yester
day by getting the two-year-old Comber
mere beaten, after looking a 1 to 20
chance in the stretch. The youngster
was a heavily played .favorite, and out
footing his lield a block at the commence
ment. Spencer, while tramping through
the deep and inuaay tooting uext .. tne
rail,, began taking up his -.-mount. .Thorpe,
astride Lucidla, the second choice, never
<iuit riding, and catching the tavorite op
posite the paddock, -won out in a. 1 .hard
Ortve by a uecit. If Spencer continues
riding in his present form he will soon be
a drug on the market.
The different events were very common
place, in which favorites captured but
two purses.
For the first event, a six furlong selling
run. with a field of eleven starters, both
Isaline and Gussie Fay opened up at 5 to
2. The coin went in on Isaline. cutting her
odds to 6 to 5, and after shaking off the
60 to 1 shot, Pidalia, the Sink Hllr won
easily. Louise Hayman drew out of the
bunch the last part, taking the show. -
Barney Schreiber's colt Â¦ Boundlee went
to the post a 7 to It) favorite for the dash
over the Futurity course, and was kept
busy winning at the wirÂ«. Clarando, a 40
to 1 shot, displayed a high turn of speed,
compelling IJullman to ride the first
choice out. Orion ran an indifferent
third.
A long price worked'qnite a difference
in the speed of Scotch Plaid. The ring
laid 7 and 8 to 1 against his chances in
tne mile njn. decided under selling condi
tions. After Silver Tone, the favorite, and
Perseu* had raced away in the lead to
the stretch. Jenkins moved up with Scotch
Plaid, beating the first choice out hand
ily at the stand. Show honors -went to
Perseus.
Horton furnished the surprise In th*e
fifth event, a mile and a'slxteenth' sellidg
affair. Wyoming opened an even money
chance, but as it was .figured the holding
mu<l would not be to his liking, the price
wfnt to E to 2. while Morinel -closed fa

Orpheum.
There are three way above the ordi
nary first-class specialties at the Or
pheum this week, and they are so good
that they amply atone for the mediocrity
of some ot the others. The first is the
"Smedley Sketch Club," the pivotal at
tractions of which are two wonderfully
clever children in the dramatic line, who
do the balcony scene from "Romeo and
Juliet" in a manner that would put to
shame the ordinary amateur. The sketch
.is .one of the best .that have been seen
on the Orpheum stage, and winds up with
a pretty tableau. Newhouse^and Ward
are 'emperors at riding the bicycle, either
in the comic or serious vein. Anna Whit
ney's bicycle story is a little too long for
the quallt}'. " Her singing Is more of a suc
cess.. The Si Hassan Ben All troupe of
acrobats are agile and. speedy tumblers
and make one dizzy to look at them. The
holdoversâ the Passparts, Pauline Moran,
the Franks trio, Trovollo and the bio
graphâare as welcome and as enjoyable
as ever.

Eight week 3 ago the Tlvoll presented
"The Idol's' Eye" to the theater-goers* of

-which greeted , the.; popular, comic
opera last rrigirt the pnblic still craves for
it. Its run has been surprising' and bids
fair to snrpaaa_thatjof "Ship Ahoy," which
was presented at the same theater a year
ago: -- Ferris Hartman has a new batch of
Jokes and -BomV topical songs that ars
bound to "keep er' humming." The "Hoot
Mon" of Alf Whelan is as furirty as ever,
and the clever impersonator of that dif
ficult role has added a few new wrinkle 3
that arouse great mirth. The chorus has
a number of new dances and pretty cos
tumes. -The >ladles In the principal rolea
have songs to delight the ear, and, in fact,
the production has so many features that
it can ,be seen and enjoyed as .on the first
occasion. ' - Â»;;.?'â¢. -'Â£
California,
. ! The second performance of. Edwin C.
Jepson's melodrama, "Darkest Russia,"
at the California Theater, drew a fairly
large ' audience fast' night.. There was,
however, no room to spare in the upper
part of the - house, from which Issued
rounds- of applause or storms of hisses,
as the situations on the stage demanded.
The company worked in harmony and the
members received several hearty calls be
fore the curtain. On the afternoons -of
the 6th, 7th and Bth and evenings of the
12th;" 13th and 14th the California Theater

BUSTLING FUN
IN ALCAZAR'S
FRENCH FARCE
First Local Performance of
"Never Again" Makes
a Great Hit.
IT IS to laugh. "Â¦ I have been' waiting
patiently these two years for a local
production of "Never Again," which
I have been describing as the funniest
French farce "that ever happened. It
was presented last night at j the Al
cazar, and turned out to be the fmost
humorous diversion we have had in many
a mooru . ' ' ; j .', i J., ' ':.'.: .'. - , '*' ' Â¦'
;.,The, company .handled the wild' comedy
With'becpmlng extravagance, and there is
little to criticize in their mad workman
shlpi.'Â¦Â¦>' '.-Â»Â¦'â¢ â¢<Â¦ SJiw tÂ» ;-?Â¦>Â¦.â¢/!.' -.. :-!:>â¢'Â»?
"'â¢" "Never Again" Is a simple hurricane of
fun, and the Alcazar: company succeeded
in making it thoroughly mirthful. Con
trasted with the clever Frohrnan, people,
who grappled the characters with a. subtle
understanding of comedy values, the work
of our modest stock company can hardly
bo called masterful, but what they, lack
in finesse they make up In enthusiasm
Â¦ and the boisterous humor of the < farce
igoes with a gallop. "â¢--'Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦;!
1 In the second act the action is cyclonic
and the audience shaky with laughter;
everything Is overdone and nobody cares;
.actors ana audience Join in. the whoop-la
and merriment, carries the night. â¢
. Ernest , Hastings is given prominence
and earns it in the part of Herr Katzen-
Jammer: He not only knows his part,
Â¦ but carries it' off-with admirable effect.
The eccentric make-up and German, ac
cent are tests of his. fitness for character
work-iand he manages both with;surpris
ing cleverness. Â¦ JefTrey Williams makes
Â¦as much of his part as any one could,-ex
cept E. M. Holland, whom he again Iml-
: tates. He counterfeits the Holland voice
and copies the Holland grimace and but
for an abbreviation: of .Holland's- never
failing thoroughness in pantomime and
'by-play his fac simile would be perfect.
Even without originality' Mr. Williams is
clever and the Alcazar Company has a
valuable member in one who can so
cleverly mimic one of the character stars
of -the stage. ? - -
The company works hard to. make
"Never Again", go and it succeeds. Tor It
goes with a whirr from beginning to end.

â¢large audience at. the Grand Opera-house
last night, and , when ; the catchy songs
.'become ipore. 4 familiar^ there will 'not bÂ«
the same lack of encores as prevailed on
the initial presentation. It Is Justly called
, a ''musical eccentricity," and ..from, the
â¢opening, chorus to the finale v there- are
songs, duets, quartets and concerted
pieces 'lnnumerable. â¢ The most popular
Â¦were the- duet, --"I'm-- All the <Way from

and Â¦ created a ' most ' favorable impression
as M. Augusta' Pompier, a French spy;

ALL is in. readiness at the Olympic
Club for the boxing and wrestling
tournament which will be Inaugu
rated to-night. The blw gymnasium
has been converted into, an ideal
;f rrria and seats have been arranged to
comfortably accomodate 2CKW spectators.
The entries in the various classes are fit
v> struggle for honors ,and there Is every
likelihood that the followers of amateur
sport srill enjoy a treat wliich will last
five days. A large advance pale of tickets
lias been recorded and the institution will
in all probability be recouped for moneys
cutlayed in bringing the seven athletes
from the East to contest against the best
that this city an*! vicinity .can produce in
the two prominrnt sports.
Thirteen boxing bouts will be seen on
the initial night. The members of the
f;eatner-w<>tght, special 125 pounds, light
weight and heavyweight divisions, will
furnish the opening night's eport. Every
man who stops under the ropes to assert
fcis ability as a boxer has faithfully train
ed for the events and will be capable of
enduring punishment without flinching or
suffering from after effects. Every entry
has been examined as to his' qualifications
as an amateur by the Pacific Coast-Ama
teur Athletic. Association. 'and all Â¦ have
been foujid to be within the requirements.
When the gong sounds for the opening
bout Jack Kitchen,- "the well-known 1 ama
teur champion heavyweight, and one of
the most popular -referees on' the cpast,
will officiate ln< his usual capacity. He has
been chosen to act as referee. because of
his knowledge of the fistic pastime and
the amateur rules which govern such con
tests. Stewart Carter arid Elmer Fentress,
two .Tclever amateur boxers, Â¦: will' act -in
the capacity of Judges. Fred Bute, the
well-known foot racer and handball play
er, . will act as timekeeper, and' "Bob",
McGlbbon will officiate as announcer. . ; -?
Great" Interest is being centered â¢in the
Eastern boxers and"- wrestlers, and their
appearance in the arena will be the signal
for great cheering, a* the local followers
of athletics admire the pluck of the young
fellows who crossed the Continent to do
battle with- perfect strangers.. J. <L.
Scholes Jr.. amateur of Eng
land,, Canada and United States, and WU
11am Rodenbach, a three-times tourna
ment winner, will'be seen Â¦ to-night in the
ring. Splendid reports of. their prowess
have preceded them, and their showing
will.be watched with deep Interest. .
The Eastern athletes are housed in the
dent that some of his pupils will -make
him hustle lively to retain nis laurels.
Wrestling- has always been a â¢ favorite"
pastime at the local institution and many
clever men have been' developed. In the
lightweight, class ; Wiley will be pitted
against some good material. Should he be
drawn to wrestle J. H.. Spiro he-will meet
an opponent who is his equal In build and
strength. Spiro is said to be the strong
est man , In the club, and- he- has been
taught how to use his tremendous powers
to advantage. " ' Â¦ ; Â¦ : . ..; '
' C. S. Pray, who is entered in the welter
weight class, is. a, coming man in wrest
ling. He has only been at the sport a
short time, but has steadily. Improved and
is now looked upon as a dangerous man.
The Reliance Club has sent" a number of
good men to represent it in the tourna
ment, and other amateur Â¦ organizations
are alike well represented. - â¢â¢ ...
Â¦â¢Â¦ The wrestling bouts will be presented
to-morrow night. A large number of con
tests will be held and the spectators will
have an opportunity of Judging. the merits
of most of . the entries. â¢ ...
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed an ordinance granting the Olym
pic Club permission -to hold the boxing
tournament and fixing its license at $100
a year. The usual charge Is $1000 a year,
but for such clubs as the Olympic, which
only permits amateur contests, the
amount Is set at a very low figure. At
the close- of the tournament the club in
tends to keep- the Eastern contingent here
another ' week and- entertain" them in re
turn for their efforts. â¢

Engineer's Presence of Mind Saves
a Train.
REDDING, March 5. â The presence of
mind of Engineer Silsby, in charge of the
southbound California express due ' here
from Portland at 10 a. m., saved the train,
from being wrecked this morning. While
running at a high rate of speed the train
rounded a curve a mile below Castella,
when Engineer Sllsby, who was on the
lookout, saw a barrier of rocks across the
track a short distance ahead. He Instant
ly grasped his throttle and applied th*>
air brakes. The train slid along, impelled
by the tremendous impetus, but came to a
standstill in time to avoid a collision with
the mass.
A large number of rocks, some of them
weighing several tons, had fallen down
the nlll and completely blocked the track.
The section crew from Castella was soon
on the scene and by rapid work managed
to clear and repair the track In two and
a half hours and the train proceeded.

CARTER DECLARES HE
WILL VOTE FOR QUAY
WASHINGTON, March s.â Carter of
Montana dealt vigorously with the Quay,
case jin the v Senate, to-day ' in Â¦ the couf ?e
of an explanation as-, to why he, would
vote 'for the former Senator from Penn
sylvania, notwithstanding that he voted
against the seating of. Corbett, in the lart
Congress, g -. : : . .._
When the conference report on the tinan
cial bill was called" up ' Teller of ' Colorado
resumed his speech- opposing its adoption.
The proposed ' .legislation, he ' believed,
would be disastrous to the country and
was the culmination, of -an' effort- begun
soon after the, civil war to make money
dearer' by destroying one-half themetnllic
money of the, world. -Under it great for
tunes would be acquired by the rich, while
the poor would be made poorer, ft
The pension appropriation bill, whicn
appropriates $145,245,230, was passed, and
then- Carter- of Montana addressed the
Senate in favor of seating Quay, as Sen
ator from Pennsylvania.- He 'argued' tho t
the constitution contemplated that, tl-e
seats in the Senate always should be kept
full. â¢ â¢ Â¦ . Â¦ >: -â¢?;â¢... .
Referring to the- precedents of the Man
tle. Allen and Beckwith cases, Carter de
clared that the silver question really .hfc.l
decided those cases, but added' that not
withstanding .the administration . opposed
seating Mantle because of silver, tha.. gen
tleman would have ; been seated if the
pairs had been properly arranged . on . tha t
vote, and Allen and Beckwith also would
have been seated, as their cases were do
pendent upon the decision in the Mantle
"Thus," he said, "in 1893 a technicalir-y
made the recorded verdict of the Senate
the reverse- of its real judgment." ;;. . -
As to the* Corbett case Carter said:
My vote was Â¦ recorded against Corbett. and
it would. -be registered Â¦ in the same-way again
on the same state. of facts. The Oregon .Legis
lature was prevented organizing until after the
time, limit of carrying . Into effect the will of
the people had expired, and It was believed by
many that Corbett .was the inspiring genius
of . that -revolutionary conduct. A. large .num

JUDGE TAFT IS
NOT IN FAVOR
OF EXPANSION
New President of the Phil
ippine Commission Op
poses Imperialism.
Sensational Reply to the Speech of a
Friend Who Denounced the Pol
icy of the Adminis
tration.
CINCINNATI, March s.â The compli
mentary dinner given to-night af the
Queen City Club to Judge William H.
Taft, the recently appointed president of
the Philippine Commission, by his friends
and neighbors, was unique In its elegance
and in its goodwill. The hundred sub
stantial citizens who took this method of
bidding farewell to their friend Included
the representative men of . Cincinnati, j
Among the speakers was Judge Judson
Harmon, who was Attorney General un
der the last Cleveland administration and
whose association with Judge Taft at tho
Cincinnati bar has been contemporaneous.
He created a sensation in his opening
sentence, though It was understood the
company had not been chosen with the
view Â¦of political harmony. Judge Har
mon, in part, said:
If you had met to approve the general course
of the Government with respect to the Phil
ippines I should not be here. For a hundred
years we contented ourselves with words of
sympathy for peoples struggling, as we once
struggled, for ireedom and Independence.
Here, for the first ttme, an opportunity came
to help in such a struggle without breaking
our settled policy. We Joined ranks with thÂ«
native patriots against the common enemy.
Whether any one made or was authorized to
make promises to them is of no consequence.
Our history and principles are Â¦ a perpetual
promise; and no one will deny that when the
Killpinos Joined forces with us they believed,
and we knew they believed, that success would
mean the fulfillment of their hopes. â¢ â¢ â¢
When we came to terms of peace It was our
duty to put an end to the claims of Spain. As
to all the territory, except a few square miles,
these were the barest of pretensions, but Span
ish greed and other greed might - make a
speculative asset of them to the Injury of our
allies. This was the only possible justifica
tion for the direction to our commissioners
to purchase these claims, and we naturally
expected some, declaration of trust. Ho did
our aJlles. But it soon turned out that. In
stead of buying off the King' of Spain, tue
Government bought him out and â¢ proposed to
realize on the investment.
Spain Bunkoed Uncle Sam.
Our only real war followedâ a war which a
word would have averted If our Government
had been willing to say it, and whose victories
aroused no gladness In our people like those
over Spain. The Government got absolutely
nothing by the treaty with Spain except color
of title to a small part of the territory, and
consequent color of right to make war on the
inhabitants without action by Congress. What
ever It now holds (save what It got by treaty
with the Sultan of Sulu). It has acquired by
conquest from them, and not otherwise, and
It U still engaged in perfecting and extending
such conquest. We now hear the usual plea
of the doers of doubtful thingsâ the deed Is
done. It Is too late to discuss it. â¢ â¢.. â¢
It is never too late to retrace a mlsstea. to
right or undo a wrong. If the people shall de
cide that no nation Is good enough to rule an
other nation without the other nation's consent;
If they shall remember what It cost us to cast
out the heresy that the great principles of lib
erty did not apply to black men and shall re
fuse to re-kmbrace It as to brown ones; If they
shall conclude that this country cannot long
exist part vassal and part free, as thÂ«y found
it could not live part slave and partfreÂ«, then
there will be no difficulty in doing what we
ought to have done In the beginningâ leave the
Filipinos to manage their own affairs, and
serve notice to the world that they are under
our protection. ,
Judge Harmon declared that the ques
tion would never be settled until it was
settled right. In the meantime, he said.
It was the duty of the United States to
provide a Government for the islands.
While the President's right to make reg
ulations in the nature ol laws was doubt
ful, Judge Harmon said, his right and
duty to provide agencies for enforcing the
laws werexlear. He discussed most forci
bly a,nd af length the great. work before
the new Filipino Commission, and in a
most eloquent eulogy on Judge Taft de
clared that no man in the whole country
could have been selected who was better
qualified than Judge William H. Taft for
the great mission that awaited him.
. Taft Not an Expansionist.
: The silence -which marked the opening
remarks by Judge Harmon was intense.
At length when applause broke out it was
followed by a remark In the room, "Just
four of you." But when Judge Harmon
declared the duty of th<? Government to
be the establishment of "Â¦ a protectorate
over the Islands the applause was con
tinued. He produced undisguised sur
prise when he hinted that one of the best
qualifications of Judge Taft for this mis
sion was the fact that he was not an ex
pansionist.
Judge Taft, who followed, spoke for an
hour, devoting much time to his asso
ciates of trie Cincinnati bar, ' the Cincin
nati University and municipal and State
politics and with feeling words of thanks
for the tributes of his friends. Coming to
the topic of the Philippines, he said in
part:.. . /
The commission, is/not organized.^ Its mem
bers have . not conferred : together. â¢'-, I > sDeak,

FATHER YORKE'S discourse Sunday
night on "The Social Evil" has cre
ated, a most profound sensation In
the community. His_ assertions that
San Francisco's morals are in a de
plorable condition and that society.
winks at all sins provided the sinner is
not found out Is a statement so bold in its
meaning as to fairly startle the populacp.'
The argument so often 'advanced of the
necessity of the social evil was attacked
in unmeasured terms by the eloquent
speaker. ; ...
Social Evil Will. Always Exist. Â¦
"Whenever the question is. raised there
is never any serious speculation about the
possibility of its extirpation," said Father
Yorke. "Men of the world laugh at such
a thought. The social evil always has befn
and always will be. We may debate about
regulating of it, about keeping it within
bounds, about curbing its excesses,' but
the thing itself, they hold, must exist in
some form or other. It is human nature;
they say. and human nature is the court
of last resort. iVf Â¦â¢_â¢-.
"Moreover, they hold it is universal. The
world has no belief in purity. It knows
only its own experiences.- It knows how
strong the passions of the body are. how
early they come to maturity, "how quickly
they cloud the mind and master the heart.
They know how weak reason is against
them, and knowing no other power it docs
not believe that they can be conquered.
Hence the world scoffs at the very taei
of successful and continued self-restraint.
It mocks the claims of chastity; it is glad
when a public scandal seems to Justify its
principles. It has itself been worsted in
the battle, and. such is the meanness of
its Intellectual make that It cannot take
In the idea that others may succeed who
flght with other weapons.
Sin of Being- Found Out. Â»
"Besides Its maxims the world has its
laws or rather, its law, to regulate tnis
evil That law is summed up in the word
respectabilityâ do not be found out. We
are compelled to make certain concessions
to the moral sense of our souls, and that
concession will be to hide the evil. Blessed
are they that are not found out. If they
are found out they have broken the
world's law. and the world has its punlsii
ment That punishment Is characteristic
of the world that Is of the animal. The
woman is branded and cast out. and
women, unfortunately, are her bitterest
accusers and her severest Judges and her
most savage executionists. As .for. tho
man, the censure of the world -Is- much
lignter. By society he is very easily for
given; though In public life the penalty Is
greater. " Your own memory will call back
to you many. Instances of men who : were
driven .Into- obscurity because they..com
mitted the unpardonable sin of -being
found out.'! â¢ â¢ â¢ . . â¢ â¢ Â« ' ,
No Effort to Hide Our Shame.
Â¦The eminent divine said that California
âand San Francisco In .particular.âover
looks the conventions of outward decorum
and' respectability which the world Itself
imposes; that it makes no effort te hide
its social evil, but flaunts it intf.e'face
of decency and allows It to creep around
the churches and the schools and to in
trude Itself Â¦in some cases even- to -the
family fireside. Continuing, Father Torke
said: â¢-â¢_"Â¦ ---
.".There. is some excuse for those visitors
who' make only a short stay here and see
only the- most obvious-features* of our
town, and who go away declaring that
San Francisco is the worst cit>"'Tn the
world and the very vestibule of the In
fernal regions. . . Â¦
Not Choice in Our Company.'
Â¦ "I think I am not making a rash-asser
tion when I say that society here Is far
more easy in its 'conditions of public mo
rality than society in any other, part of
America, not 'to speak of the rest .of the
world. People are received and -welcomed,
many of whom In other communities
would be excluded from respectable doors.
It is this- practice and this general -feeling
that make it unsafe for a rich man'- with a
character to lose to die- In '.California.
There have been so. many strange cases,
and they have been made so little of that
a jury Is more or less disposed to'take It
for granted that any accusation and every
claim must be well founded. *ftt*r ?
"Hence the Interminable lawsuits, the
swearing: and the ' counter-sweorlhgr. the
examination and the cross-examination
and the turninp of . family closets -Inside
out and. the breaking down of the. walls
of whlted sepulchres which have 'given
California within the- last quarter..' of a
century such a peculiar name. â¢ .
"In honorable marriage alone' may men
follow that Instinct which God -has Im
planted in them for ' the preservation of
the race, but outside of that state, there
Is no compromise. Nay, more, not only
are acts forbidden, but also Is every im
proper word, every carnal thought. "We
cannot yield ono single fraction or an Inch
to the body." . ~ â¢, "- .

BRAZIL. Ind.. March 5.â A miners'
train carrying four hundred workmen
employed at the mines north of here to
their homes in this city was run into by
a local freight train on the C. and I. at 6
o'clock this evening and the caboose and
two cars were shattered. Melvin Easter

Among the injured are: Thomas Bar
rowan, both legs broken; John Dickson,
back broken; Thomas Davis, both arms
broken; John Little, arm broken.
The wreck occurred In a deep cut In the
cer.ter of a short curve. The railroad
company sent a special train and brought
the injured to this city. All the vehicles
obtainable at the livery stable and car
riages from private houses were obtained
to take the men to their respective homes.
Hundreds of women gathered at the depot
and grasped their maimed and -'bleeding
husbands and brothers In their arms when
they were carried from the train.

Eyecial Dispatch to Tfce Call.
DULUTH, Minn.. March 6.â While the
pood people of California are holding up
their hands in holy horror at the prospect
of losing one of the crowning glories of
the State, the famous Calaveras big tree
prove, the man who is credited with the
Intent to turn those noble giants of the
forest Into prosaic lumber of commerce
Is saying nothing. Bob Whltesides. the
man who has the option on the grove, is
an old-time lumber and iron land dealer
of this city, and. during the years he has
been at It, has gradually worked up a
fortune, much of which has come within
the last few years.
Until recently no one knew he was
branching outside the pine regions of
Northern Minnesota, and It was a sur
prise to hear, not only that he was en
gaged la timber operations In California
en a large scale, but that he had an op
tion on the famous grove of sequoias and
that he had become the bogey man of
the West, because he was credited with
the Intention of putting up a sawmill In
the grove and turning out lumber.
Whitesides' Statement.
To a correspondent of The Call be said
to-day: "That calaveras grove subject Is
cettint a little worn v ith me, but 1 don't
mind telling about it. The lons and short
of It is that 1 have an option on me erove
lor *luO.<Â«Â»0 and 1 have paid JIPW to bind it.
On April 1 the option expires, and before
that ume 1 shall pay the remaining jy9,oC>o
and the grove will be Turned over to me.
What do I Intend to do with It? I can
hardly state until I get it. but I wilt say
that it is a business proposition with me
and 1 shall mane money out of It. That
is about all there is to It; at least, all I
care to say about it now."
Mr. Whueside* has already purchased
O<XXi acreg of timber west of the grove, and
the grove came naturally into the sphere
of his operations when he found it could
be bought. It -can be stated, however, he
has never expressed his intention of cut
ting up the trees into lumber. Whether
the idea has been in his head does not
matter, for the sole reason tor the fear
that he Intends to cut down the grove is
that he Is a lumberman, and that when he
has purchased grounds in the past he has
had the idea of turning the trees into lum
ber in view. There is little question that
if he has an opportunity to sell the grove,
either to the Government or to the State
of California, he will do so if It Is to his
advantage.
Opinions of Friends.
Mr. Whitesides is amply able to buy the
ground, and. as ; he states, he will un
doubtedly buy it when the time comes.
As to whether he will set up his sawmill
there, as Californians fear, that is some
thing he refuses to divulge. Among those
who know him best there is a feeling that
this matter, which is of such great mo
ment to the people of California, is a huge
Joke to him. They believe he saw a chance
ro buy the prove for much less than It
was v.-orth and bought it. They do not
believe he will cut down the trees; neither
do they believe that he will put his money
in th<- grove and let it lit* Idle, even though
the public is greatly benefited thereby.
They believe he will have a chance to sell
out at a profit and will accept it, and
whether it proves to be the State of Cali
fornia or the Government the grove will
be safe from vandalism.
Work at Washington.
WASHINGTON. March s.âRepresenta
tive de Vrks' prediction that he would
have the sequoia big trees grove bill In
the hands of the President for his signa
ture by Wednesday bids fair to be real
ized. The measure as it passed the House
Is now before the Sonate. To-day Sena
tor Hansbrough. chairman of the Public
Lands Committee, was directed to makt
a. favorable report on the bill Introduced
in thÂ» Senate by Perkins at the same time
that De Vries offered his measure In the
House. To-day at the re<jue?t of Perkins
the report was withheld in order that to
morrow morning he can ask unanimous
<-onseiit to substitute the De Vries bill for
his on and thus secure Its immediate
passage. In this way all the time other
wise consumed in engrossing the bill a
Fecond time i* saved. De Vries may even
find It possfble to take the bill to the
White itouse to-morrow evening.

WHAT THE CABINET WANTS.
IZJDWARD H. COLEMAN contributes to tha
current number of Ainslee's Magazine an article
* â * concerning statements of six members of the
Cabinet as to the work they most desire to see
achieved in their respective departments of the ad
ministration. The six officials are the Secretaries of
War, Navy, Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, and the
Postmaster General, and their views comprise a val
uable compendium of important, measures now be
fore the country, t
The Secretary of War desires mainly the reorgani
zation of the army; the Secretary of the Navy wishes
a settlement of the armor plate controversy, and an
act providing a suitable reward for the naval officers
who took part in the Santiago campaign, as was
given to those who were at Manila, The Secretary of
the Treasury is of course chiefly interested in meas
ures affecting the monetary standard and banking and
currency. The Secretary of the Interior regards a
reform of the pension laws as the most urgent issue
in his department, while the Secretary of Agriculture
seeks to bring about improvement in the highways
of the country and the cultivation of tea in the United
States, and the Postmaster - General, announces his
principal desire to be an act putting an . end to the
abuse of second class postal rates.
Most- of these measures have been so fully discussed
that the public is fairly familiar with what the admin
istration isÂ« doing with respect to*them. The work
of the Department of Agriculture, however, in pro
moting road improvement has been but-little rioted,
owing to the fact that as the National Government has
no control over highways the work of the department
is necessarily confined to educating the . people on
the subject. It can do little that attracts attention,
and the indirect help given does not make much of a
figure in the news of the day.
In a late report the Secretary- in dealing with the
subject, says: "There is a great demand upon the
Department of Agriculture for assistance in road
making, in addressing the students at our Agricultural
Collepjes.'and in giving instruction regarding the best
methods of using what material may be found- con
venient." For the purpose. of obtaining. information
on these questions the Secretary recommends the ap-;
pointment of competent men in each of the great sec
tion* of the Union, who would ascertain and re-jjort
THE COMMERCIAL CONGRESS.
IHJOR the purpose of giving a wide fame to the
I . proceedings of the recent Commercial Con
* gress and perpetuating the; records of the event
the Philadelphia Commercial Museum has published
a handsome quarto volume containing full reports of
the addresses made and work done during the seven
teen days the congress lasted.
From the- record it appears the congress was at
tended by representatives of thirty-eight foreign
Governments and 112 Chambers of Commerce and in
dustrial organizations in all ' parts -of 'the globe, and
there were presented to the congress over 150 papers
on subjects concerning commercial affairs and the
trade interests of nations.
Among the resolutions adopted were . those in
favor of the assimilation of trademark laws and the
establishment of a common standard: in favor of
the extension of the parcels post system; in favor
of a uniform system of gathering and presenting
trade statistics; in favor of an 'international bureau
for the collection and dissemination of the agricultural
reports of commercial nations as to their cereals;
recommending to the various Governments and com
mercial bodies, the Philadelphia Commercial Mu
seum, and enlisting' for it their active co-operation;
in favor of the creation of international courts of ar
bitration; urging the construction of an isthmian
canal on the Western Hemisphere at the earliest prac
ticable-moment; favoring the free exchange of art
and artistic works between nations; and calling atten
tion of capital to the opportunity for the formation of
new international transportation lines. .
The publication of the volume shows the compre
hensive manner in which: the Philadelphia Museum
carries on its work, and will doubtless serve as a
stimulus to: the merchants and manufacturers of this
coast in promoting the Pacific Commercial Museum.
It is. In fact, a notable volume, and one which clearly
marks the beginning of the new era in our commer
cial development
A BAD USE OF THE COURTS.
SUPERINTENDENT HESS, who was brought
from the East to assist in organizing the so
called relief department of the Southern Pacific
Company, is reported by the Chronicle of yesterday to
have given reasons why employes of the road should
accept the terms of relief offered by the road instead
oi relying upon the courts to sustain them in their
lawful rights. In the course of the interview Mr.
Hess is quoted as saying:
"Let us take the case, for instance, of an employe
who is killed. We will say he leaves a wife and sev
.eral children. If the widow is content with the bene
fits which her husband's membership in the relief de
partment entitle her to she will immediately receive
the amount of his death benefit, and would have to
pay no doctors' bills, which, if her husband's death
were preceded by a period of illness, would otherwise
be quite large. If she is not content with these bene
fits and sues the company she will lose all that is corn
ins to her from the relief department and may be
dependent on friends for her living and that of her
children for a considerable period. Her case might
drag along in the courts for several years, and if she
finally secured a judgment you don't suppose the
company would pay it. do you? Railroad companies
don't like to pay judgments in damage suits. The case
would be appealed, and it might be years before she
recovered from the company. By the time she did
get a settlement the amount would probably be en
tirely eaten up with lawyers' fees and other expenses.
It would be much better for her if she accepted the
benefits offered by the relief department."
That statement presents in a clear light one of the
worst evils of corporation tyranny â that of making
the courts serve the purposes of injustice and wrong.
It will be noted that in the case put by. Mr. Hesshe
prants the widow of the employe who was killed has
a right to damages under the law, nor does he deny
the justice of the law, but .asserts that despite the
right and the justice on the side of the widow the
corporation would refuse to pay damages, would take
appeals from one court to another, prolong litiga
tion for years, knowing it was going to be defeated in
the end. but taking satisfaction in the knowledge that
lawyers' fees and other expenses would have "eaten
up" the widow's portion before the end came.
This practice of resorting to the courts and to pro
lrrncjed litigation to defeat the laws of the land has
become a settled policy on the part of aggressive cor
porations. We have an example of it in the course
taken by Wells- Fargo Express Company in shirking
the taxes imposed by the war revenue bill. Suits in
which the right of the corporation to impose a stamp
taoc upon shippers is involved have been heard by the
courts again and a^ain. and in every instance judg
ment has been given against the company; still the
corporation continues to shirk the tax upon the pub
lic and to force a new lawsuit whenever a shipper pro
tests against the wrong.
' It i? clear that in this practice on the part of cor
porations we have an evil for which remedial legisla
tion should be provided. It should not be left in the
power of wealthy corporations to defeat justice by
making its attainment so costly and so difficult that
â¢icrsons of ordinary fortune cannot achieve it. When
seriously considered there will be found something to
<=tir indipnation in the mind of every just man in this
outspoken declaration of the railroad official that even
when a widow has a pood claim against the corpora
tion her rights will be fought in court after court *o
that "by the time she did get a settlement the amount
would be entirely eaten up by lawyers' fees and other
expenses."
It v;o:iW be well for the Judpes themselves to give
herd' to the bad use which the corporations are thus
mnkirj? of the courts. Our tribunals were established
?n maintain and do justice, not to defeat it: to up
hold law. not to afford a means of evading it
The report that the Dutch are thinking of- asking
annexation to the German empire as a means of es
caping British rapacity is a very good story in its
way, but the Hollanders will not surrender indepen
dence for the sake of avoiding danger until they have
degenerated a long way from what their ancestors

HOW ARE. THE MIGHTY FALLEN.
It. is a matter of comment that Mayor
Phelan's . name is beginning to be missed
from newspapers. Tnere was a time, not
so long ago, when his Honor's portrait or
patronymic appeared on Â¦ almost every
page, till men marveled that he could
stand the strain of so much celebrity. The
other day the Examiner contained a page
report of the Board of Supervisors'- meet
ing, and in the four columns of small
print, a microscope could not reveal the
name of Phelan even once. Before Esola
was turned down it would have been
strewn all over the page. His Honor has
not endeared himself to the Examiner,
we should think, by resurrecting that old
scandal of the Monarch's World's Fair
edition when the railroad company was
stood up for $3(ViOO and the gas company
for $2500. It appears from Mr. Crockett's
reply to his Honor at the board meeting
that the Examiner demanded $5000. but
got only half that r -icunt. His Honor
made it appear that he was trying to sad
dle the scandal on The Call and was sur
prised when It suddenly transpired that
his old journalistic ally was the free
booter. But was he surprised?!

APPLICATIONS FILED
FOR POLICE PENSIONS
Ex-Commissioners Tobin and AJvord
Take Advantage of Act of the- V
Legislature.
Secretary Cadwalader of the Police
Commission was greatly surprised last
Saturday when he received two applica
tions for pensions signed by ex-Police
Commissioners Robert J. Tobin and Wil
liam ' Alvord. The applications were, ac
companied by a letter written by Attorney
Joseph Dunne, stating that he was acting
for Tobin and Alvord and requesting that
the applications be taken up at the earli
est possible moment.
' Both applications were - written on the
regular blanks and were drawn up in legal
form to the effect that the petitioners ap
plied for a pension under the provisions of
section 3 of an act of the Legislature of
California to create a police relief,: health
and life Insurance fund In the several
counties of the State, approved March,
1899,' and they conclude as' follows:
I am over 60 'years 'of age and was duly ap
pointed, sworn and qualified as a member of
the regularly constituted Police Department of
San Francisco, . with the rank of Police Com
missioner, from April 9, 1878, Â¦ until IS9B, com
prising a period of twenty years. . I never re
signed, nor was I dismissed from said Police
Department. Wherefore I respectfully pray
that I be granted such pension as Police Com
missioner.
Tobin recites that he has been tweny
five years in the department. His salary
as president of the commission was $250
per month, and according to the statute
he will, if his claims are recognized, re
ceive $125 a month as a pension. Alvord's
salary was $100 a month and his pension
will be, sso a month.- When Alvord was
seen last night he stated, that he . had
acted In accordance with -the advice of
his attorney and that he thought he was
legally entitled to the benefits of the pen
sion law after having served faithfully
during the past twenty-two years in the
department. Tobin.vwas of the opinion
that â¢ the legislative act -applied to the
Commissioners as well ' as to their sub
ordinates.
Police Commissioner Mahoney was thun
derstruck when he was informed of the
applications. He was not prepared to say
what action would be taken. .The matter
will come up regularly before the Police
Relief and Pension Commission, of which
he and his three colleagues are ex-offlclo
members. No meeting has as yet been
held by the latter body, but one will be
called In the near future. :

THE RAIN IN SEASON.
UP to this time the season has been about as pro
pitious to farmers and fruit and vine growers
as any within the memory of man. The raiiis
of the autumn and winter were abundant and timely,
and were followed by a period of: uninterrupted sun
shine long enough to allow for plowing, planting and
all other, forms. of winter cultivation. Now, with the
spring, new rains have come in such measure as to
insure the crops against all danger of. injury by
drought. :.;Â¦',
One of the most gratifying features of the recent
showers is the fact that they have fallen with consid
erable profusion in' nearly all parts of the State. Even
in the sou\hern counties, where there has been a bad
lack of moisture for some time, the recent rains ap
pear to be fairly abundant. Reports from Los An
geles are to the effect that the showers in that vicinity
on Sunday gave a fall of nearly an inch, and that,
while they came too late to be of much benefit to the
wheat and the barley crops, they have assured an
abundant yield of hay and potatoes. From San
Diego the reports are that in all parts of the county
there was a generous downpour, and that thousands
of acres of grain have been saved by it.
Taking the whole country south of Tehachapi gen
erally, the rains appear to have brightened the, pros
pects of all rural industries and given promise of
vast benefits. It is therefore not "surprising to learn
that the' hearts of farmers and of business men have
been gladdened by their coming, and that therenow
prevails throughout the south. a sanguine expectation
of a prosperous business year. >.
In other parts of the State there is no longer any
doubt of the crops except such as may possibly be
injured by late frosts. The Tains were, in fact, not
needed in many localities owing to the abundant
showers of the winter, but in others they came in the
nick of time to give late sown grain a good start: In
the mining counties the fall has of course been doubly
welcome, for even when the agriculturists of those
localities are not in need of it, rain is always. welcome
to the miners.
THE REBUKE OF A FRIEND IS KIND
THE Humboldt Standard republishes and â¢. ap
proves very strongly a recent Call editorial in
behalf of- maintaining the Republican doctrine
of protection to the American schedule of wages and
the American standard of life. Our Eureka friend
calls this "a sign of returning reason" in The Call,
and suggests that "it continue its work along this
line. It has said so much already against expansion;
ii has arraigned the administration for its Philippine
policy so frequently, that it is high time for it to
stand in line and fight the common enemy. Carnegie,
Bryan, Belmont, Altgeld. Tillman and the rest of the
aggregation are in the. field to defeat McKinley and
turn protection down. The paper which professes to
be a Republican organ cannot afford to give these
men aid and comfort in their scheme by denouncing
any principle for which the administration stands.
Let The Call stick to the position above stated and
it may undo a part of the mischief it has already done
by standing in with the Atkinsons, Pettigrews, Alt
gelds and Tillmans of Democracy on the Philippine
question."
The rebuke of a friend is kind, but we wish the
friend were a more attentive reader of The Call. If
he will go back to the beginning of this issue, which
aiose upon the annexation of Hawaii, he will be
pleased to discover that we opposed tropical expan
sion because it would involve imperialism, or the
inevitable competition of coolie and servile labor with
the. American workingman, to the loss of his wages
and the degradation of his standard of life. From
our columns can be compiled a textbook of accurate
facts upon that subject We warned the Republican'
party and the country of what was coming. We
pointed out fundamental errors in the .Republican
position, which were sure to precipitate -upon the
country in the.campaign of this year a series of most
afflicting questions. These torments are nowupon
us. It is not our fault that the President recom
mended free trade with Porto Rico,. and that the Re
publican party had to bolt from his policy and put a
tariff wall between that island and American labor.
It is not our fault that this bolt broke the integrity
of the Republican majority in the House, and gal
vanized the Bryan Democracy into the first sign of
life it has shown since it knocked jtg own brains out
in the Chicago convention. It is not our fault that
Congressman Littlefield of Maine, and the v - Republi
cans who stood with him for the free trade recom
mendation of the President, were denounced as bolt
ers from protection by their colleagues in the House.
It will not be our fault if all Republicans fail to
stand together to re-elect this administration, retain
control of Congress and reach a sane and safe basis
for legislation, to extricate the country from the con
sequences, which we foretold, of the follies into which
it has gone astray.
In January we advised that Congress refrain from
legislation as to our external burdens, cast, upon us
by the Spanish war. We warned the party that the
subjects were too imperfectly understood to make
such legislation wise, and that to attempt it would re
veal party division. The result in the case of Porto
Rico has proved the soundness of our advice. Surely
the Humboldt Standard was not edified, by the spec
tacle of a Presidential recommendation overridden by
his part}', and the chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee forted to acutely turn upon his own sol
emn utterances and vote against what he had declared
to be the solemn duty of the party? .
We beg to advise the Standard that a few feet of
foresight is worth miles of regret, and that the sole
glimmer of hope in the Bryan party has been lighted,
not by anything we have done, but by doing what we
advised should be omitted. The responsibility is upon
those who have supplied Atkinson, Pettiprew et als.
with an issue in which the Porto Rico bill proved that
they have the sympathy of Dingley's successor, and
a sufficient number of Republicans in the .House to
compel a humiliating compromise as the price of hold
ing the party majority. If the Standard think it good
politics to see the Democratic minority in the House
upholding the President's recommendation and quot
ing his message against the position of the Republican
majority, we must differ.
We ask now, and will ask again, that legislation on
these external possessions be held in abeyance, and
that the part}' platform favor a calm study of all phy
sical and political conditions therein before action. is
had.

L LIQUID ATEL
(Concluded.)
The Absolute Zero.
As the work upon the liquefaction of
gases proceeded, experimenters were
brought to ' a more and more Intimate
knowledge of conditions which had been
matters of mathematical demonstration
rather than of experience. The measure
ment of these conditions was very diffi
cult. The properties of substances in this
extreme cold were unknown and a great
field of research was at once opened.
As heat consists in the energy of mo
tion of the molecules of a body, the Idea
at once presents itself that the point
might be reached, theoretically at least,
where the molecules, having lost their
energy of motion little by little as th*
temperature was reduced, had' been
brought to rest. Such a point would mark
the limit of cold and a body at that tem
perature would possess no heat at all.
This point, for obvious reasons, is known
as the "absolute zero." Its value Is de
termined, by means of the relation be
tween expansion of gases and tempera
ture, to lie between 273 degrees and 274
degrees below the zero of the centigrade
scale. Logically, all temperatures should
be. reckoned from that point, as. Indeed,
for many practical purposes, they are.
Now, with all known gases liquefied, w*
are getting wonderfully near to this point.
Just how near Is aa yet. somewhat a mat
ter of inference. All ordinary thermome
ters fall. Even the air Â¦ thermometer is
frozen solid and the hydrogen thermome
ter is of little use. Electrical methods
are doubtful because nobody knows Just
bow the electrical properties of substances
vary at such temperatures. Dewar, with
liquid hydrogen, has obtained a tempera
ture within about 21 degrees of the abso
lute zeroâ some 280 degrees centigrade or
more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit colder
than the temperature of an ordinary,sum
mer day; and solid hydrogen Is about 5
degrees centigrade colder yet. It will be
Interesting to relate, so far as they are
yet known, some of the properties of sub
stances at these low temperatures.
Properties of Liquefied Gases.
The beautiful experiments which It Is
possible to perform before an audience
with liquid air In quantity have become
well known. All ordinary liquids are
frozen. Alcohol . becomes ice, mercury a
solid so hard that it will drive nails. . A
Jet of carbon dioxide gas falls as snow;
and to make the liquid air boll violently
it Is only necessary to set a kettle of It
upon a cake of ice. In spite of this, liquid
air is kept for hours In unsealed cans, in
which evaporation is comparatively slow.
For the rarer liquefied gnses. in small,
quantities, Dewar has devised the vacuum
flask. The liquid oxygen or hydrogen, or
whatever It may be. is In the Inner ves
sel, and the space between that and the
outer flask is exhausted, the two flasks
being sealed together at the neck. It is
found that the evaporation Is only about
one-fifth as rapid as ; when this space is
filled with- air; rS?-** -
Under such conditions air may be seen
as a clear, colorless liquid when pure, or
as a transparent solid when very cold.
The solid air at higher temperature , is
characterized as a . nitrogen Jelly, from
which a strong magnet will draw the oxy-

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.

considering have a very marked effect
upon the properties of familiar materials
and upon chemical action. Wires of metal
are made much more hard and brittle and
their tensile strength is Increased. Rub
ber, cork and such substances are as hard
as stones, and organic substances of all
kinds are frozen solid. Chemical action is
very miÂ»;h diminished or ceases alto
gether and the action of light on photo
graphic films Is very weak.
Upon living organisms the effects of
very low temperature are various. Cold
blooded animals show but slight resist
ance, while warm-blooded animals resist
surprisingly well until the resources of
the body are exhausted. Few insects can
resist very low temperatures, although
snails were subjected to a temperature of
â120" without apparent Injury. Bacteria,
unfortunately, seem to be unaffected by
the lowest temperature to which they
have been exposed. â 213* C. Possibly later
experiments at â250" to â 2W may show
a different result. The beneficial effect of
the cold bath is well recognised; but prob
ably no one, before Pictet. ever advocated
one quite so cold as 110 s below zero centi
grade. By the cautious use of an air bath
at this temperature he cured himself of
chronic indigestion of long standing, and
a "cold well" constructed under his super
vision was afterward in use by many peo
ple, i -
The effect of low temperatures on th*
germinating power of sÂ«eds has twice
been tried, once at â182" C, and again,
within the last few months, at â252* C. In
the more recent experiment a number of
seeds of different types were exposed to
the temperature of liquid hydrogen.
Some of. each were, cooled slowly, and
kept for more than an hour In a sealed
tube immersed in the hydrogen. The oth
ers were not .so carefully treated. In
transmitting the second packet of seeds
for planting, Dewar wrote: **I have sent
you seeds to-day which. If the treatment
with cold can kill, ought to be dead. They
have been Immersed in liquid hydrogen
for upward of rtx hours and no attempt
was made to graduate the coollnnr. â¢ â¢ â¢
The seeds have been soaked In liquid hy
drogen." The seeds showed no trace of
their hard- experience and all sprouted.
This experiment Is particularly Interesting.
as the temperature to which the seeds wers
exposed is very nearly as low as that of
the great Interstellar spaces, and their
survival lends additional weight to the
idea that life may originally have beÂ«n
brought to the earth on some seed-bearinc
meteorite.
Industrial Applications of Low Tem
peratures.
Now. of what use In all this? First.
much has been added to the store of hu
man knowledge. Utility from thÂ© scient
ist's point of view Is not the highest aim â
probably few of the men who have devot
ed years and great labor to this work
would have. tolled so long or so patiently
for something merely useful. But to most
people utility is now the main question.
A, few of the possible uses of the great
development In this direction nave no
doubt suggested themselvea. Very cold
substances may be as useful as very hot
bodies in certain operations in medicine)
or surgery, cautery for example, and no
one can predict to what extent low tem
peratures can be used beneficially In the
treatment of disease.
Next, cold, under control. Is a market
able article. The extent to which lique
fied gases are used for this purpose de
pends only upon the cost of producing
tnem. A substance as cold as liquid hy
drogen produces In a few seconds about
the most perfect vacuum known, by freez
ing out ail the contents of the chamber to
be exhausted. When these solidified gases
have fallen to the bottom the empty
chamber can be sealed off above them.
Liquefied gases might be used as explo
sives,- either alone, to operate by natural
expansion, or mixed with other substances
and fired. A liquefied gas confined in a
closed vessel and exposed to ordinary,
temperatures would soon.be heated abova
its critical temperature, and the expansive
force of the substance, which could at
longer remain liquid, would be great.

DAMROSCH ON MUSIC
AND ART OF WAGNER
Cultured Audience Enjoys the First
Lecture and Recital of the
Series.
A goodly audience, composed chiefly of
ladies, attended Walter Damrosch's first
explanatory recital at Sherman, Clay &
Co.'s Hall yesterday forenoon. The un
qualified success of the affair Is gratify
ing to note, for It bespeaks an Interest in
the higher music that is la every way a
credit to the community.
The lecture was pleasantly instructive,
though rather more popular than techni
cal, and throughout tne charming person
ality of Mr. Damrosch, his engaging man
ner and indisputable authority, ' held the
attention of his auditors and won their
approbation.
Damrosch goes far to overcome the dif
ficulties of adequately interpreting on the
piano the intricacies of the Wagnerian
BCore and his admirably executed illustra
tions form a most' pleasant accompani
ment to his lecture.
The theme of yesterday's recital was
"Das Rhelngold," the prelude to the
"Niebelungen Trilogy." The first opera of
the Ring was composed by Wagner dur
ing his exile in Zurich, it was then at
the age of 35 that the composer, having
lost pitlence with the false standards of
art that were practiced in the construction
of opera, developed his preconceived Ideas
of the importance of the dramatic factor
in musical expression. Instead of sacrific
ing this factor to melody he undertook to
make it the basis of his new scheme of
the music-drama, and perfected the ex
pression of the significant and vital ele
ments in the leit-motifs which form the
framework of his marvelous creations.
The elucidation of these leit-motifs and
their significance in the opera of "Das
Rheingold" were the subject of Mr. Dam
rosch's discourse and his illustrations of
the themes, their development and modi
fication were delightfully set fourth.
He spoke of the essential simplicity of
the various leit-motifs and of how by the
various chord-combinations and theme
comblnatlons and the wonderful contra
puntal" development with which the com
poser treated them they became the ve
hicle of a perfect dramatic expression.
Commenting upon the necessity of giving
specific titles to the themes, such as
tne "Rhelngold Theme." the "renuncia
tion of love theme," etc.. Mr. Damrosch
said: "The music should impress Itself
upon one without the aid of words to dis
tinguish its various meanings. One should
therefore remember the names of the va
rious themes a short time and then for
get them as speedily as possible.
The remaining recitals of the series will
take place at Sherman, Clay & Co.'s Hall
at 3:30 p. m. instead of 11 o'clock in the
morning. The dates and subjects are as
follows:. "Wednesday, March 7, "Die
Walkuere"; Saturday. March 10, "Sieg
fried": Monday, March 12. "Gotterdam
merune"; Wednesday, March 14. "Parsi

A Few Useful Rules.
1. The French use small letters in spell
ing the names of months, seasons, etc,;
aÂ»-o the first person "Je" (I) is, contra ry
to the English, spelled with a small letter,
unless it commences a sentence. ,
2. The student may profitably begin to
read aloud now. This he will find is the
only way of familiarizing himself with the
vocabulary. Students must make It a
point to use the tongueâ that is to say,
speak as much as possible. The more and
the oftener they will speak and read the
surer they will be of success.

"DOC" LEAHY IS
OFF AFTER THE
MUSICAL STARS
To Italy to Secure Artists
for. the Season of Grand
Opera.
Avedano and Salassa to Return With
. Other Great Singers and a
i Repertoire of New
Operas.
"Doc" Leahy,*- the genial manager of
the Tivoli, la getting ready his steamer
trunk and traveling rugs preparatory far
his annual run over to musical .Italy. As
usual, ."Doc" is not traveling for, pleas
ure. He has several big enterprises up
his sleeves, and the contracts he will
carry over to the land of music will on
his return be ornamented with the signa
tures of people famous In musical cen
ters. Â¦
The object of Leahy's trip Is to put the
finishing touches -to the almost already
completed arrangement for the season. of
grand opera at. the Tivoli. which begins
the first Monday in August. Leahy goes
straight to Miilan, where Avedano and Sa
lassa, the marvelous successes of. last
year's season, are eagerly waiting to con
clude the arrangements which will bring
them again to the Tivoli boards. Three
other big men are to be signedâ a lyric
tenor, a barytone and basso â and a cele
brated dramatic soprano. Leahy has sev
eral people in his mind's eye, but the ulti
mate choice will not be made until "Doc"
reaches the other side. Miss Schuster,
the lyric soprano who has done such ex
cellent work In other Tivoli seasons of
grand opera, will be the diva of the pres
ent season; and to prepare for the ardu
ous duties of eight weeks of grand opera
Mlsa Schuster will retire from the Tlvali
cast at the close of the run of "The Idol' 3
Eye," to rest and recuperate, with Miss
Frances Graham, now also a member of
the Tivoli company. Critical "Doc"
hopes to surprise San Francisco music
lovers. Miss Graham, who, by the way,
is a Native Daughter, has a marvelous
contralto voice of wonderful range and
will be given a chance to show the stuff
she Is made of.
As usual. "Alda," the good show-off
opera, that gives the public a taste of
what they may expect in the way of
principals, chorus, orchestra and mis-en
scene, will be the opening opera. The
other operas to follow are "Andrea Che
nier." "Hamlet," "La, Navaralse," "Fal
staft" and possibly "La Tosca," besides
all of last year's great successes.
Great things are promised for Salassa
in "Hamlet, the wonderful barytone's
greatest creation. Salassa and Avedano
will also be heard In "Tannhauser" and
"Lohengrin," their first appearance In
Wagnerian roles in America.

the other was an anti-billboard ordinance,
about which there has also been consider
able talk. The latter was Introduced by
Supervisor Tobln, who took pains to say
that his object was not to befriend the
newspapers.
"The newspapers are able to take carÂ©
of themselves," said the Supervisor, "and
my only object In introducing this or
dinance is to improve the appearance of
the city." Tho ordinance is as follows:
Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any per
son, firm or corporation to erect, build, con
struct or maintain in the city and county of
San Francisco any fence, building or other
Etructure of a greater height than ten feet
from the street, sidewalk or ground, where the
mmc is erected, built, constructed or main
tained for the purpose of painting thereon any
sign or advertisement for advertising purposes,
or posting thereon, or fixing or attaching there
to or thereon, any bills, signs or other adver
tising matter for advertising purposes. .
Sec. 2. Any person, firm or corporation vio
lating any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall be punched by a fine of not more than
1100 or by Imprisonment in the County Jail not
more than thirty days. . â¢
Sec. 3. All â¢ orders, ordinances or parts of
orders and ordinances In conflict with this
ordinance are hereby repealed.
Sec. 4. This ordinance shall take effect and
be in effect from and after its passage and
approval.
Supervisor Brandensteln questioned the
legality of the ordinance In the shape In
which It was drawn and on his motion It
was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
Health Board Appropriation.
The two resolutions appropriating $20,000
and $8000 for me expenses of the Health
Department for the last six months of the
present fiscal year were indefinitely post
poned. A substitute resolution, prepared
as an economic measure, appropriating
$24,000 for the board, will be adopted at
the next meeting.
The Olympic Club will not be compelled
to pay a license of $1000 In order to hold
its boxing and wrestling tournament, as
provided in. the ordinance imposing
licenses on boxing clubs. The matter
came up on an amendment offered by Su
pervisor Comte providing that the Olym
pic and similar amateur organizations be
granted a license to give exhibitions of
boxing, etc., upon the payment of an an
nual fee of $100. President William Greer
Harrison of- the Olympic Club addressed
the board .tnd pointed out the hardship
the payment of a $1000 license would im
pose on amateur organizations and the
amendment was passed to print without
opposition.
The board adopted a resolution directing
the Auditor to investigate the matter of
duplicate payments of taxes and for sums
paid in excess to the Tax Collector, to
ascertain whether such moneys have been
paid into the treasury by the Tax Col
lector and if the same have not been paid
and sufficient evidence is presented by the
petitioner to show a just claim to demand
of the Tax Collector that such moneys be
paid by him into the treasury that a de
mand for the amount may be drawn upon
the Treasurer, payable to such persons
holding proper receipts therefor.
A resolution was also adopted In rela
tion to the applications of persons claim
ing to have paid taxes on property upon
the real and personal property rolls, to
the effect that if the Auditor find the
same has not been properly posted to the
credit of the property and that said
moneys were paid into the treasury, he
Is directed to submit to the Supervisors
for approval a demand on the treasury in
favor of the Tax Collector for said sums,
the same to be posted by the Tax Col
lector to the credit of the property of the
petitioner.
A communication was received from the
Auditor calling attention to the fact that
it has heretofore been the custom for the
Tax Collector to sign receipts with a rub
ber stamp, which action the Auditor con
siders Illegal, and suggesting that the Tax
Collector be directed to sign receipts here
after in writing. Referred to judiciary
Committee.
Scheme Declared Illegal.
A communication was received from
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
Lane giving his opinion In the matter of
holding back the June salaries of em
ployes until after July 1, same to be paid
out of funds of the next fiscal year. The
City Attorney says there is no authority
for such action under the new charter
and he holds that it would be illegal.
The City and County Attorney also ad
vised the Supervisors that the acceptance
by the city of the sum of $7327 50 tendered
by the London and San Francisco Bank
could In no way injure the suit of the city
for an additional amount: The grder au
thorizing partial payment of disputed
taxes was thereupon referred to the Ju
diciary Committee.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March B.â Attention In the
â¢tock market continued to be largely diverted
to the feverish and excited fluctuations of a
â¢mall number of stocks. Manipulation by the
boars was largely responsible for the changes.
In the case of Sugar the operations of the
professional traders were Interrupted by the
unexpected artlon of the directors In declaring
a <iuarterly dividend of 1% per cent on - the
common etock. This sudden tearing aside of
the veil of mystery rather nonplused the pro
fessional traders, who had counted upon a
period of uncertainty until Wednesday In
which to circulate vague tips and to keep up
Â¦n excited fluctuation In the stock with op
portunities for profit both up and down. The
cutting la half of the dividend was about
what Wall street sentiment had settled upon.
Hut coming suddenly upon the half-executed
plans of the sj>eculatlve contingent It left
them all Â«t sea. The stock opened under
l>resÂ«ure. but after falling nearly 2 points en
<-<tunterrd vigorous mipport and was rallied to
]05'/S by noon.. A 2000-share lot was taken at
that price when the news became known of
the dividend sx-tlon. Enormous Felling for both
accounts Immediately followed >n< i t r Â» price
â¢slumped by wide breaks with occasional spas
modic rallies to 97. Fluctuations were wild on
the recovery to par. The flood of-offeringi pre
vented the rise above, but on the reaction to
â¢ft large buying was again in evidence, which
rallied It to SÂ»'i. where it closed with a net
)oiÂ«s of 1%. In the half-hour after midday
iranractlor.s In this fingle stock reached the
enormous ascresratc of 62.000 shares. ' There
â¢were sharp breaks la Tobacco and TenneÂ«Â»ee
Â«.oal at the rninw time with the slump In
Hujf*r. but the general market was not af
â¢erte-!. In fart the stock market gave evi
dence cf its relief over the settlement of this
Â«.i.Â«turljing question by a smart rally, many
<r the railroad stocks rising to the best prict-s
of the day. The market was again unsettled
la the late dealing* by an attack on Steel
Ilor/p People's Gas and Consolidated Oag, <j r j v .
ing them down 1 to 4 points. New York Cen
tral reacted 1%. but otherwise the railroad list
was a little active and retained a fair sprinkling
Â«l net gains. Third Avenue, after having
risen to LS% was forced down to U In the late
dealings and Tennessee Coal also yielded to
pressure. A quotation of SH per cent was
made for call money In the coty-ae of the late
bear raid on stocks. The money market dur
ing the <!ay showed no sign of disturbance and
there was no evidence of liquidation being
forced by the calling of loans. There was not
a factor In this market.
The bond market was rather doll and Ir
regular. Total eales, par \alue, Â»i; 760.000.
United States bond* were unchanged In bid
quotations. '

A! 1 supplies were firmly held up to quotations,
Â¦nd dealers exprersed full confidence In the
future. OenÂ»ral conditions are Improving
slowly, and there are Indications of a much
better market in the near future. Every va
riety Is firmly held, and holders are dleln
rlined to ehade prices any longer, believing
that the upward turn which has already be
gun will cause an Increase in quotations within
a few days.
"The rale of outside prunes noted yesterday.
which cleans up about everything of that sort
Evailable. has had the effect of strengthening
the market and may F^nd prices up a notch
en some of those which have ruled low dur
ing the season. There Is more Inquiry from
Â¦!1 quarters, even large sizes attracting more
attention than hitherto. Small sizes are firmer,
and there is a strong upward tendency to the
market, without, however, any quotable ad-
â¢â¢Raisins continue quiet, though there ap
pear* to be pon;e disposition to hold prices
firmer on some varieties, and buyers find It
:.<â¢ r^srv to make better offers to secure

â¢Out of the mass of discussion which
has been accummulated since March 1.
tne railroad employes bave evolved a
tpeciUc line of action. They do not pro
pobc to denounce tne company from the
public platform. There will be no public
Lass meetings. Such a course, the men
ueclaxfe, would accomplish nothing but to
furnish targtits at wnlch the company
could fire snould there bÂ« dissatisfaction
over the 6tand their employes take.
"The men have decided to go directly to
headquarters with their grievances. To
this end, the brotherhoods and orders are
organizing their representatives in select
committees. Railroad men at West Oak
land announce that they 'do not propose
to so before the public -with their com
jlaints, but place them directly, , in a reg
ular way, before the men In authority.
Ksxh organization has a- standing griev
ance committee. This committee will "be
supplemented by special committees, and
the whole will comprise the representative
body, which will go before the general
manager. Â¦
Faith in McKenzie.
As an opening wedge the men have had
laid before Division Superintendent Agler
and Master Mechanic McKenzle 6ome of
tbe reasons why they are opposed to the
insurance scheme. It is expected that
these olacials will present a report to the
general office concerning the temper of
the men under their control on the West
ern division. Master Mechanic McKenzie
is expected ro have much weight with his
supt-riors. because he is known to be one
of tl"> fairest heads of departments in the
<*<jmpar:y'6 employ. He holds the confi
der.ee of rhe men, who for years have
found him a mediator in their troubles
with the company.
So far as the future attitude of the sev
eral thousand employes of the company
In Oakland is concerned much depends

action of the last resort. 'Many of them
op*T.ly dccl tre that to strike would be
a stfji or.ly warranted by the deliberate
refusal' of the company to {rive heed to
their obiÂ«Â»cilons, but the spirit of contest
15 ahfoad. because the men feel so strong
ly that the "relief bureau" is only an
other name for a club to smash their or
ganizations. Their fight will be to in
due*Â» the company to either abandon the
',<ijectior.able scheme or to modify it in
t-uch a way ttyit the men will not feel
i impelled to take up the proposition. They
propose through their committees to make
a thorough . presentation of their argu
ment before the penera! manager. To this
ted -the most prominent and influential
men in each department will be used on
ihKs rnmmlllws.
The engineers, conductors. ' firemen, all
oihf-r tralnmtn, as well as yard and shop
employes, are practically a unit in op
pr>ping th* 1 scheme. Here and there an
<'d<i rran or two has held out in favor of
the" insurance plan, but the number is so
hmall that no weight is attached to their
!-land.' ?Â¦- --
Crisis May Be Delayed.
Present indications are that the crisis
in th*> conflict will not be reached for
several month*. The. men are willing- to
await thtr result of the numerous confer
Â« ncrs which are scheduled. The employes
think that ' thÂ»=-y may win 'out with the
company by fhe exprt?Â«ion through im
mediate superiors of.thf-ir almost unani

in this, they next.- propose to send their

Fbould this step fall to move the railroad

Sunset Telephone Company
Breaks Faith With
* Alameda County.
County Expert Bullock Exposes Cor
' poration's Greediness to Collect
for Switches That Were
to Be Free. :?-Â¦?Â£
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, "March 5.
Colonel E. B. Bullock, the county's ex
pert, has thrown a bombshell Into the
camp of the Sunset Telegraph and Tele
phone Company. He has unearthed a
contract by the terms of which he clearly
proved to the Board of Supervisors to
day that thÂ« telephone monopoly has Il
legally mulcted Alameda County In the
Bum of $260 60 for switches from the Coun
ty Infirmary telephone, when, as a matter
of fact, a contract exists allowing
switches free of charge.
The corporation will not be pleased to
learn that the discovery of its brazen
greediness was made- by the county ex
pert through a 5-cent switch charge for
an order sent by telephone from the In
firmary to Joseph Herscher's grocery at
San Leandro for a Jar of molasses.
The following report .was submitted to
the Board of Supervisors to-day by Ex
pert Bullock, and proved so clearly self
explanatory that there waa hardly any
discussion and the matter was referred
to Chairman Roeth of the Finance Com
mittee and Expert Bullock to further in
vestigate and adjust.
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors
of Alameda Countyâ Gentlemen: 1 wish to call
your attention to the following facts regarding
the telephone claims against the County In
firmary. In the flret place, the minutes of the
board show the following: April -4, 1892â "A
contract was received from the Sunset Tele
graph and Telephone Company to put in a tele
phone In the County Infirmary for $10 per
month, all switches for county business to tje
free. On motion of Supervisor D. W. Martin
the chairman was authorized to sign the con
tract." .
, The contract was signed, and for that year
only $10 per month was paid. In talking with
Mr. Fleming, the superintendent of the com
pany, he stated that it ! was their custom to
make contracts for a year, and when they run
out to continue at the same terms. But I find
that "custom" did not prevail In this case, as
you will see by the following charges for
switches: In ISP3, J2S 43; 1894, $16 35; 1895, $30 40;
1596, $34 10; 1Â«97. $34 75; IS9S, Â»60 10; 1599. $38 45;
total, $260 60, charged in excess of the $10 per
month as per contract. All of the above claims
have been oald to the company, with the ex
ception of November and December, 1539, which
I hold pending an adjustment of same. Very
respectfully, E. E. BULLOCK.
County Expert.
"I discovered the Illegal switch charge
by mere chance," said Expert Bullock
afterward. "I had noticed recently that
5-cent charges were being made for
switches to San Leandro and other near
by places. On investigating one of these
charges I found that a 5-cent switch had
been charged the County Infirmary for a
telephone message to Herscher's grocery
for a Jar of molasses. Naturally, I con
cluded to look up the contract. I was
very much - surprised to find that . the
county had contracted to pay $10 per
month for the infirmary 'phone and have
all switches for county business free' of
charge. Well, an order for molasses' to
be delivered at the County Inflrmary": is
clearly county business,- and so I. reported
the matter."
in another report Expert Bullock sub
mitted to the Supervisors for rejection
claims presented by Coroner Mehrmann
to the amount of $198, most of which had
been charged for illegal $2 interment fees.
These the board promptly rejected, and
it Is understood that $106 collected by the
Coroner during the first three months of
last year on the same account he has
agreed to return to the county treasury.

SOUTHERN EMPLOYES
WILL REFUSE TO SIGN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES.. March s.â Much unfa
vorable comment Is current among the
employes of the Southern Pacific in Los
Angeles over the proposed new accident
and death benefit scheme of insurance.
The greatest objection arises from the
proposed excessive monthly tax and the
sacrifice of any right to sue the company
for damages. Employes declare that they
will not sign any arbitrary agreement that
would deny heirs or widows the right to
sue where carelessness or neglect could
be charged to the company. The most
objectionable feature is the ironclad for
feiture phrase, which says that the accept
ance of the benefits shall operate as a re
lease to the railroad company from all lia
bilities for damages growing out, of. such
Injury, even though it may have beÂ«n
caused by carelessness, negligence, crim
inal or otherwise. If the measure is
pushed many men may leave the service,
and unless compelled not a corporal's
guard will sign the agreement presented.

amount to $130,000. To this was added for op
erating expenses, as If the entire work of sup
plying the city was to be done by one com

committee begs now. to submit to you contains
such a horizontal reduction of the present

calling for the rendering of the first bill to

flre hydrant rate was left the same as last
year, 12 75 per hydrant monthly, the argu
ment being made by> Chairman Cuvellier
of the committee that the rate was paid
from general taxation and the main pur
pose of the ordinance was to lighten the
burden of the individual ratepayer. . .
The committee's report was signed by
four members â Councilmen Cuvellier,
Baxstow, Meese and Taylor. Explanation
was made that the fifth member. Council
man Upton, was unable to attend â¢ the
meetings of the committee and was com
pelled to be absent at this . evening's
meeting of the Council. The committees
report was In part as follows: .
Report of the Committee.
Guided by the decision of the Supreme Court
In the case of the San Diego Water Company
vs.. the City of San r>le*o, appellants, and af
ter carefully studying the reports made to sev
eral preceding Councils, your committee con
cluded that It was called upon to fix rates only
as for one plant fully capable of supplying
the requirements of the city of Oakland. This
the Contra Costa Water Company's plant has
proven iuelf fully equal to, and, moreover/ it
has been able -to supply water Â¦at the same
time to the other cities and towns of Emery
ville, San Leandro. Berkeley, and also exten
sively to the county. ;
Tour committee has therefore eliminated
from the basis of calculation the Oakland Wa
ter Company's plant, absorbed by the Contra
Costa Water Company, as superfluous, espe
cially this year of all others, after the abun
dant rains and the asserted vast accumulation
of water In the reservoirs of the Contra Coeta
Water Company. Your committee has fixed
the valuation of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's plant at the sum of $3,000,000," and It ar
rived at this figure by taking the value estab
lished according to the Inventory carefully
made by a previous City Council some years
ago and by adding to this the cost of con-
Btruction as taken from the Contra Costa Water
Company's Bworn reports for each subsequent
year, until Its present report, from which lat
ter your committee has strirken out two Items
which cannot properly be considered in this
estimate, to- wit: "Cost of construction of Al
varnfio supply, $13,053," and "Amount paid on
account of purchase of Alameda water plants,
$25,050." . ,-^. v .-: -.Â¦.,;: < .-.
Water Company Compensated. .
In order to compensate the water company for
any possible errors of undervaluation your com
mittee made due allowance by the addttton of a
large and liberal sum. - '
Having thus arrived at a basis of valuation of
13.000,000, your 'committee has sousht to fix
water rates which would yield to thec<tmpany
a fair Income on this, capital and which -would
cover also Its taxes and 1 operating ' expenses.
HAS PLANS FOR
PLAY GROUNDS
Opportunity to Be Given for
Children at Outdoor
Sports.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
\ â¢ 1118 Broadway, March 6.
.The Oakland Club, composed of many of
the society leaders of this city, has taken
up . plans for the .establishment through
out the city of public playgrounds for
children. The scheme Is based upon the
idea that the children should be provided
with means for outdoor recreation In the
form of swings, sandplles and such other
amusements as appeal to ' the infantile
mind. . - -' ' . .
The ladies have had the subject under
careful consideration, note having been
taken of the success of the Columbia
square project in San Francisco. The
Oakland Club has a playground depart
ment, the members or which are prepar
ing a public address . embodying tneir
plans for the consideration of. the phllan
throplcally Inclined persons who are.ex
pected to enlist in behalf of the project.
The playground Is designed to be an out
door gymnasium, with , every facility â¢ for
the entertainment of children in their
youthful sports. The scope of the enter
prise will be limited only by the response
which shall be made to the appeal of the
ladles. The plan comprehends . the selec
tion of portions of public parks to be set
aside for the use of children exclusively
and amply provided ' with paraphernalia
for their games and amusements. - ;.--" '
Among the ladies who are fo3tering the
plans are Mrs. G. W. Bunnell, Dr.- Susan
Fenton, Mrs."C. D.Olney, Mrs. Wickbam
Curtis, Mrs. E. T. 3arber, Mrs. - Mary P.
Mott, Mrs. C. C. Huber. Mrs. Lulu

WELCOME NEWS
FROM THE EAST
Warmly Greeted by Students
as He Steps From Train
at Berkeley.
Reports Formation of the Association
of Universitiesâ Pointers for Pro
posed Commercial Museum
of the Pacific. ;'
BERKELEY, March s.â Benjamin j Ide
Wheeler, president of the University of
California, returned from the East this
evening. He was met at the station by
several hundred students, who welcomed
his coming by numerous college yells.
President Wheeler, has been, away a
month, during which. he has accomplished
a great deal tor the university and for the.
Pacific Coast at large. Besides several
lectures delivered in Richmond and a
number of Informal addresses he spoke
betore the Civic League in Chicago and
made a careful study of the Philadelphia
Commercial Museum.
"I have been so busy during the entire
trfp that it would take hours to tell any
thing of my work," said President
Wheeler to-night. "The most important
matter accomplished, I think, was the or
ganization of an association of .American
universities. The University of California
has been one of the prime movers In the
matter for a long time, and I only put
into effect what has been under discus
sion. This association will be a great
thing. Its sole purpose Is for the ad
vancement of education. . There never
heretofore has existed anything In com
mon between the universities. While all
have aimed at one thing, of course, there
never has been any noticeable assistance
of each other. This association, however,
will give a common basis and make edu
cational work more easily handled.
"In Philadelphia I made a careful study
of the Commercial Museum, particularly
that part of it which will be the most
useful to the Pacific Coast. I have a
great many suggestions to make to the
committee on the promotion of the com
mercial museum of the Â¦ Pacific Coast,
which I cannot make public at this time.
The co-operation of the Philadelphia Mu
seum with the one proposed to be estab
lished here has been promised and no
doubt will be of great assistance to us as
well as to them.
"I was royally . welcomed everywhere,
and all seemed interested In the great new
University of California. 1 I had to repre
sent three' great .universities wherever I
went. Brown, where I graduated; Cor
nell; where I - taught, ..and California all
required special attention. I was re
ceived and dined by graduates of all three
in a number of places. Although I had a
busy trip it was very enjoyable, and I re
turn with renewed energy, determined to
raise California to the highest standard.
"The reception accorded me at the sta
tion by the students was a surprise and
gave me great pleasure to know that there
is a bond of sympathy and loyalty be
tween us." . , .',Â¦-.

Our Increase of Insanity.
â¢ Much discussion has. been aroused lately by
the alarming increase of insanity. Our high
rate of living is the cause assigned. In the

CUNNING CROOKS ROB
A CIGAR-STORE SAFE
', Two, bold crooks successfully carried out
what â¢ was evidently a | well planned rob -
bery last night by abstracting a drawer
containing $72 from -a store safe, with, the
proprietor within reaching. distance.
1. About 10 o'clock last night two young
men entered the cigar store of W. Wil
helmi.at 509. Montgomery street and oae of
them droppeda nickel in the slot machine
at' the end of the counter. The proprietor,
a man 70years } of iage;and almost blind,
got close to the machine to watch it while
the" customer dropped in' all four nickels
into 1 the machine. While the old man's
attention â¢â was .so attracted the second
young man quietly . sneaked , behind the
counter to the back of the store, whf-re
a . small . safe is located, and . pulling out
a drawer sneaked to the front of the store
with the plunder and escaped. His * com
panion disappeared without losing time.
DARKNESS CAUSED
TWO BROKEN LEGS
T. H. Gathe and Adolph Smith
Threaten to Sue the City for
Damages.
The city will probably have to defend
two suits for damages owing to the eco
nomical streak In putting out the street
lights at midnight. :,p'.
Within half an hour of each other two
men were taken to the Receiving Hos
pital early yesterday morning, each with
a broken right leg. ! One was T. H. Gathe.
991 McAllister street, and the other Adolph
Smith, 220 Langton street.
Gathe about 2 o'clock took a young lady
to her home on California and Buchanan
streets. There is a turn on the steps
leading from the sidewalk to the front
door, and after parting with hia compan
ion, Gathe did not see the turn in the
darkness and stepped off into space. His
right leg was badly fractured.
Smith was walking home, and while
passing a building In course of erection
on Mission street, opposite . Annie street,
he stepped into the basement, falling a
distance of about twenty feet. His right
leg was also badly fractured.
. Both declared their intention of , suing
the city for damages, as they say that
if the lights had not. been out the acci
dents would not have occurred. '
A FRANCHISE was applied for yes
terday from the Board of Super
visors of Contra Costa County at
Martinez, in the name of two of the
most prominent financiers and pro
moters of Oakland, that may mean the
entrance of the Atchlson. Topeka and
fcanta Fe Railroad Into Oakland, and
â¢which certainly means a connection be
tween the present terminus of that road
at Point Richmond and that city. The
signers of the application are A. S. Mac
donald, a well-known young promoter
who has done much advance work for the
Santa Fe Railroad, and William G. Hen
shaw. president of the Union Savings
Bank and one of the leading bankers of
Oakland. The petitioners ask for a fran
chise for an electric railroad to run from
the county line between Alameda ana
Contra Costa counties, out San Pablo ave
nue to a point about a mile this side of
the town of San Pablo, thence turning
abruptly westward, crossing the present
main line o( the Southern f acWc Com
cany at Barretts station; thence continu
ing down to Point Richmond, curving
around Point Ricnmona and the Potrero
of San Pablo, making a loup around the
Potrero and running uown on Point Rich
mond itself; tnence running b*ck 10 Sau
Pablo avenue and out to the town of Ban
Pablo, one mile beyond.
Eight Miles in Length.
The terms of the Iranchise axe the usual
ones embooied in sucn documents ana it
is maae 10 cover every motive power ex-
Â£ P 7 *ieam. It is aoout eight miles 111
length aua literally begins nowhere and
enu* nowhere. One loose ena flutters ott
m vie wina at tnts Alameda County line. <
and tne otner winds up at tne old town 01 i
San PaDlo, which was left on a side track
years ago by the Southern Pacittc Com
iany. 'me application was referred to the
usual committee to-day and ordered ad
vertised in accordance with law, so it
will be some weeks before a anal hearing
can be had upon It.
So much for the franchise and the ac
tion upon it. but It Is not so much the
document as it Is the men and the motive
behind it that makes It of interest. Wil
liam G. Henshaw Is interested in a great
many enterprises in Oakland, but they
have all been of a commercial or manu
facturing nature, and he has never dab
bled in railroad schemes and railroad pro
motion. He is one of thesolld men of Oak
land and Is undoubtedly able to construct
euch a line as Is proposed by this fran
chise should he bo wish. .But it Is not
thought that Mr. Henshaw would take a
flyer In electric railroad building unless
he knew what he was doing. This idea Is
further emphasised by the fact that Mr.
Henshaw Is now in New York, and It is
believed that bis visit to that city has
something to do with the. franchise pro
ject which was launched at Martinez to
day. " ?
Looks like the Santa Fe.
It Is more particularly the connection of
A. fl. Macdonald with the scheme, how
ever, that makes It eeem a Santa Fe af-
fair. Mr. Macdonald Is the man who, more
than any -one else, located for the Valley
Railroad Its present line through Franklin
Canyon and who secured for the road its
rights of way to Point Richmond. He was
Intimately connected with the securing of
Roint Richmond^ as a terminus for the
line and did most of the actual
work of securing rights, lands and
property all the way from Antloch. When,
therefore. Mr. Macdonald applies for a
railroad franchise, no matter of what
kind,, it is impossible not to associate the
move with his former line of operations
and believe that it is some kind of a con
necton for the Santa Fe. system and its
Valley Railroad terminus.
The proposed line of the road is regard
ed an the clearest indication that It has
something to do with connecting the end
of the Valley Railroad at Point Richmond
with Oakland. The business between San
Pablo and Oakland will not warrant the
construction of an electric railroad and
It means that this line will connect the
population on this side of the bay with
the terminus of the Valley Railroad at
Point Richmond. -.;:
But whether this new line Is merely a
private enterprise or has some direct con
nection with the terminal plans of- the
.Santa Fe system no one is willing to say.
Mr. Macdonald was seen at his home In
Oakland last night and said:
Will Build Into Alameda.
."William G. Henshaw and myself have
applied for a franchise from, the Contra
Costa County ' Supervisors for an electric
railroad from the Alameda County line
to San Pablo with a loup around the Po
trero of San Pablo and touching Point
Richmond. The application has taken the
usual preliminary course and has not yet
been granted. As for the line stopping at
the boundary between Alameda and Con
tra Costa counties it Is obvious that It
will not do so. We merely applied to the
Contra Costa Supervisors before apply
ing to the Alameda County Supervisors.
When the Contra Costa franchise has
been granted then we will apply for the
end that will be within this county. As
for the road, it will be constructed just
as soon as the franchises are secured and
It will connect Oakland with Point Rlch
.mond and San Pablo, running along Ban
Pablo avenue."
When Mr. Macdonald was ~ questioned
about what the new road represented, or
what was behind it, or whether It was an
entrance into Oakland for the Santa Fe
system, he cheerfully and carefully evaded
a direct answer.
Arranged in New York.
The Indications are that this," franchise
was arranged for before Mr. Henohuw
went East, and that It was to be applied
for in Martinez as soon as Mr. Henshaw
completed the arrangements In New Fork.
These arrangements have evidently been
completed and -the application made upon
telegraphic advices from the East. .That It
is a legitimate scheme there can be not
the slightest doubt from the character of
the two men making the application. That
it may be a Santa Fe terminal scheme
there can be tut little doubt' from- the
same connection.. This offers I vast nros-Â»
pects for. speculation and surmise. ' it 1Â«
said that a vast electric railroad terminal
system is contemplated in- and about Oak
land, of which this is the first ' move, ir

is believed that this Henshaw-Macdonald
road will furnish the entrance into Oak
land from the north t and that it will ab
sorb the Oakland, San Leandro and Hay
wards electric railroad for egress to the
south and Into the Alameda and Santa,
Clara valleys. There have been a number
of large transfers of stock of the Hay
wards road lately, which might mean this
and might mean nothing. This stock haa
been held almost exclusively by A. L.
Stone and his brother. Egbert Stone, and
the Meek family of San Lorenzo, and
there have been few sales until lately.
A. S. Macdonald and. A. L. Stone ara
warm personal friends, and this lends ad
ditional Importance to the electric road
plan which Is mentioned In connection
with the extension of the Santa Fe system
about the bay. Such a system would con
trol not only Oakland, but every town on
the coast side of the Contra Costa hills.
In addition the Haywards line Is the only
independent line in Oakland. All of the
others are controlled either by the South

forth .various reasons for such a law,
among which are the prevention of the

ISCENEOF THE SHOOTING THAT ENDED IN A DOUBLEI
t MURDER. . t
Should the See Yups and Sam Yups com
mence warfare two branches of the former
would have to join with the latter to ac
complish the purposes of the war and it
1b hardly probable that they would take
any such action.
Chief of Police Sullivan was much In
censed when he learned of yesterday's
crimes. He determined to place four ex
tra policemen in Chinatown to seaich
highbinders for weapons and to take ac
tion which would lead to the arrest and
deportation of recognized highbinders. He
also urged that action "be taken in Wash
ington, and at his instigation the Six Com
panies held a meeting last night, which
was attended by the Chinese Consul, and
considered a course which would lead to a
cessation of hostilities. The old schema,
of appointing. Chinese detectives, whose
business It is to accompany (he police arid
point out' highbinders, and which has bo
often proved ineffective, was resorted to,
and to-day eight Chinese sleuths will as
sist the officers.
The Sam Yups, who largely compose the
Six Companies, had the additional reward
for murderers who operate In business
houses raised from $300 to $500. A proposi
tion was also made to reward witnesses in
murder trials so that they can take their
flight from the city at the close of the
cases and escape the heathen vengeance
which would otherwise be visited upon
them.-
Further trouble is anticipated at any
time. It is said that the Wai Ting Tong
men may pursue the same tactics resort
ed' to by the Suey Sings yesterday and
commence the slaughter " of merchants,
members of rival organizations. The great
desire which has possessed Chinatown to
wipe out of existence the Suey Sings would
Indicate that no special effort will be
made to call a halt In the war until they
are sufficiently punished.
As < yet co trace of the assassins has
been discovered. Detective Ed Gibson and
Sergeant Shea are at work on the case.
This Is the first killing in a highbinder
feud where merchants suffered the aeatn
penalty since famous Little Pete s mur
der. The war is on with a vengeance and
all Chinatown is aroused.
declared that he saw McCauley In front
of his car crossing the track but cot until
It was too late to prevent the accident.
Deceased was 70 years old. a native of
-Ohio, and lived at 228 Twelfth street. For
many years the old man worked In tha
La Grande laundry. .\-
the Suey Sing highbinder, on Sunday
night, the escape was not made according
to the strict letter of a previously pre
pared plan. Darting up the narrow, dingy
stairway at 615 Jacksen street the mur
derers met an .obstacle in their way at
the opening of the roof. Exit that way
was barred by a door, but this was beaten
down and the Chinese assassins scattered
through the adjoining buildings, entrance
to which having been secured by open
ings in the roofs. There are several white
witnesses to the crime and to the first
part of the course the murders took In
their escape.
The murder of Low Son and Pon Kue Is
likely to cause further complications to
arise in the highbinder war. The two
men, it is said, were not members of any
tong engaged in the present trouble, but
belonged to the Sam Yup Society, which,
is in the main composed of merchants,
i The Wai Ting Tong, one of the tongs ar
rayed against the Suey Sings, Is also a
Sam Yup ramification, and at Its door Is
laid the responsibility of the recent slay
ing of one Suey Sing man and the Injuring
of another.
The Suey Sings, odds against them,
thirsted for revenge. They had spared
their adversaries thus far, put when Jue
Hok was shot down Sunday night they de
termined to take action and sent' their
hatchetmen forth. They feared to meet
the members of the Wai Ting Tong, all of
whom are recognized fighters, and picked
inoffensive merchants, determined to gall
the Sam Yup Society simply because the
Wai Tings were counted on its roll call.
There is little likelihood of complica
tions between the See Yups and SamYups.
The Wai Ting Tong Is the only branch
of the Sam Yups engaged in the war and
this tong is banded with the Sin Sue Ying
and the Hop Sing tongs, both See Yup or
ganizations, against the Suey Slnga, which
is also a See Yup tong.- At the present
time sentiment in Chinatown is against
the Suey Sings and every assistance will
be given in crushing them out of exist
ence forever. Even the See Yup Society,
two branches of which are already flght
lng-them, would gladly, welcome the day
when the Sueys will cease to exist, as
their high-handed record of lawlessness
during the past few years has brought
ruin to everybody associated with them. .
RECORD OF BLOOD.
SEVEN dead and four seriously wounded is the record of the highbinders
for the past three months. During that time one war has been fought and
another commenced. In each Instance of lawlessness the perpetrators of
the crimes escaped and have never been captured. The trouble which
cost two lives yesterday is far from a settlement, and more victims will be
added to the long death list before peace can be again restored. The roll of
blood follows:

TWO members of the Sam Tup So
ciety were shot and killed by Suey
Sing Tong highbinders at an early
hour yesterday morning. A third
now resting on a cot in the City
Receiving Hospital wm also struck by
bullets fired In the fusillade but will re
cover. The Sam Tups, both of whom
were respectable merchants and prom
inent In tong circles, fell victims in the
crusade of lawlessness that the Suey Sing
Tong, angered by recent defeats, might
score in blood on the Wai Ting Tong,
which is a ramification of the society to
which the dead men belonged.
â¢ The latest victims of the Chinese society
war were Low Son and Pon Kue, partners
In the pork business on the southwest cor
ner of Jackson street and Fish alley. The
store goes under the firm name of Tuck,
Wo & Co., all the members of which are
attached to the Sam Yup Society. Five
Chinese are guilty of the crime, and nono
have as yet been apprehended by the po
Â° " e Audacity of Oie Deed.
With a bold disregard for the law and
without the shadow of fear for the polico
the murderers, five in number, entered
the store of Low Son and Pon Kue at 6;5u
yesterday morning. The visit was timed
and the work mapped out to a nicety. At
that hour Chinatown is rid of policemen,
the officers going on and off their beats.
Furthermore, the special watchman,
George Downey, employed by the pork
merchants, had Just left the store. The
time was thus ripe for the deadly deed
of the highbinders.
Busy with the preparations of the day's
opening Low Son and Pon Kue were or
dering and arranging their stock of meats
and vegetables wtien a band of five Celes
tials, all young men, entered the store. No
words were wasted nor was any time
lost. As soon as the highbinders were
within the doors they drew their weapons
and began a fusillade. Pon Kue, who was
at the time burdened with a pack of fish
which he was carrying toward the front
of the store, was the first live mark for
the highbinders. Two shots were fired
Into his body and he dropped In his tracks.
The murderers next turned their atten
tion to Low Son. He was fairly riddled
with bullets, five shots having been tired
into him before the murderers looked for
other game.
There was a scattering of the other em
ployes at this juncture, but all dil not
escape. Leong Chew, while attempting to
cover himself behind a bulwark of boef,
was shot in the leg. Another Mongolian,
who was in the act of sweeping, nearly
received the "Quieting dose of lead." for
his broom handle was perforated with a
bullet. The shots made a rattling fire ami
brought a crowd on the streets, who col
lected about the store just in time to see
the murderers make their escape. With
their smoking weapons in their hands the
highbinders ran down Jackson street and
disappeared in the lodging-house No. 615.
Two of them were afterward seen to have
emerged from 600, a few doors below.

in that line "she "dabbles" In mining
stocks. She cared for Mrs. Craven when
the' latter was sick In August and Sep
tember, 1891, at the Colonial Hotel. She

Did Not Admit His Authority.
On one of these occasions, after .Mrs.
Craven had made her will the Senator
took Mrs. Cosack to task for allowing
such a thing to occur.
"He told me I was the nurse In charge
and had no right to allow Mrs. Craven to
make her will," testified Mrs. Cosack. "I
was not accustomed to being addressed
In that way and told him I did not recog
nize his authority in the matter. He re
plied that the patient was his betrothed
wife and he had to look out for her, and
turning to Mrs. Craven he said: 'Isn t
that so, my dearie?"
"Later, while I was at the Mission
Grammar School visiting Mrs. Craven the
Senator called. I asked when the mar
riage was coming off and he said. Ask
my wife." Mrs. Craven . drew a paper
from her bosom and passed it to the Sen
ator, who In turn handed it to me. I
asked if It was the marriage certificate
and the Senator replied that it was their
marriage contract. I thought it was a
strange way for a Scotch Presbyterian to
get married and told them so. Fair gave
